Aiyakannu Nayakar, in support of the\r\ncaste claim to be returned as Kshatriyas, for details concerning\r\nwhich claim I must refer the reader to the book itself. In 1907,\r\na book entitled Varuna Darpanam (Mirror of Castes) was published,\r\nin which an attempt is made to connect the caste with the Pallavas.\r\n\r\nKulasekhara, one of the early Travancore kings, and one of the most\r\nrenowned Alwars reverenced by the Sri Vaishnava community in Southern\r\nIndia, is claimed by the Pallis as a king of their caste. Even now,\r\nat the Parthasarathi temple in Triplicane (in the city of Madras),\r\nwhich according to inscriptions is a Pallava temple, Pallis celebrate\r\nhis anniversary with great éclat. The Pallis of Komalesvaranpettah in\r\nthe city of Madras have a Kulasekhara Perumal Sabha, which manages the\r\ncelebration of the anniversary. The temple has recently been converted\r\nat considerable cost into a temple for the great Alwar. A similar\r\ncelebration is held at the Chintadripettah Adikesava Perumal temple\r\nin Madras. The Pallis have the right to present the most important\r\ncamphor offering of the Mylapore Siva temple. They allege that the\r\ntemple was originally theirs, but by degrees they lost their hold over\r\nit until this bare right was left to them. Some years ago, there was\r\na dispute concerning the exercise of this right, and the case came\r\nbefore the High Court of Madras, which decided the point at issue in\r\nfavour of the Pallis. One of the principal gopuras (pyramidal towers)\r\nof the Ekamranatha temple at Big Conjeeveram, the ancient capital of\r\nthe Pallavas, is known as Palligopuram. The Pallis of that town claim\r\nit as their own, and repair it from time to time. In like manner,\r\nthey claim that the founder of the Chidambaram temple, by name Sweta\r\nVarman, subsequently known as Hiranya Varman (sixth century A.D.) was\r\na Pallava king. At Pichavaram, four miles east of Chidambaram, lives\r\na Palli family, which claims to be descended from Hiranya Varman. A\r\ncurious ceremony is even now celebrated at the Chidambaram temple,\r\non the steps leading to the central sanctuary. As soon as the eldest\r\nson of this family is married, he and his wife, accompanied by a\r\nlocal Vellala, repair to the sacred shrine, and there, amidst crowds\r\nof their castemen and others, a homam (sacrificial fire) is raised,\r\nand offerings are made to it. The couple are then anointed with nine\r\ndifferent kinds of holy water, and the Vellala places the temple\r\ncrown on their heads. The Vellala who officiates at this ceremony,\r\nassisted by the temple priests, is said to belong to the family of a\r\nformer minister of a descendant of Hiranya Varman. It is said that,\r\nas the ceremony is a costly one, and the expenses have to be paid\r\nby the individual who undergoes it, it often happens that the eldest\r\nson of the family has to remain a bachelor for half his lifetime. The\r\nPallis who reside at St. Thomé in the city of Madras allege that they\r\nbecame Christians, with their King Kandappa Raja, who, they say,\r\nruled over Mylapore during the time of the visit of St. Thomas. In\r\n1907, Mr. T. Varadappa Nayakar, the only High Court Vakil (pleader)\r\namong the Palli community practising in Madras, brought out a Tamil\r\nbook on the history of the connection of the caste with the ancient\r\nPallava kings.\r\n\r\nIn reply to one of a series of questions promulgated by the Census\r\nSuperintendent, it was stated that \"the caste is known by the\r\nfollowing names:--Agnikulas and Vanniyas. The etymology of these\r\nis the same, being derived from the Sanskrit Agni or Vahni, meaning\r\nfire. The following, taken from Dr. Oppert's article on the original\r\ninhabitants of Bharatavarsa or India, explains the name of the caste\r\nwith its etymology:--'The word Vanniyan is generally derived from the\r\nSanskrit Vahni, fire. Agni, the god of fire, is connected with regal\r\noffice, as kings hold in their hands the fire-wheel or Agneya-chakra,\r\nand the Vanniyas urge in support of their name the regal descent they\r\nclaim.' The existence of these fire races, Agnikula or Vahnikula\r\n(Vanniya), in North and South India is a remarkable fact. No one\r\ncan refuse to a scion of the non-Aryan warrior tribe the title of\r\nRajputra, but in so doing we establish at once Aryan and non-Aryan\r\nRajaputras or Rajputs. The Vanniyan of South India may be accepted\r\nas a representative of the non-Aryan Rajput element.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Vanniyan is, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes, [1] \"derived from the\r\nSanskrit vanhi (fire) in consequence of the following legend. In the\r\nolden times, two giants named Vatapi and Mahi, worshipped Brahma with\r\nsuch devotion that they obtained from him immunity from death from\r\nevery cause save fire, which element they had carelessly omitted\r\nto include in their enumeration. Protected thus, they harried the\r\ncountry, and Vatapi went the length of swallowing Vayu, the god\r\nof the winds, while Mahi devoured the sun. The earth was therefore\r\nenveloped in perpetual darkness and stillness, a condition of affairs\r\nwhich struck terror into the minds of the devatas, and led them to\r\nappeal to Brahma. He, recollecting the omission made by the giants,\r\ndirected his suppliants to desire the rishi Jambava Mahamuni to perform\r\na yagam, or sacrifice by fire. The order having been obeyed, armed\r\nhorse men sprung from the flames, who undertook twelve expeditions\r\nagainst Vatapi and Mahi, whom they first destroyed, and afterwards\r\nreleased Vayu and the sun from their bodies. Their leader then assumed\r\nthe government of the country under the name Rudra Vanniya Maharaja,\r\nwho had five sons, the ancestors of the Vanniya caste. These facts are\r\nsaid to be recorded in the Vaidiswara temple in the Tanjore district.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vaidiswara temple here referred to is the Vaidiswara kovil\r\nnear Shiyali. Mr. Stuart adds that \"this tradition alludes to the\r\ndestruction of the city of Vapi by Narasimha Varma, king of the Pallis\r\nor Pallavas.\" Vapi, or Va-api, was the ancient name of Vatapi or\r\nBadami in the Bombay Presidency. It was the capital of the Chalukyas,\r\nwho, during the seventh century, were at feud with the Pallavas\r\nof the south. \"The son of Mahendra Varman I,\" writes Rai Bahadur\r\nV. Venkayya, \"was Narasimha Varman I, who retrieved the fortunes of\r\nthe family by repeatedly defeating the Cholas, Keralas, Kalabhras, and\r\nPandyas. He also claims to have written the word victory as on a plate\r\non Pulikesin's [2] back, which was caused to be visible (i.e., which\r\nwas turned in flight after defeat) at several battles. Narasimha Varman\r\ncarried the war into Chalukyan territory, and actually captured Vatapi\r\ntheir capital. This claim of his is established by an inscription\r\nfound at Badami, from which it appears that Narasimha Varman bore the\r\ntitle Mahamalla. In later times, too, this Pallava king was known as\r\nVatapi Konda Narasingapottaraiyan. Dr. Fleet assigns the capture of\r\nthe Chalukya capital to about A.D. 642. The war of Narasimha Varman\r\nwith Pulikesin is mentioned in the Sinhalese chronicle Mahavamsa. It\r\nis also hinted at in the Tamil Periyapuranam. The well-known saint\r\nSiruttonda, who had his only son cut up and cooked in order to satisfy\r\nthe appetite of the god Siva disguised as a devotee, is said to have\r\nreduced to dust the city of Vatapi for his royal master, who could\r\nbe no other than the Pallava king Narasimha Varman.\"\r\n\r\nI gather, from a note by Mr. F. R. Hemingway, that the Pallis \"tell\r\na long story of how they are descendants of one Vira Vanniyan,\r\nwho was created by a sage named Sambuha when he was destroying the\r\ntwo demons named Vatapi and Enatapi. This Vira Vanniyan married a\r\ndaughter of the god Indra, and had five sons, named Rudra, Brahma,\r\nKrishna, Sambuha, and Kai, whose descendants now live respectively\r\nin the country north of the Palar in the Cauvery delta, between the\r\nPalar and Pennar. They have written a Puranam and a drama bearing on\r\nthis tale. They declare that they are superior to Brahmans, since,\r\nwhile the latter must be invested with the sacred thread after birth,\r\nthey bring their sacred thread with them at birth itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Vanniyans,\" Mr. Nelson states, [3] \"are at the present time a\r\nsmall and obscure agricultural caste, but there is reason to believe\r\nthat they are descendants of ancestors who, in former times, held a\r\ngood position among the tribes of South India. A manuscript, abstracted\r\nat page 90 of the Catalogue raisonné (Mackenzie Manuscripts), states\r\nthat the Vanniyans belong to the Agnikula, and are descended from\r\nthe Muni Sambhu; and that they gained victories by means of their\r\nskill in archery. And another manuscript, abstracted at page 427,\r\nshows that two of their chiefs enjoyed considerable power, and\r\nrefused to pay the customary tribute to the Rayar, who was for a\r\nlong time unable to reduce them to submission. Armies of Vanniyans\r\nare often mentioned in Ceylon annals. And a Hindu History of Ceylon,\r\ntranslated in the Royal As. Soc. Journal, Vol. XXIV, states that, in\r\nthe year 3300 of the Kali Yuga, a Pandya princess went over to Ceylon,\r\nand married its king, and was accompanied by sixty bands of Vanniyans.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms Vanni and Vanniyan are used in Tamil poems to denote\r\nking. Thus, in the classical Tamil poem Kalladam, which has been\r\nattributed to the time of Tiruvalluvar, the author of the sacred Kural,\r\nVanni is used in the sense of king. Kamban, the author of the Tamil\r\nRamayana, uses it in a similar sense. In an inscription dated 1189\r\nA.D., published by Dr. E. Hultzsch, [4] Vanniya Nayan appears among\r\nthe titles of the local chief of Tiruchchuram, who made a grant of\r\nland to the Vishnu temple at Manimangalam. Tiruchchuram is identical\r\nwith Tiruvidaichuram about four miles south-east of Chingleput,\r\nwhere there is a ruined fort, and also a Siva temple celebrated in\r\nthe hymns of Tirugnana Sambandhar, the great Saiva saint who lived in\r\nthe 9th century. Local tradition, confirmed by one of the Mackenzie\r\nmanuscripts, [5] says that this place was, during the time of the\r\nVijayanagar King Krishna Raya (1509-30 A.D.), ruled over by two feudal\r\nchiefs of the Vanniya caste named Kandavarayan and Sendavarayan. They,\r\nit is said, neglected to pay tribute to their sovereign lord, who\r\nsent an army to exact it. The brothers proved invincible, but one of\r\ntheir dancing-girls was guilty of treachery. Acting under instructions,\r\nshe poisoned Kandavarayan. His brother Sendavarayan caught hold of her\r\nand her children, and drowned them in the local tank. The tank and the\r\nhillock close by still go by the name of Kuppichi kulam and Kuppichi\r\nkunru, after Kuppi the dancing-girl. An inscription of the Vijayanagar\r\nking Deva Raya II (1419-44 A.D.) gives him the title of the lord who\r\ntook the heads of the eighteen Vanniyas. [6] This inscription records\r\na grant by one Muttayya Nayakan, son of Mukka Nayakan of Vanniraya\r\ngotram. Another inscription, [7] dated 1456 A.D., states that, when\r\none Raja Vallabha ruled at Conjeeveram, a general, named Vanniya Chinna\r\nPillai, obtained a piece of land at Sattankad near Madras. Reference is\r\nmade by Orme [8] to the assistance which the Vaniah of Sevagherry gave\r\nMuhammad Yusuf in his reduction of Tinnevelly in 1757. The Vaniah here\r\nreferred to is the Zamindar of Sivagiri in the Tinnevelly district,\r\na Vanniya by caste. Vanniyas are mentioned in Ceylon archives. Wanni\r\nis the name of a district in Ceylon. It is, Mr. W. Hamilton writes,\r\n[9] \"situated towards Trincomalee in the north-east quarter. At\r\ndifferent periods its Wannies or princes, taking advantage of the\r\nwars between the Candian sovereigns and their European enemies,\r\nendeavoured to establish an authority independent of both, but they\r\nfinally, after their country had been much desolated by all parties,\r\nsubmitted to the Dutch.\" Further, Sir J. E. Tennent writes, [10] that\r\n\"in modern times, the Wanny was governed by native princes styled\r\nWannyahs, and occasionally by females with the title of Wunniches.\"\r\n\r\nThe terms Sambhu and Sambhava Rayan are connected with the Pallis. The\r\nstory goes that Agni was the original ancestor of all kings. His\r\nson was Sambhu, whose descendants called themselves Sambhukula, or\r\nthose of the Sambhu family. Some inscriptions [11] of the time of\r\nthe Chola kings Kulottunga III and Raja Raja III record Sambukula\r\nPerumal Sambuvarayan and Alagiya Pallavan Edirili Sola Sambuvarayan\r\nas titles of local chiefs. A well-known verse of Irattayar in praise\r\nof Conjeeveram Ekamranathaswami refers to the Pallava king as being\r\nof the Sambu race. The later descendants of the Pallavas apparently\r\ntook Sambuvarayar and its allied forms as their titles, as the Pallis\r\nin Tanjore and South Arcot still do. At Conjeeveram there lives\r\nthe family of the Mahanattar of the Vanniyans, which calls itself\r\n\"of the family of Vira Sambu.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name Vanniyan,\" Mr. H. A. Stuart writes, [12] seems to have\r\nbeen introduced by the Brahmans, possibly to gratify the desire of\r\nthe Pallis for genealogical distinction. Padaiyachi means a soldier,\r\nand is also of late origin. That the Pallis were once an influential\r\nand independent community may be admitted, and in their present desire\r\nto be classed as Kshatriyas they are merely giving expression to this\r\nbelief, but, unless an entirely new meaning is to be given to the term\r\nKshatriya, their claim must be dismissed as absurd. After the fall of\r\nthe Pallava dynasty, the Pallis became agricultural servants under the\r\nVellalas, and it is only since the advent of British rule that they\r\nhave begun to assert their claims to a higher position.\" Further,\r\nMr. W. Francis writes [13] that \"this caste has been referred to\r\nas being one of those which are claiming for themselves a position\r\nhigher than that which Hindu society is inclined to accord them. Their\r\nancestors were socially superior to themselves, but they do not content\r\nthemselves with stating this, but in places are taking to wearing the\r\nsacred thread of the twice-born, and claim to be Kshatriyas. They\r\nhave published pamphlets to prove their descent from that caste,\r\nand they returned themselves in thousands, especially in Godavari, as\r\nAgnikula Kshatriyas or Vannikula Kshatriyas, meaning Kshatriyas of the\r\nfire race.\" \"As a relic,\" it has been said, [14] \"of the origin of the\r\nVannikula Kshatriyas from fire, the fire-pot, which comes in procession\r\non a fixed day during the annual festivities of Draupadi and other\r\ngoddesses, is borne on the head of a Vanniya. Also, in dramatic plays,\r\nthe king personæ (sic) has always been taken by a Kshatriya, who is\r\ngenerally a Vanniya. These peculiarities, however, are becoming common\r\nnow-a-days, when privileges peculiar to one caste are being trenched\r\nupon by other caste men. In the Tirupporur temple, the practice of\r\nbeating the mazhu (red-hot iron) is done by a dancing-girl serving\r\nthe Vanniya caste. The privilege of treading on the fire is also\r\npeculiar to the Vanniyas.\" It is recorded by Mr. Francis [15] that,\r\nin the South Arcot district, \"Draupadi's temples are very numerous,\r\nand the priest at them is generally a Palli by caste, and Pallis take\r\nthe leading part in the ceremonies at them. Why this should be so is\r\nnot clear. The Pallis say it is because both the Pandava brothers and\r\nthemselves were born of fire, and are therefore related. Festivals to\r\nDraupadi always involve two points of ritual--the recital or acting\r\nof a part of the Mahabharata and a fire-walking ceremony. The first\r\nof these is usually done by the Pallis, who are very fond of the great\r\nepic, and many of whom know it uncommonly well. [In the city of Madras\r\nthere are several Draupadi Amman temples belonging to the Pallis. The\r\nfire-walking ceremony cannot be observed thereat without the help of\r\na member of this caste, who is the first to walk over the hot ashes.]\r\n\r\nKuvvakkam is known for its festival to Aravan (more correctly Iravan)\r\nor Kuttandar, which is one of the most popular feasts with Sudras\r\nin the whole district. Aravan was the son of Arjuna, one of the five\r\nPandava brothers. Local tradition says that, when the great war which\r\nis described in the Mahabharata was about to begin, the Kauravas,\r\nthe opponents of the Pandavas, sacrificed, to bring them success, a\r\nwhite elephant. The Pandavas were in despair of being able to find any\r\nsuch uncommon object with which to propitiate the gods, until Arjuna\r\nsuggested that they should offer up his son Aravan. Aravan agreed\r\nto yield his life for the good of the cause, and, when eventually\r\nthe Pandavas were victorious, he was deified for the self-abnegation\r\nwhich had thus brought his side success. Since he died in his youth,\r\nbefore he had been married, it is held to please him if men, even\r\nthough grown up and already wedded, come now and offer to espouse him,\r\nand men who are afflicted with serious diseases take a vow to marry\r\nhim at his annual festival in the hope of thereby being cured. The\r\nfestival occurs in May, and for eighteen nights the Mahabharata is\r\nrecited by a Palli, large numbers of people, especially of that caste,\r\nassembling to hear it read. On the eighteenth night, a wooden image\r\nof Kuttandar is taken to a tope (grove), and seated there. This is\r\nthe signal for the sacrifice of an enormous number of fowls. Every\r\none who comes brings one or two, and the number killed runs literally\r\ninto thousands. Such sacrifices are most uncommon in South Arcot,\r\nthough frequent enough in other parts of the Presidency--the Ceded\r\nDistricts for example--and this instance is noteworthy. While this\r\nis going on, all the men who have taken vows to be married to the\r\ndeity appear before his image dressed like women, make obeisance,\r\noffer to the priest (who is a Palli by caste) a few annas, and give\r\ninto his hands the talis (marriage badges) which they have brought\r\nwith them. These the priest, as representing the God, ties round\r\ntheir necks. The God is brought back to his shrine that night,\r\nand when in front of the building he is hidden by a cloth being\r\nheld before him. This symbolises the sacrifice of Aravan, and the\r\nmen who have just been married to him set up loud lamentations at\r\nthe death of their husband. Similar vows are taken and ceremonies\r\nperformed, it is said, at the shrines to Kuttandar at Kottattai (two\r\nmiles north-west of Porto Novo), and Adivarahanattum (five miles\r\nnorth-west of Chidambaram), and, in recent years, at Tiruvarkkulam\r\n(one mile east of the latter place); other cases probably occur.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pallis, Mr. Francis writes further, [16] \"as far back as 1833\r\ntried to procure a decree in Pondicherry, declaring that they were\r\nnot a low caste, and of late years they have, in this (South Arcot)\r\ndistrict, been closely bound together by an organisation managed by\r\none of their caste, who was a prominent person in these parts. In\r\nSouth Arcot they take a somewhat higher social rank than in other\r\nplaces--Tanjore, for example--and their esprit de corps is now\r\nsurprisingly strong. They are tending gradually to approach the\r\nBrahmanical standard of social conduct, discouraging adult marriage,\r\nmeat-eating, and widow re-marriage, and they also actively repress\r\nopen immorality or other social sins, which might serve to give the\r\ncommunity a bad name. In 1904 a document came before one of the courts,\r\nwhich showed that, in the year previous, the representatives of the\r\ncaste in thirty-four villages in this district had bound themselves\r\nin writing, under penalty of excommunication, to refrain (except with\r\nthe consent of all parties) from the practices formerly in existence\r\nof marrying two wives, and of allowing a woman to marry again during\r\nthe lifetime of her first husband. Some of the caste have taken to\r\ncalling themselves Vannikula Kshatriyas or Agnikula Kshatriyas, and\r\nothers even declare that they are Brahmans. These last always wear\r\nthe sacred thread, tie their cloths in the Brahman fashion (though\r\ntheir women do not follow the Brahman ladies in this matter), forbid\r\nwidow remarriage, and are vegetarians.\"\r\n\r\nSome Palli Poligars have very high-sounding names, such as Agni Kudirai\r\nEriya Raya Ravutha Minda Nainar, i.e., Nainar who conquered Raya\r\nRavutha and mounted a fire horse. This name is said to commemorate a\r\ncontest between a Palli and a Ravutha, at which the former sat on a\r\nred-hot metal horse. Further names are Samidurai Surappa Sozhaganar\r\nand Anjada Singam (fearless lion). Some Pallis have adopted Gupta as\r\na title.\r\n\r\nA few Palli families now maintain a temple of their own, dedicated\r\nto Srinivasa, at the village of Kumalam in the South Arcot district,\r\nlive round the temple, and are largely dependent on it for their\r\nlivelihood. Most of them dress exactly like the temple Battars, and a\r\nstranger would certainly take them for Battar Brahmans. Some of them\r\nare well versed in the temple ritual, and their youths are being\r\ntaught the Sandyavandhana (morning prayer) and Vedas by a Brahman\r\npriest. Ordinary Palli girls are taken by them in marriage, but their\r\nown girls are not allowed to marry ordinary Pallis; and, as a result of\r\nthis practice of hypergamy, the Kumalam men sometimes have to take to\r\nthemselves more than one wife, in order that their young women may be\r\nprovided with husbands. These Kumalam Pallis are regarded as priests\r\nof the Pallis, and style themselves Kovilar, or temple people. But,\r\nby other castes, they are nicknamed Kumalam Brahmans. They claim to\r\nbe Kshatriyas, and have adopted the title Rayar.\r\n\r\nOther titles, \"indicating authority, bravery, and superiority,\"\r\nassumed by Pallis are Nayakar, Varma, Padaiyachi (head of an army),\r\nKandar, Chera, Chola, Pandya, Nayanar, Udaiyar, Samburayar, etc. [17]\r\nStill further titles are Pillai, Reddi, Goundan, and Kavandan. Some\r\nsay that they belong to the Chola race, and that, as such, they should\r\nbe called Chembians. [18] Iranya Varma, the name of one of the early\r\nPallava kings, was returned as their caste by certain wealthy Pallis,\r\nwho also gave themselves the title of Solakanar (descendant of Chola\r\nkings) at the census, 1901.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a question by the Census Superintendent, 1891, as to\r\nthe names of the sub-divisions of the caste, it was stated that \"the\r\nVanniyans are either of the solar and lunar or Agnikula race, or Ruthra\r\nVanniyar, Krishna Vanniyar, Samboo Vanniyar, Brahma Vanniyar, and\r\nIndra Vanniyar.\" The most important of the sub-divisions returned at\r\nthe census were Agamudaiyan, Agni, Arasu (Raja), Kshatriya, Nagavadam\r\n(cobra's hood, or ear ornament of that shape), Nattaman, Olai (palm\r\nleaf), Pandamuttu, and Perumal gotra. Pandamuttu is made by Winslow\r\nto mean torches arranged so as to represent an elephant. But the\r\nPallis derive the name from panda muttu, or touching the pandal,\r\nin reference to the pile of marriage pots reaching to the top of\r\nthe pandal. The lowest pot is decorated with figures of elephants\r\nand horses. At a marriage among the Pandamuttu Pallis, the bride\r\nand bridegroom, in token of their Kshatriya descent, are seated on a\r\nraised dais, which represents a simhasanam or throne. The bride wears\r\na necklace of glass beads with the tali, and the officiating priest\r\nis a Telugu Brahman. Other sub-castes of the Pallis, recorded in the\r\nCensus Report, 1901, are Kallangi in Chingleput, bearing the title\r\nReddi, and Kallaveli, or Kallan's fence, in the Madura district. The\r\noccupational title Kottan (bricklayer) was returned by some Pallis\r\nin Coimbatore. In the Salem district some Pallis are divided into\r\nAnju-nal (five days) and Pannendu-nal (twelve days), according as\r\nthey perform the final death ceremonies on the fifth or twelfth day\r\nafter death, to distinguish them from those who perform them on the\r\nsixteenth day. [19] Another division of Pallis in the Salem district\r\nis based on the kind of ear ornament which is worn. The Olai Pallis\r\nwear a circular ornament (olai), and the Nagavadam Pallis wear an\r\nornament in shape like a cobra and called nagavadam.\r\n\r\nThe Pallis are classed with the left-hand section. But the Census\r\nSuperintendent, 1871, records that \"the wives of the agricultural\r\nlabourers (Pallis) side with the left hand, while the husbands help in\r\nfighting the battles of the right; and the shoe-makers' (Chakkiliyan)\r\nwives also take the side opposed to their husbands. During these\r\nfactional disturbances, the ladies deny to their husbands all the\r\nprivileges of the connubial state.\" This has not, however, been\r\nconfirmed in recent investigations into the customs of the caste.\r\n\r\nThe Pallis are Saivites or Vaishnavites, but are also demonolaters,\r\nand worship Mutyalamma, Mariamma, Ayanar, Muneswara, Ankalamma, and\r\nother minor deities. Writing nearly a century ago concerning the Vana\r\nPallis settled at Kolar in Mysore, Buchanan states [20] that \"they are\r\nmuch addicted to the worship of the saktis, or destructive powers,\r\nand endeavour to avert their wrath by bloody sacrifices. These are\r\nperformed by cutting off the animal's head before the door of the\r\ntemple, and invoking the deity to partake of the sacrifice. There is\r\nno altar, nor is the blood sprinkled on the image, and the body serves\r\nthe votaries for a feast. The Pallivanlu have temples dedicated to\r\na female spirit of this kind named Mutialamma, and served by pujaris\r\n(priests) of their own caste. They also offer sacrifices to Mariamma,\r\nwhose pujaris are Kurubaru.\"\r\n\r\nHuge human figures, representing Mannarswami in a sitting posture,\r\nconstructed of bricks and mortar, and painted, are conspicuous objects\r\nin the vicinity of the Lawrence Asylum Press, Mount Road, and in the\r\nKottawal bazar, Madras. At the village of Tirumalavayal near Avadi,\r\nthere is a similar figure as tall as a palmyra palm, with a shrine\r\nof Pachaiamman close by. Mannarswami is worshipped mainly by Pallis\r\nand Beri Chettis. An annual festival is held in honour of Pachaiamman\r\nand Mannarswami, in which the Beri Chettis take a prominent part.\r\n\r\nDuring the festivals of village deities, the goddess is frequently\r\nrepresented by a pile of seven pots, called karagam, decorated with\r\ngarlands and flowers. Even when there is an idol in the temple,\r\nthe karagam is set up in a corner thereof, and taken daily, morning\r\nand evening, in procession, carried on the head of a pujari or other\r\nperson. On the last day of the festival, the karagam is elaborately\r\ndecorated with parrots, dolls, flowers, etc., made of pith (Æschynomene\r\naspera), and called pu karagam (flower pot).\r\n\r\nThe Pallis live in separate streets or quarters distinctively known\r\nas the Palli teru or Kudi teru (ryots' quarter). The bulk of them\r\nare labourers, but many now farm their own lands, while others are\r\nengaged in trade or in Government service. The occupations of those\r\nwhom I have examined at Madras and Chingleput were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Merchant.\r\n    Cultivator.\r\n    Bullock and pony cart driver.\r\n    Printer.\r\n    Lascar.\r\n    Sweetmeat vendor.\r\n    Flower vendor.\r\n    Fitter.\r\n    Sawyer.\r\n    Oil-presser.\r\n    Gardener.\r\n    Polisher.\r\n    Bricklayer.\r\n    Mason.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the Chingleput Palli men were tattooed, like the Irulas,\r\nwith a dot or vertical stripe on the forehead. Some Irulas, it may\r\nbe noted en passant, call themselves Ten (honey) Vanniyans, or Vana\r\n(forest) Pallis.\r\n\r\nLike many other castes, the Pallis have their own caste beggars,\r\ncalled Nokkan, who receive presents at marriages and on other\r\noccasions. The time-honoured panchayat system still prevails, and\r\nthe caste has headmen, entitled Perithanakkaran or Nattamaikkaran,\r\nwho decide all social matters affecting the community, and must be\r\npresent at the ceremonial distribution of pansupari.\r\n\r\nThe Kovilars, and some others who aspire to a high social status,\r\npractice infant marriage, but adult marriage is the rule. At the\r\nbetrothal ceremony, the future bridegroom goes to the house of his\r\nprospective father-in-law, where the headman of the future bride must\r\nbe present. The bridegroom's headman or father places on a tray betel,\r\nflowers, the bride-price (pariyam) in money or jewels, the milk money\r\n(mulapal kuli), and a cocoanut. Milk money is the present given to\r\nthe mother of the bride, in return for her having given nourishment\r\nto the girl during her infancy. All these things are handed by\r\nthe bridegroom's headman to the father or headman of the bride,\r\nsaying \"The money is yours. The girl is ours.\" The bride's father,\r\nreceiving them, says \"The money is mine. The girl is yours.\" This\r\nperformance is repeated thrice, and pan-supari is distributed, the\r\nfirst recipient being the maternal uncle. The ceremony is in a way\r\nbinding, and marriage, as a rule, follows close on the betrothal. If,\r\nin the interval, a girl's intended husband dies, she may marry some\r\none else. A girl may not marry without the consent of her maternal\r\nuncle, and, if he disapproves of a match, he has the right to carry\r\nher off even when the ceremony is in progress, and marry her to a\r\nman of his selection. It is stated, in the Vannikula Vilakkam, that\r\nat a marriage among the Pallis \"the bride, after her betrothal, is\r\nasked to touch the bow and sword of the bridegroom. The latter adorns\r\nhimself with all regal pomp, and, mounting a horse, goes in procession\r\nto the bride's house where the marriage ceremony is celebrated.\"\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony is, in ordinary cases, completed in one day,\r\nbut the tendency is to spread it over three days, and introduce the\r\nstandard Puranic form of ritual. On the day preceding the wedding-day,\r\nthe bride is brought in procession to the house of the bridegroom,\r\nand the marriage pots are brought by a woman of the potter caste. On\r\nthe wedding morning, the marriage dais is got ready, and the milk-post,\r\npots, and lights are placed thereon. Bride and bridegroom go separately\r\nthrough the nalagu ceremony. They are seated on a plank, and five women\r\nsmear them with oil by means of a culm of grass (Cynodon Dactylon),\r\nand afterwards with Phaseolus Mungo (green gram) paste. Water coloured\r\nwith turmeric and chunam (arathi) is then waved round them, to avert\r\nthe evil eye, and they are conducted to the bathing-place. While they\r\nare bathing, five small cakes are placed on various parts of the\r\nbody--knees, shoulders, head, etc. When the bridegroom is about to\r\nleave the spot, cooked rice, contained in a sieve, is waved before\r\nhim, and thrown away. The bridal couple are next taken three times\r\nround the dais, and they offer pongal (cooked rice) to the village\r\nand house gods and the ancestors, in five pots, in which the rice has\r\nbeen very carefully prepared, so as to avoid pollution of any kind,\r\nby a woman who has given birth to a first child. They then dress\r\nthemselves in their wedding finery, and get ready for the tying of\r\nthe tali. Meanwhile, the milk-post, made of Odina Wodier, Erythrina\r\nindica, or the handle of a plough, has been set up. At its side are\r\nplaced a grindstone, a large pot, and two lamps called kuda-vilakku\r\n(pot light) and alankara-vilakku (ornamental light). The former\r\nconsists of a lighted wick in an earthenware tray placed on a pot,\r\nand the latter of a wooden stand with several branches supporting a\r\nnumber of lamps. It is considered an unlucky omen if the pot light\r\ngoes out before the conclusion of the ceremonial. It is stated\r\nby Mr. H. A. Stuart [21] that in the North Arcot district \"in the\r\nmarriage ceremony of the Vanniyans or Pallis, the first of the posts\r\nsupporting the booth must be cut from the vanni (Prosopis spicigera),\r\na tree which they hold in much reverence because they believe that\r\nthe five Pandava Princes, who were like themselves Kshatriyas, during\r\nthe last year of their wanderings, deposited their arms in a tree of\r\nthis species. On the tree the arms turned into snakes, and remained\r\nuntouched till the owners' return.\" The Prosopis tree is worshipped\r\nin order to obtain pardon from sins, success over enemies, and the\r\nrealisation of the devotee's wishes.\r\n\r\nWhen the bride and bridegroom come to the wedding booth dressed\r\nin their new clothes, the Brahman purohit gives them the threads\r\n(kankanam), which are to be tied round their wrists. The tali is passed\r\nround to be blessed by those assembled, and handed to the bridegroom,\r\nwho ties it on the bride's neck. While he is so doing, his sister holds\r\na light called Kamakshi vilakku. Kamakshi, the goddess at Conjeeveram,\r\nis a synonym for Siva's consort Parvathi. The music of the flute is\r\nsometimes accompanied by the blowing of the conch shell while the\r\ntali is being tied, and omens are taken from the sounds produced\r\nthereby. The tali-tying ceremony concluded, the couple change their\r\nseats, and the ends of their clothes are tied together. Rice is\r\nthrown on their heads, and in front of them, and the near relations\r\nmay tie gold or silver plates called pattam. The first to do this is\r\nthe maternal uncle. Bride and bridegroom then go round the dais and\r\nmilk-post, and, at the end of the second turn, the bridegroom lifts\r\nthe bride's left foot, and places it on the grindstone. At the end\r\nof the third turn, the brother-in-law, in like manner, places the\r\nbridegroom's left foot on the stone, and puts on a toe-ring. For\r\nso doing, he receives a rupee and betel. The contracting couple are\r\nthen shown the pole-star (Arundhati), and milk and fruit are given\r\nto them. Towards evening, the wrist-threads are removed, and they\r\nproceed to a tank for a mock ploughing ceremony. The bridegroom\r\ncarries a ploughshare, and the bride a small pot containing conji\r\n(rice gruel). A small patch of ground is turned up, and puddled so as\r\nto resemble a miniature field, wherein the bridegroom plants some grain\r\nseedlings. A miniature Pillayar (Ganesa) is made with cow-dung, and\r\nbetel offered to it. The bridegroom then sits down, feigning fatigue,\r\nand the bride gives him a handful of rice, which his brother-in-law\r\ntries to prevent him from eating. The newly-married couple remain\r\nfor about a week at the bride's house, and are then conducted to\r\nthat of the bridegroom, the brother-in-law carrying a hundred or a\r\nhundred and ten cakes. Before they enter the house, coloured water\r\nand a cocoanut are waved in front of them, and, as soon as she puts\r\nfoot within her new home, the bride must touch pots containing rice\r\nand salt with her right hand. A curious custom among the Pallis at\r\nKumbakonam is that the bride's mother, and often all her relatives,\r\nare debarred from attending her marriage. The bride is also kept gosha\r\n(in seclusion) for all the days of the wedding. [22]\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. Hemingway that some of the Pandamuttu Pallis of\r\nthe Trichinopoly district \"practice the betrothal of infant girls,\r\nthe ceremony consisting of pouring cow-dung water into the mouth of\r\nthe baby. They allow a girl to marry a boy younger than herself, and\r\nmake the latter swallow a two-anna bit, to neutralise the disadvantages\r\nof such a match. Weddings are generally performed at the boy's house,\r\nand the bride's mother does not attend. The bride is concealed from\r\nview by a screen.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that, some years ago, a marriage took place at Panruti\r\nnear Cuddalore on the old Svayamvara principle described in the story\r\nof Nala and Damayanti in the Mahabharata. According to this custom,\r\na girl selects a husband from a large number of competitors, who are\r\nassembled for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWidow remarriage is permitted. At the marriage of a widow, the tali\r\nis tied by a married woman, the bridegroom standing by the side,\r\nusually inside the house. Widow marriage is known as naduvittu tali,\r\nas the tali-tying ceremony takes place within the house (naduvidu).\r\n\r\nTo get rid of the pollution of the first menstrual period, holy water\r\nis sprinkled over the girl by a Brahman, after she has bathed. She\r\nseats herself on a plank, and rice cakes (puttu), a pounding stone,\r\nand arathi are waved in front of her. Sugar and betel are then\r\ndistributed among those present.\r\n\r\nThe dead are sometimes burnt, and sometimes buried. As soon as an\r\nindividual dies, the son goes three times round the corpse, carrying\r\nan iron measure (marakkal), wherein a lamp rests on unhusked rice. The\r\ncorpse is washed, and the widow bathes in such a way that the water\r\nfalls on it. Omission to perform this rite would entail disgrace,\r\nand there is an abusive phrase \"May the water from the woman's\r\nbody not fall on that of the corpse.\" The dead man and his widow\r\nexchange betel three times. The corpse is carried to the burning\r\nor burial-ground on a bamboo stretcher, and, on the way thither,\r\nis set down near a stone representing Arichandra, to whom food is\r\noffered. Arichandra was a king who became a slave of the Paraiyans,\r\nand is in charge of the burial-ground. By some Pallis a two-anna\r\npiece is placed on the forehead, and a pot of rice on the breast\r\nof the corpse. These are taken away by the officiating barber and\r\nParaiyan respectively. [23] Men who die before they are married have\r\nto go through a post-mortem mock marriage ceremony. A garland of arka\r\n(Calotropis gigantea) flowers is placed round the neck of the corpse,\r\nand mud from a gutter is shaped into cakes, which, like the cakes at\r\na real marriage, are placed on various parts of the body.\r\n\r\nA curious death ceremony is said by Mr. Hemingway to be observed by\r\nthe Arasu Pallis in the Trichinopoly district. On the day after the\r\nfuneral, two pots of water are placed near the spot where the corpse\r\nwas cremated. If a cow drinks of the water, they think it is the soul\r\nof the dead come to quench its thirst.\r\n\r\nIn some places, Palli women live in strict seclusion (Gosha). This\r\nis particularly the case in the old Palaigar families of Ariyalur,\r\nUdaiyarpalaiyam, Pichavaram, and Sivagiri.\r\n\r\nThe caste has a well-organised Sangham (association) called Chennai\r\nVannikula Kshatriya Maha Sangham, which was established in 1888\r\nby leaders of the caste. Besides creating a strong esprit de corps\r\namong members of the caste in various parts of the Madras Presidency,\r\nit has been instrumental in the opening of seven schools, of which\r\nthree are in Madras, and the others at Conjeeveram, Madhurantakam,\r\nTirukalikundram and Kumalam. It has also established chuttrams\r\n(rest-houses) at five places of pilgrimage. Chengalvaraya Nayakar's\r\nTechnical School, attached to Pachaiappa's College in Madras, was\r\nfounded in 1865 by a member of the Palli caste, who bequeathed a\r\nlarge legacy for its maintenance. There is also an orphanage named\r\nafter him in Madras, for Palli boys. Govindappa Nayakar's School,\r\nwhich forms the lower secondary branch of Pachaiappa's College,\r\nis another institution which owes its existence to the munificence\r\nof a member of the Palli caste. The latest venture of the Pallis is\r\nthe publication of a newspaper called Agnikuladittan (the sun of the\r\nAgnikula), which was started in 1908.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Pallis, Pallilu, or Palles, who are settled in\r\nthe Telugu country as fishermen, carpenters, and agriculturists,\r\nMr. H. A. Stuart writes [24] that \"it seems probable that they are a\r\nbranch of the great Palli or Vanniya tribe, for Buchanan refers to the\r\nMina (fish) Pallis and Vana Pallis.\" As sub-castes of these Pallis,\r\nVada (boatmen), Marakkadu and Edakula are given in the Census Report,\r\n1901. In the North Arcot Manual, Palli is given as a sub-division of\r\nthe Telugu Kapus. In some places the Pallis call themselves Palle\r\nKapulu, and give as their gotram Jambumaharishi, which is a gotram\r\nof the Pallis. Though they do not intermarry, the Palle Kapulu may\r\ninterdine with the Kapus.\r\n\r\nConcerning the caste-beggars of the Pallis, and their legendary\r\nhistory, I read the following account. [25] \"I came upon a noisy\r\nprocession entering one of the main streets of a town not far from\r\nMadras. It was headed by spearmen, swordsmen, and banner-bearers, the\r\nlast carrying huge flags (palempores) with representations of lions,\r\ntigers, monkeys, Brahmany kites, goblins and dwarfs. The centre of\r\nattraction consisted of some half dozen men and women in all the\r\nbravery of painted faces and gay clothing, and armed with swords,\r\nlances, and daggers. Tom-toms, trumpets, cymbals, and horns furnished\r\nthe usual concomitant of ear-piercing music, while the painted men\r\nand women moved, in time with it, their hands and feet, which were\r\nencircled by rows of tiny bells. A motley following of the tag-rag\r\nand bob-tail of the population, which had been allured thither\r\nby the noise and clamour, brought up the rear of the procession,\r\nwhich stopped at each crossing. At each halt, the trumpeters blew\r\na great and sonorous blast, while one of the central figures, with\r\na conspicuous abdominal development, stepped forward, and, in a\r\nstentorian voice, proclaimed the brave deeds performed by them in\r\nthe days gone by, and challenged all comers to try conclusions with\r\nthem, or own themselves beaten. I was told that the chief personages\r\nin the show were Jatipillays (literally, children of the caste),\r\nwho had arrived in the town in the course of their annual tour of\r\nthe country, for collecting their perquisites from all members of\r\nthe Palli or Padiachi caste, and that this was how they announced\r\ntheir arrival. The perquisite levied is known as the talaikattu vari\r\n(poll-tax, or literally the turban tax), a significant expression\r\nwhen it is borne in mind that only the adult male members of the caste\r\n(those who are entitled to tie a cloth round their heads) are liable\r\nto pay it, and not the women and children. It amounts to but one anna\r\nper head, and is easily collected. The Jatipillays also claim occult\r\npowers, and undertake to exhibit their skill in magic by the exorcism\r\nof devils, witchcraft and sorcery, and the removal of spells, however\r\npotent. This operation is called modi edukkirathu, or the breaking of\r\nspells, and sometimes the challenge is taken up by a rival magician\r\nof a different caste. A wager is fixed, and won or lost according\r\nto the superior skill of the challenger or challenged. Entering into\r\nfriendly chat with one of the leading members of the class, I gleaned\r\nthe following legend of its origin, and of the homage accorded to it\r\nby the Pallis. In remote times, when Salivahana was king of the Chola\r\ncountry, with its capital at Conjeeveram, all the principal castes of\r\nSouth India had their head-quarters at the seat of government, where\r\neach, after its own way, did homage to the triple deities of the place,\r\nnamely, Kamakshi Amman, Ekambrasvarar, and Sri Varadarajaswami. Each\r\ncaste got up an annual car festival to these deities. On one of\r\nthese occasions, owing to a difference which had arisen between the\r\nSeniyans (weavers), who form a considerable portion of the population\r\nof Conjeeveram, on one side, and the Pallis or Vanniyans on the\r\nother, some members of the former caste, who were adepts in magic,\r\nthrough sheer malevolence worked spells upon the cars of the Pallis,\r\nwhose progress through the streets first became slow and tedious,\r\nand was finally completely arrested, the whole lot of them having\r\ncome to a stand-still, and remaining rooted on the spot in one of\r\nthe much frequented thoroughfares of the city. The Pallis put on more\r\nmen to draw the cars, and even employed elephants and horses to haul\r\nthem, but all to no purpose. As if even this was not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy their malignity, the unscrupulous Seniyars actually went to\r\nKing Salivahana, and bitterly complained against the Pallis of having\r\ncaused a public nuisance by leaving their cars in a common highway to\r\nthe detriment of the public traffic. The king summoned the Pallis,\r\nand called them to account, but they pleaded that it was through no\r\nfault of theirs that the cars had stuck in a thoroughfare, that they\r\nhad not been negligent, but had essayed all possible methods of hauling\r\nthem to their destination by adding to the number of men employed in\r\npulling them, and by having further tried to accelerate their progress\r\nwith the aid of elephants, camels, and horses, but all in vain. They\r\nfurther declared their conviction that the Seniyars had played them an\r\nill-turn, and placed the cars under a spell. King Salivahana, however,\r\nturned a deaf ear to these representations, and decreed that it was\r\nopen to the Pallis to counteract the spells of their adversaries,\r\nand he prescribed a period within which this was to be effected. He\r\nalso tacked on a threat that, in default of compliance with his\r\nmandate, the Pallis must leave his kingdom for good and ever. The\r\nPallis sought refuge and protection of the goddess Kamakshi Amman,\r\nwhose pity was touched by their sad plight, and who came to their\r\naid. She appeared to one of the elders of the caste in a dream, and\r\nrevealed to him that there was a staunch devotee of hers--a member of\r\ntheir caste--who alone could remove the spells wrought by the Seniyars,\r\nand that this man, Ramasawmy Naikan, was Prime Minister in the service\r\nof the Kodagu (Coorg) Raja. The desperate plight they were in induced\r\nthe Pallis to send a powerful deputation to the Raja, and to beg of\r\nhim to lend them the services of Ramasawmy Naik, in order to save them\r\nfrom the catastrophe which was imminent. The Raja was kind enough to\r\ncomply. The Naik arrived, and, by virtue of his clairvoyant powers,\r\ntook in the situation at a glance. He found myriads of imps and uncanny\r\nbeings around each of the car-wheels, who gripped them as by a vice,\r\nand pulled them back with their sinewy legs and hands every time an\r\nattempt was made to drag them forwards. Ramasawmy Naik by no means\r\nliked the look of things, for he found that he had all his work cut\r\nout for him to keep these little devils from doing him bodily harm,\r\nlet alone any attempt to cast them off by spells. He saw that more\r\nthan common powers were needed to face the situation, and prayed to\r\nKamakshi Amman to disclose a way of overcoming the enemy. After long\r\nfasting and prayers, he slept a night in the temple of Kamakshi Amman,\r\nin the hope that a revelation might come to him in his slumber. While\r\nhe slept, Kamakshi Amman appeared, and declared to him that the only\r\nway of overcoming the foe was for the Pallis to render a propitiatory\r\nsacrifice, but of a most revolting kind, namely, to offer up as a\r\nvictim a woman pregnant with her first child. The Pallis trembled at\r\nthe enormity of the demand, and declared that they would sooner submit\r\nto Salivahana's decree of perpetual exile than offer such a horrible\r\nsacrifice. Ramasawmy Naik, however, rose to the occasion, and resolved\r\nto sacrifice his own girl-wife, who was then pregnant with her first\r\nchild. He succeeded in propitiating the deity by offering this heroic\r\nsacrifice, and the spells of the Seniyars instantly collapsed, and\r\nthe whole legion of imps and devils, who had impeded the progress of\r\nthe Pallis' car, vanished into thin air. The coast having thus been\r\ncleared of hostile influences, Ramasawmy Naik, with no more help than\r\nhis own occult powers gave him, succeeded in hauling the whole lot\r\nof cars to their destination, and in a single trip, by means of a\r\nrope passed through a hole in his nose. The Pallis, whose gratitude\r\nknew no bounds, called down benedictions on his head, and, falling\r\nprostrate before him, begged him to name his reward for the priceless\r\nservice rendered by him to their community. Ramasawmy Naik only asked\r\nthat the memory of his services to the caste might be perpetuated by\r\nthe bestowal upon him and his descendants of the title Jati-pillay,\r\nor children of the caste, and of the privilege of receiving alms at\r\nthe hands of the Pallis; and that they might henceforth be allowed the\r\nhonour of carrying the badges of the caste--banners, state umbrellas,\r\ntrumpets, and other paraphernalia--in proof of the signal victory\r\nthey had gained over the Seniyars.\"\r\n\r\nPalli Dasari.--A name for Tamil-speaking Dasaris, as distinguished\r\nfrom Telugu-speaking Dasaris.\r\n\r\nPalli Idiga.--A name given by Telugu people to Tamil Shanans, whose\r\noccupation is, like that of Idigas, toddy-drawing.\r\n\r\nPallicchan.--A sub-division of Nayars, the hereditary occupation\r\nof which is palanquin-bearing. In the Cochin Census Report, the\r\nPallicchans are recorded as being palanquin-bearers for Brahmans.\r\n\r\nPallikkillam.--An exogamous sept or illam of Tamil Panikkans.\r\n\r\nPalua.--A sub-division of Badhoyi.\r\n\r\nPambaikkaran.--An occupational name for Paraiyans, who play on a drum\r\ncalled pambai.\r\n\r\nPambala.--The Pambalas, or drum (pamba) people, are Malas who act\r\nas musicians at Mala marriages and festivals in honour of their\r\ndeities. They also take part in the recitation of the story of Ankamma,\r\nand making muggu (designs on the floor) at the peddadinamu death\r\nceremony of the Gamallas.\r\n\r\nPammi (a common lamp).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nPamula (snake people).--A name for snake-charming Koravas, and Jogis,\r\nwho, in the character of itinerant showmen, exhibit snakes to the\r\npublic. The name also occurs as an exogamous sept of Mala and Yanadi.\r\n\r\nPanam (palmyra palm: Borassus flabellifer.)--A sub-division of\r\nShanan. It also occurs as a branch or kothu of Kondaiyamkotti Maravans.\r\n\r\nPanan.--The Tamil Panans are said, in the Census Report, 1901, to be\r\nalso called Mestris. They are \"tailors among Tamils in Madura and\r\nTinnevelly. They employ Brahmans and Vellalas as purohits. Though\r\nbarbers and washermen will not eat food prepared by them, they are\r\nallowed to enter Hindu temples.\" The Malayalam Panans are described\r\nin the same report as \"exorcists and devil-dancers. The men also\r\nmake umbrellas, and the women act as midwives. In parts they are\r\ncalled Malayans, and they may be descendants of that hill tribe who\r\nhave settled in the plains.\" In the South Canara Manual, the Panans\r\nare said to be \"the Malayalam caste corresponding to the Nalkes and\r\nPombadas. They are numerous in Malabar, where they are also known by\r\nthe name of Malayan. The devils whom they personify are supposed to\r\nhave influence over crops, and at the time of harvest the Panans go\r\nabout begging from house to house, dancing with umbrellas in their\r\nhands. On such occasions, however, it is only boys and girls who\r\npersonify the demons.\" \"The village magician or conjurer,\" Mr. Gopal\r\nPanikkar writes, [26] \"goes by different names, such as Panan, Malayan,\r\netc. His work consists in casting out petty devils from the bodies of\r\npersons (chiefly children) possessed, in writing charms for them to\r\nwear, removing the pernicious effects of the evil eye, and so on.\" On\r\ncertain ceremonial occasions, the Panan plays on an hour-glass shaped\r\ndrum, called thudi.\r\n\r\nIn an account of the funeral ceremonies of the Tiyans, Mr. Logan\r\nwrites [27] that \"early on the morning of the third day after death,\r\nthe Kurup or caste barber adopts measures to entice the spirit of\r\nthe deceased out of the room in which he breathed his last. This is\r\ndone by the nearest relative bringing into the room a steaming pot\r\nof savoury funeral rice. It is immediately removed, and the spirit,\r\nafter three days' fasting, is understood greedily to follow the odour\r\nof the tempting food. The Kurup at once closes the door, and shuts out\r\nthe spirit. The Kurup belongs to the Panan caste. He is the barber of\r\nthe polluting classes above Cherumans, and by profession he is also\r\nan umbrella maker. But, curiously enough, though an umbrella maker, he\r\ncannot make the whole of an umbrella. He may only make the framework;\r\nthe covering of it is the portion of the females of his caste. If\r\nhe has no female relative of his own capable of finishing off his\r\numbrellas, he must seek the services of the females of other families\r\nin the neighbourhood to finish his for him. The basket-makers are\r\ncalled Kavaras. Nothing will induce them to take hold of an umbrella,\r\nas they have a motto, Do not take hold of Panan's leg.\"\r\n\r\nIn an account of a ceremonial at the Pishari temple near Quilandy in\r\nMalabar, Mr. F. Fawcett writes [28] that \"early on the seventh and last\r\nday, when the morning procession is over, there comes to the temple a\r\nman of the Panan caste. He carries a small cadjan (palm leaf) umbrella\r\nwhich he has made himself, adorned all round the edges with a fringe\r\nof the young leaves of the cocoanut palm. The umbrella should have a\r\nlong handle, and with this in his hand he performs a dance before the\r\ntemple. He receives about 10 lbs. of raw rice for his performance.\" It\r\nis further recorded by Mr. Fawcett that, when a Tiyan is cremated, a\r\nwatch is kept at the burning-ground for five days by Panans, who beat\r\ndrums all night to scare away the evil spirits which haunt such spots.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the Panans is given in the Gazetteer of\r\nMalabar. \"The name is perhaps connected with pan, music. They follow\r\nthe makkattayam family system (of inheritance from father to son),\r\nand practice fraternal polyandry. In South Malabar there are said to\r\nbe four sub-divisions, called Tirurengan, Kodaketti (umbrella tying),\r\nMinpidi (fish catching), and Pulluvan, of which the last named is\r\ninferior in status to the other three. They are also divided into\r\nexogamous illams or kiriyams. They worship Kali, and inferior deities\r\nsuch as Parakutti, Karinkutti, Gulikan, and Kutti Chattan. Their\r\nmethods of exorcism are various. If any one is considered to be\r\npossessed by demons, it is usual, after consulting the astrologer,\r\nto ascertain what Murti (lit. form) is causing the trouble, to call\r\nin Panans, who perform a ceremony called Teyattam, in which they\r\nwear masks, and, so attired, sing, dance, tom-tom, and play on rude\r\nand strident pipes. Other of their ceremonies for driving out devils\r\ncalled Ucchaveli seem to be survivals of imitations of human sacrifice,\r\nor instances of sympathetic magic. One of these consists of a mock\r\nliving burial of the principal performer, who is placed in a pit\r\nwhich is covered with planks, on the top of which a sacrifice (homam)\r\nis performed with a fire kindled with jack (Artocarpus integrifolia)\r\nbranches. In another variety, the Panan cuts his left forearm, and\r\nsmears his face with the blood thus drawn. Panans also take part\r\nwith Mannans in various ceremonies at Badrakali and other temples, in\r\nwhich the performers personate, in suitable costumes, some of the minor\r\ndeities or demons, and fowls are sacrificed, while a Velicchapad dances\r\nhimself into a frenzy, and pronounces oracles.\" It is further noted,\r\nin the Gazetteer of Malabar, that \"to constitute a valid divorce,\r\nthe husband pulls a thread from his cloth, and gives it to his wife's\r\nbrother, saying 'Your parisha is over.' It is a traditional duty\r\nof the Panans to furnish a messenger to announce to an Izhuvan (or\r\nTandan) girl's mother or husband (according to where she is staying)\r\nthat she has attained puberty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1901, Anjuttan (men of the five hundred) and\r\nMunnuttan (men of the three hundred) are returned as sub-castes of\r\nthe Malayalan Panans.\r\n\r\nFor the following account of the Panans of Travancore, I am indebted\r\nto Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The word is of Tamil origin, and means\r\na tailor. The title taken by them is Panikkan, the usual honorific\r\nappellation of most of the industrial castes of Malabar. They are\r\nsupposed to be one with the Panans of the Tamil country, though much\r\nbelow them in the social scale. They observe a pollution distance\r\nof thirty-six feet, but keep Mannans and Vedans at a distance of\r\neight, and Pulayas and Paraiyas at a distance of thirty-two feet from\r\nthem. They are their own barbers and washermen. They will eat food\r\nprepared by Kammalans, of whom there is a tradition that they are a\r\ndegraded branch. Tiruvarangan, one of the popular sages of Malabar,\r\nwho are reputed to be the descendants of a Paraiya woman, is said\r\nto have been a Panan, and the Panans pay him due reverence. In the\r\nKeralolpatti, the traditional occupation of the Panans is said to be\r\nexorcism, and in British Malabar this occupation seems to be continued\r\nat the present day. Umbrella-making is a secondary occupation for\r\nthe men. In Travancore, however, the only occupation pursued by the\r\nPanans is tailoring. The tali-kettu celebration takes place before\r\nthe girl attains puberty. If this ceremony is intended to signify\r\na real marriage, the girl is taken to her husband's house on the\r\nfourth day of the first menstrual period, and they remain thenceforth\r\nman and wife. Otherwise a sambandham ceremony has to be performed\r\neither by the tali-tier or some one else, to establish conjugal\r\nrelations. Inheritance is mostly paternal. The dead are buried,\r\nand death pollution lasts for sixteen days. The spirits of deceased\r\nancestors are appeased once a year by the offering of cooked food on\r\nthe new-moon day in the month of Karkatakam (July-August). Ancestors\r\nwho died from some untoward accident are propitiated in the month of\r\nAvani (August-September) by offerings of flesh and liquor. The latter\r\nceremonial is termed vellamkuli or water drinking. Small earthen sheds,\r\ncalled gurusalas or kuriyalas and matams, are erected in memory of\r\nsome ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the Panans of the Cochin State is extracted\r\nfrom a note by Mr. L. K. Ananta Krishna Aiyar. [29]\r\n\r\n\"The Panans give, as the traditional account of their origin, a\r\ndistorted version of the tradition as to the origin of the Izhuvans,\r\nwhich is found in the Mackenzie Manuscripts. The Panan version of the\r\nstory is as follows. One day a washerman of Cheraman Perumal chanced\r\nto wash his dress very clean. On being asked by the Perumal as to the\r\ncause of it, the washerman said that it was due to the suggestion of\r\na handsome carpenter girl, who saw him while washing. The Perumal,\r\npleased with the girl, desired her to be married to his washerman. The\r\nparents of the girl were duly consulted, and they could not refuse\r\nthe offer, as it came from their sovereign. But his fellow carpenters\r\nresented it, for, if the proposal was accepted, and the marriage\r\ncelebrated, it might not only place the members of her family under\r\na ban, but would also bring dishonour to the castemen. To avert the\r\ncontemplated union, they resorted to the following device. A pandal\r\n(marriage booth) was erected and tastefully decorated. Just at the\r\nauspicious hour, when the bridegroom and his party were properly\r\nseated on mats in the pandal, the carpenters brought a puppet exactly\r\nresembling the bride, and placed it by his side, when suddenly, by a\r\nclever artifice, the carpenters caused the building to tumble down,\r\nand thereby killed all those who were in it. They immediately left\r\nthe Perumal's country, and took refuge in the island of Ceylon. The\r\nruler was much embarrassed by the disaster to the washerman, and by\r\nthe flight of the carpenters, for he had none in his country to build\r\nhouses. A few Panans were sent for, and they brought the carpenters\r\nback. On their return, they were given some fruit of the palmyra\r\npalm, which they ate. They sowed the seeds in their own places,\r\nand these grew into large fruit-bearing palms. The Panans possessed\r\nthe privilege of keeping these trees as their own, but subsequently\r\nmade them over to the Izhuvans, who, in memory of this, give even\r\nto-day two dishes of food to the Panans on all ceremonial occasions in\r\ntheir houses. They have been, on that account, called by the Izhuvans\r\nnettaries, for their having originally planted these trees.\r\n\r\n\"There are no titles among the Panans, but one, who was brought for\r\nexamination at Trichur, told me that one of his ancestors got the\r\ntitle of Panikkan, and that he had the privilege of wearing a gold\r\near-ring, carrying a walking-stick lined with silver, and using\r\na knife provided with a style. Kapradan is a title given to the\r\nheadman in the Palghat taluk. In Palghat, when the Kapradan dies,\r\nthe Raja is informed, and he sends to the chief mourner (the son)\r\na sword, a shield, a spear, a few small guns with some gunpowder,\r\na silver bangle, and a few necklaces. As the dead body is taken to\r\nthe burial ground, the chief mourner, wearing the ornaments above\r\nmentioned, goes behind it. In front go a few persons armed with the\r\nweapons referred to. Three discharges are made (1) when the dead body\r\nis removed from the house, (2) when it is placed on the ground, (3)\r\nwhen it is burnt. The next day, the chief mourner pays his respects\r\nto the Raja, with an umbrella of his own making, when the Raja bestows\r\nupon him the title of Kapradan.\r\n\r\n\"There are magicians and sorcerers among the Panans, who sometimes,\r\nat the request even of the high-caste men, practice the black\r\nart. Some of the Panans, like the Parayans, engage in magical\r\nrites of a repulsive nature, in order to become possessors of a\r\npowerful medicine, the possession of which is believed to confer\r\nthe power of obtaining anything he wishes. They also believe in\r\nthe existence of a demoniacal hierarchy. Changili Karuppan, Pechi,\r\nOodara Karuppan, Kali, Chotala Karuppan, Chotala Bhadrakali, Yakshi,\r\nGandharvan, and Hanuman are the names of the chief demons whom they\r\nprofess to control with the aid of mantrams (consecrated formulæ)\r\nand offerings. They also profess that they can send one or more of\r\nthese demons into the bodies of men, and cast them out when persons\r\nare possessed of them. They profess to cure all kinds of diseases in\r\nchildren with the aid of magic and medicines, and all the castemen\r\nbelieve that harm or even death may be caused to men with the aid of\r\nsorcerers. In such cases, an astrologer is consulted, and, according\r\nto his calculations, the aid of a magician is sought for. When a\r\nperson is suffering from what are believed to be demoniacal attacks,\r\nhe is relieved by the performance of the following ceremony, called\r\npathalahomam. A pit about six feet in length, three feet in depth,\r\nand a foot or two in breadth, is dug. A Panan, covered with a new\r\npiece of cloth, is made to lie in the pit, which is filled in with\r\nearth, leaving a small hole for him to breathe. Over the middle of\r\nhis body, the earth is raised and made level. A sacred fire (homam)\r\nis made over this with the branches of a jack tree. Near it a large\r\nsquare is drawn with sixty-four small divisions, in each of which\r\na small leaf, with some paddy (unhusked rice), rice, flour, and\r\nlighted torches, is placed. Gingelly (Sesamum) seeds, mustard seeds,\r\ngrains of chama (Panicum miliaceum), horse gram (Dolichos biflorus),\r\neight fragrant things, the skin of snakes, dung of the elephant,\r\nmilk of the pala tree, twigs of the banyan tree, dharba grass, nila\r\nnarakam (Naregamia alata) oil, and ghee (clarified butter) are put\r\ninto it until it burns bright. The sick man is brought in front of\r\nit, and the sorcerer authoritatively asks him--or rather the demon\r\nresiding in his body--to take these things. The sorcerer puts the\r\nabove mentioned substances into the fire, muttering all the while\r\nhis mantrams invoking the favour of Vira Bhadra or Kandakaruna. The\r\nsignificance of these is 'Oh! Kandakaruna, the King of the Devas,\r\nI have no body, that is, my body is getting weaker and weaker, and\r\nam possessed of some demon, which is killing me, kindly help me, and\r\ngive me strength.' This done, another operation is begun. A fowl is\r\nburied, and a small portion of the earth above it is raised and made\r\nlevel. The figure of a man is drawn by the side of it. Three homams\r\n(sacred fires) are raised, one at the head, one in the middle, and\r\none at the feet. The above mentioned grains, and other substances,\r\nare put into the fire. A large square with sixty-four smaller squares\r\nin it is drawn, in each of which a leaf, with grains of paddy, rice,\r\nand flowers, is placed. Another mantram in praise of the demons already\r\nmentioned is uttered, and a song is sung. After finishing this, a\r\nsmall structure in the form of a temple is made. A small plantain tree\r\nis placed by the side of it. A padmam is drawn, and a puja (worship)\r\nis performed for the Paradevatha, the queen of demons. The sorcerer\r\nmakes offerings of toddy, beaten rice, plantains, and cocoanuts, and\r\nsoon turns oracle, and, as one inspired, tells what the deity wishes,\r\nand gives information as regards the departure of the demons from the\r\nbody. It is now believed that the patient is free from all demoniacal\r\nattacks. The buried man is exhumed, and allowed to go home.\r\n\r\n\"In the Palghat taluk, the following form of sorcery is practiced,\r\nwhich is believed to relieve persons from demoniacal attacks and\r\ndisease. If, in the house of any casteman, it is suspected that some\r\nmalign influence is being exercised by demons, a Panan is sent for,\r\nwho comes in the evening with his colleagues. A homam is lighted with\r\nthe branches of the trees already mentioned, and into it are thrown\r\nsix kinds of grains, as well as oil and ghee. As this is being done,\r\nKallatikode Nili, the presiding archdemon, is propitiated with songs\r\nand offerings. The next part of the ceremony consists in bringing\r\na bier and placing a Panan on it, and a measure of rice is placed\r\nat his head. He is, as in the case of a dead body, covered with a\r\npiece of new cloth, and a small plantain tree is placed between the\r\nthighs. At his head a sheep and at his feet a fowl are killed. He\r\npretends gradually to recover consciousness. In this state he is\r\ntaken outside the compound. The Panan, lying on the bier, evidently\r\npretends to be dead, as if killed by the attack of some demon. The\r\npropitiation with songs and offerings is intended to gratify the\r\ndemons. This is an instance of sympathetic magic.\r\n\r\n\"Some among the Panans practice the oti (or odi) cult, like\r\nthe Parayas. The following medicines, with the aid of magic,\r\nare serviceable to them in enticing pregnant women from their\r\nhouses. Their preparation is described as follows. A Panan, who is\r\nan adept in the black art, bathes early in the morning, dresses in a\r\ncloth unwashed, and performs puja to his deity, after which he goes\r\nin search of a Kotuveli plant (Manihot utilissima). When he finds\r\nsuch a one as he wants, he goes round it three times every day,\r\nand continues to do so for ninety days, prostrating himself every\r\nday before it. On the last night, which must be a new-moon night, at\r\ntwelve o'clock he performs puja to the plant, burning camphor, and,\r\nafter going round it three times, prostrates himself before it. He\r\nthen places three small torches on it, and advances twenty paces in\r\nfront of it. With his mouth closed, and without any fear, he plucks\r\nthe plant by the root, and buries it in the ashes on the cremation\r\nground, on which he pours the water of seven green cocoanuts. He\r\nthen goes round it twenty-one times, muttering all the while certain\r\nmantrams, after which he plunges himself in the water, and stands\r\nerect until it extends to his mouth. He takes a mouthful of water,\r\nwhich he empties on the spot, and then takes the plant with the root,\r\nwhich he believes to possess peculiar virtues. When it is taken to the\r\nclosed door of a house, it has the power to entice a pregnant woman,\r\nwhen the foetus is removed (cf. article Parayan). It is all secretly\r\ndone on a dark midnight. The head, hands and legs are cut off, and\r\nthe trunk is taken to a dark-coloured rock, on which it is cut into\r\nnine pieces, which are all burned until they are blackened. At this\r\nstage, one piece boils, and is placed in a new earthen pot, with the\r\naddition of the water of nine green cocoanuts. The pot is removed\r\nto the burial-ground. The Panan performs a puja here in favour of\r\nhis favourite deity. Here he fixes two poles deep in the earth,\r\nat a distance of thirty feet from each other.\r\n\r\nThe poles are connected by a strong wire, from which is suspended\r\nthe pot to be heated and boiled. Seven fire-places are made, beneath\r\nthe wire. The branches of bamboo, katalati (Achyranthes Emblica),\r\nconga (Bauhinea variegata), cocoanut palm, jack tree (Artocarpus\r\nintegrifolia), and pavatta (Pavatta indica), are used in forming a\r\nbright fire. The mixture in the pot soon boils and becomes oily, at\r\nwhich stage it is passed through a fine cloth. The oil is preserved,\r\nand a mark made with it on the forehead enables the possessor to\r\nrealise anything that is thought of. The sorcerer must be in a state\r\nof vow for twenty-one days, and live on a diet of chama kanji. The\r\ndeity, whose aid is necessary, is propitiated with offerings.\r\n\r\n\"One of the ceremonies which the Panans perform is called Thukil\r\nOnarthuka (waking thukil, a kind of drum). In the month of Karkadakam\r\n(July-August), a Panan, with his wife, provided with a drum and\r\nkuzhithalam (circular bell-metal cymbals), goes to the houses of\r\nBrahmans and Nayars after midnight, and sings sacred songs. During the\r\nweek, they sing standing underneath a banyan tree near the western\r\ngate of the Trichur temple. From the temple authorities they get\r\nfive measures of paddy, half a measure of rice, some gingelly oil,\r\nand a cocoanut. For their services in other houses, they receive a\r\nsimilar remuneration. This is intended to drive evil spirits, if any,\r\nfrom houses. Another of their festivals is known as Panan Kali. The\r\ntraditional account therefor is as follows. Once, when a Panan and\r\nhis wife went to a forest to bring bamboos for the manufacture of\r\numbrellas, they missed their way, night approached, and they could not\r\nreturn. They began to be frightened by the varieties of noise heard\r\nby them in the wilderness. They collected pieces of dry bamboo and\r\nleaves of trees, and burned them. In the presence of the light thus\r\nobtained, the woman caught hold of a creeper hanging from a tree,\r\nand danced in honour of Bhagavathi, while her husband sang songs\r\npraising her. The day dawned at last, and they found their way home\r\nin safety. In memory of this incident, the Panans organise a party\r\nfor a regular play. There are ten male and two female actors, and\r\nthe play is acted during the whole night.\r\n\r\n\"The religion of the Panans consists of an all-pervading\r\ndemonology. Their chief gods are Mukkan, Chathan, Kappiri,\r\nMalankorathi, and Kali. Pujas are performed to them on the first of\r\nMedom (April-May), Karkadakam (July-August), Desara, and on Tuesday\r\nin Makaram (January-February). These deities are represented by stones\r\nplaced under a tree. They are washed with water on the aforesaid days,\r\nand offerings of sheep and fowls, malar (parched rice), plantains,\r\ncocoanuts, and boiled rice are made to them. Their belief is that\r\nthese deities are ever prone to do harm to them, and should therefore\r\nbe propitiated with offerings. The Panans also worship the spirits\r\nof their ancestors, who pass for their household gods, and whose\r\nhelp they seek in all times of danger. They fast on new-moon nights,\r\nand on the eleventh night after full-moon or new-moon.\r\n\r\n\"The Panan is the barber of the polluting castes above Cherumans. By\r\nprofession he is an umbrella-maker. Panans are also engaged in all\r\nkinds of agricultural work. In villages, they build mud walls. Their\r\nwomen act as midwives.\r\n\r\n\"As regards social status, the Panans eat at the hands of Brahmans,\r\nNayars, Kammalans, and Izhuvans. They have to stand at a distance of\r\nthirty-two feet from Brahmans. Panans and Kaniyans pollute one another\r\nif they touch, and both bathe should they happen to do so. They are\r\ntheir own barbers and washermen. They live in the vicinity of the\r\nIzhuvans, but cannot live in the Nayar tharas. Nor can they take water\r\nfrom the wells of the Kammalans. They cannot approach the outer walls\r\nof Brahman temples, and are not allowed to enter the Brahman streets\r\nin Palghat.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1891, Panan occurs as a sub-division of the\r\nParaiyans. Their chief occupation as leather-workers is said to be\r\nthe manufacture of drum-heads. [30]\r\n\r\nPanasa.--The Panasas are a class of beggars in the Telugu country,\r\nwho are said to ask alms only from Kamsalas. The word panasa means\r\nconstant repetition of words, and, in its application to the Panasa,\r\nprobably indicates that they, like the Bhatrazu bards and panegyrists,\r\nmake up verses eulogising those from whom they beg. It is stated in the\r\nKurnool Manual (1886) that \"they take alms from the Beri Komatis and\r\ngoldsmiths (Kamsalas), and no others. The story goes that, in Golkonda,\r\na tribe of Komatis named Bacheluvaru were imprisoned for non-payment\r\nof arrears of revenue. Finding certain men of the artificer class who\r\npassed by in the street spit betel nut, they got it into their mouths,\r\nand begged the artificers to get them released. The artificers,\r\npitying them, paid the arrears, and procured their release. It was\r\nthen that the Kamsalis fixed a vartana or annual house-fee for the\r\nmaintenance of the Panasa class, on condition that they should not\r\nbeg alms from the other castes.\" The Panasas appear every year in\r\nthe Kurnool district to collect their dues.\r\n\r\nPancha.--Pancha, meaning five, is recorded as a sub-division of the\r\nLinga Balijas, and Panchachara or Panchamsale as a sub-division of\r\nLingayats. In all these, pancha has reference to the five acharas\r\nor ceremonial observances of the Lingayats, which seem to vary\r\naccording to locality. Wearing the lingam, worshipping it before\r\nmeals, and paying reverence to the Jangam priests, are included among\r\nthe observances.\r\n\r\nPanchala.--A synonym for Canarese Kammalans, among whom five (panch)\r\nclasses of workers are included, viz., gold and silver, brass and\r\ncopper, iron, and stone.\r\n\r\nPanchalinga (five lingams).--An exogamous sept of Boya. The lingam\r\nis the symbol of Siva.\r\n\r\nPanchama.--The Panchamas are, in the Madras Census Report, 1871, summed\r\nup as being \"that great division of the people, spoken of by themselves\r\nas the fifth caste, and described by Buchanan and other writers as\r\nthe Pancham Bandam.\" According to Buchanan, [31] the Pancham Bandum\r\n\"consist of four tribes, the Parriar, the Baluan, the Shekliar, and\r\nthe Toti.\" Buchanan further makes mention of Panchama Banijigaru and\r\nPanchama Cumbharu (potters). The Panchamas were, in the Department\r\nof Public Instruction, called \"Paraiyas and kindred classes\" till\r\n1893. This classification was replaced, for convenience of reference,\r\nby Panchama, which included Chacchadis, Godaris, Pulayas, Holeyas,\r\nMadigas, Malas, Pallans, Paraiyans, Totis, and Valluvans. \"It is,\"\r\nthe Director of Public Instruction wrote in 1902, \"for Government\r\nto consider whether the various classes concerned should, for the\r\nsake of brevity, be described by one simple name. The terms Paraiya,\r\nlow caste, outcaste, carry with them a derogatory meaning, and are\r\nunsuitable. The expression Pancham Banda, or more briefly Panchama,\r\nseems more appropriate.\" The Government ruled that there is no\r\nobjection to the proposal that Paraiyas and kindred classes should\r\nbe designated Panchama Bandham or Panchama in future, but it would\r\nbe simpler to style them the fifth class.\r\n\r\nThe following educational privileges according to the various classes\r\nclassified as Panchama may be noted:--\r\n\r\n(1) They are admitted into schools at half the standard rates of fees.\r\n\r\n(2) Under the result grant system (recently abolished), grants were\r\npassed for Panchama pupils at rates 50 per cent. higher than in\r\nordinary cases, and 15 per cent. higher in backward localities.\r\n\r\n(3) Panchama schools were exempted from the attendance restriction,\r\ni.e., grants were given to them, however small the attendance. Ordinary\r\nschools had to have an attendance of ten at least to earn grants.\r\n\r\n(4) Panchama students under training as teachers get stipends at\r\nrates nearly double of those for ordinary Hindus.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the system of education at the Olcott\r\nPanchama Free Schools has been written by Mrs. Courtright. [32]\r\n\r\nPanchama is returned, in the Census Reports, 1891 and 1901, as a\r\nsub-division of Balija and Banajiga.\r\n\r\nPancharamkatti.--A sub-division of Idaiyan, which derives its name\r\nfrom the neck ornament (pancharam) worn by the women.\r\n\r\nPandamuttu.--A sub-division of Palli. The name is made by Winslow to\r\nmean a number of torches arranged so as to represent an elephant. The\r\nPallis, however, explain it as referring to the pile of pots, which\r\nreaches to the top of the marriage pandal (pandal, booth, mutti,\r\ntouching). The lowest pot is decorated with figures of elephants\r\nand horses.\r\n\r\nPandaram.--Pandaram is described by Mr. H. A. Stuart [33] as being\r\n\"the name rather of an occupation than a caste, and used to denote\r\nany non-Brahmanical priest. The Pandarams seem to receive numerous\r\nrecruits from the Saivite Sudra castes, who choose to make a profession\r\nof piety, and wander about begging. They are in reality very lax\r\nin their modes of life, often drinking liquor and eating animal\r\nfood furnished by any respectable Sudra. They often serve in Siva\r\ntemples, where they make garlands of flowers to decorate the lingam,\r\nand blow brazen trumpets when offerings are made, or processions take\r\nplace. Tirutanni is one of the chief places, in which they congregate.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Trichinopoly district, that\r\n\"the water for the god's bath at Ratnagiri is brought by a caste of\r\nnon-Brahmans known as Tirumanjana Pandarams, who fetch it every day\r\nfrom the Cauvery. They say that they are descended from an Aryan king,\r\nwho came to the god with the hope of getting rubies from him. The god,\r\nin the guise of a Brahman, tested his devotion by making him fill a\r\nmagic vessel with Cauvery water. The vessel would not fill, and the\r\nAryan stranger in a fit of anger cut off the Brahman's head. The dead\r\nbody at once turned into a lingam, and the Aryan was ordered to carry\r\nwater for the temple till eternity.\"\r\n\r\nPandaram is used both as the name of a caste, and of a class composed\r\nof recruits from various castes (e.g., Vellala and Palli). The\r\nPandaram caste is composed of respectable people who have settled\r\ndown as land-holders, and of Sanyasis and priests of certain matams\r\n(religious institutions), and managers of richly endowed temples, such\r\nas those at Tiruvadudurai in Tanjore and Mailam in South Arcot. The\r\ncommon name for these managers is Tambiran. The caste Pandarams are\r\nstaunch Saivites and strict vegetarians. Those who lead a celibate\r\nlife wear the lingam. They are said to have been originally Sozhia\r\nVellalas, with whom intermarriage still takes place. They are initiated\r\ninto the Saivite religion by a rite called Dhikshai, which is divided\r\ninto five stages, viz., Samaya, Nirvana, Visesha, Kalasothanai, and\r\nAcharya Abhishekam. Some are temple servants, and supply flowers for\r\nthe god, while others sing devaram (hymns to the god) during the temple\r\nservice. On this account, they are known as Meikaval (body-guard of\r\nthe god), and Oduvar (reader). The caste Pandarams have two divisions,\r\ncalled Abhisheka and Desikar, and the latter name is often taken as\r\na title, e.g., Kandasami Desikar. An Abhisheka Pandaram is one who\r\nis made to pass through some ceremonies connected with Saiva Agama.\r\n\r\nThe mendicant Pandarams, who are recruited from various classes,\r\nwear the lingam, and do not abstain from eating flesh. Many villages\r\nhave a Pandaram as the priest of the shrine of the village deity,\r\nwho is frequently a Palli who has become a Pandaram by donning the\r\nlingam. The females are said to live, in some cases, by prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe Lingayat Pandarams differ in many respects from the true\r\nLingayats. The latter respect their Jangam, and use the sacred\r\nwater, in which the feet of the Jangam are washed, for washing their\r\nstone lingam. To the Pandarams, and Tamil Lingayats in general, this\r\nproceeding would amount to sacrilege of the worst type. Canarese and\r\nTelugu Lingayats regard a Jangam as superior to the stone lingam. In\r\nthe matter of pollution ceremonies the Tamil Lingayats are very\r\nparticular, whereas the orthodox Lingayats observe no pollution. The\r\ninvestiture with the lingam does not take place so early among the\r\nTamil as among the Canarese Lingayats.\r\n\r\nFor the following note, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana\r\nRao. \"Dr. H. H. Wilson [34] is of opinion that the word Pandaram is\r\n'more properly Panduranga, pale complexioned, from their smearing\r\nthemselves with ashes. It is so used in Hemachandra's history\r\nof Mahavira, when speaking of the Saiva Brahmans.' A more popular\r\nderivation of the name is from Bandaram, a public treasury. A good many\r\nwell-to-do Pandarams are managers of Siva temples in Southern India,\r\nand accordingly have the temple treasuries under their care. It is,\r\nhowever, possible that the name has been acquired by the caste by\r\nreason of their keeping a yellow powder, called pandaram, in a little\r\nbox, and giving it in return for the alms which they receive.\r\n\r\nOpinions are divided as to whether the Pandarams are Lingayats or\r\nnot. The opinion held by F. W. Ellis, the well-known Tamil scholar and\r\ntranslator of the Kural of Tiruvalluvar, is thus summarised by Colonel\r\nWilks. [35] \"Mr. Ellis considers the Jangam of the upper countries, and\r\nthe Pandaram of the lower, to be of the same sect, and both deny in the\r\nmost unequivocal terms the doctrine of the metempsychosis. A manuscript\r\nin the Mackenzie collection ascribes the origin of the Pandarams as\r\na sacerdotal order of the servile caste to the religious disputes,\r\nwhich terminated in the suppression of the Jain religion in the Pandian\r\n(Madura) kingdom, and the influence which they attained by the aid\r\nwhich they rendered to the Brahmans in that controversy, but this\r\norigin seems to require confirmation. In a large portion, perhaps in\r\nthe whole of the Brahmanical temples dedicated to Siva in the provinces\r\nof Arcot, Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Madura and Tinnevelly, the Pandaram\r\nis the highest of the temple, and has the entire direction of the\r\nrevenues, but allows the Brahmans to officiate in the ceremonial part\r\naccording to their own good pleasure, as a concern altogether below\r\nhis note. He has generally the reputation of an irreproachable life,\r\nand is treated by the Brahmans of the temple with great reverence,\r\nwhile on his part he looks with compassion at the absurd trifles\r\nwhich occupy their attention. These facts seem to point to some former\r\nrevolution, in which a Jangam government obtained a superiority over\r\nthe Brahmanical establishments, and adopted this mode of superseding\r\nthe substantial part of their authority. It is a curious instance\r\nof the Sooder (Sudra) being the spiritual lord of the Brahman, and\r\nis worthy of further historical investigation.\" Dr. Wilson [36] also\r\nthinks that the Pandarams are Lingayats. Mr. H. A. Stuart [37] says\r\nthat they are a class of priests who serve the non-Brahman castes. They\r\nhave returned 115 sub-divisions, of which only two are sufficiently\r\nlarge to require mention, Andi of Tinnevelly and Malabar, and Lingadari\r\nof Chingleput and Tinnevelly. Andi is a quasi-caste of beggars\r\nrecruited from all castes, and the Lingadari Pandarams are the same as\r\nJangams. Pandaram is, in fact, a class name rather than the name of a\r\ncaste, and it consists of priests and beggars. Mr. C. P. Brown [38]\r\nthinks that the Pandarams are not Lingayats. 'The Saiva worshippers\r\namong the Tamils are called Pandarams: these are not Vira Saivas,\r\nnor do they wear the linga or adore Basava. I name them here chiefly\r\nbecause they are often mentioned as being Vira Saivas, whereas in\r\ntruth they are (like the Smartas) Purva Saivas, and worship the image\r\nof Siva in their houses.' It must be remarked that Mr. Brown appears\r\nto have had a confused idea of Pandarams. Pandarams wear the linga\r\non their bodies in one of the usual modes, are priests to others\r\nprofessing the Lingayat religion, and are fed by them on funeral and\r\nother ceremonial occasions. At the same time, it must be added that\r\nthey are--more especially the begging sections--very lax as regards\r\ntheir food and drink. This characteristic distinguishes them from the\r\nmore orthodox Lingayats. Moreover, Lingayats remarry their widows,\r\nwhereas the Pandarams, as a caste, will not.\r\n\r\n\"Pandarams speak Tamil. They are of two classes, the married and\r\ncelibate. The former are far more numerous than the latter, and dress\r\nin the usual Hindu manner. They have the hind-lock of hair known as the\r\nkudumi, put on sacred ashes, and paint the point between the eyebrows\r\nwith a sandal paste dot. The celibates wear orange-tawny cloths,\r\nand daub sacred ashes all over their bodies. They allow the hair\r\nof the head to become matted. They wear sandals with iron spikes,\r\nand carry in their hands an iron trisulam (the emblem of Siva),\r\nand a wooden baton called dandayudha (another emblem of Siva). When\r\nthey go about the streets, they sing popular Tamil hymns, and beat\r\nagainst their begging bowl an iron chain tied by a hole to one of\r\nits sides. Married men also beg, but only use a bell-metal gong\r\nand a wooden mallet. Most of these help pilgrims going to the more\r\nfamous Siva temples in the Madras Presidency, e.g., Tirutani, Palni,\r\nTiruvannamalai, or Tirupparankunram. Among both sections, the dead are\r\nburied in the sitting posture, as among other Lingayats. A samadhi\r\nis erected over the spot where they are buried. This consists of a\r\nlinga and bull in miniature, which are worshipped as often as may be\r\nfound convenient.\r\n\r\n\"The managers of temples and mutts (religious institutions), known\r\nas Pandara Sannadhis, belong to the celibate class. They are usually\r\nlearned in the Agamas and Puranas. A good many of them are Tamil\r\nscholars, and well versed in Saiva Siddhanta philosophy. They call\r\nthemselves Tambirans--a title which is often usurped by the uneducated\r\nbeggars.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1901, Vairavi is returned as a sub-caste of\r\nPandaram, and said to be found only in the Tinnevelly district, where\r\nthey are measurers of grains and pujaris in village temples. Vairavi\r\nis further used as a name for members of the Melakkaran caste, who\r\nofficiate as servants at the temples of the Nattukottai Chettis.\r\n\r\nPandaram is a title of the Panisavans and Valluvan priests of the\r\nParaiyans.\r\n\r\nA class of people called hill Pandarams are described [39] by the\r\nRev. S. Mateer as \"miserable beings without clothing, implements,\r\nor huts of any kind, living in holes, rocks, or trees. They bring\r\nwax, ivory (tusks), and other produce to the Arayans, and get salt\r\nfrom them. They dig roots, snare the ibex (wild goat, Hemitragus\r\nhylocrius) of the hills, and jungle fowls, eat rats and snakes, and\r\neven crocodiles found in the pools among the hill streams. They were\r\nperfectly naked and filthy, and very timid. They spoke Malayalam in a\r\ncurious tone, and said that twenty-two of their party had been devoured\r\nby tigers within two monsoons.\" Concerning these hill Pandarams,\r\nMr. N. Subramani Aiyar writes that they live on the banks of streams\r\nin crevices of rocks, caves, and hollows of trees. They are known to\r\nthe dwellers on the plains as Kattumanushyar, or forest men. They clad\r\nthemselves in the bark of trees, and, in the rainy and cold seasons,\r\nprotect their bodies with plantain leaves. They speak a corrupt form of\r\nTamil. They fear the sight of other men, and try to avoid approaching\r\nthem. A former European magistrate of the Cardamom Hills took some\r\nof them to his residence, but, during their three days' stay there,\r\nthey refused to eat or talk. There is a chieftain for every four hills,\r\nbut his authority is little more than nominal. When women are married,\r\nthe earth and hills are invoked as witnesses. They have Hindu names,\r\nsuch as Raman, Kittan (Krishna), and Govindan.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture delivered some years ago at Trivandrum, Mr. O. H. Bensley\r\ndescribed the hill Pandarams as being \"skilful in catching fish,\r\ntheir mode of cooking which is to place the fish on roots on a rock,\r\nand cover them with fire. They keep dogs, and, by their aid, replenish\r\ntheir larder with rats, mungooses, iguanas (lizard, Varanus), and\r\nother delicacies. I was told that the authority recognised by these\r\npeople is the head Arayan, to whom they give a yearly offering of\r\njungle produce, receiving in exchange the scanty clothing required\r\nby them. We had an opportunity of examining their stock-in-trade,\r\nwhich consisted of a bill-hook similar to those used by other hillmen,\r\na few earthen cooking-pots, and a good stock of white flour, which\r\nwas, they said, obtained from the bark of a tree, the name of which\r\nsounded like ahlum. They were all small in stature, with the exception\r\nof one young woman, and, both in appearance and intelligence, compared\r\nfavourably with the Uralis.\"\r\n\r\nPandariyar.--Pandariyar or Pandarattar, denoting custodians of\r\nthe treasury, has been returned as a title of Nattaman, Malaiman,\r\nand Sudarman.\r\n\r\nPandava-kulam.--A title, indicative \"of the caste of the Pandava\r\nkings,\" assumed by Jatapus and Konda Doras, who worship the\r\nPandavas. The Pandava kings were the heroes of the Mahabharata, who\r\nfought a great battle with the Kauravas, and are said to have belonged\r\nto the lunar race of Kshatriyas. The Pandavas had a single wife named\r\nDraupadi, whom the Pallis or Vanniyans worship, and celebrate annually\r\nin her honour a fire-walking festival. The Pallis claim to belong to\r\nthe fire race of Kshatriyas, and style themselves Agnikula Kshatriyas,\r\nor Vannikula Kshatriyas.\r\n\r\nPandi (pig).--Recorded as an exogamous sept of Asili, Boya, and\r\nGamalla. Pandipattu (pig catchers) and Pandikottu (pig killers)\r\noccur as exogamous septs of Odde.\r\n\r\nPandito.--Pandit or Pundit (pandita, a learned man) has been defined\r\n[40] as \"properly a man learned in Sanskrit lore. The Pundit of the\r\nSupreme Court was a Hindu law-officer, whose duty it was to advise\r\nthe English Judges when needful on questions of Hindu law. The office\r\nbecame extinct on the constitution of the High Court (in 1862). In the\r\nMahratta and Telugu countries, the word Pandit is usually pronounced\r\nPant (in English colloquial Punt).\" In the countries noted, Pant\r\noccurs widely as a title of Brahmans, who are also referred to\r\nas Pantulu varu. The titles Sanskrit Pundit, Telugu Pundit, etc.,\r\nare still officially recognised at several colleges in the Madras\r\nPresidency. Pandit sometimes occurs as an honorific prefix, e.g.,\r\nPandit S. M. Natesa Sastri, and Panditan is a name given to Tamil\r\nbarbers (Ambattan). In some parts of the Tamil country, Panditar is\r\nused as a name for Madhva Brahmans, because, it is said, many of them\r\nwere formerly engaged as pandits at the Law Courts.\r\n\r\nPandito is further the name of \"an Oriya caste of astrologers and\r\nphysicians. They wear the sacred thread, and accept drinking water\r\nonly from Brahmans and Gaudos. Infant marriage is practiced, and widow\r\nmarriage is prohibited.\" [41] I am informed that these Panditos engage\r\nBrahmans for their ceremonials, do not drink liquor, and eat fish and\r\nmutton, but not fowls or beef. The females wear glass bangles. They\r\nare known by the name of Khodikaro, from khodi, a kind of stone,\r\nwith which they write figures on the floor, when making astrological\r\ncalculations. The stone is said to be something like soapstone.\r\n\r\nPandita occurs as an exogamous sept of Stanikas.\r\n\r\nPandya.--The territorial name Pandya, Pandiya, Pandiyan, or Pandi\r\nhas been returned, at recent times of census, as a sub-division of\r\nvarious Tamil classes, e.g., Ambattan, Kammalan, Occhan, Pallan,\r\nVannan, and Vellala. Pandiya is further a title of some Shanans. In\r\nTravancore, Pandi has been returned by some Izhavans. The variant\r\nPandiangal occurs as an exogamous sept of the Tamil Vallambans,\r\nand Pandu as a Tamil synonym for Kapu or Reddi.\r\n\r\nPanikkar.--Panikkar, meaning teacher or worker, has been recorded,\r\nin the Malayalam country, as a title of barbers, Kammalan, Maran,\r\nNayar, Panan, and Paraiyan. In former times, the name was applied,\r\nin Malabar, to fencing-masters, as the following quotations show :--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1518. \"And there are very skilful men who teach this art (fencing),\r\n    and they are called Panicars.\"--Barbosa.\r\n\r\n    1553. \"And when the Naire comes to the age of 7 years, he is\r\n    obliged to go to the fencing-school, the master of which (whom\r\n    they call Panical) they regard as a father, on account of the\r\n    instruction he gives them.\"--Barros.\r\n\r\n    1583. \"The maisters which teach them be graduates in the\r\n    weapons which they teach, and they be called in their language\r\n    Panycaes.\"--Castaneda.\r\n\r\n\r\nA class of people called Panikkan are settled in the Madura and\r\nTinnevelly districts. Some of them are barbers to Shanans. Others have\r\ntaken to weaving as a profession, and will not intermarry with those\r\nwho are employed as barbers. \"The Panikkans are,\" Mr. Francis writes,\r\n[42] \"weavers, agriculturists, and traders. They employ Brahmans as\r\npriests, but these are apparently not received on terms of equality\r\nby other Brahmans. The Panikkans now frequently call themselves Illam\r\nVellalas, and change their title in deeds and official papers from\r\nPanikkan to Pillai. They are also taking to wearing the sacred thread\r\nand giving up eating meat. The caste is divided into three vagais or\r\nendogamous classes, namely, Mital, Pattanam, and Malayalam, and each\r\nof these again has five partly exogamous septs or illams (families),\r\nnamely, Muttillam, Toranattillam, Pallikkillam, Manjanattillam, and\r\nSoliya-illam. It is stated that the Mital and Pattanam sections will\r\neat together though they do not intermarry, but that the Malayalam\r\nsection can neither dine with nor marry into the other two. They are\r\nreported to have an elaborate system of caste government, under which\r\neleven villages form a gadistalam (or stage), and send representatives\r\nto its council to settle caste matters; and eleven gadistalams form\r\na nadu (or country), and send representatives to a chief council,\r\nwhich decides questions which are beyond the competence of the\r\ngadistalams.\" The occurrence of Malayam as the name of a sub-division,\r\nand of the Malayalam word illam as that of the exogamous septs, would\r\nseem to indicate that the Panikkans are immigrants from the westward\r\ninto the Tamil country.\r\n\r\nPanimagan (work children).--A name for Mukkuvans who are employed as\r\nbarbers for members of their caste.\r\n\r\nPanisavan.--Panisavan is defined in the Salem Manual as \"a corruption\r\nof paniseygiravan (panisaivon), literally meaning one who works (or\r\ndoes service), and is the caste name of the class, whose business it\r\nis to carry news of death to the relations of the deceased, and to\r\nblow the tharai or long trumpet.\" According to Mr. H. A. Stuart, [43]\r\nPanisavan appears to answer among the Tamilians to the Dasaris or Tadas\r\nof the Telugus. It is a mendicant caste, worshipping Siva. Unlike the\r\nTadas, however, they often employ themselves in cultivation, and are,\r\non the whole, a more temperate and respectable class. Their priests\r\nare Brahmans, and they eat flesh, and drink alcoholic liquor very\r\nfreely. The dead are generally burned.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of Panisavans, of which one works for the\r\nright-hand section, and the other for the left. This division is purely\r\nprofessional, and there is apparently no bar to intermarriage between\r\nthe two classes. The insignia of a Panisavan are the conch-shell\r\n(Turbinella rapa) and tharai, which he supports from the ground by\r\nmeans of a bamboo pole while he blows it. At marriage processions,\r\nit is his duty to go in front, sounding the tharai from time to\r\ntime. On such occasions, and at festivals of the village goddesses,\r\nthe tharai is decorated with a string bearing a number of small\r\ntriangular pieces of cloth, and tufts of yak's hair. The cloth\r\nshould be white for the right-hand section, and of five different\r\ncolours for the left. At the present day, the Panisavan is more in\r\nrequest for funerals than for weddings. In the city of Madras, all\r\nthe materials necessary for the bier are sold by Panisavans, who also\r\nkeep palanquins for the conveyance of the corpse in stock, which are\r\nlet out on hire. At funerals, the Panisavan has to follow the corpse,\r\nblowing his conch-shell. The tharai is only used if the deceased was\r\nan important personage. When the son goes round the corpse with a pot\r\nof water, the Panisavan accompanies him, and blows the conch. On the\r\nlast day of the death ceremonies (karmandhiram), the Panisavan should\r\nbe present, and blow his conch, especially when the tali (marriage\r\nbadge) is removed from a widow's neck. In some places, the Panisavan\r\nconveys the news of death, while in others this duty is carried out by\r\na barber. In the Chingleput and North Arcot districts, the Panisavans\r\nconstitute a separate caste, and have no connection with the Nokkans,\r\nwho are beggars attached to the Palli or Vanniyan caste. In South\r\nArcot and Tanjore, on the other hand, the name Nokkan is used to\r\nsignify the caste, which performs the duties of the Panisavan, for\r\nwhich it seems to be a synonym. The Panisavans of the Tinnevelly\r\ndistrict have nothing in common with those of the northern districts,\r\ne.g., Chingleput and North Arcot, whose duty it is to attend to the\r\nfuneral ceremonies of the non-Brahman castes. The main occupations\r\nof the Tinnevelly Panisavans are playing in temples on the nagasaram\r\n(reed instrument), and teaching Deva-dasis dancing. Another occupation,\r\nwhich is peculiar to the Tinnevelly Panisavans, is achu velai, i.e.,\r\nthe preparation of the comb to which the warp threads of a weaving loom\r\nare tied. Socially the Panisavans occupy a lowly position, but they use\r\nthe title Pulavar. Their other titles are Pandaram, Pillai, and Mudali.\r\n\r\nPaniyan.--The Paniyans are a dark-skinned tribe, short in stature,\r\nwith broad noses, and curly or wavy hair, inhabiting the Wynad,\r\nand those portions of the Ernad, Calicut, Kurumbranad and Kottayam\r\ntaluks of Malabar, which skirt the base of the ghats, and the Mudanad,\r\nCherangod, and Namblakod amshams of the Nilgiri district.\r\n\r\nA common belief, based on their general appearance, prevails among\r\nthe European planting community that the Paniyans are of African\r\norigin, and descended from ancestors who were wrecked on the Malabar\r\ncoast. This theory, however, breaks down on investigation. Of their\r\norigin nothing definite is known. The Nayar Janmis (landlords)\r\nsay that, when surprised in the act of some mischief or alarmed,\r\nthe Paniyan calls out 'Ippi'! 'Ippi'! as he runs away, and they\r\nbelieve this to have been the name of the country whence they came\r\noriginally; but they are ignorant as to where Ippimala, as they\r\ncall it, is situated. Kapiri (Africa or the Cape?) is also sometimes\r\nsuggested as their original habitat, but only by those who have had\r\nthe remarks of Europeans communicated to them. The Paniyan himself,\r\nthough he occasionally puts forward one or other of the above places\r\nas the home of his forefathers, has no fixed tradition bearing on\r\ntheir arrival in Malabar, beyond one to the effect that they were\r\nbrought from a far country, where they were found living by a Raja,\r\nwho captured them, and carried them off in such a miserable condition\r\nthat a man and his wife only possessed one cloth between them, and\r\nwere so timid that it was only by means of hunting nets that they\r\nwere captured.\r\n\r\nThe number of Paniyans, returned at the census, 1891, was 33,282,\r\nand nine sub-divisions were registered; but, as Mr. H. A. Stuart,\r\nthe Census Commissioner, observes:--\"Most of these are not real, and\r\nnone has been returned by any considerable number of persons.\" Their\r\nposition is said to be very little removed from that of a slave,\r\nfor every Paniyan is some landlord's 'man'; and, though he is, of\r\ncourse, free to leave his master, he is at once traced, and good care\r\nis taken that he does not get employment elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the fifties of the last century, when planters first began to settle\r\nin the Wynad, they purchased the land with the Paniyans living on it,\r\nwho were practically slaves of the land-owners. The Paniyans used\r\nformerly to be employed by rich receivers as professional coffee\r\nthieves, going out by night to strip the bushes of their berries,\r\nwhich were delivered to the receiver before morning. Unlike the\r\nBadagas of the Nilgiris, who are also coffee thieves, and are afraid\r\nto be out after dark, the Paniyans are not afraid of bogies by night,\r\nand would not hesitate to commit nocturnal depredations. My friend,\r\nMr. G. Romilly, on whose estate my investigation of the Paniyans was\r\nmainly carried out, assures me that, according to his experience,\r\nthe domesticated Paniyan, if well paid, is honest, and fit to be\r\nentrusted with the responsible duties of night watchman.\r\n\r\nIn some localities, where the Janmis have sold the bulk of their land,\r\nand have consequently ceased to find regular employment for them,\r\nthe Paniyans have taken kindly to working on coffee estates, but\r\ncomparatively few are thus employed. The word Paniyan means labourer,\r\nand they believe that their original occupation was agriculture as it\r\nis, for the most part, at the present day. Those, however, who earn\r\ntheir livelihood on estates, only cultivate rice and ragi (Eleusine\r\ncoracana) for their own cultivation; and women and children may be\r\nseen digging up jungle roots, or gathering pot-herbs for food. They\r\nwill not eat the flesh of jackals, snakes, vultures, lizards, rats,\r\nor other vermin. But I am told that they eat land-crabs, in lieu of\r\nexpensive lotions, to prevent baldness and grey hairs. They have a\r\ndistinct partiality for alcohol, and those who came to be measured\r\nby me were made more than happy by a present of a two-anna piece,\r\na cheroot, and a liberal allowance of undiluted fiery brandy from the\r\nMeppadi bazar. The women are naturally of a shy disposition, and used\r\nformerly to run away and hide at the sight of a European. They were\r\nat first afraid to come and see me, but confidence was subsequently\r\nestablished, and all the women came to visit me, some to go through the\r\nordeal of measurement, others to laugh at and make derisive comments\r\non those who were undergoing the operation.\r\n\r\nPractically the whole of the rice cultivation in the Wynad is carried\r\nout by the Paniyans attached to edoms (houses or places) or devasoms\r\n(temple property) of the great Nayar landlords; and Chettis and\r\nMappillas also frequently have a few Paniyans, whom they have bought\r\nor hired by the year at from four to eight rupees per family from a\r\nJanmi. When planting paddy or herding cattle, the Paniyan is seldom\r\nseen without the kontai or basket-work protection from the rain. This\r\ncurious, but most effective substitute for the umbrella-hat of the\r\nMalabar coast, is made of split reeds interwoven with 'arrow-root'\r\nleaves, and shaped something like a huge inverted coal-scoop turned\r\non end, and gives to the individual wearing it the appearance of a\r\ngigantic mushroom. From the nature of his daily occupation the Paniyan\r\nis often brought in contact with wild animals, and is generally a\r\nbold, and, if excited, as he usually is on an occasion such as the\r\nnetting of a tiger, a reckless fellow. The young men of the villages\r\nvie with each other in the zeal which they display in carrying out\r\nthe really dangerous work of cutting back the jungle to within a\r\ncouple of spear-lengths of the place where the quarry lies hidden,\r\nand often make a show of their indifference by turning and conversing\r\nwith their friends outside the net.\r\n\r\nYears ago it was not unusual for people to come long distance for the\r\npurpose of engaging Wynad Paniyans to help them in carrying out some\r\nmore than usually desperate robbery or murder. Their mode of procedure,\r\nwhen engaged in an enterprise of this sort, is evidenced by two cases,\r\nwhich had in them a strong element of savagery. On both these occasions\r\nthe thatched homesteads were surrounded at dead of night by gangs of\r\nPaniyans carrying large bundles of rice straw. After carefully piling\r\nup the straw on all sides of the building marked for destruction,\r\ntorches were, at a given signal, applied, and those of the wretched\r\ninmates who attempted to escape were knocked on the head with clubs,\r\nand thrust into the fiery furnace.\r\n\r\nThe Paniyans settle down happily on estates, living in a settlement\r\nconsisting of rows of huts and detached huts, single or double storied,\r\nbuilt of bamboo and thatched. During the hot weather, in the unhealthy\r\nmonths which precede the advent of the south-west monsoon, they shift\r\ntheir quarters to live near streams, or in other cool, shady spots,\r\nreturning to their head quarters when the rains set in.\r\n\r\nThey catch fish either by means of big flat bamboo mats, or, in a\r\nless orthodox manner, by damming a stream and poisoning the water\r\nwith herbs, bark, and fruit, which are beaten to a pulp and thrown\r\ninto the water. The fish, becoming stupified, float on the surface,\r\nand fall an easy and unfairly earned prey.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded by Mr. H. C. Wilson [44] that the section of the\r\nMoyar river \"stretching from the bottom of the Pykara falls down to\r\nthe sheer drop into the Mysore ditch below Teppakadu is occupied\r\nprincipally by Carnatic carp. In the upper reaches I found traces\r\nof small traps placed across side runners or ditches, which were\r\nthen dry. They had evidently been in use during the last floods, and\r\nallowed to remain. Constructed of wood in the shape of a large rake\r\nhead with long teeth close together, they are fastened securely across\r\nthe ditch or runner at a slight angle with teeth in the gravel. The\r\nobject is to catch the small fry which frequent these side places for\r\nprotection during flood times. Judging by their primitive nature and\r\npoor construction, they are not effective, but will do a certain amount\r\nof damage. The nearest hamlet to this place is called Torappalli,\r\noccupied by a few fisher people called Paniyans. These are no doubt\r\nthe makers of the traps, and, from information I received, they are\r\nsaid to possess better fry and other traps. They are also accredited\r\nwith having fine-mesh nets, which they use when the waters are low.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1907, rules were issued, under the Indian Fisheries Act, IV of 1897,\r\nfor the protection of fish in the Bhavani and Moyar rivers. These rules\r\nreferred to the erection and use of fixed engines, the construction\r\nof weirs, and the use of nets, the meshes of which are less than one\r\nand a half inches square for the capture or destruction of fish, and\r\nthe prohibition of fishing between the 15th March and 15th September\r\nannually. Notice of the rules was given by beat of tom-tom (drum)\r\nin the villages lying on the banks of the rivers, to which the rules\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nThe Paniyan language is a debased Malayalam patois spoken in a curious\r\nnasal sing-song, difficult to imitate; but most of the Paniyans\r\nemployed on estates can also converse in Kanarese.\r\n\r\nWholly uneducated and associating with no other tribes, the Paniyans\r\nhave only very crude ideas of religion. Believing in devils of all\r\nsorts and sizes, and professing to worship the Hindu divinities,\r\nthey reverence especially the god of the jungles, Kad Bhagavadi,\r\nor, according to another version, a deity called Kuli, a malignant\r\nand terrible being of neither sex, whose shrines take the form of a\r\nstone placed under a tree, or sometimes a cairn of stones. At their\r\nrude shrines they contribute as offerings to the swami (god) rice\r\nboiled in the husk, roasted and pounded, half-a-cocoanut, and small\r\ncoins. The banyan and a lofty tree, apparently of the fig tribe,\r\nare reverenced by them, inasmuch as evil spirits are reputed to\r\nhaunt them at times. Trees so haunted must not be touched, and,\r\nif the Paniyans attempt to cut them, they fall sick.\r\n\r\nSome Paniyans are believed to be gifted with the power of changing\r\nthemselves into animals; and there is a belief among the Paniyan\r\ndwellers in the plains that, if they wish to secure a woman whom\r\nthey lust after, one of the men gifted with this special power goes\r\nto her house at night with a hollow bamboo, and encircles the house\r\nthree times. The woman then comes out, and the man, changing himself\r\ninto a bull or dog, works his wicked will. The woman, it is believed,\r\ndies in the course of two or three days.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 some Paniyans were employed by a Mappilla (Muhammadan) to\r\nmurder his mistress, who was pregnant, and threatened that she would\r\nnoise abroad his responsibility for her condition. He brooded over\r\nthe matter, and one day, meeting a Paniyan, promised him ten rupees\r\nif he would kill the woman. The Paniyan agreed to commit the crime,\r\nand went with his brothers to a place on a hill, where the Mappilla\r\nand the woman were in the habit of gratifying their passions. Thither\r\nthe man and woman followed the Paniyans, of whom one ran out, and\r\nstruck his victim on the head with a chopper. She was then gagged\r\nwith a cloth, carried some distance, and killed. The two Paniyans\r\nand the Mappilla were sentenced to be hanged.\r\n\r\nMonogamy appears to be the general rule among the Paniyans, but there\r\nis no obstacle to a man taking unto himself as many wives as he can\r\nafford to support.\r\n\r\nApparently the bride is selected for a young man by his parents, and,\r\nin the same way that a wealthy European sometimes sends his betrothed\r\na daily present of a bouquet, the more humble Paniyan bridegroom-elect\r\nhas to take a bundle of firewood to the house of the fiancée every\r\nday for six months. The marriage ceremony (and the marriage knot\r\ndoes not appear to be very binding) is of a very simple nature. The\r\nceremony is conducted by a Paniyan Chemmi (a corruption of Janmi). A\r\npresent of sixteen fanams (coins) and some new cloths is given by the\r\nbridegroom to the Chemmi, who hands them over to the parents of the\r\nbride. A feast is prepared, at which the Paniyan women (Panichis)\r\ndance to the music of drum and pipe. The tali (or marriage badge)\r\nis tied round the neck of the bride by the female relations of the\r\nbridegroom, who also invest the bride with such crude jewelry as\r\nthey may be able to afford. The Chemmi seals the contract by pouring\r\nwater over the head and feet of the young couple. It is said [45]\r\nthat a husband has to make an annual present to his wife's parents;\r\nand failure to do so entitles them to demand their daughter back. A\r\nman may, I was told, not have two sisters as wives; nor may he marry\r\nhis deceased wife's sister. Remarriage of widows is permitted. Adultery\r\nand other forms of vice are adjudicated on by a panchayat (or council)\r\nof headmen, who settle disputes and decide on the fine or punishment\r\nto be inflicted on the guilty. At nearly every considerable Paniyan\r\nvillage there is a headman called Kuttan, who has been appointed by\r\nNayar Janmi to look after his interests, and be responsible to him for\r\nthe other inhabitants of the village. The investiture of the Kuttan\r\nwith the powers of office is celebrated with a feast and dance, at\r\nwhich a bangle is presented to the Kuttan as a badge of authority. Next\r\nin rank to the Kuttan is the Mudali or head of the family, and they\r\nusually constitute the panchayat. Both Kuttan and Mudali are called\r\nMuppanmar or elders. The whole caste is sometimes loosely spoken of\r\nas Muppan. In a case of proved adultery, a fine of sixteen fanams\r\n(the amount of the marriage fee), and a sum equal to the expenses\r\nof the wedding, including the present to the parents of the bride,\r\nis the usual form of punishment.\r\n\r\nThe Chemmi or Shemmi is, I am informed, a sort of priest or\r\nminister. He was appointed, in olden days, by the chieftains under whom\r\nthe Paniyans worked, and each Chemmi held authority over a group of\r\nvillages. The office is hereditary, but, should a Chemmi family fail,\r\nit can be filled up by election.\r\n\r\nNo ceremony takes place in celebration of the birth of children. One\r\nof the old women of the village acts as midwife, and receives a small\r\npresent in return for her services. As soon as a child is old enough\r\nto be of use, it accompanies its parents to their work, or on their\r\nfishing and hunting expeditions, and is initiated into the various\r\nways of adding to the stock of provisions for the household.\r\n\r\nThe dead are buried in the following manner. A trench, four or five\r\nfeet deep, and large enough to receive the body to be interred, is\r\ndug, due north and south, on a hill near the village. At the bottom\r\nof this excavation the earth is scooped out from the western side on\r\na level with the floor throughout the length of the grave, so as to\r\nform a receptacle for the corpse, which, placed on a mat, is laid\r\ntherein upon its left side with the head pointing to the south and\r\nthe feet to the north. After a little cooked rice has been put into\r\nthe grave for the use of the departed spirit, the mat, which has been\r\nmade broad enough for the purpose, is folded up and tucked in under\r\nthe roof of the cavity, and the trench filled up. It has probably\r\nbeen found by experience that the corpse, when thus protected,\r\nis safe from the ravages of scavenger jackals and pariah dogs. For\r\nseven days after death, a little rice gruel is placed at distance\r\nof from fifty to a hundred yards from the grave by the Chemmi, who\r\nclaps his hands as a signal to the evil spirits in the vicinity, who,\r\nin the shape of a pair of crows, are supposed to partake of the food,\r\nwhich is hence called kaka conji or crow's rice.\r\n\r\nThe noombu or mourning ceremonies are the ti polay, seven days after\r\ndeath; the kaka polay or karuvelli held for three years in succession\r\nin the month of Magaram (January-February); and the matham polay\r\nheld once in every three or four years, when possible, as a memorial\r\nservice in honour of those who are specially respected. On all these\r\noccasions the Chemmi presides, and acts as a sort of master of the\r\nceremonies. As the ceremonial carried out differs only in degree,\r\nan account of the kaka polay will do for all.\r\n\r\nIn the month of Magaram, the noombukarrans or mourners (who have lost\r\nrelatives) begin to cook and eat in a pandal or shed set apart from\r\nthe rest of the village, but otherwise go about their business as\r\nusual. They wash and eat twice a day, but abstain from eating meat or\r\nfish. On the last day of the month, arrangements are made, under the\r\nsupervision of the Chemmi, for the ceremony which brings the period\r\nof mourning to a close. The mourners, who have fasted since daybreak,\r\ntake up their position in the pandal, and the Chemmi, holding on his\r\ncrossed arms two winnowing sieves, each containing a seer or two of\r\nrice, walks round three times, and finally deposits the sieves in the\r\ncentre of the pandal. If, among the male relatives of the deceased, one\r\nis to be found sufficiently hysterical, or actor enough, to simulate\r\npossession and perform the functions of an oracle, well and good; but,\r\nshould they all be of a stolid temperament, there is always at hand\r\na professional corresponding to the Komaran or Vellichipad of other\r\nHindus. This individual is called the Patalykaran. With a new cloth\r\n(mundu) on his head, and smeared on the body and arms with a paste\r\nmade of rice flour and ghi (clarified butter), he enters on the scene\r\nwith his legs girt with bells, the music of which is supposed to drive\r\naway the attendant evil spirits (payanmar). Advancing with short steps\r\nand rolling his eyes, he staggers to and fro, sawing the air with two\r\nsmall sticks which he holds in either hand, and works himself up into\r\na frenzied state of inspiration, while the mourners cry out and ask\r\nwhy the dead have been taken away from them. Presently a convulsive\r\nshiver attacks the performer, who staggers more violently and falls\r\nprostrate on the ground, or seeks the support of one of the posts\r\nof the pandal, while he gasps out disjointed sentences, which are\r\ntaken to be the words of the god. The mourners now make obeisance,\r\nand are marked on the forehead with the paste of rice flour and\r\nghi. This done, a mat is spread for the accommodation of the headmen\r\nand Chemmi; and the Patalykaran, from whose legs the bells have been\r\nremoved and put with the rice in the sieves, takes these in his hands,\r\nand, shaking them as he speaks, commences a funeral chant, which lasts\r\ntill dawn. Meanwhile food has been prepared for all present except the\r\nmourners, and when this has been partaken of, dancing is kept up round\r\nthe central group till daybreak, when the pandal is pulled down and\r\nthe kaka polay is over. Those who have been precluded from eating make\r\nup for lost time, and relatives, who have allowed their hair to grow\r\nlong, shave. The ordinary Paniyan does not profess to know the meaning\r\nof the funeral orations, but contents himself with a belief that it\r\nis known to those who are initiated. The women attend the ceremony,\r\nbut do not take part in the dance. In fact, the nearest approach to\r\na dance that they ever attempt (and this only on festive occasions)\r\nresembles the ordinary occupation of planting rice, carried out in\r\ndumb show to the music of a drum. The bodies of the performers stoop\r\nand move in time with the music, and the arms are swung from side to\r\nside as in the act of placing the rice seedlings in their rows. To see\r\na long line of Paniyan women, up to their knees in the mud of a rice\r\nfield, bobbing up and down and putting on the pace as the music grows\r\nquicker and quicker, and to hear the wild yells of Hou! Hou! like\r\na chorus of hungry dogs, which form the vocal accompaniment as they\r\ndab the green bunches in from side to side, is highly amusing.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account of the Paniyan death ceremonies was supplied\r\nby Mr. Colin Mackenzie, to whom, as also to Mr. F. Fawcett,\r\nMr. G. Romilly, and Martelli, I am indebted for many of the facts\r\nrecorded in the present note. From Mr. Fawcett the following account\r\nof a further ceremony was obtained:--\r\n\r\nAt a Paniyan village, on a coffee estate where the annual ceremony\r\nwas being celebrated, men and boys were dancing round a wooden\r\nupright to the music of a small drum hanging at the left hip. Some\r\nof the dancers had bells round the leg below the knee. Close to the\r\nupright a man was seated, playing a pipe, which emitted sounds like\r\nthose of a bagpipe. In dancing, the dancers went round against the\r\nsun. At some little distance a crowd of females indulged in a dance\r\nby themselves. A characteristic of the dance, specially noticeable\r\namong the women, was stooping and waving of the arms in front. The\r\ndancers perspired freely, and kept up the dance for many hours to\r\nrhythmic music, the tune of which changed from time to time. There\r\nwere three chief dancers, of whom one represented the goddess, the\r\nothers her ministers. They were smeared with streaks on the chest,\r\nabdomen, arms and legs, had bells on the legs, and carried a short\r\nstick about two feet in length in each hand. The sticks were held\r\nover the head, while the performers quivered as if in a religious\r\nfrenzy. Now and again, the sticks were waved or beaten together. The\r\nPaniyans believe that, when the goddess first appeared to them, she\r\ncarried two sticks in her hands. The mock goddess and her attendants,\r\nholding the sticks above the head and shivering, went to each male\r\nelder, and apparently received his blessing, the elder placing his\r\nhand on their faces as a form of salutation, and then applying his\r\nhand to his own face. The villagers partook of a light meal in the\r\nearly morning, and would not eat again until the end of the ceremony,\r\nwhich concluded by the man-goddess seating himself on the upright,\r\nand addressing the crowd on behalf of the goddess concerning their\r\nconduct and morality.\r\n\r\nThe Paniyans \"worship animistic deities, of which the chief is Kuli,\r\nwhom they worship on a raised platform called Kulitara, offering\r\ncocoanuts, but no blood.\" [46] They further worship Kattu Bhagavati,\r\nor Bhagavati of the woods. \"Shrines in her honour are to be found at\r\nmost centres of the caste, and contain no image, but a box in which\r\nare kept the clothing and jewels presented to her by the devout. An\r\nannual ceremony lasting a week is held in her honour, at which the\r\nKomaran and a kind of priest, called Nolambukaran, take the chief\r\nparts. The former dresses in the goddess' clothing, and the divine\r\nafflatus descends upon him, and he prophesies both good and evil.\"\r\n\r\nGames.--A long strip of cane is suspended from the branch of a tree,\r\nand a cross-bar fixed to its lower end. On the bar a boy sits, and\r\nswings himself in all directions. In another game a bar, twelve\r\nto fourteen feet in length, is balanced by means of a point in a\r\nsocket on an upright reaching about four feet and-a-half above the\r\nground. Over the end of the horizontal bar a boy hangs, and, touching\r\nthe ground with the feet, spins himself round.\r\n\r\nSome Paniyans have a thread tied round the wrist, ankle, or neck,\r\nas a charm to ward off fever and other diseases. Some of the men have\r\nthe hair of the head hanging down in matted tails in performance of\r\na vow. The men wear brass, steel, and copper rings on their fingers\r\nand brass rings in the ears.\r\n\r\nThe women, in like manner, wear finger rings, and, in addition,\r\nbangles on the wrist, and have the lobes of the ears widely dilated,\r\nand plugged with cadjan (palm leaf) rolls. In some the nostril is\r\npierced, and plugged with wood.\r\n\r\nThe Paniyans, who dwell in settlements at the base of the ghats,\r\nmake fire by what is known as the Malay or sawing method. A piece\r\nof bamboo, about a foot in length, in which two nodes are included,\r\nis split longitudinally into two equal parts. On one half a sharp\r\nedge is cut with a knife. In the other a longitudinal slit is made\r\nthrough about two-thirds of its length, which is stuffed with a\r\npiece of cotton cloth. It is then held firmly on the ground with its\r\nconvex surface upwards, and the cutting edge drawn, with a gradually\r\nquickening sawing motion, rapidly to and fro across it by two men,\r\nuntil the cloth is ignited by the incandescent particles of wood in\r\nthe groove cut by the sharp edge. The cloth is then blown with the\r\nlips into a blaze, and the tobacco or cooking fire can be lighted.\r\n\r\nAt Pudupadi an elephant mahout was jealously guarding a bit of bamboo\r\nstick with notches cut in it, each notch representing a day for\r\nwhich wages were due to him. The stick in question had six notches,\r\nrepresenting six days' wages.\r\n\r\nAverage height 157.4 cm. Nasal index 95 (max. 108.6). The average\r\ndistance from the tip of the middle finger to the top of the patella\r\nwas 4.6 cm. relative to stature = 100, which approximates very closely\r\nto the recorded results of measurement of long-limbed African negroes.\r\n\r\nPanjai.--Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as a sub-division\r\nof Pandya Vellala. The name Panjai, indicating a poverty-stricken\r\nindividual, is usually applied to mendicant Pandarams.\r\n\r\nPanjaram.--Panjaram or Pancharamkatti is the name of a sub-division\r\nof the Idaiyans, derived from the peculiar gold ornament, which the\r\nwomen wear. It is said that, in this division, widow marriage is\r\ncommonly practiced, because Krishna used to place a similar ornament\r\nround the necks of Idaiyan widows of whom he became enamoured, and\r\nthat this sub-division was the result of his amours with them.\r\n\r\nPanjukkara (cotton-man).--An occupational name of a sub-division of\r\nVellalas, who are not at the present day connected with the cotton\r\ntrade. They call themselves Panjukkara Chettis. The equivalent panjari\r\n(pinjari) or Panjukotti occurs as a Tamil synonym for Dudekula\r\n(Muhammadan cotton-cleaners).\r\n\r\nPannadai (sheath of the cocoanut leaf).--A sub-division of Vettuvan.\r\n\r\nPannaiyan.--A title of Alavan.\r\n\r\nPannara.--A sub-division of Mali.\r\n\r\nPannendu Nal (twelve days).--A name for those Pallis who, like\r\nBrahmans, perform the final death ceremonies on the twelfth day.\r\n\r\nPannirendam (twelfth) Chetti.--A section of the Chettis.\r\n\r\nPano.--In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the Panos are described as\r\n\"a caste of weavers found in the Ganjam district. This caste is no\r\ndoubt identical with the Pans, a weaving, basket-making, and servile\r\ncaste of Orissa and Chota Nagpore. The Panos occupy the same position\r\namong the Khonds of Ganjam as the Dombs hold among the inhabitants\r\nof the Vizagapatam hills, and the words Pano and Dombo are generally\r\nregarded as synonyms [See Domb]. The members of the Sitra sub-division\r\nare workers in metal.\" It is further noted, in the Census Report, 1901,\r\nthat the Panos are \"an extensive caste of hill weavers found chiefly\r\nin the Ganjam Agency. The Khond synonym for this word is Domboloko,\r\nwhich helps to confirm the connection between this caste and the Dombas\r\nof Vizagapatam. They speak Khond and Oriya.\" In a note on the Panos, I\r\nread that \"their occupations are trading, weaving, and theft. They live\r\non the ignorance and superstition of the Khonds as brokers, pedlars,\r\nsycophants, and cheats. In those parts where there are no Oriyas,\r\nthey possess much influence, and are always consulted by the Khonds\r\nin questions of boundary disputes.\" In a brief account of the Panos,\r\nMr. C. F. MacCartie writes [47] that \"the Panos, also known by the\r\ntitle of Dombo or Sitra in some parts, are supposed to be Paraiya\r\n[Telugu Mala] emigrants from the low country. Their profession is\r\nweaving or brass work, the monotony of which they vary by petty\r\ntrading in horns, skins and live cattle, and occasionally enliven\r\nby house-breaking and theft at the expense of the Khonds, who have\r\nan incautious trick of leaving their habitations utterly unguarded\r\nwhen they go off to the hills to cultivate. [In the Madras Census\r\nReport, 1901, the Sitras are said to be supposed to be the progeny\r\nof a Khond man and a Haddi woman, who manufacture the brass rings\r\nand bangles worn by the Khonds.] The Panos are drunken, immoral,\r\nand dirty in their habits. The Khonds refuse to eat with them, but I\r\ndo not find that this objection extends to drinking, at which both\r\nKhond and Pano display surprising capabilities. Panos are also the\r\nprofessional musicians of the country, and attend weddings, deaths\r\nand sacrifices in this character, for which they are recompensed with\r\nfood, liquor, and cloths. The generality of Khond and Pano houses are\r\nconstructed of broad sâl (Shorea robusta) logs, hewn out with the axe\r\nand thatched with jungle grass, which is impervious to white-ants. In\r\nbamboo jungles, of course, bamboo is substituted for sâl. The Panos\r\ngenerally affect a detached quarter, known as Dombo sai. Intermarriage\r\nbetween Khonds, Panos, and Uriyas is not recognised, but cases do\r\noccur when a Pano induces a Khond woman to go off with him. She may\r\nlive with him as his wife, but no ceremony takes place. [A few years\r\nago, a young Khond was betrothed to the daughter of another Khond,\r\nand, after a few years, managed to pay up the necessary number of\r\ngifts. He then applied to the girl's father to name the day for the\r\nmarriage. Before the wedding took place however, a Pano went to the\r\ngirl's father, and said that she was his daughter (she had been born\r\nbefore her parents were married), and that he was the man to whom\r\nthe gifts should have been paid. The case was referred to a council,\r\nwhich decided in favour of the Pano.] If a Pano commits adultery\r\nwith a Khond married woman, he has to pay a paronjo, or a fine of\r\na buffalo to the husband (who retains his wife), and in addition\r\na goat, a pig, a basket of paddy (rice), a rupee, and a load of\r\npots. There is close communication between the Panos and the Khonds,\r\nas the former act as the advisers of the latter in all cases of doubt\r\nor difficulty. The Uriyas live apart from both, and mix but little\r\nwith either, except on the occasion of sacrifices or other solemn\r\nassemblages, when buffaloes are slaughtered for Panos and Khonds,\r\nand goats or sheep for Uriya visitors. [It is noted, in the Ganjam\r\nManual, in connection with Khond death ceremonies, that \"if a man\r\nhas been killed by a tiger, purification is made by the sacrifice\r\nof a pig, the head of which is cut off with a tangi (axe) by a Pano,\r\nand passed between the legs of the men in the village, who stand in a\r\nline astraddle. It is a bad omen to him, if the head touches any man's\r\nlegs.] Among the products of the jungles may be included myrabolams\r\n(Terminalia fruits), tasar silk cocoons, and dammer, all of which\r\nare bartered by the finders to trading Panos in small quantities,\r\ngenerally for salt.\" In the Ganjam Maliahs, the jungles are said to\r\nbe searched by Panos for tasar cocoons, and, just across the border\r\nin Boad, the collection of these cocoons is a regular industry among\r\nthem. Small portions of jungle are regularly reserved, and divided\r\nup into small allotments. Each of these is given to a Pano for rent,\r\nand here he cultivates the silkworms, and collects the silk, which\r\nis sent to Berhampur and Sambalpur for manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe Panos are divided into two distinct sections, viz., the Khonda\r\nPanos who live amidst the Khonds, and the Desa Panos of the plains. The\r\nformer have adopted some of the customs of the Khonds, while the\r\nlatter follow the customs of the Uriya castes which dwell in the\r\nlowland. The Khond Panos are governed by the Molikos (headmen) of the\r\nKhonds. In some cases, the fines inflicted for breach of caste rules\r\nare rather severe. For example, in the neighbourhood of Baliguda, a\r\nman who is convicted of adultery has to pay two rupees, and give two\r\nbuffaloes to the council which tries the case. Further south, for a\r\nsimilar offence twelve buffaloes are demanded, and the culprit has to\r\npay twice the amount of the bride-price to the injured husband. The\r\nDesa Panos conform to the standard Uriya type of caste council, and\r\nhave a headman called Behara, who is assisted by a Nayako, and caste\r\nservants entitled Bhollobaya or Gonjari.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremonies of the Desa Panos are closely allied to those\r\nof the Dandasis and Haddis, whereas those of the Khonda Panos bear a\r\nclose resemblance to the ceremonies of the Khonds. Like Khond girls,\r\nunmarried Khond Pano girls sleep in quarters (dhangadi) specially\r\nset apart for them, and, as among the Khonds, wedding presents in\r\nthe form of gontis are given. It is noted with reference to the\r\nKhonds, in the Ganjam Manual, that \"the bride is looked upon as a\r\ncommercial speculation, and is paid for in gontis. A gonti is one of\r\nanything, such as a buffalo, a pig, or a brass pot; for instance,\r\na hundred gontis might consist of ten bullocks, ten buffaloes, ten\r\nsacks of corn, ten sets of brass, twenty sheep, ten pigs, and thirty\r\nfowls.\" At a Khond Pano marriage, the fingers of the contracting\r\ncouple are linked together, and an important item of the ceremonial,\r\nwhich adds dignity thereto, is placing in front of the house at which\r\na marriage is being celebrated a big brass vessel containing water,\r\nwith which the guests wash their feet.\r\n\r\nThe Panos pay reverence to ancestors, to whom, when a death occurs\r\nin a family, food is offered. In some Pano villages, when a child is\r\nborn, it is customary to consult a pujari (priest) as to whether the\r\ngrandfather or great-grandfather is re-born in it. If the answer is\r\nin the affirmative, pigs are sacrificed to the ancestors. Some Panos\r\nhave adopted the worship of Takuranis (village deities), to whom rice\r\nand turmeric are offered by placing them before the image in the form\r\nof a figure-of-eight. A fowl is sacrificed, and its blood allowed to\r\nflow on to one loop of the figure. In some places, Dharmadevata and\r\nGagnasuni are worshipped, a castrated goat being sacrificed annually\r\nto the former, and fowls and an entire goat to the latter.\r\n\r\nPano women, who live among the Khonds, tattoo their faces in like\r\nmanner, and in other respects resemble Khond women.\r\n\r\nI am informed that, on more than one occasion, Panos have been known\r\nto rifle the grave of a European, in the belief that buried treasure\r\nwill be found.\r\n\r\nPanta (a crop).--A sub-division of Kapu and Yanadi. In the Gazetteer\r\nof South Arcot, Pan Reddi is recorded as a caste of Telugu-speaking\r\nryots (Kapus).\r\n\r\nPantala.--Recorded, in Travancore, as a sub-division of Samantan. The\r\nname is said to be derived from Bhandarattil, or belonging to the\r\nroyal treasury.\r\n\r\nPantari.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, as synonymous\r\nwith the Idacheri sub-division of Nayar. Pantrantu Vitan is also\r\nthere recorded as a sub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPappadam.--People calling themselves Pappadam Chetti are largely\r\nfound in Malabar, living by the manufacture and sale of cakes called\r\npappadam, which are purchased by all classes, including Nambutiri\r\nBrahmans.\r\n\r\nPappini.--A name for Brahmanis, a class of Ambalavasi.\r\n\r\nPappu (split pulse).--An exogamous sept of Balija.\r\n\r\nParadesi.--Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as a class of\r\nMalayalam beggars. The name indicates strangers (paradesa, a foreign\r\ncountry), and is applied to the White Jews of Cochin, in connection\r\nwith whom it occurs in Sirkar (State) accounts and royal writs granted\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nParaiya Tada.--Recorded, in the North Arcot Manual, as a name for\r\nthose who are considered impure Valluvans. The name literally means\r\nParaiya Tadan or Dasari.\r\n\r\nParaiyan.--The Paraiyans or, as they are commonly termed, Pariahs of\r\nthe Tamil country number, according to recent census returns, over two\r\nmillion souls, and a large proportion of those who returned themselves\r\nas Native Christians are said also to belong to this class. For the\r\nfollowing note I am mainly indebted to an account of the Paraiyans\r\nby the Rev. A. C. Clayton. [48]\r\n\r\nThe late Bishop Caldwell derived the name Paraiyan from the Tamil\r\nword parai a drum, as certain Paraiyans act as drummers at marriages,\r\nfunerals, village festivals, and on occasions when Government or\r\ncommercial announcements are proclaimed. Mr. H. A. Stuart, however,\r\nseems to question this derivation, remarking [49] that \"it is only\r\none section of Paraiyans that act as drummers. Nor is the occupation\r\nconfined to Paraiyans. It seems in the highest degree improbable that\r\na large, and at one time powerful, community should owe its name to\r\nan occasional occupation, which one of its divisions shares with other\r\ncastes. The word Paraiyan is not found in Divakaram, a Tamil dictionary\r\nof the eleventh century A.D., and the word Pulayan was then used to\r\ndenote this section of the population, as it is still in Malayalam to\r\nthis day.\" In the legend of the Saivite saint, Nandan is, in the prose\r\nversion of the Periya Puranam, called a Pulayan, though a native of\r\nSholamandalam, which was a distinctly Tamil kingdom. Mr. W. Francis\r\nwrites [50] that \"the old Tamil poems and works of the early centuries\r\nof the Christian era do not mention the name Paraiyan, but contain\r\nmany descriptions of a tribe called the Eyinas, who seem to have\r\nbeen quite distinct from the rest of the population, and did not\r\nlive in the villages, but in forts of their own. Ambur and Vellore\r\nare mentioned as the sites of two of these. They may perhaps have\r\nbeen the ancestors of the Paraiyans of to-day.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Paraiyans, Sonnerat, writing [51] in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, says that \"they are prohibited from drawing water from the\r\nwells of other castes; but have particular wells of their own near\r\ntheir inhabitations, round which they place the bones of animals,\r\nthat they may be known and avoided. When an Indian of any other caste\r\npermits a Paraiya to speak to him, this unfortunate being is obliged\r\nto hold his hand before his mouth, lest the Indian may be contaminated\r\nwith his breath; and, if he is met on the highway, he must turn on one\r\nside to let the other pass. If any Indian whatever, even a Choutre,\r\nby accident touches a Paraiya, he is obliged to purify himself in a\r\nbath. The Brahmans cannot behold them, and they are obliged to fly\r\nwhen they appear. Great care is taken not to eat anything dressed\r\nby a Paraiya, nor even to drink out of the vessel he has used; they\r\ndare not enter the house of an Indian of another caste; or, if they\r\nare employed in any work, a door is purposely made for them; but they\r\nmust work with their eyes on the ground; for, if it is perceived they\r\nhave glanced at the kitchen, all the utensils must be broken. The\r\ninfamy of the Paraiyas is reflected on the Europeans: last are held\r\nin more detestation, because, setting aside the little respect they\r\nhave for the cow, whose flesh they eat, the Indians reproach them with\r\nspitting in their houses, and even their temples: that when drinking\r\nthey put the cup to their lips, and their fingers to their mouths in\r\nsuch a manner that they are defiled with the spittle.\"\r\n\r\nParaiyans are to be found throughout the Tamil districts from North\r\nArcot to Tinnevelly, and in the southern extremity of the Native\r\nState of Travancore. In the Telugu country the Malas and Madigas and\r\nin the Canarese country the Holeyas take their place.\r\n\r\nSome of the most common names of Paraiyan males are--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kanni or Kanniyappan.\r\n    Raman or Ramaswami.\r\n    Raju.\r\n    Velu.\r\n    Muttan.\r\n    Mari.\r\n    Kanagan.\r\n    Subban.\r\n    Nondi.\r\n    Tambiran.\r\n    Perumal.\r\n    Viran.\r\n    Sellan.\r\n    Amavasi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong females the most common names are Tai, Parpathi, Ammai, Kanni,\r\nMuttammal, Rajammal, Ammani, Selli, Gangammal. In one village,\r\nwhere the Paraiyans were almost all Vaishnavas, by profession not by\r\npractice, Mr. Clayton found the inhabitants all named after heroes\r\nof the Mahabharata, and dirty naked children answered to the names\r\nof Ikshvakan, Karnan, Bhiman, and Draupadi. It is usual to give\r\nthe father's name when distinguishing one Paraiyan from another,\r\ne.g., Tamburan, son of Kannan. In legal documents the prefix Para\r\ndenotes a Paraiyan, e.g., Para Kanni, the Paraiyan Kanni, but this\r\nis a purely clerical formula. The Paraiyan delights in nicknames,\r\nand men sometimes grow so accustomed to these that they have almost\r\nforgotten their real names. The following nicknames are very common :--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nondi, lame.\r\n    Kallan, thief.\r\n    Kullan, dwarf.\r\n    Vellei, white or light complexioned.\r\n    Kannan, with eyes.\r\n    Muthalai, crocodile.\r\n    Kudiyan, drunkard.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo name, indicating virtue or merit, is given, lest the wrath of\r\nmalevolent spirits should be aroused.\r\n\r\nAt the census, 1891, 348 sub-divisions were returned, of which the\r\nfollowing were strongest in point of numbers :--Amma found chiefly\r\nin Tanjore and Madura; Katti in Salem and Trichinopoly; Kizhakkatti\r\n(eastern) in Salem; Koliyan (weavers) in Chingleput, Tanjore and\r\nTrichinopoly; Konga in Salem; Korava in Coimbatore; Kottai (fort) in\r\nSouth Arcot; Morasu (drum) in Salem; Mottai in Madura; Pacchai (green)\r\nin Coimbatore; Samban in South Arcot; Sangidum (sanku, conch, or chank\r\nshell) in Coimbatore; Sozhia (natives of the Sozha or Chola country)\r\nin Tanjore and Madura; Tangalan in North and South Arcot, Chingleput,\r\nSalem, and Trichinopoly; and Valangamattu in South Arcot. The members\r\nof the various sub-divisions do not intermarry.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me that the Morasu Paraiyans, included in\r\nthe above list, are Canarese Holeyas, who have settled in the Tamil\r\ncountry. In the south their women, like the Kallans, wear a horsehair\r\nthread round the neck. As additional sub-divisions, the following\r\nmay be noted :--\r\n\r\nAruththukattatha, or those who, having once cut the tali-string, do\r\nnot tie it a second time, i.e., those who do not permit remarriage\r\nof widows.\r\n\r\nValai (a net).--Paraiyans who hunt.\r\n\r\nSanku (conch-shell).--Those who act as conch-blowers at funerals.\r\n\r\nThatha.--Thathan is the name given to mendicants who profess\r\nVaishnavism. Such Paraiyans are Vaishnavites, and some are beggars.\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1901, Mr. Francis notes that the term Paraiyan\r\n\"is now almost a generic one, and the caste is split up into many\r\nsub-divisions, which differ in manners and ways. For example, the\r\nKoliyans, who are weavers, and the Valluvans, who are medicine men and\r\npriests and wear the sacred thread, will not intermarry or eat with\r\nthe others, and are now practically distinct castes.\" As occupational\r\ntitles of Paraiyans Mr. Francis gives Urumikkaran and Pambaikkaran,\r\nor those who play on drums (urumi and pambai), and Podarayan or Podara\r\nVannan, who are washermen. The title Valangamattan, or people of the\r\nright-hand division, is assumed by some Paraiyans.\r\n\r\nMr. Clayton states that he knows of no legend or popular belief\r\namong the Paraiyans, indicating that they believe themselves to\r\nhave come from any other part of the country than that where they\r\nnow find themselves. There is, however, some evidence that the\r\nrace has had a long past, and one in which they had independence,\r\nand possibly great importance in the peninsula. Mr. Stuart mentions\r\n[52] that the Valluvans were priests to the Pallava kings before the\r\nintroduction of the Brahmans, and even for some time after it. He\r\nquotes an unpublished Vatteluttu inscription, believed to be of the\r\nninth century, in which it is noted that \"Sri Valluvam Puvanavan,\r\nthe Uvacchan (or temple ministrant), will employ six men daily, and do\r\nthe temple service.\" The inference is that the Valluvan was a man of\r\nrecognised priestly rank, and of great influence. The prefix Sri is\r\na notable honorific. By itself this inscription would prove little,\r\nbut the whole legendary history of the greatest of all Tamil poets,\r\nTiruvalluvar, \"the holy Valluvan,\" confirms all that can be deduced\r\nfrom it. His date can only be fixed approximately, but it is probable\r\nthat he flourished not later than the tenth century A.D. It is safe\r\nto say that this extraordinary sage could not have attained the fame\r\nhe did, or have received the honours that were bestowed upon him, had\r\nnot the Valluvans, and therefore the Paraiyans, been in the circle\r\nof respectable society in his day. This conjecture is strengthened\r\nby the legend that he married a Vellala girl. The same hypothesis\r\nis the only one that will account for the education and the vogue of\r\nthe sister of the poet, the aphoristic poetess Avvei.\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1901, Mr. Francis mentions an inscription of\r\nthe Chola King Raja Raja, dated about the eleventh century A.D.,\r\nin which the Paraiyan caste is called by its own name. It had then\r\ntwo sub-divisions, the Nesavu or weavers, and Ulavu or ploughmen. The\r\ncaste had even then its own hamlets, wells and burning-grounds.\r\n\r\nThere are certain privileges possessed by Paraiyans, which they could\r\nnever have gained for themselves from orthodox Hinduism. They seem\r\nto be survivals of a past, in which Paraiyans held a much higher\r\nposition than they do now. It is noted by Mr. M. J. Walhouse [53]\r\nthat \"in the great festival of Siva at Trivalur in Tanjore the headman\r\nof the Pareyars is mounted on the elephant with the god, and carries\r\nhis chauri (yak-tail fly fan). In Madras, at the annual festival of\r\nEgatta, the goddess of the Black, [54] now George, Town, when a tali\r\nis tied round the neck of the idol in the name of the entire community,\r\na Pareyan is chosen to represent the bridegroom. At Melkotta in Mysore,\r\nthe chief seat of the followers of Ramanuja Acharya, and at the Brahman\r\ntemple at Belur, the Holeyas or Pareyars have the right of entering\r\nthe temple on three days in the year specially set apart for them.\" At\r\nMelkote, the Holeyas and Madigas are said to have been granted the\r\nprivilege of entering the sanctum sanctorum along with Brahmans and\r\nothers on three days by Ramanuja. In 1799, however, the right to\r\nenter the temple was stopped at the dhvajastambham, or consecrated\r\nmonolithic column. At both Belur and Melkote, as soon as the festival\r\nis over, the temples are ceremonially purified. At Sriperumbudur in\r\nthe Chingleput district, the Paraiyans enjoy a similar privilege to\r\nthose at Tiruvalur, in return for having sheltered an image of the\r\nlocally-worshipped incarnation of Vishnu during a Muhammadan raid. It\r\nis noted by Mr. Stuart that the lower village offices, the Vettiyan,\r\nTaliari, Dandasi or Barike, and the Toti, are, in the majority of\r\nMadras villages, held by persons of the Paraiyan caste. Paraiyans\r\nare allowed to take part in pulling the cars of the idols in the\r\ngreat festivals at Conjeeveram, Kumbakonam, and Srivilliputtur. Their\r\ntouch is not reckoned to defile the ropes used, so that other Hindus\r\nwill pull with them. With this may be compared the fact that the\r\nTelugu Malas are custodians of the goddess Gauri, the bull Nandi,\r\nand Ganesa, the chief gods of the Saiva Kapus and Balijas. It may\r\nalso be noted that the Komatis, who claim to be Vaisyas, are bound\r\nto invite Madigas to their marriages, though they take care that\r\nthe latter do not hear the invitation. Mr. Clayton records that he\r\nhas heard well-authenticated instances of Brahman women worshipping\r\nat Paraiyan shrines in order to procure children, and states that he\r\nonce saw a Paraiyan exorciser treating a Brahman by uttering mantrams\r\n(consecrated formulæ), and waving a sickle up and down the sufferer's\r\nback, as he stood in a threshing floor.\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Paraiyans of the Trichinopoly district,\r\nMr. F. R. Hemingway writes as follows. \"They have a very exalted\r\naccount of their lineage, saying that they are descended from the\r\nBrahman priest Sala Sambavan, who was employed in a Siva temple to\r\nworship the god with offerings of beef, but who incurred the anger\r\nof the god by one day concealing a portion of the meat, to give it to\r\nhis pregnant wife, and was therefore turned into a Paraiyan. The god\r\nappointed his brother to do duty instead of him, and the Paraiyans\r\nsay that Brahman priests are their cousins. For this reason they wear\r\na sacred thread at their marriages and funerals. At the festival of\r\nthe village goddesses, they repeat an extravagant praise of their\r\ncaste, which runs as follows. 'The Paraiyans were the first creation,\r\nthe first who wore the sacred thread, the uppermost in the social\r\nscale, the differentiators of castes, the winners of laurels. They\r\nhave been seated on the white elephant, the Vira Sambavans who beat\r\nthe victorious drum.' It is a curious fact that, at the feast of the\r\nvillage goddess, a Paraiyan is honoured by being invested with a sacred\r\nthread for the occasion by the pujari (priest) of the temple, by having\r\na turmeric thread tied to his wrists, and being allowed to head the\r\nprocession. This, the Paraiyans say, is owing to their exalted origin.\"\r\n\r\nIn times of drought some of the lower orders, instead of addressing\r\ntheir prayers to the rain god Varuna, try to induce a spirit or\r\ndevata named Kodumpavi (wicked one) to send her paramour Sukra to\r\nthe affected area. The belief seems to be that Sukra goes away to\r\nhis concubine for about six months, and, if he does not then return,\r\ndrought ensues. The ceremony consists in making a huge figure of\r\nKodumpavi in clay, which is placed on a cart, and dragged through\r\nthe streets for seven to ten days. On the last day, the final\r\ndeath ceremonies of the figure are celebrated. It is disfigured,\r\nespecially in those parts which are usually concealed. Vettiyans\r\n(Paraiyan grave-diggers), who have been shaved, accompany the figure,\r\nand perform the funeral ceremonies. This procedure is believed to\r\nput Kodumpavi to shame, and to get her to induce Sukra to return,\r\nand stay the drought. Paraiyans are said [55] to wail as though they\r\nwere at a funeral, and to beat drums in the funeral time.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans are said by Mr. Francis [56] to have a curious share\r\nin the ceremonies in connection with the annual buffalo sacrifice\r\nat the Kali shrine at Mangalam in South Arcot. \"Eight men of this\r\ncommunity are chosen from eight adjoining villages, and one of them\r\nis selected as leader. His wife must not be with child at the' time,\r\nand she is made to prove that she is above all suspicion by undergoing\r\nthe ordeal of thrusting her hand into boiling gingelly (Sesamum)\r\noil. On each of ten days for which the festival lasts, this Paraiyan\r\nhas to go round some part of the boundaries of the eight villages,\r\nand he is fed gratis by the villagers during this time. On the day\r\nof the sacrifice itself, he marches in front of the priest as the\r\nlatter kills the buffaloes. The Paraiyans of the eight villages have\r\nthe right to the carcases of the slaughtered animals.\"\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans know the village boundaries better than anyone else,\r\nand are very expert in this matter, unerringly pointing out where\r\nboundaries should run, even when the Government demarcation stones are\r\ncompletely overgrown by prickly-pear, or have been removed. Mr. Stuart\r\nrecords a custom which prevails in some parts of making a Paraiyan\r\nwalk the boundaries of a field with a pot of water on his head,\r\nwhen there is any dispute about their exact position. He thinks that\r\nthe only satisfactory explanation of this is that the connection of\r\nthe Paraiyans with the soil is of much longer standing than that\r\nof other castes. The admitted proprietary right which Paraiyans\r\nhave in the site known as cheri-nattam, on which their huts stand,\r\nis a confirmation of this. These sites are entered as such on the\r\nofficial village maps. They cannot be taken from the Paraiyans, and\r\ndate from time immemorial. Throughout the whole of the Tamil country\r\nit is usual to find that the land allotted for house-site (nattam)\r\nis in two portions in every village (Ur). One part is known by the\r\nSanskrit name gramam (village), the inhabited place. The other is\r\ncalled by the Dravidian name cheri (gathering place).\r\n\r\nSometimes the latter is called by the fuller title paracheri (Anglice\r\nparcheri, parcherry), i.e., the gathering place of the Paraiyans. In\r\nthe gramam live the Brahmans, who sometimes dwell, in a quarter\r\nby themselves known as the agrahara, and also other Hindus. In the\r\nparacheri live the Paraiyans. The paracheri and the gramam are always\r\nseparated, at least by a road or lane, and often by several fields. And\r\nnot only is it usual thus to find that, in every village, the Paraiyans\r\nas a community possess a house-site, but there are many cases in which\r\nmore than one cheri is attached to a gramam. This seems to repudiate\r\nthe suggestion that at some period or periods the higher castes\r\nrelegated the Paraiyans to these cheris. Indeed, in some cases, the\r\nvery names of the cheris suggest what appears to be the more correct\r\nview, viz., that the cheris had a distinct origin. For instance,\r\nthe whole revenue village of Teiyar near Chingleput consists of one\r\nSudra gramam and seven Paraiyan cheris, each with a name of its own,\r\nPeriyapilleri, Komancheri, etc. In other cases, e.g., Ideipalayam in\r\nthe north of the district, and Varadarajapuram near Vandalur, only\r\nParaiyan hamlets exist; there is no gramam. In South Arcot there\r\nare at least two villages, Govindanallur and Andapet, inhabited\r\nonly by Paraiyans, where even the Maniyakkaran (munsiff or village\r\nheadman) is a Paraiyan. Other instances might be quoted in proof of\r\nthe same opinion. And, when the ceremonial antipathy between Brahman\r\nand Paraiyan is examined, it points in the same direction. It is well\r\nknown that a Brahman considers himself polluted by the touch, presence,\r\nor shadow of a Paraiyan, and will not allow him to enter his house,\r\nor even the street in which he lives, if it is an agrahara. But it\r\nis not so well known that the Paraiyans will not allow a Brahman to\r\nenter the cheri. Should a Brahman venture into the Paraiyan's quarter,\r\nwater with which cow-dung has been mixed is thrown on his head, and\r\nhe is driven out. It is stated [57] by Captain J. S. F. Mackenzie\r\nthat \"Brahmans in Mysore consider that great luck will await them\r\nif they can manage to pass through the Holeya quarter of a village\r\nunmolested, and that, should a Brahman attempt to enter their quarters,\r\nthey turn out in a body and slipper him, in former times it is said to\r\ndeath.\" Some Brahmans consider a forsaken paracheri an auspicious site\r\nfor an agrahara. A very peculiar case is that of the gramam founded\r\nfor, and occupied by the clerks of the earliest Collectors (district\r\nmagistrates) of the jagir of Karunguli from 1795 to 1825 A.D. These\r\nclerks were Brahmans, and it was called the agraharam. It was deserted\r\nwhen the head-quarters of the Collector were removed to Conjeeveram. It\r\nis now occupied by Paraiyans, but is still called the agraharam.\r\n\r\nThe facts, taken together, seem to show that the Paraiyan priests\r\n(Valluvans), and therefore the Paraiyans as a race, are very ancient,\r\nthat ten centuries ago they were a respectable community, and that many\r\nwere weavers. The privileges they enjoy are relics of an exceedingly\r\nlong association with the land. The institution of the paracheri\r\npoints to original independence, and even to possession of much of the\r\nland. If the account of the colonisation of Tondeimandalam by Vellalans\r\nin the eighth century A.D. is historic, then it is possible that at\r\nthat time the Paraiyans lost the land, and that their degradation as\r\na race began.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans have long been a settled race. And, though a number of\r\nthem emigrate to Ceylon, Mauritius, South Africa, the West Indies,\r\nthe Straits Settlements, and even to Fiji, the vast majority live and\r\ndie within a mile or two of the spot where they were born. The houses\r\nin which they live are not temporary erections, or intended for use\r\nduring certain seasons of the year only. The rudest form is a hut made\r\nby tying a few leaves of the palmyra palm on to a framework of poles\r\nor bamboos. The better class of houses are a series of rooms with low\r\nmud walls and thatched roof, but generally without doors, surrounding\r\na small courtyard, in which the family goats, buffaloes, and fowls\r\nhave their homes. The cooking is done anywhere where it is convenient\r\neither indoors or out, as there is no fear of pollution from the glance\r\nor shadow of any passer-by. Very occasionally the walls of the house,\r\nespecially those facing the street, are whitewashed, or decorated with\r\nvariegated patterns or figures in red and white. Paraiya women, like\r\nhigher caste women, are much given to tracing exceedingly intricate\r\nsymmetrical designs (kolam) with rice flour on the smooth space or\r\npathway immediately before the doors of their houses, it is said,\r\nto prevent the entrance of evil spirits. Mr. S. P. Rice writes to\r\nme that the patterns on the floor or threshold are generally traced\r\nwith white powder, e.g., chalk, as rice is too costly; and that the\r\noriginal object of the custom was not to drive away evil spirits,\r\nbut to provide food for the lowest creatures of creation--ants,\r\ninsects, etc.\r\n\r\nAdmissions to the Paraiyan caste from higher castes sometimes\r\noccur. Mr. Clayton records having met an Aiyangar Brahman who was\r\nworking as a cooly with some Paraiyan labourers at Kodaikanal on the\r\nPalni hills. He had become infatuated with a Paraiya woman, and had\r\nconsequently been excommunicated, and became a Paraiyan.\r\n\r\nIn every Paraiya settlement a small number of the more important men\r\nare known as Panakkaran (money-man). The application of the term may,\r\nMr. Clayton suggests, be due to their comparative opulence, or may\r\nhave arisen from the custom of paying them a small sum (panam) for\r\nvarious services to the community. But Panikkar or Panakkar is usually\r\nsaid to be derived from pani, meaning work. They form a committee\r\nor council to decide ordinary quarrels, and to amerce the damages\r\nin cases of assault, seduction, rape, and adultery. They have power\r\nto dissolve marriages on account of the wife, or if the husband has\r\ndeserted his wife. In these cases their authority is really based on\r\nthe public opinion of the paracheri, and goes no further than that\r\npublic opinion will enforce it. There is no headman in a Paraiya hamlet\r\ncorresponding to the munsiff or village magistrate of the Hindu village\r\n(grama). In modern practice the Paraiyans are, for police purposes,\r\nunder the authority of the munsiff of the grama, and there is a\r\ngrowing tendency on their part to refer all disputes and assaults\r\nto the munsiff, or even directly to the police. On the other hand,\r\ncases of a more domestic nature, such as disputes about betrothals,\r\nseduction, etc., are still dealt with, generally acutely and fairly,\r\nby the village council. It should be added that the rank of Panakkaran\r\nis hereditary, and is regarded as honourable.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans, like all the other right-hand castes, come under the\r\njurisdiction of the Desayi Chettis, who have held a sort of censorship\r\nsince the days of the Nawabs of Arcot over some twenty-four of these\r\nright-hand castes, chiefly in North Arcot. The Desayi Chetti has\r\nnominal power to deal with all moral offences, and is supposed to have\r\na representative in every village, who reports every offence. But,\r\nthough his authority is great in North Arcot, and the fines levied\r\nthere bring in an income of hundreds of rupees yearly, it is not so\r\nmuch dreaded in other districts. The punishment usually inflicted is a\r\nfine, but sometimes a delinquent Paraiyan will be made to crawl on his\r\nhands and knees on the ground between the legs of a Paraiya woman as a\r\nfinal humiliation. The punishment of excommunication, i.e., cutting off\r\nfrom fire and water, is sometimes the fate of the recalcitrant, either\r\nbefore the council or the Desayi Chetti, but it is seldom effective for\r\nmore than a short time. Mr. K. Rangachari adds that, in certain places,\r\nthe Desayi Chetti appoints the Panakkaran, who is subordinate to the\r\nDesayi, and that a man called the Variyan or Shalavathi is sometimes\r\nappointed as assistant to the Panakkaran. He also mentions some other\r\npunishments. The fine for adultery is from 7 pagodas 14 fanams to\r\n11 pagodas, when the wronged woman is unmarried. If she is married,\r\nthe amount ranges from 12 pagodas 14 fanams to 16 pagodas. The fine\r\nis said to be divided between the woman, her husband, the members\r\nof council, and the Panakkarans. Formerly an offender against the\r\nParaiyan community was tied to a post at the beginning of his trial,\r\nand, if found guilty, was beaten. He might escape the flogging by\r\npaying a fine of two fanams per stripe. Sometimes a delinquent is\r\nparaded through the hamlet, carrying a rubbish basket, or is ordered\r\nto make a heap of rubbish at a certain spot. Or a cord is passed from\r\none big toe over the bowed neck of the culprit, and tied to his other\r\nbig toe, and then a stone is placed on his bent back. In some places,\r\nwhen an unmarried woman is convicted of adultery, she is publicly given\r\na new cloth and a bit of straw or a twig, apparently in mockery. It\r\nis said that formerly, if the chastity of a bride was suspected,\r\nshe had to pick some cakes out of boiling oil. This she had to do\r\njust after the tali had been tied in the wedding ceremony. Her hair,\r\nnails, and clothes were examined, to see that she had no charm\r\nconcealed. After lifting the cakes from the oil, she had to husk\r\nsome rice with her bare hand. If she could do this, her virtue was\r\nestablished. In the South Arcot district, according to Mr. Francis,\r\n[58] the Paraiyans \"have caste headmen called the Periya (big) Nattan\r\nand the Chinna (little) Nattan or Tangalan (our man), whose posts are\r\nusually hereditary. The Tangalan carries out the sentence of caste\r\npanchayats, administering a thrashing to the accused for example,\r\nif such be the order of the court. Of the fines inflicted by these\r\nassemblies, a fifth is usually handed over to the local Mariamma\r\nshrine, and the remaining four-fifths are laid out in drinks for the\r\npanchayatdars. Until recently, a part of the fine was in some cases,\r\nin these parts, paid to the local poligar.\"\r\n\r\nExcommunicated Paraiyans are said to go to a mythical place called\r\nVinnamangalam. In some documents signed by Paraiyans, the words\r\n\"If I fail to fulfil the conditions of our agreement, I shall go\r\nto Vinnamangalam\" are inserted. In all enquiries by the police, the\r\ncouncil, or the Desayi Chetti, the Paraiyan only tells what in his\r\nopinion it is expedient to tell. But evidence given after burning a\r\npiece of camphor is said to be reliable.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of puberty by girls is a subject of greedy curiosity\r\nto most of the women in a Paraiya village. This has been said to be\r\ndue to the fact that \"the menstrual fluid is held in horror, dire\r\nconsequences being supposed to result from not merely the contact,\r\nbut even the very sight of it. Hence the isolation and purification of\r\nwomen during the menstrual period, and the extreme care and anxiety\r\nwith which the first approach of puberty in a girl is watched.\" The\r\ngirl at once begins to wear a covering of some sort, even it be\r\nthe most pathetic rag, over her left shoulder and breast. Till\r\nthis time, a bit of cotton cloth round her waist has been considered\r\nsufficient. Among the Tangalan Paraiyans, when a girl attains puberty,\r\nshe is kept apart either in the house or in a separate hut. Pollution\r\nis supposed to last eight days. On the ninth day, the girl is bathed,\r\nand seated in the courtyard. Ten small lamps of flour paste (called\r\ndrishti mavu vilakku), to avert the evil eye, are put on a sieve,\r\nand waved before her three times. Then coloured water (arati or alam)\r\nand burning camphor are waved before her. Some near female relatives\r\nthen stand behind her, and strike her waist and sides with puttu\r\n(flour cake) tied in a cloth. This is believed to make her strong. At\r\nthe same time other women strike the ground behind the girl with\r\na rice-pestle. Then presents are given to the girl. In some places\r\nthe girl is beaten within the house by her mother-in-law or paternal\r\naunt. The latter repeatedly asks the girl to promise that her daughter\r\nshall marry her paternal aunt's son.\r\n\r\nIn marriages among the Paraiyans, difference in religion is of little\r\nmoment. A Christian Paraiyan will marry a heathen girl, though it\r\nshould be said that she is usually baptised at or about the time of\r\nthe marriage. A Christian girl is sometimes married to a heathen\r\nParaiyan. Mr. Clayton thinks that the fact that certain Paraiyans\r\npaint the namam of Vishnu on their foreheads, while others smear their\r\nforeheads with the ashes of Siva, prevents marriages between them.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom must be older than the bride. Subject to this condition,\r\nit is usual for a youth to marry his father's sister's daughter,\r\nor his mother's brother's daughter. A girl should be married to her\r\nmother's brother's son if he is old enough, but not, as among the\r\nKonga Vellalas and some Reddis, if he is a child. In short, Paraiyans\r\nfollow the usual Tamil custom, but it is often neglected.\r\n\r\nMarriage contracts are sometimes made by parents while the parties most\r\nconcerned are still infants, often while they are still children; in\r\nthe majority of cases when the girl attains the marriageable age. The\r\nbridegroom may be many years older than the bride, especially when\r\ncustom, as noted above, settles who shall be his bride. The bride\r\nhas absolutely no choice in the matter; but, if the bridegroom is\r\na man of some years or position, his preferences are consulted. The\r\nelder sister should be given in marriage before her younger sisters\r\nare married. The arrangements are more or less a bargain. Presents of\r\nclothes, paltry jewels, rice, vegetables, and perhaps a few rupees,\r\nare exchanged between the families of the bride and bridegroom. The\r\nhousehold that seeks the marriage naturally gives the larger gifts. The\r\nactual marriage ceremony is very simple. The essential part is the\r\ntying of a small token or ornament (tali), varying in value from a\r\nfew annas to four or five rupees by a turmeric-stained string, round\r\nthe neck of the bride. This is done by the bridegroom in the presence\r\nof a Valluvan, who mutters some kind of blessing on the marriage. A\r\nseries of feasts, lasting over two or three days, is given to all\r\nthe relatives of both parties by the parents of the newly-married\r\ncouple. The bride and bridegroom do not live together immediately,\r\neven if the girl is old enough. The exact date at which their life\r\ntogether may begin is settled by the bride's mother. The occasion,\r\ncalled soppana muhurtham, is celebrated by another feast and much\r\nmerry-making, not always seemly.\r\n\r\nThe following detailed account of the marriage ceremonies among the\r\nTangalan Paraiyans was furnished by Mr. K. Rangachari. The parents\r\nor near relations of the contracting parties meet, and talk over\r\nthe match. If an agreement is arrived at, an adjournment is made to\r\nthe nearest liquor shop, and a day fixed for the formal exchange of\r\nbetel leaves, which is the sign of a binding engagement. A Paraiyan,\r\nwhen he goes to seek the hand of a girl in marriage, will not eat at\r\nher house if her family refuse to consider the alliance, to which the\r\nconsent of the girl's maternal uncle is essential. The Paraiyan is\r\nparticular in the observation of omens, and, if a cat or a valiyan\r\n(a bird) crosses his path when he sets out in quest of a bride, he\r\nwill give her up. The betrothal ceremony, or pariyam, is binding as\r\nlong as the contracting couple are alive. They may live together as\r\nman and wife without performing the marriage ceremony, and children\r\nborn to them are considered as legitimate. But, when their offspring\r\nmarry, the parents must first go through the marriage rites, and\r\nthe children are then married in the same pandal on the same day. At\r\nthe betrothal ceremony, the headman, father, maternal uncle, and two\r\nnear relations of the bridegroom-elect, proceed to the girl's house,\r\nwhere they are received, and sit on seats or mats. Drink and plantain\r\nfruits are offered to them. Some conversation takes place between\r\nthe headmen of the two parties, such as \"Have you seen the girl? Have\r\nyou seen her house and relations? Are you disposed to recommend and\r\narrange the match?\" If he assents, the girl's headman says \"As long as\r\nstones and the Kaveri river exist, so that the sky goddess Akasavani\r\nand the earth goddess Bhumadevi may know it; so that the water-pot\r\n(used at the marriage ceremony), and the sun and moon may know it;\r\nso that this assembly may know it; I ... give this girl.\" The headman\r\nof the bridegroom then says \"The girl shall be received into the\r\nhouse by marriage. These thirty-six pieces of gold are yours, and\r\nthe girl is mine.\" He then hands betel leaves and areca nuts to the\r\nother headman, who returns them. The exchange of betel is carried out\r\nthree times. Near the headmen is placed a tray containing betel nuts,\r\na rupee, a turmeric-dyed cloth in which a fanam (2 1/2 annas) is tied,\r\na cocoanut, flowers, and the bride's money varying in amount from seven\r\nto twenty rupees. The fanam and bride's money are handed to the headman\r\nof the girl, and the rupee is divided between the two headmen. On the\r\nbetrothal day, the relations of the girl offer flowers, cocoanuts,\r\netc., to their ancestors, who are supposed to be without food or\r\ndrink. The Paraiyans believe that the ancestors will be ill-disposed\r\ntowards them, if they are not propitiated with offerings of rice and\r\nother things. For the purpose of worship, the ancestors are represented\r\nby a number of cloths kept in a box made of bamboo or other material,\r\nto which the offerings are made. On the conclusion of the ancestor\r\nworship, the two headmen go to a liquor shop, and exchange drinks of\r\ntoddy. This exchange is called mel sambandham kural, or proclaiming\r\nrelationship. After the lapse of a few days, the girl's family is\r\nexpected to pay a return visit, and the party should include at\r\nleast seven men. Betel is again exchanged, and the guests are fed,\r\nor presented with a small gift of money. When marriage follows close\r\non betrothal, the girl is taken to the houses of her relations,\r\nand goes through the nalugu ceremony, which consists of smearing\r\nher with turmeric paste, an oil bath, and presentation of betel and\r\nsweets. The auspicious day and hour for the marriage are fixed by\r\nthe Valluvan, or priest of the Paraiyans. The ceremonial is generally\r\ncarried through in a single day. On the morning of the wedding day,\r\nthree male and two married female relations of the bridegroom go\r\nto the potter's house to fetch the pots, which have been already\r\nordered. The potter's fee is a fowl, pumpkin, paddy, betel, and a few\r\nannas. The bride, accompanied by the headman and her relations, goes\r\nto the bridegroom's village, bringing with her a number of articles\r\ncalled petti varisai or box presents. These consist of a lamp, cup,\r\nbrass vessel, ear-ornament called kalappu, twenty-five betel leaves\r\nand areca nuts, onions, and cakes, a lump of jaggery (crude sugar),\r\ngrass mat, silver toe-ring, rice, a bundle of betel leaves and five\r\ncocoanuts, which are placed inside a bamboo box. The next item in\r\nthe proceedings is the erection of the milk-post, which is made of a\r\npestle of tamarind or Soymida febrifuga wood, or a green bamboo. To the\r\npost leafy twigs of the mango or pipal (Ficus religiosa) are tied. In\r\nsome places, a pole of the Odina Wodier tree is said to be set up,\r\nand afterwards planted near the house, to see if it will grow. Near\r\nthe marriage dais a pit is dug, into which are thrown nine kinds of\r\ngrain, and milk is poured. The milk-post is supported on a grindstone\r\npainted with turmeric stripes, washed with milk and cow's urine,\r\nand worshipped, with the Valluvan as the celebrant priest. The post\r\nis then set up in the pit by three men and two women. A string with\r\na bit of turmeric (kankanam) is tied to the milk-post, and to it\r\nand the dais boiled rice is offered. Kankanams are also tied round\r\nthe wrists of the bride and bridegroom. The bridegroom's party go to\r\nthe temple or house where the bride is awaiting them, bringing with\r\nthem a brass lamp, vessel and cup, castor and gingelly oil, combs,\r\nconfectionery, turmeric, and betel leaves. The procession is headed\r\nby Paraiyans beating tom-toms, and blowing on trumpets. When their\r\ndestination is reached, all take their seats on mats, and the various\r\narticles which they have brought are handed over to the headman, who\r\nreturns them. The bride is then taken in procession to the marriage\r\nhouse, which she is the first to enter. She is then told to touch with\r\nher right hand some paddy, salt, and rice, placed in three pots inside\r\nthe house. Touching them with the left hand would be an evil omen,\r\nand every mishap which might occur in the family would be traced to\r\nthe new daughter-in-law. The bride and bridegroom next go through the\r\nnalugu ceremony, and some of the relations proceed with the ceremony\r\nof bringing sand (manal vari sadangu). A cousin of the bridegroom and\r\nhis wife take three pots called sal karagam and kuresal, and repair to\r\na river, tank (pond) or well, accompanied by a few men and women. The\r\npots are set on the ground, and close to them are placed a lamp, and\r\na leaf with cakes, betel leaves and nuts set on it. Puja (worship)\r\nis made to the pots by burning camphor and breaking cocoanuts. The\r\nVettiyan then says \"The sun, the moon, the pots, and the owner of\r\nthe girl have come to the pandal. So make haste and fill the pot\r\nwith water.\" The woman dips a small pot in water, and, after putting\r\nsome sand or mud into a big pot, pours the water therein. The pots\r\nare then again worshipped. After the performance of the nalugu, the\r\nbridal couple go through a ceremony for removing the evil eye, called\r\n\"sige kazhippu.\" A leaf of Ficus religiosa, with its tail downwards,\r\nis held over their foreheads, and all the close relations pour\r\nwater over it, so that it trickles over their faces; or seven cakes\r\nare placed by each of the relations on the head, shoulders, knees,\r\nfeet, and other parts of the body of the bridegroom. The cakes are\r\nsubsequently given to a washerman. The parents of the bridal couple,\r\naccompanied by some of their relations, next proceed to an open field,\r\ntaking with them the cloths, tali, jewels, and other things which have\r\nbeen purchased for the wedding. A cloth is laid on the ground, and on\r\nit seven leaves are placed, and cooked rice, vegetables, etc., heaped\r\nup thereon. Puja is done, and a goat is sacrificed to the ancestors\r\n(Tangalanmar). By some the offerings are made to the village goddess\r\nPidari, instead of to the ancestors. Meanwhile the bridegroom has been\r\ntaken in procession round the village on horseback, and the headmen\r\nhave been exchanging betel in the pandal. On the bridegroom's return,\r\nhe and the bride seat themselves on planks placed on the dais, and\r\nare garlanded by their maternal uncle with wreaths of Nerium odorum\r\nflowers. The maternal uncle of the bride presents her with a ring. In\r\nsome places, the bride is carried to the dais on the shoulders or\r\nin the arms of the maternal uncle. While the couple are seated on\r\nthe dais the Valluvan priest lights the sacred fire (homam), and,\r\nrepeating some words in corrupt Sanskrit, pours gingelly oil into\r\nthe fire. He then does puja to the tali, and passes it round, to be\r\ntouched and blessed by those assembled. The bridegroom, taking up\r\nthe tali, shows it through a hole in the pandal to the sky or sun,\r\nand, on receipt of permission from those present, ties it round the\r\nneck of the bride. Thin plates of gold or silver, called pattam,\r\nare then tied on the foreheads of the contracting couple, first by\r\nthe mother-in-law and sister-in-law. With Brahman and non-Brahman\r\ncastes it is customary for the bride and bridegroom to fast until\r\nthe tali has been tied. With Paraiyans, on the contrary, the rite is\r\nperformed after a good meal. Towards the close of the marriage day,\r\nfruit, flowers, and betel are placed on a tray before the couple,\r\nand all the kankanams, seven in number, are removed, and put on\r\nthe tray. After burning camphor, the bridegroom hands the tray to\r\nhis wife, and it is exchanged between them three times. It is then\r\ngiven to the washerman. The proceedings terminate by the two going\r\nwith linked hands three times round the pandal. On the following day,\r\nthe bride's relatives purchase some good curds, a number of plantains,\r\nsugar and pepper, which are mixed together. All assemble at the pandal,\r\nand some of the mixture is given to the headman, the newly married\r\ncouple, and all who are present. All the articles which constitute\r\nthe bride's dowry are then placed in the pandal, and examined by\r\nthe headman. If they are found to be correct, he proclaims the union\r\nof the couple, and more of the mixture is doled out. This ceremony\r\nis known as sambandham kural or sambandham piriththal (proclaiming\r\nrelationship). Two or three days after the marriage, the bridegroom\r\ngoes to the house of the bride, and remains there for three days. He\r\nis stopped at the entrance by his brother-in-law, who washes his feet,\r\nputs rings on the second toe, and keeps on pinching his feet until he\r\nhas extracted a promise that the bridegroom will give his daughter, if\r\none is born to him, in marriage to the son of his brother-in-law. The\r\nring is put on the foot of the bride by her maternal uncle at the time\r\nof the marriage ceremony, after the wrist threads have been removed. In\r\nsome places it is done by the mother-in-law or sister-in-law, before\r\nthe tali is tied, behind a screen.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is not common among the Paraiyans, but Mr. Clayton has known\r\na few instances in which a Paraiyan had two regularly married wives,\r\neach wearing a tali. But it is very common to find that a Paraiyan\r\nhas, in addition to his formally married wife, another woman who\r\noccupies a recognised position in his household. The first wears the\r\ntali. The other woman does not, but is called the second wife. She\r\ncannot be dismissed without the sanction of the paracheri council. The\r\nman who maintains her is called her husband, and her children are\r\nrecognised as part of his family. Mr. Clayton believes that a second\r\nwife is usually taken only when the more formally married wife has\r\nno children, or when an additional worker is wanted in the house,\r\nor to help in the daily work. Thus a horsekeeper will often have\r\ntwo wives, one to prepare his meals and boil the gram for the horse,\r\nthe other to go out day by day to collect grass for the horse. The\r\nTamil proverb \"The experience of a man with two wives is anguish\"\r\napplies to all these double unions. There are constant quarrels\r\nbetween the two women, and the man is generally involved, often to\r\nhis own great inconvenience. It is quite common for a Paraiyan to\r\nmarry his deceased wife's sister, if she is not already married.\r\n\r\nA Paraiya woman usually goes to her mother's house a month or two\r\nbefore she expects the birth of her first child, which is born\r\nthere. Sometimes a medicine woman (maruttuvacchi), who possesses\r\nor professes some knowledge of drugs and midwifery, is called in,\r\nif the case is a bad one. Generally her barbarous treatment is but\r\nadditional torture to the patient. Immediately after the birth of\r\nthe child, the mother drinks a decoction called kashayam, in which\r\nthere is much ginger. Hence the Tamil proverb \"Is there any decoction\r\nwithout ginger in it?\" About a week after the birth, the mother,\r\nas a purificatory ceremony, is rubbed with oil and bathed.\r\n\r\nAmong Sudras there is a family ceremony, to which the Sanskrit name\r\nSimanta has been assigned, though it is not the true Simanta observed\r\nby Brahmans. It occurs only in connection with a first pregnancy. The\r\nexpectant mother stands bending over a rice mortar, and water or\r\nhuman milk is poured on her back by her husband's elder or younger\r\nsister. Money is also given to buy jewels for the expected child. The\r\nceremony is of no interest to anyone outside the family. Hence the\r\nproverb \"Come, ye villagers, and pour water on this woman's back.\" This\r\nis used when outsiders are called in to do for a member of a family\r\nwhat the relatives ought to do. This ceremony is sometimes observed\r\nby Paraiyans. Among Brahmans it is believed to affect the sex of\r\nthe child. It should be added that it is firmly believed that, if\r\na woman dies during pregnancy or in childbed, her spirit becomes an\r\nexceedingly malignant ghost, and haunts the precincts of the village\r\nwhere she dies.\r\n\r\nA widow does not wear the tali, which is removed at a gathering of\r\nrelatives some days after her husband's death. \"The removal of the\r\ntali of a widow,\" Mr. Francis writes, [59] \"is effected in a curious\r\nmanner. On the sixteenth day after the husband's death, another woman\r\nstands behind the widow, who stoops forward, and unties the tali\r\nin such a way that it falls into a vessel of milk placed to receive\r\nit. Adoption ceremonies are also odd. The adoptee's feet are washed\r\nin turmeric water by the adopter, who then drinks a little of the\r\nliquid. Adoption is accordingly known as manjanir kudikkiradu, or the\r\ndrinking of turmeric water, and the adopted son as the manjanir pillai,\r\nor turmeric water boy.\" Paraiya women do not wear any distinctive\r\ndress when they are widows, and do not shave their heads. But they\r\ncease to paint the vermilion mark (kunkumam) on their foreheads,\r\nwhich married women who are living with their husbands always wear,\r\nexcept at times when they are considered ceremonially unclean. The\r\nwidow of a Paraiyan, if not too old to bear children, generally lives\r\nwith another man as his wife. Sometimes she is ceremonially married\r\nto him, and then wears the tali. A widow practically chooses her own\r\nsecond husband, and is not restricted to any particular relative,\r\nsuch as her husband's elder or younger brother. The practice of the\r\nLevirate, by which the younger brother takes the widow of the elder,\r\nis non-existent as a custom among Paraiyas, though instances of such\r\nunions may be found. Indeed the popular opinion of the Tamil caste\r\ncredits the Paraiyan with little regard for any of the restrictions\r\nof consanguinity, either prohibitive or permissive. \"The palmyra palm\r\nhas no shadow: the Paraiyan has no regard for seemliness\" is a common\r\nTamil proverb.\r\n\r\nIt is stated, in the Madras Census Report, 1891, that \"the Paraiyans\r\nhave been but little affected by Brahmanical doctrines and customs,\r\nthough in respect to ceremonies they have not escaped their\r\ninfluence. Paraiyans are nominally Saivites, but in reality they are\r\ndemon worshippers.\" The Homakulam tank in the South Arcot district\r\nis reputed to be the place where Nanda, the Paraiyan saint, bathed\r\nbefore he performed sacrifice preparatory to his transfiguration to\r\nBrahmanhood. [60] Brahman influence has scarcely affected the Paraiyan\r\nat all, even in ceremonial. No Paraiyan may enter any Vaishnava or\r\nSaiva temple even of the humblest sort, though of course his offerings\r\nof money are accepted, if presented by the hands of some friendly\r\nSudra, even in such exclusive shrines as that of Sri Vira Raghava Swami\r\nat Tiruvallur. It is true that Paraiyans are often termed Saivites,\r\nbut there are many nominal Vaishnavas among them, who regularly wear\r\nthe namam of Vishnu on their foreheads. The truth is that the feminine\r\ndeities, commonly called devata, have been identified by Hindus with\r\nthe feminine energy of Siva, and thus the Paraiyans who worship them\r\nhave received the sectarian epithet. As a matter of fact, the wearing\r\nof the namam of Vishnu, or the smearing of the ashes of Siva, is of\r\nno meaning to a Paraiyan. They are neither Saivites nor Vaishnavites.\r\n\r\nLike all other Dravidians, the Paraiyans acknowledge the existence of\r\na supreme, omnipresent, personal spiritual Being, the source of all,\r\nwhom they call Kadavul (He who is). Kadavul possesses no temples,\r\nand is not worshipped, but he is the highest conception of Paraiya\r\nthought. Paraiyans worship at least three classes of godlings or\r\ndevata, generally called the mothers (amma). Sometimes they are\r\nworshipped as the virgins (Kanniyamma) or the seven virgins. These\r\nmothers may be worshipped collectively in a group. They are then\r\nsymbolised by seven stones or bricks, perhaps within a little\r\nenclosure, or on a little platform in the Paraiya hamlet, or under\r\na margosa (Melia Azadirachta) tree, or sheltered by a wattle hut,\r\nor even by a small brick temple. This temple is universally known as\r\nthe Amman Koil. More usually, one particular mother is worshipped at\r\nthe Paraiya shrine. She is then called the grama devata, or village\r\ngoddess, of the particular hamlet. The names of these goddesses are\r\nlegion. Each village claims that its own mother is not the same as\r\nthat of the next village, but all are supposed to be sisters. Each is\r\nsupposed to be the guardian of the boundaries of the cheri or gramam\r\nwhere her temple lies, sometimes of both gramam and cheri. She is\r\nbelieved to protect its inhabitants and its livestock from disease,\r\ndisaster and famine, to promote the fecundity of cattle and goats,\r\nand to give children. In a word, she is called the benefactress of\r\nthe place, and of all in it who worship her. The following are a few\r\nof the names of these village tutelary deities:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ellamma, goddess of the boundary, worshipped by Tamil and Telugu\r\n    Paraiyans.\r\n\r\n    Mungilamma, bamboo goddess.\r\n\r\n    Padeiyattal or Padeiyacchi.\r\n\r\n    Parrapotamma, a Telugu goddess supposed to cure cattle diseases.\r\n\r\n    Pidariyamma, sometimes called Ellei Pidari.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symbol of the goddess may be a conical stone, or a carved\r\nidol. Occasionally a rude figure of the bull Nandi, and an iron\r\ntrident mark the shrine. A lamp is often lighted before it at night.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial of worship of all classes of devata is very simple. The\r\nworshipper prostrates himself before the symbol of the deity,\r\nwhether one stone, seven stones, or an image. He anoints it with\r\noil, smears it with saffron, daubs it with vermilion, garlands it\r\nwith flowers (Nerium odorum by preference), burns a bit of camphor,\r\nand circumambulates the shrine, keeping his right side towards it. On\r\nspecial occasions he breaks cocoanuts, kills fowls, goats or sheep, of\r\nwhich the two last must be killed at one blow, pours out their blood,\r\nperhaps offers a little money, and goes his way, satisfied that he\r\nhas done his best to propitiate the devata whom he has honoured.\r\n\r\nSpecial shrines attain very great fame. Thus the goddess Bavaniyammal\r\nof Periyapalayam, some sixteen miles from Madras, is well known, and\r\ncrowds come to her annual festival. Paraiyans, Pallis, and Chakkilians\r\nform the majority of the worshippers, but of late years Sudras and\r\neven Brahmans are to be found at her shrine. The homage rendered to\r\nher is twofold. Her worshippers sacrifice some thousands of sheep on\r\nthe river bank outside her temple, and, entirely divesting themselves\r\nof their garments, and covering themselves with bunches of margosa\r\nleaves, go round the temple. Except on the five Sundays, usually in\r\nJuly and August, on which the festival is held, the shrine is forsaken,\r\nand the goddess is said to be a vegetarian; but on the five festival\r\nSundays she is said to be as greedy for flesh as a leather-dresser's\r\n(Chakkiliyan) wife.\r\n\r\nTwo goddesses hold a position distinct from the mothers as a group,\r\nor as tutelary goddesses. These are Gangammal and Mariyattal, and\r\ntheir peculiarity is that they are itinerant deities. Gangammal\r\nis often described as the goddess of cholera, and Mariyattal,\r\nas the goddess of small-pox, though both diseases are frequently\r\nascribed to the latter. Mariyattal is worshipped under the names of\r\nPoleramma and Ammavaru by Telugus. For instance, near Arcotkuppam in\r\nthe North Arcot district, a festival is held in honour of Gangammal\r\nin the Tamil month Vaikasi (May-June), in which Sudras join. The main\r\nfeature of the festival is the boiling of new rice as at Pongal. Men\r\nalso put on women's clothes, and perform grotesque dances. In the\r\nsame way, in the ten days' festival in honour of Mariyattal held at\r\nUttaramallur during the Tamil month Avani (August), the goddess is\r\ncarried about by washermen (Vannan), who perform a kind of pantomime\r\n(vilas) in her honour. There is a curious belief that these goddesses\r\n(or Gangammal, if they are distinguished) must travel along roads and\r\npaths, and cannot go across country, and that they cannot pass over\r\nthe leaves of the margosa or the stems of the plant called in Tamil\r\nperandei (Vitis quadrangularis). Consequently, when cholera is about,\r\nand the goddess is supposed to be travelling from village to village\r\nseeking victims, branches of margosa and long strings of perandei are\r\nplaced on all the paths leading into the gramam or cheri. Sometimes,\r\nalso, leaves of the margosa are strung together, and hung across the\r\nvillage street. These are called toranam.\r\n\r\nBesides the deities already referred to, there are a number\r\nof ghosts, ghouls, and goblins (pey or pisasu), whom Paraiyans\r\npropitiate. Mathureiviran and Virabadran are, for example, two\r\nwell-known demons.\r\n\r\nAmong Tamil Paraiyans there are families in almost every village,\r\nwho hold a kind of sacerdotal rank in the esteem of their\r\nfellows. They are called Valluvans, Valluva Pandarams, or Valluva\r\nParaiyans. Their position and authority depend largely on their own\r\nastuteness. Sometimes they are respected even by Brahmans for their\r\npowers as exorcists. It is often impossible to see any difference\r\nbetween the Valluvans and the ordinary Paraiyans, except that their\r\nhouses are usually a little apart from other houses in the cheri. They\r\ntake a leading part in local Paraiya festivals. At marriages they\r\npronounce the blessing when the tali is tied round the bride's neck.\r\n\r\nIn cases of supposed possession by demons, or by the mothers, the\r\nValluvan is consulted as to the meaning of the portent, and takes part\r\nin driving the spirit out of the victim, sometimes using violence and\r\nblows to compel the spirit to deliver its message and be gone. The\r\nCensus Report, 1901, states that Valluvans do not eat or intermarry\r\nwith other sections of the Paraiyans. Mr. Clayton is unable to confirm\r\nthis, and is inclined to doubt whether it is generally true.\r\n\r\nThe dead are buried as a rule, but sometimes the corpses are burnt. A\r\nportion of the village waste land is allotted for the purpose. Only\r\nParaiyans are buried in it. The funeral rites are very simple. The\r\ncorpse is carried on a temporary litter of palm leaf mats and bamboos,\r\nwrapped in a cotton cloth, which is a new one if it can be afforded,\r\nand interred or burnt. About the third or fifth day after death,\r\nthe pal sadangu, or milk ceremony, should take place, when some milk\r\nis poured out by the next-of-kin as an offering to the spirit of the\r\ndeceased. This spirit is then supposed to assume a sort of corporeity,\r\nand to depart to the place of respite till fate decrees that it be\r\nre-born. This ceremony is accompanied by a family feast. On the\r\nfifteenth day after death, another family gathering is held, and\r\nfood is offered to the spirit of the dead person. This ceremony is\r\ncalled Karumantaram, or expiatory ceremony. Occasionally, for some\r\nmonths after the death, a few flowers are placed on the grave, and a\r\ncocoanut is broken over it; and some attempt is even made to recognise\r\nthe anniversary of the date. But there is no regular custom and it is\r\nprobably an imitation of Brahmanical usages. The ordinary Paraiyan's\r\nconception of life after death is merely a vague belief that the\r\ndeparted soul continues its existence somewhere. He has no ordered\r\neschatology. If a first-born male child dies, it is buried close to\r\nor even within the house, so that its corpse may not be carried off\r\nby a witch or sorcerer, to be used in magic rites, as the body of a\r\nfirst-born child is supposed to possess special virtues. It is noted\r\nby Mr. H. A. Stuart [61] that \"the Tangalans profess to have once been\r\na very respectable class, and wear the sacred thread at weddings and\r\nfunerals, while the other divisions never assume it.\"\r\n\r\nThe following note on the death ceremonies of the Paraiyans at\r\nCoimbatore was supplied by Mr. V. Govindan. If the deceased was a\r\nmarried man, the corpse is placed in a sitting posture in a booth\r\nmade of twigs of margosa and milk-hedge (Euphorbia Tirucalli), and\r\nsupported behind by a mortar. The widow puts on all her ornaments,\r\nand decorates her hair with flowers. She seats herself on the left\r\nside of the corpse, in the hands of which some paddy (unhusked rice)\r\nor salt is placed. Taking hold of its hands, some one pours the\r\ncontents thereof into the hands of the widow, who replaces them in\r\nthose of the corpse. This is done thrice, and the widow then ties\r\nthe rice in her cloth. On the way to the burial ground (sudukadu),\r\nthe son carries a new pot, the barber a pot of cooked rice and\r\nbrinjal (Solanum Melongena) fruits and other things required for\r\ndoing puja. The Paraiyan in charge of the burial ground carries a\r\nfire-brand. The mats and other articles used by the deceased, and\r\nthe materials of which the booth was made, are carried in front by\r\nthe washerman, who deposits them at a spot between the house of the\r\ndeceased and the burial ground called the idukadu, which is made to\r\nrepresent the shrine of Arichandra. Arichandra was a king, who became\r\na slave of the Paraiyans, and is in charge of the burial ground. At\r\nthe idukadu the corpse is placed on the ground, and the son, going\r\nthrice round it, breaks the pot of rice near its head. The barber\r\nmakes a mark at the four corners of the bier, and the son places a\r\nquarter anna on three of the marks, and some cowdung on the mark\r\nat the north-east corner. The widow seats herself at the feet of\r\nthe corpse, and another widowed woman breaks her tali string, and\r\nthrows it on the corpse. Arrived at the grave, the gurukal (priest)\r\ndescends into it, does puja and applies vibhuti (sacred ashes) to its\r\nsides. The body is lowered into it, and half a yard of cloth from the\r\nwinding-sheet is given to the Paraiyan, and a quarter of a yard to\r\nan Andi (religious mendicant). The grave is filled in up to the neck\r\nof the corpse, and bael (Ægle Marmelos) leaves, salt, and vibhuti\r\nare placed on its head by the gurukal. The grave is then filled in,\r\nand a stone and thorny branch placed at the head end. As the son goes,\r\ncarrying the water-pot, three times round the grave, the barber makes\r\na hole in the pot, which is thrown on the stone. The son and other\r\nrelations bathe and return to the house, where a vessel containing\r\nmilk is set on a mortar, and another containing water placed at the\r\ndoor. They dip twigs of the pipal (Ficus religiosa) into the milk,\r\nand throw them on the roof. They also worship a lighted lamp. On\r\nthe third day, cooked rice, and other food for which the deceased\r\nhad a special liking, are taken to the grave, and placed on plantain\r\nleaves. Puja is done, and the crows are attracted to the spot. If they\r\ndo not turn up, the gurukal prays, and throws up water three times. On\r\nthe seventeenth day, the son and others, accompanied by the gurukal,\r\ncarry a new brick and articles required for puja to the river. The\r\nbrick is placed under water, and the son bathes. The articles for\r\npuja are spread on a plantain leaf, before which the son places the\r\nbrick. Puja is done to it, and a piece of new cloth tied on it. It is\r\nthen again carried to the water, and immersed therein. The ceremonial\r\nconcludes with the lighting of the sacred fire (homam).\r\n\r\nThe death ceremonies of the Paraiyan, as carried out in the Chingleput\r\ndistrict, are thus described by Mr. K. Rangachari. The corpse is\r\nwashed, dressed, and carried on a bier to the burning or burial\r\nground. Just before it is placed on the bier, all the relations,\r\nwho are under pollution, go round it three times, carrying an iron\r\nmeasure round which straw has been wrapped, and containing a light. On\r\nthe way to the burial ground, the son or grandson scatters paddy,\r\nwhich has been fried by the agnates. A pot of fire is carried by\r\nthe Vettiyan. At a certain spot the bier is placed on the ground,\r\nand the son goes round it, carrying a pot of cooked rice, which he\r\nbreaks near the head of the corpse. This rice should not be touched\r\nby man or beast, and it is generally buried. When the corpse has been\r\nplaced on the pyre, or laid in the grave, rice is thrown over it by\r\nthe relations. The son, carrying a pot of water, goes thrice round it,\r\nand asks those assembled if he may finish the ceremony. On receiving\r\ntheir assent, he again goes three times round the corpse, and, making\r\nthree holes in the pot, throws it down, and goes home without looking\r\nback. If the dead person is unmarried, a mock marriage ceremony,\r\ncalled kanni kaziththal (removing bachelorhood), is performed before\r\nthe corpse is laid on the bier. A garland of arka (Calotropis gigantea)\r\nflowers and leaves is placed round its neck, and balls of mud from a\r\ngutter are laid on the head, knees, and other parts of the body. In\r\nsome places a variant of the ceremony consists in the erection of a\r\nmimic marriage booth which is covered with leaves of the arka plant,\r\nflowers of which are placed round the neck as a garland. On the\r\nthird day after death, cooked rice, milk, fruits, etc., are offered\r\nto the soul of the departed on two leaves placed one near the head,\r\nthe other near the feet of the corpse. Of these, the former is taken\r\nby men, and the latter by women, and eaten. The karmanthiram, or final\r\nceremony, takes place on the twelfth or sixteenth day. All concerned in\r\nit proceed to a tank with cooked rice, cakes, etc. A figure of Ganesa\r\n(Pillayar) is made with mud, and five kalasam (vessels) are placed near\r\nit. The various articles which have been brought are set out in front\r\nof it. Two bricks, on which the figures of a man and woman are drawn,\r\nare given to the son, who washes them, and does puja to them after an\r\neffigy has been made at the waterside by a washerman. He then says\r\n\"I gave calves and money. Enter Kailasam (the abode of Siva). Find\r\nyour way to paralokam (the other world). I gave you milk and fruit. Go\r\nto the world of the dead. I gave gingelly (Sesamum) and milk. Enter\r\nyamalokam (abode of the god of death). Eleven descendants on the\r\nmother's side and ten on the father's, twenty-one in all, may they\r\nall enter heaven.\" He then puts the bricks into the water. On their\r\nreturn home, the sons of the deceased are presented with new clothes.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, that, when\r\na man dies, camphor is not burnt in the house, but at the junction of\r\nthree lanes. Some Paraiyans, on the occurrence of a death in a family,\r\nput a pot filled with dung or water, a broomstick and a fire-brand at\r\nsome place where three roads meet, or in front of the house, in order\r\nto prevent the ghost from returning. An impression of the dead man's\r\npalm is taken in cow-dung, and stuck on the wall. In some places,\r\ne.g., at Tirutturaippundi, the Paraiyans observe a ceremony rather\r\nlike that observed by Valaiyans and Karaiyans on the heir's return\r\nfrom the burning-ground on the second day. Three rice-pounders and a\r\nchembu (vessel) of water are placed outside the door, and the heir\r\nsits on these, chews a piece of fish, spits thrice, and then goes\r\nand worships a light burning in the house.\r\n\r\nTattooing is practiced on women and children of both sexes, but not on\r\ngrown men. With children it is confined to a simple line drawn down\r\nthe forehead. Among Paraiyans who have become Roman Catholics, the\r\ndevice is sometimes a cross. Women, like those of other Tamil castes,\r\nfrequently have their arms elaborately tattooed, and sometimes have a\r\nsmall pattern between the breasts. A legend runs to the effect that,\r\nmany years ago, a Paraiyan woman wished her upper arms and chest to\r\nbe tattooed in the form of a bodice. The operation was successfully\r\ncarried out till the region of the heart was reached, and then a\r\nvulnerable part was punctured by the needles, with the result that the\r\nwoman died. Whence has arisen a superstitious objection to tattooing\r\nof the breasts.\r\n\r\nSometimes an arei-mudi, shaped like the leaf of the puvarasa tree\r\n(Thespesia populnea), made of silver or silvered brass, is tied\r\nround the waist of female infants as an ornament. Small, flat plates\r\nof copper, called takudu, are frequently worn by children. One side\r\nis divided into sixteen squares, in which, what look like the Telugu\r\nnumerals nine, ten, eleven and twelve are engraved. On the other side\r\na circle is drawn, which is divided into eight segments, in each of\r\nwhich a Telugu letter is inscribed. This charm is supposed to protect\r\nthe wearer from harm coming from any of the eight cardinal points of\r\nthe Indian compass. Charms, in the form of metal cylinders, are worn\r\nfor the same purpose by adults and children, and procured from some\r\nexorcist. Similar or the same charms are worn to avoid the baneful\r\ninfluence of the evil eye. To prevent this from affecting their crops,\r\nParaiyans put up scarecrows in their fields. These are usually small\r\nbroken earthen pots, whitewashed or covered with spots of whitewash,\r\nor even adorned with huge clay noses and ears, and made into grotesque\r\nfaces. They are set up on the end of poles, to attract the eye of the\r\npasser-by from the crop. For the same reason more elaborate figures,\r\nmade of mud and twigs, in human shape, are sometimes set up. Before\r\nwells are sunk, a charmer (mantirakkaran) is called in to recite\r\nspells and find a likely spot, cocoanuts are broken, and the milk\r\nthereof poured out to propitiate the gods of the place.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans are very largely employed as domestic servants by\r\nEuropeans. And it has been said that \"so necessary to the comfort of\r\nthe public is the Paraiya that orthodox Brahman gentlemen may be seen\r\nemploying Paraiya coachmen and syces (footmen). The Christian Paraiya\r\nhas become 'Native Christian' caste, and has achieved, among other\r\nthings, University honours, the wearing of the surplice, and the rod\r\nof the pedagogue.\" [62] Vast numbers of Paraiyans are agricultural\r\nlabourers. Till a score or so of years ago some were actually bond\r\nserfs, and there are instances on record in quite recent years, which\r\nshow that it was no infrequent thing for a Paraiyan to mortgage his\r\nson as security for the repayment of a loan. Some Paraiya families\r\nown much land.\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. Francis [63] that in the South Arcot district,\r\n\"their numbers, and the comparative wealth which ground-nut (Arachis\r\nhypogæa) cultivation has brought them, have caused them to take\r\na rather better social position here than elsewhere, and they are\r\nactually beginning to copy the social ways of the higher castes,\r\nsometimes burning their dead (though those who have died of cholera\r\nor small-pox are still always buried), marrying their children when\r\ninfants, and looking with disfavour on the remarriage of widows.\"\r\n\r\nCurrent Tamil speech and custom divide the landless labouring Paraiyans\r\ninto padiyal and kuliyal. The padiyal is definitely and hereditarily\r\nattached to some land-holding family in the Hindu grama. He can work\r\nfor no one else, and cannot change masters. His privilege is that in\r\ntimes of drought and famine his master must support him. The kuliyal\r\nis a mere day labourer, only employed, and therefore only receiving\r\npay (kuli) when required. He has no claim for maintenance in seasons\r\nof scarcity, and, though no man's serf, is worse off than the padiyal.\r\n\r\nThree communal servants, the grave-digger (Vettiyan), watchman\r\n(Talaiyari), and scavenger (Toti) are all Paraiyans. The Vettiyan\r\nofficiates when a corpse is buried or burned. Hence the proverb\r\nagainst meddling in what ought to be left to some one else:--\"Let the\r\nVettiyan and the corpse struggle together.\" The Rev. H. Jensen notes\r\n[64] in connection with this proverb that \"when fire is applied to the\r\npyre at the burning-ground, it sometimes happens that the muscles of\r\nthe corpse contract in such a fashion that the body moves, and the\r\ngrave-digger has to beat it down into the fire. It looks as if the\r\ntwo were engaged in a struggle. But no one else should interfere. The\r\ngrave-digger knows his own work best.\"\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. H. A. Stuart [65] that \"among the lower class of\r\nVellam Paraiyans, who are the village totis, the following legend is\r\ncurrent, accounting for the perquisites which they get for performing\r\nthe menial work of the village. When Adi Sesha was supporting the\r\nearth, he became weary, and prayed to Siva for assistance. Siva ordered\r\na Paraiyan to beat upon his drum, and cry 'Let the ripe decay.' The\r\nParaiyan enquired what should be his reward, and was granted the\r\nfollowing privileges, viz., mankuli (reward for burning corpses),\r\nsan tuni (a span cloth), vaykkarisi (the rice in the corpse's mouth),\r\npinda soru (morsel of boiled rice), and suttu kuli (fee for bringing\r\nfirewood). This seemed to the Paraiya very little, and so, to increase\r\nthe death-rate and consequently his perquisites, he cried 'Let the\r\nripe and the unripe decay.' The swami (god) remonstrated with him,\r\nfor the result of his cry was that children and the middle-aged among\r\nmen died. The man pleaded poverty, and was given four additional\r\nprivileges, viz., a merkal to measure grain, a rod to measure the\r\nground, a scythe to cut grass, and the privilege of carrying the\r\nkaragam-pot when annually running over the village boundary. All the\r\nabove privileges still belong to the village vettis, who receive fees\r\nfor performing the duties referred to in the legend.\"\r\n\r\nSome Paraiyans eat carrion, and Mr. Clayton has known them dig up\r\na buffalo which had been buried some hours, and eat its flesh. It is\r\nsaid that even the lowest Paraiyans will not eat the flesh of cows, but\r\nleave that to the leather-dressers (Chakkiliyans). Mr. Stuart, however,\r\nstates [66] that \"the Konga Paraiyans and the Vellam Paraiyans, who\r\ndo scavenging work, will eat cows that have died a natural death,\r\nwhile Tangalans only eat such as have been slaughtered.\" In time of\r\nfamine, the Paraiyans dig into ant-hills to rob the ants of their\r\nstore of grass seed. This is called pillarisi or grass rice.\r\n\r\nThere are many proverbs in Tamil, which refer to Paraiyans, from\r\nwhich the following are selected:--\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) If a Paraiyan boils rice, will it not reach God? i.e., God will\r\nnotice all piety, even that of a Paraiyan.\r\n(2) When a Paraiya woman eats betel, her ten fingers (will be daubed\r\nwith) lime. The Paraiya woman is a proverbial slut.\r\n(3) Though a Paraiya woman's child be put to school, it will still\r\nsay Ayye. Ayye is vulgar Tamil for Aiyar, meaning Sir.\r\n(4) The palmyra palm has no shadow; the Paraiyan has no decency. A\r\ncontemptuous reference to Paraiya morality.\r\n(5) The gourd flower and the Paraiyan's song have no savour. Paraiyans\r\nuse this saying about their own singing.\r\n(6) Though seventy years of age, a Paraiyan will only do what he\r\nis compelled.\r\n(7) You may believe a Paraiyan, even in ten ways; you cannot believe\r\na Brahman. Almost the only saying in favour of the Paraiyan.\r\n(8) Is the sepoy who massacred a thousand horse now living in disgrace\r\nwith the dogs of the paracheri?\r\n(9) Paraiyan's talk is half-talk. A reference to Paraiya vulgarisms\r\nof speech.\r\n(10) Like Paraiya and Brahman, i.e., as different as possible.\r\n(11) Not even a Paraiyan will plough on a full moon day.\r\n(12) Paracheri manure gives a better yield than any other manure.\r\n(13) The drum is beaten at weddings, and also at funerals. Said,\r\naccording to the Rev. H. Jensen, of a double-dealing unreliable person,\r\nwho is as ready for good as for evil.\r\n(14) The harvest of the Paraiya never comes home.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term Paraiya, it may be noted, is applied to the common dog of\r\nIndian towns and villages, and to the scavenger kite, Milvus Govinda.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans are included by Mr. F. S. Mullaly in his 'Notes on\r\nCriminal Classes of the Madras Presidency.' \"The local criminals,\" he\r\nwrites, \"throughout the Presidency in all villages are the Paraiyas,\r\nand, though they cannot be considered de facto a criminal tribe,\r\nyet a very large proportion of the criminals of the Presidency are\r\nof this caste, notable among them being the Vepur Paraiyas of South\r\nArcot.\" For an account of these Vepur Paraiyas and their methods I must\r\nrefer the reader to Mr. Mullaly's description thereof. Concerning these\r\ncriminal Paraiyans, Mr. Francis writes as follows. [67] \"There is one\r\nbranch of them in Suttukulam, a hamlet of Cuddalore. They are often\r\nknown as the Tiruttu (thieving) Paraiyans. The crimes to which they\r\nare most addicted are house-breaking and the theft of cattle, sheep\r\nand goats, and the difficulty of bringing them to book is increased by\r\nthe organised manner in which they carry on their depredations. They\r\nare, for example, commonly in league with the very heads of villages,\r\nwho ought to be doing their utmost to secure their arrest, and they\r\nhave useful allies in some of the Udaiyans of these parts. It is\r\ncommonly declared that their relations are sometimes of a closer\r\nnature, and that the wives of Vepur Paraiyans who are in enforced\r\nretirement are cared for by the Udaiyans. To this is popularly\r\nattributed the undoubted fact that these Paraiyans are often much\r\nfairer in complexion than other members of that caste.\" It is said\r\nto be traditional among the Vepur Paraiyans that the talis (marriage\r\nbadges) of Hindu women and lamps should not be stolen from a house,\r\nand that personal violence should not be resorted to, except when\r\nunavoidably necessary for the purpose of escape or self-defence.\r\n\r\nIn a kindly note on the Paraiya classes, Surgeon-Major W. R. Cornish\r\nsums them up as follows. [68] \"A laborious, frugal, and pleasure-loving\r\npeople, they are the very life-blood of the country, in whatever field\r\nof labour they engage in. The British administration has freed them,\r\nas a community, from the yoke of hereditary slavery, and from the\r\nlegal disabilities under which they suffered; but they still remain in\r\nthe lowest depths of social degradation. The Christian missionaries,\r\nto their undying honour be it said, have, as a rule, persevered in\r\nbreaking through the time-honoured custom of treating the Paraiya as\r\ndirt, and have admitted him to equal rights and privileges in their\r\nschools and churches, and, whatever may be the present position\r\nof the Paraiya community in regard to education, intelligence, and\r\nability to hold a place for themselves, they owe it almost wholly\r\nto the Christian men and women who have given up their lives to win\r\nsouls for their great Master.\"\r\n\r\nParaiyans of Malabar, Cochin and Travancore.--For the following note on\r\nthe Paraiyans or Paraiyas of Cochin I am indebted to Mr. L. K. Anantha\r\nKrishna Aiyar. [69] Paraiyas belong to a very low caste of the agrestic\r\nserfs of Cochin, next to Pulayas in order of social precedence. They\r\nwill eat at the hands of all castes, save Ulladans, Nayadis, and\r\nPulayas. But orthodox Pulayas have to bathe five times, and let\r\nblood flow, in order to be purified from pollution if they touch a\r\nParaiya. In rural parts, a Paraiya's hut may be seen far away on\r\nthe hill-side. At the approach of a member of some higher caste,\r\nthe inmates run away to the forest. They cannot walk along the public\r\nroads, or in the vicinity of houses occupied by the higher castes. It\r\nis said that they at times steal the children of Nayars, and hide\r\nthem in the forest, to bring them up as their own. They are extremely\r\nfilthy in person and habits. They very rarely bathe, or wash their\r\nbodies, and a cloth, purchased at harvest time, is worn till it falls\r\nto pieces. They will eat the flesh of cattle, and are on this account\r\ndespised even by the Pulayas. They are their own barbers and washermen.\r\n\r\nA legend runs to the effect that Vararuchi, the famous astrologer,\r\nand son of a Brahman named Chandragupta and his Brahman wife,\r\nbecame the King of Avanthi, and ruled till Vikramaditya, the son of\r\nChandragupta by his Kshatriya wife, came of age, when he abdicated\r\nin his favour. Once, when he was resting under an ashwastha tree\r\n(Ficus religiosa), invoking the support of the deity living therein, he\r\noverheard the conversation of two Gandarvas on the tree, to the effect\r\nthat he would marry a Paraiya girl. This he prevented by requesting\r\nthe king to have her enclosed in a box, and floated down a river\r\nwith a nail stuck into her head. The box was taken possession of by\r\na Brahman, who was bathing lower down, and, on opening it, he found a\r\nbeautiful girl, whom he considered to be a divine gift, and regarded\r\nas his own daughter. One day the Brahman, seeing Vararuchi passing\r\nby, invited him to mess with him, and his invitation was accepted on\r\ncondition that he would prepare eighteen curries, and give him what\r\nremained after feeding a hundred Brahmans. The Brahman was puzzled,\r\nbut the maiden, taking a long leaf, placed thereon a preparation of\r\nginger corresponding to eighteen curries, and with it some boiled rice\r\nused as an offering at the Vaiswadeva ceremony, as the equivalent of\r\nthe food for Brahmans. Knowing this to be the work of the maiden,\r\nVararuchi desired to marry her, and his wish was acceded to by the\r\nBrahman. One day, while conversing with his wife about their past\r\nlives, he chanced to see a nail stuck in her head, and he knew her\r\nto be the girl whom he had caused to be floated down the stream. He\r\naccordingly resolved to go on a pilgrimage with his wife, bathing in\r\nrivers, and worshipping at temples. At last they came to Kerala, where\r\nthe woman bore him twelve sons, all of whom, except one, were taken\r\ncare of by members of different castes. They were all remarkable for\r\ntheir wisdom, and believed to be the avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu,\r\ngifted with the power of performing miracles. One of them was Pakkanar,\r\nthe great Malayalam bard. Once, it is said, when some Brahmans\r\nresolved to go to Benares, Pakkanar tried to dissuade them from so\r\ndoing by telling them that the journey to the sacred city would not be\r\nproductive of salvation. To prove the fruitlessness of their journey,\r\nhe plucked a lotus flower from a stagnant pool, and gave it to them\r\nwith instructions to deliver it to a hand which would rise from the\r\nGanges, when they were to say that it was a present for the goddess\r\nGanga from Pakkanar. They did as directed, and returned with news of\r\nthe miracle. Pakkanar then led them to the stagnant pool, and said\r\n\"Please return the lotus flower, Oh! Ganga,\" when it appeared in his\r\nhand. Pakkanar is said to have earned his living by the sale of the\r\nwicker-work, which he made. One day he could not sell his baskets, and\r\nhe had to go starving. A neighbour, however, gave him some milk, which\r\nPakkanar accepted, and told the donor to think of him if ever he was\r\nin danger. The neighbour had a married daughter living with him, who,\r\nsome time after, was dying of snake-bite. But her father remembered\r\nthe words of Pakkanar, who came to the rescue, and cured her. One of\r\nPakkanar's brothers was named Narayana Branthan, who pretended to\r\nbe a lunatic, and whose special delight was in rolling huge stones\r\nup a hill, for the pleasure of seeing them roll down. Though the son\r\nof a Brahman, he mixed freely with members of all castes, and had no\r\nscruple about dining with them. A Nambutiri Brahman once asked him to\r\nchoose an auspicious day for the performance of his son's upanayanam\r\n(thread ceremony). He selected a most inauspicious day and hour,\r\nwhen the boy's family assembled and asked Narayana whether the rite\r\nshould be celebrated. He told the father to look at the sky, which\r\nbecame brilliantly illuminated, and a Brahman was seen changing his\r\nsacred thread. The omen being considered favourable, the investiture\r\nceremony was proceeded with.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyas of Malabar and Cochin are celebrated for their knowledge\r\nof black magic, and are consulted in matters relating to theft,\r\ndemoniacal influence, and the killing of enemies. Whenever anything is\r\nstolen, the Paraiya magician is consulted. Giving hopes of the recovery\r\nof the stolen article, he receives from his client some paddy (rice)\r\nand a few panams (money), with which he purchases plantain fruits, a\r\ncocoanut or two, toddy, camphor, frankincense, and rice flour. After\r\nbathing, he offers these to his favourite deity Parakutti, who is\r\nrepresented by a stone placed in front of his hut. Rattling an iron\r\ninstrument, and singing till his voice almost fails, he invokes the\r\ngod. If the lost property does not turn up, he resorts to a more\r\nindignant and abusive form of invocation. If the thief has to be\r\ncaught, his prayers are redoubled, and he becomes possessed, and blood\r\npasses out of his nose and mouth. When a person is ill, or under the\r\ninfluence of a demon, an astrologer and a magician named by the former\r\nare consulted. The magician, taking a cadjan (palm) leaf or copper or\r\nsilver sheet, draws thereon cabalistic figures, and utters a mantram\r\n(prayer). Rolling up the leaf or sheet, he ties it to a thread,\r\nand it is worn round the neck in the case of a woman, and round the\r\nloins in the case of a man. Sometimes the magician, taking a thread,\r\nmakes several knots in it, while reciting a mantram. The thread is worn\r\nround the neck or wrist. Or ashes are thrown over a sick person, and\r\nrubbed over the forehead and breast, while a mantram is repeated. Of\r\nmantrams, the following may be cited as examples. \"Salutation to god\r\nwith a thousand locks of matted hair, a thousand hands filling the\r\nthree worlds and overflowing the same. Oh! Goddess mother, out of the\r\nsupreme soul, descend. Oh! Sundara Yaksha (handsome she-devil), Swaha\r\n(an efficacious word).\" \"Salutation to god. He bears a lion on his\r\nhead, or is in the form of a lion in the upper part of his body. In\r\nthe mooladhara sits Garuda, the lord of birds, enemy of serpents,\r\nand vahana (vehicle) of Vishnu. He has Lakshmana to the left, Rama to\r\nthe right, Hanuman in front, Ravana behind, and all around, above,\r\nbelow, everywhere he has Sri Narayana Swaha. Mayst thou watch over\r\nor protect me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans are notorious for the performance of marana kriyakal,\r\nor ceremonies for the killing of enemies. They resort to various\r\nmethods, of which the following are examples:--\r\n\r\n(1) Make an image in wax in the form of your enemy. Take it in your\r\nright hand, and your chain of beads in your left hand. Then burn the\r\nimage with due rites, and it shall slay your enemy in a fortnight.\r\n\r\n(2) Take a human bone from a burial-ground, and recite over it a\r\nthousand times the following mantra:--\"Oh, swine-faced goddess! seize\r\nhim, seize him as a victim. Drink his blood; eat, eat his flesh. Oh,\r\nimage of imminent death! Malayala Bhagavathi.\" The bone, thrown into\r\nthe enemy's house, will cause his ruin.\r\n\r\nOdi or oti cult (breaking the human body) is the name given to a\r\nform of black magic practiced by the Paraiyans, who, when proficient\r\nin it, are believed to be able to render themselves invisible,\r\nor assume the form of a bull, cat, or dog. They are supposed to be\r\nable to entice pregnant women from their houses at dead of night,\r\nto destroy the foetus in the womb, and substitute other substances\r\nfor it; to bring sickness and death upon people; and so to bewitch\r\npeople as to transport them from one place to another. A Paraiya\r\nwho wishes to practice the cult goes to a guru (preceptor), and,\r\nfalling at his feet, humbly requests that he may be admitted into\r\nthe mysteries of the art. The master first tries to dissuade him, but\r\nthe disciple persists in the desire to learn it. He is then tried by\r\nvarious tests as to his fitness. He follows his master to the forests\r\nand lonely places at midnight. The master suddenly makes himself\r\ninvisible, and soon appears before him in the form of a terrible bull,\r\na ferocious dog, or an elephant, when the novice should remain calm and\r\ncollected. He is also required to pass a night or two in the forest,\r\nwhich, according to his firm belief, is full of strange beings howling\r\nhorribly. He should remain unmoved. By these and other trials, he is\r\ntested as to his fitness. Having passed through the various ordeals,\r\nthe guru initiates him into the brotherhood by the performance of puja\r\non an auspicious day to his favourite Nili, called also Kallatikode\r\nNili, through whose aid he works his black art. Flesh and liquor\r\nare consumed, and the disciple is taught how to prepare pilla thilam\r\nand angola thilam, which are the potent medicines for the working of\r\nhis cult. The chief ingredient in the preparation of pilla thilam,\r\nor baby oil, is the sixth or seventh month's foetus of a primipara,\r\nwho should belong to a caste other than that of the sorcerer. Having\r\nsatisfied himself that the omens are favourable, he sets out at\r\nmidnight for the house of the woman selected as his victim, and walks\r\nseveral times round it, waving a cocoanut shell containing a mixture\r\nof lime and turmeric water (gurusi), and muttering mantrams to secure\r\nthe aid of the deity. He also draws yantrams (cabalistic devices)\r\non the ground. The woman is compelled to come out of her house. Even\r\nif the door is locked, she will bang her head against it, and force\r\nit open. The sorcerer leads her to a retired spot, strips her naked,\r\nand tells her to lie flat on the ground. This she does, and a vessel\r\nmade of a gourd (Lagenaria) is placed close to her vagina. The uterus\r\nthen contracts, and the foetus emerges. Sometimes, it is said, the\r\nuterus is filled with some rubbish, and the woman instantly dies. Care\r\nis taken that the foetus does not touch the ground, as the potency\r\nof the drug would thereby be ruined. The foetus is cut to pieces,\r\nand smoked over a fire. It is then placed in a vessel provided with\r\na few holes, below which is another vessel. The two are placed in a\r\nlarger receptacle filled with water, which is heated over a fire. From\r\nthe foetus a liquid exudes, which is collected in the lower vessel. A\r\nhuman skull is then reduced to a fine powder, which is mixed with\r\na portion of the liquid (thilam). With the mixture a mark is made\r\non the forehead of the sorcerer, who rubs some of it over various\r\nparts of his body, and drinks a small quantity of cow-dung water. He\r\nthen thinks that he can assume the form of any animal he likes,\r\nand achieve his object in view, be it murder or bodily injury. The\r\nmagic oil, called angola thilam, is extracted from the angola tree\r\n(Alangium Lamarckii), which bears a very large number of fruits. One\r\nof these is believed to be endowed with life and power of motion, and\r\nto be capable of descending and returning to its original position\r\non dark nights. Its possession can be attained by demons, or by an\r\nexpert watching at the foot of the tree. When it has been secured,\r\nthe extraction of the oil involves the same operations as those for\r\nextracting the pilla thilam, and they must be carried out within seven\r\nhours. A mark made on the forehead with the oil enables its wearer\r\nto achieve his desires, and to transform himself into some animal.\r\n\r\nWhen a person has an enemy whom he wishes to get rid of, the\r\nParaiya magician is consulted, and the name of the enemy given to\r\nhim. Identifying his residence, the Paraiya starts off on a dark\r\nnight, and anyone whom he comes across is at once dispatched with a\r\nblow. The victim comes out of his house in a state of stupefaction,\r\nand the magician puts him to death either by a blow on the head,\r\nor by suffocating him with two sticks applied to his neck. Odi cult\r\nis said to have been practiced till only a few years ago in the rural\r\nparts of the northern part of the State, and in the taluks of Palghat\r\nand Walluvanad in Malabar, and even now it has not entirely died\r\nout. But cases of extracting foetuses and putting persons to death\r\nare not heard of at the present day, owing to the fear of Government\r\nofficials, landlords, and others. The story is current of a Nayar\r\nvillage official, who had two fine bullocks, which a Mappila wished\r\nto purchase. The Nayar, however, was unwilling to part with them. The\r\nMappila accordingly engaged some men to steal the animals. Availing\r\nthemselves of the absence of the Nayar from home, the robbers went\r\nto his house, where they saw a Paraiya and his wife practicing the\r\nodi cult, and compelling a young woman to come out of the house, and\r\nlie on the ground. Catching hold of the Paraiya, the robbers tied\r\nhim to a tree, and secured him. The man and his wife were beaten,\r\nand the would-be robbers rewarded with a present of the bullocks.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyans have no temples of their own, but worship Siva or\r\nKali. According to a legend, in Tretayuga (the second age), a Paraiya\r\nnamed Samvara, and his wife Pulini were living in a forest, and one\r\nday came across a Sivalinga (stone lingam) at a dilapidated temple,\r\nwhich they kept, and worshipped with offerings of flesh, and by\r\nsmearing it with ashes from the burial-ground. On a certain day, no\r\nashes were available, and the woman offered to have her body burnt, so\r\nthat the ashes thereof might be used. With much reluctance her husband\r\nsacrificed her, and performed puja. Then he turned round to offer, as\r\nusual, the prasadam to his wife forgetting that she was dead, and he\r\nwas surprised to see her standing before him, receiving his offering\r\n(prasadam), in flesh and blood. Highly pleased with their conduct,\r\nSiva appeared in person before them, and gave them absolution.\r\n\r\nIn every small village in the rural parts, is a small Bhagavati\r\ntemple, to the deity of which the Paraiyas are devotedly attached,\r\nand look to it for protection in times of cholera, small-pox, or other\r\ncalamities. Kodungallur Bhagavati is their guardian deity, and they\r\ntake part in the festivals (yela) at the shrine. A few days before\r\nthe festival, a piece of cloth is given to the Velichapad (oracle),\r\nwho dresses himself in it, wears a piece of red cloth round his\r\nneck, a peculiar dress around his loins, and ties a few small bells\r\n(chelamba) round his legs. Accompanied by others with drums and fife\r\nand a basket, he goes to every Nayar house daily for seven days, and\r\nreceives presents of paddy, wherewith to defray the expenses of the\r\nfestival. During the celebration thereof, the Velichapad and others\r\ngo to a shed at a distance from the temple (kavu), some dressed up\r\nas ghosts, and dance and sing, to the accompaniment of a band, in\r\nhonour of the deity.\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Paraiyans of Malabar, Mr. T. K. Gopaul Panikkar writes\r\n[70] that \"at certain periods of the year the Paraiyas have to assume\r\nthe garb of an evil deity, with large head-dresses and paintings on the\r\nbody and face, and tender cocoanut leaves hanging loose around their\r\nwaists, all these embellishments being of the rudest patterns. With\r\nfigures such as these, terror-striking in themselves, dancing with\r\ntom-toms sounding and horns blowing, representing the various temple\r\ndeities, they visit the Nair houses, professing thereby to drive off\r\nany evil deities that may be haunting their neighbourhood. After their\r\ndues have been given to them, they go their ways; and, on the last\r\nday, after finishing their house-to-house visits, they collect near\r\ntheir special temples to take part in the vela tamasha (spectacle).\"\r\n\r\nOn the first of every month, a ceremony called kalasam is performed\r\non behalf of the spirits of the departed. Fish, cooked meat, rice,\r\nparched grain, plantain fruits, cocoanuts, toddy, and other things,\r\nare placed on a leaf with a lighted lamp in front of it. A prayer\r\nis then uttered, expressing a hope that the ancestors will partake\r\nof the food which has been procured for them with much difficulty,\r\nand protect the living. One man, becoming inspired, acts the part of\r\nan oracle, and addresses those assembled.\r\n\r\nThe following story is narrated concerning the origin of the\r\nElankunnapuzha temple on the island of Vypin. When some Paraiyas\r\nwere cutting reeds, one of them discovered a remarkable idol and\r\nfell into a trance, under the influence of which he informed the\r\nRaja of Cochin that the idol originally belonged to the Trichendur\r\ntemple in Tinnevelly, and that he must build a shrine for it. This\r\nwas accordingly done, and to the Paraiyan who discovered the idol\r\na daily allowance of rice, and a larger quantity of rice during the\r\nannual temple festival were given. In return, he had to supply cadjan\r\n(palm leaf) umbrellas used at the daily procession, and bamboo baskets\r\nrequired for washing the rice offered to the idol. These allowances\r\nwere received by the Perum or big Paraiyan up to a recent date,\r\neven if he is not receiving them at the present day.\r\n\r\nWhen a Paraiyan woman is delivered, she is secluded for two weeks in\r\na temporary hut erected at a short distance from the dwelling hut. On\r\nthe tenth day, some male member of the family goes to his Brahman or\r\nNayar landlord, from whom he receives some milk, which is sprinkled\r\nover the woman and her infant. She can then come to the verandah of\r\nher home, and remains there for five days, when she is purified by\r\nbathing. The temporary hut is burnt down.\r\n\r\nThe dead are buried, and the corpse, after being laid in the grave,\r\nis covered with a mat.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyas are engaged in the manufacture of wicker baskets,\r\nbamboo mats, and cadjan umbrellas. They also take part in all kinds\r\nof agricultural work, and, when ploughing, will not use buffaloes,\r\nwhich are regarded as unclean beasts, the touch of which necessitates\r\na ceremonial ablution.\r\n\r\nMany Paraiyans become converts to Christianity, and thereby receive\r\na rise in the social scale, and a freedom from the disabilities under\r\nwhich their lowly position in the social scale places them.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 several natives of Malabar were charged with having proceeded,\r\nin company with a Paraiyan, to the house of a pregnant woman, who was\r\nbeaten and otherwise ill-treated, and with having taken the foetus out\r\nof her uterus, and introduced in lieu thereof the skin of a calf and\r\nan earthen pot. The prisoners confessed before the police, but were\r\nacquitted, mainly on the ground that the earthen pot was of a size\r\nwhich rendered it impossible to credit its introduction during life.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 the inhabitants of several villages in Malabar attacked a\r\nvillage of Paraiyans on the alleged ground that deaths of people and\r\ncattle, and the protracted labour of a woman in childbed, had been\r\ncaused by the practice of sorcery by the Paraiyans. They were beaten\r\ninhumanely, with their hands tied behind their backs, so that several\r\ndied. The villagers were driven, bound, into a river, immersed under\r\nwater so as nearly to produce suffocation, and their own children\r\nwere forced to rub sand into their wounds. Their settlement was then\r\nrazed to the ground and they were driven into banishment.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is taken from a note on the Paraiyans of\r\nTravancore by Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. The Paraiyas may be broadly\r\ndivided into two classes, viz., the Tamil-speaking Paraiyas of the east\r\ncoast who are found in considerable numbers in the southern taluks,\r\nand the indigenous Paraiyas, who mostly abound in Central Travancore,\r\navoiding the sea-coast taluks. The latter only are considered here. The\r\ntitles owned by some are Velan conferred upon certain families for\r\ntheir skill in magic; Panikkan; and Muppan. The Paraiyas may be mainly\r\ndivided into four divisions, viz., Vellam (water or jaggery?), Vel\r\n(a lance), Natuvile (middle), and Pani (work). The last is considered\r\nto be the lowest in the social scale, and members thereof are not\r\nadmitted into the houses of the other divisions. One theory of the\r\norigin of the Paraiyas is that they were formerly one with the Pulayas,\r\nfrom whom they separated on account of their eating beef. The Paraiyas\r\nhave a dialect of their own, with which the Pulayas are not familiar,\r\nand which would seem to be worthy of study. In the Keralolpathi, they\r\nare classed as one of the sixteen hill tribes. Concerning their origin\r\nthe following tradition is current. They were originally Brahmans, but,\r\non certain coparceners partitioning the common inheritance, the carcase\r\nof a cow, which was one of the articles to be partitioned, was burnt as\r\nbeing useless. A drop of oil fell from the burning animal on to one of\r\nthe parties, and he licked it up with his tongue. For this act he was\r\ncast out of society, and his descendants, under the name of Paraiyas,\r\nbecame cow-eaters. Pakkanar is said to have been born a Paraiyan,\r\nthough subsequent tradition honours him with Brahmanical parentage.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the Paraiyas are, like those of the Pulayas, mean\r\nthatched sheds, with a couple of cocoanut leaves often serving as\r\nthe wall between one room and another. The village sites are shifted\r\nfrom place to place, according to the exigencies of the inhabitants\r\nthereof. The Paraiyas imbibe freely, and toddy is the drink most\r\nscrupulously prescribed for those who are under a vow. Like the\r\nPulayas, the Paraiyas work in the rice fields and cocoanut gardens,\r\nand are employed in hill cultivation, and the manufacture of\r\nwicker baskets. The sun god is their principal deity, and in his\r\nname all solemn oaths are uttered. It is believed that the Brahman\r\nwho originally became a Paraiya cursed Brahma. To remove the evil\r\neffects of the curse, the sun gave to his descendants as objects of\r\nworship forty-eight thousand gods and eight special deities. A certain\r\nportion of the house is regarded as their own, and to them offerings\r\nof beaten rice and toddy are made on the first of every month, and,\r\nif convenient, every Tuesday and Friday. To these deities small\r\nshrines are dedicated, whereat the priests, on the 28th of Makaram\r\n(January-February), become inspired, and answer questions concerning\r\nthe future put to them by the assembled Paraiyas. The priests are known\r\nas Kaikkarans, and belong ordinarily to the lowest or Pani division.\r\n\r\nAdultery, be it said to the credit of the Paraiyas, is an offence\r\nwhich is severely punished. The man is fined, and the erring woman\r\nhas to jump over a fire which is blazing in a deep pit. This ordeal\r\nrecalls to mind the smarthavicharam of the Namburi Brahman.\r\n\r\nPollution, on the occurrence of the first monthly period, lasts for\r\nseven days. The headmen and elders, called Jajamanmar and Karanavanmar,\r\nare invited to attend, and direct four women of the village to take the\r\ngirl to a hut erected at a considerable distance from the house. This\r\nhut is called pachchakottilil kutiyiruttuka, or seating a person\r\nwithin a hut made of green leaves. On the fourth day the girl has a\r\nbath, and the Kaikkaran waves paddy and flowers in front of her. On\r\nthe morning of the eighth day the shed is burnt down, and the place\r\noccupied by it cleansed with water and cow-dung. The girl bathes,\r\nand is thus rendered free from pollution. A woman, during her menses,\r\nshould remain at a distance of sixty-four feet from others.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyas observe two marriage rites, the tali-kettu and\r\nsambandham. The former ceremony must be performed before the girl\r\nreaches puberty, and the tali-tier is her maternal uncle's or\r\npaternal aunt's son. The Kaikkaran invites at least four headmen to\r\nbe present, and they prescribe the manner in which the ceremony is\r\nto be performed. The auspicious time for the marriage celebration is\r\nfixed by a Kaniyan (astrologer), and, on the day before the wedding,\r\nthe Kaikkaran invites the Paraiyas of the village to be present at\r\nthe tunniruttal, or erection of the pandal (booth). All those who\r\nattend are presented with betel, tobacco, and a liberal allowance of\r\ntoddy. The next item in the programme is the vachchorukkal, or placing\r\nbeaten and cooked rice, flowers, toddy, and other things in the pandal,\r\nunder the direction of the Kaikkaran. Some of the assembled males\r\nthen sing a song called maranpattu, or song of the god of love. The\r\nbride then becomes inspired, and dances, while the sorcerer rolls\r\nout mystic hymns. On the following morning, the bridegroom goes to\r\nthe home of the bride in procession, and is led to a wooden seat\r\nin the centre of the pandal, where he is joined by the bride, who\r\nseats herself on his left. He then ties the minnu (marriage badge)\r\nround her neck, and retires with her to the maniyara, or bedroom,\r\nwhere they remain together for some minutes. On the final day of the\r\nceremonies, the bride is bathed.\r\n\r\nWhen a Kaikkaran dies, a conch shell is buried with the corpse. Once\r\na year, and on some new moon day, offerings are made to all the\r\ndeceased ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe Paraiyas have a dramatic entertainment called Paraiyan Kali,\r\nin which the performer plays his part, standing on a mortar, to the\r\naccompaniment of music.\r\n\r\nParaiyas are required to keep at a distance of 128 feet from Brahmans,\r\ni.e., double the distance required of a Pulaya. But they will not\r\nreceive food at the hands of the Pulayas.\r\n\r\nIn a further note on the \"Paraiya Caste in Travancore,\" the\r\nRev. S. Mateer writes as follows. [71] \"They were formerly bought and\r\nsold like cattle, starved, flogged 'like buffaloes,' made to work\r\nall day for a little rice, and kept at a distance as polluted; and\r\nthey still are in a position of subservience and deep degradation,\r\nnot vitally differing from that of the Pulayas and Vedars. One\r\nparticular characteristic of this caste, and most offensive to\r\nothers, is that they eat the flesh of bullocks and cows left dead by\r\nthe roadside. They cut it up, and bear it away; what they leave the\r\nvultures and dogs devour. This disgusting practice is to a great extent\r\ndisappearing among the Christian castes. The Paraiyas of Nevandrum\r\n(Trivandrum?) district live in clusters of huts, and eat the putrid\r\nflesh of dead cattle, tigers, and other animals. Their girls are\r\n'married' when very young for mere form to their cousins, but, when\r\ngrown up, are selected by others, who give them a cloth, and live\r\nwith them in concubinage. Cases of polygamy occur, and sometimes also\r\nof polyandry. They eat the seed of Ochlandra Rheedii, which abounds\r\nin an unusually dry season, as does also the bamboo. Jungle roots,\r\nland crabs, and snails form part of their food. Some of them have\r\nenough of rice at harvest time, but seldom at any other period of the\r\nyear. They are zealous devil worshippers, their chief demons being\r\nMadan (the cow one), Rathachamandy Mallan (the giant) and Muvaratta\r\nMallan, Karunkali (black kali), Chavus (departed spirits), Bhutham,\r\nMantramurtti, and other Murttis (ghosts), with many other evil beings,\r\nto whom groves and altars are dedicated. The souls of their deceased\r\nancestors are called Marutta (ghosts), for whose worship young cocoanut\r\nleaves are tied at the bottom of a tree, and a small shed is erected on\r\npoles, and decorated with garlands of flowers. Presents of cocoanuts,\r\nparched rice, and arrack are offered, and cocks killed in sacrifice. In\r\nthe devil-dancing they use clubs and rattans, bells, handkerchiefs,\r\nand cloths dedicated to their deities. Other castes generally dread\r\nincurring the displeasure and malice of these deities. Sudras and\r\nShanars frequently employ the Paraiya devil-dancers and sorcerers to\r\nexorcise demons, search for and dig out magical charms buried in the\r\nearth by enemies, and counteract their enchantments; and, in cases\r\nof sickness, send for them to beat the drum, and so discover what\r\ndemon has caused the affliction, and what is to be done to remove\r\nit. Sometimes a present of a cow is given for those services. These\r\npretended sorcerers are slightly acquainted with a few medicines,\r\nprofess to cure snake-bite, and can repeat some tales of the Hindu\r\ngods. They also profess to discover thieves, who sometimes indeed\r\nthrough fear actually take ill, confess, and restore the property. One\r\npriest whom I knew used to pretend that he had a 'bird devil' in his\r\npossession, by which he could cast out other devils. On one occasion,\r\nhowever, when he made the attempt in the presence of a large concourse\r\nof Sudras and others, he utterly failed, and hurt himself severely by\r\nbeating his chest with a cocoanut and leaping into the fire. He soon\r\nafter resolved to abandon this course of life, and became a Christian.\r\n\r\n\"After the wife's confinement, the husband is starved for seven days,\r\neating no cooked rice or other food, only roots and fruits, and\r\ndrinking only arrack or toddy. The shed, in which she was confined,\r\nis burnt down.\r\n\r\n\"In cases of sickness, the diviner is first consulted as to its\r\ncause. He names a demon, and offerings are demanded of rice, fruits,\r\nflowers, and fowls. Being daily supplied with these articles, the\r\ndiviner spreads cow-dung thinly over a small space in the yard,\r\nwhere he places the offerings on three plantain leaves, invokes the\r\npresence of the demons, dances and repeats mantras, looking towards the\r\neast. He catches the demon that is supposed to come in an old piece of\r\ncloth filled with flowers and parched rice, and carries both demon and\r\nofferings into the jungle, where, again preparing a spot as before,\r\ntwo torches are set, the food arranged, and, after further mantras,\r\na fowl is sacrificed. He takes the whole afterwards for himself, gets\r\na good meal, and is also paid twelve chuckrams (small silver coins)\r\nfor the service.\r\n\r\n\"In cases of small-pox, one who has had this disease is called in to\r\nattend. He takes the patient to a temporary hut in a lonely place,\r\nand is well paid, and supplied with all that he requires. Through\r\nfear, none of the relatives will go near. Should the patient die, the\r\nattendant buries him on the spot, performing the ceremonies himself,\r\nthen comes to the house, repeats mantras, and waves his hands round\r\nthe head of each to remove further alarm. If a woman with child dies,\r\nshe is buried at a great distance away. Occasionally the remains of\r\nan aged man are burnt on a funeral pile, as being more honourable\r\nthan burial, and providing some merit to the soul.\r\n\r\n\"Let us pay a visit to one of the rural hamlets of the Kolam Paraiyans,\r\na considerable sub-division of this caste. The cattle manure is\r\nsaved, but handed over to the Sudra farmers. The Paraiyas plant a\r\nfew trees around their settlement as otti (mortgage) and kurikanam\r\n(a kind of tenant right), then pay a sum to the Sudra landowner to\r\npermit them to enjoy the produce, as it is so difficult for them\r\nto get waste lands registered in their own name. Some have cleared\r\nlands, and possess a few cocoanut and betel-nut palms, mangoes,\r\netc. They may have a few cattle also, and let out a milch cow to the\r\nshepherds at one rupee per month. They grow some vegetables, etc.,\r\nin waste valley lands temporarily cleared and cultivated. They work\r\nin the rice fields, sowing, planting, and reaping, for which they are\r\npaid in paddy. During the slack season they work at making mats of\r\nOchlandra Rheedii, for which the men bring loads of the reeds from\r\nthe hills, and the women do the work of plaiting. This art they are\r\nsaid to have learnt from the Kanikar hill-men.\r\n\r\n\"Some Paraiyas in Nanjinad have enjoyed ancestral property for six\r\ngenerations, and a few still have good properties. Titles were\r\npurchased for money of the Rajas of Travancore, e.g., Sambavan,\r\nan old name for Pandi Paraiyas. The Raja gave to such a headman a\r\ncane, and authority to claim a double allowance of betel, etc. He,\r\nhowever, had in his turn to give double at funerals and festivals to\r\nhis visitors. This head Paraiyan would be met with drums and marks of\r\nhonour by his people, and the arrangement would enable the Government\r\nto rule the Paraiyas more easily. It is said that some Raja, fleeing\r\nin war, hid himself in Paraiya huts at Changankadei, and was thereby\r\nsaved, for which he gave them a small grant of land producing a few\r\nfanams annually, which they still enjoy. They have a tradition that,\r\nin M.E. 102 (A.D. 927), one Vanji Mannan Raja granted privileges to\r\nParaiyas. During the war with Tippu, proclamation was made that every\r\nParaiyan in this district must have a Nayar or master, and belong to\r\nsome one or other. All who were not private property would be made\r\nslaves of the Sirkar (Government), which was greatly dreaded on account\r\nof the merciless oppression, and obliged to cut grass for the troops,\r\nand do other services. Many, therefore, became nominally slaves to some\r\nrespectable man, asking it as a kindness to free them from Government\r\nslavery. Several respectable families begged the Namburi high priest,\r\nvisiting Suchindram and other temples, to call them his slaves,\r\nfor which they paid him one fanam a head per annum. This payment is\r\nstill kept up. This priest conferred upon them additional benefits,\r\nfor in their troubles and oppressions, he wrote to the Government,\r\nrequiring from them justice and proper treatment. The slaves of\r\nthe Namburi would also be treated with consideration on account of\r\nhis sacred position and rank. These families, 'Potty slaves,' still\r\nintermarry only among themselves, as in this case the wife could not\r\nbe claimed by a different owner from the husband's.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, as to the Paraiyas of North Travancore. Their condition seems\r\nlowest of all, as they enter further into the Malayalam country, and\r\nenjoy fewer opportunities of escape from caste degradation and from\r\nbitter servitude. 'Their own tradition,' the Rev. G. Matthan writes,\r\n[72] 'has it that they were a division of the Brahmans, who were\r\nentrapped into a breach of caste by their enemies, through making them\r\neat beef. They eat carrion and other loathsome things. The carcases\r\nof all domestic animals are claimed by them as belonging to them by\r\nright. They frequently poison cows, and otherwise kill them for the\r\nsake of their flesh. They are also charged with kidnapping women of\r\nthe higher castes, whom they are said to treat in the most brutal\r\nmanner. It is their custom to turn robbers in the month of February,\r\nin which month they pretend the wrong was done them, to break into\r\nthe houses of the Brahmans and Nairs, and to carry away their women,\r\nchildren, and property, to which they are actuated more by motives\r\nof revenge than of interest, and to justify which they plead the\r\ninjury their caste had received from these parties. In former times,\r\nthey appear to have been able to perpetrate these cruelties almost\r\nwith impunity, from the fear of which the people still betray great\r\nuneasiness, though the custom has now grown into disuse.'\"\r\n\r\nParasaivan.--A title of Occhans, who are Saivites, and priests at\r\ntemples of Grama Devatas (village deities). In the Malayalam country\r\nParasava occurs as a title of Variyar, a section of Ambalavasi. The\r\nword indicates the son of a Brahman by a Sudra woman.\r\n\r\nParava.--The Tulu-speaking Paravas of South Canara are, like the\r\nNalkes and Pombadas, devil-dancers, and are further employed in\r\nthe manufacture of baskets and umbrellas. Socially, they occupy a\r\nhigher position than the Nalkes, but rank below the Pombadas. The\r\nbhuthas (devils) whose disguise they assume are Kodamanitaya and the\r\nBaiderukalu, who may not be represented by Nalkes; and they have\r\nno objection to putting on the disguise of other bhuthas. Paravas\r\nare engaged for all kinds of devil-dances when Nalkes are not\r\navailable. (See Nalke.)\r\n\r\nParavan.--Concerning the origin of the Parava fishing community of the\r\nsouth-east coast, the following legends are current. [73] The author of\r\nthe Historia Ecclesiastica (published in Tamil at Tranquebar in 1735)\r\nidentifies them with the Parvaim of the Scriptures, and adds that,\r\nin the time of Solomon, they were famous among those who made voyages\r\nby sea; but it does not appear that there is any solid foundation\r\nfor this hypothesis. It is the general belief among the Paravas that\r\ntheir original country was Ayodhya, or Oudh; and it appears that,\r\npreviously to the war of Mahabharata, they inhabited the territory\r\nbordering on the river Yamuna or Jumna. At present they are chiefly\r\nfound in the seaport towns of the Tinnevelly district in the south\r\nof India, and also in some of the provinces on the north-west coast\r\nof Ceylon. With regard to their origin, there is a variety as well\r\nas discordancy of opinions. Some of the Tantras represent them to be\r\ndescended from a Brahman by a Sudra woman, while the Jatibedi Nul\r\n(a work of some celebrity among the Tamils) states them to be the\r\noffspring of a Kurava (or basket-maker) begotten clandestinely on a\r\nfemale of the Chetty (or merchant) tribe. But the Paravas have among\r\nthemselves quite a different tradition concerning their origin, which\r\nis founded on mythological fable. They relate that their progenitors\r\nwere of the race Varuna (god of the sea), and on the occasion,\r\nwhen Siva had called Kartikeya (god of arms) into existence, for\r\ndestroying the overwhelming power of the Asuras (evil spirits), they\r\nsprang up with him from the sacred lake Sarawana, and were like him\r\nnursed by the constellation Kartika. At the close of the last kalpa,\r\nwhen the whole earth was covered with a deluge, they constructed a\r\ndhoni or boat, and by it escaped the general destruction; and, when\r\ndry land appeared, they settled on the spot where the dhoni rested;\r\nhence it is called Dhonipura, or the city of the boat. The Paravas\r\nwere once a very powerful people, and no doubt derived much of their\r\nascendancy over other tribes from their knowledge of navigation. They\r\nhad a succession of kings among them, distinguished by the title of\r\nAdiyarasen, some of whom seem to have resided at Uttara Kosamangay,\r\ncalled at that time the city of Mangay, a famous place of Hindu\r\npilgrimage in the neighbourhood of Ramnad. In the Purana entitled\r\nValevisu Puranam we meet with the following fable. Parvati, the\r\nconsort of Siva, and her son Kartikeya, having offended the deity\r\nby revealing some ineffable mystery, were condemned to quit their\r\ncelestial mansions, and pass through an infinite number of mortal\r\nforms, before they could be re-admitted to the divine presence. On\r\nthe entreaty of Parvati, however, they were allowed, as a mitigation\r\nof the punishment, each to undergo but one transmigration. And, as\r\nabout this time, Triambaka, King of the Paravas, and Varuna Valli\r\nhis consort were making tapas (acts of devotion) to obtain issue,\r\nParvati condescended to be incarnated as their daughter under the\r\nname of Tiryser Madente. Her son Kartikeya, transforming himself\r\ninto a fish, was roaming for some time in the north sea. It appears,\r\nhowever, that he left the north, and made his way into the south sea,\r\nwhere, growing to an immense size, he attacked the vessels employed\r\nby the Paravas in their fisheries, and threatened to destroy their\r\ntrade. Whereupon the King Triambaka made a public declaration that\r\nwhoever would catch the fish should have his daughter to wife. Siva,\r\nnow assuming the character of a Parava, caught the fish, and became\r\nre-united to his consort. In that section of the Mahabharata entitled\r\nAdiparva it is said that the King of the Paravas, who resided on the\r\nbanks of the Jumna, having found an infant girl in the belly of a fish,\r\nadopted her as his own daughter, giving her the name of Machchakindi,\r\nand that, when she grew up, she was employed, as was customary with the\r\nfemales of the Parava tribe, to ferry passengers over the river. On\r\na certain day, the sage Parasara having chanced to meet her at the\r\nferry, she became with child by him, and was subsequently delivered of\r\na son, the famous Vyasa who composed the Puranas. Her great personal\r\ncharms afterwards induced King Santanu of the lunar race to admit her\r\nto his royal bed, and by him she became the mother of Vichitravirya,\r\nthe grandsire of the Pandavas and Kauravas, whose contentions for the\r\nthrone of Hastinapura form the subject of the Mahabharata. Hence the\r\nParavas boast of being allied to the lunar race, and call themselves\r\naccordingly, besides displaying at their wedding feasts the banners\r\nand emblems peculiar to it. In the drama of Alliarasany, who is\r\nsupposed to have resided at Kudremalle on the north-west coast of\r\nCeylon, the Paravas act a conspicuous part. We find them employed by\r\nthe princess in fishing for pearls off the coast, and that under a\r\nsevere penalty they were obliged to furnish her with ten kalams of\r\npearls every season.\r\n\r\nIt is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that \"there are\r\nin reality three castes which answer to the name Paravan, and\r\nwhich speak Tamil, Malayalam, and Canarese respectively. Probably\r\nall three are descended from the Tamil Paravans or Paratavans. The\r\nTamil Paravans are fishermen on the sea coast. Their head-quarters is\r\nTuticorin, and their headman is called Talavan. They are mostly Native\r\nChristians. They claim to be Kshatriyas of the Pandyan line of kings,\r\nand will eat only in the houses of Brahmans. The Malayalam Paravans\r\nare shell collectors, lime burners and gymnasts, and their women act\r\nas midwives. Their titles are Kurup, Varakurup, and Nurankurup (nuru,\r\nlime). The Canarese Paravas are umbrella-makers and devil-dancers.\" It\r\nhas been suggested that the west coast Paravas are the descendants\r\nof those who fled from Tinnevelly, in order to avoid the oppression\r\nof the Muhammadans.\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1871, the Paravas are summed up as being a\r\nfishing caste on the Madura and Tinnevelly coast, who \"were found by\r\nthe Portuguese, on their arrival in India, to be groaning under the\r\nMuhammadan yoke, and were assisted by the Portuguese on condition of\r\ntheir becoming Christians. This general conversion, for political\r\nends, explains why the fishing population of the present day along\r\nthe south-east coast is to a considerable extent Roman Catholic.\" It\r\nis noted by Mr. S. P. Rice [74] that the fishermen \"who live in the\r\nextreme south are devout Catholics, and have preserved the Portuguese\r\nnames by which their fathers were baptized into the Church, so that,\r\nincongruous as it sounds, Jose Fernandez and Maria Santiago are but\r\nhumble folk, catching fish in a primitive way, with no more clothing\r\non than a small loin cloth and a picture of the Virgin.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the Paravas, Baldæus [75] writes as follows. \"The kingdom of\r\nTrevancor borders upon that of Coulang: All along the Sea-shore inhabit\r\nthe Paruas, who being for the most part Christians, you see the Shore\r\nall along as far as Comoryn, and even beyond it to Tutecoryn, full of\r\nlittle Churches, some of Wood, others of Stone. These People owe their\r\nConversion to Franciscus Xaverius, he being the first who planted\r\nthe Principles of Christianity among them; they being so much taken\r\nwith the reasonableness of the Ten Commandments, that they receiv'd\r\nBaptism in great numbers, tho an accidental Quarrel between a Parua\r\nand a Mahometan prov'd a strong Motive to their Conversion.... The\r\nParuas being sorely oppress'd by the Mahometans, one John de Crus,\r\na Native of Malabar, but who had been in Portugal, and honourably\r\ntreated by John, the then king of Portugal, advised them to seek for\r\nAid at Cochin against the Moors, and to receive Baptism. Accordingly\r\nsome of the chief Men among them (call'd Patangatays in their Language)\r\nwere sent upon that Errand to Cochin, where being kindly receiv'd,\r\nthey (in honour of him who had given His Advice) took upon them\r\nthe Sirname of Crus, a name still retain'd by most Persons of Note\r\namong the Paruas. In short, being deliver'd from the Moorish Yoke,\r\nand the Pearl-fishery (which formerly belong'd to them) restor'd to\r\nthe right Owners, above 20,000 of them receiv'd Baptism.\"\r\n\r\n\"The commencement of the Roman Catholic Mission in Tinnevelly,\"\r\nBishop Caldwell writes, [76] \"dates from 1532, when certain Paravas,\r\nrepresentatives of the Paravas or fishing caste, visited Cochin for\r\nthe purpose of supplicating the aid of the Portuguese against their\r\nMuhammadan oppressors, and were baptized there by Michael Vaz,\r\nVicar-General of the Bishop of Goa. The same ecclesiastic, with\r\nother priests, accompanied the fleet which sailed for the purpose\r\nof chastising the Muhammadans, and, as soon as that object was\r\naccomplished, set about baptizing the Paravas all along the coast,\r\nin accordance with the agreement into which their representatives\r\nhad entered. The entire Parava caste adopted the religion of their\r\nPortuguese deliverers and most of them received baptism. Some,\r\nhowever, did not receive baptism for some cause till Xavier's time,\r\nten years afterwards. Xavier, on his arrival in the south, could\r\nnot speak Tamil, and spent some months in committing to memory Tamil\r\ntranslations of the Creed, Lord's Prayer, Ave Maria, and Decalogue. He\r\nthen proceeded to visit all the villages of the coast, bell in hand,\r\nto collect the inhabitants, and gave them Christian instruction. The\r\nParavas thus christianised--called generally at that time the Comorin\r\nChristians--inhabited thirty villages, and numbered, according to the\r\nmost credible account, twenty thousand souls. These villages extended\r\nall the way along the coast at irregular intervals from Cape Comorin to\r\nthe island promontory of Ramesvaram, if not beyond. It does not appear\r\nthat any village in the interior joined in the movement.\" \"It appears,\"\r\nMr. Casie Chitty states, \"that the Portuguese treated the Paravas\r\nwith great kindness, permitted intermarriages, and even allowed them\r\nto assume their surnames, so that we find among them many Da Limas,\r\nDa Cruzs, Da Andrados, Da Canhas, etc. They gave the chief of the\r\nParavas the title of Dom, and allowed him the exclusive right of\r\nwearing a gold chain with a cross as a badge of nobility. [The name\r\nof a recent hereditary chief or Jati Talaivan or Talaivamore of the\r\nParavas was Gabriel de Cruz Lazarus Motha Vas.] As soon as the Dutch\r\ntook possession of Tutocoryn (Tuticorin) and other adjacent towns\r\nwhere the Paravas are found, they employed Dr. Baldæus and a few other\r\nministers of their persuasion to suppress the Roman Catholic faith,\r\nand to persuade the Paravas to adopt their own in its stead; but in\r\nthis they met with a total failure, and were once very nearly bringing\r\non a general revolt. Notwithstanding the intolerance of the Dutch\r\nwith regard to the Romish Church, the Paravas still remember them with\r\ngratitude, as they afforded them the means of extensive livelihood by\r\nestablishing in their principal town (Tutocoryn) a public manufactory\r\nof cloth, and thus maintaining a considerable working capital.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the history of the Paravas, and their connection with\r\nthe pearl-fisheries on the Indian side of the Gulf of Manaar, much\r\ninformation is given by Mr. J. Hornell, [77] from whose account\r\nthe following extracts are taken. \"When the Portuguese rounded Cape\r\nComorin, they found the pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Manaar in the\r\nhands of the Paravas, whom tradition shows to have had control of\r\nthis industry from time immemorial. Of the origin of these people\r\nwe know extremely little. We know, however, that in the old days,\r\nfrom 600 B.C. and for 1,500 years or more thereafter, the country\r\nnow comprehended in the districts of Madura and Tinnevelly formed the\r\ngreat Tamil kingdom of Pandya. And, in the old Tamil work called the\r\nKalveddu, the position of the pearl-fishing caste to this monarchy is\r\nincidentally mentioned in the following extract: 'Vidanarayanen Cheddi\r\nand the Paravu men who fished pearls by paying tribute to Alliyarasani,\r\ndaughter of Pandya, king of Madura, who went on a voyage, experienced\r\nbad weather in the sea, and were driven to the shores of Lanka, where\r\nthey founded Karainerkai and Kutiraimalai. Vidanarayanen Cheddi had\r\nthe treasures of his ship stored there by the Paravas, and established\r\npearl fisheries at Kadalihilapam and Kallachihilapam, and introduced\r\nthe trees which change iron into gold.' In the Maduraik-kanchi the\r\nParavas are described as being most powerful in the country round\r\nKorkai. 'Well fed on fish and armed with bows, their hordes terrified\r\ntheir enemies by their dashing valour.' The Maduraik-kanchi describes\r\nKorkai as the chief town in the country of Parathavar and the seat\r\nof the pearl fishery, with a population consisting chiefly of pearl\r\ndivers and chank cutters. [78] When the Pandyan kingdom was powerful,\r\nthe Paravas had grants of certain rights from the monarchy, paying\r\ntribute from the produce of the fisheries, and receiving protection\r\nand immunity from taxation in return. The conditions under which the\r\nParavas lived at the opening of the sixteenth century are graphically\r\nset forth in a report, dated 19th December, 1669, written by Van Reede\r\nand Laurens Pyh, respectively Commandant of the coast of Malabar and\r\nCanara and senior merchant and Chief of the sea-ports of Madura. Under\r\nthe protection of those Rajas there lived a people, which had come to\r\nthese parts from other countries [79]--they are called Paravas--they\r\nlived a seafaring life, gaining their bread by fishing and by diving\r\nfor pearls; they had purchased from the petty Rajas small streaks\r\nof the shore, along which they settled and built villages, and they\r\ndivided themselves as their numbers progressively increased. In these\r\npurchased lands they lived under the rule of their own headmen, paying\r\nto the Rajas only an annual present, free from all other taxes which\r\nbore upon the natives so heavily, looked upon as strangers, exempt\r\nfrom tribute or subjection to the Rajas, having a chief of their own\r\nelection, whose descendants are still called kings of the Paravas,\r\nand who drew a revenue from the whole people, which in process of\r\ntime has spread itself from Quilon to Bengal. Their importance and\r\npower have not been reduced by this dispersion, for they are seen\r\nat every pearl fishery (on which occasions the Paravas assemble\r\ntogether) surpassing in distinction, dignity and outward honours all\r\nother persons there. The pearl fishery was the principal resource and\r\nexpedient from which the Paravas obtained a livelihood, but as from\r\ntheir residence so near the sea they had no manner of disposing of\r\ntheir pearls, they made an agreement with the Rajas that a market day\r\nshould be proclaimed throughout their dominions, when merchants might\r\nsecurely come from all parts of India, and at which the divers and\r\nsutlers necessary to furnish provisions for the multitude might also\r\nmeet; and, as this assemblage would consist of two different races,\r\nnamely, the Paravas and subjects of the Rajas, as well as strangers and\r\ntravellers, two kinds of guards and tribunals were to be established\r\nto prevent all disputes and quarrels arising during this open market,\r\nevery man being subject to his own judge, and his case being decided\r\nby him; all payments were then also divided among the headmen of the\r\nParavas, who were the owners of that fishery, and who hence became\r\nrich and powerful; they had weapons and soldiers of their own, with\r\nwhich they were able to defend themselves against the violence of\r\nthe Rajas or their subjects. The Moors who had spread themselves over\r\nIndia, and principally along the coasts of Madura, were strengthened\r\nby the natives professing Muhammadanism, and by the Arabs, Saracens,\r\nand the privateers of the Sammoryn, [80] and they began also to take\r\nto pearl-diving as an occupation, but being led away by ill-feeling\r\nand hope of gain, they often attempted to outreach the Paravas,\r\nsome of whom even they gained to their party and to their religion,\r\nby which means they obtained so much importance, that the Rajas joined\r\nthemselves to the Moors, anticipating great advantages from the trade\r\nwhich they carried on, and from their power at sea; and thus the\r\nParavas were oppressed, although they frequently rose against their\r\nadversaries, but they always got the worst of it, until at last in a\r\npearl fishery at Tutucoryn, having purposely raised a dispute, they\r\nfell upon the Moors, and killed some thousands of them, burnt their\r\nvessels, and remained masters of the country, though much in fear that\r\nthe Moors, joined by the pirates of Calicut, would rise against them\r\nin revenge. The Portuguese arrived about this time with one ship at\r\nTutucoryn; the Paravas requested them for assistance, and obtained\r\na promise of it, on conditions that they should become Christians;\r\nthis they generally agreed to, and, having sent Commissioners with\r\nsome of the Portuguese to Goa, they were received under the protection\r\nof that nation, and their Commissioners returned with priests, and a\r\nnaval force conveying troops, on which all the Paravas of the seven\r\nports were baptized, accepted as subjects of the King of Portugal,\r\nand they dwindled thus from having their own chiefs and their own\r\nlaws into subordination to priests and Portuguese, who however\r\nsettled the rights and privileges of the Paravas so firmly that\r\nthe Rajas no longer dared interfere with them, or attempt to impede\r\nor abridge their prerogative; on the contrary they were compelled\r\nto admit of separate laws for the Paravas from those which bound\r\ntheir own subjects. The Portuguese kept for themselves the command\r\nat sea, the pearl fisheries, the sovereignty over the Paravas, their\r\nvillages and harbours, whilst the Naick of Madura, who was a subject\r\nof the King of the Carnatic, made himself master at this time of the\r\nlands about Madura, and in a short time afterwards of all the lower\r\ncountries from Cape Comoryn to Tanjore, expelling and rooting out all\r\nthe princes and land proprietors, who were living and reigning there;\r\nbut, on obtaining the sovereignty of all these countries, he wished to\r\nsubject the Paravas to his authority, in which attempt he was opposed\r\nby the Portuguese, who often, not being powerful enough effectually\r\nto resist, left the land with the priests and Paravas, and went to\r\nthe islands of Manaar and Jaffnapatam, from whence they sent coasting\r\nvessels along the Madura shores, and caused so much disquiet that the\r\nrevenue was ruined, trade circumscribed, and almost annihilated, for\r\nwhich reasons the Naick himself was obliged to solicit the Portuguese\r\nto come back again. The Political Government of India, perceiving the\r\ngreat benefit of the pearl fishery, appointed in the name of the King\r\nof Portugal military chiefs and captains to superintend it, leaving\r\nthe churches and their administration to the priests. Those captains\r\nobtained from the fisheries each time a profit of 6,000 rix-dollars\r\nfor the king, leaving the remainder of the income from them for the\r\nParavas; but, seeing they could not retain their superiority in that\r\nmanner over the people, which was becoming rich, luxurious, drunken,\r\nwith prosperity, and with the help of the priests, who protected them,\r\nthreatening the captains, which often occasioned great disorders,\r\nthe latter determined to build a fort for the king at Tutucoryn,\r\nwhich was the chief place of all the villages; but the priests who\r\nfeared by this to lose much of their consequence as well as of their\r\nrevenue, insisted that, if such a measure was proceeded with, they\r\nwould all be ruined, on which account they urged on the people to\r\ncommit irregularities, and made the Paravas fear that the step was a\r\npreliminary one to the making all of them slaves; and they therefore\r\nraised such hindrances to the work that it never could be completed.\r\n\r\n\"The Paravas,\" Mr. Hornell continues, \"although the original holders of\r\nthe fishery rights, had begun, prior to the arrival of the Portuguese,\r\nto feel the competition of the restless Muhammadan settlers on the\r\ncoast, who, coming, as many must have done, from the coast of the\r\nPersian Gulf, knew already all there was to know of pearl-fishing. The\r\ndescendants of these Arabs and their proselytes, known as Moros to\r\nthe Portuguese, are the Moormen or Lubbais of to-day. Their chief\r\nsettlement was Kayal, a town situated near the mouth of the river\r\nTambrapurni, and which in Marco Polo's time (1290-91) was a great\r\nand noble city. It shared with Tuticorin for fully 500 years the\r\nhonour of being one of the two great pearl markets of the coast--the\r\none being the Moor, the other the Parava, head-quarters.... Menezes,\r\nwriting in 1622, states that for many years the fisheries had become\r\nextinct because of the great poverty into which the Paravas had\r\nfallen. Tuticorin, and the sovereignty of the pearl banks and of the\r\nParavas, passed to the Dutch in 1658.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the pearl fishery, 1708, the following entries occur\r\nin the list of free stones according to ancient customs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    96 1/2 to the Naick of Madura--4 Xtian, 92 1/2 Moorish;\r\n    10 to Head Moorman of Cailpatnam--5 Xtian, 5 Moorish.\r\n    60 to Theuver--60 Moorish.\r\n    185 to the Pattangatyns of this coast--all Xtian stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The 185 stones,\" Mr. Hornell writes, \"given to the Pattangatyns or\r\nheadmen of the Paravas was in the nature of remuneration to these men\r\nfor assistance in inspecting the banks, in guarding any oyster banks\r\ndiscovered, in recruiting divers, and in superintending operations\r\nduring the course of the fishery.... In 1889, the Madras Government\r\nrecorded its appreciation of the assistance rendered by the Jati\r\nTalaivan, and directed that his privilege of being allowed the take\r\nof two boats be continued. Subsequently, in 1891, the Government,\r\nwhile confirming the general principle of privilege remuneration to the\r\nJati Talaivan, adopted the more satisfactory regulation of placing the\r\nextent of the remuneration upon the basis of a sliding scale, allowing\r\nhim but one boat when the Government boats numbered 30 or less, two for\r\n31 to 60 boats, three for 61 to 90 boats employed, and so on in this\r\nratio. The value of the Jati Talaivan's two privilege boats in the\r\n1890 fishery was Rs. 1,424, in that of 1900 only Rs. 172.\" The Jadi\r\nTalaivan is said to have been denominated by the Dutch the prince of\r\nthe seven havens. It is noted in the pearl fishery report, 1900, that\r\n\"the Paravas are a constant source of trouble, both on the banks and in\r\nthe kottoo (shed), where they were constantly being caught concealing\r\noysters, which of course were always confiscated. Only one Arab was\r\ncaught doing this, and his companions abused him for disgracing them.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Casie Chitty, the Paravas are divided into thirteen\r\nclasses, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Headmen.\r\n    Dealers in cloth.\r\n    Divers for corals.\r\n    Sailors.\r\n    Divers for pearl-oysters.\r\n    Divers for chanks.\r\n    Packers of cloth.\r\n    Fishers who catch tortoises (turtles).\r\n    Fishers who catch porpoises.\r\n    Fishers who catch sharks and other fish.\r\n    Palanquin bearers.\r\n    Peons, who wait about the person of the Chief.\r\n    Fishers, who catch crabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Canon A. Margoschis that the Parava females are\r\nfamous for the excessive dilatation of the lobes of the ears, and for\r\nwearing therein the heaviest and most expensive gold ear jewels made of\r\nsovereigns. Ordinary jewels are said to cost Rs. 200, but heavy jewels\r\nare worth Rs. 1,000 and even more. The longer the ears, the more jewels\r\ncan be used, and this appears to be the rationale of elongated ears.\r\n\r\nIn a recent account of a Parava wedding in high life, I read [81]\r\nthat \"the bride and bridegroom proceeded to the church at the head\r\nof an imposing procession, with music and banners. The service, which\r\nwas fully choral, was conducted by a priest from their own community,\r\nafter which the newly wedded couple went in procession to the residence\r\nof the Jati Talavamore, being escorted by their distinguished host\r\nin person. The Jati Talavamore, who wore a picturesque, if somewhat\r\nantiquated, robe, rode in a gorgeously upholstered palanquin,\r\nwith banners, trophies, elephants, and other emblems of his high\r\noffice. The bride, who was resplendent with diamonds, was becomingly\r\nattired in a purple Benares sari with gold floral designs, and wore\r\na superb kincob bodice.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Paravans of Travancore, Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar writes\r\nthat \"they are found in most taluks of the State. The title sometimes\r\nused by them is Kuruppu. The Paravans of Chengannur and Tiruvella call\r\nthemselves Chakka, a word supposed by the castemen to be derived from\r\nslaghya or praiseworthy, but perhaps more correctly from Chakku, the\r\nbasket carried by them in their hands. The Paravans are divided into\r\nnumerous sections. In the south, the Tamil-speaking division follows\r\nthe makkathayam, while all the Malayalam-speaking sections follow\r\nthe marumakathayam law of inheritance. There is also a difference\r\nin the dress and ornaments of the two sections, the former adopting\r\nthe fashion of the east coast, and the latter that of the west. The\r\nTravancore Paravas are really one with the Tamil-speaking Paravas of\r\nthe east coast. While most of them became converts to Christianity,\r\nin Travancore they have tried to preserve their separate existence,\r\nas they had already spread into the interior of the country before the\r\nproselytism of St. Xavier had made its enduring mark on the sea-coast\r\nvillages. There is a curious legend about the settlement of the Chakkas\r\nin Central Travancore. Formerly, it would appear, they were Sudras,\r\nbut, for some social offence committed by them, they were outcasted by\r\nthe Edappalli chieftain. They were once great devotees of Sri Krishna,\r\nthe lord of Tiruvaranmulai in the Tiruvella taluk. The Paravas say\r\nfurther that they are descended from a high-caste woman married to an\r\nIzhava. The word Parava is accordingly derived from para, which in\r\nSanskrit means foreign. The Paravas engage in various occupations,\r\nof which the most important in Central Travancore are climbing palm\r\ntrees, catching fish, and washing clothes for Christians, Muhammadans,\r\nand depressed classes of Hindus. In South Travancore they make wicker\r\nbaskets, rattan chairs, and sofas. Women, in all parts of the State,\r\nare lime and shell burners. They worship at the Aranmula temple,\r\nand pay special worship to Bhadrakali. Their priest is known as\r\nParakuruppu, who, having to perform four different functions, is\r\nalso entitled Nalonnukaran. It is his duty to preside at marriage\r\nand other rites, to be caste barber, to carry the news of death to\r\nthe relations, and to perform the priestly functions at funerals. The\r\nParavas perform both the tali-kettu and sambandham ceremonies.\"\r\n\r\nParel Maddiyala.--Barbers of the Billavas.\r\n\r\nParenga.--A sub-division of Gadaba.\r\n\r\nPariah.--See Paraiyan.\r\n\r\nParikimuggula.--Professional tattooing women in the Telugu country. The\r\nname refers to the patterns (parika or muggu), which they carry about\r\nwith them, as designs for tattooing or to be drawn on the floor on\r\noccasions of festival and ceremonial.\r\n\r\nParivara.--A sub-division of Bant.\r\n\r\nParivaram.--It is noted, in the Census Report, 1891, that \"this is\r\na caste, which presents some difficulty. Parivaram means 'an army,\r\na retinue,' and it is alleged that the people of this caste were\r\nformerly soldiers. Parivaram is found as a sub-division of Maravan and\r\nAgamudaiyan, and the Parivaras of Madura and Tinnevelly are probably\r\neither a sub-division or an offshoot of the Maravans. In Coimbatore,\r\nthe only other district in which the Parivaras are numerous, they\r\nseem to be a sub-division of Toreyas, a fishing caste, and Mr. Rice,\r\nin his Gazetteer (of Mysore), says that Parivara is a synonym of\r\nBesta.\" Further, in the Census Report, 1901, it is stated that \"the\r\nword Parivaram means 'a retinue,' and was probably originally only an\r\noccupational term. It is now-a-days applied to the domestic servants\r\nand the Tottiya zamindars in the districts of Coimbatore, Trichinopoly,\r\nMadura, and Tinnevelly, who are recruited from several castes, but\r\nhave come to form a caste by themselves. The Kotaris of South Canara\r\nare a somewhat parallel case, and probably in time the Paiks among the\r\nOriyas, and the Khasas, who are servants to the Telugu zamindars, will\r\nsimilarly develop into separate castes. The caste is said to require\r\nall its members of both sexes to do such service for its masters as\r\nthey may require. Persons of any caste above the Paraiyas are admitted\r\ninto its ranks, and the men in it may marry a woman of any other caste\r\nwith the permission of the zamindar under whom they serve. They do not\r\nhabitually employ Brahmans as priests, and in places the head of the\r\nTottiyan caste conducts their ceremonies. Their titles are Maniyagaran\r\nand Servaigaran. The latter is also used by the Agamudaiyans.\"\r\n\r\nThe title Servaigaran or Servaikaran indicates that members of the\r\ncaste do servai, or service, and the further title uliyakkaran is\r\na sign that they do uliyam, or menial work. Servaikaran is also a\r\ntitle of the Tamil Ambalakarans, Agamudaiyans, Kallans, and Maravans,\r\nand the Canarese Toreyas, some of whom have settled in the Tamil\r\ndistricts of Madura and Coimbatore. It also occurs as a synonym of\r\nthe Canarese Kotegaras.\r\n\r\nThe illegitimate offspring of Maravans, Kallans, and Agamudaiyans,\r\nare said to become members of the mixed Parivaram caste.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that the\r\nParivaram caste \"is divided into two endogamous sections; the Chinna\r\nUliyam (little services) who are palanquin-bearers, and have the\r\ntitle Tevan, and the Periya Uliyam (big services), who are called\r\nManiyakaran. The Kombai Parivarams, who are the servants of the\r\nKappiliyan Zamindars of Kombai and Tevaram in the Periyakulam taluk,\r\nare a separate community, and do not intermarry with the others. When\r\na girl attains maturity, she is kept for sixteen days in a hut, which\r\nis guarded at night by her relations. This is afterwards burnt down,\r\nand the pots she used are broken into very small pieces, as there is\r\nan idea that, if rain-water collects in any of them, the girl will\r\nbe childless. Some of the ceremonies at weddings are unusual. On\r\nthe first day, a man takes a big pot of water with a smaller empty\r\npot on top of it, and marches three times round the open space in\r\nfront of the bride's house. With him march the happy couple carrying\r\na bamboo, to which are tied in a turmeric-coloured cloth the nine\r\nkinds of grain. After the third journey round, these things are put\r\ndown at the north-east corner, and the marriage pandal is made by\r\nbringing three more poles of the same size. Afterwards the wrists\r\nof the couple are tied together, and bridegroom's brother carries\r\nthe pair a short distance. They plunge their hands into a bowl of\r\nsalt. Next the husband takes an ordinary stone rolling-pin, wraps it\r\nin a bit of cloth, and gives it to his wife, saying 'Take the child;\r\nI am going to the palace.' She takes it, replying 'Yes, give me the\r\nchild, the milk is ready.' This has to be repeated three times in a set\r\nformula. Several other odd rites are observed. Brahmans officiate, and\r\nthe bridegroom's sister, as usual, ties the tali. Divorce is allowed\r\nto both sides. Adultery within the caste, or with the Zamindar, is\r\ntolerated. The husbands accept as their own any children their wives\r\nmay bear to the Zamindar. Such children are called Chinna Kambalattar,\r\nand may marry with Tottiyans. But adultery outside the caste is most\r\nrigorously prohibited, and sternly punished with excommunication. A\r\nmud image of the girl who so offends is made, two thorns are poked\r\ninto its eyes, and it is thrown away outside the village.\"\r\n\r\nPariyari (doctor).--A name given to Tamil barbers (Ambattan), who\r\npractice as barber-surgeons.\r\n\r\nPariyata.--Five individuals were recorded, at the census, 1901,\r\nunder the name Pariyata or Parit, as members of a Bombay caste of\r\nwashermen in South Canara.\r\n\r\nParvatha.--Parvatha or Parvathala, meaning hill or mountain, has been\r\nrecorded as an exogamous sept of Gamalla, Kapu, Mala, and Medara.\r\n\r\nPasi.--A few members of this Bengal caste of toddy-drawers were\r\nreturned at the Madras census, 1901. The name is said to be derived\r\nfrom pasa, a noose or cord, probably in reference to the sling used by\r\nthem in climbing palm trees. [82] Pasi, meaning coloured glass beads,\r\noccurs as a sub-division of Idaiyan, and the equivalent Pasikatti as\r\na sub-division of Valaiyan.\r\n\r\nPasu.--Pasu (cow) or Pasula has been recorded as an exogamous sept\r\nof Boya, Mala and Madiga, and a sub-division of west coast Pulayans,\r\nwho eat beef.\r\n\r\nPasupula (turmeric).--Pasula or Pasupula is an exogamous sept of\r\nBoya and Devanga. Pasupuleti occurs as a sub-division of Balija. See\r\nArashina.\r\n\r\nPatabonka.--A sub-division of Bonka.\r\n\r\nPatali.--An occupational name applied to priests of temples and\r\nbhuthasthanas (devil shrines), and Stanikas in South Canara.\r\n\r\nPatha (old).--A sub-division of Idiga, and a sept of Togata.\r\n\r\nPathanchitannaya (green pea sept).--An exogamous sept of Bant.\r\n\r\nPathi (cotton).--A sub-division of Kurubas, who use a wrist-thread\r\nmade of cotton and wool mixed during the marriage ceremony. Also an\r\nexogamous sept of Gudala and Padma Sale.\r\n\r\nPathinettan.--The Pathinettan or eighteen are carpenters in Malabar,\r\nwho \"are said to be the descendants of the smiths who remained to\r\nattend to the repairs to the eighteen temples, when the rest of the\r\ncommunity fled to Ceylon, as related in the tradition of the origin\r\nof the Tiyans\". [83]\r\n\r\nPaththar.--A section of Saivite Chettis, who wear the lingam, and\r\nhave separated from the Acharapakam Chettis. They bury their dead in\r\na sitting posture. A bamboo stick is tied to the kudumi (hair-knot)\r\nof the corpse, and the head pulled by its means towards the surface of\r\nthe grave. Paththar is also a name given to goldsmiths by other castes.\r\n\r\nPatnaik.--A title of Karnam.\r\n\r\nPatnulkaran.--The Patnulkarans are described, in the Madras Census\r\nReport, 1901, as \"a caste of foreign weavers found in all the Tamil\r\ndistricts, but mainly in Madura town, who speak Patnuli or Khatri,\r\na dialect of Gujarati, and came originally from Gujarat. They have\r\nalways been known here as Patnulkarans, or silk thread people. They\r\nare referred to in the inscriptions of Kumara Gupta (A.D. 473)\r\nat Mandasor, south of Gujarat, by the name of Pattavayaka, which\r\nis the Sanskrit equivalent of Patnulkaran, and the sasanam of Queen\r\nMangammal of Madura, mentioned below, speaks of them by the same name,\r\nbut lately they have taken to calling themselves Saurashtras from\r\nthe Saurashtra country from which they came. They also claim to be\r\nBrahmans. They thus frequently entered themselves in the schedules\r\nas Saurashtra Brahmans. They are an intelligent and hard-working\r\ncommunity, and deserve every sympathy in the efforts which they\r\nare making to elevate the material prosperity of their members and\r\nimprove their educational condition, but a claim to Brahmanhood is a\r\ndifficult matter to establish. They say that their claim is denied\r\nbecause they are weavers by profession, which none of the Southern\r\nBrahmans are, and because the Brahmans of the Tamil country do not\r\nunderstand their rites, which are the northern rites. The Mandasor\r\ninscriptions, however, represent them as soldiers as well as weavers,\r\nwhich does not sound Brahmanical, and the Tamil Brahmans have never\r\nraised any objections to the Gauda Brahmans calling themselves such,\r\ndifferent as their ways are from those current in the south. In Madura\r\ntheir claim to Brahmanhood has always been disputed. As early as 1705\r\nA.D. the Brahmans of Madura called in question the Patnulkarans' right\r\nto perform the annual upakarma (or renewal of the sacred thread) in\r\nthe Brahman fashion. [Eighteen members of the community were arrested\r\nby the Governor of Madura for performing this ceremony.] The matter\r\nwas taken to the notice of the Queen Mangammal, and she directed her\r\nState pandits to convene meetings of learned men, and to examine into\r\nit. On their advice, she issued a cadjan (palm leaf) sasanam (grant)\r\nwhich permitted them to follow the Brahmanical rites. But all the\r\ntwice-born--whether Brahmans, Kshatriyas, or Vaisyas--are entitled to\r\ndo the same, and the sasanam establishes little. The Patnuls point\r\nout that, in some cases, their gotras are Brahmanical. But, in many\r\ninstances which could be quoted, Kshatriyas had also Brahmanical\r\ngotras.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that the\r\ninscription at Mandasor in Western Malwa \"relates how the Pattavayas,\r\nas the caste was then called, were induced to migrate thither from\r\nLata on the coast of Gujarat by king Kumara Gupta (or one of his\r\nlieutenants), to practice there their art of silk-weaving. The\r\ninscription says many flattering things about the community, and\r\npoetically compares the city to a beautiful woman, and the immigrants\r\nto the silk garments in which she decks herself when she goes to meet\r\nher lover. [The inscription further records that, while the noble\r\nBandhuvarman was governing this city of Dasapura, which had been\r\nbrought to a state of great prosperity, a noble and unequalled temple\r\nof the bright-rayed (sun) was caused to be built by the silk-cloth\r\nweavers (pattavayair) as a guild with the stores of wealth acquired by\r\n(the exercise of their) craft.] On the destruction of Mandasor by the\r\nMussalmans, the Pattavayas seem to have travelled south to Devagiri,\r\nthe modern Daulatabad, the then capital of the Yadavas, and thence,\r\nwhen the Mussalmans again appeared on the scene at the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century, to Vijayanagar, and eventually to Madura. A\r\ncurious ceremony confirming this conjecture is performed to this\r\nday at Patnulkaran weddings in South India. Before the date of the\r\nwedding, the bridegroom's party go to the bride's house, and ask\r\nformally for the girl's hand. Her relations ask them in a set form\r\nof words who they are, and whence they come, and they reply that\r\nthey are from Sorath (the old name for Saurashtra or Kathiawar),\r\nresided in Devagiri, travelled south (owing to Mussalman oppression)\r\nto Vijayanagar, and thence came to Madura. They then ask the bride's\r\nparty the same question, and receive the same reply. A Marathi MS.,\r\nprepared in 1822 at Salem under the direction of the then Collector,\r\nMr. M. D. Cockburn, contains the same tradition. Mr. Sewell's 'A\r\nForgotten Empire: Vijayanagar' shows how common silk clothing and\r\ntrappings were at Vijayanagar in the days of its glory. Most of the\r\nPatnulkarans can still speak Telugu, which raises the inference\r\nthat they must have resided a long time in the Telugu country,\r\nwhile their Patnuli contains many Canarese and Telugu words, and\r\nthey observe the feast of Basavanna (or Boskanna), which is almost\r\npeculiar to the Bellary country. After the downfall of Vijayanagar,\r\nsome of the caste seem to have gone to Bangalore, for a weaving\r\ncommunity called Patvegars, who speak a dialect similar to Patnuli,\r\nstill reside there.\" Concerning the Patnulis who have settled in\r\nthe Mysore Province, it is noted, in the Mysore Census Report, 1891,\r\nthat \"with silk they manufacture a fine stuff called katni, which no\r\nother weavers are said to be able to prepare. It is largely used by\r\nMussalmans for trousers and lungas (gowns). It is said that Haider\r\nAli, while returning from his expeditions against Madras, forcibly\r\nbrought with him some twenty-five families of these weavers, who were\r\nliving in the Tanjore district, and established them at Ganjam near\r\nSeringapatam, and, in order to encourage silk and velvet weaving,\r\nexempted them from certain taxes. The industry flourished till the\r\nfall of Seringapatam, when most of the class fled from the country,\r\na few only having survived those troublous times. At present there are\r\nonly 254 souls returned to these people, employed in making carpets\r\nin Bangalore.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Patnulkars,\" Mr. H. A. Stuart writes, [84] \"say that they were\r\noriginally Brahmans, living in a town of Surat called Devagiri,\r\nin which twelve streets were entirely peopled by them. For some\r\nreason, of which they profess themselves to be ignorant, the\r\nresidents of one of these streets were excommunicated by the rest\r\nof the caste, and expelled. They travelled southwards, and settled\r\nin Tirupati, Arni, and Vellore, as well as in Trichinopoly, Tanjore,\r\nMadura, and other large towns, where they carried on their trade of\r\nsilk-weaving. Another story is to the effect that they were bound to\r\nproduce a certain number of silken cloths at each Dipavali feast in\r\nDevagiri for the goddess Lakshmi. One year their supply fell short,\r\nand they were cursed by the goddess, who decreed that they should no\r\nlonger be regarded as Brahmans. They, however, still claim to be such,\r\nand follow the customs of that caste, though they refuse to eat with\r\nthem. They acknowledge priests from among themselves, as well as from\r\namong Brahmans, and profess to look down upon all other castes. In\r\nreligion they are divided into Smartas, Vaishnavas, and Vyaparis,\r\nsome among the Smartas being Lingayats. Those who can write usually\r\nemploy the Telugu characters in writing their language.\"\r\n\r\nThe Patnulkarans, according to one tradition, claim descent from a\r\ncertain Brahman sage, known as Tantuvardhanar, meaning literally a\r\nperson who improves threads, i.e., manufactures and weaves them into\r\ncloths. This is, it is suggested, probably only an eponymous hero.\r\n\r\nIn the Manual of the Madura district, the Patnulkarans are described\r\nas \"a caste of Surat silk-weavers, whose ancestors were induced to\r\nsettle in Madura by one of the earlier Nayakkan kings, or in response\r\nto an invitation from Tirumala Naik, and who have thriven so well that\r\nthey now form by far the most numerous of all the castes resident in\r\nthe town of Madura. They are very skilful and industrious workmen,\r\nand many of them have become very wealthy. They keep altogether\r\naloof from other castes, and live independently of general society,\r\nspeaking a foreign tongue, and preserving intact the customs of the\r\nland of their origin. They are easily distinguished in appearance\r\nfrom Tamils, being of a light yellowish colour, and having handsomer\r\nand more intelligent features. They are called Chettis or merchants\r\nby Tamils.\" In a recent note, [85] the Patnulkarans of Madura are\r\ndescribed as being \"exceedingly gregarious; they live together in large\r\nnumbers in small houses, and their social status in the country is\r\nquite unsettled. Though they delight to call themselves Saurashtra\r\nBrahmans, the Tamils consider them to be a low caste. Like the\r\nBrahmans, they wear the sacred thread, and tack on to their names such\r\ntitles as Iyengar, Iyer, Rao, Bhagavather, Sastrigal, and so forth,\r\nthough the conservatives among them still cling to the time-honoured\r\nsimple Chetti. Child marriage is the rule, and widow marriage is never\r\npracticed. Hindus by religion, they worship indiscriminately both the\r\nSiva and Vaishnava deities, but all of them wear big Iyengar namams\r\non their foreheads, even more prominently than do the real Iyengars\r\nthemselves. All of them pass for pure vegetarians. The proud position\r\nof Madura to this day as second city in the Presidency is mainly,\r\nif not solely, due to her prosperous and industrious community of\r\nSaurashtra merchants and silk-weavers, who have now grown into nearly\r\nhalf her population, and who have also come to a foremost place among\r\nthe ranks of her citizens. They have their representatives to-day in\r\nthe Municipal Councils and in the Local and District Boards. Their\r\nperseverance has won for them a place in the Devastanam Committee of\r\none of the most prosperous temples in the district. But, in spite of\r\ntheir affluence and leading position it must be confessed that they\r\nare essentially a 'backward class' in respect of English education and\r\nenlightenment. They are, however, making steady progress. An English\r\nhigh school for Saurashtra boys, and a number of elementary schools\r\nfor girls, are now maintained by the Saurashtra Sabha for the proper\r\neducation of their children.\" In 1906, a member of the community was\r\nappointed a member of the committee of the Sri Kalla Alagar temple\r\nin the Madura district.\r\n\r\nIn an order of the Director of Public Instruction, in 1900, it was laid\r\ndown that \"Saurashtras having been recognised (in 1892) as a backward\r\nclass falling under Pattunulgars, the manager cannot continue to enjoy\r\nthe privileges accorded under the grant-in-aid code to schools intended\r\nfor backward classes, if he returns his pupils as Brahmans. If the\r\npupils have been returned as Saurashtra Brahmans, the manager should\r\nbe requested to revise, as no such caste is recognised.\" A deputation\r\nhad an interview with the Director, and it was subsequently ruled that\r\n\"Saurashtras will continue to be treated as a backward class. Pupils\r\nbelonging to the above class should invariably be returned in future\r\nas Saurashtras, whether the word Brahman is added or not.\"\r\n\r\nIn a \"History of the Saurashtras in Southern India\" [86] it is recorded\r\nthat \"when the Saurashtras settled in the south, they reproduced the\r\ninstitutions of their mother country in the new land; but, owing to the\r\ninfluence of the Southern Dravidians, some of the institutions became\r\nextinct. During their migrations, the men were under the guidance of\r\ntheir leader, and the process of migration tended to increase the power\r\nof kinship. The people were divided into four heads, called Goundas\r\n(chiefs), Saulins (elders), Voyddoos (physicians), and Bhoutuls\r\n(religious men). Some traces of the division still survive in the\r\nnow neglected institution of Goundans. The Goundans were supposed\r\nto be responsible for the acts and doings of their men. The masses\r\nenjoyed the property under the joint undivided Hindu family system\r\nas prescribed in the Code of Manu. The chiefs were the judges in\r\nboth civil and criminal affairs. They were aided in deciding cases\r\nby a body of nobles called Saulins. The office of the Saulins is\r\nto make enquiries, and try all cases connected with the community,\r\nand to abide by the decision of the chiefs. The Voyddoos (pandits)\r\nand Bhoutuls (Josis and Kavis also ranked with Voyddas and Bhoutuls)\r\nhad their honours on all important occasions, and they are placed in\r\nthe same rank with the elders. The Karestuns, or the Commons, are\r\nthe whole body of the masses. Their voice is necessary on certain\r\nimportant occasions, as during the ceremonies of excommunication,\r\nand prayaschittas for admitting renegades, and during periodical\r\nmeetings of the community. The Goundans at present are not exercising\r\nany of their powers, except in some religious matters. Saurashtra\r\nBrahmans were originally leading a purely religious life, but now\r\nthey have begun to do business of different descriptions fitted to\r\ntheir position. Their chief occupation is agriculture, but some are\r\ntrading, dyeing and weaving; however, it can be safely affirmed that\r\ntheir business interferes in no way with their religious creed and\r\nceremonies. The name Patnulgar means silk weavers, and is sometimes\r\nerroneously applied to the Saurashtras too; but, on the contrary,\r\nthe term strictly applies to all classes of weavers in Southern\r\nIndia, called Seniyars, Kaikkolars, Devangas, Kshatris (Khattris),\r\nParayas, Sengundas, Mudaliars, Saliyurs, Padmasalays, but not to the\r\nSaurashtras in any way. The Saurashtras are now seen as a mercantile\r\ncommunity. They are brave but humble, god-fearing, hospitable, fond\r\nof festivities and amusement. The Saurashtras, it is said, were\r\noriginally a class of sun worshippers, from soura meaning sun, but\r\nthe term Saurashtra means inhabitants of the fruitful kingdom. Their\r\nreligion is Hinduism, and they were originally Madhvas. After their\r\nsettlement in Southern India, some of them, owing to the preachings\r\nof Sankaracharya and Ramanujacharya, were converted into Saivites and\r\nVaishnavites respectively. The Saurashtras belong to the Aksobhya and\r\nSankaracharya Matas. The Saurashtras, like other nations of India,\r\nare divided into four great divisions, viz., Brahma, Kshatriya, Vaisya\r\nand Sudra. The Vaisyas and Sudras are to be found in almost all towns\r\nand villages, and especially at Tirupati, Nagari, Naranavanam, Arni,\r\nKottar, Palani, Palamcottah, Vilangudi, and Viravanallur.\"\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the Patnulkarans at Madura are managed by a Saurashtra\r\nSabha, which was started in 1895. Among the laudable objects for\r\nwhich the Sabha was established, the following may be noted:--\r\n\r\n(a) To manage the Madura Saurashtra school, and establish\r\nreading-rooms, libraries, etc., with a view to enable members of the\r\nSaurashtra community to receive, on moderate terms, a sound, liberal,\r\ngeneral and technical education.\r\n\r\n(b) To manage the temple known as the Madura Sri Prasanna Venkateswara\r\nSwami's temple, and contribute towards its maintenance by constructing,\r\nrepairing and preserving buildings in connection therewith, making\r\njewels, vehicles and other things necessary therefor, and conducting\r\nthe festivals thereof.\r\n\r\n(c) To found charitable institutions, such as orphanages, hospitals,\r\npoor-houses, choultries (resting-places for travellers), water-sheds,\r\nand other things of a like nature for the good of the Saurashtra\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n(d) To give succour to the suffering poor, and the maimed, the lame,\r\nand the blind in the Saurashtra community.\r\n\r\n(e) To give pecuniary grants in aid of upanayanams (thread marriages)\r\nto the helpless in the Saurashtra community.\r\n\r\n(f) To erect such works of utility as bathing ghauts, wells, water\r\nfountains, and other works of utility for the benefit of the Saurashtra\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n(g) To fix and raise subscriptions known as mahamais (a sort of\r\nincome-tax).\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects of the lectures delivered in connection with the\r\nSaurashtra Upanyasa Sabha at Madura in 1901 were the life of Mrs. Annie\r\nBesant, the Paris Exhibition of 1900, Mr. Tata and higher education,\r\nSaurashtra bank, Columbus, and the Saurashtra reform hotel.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, the Saurashtra community submitted a memorial to\r\nthe Governor of Madras to the effect that \"as the backward Saurashtra\r\ncommunity have not the requisite capital of half a lakh of rupees for\r\nimparting to their members both general and technical education, the\r\nSaurashtra Sabha, Madura, suggests that a lottery office may be kept\r\nfor collecting shares at one rupee each from such of the public at\r\nlarge as may be willing to give the same, on the understanding that,\r\nevery time the collections aggregate to Rs. 6,250, Rs. 250 should be\r\nset apart for the expenses of working the said office, and two-thirds\r\nof the remainder for educational purposes, and one-third should be\r\nawarded by drawing lots among the subscribers in the shape of five\r\nprizes, ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 125.\" In passing orders on this\r\nsporting scheme, the Government stated that it was not prepared to\r\nauthorise the lottery. It has been well said [87] that the Patnulkarans\r\nhave a very strong esprit de corps, and this has stood them in good\r\nstead in their weaving, which is more scientifically carried on,\r\nand in a more flourishing condition than is usual elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor the following note on the Patnulkaran weavers of Madura, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. A. Chatterton, Director of Technical Enquiries:--\"As\r\na general rule, they are in a flourishing condition, and much better\r\noff than the Saurashtra weavers in Salem. This is probably due to\r\nthe fact that the bulk of the Madura trade is in a higher class of\r\ncloth than at Salem, and the weavers are consequently less affected by\r\nfluctuations in demand for their goods due to seasonal variations. In\r\nvarious ways the Saurashtras of Madura have furnished evidence that\r\nthey are a progressive community, particularly in the attention\r\nwhich they pay to education, and the keenness with which they are on\r\nthe look-out for improvements in the methods of carrying out their\r\nhereditary craft. Nearly all the so-called improvements have been\r\ntried at Madura, and the fact that they have rejected most of them may\r\nbe taken to some extent as evidence of their unsuitability for Indian\r\nconditions. Some time ago, one A. A. Kuppusawmy Iyer invented certain\r\nimprovements in the native shedding apparatus, whereby ornamental\r\npatterns are woven along the borders, and on the ends of the better\r\nclass of silk and cotton cloths. This apparatus was undoubtedly a\r\nmaterial improvement upon that which is ordinarily used by the weaver,\r\nand it has been taken up extensively in the town. It is said that\r\nthere are 350 looms fitted with this shedding apparatus, and the\r\ninventor, who has obtained a patent for it, is trying to collect a\r\nroyalty of Rs. 1-4-0 a month on each loom. But this claim is resisted\r\nby a combination of the weavers using this shedding apparatus, and a\r\nsuit is at the present time (1907) pending in the District Court. One\r\nof the most important weaving enterprises at Madura is the Meenakshi\r\nWeaving Company, the partners of which are Ramachandra Iyer, Muthurama\r\nIyer, and Kuppusawmy Iyer. Their subscribed capital is Rs. 1,00,000,\r\nof which they are spending no less than Rs. 40,000 on building a\r\nweaving shed and office. The Madura dyeing industry is in the hands\r\nof the Saurashtras, and the modern phase dates back only as far as\r\n1895, when Mr. Tulsiram started dyeing grey yarn with alizarine red,\r\nand, in the twelve years which have since elapsed, the industry has\r\ngrown to very large proportions. The total sales at Madura average\r\nat present about 24 lakhs a year. There are from 30 to 40 dye-houses,\r\nand upwards of 5,000 cwt. of alizarine red is purchased every year from\r\nthe Badische Aniline Soda Fabrik. The yarn is purchased locally, mainly\r\nfrom the Madura Mills, but, to some extent, also from Coimbatore and\r\nTuticorin. The mordanting is done entirely with crude native earths,\r\ncontaining a large percentage of potassium salts. Drying the yarn\r\npresents considerable difficulty, especially in the wet weather. To\r\nsecure a fast even colour, the yarn is mordanted about ten times,\r\nand dyed twice, or for very superior work three times, and between\r\neach operation it is essential that the yarn should be dried. The\r\nsuburbs of Madura are now almost entirely covered with drying yards.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Patnulkarans who have settled in Travancore,\r\nMr. N. Subramani Aiyar writes as follows. \"The Patnulkarans are\r\ngenerally of yellowish tinge, and in possession of handsomer and more\r\nintellectual features than the Tamil castes, from which they may be\r\neasily differentiated by even a casual observer. They are, however,\r\nmore fair than cleanly. They keep in Travancore, as elsewhere,\r\naloof from other castes, and live independently of general society,\r\nspeaking a foreign language. This they have preserved with astonishing\r\nattachment, and recently a Saurashtra alphabet has been invented, and\r\nelementary books have begun to be written in that dialect. They are a\r\nvery conservative class, religious enthusiasts of a very remarkable\r\norder, and skilful and industrious workmen. They take a peculiar\r\npleasure in music, and many of them are excellent songsters. There\r\nare many kinds of amusement for both men and women, who generally\r\nspend their leisure in singing songs of a devotional nature. They\r\nbelieve largely in omens, of which the following may be noted:--\r\n\r\nGood.--A pot full of water, a burning light, no Brahmans, a Sudra,\r\na cow, a married woman, and gold.\r\n\r\nBad.--A barber, a patient, a person with some bodily defect, fuel,\r\noil, a donkey, a pick-axe, a broom, and a fan.\r\n\r\n\"On entering a Patnulkaran's house, we are led to a courtyard,\r\nspacious and neat, where all the necessary arrangements are made for\r\nweaving purposes. The Patnulkarans live in streets. A male Patnulkaran\r\nresembles a Tamil Vaishnava Brahman in outward appearance, but the\r\nwomen follow the custom of the Telugu Brahmans alike in their costume\r\nand ornaments. Their jewels exactly resemble those of the Telugu\r\nBrahman women, and indicate a temporary residence of the caste in the\r\nTelugu country on the way from Gujarat to Madura. There is a Tamil\r\nproverb to the effect that, if a male Patnulkaran is seen without his\r\nwife, he will be taken for a Vaishnava Brahman, whereas, in the case\r\nof the Tatan caste, a woman without her husband will be taken for an\r\nAiyangar. Children wear the karai round the neck. Tattooing prevails\r\non a very large scale.\r\n\r\n\"The Patnulkarans may be divided into three classes on a religious\r\nbasis, viz., (1) pure Vaishnavites, who wear the vertical Vaishnavite\r\nmark, and call themselves Vadakalas or northerners; (2) those who are\r\nmainly Smartas; (3) Sankara Vaishnavas, who wear gopi (sandal paste)\r\nas their sect-mark. It is to the last of these religious sects that the\r\nTravancore Patnulkarans belong, though, in recent times, a few Smartas\r\nhave settled at Kottar. All these intermarry and interdine, and the\r\nreligious difference does not create a distinction in the caste. The\r\nchief divinity of the Patnulkarans is Venkatachalapati of Tirupati. The\r\nmonth in which he is most worshipped is Kanni (September-October), and\r\nall the Saturdays and the Tiruvonam star of the month are particularly\r\ndevoted to his adoration. One of their men becomes possessed on any of\r\nthese days, and, holding a burning torch-light in his hand, touches\r\nthe foreheads of the assembled devotees therewith. The Patnulkarans\r\nfast on those days, and take an image of Garuda in procession through\r\nthe street. The Dipavali, Pannamasi in Chittiray, and the Vaikuntha\r\nEkadasi are other important religious days. The Dusserah is observed,\r\nas also are the festivals of Sri Rama Navami, Ashtami, Rohini,\r\nAvani Avittam, and Vara Lakshmivratam. Formal worship of deities\r\nis done by those who have obtained the requisite initiation from a\r\nspiritual preceptor. Women who have husbands fast on full-moon days,\r\nMondays, and Fridays. The serpent and the banyan tree are specially\r\nworshipped. Women sing songs in praise of Lakshmi, and offer fruits\r\nand cocoanuts to her. The Patnulkarans have a temple dedicated to\r\nSri Rama at Kottar. This temple is visited even by Brahmans, and the\r\npriests are Aiyangars. The Acharya, or supreme religious authority of\r\nthe Patnulkarans, in Travancore is a Vaishnava Brahman known as Ubhaya\r\nVedanta Koti Kanyakadana Tatachariyar, who lives at Aravankulam near\r\nTinnevelly, and possesses a large number of disciples. Once a year\r\nhe visits his flock in Travancore, and is highly respected by them,\r\nas also by the Maharaja, who makes a donation of money to him. Elders\r\nare appointed to decide social disputes, and manage the common property\r\nof the caste. In Travancore there are said to be only three families\r\nof Patnulkaran priests. For the higher ceremonies, Brahman priests\r\nare employed.\r\n\r\n\"A girl's marriage is usually celebrated before puberty, and\r\nsometimes when she is a mere child of four or five. Great importance\r\nis attached to gotras or exogamous septs, and it is said that the\r\nsepts of the bride and bridegroom are conspicuously inscribed on the\r\nwalls of a marriage house. In the selection of an auspicious hour\r\n(muhurtam) for a marriage, two favourable planetary situations, one\r\nclosely following the other, are necessary; and, as such occasions\r\nare rare, a number of marriages take place at one time. A man may\r\nclaim his maternal uncle's daughter as his wife, and polygamy is\r\npermitted. The marriage ceremonial resembles the Brahmanical rites\r\nin many points. On the fourth day, a ceremonial observed by Telugu\r\nBrahmans, called Nagabali, is performed. The marriage badge, which\r\nis tied on the bride's neck, is called bottu. [From a note on the\r\nmarriage ceremonies among the Patnulkarans of Madura, I gather that,\r\nas among Telugu and Canarese castes, a number of pots are arranged,\r\nand worshipped. These pots are smaller and fewer in number than at\r\na Telugu or Canarese wedding. A figure of a car is drawn on the wall\r\nof the house with red earth or laterite. [88] On it the name of the\r\ngotra of the bridegroom is written. On the fourth day, the nagavali\r\n(or offering to Devas) is performed. The contracting couple sit near\r\nthe pots, and a number of lights are arranged on the floor. The pots,\r\nwhich represent the Devas, are worshipped.]\r\n\r\n\"The namakarana, or name-giving ceremony, is performed on the eleventh\r\nday after birth. An eighth child, whether male or female, is called\r\nKrishna, owing to the tradition that Krishna was born as the eighth\r\nchild of Vasudeva. Babies are affectionately called Duddu (milk)\r\nor Pilla (child). The annaprasana, or first feeding of the child,\r\nis sometimes celebrated at the end of the first year, but usually as\r\na preliminary to some subsequent ceremony. Sometimes, in performance\r\nof a vow, boys are taken to the shrine at Tirupati for the tonsure\r\nceremony. The upanayana is performed between the seventh and twelfth\r\nyears, but neither brahmacharya nor samavartana is observed.\r\n\r\n\"The dead are burnt, and the remains of the bones are collected and\r\ndeposited under water. Death pollution lasts only for ten days. The\r\nsradh, or annual ceremony, when oblations are offered to ancestors,\r\nis observed. Widows are allowed to retain their hair, but remove the\r\nbottu. Unlike Brahman women, they chew betel, and wear coloured cloths,\r\neven in old age.\"\r\n\r\nThe Patnulkarans have a secret trade language, concerning which\r\nMr. C. Hayavadana Rao writes as follows. \"The most remarkable\r\nfeature about it is the number of terms and phrases borrowed from\r\nthe craft, to which special meanings are given. Thus a man of no\r\nstatus is stigmatised as a rikhta khandu, i.e., a spindle without\r\nthe yarn. Similarly, a man of little sense is called a mhudha, the\r\nname of a thick peg which holds one side of the roller. Likewise,\r\na talkative person is referred to as a rhetta, or roller used for\r\nwinding the thread upon spindles, which makes a most unpleasant\r\ncreaking noise. Kapiniker, from kapini, a technical term used for\r\ncutting the loom off, means to make short work of an undesirable\r\nperson. A man who is past middle age is called porkut phillias, which,\r\nin weavers' parlance, means that half the loom is turned.\"\r\n\r\nPatra.--The Patras are an Oriya caste, which is divided into\r\ntwo sections, one of which is engaged in the manufacture of silk\r\n(pata) waist-threads, tassels, etc., and the other in weaving silk\r\ncloths. The members of the two sections do not interdine. The former\r\nhave exogamous septs or bamsams, the names of which are also used as\r\ntitles, e.g., Sahu, Patro, and Prushti. The latter have exogamous\r\nsepts, such as Tenga, Jaggali, Telaga, and Mahanayako, and Behara\r\nand Nayako as titles. The chief headman of the cloth-weaving section\r\nis called Mahanayako, and there are other officers called Behara and\r\nBhollobaya. The headman of the other section is called Senapati, and\r\nhe is assisted by a Dhanapati. Infant marriage is the rule, and, if a\r\ngirl does not secure a husband before she reaches maturity, she must,\r\nif she belongs to the cloth-weaving section, go through a form of\r\nmarriage with an old man, and, if to the other section, with an arrow.\r\n\r\nThe Telugu Patras are summed up, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,\r\nas \"a Telugu caste of hunters and cultivators, found chiefly in the\r\ndistricts of Cuddapah and Kurnool. It has two divisions, the Doras\r\n(chiefs), and Gurikalas (marksmen), the former of which is supposed\r\nto be descended from the old Poligars (feudal chiefs), and the latter\r\nfrom their followers and servants. This theory is supported by the\r\nfact that, at the weddings of Gurikalas, the Doras receive the first\r\npan-supari (betel leaf and areca nut). Widows may not remarry, nor\r\nis divorce recognised. They usually employ Brahmans at marriages, and\r\nSatanis at funerals. Though they are Vaishnavites, they also worship\r\nvillage deities, such as Gangamma and Ellamma. They bury their dead,\r\nand perform annual sraddhas (memorial services for the dead). They\r\nwill eat with Gollas. Their title is Naidu.\"\r\n\r\nPatramela.--Patramela, or Patradeva, is the name of a class of\r\ndancing girls in South Canara. Patramela, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,\r\n[89] is the name by which the Konkani Kalavants (courtezans) are\r\nknown above the ghauts.\r\n\r\nPatro.--The title of the head of a group of villages in Ganjam, and\r\nalso recorded, at times of census, as a title of Alia, Kalinga Komati,\r\nDolai, and Jaggala. The conferring of a cloth (sadhi) on a Patro\r\nis said to be emblematic of conferring an estate. The Patro, among\r\nother perquisites, is entitled to a fee on occasions of marriage. I\r\nam informed that, in the Ganjam Maliahs, if a Kondh was unable to\r\npay the fee, he met his love at night beneath two trysting trees,\r\nand retired with her into the jungle for three days and nights.\r\n\r\nPatrudu.--The title, meaning those who are fit to receive a gift,\r\nof Aiyarakulu and Nagaralu.\r\n\r\nPattadhikari.--A class of Jangams, who have settled head-quarters.\r\n\r\nPattan.--The equivalent of the Brahman Bhatta. A name by which some\r\nKammalans, especially goldsmiths, style themselves.\r\n\r\nPattanavada.--A synonym for the Moger fishing caste, the settlements\r\nof which are called pattana.\r\n\r\nPattanavan.--The fishermen on the east coast, from the Kistna to\r\nthe Tanjore district, are popularly called Karaiyan, or sea-shore\r\npeople. Some Karaiyans have, at times of census, returned themselves\r\nas Taccha (carpenter) Karaiyans.\r\n\r\nPattanavan means literally a dweller in a town or pattanam, which\r\nword occurs in the names of various towns on the sea-coast, e.g.,\r\nNagapattanam (Negapatam), Chennapattanam (Madras). The Pattanavans\r\nhave two main divisions, Periya (big) and Chinna (small), and, in some\r\nplaces, for example, at Nadukuppam in the Nellore district, exogamous\r\nsepts, e.g., Gengananga, Peyananga, Kathananga (children of Ganga,\r\nPeyan, and Kathanar), and Kullananga (children of dwarfs). In the\r\nTelugu country, they go by the name of Pattapu or Tulivandlu.\r\n\r\nSome Pattanavans give themselves high-sounding caste titles, e.g.,\r\nAriyar, Ayyayiraththalaivar (the five thousand chiefs), Ariya Nattu\r\nChetti (Chettis of the Ariyar country), Acchu Vellala, Karaiturai\r\n(sea-coast) Vellala, Varunakula Vellala or Varunakula Mudali after\r\nVaruna, the god of the waters, or Kurukula vamsam after Kuru, the\r\nancestor of the Kauravas. Some Pattanavans have adopted the title\r\nPillai.\r\n\r\nThe Pattanavans are said to be inferior to the Sembadavans, who will\r\nnot accept food at their hands, and discard even an earthen pot which\r\nhas been touched by a Pattanavan.\r\n\r\nConcerning the origin of the caste, there is a legend that the\r\nPattanavans were giving silk thread to Siva, and were hence called\r\nPattanavar, a corruption of Pattanaivor, meaning knitters of silk\r\nthread. They were at the time all bachelors, and Siva suggested the\r\nfollowing method of securing wives for them. They were told to go out\r\nfishing in the sea, and make of their catch as many heaps as there\r\nwere bachelors. Each of them then stood before a heap, and called for\r\na wife, who was created therefrom. According to another story, some\r\nfive thousand years ago, during the age of the lunar race, there was\r\none Dasa Raja, who was ruling near Hastinapura, and was childless. To\r\nsecure offspring, he prayed to god, and did severe penance. In answer\r\nto his prayer, God pointed out a tank full of lotus flowers, and told\r\nthe king to go thither, and call for children. Thereon, five thousand\r\nchildren issued forth from the flowers, to the eldest of whom the king\r\nbequeathed his kingdom, and to the others money in abundance. Those who\r\nreceived the money travelled southward in ships, which were wrecked,\r\nand they were cast ashore. This compelled them to make friends of local\r\nsea fishermen, whose profession they adopted. At the present day, the\r\nmajority of Pattanavans are sea-fishermen, and catch fish with nets\r\nfrom catamarans. \"Fancy,\" it has been written, [90] \"a raft of only\r\nthree logs of wood, tied together at each end when they go out to sea,\r\nand untied and left to dry on the beach when they come in again. Each\r\ncatamaran has one, two or three men to manage it; they sit crouched on\r\nit upon their heels, throwing their paddles about very dexterously,\r\nbut remarkably unlike rowing. In one of the early Indian voyager's\r\nlog-books there is an entry concerning a catamaran: 'This morning,\r\n6 A.M., saw distinctly two black devils playing at single stick. We\r\nwatched these infernal imps about an hour, when they were lost in\r\nthe distance. Surely this doth portend some great tempest.' It is\r\nvery curious to watch these catamarans putting out to sea. They get\r\nthrough the fiercest surf, sometimes dancing at their ease on the\r\ntop of the waters, sometimes hidden under the waters; sometimes the\r\nman completely washed off his catamaran, and man floating one way\r\nand catamaran another, till they seem to catch each other again by\r\nmagic.\" In 1906, a fisherman was going out in his catamaran to fish\r\noutside the Madras harbour, and was washed off his craft, and dashed\r\nviolently against a rock. Death was instantaneous. Of the catamaran,\r\nthe following account is given by Colonel W. Campbell. [91] \"Of all\r\nthe extraordinary craft which the ingenuity of man has ever invented,\r\na Madras catamaran is the most extraordinary, the most simple, and yet,\r\nin proper hands, the most efficient. It is merely three rough logs of\r\nwood, firmly lashed together with ropes formed from the inner bark of\r\nthe cocoanut tree. Upon this one, two, or three men, according to the\r\nsize of the catamaran, sit on their heels in a kneeling posture, and,\r\ndefying wind and weather, make their way through the raging surf which\r\nbeats upon the coast, and paddle out to sea at times when no other\r\ncraft can venture to face it. At a little distance, the slight fabric\r\non which these adventurous mariners float becomes invisible, and a\r\nfleet of them approaching the land presents the absurd appearance\r\nof a host of savage-looking natives wading out towards the ship,\r\nup to their middle in water.\" \"A catamaran,\" Lady Dufferin writes,\r\n[92] in an account of a state arrival at Madras, \"is two logs of wood\r\nlashed together, forming a very small and narrow raft. The rower wears\r\na 'fool's cap,' in which he carries letters (also betel and tobacco),\r\nand, when he encounters a big wave, he leaves his boat, slips through\r\nthe wave himself, and picks up his catamaran on the other side of\r\nit. Some very large deep barges (masula boats), the planks of which\r\nare sewn together to give elasticity, and the interstices stuffed\r\nwith straw, came out for us, with a guard of honour of the mosquito\r\nfleet, as the catamarans are called, on either side of them; two of\r\nthe fool's cap men, and a flag as big as the boat itself, on each\r\none.\" The present day masula or mussoola boat, or surf boat of the\r\nCoromandel Coast, is of the same build as several centuries ago. It\r\nis recorded, [93] in 1673, that \"I went ashore in a Mussoola, a boat\r\nwherein ten men paddle, the two aftermost of whom are the Steers-men,\r\nusing their Paddles instead of a Rudder: The Boat is not strengthened\r\nwith knee-timber, as ours are; the bended Planks are sowed together\r\nwith Rope-yarn of the Cocoe, and calked with Dammar so artificially\r\nthat it yields to every ambitious surf. Otherwise we could not get\r\nashore, the Bar knocking in pieces all that are inflexible.\" The\r\nold records of Madras contain repeated references to Europeans being\r\ndrowned from overturning of masula boats in the surf, through which\r\na landing had to be effected before the harbour was built.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, two Madras fishermen were invested with silver wrist bangles,\r\nbearing a suitable inscription, which were awarded by the Government\r\nin recognition of their bravery in saving the lives of a number of\r\nboatmen during a squall in the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe following are the fishes, which are caught by the fishermen off\r\nMadras and eaten by Europeans:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cybium guttatum, Bl. Schn. Seir.\r\n    Cybium Commersonii, Lacep. Seir.\r\n    Cybium lanceolatum, Cuv. & Val. Seir.\r\n    Sillago sihama, Forsk. Whiting.\r\n    Stromateus cinereus, Bloch.--\r\n            Immature, silver pomfret.\r\n            Adult, grey pomfret.\r\n    Stromateus niger, Bloch. Black pomfret.\r\n    Mugal subviridis, Cuv. & Val. Mullet.\r\n    Psettodes erumei, Bl. Schn. 'Sole.'\r\n    Lates calcarifer, Bloch. Cock-up; the begti of Calcutta.\r\n    Lutjanus roseus, Day.\r\n    Lutjanus marginatus, Cuv. & Val.\r\n    Polynemus tetradactylus, Shaw.\r\n    Chorinemus lysan, Forsk.\r\n    'Whitebait.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pattanavans are Saivites, but also worship various minor gods\r\nand Grama Devatas (village deities). In some places, they regard\r\nKuttiyandavan as their special sea god. To him animal sacrifices\r\nare not made, but goats are sacrificed to Sembu Virappan or Minnodum\r\nPillai, an attendant on Kuttiyandavan. In Tanjore, the names of the\r\nsea gods are Pavadairayan and Padaithalaidaivam. Before setting out\r\non a fishing expedition, the Pattanavans salute the god, the sea,\r\nand the nets. In the Tanjore district, they repair their nets once in\r\neight days, and, before they go out fishing, pray to their gods to\r\nfavour them with a big catch. On a fixed day, they make offerings\r\nto the gods on their return from fishing. The gods Pavadairayan\r\nand Padaithalaidaivam are represented by large conical heaps of wet\r\nsand and mud, and Ayyanar, Ellamma, Kuttiyandavar, Muthyalrouthar\r\nand Kiliyendhi by smaller heaps. At the Masimakam festival, the\r\nPattanavans worship their gods on the sea-shore. The names Jattan and\r\nJatti are given to children during the Jatre or periodic festival of\r\nthe village goddesses.\r\n\r\nThe Pattanavans afford a good example of a caste, in which the\r\ntime-honoured village council (panchayat) is no empty, powerless\r\nbody. For every settlement or village there are one or more headmen\r\ncalled Yejamanan, who are assisted by a Thandakaran and a Paraiyan\r\nChalavathi. All these offices are hereditary. Questions connected\r\nwith the community, such as disrespect to elders, breach of social\r\netiquette, insult, abuse, assault, adultery, or drinking or eating\r\nwith men of lower caste, are enquired into by the council. Even\r\nwhen disputes are settled in courts of law, they must come before\r\nthe council. Within the community, the headman is all powerful, and\r\nhis decision is, in most instances, considered final. If, however,\r\nhis verdict is not regarded as equitable, the case is referred to a\r\ncaste headman, who holds sway over a group of villages. No ceremony\r\nmay be performed without the sanction of the local headman, and the\r\ndetails of ceremonies, except the feasting, are arranged by the\r\nheadman and the Thandakaran. In the case of a proposed marriage,\r\nthe match is broken off if the headman objects to it. He should be\r\npresent at the funeral rites, and see that the details thereof are\r\nproperly carried out. It is the duty of the Chalavathi to convey the\r\nnews of a death to the relations. Should he come to the shore when\r\nthe fishes are heaped up, he has the right to take a few thereof as\r\nhis perquisite. The Thandakaran, among other duties, has to summon\r\ncouncil meetings. When the members of council have assembled, he ushers\r\nin the parties who have to appear before it, and salutes the assembly\r\nby prostrating himself on the floor. The parties take a bit of straw,\r\nor other object, and place it before the headman in token that they\r\nare willing to abide by the decision of the council. This formality\r\nis called placing the agreement (muchchilika).\r\n\r\nThe consent of the maternal uncles is necessary before a pair can\r\nbe united in matrimony. When the wedding day has been fixed, the\r\nbridegroom's party distribute grama thambulam (village pan-supari or\r\nbetel) to the headman and villagers. The marriage milk-post is made of\r\nMimusops hexandra, Erythrina indica, Casuarina equisetifolia, the green\r\nwood of some other tree, or even a pestle. In one form of the marriage\r\nceremony, which varies in detail according to locality, the bridegroom,\r\non the arrival of the bride at the pandal (booth), puts on the sacred\r\nthread, and the Brahman purohit makes the sacred fire, and pours ghi\r\n(clarified butter) into it. The bridegroom ties the tali round the\r\nbride's neck, and the maternal uncles tie flat silver or gold plates,\r\ncalled pattam, on the foreheads of the contracting couple. Rings are\r\nput on their second toes by the brother-in-law of the bridegroom\r\nand the maternal uncle of the bride. Towards evening, the sacred\r\nthread, the threads which have been tied to the marriage pots and the\r\nmilk-post, and grain seedlings used at the ceremony, are thrown into\r\nthe sea. Some Pattanavans allow a couple to live together as man and\r\nwife after the betrothal, but before the marriage ceremony. This is,\r\nhowever, on condition that the latter is performed as soon as it is\r\nconvenient. The remarriage of widows is freely permitted. No marriage\r\npandal is erected, and the bridegroom, or a female relation, ties the\r\ntali on the bride's neck within the house. Such marriage is, therefore,\r\ncalled naduvittu (interior of the house) tali. When a woman, who has\r\nbeen guilty of adultery, is remarried, a turmeric string is substituted\r\nfor the golden tali, and is tied on the bride's neck by a woman.\r\n\r\nSome Pattanavans have adopted the custom of burying their dead in a\r\nseated posture (samathi). If a corpse is cremated, fire is carried to\r\nthe burning-ground by a barber. When the corpse has been laid on the\r\npyre, rice is thrown over it. The son, accompanied by a barber and a\r\nPanisavan or washerman, and carrying a pot of water on his shoulder,\r\ngoes thrice round the pyre. At the third round, the Panisavan or\r\nwasherman makes holes in the pot, and it is thrown away. On the day of\r\nthe funeral, all the agnates shave their heads. On the following day,\r\nthey go to the burial or burning ground with tender cocoanuts, milk,\r\ncakes, etc., and Arichandra, who presides over the burial-ground,\r\nis worshipped. Milk is then poured over the grave, or the remains\r\nof the bones, which are thrown into the sea. On the night of the\r\nfifteenth day, Panisavans blow the conch and horn, and red cloths\r\nare presented to the widow of the deceased by her relations. At about\r\n4 A.M., a white cloth is thrown on her neck, and the tali string is\r\ncut by an old woman. The tali is removed therefrom, and dropped into\r\na new pot filled with water. Hence, a form of abuse among Pattanavan\r\nwomen is, May your tali be snapped, and thrown into water. The tali\r\nis removed from the pot, which is thrown into the sea. The tali is\r\nlaid on a dish containing milk, and all those who visit the widow\r\nmust set eyes on it before they see her.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Madras, the Pattanavans have the privilege of supplying\r\nbearers at temples, and the atmosphere surrounding them as they carry\r\nthe idols on their sturdy shoulders through Triplicane is said to be\r\n\"redolent of brine and the toddy shop.\"\r\n\r\nIn a judgment of the High Court of Judicature, Madras, it is recorded\r\nthat, in the eighteenth century, some boat-owners and boatmen\r\nbelonging to the Curukula Vamsha or Varunakula Mudali caste, who were\r\nresiding at Chepauk in the city of Madras, had embraced Christianity,\r\nand worshipped in a chapel, which had been erected by voluntary\r\ncontributions. In 1799 the site of their village was required for\r\npublic purposes, and they obtained in lieu of it a grant of land\r\nat Royapuram, where a chapel was built. Partly by taxes levied on\r\nboatmen, and partly by tolls they were allowed to impose on persons\r\nfor frequenting the Royapuram bazar, a fund was formed to provide for\r\ntheir spiritual wants, and this fund was administered by the Marine\r\nBoard. In 1829, a portion of the fund was expended in the erection\r\nof the church of St. Peter, Royapuram, and the fund was transferred\r\nto Government. The administration of the fund has been the source of\r\nlitigation in the High Court. [94]\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mrs. F. E. Penny that some of the fisherfolk \"adopted\r\nXavier as their special patron saint, and, as time passed, almost\r\ndeified him. In the present day, they appeal to him in times of\r\ndanger, crying 'Xavier! Xavier! Xavier!' in storm and peril. Even if\r\nthey are unfortunate in their catch when fishing, they turn to their\r\nsaint for succour.\"\r\n\r\nAs a numismatist, I resent the practice resorted to by some fishermen\r\nof melting old lead coins, and converting them into sinkers for\r\ntheir nets.\r\n\r\nPattapu.--Pattapu for Tulivandlu is a name for Tamil Pattanavans,\r\nwho have migrated to the Telugu country. Pattapu also occurs as a\r\nsub-division of Yerukala.\r\n\r\nPattar.--The Pattars are Tamil Brahmans, who have settled in\r\nMalabar. The name is said to be derived from the Sanskrit bhatta. It\r\nis noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that Pattar (teacher)\r\nhas been recently assumed as a title by some Nokkans in Tanjore. (See\r\nBrahman.)\r\n\r\nPattariar.--Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as a Tamil\r\ncorruption of Pattu Saliyan (silk-weaver). Pattariar or Pattalia is\r\na synonym of Tamil-speaking Saliyans.\r\n\r\nPattegara (headman).--An exogamous sept of Okkiliyan.\r\n\r\nPattindla (silk house).--An exogamous sept of Tota Balija.\r\n\r\nPattola Menon.--Recorded, in the Cochin Census Report, 1901, as a\r\nsub-caste of Nayars, who are accountants in aristocratic families.\r\n\r\nPattukuruppu.--Recorded in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as\r\nsynonymous with Vatti, a sub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPattu Sale.--A sub-division of Sales, who weave silk (pattu) fabrics.\r\n\r\nPattuvitan.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as a\r\nsub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPatvegara.--The Patvegaras or Pattegaras (pattu, silk) of South\r\nCanara are described by Mr. H. A. Stuart [95] as \"a Canarese caste\r\nof silk weavers. They are Hindus, and worship both Siva and Vishnu,\r\nbut their special deity is Durga Paramesvari at Barkur. They wear\r\nthe sacred thread, and employ Brahmans for ceremonial purposes. They\r\nare governed by a body called the ten men, and pay allegiance to\r\nthe guru of the Ramachandra math (religious institution). They are\r\ndivided into balis (septs) and a man may not marry within his own\r\nbali. Polygamy is allowed only when a wife is barren, or suffers\r\nfrom some incurable disease, such as leprosy. The girls are married\r\nin infancy, and the binding portion of the ceremony is called dhare\r\n(see Bant). Widow marriage is not permitted, and divorce is only\r\nallowed in the case of an adulterous wife. They follow the ordinary\r\nHindu law of inheritance. The dead are cremated. The sradha (memorial)\r\nceremony is in use, and the Mahalaya ceremony for the propitiation\r\nof ancestors in general is performed annually. Female ancestors are\r\nalso worshipped every year at a ceremony called vaddap, when meals\r\nare given to married women. They eat fish but not meat, and the use\r\nof alcohol is not permitted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Mysore Census Report, 1891, the Patvegars are described as\r\n\"silk weavers who speak a corrupt Marathi conglomerate of Guzarati and\r\nHindi. They worship all the Hindu deities, especially the female energy\r\nunder the name of Sakti, to which a goat is sacrificed on the night\r\nof the Dasara festival, a Musalman slaughtering the animal. After the\r\nsacrifice, the family of the Patvegar partake of the flesh. Many of\r\ntheir females are naturally fair and handsome, but lose their beauty\r\nfrom early marriage and precocity.\" A few Pattegaras, who speak a\r\ncorrupt form of Marathi, are to be found in the Anantapur district.\r\n\r\nPavalamkatti (wearers of corals).--A sub-division of Konga Vellala.\r\n\r\nPavini.--See Vayani.\r\n\r\nPayyampati.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as a\r\nsub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPedakanti.--Pedakanti or Pedaganti is the name of a sub-division\r\nof Kapu. It is said by some to be derived from a place called\r\nPedagallu. By others it is derived from peda, turned aside, and kamma,\r\neye, indicating one who turns his eyes away from a person who speaks\r\nto him. Yet another suggestion is that it means stiff-necked.\r\n\r\nPedda (big).--A sub-division of Boya, Bagata, Konda Dora, Pattapu,\r\nand Velama.\r\n\r\nPeddammavandlu.--A fancy name taken by some Telugu beggars.\r\n\r\nPedditi.--A sub-division of Golla, some members of which earn a\r\nlivelihood by begging and flattery.\r\n\r\nPegula (intestines).--An exogamous sept of Boya.\r\n\r\nPekkan.--A division of Toda.\r\n\r\nPendukal (women).--A name applied to Deva-dasis in Travancore.\r\n\r\nPengu.--A sub-division of Poroja.\r\n\r\nPennegara.--Konkani-speaking rice-beaters in South Canara.\r\n\r\nPentiya.--The Pentiyas also call themselves Holuva and Halaba or\r\nHalba. In the Madras Census Report, 1901, they are called Pantia\r\nas well as Pentiya, and described as Oriya betel-leaf (panno)\r\nsellers. Their occupation, in the Jeypore Agency tracts, is that\r\nof cultivators. According to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao, to whom I am\r\nindebted for the following note, numbers of them migrated thither from\r\nBustar, and settled at Pentikonna, and are hence called Pentikonaya or\r\nPentiya. Their language is Halba, which is easily understood by those\r\nwho speak Oriya. They are divided into two endogamous sections, called\r\nBodo (big or genuine), and Sanno (little), of whom the latter are said\r\nto be illegitimate descendants of the former. The Bodos are further\r\nsub-divided into a series of septs, e.g., Kurum (tortoise), Bhag\r\n(tiger), Nag (cobra), and Surya (sun). The caste is highly organized,\r\nand the head of a local centre is called Bhatha Nayako. He is assisted\r\nby a Pradhani, an Umriya Nayako, and Dolayi. The caste messenger is\r\ncalled Cholano, and he carries a silver baton when he summons the\r\ncastemen to a meeting. An elaborate ceremony is performed when a\r\nperson, who has been tried by the caste council, is to be received\r\nback into the caste. He is accompanied to the bank of a stream,\r\nwhere his tongue is burnt with a gold or silver wire or ornament by\r\nthe Bhatha Nayako, and some offerings from the Jagannatha temple at\r\nPuri are given to him. He is then taken home, and provides a feast,\r\nat which the Nayako has the privilege of eating first. He has further\r\nto make a present of cloths to the assembled elders, and the four heads\r\nof the caste receive a larger quantity than the others. The feast over,\r\nhe is again taken, carrying some cooked rice, to the stream, and with\r\nit pushed therein. This ceremonial bath frees him from pollution.\r\n\r\nGirls are married either before or after puberty. A man can claim his\r\npaternal aunt's daughter in marriage. The bridegroom's party proceed,\r\nwith the bridegroom, to the bride's village, and take up their abode in\r\na separate house. They then take three cloths for the bride's mother,\r\nthree rupees for her father, and a cloth and two annas for each of\r\nher brothers, and present them together with rice, liquor, and other\r\narticles. Pandals (booths) are erected in front of the quarters of the\r\nbridal couple, that of the bridegroom being made of nine, and that of\r\nthe bride of five sal (Shorea robusta) poles, to which a pot containing\r\nmyrabolams (Terminalia fruits) and rice is tied. The couple bathe,\r\nand the bridegroom proceeds to the house of the bride. The Desari,\r\nwho officiates, dons the sacred thread, and divides the pandal into\r\ntwo by means of a screen or curtain. The couple go seven times round\r\nthe pandal, and the screen is removed. They then enter the pandal,\r\nand the Desari links their little fingers together. The day's ceremony\r\nconcludes with a feast. On the following day, the bride is conducted to\r\nthe house of the bridegroom, and they sprinkle each other with turmeric\r\nwater. They then bathe in a stream or river. Another feast is held,\r\nwith much drinking, and is followed by a wild dance. The remarriage\r\nof widows is permitted, and a younger brother may marry the widow of\r\nhis elder brother. The dead are burnt, and death pollution is observed\r\nfor ten days, during which the relatives of the deceased are fed by\r\nmembers of another sept. On the tenth day a caste feast takes place.\r\n\r\nThe Pentiyas are said [96] to distribute rice, and other things, to\r\nBrahmans, once a year on the new-moon day in the month of Bhadrapadam\r\n(September-October), and to worship a female deity named Kamilli on\r\nSaturdays. No one, I am informed, other, I presume, than a Pentiya,\r\nwould take anything from a house where she is worshipped, lest the\r\ngoddess should accompany him, and require him to become her devotee.\r\n\r\nThe caste title is Nayako.\r\n\r\nPeraka (tile).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nPerike.--This word is defined, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,\r\nas meaning literally a gunny bag, and the Perikes are summed up as\r\nbeing a Telugu caste of gunny bag (goni) weavers, corresponding to\r\nthe Janappans of the Tamil districts. Gunny bag is the popular and\r\ntrading name of the coarse sacking and sacks made from the fibre\r\nof jute, much used in Indian trade. It is noted, in the Census\r\nReport, 1891, that \"the Perikes claim to be a separate caste, but\r\nthey seem to be in reality a sub-division, and not a very exalted\r\nsub-division, of Balijas, being in fact identical with the Uppu (salt)\r\nBalijas. Their hereditary occupation is carrying salt, grain, etc.,\r\non bullocks and donkeys in perikes or packs. Perike is found among\r\nthe sub-divisions of both Kavarai and Balija. Some of them, however,\r\nhave attained considerable wealth, and now claim to be Kshatriyas,\r\nsaying that they are the descendants of the Kshatriyas who ran away\r\n(piriki, a coward) from the persecution of Parasurama. Others again\r\nsay they are Kshatriyas who went into retirement, and made hills\r\n(giri) their abode (puri).\" These Perike 'Kshatriyas' are known as\r\nPuragiri Kshatriya and Giri Razu. The Periki Balijas are described, in\r\nthe Vizagapatam Manual, as chiefly carrying on cultivation and trade,\r\nand some of them are said to hold a high position at 'the Presidency'\r\n(Madras) and in the Vizagapatam district.\r\n\r\nPerike women appear to have frequently committed sati (or suttee) on\r\nthe death of their husbands in former days, and the names of those who\r\nthus sacrificed their lives are still held in reverence. A peculiar\r\ncustom among the Perikes is the erection of big square structures\r\n(brindavanam), in which a tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) is planted, on\r\nthe spot where the ashes of the dead are buried after cremation. I\r\nam informed that a fine series of these structures may be seen at\r\nChipurapalli, close to Vizianagram. As a mark of respect to the dead,\r\npassers-by usually place a lac bangle or flowers thereon. The usual\r\ntitles of the Perikes are Anna and Ayya, but some style themselves\r\nRao (= Raya, king) or Rayadu, in reference to their alleged Kshatriya\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nFor the following note on the Perikes of the Godavari district, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. F. R. Hemingway. \"Like some of the Kammas, they claim\r\nto be of Kshatriya stock, and say they are of the lineage of Parasu\r\nRama, but were driven out by him for kidnapping his sister, while\r\npretending to be gunny-bag weavers. They say that they were brought to\r\nthis country by king Nala of the Mahabharata, in gratitude for their\r\nhaving taken care of his wife Damayanti when he quitted her during\r\nhis misfortunes. They support the begging caste of Varugu Bhattas,\r\nwho, they say, supported them during their exile, and to whom they\r\ngave a sanad (deed of grant) authorising them to demand alms. These\r\npeople go round the Perike houses for their dues every year. The Pisu\r\nPerikes, who still weave gunny-bags, are said not to belong to the\r\ncaste proper, members of which style themselves Racha Perikes.\r\n\r\n\"The Perikes say that, like the Komatis, they have 101 gotras. Their\r\nmarriage ceremonies are peculiar. On the day of the wedding,\r\nthe bride and bridegroom are made to fast, as also are three male\r\nrelatives, whom they call suribhaktas. At the marriage, the couple\r\nsit on a gunny-bag, and another gunny, on which a representation\r\nof the god Mailar is drawn or painted, is spread between them. The\r\nsame god is drawn on two pots, and these, and also a third pot, are\r\nfilled with rice and dhal (Cajanus indicus), which are cooked by two\r\nmarried women. The food is then offered to Mailar. Next, the three\r\nsuribhaktas take 101 cotton threads, fasten them together, and tie\r\nseven knots in them. The bride and bridegroom are given cloths which\r\nhave been partly immersed in water coloured with turmeric and chunam\r\n(lime), and the suribhaktas are fed with the rice and dhal cooked in\r\nthe pots. The couple are then taken round the village in procession,\r\nand, on their return, the knotted cotton threads are tied round the\r\nbride's neck instead of a tali.\r\n\r\nSome Perikes style themselves Sathu vandlu, meaning a company of\r\nmerchants or travellers.\r\n\r\nPerike Muggula is the name of a class of Telugu mendicants and\r\nexorcists.\r\n\r\nPeriya (big).--Periya or Periyanan has been recorded as a sub-division\r\nof Karalan, Kunnuvan, Occhan, and Pattanavan. The equivalent Peru or\r\nPerum occurs as a sub-division of the Malayalam Kollans and Vannans\r\nand Perim of Kanikars. Periya illom is the name of an exogamous illom\r\nof Kanikars in Travancore.\r\n\r\nPerugadannaya (bandicoot rat sept).--An exogamous sept of Bant.\r\n\r\nPerum Tali (big tali).--A sub-division of Idaiyan, and of Kaikolans,\r\nwhose women wear a big tali (marriage badge).\r\n\r\nPerumal.--Perumal is a synonym of Vishnu, and the name is taken by\r\nsome Pallis who are staunch Vaishnavites. A class of mendicants,\r\nwho travel about exhibiting performing bulls in the southern part\r\nof the Madras Presidency, is known as Perumal Madukkaran or Perumal\r\nErudukkaran. Perumalathillom, meaning apparently big mountain house,\r\nis an exogamous sept or illom of the Kanikars of Travancore.\r\n\r\nPesala (seeds of Phaseolus Mungo: green gram).--An exogamous sept\r\nof Jogi.\r\n\r\nPeta (street).--A sub-division of Balija.\r\n\r\nPettigeyavaru (box).--A sub-division of Gangadikara Vakkaliga.\r\n\r\nPichiga (sparrow).--An exogamous sept of Boya and Devanga. The\r\nequivalent Pital occurs as a sept of Mala.\r\n\r\nPichigunta.--The name Pichigunta means literally an assembly of\r\nbeggars, who are described [97] as being, in the Telugu country, a\r\nclass of mendicants, who are herbalists, and physic people for fever,\r\nstomach-ache, and other ailments. They beat the village drums, relate\r\nstories and legends, and supply the place of a Herald's Office, as\r\nthey have a reputation for being learned in family histories, and\r\nmanufacture pedigrees and gotras (house names) for Kapus, Kammas,\r\nGollas, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Picchai or Pinchikuntar are described in the Salem Manual as\r\n\"servants to the Kudianavars or cultivators--a name commonly assumed\r\nby Vellalas and Pallis. The story goes that a certain Vellala had a\r\nhundred and two children, of whom only one was a female. Of the males,\r\none was lame, and his hundred brothers made a rule that one would\r\nprovide him with one kolagam of grain and one fanam (a coin) each\r\nyear. They got him married to a Telugu woman of a different caste,\r\nand the musicians who attended the ceremony were paid nothing, the\r\nbrothers alleging that, as the bridegroom was a cripple, the musicians\r\nshould officiate from charitable motives. The descendants of this\r\nmarried pair, having no caste of their own, became known as Picchi\r\nor Pinchikuntars (beggars, or lame). They are treated as kudipinnai\r\n(inferior) by Vellalas, and to the present day receive their prescribed\r\nmiras (fee) from the Vellala descendants of the hundred brothers, to\r\nwhom, on marriage and other festivals, they do service by relating\r\nthe genealogies of such Vellalas as they are acquainted with. Some\r\nserve the Vellalas in the fields, and others live by begging.\" [97]\r\n\r\nThe caste beggars of the Tottiyans are known as Pichiga-vadu.\r\n\r\nPidakala (cow-dung cakes or bratties).--An exogamous sept of\r\nDevanga. Dried cow-dung cakes are largely used by natives as fuel,\r\nand may be seen stuck on to the walls of houses.\r\n\r\nPidaran.--A section of Ambalavasis, who, according to Mr. Logan [98]\r\n\"drink liquor, exorcise devils, and are worshippers of Bhadrakali\r\nor of Sakti. The name is also applied to snake-catchers, and it was\r\nprobably conferred on the caste owing to the snake being an emblem\r\nof the human passion embodied in the deities they worship.\"\r\n\r\nPilapalli.--The Pilapallis are a small caste or community in\r\nTravancore, concerning which Mr. S. Subramanya Aiyar writes\r\nas follows. [99] \"The following sketch will show what trifling\r\ncircumstances are sufficient in this land of Parasurama to call a new\r\ncaste into existence. The word Pilapally is supposed to be a corruption\r\nof Belal Thalli, meaning forcibly ejected. It therefore contains,\r\nas though in a nutshell, the history of the origin of this little\r\ncommunity, which it is used to designate. In the palmy days of the\r\nChempakasseri Rajas, about the year 858 M.E., there lived at the court\r\nof the then ruling Prince at Ambalappuzha a Namburi Brahman who stood\r\nhigh in the Prince's favour, and who therefore became an eye-sore to\r\nall his fellow courtiers. The envy and hatred of the latter grew to\r\nsuch a degree that one day they put their heads together to devise\r\na plan which should at once strip him of all influence at court,\r\nand humble him in the eyes of the public. The device hit upon was\r\na strange one, and characteristic of that dim and distant past. The\r\nNamburi was the custodian of all presents made to the Prince, and as\r\nsuch it was a part of his daily work to arrange the articles presented\r\nin their proper places. It was arranged that one day a dead fish,\r\nbeautifully tied up and covered, should be placed among the presents\r\nlaid before the Prince. The victim of the plot, little suspecting\r\nthere was treachery in the air, removed all the presents as usual\r\nwith his own hand. His enemies at court, who were but waiting for an\r\nopportunity of humbling him to the dust, thereupon caused the bundle\r\nto be examined before the Prince, when it became evident that it\r\ncontained a dead fish. Now, for a Namburi to handle a dead fish was,\r\naccording to custom, sufficient to make him lose caste. On the strength\r\nof this argument, the Prince, who was himself a Brahmin, was easily\r\nprevailed upon to put the Namburi out of the pale of caste, and the\r\ncourt favourite was immediately excommunicated. There is another and\r\na slightly different version of the story, according to which the\r\nNamburi in question was the hereditary priest of the royal house,\r\nto whom fell the duty of removing and preserving the gifts. In course\r\nof time he grew so arrogant that the Prince himself wanted to get rid\r\nof him, but, the office of the priest being hereditary, he did not\r\nfind an easy way of accomplishing his cherished object, and, after\r\nlong deliberation with those at court in whom he could confide, came\r\nat last to the solution narrated above. It is this forcible ejection\r\nthat the expression Belal Thalli (afterwards changed into Pilapally)\r\nis said to import.... It appears that the unfortunate Namburi had two\r\nwives, both of whom elected to share his fate. Accordingly, the family\r\nrepaired to Paravur, a village near Kallarkode, where their royal\r\npatron made them a gift of land. Although they quitted Ambalapuzha for\r\ngood, they seem to have long owned there a madathummuri (a room in a\r\nseries, in which Brahmins from abroad once lived and traded), and are\r\nsaid to be still entitled daily to a measure of palpayasom from the\r\ntemple, a sweet pudding of milk, rice and sugar, celebrated all over\r\nMalabar for its excellence. The progeny of the family now count in\r\nall about ninety members, who live in eight or nine different houses.\"\r\n\r\nPillai.--Pillai, meaning child, is in the Tamil country primarily the\r\ntitle of Vellalas, but has, at recent times of census, been returned\r\nas the title of a number of classes, which include Agamudaiyan,\r\nAmbalakaran, Golla, Idaiyan, Nayar, Nokkan, Panisavan, Panikkan,\r\nParaiyan, Saiyakkaran, Sembadavan and Senaikkudaiyans. Pilla is\r\nfurther used as the title of the male offspring of Deva-dasis. Many\r\nParaiyan butlers of Europeans have assumed the title Pillai as an\r\nhonorific suffix to their name. So, too, have some criminal Koravas,\r\nwho pose as Vellalas.\r\n\r\nPillaikuttam.--Recorded, in the Manual of the North Arcot district,\r\nas a bastard branch of Vaniyan.\r\n\r\nPillaiyarpatti (Ganesa village).--An exogamous section or kovil of\r\nNattukottai Chetti.\r\n\r\nPilli (cat).--An exogamous sept of Chembadi, Mala, and Medara.\r\n\r\nPindari.--In the Madras Census Report, 1901, fifty-nine Pindaris are\r\nreturned as a Bombay caste of personal servants. They are more numerous\r\nin the Mysore province, where more than two thousand were returned\r\nin the same year as being engaged in agriculture and Government\r\nservice. The Pindaris were formerly celebrated as a notorious class\r\nof freebooters, who, in the seventeenth century, attached themselves\r\nto the Marathas in their revolt against Aurangzib, and for a long\r\ntime afterwards, committed raids in all directions, extending their\r\noperations to Southern India. It is on record that \"in a raid made upon\r\nthe coast extending from Masulipatam northward, the Pindaris in ten\r\ndays plundered 339 villages, burning many, killing and wounding 682\r\npersons, torturing 3,600, and carrying off or destroying property to\r\nthe amount of £250,000.\" [100] They were finally suppressed, in Central\r\nIndia, during the Viceroyalty of the Marquis of Hastings, in 1817.\r\n\r\nPindi (flour).--An exogamous sept of Mala.\r\n\r\nPinjari (cotton-cleaner).--A synonym for Dudekula. Pinjala (cotton)\r\noccurs as an exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nPippala (pepper: Piper longum).--An exogamous sept or gotra of Gamalla\r\nand Komati.\r\n\r\nPisharati.--The Pisharatis or Pisharodis are summed up in the Madras\r\nCensus Report, 1901, as being a sub-caste of Ambalavasis, which\r\nmakes flower garlands, and does menial service in the temples. As\r\nregards their origin, the legend runs to the effect that a Swamiyar,\r\nor Brahman ascetic, once had a disciple of the same caste, who wished\r\nto become a Sanyasi or anchorite. All the ceremonies prior to shaving\r\nthe head of the novice were completed, when, alarmed at the prospect\r\nof a cheerless life and the severe austerities incidental thereto,\r\nhe made himself scarce. Pishara denotes a Sanyasi's pupil, and as he,\r\nafter running away, was called Pisharodi, the children born to him of\r\na Parasava woman by a subsequent marriage were called Pisharatis. In\r\nhis 'Early Sovereigns of Travancore,' Mr. Sundaram Pillay says that\r\nthe Pisharati's \"puzzling position among the Malabar castes, half\r\nmonk and half layman, is far from being accounted for by the silly\r\nand fanciful modern derivation of Pisharakal plus Odi, Pisharakal\r\nbeing more mysterious than Pisharati itself.\" It is suggested by him\r\nthat Pisharati is a corruption of Bhattaraka-tiruvadi. According to\r\nthe Jati-nirnaya, the Bhattarakas are a community degraded from the\r\nBrahmans during the Treta Yuga. As far as we are able to gather from\r\nmediæval Travancore inscriptions, an officer known as Pidara-tiruvadi\r\nwas attached to every temple. It is known that he used to receive large\r\nperquisites for temple service, and that extensive rice-lands were\r\ngiven to the Bhattakara of Nelliyur. It is noted, in the Gazetteer\r\nof Malabar, that \"the traditional etymology of the name Pisharodi\r\nrefers it to a Sanyasi novice, who, deterred by the prospects of\r\nthe hardship of life on which he was about to enter, ran away (odi)\r\nat the last moment, after he had been divested of the punul (thread),\r\nbut before he had performed the final ceremony of plunging thrice in a\r\ntank (pond), and of plucking out, one at each plunge, the last three\r\nhairs of his kudumi (the rest of which had been shaved off). But the\r\ntermination 'Odi' is found in other caste titles such as Adiyodi and\r\nVallodi, and the definition is obviously fanciful, while it does not\r\nexplain the meaning of Pishar.\"\r\n\r\nThe houses of Pisharatis are called pisharam. Their primary\r\noccupation is to prepare garlands of flowers for Vaishnava temples,\r\nbut they frequently undertake the talikazhakam or sweeping service\r\nin temples. Being learned men, and good Sanskrit scholars, they\r\nare employed as Sanskrit and Malayalam tutors in the families of\r\nthose of high rank, and, in consequence, make free use of the title\r\nAsan. They are strict Vaishnavites, and the ashtakshara, or eight\r\nletters relating to Vishnu, as opposed to the panchakshara or five\r\nletters relating to Siva, forms their daily hymn of prayer. They\r\nact as their own caste priests, but for the punyaha or purificatory\r\nceremony and the initiation into the ashtakshara, which are necessary\r\non special occasions, the services of Brahmans are engaged.\r\n\r\nThe Pisharatis celebrate the tali-kettu ceremony before the girl\r\nreaches puberty. The most important item therein is the joining of\r\nthe hands of the bride and bridegroom. The planting of a jasmine\r\nshoot is observed as an indispensable preliminary rite. The events\r\nbetween this and the joining of hands are the same as with other\r\nAmbalavasis. The bride and bridegroom bathe, and wear clothes touched\r\nby each other. The girl's mother then gives her a wedding garland\r\nand a mirror, with which she sits, her face covered with a cloth. The\r\ncherutali, or marriage ornament, is tied by the bridegroom round the\r\ngirl's neck. If this husband dies, the tali has to be removed, and the\r\nwidow observes pollution. Her sons have to make oblations of cooked\r\nrice, and, for all social and religious purposes, the woman is regarded\r\nas a widow, though she is not debarred from contracting a sambandham\r\n(alliance) with a man of her own caste, or a Brahman. If the wife\r\ndies, the husband has, in like manner, to observe pollution, and make\r\noblations of cooked rice. There are cases in which the tali-kettu is\r\nperformed by a Pisharati, and sambandham contracted with a Brahman. If\r\nthe tali-tier becomes the husband, no separate cloth-giving ceremony\r\nneed be gone through by him after the girl has reached puberty.\r\n\r\nInheritance is in the female line, so much so that a wife and\r\nchildren are not entitled to compensation for the performance of a\r\nman's funeral rites.\r\n\r\nNo particular month is fixed for the name-giving rite, as it suffices\r\nif this is performed before the annaprasana ceremony. The maternal\r\nuncle first names the child. When it is four or six months old, it\r\nis taken out to see the sun. On the occasion of the annaprasana,\r\nwhich usually takes place in the sixth month, the maternal uncle\r\ngives the first mouthful of cooked rice to the child by means of\r\na golden ring. The Yatrakali serves as the night's entertainment\r\nfor the assembled guests. Nambutiris are invited to perform the\r\npurificatory ceremony known as punyaha, but the consecrated water is\r\nonly sprinkled over the roof of the house. The inmates thereof protrude\r\ntheir heads beneath the eaves so as to get purified, as the Brahmans\r\ndo not pour the water over them. The chaula or tonsure takes place at\r\nthe third year of a child's life. The maternal uncle first touches\r\nthe boy's head with a razor, and afterwards the Maran and barber do\r\nthe same. The initiation into the ashtakshara takes place at the age\r\nof sixteen. On an auspicious day, a Brahman brings a pot of water,\r\nconsecrated in a temple, to the pisharam, and pours its contents on\r\nthe head of the lad who is to be initiated. The ceremony is called\r\nkalasam-ozhuk-kua, or letting a pot of water flow. After the teaching\r\nof the ashtakshara, the youth, dressed in religious garb, makes a\r\nceremonial pretence of proceeding on a pilgrimage to Benares, as a\r\nBrahman does at the termination of the Brahmacharya stage of life. It\r\nis only after this that a Pisharati is allowed to chew betel leaf,\r\nand perform other acts, which constitute the privileges of a Grihastha.\r\n\r\nThe funeral rites of the Pisharatis are very peculiar. The corpse\r\nis seated on the ground, and a nephew recites the ashtakshara, and\r\nprostrates himself before it. The body is bathed, and dressed. A\r\ngrave, nine feet deep and three feet square, is dug in a corner of\r\nthe grounds, and salt and ashes, representing all the Panchabhutas,\r\nare spread. The corpse is placed in the grave in a sitting posture. As\r\nin the case of a Sanyasi, who is a Jivanmukta, or one liberated from\r\nthe bondage of the flesh though alive in body, so a dead Pisharati is\r\nbelieved to have no suitable body requiring to be entertained with any\r\npost-mortem offerings. A few memorial rites are, however, performed. On\r\nthe eleventh day, a ceremony corresponding to the ekoddishta sradh of\r\nthe Brahman is carried out. A knotted piece of kusa grass, representing\r\nthe soul of the deceased, is taken to a neighbouring temple, where a\r\nlighted lamp, symbolical of Maha Vishnu is worshipped, and prayers are\r\noffered. This ceremony is repeated at the end of the first year. [101]\r\n\r\nSome Pisharatis are large land-owners of considerable wealth and\r\ninfluence.

The Samantiyas also frequently give\r\nit as the name of their caste.\r\n\r\nPoduval.--Defined by Mr. Wigram [103] as one of the Ambalavasi castes,\r\nthe members of which are as a rule employed as temple watchmen. Writing\r\nconcerning the Mussads or Muttatus, Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar states\r\nthat they are known as Muttatus or Mussatus in Travancore and Cochin,\r\nand Potuvals (or Poduvals) or Akapotuvals in North Malabar. Potuval\r\nmeans a common person, i.e., the representative of a committee, and\r\na Muttatu's right to this name accrues from the fact that, in the\r\nabsence of the Nambutiri managers of a temple, he becomes their agent,\r\nand is invested with authority to exercise all their functions. The\r\nwork of an Akapotuval always lies within the inner wall of the shrine,\r\nwhile that of the Purappotuval, or Potuval proper, lies outside. From\r\nTravancore, Poduvan or Potuvan is recorded as a synonym or sub-division\r\nof Marans, who are employed at funerals by various castes.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that \"Pura Pothuvals\r\nare of two classes, Chenda Pothuvals or drum Pothuvals, and Mala\r\nPothuvals or garland Pothuvals, the names of course referring to the\r\nnature of the service which they have to render in the temple. The\r\nChenda Pothuvals would appear to be closely connected with the\r\nMarars or Marayars, who are also drummers. Mala Pothuvals follow\r\nmarumakkattayam (inheritance in the female line), their women having\r\nsambandham (alliance) with men of their own caste or with Brahmans,\r\nwhile the men can have sambandham in their own caste, or with Nayar\r\nwomen of any of the sub-divisions below Kiriyattil. Their women are\r\ncalled Pothuvarassiar or Pothuvattimar.\" It is further recorded [104]\r\nthat, in some cases, for instance among Mala Pothuvals and Marars\r\nin South Malabar, a fictitious consummation is an incident of the\r\ntali-kettu ; the girl and manavalan (bridegroom) being made to lie\r\non a bed together, and left there alone for a few moments. Amongst\r\nthe Mala Pothuvals this is done twice, once on the first and once\r\non the last day, and they apparently also spend the three nights of\r\nthe ceremony in the same bed-chamber, but not alone, an Enangatti\r\nsleeping there as chaperone. In these two castes, as in most if not\r\nall others, the ceremony also entails the pollution of the girl and\r\nher bridegroom. Amongst the Marars, they are purified by a Nambudiri\r\nafter they leave their quasi-nuptial couch. Amongst the Mala Pothuvals,\r\nthey are not allowed to bathe or to touch others during the wedding\r\ntill the fourth day, when they are given mattu (change of cloths)\r\nby the Veluttedan.\"\r\n\r\nPodala occurs as a Canarese form of Poduval.\r\n\r\nPogandan.--A synonym of Pondan.\r\n\r\nPokanati.--Pokanati or Pakanati is a sub-division of Kapu.\r\n\r\nPoladava.--A synonym of Gatti.\r\n\r\nPoligar (feudal chief).--A synonym of Palayakkaran. According to Yule\r\nand Burnell, [105] the Poligars \"were properly subordinate feudal\r\nchiefs, occupying tracts more or less wild, and generally of predatory\r\nhabits in former days. They are now much the same as Zemindars\r\n(land-owners) in the highest use of that term. The Southern Poligars\r\ngave much trouble about a hundred years ago, and the 'Poligar wars'\r\nwere somewhat serious affairs. In various assaults on Panjalamkurichi,\r\none of their forts in Tinnevelly, between 1799 and 1801, there fell\r\nfifteen British officers.\" The name Poligar was further used for the\r\npredatory classes, which served under the chiefs. Thus, in Munro's\r\n'Narrative of Military Operations' (1780-84), it is stated that\r\n\"the matchlock men are generally accompanied by Poligars, a set of\r\nfellows that are almost savages, and make use of no other weapon than\r\na pointed bamboo spear, 18 or 20 feet long.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Poligar is given to a South Indian breed of greyhound-like\r\ndogs in the Tinnevelly district.\r\n\r\nPombada.--A small class of Canarese devil-dancers, who are said,\r\n[106] in South Canara, to resemble the Nalkes, but hold a somewhat\r\nhigher position, and in devil-dances to represent a better class of\r\ndemons. Unlike the Nalkes and Paravas, they follow the aliya santana\r\nsystem of inheritance. They speak Tulu, and, in their customs,\r\nfollow those of the Billavas. There are two sections among the\r\nPombadas, viz., Bailu, who are mainly cultivators, and Padarti,\r\nwho are chiefly engaged in devil-dancing. The Pombadas are not,\r\nlike the Nalkes and Paravas, a polluting class, and are socially a\r\nlittle inferior to the Billavas. They do not wear the disguises of\r\nthe bhuthas (devils) Nicha, Varte, and Kamberlu, who are considered\r\nlow, but wear those of Jumadi, Panjurli, Jarandaya, Mahisandeya, and\r\nKodamanithaya. Ullaya or Dharmadevata is regarded as a superior bhutha,\r\nand the special bhutha of the Pombadas, who do not allow Nalkes or\r\nParavas to assume his disguise. During the Jumadi Kola (festival),\r\nthe Pombada who represents the bhutha Jumadi is seated on a cart,\r\nand dragged in procession through the streets.

Stuart writes, [107] \"only\r\ntwenty-eight persons of this caste in Malabar, and they are all in\r\nCalicut. These are the palanquin-bearers of the Zamorin. They are\r\nin dress, manners, customs, and language entirely Tamilians, and,\r\nwhile the Zamorin is polluted by the touch of any ordinary Tamilian,\r\nthese Pondans enjoy the privilege of bearing him in a palanquin\r\nto and from the temple every day. Now there is a sub-division of\r\nthe Tamil Idaiyans by name Pogondan, and I understand that these\r\nPogondans are the palanquin-bearers of the Idaiyan caste. It seems\r\nprobable that the founder, or some early member of the Zamorin,\r\nobtained palanquin-bearers of his own (cowherd) caste and granted\r\nthem privileges which no other Tamilians now enjoy.\"\r\n\r\nPondra.--Pondra, or Ponara, is a sub-division of Mali.\r\n\r\nPonganadu.--Ponganadu and Ponguvan have been recorded, at times of\r\ncensus, as a sub-division of Kapu.

Concerning them, it is noted, in the\r\nMadras Census Report, 1871, that \"there are held to be seven classes\r\nof these Parjas, which differ from each other in points of language,\r\ncustoms, and traditions. The term Parja is, as Mr. Carmichael has\r\npointed out, merely a corruption of a Sanskrit term signifying a\r\nsubject, and it is understood as such by the people themselves, who\r\nuse it in contradistinction to a free hill-man. 'Formerly,' says a\r\ntradition that runs through the whole tribe, 'Rajas and Parjas were\r\nbrothers, but the Rajas took to riding horses (or, as the Barenja\r\nParjas put it, sitting still) and we became carriers of burdens and\r\nParjas.' It is quite certain, in fact, that the term Parja is not a\r\ntribal denomination, but a class denomination, and it may be fitly\r\nrendered by the familiar epithet of ryot (cultivator). I have laid\r\nstress on this, because all native officials, and every one that has\r\nwritten about the country (with the above exception), always talk of\r\nthe term Parja as if it signified a caste. There is no doubt, however,\r\nthat by far the greater number of these Parjas are akin to the Khonds\r\nof the Ganjam Maliahs. They are thrifty, hard-working cultivators,\r\nundisturbed by the intestine broils which their cousins in the north\r\nengage in, and they bear in their breasts an inalienable reverence for\r\ntheir soil, the value of which they are rapidly becoming acquainted\r\nwith. The Parja bhumi (land) is contained almost entirely in the\r\nupper level. Parts to the south held under Pachipenta and Madugulu\r\n(Madgole) are not Parja bhumi, nor, indeed, are some villages to\r\nthe north in the possession of the Khonds. Their ancient rights to\r\nthese lands are acknowledged by colonists from among the Aryans, and,\r\nwhen a dispute arises concerning the boundaries of a field possessed\r\nby recent arrivals, a Parja is usually called in to point out the\r\nancient land-marks.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Poroja seems to be derived from the Oriya, Po, son, and Raja,\r\ni.e., sons of Rajas. There is a tradition that, at the time when the\r\nRajas of Jeypore rose into prominence at Nandapur, the country was\r\noccupied by a number of tribes, who, in return for the protection\r\npromised to them, surrendered their rights to the soil, which they\r\nhad hitherto occupied absolutely. I am informed that the Porojas,\r\nwhen asked what their caste is, use ryot and Poroja as synonymous,\r\nsaying we are Porojas; we are ryot people.\r\n\r\nThe Parji language is stated by Mr. G. A. Grierson [108] to have\r\n\"hitherto been considered as identical with Bhatri. Bhatri has now\r\nbecome a form of Oriya. Parji, on the other hand, is still a dialect\r\nof Gondi.\" The Bhatras are a tribe inhabiting the state of Bastar in\r\nthe Central Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe Porojas are not a compact caste, but rather a conglomerate, made up\r\nof several endogamous sections, and speaking a language, which varies\r\naccording to locality. These sections, according to Mr. C. Hayavadana\r\nRao, to whom I am indebted for much of the present note, are--\r\n\r\n(1) Barang Jhodia, who eat beef and speak Oriya.\r\n\r\n(2) Pengu Poroja, subdivided into those who eat the flesh of the\r\nbuffalo, and those who do not. They speak a language, which is said\r\nto bear a close resemblance to Kondhs.\r\n\r\n(3) Khondi or Kondi Poroja, who are a section of the Kondhs, eat beef\r\nand the flesh of buffaloes, and speak Kodu or Kondh.\r\n\r\n(4) Parengi Poroja, who are a section of the Gadabas. They are\r\nsubdivided into those who eat and do not eat the flesh of buffaloes,\r\nand speak a Gadaba dialect.\r\n\r\n(5) Bonda, Bunda, or Nanga Poroja, who are likewise a section of the\r\nGadabas, call themselves Bonda Gadaba, and speak a dialect of Gadaba.\r\n\r\n(6) Tagara Poroja, who are a section of the Koyas or Koyis, and speak\r\nKoya, or, in some places, Telugu.\r\n\r\n(7) Dur Poroja, also, it is said, known as Didayi Poroja, who speak\r\nOriya.\r\n\r\nAmong the Barang Jhodias, the gidda (vulture), bagh (tiger), and\r\nnag (cobra) are regarded as totems. Among the Pengu, Kondhi and\r\nDur divisions, the two last are apparently regarded as such, and,\r\nin addition to them, the Bonda Porojas have mandi (cow).\r\n\r\nIn the Barang Jhodia, Pengu, and Kondhi divisions, it is customary\r\nfor a man to marry his paternal aunt's daughter, but he cannot claim\r\nher as a matter of right, for the principle of free love is recognised\r\namong them. The dhangada and dhangadi basa system, according to which\r\nbachelors and unmarried girls sleep in separate quarters in a village,\r\nis in force among the Porojas.\r\n\r\nWhen a marriage is contemplated among the Barang Jhodias, the parents\r\nof the young man carry two pots of liquor and some rice to the parents\r\nof the girl, who accept the present, if they are favourable to the\r\nmatch. If it is accepted, the future bridegroom's party renew the\r\nproposal a year later by bringing five kunchams of rice, a new female\r\ncloth, seven uddas of liquor, and a sum of money ranging from fifteen\r\nto fifty rupees. On the following evening, the bride, accompanied\r\nby her relations, goes to the village of the bridegroom. Outside his\r\nhouse two poles have been set up, and joined together at the top by\r\na string, from which a gourd (Cucurbita maxima) is suspended. As soon\r\nas the contracting couple come before the house, a tall man cuts the\r\ngourd with his tangi (axe) and it falls to the ground. The pair then\r\nenter the house, and the bride is presented with a new cloth by the\r\nparents of the bridegroom. Opposite the bridegroom's house is a square\r\nfence, forming an enclosure, from which the bride's party watch the\r\nproceedings. They are joined by the bride and bridegroom, and the\r\nparents of the latter distribute ragi (Eleusine Corocana) liquor and\r\nippa (Bassia) liquor. A dance, in which both males and females take\r\npart, is kept up till the small hours, and, on the following day, a\r\nfeast is held. About midday, the bride is formally handed over to the\r\nbridegroom, in the presence of the Janni and Mudili (caste elders). She\r\nremains a week at her new home, and then, even though she has reached\r\npuberty, returns to her father's house, where she remains for a year,\r\nbefore finally joining her husband. In another form of marriage\r\namong the Barang Jhodias, the bride is brought to the house of the\r\nbridegroom, in front of which a pandal (booth), made of six poles,\r\nis set up. The central pole is cut from the neredi chettu (Eugenia\r\nJambolana). At the auspicious moment, which is fixed by the Disari,\r\nthe maternal uncle of the bridegroom sits with the bridegroom on his\r\nlap, and the bride at his feet. Castor-oil is then applied by the\r\nbridegroom's father, first to the bridegroom, and then to the bride. A\r\nfeast follows, at which fowls and liquor are consumed. On the following\r\nday, the newly-married couple bathe, and the ceremonies are at an end.\r\n\r\nI am informed by Mr. H. C. Daniel that there is a custom among the\r\nPorojas, and other classes in Vizagapatam (e.g., Gadabas, Ghasis,\r\nand Malis), according to which a man gives his services as a goti for\r\na specified time to another, in return for a small original loan. His\r\nmaster has to keep him supplied with food, and to pay him about two\r\nrupees at the Dussera festival, as well as making him a present of a\r\ncloth and a pair of sandals. The servant must do whatever he is told,\r\nand is practically a slave until the specified time is over. A man may\r\ngive his son as a goti, instead of himself. It is also fairly common to\r\nfind a man serving his prospective father-in-law for a specified time,\r\nin order to secure his daughter. Men from the plains, usually of the\r\nKomati caste, who have come to the hills for the purpose of trade,\r\ngo by the local name of Sundi. They are the chief upholders of the\r\ngoti system, by which they get labour cheap. Mr. Daniel has never\r\nheard of a goti refusing to do his work, the contract being by both\r\nsides considered quite inviolable. But a case was recently tried in a\r\nMunsiff's Court, in which a goti absconded from his original master,\r\nand took service with another, thereby securing a fresh loan. The\r\noriginal master sued him for the balance of labour due.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Bonda Porojas, as already indicated, connects them\r\nclosely with the Gadabas, but any such connection is stoutly denied\r\nby them. The names Bonda and Nanga mean naked, and bear reference to\r\nthe fact that the only clothing of the women is a strip of cloth made\r\nfrom setukudi or ankudi chettu, or kareng fibre. In a note on the\r\nBhondas of Jaipur, Mr. J. A. May informs us [109] that the female\r\nattire \"consists of just a piece of cloth, either made of kerong\r\nbark and manufactured by themselves, or purchased from the weavers,\r\nabout a foot square, and only sufficient to cover a part of one\r\nhip. It is attached to their waists by a string, on which it runs,\r\nand can be shifted round to any side. A most ludicrous sight has\r\noften been presented to me by a stampede among a number of these\r\nwomen, when I have happened to enter a village unexpectedly. On my\r\napproach, one and all hurried to their respective dwellings, and,\r\nas they ran in all directions, endeavoured to shift this rag round\r\nto the part most likely to be exposed to me.\" The Bonda women have\r\nglass bead and brass ornaments hung round their necks, and covering\r\ntheir bosoms. The legend, which accounts for the scanty clothing of\r\nthe Bondas, runs to the effect that, when Sita, the wife of Rama, was\r\nbathing in a river, she was seen by women of this tribe, who laughed at\r\nand mocked her. Thereon, she cursed them, and ordained that, in future,\r\nall the women should shave their heads, and wear no clothing except a\r\nsmall covering for decency's sake. There is a further tradition that,\r\nif the Bonda women were to abandon their primitive costume, the whole\r\ntribe would be destroyed by tigers. The shaving of the women's heads\r\nis carried out, with a knife lent by the village Komaro (blacksmith),\r\nby a member of the tribe. Round the head, the women wear a piece of\r\nbamboo tied behind with strings.\r\n\r\nIn one form of marriage, as carried out by the Bondas, a young man,\r\nwith some of his friends, goes to the sleeping apartment of the\r\nmaidens, where each of them selects a maid for himself. The young men\r\nand maidens then indulge in a singing contest, in which impromptu\r\nallusions to physical attributes, and bantering and repartee take\r\nplace. If a girl decides to accept a young man as her suitor, he\r\ntakes a burning stick from the night fire, and touches her breast\r\nwith it. He then withdraws, and sends one of his friends to the girl\r\nwith a brass bangle, which, after some questioning as to who sent it,\r\nshe accepts. Some months later, the man's parents go to the girl's\r\nhome, and ask for her hand on behalf of their son. A feast follows,\r\nand the girl, with a couple of girls of about her own age, goes with\r\nthe man's parents to their home. They send five kunchams of rice to\r\nthe parents of the girl, and present the two girls with a similar\r\nquantity. The three girls then return to their homes. Again several\r\nmonths elapse, and then the man's parents go to fetch the bride,\r\nand a feast and dance take place. The pair are then man and wife.\r\n\r\nIn another account of the marriage customs of the Nanga Porojas, it\r\nis stated that pits are dug in the ground, in which, during the cold\r\nseason, the children are put at night, to keep them warm. The pit\r\nis about nine feet in diameter. In the spring, all the marriageable\r\ngirls of a settlement are put into one pit, and a young man, who\r\nhas really selected his bride with the consent of his parents, comes\r\nand proposes to her. If she refuses him, he tries one after another\r\ntill he is accepted. On one occasion, a leopard jumped into the pit,\r\nand killed some of the maidens. In a note on Bhonda marriage, Mr. May\r\nwrites [110] that \"a number of youths, candidates for matrimony, start\r\noff to a village, where they hope to find a corresponding number of\r\nyoung women, and make known their wishes to the elders, who receive\r\nthem with all due ceremony. The juice of the salop (sago palm) in a\r\nfermented state is in great requisition, as nothing can be done without\r\nthe exhilarating effects of their favourite beverage. They then proceed\r\nto excavate an underground chamber (if one is not already prepared),\r\nhaving an aperture at the top, admitting of the entrance of one at\r\na time. Into this the young gentlemen, with a corresponding number\r\nof young girls, are introduced, when they grope about and make their\r\nselection, after which they ascend out of it, each holding the young\r\nlady of his choice by the forefinger of one of her hands. Bracelets\r\n(the equivalent of the wedding ring) are now put on her arms by\r\nthe elders, and two of the young men stand as sponsors for each\r\nbridegroom. The couples are then led to their respective parents,\r\nwho approve and give their consent. After another application of\r\nsalop and sundry greetings, the bridegroom is permitted to take his\r\nbride home, where she lives with him for a week, and then, returning\r\nto her parents, is not allowed to see her husband for a period of\r\none year, at the expiration of which she is finally made over to\r\nhim.\" In a still further account of marriage among the Bondas, I am\r\ninformed that a young man and a maid retire to the jungle, and light\r\na fire. Then the maid, taking a burning stick, applies it to the\r\nman's gluteal region. If he cries out Am! Am! Am! he is unworthy of\r\nher, and she remains a maid. If he does not, the marriage is at once\r\nconsummated. The application of the brand is probably light or severe\r\naccording to the girl's feelings towards the young man. According to\r\nanother version, the girl goes off to the jungle with several men, and\r\nthe scene has been described as being like a figure in the cotillion,\r\nas they come up to be switched with the brand.\r\n\r\nWidow remarriage is permitted among all the divisions of the Porojas,\r\nand a younger brother usually marries his elder brother's widow.\r\n\r\nThe Jhodia, Pengu, and Kondhi divisions worship Bhumi Devata (the\r\nearth goddess), who is also known as Jakar Devata, once in three\r\nyears. Each village offers a cow, goat, pig, and pigeon to her as\r\na sacrifice. She is represented by a stone under a tree outside the\r\nvillage. A casteman acts as pujari (priest), and all the villagers,\r\nincluding the Janni and Mudili, are present at the festival, which\r\nwinds up with a feast and drink. The Bondas worship Takurani in the\r\nmonths of Chaitra and Magho, and the festival includes the sacrifice\r\nof animals. \"Their religious ceremonies,\" Mr. May writes, \"consist\r\nin offerings to some nameless deity, or to the memory of deceased\r\nrelations. At each of the principal villages, the Bhondas congregate\r\nonce a year in some spot conveniently situated for their orgies, when\r\na chicken, a few eggs, and a pig or goat are offered, after which they\r\nretire to their houses, and next day assemble again, when the salop\r\njuice is freely imbibed till the intoxicating effects have thoroughly\r\nroused their pugnacity. The process of cudgelling one another with the\r\nbranches of the salop now begins, and they apply them indiscriminately\r\nwithout the smallest regard for each other's feelings. This, with the\r\nattendant drums and shrieks, would give one the impression of a host\r\nof maniacs suddenly set at liberty. This amusement is continued till\r\nbruises, contusions, and bleeding heads and backs have reduced them to\r\na comparatively sober state, and, I imagine, old scores are paid off,\r\nwhen they return to their several houses.\"\r\n\r\nThe dead are, as a rule, burnt. By some of the Jhodia Porojas, the\r\nashes are subsequently buried in a pit a few feet deep, near the\r\nburning-ground, and the grave is marked by a heap of stones. A pole\r\nis set up in this heap, and water poured on it for twelve days. On\r\nthe fourth day, cooked rice and fish are set on the way leading to\r\nthe spot where the corpse was burned. The celebrants of the death\r\nrite then take mango bark, paint it with cow-dung, and sprinkle\r\nthemselves with it. The ceremony concludes with a bath, feast, and\r\ndrink. Among the Bonda Porojas, some of the jewelry of the deceased\r\nperson is burnt with the corpse, and the remainder given to the\r\ndaughter or daughter-in-law. They observe pollution for three days,\r\nduring which they do not enter their fields. On the fourth day,\r\nthey anoint themselves with castor-oil and turmeric, and bathe.\r\n\r\nMr. G. F. Paddison informs me that he once gave medicine to the Porojas\r\nduring an epidemic of cholera in a village. They all took it eagerly,\r\nbut, as he was going away, asked whether it would not be quicker cure\r\nto put the witch in the next village, who had brought on the cholera,\r\ninto jail.\r\n\r\nA Bonda Poroja dance is said to be very humourous. The young men tie\r\na string of bells round their legs, and do the active part of the\r\ndance. The women stand in a cluster, with faces to the middle, clap\r\ntheir hands, and scream at intervals, while the men hop and stamp, and\r\nwhirl round them on their own axes. The following account of a dance\r\nby the Jhodia Poroja girls of the Koraput and Nandapuram country is\r\ngiven by Mr. W. Francis. [111] \"Picturesque in the extreme,\" he writes,\r\n\"is a dancing party of these cheery maidens, dressed all exactly alike\r\nin clean white cloths with cerise borders or checks, reaching barely\r\nhalf way to the knee; great rings on their fingers; brass bells on\r\ntheir toes; their substantial but shapely arms and legs tattooed from\r\nwrist to shoulder, and from ankle to knee; their left forearms hidden\r\nunder a score of heavy brass bangles; and their feet loaded with\r\nchased brass anklets weighing perhaps a dozen pounds. The orchestra,\r\nwhich consists solely of drums of assorted shapes and sizes, dashes\r\ninto an overture, and the girls quickly group themselves into a couple\r\nof corps de ballet, each under the leadership of a première danseuse,\r\nwho marks the time with a long baton of peacock's feathers. Suddenly,\r\nthe drums drop to a muffled beat, and each group strings out into a\r\nlong line, headed by the leader with the feathers, each maiden passing\r\nher right hand behind the next girl's back, and grasping the left elbow\r\nof the next but one. Thus linked, and in time with the drums (which\r\nnow break into allegro crescendo), the long chain of girls--dancing\r\nin perfect step, following the leader with her swaying baton, marking\r\nthe time by clinking their anklets (right, left, right, clink; left,\r\nclink; right, left, right, clink; and so da capo), chanting the while\r\n(quite tunefully) in unison a refrain in a minor key ending on a\r\nsustained falling note--weave themselves into sinuous lines, curves,\r\nspirals, figures-of-eight, and back into lines again; wind in and\r\nout like some brightly-coloured snake; never halting for a moment,\r\nnow backwards, now forwards, first slowly and decorously, then,\r\nas the drums quicken, faster and faster, with more and more abandon,\r\nand longer and longer steps, until suddenly some one gets out of step,\r\nand the chain snaps amid peals of breathless laughter.\"\r\n\r\nFor the following supplementary note on the Bonda Porojas, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. C. A. Henderson.\r\n\r\nThese people live in the western portion of Malkanagiri taluk,\r\nalong the edge of the hills, probably penetrating some distance into\r\nthem. The elder men are not in any way distinguishable from their\r\nneighbours. Young unmarried men, however, tie a strip of palmyra leaf\r\nround their heads in the same way as the women of their own tribe, or\r\nof the Gadabas. The women are very distinctly dressed. They all shave\r\ntheir heads once a month or so, and fasten a little fillet, made of\r\nbeads or plaited grass, round them. The neck and chest are covered with\r\na mass of ornaments, by which the breasts are almost concealed. These\r\nconsist, for the most part, of bead necklaces, but they have also one\r\nor more very heavy brass necklaces of various designs, some being\r\nmerely collections of rings on a connecting circlet, some massive\r\nhinged devices tied together at the end with string. They wear also\r\nsmall ear-studs of lead. Apart from these ornaments, they are naked\r\nto the waist. Round the loins, a small thick cloth is worn. This is\r\nwoven from the fibre of the ringa (Oriya sitkodai gotsho). This cloth\r\nmeasures about two feet by eight inches, and is of thick texture like\r\ngunny, and variously coloured. Owing to its exiguity, its wearers are\r\ncompelled, for decency's sake, to sit on their heels with their knees\r\ntogether, instead of squatting in the ordinary native posture. This\r\nlittle cloth is supported round the waist by a thread, or light chain\r\nof tin and beads, but not totally confined thereby. The upper edge of\r\nthe cloth behind is free from the chain, and bulges out, exposing the\r\nupper portion of the buttocks, the thread or chain lying in the small\r\nof the back. It is noted by Mr. Sandell that \"the cloth at present\r\nused is of comparatively recent introduction, and seems to be a slight\r\ninfringement of the tabu. The original cloth and supporting string were\r\nundoubtedly made of jungle fibre, and the modern colouring is brought\r\nabout with cotton thread. Similarly, the Bonda Poroja necklaces of\r\ncheap beads, blue and white, must be modern, and most obviously so\r\nthe fragments of tin that they work into their chains. The women are\r\nsaid to wear cloths in their houses, but to leave them off when they\r\ngo outside. It seems that the tabu is directed against appearing in\r\npublic fully clothed, and not against wearing decent sized cloths, as\r\nsuch. The party I saw were mostly unmarried girls, but one of them had\r\nbeen married for a year. When not posing for the camera, or dancing,\r\nshe tied a small piece of cloth round her neck, so as to hang over\r\nthe shoulders. This, as far as I could make out, was not because she\r\nwas married, but simply because she was more shy than the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Two houses are kept in the village, for the unmarried girls and young\r\nmen respectively. Apparently marriages are matters of inclination,\r\nthe parents having no say in the matter. The young couple having\r\ncontracted friendship (by word of mouth, and not by deed, as it was\r\nexplained to me), inform their parents of it. The young man goes to\r\nmake his demand of the girl's parents, apparently without at the time\r\nmaking any presents to them, contrary to the custom of the Kondhs and\r\nothers. Then there seem to be a series of promises on the part of the\r\nparents to give the girl. But the witnesses were rather confused on the\r\npoint. I gather that the sort of final betrothal takes place in Dyali\r\n(the month after Dusserah), and the marriage in Magha. At the time\r\nof marriage, the girl's parents are presented with a pair of bulls,\r\na cloth, and a pot of landa (sago-palm toddy). But no return is made\r\nfor them. The father gives the girl some ornaments. The married woman,\r\nwhom I saw, had been given a bracelet by her husband, but it was not a\r\nconspicuously valuable one, and in no way indicative of her status.\" In\r\nconnection with marriage, Mr. Sandell adds that \"a youth of one village\r\ndoes not marry a maiden of the same village, as they are regarded as\r\nbrother and sister. The marriage pit is still in use, and may last\r\nall through the cold weather. A number of small villages will club\r\ntogether, and have one big pit.\" In the case observed by Mr. Sandell,\r\nthree of the local maidens were shut up in the pit at night, and\r\nfive stranger youths admitted. The pit may be twelve feet across,\r\nand is covered with tatties (mats) and earth, a trap-door being left.\r\n\r\n\"After childbirth, the mother is unclean for some days. The time is,\r\nI gather, reckoned by the dropping of the navel-string, and is given\r\nas eight to sixteen days. During that period, the woman is not allowed\r\nto cook, or even touch her meals.\r\n\r\n\"These people say that they have no puja (worship). But at the time of\r\nsowing seed, they sacrifice one egg (for the whole village) to Matera\r\nHundi, the goddess of harvest, who is represented by a branch of the\r\nkusi or jamo (guava) tree planted in the village. The people have\r\nno pujaris, and, in this case, the priest was a Mattia by caste. He\r\nplants the branch, and performs the sacrifice. At the time of Nua\r\nKhau (new eating; first fruits) a sacrifice of an animal of some kind\r\nis also made to Matera Hundi. Her aid is, they say, sought against\r\nthe perils of the jungle, but primarily she is wanted to give them a\r\ngood crop. The Bonda Porojas are quite ready to tell the old story of\r\nSita (whom they call Maha Lakshmi), and her curse upon their women,\r\nwhereby they shave their heads, and may not wear cloths. It is stated\r\nby Mr. May that a Government Agent once insisted on a young woman\r\nbeing properly clothed, and she survived the change only three days. I\r\nunderstand that this case has been somewhat misrepresented. The cloth\r\nis believed not to have been forced upon the girl, but offered to, and\r\ngreatly appreciated by her. Her death shortly afterwards was apparently\r\nnot the result of violation of the tabu, but accidental, and due,\r\nit is believed, to small-pox. The people whom I saw had not heard\r\nof this episode, but said that a woman who wore a cloth out of doors\r\nwould fall sick, not die. But the possibility of any woman of theirs\r\nwearing a cloth obviously seemed to them very remote. The Bonda Porojas\r\nhave a sort of belief in ghosts--not altogether devils apparently,\r\nbut the spirits of the departed (sayire). These may appear in dreams,\r\ninfluence life and health, and vaguely exercise a helpful influence\r\nover the crops. I did not find out if they were propitiated in any way.\r\n\r\n\"A dead body is washed, tied to a tatty (mat) hurdle, taken outside\r\nthe village, and burnt. After eight days (said to be four in the\r\ncase of rich men), the corpse-bearers, and the family, sit down to a\r\nfuneral feast, at which drinking is not allowed. A pig, fowl, or goat,\r\naccording to the circumstances of the family, forms the meal. This\r\nis done in some way for the sake of the departed, but how is not\r\nquite clear.\r\n\r\n\"The Bonda Porojas live by cultivation, keep cattle, pigs, etc.,\r\nand eat beef, and even the domestic pig. They pride themselves, as\r\nagainst their Hindu neighbours, in that their women eat with the men,\r\nand not of their leavings, and do not leave their village. The women,\r\nhowever, go to shandies (markets).\"\r\n\r\nPothoria.--Pothoria or Pothriya, meaning stone, is the name of a small\r\nclass of Oriya stone-cutters in Ganjam, who are addicted to snaring\r\nantelopes by means of tame bucks, which they keep for the purpose of\r\ndecoying the wild ones. They employ Brahmans as purohits. Marriage\r\nis infant, and remarriage of widows is permitted. The females wear\r\nglass bangles.\r\n\r\nPothu.--Pothu or Pothula, meaning male, occurs as an exogamous sept\r\nof Devanga, Medara, and Padma Sale; and Pothula, in the sense of a\r\nmale buffalo, as a sept of Madiga.\r\n\r\nPotia.--Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as Oriya\r\nmat-makers. They are said to be immigrants from Potia in Orissa, who\r\ncall themselves Doluvas. The Doluvas, however, do not recognise them,\r\nand neither eat nor intermarry with them.\r\n\r\nPotta (abdomen).--An exogamous sept of Boya.\r\n\r\nPotti (Tamil, worshipful).--Stated, in the Travancore Census Report,\r\n1901, to be the name applied to all Kerala Brahmans, who do not come\r\nunder the specific designation of Nambutiris.\r\n\r\nPouzu (quail).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nPowaku (tobacco).--An exogamous sept of Mala.\r\n\r\nPoyilethannaya (one who removes the evil eye).--An exogamous sept\r\nof Bant.\r\n\r\nPradhano (chief).--A title of Aruva, Benaiyto, Odia, Kalingi, Kevuto,\r\nand Samantiya.\r\n\r\nPranopakari (one who helps souls).--A name for barbers in\r\nTravancore. In the early settlement records, Pranu occurs as a\r\ncorruption thereof.\r\n\r\nPrathamasakha.--It is recorded, [112] in connection with the village of\r\nKoiltirumalam or Tiru-ambamahalam, that \"a new temple has been recently\r\nbuilt, and richly endowed by Nattukottai Chettis. There is, however,\r\nan old story connected with the place, which is enacted at the largely\r\nattended festival here, and in many popular dramas. This relates that\r\nthe god of the Tiruvalur temple was entreated by a pujari (priest)\r\nof this place to be present in the village at a sacrifice in his (the\r\ngod's) honour. The deity consented at length, but gave warning that he\r\nwould come in a very unwelcome shape. He appeared as a Paraiyan with\r\nbeef on his back and followed by the four Vedas in the form of dogs,\r\nand took his part in the sacrifice thus accoutred and attended. All\r\nthe Brahmans who were present ran away, and the god was so incensed\r\nthat he condemned them to be Paraiyans for one hour in the day, from\r\nnoon till 1 P.M. ever afterwards. There is a class of Brahmans called\r\nMidday Brahmans, who are found in several districts, and a colony\r\nof whom reside at Sedanipuram, five miles west of Nannilam. It is\r\nbelieved throughout the Tanjore district that the Midday Paraiyans\r\nare the descendants of the Brahmans thus cursed by the god. They are\r\nsupposed to expiate their defilement by staying outside their houses\r\nfor an hour and a half every day at midday, and to bathe afterwards;\r\nand, if they do this, they are much respected. Few of them, however,\r\nobserve this rule, and orthodox persons will not eat with them, because\r\nof this omission to remove the defilement. They call themselves the\r\nPrathamasakha.\"\r\n\r\nPrithvi (earth).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nPuchcha.--Puccha or Puchcha Kaya (fruit of Citrullus Colocynthis)\r\nis the name of a gotra or sept of Boyas, Komatis, and Viramushtis,\r\nwho are a class of mendicants attached to the Komatis. The same name,\r\nor picchi kaya, denoting the water-melon Citrullus vulgaris, occurs\r\nas a sept or house-name of Panta Reddis and Seniyans (Devangas),\r\nthe members of which may not eat the fruit. The name Desimarada has\r\nbeen recently substituted by the Seniyans for picchi kaya.\r\n\r\nPudamuri (pudaya, a woman's cloth; muri, cuttings).--Defined by\r\nMr. Wigram as a so-called 'marriage' ceremony performed among the\r\nNayars in North Malabar. (See Nayar.)\r\n\r\nPudu Nattan (new country).--A sub-division of Idaiyan.\r\n\r\nPu Islam.--See Putiya Islam.\r\n\r\nPujari.--Pujari is an occupational title, meaning priest, or performer\r\nof puja (worship). It is described by Mr. H. A. Stuart [113] as\r\n\"a name applied to a class of priests, who mostly preside in the\r\ntemples of the female deities--the Grama Devatas or Ur Ammas--and\r\nnot in those of Vishnu or Siva. They do not wear the sacred thread,\r\nexcept on solemn occasions.\" Pujari has been recorded as a title of\r\nBillavas as they officiate as priests at bhutasthanas (devil shrines),\r\nand of Halepaiks, and Pujali as a title of some Irulas. Some families\r\nof Kusavans (potters), who manufacture clay idols, are also known as\r\npujari. Puja occurs as a sub-division of the Gollas. Some criminal\r\nKoravas travel in the guise of Pujaris, and style themselves Korava\r\nPujaris.\r\n\r\nPula.--A sub-division of Cheruman.\r\n\r\nPula (flowers).--An exogamous sept of Boya, Padma Sale and Yerukala.\r\n\r\nPulan.--Barbers of Tamil origin, who have settled in Travancore.\r\n\r\nPulavar.--A title of Occhan and Panisavan.\r\n\r\nPulayan.--See Cheruman and Thanda Pulayan.\r\n\r\nPuli (tiger).--Recorded as an exogamous sept or gotra of Balija,\r\nGolla, Kamma, and Medara. The equivalent Puliattanaya occurs as an\r\nexogamous sept of Bant.\r\n\r\nPuliakodan.--A class of carpenters in Malabar, whose traditional\r\noccupation is to construct oil mills.\r\n\r\nPuliasari.--A division of Malabar Kammalans, the members of which\r\ndo mason's work (puli, earth). Paravas who are engaged in a similar\r\ncalling are, in like manner, called Puli Kollan.\r\n\r\nPulikkal.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as a\r\nsub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPuliyan.--A sub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPuliyattu.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as\r\nsynonymous with Pulikkappanikkan, a sub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPullakura (pot-herbs).--An exogamous sept of Idiga.\r\n\r\nPulluvan.--The Pulluvans of Malabar are astrologers, medicine-men,\r\npriests and singers in snake groves. The name is fancifully derived\r\nfrom pullu, a hawk, because the Pulluvan is clever in curing the\r\ndisorders which pregnant women and babies suffer from through the evil\r\ninfluence of these birds. The Pulluvans are sometimes called Vaidyans\r\n(physicians).\r\n\r\nAs regards the origin of the caste, the following tradition is\r\nnarrated. [114] Agni, the fire god, had made several desperate but vain\r\nefforts to destroy the great primeval forest of Gandava. The eight\r\nserpents which had their home in the forest were the chosen friends\r\nof Indra, who sent down a deluge, and destroyed, every time, the fire\r\nwhich Agni kindled in order to burn down the forest. Eventually Agni\r\nresorted to a stratagem, and, appearing before Arjunan in the guise\r\nof a Brahman, contrived to exact a promise to do him any favour he\r\nmight desire. Agni then sought the help of Arjunan in destroying\r\nthe forest, and the latter created a wonderful bow and arrows, which\r\ncut off every drop of rain sent by Indra for the preservation of the\r\nforest. The birds, beasts, and other creatures which lived therein,\r\nfled in terror, but most of them were overtaken by the flames, and\r\nwere burnt to cinders. Several of the serpents also were overtaken\r\nand destroyed, but one of them was rescued by the maid-servant of a\r\nBrahman, who secured the sacred reptile in a pot, which she deposited\r\nin a jasmine bower. When the Brahman came to hear of this, he had\r\nthe serpent removed, and turned the maid-servant adrift, expelling\r\nat the same time a man-servant, so that the woman might not be alone\r\nand friendless. The two exiles prospered under the protection of the\r\nserpent, which the woman had rescued from the flames, and became the\r\nfounders of the Pulluvans. According to another story, when the great\r\nGandava forest was in conflagration, the snakes therein were destroyed\r\nin the flames. A large five-hooded snake, scorched and burnt by the\r\nfire, flew away in agony, and alighted at Kuttanad, which is said to\r\nhave been on the site of the modern town of Alleppey. Two women were\r\nat the time on their way to draw water from a well. The snake asked\r\nthem to pour seven potfuls of water over him, to alleviate his pain,\r\nand to turn the pot sideways, so that he could get into it. His\r\nrequest was complied with, and, having entered the pot, he would\r\nnot leave it. He then desired one of the women to take him home, and\r\nplace him in a room on the west side of the house. This she refused\r\nto do for fear of the snake, and she was advised to cover the mouth\r\nof the pot with a cloth. The room, in which the snake was placed,\r\nwas ordered to be closed for a week. The woman's husband, who did not\r\nknow what had occurred, tried to open the door, and only succeeded by\r\nexerting all his strength. On entering the room, to his surprise he\r\nfound an ant-hill, and disturbed it. Thereon the snake issued forth\r\nfrom it, and bit him. As the result of the bite, the man died, and\r\nhis widow was left without means of support. The snake consoled her,\r\nand devised a plan, by which she could maintain herself. She was\r\nto go from house to house, and cry out \"Give me alms, and be saved\r\nfrom snake poisoning.\" The inmates would give, and the snakes, which\r\nwere troubling their houses, would cease from annoying them. For this\r\nreason, a Pulluvan and his wife, when they go with their pulluva kudam\r\n(pot-drum) to a house, are asked to sing, and given money.\r\n\r\nThe Pulluvar females, Mr. T. K. Gopal Panikkar writes, [115] \"take\r\na pretty large pitcher, and close its opening by means of a small\r\ncircular piece of thin leather, which is fastened on to the vessel\r\nby means of strings strongly tied round its neck. Another string is\r\nadjusted to the leather cover, which, when played on by means of the\r\nfingers, produces a hoarse note, which is said to please the gods'\r\nears, pacify their anger, and lull them to sleep.\" In the Malabar\r\nGazetteer, this instrument is thus described. \"It consists of an\r\nearthenware chatty with its bottom removed, and entirely covered,\r\nexcept the mouth, with leather. The portion of the leather which is\r\nstretched over the bottom of the vessel thus forms a sort of drum, to\r\nthe centre of which a string is attached. The other end of the string\r\nis fixed in the cleft of a stick. The performer sits cross-legged,\r\nholding the chatty mouth downwards with his right hand, on his right\r\nknee. The stick is held firmly under the right foot, resting on the\r\nleft leg. The performer strums on the string, which is thus stretched\r\ntight, with a rude plectrum of horn, or other substance. The vibrations\r\ncommunicated by the string to the tympanum produce a curious sonorous\r\nnote, the pitch of which can be varied by increasing or relaxing\r\nthe tension of the string.\" This musical instrument is carried from\r\nhouse to house in the daytime by these Pulluvar females; and, placing\r\nthe vessel in a particular position on the ground, and sitting in\r\na particular fashion in relation to the vessel, they play on the\r\nstring, which then produces a very pleasant musical note. Then they\r\nsing ballads to the accompaniment of these notes. After continuing\r\nthis for some time, they stop, and, getting their customary dues\r\nfrom the family, go their own way. It is believed that the music, and\r\nthe ballads, are peculiarly pleasing to the serpent gods, who bless\r\nthose for whose sakes the music has been rendered.\" The Pulluvans also\r\nplay on a lute with snakes painted on the reptile skin, which is used\r\nin lieu of parchment. The skin, in a specimen at the Madras Museum,\r\nis apparently that of the big lizard Varanus bengalensis. The lute\r\nis played with a bow, to which a metal bell is attached.\r\n\r\nThe dwelling-houses of the Pulluvans are like those of the Izhuvans\r\nor Cherumas. They are generally mud huts, with thatched roof, and a\r\nverandah in front.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl attains maturity, she is placed apart in a room. On the\r\nseventh day, she is anointed by seven young women, who give an offering\r\nto the demons, if she is possessed by any. This consists of the bark\r\nof a plantain tree made into the form of a triangle, on which small\r\nbits of tender cocoanuts and little torches are fixed. This is waved\r\nround the girl's head, and floated away on water. As regards marriage,\r\nthe Pulluvans observe both tali-kettu and sambandham. In the vicinity\r\nof Palghat, members of the caste in the same village intermarry,\r\nand have a prejudice against contracting alliances outside it. Thus,\r\nthe Pulluvans of Palghat do not intermarry with those of Mundur and\r\nKanghat, which are four and ten miles distant. It is said that, in\r\nformer days, intercourse between brother and sister was permitted. But,\r\nwhen questioned on this point, the Pulluvans absolutely deny it. It\r\nis, however, possible that something of the kind was once the case,\r\nfor, when a man belonging to another caste is suspected of incest,\r\nit is said that he is like the Pulluvans. Should the parents of a\r\nmarried woman have no objection to her being divorced, they give her\r\nhusband a piece of cloth called murikotukkuka. This signifies that\r\nthe cloth which he gave is returned, and divorce is effected.\r\n\r\nThe Pulluvans follow the makkathayam law of inheritance (from father\r\nto son). But they seldom have any property to leave, except their hut\r\nand a few earthen pots. They have their caste assemblies (parichas),\r\nwhich adjudicate on adultery, theft, and other offences.\r\n\r\nThey believe firmly in magic and sorcery, and every kind of sickness\r\nis attributed to the influence of some demon. Abortion, death of a\r\nnew-born baby, prolonged labour, or the death of the woman, fever,\r\nwant of milk in the breasts, and other misfortunes, are attributed\r\nto malignant influences. When pregnant women, or even children,\r\nwalk out alone at midday, they are possessed by them, and may fall\r\nin convulsions. Any slight dereliction, or indifference with regard\r\nto the offering of sacrifices, is attended by domestic calamities,\r\nand sacrifices of goats and fowls are requisite. More sacrifices\r\nare promised, if the demons will help them in the achievement of an\r\nobject, or in the destruction of an enemy. In some cases the village\r\nastrologer is consulted, and he, by means of his calculations, divines\r\nthe cause of an illness, and suggests that a particular disease or\r\ncalamity is due to the provocation of the family or other god, to whom\r\nsacrifices or offerings have not been made. Under these circumstances,\r\na Velichapad, or oracle, is consulted. After bathing, and dressing\r\nhimself in a new mundu (cloth), he enters on the scene with a sword\r\nin his hand, and his legs girt with small bells. Standing in front\r\nof the deity in pious meditation, he advances with slow steps and\r\nrolling eyes, and makes a few frantic cuts on his forehead. He is\r\nalready in convulsive shivers, and works himself up to a state of\r\nfrenzied possession, and utters certain disconnected sentences, which\r\nare believed to be the utterances of the gods. Believing them to be the\r\nmeans of cure or relief from calamity, those affected reverentially bow\r\nbefore the Velichapad, and obey his commands. Sometimes they resort to\r\na curious method of calculating beforehand the result of a project,\r\nin which they are engaged, by placing before the god two bouquets of\r\nflowers, one red, the other white, of which a child picks out one with\r\nits eyes closed. Selection of the white bouquet predicts auspicious\r\nresults, of the red the reverse. A man, who wishes to bring a demon\r\nunder his control, must bathe in the early morning for forty-one days,\r\nand cook his own meals. He should have no association with his wife,\r\nand be free from all pollution. Every night, after 10 o'clock, he\r\nshould bathe in a tank (pond) or river, and stand naked up to the loins\r\nin the water, while praying to the god, whom he wishes to propitiate,\r\nin the words \"I offer thee my prayers, so that thou mayst bless me\r\nwith what I want.\" These, with his thoughts concentrated on the deity,\r\nhe should utter 101, 1,001, and 100,001 times during the period. Should\r\nhe do this, in spite of all obstacles and intimidation by the demons,\r\nthe god will grant his desires. It is said to be best for a man to be\r\ntrained and guided by a guru (preceptor), as, if proper precautions\r\nare not adopted, the result of his labours will be that he goes mad.\r\n\r\nA Pulluvan and his wife preside at the ceremony called Pamban Tullal\r\nto propitiate the snake gods of the nagattan kavus, or serpent\r\nshrines. For this, a pandal (booth) is erected by driving four posts\r\ninto the ground, and putting over them a silk or cotton canopy. A\r\nhideous figure of a huge snake is made on the floor with powders of\r\nfive colours. Five colours are essential, as they are visible on\r\nthe necks of snakes. Rice is scattered over the floor. Worship is\r\nperformed to Ganesa, and cocoanuts and rice are offered. Incense is\r\nburnt, and a lamp placed on a plate. The members of the family go\r\nround the booth, and the woman, from whom the devil has to be cast\r\nout, bathes, and takes her seat on the western side, holding a bunch\r\nof palm flowers. The Pulluvan and his wife begin the music, vocal and\r\ninstrumental, the woman keeping time with the pot-drum by striking\r\non a metal vessel. As they sing songs in honour of the snake deity,\r\nthe young female members of the family, who have been purified by a\r\nbath, and are seated, begin to quiver, sway their heads to and fro in\r\ntime with the music, and the tresses of their hair are let loose. In\r\ntheir state of excitement, they beat upon the floor, and rub out the\r\nfigure of the snake with palm flowers. This done, they proceed to\r\nthe snake-grove, and prostrate themselves before the stone images\r\nof snakes, and recover consciousness. They take milk, water from a\r\ntender cocoanut, and plantains. The Pulluvan stops singing, and the\r\nceremony is over. \"Sometimes,\" Mr. Gopal Panikkar writes, \"the gods\r\nappear in the bodies of all these females, and sometimes only in those\r\nof a select few, or none at all. The refusal of the gods to enter into\r\nsuch persons is symbolical of some want of cleanliness in them: which\r\ncontingency is looked upon as a source of anxiety to the individual.\r\n\r\nIt may also suggest the displeasure of these gods towards the family,\r\nin respect of which the ceremony is performed. In either case,\r\nsuch refusal on the part of the gods is an index of their ill-will\r\nor dissatisfaction. In cases where the gods refuse to appear in any\r\none of those seated for the purpose, the ceremony is prolonged until\r\nthe gods are so properly propitiated as to constrain them to manifest\r\nthemselves. Then, after the lapse of the number of days fixed for the\r\nceremony, and, after the will of the serpent gods is duly expressed,\r\nthe ceremonies close.\" Sometimes, it is said, it may be considered\r\nnecessary to rub away the figure as many as 101 times, in which case\r\nthe ceremony is prolonged over several weeks. Each time that the\r\nsnake design is destroyed, one or two men, with torches in their\r\nhands, perform a dance, keeping step to the Pulluvan's music. The\r\nfamily may eventually erect a small platform or shrine in a corner of\r\ntheir grounds, and worship at it annually. The snake deity will not,\r\nit is believed, manifest himself if any of the persons, or articles\r\nrequired for the ceremony, are impure, e.g., if the pot-drum has been\r\npolluted by the touch of a menstruating female. The Pulluvan, from\r\nwhom a drum was purchased for the Madras Museum, was very reluctant\r\nto part with it, lest it should be touched by an impure woman.\r\n\r\nThe Pulluvans worship the gods of the Brahmanical temples, from a\r\ndistance, and believe in spirits of all sorts and conditions. They\r\nworship Velayuthan, Ayyappa, Rahu, Muni, Chathan, Mukkan, Karinkutti,\r\nParakutti, and others. Muni is a well-disposed deity, to whom,\r\nonce a year, rice, plantains, and cocoanuts are offered. To Mukkan,\r\nKarinkutti, and others, sheep and fowls are offered. A floral device\r\n(padmam) is drawn on the floor with nine divisions in rice-flour,\r\non each of which a piece of tender cocoanut leaf, and a lighted wick\r\ndipped in cocoanut oil, are placed. Parched rice, boiled beans, jaggery\r\n(crude sugar), cakes, plantains, and toddy are offered, and camphor\r\nand incense burnt. If a sheep has to be sacrificed, boiled rice is\r\noffered, and water sprinkled over the head of the sheep before it is\r\nkilled. If it shakes itself, so that it frees itself from the water,\r\nit is considered as a favourable omen. On every new-moon day, offerings\r\nof mutton, fowls, rice-balls, toddy, and other things, served up on a\r\nplantain leaf, are made to the souls of the departed. The celebrants,\r\nwho have bathed and cooked their own food on the previous day,\r\nprostrate themselves, and say \"Ye dead ancestors, we offer what we\r\ncan afford. May you take the gifts, and be pleased to protect us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pulluvans bury their dead. The place of burial is near a river,\r\nor in a secluded spot near the dwelling of the deceased. The corpse\r\nis covered with a cloth, and a cocoanut placed with it. Offerings of\r\nrice-balls are made by the son daily for fifteen days, when pollution\r\nceases, and a feast is held.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, some Pulluvans work at various forms of labour,\r\nsuch as sowing, ploughing, reaping, fencing, and cutting timber, for\r\nwhich they are paid in money or kind. They are, in fact, day-labourers,\r\nliving in huts built on the waste land of some landlord, for which they\r\npay a nominal ground-rent. They will take food prepared by Brahmans,\r\nNayars, Kammalans, and Izhuvas, but not that prepared by a Mannan\r\nor Kaniyan. Carpenters and Izhuvas bathe when a Pulluvan has touched\r\nthem. But the Pulluvans are polluted by Cherumas, Pulayas, Paraiyans,\r\nUlladans, and others. The women wear the kacha, like Izhuva women,\r\nfolded twice, and worn round the loins, and are seldom seen with an\r\nupper body-cloth. [116]\r\n\r\nPuluvan.--The Puluvans have been described [117] as \"a small tribe\r\nof cultivators found in the district of Coimbatore. Puluvans are\r\nthe learned men among the Coimbatore Vellalas, and are supposed\r\nto be the depositaries of the poet Kamban's works. One authority\r\nfrom Coimbatore writes that the traditional occupation of this\r\ncaste is military service, and derives the word from bhu, earth,\r\nand valavan, a ruler; while another thinks that the correct word\r\nis Puruvan, aborigines. Their girls are married usually after they\r\nattain maturity. In the disposal of the dead, both cremation and\r\nburial are in vogue, the tendency being towards the former. They\r\nare flesh-eaters. Their customs generally resemble those of the\r\nKonga Vellalas.\"\r\n\r\nThe Puluvans call themselves Puluva Vellalas.\r\n\r\nPunamalli.--The name of a division of Vellalas derived from\r\nPoonamallee, an old military station near Madras.\r\n\r\nPuni.--A sub-division of Golla.\r\n\r\nPunjala (cock, or male).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nPuppalli.--See Unni.\r\n\r\nPuragiri Kshatriya.--A name assumed by some Perikes.\r\n\r\nPuramalai, Puramalainadu or Piramalainadu.--A territorial sub-division\r\nof Kallan.\r\n\r\nPuranadi.--Barbers and priests of the Velans of Travancore, who are\r\nalso called Velakkuruppu.\r\n\r\nPurattu Charna.--A sub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPurusha.--See Jogi Purusha.\r\n\r\nPusa (beads).--A sub-division of Balija. A sub-division of the\r\nYerukalas is known as Pusalavadu, or sellers of glass beads.\r\n\r\nPusali.--A title of Occhans, or pujaris (priests) at temples of Grama\r\nDevatas (village deities).\r\n\r\nPusapati.--The family name of the Maharajahs of Vizianagram. From the\r\nKshatriyas in Rajputana people of four gotrams are said to have come\r\nto the Northern Circars several centuries ago, having the Pusapati\r\nfamily at their head. [118] The name of the present Maharaja is Mirza\r\nRajah Sri Pusapati Viziarama Gajapati Raj Manya Sultan Bahadur Garu.\r\n\r\nPushpakan.--A class of Ambalavasis in Malabar and Travancore. \"As\r\ntheir name (pushpam, a flower) implies, they are employed in bringing\r\nflowers and garlands to the temples.\" [119] See Unni.\r\n\r\nPuthukka Nattar (people of the new country).--A sub-division of\r\nIdaiyan.\r\n\r\nPutiya Islam.--Pu Islam or Putiya Islam is the name returned mostly\r\nby Mukkuvans, in reference to their new conversion to the Muhammadan\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nPutta (ant-hill).--An exogamous sept of Kamma, Kuruba, Mala, Medara,\r\nand Padma Sale. 'White-ant' (Termites) hills are frequently worshipped\r\nas being the abode of snakes.\r\n\r\nPuttiya.--A sub-division of Rona.\r\n\r\nPuttur.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as a\r\nsub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nPuzhi Tacchan (sand carpenter).--The name of a small section of\r\nMalabar Kammalans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n\r\nRacha (= Raja).--Racha or Rachu, signifying regal, occurs as the\r\ntitle of various Telugu classes, for example, Balija, Golla, Kapu,\r\nKonda Dora, Koya, Majjulu, and Velama. Some Perikes, who claim to be\r\nKshatriyas, call themselves Racha Perikes. Racha is further given as\r\nan abbreviated form of Mutracha.\r\n\r\nRachevar.--It is noted, in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, that \"there\r\nare three broad distinctions founded on the traditional occupation,\r\nbut there are two main exclusive divisions of Telugu and Kannada\r\nRachevars. One set, called Ranagare, are military, and most of them\r\nare found employed in His Highness the Maharaja's Rachevar and Bale\r\nforces. The second, consisting of the Chitragaras or Bannagaras, make\r\ngood paintings, decorations, and lacquered ware and toys. The last\r\nconsists of the Sarige, or gold lace makers. These people claim to\r\nbe Kshatriyas--a pretension not generally acquiesced in by the other\r\ncastes. They trace their origin to a passage in Brahmanda Purana,\r\nwherein it is said that, for an injury done to a Brahman, they were\r\ncondemned to follow mechanical occupations.\" In connection with recent\r\nDasara festivities at Mysore, I read that there were wrestling matches,\r\nacrobatic feats, dumb-bell and figure exercises by Rachevars.\r\n\r\nIn the Tanjore Manual it is noted that the Rachevars are \"descendants\r\nof immigrants from the Telugu country, who apparently followed the\r\nNayak viceroys of the Vijayanagar empire in the sixteenth century. They\r\nare more or less jealous of the purity of their caste. Their language\r\nis Telugu. They wear the sacred thread.\"\r\n\r\nIn the city of Madras, and in other places in Tamil country, the\r\nRachevars are called Razus or Mucchis, who must not be confused with\r\nthe Mucchis of Mysore and the Ceded districts, who are shoe-makers,\r\nand speak Marathi. In the Telugu country, there are two distinct\r\nsections of Rachevars, viz., Saivite and Vaishnavite. The Saivite\r\nRachevars in the Kistna district style themselves Arya Kshatriyalu,\r\nbut they are commonly called Nakash-vandlu, which is a Hindustani\r\nsynonym of Chitrakara or Jinigiri-vandlu. The Vaishnavites are known\r\nas Jinigiri-vandlu, and are said not to intermarry with the Saivites.\r\n\r\nRafizi.--A term, meaning a forsaker, used by Sunni Muhammadans for\r\nany sect of Shiahs. The name appears, in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1901, as Rabjee.\r\n\r\nRagala (ragi: Eleusine Coracana).--An exogamous sept of Chembadi,\r\nKorava and Madiga. The equivalent Ragithannaya occurs as an exogamous\r\nsept of Bant. Ragi grain constitutes the staple diet of the poorer\r\nclasses, who cannot afford rice, and of prisoners in jails, for\r\nwhom it is ground into flour, and boiled into a pudding about the\r\nconsistency of blanc-mange. The name is derived from raga, red,\r\nin reference to the red colour of the grain.\r\n\r\nRaghindala (pipal: Ficus religiosa).--A gotra of Gollas, the members\r\nof which are not allowed to use the leaves of this tree as food-plates.\r\n\r\nRajakan.--A Sanskrit equivalent of Vannan (washerman).\r\n\r\nRajamahendram.--The name, in reference to the town of Rajahmundry in\r\nthe Godavari district, of a sub-division of Balija.\r\n\r\nRajamakan.--A Tamil synonym for the Telugu Razu.\r\n\r\nRajavasal.--The name, denoting those who are servants of Rajas,\r\nof a sub-division of Agamudaiyans, which has been transformed\r\ninto Rajavamsu, meaning those of kingly parentage. The equivalent\r\nRajavamsam is recorded, in the Census Report, 1901, as being returned\r\nby some Maravans in Madura and Kurumbans in Trichinopoly. Rajakulam,\r\nRajabasha, or Rajaboga occurs as a sub-division of Agamudaiyan.\r\n\r\nRajpinde.--See Arasu.\r\n\r\nRajpuri.--The Rajpuris, or Rajapuris, are a Konkani-speaking\r\ncaste of traders and cultivators in South Canara. Concerning them,\r\nMr. H. A. Stuart writes as follows. [120] \"The Rajapuris, also called\r\nBalolikars, were originally traders, and perhaps have some claim\r\nto be considered Vaisyas. In social status they admit themselves to\r\nbe inferior only to Brahmans. They wear the sacred thread, profess\r\nthe Saiva faith, and employ Karadi Brahmans as priests in all their\r\nceremonies. Their girls should be married before the age of puberty,\r\nand marriage of widows is not permitted. The marriage ceremony\r\nchiefly consists in the hands of the bride and bridegroom being united\r\ntogether, and held by the bride's father while her mother pours water\r\nover them. The water should first fall on the bride's hands, and then\r\nflow on to those of the bridegroom. This takes place at the bride's\r\nhouse. A curious feature in the ceremony is that for four days either\r\nthe bride or bridegroom should occupy the marriage bed; it must never\r\nbe allowed to become vacant. [This ceremony is called pajamadmai, or\r\nmat marriage.] On the fourth day, the couple go to the bridegroom's\r\nhouse, where a similar 'sitting' on the marriage bed takes place. They\r\nare mostly vegetarians, rice being their chief food, but some use fish,\r\nand rear fowls and goats for sale as food. Many are now cultivators.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that, among the Shivalli Brahmans, the mat is taken\r\nto a tank in procession. The bride and bridegroom make a pretence of\r\ncatching fish, and, with linked hands, touch their foreheads.\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Census Report, 1891, Rajapuri Konkanasta is given as\r\na synonym of the Rajapuris, who are said to be one of the sixty-six\r\nclasses of Konkanasta people, who inhabited the sixty-six villages of\r\nthe Konkan. In the Census Report, 1901, Kudaldeshkara and Kudlukara\r\nare returned as sub-divisions of Rajapuri. The Kudlukaras are\r\nKonkani-speaking confectioners, who follow the Brahmanical customs.\r\n\r\nRajput.--The Rajputs (Sanskrit, raja-putra, son of a king) have\r\nbeen defined [121] as \"the warrior and land-owning race of Northern\r\nIndia, who are also known as Thakur, lord, or Chhatri, the modern\r\nrepresentative of the ancient Kshatriya.\" At the Madras census,\r\n1891 and 1901, the number of individuals, who returned themselves as\r\nRajputs, was 13,754 and 15,273. \"It needs,\" Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,\r\n[122] \"but a cursory examination of the sub-divisions returned under\r\nthe head Rajput to show that many of these individuals have no claim\r\nwhatever to the title of Rajput. The number of pure Rajputs in this\r\nPresidency must be very small indeed, and I only mention the caste\r\nin order to explain that the number of persons returning it is far\r\nin excess of the actual number of Rajputs.\" Mr. Stuart writes further\r\n[123] concerning the Rajputs of the North Arcot district that \"there\r\nare but few of this caste in the district, and they chiefly reside in\r\nVellore; a few families are also found in Chittoor and Tirupati. They\r\nassert that they are true Kshatriyas who came from Rajputana with\r\nthe Muhammadan armies, and they, more than any other claimants to\r\na Kshatriya descent, have maintained their fondness for military\r\nservice. Almost all are sepoys or military pensioners. Their names\r\nalways end with Singh, and in many of their customs they resemble the\r\nMuhammadans, speaking Hindustani, and invariably keeping their wives\r\ngosha. They are often erroneously spoken of by the people as Bondilis,\r\na term which is applicable only to the Vaisya and Sudra immigrants\r\nfrom Northern India; but doubtless many of these lower classes have\r\ntaken the title Singh, and called themselves Rajputs. Members of\r\nthe caste are, therefore, very suspicious of strangers professing\r\nto be Rajputs. Their cooking apartment, called chowka, is kept most\r\nreligiously private, and a line is drawn round it, beyond which none\r\nbut members of the family itself may pass. At marriages and feasts,\r\nfor the same reason, cooked food is never offered to the guests,\r\nbut raw grain is distributed, which each cooks in a separate and\r\nprivate place.\"\r\n\r\nIt is noted, [124] in connection with the battle of Padmanabham\r\nin the Vizagapatam district, in 1794, that \"no correct list of the\r\nwounded was ever procured, but no less than three hundred and nine\r\nwere killed. Of these two hundred and eight were Rajputs, and the\r\nbodies of forty Rajputs, of the first rank in the country, formed a\r\nrampart round the corpse of Viziarama Razu. Padmanabham will long be\r\nremembered as the Flodden of the Rajputs of Vizianagram.\"\r\n\r\nRakshasa (a mythological giant).--An exogamous sept of Toreya.\r\n\r\nRalla (precious stones).--A sub-division of Balijas who cut, polish,\r\nand trade in precious stones. A further sub-division into Mutiala\r\n(pearl) and Kempulu (rubies) is said to exist.\r\n\r\nRamadosa (Cucumis Melo: sweet melon).--A sept of Viramushti.\r\n\r\nRama Kshatri.--A synonym of Servegara.\r\n\r\nRamanuja.--Satanis style themselves people of the Ramanuja Matham\r\n(religious sect) in reference to Ramanuja, the Tamil Brahman, who\r\nfounded the form of Vaishnavism which prevails in Southern India.\r\n\r\nRanaratod.--An exogamous sept of the Kuruvikkarans, who call themselves\r\nRatodi.\r\n\r\nRanaviran.--A name, meaning a brave warrior, returned by some\r\nChakkiliyans.\r\n\r\nRandam Parisha (second party).--A section of Elayad.\r\n\r\nRangari.--The Rangaris are summed up, in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1891, as being \"a caste of dyers and tailors found in almost all the\r\nTelugu districts. They are of Maratha origin, and still speak that\r\nlanguage. They worship the goddess Ambabhavani. The dead are either\r\nburned or buried. Their title is Rao.\"\r\n\r\nIn an account of the Rangaris of the North Arcot district,\r\nMr. H. A. Stuart writes that \"Rangari is a caste of dyers, chiefly\r\nfound in Walajapet. They claim to be Kshatriyas, who accompanied\r\nRama in his conquest of Ceylon, from which fact one of their names,\r\nLangari (lanka, the island, i.e., Ceylon), is said to be derived. Rama,\r\nfor some reason or other, became incensed against, and persecuted\r\nthem. Most were destroyed, but a respectable Kshatriya lady saved\r\nher two sons by taking off their sacred threads and causing one\r\nto pretend that he was a tailor sewing, and the other that he\r\nwas a dyer, colouring his thread with the red betel nut and leaf,\r\nwhich she hurriedly supplied out of her mouth. The boys became the\r\nprogenitors of the caste, the members of which now wear the thread. The\r\ndescendants of the one brother are tailors, and of the other, the\r\nmost numerous, dyers. Their chief feasts are the Dassara and Kaman,\r\nthe former celebrated in honour of the goddess Tuljabhavani and the\r\nlatter of Manmada, the Indian Cupid, fabled to have been destroyed\r\nby the flame of Siva's third eye. During the Kaman feast, fires of\r\ncombustible materials are lighted, round which the votaries gather,\r\nand, beating their mouths, exclaim 'laba, laba', lamenting the death of\r\nCupid. In this feast Rajputs, Mahrattas, Bondilis, and Guzeratis also\r\njoin. The Rangaris speak Marathi, which they write in the northern\r\ncharacter, and name Poona and Sholapur as the places in which they\r\noriginally resided. In appearance they do not at all resemble the\r\nother claimants to Kshatriya descent, the Razus and Rajputs, for they\r\nare poorly developed and by no means handsome. Widow remarriage is\r\npermitted where children have not been born, but remarried widows are\r\nprohibited from taking part in religious processions, which seems a\r\nsign that the concession has been reluctantly permitted. In most of\r\ntheir customs they differ but little from the Razus, eating meat and\r\ndrinking spirits, but not keeping their women gosha.\"\r\n\r\nAll the Rangaris examined by me at Adoni in the Bellary district were\r\ntailors. Like other Maratha classes they had a high cephalic index\r\n(av. 79; max. 92), and it was noticeable that the breadth of the head\r\nexceeded 15 cm. in nine out of thirty individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Census Report, 1901, Bahusagara, Malla or Mulla, and\r\nNamdev are given as synonyms, and Chimpiga (tailor) and Unupulavadu\r\n(dyer) as sub-castes of Rangari.\r\n\r\nRaniyava.--The Raniyavas are Canarese-speaking Holeyas, who are found\r\nnear Kap, Karkal, Mudibidri, and Mulki in South Canara. They consider\r\nthemselves to be superior to the Tulu-speaking Holeyas, such as the\r\nMari and Mundala Holeyas.\r\n\r\nThe Raniyavas regard Virabadra Swami as their tribal deity, and also\r\nworship Mari, to whom they sacrifice a buffalo periodically. The bhuta\r\n(devil), which is most commonly worshipped, is Varthe. They profess\r\nto be Saivites, because they are the disciples of the Lingayat priest\r\nat Gurupur.\r\n\r\nMarriage is, as a rule, infant, though the marriage of adult girls is\r\nnot prohibited. The marriage rites are celebrated beneath a pandal\r\n(booth) supported by twelve pillars. As among the Tulu castes, the\r\nchief item in the marriage ceremony is the pouring of water over the\r\nunited hands of the bridal couple, who are not, like the Canarese\r\nHoleyas in Mysore, separated by a screen.\r\n\r\nWomen who are found guilty of adultery, or of illicit intercourse\r\nbefore marriage, are not allowed to wear bangles, nose-screw, or\r\nblack bead necklaces, and are treated like widows. Men who have been\r\nproved guilty of seduction are not allowed to take part in the caste\r\ncouncil meetings.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the first menstrual period, a girl is under\r\npollution for twelve days. Eleven girls pour water over her head\r\ndaily. On the thirteenth day, the castemen are fed, and, if the girl\r\nis married, consummation takes place.\r\n\r\nMarried men and women are cremated, and unmarried persons buried. On\r\nthe day of death, toddy must be given to those who assemble. Cooked\r\nmeat and food are offered to the deceased on the third, seventh, and\r\nthirteenth days, and, on the seventh day, toddy must be freely given.\r\n\r\nRao.--The title of Desastha Brahmans, and various Maratha classes,\r\nJains, and Servegaras. Some Perikes, who claim Kshatriya origin,\r\nhave also assumed Rao (=Raya, king) instead of the more humble Anna\r\nor Ayya as a title.\r\n\r\nRarakkar.--The Rarakkars or Vicharakkars are exorcisers for the\r\nKuravans of Travancore.\r\n\r\nRati (stone).--A sub-division of Odde.\r\n\r\nRatna (precious stones).--An exogamous sept of Kuruba. The equivalent\r\nRatnala is a synonym of Ralla Balijas, who deal in precious stones.\r\n\r\nRattu.--A sub-division of Kaikolan.\r\n\r\nRavari.--Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as a trading\r\nsection of the Nayars. The word is said to be a corruption of Vyapari,\r\nmeaning trader. The equivalent Raveri occurs as a class inhabiting\r\nthe Laccadive islands.\r\n\r\nRavi Chettu (pipal tree: Ficus religiosa).--An exogamous sept of\r\nKalingi. The pipal or aswatha tree may be seen, in many South Indian\r\nvillages, with a raised platform round it, before which Hindus remove\r\ntheir shoes, and bow down. On the platform, village council meetings\r\nare often held. It is believed that male offspring will be given to\r\nchildless couples, if they celebrate a marriage of the pipal with\r\nthe nim tree (Melia Azadirachta).\r\n\r\nRavulo.--It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that\r\n\"there are three castes of temple servants among the Oriyas, the\r\nRavulos, the Malis and the Munis. The Ravulos blow conches (shells of\r\nTurbinella rapa) in the Saivite temples and at Brahmans' weddings, sell\r\nflowers, and regard themselves as superior to the other two. The Malis\r\ndo service in Saivite or Vaishnavite temples and sell flowers, but the\r\nMunis are employed only in the temples of the village goddesses. Among\r\nthe Ravulos, infant marriage is compulsory, but widow marriage is\r\nallowed, and also divorce in certain cases. A curious account is\r\ngiven of the punishment sometimes inflicted by the caste panchayat\r\n(council) on a man who ill-treats and deserts his wife. He is made to\r\nsit under one of the bamboo coops with which fish are caught, and his\r\nwife sits on the top of it. Five pots of water are then poured over\r\nthe pair of them in imitation of the caste custom of pouring five pots\r\nof water over a dead body before it is taken to the burning-ground,\r\nthe ceremony taking place in the part of the house where a corpse\r\nwould be washed. The wife then throws away a ladle, and breaks a\r\ncooking-pot just as she would have done had her husband really been\r\ndead, and further breaks her bangles and tears off her necklace,\r\njust as would have been done if she was really a widow. Having thus\r\nsignified that her husband is dead to her, she goes straight off to\r\nher parents' house, and is free to marry again. Some Ravulos wear\r\nthe sacred thread. They employ Brahmans as priests for religious and\r\nceremonial purposes. They eat fish and meat, though not beef or fowls,\r\nbut do not drink alcohol. Nowadays many of them are earth-workers,\r\ncart-drivers, bricklayers, carpenters and day labourers.\" It is\r\nfurther noted, in the Census Report, that Mali is \"an Oriya caste of\r\nvegetable growers and sellers, and cultivators. Also a caste belonging\r\nto Bengal and Orissa, the people of which are garland makers and\r\ntemple servants. The statistics confuse the two.\" In an account of\r\nthe Ravulos, as given to me, Ravulos, Munis, and Malis are not three\r\ncastes, but one caste. The Munis are said to worship, among others,\r\nMunis or Rishis, Sakti, Siva, and Ganesa. A Muni, named Sarala Doss,\r\nwas the author of the most popular Oriya version of the Mahabharata,\r\nand he is known as Sudra Muni, the Sudra saint.\r\n\r\nRavulo occurs further as a title of Kurumos who officiate as priests\r\nin Siva temples in Ganjam, and Muni as a title of the Sipiti temple\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nRavutan.--Ravutan, or Rowthan, is a title used by Labbai, Marakkayar,\r\nand Jonagan Muhammadans. The equivalent Ravut or Raut has been recorded\r\nas a sub-caste of Balija, and a title of Kannadiyan.\r\n\r\nRaya Rauturu.--The name of certain chunam [lime] burners in Mysore.\r\n\r\nRayan.--A title assumed by some Pallis or Vanniyans, who wear the\r\nsacred thread, and claim to be Kshatriyas.\r\n\r\nRayi (stone).--An exogamous sept of Mala.\r\n\r\nRazu.--The Razus, or Rajus, are stated, in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1901, to be \"perhaps descendants of the military section of the Kapu,\r\nKamma, and Velama castes. At their weddings they worship a sword,\r\nwhich is a ceremony which usually denotes a soldier caste. They say\r\nthey are Kshatriyas, and at marriages use a string made of cotton and\r\nwool, the combination peculiar to Kshatriyas, to tie the wrist of the\r\nhappy couple. But they eat fowls, which a strict Kshatriya would not\r\ndo, and their claims are not universally admitted by other Hindus. They\r\nhave three endogamous sub-divisions, viz., Murikinati, Nandimandalam,\r\nand Suryavamsam, of which the first two are territorial.\" According to\r\nanother version, the sub-divisions are Surya (sun), Chandra (moon),\r\nand Nandimandalam. In a note on the Razus of the Godavari district,\r\nthe Rev. J. Cain sub-divides them into Suryavamsapu, Chandravamsapu,\r\nVeliveyabadina, or descendants of excommunicated Suryavamsapu and\r\nRazulu. It may be noted that some Konda Doras call themselves Raja\r\n(= Razu) Kapus or Reddis, and Suryavamsam (of the solar race). \"In\r\nthe Godavari delta,\" Mr. Cain writes, \"there are several families\r\ncalled Basava Razulu, in consequence, it is said, of their ancestors\r\nhaving accidentally killed a basava or sacred bull. As a penalty for\r\nthis crime, before a marriage takes place in these families, they are\r\nbound to select a young bull and young cow, and cause these two to\r\nbe duly married first, and then they are at liberty to proceed with\r\ntheir own ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Razus, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes [125] that \"this is a Telugu\r\ncaste, though represented by small bodies in some of the Tamil\r\ndistricts. They are most numerous in Cuddapah and North Arcot,\r\nto which districts they came with the Vijayanagar armies. It is\r\nevident that Razu has been returned by a number of individuals who,\r\nin reality, belong to other castes, but claim to be Kshatriyas. The\r\ntrue Razus also make this claim, but it is, of course, baseless,\r\nunless Kshatriya is taken to mean the military class without any\r\nreference to Aryan origin. In religion they are mostly Vaishnavites,\r\nand their priests are Brahmans. They wear the sacred thread, and in\r\nmost respects copy the marriage and other customs of the Brahmans.\" The\r\nRazus, Mr. Stuart writes further, [126] are \"the most numerous class\r\nof those who claim to be Kshatriyas in North Arcot. They are found\r\nalmost entirely in the Karvetnagar estate, the zemindar being the head\r\nof the caste. As a class they are the handsomest and best developed\r\nmen in the country, and differ so much in feature and build from other\r\nHindus that they may usually be distinguished at a glance. They seem to\r\nhave entirely abandoned the military inclinations of their ancestors,\r\nnever enlist in the native army, and almost wholly occupy themselves in\r\nagriculture. Their vernacular is Telugu, since they are immigrants from\r\nthe Northern Circars, from whence most of them followed the ancestors\r\nof the Karvetnagar zamindar within the last two centuries. In religion\r\nthey are mostly Vaishnavites, though a few follow Siva, and the worship\r\nof village deities forms a part of the belief of all. Their peculiar\r\ngoddess is called Nimishamba who would seem to represent Parvati. She\r\nis so called because in an instant (nimisham) she once appeared at\r\nthe prayer of certain rishis, and destroyed some rakshasas or giants\r\nwho were persecuting them. Claiming to be Kshatriyas, the Razus of\r\ncourse assume the sacred thread, and are very proud and particular\r\nin their conduct, though flesh-eating is allowed. In all the more\r\nwell-to-do families the females are kept in strict seclusion.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Vizagapatam district Razus are recognised as belonging to\r\ntwo classes, called Konda (hill) and Bhu (plains) Razu. The former\r\nare further divided into the following sections, to which various\r\nzamindars belong:--Konda, Kodu, Gaita, Muka, Yenati. The Konda Razus\r\nare believed to be hill chiefs, who have, in comparatively recent\r\ntimes, adopted the title of Razu.\r\n\r\nFor the following note on the Razus of the Godavari district, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. F. R. Hemingway. \"They say they are Kshatriyas,\r\nwear the sacred thread, have Brahmanical gotras, decline to eat\r\nwith other non-Brahmans, and are divided into the three classes,\r\nSurya (sun), Chandra (moon), and Machi (fish). Of these, the first\r\nclaim to be descended from the kings of Oudh, and to be of the same\r\nlineage as Rama; the second, from the kings of Hastinapura, of the\r\nsame line as the Pandavas; and the third, from Hanuman (the monkey\r\ngod) and a mermaid. Their women observe a very strict rule of gosha,\r\nand this is said to be carried so far that a man may not see his\r\nyounger brother's wife, even if she is living in the same house,\r\nwithout violating the gosha rule. The betrothal ceremony is called\r\nnirnaya bhojanam, or meal of settlement. Written contracts of marriage\r\n(subha reka) are exchanged. The wedding is performed at the bride's\r\nhouse. At the pradanam ceremony, no bonthu (turmeric thread) is tied\r\nround the bride's neck. The bridegroom has to wear a sword throughout\r\nthe marriage ceremonies, and he is paraded round the village with it\r\nbefore they begin. The gosha rule prevents his womenfolk from attending\r\nthe marriage, and the bride has to wear a veil. The ceremonies, unlike\r\nthose of other castes, are attended with burnt offerings of rice,\r\netc. Among other castes, the turmeric-dyed thread (kankanam), which is\r\ntied round the wrists of the contracting couple, is of cotton; among\r\nthe Razus it is of wool and cotton. The Razus are chiefly employed\r\nin cultivation. Some of them are said to attain no small proficiency\r\nin Telugu and Sanskrit scholarship. Zamindars of this caste regard\r\nKali as their patron deity. The Razus of Amalapuram specially adore\r\nLakshmi. Some peculiarities in their personal appearance may be\r\nnoted. Their turbans are made to bunch out at the left side above\r\nthe ear, and one end hangs down behind. They do not shave any part of\r\ntheir heads, and allow long locks to hang down in front of the ears.\"\r\n\r\nA colony of Razus is settled at, and around Rajapalaiyam in the\r\nTinnevelly district. They are said to have migrated thither four or\r\nfive centuries ago with a younger brother of the King of Vizianagram,\r\nwho belonged to the Pusapati exogamous sept. To members of this and the\r\nGottimukkula sept special respect is paid on ceremonial occasions. The\r\ndescendants of the original emigrants are said to have served under\r\nsouthern chieftains, especially Tirumala Naick. Concerning the origin\r\nof the village Rajapalaiyam the following legend is narrated. One\r\nChinna Raju, a lineal descendant of the Kings of Vizianagram, settled\r\nthere with others of his caste, and went out hunting with a pack of\r\nhounds. When they reached the neighbouring hill Sanjiviparvatham,\r\nthey felt thirsty, but could find no water. They accordingly prayed\r\nto Krishna, who at once created a spring on the top of the hill. After\r\nquenching their thirst thereat, they proceeded westward to the valley,\r\nand the god informed them that there was water there, with which they\r\nmight again quench their thirst, and that their dogs would there be\r\nattacked by hares. At this spot, which they were to consider sacred\r\nground, they were to settle down. The present tank to the westward of\r\nRajapalaiyam, and the chavadi (caste meeting-place) belonging to the\r\nPusapatis are said to indicate the spot where they originally settled.\r\n\r\nThe Rajapalaiyam Razus have four gotras, named after Rishis, i.e.,\r\nDhananjaya, Kasyapa, Kaundinya and Vasishta, which are each sub-divided\r\ninto a number of exogamous septs, named after villages, etc. They are\r\nall Vadagalai or Tengalai Vaishnavites, but also worship Ayanar, and\r\nsend kavadi (portable canopy) to Palni in performance of vows. Their\r\nfamily priests are Brahmans.\r\n\r\nThe betrothal ceremony of the Razus of Rajapalaiyam is generally\r\ncarried out at the house of the girl. On a raised platform within\r\na pandal (booth), seven plates filled with plantain fruits, betel,\r\nturmeric, cocoanuts, and flowers are placed. A plate containing\r\ntwenty-five rupees, and a ravike (female cloth), is carried by a\r\nBrahman woman, and set in front of the girl. All the articles are\r\nthen placed in her lap, and the ceremony is consequently called odi\r\nor madi ninchadam (lap-filling).\r\n\r\nThe girl's hair is decked with flowers, and she is smeared with\r\nsandal and turmeric. A certain quantity of paddy (unhusked rice) and\r\nbeans of Phaseolus Mungo are given to the Brahman woman, a portion of\r\nwhich is set apart as sacred, some of the paddy being added to that\r\nwhich is stored in the granary. The remainder of the paddy is husked\r\nin a corner of the pandal, and the beans are ground in a mill. On\r\nthe marriage morning, the bride's party, accompanied by musicians,\r\ncarry to the house of the bridegroom a number of baskets containing\r\ncocoanuts, plantains, betel, and a turban. The bridegroom goes with\r\na purohit (priest), and men and women of his caste, to a well, close\r\nto which are placed some milk and the nose-screw of a woman closely\r\nrelated to him. All the women sprinkle some of the milk over his head,\r\nand some of them draw water from the well. The bridegroom bathes,\r\nand dresses up. Just before their departure from the well, rice\r\nwhich has been dipped therein is distributed among the women. At the\r\nbridegroom's house the milk-post, usually made from a branch of the\r\nvekkali (Anogeissus latifolia) tree, is tied to a pillar supporting\r\nthe roof of the marriage dais. To the top of the milk-post a cross-bar\r\nis fixed, to one arm of which a cloth bundle containing a cocoanut,\r\nbetel and turmeric, is tied. The post is surmounted by leafy mango\r\ntwigs. Just before the milk-post is set up, cocoanuts are offered to\r\nit, and a pearl and piece of coral are placed in a hole scooped out\r\nat its lower end. The bundle becomes the perquisite of the carpenter\r\nwho has made the post. Only Brahmans, Razus and the barber musicians\r\nare allowed to sit on the dais. After the distribution of betel, the\r\nbridegroom and his party proceed to the house of the bride, where, in\r\nlike manner, the milk-post is set up. They then return to his house,\r\nand the bridegroom has his face and head shaved, and nails pared by\r\na barber, who receives as his fee two annas and the clothes which\r\nthe bridegroom is wearing. After a bath, the bridegroom is conducted\r\nto the chavadi, where a gaudy turban is put on his head, and he is\r\ndecorated with jewels and garlands. In the course of the morning,\r\nthe purohit, holding the right little finger of the bridegroom,\r\nconducts him to the dais, close to which rice, rice stained yellow,\r\nrice husk, jaggery (crude sugar), wheat bran, and cotton seed are\r\nplaced. The Brahmanical rites of punyahavaachanam (purification),\r\njatakarma (birth ceremony), namakaranam (name ceremony), chaulam\r\n(tonsure), and upanayanam (thread ceremony) are performed. But, instead\r\nof Vedic chants, the purohit recites slokas specially prepared for\r\nnon-Brahman castes. At the conclusion of these rites, the bridegroom\r\ngoes into the house, and eats a small portion of sweet cakes and\r\nother articles, of which the remainder is finished off by boys and\r\ngirls. This ceremony is called pubanthi. The Kasiyatra (mock flight\r\nto Benares) or Snathakavritham is then performed. Towards evening\r\nthe bridegroom, seated in a palanquin, goes to the bride's house,\r\ntaking with him a tray containing an expensive woman's cloth, the\r\ntali tied to gold thread, and a pair of gold bracelets. When they\r\nreach the house, the women who have accompanied the bridegroom throw\r\npaddy over those who have collected at the entrance thereto, by whom\r\nthe compliment is returned. The bridegroom takes his seat on the dais,\r\nand the bride is conducted thither by her brothers. A wide-meshed green\r\ncurtain is thrown over her shoulders, and her hands are pressed over\r\nher eyes, and held there by one of her brothers, so that she cannot\r\nsee. Generally two brothers sit by her side, and, when one is tired,\r\nthe other relieves him. The purohit invests the bridegroom with a\r\nsecond thread as a sign of marriage. Damp rice is scattered from a\r\nbasket all round the contracting couple, and the tali, after it has\r\nbeen blessed by Brahmans, is tied round the neck of the bride by the\r\nbridegroom and her brothers. At the moment when the tali is tied,\r\nthe bride's hands are removed from her face, and she is permitted\r\nto see her husband. The pair then go round the dais, and the bride\r\nplaces her right foot thrice on a grindstone. Their little fingers\r\nare linked, and their cloths tied together. Thus united, they are\r\nconducted to a room, in which fifty pots, painted white and with\r\nvarious designs on them, are arranged in rows. In front of them,\r\ntwo pots, filled with water, are placed, and, in front of the two\r\npots, seven lamps. Round the necks of these pots, bits of turmeric\r\nare tied. They are called avareti kundalu or avireni kundalu, and are\r\nmade to represent minor deities. The pots are worshipped by the bridal\r\ncouple, and betel is distributed among the Brahmans and Razus, of whom\r\nmembers of the Pusapati and Gottimukkala septs take precedence over the\r\nothers. On the following day, the purohit teaches the sandyavandhanam\r\n(morning and evening ablutions), which is, however, quite different\r\nfrom the Brahmanical rite. On the morning of the third or nagavali\r\nday, a quantity of castor-oil seed is sent by the bride's people to\r\nthe bridegroom's house, and returned. The bride and bridegroom go,\r\nin a closed and open palanquin, respectively, to the house of the\r\nformer. They take their seats on the dais, and the bride is once\r\nmore blindfolded. In front of them, five pots filled with water\r\nare arranged in the form of a quincunx. Lighted lamps are placed by\r\nthe side of each of the corner pots. On the lids of the pots five\r\ncocoanuts, plantains, pieces of turmeric, and betel are arranged, and\r\nyellow thread is wound seven times round the corner pots. The pots\r\nare then worshipped, and the bridegroom places on the neck of the\r\nbride a black bead necklace, which is tied by the Brahman woman. In\r\nfront of the bridegroom some salt, and in front of the bride some\r\npaddy is heaped up. An altercation arises between the bridegroom and\r\nthe brother of the bride as to the relative values of the two heaps,\r\nand it is finally decided that they are of equal value. The bridal\r\npair then enter the room, in which the avireni pots are kept, and\r\nthrow their rings into one of the pots which is full of water. The\r\nbridegroom has to pick out therefrom, at three dips, his own ring,\r\nand his brother-in-law that of the bride. The purohit sprinkles water\r\nover the heads of the pair, and their wrist-threads (kankanam) are\r\nremoved. They then sit in a swing on the pandal for a short time,\r\nand the ceremonies conclude with the customary waving of coloured\r\nwater (arati) and distribution of betel. During the marriage ceremony,\r\nRazu women are not allowed to sit in the pandal. The wives of the more\r\nwell-to-do members of the community remain gosha within their houses,\r\nand, strictly speaking, a woman should not see her husband during the\r\ndaytime. Many of the women, however, go freely about the town during\r\nthe day, and go to the wells to fetch water for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Razus of Rajapalaiyam have Razu as the agnomen, and, like other\r\nTelugu classes, take the gotra for the first name, e.g., Yaraguntala\r\nMudduswami Razu, Gottimukkala Krishna Razu. The women adhere with\r\ntenacity to the old forms of Telugu jewelry. The Razus, in some\r\nvillages, seem to object to the construction of a pial in front of\r\ntheir houses. The pial, or raised platform, is the lounging place\r\nby day, where visitors are received. The Razus, as has been already\r\nstated, claim to be Kshatriyas, so other castes should not sit in their\r\npresence. If pials were constructed, such people might sit thereon,\r\nand so commit a breach of etiquette.\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Census Report, 1901, Rajamakan is given as a Tamil\r\nsynonym for Razu, and Razu is returned as a title of the Bagata\r\nfishermen of Vizagapatam. Razu is, further, a general name of the\r\nBhatrazus.\r\n\r\nReddi.--See Kapu.\r\n\r\nReddi Bhumi (Reddi earth).--A sub-division of Mala, Mangala, and\r\nTsakala.\r\n\r\nRela (fig. Ficus, sp.).--A gotra of Medara.\r\n\r\nRelli.--See Haddi.\r\n\r\nRendeddu.--A sub-division of Ganigas or Gandlas, who use two bullocks\r\nfor their oil-pressing mill.\r\n\r\nRokkam (ready money).--An exogamous sept of Komati.\r\n\r\nRolan.--Rolan, or Roli Cheruman, is a sub-division of Cheruman.\r\n\r\nRona.--The Ronas are a class of Oriya-speaking hill cultivators, who\r\nare said [127] to \"hold a position superior in the social scale to the\r\nParjas (Porojas), from whom, by compulsion and cajolery, they have\r\ngotten unto themselves estates. They are not of very long standing\r\n(in Jeypore). Every Parja village head is still able to point out\r\nthe fields that have been taken from him to form the Rona hamlet;\r\nand, if he is in antagonism with a neighbouring Parja village on the\r\nsubject of boundaries, he will include the fields occupied by the Rona\r\nas belonging de jure to his demesne.\" In the Madras Census Report,\r\n1891, it is noted that \"the Ronas are supposed to be the descendants\r\nof Ranjit, the great warrior of Orissa. In social status they are\r\nsaid to be a little inferior to the so-called Kshatriyas. Some of\r\nthem serve as armed retainers and soldiers of the native chiefs,\r\nand some are engaged in trade and cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nFor the following note I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The word\r\nrona means battle. According to a tradition current among the Ronas,\r\ntheir ancestors, who were seven brothers, came many generations ago\r\nto Nundapur, the former capital of the Rajas of Jeypore, and made\r\ntheir first settlement in Borra.\r\n\r\nThe caste is divided into four endogamous divisions, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Rona Paiko.\r\n(2) Odiya Paiko, said to rank a little higher than the preceding.\r\n(3) Kottiya Paiko, the descendants of Rona Paikos and women of\r\n    hill tribes.\r\n(4) Pattiya Paik, the descendants of Kottiya Paikos and women of\r\n    hill tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs examples of septs among the Ronas, the following may be cited:--Kora\r\n(sun), Bhag (tiger), Nag (cobra), Khinbudi (bear), and Matsya (fish).\r\n\r\nWhen a girl reaches puberty, she is placed apart in a portion of\r\nthe house where she cannot be seen by males, even of the household,\r\nand sits in a space enclosed by seven arrows connected together by\r\na thread. On the seventh day she bathes, and is presented with a\r\nnew cloth. It is customary for a man to marry his paternal uncle's\r\ndaughter. At the time of marriage, the bridegroom's party repair to\r\nthe house of the bride with a sheep, goat, rice, and a female cloth\r\nwith a rupee placed on it, and four quarter-anna bits inserted within\r\nits fold. The cloth and money are taken by the bride's mother, and\r\nthe animals and rice are used for a feast. On the following day, the\r\nbride goes to the house of the bridegroom, in front of which a pandal\r\n(booth), made out of nine poles of the neredu tree (Eugenia Jambolana)\r\nhas been set up. At the auspicious hour, which has been fixed by the\r\nDesari who officiates, in the absence of a Brahman, at the marriage\r\nrites, the bride and bridegroom take their seats in the pandal with a\r\ncurtain between them. The Desari joins their hands together, and ties\r\nto the ends of their cloths a new cloth to which a quarter-anna piece\r\nis attached, betel leaves and nuts, and seven grains of rice. The\r\ncurtain is then removed, and the pair enter the house. The knotted\r\nnew cloth is removed, and kept in the house during the next two days,\r\nbeing untied and re-tied every morning. On the third day, the couple\r\nagain come within the pandal, and the new cloth is again tied to\r\nthem. They are bathed together in turmeric water, and the cloth is\r\nthen untied for the last time. The rice is examined to see if it\r\nis in a good state of preservation, and its condition is regarded\r\nas an omen for good or evil. The remarriage of widows is permitted,\r\nand a younger brother usually marries the widow of his elder brother.\r\n\r\nThere is for all the Ronas a headman of their caste, called Bhatho\r\nNayako, at Nundapur, who decides offences, such as eating in the house\r\nof a man of inferior caste, and performs the ceremonial cleansing of\r\na man who has been beaten with a shoe. Divorce and civil suits are\r\nsettled by a caste council.\r\n\r\nThe Ronas worship the deity Takurani. They wear the sacred thread,\r\nand are said to have bought the right to do so from a former Raja\r\nof Jeypore. They also wear a necklace of tulsi (Ocimum sanctum)\r\nbeads. The necklace is first tied on by Oriya Brahmans from Orissa,\r\nor Vaishnava Brahmans from Srikurmam in Ganjam, who pay periodic visits\r\nto the community, and receive presents of money and food. Rona Paikos\r\nwill eat at the hands of Brahmans only, whereas Puttiya Paikos will\r\neat in the houses of Koronos, Malis, Kummaras, and Gaudos. All eat\r\nanimal food, beef and pork excepted.\r\n\r\nSome Ronas are still the armed retainers of the Jeypore Rajas, and\r\ntheir forefathers were versed in the use of the matchlock. Some Ronas\r\nat the present day use bows and arrows. The caste title is Nayako.\r\n\r\nRonguni.--The Rongunis are Oriya dyers and weavers. The caste name is\r\nderived from rangu, dye. A noticeable fact is that they do not eat\r\nflesh of any kind, but are vegetarians, pure and simple. They have\r\nvarious titles, e.g., Behara, Daso, Prushti, and Sahu, of which some\r\npractically constitute exogamous septs.\r\n\r\nRottala (bread).--An exogamous sept of Boya.\r\n\r\nRowthan.--See Ravutan.\r\n\r\nRudra.--One of the various names of Siva. A sub-division of Palli.\r\n\r\nRudrakshala (the drupe of Elæocarpus Ganitrus).--An exogamous sept of\r\nKarna Sales. The drupes are polished, and worn as a rosary or necklet\r\nby Saivite Brahmans, Pandarams, Nattukottai Chettis, and others. They\r\nare supposed to be the tears of ecstasy which Siva (Rudra) once shed,\r\nand are consequently sacred to him. They have a number of lobes\r\n(or faces), varying from one to six, divided externally by deep\r\nfurrows. Those with five lobes are the most common, but those with\r\none (eka mukha) or six (shan mukha) are very rare, and have been\r\nknown to be sold for a thousand rupees. One form of the drupe is\r\ncalled Gauri shanka, and is worn in a golden receptacle by Dikshitar\r\nBrahmans at Chidambaram, and by some Pandarams who are managers\r\nof matams (religious institutions). The plate represents a Telugu\r\nSaivite Vaidiki Brahman clad in a coat of rudraksha beads, wearing\r\na head-dress of the same, and holding in his hand wooden castanets,\r\nwhich are played as an accompaniment to his songs. Until he became too\r\nold to bear the weight, he wore also a loin-cloth made of these beads.\r\n\r\nRunzu.--Runzu, Runza, or Runja is the name of a class of Telugu\r\nmendicants, who beat a drum called runjalu, and beg only from Kamsalas\r\n(q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS\r\n\r\n\r\nSachchari.--A synonym of Relli. Another form of the word Chachchadi.\r\n\r\nSadaru.--A sub-division of Lingayats, found mainly in the\r\nBellary and Anantapur districts, where they are largely engaged in\r\ncultivation. Some Bedars or Boyas, who live amidst these Lingayats,\r\ncall themselves Sadaru. It is noted in the Mysore Census Reports that\r\nthe Sadas are \"cultivators and traders in grain. A section of these\r\nSadas has embraced Lingayatism, while the others are still within\r\nthe pale of Hinduism.\"\r\n\r\nSaddikudu (cold rice or food).--An exogamous sept of Golla.\r\n\r\nSadhana Surulu.--Sadhanasura is recorded, in the Madras Census\r\nReport, 1901, as a synonym of Samayamuvadu. In a note on this class\r\nof itinerant mendicants, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao states that, unlike\r\nthe Samayamuvaru, they are attached only to the Padma Sale section\r\nof the Sale caste. \"They say,\" he writes, \"that their name is an\r\nabbreviated form of Renuka Sakthini Sadhinchinavaru, i.e., those who\r\nconquered Renuka Sakthi. According to tradition, Renuka was the mother\r\nof Parasurama, one of the avatars of Vishnu, and is identified with\r\nthe goddess Yellamma, whom the Padma Sales revere. The Sadhana Surulu\r\nare her votaries. Ages ago, it is said, they prayed to her on behalf\r\nof the Padma Sales, and made her grant boons to them. Since that\r\ntime they have been treated with marked respect by the Padma Sales,\r\nwho pay them annually four annas, and see to their marriages.\"\r\n\r\nSadhu (meek or quiet).--A sub-division or exogamous sept of Ganiga\r\nand Padma Sale. The equivalent Sadhumatam has been recorded, at\r\ntimes of census, by Janappans. The name Sadhu is applied to ascetics\r\nor Bairagis.\r\n\r\nSagarakula.--A synonym of the Upparas, who claim descent from a king\r\nSagara Chakravarthi of the Mahabharata.\r\n\r\nSahavasi.--The Sahavasis are described, in the Mysore Census Report,\r\n1891, as \"immigrants like the Chitpavanas. Sahavasi means co-tenant or\r\nassociate, and the name is said to have been earned by the community\r\nin the following manner. In remote times a certain Brahman came upon\r\nhidden treasure, but, to his amazement, the contents appeared in\r\nhis eye to be all live scorpions. Out of curiosity, he hung one of\r\nthem outside his house. A little while after, a woman of inferior\r\ncaste, who was passing by the house, noticed it to be gold, and,\r\nupon her questioning him about it, the Brahman espoused her, and by\r\nher means was able to enjoy the treasure. He gave a feast in honour\r\nof his acquisition of wealth. He was subsequently outcasted for his\r\nmésalliance with the low caste female, while those that ate with him\r\nwere put under a ban, and thus acquired the nickname.\"\r\n\r\nSahu.--A title of Bolasis, Godiyas, and other Oriya castes.\r\n\r\nSaindla (belonging to the death-house).--A sub-division of Mala.\r\n\r\nSajjana (good men).--A synonym of Lingayat Ganigas.\r\n\r\nSajje (millet: Setaria italica).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nSakala.--See Tsakala.\r\n\r\nSakkereya.--Some Upparas style themselves Mel (western)\r\nSakkereya-varu. Their explanation is that they used to work in salt,\r\nwhich is more essential than sugar, and that Mel Sakkare means\r\nsuperior sugar.\r\n\r\nSakuna Pakshi.--For the following note on the Sakuna Pakshi\r\n(prophetic bird) mendicant caste of Vizagapatam, I am indebted to\r\nMr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The name of the caste is due to the fact that\r\nthe members of the caste wear on their heads a plume composed of\r\nthe feathers of a bird called palagumma, which is probably Coracias\r\nindica, the Indian roller, or \"blue jay\" of Europeans. This is one of\r\nthe birds called sakuna pakshi, because they are supposed to possess\r\nthe power of foretelling events, and on their movements many omens\r\ndepend. Concerning the roller, Jerdon writes [128] that \"it is sacred\r\nto Siva, who assumed its form, and, at the feast of the Dasserah at\r\nNagpore, one or more used to be liberated by the Rajah, amidst the\r\nfiring of cannon and musketry, at a grand parade attended by all the\r\nofficers of the station. Buchanan Hamilton also states that, before\r\nthe Durga Puja, the Hindus of Calcutta purchase one of these birds,\r\nand, at the time when they throw the image of Durga into the river,\r\nset it at liberty. It is considered propitious to see it on this day,\r\nand those who cannot afford to buy one discharge their matchlocks to\r\nput it on the wing.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to their own account, the Sakuna Pakshis are Telagas who\r\nemigrated to Vizagapatam from Peddapuram in the Godavari district.\r\n\r\nA member of the caste, before proceeding on a begging expedition,\r\nrises early, and has a cold meal. He then puts the Tengalai Vaishnava\r\nnamam mark on his forehead, slings on his left shoulder a deer-skin\r\npouch for the reception of the rice and other grain which will be\r\ngiven him as alms, and takes up his little drum (gilaka or damaraka)\r\nmade of frog's skin. It is essential for a successful day's begging\r\nthat he should first visit a Mala house or two, after which he begs\r\nfrom other castes, going from house to house.\r\n\r\nThe members combine with begging the professions of devil-dancer,\r\nsorcerer, and quack doctor. Their remedy for scorpion sting\r\nis well-known. It is the root of a plant called thella visari\r\n(scorpion antidote), which the Sakuna Pakshis carry about with\r\nthem on their rounds. The root should be collected on a new-moon\r\nday which falls on a Sunday. On that day, the Sakuna Pakshi bathes,\r\ncuts off his loin-string, and goes stark naked to a selected spot,\r\nwhere he gathers the roots. If a supply thereof is required, and the\r\nnecessary combination of moon and day is not forthcoming, the roots\r\nshould be collected on a Sunday or Wednesday.\r\n\r\nSalangukaran.--In the Madras Census Report, 1901, Salangaikaran is\r\nreturned as a synonym of Karaiyan or Sembadavan fishermen. The word\r\nsalangu or slangu is used for pearl fisheries, and Salangukaran is,\r\nI imagine, a name applied to pearl divers.\r\n\r\nSalapu.--The Salapus are a small caste of Telugu weavers in\r\nVizagapatam, for the following note on whom I am indebted to\r\nMr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The name Salapu seems to be a corruption\r\nof Saluppan, a caste which formerly engaged in the manufacture\r\nof gunny-bags and coarse cloths. The Salapus at the present day\r\nmake such cloths, commonly called gamanchalu. Like some other\r\nweaving castes, they claim descent from Markandeya rishi, who was\r\nremarkable for his austerities and great age, and is also known as\r\nDirghayus. The Salapus will not eat, or intermarry with Sales. The\r\ncaste is governed by a headman called Senapati. He decides disputes,\r\nand, on occasions of marriage, receives the first share of betel and\r\nsandal, and is the first to touch the sathamanam (marriage badge)\r\nwhen it is passed round to be blessed by those assembled. He is,\r\nat marriages, further presented with a rupee. At caste feasts, it is\r\nhis privilege to partake of food first.\r\n\r\nLike other Telugu castes, the Salapus have intiperulu, or exogamous\r\nsepts. Girls are generally married before puberty. The custom of\r\nmenarikam, by which a man should marry his maternal uncle's daughter,\r\nis in force. The turmeric ceremony takes place some months before\r\nmarriage. Some male and female relations of the future bridegroom\r\nrepair to the house of the girl, taking with them a few rupees as the\r\nbride-price (voli). The girl bathes, and daubs herself with turmeric\r\npaste. A solid silver bangle is then put on her right wrist. The\r\nremarriage of widows and divorce are permitted.\r\n\r\nThe Salapus are divided into Lingavantas and Vaishnavas, who\r\nintermarry. The former bury their dead in a sitting posture, and the\r\nlatter practice cremation. Jangams officiate for the Lingavantas,\r\nand Satanis for Vaishnavas. Both sections observe the chinna (little)\r\nand pedda rozu (big day) death ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe caste title is generally Ayya.\r\n\r\nSalapu.--A form of Sarapu, an occupational term for those who deal\r\nin coins, jewelry, coral, etc.\r\n\r\nSale.--The Sales are the great weaver class among the Telugus, for\r\nthe following note on whom I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.\r\n\r\nThe name is derived from Sanskrit, Salika, a weaver. The Sales call\r\nthemselves Senapati (commander-in-chief), and this is further the\r\ntitle of the caste headman. They are divided into two main endogamous\r\nsections, Padma or lotus, and Pattu or silk. Between them there are\r\nthree well-marked points of difference, viz., (1) the Pattu Sales wear\r\nthe sacred thread, whereas the Padma Sales do not; (2) the Pattu Sales\r\ndo not take food or water at the hands of any except Brahmans, whereas\r\nthe Padma Sales will eat in Kapu, Golla, Telaga, Gavara, etc., houses;\r\n(3) the Pattu Sales weave superfine cloths, and, in some places, work\r\nin silk, whereas Padma Sales weave only coarse cloths. Each section\r\nis divided into a number of exogamous septs or intiperulu. Both speak\r\nTelugu, and are divided into Vaishnavites and Saivites. These religious\r\ndistinctions are no bar to intermarriage and interdining.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district (1907),\r\nthat \"on the plains, cotton cloths are woven in hundreds of villages\r\nby Sales, Padma Sales, Pattu Sales, Devangas, and Salapus. The ryots\r\noften spin their own cotton into thread, and then hand it over to the\r\nweavers to be made into cloths, but large quantities of machine-made\r\nyarn are used. In the south, the chief weaving centres are Nakkapalli\r\nand Payakaraopeta in Sarvasiddhi taluk, the Pattu Sales in the latter\r\nof which turn out fabrics of fine thread, enriched with much gold and\r\nsilver 'lace,' which are in great demand in the Godavari and Ganjam\r\ndistricts. At Razam, coloured cloths for women are the chief product,\r\nand in the country round this place the white garments so universal\r\neverywhere give place to coloured dress. The cloths are sold locally,\r\nand also sent in large quantities to Berhampur, Cuttack, and even\r\nCalcutta. Most of the weaving is in the hands of Devangas, but the\r\ndyeing of the thread is done with imported aniline and alizarine\r\ncolours by the Balijas of Sigadam in Chipurupalle taluk and Balijapeta\r\nin Bobbili. In Siripuram and Ponduru, the Pattu Sales make delicate\r\nfabrics from especially fine thread, called Pattu Sale nulu, or\r\nsilk-weaver's thread, which the women of their caste spin for them, and\r\nwhich is as fine as imported 1508. These are much valued by well-to-do\r\nnatives for their softness and durability. The weaving industry is\r\non the decline throughout the district, except perhaps in Razam,\r\nand the weaver castes are taking to other means of livelihood. Round\r\nChipurupalle, for example, the Pattu Sales have become experts in\r\ntobacco-curing, and have made such profits that they are able to\r\nmonopolise much of the trade and money-lending of the locality.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the origin of the Sale caste, it is stated, in the\r\nAndhrapada Parijatamu, that it is the result of an union between\r\na Kamsala man and a potter woman. According to a current legend,\r\nthe celestials (devatas), being desirous of securing clothing\r\nfor themselves and their dependents, asked Markandeya Rishi to\r\nsupply them with it. He went to Vishnu, and prayed to him. The god\r\ndirected him to make a sacrificial offering to Indra, the celestial\r\nking. Markandeya accordingly performed a great sacrifice, and from the\r\nfire issued Bhavana Rishi, with a ball of thread in his hands, which\r\nhe had manufactured, under Vishnu's direction, from the fibre of the\r\nlotus which sprang from the god's navel. With this ball of thread he\r\nproceeded to make cloths for the celestials. He subsequently married\r\nBhadravathi, the daughter of Surya (the sun), who bore him a hundred\r\nand one sons, of whom a hundred became the ancestors of the Padma\r\nSales, while the remaining man was the ancestor of the Pattu Sales.\r\n\r\nThe caste worships Bhavana Rishi. At the close of the year, the caste\r\noccupation is stopped before the Sankramanam for ten days. Before\r\nthey start work again, the Pattu Sales meet at an appointed spot,\r\nwhere they burn camphor, and wave it before a ball of thread, which\r\nrepresents Bhavana Rishi. A more elaborate rite is performed by\r\nthe Padma Sales. They set apart a special day for the worship of\r\nthe deified ancestor, and hold a caste feast. A special booth is\r\nerected, in which a ball of thread is placed. A caste-man acts as\r\npujari (priest), and fruits, flowers, camphor, etc., are offered to\r\nthe thread.\r\n\r\nThe Telugu Padma Sales, and Marathi-speaking Sukun and Suka Sales,\r\nare, as will be seen from the following table, short of stature,\r\nwith high cephalic index:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Stature. cm.   Cephalic index.\r\n\r\n              Padma Sale          159.9              78.7\r\n              Suka Sale           161.1              81.8\r\n              Sukun Sale          160.3              82.2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Padma and Karna Sales are dealt with in special articles.\r\n\r\nWriting in the eighteenth century, Sonnerat remarks that the weaver\r\nfixes his loom under a tree before his house in the morning, and at\r\nnight takes it home. And this observation holds good at the present\r\nday. Weaving operations, as they may be seen going on at weaving\r\ncentres in many parts of Southern India, are thus described by\r\nMr. H. A. Stuart. [129] \"The process of weaving is very simple. The\r\nthread is first turned off upon a hand-spindle, and then the warp\r\nis formed. Bamboo sticks, 120 in number, are fixed upright in the\r\nground, generally in the shade of a tope or grove, at a distance\r\nof a cubit from one another, and ten women or children, carrying\r\nratnams (spindles) in their hands, walk up and down this line,\r\none behind the other, intertwining the thread between the bamboos,\r\nuntil 1,920 threads of various colours, according to the pattern\r\ndesired, are thus arranged. For this work each gets half an anna--a\r\nsmall remuneration for walking four miles. To form a warp sufficient\r\nfor eight women's cloths, forty miles have thus to be traversed. In\r\nweaving silk cloths or the finer fabrics, the length of the warp is\r\nless than sixty yards. As soon as the threads have been arranged,\r\nthe bamboos are plucked up, and rolled together with the threads\r\nupon them. Trestles are then set out in the tope, and upon them\r\nthe warp with the bamboos is stretched horizontally, and sized by\r\nmeans of large long brushes with ragi starch, and carried along by\r\ntwo men. This having dried, the whole is rolled up, and placed in\r\nthe loom in the weaver's house. The weaving room is a long, narrow,\r\ndark chamber, lighted by one small window close to where the workman\r\nsits. The loom is constructed on the simplest principles, and can be\r\ntaken to pieces in a few minutes, forming a light load for a man. The\r\nalternate threads of the warp are raised and depressed, to receive\r\nthe woof in the following manner. Two pairs of bamboos are joined\r\ntogether by thin twine loops, and, being suspended from the roof, are\r\nalso joined to two pedals near the floor. Through the joining loops\r\nof one pair of bamboos run half the threads, and through those of\r\nthe other run the other half. Thus, by depressing one pedal with the\r\nfoot and raising the other, one set of threads is depressed, and the\r\nother raised so as to admit of the woof thread being shot across. This\r\nthread is forced home by a light beam suspended from the roof, and\r\nthen, the position of the pedals being reversed, the woof thread is\r\nshot back again between the reversed threads of the warp. In this way\r\nabout three yards can be woven in a day.\" Further Mr. J. D. Rees writes\r\nas follows. [130] \"As you enter a weaver's grove, it appears at first\r\nsight as if those occupied in this industry were engaged in a pretty\r\ngame. Rows of women walk up and down the shady aisles, each holding\r\naloft in the left hand a spindle, and in the right a bamboo wand,\r\nthrough a hook at the end of which the thread is passed. Alongside\r\nare split bamboos reaching as high as their hips, and, as they pass,\r\nthey unwind the thread from the spindle by means of the wand, and\r\npass it over each alternate upright. The threads, thus separated,\r\nare subsequently lifted with their bamboo uprights from the ground,\r\nand, while extended from tree to tree in a horizontal position, are\r\nwashed with rice-water, and carefully brushed. The threads are now\r\nready to be made into cloth, and the actual weaving is carried on by\r\nmeans of primitive hand looms inside the houses.\"\r\n\r\nWeavers, like many other classes in Southern India, are eminently\r\nconservative. Even so trifling an innovation as the introduction\r\nof a new arrangement for maintaining tension in the warp during the\r\nprocess of weaving gave rise a short time ago to a temporary strike\r\namong the hand-loom weavers at the Madras School of Arts.\r\n\r\nFor the following note on the weaving industry, I am indebted to\r\nMr. A. Chatterton. \"The hand-weavers may be divided into two great\r\nclasses--(1) plain weavers, who weave cloths or fabrics with a single\r\nshuttle, which carries the weft from selvage to selvage; (2) bordered\r\ncloth weavers, who weave cloths in which the threads of the weft of the\r\nportion of the fabric forming the borders are distinct from the threads\r\nof the weft of the main body of the cloth. To manufacture these cloths,\r\nthree shuttles are employed, and as yet no successful attempt has been\r\nmade to imitate them on the power loom. The bordered cloth weavers do\r\nnot suffer from the direct competition of machine-made piece-goods,\r\nand the depression in their branch of the industry is due to changes\r\nin the tastes of the people. [131] In the manufacture of a cloth\r\nfrom the raw material there are three distinct processes: spinning,\r\nwarping, and weaving. Modern machinery has absolutely and completely\r\nousted hand-spinning; the primitive native methods of warping have\r\nbeen to a large extent replaced by improved hand-machines, and power\r\nlooms have displaced hand looms to some extent; but there is still an\r\nenormous hand-loom industry, some branches of which are in by no means\r\nan unsatisfactory condition. In our efforts to place the hand-weaving\r\nindustry on a better footing, we are endeavouring to improve the\r\nprimitive methods of indigenous weavers both in regard to warping and\r\nweaving. In respect to weaving we have met with considerable success,\r\nas we have demonstrated that the output of the fly-shuttle loom is\r\nfully double that of the native hand loom, and it is in consequence\r\nslowly making its way in the weaving centres of Southern India. In\r\nrespect to warping, no definite solution has yet been effected, and\r\nwe are still experimenting. The problem is complicated by the fact\r\nthat the output of a warping mill must necessarily be sufficient to\r\nkeep at least a hundred hand looms at work, and at the present time\r\nthe hand-weaving industry is not organised on any basis, which gives\r\npromise of development into co-operative working on so large a scale as\r\nwould give employment to this number of looms. In Madura, Coimbatore,\r\nMadras and Salem, attempts are being made to establish organised\r\nhand-loom weaving factories, and these represent the direction in which\r\nfuture development must take place. At present all these factories\r\nare running with fly-shuttle looms, and various modifications of\r\nthe old types of hand-warping machinery. The only experiments in\r\nwarping and sizing are now being conducted, at Government expense,\r\nin the Government weaving factory at Salem, and in a small factory\r\nestablished privately at Tondiarpet (Madras). A warping machinery,\r\nsuited to Indian requirements, has been specially designed for us in\r\nEngland, and there is no doubt but that it will provide a solution\r\nto the warping question, but whether it will be satisfactory or not\r\ndepends upon the efficiency of hank sizing. The superiority of native\r\ncloths is commonly attributed to the fact that they are made in hand\r\nlooms, but in reality it is largely due to the methods of sizing\r\nemployed by native weavers, and it is still doubtful whether we can\r\nattain the same results by any process which involves the production\r\nof continuous warps of indefinite length. The ordinary native warp\r\nis short, and it is stretched out to its full length in the street,\r\nand the size carefully and thoroughly brushed into it. The warps\r\nwhich our machines will produce may be thousands of yards in length,\r\nand, if they are successful, will almost entirely do away with the\r\nenormous waste of time involved in putting new warps into a loom at\r\nfrequent intervals. That they will be successful in a sense there is no\r\nreasonable doubt, but whether the goods produced in our hand-weaving\r\nfactories will be what are now known as hand-woven goods, or whether\r\nthey will partake more of the nature of the power-loom productions,\r\nremains to be seen. With the cheap labour available in Southern India,\r\nthere is probably a future for hand-weaving factories, but it will\r\ndepend almost entirely upon the successful training of the weavers, and\r\nexperience shows that they are not easily amenable to discipline, and\r\nhave very rigid objections to anything approaching a factory system.\"\r\n\r\nIn a speech delivered at Salem in 1906, Sir Arthur Lawley, Governor\r\nof Madras, spoke as follows. \"I know something of the prosperity of\r\nthe weaving industry in days gone by, and I regret exceedingly to\r\nlearn that it is not in so flourishing a condition as at one time\r\nit well claimed to be. Now, we have all of us heard a good deal of\r\nSwadeshi, and the Government is being constantly urged, from time to\r\ntime, to do something to foster the industries of this country. We\r\nmade a beginning here by setting up a Weaving Institute. We believed\r\nthat by doing so we should put within the knowledge of the weavers\r\nof this district methods whereby their output of cloth would be\r\ngreater, while the cost was reduced, and that thus their material\r\nprosperity would be considerably advanced. Now it is somewhat of a\r\nsurprise, and considerable disappointment to me to learn that this\r\neffort which we have made is regarded with suspicion, if not with\r\nhostility. I am afraid our motives have been misunderstood, because\r\nI need hardly assure you that the idea that the Government should\r\nenter into competition with any of the industries of the country never\r\nsuggested itself to us. We desired simply and solely to infuse some\r\nfresh spirit into an industry which was languishing.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note on the weaving industry, Mr. E. B. Havell writes thus. [132]\r\n\"The principle of the Danish co-operative system as applied to\r\ndairy-farming is the combination of a number of small proprietors for\r\nsending their products to a central factory, in which each of them\r\nhas a share proportionate to the quantity of his contributions. In\r\nthe management of the factory, each member has an absolutely equal\r\nvoice, irrespective of his holdings. Adapting such a system to the\r\nIndian weaving industry, each weaving community would have a central\r\nestablishment under its own control, which would arrange the purchase\r\nof material at wholesale rates, prepare warps for the weavers' looms,\r\nand organise the sale of the finished products. The actual weaving\r\nwould be carried on as at present in the weavers' houses by the\r\nmaster weavers and their apprentices. If a system of this kind would\r\nretain the economic advantages of the factory system, and eliminate\r\nits many evils, it is obvious that a factory, owned and controlled\r\nby the weavers themselves, and worked only for their advantage, is\r\na very different thing to a factory controlled by capitalists only\r\nfor the purpose of exploiting the labour of their employees.\"\r\n\r\nAs bearing on the general condition of the weaving community,\r\nthe following extract from the Report of the Famine in the Madras\r\nPresidency, 1896-97, may be quoted. \"Among the people who felt the\r\ndistress at the beginning were the weavers. It is a well-known fact\r\nthat the people of the weaver castes, as well as Mussalman weavers,\r\nare generally improvident, and consequently poor. In favourable times,\r\nthe weavers generally earn fair wages. They, however, spend all they\r\nearn without caring to lay by anything, so that very few of their\r\ncaste are in well-to-do circumstances. The same is the case with the\r\nMussalman weavers. All these weavers are entirely in the hands of the\r\nsowcars (money-lenders), who make advances to them, and get cloths in\r\nreturn. The cloths thus obtained by the sowcars are exported to other\r\nparts of the country. It may be taken as a general fact that most of\r\nthe professional weavers are indebted to the sowcars, and are bound to\r\nweave for them. So long as the seasons are favourable, and sowcars get\r\nindents for cloths from their customers, they continue their advances\r\nto their dependent weavers. But when, owing to any cause, the demand\r\ndecreases, the sowcars curtail their advances proportionately, and\r\nthe weavers are at once put to difficulty. According to the fineness\r\nand kind of fabrics turned out by the weavers, they may be divided\r\ninto fine cloth weavers and silk weavers, and weavers of coarse\r\ncloths. It is the coarse cloth weavers that would be affected with\r\nthe first appearance of distress. The consumers of their manufactures\r\nare the poorer classes, and, with the appearance of scarcity and high\r\nprices, the demand for the coarser kinds of cloths would cease. Such\r\nwas actually the case at the beginning of the recent distress. The\r\nweavers are, as a class, not accustomed to hard manual labour, nor\r\nare they able to work exposed to heat and sun. If such people are put\r\non earth-work, they would certainly fail to turn out the prescribed\r\ntask, and consequently earn insufficient wages. They would thus be,\r\nas it were, punished for no fault of theirs. This state of things\r\nwould last at least for some time, until the weavers got accustomed\r\nto earth-work. Again, these people have, by constant work at their\r\nown craft, attained to a certain degree of skill and delicacy, and,\r\nif compelled to do earth-work during the temporary unfavourable\r\nseason, they would certainly lose, to some extent, their skill and\r\ndelicacy of hand, and would become unfit, in that degree, for their\r\naccustomed work when favourable season returns. They would thus be put\r\nto inconvenience doubly. During the first part of the distress, their\r\nskill of hand, and delicacy of constitution would stand in their way,\r\nand, after the return of good season, the loss of manual skill and\r\ndelicacy would place them at a disadvantage. It can be easily seen\r\nthat giving relief to the weavers in their own calling is the most\r\neconomical form of relief. In this form of special relief, Government\r\nadvances materials to the weavers to be woven into different kinds of\r\ncloths. Government has no doubt to incur a large initial expenditure\r\nin the shape of value of materials, and wages for weavers for making\r\nthese materials into cloths. But all the materials are returned woven\r\ninto cloths, so that, at the close of the operations, Government has\r\na stock of cloths, which can be disposed of without difficulty on the\r\nreturn of favourable times, and the cost incurred recovered. In this\r\nway, Government not only administers relief to a pretty large section\r\nof its poor subjects, but keeps up, with little or no cost to itself,\r\nthe industrial skill of this section of the people.\"\r\n\r\nOf proverbs relating to the weaver, one runs to the effect that, \"if\r\nyou want to narrow the breadth of a river, you should plant reeds on\r\nits margin; and, if you desire to destroy the sanitation of a village,\r\nyou should bring weavers to it, and settle them there.\" When the dyes\r\nhave to be fixed, and the dyed twist has to be washed, the weavers\r\ngenerally resort to running water, and pollute it. The several\r\nprocesses of twisting and untwisting threads, preparing skeins,\r\netc., make combined labour a necessity in the weaving industry;\r\nand, wherever one finds a weaver settlement, he must find there a\r\nlarge number of these people, as is explained by the proverb that\r\n\"the Chetti (merchant) lost by partnership, while the weaver came\r\nto grief by isolation.\" When plying shuttles in the weaving process,\r\nthe weavers always use their feet in shifting the warp, by treading\r\non a press. Thus, if a weaver unfortunately happens to have a sore\r\non his foot, it means loss to him; or, as the proverb says, \"If a\r\ndog gets a sore on its head, it never recovers from it; and even so\r\na weaver who gets a sore on his foot.\" [133]\r\n\r\nSalige (wire).--A gotra of Kurni.\r\n\r\nSaliyan.--The Saliyan weavers of Kornad and Ayyampet, in the Tanjore\r\ndistrict, are a Tamil-speaking class, who must not be confused with\r\nthe Telugu Sales. They afford an interesting example of how a limited\r\nnumber of families, following the same occupation, can crystallise\r\ninto a separate caste. They claim to have a Puranam relating to\r\ntheir origin, which is said to be found in the Sthalapuranam of the\r\nNalladai temple. They believe that they are the descendants of one\r\nSaliya Maha Rishi, a low-caste man, who did service for one Visakar,\r\nwho was doing penance near Nalladai. Through the grace of the rishi\r\nVisakar, Saliya became a rishi, and married two wives. The Saliyans\r\nare said to be descended from the offspring of the first wife, and\r\nthe Mottai Saliyans from the offspring of the second.\r\n\r\nThe Saliyans have taken to wearing the sacred thread, engage\r\nBrahman purohits, and are guided by Brahman priests. They are said\r\nto have had their own caste priests until a Brahman from Sendangudi,\r\nnear Mayavaram, accepted the office of priest. It is reported that,\r\nin former days, the Saliyans were not allowed to sell their goods\r\nexcept in a fixed spot called mamaraththumedu, where they set out\r\ntheir cloths on bamboos. High-caste people never touched the cloths,\r\nexcept with a stick. At the present day the Saliyans occupy a good\r\nposition in the social scale, and employ Brahman cooks, though no\r\nother castes will eat in their houses.\r\n\r\nA curious feature in connection with the Saliyans is that, contrary to\r\nthe usual rule among Tamil castes, they have exogamous septs or vidu\r\n(house), of which the following are examples:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mandhi, black monkey.\r\n    Kottangkachchi, cocoanut shell.\r\n    Thuniyan, cloth.\r\n    Kachchandhi, gunny-bag.\r\n    Vellai parangi, white vegetable marrow.\r\n    Ettadiyan, eight feet.\r\n    Thadiyan, stout.\r\n    Kazhudhai, donkey.\r\n    Thavalai, frog.\r\n    Sappaikalan, crooked-legged.\r\n    Malaiyan, hill.\r\n    Kaththan, an attendant on Aiyanar.\r\n    Ozhakkan, a measure.\r\n    Thondhi, belly.\r\n    Munginazhi, bamboo measure.\r\n    Odakkazhinjan, one who defæcated when running.\r\n    Kamban, the Tamil poet.\r\n    Ottuvidu, tiled house.\r\n    Kalli, Euphorbia Tirucalli.\r\n    Sirandhan, a noble person.\r\n    Thambiran, master or lord.\r\n    Kollai, backyard.\r\n    Madividu, storeyed house.\r\n    Murugan, name of a person.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Saliyans have further acquired gotras named after rishis, and,\r\nwhen questioned as to their gotra, refer to the Brahman purohits.\r\n\r\nThe Saliyan weavers of silk Kornad women's cloths, who have settled at\r\nMayavaram in the Tanjore district, neither intermarry nor interdine\r\nwith the Saliyans of the Tinnevelly district, though they belong\r\nto the same linguistic division. The Tinnevelly Saliyans closely\r\nfollow the Kaikolans in their various ceremonials, and in their\r\nsocial organisation, and interdine with them. Saliya women wear three\r\narmlets on the upper arm, whereas Kaikola women only wear a single\r\narmlet. The Saliyans may not marry a second wife during the lifetime\r\nof the first wife, even if she does not bear children. They may,\r\nhowever, adopt children. Some of the Tinnevelly Saliyans have taken\r\nto trade and agriculture, while others weave coarse cotton cloths,\r\nand dye cotton yarn.\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1901, Ataviyar is recorded as \"a synonym for,\r\nor rather title of the Tinnevelly Sales.\" Further, Pattariyar\r\nis described as a Tamil corruption of Pattu Saliyan, returned\r\nby some of the Tinnevelly Sales. The Adaviyar or Pattalia Settis\r\nare Tamilians, probably an offshoot of the Kaikolans, and have no\r\nconnection with the Telugu Pattu Sales, who, like the Padma Sales,\r\nretain their mother-tongue wherever they settle. It is recorded [134]\r\nin connection with the Saliyar of the Chingleput district, many of\r\nwhom are Kaikolans, that \"a story is current of their persecution\r\nby one Salva Naik (said to have been a Brahman). The result of this\r\nwas that large bodies of them were forced to flee from Conjeeveram\r\nto Madura, Tanjore, and Tinnevelly, where their representatives are\r\nstill to be found.\"\r\n\r\nThe Adaviyars follow the Tamil Puranic type of marriage ceremonies,\r\nand have a sirutali (small tali) as a marriage badge. The caste deity\r\nis Mukthakshiamman. The dead are always cremated.\r\n\r\nSaluppan.--The Tamil equivalent of the Telugu Janappan, which is\r\nderived from janapa, the sunn hemp (Crotolaria juncea).\r\n\r\nSamagara.--The Samagaras have been described [135] as \"the principal\r\nclass of leather-workers in the South Canara district. They are\r\ndivided into two endogamous groups, the Canarese Samagaras and the\r\nArya Samagaras. The latter speak Marathi. Though the Samagaras are\r\nin the general estimation as low a caste as the Holeyas, and do not\r\nmaterially differ from them in their religious and other ceremonies\r\nand customs, they are, as a rule, of much fairer complexion, and the\r\nwomen are often very handsome. The tanning industry is chiefly carried\r\non by the Samagaras, and their modus operandi is as follows. The\r\nhides are soaked for a period of one month in large earthen vats\r\ncontaining water, to which chunam is added at the rate of two seers\r\nper hide. After the expiry of the above period, they are soaked in\r\nfresh water for three days, in view to the chunam being removed. They\r\nare then put into an earthen vessel filled with water and the leaves\r\nof Phyllanthus Emblica, in which they remain for twelve days. After\r\nthis, they are removed and squeezed, and replaced in the same vessel,\r\nwhere they are allowed to remain for about a month, after which\r\nperiod they are again removed, washed and squeezed. They are then\r\nsewn up and stuffed with the bark of cashew, daddala, and nerale\r\ntrees, and hung up for a day. After this, the stitching is removed,\r\nand the hides are washed and exposed to the sun to dry for a day,\r\nwhen they become fit for making sandals. Some of the hides rot in\r\nthis process to such an extent as to become utterly unfit for use.\"\r\n\r\nThe badge of the Are Samagara at Conjeeveram is said [136] to be the\r\ninsignia of the Mochis (or Mucchis), a boy's kite.\r\n\r\nSamantan.--\"This,\" the Census Superintendent, 1891, writes, \"may be\r\ncalled the caste of Malayalam Rajahs and chieftains, but it is hardly\r\na separate caste at all, at any rate at present, for those Nayars and\r\nothers who have at any time been petty chieftains in the country, call\r\nthemselves Samantas. The primary meaning of the word Samanta is given\r\nby Dr. Gundert [137] as the chief of a district.\" The number of people\r\nwho returned themselves as Samantas (including a few Samantan Brahmans)\r\nat the Census, 1881, was 1,611, and in 1901 they increased to 4,351.\r\n\r\nIn a suit brought against the Collector of Malabar (Mr. Logan)\r\nsome years ago by one Nilambur Thachara Kovil Mana Vikrama, alias\r\nElaya Tirumalpad, the plaintiff entered an objection to his being\r\nsaid by the Collector to be of \"a caste (Nayar), who are permitted\r\nto eat fish and flesh, except of course beef.\" He stated in court\r\nthat he was \"a Samantan by caste, and a Samantan is neither a\r\nBrahman, nor a Kshatriya, nor a Vaisya, nor a Sudra.\" Samantan,\r\naccording to him, is a corruption of Samantran, which, he stated,\r\nmeant one who performs ceremonies without mantrams. He said that\r\nhis caste observes all the ceremonies that Brahmans do, but without\r\nmantrams. And he gave the following as the main points in which his\r\ncaste differs from that of the Nayars. Brahmans can take their food\r\nin the houses of members of his caste, while they cannot do so in\r\nthose of Nayars. At the performance of sradhs in his caste, Brahmans\r\nare fed, while this is not done in the case of Nayars. Brahmans can\r\nprepare water for the purpose of purification in his house, but not\r\nin that of a Nayar. If a Nayar touches a Samantan, he has to bathe\r\nin the same way as a Brahman would have to do. For the performance\r\nof marriages and other ceremonies in his caste, Malabar Brahmans are\r\nabsolutely necessary. At marriages the tali is tied by Kshatriyas. A\r\nSamantan has fourteen days' pollution, while a Nayar has fifteen. He\r\ncan only eat what a Brahman can eat. He added that he was of the same\r\ncaste as the Zamorin of Calicut. A number of witnesses, including the\r\nauthor of the Keralavakhsha Kramam, were examined in support of his\r\nassertions. It was noted by the District Judge that no documentary\r\nevidence was produced, or reference to public records or works of\r\nauthority made in support of the theory as to the existence of a caste\r\nof Samantas who are not Nayars, and are classed under Kshatriyas, and\r\nabove the Vaisyas. The following account is given by the author of the\r\nKeralavakhsha Kramam of the origin of the Samantas. Some Kshatriyas\r\nwho, being afraid of Parasu Rama, were wandering in foreign parts,\r\nand not observing caste rules, came to Malabar, visited Cheraman\r\nPerumal, and asked for his protection. On this Cheraman Perumal,\r\nwith the sanction of the Brahmans, and in pursuance of the rules laid\r\ndown by the Maharajas who had preceded him, classed these people as\r\nmembers of the Samantra caste. \"That this book,\" the Judge observed,\r\n\"can be looked on as being in any way an authority on difficult and\r\nobscure historical questions, or that the story can be classed as more\r\nthan a myth, there are no grounds for supposing.\" No linguistic work\r\nof recognised authority was produced in support of the derivation of\r\nthe word Samantan from Samantran, meaning without mantrams.\r\n\r\nOne exhibit in the case above referred to was an extract from the\r\nreport of a commission appointed to inspect the state and condition\r\nof the province of Malabar. It is dated 11th October, 1793, and in it\r\nallusion is made to the 'Tichera Tiroopaar' who is described as a chief\r\nNayar of Nilambur in the southern division of the country. Evidence was\r\ngiven to show that Tichera Tiroopaar is the Nilambur Tirumulpad. And,\r\nin a letter from the Supervisor of Malabar, dated 15th November,\r\n1793, allusion is made to Tichera Tiroopaar as a Nayar. Two extracts\r\nfrom Buchanan's well-known work on Mysore, Canara and Malabar, were\r\nalso filed as exhibits. In one Buchanan relates what was told him\r\nby the Brahmans of the history of 'Malayala'. Among other things,\r\nhe mentions that Cheraman Perumal, having come to the resolution of\r\nretiring to Mecca, went to Calicut. \"He was there met by a Nayar who\r\nwas a gallant chief, but who, having been absent at the division,\r\nhad obtained no share of his master's dominions. Cheraman Perumal\r\nthereupon gave him his sword, and desired him to keep all that he\r\ncould conquer. From this person's sisters are descended the Tamuri\r\nRajahs or Zamorins.\" In the second extract, Buchanan sums up the\r\nresult of enquiries that he had made concerning the Zamorin and his\r\nfamily. He states that the head of the family is the Tamuri Rajah,\r\ncalled by Europeans the Zamorin, and adds: \"The Tamuri pretends to be\r\nof a higher rank than the Brahmans, and to be inferior only to the\r\ninvisible gods, a pretension that was acknowledged by his subjects,\r\nbut which is held as absurd and abominable by the Brahmans, by whom\r\nhe is only treated as a Sudra.\"\r\n\r\nAn important witness said that he knew the plaintiff, and that he was\r\na Sudra. He stated that he had lived for two years in the Zamorin's\r\nkovilagom, and knew the customs of his family. According to him\r\nthere was no difference between his own caste customs and those of\r\nthe Zamorin. He said that Samantan means a petty chieftain, and drew\r\nattention to the 'Sukra Niti,' edited by Dr. Oppert, where a Samantan\r\nis said to be \"he who gets annually a revenue of from one to three\r\nlakhs karshom from his subjects without oppressing them.\" There are,\r\naccording to him, some Nayars who call themselves Samantas, and he\r\nadded that when, in 1887, the Collector of Malabar called for lists\r\nof all stanom-holders [138] in the district, he examined these lists,\r\nand found that some of the Nayar chiefs called themselves Samantan.\r\n\r\n\"A consideration of all the evidence,\" the Judge writes, \"appears to me\r\nto prove conclusively that the plaintiff is a Nayar by caste.... What\r\nappears to me, from a consideration of the evidence, to be the safe\r\ninference to draw is that the members of the plaintiff's family, and\r\nalso the descendants of certain other of the old Nayar chieftains,\r\nhave for some time called themselves, and been called by others,\r\nSamantas, but that there is no distinctive caste of that name, and\r\nthat the plaintiff is, as the defendant has described him, a Nayar\r\nby caste.\" [139]\r\n\r\nThe Samantans are summed up as follows in the Gazetteer of\r\nMalabar. \"Samantan is the generic name of the group of castes\r\nforming the aristocracy of Malabar, and it includes the following\r\ndivisions:--Nambiyar, Unnitiri, Adiyodi, all belonging to North\r\nMalabar; and Nedungadi, Vallodi, Eradi, and Tirumulpad, all belonging\r\nto South Malabar. There are also Nayars with the title of Nambiyar\r\nand Adiyodi. Nedungadi, Vallodi and Eradi, are territorial names\r\napplied to the Samantans indigenous to Ernad, Walavanad, and Nedunganad\r\nrespectively; or perhaps it may be more correct to say that the tracts\r\nin question take their names from the ruling classes, who formerly\r\nbore sway there. Eradi is the caste to which belongs the Zamorin Raja\r\nof Calicut. It is also the name of a section of Kiriyattil Nayars. The\r\nRaja of Walavanad is a Vallodi. Tirumulpad is the title of a class of\r\nSamantans, to which belong a number of petty chieftains, such as the\r\nKarnamulpad of Manjeri and the Tirumulpad of Nilambur. The ladies\r\nof this class are called Kolpads or Koilammahs. Many Nambiyars in\r\nNorth Malabar claim to belong to the Samantan caste, but there is at\r\nleast reason to suppose that they are properly Nayars, and that the\r\nclaim to the higher rank is of recent date. That such recruitment is\r\ngoing on is indicated by the difference between the number of persons\r\nreturned as Samantans in the censuses of 1901 and 1891 (4,351 and 1,225\r\nrespectively), which is far above the normal percentage of increase of\r\npopulation. Kshatriyas wear the punul (thread); Samantans as a rule do\r\nnot. Most Kshatriyas eat with Brahmans, and have a pollution period of\r\neleven nights, indicating that their position in the caste hierarchy\r\nlies between the Brahmans with ten days and the Ambalavasis proper\r\nwith twelve. Samantans as a rule observe fifteen days' pollution, and\r\nmay not eat with Brahmans. Both follow marumakkatayam (inheritance\r\nin the female line), and their women as a rule have sambandham\r\n(alliance) only with Brahmans or Kshatriyas. Those who belong to the\r\nold Royal families are styled Raja or Tamburan (lord), their ladies\r\nTamburattis, and their houses Kovilagams or palaces. Some Samantans\r\nhave the caste titles of Kartavu and Kaimal. But it does not appear\r\nthat there are really any material differences between the various\r\nclasses of Samantans, other than purely social differences due to\r\ntheir relative wealth and influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tradition,\" writes the Travancore Census Superintendent (1901),\r\n\"traces the Samantas to the prudent Kshatriyas, who cast off the holy\r\nthread, to escape detection and slaughter by Parasu Rama. They are\r\nbelieved to have then fled to uninhabited forests till they forgot\r\nthe Sandhyavandana prayers, and became in certain respects no better\r\nthan Sudras. Thus they came, it is said, to be called Amantrakas,\r\nSamantrakas, Samantas, or having no mantra at all. Referring to\r\nthis, Mr. Stuart says [140] 'Neither philology, nor anything else,\r\nsupports this fable.' From the word Samantra, Samanta can, no doubt,\r\nbe conveniently derived, but, if they could not repeat mantras, they\r\nshould have been called Amantras and not Samantras. In the Kerala\r\nMahatmya we read that the Perumals appointed Samantas to rule over\r\nportions of their kingdom. Taking the Sanskrit word Samanta, we may\r\nunderstand it to mean a petty chief or ruler. It is supposed that\r\nthe Perumals who came to Malabar contracted matrimonial alliances\r\nwith high class Nayar women, and that the issue of such unions were\r\ngiven chiefships over various extents of territories. Changes in\r\ntheir manners and customs were, it is said, made subsequently, by way\r\nof approximation to the Kshatriyas proper. Though the sacred thread,\r\nand the Gayatri hymn were never taken up, less vital changes, as, for\r\ninstance, that of the wearing of the ornaments of the Kshatriya women,\r\nor of consorting only with Nambutiri husbands, were adopted. Those who\r\nlived in Ernat formed themselves by connections and alliances into\r\none large caste, and called themselves Eratis. Those who lived in\r\nValluvanat became Vallotis. The unification could not assume a more\r\ncosmopolitan character as the several families rose to importance at\r\ndifferent times, and, in all probability, from different sections of\r\nthe Nayars.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Travancore Census Report (1901) the chief divisions of the\r\nSamantas are said to be Atiyoti, Unyatiri, Pantala, Erati, Valloti,\r\nand Netungati. \"The Unyatiris,\" the Travancore Census Superintendent\r\nwrites further, \"look upon themselves as a higher class than the rest\r\nof the Samantas, as they have an Aryapattar to tie the tali of their\r\ngirls, the other five castes employing only Kshatriyas (Tirumulpats)\r\nfor that duty. The word Atiyoti has sometimes been derived from Atiyan,\r\na slave or vassal, the tradition being that the Kattanat Raja, having\r\nonce been ousted from his kingdom by the Zamorin of Calicut, sought\r\nthe assistance of the Raja of Chirakkal. The latter is believed\r\nto have made the Kattanat Raja his vassal as a condition for his\r\nterritory being restored. The Unnittiris are not found in Travancore,\r\ntheir place being taken by the Unyatiris, who do not differ from them\r\nmaterially in any of their manners and customs. The word Unnittiri\r\nmeans the venerable boy, and is merely a title of dignity. The word\r\nPantala comes from Bhandarattil, meaning 'in or belonging to the\r\nroyal treasury'. They appear to have been once the ruling chiefs of\r\nsmall territories. Their women are known as Kovilammamar, i.e., the\r\nladies of palaces or ranis. The Erati, the Valloti, and Netungati are\r\nBritish Malabar castes, and receive their names from the localities,\r\nto which they may have been indigenous--Ernat, Valluvanat, and\r\nNetunganat. The Zamorin of Calicut is an Erati by caste. [In 1792,\r\nthe Joint Commissioners wrote that 'the Cartinaad and Samoory\r\n(the principal families in point of extent of dominion) are of the\r\nSamanth or Euree (cowherd) caste.'] [141] Some of these Eratis, such\r\nas the Raja of Nilambur, are called Tirumulpats. The only peculiarity\r\nwith these Tirumulpats is that they may tie the tali of their women,\r\nand need not call other Tirumulpats for the purpose, as the rest of\r\nthe Samantas have to do. A title that several Samantas often take is\r\nKartavu (agent or doer), their females being called Koilpats, meaning\r\nliterally those who live in palaces. The Samantas of Manchery and\r\nAmarampalam in Malabar are also called Tirumulpats. The Samantas of\r\nChuntampattai and Cherupulasseri are called Kartavus. Both Kartas and\r\nTirumulpats are called by the Sudra castes Tampuran or prince. The\r\ncaste government of the Samantas rests with the Namputiri Vaidikas,\r\nand their priesthood is undertaken by the Namputiris. They follow\r\nthe marumakkathayam law of inheritance (through the female line), and\r\nobserve both the forms of marriage in vogue in the country, namely,\r\ntali-kettu and sambandham. Women wear the three special ornaments of\r\nthe Kshatriyas, viz., the mittil or cherutali, entram, and kuzhal. The\r\nchief of these is the mittil, which is used as the wedding ornament. It\r\nhas the appearance of Rama's parasu or battle-axe. The houses of\r\nthose Samantas, who are or were till recently rulers of territories,\r\nare known as kottarams or palaces, while those of the commonalty are\r\nmerely called mathams, a name given to the houses of Brahmans not\r\nindigenous to Malabar. The occupations, which the Samantas pursue, are\r\nchiefly personal attendance on the male and female members of Royal\r\nfamilies. Others are landlords, and a few have taken to the learned\r\nprofessions.\" In the Cochin Census Report, 1901, it is stated that\r\n\"Samantas and Ambalavasis do not interdine. At public feasts they\r\nsit together for meals. Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Nampidis, and most of\r\nthe Ambalavasi castes, do not take water from them. Birth and death\r\npollution last for eleven days.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Civil List of titles and title-holders, the Zamorin\r\nof Calicut, and the Valiya Rajas of Chirakkal, Kadattanad, Palghat,\r\nand Waluvanad, are returned as Samantas.\r\n\r\nSamanthi (Chrysanthemum indicum).--An exogamous sept of Kuruba and\r\nTogata. The flowers of the chrysanthemum are largely used for garlands,\r\netc., in temple worship.\r\n\r\nSamantiya.--The Samantiyas are an Oriya caste of agricultural\r\nlabourers and firewood sellers. It has been suggested that the caste\r\nname is derived from samantiba, which denotes sauntering to pick up\r\nscattered things. The Samantiyas are one of the castes, whose touch\r\nis supposed to convey pollution, and they consequently live apart in\r\nseparate quarters.\r\n\r\nAll the Samantiyas are said to belong to the nagasa (cobra) gotra. The\r\nheadman is called Behara, and he is assisted by an official called\r\nPoricha. There is also a caste servant entitled Dogara. The caste\r\ntitle is Podhano, which is also frequently given out as being the\r\nname of the caste.\r\n\r\nSamantiya women will not eat food prepared by Brahmans or members of\r\nother castes, and they apparently object to cooking in open places\r\nwhen travelling, and leave this work for the men to perform. An\r\nOriya Brahman purohit officiates at the marriage ceremonies, which,\r\nwith slight variations, conform to the standard Oriya type. The\r\nmarriage pandal (booth) is generally covered with cocoanut leaves and\r\nleafy twigs of Eugenia Jambolana and Zizyphus Jujuba. Four lights,\r\nand a vessel of water, are kept on the dais throughout the marriage\r\nceremonies. The knot, with which the cloths of the bride and bridegroom\r\nare tied together, is untied on the evening of the bibha (wedding)\r\nday, instead of on the seventh day as among many other castes.\r\n\r\nSamanto.--A title of Jatapus, and other Oriya castes.\r\n\r\nSamaya.--In his 'Inscriptions at Sravana Belgola' in Mysore,\r\nMr. Lewis Rice refers to the Samaya as \"Dasaris or Vaishnava religious\r\nmendicants, invested with authority as censors of morals. No religious\r\nceremony or marriage could be undertaken without gaining their consent\r\nby the payment of fees, etc. Under the former Rajas the office was\r\nfarmed out in all the large towns, and credited in the public accounts\r\nas samayachara. An important part of the profits arose either from the\r\nsale of women accused of incontinency, or from fines imposed on them\r\nfor the same reason. The unfortunate women were popularly known as\r\nSarkar (Government) wives.\" \"The rules of the system,\" Wilks writes,\r\n[142] \"varied according to the caste of the accused. Among Brahmans\r\nand Komatis, females were not sold, but expelled from their caste,\r\nand branded on the arm as prostitutes. They then paid to the ijardar\r\n(or contractor) an annual sum as long as they lived, and, when\r\nthey died, all their property became his. Females of other Hindu\r\ncastes were sold without any compunction by the ijardar, unless some\r\nrelative stepped forward to satisfy his demand. These sales were not,\r\nas might be supposed, conducted by stealth, nor confined to places\r\nremote from general observation; for, in the large town of Bangalore,\r\nunder the very eyes of the European inhabitants, a large building\r\nwas appropriated to the accommodation of these unfortunate women,\r\nand, so late as 1833, a distinct proclamation of the Commissioners\r\nwas necessary to enforce the abolition of this detestable traffic.\"\r\n\r\nSamayamuvaru.--An itinerant class of mendicants attached to the\r\nSale caste. From a note by Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao, I gather that they\r\nsay that the name is an abbreviation of Ranasamayamuvaru, or men of\r\nthe day of battle. According to a legend, when Bhavana Rishi, the\r\npatron saint of the caste, was challenged to battle by Kalavasina,\r\na rakshasa, these people were created, and, with their assistance,\r\nthe rakshasa was conquered. In recognition of their services, Bhavana\r\nRishi made the Sales maintain them. They wander from place to place in\r\nsingle families, and, when they reach a halting-place, dress up, and\r\nvisit the house of the Pedda Senapati (headman), who feeds them for\r\nthe day, and gives a chit (note) showing the amount paid by him. At\r\ntheir visits to Sale houses, Bhavana Rishi is praised. They marry in\r\nthe presence of, and with the aid of the Sales.\r\n\r\nSamban.--Samban, meaning Samba or Siva, has been recorded as a\r\nsub-division of Idaiyan and Paraiyan. At times of census, Sambuni Kapu\r\nhas been returned as the caste name by some Palle fishermen in Nellore.\r\n\r\nSambandham.--Sambandham, meaning literally connexion, is \"the term\r\nused by the Nayars [and other castes] of South Malabar to denote that a\r\nman and woman are united by a quasi-matrimonial bond.\" [143] In Act IV\r\nof 1896, Madras, sambandham is defined as \"an alliance between a man\r\nand a woman, by reason of which they, in accordance with the custom\r\nof the community, to which they belong, or either of them belongs,\r\ncohabit or intend to cohabit as husband and wife.\"\r\n\r\nSame (millet: Panicum miliare).--An exogamous sept of Kuruba.\r\n\r\nSami Puli (holy tiger).--An exogamous sept of Kallan.\r\n\r\nSammathi Makkal (hammer-men).--An exogamous section of Kallan.\r\n\r\nSammeraya.--A name for Telugu beggars employed as servants and\r\nmessengers by the heads of Lingayat mutts (religious institutions). It\r\nis derived from samme, denoting confederacy or league, and denotes\r\nthose who are bound to the rules laid down by Lingayats.\r\n\r\nSamolo.--A title of Doluva.\r\n\r\nSampige.--Sampige and Sampangi (champac: Michelia Champaca) have been\r\nrecorded as an exogamous sept of Kurni and Odde. Champac flowers are\r\nused in the manufacture of temple garlands.\r\n\r\nSamudra.--Samudra, Samudram, or Samudrala, meaning the ocean, has been\r\nrecorded as an exogamous sept of Telugu Brahmans, Koravas, Kurubas,\r\nBalijas, and Malas. The equivalent Tamudri occurs as the title of\r\nthe Zamorin, who is the sea-king or ruler of Calicut.\r\n\r\nSani.--The Sanivallu, who are a Telugu dancing-girl caste, are\r\ndescribed, in the Vizagapatam Manual, as women who have not entered\r\ninto matrimony, gain money by prostitution, and acting as dancers at\r\nfeasts. Sani is also a title of the Oriya Doluvas in Ganjam, who are\r\nsaid to be descended from Puri Rajas by their concubines. The streets\r\noccupied by Sanis are, in Ganjam, known as Sani vidhi. I have heard of\r\nmissionaries, who, in consequence of this name, insist on their wives\r\nbeing addressed as Ammagaru instead of by the customary name Dorasani.\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Sanis of the Godavari district, Mr. F. R. Hemingway\r\nwrites as follows. \"In this district, dancing-girls and prostitutes\r\nare made up of six perfectly distinct castes, which are in danger\r\nof being confused. These are the Sanis proper, Bogams, Dommara\r\nSanis, Turaka Sanis, Mangala Bogams, and Madiga Bogams. Of these,\r\nthe Bogams claim to be superior, and will not dance in the presence\r\nof, or after a performance by any of the others. The Sanis do not\r\nadmit this claim, but they do not mind dancing after the Bogams, or\r\nin their presence. All the other classes are admittedly inferior to\r\nthe Sanis and the Bogams. The Sanis would scorn to eat with any of\r\nthe other dancing castes. The Sani women are not exclusively devoted\r\nto their traditional profession. Some of them marry male members\r\nof the caste, and live respectably with them. The men do not, as\r\namong the dancing castes of the south, assist in the dancing, or by\r\nplaying the accompaniments or forming a chorus, but are cultivators\r\nand petty traders. Like the dancing-girls of the south, the Sanis\r\nkeep up their numbers by the adoption of girls of other castes. They\r\ndo service in the temples, but they are not required to be formally\r\ndedicated or married to the god, as in the Tamil country. Those of\r\nthem who are to become prostitutes are usually married to a sword on\r\nattaining puberty.\"\r\n\r\nSani, meaning apparently cow-dung, occurs as a sub-division of the\r\nTamil Agamudaiyans.\r\n\r\nSanjogi.--The Sanjogis are an Oriya class of religious mendicants,\r\nwho wear the sacred thread, and act as priests for Panos and other\r\nlowly people. The name indicates connection, and that they are the\r\nconnecting link between ordinary people and those who have given up\r\nearthly pleasures (Sanyasis). The Sanjogis follow the ordinary as\r\nwell as the ascetic life. Mr. G. Ramamurti Pantulu informs me that\r\nthey are believed to be the offspring of ascetics who have violated\r\ntheir vow of celibacy, and women with whom they have lived. They make\r\nand sell bead rosaries of the sacred tulsi or basil (Ocimum sanctum)\r\nwhich are worn by various Oriya castes. Some are cultivators, while\r\nothers are beggars. A Sanjogi beggar goes about with a bell on the\r\nthigh, and a coloured pot on the left shoulder. A few are employed\r\nat Oriya maths (religious institutions), where it is their duty to\r\ninvite Bairagis and ascetics to a dinner party, and afterwards to\r\nremove the leaf platters, and eat the food which is left.\r\n\r\nSankati (ragi or millet pudding).--An exogamous sept of Boya. Ragi\r\nis the staple dietary of many of the lower classes, who cannot\r\nafford rice.\r\n\r\nSanku.--Sanku, the conch or chank (Turbinella rapa) has been\r\nrecorded as a sub-division of Dasaris, Koppala Velamas, and\r\nParaiyans who act as conch-blowers at funerals, and as an exogamous\r\nsept of Kuruba. Sankukatti, or those who tie the chank, occurs as a\r\nsub-division of Idaiyan. The chank shell, which is regularly collected\r\nby divers off Tuticorin in the Tinnevelly district, is highly prized by\r\nHindus, and used for offering libations, and as a musical instrument\r\nat temple services, marriages, and other ceremonials. Vaishnavites\r\nand Madhvas are branded with the emblems of the chank and chakram. The\r\nrare right-handed chank shell is specially valued, and purchased for\r\nlarge sums. A legend, recorded by Baldæus, runs to the effect that\r\n\"Garroude (Garuda) flew in all haste to Brahma, and brought to Kistna\r\nthe chianko or kinkhorn twisted to the right\". Such a shell appears on\r\nthe coat-of-arms of the Raja of Cochin and on the coins of Travancore.\r\n\r\nSanno (little).--A sub-division of Bottada, Omanaito, Pentiya,\r\nand Sondi.\r\n\r\nSanror.--A synonym of Shanans, who claim that Shanan is derived from\r\nSanror, meaning the learned or noble.\r\n\r\nSantarasi.--An exogamous sept of Dandasi. The members thereof may\r\nnot use mats made of the sedge of this name.\r\n\r\nSantha (a fair).--An exogamous sept of Devanga and Odde.\r\n\r\nSanto.--A sub-division of Oriya Brahmans and Bhayipuos.\r\n\r\nSanyasi.--\"A Sanyasi is literally a man who has forsaken all, and\r\nwho has renounced the world and leads a life of celibacy, devoting\r\nhimself to religious meditation and abstraction, and to the study\r\nof holy books. He is considered to have attained a state of exalted\r\npiety that places him above most of the restrictions of caste and\r\nceremony. His is the fourth Asrama or final stage of life recommended\r\nfor the three higher orders. [\"Having performed religious acts in a\r\nforest during the third portion of his life, let him become a Sanyasi,\r\nfor the fourth portion of it, abandoning all sensual affection.\" [144]]\r\nThe number of Brahman Sanyasis is very small; they are chiefly the\r\nGurus or High Priests of the different sects. These are, as a rule,\r\nmen of learning, and heads of monasteries, where they have a number of\r\ndisciples under instruction and training for religious discussion. They\r\nare supported entirely by endowments and the contributions of their\r\ndisciples. They undertake periodical tours for the purpose of receiving\r\nthe offerings of their followers. Since the Sanyasi is considered to\r\nbe above all sin, and to have acquired sufficient merit for salvation,\r\nno sradha is performed by the children born to him before he became\r\nan anchorite. [The skull of a Sanyasi is broken after death, as a\r\nguarantee of his passage to eternal bliss. Cf. Gosayi.] The corpse\r\nof a Sanyasi is buried, and never burnt, or thrown into the river.\r\n\r\n\"The majority of the Sanyasis found, and generally known as such,\r\nare a class of Sudra devotees, who live by begging, and pretend to\r\npowers of divination. They wear garments coloured with red ochre,\r\nand allow the hair to grow unshorn. They often have settled abodes,\r\nbut itinerate. Many are married, and their descendants keep up the\r\nsect, and follow the same calling.\" [145]\r\n\r\nSapiri.--A synonym of Relli.\r\n\r\nSappaliga.--It is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that\r\n\"in some taluks of South Canara they are said to be identical with,\r\nor a sub-caste of Ganiga.\" The Ganigas are a Canarese caste, of which\r\nthe traditional occupation is oil-pressing. In the Manual of the South\r\nCanara district, it is recorded that \"Sappaligs appear to be identical\r\nwith the Devadigas (temple musicians) in North Canara, though they\r\nare regarded as distinct castes in South Canara. The Sappaligs are,\r\nas the name sappal (noise) implies, a class of musicians in temples,\r\nbut a number of them are cultivators.\" Sappaliga is an occupational\r\nterm. The musicians among the Tulu Moger fishing caste are called\r\nSappaligas, in the same way that those Mogers who are engaged as\r\noil-pressers are called Ganigas, both being occupational names.\r\n\r\nSara (thread).--A gotra of Kurni.\r\n\r\nSaragu (dried or withered leaves).--A sub-division of Valaiyan.\r\n\r\nSarangulu.--Recorded, in the Nellore district, as being sailors. The\r\nname is doubtless equivalent to Serang, which has been defined [146]\r\nas meaning \"a native boatswain, or chief of a lascar crew; the skipper\r\nof a small native vessel.\"\r\n\r\nSarattu (sacred thread).--A sub-division of Kanakkan, members of\r\nwhich wear the sacred thread.\r\n\r\nSarayi (alcoholic liquor).--A sub-division of Balija.\r\n\r\nSarige (lace).--The name of a class of gold-lace makers in Mysore,\r\nand of an exogamous sept of Kuruba.\r\n\r\nSastri.--In the Madras Census Report, 1901, Sastri (one learned in\r\nthe shastras) is described as \"unrecognizable. The word is used as a\r\ntitle by Smarta Brahmans in the Madras Presidency, but the persons\r\nreturning it came from Bombay, and were not Brahmans.\" Sastri is\r\nrecorded in my notes as a title of Devangas.\r\n\r\nSatani.--The Satanis are described in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1891, as \"a class of temple servants very much like the Malis of\r\nBengal. The word Satani is a corrupt form of Sattadavan, which,\r\nliterally means one who does not wear (the sacred thread and tuft\r\nof hair). For temple services Ramanuja classed Vaishnavites into\r\nSattinavan and Sattadavan. The former are invariably Brahmans,\r\nand the latter Sudras. Hence Satani is the professional name given\r\nto a group of the Vaishnava creed. It is sometimes stated that the\r\nSatanis of the Madras Presidency are the disciples of the famous\r\nBengali reformer Chaitanya (15th century), from whom, they say, the\r\nterm Satani took its origin. But, so far as I can ascertain, this\r\nsupposition rests on no better foundation than the similarity in sound\r\nof the two names, and it seems to me more than doubtful. There is no\r\nevidence of Chaitanya having ever preached in the Dravidian country,\r\nand the tenets of the Satanis of this Presidency differ widely from\r\nthose of the followers of Chaitanya. The former worship only Krishna,\r\nwhile the latter venerate Vishnu in the form of Narayana also. The\r\nSatanis, too, have as much reverence for Ramanuja as the followers of\r\nChaitanya have towards their guru, who is said to be an incarnation\r\nof Krishna. With regard to their religion, it will suffice to say that\r\nthey are Tengalai Vaishnavites. They shave their heads completely, and\r\ntie their lower cloth like a Brahman bachelor. In their ceremonies they\r\nmore or less follow the Brahmans, but the sacred thread is not worn\r\nby them. Though the consumption of alcoholic liquor and animal food\r\nis strictly prohibited, they practice both to a considerable extent on\r\nall festive occasions, and at sradhs. Drinking and other excesses are\r\ncommon. Some Satanis bury the dead, and others burn them. The principal\r\noccupations of Satanis are making garlands, carrying the torches during\r\nthe god's procession, and sweeping the temple floor. They also make\r\numbrellas, flower baskets and boxes of palmyra leaves, and prepare\r\nthe sacred balls of white clay (for making the Vaishnavite sectarian\r\nmark), and saffron powder. Their usual agnomen is Aiya.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Census Report, 1901, the Satanis are summed up as\r\nbeing \"a Telugu caste of temple servants supposed to have come\r\ninto existence in the time of the great Vaishnavite reformer Sri\r\nRamanujacharya (A.D. 1100). The principal endogamous sub-divisions\r\nof this caste are (1) Ekakshari, (2) Chaturakshari, (3) Ashtakshari,\r\nand (4) Kulasekhara. The Ekaksharis (eka, one, and akshara, syllable)\r\nhope to get salvation by reciting the one mystic syllable Om; the\r\nChaturaksharis believe in the religious efficacy of the four syllables\r\nRa-ma-nu-ja; the Ashtaksharis hold that the recitation of the eight\r\nsyllables Om-na-mo-na-ra-ya-na-ya (Om! salutation to Narayana)\r\nwill ensure them eternal bliss; and the Kulasekharas, who wear the\r\nsacred thread, claim to be the descendants of the Vaishnava saint\r\nKulasekhara Alvar, formerly a king of the Kerala country. The first\r\ntwo sections make umbrellas, flower garlands, etc., and are also\r\npriests to Balijas and other Sudra castes of the Vaishnava sects,\r\nwhile the members of the other two have taken to temple service. In\r\ntheir social and religious customs, all the sub-divisions closely\r\nimitate the Tengalai Vaishnava Brahmans. The marriage of girls after\r\npuberty, and the remarriage of widows, are strictly prohibited. Most\r\nof them employ Brahman purohits, but latterly they have taken to\r\ngetting priests from their own caste. They attach no importance to\r\nthe Sanskrit Vedas, or to the ritual sanctioned therein, but revere\r\nthe sacred hymns of the twelve Vaishnava saints or Alvars, called\r\nNalayira Prabandham (book of the four thousand songs), which is in\r\nTamil. From this their purohits recite verses during marriages and\r\nother ceremonies.\" At the census, 1901, Ramanuja was returned as\r\na sub-caste of Satani. In the Manual of the North Arcot district,\r\nMr. H. A. Stuart describes the Satanis as \"a mixed religious sect,\r\nrecruited from time to time from other castes, excepting Paraiyans,\r\nleather-workers, and Muhammadans. All the Satanis are Vaishnavites,\r\nbut principally revere Bashyakar (another name for Ramanuja), whom they\r\nassert to have been an incarnation of Vishnu. The Satanis are almost\r\nentirely confined to the large towns. Their legitimate occupations are\r\nperforming menial services in Vishnu temples, begging, tending flower\r\ngardens, selling flower garlands, making fans, grinding sandalwood\r\ninto powder, and selling perfumes. They are the priests of some Sudra\r\ncastes, and in this character correspond to the Saivite Pandarams.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Census Report, 1871, the Satanis are described as being\r\n\"frequently religious mendicants, priests of inferior temples,\r\nminstrels, sellers of flowers used as offerings, etc., and have\r\nprobably recruited their numbers by the admission into their ranks\r\nof individuals who have been excommunicated from higher castes. As a\r\nmatter of fact, many prostitutes join this sect, which has a recognised\r\nposition among the Hindus. This can easily be done by the payment of\r\ncertain fees, and by eating in company with their co-religionists. And\r\nthey thus secure for themselves decent burial with the ceremonial\r\nobservances necessary to ensure rest to the soul.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Mysore Census Report, 1891, it is noted that Satanis are\r\nalso styled Khadri Vaishnavas, Sattadaval, Chatali, Kulasekhara,\r\nand Sameraya. These names, however, seem to have pricked their\r\namour propre in the late census, and they took considerable pains\r\nnot only to cast them off, but also to enrol themselves as Prapanna\r\nVaishnavas, Nambi, Venkatapura Vaishnavas, etc. The idea of being\r\ntabulated as Sudras was so hateful to them that, in a few places, the\r\nenumerators, who had so noted down their caste according to precedent,\r\nwere prosecuted by them for defamation. The cases were of course thrown\r\nout. Further, the Mysore Census Superintendent, 1901, writes that \"the\r\nsub-divisions of the Satanis are Khadri Vaishnavas, Natacharamurti,\r\nPrathama Vaishnava, Sameraya or Samogi, Sankara, Suri, Sattadhava,\r\nTelugu Satani, and Venkatapurada. Some are employed in agriculture,\r\nbut as a rule they are engaged in the service of Vishnu temples,\r\nand are flower-gatherers, torch-bearers, and strolling minstrels.\"\r\n\r\nThe Satanis are also called Dasa Nambis. They are flesh-eaters,\r\nbut some have now become pure vegetarians. There are, for example,\r\nat Srivilliputtur in the Tinnevelly district, a large number who have\r\nabandoned a meat dietary. They are connected with the temple of Andal,\r\nand supply flowers and tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) leaves for worship,\r\ncarry torches before the goddess during processions, and watch the\r\ngate of the temple during the night. The small income which they\r\nderive from the temple is supplemented by the manufacture and sale of\r\npalmyra leaf baskets, and umbrellas made from Pandanus leaves. As a\r\nclass, the Satanis are given to liquor, and all important ceremonial\r\noccasions are made the excuse for copious potations. This weakness is\r\nso well known that, in the north of the Presidency, the term Ramanuja\r\nMatham is used to denote the consumption of meat and drink at death or\r\nsradh ceremonies, just as Saivam signifies vegetarianism. The Satani\r\nmendicant can be recognised by the peculiar flat gourd-shaped brass pot\r\nand palm leaf fan which he carries. The Satanis claim to have sprung\r\nfrom the sweat of Virat Purusha (lord of the universe). The following\r\nlegend is told, as accounting for the removal of the kudumi (tuft of\r\nhair on the head), and wearing the cloth without a fold behind. In\r\nthe time of Ramanuja, the Satanis enjoyed certain privileges in the\r\ntemples, but, not satisfied with these, they claimed to take rank next\r\nto Brahmans. This privilege was accorded, and, when flowers and other\r\nthings used in the worship of the god were to be distributed, they\r\nwere handed over to the Satanis. They, however, were unable to decide\r\nwho should be deputed to represent the community, each person decrying\r\nthe others as being of low caste. Ramanuja accordingly directed that\r\nthey should shave their heads, and wear their loin-cloths with a fold\r\nin front only.\r\n\r\nIn addition to other occupations already noted, Satanis sell\r\nturmeric, coloured powders, and sacred balls of white clay used by\r\nVaishnavites. Some act as priests to Balijas and Komatis, at whose\r\ndeath ceremonies the presence of a Satani is essential. Immediately\r\nafter death, the Satani is summoned, and he puts sect marks on\r\nthe corpse. At the grave, cooked food is offered, and eaten by the\r\nSatani and members of the family of the deceased. On the last day of\r\nthe death ceremonies (karmandiram), the Satani comes to the house\r\nof the dead person late in the evening, bringing with him certain\r\nidols, which are worshipped with offerings of cooked rice, flesh,\r\nand liquor in jars. The food is distributed among those present,\r\nand the liquor is doled out from a spoon called parikam, or a broom\r\ndipped in the liquor, which is drunk as it drips therefrom.\r\n\r\nSatani women dress just like Vaishnava Brahman women, from whom it\r\nis difficult to distinguish them. In former days, the Satanis used to\r\nobserve a festival called ravikala (bodice) utchavam, which now goes\r\nby the name of gandapodi (sandal powder) utchavam. The festival, as\r\noriginally carried out, was a very obscene rite. After the worship\r\nof the god by throwing sandal powder, etc., the Satanis returned\r\nhome, and indulged in copious libations of liquor. The women threw\r\ntheir bodices into vessel, and they were picked out at random by the\r\nmen. The woman whose bodice was thus secured became the partner of\r\nthe man for the day.\r\n\r\nFor the following note on Satanis in the Vizagapatam district, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. Satani is said to be the shortened\r\nform of Saththadavan, the uncovered man. They are prohibited from\r\ncovering three different parts of their bodies, viz., the head with\r\nthe usual tuft of hair, the body with the sacred thread, and the waist\r\nwith the customary strip of cloth. All devout Satanis shave their\r\nheads completely. [There is a proverb \"Tie a knot on the Satani's\r\ntuft of hair, and on the ascetic's holy thread.\" The Satanis shave\r\nthe whole head, and the Sanyasis have no sacred thread.] [147] The\r\ncaste is divided into exogamous septs, or intiperulu. The custom of\r\nmenarikam, according to which a man marries his maternal uncle's\r\ndaughter, is observed. The remarriage of widows and divorce are\r\nnot allowed. Attempts have been made by some members of the caste,\r\nin other parts of the Madras Presidency, to connect themselves with\r\nChaitanya. But, so far as the Vizagapatam district is concerned,\r\nthis is repudiated. They are Ramanuja Vaishnavas of the Tenkalai\r\npersuasion. Their gurus are known as Paravasthuvaru--a corruption of\r\nParavasu Deva, whose figure is on the vimana of the Srirangam temple,\r\nand who must be visited before entering the principal sanctuary. They\r\nlive at Gumsur in Ganjam, and have Sadacharulu, or ever-devout\r\nfollowers, who act as their agents in Vizagapatam. They brand the\r\nshoulders of Satanis with the Vaishnavite emblems, the sankha and\r\nchakra, and initiate them into the mysteries of the Vaishnava religion\r\nby whispering into their ears the word Ramanuja. The Satani learns by\r\nheart various songs in eulogy of Srirangam and its deity, by means\r\nof which he earns his living. He rises in the early morning, and,\r\nafter a bath, adorns his forehead and body with the Vaishnavite namam,\r\nties round his clean-shaved head a string of tulsi (Ocimum sanctum)\r\nbeads known as thirupavithram, puts a tulsi garland round his neck,\r\nand takes a fan called gajakarnam, or elephant's ear, in his right\r\nhand. In his left hand he carries a copper gourd-shaped vessel. He\r\nis generally accompanied by another Satani similarly got up. When\r\nbegging, they sing the songs referred to above, and collect the rice\r\nwhich is given to them in their vessels. At the end of their round\r\nthey return home, and their wives clean the rice, bow down before\r\nit, and cook it. No portion of the rice obtained by begging should\r\nbe sold for money. The Satanis play an important part in the social\r\nlife of the Vaishnavites of the district, and are the gurus of some\r\nof the cultivating and other classes. They preside at the final\r\ndeath ceremonies of the non-Brahman Vaishnavite castes. They burn\r\ntheir dead, and perform the chinna (little) and pedda rozu (big day)\r\ndeath ceremonies.\r\n\r\nSathu.--A synonym, meaning a company of merchants or travellers,\r\nof Perike and Janappan.\r\n\r\nSaurashtra.--A synonym of the Patnulkarans, derived from the Saurashtra\r\ncountry, whence they came southward. They also style themselves\r\nSaurashtra Brahmans.\r\n\r\nSavalaikkaran.--A Tamil name for fishermen, who fish in the\r\nsea. Savalai or saval thadi is the flattened paddle used for rowing\r\nboats. The Savalaikkarans are more akin to the Pallis or Vanniyans\r\nthan to the Sembadavans. Though a large number are agriculturists,\r\nsome play on the nagasaram (reed instrument). In the Tinnevelly\r\ndistrict, where Melakkarans are scarce, the temple musicians are either\r\nSavalaikkarans or Panisavans. The agricultural Savalaikkarans use the\r\ntitle Padayachi, and the musicians the title Annavi. Their marriages\r\nlast three days, and the milk-post is made of teak-wood. Widow\r\nremarriage is prohibited. The dead are always buried. Socially they\r\nare on a par with the Maravans, with whom they interdine.\r\n\r\nSavali.--A synonym of Budubudike.\r\n\r\nSavantiya.--A synonym of Samantiya.\r\n\r\nSavara.--The Savaras, Sawaras, or Saoras, are an important\r\nhill-tribe in Ganjam and Vizagapatam.The name is derived by\r\nGeneral Cunningham from the Scythian sagar, an axe, in reference\r\nto the axe which they carry in their hands. In Sanskrit, sabara or\r\nsavara means a mountaineer, barbarian, or savage. The tribe has\r\nbeen identified by various authorities with the Suari of Pliny\r\nand Sabarai of Ptolemy. \"Towards the Ganges,\" the latter writes,\r\n\"are the Sabarai, in whose country the diamond is found in great\r\nabundance.\" This diamond-producing country is located by Cunningham\r\nnear Sambalpur in the Central Provinces. In one of his grants,\r\nNandivarma Pallavamalla, a Pallava king, claims to have released\r\nthe hostile king of the Sabaras, Udayana by name, and captured his\r\nmirror-banner made of peacock's feathers. The Rev. T. Foulkes [148]\r\nidentifies the Sabaras of this copper-plate grant with the Savaras of\r\nthe eastern ghats. But Dr. E. Hultzsch, who has re-edited the grant,\r\n[149] is of opinion that these Sabaras cannot be identified with\r\nthe Savaras. The Aitareya Brahmana of the Rig-veda makes the Savaras\r\nthe descendants of the sons of Visvamitra, who were cursed to become\r\nimpure by their father for an act of disobedience, while the Ramayana\r\ndescribes them as having emanated from the body of Vasishta's cow to\r\nfight against the sage Visvamitra.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Savaras is included by Mr. G. A. Grierson [150]\r\nin the Munda family. It has, he writes, \"been largely influenced by\r\nTelugu, and is no longer an unmixed form of speech. It is most closely\r\nrelated to Kharia and Juang, but in some characteristics differs from\r\nthem, and agrees with the various dialects of the language which has\r\nin this (linguistic) survey been described under the denomination\r\nof Kherwari.\"\r\n\r\nThe Savaras are described by Mr. F. Fawcett [151] as being much more\r\nindustrious than the Khonds. \"Many a time,\" he writes, \"have I tried\r\nto find a place for an extra paddy (rice) field might be made, but\r\nnever with success. It is not too much to say that paddy is grown on\r\nevery available foot of arable ground, all the hill streams being\r\nutilized for this purpose. From almost the very tops of the hills,\r\nin fact from wherever the springs are, there are paddy fields; at the\r\ntop of every small area a few square yards, the front perpendicular\r\nrevetment [of large masses of stones] sometimes as large in area\r\nas the area of the field; and larger and larger, down the hillside,\r\ntaking every advantage of every available foot of ground there are\r\nfields below fields to the bottoms of the valleys. The Saoras show\r\nremarkable engineering skill in constructing their paddy fields, and\r\nI wish I could do it justice. They seem to construct them in the most\r\nimpossible places, and certainly at the expense of great labour. Yet,\r\nwith all their superior activity and industry, the Saoras are decidedly\r\nphysically inferior to the Khonds. It seems hard the Saoras should\r\nnot be allowed to reap the benefit of their industry, but must give\r\nhalf of it to the parasitic Bissoyis and their retainers. The greater\r\npart of the Saoras' hills have been denuded of forest owing to the\r\npersistent hacking down of trees for the purpose of growing dry crops,\r\nso much so that, in places, the hills look almost bare in the dry\r\nweather. Nearly all the jungle (mostly sal, Shorea robusta) is cut\r\ndown every few years. When the Saoras want to work a piece of new\r\nground, where the jungle has been allowed to grow for a few years,\r\nthe trees are cut down, and, when dry, burned, and the ground is\r\ngrubbed up by the women with a kind of hoe. The hoe is used on the\r\nsteep hill sides, where the ground is very stony and rocky, and the\r\nstumps of the felled trees are numerous, and the plough cannot be\r\nused. In the paddy fields, or on any flat ground, they use ploughs\r\nof lighter and simpler make than those used in the plains. They use\r\ncattle for ploughing.\" It is noted by Mr. G. V. Ramamurti Pantulu,\r\nin an article on the Savaras, that \"in some cases the Bissoyi,\r\nwho was originally a feudatory chief under the authority of the\r\nzemindar, and in other cases the zemindar claims a fixed rent in\r\nkind or cash, or both. Subject to the rents payable to the Bissoyis,\r\nthe Savaras under them are said to exercise their right to sell or\r\nmortgage their lands. Below the ghats, in the plains, the Savara has\r\nlost his right, and the mustajars or the renters to whom the Savara\r\nvillages are farmed out take half of whatever crops are raised by the\r\nSavaras.\" Mr. Ramamurti states further that a new-comer should obtain\r\nthe permission of the Gomongo (headman) and the Boya before he can\r\nreclaim any jungle land, and that, at the time of sale or mortgage,\r\nthe village elders should be present, and partake of the flesh of the\r\npig sacrificed on the occasion. In some places, the Savaras are said to\r\nbe entirely in the power of Paidi settlers from the plains, who seize\r\ntheir entire produce on the plea of debts contracted at a usurious\r\nrate of interests. In recent years, some Savaras emigrated to Assam\r\nto work in the tea-gardens. But emigration has now stopped by edict.\r\n\r\nThe sub-divisions among the Savaras, which, so far as I can gather,\r\nare recognised, are as follows:--\r\n\r\nA.--Hill Savaras.\r\n\r\n(1) Savara, Jati Savara (Savaras par excellence), or Maliah\r\nSavara. They regard themselves as superior to the other divisions. They\r\nwill eat the flesh of the buffalo, but not of the cow.\r\n\r\n(2) Arsi, Arisi, or Lombo Lanjiya. Arsi means monkey, and Lombo\r\nLanjiya, indicating long-tailed, is the name by which members of this\r\nsection are called, in reference to the long piece of cloth, which\r\nthe males allow to hang down. The occupation is said to be weaving\r\nthe coarse cloths worn by members of the tribe, as well as agriculture.\r\n\r\n(3) Luara or Muli. Workers in iron, who make arrow heads, and other\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n(4) Kindal. Basket-makers, who manufacture rough baskets for holding\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n(5) Jadu. Said to be a name among the Savaras for the hill country\r\nbeyond Kollakota and Puttasingi.\r\n\r\n(6) Kumbi. Potters who make earthen pots. \"These pots,\" Mr. Fawcett\r\nwrites, \"are made in a few villages in the Saora hills. Earthen\r\nvessels are used for cooking, or for hanging up in houses as fetishes\r\nof ancestral spirits or certain deities.\"\r\n\r\nB.--Savaras of the low country.\r\n\r\n(7) Kapu (denoting cultivator), or Pallapu.\r\n\r\n(8) Suddho (good).\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that the pure Savara tribes have restricted\r\nthemselves to the tracts of hill and jungle-covered valleys. But,\r\nas the plains are approached, traces of amalgamation become apparent,\r\nresulting in a hybrid race, whose appearance and manners differ but\r\nlittle from those of the ordinary denizens of the low country. The\r\nKapu Savaras are said to retain many of the Savara customs, whereas\r\nthe Suddho Savaras have adopted the language and customs of the Oriya\r\ncastes. The Kapu section is sometimes called Kudunga or Baseng, and the\r\nlatter name is said by Mr. Ramamurti to be derived from the Savara word\r\nbasi, salt. It is, he states, applied to the plains below the ghats,\r\nas, in the fairs held there, salt is purchased by the Savaras of the\r\nhills, and the name is used to designate the Savaras living there. A\r\nclass name Kampu is referred to by Mr. Ramamurti, who says that the\r\nname \"implies that the Savaras of this class have adopted the customs\r\nof the Hindu Kampus (Oriya for Kapu). Kudumba is another name by which\r\nthey are known, but it is reported that there is a sub-division of them\r\ncalled by this name.\" He further refers to Bobbili and Bhima as the\r\nnames of distinct sub-divisions. Bobbili is a town in the Vizagapatam\r\ndistrict, and Bhima was the second of the five Pandava brothers.\r\n\r\nIn an account of the Maliya Savarulu, published in the 'Catalogue\r\nRaisonné of Oriental Manuscripts,' [152] it is recorded that \"they\r\nbuild houses over mountain torrents, previously throwing trees across\r\nthe chasms; and these houses are in the midst of forests of fifty\r\nor more miles in extent. The reason of choosing such situations is\r\nstated to be in order that they may more readily escape by passing\r\nunderneath their houses, and through the defile, in the event of\r\nany disagreement and hostile attack in reference to other rulers or\r\nneighbours. They cultivate independently, and pay tax or tribute\r\nto no one. If the zemindar of the neighbourhood troubles them for\r\ntribute, they go in a body to his house by night, set it on fire,\r\nplunder, and kill; and then retreat, with their entire households,\r\ninto the wilds and fastnesses. They do in like manner with any of the\r\nzemindar's subordinates, if troublesome to them. If they are courted,\r\nand a compact is made with them, they will then abstain from any wrong\r\nor disturbance. If the zemindar, unable to bear with them, raise\r\ntroops and proceed to destroy their houses, they escape underneath\r\nby a private way, as above mentioned. The invaders usually burn the\r\nhouses, and retire. If the zemindar forego his demands, and make an\r\nagreement with them, they rebuild their houses in the same situations,\r\nand then render assistance to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern Savara settlement is described by Mr. Fawcett as having\r\ntwo rows of huts parallel and facing each other. \"Huts,\" he writes,\r\n\"are generally built of upright pieces of wood stuck in the ground,\r\n6 or 8 inches apart, and the intervals filled in with stones and mud\r\nlaid alternately, and the whole plastered over with red mud. Huts are\r\ninvariably built a few feet above the level of the ground, often, when\r\nthe ground is very uneven, 5 feet above the ground in front. Roofs are\r\nalways thatched with grass. There is usually but one door, near one\r\nend wall; no windows or ventilators, every chink being filled up. In\r\nfront of the doorway there is room for six or eight people to stand,\r\nand there is a loft, made by cross-beams, about 5 feet from the floor,\r\non which grain is stored in baskets, and under which the inmates\r\ncrawl to do their cooking. Bits of sun-dried buffalo meat and bones,\r\nnot smelling over-sweet, are suspended from the rafters, or here and\r\nthere stuck in between the rafters and the thatch; knives, a tangi\r\n(battle-axe), a sword, and bows and arrows may also be seen stuck in\r\nsomewhere under the thatch. Agricultural implements may be seen, too,\r\nsmall ones stuck under the roof or on the loft, and larger ones against\r\nthe wall. As in Ireland, the pig is of sufficient importance to have\r\na room in the house. There is generally merely a low wall between the\r\npig's room and the rest of the house, and a separate door, so that it\r\nmay go in and out without going through that part of the house occupied\r\nby the family. Rude drawings are very common in Saora houses. They\r\nare invariably, if not always, in some way that I could never clearly\r\napprehend, connected with one of the fetishes in the house.\" \"When,\"\r\nMr. Ramamurti writes, \"a tiger enters a cottage and carries away\r\nan inmate, the villages are deserted, and sacrifices are offered to\r\nsome spirits by all the inhabitants. The prevalence of small-pox in\r\na village requires its abandonment. A succession of calamities leads\r\nto the same result. If a Savara has a number of wives, each of them\r\nsometimes requires a separate house, and the house sites are frequently\r\nshifted according to the caprice of the women. The death or disease\r\nof cattle is occasionally followed by the desertion of the house.\"\r\n\r\nWhen selecting a site for a new dwelling hut, the Maliah Savaras place\r\non the proposed site as many grains of rice in pairs as there are\r\nmarried members in the family, and cover them over with a cocoanut\r\nshell. They are examined on the following day, and, if they are all\r\nthere, the site is considered auspicious. Among the Kapu Savaras,\r\nthe grains of rice are folded up in leaflets of the bael tree (Ægle\r\nMarmelos), and placed in split bamboo.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded by Mr. Fawcett, in connection with the use of the\r\nduodecimal system by the Savaras that, \"on asking a Gomango how\r\nhe reckoned when selling produce to the Panos, he began to count\r\non his fingers. In order to count 20, he began on the left foot\r\n(he was squatting), and counted 5; then with the left hand 5 more;\r\nthen with the two first fingers of the right hand he made 2 more,\r\ni.e., 12 altogether; then with the thumb of the right hand and the\r\nother two fingers of the same, and the toes of the right foot he made 8\r\nmore. And so it was always. They have names for numerals up to 12 only,\r\nand to count 20 always count first twelve and then eight in the manner\r\ndescribed, except that they may begin on either hand or foot. To count\r\n50 or 60, they count by twenties, and put down a stone or some mark\r\nfor each twenty. There is a Saora story accounting for their numerals\r\nbeing limited to 12. One day, long ago, some Saoras were measuring\r\ngrain in a field, and, when they had measured 12 measures of some\r\nkind, a tiger pounced in on them and devoured them. So, ever after,\r\nthey dare not have a numeral above 12, for fear of a tiger repeating\r\nthe performance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Savaras are described by Mr. Fawcett as \"below the middle height;\r\nface rather flat; lips thick; nose broad and flat; cheek bones high;\r\neyes slightly oblique. They are as fair as the Uriyas, and fairer\r\nthan the Telugus of the plains. Not only is the Saora shorter and\r\nfairer than other hill people, but his face is distinctly Mongolian,\r\nthe obliquity of the eyes being sometimes very marked, and the inner\r\ncorners of the eyes are generally very oblique. [The Mongolian type\r\nis clearly brought out in the illustration.] The Saora's endurance\r\nin going up and down hill, whether carrying heavy loads or not,\r\nis wonderful. Four Saoras have been known to carry a 10-stone man\r\nin a chair straight up a 3,800 feet hill without relief, and without\r\nrest. Usually, the Saora's dress (his full dress) consists of a large\r\nbunch of feathers (generally white) stuck in his hair on the crown\r\nof his head, a coloured cloth round his head as a turban, and worn\r\nmuch on the back of the head, and folded tightly, so as to be a good\r\nprotection to the head. When feathers are not worn, the hair is tied\r\non the top of the head, or a little at the side of it. A piece of\r\nflat brass is another head ornament. It is stuck in the hair, which\r\nis tied in a knot at the crown of the head, at an angle of about 40°\r\nfrom the perpendicular, and its waving up and down motion as a man\r\nwalks has a curious effect. Another head ornament is a piece of wood,\r\nabout 8 or 9 inches in length and 3/4 inch in diameter, with a flat\r\nbutton about 2 inches in diameter on the top, all covered with hair\r\nor coloured thread, and worn in the same position as the flat piece\r\nof brass. A peacock's feather, or one or two of the tail feathers\r\nof the jungle cock, may be often seen stuck in the knot of hair on\r\nthe top of the head. A cheroot or two, perhaps half smoked, may\r\noften be seen sticking in the hair of a man or woman, to be used\r\nagain when wanted. They also smoke pipes, and the old women seem\r\nparticularly fond of them. Round the Saora's neck are brass and bead\r\nnecklaces. A man will wear as many as thirty necklaces at a time,\r\nor rather necklaces of various lengths passed as many as thirty times\r\nround his neck. Round the Saora's waist, and under his fork, is tied a\r\ncloth with coloured ends hanging in front and behind. When a cloth on\r\nthe body is worn, it is usually worn crossed in front. The women wear\r\nnecklaces like the men. Their hair is tied at the back of the head,\r\nand is sometimes confined with a fillet. They wear only one cloth, tied\r\nround the waist. During feasts, or when dancing, they generally wear\r\na cloth over the shoulders. Every male wears a small ring, generally\r\nof silver, in the right nostril, and every female wears a similar ring\r\nin each nostril, and in the septum. As I have been told, these rings\r\nare put in the nose on the eighth or tenth day after birth. Bangles\r\nare often worn by men and women. Anklets, too, are sometimes worn by\r\nthe women. Brass necklets and many other ornaments are made in Saora\r\nhills by the Gangsis, a low tribe of workers in brass. The Saora's\r\nweapons are the bow, sometimes ornamented with peacock's feathers,\r\nsword, dagger, and tangi. The bow used by the Saoras is much smaller\r\nthan the bow used by any of the other hill people. It is generally\r\nabout 3 1/2 feet long, and the arrows from 18 to 21 inches. The bow\r\nis always made of bamboo, and so is the string. The arrows are reeds\r\ntipped with iron, and leathered on two sides only. A blunt-headed\r\narrow is used for shooting birds. Every Saora can use the bow from\r\nboyhood, and can shoot straight up to 25 or 30 yards.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the marriage customs of the Savaras, Mr. Fawcett writes that\r\n\"a Saora may marry a woman of his own or of any other village. A man\r\nmay have as many as three wives, or, if he is a man of importance,\r\nsuch as Gomango of a large village, he may have four. Not that there\r\nis any law in the matter, but it is considered that three, or at\r\nmost four, are as many as a man can manage. For his first marriage,\r\na man chooses a young woman he fancies; his other wives are perhaps\r\nher sisters, or other women who have come to him. A woman may leave\r\nher husband whenever she pleases. Her husband cannot prevent her. When\r\na woman leaves her husband to join herself to another, the other pays\r\nthe husband she has left a buffalo and a pig. Formerly, it is said,\r\nif he did not pay up, the man she left would kill the man to whom she\r\nwent. Now arbitration comes into play. I believe a man usually takes\r\na second wife after his first has had a child; if he did so before,\r\nthe first wife would say he was impotent. As the getting of the\r\nfirst wife is more troublesome and expensive than getting the others,\r\nshe is treated the best. In some places, all a man's wives are said\r\nto live together peaceably. It is not the custom in the Kolakotta\r\nvillages. Knowing the wives would fight if together, domestic felicity\r\nis maintained by keeping up different establishments. A man's wives\r\nwill visit one another in the daytime, but one wife will never spend\r\nthe night in the house of another. An exception to this is that the\r\nfirst wife may invite one of the other wives to sleep in her house\r\nwith the husband. As each wife has her separate house, so has she her\r\nseparate piece of ground on the hill-side to cultivate. The wives will\r\nnot co-operate in working each other's cultivation, but they will work\r\ntogether, with the husband, in the paddy fields. Each wife keeps the\r\nproduce of the ground she cultivates in her own house. Produce of the\r\npaddy fields is divided into equal shares among the wives. If a wife\r\nwill not work properly, or if she gives away anything belonging to\r\nher husband, she may be divorced. Any man may marry a divorced woman,\r\nbut she must pay to her former husband a buffalo and a pig. If a man\r\ncatches his wife in adultery (he must see her in the act), he thinks he\r\nhas a right to kill her, and her lover too. But this is now generally\r\n(but not always) settled by arbitration, and the lover pays up. A wife\r\ncaught in adultery will never be retained as a wife. As any man may\r\nhave as many as three wives, illicit attachments are common. During\r\nlarge feasts, when the Saoras give themselves up to sensuality,\r\nthere is no doubt a great deal of promiscuous intercourse. A widow\r\nis considered bound to marry her husband's brother, or his brother's\r\nsons if he has no younger brothers. A number of Saoras once came to me\r\nto settle a dispute. They were in their full dress, with feathers and\r\nweapons. The dispute was this. A young woman's husband was dead, and\r\nhis younger brother was almost of an age to take her to wife. She had\r\nfixed her affections on a man of another village, and made up her mind\r\nto have him and no one else. Her village people wanted compensation\r\nin the shape of a buffalo, and also wanted her ornaments. The men of\r\nthe other village said no, they could not give a buffalo. Well, they\r\nshould give a pig at least--no, they had no pig. Then they must give\r\nsome equivalent. They would give one rupee. That was not enough--at\r\nleast three rupees. They were trying to carry the young woman off\r\nby force to make her marry her brother-in-law, but were induced to\r\naccept the rupee, and have the matter settled by their respective\r\nBissoyis. The young woman was most obstinate, and insisted on having\r\nher own choice, and keeping her ornaments. Her village people had no\r\nobjection to her choice, provided the usual compensation was paid.\r\n\r\n\"In one far out-of-the-way village the marriage ceremony consists\r\nin this. The bride's father is plied with liquor two or three times;\r\na feast is made in the bridegroom's house, to which the bride comes\r\nwith her father; and after the feast she remains in the man's house\r\nas his wife. They know nothing of capture. In the Kolakotta valley,\r\nbelow this village, a different custom prevails. The following is\r\nan account of a Saora marriage as given by the Gomango of one of the\r\nKolakotta villages, and it may be taken as representative of the purest\r\nSaora marriage ceremony. 'I wished to marry a certain girl, and, with\r\nmy brother and his son, went to her house. I carried a pot of liquor,\r\nand arrow, and one brass bangle for the girl's mother. Arrived at\r\nthe house, I put the liquor and the arrow on the floor. I and the\r\ntwo with me drank the liquor--no one else had any. The father of the\r\ngirl said 'Why have you brought the liquor?' I said 'Because I want\r\nyour daughter.' He said 'Bring a big pot of liquor, and we will talk\r\nabout it.' I took the arrow I brought with me, and stuck it in the\r\nthatch of the roof just above the wall, took up the empty pot, and\r\nwent home with those who came with me. Four days afterwards, with the\r\nsame two and three others of my village, I went to the girl's father's\r\nhouse with a big pot of liquor. About fifteen or twenty people of\r\nthe village were present. The father said he would not give the girl,\r\nand, saying so, he smashed the pot of liquor, and, with those of his\r\nvillage, beat us so that we ran back to our village. I was glad of the\r\nbeating, as I know by it I was pretty sure of success. About ten days\r\nafterwards, ten or twenty of my village people went with me again,\r\ncarrying five pots of liquor, which we put in the girl's father's\r\nhouse. I carried an arrow, which I stuck in the thatch beside the\r\nfirst one. The father and the girl's nearest male relative each took\r\none of the arrows I had put in the thatch, and, holding them in their\r\nleft hands, drank some of the liquor. I now felt sure of success. I\r\nthen put two more arrows in the father's left hand, holding them in\r\nhis hand with both of my hands over his, and asked him to drink. Two\r\nfresh arrows were likewise placed in the left hands of all the girl's\r\nmale relatives, while I asked them to drink. To each female relative\r\nof the girl I gave a brass bangle, which I put on their right wrists\r\nwhile I asked them to drink. The five pots of liquor were drunk by\r\nthe girl's male and female relations, and the villagers. When the\r\nliquor was all drunk, the girl's father said 'Come again in a month,\r\nand bring more liquor.' In a month I went again, with all the people\r\nof my village, men, women and children, dancing as we went (to music\r\nof course), taking with us thirty pots of liquor, and a little rice\r\nand a cloth for the girl's mother; also some hill dholl (pulse),\r\nwhich we put in the father's house. The liquor was set down in the\r\nmiddle of the village, and the villagers, and those who came with me,\r\ndrank the liquor and danced. The girl did not join in this; she was\r\nin the house. When the liquor was finished, my village people went\r\nhome, but I remained in the father's house. For three days I stayed,\r\nand helped him to work in his fields. I did not sleep with the girl;\r\nthe father and I slept in one part of the house, and the girl and her\r\nmother in another. At the end of the three days I went home. About\r\nten days afterwards, I, with about ten men of my village, went to\r\nwatch for the girl going to the stream for water. When we saw her,\r\nwe caught her, and ran away with her. She cried out and the people of\r\nher village came after us, and fought with us. We got her off to my\r\nvillage, and she remained with me as my wife. After she became my wife,\r\nher mother gave her a cloth and a bangle.\" The same individual said\r\nthat, if a man wants a girl, and cannot afford to give the liquor,\r\netc., to her people, he takes her off by force. If she likes him,\r\nshe remains, but, if not, she runs home. He will carry her off three\r\ntimes, but not oftener; and, if after the third time she again runs\r\naway, he leaves her. The Saoras themselves say that formerly every\r\none took his wife by force. In a case which occurred a few years ago,\r\na bridegroom did not comply with the usual custom of giving a feast\r\nto the bride's people, and the bride's mother objected to the marriage\r\non that account. The bridegroom's party, however, managed to carry off\r\nthe bride. Her mother raised an alarm, whereon a number of people ran\r\nup, and tried to stop the bridegroom's party. They were outnumbered,\r\nand one was knocked down, and died from rupture of the spleen.\r\n\r\nA further account of the Saora marriage customs is given by\r\nMr. Ramamurti Pantulu, who writes as follows. \"When the parents of\r\na young man consider it time to seek a bride for him, they make\r\nenquiries and even consult their relatives and friends as to a\r\nsuitable girl for him. The girl's parents are informally apprised of\r\ntheir selection. On a certain day, the male relatives of the youth\r\ngo to the girl's house to make a proposal of marriage. Her parents,\r\nhaving received previous notice of the visit, have the door of the\r\nhouse open or closed, according as they approve or disapprove of\r\nthe match. On arrival at the house, the visitors knock at the door,\r\nand, if it is open, enter without further ceremony. Sometimes the\r\ndoor is broken open. If the girl's parents object to the match, they\r\nremain silent, and will not touch the liquor brought by the visitors,\r\nand they go away. Should, however, they regard it with favour, they\r\ncharge the visitors with intruding, shower abuse on them, and beat\r\nthem, it may be, so severely that wounds are inflicted, and blood is\r\nshed. This ill-treatment is borne cheerfully, and without resistance,\r\nas it is a sign that the girl's hand will be bestowed on the young\r\nman. The liquor is then placed on the floor, and, after more abuse,\r\nall present partake thereof. If the girl's parents refuse to give\r\nher in marriage after the performance of this ceremony, they have\r\nto pay a penalty to the parents of the disappointed suitor. Two or\r\nthree days later, the young man's relatives go a second time to the\r\ngirl's house, taking with them three pots of liquor, and a bundle\r\ncomposed of as many arrows as there are male members in the girl's\r\nfamily. The liquor is drunk, and the arrows are presented, one to each\r\nmale. After an interval of some days, a third visit is paid, and three\r\npots of liquor smeared with turmeric paste, and a quantity of turmeric,\r\nare taken to the house. The liquor is drunk, and the turmeric paste\r\nis smeared over the back and haunches of the girl's relatives. Some\r\ntime afterwards, the marriage ceremony takes place. The bridegroom's\r\nparty proceed to the house of the bride, dancing and singing to\r\nthe accompaniment of all the musical instruments except the drum,\r\nwhich is only played at funerals. With them they take twenty big\r\npots of liquor, a pair of brass bangles and a cloth for the bride's\r\nmother, and head cloths for the father, brothers, and other male\r\nrelatives. When everything is ready, the priest is called in. One of\r\nthe twenty pots is decorated, and an arrow is fixed in the ground at\r\nits side. The priest then repeats prayers to the invisible spirits\r\nand ancestors, and pours some of the liquor into leaf-cups prepared\r\nin the names of the ancestors [Jojonji and Yoyonji, male and female],\r\nand the chiefs of the village. This liquor is considered very sacred,\r\nand is sprinkled from a leaf over the shoulders and feet of the\r\nelders present. The father of the bride, addressing the priest, says\r\n'Boya, I have drunk the liquor brought by the bridegroom's father,\r\nand thereby have accepted his proposal for a marriage between his son\r\nand my daughter. I do not know whether the girl will afterwards agree\r\nto go to her husband, or not. Therefore it is well that you should ask\r\nher openly to speak out her mind.' The priest accordingly asks the girl\r\nif she has any objection, and she replies 'My father and mother, and\r\nall my relatives have drunk the bridegroom's liquor. I am a Savara, and\r\nhe is a Savara. Why then should I not marry him?' Then all the people\r\nassembled proclaim that the pair are husband and wife. This done, the\r\nbig pot of liquor, which has been set apart from the rest, is taken\r\ninto the bride's house. This pot, with another pot of liquor purchased\r\nat the expense of the bride's father, is given to the bridegroom's\r\nparty when it retires. Every house-holder receives the bridegroom\r\nand his party at his house, and offers them liquor, rice, and flesh,\r\nwhich they cannot refuse to partake of without giving offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever,\" Mr. Ramamurti continues, \"marries a widow, whether it is her\r\nhusband's younger brother or some one of her own choice, must perform a\r\nreligious ceremony, during which a pig is sacrificed. The flesh, with\r\nsome liquor, is offered to the ghost of the widow's deceased husband,\r\nand prayers are addressed by the Boyas to propitiate the ghost, so\r\nthat it may not torment the woman and her second husband. 'Oh! man,'\r\nsays the priest, addressing the deceased by name, 'Here is an animal\r\nsacrificed to you, and with this all connection between this woman\r\nand you ceases. She has taken with her no property belonging to\r\nyou or your children. So do not torment her within the house or\r\noutside the house, in the jungle or on the hill, when she is asleep\r\nor when she wakes. Do not send sickness on her children. Her second\r\nhusband has done no harm to you. She chose him for her husband, and he\r\nconsented. Oh! man, be appeased; Oh! unseen ones; Oh! ancestors, be you\r\nwitnesses.' The animal sacrificed on this occasion is called long danda\r\n(inside fine), or fine paid to the spirit of a dead person inside the\r\nearth. The animal offered up, when a man marries a divorced woman,\r\nis called bayar danda (outside fine), or fine paid as compensation\r\nto a man living outside the earth. The moment that a divorcée marries\r\nanother man, her former husband pounces upon him, shoots his buffalo\r\nor pig dead with an arrow, and takes it to his village, where its\r\nflesh is served up at a feast. The Boya invokes the unseen spirits,\r\nthat they may not be angry with the man who has married the woman,\r\nas he has paid the penalty prescribed by the elders according to the\r\nimmemorial custom of the Savaras.\r\n\r\nFrom a still further account of the ceremonial observances in\r\nconnection with marriage, with variations, I gather that the liquor\r\nis the fermented juice of the salop or sago palm (Caryota urens),\r\nand is called ara-sal. On arrival at the girl's house, on the\r\nfirst occasion, the young man's party sit at the door thereof, and,\r\nmaking three cups from the leaves kiredol (Uncaria Gambier) or jak\r\n(Artocarpus integrifolia), pour the liquor into them, and lay them on\r\nthe ground. As the liquor is being poured into the cups, certain names,\r\nwhich seem to be those of the ancestors, are called out. The liquor\r\nis then drunk, and an arrow (am) is stuck in the roof, and a brass\r\nbangle (khadu) left, before the visitors take their departure. If the\r\nmatch is unacceptable to the girl's family, the arrow and bangle are\r\nreturned. The second visit is called pank-sal, or sang-sang-dal-sol,\r\nbecause the liquor pots are smeared with turmeric paste. Sometimes\r\nit is called nyanga-dal-sol, because the future bridegroom carries\r\na small pot of liquor on a stick borne on the shoulder; or pojang,\r\nbecause the arrow, which has been stuck in the roof, is set up in the\r\nground close to one of the pots of liquor. In some places, several\r\nvisits take place subsequent to the first visit, at one of which,\r\ncalled rodai-sal, a quarrel arises.\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu that, among the Savaras who\r\nhave settled in the low country, some differences have arisen in\r\nthe marriage rites \"owing to the introduction of Hindu custom, i.e.,\r\nthose obtaining among the Sudra castes. Some of the Savaras who are\r\nmore Hinduised than others consult their medicine men as to what\r\nday would be most auspicious for a marriage, erect pandals (booths),\r\ndispense with the use of liquor, substituting for it thick jaggery\r\n(crude sugar) water, and hold a festival for two or three days. But\r\neven the most Hinduised Savara has not yet fallen directly into the\r\nhands of the Brahman priest.\" At the marriage ceremony of some Kapu\r\nSavaras, the bride and bridegroom sit side by side at the auspicious\r\nmoment, and partake of boiled rice (korra) from green leaf-cups, the\r\npair exchanging cups. Before the bridegroom and his party proceed to\r\ntheir village with the bride, they present the males and females of\r\nher village with a rupee, which is called janjul naglipu, or money paid\r\nfor taking away the girl. In another form of Kapu Savara marriage, the\r\nwould-be bridegroom and his party proceed, on an auspicious day, to the\r\nhouse of the selected girl, and offer betel and tobacco, the acceptance\r\nof which is a sign that the match is agreeable to her parents. On a\r\nsubsequent day, a small sum of money is paid as the bride-price. On\r\nthe wedding day the bride is conducted to the home of the bridegroom,\r\nwhere the contracting couple are lifted up by two people, who dance\r\nabout with them. If the bride attempts to enter the house, she is\r\ncaught hold of, and made to pay a small sum of money before she is\r\npermitted to do so. Inside the house, the officiating Desari ties\r\nthe ends of the cloths of the bride and bridegroom together, after\r\nthe ancestors and invisible spirits have been worshipped.\r\n\r\nOf the marriage customs of the Kapu Savaras, the following account\r\nis given in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district. \"The Kapu\r\nSavaras are taking to menarikam (marriage with the maternal uncle's\r\ndaughter), although the hill custom requires a man to marry outside\r\nhis village. Their wedding ceremonies bear a distant resemblance to\r\nthose among the hill Savaras. Among the Kapu Savaras, the preliminary\r\narrow and liquor are similarly presented, but the bridegroom goes at\r\nlength on an auspicious day with a large party to the bride's house,\r\nand the marriage is marked by his eating out of the same platter with\r\nher, and by much drinking, feasting, and dancing.\"\r\n\r\nChildren are named after the day of the week on which they were\r\nborn, and nicknames are frequently substituted for the birth\r\nname. Mr. Fawcett records, for example, that a man was called Gylo\r\nbecause, when a child, he was fond of breaking nuts called gylo, and\r\nsmearing himself with their black juice. Another was called Dallo\r\nbecause, in his youthful days, he was fond of playing about with a\r\nbasket (dalli) on his head.\r\n\r\nConcerning the death rites, Mr. Fawcett writes as follows. \"As soon\r\nas a man, woman, or child dies in a house, a gun, loaded with powder\r\nonly, is fired off at the door, or, if plenty of powder is available,\r\nseveral shots are fired, to frighten away the Kulba (spirit). The\r\ngun used is the ordinary Telugu or Uriya matchlock. Water is poured\r\nover the body while in the house. It is then carried away to the\r\nfamily burning-ground, which is situated from 30 to 80 yards from the\r\ncluster of houses occupied by the family, and there it is burned. [It\r\nis stated by Mr. S. P. Rice [153] that \"the dead man's hands and feet\r\nare tied together, and a bamboo is passed through them. Two men then\r\ncarry the corpse, slung in this fashion, to the burning-ground. When\r\nit is reached, two posts are stuck up, and the bamboo, with the\r\ncorpse tied to it, is placed crosswise on the posts. Then below the\r\ncorpse a fire is lighted. The Savara man is always burnt in the\r\nportion of the ground--one cannot call it a field--which he last\r\ncultivated.\"] The only wood used for the pyre is that of the mango,\r\nand of Pongamia glabra. Fresh, green branches are cut and used. No\r\ndry wood is used, except a few twigs to light the fire. Were any one\r\nto ask those carrying a body to the burning-ground the name of the\r\ndeceased or anything about him, they would be very angry. Guns are\r\nfired while the body is being carried. Everything a man has, his bows\r\nand arrows, his tangi, his dagger, his necklaces, his reaping-hook\r\nfor cutting paddy, his axe, some paddy and rice, etc., are burnt with\r\nhis body. I have been told in Kolakotta that all a man's money too is\r\nburned, but it is doubtful if it really ever is--a little may be. A\r\nKolakotta Gomango told me \"If we do not burn these things with the\r\nbody, the Kulba will come and ask us for them, and trouble us.\" The\r\nbody is burned the day a man dies. The next day, the people of the\r\nfamily go to the burning-place with water, which they pour over the\r\nembers. The fragments of the bones are then picked out, and buried\r\nabout two feet in the ground, and covered over with a miniature hut,\r\nor merely with some thatching grass kept on the place by a few logs\r\nof wood, or in the floor of a small hut (thatched roof without walls)\r\nkept specially for the Kulba at the burning-place. An empty egg-shell\r\n(domestic hen's) is broken under foot, and buried with the bones. It\r\nis not uncommon to send pieces of bone, after burning, to relations\r\nat a distance, to allow them also to perform the funeral rites. The\r\nfirst sacrificial feast, called the Limma, is usually made about\r\nthree or four days after the body has been burnt. In some places,\r\nit is said to be made after a longer interval. For the Limma a fowl\r\nis killed at the burning-place, some rice or other grain is cooked,\r\nand, with the fowl, eaten by the people of the family, with the usual\r\nconsumption of liquor. Of course, the Kudang (who is the medium of\r\ncommunication between the spirits of the dead and the living) is on\r\nthe spot, and communicates with the Kulba. If the deceased left debts,\r\nhe, through the Kudang, tells how they should be settled. Perhaps\r\nthe Kulba asks for tobacco and liquor, and these are given to the\r\nKudang, who keeps the tobacco, and drinks the liquor. After the\r\nLimma, a miniature hut is built for the Kulba over the spot where\r\nthe bones are buried. But this is not done in places like Kolakotta,\r\nwhere there is a special hut set apart for the Kulba. In some parts\r\nof the Saora country, a few logs with grass on the top of them, logs\r\nagain on the top to keep the grass in its place, are laid over the\r\nburied fragments of bones, it is said to be for keeping rain off,\r\nor dogs from disturbing the bones. In the evening previous to the\r\nLimma, bitter food--the fruits or leaves of the margosa tree (Melia\r\nAzadirachta)--are eaten. They do not like this bitter food, and partake\r\nof it at no other time. [The same custom, called pithapona, or bitter\r\nfood, obtains among the Oriya inhabitants of the plains.] After the\r\nLimma, the Kulba returns to the house of the deceased, but it is\r\nnot supposed to remain there always. The second feast to the dead,\r\nalso sacrificial, is called the Guar. For this, a buffalo, a large\r\nquantity of grain, and all the necessary elements and accompaniments\r\nof a feast are required. It is a much larger affair than the Limma,\r\nand all the relations, and perhaps the villagers, join in. The evening\r\nbefore the Guar, there is a small feast in the house for the purpose\r\nof calling together all the previously deceased members of the family,\r\nto be ready for the Guar on the following day. The great feature of\r\nthe Guar is the erection of a stone in memory of the deceased. From 50\r\nto 100 yards (sometimes a little more) from the houses occupied by a\r\nfamily may be seen clusters of stones standing upright in the ground,\r\nnearly always under a tree. Every one of the stones has been put up\r\nat one of these Guar feasts. There is a great deal of drinking and\r\ndancing. The men, armed with all their weapons, with their feathers\r\nin their hair, and adorned with coloured cloths, accompanied by the\r\nwomen, all dancing as they go, leave the house for the place where\r\nthe stones are. Music always accompanies the dancing. At Kolakotta\r\nthere is another thatched hut for the Kulba at the stones. The stone\r\nis put up in the deceased's name at about 11 A.M., and at about 2\r\nP.M. a buffalo is killed close to it. The head is cut off with an\r\naxe, and blood is put on the stone. The stones one sees are generally\r\nfrom 1 1/2 to 4 feet high. There is no connection between the size\r\nof the stone and the importance of the deceased person. As much of\r\nthe buffalo meat as is required for the feast is cooked, and eaten\r\nat the spot where the stones are. The uneaten remains are taken away\r\nby the relatives. In the evening the people return to the village,\r\ndancing as they go. The Kolakotta people told me they put up the\r\nstones under trees, so that they can have all their feasting in\r\nthe shade. Relations exchange compliments by presenting one another\r\nwith a buffalo for the Guar feast, and receive one in return on a\r\nfuture occasion. The Guar is supposed to give the Kulba considerable\r\nsatisfaction, and it does not injure people as it did before. But, as\r\nthe Guar does not quite satisfy the Kulba, there is the great biennial\r\nfeast to the dead. Every second year (I am still speaking of Kolakotta)\r\nis performed the Karja or biennial feast to the dead, in February\r\nor March, after the crops are cut. All the Kolakotta Saoras join in\r\nthis feast, and keep up drinking and dancing for twelve days. During\r\nthese days, the Kudangs eat only after sunset. Guns are continually\r\nfired off, and the people give themselves up to sensuality. On the\r\nlast day, there is a great slaughter of buffaloes. In front of every\r\nhouse in which there has been a death in the previous two years, at\r\nleast one buffalo, and sometimes two or three, are killed. Last year\r\n(1886) there were said to be at least a thousand buffaloes killed in\r\nKolakotta on the occasion of the Karja. The buffaloes are killed in the\r\nafternoon. Some grain is cooked in the houses, and, with some liquor,\r\nis given to the Kudangs, who go through a performance of offering the\r\nfood to the Kulbas, and a man's or a woman's cloth, according as the\r\ndeceased is a male or female, is at this time given to the Kudang for\r\nthe Kulba of each deceased person, and of course the Kudang keeps the\r\nofferings. The Kudang then tells the Kulba to begone, and trouble the\r\ninmates no more. The house people, too, sometimes say to the Kulba\r\n'We have now done quite enough for you: we have given you buffaloes,\r\nliquor, food, and cloths; now you must go'. At about 8 P.M., the house\r\nis set fire to, and burnt. Every house, in which there has been a death\r\nwithin the last two years, is on this occasion burnt. After this,\r\nthe Kulba gives no more trouble, and does not come to reside in the\r\nnew hut that is built on the site of the burnt one. It never hurts\r\ngrown people, but may cause some infantile diseases, and is easily\r\ndriven away by a small sacrifice. In other parts of the Saora country,\r\nthe funeral rites and ceremonies are somewhat different to what they\r\nare in Kolakotta. The burning of bodies, and burning of the fragments\r\nof the bones, is the same everywhere in the Saora country. In one\r\nvillage the Saoras said the bones were buried until another person\r\ndied, when the first man's bones were dug up and thrown away, and the\r\nlast person's bones put in their place. Perhaps they did not correctly\r\nconvey what they meant. I once saw a gaily ornamented hut, evidently\r\nquite new, near a burning-place. Rude figures of birds and red rags\r\nwere tied to five bamboos, which were sticking up in the air about\r\n8 feet above the hut, one at each corner, and one in the centre,\r\nand the bamboos were split, and notched for ornament. The hut was\r\nabout 4 1/2 feet square, on a platform three feet high. There were\r\nno walls, but only four pillars, one at each corner, and inside\r\na loft just as in a Saora's hut. A very communicative Saora said\r\nhe built the hut for his brother after he had performed the Limma,\r\nand had buried the bones in the raised platform in the centre of the\r\nhut. He readily went inside, and showed what he kept there for the\r\nuse of his dead brother's Kulba. On the loft were baskets of grain,\r\na bottle of oil for his body, a brush to sweep the hut; in fact\r\neverything the Kulba wanted. Generally, where it is the custom to\r\nhave a hut for the Kulba, such hut is furnished with food, tobacco,\r\nand liquor. The Kulba is still a Saora, though a spiritual one. In a\r\nvillage two miles from that in which I saw the gaily ornamented hut,\r\nno hut of any kind is built for the Kulba; the bones are merely covered\r\nwith grass. Weapons, ornaments, etc., are rarely burned with a body\r\noutside the Kolakotta villages. In some places, perhaps one weapon,\r\nor a few ornaments will be burned with it. In some places the Limma\r\nand Guar feasts are combined, and in other places (and this is most\r\ncommon) the Guar and Karja are combined, but there is no burning\r\nof houses. In some places this is performed if crops are good. One\r\noften sees, placed against the upright stones to the dead, pieces\r\nof ploughs for male Kulbas, and baskets for sifting grain for female\r\nKulbas. I once came across some hundreds of Saoras performing the Guar\r\nKarja. Dancing, with music, fantastically dressed, and brandishing\r\ntheir weapons, they returned from putting up the stones to the village,\r\nand proceeded to hack to pieces with their axes the buffaloes that\r\nhad been slaughtered--a disgusting sight. After dark, many of the\r\nfeasters passed my camp on their way home, some carrying legs and other\r\nlarge pieces of the sacrificed buffaloes, others trying to dance in a\r\ndrunken way, swinging their weapons. During my last visit to Kolakotta,\r\nI witnessed a kind of combination of the Limma and Guar (an uncommon\r\narrangement there) made owing to peculiar circumstances. A deceased\r\nSaora left no family, and his relatives thought it advisable to get\r\nthrough his Limma and Guar without delay, so as to run no risk of the\r\nnon-performance of these feasts. He had been dead about a month. The\r\nLimma was performed one day, the feast calling together the deceased\r\nancestors the same evening; and the Guar on the following day. Part of\r\nthe Limma was performed in a house. Three men, and a female Kudang sat\r\nin a row; in front of them there was an inverted pot on the ground,\r\nand around it were small leaf cups containing portions of food. All\r\nchanted together, keeping excellent time. Some food in a little leaf\r\ncup was held near the earthen pot, and now and then, as they sang,\r\npassed round it. Some liquor was poured on the food in the leaf cup,\r\nand put on one side for the Kulba. The men drank liquor from the leaf\r\ncups which had been passed round the earthen pot. After some silence\r\nthere was a long chant, to call together all spirits of ancestors\r\nwho had died violent deaths, and request them to receive the spirit\r\nof the deceased among them; and portions of food and liquor were put\r\naside for them. Then came another long chant, calling on the Kulbas\r\nof all ancestors to come, and receive the deceased and not to be\r\nangry with him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated [154] that, in the east of Gunupur, the Savaras commit\r\nmuch cattle theft, partly, it is said, because custom enjoins big\r\nperiodical sacrifices of cattle to their deceased ancestors. In\r\nconnection with the Guar festival, Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu writes that\r\nwell-to-do individuals offer each one or two animals, while, among\r\nthe poorer members of the community, four or five subscribe small sums\r\nfor the purchase of a buffalo, and a goat. \"There are,\" he continues,\r\n\"special portions of the sacrificed animals, which should, according\r\nto custom, be presented to those that carried the dead bodies to\r\nthe grave, as well as to the Boya and Gomong. If a man is hanged,\r\na string is suspended in the house on the occasion of the Guar, so\r\nthat the spirit may descend along it. If a man dies of wounds caused\r\nby a knife or iron weapon, a piece of iron or an arrow is thrust into\r\na rice-pot to represent the deceased.\" I gather further that, when a\r\nSavara dies after a protracted illness, a pot is suspended by a string\r\nfrom the roof of the house. On the ground is placed a pot, supported on\r\nthree stones. The pots are smeared with turmeric paste, and contain a\r\nbrass box, chillies, rice, onions, and salt. They are regarded as very\r\nsacred, and it is believed that the ancestors sometimes visit them.\r\n\r\nConcerning the religion of the Savaras, Mr. Fawcett notes that their\r\nname for deity is Sonnum or Sunnam, and describes the following:--\r\n\r\n(1) Jalia. In some places thought to be male, and in others female. The\r\nmost widely known, very malevolent, always going about from one Saora\r\nvillage to another causing illness or death; in some places said to eat\r\npeople. Almost every illness that ends in death in three or four days\r\nis attributed to Jalia's malevolence. When mangoes ripen, and before\r\nthey are eaten cooked (though they may be eaten raw), a sacrifice of\r\ngoats, with the usual drinking and dancing, is made to this deity. In\r\nsome villages, in the present year (1887), there were built for\r\nthe first time, temples--square thatched places without walls--in\r\nthe villages. The reason given for building in the villages was that\r\nJalia had come into them. Usually erections are outside villages, and\r\nsacrifice is made there, in order that Jalia may be there appeased, and\r\ngo away. But sometimes he will come to a village, and, if he does, it\r\nis advisable to make him comfortable. One of these newly built temples\r\nwas about four feet square, thatched on the top, with no walls, just\r\nlike the hut for departed spirits. A Saora went inside, and showed\r\nus the articles kept for Jalia's use and amusement. There were two\r\nnew cloths in a bamboo box, two brushes of feathers to be held in the\r\nhand when dancing, oil for the body, a small looking-glass, a bell,\r\nand a lamp. On the posts were some red spots. Goats are killed close\r\nby the temple, and the blood is poured on the floor of the platform\r\nthereof. There are a few villages, in or near which there are no\r\nJalia erections, the people saying that Jalia does not trouble them,\r\nor that they do not know him. In one village where there was none,\r\nthe Saoras said there had been one, but they got tired of Jalia,\r\nand made a large sacrifice with numerous goats and fowls, burnt his\r\ntemple, and drove him out. Jalia is fond of tobacco. Near one village\r\nis an upright stone in front of a little Jalia temple, by a path-side,\r\nfor passers-by to leave the ends of their cheroots on for Jalia.\r\n\r\n(2) Kitung. In some parts there is a story that this deity produced\r\nall the Saoras in Orissa, and brought them with all the animals of\r\nthe jungles to the Saora country. In some places, a stone outside the\r\nvillage represents this deity, and on it sacrifices are made on certain\r\noccasions to appease this deity. The stone is not worshipped. There\r\nare also groves sacred to this deity. The Uriyas in the Saora hills\r\nalso have certain sacred groves, in which the axe is never used.\r\n\r\n(3) Rathu. Gives pains in the neck.\r\n\r\n(4) Dharma Boja, Lankan (above), Ayungang (the sun). The first name is,\r\nI think, of Uriya origin, and the last the real Saora name. There is\r\nan idea in the Kolakotta country that it causes all births. This deity\r\nis not altogether beneficent, and causes sickness, and may be driven\r\naway by sacrifices. In some villages, this deity is almost the only\r\none known. A Saora once told me, on my pointing to Venus and asking\r\nwhat it was, that the stars are the children of the sun and moon, and\r\none day the sun said he would eat them all up. Woman-like, the moon\r\nprotested against the destruction of her progeny, but was obliged to\r\ngive in. She, however, managed to hide Venus while the others were\r\nbeing devoured. Venus was the only planet he knew. In some parts,\r\nthe sun is not a deity.\r\n\r\n(5) Kanni. Very malevolent. Lives in big trees, so they are never\r\ncut in groves which this deity is supposed to haunt. I frequently\r\nsaw a Saora youth of about 20, who was supposed to be possessed by\r\nthis deity. He was an idiot, who had fits. Numerous buffaloes had\r\nbeen sacrificed to Kanni, to induce that deity to leave the youth,\r\nbut to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\"There are many hill deities known in certain localities--Derema,\r\nsupposed to be on the Deodangar hill, the highest in the neighbourhood,\r\nKhistu, Kinchinyung, Ilda, Lobo, Kondho, Balu, Baradong, etc. These\r\ndeities of the hills are little removed from the spirits of the\r\ndeceased Saoras. [Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu refers to two hills, one at\r\nGayaba called Jum-tang Baru, or eat cow hill, and the other about\r\neight miles from Parlakimedi, called Media Baru. At the former, a cow\r\nor bull is sacrificed, because a Kuttung once ate the flesh of a cow\r\nthere; at the latter the spirits require only milk and liquor. This\r\nis peculiar, as the Savaras generally hold milk in abhorrence.]\"\r\n\r\n\"There is invariably one fetish, and generally there are several\r\nfetishes in every Saora house. In some villages, where the sun is the\r\nchief deity (and causes most mischief), there are fetishes of the sun\r\ngod; in another village, fetishes of Jalia, Kitung, etc. I once saw\r\nsix Jalia fetishes, and three other fetishes in one house. There are\r\nalso, especially about Kolakotta, Kulba fetishes in houses. The fetish\r\nis generally an empty earthen pot, about nine inches in diameter,\r\nslung from the roof. The Kudang slings it up. On certain occasions,\r\nofferings are made to the deity or Kulba represented by the fetish\r\non the floor underneath it. Rude pictures, too, are sometimes\r\nfetishes. The fetish to the sun is generally ornamented with a rude\r\npattern daubed in white on the outside. In the village of Bori in the\r\nVizagapatam Agency, offerings are made to the sun fetish when a member\r\nof the household gets pains in the legs or arms, and the fetish is\r\nsaid on such occasion to descend of itself to the floor. Sacrifices\r\nare sometimes made inside houses, under the fetishes, sometimes at\r\nthe door, and blood put on the ground underneath the fetish.\"\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu that \"the Kittungs are ten\r\nin number, and are said to be all brothers. Their names are Bhima,\r\nRama, Jodepulu, Peda, Rung-rung, Tumanna, Garsada, Jaganta, Mutta,\r\nand Tete. On some occasions, ten figures of men, representing the\r\nKittungs, are drawn on the walls of a house. Figures of horses and\r\nelephants, the sun, moon and stars, are also drawn below them. The\r\nBoya is also represented. When a woman is childless, or when her\r\nchildren die frequently, she takes a vow that the Kittungpurpur\r\nceremony shall be celebrated, if a child is born to her, and grows\r\nin a healthy state. If this comes to pass, a young pig is purchased,\r\nand marked for sacrifice. It is fattened, and allowed to grow till\r\nthe child reaches the age of twelve, when the ceremony is performed.\r\n\r\nThe Madras Museum possesses a series of wooden votive offerings\r\nwhich were found stacked in a structure, which has been described to\r\nme as resembling a pigeon-cot. The offerings consisted of a lizard\r\n(Varanus), paroquet, monkey, peacock, human figures, dagger, gun,\r\nsword, pick-axe, and musical horn. The Savaras would not sell them\r\nto the district officer, but parted with them on the understanding\r\nthat they would be worshipped by the Government.\r\n\r\nI gather that, at the sale or transfer of land, the spirits are invoked\r\nby the Boya, and, after the distribution of liquor, the seller or\r\nmortgager holds a pipal (Ficus religiosa) leaf with a lighted wick\r\nin it in his hand, while the purchaser or mortgagee holds another\r\nleaf without a wick. The latter covers the palm of the former with\r\nhis leaf, and the terms of the transaction are then announced.\r\n\r\nConcerning the performance of sacrifices, Mr. Fawcett writes that\r\n\"the Saoras say they never practiced human sacrifice. Most Saora\r\nsacrifices, which are also feasts, are made to appease deities or\r\nKulbas that have done mischief. I will first notice the few which do\r\nnot come in this category. (a) The feast to Jalia when mangoes ripen,\r\nalready mentioned, is one. In a village where the sun, and not Jalia,\r\nis the chief deity, this feast is made to the sun. Jalia does not\r\ntrouble the village, as the Kudung meets him outside it now and\r\nthen, and sends him away by means of a sacrifice. [Sacrifices and\r\nofferings of pigs or fowls, rice, and liquor, are also made at the\r\nmahua, hill grain, and red gram festivals.] (b) A small sacrifice,\r\nor an offering of food, is made in some places before a child is\r\nborn. About Kolakotta, when a child is born, a fowl or a pound or so\r\nof rice, and a quart of liquor provided by the people of the house,\r\nwill be taken by the Kudang to the jungle, and the fowl sacrificed\r\nto Kanni. Blood, liquor, and rice are left in leaf cups for Kanni,\r\nand the rest is eaten. In every paddy field in Kolakotta, when the\r\npaddy is sprouting, a sacrifice is made to Sattira for good crops. A\r\nstick of the tree called in Uriya kendhu, about five or six feet\r\nlong, is stuck in the ground. The upper end is sharpened to a point,\r\non which is impaled a live young pig or a live fowl, and over it an\r\ninverted earthen pot daubed over with white rings. If this sacrifice\r\nis not made, good crops cannot be expected. [It may be noted that\r\nthe impaling of live pigs is practiced in the Telugu country.] [155]\r\nWhen crops ripen, and before the grain is eaten, sacrifice is made\r\nto Lobo (the earth). Lobo Sonnum is the earth deity. If they eat the\r\ngrain without performing this sacrifice, it will disagree with them,\r\nand will not germinate properly when sown again. If crops are good,\r\na goat is killed, if not good, a pig or a fowl. A Kolakotta Saora told\r\nme of another sacrifice, which is partly of a propitiatory nature. If\r\na tiger or panther kills a person, the Kudang is called, and he,\r\non the following Sunday, goes through a performance, to prevent\r\na similar fate overtaking others. Two pigs are killed outside the\r\nvillage, and every man, woman, and child is made to walk over the\r\nground whereon the pig's blood is spilled, and the Kudang gives to\r\neach individual some kind of tiger medicine as a charm. The Kudang\r\ncommunicates with the Kulba of the deceased, and learns the whole\r\nstory of how he met his death. In another part of the Saora country,\r\nthe above sacrifice is unknown; and, when a person is killed by a tiger\r\nor panther, a buffalo is sacrificed to the Kulba of the deceased three\r\nmonths afterwards. The feast is begun before dark, and the buffalo\r\nis killed the next morning. No medicine is used. Of sacrifices after\r\ninjury is felt, and in order to get rid of it, that for rain may be\r\nnoticed first. The Gomango, another important man in the village,\r\nand the Kudang officiate. A pig and a goat are killed outside the\r\nvillage to Kitung. The blood must flow on the stone. Then liquor and\r\ngrain are set forth, and a feast is made. About Kolakotta the belief\r\nin the active malevolence of Kulbas is more noticeable than in other\r\nparts, where deities cause nearly all mischief. Sickness and death are\r\ncaused by deities or Kulbas, and it is the Kudang who ascertains which\r\nparticular spirit is in possession of, or has hold of any sick person,\r\nand informs him what is to be done in order to drive it away. He\r\ndivines in this way usually. He places a small earthen saucer, with\r\na little oil and lighted wick in it, in the patient's hand. With his\r\nleft hand he holds the patient's wrist, and with his right drops from\r\na leaf cup grains of rice on to the flame. As each grain drops, he\r\ncalls out the name of different deities, and Kulbas, and, whichever\r\nspirit is being named as a grain catches fire, is that causing the\r\nsickness. The Kudang is at once in communication with the deity or\r\nKulba, who informs him what must be done for him, what sacrifice made\r\nbefore he will go away. There is, in some parts of the Saora country,\r\nanother method by which a Kudang divines the cause of sickness. He\r\nholds the patient's hand for a quarter of an hour or so, and goes\r\noff in a trance, in which the deity or Kulba causing the sickness\r\ncommunicates with the Kudang, and says what must be done to appease\r\nhim. The Kudang is generally, if not always, fasting when engaged in\r\ndivination. If a deity or Kulba refuses to go away from a sick person,\r\nanother more powerful deity or Kulba can be induced to turn him out.\r\n\r\nA long account of a big sacrifice is given by Mr. Fawcett, of which\r\nthe following is a summary. The Kudang was a lean individual of about\r\n40 or 45, with a grizzled beard a couple of inches in length. He\r\nhad a large bunch of feathers in his hair, and the ordinary Saora\r\nwaist-cloth with a tail before and behind. There were tom-toms with\r\nthe party. A buffalo was tied up in front of the house, and was to be\r\nsacrificed to a deity who had seized on a young boy, and was giving him\r\nfever. The boy's mother came out with some grain, and other necessaries\r\nfor a feed, in a basket on her head. All started, the father of the\r\nboy carrying him, a man dragging the buffalo along, and the Kudang\r\ndriving it from behind. As they started, the Kudang shouted out some\r\ngibberish, apparently addressed to the deity, to whom the sacrifice\r\nwas to be made. The party halted in the shade of some big trees. They\r\nsaid that the sacrifice was to the road god, who would go away by the\r\npath after the sacrifice. Having arrived at the place, the woman set\r\ndown her basket, the men laid down their axes and the tom-toms, and a\r\nfire was lighted. The buffalo was tied up 20 yards off on the path,\r\nand began to graze. After a quarter of an hour, the father took the\r\nboy in his lap as he sat on the path, and the Kudang's assistant sat\r\non his left with a tom-tom before him. The Kudang stood before the\r\nfather on the path, holding a small new earthen pot in his hand. The\r\nassistant beat the tom-tom at the rate of 150 beats to the minute. The\r\nKudang held the earthen pot to his mouth, and, looking up to the sun\r\n(it was 9 A.M.), shouted some gibberish into it, and then danced round\r\nand round without leaving his place, throwing up the pot an inch or so,\r\nand catching it with both hands, in perfect time with the tom-tom,\r\nwhile he chanted gibberish for a quarter of an hour. Occasionally,\r\nhe held the pot up to the sun, as if saluting it, shouted into it, and\r\npassed it round the father's head and then round the boy's head, every\r\nmotion in time with the tom-tom. The chant over, he put down the pot,\r\nand took up a toy-like bow and arrow. The bow was about two feet long,\r\nthrough which was fixed an arrow with a large head, so that it could be\r\npulled only to a certain extent. The arrow was fastened to the string,\r\nso that it could not be detached from the bow. He then stuck a small\r\nwax ball on to the point of the arrow head, and, dancing as before,\r\nwent on with his chant accompanied by the tom-tom. Looking up at\r\nthe sun, he took aim with the bow, and fired the wax ball at it. He\r\nthen fired balls of wax, and afterwards other small balls, which the\r\nUriyas present said were medicine of some kind, at the boy's head,\r\nstomach, and legs. As each ball struck him, he cried. The Kudang,\r\nstill chanting, then went to the buffalo, and fired a wax ball at\r\nits head. He came back to where the father was sitting, and, putting\r\ndown the bow, took up two thin pieces of wood a foot long, an inch\r\nwide, and blackened at the ends. The chant ceased for a few moments\r\nwhile he was changing the bow for the pieces of wood, but, when he\r\nhad them in his hands, he went on again with it, dancing round as\r\nbefore, and striking the two pieces of wood together in time. This\r\nlasted about five minutes, and, in the middle of the dance, he put\r\nan umbrella-like shade on his head. The dance over, he went to the\r\nbuffalo, and stroked it all over with the two pieces of wood, first\r\non the head, then on the body and rump, and the chant ceased. He then\r\nsat in front of the boy, put a handful of common herbs into the earthen\r\npot, and poured some water into it. Chanting, he bathed the boy's head\r\nwith the herbs and water, the father's head, the boy's head again,\r\nand then the buffalo's head, smearing them with the herbs. He blew\r\ninto one ear of the boy, and then into the other. The chant ceased,\r\nand he sat on the path. The boy's father got up, and, carrying the\r\nboy, seated him on the ground. Then, with an axe, which was touched\r\nby the sick boy, he went up to the buffalo, and with a blow almost\r\nburied the head of the axe in the buffalo's neck. He screwed the axe\r\nabout until he disengaged it, and dealt a second and a third blow\r\nin the same place, and the buffalo fell on its side. When it fell,\r\nthe boy's father walked away. As the first blow was given, the Kudang\r\nstarted up very excited as if suddenly much overcome, holding his arms\r\nslightly raised before him, and staggered about. His assistant rushed\r\nat him, and held him round the body, while he struggled violently as\r\nif striving to get to the bleeding buffalo. He continued struggling\r\nwhile the boy's father made his three blows on the buffalo's neck. The\r\nfather brought him some of the blood in a leaf cup, which he greedily\r\ndrank, and was at once quiet. Some water was then given him, and he\r\nseemed to be all right. After a minute or so, he sat on the path with\r\nthe tom-tom before him, and, beating it, chanted as before. The boy's\r\nfather returned to the buffalo, and, with a few more whacks at it,\r\nstopped its struggles. Some two or three men joined him, and,\r\nwith their axes and swords, soon had the buffalo in pieces. All\r\npresent, except the Kudang, had a good feed, during which the tom-tom\r\nceased. After the feed, Kudang went at it again, and kept it up at\r\nintervals for a couple of hours. He once went for 25 minutes at 156\r\nbeats to the minute without ceasing.\r\n\r\nA variant of the ceremonial here described has been given to me by\r\nMr. G. F. Paddison from the Gunapur hills. A buffalo is tied up to\r\nthe door of the house, where the sick person resides. Herbs and rice\r\nin small platters, and a little brass vessel containing toddy, balls\r\nof rice, flowers, and medicine, are brought with a bow and arrow. The\r\narrow is thicker at the basal end than towards the tip. The narrow\r\npart goes, when shot, through a hole in the bow, too small to allow\r\nof passage of the rest of the arrow. The Beju (wise woman) pours toddy\r\nover the herbs and rice, and daubs the sick person over the forehead,\r\nbreasts, stomach, and back. She croons out a long incantation to\r\nthe goddess, stopping at intervals to call out \"Daru,\" to attract\r\nher attention. She then takes the bow and arrow, and shoots into the\r\nair. She then stands behind the kneeling patient, and shoots balls\r\nof medicine stuck on the tip of the arrow at her. The construction\r\nof the arrow is such that the balls are dislodged from the tip of the\r\narrow. The patient is thus shot at all over the body, which is bruised\r\nby the impact of the balls. Afterwards the Beju shoots one or two balls\r\nat the buffalo, which is taken to a path forming the village boundary,\r\nand killed with a tangi (axe). The patient is then daubed with blood\r\nof the buffalo, rice and toddy. A feast concludes the ceremonial.\r\n\r\nThe following account of a sacrifice to Rathu, who had given fever\r\nto the sister of the celebrant Kudang, is given by Mr. Fawcett. \"The\r\nKudang was squatting, facing west, his fingers in his ears, and\r\nchanting gibberish with continued side-shaking of his head. About\r\ntwo feet in front of him was an apparatus made of split bamboo. A\r\nyoung pig had been killed over it, so that the blood was received in a\r\nlittle leaf cup, and sprinkled over the bamboo work. The Kudang never\r\nceased his chant for an hour and a half. While he was chanting, some\r\neight Saoras were cooking the pig with some grain, and having a good\r\nfeed. Between the bamboo structure and the Kudang were three little\r\nleaf cups, containing portions of the food for Rathu. A share of the\r\nfood was kept for the Kudang, who when he had finished his chant,\r\ngot up and ate it. Another performance, for which some dried meat\r\nof a buffalo that had been sacrificed a month previously was used,\r\nI saw on the same day. Three men, a boy, and a baby, were sitting\r\nin the jungle. The men were preparing food, and said that they were\r\nabout to do some reverence to the sun, who had caused fever to some\r\none. Portions of the food were to be set out in leaf cups for the\r\nsun deity.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded by Mr. Ramamurti Pantulu that, when children are\r\nseriously ill and become emaciated, offerings are made to monkeys and\r\nblood-suckers (lizards), not in the belief that illness is caused by\r\nthem, but because the sick child, in its emaciated state, resembles\r\nan attenuated figure of these animals. Accordingly, a blood-sucker\r\nis captured, small toy arrows are tied round its body, and a piece of\r\ncloth is tied on its head. Some drops of liquor are then poured into\r\nits mouth, and it is set at liberty. In negotiating with a monkey,\r\nsome rice and other articles of food are placed in small baskets,\r\ncalled tanurjal, which are suspended from branches of trees in the\r\njungle. The Savaras frequently attend the markets or fairs held\r\nin the plains at the foot of the ghats to purchase salt and other\r\nluxuries. If a Savara is taken ill at the market or on his return\r\nthence, he attributes the illness to a spirit of the market called\r\nBiradi Sonum. The bulls, which carry the goods of the Hindu merchants\r\nto the market, are supposed to convey this spirit. In propitiating\r\nit, the Savara makes an image of a bull in straw, and, taking it\r\nout of his village, leaves it on the foot-path after a pig has been\r\nsacrificed to it.\r\n\r\n\"Each group of Savaras,\" Mr. Ramamurti writes, \"is under the government\r\nof two chiefs, one of whom is the Gomong (or great man) and the other,\r\nhis colleague in council, is the Boya, who not only discharges, in\r\nconjunction with the Gomong, the duties of magistrate, but also holds\r\nthe office of high priest. The offices of these two functionaries are\r\nhereditary, and the rule of primogeniture regulates succession, subject\r\nto the principle that incapable individuals should be excluded. The\r\npresence of these two officers is absolutely necessary on occasions\r\nof marriages and funerals, as well as at harvest festivals. Sales\r\nand mortgages of land and liquor-yielding trees, partition and\r\nother dispositions of property, and divorces are effected in the\r\ncouncil of village elders, presided over by the Gomong and Boya, by\r\nmeans of long and tedious proceedings involving various religious\r\nceremonies. All cases of a civil and criminal nature are heard\r\nand disposed of by them. Fines are imposed as a punishment for all\r\nsorts of offences. These invariably consist of liquor and cattle,\r\nthe quantity of liquor and the number of animals varying according\r\nto the nature of the offence. The murder of a woman is considered\r\nmore heinous than the murder of a man, as woman, being capable of\r\nmultiplying the race, is the more useful. A thief, while in the\r\nact of stealing, may be shot dead. It is always the man, and not\r\nthe woman, that is punished for adultery. Oaths are administered,\r\nand ordeals prescribed. Until forty or fifty years ago, it is said\r\nthat the Savara magistrate had jurisdiction in murder cases. He\r\nwas the highest tribunal in the village, the only arbitrator in\r\nall transactions among the villagers. And, if any differences arose\r\nbetween his men and the inhabitants of a neighbouring village, for\r\nsettling which it was necessary that a battle should be fought, the\r\nGomong became the commander, and, leading his men, contested the cause\r\nwith all his might. These officers, though discharging such onerous\r\nand responsible duties, are regarded as in no special degree superior\r\nto others in social position. They enjoy no special privileges, and\r\nreceive no fees from the suitors who come up to their court. Except\r\non occasions of public festivals, over which they preside, they are\r\ncontent to hold equal rank with the other elders of the village. Each\r\ncultivates his field, and builds his house. His wife brings home fuel\r\nand water, and cooks for his family; his son watches his cattle and\r\ncrops. The English officials and the Bissoyis have, however, accorded\r\nto these Savara officers some distinction. When the Governor's\r\nAgent, during his annual tour, invites the Savara elders to bheti\r\n(visit), they make presents of a fowl, sheep, eggs, or a basket of\r\nrice, and receive cloths, necklaces, etc. The Bissoyis exempt them\r\nfrom personal service, which is demanded from all others.\" At the\r\nSankaranthi festival, the Savaras bring loads of firewood, yams\r\n(Dioscorea tubers), pumpkins, etc., as presents for the Bissoyi,\r\nand receive presents from him in return.\r\n\r\nBesides cultivating, the Savaras collect Bauhinia leaves, and sell\r\nthem to traders for making leaf platters. The leaves of the jel-adda\r\ntree (Bauhinia purpurea) are believed to be particularly appreciated\r\nby the Savara spirits, and offerings made to them should be placed\r\nin cups made thereof. The Savaras also collect various articles of\r\nminor forest produce, honey and wax. They know how to distil liquor\r\nfrom the flowers of the mahua (Bassia latifolia). The process of\r\ndistillation has been thus described. [156] \"The flowers are soaked\r\nin water for three or four days, and are then boiled with water in an\r\nearthenware chatty. Over the top of this is placed another chatty,\r\nmouth downwards, the join between the two being made air-tight by\r\nbeing tied round with a bit of cloth, and luted with clay. From a\r\nhole made in the upper chatty, a hollow bamboo leads to a third pot,\r\nspecially made for the purpose, which is globular, and has no opening\r\nexcept that into which the bamboo pipe leads. This last is kept cool\r\nby pouring water constantly over it, and the distillate is forced\r\ninto it through the bamboo, and there condenses.\"\r\n\r\nIn a report on his tour through the Savara country in 1863, the Agent\r\nto the Governor of Madras reported as follows. \"At Gunapur I heard\r\ngreat complaints of the thievish habits of the Soura tribes on the\r\nhills dividing Gunapur from Pedda Kimedy. They are not dacoits, but\r\nvery expert burglers, if the term can be applied to digging a hole\r\nin the night through a mud wall. If discovered and hard pressed,\r\nthey do not hesitate to discharge their arrows, which they do with\r\nunerring aim, and always with fatal result. Three or four murders\r\nhave been perpetrated by these people in this way since the country\r\nhas been under our management. I arranged with the Superintendent of\r\nPolice to station a party of the Armed Reserve in the ghaut leading\r\nto Soura country. One or two cases of seizure and conviction will\r\nsuffice to put a check to the crime.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that\r\n\"in 1864 trouble occurred with the Savaras. One of their headmen\r\nhaving been improperly arrested by the police of Pottasingi, they\r\neffected a rescue, killed the Inspector and four constables, and\r\nburnt down the station-house. The Raja of Jeypore was requested to use\r\nhis influence to procure the arrest of the offenders, and eventually\r\ntwenty-four were captured, of whom nine were transported for life,\r\nand five were sentenced to death, and hanged at Jalteru, at the foot\r\nof the ghat to Pottasingi. Government presented the Raja with a rifle\r\nand other gifts in acknowledgment of his assistance. The country did\r\nnot immediately calm down, however, and, in 1865, a body of police,\r\nwho were sent to establish a post in the hills, were attacked,\r\nand forced to beat a retreat down the ghat. A large force was then\r\nassembled, and, after a brief but harassing campaign, the post was\r\nfirmly occupied in January, 1866. Three of the ringleaders of this\r\nrising were transported for life. The hill Savaras remained timid\r\nand suspicious for some years afterwards, and, as late as 1874,\r\nthe reports mention it as a notable fact that they were beginning to\r\nfrequent markets on the plains, and that the low-country people no\r\nlonger feared to trust themselves above the ghats.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Government approved the following proposals for the\r\nimprovement of education among the Savaras and other hill tribes in\r\nthe Ganjam and Vizagapatam Agencies, so far as Government schools\r\nare concerned:--\r\n\r\n(1) That instruction to the hill tribes should be given orally\r\nthrough the medium of their own mother tongue, and that, when a Savara\r\nknows both Uriya and Telugu, it would be advantageous to educate him\r\nin Uriya;\r\n\r\n(2) That evening classes be opened whenever possible, the buildings in\r\nwhich they are held being also used for night schools for adults who\r\nshould receive oral instruction, and that magic-lantern exhibitions\r\nmight be arranged for occasionally, to make the classes attractive;\r\n\r\n(3) That concessions, if any, in the matter of grants admissible to\r\nSavaras, Khonds, etc., under the Grant-in-aid Code, be extended to\r\nthe pupils of the above communities that attend schools in the plains;\r\n\r\n(4) That an itinerating agency, who could go round and look after the\r\nwork of the agency schools, be established and that, in the selection\r\nof hill school establishments, preference be given to men educated\r\nin the hill schools;\r\n\r\n(5) That some suitable form of manual occupation be introduced,\r\nwherever possible, into the day's work, and the schools be supplied\r\nwith the requisite tools, and that increased grants be given for\r\nanything original.\r\n\r\nSavara.--A name, denoting hill-men, adopted by Male Kudiyas.\r\n\r\nSavu (death).--A sub-division of Mala.\r\n\r\nSayakkaran.--An occupational term, meaning a dyer, returned, at times\r\nof census, by Tamil dyers.\r\n\r\nSayumpadai Tangi.--The name, meaning supporter of the vanquished army,\r\nof a section of Kallans.\r\n\r\nSedan.--A synonym of Devanga. At times of census, Seda Dasi has been\r\nreturned by Devanga dancing-girls in the Madura district. The following\r\nlegend of Savadamma, the goddess of the weaver caste in Coimbatore, is\r\nnarrated by Bishop Whitehead. [157] \"Once upon a time, when there was\r\nfierce conflict between the men and the rakshasas, the men, who were\r\ngetting defeated, applied for help to the god Siva, who sent his wife\r\nParvati as an avatar or incarnation into the world to help them. The\r\navatar enabled them to defeat the rakshasas, and, as the weaver caste\r\nwere in the forefront of the battle, she became the goddess of the\r\nweavers, and was known in consequence as Savadamman, a corruption of\r\nSedar Amman, Sedan being a title of the weavers. It is said that her\r\noriginal home was in the north of India, near the Himalayas.\"\r\n\r\nSegidi.--The Segidis are a Telugu caste of toddy sellers and distillers\r\nof arrack, who are found mainly in Ganjam and Vizagapatam.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the Madras Abkari Act, toddy means fermented or\r\nunfermented juice drawn from a cocoanut, palmyra, date, or any other\r\nkind of palm-tree. It is laid down, in the Madras Excise Manual, that\r\n\"unfermented toddy is not subject to any taxation, but it must be\r\ndrawn in pots freshly coated internally with lime. Lime is prescribed\r\nas the substance with which the interior of pots or other receptacles\r\nin which sweet toddy is drawn should be coated, as it checks the\r\nfermentation of the toddy coming in contact with it; but this effect\r\ncannot be secured unless the internal lime coating of the toddy pot\r\nor vessel is thorough, and is renewed every time that the pot is\r\nemptied of its contents.\" It is noted by Bishop Caldwell [158] that\r\n\"it is the unfermented juice of the palmyra (and other palms) which\r\nis used as food. When allowed to ferment, which it will do before\r\nmidday, if left to itself, it is changed into a sweet intoxicating\r\ndrink called kal or toddy.\" Pietro Della Valle records [159] that\r\nhe stayed on board till nightfall, \"entertaining with conversation\r\nand drinking tari, a liquor which is drawn from the cocoanut trees,\r\nof a whitish colour, a little turbid, and of a somewhat rough taste,\r\nthough with a blending in sweetness, and not unpalatable, something\r\nlike one of our vini piccanti. It will also intoxicate, like wine,\r\nif drunk over freely.\" Writing in 1673, Fryer [160] describes the\r\nNatives as \"singing and roaring all night long; being drunk with toddy,\r\nthe wine of the Cocoe.\"\r\n\r\nArrack is a spirituous liquor distilled from the fermented sap of\r\nvarious palms. In some parts of the Madras Presidency, arrack vendors\r\nconsider it unlucky to set their measures upside down. Some time ago,\r\nthe Excise Commissioner informs me, the Excise department had some\r\naluminium measures made for measuring arrack in liquor shops. It was\r\nfound that the arrack corroded the aluminium, and the measures soon\r\nleaked. The shopkeepers were told to turn their measures upside down,\r\nin order that they might drain. This they refused to do, as it would\r\nbring bad luck to their shop. New measures with round bottoms were\r\nevolved, which would not stand up. But the shopkeepers began to use\r\nrings of india-rubber from soda-water bottles, to make them stand. An\r\nendeavour has since been made to induce them to keep their measures\r\ninverted by hanging them on pegs, so that they will drain without\r\nbeing turned upside down. The case illustrates well how important a\r\nknowledge of the superstitions of the people is in the administration\r\nof their affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Segidis do not draw the liquor from the palm-tree themselves,\r\nbut purchase it from the toddy-drawing castes, the Yatas and Gamallas.\r\n\r\nThey have a caste headman, called Kulampedda, who settles disputes\r\nwith the assistance of a council. Like other Telugu castes, they have\r\nintiperulu or house names, which are strictly exogamous. Girls are\r\nmarried either before or after puberty. The custom of menarikam is\r\npracticed, in accordance with which a man marries his maternal aunt's\r\ndaughter. A Brahman officiates at marriages, except the remarriage\r\nof widows. When a widow is remarried, the caste-men assemble, and the\r\nKulampedda ties the sathamanam (marriage badge) on the bride's neck.\r\n\r\nThe dead are usually cremated, and the washerman of the village\r\nassists the chief mourner in igniting the pyre. A Satani conducts\r\nthe funeral ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe Segidis worship various village deities, and perantalammas,\r\nor women who killed themselves during their husbands' lives or on\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\nThe more well-to-do members of the caste take the title Anna.\r\n\r\nSekkan (oil-man).--A synonym of Vaniyan.\r\n\r\nSembadavan.--The Sembadavans are the fishermen of the Tamil country,\r\nwho carry on their calling in freshwater tanks (ponds), lakes and\r\nrivers, and never in the sea. Some of them are ferrymen, and the name\r\nhas been derived from sem (good), padavan (boatmen). A legend runs\r\nto the effect that the goddess Ankalamman, whom they worship with\r\nofferings of sheep, pigs, fowls, rice, etc., was a Sembadava girl, of\r\nwhom Siva became enamoured, and Sembadavan is accordingly derived from\r\nSambu (Siva) or a corruption of Sivan padavan (Siva's boatmen). Some\r\nmembers of the caste in the Telugu country returned themselves, at the\r\ncensus, 1901, as Sambuni Reddi or Kapu. According to another legend,\r\nthe name is derived from sembu padavor or copper boatmen. Parvatha\r\nRaja, disguised as a boatman, when sailing in a copper boat, threw\r\nout his net to catch fish. Four Vedas were transformed into nets, with\r\nwhich to catch the rakshasas, who assumed the form of fishes. Within\r\nthe nets a rishi was also caught, and, getting angry, asked the boatman\r\nconcerning his pedigree. On learning it, he cursed him, and ordained\r\nthat his descendants should earn their living by fishing. Hence the\r\nSembadavans call themselves Parvatha Rajavamsam. Yet another legend\r\nstates that the founder of the caste, while worshipping God, was\r\ntried thus. God caused a large fish to appear in the water near the\r\nspot at which he was worshipping. Forgetting all about his prayers,\r\nhe stopped to catch the fish, and was cursed with the occupation\r\nof catching fish for ever. According to yet another account of the\r\norigin of the Sembadavans, Siva was much pleased with their ancestors'\r\ndevotion to him when they lived upon the sea-shore by catching a few\r\nfish with difficulty, and in recognition of their piety furnished them\r\nwith a net, and directed various other castes to become fish-eaters,\r\nso that the Sembadavar might live comfortably.\r\n\r\nOf the Sembadavans of the North Arcot district, Mr. H. A. Stuart\r\nwrites [161] that they \"act as boatmen and fishers. They have little\r\nopportunity of exercising the former profession, but during heavy\r\nfreshes in big rivers they ferry people from bank to bank in round\r\nleather-covered basket coracles, which they push along, swimming\r\nor wading by the side, or assist the timid to ford by holding their\r\nhands. At such times they make considerable hauls. During the rest\r\nof the year they subsist by fishing in the tanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Sembadavans of the South Arcot district,\" Mr. Francis writes,\r\n[162] \"are fresh-water fishermen and boatmen. Both their occupations\r\nbeing of a restricted character, they have now in some cases taken to\r\nagriculture, weaving, and the hawking of salted sea-fish, but almost\r\nall of them are poor. They make their own nets, and, when they have\r\nto walk any distance for any purpose, they often spin the thread\r\nas they go along. Their domestic priests are Panchangi Brahmans,\r\nand these tie the tali at weddings, and perform the purificatory\r\nceremonies on the sixteenth day after deaths.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sembadavans consider themselves to be superior to Pattanavans,\r\nwho are sea-fishermen. They usually take the title Nattan, Kavandan,\r\nManiyakkaran, Paguththar, or Pillai. Some have assumed the title Guha\r\nVellala, to connect themselves with Guha, who rowed the boat of Rama\r\nto Ceylon. At the census, 1901, Savalakkaran (q.v.) was returned as\r\na sub-caste. Savalalai or saval thadi is the flattened paddle for\r\nrowing boats. A large number call themselves Pujari, (priest), and\r\nwear the lingam enclosed in a silver casket or pink cloth, and the\r\nsacred thread. It is the pujari who officiates at the temple services\r\nto village deities. At Malayanur, in the South Arcot district, all\r\nthe Sembadavans call themselves pujari, and seem to belong to a single\r\nsept called Mukkali (three-legged).\r\n\r\nMost of the Sembadavans call themselves Saivites, but a few,\r\ne.g., at Kuppam in North Arcot, and other places, say that they\r\nare Vaishnavites, and belong to Vishnu gotram. Even among those\r\nwho claimed to be Vaishnavites, a few were seen with a sandal paste\r\n(Saivite) mark on the forehead. Their explanation was that they were\r\nreturning from the fields, where they had eaten their food. This they\r\nmust not do without wearing a religious emblem, and they had not with\r\nthem the mirror, red powder, water, etc., necessary for making the\r\nVaishnavite namam mark. They asserted that they never take a girl\r\nin marriage from Saivite families without burning her tongue with a\r\npiece of gold, and purifying her by punyavachanam.\r\n\r\nThe Sembadavans at Chidambaram are all Saivites, and point out\r\nwith pride their connection with the temple. It appears that, on\r\na particular day, they are deputed to carry the idol in procession\r\nthrough the streets, and their services are paid for with a modest\r\nfee and a ball of cooked rice for each person. Some respect is shown\r\nto them by the temple authorities, as the goddess, when being carried\r\nin procession, is detained for some time in their quarters, and they\r\nmake presents of female cloths to the idol.\r\n\r\nThe Sembadavans have exogamous septs, named after various heroes,\r\netc. The office of Nattan or Nattamaikkaran (headman) is confined to\r\na particular sept, and is hereditary. In some places he is assisted\r\nby officers called Sangathikkar or Sangathipillai, through whom,\r\nat a council, the headman should be addressed. At their council\r\nmeetings, representatives of the seven nadus (villages), into which\r\nthe Sembadavans of various localities are divided, are present. At\r\nMalayanur these nadus are replaced by seven exogamous septs, viz.,\r\nDevar, Seppiliyan, Ethinayakan, Sangili, Mayakundali, Pattam,\r\nand Panikkan. If a man under trial pleads not guilty to the charge\r\nbrought against him, he has to bear the expenses of the members of\r\ncouncil. Sometimes, as a punishment, a man is made to carry a basket\r\nof rubbish, with tamarind twigs as the emblem of flogging, and a\r\nknife to denote cutting of the tongue. Women are said to be punished\r\nby having to carry a basket of rubbish and a broom round the village.\r\n\r\nSembadavans who are ferrymen by profession do special worship to\r\nGanga, the goddess of water, to whom pongal (rice) and goats are\r\noffered. It is believed that their immunity from death by drowning,\r\ncaused by the upsetting of their leather coracles, is due to the\r\nprotection of the goddess.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial when a girl reaches puberty corresponds to that\r\nof various other Tamil castes. Meat is forbidden, but eggs are\r\nallowed to be eaten. To ward off devils twigs of Vitex Negundo,\r\nmargosa (Melia Azadirachta), and Eugenia Jambolana are stuck in the\r\nroof. Sometimes a piece of iron is given to the girl to keep. During\r\nthe marriage ceremonies, a branch of Erythrina indica is cut, and\r\ntied, with sprays of the pipal (Ficus religiosa) and a piece of a\r\ngreen bamboo culm, to one of the twelve posts, which support the\r\nmarriage pandal (booth). A number of sumangalis (married women)\r\nbring sand, and spread it on the floor near the marriage dais,\r\nwith pots, two of which are filled with water, over it. The bride\r\nand bridegroom go through a ceremony called sige kazhippu, with the\r\nobject of warding off the evil eye, which consists in pouring a few\r\ndrops of milk on their foreheads from a fig or betel leaf. To their\r\nforeheads are tied small gold or silver plates, called pattam, of\r\nwhich the most conspicuous are those tied by the maternal uncles. The\r\nplate for the bridegroom is V-shaped like a namam, and that for the\r\nbride like a pipal leaf. The bride and bridegroom go through a mock\r\nceremony representative of domestic life, and pot-searching. Seven\r\nrings are dropped into a pot. If the girl picks up three of these, her\r\nfirst-born will be a girl. If the bridegroom picks up five, it will\r\nbe a boy. Married women go in procession to an ant-hill, and bring\r\nto the marriage booth a basket-load of the earth, which they heap up\r\nround the posts. Offerings of balls of rice, cooked vegetables, etc.,\r\nare then made. After the wrist-threads (kankanam) have been removed,\r\nthe bride and bridegroom go to a tank, and go through a mock ploughing\r\nceremony. In some places, the purohits give the bridegroom a sacred\r\nthread, which is finally thrown into a tank or well.\r\n\r\nBy some Sembadavans a ceremony, called muthugunir kuththal (pouring\r\nwater on the back) is performed in the seventh month of pregnancy. The\r\nwoman stands on the marriage dais, and red-coloured water, and lights\r\nare waved. Bending down, she places her hands on two big pots, and\r\nmilk is poured over her back from a betel leaf by all her relations.\r\n\r\nThe Vaishnava Sembadavans burn, and the Saivites bury their dead in a\r\nsitting posture. Fire is carried to the burial-ground by the barber. In\r\ncases of burial the face is covered over by a cloth, in which a slit\r\nis made, so that the top of the head and a portion of the forehead\r\nare exposed. A figure representing Ganesa is made on the head with\r\nashes. All present throw sacred ashes, and a pie (copper coin) into\r\nthe grave, which is then filled in. While this is being done, a bamboo\r\nstick is placed upright on the head of the corpse. On the surface\r\nof the filled-in grave an oblong space is cleared, with the bamboo\r\nin the centre. The bamboo is then removed, and water poured through\r\nthe hole left by it, and a lingam made, and placed over the opening.\r\n\r\nAt Malayanur a ceremony called mayana or smasana kollai (looting the\r\nburning-ground) is performed. The village of Malayanur is famous for\r\nits Ankalamman temple, and, during the festival which takes place\r\nimmediately after the Sivaratri, some thousands of people congregate\r\nat the temple, which is near the burning-ground. In front of the stone\r\nidol is a large ant-hill, on which two copper idols are placed, and\r\na brass vessel, called korakkudai, is placed at the base of the hill,\r\nto receive the various votive offerings. Early in the day, the pujari\r\n(a Sembadavan) goes to a tank, and brings a decorated pot, called\r\npungkaragam, to the temple. Offerings are made to a new pot, and,\r\nafter a sheep has been sacrificed, the pot is filled with water, and\r\ncarried on the head of the pujari, who shows signs of possession by\r\nthe deity, through the streets of the village to the temple, dancing\r\nwildly, and never touching the pot with his hands. It is believed that\r\nthe pot remains on the head, without falling, through the influence\r\nof the goddess. When the temple is reached, another pujari takes up\r\na framework, to which are tied a head made of rice flour, with three\r\nfaces coloured white, black and red, representing the head of Brahma\r\nwhich was cut off by Siva, and a pot with three faces on it. The\r\neyes of the flour figure are represented by hen's eggs. The pot is\r\nplaced beneath the head. Carrying the framework, and accompanied\r\nby music, the pujari goes in procession to the burning-ground, and,\r\nafter offerings of a sheep, arrack, betel and fruits have been made\r\nto the head of Brahma, it is thrown away. Close to the spot where\r\ncorpses are burnt, the pujaris place on the ground five conical heaps\r\n(representing Ganesa), made of the ashes of a corpse. To these are\r\noffered the various articles brought by those who have made vows,\r\nwhich include cooked pulses, bangles, betel, parts of the human body\r\nmodelled in rice flour, etc. The offerings are piled up in a heap,\r\nwhich is said to reach ten or twelve feet in height. Soon afterwards,\r\nthe people assembled fall on the heap, and carry off whatever they\r\ncan secure. Hundreds of persons are said to become possessed, eat the\r\nashes of the corpses, and bite any human bones, which they may come\r\nacross. The ashes and earth are much prized, as they are supposed to\r\ndrive away evil spirits, and secure offspring to barren women. Some\r\npersons make a vow that they will disguise themselves as Siva, for\r\nwhich purpose they smear their faces with ashes, put on a cap decorated\r\nwith feathers of the crow, egret, and peacock, and carry in one hand\r\na brass vessel called Brahma kapalam. Round their waist they tie a\r\nnumber of strings, to which are attached rags and feathers. Instead\r\nof the cap, Paraiyans and Valluvans wear a crown. The brass vessel,\r\ncap, and strings are said to be kept by the pujari, and hired out\r\nfor a rupee or two per head. The festival is said to be based on the\r\nfollowing legend. Siva and Brahma had the same number of faces. During\r\nthe swayamvaram, Parvati, the wife of Siva, found it difficult to\r\nrecognise her husband, so Siva cut off Brahma's head. The head stuck\r\non to Siva's hand, and he could not get rid of it. To get rid of the\r\nskull, and throw off the crime of murder, Siva wandered far and wide,\r\nand came to the burning-ground at Malayanur, where various bhuthas\r\n(devils) were busy eating the remains of corpses. Parvati also arrived\r\nthere, and failed to recognise Siva. Thereon the skull laughed,\r\nand fell to the ground. The bhuthas were so delighted that they put\r\nvarious kinds of herbs into a big vessel, and made of them a sweet\r\nliquor, by drinking which Siva was absolved from his crime. For this\r\nreason arrack is offered to him at the festival. A very similar rite is\r\ncarried out at Walajapet. A huge figure, representing the goddess, is\r\nmade at the burning-ground out of the ashes of burnt bodies mixed with\r\nwater, the eyes being made of hen's eggs painted black in the centre\r\nto represent the pupils. It is covered over with a yellow cloth, and\r\na sweet-smelling powder (kadampam) is sprinkled over it. The following\r\narticles, which are required by a married woman, are placed on it:--a\r\ncomb, pot containing colour-powder, glass bangles, rolls of palm leaf\r\nfor dilating the ear-lobes, and a string of black beads. Devotees\r\npresent as offerings limes, plantains, arrack, toddy, sugar-cane,\r\nand various kinds of cooked grains, and other eatables. The goddess\r\nis taken in procession from her shrine to the burning-ground, and\r\nplaced in front of the figure. The pujari (fisherman), who wears a\r\nspecial dress for the occasion, walks in front of the idol, carrying\r\nin one hand a brass cup representing the skull which Siva carried in\r\nhis hand, and in the other a piece of human skull bone, which he bites\r\nand chews as the procession moves onward. When the burning-ground is\r\nreached, he performs puja by breaking a cocoanut, and going round\r\nthe figure with lighted camphor in his hand. Goats and fowls are\r\nsacrificed. A woman, possessed by a devil, seats herself at the feet\r\nof the figure, and becomes wild and agitated. The puja completed, the\r\nassembled multitude fall on the figure, and carry off whatever they\r\ncan grab of the articles placed on it, which are believed to possess\r\nhealing and other virtues. They also smear their bodies with the\r\nashes. The pujari, and some of the devotees, then become possessed,\r\nand run about the burning-ground, seizing and gnawing partly burnt\r\nbones. Tradition runs to the effect that, in olden times, they used to\r\neat the dead bodies, if they came across any. And the people are so\r\nafraid of their doing this that, if a death should occur, the corpse\r\nis not taken to the burning-ground till the festival is over. \"In\r\nsome cases,\" Herbert Spencer writes, [163] \"parts of the dead are\r\nswallowed by the living, who seek thus to inspire themselves with the\r\ngood qualities of the dead; and we saw that the dead are supposed to\r\nbe honoured by this act.\"\r\n\r\nSembunadu.--The name, meaning the Pandya country, of a sub-division\r\nof Maravan.\r\n\r\nSemmadi.--A Telugu form of Sembadavan.\r\n\r\nSemman.--The Semmans are described, in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1891, as \"an insignificant caste of Tamil leather-workers, found only\r\nin the districts of Madura and Tinnevelly (and in the Pudukottai\r\nState). Though they have returned tailor and lime-burner as their\r\noccupations, the original occupation was undoubtedly leather-work. In\r\nthe Tamil dictionaries Semman is explained as a leather-worker, and\r\na few of them, living in out-of-the way villages, have returned\r\nshoe-making as their occupation. The Semmans are, in fact, a\r\nsub-division of the Paraiyans, and they must have been the original\r\nleather-workers of the Tamil tribes. The immigrant Chakkiliyans have,\r\nhowever, now taken their place.\" The Semmans are described, in the\r\nMadura Manual, as burning and selling lime for building purposes. In\r\nthe Census Report, 1901, the caste is said to have \"two hypergamous\r\nsub-divisions, Tondaman and Tolmestri, and men of the former take\r\nwives from the latter, but men of the latter may not marry girls of\r\nthe former.\"\r\n\r\nGirls are married after puberty, and divorce and remarriage are freely\r\nallowed. As the caste is a polluting one, the members thereof are\r\nnot allowed to use village wells, or enter caste Hindu temples. The\r\ncaste title is Mestri.\r\n\r\nSem Puli (red tiger).--A section of Kallan.\r\n\r\nSenaikkudaiyan.--The Senaikkudaiyans are betel vine (Piper Betel)\r\ncultivators and betel leaf sellers, who are found in large numbers\r\nin the Tinnevelly district, and to a smaller extent in other parts\r\nof the Tamil country. The original name of the caste is said to\r\nhave been Elai (leaf) Vaniyan, for which the more high-sounding\r\nSenaikkudaiyan (owner of an army) or Senaittalavan (chief of an army)\r\nhas been substituted. They also called themselves Kodikkal Pillaimar,\r\nor Pillaimars who cultivate betel gardens, and have adopted the title\r\nPillai. The titles Muppan and Chetti are also borne by members of\r\nthe caste.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that \"the priests of\r\nthe Senaikkudaiyans are Vellalas, and occasionally Brahmans. They do\r\nnot wear the sacred thread. They burn their dead, and perform annual\r\nsraddhas (memorial services). In 1891, following the Tanjore Manual,\r\nthey were wrongly classed with Vaniyans or oil-mongers, but they are\r\nsuperior to these in social position, and are even said to rank above\r\nNattukottai Chettis. Yet it is stated that, in Tanjore, Paraiyans\r\nwill not enter the Senaikkudaiyans' houses to carry away dead cattle,\r\nand ordinary barbers will not serve them, and food prepared by them\r\nwill not be accepted even by barbers or washermen. Somewhat similar\r\nanomalies occur in the case of the Kammalas, and the explanation\r\nmay be that these two castes belonged to the old left-hand faction,\r\nwhile the Pariyans, and the barbers and washermen belonged to the\r\nright-hand. Paraiyans similarly will not eat in the houses of Beri\r\nChettis, who were of the left-hand faction.\"\r\n\r\nSenapati.--A title, denoting commander-in-chief, said to be sold to\r\nKhoduras, and also occurring as a title of other Oriya castes, e.g.,\r\nKurumo and Ronguni. Among the Rongunis, the title is practically an\r\nexogamous sept. Senapati is further a name for Sales (Telugu weavers),\r\nthe headman among whom is called Pedda (big) Senapati. The headman\r\nof the Salapu weavers, who do not intermarry with the Sales, is also\r\nstyled Senapati. It is also a title of the Raja of Sandur.\r\n\r\nSendalai (red-headed man).--Returned as a sub-division of Konga\r\nVellalas at times of census.\r\n\r\nSengundam (red dagger).--A synonym, connected with a caste legend,\r\nof Kaikolan.\r\n\r\nSeniga (Bengal gram: Cicer arietinum).--An exogamous sept of Medara\r\nand Pedakanti Kapu.\r\n\r\nSeniyan.--The name Seniyan is generally used to denote the\r\nKarna Sale weavers, but at Conjeeveram it is applied to Canarese\r\nDevangas. Elsewhere Canarese Devangas belong to the left-hand section,\r\nbut at Conjeeveram they are classed with the right-hand section. Like\r\nother Devangas, the Conjeeveram Seniyans have exogamous house-names\r\nand gotras, which are interesting inasmuch as new names have been, in\r\nrecent times, substituted for the original ones, e.g., Chandrasekhara\r\nrishi, Nilakanta rishi, Markandeya rishi. The Devangas claim Markandeya\r\nas their ancestor. The old house-name Picchi Kaya (water-melon:\r\nCitrullus vulgaris) has been changed to Desimarada, and eating the\r\nmelon is tabu. A list of the house-names and gotras is kept by the\r\nheadman for reference. The Conjeeveram Seniyans are Lingayats, but are\r\nnot so strict as the Canarese Lingayats. Jangams are respected, but\r\nrank after their own stone lingams. In the observance of death rites, a\r\nstaunch Lingayat should not bathe, and must partake of the food offered\r\nto the corpse. These customs are not observed by the Seniyans. Until\r\nquite recently, a man might tie a tali (marriage badge) secretly on\r\na girl's neck, with the consent of the headman and his relatives,\r\nand the girl could then be given in marriage to no other man. This\r\ncustom is said to have been very common, especially in the case of a\r\nman's maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter. At Conjeeveram it\r\nwas extended to girls not so related, and a caste council was held,\r\nat which an agreement was drawn up that the secret tali-tying was\r\nforbidden, and, if performed, was not to be regarded as binding. The\r\npriest of the Conjeeveram Seniyans is a Vellala Pandaram, who is the\r\nhead of the Tirugnana Sambanda Murti mutt (religious institution)\r\nat Conjeeveram.\r\n\r\nServai.--Servai, meaning service, has been recorded as the title of\r\nAgamudaiyans and Valaiyans. Servaikaran or Servaigaran (captain or\r\ncommander) is the title of Agamudaiyan, Ambalakaran, Kallan, Maravan,\r\nand Parivaram. It further occurs as the name for a headman among the\r\nVallambans, and it has been adopted as a false caste name by some\r\ncriminal Koravas in the south.\r\n\r\nServegara.--The Servegaras are a caste found in South Canara, and to\r\na small extent in Bellary. \"They are said to be a branch of the Konkan\r\nMarathis of Goa, from whence they were invited by the Lingayat kings of\r\nNagara to serve as soldiers and to defend their forts (kote), whence\r\nthe alternative name of Koteyava (or Kotegara). Another name for them\r\nis Ramakshatri. The mother-tongue of the Servegaras of South Canara is\r\nCanarese, while their brethren in the north speak Konkani. They have\r\nnow taken to cultivation, but some are employed in the Revenue and\r\nPolice departments as peons (orderlies) and constables, and a few are\r\nshopkeepers. The name Servegara is derived from the Canarese serve, an\r\narmy. In religion they are Hindus, and, like most West Coast castes,\r\nare equally partial to the worship of Siva and Vishnu. They wear\r\nthe sacred thread. Karadi Brahmans are their priests, and they owe\r\nallegiance to the head of the Sringeri mutt. Their girls are married\r\nbefore puberty, and the remarriage of widows is neither allowed nor\r\npracticed. Divorce is permitted only on the ground of the unchastity\r\nof the wife. The body of a child under three years is buried, and that\r\nof any person exceeding that age is cremated. They eat flesh, but do\r\nnot drink. Their titles are Nayak, Aiya, Rao, and Sheregar.\" [164]\r\nIn the Census Report, 1901, Bomman Valekara is returned as a synonym,\r\nand Vilayakara as a sub-caste of Servegara.\r\n\r\nSetti.--See Chetti.\r\n\r\nSettukkaran.--A castle title, meaning economical people, sometimes\r\nused by Devangas instead of Setti or Chetti.\r\n\r\nSevagha Vritti.--A sub-division of Kaikolan.\r\n\r\nSevala (service).--An exogamous sept of Golla.\r\n\r\nShanan.--The great toddy-drawing caste of the Tamil country, which,\r\na few years ago, came into special prominence owing to the Tinnevelly\r\nriots in 1899. \"These were,\" the Inspector-General of Police writes,\r\n[165] \"due to the pretensions of the Shanans to a much higher position\r\nin the religio-social scale than the other castes are willing to\r\nallow. Among other things, they claimed admission to Hindu temples,\r\nand the manager of the Visvanatheswara temple at Sivakasi decided to\r\nclose it. This partial victory of the Shanans was keenly resented by\r\ntheir opponents, of whom the most active were the Maravans. Organised\r\nattacks were made on a number of the Shanan villages; the inhabitants\r\nwere assailed; houses were burnt; and property was looted. The most\r\nserious occurrence was the attack on Sivakasi by a body of over\r\nfive thousand Maravans. Twenty-three murders, 102 dacoities, and\r\nmany cases of arson were registered in connection with the riots in\r\nSivakasi, Chinniapuram, and other places. Of 1,958 persons arrested,\r\n552 were convicted, 7 being sentenced to death. One of the ring-leaders\r\nhurried by train to distant Madras, and made a clever attempt to prove\r\nan alibi by signing his name in the Museum visitor's book. During\r\nthe disturbance some of the Shanans are said to have gone into the\r\nMuhammadan fold. The men shaved their heads, and grew beards; and the\r\nwomen had to make sundry changes in their dress. And, in the case of\r\nboys, the operation of circumcision was performed.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate bone of contention at the time of the Tinnevelly\r\nriots was, the Census Superintendent, 1901, writes, \"the claim of the\r\nShanans to enter the Hindu temples, in spite of the rules in the Agama\r\nShastras that toddy-drawers are not to be allowed into them; but the\r\npretensions of the community date back from 1858, when a riot occurred\r\nin Travancore, because female Christian converts belonging to it gave\r\nup the caste practice of going about without an upper cloth.\" On this\r\npoint Mr. G. T. Mackenzie informs us [166] that \"in the first quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century, the female converts to Christianity in the\r\nextreme south ventured, contrary to the old rules for the lower castes,\r\nto clothe themselves above the waist. This innovation was made the\r\noccasion for threats, violence, and series of disturbances. Similar\r\ndisturbances arose from the same cause nearly thirty years later,\r\nand, in 1859, Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, interfered,\r\nand granted permission to the women of the lower castes to wear a\r\ncloth over the breasts and shoulders. The following proclamation was\r\nissued by the Maharaja of Travancore:--We hereby proclaim that there\r\nis no objection to Shanan women either putting on a jacket like the\r\nChristian Shanan women, or to Shanan women of all creeds dressing in\r\ncoarse cloth, and tying themselves round with it as the Mukkavattigal\r\n(fisherwomen) do, or to their covering their bosoms in any manner\r\nwhatever, but not like women of high castes.\" \"Shortly after 1858,\r\npamphlets began to be written and published by people of the caste,\r\nsetting out their claims to be Kshatriyas. In 1874 they endeavoured\r\nto establish a right to enter the great Minakshi temple at Madura,\r\nbut failed, and they have since claimed to be allowed to wear the\r\nsacred thread, and to have palanquins at their weddings. They say\r\nthey are descended from the Chera, Chola and Pandya kings; they have\r\nstyled themselves Kshatriyas in legal papers; labelled their schools\r\nKshatriya academy; got Brahmans of the less particular kind to do\r\npurohit's work for them; had poems composed on their kingly origin;\r\ngone through a sort of incomplete parody of the ceremony of investiture\r\nwith the sacred thread; talked much but ignorantly of their gotras;\r\nand induced needy persons to sign documents agreeing to carry them\r\nin palanquins on festive occasions.\" [During my stay at Nazareth in\r\nTinnevelly, for the purpose of taking measurements of the Shanans,\r\nI received a visit from some elders of the community from Kuttam,\r\nwho arrived in palanquins, and bearing weapons of old device.] Their\r\nboldest stroke was to aver that the coins commonly known as Shanans'\r\ncash were struck by sovereign ancestors of the caste. The author\r\nof a pamphlet entitled 'Bishop Caldwell and the Tinnevelly Shanars'\r\nstates that he had met with men of all castes who say that they have\r\nseen the true Shanar coin with their own eyes, and that a Eurasian\r\ngentleman from Bangalore testified to his having seen a true Shanar\r\ncoin at Bangalore forty years ago. The coin referred to is the gold\r\nVenetian sequin, which is still found in considerable numbers in the\r\nsouth, and bears the names of the Doges (Paul Rainer, Aloy Mocen,\r\nLudov Manin, etc.) and a cross, which the Natives mistake for a toddy\r\npalm. \"If,\" Mr. Fawcett writes, [167] \"one asks the ordinary Malayali\r\n(native of Malabar) what persons are represented on the sequin, one\r\ngets for answer that they are Rama and Sita: between them a cocoanut\r\ntree. Every Malayali knows what an Amâda is; it is a real or imitation\r\nVenetian sequin. I have never heard any explanation of the word Amâda\r\nin Malabar. The following comes from Tinnevelly. Amâda was the consort\r\nof Bhagavati, and he suddenly appeared one day before a Shanar,\r\nand demanded food. The Shanar said he was a poor man with nothing\r\nto offer but toddy, which he gave in a palmyra leaf. Amâda drank the\r\ntoddy, and performing a mantram (consecrated formula) over the leaf,\r\nit turned into gold coins, which bore on one side the pictures of\r\nAmâda, the Shanar, and the tree, and these he gave to the Shanar as\r\na reward for his willingness to assist him.\"\r\n\r\nIn a petition to myself from certain Shanans of Nazareth, signed by\r\na very large number of the community, and bearing the title \"Short\r\naccount of the Cantras or Tamil Xatras, the original but down-trodden\r\nroyal race of Southern India,\" they write as follows. \"We humbly\r\nbeg to say that we are the descendants of the Pandya or Dravida\r\nXatra race, who, shortly after the universal deluge of Noah, first\r\ndisafforested and colonized this land of South India under the guidance\r\nof Agastya Muni. The whole world was destroyed by flood about B.C. 3100\r\n(Dr. Hale's calculation), when Noah, otherwise called Vaivasvata-manu\r\nor Satyavrata, was saved with his family of seven persons in an\r\nark or covered ship, which rested upon the highest mountain of the\r\nAryavarta country. Hence the whole earth was rapidly replenished by\r\nhis descendants. One of his grandsons (nine great Prajapatis) was\r\nAtri, whose son Candra was the ancestor of the noblest class of the\r\nXatras ranked above the Brahmans, and the first illustrious monarch\r\nof the post-diluvian world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently,\" the Census Superintendent continues, \"judging from the\r\nShanan's own published statements of their case, they rest their\r\nclaims chiefly upon etymological derivations of their caste name\r\nShanan, and of Nadan and Gramani, their two usual titles. Caste\r\ntitles and names are, however, of recent origin, and little can\r\nbe inferred from them, whatever their meaning may be shown to\r\nbe. Brahmans, for example, appear to have borne the titles of\r\nPillai and Mudali, which are now only used by Sudras, and the\r\nNayak kings, on the other hand, called themselves Aiyar, which\r\nis now exclusively the title of Saivite Brahmans. To this day the\r\ncultivating Vellalas, the weaving Kaikolars, and the semi-civilised\r\nhill tribe of the Jatapus use equally the title of Mudali, and the\r\nBalijas and Telagas call themselves Rao, which is properly the title\r\nof Mahratta Brahmans. Regarding the derivation of the words Shanan,\r\nNadan and Gramani, much ingenuity has been exercised. Shanan is not\r\nfound in the earlier Tamil literature at all. In the inscriptions\r\nof Rajaraja Chola (A. D. 984-1013) toddy-drawers are referred to as\r\nIluvans. According to Pingalandai, a dictionary of the 10th or 11th\r\ncentury, the names of the toddy-drawer castes are Palaiyar, Tuvasar,\r\nand Paduvar. To these the Chudamani Nikandu, a Tamil dictionary of\r\nthe 16th century, adds Saundigar. Apparently, therefore, the Sanskrit\r\nword Saundigar must have been introduced (probably by the Brahmans)\r\nbetween the 11th and 16th centuries, and is a Sanskrit rendering of\r\nthe word Iluvan. From Saundigar to Shanan is not a long step in the\r\ncorruption of words. The Shanans say that Shanan is derived from the\r\nTamil word Sanrar or Sanror, which means the learned or the noble. But\r\nit does not appear that the Shanans were ever called Sanrar or Sanror\r\nin any of the Tamil works. The two words Nadan and Gramani mean the\r\nsame thing, namely, ruler of a country or of a village, the former\r\nbeing a Tamil, and the latter a Sanskrit word. Nadan, on the other\r\nhand, means a man who lives in the country, as opposed to Uran, the\r\nman who resides in a village. The title of the caste is Nadan, and\r\nit seems most probable that it refers to the fact that the Iluvan\r\nancestors of the caste lived outside the villages. (South Indian\r\nInscriptions, vol. II, part 1.) But, even if Nadan and Gramani both\r\nmean rulers, it does not give those who bear these titles any claim\r\nto be Kshatriyas. If it did, all the descendants of the many South\r\nIndian Poligars, or petty chiefs, would be Kshatriyas.\"\r\n\r\nThe Census Superintendent, 1891, states that the \"Shanans are in\r\nsocial position usually placed only a little above the Pallas and\r\nthe Paraiyans, and are considered to be one of the polluting castes,\r\nbut of late many of them have put forward a claim to be considered\r\nKshatriyas, and at least 24,000 of them appear as Kshatriyas in the\r\ncaste tables. This is, of course, absurd, as there is no such thing as\r\na Dravidian Kshatriya. But it is by no means certain that the Shanans\r\nwere not at one time a warlike tribe, for we find traces of a military\r\noccupation among several toddy-drawing castes of the south, such\r\nas the Billavas (bowmen), Halepaik (old foot soldiers), Kumarapaik\r\n(junior foot). Even the Kadamba kings of Mysore are said to have\r\nbeen toddy-drawers. 'The Kadamba tree appears to be one of the palms,\r\nfrom which toddy is extracted. Toddy-drawing is the special occupation\r\nof the several primitive tribes spread over the south-west of India,\r\nand bearing different names in various parts. They were employed by\r\nformer rulers as foot-soldiers and bodyguards, being noted for their\r\nfidelity. [168]' The word Shanan is ordinarily derived from Tamil saru,\r\nmeaning toddy; but a learned missionary derives it from san (a span)\r\nand nar (fibre or string), that is the noose, one span in length,\r\nused by the Shanans in climbing palm-trees.\" The latter derivation\r\nis also given by Vellalas.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the Tiyans, or Malabar toddy-drawers,\r\naddress one another, and are addressed by the lower classes as Shener,\r\nwhich is probably another form of Shanar. [169]\r\n\r\nThe whole story of the claims and pretensions of the Shanans is\r\nset out at length in the judgment in the Kamudi temple case (1898)\r\nwhich was heard on appeal before the High Court of Madras. And I may\r\nappropriately quote from the judgment. \"There is no sort of proof,\r\nnothing, we may say, that even suggests a probability that the Shanars\r\nare descendants from the Kshatriya or warrior castes of Hindus,\r\nor from the Pandiya, Chola or Chera race of kings. Nor is there any\r\ndistinction to be drawn between the Nadars and the Shanars. Shanar is\r\nthe general name of the caste, just as Vellala and Maravar designate\r\ncastes. 'Nadar' is a mere title, more or less honorific, assumed by\r\ncertain members or families of the caste, just as Brahmins are called\r\nAiyars, Aiyangars, and Raos. All 'Nadars' are Shanars by caste, unless\r\nindeed they have abandoned caste, as many of them have by becoming\r\nChristians. The Shanars have, as a class, from time immemorial,\r\nbeen devoted to the cultivation of the palmyra palm, and to the\r\ncollection of the juice, and manufacture of liquor from it. There\r\nare no grounds whatever for regarding them as of Aryan origin. Their\r\nworship was a form of demonology, and their position in general social\r\nestimation appears to have been just above that of Pallas, Pariahs,\r\nand Chucklies (Chakkiliyans), who are on all hands regarded as unclean,\r\nand prohibited from the use of the Hindu temples, and below that of\r\nVellalas, Maravans, and other classes admittedly free to worship in\r\nthe Hindu temples. In process of time, many of the Shanars took to\r\ncultivating, trade, and money-lending, and to-day there is a numerous\r\nand prosperous body of Shanars, who have no immediate concern with\r\nthe immemorial calling of their caste. In many villages they own much\r\nof the land, and monopolise the bulk of the trade and wealth. With\r\nthe increase of wealth they have, not unnaturally, sought for social\r\nrecognition, and to be treated on a footing of equality in religious\r\nmatters. The conclusion of the Sub-Judge is that, according to the\r\nAgama Shastras which are received as authoritative by worshippers of\r\nSiva in the Madura district, entry into a temple, where the ritual\r\nprescribed by these Shastras is observed, is prohibited to all those\r\nwhose profession is the manufacture of intoxicating liquor, and the\r\nclimbing of palmyra and cocoanut trees. No argument was addressed to\r\nus to show that this finding is incorrect, and we see no reason to\r\nthink that it is so.... No doubt many of the Shanars have abandoned\r\ntheir hereditary occupation, and have won for themselves by education,\r\nindustry and frugality, respectable positions as traders and merchants,\r\nand even as vakils (law pleaders) and clerks; and it is natural to\r\nfeel sympathy for their efforts to obtain social recognition, and\r\nto rise to what is regarded as a higher form of religious worship;\r\nbut such sympathy will not be increased by unreasonable and unfounded\r\npretensions, and, in the effort to rise, the Shanars must not invade\r\nthe established rights of other castes. They have temples of their own,\r\nand are numerous enough, and strong enough in wealth and education, to\r\nrise along their own lines, and without appropriating the institutions\r\nor infringing the rights of others, and in so doing they will have the\r\nsympathy of all right-minded men, and, if necessary, the protection\r\nof the Courts.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note on the Shanans, the Rev. J. Sharrock writes [170] that they\r\n\"have risen enormously in the social scale by their eagerness for\r\neducation, by their large adoption of the freedom of Christianity,\r\nand by their thrifty habits. Many of them have forced themselves\r\nahead of the Maravars by sheer force of character. They have still\r\nto learn that the progress of a nation, or a caste, does not depend\r\nupon the interpretation of words, or the assumption of a title, but\r\non the character of the individuals that compose it. Evolutions are\r\nhindered rather than advanced by such unwise pretensions resulting\r\nin violence; but evolutions resulting from intellectual and social\r\ndevelopment are quite irresistible, if any caste will continue to\r\nadvance by its own efforts in the path of freedom and progress.\"\r\n\r\nWriting in 1875, Bishop Caldwell remarks [171] that \"the great majority\r\nof the Shanars who remain heathen wear their hair long; and, if they\r\nare not allowed to enter the temples, the restriction to which they\r\nare subject is not owing to their long hair, but to their caste,\r\nfor those few members of the caste, continuing heathens, who have\r\nadopted the kudumi--generally the wealthiest of the caste--are as\r\nmuch precluded from entering the temples as those who retain their\r\nlong hairs. A large majority of the Christian Shanars have adopted\r\nthe kudumi together with Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nBy Regulation XI, 1816, it was enacted that heads of villages have, in\r\ncases of a trivial nature, such as abusive language and inconsiderable\r\nassaults or affrays, power to confine the offending members in the\r\nvillage choultry (lock-up) for a time not exceeding twelve hours;\r\nor, if the offending parties are of the lower castes of the people,\r\non whom it may not be improper to inflict so degrading a punishment,\r\nto order them to be put in the stocks for a time not exceeding six\r\nhours. In a case which came before the High Court it was ruled that\r\nby \"lower castes\" were probably intended those castes which, prior to\r\nthe introduction of British rule, were regarded as servile. In a case\r\nwhich came up on appeal before the High Court in 1903, it was ruled\r\nthat the Shanars belong to the lower classes, who may be punished by\r\nconfinement in the stocks.\r\n\r\nWith the physique of the Shanans, whom I examined at Nazareth and\r\nSawyerpuram in Tinnevelly, and their skill in physical exercises I\r\nwas very much impressed. The programme of sports, which were organised\r\nin my honour, included the following events:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fencing and figure exercises with long sticks of iron-wood\r\n    (Mesua ferrea).\r\n    Figure exercises with sticks bearing flaming rags at each end.\r\n    Various acrobatic tricks.\r\n    Feats with heavy weights, rice-pounders, and pounding stones.\r\n    Long jump.\r\n    Breaking cocoanuts with the thrust of a knife or the closed fist.\r\n    Crunching whiskey-bottle glass with the teeth.\r\n    Running up, and butting against the chest, back, and shoulders.\r\n    Swallowing a long silver chain.\r\n    Cutting a cucumber balanced on a man's neck in two with a sword.\r\n    Falconry.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the good qualities of Sir Thomas Munro, formerly Governor of\r\nMadras, was that, like Rama and Rob Roy, his arms reached to his knees,\r\nor, in other words, he possessed the kingly quality of an Ajanubahu,\r\nwhich is the heritage of kings, or those who have blue blood in\r\nthem. This particular anatomical character I have met with myself\r\nonly once, in a Shanan, whose height was 173 cm. and span of the arms\r\n194 cm. (+ 21 cm.). Rob Roy, it will be remembered, could, without\r\nstooping, tie his garters, which were placed two inches below the knee.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed account of demonolatry among the Shanans, I would refer\r\nthe reader to the Rev. R. (afterwards Bishop) Caldwell's now scarce\r\n'Tinnevelly Shanans' (1849), written when he was a young and impulsive\r\nmissionary, and the publication of which I believe that the learned\r\nand kind-hearted divine lived to regret.\r\n\r\nThose Shanans who are engaged in the palmyra (Borassus flabellifer)\r\nforests in extracting the juice of the palm-tree climb with marvellous\r\nactivity and dexterity. There is a proverb that, if you desire to\r\nclimb trees, you must be born a Shanan. A palmyra climber will,\r\nit has been calculated, go up from forty to fifty trees, each forty\r\nto fifty feet high, three times a day. The story is told by Bishop\r\nCaldwell of a man who was sitting upon a leaf-stalk at the top of a\r\npalmyra palm in a high wind, when the stalk gave way, and he came down\r\nto the ground safely and quietly, sitting on the leaf, which served\r\nthe purpose of a natural parachute. Woodpeckers are called Shanara\r\nkurivi by birdcatchers, because they climb trees like Shanars. \"The\r\nHindus,\" the Rev. (afterwards Canon) A. Margöschis writes, [172]\r\n\"observe a special day at the commencement of the palmyra season,\r\nwhen the jaggery season begins. Bishop Caldwell adopted the custom,\r\nand a solemn service in church was held, when one set of all the\r\nimplements used in the occupation of palmyra-climbing was brought\r\nto the church, and presented at the altar. Only the day was changed\r\nfrom that observed by the Hindus. The perils of the palmyra-climber\r\nare great, and there are many fatal accidents by falling from trees\r\nforty to sixty feet high, so that a religious service of the kind was\r\nparticularly acceptable, and peculiarly appropriate to our people.\" The\r\nconversion of a Hindu into a Christian ceremonial rite, in connection\r\nwith the dedication of ex votos, is not devoid of interest. In a note\r\n[173] on the Pariah caste in Travancore, the Rev. S. Mateer narrates\r\na legend that the Shanans are descended from Adi, the daughter of a\r\nPariah woman at Karuvur, who taught them to climb the palm tree, and\r\nprepared a medicine which would protect them from falling from the high\r\ntrees. The squirrels also ate some of it, and enjoy a similar immunity.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that Shanan\r\ntoddy-drawers \"employ Pallans, Paraiyans, and other low castes to\r\nhelp them transport the liquor, but Musalmans and Brahmans have,\r\nin several cases, sufficiently set aside the scruples enjoined\r\nby their respective faiths against dealings in potent liquor to\r\nown retail shops, and (in the case of some Musalmans at least)\r\nto serve their customers with their own hands.\" In a recent note,\r\n[174] it has been stated that \"L.M.S. Shanar Christians have, in many\r\ncases, given up tapping the palmyra palm for jaggery and toddy as a\r\nprofession beneath them; and their example is spreading, so that a\r\nreal economic impasse is manifesting itself. The writer knows of one\r\nvillage at least, which had to send across the border (of Travancore)\r\ninto Tinnevelly to procure professional tree-tappers. Consequent on\r\nthis want of professional men, the palm trees are being cut down,\r\nand this, if done to any large extent, will impoverish the country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the palmyra forests of Attitondu, in Tinnevelly, I came across a\r\ntroop of stalwart Shanan men and boys, marching out towards sunset,\r\nto guard the ripening cholum crop through the night, each with a\r\ntrained dog, with leash made of fibre passed through a ring on the\r\nneck-collar. The leash would be slipped directly the dog scented a\r\nwild pig, or other nocturnal marauder. Several of the dogs bore the\r\nmarks of encounters with pigs. One of the party carried a musical\r\ninstrument made of a 'bison' horn picked up in the neighbouring jungle.\r\n\r\nThe Shanans have a great objection to being called either Shanan or\r\nMarameri (tree-climber), and much prefer Nadan. By the Shanans of\r\nTinnevelly, whom I visited, the following five sub-divisions were\r\nreturned:--\r\n\r\n1. Karukku-pattayar (those of the sharp sword), which is considered\r\nto be superior to the rest. In the Census Report, 1891, the division\r\nKarukku-mattai (petiole of the palmyra leaf with serrated edges)\r\nwas returned. Some Shanans are said to have assumed the name of\r\nKarukku-mattai Vellalas.\r\n\r\n2. Kalla. Said to be the original servants of the Karukku-pattayar,\r\ndoing menial work in their houses, and serving as palanquin-bearers.\r\n\r\n3. Nattati. Settled at the village of Nattati near Sawyerpuram.\r\n\r\n4. Kodikkal. Derived from kodi, a flag. Standard-bearers of the\r\nfighting men. According to another version, the word means a betel\r\ngarden, in reference to those who were betel cultivators.\r\n\r\n5. Mel-natar (mel, west). Those who live in the western part of\r\nTinnevelly and in Travancore.\r\n\r\nAt the census, 1891, Konga (territorial) and Madurai were returned as\r\nsub-divisions. The latter apparently receives its name, not from the\r\ntown of Madura, but from a word meaning sweet juice. At the census,\r\n1901, Tollakkadan (man with a big hole in his ears) was taken as\r\nbeing a sub-caste of Shanan, as the people who returned it, and sell\r\nhusked rice in Madras, used the title Nadan. Madura and Tinnevelly are\r\neminently the homes of dilated ear-lobes. Some Tamil traders in these\r\ntwo districts, who returned themselves as Pandyan, were classified\r\nas Shanans, as Nadan was entered as their title. In Coimbatore,\r\nsome Shanans, engaged as shop-keepers, have been known to adopt the\r\nname of Chetti. In Coimbatore, too, the title Muppan occurs. This\r\ntitle, meaning headman or elder, is also used by the Ambalakaran,\r\nValayan, Sudarman, Senaikkudaiyan, and other castes. In the Tanjore\r\nManual, the Shanans are divided into Tennam, Panam, and Ichcham,\r\naccording as they tap the cocoanut, palmyra, or wild date (Phoenix\r\nsylvestris). The name Enadi for Shanans is derived from Enadi Nayanar,\r\na Saivite saint. But it also means a barber.\r\n\r\nThe community has, among its members, land-owners, and graduates in\r\ntheology, law, medicine, and the arts. Nine-tenths of the Native clergy\r\nin Tinnevelly are said to be converted Shanans, and Tinnevelly claims\r\nNative missionaries working in Madagascar, Natal, Mauritius, and the\r\nStraits. The occupations of those whom I saw at Nazareth were merchant,\r\ncultivator, teacher, village munsif, organist, cart-driver, and cooly.\r\n\r\nThe Shanans have established a school, called Kshatriya Vidyasala,\r\nat Virudupati in Tinnevelly. This is a free school, for attendance at\r\nwhich no fee is levied on the pupils, for the benefit of the Shanan\r\ncommunity, but boys of other castes are freely admitted to it. It\r\nis maintained by Shanans from their mahimai fund, and the teachers\r\nare Brahmans, Shanans, etc. The word mahimai means greatness, glory,\r\nor respectability.\r\n\r\nShanbog.--The Magane Shanbog takes the place, in South Canara, of the\r\nvillage Karnam or accountant. There are also temple Shanbogs, who are\r\nemployed at the more important temples. When social disputes come up\r\nfor decision at caste council meetings, the Shanbog appointed by the\r\ncaste records the evidence, and the Moktessor or Mukhtesar (chief\r\nman) of the caste decides upon the facts. In some places in South\r\nCanara Shanbog is used as a synonym for Sarasvat Brahman. In Mysore,\r\nthe Shanbog is said [175] to be \"the village accountant, with hardly\r\nan exception of the Brahman caste. The office is hereditary. In\r\nsome places they hold land free of rent, and in others on light\r\nassessment. In some few places a fixed money allowance is given. In\r\nall instances there are certain fixed fees payable to them in money\r\nor kind by the ryots.\"\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. W. Robinson, in a report on the Laccadive islands\r\n(1869), that \"the Monegar has the assistance of one of the islanders\r\nas a Karany, to take down depositions, and to read them, for the\r\ncharacter used is the Arabic. In addition to these duties, the Karany\r\nhas those of the Shanbogue. He keeps the accounts of the trees, and\r\nthe coir (cocoanut fibre) in the islands, and makes out and delivers\r\nthe accounts of coir brought to the coast.\"\r\n\r\nShikari.--Shikari, meaning a sportsman or hunter, occurs as a synonym\r\nof Irula, and a sub-division of Korava. The name shikari is also\r\napplied to a Native who \"accompanies European sportsmen as a guide\r\nand aid, and to the European sportsman himself.\" [176]\r\n\r\nSholaga.--In his account of the Sholagas or Solagas, early in the\r\nlast century, Buchanan [177] writes that they \"speak a bad or old\r\ndialect of the Karnata language, have scarcely any clothing, and sleep\r\nround a fire, lying on a few plantain leaves, and covering themselves\r\nwith others. They live chiefly on the summits of mountains, where\r\nthe tigers do not frequent, but where their naked bodies are exposed\r\nto a disagreeable cold. Their huts are most wretched, and consist of\r\nbamboos with both ends stuck into the ground, so as to form an arch,\r\nwhich is covered with plantain leaves.\" The up-to-date Sholaga, who\r\ninhabits the jungles of Coimbatore between Dimbhum and Kollegal near\r\nthe Mysore frontier, is clad in a cotton loin-cloth, supplemented\r\nby a coat of English pattern with regimental buttons, and smears\r\nhimself freely on special occasions, such as a visit to the Government\r\nanthropologist, with sacred ashes in mimicry of the Lingayats.\r\n\r\nI gather from a correspondent that the following tradition concerning\r\ntheir origin is current. In days of yore there lived two brothers in\r\nthe Geddesala hills, by name Karayan and Billaya or Madheswara. The\r\nUralis and Sholagas are descended from Karayan, and the Sivacharis\r\n(Lingayats) from Madheswara. The two brothers fell into the hands\r\nof a terrible Rakshasha (demon), by name Savanan, who made Karayan\r\na shepherd, but imprisoned Madheswara for not paying him sufficient\r\nrespect, and extracted all kinds of menial work from him. Last of all\r\nhe ordered him to make a pair of shoes, whereupon Madheswara asked\r\nfor his liberty for a few days, to enable him to have the shoes well\r\nmade. His request being granted, Madheswara betook himself to the\r\ngod Krishnamurti, and asked him for his help in his troubles. The\r\ngod was only too happy to assist, and suggested that the shoes\r\nshould be made of wax. Helped by Krishnamurti, Madheswara made a very\r\nbeautiful-looking pair of shoes. Krishnamurti then ordered him to pile\r\nup and light a huge bonfire on a bare rocky hill east of Geddesala,\r\nso as to make it nearly red-hot. The ashes were then cleared away, so\r\nas to leave no trace of their plot. Madheswara then took the shoes,\r\nand presented them to Savanan, who was much pleased with them, and\r\nwillingly acceded to Madheswara's request that he would put them on,\r\nand walk along the rock. But, as soon as he stepped upon it, the\r\nshoes melted, and Savanan fell heavily on the rock, clutching hold\r\nof Madheswara as he fell, and trying to strangle him. Krishnamurti\r\nhad assembled all the gods to witness the carrying out of the plot,\r\nand, telling each of them to pile a stone on Savanan's head, himself\r\nrescued Madheswara from his clutches, and all jumped upon the Rakshasha\r\ntill no trace of him was left. While this was going on, Karayan was\r\ntending Savanan's herds in the forest, and, when he came to hear\r\nabout it, was angry with his brother for not consulting him before\r\ndestroying Savanan. Flying from Karayan, who was armed with a knife,\r\nMadheswara implored Krishnamurti's help, by which he was able to leap\r\nfrom Kotriboli to the hill called Urugamalai, a distance of some ten\r\nmiles. The force of the leap caused the hill to bend--hence its name\r\nmeaning the bending hill. Finding that the hill was bending, and being\r\nstill hotly pursued by his brother, knife in hand, Madheswara again\r\nappealed to Krishnamurti, and was enabled to make another leap of about\r\nfive miles to a hill called Eggaraimalai, which immediately began to\r\nsubside. Hence its name, meaning the subsiding hill. Thence he fled\r\nto Munikanal, and concealed himself under a rock, closely followed\r\nby Karayan, who slashed the rock with his knife, and left marks which\r\nare visible to this day. From Munikanal he fled to the hill now known\r\nas Madheswaranamalai, and hid in a rat hole. Karayan, not being able\r\nto unearth him, sent for a lot of shepherds, and made them pen their\r\nsheep and cattle over the hole. The effluvium became too strong for\r\nthe fugitive, so he surrendered himself to his brother, who pardoned\r\nhim on the understanding that, on deification, Karayan should have\r\nprior claim to all votive offerings. To this Madheswara agreed, and\r\nto this day Sivacharis, when doing puja, first make their offerings to\r\nKarayan and afterwards to Madheswara. In connection with this legend,\r\nany one proceeding to the top of Kotriboli hill at the present day is\r\nexpected to place a stone upon the rock, with the result that there\r\nare many piles of stones there. Even Europeans are asked to do this.\r\n\r\nThe Sholagas are said to call themselves men of five kulams,\r\nor exogamous septs, among which are Chalikiri, Teneru, Belleri,\r\nSurya (the sun), and Aleru. By members of the twelve kulam class,\r\neverything is done by twelves. For example, on the twelfth day after a\r\nbirth, twelve elders are invited to the house to bless the child. At\r\na marriage, twelve of the bridegroom's relations go and fetch the\r\nbride, and the wedding pandal (booth) has twelve posts. The parents\r\nof the bridegroom pay twelve rupees to the bride's father, and a tali\r\n(marriage badge) worth twelve annas is tied round the bride's neck. In\r\ncase of death, the body is borne on a stretcher made of twelve bamboos,\r\nand mourning lasts for twelve days.\r\n\r\nTribal disputes, e.g., quarrelling and adultery, are decided by\r\nthe Yejamana, assisted by a Pattagara and a few leading men of the\r\ncommunity. Under the orders of the two former is the Chalavathi or\r\nvillage servant. The Yejamana, Pattagara, and Chalavathi must belong\r\nrespectively to the Chalikiri, Teneri, and Surya septs.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl reaches puberty, she occupies a separate hut for five days,\r\nand then returns home after a bath. The maternal uncle should present\r\nher with a new cloth, betel leaves and areca nuts, and plantain\r\nfruits. In the formal marriage ceremony, the tali is tied by the\r\nbridegroom inside a booth; the maternal uncle, if he can afford it,\r\npresents a new cloth to the bride, and a feast is held. Sometimes\r\neven this simple rite is dispensed with, and the couple, without any\r\nformality, live together as man and wife, on the understanding that, at\r\nsome time, a feast must be given to a few of the community. I am told\r\nthat the Sholagas of the Burghur hills have a very extraordinary way\r\nof treating expectant mothers. A few days before the event is expected\r\nto take place, the husband takes his wife right away into the jungle,\r\nand leaves her there alone with three days' supply of food. There\r\nshe has to stay, and do the best she can for herself. If she does not\r\ncome back at the end of the three days, the husband goes out and takes\r\nher more food. But she may not return to her village till the baby is\r\nborn. When one of these unfortunate creatures comes back safely, there\r\nis a great celebration in her honour, with beating of tom-tom, etc.\r\n\r\nThe dead are buried with the body lying on its left side, and the\r\nhead to the south. On their return home from a funeral, those who\r\nhave been present thereat salute a lighted lamp. On the spot where\r\nthe dead person breathed his last, a little ragi (Eleusine Coracana)\r\npaste and water are placed, and here, on the fourth day, a goat is\r\nsacrificed, and offered up to the soul of the departed. After this\r\nthe son proceeds to the burial ground, carrying a stone, and followed\r\nby men selected from each of the exogamous septs. Arrived near the\r\ngrave, they sit down, while the son places the stone on the ground,\r\nand they then lift it in succession. The last man to do so is said\r\nto fall into a trance. On his recovery, leaves (plantain, teak,\r\netc.) corresponding in number to the exogamous septs, are arranged\r\nround the stone, and, on each leaf, different kinds of food are\r\nplaced. The men partake of the food, each from the leaf allotted to\r\nhis sept. The meal concluded, the son holds the stone in his hands,\r\nwhile his companions pour ragi and water over it, and then carries it\r\naway to the gopamane (burial-ground) of his sept, and sets it up there.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a death in a Mala Vellala village, the Sholagas\r\ncome in crowds, with clarionets and drums, and bells on their legs,\r\nand dance in front of the house. And the corpse is borne, in musical\r\nprocession, to the burning-ground.\r\n\r\nThe staple food of the Sholagas is ragi paste and yams (Dioscorea),\r\nwhich, like the Uralis, they supplement by sundry jungle animals\r\nand birds. Paroquets they will not eat, as they regard them as their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nTheir main occupation is to collect minor forest produce, myrabolams,\r\nvembadam bark (Ventilago madraspatana), avaram bark (Cassia\r\nauriculata), deers' horns, tamarinds, gum, honey, soap-nuts, sheekoy\r\n(Acacia Concinna),etc. The forests have been divided into blocks,\r\nand a certain place within each block has been selected for the\r\nforest depôt. To this place the collecting agents, mostly Sholagas\r\nand Uralis, bring the produce, and there it is sorted and paid for\r\nby special supervisors appointed for the work.\r\n\r\nIn the Coimbatore district the Sholagas are said to collect honey\r\nfrom rocky crevices. The combs are much larger than those found on\r\ntrees, and are supposed to contain twice as much wax in proportion\r\nto the honey. On the Nilgiri hills honey-combs are collected by Jen\r\nKurumbas and Sholagas. The supply of honey varies according to the\r\nnature of the season, and is especially plentiful and of good quality\r\nwhen Strobilanthes Wightianus, S. Kunthiana, and other species are\r\nin flower.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that even wild beasts will scent a Sholaga, and flee\r\nbefore the aroma.\r\n\r\nThe Sholagas, who were examined by Dr. Rivers and myself, came to the\r\nconclusion that the object of our enquiry was to settle them in a\r\ncertain place near London, and that the wools of different colours\r\n(used for testing colour vision) given to them for selection,\r\nwere for tying them captive with. Others said that they could not\r\nunderstand why the different organs of their bodies were measured;\r\nperhaps to reduce or increase the size of their body to suit the\r\ndifferent works, which they were expected to do near London. It has\r\nbeen pointed out to me, as an interesting fact, that a similarity\r\nof idea concerning the modification of different organs to suit men\r\nfor the doing of special work has been arrived at by the jungle folk,\r\nand by Mr. Wells in his book, 'The first men in the moon,' where the\r\nlunar inhabitants are described as carrying on the practice.\r\n\r\nOf the experiences of a Sholaga when out with a European on a shooting\r\nexpedition, the following account has recently been given. [178]\r\n\"My husband was after a bear, and tracked Bruin to his cave. He had\r\ntorches made, and these he ordered to be thrust into the cave in the\r\nhope of smoking the bear out, but, as nothing happened, he went into\r\nthe cave, accompanied by a Sholigar carrying a torch. As soon as they\r\ngot used to the light, they saw a small aperture leading into an inner\r\ncave, and the Sholigar was told to put the torch in there. Hardly was\r\nthis done, when out rushed a large bear, knocking over the Sholigar,\r\nand extinguishing the torch. My husband could not get his gun up in\r\ntime to fire, as the bear rushed through the cave into the jungle. Just\r\nas the Sholigar was picking himself up, out rushed another bear. This\r\ntime my husband was ready, and fired. To the Sholigar's horror, Bruin\r\nsank down wounded at the entrance to the outer cave, thus blocking the\r\nexit, and keeping both tracker and my husband prisoners. The Sholigar\r\nbegan whimpering, saying he was the father of a large family, and\r\ndid not wish to leave the children fatherless. Soon the bear, though\r\nvery badly wounded, managed to get to its feet, and crawl away into\r\nthe jungle, so liberating the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the Sholagas of the Mysore Province, [179] I gather\r\nthat they \"inhabit the depths of the forests clothing the foot and\r\nslopes of the Biligirirangam hills. They cultivate with the hoe small\r\npatches of jungle clearings. Their chief god is Biligiri Rangasvami,\r\nbut they also worship Karaiyya, their tribal tutelary deity. Their\r\nprincipal food is the ragi, which they grow, supplemented by wild\r\nforest produce. They are partial to the flesh of deer, antelope,\r\npigs, sheep and goats. A few of them have, in recent years, come to\r\nown lands. Like the Jenu Kurumbas, they are perfect trackers of wild\r\nanimals. Three kinds of marriage prevail among them. The first is\r\naffected by the more well-to-do, who perform the ceremony with much\r\néclat under a shed with twelve pillars (bamboo posts), accompanied\r\nby music and festivities, which continue for three days. The second\r\nis more common, and seems to be a modified form of concubinage. The\r\npoorer members resort to the third kind, which consists in the couple\r\neloping to a distant jungle, and returning home only after the bride\r\nhas become a mother. They speak a patois, allied to old Canarese or\r\nHale Kannada.\" [180]\r\n\r\nShola Naiker.--A synonym of Jen Kurumbas in the Wynad.\r\n\r\nSibbi Dhompti (brass vessel offering).--A subdivision of Madigas,\r\nwho, at marriages, offer food to the god in brass vessels.\r\n\r\nSiddaru.--A synonym of Jogi mendicants.\r\n\r\nSika (kudumi or hair-knot).--An exogamous sept of Devanga.\r\n\r\nSikili (broom).--An exogamous sept of Madiga.\r\n\r\nSikligar.--In the Madras Census Report, 1901, eleven individuals\r\nare returned as belonging to an Upper India caste of knife-grinders\r\n(Sikligar). In the Madura Manual, Sikilkarars are described as\r\nknife-grinders, who wander about in quest of work from village\r\nto village.\r\n\r\nSila (stone).--An exogamous sept of Omanaito.\r\n\r\nSilam (good conduct).--An exogamous sept of Mala.\r\n\r\nSilavant.--In the Madras Census Report, 1901, Silavant is recorded\r\nas meaning the virtuous, and as being a sub-sect of Lingayats. In\r\nthe Mysore Census Report, Silavanta is given as a name for Lingayat\r\nNayindas. For the following note on the Silavantalu or Silevantalu\r\nof Vizagapatam, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.\r\n\r\nThey are a sect of Lingayats, who, though they do not admit it, appear\r\nto be an offshoot of Pattu Sales, who became converts to the Lingayat\r\nreligion. They are engaged in the manufacture of fine cloths for males\r\nand females. The religious observances which secured them their name,\r\nmeaning those who practice or possess particular religious customs,\r\nhave been thus described. In the seventh month of pregnancy, at the\r\ntime of quickening, a small stone linga is enclosed in black lac,\r\nwrapped in a piece of silk cloth, and tied to the thread of the linga\r\nwhich is on the woman's neck. The child is thus invested with the\r\nlinga while still in utero. When it is about a year old, and weaned,\r\nthe linga is taken off the mother's neck, and replaced by a silver\r\nlocket. The linga is tied on the neck of the child. At the beginning\r\nof the twelfth year in the case of boys, and just before the marriage\r\nof girls, this linga is taken off, and a fresh one suspended round\r\nthe neck by a guru.\r\n\r\nThe Silavantalu are divided into exogamous septs, or intiperulu. The\r\ncustom of menarikam, whereby a man marries his maternal uncle's\r\ndaughter, is the rule. But, if the maternal uncle has no daughter,\r\nhe must find a suitable bride for his nephew. Girls are married before\r\npuberty, and a Jangam, known as Mahesvara, officiates at weddings.\r\n\r\nThe dead are buried in a sitting posture, facing north. The linga is\r\nsuspended round the neck of the corpse, and buried with it. Six small\r\ncopper plates are made, each containing a syllable of the invocation\r\nOm na ma Si va ya. Two of these are placed on the thighs of the corpse,\r\none on the head, one on the navel, and two on the shoulders, and stuck\r\non with guggilam paste. The corpse is then tied up in a sack. The\r\nrelatives offer flowers to it, and burn camphor before it. The grave\r\nis dug several feet deep, and a cavity or cell is made on the southern\r\nside of it, and lined with bamboo matting. The corpse is placed within\r\nthe cell, and salt thrown into the grave before it is filled in. A\r\nJangam officiates at the funeral. Monthly and annual death ceremonies\r\nare performed. A samathi or monument is erected over the grave. Such\r\na monument may be either in the form of a square mound (brindavan)\r\nwith niches for lights and a hole in the top, in which a tulsi (Ocimum\r\nsanctum) is planted, or in the form of a small chamber. Relations go\r\noccasionally to the grave, whereon they deposit flowers, and place\r\nlights in the niches or chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Silavantalu are strict vegetarians and total abstainers. Their\r\ntitles are Ayya and Lingam.\r\n\r\nSilpa (artisan).--A sub-division of the Kammalans, Panchalas or\r\nKamsalas, whose hereditary occupation is that of stone-masons. In the\r\nSilpa Sastra, the measurements necessary in sculpture, the duties\r\nof a Silpi, etc., are laid down. I am informed that the carver of\r\na stone idol has to select a male or female stone, according as the\r\nidol is to be a god or goddess, and that the sex of a stone can be\r\ndetermined by its ring when struck.\r\n\r\nSindhu.--The Sindhuvallu (drummers) are Madigas, who go about\r\nacting scenes from the Ramayana or Mahabharatha, and the story of\r\nAnkamma. Sindhu also occurs as a gotra of Kurni. The beating of\r\nthe drum called sindhu is, I gather, sometimes a nuisance, for a\r\nmissionary writes to the paper enquiring whether there is any order\r\nof Government against it, as the practice \"causes much crime, and\r\ncreates extra work for police and magistrates. Village officials\r\nbelieve they have no authority to suppress it, but there are some\r\nwho assert that it is nominally forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nSingamu-varu.--Singam is described, in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1901, as a class of beggars, who beg only from Sales. They are,\r\nhowever, described by Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao as a class of itinerant\r\nmendicants attached to the Devangas. \"The name,\" he writes, \"is\r\na variant of Simhamu-varu, or lion-men, i.e., as valourous as a\r\nlion. They are paid a small sum annually by each Devanga village\r\nfor various services which they render, such as carrying fire before\r\na Devanga corpse to the burial-ground, acting as caste messengers,\r\nand cleaning the weaving instruments.\"\r\n\r\nSinnata (gold).--An exogamous sept of Kuruba.\r\n\r\nSiolo.--A small class of Oriya toddy-drawers, whose touch conveys\r\npollution. The Sondis, who are an Oriya caste of toddy-sellers,\r\npurchase their liquor from the Siolos.\r\n\r\nSipiti.--The Sipitis are described, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,\r\nas \"Oriya temple priests and drummers; a sub-caste of Ravulo.\" In\r\nan account of them as given to me, they are stated to be Smartas,\r\nand temple priests of village deities, who wear the sacred thread,\r\nbut do not employ Brahmans as purohits, and are regarded as somewhat\r\nlower in the social scale than the Ravulos. Some of their females are\r\nsaid to have been unrecognised prostitutes, but the custom is dying\r\nout. The caste title is Muni. (See Ravulo.)\r\n\r\nSir.--A sub-division of Kanakkan.\r\n\r\nSirpadam.--A sub-division of Kaikolan.\r\n\r\nSirukudi.--A nadu or territorial division of Kallan.\r\n\r\nSiru Tali.--The name, indicating those who wear a small tali (marriage\r\nbadge), of a sub-division of Kaikolan and Maravan.\r\n\r\nSitikan.--Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report, 1901, as an\r\noccupational sub-division of Maran.\r\n\r\nSitra.--See Pano.\r\n\r\nSiva Brahmana.--Recorded as a synonym of Stanika.\r\n\r\nSivachara.--It is noted, in the Mysore Census Report, 1901,\r\nthat the Lingayats call themselves \"Vira Saivas, Sivabhaktas, or\r\nSivachars. The Virasaiva religion consists of numerous castes. It\r\nis a religion consisting of representatives from almost every caste\r\nin Hindu society. People of all castes, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, have embraced the religion. There are Sivachar Brahmins,\r\nSivachar Kshatriyas, Sivachar Vaisyas, Sivachar carpenters, Sivachar\r\nweavers, Sivachar goldsmiths, Sivachar potters, Sivachar washermen,\r\nand Sivachar barbers, and other low castes who have all followed the\r\npopular religion in large numbers.\"\r\n\r\nSivadvija.--The name, denoting Saivite Brahman, by which Mussads like\r\nto be called. Also recorded as a synonym of Stanika.\r\n\r\nSivaratri.--An exogamous sept of Odde, named after the annual\r\nMahasivaratri festival in honour of Siva. Holy ashes, sacred to Siva,\r\nprepared by Smartas on this day, are considered to be very pure.\r\n\r\nSivarchaka.--The word means those who do puja (worship) to\r\nSiva. Priests at the temple of village deities are ordinarily known\r\nas Pujari, Pusali, Occhan, etc., but nowadays prefer the title of\r\nUmarchaka or Sivarchaka. The name Sivala occurs in the Madras Census\r\nReport, 1901.\r\n\r\nSiviyar.--Siviyar means literally a palanquin-bearer, and is an\r\noccupational name applied to those employed in that capacity. For this\r\nreason a sub-division of the Idaiyans is called Siviyar. The Siviyars\r\nof Coimbatore say that they have no connection with either Idaiyans or\r\nToreyas, but are Besthas who emigrated from Mysore during the troublous\r\ntimes of the Muhammadan usurpation. The name Siviyar is stated to have\r\nbeen given to them by the Tamils, as they were palanquin-bearers to\r\nofficers on circuit and others in the pre-railway days. They claim\r\norigin, on the authority of a book called Parvatharaja Charithum,\r\nfrom Parvatharaja. Their main occupations at the present day are tank\r\nand river fishing, but some are petty traders, physicians, peons,\r\netc. Their language is Canarese, and their title Naickan. They have\r\neighteen marriage divisions or gotras, named after persons from whom\r\nthe various gotras are said to have been descended. On occasions\r\nof marriage, when betel leaf is distributed, it must be given to\r\nmembers of the different gotras in their order of precedence. In\r\ncases of adultery, the guilty parties are tied to a post, and beaten\r\nwith tamarind switches. When a grown-up but unmarried person dies,\r\nthe corpse is made to go through a mock marriage with a human figure\r\ncut out of a palm leaf.\r\n\r\nSodabisiya.--A sub-division of Domb.\r\n\r\nSoi.--A title of Doluva. It is a form of Sui or Swayi.\r\n\r\nSolaga.--See Sholaga.\r\n\r\nSoliyan.--Soliyan or Soliya is a territorial name, meaning an\r\ninhabitant of the Chola country, recorded as a sub-division of Karnam,\r\nIdaiyan, Pallan, and Vellala. The equivalent Solangal occurs as an\r\nexogamous sept of Vallamban, and Soliya illam (Malayalam, house)\r\nas an exogamous sept of Panikkans in the Tamil country. Some Pallis\r\nstyle themselves Solakanar (descendants of Chola kings), or Solakula\r\nKshatriya. (See Sozhia.)\r\n\r\nSomakshatri.--A name sometimes adopted by Canarese Ganigas in South\r\nCanara.\r\n\r\nSomara.--Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as a small\r\nclass of potters in the Vizagapatam hills.\r\n\r\nSomari (idler).--A division of Yanadis, who do scavenging work, and eat\r\nthe refuse food thrown away by people from the leaf plate after a meal.\r\n\r\nSoma Varada (Sunday).--The name of Kurubas who worship their god\r\non Sundays.\r\n\r\nSonagan.--See Jonagan.\r\n\r\nSonar.--The Sonars or Sonagaras of South Canara are described by\r\nMr. H. A. Stuart [181] as a goldsmith caste, who \"speak Konkani, which\r\nis a dialect of Marathi, and are believed to have come from Goa. The\r\ncommunity at each station has one or two Mukhtesars or headmen,\r\nwho enquire into, and settle the caste affairs. Serious offences are\r\nreported to the swamy of Sode, who has authority to excommunicate, or\r\nto inflict heavy fines. They wear the sacred thread. Marriages within\r\nthe same gotra are strictly prohibited. Most of them are Vaishnavites,\r\nbut a few follow Siva. The dead are burned, and the ashes are thrown\r\ninto a river. They eat fish, but not flesh. Their title is Setti.\" They\r\nconsider it derogatory to work in metals other than gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Census Report, 1901, the Sunnari (or Sonnari) are\r\ndescribed as Oriya goldsmiths (see Risley, Tribes and Castes of\r\nBengal, Sonar). These goldsmiths, in the Oriya portion of the\r\nMadras Presidency, are, I am informed, Kamsalas from the Telugu\r\ncountry. Unlike the Oriyas, and like other Telugu classes, they\r\ninvariably have a house-name, and their mother tongue is Telugu. They\r\nare Saivites, bury their dead, claim to be descendants of Viswakarma,\r\nand call themselves Viswa Brahmans. They do not eat meals prepared\r\nby Brahmans, or drink water at the hands of Brahmans.\r\n\r\nIn former times, goldsmiths held the post of Nottakaran (tester) or\r\nvillage shroff (money-changer). His function was to test the rupees\r\ntendered when the land revenue was being gathered in, and see that\r\nthey were not counterfeit. There is a proverb, uncomplimentary to the\r\ngoldsmiths, to the effect that a goldsmith cannot make an ornament\r\neven for his wife, without first secreting some of the gold or silver\r\ngiven him for working upon.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted [182] that \"in Madras, an exceedingly poor country,\r\nthere is one male goldsmith to every 408 of the total population; in\r\nEngland, a very rich country, there is only one goldsmith to every\r\n1,200 inhabitants. In Europe, jewellery is primarily for ornament,\r\nand is a luxury. In India it is primarily an investment, its ornamental\r\npurpose being an incident.\"\r\n\r\nThe South Indian goldsmith at work has been well described as\r\nfollows. [183] \"A hollow, scooped out in the middle of the mud\r\nfloor (of a room or verandah), does duty for the fireplace, while,\r\nclose by, there is raised a miniature embankment, semi-circular in\r\nshape, with a hole in the middle of the base for the insertion of\r\nthe bellows. Crucibles of clay or cow-dung, baked hard in the sun,\r\ntongs and hammers, potsherds of charcoal, dirty tins of water, and\r\nlittle packets of sal-ammoniac, resin, or other similar substances,\r\nall lie scattered about the floor in picturesque confusion. Sitting,\r\nor rather crouching on their haunches, are a couple of the Panchala\r\nworkmen. One of them is blowing a pan of charcoal into flame through an\r\niron tube some eighteen inches long by one in diameter, and stirring\r\nup the loose charcoal. Another is hammering at a piece of silver\r\nwire on a little anvil before him. With his miserable tools the Hindu\r\ngoldsmith turns out work that well might, and often deservedly does,\r\nrank with the greatest triumphs of the jeweller's art.\"\r\n\r\nSondi.--The Sondis or Sundis are summed up in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1901, as \"Oriya toddy-selling caste. They do not draw toddy themselves,\r\nbut buy it from Siolos, and sell it. They also distill arrack.\" The\r\nword arrack or arak, it may be noted en passant, means properly\r\n\"perspiration, and then, first the exudation of sap drawn from the\r\ndate-palm; secondly, any strong drink, distilled spirit, etc.\" [184]\r\nA corruption of the word is rack, which occurs, e.g., in rack punch.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Sanskrit work, entitled Parasarapaddati, Soundikas\r\n(toddy-drawers and distillers of arrack) are the offspring of a\r\nKaivarata male and a Gaudike female. Both these castes are pratiloma\r\n(mixed) castes. In the Matsya Purana, the Soundikas are said to\r\nhave been born to Siva of seven Apsara women on the bank of the\r\nriver Son. Manu refers to the Soundikas, and says that a Snataka\r\n[185] may not accept food from trainers of hunting dogs, Soundikas,\r\na washerman, a dyer, pitiless man, and a man in whose house lives a\r\nparamour of his wife.\r\n\r\nIn a note on the allied Sunris or Sundis of Bengal, Mr. Risley writes\r\n[186] that \"according to Hindu ideas, distillers and sellers of strong\r\ndrink rank among the most degraded castes, and a curious story in the\r\nVaivarta Purana keeps alive the memory of their degradation. It is said\r\nthat when Sani, the Hindu Saturn, failed to adapt an elephant's head\r\nto the mutilated trunk of Ganesa, who had been accidentally beheaded\r\nby Siva, Viswakarma, the celestial artificer, was sent for, and by\r\ncareful dissection and manipulation he fitted the incongruous parts\r\ntogether, and made a man called Kedara Sena from the slices cut off in\r\nfashioning his work. This Kedara Sena was ordered to fetch a drink of\r\nwater for Bhagavati, weary and athirst. Finding on the river's bank a\r\nshell full of water, he presented it to her, without noticing that a\r\nfew grains of rice left in it by a parrot had fermented and formed an\r\nintoxicating liquid. Bhagavati, as soon as she had drunk, became aware\r\nof the fact, and in her anger condemned the offender to the vile and\r\nservile occupation of making spirituous liquor for mankind. Another\r\nstory traces their origin to a certain Bhaskar or Bhaskar Muni, who\r\nwas created by Krishna's brother, Balaram, to minister to his desire\r\nfor strong drink. A different version of the same legend gives them\r\nfor ancestor Niranjan, a boy found by Bhaskar floating down a river\r\nin a pot full of country liquor, and brought up by him as a distiller.\"\r\n\r\nFor the following note on the Sondis of Vizagapatam, I am indebted to\r\nMr. C. Hayavadana Rao. According to a current tradition, there was, in\r\ndays of old, a Brahman, who was celebrated for his magical powers. The\r\nking, his patron, asked him if he could make the water in a tank (pond)\r\nburn, and he replied in the affirmative. He was, however, in reality\r\ndisconsolate, because he did not know how to do it. By chance he met a\r\ndistiller, who asked him why he looked so troubled, and, on learning\r\nhis difficulty, promised to help him on condition that he gave him\r\nhis daughter in marriage. To this the Brahman consented. The distiller\r\ngave him a quantity of liquor to pour into the tank, and told him to\r\nset it alight in the presence of the king. The Brahman kept his word,\r\nand the Sondis are the descendants of the offspring of his daughter and\r\nthe distiller. The caste is divided into several endogamous divisions,\r\nviz., Bodo Odiya, Madhya kula, and Sanno kula. The last is said to\r\nbe made up of illegitimate descendants of the two first divisions.\r\n\r\nThe Sondis distil liquor from the ippa (Bassia) flower, rice, and\r\njaggery (crude sugar). There is a tradition that Brahma created the\r\nworld, and pinched up from a point between his eyebrows a little mud,\r\nfrom which he made a figure, and endowed it with life. Thus Suka Muni\r\nwas created, and authorised to distil spirit from the ippa flowers,\r\nwhich had hitherto been eaten by birds.\r\n\r\nWhen a girl reaches puberty, she is set apart in a room within\r\na square enclosure made with four arrows connected together by a\r\nthread. Turmeric and oil are rubbed over her daily, and, on the\r\nseventh day, she visits the local shrine.\r\n\r\nGirls are married before puberty. Some days before a wedding, a sal\r\n(Shorea robusta) or neredu (Eugenia Jambolana) post is set up in\r\nfront of the bridegroom's house, and a pandal (booth) erected round\r\nit. On the appointed day, a caste feast is held, and a procession\r\nof males proceeds to the bride's house, carrying with them finger\r\nrings, silver and glass bangles, and fifty rupees as the jholla tonka\r\n(bride price). On the following day, the bride goes to the house of the\r\nbridegroom. On the marriage day, the contracting couple go seven times\r\nround the central post of the pandal, and their hands are joined by\r\nthe presiding Oriya Brahman. They then sit down, and the sacred fire\r\nis raised. The females belonging to the bridegroom's party sprinkle\r\nthem with turmeric and rice. On the following day, a Bhondari (barber)\r\ncleans the pandal, and draws patterns in it with rice flour. A mat\r\nis spread, and the couple play with cowry shells. These are five\r\nin number, and the bridegroom holds them tightly in his right hand,\r\nwhile the bride tries to wrest them from him. If she succeeds in so\r\ndoing, her brothers beat the bridegroom, and make fun of him; if\r\nshe fails, the bridegroom's sisters beat and make fun of her. The\r\nbride then takes hold of the cowries, and the same performance is\r\ngone through. A basket of rice is brought, and some of it poured\r\ninto a vessel. The bridegroom holds a portion of it in his hand, and\r\nthe bride asks him to put it back. This, after a little coaxing, he\r\nconsents to do. These ceremonies are repeated during the next five\r\ndays. On the seventh day, small quantities of food are placed on\r\ntwelve leaves, and twelve Brahmans, who receive a present of money,\r\nsit down, and partake thereof. The marriage of widows is permitted,\r\nand a younger brother may marry the widow of an elder brother.\r\n\r\nThe dead are burned, and death pollution lasts for ten days. Daily,\r\nduring this period, cooked food is strewed on the way leading to the\r\nburning-ground. On the eleventh day, those under pollution bathe,\r\nand the sacred fire (homam) is raised by a Brahman. As at a wedding,\r\ntwelve Brahmans receive food and money. Towards midnight, a new pot\r\nis brought, and holes are bored in it. A lighted lamp and food are\r\nplaced in it, and it is taken towards the burning-ground and set down\r\non the ground. The dead man's name is then called out three times. He\r\nis informed that food is ready, and asked to come.\r\n\r\nMen, but not women, eat animal food. The women will not partake of\r\nthe remnants of their husbands' meal on days on which they eat meat,\r\nbecause, according to the legend, their female ancestor was a Brahman\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAmong the Sondis of Ganjam, if a girl does not secure a husband\r\nbefore she reaches maturity, she goes through a form of marriage\r\nwith an old man of the caste, or with her elder sister's husband,\r\nand may not marry until the man with whom she has performed this\r\nceremony dies. On the wedding day, the bridegroom is shaved, and his\r\nold waist-thread is replaced by a new one. The ceremonies commence\r\nwith the worship of Ganesa, and agree in the main with those of many\r\nother Oriya castes. The remarriage of widows is permitted. If a widow\r\nwas the wife of the first-born or eldest son in a family, she may not,\r\nafter his death, marry one of his younger brothers. She may, however,\r\ndo so if she was married in the first instance to a second son.\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Mr. C. F. MacCartie, in the Madras Census Report, 1881,\r\nthat \"a good deal of land has been sold by Khond proprietors to other\r\ncastes. It was in this way that much territory was found some years\r\nago to be passing into the hands of the Sundis or professional liquor\r\ndistillers. As soon as these facts were brought to the notice of\r\nGovernment, no time was lost in the adoption of repressive measures,\r\nwhich have been completely successful, as the recent census shows a\r\ngreat reduction in the numbers of these Sundis, who, now that their\r\nunscrupulous trade is abolished, have emigrated largely to Boad\r\nand other tracts. This is the only case to my knowledge in which a\r\nspecial trade has decayed, and with the best results, as, had it not\r\nbeen so, there is no doubt that the Khond population would very soon\r\nhave degenerated into pure adscripti glebæ, and the Sundis become\r\nthe landlords.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that\r\n\"besides ippa (liquor distilled from the blossom of Bassia latifolia),\r\nthe hill people brew beer from rice, samai (the millet Panicum\r\nmiliare), and ragi (Eleusine Coracana). They mash the grain in the\r\nordinary manner, add some more water to it, mix a small quantity\r\nof ferment with it, leave it to ferment three or four days, and\r\nthen strain off the grain. The beer so obtained is often highly\r\nintoxicating, and different kinds of it go by different names,\r\nsuch as londa, pandiyam, and maddikallu. The ferment which is used\r\nis called the saraiya-mandu (spirit drug) or Sondi-mandu (Sondi's\r\ndrug), and can be bought in the weekly market. There are numerous\r\nrecipes for making it, but the ingredients are always jungle roots\r\nand barks. [187] It is sold made up into small balls with rice. The\r\nactual shop-keepers and still-owners in the hills, especially in the\r\nParvatipur and Palkonda agencies, are usually immigrants of the Sondi\r\ncaste, a wily class who know exactly how to take advantage of the sin\r\nwhich doth so easily beset the hill man, and to wheedle from him, in\r\nexchange for the strong drink which he cannot do without, his ready\r\nmoney, his little possessions, his crops, and finally his land itself.\r\n\r\n\"The Sondis are gradually getting much of the best land into\r\ntheir hands, and many of the guileless hill ryots into their\r\npower. Mr. Taylor stated in 1892 that 'the rate of interest on loans\r\nextorted by these Sondis is 100 per cent. and, if this is not cleared\r\noff in the first year, compound interest at 100 per cent. is charged on\r\nthe balance. The result is that, in many instances, the cultivators\r\nare unable to pay in cash or kind, and become the gotis or serfs\r\nof the sowcars, for whom they have to work in return for mere batta\r\n(subsistence allowance), whilst the latter take care to manipulate\r\ntheir accounts in such a manner that the debt is never paid off. A\r\nremarkable instance of this tyranny was brought to my notice a few\r\ndays since. A ryot some fifty years ago borrowed Rs. 20; he paid back\r\nRs. 50 at intervals, and worked for the whole of his life, and died\r\nin harness. For the same debt the sowcar (money-lender) claimed the\r\nservices of his son, and he too died in bondage, leaving two small sons\r\naged 13 and 9, whose services were also claimed for an alleged arrear\r\nof Rs. 30 on a debt of Rs. 20 borrowed 50 years back, for which Rs. 50\r\nin cash had been repaid in addition to the perpetual labour of a man\r\nfor a similar period.' This custom of goti is firmly established, and,\r\nin a recent case, an elder brother claimed to be able to pledge for\r\nhis own debts the services of his younger brother, and even those of\r\nthe latter's wife. Debts due by persons of respectability are often\r\ncollected by the Sondis by an exasperating method, which has led\r\nto at least one case of homicide. They send Ghasis, who are one of\r\nthe lowest of all castes, and contact with whom is utter defilement\r\nentailing severe caste penalties, to haunt the house of the debtor who\r\nwill not pay, insult and annoy him and his family, and threaten to\r\ndrag him forcibly before the Sondi.\" A friend was, on one occasion,\r\nout after big game in the Jeypore hills, and shot a tiger. He asked\r\nhis shikari (tracker) what reward he should give him for putting him\r\non to the beast. The shikari replied that he would be quite satisfied\r\nwith twenty-five rupees, as he wanted to get his younger brother out\r\nof pledge. Asked what he meant, he replied that, two years previously,\r\nhe had purchased as his wife a woman who belonged to a caste higher\r\nthan his own for a hundred rupees. He obtained the money by pledging\r\nhis younger brother to a sowcar, and had paid it all back except\r\ntwenty-five rupees. Meanwhile his brother was the bondsman of the\r\nsowcar, and cultivating his land in return for simple food.\r\n\r\nIt is further recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district,\r\nthat Dombu (or Domb) dacoits \"force their way into the house of\r\nsome wealthy person (for choice the local Sondi liquor-seller and\r\nsowcar--usually the only man worth looting in an Agency village,\r\nand a shark who gets little pity from his neighbours when forced to\r\ndisgorge), tie up the men, rape the women, and go off with everything\r\nof value.\"\r\n\r\nThe titles of the Ganjam Sondis are Behara, Chowdri, Podhano,\r\nand Sahu. In the Vizagapatam agency tracts, their title is said to\r\nbe Bissoyi.\r\n\r\nSonkari.--The Sonkaris are a small class of Oriya lac bangle (sonka)\r\nmakers in Ganjam and Vizagapatam, who should not be confused with the\r\nTelugu Sunkaris. The men are engaged in agriculture, and the women\r\nmanufacture the bangles, chains, chamaras (fly-flappers), kolatam\r\nsticks (for stick play), and fans ornamented with devices in paddy\r\n(unhusked rice) grains, which are mainly sold to Europeans as curios.\r\n\r\nSonkari girls are married before puberty. A man should marry his\r\npaternal aunt's daughter, but at the present day this custom is\r\nfrequently disregarded. Brahmans officiate at their marriages. The\r\ndead are cremated. The caste title is Patro.\r\n\r\nSonkuva.--A sub-division of Mali.\r\n\r\nSonti (dried ginger).--An exogamous sept of Asili.\r\n\r\nSoppu (leaf).--The name for Koragas, who wear leafy garments.\r\n\r\nSozhia.--A territorial name of sub-divisions of various Tamil classes\r\nwho are settled in what was formerly the Chola country, e.g., Brahman,\r\nChetti, Kaikolan, Kammalan, Pallan, and Vellala.\r\n\r\nSrishti Karnam.--A sub-division of Karnam. The name is variously spelt,\r\ne.g., Sristi, Sishta, Sishti. The name Sishti Karanamalu is said to\r\nhave been assumed by Oddilu, who have raised themselves in life. [188]\r\n\r\nStala (a place).--Lingayats sometimes use the word Staladavaru,\r\nor natives of a place, to distinguish them from recent settlers.\r\n\r\nStanika.--The Stanikas are summed up, in the Madras Census Report,\r\n1901, as being \"Canarese temple servants. They claim to be Brahmans,\r\nthough other Brahmans do not admit the claim; and, as the total of the\r\ncaste has declined from 4,650 in 1891 to 1,469, they have apparently\r\nreturned themselves as Brahmans in considerable numbers.\" The Stanikas\r\nare, in the South Canara Manual, said to be \"the descendants of\r\nBrahmins by Brahmin widows and outcast Brahmin women, corresponding\r\nwith Manu's Golaka. They however now claim to be Siva Brahmins,\r\nforcibly dispossessed of authority by the Madhvas, and state that\r\nthe name Stanika is not that of a separate caste, but indicates their\r\nprofession as managers of temples, with the title of Deva Stanika. This\r\nclaim is not generally conceded, and as a matter of fact the duties\r\nin which Stanikas are employed are clearly those of temple servants,\r\nnamely, collecting flowers, sweeping the interiors of temples, looking\r\nafter the lamps, cleaning the temple vessels, ringing bells, and the\r\nlike. Many of them, however, are landowners and farmers. They are\r\ngenerally Sivites, and wear the sacred thread. Their special deities\r\nare Venkatramana and Ganapati. Dravida Brahmins officiate as their\r\npriests, but of late some educated men of the caste have assumed the\r\npriestly office. The caste has two sub-divisions, viz., Subramania and\r\nKumbla. Girls must be married in infancy, i.e., before they attain\r\npuberty. Widow remarriage is neither permitted nor practiced. Their\r\nother customs are almost the same as those of the Kota Brahmans. They\r\nneither eat flesh nor drink liquor.\" It is stated in the Manual that\r\nthe Stanikas are called Shanbogs and Mukhtesars. But I am informed that\r\nat an inquest or a search the Moktessors or Mukhtesars (chief men)\r\nof a village are assembled, and sign the inquest report or search\r\nlist. The Moktessors of any caste can be summoned together. Some of\r\nthe Moktessors of a temple may be Stanikas. In the case of social\r\ndisputes decided at caste meetings, the Shanbog (writer or accountant)\r\nappointed by the caste would record the evidence, and the Moktessor\r\nwould decide upon the facts.\r\n\r\nOf the two sections Subramanya and Kumbla, the former claim\r\nsuperiority, and there is no intermarriage between them. The members of\r\nthe Subramanya section state that they belong to Rig Saka (Rig Veda)\r\nand have gotras, such as Viswamitra, Angirasa, and Baradwaja, and\r\ntwelve exogamous septs. Of these septs, the following are examples:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Arli (Ficus religiosa).            Konde, tassel or hair-knot.\r\n     Aththi (Ficus glomerata).          Adhikari.\r\n     Bandi, cart.                       Pandita.\r\n     Kethaki (Pandanus fascicularis).   Heggade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous temple of Subramanya is said to have been in charge of the\r\nSubramanya Stanikas, till it was wrested from them by the Shivalli\r\nBrahmans. In former times, the privilege of sticking a golden ladle\r\ninto a heap of food piled up in the temple, on the Shasti day or sixth\r\nday after the new moon in December, is said to have belonged to the\r\nStanikas. They also brought earth from an ant-hill on the previous\r\nday. Food from the heap and earth are received as sacred articles by\r\ndevotees who visit the sacred shrine. A large number of Stanikas are\r\nstill attached to temples, where they perform the duties of cleaning\r\nthe vessels, washing rice, placing cooked food on the bali pitam (altar\r\nstone), etc. The food placed on the stone is eaten by Stanikas, but\r\nnot by Brahmans. In the Mysore province, a Brahman woman who partakes\r\nof this food loses her caste, and becomes a prostitute.\r\n\r\nAt times of census, Sivadvija and Siva Brahman have been given as\r\nsynonyms of Stanika.\r\n\r\nSthavara.--Recorded, at times of census, as a sub-division of\r\nJangam. The lingam, which Lingayats carry on some part of the body,\r\nis called the jangama lingam or moveable lingam, to distinguish it\r\nfrom the sthavara or fixed lingam of temples.\r\n\r\nSubuddhi.--A title, meaning one having good sense, among several\r\nOriya castes.\r\n\r\nSudarman.--See Udaiyan.\r\n\r\nSuddho.--Two distinct castes go by this name, viz., the Savaras who\r\nhave settled in the plains, and a small class of agriculturists and\r\npaiks (servants) in the low country of Ganjam. The Suddhos who live\r\nin the hills eat fowls and drink liquor, which those in the plains\r\nabstain from. The caste name Suddho means pure, and is said to have its\r\norigin in the fact that Suddho paiks used to tie the turbans of the\r\nkings of Gumsur. Like other Oriya castes, the Suddhos have Podhano,\r\nBissoyi, Behara, etc., as titles. The caste has apparently come into\r\nexistence in recent times.\r\n\r\nSudra.--The fourth of the traditional castes of Manu. The Sudra Nayars\r\nsupply the female servants in the houses of Nambutiris.\r\n\r\nSudra Kavutiyan.--A name adopted by barbers who shave Nayars, to\r\ndistinguish them from other barbers.\r\n\r\nSudugadusiddha.--The name is derived from sudugadu, a\r\nburning-ground. In the Mysore Census Report, 1901, they are\r\ndescribed as being \"mendicants like the Jogis, like whom they\r\nitinerate. They were once lords of burning-grounds, to whom the\r\nKulavadi (see Holeya), who takes the cloth of the deceased and a fee\r\nfor every dead body burned, paid something as acknowledging their\r\noverlordship.\" These people are described by Mr. J. S. F. Mackenzie,\r\n[189] under the name Sudgudu Siddha, or lords of the burning-ground,\r\nas agents who originally belonged to the Gangadikara Vakkaliga caste,\r\nand have become a separate caste, called after their head Sudgudu\r\nSiddharu. They intermarry among themselves, and the office of agent is\r\nhereditary. They have particular tracts of country assigned to them,\r\nwhen on tour collecting burial fees. They can be recognised by the\r\nwooden bell in addition to the usual metal one, which they always\r\ncarry about. Without this no one would acknowledge the agent's right\r\nto collect the fees.\r\n\r\nSugali.--Sugali and Sukali are synonyms of Lambadi.\r\n\r\nSugamanchi Balija.--A name said to mean the best of Balijas, and used\r\nas a synonym for Gazula Balija.\r\n\r\nSukka (star).--An exogamous sept of Yerukala. The equivalent Sukra\r\noccurs as a gotra of Oriya Kalinjis.\r\n\r\nSule.--A Canarese name for professional prostitutes. Temple\r\ndancing-girls object to the name, as being low. They call themselves\r\nVesyas or Besyas, Naiksani, or Naikini (Naik females).\r\n\r\nSullokondia.--The highest sub-division of the Gaudos, from whose\r\nhands Oriya Brahmans will accept water.\r\n\r\nSunar.--See Sonar.\r\n\r\nSundarattan.--A sub-division of Nattukottai Chetti.\r\n\r\nSundi.--See Sondi.\r\n\r\nSunkari.--The Sunkari or Sunkara-vandlu are cultivators, fishermen,\r\nand raftsmen in the Godavari district. According to the Rev. J. Cain\r\n[190] they come from some part of the Central Provinces, and are not\r\nregarded as outcasts, as stated in the Central Provinces Gazetteer.\r\n\r\nSunna Akki (thin rice).--A family name or bedagu of Donga Dasari.\r\n\r\nSunnambukkaran (lime man).--An occupational name for Paravas,\r\nParaiyans, and other classes, who are employed as lime (chunam)\r\nburners. Sunnapu, meaning shell or quick-lime, occurs as an exogamous\r\nsept of Balija.\r\n\r\nSunnata.--A sub-division of Kurumbas, who are said to make only\r\nwhite blankets.\r\n\r\nSurakkudi.--A section or kovil (temple) of Nattukottai Chetti.\r\n\r\nSurti.--The name for domestic servants of Europeans in Bombay, who\r\ncome from Surat.\r\n\r\nSurya (the sun).--Recorded as a sept of Domb, Kuruba, and Pentiya,\r\nand a sub-division of Ambalakkaran. The equivalent Suryavamsam (people\r\nof the solar race) occurs as a sub-division of Razu, and as a synonym\r\nof the Konda Doras or Konda Kapus, some of whom style themselves Raja\r\n(= Razu) Kapus or Reddis.\r\n\r\nSutakulam.--A name by which the Besthas call themselves. They claim\r\ndescent from the Rishi Suta Mahamuni. It has been suggested [191]\r\nas probable that the Besthas gained the name from their superiority\r\nin the culinary art, suta meaning cook.\r\n\r\nSutarlu.--Recorded by the Rev. J. Cain [192] as bricklayers and masons\r\nin the Godavari district.\r\n\r\nSuthala (needle).--An exogamous sept of Kamma.\r\n\r\nSvarupam.--Svarupam has been defined [193] as \"a dynasty,\r\nusually confined to the four principal dynasties, termed the Kola,\r\nNayaririppu, Perimbadappu, and Trippa Svarupam, represented by the\r\nKolatiri or Chirakal Rajah, the Zamorin, and the Cochin and Travancore\r\nRajahs.\" Svarupakkar or Svarupathil, meaning servants of Svarupams\r\nor kingly houses, is an occupational sub-division of Nayar.\r\n\r\nSwayi.--A title of Alia, Aruva, Kalinji, and other Oriya classes.\r\n\r\nSwetambara (clad in white).--One of the two main divisions of the\r\nJains.\r\n\r\nSyrian Christian.--The following note, containing a summary of the\r\nhistory of a community in connection with which the literature is\r\nconsiderable, is mainly abstracted from the Cochin Census Report,\r\n1901, with additions.\r\n\r\nThe Syrian Christians have \"sometimes been called the Christians of\r\nthe Serra (a Portuguese word, meaning mountains). This arose from the\r\nfact of their living at the foot of the ghauts.\" [194] The glory of the\r\nintroduction of the teachings of Christ to India is, by time-honoured\r\ntradition, ascribed to the apostle Saint Thomas. According to\r\nthis tradition so dearly cherished by the Christians of this coast,\r\nabout 52 A.D. the apostle landed at Malankara, or, more correctly, at\r\nMaliankara near Cranganur (Kodungallur), the Mouziris of the Greeks,\r\nor Muyirikode of the Jewish copper plates. Mouziris was a port near\r\nthe mouth of a branch of the Alwaye river, much frequented in their\r\nearly voyages by the Phoenician and European traders for the pepper and\r\nspices of this coast, and for the purpose of taking in fresh water and\r\nprovisions. The story goes that Saint Thomas founded seven churches\r\nin different stations in Cochin and Travancore, and converted, among\r\nothers, many Brahmans, notably the Cally, Calliankara, Sankarapuri,\r\nand Pakalomattam Nambudri families, the members of the last claiming\r\nthe rare distinction of having been ordained as priests by the apostle\r\nhimself. He then extended his labours to the Coromandel coast, where,\r\nafter making many converts, he is said to have been pierced with a\r\nlance by some Brahmans, and to have been buried in the church of\r\nSt. Thomé, in Mylapore, a suburb of the town of Madras. Writing\r\nconcerning the prevalence of elephantiasis in Malabar, Captain\r\nHamilton records [195] that \"the old Romish Legendaries impute the\r\ncause of those great swell'd legs to a curse Saint Thomas laid upon his\r\nmurderers and their posterity, and that was the odious mark they should\r\nbe distinguished by.\" \"Pretty early tradition associates Thomas with\r\nParthia, [196] Philip with Phrygia, Andrew with Syria, and Bartholomew\r\nwith India, but later traditions make the apostles divide the various\r\ncountries between them by lot.\" [197] Even if the former supposition\r\nbe accepted, there is nothing very improbable in Saint Thomas having\r\nextended his work from Parthia to India. Others argue that, even if\r\nthere be any truth in the tradition of the arrival of Saint Thomas\r\nin India, this comprised the countries in the north-west of India,\r\nor at most the India of Alexander the Great, and not the southern\r\nportion of the peninsula, where the seeds of Christianity are said to\r\nhave been first sown, because the voyage to this part of India, then\r\nhardly known, was fraught with the greatest difficulties and dangers,\r\nnot to speak of its tediousness. It may, however, be observed that\r\nthe close proximity of Alexandria to Palestine, and its importance\r\nat the time as the emporium of the trade between the East and West,\r\nafforded sufficient facilities for a passage to India. If the Roman\r\nline of traffic viâ Alexandria and the Red Sea was long and tedious,\r\nthe route viâ the Persian Gulf was comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the second century, we read of Demetrius of Alexandria\r\nreceiving a message from some natives of India, earnestly begging for\r\na teacher to instruct them in the doctrines of Christianity. Hearing\r\nthis, Pantænus, Principal of the Christian College of Alexandria,\r\nan Athenian stoic, an eminent preacher and \"a very great gnosticus,\r\nwho had penetrated most profoundly into the spirit of scripture,\"\r\nsailed from Berenice for Malabar between 180 and 190 A.D. He found\r\nhis arrival \"anticipated by some who were acquainted with the Gospel\r\nof Mathew, to whom Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached,\r\nand had left them the same Gospel in Hebrew, which also was preserved\r\nuntil this time. Returning to Alexandria, he presided over the\r\nCollege of Catechumens.\" Early in the third century, St. Hippolytus,\r\nBishop of Portus, also assigns the conversion of India to the apostle\r\nBartholomew. To Thomas he ascribes Persia and the countries of Central\r\nAsia, although he mentions Calamina, \"a city of India,\" as the place\r\nwhere Thomas suffered death. The Rev. J. Hough [198] observes that\r\n\"it is indeed highly problematical that Saint Bartholomew was ever\r\nin India.\" It may be remarked that there are no local traditions\r\nassociating the event with his name, and, if Saint Bartholomew\r\nlaboured at all on this coast, there is no reason why the earliest\r\nconverts of Malabar should have preferred the name of Thomas to that\r\nof Bartholomew. Though Mr. Hough and Sir W. W. Hunter, [199] among\r\nothers, discredit the mission of St. Thomas in the first century,\r\nthey both accept the story of the mission of Pantænus. Mr. Hough says\r\nthat \"it is probable that these Indians (who appealed to Demetrius)\r\nwere converts or children of former converts to Christianity.\" If,\r\nin the second century, there could be children of former converts in\r\nIndia, it is not clear why the introduction of Christianity to India\r\nin the first century, and that by St. Thomas, should be so seriously\r\nquestioned and set aside as being a myth, especially in view of the\r\nweight of the subjoined testimony, associating the work with the name\r\nof the apostle.\r\n\r\nIn the Asiatic Journal (Vol. VI), Mr. Whish refutes the assertions made\r\nby Mr. Wrede in the Asiatic Researches (Vol. VII) that the Christians\r\nof Malabar settled in that country \"during the violent persecution\r\nof the sect of Nestorius under Theodosius II, or some time after,\"\r\nand says, with reference to the date of the Jewish colonies in India,\r\nthat the Christians of the country were settled long anterior to the\r\nperiod mentioned by Mr. Wrede. Referring to the acts and journeyings\r\nof the apostles, Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre (254-313 A.D.), says \"the\r\nApostle Thomas, after having preached the Gospel to the Parthians,\r\nMedes, Persians, Germanians, Bactrians, and Magi, suffered martyrdom\r\nat Calamina, a town of India.\" It is said that, at the Council of\r\nNice held in 325 A.D., India was represented by Johannes, Bishop of\r\nIndia Maxima and Persia. St. Gregory of Nazianzen (370-392 A.D.),\r\nin answering the reproach of his being a stranger, asks \"Were not\r\nthe apostles strangers? Granting that Judæa was the country of\r\nPeter, what had Paul in common with the Gentiles, Luke with Achaia,\r\nAndrew with Epirus, John with Ephesus, Thomas with India, Mark with\r\nItaly\"? St. Jerome (390 A.D.) testifies to the general belief in\r\nthe mission of St. Thomas to India. He too mentions Calamina as the\r\ntown where the apostle met with his death. Baronius thinks that,\r\nwhen Theodoret, the Church historian (430-458 A.D.), speaks of the\r\napostles, he evidently associates the work in India with the name of\r\nSt. Thomas. St. Gregory of Torus relates that \"in that place in India,\r\nwhere the body of Thomas lay before it was transferred to Edessa,\r\nthere is a monastery and temple of great size.\" Florentius asserts\r\nthat \"nothing with more certainty I find in the works of the Holy\r\nFathers than that St. Thomas preached the Gospel in India.\" Rufinus,\r\nwho stayed twenty-five years in Syria, says that the remains of\r\nSt. Thomas were brought from India to Edessa. Two Arabian travellers\r\nof the ninth century, referred to by Renaudot, assert that St. Thomas\r\ndied at Mailapur.\r\n\r\nComing to modern times, we have several authorities, who testify to\r\nthe apostolic origin of the Indian Church, regarded as apocryphal by\r\nMr. Milne Rae, Sir W. W. Hunter, and others. The historian of the\r\n'Indian Empire,' while rejecting some of the strongest arguments\r\nadvanced by Mr. Milne Rae, accepts his conclusions in regard to the\r\napostolic origin. The Romanist Portuguese in their enthusiasm coloured\r\nthe legends to such an extent as to make them appear incredible,\r\nand the Protestant writers of modern times, while distrusting\r\nthe Portuguese version, are not agreed as to the rare personage\r\nthat introduced Christianity to India. Mr. Wrede asserts that the\r\nChristians of Malabar settled in that country during the violent\r\npersecution of the sect of Nestorius under Theodosius II, or some\r\ntime after. Dr. Burnell traces the origin to the Manichæan Thomas,\r\nwho flourished towards the end of the third century. Mr. Milne Rae\r\nbrings the occurrence of the event down to the sixth century of the\r\nChristian era. Sir William Hunter, without associating the foundation\r\nof the Malabar Church with the name of any particular person, states\r\nthe event to have taken place some time in the second century,\r\nlong before the advent of Thomas the Manichæan, but considers that\r\nthe name St. Thomas Christians was adopted by the Christians in the\r\neighth century. He observes that \"the early legend of the Manichæan\r\nThomas in the third century and the later labours of the Armenian\r\nThomas, the rebuilder of the Malabar Church in the eighth century,\r\nendeared that name to the Christians of Southern India.\" [It has\r\nrecently been stated, with reference to the tradition that it was\r\nSt. Thomas the apostle who first evangelised Southern India, that,\r\n\"though this tradition is no more capable of disproof than of proof,\r\nthose authorities seem to be on safer ground, who are content to\r\nhold that Christianity was first imported into India by Nestorian or\r\nChaldæan missionaries from Persia and Mesopotamia, whose apostolic\r\nzeal between the sixth and twelfth centuries ranged all over Asia,\r\neven into Tibet and Tartary. The seat of the Nestorian Patriarchate\r\nof Babylon was at Bagdad, and, as it claimed to be par excellence\r\nthe Church of St. Thomas, this might well account for the fact that\r\nthe proselytes it won over in India were in the habit of calling\r\nthemselves Christians of St. Thomas. It is, to say the least, a\r\nremarkable coincidence that one of the three ancient stone crosses\r\npreserved in India bears an inscription and devices, which are stated\r\nto resemble those on the cross discovered near Singanfu in China,\r\nrecording the appearance of Nestorian missionaries in Shenshi in the\r\nearly part of the seventh century.\"]\r\n\r\nAs already said, there are those who attribute the introduction of\r\nthe Gospel to a certain Thomas, a disciple of Manes, who is supposed\r\nto have come to India in 277 A.D., finding in this an explanation\r\nof the origin of the Manigramakars (inhabitants of the village\r\nof Manes) of Kayenkulam near Quilon. Coming to the middle of the\r\nfourth century, we read of a Thomas Cana, an Aramæan or Syrian\r\nmerchant, or a divine, as some would have it, who, having in his\r\ntravels seen the neglected conditions of the flock of Christ on the\r\nMalabar coast, returned to his native land, sought the assistance of\r\nthe Catholics of Bagdad, came back with a train of clergymen and a\r\npretty large number of Syrians, and worked vigorously to better their\r\nspiritual condition. He is said to have married two Indian ladies,\r\nthe disputes of succession between whose children appear, according\r\nto some writers, to have given rise to the two names of Northerners\r\n(Vadakkumbagar) and Southerners (Thekkumbagar)--a distinction which\r\nis still jealously kept up. The authorities are, however, divided as\r\nto the date of his arrival, for, while some assign 345 A.D., others\r\ngive 745 A.D. It is just possible that this legend but records the\r\nadvent of two waves of colonists from Syria at different times, and\r\ntheir settlement in different stations; and Thomas Cana was perhaps\r\nthe leader of the first migration. The Syrian tradition explains\r\nthe origin of the names in a different way, for, according to it,\r\nthe foreigners or colonists from Syria lived in the southern street\r\nof Cranganur or Kodungallur, and the native converts in the northern\r\nstreet. After their dispersion from Cranganur, the Southerners kept\r\nup their pride and prestige by refusing to intermarry, while the name\r\nof Northerners came to be applied to all Native Christians other than\r\nthe Southerners. At their wedding feasts, the Southerners sing songs\r\ncommemorating their colonization at Kodungallur, their dispersion\r\nfrom there, and settlement in different places. They still retain\r\nsome foreign tribe names, to which the original colony is said\r\nto have belonged. A few of these names are Baji, Kojah, Kujalik,\r\nand Majamuth. Their leader Thomas Cana is said to have visited the\r\nlast of the Perumals and to have obtained several privileges for the\r\nbenefit of the Christians. He is supposed to have built a church at\r\nMahadevarpattanam, or more correctly Mahodayapuram, near Kodungallur\r\nin the Cochin State, the capital of the Perumals or Viceroys of Kerala,\r\nand, in their documents, the Syrian Christians now and again designate\r\nthemselves as being inhabitants of Mahadevarpattanam.\r\n\r\nIn the Syrian seminary at Kottayam are preserved two copper-plate\r\ncharters, one granted by Vira Raghava Chakravarthi,and the\r\nother by Sthanu Ravi Gupta, supposed to be dated 774 A.D. and 824\r\nA.D. Specialists, who have attempted to fix approximately the dates\r\nof the grants, however, differ, as will be seen from a discussion of\r\nthe subject by Mr. V. Venkayya in the Epigraphia Indica. [200]\r\n\r\nConcerning the plate of Vira Raghava, Mr. Venkayya there writes\r\nas follows. \"The subjoined inscription is engraved on both sides\r\nof a single copper-plate, which is in the possession of the Syrian\r\nChristians at Kottayam. The plate has no seal, but, instead, a conch is\r\nengraved about the middle of the left margin of the second side. This\r\ninscription has been previously translated by Dr. Gundert. [201]\r\nMr. Kookel Keloo Nair has also attempted a version of the grant. [202]\r\nIn the translation I have mainly followed Dr. Gundert.\"\r\n\r\nTranslation.\r\n\r\nHari! Prosperity! Adoration to the great Ganapati! On the day of (the\r\nNakshatra) Rohini, a Saturday after the expiration of the twenty-first\r\n(day) of the solar month Mina (of the year during which) Jupiter (was)\r\nin Makara, while the glorious Vira-Raghava-Chakravartin,--(of the race)\r\nthat has been wielding the sceptre for several hundred thousands\r\nof years in regular succession from the glorious king of kings,\r\nthe glorious Vira-Kerala-Chakravartin--was ruling prosperously:--\r\n\r\nWhile (we were) pleased to reside in the great palace, we conferred\r\nthe title of Manigramam on Iravikorttan, alias Seramanloka-pperun-jetti\r\nof Magodaiyarpattinam.\r\n\r\nWe (also) gave (him the right of) festive clothing, house pillars,\r\nthe income that accrues, the export trade (?), monopoly of trade, (the\r\nright of) proclamation, forerunners, the five musical instruments,\r\na conch, a lamp in day-time, a cloth spread (in front to walk on),\r\na palanquin, the royal parasol, the Telugu (?) drum, a gateway with\r\nan ornamental arch, and monopoly of trade in the four quarters.\r\n\r\nWe (also) gave the oilmongers and the five (classes of) artisans as\r\n(his) slaves.\r\n\r\nWe (also) gave, with a libation of water--having (caused it to be)\r\nwritten on a copper-plate--to Iravikorttan, who is the lord of\r\nthe city, the brokerage on (articles) that may be measured with\r\nthe para, weighed by the balance or measured with the tape, that\r\nmay be counted or weighed, and on all other (articles) that are\r\nintermediate--including salt, sugar, musk (and) lamp oil--and also\r\nthe customs levied on these (articles) between the river mouth of\r\nKodungallur and the gate (gopura)--chiefly between the four temples\r\n(tali) and the village adjacent to (each) temple.\r\n\r\nWe gave (this) as property to Sêramân-lôka-pperun-jetti, alias\r\nIravikorttan, and to his children's children in due succession.\r\n\r\n(The witnesses) who know this (are):--We gave (it) with the knowledge\r\nof the villagers of Panniyûr and the villagers of Sôgiram.

We gave (it) for the time that the moon and the sun\r\nshall exist.\r\n\r\nThe hand-writing of Sêramân-lôka-pperun-dattan Nambi Sadeyan, who wrote\r\n(this) copper-plate with the knowledge of these (witnesses).\r\n\r\nMr. Venkayya adds that \"it was supposed by Dr. Burnell [203] that\r\nthe plate of Vîra-Râghava created the principality of Manigramam,\r\nand the Cochin plates that of Anjuvannam. [204] The Cochin plates\r\ndid not create Anjuvannam, but conferred the honours and privileges\r\nconnected therewith to a Jew named Rabbân. Similarly, the rights\r\nand honours associated with the other corporation, Manigrâmam, were\r\nbestowed at a later period on Ravikkorran. It is just possible that\r\nRavikkorran was a Christian by religion. But his name and title give\r\nno clue in this direction, and there is nothing Christian in the\r\ndocument, except its possession by the present owners. On this name,\r\nDr. Gundert first said [205] 'Iravi Corttan must be a Nasrani name,\r\nthough none of the Syrian priests whom I saw could explain it, or had\r\never heard of it.' Subsequently he added: 'I had indeed been startled\r\nby the Iravi Corttan, which does not look at all like the appellation\r\nof a Syrian Christian; still I thought myself justified in calling\r\nManigrâmam a Christian principality--whatever their Christianity may\r\nhave consisted in--on the ground that, from Menezes' time, these grants\r\nhad been regarded as given to the Syrian colonists.' Mr. Kookel Keloo\r\nNair considered Iravikkorran a mere title, in which no shadow of a\r\nSyrian name is to be traced.\"\r\n\r\nNestorius, a native of Germanicia, was educated at Antioch, where,\r\nas Presbyter, he became celebrated, while yet very young, for his\r\nasceticism, orthodoxy, and eloquence. On the death of Sisinnius,\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople, this distinguished preacher of Antioch\r\nwas appointed to the vacant See by the Emperor Theodosius II, and\r\nwas consecrated as Patriarch in 428 A.D. The doctrine of a God-man\r\nrespecting Christ, and the mode of union of the human and the divine\r\nnature in Him left undefined by the early teachers, who contented\r\nthemselves with speaking of Him and regarding Him as \"born and unborn,\r\nGod in flesh, life in death, born of Mary, and born of God,\" had, long\r\nbefore the time of Nestorius, begun to tax the genius of churchmen, and\r\nthe controversies in respect of this double nature of Christ had led\r\nto the growth and spread of important heretical doctrines. Two of the\r\ngreat heresies of the church before that of Nestorius are associated\r\nwith the names of Arius and Apollinaris. Arius \"admitted both the\r\ndivine and the human nature of Christ, but, by making Him subordinate\r\nto God, denied His divinity in the highest sense.\" Apollinaris,\r\nundermining the doctrine of the example and atonement of Christ,\r\nargued that \"in Jesus the Logos supplied the place of the reasonable\r\nsoul.\" As early as 325 A.D. the first OEcumenical Council of Nice\r\nhad defined against the Arians, and decreed that \"the Son was not\r\nonly of like essence, but of the same essence with the Father, and\r\nthe human nature, maimed and misinterpreted by the Apollinarians, had\r\nbeen restored to the person of Christ at the Council of Constantinople\r\nin 381.\" Nestorius, finding the Arians and Apollinarians, condemned\r\nstrongly though they were, still strong in numbers and influence\r\nat Constantinople, expressed in his first sermon as Patriarch his\r\ndetermination to put down these and other heretical sects, and\r\nexhorted the Emperor to help him in this difficult task. But, while\r\nvigorously engaged in the effectual extinction of all heresies, he\r\nincurred the displeasure of the orthodox party by boldly declaring,\r\nthough in the most sincerely orthodox form, against the use of the\r\nterm Theotokos, that is, Mother of God, which, as applied to the\r\nVirgin Mary, had then grown into popular favour, especially amongst\r\nthe clergy at Constantinople and Rome. While he himself revered the\r\nBlessed Virgin as the Mother of Christ, he declaimed against the use\r\nof the expression Mother of God in respect of her, as being alike\r\n\"unknown to the Apostles, and unauthorised by the Church,\" besides\r\nits being inherently absurd to suppose that the Godhead can be born or\r\nsuffer. Moreover, in his endeavour to avoid the extreme positions taken\r\nup by Arians and Apollinarians, he denied, while speaking of the two\r\nnatures in Christ, that there was any communication of attributes. But\r\nhe was understood on this point to have maintained a mechanical rather\r\nthan a supernatural union of the two natures, and also to have rent\r\nChrist asunder, and divided Him into two persons. Explaining his\r\nposition, Nestorius said \"I distinguish the natures, but I unite my\r\nadoration.\" But this explanation did not satisfy the orthodox, who\r\nunderstood him to have \"preached a Christ less than divine.\" The clergy\r\nand laity of Constantinople, amongst whom Nestorius had thus grown\r\nunpopular, and was talked of as a heretic, appealed to Cyril, Bishop\r\nof the rival See of Alexandria, to interfere on their behalf. Cyril,\r\nsupported by the authority of the Pope, arrived on the scene, and, at\r\nthe Council of Ephesus, hastily and informally called up, condemned\r\nNestorius as a heretic, and excommunicated him. After Nestorianism\r\nhad been rooted out of the Roman Empire in the time of Justinian,\r\nit flourished \"in the East,\" especially in Persia and the countries\r\nadjoining it, where the churches, since their foundation, had been\r\nfollowing the Syrian ritual, discipline, and doctrine, and where\r\na strong party, among them the Patriarch of Seleucia or Babylon,\r\nand his suffragan the Metropolitan of Persia, with their large\r\nfollowing, revered Nestorius as a martyr, and faithfully and formally\r\naccepted his teachings at the Synod of Seleucia in 448 A.D. His\r\ndoctrines seem to have spread as far east as China, so that, in 551,\r\nNestorian monks who had long resided in that country are said to have\r\nbrought the eggs of the silkworm to Constantinople. Cosmos, surnamed\r\nIndicopleustes, the Indian traveller, who, in 522 A.D., visited Male,\r\n\"the country where the pepper grows,\" has referred to the existence\r\nof a fully organised church in Malabar, with the Bishops consecrated\r\nin Persia. His reference, while it traces the origin of the Indian\r\nchurch to the earlier centuries, also testifies to the fact that,\r\nat the time of his visit, the church was Nestorian in its creed\r\n\"from the circumstance of its dependence upon the Primate of Persia,\r\nwho then unquestionably held the Nestorian doctrines.\"\r\n\r\nThe next heresy was that of Eutyches, a zealous adherent of Cyril in\r\nopposition to Nestorius at the Council of Ephesus in 431 A.D. But\r\nEutyches, in opposing the doctrine of Nestorius, went beyond Cyril\r\nand others, and affirmed that, after the union of the two natures,\r\nthe human and the divine, Christ had only one nature the divine,\r\nHis humanity being absorbed in His divinity. After several years\r\nof controversy, the question was finally decided at the Council of\r\nChalcedon in 451, when it was declared, in opposition to the doctrine\r\nof Eutyches, that the two natures were united in Christ, but \"without\r\nany alteration, absorption, or confusion\"; or, in other words, in the\r\nperson of Christ there were two natures, the human and the divine,\r\neach perfect in itself, but there was only one person. Eutyches was\r\nexcommunicated, and died in exile. Those who would not subscribe to\r\nthe doctrines declared at Chalcedon were condemned as heretics; they\r\nthen seceded, and afterwards gathered themselves around different\r\ncentres, which were Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, Cyprus and\r\nPalestine, Armenia, Egypt, and Abyssinia. The Armenians embraced\r\nthe Eutychian theory of divinity being the sole nature in Christ,\r\nthe humanity being absorbed, while the Egyptians and Abyssinians\r\nheld in the monophysite doctrine of the divinity and humanity being\r\none compound nature in Christ. The West Syrians, or natives of Syria\r\nproper, to whom the Syrians of this coast trace their origin, adopted,\r\nafter having renounced the doctrines of Nestorius, the Eutychian\r\ntenet. Through the influence of Severus, Patriarch of Antioch, they\r\ngradually became Monophysites. The Monophysite sect was for a time\r\nsuppressed by the Emperors, but in the sixth century there took place\r\nthe great Jacobite revival of the monophysite doctrine under James\r\nBardæus, better known as Jacobus Zanzalus, who united the various\r\ndivisions, into which the Monophysites had separated themselves,\r\ninto one church, which at the present day exists under the name of\r\nthe Jacobite church. The head of the Jacobite church claims the rank\r\nand prerogative of the Patriarch of Antioch--a title claimed by no\r\nless than three church dignitaries. Leaving it to subtle theologians\r\nto settle the disputes, we may briefly define the position of the\r\nJacobites in Malabar in respect of the above controversies. While\r\nthey accept the qualifying epithets pronounced by the decree passed\r\nat the Council of Chalcedon in regard to the union of the two natures\r\nin Christ, they object to the use of the word two in referring to\r\nthe same. So far they are practically at one with the Armenians, for\r\nthey also condemn the Eutychian doctrine; and a Jacobite candidate\r\nfor holy orders in the Syrian church has, among other things, to take\r\nan oath denouncing Eutyches and his teachers.\r\n\r\nWe have digressed a little in order to show briefly the position\r\nof the Malabar church in its relation to Eastern Patriarchs in\r\nthe early, mediæval, and modern times. To resume the thread of our\r\nstory, from about the middle of the fourth century until the arrival\r\nof the Portuguese, the Christians of Malabar in their spiritual\r\ndistress generally applied for Bishops indiscriminately to one of\r\nthe Eastern Patriarchs, who were either Nestorian or Jacobite; for,\r\nas observed by Sir W. W. Hunter, \"for nearly a thousand years from\r\nthe 5th to the 15th century, the Jacobite sect dwelt in the middle\r\nof the Nestorians in the Central Asia,\" so that, in response to the\r\nrequests from Malabar, both Nestorian and Jacobite Bishops appear\r\nto have visited Malabar occasionally, and the natives seem to have\r\nindiscriminately followed the teachings of both. We may here observe\r\nthat the simple folk of Malabar, imbued but with the primitive form\r\nof Christianity, were neither conversant with nor ever troubled\r\nthemselves about the subtle disputations and doctrinal differences\r\nthat divided their co-religionists in Europe and Asia Minor, and\r\nwere, therefore, not in a position to distinguish between Nestorian\r\nor any other form of Christianity. Persia also having subsequently\r\nneglected the outlying Indian church, the Christians of Malabar seem\r\nto have sent their applications to the Patriarch of Babylon, but,\r\nas both prelates then followed the Nestorian creed, there was little\r\nor no change in the rituals and dogmas of the church. Dr. Day [206]\r\nrefers to the arrival of a Jacobite Bishop in India in 696 A.D. About\r\nthe year 823 A.D., two Nestorian Bishops, Mar Sapor and Mar Aprot,\r\nappear to have arrived in Malabar under the command of the Nestorian\r\nPatriarch of Babylon. They are said to have interviewed the native\r\nrulers, travelled through the country, built churches, and looked\r\nafter the religious affairs of the Syrians.\r\n\r\nWe know but little of the history of the Malabar Church for nearly six\r\ncenturies prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in India. We have,\r\nhowever, the story of the pilgrimage of the Bishop of Sherborne to the\r\nshrine of St. Thomas in India about 883 A.D., in the reign of Alfred\r\nthe Great; and the reference made to the prevalence of Nestorianism\r\namong the St. Thomas' Christians of Malabar by Marco Polo, the\r\nVenetian traveller.\r\n\r\nThe Christian community seem to have been in the zenith of their glory\r\nand prosperity between the 9th and 14th centuries, as, according\r\nto their tradition, they were then permitted to have a king of\r\ntheir own, with Villiarvattam near Udayamperur (Diamper) as his\r\ncapital. According to another version, the king of Villiarvattam was\r\na convert to Christianity. The dynasty seems to have become extinct\r\nabout the 14th century, and it is said that, on the arrival of the\r\nPortuguese, the crown and sceptre of the last Christian king were\r\npresented to Vasco da Gama in 1502. We have already referred to the\r\nhigh position occupied by the Christians under the early kings, as\r\nis seen from the rare privileges granted to them, most probably in\r\nreturn for military services rendered by them. The king seems to have\r\nenjoyed, among other things, the right of punishing offences committed\r\nby the Christian community, who practically followed his lead. A more\r\nreasonable view of the story of a Christian king appears to be that\r\na Christian chief of Udayamperur enjoyed a sort of socio-territorial\r\njurisdiction over his followers, which, in later times, seems to have\r\nbeen so magnified as to invest him with territorial sovereignty. We\r\nsee, in the copper-plate charters of the Jews, that their chief was\r\nalso invested with some such powers.\r\n\r\nMention is made of two Latin Missions in the 14th century, with\r\nQuilon as head-quarters, but their labours were ineffectual, and their\r\ntriumphs but short-lived. Towards the end of the 15th, and throughout\r\nthe whole of the 16th century, the Nestorian Patriarch of Mesopotamia\r\nseems to have exercised some authority over the Malabar Christians, as\r\nis borne out by the occasional references to the arrival of Nestorian\r\nBishops to preside over the churches.\r\n\r\nUntil the arrival of the Portuguese, the Malabar church was following\r\nunmolested, in its ritual, practice and communion, a creed of the\r\nSyro-Chaldæan church of the East. When they set out on their voyages,\r\nconquest and conversion were no less dear to the heart of Portuguese\r\nthan enterprise and commerce. Though, in the first moments, the\r\nSyrians, in their neglected spiritual condition, were gratified at\r\nthe advent of their co-religionists, the Romanist Portuguese, and\r\nthe Portuguese in their turn expected the most beneficial results\r\nfrom an alliance with their Christian brethren on this coast,\r\n\"the conformity of the Syrians to the faith and practice of the 5th\r\ncentury soon disappointed the prejudices of the Papist apologists. It\r\nwas the first care of the Portuguese to intercept all correspondence\r\nwith the Eastern Patriarchs, and several of their Bishops expired\r\nin the prisons of their Holy Office.\" The Franciscan and Dominican\r\nFriars, and the Jesuit Fathers, worked vigorously to win the Malabar\r\nChristians over to the Roman Communion. Towards the beginning of\r\nthe last quarter of the 16th century, the Jesuits built a church at\r\nVaippacotta near Cranganur, and founded a college for the education of\r\nChristian youths. In 1584, a seminary was established for the purpose\r\nof instructing the Syrians in theology, and teaching them the Latin,\r\nPortuguese and Syriac languages. The dignitaries who presided over\r\nthe churches, however, refused to ordain the students trained in the\r\nseminary. This, and other causes of quarrel between the Jesuits and\r\nthe native clergy, culminated in an open rupture, which was proclaimed\r\nby Archdeacon George in a Synod at Angamali. When Alexes de Menezes,\r\nArchbishop of Goa, heard of this, he himself undertook a visitation\r\nof the Syrian churches. The bold and energetic Menezes carried all\r\nbefore him. Nor is his success to be wondered at. He was invested with\r\nthe spiritual authority of the Pope, and armed with the terrors of the\r\nInquisition. He was encouraged in his efforts by the Portuguese King,\r\nwhose Governors on this coast ably backed him up. Though the ruling\r\nchiefs at first discountenanced the exercise of coercive measures\r\nover their subjects, they were soon won over by the stratagems of the\r\nsubtle Archbishop. Thus supported, he commenced his visitation of the\r\nchurches, and reduced them in A.D. 1599 by the decrees of the Synod of\r\nDiamper (Udayamperur), a village about ten miles to the south-east of\r\nthe town of Cochin. The decrees passed by the Synod were reluctantly\r\nsubscribed to by Archdeacon George and a large number of Kathanars,\r\nas the native priests are called; and this practically converted\r\nthe Malabar Church into a branch of the Roman Church. Literature\r\nsustained a very great loss at the hands of Menezes, \"for this blind\r\nand enthusiastic inquisitor destroyed, like a second Omar, all the\r\nbooks written in the Syrian or Chaldæan language, which could be\r\ncollected, not only at the Synod of Diamper, but especially during\r\nhis subsequent circuit; for, as soon as he had entered into a Syrian\r\nChurch, he ordered all their books and records to be laid before him,\r\nwhich, a few indifferent ones excepted, he committed to the flames,\r\nso that at present neither books nor manuscripts are any more to be\r\nfound amongst the St. Thomé Christians.\" [207]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Synod of Diamper, a Jesuit Father, Franciscus\r\nRoz, a Spaniard by birth, was appointed Bishop of Angamali by Pope\r\nClement VIII. The title was soon after changed to that of Archbishop\r\nof Cranganur. By this time, the rule of the Jesuits had become so\r\nintolerable to the Syrians that they resolved to have a Bishop from\r\nthe East, and applied to Babylon, Antioch, Alexandria, and other\r\necclesiastical head-quarters for a Bishop, as if the ecclesiastical\r\nheads who presided over these places professed the same creed. The\r\nrequest of the Malabar Christians for a Bishop was readily responded\r\nto from Antioch, and Ahattala, otherwise known as Mar Ignatius,\r\nwas forthwith sent. Authorities, however, differ on this point,\r\nfor, according to some, this Ahattala was a Nestorian, or a protégé\r\nof the Patriarch of the Copts. Whatever Ahattala's religious creed\r\nmight have been, the Syrians appear to have believed that he was\r\nsent by the Jacobite Patriarch of Antioch. The Portuguese, however,\r\nintercepted him, and took him prisoner. The story goes that he\r\nwas drowned in the Cochin harbour, or condemned to the flames of\r\nthe Inquisition at Goa in 1653. This cruel deed so infuriated the\r\nSyrians that thousands of them met in solemn conclave at the Coonen\r\nCross at Mattancheri in Cochin, and, with one voice, renounced their\r\nallegiance to the Church of Rome. This incident marks an important\r\nepoch in the history of the Malabar Church, for, with the defection\r\nat the Coonen Cross, the Malabar Christians split themselves up into\r\ntwo distinct parties, the Romo-Syrians who adhered to the Church of\r\nRome, and the Jacobite Syrians, who, severing their connection with\r\nit, placed themselves under the spiritual supremacy of the Patriarch\r\nof Antioch. The following passage explains the exact position of the\r\ntwo parties that came into existence then, as also the origin of the\r\nnames since applied to them. \"The Pazheia Kuttukar, or old church,\r\nowed its foundation to Archbishop Menezes and the Synod of Diamper in\r\n1599, and its reconciliation, after revolt, to the Carmelite Bishop,\r\nJoseph of St. Mary, in 1656. It retains in its services the Syrian\r\nlanguage, and in part the Syrian ritual. But it acknowledges the\r\nsupremacy of the Pope and his Vicars Apostolic. Its members are\r\nnow known as Catholics of the Syrian rite, to distinguish them from\r\nthe converts made direct from heathenism to the Latin Church by the\r\nRoman missionaries. The other section of the Syrian Christians of\r\nMalabar is called the Puttan Kuttukar, or new church. It adheres\r\nto the Jacobite tenets introduced by its first Jacobite Bishop,\r\nMar Gregory, in 1665.\" [208] We have at this time, and ever after,\r\nto deal with a third party, that came into existence after the advent\r\nof the Portuguese. These are the Catholics of the Latin rite, and\r\nconsist almost exclusively of the large number of converts gained by\r\nthe Portuguese from amongst the different castes of the Hindus. To\r\navoid confusion, we shall follow the fortunes of each sect separately.\r\n\r\nWhen the Portuguese first came to India, the Indian trade was\r\nchiefly in the hands of the Moors, who had no particular liking\r\nfor the Hindus or Christians, and the arrival of the Portuguese was\r\ntherefore welcome alike to the Hindus and Christians, who eagerly\r\nsought their assistance. The Portuguese likewise accepted their offers\r\nof friendship very gladly, as an alliance, especially with the former,\r\ngave them splendid opportunities for advancing their religious mission,\r\nwhile, from a friendly intercourse with the latter, they expected not\r\nonly to further their religious interests, but also their commercial\r\nprosperity. In the work of conversion they were successful, more\r\nespecially among the lower orders, the Illuvans, Mukkuvans, Pulayans,\r\netc. The labours of Miguel Vaz, afterwards Vicar-General of Goa, and\r\nof Father Vincent, in this direction were continued with admirable\r\nsuccess by St. Francis Xavier.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the strict and rigid discipline of the Jesuit\r\nArchbishops, their pride and exclusiveness, and the capture and murder\r\nof Ahattala brought about the outburst at the Coonen Cross. Seeing\r\nthat the Jesuits had failed, Pope Alexander VII had recourse to the\r\nCarmelite Fathers, who were specially instructed to do their best to\r\nremove the schism, and to bring about a reconciliation; but, because\r\nthe Portuguese claimed absolute possession of the Indian Missions,\r\nand as the Pope had despatched the Carmelite Fathers without the\r\napproval of the King of Portugal, the first batch of these missionaries\r\ncould not reach the destined field of their labours. Another body of\r\nCarmelites, who had taken a different route, however, succeeded in\r\nreaching Malabar in 1656, and they met Archdeacon Thomas who had\r\nsucceeded Archdeacon George. While expressing their willingness\r\nto submit to Rome, the Syrians declined to place themselves under\r\nArchbishop Garcia, S.J., who had succeeded Archbishop Roz, S.J. The\r\nSyrians insisted on their being given a non-Jesuit Bishop, and, in\r\n1659, Father Joseph was appointed Vicar Apostolic of the \"Sierra of\r\nMalabar\" without the knowledge of the King of Portugal. He came out\r\nto India in 1661, and worked vigorously for two years in reconciling\r\nthe Syrian Christians to the Church of Rome. But he was not allowed\r\nto continue his work unmolested, because, when the Dutch, who were\r\ncompeting with the Portuguese for supremacy in the Eastern seas, took\r\nthe port of Cochin in 1663, Bishop Joseph was ordered to leave the\r\ncoast forthwith. When he left Cochin, he consecrated Chandy Parambil,\r\notherwise known as Alexander de Campo.\r\n\r\nBy their learning, and their skill in adapting themselves to\r\ncircumstances, the Carmelite Fathers had continued to secure the\r\ngood-will of the Dutch, and, returning to Cochin, assisted Alexander\r\nde Campo in his work. Father Mathew, one of their number, was allowed\r\nto build a church at Chatiath near Ernakulam. Another church was\r\nbuilt at Varapuzha (Verapoly) on land given rent-free by the Raja of\r\nCochin. Since this time, Varapuzha, now in Travancore, has continued\r\nto be the residence of a Vicar Apostolic.\r\n\r\nThe history of a quarter of a century subsequent to this is\r\nuneventful, except for the little quarrels between the Carmelite\r\nFathers and the native clergy. In 1700, however, the Archbishop of\r\nGoa declined to consecrate a Carmelite Father nominated by the Pope\r\nto the Vicariate Apostolic. But Father Anjelus, the Vicar Apostolic\r\nelect, got himself consecrated by one Mar Simon, who was supposed\r\nto be in communion with Rome. The Dutch Government having declined\r\nadmission to Archbishop Ribeiro, S.J., the nominee of the Portuguese\r\nKing to their dominions, Anjelus was invested with jurisdiction over\r\nCochin and Cranganur. Thereupon, the Jesuit Fathers sought shelter in\r\nTravancore, and in the territories of the Zamorin. With the capture\r\nof Cranganur by the Dutch, which struck the death-blow to Portuguese\r\nsupremacy in the East, the last vestige of the church, seminary and\r\ncollege founded by the Jesuits disappeared. As the Dutch hated the\r\nJesuits as bigoted Papists and uncompromising schismatics, several\r\nof the Jesuit Fathers, who were appointed Archbishops of Cranganur,\r\nnever set foot within their diocese, and such of them as accepted the\r\nresponsibility confined themselves to the territories of the Raja of\r\nTravancore. It was only after the establishment of British supremacy\r\nthat the Jesuit Fathers were able to re-enter the scene of their early\r\nlabours. An almost unbroken line of Carmelite Fathers appointed by the\r\nPope filled the Vicariate till 1875, though the Archbishop of Goa and\r\nthe Bishop of Cochin now and then declined to consecrate the nominee,\r\nand thus made feeble attempts on behalf of their Faithful King to\r\nrecover their lost position.\r\n\r\nSalvador, S.J., Archbishop of Cranganur, died in 1777. Five years\r\nafter this, the King of Portugal appointed Joseph Cariatil and\r\nThomas Paramakal, two native Christians, who had been educated at\r\nthe Propaganda College at Rome, as Archbishop and Vicar-General,\r\nrespectively, of the diocese of Cranganur.\r\n\r\nThe native clergy at the time were mostly ignorant, and the discipline\r\namongst them was rather lax. The Propaganda attempted reforms in this\r\ndirection, which led to a rupture between the Latin and the native\r\nclergy. The Carmelite Fathers, like the Jesuits, had grown overbearing\r\nand haughty, and an attempt at innovation made by the Pope through\r\nthem became altogether distasteful to the natives. Serious charges\r\nagainst the Carmelites were, therefore, formally laid before the\r\nPope and the Raja of Travancore by the Syrians. They also insisted\r\nthat Thomas should be consecrated Bishop. At this time, the Dutch\r\nwere all-powerful at the courts of native rulers, and, though the\r\nCarmelite missionaries who had ingratiated themselves into the good\r\ngraces of the Dutch tried their best to thwart the Syrians in their\r\nendeavours, Thomas was permitted to be consecrated Bishop, and the\r\nSyrians were allowed the enjoyment of certain rare privileges. It\r\nis remarkable that, at this time and even in much earlier times,\r\nthe disputes between the foreign and the native clergy, or between\r\nthe various factions following the lead of the native clergy, were\r\noften decided by the Hindu kings, and the Christians accepted and\r\nabided by the decisions of their temporal heads.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Pope Gregory XVI issued a Bull abolishing the Sees of\r\nCranganur and Cochin, and transferring the jurisdiction to the Vicar\r\nApostolic of Varapuzha. But the King of Portugal questioned the\r\nright of the Pope, and this led to serious disputes. The abolition\r\nof the smaller seminaries by Archbishop Bernardin of Varapuzha, and\r\nhis refusal to ordain candidates for Holy Orders trained in these\r\nseminaries by the Malpans or teacher-priests, caused much discontent\r\namong the Syrian Christians, and, in 1856, a large section of the\r\nSyrians applied to the Catholic Chaldæan Patriarch of Babylon for\r\na Chaldæan Bishop. This was readily responded to by the Patriarch,\r\nwho, though under the Pope, thought that he had a prescriptive right\r\nto supremacy over the Malabar Christians. Bishop Roccos was sent\r\nout to Malabar in 1861, and though, owing to the charm of novelty, a\r\nlarge section of the Christians at once joined him, a strong minority\r\nquestioned his authority, and referred the matter to the Pope. Bishop\r\nRoccos was recalled, and the Patriarch was warned by the Pope against\r\nfurther interference.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Patriarch, again acting on the notion that he had\r\nindependent jurisdiction over the Chaldæan Syrian church of Malabar,\r\nsent out Bishop Mellus to Cochin. The arrival of this Bishop in 1874\r\ncreated a distinct split among the Christians of Trichur, one faction\r\nacknowledging the supremacy of the Pope, and the other following the\r\nlead of Bishop Mellus. This open rupture had involved the two factions\r\nin a costly litigation. The adherents of Bishop Mellus contend that\r\ntheir church, ever since its foundation in 1810 or 1812, has followed\r\nthe practice, ritual, and communion of the Chaldæan church of Babylon,\r\nwithout having ever been in communion with Rome. The matter is sub\r\njudice. They are now known by the name of Chaldæan Syrians. The Pope,\r\nin the meanwhile, excommunicated Bishop Mellus, but he continued\r\nto exercise spiritual authority over his adherents independently of\r\nRome. In 1887 the Patriarch having made peace with the Pope, Bishop\r\nMellus left India, and submitted to Rome in 1889. On the departure of\r\nBishop Mellus, the Chaldæan Syrians chose Anthony Kathanar, otherwise\r\nknown as Mar Abdeso, as their Archbishop. He is said to have been\r\na Rome Syrian priest under the Archbishop of Varapuzha. It is also\r\nsaid that he visited Syria and Palestine, and received ordination\r\nfrom the anti-Roman Patriarch of Babylon. Before his death in 1900,\r\nhe ordained Mar Augustine, who, under the title of Chorepiscopus,\r\nhad assisted him in the government of the Chaldæan church, and he\r\nnow presides over the Chaldæan Syrian churches in the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Bishop Marcellinus was appointed Coadjutor to the Vicar\r\nApostolic of Varapuzha, and entrusted with the spiritual concerns\r\nof the Romo-Syrians. On his death in 1892, the Romo-Syrians were\r\nplaced under the care of two European Vicars Apostolic. We have\r\nseen how the Jesuits had made themselves odious to the native\r\nChristians, and how reluctantly the latter had submitted to their\r\nrigid discipline. We have seen, too, how the Carmelites who replaced\r\nthem, in spite of their worldly wisdom and conciliatory policy, had\r\ntheir own occasional quarrels and disputes with the native clergy and\r\ntheir congregations. From the time of the revolt at the Coonen Cross,\r\nand ever afterwards, the Christians had longed for Bishops of their\r\nown nationality, and made repeated requests for the same. For some\r\nreason or other, compliance with these requisitions was deferred for\r\nyears. Experience showed that the direct rule of foreign Bishops had\r\nfailed to secure the unanimous sympathy and hearty co-operation of the\r\npeople. The Pope was, however, convinced of the spiritual adherence of\r\nthe native clergy and congregation to Rome. In these circumstances,\r\nit was thought advisable to give the native clergy a fair trial in\r\nthe matter of local supremacy. Bishops Medlycott and Lavigne, S.J.,\r\nwho were the Vicars Apostolic of Trichur and Kottayam, were therefore\r\nwithdrawn, and, in 1896, three native Syrian priests, Father John\r\nMenacheri, Father Aloysius Pareparambil, and Father Mathew Mackil,\r\nwere consecrated by the Papal Delegate as the Vicars Apostolic of\r\nTrichur, Ernakulam, and Chenganacheri.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly of the Indian missions claimed by the Portuguese, and the\r\nfrequent disputes which disturbed the peace of the Malabar church,\r\nwere ended in 1886 by the Concordat entered into between Pope Leo\r\nXIII and the King of Portugal. The Archbishop of Goa was by this\r\nrecognised as the Patriarch of the East Indies with the Bishop of\r\nCochin as a suffragan, whose diocese in the Cochin State is confined\r\nto the seaboard taluk of Cochin. The rest of the Latin Catholics of\r\nthis State, except a small section in the Chittur taluk under the\r\nBishop of Coimbatore, are under the Archbishop of Varapuzha.\r\n\r\nSince the revolt of the Syrians at the Coonen Cross in 1653, the\r\nJacobite Syrians have been governed by native Bishops consecrated by\r\nBishops sent by the Patriarch of Antioch, or at least always received\r\nand recognised as such. In exigent circumstances, the native Bishops\r\nthemselves, before their death, consecrated their successors by the\r\nimposition of hands. Immediately after the defection, they chose\r\nArchdeacon Thomas as their spiritual leader. He was thus the first\r\nMetran or native Bishop, having been formally ordained after twelve\r\nyears of independent rule by Mar Gregory from Antioch, with whose\r\nname the revival of Jacobitism in Malabar is associated. The Metran\r\nassumed the title of Mar Thomas I. He belonged to the family that\r\ntraced its descent from the Pakalomattom family, held in high respect\r\nand great veneration as one of the Brahman families, the members of\r\nwhich are supposed to have been converted and ordained as priests\r\nby the apostle himself. Members of the same family continued to hold\r\nthe Metranship till about the year 1815, when the family is supposed\r\nto have become extinct. This hereditary succession is supposed\r\nby some to be a relic of the Nestorian practice. It may, however,\r\nbe explained in another way. The earliest converts were high-caste\r\nHindus, amongst whom an Anandravan (brother or nephew) succeeded to\r\nthe family estates and titles in pursuance of the joint family system\r\nas current in Malabar. The succession of a brother or a nephew might,\r\ntherefore, be quite as much a relic of the Hindu custom. The Metrans\r\npossessed properties. They were, therefore, interested in securing the\r\nsuccession of their Anandravans, so that their properties might not\r\npass to a different family. Mar Thomas I was succeeded by his brother\r\nMar Thomas II, on whose death his nephew became Metran under the title\r\nof Mar Thomas III. He held office only for ten days. Mar Thomas IV,\r\nwho succeeded him, presided over the church till 1728. Thomas III and\r\nIV are said to have been consecrated by Bishop John, a scholar of great\r\nrepute, who, with one Bishop Basil, came from Antioch in 1685. During\r\nthe régime of Mar Thomas IV, and of his nephew Thomas V, Mar Gabriel,\r\na Nestorian Bishop, appeared on the scene in 1708. He seems to have\r\nbeen a man without any definite creed, as he proclaimed himself a\r\nNestorian, a Jacobite, or a Romanist, according as one or the other\r\nbest suited his interests. He had his own friends and admirers among\r\nthe Syrians, with whose support he ruled over a few churches in the\r\nnorth till 1731. The consecration of Mar Thomas V by Mar Thomas IV\r\nwas felt to be invalid, and, to remedy the defect, the assistance\r\nof the Dutch was sought; but, being disappointed, the Christians had\r\nrecourse to a Jewish merchant named Ezekiel, who undertook to convey\r\ntheir message to the Patriarch of Antioch. He brought from Bassorah\r\none Mar Ivanius, who was a man of fiery temper. He interfered with\r\nthe images in the churches. This led to quarrels with the Metran,\r\nand he had forthwith to quit the State. Through the Dutch authorities\r\nat Cochin, a fresh requisition was sent to the Patriarch of Antioch,\r\nwho sent out three Bishops named Basil, John, and Gregory. Their\r\narrival caused fresh troubles, owing to the difficulty of paying the\r\nlarge sum claimed by them as passage money. In 1761, Mar Thomas V,\r\nsupposed to have died in 1765, consecrated his nephew Mar Thomas\r\nVI. About this time, Gregory consecrated one Kurilos, the leader\r\nof a faction that resisted the rule of Thomas VI. The disputes and\r\nquarrels which followed were ended with the flight of Kurilos, who\r\nfounded the See of Anjoor in the north of Cochin and became the first\r\nBishop of Tholiyur. Through the kind intercession of the Maharaja of\r\nTravancore, Thomas VI underwent formal consecration at the hands of\r\nthe Bishops from Antioch, and took the title of Dionysius I, known\r\nalso as Dionysius the Great. In 1775, the great Carmelite father Paoli\r\nvisited Mar Dionysius, and tried to persuade him to submit to Rome. It\r\nis said that he agreed to the proposal, on condition of his being\r\nrecognised as Metropolitan of all the Syrians in Malabar, but nothing\r\ncame of it. A few years after this, the struggle for supremacy between\r\nthe Dutch and the English had ended in the triumph of the latter,\r\nwho evinced a good deal of interest in the Syrian Christians, and,\r\nin 1805, the Madras Government deputed Dr. Kerr to study the history\r\nof the Malabar Church. In 1809, Dr. Buchanan visited Mar Dionysius,\r\nand broached the question of a union of the Syrian Church with\r\nthe Church of England. The proposal, however, did not find favour\r\nwith the Metropolitan, or his congregation. Mar Dionysius died in\r\n1808. Before his death, he had consecrated Thomas Kathanar as Thomas\r\nVIII. He died in 1816. His successor, Thomas IX, was weak and old,\r\nand he was displaced by Ittoop Ramban, known as Pulikot Dionysius or\r\nDionysius II. He enjoyed the confidence and good-will of Colonel Munro,\r\nthe British Resident, through whose good offices a seminary had been\r\nbuilt at Kottayam in 1813 for the education of Syrian youths. He died\r\nin 1818. Philixenos, who had succeeded Kurilos as Bishop of Tholiyur,\r\nnow consecrated Punnathara Dionysius, or Dionysius III.\r\n\r\nWe have now to refer to an important incident in the history of the\r\nJacobite Syrians. Through the influence of the British Resident,\r\nand in the hope of effecting the union proposed by Dr. Buchanan,\r\nthe Church Mission Society commenced their labours in 1816. The\r\nEnglish Missionaries began their work under favourable circumstances,\r\nand the most cordial relations existed between the Syrians and the\r\nmissionaries for some years, so much so that the latter frequently\r\nvisited the Syrian churches, and even preached sermons. On the death\r\nof Dionysius III in 1825, or as some say 1827, Cheppat Dionysius\r\nconsecrated by Mar Philixenos again, succeeded as Metropolitan under\r\nthe title of Dionysius IV. During his régime, there grew up among the\r\nSyrians a party, who suspected that the missionaries were using their\r\ninfluence with the Metropolitan, and secretly endeavouring to bring\r\nthe Syrians under the Protestant Church. The conservative party of\r\nSyrians stoutly opposed the movement. They petitioned the Patriarch of\r\nAntioch, who at once sent out a Bishop named Athanasius. On arrival\r\nin 1825, a large number of Syrians flocked to him. He even went to\r\nthe length of threatening Mar Dionysius with excommunication. But the\r\nProtestant missionaries and the British Resident came to the rescue\r\nof the Metropolitan, and exercised their influence with the ruler\r\nof Travancore, who forthwith deported Athanasius. The deportation\r\nof Athanasius strengthened the position of the missionaries. The\r\nBritish Resident, and through his influence the native ruler, often\r\nrendered them the most unqualified support. The missionaries who\r\nsuperintended the education of the Syrian students in the seminary,\r\nhaving begun to teach them doctrines contrary to those of the Jacobite\r\nChurch, the cordiality and friendship that had existed between the\r\nmissionaries and the Metropolitan gradually gave place to distrust\r\nand suspicion. The party that clung to the time-honoured traditions\r\nand practices of their church soon fanned the flame of discord, and\r\nsnapped asunder the ties of friendship that had bound the Metropolitan\r\nto the missionaries. Bishop Wilson of Calcutta proceeded to Travancore\r\nto see if a reconciliation could be effected. But his attempts in this\r\ndirection proved fruitless, because the Syrians could not accept his\r\nproposal to adopt important changes affecting their spiritual and\r\ntemporal concerns, such as doing away with prayers for the dead,\r\nthe revision of their liturgy, the management of church funds,\r\netc., and the Syrians finally parted company with the missionaries\r\nin 1838. Soon after this, disputes arose in regard to the funds and\r\nendowments of the seminary, but they were soon settled by arbitration\r\nin 1840, and the properties were divided between the Metropolitan and\r\nthe missionaries. The missionaries had friends among the Jacobites,\r\nsome of whom became members of the Church of England.\r\n\r\nThe Syrians were rather distressed, because they thought that\r\nthe consecration of their Metropolitan by Mar Philixenos was\r\ninsufficient. They therefore memorialised the Patriarch of\r\nAntioch. There grew up also a party hostile to the Metropolitan,\r\nand they sent to Antioch a Syrian Christian named Mathew. His\r\narrival at Antioch was most opportune. The Patriarch was looking\r\nout for a proper man. Mathew was therefore welcomed, and treated\r\nvery kindly. He was consecrated as Metropolitan by the Patriarch\r\nhimself in 1842, and sent out with the necessary credentials. He\r\narrived in 1843 as Metropolitan of Malankara under the title of\r\nMathew Anastatius, and advanced his claims to the headship of the\r\nChurch, but Mar Dionysius resisted him, and sent an appeal to the\r\nPatriarch of Antioch, in which he denounced Mathew as one who had\r\nenlisted his sympathies with the Protestant missionaries. Upon this,\r\nthe Patriarch sent out one Cyril with power to expel Mathew, and,\r\nwith the connivance of Mar Dionysius, Cyril cut the gordian knot by\r\nappointing himself as Metropolitan of Malabar. Disputes arising,\r\na committee was appointed to examine the claims of Athanasius and\r\nCyril. The credentials of Cyril were proved to be forged, whereupon\r\nAthanasius was duly installed in his office in 1862, and Cyril fled\r\nthe country. Cyril having failed, the Patriarch sent another Bishop\r\nnamed Stephanos, who contributed his mite towards widening the breach,\r\nand, on the British Resident having ordered the Bishop to quit the\r\ncountry, an appeal was preferred to the Court of Directors, who\r\ninsisted on a policy of non-interference. This bestirred Mar Cyril,\r\nwho reappeared on the scene, and fanned the flame of discord. Being\r\nordered to leave Mar Athanasius unmolested, he and his friends sent\r\none Joseph to Antioch, who returned with fresh credentials in 1866,\r\nassumed the title of Dionysius V, claimed the office of Metropolitan,\r\nand applied to the Travancore Government for assistance. Adopting\r\na policy of non-interference, the darbar referred him to the Law\r\nCourts, in case he could not come to terms with Mar Athanasius. The\r\nPatriarch of Antioch himself visited Cochin and Travancore in 1874,\r\nand presided over a Synod which met at Mulanthurutha in the Cochin\r\nState. Resolutions affirming the supremacy of Antioch, recognising Mar\r\nDionysius as the accredited Metropolitan of Malabar, and condemning\r\nMathew Athanasius as a schismatic, were passed by the members of the\r\nassembly, and the Patriarch returned to Mardin in 1876. This, however,\r\ndid not mend matters, and the two parties launched themselves into a\r\nprotracted law suit in 1879, which ended in favour of Mar Dionysius\r\nin 1889. Mar Athanasius, who had taken up an independent position,\r\ndied in 1875, and his cousin, whom he had consecrated, succeeded as\r\nMetropolitan under the title of Mar Thomas Anastatius. He died in\r\n1893, and Titus Mar Thoma, consecrated likewise by his predecessor,\r\npresides over the Reformed Party of Jacobite Syrians, who prefer to\r\nbe called St. Thomas' Syrians. We have thus traced the history of the\r\nJacobite Syrians from 1653, and shown how they separated themselves\r\ninto two parties, now represented by the Jacobite Syrians under\r\nMar Dionysius, owing allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch, and the\r\nReformed Syrians or St. Thomas' Syrians owning Titus Mar Thoma as their\r\nsupreme spiritual head. Thus, while the Jacobite Syrians have accepted\r\nand acknowledged the ecclesiastical supremacy of the Patriarch of\r\nAntioch, the St. Thomas' Syrians, maintaining that the Jacobite creed\r\nwas introduced into Malabar only in the seventeenth century after a\r\nsection of the church had shaken off the Roman supremacy, uphold the\r\necclesiastical autonomy of the church, whereby the supreme control\r\nof the spiritual and temporal affairs of the church is declared to be\r\nin the hands of the Metropolitan of Malabar. The St. Thomas' Syrians\r\nhold that the consecration of a Bishop by, or with the sanction of the\r\nPatriarch of Babylon, Alexandria or Antioch, gives no more validity\r\nor sanctity to that office than consecration by the Metropolitan of\r\nMalabar, the supreme head of the church in Malabar, inasmuch as this\r\nchurch is as ancient and apostolic as any other, being founded by the\r\napostle St. Thomas; while the Jacobites hold that the consecration of\r\na Bishop is not valid, unless it be done with the sanction of their\r\nPatriarch. The St. Thomas' Syrians have, however, no objection to\r\nreceiving consecration from the head of any other episcopal apostolic\r\nchurch, but they consider that such consecrations do not in any way\r\nsubject their church to the supremacy of that prelate or church.\r\n\r\nBoth the Latins and the Romo-Syrians use the liturgy of the Church\r\nof Rome, the former using the Latin, and the latter the Syriac\r\nlanguage. It is believed by some that the Christians of St. Thomas\r\nformerly used the liturgy of St. Adæus, East Syrian, Edessa, but that\r\nit was almost completely assimilated to the Roman liturgy by Portuguese\r\nJesuits at the Synod of Diamper in 1599. The Chaldæan Syrians also use\r\nthe Roman liturgy, with the following points of difference in practice,\r\ncommunicated to me by their present ecclesiastical head:--(1) They\r\nperform marriage ceremonies on Sundays, instead of week days as the\r\nRomo-Syrians do. (2) While reading the Gospel, their priests turn\r\nto the congregation, whereas the Romo-Syrian priests turn to the\r\naltar. (3) Their priests bless the congregation in the middle of\r\nthe mass, a practice not in vogue among the Romo-Syrians. (4) They\r\nuse two kinds of consecrated oil in baptism, which does away with\r\nthe necessity of confirmation. The Romo-Syrians, on the other hand,\r\nuse only one kind of oil, and hence they have to be subsequently\r\nconfirmed by one of their Bishops.\r\n\r\nThe liturgy used by the Jacobite Syrians and the St. Thomas' Syrians\r\nis the same, viz., that of St. James. The St. Thomas' Syrians have,\r\nhowever, made some changes by deleting certain passages from it. [A\r\nrecent writer observes that \"a service which I attended at the quaint\r\nold Syrian church at Kottayam, which glories in the possession of\r\none of the three ancient stone crosses in India, closely resembled,\r\nas far as my memory serves me, one which I attended many years ago at\r\nAntioch, except that the non-sacramental portions of the mass were\r\nread in Malayalam instead of in Arabic, the sacramental words alone\r\nbeing in both cases spoken in the ancient Syriac tongue.] In regard to\r\ndoctrine and practice, the following points may be noted:--(1) While\r\nthe Jacobite Syrians look upon the Holy Bible as the main authority in\r\nmatters of doctrine, practice, and ritual, they do not allow the Bible\r\nto be interpreted except with the help of the traditions of the church,\r\nthe writings of the early Fathers, and the decrees of the Holy Synods\r\nof the undivided Christian period; but the St. Thomas' Syrians believe\r\nthat the Holy Bible is unique and supreme in such matters. (2) While\r\nthe Jacobites have faith in the efficacy and necessity of prayers,\r\ncharities, etc., for the benefit of departed souls, of the invocation\r\nof the Virgin Mary and the Saints in divine worship, of pilgrimages,\r\nand of confessing sins to, and obtaining absolution from priests, the\r\nSt. Thomas' Syrians regard these and similar practices as unscriptural,\r\ntending not to the edification of believers, but to the drawing away\r\nof the minds of believers from the vital and real spiritual truths\r\nof the Christian Revelation. (3) While the Jacobites administer the\r\nLord's Supper to the laity and the non-celebrating clergy in the\r\nform of consecrated bread dipped in consecrated wine, and regard it\r\na sin to administer the elements separately after having united them\r\nin token of Christ's resurrection, the St. Thomas' Syrians admit\r\nthe laity to both the elements after the act of uniting them. (4)\r\nWhile the Jacobite Syrians allow marriage ceremonies on Sundays,\r\non the plea that, being of the nature of a sacrament, they ought to\r\nbe celebrated on Sundays, and that Christ himself had taken part in a\r\nmarriage festival on the Sabbath day, the St. Thomas' Syrians prohibit\r\nsuch celebrations on Sundays as unscriptural, the Sabbath being\r\nset apart for rest and religious exercises. (5) While the Jacobites\r\nbelieve that the mass is as much a memorial of Christ's oblation on\r\nthe cross as it is an unbloody sacrifice offered for the remission\r\nof the sins of the living and of the faithful dead, the St. Thomas'\r\nSyrians observe it as a commemoration of Christ's sacrifice on the\r\ncross. (6) The Jacobites venerate the cross and the relics of Saints,\r\nwhile the St. Thomas' Syrians regard the practice as idolatry. (7)\r\nThe Jacobites perform mass for the dead, while the St. Thomas' Syrians\r\nregard it as unscriptural. (8) With the Jacobites, remarriage, marriage\r\nof widows, and marriage after admission to full priesthood, reduce a\r\npriest to the status of a layman, and one united in any such marriage\r\nis not permitted to perform priestly functions, whereas priests of\r\nthe St. Thomas' Syrian party are allowed to contract such marriages\r\nwithout forfeiture of their priestly rights. (9) The Jacobite Syrians\r\nbelieve in the efficacy of infant baptism, and acknowledge baptismal\r\nregeneration, while the St. Thomas' Syrians, who also baptise infants,\r\ndeny the doctrine of regeneration in baptism, and regard the ceremony\r\nas a mere external sign of admission to church communion. (10) The\r\nJacobites observe special fasts, and abstain from certain articles\r\nof food during such fasts, while the St. Thomas' Syrians regard the\r\npractice as superstitious.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite Syrian priests are not paid any fixed salary, but are\r\nsupported by voluntary contributions in the shape of fees for baptism,\r\nmarriages, funerals, etc. The Romo-Syrian and Latin priests are paid\r\nfixed salaries, besides the above perquisites. The Syrian priests\r\nare called Kathanars, while the Latin priests go by the name of\r\nPadres. For the Jacobite Syrians, the morone or holy oil required\r\nfor baptism, consecration of churches, ordination of priests, etc.,\r\nhas to be obtained from Antioch. The churches under Rome get it from\r\nRome. Unlike the Catholic clergy, the Jacobite clergy, except their\r\nMetropolitan and the Rambans, are allowed to marry.\r\n\r\nThe generality of Syrians of the present day trace their descent from\r\nthe higher orders of the Hindu society, and the observance by many of\r\nthem of certain customs prevalent more or less among high-caste Hindus\r\nbears out this fact. It is no doubt very curious that, in spite of\r\ntheir having been Christians for centuries together, they still retain\r\nthe traditions of their Hindu forefathers. It may sound very strange,\r\nbut it is none the less true, that caste prejudices which influence\r\ntheir Hindu brethren in all social and domestic relations obtain\r\nto some extent among some sections of the Syrian Christians, but,\r\nwith the spread of a better knowledge of the teachings of Christ, the\r\nprogress of English education, and contact with European Christians,\r\ncaste observances are gradually dying out. The following relics of\r\nold customs may, however, be noted:--\r\n\r\n(1) Some Christians make offerings to Hindu temples with as much\r\nreverence as they do in their own churches.\r\n\r\nSome non-Brahman Hindus likewise make offerings to Christian churches.\r\n\r\n(2) Some sections of Syrians have faith in horoscopes, and get them\r\ncast for new-born babies, just as Hindus do.\r\n\r\n(3) On the wedding day, the bridegroom ties round the neck of the bride\r\na tali (small ornament made of gold). This custom is prevalent among\r\nall classes of Native Christians. On the death of their husbands,\r\nsome even remove the tali to indicate widowhood, as is the custom\r\namong the Brahmans.\r\n\r\n(4) When a person dies, his or her children, if any, and near\r\nrelatives, observe pula (death pollution) for a period ranging from\r\nten to fifteen days. The observance imposes abstinence from animal\r\nfood. The pula ends with a religious ceremony in the church, with\r\nfeasting friends and relatives in the house, and feeding the poor,\r\naccording to one's means. Sradha, or anniversary ceremony for the soul\r\nof the dead, is performed with services in the church and feasts in\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n(5) In rural parts especially, the Onam festival of the Malayali\r\nHindus is celebrated with great éclat, with feasting, making presents\r\nof cloths to children and relatives, out-door and in-door games, etc.\r\n\r\n(6) Vishu, or new-year's day, is likewise a gala day, when presents\r\nof small coins are made to children, relatives, and the poor.\r\n\r\n(7) The ceremony of first feeding a child with rice (annaprasanam\r\nor chorunu of the Hindus) is celebrated generally in the sixth month\r\nafter birth. Parents often make vows to have the ceremony done in a\r\nparticular church, as Hindu parents take their children to particular\r\ntemples in fulfilment of special vows.\r\n\r\n(8) The Syrians do not admit within their premises low-castes, e.g.,\r\nPulayans, Paraiyans, etc., even after the conversion of the latter\r\nto Christianity. They enforce even distance pollution, though not\r\nquite to the same extent as Malayali Hindus do. Iluvans are allowed\r\nadmission to their houses, but are not allowed to cook their meals. In\r\nsome parts, they are not even allowed to enter the houses of Syrians.\r\n\r\nThere are no intermarriages between Syrians of the various\r\ndenominations and Latin Catholics. Under very exceptional\r\ncircumstances, a Romo-Syrian contracts a marriage with one of\r\nLatin rite, and vice versâ, but this entails many difficulties\r\nand disabilities on the issues. Among the Latins themselves, there\r\nare, again, no intermarriages between the communities of the seven\r\nhundred, the five hundred, and the three hundred. The difference of\r\ncult and creed has led to the prohibition of marriages between the\r\nRomo-Syrians and Jacobite Syrians. The Jacobite Syrians properly so\r\ncalled, St. Thomas' Syrians, and the Syro-Protestants do, however,\r\nintermarry. The Southerners and Northerners do not intermarry; any\r\nconjugal ties effected between them subject the former to some kind of\r\nsocial excommunication. This exclusiveness, as we have already said,\r\nis claimed on the score of their descent from the early colonists\r\nfrom Syria. The Syrians in general, and the Jacobite Syrians in\r\nparticular, are greater stricklers to customs than other classes of\r\nNative Christians.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the privileges granted to the Syrians by\r\nthe Hindu kings in early times. They not only occupied a very high\r\nposition in the social scale, but also enjoyed at different times the\r\nrare distinction of forming a section of the body-guard of the king and\r\nthe militia of the country. Education has of late made great progress\r\namong them. The public service has now been thrown open to them, so\r\nthat those who have had the benefit of higher education now hold some\r\nof the important posts in the State. In enterprises of all kinds, they\r\nare considerably ahead of their Hindu and Musalman brethren, so that\r\nwe see them take very kindly to commerce, manufacture, agriculture,\r\netc.; in fact, in every walk of life, they are making their mark by\r\ntheir industry and enterprise. [209]\r\n\r\nThe following additional information is contained in the Gazetteer of\r\nMalabar. \"The men are to be distinguished by the small cross worn round\r\nthe neck, and the women by their tali, which has 21 beads on it, set\r\nin the form of a cross. Their churches are ugly rectangular buildings\r\nwith flat or arched wooden roofs and whitewashed facades. They have no\r\nspire, but the chancel, which is at the east end, is usually somewhat\r\nhigher than the nave. Between the chancel and the body of the church\r\nis a curtain, which is drawn while the priest consecrates the elements\r\nat the mass. Right and left of the chancel are two rooms, the vestry\r\nand the sacristy. At the west end is a gallery, in which the unmarried\r\npriests sometimes live. Most churches contain three altars, one in the\r\nchancel, and the other two at its western ends on each side. There are\r\nno images in Jacobite or Reformed churches, but there are sometimes\r\npictures. Crucifixes are placed on the altars, and in other parts of\r\nthe churches. The clergy and men of influence are buried in the nave\r\njust outside the chancel. The Syrian Bishops are called Metrans. They\r\nare celibates, and live on the contributions of their churches. They\r\nwear purple robes and black silk cowls figured with golden crosses, a\r\nbig gold cross round the neck, and a ring on the fourth finger of the\r\nright hand. Bishops are nominated by their predecessors from the body\r\nof Rambans, who are men selected by priests and elders in advance to\r\nfill the Episcopate. Metrans are buried in their robes in a sitting\r\nposture. Their priests are called Cattanars. They should strictly\r\npass through the seven offices of ostiary, reader, exorcist, acolyte,\r\nsub-deacon and deacon before becoming priests; but the first three\r\noffices practically no longer exist. The priestly office is often\r\nhereditary, descending by the marumakkattayam system (inheritance\r\nin the female line). Jacobite and St. Thomas' Syrian priests are\r\npaid by contributions from their parishioners, fees at weddings,\r\nand the like. Their ordinary dress consists of white trousers, and\r\na kind of long white shirt with short sleeves and a flap hanging\r\ndown behind, supposed to be in the form of a cross. Over this the\r\nJacobites now wear a black coat. Priests are allowed to marry, except\r\nin the Romo-Syrian community; but, among the Jacobites, a priest may\r\nnot marry after he has once been ordained, nor may he re-marry or\r\nmarry a widow. Malpans, or teachers, are the heads of the religious\r\ncolleges, where priests are trained. Jacobites also now shave clean,\r\nwhile other Syrian priests wear the tonsure. Every church has not\r\nmore than four Kaikkars or churchwardens, who are elected from the\r\nbody of parishioners. They are the trustees of the church property,\r\nand, with the priest, constitute a disciplinary body, which exercises\r\nconsiderable powers in religious and social matters over the members\r\nof the congregation. The Romo-Syrians follow the doctrines and ritual\r\nof the Roman Catholics, but they use a Syriac version [210] of the\r\nLatin liturgy. Jacobites and St. Thomas' Christians use the Syriac\r\nliturgy of St. James. Few even of the priests understand Syriac, and,\r\nin the Reformed Syrian churches, a Malayalam translation of the Syriac\r\nliturgy has now been generally adopted. The Jacobites say masses for\r\nthe dead, but do not believe in purgatory; they invoke the Virgin\r\nMary, venerate the cross and relics of saints; they recognise only\r\nthree sacraments, baptism, marriage (which they always celebrate on\r\nSundays) and the mass; they prescribe auricular confession before\r\nmass, and at the mass administer the bread dipped in the wine; they\r\nrecite the Eastern form of the Nicene Creed, and discourage laymen\r\nfrom studying the Bible. The Reformed Syrians differ from them in\r\nmost of these points. The Jacobites observe the ordinary festivals of\r\nthe church; the day of the patron saint of each church is celebrated\r\nwith special pomp, and on the offerings made on that day the priests\r\nlargely depend for their income. They keep Lent, which they call the\r\nfifty days' fast, strictly from the Sunday before Ash Wednesday,\r\nabjuring all meat, fish, ghee, and toddy; and on Maundy Thursday\r\nthey eat a special kind of unsweetened cake marked with a cross, in\r\nthe centre of which the karnavan of the family should drive a nail,\r\nand drink a kanji of rice and cocoanut-milk (the meal is said to\r\nsymbolize the Passover and the Last Supper, and the nail is supposed\r\nto be driven into the eye of Judas Iscariot).\r\n\r\n\"Amongst the Syrian Christians, as amongst the Mappillas, there\r\nare many survivals of Hindu customs and superstitions, and caste\r\nprejudices have by no means disappeared amongst the various sections\r\nof the community. Southerners and Northerners will not intermarry,\r\nand families who trace their descent from Brahmans and Nayars will, in\r\nmany cases, not admit lower classes to their houses, much less allow\r\nthem to cook for them or touch them. Most of the Syrians observe the\r\nOnam and Vishnu festivals; the astrologer is frequently consulted to\r\ncast horoscopes and tell omens; while it is a common custom for persons\r\nsuffering from diseases to seek a cure by buying silver or tin images\r\nof the diseased limb, which their priest has blessed. Similar survivals\r\nare to be noticed in their social ceremonies. A Pulikudi ceremony,\r\nsimilar to that of the Hindus, was commonly performed till recently,\r\nthough it has now fallen into disuse. Immediately on the birth of a\r\nchild, three drops of honey in which gold has been rubbed are poured\r\ninto its mouth by its father, and the mother is considered to be under\r\npollution till the tenth day. Baptism takes place on the fourteenth\r\nday amongst the Southern Jacobites, and amongst other divisions on\r\nthe fifty-sixth day. A rice-giving ceremony similar to the Hindu\r\nChorunnu is still sometimes performed in the fifth or sixth month,\r\nwhen the child is presented by the mother with a gold cross, if a boy,\r\nor a small gold coin or taluvam if a girl, to be worn round the neck.\r\n\r\n\"Among the Jacobites early marriage was the rule until comparatively\r\nrecently, boys being married at ten or twelve years of age, and girls\r\nat six or seven. Now the more usual age for marriage is sixteen in the\r\ncase of boys, and twelve in the case of girls. Weddings take place on\r\nSundays, and, amongst the Northerners, may be celebrated in either\r\nthe bride's or the bridegroom's parish church. On the two Sundays\r\nbefore the wedding, the banns have to be called in the two churches,\r\nand the marriage agreements concluded in the presence of the parish\r\npriests (Ottu kalyanam). The dowry, which is an essential feature of\r\nSyrian weddings, is usually paid on the Sunday before the wedding. It\r\nshould consist of an odd number of rupees, and should be tied up in a\r\ncloth. On the Thursday before the wedding day, the house is decorated\r\nwith rice flour, and on the Saturday the marriage pandal (booth), is\r\nbuilt. The first ceremonial takes place on Saturday night when bride\r\nand bridegroom both bathe, and the latter is shaved. Next morning\r\nboth bride and bridegroom attend the ordinary mass, the bridegroom\r\nbeing careful to enter the church before the bride. Now-a-days\r\nboth are often dressed more or less in European fashion, and it\r\nis essential that the bride should wear as many jewels as she has\r\ngot, or can borrow for the occasion. Before leaving his house,\r\nthe bridegroom is blessed by his guru to whom he gives a present\r\n(dakshina) of clothes and money. He is accompanied by a bestman,\r\nusually his sister's husband, who brings the tali. After mass,\r\na tithe (pathuvaram) of the bride's dowry is paid to the church as\r\nthe marriage fee, a further fee to the priest (kaikasturi), and a fee\r\ncalled kaimuttupanam for the bishop. The marriage service is then read,\r\nand, at its conclusion, the bridegroom ties the tali round the bride's\r\nneck with threads taken from her veil, making a special kind of knot,\r\nwhile the priest holds the tali in front. The priest and the bridegroom\r\nthen put a veil (mantravadi) over the bride's head. The tali should\r\nnot be removed so long as the girl is married, and should be buried\r\nwith her. The veil should also be kept for her funeral. The bridal\r\nparty returns home in state, special umbrellas being held over the\r\nbride and bridegroom. At the gate they are met by the bride's sister\r\ncarrying a lighted lamp, and she washes the bridegroom's feet. The\r\nmarried couple then go to the pandal, where they are ceremonially\r\nfed with sweets and plantains by the priest and by representatives\r\nof their two families, to the accompaniment of the women's kurava\r\n(cry), and in the presence of the guests, who are seated in order of\r\nprecedence, the chief persons having seats of honour covered with\r\nblack rugs and white cloths (vellayum karimbadavum), traditionally\r\na regal honour. The bride and bridegroom are then led into the house\r\nby the bestman and bride's uncle, the bride being careful to enter it\r\nright foot first; and the guests are feasted in order of rank. It is\r\na peculiar custom of the Syrian Christians at these feasts to double\r\nup the ends of the plantain leaves which serve them as plates, and\r\nis supposed to be symbolical of the royal privilege of eating off a\r\ndouble plate. Until the following Wednesday, the bestman sleeps with\r\nthe bridegroom in the bridal chamber, the bride occupying another\r\nroom. On Wednesday evening comes the ceremony called nalam kuli,\r\nor fourth day bath. The bridegroom and the bestman, who are in the\r\nbridal chamber, lock the door; the bride's mother knocks and begs the\r\nbridegroom to come out, which he at last does after she has sung a\r\nsong (vathilturapattu) celebrating the attractions and virtues of the\r\nbride. The bridegroom and bride then bathe, dress in new clothes,\r\nand go to the pandal, where they perform paradakshinams round a\r\nlighted lamp, and the bridegroom gives cloths to the bride's uncle,\r\nmother, and grand-parents. The married couple are then escorted to the\r\nbridal chamber, which has in the interval been cleaned and prepared for\r\nthem. The next morning they have to go to the bridegroom's or bride's\r\nhouse as the case may be, and there eat together and go through a\r\nceremonial similar to that which they performed on the wedding day\r\nin the other house. This concludes the marriage ceremonies, but on\r\nSunday the bridegroom and bride should attend mass together in the\r\nbride's parish church if they were married in the bridegroom's, and\r\nvice versâ. Amongst the Southern Jacobites, the ceremonies are very\r\nsimilar, but the dowry is not paid till the marriage day, or till the\r\ngirl's first confinement. Half the pathuvaram is paid to the priest\r\ninstead of a kaikasturi, and the bridegroom puts a ring on the bride's\r\nfinger during the marriage service. After the church service, the\r\ncouple go to the bridegroom's house, where they are fed ceremonially\r\nby the bride's mother, and the subsequent feast is at the expense of\r\nthe bride's people. On Monday morning, the bridegroom is ceremonially\r\nfed by the bride's mother in the bridal chamber (manavalan choru),\r\nand in the evening there is a ceremony called manavalan tazhukkal, in\r\nwhich the bride and bridegroom are embraced in turn by their respective\r\nparents and relations, after which there is a feast with singing of\r\nhymns. Before the couple leave for the bride's house on Thursday,\r\nthere is a big feast, called kudivirunnu, given by the bridegroom to\r\nthe bride's people, followed by a ceremony called vilakku toduga, in\r\nwhich men and women sing hymns and dance round a lighted lamp, which\r\nthey touch at intervals. Amongst the Romo-Syrians and the Reformed\r\nsect, the marriage ceremonies have less trace of Hindu ritual; they\r\ndo not celebrate weddings on Sundays, and have no nalam kuli ceremony,\r\nbut a tali is usually tied in addition to the giving of a ring.\r\n\r\n\"At funerals (except amongst the Reformed sect) it is usual for\r\neach of the dead man's connections to bring a cloth to serve as\r\na shroud. Before the body is lowered into the grave, holy oil is\r\npoured into the eyes, nostrils and ears. The mourners are under\r\npollution, and fast till the day of the second funeral or pula kuli\r\n(purification), and till then masses should be said daily for the\r\ndead. The pula kuli is celebrated usually on the 11th day, but\r\nmay be deferred till the 15th, 17th or 21st, or sometimes to the\r\n41st. The mourners are incensed, while hymns are sung and prayers\r\noffered. Each then gives a contribution of money to the priest,\r\nand receives in return a pinch of cummin. A feast is then given to\r\nthe neighbours and the poor. On the 40th day there is another feast,\r\nat which meat is eaten by the mourners for the first time. A requiem\r\nmass should be said each month on the day of death for twelve months,\r\nand on the first anniversary the mourning concludes with a feast.\"\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing account of the Syrian Christians, a few stray notes\r\nmay be added.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded by Sir M. E. Grant Duff, formerly Governor of Madras,\r\n[211] that \"the interesting body known as the Syrian Christians or\r\nChristians of St. Thomas is divided into several groups much opposed\r\nto each other. In an excellent address presented to me they said\r\nthat this was the occasion which, for the first time after ages of\r\nseparation, witnessed the spectacle of all the different sects of\r\ntheir community, following divergent articles of faith, sinking for\r\nonce their religious differences to do honour to their friend.\"\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the wife of a District Judge of Calicut asked the\r\npupils of a school how long they had been Christians. \"We were,\" came\r\nthe crushing reply, \"Christians when you English were worshipping\r\nDruids, and stained with woad.\" More recently, the master at a\r\ncollege in Madras called on all Native Christians in his class to\r\nstand up. Noticing that one boy remained seated, he called on him\r\nfor an explanation, when the youth explained that he was a Syrian\r\nChristian, and not a Native Christian.\r\n\r\nIt is noted by the Rev. W. J. Richards that \"at the very time that\r\nour King John was pulling out Jews' teeth to make them surrender\r\ntheir treasures, Hindu princes were protecting Jewish and Christian\r\nsubjects, whose ancestors had been honoured by Royal grants for\r\nhundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southerners say that they can be distinguished from the Northerners\r\nby the red tinge of their hair. A man with reddish moustache, and\r\na dark-skinned baby with brilliant red hair, whose father had red\r\nwhiskers, were produced before me in support of the claim.\r\n\r\nAs examples of Old and New Testament names occurring, in a changed\r\nform, among Syrian Christians, the following may be cited:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abraham, Abragam.\r\n    Joshua, Koshi.\r\n    Peter, Puthros, Ittiyerah, Itte.\r\n    Paul, Powlos.\r\n    John, Yohan, Sonanan, Chona.\r\n    Titus, Tetos.\r\n    Matthew, Mathai, Mathen.\r\n    Philip, Philippos, Papi, Eippe, Eapen.\r\n    Thomas, Thoma, Thommi, Thommen.\r\n    Joseph, Ouseph.\r\n    Jacob, Yacob, Chako\r\n    Alexander, Chandi.\r\n    Samuel, Chamuel.\r\n    Mary, Maria, Mariam.\r\n    Sarah, Sara.\r\n    Susannah, Sosa.\r\n    Rebecca, Rabka, Raca.\r\n    Elizabeth, Elspeth, Elia, Elacha.\r\n    Rachael, Rachi, Raghael, Chacha.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyrian Christians take the name of their father, their own name, and\r\nthat of their residence. Whence arise such names as Edazayhikkal Mathoo\r\nPhilippos, Kunnampuram Thommen Chandi, and Chandakadayil Joseph Chommi.\r\n\r\nI have seen some Syrian Christian men tattooed with a cross on the\r\nupper arm, and a cross and their initials on the forearm.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may, for the sake of comparison, place on record the\r\naverages of the more important physical measurements of Northerner\r\nand Southerner Syrian Christians and Nayars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        30 Syrian             40 Nayars.\r\n                        Christians.\r\n                                        Northerner.   Southerner.\r\n     Stature                 165.3         164.8         165.2\r\n     Cephalic length          18.7          18.9          18.7\r\n     Cephalic breadth         14.3          14.1          13.9\r\n     Cephalic index           76.3          74.8          74.4\r\n     Nasal height              4.9           4.9           4.9\r\n     Nasal breadth             3.5           3.5           3.5\r\n     Nasal index              72.3          71.6          71.1\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that, in his 'Letters from Malabar,' Canter Visscher,\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth century, writes that the St. Thomas'\r\nChristians \"keep very strict genealogical records, and they will\r\nneither marry nor in any way intermingle with the new low-caste\r\nChristians, being themselves mostly Castade Naiross, that is, nobility\r\nof the Nayar caste, in token of which they generally carry a sword\r\nin the hand, as a mark of dignity.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated by E. Petersen and F. V. Luschan [212] that \"probably a\r\nsingle people originally occupied the greater part of Asia Minor. They\r\nare still represented as a compact group by the Armenians. The type\r\nresembles the Dissentis type of His and Rütimeyer; the head extremely\r\nshort and high, stature moderate, skin dark, eyes dark, and hair dark\r\nand smooth. It extends through the S. half of Asia Minor, N.E. to\r\nthe Caucasus, and E. to the Upper Euphrates. The Tachtadschy people,\r\na hill people living without serious mixture with other peoples,\r\ngive measurements closely like the Armenians.\" [The cephalic index\r\nof Armenians is given by E. Chantre [213] as 85-86.]\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the averages of some of the more important\r\nmeasurements of the Syrian Christians and Tachtadschy people are\r\nrecorded:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Stature,   Cephalic      Cephalic   Cephalic,\r\n                    cm.        length, cm.   breadth,   index.\r\n                                             cm.\r\n\r\n      Syrian           165.3          18.7       14.3        76.3\r\n      Christians,\r\n      Northerner\r\n      Syrian           164.8          18.9       14.1        74.8\r\n      Christians,\r\n      Southerner\r\n      Tachtadschy      168.           17.9       15.3        85.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Manual of the North Arcot district.\r\n\r\n[2] Pulikesin II, the Chalukyan King of Badami.\r\n\r\n[3] Manual of the Madura district.\r\n\r\n[4] South Indian Inscriptions, III, 31, page 82.\r\n\r\n[5] In the Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras.\r\n\r\n[6] J.
