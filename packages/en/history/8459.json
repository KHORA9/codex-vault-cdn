They did not converse. They\r\ndiscoursed. They talked sententiously in portentous essays and learned\r\ndissertations. I used to think it great, though I nursed no little dislike\r\nof Sumner.\r\n\r\nCharles Eames was at the outset of his career a ne'er-do-well New\r\nEnglander--a Yankee Jack-of-all-trades--kept at the front by an exceedingly\r\nclever wife. Through the favor she enjoyed at court he received from Pierce\r\nand Buchanan unimportant diplomatic appointments. During their sojourns in\r\nWashington their home was a kind of political and literary headquarters.\r\nMrs. Eames had established a salon--the first attempt of the kind made\r\nthere; and it was altogether a success. Her Sundays evenings were notable,\r\nindeed. Whoever was worth seeing, if in town, might usually be found there.\r\nCharles Sumner led the procession. He was a most imposing person. Both\r\nhandsome and distinguished in appearance, he possessed in an eminent degree\r\nthe Harvard pragmatism--or, shall I say, affectation?--and seemed never\r\nhappy except on exhibition. He had made a profitable political and personal\r\nissue of the Preston Brooks attack. Brooks was an exceeding light weight,\r\nbut he did for Sumner more than Sumner could ever have done for himself.\r\n\r\nIn the Charles Eames days Sumner was exceedingly disagreeable to me. Many\r\npeople, indeed, thought him so. Many years later, in the Greeley campaign\r\nof 1872, Schurz brought us together--they had become as very brothers in\r\nthe Senate--and I found him the reverse of my boyish ill conceptions.\r\n\r\nHe was a great old man. He was a delightful old man, every inch a\r\nstatesman, much of a scholar, and something of a hero. I grew in time to be\r\nactually fond of him, passed with him entire afternoons and evenings in his\r\nlibrary, mourned sincerely when he died, and went with Schurz to Boston, on\r\nthe occasion when that great German-American delivered the memorial address\r\nin honor of the dead Abolitionist.\r\n\r\nOf all the public men of that period Carl Schurz most captivated me. When\r\nwe first came into personal relations, at the Liberal Convention, which\r\nassembled at Cincinnati and nominated Greeley and Brown as a presidential\r\nticket, he was just turned forty-three; I, two and thirty. The closest\r\nintimacy followed. Our tastes were much alike. Both of us had been educated\r\nin music. He played the piano with intelligence and feeling--especially\r\nSchumann, Brahms and Mendelssohn, neither of us ever having quite reached\r\nthe \"high jinks\" of Wagner.\r\n\r\nTo me his oratory was wonderful. He spoke to an audience of five or ten\r\nthousand as he would have talked to a party of three or six. His style was\r\nsimple, natural, unstrained; the lucid statement and cogent argument now\r\nand again irradiated by a salient passage of satire or a burst of not too\r\neloquent rhetoric.\r\n\r\nHe was quite knocked out by the nomination of Horace Greeley. For a long\r\ntime he could not reconcile himself to support the ticket. Horace White and\r\nI addressed ourselves to the task of \"fetching him into camp\"--there being\r\nin point of fact nowhere else for him to go--though we had to get up what\r\nwas called The Fifth Avenue Conference to make a bridge.\r\n\r\nTruth to say, Schurz never wholly adjusted himself to political conditions\r\nin the United States. He once said to me in one of the querulous moods that\r\nsometimes overcame him: \"If I should live a hundred years my enemies would\r\nstill call me a--Dutchman!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Schurz, as I have said, who brought Lamar and me together. The\r\nMississippian had been a Secession Member of Congress when I was a Unionist\r\nscribe in the reporters' gallery. I was a furious partisan in those\r\ndays and disliked the Secessionists intensely. Of them, Lamar was most\r\naggressive. I later learned that he was very many-sided and accomplished,\r\nthe most interesting and lovable of men. He and Schurz \"froze together,\"\r\nas, brought together by Schurz, he and I \"froze together.\" On one side he\r\nwas a sentimentalist and on the other a philosopher, but on all sides a\r\nfighter.\r\n\r\nThey called him a dreamer. He sprang from a race of chevaliers and\r\nscholars. Oddly enough, albeit in his moods a recluse, he was a man of\r\nthe world; a favorite in society; very much at home in European courts,\r\nespecially in that of England; the friend of Thackeray, at whose house,\r\nwhen in London, he made his abode. Lady Ritchie--Anne Thackeray--told me\r\nmany amusing stories of his whimsies. He was a man among brainy men and a\r\nlion among clever women.\r\n\r\nWe had already come to be good friends and constant comrades when the\r\nwhirligig of time threw us together for a little while in the lower house\r\nof Congress. One day he beckoned me over to his seat. He was leaning\r\nbackward with his hands crossed behind his head.\r\n\r\nAs I stood in front of him he said: \"On the eighth of February, 1858, Mrs.\r\nGwin, of California, gave a fancy dress ball. Mr. Lamar, of Mississippi,\r\na member of Congress, was there. Also a glorious young woman--a vision of\r\nbeauty and grace--with whom the handsome and distinguished young statesman\r\ndanced--danced once, twice, thrice, taking her likewise down to supper.\r\nHe went to bed, turned his face to the wall and dreamed of her. That was\r\ntwenty years ago. To-day this same Mr. Lamar, after an obscure interregnum,\r\nwas with Mrs. Lamar looking over Washington for an apartment. In quest of\r\ncheap lodging they came to a mean house in a mean quarter, where a poor,\r\nwizened, ill-clad woman showed them through the meanly furnished rooms. Of\r\ncourse they would not suffice.\r\n\r\n\"As they were coming away the great Mr. Lamar said to the poor landlady,\r\n'Madam, have you lived long in Washington?' She said all her life. 'Madam,'\r\nhe continued, 'were you at a fancy dress ball given by Mrs. Senator Gwin\r\nof California, the eighth of February, 1858?' She said she was. 'Do you\r\nremember,' the statesman, soldier and orator continued, 'a young and\r\nhandsome Mississippian, a member of Congress, by the name of Lamar?' She\r\nsaid she didn't.\"\r\n\r\nI rather think that Lamar was the biggest brained of all the men I have met\r\nin Washington. He possessed the courage of his convictions. A doctrinaire,\r\nthere was nothing of the typical doctrinaire, or theorist, about him. He\r\nreally believed that cotton was king and would compel England to espouse\r\nthe cause of the South.\r\n\r\nDespite his wealth of experience and travel he was not overmuch of a\r\nraconteur, but he once told me a good story about his friend Thackeray. The\r\ntwo were driving to a banquet of the Literary Fund, where Dickens was to\r\npreside. \"Lamar,\" said Thackeray, \"they say I can't speak. But if I want to\r\nI can speak. I can speak every bit as good as Dickens, and I am going to\r\nshow you to-night that I can speak almost as good as you.\" When the moment\r\narrived Thackeray said never a word. Returning in the cab, both silent,\r\nThackeray suddenly broke forth. \"Lamar,\" he exclaimed, \"don't you think you\r\nhave heard the greatest speech to-night that was never delivered?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nHolding office, especially going to Congress, had never entered any wish\r\nor scheme of mine. Office seemed to me ever a badge of bondage. I knew too\r\nmuch of the national capital to be allured by its evanescent and lightsome\r\nhonors. When the opportunity sought me out none of its illusions appealed\r\nto me. But after a long uphill fight for personal and political recognition\r\nin Kentucky an election put a kind of seal upon the victory I had won and\r\nenabled me in a way to triumph over my enemies. I knew that if I accepted\r\nthe nomination offered me I would get a big popular vote--as I did--and so,\r\none full term, and half a term, incident to the death of the sitting member\r\nfor the Louisville district being open to me, I took the short term,\r\nrefusing the long term.\r\n\r\nThough it was midsummer and Congress was about to adjourn I went to\r\nWashington and was sworn in. A friend of mine, Col. Wake Holman, had made\r\na bet with one of our pals I would be under arrest before I had been\r\ntwenty-four hours in town, and won it. It happened in this wise: The night\r\nof the day when I took my seat there was an all-night session. I knew too\r\nwell what that meant, and, just from a long tiresome journey, I went to bed\r\nand slept soundly till sunrise. Just as I was up and dressing for a stroll\r\nabout the old, familiar, dearly loved quarter of the town there came an\r\nimperative rap upon the door and a voice said: \"Get up, colonel, quick!\r\nThis is a sergeant at arms. There has been a call of the House and I am\r\nafter you. Everybody is drunk, more or less, and they are noisy to have\r\nsome fun with you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was even as he said. Everybody, more or less, was drunk--especially the\r\nprovisional speaker whom Mr. Randall had placed in the chair--and when we\r\narrived and I was led a prisoner down the center aisle pandemonium broke\r\nloose.\r\n\r\nThey had all sorts of fun with me, such as it was. It was moved that I\r\nbe fined the full amount of my mileage. Then a resolution was offered\r\nsuspending my membership and sending me under guard to the old Capitol\r\nprison. Finally two or three of my friends rescued me and business was\r\nallowed to proceed. It was the last day of a very long session and those\r\nwho were not drunk were worn out.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home there was a celebration in honor of the bet Wake\r\nHolman had won at my expense. Wake was the most attractive and lovable of\r\nmen, by nature a hero, by profession a \"filibuster\" and soldier of fortune.\r\nAt two and twenty he was a private in Col. Humphrey Marshall's Regiment\r\nof Kentucky Riflemen, which reached the scene of hostilities upon the Rio\r\nGrande in the midsummer of 1846. He had enlisted from Owen county--\"Sweet\r\nOwen,\" as it used to be called--and came of good stock, his father, Col.\r\nHarry Holman, in the days of aboriginal fighting and journalism, a frontier\r\ncelebrity. Wake's company, out on a scout, was picked off by the Mexicans,\r\nand the distinction between United States soldiers and Texan rebels not\r\nbeing yet clearly established, a drumhead court-martial ordered \"the\r\ndecimation.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a decree that one of every ten of the Yankee captives should be\r\nshot. There being a hundred of Marshall's men, one hundred beans--ninety\r\nwhite and ten black--were put in a hat. Then the company was mustered as on\r\ndress parade. Whoso drew a white bean was to be held prisoner of war; whoso\r\ndrew a black bean was to die.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the drawing Wake drew a white bean. Toward the close\r\nthe turn of a neighbor and comrade from Owen county who had left a wife and\r\nbaby at home was called. He and Wake were standing together, Holman brushed\r\nhim aside, walked out in his place and drew his bean. It turned out to be a\r\nwhite one. Twice within the half hour death had looked him in the eye and\r\nfound no blinking there.\r\n\r\nI have seen quite a deal of hardihood, endurance, suffering, in both women\r\nand men; splendid courage on the field of action; perfect self-possession\r\nin the face of danger; but I rather think that Wake Holman's exploit that\r\nday--next to actually dying for a friend, what can be nobler than being\r\nwilling to die for him?--is the bravest thing I know or have ever been told\r\nof mortal man.\r\n\r\nWake Holman went to Cuba in the Lopez Rebellion of 1851, and fought under\r\nPickett at the Battle of Cardenas. In 1855-56 he was in Nicaragua, with\r\nWalker. He commanded a Kentucky regiment of cavalry on the Union side in\r\nour War of Sections. After the war he lived the life of a hunter and fisher\r\nat his home in Kentucky; a cheery, unambitious, big-brained and big-hearted\r\ncherub, whom it would not do to \"projeck\" with, albeit with entire safety\r\nyou could pick his pocket; the soul of simplicity and amiability.\r\n\r\nTo have known him was an education in primal manhood. To sit at his\r\nhospitable board, with him at the head of the table, was an inspiration in\r\nthe genius of life and the art of living. One of his familiars started the\r\njoke that when Wake drew the second white bean \"he got a peep.\" He took\r\nit kindly; though in my intimacy with him, extending over thirty years, I\r\nnever heard him refer to any of his adventures as a soldier.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that such a man should provide for his old age. He had\r\nlittle forecast. He knew not the value of money. He had humor, affection\r\nand courage. I held him in real love and honor. When the Mexican War\r\nPension Act was passed by Congress I took his papers to General Black, the\r\nCommissioner of Pensions, and related this story.\r\n\r\n\"I have promised Gen. Cerro Gordo Williams,\" said General Black, referring\r\nto the then senior United States Senator from Kentucky, \"that his name\r\nshall go first on the roll of these Mexican pensioners. But\"--and the\r\nGeneral looked beamingly in my face, a bit tearful, and says he: \"Wake\r\nHolman's name shall come right after.\" And there it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI was very carefully and for those times not ignorantly taught in music.\r\nSchell, his name was, and they called him \"Professor.\" He lived over in\r\nGeorgetown, where he had organized a little group of Prussian refugees into\r\na German club, and from my tenth to my fifteenth year--at first regularly,\r\nand then in a desultory way as I came back to Washington City from my\r\nschool in Philadelphia, he hammered Bach and Handel and Mozart--nothing so\r\nmodern as Mendelssohn--into my not unwilling nor unreceptive mind, for my\r\nbent was in the beginning to compose dramas, and in the end operas.\r\n\r\nAdelina Patti was among my child companions. Once in the national capital,\r\nwhen I was 12 years old and Adelina 9, we played together at a charity\r\nconcert. She had sung \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" and I had played her\r\nbrother-in-law's variation upon \"Home, Sweet Home.\" The audience was\r\nenthusiastic. We were called out again and again. Then we came on the stage\r\ntogether, and the applause increasing I sat down at the keyboard and played\r\nan accompaniment with my own interpolations upon \"Old Folks At Home,\" which\r\nI had taught Adelina, and she sang the words. Then they fairly took the\r\nroof off.\r\n\r\nOnce during a sojourn in Paris I was thrown with Christine Nilsson. She was\r\nin the heyday of her success at the Theater Lyrique under the patronage of\r\nMadame Miolan-Carvalho. One day I said to her: \"The time may come when you\r\nwill be giving concerts.\" She was indignant. \"Nevertheless,\" I continued,\r\n\"let me teach you a sure encore.\" I played her Stephen Foster's immortal\r\nditty. She was delighted. The sequel was that it served her even a better\r\nturn than it had served Adelina Patti.\r\n\r\nI played and transposed for the piano most of the melodies of Foster as\r\nthey were published, they being first produced in public by Christy's\r\nMinstrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Foster was the ne'er-do-well of a good Pennsylvania family. A\r\nsister of his had married a brother of James Buchanan. There were two\r\ndaughters of this marriage, nieces of the President, and when they were\r\nvisiting the White House we had--shall I dare write it?--high jinks with\r\nour nigger-minstrel concerts on the sly.\r\n\r\nWill S. Hays, the rival of Foster as a song writer and one of my reporters\r\non the Courier-Journal, told me this story: \"Foster,\" said he, \"was a good\r\ndeal of what you might call a barroom loafer. He possessed a sweet tenor\r\nvoice before it was spoiled by drink, and was fond of music, though\r\ntechnically he knew nothing about it. He had a German friend who when\r\nhe died left him a musical scrapbook, of all sorts of odds and ends of\r\noriginal text. There is where Foster got his melodies. When the scrapbook\r\ngave out he gave out.\"\r\n\r\nI took it as merely the spleen of a rival composer. But many years after\r\nin Vienna I heard a concert given over exclusively to the performance of\r\ncertain posthumous manuscripts of Schubert. Among the rest were selections\r\nfrom an unfinished opera--\"Rosemonde,\" I think it was called--in which the\r\nwhole rhythm and movements and parts of the score of Old Folks at Home were\r\nthe feature.\r\n\r\nIt was something to have grown up contemporary, as it were, with these\r\nsongs. Many of them were written in the old Rowan homestead, just outside\r\nof Bardstown, Ky., where Louis Philippe lived and taught, and for a season\r\nTalleyrand made his abode. The Rowans were notable people. John Rowan,\r\nthe elder, head of the house, was a famous lawyer, who divided oratorical\r\nhonors with Henry Clay, and like Clay, was a Senator in Congress; his son,\r\n\"young John,\" as he was called, Stephen Foster's pal, went as minister to\r\nNaples, and fought duels, and was as Bob Acres wanted to be, \"a devil of a\r\nfellow.\" He once told me he had been intimate with Thackeray when they were\r\nwild young men in Paris, and that they had both of them known the woman\r\nwhom Thackeray had taken for the original of Becky Sharp.\r\n\r\nThe Foster songs quite captivated my boyhood. I could sing a little, as\r\nwell as play, and learned each of them--especially Old Folks at Home and\r\nMy Old Kentucky Home--as they appeared. Their contemporary vogue was\r\ntremendous. Nothing has since rivalled the popular impression they made,\r\nexcept perhaps the Arthur Sullivan melodies.\r\n\r\nAmong my ambitions to be a great historian, dramatist, soldier and writer\r\nof romance I desired also to be a great musician, especially a great\r\npianist. The bone-felon did the business for this later. But all my life I\r\nhave been able to thumb the keyboard at least for the children to dance,\r\nand it has been a recourse and solace sometimes during intervals of\r\nembittered journalism and unprosperous statesmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore Thomas and I used to play duos together. He was a master of the\r\nviolin before he took to orchestration. We remained the best of friends to\r\nthe end of his days.\r\n\r\nOn the slightest provocation, or none, we passed entire nights together.\r\nOnce after a concert he suddenly exclaimed: \"Don't you think Wagner was a\r\n---- fraud?\"\r\n\r\nA little surprised even by one of his outbreaks, I said: \"Wagner may have\r\nwritten some trick music but I hardly think that he was a fraud.\"\r\n\r\nHe reflected a moment. \"Well,\" he continued, \"it may not lie in my mouth to\r\nsay it--and perhaps I ought not to say it--I know I am most responsible for\r\nthe Wagner craze--but I consider him a ---- fraud.\"\r\n\r\nHe had just come from a long \"classic entertainment,\" was worn out with\r\ntravel and worry, and meant nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nAfter a very tiresome concert when he was railing at the hard lines of a\r\nperipatetic musician I said: \"Come with me and I will give you a soothing\r\nquail and as dry a glass of champagne as you ever had in your life.\"\r\n\r\nThe wine was poured out and he took a sip.\r\n\r\n\"I don't call that dry wine,\" he crossly said, and took another sip. \"My\r\nGod,\" without a pause he continued, \"isn't that great?\"\r\n\r\nOf course he was impulsive, even impetuous. Beneath his seeming cold\r\nexterior and admirable self-control--the discipline of the master\r\nartist--lay the moods and tenses of the musical temperament. He knew little\r\nor nothing outside of music and did not care to learn. I tried to interest\r\nhim in politics. It was of no use. First he laughed my suggestions to scorn\r\nand then swore like a trooper. German he was, through and through. It\r\nwas well that he passed away before the world war. Pat Gilmore--\"Patrick\r\nSarsfield,\" we always called him--was a born politician, and if he had not\r\nbeen a musician he would have been a statesman. I kept the peace between\r\nhim and Theodore Thomas by an ingenious system of telling all kinds of kind\r\nthings each had said of the other, my \"repetitions\" being pure inventions\r\nof my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Fourteenth\r\n\r\n    Henry Adams and the Adams Family--John Hay and Frank Mason--The Three\r\n    _Mousquetaires_ of Culture--Paris--\"The Frenchman\"--The South of\r\n    France\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been of late reading The Education of Henry Adams, and it recalls\r\nmany persons and incidents belonging to the period about which I am now\r\nwriting. I knew Henry Adams well; first in London, then in Boston and\r\nfinally throughout his prolonged residence in Washington City. He was an\r\nAdams; very definitely an Adams, but, though his ghost may revisit the\r\nglimpses of the moon and chide me for saying so, with an English \"cut to\r\nhis jib.\"\r\n\r\nNo three brothers could be more unlike than Charles Francis, John Quincy\r\nand Henry Adams. Brooks Adams I did not know. They represented the fourth\r\ngeneration of the brainiest pedigree--that is in continuous line--known to\r\nour family history. Henry thought he was a philosopher and tried to be one.\r\nHe thought he was a man of the world and wanted to be one. He was, in spite\r\nof himself, a provincial.\r\n\r\nProvincialism is not necessarily rustic, even suburban. There is no\r\nprovincial quite so provincial as he who has passed his life in great\r\ncities. The Parisian boulevardier taken away from the asphalt, the cockney\r\na little off Clapham Common and the Strand, is lost. Henry Adams knew\r\nhis London and his Paris, his Boston and his Quincy--we must not forget\r\nQuincy--well. But he had been born, and had grown up, between the lids of\r\nhistory, and for all his learning and travel he never got very far outside\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn manner and manners, tone and cast of thought he was\r\nEnglish--delightfully English--though he cultivated the cosmopolite.\r\nHis house in the national capital, facing the Executive Mansion across\r\nLafayette Square--especially during the life of his wife, an adorable\r\nwoman, who made up in sweetness and tact for some of the qualities lacking\r\nin her husband--was an intellectual and high-bred center, a rendezvous for\r\nthe best ton and the most accepted people. The Adamses may be said to\r\nhave succeeded the Eameses as leaders in semi-social, semi-literary and\r\nsemi-political society.\r\n\r\nThere was a trio--I used to call them the Three Musketeers of Culture--John\r\nHay, Henry Cabot Lodge and Henry Adams. They made an interesting and\r\ninseparable trinity--Caleb Cushing, Robert J. Walker and Charles Sumner not\r\nmore so--and it was worth while to let them have the floor and to hear them\r\ntalk; Lodge, cool and wary as a politician should be; Hay, helterskelter,\r\nthe real man of the world crossed on a Western stock; and Adams, something\r\nof a litératteur, a statesman and a cynic.\r\n\r\nJohn Randolph Tucker, who when he was in Congress often met Henry at\r\ndinners and the like, said to him on the appearance of the early volumes of\r\nhis History of the United States: \"I am not disappointed, for how could an\r\nAdams be expected to do justice to a Randolph?\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was writing this history Adams said to me: \"There is an old\r\nvillain--next to Andrew Jackson the greatest villain of his time--a\r\nKentuckian--don't say he was a kinsman of yours!--whose papers, if he\r\nleft any, I want to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom are you referring?\" I asked with mock dignity.\r\n\r\n\"To John Adair,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"John Adair married my grandmother's sister and I can put\r\nyou in the way of getting whatever you require.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken of John Hay as Master of the Revels in the old\r\nSutherland-Delmonico days. Even earlier than that--in London and Paris--an\r\nintimacy had been established between us. He married in Cleveland, Ohio,\r\nand many years passed before I came up with him again. One day in Whitelaw\r\nReid's den in the Tribune Building he reappeared, strangely changed--no\r\nlonger the rosy-cheeked, buoyant boy--an overserious, prematurely old man.\r\nI was shocked, and when he had gone Reid, observing this, said: \"Oh, Hay\r\nwill come round all right. He is just now in one of his moods. I picked him\r\nup in Piccadilly the other day and by sheer force brought him over.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the story of Hay's life--one weird tragedy after another,\r\nfrom the murder of Lincoln to the murder of McKinley, including the tragic\r\nend of two members of his immediate family--there rises in spite of the\r\ngrandeur that pursued him a single exclamation: \"The pity of it!\"\r\n\r\nThis is accentuated by Henry Adams' Education. Yet the silent courage with\r\nwhich Hay met disaster after disaster must increase both the sympathy\r\nand the respect of those who peruse the melancholy pages of that vivid\r\nnarrative. Toward the end, meeting him on a public occasion, I said: \"You\r\nwork too hard--you are not looking well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am dying,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied in the way of banter, \"you are dying of fame and fortune.\"\r\n\r\nBut I went no further. He was in no mood for the old verbal horseplay.\r\n\r\nHe looked wan and wizened. Yet there were still several years before him.\r\nWhen he came from Mannheim to Paris it was clear that the end was nigh. I\r\ndid not see him--he was too ill to see any one--but Frank Mason kept me\r\nadvised from day to day, and when, a month or two later, having reached\r\nhome, the news came to us that he was dead we were nowise surprised, and\r\nalmost consoled by the thought that rest had come at last.\r\n\r\nFrank Mason and his wife--\"the Masons,\" they were commonly called, for Mrs.\r\nMason made a wondrous second to her husband--were from Cleveland, Ohio, she\r\na daughter of Judge Birchard--Jennie Birchard--he a rising young journalist\r\ncaught in the late seventies by the glitter of a foreign appointment. They\r\nran the gamut of the consular service, beginning with Basel and Marseilles\r\nand ending with Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris. Wherever they were their\r\nhouse was a very home--a kind of Yankee shrine--of visiting Americans and\r\nmilitant Americanism.\r\n\r\nYears before he was made consul general--in point of fact when he was plain\r\nconsul at Marseilles--he ran over to Paris for a lark. One day he said to\r\nme, \"A rich old hayseed uncle of mine has come to town. He has money to\r\nburn and he wants to meet you. I have arranged for us to dine with him at\r\nthe Anglaise to-night and we are to order the dinner--carte blanche.\" The\r\nrich old uncle to whom I was presented did not have the appearance of a\r\nhayseed. On the contrary he was a most distinguished-looking old gentleman.\r\nThe dinner we ordered was \"stunning\"--especially the wines. When the bill\r\nwas presented our host scanned it carefully, scrutinizing each item and\r\nmaking his own addition, altogether \"like a thoroughbred.\" Frank and I\r\nwatched him not without a bit of anxiety mixed with contrition. When he had\r\npaid the score he said with a smile: \"That was rather a steep bill, but we\r\nhave had rather a good dinner, and now, if you boys know of as good a dance\r\nhall we'll go there and I'll buy the outfit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst and last I have lived much in the erstwhile gay capital of France. It\r\nwas gayest when the Duke de Morny flourished as King of the Bourse. He was\r\nreputed the Emperor's natural half-brother. The breakdown of the Mexican\r\nadventure, which was mostly his, contributed not a little to the final\r\nNapoleonic fall. He died of dissipation and disappointment, and under the\r\npseudonym of the Duke de Morra, Daudet celebrated him in \"The Nabob.\"\r\n\r\nDe Morny did not live to see the tumble of the house of cards he had built.\r\nNext after I saw Paris it was a pitiful wreck indeed; the Hotel de Ville\r\nand the Tuileries in flames; the Column gone from the Place Vendôme; but\r\nlater the rise of the Third Republic saw the revival of the unquenchable\r\nspirit of the irrepressible French.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I should scarcely be taken for a Parisian. Once, when\r\nwandering aimlessly, as one so often does through the Paris streets, one of\r\nthe touts hanging round the Cafe de la Paix to catch the unwary stranger\r\nbeing a little more importunate than usual, I ordered him to go about his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"This is my business,\" he impudently answered.\r\n\r\n\"Get away, I tell you!\" I thundered, \"I am a Parisian myself!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a little out of reach of the umbrella I held in my hand, and with\r\na drawl of supreme and very American contempt, exclaimed, \"Well, you don't\r\nlook it,\" and scampered off.\r\n\r\nParis, however, is not all of France. Sometimes I have thought not the\r\nbest part of it. There is the south of France, with Avignon, the heart of\r\nProvence, seat of the French papacy six hundred years ago, the metropolis\r\nof Christendom before the Midi was a region--Paris yet a village, and Rome\r\nstruggling out of the debris of the ages--with Arles and Nîmes, and, above\r\nall, Tarascon, the home of the immortal Tartarin, for next-door neighbors.\r\nThey are all hard by Marseilles. But Avignon ever most caught my fancy, for\r\nthere the nights seem peopled with the ghosts of warriors and cardinals,\r\nand there on festal mornings the spirits of Petrarch and his Laura walk\r\nabroad, the ramparts, which bade defiance to Goth and Vandal and Saracen\r\nhordes, now giving shelter to bats and owls, but the atmosphere laden with\r\nlegend\r\n\r\n  _\"...tasting of Flora and the country green,\r\n  Dance and Provençal song and sun-burnt mirth.\"_\r\n\r\nSomething too much of this! Let me not yield to the spell of the\r\npicturesque. To recur to matters of fact and get down to prose and the\r\ntimes we live in let us halt a moment on this southerly journey and have a\r\nlook in upon Lyons, the industrial capital of France, which is directly on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nThe idiosyncrasy of Lyons is silk. There are two schools of introduction in\r\nthe art of silk weaving, one of them free to any lad in the city, the other\r\nrequiring a trifle of matriculation. The first of these witnesses the whole\r\nprocess of fabrication from the reeling of threads to the finishing of\r\ndress goods, and the loom painting of pictures. It is most interesting of\r\ncourse, the painstaking its most obvious feature, the individual weaver\r\nliving with his family upon a wage representing the cost of the barest\r\nnecessities of life. Again, and ever and ever again, the inequalities of\r\nfortune! Where will it end?\r\n\r\nThe world has tried revolution and it has tried anarchy. Always the\r\nsurvival of the strong, nicknamed by Spencer and his ilk the \"fittest.\" Ten\r\nthousand heads were chopped off during the Terror in France to make room\r\nfor whom? Not for the many, but the few; though it must be allowed that in\r\nsome ways the conditions were improved.\r\n\r\nYet here after a hundred years, here in Lyons, faithful, intelligent men\r\nstruggle for sixty, for forty cents a day, with never a hope beyond! What\r\nis to be done about it? Suppose the wealth of the universe were divided per\r\ncapita, how long would it remain out of the clutches of the Napoleons of\r\nfinance, only a percentage of whom find ultimately their Waterloo, little\r\nto the profit of the poor who spin and delve, who fight and die, in the\r\nGrand Army of the Wretched!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe read a deal that is amusing about the southerly Frenchman. He is indeed\r\n_sui generis_. Some five and twenty years ago there appeared in\r\nLouisville a dapper gentleman, who declared himself a Marseillais, and who\r\nsubsequently came to be known variously as The Major and The Frenchman. I\r\nshall not mention him otherwise in this veracious chronicle, but, looking\r\nthrough the city directory of Marseilles I found an entire page devoted to\r\nhis name, though all the entries may not have been members of his family.\r\nThere is no doubt that he was a Marseillais.\r\n\r\nWandering through the streets of the old city, now in a café of La\r\nCannebière and now along a quay of the Old Port, his ghost has often\r\ncrossed my path and dogged my footsteps, though he has lain in his grave\r\nthis many a day. I grew to know him very well, to be first amused by him,\r\nthen to be interested, and in the end to entertain an affection for him.\r\n\r\nThe Major was a delightful composite of Tartarin of Tarascon and the\r\nBrigadier Gerard, with a dash of the Count of Monte Cristo; for when he was\r\nflush--which by some odd coincidence happened exactly four times a year--he\r\nwas as liberal a spendthrift as one could wish to meet anywhere between the\r\nlittle principality of Monaco and the headwaters of the Nile; transparent\r\nas a child; idiosyncratic to a degree.\r\n\r\nI understand Marseilles better and it has always seemed nearer to me since\r\nhe was born there and lived there when a boy, and, I much fear me, was\r\ndriven away, the scapegrace of excellent and wealthy people; not, I feel\r\nsure, for any offense that touched the essential parts of his manhood. A\r\ngentler, a more upright and harmless creature I never knew in all my life.\r\n\r\nI very well recall when he first arrived in the Kentucky metropolis. His\r\nattire and raiment were faultless. He wore a rose in his coat, he carried\r\na delicate cane, and a most beautiful woman hung upon his arm. She was his\r\nwife. It was a circumstance connected with this lady which led to the after\r\nintimacy between him and me. She fell dangerously ill. I had casually met\r\nher husband as an all-round man-about-town, and by this token, seeking\r\nsympathy on lines of least resistance, he came to me with his sorrow.\r\n\r\nI have never seen grief more real and fervid. He swore, on his knees and\r\nwith tears in his eyes, that if she recovered, if God would give her back\r\nto him, he would never again touch a card; for gambling was his passion,\r\nand even among amateurs he would have been accounted the softest of soft\r\nthings. His prayer was answered, she did recover, and he proceeded to\r\nfulfill his vow.\r\n\r\nBut what was he to do? He had been taught, or at least he had learned,\r\nto do nothing, not even to play poker! I suggested that as running a\r\nrestaurant was a French prerogative and that as he knew less about cooking\r\nthan about anything else--we had had a contest or two over the mysteries of\r\na pair of chafing dishes--and as there was not a really good eating place\r\nin Louisville, he should set up a restaurant. It was said rather in jest\r\nthan in earnest; but I was prepared to lend him the money. The next thing I\r\nknew, and without asking for a dollar, he had opened The Brunswick.\r\n\r\nIn those days I saw the Courier-Journal to press, turning night into day,\r\nand during a dozen years I took my twelve o'clock supper there. It was thus\r\nand from these beginnings that the casual acquaintance between us ripened\r\ninto intimacy, and that I gradually came into a knowledge of the reserves\r\nbehind The Major's buoyant optimism and occasional gasconnade.\r\n\r\nHe ate and drank sparingly; but he was not proof against the seduction\r\nof good company, and he had plenty of it, from William Preston to Joseph\r\nJefferson, with such side lights as Stoddard Johnston, Boyd Winchester,\r\nIsaac Caldwell and Proctor Knott, of the Home Guard--very nearly all the\r\ncelebrities of the day among the outsiders--myself the humble witness\r\nand chronicler. He secured an excellent chef, and of course we lived\r\nexceedingly well.\r\n\r\nThe Major's most obvious peculiarity was that he knew everything and had\r\nbeen everywhere. If pirates were mentioned he flowered out at once into an\r\nadventure upon the sea; if bandits, on the land. If it was Wall Street\r\nhe had a reminiscence and a scheme; if gambling, a hard-luck story and\r\na system. There was no quarter of the globe of which he had not been an\r\ninhabitant.\r\n\r\nOnce the timbered riches of Africa being mentioned, at once the Major gave\r\nus a most graphic account of how \"the old house\"--for thus he designated\r\nsome commercial establishment, which either had no existence or which he\r\nhad some reason for not more particularly indicating--had sent him in\r\ncharge of a rosewood saw mill on the Ganges, and, after many ups and downs,\r\nof how the floods had come and swept the plant away; and Rudolph Fink, who\r\nwas of the party, immediately said, \"I can attest the truth of The Major's\r\nstory, because my brother Albert and I were in charge of some fishing camps\r\nat the mouth of the Ganges at the exact date of the floods, and we caught\r\nmany of those rosewood logs in our nets as they floated out to sea.\"\r\n\r\nAugustine's Terrapin came to be for a while the rage in Philadelphia, and\r\neven got as far as New York and Washington, and straightway, The Major\r\ndeclared he could and would make Augustine and his terrapin look \"like a\r\nmonkey.\" He proposed to give a dinner.\r\n\r\nThere were great preparations and expectancy. None of us ate much at\r\nluncheon that day. At the appointed hour, we assembled at The Brunswick. I\r\nwill dismiss the decorations and the preludes except to say that they were\r\nParisian. After a while in full regalia The Major appeared, a train of\r\nservants following with a silver tureen. The lid was lifted.\r\n\r\n\"_Voilà!_\" says he.\r\n\r\nThe vision disclosed to our startled eyes was an ocean that looked like\r\nbean soup flecked by a few strands of black crape!\r\n\r\nThe explosion duly arrived from the assembled gourmets, I, myself, I am\r\nsorry to say, leading the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"I put seeks terrapin in zat soup!\" exclaimed The Frenchman, quite losing\r\nhis usual good English in his excitement.\r\n\r\nWe reproached him. We denounced him. He was driven from the field. But he\r\nbore us no malice. Ten days later he invited us again, and this time Sam\r\nWard himself could have found no fault with the terrapin.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, when I knew The Major was asleep, I slipped back into the\r\nkitchen and said to Louis Garnier, the chef: \"Is there any of that terrapin\r\nleft over from last night?\"\r\n\r\nAll unconscious of his treason Louis took me into the pantry and\r\ntriumphantly showed me three jars bearing the Augustine label and the\r\nPhiladelphia express tags!\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a friend of The Major's, passing The Brunswick and\r\nobserving some diamond-back shells in the window said, \"Major, have you any\r\nreal live terrapins?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry Woodfin Grady One of Mr. Watterson's \"Boys\".]\r\n\r\n\"Live!\" cried The Frenchman. \"Only this morning I open the ice box and they\r\nwere all dancing the cancan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Major,\" persisted the friend, \"I'll go you a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, you\r\ncannot show me an actual living terrapin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you take me for--confidence man?\" The Major retorted. \"How you\r\nexpect an old sport like me to bet upon a certainty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind your ethics. The wager is drink, not money. In any event we\r\nshall have the wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" says The Frenchman, with a shrug and a droll grimace, \"if you\r\ninsist on paying for a bottle of wine come with me.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a lighted candle, and together they went back to the ice box. It\r\nwas literally filled with diamond backs, and my friend thought he was gone\r\nfor sure.\r\n\r\n\"Là!\" says The Major with triumph, rummaging among the mass of shells with\r\nhis cane as he held the candle aloft.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says my friend, ready to surrender, yet taking a last chance, \"you\r\ntold me they were dancing the cancan!\"\r\n\r\nThe Major picked up a terrapin and turned it over in his hand. Quite numb\r\nand frozen, the animal within made no sign. Then he stirred the shells\r\nabout in the box with his cane. Still not a show of life. Of a sudden he\r\nstopped, reflected a moment, then looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he murmured. \"I quite forget. The terrapin, they are asleep. It is\r\nten-thirty, and the terrapin he regularly go to sleep at ten o'clock by\r\nthe watch every night.\" And without another word he reached for the Veuve\r\nCliquot!\r\n\r\nFor all his volubility in matters of romance and sentiment The Major was\r\nexceeding reticent about his immediate self and his own affairs. His\r\nlegends referred to the distant of time and place. A certain dignity could\r\nnot be denied him, and, on occasion, a proper reserve; he rarely mentioned\r\nhis business--though he worked like a slave, and could not have been making\r\nmuch or any profit--so that there rose the query how he contrived to make\r\nboth ends meet. Little by little I came into the knowledge that there was\r\na money supply from somewhere; finally, it matters not how, that he had an\r\nannuity of forty thousand francs, paid in quarterly installments of ten\r\nthousand francs each.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he mentioned \"the Old House,\" and in relating the famous\r\nSophonisba episode late at night, and only in the very fastnesses of\r\nthe wine cellar, as it were, at the most lachrymose passage he spoke of\r\n\"l'Oncle Célestin,\" with the deepest feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear The Frenchman tell that story about Sophonisba?\" Doctor\r\nStoic, whom on account of his affectation of insensibility we were wont to\r\ncall Old Adamant, once asked me. \"Well, sir, the other night he told it to\r\nme, and he was drunk, and he cried, sir; and I was drunk, and I cried too!\"\r\n\r\nI had known The Frenchman now ten or a dozen years. That he came\r\nfrom Marseilles, that he had served on the Confederate side in the\r\nTrans-Mississippi, that he possessed an annuity, that he must have been\r\nwell-born and reared, that he was simple, yet canny, and in his money\r\ndealings scrupulously honest--was all I could be sure of. What had he done\r\nto be ashamed about or wish to conceal? In what was he a black sheep, for\r\nthat he had been one seemed certain? Had the beautiful woman, his wife--a\r\ntireless church and charity worker, who lived the life of a recluse and a\r\nsaint--had she reclaimed him from his former self? I knew that she had\r\nbeen the immediate occasion of his turning over a new leaf. But before her\r\ntime what had he been, what had he done?\r\n\r\nLate one night, when the rain was falling and the streets were empty, I\r\nentered The Brunswick. It was empty too. In the farthest corner of the\r\nlittle dining room The Major, his face buried in his hands, laid upon the\r\ntable in front of him, sat silently weeping. He did not observe my entrance\r\nand I seated myself on the opposite side of the table. Presently he looked\r\nup, and seeing me, without a word passed me a letter which, all blistered\r\nwith tears, had brought him to this distressful state. It was a formal\r\nFrench burial summons, with its long list of family names--his among the\r\nrest--the envelope, addressed in a lady's hand--his sister's, the wife of\r\na nobleman in high military command--the postmark \"Lyon.\" Uncle Celestin\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nThereafter The Frenchman told me much which I may not recall and must not\r\nrepeat; for, included in that funeral list were some of the best names in\r\nFrance, Uncle Célestin himself not the least of them.\r\n\r\nAt last he died, and as mysteriously as he had come his body was taken\r\naway, nobody knew when, nobody where, and with it went the beautiful woman,\r\nhis wife, of whom from that day to this I have never heard a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Fifteenth\r\n\r\n    Still the Gay Capital of France--Its Environs--Walewska and De\r\n    Morny--Thackeray in Paris--A _Pension_ Adventure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the generations thinks itself commonplace. Familiarity breeds\r\nequally indifference and contempt. Yet no age of the world has witnessed so\r\nmuch of the drama of life--of the romantic and picturesque--as the age\r\nwe live in. The years betwixt Agincourt and Waterloo were not more\r\ndelightfully tragic than the years between Serajevo and Senlis.\r\n\r\nThe gay capital of France remains the center of the stage and retains the\r\ninterest of the onlooking universe. All roads lead to Paris as all roads\r\nled to Rome. In Dickens' day \"a tale of two cities\" could only mean London\r\nand Paris then, and ever so unalike. To be brought to date the title would\r\nhave now to read \"three,\" or even \"four,\" cities, New York and Chicago\r\nputting in their claims for mundane recognition.\r\n\r\nI have been not only something of a traveller, but a diligent student\r\nof history and a voracious novel reader, and, once-in-a-while, I get my\r\nhistory and my fiction mixed. This has been especially the case when the\r\nhum-drum of the Boulevards has driven me from the fascinations of the Beau\r\nQuartier into the by-ways of the Marais and the fastnesses of what was once\r\nthe Latin Quarter. More than fifty years of intimacy have enabled me to\r\nlearn many things not commonly known, among them that Paris is the most\r\norderly and moral city in the world, except when, on rare and brief\r\noccasions, it has been stirred to its depths.\r\n\r\nI have crossed the ocean many times--have lived, not sojourned, on the\r\nbanks of the Seine, and, as I shall never see the other side again--do\r\nnot want to see it in its time of sorrow and garb of mourning--I may be\r\nforgiven a retrospective pause in this egotistic chronicle. Or, shall I not\r\nsay, a word or two of affectionate retrogression, though perchance it leads\r\nme after the manner of Silas Wegg to drop into poetry and take a turn with\r\na few ghosts into certain of their haunts, when you, dear sir, or madame,\r\nor miss, as the case may be, and I were living that \"other life,\" whereof\r\nwe remember so little that we cannot recall who we were, or what name we\r\nwent by, howbeit now-and-then we get a glimpse in dreams, or a \"hunch\" from\r\nthe world of spirits, or spirts-and-water, which makes us fancy we might\r\nhave been Julius Caesar, or Cleopatra--as maybe we were!--or at least Joan\r\nof Arc, or Jean Valjean!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me repeat that upon no spot of earth has the fable we call existence\r\nhad so rare a setting and rung up its curtain upon such a succession of\r\nperformances; has so concentrated human attention upon mundane affairs; has\r\ncalled such a muster roll of stage favorites; has contributed to romance so\r\nmany heroes and heroines, to history so many signal episodes and personal\r\nexploits, to philosophy so much to kindle the craving for vital knowledge,\r\nto stir sympathy and to awaken reflection.\r\n\r\nGreece and Rome seem but myths of an Age of Fable. They live for us as\r\npictures live, as statues live. What was it I was saying about statues--that\r\nthey all look alike to me? There are too many of them. They bring the\r\nancients down to us in marble and bronze, not in flesh and blood. We do not\r\nreally laugh with Terence and Horace, nor weep with Æschylus and Homer. The\r\nvery nomenclature has a ticket air like tags on a collection of curios in\r\nan auction room, droning the dull iteration of a catalogue. There is as\r\nlittle to awaken and inspire in the system of religion and ethics of the\r\npagan world they lived in as in the eyes of the stone effigies that stare\r\nblankly upon us in the British Museum, the Uffizi and the Louvre.\r\n\r\nWe walk the streets of the Eternal City with wonderment, not with pity, the\r\nhuman side quite lost in the archaic. What is Cæsar to us, or we to Cæsar?\r\nJove's thunder no longer terrifies, and we look elsewhere than the Medici\r\nVenus for the lights o' love.\r\n\r\nNot so with Paris. There the unbroken line of five hundred\r\nyears--semi-modern years, marking a longer period than we commonly ascribe\r\nto Athens or Rome--beginning with the exit of this our own world from the\r\ndark ages into the partial light of the middle ages, and continuing thence\r\nthrough the struggle of man toward achievement--tells us a tale more\r\nconsecutive and thrilling, more varied and instructive, than may be found\r\nin all the pages of all the chroniclers and poets of the civilizations\r\nwhich vibrated between the Bosphorus and the Tiber, to yield at last to\r\ntriumphant Barbarism swooping down from Tyrol crag and Alpine height, from\r\nthe fastnesses of the Rhine and the Rhone, to swallow luxury and culture.\r\nRefinement had done its perfect work. It had emasculated man and unsexed\r\nwoman and brought her to the front as a political force, even as it is\r\ntrying to do now.\r\n\r\nThe Paris of Balzac and Dumas, of De Musset and Hugo--even of\r\nThackeray--could still be seen when I first went there. Though our age is\r\nas full of all that makes for the future of poetry and romance, it does not\r\ncontemporaneously lend itself to sentimental abstraction. Yet it is hard to\r\nseparate fact and fiction here; to decide between the true and the\r\nfalse; to pluck from the haze with which time has enveloped them, and to\r\ndistinguish the puppets of actual flesh and blood who lived and moved and\r\nhad their being, and the phantoms of imagination called into life and\r\ngiven each its local habitation and its name by the poet's pen working its\r\nimmemorial spell upon the reader's credulity.\r\n\r\nTo me D'Artagnan is rather more vital than Richelieu. Hugo's imps\r\nand Balzac's bullies dance down the stage and shut from the view the\r\ntax-collectors and the court favorites. The mousquetaires crowd the field\r\nmarshals off the scene. There is something real in Quasimodo, in Cæsar de\r\nBirotteau, in Robert Macaire, something mythical in Mazarin, in the Regent\r\nand in Jean Lass. Even here, in faraway Kentucky, I can shut my eyes and\r\nsee the Lady of Dreams as plainly as if she were coming out of the Bristol\r\nor the Ritz to step into her automobile, while the Grande Mademoiselle is\r\nmerely a cloud of clothes and words that for me mean nothing at all.\r\n\r\nI once passed a week, day by day, roaming through the Musee Carnavalet.\r\nMadame de Sevigne had an apartment and held her salon there for nearly\r\ntwenty years. Hard by is the house where the Marquise de Brinvilliers--a\r\ngentle, blue-eyed thing they tell us--a poor, insane creature she must have\r\nbeen--disseminated poison and death, and, just across and beyond the Place\r\ndes Vosges, the Hotel de Sens, whither Queen Margot took her doll-rags and\r\ndid her spriting after she and Henri Quatre had agreed no longer to slide\r\ndown the same cellar door. There is in the Museum a death-mask, colored and\r\nexceeding life-like, taken the day after Ravaillac delivered the finishing\r\nknife-thrust in the Rue de Ferronnerie, which represents the Bèarnais as\r\nanything but a tamer of hearts. He was a fighter, however, from Wayback,\r\nand I dare say Dumas' narrative is quite as authentic as any.\r\n\r\nOne can scarce wonder that men like Hugo and Balzac chose this quarter\r\nof the town to live in--and Rachael, too!--it having given such frequent\r\nshelter to so many of their fantastic creations, having been the real abode\r\nof a train of gallants and bravos, of saints and harlots from the days of\r\nDiane de Poitiers to the days of Pompadour and du Barry, and of statesmen\r\nand prelates likewise from Sully to Necker, from Colbert to Turgot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI speak of the Marais as I might speak of Madison Square, or Hyde Park--as\r\na well-known local section--yet how few Americans who have gone to Paris\r\nhave ever heard of it. It is in the eastern division of the town. One finds\r\nit a curious circumstance that so many if not most of the great cities\r\nsomehow started with the rising, gradually to migrate toward the setting\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wandered about Paris there was little west of the Arch of\r\nStars except groves and meadows. Neuilly and Passy were distant villages.\r\nAuteuil was a safe retreat for lovers and debtors, with comic opera villas\r\nnestled in high-walled gardens. To Auteuil Armand Duval and his Camille\r\nhied away for their short-lived idyl. In those days there was a lovely lane\r\ncalled Marguerite Gautier, with a dovecote pointed out as the very \"rustic\r\ndwelling\" so pathetically sung in Verdi's tuneful score and tenderly\r\ndescribed in the original Dumas text. The Boulevard Montmorenci long ago\r\nplowed the shrines of romance out of the knowledge of the living, and a\r\npart of the Longchamps racecourse occupies the spot whither impecunious\r\npoets and adventure-seeking wives repaired to escape the insistence of\r\ncruel bailiffs and the spies of suspicious and monotonous husbands.\r\n\r\nTempus fugit! I used to read Thackeray's Paris Sketches with a kind of awe.\r\nThe Thirties and the Forties, reincarnated and inspired by his glowing\r\nspirit, seemed clad in translucent garments, like the figures in the\r\nNibelungenlied, weird, remote, glorified. I once lived in the street \"for\r\nwhich no rhyme our language yields,\" next door to a pastry shop\r\nthat claimed to have furnished the mise en scène for the \"Ballad of\r\nBouillabaisse,\" and I often followed the trail of Louis Dominic Cartouche\r\n\"down that lonely and crooked byway that, setting forth from a palace yard,\r\nled finally to the rear gate of a den of thieves.\" Ah, well-a-day! I have\r\nknown my Paris now twice as long as Thackeray knew his Paris, and my Paris\r\nhas been as interesting as his Paris, for it includes the Empire, the Siege\r\nand the Republic.\r\n\r\nI knew and sat for months at table with Comtesse Walewska, widow of the\r\nbastard son of Napoleon Bonaparte. The Duke de Morny was rather a person in\r\nhis way and Gambetta was no slouch, as Titmarsh would himself agree. I knew\r\nthem both. The Mexican scheme, which was going to make every Frenchman\r\nrich, was even more picturesque and tragical than the Mississippi bubble.\r\nThere were lively times round about the last of the Sixties and the early\r\nSeventies. The Terror lasted longer, but it was not much more lurid than\r\nthe Commune; the Hotel de Ville and the Tuileries in flames, the column\r\ngone from the Place Vendôme, when I got there just after the siege. The\r\nregions of the beautiful Opera House and of the venerable Notre Dame they\r\ntold me had been but yesterday running streams of blood. At the corner of\r\nthe Rue de la Paix and the Rue Dannou (they called it then the Rue St.\r\nAugustine) thirty men, women, and boys were one forenoon stood against\r\nthe wall and shot, volley upon volley, to death. In the Sacristy of the\r\nCathedral over against the Morgue and the Hotel Dieu, they exhibit the\r\ngore-stained vestments of three archbishops of Paris murdered within as\r\nmany decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThackeray came to Paris when a very young man. He was for painting\r\npictures, not for writing books, and he retained his artistic yearnings if\r\nnot ambitions long after he had become a great and famous man of letters.\r\nIt was in Paris that he married his wife, and in Paris that the melancholy\r\nfinale came to pass; one of the most heartbreaking chapters in literary\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHis little girls lived here with their grandparents. The elder of them\r\nrelates how she was once taken up some flights of stairs by the Countess X\r\nto the apartment of a frail young man to whom the Countess was carrying a\r\nbasket of fruit; and how the frail young man insisted, against the protest\r\nof the Countess, upon sitting at the piano and playing; and of how they\r\ncame out again, the eyes of the Countess streaming with tears, and of her\r\nsaying, as they drove away, \"Never, never forget, my child, as long as\r\nyou live, that you have heard Chopin play.\" It was in one of the lubberly\r\nhouses of the Place Vendôme that the poet of the keyboard died a few days\r\nlater. Just around the corner, in the Rue du Mont Thabor, died Alfred de\r\nMusset. A brass plate marks the house.\r\n\r\nMay I not here transcribe that verse of the famous \"Ballad of\r\nBouillabaisse,\" which I have never been able to recite, or read aloud, and\r\npart of which I may at length take to myself:\r\n\r\n  _\"Ah me, how quick the days are flitting!\r\n  I mind me of a time that's gone,\r\n  When here I'd sit, as now I'm sitting\r\n  In this same place--but not alone--\r\n  A fair young form was nestled near me,\r\n  A dear, dear face looked fondly up,\r\n  And sweetly spoke and smiled to hear me,\r\n  There's no one now to share my cup.\"_\r\n\r\nThe writer of these lines a cynic! Nonsense. When will the world learn to\r\ndiscriminate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak of Paris without giving a foremost place in the\r\nmemorial retrospect to the Bois de Boulogne, the Parisian's Coney Island.\r\nI recall that I passed the final Sunday of my last Parisian sojourn just\r\nbefore the outbreak of the World War with a beloved family party in the\r\njoyous old Common. There is none like it in the world, uniting the urban\r\nto the rural with such surpassing grace as perpetually to convey a double\r\nsensation of pleasure; primal in its simplicity, superb in its setting; in\r\nthe variety and brilliancy of the life which, upon sunny afternoons, takes\r\npossession of it and makes it a cross between a parade and a paradise.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when, rather far away for foot travel, the Bois might\r\nbe considered a driving park for the rich. It fairly blazed with the\r\nostentatious splendor of the Second Empire; the shoddy Duke with his shady\r\nretinue, in gilded coach-and-four; the world-famous courtesan, bedizened\r\nwith costly jewels and quite as well known as the Empress; the favorites\r\nof the Tuileries, the Comédie Française, the Opera, the Jardin Mabille,\r\nforming an unceasing and dazzling line of many-sided frivolity from the\r\nPort de Ville to the Port St. Cloud, circling round La Bagatelle and\r\nranging about the Cafe Cascade, a human tiara of diamonds, a moving bouquet\r\nof laces and rubies, of silks and satins and emeralds and sapphires. Those\r\nwere the days when the Due de Morny, half if not full brother of the\r\nEmperor, ruled as king of the Bourse, and Cora Pearl, a clever and not at\r\nall good-looking Irish girl gone wrong, reigned as Queen of the Demimonde.\r\n\r\nAll this went by the board years ago. Everywhere, more or less, electricity\r\nhas obliterated distinctions of rank and wealth. It has circumvented lovers\r\nand annihilated romance. The Republic ousted the bogus nobility. The\r\nsubways and the tram cars connect the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de\r\nVincennes so closely that the poorest may make himself at home in either or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe automobile, too, oddly enough, is proving a very leveller. The crowd\r\nrecognizes nobody amid the hurly-burly of coupes, pony-carts, and taxicabs,\r\neach trying to pass the other. The conglomeration of personalities effaces\r\nthe identity alike of the statesman and the artist, the savant and the\r\ncyprian. No six-inch rules hedge the shade of the trees and limit the glory\r\nof the grass. The _ouvrier_ can bring his brood and his basket and\r\nhave his picnic where he pleases. The pastry cook and his chére amie,\r\nthe coiffeur and his grisette can spoon by the lake-side as long as the\r\nmoonlight lasts, and longer if they list, with never a gendarme to say them\r\nnay, or a rude voice out of the depths hoarsely to declaim, \"allez!\" The\r\nBois de Boulogne is literally and absolutely a playground, the playground\r\nof the people, and this last Sunday of mine, not fewer than half a million\r\nof Parisians were making it their own.\r\n\r\nHalf of these encircled the Longchamps racecourse. The other half were\r\nshared by the boats upon the lagoons and the bosky dells under the summer\r\nsky and the cafés and the restaurants with which the Bois abounds. Our\r\nparty, having exhausted the humors of the drive, repaired to Pré Catalan.\r\nAside from the \"two old brides\" who are always in evidence on such\r\noccasions, there was a veritable \"young couple,\" exceedingly pretty to look\r\nat, and delightfully in love! That sort of thing is not so uncommon in\r\nParis as cynics affect to think.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as the witty Frenchman observes, that \"gambling is the\r\nrecreation of gentlemen and the passion of fools,\" it is equally true that\r\nlove is a game where every player wins if he sticks to it and is loyal to\r\nit. Just as credit is the foundation of business is love both the asset\r\nand the trade-mark of happiness. To see it is to believe it, and--though a\r\nlittle cash in hand is needful to both--where either is wanting, look out\r\nfor sheriffs and scandals.\r\n\r\nPré Catalan, once a pasture for cows with a pretty kiosk for the sale\r\nof milk, has latterly had a tea-room big enough to seat a thousand, not\r\ncounting the groves which I have seen grow up about it thickly dotted with\r\nbooths and tables, where some thousands more may regale themselves. That\r\nSunday it was never so glowing with animation and color. As it makes one\r\nhappy to see others happy it makes one adore his own land to witness that\r\nwhich makes other lands great.\r\n\r\nI have not loved Paris as a Parisian, but as an American; perhaps it is a\r\nstretch of words to say I love Paris at all. I used to love to go there and\r\nto behold the majesty of France. I have always liked to mark the startling\r\ncontrasts of light and shade. I have always known what all the world now\r\nknows, that beneath the gayety of the French there burns a patriotic\r\nand consuming fire, a high sense of public honor; a fine spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice along with the sometimes too aggressive spirit of freedom.\r\nIn 1873 I saw them two blocks long and three files deep upon the Rue St.\r\nHonore press up to the Bank of France, old women and old men with their\r\nlittle all tied in handkerchiefs and stockings to take up the tribute\r\nrequired by Bismarck to rid the soil of the detested German. They did it.\r\nAlone they did it--the French people--the hard-working, frugal, loyal\r\ncommonalty of France--without asking the loan of a sou from the world\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting of that last Sunday in the Bois de Boulogne, I find by recurring\r\nto the record that I said: \"There is a deal more of good than bad in every\r\nNation. I take off my hat to the French. But, I have had my fling and I am\r\nquite ready to go home. Even amid the gayety and the glare, the splendor of\r\ncolor and light, the Hungarian band wafting to the greenery and the stars\r\nthe strains of the delicious waltz, La Veuve Joyeuse her very self--yea,\r\nmany of her--tapping the time at many adjacent tables, the song that fills\r\nmy heart is 'Hame, Hame, Hame!--Hame to my ain countree.' Yet, to come\r\nagain, d'ye mind? I should be loath to say good-by forever to the Bois\r\nde Boulogne. I want to come back to Paris. I always want to come back to\r\nParis. One needs not to make an apology or give a reason.\r\n\r\n\"We turn rather sadly away from Pré Catalan and the Café Cascade. We\r\nglide adown the flower-bordered path and out from the clusters of Chinese\r\nlanterns, and leave the twinkling groves to their music and merry-making.\r\nYonder behind us, like a sentinel, rises Mont Valerien. Before us glimmer\r\nthe lamps of uncountable coaches, as our own, veering toward the city,\r\nthe moon just topping the tower of St. Jacques de la Boucherie and\r\nsilver-plating the bronze figures upon the Arch of Stars.\r\n\r\n\"We enter the Port Maillot. We turn into the Avenue du Bois. Presently we\r\nshall sweep with the rest through the Champs Èlysées and on to the ocean of\r\nthe infinite, the heart of the mystery we call Life, nowhere so condensed,\r\nso palpable, so appealing. Roll the screen away! The shades of Clovis and\r\nGenevieve may be seen hand-in-hand with the shades of Martel and Pepin,\r\ntaking the round of the ghost-walk between St. Denis and St. Germain, now\r\nle Balafré and again Navarre, now the assassins of the Ligue and now the\r\nassassins of the Terror, to keep them company. Nor yet quite all on murder\r\nbent, some on pleasure; the Knights and Ladies of the Cloth of Gold and the\r\nhosts of the Renaissance: Cyrano de Bergerac and François Villon leading\r\nthe ragamuffin procession; the jades of the Fronde, Longueville, Chevreuse\r\nand fair-haired Anne of Austria; and Ninon, too, and Manon; and the\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten Four, 'one for all and all for one;' Cagliostro and\r\nMonte Cristo; on the side, Rabelais taking notes and laughing under his\r\ncowl. Catherine de Medici and Robespierre slinking away, poor, guilty\r\nthings, into the pale twilight of the Dawn!\r\n\r\n\"Names! Names! Only names? I am not just so sure about that. In any event,\r\nwhat a roll call! We are such stuff as dreams are made of, and our little\r\nlife is rounded by a sleep; the selfsame sleep which these, our living dead\r\nmen and women in steel armor and gauzy muslins, in silken hose and sock and\r\nbuskin, epaulettes and top boots, brocades and buff facings, have endured\r\nso long and know so well!\r\n\r\n\"If I should die in Paris I should expect them--or some of them--to meet me\r\nat the barriers and to say, 'Behold, the wickedness that was done in the\r\nworld, the cruelty and the wrong, dwelt in the body, not in the soul of\r\nman, which freed from its foul incasement, purified and made eternal by the\r\nhand of death, shall see both the glory and the hand of God!'\"\r\n\r\nIt was not to be. I shall not die in Paris. I shall never come again.\r\nNeither shall I make apology for this long quotation by myself from myself,\r\nfor am I not inditing an autobiography, so called?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Sixteenth\r\n\r\n    Monte Carlo--The European Shrine of Sport and Fashion--Apocryphal\r\n    Gambling Stories--Leopold, King of the Belgians--An Able and\r\n    Picturesque Man of Business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving disported ourselves in and about Paris, next in order comes a\r\njourney to the South of France--that is to the Riviera--by geography the\r\nmain circle of the Mediterranean Sea, by proclamation Cannes, Nice, and\r\nMentone, by actual fact and count, Monte Carlo--even the swells adopting a\r\ncertain hypocrisy as due to virtue.\r\n\r\nWhilst Monte Carlo is chiefly, I might say exclusively, identified in the\r\ngeneral mind with gambling, and was indeed at the outset but a gambling\r\nresort, it long ago outgrew the limits of the Casino, becoming a Mecca\r\nof the world of fashion as well as the world of sport. Half the ruling\r\nsovereigns of Europe and all the leaders of European swelldom, the more\r\nprosperous of the demi-mondaines and no end of the merely rich of every\r\nland, congregate there and thereabouts. At the top of the season the show\r\nof opulence and impudence is bewildering.\r\n\r\nThe little principality of Monaco is hardly bigger than the Cabbage Patch\r\nof the renowned Mrs. Wiggs. It is, however, more happily situate. Nestled\r\nunder the heights of La Condamine and Tête de Chien and looking across\r\na sheltered bay upon the wide and blue Mediterranean, it has better\r\nprotection against the winds of the North than Nice, or Cannes, or Mentone.\r\nIt is an appanage--in point of fact the only estate--remaining to the once\r\npowerful Grimaldi family.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of land-piracy Old Man Grimaldi held his own with Old Man\r\nHohenzollern and Old Man Hapsburg. The Savoys and the Bourbons were kith\r\nand kin. But in the long run of Freebooting the Grimaldis did not keep\r\nup with the procession. How they retained even this remnant of inherited\r\nbrigandage and self-appointed royalty, I do not know. They are here under\r\nleave of the Powers and the especial protection, strange to say, of the\r\nFrench Republic.\r\n\r\nSomething over fifty years ago, being hard-up for cash, the Grimaldi of the\r\nperiod fell under the wiles of an ingenious Alsatian gambler, Guerlac by\r\nname, who foresaw that Baden-Baden and Hombourg were approaching their\r\nfinish and that the sports must look elsewhere for their living, the idle\r\nrich for their sport. This tiny \"enclave\" in French territory presented\r\nmany advantages over the German Dukedoms. It was an independent sovereignty\r\nissuing its own coins and postage stamps. It was in proud possession of\r\na half-dozen policemen which it called its \"army.\" It was paradisaic in\r\nbeauty and climate. Its \"ruler\" was as poor as Job's turkey, but by no\r\nmeans as proud as Lucifer.\r\n\r\nThe bargain was struck. The gambler smote the rock of Monte Carlo as with a\r\nwand of enchantment and a stream of plenty burst forth. The mountain-side\r\nresponded to the touch. It chortled in its glee and blossomed as the rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region known as the Riviera comprises, as I have said, the whole\r\nland-circle of the Mediterranean Sea. But, as generally written and\r\nunderstood, it stands for the shoreline between Marseilles and Genoa. The\r\ntwo cities are connected by the Corniche Road, built by the First Napoleon,\r\nwho learned the need of it when he made his Italian campaign, and the\r\nmodern railway, the distance 260 miles, two-thirds of the way through\r\nFrance, the residue through Italy, and all of it surpassing fine.\r\n\r\nThe climate is very like that of Southern Florida. But as in Florida they\r\nhave the \"Nor'westers\" and the \"Nor'easters,\" on the Riviera they have the\r\n\"mistral.\" In Europe there is no perfect winter weather north of Spain, as\r\nin the United States none north of Cuba.\r\n\r\nI have often thought that Havana might be made a dangerous rival of Monte\r\nCarlo under the one-man power, exercising its despotism with benignant\r\nintelligence and spending its income honestly upon the development of both\r\nthe city and the island. The motley populace would probably be none the\r\nworse for it. The Government could upon a liberal tariff collect not less\r\nthan thirty-five millions of annual revenue. Twenty-five of these millions\r\nwould suffice for its own support. Ten millions a year laid out upon\r\nharbors, roadways and internal improvements in general would within ten\r\nyears make the Queen of the Antilles the garden spot and playground of\r\nChristendom. They would build a Casino to outshine even the architectural\r\nmiracles of Charles Garnier. Then would Havana put Cairo out of business\r\nand give the Prince of Monaco a run for his money.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of every Monte Carlo season the newspapers used to tell of\r\nthe colossal winnings of purely imaginary players. Sometimes the favored\r\nchild of chance was a Russian, sometimes an Englishman, sometimes an\r\nAmerican. He was usually a myth, of course. As Mrs. Prig observed to Mrs.\r\nCamp, \"there never was no sich person.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Garnier, the Parisian architect, came and built the Casino, next to\r\nthe Library of Congress at Washington and the Grand Opera House at Paris\r\nthe most beautiful building in the world, with incomparable gardens and\r\ncommanding esplanades to set it off and display it. Around it palatial\r\nhotels and private mansions and villas sprang into existence. Within it a\r\ngold-making wheel of fortune fabricated the wherewithal. Old Man Grimaldi\r\nin his wildest dreams of land-piracy--even Old Man Hohenzollern, or Old Man\r\nHapsburg--never conceived the like.\r\n\r\nThere is no poverty, no want, no taxes--not any sign of dilapidation or\r\nsqualor anywhere in the principality of Monaco. Yet the \"people,\" so\r\ncalled, have been known to lapse into a state of discontent. They sometimes\r\n\"yearned for freedom.\" Too well fed and cared for, too rid of dirt and\r\ndebt, too flourishing, they \"riz.\" Prosperity grew monotonous. They even\r\nhad the nerve to demand a \"Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe reigning Prince was what Yellowplush would call \"a scientific gent.\"\r\nHis son and heir, however, had not his head in the clouds, being in point\r\nof fact of the earth earthly, and, of consequence, more popular than his\r\nfather. He came down from the Castle on the hill to the marketplace in the\r\ntown and says he: \"What do you galoots want, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nFirst, their \"rights.\" Then a change in the commander-in-chief of the army,\r\nwhich had grown from six to sixteen. Finally, a Board of Aldermen and a\r\nCommon Council.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" says his Royal Highness. They said it was. \"Then,\" says he,\r\n\"take it, mes enfants, and bless you!\"\r\n\r\nSo, all went well again. The toy sovereignty began to rattle around in its\r\nown conceit, the \"people\" regarded themselves, and wished to be regarded,\r\nas a chartered Democracy. The little gim-crack economic system experienced\r\nthe joys of reform. A \"New Nationalism\" was established in the brewery down\r\nby the railway station and a reciprocity treaty was negotiated between the\r\nCasino and Vanity Fair, witnessing the introduction of two roulette tables\r\nand an extra brazier for cigar stumps.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince of Monaco stood on one point. He would have no Committee on\r\nCredentials. He told me once that he had heard of Tom Reed and Champ Clark\r\nand Uncle Joe Cannon, but that he preferred Uncle Joe. He would, and he\r\ndid, name his own committees both in the Board of Aldermen and the Common\r\nCouncil. Thus, for the time being, \"insurgency\" was quelled. And once more\r\nserenely sat the Castle on the hill hard by the Cathedral. Calmly again\r\nflowed the waters in the harbor. More and more the autos honked outside the\r\nCasino. Within \"the little ball ever goes merrily round,\" and according to\r\nthe croupiers and the society reporters \"the gentleman wins and the poor\r\ngambler loses!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, I recall when on a certain season the lucky sport of print\r\nand fancy was an Englishman. In one of those farragos of stupidity and\r\ninaccuracy which are syndicated and sent from abroad to America, I found\r\nthe following piece with the stuff and nonsense habitually worked off on\r\nthe American press as \"foreign correspondence\":\r\n\r\n\"Now and then the newspapers report authentic instances of large sums\r\nhaving been won at the gaming tables at Monte Carlo. One of the most\r\nfortunate players at Monte Carlo for a long time past has been a Mr.\r\nDarnbrough, an Englishman, whose remarkable run of luck had furnished the\r\nmorsels of gossip in the capitals of Continental Europe recently.\r\n\r\n\"If reports are true, he left the place with the snug sum of more than\r\n1,000,000 francs to the good as the result of a month's play. But this, I\r\nhear, did not represent all of Mr. Darnbrough's winnings. The story goes\r\nthat on the opening day of his play he staked 24,000 francs, winning all\r\nalong the line. Emboldened by his success, he continued playing, winning\r\nagain and again with marvelous luck. At one period, it is said, his credit\r\nbalance amounted to no less than 1,850,000 francs; but from that moment\r\nDame Fortune ceased to smile upon him. He lost steadily from 200,000 to\r\n300,000 francs a day, until, recognizing that luck had turned against him,\r\nhe had sufficient strength of will to turn his back on the tables and\r\nstrike for home with the very substantial winnings that still remained.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion a well-known London stock broker walked off with\r\nlittle short of £40,000. This remarkable performance occasioned no small\r\namount of excitement in the gambling rooms, as such an unusual incident\r\ndoes invariably.\r\n\r\n\"Bent on making a 'plunge,' he went from one table to another, placing the\r\nmaximum stake on the same number. Strange to relate, at each table the same\r\nnumber won, and it was his number. Recognizing that this perhaps might be\r\nhis lucky day, the player wended his way to the trente-et-quarante room\r\nand put the maximum on three of the tables there. To his amazement, he\r\ndiscovered that there also he had been so fortunate as to select the\r\nwinning number.\r\n\r\n\"The head croupier confided to a friend of the writer who happened to be\r\npresent that that day had been the worst in the history of the Monaco bank\r\nfor years. He it was also who mentioned the amount won by the fortunate\r\nLondoner, as given above.\"\r\n\r\nIt is prudent of the space-writers to ascribe such \"information\" as this\r\nto \"the head croupier,\" because it is precisely the like that such an\r\nauthority would give out. People upon the spot know that nothing of the\r\nkind happened, and that no person of that name had appeared upon the scene.\r\nThe story on the face of it bears to the knowing its own refutation, being\r\nabsurd in every detail. As if conscious of this, the author proceeds to\r\nquality it in the following:\r\n\r\n\"It is a well-known fact that one of the most successful players at the\r\nMonte Carlo tables was Wells, who as the once popular music-hall song put\r\nit, 'broke the bank' there. He was at the zenith of his fame, about twenty\r\nyears ago, when his escapades--and winnings--were talked about widely and\r\nenvied in European sporting circles and among the demi-monde.\r\n\r\n\"In ten days, it was said, he made upward of £35,000 clear winnings at\r\nthe tables after starting with the modest capital of £400. It must not be\r\nforgotten, however, that at his trial later Wells denied this, stating\r\nthat all he had made was £7,000 at four consecutive sittings. He made the\r\nstatement that, even so, he had been a loser in the end.\r\n\r\n\"The reader may take his choice of the two statements, but among\r\nfrequenters of the rooms at Monte Carlo it is generally considered\r\nimpossible to amass large winnings without risking large stakes. Even then\r\nthe chances are 1,000 to 1 in favor of the bank. Yet occasionally there\r\nare winnings running into four or five figures, and to human beings the\r\npossibility of chance constitutes an irresistible fascination.\r\n\r\n\"Only a few years ago a young American was credited with having risen from\r\nthe tables $75,000 richer than when first he had sat down. It was his first\r\nvisit to Monte Carlo and he had not come with any system to break the bank\r\nor with any 'get-rich-quick' idea. For the novelty of the thing he risked\r\nabout $4,000, and lost it all in one fell swoop without turning a hair.\r\nThen he 'plunged' with double that amount, but the best part of that, too,\r\nwent the same way. Nothing daunted, he next ventured $10,000. This time\r\nfickle fortune favored him. He played on with growing confidence and when\r\nhis winnings amounted to the respectable sum of $75,000 he had the good\r\nsense to quit and to leave the place despite the temptation to continue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo,\" and gave occasion for the\r\nsong, was not named \"Wells\" and he was not an Englishman. He was an\r\nAmerican. I knew him well and soon after the event had from his own lips\r\nthe whole story.\r\n\r\nHe came to Monte Carlo with a good deal of money won at draw-poker in a\r\nclub at Paris and went away richer by some 100,000 francs (about $20,000)\r\nthan he came.\r\n\r\nThe catch-line of the song is misleading. There is no such thing as\r\n\"breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.\" This particular player won so fast upon\r\ntwo or three \"spins\" that the table at which he played had to suspend until\r\nit could be replenished by another \"bank,\" perhaps ten minutes in point of\r\ntime. There used to be some twenty tables. Just how one man could play at\r\nmore than one of them at one time a \"foreign correspondent,\" but only\r\na \"foreign correspondent,\" might explain to the satisfaction of the\r\nhorse-marines.\r\n\r\nI very much doubt whether any player ever won more than 100,000 francs at a\r\nsingle sitting. To do even that he must plunge like a ship in a hurricane.\r\nThere is, of course, a saving limit set by the Casino Company upon the\r\nplay. It is to the interest of the Casino to cultivate the idea, and the\r\nletter writers are willing tools. Not only at Monte Carlo, but everywhere,\r\nin dearth of news, gambling stories come cheap and easy. And the cheaper\r\nthe story the bigger the play. \"The Jedge raised him two thousand dollars.\r\nThe Colonel raised him back ten thousand more. Both of 'em stood pat. The\r\nJedge bet him a hundred thousand. The Colonel called. 'What you got?' says\r\nhe. 'Ace high,' says the Jedge; 'what you got?' 'Pair o' deuces,' says the\r\nColonel.\"\r\n\r\nAssuredly the \"play\" in the Casino is entirely fair. It could hardly be\r\notherwise with such crowds of players at the tables, often covering the\r\nwhole \"layout.\" But there is no such thing as \"honest gambling.\" The\r\n\"house\" must have \"the best of it.\" A famous American gambler, when I had\r\nreferred to one of his guild, lately deceased, as \"an honest gambler,\" said\r\nto me: \"What do you mean by 'an honest gambler'?\"\r\n\r\n\"A gambler who will not take unfair advantage!\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"the gambler must have his advantage, because gambling is\r\nhis livelihood. He must fit himself for its profitable pursuit by learning\r\nall the tricks of trade like other artists and artificers. With him it is\r\nwin or starve.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the variegate crowds that thronged the highways and byways of Monte\r\nCarlo in those days there was no single figure more observed and striking\r\nthan that of Leopold the Second, King of the Belgians. He had a bungalow\r\noverlooking the sea where he lived three months of the year like a country\r\ngentleman. Although I have made it a rule to avoid courts and courtiers,\r\nan event brought me into acquaintance with this best abused man in Europe,\r\nenabling me to form my own estimate of his very interesting personality.\r\n\r\nHe was not at all what his enemies represented him to be, a sot, a gambler\r\nand a roué. In appearance a benignant burgomaster, tall and stalwart; in\r\nmanner and voice very gentle, he should be described as first of all a man\r\nof business. His weakness was rather for money than women. Speaking of\r\nthe most famous of the Parisian dancers with whom his name had been\r\nscandalously associated, he told me that he had never met her but once in\r\nhis life, and that after the newspaper gossips had been busy for years with\r\ntheir alleged love affair. \"I kissed her hand,\" he related, \"and bade her\r\nadieu, saying, 'Ah, ma'mselle, you and I have indeed reason to congratulate\r\nourselves.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Congo business that lay at the bottom of the abuse of Leopold.\r\nHenry Stanley had put him up to this. It turned out a gold mine, and then\r\ntwo streams of defamation were let loose; one from the covetous commercial\r\nstandpoint and the other from the humanitarian. Between them, seeking to\r\ndrive him out, they depicted him as a monster of cruelty and depravity.\r\n\r\nA King must be an anchorite to escape calumny, and Leopold was not an\r\nanchorite. I asked him why I never saw him in the Casino. \"Play,\" he\r\nanswered, \"does not interest me. Besides, I do not enjoy being talked\r\nabout. Nor do I think the game they play there quite fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way do you consider it unfair, your Majesty?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the zero,\" he replied. \"At the Brussels Casino I do not allow them to\r\nhave a zero. Come and see me and I will show you a perfectly equal chance\r\nfor your money, to win or lose.\"\r\n\r\nYears after I was in Brussels. Leopold had gone to his account and his\r\nnephew, Albert, had come to the throne. There was not a roulette table in\r\nthe Casino, but there was one conveniently adjacent thereto, managed by a\r\nclique of New York gamblers, which had both a single \"and a double O,\"\r\nand, as appeared when the municipality made a descent upon the place, was\r\ningeniously wired to throw the ball wherever the presiding coupier wanted\r\nit to go.\r\n\r\nI do not believe, however, that Leopold was a party to this, or could have\r\nhad any knowledge of it. He was a skillful, not a dishonest, business man,\r\nwho showed his foresight when he listened to Stanley and took him under his\r\nwing. If the Congo had turned out worthless nobody would ever have heard of\r\nthe delinquencies of the King of the Belgians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Seventeenth\r\n\r\n    A Parisian _Pension_--The Widow of Walewska--Napoleon's\r\n    Daughter-in-Law--The Changeless--A Moral and Orderly City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that I knew the widow of Walewska, the natural son of Napoleon\r\nBonaparte by the Polish countess he picked up in Warsaw, who followed him\r\nto Paris; and thereby hangs a tale which may not be without interest.\r\n\r\nIn each of our many sojourns in Paris my wife and I had taken an apartment,\r\nliving the while in the restaurants, at first the cheaper, like the Café de\r\nProgress and the Duval places; then the Boeuf à la Mode, the Café Voisin\r\nand the Café Anglais, with Champoux's, in the Place de la Bourse, for a\r\nregular luncheon resort.\r\n\r\nAt length, the children something more than half grown, I said: \"We have\r\nnever tried a Paris _pension_.\"\r\n\r\nSo with a half dozen recommended addresses we set out on a house hunt. We\r\nhad not gone far when our search was rewarded by a veritable find. This\r\nwas on the Avenue de Courcelles, not far from the Pare Monceau; newly\r\nfurnished; reasonable charges; the lady manager a beautiful well-mannered\r\nwoman, half Scotch and half French.\r\n\r\nWe moved in. When dinner was called the boarders assembled in the very\r\nelegant drawing-room. Madame presented us to Baron ----. Then followed\r\nintroductions to Madame la Duchesse and Madame la Princesse and Madame la\r\nComtesse. Then the folding doors opened and dinner was announced.\r\n\r\nThe baron sat at the center of the table. The meal consisted of eight or\r\nten courses, served as if at a private house, and of surpassing quality.\r\nDuring the three months that we remained there was no evidence of a\r\nboarding house. It appeared an aristocratic family into which we had been\r\nhospitably admitted. The baron was a delightful person. Madame la Duchesse\r\nwas the mother of Madame la Princesse, and both were charming. The\r\nComtesse, the Napoleonic widow, was at first a little formal, but she came\r\nround after we had got acquainted, and, when we took our departure, it was\r\nlike leaving a veritable domestic circle.\r\n\r\nYears after we had the sequel. The baron, a poor young nobleman, had come\r\ninto a little money. He thought to make it breed. He had an equally poor\r\nScotch cousin, who undertook to play hostess. Both the Duchess and the\r\nCountess were his kinswomen. How could such a ménage last?\r\n\r\nHe lost his all. What became of our fellow-lodgers I never learned, but the\r\nventure coming to naught, the last I heard of the beautiful high-bred\r\nlady manager, she was serving as a stewardess on an ocean liner. Nothing,\r\nhowever, could exceed the luxury, the felicity and the good company\r\nof those memorable three months _chez l'Avenue de Courcelles, Pare\r\nMonceau_.\r\n\r\nWe never tried a _pension_ again. We chose a delightful hotel in the\r\nRue de Castiglione off the Rue de Rivoli, and remained there as fixtures\r\nuntil we were reckoned the oldest inhabitants. But we never deserted the\r\ndear old Boeuf à la Mode, which we lived to see one of the most flourishing\r\nand popular places in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old days there was a little hotel on the Rue Dannou, midway between\r\nthe Rue de la Paix and what later along became the Avenue de l'Opéra,\r\ncalled the Hôtel d'Orient. It was conducted by a certain Madame Hougenin,\r\nwhose family had held the lease for more than a hundred years, and was\r\ntypical of what the comfort-seeking visitor, somewhat initiate, might find\r\nbefore the modern tourist onrush overflowed all bounds and effaced the\r\nancient landmarks--or should I say townmarks?--making a resort instead of a\r\nhome of the gay French capital. The d'Orient was delightfully comfortable\r\nand fabulously cheap.\r\n\r\nThe wayfarer entered a darksome passage that led to an inner court. There\r\nwere on the four sides of this seven or eight stories pierced by many\r\nwindows. There was never a lift, or what we Americans call an elevator. If\r\nyou wanted to go up you walked up; and after dark your single illuminant\r\nwas candlelight. The service could hardly be recommended, but cleanliness\r\nherself could find no fault with the beds and bedding; nor any queer people\r\nabout; changeless; as still and stationary as a nook in the Rockies.\r\n\r\nA young girl might dwell there year in and year out in perfect safety--many\r\nyoung girls did so--madame a kind of duenna. The food--for it was a\r\n_pension_--was all a gourmet could desire. And the wine!\r\n\r\nI was lunching with an old Parisian friend.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of this vintage?\" says he.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" I answered. \"Come and dine with me to-morrow and I will give\r\nyou the mate to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--at the d'Orient?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at the d'Orient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Preposterous!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he came. When the wine was poured out he took a sip.\r\n\r\n\"By ----!\" he exclaimed. \"That is good, isn't it? I wonder where they got\r\nit? And how?\"\r\n\r\nDuring the week after we had it every day. Then no more. The headwaiter,\r\nwith many apologies, explained that he had found those few bottles in a\r\nforgotten bin, where they had lain for years, and he begged a thousand\r\npardons of monsieur, but we had drunk them all--_rien du plus_--no\r\nmore. I might add that precisely the same thing happened to me at the Hôtel\r\nContinental. Indeed, it is not uncommon with the French caravansaries\r\nto keep a little extra good wine in stock for those who can distinguish\r\nbetween an _ordinaire_ and a _supérieur_, and are willing to pay\r\nthe price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"See Naples and die,\" say the Italians. \"See Paris and live,\" say the\r\nFrench. Old friends, who have been over and back, have been of late telling\r\nme that Paris, having woefully suffered, is nowise the Paris it was, and\r\nas the provisional offspring of four years of desolating war I can well\r\nbelieve them. But a year or two of peace, and the city will rise again,\r\nas after the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune, which laid upon it a\r\nsufficiently blighting hand. In spite of fickle fortune and its many ups\r\nand downs it is, and will ever remain, \"Paris, the Changeless.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw the town so much itself as just before the beginning of the\r\nworld war. I took my departure in the early summer of that fateful year and\r\nleft all things booming--not a sign or trace that there had ever been aught\r\nbut boundless happiness and prosperity. It is hard, the saying has it,\r\nto keep a squirrel on the ground, and surely Paris is the squirrel among\r\ncities. The season just ended had been, everybody declared, uncommonly\r\nsuccessful from the standpoints alike of the hotels and cafés, the shop\r\nfolk and their patrons, not to mention the purely pleasure-seeking throng.\r\nPeople seemed loaded with money and giddy to spend it.\r\n\r\nThe headwaiter at Voisin's told me this: \"Mr. Barnes, of New York, ordered\r\na dinner, carte blanche, for twelve.\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' says he, 'garçon, have everything bang up, and here's seventy-five\r\nfrancs for a starter.'\r\n\r\n\"The dinner was bang up. Everybody hilarious. Mr. Barnes immensely pleased.\r\nWhen he came to pay his bill, which was a corker, he made no objection.\r\n\r\n\"'Garçon,' says he, 'if I ask you a question will you tell me the truth?'\r\n\r\n\"'_Oui, monsieur; certainement._'\r\n\r\n\"Well, how much was the largest tip you ever received?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-five francs, monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Very well; here are 100 francs.'\r\n\r\n\"Then, after a pause for the waiter to digest his joy and express a proper\r\nsense of gratitude and wonder, Mr. Barnes came to time with: 'Do you\r\nremember who was the idiot that paid you the seventy-five francs?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, yes, monsieur. It was you.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has occurred to me that of late years--I mean the years immediately\r\nbefore 1914--Paris has been rather more bent upon adapting itself to human\r\nand moral as well as scientific progress. There has certainly been less\r\ndebauchery visible to the naked eye. I was assured that the patronage had\r\nso fallen away from the Moulin Rouge that they were planning to turn it\r\ninto a decent theater. Nor during my sojourn did anybody in my hearing so\r\nmuch as mention the Dead Rat. I doubt whether it is still in existence.\r\n\r\nThe last time I was in Maxim's--quite a dozen years ago now--a young woman\r\nsat next to me whose story could be read in her face. She was a pretty\r\nthing not five and twenty, still blooming, with iron-gray hair. It had\r\nturned in a night, I was told. She had recently come from Baltimore and\r\nknew no more what she was doing or whither she was drifting than a baby.\r\nThe old, old story: a comfortable home and a good husband; even a child or\r\ntwo; a scoundrel, a scandal, an elopement, and the inevitable desertion.\r\nLeft without a dollar in the streets of Paris. She was under convoy of a\r\nnoted procuress.\r\n\r\n\"A duke or the morgue,\" she whimpered, \"in six months.\"\r\n\r\nThree months sufficed. They dragged all that remained of her out of the\r\nSeine, and then the whole of the pitiful disgrace and tragedy came out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIf ever I indite a volume to be entitled Adventures in Paris it will\r\ncontain not a line to feed any prurient fancy, but will embrace the record\r\nof many little journeys between the Coiffeur and the Marché des Fleurs,\r\nwith maybe an excursion among the cemeteries and the restaurants.\r\n\r\nEach city is as one makes it for himself. Paris has contributed greatly to\r\nmy appreciation, and perhaps my knowledge, of history and literature and\r\nart and life. I have seen it in all its aspects; under the empire, when the\r\nDue de Morny was king of the Bourse and Mexico was to make every Frenchman\r\nrich; after the commune and the siege, when the Hôtel de Ville was in\r\nruins, the palace of the Tuileries still aflame, the column gone from the\r\nPlace Vendôme, and everything a blight and waste; and I have marked it rise\r\nfrom its ashes, grandly, proudly, and like a queen come to her own again,\r\nresume its primacy as the only complete metropolis in all the universe.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying it. No city can approach Paris in structural unity and\r\nregality, in things brilliant and beautiful, in buoyancy, variety, charm\r\nand creature comfort. Drunkenness, of the kind familiar to London and New\r\nYork, is invisible to Paris. The brandy and absinthe habit has been greatly\r\nexaggerated. In truth, everywhere in Europe the use of intoxicants is on\r\nthe decline. They are, for the first time in France, stimulated partly\r\nby the alarming adulteration of French wines, rigorously applying and\r\nenforcing the pure-food laws.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, there is a palpable and decided improvement of the\r\nvintage of the Garonne and the Champagne country. One may get a good glass\r\nof wine now without impoverishing himself. As men drink wine, and as the\r\nwine is pure, they fall away from stronger drink. I have always considered,\r\nwith Jefferson, the brewery in America an excellent temperance society.\r\nThat which works otherwise is the dive which too often the brewery fathers.\r\nThey are drinking more beer in France--even making a fairly good beer. And\r\nthen--\r\n\r\nBut gracious, this is getting upon things controversial, and if there is\r\nanything in this world that I do hybominate, it is controversy!\r\n\r\nFew of the wondrous changes which the Age of Miracles has wrought in my day\r\nand generation exceeded those of ocean travel. The modern liner is but a\r\nmoving palace. Between the ports of the Old World and the ports of the\r\nnew the transit is so uneventful as to grow monotonous. There are no more\r\nadventures on the high seas. The ocean is a thoroughfare, the crossing a\r\nferry. My experience forty years ago upon one of the ancient tubs which\r\nhave been supplanted by these liners would make queer reading to the\r\nlatter-day tourist, taking, let us say, any one of the steamers of any one\r\nof the leading transatlantic companies. The difference in the appointments\r\nof the William Penn of 1865 and the star boats of 1914 is indescribable.\r\nIt seems a fairy tale to think of a palm garden where the ladies dress for\r\ndinner, a Hungarian band which plays for them whilst they dine, and a sky\r\nparlor where they go after dinner for their coffee and what not; a tea-room\r\nfor the five-o'clockers; and except in excessive weather scarcely any\r\nmotion at all. It is this palm garden which most appeals to a certain lady\r\nof my very intimate acquaintance who had made many crossings and never gone\r\nto her meals--sick from shore to shore--until the gods ordained for her a\r\nwatery, winery, flowery paradise--where the billows ceased from troubling\r\nand a woman could appear at her best. Since then she has sailed many times,\r\nlodged à la Waldorf-Astoria to eat her victuals and sip her wine with\r\nperfect contentment. Coming ashore from our last crossing a friend found\r\nher in the Red Room of that hostel just as she had been sitting the evening\r\nbefore on shipboard.\r\n\r\n\"Seems hardly any motion at all,\" she said, looking about her and fancying\r\nherself still at sea, as well she might.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Eighteenth\r\n\r\n    The Grover Cleveland Period--President Arthur and Mr. Blaine--John\r\n    Chamberlin--The Decrees of Destiny\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the Grover Cleveland period of American politics began\r\nwith the election of that extraordinary person--another man of destiny--to\r\nthe governorship of New York. Nominated, as it were, by chance, he carried\r\nthe State by an unprecedented majority. That was not because of his\r\npopularity, but that an incredible number of Republican voters refused\r\nto support their party ticket and stayed away from the polls. The\r\nBlaine-Conkling feud, inflamed by the murder of Garfield, had rent the\r\nparty of Lincoln and Grant asunder. Arthur, a Conkling leader, had\r\nsucceeded to the presidency.\r\n\r\nIf any human agency could have sealed the breach he might have done it. No\r\nman, however, can achieve the impossible. The case was hopeless.\r\n\r\nArthur was a man of surpassing sweetness and grace. As handsome as Pierce,\r\nas affable as McKinley, he was a more experienced and dextrous politician\r\nthan either. He had been put on the ticket with Garfield to placate\r\nConkling. All sorts of stories to his discredit were told during the\r\nensuing campaign. The Democrats made him out a tricky and typical \"New York\r\npolitician.\" In point of fact he was a many-sided, accomplished man who\r\nhad a taking way of adjusting all conditions and adapting himself to all\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nWith a sister as charming and tactful as he for head of his domestic\r\nfabric, the White House bloomed again. He possessed the knack of\r\nsurrounding himself with all sorts of agreeable people. Frederick\r\nFrelinghuysen was Secretary of State and Robert Lincoln, continued from the\r\nGarfield Cabinet, Secretary of War. Then there were three irresistibles:\r\nWalter Gresham, Frank Hatton and \"Ben\" Brewster. His home\r\ncontingent--\"Clint\" Wheeler, \"Steve\" French, and \"Jake\" Hess--pictured as\r\n\"ward heelers\"--were, in reality, efficient and all-around, companionable\r\nmen, capable and loyal.\r\n\r\nI was sent by the Associated Press to Washington on a fool's errand--that\r\nis, to get an act of Congress extending copyright to the news of the\r\nassociation--and, remaining the entire session, my business to meet the\r\nofficial great and to make myself acceptable, I came into a certain\r\nintimacy with the Administration circle, having long had friendly relations\r\nwith the President. In all my life I have never passed so delightful and\r\nuseless a winter.\r\n\r\nVery early in the action I found that my mission involved a serious and\r\nvexed question--nothing less than the creation of a new property--and I\r\nproceeded warily. Through my uncle, Stanley Matthews, I interested the\r\nmembers of the Supreme Court. The Attorney General, a great lawyer and\r\nan old Philadelphia friend, was at my call and elbow. The Joint Library\r\nCommittee of Congress, to which the measure must go, was with me. Yet\r\nsomehow the scheme lagged.\r\n\r\nI could not account for this. One evening at a dinner Mr. Blaine\r\nenlightened me. We sat together at table and suddenly he turned and said:\r\n\"How are you getting on with your bill?\" And my reply being rather halting,\r\nhe continued, \"You won't get a vote in either House,\" and he proceeded\r\nvery humorously to improvise the average member's argument against it as\r\na dangerous power, a perquisite to the great newspapers and an imposition\r\nupon the little ones. To my mind this was something more than the\r\npost-prandial levity it was meant to be.\r\n\r\nNot long after a learned but dissolute old lawyer said to me, \"You need no\r\nact of Congress to protect your news service. There are at least two, and I\r\nthink four or five, English rulings that cover the case. Let me show them\r\nto you.\" He did so and I went no further with the business, quite agreeing\r\nwith Mr. Blaine, and nothing further came of it. To a recent date the\r\nAssociated Press has relied on these decisions under the common law of\r\nEngland. Curiously enough, quite a number of newspapers in whose actual\r\nservice I was engaged, opened fire upon me and roundly abused me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere appeared upon the scene in Washington toward the middle of the\r\nseventies one of those problematical characters the fiction-mongers delight\r\nin. This was John Chamberlin. During two decades \"Chamberlin's,\" half\r\nclubhouse and half chophouse, was all a rendezvous.\r\n\r\n\"John\" had been a gambler; first an underling and then a partner of the\r\nfamous Morrissy-McGrath racing combination at Saratoga and Long Branch.\r\nThere was a time when he was literally rolling in wealth. Then he went\r\nbroke--dead broke. Black Friday began it and the panic of '73 finished\r\nit. He came over to Washington and his friends got him the restaurant\r\nprivileges of the House of Representatives. With this for a starting point,\r\nhe was able to take the Fernando Wood residence, in the heart of the\r\nfashionable quarter, to add to it presently the adjoining dwelling of\r\nGovernor Swann, of Maryland, and next to that, finally, the Blaine\r\nmansion, making a suite, as it were, elegant yet cozy. \"Welcker's,\" erst a\r\nfashionable resort, and long the best eating-place in town, had been ruined\r\nby a scandal, and \"Chamberlin's\" succeeded it, having the field to itself,\r\nthough, mindful of the \"scandal\" which had made its opportunity, ladies\r\nwere barred.\r\n\r\nThere was a famous cook--Emeline Simmons--a mulatto woman, who was equally\r\nat home in French dishes and Maryland-Virginia kitchen mysteries--a very\r\nwonder with canvasback and terrapin--who later refused a great money offer\r\nto he chef at the White House--whom John was able to secure. Nothing could\r\nsurpass--could equal--her preparations. The charges, like the victuals,\r\nwere sky-high and tip-top. The service was handled by three \"colored\r\ngentlemen,\" as distinguished in manners as in appearance, who were known\r\nfar and wide by name and who dominated all about them, including John and\r\nhis patrons.\r\n\r\nNo such place ever existed before, or will ever exist again. It was the\r\npersonality of John Chamberlin, pervasive yet invisible, exhaling a silent,\r\nwelcoming radiance. General Grant once said to me, \"During my eight years\r\nin the White House, John Chamberlin once in a while--once in a great\r\nwhile--came over. He did not ask for anything. He just told me what to do,\r\nand I did it.\" I mentioned this to President Arthur. \"Well,\" he laughingly\r\nsaid, \"that has been my experience with John Chamberlin. It never crosses\r\nmy mind to say him 'nay.' Often I have turned this over in my thought\r\nto reach the conclusion that being a man of sound judgment and worldly\r\nknowledge, he has fully considered the case--his case and my case--leaving\r\nme no reasonable objection to interpose.\"\r\n\r\nJohn obtained an act of Congress authorizing him to build a hotel on the\r\nGovernment reservation at Fortress Monroe, and another of the Virginia\r\nLegislature confirming this for the State. Then he came to me. It was at\r\nthe moment when I was flourishing as \"a Wall Street magnate.\" He said: \"I\r\nwant to sell this franchise to some man, or company, rich enough to carry\r\nit through. All I expect is a nest egg for Emily and the girls\"--he had\r\nmarried the beautiful Emily Thorn, widow of George Jordan, the actor, and\r\nthere were two daughters--\"you are hand-and-glove with the millionaires.\r\nWon't you manage it for me?\" Like Grant and Arthur, I never thought of\r\nrefusing. Upon the understanding that I was to receive no commission, I\r\nagreed, first ascertaining that it was really a most valuable franchise.\r\n\r\nI began with the Willards, in whose hotel I had grown up. They were rich\r\nand going out of business. Then I laid it before Hitchcock and Darling, of\r\nthe Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York. They, rich like the Willards, were\r\nalso retiring. Then a bright thought occurred to me. I went to the Prince\r\nImperial of Standard Oil. \"Mr. Flagler,\" I said, \"you have hotels at St.\r\nAugustine and you have hotels at Palm Beach. Here is a halfway point\r\nbetween New York and Florida,\" and more of the same sort. \"My dear friend,\"\r\nhe answered, \"every man has the right to make a fool of himself once in his\r\nlife. This I have already done. Never again for me. I have put up my\r\nlast dollar south of the Potomac.\" Then I went to the King of the\r\ntranscontinental railways. \"Mr. Huntington,\" I said, \"you own a road\r\nextending from St. Louis to Newport News, having a terminal in a cornfield\r\njust out of Hampton Roads. Here is a franchise which gives you a\r\nmagnificent site at Hampton Roads itself. Why not?\" He gazed upon me with\r\na blank stare--such I fancy as he usually turned upon his suppliants--and\r\nslowly replied: \"I would not spend another dollar in Virginia if the Lord\r\ncommanded me. In the event that some supernatural power should take the\r\nChesapeake & Ohio Railway by the nape of the neck and the seat of the\r\nbreeches and pitch it out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean it would be\r\ndoing me a favor.\"\r\n\r\nSo I returned John his franchise marked \"nothing doing.\" Afterward he put\r\nit in the hands of a very near friend, a great capitalist, who had no\r\nbetter luck with it. Finally, here and there, literally by piecemeal, he\r\ngot together money enough to build and furnish the Hotel Chamberlin, had a\r\nnotable opening with half of Congress there to see, and gently laid himself\r\ndown and died, leaving little other than friends and debts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMacaulay tells us that the dinner-table is a wondrous peacemaker, miracle\r\nworker, social solvent; and many were the quarrels composed and the plans\r\nperfected under the Chamberlin roof. It became a kind of Congressional\r\nExchange with a close White House connection. If those old walls, which by\r\nthe way are still standing, could speak, what tales they might tell, what\r\ntestimonies refute, what new lights throw into the vacant corners and dark\r\nplaces of history!\r\n\r\nComing away from Chamberlin's with Mr. Blaine for an after-dinner stroll\r\nduring the winter of 1883-4, referring to the approaching National\r\nRepublican Convention, he said: \"I do not want the nomination. In my\r\nopinion there is but one nominee the Republicans can elect this year and\r\nthat is General Sherman. I have written him to tell him so and urge it upon\r\nhim. In default of him the time of you people has come.\" He subsequently\r\nshowed me this letter and General Sherman's reply. My recollection is that\r\nthe General declared that he would not take the presidency if it were\r\noffered him, earnestly invoking Mr. Elaine to support his brother, John\r\nSherman.\r\n\r\nThis would seem clear refutation that Mr. Blaine was party to his own\r\nnomination that year. It assuredly reveals keen political instinct and\r\nforesight. The capital prize in the national lottery was not for him.\r\n\r\nI did not meet him until two years later, when he gave me a minute account\r\nof what had happened immediately thereafter; the swing around the circle;\r\nBelshazzar's feast, as a fatal New York banquet was called; the far-famed\r\nBurchard incident. \"I did not hear the words, 'Rum, Romanism and\r\nRebellion,'\" he told me, \"else, as you must know, I would have fittingly\r\ndisposed of them.\"\r\n\r\nI said: \"Mr. Blaine, you may as well give it up. The doom of Webster,\r\nClay, and Douglas is upon you. If you are nominated again, with an assured\r\nelection, you will die before the day of election. If you survive the day\r\nand are elected, you'll die before the 4th of March.\" He smiled grimly and\r\nreplied: \"It really looks that way.\"\r\n\r\nMy own opinion has always been that if the Republicans had nominated\r\nMr. Arthur in 1884 they would have elected him. The New York vote would\r\nscarcely have been so close. In the count of the vote the Arthur end of\r\nit would have had some advantage--certainly no disadvantage. Cleveland's\r\nnearly 200,000 majority had dwindled to the claim of a beggarly few\r\nhundred, and it was charged that votes which belonged to Butler, who ran as\r\nan independent labor candidate, were actually counted for Cleveland.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over an old Republican friend of mine said: \"Now we are even.\r\nHistory will attest that we stole it once and you stole it once. Turn about\r\nmay be fair play; but, all the same, neither of us likes it.\"\r\n\r\nSo Grover Cleveland, unheard of outside of Buffalo two years before, was to\r\nbe President of the United States. The night preceding his nomination for\r\nthe governorship of New York, General Slocum seemed in the State convention\r\nsure of that nomination. Had he received it he would have carried the State\r\nas Cleveland did, and Slocum, not Cleveland, would have been the Chief\r\nMagistrate. It cost Providence a supreme effort to pull Cleveand through.\r\nBut in his case, as in many another, Providence \"got there\" in fulfilment\r\nof a decree of Destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Nineteenth\r\n\r\n    Mr. Cleveland in the White House--Mr. Bayard in the Department of\r\n    State--Queer Appointments to Office--The One-Party Power--The End of\r\n    North and South Sectionalism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe futility of political as well as of other human reckoning was set\r\nforth by the result of the presidential election of 1884. With a kind\r\nof prescience, as I have related, Mr. Blaine had foreseen it. He was\r\na sagacious as well as a lovable and brilliant man. He looked back\r\naffectionately upon the days he had passed in Kentucky, when a poor\r\nschool-teacher, and was especially cordial to the Kentuckians. In the House\r\nhe and Beck were sworn friends, and they continued their friendship when\r\nboth of them had reached the Senate.\r\n\r\nI inherited Mr. Blaine's desk in the Ways and Means Committee room. In one\r\nof the drawers of this he had left a parcel of forgotten papers, which\r\nI returned to him. He made a joke of the secrets they covered and the\r\nfortunate circumstance that they had fallen into the hands of a friend and\r\nnot of an enemy.\r\n\r\nNo man of his time could hold a candle to Mr. Blaine in what we call\r\nmagnetism--that is, in manly charm, supported by facility and brain power.\r\nClay and Douglas had set the standard of party leadership before his time.\r\nHe made a good third to them. I never knew Mr. Clay, but with Judge Douglas\r\nI was well acquainted, and the difference between him and Mr. Blaine in\r\nleadership might be called negligible.\r\n\r\nBoth were intellectually aggressive and individually amiable. They at least\r\nseemed to love their fellow men. Each had been tried by many adventures.\r\nEach had gone, as it were, \"through the flint mill.\" Born to good\r\nconditions--Mr. Blaine sprang from aristocratic forebears--each knew by\r\nearly albeit brief experience the seamy side of life; as each, like Clay,\r\nnursed a consuming passion for the presidency. Neither had been made for\r\na subaltern, and they chafed under the subaltern yoke to which fate had\r\ncondemned them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Grover Cleveland a total stranger had arrived at the front of affairs.\r\nThe Democrats, after a rule of more than half a century, had been out of\r\npower twenty-four years. They could scarce realize at first that they were\r\nagain in power. The new chieftain proved more of an unknown quantity than\r\nhad been suspected. William Dorsheimer, a life-long crony, had brought the\r\ntwo of us together before Cleveland's election to the governorship of the\r\nEmpire State as one of a group of attractive Buffalo men, most of whom\r\nmight be said to have been cronies of mine, Buffalo being a delightful\r\nhalfway stop-over in my frequent migrations between Kentucky and the\r\nEastern seaboard. As in the end we came to a parting of the ways I want to\r\nwrite of Mr. Cleveland as a historian and not as a critic.\r\n\r\nHe said to Mr. Carlisle after one of our occasional tiffs: \"Henry will\r\nnever like me until God makes me over again.\" The next time we met,\r\nreferring to this, I said: \"Mr. President, I like you very much--very much\r\nindeed--but sometimes I don't like some of your ways.\"\r\n\r\nThere were in point of fact two Clevelands--before marriage and after\r\nmarriage--the intermediate Cleveland rather unequal and indeterminate.\r\nAssuredly no one of his predecessors had entered the White House so wholly\r\nignorant of public men and national affairs. Stories used to be told\r\nassigning to Zachary Taylor this equivocal distinction. But General Taylor\r\nhad grown up in the army and advanced in the military service to a chief\r\ncommand, was more or less familiar with the party leaders of his time,\r\nand was by heredity a gentleman. The same was measurably true of Grant.\r\nCleveland confessed himself to have had no social training, and he\r\nliterally knew nobody.\r\n\r\nFive or six weeks after his inauguration I went to Washington to ask a\r\ndiplomatic appointment for my friend, Boyd Winchester. Ill health had cut\r\nshort a promising career in Congress, but Mr. Winchester was now well on to\r\nrecovery, and there seemed no reason why he should not and did not stand in\r\nthe line of preferment. My experience may be worth recording because it is\r\nillustrative.\r\n\r\nIn my quest I had not thought of going beyond Mr. Bayard, the new Secretary\r\nof State. I did go to him, but the matter seemed to make no headway. There\r\nappeared a hitch somewhere. It had not crossed my mind that it might be\r\nthe President himself. What did the President know or care about foreign\r\nappointments?\r\n\r\nHe said to me on a Saturday when I was introducing a party of Kentucky\r\nfriends: \"Come up to-morrow for luncheon. Come early, for Rose\"--his\r\nsister, for the time being mistress of the White House--\"will be at church\r\nand we can have an old-fashioned talk-it-out.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed the forenoon together. He was full of homely and\r\noften whimsical talk. He told me he had not yet realized what had happened\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I wake at night and rub my eyes and wonder if it is\r\nnot all a dream.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked an infinite number of questions about this, that and the other\r\nDemocratic politician. He was having trouble with the Kentucky Congressmen.\r\nHe had appointed a most unlikely scion of a well-known family to a foreign\r\nmission, and another young Kentuckian, the son of a New York magnate, to a\r\nleading consul generalship, without consultation with any one. He asked me\r\nabout these. In a way one of them was one of my boys, and I was glad to see\r\nhim get what he wanted, though he aspired to nothing so high. He was indeed\r\nall sorts of a boy, and his elevation to such a post was so grotesque that\r\nthe nomination, like that of his mate, was rejected by the Senate. I\r\ngave the President a serio-comic but kindly account, at which he laughed\r\nheartily, and ended by my asking how he had chanced to make two such\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\n\"Hewitt came over here,\" he answered, \"and then Dorsheimer. The father is\r\nthe only Democrat we have in that great corporation. As to the other, he\r\nstruck me as a likely fellow. It seemed good politics to gratify them and\r\ntheir friends.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested that such backing was far afield and not very safe to go by,\r\nwhen suddenly he said: \"I have been told over and over again by you and by\r\nothers that you will not take office. Too much of a lady, I suppose! What\r\nare you hanging round Washington for anyhow? What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nHere was my opportunity to speak of Winchester, and I did so.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished he said: \"What are you doing about Winchester?\"\r\n\r\n\"Relying on the Secretary of State, who served in Congress with him and\r\nknows him well.\"\r\n\r\nThen he asked: \"What do you want for Winchester?\"\r\n\r\nI answered: \"Belgium or Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\nHe said: \"I promised Switzerland for a friend of Corning's. He brought\r\nhim over here yesterday and he is an out-and-out Republican who voted for\r\nBlaine, and I shall not appoint him. If you want the place for Winchester,\r\nWinchester it is.\"\r\n\r\nNext day, much to Mr. Bayard's surprise, the commission was made out.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland had a way of sudden fancies to new and sometimes queer\r\npeople. Many of his appointments were eccentric and fell like bombshells\r\nupon the Senate, taking the appointee's home people completely by surprise.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of influential politicians seemed to have little if any\r\nweight with him.\r\n\r\nThere came to Washington from Richmond a gentleman by the name of Keiley,\r\nbacked by the Virginia delegation for a minor consulship. The President at\r\nonce fell in love with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Watterson's Library at \"Mansfield\"]\r\n\r\n\"Consul be damned,\" he said. \"He is worth more than that,\" and named him\r\nAmbassador to Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that Mrs. Keiley was a Jewess and would not be received at\r\ncourt. Then he named him Ambassador to Italy, when it appeared that Keiley\r\nwas an intense Roman Catholic, who had made at least one ultramontane\r\nspeech, and would be _persona non grata_ at the Quirinal. Then\r\nCleveland dropped him. Meanwhile poor Keiley had closed out bag and baggage\r\nat Richmond and was at his wit's end. After much ado the President was\r\nbrought to a realizing sense and a place was found for Keiley as consul\r\ngeneral and diplomatic agent at Cairo, whither he repaired. At the end\r\nof the four years he came to Paris and one day, crossing the Place de la\r\nConcorde, he was run over by a truck and killed. He deserved a longer\r\ncareer and a better fate, for he was a man of real capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken to task by thick and thin Democratic partisans for my criticism of\r\nthe only two Democratic Presidents we have had since the War of Sections,\r\nCleveland and Wilson, I have answered by asserting the right and duty of\r\nthe journalist to talk out in meeting, flatly repudiating the claims as\r\nwell as the obligations of the organ grinder they had sought to put upon\r\nme, and closing with the knife grinder's retort--\r\n\r\n  _Things have come to a hell of a pass\r\n  When a man can't wallop his own jackass_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mr. Cleveland the break had come over the tariff issue.\r\nReading me his first message to Congress the day before he sent it in, he\r\nhad said: \"I know nothing about the tariff, and I thought I had best leave\r\nit where you and Morrison had put it in the platform.\"\r\n\r\nWe had indeed had a time in the Platform Committee of the Chicago\r\nconvention of 1884. After an unbroken session of fifty hours a straddle\r\nwas all that the committee could be brought to agree upon. The leading\r\nrecalcitrant had been General Butler, who was there to make trouble and who\r\nlater along bolted the ticket and ran as an independent candidate.\r\n\r\nOne aim of the Democrats was to get away from the bloody shirt as an issue.\r\nYet, as the sequel proved, it was long after Cleveland's day before the\r\nbloody shirt was laid finally to rest. It required a patriot and a hero\r\nlike William McKinley to do this. When he signed the commissions of Joseph\r\nWheeler and Fitzhugh Lee, Confederate generals and graduates of the West\r\nPoint Military Academy, to be generals in the Army of the United States,\r\nhe made official announcement that the War of Sections was over and gave\r\ncomplete amnesty to the people and the soldiers of the South.\r\n\r\nYet the bloody shirt lingered long as a troublemaker, and was invoked by\r\nboth parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThat chance gathering of heedless persons, stirred by the bombast of\r\nself-exploiting orators eager for notoriety or display--loose mobs of\r\nlocal nondescripts led by pension sharks so aptly described by the gallant\r\nGeneral Bragg, of Wisconsin, as coffee coolers and camp followers--should\r\ntear their passion to tatters with the thought that Virginia, exercising an\r\nindisputable right and violating no reasonable sensibility, should elect\r\nto send memorials of Washington and Lee for the Hall of Statues in the\r\nnation's Capitol, came in the accustomed way of bloody-shirt agitation. It\r\nmerely proved how easily men are led when taken in droves and stirred by\r\npartyism. Such men either bore no part in the fighting when fighting was\r\nthe order of the time, or else they were too ignorant and therefore too\r\nunpatriotic to comprehend the meaning of the intervening years and the\r\nglory these had brought with the expanse of national progress and prowess.\r\nIn spite of their lack of representative character it was not easy to\r\nrepress impatience at ebullitions of misguided zeal so ignoble; and of\r\ncourse it was not possible to dissuade or placate them.\r\n\r\nAll the while never a people more eager to get together than the people of\r\nthe United States after the War of Sections, as never a people so averse to\r\ngetting into that war. A very small group of extremists and doctrinaires\r\nhad in the beginning made a War of Sections possible. Enough of these\r\nsurvived in the days of Cleveland and McKinley to keep sectionalism alive.\r\n\r\nIt was mainly sectional clamor out for partisan advantage. But it made\r\nthe presidential campaigns lurid in certain quarters. There was no end of\r\nobjurgation, though it would seem that even the most embittered Northerner\r\nand ultra Republican who could couple the names of Robert E. Lee and\r\nBenedict Arnold, as was often done in campaign lingo, would not hesitate,\r\nif his passions were roused or if he fancied he saw in it some profit to\r\nhimself or his party, to liken George Washington to Judas Iscariot.\r\n\r\nThe placing of Lee's statue in the Capitol at Washington made the occasion\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nIt is true that long before Confederate officers had sat in both Houses of\r\nCongress and in Republican and Democratic cabinets and upon the bench of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and had served as ambassadors and envoys extraordinary\r\nin foreign lands. But McKinley's doing was the crowning stroke of union and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThere had been a weary and varied interim. Sectionalism proved a sturdy\r\nplant. It died hard. We may waive the reconstruction period as ancient\r\nhistory. There followed it intense party spirit. Yet, in spite of\r\nextremists and malignants on both sides of the line, the South rallied\r\nequally with the North to the nation's drumbeat after the Maine went down\r\nin the harbor of Havana. It fought as bravely and as loyally at Santiago\r\nand Manila. Finally, by the vote of the North, there came into the Chief\r\nMagistracy one who gloried in the circumstance that on the maternal side\r\nhe came of fighting Southern stock; who, amid universal applause, declared\r\nthat no Southerner could be prouder than he of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall\r\nJackson, apotheosizing an uncle, his mother's brother, who had stood at the\r\nhead of the Confederate naval establishment in Europe and had fitted out\r\nthe Confederate cruisers, as the noblest and purest man he had ever known,\r\na composite of Colonel Newcome and Henry Esmond.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the process of oblivion had gone on. The graven effigy of\r\nJefferson Davis at length appeared upon the silver service of an American\r\nbattleship. This told the Mississippi's guests, wherever and whenever they\r\nmight meet round her hospitable board, of national unification and peace,\r\ngiving the lie to sectional malignancy. In the most famous and conspicuous\r\nof the national cemeteries now stands the monument of a Confederate general\r\nnot only placed there by consent of the Government, but dedicated with\r\nfitting ceremonies supervised by the Department of War, which sent as its\r\nofficial representative the son of Grant, himself an army officer of rank\r\nand distinction.\r\n\r\nThe world has looked on, incredulous and amazed, whilst our country has\r\nrisen to each successive act in the drama of reconciliation with increasing\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nI have been all my life a Constitutional Nationalist; first the nation and\r\nthen the state. The episode of the Confederacy seems already far away. It\r\nwas an interlude, even as matters stood in the Sixties and Seventies, and\r\nnow he who would thwart the unification of the country on the lines of\r\noblivion, of mutual and reciprocal forgiveness, throws himself across the\r\nhighway of his country's future, and is a traitor equally to the essential\r\nprinciples of free government and the spirit of the age.\r\n\r\nIf sectionalism be not dead it should have no place in popular\r\nconsideration. The country seems happily at last one with itself. The\r\nSouth, like the East and the West, has come to be the merest geographic\r\nexpression. Each of its states is in the Union, precisely like the states\r\nof the East and the West, all in one and one in all. Interchanges of every\r\nsort exist.\r\n\r\nThese exchanges underlie and interlace our social, domestic and business\r\nfabric. That the arrangement and relation after half a century of strife\r\nthus established should continue through all time is the hope and prayer\r\nof every thoughtful, patriotic American. There is no greater dissonance\r\nto that sentiment in the South than in the North. To what end, therefore,\r\nexcept ignominious recrimination and ruinous dissension, could a revival of\r\nold sectional and partisan passions--if it were possible--be expected to\r\nreach?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nHumor has played no small part in our politics. It was Col. Mulberry\r\nSellers, Mark Twain's hero, who gave currency to the conceit and enunciated\r\nthe principle of \"the old flag and an appropriation.\" He did not claim the\r\nformula as his own, however. He got it, he said, of Senator Dillworthy, his\r\npatriotic file leader and ideal of Christian statesmanship.\r\n\r\nThe original of Senator Dillworthy was recognized the country over as\r\nSenator Pomeroy, of Kansas, \"Old Pom,\" as he had come to be called, whose\r\noleaginous piety and noisy patriotism, adjusting themselves with equal\r\nfacility to the purloining of subsidies and the roasting of rebels, to\r\nprayer and land grants, had impressed themselves upon the Satirist of\r\nthe Gilded Age as upon his immediate colleagues in Congress. He was a\r\nruffle-shirted Pharisee, who affected the airs of a bishop, and resembled\r\nCruikshank's pictures of Pecksniff.\r\n\r\nThere have not been many \"Old Poms\" in our public life; or, for that matter\r\nAaron Burrs either, and but one Benedict Arnold. That the chosen people of\r\nGod did not dwell amid the twilight of the ages and in far-away Judea, but\r\nwere reserved to a later time, and a region then undiscovered of men, and\r\nthat the American republic was ordained of God to illustrate upon the\r\ntheater of the New World the possibilities of free government in contrast\r\nwith the failures and tyrannies and corruptions of the Old, I do truly\r\nbelieve. That is the first article in my confession of faith. And the\r\nsecond is like unto it, that Washington was raised up by God to create it,\r\nand that Lincoln was raised up by God to save it; else why the militia\r\ncolonel of Virginia and the rail splitter of Illinois, for no reason that\r\nwas obvious at the time, before all other men? God moves in a mysterious\r\nway his wonders to perform. The star of the sublime destiny that hung over\r\nthe manager of our blessed Savior hung over the cradle of our blessed\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThus far it has weathered each historic danger which has gone before to\r\nmark the decline and fall of nations; the struggle for existence; the\r\nforeign invasion; the internecine strife; the disputed succession;\r\nreligious bigotry and racial conflict. One other peril confronts\r\nit--the demoralization of wealth and luxury; too great prosperity; the\r\nconcentration and the abuse of power. Shall we survive the lures with which\r\nthe spirit of evil, playing upon our self-love, seeks to trip our wayward\r\nfootsteps, purse-pride and party spirit, mistaken zeal and perverted\r\nreligion, fanaticism seeking to abridge liberty and liberty running to\r\nlicense, greed masquerading as a patriot and ambition making a commodity of\r\nglory--or under the process of a divine evolution shall we be able to mount\r\nand ride the waves which swallowed the tribes of Israel, which engulfed the\r\nphalanxes of Greece and the legions of Rome, and which still beat the sides\r\nand sweep the decks of Europe?\r\n\r\nThe one-party power we have escaped; the one-man power we have escaped. The\r\nstars in their courses fight for us; the virtue and intelligence of the\r\npeople are still watchful and alert. Truth is mightier than ever, and\r\njustice, mounting guard even in the Hall of Statues, walks everywhere the\r\nbattlements of freedom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twentieth\r\n\r\n    The Real Grover Cleveland--Two Clevelands Before and After Marriage--A\r\n    Correspondence and a Break of Personal Relations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were, as I have said, two Grover Clevelands--before and after\r\nmarriage--and, it might be added, between his defeat in 1888 and his\r\nelection in 1892. He was so sure of his election in 1888 that he could not\r\nbe induced to see the danger of the situation in his own State of New York,\r\nwhere David Bennett Hill, who had succeeded him in the governorship, was a\r\ncandidate for reelection, and whom he personally detested, had become the\r\nruling party force. He lost the State, and with it the election, while Hill\r\nwon, and thereby arose an ugly faction fight.\r\n\r\nI did not believe as the quadrennial period approached in 1892 that Mr.\r\nCleveland could be elected. I still think he owed his election, and\r\nHarrison his defeat, to the Homestead riots of the midsummer, which\r\ntransferred the labor vote bodily from the Republicans to the Democrats.\r\nMainly on account of this belief I opposed his nomination that year.\r\n\r\nIn the Kentucky State Convention I made my opposition resonant, if not\r\neffective. \"I understand,\" I said in an address to the assembled delegates,\r\n\"that you are all for Grover Cleveland?\"\r\n\r\nThere came an affirmative roar.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I continued, \"I am not, and if you send me to the National\r\nConvention I will not vote for his nomination, if his be the only name\r\npresented, because I firmly believe that his nomination will mean the\r\nmarching through a slaughter-house to an open grave, and I refuse to be\r\nparty to such a folly.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of the convention was my appointment by acclamation, but it was\r\nmany a day before I heard the last of my unlucky figure of speech.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this splendid indorsement, I went to the National\r\nConvention feeling very like the traditional \"poor boy at a frolic.\" All\r\nseemed to me lost save honor and conviction. I had become the embodiment\r\nof my own epigram, \"a tariff for revenue only.\" Mr. Cleveland, in the\r\nbeginning very much taken by it, had grown first lukewarm and then\r\nfrightened. His \"Free Trade\" message of 1887 had been regarded by the party\r\nas an answering voice. But I knew better.\r\n\r\nIn the national platform, over the protest of Whitney, his organizer, and\r\nVilas, his spokesman, I had forced him to stand on that gospel. He flew\r\ninto a rage and threatened to modify, if not to repudiate, the plank in his\r\nletter of acceptance. We were still on friendly terms and, upon reaching\r\nhome, I wrote him the following letter. It reads like ancient history,\r\nbut, as the quarrel which followed cut a certain figure in the political\r\nchronicle of the time, the correspondence may not be historically out of\r\ndate, or biographically uninteresting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WATTERSON TO MR. CLEVELAND\r\n\r\nCourier-Journal Office, Louisville, July 9, 1892.--My Dear Mr. President:\r\nI inclose you two editorial articles from the Courier-Journal, and, that\r\ntheir spirit and purpose may not be misunderstood by you, I wish to add a\r\nword or two of a kind directly and entirely personal.\r\n\r\nTo a man of your robust understanding and strong will, opposition and\r\ncriticism are apt to be taken as more or less unfriendly; and, as you are\r\nat present advised, I can hardly expect that any words of mine will be\r\nreceived by you with sentiments either of confidence or favor.\r\n\r\nI was admonished by a certain distrust, if not disdain, visited upon the\r\nhonest challenge I ventured to offer your Civil Service policy, when you\r\nwere actually in office, that you did not differ from some other great men\r\nI have known in an unwillingness, or at least an inability, to accept,\r\nwithout resentment, the question of your infallibility. Nevertheless, I was\r\nthen, as I am now, your friend, and not your enemy, animated by the\r\nsingle purpose to serve the country, through you, as, wanting your great\r\nopportunities, I could not serve it through myself.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years when you were President, I asked you but for one\r\nthing that lay near my heart. You granted that handsomely; and, if you\r\nhad given me all you had to give beside, you could not have laid me under\r\ngreater obligation. It is a gratification to me to know, and it ought to be\r\nsome warrant both of my intelligence and fidelity for you to remember that\r\nthat matter resulted in credit to the Administration and benefit to the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nBut to the point; I had at St. Louis in 1888 and at Chicago, the present\r\nyear, to oppose what was represented as your judgment and desire in the\r\nadoption of a tariff plank in our national platform; successfully in both\r\ncases. The inclosed articles set forth the reasons forcing upon me a\r\ndifferent conclusion from yours, in terms that may appear to you bluntly\r\nspecific, but I hope not personally offensive; certainly not by intention,\r\nfor, whilst I would not suppress the truth to please you or any man, I\r\nhave a decent regard for the sensibilities and the rights of all men,\r\nparticularly of men so eminent as to be beyond the reach of anything except\r\ninsolence and injustice. Assuredly in your case, I am incapable of even so\r\nmuch as the covert thought of either, entertaining for you absolute respect\r\nand regard. But, my dear Mr. President, I do not think that you appreciate\r\nthe overwhelming force of the revenue reform issue, which has made you its\r\nidol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Corner of \"Mansfield\"--Home of Henry Watterson]\r\n\r\nIf you will allow me to say so, in perfect frankness and without intending\r\nto be rude or unkind, the gentlemen immediately about you, gentlemen upon\r\nwhom you rely for material aid and energetic party management, are not, as\r\nto the Tariff, Democrats at all; and have little conception of the place in\r\nthe popular mind and heart held by the Revenue Reform idea, or, indeed of\r\nany idea, except that of organization and money.\r\n\r\nOf the need of these latter, no man has a more realizing sense, or larger\r\ninformation and experience, than I have. But they are merely the brakes and\r\nwheels of the engine, to which principles and inspirations are, and must\r\nalways be, the elements of life and motion. It is to entreat you therefore,\r\nin your coming letter and address, not to underestimate the tremendous\r\ndriving power of this Tariff issue, and to beg you, not even to seem to\r\nqualify it, or to abridge its terms in a mistaken attempt to seem to be\r\nconservative.\r\n\r\nYou cannot escape your great message of 1887 if you would. I know it by\r\nheart, and I think that I perfectly apprehend its scope and tenor. Take it\r\nas your guiding star. Stand upon it. Reiterate it. Emphasize it, amplify\r\nit, but do not subtract a thought, do not erase a word. For every vote\r\nwhich a bold front may lose you in the East you will gain two votes in the\r\nWest. In the East, particularly in New York, enemies lurk in your very\r\ncupboard, and strike at you from behind your chair at table. There is more\r\nthan a fighting chance for Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota, and next to\r\na certainty in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana, if you put yourself\r\npersonally at the head of the column which is moving in your name,\r\nsupposing it to be another name for reduced taxes and freer exchanges.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged as I was by the condition of things in New York and Indiana\r\nprior to the Chicago Convention, depressed and almost hopeless by your\r\nnomination, I can see daylight, if you will relax your grip somewhat upon\r\nthe East and throw yourself confidently upon the West.\r\n\r\nI write warmly because I feel warmly. If you again occupy the White House,\r\nand it is my most constant and earnest prayer that you may, be sure that\r\nyou will not be troubled by me. I cannot hope that my motives in opposing\r\nyour nomination, consistent as you know them to have been, or that my\r\nconduct during the post-convention discussion and canvass, free as I know\r\nit to have been of ill-feeling, or distemper, has escaped misrepresentation\r\nand misconception. I could not, without the loss of my self-respect,\r\napproach you on any private matter whatever; though it may not be amiss\r\nfor me to say to you, that three weeks before the meeting of the National\r\nConvention, I wrote to Mr. Gorman and Mr. Brice urging the withdrawal of\r\nany opposition, and declaring that I would be a party to no movement to\r\nwork the two-thirds rule to defeat the will of the majority.\r\n\r\nThis is all I have to say, Mr. President, and you can believe it or not, as\r\nyou please; though you ought to know that I would write you nothing except\r\nin sincere conviction, nor speak to you, or of you, except in a candid and\r\nkindly spirit. Trusting that this will find you hale, hearty, and happy, I\r\nam, dear sir, your fellow democrat and most faithful friend,\r\n\r\nHENRY WATTERSON.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CLEVELAND TO MR. WATTERSON\r\n\r\nBy return mail I received this answer:\r\n\r\nGray Gables, Buzzards Bay, Mass., July 15, 1892.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. WATTERSON:\r\n\r\nI have received your letter and the clippings you inclosed.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that I understand perfectly all that they mean. One thing\r\nthey demonstrate beyond any doubt, to-wit: that you have not--I think I may\r\nsay--the slightest conception of my disposition. It may be that I know\r\nas little about yours. I am surprised by the last paragraph of The\r\nCourier-Journal article of July 8 and amazed to read the statements\r\ncontained in your letter, that you know the message of 1887 by heart. It\r\nis a matter of very small importance, but I hope you will allow me to say,\r\nthat in all the platform smashing you ever did, you never injured nor\r\ninspired me that I have ever seen or heard of, except that of 1888. I\r\nexcept that, so I may be exactly correct when I write, \"seen or heard\r\nof,\"--for I use the words literally.\r\n\r\nI would like very much to present some views to you relating to the tariff\r\nposition, but I am afraid to do so.\r\n\r\nI will, however, venture to say this: If we are defeated this year, I\r\npredict a Democratic wandering in the dark wilds of discouragement for\r\ntwenty-five years. I do not purpose to be at all responsible for such a\r\nresult. I hope all others upon whom rests the least responsibility will\r\nfully appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThe world will move on when both of us are dead. While we stay, and\r\nespecially while we are in any way concerned in political affairs and while\r\nwe are members of the same political brotherhood, let us both resolve to be\r\njust and modest and amiable. Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\nHon. Henry Watterson, Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WATTERSON TO MR. CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI said in answer:\r\n\r\nLouisville, July 22, 1892.--My Dear Sir: I do not see how you could\r\nmisunderstand the spirit in which I wrote, or be offended by my plain\r\nwords. They were addressed as from one friend to another, as from one\r\nDemocrat to another. If you entertain the idea that this is a false view\r\nof our relative positions, and that your eminence lifts you above both\r\ncomradeship and counsels, I have nothing to say except to regret that, in\r\nunderestimating your breadth of character I exposed myself too contumely.\r\n\r\nYou do, indeed, ride a wave of fortune and favor. You are quite beyond\r\nthe reach of insult, real or fancied. You could well afford to be more\r\ntolerant.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the ignorance of my service to the Democratic party, which you\r\nare at such pains to indicate--and, particularly, with reference to the\r\nsectional issue and the issue of tariff reform--I might, if I wanted to be\r\nunamiable, suggest to you a more attentive perusal of the proceedings of\r\nthe three national conventions which nominated you for President.\r\n\r\nBut I purpose nothing of the sort. In the last five national conventions my\r\nefforts were decisive in framing the platform of the party. In each of them\r\nI closed the debate, moved the previous question and was sustained by the\r\nconvention. In all of them, except the last, I was a maker, not a smasher.\r\nTouching what happened at Chicago, the present year, I had a right, in\r\ncommon with good Democrats, to be anxious; and out of that sense of anxiety\r\nalone I wrote you. I am sorry that my temerity was deemed by you intrusive\r\nand, entering a respectful protest against a ban which I cannot believe to\r\nbe deserved by me, and assuring you that I shall not again trouble you in\r\nthat way, I am, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nHENRY WATTERSON.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ended my personal relations with Mr. Cleveland. Thereafter we did not\r\nspeak as we passed by. He was a hard man to get on with. Overcredulous,\r\nthough by no means excessive, in his likes, very tenacious in his dislikes,\r\nsuspicious withal, he grew during his second term in the White House,\r\nexceedingly \"high and mighty,\" suggesting somewhat the \"stuffed prophet,\"\r\nof Mr. Dana's relentless lambasting and verifying my insistence that he\r\nposed rather as an idol to be worshiped, than a leader to be trusted and\r\nloved. He was in truth a strong man, who, sufficiently mindful of his\r\nlimitations in the beginning, grew by unexampled and continued success\r\noverconfident and overconscious in his own conceit. He had a real desire to\r\nserve the country. But he was apt to think that he alone could effectively\r\nserve it. In one of our spats I remember saying to him, \"You seem, Mr.\r\nPresident, to think you are the only pebble on the beach--the one honest\r\nand brave man in the party--hut let me assure you of my own knowledge that\r\nthere are others.\" His answer was, \"Oh, you go to ----!\"\r\n\r\nHe split his party wide open. The ostensible cause was the money issue.\r\nBut, underlying this, there was a deal of personal embitterment. Had he\r\nbeen a man of foresight--or even of ordinary discernment--he might have\r\nheld it together and with it behind him have carried the gold standard.\r\n\r\nI had contended for a sound currency from the outset of the fiscal\r\ncontention, fighting first the green-back craze and then the free silver\r\ncraze against an overwhelming majority in the West and South, nowhere more\r\nradically relentless than in Kentucky. Both movements had their origin on\r\neconomic fallacies and found their backing in dishonest purpose to escape\r\nhonest indebtedness.\r\n\r\nThrough Mr. Cleveland the party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Tilden was\r\nconverted from a Democrat into a Populist, falling into the arms of Mr.\r\nBryan, whose domination proved as baleful in one way as Mr. Cleveland's had\r\nbeen in another, the final result shipwreck, with the extinguishment of all\r\nbut the label.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan was a young man of notable gifts of speech and boundless\r\nself-assertion. When he found himself well in the saddle he began to rule\r\ndespotically and to ride furiously. A party leader more short-sighted could\r\nhardly be imagined. None of his judgments came true. As a consequence the\r\nRepublicans for a long time had everything their own way, and, save for\r\nthe Taft-Roosevelt quarrel, might have held their power indefinitely. All\r\nhistory tells us that the personal equation must be reckoned with in\r\npublic life. Assuredly it cuts no mean figure in human affairs. And, when\r\npoliticians fall out--well--the other side comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-First\r\n\r\n    Stephen Foster, the Song-Writer--A Friend Comes to the Rescu\r\n    His Originality--\"My Old Kentucky Home\" and the \"Old Folks at\r\n    Home\"--General Sherman and \"Marching Through Georgia\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have received many letters touching what I said a little while ago of\r\nStephen Collins Foster, the song writer. In that matter I had, and could\r\nhave had, no unkindly thought or purpose. The story of the musical\r\nscrapbook rested not with me, but as I stated, upon the averment of Will S.\r\nHays, a rival song writer. But that the melody of Old Folks at Home may be\r\nfound in Schubert's posthumous Rosemonde admits not of contradiction for\r\nthere it is, and this would seem to be in some sort corroborative evidence\r\nof the truth of Hays' story.\r\n\r\nAmong these letters comes one from Young E. Allison which is entitled to\r\nserious consideration. Mr. Allison is a gentleman of the first order of\r\ncharacter and culture, an editor and a musician, and what he writes cannot\r\nfail to carry with it very great weight. I need make no apology for quoting\r\nhim at length.\r\n\r\n\"I have long been collecting material about Foster from his birth to his\r\ndeath,\" says Mr. Allison, \"and aside from his weak and fatal love of drink,\r\nwhich developed after he was twenty-five, and had married, his life was one\r\ncontinuous devotion to the study of music, of painting, of poetry and of\r\nlanguages; in point of fact, of all the arts that appeal to one who feels\r\nwithin him the stir of the creative. He was, quite singularly enough, a\r\nfine mathematician, which undoubtedly aided him in the study of music as a\r\nscience, to which time and balance play such an important part. In fact, I\r\nbelieve it was the mathematical devil in his brain that came to hold him\r\nwithin such bare and primitive forms of composition and so, to some extent,\r\nto delimit the wider development of his genius.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to Foster's drinking habits, however unfortunate they proved to him\r\nthey did not affect the quality of his art as he bequeathed it to us.\r\nNo one cares to recall the unhappy fortunes of Burns, De Musset, Chopin\r\nor--even in our own time--of O. Henry, and others who might be named. In\r\nnone of their productions does the hectic fever of over-stimulation show\r\nitself. No purer, gentler or simpler aspirations were ever expressed in the\r\nvarying forms of music and verse than flowed from Foster's pen, even as\r\npenetrating benevolence came from the pen of O. Henry, embittered and\r\nsolitary as his life had been. Indeed when we come to regard what the\r\ndrinkers of history have done for the world in spite of the artificial\r\nstimulus they craved, we may say with Lincoln as Lincoln said of Grant,\r\n'Send the other generals some of the same brand.'\r\n\r\n\"Foster was an aristocrat of aristocrats, both by birth and gifts. He\r\ninherited the blood of Richard Steele and of the Kemble family, noted in\r\nEnglish letters and dramatic annals. To these artistic strains he\r\nadded undoubtedly the musical temperament of an Italian grandmother or\r\ngreat-grand-mother. He was a cousin of John Rowan, the distinguished\r\nKentucky lawyer and senator. Of Foster's family, his father, his brothers,\r\nhis sisters were all notable as patriots, as pioneers in engineering, in\r\ncommerce and in society. One of his brothers designed and built the early\r\nPennsylvania Railroad system and died executive vice-president of that\r\ngreat corporation. Thus he was born to the arts and to social distinction.\r\nBut, like many men of the creative temperament, he was born a solitary,\r\ndestined to live in a land of dreams. The singular beauty and grace of his\r\nperson and countenance, the charm of his voice, manner and conversation,\r\nwere for the most part familiar to the limited circle of his immediate\r\nfamily and friends. To others he was reticent, with a certain hauteur of\r\ntimidity, avoiding society and public appearances to the day of his death.\r\n\r\n\"Now those are the facts about Foster. They certainly do not describe the\r\n'ne'er-do-well of a good family' who hung round barrooms, colored-minstrel\r\nhaunts and theater entrances. I can find only one incident to show that\r\nFoster ever went to hear his own songs sung in public. He was essentially a\r\nsolitary, who, while keenly observant of and entering sympathizingly into\r\nthe facts of life, held himself aloof from immediate contact with its\r\ncrowded stream. He was solitary from sensitivity, not from bitterness or\r\nindifference. He made a large fortune for his day with his songs and was a\r\npopular idol.\r\n\r\n\"Let us come now to the gravamen of my complaint. You charge on the\r\nauthority of mere gossip from the late Will S. Hays, that Foster did not\r\ncompose his own music, but that he had obtained a collection of unpublished\r\nmanuscripts by an unnamed old 'German musician and thus dishonestly,\r\nby pilfering and suppression' palmed off upon the public themes and\r\ncompositions which he could not himself have originated. Something like\r\nthis has been said about every composer and writer, big and little, whose\r\npersonality and habits did not impress his immediate neighbors as implying\r\nthe possession of genius. The world usually expects direct inheritance and\r\na theatric impressiveness of genius in its next-door neighbor before it\r\naccepts the proof of his works alone. For that reason Napoleon's paternity\r\nin Corsica was ascribed to General Maboeuf, and Henry Clay's in early\r\nKentucky to Patrick Henry. That legend of the 'poor, unknown German\r\nmusician' who composed in poverty and secrecy the deathless songs that\r\nhave obsessed the world of music lovers, has been told of numberless young\r\ncomposers on their way to fame, but died out in the blaze of their later\r\nwork. I have no doubt they told it of Foster, as they did also of Hays.\r\nAnd Colonel Hays doubtless repeated it to you as the intimate gossip about\r\nFoster.\r\n\r\n\"I have an article written by Colonel Hays and published in and cut from\r\nThe Courier-Journal some twelve years after the composer's death, in which\r\nhe sketches the life and work of Stephen Collins Foster. In that article he\r\nlays especial stress upon the surprising originality of the Foster themes\r\nand of their musical setting. He praises their distinct American or rather\r\nnative inspiration and flavor, and describes from his own knowledge of\r\nFoster how they were 'written from his heart.' No mention or suggestion in\r\nit of any German or other origin for any of those melodies that the world\r\nthen and now cherishes as American in costume, but universal in appeal.\r\nWhile you may have heard something in Schubert's compositions that\r\nsuggested something in Foster's most famous song, still I venture to say it\r\nwas only a suggestion, such as often arises from the works of composers of\r\nthe same general type. Schubert and Foster were both young sentimentalists\r\nand dreamers who must have had similar dreams that found expression in\r\ntheir similar progressions.\r\n\r\n\"The German musicians from whom Foster got inspiration to work were\r\nBeethoven, Glück, Weber, Mozart. He was a student of all of them and of the\r\nItalian school also, as some of his songs show. Foster's first and only\r\nmusic teacher--except in the 'do-re-mi' exercises in his schoolboy\r\nlife--testifies that Foster's musical apprehension was so quick, his\r\nintuitive grasp of its science so complete that after a short time there\r\nwas nothing he could teach him of the theory of composition; that his\r\npupil went straight to the masters and got illustration and discipline for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"This was to be expected of a precocious genius who had written a concerted\r\npiece for flutes at thirteen, who was trying his wings on love songs at\r\nsixteen, and before he was twenty-one had composed several of the most\r\nfamous of his American melodies, among them Oh Susannah, Old Dog Tray and\r\nOld Uncle Ned. As in other things he taught himself music, but he studied\r\nit ardently at the shrines of the masters. He became a master of the art of\r\nsong writing. If anybody cares to hunt up the piano scores that Verdi made\r\nof songs from his operas in the days of Foster he will find that the great\r\nItalian composer's settings were quite as thin as Foster's and exhibited\r\nnot much greater art. It was the fault of the times on the piano, not of\r\nthe composers. It was not till long afterward that the color capacities\r\nof the piano were developed. As Foster was no pianist, but rather a pure\r\nmelodist, he could not be expected to surpass his times in the management\r\nof the piano, the only 'orchestra' he had. It will not do to regard Foster\r\nas a crude musician. His own scores reveal him as the most artful of\r\n'artless' composers.\r\n\r\n\"It is not even presumption to speak of him in the same breath with Verdi.\r\nThe breadth and poignancy of Foster's melodies entitle them to the highest\r\ncritical respect, as they have received worldwide appreciation from great\r\nmusicians and plain music lovers. Wherever he has gone he has reached the\r\npopular heart. Here in the United States he has quickened the pulse beats\r\nof four generations. But this master creator of a country's only native\r\nsongs has invariably here at home been apologized for as a sort of\r\n'cornfield musician,' a mere banjo strummer, a hanger-on at barrooms where\r\nminstrel quartets rendered his songs and sent the hat round. The reflection\r\nwill react upon his country; it will not detract from the real Foster when\r\nthe constructive critic appears to write his brief and unfortunate life. I\r\nam not contending that he was a genius of the highest rank, although he had\r\nthe distinction that great genius nearly always achieves, of creating a\r\nschool that produced many imitators and established a place apart for\r\nitself in the world's estimation. In ballad writing he did for the United\r\nStates what Watteau did for painting in France. As Watteau found a Flemish\r\nschool in France and left a French school stamped forever, so Foster found\r\nthe United States a home for imitations of English, Irish, German and\r\nItalian songs, and left a native ballad form and melodic strain forever\r\nimpressed upon it as pure American.\r\n\r\n\"He was like Watteau in more than that. Watteau took the elegancies and\r\nfripperies of the corrupt French court and fixed them in art immortal, as\r\nif the moment had been arrested and held in actual motion. Foster took\r\nthe curious and melancholy spectacle of African slavery at its height,\r\nsuperimposed by the most elegant and picturesque social manners this\r\ncountry has known, at the moment the institution was at its zenith. He\r\nsaw the glamor, the humor, the tragedy, the contrasts, the emotional\r\ndepths--that lay unplumbed beneath it all. He fixed it there for all time,\r\nfor all hearts and minds everywhere. His songs are not only the pictorial\r\ncanvas of that time, they are the emotional history of the times. It was\r\ndone by a boy who was not prophet enough to foresee the end, or philosopher\r\nenough to demonstrate the conditions, but who was born with the intuition\r\nto feel it all and set it forth deeply and truly from every aspect.\r\n\r\n\"While Foster wrote many comic songs there is ever in them something of\r\nthe melancholy undercurrent that has been detected under the laces and\r\narabesques of Chopin's nominally frivolous dances. Foster's ballad form was\r\nextremely attenuated, but the melodic content filled it so completely that\r\nit seems to strain at the bounds and must be repeated and repeated to\r\nfurnish full gratification to the ear. His form when compared with\r\nthe modern ballad's amplitude seems like a Tanagra figurine beside a\r\nMichelangelo statue--but the figurine is as fine in its scope as the statue\r\nis in the greater.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will think Foster over and revise him 'upward.'\"\r\n\r\nAll of us need to be admonished to speak no evil of the dead. I am trying\r\nin Looking Backward to square the adjuration with the truth. Perhaps I\r\nshould speak only of that which is known directly to myself. It costs me\r\nnothing to accept this statement of Mr. Allison and to incorporate it as an\r\nessential part of the record as far as it relates to the most famous and in\r\nhis day the most beloved of American song writers.\r\n\r\nOnce at a Grand Army encampment General Sherman and I were seated together\r\non the platform when the band began to play Marching Through Georgia, when\r\nthe general said rather impatiently: \"I wish I had a dollar for every time\r\nI have had to listen to that blasted tune.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I answered: \"Well, there is another tune about which I might say the\r\nsame thing,\" meaning My Old Kentucky Home.\r\n\r\nNeither of us was quite sincere. Both were unconsciously pleased to hear\r\nthe familiar strains. At an open-air fiesta in Barcelona some American\r\nfriends who made their home there put the bandmaster up to breaking forth\r\nwith the dear old melody as I came down the aisle, and I was mightily\r\npleased. Again at a concert in Lucerne, the band, playing a potpourri of\r\nSwiss songs, interpolated Kentucky's national anthem and the group of us\r\nstood up and sang the chorus.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder that men march joyously to battle and death to drum and\r\nfife squeaking and rattling The Girl I Left Behind Me. It may be a long\r\nway to Tipperary, but it is longer to the end of the tether that binds the\r\nheart of man to the cradle songs of his nativity. With the cradle songs of\r\nAmerica the name of Stephen Collins Foster \"is immortal bound,\" and I would\r\nno more dishonor his memory than that of Robert Burns or the author of The\r\nStar-Spangled Banner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Second\r\n\r\n    Theodore Roosevelt--His Problematic Character--He Offers Me an\r\n    Appointment--His _Bonhomie_ and Chivalry--Proud of His Rebel Kin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy nor yet a wholly congenial task to write--truthfully,\r\nintelligently and frankly to write--about Theodore Roosevelt. He belonged\r\nto the category of problematical characters. A born aristocrat, he at no\r\ntime took the trouble to pose as a special friend of the people; a born\r\nleader, he led with a rough unsparing hand. He was the soul of controversy.\r\nTo one who knew him from his childhood as I did, always loving him and\r\nrarely agreeing with him, it was plain to see how his most obvious faults\r\ncommended him to the multitude and made for a popularity that never quite\r\ndeserted him.\r\n\r\nAs poorly as I rate the reign of majorities I prefer it to the one-man\r\npower, either elective or dynastic. The scheme of a third term in the\r\npresidency for General Grant seemed to me a conspiracy though with many of\r\nits leaders I was on terms of affectionate intimacy. I fought and helped\r\nto kill in 1896 the unborn scheme to give Mr. Cleveland a third term.\r\nInevitably as the movement for the retention of Theodore Roosevelt beyond\r\nthe time already fixed began to show itself in 1907, my pen was primed\r\nagainst it and I wrote variously and voluminously.\r\n\r\nThere appeared in one of the periodicals for January, 1908, a sketch of\r\nmine which but for a statement issued concurrently from the White House\r\nwould have attracted more attention than it did. In this I related how at\r\nWashington just before the War of Sections I had a musical pal--the niece\r\nof a Southern senator--who had studied in Paris, been a protégée of the\r\nEmpress Eugénie and become an out-and-out imperialist. Louis Napoleon was\r\nher ideal statesman. She not only hated the North but accepted as gospel\r\ntruth all the misleading theories of the South: that cotton was king; that\r\nslavery was a divine institution; that in any enterprise one Southern man\r\nwas a match for six Northern men.\r\n\r\nOn these points we had many contentions. When the break came she went\r\nSouth with her family. The last I saw of her was crossing Long Bridge in a\r\nlumbering family carriage waving a tiny Confederate flag.\r\n\r\nForty-five years intervened. I had heard of her from time to time wandering\r\naimlessly over Europe, but had not met her until the preceding winter in a\r\nfamous Southern homestead. There she led me into a rose garden, and seated\r\nbeneath its clustered greeneries she said with an air of triumph, \"Now you\r\nsee, my dear old friend, that I was right and you were wrong all the time.\"\r\n\r\nStartled, and altogether forgetful, I asked in what way.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she answered, \"at last the South is coming to its own.\"\r\n\r\nStill out of rapport with her thought I said something about the\r\nobliteration of sectionalism and the arrival of political freedom and\r\ngeneral prosperity. She would none of this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry Watterson (Photograph taken in Florida)]\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" she abruptly interposed, \"that the son of Martha Bullock has come\r\nto his own and he will rescue us from the mudsills of the North.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if our former discussions had been but yesterday. Then I gave\r\nher the right of way, interjecting a query now and then to give emphasis to\r\nher theme, while she unfolded the plan which seemed to her so simple and\r\neasy; God's own will; the national destiny, first a third term, and then\r\nlife tenure à la Louis Napoleone for Theodore Roosevelt, the son of Martha\r\nBullock, the nephew of our great admiral, who was to redress all the wrongs\r\nof the South and bring the Yankees to their just deserts at last.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" I ended my sketch, \"out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, why not\r\nout of the brain of this crazed old woman of the South?\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the following April I came from my winter home in Florida to the\r\nnational capital, and the next day was called by the President to the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing I want to ask,\" said he, \"is whether that old woman was a\r\nreal person or a figment of your imagination?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a figment of my imagination,\" I answered, \"but you put her out of\r\nbusiness with a single punch. Why didn't you hold back your statement a\r\nbit? If you had done so there was room for lots of sport ahead.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in no mood for joking. \"Henry Watterson,\" he said, \"I want to talk\r\nto you seriously about this third-term business. I will not deny that I\r\nhave thought of the thing--thought of it a great deal.\" Then he proceeded\r\nto relate from his point of view the state of the country and the immediate\r\nsituation. He spoke without reserve of his relations to the nearest\r\nassociated public men, of what were and what were not his personal and\r\nparty obligations, his attitude toward the political questions of the\r\nmoment, and ended by saying, \"What do you make of all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President,\" I replied, \"you know that I am your friend, and as your\r\nfriend I tell you that if you go out of here the fourth of next March\r\nplacing your friend Taft in your place you will make a good third to\r\nWashington and Lincoln; but if you allow these wild fellows willy-nilly\r\nto induce you, in spite of your declaration, to accept the nomination,\r\nsubstantially for a third term, all issues will be merged in that issue,\r\nand in my judgment you will not carry a state in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nAs if much impressed and with a show of feeling he said: \"It may be so. At\r\nany rate I will not do it. If the convention nominates me I will promptly\r\nsend my declination. If it nominates me and adjourns I will call it\r\ntogether again and it will have to name somebody else.\"\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the implacability which pursued him I may mention\r\nthat among many leading Republicans to whom I related the incident most\r\nof them discredited his sincerity, one of them--a man of national\r\nimportance--expressing the opinion that all along he was artfully playing\r\nfor the nomination. This I do not believe. Perhaps he was never quite fixed\r\nin his mind. The presidency is a wondrous lure. Once out of the White\r\nHouse--what else and what----?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his return from one of his several foreign journeys a party of some\r\nhundred or more of his immediate personal friends gave him a private dinner\r\nat a famous uptown restaurant. I was placed next him at table. It goes\r\nwithout saying that we had all sorts of a good time--he Cæsar and I\r\nBrutus--the prevailing joke the entente between the two.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he began his very happy speech, \"that I am the bravest man\r\nthat ever lived, for here I have been sitting three hours by the side of\r\nBrutus--have repeatedly seen him clutch his knife--without the blink of an\r\neye or the turn of a feature.\"\r\n\r\nTo which in response when my turn came I said: \"You gentlemen seem to be\r\nsurprised that there should be so perfect an understanding between our\r\nguest and myself. But there is nothing new or strange in that. It goes\r\nback, indeed, to his cradle and has never been disturbed throughout the\r\nintervening years of political discussion--sometimes acrimonious. At the\r\ntop of the acclivity of his amazing career--in the very plenitude of his\r\neminence and power--let me tell you that he offered me one of the most\r\nhonorable and distinguished appointments within his gift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them about that, Marse Henry,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"With your permission, Mr. President, I will,\" I said, and continued: \"The\r\ncentenary of the West Point Military Academy was approaching. I was at\r\ndinner with my family at a hotel in Washington when General Corbin joined\r\nus. 'Will you,' he abruptly interjected, 'accept the chairmanship of the\r\nboard of visitors to the academy this coming June?'\r\n\r\n\"'What do you want of me?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'It is the academy's centenary, which we propose to celebrate, and we want\r\nan orator.'\r\n\r\n\"'General Corbin,' said I, 'you are coming at me in a most enticing way.\r\nI know all about West Point. Here at Washington I grew up with it. I have\r\nbeen fighting legislative battles for the Army all my life. That you\r\nYankees should come to a ragged old rebel like me for such a service is a\r\ndistinction indeed, and I feel immensely honored. But which page of the\r\ncourt calendar made you a plural? Whom do you mean by \"we\"?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why,' he replied in serio-comic vein, 'the President, the Secretary of\r\nWar and Me, myself.'\r\n\r\n\"I promised him to think it over and give him an answer. Next day I\r\nreceived a letter from the President, making the formal official tender and\r\nexpressing the hope that I would not decline it. Yet how could I accept it\r\nwith the work ahead of me? It was certain that if I became a part of the\r\npresidential junket and passed a week in the delightful company promised\r\nme, I would be unfit for the loyal duty I owed my belongings and my party,\r\nand so reluctantly--more reluctantly than I can tell you--I declined,\r\nobliging them to send for Gen. Horace Porter and bring him over from across\r\nthe ocean, where he was ably serving as Ambassador to France. I need\r\nnot add how well that gifted and versatile gentleman discharged the\r\ndistinguished and pleasing duty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last time I met Theodore Roosevelt was but a little while before his\r\ndeath. A small party of us, Editor Moore, of Pittsburgh, and Mr. Riggs,\r\nof the New York Central, at his invitation had a jolly midday breakfast,\r\nextending far into the afternoon. I never knew him happier or heartier.\r\nHis jocund spirit rarely failed him. He enjoyed life and wasted no time on\r\ntrivial worries, hit-or-miss, the keynote to his thought.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch blood of Holland and the cavalier blood of England mingled in\r\nhis veins in fair proportion. He was especially proud of the uncle, his\r\nmother's brother, the Southern admiral, head of the Confederate naval\r\norganization in Europe, who had fitted out the rebel cruisers and sent them\r\nto sea. And well he might be, for a nobler American never lived. At the\r\nclose of the War of Sections Admiral Bullock had in his possession some\r\nhalf million dollars of Confederate money. Instead of appropriating this to\r\nhis own use, as without remark or hindrance he might have done, he turned\r\nit over to the Government of the United States, and died a poor man.\r\n\r\nThe inconsistencies and quarrels in which Theodore Roosevelt was now and\r\nagain involved were largely temperamental. His mind was of that order which\r\nis prone to believe what it wants to believe. He did not take much time to\r\nthink. He leaped at conclusions, and from his premise his conclusion was\r\nusually sound. His tastes were domestic, his pastime, when not at his\r\nbooks, field sports.\r\n\r\nHe was not what might be called convivial, though fond of good\r\ncompany--very little wine affecting him--so that a certain self-control\r\nbecame second nature to him.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, he had no conscientious or doctrinal scruples about a third\r\nterm. He had found the White House a congenial abode, had accepted the\r\nliteral theory that his election in 1908 would not imply a third but a\r\nsecond term, and he wanted to remain. In point of fact I have an impression\r\nthat, barring Jackson and Polk, most of those who have got there were loath\r\nto give it up. We know that Grant was, and I am sure that Cleveland was. We\r\nowe a great debt to Washington, because if a third why not a fourth term?\r\nAnd then life tenure after the manner of the Caesars and Cromwells of\r\nhistory, and especially the Latin-Americans--Bolivar, Rosas and Diaz?\r\n\r\nAway back in 1873, after a dinner, Mr. Blaine took me into his den and told\r\nme that it was no longer a surmise but a fact that the group about General\r\nGrant, who had just been reflected by an overwhelming majority, was\r\nmaneuvering for a third term. To me this was startling, incredible.\r\nReturning to my hotel I saw a light still burning in the room of Senator\r\nMorton, of Indiana, and rapping at the door I was bidden to enter.\r\nWithout mentioning how it had reached me, I put the proposition to him.\r\n\"Certainly,\" he said, \"it is true.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, in a letter to the Courier-Journal, I reduced what I had\r\nheard to writing. Reading this over it seemed so sensational that I added a\r\nclosing paragraph, meant to qualify what I had written and to imply that I\r\nhad not gone quite daft.\r\n\r\n\"These things,\" I wrote, \"may sound queer to the ear of the country. They\r\nmay have visited me in my dreams; they may, indeed, have come to me betwixt\r\nthe sherry and the champagne, but nevertheless I do aver that they are\r\nbuzzing about here in the minds of many very serious and not unimportant\r\npersons.\"\r\n\r\nNever was a well-intentioned scribe so berated and ridiculed as I, never a\r\nsimple news gatherer so discredited. Democratic and Republican newspapers\r\nvied with one another which could say crossest things and laugh loudest.\r\nOne sentence especially caught the newspaper risibilities of the time, and\r\nit was many a year before the phrase \"between the sherry and the champagne\"\r\nceased to pursue me. That any patriotic American, twice elevated to the\r\npresidency, could want a third term, could have the hardihood to seek one\r\nwas inconceivable. My letter was an insult to General Grant and proof of my\r\nown lack of intelligence and restraint. They lammed me, laughed at me, good\r\nand strong. On each successive occasion of recurrence I have encountered\r\nthe same criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Third\r\n\r\n    The Actor and the Journalist--The Newspaper and the State--Joseph\r\n    Jefferson--His Personal and Artistic Career--Modest Character and\r\n    Religious Belief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journalist and the player have some things in common. Each turns night\r\ninto day. I have known rather intimately all the eminent English-speaking\r\nactors of my time from Henry Irving and Charles Wyndham to Edwin Booth and\r\nJoseph Jefferson, from Charlotte Cushman to Helena Modjeska. No people are\r\nquite so interesting as stage people.\r\n\r\nDuring nearly fifty years my life and the life of Joseph Jefferson ran\r\nclose upon parallel lines. He was eleven years my senior; but after\r\nthe desultory acquaintance of a man and a boy we came together under\r\ncircumstances which obliterated the disparity of age and established\r\nbetween us a lasting bond of affection. His wife, Margaret, had died, and\r\nhe was passing through Washington with the little brood of children she had\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nIt made the saddest spectacle I had ever seen. As I recall it after more\r\nthan sixty years, the scene of silent grief, of unutterable helplessness,\r\nhas still a haunting power over me, the oldest lad not eight years of age,\r\nthe youngest a girl baby in arms, the young father aghast before the sudden\r\ntragedy which had come upon him. There must have been something in my\r\nsympathy which drew him toward me, for on his return a few months later\r\nhe sought me out and we fell into the easy intercourse of established\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nI was recovering from an illness, and every day he would come and read by\r\nmy bedside. I had not then lost the action of one of my hands, putting an\r\nend to a course of musical study I had hoped to develop into a career. He\r\nwas infinitely fond of music and sufficiently familiar with the old masters\r\nto understand and enjoy them. He was an artist through and through,\r\npossessing a sweet nor yet an uncultivated voice--a blend between a low\r\ntenor and a high baritone--I was almost about to write a \"contralto,\" it\r\nwas so soft and liquid. Its tones in speech retained to the last their\r\ncharm. Who that heard them shall ever forget them?\r\n\r\nEarly in 1861 my friend Jefferson came to me and said: \"There is going to\r\nbe a war of the sections. I am not a warrior. I am neither a Northerner\r\nnor a Southerner. I cannot bring myself to engage in bloodshed, or to take\r\nsides. I have near and dear ones North and South. I am going away and I\r\nshall stay away until the storm blows over. It may seem to you unpatriotic,\r\nand it is, I know, unheroic. I am not a hero; I am, I hope, an artist. My\r\nworld is the world of art, and I must be true to that; it is my patriotism,\r\nmy religion. I can do no manner of good here, and I am going away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that moment statesmen were hopefully estimating the chances of a\r\npeaceful adjustment and solution of the sectional controversy. With the\r\nprophet instinct of the artist he knew better. Though at no time taking an\r\nactive interest in politics or giving expression to party bias of any kind,\r\nhis personal associations led him into a familiar knowledge of the trend of\r\npolitical opinion and the portent of public affairs, and I can truly say\r\nthat during the fifty years that passed thereafter I never discussed any\r\ntopic of current interest or moment with him that he did not throw upon\r\nit the side lights of a luminous understanding, and at the same time an\r\nimpartial and intelligent judgment.\r\n\r\nHis mind was both reflective and radiating. His humor though perennial was\r\nsubdued; his wit keen and spontaneous, never acrid or wounding. His speech\r\nabounded with unconscious epigram. He had his beliefs and stood by them;\r\nbut he was never aggressive. Cleaner speech never fell from the lips of\r\nman. I never heard him use a profanity. We once agreed between ourselves to\r\ndraw a line across the salacious stories so much in vogue during our day;\r\nthe wit must exceed the dirt; where the dirt exceeded the wit we would none\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nHe was a singularly self-respecting man; genuinely a modest man. The\r\nactor is supposed to be so familiar with the pubic as to be proof against\r\nsurprises. Before his audience he must be master of himself, holding the\r\nsituation and his art by the firmest grip. He must simulate, not experience\r\nemotion, the effect referable to the seeming, never to the actuality\r\ninvolving the realization.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson held to this doctrine and applied it rigorously. On a certain\r\noccasion he was playing Caleb Plummer. In the scene between the old\r\ntoy-maker and his blind daughter, when the father discovers the dreadful\r\nresult of his dissimulation--an awkward hitch; and, the climax quite\r\nthwarted, the curtain came down. I was standing at the wings.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see that?\" he said as he brushed by me, going to his\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said I, following him. \"What was it?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned, his eyes still wet and his voice choked. \"I broke down,\" said\r\nhe; \"completely broke down. I turned away from the audience to recover\r\nmyself. But I failed and had the curtain rung.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene had been spoiled because the actor had been overcome by a sudden\r\nflood of real feeling, whereas he was to render by his art the feeling of\r\na fictitious character and so to communicate this to his audience. Caleb's\r\ncue was tears, but not Jefferson's.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I saw his self-possession tried in a different way. We\r\nwere dining with a gentleman who had overpartaken of his own hospitality.\r\nMr. Murat Halstead was of the company. There was also a German of\r\ndistinction, whose knowledge of English was limited. The Rip Van Winkle\r\ncraze was at its height. After sufficiently impressing the German with the\r\nrare opportunity he was having in meeting a man so famous as Mr. Jefferson,\r\nour host, encouraged by Mr. Halstead, and I am afraid not discouraged by\r\nme, began to urge Mr. Jefferson to give us, as he said, \"a touch of his\r\nmettle,\" and failing to draw the great comedian out he undertook himself to\r\ngive a few descriptive passages from the drama which was carrying the\r\ntown by storm. Poor Jefferson! He sat like an awkward boy, helpless and\r\nblushing, the German wholly unconscious of the fun or even comprehending\r\njust what was happening--Halstead and I maliciously, mercilessly enjoying\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI never heard Mr. Jefferson make a recitation or, except in the singing of\r\na song before his voice began to break, make himself a part of any private\r\nentertainment other than that of a spectator and guest.\r\n\r\nHe shrank from personal displays of every sort. Even in his younger days he\r\nrarely \"gagged,\" or interpolated, upon the stage. Yet he did not lack for\r\na ready wit. One time during the final act of Rip Van Winkle, a young\r\ncountryman in the gallery was so carried away that he quite lost his\r\nbearings and seemed to be about to climb over the outer railing. The\r\naudience, spellbound by the actor, nevertheless saw the rustic, and its\r\nattention was being divided between the two when Jefferson reached that\r\npoint in the action of the piece where Rip is amazed by the docility of his\r\nwife under the ill usage of her second husband. He took in the situation at\r\na glance.\r\n\r\nCasting his eye directly upon the youth in the gallery, he uttered the\r\nlines as if addressing them directly to him, \"Well, I would never have\r\nbelieved it if I had not seen it.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow, startled, drew back from his perilous position, and the\r\naudience broke into a storm of applause.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jefferson was a Swedenborgian in his religious belief. At one\r\ntime too extreme a belief in spiritualism threatened to cloud his sound,\r\nwholesome understanding. As he grew older and happier and passed out\r\nfrom the shadow of his early tragedy he fell away from the more sinister\r\ninfluence the supernatural had attained over his imagination. One time in\r\nWashington I had him to breakfast to meet the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice\r\nMatthews and Mr. Carlisle, the newly-elected Speaker of the House. It was a\r\nrainy Sunday, and it was in my mind to warn him that our company was made\r\nup of hard-headed lawyers not apt to be impressed by fairy tales and\r\nghost stories, and to suggest that he cut the spiritualism in case the\r\nconversation fell, as was likely, into the speculative. I forgot, or\r\nsomething hindered, and, sure enough, the question of second sight and mind\r\nreading came up, and I said to myself: \"Lord, now we'll have it.\" But it\r\nwas my kinsman, Stanley Matthews, who led off with a clairvoyant experience\r\nin his law practice. I began to be reassured. Mr. Carlisle followed with a\r\nmost mathematical account of some hobgoblins he had encountered in his\r\nlaw practice. Finally the Chief Justice, Mr. Waite, related a series of\r\nincidents so fantastic and incredible, yet detailed with the precision and\r\nlucidity of a master of plain statement, as fairly to stagger the most\r\nbelieving ghostseer. Then I said to myself again: \"Let her go, Joe, no\r\nmatter what you tell now you will fall below the standard set by these\r\nprofessional perfecters of pure reason, and are safe to do your best, or\r\nyour worst.\" I think he held his own, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Jefferson came to his artistic spurs slowly but surely, being nearly\r\nthirty years of age when he got his chance, and therefore wholly equal to\r\nit and prepared for it.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Burton stood and had stood for twenty-five years the recognized,\r\nthe reigning king of comedy in America. He was a master of his craft as\r\nwell as a leader in society and letters. To look at him when he came\r\nupon the stage was to laugh; yet he commanded tears almost as readily as\r\nlaughter. In New York City particularly he ruled the roost, and could and\r\ndid do that which had cost another his place. He began to take too many\r\nliberties with the public favor and, truth to say, was beginning to be both\r\ncoarse and careless. People were growing restive under ministrations which\r\nwere at times little less than impositions upon their forbearance. They\r\nwanted something if possible as strong, but more refined, and in the person\r\nof the leading comedy man of Laura Keene's company, a young actor by the\r\nname of Jefferson, they got it.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Sothern and Mr. Jefferson have told the story of Tom Taylor's\r\nextravaganza, \"Our American Cousin,\" in which the one as Dundreary, the\r\nother as Asa Trenchard, rose to almost instant popularity and fame. I shall\r\nnot repeat it except to say that Jefferson's Asa Trenchard was unlike any\r\nother the English or American stage has known. He played the raw Yankee\r\nboy, not in low comedy at all, but made him innocent and ignorant as a\r\nwell-born Green Mountain lad might be, never a bumpkin; and in the scene\r\nwhen Asa tells his sweetheart the bear story and whilst pretending to light\r\nhis cigar burns the will, he left not a dry eye in the house.\r\n\r\nNew York had never witnessed, never divined anything in pathos and humor\r\nso exquisite. Burton and his friends struggled for a season, but Jefferson\r\ncompletely knocked them out. Even had Burton lived, and had there been no\r\ndiverting war of sections to drown all else, Jefferson would have come to\r\nhis growth and taken his place as the first serio-comic actor of his time.\r\n\r\nRip Van Winkle was an evolution. Jefferson's half-brother, Charles Burke,\r\nhad put together a sketchy melodrama in two acts and had played in it, was\r\nplaying in it when he died. After his Trenchard, Jefferson turned himself\r\nloose in all sorts of parts, from Diggory to Mazeppa, a famous burlesque,\r\nwhich he did to a turn, imitating the mock heroics of the feminine horse\r\nmarines, so popular in the equestrian drama of the period, Adah Isaacs\r\nMenken, the beautiful and ill-fated, at their head. Then he produced\r\na version of Nicholas Nickleby, in which his Newman Noggs took a more\r\nambitious flight. These, however, were but the avant-couriers of the\r\nimmortal Rip.\r\n\r\nCharles Burke's piece held close to the lines of Irving's legend. When the\r\nvagabond returns from the mountains after the twenty years' sleep Gretchen\r\nis dead. The apex is reached when the old man, sitting dazed at a table in\r\nfront of the tavern in the village of Falling Water, asks after Derrick Van\r\nBeekman and Nick Vedder and other of his cronies. At last, half twinkle of\r\nhumor and half glimmer of dread, he gets himself to the point of asking\r\nafter Dame Van Winkle, and is told that she has been dead these ten years.\r\nThen like a flash came that wonderful Jeffersonian change of facial\r\nexpression, and as the white head drops upon the arms stretched before him\r\non the table he says: \"Well, she led me a hard life, a hard life, but she\r\nwas the wife of my bosom, she was _meine frau!_\"\r\n\r\nI did not see the revised, or rather the newly-created and written, Rip\r\nVan Winkle until Mr. Jefferson brought it to America and was playing it at\r\nNiblo's Garden in New York. Between himself and Dion Boucicault a drama\r\ncarrying all the possibilities, all the lights and shadows of his genius\r\nhad been constructed. In the first act he sang a drinking song to a wing\r\naccompaniment delightfully, adding much to the tone and color of the\r\nsituation. The exact reversal of the Lear suggestion in the last act was an\r\ninspiration, his own and not Boucicault's. The weird scene in the mountains\r\nfell in admirably with a certain weird note in the Jefferson genius, and\r\nsupplied the needed element of variety.\r\n\r\nI always thought it a good acting play under any circumstances, but, in\r\nhis hands, matchless. He thought himself that the piece, as a piece, and\r\nregardless of his own acting, deserved better of the critics than they were\r\nalways willing to give it. Assuredly, no drama that ever was written, as he\r\nplayed it, ever took such a hold upon the public. He rendered it to three\r\ngenerations, and to a rising, not a falling, popularity, drawing to the\r\nvery last undiminished audiences.\r\n\r\nBecause of this unexampled run he was sometimes described by unthinking\r\npeople as a one-part actor. Nothing could be farther from the truth. He\r\npossessed uncommon versatility. That after twenty years of the new Rip Van\r\nWinkle, when he was past fifty years of age, he could come back to such\r\nparts as Caleb Plummer and Acres is proof of this. He need not have done so\r\nat all. Carrying a pension roll of dependents aggregating fifteen or twenty\r\nthousand a year for more than a quarter of a century, Rip would still have\r\nsufficed his requirements. It was his love for his art that took him to The\r\nCricket and The Rivals, and at no inconsiderable cost to himself.\r\n\r\nI have heard ill-natured persons, some of them envious actors, say that he\r\ndid nothing for the stage.\r\n\r\nHe certainly did not make many contributions to its upholstery. He was in\r\nno position to emulate Sir Henry Irving in forcing and directing the public\r\ntaste. But he did in America quite as much as Sir Charles Wyndham and\r\nSir Henry Irving in England to elevate the personality, the social and\r\nintellectual standing of the actor and the stage, effecting in a lifetime a\r\nrevolution in the attitude of the people and the clergy of both countries\r\nto the theater and all things in it. This was surely enough for one man in\r\nany craft or country.\r\n\r\nHe was always a good stage speaker. Late in life he began to speak\r\nelsewhere, and finally to lecture. His success pleased him immensely. The\r\nnight of the Sunday afternoon charity for the Newsboys' Home in Louisville,\r\nwhen the promise of a talk from him had filled the house to overflowing,\r\nhe was like a boy who had come off from a college occasion with all the\r\nhonors. Indeed, the degrees of Harvard and Yale, which had reached him both\r\nunexpectedly and unsolicited, gave him a pleasure quite apart from the\r\nvanity they might have gratified in another; he regarded them, and justly,\r\nas the recognition at once of his profession and of his personal character.\r\n\r\nI never knew a man whose moral sensibilities were more acute. He loved the\r\nrespectable. He detested the unclean. He was just as attractive off the\r\nstage as upon it, because he was as unaffected and real in his personality\r\nas he was sincere and conscientious in his public representations, his\r\nlovely nature showing through his art in spite of him. His purpose was to\r\nfill the scene and forget himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English newspapers accompanied the tidings of Mr. Jefferson's death\r\nwith rather sparing estimates of his eminence and his genius, though his\r\nsuccess in London, where he was well known, had been unequivocal. Indeed,\r\nhimself, alone with Edwin Booth and Mary Anderson, may be said to complete\r\nthe list of those Americans who have attained any real recognition in the\r\nBritish metropolis. The Times spoke of him as \"an able if not a great\r\nactor.\" If Joseph Jefferson was not a great actor I should like some\r\ncompetent person to tell me what actor of our time could be so described.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the journals of Paris referred to him as \"the American\r\nCoquelin.\" It had been apter to describe Coquelin as the French Jefferson.\r\nI never saw Frederic Lemaître. But, him apart, I have seen all the\r\neccentric comedians, the character actors of the last fifty years, and, in\r\nspell power, in precision and deftness of touch, in acute, penetrating,\r\nall-embracing and all-embodying intelligence and grasp, I should place\r\nJoseph Jefferson easily at their head.\r\n\r\nShakespeare was his Bible. The stage had been his cradle. He continued all\r\nhis days a student. In him met the meditative and the observing faculties.\r\nIn his love of fishing, his love of painting, his love of music we see the\r\nbrooding, contemplative spirit joined to the alert in mental force and\r\nforesight when he addressed himself to the activities and the objectives\r\nof the theater. He was a thorough stage manager, skillful, patient and\r\nupright. His company was his family. He was not gentler with the children\r\nand grandchildren he ultimately drew about him than he had been with the\r\nyoung men and young women who had preceded them in his employment and\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nHe was nowise ashamed of his calling. On the contrary, he was proud of it.\r\nHis mother had lived and died an actress. He preferred that his progeny\r\nshould follow in the footsteps of their forebears even as he had done.\r\nIt is beside the purpose to inquire, as was often done, what might have\r\nhappened had he undertaken the highest flights of tragedy; one might as\r\nwell discuss the relation of a Dickens to a Shakespeare. Sir Henry\r\nIrving and Sir Charles Wyndham in England, M. Coquelin in France, his\r\ncontemporaries--each had his _métier_. They were perfect in their art\r\nand unalike in their art. No comparison between them can be justly drawn.\r\nI was witness to the rise of all three of them, and have followed them\r\nin their greatest parts throughout their most brilliant and eminent and\r\nsuccessful careers, and can say of each as of Mr. Jefferson:\r\n\r\n  _More than King can no man be--Whether he\r\n  rule in Cyprus or in Dreams._\r\n\r\nThere shall be Kings of Thule after kings are gone. The actor dies and\r\nleaves no copy; his deeds are writ in water, only his name survives upon\r\ntradition's tongue, and yet, from Betterton and Garrick to Irving, from\r\nMacklin and Quin to Wyndham and Jefferson, how few!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Fourth\r\n\r\n    The Writing of Memoirs--Some Characteristics of Carl Shurz--Sam\r\n    Bowles--Horace White and the Mugwumps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nTalleyrand was so impressed by the world-compelling character of the\r\nmemoirs he had prepared for posterity that he fixed an interdict of more\r\nthan fifty years upon the date set for their publication, and when at\r\nlast the bulky tomes made their appearance, they excited no especial\r\ninterest--certainly created no sensation--and lie for the most part dusty\r\nupon the shelves of the libraries that contain them. For a different\r\nreason, Henry Ward Beecher put a time limit upon the volume, or volumes,\r\nwhich will tell us, among other things, all about one of the greatest\r\nscandals of modern times; and yet how few people now recall it or care\r\nanything about the dramatis personæ and the actual facts! Metternich, next\r\nafter Napoleon and Talleyrand, was an important figure in a stirring epoch.\r\nHe, too, indicted an autobiography, which is equally neglected among the\r\nbooks that are sometimes quoted and extolled, but rarely read. Rousseau,\r\nthe half insane, and Barras, the wholly vicious, have twenty readers where\r\nTalleyrand and Metternich have one.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, the writing of memoirs, excepting those of the\r\ntrivial French School or gossiping letters and diaries of the Pepys-Walpole\r\nvariety, would seem an unprofitable task for a great man's undertaking.\r\nBoswell certainly did for Johnson what the thunderous old doctor could not\r\nhave done for himself. Nevertheless, from the days of Cæsar to the days\r\nof Sherman and Lee, the captains of military and senatorial and literary\r\nindustry have regaled themselves, if they have not edified the public, by\r\nthe narration of their own stories; and, I dare say, to the end of time,\r\ninterest in one's self, and the mortal desire to linger yet a little longer\r\non the scene--now and again, as in the case of General Grant, the assurance\r\nof honorable remuneration making needful provision for others--will move\r\nthose who have cut some figure in the world to follow the wandering Celt in\r\nthe wistful hope--\r\n\r\n  _Around my fire an evening group to draw,\r\n  And tell of all I felt and all I saw._\r\n\r\nSomething like this occurs to me upon a reperusal of the unfinished memoirs\r\nof my old and dear friend, Carl Schurz. Assuredly few men had better\r\nwarrant for writing about themselves or a livelier tale to tell than the\r\nfamous German-American, who died leaving that tale unfinished. No man in\r\nlife was more misunderstood and maligned. There was nothing either erratic\r\nor conceited about Schurz, nor was he more pragmatic than is common to\r\nthe possessor of positive opinions along with the power to make their\r\nexpression effectual.\r\n\r\nThe actual facts of his public life do not anywhere show that his politics\r\nshifted with his own interests. On the contrary, he was singularly\r\nregardless of his interests where his convictions interposed. Though an\r\nalien, and always an alien, he possessed none of the shifty traits of the\r\nsoldier of fortune. Never in his career did he crook the pregnant hinges of\r\nthe knee before any worldly throne of grace or flatter any mob that place\r\nmight follow fawning. His great talents had only to lend themselves to\r\nparty uses to get their full requital. He refused them equally to Grant in\r\nthe White House and the multitude in Missouri, going his own gait, which\r\ncould be called erratic only by the conventional, to whom regularity is\r\neverything and individuality nothing.\r\n\r\nSchurz was first of all and above all an orator. His achievements on the\r\nplatform and in the Senate were undeniable. He was unsurpassed in debate.\r\nHe had no need to exploit himself. The single chapter in his life on which\r\nlight was desirable was the military episode. The cruel and false saying,\r\n\"I fight mit Sigel und runs mit Schurz,\" obviously the offspring of\r\nmalignity, did mislead many people, reënforced by the knowledge that Schurz\r\nwas not an educated soldier. How thoroughly he disposes of this calumny his\r\nmemoirs attest. Fuller, more convincing vindication could not be asked of\r\nany man; albeit by those familiar with the man himself it could not be\r\ndoubted that he had both courage and aptitude for military employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nA philosopher and an artist, he was drawn by circumstance into the vortex\r\nof affairs. Except for the stirring events of 1848, he might have lived\r\nand died a professor at Bonn or Heidelberg. If he had pursued his musical\r\nstudies at Leipsic he must have become a master of the piano keyboard. As\r\nit was, he played Schumann and Chopin creditably. The rescue of Kinkel,\r\nthe flight from the fatherland, the mild Bohemianizing in Paris and London\r\nawakened within him the spirit of action rather than of adventure.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of the Dalgetty about him; too reflective and too\r\naccomplished. His early marriage attests a domestic trend, from which he\r\nnever departed; though an idealist in his public aspirations and aims he\r\nwas a sentimentalist in his home life and affections. Genial in temperament\r\nand disposition, his personal habit was moderation itself.\r\n\r\nHe was a German. Never did a man live so long in a foreign country and take\r\non so few of its thoughts and ways. He threw himself into the anti-slavery\r\nmovement upon the crest of the wave; the flowing sea carried him quickly\r\nfrom one distinction to another; the ebb tide, which found him in the\r\nSenate of the United States, revealed to his startled senses the creeping,\r\ncrawling things beneath the surface; partyism rampant, tyrannous and\r\ncorrupt; a self-willed soldier in the White House; a Blaine, a Butler and a\r\nGarfield leading the Representatives, a Cameron and a Conkling leading the\r\nSenate; single-minded disinterestedness, pure unadulterated conviction,\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\nJobs and jobbing flourished on every side. An impossible scheme of\r\nreconstruction was trailing its slow, putrescent length along. The revenue\r\nservice was thick with thieves, the committees of Congress were packed with\r\nmercenaries. Money-making in high places had become the order of the day.\r\nWas it for this that oceans of patriotism, of treasure and of blood had\r\nbeen poured out? Was it for this that he had fought with tongue and pen and\r\nsword?\r\n\r\nThere was Sumner--the great Sumner--who had quarreled with Grant and Fish,\r\nto keep him company and urge him on. There was the Tribune, the puissant\r\nTribune--two of them, one in New York and the other in Chicago--to give\r\nhim countenance. There was need of liberalizing and loosening things in\r\nMissouri, for which he sat in the Senate--they could not go on forever half\r\nthe best elements in the State disfranchised.\r\n\r\nThus the Liberal Movement of 1872.\r\n\r\nSchurz went to Cincinnati elate with hope. He was an idealist--not quite\r\nyet a philosopher. He had his friends about him. Sam Bowles--the first\r\nnewspaper politician of his day, with none of the handicaps carried by\r\nRaymond and Forney--a man keen of insight and foresight, fertile of\r\nresources, and not afraid--stood foremost among them. Next came Horace\r\nWhite. Doric in his simplicity like a marble shaft, and to the outer eye\r\nas cold as marble, but below a man of feeling, conviction and tenacity, a\r\nworking journalist and a doughty doctrinaire. A little group of such men\r\nformed itself about Schurz--then only forty-three years old--to what end?\r\nWhy, Greeley, Horace Greeley, the bellwether of abolitionism, the king bee\r\nof protectionism, the man of fads and isms and the famous \"old white hat.\"\r\n\r\nTo some of us it was laughable. To Schurz it was tragical. A bridge had to\r\nbe constructed for him to pass--for retrace his steps he could not--and,\r\nas it were, blindfolded, he had to be backed upon this like a mule aboard\r\na train of cars. I sometimes wonder what might have happened if Schurz had\r\nthen and there resigned his seat in the Senate, got his brood together and\r\nreturned to Germany. I dare say he would have been welcomed by Bismarck.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was no lodgment for him thenceforward in American politics.\r\nThe exigencies of 1876-77 made him a provisional place in the Hayes\r\nAdministration; but, precisely as the Democrats of Missouri could put such\r\na man to no use, the Republicans at large could find no use for him. He\r\nseemed a bull in a china shop to the political organization he honored with\r\na preference wholly intellectual, and having no stomach for either extreme,\r\nhe became a Mugwump.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a German. He was an artist. By nature a doctrinaire, he had become\r\na philosopher. He could never wholly adjust himself to his environment.\r\nHe lectured Lincoln, and Lincoln, perceiving his earnest truthfulness and\r\ngenuine qualities, forgave him his impertinence, nor ceased to regard him\r\nwith the enduring affection one might have for an ardent, aspiring and\r\nlovable boy. He was repellant to Grant, who could not and perhaps did\r\nnot desire to understand him.... To him the Southerners were always the\r\nred-faced, swashbuckling slave-drivers he had fancied and pictured them in\r\nthe days of his abolition oratory. More and more he lived in a rut of his\r\nown fancies, wise in books and counsels, gentle in his relations with the\r\nfew who enjoyed his confidence; to the last a most captivating personality.\r\n\r\nThough fastidious, Schurz was not intolerant. Yet he was hard to\r\nconvince--tenacious of his opinions--courteous but insistent in debate. He\r\nwas a German; a German Herr Doktor of Music, of Letters and of Common Law.\r\nDuring an intimacy of more than thirty years we scarcely ever wholly agreed\r\nabout any public matter; differing about even the civil service and the\r\ntariff. But I admired him hugely and loved him heartily.\r\n\r\nI had once a rather amusing encounter with him. There was a dinner at\r\nDelmonico's, from whose program of post-prandial oratory I had purposely\r\ncaused my own name to be omitted. Indeed, I had had with a lady a wager I\r\nvery much wished to win that I would not speak. General Grant and I went in\r\ntogether, and during the repast he said that the only five human beings in\r\nthe world whom he detested were actually here at table.\r\n\r\nOf course, Schurz was one of these. He was the last on the list of speakers\r\nand, curiously enough--the occasion being the consideration of certain\r\nways and means for the development of the South--and many leading\r\nSoutherners present--he composed his speech out of an editorial tour de\r\nforce he was making in the Evening Post on The Homicidal Side of Southern\r\nLife. Before he had proceeded half through General Grant, who knew of my\r\nwager, said, \"You'll lose your bet,\" and, it being one o'clock in the\r\nmorning, I thought so too, and did not care whether I won or lost it. When\r\nhe finished, the call on me was spontaneous and universal. \"Now give it to\r\nhim good,\" said General Grant.\r\n\r\nAnd I did; I declared--the reporters were long since gone--that there had\r\nnot been a man killed amiss in Kentucky since the war; that where one had\r\nbeen killed two should have been; and, amid roars of laughter which gave me\r\ntime to frame some fresh absurdity, I delivered a prose paean to murder.\r\n\r\nNobody seemed more pleased than Schurz himself, and as we came\r\naway--General Grant having disappeared--he put his arm about me like a\r\nschoolboy and said: \"Well, well, I had no idea you were so bloody-minded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Fifth\r\n\r\n    Every Trade Has Its Tricks--I Play One on William McKinley--Far Away\r\n    Party Politics and Political Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are tricks in every trade. The tariff being the paramount issue of\r\nthe day, I received a tempting money offer from Philadelphia to present my\r\nside of the question, but when the time fixed was about to arrive I found\r\nmyself billed for a debate with no less an adversary than William McKinley,\r\nprotectionist leader in the Lower House of Congress. We were the best of\r\nfriends and I much objected to a joint meeting. The parties, however, would\r\ntake no denial, and it was arranged that we should be given alternate\r\ndates. Then it appeared that the designated thesis read: \"Which political\r\nparty offers for the workingman the best solution of the tariff problem?\"\r\n\r\nHere was a poser. It required special preparation, for which I had not the\r\nleisure. I wanted the stipend, but was not willing--scarcely able--to pay\r\nso much for it. I was about to throw the engagement over when a lucky\r\nthought struck me. I had a cast-off lecture entitled Money and Morals. It\r\nhad been rather popular. Why might I not put a head and tail to this--a\r\nforeword and a few words in conclusion--and make it meet the purpose and\r\nserve the occasion?\r\n\r\nWhen the evening arrived there was a great audience. Half of the people had\r\ncome to applaud, the other half to antagonize. I was received, however,\r\nwith what seemed a united acclaim. When the cheering had ceased, with the\r\nblandest air I began:\r\n\r\n\"In that chapter of the history of Ireland which was reserved for the\r\nconsideration of snakes, the historian, true to the solecism as well as the\r\nbrevity of Irish wit, informs us that 'there are no snakes in Ireland.'\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that on the present occasion I shall have to emulate this\r\nflight of the Celtic imagination. I find myself billed to speak from a\r\nDemocratic standpoint as to which party offers the best practical means for\r\nthe benefit of the workingmen of the country. If I am to discharge with\r\nfidelity the duty thus assigned me, I must begin by repudiating the text in\r\ntoto, because the Democratic Party recognizes no political agency for one\r\nclass which is not equally open to all classes. The bulwark and belltower\r\nof its faith, the source and resource of its strength are laid in the\r\ndeclaration, 'Freedom for all, special privileges to none,' which applied\r\nto practical affairs would deny to self-styled workingmen, organized into\r\na coöperative society, any political means not enjoyed by every other\r\norganized coöperative society, and by each and every citizen, individually,\r\nto himself and his heirs and assigns, forever.\r\n\r\n\"But in a country like ours, what right has any body of men to get together\r\nand, labelling themselves workingmen, to talk about political means and\r\npractical ends exclusive to themselves? Who among us has the single\r\nright to claim for himself, and the likes of him, the divine title of a\r\nworkingman? We are all workingmen, the earnest plodding scholar in his\r\nlibrary, surrounded by the luxury and comfort which his learning and his\r\nlabor have earned for him, no less than the poor collier in the mine, with\r\ndarkness and squalor closing him round about, and want maybe staring him in\r\nthe face, yet--if he be a true man--with a little bird singing ever in his\r\nheart the song of hope and cheer which cradled the genius of Stephenson and\r\nArkwright and the long procession of inventors, lowly born, to whom\r\nthe world owes the glorious achievements of this, the greatest of the\r\ncenturies. We are all workingmen--the banker, the minister, the lawyer, the\r\ndoctor--toiling from day to day, and it may be we are well paid for our\r\ntoil, to represent and to minister to the wants of the time no less than\r\nthe farmer and the farmer's boy, rising with the lark to drive the team\r\nafield, and to dally with land so rich it needs to be but tickled with a\r\nhoe to laugh a harvest.\r\n\r\n\"Having somewhat of an audacious fancy, I have sometimes in moments of\r\nexuberance ventured upon the conceit that our Jupiter Tonans, the American\r\neditor, seated upon his three-legged throne and enveloped by the majesty\r\nand the mystery of his pretentious 'we,' is a workingman no less than the\r\npoor reporter, who year in and year out braves the perils of the midnight\r\nrounds through the slums of the city, yea in the more perilous temptations\r\nof the town, yet carries with him into the darkest dens the love of work,\r\nthe hope of reward and the fear only of dishonor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the poor officeseeker at Washington begging a bit of that pie, which,\r\nhaving got his own slice, a cruel, hard-hearted President would eliminate\r\nfrom the bill of fare, he likewise is a workingman, and I can tell you a\r\nvery hard-working man with a tough job of work, and were better breaking\r\nrock upon a turnpike in Dixie or splitting rails on a quarter section out\r\nin the wild and woolly West.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that, as stated on the program, I am a Democrat--as Artemus\r\nWard once said of the horses in his panorama, I can conceal it no\r\nlonger--at least I am as good a Democrat as they have nowadays. But first\r\nof all, I am an American, and in America every man who is not a policeman\r\nor a dude is a workingman. So, by your leave, my friends, instead of\r\nsticking very closely to the text, and treating it from a purely party\r\npoint of view, I propose to take a ramble through the highways and byways\r\nof life and thought in our beloved country and to cast a balance if I can\r\nfrom an American point of view.\r\n\r\n\"I want to say in the beginning that no party can save any man or any set\r\nof men from the daily toil by which all of us live and move and have our\r\nbeing.\"\r\n\r\nThen I worked in my old lecture.\r\n\r\nIt went like hot cakes. When next I met William McKinley he said jocosely:\r\n\"You are a mean man, Henry Watterson!\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I accepted the invitation to answer you because I wanted and needed the\r\nmoney. Of course I had no time to prepare a special address. My idea was to\r\nmake my fee by ripping you up the back. But when I read the verbatim report\r\nwhich had been prepared for me there was not a word with which I could take\r\nissue, and that completely threw me out.\"\r\n\r\nThen I told him how it had happened and we had a hearty laugh. He was the\r\nmost lovable of men. That such a man should have fallen a victim to the\r\nblow of an assassin defies explanation, as did the murders of Lincoln and\r\nGarfield, like McKinley, amiable, kindly men giving never cause of personal\r\noffense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe murderer is past finding out. In one way and another I fancy that I am\r\nwell acquainted with the assassins of history. Of those who slew Cæsar I\r\nlearned in my schooldays, and between Ravaillac, who did the business for\r\nHenry of Navarre, and Booth and Guiteau, my familiar knowledge seems almost\r\nat first hand. One night at Chamberlin's, in Washington, George Corkhill,\r\nthe district attorney who was prosecuting the murderer of Garfield, said\r\nto me: \"You will never fully understand this case until you have sat by me\r\nthrough one day's proceedings in court.\" Next day I did this.\r\n\r\nNever have I passed five hours in a theater so filled with thrills. I\r\noccupied a seat betwixt Corkhill and Scoville, Guiteau's brother-in-law\r\nand voluntary attorney. I say \"voluntary\" because from the first Guiteau\r\nrejected him and vilely abused him, vociferously insisting upon being his\r\nown lawyer.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Guiteau entered the trial room it was a theatrical\r\nextravaganza. He was in irons, sandwiched between two deputy sheriffs, came\r\nin shouting like a madman, and began at once railing at the judge, the jury\r\nand the audience. A very necessary rule had been established that when he\r\ninterposed, whatever was being said or done automatically stopped. Then,\r\nwhen he ceased, the case went on again as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nOnly Scoville intervened between me and Guiteau and I had an excellent\r\nopportunity to see, hear and size him up. In visage and voice he was the\r\nmeanest creature I have, either in life or in dreams, encountered. He had\r\nthe face and intonations of a demon. Everything about him was loathsome.\r\nI cannot doubt that his criminal colleagues of history were of the same\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Corday was surely a lunatic. Wilkes Booth I knew. He was drunk,\r\nhad been drunk all that winter, completely muddled and perverted by brandy,\r\nthe inheritant of mad blood. Czolgosz, the slayer of McKinley, and the\r\nassassin of the Empress Elizabeth were clearly insane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKinley and Protectionism, Cleveland, Carlisle and Free Trade--how far\r\naway they seem!\r\n\r\nWith the passing of the old issues that divided parties new issues have\r\ncome upon the scene. The alignment of the future will turn upon these. But\r\nunderlying all issues of all time are fundamental ideas which live forever\r\nand aye, and may not be forgotten or ignored.\r\n\r\nIt used to be claimed by the followers of Jefferson that Democracy was\r\na fixed quantity, rising out of the bedrock of the Constitution, while\r\nFederalism, Whiggism and Republicanism were but the chimeras of some\r\nprevailing fancy drawing their sustenance rather from temporizing\r\nexpediency and current sentiment than from basic principles and profound\r\nconviction. To make haste slowly, to look before leaping, to take counsel\r\nof experience--were Democratic axioms. Thus the fathers of Democracy, while\r\nfully conceiving the imperfections of government and meeting as events\r\nrequired the need alike of movement and reform, put the visionary and\r\nexperimental behind them to aim at things visible, attainable, tangible,\r\nthe written Constitution the one safe precedent, the morning star and the\r\nevening star of their faith and hope.\r\n\r\nWhat havoc the parties and the politicians have made of all these lofty\r\npretenses! Where must an old-line Democrat go to find himself? Two issues,\r\nhowever, have come upon the scene which for the time being are paramount\r\nand which seem organic. They are set for the determination of the twentieth\r\ncentury: The sex question and the drink question.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it be possible to consider them in a catholic spirit from a\r\nphilosophic standpoint. I can truly say that the enactment of prohibition\r\nlaws, state or national, is personally nothing to me. I long ago reached an\r\nage when the convivialism of life ceased to cut any figure in the equation\r\nof my desires and habits. It is the never-failing recourse of the\r\nintolerant, however, to ascribe an individual, and, of course, an unworthy,\r\nmotive to contrariwise opinions, and I have not escaped that kind of\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nThe challenge underlying prohibition is twofold: Does prohibition prohibit,\r\nand, if it does, may it not generate evils peculiarly its own?\r\n\r\nThe question hinges on what are called \"sumptuary laws\"; that is, statutes\r\nregulating the food and drink, the habits and apparel of the individual\r\ncitizen. This in turn harks back to the issue of paternal government. That,\r\nonce admitted and established, becomes in time all-embracing.\r\n\r\nBigotry is a disease. The bigot pursuing his narrow round is like the\r\nbedridden possessed by his disordered fancy. Bigotry sees nothing but\r\nitself, which it mistakes for wisdom and virtue. But Bigotry begets\r\nhypocrisy. When this spreads over a sufficient area and counts a voting\r\nmajority it sends its agents abroad, and thus we acquire canting apostles\r\nand legislators at once corrupt and despotic.\r\n\r\nThey are now largely in evidence in the national capital and in the various\r\nstate capitals, where the poor-dog, professional politicians most do\r\ncongregate and disport themselves.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is that there seems nowhere any popular\r\nrealization--certainly any popular outcry. Do the people grow degenerate?\r\nAre they willfully dense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Sixth\r\n\r\n    A Libel on Mr. Cleveland--His Fondness for Cards--Some Poker\r\n    Stories--The \"Senate Game\"--Tom Ochiltree, Senator Allison and General\r\n    Schenck\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long after Mr. Cleveland's marriage, being in Washington, I made a box\r\nparty embracing Mrs. Cleveland, and the Speaker and Mrs. Carlisle, at one\r\nof the theaters where Madame Modjeska was appearing. The ladies expressing\r\na desire to meet the famous Polish actress who had so charmed them, I took\r\nthem after the play behind the scenes. Thereafter we returned to the White\r\nHouse where supper was awaiting us, the President amused and pleased when\r\ntold of the agreeable incident.\r\n\r\nThe next day there began to buzz reports to the contrary. At first covert,\r\nthey gained in volume and currency until a distinguished Republican party\r\nleader put his imprint upon them in an after-dinner speech, going the\r\nlength of saying the newly-wedded Chief Magistrate had actually struck his\r\nwife and forbidden me the Executive Mansion, though I had been there every\r\nday during the week that followed.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland believed the matter too preposterous to be given any credence\r\nand took it rather stoically. But naturally Mrs. Cleveland was shocked and\r\noutraged, and I made haste to stigmatize it as a lie out of whole cloth.\r\nYet though this was sent away by the Associated Press and published\r\nbroadcast I have occasionally seen it referred to by persons over eager to\r\nassail a man incapable of an act of rudeness to a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland was fond--not overfond--of cards. He liked to play the noble\r\ngame at, say, a dollar limit--even once in a while for a little more--but\r\nnot much more. And as Dr. Norvin Green was wont to observe of Commodore\r\nVanderbilt, \"he held them exceeding close to his boo-som.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitney, Secretary of the Navy in his first administration, equally\r\nrich and hospitable, had often \"the road gang,\" as a certain group, mainly\r\nsenators, was called, to dine, with the inevitable after-dinner soirée or\r\nséance. I was, when in Washington, invited to these parties. At one of\r\nthem I chanced to sit between the President and Senator Don Cameron. Mr.\r\nCarlisle, at the time Speaker of the House--who handled his cards like\r\na child and, as we all knew, couldn't play a little--was seated on the\r\nopposite side of the table.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Mr. Cameron and I began \"bluffing\" the game--I recall that\r\nthe limit was five dollars--that is, raising and back-raising each other,\r\nand whoever else happened to be in, without much or any regard to the cards\r\nwe held.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on a deal that I picked up a pat flush, Mr. Cleveland a pat\r\nfull. The Pennsylvania senator and I went to the extreme, the President of\r\ncourse willing enough for us to play his hand for him. But the Speaker of\r\nthe House persistently stayed with us and could not be driven out.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to a draw Senator Cameron drew one card. Mr. Cleveland and I\r\nstood pat. But Mr. Carlisle drew four cards. At length, after much banter\r\nand betting, it reached a show-down and, _mirabile dictu_, the Speaker\r\nheld four kings!\r\n\r\n\"Take the money, Carlisle; take the money,\" exclaimed the President. \"If\r\never I am President again you shall be Secretary of the Treasury. But don't\r\nyou make that four-card draw too often.\"\r\n\r\nHe was President again, and Mr. Carlisle was Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had arisen a disagreeable misunderstanding between General Schenck\r\nand myself during the period when the general was Minister at the Court of\r\nSt. James. In consequence of this we did not personally meet. One evening\r\nat Chamberlin's years after, a party of us--mainly the Ohio statesman's\r\nold colleagues in Congress--were playing poker. He came in and joined us.\r\nNeither of us knew the other even by sight and there was no presentation\r\nwhen he sat in.\r\n\r\nAt length a direct play between the newcomer and me arose. There was a\r\nmoment's pause. Obviously we were strangers. Then it was that Senator\r\nAllison, of Iowa, who had in his goodness of heart purposely brought about\r\nthis very situation, introduced us. The general reddened. I was taken\r\naback. But there was no escape, and carrying it off amiably we shook hands.\r\nIt is needless to say that then and there we dropped our groundless feud\r\nand remained the rest of his life very good friends.\r\n\r\nIn this connection still another poker story. Sam Bugg, the Nashville\r\ngambler, was on a Mississippi steamer bound for New Orleans. He came upon\r\na party of Tennesseeans whom a famous card sharp had inveigled and was\r\nflagrantly robbing. Sam went away, obtained a pack of cards, and stacked\r\nthem to give the gambler four kings and the brightest one of the Nashville\r\nboys four aces. After two or three failures to bring the cold deck into\r\naction Sam Bugg brushed a spider--an imaginary spider, of course--from the\r\ngambler's coat collar, for an instant distracting his attention--and in\r\nthe momentary confusion the stacked cards were duly dealt and the betting\r\nbegan, the gambler confident and aggressive. Finally, all the money up,\r\nthe four aces beat the four kings, and for a greater amount than the\r\nNashvillians had lost and the gambler had won. Whereupon, without change\r\nof muscle, the gambler drawled: \"Mr. Bugg, the next time you see a spider\r\nbiting me let him bite on!\"\r\n\r\nI was told that the Senate Game had been played during the War of Sections\r\nand directly after for large sums. With the arrival of the rebel brigadiers\r\nit was perforce reduced to a reasonable limit.\r\n\r\nThe \"road gang\" was not unknown at the White House. Sometimes it assembled\r\nat private houses, but its accustomed place of meeting was first Welcker's\r\nand then Chamberlin's. I do not know whether it continues to have abiding\r\nplace or even an existence. In spite of the reputation given me by the\r\npert paragraphers I have not been on a race course or seen a horse race or\r\nplayed for other than immaterial stakes for more than thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an all-round newspaper writer and reporter many sorts of people, high\r\nand low, little and big, queer and commonplace, fell in my way; statesmen\r\nand politicians, artists and athletes, circus riders and prize fighters;\r\nthe riffraff and the élite; the professional and dilettante of the world\r\npolite and the underworld.\r\n\r\nI knew Mike Walsh and Tim Campbell. I knew John Morrissey. I have seen\r\nHeenan--one of the handsomest men of his time--and likewise Adah Isaacs\r\nMenken, his inamorata--many said his wife--who went into mourning for him\r\nand thereafter hied away to Paris, where she lived under the protection\r\nof Alexandre Dumas, the elder, who buried her in Père Lachaise under a\r\nhandsome monument bearing two words, \"Thou knowest,\" beneath a carved hand\r\npointed to heaven.\r\n\r\nI did draw the line, however, at Cora Pearl and Marcus Cicero Stanley.\r\n\r\nThe Parisian courtesan was at the zenith of her extraordinary celebrity\r\nwhen I became a rustic boulevardier. She could be seen everywhere and on\r\nall occasions. Her gowns were the showiest, her equipage the smartest; her\r\nentourage, loud though it was and vulgar, yet in its way was undeniable.\r\nShe reigned for a long time the recognized queen of the demi-monde. I\r\nhave beheld her in her glory on her throne--her two thrones, for she had\r\ntwo--one on the south side of the river, the other at the east end--not to\r\nmention the race course--surrounded by a retinue of the disreputable. She\r\ndid not awaken in me the least curiosity, and I declined many opportunities\r\nto meet her.\r\n\r\nMarcus Cicero Stanley was sprung from an aristocratic, even a\r\ndistinguished, North Carolina family. He came to New York and set up for a\r\nswell. How he lived I never cared to find out, though he was believed to\r\nbe what the police call a \"fence.\" He seemed a cross between a \"con\" and\r\na \"beat.\" Yet for a while he flourished at Delmonico's, which he made his\r\nheadquarters, and cut a kind of dash with the unknowing. He was a handsome,\r\nmannerly brute who knew how to dress and carry himself like a gentleman.\r\n\r\nLater there came to New York another Southerner--a Far Southerner of a\r\nvery different quality--who attracted no little attention. This was Tom\r\nOchiltree. He, too, was well born, his father an eminent jurist of Texas;\r\nhe, himself, a wit, _bon homme_ and raconteur. Travers once said: \"We\r\nhave three professional liars in America--Tom Ochiltree is one and George\r\nAlfred Townsend is the other two.\"\r\n\r\nThe stories told of Tom would fill a book. He denied none, however\r\npreposterous--was indeed the author of many of the most amusing--of how,\r\nwhen the old judge proposed to take him into law partnership he caused to\r\nbe painted an office sign: Thomas P. Ochiltree and Father; of his reply to\r\nGeneral Grant, who had made him United States Marshal of Texas, and later\r\nsuggested that it would be well for Tom to pay less attention to the race\r\ncourse: \"Why, Mr. President, all that turf publicity relates to a horse\r\nnamed after me, not to me,\" it being that the horse of the day had been so\r\ncalled; and of General Grant's reply: \"Nevertheless, it would be well,\r\nTom, for you to look in upon Texas once in a while\"--in short, of his\r\nmany sayings and exploits while a member of Congress from the Galveston\r\ndistrict; among the rest, that having brought in a resolution tendering\r\nsympathy to the German Empire on the death of Herr Laska, the most advanced\r\nand distinguished of Radical Socialists, which became for the moment a\r\n_cause célébre_. Tom remarked, \"Not that I care a damn about it,\r\nexcept for the prominence it gives to Bismarck.\"\r\n\r\nHe lived when in Washington at Chamberlin's. He and John Chamberlin were\r\nclose friends. Once when he was breakfasting with John a mutual friend came\r\nin. He was in doubt what to order. Tom suggested beefsteak and onions.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected the newcomer, \"I am about to call on some ladies, and the\r\nsmell of onions on my breath, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let that trouble you,\" said Tom; \"you have the steak and onions and\r\nwhen you get your bill that will take your breath away!\"\r\n\r\nUnder an unpromising exterior--a stocky build and fiery red head--there\r\nglowed a brave, generous and tender spirit. The man was a _preux\r\nchevalier_. He was a knight-errant. All women--especially all good and\r\ndiscerning women who knew him and who could intuitively read beneath that\r\nclumsy personality his fine sense of respect--even of adoration--loved Tom\r\nOchiltree.\r\n\r\nThe equivocal celebrity he enjoyed was largely fostered by himself, his\r\nstories mostly at his own expense. His education had been but casual. But\r\nhe had a great deal of it and a varied assortment. He knew everybody on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic, his friends ranging from the Prince of Wales,\r\nafterward Edward VII, Gladstone and Disraeli, Gambetta and Thiers, to\r\nthe bucks of the jockey clubs. There were two of Tom--Tom the noisy on\r\nexhibition, and Tom the courtier in society.\r\n\r\nHow he lived when out of office was the subject of unflattering conjecture.\r\nMany thought him the stipendiary of Mr. Mackay, the multimillionaire, with\r\nwhom he was intimate, who told me he could never induce Tom to take money\r\nexcept for service rendered. Among his familiars was Colonel North, the\r\nEnglish money magnate, who said the same thing. He had a widowed sister\r\nin Texas to whom he regularly sent an income sufficient for herself and\r\nfamily. And when he died, to the surprise of every one, he left his sister\r\nquite an accumulation. He had never been wholly a spendthrift. Though he\r\nlived well at Chamberlin's in Washington and the Waldorf in New York he was\r\ncareful of his credit and his money. I dare say he was not unfortunate in\r\nthe stock market. He never married and when he died, still a youngish man\r\nas modern ages go, all sorts of stories were told of him, and the space\r\nwriters, having a congenial subject, disported themselves voluminously.\r\nInevitably most of their stories were apocryphal.\r\n\r\nI wonder shall we ever get any real truth out of what is called history?\r\nThere are so many sides to it and such a confusing din of voices. How much\r\ndoes old Sam Johnson owe of the fine figure he cuts to Boswell, and, minus\r\nBoswell, how much would be left of him? For nearly a century the Empress\r\nJosephine was pictured as the effigy of the faithful and suffering wife\r\nsacrificed upon the altar of unprincipled and selfish ambition--lovelorn,\r\ndeserted, heartbroken. It was Napoleon, not Josephine, except in her pride,\r\nwho suffered. Who shall tell us the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth, about Hamilton; about Burr; about Cæsar, Caligula and Cleopatra?\r\nDid Washington, when he was angry, swear like a trooper? What was the\r\nmatter with Nero?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Edward King and I were dining in the Champs Elysées when\r\nhe said: \"There is a new coon--a literary coon--come to town. He is a\r\nScotchman and his name is Robert Louis Stevenson.\" Then he told me of Dr.\r\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde. At that moment the subject of our talk was living in\r\na kind of self-imposed penury not half a mile away. Had we known this we\r\ncould have ended the poor fellow's struggle with his pride and ambition\r\nthen and there; have put him in the way of sure work and plenty of it;\r\nperhaps have lengthened, certainly have sweetened, his days, unless it be\r\ntrue that he was one of the impossibles, as he may easily be conceived to\r\nhave been from reading his wayward biography and voluminous correspondence.\r\n\r\nTo a young Kentuckian, one of \"my boys,\" was given the opportunity to see\r\nthe last of him and to bury him in far-away Samoa, whither he had taken\r\nhimself for the final adventure and where he died, having attained some\r\nmeasure of the dreams he had cherished, and, let us hope, happy in the\r\nconsciousness of the achievement.\r\n\r\nI rather think Stevenson should be placed at the head of the latter-day\r\nfictionists. But fashions in literature as in dress are ever changing.\r\nWashington Irving was the first of our men of letters to obtain foreign\r\nrecognition. While the fires of hate between Great Britain and America were\r\nstill burning he wrote kindly and elegantly of England and the English, and\r\nwas accepted on both sides of the ocean. Taking his style from Addison and\r\nGoldsmith, he emulated their charity and humor; he went to Spain and in the\r\nsame deft way he pictured the then unknown byways of the land of dreams;\r\nand coming home again he peopled the region of the Hudson with the beings\r\nof legend and fancy which are dear to us.\r\n\r\nHe became our national man of letters. He stood quite at the head of our\r\nliterature, giving the lie to the scornful query, \"Who reads an American\r\nbook?\" As a pioneer he will always be considered; as a simple and vivid\r\nwriter of things familiar and entertaining he will probably always be read;\r\nbut as an originator literary history will hardly place him very high.\r\nThere Bret Harte surely led him. The Tales of the Argonauts as works of\r\ncreative fancy exceed the Sketches of Washington Irving alike in wealth of\r\ncolor and humor, in pathos and dramatic action.\r\n\r\nSome writers make an exception of the famous Sleepy Hollow story. But they\r\nhave in mind the Rip Van Winkle of Jefferson and Boucicault, not the\r\nrather attenuated story of Irving, which--as far as the twenty years of\r\nsleep went--was borrowed from an old German legend.\r\n\r\nMark Twain and Bret Harte, however, will always be bracketed with\r\nWashington Irving. Of the three I incline to the opinion that Mark Twain\r\ndid the broadest and strongest work. His imagination had wider reach than\r\nIrving's. There is nowhere, as there is in Harte, the suspicion either of\r\ninsincerity or of artificiality. Irving's humor was the humor of Sir Roger\r\nde Coverley and the Vicar of Wakefield. It is old English. Mark Twain's is\r\nhis own--American through and through to the bone. I am not unmindful of\r\nCooper and Hawthorne, of Longfellow, of Lowell and of Poe, but speak of\r\nIrving as the pioneer American man of letters, and of Mark Twain and\r\nBret Harte as American literature's most conspicuous and original modern\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Seventh\r\n\r\n    The Profession of Journalism--Newspapers and Editors in\r\n    America--Bennett, Greeley and Raymond--Forney and Dana--The Education\r\n    of a Journalist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American newspaper has had, even in my time, three separate and\r\ndistinct epochs; the thick-and-thin, more or less servile party organ; the\r\npersonal, one-man-controlled, rather blatant and would-be independent; and\r\nthe timorous, corporation, or family-owned billboard of such news as the\r\never-increasing censorship of a constantly centralizing Federal Government\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\nThis latter appears to be its present state. Neither its individuality nor\r\nits self-exploitation, scarcely its grandiose pretension, remains. There\r\ncontinues to be printed in large type an amount of shallow stuff that would\r\nnot be missed if it were omitted altogether. But, except as a bulletin of\r\nyesterday's doings, limited, the daily newspaper counts for little, the\r\nsingle advantage of the editor--in case there is an editor--that is, one\r\nclothed with supervising authority who \"edits\"--being that he reaches the\r\npublic with his lucubrations first, the sanctity that once hedged the\r\neditorial \"we\" long since departed.\r\n\r\nThe editor dies, even as the actor, and leaves no copy. Editorial\r\nreputations have been as ephemeral as the publications which gave them\r\ncontemporary importance. Without going as far back as the Freneaus and\r\nthe Callenders, who recalls the names of Mordecai Mannasseh Noah, of Edwin\r\nCrosswell and of James Watson Webb? In their day and generation they were\r\ninfluential and distinguished journalists. There are dozens of other names\r\nonce famous but now forgotten; George Wilkins Kendall; Gerard Hallock;\r\nErastus Brooks; Alexander Bullitt; Barnwell Rhett; Morton McMichael; George\r\nWilliam Childs, even Thomas Ritchie, Duff Green and Amos Kendall. \"Gales\r\nand Seaton\" sounds like a trade-mark; but it stood for not a little and\r\nlasted a long time in the National Capital, where newspaper vassalage and\r\nthe public printing went hand-in-hand.\r\n\r\nFor a time the duello flourished. There were frequent \"affairs of\r\nhonor\"--notably about Richmond in Virginia and Charleston in South\r\nCarolina--sometimes fatal meetings, as in the case of John H. Pleasants and\r\none of the sons of Thomas Ritchie in which Pleasants was killed, and the\r\nyet more celebrated affair between Graves, of Kentucky, and Cilley, of\r\nMaine, in which Cilley was killed; Bladensburg the scene, and the refusal\r\nof Cilley to recognize James Watson Webb the occasion.\r\n\r\nI once had an intimate account of this duel with all the cruel incidents\r\nfrom Henry A. Wise, a party to it, and a blood-curdling narrative it made.\r\nThey fought with rifles at thirty paces, and Cilley fell on the third fire.\r\nIt did much to discredit duelling in the South. The story, however, that\r\nGraves was so much affected that thereafter he could never sleep in a\r\ndarkened chamber had no foundation whatever, a fact I learned from my\r\nassociate in the old Louisville Journal and later in The Courier-Journal,\r\nMr. Isham Henderson, who was a brother-in-law of Mr. Graves, his sister,\r\nMrs. Graves, being still alive. The duello died at length. There was\r\nnever sufficient reason for its being. It was both a vanity and a fad. In\r\nHopkinson Smith's \"Col. Carter of Cartersville,\" its real character is hit\r\noff to the life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen very early, rather too early, I found myself in the saddle, Bennett\r\nand Greeley and Raymond in New York, and Medill and Storey in Chicago, were\r\nyet alive and conspicuous figures in the newspaper life of the time. John\r\nBigelow, who had retired from the New York Evening Post, was Minister to\r\nFrance. Halstead was coming on, but, except as a correspondent, Whitelaw\r\nReid had not \"arrived.\" The like was true of \"Joe\" McCullagh, who, in the\r\nsame character, divided the newspaper reading attention of the country with\r\nGeorge Alfred Townsend and Donn Piatt. Joseph Medill was withdrawing from\r\nthe Chicago Tribune in favor of Horace White, presently to return and die\r\nin harness--a man of sterling intellect and character--and Wilbur F.\r\nStorey, his local rival, who was beginning to show signs of the mental\r\nmalady that, developed into monomania, ultimately ended his life in gloom\r\nand despair, wrecking one of the finest newspaper properties outside of New\r\nYork. William R. Nelson, who was to establish a really great newspaper in\r\nKansas City, was still a citizen of Ft. Wayne.\r\n\r\nJames Gordon Bennett, the elder, seemed then to me, and has always\r\nseemed, the real founder of the modern newspaper as a vehicle of popular\r\ninformation, and, in point of apprehension, at least, James Gordon Bennett,\r\nthe younger, did not fall behind his father. What was, and might have been\r\nregarded and dismissed as a trivial slander drove him out of New York and\r\nmade him the greater part of his life a resident of Paris, where I was wont\r\nto meet and know much of him.\r\n\r\nThe New York Herald, under father and son, attained enormous prosperity,\r\nprestige and real power. It suffered chiefly from what they call in Ireland\r\n\"absentee landlordism.\" Its \"proprietor,\" for he never described himself\r\nas its \"editor,\" was a man of exquisite sensibilities--a \"despot\" of\r\ncourse--whom nature created for a good citizen, a good husband and the head\r\nof a happy domestic fabric. He should have married the woman of his choice,\r\nfor he was deeply in love with her and never ceased to love her, forty\r\nyears later leaving her in his will a handsome legacy.\r\n\r\nCrossing the ocean with the \"Commodore,\" as he was called by his familiars,\r\nnot long after he had taken up his residence abroad, naturally we fell\r\noccasionally into shop talk. \"What would you do,\" he once said, \"if you\r\nowned the Herald?\" \"Why,\" I answered, \"I would stay in New York and edit\r\nit;\" and then I proceeded, \"but you mean to ask me what I think you ought\r\nto do with it?\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"that is about the size of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Commodore,\" I answered, \"if I were you, when we get in I would send\r\nfor John Cockerill and make him managing editor, and for John Young, and\r\nput him in charge of the editorial page, and then I would go and lose\r\nmyself in the wilds of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nHe adopted the first two of these suggestions. John A. Cockerill was still\r\nunder contract with Joseph Pulitzer and could not accept for a year or\r\nmore. He finally did accept and died in the Bennett service. John Russell\r\nYoung took the editorial page and was making it \"hum\" when a most\r\nunaccountable thing happened. I was amazed to receive an invitation to a\r\ndinner he had tendered and was about to give to the quondam Virginian and\r\njust elected New York Justice Roger A. Pryor. \"Is Young gone mad,\" I said\r\nto myself, \"or can he have forgotten that the one man of all the world whom\r\nthe House of Bennett can never forget, or forgive, is Roger A. Pryor?\"\r\n\r\nThe Bennett-Pry or quarrel had been a _cause célèbre_ when John Young\r\nwas night editor of the Philadelphia Press and I was one of its Washington\r\ncorrespondents. Nothing so virulent had ever passed between an editor and a\r\nCongressman. In one of his speeches Pryor had actually gone the length of\r\nrudely referring to Mrs. James Gordon Bennett.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was duly given. But it ended John's connection with the Herald\r\nand his friendly relations with the owner of the Herald. The incident might\r\nbe cited as among \"The Curiosities of Journalism,\" if ever a book with that\r\ntitle is written. John's \"break\" was so bad that I never had the heart to\r\nask him how he could have perpetrated it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe making of an editor is a complex affair. Poets and painters are said to\r\nbe born. Editors and orators are made. Many essential elements enter into\r\nthe editorial fabrication; need to be concentrated upon and embodied by a\r\nsingle individual, and even, with these, environment is left to supply the\r\nopportunity and give the final touch.\r\n\r\nAptitude, as the first ingredient, goes without saying of every line of\r\nhuman endeavor. We have the authority of the adage for the belief that it\r\nis not possible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Yet have I known\r\nsome unpromising tyros mature into very capable workmen.\r\n\r\nThe modern newspaper, as we know it, may be fairly said to have been\r\nthe invention of James Gordon Bennett, the elder. Before him there were\r\njournals, not newspapers. When he died he had developed the news scheme in\r\nkind, though not in the degree that we see so elaborate and resplendent in\r\nNew York and other of the leading centers of population. Mr. Bennett had\r\nled a vagrant and varied life when he started the Herald. He had been many\r\nthings by turns, including a writer of verses and stories, but nothing very\r\nsuccessful nor very long. At length he struck a central idea--a really\r\ngreat, original idea--the idea of printing the news of the day, comprising\r\nthe History of Yesterday, fully and fairly, without fear or favor. He was\r\nfollowed by Greeley and Raymond--making a curious and very dissimilar\r\ntriumvirate--and, at longer range, by Prentice and Forney, by Bowles and\r\nDana, Storey, Medill and Halstead. All were marked men; Greeley a writer\r\nand propagandist; Raymond a writer, declaimer and politician; Prentice a\r\nwit and partisan; Dana a scholar and an organizer; Bowles a man both of\r\nletters and affairs. The others were men of all work, writing and fighting\r\ntheir way to the front, but possessing the \"nose for news,\" using the\r\nBennett formula and rescript as the basis of their serious efforts, and\r\nnever losing sight of it. Forney had been a printer. Medill and Storey were\r\ncaught young by the lure of printer's ink. Bowles was born and reared\r\nin the office of the Springfield Republican, founded by his father, and\r\nHalstead, a cross betwixt a pack horse and a race horse, was broken to\r\nharness before he was out of his teens.\r\n\r\nAssuming journalism, equally with medicine and law, to be a profession,\r\nit is the only profession in which versatility is not a disadvantage.\r\nSpecialism at the bar, or by the bedside, leads to perfection and\r\nattains results. The great doctor is the great surgeon or the great\r\nprescriptionist--he cannot be great in both--and the great lawyer is rarely\r\ngreat, if ever, as counselor and orator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry Watterson--From a painting by Louis Mark in the\r\nManhattan Club, New York]\r\n\r\nThe great editor is by no means the great writer. But he ought to be able\r\nto write and must be a judge of writing. The newspaper office is a little\r\nkingdom. The great editor needs to know and does know every range of it\r\nbetween the editorial room, the composing room and the pressroom. He must\r\nhold well in hand everybody and every function, having risen, as it were,\r\nstep-by-step from the ground floor to the roof. He should be level-headed,\r\nyet impressionable; sympathetic, yet self-possessed; able quickly to sift,\r\ndetect and discriminate; of various knowledge, experience and interest; the\r\ncackle of the adjacent barnyard the noise of the world to his eager mind\r\nand pliant ear. Nothing too small for him to tackle, nothing too great,\r\nhe should keep to the middle of the road and well in rear of the moving\r\ncolumns; loving his art--for such it is--for art's sake; getting his\r\nsufficiency, along with its independence, in the public approval and\r\npatronage, seeking never anything further for himself. Disinterestedness\r\nbeing the soul of successful journalism, unselfish devotion to every noble\r\npurpose in public and private life, he should say to preferment, as to\r\nbribers, \"get behind me, Satan.\" Whitelaw Reid, to take a ready and\r\nconspicuous example, was a great journalist, but rather early in life\r\nhe abandoned journalism for office and became a figure in politics and\r\ndiplomacy so that, as in the case of Franklin, whose example and footsteps\r\nin the main he followed, he will be remembered rather as the Ambassador\r\nthan as the Editor.\r\n\r\nMore and more must these requirements be fulfilled by the aspiring\r\njournalist. As the world passes from the Rule of Force--force of prowess,\r\nforce of habit, force of convention--to the Rule of Numbers, the daily\r\njournal is destined, if it survives as a power, to become the teacher--the\r\nvery Bible--of the people. The people are already beginning to distinguish\r\nbetween the wholesome and the meretricious in their newspapers. Newspaper\r\nowners, likewise, are beginning to realize the value of character.\r\nInstances might be cited where the public, discerning some sinister\r\nbut unseen power behind its press, has slowly yet surely withdrawn its\r\nconfidence and support. However impersonal it pretends to be, with whatever\r\nof mystery it affects to envelop itself, the public insists upon some\r\nvisible presence. In some States the law requires it. Thus \"personal\r\njournalism\" cannot be escaped, and whether the \"one-man power\" emanates\r\nfrom the Counting Room or the Editorial Room, as they are called, it must\r\nbe clear and answerable, responsive to the common weal, and, above all,\r\ntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Weiss Forney was among the most conspicuous men of his time. He was\r\nlikewise one of the handsomest. By nature and training a journalist, he\r\nplayed an active, not to say an equivocal, part in public life-at the\r\noutset a Democratic and then a Republican leader.\r\n\r\nBorn in the little town of Lancaster, it was his mischance to have attached\r\nhimself early in life to the fortunes of Mr. Buchanan, whom he long served\r\nwith fidelity and effect. But when Mr. Buchanan came to the Presidency,\r\nForney, who aspired first to a place in the Cabinet, which was denied him,\r\nand then to a seat in the Senate, for which he was beaten--through flagrant\r\nbribery, as the story ran--was left out in the cold. Thereafter he became\r\nsomething of a political adventurer.\r\n\r\nThe days of the newspaper \"organ\" aproached their end. Forney's occupation,\r\nlike Othello's, was gone, for he was nothing if not an organ grinder.\r\nFacile with pen and tongue, he seemed a born courtier--a veritable\r\nDalgetty, whose loyal devotion to his knight-at-arms deserved better\r\nrecognition than the cold and wary Pennsylvania chieftain was willing to\r\ngive. It is only fair to say that Forney's character furnished reasonable\r\nexcuse for this neglect and apparent ingratitude. The row between them,\r\nhowever, was party splitting. As the friend and backer of Douglas, and\r\nlater along a brilliant journalistic soldier of fortune, Forney did as much\r\nas any other man to lay the Democratic party low.\r\n\r\nI can speak of him with a certain familiarity and authority, for I was one\r\nof his \"boys.\" I admired him greatly and loved him dearly. Most of the\r\nyoung newspaper men about Philadelphia and Washington did so. He was an\r\nall-around modern journalist of the first class. Both as a newspaper writer\r\nand creator and manager, he stood upon the front line, rating with Bennett\r\nand Greeley and Raymond. He first entertained and then cultivated the\r\nthirst for office, which proved the undoing of Greeley and Raymond, and it\r\nproved his undoing. He had a passion for politics. He would shine in public\r\nlife. If he could not play first fiddle he would take any other instrument.\r\nThus failing of a Senatorship, he was glad to get the Secretaryship of the\r\nSenate, having been Clerk of the House.\r\n\r\nHe was bound to be in the orchestra. In those days newspaper independence\r\nwas little known. Mr. Greeley was willing to play bottle-holder to Mr.\r\nSeward, Mr. Prentice to Mr. Clay. James Gordon Bennett, the elder, and\r\nlater his son, James Gordon Bennett, the younger, challenged this kind of\r\nservility. The Herald stood at the outset of its career manfully in the\r\nface of unspeakable obloquy against it. The public understood it and rose\r\nto it. The time came when the elder Bennett was to attain official as well\r\nas popular recognition. Mr. Lincoln offered him the French mission and Mr.\r\nBennett declined it. He was rich and famous, and to another it might have\r\nseemed a kind of crowning glory. To him it seemed only a coming down--a\r\nbadge of servitude--a lowering of the flag of independent journalism under\r\nwhich, and under which alone, he had fought all his life.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Dana was not far behind the Bennetts in his independence.\r\nHe well knew what parties and politicians are. The most scholarly and\r\naccomplished of American journalists, he made the Sun \"shine for all,\" and,\r\nduring the years of his active management, a most prosperous property. It\r\nhappened that whilst I was penny-a-lining in New York I took a piece of\r\nspace work--not very common in those days--to the Tribune and received a\r\nfew dollars for it. Ten years later, meeting Mr. Dana at dinner, I recalled\r\nthe circumstance, and thenceforward we became the best of friends. Twice\r\nindeed we had runabouts together in foreign lands. His house in town, and\r\nthe island home called Dorsoris, which he had made for himself, might not\r\ninaptly be described as very shrines of hospitality and art, the master of\r\nthe house a virtuoso in music and painting no less than in letters. One\r\nmight meet under his roof the most diverse people, but always interesting\r\nand agreeable people. Perhaps at times he carried his aversions a little\r\ntoo far. But he had reasons for them, and a man of robust temperament and\r\nhabit, it was not in him to sit down under an injury, or fancied injury.\r\nI never knew a more efficient journalist. What he did not know about a\r\nnewspaper, was scarcely worth knowing.\r\n\r\nIn my day Journalism has made great strides. It has become a recognized\r\nprofession. Schools of special training are springing up here and there.\r\nSeveral of the universities have each its College of Journalism. The\r\ntendency to discredit these, which was general and pronounced at the start,\r\nlowers its tone and grows less confident.\r\n\r\nAssuredly there is room for special training toward the making of an\r\neditor. Too often the newspaper subaltern obtaining promotion through\r\naptitudes peculiarly his own, has failed to acquire even the most\r\nrudimentary knowledge of his art. He has been too busy seeking \"scoops\" and\r\ndoing \"stunts\" to concern himself about perspectives, principles, causes\r\nand effects, probable impressions and consequences, or even to master the\r\ntechnical details which make such a difference in the preparation of matter\r\nintended for publication and popular perusal. The School of Journalism may\r\nnot be always able to give him the needful instruction. But it can set him\r\nin the right direction and better prepare him to think and act for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Eighth\r\n\r\n    Bullies and Braggarts--Some Kentucky Illustrations--The Old Galt\r\n    House--The Throckmortons--A Famous Sugeon--\"Old Hell's Delight\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the bully and braggart is more in evidence in\r\nKentucky and Texas than in other Commonwealths of the Union, except that\r\neach is by the space writers made the favorite arena of his exploits\r\nand adopted as the scene of the comic stories told at his expense. The\r\nson-of-a-gun from Bitter Creek, like the \"elegant gentleman\" from the Dark\r\nand Bloody Ground, represents a certain type to be found more or less\r\ndeveloped in each and every State of the Union. He is not always a coward.\r\nDriven, as it were, to the wall, he will often make good.\r\n\r\nHe is as a rule in quest of adventures. He enters the village from the\r\ncountryside and approaches the mêlée. \"Is it a free fight?\" says he.\r\nAssured that it is, \"Count me in,\" says he. Ten minutes later, \"Is it still\r\na free fight?\" he says, and, again assured in the affirmative, says he,\r\n\"Count me out.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the greatest of bullies provoked old Aaron Pennington, \"the strongest\r\nman in the world,\" who struck out from the shoulder and landed his victim\r\nin the middle of the street. Here he lay in a helpless heap until they\r\ncarted him off to the hospital, where for a day or two he flickered between\r\nlife and death. \"Foh God,\" said Pennington, \"I barely teched him.\"\r\n\r\nThis same bully threatened that when a certain mountain man came to town\r\nhe would \"finish him.\" The mountain man came. He was enveloped in an\r\nold-fashioned cloak, presumably concealing his armament, and walked about\r\nostentatiously in the proximity of his boastful foeman, who remained as\r\npassive as a lamb. When, having failed to provoke a fight, he had taken\r\nhimself off, an onlooker said: \"Bill, I thought you were going to do him\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says Bill, \"did you see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw him. What of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed the bully, \"that man was a walking arsenal.\"\r\n\r\nAaron Pennington, the strong man just mentioned, was, in his younger\r\ndays, a river pilot. Billy Hite, a mite of a man, was clerk. They had a\r\ndisagreement, when Aaron told Billy that if he caught him on \"the harrican\r\ndeck,\" he would pitch him overboard. The next day Billy appeared whilst\r\nAaron, off duty, was strolling up and down outside the pilot-house, and\r\nstrolled offensively in his wake. Never a hostile glance or a word from\r\nAaron. At last, tired of dumb show, Billy broke forth with a torrent of\r\nimprecation closing with \"When are you going to pitch me off the boat, you\r\nblankety-blank son-of-a-gun and coward?\"\r\n\r\nAaron Pennington was a brave man. He was both fearless and self-possessed.\r\nHe paused, gazed quizzically at his little tormentor, and says he: \"Billy,\r\nyou got a pistol, and you want to get a pretext to shoot me, and I ain't\r\ngoing to give it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the hostels of Christendom the Galt House, of Louisville, for a long\r\ntime occupied a foremost place and held its own. It was burned to the\r\nground fifty years ago and a new Galt House was erected, not upon the\r\noriginal site, but upon the same street, a block above, and, although one\r\nof the most imposing buildings in the world, it could never be made to\r\nthrive. It stands now a rather useless encumbrance--a whited sepulchre--a\r\nmarble memorial of the Solid South and the Kentucky that was, on whose\r\nportal might truthfully appear the legend:\r\n\r\n  \"_A jolly place it was in days of old,\r\n  But something ails it now_\"\r\n\r\nAris Throckmorton, its manager in the Thirties, the Forties and the\r\nFifties, was a personality and a personage. The handsomest of men and the\r\nmost illiterate, he exemplified the characteristics and peculiarities of\r\nthe days of the river steamer and the stage coach, when \"mine host\" felt it\r\nhis duty to make the individual acquaintance of his patrons and each\r\nand severally to look after their comfort. Many stories are told at his\r\nexpense; of how he made a formal call upon Dickens--it was, in point of\r\nfact, Marryatt--in his apartment, to be coolly told that when its occupant\r\nwanted him he would ring for him; and of how, investigating a strange box\r\nwhich had newly arrived from Florida, the prevailing opinion being that the\r\nlive animal within was an alligator, he exclaimed, \"Alligator, hell; it's\r\na scorponicum.\" He died at length, to be succeeded by his son John, a very\r\ndifferent character. And thereby hangs a tale.\r\n\r\nJohn Throckmorton, like Aris, his father, was one of the handsomest of men.\r\nPerhaps because he was so he became the victim of one of the strangest of\r\nfeminine whimsies and human freaks. There was a young girl in Louisville,\r\nnamed Ellen Godwin. Meeting him at a public ball she fell violently in love\r\nwith him. As Throckmorton did not reciprocate this, and refused to pursue\r\nthe acquaintance, she began to dog his footsteps. She dressed herself in\r\ndeep black and took up a position in front of the Galt House, and when\r\nhe came out and wherever he went she followed him. No matter how long he\r\nstayed, when he reappeared she was on the spot and watch. He took himself\r\naway to San Francisco. It was but the matter of a few weeks when she was\r\nthere, too. He hied him thence to Liverpool, and as he stepped upon the\r\ndock there she was. She had got wind of his going and, having caught an\r\nearlier steamer, preceded him.\r\n\r\nFinally the War of Sections arrived. John Throckmorton hecame a Confederate\r\nofficer, and, being able to keep her out of the lines, he had a rest of\r\nfour years. But, when after the war he returned to Louisville, the quarry\r\nbegan again.\r\n\r\nHe was wont to call her \"Old Hell's Delight.\" Finally, one night, as he was\r\npassing the market, she rushed out and rained upon him blow after blow with\r\na frozen rabbit.\r\n\r\nThen the authorities took a hand. She was arraigned for disorderly conduct\r\nand brought before the Court of Police. Then the town, which knew nothing\r\nof the case and accepted her goings on as proof of wrong, rose; and she had\r\na veritable ovation, coming away with flying colors. This, however, served\r\nto satisfy her. Thenceforward she desisted and left poor John Throckmorton\r\nin peace.\r\n\r\nI knew her well. She used once in a while to come and see me, having some\r\nstory or other to tell. On one occasion I said to her: \"Ellen, why do you\r\npursue this man in this cruel way? What possible good can it do you?\" She\r\nlooked me straight in the eye and slowly replied: \"Because I love him.\"\r\n\r\nI investigated the case closely and thoroughly and was assured, as he had\r\nassured me, that he had never done her the slightest wrong. She had, on\r\noccasion, told me the same thing, and this I fully believed.\r\n\r\nHe was a man, every inch of him, and a gentleman through and through--the\r\nvery soul of honor in his transactions of every sort--most highly respected\r\nand esteemed wherever he was known--yet his life was made half a failure\r\nand wholly unhappy by this \"crazy Jane,\" the general public taking\r\nappearances for granted and willing to believe nothing good of one who,\r\nalbeit proud and honorable, held defiantly aloof, disdaining self-defense.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I have not known many men more unfortunate than John\r\nThrockmorton, who, but for \"Old Hell's Delight,\" would have encountered\r\nlittle obstacle to the pursuit of prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother interesting Kentuckian of this period was John Thompson Gray.\r\nHe was a Harvard man--a wit, a scholar, and, according to old Southern\r\nstandards, a chevalier. Handsome and gifted, he had the disastrous\r\nmisfortune just after leaving college to kill his friend in a duel--a\r\nmortal affair growing, as was usual in those days, out of a trivial\r\ncause--and this not only saddened his life, but, in its ambitious aims,\r\nshadowed and defeated it. His university comrades had fully counted on his\r\nmaking a great career. Being a man of fortune, he was able to live like\r\na gentleman without public preferment, and this he did, except to his\r\nfamiliars aloof and sensitive to the last.\r\n\r\nWilliam Preston, the whilom Minister to Spain and Confederate General, and\r\nDavid Yandell, the eminent surgeon, were his devoted friends, and a notable\r\ntrio they made. Stoddard Johnston, Boyd Winchester and I--very much younger\r\nmen--sat at their feet and immensely enjoyed their brilliant conversation.\r\n\r\nDr. Yandell was not only as proclaimed by Dr. Gross and Dr. Sayre the\r\nablest surgeon of his day, but he was also a gentleman of varied experience\r\nand great social distinction. He had studied long in Paris and was the pal\r\nof John Howard Payne, the familiar friend of Lamartine, Dumas and Lemaître.\r\nHe knew Béranger, Hugo and Balzac. It would be hard to find three\r\nKentuckians less provincial, more unaffected, scintillant and worldly wise\r\nthan he and William Preston and John Thompson Gray.\r\n\r\nIndeed the list of my acquaintances--many of them intimates--some of them\r\nfriends--would be, if recounted, a long one, not mentioning the foreigners,\r\nembracing a diverse company all the way from Chunkey Towles to Grover\r\nCleveland, from Wake Holman to John Pierpont Morgan, from John Chamberlin\r\nto Thomas Edison. I once served as honorary pall-bearer to a professional\r\ngambler who was given a public funeral; a man who had been a gallant\r\nConfederate soldier; whom nature intended for an artist, and circumstance\r\ndiverted into a sport; but who retained to the last the poetic fancy\r\nand the spirit of the gallant, leaving behind him, when he died, like a\r\nveritable cavalier, chiefly debts and friends. He was not a bad sort in\r\nbusiness, as the English say, nor in conviviality. But in fighting he was\r\n\"a dandy.\" The goody-goody philosophy of the namby-pamby takes an extreme\r\nand unreal view of life. It flies to extremes. There are middle men.\r\nTravers used to describe one of these, whom he did not wish particularly to\r\nemphasize, as \"a fairly clever son-of-a-gun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Twenty-Ninth\r\n\r\n    About Political Conventions, State and National--\"Old Ben Butler\"--His\r\n    Appearance as a Trouble-Maker in the Democratic National Convention of\r\n    1892--Tarifa and the Tariff--Spain as a Frightful Example\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had a liberal education in party convocations, State and national.\r\nIn those of 1860 I served as an all-around newspaper reporter. A member of\r\neach National Democratic Convention from 1876 to 1892, presiding over the\r\nfirst, and in those of 1880 and 1888 chosen chairman of the Resolutions\r\nCommittee, I wrote many of the platforms and had a decisive voice in all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 I had stood for the renomination of \"the Old Ticket,\" that is,\r\nTilden and Hendricks, making the eight-to-seven action of the Electoral\r\nTribunal of 1877 in favor of Hayes and Wheeler the paramount issue. It\r\nseems strange now that any one should have contested this. Yet it was\r\nstoutly contested. Mr. Tilden settled all dispute by sending a letter to\r\nthe convention declining to be a candidate. In answer to this I prepared a\r\nresolution of regret to be incorporated in the platform. It raised stubborn\r\nopposition. David A. Wells and Joseph Pulitzer, who were fellow members of\r\nthe committee, were with me in my contention, but the objection to making\r\nit a part of the platform grew so pronounced that they thought I had best\r\nnot insist upon it.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on and the latent opposition seemed to increase. I had been\r\nnamed chairman of the committee and had at a single sitting that morning\r\nwritten a completed platform. Each plank of this was severally and closely\r\nscrutinized. It was well into the afternoon before we reached the plank I\r\nchiefly cared about. When I read this the storm broke. Half the committee\r\nrose against it. At the close, with more heat than was either courteous or\r\ntactful, I said: \"Gentlemen, I wish to do no more than bid farewell to a\r\nleader who four years ago took the Democratic party at its lowest fortunes\r\nand made it a power again. He is well on his way to the grave. I would\r\nplace a wreath of flowers on that grave. I ask only this of you. Refuse me,\r\nand by God, I will go to that mob yonder and, dead or alive, nominate him,\r\nand you will be powerless to prevent!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barksdale, of Mississippi, a suave gentleman, who had led the\r\ndissenters, said, \"We do not refuse you. But you say that we 'regret' Mr.\r\nTilden's withdrawal. Now I do not regret it, nor do those who agree with\r\nme. Could you not substitute some other expression?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't stand on words,\" I answered. \"What would you suggest?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barksdale said: \"Would not the words 'We have received with the deepest\r\nsensibility Mr. Tilden's letter of withdrawal,' answer your purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said I, and the plank in the platform, as it was amended, was\r\nadopted unanimously.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden did not die. He outlived all his immediate rivals. Four years\r\nlater, in 1884, his party stood ready again to put him at its head.\r\nIn nominating Mr. Cleveland it thought it was accepting his dictation\r\nreënforced by the enormous majority--nearly 200,000--by which Mr.\r\nCleveland, as candidate for Governor, had carried New York in the preceding\r\nState election. Yet, when the votes in the presidential election came to be\r\ncounted, he carried it, if indeed he carried it at all, by less than 1,100\r\nmajority, the result hanging in the balance for nearly a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the convention of 1884, which met at Chicago, we had a veritable\r\nmonkey-and-parrot time. It was next after the schism in Congress between\r\nthe Democratic factions led respectively by Carlisle and Randall, Carlisle\r\nhaving been chosen Speaker of the House over Randall.\r\n\r\nConverse, of Ohio, appeared in the Platform Committee representing Randall,\r\nand Morrison, of Illinois, and myself, representing Carlisle. I was bent\r\nupon making Morrison chairman of the committee. But it was agreed that\r\nthe chairmanship should be held in abeyance until the platform had been\r\nformulated and adopted. The subcommittee to whom the task was delegated\r\nsat fifty-one hours without a break before its work was completed. Then\r\nMorrison was named chairman. It was arranged thereafter between Converse,\r\nMorrison and myself that when the agreed report was made, Converse and\r\nI should have each what time he required to say what was desired in\r\nexplanation, I to close the debate and move the previous question. At this\r\npoint General Butler sidled up. \"Where do I come in?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"You don't get in at all, you blasted old sinner,\" said Morrison.\r\n\r\n\"I have scriptural warrant,\" General Butler said. \"Thou shalt not muzzle\r\nthe ox that treadeth the corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, old man,\" said Morrison, good-humoredly, \"take all the time you\r\nwant.\"\r\n\r\nIn his speech before the convention General Butler was not at his happiest,\r\nand in closing he gave me a particularly good opening. \"If you adopt this\r\nplatform of my friend Watterson,\" he said, \"God may help you, but I can't.\"\r\n\r\nI was standing by his side, and, it being my turn, he made way for me, and\r\nI said: \"During the last few days and nights of agreeable, though rather\r\nirksome, intercourse, I have learned to love General Butler, but I must\r\ndeclare that in an option between him and the Almighty I have a prejudice\r\nin favor of God.\"\r\n\r\nIn his personal intercourse, General Butler was the most genial of men. The\r\nsubcommittee in charge of the preparation of a platform held its meetings\r\nin the drawing-room of his hotel apartment, and he had constituted himself\r\nour host as well as our colleague. I had not previously met him. It was\r\nnot long after we came together before he began to call me by my Christian\r\nname. At one stage of the proceedings when by substituting one word for\r\nanother it looked as though we might reach an agreement, he said to me:\r\n\"Henry, what is the difference between 'exclusively for public purposes'\r\nand 'a tariff for revenue only'?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of none,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that the committee have found you out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I scarcely think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will see that they do,\" and he proceeded in his peculiarly subtle\r\nway to undo all that we had done, prolonging the session twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nHe was an able man and a lovable man. The missing ingredient was serious\r\nbelief. Just after the nomination of the Breckinridge and Lane Presidential\r\nticket in 1860, I heard him make an ultra-Southern speech from Mr.\r\nBreckinridge's doorway. \"What do you think of that?\" I asked Andrew\r\nJohnson, who stood by me, and Johnson answered sharply, with an oath: \"I\r\nnever like a man to be for me more than I am for myself.\" I have been told\r\nthat even at home General Butler could never acquire the public confidence.\r\nIn spite of his conceded mentality and manliness he gave the impression of\r\nbeing something of an intellectual sharper.\r\n\r\nHe was charitable, generous and amiable. The famous New Orleans order which\r\nhad made him odious to the women of the South he had issued to warn\r\nbad women and protect good women. Assuredly he did not foresee the\r\ninterpretation that would be put upon it. He was personally popular in\r\nCongress. When he came to Washington he dispensed a lavish hospitality.\r\nSuch radical Democrats as Beck and Knott did not disdain his company,\r\nbecame, indeed, his familiars. Yet, curious to relate, a Kentucky\r\nCongressman of the period lost his seat because it was charged and proven\r\nthat he had ridden in a carriage to the White House with the Yankee\r\nBoanerges on a public occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMere party issues never counted with me. I have read too much and seen too\r\nmuch. At my present time of life they count not at all. I used to think\r\nthat there was a principle involved between the dogmas of Free Trade and\r\nProtection as they were preached by their respective attorneys. Yet what\r\nwas either except the ancient, everlasting scheme--\r\n\r\n  --\"_The good old rôle--the simple plan,\r\n  That they should take who have the power\r\n  And they should keep who can_.\"\r\n\r\nHow little wisdom one man may get from another man's counsels, one nation\r\nmay get from another nation's history, can be partly computed when we\r\nreflect how often our personal experience has failed in warning admonition.\r\n\r\nTemperament and circumstance do indeed cut a prodigious figure in life.\r\nTraversing the older countries, especially Spain, the most illustrative,\r\nthe wayfarer is met at all points by what seems not merely the logic of\r\nevents, but the common law of the inevitable. The Latin of the Sixteenth\r\ncentury was a recrudescence of the Roman of the First. He had not, like the\r\nMongolian, lived long enough to become a stoic. He was mainly a cynic and\r\nan adventurer. Thence he flowered into a sybarite. Coming to great wealth\r\nwith the discoveries of Columbus and the conquests of Pizarro and Cortes,\r\nhe proceeded to enjoy its fruits according to his fancy and the fashion of\r\nthe times.\r\n\r\nHe erected massive shrines to his deities. He reared noble palaces. He\r\nbuilt about his cathedrals and his castles what were then thought to be\r\ngreat cities, walled and fortified. He was, for all his self-sufficiency\r\nand pride, short-sighted; and yet, until they arrived, how could he foresee\r\nthe developments of artillery? They were as hidden from him as three\r\ncenturies later the wonders of electricity were hidden from us.\r\n\r\nI was never a Free Trader. I stood for a tariff for revenue as the least\r\noppressive and safest support of Government. The protective system in the\r\nUnited States, responsible for our unequal distribution of wealth, took at\r\nleast its name from Spain, and the Robber Barons, as I used to call the\r\nProtectionists of Pennsylvania, were not of immediate German origin.\r\n\r\nTruth to say, both on land and water Spain has made a deal of history, and\r\nthe front betwixt Gibraltar and the Isle of San Fernando--Tangier on one\r\nside and the Straits of Tarifa on the other--Cape Trafalgar, where Nelson\r\nfought the famous battle, midway between them--has had its share.\r\n\r\nTarifa! What memories it invokes! In the olden and golden days of primitive\r\nman, before corporation lawyers had learned how to frame pillaging\r\nstatutes, and rascally politicians to bamboozle confiding\r\nconstituencies--thus I used to put it--the gentle pirates of Tarifa laid\r\nbroad and deep the foundations for the Protective System in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt was a fruitful as well as a congenial theme, and I rang all the changes\r\non it. To take by law from one man what is his and give it to another man\r\nwho has not earned it and has no right to it, I showed to be an invention\r\nof the Moors, copied by the Spaniards and elevated thence into political\r\neconomy by the Americans. Tarifa took its name from Tarif-Ben-Malik, the\r\nmost enterprising Robber Baron of his day, and thus the Lords of Tarifa\r\nwere the progenitors of the Robber Barons of the Black Forest, New England\r\nand Pittsburgh. Tribute was the name the Moors gave their robbery, which\r\nwas open and aboveboard. The Coal Kings, the Steel Kings and the Oil Kings\r\nof the modern world have contrived to hide the process; but in Spain the\r\npalaces of their forefathers rise in lonely and solemn grandeur just as a\r\nthousand years hence the palaces upon the Fifth Avenue side of Central Park\r\nand along Riverside Drive, not to mention those of the Schuylkill and the\r\nDelaware, may become but roosts for bats and owls, and the chronicler of\r\nthe Anthropophagi, \"whose heads do reach the skies,\" may tell how the\r\nvoters of the Great Republic were bought and sold with their own money,\r\nuntil \"Heaven released the legions north of the North Pole, and they\r\nswooped down and crushed the pulpy mass beneath their avenging snowshoes.\"\r\n\r\nThe gold that was gathered by the Spaniards and fought over so valiantly\r\nis scattered to the four ends of the earth. It may be as potent to-day as\r\nthen; but it does not seem nearly so heroic. A good deal of it has found\r\nits way to London, which a short century and a half ago \"had not,\"\r\naccording to Adam Smith, \"sufficient wealth to compete with Cadiz.\" We have\r\nhad our full share without fighting for it. Thus all things come to him who\r\ncontrives and waits.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there are \"groups\" and \"rings.\" And, likewise, \"leaders\" and\r\n\"bosses.\" What do they know or care about the origins of wealth; about\r\nVenice; about Cadiz; about what is said of Wall Street? The Spanish Main\r\nwas long ago stripped of its pillage. The buccaneers took themselves off to\r\nkeep company with the Vikings. Yet, away down in those money chests, once\r\nfilled with what were pieces of eight and ducats and doubloons, who shall\r\nsay that spirits may not lurk and ghosts walk, one old freebooter wheezing\r\nto another old freebooter: \"They order these things better in the\r\n'States.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed hugely my several sojourns in Spain. The Spaniard is unlike\r\nany other European. He may not make you love him. But you are bound to\r\nrespect him.\r\n\r\nThere is a mansion in Seville known as The House of Pontius Pilate because\r\npart of the remains of the abode of the Roman Governor was brought from\r\nJerusalem and used in a building suited to the dignity of a Spanish grandee\r\nwho was also a Lord of Tarifa. The Duke of Medina Celi, its present owner,\r\nis a lineal scion of the old piratical crew. The mansion is filled with the\r\nfruits of many a foray. There are plunder from Naples, where one ancestor\r\nwas Viceroy, and treasures from the temples of the Aztecs and the Incas,\r\nwhere two other ancestors ruled. Every coping stone and pillar cost some\r\nmariner of the Tarifa Straits a pot of money.\r\n\r\nIts owner is a pauper. A carekeeper shows it for a peseta a head. To such\r\nbase uses may we come at last. Yet Seville basks in the sun and smiles on\r\nthe flashing waters of the Guadalquivir, and Cadiz sits serene upon the\r\ngreen hillsides of San Sebastian, just as if nothing had ever happened;\r\nneither the Barber and Carmen, nor Nelson and Byron; the past but a\r\nphantom; the present the prosiest of prose-poems.\r\n\r\nThere are canny Spaniards even as there are canny Scots, who grow rich and\r\nprosper; but there is never a Spaniard who does not regard the political\r\nfabric, and the laws, as fair game, the rule being always \"devil take the\r\nhindmost,\" community of interests nowhere. \"The good old vices of Spain,\"\r\nthat is, the robbing of the lesser rogue by the greater in regulated\r\ngradations all the way from the King to the beggar, are as prevalent and as\r\nvital as ever they were. Curiously enough, a tiny stream of Hebraic blood\r\nand Moorish blood still trickles through the Spanish coast towns. It may be\r\ntraced through the nomenclature in spite of its Castilian prefigurations\r\nand appendices, which would account for some of the enterprise and activity\r\nthat show themselves, albeit only by fits and starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirtieth\r\n\r\n    The Makers of the Republic--Lincoln, Jefferson, Clay and Webster--The\r\n    Proposed League of Nations--The Wilsonian Incertitude--The \"New\r\n    Freedom\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe makers of the American Republic range themselves in two\r\ngroups--Washington, Franklin and Jefferson--Clay, Webster and Lincoln--each\r\nof whom, having a genius peculiarly his own, gave himself and his best to\r\nthe cause of national unity and independence.\r\n\r\nIn a general way it may be said that Washington created and Lincoln saved\r\nthe Union. But along with Washington and Lincoln, Clay makes a good\r\nhistoric third, for it was the masterful Kentuckian who, joining rare\r\nforesight to surpassing eloquence and leading many eminent men, including\r\nWebster, was able to hold the legions of unrest at bay during the formative\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThere are those who call these great men \"back numbers,\" who tell us we\r\nhave left the past behind us and entered an epoch of more enlightened\r\nprogress--who would displace the example of the simple lives they led and\r\nthe homely truths they told, to set up a school of philosophy which had\r\nmade Athens stare and Rome howl, and, I dare say, is causing the Old\r\nContinentals to turn over in their graves. The self-exploiting spectacle\r\nand bizarre teaching of this school passes the wit of man to fathom.\r\nProfessing the ideal and proposing to recreate the Universe, the New\r\nFreedom, as it calls itself, would standardize it. The effect of that would\r\nbe to desiccate the human species in human conceit. It would cheapen the\r\nvery harps and halos in Heaven and convert the Day of Judgment into a\r\nmoving picture show.\r\n\r\nI protest that I am not of its kidney. In point of fact, its platitudes\r\n\"stick in my gizzard.\" I belong the rather to those old-fashioned ones--\r\n\r\n  \"Who love their land because it is their own,\r\n  And scorn to give aught other reason why;\r\n  Who'd shake hands with a king upon his throne,\r\n  And think it kindness to his majesty.\"\r\n\r\nI have many rights--birthrights--to speak of Kentucky as a Kentuckian,\r\nbeside that of more than fifty years' service upon what may be fairly\r\ncalled the battle-line of the Dark and Bloody Ground.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother's father, William Mitchell Morrison, had raised a company\r\nof riflemen in the War of the Revolution, and, after the War, marched it\r\nwestward. He commanded the troops in the old fort at Harrodsburg, where\r\nmy grandmother was born in 1784. He died a general. My grandfather,\r\nJames Black's father, the Rev. James Black, was chaplain of the fort. He\r\nremembered the birth of the baby girl who was to become his wife. He was a\r\nnoble stalwart--a perfect type of the hunters of Kentucky--who could bring\r\ndown a squirrel from the highest bough and hit a bull's eye at a hundred\r\nyards after he was three score and ten.\r\n\r\nIt was he who delighted my childhood with bear stories and properly lurid\r\nnarrations of the braves in buckskin and the bucks in paint and feathers,\r\nwith now and then a red-coat to give pungency and variety to the tale. He\r\nwould sing me to sleep with hunting songs. He would take me with him afield\r\nto carry the game bag, and I was the only one of many grandchildren to be\r\nnamed in his will. In my thoughts and in my dreams he has been with me all\r\nmy life, a memory and an example, and an ever glorious inspiration.\r\n\r\nDaniel Boone and Simon Kenton were among my earliest heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in a Democratic camp, and growing to manhood on the Democratic side of\r\na political battlefield, I did not accept, as I came later to realize, the\r\ntranscendent personal merit and public service of Henry Clay. Being of\r\nTennessee parentage, perhaps the figure of Andrew Jackson came between;\r\nperhaps the rhetoric of Daniel Webster. Once hearing me make some slighting\r\nremark of the Great Commoner, my father, a life-long Democrat, who, on\r\nopposing sides, had served in Congress with Mr. Clay, gently rebuked me.\r\n\"Do not express such opinions, my son,\" he said, \"they discredit yourself.\r\nMr. Clay was a very great man--a born leader of men.\"\r\n\r\nIt was certainly he, more than any other man, who held the Union together\r\nuntil the time arrived for Lincoln to save it.\r\n\r\nI made no such mistake, however, with respect to Abraham Lincoln. From the\r\nfirst he appeared to me a great man, a born leader of men. His death proved\r\na blow to the whole country--most of all to the Southern section of it.\r\nIf he had lived there would have been no Era of Reconstruction, with its\r\nrepressive agencies and oppressive legislation; there would have been\r\nwanting to the extremism of the time the bloody cue of his taking off to\r\nmount the steeds and spur the flanks of vengeance. For Lincoln entertained,\r\nwith respect to the rehabilitation of the Union, the single wish that the\r\nSouthern States--to use his homely phraseology--\"should come back home\r\nand behave themselves,\" and if he had lived he would have made this wish\r\neffectual as he made everything else effectual to which he addressed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHis was the genius of common sense. Of perfect intellectual acuteness and\r\naplomb, he sprang from a Virginia pedigree and was born in Kentucky.\r\nHe knew all about the South, its institutions, its traditions and its\r\npeculiarities. He was an old-line Whig of the school of Henry Clay, with\r\nstrong Emancipation leaning, never an Abolitionist. \"If slavery be not\r\nwrong,\" he said, \"nothing is wrong,\" but he also said and reiterated it\r\ntime and again, \"I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are\r\njust what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist\r\namong them they would not introduce it. If it did now exist among us, we\r\nwould not instantly give it up.\"\r\n\r\nFrom first to last throughout the angry debates preceding the War of\r\nSections, amid the passions of the War itself, not one vindictive,\r\nprescriptive word fell from his tongue or pen, whilst during its progress\r\nthere was scarcely a day when he did not project his great personality\r\nbetween some Southern man or woman and danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion about what did and what did not occur at the\r\nfamous Hampton Roads Conference. That Mr. Lincoln met and conferred with\r\nthe official representatives of the Confederate Government, led by the Vice\r\nPresident of the Confederate States, when it must have been known to him\r\nthat the Confederacy was nearing the end of its resources, is sufficient\r\nproof of the breadth both of his humanity and his patriotism. Yet he went\r\nto Fortress Monroe prepared not only to make whatever concessions toward\r\nthe restoration of Union and Peace he had the lawful authority to make,\r\nbut to offer some concessions which could in the nature of the case go no\r\nfurther at that time than his personal assurance. His constitutional powers\r\nwere limited. But he was in himself the embodiment of great moral power.\r\n\r\nThe story that he offered payment for the slaves--so often affirmed and\r\ndenied--is in either case but a quibble with the actual facts. He could not\r\nhave made such an offer except tentatively, lacking the means to carry it\r\nout. He was not given the opportunity to make it, because the Confederate\r\nCommissioners were under instructions to treat solely on the basis of the\r\nrecognition of the independence of the Confederacy. The conference came to\r\nnought. It ended where it began. But there is ample evidence that he went\r\nto Hampton Roads resolved to commit himself to that proposition. He did,\r\naccording to the official reports, refer to it in specific terms, having\r\nalready formulated a plan of procedure. This plan exists and may be seen in\r\nhis own handwriting. It embraced a joint resolution to be submitted by the\r\nPresident to the two Houses of Congress appropriating $400,000,000 to be\r\ndistributed among the Southern States on the basis of the slave population\r\nof each according to the Census of 1860, and a proclamation to be issued\r\nby himself, as President, when the joint resolution had been passed by\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThere can be no controversy among honest students of history on this point.\r\nThat Mr. Lincoln said to Mr. Stephens, \"Let me write Union at the top\r\nof this page and you may write below it whatever else you please,\" is\r\nreferable to Mr. Stephens' statement made to many friends and attested by a\r\nnumber of reliable persons. But that he meditated the most liberal terms,\r\nincluding payment for the slaves, rests neither upon conjecture nor\r\nhearsay, but on documentary proof. It may be argued that he could not\r\nhave secured the adoption of any such plan; but of his purpose, and\r\nits genuineness, there can be no question and there ought to be no\r\nequivocation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, payment for the slaves had been all along in his mind. He believed\r\nthe North equally guilty with the South for the original existence of\r\nslavery. He clearly understood that the Irrepressible Conflict was a\r\nConflict of systems, not a merely sectional and partisan quarrel. He was a\r\njust man, abhorring proscription: an old Conscience Whig, indeed, who stood\r\nin awe of the Constitution and his oath of office. He wanted to leave the\r\nSouth no right to claim that the North, finding slave labor unremunerative,\r\nhad sold its negroes to the South and then turned about and by force of\r\narms confiscated what it had unloaded at a profit. He fully recognized\r\nslavery as property. The Proclamation of Emancipation was issued as a war\r\nmeasure. In his message to Congress of December, 1862, he proposed payment\r\nfor the slaves, elaborating a scheme in detail and urging it with copious\r\nand cogent argument. \"The people of the South,\" said he, addressing a\r\nCongress at that moment in the throes of a bloody war with the South, \"are\r\nnot more responsible for the original introduction of this property than\r\nare the people of the North, and, when it is remembered how unhesitatingly\r\nwe all use cotton and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them, it\r\nmay not be quite safe to say that the South has been more responsible than\r\nthe North for its continuance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been my rule, aim and effort in my newspaper career to print nothing\r\nof a man which I would not say to his face; to print nothing of a man in\r\nmalice; to look well and think twice before consigning a suspect to the\r\nruin of printer's ink; to respect the old and defend the weak; and, lastly,\r\nat work and at play, daytime and nighttime, to be good to the girls and\r\nsquare with the boys, for hath it not been written of such is the kingdom\r\nof Heaven?\r\n\r\nThere will always be in a democracy two or more sets of rival leaders to\r\ntwo or more differing groups of followers. Hitherto history has classified\r\nthese as conservatives and radicals. But as society has become more and\r\nmore complex the groups have had their subdivisions. As a consequence\r\nspeculative doctrinaries and adventurous politicians are enabled to get in\r\ntheir work of confusing the issues and exploiting themselves.\r\n\r\n\"'What are these fireworks for?' asks the rustic in the parable. 'To blind\r\nthe eyes of the people,' answers the cynic.\"\r\n\r\nI would not say aught in a spirit of hostility to the President of the\r\nUnited States. Woodrow Wilson is a clever speaker and writer. Yet the usual\r\ntrend and phrase of his observations seem to be those of a special pleader,\r\nrather than those of a statesman. Every man, each of the nations, is for\r\npeace as an abstract proposition. That much goes without saying. But Mr.\r\nWilson proposes to bind the hands of a giant and take lottery chances on\r\nthe future. This, I think, the country will contest.\r\n\r\nHe is obsessed by the idea of a League of Nations. If not his own discovery\r\nhe has yet made himself its leader. He talks flippantly about \"American\r\nideals\" that have won the war against Germany, as if there were no English\r\nideals and French ideals.\r\n\r\n\"In all that he does we can descry the school-master who arrived at the\r\nfront rather late in life. One needs only to go over the record and\r\nmark how often he has reversed himself to detect a certain mental and\r\ntemperamental instability clearly indicating a lack of fixed or resolute\r\nintellectual purpose. This is characteristic of an excess in education; of\r\nthe half baked mind overtrained. The overeducated mind fancies himself a\r\ndoctrinaire when he is in point of fact only a disciple.\"\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson was born to the rather sophisticated culture of the too, too\r\nsolid South. Had he grown up in England a hundred years ago he would have\r\nbeen a follower of the Della Cruscans. He has what is called a facile pen,\r\nthough it sometimes runs away with him. It seems to have done so in the\r\nmatter of the League of Nations. Inevitably such a scheme would catch the\r\nfancy of one ever on the alert for the fanciful.\r\n\r\nI cannot too often repeat that the world we inhabit is a world of sin,\r\ndisease and death. Men will fight whenever they want to fight, and no\r\nartificial scheme or process is likely to restrain them. It is mainly the\r\ncostliness of war that makes most against it. But, as we have seen the last\r\nfour years, it will not quell the passions of men or dull national and\r\nracial ambitions.\r\n\r\nAll that Mr. Wilson and his proposed League of Nations can do will be to\r\nrevamp, and maybe for a while to reimpress the minds of the rank and file,\r\nuntil the bellowing followers of Bellona are ready to spring.\r\n\r\nEternal peace, universal peace, was not the purpose of the Deity in the\r\ncreation of the universe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would seem to be the duty of men in great place, as of\r\nus all, to proclaim the gospel of good will and cultivate the arts of\r\nfraternity. I have no quarrel with the President on this score. What I\r\ncontest is the self-exploitation to which he is prone, so lacking in\r\ndignity and open to animadversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it was that instant upon the appearance of the proposed League of\r\nNations I made bold to challenge it, as but a pretty conceit having no real\r\nvalue, a serious assault upon our national sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIts argument seemed to me full of copybook maxims, easier recited than\r\napplied. As what I wrote preceded the debates and events of the last six\r\nmonths, I may not improperly make the following quotation from a screed of\r\nmine appearing in The Courier-Journal of the 5th of March, 1919:\r\n\r\n\"The League of Nations is a fad. Politics, like society and letters, has\r\nits fads. In society they call them fashion and in literature originality.\r\nPolitics gives the name of 'issues' to its fads. A taking issue is as a\r\nstunning gown, or 'a best seller.' The President's mind wears a coat of\r\nmany colors, and he can change it at will, his mood being the objective\r\npoint, not always too far ahead, or clear of vision. Carl Schurz was wont\r\nto speak of Gratz Brown as 'a man of thoughts rather than of ideas.' I\r\nwonder if that can be justly said of the President? 'Gentlemen will please\r\nnot shoot at the pianiste,' adjured the superscription over the music stand\r\nin the Dakota dive; 'she is doing the best that she knows how.'\r\n\r\n\"Already it is being proclaimed that Woodrow Wilson can have a third\r\nnomination for the presidency if he wants it, and nobody seems shocked by\r\nit, which proves that the people grow degenerate and foreshadows that one\r\nof these nights some fool with a spyglass will break into Mars and let\r\nloose the myriads of warlike gyascutes who inhabit that freak luminary,\r\nthence to slide down the willing moonbeam and swallow us every one!\r\n\r\n\"In a sense the Monroe Doctrine was a fad. Oblivious to Canada, and British\r\nColumbia and the Spanish provinces, it warned the despots of Europe off the\r\ngrass in America. We actually went to war with Mexico, having enjoyed two\r\nwars with England, and again and again we threatened to annex the Dominion.\r\nEverything betwixt hell and Halifax was Yankee preëmpted.\r\n\r\n\"Truth to say, your Uncle Samuel was ever a jingo. But your Cousin Woodrow,\r\nenlarging on the original plan, would stretch our spiritual boundaries to\r\nthe ends of the earth and make of us the moral custodian of the universe.\r\nThis much, no less, he got of the school of sweetness and light in which he\r\ngrew up.\r\n\r\n\"I am a jingo myself. But a wicked material jingo, who wants facts, not\r\ntheories. If I thought it possible and that it would pay, I would annex the\r\nNorth Pole and colonize the Equator. It is, after the manner of the lady in\r\nthe play, that the President 'doth protest too much,' which displeases me\r\nand where, in point of fact, I 'get off the reservation.'\r\n\r\n\"That, being a politician and maybe a candidate, he is keenly alive to\r\nvotes goes without saying. On the surface this League of Nations having the\r\nword 'peace' in big letters emblazoned both upon its forehead and the\r\nseat of its trousers--or, should I say, woven into the hem of its\r\npetticoat?--seems an appeal for votes. I do not believe it will bear\r\ndiscussion. In a way, it tickles the ear without convincing the sense.\r\nThere is nothing sentimental about the actualities of Government, much\r\nas public men seek to profit by arousing the passions of the people.\r\nGovernment is a hard and fast and dry reality. At best statesmanship can\r\nonly half do the things it would. Its aims are most assured when tending a\r\nlittle landward; its footing safest on its native heath. We have plenty\r\nto do on our own continent without seeking to right things on\r\nother continents. Too many of us--the President among the rest, I\r\nfear--miscalculate the distance between contingency and desire.\r\n\r\n  \"'We figure to ourselves\r\n  The thing we like: and then we build it up:\r\n  As chance will have it on the rock or sand--\r\n  When thought grows tired of wandering o'er the world,\r\n  And homebound Fancy runs her bark ashore.'\"\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see the New York World fly off at a tangent about this latest\r\nof the Wilsonian hobbies. Frank Irving Cobb, the editor of the World, is,\r\nas I have often said, the strongest writer on the New York press since\r\nHorace Greeley. But he can hardly be called a sentimentalist, as Greeley\r\nwas, and there is nothing but sentiment--gush and gammon--in the proposed\r\nLeague of Nations.\r\n\r\nIt may be all right for England. There are certainly no flies on it for\r\nFrance. But we don't need it. Its effects can only be to tie our hands, not\r\nkeep the dogs away, and even at the worst, in stress of weather, we are\r\nstrong enough to keep the dogs away ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe should say to Europe: \"Shinny on your own side of the water and we will\r\nshinny on our side.\" It may be that Napoleon's opinion will come true that\r\nultimately Europe will be \"all Cossack or all republican.\" Part of it has\r\ncome true already. Meanwhile it looks as though the United States, having\r\nexhausted the reasonable possibilities of democracy, is beginning to turn\r\ncrank. Look at woman suffrage by Federal edict; look at prohibition by\r\nact of Congress and constitutional amendment; tobacco next to walk on the\r\nplank; and then!--Lord, how glad I feel that I am nearly a hundred years\r\nold and shall not live to see it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-First\r\n\r\n    The Age of Miracles--A Story of Franklin Pierce--Simon Suggs\r\n    Billy Sunday--Jefferson Davis and Aaron Burr--Certain Constitutional\r\n    Shortcomings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years intervening between 1865 and 1919 may be accounted the most\r\nmomentous in all the cycles of the ages. The bells that something more than\r\nhalf a century ago rang forth to welcome peace in America have been from\r\nthat day to this jangled out of tune and harsh with the sounding of war's\r\nalarms in every other part of the world. We flatter ourselves with the\r\nthought that our tragedy lies behind us. Whether this be true or not, the\r\ntragedy of Europe is at hand and ahead. The miracles of modern invention,\r\nsurpassing those of old, have made for strife, not for peace. Civilization\r\nhas gone backward, not forward. Rulers, intoxicated by the lust of power\r\nand conquest, have lost their reason, and nations, following after, like\r\ncattle led to slaughter, seem as the bereft of Heaven \"that knew not God.\"\r\n\r\nWe read the story of our yesterdays as it unfolds itself in the current\r\nchronicle; the ascent to the bank-house, the descent to the mad-house, and,\r\nover the glittering paraphernalia that follows to the tomb, we reflect upon\r\nthe money-zealot's progress; the dizzy height, the dazzling array, the\r\ncraze for more and more and more; then the temptation and fall, millions\r\ngone, honor gone, reason gone--the innocent and the gentle, with the\r\nguilty, dragged through the mire of the prison, and the court--and we draw\r\nback aghast. Yet, if we speak of these things we are called pessimists.\r\n\r\nI have always counted myself an optimist. I know that I do not lie awake\r\nnights musing on the ingratitude either of my stars or my countrymen. I\r\npity the man who does. Looking backward, I have sincere compassion for\r\nWebster and for Clay! What boots it to them, now that they lie beneath the\r\nmold, and that the drums and tramplings of nearly seventy years of the\r\nworld's strifes and follies and sordid ambitions and mean repinings, and\r\nlongings, and laughter, and tears, have passed over their graves, what\r\nboots it to them, now, that they failed to get all they wanted? There is\r\nindeed snug lying in the churchyard; but the flowers smell as sweet and\r\nthe birds sing as merry, and the stars look down as loving upon the\r\nGod-hallowed mounds of the lowly and the poor, as upon the man-bedecked\r\nmonuments of the Kings of men. All of us, the least with the greatest, let\r\nus hope and believe shall attain immortal life at last. What was there for\r\nWebster, what was there for Clay to quibble about? I read with a kind of\r\nwonder, and a sickening sense of the littleness of great things, those\r\npassages in the story of their lives where it is told how they stormed\r\nand swore, when tidings reached them that they had been balked of their\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nYet they might have been so happy; so happy in their daily toil, with its\r\nlofty aims and fair surroundings; so happy in the sense of duty done;\r\nso happy, above all, in their own Heaven-sent genius, with its noble\r\nopportunities and splendid achievements. They should have emulated the\r\nsatisfaction told of Franklin Pierce. It is related that an enemy was\r\ninveighing against him, when an alleged friend spoke up and said: \"You\r\nshould not talk so about the President, I assure you that he is not at all\r\nthe man you describe him to be. On the contrary, he is a man of the rarest\r\ngifts and virtues. He has long been regarded as the greatest orator in New\r\nEngland, and the greatest lawyer in New England, and surely no one of his\r\npredecessors ever sent such state papers to Congress.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to prove it,\" angrily retorted the first speaker.\r\n\r\n\"I don't need to prove it,\" coolly replied the second. \"He admits it.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot tell just how I should feel if I were President, though, on the\r\nwhole, I fancy fairly comfortable, but I am quite certain that I would not\r\nexchange places with any of the men who have been President, and I have\r\nknown quite a number of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nI am myself accused sometimes of being a \"pessimist.\" Assuredly I am\r\nno optimist of the Billy Sunday sort, who fancies the adoption of the\r\nprohibition amendment the coming of \"de jubilo.\" Early in life, while yet\r\na recognized baseball authority, Mr. Sunday discovered \"pay dirt\" in what\r\nCol. Mulberry Sellers called \"piousness.\" He made it an asset and began\r\nto issue celestial notes, countersigned by himself and made redeemable\r\nin Heaven. From that day to this he has been following the lead of the\r\nrenowned Simon Suggs, who, having in true camp meeting style acquired\r\n\"the grace of God,\" turned loose as an exhorter shouting \"Step up to the\r\nmourner's bench, my brethering, step up lively, and be saved! I come in on\r\nna 'er par, an' see what I draw'd! Religion's the only game whar you can't\r\nlose. Him that trusts the Lord holds fo' aces!\"\r\n\r\nThe Billy Sunday game has made Billy Sunday rich. Having exhausted\r\nHell-fire-and-brimstone, the evangel turns to the Demon Rum. Satan, with\r\nhide and horns, has had his day. Prohibition is now the trick card.\r\n\r\nThe fanatic is never either very discriminating or very particular. As\r\na rule, for him any taking \"ism\" will suffice. To-day, it happens to be\r\n\"whisky.\" To-morrow it will be tobacco. Finally, having established the spy\r\nsystem and made house-to-house espionage a rule of conventicle, it will\r\nbecome a misdemeanor for a man to kiss his wife.\r\n\r\nFrom fakers who have cards up their sleeves, not to mention snakes in their\r\nboots, we hear a great deal about \"the people,\" pronounced by them as if it\r\nwere spelled \"pee-pul.\" It is the unfailing recourse of the professional\r\npolitician in quest of place. Yet scarcely any reference, or referee, were\r\nfaultier.\r\n\r\nThe people en masse constitute what we call the mob. Mobs have rarely been\r\nright--never except when capably led. It was the mob of Jerusalem that did\r\nthe unoffending Jesus of Nazareth to death. It was the mob in Paris that\r\nmade the Reign of Terror. Mobs have seldom been tempted, even had a chance\r\nto go wrong, that they have not gone wrong.\r\n\r\nThe \"people\" is a fetish. It was the people, misled, who precipitated the\r\nSouth into the madness of secession and the ruin of a hopelessly unequal\r\nwar of sections. It was the people backing if not compelling the Kaiser,\r\nwho committed hari-kari for themselves and their empire in Germany. It is\r\nthe people leaderless who are making havoc in Russia. Throughout the length\r\nand breadth of Christendom, in all lands and ages, the people, when turned\r\nloose, have raised every inch of hell to the square foot they were able to\r\nraise, often upon the slightest pretext, or no pretext at all.\r\n\r\nThis is merely to note the mortal fallibility of man, most fallible when\r\nherded in groups and prone to do in the aggregate what he would hesitate to\r\ndo when left to himself and his individual accountability.\r\n\r\nUnder a wise dispensation of power, despotism, we are told embodies the\r\nbest of all government. The trouble is that despotism is seldom, if ever,\r\nwise. It is its nature to be inconsiderate, being essentially selfish,\r\ngrasping and tyrannous. As a rule therefore revolution--usually of\r\nforce--has been required to change or reform it. Perfectibility was not\r\ndesigned for mortal man. That indeed furnishes the strongest argument in\r\nfavor of the immortality of the soul, life on earth but the ante-chamber of\r\neternal life. It would be a cruel Deity that condemned man to the brief and\r\nvexed span of human existence with nothing beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nWe know not whence we came, or whither we go; but it is a fair guess that\r\nwe shall in the end get better than we have known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHistoric democracy is dead.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that a Democratic party organization has ceased to\r\nexist. Nor does it mean that there are no more Democrats and that the\r\nDemocratic party is dead in the sense that the Federalist party is dead or\r\nthe Whig party is dead, or the Greenback party is dead, or the Populist\r\nparty is dead. That which has died is the Democratic party of Jefferson and\r\nJackson and Tilden. The principles of government which they laid down\r\nand advocated have been for the most part obliterated. What slavery and\r\nsecession were unable to accomplish has been brought about by nationalizing\r\nsumptuary laws and suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe death-blow to Jeffersonian democracy was delivered by the Democratic\r\nSenators and Representatives from the South and West who carried through\r\nthe prohibition amendment. The _coup de grâce_ was administered by a\r\nPresident of the United States elected as a Democrat when he approved the\r\nFederal suffrage amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe kind of government for which the Jeffersonian democracy successfully\r\nbattled for more than a century was thus repudiated; centralization was\r\ninvited; State rights were assassinated in the very citadel of State\r\nrights. The charter of local self-government become a scrap of paper, the\r\nway is open for the obliteration of the States in all their essential\r\nfunctions and the erection of a Federal Government more powerful than\r\nanything of which Alexander Hamilton dared to dream.\r\n\r\nWhen the history of these times comes to be written it may be said of\r\nWoodrow Wilson: he rose to world celebrity by circumstance rather than by\r\ncharacter. He was favored of the gods. He possessed a bright, forceful\r\nmind. His achievements were thrust upon him. Though it sometimes ran away\r\nwith him, his pen possessed extraordinary facility. Thus he was ever able\r\nto put his best foot foremost. Never in the larger sense a leader of men as\r\nwere Chatham and Fox, as were Washington, Clay and Lincoln; nor of ideas as\r\nwere Rousseau, Voltaire and Franklin, he had the subtle tenacity of Louis\r\nthe Eleventh of France, the keen foresight of Richelieu with a talent for\r\nthe surprising which would have raised him to eminence in journalism.\r\nIn short he was an opportunist void of conviction and indifferent to\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe pen is mightier than the sword only when it has behind it a heart as\r\nwell as a brain. He who wields it must be brave, upright and steadfast.\r\nWe are giving our Chief Executive enormous powers. As a rule his wishes\r\nprevail. His name becomes the symbol of party loyalty. Yet it is after all\r\na figure of speech not a personality that appeals to our sense of duty\r\nwithout necessarily engaging our affection.\r\n\r\nHistoric Republicanism is likewise dead, as dead as historic Democracy,\r\nonly in both cases the labels surviving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told by Herbert Spencer that the political superstition of the past\r\nhaving been the divine right of kings, the political superstition of the\r\npresent is the divine right of parliaments and he might have said of\r\npeoples. The oil of anointing seems unawares, he thinks, to have dripped\r\nfrom the head of the one upon the heads of the many, and given sacredness\r\nto them also, and to their decrees.\r\n\r\nThat the Proletariat, the Bolsheviki, the People are on the way seems plain\r\nenough. How far they will go, and where they will end, is not so clear.\r\nWith a kind of education--most men taught to read, very few to think--the\r\nmasses are likely to demand yet more and more for themselves. They will\r\ncontinue strenuously and effectively to resent the startling contrasts\r\nof fortune which aptitude and opportunity have created in a social and\r\npolitical structure claiming to rest upon the formula \"equality for all,\r\nspecial privilege for none.\"\r\n\r\nThe law of force will yield to the rule of numbers. Socialism, disappointed\r\nof its Utopia, may then repeat the familiar lesson and reproduce the\r\nman-on-horseback, or the world may drop into another abyss, and, after the\r\nensuing \"dark ages,\" like those that swallowed Babylon and Tyre, Greece and\r\nRome, emerge with a new civilization and religion.\r\n\r\n\"Man never is, but always to be blessed.\" We know not whence we came, or\r\nwhither we go. Hope that springs eternal in the human breast tells us\r\nnothing. History seems, as Napoleon said, a series of lies agreed upon, yet\r\nnot without dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nI read in an ultra-sectional non-partisan diatribe that \"Jefferson Davis\r\nmade Aaron Burr respectable,\" a sentence which clearly indicates that the\r\nwriter knew nothing either of Jefferson Davis or Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\nBoth have been subjected to unmeasured abuse. They are variously\r\nmisunderstood. Their chief sin was failure; the one to establish an\r\nimpossible confederacy laid in human slavery, the other to achieve certain\r\nvague schemes of empire in Mexico and the far Southwest, which, if not\r\nvisionary, were premature.\r\n\r\nThe final collapse of the Southern Confederacy can be laid at the door of\r\nno man. It was doomed the day of its birth. The wonder is that sane leaders\r\ncould invoke such odds against them and that a sane people could be induced\r\nto follow. The single glory of the South is that it was able to stand out\r\nso long against such odds.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis was a high-minded and well-intentioned man. He was chosen\r\nto lead the South because he was, in addition, an accomplished soldier. As\r\none who consistently opposed him in his public policies, I can specify no\r\nact to the discredit of his character, his one serious mistake being his\r\nfailiure to secure the peace offered by Abraham Lincoln two short months\r\nbefore Appomattox.\r\n\r\nTaking account of their personalities and the lives they led, there is\r\nlittle to suggest comparison, except that they were soldiers and Senators,\r\nwho, each in his day, filled a foremost place in public affairs.\r\n\r\nAaron Burr, though well born and highly educated, was perhaps a\r\nrudely-minded man. But he was no traitor. If the lovely woman, Theodosia\r\nPrevost, whom he married, had lived, there is reason to believe that the\r\nwhole course and tenor of his career would have been altered. Her death was\r\nan irreparable blow, as it were, a prelude to the series of mischances\r\nthat followed. The death of their daughter, the lovely Theodosia Alston,\r\ncompleted the tragedy of his checkered life.\r\n\r\nBorn a gentleman and attaining soldierly distinction and high place, he\r\nfell a victim to the lure of a soaring ambition and the devious experience\r\nof a man about town.\r\n\r\nThe object of political proscription for all his intellectual and personal\r\nresources, he could not successfully meet and stand against it. There was\r\nnothing in the affair with Hamilton actually to damn and ruin him. Neither\r\nmorally nor politically was Hamilton the better man of the two. Nor was\r\nthere treason in his Mexican scheme. He meant no more with universal\r\nacclaim than Houston did three decades later. To couple his name with that\r\nof Benedict Arnold is historic sacrilege.\r\n\r\nJefferson pursued him relentlessly. But even Jefferson could not have\r\ndestroyed him. When, after an absence of four years abroad, he returned to\r\nAmerica, there was still a future for him had he stood up like a man, but,\r\ninstead, like one confessing defeat, he sank down, whilst the wave of\r\nobloquy rolled over him.\r\n\r\nHis is one of the few pathetic figures in our national history. Mr. Davis\r\nhas had plenty of defenders. Poor Burr has had scarcely an apologist. His\r\noffense, whatever it was, has been overpaid. Even the War of Sections\r\nbegins to fade into the mist and become dreamlike even to those who bore an\r\nactual part in it.\r\n\r\nThe years are gliding swiftly by. Only a little while, and there shall not\r\nbe one man living who saw service on either side of that great struggle of\r\nsystems and ideas. Its passions long ago vanished from manly bosoms. That\r\nhas come to pass within a single generation in America which in Europe\r\nrequired ages to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThere is no disputing the verdict of events. Let us relate them truly and\r\ninterpret them fairly. If the South would have the North do justice to its\r\nheroes, the South must do justice to the heroes of the North. Each must\r\nrender unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's even as each would render\r\nunto God the things that are God's. As living men, standing erect in the\r\npresence of Heaven and the world, the men of the South have grown gray\r\nwithout being ashamed; and they need not fear that History will fail to\r\nvindicate their integrity.\r\n\r\nWhen those are gone that fought the battle, and Posterity comes to strike\r\nthe balance, it will be shown that the makers of the Constitution left\r\nthe relation of the States to the Federal Government and of the Federal\r\nGovernment to the States open to a double construction. It will be told\r\nhow the mistaken notion that slave labor was requisite to the profitable\r\ncultivation of sugar, rice and cotton, raised a paramount property interest\r\nin the Southern section of the Union, whilst in the Northern section,\r\nresponding to the trend of modern thought and the outer movements of\r\nmankind, there arose a great moral sentiment against slavery. The conflict\r\nthus established, gradually but surely sectionalizing party lines, was as\r\ninevitable as it was irrepressible. It was fought out to its bitter\r\nand logical conclusion at Appomattox. It found us a huddle of petty\r\nsovereignties, held together by a rope of sand. It made and it left us a\r\nNation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter the Thirty-Second\r\n\r\n    A War Episode--I Meet my Fater--I Marry and Make a Home--The Ups and\r\n    Downs of Life Lead to a Happy Old Age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bringing these desultory--perhaps too fragmentary--recollections to a\r\nclose the writer may not be denied his final word. This shall neither be\r\nself-confident nor overstated; the rather a confession of faith somewhat in\r\nrejection of political and religious pragmatism. In both his experience has\r\nbeen ample if not exhaustive. During the period of their serial publication\r\nhe has received many letters--suggestive, informatory and critical--now and\r\nagain querulous--which he has not failed to consider, and, where occasion\r\nseemed to require, to pursue to original sources in quest of accuracy. In\r\nno instance has he found any essential error in his narrative. Sometimes he\r\nhas been charged with omissions--as if he were writing a history of his own\r\ntimes--whereas he has been only, and he fears, most imperfectly, relating\r\nhis immediate personal experience.\r\n\r\nI was born in the Presbyterian Church, baptized in the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, educated in the Church of England in America and married into the\r\nChurch of the Disciples. The Roman Catholic baptism happened in this way:\r\nIt was my second summer; my parents were sojourning in the household of a\r\ndevout Catholic family; my nurse was a fond, affectionate Irish Catholic;\r\nthe little life was almost despaired of, so one sunny day, to rescue me\r\nfrom that form of theologic controversy known as infant damnation, the baby\r\ncarriage was trundled round the corner to Saint Matthew's Church--it was in\r\nthe national capital--and the baby brow was touched with holy water out of\r\na font blessed of the Virgin Mary. Surely I have never felt or been the\r\nworse for it.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was yet too young to understand I witnessed an old-fashioned\r\nbaptism of the countryside. A person who had borne a very bad character in\r\nthe neighborhood was being immersed. Some one, more humorous than reverent,\r\nstanding near me, said as the man came to the surface, \"There go his sins,\r\nmen and brethren, there go his sins\"; and having but poor eyesight I\r\nthought I saw them passing down the stream never to trouble him, or\r\nanybody, more. I can see them still floating, floating down the stream, out\r\nand away from the sight of men. Does this make me a Baptist, I wonder?\r\n\r\nI fear not, I fear not; because I am unable to rid myself of the impression\r\nthat there are many roads leading to heaven, and I have never believed in\r\nwhat is called close communion. I have not hated and am unable to hate any\r\nman because either in political or in religious opinion he differs from\r\nme and insists upon voting his party ticket and worshiping his Creator\r\naccording to his conscience. Perfect freedom of conscience and thought has\r\nbeen my lifelong contention.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have been born an insurrecto. Pursuing the story of the\r\ndark ages when men were burnt at the stake for the heresy of refusing to\r\nbow to the will of the majority, it is not the voice of the Protestant or\r\nthe Catholic that issues from the flames and reaches my heart, but the cry\r\nof suffering man, my brother. To me a saint is a saint whether he wears\r\nwooden shoes or goes barefoot, whether he gets his baptism silently out\r\nof a font of consecrated water or comes dripping from the depths of\r\nthe nearest brook, shouting, \"Glory hallelujah!\" From my boyhood the\r\npersecution of man for opinion's sake--and no matter for what opinion's\r\nsake--has roused within me the only devil I have ever personally known.\r\n\r\nMy reading has embraced not a few works which seek or which affect to deal\r\nwith the mystery of life and death. Each and every one of them leaves a\r\nmystery still. For all their learning and research--their positivity and\r\ncontradiction--none of the writers know more than I think I know myself,\r\nand all that I think I know myself may be abridged to the simple rescript,\r\nI know nothing. The wisest of us reck not whence we came or whither we go;\r\nthe human mind is unable to conceive the eternal in either direction; the\r\nsoul of man inscrutable even to himself.\r\n\r\n  _The night has a thousand eyes,\r\n  The day but one;\r\n  Yet the light of the bright world dies\r\n  With the dying sun._\r\n\r\n  _The mind has a thousand eyes,\r\n  The heart but one;\r\n  Yet the light of a whole life dies\r\n  When love is done._\r\n\r\nAll that there is to religion, therefore, is faith; not much more in\r\npolitics. We are variously told that the church is losing its hold upon\r\nmen. If it be true it is either that it gives itself over to theology--the\r\npride of opinion--or yields itself to the celebration of the mammon of\r\nunrighteousness.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that it is true. Never in the history of the world was\r\nJesus of Nazareth so interesting and predominant. Between Buddha, teaching\r\nthe blessing of eternal sleep, and Christ, teaching the blessing of eternal\r\nlife, mankind has been long divided, but slowly, surely, the influence of\r\nthe Christ has overtaken that of the Buddha until that portion of the world\r\nwhich has advanced most by process of evolution from the primal state of\r\nman now worships at the shrine of Christ and him risen from the dead, not\r\nat the sign of Buddha and total oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe blessed birthright from God, the glory of heaven, the teaching and\r\nexample of the Prince of Peace--have been engulfed beneath oceans of\r\nignorance and superstition through two thousand years of embittered\r\ncontroversy. During the dark ages coming down even to our own time the very\r\nlight of truth was shut out from the eyes and hearts and minds of men. The\r\nblood of the martyrs we were assured in those early days was the seed of\r\nthe church. The blood of the martyrs was the blood of man--weak, cruel,\r\nfallible man, who, whether he got his inspiration from the Tiber or the\r\nRhine, from Geneva, from Edinburgh or from Rome, did equally the devil's\r\nwork in God's name. None of the viceregents of heaven, as they claimed to\r\nbe, knew much or seemed to care much about the word of the Gentle One of\r\nBethlehem, whom they had adopted as their titular divinity much as men in\r\ncommerce adopt a trade-mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was knock-down and drag-out theology, the ruthless machinery of\r\norganized churchism--the rank materialism of things temporal--not the\r\nteachings of Christ and the spirit of the Christian religion--which so long\r\nfilled the world with blood and tears.\r\n\r\nI have often in talking with intelligent Jews expressed a wonder that they\r\nshould stigmatize the most illustrious Jew as an impostor, saying to them:\r\n\"What matters it whether Jesus was of divine or human parentage--a human\r\nbeing or an immortal spirit? He was a Jew: a glorious, unoffending Jew,\r\ndone to death by a mob of hoodlums in Jerusalem. Why should not you and I\r\ncall him Master and kneel together in love and pity at his feet?\"\r\n\r\nNever have I received any satisfying answer. Partyism--churchism--will\r\never stick to its fetish. Too many churches--or, shall I say, church\r\nfabrics--breeding controversy where there should be agreement, each sect\r\nand subdivision fighting phantoms of its fancy. In the city that once\r\nproclaimed itself eternal there is war between the Quirinal and the\r\nVatican, the government of Italy and the papal hierarchy. In France the\r\ngovernment of the republic and the Church of Rome are at daggers-drawn.\r\nBefore the world-war England and Germany--each claiming to be\r\nProtestant--were looking on askance, irresolute, not as to which side might\r\nbe right and which wrong, but on which side \"is my bread to be buttered?\"\r\nIn America, where it was said by the witty Frenchmen we have fifty\r\nreligions and only one soup, there are people who think we should begin\r\nto organize to stop the threatened coming of the Pope, and such like! \"O\r\nLiberty,\" cried Madame Roland, \"how many crimes are committed in thy name!\"\r\n\"O Churchism,\" may I not say, \"how much nonsense is trolled off in thy\r\nname!\"\r\n\r\nI would think twice before trusting the wisest and best of men with\r\nabsolute power; but I would trust never any body of men--never any\r\nSanhedrim, consistory, church congress or party convention--with absolute\r\npower. Honest men are often led to do or to assent, in association, what\r\nthey would disdain upon their conscience and responsibility as individuals.\r\n_En masse_ extremism generally prevails, and extremism is always\r\nwrong; it is the more wrong and the more dangerous because it is rarely\r\nwanting for plausible sophistries, furnishing congenial and convincing\r\nargument to the mind of the unthinking for whatever it has to propose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nToo many churches and too much partyism! It is love--love through grace of\r\nGod--truth where we can find it--which shall irradiate the life that is.\r\nIf when we have prepared ourselves for the life to come love be wanting,\r\nnothing else is much worth while. Not alone the love of man for woman,\r\nbut the love of woman for woman and of man for man; the divine fraternity\r\ntaught us by the Sermon on the Mount; the religion of giving, not of\r\ngetting; of whole-hearted giving; of joy in the love and the joy of others.\r\n\r\n  _Who giveth himself with his alms feeds three--\r\n  Himself, his hungering neighbor and Me_.\r\n\r\nFor myself I can truthfully subscribe to the formula: \"I believe in God the\r\nFather Almighty; Maker of heaven and earth. And Jesus Christ, his only Son,\r\nwho was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered\r\nunder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; He descended into\r\nhell, the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven,\r\nand sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He\r\nshall come to judge the quick and the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThat is my faith. It is my religion. It was my cradle song. It may not be,\r\ndear ones of contrariwise beliefs, your cradle song or your belief, or your\r\nreligion. What boots it? Can you discover another in word and deed, in\r\nluminous, far-reaching power of speech and example, to walk by the side of\r\nthis the Anointed One of your race and of my belief?\r\n\r\nAs the Irish priest said to the British prelate touching the doctrine of\r\npurgatory: \"You may go further and fare worse, my lord,\" so may I say to my\r\nJewish friends--\"Though the stars in their courses lied to the Wise Men of\r\nthe desert, the bloody history of your Judea, altogether equal in atrocity\r\nto the bloody history of our Christendom, has yet to fulfill the promise\r\nof a Messiah--and were it not well for those who proclaim themselves God's\r\npeople to pause and ask, 'Has He not arisen already?'\"\r\n\r\nI would not inveigh against either the church or its ministry; I would not\r\nstigmatize temporal preaching; I would have ministers of religion as free\r\nto discuss the things of this world as the statesmen and the journalists;\r\nbut with this difference: That the objective point with them shall be the\r\nregeneration of man through grace of God and not the winning of office or\r\nthe exploitation of parties and newspapers. Journalism is yet too unripe to\r\ndo more than guess at truth from a single side. The statesman stands mainly\r\nfor political organism. Until he dies he is suspect. The pulpit remains\r\ntherefore still the moral hope of the universe and the spiritual light of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nIt must be nonpartisan. It must be nonprofessional. It must be manly and\r\nindependent. But it must also be worldy-wise, not artificial, sympathetic,\r\nbroad-minded and many-sided, equally ready to smite wrong in high places\r\nand to kneel by the bedside of the lowly and the poor.\r\n\r\nI have so found most of the clergymen I have known, the exceptions too few\r\nto remember. In spite of the opulence we see about us let us not take to\r\nourselves too much conceit. May every pastor emulate the virtues of that\r\nvillage preacher of whom it was written that:\r\n\r\n  _Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,\r\n  And fools who came to scoff, remained to pray._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _A man he was to all the country dear,\r\n  And passing rich with forty pounds a year._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _His house was known to all the vagrant train,\r\n  He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;\r\n  The long-remembered beggar was his guest,\r\n  Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;\r\n  The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,\r\n  Claimed kindred there, and had his claims allowed;\r\n  The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,\r\n  Sate by the fire, and talked the night away;\r\n  Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,\r\n  Shouldered his crutch, and showed how fields were won.\r\n  Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,\r\n  And quite forgot their vices in their woe;\r\n  Careless their merits or their faults to scan,\r\n  His pity gave ere charity began._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI have lived a long life--rather a happy and a busy than a merry\r\none--enjoying where I might, but, let me hope I may fairly claim, shirking\r\nno needful labor or duty. The result is some accretions to my credit. It\r\nwere, however, ingratitude and vanity in me to set up exclusive ownership\r\nof these. They are the joint products and property of my dear wife and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI do not know just what had befallen if love had failed me, for as far back\r\nas I can remember love has been to me the bedrock of all that is worth\r\nliving for, striving for or possessing in this cross-patch of a world of\r\nours.\r\n\r\nI had realized the meaning of it in the beautiful concert of affection\r\nbetween my father and mother, who lived to celebrate their golden\r\nwedding. My wife and I have enjoyed now the like conjugal felicity\r\nfifty-four--counted to include two years of betrothal, fifty-six years.\r\nNever was a young fellow more in love than I--never has love been more\r\nrichly rewarded--yet not without some heartbreaking bereavements.\r\n\r\nI met the woman who was to become my wife during the War of Sections--amid\r\nits turmoil and peril--and when at its close we were married, at Nashville,\r\nTennessee, all about us was in mourning, the future an adventure. It was\r\nat Chattanooga, the winter of 1862-63, that fate brought us together and\r\nriveted our destinies. She had a fine contralto voice and led the church\r\nchoir. Doctor Palmer, of New Orleans, was on a certain Sunday well into the\r\nlong prayer of the Presbyterian service. Bragg's army was still in middle\r\nTennessee. There was no thought of an attack. Bang! Bang! Then the bursting\r\nof a shell too close for comfort. Bang! Bang! Then the rattle of shell\r\nfragments on the roof. On the other side of the river the Yankees were upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe man of God gave no sign that anything unusual was happening. He did not\r\nhurry. He did not vary the tones of his voice. He kept on praying. Nor was\r\nthere panic in the congregation, which did not budge.\r\n\r\nThat was the longest long prayer I ever heard. When it was finally ended,\r\nand still without changing a note the preacher delivered the benediction,\r\nthe crowded church in the most orderly manner moved to the several\r\ndoorways.\r\n\r\nI was quick to go for my girl. By the time we reached the street the firing\r\nhad become general. We had to traverse quite half a mile of it before\r\nattaining a place of safety. Two weeks later we were separated for nearly\r\ntwo years, when, the war over, we found ourselves at home again.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime her father had fallen in the fight, and in the far South\r\nI had buried him. He was one of the most eminent and distinguished and\r\naltogether the best beloved of the Tennesseeans of his day, Andrew Ewing,\r\nwho, though a Democrat, had in high party times represented the Whig\r\nNashville district in Congress and in the face of assured election declined\r\nthe Democratic nomination for governor of the state. A foremost Union\r\nleader in the antecedent debate, upon the advent of actual war he had\r\nreluctantly but resolutely gone with his state and section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intractable Abolitionists of the North and the radical Secessionists of\r\nthe South have much historically to answer for. The racial warp and woof in\r\nthe United States were at the outset of our national being substantially\r\nhomogeneous. That the country should have been geographically divided and\r\nsectionally set by the ears over the institution of African slavery was\r\nthe work of agitation that might have attained its ends by less costly\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nHow often human nature seeking its bent prefers the crooked to the straight\r\nway ahead! The North, having in its ships brought the negroes from Africa\r\nand sold them to the planters of the South, putting the money it got for\r\nthem in its pocket, turned philanthropist. The South, having bought its\r\nslaves from the slave traders of the North under the belief that slave\r\nlabor was requisite to the profitable production of sugar, rice and cotton,\r\nstood by property-rights lawfully acquired, recognized and guaranteed by\r\nthe Constitution. Thence arose an irrepressible conflict of economic forces\r\nand moral ideas whose doubtful adjustment was scarcely worth what it cost\r\nthe two sections in treasure and blood.\r\n\r\nOn the Northern side the issue was made to read freedom, on the Southern\r\nside, self-defense. Neither side had any sure law to coerce the other.\r\nUpon the simple right and wrong of it each was able to establish a case\r\nconvincing to itself. Thus the War of Sections, fought to a finish so\r\ngallantly by the soldiers of both sides, was in its origination largely a\r\ngame of party politics.\r\n\r\nThe extremists and doctrinaires who started the agitation that brought it\r\nabout were relatively few in number. The South was at least defending its\r\nown. That what it considered its rights in the Union and the Territories\r\nbeing assailed it should fight for aggressively lay in the nature of the\r\nsituation and the character of the people. Aggression begot aggression, the\r\nunoffending negro, the provoking cause, a passive agent. Slavery is gone.\r\nThe negro we still have with us. To what end?\r\n\r\nLife indeed is a mystery--a hopelessly unsolved problem. Could there be\r\na stronger argument in favor of a world to come than may be found in the\r\nbrevity and incertitude of the world that is? Where this side of heaven\r\nshall we look for the court of last resort? Who this side of the grave\r\nshall be sure of anything?\r\n\r\nAt this moment the world having reached what seems the apex of human\r\nachievement is topsy-turvy and all agog. Yet have we the record of any\r\nmoment when it was not so? That to keep what we call the middle of the road\r\nis safest most of us believe. But which among us keeps or has ever kept the\r\nmiddle of the road? What else and what next? It is with nations as with\r\nmen. Are we on the way to another terrestrial collapse, and so on ad\r\ninfinitum to the end of time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home which I pictured in my dreams and projected in my hopes came to me\r\nat last. It arrived with my marriage. Then children to bless it. But it\r\nwas not made complete and final--a veritable Kentucky home--until the\r\nall-round, all-night work which had kept my nose to the grindstone had been\r\nshifted to younger shoulders I was able to buy a few acres of arable land\r\nfar out in the county--the County of Jefferson!--and some ancient brick\r\nwalls, which the feminine genius to which I owe so much could convert to\r\nitself and tear apart and make over again. Here \"the sun shines bright\" as\r\nin the song, and--\r\n\r\n  _The corn tops ripe and the meadows in the bloom\r\n  The birds make music all the day._\r\n\r\nThey waken with the dawn--a feathered orchestra--incessant, fearless--for\r\neach of its pieces--from the sweet trombone of the dove to the shrill\r\nclarionet of the jay--knows that it is safe. There are no guns about. We\r\nhave with us, and have had for five and twenty years, a family of colored\r\npeople who know our ways and meet them intelligently and faithfully.\r\nWhen we go away--as we do each winter and sometimes during the other\r\nseasons--and come again--dinner is on the table, and everybody--even to\r\nTigue and Bijou, the dogs--is glad to see us. Could mortal ask for more?\r\nAnd so let me close with the wish of my father's old song come true--the\r\nwords sufficiently descriptive of the reality:\r\n\r\n _In the downhill of life when I find I'm declining,\r\n      May my fate no less fortunate be\r\n  Than a snug elbow chair can afford for reclining\r\n      And a cot that o'erlooks the wide sea--\r\n  A cow for my dairy, a dog for my game.\r\n      And a purse when my friend needs to borrow;\r\n  I'll envy no nabob his riches, nor fame,\r\n      Nor the honors that wait him to-morrow._\r\n\r\n _And when at the close I throw off this frail cov'ring\r\n      Which I've worn for three-score years and ten--\r\n  On the brink of the grave I'll not seek to keep hov'ring\r\n      Nor my thread wish to spin o'er again.\r\n  But my face in the glass I'll serenely survey,\r\n      And with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow--\r\n  That this worn-out old stuff which is thread-bare to-day_",
