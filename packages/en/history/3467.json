  "content": "THE LIFE OF CESARE BORGIA\r\n\r\nOf France, Duke of Valentinois and Romagna, Prince of Andria and Venafri\r\nCount of Dyois, Lord of Piombino, Camerino and Urbino, Gonfalonier and\r\nCaptain-General of Holy Church\r\n\r\nA History and Some Criticisms\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Rafael Sabatini\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThis is no Chronicle of Saints. Nor yet is it a History of Devils. It is\r\na record of certain very human, strenuous men in a very human, strenuous\r\nage; a lustful, flamboyant age; an age red with blood and pale with\r\npassion at white-heat; an age of steel and velvet, of vivid colour,\r\ndazzling light and impenetrable shadow; an age of swift movement,\r\npitiless violence and high endeavour, of sharp antitheses and amazing\r\ncontrasts.\r\n\r\nTo judge it from the standpoint of this calm, deliberate, and correct\r\ncentury--as we conceive our own to be--is for sedate middle-age to judge\r\nfrom its own standpoint the reckless, hot, passionate, lustful humours\r\nof youth, of youth that errs grievously and achieves greatly.\r\n\r\nSo to judge that epoch collectively is manifestly wrong, a hopeless\r\nprocedure if it be our aim to understand it and to be in sympathy with\r\nit, as it becomes broad-minded age to be tolerantly in sympathy with the\r\nyouth whose follies it perceives. Life is an ephemeral business, and\r\nwe waste too much of it in judging where it would beseem us better to\r\naccept, that we ourselves may come to be accepted by such future ages as\r\nmay pursue the study of us.\r\n\r\nBut if it be wrong to judge a past epoch collectively by the standards\r\nof our own time, how much more is it not wrong to single out individuals\r\nfor judgement by those same standards, after detaching them for the\r\npurpose from the environment in which they had their being? How false\r\nmust be the conception of them thus obtained! We view the individuals so\r\nselected through a microscope of modern focus. They appear monstrous\r\nand abnormal, and we straight-way assume them to be monsters and\r\nabnormalities, never considering that the fault is in the adjustment\r\nof the instrument through which we inspect them, and that until that is\r\ncorrected others of that same past age, if similarly viewed, must appear\r\nsimilarly distorted.\r\n\r\nHence it follows that some study of an age must ever prelude and\r\naccompany the study of its individuals, if comprehension is to wait upon\r\nour labours. To proceed otherwise is to judge an individual Hottentot or\r\nSouth Sea Islander by the code of manners that obtains in Belgravia or\r\nMayfair.\r\n\r\nMind being the seat of the soul, and literature being the expression of\r\nthe mind, literature, it follows, is the soul of an age, the surviving\r\nand immortal part of it; and in the literature of the Cinquecento you\r\nshall behold for the looking the ardent, unmoral, naïve soul of this\r\nRenaissance that was sprawling in its lusty, naked infancy and bellowing\r\nhungrily for the pap of knowledge, and for other things. You shall\r\ninfer something of the passionate mettle of this infant: his\r\ntempestuous mirth, his fierce rages, his simplicity, his naïveté, his\r\ninquisitiveness, his cunning, his deceit, his cruelty, his love of\r\nsunshine and bright gewgaws.\r\n\r\nTo realize him as he was, you need but to bethink you that this was\r\nthe age in which the Decamerone of Giovanni Boccaccio, the Facetiae of\r\nPoggio, the Satires of Filelfo, and the Hermaphroditus of Panormitano\r\nafforded reading-matter to both sexes. This was the age in which the\r\nlearned and erudite Lorenzo Valla--of whom more anon--wrote his famous\r\nindictment of virginity, condemning it as against nature with arguments\r\nof a most insidious logic. This was the age in which Casa, Archbishop\r\nof Benevento, wrote a most singular work of erotic philosophy, which,\r\ncoming from a churchman’s pen, will leave you cold with horror should\r\nyou chance to turn its pages. This was the age of the Discovery of Man;\r\nthe pagan age which stripped Christ of His divinity to bestow it upon\r\nPlato, so that Marsilio Ficino actually burnt an altar-lamp before an\r\nimage of the Greek by whose teachings--in common with so many scholars\r\nof his day--he sought to inform himself.\r\n\r\nIt was an age that had become unable to discriminate between the merits\r\nof the Saints of the Church and the Harlots of the Town. Therefore it\r\nhonoured both alike, extolled the carnal merits of the one in much the\r\nsame terms as were employed to extol the spiritual merits of the other.\r\nThus when a famous Roman courtesan departed this life in the year 1511,\r\nat the early age of twenty-six, she was accorded a splendid funeral and\r\nan imposing tomb in the Chapel Santa Gregoria with a tablet bearing the\r\nfollowing inscription:\r\n\r\n“IMPERIA CORTISANA ROMANA QUAE DIGNA TANTO NOMINE, RARAE INTER MORTALES\r\nFORMAE SPECIMEN DEDIT.”\r\n\r\nIt was, in short, an age so universally immoral as scarcely to be termed\r\nimmoral, since immorality may be defined as a departure from the morals\r\nthat obtain a given time and in a given place. So that whilst from\r\nour own standpoint the Cinquecento, taken collectively, is an age of\r\ngrossest licence and immorality, from the standpoint of the Cinquecento\r\nitself few of its individuals might with justice be branded immoral.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, it was an epoch of reaction from the Age of Chivalry:\r\nan epoch of unbounded luxury, of the cult and worship of the beautiful\r\nexternally; an epoch that set no store by any inward virtue, by truth\r\nor honour; an epoch that laid it down as a maxim that no inconvenient\r\nengagement should be kept if opportunity offered to evade it.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Cinquecento is a history developed in broken pledges,\r\ntrusts dishonoured and basest treacheries, as you shall come to conclude\r\nbefore you have read far in the story that is here to be set down.\r\n\r\nIn a profligate age what can you look for but profligates? Is it just,\r\nis it reasonable, or is it even honest to take a man or a family from\r\nsuch an environment, for judgement by the canons of a later epoch? Yet\r\nis it not the method that has been most frequently adopted in dealing\r\nwith the vast subject of the Borgias?\r\n\r\nTo avoid the dangers that must wait upon that error, the history of that\r\nHouse shall here be taken up with the elevation of Calixtus III to the\r\nPapal Throne; and the reign of the four Popes immediately preceding\r\nRoderigo Borgia--who reigned as Alexander VI--shall briefly be surveyed\r\nthat a standard may be set by which to judge the man and the family that\r\nform the real subject of this work.\r\n\r\nThe history of this amazing Pope Alexander is yet to be written. No\r\nattempt has been made to exhaust it here. Yet of necessity he bulks\r\nlarge in these pages; for the history of his dazzling, meteoric son is\r\nso closely interwoven with his own that it is impossible to present the\r\none without dealing at considerable length with the other.\r\n\r\nThe sources from which the history of the House of Borgia has been\r\nculled are not to be examined in a preface. They are too numerous,\r\nand they require too minute and individual a consideration that their\r\nprecise value and degree of credibility may be ascertained. Abundantly\r\nshall such examination be made in the course of this history, and in\r\na measure as the need arises to cite evidence for one side or for the\r\nother shall that evidence be sifted.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, has anything more true been written of the Borgias and\r\ntheir history than the matter contained in the following lines of Rawdon\r\nBrown in his Ragguagli sulla Vita e sulle Opere di Marino Sanuto: “It\r\nseems to me that history has made use of the House of Borgia as of\r\na canvas upon which to depict the turpitudes of the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries.”\r\n\r\nMaterials for the work were very ready to the hand; and although they\r\ndo not signally differ from the materials out of which the histories\r\nof half a dozen Popes of the same epoch might be compiled, they are far\r\nmore abundant in the case of the Borgia Pope, for the excellent reason\r\nthat the Borgia Pope detaches from the background of the Renaissance far\r\nmore than any of his compeers by virtue of his importance as a political\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIn this was reason to spare for his being libelled and lampooned even\r\nbeyond the usual extravagant wont. Slanders concerning him and his son\r\nCesare were readily circulated, and they will generally be found\r\nto spring from those States which had most cause for jealousy and\r\nresentment of the Borgia might--Venice, Florence, and Milan, amongst\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNo rancour is so bitter as political rancour--save, perhaps, religious\r\nrancour, which we shall also trace; no warfare more unscrupulous or more\r\nprone to use the insidious weapons of slander than political warfare.\r\nOf this such striking instances abound in our own time that there can\r\nscarce be the need to labour the point. And from the form taken by such\r\nslanders as are circulated in our own sedate and moderate epoch may be\r\nconceived what might be said by political opponents in a fierce age that\r\nknew no pudency and no restraint. All this in its proper place shall be\r\nmore closely examined.\r\n\r\nFor many of the charges brought against the House of Borgia some\r\ntestimony exists; for many others--and these are the more lurid,\r\nsensational, and appalling covering as they do rape and murder,\r\nadultery, incest, and the sin of the Cities of the Plain--no single\r\ngrain of real evidence is forthcoming. Indeed, at this time of day\r\nevidence is no longer called for where the sins of the Borgias\r\nare concerned. Oft-reiterated assertion has usurped the place of\r\nevidence--for a lie sufficiently repeated comes to be credited by its\r\nvery utterer. And meanwhile the calumny has sped from tongue to tongue,\r\nfrom pen to pen, gathering matter as it goes. The world absorbs the\r\nstories; it devours them greedily so they be sensational, and writers\r\nwell aware of this have been pandering to that morbid appetite for some\r\ncenturies now with this subject of the Borgias. A salted, piquant tale\r\nof vice, a ghastly story of moral turpitude and physical corruption,\r\na hair-raising narrative of horrors and abominations--these are the\r\nstock-in-trade of the sensation-monger. With the authenticity of the\r\nmatters he retails such a one has no concern. “Se non é vero é ben\r\ntrovato,” is his motto, and in his heart the sensation-monger--of\r\nwhatsoever age--rather hopes the thing be true. He will certainly\r\nmake his public so believe it; for to discredit it would be to lose\r\nnine-tenths of its sensational value. So he trims and adjusts his wares,\r\nadds a touch or two of colour and what else he accounts necessary\r\nto heighten their air of authenticity, to dissemble any peeping\r\nspuriousness.\r\n\r\nA form of hypnosis accompanies your study of the subject--a suggestion\r\nthat what is so positively and repeatedly stated must of necessity be\r\ntrue, must of necessity have been proved by irrefutable evidence at some\r\ntime or other. So much you take for granted--for matters which began\r\ntheir existence perhaps as tentative hypotheses have imperceptibly\r\ndeveloped into established facts.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it happens that we find some such sentence as the following\r\nsumming up this deed or that one in the Borgia histories: “A deal of\r\nmystery remains to be cleared up, but the Verdict of History assigns the\r\nguilt to Cesare Borgia.”\r\n\r\nBehold how easy it is to dispense with evidence. So that your tale\r\nbe well-salted and well-spiced, a fico for evidence! If it hangs not\r\noverwell together in places, if there be contradictions, lacunae, or\r\nopenings for doubt, fling the Verdict of History into the gap, and so\r\nstrike any questioner into silence.\r\n\r\nSo far have matters gone in this connection that who undertakes to set\r\ndown to-day the history of Cesare Borgia, with intent to do just and\r\nhonest work, must find it impossible to tell a plain and straightforward\r\ntale--to present him not as a villain of melodrama, not a monster,\r\nludicrous, grotesque, impossible, but as human being, a cold, relentless\r\negotist, it is true, using men for his own ends, terrible and even\r\ntreacherous in his reprisals, swift as a panther and as cruel where his\r\nanger was aroused, yet with certain elements of greatness: a splendid\r\nsoldier, an unrivalled administrator, a man pre-eminently just, if\r\nmerciless in that same justice.\r\n\r\nTo present Cesare Borgia thus in a plain straightforward tale at this\r\ntime of day, would be to provoke the scorn and derision of those who\r\nhave made his acquaintance in the pages of that eminent German scholar,\r\nFerdinand Gregorovius, and of some other writers not quite so eminent\r\nyet eminent enough to serve serious consideration. Hence has it been\r\nnecessary to examine at close quarters the findings of these great ones,\r\nand to present certain criticisms of those same findings. The author is\r\noverwhelmingly conscious of the invidious quality of that task; but he\r\nis no less conscious of its inevitability if this tale is to be told at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhilst the actual sources of historical evidence shall be examined in\r\nthe course of this narrative, it may be well to examine at this stage\r\nthe sources of the popular conceptions of the Borgias, since there will\r\nbe no occasion later to allude to them.\r\n\r\nWithout entering here into a dissertation upon the historical romance,\r\nit may be said that in proper hands it has been and should continue to\r\nbe one of the most valued and valuable expressions of the literary art.\r\nTo render and maintain it so, however, it is necessary that certain\r\nwell-defined limits should be set upon the licence which its writers\r\nare to enjoy; it is necessary that the work should be honest work; that\r\npreparation for it should be made by a sound, painstaking study of the\r\nperiod to be represented, to the end that a true impression may first be\r\nformed and then conveyed. Thus, considering how much more far-reaching\r\nis the novel than any other form of literature, the good results that\r\nmust wait upon such endeavours are beyond question. The neglect of\r\nthem--the distortion of character to suit the romancer’s ends, the like\r\ndistortion of historical facts, the gross anachronisms arising out of\r\na lack of study, have done much to bring the historical romance into\r\ndisrepute. Many writers frankly make no pretence--leastways none that\r\ncan be discerned--of aiming at historical precision; others, however,\r\ninvest their work with a spurious scholarliness, go the length of citing\r\nauthorities to support the point of view which they have taken, and\r\nwhich they lay before you as the fruit of strenuous lucubrations.\r\n\r\nThese are the dangerous ones, and of this type is Victor Hugo’s famous\r\ntragedy Lucrezia Borgia, a work to which perhaps more than to any other\r\n(not excepting Les Borgias in Crimes Célèbres of Alexandre Dumas) is due\r\nthe popular conception that prevails to-day of Cesare Borgia’s sister.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether anything has ever flowed from a distinguished\r\npen in which so many licences have been taken with the history of\r\nindividuals and of an epoch; in which there is so rich a crop of crude,\r\ntranspontine absurdities and flagrant, impossible anachronisms. Victor\r\nHugo was a writer of rare gifts, a fertile romancer and a great poet,\r\nand it may be unjust to censure him for having taken the fullest\r\nadvantages of the licences conceded to both. But it would be difficult\r\nto censure him too harshly for having--in his Lucrezia Borgia--struck a\r\npose of scholarliness, for having pretended and maintained that his work\r\nwas honest work founded upon the study of historical evidences. With\r\nthat piece of charlatanism he deceived the great mass of the unlettered\r\nof France and of all Europe into believing that in his tragedy he\r\npresented the true Lucrezia Borgia.\r\n\r\n“If you do not believe me,” he declared, “read Tommaso Tommasi, read the\r\nDiary of Burchard.”\r\n\r\nRead, then, that Diary, extending over a period of twenty-three years,\r\nfrom 1483 to 1506, of the Master of Ceremonies of the Vatican (which\r\nlargely contributes the groundwork of the present history), and the one\r\nconclusion to which you will be forced is that Victor Hugo himself had\r\nnever read it, else he would have hesitated to bid you refer to a work\r\nwhich does not support a single line that he has written.\r\n\r\nAs for Tommaso Tommasi--oh, the danger of a little learning! Into what\r\nquagmires does it not lead those who flaunt it to impress you!\r\n\r\nTommasi’s place among historians is on precisely the same plane as\r\nAlexandre Dumas’s. His Vita di Cesare Borgia is on the same historical\r\nlevel as Les Borgias, much of which it supplied. Like Crimes Célèbres,\r\nTommasi’s book is invested with a certain air of being a narrative of\r\nsober fact; but like Crimes Célèbres, it is none the less a work of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nThis Tommaso Tommasi, whose real name was Gregorio Leti--and it is under\r\nthis that such works of his as are reprinted are published nowadays--was\r\na most prolific author of the seventeenth century, who, having turned\r\nCalvinist, vented in his writings a mordacious hatred of the Papacy and\r\nof the religion from which he had seceded. His Life of Cesare Borgia was\r\npublished in 1670. It enjoyed a considerable vogue, was translated into\r\nFrench, and has been the chief source from which many writers of fiction\r\nand some writers of “fact” have drawn for subsequent work to carry\r\nforward the ceaseless defamation of the Borgias.\r\n\r\nHistory should be as inexorable as Divine Justice. Before we admit\r\nfacts, not only should we call for evidence and analyse it when it is\r\nforthcoming, but the very sources of such evidence should be examined,\r\nthat, as far as possible, we may ascertain what degree of credit they\r\ndeserve. In the study of the history of the Borgias, we repeat, there\r\nhas been too much acceptance without question, too much taking\r\nfor granted of matters whose incredibility frequently touches and\r\noccasionally oversteps the confines of the impossible.\r\n\r\nOne man knew Cesare Borgia better, perhaps, than did any other\r\ncontemporary, of the many who have left more or less valuable records;\r\nfor the mind of that man was the acutest of its age, one of the acutest\r\nItaly and the world have ever known. That man was Niccolô Macchiavelli,\r\nSecretary of State to the Signory of Florence. He owed no benefits to\r\nCesare; he was the ambassador of a power that was ever inimical to the\r\nBorgias; so that it is not to be dreamt that his judgement suffered from\r\nany bias in Cesare’s favour. Yet he accounted Cesare Borgia--as we shall\r\nsee--the incarnation of an ideal conqueror and ruler; he took Cesare\r\nBorgia as the model for his famous work The Prince, written as a grammar\r\nof statecraft for the instruction in the art of government of that\r\nweakling Giuliano de’Medici.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli pronounces upon Cesare Borgia the following verdict:\r\n\r\n“If all the actions of the duke are taken into consideration, it will\r\nbe seen how great were the foundations he had laid to future power. Upon\r\nthese I do not think it superfluous to discourse, because I should not\r\nknow what better precept to lay before a new prince than the example of\r\nhis actions; and if success did not wait upon what dispositions he\r\nhad made, that was through no fault of his own, but the result of an\r\nextraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.”\r\n\r\nIn its proper place shall be considered what else Macchiavelli had to\r\nsay of Cesare Borgia and what to report of events that he witnessed\r\nconnected with Cesare Borgia’s career.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the above summary of Macchiavelli’s judgement is put forward\r\nas a justification for the writing of this book, which has for scope to\r\npresent to you the Cesare Borgia who served as the model for The Prince.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, however, there is the rise of the House of Borgia to be\r\ntraced, and in the first two of the four books into which this history\r\nwill be divided it is Alexander VI, rather than his son, who will hold\r\nthe centre of the stage.\r\n\r\nIf the author has a mercy to crave of his critics, it is that they\r\nwill not impute it to him that he has set out with the express aim of\r\n“whitewashing”--as the term goes--the family of Borgia. To whitewash is\r\nto overlay, to mask the original fabric under a superadded surface. Too\r\nmuch superadding has there been here already. By your leave, all\r\nshall be stripped away. The grime shall be removed and the foulness of\r\ninference, of surmise, of deliberate and cold-blooded malice, with which\r\ncenturies of scribblers, idle, fantastic, sensational, or venal, have\r\ncoated the substance of known facts.\r\n\r\nBut the grime shall be preserved and analysed side by side with the\r\nactual substance, that you may judge if out of zeal to remove the former\r\nany of the latter shall have been included in the scraping.\r\n\r\nThe author expresses his indebtedness to the following works which,\r\namongst others, have been studied for the purposes of the present\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\n  Alvisi, Odoardo, Cesare Borgia, Duca di Romagna.

THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF BORGIA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the House of Borgia, which gave to the Church of Rome two popes\r\nand at least one saint,(1) is to be traced back to the eleventh century,\r\nclaiming as it does to have its source in the Kings of Aragon, we shall\r\ntake up its history for our purposes with the birth at the city of\r\nXativa, in the kingdom of Valencia, on December 30, 1378, of Alonso de\r\nBorja, the son of Don Juan Domingo de Borja and his wife Doña Francisca.\r\n\r\n     1  St. Francisco Borgia, S.J.--great-grandson of Pope\r\n     Alexander VI, born at Gandia, in Spain, in 1510.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Don Alonso de Borja is due the rise of his family to its\r\nstupendous eminence. An able, upright, vigorous-minded man, he became a\r\nProfessor and Doctor of Jurisprudence at the University of Lerida,\r\nand afterwards served Alfonso I of Aragon, King of Naples and the Two\r\nSicilies, in the capacity of secretary. This office he filled with the\r\ndistinction that was to be expected from one so peculiarly fitted for it\r\nby the character of the studies he had pursued.\r\n\r\nHe was made Bishop of Valencia, created Cardinal in 1444, and\r\nfinally--in 1455--ascended the throne of St. Peter as Calixtus III, an\r\nold man, enfeebled in body, but with his extraordinary vigour of mind\r\nall unimpaired.\r\n\r\nCalixtus proved himself as much a nepotist as many another Pope before\r\nand since. This needs not to be dilated upon here; suffice it that\r\nin February of 1456 he gave the scarlet hat of Cardinal-Deacon of San\r\nNiccoló, in Carcere Tulliano, to his nephew Don Roderigo de Lanzol y\r\nBorja.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1431 at Xativa, the son of Juana de Borja (sister of Calixtus)\r\nand her husband Don Jofrè de Lanzol, Roderigo was in his twenty-fifth\r\nyear at the time of his being raised to the purple, and in the following\r\nyear he was further created Vice-Chancellor of Holy Church with an\r\nannual stipend of eight thousand florins. Like his uncle he had studied\r\njurisprudence--at the University of Bologna--and mentally and physically\r\nhe was extraordinarily endowed.\r\n\r\nFrom the pen-portraits left of him by Gasparino of Verona, and Girolamo\r\nPorzio, we know him for a tall, handsome man with black eyes and full\r\nlips, elegant, courtly, joyous, and choicely eloquent, of such health\r\nand vigour and endurance that he was insensible to any fatigue. Giasone\r\nMaino of Milan refers to his “elegant appearance, serene brow, royal\r\nglance, a countenance that at once expresses generosity and majesty, and\r\nthe genial and heroic air with which his whole personality is invested.”\r\n To a similar description of him Gasparino adds that “all women upon whom\r\nhe so much as casts his eyes he moves to love him; attracting them as\r\nthe lodestone attracts iron;” which is, it must be admitted, a most\r\nundesirable reputation in a churchman.\r\n\r\nA modern historian(1) who uses little restraint when writing of Roderigo\r\nBorgia says of him that “he was a man of neither much energy nor\r\ndetermined will,” and further that “the firmness and energy wanting to\r\nhis character were, however, often replaced by the constancy of his evil\r\npassions, by which he was almost blinded.” How the constancy of evil\r\npassions can replace firmness and energy as factors of worldly success\r\nis not readily discernible, particularly if their possessor is blinded\r\nby them. The historical worth of the stricture may safely be left to be\r\nmeasured by its logical value. For the rest, to say that Roderigo Borgia\r\nwas wanting in energy and in will is to say something to which his\r\nwhole career gives the loud and derisive lie, as will--to some extent at\r\nleast--be seen in the course of this work.\r\n\r\n     1  Pasquale Villari in his Machiavelli i suoi Tempi\r\n\r\n\r\nHis honours as Cardinal-Deacon and Vice-Chancellor of the Holy See he\r\nowed to his uncle; but that he maintained and constantly improved his\r\nposition--and he a foreigner, be it remembered--under the reigns of\r\nthe four succeeding Popes--Pius II, Paul II, Sixtus IV, and Innocent\r\nVIII--until finally, six-and-twenty years after the death of Calixtus\r\nIII, he ascended, himself, the Papal Throne, can be due only to the\r\nunconquerable energy and stupendous talents which have placed him where\r\nhe stands in history--one of the greatest forces, for good or ill, that\r\never occupied St. Peter’s Chair.\r\n\r\nSay of him that he was ambitious, worldly, greedy of power, and a prey\r\nto carnal lusts. All these he was. But for very sanity’s sake do not let\r\nit be said that he was wanting either in energy or in will, for he was\r\nenergy and will incarnate.\r\n\r\nConsider that with Calixtus III’s assumption of the Tiara Rome became\r\nthe Spaniard’s happy hunting-ground, and that into the Eternal City\r\nstreamed in their hundreds the Catalan adventurers--priests, clerks,\r\ncaptains of fortune, and others--who came to seek advancement at the\r\nhands of a Catalan Pope. This Spanish invasion Rome resented. She grew\r\nrestive under it.\r\n\r\nRoderigo’s elder brother, Don Pedro Luis de Lanzol y Borja, was made\r\nGonfalonier of the Church, Castellan of all pontifical fortresses\r\nand Governor of the Patrimony of St. Peter, with the title of Duke of\r\nSpoleto and, later, Prefect of Rome, to the displacement of an Orsini\r\nfrom that office. Calixtus invested this nephew with all temporal power\r\nthat it was in the Church’s privilege to bestow, to the end that he\r\nmight use it as a basis to overset the petty tyrannies of Romagna, and\r\nto establish a feudal claim on the Kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nHere already we see more than a hint of that Borgia ambition which was\r\nto become a byword, and the first attempt of this family to found a\r\ndynasty for itself and a State that should endure beyond the transient\r\ntenure of the Pontificate, an aim that was later to be carried into\r\nactual--if ephemeral--fulfilment by Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nThe Italians watched this growth of Spanish power with jealous, angry\r\neyes. The mighty House of Orsini, angered by the supplanting of one of\r\nits members in the Prefecture of Rome, kept its resentment warm, and\r\nwaited. When in August of 1458 Calixtus III lay dying, the Orsini seized\r\nthe chance: they incited the city to ready insurgence, and with fire and\r\nsword they drove the Spaniards out.\r\n\r\nDon Pedro Luis made haste to depart, contrived to avoid the Orsini, who\r\nhad made him their special quarry, and getting a boat slipped down the\r\nTiber to Civita Vecchia, where he died suddenly some six weeks later,\r\nthereby considerably increasing the wealth of Roderigo, his brother and\r\nhis heir.\r\n\r\nRoderigo’s cousin, Don Luis Juan, Cardinal-Presbyter of Santi Quattro\r\nCoronati, another member of the family who owed his advancement to his\r\nuncle Calixtus, thought it also expedient to withdraw from that zone of\r\ndanger to men of his nationality and name.\r\n\r\nRoderigo de Lanzol y Borja alone remained--leastways, the only prominent\r\nmember of his house--boldly to face the enmity of the majority of the\r\nSacred College, which had looked with grim disfavour upon his uncle’s\r\nnepotism. Unintimidated, he entered the Conclave for the election of a\r\nsuccessor to Calixtus, and there the chance which so often prefers to\r\nbestow its favours upon him who knows how to profit by them, gave him\r\nthe opportunity to establish himself as firmly as ever at the Vatican,\r\nand further to advance his interests.\r\n\r\nIt fell out that when the scrutiny was taken, two cardinals stood\r\nwell in votes--the brilliant, cultured Enea Silvio Bartolomeo\r\nde’ Piccolomini, Cardinal of Siena, and the French Cardinal\r\nd’Estouteville--though neither had attained the minimum majority\r\ndemanded. Of these two, the lead in number of votes lay with the\r\nCardinal of Siena, and his election therefore might be completed\r\nby Accession--that is, by the voices of such cardinals as had not\r\noriginally voted for him--until the minimum majority, which must exceed\r\ntwo-thirds, should be made up.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Vice-Chancellor Roderigo de Lanzol y Borja led this\r\naccession, with the result that the Cardinal of Siena became Pontiff--as\r\nPius II--and was naturally enough disposed to advance the interests of\r\nthe man who had been instrumental in helping him to that eminence. Thus,\r\nhis position at the Vatican, in the very face of all hostility, became\r\nstronger and more prominent than ever.\r\n\r\nA letter written two years later from the Baths at Petriolo by Pius II\r\nto Roderigo when the latter was in Siena--whither he had been sent\r\nby his Holiness to superintend the building of the Cathedral and\r\nthe Episcopal and Piccolomini palaces--is frequently cited by way of\r\nestablishing the young prelate’s dissolute ways. It is a letter at once\r\nstern and affectionate, and it certainly leaves no doubt as to what\r\nmanner of man was the Cardinal Vice-Chancellor in his private life, and\r\nto what manner of unecciesiastical pursuits he inclined. It is difficult\r\nto discover in it any grounds upon which an apologist may build.\r\n\r\n\r\n“BELOVED SON,\r\n\r\n“When four days ago, in the gardens of Giovanni de Bichis, were\r\nassembled several women of Siena addicted to worldly vanity, your\r\nworthiness, as we have learnt, little remembering the office which you\r\nfill, was entertained by them from the seventeenth to the twenty-second\r\nhour. For companion you had one of your colleagues, one whom his years\r\nif not the honour of the Holy See should have reminded of his duty. From\r\nwhat we have heard, dancing was unrestrainedly indulged, and not one of\r\nlove’s attractions was absent, whilst your behaviour was no different\r\nfrom that which might have been looked for in any worldly youth.\r\nTouching what happened there, modesty imposes silence. Not only the\r\ncircumstance itself, but the very name of it is unworthy in one of your\r\nrank. The husbands, parents, brothers, and relations of these young\r\nwomen were excluded, in order that your amusements should be the more\r\nunbridled. You with a few servants undertook to direct and lead those\r\ndances. It is said that nothing is now talked of in Siena but your\r\nfrivolity. Certain it is that here at the baths, where the concourse\r\nof ecclesiastics and laity is great, you are the topic of the day. Our\r\ndispleasure is unutterable, since all this reflects dishonourably upon\r\nthe sacerdotal estate and office. It will be said of us that we are\r\nenriched and promoted not to the end that we may lead blameless lives,\r\nbut that we may procure the means to indulge our pleasures. Hence the\r\ncontempt of us entertained by temporal princes and powers and the daily\r\nsarcasms of the laity. Hence also the reproof of our own mode of life\r\nwhen we attempt to reprove others. The very Vicar of Christ is involved\r\nin this contempt, since he appears to countenance such things. You,\r\nbeloved son, have charge of the Bishopric of Valencia, the first of\r\nSpain; you are also Vice-Chancellor of the Church; and what renders your\r\nconduct still more blameworthy is that you are among the cardinals, with\r\nthe Pope, one of the counsellors of the Holy See. We submit it to your\r\nown judgement whether it becomes your dignity to court young women, to\r\nsend fruit and wine to her you love, and to have no thought for anything\r\nbut pleasure. We are censured on your account; the blessed memory of\r\nyour uncle Calixtus is vituperated, since in the judgement of many\r\nhe was wrong to have conferred so many honours upon you. If you seek\r\nexcuses in your youth, you are no longer so young that you cannot\r\nunderstand what duties are imposed upon you by your dignity. A cardinal\r\nshould be irreproachable, a model of moral conduct to all. And what just\r\ncause have we for resentment when temporal princes bestow upon us titles\r\nthat are little honourable, dispute with us our possessions, and attempt\r\nto bend us to their will? In truth it is we who inflict these wounds\r\nupon ourselves, and it is we who occasion ourselves these troubles,\r\nundermining more and more each day by our deeds the authority of the\r\nChurch. Our guerdon is shame in this world and condign punishment in the\r\nnext. May your prudence therefore set a restraint upon these vanities\r\nand keep you mindful of your dignity, and prevent that you be known for\r\na gallant among married and unmarried women. But should similar facts\r\nrecur, we shall be compelled to signify that they have happened against\r\nour will and to our sorrow, and our censure must be attended by your\r\nshame. We have always loved you, and we have held you worthy of our\r\nfavour as a man of upright and honest nature. Act therefore in such\r\na manner that we may maintain such an opinion of you, and nothing can\r\nbetter conduce to this than that you should lead a well-ordered life.\r\nYour age, which is such as still to promise improvement, admits that we\r\nshould admonish you paternally.”\r\n\r\n“PETRIOLO, June 11, 1460.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a letter is calculated to shock us in our modern notions of a\r\nchurchman. To us this conduct on the part of a prelate is scandalous\r\nbeyond words; that it was scandalous even then is obvious from the\r\nPontiff’s letter; but that it was scandalous in an infinitely lesser\r\ndegree is no less obvious from the very fact that the Pontiff wrote\r\nthat letter (and in such terms) instead of incontinently unfrocking the\r\noffender.\r\n\r\nIn considering Roderigo’s conduct, you are to consider--as has been\r\nurged already--the age in which he lived. You are to remember that it\r\nwas an age in which the passions and the emotions wore no such masks as\r\nthey wear to-day, but went naked and knew no shame of their nudity; an\r\nage in which personal modesty was as little studied as hypocrisy, and in\r\nwhich men, wore their vices as openly as their virtues.\r\n\r\nNo amount of simple statement can convey an adequate notion of the\r\ncorrupt state of the clergy at the time. To form any just appreciation\r\nof this, it is necessary to take a peep at some of the documents that\r\nhave survived--such a document, for instance, as that Bull of this Pope\r\nPius II which forbade priests from plying the trades of keeping taverns,\r\ngaming-houses, and brothels.\r\n\r\nPonder also that under his successor, Sixtus IV, the tax levied upon the\r\ncourtesans of Rome enriched the pontifical coffers to the extent of\r\nsome 20,000 ducats yearly. Ponder further that when the vicar of\r\nthe libidinous Innocent VIII published in 1490 an edict against\r\nthe universal concubinage practised by the clergy, forbidding its\r\ncontinuation under pain of excommunication, all that it earned him was\r\nthe severe censure of the Holy Father, who disagreed with the measure\r\nand who straightway repealed and cancelled the edict.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n     1  See Burchard’s Diarium, Thuasne Edition, Vol. II. p.442\r\n     et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this being considered, and man being admittedly a creature of his\r\nenvironment, can we still pretend to horror at this Roderigo and at the\r\nfact that being the man he was--prelate though he might be--handsome,\r\nbrilliant, courted, in the full vigour of youth, and a voluptuary by\r\nnature, he should have succumbed to the temptations by which he was\r\nsurrounded?\r\n\r\nOne factor only could have caused him to use more restraint--the good\r\nexample of his peers. That example he most certainly had not.\r\n\r\nVirtue is a comparative estate, when all is said; and before we can find\r\nthat Roderigo was vile, that he deserves unqualified condemnation for\r\nhis conduct, we must ascertain that he was more or less exceptional in\r\nhis licence, that he was less scrupulous than his fellows. Do we find\r\nthat? To find the contrary we do not need to go beyond the matter which\r\nprovoked that letter from the Pontiff. For we see that he was not even\r\nalone, as an ecclesiastic, in the adventure; that he had for associate\r\non that amorous frolic one Giacopo Ammanati, Cardinal-Presbyter of\r\nSan Crisogno, Roderigo’s senior and an ordained priest, which--without\r\nseeking to make undue capital out of the circumstance--we may mention\r\nthat Roderigo was not. He was a Cardinal-Deacon, be it remembered.(1) We\r\nknow that the very Pontiff who admonished these young prelates, though\r\nnow admittedly a man of saintly ways, had been a very pretty fellow\r\nhimself in his lusty young days in Siena; we know that Roderigo’s\r\nuncle--the Calixtus to whom Pius II refers in that letter as of “blessed\r\nmemory”--had at least one acknowledged son.(2) We know that Piero and\r\nGirolamo Riario, though styled by Pope Sixtus IV his “nephews,” were\r\ngenerally recognized to be his sons.(3) And we know that the numerous\r\nbastards of Innocent VIII--Roderigo’s immediate precursor on the\r\nPontifical Throne--were openly acknowledged by their father. We know, in\r\nshort, that it was the universal custom of the clergy to forget its vows\r\nof celibacy, and to circumvent them by dispensing with the outward\r\nform and sacrament of marriage; and we have it on the word of Pius II\r\nhimself, that “if there are good reasons for enjoining the celibacy of\r\nthe clergy, there are better and stronger for enjoining them to marry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     1  He was not ordained priest until 1471, after the election\r\n     of Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\n     2  Don Francisco de Borja, born at Valencia in 1441.\r\n\r\n     3  Macchiavelli, Istorie Fiorentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat more is there to say? If we must be scandalized, let us be\r\nscandalized by the times rather than by the man. Upon what reasonable\r\ngrounds can we demand that he should be different from his fellows; and\r\nif we find him no different, what right or reason have we for picking\r\nhim out and rendering him the object of unparalleled obloquy?\r\n\r\nIf we are to deal justly with Roderigo Borgia, we must admit that, in\r\nso far as his concessions to his lusts are concerned, he was a typical\r\nchurchman of his day; neither more nor less--as will presently grow\r\nabundantly clear.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected by some that had such been the case the Pope would\r\nnot have written him such a letter as is here cited. But consider a\r\nmoment the close relations existing between them. Roderigo was the\r\nnephew of the late Pope; in a great measure Pius II owed his election,\r\nas we have seen, to Roderigo’s action in the Conclave. That his interest\r\nin him apart from that was paternal and affectionate is shown in every\r\nline of that letter. And consider further that Roderigo’s companion\r\nis shown by that letter to be equally guilty in so far as the acts\r\nthemselves are to be weighed, guilty in a greater degree when we\r\nremember his seniority and his actual priesthood. Yet to Cardinal\r\nAmmanati the Pope wrote no such admonition. Is not that sufficient proof\r\nthat his admonition of Roderigo was dictated purely by his personal\r\naffection for him?\r\n\r\nIn this same year 1460 was born to Cardinal Roderigo a son--Don Pedro\r\nLuis de Borja--by a spinster (mulier soluta) unnamed. This son was\r\npublicly acknowledged and cared for by the cardinal.\r\n\r\nSeven years later--in 1467--he became the father of a daughter--Girolama\r\nde Borja--by a spinster, whose name again does not transpire. Like Pedro\r\nLuis she too was openly acknowledged by Cardinal Roderigo. It was widely\r\nbelieved that this child’s mother was Madonna Giovanna de’ Catanei, who\r\nsoon became quite openly the cardinal’s mistress, and was maintained by\r\nhim in such state as might have become a maîtresse en titre. But, as we\r\nshall see later, the fact of that maternity of Girolama is doubtful in\r\nthe extreme. It was never established, and it is difficult to understand\r\nwhy not if it were the fact.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Paul II--Pietro Barbo, Cardinal of Venice--had succeeded Pius\r\nII in 1464, and in 1471 the latter was in his turn succeeded by\r\nthe formidable Sixtus IV--Cardinal Francesco Maria della Rovere--a\r\nFranciscan of the lowest origin, who by his energy and talents had\r\nbecome general of his order and had afterwards been raised to the\r\ndignity of the purple.\r\n\r\nIt was Cardinal Roderigo de Lanzol y Borja who, in his official capacity\r\nof Archdeacon of Holy Church, performed the ceremony of coronation and\r\nplaced the triple crown on the head of Pope Sixtus. It is probable that\r\nthis was his last official act as Arch­deacon, for in that same year\r\n1471, at the age of forty, he was ordained priest and consecrated Bishop\r\nof Albano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE REIGNS OF SIXTUS IV AND INNOCENT VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule of Sixtus was as vigorous as it was scandalous. To say--as has\r\nbeen said--that with his succession to St. Peter’s Chair came for the\r\nChurch a still sadder time than that which had preceded it, is not\r\naltogether true. Politically, at least, Sixtus did much to strengthen\r\nthe position of the Holy See and of the Pontificate. He was not long in\r\ngiving the Roman factions a taste of his stern quality. If he employed\r\nunscrupulous means, he employed them against unscrupulous men--on the\r\nsound principle of similia similibus curantur--and to some extent they\r\nwere justified by the ends in view.\r\n\r\nHe found the temporal throne of the Pontiffs tottering when he ascended\r\nit. Stefano Porcaro and his distinguished following already in 1453 had\r\nattempted the overthrow of the pontifical authority, inspired, no doubt,\r\nby the attacks that had been levelled against it by the erudite and\r\ndaring Lorenzo Valla.\r\n\r\nThis Valla was the distinguished translator of Homer, Herodotus, and\r\nThucydides, who more than any one of his epoch advanced the movement of\r\nGreek and Latin learning, which, whilst it had the effect of arresting\r\nthe development of Italian literature, enriched Europe by opening up to\r\nit the sources of ancient erudition, of philosophy, poetry, and literary\r\ntaste. Towards the year 1435 he drifted to the court of Alfonso of\r\nAragon, whose secretary he ultimately became. Some years later he\r\nattacked the Temporal Power and urged the secularization of the States\r\nof the Church. “Ut Papa,” he wrote, “tantum Vicarius Christi sit, et\r\nnon etiam Coesari.” In his De falso credita et ementita Constantini\r\nDonatione, he showed that the decretals of the Donation of Constantine,\r\nupon which rests the Pope’s claim to the Pontifical States, was an\r\nimpudent forgery, that Constantine had never had the power to give,\r\nnor had given, Rome to the Popes, and that they had no right to govern\r\nthere. He backed up this terrible indictment by a round attack upon the\r\nclergy, its general corruption and its practices of simony; and as a\r\nresult he fell into the hands of the Inquisition. There it might have\r\ngone very ill with him but that King Alfonso rescued him from the\r\nclutches of that dread priestly tribunal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he had fired his petard. If a pretext had been wanting to\r\nwarrant the taking up of arms against the Papacy, that pretext Valla had\r\nafforded. Never was the temporal power of the Church in such danger, and\r\nultimately it must inevitably have succumbed but for the coming of so\r\nstrong and unscrupulous a man as Sixtus IV to stamp out the patrician\r\nfactions that were heading the hostile movement.\r\n\r\nHis election, it is generally admitted, was simoniacal; and by simony he\r\nraised the funds necessary for his campaign to reestablish and support\r\nthe papal authority. This simony of his, says Dr. Jacob Burckhardt,\r\n“grew to unheard-of proportions, and extended from the appointment of\r\ncardinals down to the sale of the smallest benefice.”\r\n\r\nHad he employed these means of raising funds for none but the purpose\r\nof putting down the assailants of the Pontificate, a measure of\r\njustification (political if not ecclesiastical) might be argued in his\r\nfavour. Unfortunately, having discovered these ready sources of revenue,\r\nhe continued to exploit them for purposes far less easy to condone.\r\n\r\nAs a nepotist Sixtus was almost unsurpassed in the history of the\r\nPapacy. Four of his nephews and their aggrandizement were the particular\r\nobjects of his attentions, and two of these--as we have already\r\nsaid--Piero and Girolamo Riario, were universally recognized to be his\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nPiero, who was a simple friar of twenty-six years of age at the time\r\nthat his father became Pope, was given the Archbishopric of Florence,\r\nmade Patriarch of Constantinople, and created Cardinal to the title of\r\nSan Sisto, with a revenue of 60,000 crowns.\r\n\r\nWe have it on the word of Cardinal Ammanati(1)--the same gentleman who,\r\nwith Roderigo de Lanzol y Borja made so scandalously merry in de Bichis’\r\ngarden at Siena--that Cardinal Riario’s luxury “exceeded all that had\r\nbeen displayed by our forefathers or that can even be imagined by our\r\ndescendants”; and Macchiavelli tells us(2) that “although of very low\r\norigin and mean rearing, no sooner had he obtained the scarlet hat than\r\nhe displayed a pride and ambition so vast that the Pontificate seemed\r\ntoo small for him, and he gave a feast in Rome which would have appeared\r\nextraordinary even for a king, the expense exceeding 20,000 florins.”\r\n\r\n     1  In a letter to Francesco Gonzaga.\r\n\r\n     2  Istorie Florentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing so much, it is not difficult to understand that in one year or\r\nless he should have dissipated 200,000 florins, and found himself in\r\ndebt to the extent of a further 60,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1473, Sixtus being at the time all but at war with Florence, this\r\nCardinal Riario visited Venice and Milan. In the latter State he was\r\nplanning with Duke Galeazzo Maria that the latter should become King of\r\nLombardy, and then assist him with money and troops to master Rome and\r\nascend the Papal Throne--which, it appears, Sixtus was quite willing\r\nto yield to him--thus putting the Papacy on a hereditary basis like any\r\nother secular State.\r\n\r\nIt is as well, perhaps, that he should have died on his return to Rome\r\nin January of 1474--worn out by his excesses and debaucheries, say some;\r\nof poison administered by the Venetians, say others--leaving a mass of\r\ndebts, contracted in his transactions with the World, the Flesh, and the\r\nDevil, to be cleared up by the Vicar of Christ.\r\n\r\nHis brother Girolamo, meanwhile, had married Caterina Sforza, a natural\r\ndaughter of Duke Galeazzo Maria. She brought him as her dowry the City\r\nof Imola, and in addition to this he received from his Holiness the City\r\nof Forli, to which end the Ordelaffi were dispossessed of it. Here again\r\nwe have a papal attempt to found a family dynasty, and an attempt that\r\nmight have been carried further under circumstances more propitious and\r\nhad not Death come to check their schemes.\r\n\r\nThe only one of the four “nephews” of Sixtus--and to this one was\r\nimputed no nearer kinship--who was destined to make any lasting mark\r\nin history was Giuliano della Rovere. He was raised by his uncle to the\r\npurple with the title of San Pietro in Vincoli, and thirty-two years\r\nlater he was to become Pope (as Julius II). Of him we shall hear much in\r\nthe course of this story.\r\n\r\nUnder the pontificate of Sixtus IV the position and influence of\r\nCardinal Roderigo were greatly increased, for once again the Spanish\r\nCardinal had made the most of his opportunities. As at the election of\r\nPius II, so at the election of Sixtus IV it was Cardinal Roderigo who\r\nled the act of accession which gave the new Pope his tiara, and for\r\nthis act Roderigo--in common with the Cardinals Orsini and Gonzaga who\r\nacceded with him--was richly rewarded and advanced, receiving as his\r\nimmediate guerdon the wealthy Abbey of Subiaco.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, 1470, must have begun the relations between Cardinal\r\nRoderigo and Giovanna Catanei, or Vannozza Catanei, as she is styled in\r\ncontemporary documents--Vannozza being a corruption or abbreviation of\r\nGiovannozza, an affectionate form of Giovanna.\r\n\r\nWho she was, or whence she came, are facts that have never been\r\nascertained. She is generally assumed to have been a Roman; but there\r\nare no obvious grounds for the assumption, her name, for instance,\r\nbeing common to many parts of Italy. And just as we have no sources of\r\ninformation upon her origin, neither have we any elements from which\r\nto paint her portrait. Gregorovius rests the probability that she was\r\nbeautiful upon the known characteristics and fastidious tastes of\r\nthe cardinal. Since it is unthinkable that such a man would have been\r\ncaptivated by an ugly woman or would have been held by a stupid one,\r\nit is fairly reasonable to conclude that she was beautiful and\r\nready-witted.\r\n\r\nAll that we do know of her up to the time of her liaison with Cardinal\r\nRoderigo is that she was born on July 13, 1442, this fact being\r\nascertainable by a simple calculation from the elements afforded by the\r\ninscription on her tomb in Santa Maria del Popolo:\r\n\r\nVix ann. LXXVI m. IV d. XII Objit anno MDXVIII XXVI, Nov.\r\n\r\nAnd again, just as we know nothing of her family origin, neither have we\r\nany evidence of what her circumstances were when she caught the magnetic\r\neye of Cardinal Roderigo de Lanzol y Borja--or Borgia as by now his\r\nname, which had undergone italianization, was more generally spelled.\r\n\r\nInfessura states in his diaries that Roderigo desiring later--as Pope\r\nAlexander VI--to create cardinal his son by her, Cesare Borgia, he\r\ncaused false witness to be borne to the fact that Cesare was the\r\nlegitimate son of one Domenico d’Arignano, to whom he, the Pope, had\r\nin fact married her. Guicciardini(1) makes the same statement, without,\r\nhowever, mentioning name of this d’Arignano.\r\n\r\n     1  Istoria d’Italia.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, bastards were by canon law excluded from the purple, and it is\r\nprobably upon this circumstance that both Infessura and Guicciardini\r\nhave built the assumption that some such means as these had been adopted\r\nto circumvent the law, and--as so often happens in chronicles concerning\r\nthe Borgias--the assumption is straightway stated as a fact. But\r\nthere were other ways of circumventing awkward commandments, and,\r\nunfortunately for the accuracy of these statements of Infessura and\r\nGuicciardini, another way was taken in this instance. As early as\r\n1480, Pope Sixtus IV had granted Cesare Borgia--in a Bull dated October\r\n1(1)--dispensation from proving the legitimacy of his birth. This\r\nentirely removed the necessity for any such subsequent measures as those\r\nwhich are suggested by these chroniclers.\r\n\r\n     1  See the supplement to the Appendix of Thuasne’s edition\r\n     of Burchard’s Diarium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, had Cardinal Roderigo desired to fasten the paternity of\r\nCesare on another, there was ready to his hand Vannozza’s actual\r\nhusband, Giorgio della Croce.(2) When exactly this man became her\r\nhusband is not to be ascertained. All that we know is that he was so in\r\n1480, and that she was living with him in that year in a house in Piazza\r\nPizzo di Merlo (now Piazza Sforza Cesarini) not far from the house on\r\nBanchi Vecchi which Cardinal Roderigo, as Vice-Chancellor, had converted\r\ninto a palace for himself, and a palace so sumptuous as to excite the\r\nwonder of that magnificent age.\r\n\r\n     2  D’Arignano is as much a fiction as the rest of\r\n     Infessura’s story.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Giorgio della Croce was a Milanese, under the protection of\r\nCardinal Roderigo, who had obtained for him a post at the Vatican as\r\napostolic secretary. According to some, he married him to Vannozza in\r\norder to afford her an official husband and thus cloak his own relations\r\nwith her. It is an assumption which you will hesitate to accept. If we\r\nknow our Cardinal Roderigo at all, he was never the man to pursue his\r\npleasures in a hole-and-corner fashion, nor one to bethink him of a\r\ncloak for his amusements. Had he but done so, scandalmongers would\r\nhave had less to fasten upon in their work of playing havoc with his\r\nreputation. What is far more likely is that della Croce owed Cardinal\r\nRoderigo’s protection and the appointment as apostolic secretary to his\r\nown complacency in the matter of his wife’s relations with the splendid\r\nprelate. However we look at it, the figure cut in this story by della\r\nCroce is not heroic.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1474 and 1476, Vannozza bore Roderigo two sons, Cesare\r\nBorgia (afterwards Cardinal of Valencia and Duke of Valentinois), the\r\ncentral figure of our story, and Giovanni Borgia (afterwards Duke of\r\nGandia).\r\n\r\nLucrezia Borgia, we know from documentary evidence before us, was born\r\non April 19, 1479.\r\n\r\nBut there is a mystery about the precise respective ages of Vannozza’s\r\ntwo eldest sons, and we fear that at this time of day it has become\r\nimpossible to establish beyond reasonable doubt which was the firstborn;\r\nand this in spite of the documents discovered by Gregorovius and his\r\nassertion that they remove all doubt and enable him definitely to assert\r\nthat Giovanni was born in 1474 and Cesare in 1476.\r\n\r\nLet us look at these documents. They are letters from ambassadors to\r\ntheir masters; probably correct, and the more credible since they\r\nhappen to agree and corroborate one another; still, not so utterly and\r\nabsolutely reliable as to suffice to remove the doubts engendered by the\r\nno less reliable documents whose evidence contradicts them.\r\n\r\nThe first letters quoted by Gregorovius are from the ambassador\r\nGianandrea Boccaccio to his master, the Duke of Ferrara, in 1493. In\r\nthese he mentions Cesare Borgia as being sixteen to seventeen years of\r\nage at the time. But the very manner of writing--“sixteen to seventeen\r\nyears”--is a common way of vaguely suggesting age rather than positively\r\nstating it. So we may pass that evidence over, as of secondary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nNext is a letter from Gerardo Saraceni to the Duke of Ferrara, dated\r\nOctober 26, 1501, and it is more valuable, claiming as it does to be the\r\nrelation of something which his Holiness told the writer. It is in the\r\npost-scriptum that this ambassador says: “The Pope gave me to understand\r\nthat the said Duchess [Lucrezia Borgia] will complete twenty-two years\r\nof age next April, and at that same time the Duke of Romagna will\r\ncomplete his twenty-sixth year.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Facendomi intendere the epsa Duchessa é di etá di anni ventidui, li\r\nquali finiranno a questo Aprile; in el qual tempo anche lo Illmo. Duca\r\ndi Romagna fornirá anni ventisei.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis certainly fixes the year of Cesare’s birth as 1476; but we are\r\nto remember that Saraceni is speaking of something that the Pope had\r\nrecently told him; exactly how recently does not transpire. An error\r\nwould easily be possible in so far as the age of Cesare is concerned.\r\nIn so far as the age of Lucrezia is concerned, an error is not only\r\npossible, but has actually been committed by Saraceni. At least the age\r\ngiven in his letter is wrong by one year, as we know by a legal document\r\ndrawn up in February of 1491--Lucrezia’s contract of marriage with Don\r\nJuan Cherubin de Centelles.(2)\r\n\r\n\r\n  2  A contract never executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to this protocol in old Spanish, dated February 26, 1491,\r\nLucrezia completed her twelfth year on April 19, 1491,(3) which\r\ndefinitely and positively gives us the date of her birth as April 19,\r\n1479.\r\n\r\n\r\n  3  “Item mes attenent que dita Dona Lucretia a XVIIII de Abril prop.\r\nvinent entrará in edat de dotze anys.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA quite extraordinary error is that made by Gregorovius when he\r\nsays that Lucrezia Borgia was born on April 18, 1480, extraordinary\r\nconsidering that he made it apparently with this very protocol under his\r\neyes, and cites it, in fact (Document IV in the Appendix to his Lucrezia\r\nBorgia) as his authority.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to Cesare and Giovanni, there is yet another\r\nevidence quoted by Gregorovius in support of his contention that the\r\nlatter was the elder and born in 1474; but it is of the same nature and\r\nof no more, nor less, value than those already mentioned.\r\n\r\nWorthy of more consideration in view of their greater official and\r\nlegal character are the Ossuna documents, given in the Supplement of the\r\nAppendix in Thuasne’s edition of Burchard’s Diary, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) October 1, 1480.--A Bull from Sixtus IV, already mentioned,\r\ndispensing Cesare from proving his legitimacy. In this he is referred to\r\nas in his sixth year--“in sexto tuo aetatis anno.”\r\n\r\nThis, assuming Boccaccio’s letter to be correct in the matter of April\r\nbeing the month of Cesare’s birth, fixes the year of his birth as 1475.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) August 16, 1482.--A Bull of Sixtus IV, appointing Roderigo Borgia\r\nadministrator of Cesare’s benefices. In this he is mentioned as being\r\nseven years of age (i.e., presumably in his eighth year), which again\r\ngives us his birth-year as 1475.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) September 12, 1484.--A Bull of Sixtus IV, appointing Cesare\r\ntreasurer of the Church of Carthage. In this he is mentioned as in his\r\nninth year--“in nono tuo aetatis anno.” This is at variance with the\r\nother two, and gives us 1476 as the year of his birth.\r\n\r\nTo these evidences, conflicting as they are, may be added Burchard’s\r\nmention in his diary under date of September 12, 1491, that Cesare was\r\nthen seventeen years of age. This would make him out to have been born\r\nin 1474.\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly the matter cannot definitely be settled upon such evidence as we\r\nhave. All that we can positively assert is that he was born between the\r\nyears 1474 and 1476, and we cannot, we think, do better for the purposes\r\nof this story than assume his birth-year to have been 1475.\r\n\r\nWe know that between those same years, or in one or the other of them,\r\nwas born Giovanni Borgia; but just as the same confusion prevails with\r\nregard to his exact age, so is it impossible to determine with any\r\nfinality whether he was Cesare’s junior or senior.\r\n\r\nThe one document that appears to us to be the most important in this\r\nconnection is that of the inscription on their mother’s tomb. This runs:\r\n\r\nFAUSTIAE CATHANAE, CESARE VALENTINAE, JOHANNAE CANDIAE, JUFFREDO\r\nSCYLATII, ET LUCRETIA FERRARIAE DUCIB. FILIIS NOBILI PROBITATE INSIGNI,\r\nRELIGIONE EXIMIA, ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Giovanni was, as is claimed, the eldest of her children, why does his\r\nname come second? If Cesare was her second son, why does his name take\r\nthe first place on that inscription?\r\n\r\nIt has been urged that if Cesare was the elder of these two, he, and not\r\nGiovanni, would have succeeded to the Duchy of Gandia on the death of\r\nPedro Luis--Cardinal Roderigo’s eldest son, by an unknown mother. But\r\nthat does not follow inevitably; for it is to be remembered that Cesare\r\nwas already destined for an ecclesiastical career, and it may well be\r\nthat his father was reluctant to change his plans.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the turbulent reign of Sixtus IV went on, until his ambition\r\nto increase his dominions had the result of plunging the whole of Italy\r\ninto war.\r\n\r\nLorenzo de’Medici had thwarted the Pope’s purposes in Romagna, coming to\r\nthe assistance of Città di Castello when this was attacked in the Pope’s\r\ninterest by the warlike Giuliano della Rovere. To avenge himself for\r\nthis, and to remove a formidable obstacle to his family’s advancement,\r\nthe Pope inspired the Pazzi conspiracy against the lives of the famous\r\nmasters of Florence. The conspiracy failed; for although Giuliano\r\nde’Medici fell stabbed to the heart--before Christ’s altar, and at the\r\nvery moment of the elevation of the Host--Lorenzo escaped with slight\r\nhurt, and, by the very risk to which he had been exposed, rallied the\r\nFlorentines to him more closely than ever.\r\n\r\nOpen war was the only bolt remaining in the papal quiver, and open\r\nwar he declared, preluding it by a Bull of Excommunication against the\r\nFlorentines. Naples took sides with the Pope. Venice and Milan came to\r\nthe support of Florence, whereupon Milan’s attentions were diverted to\r\nher own affairs, Genoa being cunningly set in revolt against her.\r\n\r\nIn 1480 a peace was patched up; but it was short-lived. A few months\r\nlater war flared out again from the Holy See, against Florence this\r\ntime, and on the pretext of its having joined the Venetians against\r\nthe Pope in the late war. A complication now arose, created by the\r\nVenetians, who seized the opportunity to forward their own ambitions and\r\nincrease their territories on the mainland, and upon a pretext of the\r\npettiest themselves declared war upon Ferrara. Genoa and some minor\r\ntyrannies were drawn into the quarrel on the one side, whilst on the\r\nother Florence, Naples, Mantua, Milan, and Bologna stood by Ferrara.\r\nWhilst the papal forces were holding in check the Neapolitans who\r\nsought to pass north to aid Ferrara, whilst the Roman Campagna was being\r\nharassed by the Colonna, and Milan was engaged with Genoa, the Venetians\r\ninvested Ferrara, forced her to starvation and to yielding-point.\r\nThereupon the Pope, perceiving the trend of affairs, and that the only\r\nlikely profit to be derived from the campaign would lie with Venice,\r\nsuddenly changed sides that he might avoid a contingency so far removed\r\nfrom all his aims.\r\n\r\nHe made a treaty with Naples, and permitted the Neapolitan army passage\r\nthrough his territories, of which they availed themselves to convey\r\nsupplies to Ferrara and neutralize the siege. At the same time the Pope\r\nexcommunicated the Venetians, and urged all Italy to make war upon them.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion the campaign dragged on to every one’s disadvantage and\r\nwithout any decisive battle fought, until at last the peace of Bagnolo\r\nwas concluded in August of 1484, and the opposing armies withdrew from\r\nFerrara.\r\n\r\nThe news of it literally killed Sixtus. When the ambassadors declared\r\nto him the terms of the treaty he was thrown into a violent rage, and\r\ndeclared the peace to be at once shameful and humiliating. The gout from\r\nwhich he suffered flew to his heart, and on the following day--August\r\n12, 1484--he died.\r\n\r\nTwo things he did during his reign to the material advantage of\r\nthe Church, however much he may have neglected the spiritual. He\r\nstrengthened her hold upon her temporal possessions and he enriched the\r\nVatican by the addition of the Sistine Chapel. For the decoration\r\nof this he procured the best Tuscan talent of his day--and of many\r\ndays--and brought Alessandro Filipeppi (Botticelli), Pietro Vannuccio\r\n(Il Perugino), and Domenico Bigordi (IL Ghirlandajo) from Florence to\r\nadorn its walls with their frescoes.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The glory of the Sistine Chapel, however, is Michelangelo’s “Last\r\nJudgement,” which was added later, in the reign of Pope Julius II\r\n(Giuliano della Rovere).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the reign of Pope Sixtus, Cardinal Roderigo’s\r\nfamily had suffered a loss and undergone an increase.\r\n\r\nIn 1481 Vannozza bore him another son--Giuffredo Borgia, and in the\r\nfollowing year died his eldest son (by an unknown mother) Pedro Luis de\r\nBorgia, who had reached the age of twenty-two and was betrothed at the\r\ntime of his decease to the Princess Maria d’Aragona.\r\n\r\nIn January of that same year, 1482, Cardinal Roderigo had married his\r\ndaughter Girolama--now aged fifteen--to Giovanni Andrea Cesarini, the\r\nscion of a patrician Roman house. The alliance strengthened the bonds of\r\ngood feeling which for some considerable time had prevailed between the\r\ntwo families. Unfortunately the young couple were not destined to many\r\nyears of life together, as in 1483 both died.\r\n\r\nOf Cesare all that we know at this period is what we learn from the\r\nPapal Bulls conferring several benefices upon him. In July 1482 he was\r\ngranted the revenues from the prebendals and canonries of Valencia; in\r\nthe following month he was appointed Canon of Valencia and apostolic\r\nnotary. In April 1484 he was made Provost of Alba, and in September\r\nof the same year treasurer of the Church of Carthage. No doubt he was\r\nliving with his mother, his brothers, and his sister at the house in the\r\nPiazza Pizzo di Merlo, where an ample if not magnificent establishment\r\nwas maintained.\r\n\r\nBy this time Cardinal Roderigo’s wealth and power had grown to\r\nstupendous proportions, and he lived in a splendour well worthy of his\r\nlofty rank. He was now fifty-three years of age, still retaining the air\r\nand vigour of a man in his very prime, which, no doubt, he owed as much\r\nas to anything to his abstemious and singularly sparing table-habits. He\r\nderived a stupendous income from his numerous abbeys in Italy and\r\nSpain, his three bishoprics of Valencia, Porto, and Carthage, and\r\nhis ecclesiastical offices, among which the Vice-Chancellorship alone\r\nyielded him annually eight thousand florins.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The gold florin, ducat, or crown was equal to ten shillings of our\r\npresent money, and had a purchasing power of five times that amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolterra refers with wonder to the abundance of his plate, to his\r\npearls, his gold embroideries, and his books, the splendid equipment of\r\nhis beds, the trappings of his horses, and other similar furnishings in\r\ngold, in silver, and in silk. In short, he was the wealthiest prince of\r\nthe Church of his day, and he lived with a magnificence worthy of a king\r\nor of the Pope himself.\r\n\r\nOf the actual man, Volterra, writing in 1586, says: “He is of a spirit\r\ncapable of anything, and of a great intelligence. A ready speaker,\r\nand of distinction, notwithstanding his indifferent literary culture;\r\nnaturally astute, and of marvellous talent in the conduct of affairs.”\r\n\r\nIn the year in which Volterra wrote of Cardinal Roderigo in such terms\r\nVannozza was left a widow by the death of Giorgio della Croce. Her\r\nwidowhood was short, however, for in the same year--on June 6--she took\r\na second husband, possibly at the instance of Roderigo Borgia, who\r\ndid not wish to leave her unprotected; that, at least, is the general\r\ninference, although there is very little evidence upon which to base it.\r\nThis second husband was Carlo Canale, a Mantovese scholar who had served\r\nCardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the capacity of chamberlain, and who had\r\ncome to Rome on the death of his patron.\r\n\r\nThe marriage contract shows that by this time Vannozza had removed her\r\nresidence to Piazza Branchis. In addition to this she had by this\r\ntime acquired a villa with its beautiful gardens and vine­yards in the\r\nSuburra near S. Pietro in Vincoli. She is also known to have been the\r\nproprietor of an inn--the Albergo del Leone--in Via del Orso, opposite\r\nthe Torre di Nona, for she figures with della Croce in a contract\r\nregarding a lease of it in 1483.\r\n\r\nWith her entrance into second nuptials, her relations with Cardinal\r\nRoderigo came to an end, and his two children by her, then in\r\nRome--Lucrezia and Giuffredo--went to take up their residence with\r\nAdriana Orsini (née de Mila) at the Orsini Palace on Monte Giordano. She\r\nwas a cousin of Roderigo’s, and the widow of Lodovico Orsini, by whom\r\nshe had a son, Orso Orsini, who from early youth had been betrothed to\r\nGiulia Farnese, the daughter of a patrician family, still comparatively\r\nobscure, but destined through this very girl to rise to conspicuous\r\neminence.\r\n\r\nFor her surpassing beauty this Giulia Farnese has been surnamed La\r\nBella--and as Giulia La Bella was she known in her day--and she has been\r\nimmortalized by Pinturicchio and Guglielmo della Porta. She sat to the\r\nformer as a model for his Madonna in the Borgia Tower of the Vatican,\r\nand to the latter for the statue of Truth which adorns the tomb of her\r\nbrother Alessandro Farnese, who became Pope Paul III.\r\n\r\nHere in Adriana Orsini’s house, where his daughter Lucrezia was being\r\neducated, Cardinal Roderigo, now at the mature age of some six-and-fifty\r\nyears, made the acquaintance and became enamoured of this beautiful\r\ngolden-headed Giulia, some forty years his junior. To the fact that she\r\npresently became his mistress--somewhere about the same time that\r\nshe became Orso Orsini’s wife--is due the sudden rise of the House of\r\nFarnese. This began with her handsome, dissolute brother Alessandro’s\r\nelevation to the purple by her lover, and grew to vast proportions\r\nduring his subsequent and eminently scandalous occupation of the Papal\r\nThrone as Paul III.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1490 Lucrezia was the only one of Roderigo’s children by\r\nVannozza who remained in Rome.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Borgia was in Spain, whither he had gone on the death of his\r\nbrother Pedro Luis, to take posession of the Duchy of Gandia, which the\r\npower of his father’s wealth and vast influence at the Valencian Court\r\nhad obtained for that same Pedro Luis. To this Giovanni now succeeded.\r\n\r\nCesare Borgia--now aged fifteen--had for some two years been studying\r\nhis humanities in an atmosphere of Latinity at the Sapienza of Perugia.\r\nThere, if we are to believe the praises of him uttered by Pompilio, he\r\nwas already revealing his unusual talents and a precocious wit. In\r\nthe preface of the Syllabica on the art of Prosody dedicated to him by\r\nPompilio, the latter hails him as the hope and ornament of the Hous of\r\nBorgia--“Borgiae familiae spes et decus.”\r\n\r\nFrom Perugia he was moved in 1491 to the famous University of Pisa, a\r\ncollege frequented by the best of Italy. For preceptor he had Giovanni\r\nVera of Arcilla, a Spanish gentleman who was later created a cardinal by\r\nCesare’s father. There in Pisa Cesare maintained an establishment of a\r\nmagnificence in keeping with his father’s rank and with the example set\r\nhim by that same father.\r\n\r\nIt was Cardinal Roderigo’s wish that Cesare should follow an\r\necclesiastical career; and the studies of canon law which he pursued\r\nunder Filippo Decis, the most rated lecturer on canon law of his day,\r\nwere such as peculiarly to fit him for that end and for the highest\r\nhonours the Church might have to bestow upon him later. At the age of\r\nseventeen, while still at Pisa, he was appointed prothonotary of the\r\nChurch and preconized Bishop of Pampeluna.\r\n\r\nSixtus IV died, as we have seen, in August 1482. The death of a Pope\r\nwas almost invariably the signal for disturbances in Rome, and they\r\ncertainly were not wanting on this occasion. The Riario palaces were\r\nstormed and looted, and Girolamo Riario--the Pope’s “nepot”--threw\r\nhimself into the castle of Sant’ Angelo with his forces.\r\n\r\nThe Orsini and Colonna were in arms, “so that in a few days\r\nincendiarism, robbery, and murder raged in several parts of the city.\r\nThe cardinals besought the Count to surrender the castle to the Sacred\r\nCollege, withdraw his troops, and deliver Rome from the fear of his\r\nforces; and he, that he might win the favour of the future Pope, obeyed,\r\nand withdrew to Imola.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Macchiavelli, Istorie Fiorentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinals, having thus contrived to restore some semblance of order,\r\nproceeded to the creation of a new Pontiff, and a Genoese, Giovanni\r\nBattista Cibo, Cardinal of Malfetta, was elected and took the name of\r\nInnocent VIII.\r\n\r\nAgain, as in the case of Sixtus, there is no lack of those who charge\r\nthis Pontiff with having obtained his election by simony. The Cardinals\r\nGiovanni d’ Aragona (brother to the King of Naples) and Ascanio Sforza\r\n(brother of Lodovico, Duke of Milan) are said to have disposed of their\r\nvotes in the most open and shameless manner, practically putting them\r\nup for sale to the highest bidder. Italy rang with the scandal of it, we\r\nare told.\r\n\r\nUnder Innocent’s lethargic rule the Church again began to lose much of\r\nthe vigour with which Sixtus had inspired it. If the reign of Sixtus\r\nhad been scandalous, infinitely worse was that of Innocent--a sordid,\r\ngrasping sensualist, without even the one redeeming virtue of strength\r\nthat had been his predecessor’s. Nepotism had characterized many\r\nprevious pontificates; open paternity was to characterize his, for he\r\nwas the first Pope who, in flagrant violation of canon law, acknowledged\r\nhis children for his own. He proceeded to provide for some seven\r\nbastards, and that provision appears to have been the only aim and scope\r\nof his pontificate.\r\n\r\nNot content with raising money by the sale of preferments, Innocent\r\nestablished a traffic in indulgences, the like of which had never been\r\nseen before. In the Rome of his day you might, had you the money, buy\r\nanything, from a cardinal’s hat to a pardon for the murder of your\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous of his bastards was Francesco Cibo--conspicuous\r\nchiefly for the cupidity which distinguished him as it distinguished the\r\nPope his father. For the rest he was a poor-spirited fellow who sorely\r\ndisappointed Lorenzo de’Medici, whose daughter Maddalena he received\r\nin marriage. Lorenzo had believed that, backed by the Pope’s influence,\r\nFrancesco would establish for himself a dynasty in Romagna. But father\r\nand son were alike too invertebrate--the one to inspire, the other to\r\nexecute any such designs as had already been attempted by the nepots of\r\nCalixtus III and Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\nUnder the weak and scandalous rule of Innocent VIII Rome appears to\r\nhave been abandoned to the most utter lawlessness. Anarchy, robbery, and\r\nmurder preyed upon the city. No morning dawned without revealing corpses\r\nin the streets; and if by chance the murderer was caught, there was\r\npardon for him if he could afford to buy it, or Tor di Nona and the\r\nhangman’s noose if he could not.\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful that when at last Innocent VIII died Infessura\r\nshould have blessed the day that freed the world of such a monster.\r\n\r\nBut his death did not happen until 1492. A feeble old man, he had become\r\nsubject to lethargic or cataleptic trances, which had several times\r\nalready deceived those in attendance into believing him dead. He grew\r\nweaker and weaker, and it became impossible to nourish him upon anything\r\nbut woman’s milk. Towards the end came, Infessura tells us, a Hebrew\r\nphysician who claimed to have a prescription by which he could save the\r\nPope’s life. For his infusion(1) he needed young human blood, and to\r\nobtain it he took three boys of the age of ten, and gave them a ducat\r\napiece for as much as he might require of them. Unfortunately he took so\r\nmuch that the three boys incontinently died of his phlebotomy, and the\r\nHebrew was obliged to take to flight to save his own life, for the Pope,\r\nbeing informed of what had taken place, execrated the deed and ordered\r\nthe physician’s arrest. “Judeus quidem aufugit, et Papa sanatus not\r\nest,” concludes Infessura.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The silly interpretation of this afforded by later writers, that this\r\nphysician attempted transfusion of blood--silly, because unthinkable in\r\nan age which knew nothing of the circulation of the blood--has already\r\nbeen exploded.\r\n\r\nInnocent VIII breathed his last on July 25, 1492.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. ALEXANDER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies connected with the obsequies of Pope Innocent VIII\r\nlasted--as prescribed--nine days; they were concluded on August 5, 1492,\r\nand, says Infessura naïvely, “sic finita fuit eius memoria.”\r\n\r\nThe Sacred College consisted at the time of twenty-seven cardinals, four\r\nof whom were absent at distant sees and unable to reach Rome in time\r\nfor the immuring of the Conclave. The twenty-three present were, in the\r\norder of their seniority: Roderigo Borgia, Oliviero Caraffa, Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere, Battista Zeno, Giovanni Michieli, Giorgio Costa, Girolamo\r\ndella Rovere, Paolo Fregosi, Domenico della Rovere, Giovanni dei\r\nConti, Giovanni Giacomo Sclafetani, Lorenzo Cibo, Ardicino della Porta,\r\nAntoniotto Pallavicino, Maffeo Gerardo, Francesco Piccolomini, Raffaele\r\nRiario, Giovanni Battista Savelli, Giovanni Colonna, Giovanni Orsini,\r\nAscanio Maria Sforza, Giovanni de’Medici, and Francesco Sanseverino.\r\n\r\nOn August 6 they assembled in St. Peter’s to hear the Sacred Mass of the\r\nHoly Ghost, which was said by Giuliano della Rovere on the tomb of the\r\nPrince of the Apostles, and to listen to the discourse “Pro eligendo\r\nPontefice,” delivered by the learned and eloquent Bishop of Carthage.\r\nThereafter the Cardinals swore upon the Gospels faithfully to observe\r\ntheir trust, and thereupon the Conclave was immured.\r\n\r\nAccording to the dispatches of Valori, the Ferrarese ambassador in Rome,\r\nit was expected that either the Cardinal of Naples (Oliviero Caraffa)\r\nor the Cardinal of Lisbon (Giorgio Costa) would be elected to the\r\nPontificate; and according to the dispatch of Cavalieri the ambassador\r\nof Modena, the King of France had deposited 200,000 ducats with a Roman\r\nbanker to forward the election of Giuliano della Rovere. Nevertheless,\r\nearly on the morning of August 11 it was announced that Roderigo Borgia\r\nwas elected Pope, and we have it on the word of Valori that the election\r\nwas unanimous, for he wrote on the morrow to the Council of Eight (the\r\nSignory of Florence) that after long contention Alexander VI was created\r\n“omnium consensum--ne li manco un solo voto.”\r\n\r\nThe subject of this election is one with which we rarely find an author\r\ndealing temperately or with a proper and sane restraint. To vituperate\r\nin superlatives seems common to most who have taken in hand this and\r\nother episodes in the history of the Borgias. Every fresh writer who\r\ncomes to the task appears to be mainly inspired by a desire to emulate\r\nhis forerunners, allowing his pen to riot zestfully in the accumulation\r\nof scandalous matter, and seeking to increase if possible its lurid\r\nquality by a degree or two. As a rule there is not even an attempt made\r\nto put forward evidence in substantiation of anything that is alleged.\r\nWild and sweeping statement takes the place that should be held by calm\r\ndeduction and reasoned comment.\r\n\r\n“He was the worst Pontiff that ever filled St. Peter’s Chair,” is one\r\nof these sweeping statements, culled from the pages of an able, modern,\r\nItalian author, whose writings, sound in all that concerns other\r\nmatters, are strewn with the most foolish extravagances and flagrant\r\ninaccuracies in connection with Alexander VI and his family.\r\n\r\nTo say of him, as that writer says, that “he was the worst Pontiff\r\nthat ever filled St. Peter’s Chair,” can only be justified by an utter\r\nignorance of papal history. You have but to compare him calmly and\r\nhonestly--your mind stripped of preconceptions--with the wretched\r\nand wholly contemptible Innocent VIII whom he succeeded, or with the\r\nlatter’s precursor, the terrible Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\nThat he was better than these men, morally or ecclesiastically, is\r\nnot to be pretended; that he was worse--measuring achievement by\r\nopportunity--is strenuously to be denied. For the rest, that he was\r\ninfinitely more gifted and infinitely more a man of affairs is not to be\r\ngainsaid by any impartial critic.\r\n\r\nIf we take him out of the background of history in which he is set, and\r\njudge him singly and individually, we behold a man who, as a churchman\r\nand Christ’s Vicar, fills us with horror and loathing, as a scandalous\r\nexception from what we are justified in supposing from his office must\r\nhave been the rule. Therefore, that he may be judged by the standard of\r\nhis own time if he is to be judged at all, if we are even to attempt to\r\nunderstand him, have we given a sketch of the careers of those Popes who\r\nimmediately preceded him, with whom as Vice-Chancellor he was intimately\r\nassociated, and whose examples were the only papal examples that he\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThat this should justify his course we do not pretend. A good churchman\r\nin his place would have bethought him of his duty to the Master whose\r\nVicar he was, and would have aimed at the sorely needed reform. But we\r\nare not concerned to study him as a good churchman. It is by no means\r\nclear that we are concerned to study him as a churchman at all. The\r\nPapacy had by this time become far less of an ecclesiastical than a\r\npolitical force; the weapons of the Church were there, but they were\r\nbeing employed for the furtherance not of churchly, but of worldly aims.\r\nIf the Pontiffs in the pages of this history remembered or evoked their\r\nspiritual authority, it was but to employ it as an instrument for the\r\nadvancement of their temporal schemes. And personal considerations\r\nentered largely into these.\r\n\r\nSelf-aggrandizement, insufferable in a cleric, is an ambition not\r\naltogether unpardonable in a temporal prince; and if Alexander aimed at\r\nself-aggrandizement and at the founding of a permanent dynasty for\r\nhis family, he did not lack examples in the careers of those among his\r\npredecessors with whom he had been associated.\r\n\r\nThat the Papacy was Christ’s Vicarage was a fact that had long since\r\nbeen obscured by the conception that the Papacy was a kingdom of this\r\nworld. In striving, then, for worldly eminence by every means in his\r\npower, Alexander is no more blameworthy than any other. What, then,\r\nremains? The fact that he succeeded better than any of his forerunners.\r\nBut are we on that account to select him for the special object of our\r\nvituperation? The Papacy had tumbled into a slough of materialism in\r\nwhich it was to wallow even after the Reformation had given it pause\r\nand warning. Under what obligation was Alexander VI, more than any other\r\nPope, to pull it out of that slough? As he found it, so he carried it\r\non, as much a self-seeker, as much a worldly prince, as much a family\r\nman and as little a churchman as any of those who had gone immediately\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nBy the outrageous discrepancy between the Papacy’s professed and actual\r\naims it was fast becoming an object of execration, and it is Alexander’s\r\nmisfortune that, coming when he did, he has remained as the type of his\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe mighty of this world shall never want for detractors. The mean and\r\ninsignificant, writhing under the consciousness of his shortcomings,\r\nministers to his self-love by vilifying the great that he may lessen\r\nthe gap between himself and them. To achieve greatness is to achieve\r\nenemies. It is to excite envy; and as envy no seed can raise up such a\r\ncrop of hatred.\r\n\r\nDoes this need labouring? Have we not abundant instances about us of the\r\nvulgar tittle-tattle and scandalous unfounded gossip which, born Heaven\r\nalone knows on what back-stairs or in what servants’ hall, circulates\r\ncurrently to the detriment of the distinguished in every walk of\r\nlife? And the more conspicuously great the individual, the greater\r\nthe incentive to slander him, for the interest of the slander is\r\ncommensurate with the eminence of the personage assailed.\r\n\r\nSuch to a great extent is the case of Alexander VI. He was too powerful\r\nfor the stomachs of many of his contemporaries, and he and his son\r\nCesare had a way of achieving their ends. Since that could not be\r\ndenied, it remained to inveigh loudly against the means adopted; and\r\nwith pious uplifting of hands and eyes, to cry, “Shame!” and “Horror!”\r\n and “The like has never been heard of!” in wilful blindness to what had\r\nbeen happening at the Vatican for generations.\r\n\r\nLater writers take up the tale of it. It is a fine subject about\r\nwhich to make phrases, and the passion for phrase-making will at times\r\noutweigh the respect for truth. Thus Villari with his “the worst Pontiff\r\nthat ever filled St. Peter’s Chair,” and again, elsewhere, echoing what\r\nmany a writer has said before him from Guicciardini downwards, in\r\nutter and diametric opposition to the true facts of the case: “The\r\nannouncement of his election was received throughout Italy with\r\nuniversal dismay.” To this he adds the ubiquitous story of King\r\nFerrante’s bursting into tears at the news--“though never before known\r\nto weep for the death of his own children.”\r\n\r\nLet us pause a moment to contemplate the grief the Neapolitan King. What\r\npicture is evoked in your minds by that statement of his bursting into\r\ntears at Alexander’s election? We see--do we not?--a pious, noble soul,\r\nhorror-stricken at the sight of the Papacy’s corruption; a truly sublime\r\nfigure, whose tears will surely stand to his credit in heaven; a great\r\nheart breaking; a venerable head bowed down with lofty, righteous grief,\r\nweeping over the grave of Christian hopes. Such surely is the image we\r\nare meant to see by Guicciardini and his many hollow echoers.\r\n\r\nTurn we now for corroboration of that noble picture to the history of\r\nthis same Ferrante. A shock awaits us. We find, in this bastard of\r\nthe great and brilliant Alfonso a cruel, greedy, covetous monster, so\r\ntreacherous and so fiendishly brutal that we are compelled to extend\r\nhim the charity of supposing him to be something less than sane. Let us\r\nconsider but one of his characteristics. He loved to have his enemies\r\nunder his own supervision, and he kept them so--the living ones caged\r\nand guarded, the dead ones embalmed and habited as in life; and this\r\ncollection of mummies was his pride and delight. More, and worse could\r\nwe tell you of him. But--ex pede, Herculem.\r\n\r\nThis man shed tears we are told. Not another word. It is left to our\r\nimagination to paint for us a picture of this weeping; it is left to us\r\nto conclude that these precious tears were symbolical of the grief of\r\nItaly herself; that the catastrophe that provoked them must have been\r\nterrible indeed.\r\n\r\nBut now that we know what manner of man was this who wept, see how\r\ndifferent is the inference that we may draw from his sorrow. Can we\r\nstill imagine it--as we are desired to do--to have sprung from a lofty,\r\nChristian piety? Let us track those tears to their very source, and we\r\nshall find it to be compounded of rage and fear.\r\n\r\nFerrante saw trouble ahead of him with Lodovico Sforza, concerning a\r\nmatter which shall be considered in the next chapter, and not at all\r\nwould it suit him at such a time that such a Pope as Alexander--who, he\r\nhad every reason to suppose, would be on the side of Lodovico--should\r\nrule in Rome.\r\n\r\nSo he had set himself, by every means in his power, to oppose Roderigo’s\r\nelection. His rage at the news that all his efforts had been vain,\r\nhis fear of a man of Roderigo’s mettle, and his undoubted dread of\r\nthe consequences to himself of his frustrated opposition of that man’s\r\nelection, may indeed have loosened the tears of this Ferrante who had\r\nnot even wept at the death of his own children. We say “may” advisedly;\r\nfor the matter, from beginning to end, is one of speculation. If we\r\nleave it for the realm of fact, we have to ask--Were there any tears\r\nat all? Upon what authority rests the statement of the Florentine\r\nhistorian? What, in fact, does he say?\r\n\r\n“It is well known that the King of Naples, for all that in public he\r\ndissembled the pain it caused him, signified to the queen, his\r\nwife, with tears--which were Unusual in him even on the death of his\r\nchildren--that a Pope had been created who would be most pernicious to\r\nItaly.”\r\n\r\nSo that, when all is said, Ferrante shed his kingly tears to his wife\r\nin private, and to her in private he delivered his opinion of the new\r\nPontiff. How, then, came Guicciardini to know of the matter? True, he\r\nsays, “It is well known”--meaning that he had those tears upon hearsay.\r\nIt is, of course, possible that Ferrante’s queen may have repeated what\r\npassed between herself and the king; but that would surely have been in\r\ncontravention of the wishes of her husband, who had, be it remembered,\r\n“dissembled his grief in public.” And Ferrante does not impress one\r\nas the sort of husband whose wishes his wife would be bold enough to\r\ncontravene.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that upon no better authority than this should these\r\nprecious tears of Ferrante’s have been crystallized in history.\r\n\r\nIf this trivial instance has been dealt with at such length it is\r\nbecause, for one reason, it is typical of the foundation of so many\r\nof the Borgia legends, and, for another, because when history has been\r\ncarefully sifted for evidence of the “universal dismay with which the\r\nelection of Roderigo Borgia was received” King Ferrante’s is the only\r\ncase of dismay that comes through the mesh at all. Therefore was it\r\nexpedient to examine it minutely.\r\n\r\nThat “universal dismay”--like the tears of Ferrante--rests upon the word\r\nof Guicciardini. He says that “men were filled with dread and horror by\r\nthis election, because it had been effected by such evil ways [con arte\r\nsi brutte]; and no less because the nature and condition of the person\r\nelected were largely known to many.”\r\n\r\nGuicciardini is to be read with the greatest caution and reserve when he\r\ndeals with Rome. His bias against, and his enmity of, the Papacy are as\r\nobvious as they are notorious, and in his endeavours to bring it as much\r\nas possible into discredit he does not even spare his generous patrons,\r\nthe Medicean Popes--Leo X and Clement VII. If he finds it impossible to\r\nrestrain his invective against these Pontiffs, who heaped favours and\r\nhonours upon him, what but virulence can be expected of him when\r\nhe writes of Alexander VI? He is largely to blame for the flagrant\r\nexaggeration of many of the charges brought against the Borgias; that he\r\nhated them we know, and that when he wrote of them he dipped his golden\r\nTuscan pen in vitriol and set down what he desired the world to believe\r\nrather than what contemporary documents would have revealed to him,\r\nwe can prove here and now from that one statement of his which we have\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\nWho were the men who were filled with dismay, horror, or dread at\r\nRoderigo’s election?\r\n\r\nThe Milanese? No. For we know that Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, the Duke\r\nof Milan’s brother, was the most active worker in favour of Roderigo’s\r\nelection, and that this same election was received and celebrated in\r\nMilan with public rejoicings.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines? No. For the Medici were friendly to the House of\r\nBorgia, and we know that they welcomed the election, and that from\r\nFlorence Manfredi--the Ferrarese ambassador--wrote home: “It is said he\r\nwill be a glorious Pontiff” (“Dicesi che sará glorioso Pontefice”).\r\n\r\nWere Venice, Genoa, Mantua, Siena, or Lucca dismayed by this election?\r\nSurely not, if the superlatively laudatory congratulations of their\r\nvarious ambassadors are of any account.\r\n\r\nVenice confessed that “a better pastor could not have been found for the\r\nChurch,” since he had proved himself “a chief full of experience and an\r\nexcellent cardinal.”\r\n\r\nGenoa said that “his merit lay not in having been elected, but in having\r\nbeen desired.”\r\n\r\nMantua declared that it “had long awaited the pontificate of one who,\r\nduring forty years, had rendered himself, by his wisdom and justice,\r\ncapable of any office.”\r\n\r\nSiena expressed its joy at seeing the summit of eminence attained by\r\na Pope solely upon his merits--“Pervenuto alla dignitá pontificale\r\nmeramente per meriti proprii.”\r\n\r\nLucca praised the excellent choice made, and extolled the\r\naccomplishments, the wisdom, and experience of the Pontiff.\r\n\r\nNot dismay, then, but actual rejoicing must have been almost universal\r\nin Italy on the election of Pope Alexander VI. And very properly--always\r\nconsidering the Pontificate as the temporal State it was then being\r\naccounted; for Roderigo’s influence was vast, his intelligence was\r\nrenowned, and had again and again been proved, and his administrative\r\ntalents and capacity for affairs were known to all. He was well-born,\r\ncultured, of a fine and noble presence, and his wealth was colossal,\r\ncomprising the archbishoprics of Valencia and Porto, the bishoprics of\r\nMajorca, Carthage, Agria, the abbeys of Subiaco, the Monastery of Our\r\nLady of Bellefontaine, the deaconry of Sancta Maria in Via Lata, and his\r\noffices of Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Holy Church.\r\n\r\nWe are told that he gained his election by simony. It is very\r\nprobable that he did. But the accusation has never been categorically\r\nestablished, and until that happens it would be well to moderate\r\nthe vituperation hurled at him. Charges of that simony are common;\r\nconclusive proof there is none. We find Giacomo Trotti, the French\r\nambassador in Milan, writing to the Duke of Ferrara a fortnight after\r\nRoderigo’s election that “the Papacy has been sold by simony and a\r\nthousand rascalities, which is a thing ignominious and detestable.”\r\n\r\nIgnominious and detestable indeed, if true; but be it remembered that\r\nTrotti was the ambassador of France, whose candidate, backed by French\r\ninfluence and French gold, as we have seen, was della Rovere; and, even\r\nif his statement was true, the “ignominious and detestable thing” was at\r\nleast no novelty. Yet Guicciardini, treating of this matter, says: “He\r\ngained the Pontificate owing to discord between the Cardinals Ascanio\r\nSforza and Giuliano di San Pietro in Vincoli; and still more because, in\r\na manner without precedent in that age [con esempio nuovo in quella etá]\r\nhe openly bought the votes of many cardinals, some with money, some with\r\npromises of his offices and benefices, which were very great.”\r\n\r\nAgain Guicciardini betrays his bias by attempting to render Roderigo’s\r\ncourse, assuming it for the moment to be truly represented, peculiarly\r\nodious by this assertion that it was without precedent in that age.\r\n\r\nWithout precedent! What of the accusations of simony against Innocent\r\nVIII, which rest upon a much sounder basis than these against Alexander,\r\nand what of those against Sixtus IV? Further, if a simoniacal election\r\nwas unprecedented, what of Lorenzo Valla’s fierce indictment of\r\nsimony--for which he so narrowly escaped the clutches of the Inquisition\r\nsome sixty years before this date?\r\n\r\nSimony was rampant at the time, and it is the rankest hypocrisy to make\r\nthis outcry against Alexander’s uses of it, and to forget the others.\r\n\r\nWhether he really was elected by simony or not depends largely--so far\r\nas the evidence available goes--upon what we are to consider as\r\nsimony. If payment in the literal sense was made or promised, then\r\nunquestionably simony there was. But this, though often asserted, still\r\nawaits proof. If the conferring of the benefices vacated by a cardinal\r\non his elevation to the Pontificate is to be considered simony, then\r\nthere never was a Pope yet against whom the charge could not be levelled\r\nand established.\r\n\r\nConsider that by his election to the Pontificate his Archbishoprics,\r\noffices, nay, his very house itself--which at the time of which we write\r\nit was customary to abandon to pillage--are vacated; and remember that,\r\nas Pope, they are now in his gift and that they must of necessity be\r\nbestowed upon somebody. In a time in which Pontiffs are imbued with a\r\nspiritual sense of their office and duties, they will naturally make\r\nsuch bestowals upon those whom they consider best fitted to use them\r\nfor the greater honour and glory of God. But we are dealing with no such\r\nspiritual golden age as that when we deal with the Cinquecento, as we\r\nhave already seen; and, therefore, all that we can expect of a Pope is\r\nthat he should bestow the preferment he has vacated upon those among\r\nthe cardinals whom he believes to be devoted to himself. Considering his\r\nelection in a temporal sense, it is natural that he should behave as any\r\nother temporal prince; that he should remember those to whom he owes\r\nthe Pontificate, and that he should reward them suitably. Alexander\r\nVI certainly pursued such a course, and the greatest profit from his\r\nelection was derived by the Cardinal Sforza who--as Roderigo himself\r\nadmitted--had certainly exerted all his influence with the Sacred\r\nCollege to gain him the Pontificate. Alexander gave him the vacated\r\nVice-Chancellorship (for which, when all is said, Ascanio Sforza was\r\nexcellently fitted), his vacated palace on Banchi Vecchi, the town of\r\nNepi, and the bishopric of Agri.\r\n\r\nTo Orsini he gave the Church of Carthage and the legation of Marche; to\r\nColonna the Abbey of Subiaco; to Savelli the legation of Perugia (from\r\nwhich he afterwards recalled him, not finding him suited to so difficult\r\na charge); to Raffaele Riario went Spanish benefices worth four thousand\r\nducats yearly; to Sanseverino Roderigo’s house in Milan, whilst he\r\nconsented that Sanseverino’s nephew--known as Fracassa--should enter\r\nthe service of the Church with a condotta of a hundred men-at-arms and a\r\nstipend of thirteen thousand ducats yearly.\r\n\r\nGuicciardini says of all this that Ascanio Sforza induced many of the\r\ncardinals “to that abominable contract, and not only by request and\r\npersuasion, but by example; because, corrupt and of an insatiable\r\nappetite for riches, he bargained for himself, as the reward of so much\r\nturpitude, the Vice-Chancellorships, churches, fortresses [the very\r\nplurals betray the frenzy of exaggeration dictated by his malice] and\r\nhis [Roderigo’s] palace in Rome full of furniture of great value.”\r\n\r\nWhat possible proof can Guicciardini have--what possible proof can there\r\nbe--of such a “bargain”? It rests upon purest assumption formed after\r\nthose properties had changed hands--Ascanio being rewarded by them for\r\nhis valuable services, and, also--so far as the Vice-Chancellorship was\r\nconcerned--being suitably preferred. To say that Ascanio received\r\nthem in consequence of a “bargain” and as the price of his vote and\r\nelectioneering services is not only an easy thing to say, but it is the\r\nobvious thing for any one to say who aims at defaming.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that we should find in Guicciardini no mention of the\r\nfour mule-loads of silver removed before the election from Cardinal\r\nRoderigo’s palace on Banchi Vecchi to Cardinal Ascanio’s palace in\r\nTrastevere. This is generally alleged to have been part of the price\r\nof Ascanio’s services. Whether it was so, or whether, as has also been\r\nurged, it was merely removed to save it from the pillaging by the mob\r\nof the palace of the cardinal elected to the Pontificate, the fact is\r\ninteresting as indicating in either case Cardinal Roderigo’s assurance\r\nof his election.\r\n\r\nM. Yriarte does not hesitate to say: “We know to-day, by the dispatches\r\nof Valori, the narrative of Girolamo Porzio, and the Diarium of\r\nBurchard, the Master of Ceremonies, each of the stipulations made with\r\nthe electors whose votes were bought.”\r\n\r\nNow whilst we do know from Valori and Porzio what benefices Alexander\r\nactually conferred, we do not know, nor could they possibly have\r\ntold us, what stipulations had been made which these benefices were\r\ninsinuated to satisfy.\r\n\r\nBurchard’s Diarium might be of more authority on this subject, for\r\nBurchard was the Master of Ceremonies at the Vatican; but, unfortunately\r\nfor the accuracy of M. Yriarte’s statement, Burchard is silent on the\r\nsubject, for the excellent reason that there is no diary for the period\r\nunder consideration. Burchard’s narrative is interrupted on the death of\r\nInnocent VIII, on July 12, and not resumed until December 2, when it is\r\nnot retrospective.\r\n\r\nThere is, it is true, the Diarium of Infessura. But that is of no more\r\nauthority on such a matter than the narrative of Porzio or the letters\r\nof Valori.\r\n\r\nLord Acton--in his essay upon this subject--has not been content to rest\r\nthe imputation of simony upon such grounds as satisfied M. Yriarte. He\r\nhas realized that the only testimony of any real value in such a case\r\nwould be the actual evidence of such cardinals as might be willing\r\nto bear witness to the attempt to bribe them. And he takes it for\r\ngranted--as who would not at this time of day, and in view of such\r\npositive statements as abound?--that such evidence has been duly\r\ncollected; thus, he tells us confidently that the charge rests upon the\r\nevidence of those cardinals who refused Roderigo’s bribes.\r\n\r\nThat it most certainly does not. If it did there would be an end to\r\nthe matter, and so much ink would not have been spilled over it; but no\r\nsingle cardinal has left any such evidence as Lord Acton supposes and\r\nalleges. It suffices to consider that, according to the only evidences\r\navailable--the Casanatense Codices(1) and the dispatches of that same\r\nValori(2) whom M. Yriarte so confidently cites, Roderigo Borgia’s\r\nelection was unanimous. Who, then, were these cardinals who refused\r\nhis bribes? Or are we to suppose that, notwithstanding that refusal--a\r\nrefusal which we may justifiably suppose to have been a scandalized and\r\nrighteously indignant one--they still afforded him their votes?\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “...essendo concordi tutti i cardinali, quasi da contrari voti rivolti\r\ntutti in favore di uno solo, crearono lui sommo ponteflce” (Casanatense\r\nMSS). See P. Leonetti, Alessandro VI. 2 “Fu pubblicato il Cardinale\r\nVice-Cancelliere in Sommo Pontefice Alessandro VI(to) nuncupato, el\r\nquale dopo una lunga contentione fu creato omnium consensum--ne ii manco\r\nun solo voto” (Valori’s letter to the Otto di Pratica, August 12,\r\n1492). See Supplement to Appendix in E. Thuasne’s edition of Burchard’s\r\nDiarium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis charge of simony was levelled with the object of making Alexander\r\nVI appear singularly heinous. So much has that object engrossed and\r\nblinded those inspired by it, that, of itself, it betrays them. Had\r\ntheir horror been honest, had it sprung from true principles, had it\r\nbeen born of any but a desire to befoul and bespatter at all costs\r\nRoderigo Borgia, it is not against him that they would have hurled their\r\ndenunciations, but against the whole College of Cardinals which took\r\npart in the sacrilege and which included three future Popes.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Cardinals Piccolomini, de’Medici, and Giuliano della Rovere.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssuming not only that there was simony, but that it was on as wholesale\r\na scale as was alleged, and that for gold--coined or in the form of\r\nbenefices--Roderigo bought the cardinal’s votes, what then? He bought\r\nthem, true. But they--they sold him their sacred trust, their duty\r\nto their God, their priestly honour, their holy vows. For the gold he\r\noffered them they bartered these. So much admitted, then surely, in that\r\ntransaction, those cardinals were the prostitutes! The man who bought\r\nso much of them, at least, was on no baser level than were they.\r\nYet invective singles him out for its one object, and so betrays the\r\naforethought malice of its inspiration.\r\n\r\nOur quarrel is with that; with that, and with those writers who have\r\ntaken Alexander’s simony for granted--eagerly almost--for the purpose\r\nof heaping odium upon him by making him appear a scandalous exception to\r\nthe prevailing rule.\r\n\r\nIf, nevertheless, we hold, as we have said, that simony probably did\r\ntake place, we do so, not so much upon the inconclusive evidence of the\r\nfact, as upon the circumstance that it had become almost an established\r\ncustom to purchase the tiara, and that Roderigo Borgia--since his\r\nambition clearly urged him to the Pontificate--would have been an\r\nexception had he refrained.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that to have disputed so long to conclude by admitting so\r\nmuch is no better than a waste of labour. Not so, we hope. Our aim has\r\nbeen to correct the adjustment of the focus and properly to trim the\r\nlight in which Roderigo Borgia is to be viewed, to the end that you may\r\nsee him as he was--neither better nor worse--the creature of his\r\ntimes, of his environment, and of the system in which he was reared and\r\ntrained. Thus shall you also get a clearer view of his son Cesare, when\r\npresently he takes the stage more prominently.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeen days of the interregnum between the death of\r\nInnocent and the election of Alexander the wild scenes usual to\r\nsuch seasons had been taking place in Rome; and, notwithstanding the\r\nCardinal-Chamberlain’s prompt action in seizing the gates and bridges,\r\nand the patrols’ endeavours to maintain order, crime was unfettered\r\nto such an extent that some 220 murders are computed to have taken\r\nplace--giving the terrible average of thirteen a day.\r\n\r\nIt was a very natural epilogue to the lax rule of the lethargic\r\nInnocent. One of the first acts of Alexander’s reign was to deal\r\nsummarily with this lawlessness. He put down violence with a hard hand\r\nthat knew no mercy. He razed to the ground the house of a murderer\r\ncaught red-handed, and hanged him above the ruins, and so dealt\r\ngenerally that such order came to prevail as had never before been known\r\nin Rome.\r\n\r\nInfessura tells us how, in the very month of his election, he appointed\r\ninspectors of prisons and four commissioners to administer justice,\r\nand that he himself gave audience on Tuesdays and settled disputes,\r\nconcluding, “et justitiam mirabili modo facere coepit.”\r\n\r\nHe paid all salaries promptly--a striking departure, it would seem,\r\nfrom what had been usual under his predecessor--and the effect of his\r\nimproved and strenuous legislation was shortly seen in the diminished\r\nprices of commodities.\r\n\r\nHe was crowned Pope on August 6, on the steps of the Basilica of\r\nSt. Peter, by the Cardinal-Archdeacon Piccolomini. The ceremony was\r\ncelebrated with a splendour worthy of the splendid figure that was its\r\ncentre. Through the eyes of Michele Ferno--despite his admission that\r\nhe is unable to convey a worthy notion of the spectacle--you may see the\r\ngorgeous procession to the Lateran in which Alexander VI showed himself\r\nto the applauding Romans; the multitude of richly adorned men, gay and\r\nfestive; the seven hundred priests and prelates, with their familiars\r\nthe splendid cavalcade of knights and nobles of Rome; the archers and\r\nTurkish horsemen, and the Palatine Guard, with its great halberds and\r\nflashing shields; the twelve white horses, with their golden bridles,\r\nled by footmen; and then Alexander himself on a snow-white horse,\r\n“serene of brow and of majestic dignity,” his hand uplifted--the\r\nFisherman’s Ring upon its forefinger--to bless the kneeling populace.\r\nThe chronicler flings into superlatives when he comes to praise the\r\npersonal beauty of the man, his physical vigour and health, “which go to\r\nincrease the veneration shown him.”\r\n\r\nThus in the brilliant sunshine of that Italian August, amid the plaudits\r\nof assembled Rome, amid banners and flowers, music and incense, the\r\nflash of steel and the blaze of decorations with the Borgian arms\r\neverywhere displayed--or, a grazing steer gules--Alexander VI passes to\r\nthe Vatican, the aim and summit of his vast ambition.\r\n\r\nFriends and enemies alike have sung the splendours of that coronation,\r\nand the Bull device--as you can imagine--plays a considerable part in\r\nthose verses, be they paeans or lampoons. The former allude to Borgia as\r\n“the Bull,” from the majesty and might of the animal that was displayed\r\nupon their shield; the latter render it the subject of much scurrilous\r\ninvective, to which it lends itself as readily. And thereafter, in\r\nalmost all verse of their epoch, writers ever say “the Bull” when they\r\nmean the Borgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. BORGIA ALLIANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of his father’s election to the throne of St. Peter, Cesare\r\nBorgia--now in his eighteenth year--was still at the University of Pisa.\r\n\r\nIt is a little odd, considering the great affection for his children\r\nwhich was ever one of Roderigo’s most conspicuous characteristics,\r\nthat he should not have ordered Cesare to Rome at once, to share in the\r\ngeneral rejoicings. It has been suggested that Alexander wished to avoid\r\ngiving scandal by the presence of his children at such a time. But that\r\nagain looks like a judgement formed upon modern standards, for by the\r\nstandards of his day one cannot conceive that he would have given\r\nvery much scandal; moreover, it is to be remembered that Lucrezia and\r\nGiuffredo, at least, were in Rome at the time of their father’s election\r\nto the tiara.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, Cesare did not quit Pisa until August of that year\r\n1492, and even then not for Rome, but for Spoleto--in accordance with\r\nhis father’s orders--where he took up his residence in the castle.\r\nThence he wrote a letter to Piero de’Medici, which is interesting,\r\nfirstly, as showing the good relations prevailing between them;\r\nsecondly, as refuting a story in Guicciardini, wherewith that historian,\r\nready, as ever, to belittle the Borgias, attempts to show him cutting a\r\npoor figure. He tells us(1) that, whilst at Pisa, Cesare had occasion\r\nto make an appeal to Piero de’Medici in the matter of a criminal case\r\nconnected with one of his familiars; that he went to Florence and waited\r\nseveral hours in vain for an audience, whereafter he returned to Pisa\r\n“accounting himself despised and not a little injured.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Istoria d’Italia, tom. V.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt Guicciardini is as mistaken in this as in many another matter,\r\nfor the letter written from Spoleto expresses his regret that, on\r\nthe occasion of his passage through Florence (on his way from Pisa to\r\nSpoleto), he should not have had time to visit Piero, particularly as\r\nthere was a matter upon which he desired urgently to consult with him.\r\nHe recommends to Piero his faithful Remolino, whose ambition it is to\r\noccupy the chair of canon law at the University of Pisa, and begs his\r\ngood offices in that connection. That Juan Vera, Cesare’s preceptor\r\nand the bearer of that letter, took back a favourable answer is highly\r\nprobable, for in Fabroni’s Hist. Acad. Pisan we find this Remolino duly\r\nestablished as a lecturer on canon law in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe letter is further of interest as showing Cesare’s full consciousness\r\nof the importance of his position; its tone and its signature--“your\r\nbrother, Cesar de Borgia, Elect of Valencia”--being such as were usual\r\nbetween princes.\r\n\r\nThe two chief aims of Alexander VI, from the very beginning of his\r\npontificate, were to re-establish the power of the Church, which was\r\nthen the most despised of the temporal States of Italy, and to promote\r\nthe fortune of his children. Already on the very day of his coronation\r\nhe conferred upon Cesare the bishopric of Valencia, whose revenues\r\namounted to an annual yield of sixteen thousand ducats. For the time\r\nbeing, however, he had his hands very full of other matters, and it\r\nbehoved him to move slowly at first and with the extremest caution.\r\n\r\nThe clouds of war were lowering heavily over Italy when Alexander came\r\nto St. Peter’s throne, and it was his first concern to find for himself\r\na safe position against the coming of the threatening storm. The chief\r\nmenace to the general peace was Lodovico Maria Sforza, surnamed Il\r\nMoro,(1) who sat as regent for his nephew, Duke Gian Galeazzo, upon\r\nthe throne of Milan. That regency he had usurped from Gian Galeazzo’s\r\nmother, and he was now in a fair way to usurp the throne itself. He kept\r\nhis nephew virtually a prisoner in the Castle of Pavia, together with\r\nhis young bride, Isabella of Aragon, who had been sent thither by her\r\nfather, the Duke of Calabria, heir to the crown of Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Touching Lodovico Maria’s by-name of “Il Moro”--which is generally\r\ntranslated as “The Moor,” whilst in one writer we have found him\r\nmentioned as “Black Lodovico,” Benedetto Varchi’s explanation (in his\r\nStoria Fiorentina) may be of interest. He tells us that Lodovico was not\r\nso called on account of any swarthiness of complexion, as is supposed by\r\nGuicciardini, because, on the contrary, he was fair; nor yet on account\r\nof his device, showing a Moorish squire, who, brush in hand, dusts the\r\ngown of a young woman in regal apparel, with the motto, “Per Italia\r\nnettar d’ogni bruttura”; this device of the Moor, he tells us, was a\r\nrébus or pun upon the word “moro,” which also means the mulberry, and\r\nwas so meant by Lodovico. The mulberry burgeons at the end of winter\r\nand blossoms very early. Thus Lodovico symbolized his own prudence and\r\nreadiness to seize opportunity betimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGian Galeazzo thus bestowed, Lodovico Maria went calmly about the\r\nbusiness of governing, like one who did not mean to relinquish the\r\nregency save to become duke. But it happened that a boy was born to the\r\nyoung prisoners at Pavia, whereupon, spurred perhaps into activity by\r\nthis parenthood and stimulated by the thought that they had now a son’s\r\ninterests to fight for as well as their own, they made appeal to King\r\nFerrante of Naples that he should enforce his grandson-in-law’s rights\r\nto the throne of Milan. King Ferrante could desire nothing better, for\r\nif his grandchild and her husband reigned in Milan, and by his favour\r\nand contriving, great should be his influence in the North of Italy.\r\nTherefore he stood their friend.\r\n\r\nMatters were at this stage when Alexander VI ascended the papal throne.\r\n\r\nThis election gave Ferrante pause, for, as we have seen, he had schemed\r\nfor a Pope devoted to his interests, who would stand by him in the\r\ncoming strife, and his schemes were rudely shaken now. Whilst he was\r\nstill cogitating the matter of his next move, the wretched Francesco\r\nCibo (Pope Innocent’s son) offered to sell the papal fiefs of Cervetri\r\nand Anguillara, which had been made over to him by his father, to\r\nGentile Orsini--the head of his powerful house. And Gentile purchased\r\nthem under a contract signed at the palace of Cardinal Giuliano della\r\nRovere, on September 3, for the sum of forty thousand ducats advanced\r\nhim by Ferrante.\r\n\r\nAlexander protested strongly against this illegal transaction, for\r\nCervetri and Anguillara were fiefs of the Church, and neither had Cibo\r\nthe right to sell nor Orsini the right to buy them. Moreover, that they\r\nshould be in the hands of a powerful vassal of Naples such as Orsini\r\nsuited the Pope as little as it suited Lodovico Maria Sforza. It stirred\r\nthe latter into taking measures against the move he feared Ferrante\r\nmight make to enforce Gian Galeazzo’s claims.\r\n\r\nLodovico Maria went about this with that sly shrewdness so\r\ncharacteristic of him, so well symbolized by his mulberry badge--a\r\nhumorous shrewdness almost, which makes him one of the most delightful\r\nrogues in history, just as he was one of the most debonair and cultured.\r\nHe may indeed be considered as one of the types of the subtle, crafty,\r\nselfish politician that was the ideal of Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\nYou see him, then, effacing the tight-lipped, cunning smile from his\r\ncomely face and pointing out to Venice with a grave, sober countenance\r\nhow little it can suit her to have the Neapolitan Spaniards ruffling\r\nit in the north, as must happen if Ferrante has his way with Milan.\r\nThe truth of this was so obvious that Venice made haste to enter into\r\na league with him, and into the camp thus formed came, for their own\r\nsakes, Mantua, Ferrara, and Siena. The league was powerful enough thus\r\nto cause Ferrante to think twice before he took up the cudgels for Gian\r\nGaleazzo. If Lodovico could include the Pope, the league’s might would\r\nbe so paralysing that Ferrante would cease to think at all about his\r\ngrandchildren’s affairs.\r\n\r\nForeseeing this, Ferrante had perforce to dry the tears Guicciardini has\r\nit that he shed, and, replacing them by a smile, servile and obsequious,\r\nrepaired, hat in hand, to protest his friendship for the Pope’s\r\nHoliness.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in December of 1492, came the Prince of Altamura--Ferrante’s\r\nsecond son--to Rome to lay his father’s homage at the feet of the\r\nPontiff, and at the same time to implore his Holiness to refuse the King\r\nof Hungary the dispensation the latter was asking of the Holy See, to\r\nenable him to repudiate his wife, Donna Leonora--Ferrante’s daughter.\r\n\r\nAltamura was received in Rome and sumptuously entertained by the\r\nCardinal Giuliano della Rovere. This cardinal had failed, as we have\r\nseen, to gain the Pontificate for himself, despite the French influence\r\nby which he had been supported. Writhing under his defeat, and hating\r\nthe man who had defeated him with a hatred so bitter and venomous\r\nthat the imprint of it is on almost every act of his life--from the\r\nfacilities he afforded for the assignment to Orsini of the papal fiefs\r\nthat Cibo had to sell--he was already scheming for the overthrow of\r\nAlexander. To this end he needed great and powerful friends; to this end\r\nhad he lent himself to the Cibo-Orsini transaction; to this end did he\r\nmanifest himself the warm well-wisher of Ferrante; to this end did he\r\ncordially welcome the latter’s son and envoy, and promise his support to\r\nFerrante’s petition.\r\n\r\nBut the Holy Father was by no means as anxious for the friendship of\r\nthe old wolf of Naples. The matter of the King of Hungary was one that\r\nrequired consideration, and, meanwhile, he may have hinted slyly there\r\nwas between Naples and Rome a little matter of two fiefs to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nThus his most shrewd Holiness thought to gain a little time, and in that\r\ntime he might look about him and consider what alliances would suit his\r\ninterests best.\r\n\r\nAt this Cardinal della Rovere, in high dudgeon, flung out of Rome and\r\naway to his Castle of Ostia to fortify--to wield the sword of St. Paul,\r\nsince he had missed the keys of St. Peter. It was a shrewd move.\r\nHe foresaw the injured dignity of the Spanish House of Naples, and\r\nFerrante’s wrath at the Pope’s light treatment of him and apathy for\r\nhis interests; and the cardinal knew that with Ferrante were allied the\r\nmighty houses of Colonna and Orsini. Thus, by his political divorcement\r\nfrom the Holy See, he flung in his lot with theirs, hoping for red war\r\nand the deposition of Alexander.\r\n\r\nBut surely he forgot Milan and Lodovico Maria, whose brother, Ascanio\r\nSforza, was at the Pope’s elbow, the energetic friend to whose efforts\r\nAlexander owed the tiara, and who was therefore hated by della Rovere\r\nperhaps as bitterly as Alexander himself.\r\n\r\nAlexander went calmly about the business of fortifying the Vatican and\r\nthe Castle of Sant’ Angelo, and gathering mercenaries into his service.\r\nAnd, lest any attempt should be made upon his life when he went abroad,\r\nhe did so with an imposing escort of men-at-arms; which so vexed and\r\nfretted King Ferrante, that he did not omit to comment upon it in\r\nscathing terms in a letter that presently we shall consider. For the\r\nrest, the Pope’s Holiness preserved an unruffled front in the face of\r\nthe hostile preparations that were toward in the kingdom of Naples,\r\nknowing that he could check them when he chose to lift his finger and\r\nbeckon the Sforza into alliance. And presently Naples heard an alarming\r\nrumour that Lodovico Maria had, in fact, made overtures to the Pope,\r\nand that the Pope had met these advances to the extent of betrothing\r\nhis daughter Lucrezia to Giovanni Sforza, Lord of Pesaro and cousin to\r\nLodovico.\r\n\r\nSo back to the Vatican went the Neapolitan envoys with definite\r\nproposals of an alliance to be cemented by a marriage between Giuffredo\r\nBorgia--aged twelve--and Ferrante’s granddaughter Lucrezia of Aragon.\r\nThe Pope, with his plans but half-matured as yet, temporized, was\r\nevasive, and continued to arm and to recruit. At last, his arrangements\r\ncompleted, he abruptly broke off his negotiations with Naples, and on\r\nApril 25, 1493, publicly proclaimed that he had joined the northern\r\nleague.\r\n\r\nThe fury of Ferrante, who realized that he had been played with and\r\noutwitted, was expressed in a rabid letter to his ambassador at the\r\nCourt of Spain.\r\n\r\n“This Pope,” he wrote, “leads a life that is the abomination of all,\r\nwithout respect for the seat he occupies. He cares for nothing save to\r\naggrandize his children, by fair means or foul, and this is his sole\r\ndesire. From the beginning of his Pontificate he has done nothing but\r\ndisturb the peace, molesting everybody, now in one way, now in another.\r\nRome is more full of soldiers than of priests, and when he goes abroad\r\nit is with troops of men-at-arms about him, with helmets on their heads\r\nand lances by their sides, all his thoughts being given to war and to\r\nour hurt; nor does he overlook anything that can be used against us, not\r\nonly inciting in France the Prince of Salerno and other of our rebels,\r\nbut befriending every bad character in Italy whom he deems our enemy;\r\nand in all things he proceeds with the fraud and dissimulation natural\r\nto him, and to make money he sells even the smallest office and\r\npreferment.”\r\n\r\nThus Ferrante of the man whose friendship he had been seeking some six\r\nweeks earlier, and who had rejected his advances. It is as well to know\r\nthe precise conditions under which that letter was indited, for extracts\r\nfrom it are too often quoted against Alexander. These conditions known,\r\nand known the man who wrote it, the letter’s proper value is at once\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nIt was Ferrante’s hope, and no doubt the hope of Giuliano della Rovere,\r\nthat the King of Spain would lend an ear to these grievances, and move\r\nin the matter of attempting to depose Alexander; but an event more\r\nimportant than any other in the whole history of Spain--or of Europe,\r\nfor that matter--was at the moment claiming its full attention, and the\r\ntrifling affairs of the King of Naples--trifling by comparison--went\r\nall unheeded. For this was the year in which the Genoese navigator,\r\nCristofero Colombo, returned to tell of the new and marvellous world\r\nhe had discovered beyond the seas, and Ferdinand and Isabella were\r\naddressing an appeal to the Pope--as Ruler of the World--to establish\r\nthem in the possession of the discovered continent. Whereupon the Pope\r\ndrew a line from pole to pole, and granted to Spain the dominion over\r\nall lands discovered, or to be discovered, one hundred miles westward of\r\nCape Verde and the Azores.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Ferrante’s appeal to Spain against a Pope who showed himself so\r\nready and complaisant a friend to Spain went unheeded by Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella. And what time the Neapolitan nursed his bitter chagrin, the\r\nalliance between Rome and Milan was consolidated by the marriage of\r\nLucrezia Borgia to Giovanni Sforza, the comely weakling who was Lord of\r\nPesaro and Cotignola.\r\n\r\nLucrezia Borgia’s story has been told elsewhere; her rehabilitation\r\nhas been undertaken by a great historian(1) among others, and all\r\nserious-minded students must be satisfied at this time of day that the\r\nLucrezia Borgia of Hugo’s tragedy is a creature of fiction, bearing\r\nlittle or no resemblance to the poor lady who was a pawn in the\r\nambitious game played by her father and her brother Cesare, before she\r\nwithdrew to Ferrara, where eventually she died in child-birth in her\r\nforty-first year. We know that she left the duke, her husband, stricken\r\nwith a grief that was shared by his subjects, to whom she had so deeply\r\nendeared herself by her exemplary life and loving rule.(2)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Ferdinand Gregorovius, Lucrezia Borgia.\r\n2 See, inter alia, the letters of Alfonso d’Este and Giovanni Gonzaga on\r\nher death, quoted in Gregorovius, Lucrezia Borgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, in the course of this narrative, where she crosses the story\r\nof her brother Cesare, it will be necessary to deal with some of\r\nthe revolting calumnies concerning her that were circulated, and, in\r\npassing, shall be revealed the sources of the malice that inspired them\r\nand the nature of the evidence upon which they rest, to the eternal\r\nshame alike of those pretended writers of fact and those avowed writers\r\nof fiction who, as dead to scruples as to chivalry, have not hesitated\r\nto make her serve their base melodramatic or pornographic ends.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, there is no more than her first marriage to be\r\nrecorded. She was fourteen years of age at the time, and, like all the\r\nBorgias, of a rare personal beauty, with blue eyes and golden hair.\r\nTwice before, already, had she entered into betrothal contracts with\r\ngentlemen of her father’s native Spain; but his ever-soaring ambition\r\nhad caused him successively to cancel both those unfulfilled contracts.\r\nA husband worthy of the daughter of Cardinal Roderigo Borgia was no\r\nlonger worthy of the daughter of Pope Alexander VI, for whom an alliance\r\nmust now be sought among Italy’s princely houses. And so she came to be\r\nbestowed upon the Lord of Pesaro, with a dowry of 30,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nHer nuptials were celebrated in the Vatican on June 12, 1493, in\r\nthe splendid manner worthy of the rank of all concerned and of the\r\nreputation for magnificence which the Borgia had acquired. That night\r\nthe Pope gave a supper-party, at which were present some ten cardinals\r\nand a number of ladies and gentlemen of Rome, besides the ambassadors\r\nof Ferrara, Venice, Milan, and France. There was vocal and instrumental\r\nmusic, a comedy was performed, the ladies danced, and they appear to\r\nhave carried their gaieties well into the dawn. Hardly the sort of scene\r\nfor which the Vatican was the ideal stage. Yet at the time it should\r\nhave given little or no scandal. But what a scandal was there not,\r\nshortly afterwards, in connection with it, and how that scandal was\r\nheaped up later, by stories so revolting of the doings of that night\r\nthat one is appalled at the minds that conceived them and the credulity\r\nthat accepted them.\r\n\r\nInfessura writes of what he heard, and he writes venomously, as he\r\nbetrays by the bitter sarcasm with which he refers to the fifty silver\r\ncups filled with sweetmeats which the Pope tossed into the laps of\r\nladies present at the earlier part of the celebration. “He did it,”\r\n says Infessura, “to the greater honour and glory of Almighty God and the\r\nChurch of Rome.” Beyond that he ventures into no great detail, checking\r\nhimself betimes, however, with a suggested motive for reticence a\r\nthousand times worse than any formal accusation. Thus: “Much else is\r\nsaid, of which I do not write, because either it is not true, or, if\r\ntrue, incredible.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Et multa alia dicta sunt; que hic non scribo, que aut non sunt; vel\r\nsi sunt, incredibilia” (Infessura, Diarium).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is amazing that the veil which Infessura drew with those words should\r\nhave been pierced--not indeed by the cold light of fact, but by the hot\r\neye of prurient imagination; amazing that he should be quoted at all--he\r\nwho was not present--considering that we have the testimony of what did\r\ntake place from the pen of an eye-witness, in a letter from Gianandrea\r\nBoccaccio, the ambassador of Ferrara, to his master.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his letter, which describes the proceedings and the\r\nwedding-gifts and their presentation, he tells us how the night was\r\nspent. “Afterwards the ladies danced, and, as an interlude, a worthy\r\ncomedy was performed, with much music and singing, the Pope and all the\r\nrest of us being present throughout. What else shall I add? It would\r\nmake a long letter. The whole night was spent in this manner; let your\r\nlordship decide whether well or ill.”\r\n\r\nIs not that sufficient to stop the foul mouth of inventive slander? What\r\nneed to suggest happenings unspeakable? Yet it is the fashion to quote\r\nthe last sentence above from Boccaccio’s letter in the original--“totam\r\nnoctem comsumpsimus; judicet modo Ex(ma.) Dominatio vestra si bene\r\no male”--as though decency forbade its translation; and at once this\r\npoisonous reticence does its work, and the imagination--and not only\r\nthat of the unlettered--is fired, and all manner of abominations are\r\nspeculatively conceived.\r\n\r\nInfessura, being absent, says that the comedies performed were\r\nlicentious (“lascive”). But what comedies of that age were not? It was\r\nan age which had not yet invented modesty, as we understand it. That\r\nBoccaccio, who was present, saw nothing unusual in the comedy--there\r\nwas only one, according to him--is proved by his description of it as\r\n“worthy” (“una degna commedia.”)\r\n\r\nM. Yriarte on this same subject(1) is not only petty, but grotesque.\r\nHe chooses to relate the incident from the point of view of Infessura,\r\nwhom, by the way, he translates with an amazing freedom,(2) and he makes\r\nbold to add regarding Gianandrea Boccaccio that: “It must also be\r\nsaid that the ambassador of Ferrara, either because he did not see\r\neverything, or because he was less austere than Infessura, was not\r\nshocked by the comedies, etc.” (“soit qu’il n’ait pas tout vu, soit\r\nqu’il ait été moins austère qu’Infessura, n’est pas choqué....”)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  La Vie de César Borgia.\r\n2 Thus in the matter of the fifty silver cups tossed by the Pope into\r\nthe ladies’ laps, “sinum” is the word employed by Infessura--a word\r\nwhich has too loosely been given its general translation of “bosom,”\r\n ignoring that it equally means “lap” and that “lap” it obviously means\r\nin this instance. M. Yriarte, however, goes a step further, and prefers\r\nto translate it as “corsage,” which at once, and unpleasantly, falsifies\r\nthe picture; and he adds matter to dot the I’s to an extent certainly\r\nnot warranted even by Infessura.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Yriarte, you observe, does not scruple to opine that Boccaccio, who\r\nwas present, did not see everything; but he has no doubt that Infessura,\r\nwho was not present, and who wrote from “hearsay,” missed nothing.\r\n\r\nAlas! Too much of the history of the Borgias has been written in this\r\nspirit, and the discrimination in the selection of authorities has ever\r\nbeen with a view to obtaining the more sensational rather than the more\r\ntruthful narrative.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is known that Cesare came to Rome in the early part of\r\n1493--for his presence there is reported by Gianandrea Boccaccio\r\nin March of that year--there is no mention of him at this time in\r\nconnection with his sister’s wedding. Apparently, then, he was not\r\npresent, although it is impossible to suggest where he might have been\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio draws a picture of him in that letter, which is worthy of\r\nattention, “On the day before yesterday I found Cesare at home in\r\nTrastevere. He was on the point of setting out to go hunting, and\r\nentirely in secular habit; that is to say, dressed in silk and armed.\r\nRiding together, we talked a while. I am among his most intimate\r\nacquaintances. He is man of great talent and of an excellent nature; his\r\nmanners are those of the son of a great prince; above everything, he is\r\njoyous and light-hearted. He is very modest, much superior to, and of a\r\nmuch finer appearance than, his brother the Duke of Gandia, who also is\r\nnot short of natural gifts. The archbishop never had any inclination for\r\nthe priesthood. But his benefice yields him over 16,000 ducats.”\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss--though perhaps no longer very necessary, after what\r\nhas been written--to say a word at this stage on the social position of\r\nbastards in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, to emphasize the fact\r\nthat no stigma attached to Cesare Borgia or to any other member of his\r\nfather’s family on the score of the illegitimacy of their birth.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to consider the marriages they contracted to perceive\r\nthat, however shocking the circumstances may appear to modern notions,\r\nthe circumstance of their father being a Pope not only cannot have been\r\naccounted extraordinarily scandalous (if scandalous at all) but, on the\r\ncontrary, rendered them eligible for alliances even princely.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries we see the bastard born of\r\na noble, as noble as his father, displaying his father’s arms without\r\ndebruisement and enjoying his rank and inheritance unchallenged on the\r\nscore of his birth, even though that inheritance should be a throne--as\r\nwitness Lucrezia’s husband Giovanni, who, though a bastard of the house\r\nof Sforza, succeeded, nevertheless, his father in the Tyranny of Pesaro\r\nand Cotignola.\r\n\r\nLater we shall see this same Lucrezia, her illegitimacy notwithstanding,\r\nmarried into the noble House of Este and seated upon the throne of\r\nFerrara. And before then we shall have seen the bastard Cesare married\r\nto a daughter of the royal House of Navarre. Already we have seen the\r\nbastard Francesco Cibo take to wife the daughter of the great Lorenzo\r\nde’Medici, and we have seen the bastard Girolamo Riario married to\r\nCaterina Sforza--a natural daughter of the ducal House of Milan--and we\r\nhave seen the pair installed in the Tyranny of Imola and Forli. A score\r\nof other instances might be added; but these should suffice.\r\n\r\nThe matter calls for the making of no philosophies, craves no\r\nexplaining, and, above all, needs no apology. It clears itself.\r\nThe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries--more just than our own more\r\nenlightened times--attributed no shame to the men and women born out of\r\nwedlock, saw no reason--as no reason is there, Christian or Pagan--why\r\nthey should suffer for a condition that was none of their contriving.\r\n\r\nTo mention it may be of help in visualizing and understanding that\r\ndirect and forceful epoch, and may even suggest some lenience in\r\nconsidering a Pope’s carnal paternity. To those to whom the point of\r\nview of the Renaissance does not promptly suggest itself from this plain\r\nstatement of fact, all unargued as we leave it, we recommend a perusal\r\nof Gianpietro de Crescenzi’s Il Nobile Romano.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Lucrezia Borgia to Giovanni Sforza tightened the\r\nrelations between the Pope and Milan, as the Pope intended. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, the crafty and mistrustful Lodovico, having no illusions as\r\nto the true values of his allies, and realizing them to be self-seekers\r\nlike himself, with interests that were fundamentally different from his\r\nown, perceived that they were likely only to adhere to him for just\r\nso long as it suited their own ends. He bethought him, therefore, of\r\nlooking about him for other means by which to crush the power of Naples.\r\nFrance was casting longing eyes upon Italy, and it seemed to Lodovico\r\nthat in France was a ready catspaw. Charles VIII, as the representative\r\nof the House of Anjou, had a certain meagre claim upon the throne of\r\nNaples; if he could be induced to ride south, lance on thigh, and press\r\nthat claim there would be an end to the dominion of the House of Aragon,\r\nand so an end to Lodovico’s fears of a Neapolitan interference with his\r\nown occupation of the throne of Milan.\r\n\r\nTo an ordinary schemer that should have been enough; but as a schemer\r\nLodovico was wholly extraordinary. His plans grew in the maturing, and\r\ntook in side-issues, until he saw that Naples should be to Charles VIII\r\nas the cheese within the mouse-trap. Let his advent into Italy to break\r\nthe power of Naples be free and open; but, once within, he should find\r\nMilan and the northern allies between himself and his retreat, and\r\nLodovico’s should it be to bring him to his knees. Thus schemed Lodovico\r\nto shiver, first Naples and then France, before hurling the latter back\r\nacross the Alps. A daring, bold, and yet simple plan of action. And what\r\na power in Italy should not Lodovico derive from its success!\r\n\r\nForthwith he got secretly to work upon it, sending his invitation to\r\nCharles to come and make good his claim to Naples, offering the French\r\ntroops free passage through his territory.(1) And in the character\r\nof his invitation he played upon the nature of malformed, ambitious\r\nCharles, whose brain was stuffed with romance and chivalric\r\nrhodomontades. The conquest of Naples was an easy affair, no more than\r\na step in the glorious enterprise that awaited the French king, for\r\nfrom Naples he could cross to engage the Turk, and win back the Holy\r\nSepulchre, thus becoming a second Charles the Great.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  See Corlo, Storia di Milano, and Lodovico’s letter to Charles VIII,\r\nquoted therein, lib. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus Lodovico Maria the crafty, to dazzle Charles the romantic, and to\r\ntake the bull of impending invasion by the very horns.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the failure of the appeal to Spain against the Pope made\r\nby the King of Naples. To that failure was now added the tightening of\r\nRome’s relations with Milan by the marriage between Lucrezia Borgia and\r\nGiovanni Sforza, and Ferrante--rumours of a French invasion, with\r\nNaples for its objective being already in the air--realized that nothing\r\nremained him but to make another attempt to conciliate the Pope’s\r\nHoliness. And this time he went about his negotiations in a manner\r\nbetter calculated to serve his ends, since his need was grown more\r\nurgent. He sent the Prince of Altamura again to Rome for the ostensible\r\npurpose of settling the vexatious matter of Cervetri and Anguillara and\r\nmaking alliance with the Holy Father, whilst behind Altamura was the\r\nNeapolitan army ready to move upon Rome should the envoy fail this time.\r\n\r\nBut on the terms now put forward, Alexander was willing to negotiate,\r\nand so a peace was patched up between Naples and the Holy See, the\r\nconditions of which were that Orsini should retain the fiefs for his\r\nlifetime, but that they should revert to Holy Church on his death, and\r\nthat he should pay the Church for the life-lease of them the sum of\r\n40,000 ducats, which already he had paid to Francesco Cibo; that the\r\npeace should be consolidated by the marriage of the Pope’s bastard,\r\nGiuffredo, with Sancia of Aragon, the natural daughter of the Duke of\r\nCalabria, heir to the throne of Naples, and that she should bring the\r\nPrincipality of Squillace and the County of Coriate as her dowry.\r\n\r\nThe other condition demanded by Naples--at the suggestion of Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere--was that the Pope should disgrace and dismiss\r\nhis Vice­Chancellor, Ascanio Sforza, which would have shattered the\r\npontifical relations with Milan. To this, however, the Pope would not\r\nagree, but he met Naples in the matter to the extent of consenting to\r\noverlook Cardinal della Rovere’s defection and receive him back into\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nOn these terms the peace was at last concluded in August of 1493, and\r\nimmediately afterwards there arrived in Rome the Sieur Peron de Basche,\r\nan envoy from the King of France charged with the mission to prevent any\r\nalliance between Rome and Naples.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman was behind the fair. The Pope took the only course\r\npossible under the awkward circumstances, and refused to see the\r\nambasssador. Thereupon the offended King of France held a grand council\r\n“in which were proposed and treated many things against the Pope and for\r\nthe reform of the Church.”\r\n\r\nThese royal outbursts of Christianity, these pious kingly frenzies to\r\nunseat an unworthy Pontiff and reform the Church, follow always, you\r\nwill observe, upon the miscarriage of royal wishes.\r\n\r\nIn the Consistory of September 1493 the Pope created twelve new\r\ncardinals to strengthen the Sacred College in general and his own hand\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\nAmongst these new creations were the Pope’s son Cesare, and Alessandro\r\nFarnese, the brother of the beautiful Giulia. The grant of the red hat\r\nto the latter appears to have caused some scandal, for, owing to the\r\nPope’s relations with his sister, to which it was openly said that\r\nFarnese owed the purple, he received the by-name of Cardinal della\r\nGonella--Cardinal of the Petticoat.\r\n\r\nThat was the first important step in the fortunes of the House of\r\nFarnese, which was to give dukes to Parma, and reach the throne of Spain\r\n(in the person of Isabella Farnese) before becoming extinct in 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II. THE BULL PASCANT\r\n\r\nRoma Bovem invenit tunc, cum fundatur aratro, Et nunc lapsa suo est ecce\r\nrenata Bove.\r\n\r\nFrom an inscription quoted by Bernardino Coaxo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE FRENCH INVASION\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see Cesare Borgia, now in his nineteenth year, raised to the purple\r\nwith the title of Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria Nuova--notwithstanding\r\nwhich, however, he continues to be known in preference, and, indeed, to\r\nsign himself by the title of his archbishopric, Cardinal of Valencia.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to mention that, although already Bishop of\r\nPampeluna and Archbishop of Valencia, he had received so far only his\r\nfirst tonsure. He never did receive any ecclesiastical orders beyond the\r\nminor and revocable ones.\r\n\r\nIt was said by Infessura, and has since been repeated by a multitude of\r\nhistorians, upon no better authority than that of this writer on hearsay\r\nand inveterate gossip, that, to raise Cesare to the purple, Alexander\r\nwas forced to prove the legitimacy of that young man’s birth, and that\r\nto this end he procured false witnesses to swear that he was “the son of\r\nVannozza de’ Catanei and her husband, Domenico d’Arignano.” Already has\r\nthis been touched upon in an earlier chapter, here it was shown that\r\nVannozza never had a husband of the name of d’Arignano, and it might\r\nreasonably be supposed that this circumstance alone would have sufficed\r\nto restrain any serious writer from accepting and repeating Infessura’s\r\nunauthoritative statement.\r\n\r\nBut if more they needed, it was ready to their hands in the Bull\r\nof Sixtus IV of October 1, 1480--to which also allusion has been\r\nmade--dispensing Cesare from proving his legitimacy: “Super defectum\r\nnatalium od ordines et quoecumque beneficia.”\r\n\r\nBesides that, of what avail would any false swearing have been,\r\nconsidering that Cesare was openly named Borgia, that he was openly\r\nacknowledged by his father, and that in the very Bull above mentioned he\r\nis stated to be the son of Roderigo Borgia?\r\n\r\nThis is another instance of the lightness, the recklessness with which\r\nAlexander VI has been accused of unseemly and illicit conduct, which it\r\nmay not be amiss to mention at this stage, since, if not the accusation\r\nitself, at least the matter that occasioned it belongs chronologically\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nDuring the first months of his reign--following in the footsteps of\r\npredecessors who had made additions to the Vatican--Alexander set\r\nabout the building of the Borgia Tower. For its decoration he brought\r\nPerugino, Pinturicchio, Volterrano, and Peruzzi to Rome. Concerning\r\nPinturicchio and Alexander, Vasari tells us, in his Vita degli Artefici,\r\nthat over the door of one of the rooms in the Borgia Tower the artist\r\npainted a picture of the Virgin Mary in the likeness of Giulia Farnese\r\n(who posed to him as the model) with Alexander kneeling to her in\r\nadoration, arrayed in full pontificals.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing would have been horrible, revolting, sacrilegious.\r\nFortunately it does not even amount to a truth untruly told; and well\r\nwould it be if all the lies against the Borgias were as easy to refute.\r\nTrue, Pinturicchio did paint Giulia Farnese as the Madonna; true also\r\nthat he did paint Alexander kneeling in adoration--but not to the\r\nMadonna, not in the same picture at all. The Madonna for which Giulia\r\nFarnese was the model is over a doorway, as Vasari says. The kneeling\r\nAlexander is in another room, and the object of his adoration is the\r\nSaviour rising from His tomb.\r\n\r\nYet one reputable writer after another has repeated that lie of\r\nVasari’s, and shocked us by the scandalous spectacle of a Pope so\r\ndebauched and lewd that he kneels in pontificals, in adoration, at the\r\nfeet of his mistress depicted as the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nIn October of that same year of 1493 Cesare accompanied his father on a\r\nvisit to Orvieto, a journey which appears to have been partly undertaken\r\nin response to an invitation from Giulia Farnese’s brother Alessandro.\r\n\r\nOrvieto was falling at the time into decay and ruin, no longer the\r\nprosperous centre it had been less than a hundred years earlier; but the\r\nshrewd eye of Alexander perceived its value as a stronghold, to be used\r\nas an outpost of Rome or as a refuge in time of danger, and he proceeded\r\nto repair and fortify it. In the following summer Cesare was invested\r\nwith its governorship, at the request of its inhabitants, who sent an\r\nembassy to the Pope with their proposal,--by way, no doubt, of showing\r\ntheir gratitude for his interest in the town.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, towards the end of 1493, King Ferrante’s uneasiness\r\nat the ever-swelling rumours of the impending French invasion was\r\nquickened by the fact that the Pope had not yet sent his son Giuffredo\r\nto Naples to marry Donna Sancia, as had been contracted. Ferrante feared\r\nthe intrigues of Milan with Alexander, and that the latter might\r\nbe induced, after all, to join the northern league. In a frenzy of\r\napprehension, the old king was at last on the point of going to Milan to\r\nthrow himself at the feet of Lodovico Sforza, who was now his only hope,\r\nwhen news reached him that his ambassadors had been ordered to leave\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThat death-blow to his hopes was a death-blow to the man himself. Upon\r\nreceiving the news he was smitten by an apoplexy, and upon January 25,\r\n1494, he departed this life without the consolation of being able to\r\nsuppose that any of his schemes had done anything to avert the impending\r\nruin of his house.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all Alexander’s intercessions and representations,\r\ncalculated to induce Charles VIII to abandon his descent upon Italy; in\r\nspite, no less, of the counsel he received at home from such far-seeing\r\nmen as had his ear, the Christian King was now determined upon the\r\nexpedition and his preparations were well advanced. In the month of\r\nMarch he assumed the title of King of Sicily, and sent formal intimation\r\nof it to Alexander, demanding his investiture at the hands of the Pope\r\nand offering to pay him a heavy annual tribute. Alexander was thus given\r\nto choose between the wrath of France and the wrath of Naples, and--to\r\nput the basest construction on his motives--he saw that the peril from\r\nan enemy on his very frontiers would be more imminent than that of an\r\nenemy beyond the Alps. It is also possible that he chose to be guided by\r\nhis sense of justice and to do in the matter what he considered right.\r\nBy whatever motive he was prompted, the result was that he refused to\r\naccede to the wishes of the Christian King.\r\n\r\nThe Consistory which received the French ambassador--Peron de\r\nBasche--became the scene of stormy remonstrances, Cardinal Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere, of course, supporting the ambassador and being supported\r\nin his act of insubordination by the Vice-Chancellor Ascanio Sforza\r\n(who represented his brother Lodovico in the matter) and the Cardinals\r\nSanseverino, Colonna, and Savelli, all attached to French interests.\r\nPeron de Basche so far presumed, no doubt emboldened by this support, as\r\nto threaten the Pope with deposition if he persisted in his refusal to\r\nobey the King of France.\r\n\r\nYou see once more that kingly attitude, and you shall see it yet again\r\npresently and be convinced of its precise worth. In one hand a bribe of\r\nheavy annual tribute, in the other a threat of deposition; it was thus\r\nthey conducted their business with the Holy Father. In this instance his\r\nHoliness took the threat, and dismissed the insolent ambassador. Della\r\nRovere, conceiving that in France he had a stouter ally than in Naples,\r\nand seeing that he had once more incurred the papal anger by his\r\nopen enmity, fled back to Ostia; and, not feeling safe there, for the\r\npontifical forces were advancing upon his fortress, took ship to Genoa,\r\nand thence to France, to plot the Pope’s ruin with the exasperated\r\nCharles; and, the charge of simony being the only weapon with which\r\nthey could attack Alexander’s seat upon the papal throne, the charge of\r\nsimony was once more brandished.\r\n\r\nHis Holiness took the matter with a becoming and stately calm. He sent\r\nhis nephew, Giovanni Borgia, to Naples to crown Alfonso, and with him\r\nwent Giuffredo Borgia to carry out the marriage contract with Alfonso’s\r\ndaughter, and thus strengthen the alliance between Rome and Naples.\r\n\r\nBy the autumn Charles had crossed the Alps with the most formidable army\r\nthat had ever been sent out of France, full ninety thousand strong. And\r\nso badly was the war conducted by the Neapolitan generals who were sent\r\nto hold him in check that the appearance of the French under the very\r\nwalls of Rome was almost such as to take the Pope by surprise. Charles’s\r\nadvance from the north had been so swift and unhindered that Alexander\r\ncontemptuously said the French soldiers had come into Italy with wooden\r\nspurs and chalk in their hands to mark their lodgings.\r\n\r\nCharles had been well received by the intriguing Lodovico Sforza, with\r\nwhom he visited the Castle of Pavia and the unfortunate Gian Galeazzo,\r\nwho from long confinement, chagrin, and other causes was now reduced\r\nto the sorriest condition. Indeed, on October 22, some days after that\r\nvisit, the wretched prince expired. Whether or not Lodovico had him\r\npoisoned, as has been alleged--a charge, which, after all, rests on no\r\nproof, nor even upon the word of any person of reliance--his death most\r\ncertainly lies at his ambitious uncle’s door.\r\n\r\nCharles was at Piacenza when the news of Gian Galeazzo’s death reached\r\nhim. Like the good Christian that he accounted himself, he ordered the\r\nmost solemn and imposing obsequies for the poor youth for whom in life\r\nhe had done nothing.\r\n\r\nGian Galeazzo left a heart-broken girl-widow and two children to succeed\r\nhim to the throne he had never been allowed to occupy--the eldest,\r\nFrancesco Sforza, being a boy of five. Nevertheless, Lodovico was\r\nelected Duke of Milan. Not only did he suborn the Parliament of Milan\r\nto that end, but he induced the Emperor to confirm him in the title. To\r\nthis the Emperor consented, seeking to mask the unscrupulous deed by a\r\npitiful sophism. He expounded that the throne of Milan should originally\r\nhave been Lodovico’s, and never Galeazzo Maria’s (Gian Galeazzo’s\r\nfather), because the latter was born before Francesco Sforza had become\r\nDuke of Milan, whereas Lodovico was born when he already was so.\r\n\r\nThe obsequies of Gian Galeazzo completed, Charles pushed on. From\r\nFlorence he issued his manifesto, and although this confined itself to\r\nclaiming the kingdom of Naples, and said no word of punishing the Pope\r\nfor his disobedience in crowning Alfonso and being now in alliance with\r\nhim, it stirred up grave uneasiness at the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThe Pope’s position was becoming extremely difficult; nevertheless,\r\nhe wore the boldest possible face when he received the ambassadors of\r\nFrance, and on December 9 refused to grant the letters patent of passage\r\nthrough the Pontifical States which the French demanded. Thereupon\r\nCharles advanced threateningly upon Rome, and was joined now by those\r\nturbulent barons Orsini, Colonna, and Savelli.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI has been widely accused of effecting a volte-face at this\r\nstage and betraying his Neapolitan allies; but his conduct, properly\r\nconsidered, can hardly amount to that. What concessions he made to\r\nFrance were such as a wise and inadequately supported man must make to\r\nan army ninety thousand strong. To be recklessly and quixotically heroic\r\nis not within the function of Popes; moreover, Alexander had Rome to\r\nthink of, for Charles had sent word that, if he were resisted he would\r\nleave all in ruins, whereas if a free passage were accorded him he would\r\ndo no hurt nor suffer any pillage to be done in Rome.\r\n\r\nSo the Pope did the only thing consistent with prudence: he made a\r\nvirtue of necessity and gave way where it was utterly impossible for him\r\nto resist. He permitted Charles the passage through his territory which\r\nCharles was perfectly able to take for himself if refused. There ensued\r\nan interchange of compliments between Pope and King, and early in\r\nJanuary Charles entered Rome in such warlike panoply as struck terror\r\ninto the hearts of all beholders. Of that entrance Paolo Giovio has left\r\nus an impressive picture.\r\n\r\nThe vanguard was composed of Swiss and German mercenaries--tall fellows,\r\nthese professional warriors, superb in their carriage and stepping\r\nin time to the beat of their drums; they were dressed in variegated,\r\nclose-fitting garments that revealed all their athletic symmetry. A\r\nfourth of them were armed with long, square-bladed halberts, new to\r\nItaly; the remainder trailed their ten-foot pikes, and carried a short\r\nsword at their belts, whilst to every thousand of them there were a\r\nhundred arquebusiers. After them came the French infantry, without\r\narmour save the officers, who wore steel corselets and head-pieces.\r\nThese, again, were followed by five thousand Gascon arbalisters, each\r\nshouldering his arbalest--a phalanx of short, rude fellows, not to be\r\ncompared with the stately Swiss. Next came the cavalry, advancing in\r\nsquadrons, glittering and resplendent in their steel casings; 2,500 of\r\nthese were in full heavy armour, wielding iron maces and the ponderous\r\nlances that were usual also in Italy. Every man-at-arms had with him\r\nthree horses, mounted by a squire and two valets (four men going to the\r\nlance in France). Some 5,000 of the cavalry were more lightly armed, in\r\ncorselets and head-piece only, and they carried long wooden bows in the\r\nEnglish fashion; whilst some were armed with pikes, intended to complete\r\nthe work of the heavier cavalry. These were followed by 200 knights--the\r\nvery flower of French chivalry for birth and valour--shouldering their\r\nheavy iron maces, their armour covered by purple, gold-embroidered\r\nsurcoats. Behind them came 400 mounted archers forming the bodyguard of\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nThe misshapen monarch himself was the very caricature of a man, hideous\r\nand grotesque as a gargoyle. He was short of stature, spindle-shanked,\r\nrachitic and malformed, and of his face, with its colossal nose, loose\r\nmouth and shallow brow, Giovio says that “it was the ugliest ever seen\r\non man.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the person of the young king--he was twenty-four years of age\r\nat the time--who poured his legions into Rome, and all full-armed as if\r\nfor work of immediate destruction. Seen, as they were, by torchlight\r\nand the blaze of kindled bonfires--for night had fallen long before\r\nthe rearguard had entered the city--they looked vague, fantastic, and\r\nterrifying. But the most awe-inspiring sight of all was kept for the\r\nend; it consisted of the thirty-six pieces of artillery which brought\r\nup the rear, each piece upon a carriage swiftly drawn by horses, and\r\nthe longest measuring eight feet, weighing six thousand pounds, and\r\ndischarging an iron ball as big as a man’s head.\r\n\r\nThe king lay in the Palace of San Marco, where a lodging had been\r\nprepared for him, and thither on the day after his entrance came Cesare\r\nBorgia, with six Cardinals, from the Castle of Sant’ Angelo, whither\r\nthe Pope had withdrawn, to wait upon his Christian Majesty. Charles\r\nimmediately revealed the full and exigent nature of his demands. He\r\nrequired the Pope’s aid and counsel in the conquest of Naples, upon\r\nwhich he was proceeding; that Cesare Borgia be delivered into his hands\r\nas a hostage to ensure the Pope’s friendliness; and that the Castle of\r\nSant’ Angelo be handed over to him to be used as a retreat in case of\r\nneed or danger. Further, he demanded that Prince Djem--the brother of\r\nSultan Bajazet, who was in the Pope’s hands--should be delivered up to\r\nhim as a further hostage.\r\n\r\nThis Djem (Gem, or Zizim, as his name is variously spelled) was the\r\nsecond son of Mahomet II, whose throne he had disputed with his brother\r\nBajazet on their father’s death. He had raised an army to enforce his\r\nclaim, and had not lacked for partisans; but he was defeated and put\r\nto flight by his brother. For safety he had delivered himself up to the\r\nKnights of Rhodes, whom he knew to be Bajazet’s implacable enemies.\r\nThey made him very welcome, for d’Aubusson, the Grand Master of Rhodes,\r\nrealized that the possession of the prince’s person was a very fortunate\r\ncircumstance for Christianity, since by means of such a hostage the\r\nTurk could be kept in submission. Accordingly d’Aubusson had sent him to\r\nFrance, and wrote: “While Djem lives, and is in our hands, Bajazet will\r\nnever dare to make war upon Christians, who will thus enjoy great peace.\r\nThus is it salutary that Djem should remain in our power.” And in France\r\nDjem had been well received and treated with every consideration due to\r\na person of his princely rank.\r\n\r\nBut he appears to have become a subject of contention among the\r\nPowers, several of which urged that he could be of greater service to\r\nChristianity in their hands than in those of France. Thus, the King of\r\nHungary had demanded him because, being a neighbour of Bajazet’s, he\r\nwas constantly in apprehension of Turkish raids. Ferdinand of Spain had\r\ndesired him because the possession of him would assist the Catholic King\r\nin the expulsion of the Moors. Ferrante of Naples had craved him because\r\nhe lived in perpetual terror of a Turkish invasion.\r\n\r\nIn the end he had been sent to Rome, whither he went willingly under\r\nthe advice of the Knights of Rhodes, whose prisoner he really considered\r\nhimself. They had discovered that Bajazet was offering enormous bribes\r\nto Charles for the surrender of him, and they feared lest Charles should\r\nsuccumb to the temptation.\r\n\r\nSo Prince Djem had come to Rome in the reign of Pope Innocent VIII, and\r\nthere he had since remained, Sultan Bajazet making the Pope an annual\r\nallowance of forty thousand ducats for his brother’s safe custody. He\r\nwas a willing prisoner, or rather a willing exile, for, far from being\r\nkept a prisoner, he was treated at Rome with every consideration,\r\nassociating freely with those about the Pontifical Court, and being\r\nfrequently seen abroad in company with the Pope and the Duke of Gandia.\r\n\r\nNow Charles was aware that the Pope, in his dread of a French invasion,\r\nand seeing vain all his efforts to dissuade Charles from making his\r\ndescent upon Italy, had appealed for aid to Bajazet. For so doing he has\r\nbeen severely censured, and with some justice, for the picture of the\r\nHead of Christianity making appeal to the infidel to assist him against\r\nChristians is not an edifying one. Still, it receives some measure\r\nof justification when we reflect what was the attitude of these same\r\nChristians towards their Head.\r\n\r\nBajazet himself, thrown into a panic at the thought of Djem falling into\r\nthe hands of a king who proposed to make a raid upon him, answered the\r\nPope begging his Holiness to “have Djem removed from the tribulations of\r\nthis world, and his soul transported to another, where he might enjoy a\r\ngreater peace.” For this service he offered the Pope 300,000 ducats, to\r\nbe paid on delivery of the prince’s body; and, if the price was high, so\r\nwas the service required, for it would have ensured Bajazet a peace of\r\nmind he could not hope to enjoy while his brother lived.\r\n\r\nThis letter was intercepted by Giovanni della Rovere, the Prefect of\r\nSinigaglia, who very promptly handed it to his brother, the Cardinal\r\nGiuliano. The cardinal, in his turn, laid it before the King of France,\r\nwho now demanded of the Pope the surrender of the person of this Djem as\r\na further hostage.\r\n\r\nAlexander began by rejecting the king’s proposals severally and\r\ncollectively, but Charles pressed him to reconsider his refusal, and so,\r\nbeing again between the sword and the wall, the Pope was compelled to\r\nsubmit. A treaty was drawn up and signed on January 15, the king, on\r\nhis side, promising to recognize the Pope and to uphold him in all his\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Charles made solemn act of veneration to the\r\nPontiff in Consistory, kissing his ring and his foot, and professing\r\nobedience to him as the kings of France, his forbears, had ever done.\r\nWords for deeds!\r\n\r\nCharles remained twelve days longer in Rome, and set out at last, on\r\nJanuary 28, upon the conquest of Naples. First he went solemnly to take\r\nhis leave of the Pope, and they parted with every outward mark of a\r\nmutual esteem which they most certainly cannot have experienced. When\r\nCharles knelt for the Pope’s blessing, Alexander raised him up and\r\nembraced him; whilst Cesare completed the show of friendliness by\r\npresenting Charles with six beautiful chargers.\r\n\r\nThey set out immediately afterwards, the French king taking with him\r\nhis hostages, neither of which he was destined to retain for long, with\r\nCesare riding in the place of honour on his right.\r\n\r\nThe army lay at Marino that night, and on the following at Velletri. In\r\nthe latter city Charles was met by an ambassador of Spain--Antonio da\r\nFonseca. Ferdinand and Isabella were moved at last to befriend their\r\ncousins of Naples, whom all else had now abandoned, and at the same time\r\nserve their own interests. Their ambassador demanded that Charles should\r\nabandon his enterprise and return to France, or else be prepared for war\r\nwith Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently probable that Cesare had knowledge of this ultimatum to\r\nCharles, and that his knowledge influenced his conduct. However that may\r\nbe, he slipped out of Velletri in the dead of that same night disguised\r\nas a groom. Half a mile out of the town, Francesco del Sacco, an officer\r\nof the Podestá of Velletri, awaited him with a horse, and on this he\r\nsped back to Rome, where he arrived on the night of the 30th. He went\r\nstraight to the house of one Antonio Flores, an auditor of the Tribunal\r\nof the Ruota and a person of his confidence, who through his influence\r\nand protection was destined to rise to the eminence of the archbishopric\r\nof Avignon and Papal Nuncio to the Court of France.\r\n\r\nCesare remained at Flores’s house, sending word to the Pope of his\r\npresence, but not attempting to approach the Vatican. On the following\r\nday he withdrew to the stronghold of Spoleto.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Rome was thrown into a panic by the young cardinal’s\r\naction and the dread of reprisals on the part of France. The quaking\r\nmunicipality sent representatives to Charles to assure him that Rome had\r\nhad nothing to do with this breach of the treaty, and to implore him not\r\nto visit it upon the city. The king replied by a special embassy to\r\nthe Pope, and there apparently dropped the matter, for a few days later\r\nCesare reappeared at the Vatican.\r\n\r\nCharles, meanwhile, despite the threats of Spain, pushed on to\r\naccomplish his easy conquest.\r\n\r\nKing Alfonso had already fled the kingdom (January 25), abdicating in\r\nfavour of his brother Federigo. His avowed object was to withdraw to\r\nSicily, retire from the world, and do penance for his sins, for which no\r\ndoubt there was ample occasion. The real spur was probably--as opined\r\nby Commines--cowardice; for, says that Frenchman, “Jamais homme cruel ne\r\nfut hardi.”\r\n\r\nFederigo’s defence of the realm consigned to him was not conspicuous,\r\nfor the French entered Naples almost without striking a blow within\r\ntwenty days of their departure from Rome.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Charles laid aside his armour when death robbed him of the\r\nsecond hostage he had brought from the Vatican. On February 25, after\r\na week’s illness, Prince Djem died of dysentery at the Castle of Capua,\r\nwhither Charles had sent him.\r\n\r\nRumours that he had been poisoned by the Pope arose almost at once; but,\r\nconsidering that twenty­eight days had elapsed since his parting\r\nfrom Alexander, it was, with the best intentions in the world, rather\r\ndifficult to make that poisoning credible, until the bright notion was\r\nconceived, and made public, that the poison used was a “white powder”\r\n of unknown components, which did its work slowly, and killed the victim\r\nsome time after it had been administered. Thus, by a bold and brazen\r\ninvention, an impossible falsehood was made to wear a possible aspect.\r\n\r\nAnd in that you have most probably the origin of the famous secret\r\npoison of the Borgias. Having been invented to fit the alleged poisoning\r\nof Prince Djem, which it was desired to fasten upon the Pope by hook or\r\nby crook, it was found altogether too valuable an invention not to be\r\nused again. By means of it, it became possible to lay almost any death\r\nin the world at the door of Alexander.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to inquire further into this particular case, let us\r\nhere and now say that, just as to-day there is no inorganic toxin known\r\nto science that will either lie fallow for weeks in the human system,\r\nsuddenly to become active and slay, or yet to kill by slow degrees\r\ninvolving some weeks in the process, so none was known in the Borgian or\r\nany other era. Science indeed will tell you that the very notion of\r\nany such poison is flagrantly absurd, and that such a toxic action is\r\nagainst all the laws of nature.\r\n\r\nBut a scientific disquisition is unnecessary. For our present needs\r\narguments of common sense should abundantly suffice. This poison--this\r\nwhite powder--was said to be a secret of the Borgias. If that is so,\r\nby what Borgia was the secret of its existence ever divulged? Or, if it\r\nnever was divulged, how comes it to be known that a poison so secret,\r\nand working at such distances of time, was ever wielded by them?\r\n\r\nThe very nature of its alleged action was such as utterly to conceal the\r\nhand that had administered it; yet here, on the first recorded occasion\r\nof its alleged use, it was more or less common knowledge if Giovio and\r\nGuicciardini are to be believed!\r\n\r\nSagredo(1) says that Djem died at Terracina three days after having been\r\nconsigned to Charles VIII, of poison administered by Alexander, to whom\r\nBajazet had promised a large sum of money for the deed. The same is\r\npractically Giovio’s statement, save that Giovio causes him to die at\r\na later date and at Gaeta; Guicciardini and Corio tell a similar story,\r\nbut inform us that he died in Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  In Mem. Storiche dei Monarchi Ottomani.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is entirely upon the authority of these four writers that the Pope is\r\ncharged with having poisoned Djem, and it is noteworthy that in the four\r\nnarratives we find different dates and three different places given as\r\nthe date and place of the Turk’s death, and more noteworthy still that\r\nin not one instance of these four is date or place correctly stated.\r\n\r\nNow the place where Djem died, and the date of his death, were public\r\nfacts about which there was no mystery; they were to be ascertained--as\r\nthey are still--by any painstaking examiner. His poisoning, on the\r\nother hand, was admittedly a secret matter, the truth of which it was\r\nimpossible to ascertain with utter and complete finality. Yet of this\r\npoisoning they know all the secrets, these four nimble writers who\r\ncannot correctly tell us where or when the man died!\r\n\r\nWe will turn from the fictions they have left us--which, alas! have but\r\ntoo often been preferred by subsequent writers to the true facts\r\nwhich lay just as ready to their hands, but of course were less\r\nsensational--and we will consider instead the evidence of those\r\ncontemporaries who do, at least, know the time and place of Djem’s\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\nIf any living man might have known of a secret poison of the Borgias at\r\nthis stage, that man was Burchard the Caeremoniarius, and, had he known\r\nof it, not for a moment would he have been silent on the point. Yet\r\nnot a word of this secret poison shall you find in his diaries, and\r\nconcerning the death of Djem he records that “on February 25 died at the\r\nCastle of Capua the said Djem, through meat or drink that disagreed with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nPanvinio, who, being a Neapolitan, was not likely to be any too friendly\r\nto the Pope--as, indeed, he proves again and again--tells us positively\r\nthat Djem died of dysentry at Capua.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Vitis Pontif. Rom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSanuto, writing to the Council of Ten, says that Djem took ill at Capua\r\nof a catarrh, which “descended to his stomach”; and that so he died.\r\n\r\nAnd now mark Sanuto’s reasoning upon his death, which is the very\r\nreasoning we should ourselves employ finally to dispose of this chatter\r\nof poisoning, did we not find it awaiting quotation, more authoritative\r\ntherefore than it could be from us, and utterly irrefutable and\r\nconclusive in its logic. “This death is very harmful to the King of\r\nFrance, to all Italy, and chiefly to the Pope, who is thereby deprived\r\nof 40,000 ducats yearly, which was paid him by his [Djem’s] brother for\r\nhis custody. And the king showed himself greatly grieved by this death,\r\nand it was suspected that the Pope had poisoned him, which, however, was\r\nnot to be believed, as it would have been to his own loss.”\r\n\r\nJust so--to his own infinite loss, not only of the 40,000 ducats yearly,\r\nbut of the hold which the custody of Djem gave him upon the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe reason assigned by those who charged Alexander with this crime\r\nwas the bribe of 300,000 ducats offered by Bajezet in the intercepted\r\nletter. The offer--which, incidentally, had never reached the Pope--was\r\ninstantly taken as proof of its acceptance--a singular case of making\r\ncause follow upon effect, a method all too prevalent with the Borgian\r\nchroniclers. Moreover, they entirely overlooked the circumstance that,\r\nfor Djem’s death in the hands of France, the Pope could make no claim\r\nupon Bajazet.\r\n\r\nFinally--though the danger be incurred of becoming tedious upon this\r\npoint--they also forgot that, years before, Bajazet had offered such\r\nbribes to Charles for the life of Djem as had caused the Knights of\r\nRhodes to remove the Turk from French keeping. Upon that circumstance\r\nthey might, had it sorted with their inclinations, have set up a\r\nstronger case of poisoning against Charles than against the Pope, and\r\nthey would not have been put to the necessity of inventing a toxin that\r\nnever had place in any earthly pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nIt is not, by this, suggested that there is any shadow of a case against\r\nCharles. Djem died a perfectly natural death, as is established by the\r\nonly authorities competent to speak upon the matter, and his death was\r\nagainst the interests of everybody save his brother Bajazet; and against\r\nnobody’s so much as the Pope’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE POPE AND THE SUPERNATURAL\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of March of that year 1495 the conquest of Naples was a\r\nthoroughly accomplished fact, and the French rested upon their victory,\r\ntook their ease, and made merry in the capital of the vanquished\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nBut in the north Lodovico Sforza-now Duke of Milan de facto, as we have\r\nseen--set about the second part of the game that was to be played. He\r\nhad a valuable ally in Venice, which looked none too favourably on the\r\nFrench and was fully disposed to gather its forces against the common\r\nfoe. The Council of Ten sent their ambassador, Zorzi, to the Pope to\r\npropose an alliance.\r\n\r\nNews reached Charles in Naples of the league that was being formed. He\r\nlaughed at it, and the matter was made the subject of ridicule in some\r\nof the comedies that were being performed for the amusement of his\r\nCourt. Meanwhile, the intrigue against him went forward; on March 26 his\r\nHoliness sent the Golden Rose to the Doge, and on Palm Sunday the league\r\nwas solemnly proclaimed in St. Peter’s. Its terms were vague; there\r\nwas nothing in it that was directly menacing to Charles; it was simply\r\ndeclared to have been formed for the common good. But in the north the\r\nforces were steadily gathering to cut off the retreat of the French, and\r\nsuddenly Lodovico Sforza threw aside the mask and made an attack upon\r\nthe French navy at Genoa.\r\n\r\nAt last Charles awoke to his danger and began to care for his safety.\r\nRapidly he organized the occupation of Naples, and, leaving Montpensier\r\nas Viceroy and d’Aubigny as Captain-General, he set out for Rome with\r\nhis army, intent upon detaching the Pope from the league; for the Pope,\r\nbeing the immediate neighbour of Naples, would be as dangerous as an\r\nenemy as he was valuable as an ally to Charles.\r\n\r\nHe entered Rome on June 1. The Pope, however, was not there to receive\r\nhim. Alexander had left on May 28 for Orvieto, accompanied by Cesare,\r\nthe Sacred College, 200 men-at-arms, and 1,000 horse and 3,000 foot,\r\nsupplied by Venice. At Orvieto, on June 3, the Pontiff received an\r\nambassador from the Emperor, who had joined the league, and on the\r\n4th he refused audience to the ambassador of France, sent to him from\r\nRonciglione, where the King had halted. Charles, insistent, sent again,\r\ndetermined to see the Pope; but Alexander, quite as determined not to\r\nsee the king, pushed on to Perugia with his escort.\r\n\r\nThere his Holiness abode until the French and Italians had met on the\r\nRiver Taro and joined battle at Fornovo, of which encounter both sides\r\nclaimed the victory. If Charles’s only object was to win through, then\r\nthe victory undoubtedly was his, for he certainly succeeded in cutting\r\na way through the Italians who disputed his passage. But he suffered\r\nheavily, and left behind him most of his precious artillery, his tents\r\nand carriages, and the immense Neapolitan booty he was taking home, with\r\nwhich he had loaded (says Gregorovius) twenty thousand mules. All this\r\nfell into the hands of the Italian allies under Gonzaga of Mantua,\r\nwhilst from Fornovo Charles’s retreat was more in the nature of\r\na flight. Thus he won back to France, no whit the better for his\r\nexpedition, and the only mark of his passage which he left behind him\r\nwas an obscene ailment, which, with the coming of the French into Italy,\r\nfirst manifested itself in Europe, and which the Italians paid them the\r\nquestionable compliment of calling “the French disease”--morbo gallico,\r\nor il mal francese.\r\n\r\nDuring the Pope’s visit to Perugia an incident occurred which is not\r\nwithout importance to students of his character, and of the character\r\nleft of him by his contemporaries and others.\r\n\r\nThere lived in Perugia at this time a young nun of the Order of St.\r\nDominic, who walked in the way of St. Catherine of Siena, Colomba da\r\nRieti by name. You will find some marvellous things about her in the\r\nPerugian chronicles of Matarazzo, which, for that matter, abound in\r\nmarvellous things--too marvellous mostly to be true.\r\n\r\nWhen he deals with events happening beyond the walls of his native town\r\nMatarazzo, as an historian, is contemptible to a degree second only to\r\nthat of those who quote him as an authority. When he deals with matters\r\nthat, so to speak, befell under his very eyes, he is worthy, if not of\r\ncredit at least of attention, for his “atmosphere” is valuable.\r\n\r\nOf this Sister Colomba Matarazzo tells us that she ate not nor drank,\r\nsave sometimes some jujube fruit, and even these but rarely. “On the day\r\nof her coming to Perugia (which happened in 1488), as she was Crossing\r\nthe Bridge of St. Gianni some young men attempted to lay hands upon her,\r\nfor she was comely and beautiful; but as they did so, she showed them\r\nthe jujube fruit which she carried in a white cloth, whereupon they\r\ninstantly stood bereft of strength and wits.”\r\n\r\nNext he tells us how she would pass from life for an hour or two, and\r\nsometimes for half a day, and her pulse would cease to beat, and she\r\nwould, seem all dead. And then she would quiver and come to herself\r\nagain, and prophesy the future, and threaten disaster. And again:\r\n“One morning two of her teeth were found to have fallen out, which had\r\nhappened in fighting with the devil; and, for the many intercessions\r\nwhich she made, and the scandals which she repaired by her prayers, the\r\npeople came to call her saint.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, and the fact that she lived without\r\nnourishment, he tells us that the brothers of St. Francis had little\r\nfaith in her. Nevertheless, the community built her a very fine\r\nmonastery, which was richly endowed, and many nuns took the habit of her\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that whilst at Perugia in his student days, Cesare had\r\nwitnessed a miracle performed by this poor ecstatic girl; or rather he\r\nhad arrived on the scene--the Church of St. Catherine of Siena--to\r\nfind her, with a little naked boy in her lap, the centre of an excited,\r\nfrenzied crowd, which was proclaiming loudly that the child had been\r\ndead and that she had resurrected him. This was a statement which the\r\nPrior of the Dominicans did not seem disposed unreservedly to accept,\r\nfor, when approached with a suggestion that the bells should be rung\r\nin honour of the event, he would not admit that he saw any cause to\r\nsanction such a course.\r\n\r\nIn the few years that were sped since then, however, sister Colomba\r\nhad acquired the great reputation of which Matarazzo tells us, so that,\r\nthroughout the plain of Tiber, the Dominicans were preaching her fame\r\nfrom convent to convent. In December of 1495 Charles VIII heard of\r\nher at Siena, and was stirred by a curiosity which he accounted\r\ndevotional--the same curiosity that caused one of his gentlemen to\r\nentreat Savonarola to perform “just a little miracle” for the King’s\r\nentertainment. You can picture the gloomy fanatic’s reception of that\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nThe Pope now took the opportunity of his sojourn in Perugia to pay\r\nColomba da Rieti a visit, and there can be no doubt that he did so in a\r\ncritical spirit. Accompanied by Cesare and some cardinals and gentlemen\r\nof his following, he went to the Church of St. Dominic and was conducted\r\nto the sister’s cell by the Prior--the same who in Cesare’s student-days\r\nhad refused to have the bells rung.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing the magnificent figure of the Pontiff filling the doorway of\r\nher little chamber, Sister Colomba fell at his feet, and, taking hold of\r\nthe hem of his gown, she remained prostrate and silent for some moments,\r\nwhen at last she timidly arose. Alexander set her some questions\r\nconcerning the Divine Mysteries. These she answered readily at first,\r\nbut, as his questions grew, she faltered, became embarrassed, and fell\r\nsilent, standing before him white and trembling, no doubt a very piteous\r\nfigure. The Pope, not liking this, turned to the Prior to demand an\r\nexplanation, and admonished him sternly: “Caveto, Pater, quia ego Papa\r\nsum!”\r\n\r\nThis had the effect of throwing the Prior into confusion, and he set\r\nhimself to explain that she was in reality very wonderful, that he\r\nhimself had not at first believed in her, but that he had seen so\r\nmuch that he had been converted. At this stage Cesare came to his\r\naid, bearing witness, as he could, that he himself had seen the\r\nPrior discredit her when others were already hailing her as a saint,\r\nwherefore, if he now was convinced, he must have had very good evidence\r\nto convince him. We can imagine the Prior’s gratitude to the young\r\ncardinal for that timely word when he saw himself in danger perhaps of\r\nbeing called to account for fostering and abetting an imposture.\r\n\r\nWhat was Alexander’s opinion of her in the end we do not know; but we\r\ndo know that he was not readily credulous. When, for instance, he heard\r\nthat the stigmata were alleged to have appeared upon the body of Lucia\r\ndi Narni he did what might be expected of a sceptic of our own times\r\nrather than of a churchman of his superstitious age--he sent his\r\nphysicians to examine her.\r\n\r\nThat is but one instance of his common-sense attitude towards\r\nsupernatural manifestations. His cold, calm judgement caused him to\r\nseek, by all available and practical means, to discriminate between the\r\ntrue and the spurious in an age in which men, by their credulity, were\r\nbut too ready to become the prey of any impostor. It argues a breadth of\r\nmind altogether beyond the times in which he had his being. Witches and\r\nwarlocks, who elsewhere--and even in much later ages, and in Protestant\r\nas well as Catholic States--were given to the fire, he contemptuously\r\nignored. The unfortunate Moors and Jews, who elsewhere in Europe were\r\nbeing persecuted by the Holy Inquisition and burnt at the stake as an\r\nact of faith for the good of their souls and the greater honour and\r\nglory of God, found in Alexander a tolerant protector and in Rome a safe\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances concerning him are not sufficiently known; it is\r\ngood to know them for their own sake. But, apart from that, they have\r\na great historical value which it is well to consider. It is not to be\r\nimagined that such breadth of views could be tolerated in a Pope in the\r\ndawn of the sixteenth century. The times were not ripe for it; men\r\ndid not understand it; and what men do not understand they thirst to\r\nexplain, and have a way of explaining in their own fashion and according\r\nto their own lights.\r\n\r\nA Pope who did such things could not be a good Pope, since such things\r\nmust be abhorrent to God--as men conceived God then.\r\n\r\nTo understand this is to understand much of the bad feeling against\r\nAlexander and his family, for this is the source of much of it. Because\r\nhe did not burn witches and magicians it was presently said that he\r\nwas himself a warlock, and that he practised black magic. It was not,\r\nperhaps, wanton calumny; it was said in good faith, for it was the only\r\nreason the times could think of that should account for his restraint.\r\nBecause he tolerated Moors and Jews it was presently said by some that\r\nhe was a Moor, by others that he was a Jew, and by others still that he\r\nwas both.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder, then, if the rancorous Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere\r\nvenomously dubbed him Moor and Jew, and the rabid fanatic Savonarola\r\nscreamed that he was no Pope at all, that he was not a Christian, nor\r\ndid he believe in any God?\r\n\r\nMisunderstood in these matters, he was believed to be an infidel, and no\r\ncrime was too impossible to be fastened upon the man who was believed to\r\nbe that in the Italy of the Cinquecento.\r\n\r\nAlexander, however, was very far from being an infidel, very far from\r\nnot being a Christian, very far from not believing in God, as he has\r\nleft abundant evidence in the Bulls he issued during his pontificate.\r\nIt is certainly wrong to assume--and this is pointed out by\r\nl’Espinois--that a private life which seems to ignore the commandments\r\nof the Church must preclude the possibility of a public life devoted to\r\nthe service of the Church. This is far from being the case. Such a state\r\nof things--such a dual personality--is by no means inconsistent with\r\nchurchmen of the fifteenth, or, for that matter, of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe whole truth of the matter is contained in a Portuguese rhyme, which\r\nmay roughly be translated:\r\n\r\n     Soundly Father Thomas preaches.\r\n     Don’t do as he does; do as he teaches.\r\n\r\nA debauchee may preach virtue with salutary effect, just as a man may\r\npreach hygiene without practising the privations which it entails, or\r\nmay save you from dyspepsia by pointing out to you what is indigestible\r\nwithout himself abstaining from it.\r\n\r\nSuch was the case of Alexander VI, as we are justified in concluding\r\nfrom the evidence that remains.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the apostolic zeal revealed by his Bull granting America\r\nto Spain. This was practically conceded--as the very terms of it will\r\nshow--on condition that Spain should employ the dominion accorded her\r\nover the New World for the purpose of propagating the Christian\r\nfaith and the conversion and baptism of the heathen. This is strictly\r\nenjoined, and emphasized by the command that Spain shall send out\r\nGod-fearing men who are learned in religion and capable of teaching it\r\nto the people of the newly discovered lands.\r\n\r\nThus Alexander invented the missionary.\r\n\r\nTo King Manuel the Fortunate (of Portugal), who sought his authority for\r\nthe conquest of Africa, he similarly enjoined that he should contrive\r\nthat the name of the Saviour be adored there, and the Catholic faith\r\nspread and honoured, to the end that the king “might win eternal life\r\nand the blessing of the Holy See.”\r\n\r\nTo the soldiers going upon this expedition his Holiness granted the same\r\nindulgences as to those who fought in the Holy Land, and he aided the\r\nkings of Spain and Portugal in this propagation of Christianity out of\r\nthe coffers of the Church.\r\n\r\nHe sent to America a dozen of the children of St. Francis, as apostles\r\nto preach the Faith, and he invested them with the amplest powers.\r\n\r\nHe prosecuted with stern rigour the heretics of Bohemia, who were\r\nobscenely insulting Church and Sacraments, and he proceeded similarly\r\nagainst the “Picards” and “Vaudois.” Against the Lombard demoniacs, who\r\nhad grown bold, were banding themselves together and doing great evil to\r\nproperty, to life, and to religion, Alexander raised his mighty arm.\r\n\r\nThen there is his Bull of June 1, 1501, against those who already were\r\nturning to evil purposes the newly discovered printing-press. In this\r\nhe inveighed against the printing of matter prejudicial to healthy\r\ndoctrine, to good manners, and, above all, to the Catholic Faith or\r\nanything that should give scandal to the faithful. He threatened the\r\nprinters of impious works with excommunication should they persist,\r\nand enlisted secular weapons to punish them in a temporal as well as\r\na spiritual manner. He ordered the preparation of indexes of all\r\nworks containing anything hurtful to religion, and pronounced a ban of\r\nexcommunication against all who should peruse the books so indexed.\r\n\r\nThus Alexander invented the Index Expurgatorius.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that he was a fervid celebrant, and of his\r\nextreme devotion to the Blessed Virgin--in whose honour he revived the\r\nringing of the Angelus Bell--shall be considered later.\r\n\r\nWhatever his private life, it is idle to seek to show that his public\r\ncareer was other than devoted to the upholding of the dignity and honour\r\nof the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE ROMAN BARONS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the\r\nallies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore\r\nthe rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished\r\nsoldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain.\r\n\r\nHe landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh\r\nthrough that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined\r\nby the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the\r\nMarquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo.\r\n\r\nLodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms\r\nwith France for his own safety’s sake. But his cousin, Giovanni Sforza,\r\nTyrant of Pesaro--the husband of Lucrezia Borgia--continued in the\r\npontifical army at the head of a condotta of 600 lances. Another command\r\nin the same ranks was one of 700 lances under the youthful Giuffredo\r\nBorgia, now Prince of Squillace and the husband of Doña Sancia of\r\nAragon, a lady of exceedingly loose morals, who had brought to Rome the\r\nhabits acquired in the most licentious Court of that licentious age.\r\n\r\nThe French lost Naples even more easily than they had conquered it, and\r\nby July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend\r\nhis throne. D’Aubigny, the French general, withdrew to France, whilst\r\nMontpensier, the Viceroy, retired to Pozzuoli, where he died in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nNothing could better have suited the purposes of Alexander than the\r\nstate of things which now prevailed, affording him, as it did, the means\r\nto break the power of the insolent Roman barons, who already had so\r\nvexed and troubled him. So in the Consistory of June 1 he published\r\na Bull whereby Gentile Virginio Orsini, Giangiordano Orsini, and his\r\nbastard Paolo Orsini and Bartolomeo d’Alviano, were declared outlawed\r\nfor having borne arms with France against the Church, and their\r\npossessions were confiscated to the State. This decree was to be\r\nenforced by the sword, and, for the purposes of the impending war, the\r\nDuke of Gandia was recalled to Rome. He arrived early in August, having\r\nleft at Gandia his wife Maria Enriquez, a niece of the Royal House of\r\nSpain. It was Cesare Borgia who took the initiative in the pomp with\r\nwhich his brother was received in Rome, riding out at the head of the\r\nentire Pontifical Court to meet and welcome the young duke.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being Duke of Gandia, Giovanni Borgia was already Duke\r\nof Sessa and Prince of Teano, which further dignities had been conferred\r\nupon him on the occasion of his brother Giuffredo’s marriage to Donna\r\nSancia. To these the Pope now added the governorship of Viterbo and of\r\nthe Patrimony of St. Peter, dispossessing Cardinal Farnese of the latter\r\noffice to bestow it upon this well-beloved son.\r\n\r\nIn Venice it was being related, a few months later,--in October--that\r\nGandia had brought a woman from Spain for his father, and that the\r\nlatter had taken her to live with him. The story is given in Sanuto,\r\nand of course has been unearthed and served up by most historians and\r\nessayists. It cannot positively be said that it is untrue; but it can\r\nbe said that it is unconfirmed. There is, for instance, no word of it\r\nin Burchard’s Diarium, and when you consider how ready a chronicler\r\nof scandalous matter was this Master of Ceremonies, you will no doubt\r\nconclude that, if any foundation there had been for that Venetian story,\r\nBurchard would never have been silent on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Pope had taken into his pay that distinguished condottiero, Duke\r\nGuidobaldo of Urbino, who later was to feel the relentless might\r\nof Cesare. To Guidobaldo’s command was now entrusted the punitive\r\nexpedition against the Orsini, and with him was to go the Duke of\r\nGandia, ostensibly to share the leadership, in reality that, under so\r\nable a master, he might serve his apprenticeship to the trade of arms.\r\nSo on October 25 Giovanni Borgia was very solemnly created Gonfalonier\r\nof the Church and Captain-General of the pontifical troops. On the same\r\nday the three standards were blessed in St. Peter’s--one being the Papal\r\nGonfalon bearing the arms of the Church and the other two the personal\r\nbanners of Guidobaldo and Gandia. The two condottieri attended the\r\nceremony, arrayed in full armour, and received the white truncheons that\r\nwere the emblems of their command.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the army set out, accompanied by the Cardinal de\r\nLuna as papal legate a latere, and within a month ten Orsini strongholds\r\nhad surrendered.\r\n\r\nSo far all had been easy for the papal forces; but now the Orsini\r\nrallied in the last three fortresses that remained them--Bracciano,\r\nTrevignano, and Anguillara, and their resistance suddenly acquired a\r\nstubborn character, particularly that of Bracciano, which was captained\r\nby Bartolomeo d’Alviano, a clever, resourceful young soldier who was\r\ndestined to go far. Thus the campaign, so easily conducted at the\r\noutset, received a check which caused it to drag on into the winter. And\r\nnow the barons received further reinforcements. Vitellozzo Vitelli, the\r\nTyrant of Città di Castello, came to the aid of the Orsini, as did also\r\nthe turbulent Baglioni of Perugia, the della Rovere in Rome, and all\r\nthose who were inimical to Alexander VI. On the other hand, however, the\r\nbarons Colonna and Savelli ranged themselves on the side of the Pope.\r\n\r\nAlready Trevignano had fallen, and the attack of the pontifical army\r\nwas concentrated upon Bracciano. Hard pressed, and with all supplies\r\ncut off, Bartolomeo d’Alviano was driven to the very verge of surrender,\r\nwhen over the hills came Carlo Orsini, with the men of Vitellozzo\r\nVitelli, to take the papal forces by surprise and put them to utter\r\nrout. Guidobaldo was made prisoner, whilst the Duke of Gandia, Fabrizio\r\nColonna, and the papal legate narrowly escaped, and took shelter in\r\nRonciglione, the Pope’s son being slightly wounded in the face.\r\n\r\nIt was a severe and sudden conclusion to a war that had begun under\r\nsuch excellent auspices for the Pontificals. Yet, notwithstanding that\r\ndefeat, which had left guns and baggage in the hands of the enemy, the\r\nPope was the gainer by the campaign, having won eleven strongholds from\r\nthe Orsini in exchange for one battle lost.\r\n\r\nThe barons now prepared to push home their advantage and complete\r\nthe victory; but the Pope checkmated them by an appeal to Gonzalo de\r\nCordoba, who promptly responded and came with Prospero Colonna to the\r\naid of the Church. He laid siege to Ostia, which was being held for the\r\nCardinal della Rovere, and compelled it to a speedy surrender, thereby\r\nbringing the Orsini resistance practically to an end. For the present\r\nthe might of the barons was broken, and they were forced to pay\r\nAlexander the sum of 50,000 ducats to redeem their captured fortresses.\r\n\r\nGonzalo de Cordoba made a triumphal entry into Rome, bringing with him\r\nMonaldo da Guerra, the unfortunate defender of Ostia, in chains. He was\r\nreceived with great honour by the Duke of Gandia, accompanied by his\r\nbrother-in-law, Giovanni Sforza, and they escorted him to the Vatican,\r\nwhere the Pope awaited him.\r\n\r\nThis was but one of the many occasions just then on which Giovanni\r\nSforza was conspicuous in public in close association with his\r\nfather-in-law, the Pope. Burchard mentions his presence at the blessing\r\nof the candles on the Feast of the Purification, and shows him to us as\r\na candle-bearer standing on the Pope’s right hand. Again we see him\r\non Palm Sunday in attendance upon Alexander, he and Gandia standing\r\ntogether on the steps of the pontifical throne in the Sixtine Chapel\r\nduring the Blessing of the Palms. There and elsewhere Lucrezia’s husband\r\nis prominently in the public eye during those months of February and\r\nMarch of 1497, and we generally see him sharing, with the Duke of\r\nGandia, the honour of close attendance upon the Pontiff, all of which\r\nbut serves to render the more marked his sudden disappearance from that\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe matter of his abrupt and precipitate flight from Rome is one\r\nconcerning which it is unlikely that the true and complete facts will\r\never be revealed. It was public gossip at this time that his marriage\r\nwith Lucrezia was not a happy one, and that discord marred their life\r\ntogether. Lucrezia’s reported grievance upon this subject reads a\r\nlittle vaguely to us now, whatever it may have conveyed at the time. She\r\ncomplained that Giovanni “did not fittingly keep her company,”(1) which\r\nmay be taken to mean that a good harmony did not prevail between them,\r\nor, almost equally well, that there were the canonical grounds for\r\ncomplaint against him as a husband which were afterwards formally\r\npreferred and made the grounds for the divorce. It is also possible that\r\nAlexander’s ambition may have urged him to dissolve the marriage to\r\nthe end that she might be free to be used again as a pawn in his\r\nfar-reaching game.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Che non gli faceva buona compagnia.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that we do know positively is that, one evening in Holy Week, Sforza\r\nmounted a Turkish horse, and, on the pretext of going as far as the\r\nChurch of Sant’ Onofrio to take the air, he slipped out of Rome, and so\r\ndesperately did he ride that, twenty-four hours later, he was home in\r\nPesaro, his horse dropping dead as he reached the town.\r\n\r\nCertainly some terrible panic must have urged him, and this rather lends\r\ncolour to the story told by Almerici in the Memorie di Pesaro. According\r\nto this, the Lord of Pesaro’s chamberlain, Giacomino, was in Lucrezia’s\r\napartments one evening when Cesare was announced, whereupon, by\r\nLucrezia’s orders, Giacomino concealed himself behind a screen. The\r\nCardinal of Valencia entered and talked freely with his sister, the\r\nessence of his conversation being that the order had been issued for her\r\nhusband’s death.\r\n\r\nThe inference to be drawn from this is that Giovanni had been given to\r\nchoose in the matter of a divorce, and that he had refused to be a party\r\nto it, whence it was resolved to remove him in a still more effective\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the chroniclers of Pesaro proceed to relate that,\r\nafter Cesare had left her, Lucrezia asked Giacomino if he had heard what\r\nhad been said, and, upon being answered in the affirmative, urged him\r\nto go at once and warn Giovanni. It was as a consequence of this alleged\r\nwarning that Giovanni made his precipitate departure.\r\n\r\nA little while later, at the beginning of June, Lucrezia left the\r\nVatican and withdrew to the Convent of San Sisto, in the Appian Way, a\r\nstep which immediately gave rise to speculation and to unbridled gossip,\r\nall of which, however, is too vague to be worthy of the least attention.\r\nAretino’s advices to the Cardinal Ippolito d’Este suggest that she did\r\nnot leave the Vatican on good terms with her family, and it is very\r\npossible, if what the Pesaro chroniclers state is true, that her\r\nwithdrawal arose out of her having warned Giovanni of his danger and\r\nenabled him to escape.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time that Lucrezia withdrew to her convent her brother\r\nGandia was the recipient of further honours at the hands of his fond\r\nfather. The Pope had raised the fief of Benevento to a dukedom, and as\r\na dukedom conferred it upon his son, to him and to his legitimate heirs\r\nfor ever. To this he added the valuable lordships of Terracina and\r\nPontecorvo.\r\n\r\nCesare, meanwhile, had by no means been forgotten, and already this\r\nyoung cardinal was--with perhaps the sole exception of the Cardinal\r\nd’Estouteville--the richest churchman in Christendom. To his many other\r\noffices and benefices it was being proposed to add that of Chamberlain\r\nof the Holy See, Cardinal Riario, who held the office, being grievously\r\nill and his recovery despaired of. Together with that office it was the\r\nPope’s avowed intention to bestow upon Cesare the palace of the late\r\nCardinal of Mantua, and with it, no doubt, he would receive a proportion\r\nof the dead cardinal’s benefices.\r\n\r\nCesare was twenty-two years of age at the time; tall, of an athletic\r\nslenderness, and exceedingly graceful in his movements, he was\r\nacknowledged to be the handsomest man of his age. His face was long and\r\npale, his brow lofty, his nose delicately aquiline. He had long\r\nauburn hair, and his hazel eyes, large, quick in their movements, and\r\nsingularly searching in their glance, were alive with the genius of the\r\nsoul behind them. He inherited from his father the stupendous health\r\nand vigour for which Alexander had been remarkable in his youth, and\r\nwas remarkable still in his old age. The chase had ever been Cesare’s\r\nfavourite pastime, and the wild boar his predilect quarry; and in\r\nthe pursuit of it he had made good use of his exceptional physical\r\nendowments, cultivating them until--like his father before him--he was\r\nequal to the endurance of almost any degree of fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn the Consistory of June 8 he was appointed legate a latere to go to\r\nNaples to crown King Federigo of Aragon--for in the meanwhile another\r\nchange had taken place on the Neapolitan throne by the death of young\r\nFerdinand II, who had been succeeded by his uncle, Federigo, Prince of\r\nAltamura.\r\n\r\nCesare made ready for his departure upon this important mission, upon\r\nwhich he was to be accompanied by his brother Giovanni, Duke of Gandia.\r\nThey were both to be back in Rome by September, when Gandia was to\r\nreturn to Spain, taking with him his sister Lucrezia.\r\n\r\nThus had the Pope disposed; but the Borgia family stood on the eve of\r\nthe darkest tragedy associated with its name, a tragedy which was to\r\nalter all these plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE MURDER OF THE DUKE OF GANDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1497, the eve of Cesare and Giovanni Borgia’s departure\r\nfor Naples, their mother Vannozza gave them a farewell supper in her\r\nbeautiful vineyard in Trastevere. In addition to the two guests of\r\nhonour several other kinsmen and friends were present, among whom were\r\nthe Cardinal of Monreale and young Giuffredo Borgia. They remained at\r\nsupper until an advanced hour of the night, when Cesare and Giovanni\r\ntook their departure, attended only by a few servants and a mysterious\r\nman in a mask, who had come to Giovanni whilst he was at table, and who\r\nalmost every day for about a month had been in the habit of visiting him\r\nat the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThe brothers and these attendants rode together into Rome and as far as\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor Ascanio Sforza’s palace in the Ponte Quarter. Here\r\nGiovanni drew rein, and informed Cesare that he would not be returning\r\nto the Vatican just yet, as he was first “going elsewhere to amuse\r\nhimself.” With that he took his leave of Cesare, and, with one single\r\nexception--in addition to the man in the mask--dismissed his servants.\r\nThe latter continued their homeward way with the cardinal, whilst the\r\nDuke, taking the man in the mask upon the crupper of his horse and\r\nfollowed his single attendant, turned and made off in the direction of\r\nthe Jewish quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it was found that Giovanni had not yet returned, and\r\nhis uneasy servants informed the Pope of his absence and of the\r\ncircumstances of it. The Pope, however, was not at all alarmed.\r\nExplaining his son’s absence in the manner so obviously suggested by\r\nGiovanni’s parting words to Cesare on the previous night, he assumed\r\nthat the gay young Duke was on a visit to some complacent lady and that\r\npresently he would return.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, however, news was brought that his horse had been\r\nfound loose in the streets, in the neighbourhood of the Cardinal of\r\nParma’s palace, with only one stirrup-leather, the other having clearly\r\nbeen cut from the saddle, and, at the same time, it was related that the\r\nservant who had accompanied him after he had separated from the rest\r\nhad been found at dawn in the Piazza della Giudecca mortally wounded and\r\nbeyond speech, expiring soon after his removal to a neighbouring house.\r\n\r\nAlarm spread through the Vatican, and the anxious Pope ordered inquiries\r\nto be made in every quarter where it was possible that anything might\r\nbe learned. It was in answer to these inquiries that a boatman of the\r\nSchiavoni--one Giorgio by name--came forward with the story of what he\r\nhad seen on the night of Wednesday. He had passed the night on board his\r\nboat, on guard over the timber with which she was laden. She was moored\r\nalong the bank that runs from the Bridge of Sant’ Angelo to the Church\r\nof Santa Maria Nuova.\r\n\r\nHe related that at about the fifth hour of the night, just before\r\ndaybreak, he had seen two men emerge from the narrow street alongside\r\nthe Hospital of San Girolamo, and stand on the river’s brink at the spot\r\nwhere it was usual for the scavengers to discharge their refuse carts\r\ninto the water. These men had looked carefully about, as if to make\r\nsure that they were not being observed. Seeing no one astir, they made a\r\nsign, whereupon a man well mounted on a handsome white horse, his heels\r\narmed with golden spurs, rode out of that same narrow street. Behind\r\nhim, on the crupper of his horse, Giorgio beheld the body of a man, the\r\nhead hanging in one direction and the legs in the other. This body was\r\nsupported there by two other men on foot, who walked on either side of\r\nthe horseman.\r\n\r\nArrived at the water’s edge, they turned the horse’s hind-quarters to\r\nthe river; then, taking the body between them, two of them swung it well\r\nout into the stream. After the splash, Giorgio had heard the horseman\r\ninquire whether they had thrown well into the middle, and had heard\r\nhim receive the affirmative answer--“Signor, Si.” The horseman then sat\r\nscanning the surface a while, and presently pointed out a dark object\r\nfloating, which proved to be their victim’s cloak. The men threw stones\r\nat it, and so sank it, whereupon they turned, and all five departed as\r\nthey had come.\r\n\r\nSuch is the boatman’s story, as related in the Diarium of Burchard. When\r\nthe Pope had heard it, he asked the fellow why he had not immediately\r\ngone to give notice of what he had witnessed, to which this Giorgio\r\nreplied that, in his time, he had seen over a hundred bodies thrown into\r\nthe Tiber without ever anybody troubling to know anything about them.\r\n\r\nThis story and Gandia’s continued absence threw the Pope into a frenzy\r\nof apprehension. He ordered the bed of the river to be searched foot by\r\nfoot. Some hundreds of boatmen and fishermen got to work, and on that\r\nsame afternoon the body of the ill-fated Duke of Gandia was brought up\r\nin one of the nets. He was not only completely dressed--as was to\r\nhave been expected from Giorgio’s story--but his gloves and his purse\r\ncontaining thirty ducats were still at his belt, as was his dagger, the\r\nonly weapon he had carried; the jewels upon his person, too, were all\r\nintact, which made it abundantly clear that his assassination was not\r\nthe work of thieves.\r\n\r\nHis hands were still tied, and there were from ten to fourteen wounds on\r\nhis body, in addition to which his throat had been cut.\r\n\r\nThe corpse was taken in a boat to the Castle of Sant’ Angelo, where it\r\nwas stripped, washed, and arrayed in the garments of the Captain-General\r\nof the Church. That same night, on a bier, the body covered with a\r\nmantle of brocade, the face “looking more beautiful than in life,” he\r\nwas carried by torchlight from Sant’ Angelo to Santa Maria del Popolo\r\nfor burial, quietly and with little pomp.\r\n\r\nThe Pope’s distress was terrible. As the procession was crossing the\r\nBridge of Sant’ Angelo, those who stood there heard his awful cries of\r\nanguish, as is related in the dispatches of an eye-witness quoted by\r\nSanuto. Alexander shut himself up in his apartments with his passionate\r\nsorrow, refusing to see anybody; and it was only by insistence that the\r\nCardinal of Segovia and some of the Pope’s familiars contrived to gain\r\nadmission to his presence; but even then, not for three days could they\r\ninduce him to taste food, nor did he sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last he roused himself, partly in response to the instances of the\r\nCardinal of Segovia, partly spurred by the desire to avenge the death of\r\nhis child, and he ordered Rome to be ransacked for the assassins;\r\nbut, although the search was pursued for two months, it proved utterly\r\nfruitless.\r\n\r\nThat is the oft-told story of the death of the Duke of Gandia. Those are\r\nall the facts concerning it that are known or that ever will be known.\r\nThe rest is speculation, and this speculation follows the trend of\r\nmalice rather than of evidence.\r\n\r\nSuspicion fell at first upon Giovanni Sforza, who was supposed to have\r\navenged himself thus upon the Pope for the treatment he had received.\r\nThere certainly existed that reasonable motive to actuate him, but not a\r\nparticle of evidence against him.\r\n\r\nNext rumour had it that Cardinal Ascanio Sforza’s was the hand that had\r\ndone this work, and with this rumour Rome was busy for months. It was\r\nknown that he had quarrelled violently with Gandia, who had been grossly\r\ninsulted by a chamberlain of Ascanio’s, and who had wiped out the insult\r\nby having the man seized and hanged.\r\n\r\nSanuto quotes a letter from Rome on July 21, which states that “it is\r\ncertain that Ascanio murdered the Duke of Gandia.” Cardinal Ascanio’s\r\nnumerous enemies took care to keep the accusation alive at the\r\nVatican, and Ascanio, in fear for his life, had left Rome and fled to\r\nGrottaferrata. When summoned to Rome, he had refused to come save under\r\nsafe­conduct. His fears, however, appear to have been groundless, for\r\nthe Pope attached no importance to the accusation against him, convinced\r\nof his innocence, as he informed him.\r\n\r\nThereupon public opinion looked about for some other likely person\r\nupon whom to fasten its indictment, and lighted upon Giuffredo Borgia,\r\nGandia’s youngest brother. Here, again, a motive was not wanting.\r\nAlready has mention been made of the wanton ways of Giuffredo’s\r\nNeapolitan wife, Doña Sancia. That she was prodigal of her favours there\r\nis no lack of evidence, and it appears that, amongst those she admitted\r\nto them, was the dead duke. Jealousy, then, it was alleged, was the spur\r\nthat had driven Giuffredo to the deed; and that the rumour of this must\r\nhave been insistent is clear when we find the Pope publicly exonerating\r\nhis youngest son.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood, and thus had public opinion spoken, when in the\r\nmonth of August the Pope ordered the search for the murderer to cease.\r\nBracci, the Florentine ambassador, explains this action of Alexander’s.\r\nHe writes that his Holiness knew who were the murderers, and that he was\r\ntaking no further steps in the matter in the hope that thus, conceiving\r\nthemselves to be secure, they might more completely discover themselves.\r\n\r\nBracci’s next letter bears out the supposition that he writes from\r\ninference, and not from knowledge. He repeats that the investigations\r\nhave been suspended, and that to account for this some say what already\r\nhe has written, whilst others deny it; but that the truth of the matter\r\nis known to none.\r\n\r\nLater in the year we find the popular voice denouncing Bartolomeo\r\nd’Alviano and the Orsini. Already in August the Ferrarese ambassador,\r\nManfredi, had written that the death of the Duke of Gandia was being\r\nimputed to Bartolomeo d’Alviano, and in December we see in Sanuto a\r\nletter from Rome which announces that it is positively stated that the\r\nOrsini had caused the death of Giovanni Borgia.\r\n\r\nThese various rumours were hardly worth mentioning for their own values,\r\nbut they are important as showing how public opinion fastened the crime\r\nin turn upon everybody it could think of as at all likely to have had\r\ncause to commit it, and more important still for the purpose of refuting\r\nwhat has since been written concerning the immediate connection of\r\nCesare Borgia with the crime in the popular mind.\r\n\r\nNot until February of the following year was the name of Cesare ever\r\nmentioned in connection with the deed. The first rumour of his\r\nguilt synchronized with that of his approaching renunciation of his\r\necclesiastical career, and there can be little doubt that the former\r\nsprang from the latter. The world conceived that it had discovered on\r\nCesare’s part a motive for the murder of his brother. That motive--of\r\nwhich so very much has been made--shall presently be examined.\r\nMeanwhile, to deal with the actual rumour, and its crystallization into\r\nhistory. The Ferrarese ambassador heard it in Venice on February 12,\r\n1498. Capello seized upon it, and repeated it two and a half years\r\nlater, stating on September 28, 1500: “etiam amazó il fratello.”\r\n\r\nAnd there you have the whole source of all the unbridled accusations\r\nsubsequently launched against Cesare, all of which find a prominent\r\nplace in Gregorovius’s Geschichte der Stadt Rom, whilst the rumours\r\naccusing others, which we have mentioned here, are there slurred over.\r\n\r\nOne hesitates to attack the arguments and conclusions of the very\r\neminent author of that mighty History of Rome in the Middle Ages, but\r\nconscience and justice demand that his chapter upon this subject be\r\ndealt with as it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe striking talents of Gregorovius are occasionally marred by the\r\negotism and pedantry sometimes characteristic of the scholars of his\r\nnation. He is too positive; he seldom opines; he asserts with finality\r\nthe things that only God can know; occasionally his knowledge,\r\ntranscending the possible, quits the realm of the historian for that\r\nof the romancer, as for instance--to cite one amid a thousand--when he\r\nactually tells us what passes in Cesare Borgia’s mind at the coronation\r\nof the King of Naples. In the matter of authorities, he follows a\r\ndangerous and insidious eclecticism, preferring those who support the\r\npoint of view which he has chosen, without a proper regard for their\r\nintrinsic values.\r\n\r\nHe tells us definitely that, if Alexander had not positive knowledge, he\r\nhad at least moral conviction that it was Cesare who had killed the\r\nDuke of Gandia. In that, again, you see the God-like knowledge which\r\nhe usurps; you see him clairvoyant rather than historical. Starting out\r\nwith the positive assertion that Cesare Borgia was the murderer, he sets\r\nhimself to prove it by piling up a mass of worthless evidence, whose\r\nworthlessness it is unthinkable he should not have realized.\r\n\r\n“According to the general opinion of the day, which in all probability\r\nwas correct, Cesare was the murderer of his brother.”\r\n\r\nThus Gregorovius in his Lucrezia Borgia. A deliberate misstatement! For,\r\nas we have been at pains to show, not until the crime had been fastened\r\nupon everybody whom public opinion could conceive to be a possible\r\nassassin, not until nearly a year after Gandia’s death did rumour for\r\nthe first time connect Cesare with the deed. Until then the ambassadors’\r\nletters from Rome in dealing with the murder and reporting speculation\r\nupon possible murderers never make a single allusion to Cesare as the\r\nguilty person.\r\n\r\nLater, when once it had been bruited, it found its way into the writings\r\nof every defamer of the Borgias, and from several of these it is taken\r\nby Gregorovius to help him uphold that theory.\r\n\r\nTwo motives were urged for the crime. One was Cesare’s envy of his\r\nbrother, whom he desired to supplant as a secular prince, fretting\r\nin the cassock imposed upon himself which restrained his unbounded\r\nambition. The other--and no epoch but this one under consideration,\r\nin its reaction from the age of chivalry, could have dared to level it\r\nwithout a careful examination of its sources--was Cesare’s jealousy,\r\nspringing from the incestuous love for their sister Lucrezia, which he\r\nis alleged to have disputed with his brother. Thus, as l’Espinois has\r\npointed out, to convict Cesare Borgia of a crime which cannot absolutely\r\nbe proved against him, all that is necessary is that he should be\r\ncharged with another crime still more horrible of which even less proof\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nThis latter motive, it is true, is rejected by Gregorovius. “Our sense\r\nof honesty,” he writes, “repels us from attaching faith to the belief\r\nspread in that most corrupt age.” Yet the authorities urging one motive\r\nare commonly those urging the other, and Gregorovius quotes those that\r\nsuit him, without considering that, if he is convinced they lie in one\r\nconnection, he has not the right to assume them truthful in another.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary, or quasi-contemporary writers upon whose “authority”\r\n it is usual to show that Cesare Borgia was guilty of both those\r\nrevolting crimes are: Sanazzaro, Capello, Macchiavelli, Matarazzo,\r\nSanuto, Pietro Martire d’Anghiera, Guicciardini, and Panvinio.\r\n\r\nA formidable array! But consider them, one by one, at close quarters,\r\nand take a critical look at what they actually wrote:\r\n\r\nSANAZZARO was a Neapolitan poet and epigrammatist, who could not--his\r\ntimes being what they were--be expected to overlook the fact that\r\nin these slanderous rumours of incest was excellent matter for\r\nepigrammatical verse. Therefore, he crystallized them into lines which,\r\nwhilst doing credit to his wit, reveal his brutal cruelty. No one will\r\nseriously suppose that such a man would be concerned with the veracity\r\nof the matter of his verses--even leaving out of the question his enmity\r\ntowards the House of Borgia, which will transpire later. For him a ben\r\ntrovato was as good matter as a truth, or better. He measured its value\r\nby its piquancy, by its adaptability to epigrammatic rhymes.\r\n\r\nConceive the heartlessness of the man who, at the moment of Alexander’s\r\nawful grief at the murder of his son--a grief which so moved even\r\nhis enemies that the bitter Savonarola, and the scarcely less bitter\r\nCardinal della Rovere, wrote to condole with him--could pen that\r\nterrible epigram:\r\n\r\n     Piscatorem hominum ne te non, Sexte, putemus,\r\n     Piscaris notum retibus ecce tuum.\r\n\r\nConsider the ribaldry of that, and ask yourselves whether this is a man\r\nwho would immolate the chance of a witticism upon the altar of Truth.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that Sanazzaro, for what he may be worth, confines\r\nhimself to the gossip of incest. Nowhere does he mention that Cesare was\r\nthe murderer, and we think that his silence upon the matter, if it shows\r\nanything, shows that Cesare’s guilt was not so very much the “general\r\nopinion of the day,” as Gregorovius asks us to believe.\r\n\r\nCAPPELLO was not in Rome at the time of the murder, nor until three\r\nyears later, when he merely repeated the rumour that had first sprung up\r\nsome eight months after the crime.\r\n\r\nThe precise value of his famous “relation” (in which this matter is\r\nrecorded, and to which we shall return in its proper place) and the\r\nspirit that actuated him is revealed in another accusation of murder\r\nwhich he levels at Cesare, an accusation which, of course, has also been\r\nwidely disseminated upon no better authority than his own. It is Capello\r\nwho tells us that Cesare stabbed the chamberlain Perrotto in the Pope’s\r\nvery arms; he adds the details that the man had fled thither for shelter\r\nfrom Cesare’s fury, and that the blood of him, when he was stabbed,\r\nspurted up into the very face of the Pope. Where he got the story is\r\nnot readily surmised--unless it be assumed that he evolved it out of his\r\nfeelings for the Borgias. The only contemporary accounts of the death of\r\nthis Perrotto--or Pedro Caldes, as was his real name--state that he fell\r\nby accident into the Tiber and was drowned.\r\n\r\nBurchard, who could not have failed to know if the stabbing story had\r\nbeen true, and would not have failed to report it, chronicles the\r\nfact that Perrotto was fished out of Tiber, having fallen in six days\r\nearlier--“non libenter.” This statement, coming from the pen of the\r\nMaster of Ceremonies at the Vatican, requires no further corroboration.\r\nYet corroboration there actually is in a letter from Rome of February\r\n20, 1498, quoted by Marino Sanuto in his Diarii. This states that\r\nPerrotto had been missing for some days, no one knowing what had become\r\nof him, and that now “he has been found drowned in the Tiber.”\r\n\r\nWe mention this, in passing, with the twofold object of slaying another\r\ncalumny, and revealing the true value of Capello, who happens to be the\r\nchief “witness for the prosecution” put forward by Gregorovius. “Is it\r\nnot of great significance,” inquires the German historian, “that\r\nthe fact should have been related so positively by an ambassador who\r\nobtained his knowledge from the best sources?”\r\n\r\nThe question is frivolous, for the whole trouble in this matter is that\r\nthere were no sources at all, in the proper sense of the word--good or\r\nbad. There was simply gossip, which had been busy with a dozen names\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nMACCHIAVELLI includes a note in his Extracts from Letters to the Ten, in\r\nwhich he mentions the death of Gandia, adding that “at first nothing was\r\nknown, and then men said it was done by the Cardinal of Valencia.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very conclusive in that. Besides, incidentally it\r\nmay be mentioned, that it is not clear when or how these extracts were\r\ncompiled by Macchiavelli (in his capacity of Secretary to the Signory\r\nof Florence) from the dispatches of her ambassadors. But it has been\r\nshown--though we are hardly concerned with that at the moment--that\r\nthese extracts are confused by comments of his own, either for his own\r\nfuture use or for that of another.\r\n\r\nMATARAZZO is the Perugian chronicler of whom we have already expressed\r\nthe only tenable opinion. The task he set himself was to record\r\nthe contemporary events of his native town--the stronghold of the\r\nblood-dripping Baglioni. He enlivened it by every scrap of scandalous\r\ngossip that reached him, however alien to his avowed task. The\r\nauthenticity of this scandalmongering chronicle has been questioned;\r\nbut, even assuming it to be authentic, it is so wildly inaccurate when\r\ndealing with matters happening beyond the walls of Perugia as to be\r\nutterly worthless.\r\n\r\nMatarazzo relates the story of the incestuous relations prevailing in\r\nthe Borgia family, and with an unsparing wealth of detail not to be\r\nfound elsewhere; but on the subject of the murder he has a tale to tell\r\nentirely different from any other that has been left us. For, whilst he\r\nurges the incest as the motive of the crime, the murderer, he tells us,\r\nwas Giovanni Sforza, the outraged husband; and he gives us the fullest\r\ndetails of that murder, time and place and exactly how committed, and\r\nall the other matters which have never been brought to light.\r\n\r\nIt is all a worthless, garbled piece of fiction, most obviously; as such\r\nit has ever been treated; but it is as plausible as it is untrue, and,\r\nat least, as authoritative as any available evidence assigning the guilt\r\nto Cesare.\r\n\r\nSANUTO we accept as a more or less careful and painstaking chronicler,\r\nwhose writings are valuable; and Sanuto on the matter of the murder\r\nconfines himself to quoting the letter of February 1498, in which the\r\naccusation against Cesare is first mentioned, after having given other\r\nearlier letters which accuse first Ascanio and then Orsini far more\r\npositively than does the latter letter accuse Cesare.\r\n\r\nOn the matter of the incest there is no word in Sanuto; but there is\r\nmention of Doña Sancia’s indiscretions, and the suggestion that, through\r\njealousy on her account, it was rumoured that the murder had been\r\ncommitted--another proof of how vague and ill-defined the rumours were.\r\n\r\nPIETRO MARTIRE D’ANGHIERA writes from Burgos, in Spain, that he\r\nis convinced of the fratricide. It is interesting to know of that\r\nconviction of his; but difficult to conceive how it is to be accepted as\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIf more needs to be said of him, let it be mentioned that the letter\r\nin which he expresses that conviction is dated April 1497--two months\r\nbefore the murder took place! So that even Gregorovius is forced to\r\ndoubt the authenticity of that document.\r\n\r\nGUICCIARDINI is not a contemporary chronicler of events as they\r\nhappened, but an historian writing some thirty years later. He merely\r\nrepeats what Capello and others have said before him. It is for him\r\nto quote authorities for what he writes, and not to be set up as an\r\nauthority. He is not reliable, and he is a notorious defamer of the\r\nPapacy, sparing nothing that will serve his ends. He dilates with gusto\r\nupon the accusation of incest.\r\n\r\nLastly, PANVINTO is in the same category as Guicciardini. He was not\r\nborn until some thirty years after these events, and his History of the\r\nPopes was not written until some sixty years after the murder of the\r\nDuke of Gandia. This history bristles with inaccuracies; he never\r\ntroubles to verify his facts, and as an authority he is entirely\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\nIn the valuable Diarium of Burchard there is unfortunately a lacuna at\r\nthis juncture, from the day after the murder (of which he gives the full\r\nparticulars to which we have gone for our narrative of that event) until\r\nthe month of August following. And now we may see Gregorovius actually\r\nusing silence as evidence. He seizes upon that lacuna, and goes so far\r\nas to set up the tentative explanation that Burchard “perhaps purposely\r\ninterrupted his Diary that he might avoid mentioning the fratricide.”\r\n\r\nIf such were the case, it would be a strange departure from Burchard’s\r\ninvariable rule, which is one of cold, relentless, uncritical\r\nchronicling of events, no matter what their nature. Besides, any\r\nsignificance with which that lacuna might be invested is discounted by\r\nthe fact that such gaps are of fairly common occurrence in the course\r\nof Burchard’s record. Finally it remains to be shown that the lacuna\r\nin question exists in the original diaries, which have yet to be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nSo much for the valuable authorities, out of which--and by means of a\r\nselection which is not quite clearly defined--Gregorovius claims to have\r\nproved that the murderer of the Duke of Gandia was his brother Cesare\r\nBorgia, Cardinal of Valencia.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  It is rather odd that, in the course of casting about for a possible\r\nmurderer of Gandia, public opinion should never have fastened upon\r\nCardinal Alessandro Farnese. He had lately been stripped of the\r\nPatrimony of St. Peter that the governorship of this might be bestowed\r\nupon Gandia; his resentment had been provoked by that action of the\r\nPope’s, and the relations between himself and the Borgias were strained\r\nin consequence. Possibly there was clear proof that he could have had no\r\nconnection with the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow to examine more closely the actual motives given by those\r\nauthorities and by later, critical writers, for attributing the guilt to\r\nCesare.\r\n\r\nIn September of the year 1497, the Pope had dissolved the marriage\r\nof his daughter Lucrezia and Giovanni Sforza, and the grounds for\r\nthe dissolution were that the husband was impotens et frigidus\r\nnatura--admitted by himself.(2)\r\n\r\n\r\n  2  “El S. de Pesaro ha scripto qua de sua mano non haverla mai\r\ncognosciuta et esser impotente, alias la sententia non se potea dare. El\r\nprefato S. dice pero haver scripto cosi per obedire el Duca de Milano et\r\nAschanio” (Collenuccio’s letter from Rome to the Duke of Ferrara, Dec.\r\n25, 1497).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know anything of the Italy of to-day, you will be able to\r\nconceive for yourself how the Italy of the fifteenth century must have\r\nheld her sides and pealed her laughter at the contemptible spectacle of\r\nan unfortunate who afforded such reason to be bundled out of a nuptial\r\nbed. The echo of that mighty burst of laughter must have rung from\r\nCalabria to the Alps, and well may it have filled the handsome weakling\r\nwho was the object of its cruel ridicule with a talion fury. The\r\nweapons he took up wherewith to defend himself were a little obvious. He\r\nanswered the odious reflections upon his virility by a wholesale charge\r\nof incest against the Borgia family; he screamed that what had been said\r\nof him was a lie invented by the Borgias to serve their own unutterable\r\nends.(1) Such was the accusation with which the squirming Lord of Pesaro\r\nretaliated, and, however obvious, yet it was not an accusation that\r\nthe world of his day would lightly cast aside, for all that the\r\nperspicacious may have rated it at its proper value.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 “Et mancho se e curato de fare prova de qua con Done per poterne\r\nchiarire el Rev. Legato che era qua, sebbene sua Excellentia tastandolo\r\nsopra cio gli ne abbia facto offerta.” And further: “Anzi haverla\r\nconosciuta infinite volte, ma chel Papa non geiha tolta per altro se\r\nnon per usare con lei” (Costabili’s letter from Milan to the Duke of\r\nFerrara, June 23, 1497).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is of great importance to students of the history of the Borgias is\r\nthat this was the first occasion on which the accusation of incest was\r\nraised. Of course it persisted; such a charge could not do otherwise.\r\nBut now that we see in what soil it had its roots we shall know what\r\nimportance to attach to it.\r\n\r\nNot only did it persist, but it developed, as was but natural. Cesare\r\nand the dead Gandia were included in it, and presently it suggested\r\na motive--not dreamed of until then--why Cesare might have been his\r\nbrother’s murderer.\r\n\r\nThen, early in 1498, came the rumour that Cesare was intending to\r\nabandon the purple, and later Writers, from Capello down to our own\r\ntimes, have chosen to see in Cesare’s supposed contemplation of that\r\nstep a motive so strong for the crime as to prove it in the most\r\nabsolutely conclusive manner. In no case could it be such proof, even\r\nif it were admitted as a motive. But is it really so to be admitted? Did\r\nsuch a motive exist at all? Does it really follow--as has been taken\r\nfor granted--that Cesare must have remained an ecclesiastic had Gandia\r\nlived? We cannot see that it does. Indeed, such evidence as there is,\r\nwhen properly considered, points in the opposite direction, even if no\r\naccount is taken of the fact that this was not the first occasion on\r\nwhich it was proposed that Cesare should abandon the ecclesiastical\r\ncareer, as is shown by the Ferrarese ambassador’s dispatches of March\r\n1493.\r\n\r\nIt is contended that Gandia was a stumbling-block to Cesare, and that\r\nGandia held the secular possessions which Cesare coveted; but if that\r\nwere really the case why, when eventually (some fourteen months after\r\nGandia’s death) Cesare doffed the purple to replace it by a soldier’s\r\nharness, did he not assume the secular possessions that had been his\r\nbrother’s?\r\n\r\nHis dead brother’s lands and titles went to his dead brother’s son,\r\nwhilst Cesare’s career was totally different, as his aims were totally\r\ndifferent, from any that had been Gandia’s, or that might have been\r\nGandia’s had the latter lived. True, Cesare became Captain-General of\r\nthe Church in his dead brother’s place; but for that his brother’s death\r\nwas not necessary. Gandia had neither the will nor the intellect\r\nto undertake the things that awaited Cesare. He was a soft-natured,\r\npleasure-loving youth, whose way of life was already mapped out for him.\r\nHis place was at Gandia, in Spain, and, whilst he might have continued\r\nlord of all the possessions that were his, it would have been Cesare’s\r\nto become Duke of Valentinois, and to have made himself master of\r\nRomagna, precisely as he did.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gandia’s death no more advanced, than his life could have\r\nimpeded, the career which Cesare afterwards made his own, and to say\r\nthat Cesare murdered him to supplant him is to set up a theory which the\r\nsubsequent facts of Cesare’s life will nowise justify.\r\n\r\nIt is idle of Gregorovius to say that the logic of the crime is\r\ninexorable--in its assigning the guilt to Cesare--fatuous of him to\r\nsuppose that, as he claims, he has definitely proved Cesare to be his\r\nbrother’s murderer.\r\n\r\nThere is much against Cesare Borgia, but it never has been proved, and\r\nnever will be proved, that he was a fratricide. Indeed the few really\r\nknown facts of the murder all point to a very different conclusion--a\r\nconclusion more or less obvious, which has been discarded, presumably\r\nfor no better reason than because it was obvious.\r\n\r\nWhere was all this need to go so far afield in quest of a probable\r\nmurderer imbued with political motives? Where the need to accuse in turn\r\nevery enemy that Gandia could possibly possess before finally fastening\r\nupon his own brother?\r\n\r\nCertain evidence is afforded by the known facts of the case, scant as\r\nthey are. It may not amount to much, but at least it is sufficient\r\nto warrant a plausible conclusion, and there is no justification\r\nfor discarding it in favour of something for which not a particle of\r\nevidence is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThere is, first of all, the man in the mask to be accounted for. That\r\nhe is connected with the crime is eminently probable, if not absolutely\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that for a month--according to Burchard--he\r\nhad been in the habit of visiting Gandia almost daily. He comes to\r\nVannozza’s villa on the night of the murder. Is it too much to suppose\r\nthat he brought a message from some one from whom he was in the habit of\r\nbringing messages?\r\n\r\nHe was seen last on the crupper of Gandia’s horse as the latter rode\r\naway towards the Jewish quarter.(1) Gandia himself announced that he was\r\nbound on pleasure--going to amuse himself. Even without the knowledge\r\nwhich we possess of his licentious habits, no doubt could arise as to\r\nthe nature of the amusement upon which he was thus bound at dead of\r\nnight; and there are the conclusions formed in the morning by his\r\nfather, when it was found that Gandia had not returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The Ghetto was not yet in existence.  It was not built until 1556,\r\nunder Paul IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it so very difficult to conceive that Gandia, in the course of the\r\nassignation to which he went, should have fallen into the hands of\r\nan irate father, husband, or brother? Is it not really the obvious\r\ninference to draw from the few facts that we possess? That it was the\r\ninference drawn by the Pope and clung to even some time after the\r\ncrime and while rumours of a different sort were rife, is shown by the\r\nperquisition made in the house of Antonio Pico della Mirandola, who had\r\na daughter whom it was conceived might have been the object of the young\r\nduke’s nocturnal visit, and whose house was near the place where Gandia\r\nwas flung into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nWe could hazard speculations that would account for the man in the mask,\r\nbut it is not our business to speculate save where the indications are\r\nfairly clear.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the significance of Gandia’s tied hands and the wounds\r\nupon his body in addition to the mortal gash across his throat. To what\r\ndoes this condition point? Surely not to a murder of expediency so much\r\nas to a fierce, lustful butchery of vengeance. Surely it suggests that\r\nGandia may have been tortured before his throat was cut. Why else were\r\nhis wrists pinioned? Had he been swiftly done to death there would have\r\nbeen no need for that. Had hired assassins done the work they would not\r\nhave stayed to pinion him, nor do we think they would have troubled to\r\nfling him into the river; they would have slain and left him where he\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nThe whole aspect of the case suggests the presence of the master, of the\r\npersonal enemy himself. We can conceive Gandia’s wrists being tied, to\r\nthe end that this personal enemy might do his will upon the wretched\r\nyoung man, dealing him one by one the ten or fourteen wounds in the body\r\nbefore making an end of him by cutting his throat. We cannot explain\r\nthe pinioned wrists in any other way. Then the man on the handsome white\r\nhorse, the man whom the four others addressed as men address their lord.\r\nRemember his gold spurs--a trifle, perhaps; but hired assassins do not\r\nwear gold spurs, even though their bestriding handsome white horses may\r\nbe explainable.\r\n\r\nSurely that was the master, the personal enemy himself--and it was not\r\nCesare, for Cesare at the time was at the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThere we must leave the mystery of the murder of the Duke of Gandia; but\r\nwe leave it convinced that, such scant evidence as there is, points to\r\nan affair of sordid gallantry, and nowise implicates his brother Cesare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE RENUNCIATION OF THE PURPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Consistory of June 19, 1497 the Sacred College beheld a\r\nbroken-hearted old man who declared that he had done with the world, and\r\nthat henceforth life could offer him nothing that should endear it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“A greater sorrow than this could not be ours, for we loved him\r\nexceedingly, and now we can hold neither the Papacy nor any other thing\r\nas of concern. Had we seven Papacies, we would give them all to restore\r\nthe duke to life.” So ran his bitter lament.\r\n\r\nHe denounced his course of life as not having been all that it should\r\nhave been, and appeared to see in the murder of his son a punishment\r\nfor the evil of his ways. Much has been made of this, and quite\r\nunnecessarily. It has been taken eagerly as an admission of his\r\nunparalleled guilt. An admission of guilt it undoubtedly was; but what\r\nman is not guilty? and how many men--ay, and saints even--in the hour of\r\ntribulation have cried out that they were being made to feel the wrath\r\nof God for the sins that no man is without?\r\n\r\nIf humanity contains a type that would not have seen in such a cause for\r\nsorrow a visitation of God, it is the type of inhuman monster to\r\nwhich we are asked to believe that Alexander VI belonged. A sinner\r\nunquestionably he was, and a great one; but a human sinner, and not an\r\nincarnate devil, else there could have been no such outcry from him in\r\nsuch an hour as this.\r\n\r\nHe announced that henceforth the spiritual needs of the Church should be\r\nhis only care. He inveighed against the corruption of the ecclesiastical\r\nestate, confessing himself aware of how far it had strayed from the\r\nancient discipline and from the laws that had been framed to bridle\r\nlicence and cupidity, which were now rampant and unchecked; and he\r\nproclaimed his intention to reform the Curia and the Church of Rome. To\r\nthis end he appointed a commission consisting of the Cardinal-Bishops\r\nOliviero Caraffa and Giorgio Costa, the Cardinal-Priests Antonietto\r\nPallavicino and Gianantonio Sangiorgio, and the Cardinal-Deacons\r\nFrancesco Piccolomini and Raffaele Riario.\r\n\r\nThere was even a suggestion that he was proposing to abdicate, but that\r\nhe was prevailed upon to do nothing until his grief should have abated\r\nand his judgement be restored to its habitual calm. This suggestion,\r\nhowever, rests upon no sound authority.\r\n\r\nLetters of condolence reached him on every hand. Even his arch-enemy,\r\nCardinal Giuliano della Rovere, put aside his rancour in the face of the\r\nPope’s overwhelming grief--and also because it happened to consort with\r\nhis own interests, as will presently transpire. He wrote to Alexander\r\nfrom France that he was truly pained to the very soul of him in his\r\nconcern for the Pope’s Holiness--a letter which, no doubt, laid the\r\nfoundations to the reconciliation that was toward between them.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable was it that the thaumaturgical Savonarola should\r\nhave paused in the atrabilious invective with which he was inflaming\r\nFlorence against the Pope, should have paused to send him a letter of\r\ncondolence in which he prayed that the Lord of all mercy might comfort\r\nhis Holiness in his tribulation.\r\n\r\nThat letter is a singular document; singularly human, yielding a\r\nsingular degree of insight into the nature of the man who penned it.\r\nA whole chapter of intelligent speculation upon the character of\r\nSavonarola, based upon a study of externals, could not reveal as much of\r\nthe mentality of that fanatical demagogue as the consideration of just\r\nthis letter.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy by which we cannot doubt it to have been primarily inspired\r\nis here overspread by the man’s rampant fanaticism, there diluted by the\r\nprophecies from which he cannot even now refrain; and, throughout, the\r\nmanner is that of the pulpit-thumping orator. The first half of his\r\nletter is a prelude in the form of a sermon upon Faith, all very trite\r\nand obvious; and the notion of this excommunicated friar holding forth\r\nto the Pope’s Holiness in polemical platitudes delivered with all the\r\nauthority of inspired discoveries of his own is one more proof that at\r\nthe root of fanaticism in all ages and upon all questions, lies an utter\r\nlack of a sense of fitness and proportion. Having said that “the just\r\nman liveth in the Lord by faith,” and that “the Lord in His mercy\r\npasseth over all our sins,” he proclaims that he announces things\r\nof which he is assured, and for which he is ready to suffer all\r\npersecutions, and begs his Holiness to turn a favourable eye upon the\r\nwork of faith in which he is labouring, and to give heed no more to the\r\nimpious, promising the Holy Father that thus shall the Lord bestow upon\r\nhim the essence of joy instead of the spirit of grief. Having begun, as\r\nwe have seen, with an assurance that “the Lord in His mercy passeth over\r\nall our sins,” he concludes by prophesying, with questionable logic,\r\nthat “the thunders of His wrath will ere long be heard.” Nor does he\r\nomit to mention--with an apparent arrogance that again betrays that same\r\nwant of a sense of proportion--that all his predictions are true.\r\n\r\nHis letter, however, and that of Cardinal della Rovere, among so\r\nmany others, show us how touched was the world by the Pope’s loss and\r\noverwhelming grief, how shocked at the manner in which this had been\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nThe commission which Alexander had appointed for the work of reform had\r\nmeanwhile got to work, and the Cardinal of Naples edited the articles of\r\na constitution which was undoubtedly the object of prolonged study and\r\nconsideration, as is revealed by the numerous erasures and emendations\r\nwhich it bears. Unfortunately--for reasons which are not apparent--it\r\nwas never published by Alexander. Possibly by the time that it was\r\nconcluded the aggrandizement of the temporal power was claiming his\r\nentire attention to the neglect of the spiritual needs of the Holy See.\r\nIt is also possible--as has been abundantly suggested--that the stern\r\nmood of penitence had softened with his sorrow, and was now overpast.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it may have been some lingering remnant of this fervour of\r\nreform that dictated the severe punishment which fell that year upon the\r\nflagitious Bishop of Cosenza. A fine trade was being driven in Rome by\r\nthe sale of forged briefs of indulgence. Raynaldus cites a Bull on that\r\nscore addressed by Alexander, in the first year of his pontificate, to\r\nthe bishops of Spain, enjoining them to visit with punishment all who\r\nin that kingdom should be discovered to be pursuing such a traffic. On\r\nSeptember 4, 1497, Burchard tells us, three servants of the Pontifical\r\nSecretary, the Archbishop of Cosenza (Bartolomeo Florido) were arrested\r\nin consequence of the discovery of twenty forged briefs issued by them.\r\nIn their examination they incriminated their master the archbishop, who\r\nwas consequently put upon his trial and found guilty. Alexander deposed,\r\ndegraded, and imprisoned him in Sant’ Angelo in a dark room, where\r\nhe was supplied with oil for his lamp and bread and water for his\r\nnourishment until he died. His underlings were burnt in the Campo di\r\nFiori in the following month.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Gandia left a widow and two children--Giovanni, a boy of\r\nthree years of age, and Isabella, a girl of two. In the interests of\r\nher son, the widowed duchess applied to the Governor of Valencia in\r\nthe following September for the boy’s investiture in the rights of his\r\ndeceased father. This was readily granted upon authority from Rome, and\r\nso the boy Giovanni was recognized as third Duke of Gandia, Prince\r\nof Sessa and Teano, and Lord of Cerignola and Montefoscolo, and the\r\nadministration of his estates during his minority was entrusted to his\r\nuncle, Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nThe Lordship of Benevento--the last grant made to Giovanni Borgia--was\r\nnot mentioned; nor was it then nor ever subsequently claimed by the\r\nwidow. It is the one possession of Gandia’s that went to Cesare, who was\r\nconfirmed in it by the King of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe Gandia branch of the Borgia family remained in Spain, prospered and\r\ngrew in importance, and, incidentally, produced St. Francis de Borgia.\r\nThis Duke of Gandia was Master of the Household to Charles V, and thus\r\na man of great worldly consequence; but it happened that he was so moved\r\nby the sight of the disfigured body of his master’s beautiful queen\r\nthat he renounced the world and entered the Society of Jesus, eventually\r\nbecoming its General. He died in 1562, and in the fulness of time was\r\ncanonized.\r\n\r\nCesare’s departure for Naples as legate a latere to anoint and crown\r\nFederigo of Aragon was naturally delayed by the tragedy that had\r\nassailed his house, and not until July 22 did he take his leave of the\r\nPope and set out with an escort of two hundred horse.\r\n\r\nNaples was still in a state of ferment, split into two parties, one of\r\nwhich favoured France and the other Aragon, so that disturbances were\r\ncontinual. Alexander expressed the hope that Cesare might appear in that\r\ndistracted kingdom in the guise of an “angel of peace,” and that by his\r\ncoronation of King Federigo he should set a term to the strife that was\r\ntoward.\r\n\r\nThe city of Naples itself was now being ravaged by fever, and in\r\nconsequence of this it was determined that Cesare should repair instead\r\nto Capua, where Federigo would await him. Arrived there, however, Cesare\r\nfell ill, and the coronation ceremony again suffered a postponement\r\nuntil August 10. Cesare remained a fortnight in the kingdom, and on\r\nAugust 22 set out to return to Rome, and his departure appears to have\r\nbeen a matter of relief to Federigo, for so impoverished did the King\r\nof Naples find himself that the entertainment of the legate and his\r\nnumerous escort had proved a heavy tax upon his flabby purse.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 6 all the cardinals in Rome received a\r\nsummons to attend at the Monastery of Santa Maria Nuova to welcome the\r\nreturned Cardinal of Valencia. In addition to the Sacred College all the\r\nambassadors of the Powers were present, and, after the celebration of\r\nthe Mass, the entire assembly proceeded to the Vatican, where the\r\nPope was waiting to receive his son. When the young cardinal presented\r\nhimself at the foot of the papal throne Alexander opened his arms to\r\nhim, embraced, and kissed him, speaking no word.\r\n\r\nThis rests upon the evidence of two eye-witnesses,(1) and the\r\ncircumstance has been urged and propounded into the one conclusive piece\r\nof evidence that Cesare had murdered his brother, and that the Pope knew\r\nit. In this you have some more of what Gregorovius terms “inexorable\r\nlogic.” He kissed him, but he spake no word to him; therefore, they\r\nreason, Cesare murdered Gandia. Can absurdity be more absurd, fatuity\r\nmore fatuous? Lucus a non lucendo! To square the circle should surely\r\npresent no difficulty to these subtle logicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Non dixit verbum Pape Valentinus, nec Papa sibi, sed eo deosculato,\r\ndescendit de solio” (Burchard’s Diarium, and “Solo lo bació,” in letter\r\nfrom Rome in Sanuto’s Diarii)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, as we have seen, in February of 1498 that it was first rumoured\r\nthat Cesare intended to put off the purple; and that the rumour had\r\nample foundation was plain from the circumstance that the Pope was\r\nalready laying plans whose fulfilment must be dependent upon that step,\r\nand seeking to arrange a marriage for Cesare with Carlotta of Aragon,\r\nKing Federigo of Naples’s daughter, stipulating that her dowry should\r\nbe such that Cesare, in taking her to wife, should become Prince of\r\nAltamura and Tarentum.\r\n\r\nBut Federigo showed himself unwilling, possibly in consideration of\r\nthe heavy dowry demanded and of the heavy draft already made by the\r\nBorgias--through Giuffredo Borgia, Prince of Squillace--upon this Naples\r\nwhich the French invasion had so impoverished. He gave out that he would\r\nnot have his daughter wedded to a priest who was the son of a priest and\r\nthat he would not give his daughter unless the Pope could contrive that\r\na cardinal might marry and yet retain his hat.\r\n\r\nIt all sounded as if he were actuated by nice scruples and high\r\nprinciples; but the opinion is unfortunately not encouraged when we\r\nfind him, nevertheless, giving his consent to the marriage of his nephew\r\nAlfonso to Lucrezia Borgia upon the pronouncement of her divorce from\r\nGiovanni Sforza. The marriage, let us say in passing, was celebrated\r\nat the Vatican on June 20, 1498, Lucrezia receiving a dowry of 40,000\r\nducats. But the astute Alexander saw to it that his family should\r\nacquire more than it gave, and contrived that Alfonso should receive the\r\nNeapolitan cities of Biselli and Quadrata, being raised to the title of\r\nPrince of Biselli.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was a vast difference between giving in marriage a\r\ndaughter who must take a weighty dowry out of the kingdom and receiving\r\na daughter who would bring a handsome dowry with her. And the facts\r\nsuggest that such was the full measure of Federigo’s scruples.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to dissemble his reluctance to let Cesare have his daughter\r\nto wife, Federigo urged that he must first take the feeling of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella in this matter.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs stood thus, Charles VIII died suddenly at Amboise in April\r\nof that year 1498. Some work was being carried out there by artists whom\r\nhe had brought from Naples for the purpose, and, in going to visit this,\r\nthe king happened to enter a dark gallery, and struck his forehead so\r\nviolently against the edge of a door that he expired the same day--at\r\nthe age of twenty-eight. He was a poor, malformed fellow, as we have\r\nseen, and “of little understanding,” Commines tells us, “but so good\r\nthat it would have been impossible to have found a kinder creature.”\r\n\r\nWith him the Valois dynasty came to an end. He was succeeded by his\r\ncousin, the Duke of Orleans, who, upon his coronation at Rheims, assumed\r\nthe title of King of France and the Two Sicilies and Duke of Milan--a\r\nmatter which considerably perturbed Federigo of Aragon and Lodovico\r\nSforza. Each of these rulers saw in that assumption of his own title by\r\nLouis XII a declaration of enmity, the prelude to a declaration of open\r\nwar; wherefore, deeming it idle to send their ambassadors to represent\r\nthem at the Court of France, they refrained from doing so.\r\n\r\nLouis XII’s claim upon the Duchy of Milan was based upon his being the\r\ngrandson of Valentina Visconti, and, considering himself a Visconti, he\r\nnaturally looked upon the Sforza dominion as no better than a usurpation\r\nwhich too long had been left undisturbed. To disturb it now was the\r\nfirst aim of his kingship. And to this end, as well as in another\r\nmatter, the friendship of the Pope was very desirable to Louis.\r\n\r\nThe other matter concerned his matrimonial affairs. No sooner did he\r\nfind himself King of France than he applied to Rome for the dissolution\r\nof his marriage with Jeanne de Valois, the daughter of Louis XI. The\r\ngrounds he urged were threefold: Firstly, between himself and Jeanne\r\nthere existed a relationship of the fourth degree and a spiritual\r\naffinity, resulting from the fact that her father, Louis XI, had\r\nheld him at the baptismal font--which before the Council of Trent\r\ndid constitute an impediment to marriage. Secondly, he had not been a\r\nwilling party to the union, but had entered into it as a consequence of\r\nintimidation from the terrible Louis XI, who had threatened his life\r\nand possessions if not obeyed in this. Thirdly, Jeanne laboured under\r\nphysical difficulties which rendered her incapable of maternity.\r\n\r\nOf such a nature was the appeal he made to Alexander, and Alexander\r\nresponded by appointing a commission presided over by the Cardinal of\r\nLuxembourg, and composed of that same cardinal and the Bishops of Albi\r\nand Ceuta, assisted by five other bishops as assessors, to investigate\r\nthe king’s grievance. There appears to be no good reason for assuming\r\nthat the inquiry was not conducted fairly and honourably or that the\r\nfinding of the bishops and ultimate annulment of the marriage was not in\r\naccordance with their consciences. We are encouraged to assume that all\r\nthis was indeed so, when we consider that Jeanne de Valois submitted\r\nwithout protest to the divorce, and that neither then nor subsequently\r\nat any time did she prefer any complaint, accepting the judgement, it is\r\npresumable, as a just and fitting measure.\r\n\r\nShe applied to the Pope for permission to found a religious order, whose\r\nspecial aim should be the adoration and the emulation of the perfections\r\nof the Blessed Virgin, a permission which Alexander very readily\r\naccorded her. He was, himself, imbued with a very special devotion for\r\nthe Mother of the Saviour. We see the spur of this special devotion of\r\nhis in the votive offering of a silver effigy to her famous altar of the\r\nSantissima Nunziata in Florence, which he had promised in the event of\r\nRome being freed from Charles VIII. Again, after the accident of the\r\ncollapse of a roof in the Vatican, in which he narrowly escaped death,\r\nit is to Santa Maria Nuova that we see him going in procession to hold\r\na solemn thanksgiving service to Our Lady. In a dozen different ways\r\ndid that devotion find expression during his pontificate; and be it\r\nremembered that Catholics owe it to Alexander VI that the Angelus-bell\r\nis rung thrice daily in honour of the Blessed Virgin.\r\n\r\nTo us this devotion to the Mother of Chastity on the part of a churchman\r\nopenly unchaste in flagrant subversion of his vows is a strange and\r\nincongruous spectacle. But the incongruity of it is illumining. It\r\nreveals Alexander’s simple attitude towards the sins of the flesh,\r\nand shows how, in common with most churchmen of his day, he found no\r\nconscientious difficulty in combining fervid devotion with perfervid\r\nlicence. Whatever it may seem by ours, by his lights--by the light of\r\nthe examples about him from his youth, by the light of the precedents\r\nafforded him by his predecessors in St. Peter’s Chair--his conduct was\r\na normal enough affair, which can have afforded him little with which to\r\nreproach himself.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the annulment of the marriage of Louis XII it is to\r\nbe conceded that Alexander made the most of the opportunity it afforded\r\nhim. He perceived that the moment was propitious for enlisting the\r\nservices of the King of France to the achievement of his own ends, more\r\nparticularly to further the matter of the marriage of Cesare Borgia\r\nwith Carlotta of Aragon, who was being reared at the Court of France.\r\nAccordingly Alexander desired the Bishop of Ceuta to lay his wishes in\r\nthe matter before the Christian King, and, to the end that Cesare might\r\nfind a fitting secular estate awaiting him when eventually he emerged\r\nfrom the clergy, the Pope further suggested to Louis, through the\r\nbishop’s agency, that Cesare should receive the investiture of the\r\ncounties of Valentinois and Dyois in Dauphiny. On the face of it this\r\nwears the look of inviting bribery. In reality it scarcely amounted\r\nto so much, although the opportunism that prompted the request is\r\nundeniable. Yet it is worthy of consideration that in what concerned the\r\ncounties of Valentinois and Dyois, the Pope’s suggestion constituted\r\na wise political step. These territories had been in dispute between\r\nFrance and the Holy See for a matter of some two hundred years, during\r\nwhich the Popes had been claiming dominion over them. The claims had\r\nbeen admitted by Louis XI, who had relinquished the counties to the\r\nChurch; but shortly after his death the Parliament of Dauphiny had\r\nrestored them to the crown of France. Charles VIII and Innocent VIII had\r\nwrangled over them, and an arbitration was finally projected, but never\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nAlexander now perceived a way to solve the difficulty by a compromise\r\nwhich should enrich his son and give the latter a title to replace that\r\nof cardinal which he was to relinquish. So his proposal to Louis XII was\r\nthat the Church should abandon its claim upon the territories, whilst\r\nthe king, raising Valentinois to the dignity of a duchy, should so\r\nconfer it upon Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proposal was politically sound, it constituted at the same\r\ntime an act of flagrant nepotism. But let us bear in mind that Alexander\r\ndid not lack a precedent for this particular act. When Louis XI had\r\nsurrendered Valentinois to Sixtus IV, this Pope had bestowed it upon\r\nhis nephew Girolamo, thereby vitiating any claim that the Holy See\r\nmight subsequently have upon the territory. We judge it--under the\r\ncircumstances that Louis XI had surrendered it to the Church--to be a\r\nfar more flagrant piece of nepotism than was Alexander’s now.\r\n\r\nLouis XII, nothing behind the Pope in opportunism, saw in the concession\r\nasked of him the chance of acquiring Alexander’s good-will. He\r\nconsented, accompanying his consent by a request for a cardinal’s hat\r\nfor Georges d’Amboise, Bishop of Rouen, who had been his devoted friend\r\nin less prosperous times, and the sharer of his misfortunes under\r\nthe previous reign, and was now his chief counsellor and minister. In\r\naddition he besought--dependent, of course, upon the granting of\r\nthe solicited divorce--a dispensation to marry Anne of Brittany, the\r\nbeautiful widow of Charles VIII. This was Louis’s way of raising the\r\nprice, as it were, of the concession and services asked of him; yet,\r\nthat there might be no semblance of bargaining, his consent to Cesare’s\r\nbeing created Duke of Valentinois was simultaneous with his request for\r\nfurther favours.\r\n\r\nWith the Royal Patents conferring that duchy upon the Pope’s son, Louis\r\nde Villeneuve reached Rome on August 7, 1498. On the same day the young\r\ncardinal came before the Sacred College, assembled in Consistory, to\r\ncrave permission to doff the purple.\r\n\r\nAfter the act of adoration of the Pope’s Holiness, he humbly submitted\r\nto his brother cardinals that his inclinations had ever been in\r\nopposition to his embracing the ecclesiastical dignity, and that, if he\r\nhad entered upon it at all, this had been solely at the instances of his\r\nHoliness, just as he had persevered in it to gratify him; but that, his\r\ninclinations and desires for the secular estate persisting, he implored\r\nthe Holy Father, of his clemency, to permit him to put off his habit and\r\necclesiastical rank, to restore his hat and benefices to the Church, and\r\nto grant him dispensation to return to the world and be free to contract\r\nmarriage. And he prayed the very reverend cardinals to use their good\r\noffices on his behalf, adding to his own their intercessions to the\r\nPope’s Holiness to accord him the grace he sought.\r\n\r\nThe cardinals relegated the decision of the matter to the Pope. Cardinal\r\nXimenes alone--as the representative of Spain--stood out against the\r\ngranting of the solicited dispensation, and threw obstacles in the way\r\nof it. In this, no doubt, he obeyed his instructions from Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, who saw to the bottom of the intrigue with France that was\r\ntoward, and of the alliance that impended between Louis XII and the Holy\r\nSee--an alliance not at all to the interests of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Pope made a speedy rout of the cardinal’s objections with the most\r\napostolic and irresistible of all weapons. He pointed out that it was\r\nnot for him to hinder the Cardinal of Valencia’s renunciation of the\r\npurple, since that renunciation was clearly become necessary for the\r\nsalvation of his soul--“Pro salutae animae suae”--to which, of course,\r\nXimenes had no answer.\r\n\r\nBut, with the object of conciliating Spain, this ever-politic Pope\r\nindicated that, if Cesare was about to become a prince of France, his\r\nmany ecclesiastical benefices, yielding some 35,000 gold florins yearly,\r\nbeing mostly in Spain, would be bestowed upon Spanish churchmen, and he\r\nfurther begged Ximenes to remember that he already had a “nephew” at the\r\nCourt of Spain in the person of the heir of Gandia, whom he particularly\r\ncommended to the favour of Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\n\r\nThus was Cesare Borgia’s petition granted, and his return to the world\r\naccomplished. And, by a strange chance of homonymy, his title remained\r\nunchanged despite his change of estate. The Cardinal of Valencia, in\r\nSpain, became the Duke of Valence--or Valentinois--in France and in\r\nItaly Valentino remained Valentino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III. THE BULL RAMPANT\r\n\r\n“Cum numine Caesaris omen.”\r\n\r\n(motto on Cesare Borgia’s sword.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE DUCHESS OF VALENTINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Louis XII dispatched the Sieur de Sarenon by sea, with a fleet of\r\nthree ships and five galleys, to the end that he should conduct the\r\nnew duke to France, which fleet was delayed so that it did not drop its\r\nanchors at Ostia until the end of September.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cesare’s preparations for departure had been going forward,\r\nand were the occasion of a colossal expenditure on the part of his sire.\r\nFor the Pope desired that his son, in going to France to assume his\r\nestate, and for the further purposes of marrying a wife, of conveying\r\nto Louis the dispensation permitting his marriage with Anne of Brittany,\r\nand of bearing the red hat to Amboise, should display the extraordinary\r\nmagnificence for which the princes of cultured and luxurious Italy were\r\nat the time renowned.\r\n\r\nHis suite consisted of fully a hundred attendants, what with\r\nesquires, pages, lacqueys and grooms, whilst twelve chariots and fifty\r\nsumpter-mules were laden with his baggage. The horses of his followers\r\nwere all sumptuously caparisoned with bridles and stirrups of solid\r\nsilver; and, for the rest, the splendour of the liveries, the weapons\r\nand the jewels, and the richness of the gifts he bore with him were the\r\namazement even of that age of dazzling displays.\r\n\r\nIn Cesare’s train went Ramiro de Lorqua, the Master of his Household;\r\nAgabito Gherardi, his secretary; and his Spanish physician, Gaspare\r\nTorella--the only medical man of his age who had succeeded in\r\ndiscovering a treatment for the pudendagra which the French had left in\r\nItaly, and who had dedicated to Cesare his learned treatise upon that\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAs a body-guard, or escort of honour, Cesare took with him thirty\r\ngentlemen, mostly Romans, among whom were Giangiordano Orsini, Pietro\r\nSanta Croce, Mario di Mariano, Domenico Sanguigna, Giulio Alberini,\r\nBartolomeo Capranica, and Gianbattista Mancini--all young, and all\r\nmembers of those patrician families which Alexander VI had skilfully\r\nattached to his own interest.\r\n\r\nThe latest of these was the Orsini family, with which an alliance was\r\nestablished by the marriage celebrated at the Vatican on September 28 of\r\nthat same year between Fabio Orsini and Girolama Borgia, a niece of the\r\nPope’s.\r\n\r\nCesare’s departure took place on October 1, in the early morning, when\r\nhe rode out with his princely retinue, and followed the Tiber along\r\nTrastevere, without crossing the city. He was mounted on a handsome\r\ncharger, caparisoned in red silk and gold brocade--the colours of\r\nFrance, in which he had also dressed his lacqueys. He wore a doublet\r\nof white damask laced with gold, and carried a mantle of black velvet\r\nswinging from his shoulders. Of black velvet, too, was the cap on his\r\nauburn head, its sable colour an effective background for the ruddy\r\neffulgence of the great rubies--“as large as beans”--with which it was\r\nadorned.\r\n\r\nOf the gentlemen who followed him, the Romans were dressed in the French\r\nmode, like himself, whilst the Spaniards adhered to the fashions of\r\ntheir native Spain.\r\n\r\nHe was escorted as far as the end of the Banchi by four cardinals, and\r\nfrom a window of the Vatican the Pope watched the imposing cavalcade\r\nand followed it with his eyes until it was lost to view, weeping, we\r\nare told, for very joy at the contemplation of the splendour and\r\nmagnificence which it had been his to bestow upon his beloved son--“the\r\nvery heart of him,” as he wrote to the King of France in that letter of\r\nwhich Cesare was the bearer.\r\n\r\nOn October 12 the Duke of Valentinois landed at Marseilles, where he was\r\nreceived by the Bishop of Dijon, whom the king had sent to meet him, and\r\nwho now accompanied the illustrious visitor to Avignon. There Cesare\r\nwas awaited by the Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere. This prelate was now\r\nanxious to make his peace with Alexander--and presently we shall look\r\ninto the motives that probably inspired him, a matter which has so far,\r\nwe fancy, escaped criticism for reasons that we shall also strive to\r\nmake apparent. To the beginnings of a reconciliation with the Pontiff\r\nafforded by his touching letter of condolence on the death of the Duke\r\nof Gandia, he now added a very cordial reception and entertainment of\r\nCesare; and throughout his sojourn in France the latter received at\r\nthe hands of della Rovere the very friendliest treatment, the cardinal\r\nmissing no opportunity of working in the duke’s interests and for the\r\nadvancement of his ends.\r\n\r\nThe Pope wrote to the cardinal commending Cesare to his good graces, and\r\nthe cardinal replied with protestations which he certainly proceeded to\r\nmake good.\r\n\r\nDella Rovere was to escort Cesare to the king, who was with his Court\r\nthen at Chinon, awaiting the completion of the work that was being\r\ncarried out at his Castle of Blois, which presently became his chief\r\nresidence. But Cesare appears to have tarried in Avignon, for he was\r\nstill there at the end of October, nor did he reach Chinon until the\r\nmiddle of December. The pomp of his entrance was a thing stupendous. We\r\nfind a detailed relation of it in Brantôme, translated into prose\r\nform some old verses which, he tells us, that he found in the family\r\ntreasury. He complains of their coarseness, and those who are acquainted\r\nwith the delightful old Frenchman’s own frankness of expression may\r\nwell raise their brows at that criticism of his. Whatever the coarse\r\nliberties taken with the subject--of which we are not allowed more than\r\nan occasional glimpse--and despite the fact that the relation was\r\nin verse, which ordinarily makes for the indulgence of the rhymer’s\r\nfancy--the description appears to be fairly accurate, for it corresponds\r\nmore or less with the particulars given in Sanuto.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the cavalcade went twenty-four sumpter-mules, laden with\r\ncoffers and other baggage under draperies embroidered with Cesare’s\r\narms--prominent among which would be the red bull, the emblem of his\r\nhouse, and the three-pointed flame, his own particular device. Behind\r\nthese came another twenty-four mules, caparisoned in the king’s colours\r\nof scarlet and gold, to be followed in their turn by sixteen beautiful\r\nchargers led by hand, similarly caparisoned, and their bridles and\r\nstirrups of solid silver. Next came eighteen pages on horseback, sixteen\r\nof whom were in scarlet and yellow, whilst the remaining two were in\r\ncloth of gold. These were followed by a posse of lacqueys in the same\r\nliveries and two mules laden with coffers draped with cloth of gold,\r\nwhich contained the gifts of which Cesare was the bearer. Behind these\r\nrode the duke’s thirty gentlemen, in cloth of gold and silver, and\r\namongst them came the duke himself.\r\n\r\nCesare was mounted on a superb war-horse that was all empanoplied in a\r\ncuirass of gold leaves of exquisite workmanship, its head surmounted\r\nby a golden artichoke, its tail confined in a net of gold abundantly\r\nstudded with pearls. The duke was in black velvet, through the slashings\r\nof which appeared the gold brocade of the undergarment. Suspended from\r\na chain said by Brantôme’s poet to be worth thirty thousand ducats, a\r\nmedallion of diamonds blazed upon his breast, and in his black velvet\r\ncap glowed those same wonderful rubies that we saw on the occasion of\r\nhis departure from Rome. His boots were of black velvet, laced with gold\r\nthread that was studded with gems.\r\n\r\nThe rear of the cavalcade was brought up by more mules and the chariots\r\nbearing his plate and tents and all the other equipage with which a\r\nprince was wont to travel.\r\n\r\nIt is said by some that his horse was shod with solid gold, and there is\r\nalso a story--pretty, but probably untrue--that some of his mules were\r\nshod in the same metal, and that, either because the shoes were loosely\r\nattached of intent, or because the metal, being soft, parted readily\r\nfrom the hoofs, these golden shoes were freely cast and left as largesse\r\nfor those who might care to take them.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Rouen--that same Georges d’Amboise for whom he was\r\nbringing the red hat--the Seneschal of Toulouse and several gentlemen\r\nof the Court went to meet him on the bridge, and escorted him up through\r\nthe town to the castle, where the king awaited him. Louis XII gave him\r\na warm and cordial welcome, showing him then and thereafter the\r\nfriendliest consideration. Not so, however, the lady he was come to woo.\r\nIt was said in Venice that she was in love with a young Breton gentleman\r\nin the following of Queen Anne. Whether this was true, and Carlotta\r\nacted in the matter in obedience to her own feelings, or whether she\r\nwas merely pursuing the instructions she had received from Naples, she\r\nobstinately and absolutely refused to entertain or admit the suit of\r\nCesare.\r\n\r\nDella Rovere, on January 18, wrote to the Pope from Nantes, whither the\r\nCourt had moved, a letter in which he sang the praises of the young Duke\r\nof Valentinois.\r\n\r\n“By his modesty his readiness, his prudence, and his other virtues he\r\nhas known how to earn the affections of every one.” Unfortunately, there\r\nwas one important exception, as the cardinal was forced to add: “The\r\ndamsel, either out of her own contrariness, or because so induced by\r\nothers, which is easier to believe, constantly refuses to hear of the\r\nwedding.”\r\n\r\nDella Rovere was quite justified in finding it easier to believe that\r\nCarlotta was acting upon instructions from others, for, when hard\r\npressed to consent to the alliance, she demanded that the Neapolitan\r\nambassador should himself say that her father desired her to do so--a\r\nstatement which, it seems, the ambassador could not bring himself to\r\nmake.\r\n\r\nBaffled by the persistence of that refusal, Cesare all but returned a\r\nbachelor to Italy. So far, indeed, was his departure a settled matter\r\nthat in February of 1489, at the Castle of Loches, he received the\r\nking’s messages for the Pope. Yet Louis hesitated to let him go without\r\nhaving bound his Holiness to his own interests by stronger bonds.\r\n\r\nIn the task of tracing the annals of the Borgias, the honest seeker\r\nafter truth is compelled to proceed axe in hand that he may hack himself\r\na way through the tangle of irresponsible or malicious statements that\r\nhave grown up about this subject, driving their roots deep into the\r\nsoil of history. Not a single chance does malignity, free or chartered,\r\nappear to have missed for the invention of flagitious falsehoods\r\nconcerning this family, or for the no less flagitious misinterpretation\r\nof known facts.\r\n\r\nAmid a mass of written nonsense dealing with Cesare’s sojourn in France\r\nis the oft-repeated, totally unproven statement that he withheld from\r\nLouis the dispensation enabling the latter to marry Anne of Brittany,\r\nuntil such time as he should have obtained from Louis all that he\r\ndesired of him--in short, that he sold him the dispensation for the\r\nhighest price he could extract. The only motive served by this statement\r\nis once more to show Alexander and his son in the perpetration of\r\nsimoniacal practices, and the statement springs, beyond doubt, from a\r\npassage in Macchiavelli’s Extracts from Dispatches to the Ten. Elsewhere\r\nhas been mentioned the confusion prevailing in those extracts, and their\r\nunreliability as historical evidences. That circumstance can be now\r\nestablished. The passage in question runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“This dispensation was given to Valentinois when he went to France\r\nwithout any one being aware of its existence, with orders to sell it\r\ndearly to the king, and not until satisfied of the wife and his other\r\ndesires. And, whilst these things were toward, the king learnt from the\r\nBishop of Ceuta that the dispensation already existed, and so, without\r\nhaving received or even seen it the marriage was celebrated, and\r\nfor revealing this the Bishop of Ceuta was put to death by order of\r\nValentinois.”\r\n\r\nNow, to begin with, Macchiavelli admits that what passed between Pope\r\nand duke was secret. How, then, does he pretend to possess these\r\ndetails of it? But, leaving that out of the question, his statement--so\r\nabundantly repeated by later writers--is traversed by every one of the\r\nactual facts of the case.\r\n\r\nThat there can have been no secret at all about the dispensation is made\r\nplain by the fact that Manfredi, the Ferrarese ambassador, writes of it\r\nto Duke Ercole on October 2--the day after Cesare’s departure from Rome.\r\nAnd as for the death of Fernando d’Almeida Bishop of Ceuta, this did not\r\ntake place then, nor until two years later (on January 7, 1499) at the\r\nsiege of Forli, whither he had gone in Cesare’s train--as is related in\r\nBernardi’s Chronicles and Bonoli’s history of that town.\r\n\r\nTo return to the matter of Cesare’s imminent departure unwed from\r\nFrance, Louis XII was not the only monarch to whom this was a source\r\nof anxiety. Keener far was the anxiety experienced on that score by the\r\nKing of Naples, who feared that its immediate consequence would be to\r\ndrive the Holy Father into alliance with Venice, which was paying its\r\ncourt to him at the time and with that end in view. Eager to conciliate\r\nAlexander in this hour of peril, Federigo approached him with\r\nalternative proposals, and offered to invest Cesare in the\r\nprincipalities of Salerno and Sanseverino, which had been taken from the\r\nrebel barons. To this the Pope might have consented, but that, in the\r\nmoment of considering it, letters reached him from Cesare which made him\r\npause.\r\n\r\nLouis XII had also discovered an alternative to the marriage of Cesare\r\nwith Carlotta, and one that should more surely draw the Pope into the\r\nalliance with Venice and himself.\r\n\r\nAmong the ladies of the Court of Queen Anne--Louis had now been wedded\r\na month--there were, besides Carlotta, two other ladies either of whom\r\nmight make Cesare a suitable duchess. One of these was a niece of the\r\nking’s, the daughter of the Comte de Foix; the other was Charlotte\r\nd’Albret, a daughter of Alain d’Albret, Duc de Guyenne, and sister to\r\nthe King of Navarre. Between these two Cesare was now given to choose by\r\nLouis, and his choice fell upon Charlotte.\r\n\r\nShe was seventeen years of age and said to be the most beautiful maid\r\nin France, and she had been reared at the honourable and pious Court of\r\nJeanne de Valois, whence she had passed into that of Anne of Brittany,\r\nwhich latter, says Hilarion de Coste,(1) was “a school of virtue, an\r\nacademy of honour.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Éloges et vies des Reynes, Princesses, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiations for her hand were opened with Alain, who, it is said, was\r\nat first unwilling, but in the end won over to consent. Navarre had need\r\nof the friendship of the King of France, that it might withstand the\r\npredatory humours of Castille; and so, for his son’s sake, Alain could\r\nnot long oppose the wishes of Louis. Considering closely the pecuniary\r\ndifficulties under which this Alain d’Albret was labouring and his\r\nnotorious avarice, one is tempted to conclude that such difficulties\r\nas he may have made were dictated by his reduced circumstances, his\r\nimpossibility, or unwillingness, to supply his daughter with a dowry\r\nfitting her rank, and an unworthy desire to drive in the matter the best\r\nbargain possible. And this is abundantly confirmed by the obvious care\r\nand hard-headed cunning with which the Sieur d’Albret investigated\r\nCesare’s circumstances and sources of revenue to verify their values to\r\nbe what was alleged.\r\n\r\nEventually he consented to endow her with 30,000 livres Tournois (90,000\r\nfrancs) to be paid as follows: 6,000 livres on the celebration of the\r\nmarriage, and the balance by annual instalments of 1,500 livres until\r\ncleared off. This sum, as a matter of fact, represented her portion of\r\nthe inheritance from her deceased mother, Françoise de Bretagne, and it\r\nwas tendered subject to her renouncing all rights and succession in any\r\nproperty of her father’s or her said deceased mother’s.\r\n\r\nThus is it set forth in the contract drawn up by Alain at Castel-Jaloux\r\non March 23, 1499, which contract empowers his son Gabriel and one\r\nRegnault de St. Chamans to treat and conclude the marriage urged by the\r\nking between the Duke of Valentinois and Alain’s daughter, Charlotte\r\nd’Albret. But that was by no means all. Among other conditions imposed\r\nby Alain, he stipulated that the Pope should endow his daughter with\r\n100,000 livres Tournois, and that for his son, Amanieu d’Albret,\r\nthere should be a cardinal’s hat--for the fulfilment of both of which\r\nconditions Cesare took it upon himself to engage his father.\r\n\r\nOn April 15 the treaty between France and Venice was signed at Blois.\r\nIt was a defensive and offensive alliance directed against all, with the\r\nsole exception of the reigning Pontiff, who should have the faculty to\r\nenter into it if he so elected. This was the first decisive step against\r\nthe House of Sforza, and so secretly were the negotiations conducted\r\nthat Lodovico Sforza’s first intimation of them resulted from the\r\ncapture in Milanese territory of a courier from the Pope with letters to\r\nCesare in France. From these he learnt, to his dismay, not only of the\r\nexistence of the league, but that the Pope had joined it. The immediate\r\nconsequence of this positive assurance that Alexander had gone over to\r\nSforza’s enemies was Ascanio Sforza’s hurried departure from Rome on\r\nJuly 13.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Cesare’s marriage had followed almost immediately upon\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty. The nuptials were celebrated on May 12,\r\nand on the 19th he received at the hands of the King of France the\r\nknightly Order of St. Michael, which was then the highest honour\r\nthat France could confer. When the news of this reached the Pope he\r\ncelebrated the event in Rome with public festivities and illuminations.\r\n\r\nOf Cesare’s courtship we have no information. The fact that the marriage\r\nwas purely one of political expediency would tend to make us conceive it\r\nas invested with that sordid lovelessness which must so often attend the\r\nmarriages of princes. But there exists a little data from which we may\r\ndraw certain permissible inferences. This damsel of seventeen was said\r\nto be the loveliest in France, and there is more than a suggestion in\r\nLe Feron’s De Gestis Regnum Gallorum, that Cesare was by no means\r\nindifferent to her charms. He tells us that the Duke of Valentinois\r\nentered into the marriage very heartily, not only for the sake of its\r\nexpediency, but for “the beauty of the lady, which was equalled by her\r\nvirtues and the sweetness of her nature.”\r\n\r\nCesare, we have it on more than one authority, was the handsomest man\r\nof his day. The gallantry of his bearing merited the approval of so\r\nfastidious a critic in such matters as Baldassare Castiglione, who\r\nmentions it in his Il Cortigiano. Of his personal charm there is also no\r\nlack of commendation from those who had his acquaintance at this time.\r\nAdded to this, his Italian splendour and flamboyance may well have\r\ndazzled a maid who had been reared amid the grey and something stern\r\ntones of the Court of Jeanne de Valois.\r\n\r\nAnd so it may well be that they loved, and that they were blessed in\r\ntheir love for the little space allotted them in each other’s company.\r\nThe sequel justifies in a measure the assumption. Just one little summer\r\nout of the span of their lives--brief though those lives were--did they\r\nspend together, and it is good to find some little evidence that, during\r\nthat brief season at least, they inhabited life’s rose-garden.\r\n\r\nIn September--just four short months after the wedding-bells had pealed\r\nabove them--the trumpets of war blared out their call to arms. Louis’s\r\npreparations for the invasion of Milan were complete and he poured his\r\ntroops through Piedmont under the command of Giangiacomo Trivulzio.\r\n\r\nCesare was to accompany Louis into Italy. He appointed his\r\nseventeen-year-old duchess governor and administrator of his lands and\r\nlordships in France and Dauphiny under a deed dated September 8, and\r\nhe made her heiress to all his moveable possessions in the event of his\r\ndeath. Surely this bears some witness, not only to the prevailing of\r\na good understanding between them, but to his esteem of her and the\r\nconfidence he reposed in her mental qualities. The rest her later\r\nmourning of him shows.\r\n\r\nThus did Cesare take leave of the young wife whom he was never to see\r\nagain. Their child--born in the following spring--he was never to see at\r\nall. The pity of it! Ambition-driven, to fulfil the destiny expected of\r\nhim, he turned his back upon that pleasant land of Dauphiny where the\r\none calm little season of his manhood had been spent, where happiness\r\nand peace might have been his lifelong portion had he remained. He set\r\nhis face towards Italy and the storm and stress before him, and in the\r\ntrain of King Louis he set out upon the turbulent meteoric course that\r\nwas to sear so deep and indelible a brand across the scroll of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE KNELL OF THE TYRANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hour of his need Lodovico Sforza found himself without friends\r\nor credit, and he had to pay the price of the sly, faithless egotistical\r\npolicy he had so long pursued with profit.\r\n\r\nHis far-reaching schemes were flung into confusion because a French king\r\nhad knocked his brow against a door, and had been succeeded by one who\r\nconceived that he had a legal right to the throne of Milan, and the\r\nintent and might to enforce it, be the right legal or not. It was in\r\nvain now that Lodovico turned to the powers of Italy for assistance,\r\nin vain that his cunning set fresh intrigues afoot. His neighbours had\r\nfound him out long since; he had played fast and loose with them too\r\noften, and there was none would trust him now.\r\n\r\nThus he found himself isolated, and in no case to withstand the French\r\navalanche which rolled down upon his duchy. The fall of Milan was a\r\nmatter of days; of resistance there was practically none. Town after\r\ntown threw up its gates to the invaders, and Lodovico, seeing himself\r\nabandoned on all sides, sought in flight the safety of his own person.\r\n\r\nCesare took no part in the war, which, after all, was no war--no more\r\nthan an armed progress. He was at Lyons with the King, and he did not\r\nmove into Italy until Louis went to take possession of his new duchy.\r\n\r\nAmid the acclamations of the ever-fickle mob, hailing him as its\r\ndeliverer, Louis XII rode triumphantly into Milan on October 6, attended\r\nby a little host of princes, including the Prince of Savoy, the Dukes\r\nof Montferrat and Ferrara, and the Marquis of Mantua. But the place of\r\nhonour went to Cesare Borgia, who rode at the king’s side, a brilliant\r\nand arresting figure. This was the occasion on which Baldassare\r\nCastiglione--who was in the Marquis of Mantua’s suite--was moved to such\r\npraise of the appearance and gallant bearing of the duke, and of the\r\nsplendid equipment of his suite, which outshone those of all that little\r\nhost of attendant princes.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward Cesare signs himself “Cesare Borgia of France,”\r\n and quarters on his shield the golden lilies of France with the red bull\r\nof the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\nThe conditions on which Alexander VI joined the league of France and\r\nVenice became apparent at about this time. They were to be gathered from\r\nthe embassy of his nephew, the Cardinal Giovanni Borgia, to Venice in\r\nthe middle of September. There the latter announced to the Council of\r\nTen that the Pope’s Holiness aimed at the recovery to the Church of\r\nthose Romagna tyrannies which originally were fiefs of the Holy See\r\nand held by her vicars, who, however, had long since repudiated the\r\nPontifical authority, refused the payment of their tributes, and in some\r\ninstances had even gone so far as to bear arms against the Church.\r\n\r\nWith one or two exceptions the violent and evil misgovernment of these\r\nturbulent princelings was a scandal to all Italy. They ruled by rapine\r\nand murder, and rendered Romagna little better than a nest of brigands.\r\nTheir state of secession from the Holy See arose largely out of the\r\nnepotism practised by the last Popes--a nepotism writers are too prone\r\nto overlook when charging Alexander with the same abuse. Such Popes as\r\nSixtus IV and Innocent VIII had broken up the States of the Church that\r\nthey might endow their children and their nephews. The nepotism of such\r\nas these never had any result but to impoverish the Holy See; whilst, on\r\nthe other hand, the nepotism of Alexander--this Pope who is held up\r\nto obloquy as the archetype of the nepotist--had a tendency rather to\r\nenrich it. It was not to the States of the Church, not by easy ways\r\nof plundering the territories of the Holy See, that he turned to found\r\ndominions and dynasties for his children. He went beyond and outside of\r\nthem, employing princely alliances as the means to his ends. Gandia\r\nwas a duke in Spain; Giuffredo a prince in Naples, and Cesare a duke\r\nin France. For none of these could it be said that territories had\r\nbeen filched from Rome, whilst the alliances made for them were such\r\nas tended to strengthen the power of the Pope, and, therefore, of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe reconsolidation of the States of the Church, the recovery of\r\nher full temporal power, which his predecessors had so grievously\r\ndissipated, had ever been Alexander’s aim; Louis XII afforded him, at\r\nlast, his opportunity, since with French aid the thing now might be\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nHis son Cesare was the Hercules to whom was to be given the labour of\r\ncleaning out the Augean stable of the Romagna.\r\n\r\nThat Alexander may have been single-minded in his purpose has never\r\nbeen supposed. It might, indeed, be to suppose too much; and the general\r\nassumption that, from the outset, his chief aim was to found a powerful\r\nState for his son may be accepted. But let us at least remember that\r\nsuch had been the aims of several Popes before him. Sixtus IV and\r\nInnocent VIII had similarly aimed at founding dynasties in Romagna for\r\ntheir families, but, lacking the talents and political acuteness of\r\nAlexander and a son of the mettle and capacity of Cesare Borgia, the\r\nfeeble trail of their ambition is apt to escape attention. It is also to\r\nbe remembered that, whatever Alexander’s ulterior motive, the immediate\r\nresults of the campaign with which he inspired his son were to reunite\r\nto the Church the States which had fallen away from her, and to\r\nre-establish her temporal sway in the full plenitude of its dominion.\r\nHowever much he may have been imbued with the desire to exalt and\r\naggrandize his children politically, he did nothing that did not at the\r\nsame time make for the greater power and glory of the Church.\r\n\r\nHis formidable Bull published in October set forth how, after trial, it\r\nhad been found that the Lords or Vicars of Rimini, Pesaro, Imola, Forli,\r\nCamerino and Faenza, with other feudatories of the Holy See (including\r\nthe duchy of Urbino) had never paid the yearly tribute due to the\r\nChurch, wherefore he, by virtue of his apostolic authority, deprived\r\nthem of all their rights, and did declare them so deprived.\r\n\r\nIt has been said again and again that this Bull amounting to a\r\ndeclaration of war, was no more than a pretext to indulge his rapacity;\r\nbut surely it bears the impress of a real grievance, and, however\r\nblameable the results that followed out of it, for the measure itself\r\nthere were just and ample grounds.\r\n\r\nThe effect of that Bull, issued at a moment when Cesare stood at arms\r\nwith the might of France at his back, ready to enforce it, was naturally\r\nto throw into a state of wild dismay these Romagna tyrants whose\r\nacquaintance we shall make at closer quarters presently in the course of\r\nfollowing Cesare’s campaign. Cesare Borgia may have been something of a\r\nwolf; but you are not to suppose that the Romagna was a fold of lambs.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Sforza--Cesare’s sometime brother-in­law, and Lord of\r\nPesaro--flies in hot haste to Venice for protection. There are no\r\nlengths to which he will not go to thwart the Borgias in their purpose,\r\nto save his tyranny from falling into the power of this family which he\r\nhates most rabidly, and of which he says that, having robbed him of his\r\nhonour, it would now deprive him of his possessions. He even offers to\r\nmake a gift of his dominions to the Republic.\r\n\r\nThere was much traders’ blood in Venice, and, trader-like, she was avid\r\nof possessions. You can surmise how she must have watered at the mouth\r\nto see so fine a morsel cast thus into her lap, and yet to know that\r\nthe consumption of it might beget a woeful indigestion. Venice shook her\r\nhead regretfully. She could not afford to quarrel with her ally, King\r\nLouis, and so she made answer--a thought contemptuously, it seems--that\r\nGiovanni should have made his offer while he was free to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines exerted themselves to save Forli from the fate that\r\nthreatened it. They urged a league of Bologna, Ferrara, Forli, Piombino,\r\nand Siena for their common safety--a proposal which came to nothing,\r\nprobably because Ferrara and Siena, not being threatened by the Bull,\r\nsaw no reason why, for the sake of others, they should call down upon\r\nthemselves the wrath of the Borgias and their mighty allies.\r\n\r\nVenice desired to save Faenza, whose tyrant, Manfredi, was also\r\nattainted for non-payment of his tributes, and to this end the Republic\r\nsent an embassy to Rome with the moneys due. But the Holy Father refused\r\nthe gold, declaring that it was too late for payment.\r\n\r\nForli’s attempt to avert the danger was of a different sort, and not\r\nexerted until this danger--in the shape of Cesare himself--stood in\r\narms beneath her walls. Two men, both named Tommaso--though it does not\r\ntranspire that they were related--one a chamberlain of the Palace\r\nof Forli, the other a musician, were so devoted to the Countess\r\nSforza-Riario, the grim termagant who ruled the fiefs of her murdered\r\nhusband, Girolamo Riario, as to have undertaken an enterprise from which\r\nthey cannot have hoped to emerge with their lives. It imported no less\r\nthan the murder of the Pope. They were arrested on November 21, and\r\nin the possession of one of them was found a hollow cane containing\r\na letter “so impregnated with poison that even to unfold it would be\r\ndangerous.” This letter was destined for the Holy Father.\r\n\r\nThe story reads like a gross exaggeration emanating from men who, on the\r\nsubject of poisoning, display the credulity of the fifteenth century, so\r\nignorant in these matters and so prone to the fantastic. And our minds\r\nreceive a shock upon learning that, when put to the question,\r\nthese messengers actually made a confession--upon which the story\r\nrests--admitting that they had been sent by the countess to slay the\r\nPope, in the hope that thus Forli might be saved to the Riarii. At first\r\nwe conclude that those wretched men, examined to the accompaniment\r\nof torture, confessed whatever was required of them, as so frequently\r\nhappened in such cases. Such, indeed, is the very explanation advanced\r\nby more than one writer, coupled with the suggestion, in some instances,\r\nthat the whole affair was trumped up by the Pope to serve his own ends.\r\n\r\nThey will believe the wildest and silliest of poisoning stories (such as\r\nthose of Djem and Cardinal Giovanni Borgia) which reveal the Borgias\r\nas the poisoners; but, let another be accused and the Borgias be the\r\nintended victims, and at once they grow rational, and point out to you\r\nthe wildness of the statement, the impossibility of its being true. Yet\r\nit is a singular fact that a thorough investigation of this case of the\r\nCountess Sforza-Riario’s poisoned letter reveals it to be neither wild\r\nnor impossible but simply diabolical. The explanation of the matter\r\nis to be found in Andrea Bernardi’s Chronicles of Forli. He tells us\r\nexactly how the thing was contrived, with a precision of detail which we\r\ncould wish to see emulated by other contemporaries of his who so lightly\r\nthrow out accusations of poisoning. He informs us that a deadly and\r\ninfectious disease was rampant in Forli in that year 1499, and that,\r\nbefore dispatching her letter to the Pope, the Countess caused it to be\r\nplaced upon the body of one who was sick of this infection--thus hoping\r\nto convey it to his Holiness.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Dite litre lei le aveva fate tocare et tenere adose ad uno nostro\r\ninfetado.”--Andrea Bernardi (Cronache di Forli).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander held a thanksgiving service for his escape at Santa Maria\r\ndella Pace, and Cardinal Raffaele Riario fled precipitately from Rome,\r\njustly fearful of being involved in the papal anger that must fall upon\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nBy that time, however, Cesare had already taken the field. The support\r\nof Louis, conqueror of Milan, had been obtained, and in this Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere had once more been helpful to the Borgias.\r\n\r\nHis reconciliation with the Pope, long since deserved by the services he\r\nhad rendered the House of Borgia in forwarding Cesare’s aims, as we\r\nhave seen, was completed now by an alliance which bound the two families\r\ntogether. His nephew, Francesco della Rovere, had married Alexander’s\r\nniece, Angela Borgia.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter from Giuliano to the Pope, dated October 12, 1499, in\r\nwhich he expresses his deep gratitude in the matter of this marriage,\r\nwhich naturally redounded to the advantage of his house, and pledges\r\nhimself to exert all the influence which he commands with Louis XII for\r\nthe purpose of furthering the Duke of Valentinois’ wishes. So well does\r\nhe keep this promise that we see him utterly abandoning his cousins\r\nthe Riarii, who were likely to be crushed under the hoofs of the now\r\ncharging bull, and devoting himself strenuously to equip Cesare for\r\nthat same charge. So far does he go in this matter that he is one of the\r\nsureties--the other being the Cardinal Giovanni Borgia--for the loan\r\nof 45,000 ducats raised by Cesare in Milan towards the cost of his\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThis is the moment in which to pause and consider this man, who, because\r\nhe was a bitter enemy of Alexander’s, and who, because earlier he had\r\ncovered the Pope with obloquy and insult and is to do so again later, is\r\nhailed as a fine, upright, lofty, independent, noble soul.\r\n\r\nNot so fine, upright, or noble but that he can put aside his rancour\r\nwhen he finds that there is more profit in fawning than in snarling; not\r\nso independent but that he can become a sycophant who writes panegyrics\r\nof Cesare and letters breathing devotion to the Pope, once he has\r\nrealized that thus his interests will be better served. This is the\r\nman, remember, who dubbed Alexander a Jew and a Moor; this the man who\r\nagitated at the Courts of France and Spain for Alexander’s deposition\r\nfrom the Pontificate on the score of the simony of his election; this\r\nthe man whose vituperations of the Holy Father are so often quoted,\r\nsince--coming from lips so honest--they must, from the very moment that\r\nhe utters them, be merited. If only the historian would turn the medal\r\nabout a little, and allow us a glimpse of the reverse as well as of the\r\nobverse, what a world of trouble and misconceptions should we not be\r\nspared!\r\n\r\nDella Rovere had discovered vain his work of defamation, vain his\r\nattempts to induce the Kings of France and Spain to summon a General\r\nCouncil and depose the man whose seat he coveted, so he had sought to\r\nmake his peace with the Holy See. The death of Charles VIII, and the\r\nsuccession of a king who had need of the Pope’s friendship and who found\r\na friend in Alexander, rendered it all the more necessary that della\r\nRovere should set himself to reconquer, by every means in his power, the\r\nfavour of Alexander.\r\n\r\nAnd so you see this honourable, upright man sacrificing his very\r\nfamily to gain that personal end. Where now is that stubbornly honest\r\nconscience of his which made him denounce Alexander as no Christian and\r\nno Pope? Stifled by self-interest. It is as well that this should be\r\nunderstood, for this way lies the understanding of many things.\r\n\r\nThe funds for the campaign being found, Cesare received from Louis\r\nthree hundred lances captained by Yves d’Allègre and four thousand\r\nfoot, composed of Swiss and Gascons, led by the Bailie of Dijon. Further\r\ntroops were being assembled for him at Cesena--the one fief of Romagna\r\nthat remained faithful to the Church--by Achille Tiberti and Ercole\r\nBentivogli, and to these were to be added the Pontifical troops that\r\nwould be sent to him; so that Cesare found himself ultimately at the\r\nhead of a considerable army, some ten thousand strong, well-equipped and\r\nsupported by good artillery.\r\n\r\nLouis XII left Milan on November 7--one month after his triumphal\r\nentrance--and set out to return to France, leaving Trivulzio to\r\nrepresent him as ruler of the Milanese. Two days later Cesare’s army\r\ntook the road, and he himself went with his horse by way of Piacenza,\r\nwhilst the foot, under the Bailie of Dijon, having obtained leave of\r\npassage through the territories of Ferrara and Cremona, followed the Po\r\ndown to Argenta.\r\n\r\nThus did Cesare Borgia--personally attended by a caesarian guard,\r\nwearing his livery--set out upon the conquest of the Romagna. Perhaps\r\nat no period of his career is he more remarkable than at this moment. To\r\nall trades men serve apprenticeships, and to none is the apprenticeship\r\nmore gradual and arduous than to the trade of arms. Yet Cesare\r\nBorgia served none. Like Minerva, springing full-grown and armed into\r\nexistence, so Cesare sprang to generalship in the hour that saw him made\r\na soldier. This was the first army in which he had ever marched, yet he\r\nmarched at the head of it. In his twenty-four years of life he had never\r\nso much as witnessed a battle pitched; yet here was he riding to\r\ndirect battles and to wrest victories. Boundless audacity and swiftest\r\nintelligence welded into an amazing whole!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. IMOLA AND FORLI\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween his departure from Milan and his arrival before Imola, where his\r\ncampaign was to be inaugurated, Cesare paid a flying visit to Rome and\r\nhis father, whom he had not seen for a full year. He remained three days\r\nat the Vatican, mostly closeted with the Pope’s Holiness. At the end of\r\nthat time he went north again to rejoin his army, which by now had been\r\nswelled by the forces that had joined it from Cesena, some Pontifical\r\ntroops, and a condotta under Vitellozzo Vitelli.\r\n\r\nThe latter, who was Lord of Castello, had gone to Milan to seek justice\r\nat the hands of Louis XII against the Florentines, who had beheaded his\r\nbrother Paolo--deservedly, for treason in the conduct of the war against\r\nPisa. This Vitellozzo was a valuable and experienced captain. He took\r\nservice with Cesare, spurred by the hope of ultimately finding a way\r\nto avenge himself upon the Florentines, and in Cesare’s train he now\r\nadvanced upon Imola and Forli.\r\n\r\nThe warlike Countess Caterina Sforza-Riario had earlier been granted\r\nby her children full administration of their patrimony during their\r\nminority. To the defence of this she now addressed herself with all the\r\nresolution of her stern nature. Her life had been unfortunate, and of\r\nhorrors she had touched a surfeit. Her father, Galeazzo Sforza, was\r\nmurdered in Milan Cathedral by a little band of patriots; her brother\r\nGiangaleazzo had died, of want or poison, in the Castle of Pavia, the\r\nvictim of her ambitious uncle, Lodovico; her husband, Girolamo Riario,\r\nshe had seen butchered and flung naked from a window of the very castle\r\nwhich she now defended; Giacomo Feo, whom she had secretly married in\r\nsecond nuptials, was done to death in Forli, under her very eyes, by a\r\nparty of insurrectionaries. Him she had terribly avenged. Getting her\r\nmen-at-arms together, she had ridden at their head into the quarter\r\ninhabited by the murderers, and there ordered--as Macchiavelli tells\r\nus--the massacre of every human being that dwelt in it, women and\r\nchildren included, whilst she remained at hand to see it done.\r\nThereafter she took a third husband, in Giovanni di Pierfrancesco\r\nde’Medici, who died in 1498. By him this lusty woman had a son whose\r\nname was to ring through Italy as that of one of the most illustrious\r\ncaptains of his day--Giovanni delle Bande Nere.\r\n\r\nSuch was the woman whom Sanuto has called “great-souled, but a most\r\ncruel virago,” who now shut herself into her castle to defy the Borgia.\r\n\r\nShe had begun by answering the Pope’s Bull of attainder with the\r\nstatement that, far from owing the Holy See the tribute which it\r\nclaimed, the Holy See was actually in her debt, her husband, Count\r\nGirolamo Riario, having been a creditor of the Church for the provisions\r\nmade by him in his office of Captain-General of the Pontifical forces.\r\nThis subterfuge, however, had not weighed with Alexander, whereupon,\r\nhaving also been frustrated in her attempt upon the life of the Pope’s\r\nHoliness, she had proceeded to measures of martial resistance. Her\r\nchildren and her treasures she had dispatched to Florence that they\r\nmight be out of danger, retaining of the former only her son Ottaviano,\r\na young man of some twenty years; but, for all that she kept him near\r\nher, it is plain that she did not account him worthy of being entrusted\r\nwith the defence of his tyranny, for it was she, herself, the daughter\r\nof the bellicose race of Sforza, who set about the organizing of this.\r\n\r\nDisposing of forces that were entirely inadequate to take the field\r\nagainst the invader, she entrenched herself in her fortress of Forli,\r\nprovisioning it to withstand a protracted siege and proceeding to\r\nfortify it by throwing up outworks and causing all the gates but one to\r\nbe built up.\r\n\r\nWhilst herself engaged upon military measures she sent her son Ottaviano\r\nto Imola to exhort the Council to loyalty and the defence of the city.\r\nBut his mission met with no success. Labouring against him was a mighty\r\nfactor which in other future cases was to facilitate Cesare’s subjection\r\nof the Romagna. The Riarii--in common with so many other of the Romagna\r\ntyrants--had so abused their rule, so ground the people with taxation,\r\nso offended them by violence, and provoked such deep and bitter enmity\r\nthat in this hour of their need they found themselves deservedly\r\nabandoned by their subjects. The latter were become eager to try a\r\nchange of rulers, in the hope of finding thus an improved condition of\r\nthings; a worse, they were convinced, would be impossible.\r\n\r\nSo detested were the Riarii and so abhorred the memory they left behind\r\nthem in Imola that for years afterwards the name of Cesare Borgia was\r\nblessed there as that of a minister of divine justice (“tanquam minister\r\ndivina justitiae”) who had lifted from them the harsh yoke by which they\r\nhad been oppressed.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that, before ever Cesare had come in sight of\r\nImola, he was met by several of its gentlemen who came to offer him\r\nthe town, and he received a letter from the pedagogue Flaminio\r\nwith assurances that, if it should be at all possible to them, the\r\ninhabitants would throw open the gates to him on his approach. And\r\nFlaminio proceeded to implore the duke that should he, nevertheless, be\r\nconstrained to have recourse to arms to win admittance, he should not\r\nblame the citizens nor do violence to the city by putting it to pillage,\r\nassuring him that he would never have a more faithful, loving city than\r\nImola once this should be in his power.\r\n\r\nThe duke immediately sent forward Achille Tiberti with a squadron\r\nof horse to demand the surrender of the town. And the captain of the\r\ngarrison of Imola replied that he was ready to capitulate, since that\r\nwas the will of the people. Three days later--on November 27--Cesare\r\nrode in as conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe example of the town, however, was not followed by the citadel. Under\r\nthe command of Dionigio di Naldo the latter held out, and, as the\r\nduke’s army made its entrance into Imola, the castellan signified\r\nhis resentment by turning his cannon upon the town itself, with such\r\nresolute purpose that many houses were set on fire and demolished. This\r\nNaldo was one of the best reputed captains of foot of his day, and he\r\nhad seen much service under the Sforza; but his experience could avail\r\nhim little here.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th Cesare opened the attack, training his guns upon the\r\ncitadel; but it was not until a week later that, having found a weak\r\nspot in the walls on the side commanding the town, he opened a breach\r\nthrough which his men were able to force a passage, and so possess\r\nthemselves of a half-moon. Seeing the enemy practically within his\r\noutworks, and being himself severely wounded in the head, Naldo\r\naccounted it time to parley. He begged a three-days’ armistice, pledging\r\nhimself to surrender at the end of that time should he not receive\r\nreinforcements in the meanwhile; and to this arrangement the duke\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nThe good faith of Naldo has been questioned, and it has been suggested\r\nthat his asking for three days’ grace was no better than a cloak to\r\ncover his treacherous sale of the fortress to the besieger. It seems,\r\nhowever, to be no more than one of those lightly-uttered, irresponsible\r\nutterances with which the chronicles of the time abound, for Naldo had\r\nleft his wife and children at Forli in the hands of the Countess, as\r\nhostages for his good faith, and this renders improbable the unsupported\r\nstory of his baseness.\r\n\r\nOn December 7, no reinforcements having reached him, Naldo made formal\r\nsurrender of the citadel, safe-conduct having been granted to his\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nA week later there arrived at Imola Cesare’s cousin, the Cardinal\r\nGiovanni Borgia, whom the Pope had constituted legate in Bologna and the\r\nRomagna in place of the Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, and whom he had sent\r\nto support Cesare’s operations with ecclesiastical authority. Cardinal\r\nGiovanni, as the Pope’s representative, received in the Church of\r\nSan Domenico the oath of fealty of the city to the Holy See. This was\r\npledged by four representative members of the Council of Thirty; and\r\nby that act the conquest and subjection of the town became a fully\r\naccomplished fact.\r\n\r\nThe lesser strongholds of the territory threw up their gates one by\r\none before the advancing enemy, until only Forli remained to be taken.\r\nCesare pushed forward to reduce it.\r\n\r\nOn his way he passed through Faenza, whose tyrant, Manfredi, deeming\r\nhimself secure in the protection of Venice and in view of the\r\ncircumstance that the republic had sent to Rome the arrears of tribute\r\ndue from his fief, and anxious to conciliate the Pope, received and\r\nentertained Cesare very cordially.\r\n\r\nAt Forli the case of Imola was practically repeated. Notwithstanding\r\nthat the inhabitants were under the immediate eye of the formidable\r\ncountess, and although she sent her brother, Alessandro Sforza, to\r\nexhort the people and the Council to stand by her, the latter, weary\r\nas the rest of the oppressive tyranny of her family, dispatched their\r\nrepresentatives to Cesare to offer him the town.\r\n\r\nThe Countess’s valour was of the sort that waxes as the straits become\r\nmore desperate. Since the town abandoned and betrayed her, she would\r\ndepend upon her citadel, and by a stubborn resistance make Cesare pay as\r\ndearly as possible for the place. To the danger which she seems almost\r\neager to incur for her own part, this strong-minded, comely matron will\r\nnot subject the son she has kept beside her until now; and so she packs\r\nOttaviano off to Florence and safety. That done, she gives her mutinous\r\nsubjects a taste of her anger by attempting to seize half a dozen of the\r\nprincipal citizens of Forli. As it happened, not only did this intent\r\nmiscarry, but it went near being the means of involving her in battle\r\neven before the duke’s arrival; for the people, getting wind of the\r\naffair, took up arms to defend their threatened fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nShe consoled herself, however, by seizing the persons of Nicolo\r\nTornielli and Lodovico Ercolani, whom the Council had sent to inform\r\nher that their representatives had gone to Cesare with the offer of the\r\ntown. Further, to vent her rage and signify her humour, she turned her\r\ncannon upon the Communal Palace and shattered the tower of it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cesare advanced. It was again Tiberti who now rode forward\r\nwith his horse to demand the surrender of Forli. This was accorded as\r\nreadily as had been that of Imola, whereupon Cesare came up to take\r\npossession in person; but, despite the cordial invitation of the\r\ncouncillors, he refused to enter the gates until he had signed the\r\narticles of capitulation.\r\n\r\nOn December 19, under a deluge of rain, Cesare, in full armour, the\r\nbanner of the Church borne ahead of him, rode into Forli with his\r\ntroops. He was housed in the palace of Count Luffo Nomaglie (one of\r\nthe gentlemen whom Caterina had hoped to capture), and his men were\r\nquartered through the town. These foreign soldiers of his seem to have\r\ngot a little out of hand here at Forli, and they committed a good many\r\nabuses, to the dismay and discomfort of the Citizens.\r\n\r\nSanuto comments upon this with satisfaction, accounting the city well\r\nserved for having yielded herself up like a strumpet. It is a comment\r\nmore picturesque than just, for obviously Forli did not surrender\r\nthrough pusillanimity, but to the end that it might be delivered from\r\nthe detestable rule of the Riarii.\r\n\r\nThe city occupied, it now remained to reduce the fortress and bring its\r\nwarrior-mistress to terms. Cesare set about this at once, nor allowed\r\nthe Christmas festivities to interfere with his labours, but kept his\r\nmen at work to bring the siege-guns into position. On Christmas Day the\r\ncountess belatedly attempted a feeble ruse in the hope of intimidating\r\nthem. She flew from her battlements a banner, bearing the device of the\r\nlion of St. Mark, thinking to trick Cesare into the belief that she had\r\nobtained the protection of Venice, or, perhaps, signifying thus that\r\nshe threw herself into the arms of the republic, making surrender of her\r\nfiefs to the Venetians to the end that she might spite a force which she\r\ncould not long withstand--as Giovanni Sforza had sought to do.\r\n\r\nBut Cesare, nowise disturbed by that banner, pursued his preparations,\r\nwhich included the mounting of seven cannons and ten falconets in the\r\nsquare before the Church of St. John the Baptist. When all was ready\r\nfor the bombardment, he made an effort to cause her to realize the\r\nhopelessness of her resistance and the vain sacrifice of life it must\r\nentail. He may have been moved to this by the valour she displayed, or\r\nit may have been that he obeyed the instincts of generalship which made\r\nhim ever miserly in the matter of the lives of his soldiers. Be that as\r\nit may, with intent to bring her to a reasonable view of the situation,\r\nhe rode twice to the very edge of the ditch to parley with her; but\r\nall that came of his endeavours was that on the occasion of his second\r\nappeal to her, he had a narrow escape of falling a victim to her\r\ntreachery, and so losing his life.\r\n\r\nShe came down from the ramparts, and, ordering the lowering of the\r\nbridge, invited him to meet her upon it that there they might confer\r\nmore at their ease, having, meanwhile, instructed her castellan to\r\nraise the bridge again the moment the duke should set foot upon it. The\r\ncastellan took her instructions too literally, for even as the duke did\r\nset one foot upon it there was a grind and clank of machinery, and the\r\ngreat structure swung up and clattered into place. The duke remained\r\noutside, saved by a too great eagerness on the part of those who worked\r\nthe winches, for had they waited but a second longer they must have\r\ntrapped him.\r\n\r\nCesare returned angry to Forli, and set a price upon Caterina’s\r\nhead--20,000 ducats if taken alive, 10,000 if dead; and on the morrow he\r\nopened fire. For a fortnight this was continued without visible result,\r\nand daily the countess was to be seen upon the walls with her castellan,\r\ndirecting the defences. But on January 12, Cesare’s cannon having been\r\nconcentrated upon one point, a breach was opened at last. Instantly the\r\nwaiting citizens, who had been recruited for the purpose, made forward\r\nwith their faggots, heaping them up in the moat until a passage was\r\npracticable. Over this went Cesare’s soldiers to force an entrance.\r\n\r\nA stubborn fight ensued within the ravelin, where the duke’s men were\r\nheld in check by the defenders, and not until some four hundred corpses\r\nchoked that narrow space did the besieged give ground before them.\r\n\r\nLike most of the Italian fortresses of the period, the castle of Forli\r\nconsisted of a citadel within a citadel. In the heart of the main\r\nfabric--but cut off from it again by its own moat--arose the great tower\r\nknown as the Maschio. This was ever the last retreat of the besieged\r\nwhen the fortress itself had been carried by assault, and, in the case\r\nof the Maschio of the Citadel of Forli, so stout was its construction\r\nthat it was held to be practically invulnerable.\r\n\r\nHad the countess’s soldiers made their retreat in good order to this\r\ntower, where all the munitions and provisions were stored, Cesare would\r\nhave found the siege but in the beginning; but in the confusion of that\r\ngrim hour, besieged and besiegers, Borgian and Riarian, swept forward\r\ninterlocked, a writhing, hacking, bleeding mob of men-at-arms. Thus\r\nthey flung themselves in a body across the bridge that spanned the inner\r\nmoat, and so into the Maschio, whilst the stream of Cesare’s soldiers\r\nthat poured uninterruptedly across in the immediate wake of that\r\nbattling mass rendered it impossible for the defenders to take up the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nWithin the tower the carnage went on, and the duke’s men hacked\r\ntheir way through what remained of the Forlivese until they had made\r\nthemselves masters of that inner stronghold whither Caterina had sought\r\nher last refuge.\r\n\r\nA Burgundian serving under the Bailie of Dijon was the first to come\r\nupon her in the room to which she had fled with a few attendants and a\r\nhandful of men, amongst whom were Alessandro Sforza, Paolo Riario, and\r\nScipione Riario--this last an illegitimate son of her first husband’s,\r\nwhom she had adopted. The Burgundian declared her his prisoner, and held\r\nher for the price that had been set upon her head until the arrival of\r\nCesare, who entered the citadel with his officers a little while after\r\nthe final assault had been delivered.\r\n\r\nCesare received and treated her with the greatest courtesy, and, seeing\r\nher for the moment destitute, he presented her with a purse containing\r\ntwo hundred ducats for her immediate needs. Under his escort she left\r\nthe castle, and was conducted, with her few remaining servants, to the\r\nNomaglie Palace to remain in the Duke’s care, his prisoner. Her brother\r\nand the other members of her family found with her were similarly made\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter her departure the citadel was given over to pillage, and all\r\nhell must have raged in it if we may judge from an incident related\r\nby Bernardi in his chronicles. A young clerk, named Evangelista da\r\nMonsignane, being seized by a Burgundian soldier who asked him if he had\r\nany money, produced and surrendered a purse containing thirteen ducats,\r\nand so got out of the mercenaries’ clutches, but only to fall into the\r\nhands of others, one of whom again declared him a prisoner. The poor\r\nyouth, terrified at the violence about him, and eager to be gone from\r\nthat shambles, cried out that, if they would let him go, he would pay\r\nthem a ransom of a hundred ducats.\r\n\r\nThereupon “Surrender to me!” cried one of the soldiers, and, as the\r\nclerk was about to do so, another, equally greedy for the ransom, thrust\r\nhimself forward. “No. Surrender to me, rather,” demanded this one.\r\n\r\nThe first insisted that the youth was his prisoner, whereupon the second\r\nbrandished his sword, threatening to kill Evangelista. The clerk, in a\r\npanic, flung himself into the arms of a monk who was with him, crying\r\nout for mercy, and there in the monk’s arms he was brutally slain, “to\r\nput an end,” said his murderer, “to the dispute.”\r\n\r\nForlimpopoli surrendered a few days later to Yves d’Allègre, whom\r\nCesare had sent thither, whilst in Forli, as soon as he had reduced the\r\ncitadel, and before even attempting to repair the damage done, the\r\nduke set about establishing order and providing for the dispensation of\r\njustice, exerting to that end the rare administrative ability which not\r\neven his bitterest detractors have denied him.\r\n\r\nHe sent a castellan to Forlimpopoli and fetched from Imola a Podestà for\r\nForli.(1) He confirmed the Council of Forty that ruled Forli--being\r\nten for each quarter of the city--and generally made sound and wise\r\nprovision for the town’s well-being, which we shall presently see\r\nbearing fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  It was customary throughout Italy that the Podestà, or chief\r\nmagistrate, should never be a native of the town--rarely of the\r\nState--in which he held his office. Thus, having no local interests or\r\nrelationships, he was the likelier to dispense justice with desirable\r\nsingle-mindedness.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext the repairing of the fortress claimed his attention, and he\r\ndisposed for this, entrusting the execution of his instructions to\r\nRamiro de Lorqua, whom he left behind as governor. In the place where\r\nthe breach was opened by his cannon he ordered the placing of a marble\r\npanel bearing his arms; and there it is to be seen to this day: Dexter,\r\nthe sable bars of the House of Lenzol; Sinister, the Borgia bull in\r\nchief, and the lilies of France; and, superimposed, an inescutcheon\r\nbearing the Pontifical arms.\r\n\r\nAll measures being taken so far as Forli was concerned, Cesare turned\r\nhis attention to Pesaro, and prepared to invade it. Before leaving,\r\nhowever, he awaited the return of his absent cousin, the Cardinal\r\nGiovanni Borgia, who, as papal legate, was to receive the oath of fealty\r\nof the town; but, instead of the cardinal whom he was expecting, came a\r\nmessenger with news of his death of fever at Fossombrone.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Borgia had left Forli on December 28 to go to Cesena, with\r\nintent, it was said, to recruit to his cousin’s army those men of\r\nRimini, who, exiled and in rebellion against their tyrant Malatesta,\r\nhad sought shelter in that Pontifical fief. Thence he had moved on\r\nto Urbino, where--in the ducal palace--he awaited news of the fall of\r\nForli, and where, whilst waiting, he fell ill. Nevertheless, when the\r\ntidings of Cesare’s victory reached him, he insisted upon getting to\r\nhorse, to repair to Forli; but, discovering himself too ill to keep the\r\nsaddle, he was forced to abandon the journey at Fossombrone, whilst the\r\noutcome of the attempt was an aggravation of the fever resulting in the\r\ncardinal’s death.\r\n\r\nCesare appears to have been deeply grieved by the loss of Giovanni,\r\nand there is every cause to suppose that a sincere attachment prevailed\r\nbetween the cousins. Yet Cesare has been charged with his death, and\r\naccused of having poisoned him, and, amidst the host of silly, baseless\r\naccusations levelled against Cesare, you shall find none more silly or\r\nbaseless than this. In other instances of unproven crimes with which he\r\nhas been charged there may be some vestiges of matter that may do duty\r\nfor evidence or be construed into motives; here there is none that\r\nwill serve one purpose or the other, and the appalling and rabid\r\nunscrupulousness, the relentless malice of Borgian chroniclers is in\r\nnothing so completely apparent as in this accusation.\r\n\r\nSanuto mentions the advices received, and the rumours which say that\r\nCesare murdered him through jealousy, knowing him beloved by the Pope,\r\nseeing him a legate, and fearing that he might come to be given the\r\ngovernorship of some Romagna fief.\r\n\r\nWhen Gandia died and Cesare was accused of having murdered him, the\r\nmotive advanced was that Cesare, a papal legate, resented a brother who\r\nwas a duke. Now, Cesare, being a duke, resents a cousin’s being a papal\r\nlegate. You will observe that, if this method of discovering motives is\r\npursued a little further, there is no man who died in Cesare’s life-time\r\nwhom Cesare could not be shown to have had motives for murdering.\r\n\r\nSillier even than Sanuto’s is the motive with which Giovio attempts to\r\nbolster up the accusation which he reports: “He [Cesare] poisoned him\r\nbecause he [Giovanni] favoured the Duke of Gandia.”\r\n\r\nThat, apparently, was the best that Giovio could think of. It is hardly\r\nintelligible--which is perhaps inevitable, for it is not easy to be\r\nintelligible when you don’t quite know, yourself, what you mean, which\r\nmust have been Giovio’s case.\r\n\r\nThe whole charge is so utterly foolish, stupid, and malicious that it\r\nwould scarcely be worth mentioning, were it not that so many modern\r\nwriters have included this among the Borgia crimes. As a matter of\r\nfact--and as a comparison of the above-cited dates will show--eighteen\r\ndays had elapsed between Giovanni Borgia’s leaving Cesare at Forli and\r\nhis succumbing at Urbino--which in itself disposes of the matter. It\r\nmay be mentioned that this is a circumstance which those foolish or\r\ndeliberately malicious calumniators either did not trouble to ascertain\r\nor else thought it wiser to slur over. Although, had they been pressed,\r\nthere was always the death of Djem to be cited and the fiction of the\r\nslow-working poison specially invented to meet and explain his case.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the invasion of Pesaro were complete, and it was\r\ndetermined that on January 22 the army should march out of Forli; but on\r\nthe night of the 21st a disturbance occurred. The Swiss under the\r\nBailie of Dijon became mutinous--they appear throughout to have been an\r\nill-conditioned lot--and they clamoured now for higher pay if they were\r\nto go on to Pesaro, urging that already they had served the Duke of\r\nValentinois as far as they had pledged themselves to the King of France.\r\n\r\nTowards the third hour of the night the Bailie himself, with these\r\nmutineers at his heels, presented himself at the Nomaglie Palace to\r\ndemand that the Countess Sforza-Riario should be delivered into his\r\nhands. His claim was that she was his prisoner, since she had been\r\narrested by a soldier of his own, and that her surrender was to France,\r\nto which he added--a thought inconsequently, it seems--that the French\r\nlaw forbade that women should be made prisoners. Valentinois, taken\r\nutterly by surprise, and without the force at hand to resist the Bailie\r\nand his Swiss, was compelled to submit and to allow the latter to carry\r\nthe countess off to his own lodging; but he dispatched a messenger to\r\nForlimpopoli with orders for the immediate return of Allègre and his\r\nhorse, and in the morning, after Mass, he had the army drawn up in the\r\nmarket-place; and so, backed by his Spanish, French, and Italian troops,\r\nhe faced the threatening Swiss.\r\n\r\nThe citizens were in a panic, expecting to see battle blaze out at any\r\nmoment, and apprehensive of the consequences that might ensue for the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss had grown more mutinous than ever overnight, and they now\r\nrefused to march until they were paid. It was Cesare’s to quell and\r\nrestore them to obedience. He informed them that they should be paid\r\nwhen they reached Cesena, and that, if they were retained thereafter\r\nin his employ, their pay should be on the improved scale which they\r\ndemanded. Beyond that he made no concessions. The remainder of his\r\nharangue was matter to cow them into submission, for he threatened to\r\norder the ringing of the alarm-bells, and to have them cut to pieces by\r\nthe people of Forli whom their gross and predatory habits had already\r\ndeeply offended.\r\n\r\nOrder was at last restored, and the Bailie of Dijon was compelled to\r\nsurrender back the countess to Cesare. But their departure was postponed\r\nuntil the morrow. On that day, January 23, after receiving the oath\r\nof fealty from the Anziani in the Church of San Mercuriale, the duke\r\nmarched his army out of Forli and took the road to Pesaro.\r\n\r\nCaterina Sforza Riario went with him. Dressed in black and mounted upon\r\na white horse, the handsome amazon rode between Cesare Borgia and Yves\r\nd’Allègre.\r\n\r\nAt Cesena the duke made a halt, and there he left the countess in the\r\ncharge of d’Allègre whilst he himself rode forward to overtake the main\r\nbody of his army, which was already as far south as Cattolica. As for\r\nGiovanni Sforza, despite the fact that the Duke of Urbino had sent some\r\nfoot to support him, he was far more likely to run than to fight, and\r\nin fact he had already taken the precaution of placing his money and\r\nvaluables in safety and was disposing, himself, to follow them. But\r\nit happened that there was not yet the need. Fate--in the shape of his\r\ncousin Lodovico of Milan--postponed the occasion.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th Cesare lay at Montefiori, and there he was reached by\r\ncouriers sent at all speed from Milan by Trivulzio. Lodovico Sforza\r\nhad raised an army of Swiss and German mercenaries to reconquer his\r\ndominions, and the Milanese were opening their arms to receive him back,\r\nhaving already discovered that, in exchanging his rule for that of the\r\nFrench, they had but exchanged King Log for King Stork. Trivulzio begged\r\nfor the instant return of the French troops serving under Cesare,\r\nand Cesare, naturally compelled to accede, was forced to postpone the\r\ncontinuance of his campaign, a matter which must have been not a little\r\nvexatious at such a moment.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Cesena, where, on the 27th, he dismissed Yves d’Allègre\r\nand his men, who made all haste back to Milan, so that Cesare was left\r\nwith a force of not more than a thousand foot and five hundred horse.\r\nThese, no doubt, would have sufficed him for the conquest of Pesaro, but\r\nGiovanni Sforza, encouraged by his cousin’s return, and hopeful now of\r\nassistance, would certainly entrench himself and submit to a siege which\r\nmust of necessity be long-drawn, since the departure of the French had\r\ndeprived Cesare of his artillery.\r\n\r\nTherefore the duke disposed matters for his return to Rome instead,\r\nand, leaving Ercole Bentivogli with five hundred horse and Gonsalvo de\r\nMirafuente with three hundred foot to garrison Forli, he left Cesena\r\nwith the remainder of his forces, including Vitelli’s horse, on January\r\n30. With him went Caterina Sforza-Riario, and of course there were not\r\nwanting those who alleged that, during the few days at Cesena he\r\nhad carried his conquest of her further than the matter of her\r\nterritories(1)--a rumour whose parent was, no doubt, the ribald jest\r\nmade in Milan by Trivulzio when he heard of her capture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Teneva detta Madona (la qual é belissima dona, fiola del Ducha\r\nGaleazo di Milan) di zorno e di note in la sna camera, con la\r\nquale--judicio omnium--si deva piacer” (Sanuto’s Diarii).\r\n\r\n\r\nHe conducted her to Rome--in golden chains, “like another Palmyra,” it\r\nis said--and there she was given the beautiful Belvedere for her prison\r\nuntil she attempted an escape in the following June; whereupon, for\r\ngreater safety, she was transferred to the Castle of Sant’ Angelo. There\r\nshe remained until May of 1501, when, by the intervention of the King of\r\nFrance, she was set at liberty and permitted to withdraw to Florence\r\nto rejoin her children. In the city of the lilies she abode, devoting\r\nherself to good works until she ended her turbulent, unhappy life in\r\n1509.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that she was not made to pay with her life for her\r\nattempt to poison the Pope is surely something in favour of the Borgias,\r\nand it goes some way towards refuting the endless statements of their\r\nfierce and vindictive cruelty. Of course, it has been urged that they\r\nspared her from fear of France; but, if that is admitted, what then\r\nbecomes of the theory of that secret poison which might so well have\r\nbeen employed in such a case as this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. GONFALONIER OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Cesare Borgia’s conquest of Imola and Forli cannot seriously be\r\naccounted extraordinary military achievements--save by consideration of\r\nthe act that this was the first campaign he had conducted--yet in Rome\r\nthe excitement caused by his victory was enormous. Possibly this is to\r\nbe assigned to the compelling quality of the man’s personality, which\r\nwas beginning to manifest and assert itself and to issue from the shadow\r\ninto which it had been cast hitherto by that of his stupendous father.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm mounted higher and higher whilst preparations were being\r\nmade for his reception, and reached its climax on February 26, when,\r\nwith overpowering pomp, he made an entrance into Rome that was a\r\nveritable triumph.\r\n\r\nSanuto tells us that, as news came of his approach, the Pope, in\r\nhis joyous impatience and excitement, became unable to discharge the\r\nbusiness of his office, and no longer would give audience to any one.\r\nAlexander had ever shown himself the fondest of fathers to his children,\r\nand now he overflowed with pride in this son who already gave such\r\nexcellent signs of his capacity as a condottiero, and justified his\r\nhaving put off the cassock to strap a soldier’s harness to his lithe and\r\ncomely body.\r\n\r\nCardinals Farnese and Borgia, with an imposing suite, rode out some way\r\nbeyond the gates of Santa Maria del Popolo to meet the duke. At the gate\r\nitself a magnificent reception had been prepared him, and the entire\r\nPontifical Court, prelates, priests, ambassadors of the Powers, and\r\nofficials of the city and curia down to the apostolic abbreviators and\r\nsecretaries, waited to receive him.\r\n\r\nIt was towards evening--between the twenty-second and the twenty-third\r\nhours--when he made his entrance. In the van went the baggage-carts, and\r\nbehind these marched a thousand foot in full campaign apparel, headed\r\nby two heralds in the duke’s livery and one in the livery of the King\r\nof France. Next came Vitellozzo’s horse followed by fifty mounted\r\ngentlemen-at-arms--the duke’s Caesarean guard--immediately preceding\r\nCesare himself.\r\n\r\nThe handsome young duke--“bello e biondo”--was splendidly mounted, but\r\nvery plainly dressed in black velvet with a simple gold chain for only\r\nornament, and he had about him a hundred guards on foot, also in black\r\nvelvet, halbert on shoulder, and a posse of trumpeters in a livery\r\nthat displayed his arms. In immediate attendance upon him came several\r\ncardinals on their mules, and behind these followed the ambassadors of\r\nthe Powers, Cesare’s brother Giuffredo Borgia, and Alfonso of Aragon,\r\nDuke of Biselli and Prince of Salerno--Lucrezia’s husband and the father\r\nof her boy Roderigo, born some three months earlier. Conspicuous,\r\ntoo, in Cesare’s train would be the imposing figure of the formidable\r\nCountess Sforza-Riario, in black upon her white horse, riding in her\r\ngolden shackles between her two attendant women.\r\n\r\nAs the procession reached the Bridge of Sant’ Angelo a salute was\r\nthundered forth by the guns from the castle, where floated the banners\r\nof Cesare and of the Church. The press of people from the Porta del\r\nPopolo all the way to the Vatican was enormous. It was the year of\r\nthe Papal Jubilee, and the city was thronged, with pilgrims from\r\nall quarters of Europe who had flocked to Rome to obtain the plenary\r\nindulgence offered by the Pope. So great was the concourse on this\r\noccasion that the procession had the greatest difficulty in moving\r\nforward, and the progress through the streets, packed with shouting\r\nmultitudes, was of necessity slow. At last, however, the Bridge of Sant’\r\nAngelo being crossed, the procession pushed on to the Vatican along\r\nthe new road inaugurated for the Jubilee by Alexander in the previous\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nFrom the loggia above the portals of the Vatican the Pope watched his\r\nson’s imposing approach, and when the latter dismounted at the steps his\r\nHoliness, with his five attendant cardinals, descended to the Chamber\r\nof the Papagallo--the papal audience­chamber, contiguous to the Borgia\r\napartments--to receive the duke. Thither sped Cesare with his multitude\r\nof attendants, and at sight of him now the Pope’s eyes were filled with\r\ntears of joy. The duke advanced gravely to the foot of the throne, where\r\nhe fell upon his knees, and was overheard by Burchard to express to\r\nhis father, in their native Spanish, all that he owed to the Pope’s\r\nHoliness, to which Alexander replied in the same tongue. Then Cesare\r\nstooped and kissed the Pope’s feet and then his hand, whereupon\r\nAlexander, conquered no doubt by the paternal instincts of affection\r\nthat were so strong in him, raised his son and took him fondly in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe festivities in honour of Cesare’s return were renewed in Rome upon\r\nthe morrow, and to this the circumstance that the season was that of\r\ncarnival undoubtedly contributed and lent the displays a threatrical\r\ncharacter which might otherwise have been absent. In these the duke’s\r\nvictories were made the subject of illustration. There was a procession\r\nof great chariots in Piazza Navona, with groups symbolizing the triumphs\r\nof the ancient Caesar, in the arrangement of which, no doubt, the\r\nassistance had been enlisted of that posse of valiant artists who were\r\nthen flocking to Rome and the pontifical Court.\r\n\r\nYriarte, mixing his facts throughout with a liberal leaven of fiction,\r\ntells us that “this is the precise moment in which Cesare Borgia, fixing\r\nhis eyes upon the Roman Caesar, takes him definitely for his model and\r\nadopts the device ‘Aut Caesar, aut nihil.’”\r\n\r\nCesare Borgia never adopted that device, and never displayed it. In\r\nconnection with him it is only to be found upon the sword of honour\r\nmade for him when, while still a cardinal, he went to crown the King\r\nof Naples. It is not at all unlikely that the inscription of the device\r\nupon that sword--which throughout is engraved with illustrations of the\r\ncareer of Julius Caesar--may have been the conceit of the sword-maker\r\nas a rather obvious play upon Cesare’s name.(1) Undoubtedly, were the\r\ndevice of Cesare’s own adoption we should find it elsewhere, and nowhere\r\nelse is it to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The scabbard of this sword is to be seen in the South Kensington\r\nMuseum; the sword itself is in the possession of the Caetani family.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after Cesare’s return to Rome, Imola and Forli sent their\r\nambassadors to the Vatican to beseech his Holiness to sign the articles\r\nwhich those cities had drawn up and by virtue of which they created\r\nCesare their lord in the place of the deposed Riarii.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that Alexander had announced that, in promoting the\r\nRomagna campaign, he had for object to restore to the Church the States\r\nwhich had rebelliously seceded from her. Yet there is not sufficient\r\nreason to suppose that he was flagrantly breaking his word in acceding\r\nto the request of which those ambassadors were the bearers and in\r\ncreating his son Count of Imola and Forli. Admitted that this was to\r\nCesare’s benefit and advancement, it is still to be remembered that\r\nthose fiefs must be governed for the Church by a Vicar, as had ever been\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThat being so, who could have been preferred to Cesare for the dignity,\r\nseeing that not only was the expulsion of the tyrants his work, but that\r\nthe inhabitants themselves desired him for their lord? For the rest,\r\ngranted his exceptional qualifications, it is to be remembered that the\r\nPope was his father, and--setting aside the guilt and scandal of that\r\npaternity--it is hardly reasonable to expect a father to prefer some\r\nother to his son for a stewardship for which none is so well equipped\r\nas that same son. That Imola and Forli were not free gifts to Cesare,\r\ndetached, for the purpose of so making them, from the Holy See, is clear\r\nfrom the title of Vicar with which Cesare assumed control of them, as\r\nset forth in the Bull of investiture.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his receiving the rank of Vicar and Count of Imola and\r\nForli, it was in this same month of March at last--and after Cesare may\r\nbe said to have earned it--that he received the Gonfalon of the\r\nChurch. With the unanimous concurrence of the Sacred College, the Pope\r\nofficially appointed him Captain-General of the Pontifical forces--the\r\ncoveting of which position was urged, it will be remembered, as one of\r\nhis motives for his alleged murder of the Duke of Gandia three years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nOn March 29 Cesare comes to St. Peter’s to receive his new dignity and\r\nthe further honour of the Golden Rose which the Pope is to bestow upon\r\nhim--the symbol of the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant.\r\n\r\nHaving blessed the Rose, the Pope is borne solemnly into St. Peter’s,\r\npreceded by the College of Cardinals. Arrived before the High Altar,\r\nhe puts off his tiara--the conical, richly jewelled cap, woven from the\r\nplumage of white peacocks--and bareheaded kneels to pray; whereafter he\r\nconfesses himself to the Cardinal of Benevento, who was the celebrant\r\non this occasion. That done, he ascends and takes his seat upon the\r\nPontifical Throne, whither come the cardinals to adore him, while the\r\norgan peals forth and the choir gives voice. Last of all comes Cesare,\r\ndressed in cloth of gold with ermine border, to kneel upon the\r\ntopmost step of the throne, whereupon the Pope, removing his tiara and\r\ndelivering it to the attendant Cardinal of San Clemente, pronounces the\r\nbeautiful prayer of the investiture. That ended, the Pope receives\r\nfrom the hands of the Cardinal of San Clemente the splendid mantle of\r\ngonfalonier, and sets it about the duke’s shoulders with the prescribed\r\nwords: “May the Lord array thee in the garment of salvation and surround\r\nthee with the cloak of happiness.” Next he takes from the hands of the\r\nMaster of the Ceremonies--that same Burchard whose diary supplies us\r\nwith these details--the gonfalonier’s cap of scarlet and ermine richly\r\ndecked with pearls and surmounted by a dove--the emblem of the Holy\r\nSpirit--likewise wrought in pearls. This he places upon Cesare’s\r\nauburn head; whereafter, once more putting off his tiara, he utters the\r\nprescribed prayer over the kneeling duke.\r\n\r\nThat done, and the Holy Father resuming his seat and his tiara, Cesare\r\nstoops to kiss the Pope’s feet, then rising, goes in his gonfalonier\r\napparel, the cap upon his head, to take his place among the cardinals.\r\nThe organ crashes forth again; the choir intones the “Introito ad altare\r\nDeum”; the celebrant ascends the altar, and, having offered incense,\r\ndescends again and the Mass begins.\r\n\r\nThe Mass being over, and the celebrant having doffed his sacred\r\nvestments and rejoined his brother cardinals, the Cardinal of San\r\nClemente repairs once more to the Papal Throne, preceded by two\r\nchamberlains who carry two folded banners, one bearing the Pope’s\r\npersonal arms, the other the arms of Holy Church. Behind the cardinal\r\nfollows an acolyte with the censer and incense-boat and another with the\r\nholy water and the aspersorio, and behind these again two prelates with\r\na Missal and a candle. The Pope rises, blesses the folded banners and\r\nincenses them, having received the censer from the hands of a priest who\r\nhas prepared it. Then, as he resumes his seat, Cesare steps forward once\r\nmore, and, kneeling, places both hands upon the Missal and pronounces in\r\na loud, clear voice the words of the oath of fealty to St. Peter and the\r\nPope, swearing ever to protect the latter and his successors from harm\r\nto life, limb, or possessions. Thereafter the Pope takes the blessed\r\nbanners and gives the charge of them to Cesare, delivering into his\r\nhands the white truncheon symbolic of his office, whilst the Master of\r\nCeremonies hands the actual banners to the two deputies, who in full\r\narmour have followed to receive them, and who attach them to the lances\r\nprovided for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe investiture is followed by the bestowal of the Golden Rose,\r\nwhereafter Cesare, having again kissed the Pope’s feet and the Ring of\r\nthe Fisherman on his finger, has the cap of office replaced upon his\r\nhead by Burchard himself, and so the ceremonial ends.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Isernia was going to Cesena to assume the governorship of\r\nthat Pontifical fief, and, profiting by this, Cesare appointed him\r\nhis lieutenant-general in Romagna, with authority over all his other\r\nofficers there and full judicial powers. Further, he desired him to act\r\nas his deputy and receive the oath of fealty of the duke’s new subjects.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cesare abode in Rome, no doubt impatient of the interruption\r\nwhich his campaign had suffered, and which it seemed must continue yet\r\nawhile. Lodovico Sforza had succeeded in driving the French out of his\r\ndominions as easily as he, himself, had been driven out by them a\r\nfew months earlier. But Louis XII sent down a fresh army under La\r\nTrémouille, and Lodovico, basely betrayed by his Swiss mercenaries at\r\nNovara in April, was taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nThat was the definite end of the Sforza rule in Milan. For ten years the\r\ncrafty, scheming Lodovico was left to languish a prisoner in the Castle\r\nof Loches, at the end of which time he miserably died.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the return of the French to Milan, the Pope asked for\r\ntroops that Cesare might resume his enterprise not only against Pesaro,\r\nFaenza, and Rimini, but also against Bologna, where Giovanni Bentivogli\r\nhad failed to support--as in duty bound--the King of France against\r\nLodovico Sforza. But Bentivogli repurchased the forfeited French\r\nprotection at the price of 40,000 ducats, and so escaped the impending\r\ndanger; whilst Venice, it happened, was growing concerned to see no\r\nprofit accruing to herself out of this league with France and Rome; and\r\nthat was a matter which her trader spirit could not brook. Therefore,\r\nVenice intervened in the matter of Rimini and Faenza, which she\r\nprotected in somewhat the same spirit as the dog protected the straw in\r\nthe manger. Next, when, having conquered the Milanese, Louis XII turned\r\nhis thoughts to the conquest of Naples, and called upon Venice to march\r\nwith him as became a good ally, the Republic made it quite clear that\r\nshe was not disposed to move unless there was to be some profit to\r\nherself. She pointed out that Mantua and Ferrara were in the same case\r\nas Bologna, for having failed to lend assistance to the French in the\r\nhour of need, and proposed to Louis XII the conquest and division of\r\nthose territories.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood, and Cesare had perforce to await the conclusion\r\nof the Pisan War in which the French were engaged, confident, however,\r\nthat, once that was at an end, Louis, in his anxiety to maintain\r\nfriendly relations with the Pope, would be able to induce Venice to\r\nwithdraw her protection from Rimini and Faenza. So much accomplished for\r\nhim, he was now in a position to do the rest without the aid of French\r\ntroops if necessary. The Jubilee--protracted for a further year, so vast\r\nand continuous was the concourse of the faithful, 200,000 of whom knelt\r\nin the square before St. Peter’s on Easter Day to receive the Pope’s\r\nblessing--was pouring vast sums of money into the pontifical coffers,\r\nand for money men were to be had in plenty by a young condottiero whose\r\nfame had been spreading ever since his return from the Romagna. He was\r\nnow the hope of the soldiers of fortune who abounded in Italy, attracted\r\nthither from all quarters by the continual opportunities for employment\r\nwhich that tumultuous land afforded.\r\n\r\nIt is in speaking of him at about this time, and again praising his\r\npersonal beauty and fine appearance, that Capello says of him that, if\r\nhe lives, he will be one of Italy’s greatest captains.\r\n\r\nSuch glimpses as in the pages of contemporary records we are allowed\r\nof Cesare during that crowded time of the Papal Jubilee are slight and\r\nfleeting. On April 13 we see him on horseback accompanying the Pope\r\nthrough Rome in the cavalcade that visited the four Basilicas to win the\r\nindulgence offered, and, as usual, he is attended by his hundred armed\r\ngrooms in black.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion we behold him very differently engaged--giving an\r\nexhibition of his superb physical gifts, his strength, his courage, and\r\nhis matchless address. On June 24, at a bull-fight held in Rome--Spanish\r\ntauromachia having been introduced from Naples, where it flourished\r\nunder the Aragon dominion--he went down into the arena, and on\r\nhorseback, armed only with a light lance, he killed five wild bulls.\r\nBut the master-stroke he reserved for the end. Dismounting, and taking\r\na double­handed sword to the sixth bull that was loosed against him, he\r\nbeheaded the great beast at one single stroke, “a feat which all Rome\r\nconsidered great.”\r\n\r\nThus sped the time of waiting, and meanwhile he gathered about him a\r\nCourt not only of captains of fortune, but of men of art and letters,\r\nwhom he patronized with a liberality--indeed, a prodigality--so\r\ngreat that it presently became proverbial, and, incidentally, by its\r\nproportions provoked his father’s disapproval. In the brilliant group of\r\nmen of letters who enjoyed his patronage were such writers as Justolo,\r\nSperulo, and that unfortunate poet Serafino Cimino da Aquila, known to\r\nfame and posterity as the great Aquilano. And it would be, no doubt,\r\nduring these months that Pier di Lorenzo painted that portrait of Cesare\r\nwhich Vasari afterwards saw in Florence, but which, unfortunately, is\r\nnot now known to exist. Bramante, too, was of his Court at this time, as\r\nwas Michelangelo Buonarroti, whose superb group of “Mercy,” painted for\r\nCardinal de Villiers, had just amazed all Rome. With Pinturicchio, and\r\nLeonardi da Vinci--whom we shall see later beside Cesare--Michelangelo\r\nwas ever held in the highest esteem by the duke.\r\n\r\nThe story of that young sculptor’s leap into fame may not be so widely\r\nknown but that its repetition may be tolerated here, particularly since,\r\nremotely at least, it touches Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1496, young Buonarroti, at the age of twenty-three, came from\r\nFlorence to Rome to seek his fortune at the opulent Pontifical Court, he\r\nbrought a letter of recommendation to Cardinal Sforza-Riario. This was\r\nthe time of the great excavations about Rome; treasures of ancient art\r\nwere daily being rescued from the soil, and Cardinal Sforza-Riario was a\r\ngreat dilletante and collector of the antique. With pride of possession,\r\nhe conducted the young sculptor through his gallery, and, displaying his\r\nstatuary to him, inquired could he do anything that might compare with\r\nit. If the cardinal meant to use the young Florentine cavalierly, his\r\npunishment was immediate and poetic, for amid the antiques Michelangelo\r\nbeheld a sleeping Cupid which he instantly claimed as his own work.\r\nRiario was angry; no doubt suspicious, too, of fraud. This Cupid\r\nwas--as its appearance showed--a genuine antique, which the cardinal had\r\npurchased from a Milanese dealer for two hundred ducats. Michelangelo,\r\nin a passion, named the dealer--one Baldassare--to whom he had sent\r\nthe statue after treating it, with the questionable morality of the\r\ncinquecentist, so as to give it the appearance of having lain in the\r\nground, to the end that Baldassare might dispose of it as an antique.\r\n\r\nHis present fury arose from his learning the price paid by the cardinal\r\nto Baldassare, from whom Michelangelo had received only thirty ducats.\r\nIn his wrath he demanded--very arbitrarily it seems--the return of his\r\nstatue. But to this the cardinal would not consent until Baldassare had\r\nbeen arrested and made to disgorge the money paid him. Then, at last,\r\nSforza-Riario complied with Michelangelo’s demands and delivered him his\r\nCupid--a piece of work whose possession had probably ceased to give any\r\npleasure to that collector of the antique.\r\n\r\nBut the story was bruited abroad, and cultured Rome was agog to see the\r\nstatue which had duped so astute a judge as Sforza-Riario. The fame of\r\nthe young sculptor spread like a ripple over water, and it was Cesare\r\nBorgia--at that time still Cardinal of Valencia who bought the Cupid.\r\nYears later he sent it to Isabella d’Este, assuring her that it had not\r\nits equal among contemporary works of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE MURDER OF ALFONSO OF ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of an event which, despite the light\r\nthat so many, and with such assurance, have shed upon it, remains\r\nwrapped in uncertainty, and presents a mystery second only to that of\r\nthe murder of the Duke of Gandia.\r\n\r\nIt was, you will remember, in July of 1498 that Lucrezia took a second\r\nhusband in Alfonso of Aragon, the natural son of Alfonso II of Naples\r\nand nephew of Federigo, the reigning king. He was a handsome boy\r\nof seventeen at the time of his marriage--one year younger than\r\nLucrezia--and, in honour of the event and in compliance with the Pope’s\r\ninsistence, he was created by his uncle Duke of Biselli and Prince of\r\nSalerno. On every hand the marriage was said to be a love-match, and of\r\nit had been born, in November of 1499, the boy Roderigo.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1500, at about the third hour of the night, Alfonso was\r\nassaulted and grievously wounded--mortally, it was said at first--on the\r\nsteps of St. Peter’s.\r\n\r\nBurchard’s account of the affair is that the young prince was assailed\r\nby several assassins, who wounded him in the head, right arm, and knee.\r\nLeaving him, no doubt, for dead, they fled down the steps, at the foot\r\nof which some forty horsemen awaited them, who escorted them out of the\r\ncity by the Pertusa Gate. The prince was residing in the palace of the\r\nCardinal of Santa Maria in Portico, but so desperate was his condition\r\nthat those who found him upon the steps of the Basilica bore him into\r\nthe Vatican, where he was taken to a chamber of the Borgia Tower, whilst\r\nthe Cardinal of Capua at once gave him absolution in articulo mortis.\r\n\r\nThe deed made a great stir in Rome, and was, of course, the subject\r\nof immediate gossip, and three days later Cesare issued an edict\r\nforbidding, under pain of death, any man from going armed between Sant’\r\nAngelo and the Vatican.\r\n\r\nNews of the event was carried immediately to Naples, and King Federigo\r\nsent his own physician, Galieno, to treat and tend his nephew. In the\r\ncare of that doctor and a hunchback assistant, Alfonso lay ill of his\r\nwounds until August 17, when suddenly be died, to the great astonishment\r\nof Rome, which for some time had believed him out of danger. In\r\nrecording his actual death, Burchard is at once explicit and reticent to\r\nan extraordinary degree. “Not dying,” he writes, “from the wound he had\r\ntaken, he was yesterday strangled in his bed at the nineteenth hour.”\r\n\r\nBetween the chronicling of his having been wounded on the steps of St.\r\nPeter’s and that of his death, thirty-three days later, there is no\r\nentry in Burchard’s diary relating to the prince, nor anything that can\r\nin any way help the inquirer to a conclusion; whilst, on the subject of\r\nthe strangling, not another word does the Master of Ceremonies add\r\nto what has above been quoted. That he should so coldly--almost\r\ncynically--state that Alfonso was strangled, without so much as\r\nsuggesting by whom, is singular in one who, however grimly laconic, is\r\nseldom reticent--notwithstanding that he may have been so accounted by\r\nthose who despaired of finding in his diary the confirmation of such\r\npoints of view as they happen to have chosen and of such matters as it\r\npleased them to believe and propagate.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Alfonso’s body was borne, without pomp, to St.\r\nPeter’s, and placed in the Chapel of Santa Maria delle Febbre. It was\r\naccompanied by Francesco Borgia, Archbishop of Cosenza.\r\n\r\nThe doctor who had been in attendance upon the deceased and the\r\nhunchback were seized, taken to Sant’ Angelo and examined, but shortly\r\nthereafter set at liberty.\r\n\r\nSo far we are upon what we may consider safe ground. Beyond that we\r\ncannot go, save by treading the uncertain ways of speculation, and by\r\nfollowing the accounts of the various rumours circulated at the time.\r\nFormal and absolutely positive evidence of the author of Alfonso’s\r\nmurder there is none.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian ambassador, the ineffable, gossip­mongering Paolo Capello,\r\nwhom we have seen possessed of the fullest details concerning the Duke\r\nof Gandia’s death--although he did not come to Rome until two and a half\r\nyears after the crime--is again as circumstantial in this instance. You\r\nsee in this Capello the forerunner of the modern journalist of the baser\r\nsort, the creature who prowls in quest of scraps of gossip and items of\r\nscandal, and who, having found them, does not concern himself greatly\r\nin the matter of their absolute truth so that they provide him with\r\nsensational “copy.” It is this same Capello, bear in mind, who gives\r\nus the story of Cesare’s murdering in the Pope’s very arms that Pedro\r\nCaldes who is elsewhere shown to have fallen into Tiber and been\r\ndrowned, down to the lurid details of the blood’s spurting into the\r\nPope’s face.\r\n\r\nHis famous Relazione to the Senate in September of 1500 is little better\r\nthan an epitome of all the scandal current in Rome during his sojourn\r\nthere as ambassador, and his resurrection of the old affair of the\r\nmurder of Gandia goes some way towards showing the spirit by which he\r\nwas actuated and his love of sensational matter. It has pleased most\r\nwriters who have dealt with the matter of the murder of Alfonso of\r\nAragon to follow Capello’s statements; consequently these must be\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nHe writes from Rome--as recorded by Sanuto--that on July 16 Alfonso of\r\nBiselli was assaulted on the steps of St. Peter’s, and received four\r\nwounds, “one in the head, one in the arm, one in the shoulder, and one\r\nin the back.” That was all that was known to Capello at the time he\r\nwrote that letter, and you will observe already the discrepancy between\r\nhis statement, penned upon hearsay, and Burchard’s account--which,\r\nconsidering the latter’s position at the Vatican, must always be\r\npreferred. According to Burchard the wounds were three, and they were in\r\nthe head, right arm, and knee.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th Capello writes again, and, having stated that Lucrezia--who\r\nwas really prostrate with grief at her husband’s death--was stricken\r\nwith fever, adds that “it is not known who has wounded the Duke of\r\nBiselli, but it is said that it was the same who killed and threw into\r\nTiber the Duke of Gandia. My Lord of Valentinois has issued an edict\r\nthat no one shall henceforth bear arms between Sant’ Angelo and the\r\nVatican.”\r\n\r\nOn the face of it, that edict of Valentinois’ seems to argue vexation at\r\nwhat had happened, and the desire to provide against its repetition--a\r\nprovision hardly likely to be made by the man who had organized the\r\nassault, unless he sought, by this edict, to throw dust into the eyes\r\nof the world; and one cannot associate after the event and the fear of\r\ncriticism with such a nature as Cesare’s or with such a character as\r\nis given him by those who are satisfied that it was he who murdered\r\nBiselli.\r\n\r\nThe rumour that Alfonso had been assailed by the murderer of Gandia is a\r\nreasonable enough rumour, so long as the latter remains unnamed, for\r\nit would simply point to some enemy of the House of Borgia who, having\r\nslain one of its members, now attempts to slay another. Whether Capello\r\nactually meant Cesare when he penned those words on July 19, is not as\r\nobvious as may be assumed, for it is to be borne in mind that, at this\r\ndate, Capello had not yet compiled the “relation” in which he deals with\r\nGandia’s murder.\r\n\r\nOn July 23 he wrote that the duke was very ill, indeed, from the wound\r\nin his head, and on the 28th that he was in danger owing to the same\r\nwound although the fever had abated.\r\n\r\nOn August 18 he announces Alfonso’s death in the following terms: “The\r\nDuke of Biselli, Madonna Lucrezia’s husband, died to-day because he\r\nwas planning the death of the Duke [of Valentinois] by means of an\r\narbalest-bolt when he walked in the garden; and the duke has had him cut\r\nto pieces in his room by his archers.”\r\n\r\nThis “cutting-to-pieces” form of death is one very dear to\r\nthe imagination of Capello, and bears some witness to his\r\nsensation-mongering proclivities.\r\n\r\nComing to matters more public, and upon which his evidence is more\r\nacceptable, he writes on the 20th that some servants of the prince’s\r\nhave been arrested, and that, upon being put to the question, they\r\nconfessed to the prince’s intent to kill the Duke of Valentinois,\r\nadding that a servant of the duke’s was implicated. On the 23rd Capello\r\ncircumstantially confirms this matter of Alfonso’s attempt upon Cesare’s\r\nlife, and states that this has been confessed by the master of Alfonso’s\r\nhousehold, “the brother of his mother, Madonna Drusa.”\r\n\r\nThat is the sum of Capello’s reports to the Senate, as recorded by\r\nSanuto. The rest, the full, lurid, richly-coloured, sensational\r\nstory, is contained in his “relation” of September 20. He prefaces the\r\nnarrative by informing the Senate that the Pope is on very bad terms\r\nwith Naples, and proceeds to relate the case of Alfonso of Aragon as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“He was wounded at the third hour of night near the palace of the Duke\r\nof Valentinois, his brother­in-law, and the prince ran to the Pope,\r\nsaying that he had been wounded and that he knew by whom; and his wife\r\nLucrezia, the Pope’s daughter, who was in the room, fell into anguish.\r\nHe was ill for thirty-three days, and his wife and sister, who is the\r\nwife of the Prince of Squillace, another son of the Pope’s, were with\r\nhim and cooked for him in a saucepan for fear of his being poisoned, as\r\nthe Duke of Valentinois so hated him. And the Pope had him guarded by\r\nsixteen men for fear that the duke should kill him. And when the\r\nPope went to visit him Valentinois did not accompany him, save on one\r\noccasion, when he said that what had not been done at breakfast might be\r\ndone at supper.... On August 17 he [Valentinois] entered the room where\r\nthe prince was already risen from his bed, and, driving out the wife and\r\nsister, called in his man, named Michieli, and had the prince strangled;\r\nand that night he was buried.”\r\n\r\nNow the following points must arise to shake the student’s confidence\r\nin this narrative, and in Capello as an authority upon any of the other\r\nmatters that he relates:\r\n\r\n  (i)  “He was wounded near the palace of the Duke of Valentinois.”  This\r\nlooks exceedingly like an attempt to pile up evidence against Cesare,\r\nand shows a disposition to resort to the invention of it. Whatever may\r\nnot have been known about Alfonso’s death, it was known by everybody\r\nthat he was wounded on the steps of St. Peter’s, and Capello himself,\r\nin his dispatches, had said so at the time. A suspicion that Capello’s\r\nwhole relation is to serve the purpose of heaping odium upon Cesare at\r\nonce arises and receives confirmation when we consider that, as we have\r\nalready said, it is in this same relation that the fiction about Pedro\r\nCaldes finds place and that the guilt of the murder of the Duke of\r\nGandia is definitely fixed upon Cesare.\r\n\r\n  (ii)  “He ran to the Pope ['Corse dal Papa'] saying that he had been\r\nwounded, and that he knew by whom.” A man with a wound in his head\r\nwhich endangered his life for over a week would hardly be conscious on\r\nreceiving it, nor is it to be supposed that, had he been conscious, his\r\nassailants would have departed. It cannot be doubted that they left him\r\nfor dead. He was carried into the palace, and we know, from Burchard,\r\nthat the Cardinal of Capua gave him absolution in articulo mortis, which\r\nabundantly shows his condition. It is unthinkable that he should have\r\nbeen able to “run to the Pope,” doubtful that he should have been able\r\nto speak; and, if he did, who was it reported his words to the Venetian\r\nambassador? Capello wisely refrains from saying.\r\n\r\n  (iii)  Lucrezia and Sancia attempt to protect him from poison by\r\ncooking his food in his room. This is quite incredible. Even admitting\r\nthe readiness to do so on the part of these princesses, where was the\r\nneed, considering the presence of the doctor--admitted by Capello--sent\r\nfrom Naples and his hunchback assistant?\r\n\r\n  (iv)  “The Pope had him guarded by sixteen men for fear the duke should\r\nkill him.” Yet when, according to Capello, the duke comes on his\r\nmurderous errand, attended only by Michieli (who has been generally\r\nassumed by writers to have been Don Michele da Corella, one of Cesare’s\r\ncaptains), where were these sixteen guards? Capello mentions the\r\ndismissal only of Lucrezia and Sancia.\r\n\r\n  (v)  “Valentinois...said that what had not been done at breakfast might\r\nbe done at supper.” It will be observed that Capello never once\r\nconsiders it necessary to give his authorities for anything that he\r\nstates. It becomes, perhaps, more particularly noteworthy than usual in\r\nthe case of this reported speech of Cesare’s. He omits to say to whom\r\nCesare addressed those sinister words, and who reported them to him.\r\nThe statement is hardly one to be accepted without that very necessary\r\nmention of authorities, nor can we conceive Capello omitting them had he\r\npossessed them.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that it is scarcely necessary to go outside of Capello’s\r\nown relation for the purpose of traversing the statements contained in\r\nit, so far as the death of Alfonso of Aragon is concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, still to be considered that, if Alfonso knew who had\r\nattempted his life--as Capello states that he told the Pope--and knew\r\nthat he was in hourly danger of death from Valentinois, it may surely\r\nbe taken for granted that he would have imparted the information to\r\nthe Neapolitan doctor sent him by his uncle, who must have had his\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nWe know that, after the prince’s death, the physician and his hunchback\r\nassistant were arrested, but subsequently released. They returned\r\nto Naples, and in Naples, if not elsewhere, the truth must have been\r\nknown--definite and authentic facts from the lips of eye-witnesses, not\r\nmere matters of rumour, as was the case in Rome. It is to Neapolitan\r\nwritings, then, that we must turn for the truth of this affair; and\r\nyet from Naples all that we find is a rumour--the echo of the Roman\r\nrumour--“They say,” writes the Venetian ambassador at the Court of King\r\nFederigo, “that he was killed by the Pope’s son.”\r\n\r\nA more mischievous document than Capello’s Relazione can seldom have\r\nfound its way into the pages of history; it is the prime source of\r\nseveral of the unsubstantiated accusations against Cesare Borgia upon\r\nwhich subsequent writers have drawn--accepting without criticism--and\r\nfrom which they have formed their conclusions as to the duke’s\r\ncharacter. Even in our own times we find the learned Gregorovius\r\nfollowing Capello’s relation step by step, and dealing out this matter\r\nof the murder of the Duke of Biselli in his own paraphrases, as so much\r\nsubstantiated, unquestionable fact. We find in his Lucrezia Borgia the\r\nfollowing statement: “The affair was no longer a mystery. Cesare himself\r\npublicly declared that he had killed the duke because his life had been\r\nattempted by the latter.”\r\n\r\nTo say that Cesare “publicly declared that he had killed the duke” is to\r\nsay a very daring thing, and is dangerously to improve upon Capello. If\r\nit is true that Cesare made this public declaration how does it happen\r\nthat no one but Capello heard him? for in all other documents there is\r\nno more than offered us a rumour of how Alfonso died. Surely it is to\r\nbe supposed that, had Cesare made any such declaration, the letters from\r\nthe ambassadors would have rung with it. Yet they will offer you nothing\r\nbut statements of what is being rumoured!\r\n\r\nNor does Gregorovius confine himself to that in his sedulous following\r\nof Capello’s Relation. He serves up out of Capello the lying story of\r\nthe murder of Pedro Caldes. “What,” he says of Cesare, to support his\r\nview that Cesare murdered Alfonso of Aragon, “could be beyond this\r\nterrible man who had poignarded the Spaniard Pedro Caldes...under the\r\nPope’s very cloak, so that his blood spurted up into the Pope’s face?”\r\n This in his History of Rome. In his Lucrezia Borgia he almost improves\r\nupon it when he says that “The Venetian ambassador, Paolo Capello,\r\nreports how Cesare Borgia stabbed the chamberlain Perotto, etc., but\r\nBurchard makes no mention of the fact.” Of the fact of the stabbing,\r\nBurchard certainly makes no mention; but he does mention that the man\r\nwas accidentally drowned, as has been considered. It is again--and more\r\nflagrantly than ever--a case of proving Cesare guilty of a crime of\r\nwhich there is no conclusive evidence by charging him with another,\r\nwhich--in this instance--there is actually evidence that he did not\r\ncommit.\r\n\r\nBut this is by the way.\r\n\r\nBurchard’s entries in his diary relating to the assault upon Alfonso\r\nof Aragon can no more escape the criticism of the thoughtful than can\r\nCapello’s relation. His forty horsemen, for instance, need explaining.\r\nApart from the fact that this employment of forty horsemen would be\r\nan altogether amazing and incredible way to set about the murder of a\r\nsingle man, it is to be considered that such a troop, drawn up in\r\nthe square before St. Peter’s, must of necessity have attracted some\r\nattention. It was the first hour of the night, remember--according to\r\nBurchard--that is to say, at dusk. Presumably, too, those horsemen\r\nwere waiting when the prince arrived. How then, did he--and why was\r\nhe allowed--to pass them, only to be assailed in ascending the steps?\r\nBurchard, presumably, did not himself see these horsemen; certainly\r\nhe cannot have seen them escorting the murderers to the Pertusa Gate.\r\nTherefore he must have had the matter reported to him. Naturally enough,\r\nhad the horsemen existed, they must have been seen. How, then, does it\r\nhappen that Capello did not hear of them? nor the Florentine ambassador,\r\nwho says that the murderers were four, nor any one else apparently?\r\n\r\nTo turn for a moment to the Florentine ambassador’s letters upon the\r\nsubject, we find in this other Capello--Francesco Capello was his\r\nname--accounts which differ alike from Paolo Capello’s and from\r\nBurchard’ stories.  But he is careful to say that he is simply repeating\r\nthe rumours that are abroad, and cites several different versions that\r\nare current, adding that the truth of the affair is not known to\r\nanybody. His conclusions, however, particularly those given in cipher,\r\npoint to Cesare Borgia as the perpetrator of the deed, and hint at some\r\nsuch motive of retaliation for an attempt upon his own life as that\r\nwhich is given by the ambassador of Venice.\r\n\r\nThere is much mystery in the matter, despite Gregorovius’s assertion\r\nto the contrary--mystery which mere assertion will not dissipate. This\r\nconclusion, however, it is fair to draw: if, on Capello’s evidence,\r\nwe are to accept it that Cesare Borgia is responsible for the death of\r\nAlfonso of Aragon, then, on the same evidence, we must accept the motive\r\nas well as the deed. We must accept as equally exact his thrice-repeated\r\nstatement in letters to the Senate that the prince had planned Cesare’s\r\ndeath by posting crossbow-men to shoot him.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  It is extremely significant that Capello’s Relazione contains no\r\nmention of Alfonso’s plot against Cesare’s life, a matter which, as we\r\nhave seen, had figured so repeatedly in that ambassador’s dispatches\r\nfrom Rome at the time of the event. This omission is yet another proof\r\nof the malicious spirit by which the “relation” was inspired. The\r\nsuppression of anything that might justify a deed attributed to Cesare\r\nreveals how much defamation and detraction were the aims of this\r\nVenetian.\r\n\r\n\r\nEither we must accept all, or we must reject all, that Capello tells us.\r\nIf we reject all, then we are left utterly without information as to how\r\nAlfonso of Aragon died. If we accept all, then we find that it was as\r\na measure of retaliation that Cesare compassed the death of\r\nhis brother-in-law, which made it not a murder, but a private\r\nexecution--justifiable under the circumstances of the provocation\r\nreceived and as the adjustment of these affairs was understood in the\r\nCinquecento.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. RIMINI AND PESARO\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1500, fretting to take the field again, Cesare was\r\noccupied in raising and equipping an army--an occupation which received\r\nan added stimulus when, towards the end of August, Louis de Villeneuve,\r\nthe French ambassador, arrived in Rome with the articles of agreement\r\nsetting forth the terms upon which Louis XII was prepared further\r\nto assist Cesare in the resumption of his campaign. In these it was\r\nstipulated that, in return for such assistance, Cesare should engage\r\nhimself, on his side, to aid the King of France in the conquest of\r\nNaples when the time for that expedition should be ripe. Further, Loius\r\nXII was induced to make representations to Venice to the end that the\r\nRepublic should remove her protection from the Manfredi of Faenza and\r\nthe Malatesta of Rimini.\r\n\r\nVenice being at the time in trouble with the Turk, and more anxious than\r\never to conciliate France and the Pope, was compelled to swallow her\r\nreluctance and submit with the best grace she could assume. Accordingly\r\nshe dispatched her ambassadors to Rome to convey her obedience to the\r\nPope’s Holiness, and formally to communicate the news that she withdrew\r\nher protection from the proscribed fiefs.\r\n\r\nLater in the year--in the month of October--the Senate was to confer\r\nupon Cesare Borgia the highest honour in her gift, the honour of which\r\nthe Venetians were jealous above all else--the honour of Venetian\r\ncitizenship, inscribing his name in the Golden Book, bestowing upon him\r\na palace in Venice and conferring the other marks of distinction usual\r\nto the occasion. One is tempted to ask, Was it in consequence of\r\nPaolo Capello’s lurid Relation that the proud Republic considered him\r\nqualified for such an honour?\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the matter of the Republic’s removal of her\r\nshield from Rimini and Faenza, Alexander received the news of this with\r\nopen joy and celebrated it with festivities in the Vatican, whilst from\r\nbeing angry with Venice and from declaring that the Republic need never\r\nagain look to him for favour, he now veered round completely and assured\r\nthe Venetian envoys, in a burst of gratitude, that he esteemed no Power\r\nin the world so highly. Cesare joined in his father’s expressions\r\nof gratitude and appreciation, and promised that Alexander should be\r\nsucceeded in St. Peter’s Chair by such a Pope as should be pleasing to\r\nVenice, and that, if the cardinals but remained united, the Pontificate\r\nshould go to none but a Venetian.\r\n\r\nThus did Cesare, sincerely or otherwise, attempt to lessen the\r\nRepublic’s chagrin to see him ride lance-on-thigh as conqueror into the\r\ndominions which she so long had coveted.\r\n\r\nFrance once more placed Yves d’Allègre at Cesare’s disposal, and with\r\nhim went six hundred lances and six hundred Swiss foot. These swelled\r\nthe forces which already Cesare had assembled into an army some ten\r\nthousand strong. The artillery was under the command of Vitellozzo\r\nVitelli, whilst Bartolomeo da Capranica was appointed camp-master.\r\nCesare’s banner was joined by a condotta under Paolo Orsini--besides\r\nwhom there were several Roman gentlemen in the duke’s following,\r\nincluding most of those who had formed his guard of honour on the\r\noccasion of his visit to France, and who had since then continued to\r\nfollow his fortunes. Achille Tiberti came to Rome with a condotta which\r\nhe had levied in the Romagna of young men who had been moved by Cesare’s\r\nspreading fame to place their swords at his disposal. A member of the\r\nexiled Malvezzi family of Bologna headed a little troop of fellow-exiles\r\nwhich came to take service with the duke, whilst at Perugia a strong\r\nbody of foot awaited him under Gianpaolo Baglioni.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these condotte, numerous were the adventurers who came\r\nto offer Cesare their swords; indeed he must have possessed much of that\r\npersonal magnetism which is the prime equipment of every born leader,\r\nfor he stirred men to the point of wild enthusiasm in those days,\r\nand inspired other than warriors to bear arms for him. We see men of\r\nletters, such as Justolo, Calmeta, Sperulo, and others throwing\r\ndown their quills to snatch up swords and follow him. Painters, and\r\nsculptors, too, are to be seen abandoning the ideals of art to pursue\r\nthe ugly realities of war in this young condottiero’s train. Among these\r\nartists, bulks the great Pietro Torrigiani. The astounding pen of his\r\nbrother-sculptor, Benvenuto Cellini, has left us a sharp portrait of\r\nthis man, in which he speaks of his personal beauty and tells us that\r\nhe had more the air of a great soldier than a sculptor (which must have\r\nbeen, we fancy, Cellini’s own case). Torrigiani lives in history chiefly\r\nfor two pieces of work widely dissimilar in character--the erection\r\nof the tomb of Henry VII of England, and the breaking of the nose of\r\nMichelangelo Buonarroti in the course of a quarrel which he had with him\r\nin Florence when they were fellow-students under Masaccio. Of nothing\r\nthat he ever did in life was he so proud--as we may gather from\r\nCellini--as of having disfigured Michelangelo, and in that sentiment the\r\nnaïve spirit of his age again peeps forth.\r\n\r\nWe shall also see Leonardo da Vinci joining the duke’s army as\r\nengineer--but that not until some months later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his forces grew daily in Rome, and his time was consumed in\r\norganizing, equipping, and drilling these, to bring about that perfect\r\nunity for which his army was to be conspicuous in spite of the variety\r\nof French, Italian, Spanish, and Swiss elements of which it was\r\ncomposed. So effectively were his troops armed and so excellent was the\r\ndiscipline prevailing among them, that their like had probably never\r\nbefore been seen in the peninsula, and they were to excite--as much\r\nelse of Cesare’s work--the wonder and admiration of that great critic\r\nMacchiavelli.\r\n\r\nSo much, however, was not to be achieved without money, and still more\r\nwould be needed for the campaign ahead. For this the Church provided.\r\nNever had the coffers of the Holy See been fuller than at this moment.\r\nAdditional funds accrued from what is almost universally spoken of as\r\n“the sale of twelve cardinals’ hats.”\r\n\r\nIn that year--in September--twelve new cardinals were appointed, and\r\nupon each of those was levied, as a tax, a tithe of the first year’s\r\nrevenues of the benefices upon which they entered. The only justifiable\r\nexception that can be taken to this lies in the number of cardinals\r\nelected at one time, which lends colour to the assumption that the\r\nsole aim of that election was to raise additional funds for Cesare’s\r\ncampaign. Probably it was also Alexander’s aim further to strengthen his\r\npower with the Sacred College, so that he could depend upon a majority\r\nto ensure his will in all matters. But we are at the moment concerned\r\nwith the matter of the levied tax.\r\n\r\nIt has been dubbed “an atrocious act of simony;” but the reasoning that\r\nso construes it is none so clear. The cardinals’ hats carried with them\r\nvast benefices. These benefices were the property of the Church; they\r\nwere in the gift and bestowal of the Pope, and in the bestowing of them\r\nthe Pope levied a proportionate tax. Setting aside the argument that\r\nthis tax was not an invention of Alexander’s, does such a proceeding\r\nreally amount to a “sale” of benefices? A sale presupposes bargaining, a\r\nmaking of terms between two parties, an adjusting of a price to be paid.\r\nThere is evidence of no such marketing of these benefices; indeed one\r\ncardinal, vowed to poverty, received his hat without the imposition of a\r\ntax, another was Cesare’s brother-in-law, Amanieu d’Albret, who had been\r\npromised the hat a year ago. It is further to be borne in mind that,\r\nfour months earlier, the Pope had levied a similar decima, or tax, upon\r\nthe entire College of Cardinals and every official in the service of the\r\nHoly See, for the purposes of the expedition against the Muslim, who was\r\nin arms against Christianity. Naturally that tax was not popular with\r\nluxurious, self-seeking, cinquecento prelates, who in the main\r\ncared entirely for their own prosperity and not at all for that of\r\nChristianity, and you may realize how, by levying it, Alexander laid\r\nhimself open to harsh criticism.\r\n\r\nThe only impugnable matter in the deed lies, as has been said, in the\r\nnumber of cardinals so created at a batch. But the ends to be served\r\nmay be held to justify, if not altogether, at least in some measure,\r\nthe means adopted. The Romagna war for which the funds were needed was\r\nprimarily for the advancement of the Church, to expunge those faithless\r\nvicars who, appointed by the Holy See and holding their fiefs in trust\r\nfor her, refused payment of just tribute and otherwise so acted as to\r\nalienate from the Church the States which she claimed for her own. Their\r\nrestoration to the Church--however much it might be a means of founding\r\na Borgia dynasty in the Romagna--made for the greater power and glory of\r\nthe Holy See. Let us remember this, and that such was the end which\r\nthat tax, levied upon those newly elected cardinals, went to serve. The\r\naggrandizement of the House of Borgia was certainly one of the results\r\nto be expected from the Romagna campaign, but we are not justified in\r\naccounting it the sole aim and end of that campaign.\r\n\r\nAlexander had this advantage over either Sixtus IV or Innocent VIII--not\r\nto go beyond those Popes whom he had served as Vice-Chancellor, for\r\ninstances of flagrant nepotism--that he at least served two purposes\r\nat once, and that, in aggrandizing his own family, he strengthened the\r\ntemporal power of the Church, whereas those others had done nothing but\r\nundermine it that they might enrich their progeny.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst on this subject of the “sale” of cardinals’ hats, it may not\r\nbe amiss to say a word concerning the “sale” of indulgences with which\r\nAlexander has been so freely charged. Here again there has been too loud\r\nan outcry against Alexander--an outcry whose indignant stridency leads\r\none to suppose that the sale of indulgences was a simony invented by\r\nhim, or else practised by him to an extent shamefully unprecedented.\r\nSuch is very far from being the case. The arch-type of\r\nindulgence-seller--as of all other simoniacal practices--is Innocent\r\nVIII. In his reign we have seen the murderer commonly given to choose\r\nbetween the hangman and the purchase of a pardon, and we have seen the\r\nmoneys so obtained providing his bastard, the Cardinal Francesco Cibo,\r\nwith the means for the luxuriously licentious life whose gross disorders\r\nprematurely killed him.\r\n\r\nTo no such flagitious lengths as these can it be shown that Alexander\r\ncarried the “sale” of the indulgences he dispensed. He had no lack of\r\nprecedent for the practice, and, so far as the actual practice itself\r\nis concerned, it would be difficult to show that it was unjustifiable or\r\nsimoniacal so long as confined within certain well-defined bounds, and\r\nso long as the sums levied by it were properly employed to the benefit\r\nof Christianity. It is a practice comparable to the mulcting of a civil\r\noffender against magisterial laws. Because our magistrates levy fines,\r\nit does not occur to modern critics to say that they sell pardons\r\nand immunity from gaol. It is universally recognized as a wise and\r\ncommendable measure, serving the two­fold purpose of punishing the\r\noffender and benefiting the temporal State against which he has\r\noffended. Need it be less commendable in the case of spiritual offences\r\nagainst a spiritual State? It is more useful than the imposition of the\r\npattering of a dozen prayers at bedtime, and since, no doubt, it falls\r\nmore heavily upon the offender, it possibly makes to an even greater\r\nextent for his spiritual improvement.\r\n\r\nThus considered, this “sale” of indulgences loses a deal of the\r\nheinousness with which it has been invested. The funds so realized go\r\ninto the coffers of the Church, which is fit and proper. What afterwards\r\nbecomes of them at the hands of Alexander opens up another matter\r\naltogether, one in which we cannot close our eyes to the fact that he\r\nwas as undutiful as many another who wore the Ring of the Fisherman\r\nbefore him. Yet this is to be said for him: that, if he plunged his\r\nhands freely into the treasury of the Holy See, at least he had the\r\nability to contrive that this treasury should be well supplied; and the\r\ncircumstance that, when he died, he left the church far wealthier and\r\nmore powerful than she had been for centuries, with her dominions which\r\nhis precursors had wantonly alienated reconsolidated into that powerful\r\nState that was to endure for three hundred years, is an argument to the\r\ncredit of his pontificate not lightly to be set aside.\r\n\r\nImola and Forli had, themselves, applied to the Pontiff to appoint\r\nCesare Borgia their ruler in the place of the deposed Riarii. To these\r\nwas now added Cesena. In July disturbances occurred there between\r\nGuelphs and Ghibellines. Swords were drawn and blood flowed in the\r\nstreets, until the governor was constrained to summon Ercole Bentivogli\r\nand his horse from Forli to quell the rioting. The direct outcome of\r\nthis was that--the Ghibellines predominating in council--Cesena sent an\r\nembassy to Rome to beg his Holiness to give the lordship of the fief\r\nto the Duke of Valentinois. To this the Pope acceded, and on August\r\n2 Cesare was duly appointed Lord Vicar of Cesena. He celebrated his\r\ninvestiture by remitting a portion of the taxes, abolishing altogether\r\nthe duty on flour, and by bringing about a peace between the two\r\nprevailing factions.\r\n\r\nBy the end of September Cesare’s preparations for the resumption of the\r\ncampaign were completed, and early in October (his army fortified in\r\nspirit by the Pope’s blessing) he set out, and made his first halt at\r\nNepi. Lucrezia was there, with her Court and her child Roderigo, having\r\nwithdrawn to this her castle to mourn her dead husband Alfonso; and\r\nthere she abode until recalled to Rome by her father some two months\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThence Cesare pushed on, as swiftly as the foul weather would allow him,\r\nby way of Viterbo, Assisi, and Nocera to cross the Apennines at Gualdo.\r\nHere he paused to demand the release of certain prisoners in the hill\r\nfortress of Fossate, and to be answered by a refusal. Angered by this\r\nresistance of his wishes and determined to discourage others from\r\nfollowing the example of Fossate, he was swift and terrible in his\r\nrejoinder. He seized the Citadel, and did by force what had been refused\r\nto his request. Setting at liberty the prisoners in durance there, he\r\ngave the territory over to devastation by fire and pillage.\r\n\r\nThat done he resumed his march, but the weather retarded him more and\r\nmore. The heavy and continuous rains had reduced the roads to such a\r\ncondition that his artillery fell behind, and he was compelled to call\r\na halt once more, at Deruta, and wait there four days for his guns to\r\novertake him.\r\n\r\nIn Rimini the great House of Malatesta was represented by\r\nPandolfo--Roberto Malatesta’s bastard and successor--a degenerate so\r\ndetested by his subjects that he was known by the name of Pandolfaccio\r\n(a contumelious augmentative, expressing the evil repute in which he was\r\nheld).\r\n\r\nAmong his many malpractices and the many abuses to which he resorted\r\nfor the purposes of extorting money from his long-suffering subjects\r\nwas that of compelling the richer men of Rimini to purchase from him the\r\nestates which he confiscated from the fuorusciti--those who had sought\r\nin exile safety from the anger provoked by their just resentment of his\r\noppressive misrule. He was in the same case as other Romagna tyrants,\r\nand now that Venice had lifted from him her protecting aegis, he had no\r\nillusions as to the fate in store for him. So when once more the\r\ntramp of Cesare Borgia’s advancing legions rang through the Romagna,\r\nPandolfaccio disposed himself, not for battle, but for surrender on the\r\nbest terms that he might succeed in making.\r\n\r\nHe was married to Violante, the daughter of Giovanni Bentivogli of\r\nBologna, and in the first week of October he sent her, with their\r\nchildren, to seek shelter at her father’s Court. Himself, he withdrew\r\ninto his citadel--the famous fortress of his terrible grandfather\r\nSigismondo. The move suggested almost that he was preparing to resist\r\nthe Duke of Valentinois, and it may have prompted the message sent him\r\nby the Council to inquire what might be his intention.\r\n\r\nHonour was a thing unknown to this Pandolfaccio--even so much honour\r\nas may be required for a dignified retreat. Since all was lost it but\r\nremained--by his lights--to make the best bargain that he could and get\r\nthe highest possible price in gold for what he was abandoning. So he\r\nreplied that the Council must do whatever it considered to its best\r\nadvantage, whilst to anticipate its members in any offer of surrender,\r\nand thus seek the favour and deserve good terms at the hands of this\r\nman who came to hurl him from the throne of his family, he dispatched a\r\nconfidential servant to Cesare to offer him town and citadel.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime--as Pandolfo fully expected--the Council also sent\r\nproposals of surrender to Cesare, as well as to his lieutenant-general\r\nof Romagna, Bishop Olivieri, at Cesena. The communications had the\r\neffect of bringing Olivieri immediately to Rimini, and there, on October\r\n10, the articles of capitulation were signed by the bishop, as the\r\nduke’s representative, and by Pandolfo Malatesta. It was agreed in these\r\nthat Malatesta should have safe-conduct for himself and his familiars,\r\n3,000 ducats and the value--to be estimated--of the artillery which he\r\nleft in the citadel. Further, for the price of 5,500 ducats he abandoned\r\nalso the strongholds of Sarsina and Medola and the castles of the\r\nMontagna.\r\n\r\nHis tyranny thus disposed of, Pandolfaccio took ship to Ravenna, where\r\nthe price of his dishonour was to be paid him, and in security for\r\nwhich he took with him Gianbattista Baldassare, the son of the ducal\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his departure, to celebrate the bloodless conquest of\r\nRimini, solemn High Mass was sung in the Cathedral, and Bishop Olivieri\r\nreceived the city’s oath of allegiance to the Holy See, whither very\r\nshortly afterwards Rimini sent her ambassadors to express to the Pope\r\nher gratitude for her release from the thraldom of Pandolfaccio.\r\n\r\nLike Rimini, Pesaro too fell without the striking of a blow, for all\r\nthat it was by no means as readily relinquished on the part of its\r\nruler. Giovanni Sforza had been exerting himself desperately for the\r\npast two months to obtain help that should enable him to hold his\r\ntyranny against the Borgia might. But all in vain. His entreaties to the\r\nemperor had met with no response, whilst his appeal to Francesco Gonzaga\r\nof Mantua--whose sister, it will be remembered, had been his first\r\nwife--had resulted in the Marquis’s sending him a hundred men under an\r\nAlbanian, named Giacopo.\r\n\r\nWhat Giovanni was to do with a hundred men it is difficult to conceive,\r\nnor are the motives of Gonzaga’s action clear. We know that at this time\r\nhe was eagerly seeking Cesare’s friendship, sorely uneasy as to the\r\nfate that might lie in store for his own dominions, once the Duke of\r\nValentinois should have disposed of the feudatories of the Church. Early\r\nin that year 1500 he had asked Cesare to stand godfather for his child,\r\nand Cesare had readily consented, whereby a certain bond of relationship\r\nand good feeling had been established between them, which everything\r\nshows Gonzaga most anxious to preserve unsevered. The only reasonable\r\nconclusion in the matter of that condotta of a hundred men is that\r\nGonzaga desired to show friendliness to the Lord of Pesaro, yet was\r\ncareful not to do so to any extent that might be hurtful to Valentinois.\r\n\r\nAs for Giovanni Sforza of whom so many able pens have written so\r\nfeelingly as the constant, unfortunate victim of Borgia ambition, there\r\nis no need to enter into analyses for the purpose of judging him here.\r\nHis own subjects did so in his own day. When a prince is beloved by all\r\nclasses of his people, it must follow that he is a good prince and a\r\nwise ruler; when his subjects are divided into two factions, one to\r\noppose and the other to support him, he may be good or bad, or good\r\nand bad; but when a prince can find none to stand by him in the hour of\r\nperil, it is to be concluded that he has deserved little at the hands of\r\nthose whom he has ruled. The latter is the case of Giovanni Sforza--this\r\nprince whom, Yriarte tells us, “rendered sweet the lives of his\r\nsubjects.” The nobility and the proletariate of Pesaro abhorred him;\r\nthe trader classes stood neutral, anxious to avoid the consequences of\r\npartisanship, since it was the class most exposed to those consequences.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 11--the day after Pandolfo Malatesta had relinquished\r\nRimini--news reached Pesaro that Ercole Bentivogli’s horse was marching\r\nupon the town, in advance of the main body of Cesare’s army. Instantly\r\nthere was an insurrection against Giovanni, and the people, taking\r\nto arms, raised the cry of “Duca!” in acclamation of the Duke of\r\nValentinois, under the very windows of their ruler’s palace.\r\n\r\nGetting together the three hundred men that constituted his army,\r\nGiovanni beat a hasty retreat to Pesaro’s magnificent fortress, and that\r\nsame night he secretly took ship to Ravenna accompanied by the Albanian\r\nGiacopo, and leaving his half-brother, Galeazzo Sforza di Cotignola,\r\nin command of the citadel. Thence Giovanni repaired to Bologna, and,\r\nalready repenting his precipitate flight, he appealed for help to\r\nBentivogli, who was himself uneasy, despite the French protection\r\nhe enjoyed. Similarly, Giovanni addressed fresh appeals to Francesco\r\nGonzaga; but neither of these tyrants could or dared avail him, and,\r\nwhilst he was still imploring their intervention his fief had fallen\r\ninto Cesare’s power.\r\n\r\nErcole Bentivogli, with a small body of horse, had presented himself at\r\nthe gates of Pesaro on October 21, and Galeazzo Sforza, having obtained\r\nsafe-conduct for the garrison, surrendered.\r\n\r\nCesare, meanwhile, was at Fano, where he paused to allow his army to\r\ncome up with him, for he had outridden it from Fossate, through foul\r\nwintry weather, attended only by his light horse. It was said that\r\nhe hoped that Fano might offer itself to him as other fiefs had done,\r\nand--if Pandolfo Collenuccio is correct--he had been counselled by the\r\nPope not to attempt to impose himself upon Fano, but to allow the town\r\na free voice in the matter. If his hopes were as stated, he was\r\ndisappointed in them, for Fano made no offer to him, and matters\r\nremained for the present as they were.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, with the banners of the bull unfurled, he rode into Pesaro\r\nat the head of two thousand men, making his entrance with his wonted\r\npomp, of whose dramatic values he was so fully aware. He was met at the\r\ngates by the Council, which came to offer him the keys of the town, and,\r\ndespite the pouring rain under which he entered the city, the people of\r\nPesaro thronged the streets to acclaim him as he rode.\r\n\r\nHe took up his lodgings at the Sforza Palace, so lately vacated by\r\nGiovanni--the palace where Lucrezia Borgia had held her Court when, as\r\nGiovanni’s wife, she had been Countess of Pesaro and Cotignola. Early on\r\nthe morrow he visited the citadel, which was one of the finest in Italy,\r\nrivalling that of Rimini for strength. On his arrival there, a flourish\r\nof trumpets imposed silence, while the heralds greeted him formally as\r\nLord of Pesaro. He ordered one of the painters in his train to draw up\r\nplans of the fortress to be sent to the Pope, and issued instructions\r\nfor certain repairs and improvements which he considered desirable.\r\n\r\nHere in Pesaro came to him the famous Pandolfo Collenuccio, as envoy\r\nfrom the Duke of Ferrara, to congratulate Cesare upon the victory.\r\nIn sending Collenuccio at such a time Ercole d’Este paid the Duke of\r\nValentinois a subtle, graceful compliment. This distinguished poet,\r\ndramatist, and historian was a native of Pesaro who had been exiled ten\r\nyears earlier by Giovanni--which was the tyrant’s way of showing his\r\ngratitude to the man who, more than any other, had contributed to\r\nthe bastard Sforza’s succession to his father as Lord of Pesaro and\r\nCotignola.\r\n\r\nCollenuccio was one of the few literary men of his day who was not above\r\nusing the Italian tongue, treating it seriously as a language and not\r\nmerely as a debased form of Latin. He was eminent as a juris­consult,\r\nand, being a man of action as well as a man of letters, he had filled\r\nthe office of Podestá in various cities; he had found employment under\r\nLorenzo dei Medici, and latterly under Ercole d’Este, whom we now see\r\nhim representing.\r\n\r\nCesare received him with all honour, sending the master of his\r\nhousehold, Ramiro de Lorqua, to greet him on his arrival and to bear\r\nhim the usual gifts of welcome, of barley, wine, capons, candles,\r\nsweet-meats, etc., whilst on the morrow the duke gave him audience,\r\ntreating him in the friendliest manner, as we see from Collenuccio’s\r\nown report to the Duke of Ferrara. In this he says of Cesare: “He is\r\naccounted valiant, joyous, and open-handed, and it is believed that he\r\nholds honest men in great esteem. Harsh in his vengeance, according to\r\nmany, he is great of spirit and of ambition, athirst for eminence and\r\nfame.”\r\n\r\nCollenuccio was reinstated by Cesare in the possessions of which\r\nGiovanni had stripped him, a matter which so excited the resentment of\r\nthe latter that, when ultimately he returned to his dominions, one of\r\nhis first acts was to avenge it. Collenuccio, fearing that he might not\r\nstand well with the tyrant, had withdrawn from Pesaro. But Giovanni,\r\nwith all semblance of friendliness, treacherously lured him back to cast\r\nhim into prison and have him strangled--a little matter which those who,\r\nto the detriment of the Borgia, seek to make a hero of this Giovanni\r\nSforza, would do well not to suppress.\r\n\r\nA proof of the splendid discipline prevailing in Cesare’s army is\r\nafforded during his brief sojourn in Pesaro. In the town itself, some\r\ntwo thousand of his troops were accommodated, whilst some thousands\r\nmore swarmed in the surrounding country. Occupation by such an army was,\r\nnaturally enough, cause for deep anxiety on the part of a people who\r\nwere but too well acquainted with the ways of the fifteenth­century\r\nmen-at-arms. But here was a general who knew how to curb and control his\r\nsoldiers. Under the pain of death his men were forbidden from indulging\r\nany of the predations or violences usual to their kind; and, as a\r\nconsequence, the inhabitants of Pesaro had little to complain of.\r\n\r\nJustolo gives us a picture of the Duke of Valentinois on the banks of\r\nthe River Montone, which again throws into relief the discipline which\r\nhis very presence--such was the force of his personality--was able to\r\nenforce. A disturbance arose among his soldiers at the crossing of this\r\nriver, which was swollen with rains and the bridge of which had been\r\ndestroyed. It became necessary to effect the crossing in one small\r\nboat--the only craft available--and the men, crowding to the bank,\r\nstormed and fought for precedence until the affair grew threatening.\r\nCesare rode down to the river, and no more than his presence was\r\nnecessary to restore peace. Under that calm, cold eye of his the men\r\ninstantly became orderly, and, whilst he sat his horse and watched them,\r\nthe crossing was soberly effected, and as swiftly as the single craft\r\nwould permit.\r\n\r\nThe duke remained but two days in Pesaro. On the 29th, having appointed\r\na lieutenant to represent him, and a captain to the garrison, he marched\r\nout again, to lie that night at Cattolica and enter Rimini on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nThere again he was received with open arms, and he justified the\r\npeople’s welcome of him by an immediate organization of affairs which\r\ngave universal satisfaction. He made ample provision for the proper\r\nadministration of justice and the preservation of the peace; he recalled\r\nthe fuorusciti exiled by the unscrupulous Pandolfaccio, and he saw them\r\nreinstated in the property of which that tyrant had dispossessed them.\r\nAs his lieutenant in Rimini, with strict injunctions to preserve law\r\nand order, he left Ramiro de Lorqua, when, on November 2, he departed to\r\nmarch upon Faenza, which had prepared for resistance.\r\n\r\nWhat Cesare did in Rimini was no more than he was doing throughout the\r\nRomagna, as its various archives bear witness. They bear witness no less\r\nto his vast ability as an administrator, showing how he resolved the\r\nprevailing chaos into form and order by his admirable organization and\r\nsuppression of injustice. The same archives show us also that he found\r\ntime for deeds of beneficence which endeared him to the people, who\r\neverywhere hailed him as their deliverer from thraldom. It would not be\r\nwise to join in the chorus of those who appear to have taken Cesare’s\r\naltruism for granted. The rejection of the wild stories that picture\r\nhim as a corrupt and murderous monster, utterly inhuman, and lay a dozen\r\nghastly crimes to his account need not entail our viewing Cesare as an\r\nangel of deliverance, a divine agent almost, rescuing a suffering people\r\nfrom oppression out of sheer humanitarianism.\r\n\r\nHe is the one as little as the other. He is just--as Collenuccio wrote\r\nto Ercole d’Este--“great of spirit and of ambition, athirst for\r\neminence and fame.” He was consumed by the desire for power and worldly\r\ngreatness, a colossus of egotism to whom men and women were pieces to\r\nbe handled by him on the chess-board of his ambition, to be sacrificed\r\nruthlessly where necessary to his ends, but to be husbanded and guarded\r\ncarefully where they could serve him.\r\n\r\nWith his eyes upon the career of Cesare Borgia, Macchiavelli was anon to\r\nwrite of principalities newly-acquired, that “however great may be the\r\nmilitary resources of a prince, he will discover that, to obtain firm\r\nfooting in a province, he must engage the favour and interest of the\r\ninhabitants.”\r\n\r\nThat was a principle self-evident to Cesare--the principle upon which\r\nhe acted throughout in his conquest of the Romagna. By causing his new\r\nsubjects to realize at once that they had exchanged an oppressive for a\r\ngenerous rule, he attached them to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE SIEGE OF FAENZA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second campaign of the Romagna had opened for Cesare as easily as\r\nhad the first. So far his conquest had been achieved by little more than\r\na processional display of his armed legions. Like another Joshua, he\r\nreduced cities by the mere blare of his trumpets. At last, however,\r\nhe was to receive a check. Where grown men had fled cravenly at his\r\napproach, it remained for a child to resist him at Faenza, as a woman\r\nhad resisted him at Forli.\r\n\r\nHis progress north from Pesaro was of necessity slow. He paused, as\r\nwe have seen, at Rimini, and he paused again, and for a rather longer\r\nspell, at Forli, so that it was not until the second week of November\r\nthat Astorre Manfredi--the boy of sixteen who was to hold Faenza--caught\r\nin the distance the flash of arms and the banners with the bull device\r\nborne by the host which the Duke of Valentinois led against him.\r\n\r\nAt first it had been Astorre’s intent to follow the examples set him by\r\nMalatesta and Sforza, and he had already gone so far as to remove his\r\nvaluables to Ravenna, whither he, too, meant to seek refuge. But he was\r\nin better case than any of the tyrants so far deposed inasmuch as his\r\nfamily, which had ruled Faenza for two hundred years, had not provoked\r\nthe hatred of its subjects, and these were now ready and willing to\r\nstand loyally by their young lord. But loyalty alone can do little,\r\nunless backed by the might of arms, against such a force as Cesare was\r\nprepared to hurl upon Faenza. This Astorre realized, and for his own\r\nand his subjects’ sake was preparing to depart, when, to his undoing,\r\nsupport reached him from an unexpected quarter.\r\n\r\nBologna--whose ruler, Giovanni Bentivogli, was Astorre’s grandfather--in\r\ncommon with Florence and Urbino, grew daily more and more alarmed at\r\nthe continual tramp of armed multitudes about her frontiers, and at the\r\nsteady growth in numbers and in capacity of this splendid army which\r\nfollowed Casare--an army captained by such enemies of the Bentivogli as\r\nthe Baglioni, the Orsini, and the exiled Malvezzi.\r\n\r\nBentivogli had good grounds for his anxiety, not knowing how long he\r\nmight depend upon the protection of France, and well aware that, once\r\nthat protection was removed, there would be no barrier between Bologna\r\nand Cesare’s manifest intentions concerning her.\r\n\r\nNext to Cesare’s utter annihilation, to check his progress was the\r\ndesire dearest just then to the heart of Bentivogli, and with this end\r\nin view he dispatched Count Guido Torella to Faenza, in mid-October,\r\nwith an offer to assist Astorre with men and money.\r\n\r\nAstorre, who had succeeded Galeotto Manfredi in the tyranny of Faenza at\r\nthe age of three, had been and still continued under the tutelage of\r\nthe Council which really governed his territories. To this Council came\r\nCount Torella with Bentivogli’s offer, adding the proposal that young\r\nAstorre should be sent to Venice for his personal safety. But to this\r\nthe Council replied that it would be useless, if that course were\r\nadopted, to attempt resistance, as the people could only be urged to it\r\nby their affection for their young lord, and that, if he were removed\r\nfrom their midst, they would insist upon surrender.\r\n\r\nNews of these negotiations reached Rome, and on October 24 Alexander\r\nsent Bentivogli his commands to refrain, under pain of excommunication,\r\nfrom interfering in the affairs of Faenza. Bentivogli made a feeble\r\nattempt to mask his disobedience. The troops with which he intended to\r\nassist his grandson were sent ostensibly to Castel Bolognese, but with\r\ninstructions to desert thence and make for Faenza. This they did, and\r\nthus was Astorre strengthened by a thousand men, whilst the work of\r\npreparing his city for resistance went briskly forward.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, ahead of Cesare Borgia, swept Vitellozzo Vitelli with his\r\nhorse into Astorre’s dominions. He descended upon the valley of the\r\nLamone, and commenced hostilities by the capture and occupation of\r\nBrisghella on November 7. The other lesser strongholds and townships\r\noffered no resistance to Cesare’s arms. Indeed they were induced into\r\nready rebellion against their lord by Dionigio di Naldo--the sometime\r\ndefender of Imola, who had now taken service with Cesare.\r\n\r\nOn November 10 Cesare himself halted his host beneath the walls of\r\nFaenza and called upon the town to surrender. Being denied, he encamped\r\nhis army for the siege. He chose the eastern side of the town, between\r\nthe rivers Lamone and Marzano, and, that his artillery might have free\r\nplay, he caused several houses to be demolished.\r\n\r\nIn Faenza itself, meanwhile, the easy conquest of the valley had not\r\nproduced a good effect. Moreover, the defenders had cause to fear\r\ntreachery within their gates, for a paper had been picked up out of the\r\nmoat containing an offer of terms of surrender. It had been shot into\r\nthe castle attached to an arbalest­bolt, and was intended for the\r\ncastellan Castagnini. This Castagnini was arrested, thrown into prison,\r\nand his possessions confiscated, whilst the Council placed the citadel\r\nin the hands of four of its own members together with Gianevangelista\r\nManfredi--Astorre’s half-brother, and a bastard of Galeotto’s. These\r\nset about defending it against Cesare, who had now opened fire. The duke\r\ncaused the guns to be trained upon a certain bastion through which he\r\njudged that a good assault might be delivered and an entrance gained.\r\nNight and day was the bombardment of that bastion kept up, yet without\r\nproducing visible effect until the morning of the 20th, when suddenly\r\none of its towers collapsed thunderously into the moat.\r\n\r\nInstantly, and without orders, the soldiers, all eager to be among the\r\nfirst to enter, flung themselves forward in utter and fierce disorder to\r\nstorm the breach. Cesare, at breakfast--as he himself wrote to the Duke\r\nof Urbino--sprang up at the great noise, and, surmising what was taking\r\nplace, dashed out to restrain his men. But the task was no easy one,\r\nfor, gathering excitement and the frenzy of combat as they ran, they had\r\nalready gained the edge of the ditch, and thither Cesare was forced to\r\nfollow them, using voice and hands to beat back again.\r\n\r\nAt last he succeeded in regaining control of them, and in compelling\r\nthem to make an orderly retreat, and curb their impatience until the\r\ntime for storming should have come, which was not yet. In the affair\r\nCesare had a narrow escape from a stone-shot fired from the castle,\r\nwhilst one of his officers--Onorio Savelli--was killed by a cannon-ball\r\nfrom the duke’s own guns, whose men, unaware of what was taking place,\r\nwere continuing the bombardment.\r\n\r\nHitherto the army had been forced to endure foul weather--rain, fogs,\r\nand wind; but there was worse come. Snow began to fall on the morning of\r\nthe 22nd. It grew to a storm, and the blizzard continued all that day,\r\nwhich was a Sunday, all night, and all the following day, and lashed the\r\nmen pitilessly and blindingly. The army, already reduced by shortness of\r\nvictuals, was now in a miserable plight in its unsheltered camp, and the\r\ndefenders of Faenza, as if realizing this, made a sortie on the 23rd,\r\nfrom which a fierce fight ensued, with severe loss to both sides. On the\r\n25th the snow began again, whereupon the hitherto unconquerable Cesare,\r\ndefeated at last by the elements and seeing that his men could not\r\npossibly continue to endure the situation, was compelled to strike camp\r\non the 26th and go into winter quarters, no doubt with immense chagrin\r\nat leaving so much work unaccomplished.\r\n\r\nSo he converted the siege into a blockade, closing all roads that lead\r\nto Faenza, with a view to shutting out supplies from the town; and he\r\ndistributed troops throughout the villages of the territory with orders\r\nconstantly to harass the garrison and allow it no rest.\r\n\r\nHe also sent an envoy with an offer of terms of surrender, but the\r\nCouncil rejected it with the proud answer that its members “had agreed,\r\nin general assembly, to defend the dominions of Manfredi to the death.”\r\n\r\nThereupon Cesare withdrew to Forli with 150 lances and 2,500 foot, and\r\nhere he affords a proof of his considerateness. The town had already\r\nendured several occupations and the severities of being the seat of war\r\nduring the siege of the citadel. Cesare was determined that it should\r\nfeel the present occupation as little as possible; so he issued an order\r\nto the inhabitants upon whom his soldiers were billeted to supply the\r\nmen only with bed, light, and fire. What more they required must be\r\npaid for, and, to avoid disputes as to prices of victuals and other\r\nnecessaries, he ordered the Council to draw up a tariff, and issued an\r\nedict forbidding his soldiers, under pain of death, from touching any\r\nproperty of the townsfolk. Lest they should doubt his earnestness,\r\nhe hanged two of his soldiers on December 7--a Piedmontese and a\r\nGascon--and on the 13th a third, all from the windows of his own palace,\r\nand all with a label hanging from their feet proclaiming that they had\r\nbeen hanged for taking goods of others in spite of the ban of the Lord\r\nDuke, etc.\r\n\r\nHe remained in Forli until the 23rd, when he departed to Cesena, which\r\nwas really his capital in Roomagna, and in the huge citadel of which\r\nthere was ample accommodation for the troops that accompanied him. In\r\nForli he left, as his lieutenants, the Bishop of Trani and Don Michele\r\nda Corella--the “Michieli” of Capello’s Relation and the “Michelotto”\r\n of so many Borgia fables. That this officer ruled the soldiers left with\r\nhim in Forli in accordance with the stern example set him by his master\r\nwe know from the chronicles of Bernardi.\r\n\r\nIn Cesena the duke occupied the splendid palace of Malatesta Novello,\r\nwhich had been magnificently equipped for him, and there, on Christmas\r\nEve, he entertained the Council of the town and other important citizens\r\nto a banquet worthy of the repuation for lavishness which he enjoyed. He\r\nwas very different in this from his father, whose table habits were of\r\nthe most sparing--to which, no doubt, his Holiness owed the wonderful,\r\nalmost youthful vigour which he still enjoyed in this his seventieth\r\nyear. It was notorious that ambassadors cared little for invitations to\r\nthe Pope’s table, where the meal never consisted of more than one dish.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day the duke attended Mass at the Church of San Giovanni\r\nEvangelista with great pomp, arrayed in the ducal chlamys and followed\r\nby his gentlemen. With these young patricians Cesare made merry during\r\nthe days that followed. The time was spent in games and joustings,\r\nin all of which the duke showed himself freely, making display of his\r\nphysical perfections, fully aware, no doubt, of what a short cut these\r\nafforded him to the hearts of the people, ever ready to worship physical\r\nbeauty, prowess, and address.\r\n\r\nYet business was not altogether neglected, for on January 4 he went\r\nto Porto Cesenatico, and there published an edict against all who had\r\npractised with the fuorusciti from his States, forbidding the offence\r\nunder pain of death and forfeiture of possessions.\r\n\r\nHe remained in winter quarters until the following April, from which,\r\nhowever, it is not to be concluded that Faenza was allowed to be at\r\npeace for that spell. The orders which he had left behind him, that the\r\ntown was constantly to be harassed, were by no means neglected. On the\r\nnight of January 21, by arrangement with some of the inhabitants of the\r\nbeleaguered city, the foot surrounding Faenza attempted to surprise the\r\ngarrison by a secret escalade. They were, however, discovered betimes in\r\nthe attempt and repulsed, some who had the mischance--as it happened--to\r\ngain the battlements before the alarm was raised being taken and hanged.\r\nThe duke’s troops, however, consoled themselves by capturing Russi\r\nand Solarolo, the last two strongholds in the valley that had held for\r\nAstorre.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cesare and his merry young patricians spent the time as\r\nagreeably as might be in Cesena during that carnival. The author of\r\nthe Diario Cesenate is moved by the duke’s pastimes to criticize him\r\nseverely as indulging in amusements unbecoming the dignity of his\r\nstation. He is particularly shocked to know that the duke should have\r\ngone forth in disguise with a few companions to repair to carnival\r\nfestivities in the surrounding villages and there to wrestle with the\r\nrustics. It is not difficult to imagine the discomfiture suffered by\r\nmany a village Hercules at the hands of this lithe young man, who could\r\nbehead a bull at a single stroke of a spadoon and break a horseshoe in\r\nhis fingers. The diary in question, you will have gathered, is that of\r\na pedant, prim and easily scandalized. So much being obvious, it is\r\nnoteworthy that Cesare’s conduct should have afforded him no subject\r\nfor graver strictures than these, Cesare being such a man as has been\r\nrepresented, and the time being that of carnival when licence was\r\nallowed full play.\r\n\r\nThe Pope accounted that the check endured by Cesare before Faenza was\r\ndue not so much to the foul weather by which his army had been beset as\r\nto the assistance which Giovanni Bentivogli had rendered his grandson\r\nAstorre, and bitter were the complaints of it which he addressed to\r\nthe King of France. Alarmed by this, and fearing that he might have\r\ncompromised himself and jeopardized the French protection by his action\r\nin the matter, Bentivogli made haste to recall his troops, and did in\r\nfact withdraw them from Faenza early in December, shortly after Cesare\r\nhad gone into winter quarters. Nevertheless, the Pope’s complaints\r\ncontinued, Alexander in his secret, crafty heart no doubt rejoicing that\r\nBentivogli should have afforded him so sound a grievance. As Louis\r\nXII desired, for several reasons, to stand well with Rome, he sent an\r\nembassy to Bentivogli to express his regret and censure of the latter’s\r\nintervention in the affairs of Faenza. He informed Bentivogli that the\r\nPope was demanding the return of Bologna to the States of the Church,\r\nand, without expressing himself clearly as to his own view of the\r\nmatter, he advised Bentivogli to refrain from alliances with the\r\nenemies of the Holy See and to secure Bologna to himself by some sound\r\narrangement. This showed Bentivogli in what danger he stood, and his\r\nuneasiness was increased by the arrival at Modena of Yves d’Allègre,\r\nsent by the King of France with a condotta of 500 horse for purposes\r\nwhich were not avowed but which Bentivogli sorely feared might prove to\r\nbe hostile to himself.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of February Cesare moved his quarters from Cesena to\r\nImola, and thence he sent his envoys to demand winter quarters for his\r\ntroops in Castel Bolognese. This flung Bentivogli into positive terror,\r\nas he interpreted the request as a threat of invasion. Castel Bolognese\r\nwas too valuable a stronghold to be so lightly placed in the duke’s\r\nhands. Thence Bentivogli might, in case of need, hold the duke in check,\r\nthe fortress commanding, as it did, the road from Imola to Faenza.\r\nHe had the good sense, however, to compromise the matter by returning\r\nCesare an offer of accommodation for his men with victuals, artillery,\r\netc., but without the concession of Castel Bolognese. With this Cesare\r\nwas forced to be content, there being no reasonable grounds upon which\r\nhe could decline so generous an offer. It was a cunning concession on\r\nBentivogli’s part, for, without strengthening the duke’s position, it\r\nyet gave the latter what he ostensibly required, and left no cause for\r\ngrievance and no grounds upon which to molest Bologna. So much was this\r\nthe case that on February 26 the Pope wrote to Bentivogli expressing his\r\nthanks at the assistance which he had thus given Cesare in the Faenza\r\nemprise.\r\n\r\nIt was during this sojourn of Cesare’s at Imola that the abduction took\r\nplace of Dorotea Caracciolo, the young wife of Gianbattista Caracciolo,\r\na captain of foot in the Venetian service. The lady, who was attached to\r\nthe Duchess of Urbino, had been residing at the latter’s Court, and in\r\nthe previous December Caracciolo had begged leave of the Council of Ten\r\nthat he might himself go to Urbino for the purpose of escorting her to\r\nVenice. The Council, however, had replied that he should send for her,\r\nand this the captain had done. Near Cervia, on the confines of the\r\nVenetian territory, towards evening of February 14, the lady’s escort\r\nwas set upon by ten well­armed men, and rudely handled by them, some\r\nbeing wounded and one at least killed, whilst the lady and a woman who\r\nwas with her were carried off.\r\n\r\nThe Podestá of Cervia reported to the Venetian Senate that the abductors\r\nwere Spaniards of the army of the Duke of Valentinois, and it was feared\r\nin Venice--according to Sanuto--that the deed might be the work of\r\nCesare.\r\n\r\nThe matter contained in that Relation of Capello’s to the Senate must\r\nby now have been widespread, and of a man who could perpetrate the\r\nwickednesses therein divulged anything could be believed. Indeed, it\r\nseems to have followed that, where any act of wickedness was brought to\r\nlight, at once men looked to see if Cesare might not be responsible,\r\nnor looked close enough to make quite sure. To no other cause can it be\r\nassigned that, in the stir which the Senate made, the name of Cesare\r\nwas at once suggested as that of the abductor, and this so broadly that\r\nletters poured in upon him on all sides begging him to right this\r\ncruel wrong. So much do you see assumed, upon no more evidence than\r\nwas contained in that letter from the Podestá of Cervia, which went no\r\nfurther than to say that the abductors were “Spaniards of the Duke of\r\nValentinois’ army.” The envoy Manenti was dispatched at once to Cesare\r\nby the Senate, and he went persuaded, it is clear, that Cesare Borgia\r\nwas the guilty person. He enlisted the support of Monsieur de Trans (the\r\nFrench ambassador then on his way to Rome) and that of Yves d’Allègre,\r\nand he took them with him to the Duke at Imola.\r\n\r\nThere, acting upon his strong suspicions, Manenti appears to have taken\r\na high tone, representing to the duke that he had done an unworthy\r\nthing, and imploring him to restore the lady to her husband. Cesare’s\r\npatience under the insolent assumption in justification of which Manenti\r\nhad not a single grain of evidence to advance, is--guilty or innocent--a\r\nrare instance of self-control. He condescended to take oath that he had\r\nnot done this thing which they imputed to him. He admitted that he had\r\nheard of the outrage, and he expressed the belief that it was the work\r\nof one Diego Ramires--a captain of foot in his service. This Ramires, he\r\nexplained, had been in the employ of the Duke of Urbino, and in Urbino\r\nhad made the acquaintance and fallen enamoured of the lady; and he added\r\nthat the fellow had lately disappeared, but that already he had set on\r\nfoot a search for him, and that, once taken, he would make an example of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion he begged that the Republic should not believe this thing\r\nagainst him, assuring the envoy that he had not found the ladies of the\r\nRomagna so difficult that he should be driven to employ such rude and\r\nviolent measures.\r\n\r\nThe French ambassador certainly appears to have attached implicit faith\r\nto Cesare’s statement, and he privately informed Manenti that Ramires\r\nwas believed to be at Medola, and that the Republic might rest assured\r\nthat, if he were taken, exemplary justice would be done.\r\n\r\nAll this you will find recorded in Sanuto. After that his diary\r\nentertains us with rumours which were reaching Venice, now that the\r\ndeed was the duke’s, now that the lady was with Ramires. Later the two\r\nrumours are consolidated into one, in a report of the Podestá of Cervia\r\nto the effect that “the lady is in the Castle of Forli with Ramires, and\r\nthat he took her there by order of the duke.” The Podestá says that a\r\nman whom he sent to gather news had this story from one Benfaremo. But\r\nhe omits to say who and what is this Benfaremo, and what the source of\r\nhis information.\r\n\r\nMatters remaining thus, and the affair appearing in danger of being\r\nforgotten, Caracciolo goes before the Senate on March 16 and implores\r\npermission to deal with it himself. This permission is denied him, the\r\nDoge conceiving that the matter will best be dealt with by the Senate,\r\nand Caracciolo is ordered back to his post at Gradisca. Thence he writes\r\nto the Senate on March 30 that he is certain his wife is in the citadel\r\nof Forli.\r\n\r\nAfter this Sanuto does not mention the matter again until December of\r\n1503--nearly three years later--when we gather that, under pressure\r\nof constant letters from the husband, the Venetian ambassador at the\r\nVatican makes so vigorous a stir that the lady is at last delivered up,\r\nand goes for the time being into a convent. But we are not told where or\r\nhow she is found, nor where the convent in which she seeks shelter. That\r\nis Sanuto’s first important omission.\r\n\r\nAnd now an odd light is thrown suddenly upon the whole affair, and\r\nit begins to look as if the lady had been no unwilling victim of an\r\nabduction, but, rather, a party to an elopement. She displays a positive\r\nreluctance to return to her husband; she is afraid to do so--“in\r\nfear for her very life”--and she implores the Senate to obtain from\r\nCaracciolo some security for her, or else to grant her permission to\r\nwithdraw permanently to a convent.\r\n\r\nThe Senate summons the husband, and represents the case to him. He\r\nassures the Senate that he has forgiven his wife, believing her to be\r\ninnocent. This, however, does not suffice to allay her uneasiness--or\r\nher reluctance--for on January 4, 1504, Sanuto tells us that the Senate\r\nhas received a letter of thanks from her in which she relates her\r\nmisfortunes, and in which again she begs that her husband be compelled\r\nto pledge security to treat her well (“darli buona vita”) or else that\r\nshe should be allowed to return to her mother. Of the nature of the\r\nmisfortunes which he tells us she related in her letter, Sanuto says\r\nnothing. That is his second important omission.\r\n\r\nThe last mention of the subject in Sanuto relates to her restoration to\r\nher husband. He tells us that Caracciolo received her with great joy;\r\nbut he is silent on the score of the lady’s emotions on that occasion.\r\n\r\nThere you have all that is known of Dorotea Caracciolo’s abduction,\r\nwhich later writers--including Bembo in his Historiae--have positively\r\nassigned to Cesare Borgia, drawing upon their imagination to fill up the\r\nlacunae in the story so as to support their point of view.\r\n\r\nThose lacunae, however, are invested with a certain eloquence which it\r\nis well not to disregard. Admitting that the construing of silence into\r\nevidence is a dangerous course, all fraught with pitfalls, yet it seems\r\npermissible to pose the following questions:\r\n\r\nIf the revelation of the circumstances under which she was found, the\r\nrevelations contained in her letters to the Senate, and the revelations\r\nwhich one imagines must have followed her return to her husband, confirm\r\npast rumours and convict Cesare of the outrage, how does it happen that\r\nSanuto--who has never failed to record anything that could tell against\r\nCesare--should be silent on the matter? And how does it happen that so\r\nmany pens that busied themselves greedily with scandal that touched the\r\nBorgias should be similarly silent? Is it unreasonable to infer that\r\nthose revelations did not incriminate him--that they gave the lie to all\r\nthe rumours that had been current? If that is not the inference, then\r\nwhat is?\r\n\r\nIt is further noteworthy that on January 16--after Dorotea’s letter to\r\nthe Senate giving the details of her misfortunes, which details Sanuto\r\nhas suppressed--Diego Ramires, the real and known abductor, is still the\r\nobject of a hunt set afoot by some Venetians. Would that be the case had\r\nher revelations shown Ramires to be no more than the duke’s instrument?\r\nPossibly; but not probably. In such a case he would not have been worth\r\nthe trouble of pursuing.\r\n\r\nReasonably may it be objected: How, if Cesare was not guilty, does it\r\nhappen that he did not carry out his threat of doing exemplary justice\r\nupon Ramires when taken--since Ramires obviously lay in his power for\r\nyears after the event? The answer to that you will find in the lady’s\r\nreluctance to return to Caracciolo, and the tale it tells. It is not\r\nin the least illogical to assume that, when Cesare threatened that\r\nvengeance upon Ramires for the outrage which it was alleged had been\r\ncommitted, he fully intended to execute it; but that, upon taking\r\nRamires, and upon discovering that here was no such outrage as had been\r\nrepresented, but just the elopement of a couple of lovers, he found\r\nthere was nothing for him to avenge. Was it for Cesare Borgia to set up\r\nas a protector and avenger of cuckolds? Rather would it be in keeping\r\nwith the feelings of his age and race to befriend the fugitive pair who\r\nhad planted the antlers upon the brow of the Venetian captain.\r\n\r\nLastly, Cesare’s attitude towards women may be worth considering, that\r\nwe may judge whether such an act as was imputed to him is consistent\r\nwith it. Women play no part whatever in his history. Not once shall\r\nyou find a woman’s influence swaying him; not once shall you see\r\nhim permitting dalliance to retard his advancement or jeopardize his\r\nchances. With him, as with egotists of his type, governed by cold will\r\nand cold intellect, the sentimental side of the relation of the sexes\r\nhas no place. With him one woman was as another woman; as he\r\ncraved women, so he took women, but with an almost contemptuous\r\nundiscrimination. For all his needs concerning them the lupanaria\r\nsufficed.\r\n\r\nIs this mere speculation, think you? Is there no evidence to support\r\nit, do you say? Consider, pray, in all its bearings the treatise on\r\npudendagra dedicated to a man of Cesare Borgia’s rank by the physician\r\nTorella, written to meet his needs, and see what inference you draw\r\nfrom that. Surely such an inference as will invest with the ring of\r\ntruth--expressing as it does his intimate nature, and confirming further\r\nwhat has here been said--that answer of his to the Venetian envoy, “that\r\nhe had not found the ladies of Romagna so difficult that he should be\r\ndriven to such rude and violent measures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. ASTORRE MANFREDI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 29 Cesare Borgia departed from Cesena--whither, meanwhile, he\r\nhad returned--to march upon Faenza, resume the attack, and make an end\r\nof the city’s stubborn resistance.\r\n\r\nDuring the past months, however, and notwithstanding the presence of the\r\nBorgia troops in the territory, the people of Faenza had been able to\r\nincrease their fortifications by the erection of out-works and a stout\r\nbastion in the neighbourhood of the Osservanza Hospital, well beyond the\r\nwalls. This bastion claimed Cesare’s first attention, and it was carried\r\nby assault on April 12. Thither he now fetched his guns, mounted them,\r\nand proceeded to a steady bombardment of the citadel. But the resistance\r\ncontinued with unabated determination--a determination amounting to\r\nheroism, considering the hopelessness of their case and the straits to\r\nwhich the Faentini were reduced by now. Victuals and other necessaries\r\nof life had long since been running low. Still the men of Faenza\r\ntightened their belts, looked to their defences, and flung defiance\r\nat the Borgia. The wealthier inhabitants distributed wine and flour at\r\nprices purely nominal, and lent Astorre money for the payment of his\r\ntroops. It is written that to the same end the very priests, their\r\npatriotism surmounting their duty to the Holy Father in whose name\r\nthis war was waged, consented to the despoiling of the churches and the\r\nmelting down of the sacred vessels.\r\n\r\nEven the women of Faenza bore their share of the burden of defence,\r\ncarrying to the ramparts the heavy stones that were to be hurled down\r\nupon the besiegers, or actually donning casque and body-armour and doing\r\nsentry duty on the walls while the men rested.\r\n\r\nBut the end was approaching. On April 18 the Borgia cannon opened at\r\nlast a breach in the walls, and Cesare delivered a terrible assault upon\r\nthe citadel. The fight upon the smoking ruins was fierce and determined\r\non both sides, the duke’s men pressing forward gallantly under showers\r\nof scalding pitch and a storm of boulders, launched upon them by the\r\ndefenders, who used the very ruins of the wall for ammunition. For four\r\nhours was that assault maintained; nor did it cease until the deepening\r\ndusk compelled Cesare to order the retreat, since to continue in the\r\nfailing light was but to sacrifice men to no purpose.\r\n\r\nCesare’s appreciation of the valour of the garrison ran high. It\r\ninspired him with a respect which shows his dispassionate breadth of\r\nmind, and he is reported to have declared that with an army of such men\r\nas those who held Faenza against him he would have conquered all Italy.\r\nHe did not attempt a second assault, but confined himself during the\r\nthree days that followed to continuing the bombardment.\r\n\r\nWithin Faenza men were by now in desperate case. Weariness and hunger\r\nwere so exhausting their endurance, so sapping their high valour that\r\nnightly there were desertions to the duke’s camp of men who could bear\r\nno more. The fugitives from the town were well received, all save one--a\r\nman named Grammante, a dyer by trade--who, in deserting to the duke,\r\ncame in to inform him that at a certain point of the citadel the\r\ndefences were so weak that an assault delivered there could not fail to\r\ncarry it.\r\n\r\nThis man afforded Cesare an opportunity of marking his contempt for\r\ntraitors and his respect for the gallant defenders of Faenza. The\r\nduke hanged him for his pains under the very walls of the town he had\r\nbetrayed.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st the bombardment was kept up almost without interruption for\r\neight hours, and so shattered was the citadel by that pitiless cannonade\r\nthat the end was in sight at last. But the duke’s satisfaction was\r\ntempered by his chagrin at the loss of Achille Tiberti, one of the most\r\nvaliant of his captains, and one who had followed his fortunes from the\r\nfirst with conspicuous devotion. He was killed by the bursting of a gun.\r\nA great funeral at Cesena bore witness to the extent to which Cesare\r\nesteemed and honoured him.\r\n\r\nAstorre, now seeing the citadel in ruins and the possibility of further\r\nresistance utterly exhausted, assembled the Council of Faenza to\r\ndetermine upon their course of action, and, as a result of their\r\ndeliberations, the young tyrant sent his ambassadors to the duke to\r\npropose terms of surrender. It was a belated proposal, for there was no\r\nlonger on Cesare’s part the necessity to make terms. The city’s defences\r\nwere destroyed, and to talk of surrender now was to talk of giving\r\nsomething that no longer existed. Yet Cesare met the ambassadors in a\r\nspirit of splendid generosity.\r\n\r\nThe terms proposed were that the people of Faenza should have immunity\r\nfor themselves and their property; that Astorre should have freedom to\r\ndepart and to take with him his moveable possessions, his immoveables\r\nremaining at the mercy of the Pope. By all the laws of war Cesare was\r\nentitled to a heavy indemnity for the losses he had sustained through\r\nthe resistance opposed to him. Considering those same laws and the\r\napplication they were wont to receive in his day, no one could have\r\ncensured him had he rejected all terms and given the city over to\r\npillage. Yet not only does he grant the terms submitted to him, but in\r\naddition he actually lends an ear to the Council’s prayer that out of\r\nconsideration for the great suffering of the city in the siege he should\r\nrefrain from exacting any indemnity. This was to be forbearing indeed;\r\nbut he was to carry his forbearance even further. In answer to the\r\nCouncil’s expressed fears of further harm at the hands of his troopers\r\nonce these should be in Faenza, he actually consented to effect no\r\nentrance into the town.\r\n\r\nWe are not for a moment to consider Cesare as actuated in all this by\r\nany lofty humanitarianism. He was simply pursuing that wise policy of\r\nhis, in refraining from punishing conquered States which were to\r\nbe subject henceforth to his rule, and which, therefore, must be\r\nconciliated that they might be loyal to him. But it is well that you\r\nshould at least appreciate this policy and the fruit it bore when you\r\nread that Cesare Borgia was a blood-glutted monster of carnage who\r\nravaged the Romagna, rending and devouring it like some beast of prey.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th the Council waited upon Cesare at the Hospital of the\r\nOsservanza--where he was lodged--to tender the oath of fealty. That same\r\nevening Astorre himself, attended by a few of his gentlemen, came to the\r\nduke.\r\n\r\nTo this rather sickly and melancholy lad, who had behind him a terrible\r\nfamily history of violence, and to his bastard brother, Gianevangelista,\r\nthe duke accorded the most gracious welcome. Indeed, so amiable did\r\nAstorre find the duke that, although the terms of surrender afforded\r\nhim perfect liberty to go whither he listed, he chose to accept the\r\ninvitation Cesare extended to him to remain in the duke’s train.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently probable, however, that the duke’s object in keeping the\r\nyoung man about him was prompted by another phase of that policy of\r\nhis which Macchiavelli was later to formulate into rules of conduct,\r\nexpedient in a prince:\r\n\r\n“In order to preserve a newly acquired State particular attention should\r\nbe given to two points. In the first place care should be taken entirely\r\nto extinguish the family of the ancient sovereign; in the second, laws\r\nshould not be changed, nor taxes increased.”\r\n\r\nThus Macchiavelli. The second point is all that is excellent; the first\r\nis all that is wise--cold, horrible, and revolting though it be to our\r\ntwentieth-century notions.\r\n\r\nCesare Borgia, as a matter of fact, hardly went so far as Macchiavelli\r\nadvises. He practised discrimination. He did not, for instance, seek the\r\nlives of Pandolfaccio Malatesta, or of Caterina Sforza-Riario. He saw\r\nno danger in their living, no future trouble to apprehend from them. The\r\nhatred borne them by their subjects was to Cesare a sufficient guarantee\r\nthat they would not be likely to attempt a return to their dominions,\r\nand so he permitted them to keep their lives. But to have allowed\r\nAstorre Manfredi, or even his bastard brother, to live would have been\r\nbad policy from the appallingly egotistical point of view which was\r\nCesare’s--a point of view, remember, which receives Macchiavelli’s\r\nhorribly intellectual, utterly unsentimental, revoltingly practical\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nSo--to anticipate a little--we see Cesare taking Astorre and\r\nGianevangelista Manfredi to Rome when he returned thither in the\r\nfollowing June. A fortnight later--on June 26--the formidable amazon of\r\nForli, the Countess Sforza-Riario, was liberated, as we know, from the\r\nCastle of Sant’ Angelo, and permitted to withdraw to Florence. But the\r\ngates of that grim fortress, in opening to allow her to pass out, opened\r\nalso for the purpose of admitting Astorre and Gianevangelista, upon whom\r\nthey closed.\r\n\r\nAll that is known positively of the fate of these unfortunate young men\r\nis that they never came forth again alive.\r\n\r\nThe record in Burchard (June 9, 1502) of Astorre’s body having been\r\nfound in the Tiber with a stone round his neck, suffers in probability\r\nfrom the addition that, “together with it were found the bodies of two\r\nyoung men with their arms tied, a certain woman, and many others.”\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of Giustiniani to the effect that: “It is said that\r\nthis night were thrown into Tiber and drowned the two lords of Faenza\r\ntogether with their seneschal,” was never followed up by any other\r\ndispatch confirming the rumour, nor is it confirmed by any dispatch so\r\nfar discovered from any other ambassador, nor yet does the matter find\r\nplace in the Chronicles of Faenza.\r\n\r\nBut that is of secondary importance. The ugliest feature of the case is\r\nnot the actual assassination of the young men, but the fact that Cesare\r\nhad pledged himself that Astorre should go free, and yet had kept him\r\nby him--at first, it would seem, in his train, and later as a\r\nprisoner--until he put an end to his life. It was an ugly, unscrupulous\r\ndeed; but there is no need to exaggerate its heinousness, as is\r\nconstantly done, upon no better authority than Guicciardini’s, who\r\nwrote that the murder had been committed “saziata prima la libidine di\r\nqualcuno.”\r\n\r\nOf all the unspeakable calumnies of which the Borgias have been the\r\nsubject, none is more utterly wanton than this foul exhalation of\r\nGuicciardini’s lewd invention. Let the shame that must eternally attach\r\nto him for it brand also those subsequent writers who repeated and\r\nretailed that abominable and utterly unsupported accusation, and more\r\nparticularly those who have not hesitated to assume that Guicciardini’s\r\n“qualcuno” was an old man in his seventy-second year--Pope Alexander VI.\r\n\r\nOthers a little more merciful, a little more careful of physical\r\npossibilities (but no whit less salacious) have taken it that Cesare was\r\nintended by the Florentine historian.\r\n\r\nBut, under one form or another, the lie has spread as only such foulness\r\ncan spread. It has become woven into the warp of history; it has grown\r\nto be one of those “facts” which are unquestioningly accepted, but it\r\nstands upon no better foundation than the frequent repetition which a\r\ncharge so monstrous could not escape. Its source is not a contemporary\r\none. It is first mentioned by Guicciardini; and there is no logical\r\nconclusion to be formed other than that Guicciardini invented it.\r\nAnother story which owes its existence mainly, and its particulars\r\nalmost entirely, to Guicciardini’s libellous pen--the story of the death\r\nof Alexander VI, which in its place shall be examined--provoked the\r\nrighteous anger of Voltaire. Atheist and violent anti-clerical though\r\nhe was, the story’s obvious falseness so revolted him that he penned his\r\nformidable indictment in which he branded Guicciardini as a liar who had\r\ndeceived posterity that he might vent his hatred of the Borgias. Better\r\ncause still was there in this matter of Astorre Manfredi for Voltaire’s\r\nindignation, as there is for the indignation of all conscientious\r\nseekers after truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. CASTEL BOLOGNESE AND PIOMBINO\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the surrender of Faenza on April 26, 1501, we see Cesare\r\non the morrow of that event, striking camp with such amazing suddenness\r\nthat he does not even pause to provide for the government of the\r\nconquered tyranny, but appoints a vicar four days later to attend to it.\r\n\r\nHe makes his abrupt departure from Faenza, and is off like a whirlwind\r\nto sweep unexpectedly into the Bolognese territory, and, by striking\r\nswiftly, to terrify Bentivogli into submission in the matter of Castel\r\nBolognese.\r\n\r\nThis fortress, standing in the duke’s dominions, on the road between\r\nFaenza and Imola, must be a menace to him whilst in the hands of a power\r\nthat might become actively hostile.\r\n\r\nAhead of him Cesare sent an envoy to Bentivogli, to demand its\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nThe alarmed Lord of Bologna, having convened his Council (the\r\nReggimento), replied that they must deliberate in the matter; and two\r\ndays later they dispatched their ambassador to lay before Cesare the\r\nfruits of these deliberations. They were to seek the duke at Imola; but\r\nthey got no farther than Castel S. Pietro, which to their dismay they\r\nfound already in the hands of Vitellozzo Vitelli’s men-at­arms. For,\r\nwhat time Bentivogli had been deliberating, Cesare Borgia had\r\nbeen acting with that promptness which was one of his most salient\r\ncharacteristics, and, in addition to Castel S. Pietro he had already\r\ncaptured Casalfiuminense, Castel Guelfo, and Medecina, which were now\r\ninvested by his troops.\r\n\r\nWhen the alarming news of this swift action reached Bologna it caused\r\nBentivogli to bethink him at last of Louis XII’s advice, that he should\r\ncome to terms with Cesare Borgia, and he realized that the time to do\r\nso could no longer be put off. He made haste, therefore, to agree to the\r\nsurrender of Castel Bolognese to the duke, to concede him stipend for\r\none hundred lances of three men each, and to enter into an undertaking\r\nto lend him every assistance for one year against any power with which\r\nhe might be at war, the King of France excepted. In return, Cesare\r\nwas to relinquish the captured strongholds and undertake that the Pope\r\nshould confirm Bentivogli in his ancient privileges. On April 29 Paolo\r\nOrsini went as Cesare’s plenipotentiary to Bologna to sign this treaty.\r\n\r\nIt was a crafty arrangement on Bentivogli’s part, for, over and above\r\nthe pacification of Cesare and the advantage of an alliance with him, he\r\ngained as a result the alliance also of those famous condottieri Vitelli\r\nand Orsini, both bitter enemies of Florence--the latter intent upon\r\nthe restoration of the Medici, the former impatient to avenge upon the\r\nSignory the execution of his brother Paolo. As an instalment, on account\r\nof that debt, Vitelli had already put to death Pietro da Marciano--the\r\nbrother of Count Rinuccio da Marciano--when this gentleman fell into his\r\nhands at Medicina.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the treaty was signed, Bentivogli had seized four\r\nmembers of the powerful House of Marescotti. This family was related to\r\nthe exiled Malvezzi, who were in arms with Cesare, and Bentivogli feared\r\nthat communications might be passing between the two to his undoing.\r\nOn that suspicion he kept them prisoners for the present, nor did be\r\nrelease them when the treaty was signed, nor yet when, amid public\r\nrejoicings expressing the relief of the Bolognese, it was published on\r\nMay 2.\r\n\r\nHermes Bentivogli--Giovanni’s youngest son--was on guard at the palace\r\nwith several other young Bolognese patricians, and he incited these to\r\ngo with him to make an end of the traitors who had sought to destroy the\r\npeace by their alleged plottings with Bentivogli’s enemies in Cesare’s\r\ncamp. He led his companions to the chamber where the Marescotti were\r\nconfined, and there, more or less in cold blood, those four gentlemen\r\nwere murdered for no better reason--ostensibly--than because it was\r\nsuspected they had been in communication with their relatives in the\r\nDuke of Valentinois’s army. That was the way of the Cinquecento, which\r\nappears to have held few things of less account than human life.\r\n\r\nIn passing, it may be mentioned that Guicciardini, of course, does his\r\nludicrous best to make this murder appear--at least indirectly, since\r\ndirectly it would be impossible--the work of Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nAs for Castel Bolognese itself, Cesare Borgia sent a thousand\r\ndemolishers in the following July to raze it to the ground. It is said\r\nto have been the most beautiful castle in the Romagna; but Cesare had\r\nother qualities than beauty to consider in the matter of a stronghold.\r\nIts commanding position rendered it almost in the nature of a gateway\r\ncontrolling, as we know, the road from Faenza to Imola, and its\r\noccupation by the Bolognese or other enemies in time of disturbance\r\nmight be of serious consequence to Cesare. Therefore he ruthlessly\r\nordered Ramiro de Lorqua to set about its demolition.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Castel Bolognese made great protest, and implored Ramiro\r\nto stay his hand until they should have communicated with the duke\r\npetitioning for the castle’s preservation; but Ramiro--a hard, stern\r\nman, and Cesare’s most active officer in the Romagna--told them bluntly\r\nthat to petition the duke in such a matter would be no better than a\r\nwaste of time. He was no more than right; for Cesare, being resolved\r\nupon the expediency of the castle’s destruction, would hardly be likely\r\nto listen to sentimental reasonings for its preservation. Confident of\r\nthis, Ramiro without more ado set about the execution of the orders he\r\nhad received. He pulled down the walls and filled up the moat, until\r\nnothing remained so much as to show the place where the fortress had\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nAnother fortress which shared the fate of Castel Bolognese was the\r\nCastle of Sant’ Arcangelo, and similarly would Cesare have disposed\r\nof Solarolo, but that, being of lesser importance and the inhabitants\r\noffering, in their petition for its preservation, to undertake,\r\nthemselves, the payment of the Castellan, he allowed it to remain.\r\n\r\nScarcely was the treaty with Bologna signed than Cesare received letters\r\nfrom the Pope recalling him to Rome, and recommending that he should not\r\nmolest the Florentines in his passage--a recommendation which Alexander\r\ndeemed very necessary considering the disposition towards Florence\r\nof Vitelli and Orsini. He foresaw that they would employ arguments to\r\ninduce Valentinois into an enterprise of which all the cost would be\r\nhis, and all the possible profit their own.\r\n\r\nThe duke would certainly have obeyed and avoided Tuscany, but\r\nthat--precisely as the shrewd Pope had feared--Vitelli and Orsini\r\nimplored him to march through Florentine territory. Vitelli, indeed,\r\nflung himself on his knees before Cesare in the vehemence of his\r\nsupplications, urging that his only motive was to effect the deliverance\r\nfrom his unjust imprisonment of Cerbone, who had been his executed\r\nbrother’s chancellor. Beyond that, he swore he would make no demands\r\nupon Florence, that he would not attempt to mix himself in the affairs\r\nof the Medici, and that he would do no violence to town or country.\r\n\r\nThus implored, Cesare gave way. Probably he remembered the very\r\ncircumstances under which Vitelli had joined his banner, and considered\r\nthat he could not now oppose a request backed by a promise of so much\r\nmoderation; so on May 7 he sent his envoys to the Signory to crave leave\r\nof passage for his troops through Florentine territory.\r\n\r\nWhilst still in the Bolognese he was sought out by Giuliano de’Medici,\r\nwho begged to be allowed to accompany him, a request which Cesare\r\ninstantly refused, as being contrary to that to which he had engaged\r\nhimself, and he caused Giuliano to fall behind at Lojano. Nor would he\r\nso much as receive in audience Piero de’Medici, who likewise sought to\r\njoin him in Siennese territory, as soon as he perceived what was toward.\r\nYet, however much the duke protested that he had no intention to make\r\nany change in the State of Florence, there were few who believed him.\r\nFlorence, weary and sorely reduced by the long struggle of the Pisan\r\nwar, was an easy prey. Conscious of this, great was her anxiety and\r\nalarm at Cesare’s request for passage. The Signory replied granting him\r\nthe permission sought, but imposing the condition that he should keep to\r\nthe country, refraining from entering any town, nor bring with him into\r\nFlorentine territory Vitelli, Orsini, or any other enemy of the existing\r\ngovernment. It happened, however, that when the Florentine ambassador\r\nreached him with this reply the duke was already over the frontier of\r\nTuscany with the excluded condottieri in his train.\r\n\r\nIt was incumbent upon him, as a consequence, to vindicate this\r\nhigh-handed anticipation of the unqualified Florentine permission which\r\nhad not arrived. So he declared that he had been offended last year by\r\nFlorence in the matter of Forli, and again this year in the matter of\r\nFaenza, both of which cities he charged the Signory with having assisted\r\nto resist him, and he announced that, to justify his intentions so far\r\nas Florence was concerned, he would explain himself at Barberino.\r\n\r\nThere, on May 12, he gave audience to the ambassador. He declared to him\r\nthat he desired a good understanding with Florence, and that she should\r\noffer no hindrance to the conquest of Piombino, upon which he was now\r\nbound; adding that since he placed no trust in the present government,\r\nwhich already had broken faith with him, he would require some good\r\nsecurity for the treaty to be made. Of reinstating the Medici he said\r\nnothing; but he demanded that some satisfaction be given Vitelli and\r\nOrsini, and, to quicken Florence in coming to a decision, he pushed\r\nforward with his army as far as Forno dei Campi--almost under her very\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThe Republic was thrown into consternation. Instantly she got together\r\nwhat forces she disposed of, and proceeded to fling her artillery into\r\nthe Arno, to the end that she should be constrained neither to refuse it\r\nto Cesare upon his demand, nor yet to deliver it.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli censures the Signory’s conduct of this affair as impolitic.\r\nHe contends that the duke, being in great strength of arms, and Florence\r\nnot armed at all, and therefore in no case to hinder his passage, it\r\nwould have been wiser and the Signory would better have saved its face\r\nand dignity, had it accorded Cesare the permission to pass which he\r\ndemanded, rather than have been subjected to behold him enforce that\r\npassage by weight of arms. But all that now concerned the Florentines\r\nwas to be rid of an army whose presence in their territory was a\r\nconstant menace. And to gain that end they were ready to give any\r\nundertakings, just as they were resolved to fulfil none.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it chanced that Cesare was in no less a hurry to be gone; for\r\nhe had received another letter from the Pope commanding his withdrawal,\r\nand in addition, he was being plagued by Vitelli and Orsini--grown\r\nrestive--with entreaties for permission to go into either Florence or\r\nPistoja, where they did not lack for friends. To resist them Cesare had\r\nneed of all the severity and resolution he could command; and he even\r\nwent so far as to back his refusal by a threat himself to take up arms\r\nagainst them if they insisted.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, at last, the treaty--which amounted to an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance--was signed. By the terms of this, Florence undertook\r\nto give Cesare a condotta of 300 lances for three years, to be used in\r\nFlorentine service, with a stipend of 36,000 ducats yearly. How much\r\nthis really meant the duke was to discover two days later, when he\r\nsent to ask the Signory to lend him some cannon for the emprise against\r\nPiombino, and to pay him the first instalment of one quarter of the\r\nyearly stipend before he left Florentine territory. The Signory replied\r\nthat, by the terms of the agreement, there was no obligation for\r\nthe immediate payment of the instalment, whilst in the matter of the\r\nartillery they put him off from day to day, until Cesare understood that\r\ntheir only aim in signing the treaty had been the immediate one of being\r\nrid of his army.\r\n\r\nThe risk Florence incurred in so playing fast-and-loose with such a\r\nman, particularly in a moment of such utter unfitness to resist him, is,\r\nnotwithstanding the French protection enjoyed by the Signory, amazing\r\nin its reckless audacity. It was fortunate for Florence that the Pope’s\r\norders tied the duke’s hands--and it may be that of this the Signory\r\nhad knowledge, and that it was upon such knowledge, in conjunction with\r\nFrance’s protection, that it was presuming. Cesare took the matter in\r\nthe spirit of an excellent loser.\r\n\r\nNot a hint of his chagrin and resentment did he betray; instead, he set\r\nabout furnishing his needs elsewhere, sending Vitelli to Pisa with a\r\nrequest for artillery, a request to which Pisa very readily responded,\r\nas much on Vitelli’s account as on the duke’s. As for Florence, if\r\nCesare Borgia could be terribly swift in punishing, he could also be\r\nformidably slow. If he could strike upon the instant where the opening\r\nfor a blow appeared, he could also wait for months until the opening\r\nshould be found. He waited now.\r\n\r\nIt would be at about this time that young Loenardo da Vinci sought\r\nemployment in Cesare Borgia’s service. Leonardo had been in Milan until\r\nthe summer of 1500, when he repaired to Florence in quest of better\r\nfortune; but, finding little or no work to engage him there, he took the\r\nchance of the duke of Valentinois’s passage to offer his service to one\r\nwhose liberal patronage of the arts was become proverbial. Cesare\r\ntook him into his employ as engineer and architect, leaving him in the\r\nRomagna for the present. Leonardo may have superintended the repairs of\r\nthe Castle of Forli, whilst he certainly built the canal from Cesena to\r\nthe Porto Cesenatico, before rejoining the duke in Rome.\r\n\r\nOn May 25 Cesare moved by the way of the valley of Cecina to try\r\nconclusions with Giacomo d’Appiano, Tyrant of Piombino, who with some\r\nGenoese and some Florentine aid, was disposed to offer resistance to the\r\nduke. The first strategic movement in this affair must be the capture\r\nof the Isle of Elba, whence aid might reach Piombino on its promontory\r\nthrusting out into the sea. For this purpose the Pope sent from Civita\r\nVecchia six galleys, three brigantines, and two galleons under the\r\ncommand of Lodovico Mosca, captain of the papal navy, whilst Cesare\r\nwas further reinforced by some vessels sent him from Pisa together with\r\neight pieces of cannon. With these he made an easy capture of Elba and\r\nPianosa. That done, he proceeded to lay siege to Piombino, which, after\r\nmaking a gallant resistance enduring for two months, was finally pressed\r\nto capitulate.\r\n\r\nLong before that happened, however, Cesare had taken his departure.\r\nBeing awaited in Rome, he was unable to conduct the siege operations\r\nin person. So he quitted Piombino in June to join the French under\r\nd’Aubigny, bound at last upon the conquest of Naples, and claiming--as\r\ntheir treaty with him provided--Cesare’s collaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE END OF THE HOUSE OF ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nCesare arrived in Rome on June 13. There was none of the usual pomp on\r\nthis occasion. He made his entrance quietly, attended only by a small\r\nbody of men-at-arms, and he was followed, on the morrow, by Yves\r\nd’Allègre with the army--considerably reduced by the detachments which\r\nhad been left to garrison the Romagna, and to lay siege to Piombino.\r\n\r\nRepairing to his quarters in the Vatican, the duke remained so close\r\nthere for the few weeks that he abode in Rome on this occasion(1) that,\r\nfrom now onward, it became a matter of the utmost difficulty to obtain\r\naudience from him. This may have been due to his habit of turning night\r\ninto day and day into night, whether at work or at play, which in fact\r\nwas the excuse offered by the Pope to certain envoys sent to Cesare\r\nfrom Rimini, who were left to cool their heels about the Vatican\r\nante-chambers for a fortnight without succeeding in obtaining an\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 “Mansit in Palatio secrete,” says Burchard.\r\n\r\n\r\nCesare Borgia was now Lord of Imola, Forli, Rimini, Faenza and Piombino,\r\nwarranting his assumption of the inclusive title of Duke of Romagna\r\nwhich he had taken immediately after the fall of Faenza.\r\n\r\nAs his State grew, so naturally did the affairs of government; and,\r\nduring those four weeks in Rome, business claimed his attention and an\r\nenormous amount of it was dispatched. Chiefly was he engaged upon the\r\nadministration of the affairs of Faenza, which he had so hurriedly\r\nquitted. In this his shrewd policy of generosity is again apparent. As\r\nhis representative and lieutenant he appointed a prominent citizen of\r\nFaenza named Pasi, one of the very members of that Council which had\r\nbeen engaged in defending the city and resisting Cesare. The duke gave\r\nit as his motive for the choice that the man was obviously worthy of\r\ntrust in view of his fidelity to Astorre.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have not only the shrewdness of the man who knows how\r\nto choose his servants--which is one of the most important factors of\r\nsuccess--but a breadth of mind very unusual indeed in the Cinquecento.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the immunity from indemnity provided for by the terms\r\nof the city’s capitulation, Cesare actually went so far as to grant the\r\npeasantry of the valley 2,000 ducats as compensation for damage done in\r\nthe war. Further, he supported the intercessions of the Council to the\r\nPope for the erection of a new convent to replace the one that had been\r\ndestroyed in the bombardment. In giving his consent to this--in a brief\r\ndated July 12, 1501--the Pope announces that he does so in response to\r\nthe prayers of the Council and of the duke.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Vera, Cesare’s erstwhile preceptor--and still affectionately\r\naccorded this title by the duke--was now Archbiship of Salerno, Cardinal\r\nof Santa Balbina, and papal legate in Macerata, and he was chosen by the\r\nPope to go to Pesaro and Fano for the purpose of receiving the oath of\r\nfealty. With him Cesare sent, as his own personal representative, his\r\nsecretary, Agabito Gherardi, who had been in his employ in that capacity\r\nsince the duke’s journey into France, and who was to follow his fortunes\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nHowever the people of Fano may have refrained from offering themselves\r\nto the duke’s dominion when, in the previous October, he had afforded\r\nthem by his presence the opportunity of doing so, their conduct\r\nnow hardly indicated that the earlier abstention had been born of\r\nreluctance, or else their minds had undergone, in the meanwhile, a\r\nconsiderable change. For, when they received the brief appointing\r\nhim their lord, they celebrated the event by public rejoicings and\r\nilluminations; whilst on July 21 the Council, representing the people,\r\nin the presence of Vera and Gherardi, took oath upon the Gospels of\r\nallegiance to Cesare and his descendants for ever.\r\n\r\nIn the Consistory of June 25 of that year the French and Spanish\r\nambassadors came formally to notify the Holy Father of the treaty of\r\nGranada, entered into in the previous November by Louis XII of the one\r\npart, and Ferdinand and Isabella of the other, concerning the conquest\r\nand division of the Kingdom of Naples. The rival claimants had come to\r\na compromise by virtue of which they were to undertake together the\r\nconquest and thereafter share the spoil--Naples and the Abruzzi going to\r\nFrance, and Calabria and Puglia to Spain.\r\n\r\nAlexander immediately published his Bull declaring Federigo of Naples\r\ndeposed for disobedience to the Church, and for having called the Turk\r\nto his aid, either of which charges it would have taxed Alexander’s\r\ningenuity--vast though it was--convincingly to have established; or,\r\nbeing established, to censure when all the facts were considered.\r\nThe charges were no better than pretexts for the spoliation of the\r\nunfortunate king who, in the matter of his daughter’s alliance with\r\nCesare, had conceived that he might flout the Borgias with impunity.\r\n\r\nOn June 28 d’Aubigny left Rome with the French troops, accompanied by\r\nthe bulk of the considerable army with which Cesare supported his French\r\nally, besides 1,000 foot raised by the Pope and a condotta of 100 lances\r\nunder Morgante Baglioni. As the troops defiled before the Castle of\r\nSant’ Angelo they received the apostolic benediction from the Pope, who\r\nstood on the lower ramparts of the fortress.\r\n\r\nCesare himself cannot have followed to join the army until after July\r\n10, for as late as that date there is an edict indited by him against\r\nall who should offer injury to his Romagna officers. At about the same\r\ntime that he quitted Rome to ride after the French, Gonsalo de Cordoba\r\nlanded a Spanish army in Calabria, and the days of the Aragon dominion\r\nin Naples were numbered.\r\n\r\nKing Federigo prepared to face the foe. Whilst himself remaining in\r\nNaples with Prospero Colonna, he sent the bulk of his forces to Capua\r\nunder Fabrizio Colonna and Count Rinuccio Marciano--the brother of that\r\nMarciano whom Vitelli had put to death in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nRavaging the territory and forcing its strongholds as they came, the\r\nallies were under the walls of Capua within three weeks of setting out;\r\nbut on July 17, when within two miles of the town, they were met by six\r\nhundred lances under Colonna, who attempted to dispute their passage.\r\nIt was Cesare Borgia himself who led the charge against them. Jean\r\nd’Auton--in his Chronicles of Louis XII--speaks in warm terms of the\r\nduke’s valour and of the manner in which, by words and by example, he\r\nencouraged his followers to charge the Colonna forces, with such good\r\neffect that they utterly routed the Neapolitans, and drove them headlong\r\nback to the shelter of Capua’s walls.\r\n\r\nThe allies brought up their cannon, and opened the bombardment. This\r\nlasted incessantly from July 17--which was a Monday--until the following\r\nFriday, when two bastions were so shattered that the French were able\r\nto gain possession of them, putting to the sword some two hundred\r\nNeapolitan soldiers who had been left to defend those outworks. Thence\r\nadmittance to the town itself was gained four days later--on the\r\n25th--through a breach, according to some, through the treacherous\r\nopening of a gate, according to others. Through gate or breach the\r\nbesiegers stormed to meet a fierce resistance, and the most horrible\r\ncarnage followed. Back and back they drove the defenders, fighting their\r\nway through the streets and sparing none in the awful fury that beset\r\nthem. The defence was shattered; resistance was at an end; yet still\r\nthe bloody work went on. The combat had imperceptibly merged into a\r\nslaughter; demoralized and panic-stricken in the reaction from their\r\nlate gallantry, the soldiers of Naples flung down their weapons and\r\nfled, shrieking for quarter. But none was given. The invader butchered\r\nevery human thing he came upon, indiscriminant of age or sex, and the\r\nblood of some four thousand victims flowed through the streets of Capua\r\nlike water after a thundershower. That sack of Capua is one of the most\r\nhorrid pages in the horrid history of sacks. You will find full details\r\nin d’Auton’s chronicle, if you have a mind for such horrors. There is\r\na brief summary of the event in Burchard’s diary under date of July 26,\r\n1501, which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“At about the fourth hour last night the Pope had news of the capture of\r\nCapua by the Duke of Valentinois. The capture was due to the treason of\r\none Fabrizio--a citizen of Capua--who secretly introduced the besiegers\r\nand was the first to be killed by them. After him the same fate was\r\nmet by some three thousand foot and some two hundred horse-soldiers, by\r\ncitizens, priests, conventuals of both sexes, even in the very churches\r\nand monasteries, and all the women taken were given in prey to the\r\ngreatest cruelty. The total number of the slain is estimated at four\r\nthousand.”\r\n\r\nD’Auton, too, bears witness to this wholesale violation of the women,\r\n“which,” he adds, “is the very worst of all war’s excesses.” He informs\r\nus further that “the foot-soldiers of the Duke of Valentinois acquitted\r\nthemselves so well in this, that thirty of the most beautiful women went\r\ncaptive to Rome,” a figure which is confirmed by Burchard.\r\n\r\n“What an opportunity was not this for Guicciardini! The foot-soldiers\r\nof the Duke of Valentinois acquitted themselves so well in this, that\r\nthirty of the most beautiful women went captive to Rome.”\r\n\r\nUnder his nimble, malicious, unscrupulous pen that statement is\r\nre-edited until not thirty but forty is the number of the captured\r\nvictims taken to Rome, and not Valentinois’s foot, but Valentinois\r\nhimself the ravisher of the entire forty! But hear the elegant\r\nFlorentine’s own words:\r\n\r\n“It was spread about [divulgossi]” he writes, “that, besides other\r\nwickednesses worthy of eternal infamy, many women who had taken refuge\r\nin a tower, and thus escaped the first fury of the assault, were found\r\nby the Duke of Valentinois, who, with the title of King’s Lieutenant,\r\nfollowed the army with no more people than his gentlemen and his\r\nguards.(1) He desired to see them all, and, after carefully examining\r\nthem [consideratele diligentemente] he retained forty of the most\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  This, incidentally, is another misstatement.  Valentinois had with\r\nhim, besides the thousand foot levied by the Pope and the hundred lances\r\nunder Morgante Baglioni, an army some thousands strong led for him by\r\nYves d’Allègre.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuicciardini’s aim is, of course, to shock you; he considers it\r\nnecessary to maintain in Cesare the character of ravenous wolf which he\r\nhad bestowed upon him. The marvel is not that Guicciardini should have\r\npenned that utterly ludicrous accusation, but that more or less serious\r\nsubsequent writers--and writers of our own time even--instead of being\r\nmoved to contemptuous laughter at the wild foolishness of the story,\r\ninstead of seeking in the available records the germ of true fact from\r\nwhich it was sprung, should sedulously and unblushingly have carried\r\nforward its dissemination.\r\n\r\nYriarte not only repeats the tale with all the sober calm of one utterly\r\ndestitute of a sense of the ridiculous, but he improves upon it by a\r\ndelicious touch, worthy of Guicciardini himself, when he assures us that\r\nCesare took these forty women for his harem!\r\n\r\nIt is a nice instance of how Borgia history has grown, and is still\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nIf verisimilitude itself does not repudiate Guicciardini’s story, there\r\nare the Capuan chronicles to do it--particularly that of Pellegrini, who\r\nwitnessed the pillage. In those chronicles from which Guicciardini drew\r\nthe matter for this portion of his history of Italy, you will seek in\r\nvain for any confirmation of that fiction with which the Florentine\r\nhistorian--he who had a pen of gold for his friends and one of iron for\r\nhis foes--thought well to adorn his facts.\r\n\r\nIf the grotesque in history-building is of interest to you, you may turn\r\nthe pages of the Storia Civile di Capua, by F. Granata, published in\r\n1752. This writer has carefully followed the Capuan chroniclers in their\r\nrelation of the siege; but when it comes to these details of the forty\r\nladies in the tower (in which those chroniclers fail him) he actually\r\ngives Guicciardini as his authority, setting a fashion which has not\r\nlacked for unconscious, and no less egregious, imitators.\r\n\r\nTo return from the criticism of fiction to the consideration of fact,\r\nFabrizio Colonna and Rinuccio da Marciano were among the many captains\r\nof the Neapolitan army that were taken prisoners. Rinuccio was the\r\nhead of the Florentine faction which had caused the execution of Paolo\r\nVitelli, and Giovio has it that Vitellozzo Vitelli, who had already\r\ntaken an instalment of vengeance by putting Pietro da Marciano to death\r\nin Tuscany, caused Rinuccio’s wounds to be poisoned, so that he died two\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Capua was very shortly followed by that of Gaeta, and,\r\nwithin a week, by that of Naples, which was entered on August 3 by\r\nCesare Borgia in command of the vanguard of the army. “He who had come\r\nas a cardinal to crown King Federigo, came now as a condottiero to\r\ndepose him.”\r\n\r\nFederigo offered to surrender to the French all the fortresses that\r\nstill held for him, on condition that he should have safe-conduct to\r\nIschia and liberty to remain there for six months. This was agreed, and\r\nFederigo was further permitted to take with him his moveable possessions\r\nand his artillery, which latter, however, he afterwards sold to the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nThus the last member of the House of Aragon to sit upon the throne of\r\nNaples took his departure, accompanied by the few faithful ones who\r\nloved him well enough to follow him into exile; amongst these was that\r\npoet Sanazzaro, who, to avenge the wrong suffered by the master whom he\r\nloved, was to launch his terrible epigrams against Alexander, Cesare,\r\nand Lucrezia, and by means of those surviving verses enable the enemies\r\nof the House of Borgia to vilify their memories through centuries to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nFederigo’s captains Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna, upon being ransomed,\r\ntook their swords to Gonzalo de Cordoba, hoping for the day when they\r\nmight avenge upon the Borgia the ruin which, even in this Neapolitan\r\nconquest they attributed to the Pope and his son.\r\n\r\nAnd here, so far as Naples is concerned, closes the history of the House\r\nof Aragon. In Italy it was extinct; and it was to become so, too, in\r\nSpain within the century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. THE LETTER TO SILVIO SAVELLI\r\n\r\n\r\nBy September 15 Cesare was back in Rome, the richer in renown, in French\r\nfavour, and in a matter of 40,000 ducats, which is estimated as the\r\ntotal of the sums paid him by France and Spain for the support which his\r\ncondotta had afforded them.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence two important events had taken place: the betrothal\r\nof his widowed sister Lucrezia to Alfonso d’Este, son of Duke Ercole of\r\nFerrara, and the publication of the Bull of excommunication (of August\r\n20) against the Savelli and Colonna in consideration of all that they\r\nhad wrought against the Holy See from the pontificate of Sixtus IV\r\nto the present time. By virtue of that Bull the Pope ordered the\r\nconfiscation of the possessions of the excommunicated families, whilst\r\nthe Caetani suffered in like manner at the same time.\r\n\r\nThese possessions were divided into two parts, and by the Bull of\r\nSeptember 17 they were bestowed, one upon Lucrezia’s boy Roderigo, and\r\nwith them the title of Duke of Sermoneta; the other to a child, Giovanni\r\nBorgia (who is made something of a mystery) with the title of Duke of\r\nNepi and Palestrina.\r\n\r\nThe entire proceeding is undoubtedly open to grave censure, since the\r\ndistribution of the confiscated fiefs subjects to impeachment the purity\r\nof the motives that prompted this confiscation. It was on the part\r\nof Alexander a gross act of nepotism, a gross abuse of his pontifical\r\nauthority; but there is, at least, this to be said, that in perpetrating\r\nit he was doing no more than in his epoch it was customary for Popes to\r\ndo. Alexander, it may be said again in this connection, was part of a\r\ncorrupt system, not the corrupter of a pure one.\r\n\r\nTouching the boy Giovanni Borgia, the mystery attaching to him concerns\r\nhis parentage, and arises out of the singular circumstance that there\r\nare two papal Bulls, both dated September 1, 1501, in each of which a\r\ndifferent father is assigned to him, the second appearing to supplement\r\nand correct the first.\r\n\r\nThe first of these Bulls, addressed to “Dilecto Filio Nobili Joanni de\r\nBorgia, Infanti Romano,” declares him to be a child of three years of\r\nage, the illegitimate son of Cesare Borgia, unmarried (as Cesare was at\r\nthe time of the child’s birth) and of a woman (unnamed, as was usual in\r\nsuch cases) also unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe second declares him, instead, to be the son of Alexander, and runs:\r\n“Since you bear this deficiency not from the said duke, but from us and\r\nthe said woman, which we for good reasons did not desire to express in\r\nthe preceding writing.”\r\n\r\nThat the second Bull undoubtedly contains the truth of the matter is the\r\nonly possible explanation of its existence, and the “good reasons”\r\n that existed for the first one are, no doubt, as Gregorovius says, that\r\nofficially and by canon law the Pope was inhibited from recognizing\r\nchildren. (His other children, be it remembered, were recognized by him\r\nduring his cardinalate and before his elevation to St. Peter’s throne.)\r\nHence the attempt by these Bulls to circumvent the law to the end that\r\nthe child should not suffer in the matter of his inheritance.\r\n\r\nBurchard, under date of November 3 of that year, freely mentions this\r\nGiovanni Borgia as the son of the Pope and “a certain Roman woman”\r\n (“quadam Romana”).\r\n\r\nOn the same date borne by those two Bulls a third one was issued\r\nconfirming the House of Este perpetually in the dominion of Ferrara and\r\nits other Romagna possessions, and reducing by one-third the tribute of\r\n4,000 ducats yearly imposed upon that family by Sixtus IV; and it was\r\nexplicitly added that these concessions were made for Lucrezia and her\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nThree days later a courier from Duke Ercole brought the news that the\r\nmarriage contract had been signed in Ferrara, and it was in salvoes\r\nof artillery that day and illuminations after dark that the Pope gave\r\nexpression to the satisfaction afforded him by the prospect of his\r\ndaughter’s entering one of the most ancient families and ascending one\r\nof the noblest thrones in Italy.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to pretend that the marriage was other than one of\r\nconvenience. Love between the contracting parties played no part in this\r\ntransaction, and Ercole d’Este was urged to it under suasion of the\r\nKing of France, out of fear of the growing might of Cesare, and out of\r\nconsideration for the splendid dowry which he demanded and in the matter\r\nof which he displayed a spirit which Alexander contemptuously described\r\nas that of a tradesman. Nor would Ercole send the escort to Rome for the\r\nbride until he had in his hands the Bull of investiture in the fiefs\r\nof Cento and Pieve, which, with 100,000 ducats, constituted Lucrezia’s\r\ndowry. Altogether a most unromantic affair.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the Ferrarese ambassador in Rome, dated\r\nSeptember 23, is of interest in connection with this marriage:\r\n\r\n\r\n“MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE AND MOST NOBLE LORD,\r\n\r\n“His Holiness the Pope, taking into consideration such matters as\r\nmight occasion displeasure not only to your Excellency and to the Most\r\nIllustrious Don Alfonso, but also to the duchess and even to himself,\r\nhas charged us to write to your Excellency to urge you so to contrive\r\nthat the Lord Giovanni of Pesaro, who, as your Excellency is aware,\r\nis in Mantua, shall not be in Ferrara at the time of the nuptials.\r\nNotwithstanding that his divorce from the said duchess is absolutely\r\nlegitimate and accomplished in accordance with pure truth, as is\r\npublicly known not only from the proceedings of the trial but also from\r\nthe free confession of the said Don Giovanni, it is possible that he may\r\nstill be actuated by some lingering ill-will; wherefore, should he\r\nfind himself in any place where the said lady might be seen by him, her\r\nExcellency might, in consequence, be compelled to withdraw into privacy,\r\nto be spared the memory of the past. Wherefore, his Holiness exhorts\r\nyour Excellency to provide with your habitual prudence against such a\r\ncontingency.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the festivities wherewith her betrothal was celebrated went\r\nmerrily amain, and into the midst of them, to bear his share, came\r\nCesare crowned with fresh laurels gained in the Neapolitan war. No\r\nmerry-makings ever held under the auspices of Pope Alexander VI at the\r\nVatican had escaped being the source of much scandalous rumour, but none\r\nhad been so scandalous and disgraceful as the stories put abroad on\r\nthis occasion. These found a fitting climax in that anonymous Letter to\r\nSilvio Savelli, published in Germany--which at the time, be it borne in\r\nmind, was extremely inimical to the Pope, viewing with jaundiced eyes\r\nhis ever-growing power, and stirred perhaps to this unspeakable burst of\r\nvenomous fury by the noble Este alliance, so valuable to Cesare in that\r\nit gave him a friend upon the frontier of his Romagna possessions.\r\n\r\nThe appalling publication, which is given in full in Burchard, was\r\nfictitiously dated from Gonzola de Cordoba’s Spanish camp at Taranto\r\non November 25. A copy of this anonymous pamphlet, which is the most\r\nviolent attack on the Borgias ever penned, perhaps the most terrible\r\nindictment against any family ever published--a pamphlet which\r\nGregorovius does not hesitate to call “an authentic document of the\r\nstate of Rome under the Borgias”--fell into the hands of the Cardinal of\r\nModena, who on the last day of the year carried it to the Pope.\r\n\r\nBefore considering that letter it is well to turn to the entries in\r\nBurchard’s diary under the dates of October 27 and November 11 of that\r\nsame year. You will find two statements which have no parallel in the\r\nrest of the entire diary, few parallels in any sober narrative of facts.\r\nThe sane mind must recoil and close up before them, so impossible does\r\nit seem to accept them.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the relation of the supper given by Cesare in the\r\nVatican to fifty courtesans--a relation which possibly suggested to\r\nthe debauched Regent d’Orléans his fêtes d’Adam, a couple of centuries\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nBurchard tells us how, for the amusement of Cesare, of the Pope, and of\r\nLucrezia, these fifty courtesans were set to dance after supper with\r\nthe servants and some others who were present, dressed at first and\r\nafterwards not so. He draws for us a picture of those fifty women on all\r\nfours, in all their plastic nudity, striving for the chestnuts flung to\r\nthem in that chamber of the Apostolic Palace by Christ’s Vicar--an old\r\nman of seventy--by his son and his daughter. Nor is that all by\r\nany means. There is much worse to follow--matter which we dare not\r\ntranslate, but must leave more or less discreetly veiled in the decadent\r\nLatin of the Caerimoniarius:\r\n\r\n“Tandem exposita dona ultima, diploides de serico, paria caligarum,\r\nbireta ed alia pro illis qui pluries dictas meretrices carnaliter\r\nagnoscerent; que fuerunt ibidem in aula publice carnaliter tractate\r\narbitrio presentium, dona distributa victoribus.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the monstrous story!\r\n\r\nGregorovius, in his defence of Lucrezia Borgia, refuses to believe\r\nthat she was present; but he is reluctant to carry his incredulity any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n“Some orgy of that nature,” he writes, “or something similar may very\r\nwell have taken place. But who will believe that Lucrezia, already the\r\nlegal wife of Alfonso d’Este and on the eve of departure for Ferrara,\r\ncan have been present as a smiling spectator?”\r\n\r\nQuite so. Gregorovius puts his finger at once upon one of the obvious\r\nweaknesses of the story. But where there is one falsehood there are\r\nusually others; and if we are not to believe that Lucrezia was present,\r\nwhy should we be asked to believe in the presence of the Pope? If\r\nBurchard was mistaken in the one, why might he not be mistaken in the\r\nother? But the question is not really one of whom you will believe to\r\nhave been present at that unspeakable performance, but rather whether\r\nyou can possibly bring yourself to believe that it ever took place as it\r\nis related in the Diarium.\r\n\r\nGregorovius says, you will observe, “Some orgy of that nature, or\r\nsomething similar, may very well have taken place.” We could credit\r\nthat Cesare held “some orgy of that nature.” He had apartments in the\r\nVatican, and if it shock you to think that it pleased him, with his\r\ngentlemen, to make merry by feasting a parcel of Roman harlots, you\r\nare--if you value justice--to be shocked at the times rather than\r\nthe man. The sense of humour of the Cinquecento was primitive, and\r\nin primitive humour prurience plays ever an important part, as is\r\ndiscernible in the literature and comedies of that age. If you would\r\nappreciate this to the full, consider Burchard’s details of the masks\r\nworn at Carnival by some merry-makers (“Venerunt ad plateam St. Petri\r\nlarvati...habentes nasos lungos et grossos in forma priaporum”) and you\r\nmust realize that in Cesare’s conduct in this matter there would have\r\nbeen nothing so very abnormal considered from the point of view of\r\nthe Cinquecento, even though it were to approach the details given by\r\nBurchard.\r\n\r\nBut even so, you will hesitate before you accept the story of that\r\nsaturnalia in its entirety, and before you believe that an old man of\r\nseventy, a priest and Christ’s Vicar, was present with Cesare and his\r\nfriends. Burchard does not say that he himself was a witness of what he\r\nrelates. But the matter shall presently be further considered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, let us pass to the second of these entries in the diary, and\r\n(a not unimportant detail) on the very next page of it, under the date\r\nof November 11. In this it is related that certain peasants entered Rome\r\nby the Viridarian Gate, driving two mares laden with timber; that, in\r\ncrossing the Square of St. Peter’s, some servants of the Pope’s ran\r\nout and cut the cords so that the timber was loosened and the beasts\r\nrelieved of their burden; they were then led to a courtyard within the\r\nprecincts of the palace, where four stallions were loosed upon them.\r\n“Ascenderunt equas et coierunt cum eis et eas graviter pistarunt et\r\nleserunt,” whilst the Pope at a window above the doorway of the Palace,\r\nwith Madonna Lucrezia, witnessed with great laughter and delight, the\r\nshow which it is suggested was specially provided for their amusement.\r\n\r\nThe improbabilities of the saturnalia of the fifty courtesans pale\r\nbefore the almost utter impossibility of this narrative. To render it\r\npossible in the case of two chance animals as these must have been\r\nunder the related circumstances, a biological coincidence is demanded so\r\nutterly unlikely and incredible that we are at once moved to treat the\r\nstory with scorn, and reject it as a fiction. Yet not one of those many\r\nwriters who have retailed that story from Burchard’s Diarium as a truth\r\nincontestable as the Gospels, has paused to consider this--so blinded\r\nare we when it is a case of accepting that which we desire to accept.\r\n\r\nThe narrative, too, is oddly--suspiciously--circumstantial, even to the\r\nunimportant detail of the particular gate by which the peasants entered\r\nRome. In a piece of fiction it is perfectly natural to fill in such\r\nminor details to the end that the picture shall be complete; but they\r\nare rare in narratives of fact. And one may be permitted to wonder how\r\ncame the Master of Ceremonies at the Vatican to know the precise gate by\r\nwhich those peasants came. It is not--as we have seen--the only occasion\r\non which an excess of detail in the matter of a gate renders suspicious\r\nthe accuracy of a story of Burchard’s.\r\n\r\nBoth these affairs find a prominent place in the Letter to Silvio\r\nSavelli. Indeed Gregorovius cites the pamphlet as one of the authorities\r\nto support Burchard, and to show that what Burchard wrote must have been\r\ntrue; the other authority he cites is Matarazzo, disregarding not only\r\nthe remarkable discrepancy between Matarazzo’s relation and that of\r\nBurchard, but the circumstance that the matter of that pamphlet became\r\ncurrent throughout Italy, and that it was thus--and only thus--that\r\nMatarazzo came to hear of the scandal.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The frequency with which the German historian cites Matarazzo as an\r\nauthority is oddly inconsistent, considering that when he finds\r\nMatarazzo’s story of the murder of the Duke of Gandia upsetting the\r\ntheory which Gregorovius himself prefers, by fastening the guilt\r\nupon Giovanni Sforza, he devotes some space to showing--with perfect\r\njustice--that Matarazzo is no authority at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Letter to Silvio Savelli opens by congratulating him upon his escape\r\nfrom the hands of the robbers who had stripped him of his possessions,\r\nand upon his having found a refuge in Germany at the Emperor’s Court.\r\nIt proceeds to marvel that thence he should have written letters to\r\nthe Pope begging for justice and reinstatement, his wonder being at the\r\ncredulity of Savelli in supposing that the Pope--“betrayer of the human\r\nrace, who has spent his life in betrayals”--will ever do any just thing\r\nother than through fear or force. Rather does the writer suggest the\r\nadoption of other methods; he urges Savelli to make known to the Emperor\r\nand all princes of the Empire the atrocious crimes of that “infamous\r\nwild beasts” which have been perpetrated in contempt of God and\r\nreligion. He then proceeds to relate these crimes. Alexander, Cesare,\r\nand Lucrezia, among others of the Borgia family, bear their share of the\r\nformidable accusations. Of the Pope are related perfidies, simonies, and\r\nravishments; against Lucrezia are urged the matter of her incest, the\r\nsupper of the fifty courtesans, and the scene of the stallions; against\r\nCesare there are the death of Biselli, the murder of Pedro Caldes, the\r\nruin of the Romagna, whence he has driven out the legitimate lords, and\r\nthe universal fear in which he is held.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a compendium of all the stories which from Milan, Naples,\r\nand Venice--the three States where the Borgias for obvious reasons are\r\nbest hated--have been disseminated by their enemies, and a more violent\r\nwork of rage and political malice was never uttered. This malice becomes\r\nparticularly evident in the indictment of Cesare for the ruin of the\r\nRomagna. Whatever Cesare might have done, he had not done that--his\r\nbitterest detractor could not (without deliberately lying) say that the\r\nRomagna was other than benefiting under his sway. That is not a matter\r\nof opinion, not a matter of inference or deduction. It is a matter of\r\nabsolute fact and irrefutable knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo return now to the two entries in Burchard’s Diarium when considered\r\nin conjunction with the Letter to Silvio Savelli (which Burchard quotes\r\nin full), it is remarkable that nowhere else in the discovered writings\r\nof absolute contemporaries is there the least mention of either of those\r\nscandalous stories. The affair of the stallions, for instance, must have\r\nbeen of a fairly public character. Scandal-mongering Rome could not have\r\nresisted the dissemination of it. Yet, apart from the Savelli letter, no\r\nsingle record of it has been discovered to confirm Burchard.\r\n\r\nAt this time, moreover, it is to be remembered, Lucrezia’s betrothal to\r\nAlfonso d’Este was already accomplished; preparations for her departure\r\nand wedding were going forward, and the escort from Ferrara was daily\r\nexpected in Rome. If Lucrezia had never been circumspect, she must be\r\ncircumspect now, when the eyes of Italy were upon her, and there\r\nwere not wanting those who would have been glad to have thwarted the\r\nmarriage--the object, no doubt, of the pamphlet we are considering. Yet\r\nall that was written to Ferrara was in praise of her--in praise of\r\nher goodness and her modesty, her prudence, her devoutness, and her\r\ndiscretion, as presently we shall see.\r\n\r\nIf from this we are to conclude--as seems reasonable--that there was no\r\ngossip current in Rome of the courtesans’ supper and the rest, we may\r\nassume that there was no knowledge in Rome of such matters; for with\r\nknowledge silence would have been impossible. So much being admitted,\r\nit becomes a matter of determining whether the author of the Letter to\r\nSilvio Savelli had access to the diary of Burchard for his facts, or\r\nwhether Burchard availed himself of the Letter to Silvio Savelli to\r\ncompile these particular entries. The former alternative being out of\r\nthe question, there but remains the latter--unless it is possible that\r\nthe said entries have crept into the copies of the “Diarium” and are not\r\npresent in the original, which is not available.\r\n\r\nThis theory of interpolation, tentatively put forward, is justified, to\r\nsome extent at least, by the following remarkable circumstances: that\r\ntwo such entries, having--as we have said--absolutely no parallel in the\r\nwhole of the Diarium, should follow almost immediately the one upon the\r\nother; and that Burchard should relate them coldly, without reproof or\r\ncomment of any kind--a most unnatural reticence in a writer who loosed\r\nhis indignation one Easter-tide to see Lucrezia and her ladies occupying\r\nthe choir of St. Peter’s, where women never sat.\r\n\r\nThe Pope read the anonymous libel when it was submitted to him by the\r\nCardinal of Modena--read it, laughed it to scorn, and treated it with\r\nthe contempt which it deserved, yet a contempt which, considering its\r\nnature, asks a certain greatness of mind.\r\n\r\nIf the libel was true it is almost incredible that he should not have\r\nsought to avenge it, for an ugly truth is notoriously hurtful and\r\nprovocative of resentment, far more so than is a lie. Cesare, however,\r\nwas not of a temper quite as long-suffering as his father. Enough and\r\nmore of libels and lampoons had he endured already. Early in December\r\na masked man--a Neapolitan of the name of Mancioni--who had been going\r\nthrough Rome uttering infamies against him was seized and so dealt with\r\nthat he should in future neither speak nor write anything in any man’s\r\ndefamation. His tongue was cut out and his right hand chopped off, and\r\nthe hand, with the tongue attached to its little finger, was hung in\r\nsight of all and as a warning from a window of the Church of Holy Cross.\r\n\r\nAnd towards the end of January, whilst Cesare’s fury at that pamphlet\r\nout of Germany was still unappeased, a Venetian was seized in Rome for\r\nhaving translated from Greek into Latin another libel against the Pope\r\nand his son. The Venetian ambassador intervened to save the wretch, but\r\nhis intervention was vain. The libeller was executed that same night.\r\n\r\nCostabili--the Ferrara ambassador--who spoke to the Pope on the matter\r\nof this execution, reported that his Holiness said that more than once\r\nhad he told the duke that Rome was a free city, in which any one was at\r\nliberty to say or write what he pleased; that of himself, too, much evil\r\nwas being spoken, but that he paid no heed to it.\r\n\r\n“The duke,” proceeded Alexander, “is good-natured, but he has not\r\nyet learnt to bear insult.” And he added that, irritated, Cesare had\r\nprotested that, “However much Rome may be in the habit of speaking and\r\nwriting, for my own part I shall give these libellers a lesson in good\r\nmanners.”\r\n\r\nThe lesson he intended was not one they should live to practise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. LUCREZIA’S THIRD MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about the same time that Burchard was making in his Diarium those\r\nentries which reflect so grossly upon the Pope and Lucrezia, Gianluca\r\nPozzi, the ambassador of Ferrara at the Vatican, was writing the\r\nfollowing letter to his master, Duke Ercole, Lucrezia’s father-in-law\r\nelect:\r\n\r\n“This evening, after supper, I accompanied Messer Gerardo Saraceni to\r\nvisit the Most Illustrious Madonna Lucrezia in your Excellency’s name\r\nand that of the Most Illustrious Don Alfonso. We entered into a long\r\ndiscussion touching various matters. In truth she showed herself a\r\nprudent, discreet, and good-natured lady.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  See Gregorovius’s Lucrezia Borgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe handsome, athletic Cardinal Ippolito d’Este, with his brothers\r\nSigismondo and Fernando, had arrived in Rome on December 23 with the\r\nimposing escort that was to accompany their brother Alfonso’s bride back\r\nto Ferrara.\r\n\r\nCesare was prominent in the welcome given them. Never, perhaps, had he\r\nmade greater display than on the occasion of his riding out to meet the\r\nFerrarese, accompanied by no fewer than 4,000 men-at-arms, and mounted\r\non a great war-horse whose trappings of cloth of gold and jewels were\r\nestimated at 10,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nThe days and nights that followed, until Lucrezia’s departure a\r\nfortnight later, were days and nights of gaiety and merry-making at the\r\nVatican; in banquets, dancing, the performance of comedies, masques,\r\netc., was the time made to pass as agreeably as might be for the guests\r\nfrom Ferrara, and in all Cesare was conspicuous, either for the grace\r\nand zest with which he nightly danced, or for the skill and daring\r\nwhich he displayed in the daily joustings and entertainments, and more\r\nparticularly in the bull-fight that was included in them.\r\n\r\nLucrezia was splendidly endowed, to the extent, it was estimated,\r\nof 300,000 ducats, made up by 100,000 ducats in gold, her jewels and\r\nequipage, and the value of the Castles of Pieve and Cento. Her departure\r\nfrom Rome took place on January 6, and so she passes out of this\r\nchronicle, which, after all, has been little concerned with her.\r\n\r\nOf the honour done her everywhere on that journey to Ferrara, the\r\ndetails are given elsewhere, particularly in the book devoted to her\r\nhistory and rehabilitation by Herr Gregorovius. After all, the real\r\nLucrezia Borgia fills a comparatively small place in the actual history\r\nof her house. It is in the fictions concerning her family that she is\r\ngiven such unenviable importance, and presented as a Maenad, a poisoner,\r\nand worse. In reality she appears to us, during her life in Rome, as a\r\nrather childish, naïve, and entirely passive figure, important only in\r\nso far as she found employment at her father’s or brother’s hands for\r\nthe advancement of their high ambitions and unscrupulous aims.\r\n\r\nIn the popular imagination she lives chiefly as a terrific poisoner, an\r\nappalling artist in venenation. It is remarkable that this should be the\r\ncase, for not even the scandal of her day so much as suggests that\r\nshe was connected--directly or even indirectly--with a single case of\r\npoisoning. No doubt that popular conception owes its being entirely to\r\nVictor Hugo’s drama.\r\n\r\nAway from Rome and settled in Ferrara from the twenty-second year of her\r\nage, to become anon its duchess, her life is well known and admits of\r\nno argument. The archives of the State she ruled show her devout,\r\ngod-fearing, and beloved in life, and deeply mourned in death by a\r\nsorrowing husband and a sorrowing people. Not a breath of scandal\r\ntouches her from the moment that she quits the scandalous environment of\r\nthe Papal Court.\r\n\r\nCesare continued at the Vatican after her departure. His duchess was to\r\nhave come to Rome in that Easter of 1502, and it had been disposed that\r\nthe ladies and gentlemen who had gone as escort of honour with Lucrezia\r\nshould proceed--after leaving her in Ferrara--to Lombardy, to do the\r\nlike office by Charlotte d’Albret, and, meeting her there, accompany her\r\nto Rome. She was coming with her brother, the Cardinal Amanieu d’Albret,\r\nand bringing with her Cesare’s little daughter, Louise de Valentinois,\r\nnow two years of age. But the duchess fell ill at the last moment, and\r\nwas unable to undertake the journey, of which Cardinal d’Albret brought\r\nword to Rome, where he arrived on February 7.\r\n\r\nTen days later Cesare set out with his father for Piombino, for which\r\npurpose six galleons awaited them at Civita Vecchia under the command\r\nof Lodovico Mosca, the captain of the Pontifical navy. On these the\r\nPope and his son embarked, upon their visit to the scene of the latest\r\naddition to Cesare’s ever-growing dominions.\r\n\r\nThey landed at Piombino on February 21, and made a solemn entrance into\r\nthe town, the Pope carried in state in the Sedia Gestatoria, under\r\na canopy, attended by six cardinals and six singers from the Sixtine\r\nChapel, whilst Cesare was accompanied by a number of his gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThey abode four days in Piombino, whence they crossed to Elba, for the\r\npurpose of disposing for the erection there of two fortresses--a matter\r\nmost probably entrusted to Leonardo da Vinci, who continued in the ducal\r\ntrain as architect and engineer.\r\n\r\nOn March 1 they took ship to return to Rome; but they were detained\r\nat sea for five days by a tempest which seems to have imperilled\r\nthe vessels. The Pope was on board the captain’s galley with his\r\ncardinals-in-waiting and servants, and when these were reduced by\r\nthe storm and the imminent danger to a state of abject terror, the\r\nPope--this old man of seventy-one--sat calm and intrepid, occasionally\r\ncrossing himself and pronouncing the name of Jesus, and encouraging the\r\nvery sailors by his example as much as by his words.\r\n\r\nIn Piombino Cesare had left Michele da Corella as his governor. This\r\nCorella was a captain of foot, a soldier of fortune, who from the\r\nearliest days of Cesare’s military career had followed the duke’s\r\nfortunes--the very man who is alleged to have strangled Alfonso of\r\nAragon by Cesare’s orders. He is generally assumed to have been a\r\nSpaniard, and is commonly designated as Michelotto, or Don Miguel; but\r\nAlvisi supposes him, from his name of Corella, to have been a Venetian,\r\nand he tells us that by his fidelity to Cesare and the implicit\r\nmanner in which he executed his master’s orders, he earned--as is\r\nnotorious--considerable hatred. He has been spoken of, indeed, as the\r\nâme damnée of Cesare Borgia; but that is a purely romantic touch akin to\r\nthat which gave the same designation to Richelieu’s Father Joseph.\r\n\r\nThe Romagna was at this time administered for Cesare Borgia by Ramiro\r\nde Lorqua, who, since the previous November, had held the office of\r\nGovernor in addition to that of Lieutenant-General in which he had\r\nbeen earlier invested. His power in the Romagna was now absolute, all\r\nCesare’s other officers, even the very treasurers, being subject to him.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of some fifty years of age, violent and domineering, feared\r\nby all, and the dispenser of a harsh justice which had at least the\r\nmerit of an impartiality that took no account of persons.\r\n\r\nBernardi gives us an instance of the man’s stern, uncompromising,\r\npitiless nature. On January 29, 1502, two malefactors were hanged in\r\nFaenza. The rope suspending one of them broke while the fellow was\r\nalive, and the crowd into which he tumbled begged for mercy for him at\r\nfirst, then, swayed by pity, the people resolved to save him in spite\r\nof the officers of justice who demanded his surrender. Preventing\r\nhis recapture, the mob bore him off to the Church of the Cerviti. The\r\nLieutenant of Faenza came to demand the person of the criminal, but he\r\nwas denied by the Prior, who claimed to extend him sanctuary.\r\n\r\nBut the days of sanctuary were overpast, and the laws of the time held\r\nthat any church or consecrated place in which a criminal took refuge\r\nshould ipso facto be deemed unconsecrated by his pursuers, and further,\r\nthat any ecclesiastic sheltering such a fugitive did so under peril of\r\nexcommunication from his bishop. This law Ramiro accounted it his duty\r\nto enforce when news was carried to him at Imola of what had happened.\r\n\r\nHe came at once to Faenza, and, compelling the Prior by actual force\r\nto yield up the man he sheltered, he hanged the wretch, for the second\r\ntime, from a window of the Palace of the Podestá. At the same time he\r\nseized several who were alleged to have been ringleaders of the fellow’s\r\nrescue from the hands of the officers, and made the citizens of Faenza\r\ncompromise for the lives of these by payment of a fine of 10,000 ducats,\r\ngiving them a month in which to find the money.\r\n\r\nThe Faentini sent their envoys to Ramiro to intercede with him; but that\r\nharsh man refused so much as to grant them audience--which was well for\r\nthem, for, as a consequence, the Council sent ambassadors to Rome to\r\nsubmit the case to the Pope’s Holiness and to the Duke of Valentinois,\r\ntogether with a petition that the fine should be remitted--a petition\r\nthat was readily granted.\r\n\r\nHarsh as it was, however, Ramiro’s rule was salutary, its very harshness\r\nnecessary in a province where lawlessness had become a habit through\r\ngenerations of misgovernment. Under Cesare’s dominion the change already\r\nwas remarkable. During his two years of administration--to count from\r\nits commencement--the Romagna was already converted from a seething\r\nhell of dissensions, disorders and crimes--chartered brigandage and\r\nmurder--into a powerful State, law-abiding and orderly, where human life\r\nand personal possessions found zealous protection, and where those who\r\ndisturbed the peace met with a justice that was never tempered by mercy.\r\n\r\nA strong hand was wanted there, and the duke, supreme judge of the tools\r\nto do his work, ruled the Romagna and crushed its turbulence by means of\r\nthe iron hand of Ramiro de Lorqua.\r\n\r\nIt was also under the patronage of Valentinois that the first\r\nprinting-press of any consequence came to be established in Italy. This\r\nwas set up at Fano by Girolamo Sancino in 1501, and began the issue of\r\nworthy books. One of the earliest works undertaken (says Alvisi) was the\r\nprinting of the Statutes of Fano for the first time in January of 1502.\r\nAnd it was approved by the Council, civil and ecclesiastical, that\r\nSancino should undertake this printing of the Statutes “Ad perpetuam\r\nmemoriam Illmi. Domini nostri Ducis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. URBINO AND CAMERINO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may well be that it was about this time that Cesare, his ambition\r\nspreading--as men’s ambition will spread with being gratified--was\r\nconsidering the consolidation of Central Italy into a kingdom of which\r\nhe would assume the crown.\r\n\r\nIt was a scheme in the contemplation of which he was encouraged by\r\nVitellozzo Vitelli, who no doubt conceived that in its fulfilment the\r\nruin of Florence would be entailed--which was all that Vitelli cared\r\nabout. What to Cesare would have been no more than the means, would have\r\nbeen to Vitelli a most satisfactory end.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, going so far there was still the work of subjugating\r\nthe States of the Church to be completed, as this could not be so\r\nconsidered until Urbino, Camerino, and Sinigaglia should be under the\r\nBorgia dominion.\r\n\r\nFor this, no doubt, Cesare was disposing during that Easter of 1502\r\nwhich he spent in Rome, and during which there were heard from the south\r\nthe first rumblings of the storm of war whereof ill-starred Naples was\r\nonce more--for the third time within ten years--to be the scene. The\r\nallies of yesterday were become the antagonists of to-day, and France\r\nand Spain were ready to fly at each other’s throats over the division of\r\nthe spoil, as a consequence of certain ill-definitions of the matter\r\nin the treaty of Granada. The French Viceroy, Louis d’Armagnac, and the\r\ngreat Spanish Captain, Gonzalo de Cordoba, were on the point of coming\r\nto blows.\r\n\r\nNor was the menace of disturbance confined to Naples. In Florence, too,\r\nthe torch of war was alight, and if--as he afterwards swore--Cesare\r\nBorgia had no hand in kindling it, it is at least undeniable that he\r\ncomplacently watched the conflagration, conscious that it would make\r\nfor the fulfilment of his own ends. Besides, there was still that little\r\nmatter of the treaty of Forno dei Campi between Cesare and Florence,\r\na treaty which the Signory had never fulfilled and never intended to\r\nfulfil, and Cesare was not the man to forget how he had been fooled.\r\n\r\nBut for the protection of France which she enjoyed, Florence must long\r\nere this have been called to account by him, and crushed out of\r\nall shape under the weight of his mailed hand. As it was she was to\r\nexperience the hurt of his passive resentment, and find this rather more\r\nthan she could bear.\r\n\r\nVitellozzo Vitelli, that vindictive firebrand whose original motive in\r\nallying himself with Cesare had been the hope that the duke might help\r\nhim to make Florence expiate his brother’s blood, finding that Cesare\r\nwithheld the expected help, was bent at last upon dealing, himself,\r\nwith Florence. He entered into plots with the exiled Piero de’Medici\r\nto restore the latter to his dominion; he set intrigues afoot in Pisa,\r\nwhere his influence was vast, and in Siena, whose tyrant, Pandolfo\r\nPetrucci, was ready and willing to forward his designs, and generally\r\nmade so disturbing a stir in Tuscany that the Signory became gravely\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\nCesare certainly took no apparent active part in the affair. He lent\r\nVitelli no aid; but neither did he attempt to restrain him or any other\r\nof the Borgia condottieri who were allied with him.\r\n\r\nThe unrest, spreading and growing sullenly a while, burst suddenly forth\r\nin Arezzo on June 4, when the cries of “Medici!” and “Marzocco!” rang\r\nin its streets, to announce that the city was in arms against the\r\ngovernment of Florence. Arezzo followed this up by summoning Vitelli,\r\nand the waiting, watchful condottiero was quick to answer the desired\r\ncall. He entered the town three days later at the head of a small body\r\nof foot, and was very shortly afterwards followed by his brother\r\nGiulio Vitelli, Bishop of Città di Castello, with the artillery, and,\r\npresently, by Gianpaolo Baglioni with a condotta of horse.\r\n\r\nA few days later Vitelli was in possession of all the strongholds of\r\nthe Val di Chiana, and panic-stricken Florence was speeding ambassadors\r\nhot-foot to Rome to lay her complaints of these matters before the Pope.\r\n\r\nAlexander was able to reply that, far from supporting the belligerents,\r\nhe had launched a Bull against them, provoked by the poisoning of the\r\nBishop de’Pazzi.\r\n\r\nCesare looked on with the inscrutable calm for which Macchiavelli was\r\npresently to find him so remarkable. Aware as he was of the French\r\nprotection which Florence enjoyed and could invoke, he perceived how\r\nvain must ultimately prove Vitelli’s efforts, saw, perhaps, in all\r\nthis the grave danger of ultimate ruin which Vitelli was incurring. Yet\r\nVitelli’s action served Cesare’s own purposes, and, so that his purposes\r\nwere served, there were no other considerations likely to weigh with\r\nthat cold egotist. Let Vitelli be caught in the toils he was spinning,\r\nand be choked in them. Meanwhile, Florence was being harrowed, and\r\nthat was all to Cesare’s satisfaction and advantage. When sufficiently\r\nhumbled, it might well befall that the Republic should come on her knees\r\nto implore his intervention, and his pardon for having flouted him.\r\n\r\nWhile matters stood so in Arezzo, Pisa declared spontaneously for\r\nCesare, and sent (on June 10) to offer herself to his dominion and to\r\nannounce to him that his banner was already flying from her turrets--and\r\nthe growth of Florence’s alarm at this is readily conceived.\r\n\r\nTo Cesare it must have been a sore temptation. To accept such a\r\npied-à-terre in Tuscany as was now offered him would have been the first\r\ngreat step towards founding that kingdom of his dreams. An impulsive\r\nman had surely gulped the bait. But Cesare, boundless in audacity, most\r\nswift to determine and to act, was not impulsive. Cold reason, foresight\r\nand calculation were the ministers of his indomitable will. He looked\r\nahead and beyond in the matter of Pisa’s offer, and he perceived the\r\ndanger that might await him in the acceptance. The time for that was\r\nnot yet. To take what Pisa offered might entail offending France, and\r\nalthough Cesare was now in case to dispense with French support, he was\r\nin no case to resist her opposition.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the matter being considered and determined, Cesare quitted Rome\r\non the 12th and left it for the Pope to give answer to the Pisan envoys\r\nin the Consistory of June 14--that neither his Holiness nor the Duke of\r\nValentinois could assent to the proposals which Pisa made.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome Cesare travelled swiftly to Spoleto, where his army, some ten\r\nthousand strong, was encamped. He was bent at last upon the conquest\r\nof Camerino, and, ever an opportunist, he had seized the moment when\r\nFlorence, which might have been disposed to befriend Varano, Tyrant of\r\nCamerino, was over-busy with her own affairs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the powerful army awaiting him at Spoleto, the duke had\r\na further 2,000 men in the Romagna; another 1,000 men held themselves\r\nat his orders between Sinigaglia and Urbino, and Dionigio di Naldo was\r\narming yet another 1,000 men at Verucchio for his service. Yet further\r\nto increase this force, Cesare issued an edict during his brief sojourn\r\nat Spoleto ordering every house in the Romagna to supply him with one\r\nman-at-arms.\r\n\r\nIt was whilst here--as he afterwards wrote to the Pope--that news\r\nreached him that Guidobaldo da Montefeltre, Duke of Urbino, was arming\r\nmen and raising funds for the assistance of Camerino. He wrote that\r\nhe could not at first believe it, but that shortly afterwards--at\r\nFoligni--he took a chancellor of Camerino who admitted that the hopes\r\nof this State were all founded upon Urbino’s assistance; and later, a\r\nmessenger from Urbino falling into his hands, he discovered that there\r\nwas a plot afoot to seize the Borgia artillery as it passed through\r\nUgubio, it being known that, as Cesare had no suspicions, the guns would\r\nbe guarded only by a small force. Of this treachery the duke strongly\r\nexpressed his indignation in his letter to the Pope.\r\n\r\nWhether the matter was true--or whether Cesare believed it to be\r\ntrue--it is impossible to ascertain with absolute conviction. But it\r\nis in the highest degree unlikely that Cesare would have written such\r\na letter to his father solely by way of setting up a pretext. Had that\r\nbeen his only aim, letters expressing his simulated indignation would\r\nhave been in better case to serve his ends had they been addressed to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIf Guidobaldo did engage in such an act, amounting to a betrayal, he was\r\ncertainly paid by Cesare in kind and with interest. If the duke had\r\nbeen short of a pretext for carrying a drawn sword into the dominions\r\nof Guidobaldo, he had that pretext now in this act of enmity against\r\nhimself and the Holy See.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, he disposed for the attack upon Camerino. This State,\r\nlying on the Eastern spurs of the Apennines, midway between Spoleto and\r\nUrbino, was ruled by Giulio Cesare Varano, an old war-dog of seventy\r\nyears of age, ruthless and bloodthirsty, who owed his throne to his\r\nmurder of his own brother.\r\n\r\nHe was aided in the government of his tyranny by his four sons,\r\nVenanzio, Annibale, Pietro, and Gianmaria.\r\n\r\nSeveral times already had he been menaced by Cesare Borgia, for he was\r\none of the Vicars proscribed for the non-payment of tribute due to\r\nthe Holy See, and at last his hour was come. Against him Cesare now\r\ndispatched an army under the command of Francesco Orsini, Duke of\r\nGravina, and Oliverotto Eufreducci, another murderous, bloody gentleman\r\nwho had hitherto served the duke in Vitelli’s condotta, and who, by an\r\natrocious act of infamy and brigandage, had made himself Lord of Fermo,\r\nwhich he pretended--being as sly as he was bloody--to hold as Vicar for\r\nthe Holy See.\r\n\r\nThis Oliverotto Eufreducci--hereafter known as Oliverotto da Fermo--was\r\na nephew of Giovanni Fogliano, Lord of Fermo. He had returned home to\r\nhis uncle’s Court in the early part of that year, and was there received\r\nwith great honour and affection by Fogliano and his other relatives.\r\nTo celebrate his home-coming, Oliverotto invited his uncle and the\r\nprincipal citizens of Fermo to a banquet, and at table contrived to turn\r\nthe conversation upon the Pope and the Duke of Valentinois; whereupon,\r\nsaying that these were matters to be discussed more in private, he rose\r\nfrom table and begged them to withdraw with him into another room.\r\n\r\nAll unsuspecting--what should old Fogliano suspect from one so loved and\r\nso deeply in his debt?--they followed him to the chamber where he had\r\nsecretly posted a body of his men-at-arms. There, no sooner had the\r\ndoor closed upon this uncle, and those others who had shown him so\r\nmuch affection, than he gave the signal for the slaughter that had been\r\nconcerted. His soldiers fell upon those poor, surprised victims of his\r\ngreed, and made a speedy and bloody end of all.\r\n\r\nThat first and chief step being taken, Oliverotto flung himself on his\r\nhorse, and, gathering his men-at-arms about him, rode through Fermo on\r\nthe business of butchering what other relatives and friends of Fogliano\r\nmight remain. Among these were Raffaele della Rovere and two of his\r\nchildren, one of whom was inhumanly slaughtered in its mother’s lap.\r\n\r\nThereafter he confiscated to his own uses the property of those whom he\r\nhad murdered, and of those who, more fortunate, had fled his butcher’s\r\nhands. He dismissed the existing Council and replaced it by a government\r\nof his own. Which done--to shelter himself from the consequences--he\r\nsent word to the Pope that he held Fermo as Vicar of the Church.\r\n\r\nWhilst a portion of his army marched on Camerino, Cesare, armed with his\r\npretext for the overthrow of Guidobaldo, set himself deliberately and\r\nby an elaborate stratagem to the capture of Urbino. Of this there can\r\nbe little doubt. The cunning of the scheme is of an unsavoury sort, when\r\nconsidered by the notions that obtain to-day, for the stratagem was no\r\nbetter than an act of base treachery. Yet, lest even in this you should\r\nbe in danger of judging Cesare Borgia by standards which cannot apply to\r\nhis age, you will do well to consider that there is no lack of evidence\r\nthat the fifteenth century applauded the business as a clever coup.\r\n\r\nGuidobaldo da Montefeltre was a good prince. None in all Italy was\r\nmore beloved by his people, towards whom he bore himself with a kindly,\r\npaternal bonhomie. He was a cultured, scholarly man, a patron of the\r\narts, happiest in the splendid library of the Palace of Urbino. It\r\nhappened, unfortunately, that he had no heir, which laid his dominions\r\nopen to the danger of division amongst the neighbouring greedy tyrants\r\nafter his death. To avoid this he had adopted Francesco Maria della\r\nRovere, hereditary Prefect of Sinigaglia, his sister’s child and\r\na nephew of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere’s. There was wisdom and\r\nforesight in the adoption, considering the favour enjoyed in Rome and in\r\nFrance by the powerful cardinal.\r\n\r\nFrom Nocera Cesare sent Guidobaldo a message calculated to allay\r\nwhatever uneasiness he may have been feeling, and to throw him\r\ncompletely off his guard. The duke notified him that he was marching\r\nupon Camerino--which was at once true and untrue--and begged Guidobaldo\r\nto assist him in this enterprise by sending him provisions to Gubbio,\r\nwhich he should reach on the morrow--since he was marching by way of\r\nCagli and Sassoferrato. Further--and obviously with intent that the\r\nDuke of Urbino should reduce the forces at his disposal--he desired\r\nGuidobaldo to send Vitelli the support of a thousand men, which the\r\nlatter had earlier solicited, but which Guidobaldo had refused to\r\nsupply without orders from the Pope. Cesare concluded his letter with\r\nprotestations of brotherly love--the Judas’ kiss which makes him hateful\r\nto us in this affair.\r\n\r\nIt all proved very reassuring to Guidobaldo who set his mind at ease\r\nand never bethought him of looking to his defences, when, from Nocera,\r\nCesare made one of those sudden movements, terrible in their swiftness\r\nas the spring of a tiger--enabling him to drive home his claws where\r\nleast expected. Leaving all baggage behind him, and with provisions\r\nfor only three days, he brought his troops by forced marches to Cagli,\r\nwithin the Urbino State, and possessed himself of it almost before the\r\ntown had come to realize his presence.\r\n\r\nNot until the citadel, taken entirely by surprise, was in Cesare’s hands\r\ndid a messenger speed to Guidobaldo with the unwelcome tidings that\r\nthe Duke of Valentinois was in arms, as an enemy, within the territory.\r\nTogether with that message came others into the garden of the Zoccolanti\r\nmonastery--that favourite resort of Guidobaldo’s--where he was indulging\r\nhis not unusual custom of supping in the cool of that summer evening.\r\nThey brought him word that, while Valentinois was advancing upon him\r\nfrom the south, a force of 1,000 men were marching upon Urbino from\r\nIsola di Fano in the east, and twice that number through the passes\r\nof Sant’ Angelo and Verucchio in the north--all converging upon his\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe attack had been shrewdly planned and timed, and if anything can\r\ncondone the treachery by which Guidobaldo was lulled into his false\r\nsecurity, it is the circumstance that this conduct of the matter avoided\r\nbloodshed--a circumstance not wholly negligible, and one that was ever\r\na part of Cesare Borgia’s policy, save where punishment had to be\r\ninflicted or reprisals taken.\r\n\r\nGuidobaldo, seeing himself thus beset upon all sides at once, and\r\nbeing all unprepared for resistance, perceived that nothing but flight\r\nremained him; and that very night he left Urbino hurriedly, taking with\r\nhim the boy Francesco Maria, and intending at first to seek shelter in\r\nhis Castle of S. Leo--a fortress that was practically impregnable. But\r\nalready it was too late. The passes leading thither were by now in\r\nthe hands of the enemy, as Guidobaldo discovered at dawn. Thereupon,\r\nchanging his plans, he sent the boy and his few attendants to Bagno,\r\nand, himself, disguised as a peasant, took to the hills, despite the\r\ngout by which he was tormented. Thus he won to Ravenna, which was fast\r\nbecoming a home for dethroned princes.\r\n\r\nUrbino, meanwhile, in no case to resist, sent its castellan to meet\r\nCesare and to make surrender to him--whereof Cesare, in the letter\r\nalready mentioned, gives news to the Pope, excusing himself for having\r\nundertaken this thing without the Pope’s knowledge, but that “the\r\ntreachery employed against me by Guidobaldo was so enormous that I could\r\nnot suffer it.”\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours of poor Guidobaldo’s flight Cesare was housed in\r\nUrbino’s splendid palace, whose stupendous library was the marvel of\r\nall scholars of that day. Much of this, together with many of the\r\nart-treasures collected by the Montefeltri, Cesare began shortly\r\nafterwards to transfer to Cesena.\r\n\r\nIn addition to publishing an edict against pillage and violence in the\r\nCity of Urbino, Cesare made doubly sure that none should take place\r\nby sending his soldiers to encamp at Fermignano, retaining near him in\r\nUrbino no more than his gentlemen-at-arms. The capital being taken,\r\nthe remainder of the duchy made ready surrender, all the strongholds\r\nannouncing their submission to Cesare with the exception of that\r\nalmost inaccessible Castle of S. Leo, which capitulated only after a\r\nconsiderable resistance.\r\n\r\nFrom Urbino Cesare now entered into communication with the Florentines,\r\nand asked that a representative should be sent to come to an agreement\r\nwith him. In response to this request, the Republic sent him Bishop\r\nSoderini as her ambassador. The latter arrived in Urbino on June 25 and\r\nwas immediately and very cordially received by the duke. With him,\r\nin the subordinate capacity of secretary, came a lean, small-headed,\r\ntight-lipped man, with wide-set, intelligent eyes and prominent\r\ncheek-bones--one Niccolò Macchiavelli, who, in needy circumstances at\r\npresent, and comparatively obscure, was destined to immortal fame. Thus\r\ndid Macchiavelli meet Cesare Borgia for the first time, and, for all\r\nthat we have no records of it, it is not to be doubted that his study of\r\nthat remarkable man began then in Urbino, to be continued presently,\r\nas we shall see, when Macchiavelli returns to him in the quality of an\r\nambassador himself.\r\n\r\nTo Soderini the duke expounded his just grievance, founded upon the\r\nFlorentines’ unobservance of the treaty of Forno dei Campi; he demanded\r\nthat a fresh treaty should be drawn up to replace the broken one, and\r\nthat, for the purpose, Florence should change her government, as in\r\nthe ruling one, after what had passed, he could repose no faith. He\r\ndisclaimed all associations with the affair of Vitelli, but frankly\r\ndeclared himself glad of it, as it had, no doubt, led Florence to\r\nperceive what came of not keeping faith with him. He concluded by\r\nassuring Soderini that, with himself for their friend, the Florentines\r\nneed fear no molestation from any one; but he begged that the Republic\r\nshould declare herself in the matter, since, if she did not care to have\r\nhim for her friend, she was, of course, at liberty to make of him her\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nSo impressed was Soderini by Cesare Borgia that on that same night he\r\nwrote to the Signory:\r\n\r\n“This lord is very magnificent and splendid, and so spirited in feats of\r\narms that there is nothing so great but that it must seem small to him.\r\nIn the pursuit of glory and in the acquisition of dominions he never\r\nrests, and he knows neither danger nor fatigue. He moves so swiftly that\r\nhe arrives at a place before it is known that he has set out for it.\r\nHe knows how to make himself beloved of his soldiers, and he has in his\r\nservice the best men of Italy. These things render him victorious and\r\nformidable, and to these is yet to be added his perpetual good fortune.\r\nHe argues,” the Florentine envoy proceeds, “with such sound reason that\r\nto dispute with him would be a long affair, for his wit and eloquence\r\nnever fail him” (“dello ingegno e della lingua si vale quanto vuole”).\r\n\r\nYou are to remember that this homage is one of the few surviving\r\nimpressions of one who came into personal contact with Cesare, and of\r\none, moreover, representing a Government more or less inimical to him,\r\nwho would therefore have no reason to draw a favourable portrait of\r\nhim for that Government’s benefit. One single page of such testimony is\r\nworth a dozen volumes of speculation and inference drawn afterwards by\r\nmen who never knew him--in many cases by men who never began to know his\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nThe envoy concludes by informing the Signory that he has the duke’s\r\nassurances that the latter has no thought of attempting to deprive\r\nFlorence of any of her possessions, as “the object of his campaign has\r\nnot been to tyrannize, but to extirpate tyrants.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Cesare awaited the Florentines’ reply to their ambassador’s\r\ncommunication, he withdrew to the camp at Fermignano, where he was\r\nsought on July 6 by a herald from Louis XII. This messenger came to\r\nexhort Cesare to embark upon no enterprise against the Florentine\r\nRepublic, because to offend Florence would be to offend the Majesty of\r\nFrance. Simultaneously, however, Florence received messages from the\r\nCardinal d’Amboise, suggesting that they should come to terms with\r\nValentinois by conceding him at least a part of what had been agreed in\r\nthe Treaty of Forno dei Campi.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, Soderini was able to inform Cesare that the Republic\r\nwas ready to treat with him, but that first he must withdraw Vitelli\r\nfrom Arezzo, and compel him to yield up the captured fortresses. The\r\nduke, not trusting--as he had frankly avowed--a Government which once\r\nalready had broken faith with him, and perceiving that, if he whistled\r\nhis war-dogs to heel as requested, he would have lost the advantages of\r\nhis position, refused to take any such steps until the treaty should be\r\nconcluded. He consented, however, to enforce meanwhile an armistice.\r\n\r\nBut now it happened that news reached Florence of the advance of Louis\r\nXII with an army of 20,000 men, bound for Naples to settle the dispute\r\nwith Spain. So the Republic--sly and treacherous as any other Italian\r\nGovernment of the Cinquecento--instructed Soderini to temporize with\r\nthe duke; to spend the days in amiable, inconclusive interviews and\r\ndiscussions of terms which the Signory did not mean to make. Thus they\r\ncounted upon gaining time, until the arrival of the French should put\r\nan end to the trouble caused by Vitelli, and to the need for any\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nBut Cesare, though forced to submit, was not fooled by Soderini’s\r\nsmooth, evasive methods. He too--having private sources of information\r\nin France--was advised of the French advance and of the imminence of\r\ndanger to himself in consequence of the affairs of Florence. And it\r\noccasioned him no surprise to see Soderini come on July 19 to take his\r\nleave of him, advised by the Signory that the French vanguard was at\r\nhand, and that, consequently, the negotiations might now with safety be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nTo console him, he had news on the morrow of the conquest of Camerino.\r\n\r\nThe septuagenarian Giulio Cesare Varano had opposed to the Borgia forces\r\na stout resistance, what time he sent his two sons Pietro and Gianmaria\r\nto Venice for help. It was in the hope of this solicited assistance that\r\nhe determined to defend his tyranny, and the war opened by a cavalry\r\nskirmish in which Venanzio Varano routed the Borgia horse under the\r\ncommand of the Duke of Gravina. Thereafter, however, the Varani had to\r\nendure a siege; and the old story of the Romagna sieges was repeated.\r\nVarano had given his subjects too much offence in the past, and it was\r\nfor his subjects now to call the reckoning.\r\n\r\nA strong faction, led by a patrician youth of Camerino, demanded the\r\nsurrender of the State, and, upon being resisted, took arms and opened\r\nthe gates to the troops of Valentinois. The three Varani were taken\r\nprisoners. Old Giulio Cesare was shut up in the Castle of Pergola, where\r\nhe shortly afterwards died--which was not wonderful or unnatural at his\r\ntime of life, and does not warrant Guicciardini for stating, without\r\nauthority, that he was strangled. Venanzio and Annibale were imprisoned\r\nin the fortress of Cattolica.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this surrender of Camerino, Cesare wrote the\r\nfollowing affectionate letter to his sister Lucrezia--who was\r\ndangerously ill at Ferrara in consequence of her delivery of a\r\nstill-born child:\r\n\r\n“Most Illustrious and most Excellent Lady, our very dear\r\nSister,--Confident of the circumstance that there can be no more\r\nefficacious and salutary medicine for the indisposition from which you\r\nare at present suffering than the announcement of good and happy news,\r\nwe advise you that at this very moment we have received sure tidings of\r\nthe capture of Camerino. We beg that you will do honour to this message\r\nby an immediate improvement, and inform us of it, because, tormented as\r\nwe are to know you so ill, nothing, not even this felicitous event,\r\ncan suffice to afford us pleasure. We beg you also kindly to convey\r\nthe present to the Illustrious Lord Don Alfonso, your husband and our\r\nbeloved Brother-in-law, to whom we are not writing to-day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. THE REVOLT OF THE CONDOTTIERI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coincidence of the arrival of the French army with the conquest of\r\nUrbino and Camerino and the Tuscan troubles caused one more to be added\r\nto that ceaseless stream of rumours that flowed through Italy concerning\r\nthe Borgias. This time the envy and malice that are ever provoked by\r\nsuccess and power gave voice in that rumour to the thing it hoped,\r\nand there ensued as pretty a comedy as you shall find in the pages of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe rumour had it that Louis XII, resentful and mistrustful of the\r\ngrowth of Cesare’s might, which tended to weaken France in Italy and\r\nbecame a menace to the French dominions, was come to make an end of him.\r\nInstantly Louis’s Court in Milan was thronged by all whom Cesare had\r\noffended--and they made up by now a goodly crowd, for a man may not rise\r\nso swiftly to such eminence without raising a rich crop of enemies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Valentinois in the Montefeltre Palace at\r\nUrbino remained extremely at ease. He was not the man to be without\r\nintelligences. In the train of Louis was Francesco Troche, the Pope’s\r\nconfidential chamberlain and Cesare’s devoted servant, who, possessed\r\nof information, was able to advise Valentinois precisely what were the\r\nintentions of the King of France. Gathering from these advices that it\r\nwas Louis’s wish that the Florentines should not be molested further,\r\nand naturally anxious not to run counter to the king’s intentions,\r\nCesare perceived that the time to take action had arrived, the time for\r\npassivity in the affairs of Florence was at an end.\r\n\r\nSo he dispatched an envoy to Vitelli, ordering his instant evacuation\r\nof Arezzo and his withdrawal with his troops from Tuscany, and he backed\r\nthe command by a threat to compel Vitelli by force of arms, and\r\nto punish disobedience by depriving him of his state of Città di\r\nCastello--“a matter,” Cesare informed him, “which would be easily\r\naccomplished, as the best men of that State have already offered\r\nthemselves to me.”\r\n\r\nIt was a command which Vitelli had no choice but to obey, not being\r\nin sufficient force to oppose the duke. So on July 29, with Gianpaolo\r\nBaglioni, he relinquished the possession of Arezzo and departed out of\r\nTuscany, as he had been bidden. But so incensed was he against the duke\r\nfor this intervention between himself and his revenge, and so freely did\r\nhe express himself in the matter, that it was put about at once that he\r\nintended to go against Cesare.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the first hint of the revolt of the condottieri.\r\n\r\nHaving launched that interdict of his, Cesare, on July 25, in the garb\r\nof a knight of St. John of Jerusalem, and with only four attendants,\r\ndeparted secretly from Urbino to repair to Milan and King Louis. He\r\npaused for fresh horses at Forli on the morrow, and on the 28th reached\r\nFerrara, where he remained for a couple of hours to visit Lucrezia, who\r\nwas now in convalescence. Ahead of him he dispatched, thence, a courier\r\nto Milan to announce his coming, and, accompanied by Alfonso d’Este,\r\nresumed his journey.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the assembly of Cesare’s enemies had been increasing daily in\r\nMilan, whither they repaired to support Louis and to vent their hatred\r\nof Cesare and their grievances against him. There, amongst others,\r\nmight be seen the Duke of Urbino, Pietro Varano (one of the sons of\r\nthe deposed Lord of Camerino), Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro, and Francesco\r\nGonzaga of Mantua--which latter was ever ready to turn whichever way the\r\nwind was blowing, and was now loudest in his denunciations of Cesare and\r\neagerly advocating the formation of a league against him.\r\n\r\nLouis received the news of Cesare’s coming, and--endowed, it is clear,\r\nwith a nice sense of humour-­kept the matter secret until within a\r\nfew hours of the duke’s actual arrival. On the morning of August 5,\r\naccording to Bernardi,(1) he whispered the information in Trivulzio’s\r\near-­and whispered it loudly enough to be overheard by those courtiers\r\nwho stood nearest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 Cronache Forlivesi.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever check their satisfaction at the supposed state of things may\r\nhave received then was as nothing to their feelings a few hours later\r\nwhen they witnessed the greeting that passed between king and duke.\r\nUnder their uneasy eyes Louis rode forth to meet his visitor, and gave\r\nhim a glad and friendly welcome, addressing him as “cousin” and “dear\r\nrelative,” and so, no doubt, striking dismay into the hearts of those\r\ncourtiers, who may well have deemed that perhaps they had expressed\r\nthemselves too freely.\r\n\r\nLouis, in person, accompanied Valentinois to the apartments prepared\r\nfor him in the Castle of Milan, and on the morrow gave a banquet and\r\ncommanded merry-makings in his visitor’s honour.\r\n\r\nConceive the feelings of those deposed tyrants and their friends, and\r\nthe sudden collapse of the hopes which they had imagined the king to be\r\nencouraging. They did, of course, the only thing there was to do. They\r\ntook their leave precipitately and went their ways--all save Gonzaga,\r\nwhom the king retained that he might make his peace with Cesare, and\r\nengage in friendship with him, a friendship consolidated there and then\r\nby the betrothal of their infant children: little Francesco Gonzaga\r\nand Louise de Valentinois, aged two, the daughter whom Cesare had never\r\nbeheld and was never to behold.\r\n\r\nTwo factors were at work in the interests of Valentinois--the coming war\r\nin Naples with the Spaniard, which caused Louis to desire to stand well\r\nwith the Pope; and the ambition of Louis’s friend and counsellor, the\r\nCardinal d’Amboise, to wear the tiara, which caused this prelate to\r\ndesire to stand well with Cesare himself, since the latter’s will in\r\nthe matter of a Pope to succeed his father should be omnipotent with the\r\nSacred College.\r\n\r\nTherefore, that they might serve their interests in the end, both king\r\nand cardinal served Cesare’s in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Valentinois’s visit to Milan had served to increase the\r\ncholer of Vitelli, who accounted that by this action Cesare had put him\r\nin disgrace with the King of France; and Vitelli cried out that thus was\r\nhe repaid for having sought to make Cesare King of Tuscany. In such high\r\ndudgeon was the fierce Tyrant of Città di Castello that he would not go\r\nto pay his court to Louis, and was still the more angry to hear of the\r\nwarm welcome accorded in Milan to the Cardinal Orsini. In this he\r\nread approval of the Orsini for having stood neutral in the Florentine\r\nbusiness, and, by inference from that, disapproval of himself.\r\n\r\nBefore accusing Valentinois of treachery to his condottieri, before\r\nsaying that he shifted the blame of the Tuscan affair on to the\r\nshoulders of his captains, it would be well to ascertain that there was\r\nany blame to shift--that is to say, any blame that must originally have\r\nfallen upon Cesare. Certainly he made no effort to restrain Vitelli\r\nuntil the King of France had arrived and he had secret information which\r\ncaused him to deem it politic to intervene. But of what avail until that\r\nmoment, would any but an armed intervention have been with so vindictive\r\nand one-idea’d a man, and what manner of fool would not Cesare have\r\nbeen to have spent his strength in battle with his condottieri for the\r\npurpose of befriending a people who had never shown themselves other\r\nthan his own enemies?\r\n\r\nLike the perfect egotist he was, he sat on the fence, and took pleasure\r\nin the spectacle of the harassing of his enemies by his friends,\r\nprepared to reap any advantages there might be, but equally prepared to\r\navoid any disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIt was not heroic, it was not noble; but it was extremely human.\r\n\r\nCesare was with the King of France in Genoa at the end of August, and\r\nremained in his train until September 2, when finally he took his leave\r\nof him. When they heard of his departure from the Court of Louis, his\r\nnumerous enemies experienced almost as much chagrin as that which had\r\nbeen occasioned them by his going thither. For they had been consoling\r\nthemselves of late with a fresh rumour; and again they were believing\r\nwhat it pleased them to believe. Rumours, you perceive, were never\r\nwanting where the Borgias were concerned, and it may be that you are\r\nbeginning to rate these voces populi at their proper value, and to\r\napprehend the worth of many of those that have been embalmed as truths\r\nin the abiding records.\r\n\r\nThis last one had it that Louis was purposely keeping Cesare by him, and\r\nintended ultimately to carry him off to France, and so put an end to the\r\ndisturbances the duke was creating in Italy. What a consolation would\r\nnot that have been to those Italian princelings to whose undoing he had\r\nwarred! And can you marvel that they believed and circulated so readily\r\nthe thing for which they hoped so fondly? By your appreciation of that\r\nmay you measure the fresh disappointment that was theirs.\r\n\r\nSo mistaken were they, indeed, as it now transpired, that Louis had\r\nactually, at last, removed his protection from Bologna, under the\r\npersuasion of Cesare and the Pope. Before the duke took his departure\r\nfrom King Louis’s Court, the latter entered into a treaty with him in\r\nthat connection to supply him with three hundred lances: “De bailler au\r\nValentinois trois cents lances pour l’aider à conquérir Bologne au nome\r\nde l’Eglise, et opprimer les Ursins, Baillons et Vitelozze.”\r\n\r\nIt was a double-dealing age, and Louis’s attitude in this affair\r\nsorted well with it. Feeling that he owed Bologna some explanation, he\r\npresently sent a singularly lame one by Claude de Seyssel. He put it\r\nthat the Bentivogli personally were none the less under his protection\r\nthan they had been hitherto, but that the terms of the protection\r\nprovided that it was granted exclusively of the rights and authority\r\nof the Holy Roman See over Bologna, and that the king could not embroil\r\nhimself with the Pope. With such a shifty message went M. de Seyssel\r\nto make it quite clear to Bentivogli what his position was. And on the\r\nheels of it came, on September 2, a papal brief citing Bentivogli and\r\nhis two sons to appear before the Pontiff within fifteen days for the\r\npurpose of considering with his Holiness the matter of the pacification\r\nand better government of Bologna, which for so many years had been so\r\ndisorderly and turbulent. Thus the Pope’s summons, with a menace that\r\nwas all too thinly veiled.\r\n\r\nBut Bentivogli was not taken unawares. He was not even astonished. Ever\r\nsince Cesare’s departure from Rome in the previous spring he had been\r\ndisposing against such a possibility as this--fortifying Bologna,\r\nthrowing up outworks and erecting bastions beyond the city, and levying\r\nand arming men, in all of which he depended largely upon the citizens\r\nand particularly upon the art-guild, which was devoted to the House of\r\nBentivogli.\r\n\r\nStronger than the affection for their lord--which, when all is said,\r\nwas none too great in Bologna--was the deep-seated hatred of the clergy\r\nentertained by the Bolognese. This it was that rallied to Bentivogli\r\nsuch men as Fileno della Tuate, who actually hated him. But it was a\r\nchoice of evils with Fileno and many of his kidney. Detesting the ruling\r\nhouse, and indignant at the injustices it practised, they detested the\r\npriests still more--so much that they would have taken sides with Satan\r\nhimself against the Pontificals. In this spirit did they carry their\r\nswords to Bentivogli.\r\n\r\nUpon the nobles Bentivogli could not count--less than ever since the\r\ncold-blooded murder of the Marescotti; but in the burghers’ adherence he\r\ndeemed himself secure, and indeed on September 17 he had some testimony\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nOn that date--the fortnight’s grace expiring--the brief was again read\r\nto the Reggimento; but it was impossible to adopt any resolution. The\r\npeople were in arms, and, with enormous uproar, protested that they\r\nwould not allow Giovanni Bentivogli or his sons to go to Rome, lest they\r\nshould be in danger once they had left their own State.\r\n\r\nItaly was full of rumours at the time of Cesare’s proposed emprise\r\nagainst Bologna, and it was added that he intended, further, to make\r\nhimself master of Città di Castello and Perugia, and thus, by depriving\r\nthem of their tyrannies, punish Vitelli and Baglioni for their\r\ndefection.\r\n\r\nThis was the natural result of the terms of Cesare’s treaty with France\r\nhaving become known; but the part of it which regarded the Orsini,\r\nVitelli, and Baglioni was purely provisional. Considering that these\r\ncondottieri were now at odds with Cesare, they might see fit to consider\r\nthemselves bound to Bentivogli by the Treaty of Villafontana, signed by\r\nVitelli and Orsini on the duke’s behalf at the time of the capitulation\r\nof Castel Bolognese. They might choose to disregard the fact that this\r\ntreaty had already been violated by Bentivogli himself, through the\r\nnon-fulfilment of the terms of it, and refuse to proceed against him\r\nupon being so bidden by Valentinois.\r\n\r\nIt was for such a contingency as this that provision was made by the\r\nclause concerning them in Cesare’s treaty with Louis.\r\n\r\nThe Orsini were still in the duke’s service, in command of troops levied\r\nfor him and paid by him, and considering that with them Cesare had no\r\nquarrel, it is by no means clear why they should have gone over to the\r\nalliance of the condottieri that was now forming against the duke. Join\r\nit, however, they did. They, too, were in the Treaty of Villafontana;\r\nbut that they should consider themselves bound by it, would have\r\nbeen--had they urged it--more in the nature of a pretext than a reason.\r\nBut they chose a pretext even more slender. They gave out that in Milan\r\nLouis XII had told Cardinal Orsini that the Pope’s intention was to\r\ndestroy the Orsini.\r\n\r\nTo accept such a statement as true, we should have to believe in a\r\ndisloyalty and a double-dealing on the part of Louis XII altogether\r\nincredible. To what end should he, on the one side, engage to assist\r\nCesare with 300 lances to “oppress” the Orsini--if necessary, and among\r\nothers--whilst, on the other, he goes to Orsini with the story which\r\nthey attribute to him? What a mean, treacherous, unkingly figure must\r\nhe not cut as a consequence! He may have been--we know, indeed, that he\r\nwas--no more averse to double­dealing than any other Cinquecentist; but\r\nhe was probably as averse to being found out in a meanness and made\r\nto look contemptible as any double-dealer of our own times. It is a\r\nconsideration worth digesting.\r\n\r\nWhen word of the story put about by the Orsini was carried to the\r\nPope he strenuously denied the imputation, and informed the Venetian\r\nambassador that he had written to complain of this to the King of\r\nFrance, and that, far from such a thing being true, Cesare was so\r\ndevoted to the Orsini as to be “more Orsini than Borgian.”\r\n\r\nIt is further worth considering that the defection of the Orsini was\r\nneither immediate nor spontaneous, as must surely have been the case had\r\nthe story been true. It was the Baglioni and Vitelli only who first met\r\nto plot at Todi, to declare that they would not move against their ally\r\nof Bologna, and to express the hope that they might bring the Orsini to\r\nthe same mind. They succeeded so well that the second meeting was held\r\nat Magione--a place belonging to the powerful Cardinal Orsini, situated\r\nnear the Baglioni’s stronghold of Perugia. Vitellozzo was carried\r\nthither on his bed, so stricken with the morbo gallico--which in Italy\r\nwas besetting most princes, temporal and ecclesiastical--that he was\r\nunable to walk.\r\n\r\nGentile and Gianpaolo Baglioni, Cardinal Gianbattista Orsini, Francesco\r\nOrsini, Duke of Gravina, Paolo Orsini, the bastard son of the Archbishop\r\nof Trani, Pandolfo Petrucci--Lord of Siena--and Hermes Bentivogli were\r\nall present. The last-named, prone to the direct methods of murder by\r\nwhich he had rid Bologna of the Marescotti, is said to have declared\r\nthat he would kill Cesare Borgia if he but had the opportunity, whilst\r\nVitelli swore solemnly that within a year he would slay or capture the\r\nduke, or else drive him out of Italy.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the Diet of Magione was no mere defensive\r\nalliance, but actually an offensive one, with the annihilation of Cesare\r\nBorgia for its objective.\r\n\r\nThey certainly had the power to carry out their resolutions, for\r\nwhilst Cesare disposed at that moment of not more than 2,500 foot, 300\r\nmen-at-arms, and the 100 lances of his Caesarean guard of patricians,\r\nthe confederates had in arms some 9,000 foot and 1,000 horse. Conscious\r\nof their superior strength, they determined to strike at once, before\r\nCesare should be further supported by the French lances, and to make\r\nsure of him by assailing him on every side at once. To this end it was\r\nresolved that Bentivogli should instantly march upon Imola, where Cesare\r\nlay, whilst the others should possess themselves of Urbino and Pesaro\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nThey even approached Florence and Venice in the matter, inviting the\r\nRepublics to come into the league against Valentinois.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, however, could not trust such enemies of their own as\r\nVitelli and the Orsini, nor dared they join in an enterprise which had\r\nfor scope to make war upon an ally of France; and they sent word to\r\nCesare of their resolve to enter into no schemes against him.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians would gladly have moved to crush a man who had snatched\r\nthe Romagna from under their covetous eyes; but in view of the league\r\nwith France they dared not. What they dared, they did. They wrote to\r\nLouis at length of the evils that were befalling Italy at the hands of\r\nthe Duke of Valentinois, and of the dishonour to the French crown which\r\nlay for Louis in his alliance with Cesare Borgia. They even went so\r\nfar--and most treacherously, considering the league--as to allow their\r\nfamous captain, Bartolomeo d’Alviano, to reconduct Guidobaldo to Urbino,\r\nas we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nHad the confederates but kept faith with one another Cesare’s knell\r\nhad soon been tolled. But they were a weak-kneed pack of traitors,\r\nirresolute in their enmity as in their friendships. The Orsini hung\r\nback. They urged that they did not trust themselves to attack Cesare\r\nwith men actually in his pay; whilst Bentivogli--treacherous by nature\r\nto the back-bone of him--actually went so far as to attempt to open\r\nsecret negotiations with Cesare through Ercole d’Este of Ferrara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. MACCHIAVELLI’S LEGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 2 news of the revolt of the condottieri and the diet of\r\nMagione had reached the Vatican and rendered the Pope uneasy. Cesare,\r\nhowever, had been informed of it some time before at Imola, where he was\r\nawaiting the French lances that should enable him to raid the Bolognese\r\nand drive out the Bentivogli.\r\n\r\nWhere another might have been paralyzed by a defection which left him\r\nalmost without an army, and would have taken the course of sending\r\nenvoys to the rebels to attempt to make terms and by concessions to\r\npatch up a treaty, Cesare, with characteristic courage, assurance, and\r\npromptitude of action, flung out officers on every side to levy him\r\nfresh troops.\r\n\r\nHis great reputation as a condottiero, the fame of his wealth and his\r\nnotorious liberality, stood him now in excellent stead. The response to\r\nhis call was instantaneous. Soldiers of fortune and mercenaries showed\r\nthe trust they had in him, and flocked to his standard from every\r\nquarter. One of the first to arrive was Gasparo Sanseverino, known as\r\nFracassa, a condottiero of great renown, who had been in the Pontifical\r\nservice since the election of Pope Alexander. He was a valuable\r\nacquisition to Cesare, who placed him in command of the horse. Another\r\nwas Lodovico Pico della Mirandola, who brought a small condotta of 60\r\nlances and 60 light horse. Ranieri della Sassetta rode in at the head\r\nof 100 mounted arbalisters, and Francesco de Luna with a body of 50\r\narquebusiers.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  The arquebus, although it had existed in Italy for nearly a century,\r\nwas only just coming into general use.\r\n\r\n\r\nValentinois sent out Raffaele dei Pazzi and Galeotto Pallavicini, the\r\none into Lombardy to recruit 1,000 Gascons, the other to raise a body of\r\nSwiss mercenaries. Yet, when all is said, these were but supplementary\r\nforces; the main strength of Cesare’s new army lay in the troops raised\r\nin the Romagna, which, faithful to him and confident of his power and\r\nsuccess, rallied to him now in the hour of his need. Than this there can\r\nbe no more eloquent testimony to the quality of his rule. In command of\r\nthese Romagnuoli troops he placed such Romagnuoli captains as Dionigio\r\ndi Naldo and Marcantonio da Fano, thereby again affording proof of his\r\nwisdom, by giving these soldiers their own compatriots and men with whom\r\nthey were in sympathy for their leaders.\r\n\r\nWith such speed had he acted, and such was the influence of his name,\r\nthat already, by October 14, he had assembled an army of upwards of\r\n6,000 men, which his officers were diligently drilling at Imola, whilst\r\ndaily now were the French lances expected, and the Swiss and Gascon\r\nmercenaries he had sent to levy.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that this gave the confederates pause, and suggested\r\nto them that they should reconsider their position and ask themselves\r\nwhether the opportunity for crushing Cesare had not slipped by whilst\r\nthey had stood undecided.\r\n\r\nIt was Pandolfo Petrucci who took the first step towards a\r\nreconciliation, by sending word to Valentinois that it was not his\r\nintention to take any measures that might displease his Excellency. His\r\nExcellency will no doubt have smiled at that belated assurance from\r\nthe sparrow to the hawk. Then, a few days later, came news that Giulio\r\nOrsini had entered into an agreement with the Pope. This appeared to\r\ngive the confederacy its death-blow, and Paolo Orsini was on the point\r\nof setting out to seek Cesare at Imola for the purpose of treating\r\nwith him--which would definitely have given burial to the revolt--when\r\nsuddenly there befell an event which threw the scales the other way.\r\n\r\nCesare’s people were carrying out some work in the Castle of S. Leo,\r\nin the interior of which a new wall was in course of erection. For the\r\npurposes of this, great baulks of timber were being brought into the\r\ncastle from the surrounding country. Some peasants, headed by one\r\nBrizio, who had been a squire of Guidobaldo’s, availed themselves of the\r\ncircumstance to capture the castle by a stratagem. Bringing forward some\r\ngreat masses of timber and felled trees, they set them down along the\r\ndrawbridge in such a manner as to prevent its being hoisted. That done,\r\nan attack in force was directed against the fortress. The place, whose\r\nnatural defences rendered it practically impregnable, was but slightly\r\nmanned; being thus surprised, and unable to raise the bridge, it was\r\npowerless to offer any resistance, so that the Montefeltre peasants,\r\nhaving killed every Borgia soldier of the garrison, took possession of\r\nit and held it for Duke Guidobaldo.\r\n\r\nThis capture of S. Leo was as a spark that fired a train. Instantly the\r\nhardy hillmen of Urbino were in arms to reconquer Guidobaldo’s duchy for\r\nhim. Stronghold after stronghold fell into their hands, until they\r\nwere in Urbino itself. They made short work of the capital’s scanty\r\ndefenders, flung Cesare’s governor into prison, and finally obtained\r\npossession of the citadel.\r\n\r\nIt was the news of this that caused the confederates once more to pause.\r\nBefore declaring themselves, they waited to see what action Venice would\r\ntake, whilst in the meantime they sought shelter behind a declaration\r\nthat they were soldiers of the Church and would do nothing against the\r\nwill of the Pontiff. They were confidently assured that Venice would\r\nbefriend Guidobaldo, and help him back to his throne now that his own\r\npeople had done so much towards that end. It remained, however, to be\r\nseen whether Venice would at the same time befriend Pesaro and Rimini.\r\n\r\nInstantly Cesare Borgia--who was assailed by grave doubts concerning the\r\nVenetians--took his measures. He ordered Bartolomeo da Capranica, who\r\nwas chief in command of his troops in Urbino, to fall back upon Rimini\r\nwith all his companies, whilst to Pesaro the duke dispatched Michele da\r\nCorella and Ramiro de Lorqua.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy time of action with the duke at Imola, and yet, amid all\r\nthe occupation which this equipment of a new army must have given him,\r\nhe still found time for diplomatic measures, and, taking advantage of\r\nthe expressed friendliness of Florence, he had replied by desiring\r\nthe Signory to send an envoy to confer with him. Florence responded by\r\nsending, as her representative, that same Niccolò Macchiavelli who had\r\nearlier accompanied Soderini on a similar mission to Valentinois, and\r\nwho had meanwhile been advanced to the dignity of Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli has left us, in his dispatches to his Government, the\r\nmost precious and valuable information concerning that period of Cesare\r\nBorgia’s history during which he was with the duke on the business of\r\nhis legation. Not only is it the rare evidence of an eye-witness that\r\nMacchiavelli affords us, but the evidence, as we have said, of one\r\nendowed with singular acumen and an extraordinary gift of psychological\r\nanalysis. The one clear and certain inference to be drawn, not only from\r\nthose dispatches, but from the Florentine secretary’s later writings,\r\nis that, at close quarters with Cesare Borgia, a critical witness of his\r\nmethods, he conceived for him a transcending admiration which was later\r\nto find its fullest expression in his immortal book The Prince--a\r\nbook, remember, compiled to serve as a guide in government to Giuliano\r\nde’Medici, the feeble brother of Pope Leo X, a book inspired by Cesare\r\nBorgia, who is the model prince held up by Macchiavelli for emulation.\r\n\r\nDoes it serve any purpose, in the face of this work from the pen of the\r\nacknowledged inventor of state-craft, to describe Cesare’s conquest\r\nof the Romagna by opprobrious epithets and sweeping statements of\r\ncondemnation and censure--statements kept carefully general, and never\r\npermitted to enter into detail which must destroy their own ends and\r\nexpose their falsehood?\r\n\r\nGregorovius, in this connection, is as full of contradictions as any\r\nman must be who does not sift out the truth and rigidly follow it in his\r\nwritings. Consider the following scrupulously translated extracts from\r\nhis Geschichte der Stadt Rom:\r\n\r\n  (a) “Cesare departed from Rome to resume his bloody work in the\r\nRomagna.”\r\n\r\n  (b) “...the frightful deeds performed by Cesare on both sides of the\r\nApennines. He assumes the semblance of an exterminating angel, and\r\nperforms such hellish iniquities that we can only shudder at the\r\ncontemplation of the evil of which human nature is capable.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, pray, consider and compare with those the following excerpt\r\nfrom the very next page of that same monumental work:\r\n\r\n“Before him [Cesare] cities trembled; the magistrates prostrated\r\nthemselves in the dust; sycophantic courtiers praised him to the stars.\r\nYet it is undeniable that his government was energetic and good; for\r\nthe first time Romagna enjoyed peace and was rid of her vampires. In the\r\nname of Cesare justice was administered by Antonio di Monte Sansovino,\r\nPresident of the Ruota of Cesena, a man universally beloved.”\r\n\r\nIt is almost as if the truth had slipped out unawares, for the first\r\nperiod hardly seems a logical prelude to the second, by which it is\r\nlargely contradicted. If Cesare’s government was so good that Romagna\r\nknew peace at last and was rid of her vampires, why did cities tremble\r\nbefore him? There is, by the way, no evidence of such trepidations in\r\nany of the chronicles of the conquered States, one and all of which hail\r\nCesare as their deliverer. Why, if he was held in such terror, did city\r\nafter city--as we have seen--spontaneously offer itself to Cesare’s\r\ndominion?\r\n\r\nBut to rebut those statements of Gregorovius’s there is scarce the need\r\nto pose these questions; sufficiently does Gregorovius himself\r\nrebut them. The men who praised Cesare, the historian tells us, were\r\nsycophantic courtiers. But where is the wonder of his being praised if\r\nhis government was as good as Gregorovius admits it to have been? What\r\nwas unnatural in that praise? What so untruthful as to deserve to be\r\nbranded sycophantic? And by what right is an historian to reject as\r\nsycophants the writers who praise a man, whilst accepting every word\r\nof his detractors as the words of inspired evangelists, even when\r\ntheir falsehoods are so transparent as to provoke the derision of the\r\nthoughtful and analytic?\r\n\r\nAs l’Espinois points out in his masterly essay in the Revue des\r\nQuestions Historiques, Gregorovius refuses to recognize in Cesare Borgia\r\nthe Messiah of a united Central Italy, but considers him merely as\r\na high-flying adventurer; whilst Villari, in his Life and Times of\r\nMacchiavelli, tells you bluntly that Cesare Borgia was neither a\r\nstatesman nor a soldier but a brigand-chief.\r\n\r\nThese are mere words; and to utter words is easier than to make them\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n“High-flying adventurer,” or “brigand-chief,” by all means, if it\r\nplease you. What but a high-flying adventurer was the wood-cutter, Muzio\r\nAttendolo, founder of the ducal House of Sforza? What but a high-flying\r\nadventurer was that Count Henry of Burgundy who founded the kingdom\r\nof Portugal? What else was the Norman bastard William, who conquered\r\nEngland? What else the artillery officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, who became\r\nEmperor of the French? What else was the founder of any dynasty but a\r\nhigh-flying adventurer--or a brigand-chief, if the melodramatic term is\r\nmore captivating to your fancy?\r\n\r\nThese terms are used to belittle Cesare. They achieve no more, however,\r\nthan to belittle those who penned them; for, even as they are true,\r\nthe marvel is that the admirable matter in these truths appears to have\r\nescaped those authors.\r\n\r\nWhat else Gregorovius opines--that Cesare was no Messiah of United\r\nItaly--is true enough. Cesare was the Messiah of Cesare. The well-being\r\nof Italy for its own sake exercised his mind not so much as\r\nthe well-being of the horse he rode. He wrought for his own\r\naggrandisement--but he wrought wisely; and, whilst the end in view is no\r\nmore to be censured than the ambition of any man, the means employed\r\nare in the highest degree to be commended, since the well-being of\r\nthe Romagna, which was not an aim, was, nevertheless, an essential and\r\npraiseworthy incident.\r\n\r\nWhen it can be shown that every other of those conquerors who cut heroic\r\nfigures in history were purest altruists, it will be time to damn Cesare\r\nBorgia for his egotism.\r\n\r\nWhat Villari says, for the purpose of adding rhetorical force to\r\nhis “brigand-chief”--that Cesare was no statesman and no soldier--is\r\nentirely of a piece with the rest of the chapter in which it\r\noccurs(1)--a chapter rich in sweeping inaccuracies concerning Cesare.\r\nBut it is staggering to find the statement in such a place, amid\r\nMacchiavelli’s letters on Cesare, breathing an obvious and profound\r\nadmiration of the duke’s talents as a politician and a soldier--an\r\nadmiration which later is to go perilously near to worship. To\r\nMacchiavelli, Cesare is the incarnation of a hazy ideal, as is\r\nabundantly shown in The Prince. For Villari to reconcile all this with\r\nhis own views must seem impossible. And impossible it is; yet Villari\r\nachieves it, with an audacity that leaves you breathless.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  In his Niccolò Machiavelli.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo--he practically tells you--this Macchiavelli, who daily saw and spoke\r\nwith Cesare for two months (and during a critical time, which is when\r\nmen best reveal their natures), this acute Florentine--the acutest\r\nman of his age, perhaps--who studied and analysed Cesare, and sent his\r\nGovernment the results of his analyses, and was inspired by them later\r\nto write The Prince--this man did not know Cesare Borgia. He wrote, not\r\nabout Cesare himself, but about a creation of his own intellect.\r\n\r\nThat is what Villari pretends. Macchiavelli, the representative of a\r\npower unfriendly at heart under the mask of the expedient friendliness,\r\nhis mind already poisoned by all the rumours current throughout Italy,\r\ncomes on this mission to Valentinois. Florence, fearing and hating\r\nValentinois as she does, would doubtless take pleasure in detractory\r\nadvices. Other ambassadors--particularly those of Venice--pander to\r\ntheir Governments’ wishes in this respect, conscious that there is a\r\nsycophancy in slander contrasted with which the ordinary sycophancy of\r\nflattery is as water to wine; they diligently send home every scrap\r\nof indecent or scandalous rumour they can pick up in the Roman\r\nante-chambers, however unlikely, uncorroborated, or unconcerning the\r\nbusiness of an ambassador.\r\n\r\nBut Macchiavelli, in Cesare Borgia’s presence, is overawed by his\r\ngreatness, his force and his intellect, and these attributes engage him\r\nin his dispatches. These same dispatches are a stumbling-block to all\r\nwho prefer to tread the beaten, sensational track, and to see in\r\nCesare Borgia a villain of melodrama, a monster of crime, brutal, and,\r\nconsequently, of no intellectual force. But Villari contrives to step\r\nmore or less neatly, if fatuously, over that formidable obstacle, by\r\ntelling you that Macchiavelli presents to you not really Cesare Borgia,\r\nbut a creation of his own intellect, which he had come to admire. It\r\nis a simple, elementary expedient by means of which every piece of\r\nhistorical evidence ever penned may be destroyed--including all that\r\nwhich defames the House of Borgia.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli arrived at Imola on the evening of October 7, 1502, and,\r\nall travel-stained as he was, repaired straight to the duke, as if\r\nthe message with which he was charged was one that would not brook a\r\nmoment’s delay in its deliverance. Actually, however, he had nothing to\r\noffer Cesare but the empty expressions of Florence’s friendship and\r\nthe hopes she founded upon Cesare’s reciprocation. The crafty young\r\nFlorentine--he was thirty-three at the time--was sent to temporize and\r\nto avoid committing himself or his Government.\r\n\r\nValentinois listened to the specious compliments, and replied by similar\r\nprotestations and by reminding Florence how he had curbed the hand\r\nof those very condottieri who had now rebelled against him as a\r\nconsequence. He showed himself calm and tranquil at the loss of Urbino,\r\ntelling Macchiavelli that he “had not forgotten the way to reconquer\r\nit,” when it should suit him. Of the revolted condottieri he\r\ncontemptuously said that he accounted them fools for not having known\r\nhow to choose a more favourable moment in which to harm him, and that\r\nthey would presently find such a fire burning under their feet as would\r\ncall for more water to quench it than such men as these disposed of.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the success of those rustics of Urbino who had risen, and\r\nthe ease of their victories, had fired others of the territory to follow\r\ntheir example. Fossombrone and Pergola were the next to rebel and to put\r\nthe Borgia garrisons to the sword; but, in their reckless audacity,\r\nthey chose their moment ill, for Michele da Corella was at hand with his\r\nlances, and, although his orders had been to repair straight to Pesaro,\r\nhe ventured to depart from them to the extent of turning aside to punish\r\nthe insurgence of those towns by launching his men-at-arms upon them and\r\nsubjecting them to an appalling and pitiless sack.\r\n\r\nWhen Cesare heard the news of it and the details of the horrors that had\r\nbeen perpetrated, he turned, smiling cruelly, to Macchiavelli, who\r\nwas with him, and, “The constellations this year seem unfavourable to\r\nrebels,” he observed.\r\n\r\nA battle of wits was toward between the Florentines’ Secretary of State\r\nand the Duke of Valentinois, each mistrustful of the other. In the end\r\nCesare, a little out of patience at so much inconclusiveness, though\r\noutwardly preserving his immutable serenity, sought to come to grips by\r\ndemanding that Florence should declare whether he was to account her his\r\nfriend or not. But this was precisely what Macchiavelli’s instructions\r\nforbade him from declaring. He answered that he must first write to the\r\nSignory, and begged the duke to tell him what terms he proposed should\r\nform the treaty. But there it was the duke’s turn to fence and to avoid\r\na direct answer, desiring that Florence should open the negotiations and\r\nthat from her should come the first proposal.\r\n\r\nHe reminded Macchiavelli that Florence would do well to come to a\r\ndecision before the Orsini sought to patch up a peace with him, since,\r\nonce that was done, there would be fresh difficulties, owing, of course,\r\nto Orsini’s enmity to the existing Florentine Government. And of such a\r\npeace there was now every indication, Paolo Orsini having at last\r\nsent Cesare proposals for rejoining him, subject to his abandoning the\r\nBologna enterprise (in which, the Orsini argued, they could not bear\r\na hand without breaking faith with Bentivogli) and turning against\r\nFlorence. Vitelli, at the same time, announced himself ready to return\r\nto Cesare’s service, but first he required some “honest security.”\r\n\r\nWell might it have pleased Cesare to oblige the Orsini to the letter,\r\nand to give a lesson in straight-dealing to these shuffling Florentine\r\npedlars who sent a nimble-witted Secretary of State to hold him in play\r\nwith sweet words of barren meaning. But there was France and her wishes\r\nto be considered, and he could not commit himself. So his answer was\r\nperemptory and condescending. He told them that, if they desired to show\r\nthemselves his friends, they could set about reconquering and holding\r\nUrbino for him.\r\n\r\nIt looked as if the condottieri agreed to this, for on October 11\r\nVitelli seized Castel Durante, and on the next day Baglioni was in\r\npossession of Cagli.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, Cesare bade the troops which he had withdrawn to\r\nadvance again upon the city of Urbino and take possession of it. But\r\nsuddenly, on the 12th, a messenger from Guidobaldo rode into Urbino to\r\nannounce their duke’s return within a few days to defend the subjects\r\nwho had shown themselves so loyal to him. This, the shifty confederates\r\naccounted, must be done with the support of Venice, whence they\r\nconcluded that Venice must have declared against Valentinois, and again\r\nthey treacherously changed sides.\r\n\r\nThe Orsini proceeded to prompt action. Assured of their return to\r\nhimself, and counting upon their support in Urbino, Cesare had contented\r\nhimself with sending thither a small force of 100 lances and 200\r\nlight horse. Upon these fell the Orsini, and put them to utter rout at\r\nCalmazzo, near Fossombrone, capturing Ugo di Moncada, who commanded\r\none of the companies, but missing Michele da Corella, who contrived to\r\nescape to Fossombrone.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors entered Urbino that evening, and, as if to put it on\r\nrecord that they burnt their boats with Valentinois, Paolo Orsini wrote\r\nthat same night to the Venetian Senate advices of the victory won.\r\nThree days later--on October 18--Guidobaldo, accompanied by his nephews\r\nOttaviano Fregioso and Gianmaria Varano, re-entered his capital amid the\r\ncheers and enthusiasm of his loyal and loving people.\r\n\r\nVitelli made haste to place his artillery at Guidobaldo’s disposal for\r\nthe reduction of Cagli, Pergola, and Fossombrone, which were still held\r\nfor Valentinois, whilst Oliverotto da Fermo went with Gianmaria Varano\r\nto attempt the reconquest of Camerino, and Gianpaolo Baglioni to Fano,\r\nwhich, however, he did not attempt to enter as an enemy--an idle course,\r\nseeing how loyally the town held for Cesare--but as a ducal condottiero.\r\n\r\nFired by Orsini’s example, Bentivogli also took the offensive, and began\r\nby ordering the canonists of Bologna University to go to the churches\r\nand encourage the people to disregard the excommunications launched\r\nagainst the city. He wrote to the King of France to complain that Cesare\r\nhad broken the Treaty of Villafontana by which he had undertaken never\r\nagain to molest Bologna--naïvely ignoring the circumstance that he\r\nhimself had been the first to violate the terms of that same treaty, and\r\nthat it was precisely upon such grounds that Cesare was threatening him.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood, the confederates turning anxious eyes towards\r\nVenice, and, haply, beginning to wonder whether the Republic was indeed\r\ngoing to move to their support as they had so confidently expected, and\r\nrealizing perhaps by now their rashness, and the ruin that awaited them\r\nshould Venice fail them. And fail them Venice did. The Venetians had\r\nreceived a reply from Louis XII to that letter in which they had heaped\r\nodium upon the Borgia and shown the king what dishonour to himself dwelt\r\nin his alliance with Valentinois. Their criticisms and accusations were\r\nignored in that reply, which resolved itself into nothing more than a\r\nthreat that “if they opposed themselves to the enterprise of the Church\r\nthey would be treated by him as enemies,” and of this letter he sent\r\nCesare a copy, as Cesare himself told Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\nSo, whilst Valentinois in Imola was able to breathe more freely, the\r\ncondottieri in Urbino may well have been overcome with horror at their\r\nposition and at having been thus left in the lurch by Venice. None was\r\nbetter aware than Pandolfo Petrucci of the folly of their action and of\r\nthe danger that now impended, and he sent his secretary to Valentinois\r\nto say that if the duke would but reassure them on the score of his\r\nintentions they would return to him and aid him in recovering what had\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\nFollowing upon this message came Paolo Orsini himself to Imola on the\r\n25th, disguised as a courier, and having first taken the precaution of\r\nobtaining a safe-conduct. He left again on the 29th, bearing with him\r\na treaty the terms of which had been agreed between himself and Cesare\r\nduring that visit. These were that Cesare should engage to protect the\r\nStates of all his allied condottieri, and they to serve him and the\r\nChurch in return. A special convention was to follow, to decide the\r\nmatter of the Bentivogli, which should be resolved by Cesare, Cardinal\r\nOrsini, and Pandolfo Petrucci in consultation, their judgment to be\r\nbinding upon all.\r\n\r\nCesare’s contempt for the Orsini and the rest of the shifty men who\r\nformed that confederacy--that “diet of bankrupts,” as he had termed\r\nit--was expressed plainly enough to Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\n“To-day,” said he, “Messer Paolo is to visit me, and to-morrow there\r\nwill be the cardinal; and thus they think to befool me, at their\r\npleasure. But I, on my side, am only dallying with them. I listen to all\r\nthey have to say and bide my own time.”\r\n\r\nLater, Macchiavelli was to remember those words, which meanwhile\r\nafforded him matter for reflection.\r\n\r\nAs Paolo Orsini rode away from Imola, the duke’s secretary, Gherardi,\r\nfollowed and overtook him to say that Cesare desired to add to the\r\ntreaty another clause--one relating to the King of France. To this Paolo\r\nOrsini refused to consent, but, upon being pressed in the matter by\r\nGherardi, went so far as to promise to submit the clause to the others.\r\n\r\nOn October 30 Cesare published a notice in the Romagna, intimating the\r\nreturn to obedience on the part of his captains.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli was mystified by this, and apprehensive--as men will be\r\nof the things they cannot fathom--of what might be reserved in it for\r\nFlorence. It was Gherardi who reassured him, laughing in the face of the\r\ncrafty Florentine, as he informed him that even children should come to\r\nsmile at such a treaty as this. He added that he had gone after Paolo\r\nOrsini to beg the addition of another clause, intentionally omitted by\r\nthe duke.\r\n\r\n“If they accept that clause,” concluded Messer Agabito, “it will open a\r\nwindow; if they refuse it, a door, by which the duke can issue from the\r\ntreaty.”\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli’s wonder increased. But the subject of it now was that the\r\ncondottieri should be hoodwinked by a document in such terms, and well\r\nmay he have bethought him then of those words which Cesare had used to\r\nhim a few days earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. RAMIRO DE LORQUA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt really seemed as if the condottieri were determined to make their\r\nscore as heavy as possible. For even whilst Paolo Orsini had been on his\r\nmission of peace to Cesare, and whilst they awaited his return, they had\r\ncontinued in arms against the duke. The Vitelli had aided Guidobaldo\r\nto reconquer his territory, and had killed, in the course of doing so,\r\nBartolomeo da Capranica, Cesare’s most valued captain and Vitelli’s\r\nbrother­in-arms of yesterday. The Baglioni were pressing Michele da\r\nCorella in Pesaro, but to little purpose; whilst the butcher Oliverotto\r\nda Fermo in Camerino--of which he had taken possession with Gianmaria\r\nVarano--was slaughtering every Spaniard he could find.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Corella in Pesaro hanged five men whom he caught\r\npractising against the duke’s government, and, having taken young Pietro\r\nVarano--who was on his way to join his brother in Camerino in view of\r\nthe revolt there--he had him strangled in the market-place. There is a\r\nstory that, with life not yet extinct, the poor youth was carried into\r\nchurch by the pitiful crowd. But here a friar, discovering that he still\r\nlived, called in the soldiers and bade them finish him. This friar,\r\ngoing later through Cagli, was recognized, set upon by a mob, and torn\r\nto pieces--in which, if the rest of the tale be true, he was richly\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nInto the theatre of bloodshed came Paolo Orsini from his mission\r\nto Valentinois, bringing with him the treaty for signature by the\r\ncondottieri. Accustomed as they were to playing fast and loose,\r\nthey opined that, so far as Urbino was concerned, enough changes of\r\ngovernment had they contrived there already. Vitelli pointed out the\r\nunseemliness of once again deposing Guidobaldo, whom they had just\r\nreseated upon his throne. Besides, he perceived in the treaty the end\r\nof his hopes of a descent upon Florence, which was the cause of all his\r\nlabours. So he rejected it.\r\n\r\nBut Valentinois had already got the Orsini and Pandolfo Petrucci on\r\nhis side, and so the confederacy was divided. Another factor came to\r\nbefriend the duke. On November 2 he was visited by Antonio Galeazzo\r\nBentivogli, sent by his father Giovanni to propose a treaty with\r\nhim--this state of affairs having been brought about by the mediation of\r\nErcole d’Este. From the negotiations that followed it resulted that, on\r\nthe 13th, the Orsini had word from Cesare that he had entered into\r\nan alliance with the Bentivogli--which definitely removed their main\r\nobjection to bearing arms with him.\r\n\r\nIt was resigning much on Cesare’s part, but the treaty, after all, was\r\nonly for two years, and might, of course, be broken before then, as they\r\nunderstood these matters. This treaty was signed at the Vatican on the\r\n23rd, between Borgia and Bentivogli, to guarantee the States of both.\r\nThe King of France, the Signory of Florence, and the Duke of Ferrara\r\nguaranteed the alliance.\r\n\r\nInter alia, it was agreed between them that Bologna should supply Cesare\r\nwith 100 lances and 200 light horse for one or two enterprises within\r\nthe year, and that the condotta of 100 lances which Cesare held from\r\nBologna by the last treaty should be renewed. The terms of the treaty\r\nwere to be kept utterly secret for the next three months, so that\r\nthe affairs of Urbino and Camerino should not be prejudiced by their\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nThe result was instantaneous. On November 27 Paolo Orsini was back at\r\nImola with the other treaty, which bore now the signatures of all the\r\nconfederates. Vitelli, finding himself isolated, had swallowed his\r\nchagrin in the matter of Florence, and his scruples in the matter of\r\nUrbino, abandoning the unfortunate Guidobaldo to his fate. This came\r\nswiftly. From Imola, Paolo Orsini rode to Fano on the 29th, and ordered\r\nhis men to advance upon Urbino and seize the city in the Duke of\r\nValentinois’s name, proclaiming a pardon for all rebels who would be\r\nsubmissive.\r\n\r\nGuidobaldo and the ill-starred Lord of Faenza were the two exceptions in\r\nRomagna--the only two who had known how to win the affections of their\r\nsubjects. For Guidobaldo there was nothing that the men of Urbino would\r\nnot have done. They rallied to him now, and the women of Valbone--like\r\nthe ladies of England to save Coeur-de-Lion--came with their jewels and\r\ntrinkets, offering them that he might have the means to levy troops and\r\nresist. But this gentle, kindly Guidobaldo could not subject his country\r\nto further ravages of war; and so he determined, in his subjects’\r\ninterests as much as in his own, to depart for the second time.\r\n\r\nEarly in December the Orsini troops are in his territory, and Paolo,\r\nhalting them a few miles out of Urbino, sends to beg Guidobaldo’s\r\nattendance in his camp. Guidobaldo, crippled by gout and unable at the\r\ntime to walk a step, sends Paolo his excuses and begs that he will come\r\nto Urbino, where he awaits him. There Guidobaldo makes formal surrender\r\nto him, takes leave of his faithful friends, enjoins fidelity to\r\nValentinois and trust in God, and so on December 19 he departs into\r\nexile, the one pathetic noble figure amid so many ignoble ones. Paolo,\r\ntaking possession of the duchy, assumes the title of governor.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines had had their chance of an alliance with Cesare, and had\r\ndeliberately neglected it. Early in November they had received letters\r\nfrom the King of France urging them to come to an accord with Cesare,\r\nand they had made known to the duke that they desired to reoccupy Pisa\r\nand to assure themselves of Vitelli; but, when he pressed that Florence\r\nshould give him a condotta, Macchiavelli--following his instructions\r\nnot to commit the Republic in any way--had answered “that his Excellency\r\nmust not be considered as other lords, but as a new potentate in Italy,\r\nwith whom it is more seemly to make an alliance or a friendship than to\r\ngrant him a condotta; and, as alliances are maintained by arms, and\r\nthat is the only power to compel their observance, the Signory could\r\nnot perceive what security they would have when three-quarters or\r\nthree-fifths of their arms would be in the duke’s hands.” Macchiavelli\r\nadded diplomatically that “he did not say this to impugn the duke’s\r\ngood faith, but to show him that princes should be circumspect and never\r\nenter into anything that leaves a possibility of their being put at a\r\ndisadvantage.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  See the twenty-first letter from Macchiavelli on this legation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCesare answered him calmly (“senza segno d’alterazione alcuna”) that\r\nwithout a condotta, he didn’t know what to make of a private friendship\r\nwhose first principles were denied him. And there the matter hung,\r\nfor Macchiavelli’s legation had for only aim to ensure the immunity\r\nof Tuscany and to safeguard Florentine interests without conceding any\r\nadvantages to Cesare--as the latter had perceived from the first.\r\n\r\nOn December 10 Cesare moved from Imola with his entire army, intent now\r\nupon the conquest of Sinigaglia, which State Giuliano della Rovere had\r\nbeen unable to save for his nephew, as king and Pope had alike turned\r\na deaf ear upon the excuses he had sought to make for the Prefetessa,\r\nGiovanna da Montefeltre--the mother of the young prefect--who had aided\r\nher brother Guidobaldo in the late war in Urbino.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Valentinois arrived in Cesena and encamped his army there\r\nfor Christmas, as in the previous year. The country was beginning\r\nto feel the effects of this prolonged vast military occupation, and\r\nalthough the duke, with intent to relieve the people, had done all that\r\nwas possible to provision the troops, and had purchased from Venice\r\n30,000 bushels of wheat for the purpose, yet all had been consumed. “The\r\nvery stones have been eaten,” says Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\nTo account for this state of things--and possibly for certain other\r\nmatters--Messer Ramiro de Lorqua, the Governor-General, was summoned\r\nfrom Pesaro; whilst to avert the threatened famine Cesare ordered that\r\nthe cereals in the private granaries of Cesena should be sold at reduced\r\nprices, and he further proceeded, at heavy expense, to procure grain\r\nfrom without. Another, less far-seeing than Valentinois, might have\r\nmade capital out of Urbino’s late rebellion, and pillaged the country to\r\nprovide for pressing needs. But that would have been opposed to Cesare’s\r\npolicy, of fostering the goodwill of the people he subjected.\r\n\r\nOn December 20 three of the companies of French lances that had been\r\nwith Cesare took their leave of him and returned to Lombardy, so\r\nthat Cesare was left with only one company. There appears to be some\r\nconfusion as to the reasons for this, and it is stated by some\r\nthat those companies were recalled to Milan by the French governor.\r\nMacchiavelli, ever inquisitive and inquiring, questioned one of the\r\nFrench officers in the matter, to be told that the lances were returning\r\nbecause the duke no longer needed them, the inference being that this\r\nwas in consequence of the return of the condottieri to their allegiance.\r\nBut the astute secretary did not at the time account this convincing,\r\narguing that the duke could not yet be said to be secure, nor could\r\nhe know for certain how far he might trust Vitelli and the Orsini.\r\nPresumably, however, he afterwards obtained more certain information,\r\nfor he says later that Valentinois himself dismissed the French, and\r\nthat the dismissal was part of the stratagem he was preparing, and had\r\nfor object to reassure Vitelli and the other confederates, and to throw\r\nthem off their guard, by causing them to suppose him indifferently\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nBut the departure of the French did not take place without much\r\ndiscussion being provoked, and rumour making extremely busy, whilst\r\nit was generally assumed that it would retard the Sinigaglia conquest.\r\nNevertheless, the duke calmly pursued his preparations, and proceeded\r\nnow to send forward his artillery. There was no real ground upon which\r\nto assume that he would adopt any other course. Cesare was now in\r\nconsiderable strength, apart from French lances, and even as these\r\nleft him he was joined by a thousand Swiss, and another six hundred\r\nRomagnuoli from the Val di Lamone. Moreover, as far as the reduction of\r\nSinigaglia was concerned, no resistance was to be expected, for Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere had written enjoining the people to surrender\r\npeacefully to the duke.\r\n\r\nWhat matters Cesare may have found in Cesena to justify the arrest of\r\nhis Governor-General we do not know to the full with absolute certainty.\r\nOn December 22 Ramiro de Lorqua, coming from Pesaro in response to his\r\nmaster’s summons, was arrested on his arrival and flung into prison. His\r\nexamination was to follow.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli, reporting the arrest, says: “It is thought he [Cesare] may\r\nsacrifice him to the people, who have a very great desire of it.”\r\n\r\nRamiro had made himself detested in Romagna by the ruthlessness of his\r\nrule, and a ruthless servant reflects upon his master, a matter which\r\ncould nowise suit Borgia. To all who have read The Prince it will be\r\nclear that upon that ground alone--of having brought Valentinois’s\r\njustice into disrepute by the harshness which in Valentinois’s name he\r\npractised--Macchiavelli would have approved the execution of Ramiro.\r\nHe would have accounted it perfectly justifiable that Ramiro should\r\nbe sacrificed to the people for no better reason than because he had\r\nprovoked their hatred, since this sacrifice made for the duke’s welfare.\r\nHe does, as a matter of fact, justify this execution, but upon much\r\nfuller grounds than these. Still, had the reasons been no better than\r\nare mentioned, he would still have justified it upon those. So much\r\nis clear; and, when so much is clear, much more will be clear to you\r\ntouching this strange epoch.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, more than a matter of sacrificing the\r\nGovernor-General to the hatred of the people. There was, for one thing,\r\nthe matter of that wheat which had disappeared. Ramiro was charged with\r\nhaving fraudulently sold it to his own dishonest profit, putting\r\nthe duke to the heavy expense of importing fresh supplies for the\r\nnourishment of the people. The seriousness of the charge will be\r\nappreciated when it is considered that, had a famine resulted from\r\nthis peculation, grave disorder might have ensued and perhaps even a\r\nrebellion against a government which could provide no better.\r\n\r\nThe duke published the news of the governor’s arrest throughout Romagna.\r\nHe announced his displeasure and regret at the harshnesses and corrupt\r\npractices of Ramiro de Lorqua, in spite of the most urgent admonishings\r\nthat he should refrain from all undue exactions and the threat of grave\r\npunishment should he disobey. These frauds, corruption, extortion, and\r\nrapine practised by the governor were so grave, continuous and general,\r\nstated the duke in his manifesto, that “there is no city, country-side,\r\nor castle, nor any place in all Romagna, nor officer or minister of\r\nthe duke’s, who does not know of these abuses; and, amongst others,\r\nthe famine of wheat occasioned by the traffic which he held against our\r\nexpress prohibition, sending out such quantities as would abundantly\r\nhave sufficed for the people and the army.”\r\n\r\nHe concludes with assurances of his intention that, in the future, they\r\nshall be ruled with justice and integrity, and he urges all who may\r\nhave charges to prefer against the said governor to bring them forward\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nIt was freely rumoured that the charges against Ramiro by no means ended\r\nthere, and in Bologna--and from Bologna the truth of such a matter might\r\nwell transpire, all things considered--it was openly said that Ramiro\r\nhad been in secret treaty with the Bentivogli, Orsini, and Vitelli,\r\nagainst the Duke of Valentinois: “Aveva provixione da Messer Zoane\r\nBentivogli e da Orsini e Vitelozo contro el duca,” writes Fileno della\r\nTuate, who, it will be borne in mind, was no friend of the Borgia, and\r\nwould be at no pains to find justification for the duke’s deeds.\r\n\r\nBut of that secret treaty there was, for the moment, no official\r\nmention. Later the rumour of it was to receive the fullest confirmation,\r\nand, together with that, we shall give, in the next chapter, the duke’s\r\nobvious reasons for having kept the matter secret at first. Matter\r\nenough and to spare was there already upon which to dispose of Messer\r\nRamiro de Lorqua and disposed of he was, with the most summary justice.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 26 the first folk to be astir in Cesena\r\nbeheld, in the grey light of that wintry dawn, the body of Ramiro lying\r\nheadless in the square. It was richly dressed, with all his ornaments\r\nupon it, a scarlet cloak about it, and the hands were gloved. On a\r\npike beside the body the black-bearded head was set up to view, and\r\nso remained throughout that day, a terrible display of the swift and\r\npitiless justice of the duke.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli wrote: “The reason of his death is not properly known”\r\n (“non si sa bene la cagione della sua morte”) “beyond the fact that such\r\nwas the pleasure of the prince, who shows us that he can make and unmake\r\nmen according to their deserts.”\r\n\r\nThe Cronica Civitas Faventiae, the Diariurn Caesenate, and the Cronache\r\nForlivese, all express the people’s extreme satisfaction at the deed,\r\nand endorse the charges of brutality against the man which are contained\r\nin Cesare’s letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. “THE BEAUTIFUL STRATAGEM”\r\n\r\n\r\nCesare left Cesena very early on the morning of December 26--the morning\r\nof Ramiro’s execution--and by the 29th he was at Fano, where he received\r\nthe envoys who came from Ancona with protestations of loyalty, as well\r\nas a messenger from Vitellozzo Vitelli, who brought him news of the\r\nsurrender of Sinigaglia. The citadel itself was still being held by\r\nAndrea Doria--the same who was afterwards to become so famous in Genoa;\r\nthis, it was stated, was solely because Doria desired to make surrender\r\nto the duke himself. The Prefectress, Giovanna da Montefeltre, had\r\nalready departed from the city, which she ruled as regent for her\r\neleven-year old boy, and had gone by sea to Venice.\r\n\r\nThe duke returned answer to Vitelli that he would be in Sinigaglia\r\nhimself upon the morrow, and he invited the condottieri to receive him\r\nthere, since he was decided to possess himself of the citadel at once,\r\nwhether Doria chose to surrender it peacefully or not; and that, to\r\nprovide for emergencies, he would bring his artillery with him. Lastly,\r\nVitelli was bidden to prepare quarters within the new town for the\r\ntroops that would accompany Cesare. To do this it was necessary to\r\ndispose the soldiers of Oliverotto da Fermo in the borgo. These were the\r\nonly troops with the condottieri in Sinigaglia; the remainder of their\r\nforces were quartered in the strongholds of the territory at distances\r\nof from five to seven miles of the town.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of that year 1502 Cesare Borgia appeared before\r\nSinigaglia to receive the homage of those men who had used him so\r\ntreacherously, and whom--with the exception of Paolo Orsini--he now\r\nmet face to face for the first time since their rebellion. Here were\r\nFrancesco Orsini, Duke of Gravina, with Paolo and the latter’s son\r\nFabio; here was Oliverotto, the ruffianly Lord of Fermo, who had won his\r\nlordship by the cold-blooded murder of his kinsman, and concerning whom\r\na rumour ran in Rome that Cesare had sworn to choke him with his own\r\nhands; and here was Vitellozzo Vitelli, the arch-traitor of them all.\r\n\r\nGianpaolo Baglioni was absent through illness--a matter less fatal to\r\nhim than was their health to those who were present--and the Cardinal\r\nand Giulio Orsini were in Rome.\r\n\r\nWere these captains mad to suppose that such a man as Cesare Borgia\r\ncould so forget the wrong they had done him, and forgive them in this\r\neasy fashion, exacting no amends? Were they mad to suppose that, after\r\nsuch proofs as they had given him of what manner of faith they kept,\r\nhe would trust them hereafter with their lives to work further mischief\r\nagainst him? (Well might Macchiavelli have marvelled when he beheld\r\nthe terms of the treaty the duke had made with them.) Were they mad to\r\nimagine that one so crafty as Valentinois would so place himself into\r\ntheir hands--the hands of men who had sworn his ruin and death? Truly,\r\nmad they must have been--rendered so by the gods who would destroy them.\r\n\r\nThe tale of that happening is graphically told by the pen of the\r\nadmiring Macchiavelli, who names the affair “Il Bellissimo Inganno.”\r\n That he so named it should suffice us and restrain us from criticisms of\r\nour own, accepting that criticism of his. To us, judged from our modern\r\nstandpoint, the affair of Sinigaglia is the last word in treachery\r\nand iscariotism. But you are here concerned with the standpoint of\r\nthe Cinquecento, and that standpoint Macchiavelli gives you when he\r\ndescribes this business as “the beautiful stratagem.” To offer judgment\r\nin despite of that is to commit a fatuity, which too often already has\r\nbeen committed.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is Macchiavelli’s story of the event:\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 31 Cesare’s army, composed of 10,000 foot\r\nand 3,000 horse,(1) was drawn up on the banks of the River Metauro--some\r\nfive miles from Sinigaglia--in accordance with his orders, awaiting his\r\narrival. He came at daybreak, and immediately ordered forward 200 lances\r\nunder the command of Don Michele da Corella; he bade the foot to march\r\nafter these, and himself brought up the rear with the main body of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 This is Macchiavelli’s report of the forces; but, it appears to be an\r\nexaggeration, for, upon leaving Cesena, Cesare does not appear to have\r\ncommanded more than 10,000 men in all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Sinigaglia, as we have seen, the condottieri had only the troops of\r\nOliverotto--1,000 foot and 150 horse--which had been quartered in the\r\nborgo, and were now drawn up in the market-place, Oliverotto at their\r\nhead, to do honour to the duke.\r\n\r\nAs the horse under Don Michele gained the little river Misa and the\r\nbridge that spanned it, almost directly opposite to the gates of\r\nSinigaglia, their captain halted them and drew them up into two files,\r\nbetween which a lane was opened. Through this the foot went forward\r\nand straight into the town, and after came Cesare himself, a graceful,\r\nyouthful figure, resplendent in full armour at the head of his lances.\r\nTo meet him advanced now the three Orsini and Vitellozzo Vitelli.\r\nMacchiavelli tells us of the latter’s uneasiness, of his premonitions of\r\nevil, and the farewells (all of which Macchiavelli had afterwards heard\r\nreported) which he had taken of his family before coming to Sinigaglia.\r\nProbably these are no more than the stories that grow up about such men\r\nafter such an event as that which was about to happen.\r\n\r\nThe condottieri came unarmed, Vitelli mounted on a mule, wearing a cloak\r\nwith a green lining. In that group he is the only man deserving of any\r\nrespect or pity--a victim of his sense of duty to his family, driven to\r\nhis rebellion and faithlessness to Valentinois by his consuming desire\r\nto avenge his brother’s death upon the Florentines. The others were\r\npoor creatures, incapable even of keeping faith with one another. Paolo\r\nOrsini was actually said to be in secret concert with Valentinois since\r\nhis mission to him at Imola, and to have accepted heavy bribes from him.\r\nOliverotto you have seen at work, making a holocaust of his family and\r\nfriends under the base spur of his cupidity; whilst of the absent ones,\r\nPandolfo Petrucci alone was a man of any steadfastness and honesty.\r\n\r\nThe duke’s reception of them was invested with that gracious\r\nfriendliness of which none knew the art better than did he, intent\r\nupon showing them that the past was forgiven and their offences against\r\nhimself forgotten. As they turned and rode with him through the gates\r\nof Sinigaglia some of the duke’s gentlemen hemmed them about in the\r\npreconcerted manner, lest even now they should be taken with alarm. But\r\nit was all done unostentatiously and with every show of friendliness,\r\nthat no suspicions should be aroused.\r\n\r\nFrom the group Cesare had missed Oliverotto, and as they now approached\r\nthe market-square, where the Tyrant of Fermo sat on his horse at the\r\nhead of his troops, Cesare made a sign with his eyes to Don Michele, the\r\npurport of which was plain to the captain. He rode ahead to suggest to\r\nOhiverotto that this was no time to have his men under arms and out of\r\ntheir lodgings, and to point out to him that, if they were not dismissed\r\nthey would be in danger of having their quarters snatched from them by\r\nthe duke’s men, from which trouble might arise. To this he added that\r\nthe duke was expecting his lordship.\r\n\r\nOliverotto, persuaded, gave the order for the dismissal of his troops,\r\nand the duke, coming up at that moment, called to him. In response\r\nhe went to greet him, and fell in thereafter with the others who were\r\nriding with Valentinois.\r\n\r\nIn amiable conversation with them all, and riding between Vitelli and\r\nFrancesco Orsini, the duke passed from the borgo into the town itself,\r\nand so to the palace, where the condottieri disposed to take their leave\r\nof him. But Cesare was not for parting with them yet; he bade them in\r\nwith him, and they perforce must accept his invitation. Besides, his\r\nmood was so agreeable that surely there could be nought to fear.\r\n\r\nBut scarce were they inside when his manner changed of a sudden, and at\r\na sign from him they were instantly overpowered and arrested by those\r\ngentlemen of his own who were of the party and who came to it well\r\nschooled in what they were to do.\r\n\r\nBuonaccorsi compiled his diary carefully from the letters of\r\nMacchiavelli to the Ten, in so far as this and other affairs are\r\nconcerned; and to Buonaccorsi we must now turn for what immediately\r\nfollows, which is no doubt from Macchiavelli’s second letter of December\r\n31, in which the full details of the affair are given. His first letter\r\nno more than briefly states the happening; the second unfortunately\r\nis missing; so that the above particulars--and some yet to follow--are\r\nculled from the relations which he afterwards penned (“Del modo tenuto,”\r\n etc.), edited, however, by the help of his dispatches at the time in\r\nregard to the causes which led to the affair. Between these and the\r\nactual relation there are some minor discrepancies. Unquestionably the\r\ndispatches are the more reliable, so that, where such discrepancies\r\noccur, the version in the dispatches has been preferred.\r\n\r\nTo turn for a moment to Buonaccorsi, he tells us that, as the Florentine\r\nenvoy (who was, of course, Macchiavelli) following the Duke of\r\nValentinois entered the town later, after the arrest of the condottieri,\r\nand found all uproar and confusion, he repaired straight to the palace\r\nto ascertain the truth. As he approached he met the duke, riding out in\r\nfull armour to quell the rioting and restrain his men, who were by\r\nnow all out of hand and pillaging the city. Cesare, perceiving the\r\nsecretary, reined in and called him.\r\n\r\n“This,” he said, “is what I wanted to tell Monsignor di Volterra\r\n[Soderini] when he came to Urbino, but I could not entrust him with the\r\nsecret. Now that my opportunity has come, I have known very well how to\r\nmake use of it, and I have done a great service to your masters.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that Cesare left him, and, calling his captains about him,\r\nrode down into the town to put an end to the horrors that were being\r\nperpetrated there.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the arrest of the condottieri Cesare had issued orders\r\nto attack the soldiers of Vitelli and Orsini, and to dislodge them from\r\nthe castles of the territory where they were quartered, and similarly\r\nto dislodge Oliverotto’s men and drive them out of Sinigaglia. This had\r\nbeen swiftly accomplished. But the duke’s men were not disposed to leave\r\nmatters at that. Excited by the taste of battle that had been theirs,\r\nthey returned to wreak their fury upon the town, and were proceeding to\r\nput it to sack, directing particular attention to the wealthy quarter\r\noccupied by the Venetian merchants, which is said to have been plundered\r\nby them to the extent of some 20,000 ducats. They would have made an\r\nend of Sinigaglia but for the sudden appearance amongst them of the duke\r\nhimself. He rode through the streets, angrily ordering the pillage to\r\ncease; and, to show how much he was in earnest, with his own hands he\r\ncut down some who were insolent or slow to obey him; thus, before dusk,\r\nhe had restored order and quiet.\r\n\r\nAs for the condottieri, Vitelli and Oliverotto were dealt with that very\r\nnight. There is a story that Oliverotto, seeing that all was lost, drew\r\na dagger and would have put it through his heart to save himself from\r\ndying at the hands of the hangman. If it is true, then that was his last\r\nshow of spirit. He turned craven at the end, and protested tearfully to\r\nhis judges--for a trial was given them--that the fault of all the wrong\r\nwrought against the duke lay with his brother-in-law, Vitellozzo. More\r\nwonderful was it that the grim Vitelli’s courage also should break down\r\nat the end, and that he should beg that the Pope be implored to grant\r\nhim a plenary indulgence and that his answer be awaited.\r\n\r\nBut at dawn--the night having been consumed in their trial--they were\r\nplaced back to back, and so strangled, and their bodies were taken to\r\nthe church of the Misericordia Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe Orsini were not dealt with just yet. They were kept prisoners, and\r\nValentinois would go no further until he should have heard from Rome\r\nthat Giulio Orsini and the powerful cardinal were also under arrest. To\r\nput to death at present the men in his power might be to alarm and so\r\nlose the others. They are right who say that his craft was devilish; but\r\nwhat else was to be expected of the times?\r\n\r\nOn the morrow--January 1, 1503--the duke issued dispatches to the Powers\r\nof Italy giving his account of the deed. It set forth that the Orsini\r\nand their confederates, notwithstanding the pardon accorded them for\r\ntheir first betrayal and revolt, upon learning of the departure of the\r\nFrench lances--and concluding that the duke was thereby weakened, and\r\nleft with only a few followers of no account--had plotted a fresh and\r\nstill greater treachery. Under pretence of assisting him in the\r\ntaking of Sinigaglia, whither it was known that he was going, they had\r\nassembled there in their full strength, but displaying only one-third\r\nof it, and concealing the remainder in the castles of the surrounding\r\ncountry. They had then agreed with the castellan of Sinigaglia, that on\r\nthat night they should attack him on every side of the new town, which,\r\nbeing small, could contain, as they knew, but few of his people. This\r\ntreachery coming to his knowledge, he had been able to forestall it,\r\nand, entering Sinigaglia with all his troops, he had seized the\r\ntraitors and taken the forces of Oliverotto by surprise. He concluded by\r\nexhorting all to render thanks unto God that an end was set to the many\r\ncalamities suffered in Italy in consequence of those malignant ones.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  See this letter in the documents appended to Alvisi’s Cesare Borgia,\r\ndocument 76.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor once Cesare Borgia is heard giving his own side of an affair. But\r\nare the particulars of his version true? Who shall say positively? His\r\nstatement is not by any means contrary to the known facts, although it\r\nsets upon them an explanation rather different to that afforded us by\r\nMacchiavelli. But it is to be remembered that, after all, Macchiavelli\r\nhad to fall back upon the inferences which he drew from what he beheld,\r\nand that there is no scrap of evidence directly to refute any one of\r\nCesare’s statements. There is even confirmation of the statement that\r\nthe condottieri conceived that he was weakened by the departure of the\r\nFrench lances and left with only a few followers of no account. For\r\nMacchiavelli himself dwells upon the artifice with which Cesare broke up\r\nhis forces and disposed of them in comparatively small numbers here and\r\nthere to the end that his full strength should remain concealed; and he\r\nadmires the strategy of that proceeding.\r\n\r\nCertainly the duke’s narrative tends to increase his justification for\r\nacting as he did. But at best it can only increase it, for the actual\r\njustification was always there, and by the light of his epoch it is\r\ndifficult to see how he should be blamed. These men had openly sworn\r\nto have his life, and from what has been seen of them there is little\r\nreason to suppose they would not have kept their word had they but been\r\ngiven the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Cesare’s version, it is well to go back for a moment\r\nto the execution of Ramiro de Lorqua, and to recall the alleged secret\r\nmotives that led to it. Macchiavelli himself was not satisfied that all\r\nwas disclosed, and that the governor’s harshness and dishonesty had been\r\nthe sole causes of the justice done upon him. “The reason of his death\r\nis not properly known,” wrote the Florentine secretary. Another envoy\r\nof that day would have filled his dispatches with the rumours that were\r\ncurrent, with the matters that were being whispered at street corners.\r\nBut Macchiavelli’s habit was to disregard rumours as a rule, knowing\r\ntheir danger--a circumstance which renders his evidence the most\r\nvaluable which we possess.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps permissible to ask: What dark secrets had the torture of\r\nthe cord drawn from Messer Ramiro? Had these informed the duke of the\r\ntrue state of affairs at Sinigaglia, and had the knowledge brought him\r\nstraight from Cesena to deal with the matter?\r\n\r\nThere is justification for these questions, inasmuch as on January 4 the\r\nPope related to Giustiniani--for which see his dispatches--that Ramiro\r\nde Lorqua, being sentenced to death, stated that he desired to inform\r\nthe duke of certain matters, and informed him that he had concerted with\r\nthe Orsini to give the latter the territory of Cesena; but that, as\r\nthis could not now be done, in consequence of Cesare’s treaty with the\r\ncondottieri, Vitelli had arranged to kill the duke, in which design he\r\nhad the concurrence of Oliverotto. They had planned that a crossbow-man\r\nshould shoot the duke as he rode into Sinigaglia, in consequence of\r\nwhich the duke took great care of himself and never put off his armour\r\nuntil the affair was over. Vitellozzo, the Pope said, had confessed\r\nbefore he died that all that Ramiro had told the duke was true, and\r\nat the Consistory of January 6, when the Sacred College begged for\r\nthe release of the old Cardinal Orsini--who had been taken with the\r\nArchbishop of Florence, Giacomo di Santacroce, and Gianbattista da\r\nVirginio--the Pope answered by informing the cardinals of this plot\r\nagainst the duke’s life.\r\n\r\nThese statements by Cesare and his father are perfectly consistent\r\nwith each other and with the events. Yet, for want of independent\r\nconfirmation, they are not to be insisted upon as affording the true\r\nversion--as, of course, the Pope may have urged what he did as a pretext\r\nto justify what was yet to follow.\r\n\r\nIt is readily conceivable that Ramiro, under torture, or in the hope\r\nperhaps of saving his life, may have betrayed the alleged plot to murder\r\nCesare. And it is perfectly consistent with Cesare’s character and with\r\nhis age that he should have entered into a bargain to learn what Ramiro\r\nmight have to disclose, and then have repudiated it and given him to the\r\nexecutioner. If Cesare, under such circumstances as these, had learnt\r\nwhat was contemplated, he would very naturally have kept silent on the\r\nscore of it until he had dealt with the condottieri. To do otherwise\r\nmight be to forewarn them. He was, as Macchiavelli says, a secret man,\r\nand the more dangerous for his closeness, since he never let it be known\r\nwhat he intended until he had executed his designs.\r\n\r\nGuicciardini, of course, has called the Sinigaglia affair a villainy\r\n(“scelleragine”) whilst Fabio Orsini and a nephew of Vitelli’s who\r\nescaped from Sinigaglia and arrived two days later at Perugia, sought to\r\nengage sympathy by means of an extraordinary tale, so alien to all the\r\nfacts--apart from their obvious reasons to lie and provoke resentment\r\nagainst Cesare--as not to be worth citing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE ZENITH\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea Doria did not remain to make formal surrender of the citadel\r\nof Sinigaglia to the duke--for which purpose, be it borne in mind, had\r\nCesare been invited, indirectly, to come to Sinigaglia. He fled during\r\nthe night that saw Vitelli and Oliverotto writhing their last in the\r\nstrangler’s hands. And his flight adds colour to the versions of the\r\naffair that were afforded the world by Cesare and his father. Andrea\r\nDoria, waiting to surrender his trust, had nothing to fear from the\r\nduke, no reason to do anything but remain. Andrea Doria, intriguing\r\nagainst the duke’s life with the condottieri, finding them seized by the\r\nduke, and inferring that all was discovered, had every reason to fly.\r\n\r\nThe citadel made surrender on that New Year’s morning, when Cesare\r\nsummoned it to do so, whilst the troops of the Orsini and Vitelli lodged\r\nin the castles of the territory, being taken unawares, were speedily\r\ndisposed of. So, there being nothing more left to do in Sinigaglia,\r\nCesare once more marshalled his men and set out for Città di\r\nCastello--the tyranny of the Vitelli, which he found undefended and of\r\nwhich he took possession in the name of the Church. Thence he rushed\r\non towards Perugia, for he had word that Guidobaldo of Urbino, Fabio\r\nOrsini, Annibale and Venanzio Varano, and Vitelli’s nephew were\r\nassembled there under the wing of Gianpaolo Baglioni, who, with a\r\nconsiderable condotta at his back, was making big talk of resisting\r\nthe Duke of Romagna and Valentinois. In this, Gianpaolo persevered most\r\nbravely until he had news that the duke was as near as Gualdo, when\r\nprecipitately he fled--leaving his guests to shift for themselves. He\r\nhad remembered, perhaps, at the last moment how narrow an escape he\r\nhad had of it at Sinigaglia, and he repaired to Siena to join Pandolfo\r\nPetrucci, who had been equally fortunate in that connection.\r\n\r\nTo meet the advancing and irresistible duke came ambassadors from\r\nPerugia with smooth words of welcome, the offer of the city, and their\r\nthanks for his having delivered them of the tyrants that oppressed\r\nthem; and there is not the slightest cause to suppose that this was mere\r\nsycophancy, for a more bloody, murderous crew than these Baglioni--whose\r\nfeuds not only with the rival family of the Oddi, but among their\r\nvery selves, had more than once embrued the walls of that city in the\r\nhills--it would be difficult to find in Italy, or anywhere in Europe.\r\nThe history of the Baglioni is one record of slaughter. Under their\r\nrule in Perugia human blood seems commonly to have flowed anywhere more\r\nfreely than in human veins. It is no matter for wonder that the people\r\nsent their ambassador to thank Cesare for having delivered them from the\r\nyoke that had oppressed them.\r\n\r\nPerugia having rendered him her oath of fealty, the duke left her\r\nhis secretary, Agabito Gherardi, as his commissioner, whilst sending\r\nVincenzo Calmeta to Fermo--Oliverotto’s tyranny--another State which was\r\nvery fervent in the thanks it expressed for this deliverance.\r\n\r\nScarcely was Cesare gone from Perugia when into the hands of his people\r\nfell the person of the Lady Panthasilea Baglioni d’Alviano--the wife of\r\nthe famous Venetian condottiero Bartolomeo d’Alviano--and they, aware of\r\nthe feelings prevailing between their lord and the Government of Venice,\r\nbethought them that here was a valuable hostage. So they shut her up\r\nin the Castle of Todi, together with her children and the women who had\r\nbeen with her when she was taken.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Dorotea Caracciolo, the rumour is instantly put about\r\nthat it was Cesare who had seized her, that he had taken her to his\r\ncamp, and that this poor woman had fallen a prey to that lustful\r\nmonster. So--and in some such words--ran the story, and such a hold did\r\nit take upon folks’ credulity that we see Piero di Bibieno before the\r\nCouncil of Ten, laying a more or less formal charge against the duke in\r\nrather broader terms than are here set down. So much, few of those\r\nwho have repeated his story omit to tell you. But for some reason, not\r\nobviously apparent, they do not think it worth while to add that the\r\nDoge himself--better informed, it is clear, for he speaks with finality\r\nin the matter--reproved him by denying the rumour and definitely stating\r\nthat it was not true, as you may read in the Diary of Marino Sanuto.\r\nThat same diary shows you the husband--a person of great consequence in\r\nVenice--before the Council, clamouring for the enlargement of his lady;\r\nyet never once does he mention the name of Valentinois. The Council of\r\nTen sends an envoy to wait upon the Pope; and the Pope expresses his\r\nprofound regret and his esteem for Alviano, and informs the envoy that\r\nhe is writing to Valentinois to demand her instant release--in fact,\r\nshows the envoy the letter.\r\n\r\nTo that same letter the duke replied on January 29 that he had known\r\nnothing of the matter until this communication reached him; that he has\r\nsince ascertained that the lady was indeed captured and that she has\r\nsince been detained in the Castle of Todi with all the consideration\r\ndue to her rank; and that, immediately upon ascertaining this he had\r\ncommanded that she should be set at liberty, which was done.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Lady Panthasilea returned unharmed to her husband.\r\n\r\nIn Assisi Cesare received the Florentine ambassador Salviati, who came\r\nto congratulate the duke upon the affair of Sinigaglia and to replace\r\nMacchiavelli--the latter having been ordered home again. Congratulations\r\nindeed were addressed to him by all those Powers that had received his\r\nofficial intimation of the event. Amongst these were the felicitations\r\nof the beautiful and accomplished Isabella d’Este, Marchioness of\r\nGonzaga--whose relations with him were ever of the friendliest, even\r\nwhen Faenza by its bravery evoked her pity--and with these she sent him,\r\nfor the coming carnival, a present of a hundred masks of rare variety\r\nand singular beauty, because she opined that “after the fatigues he had\r\nsuffered in these glorious enterprises, he would desire to contrive for\r\nsome recreation.”\r\n\r\nHere in Assisi, too, he received the Siennese envoys who came to wait\r\nupon him, and he demanded that, out of respect for the King of France,\r\nthey should drive out Pandolfo Petrucci from Siena. For, to use his\r\nown words, “having deprived his enemies of their weapons, he would now\r\ndeprive them of their brain,” by which he paid Petrucci the compliment\r\nof accounting him the “brain” of all that had been attempted against\r\nhim. To show the Siennese how much he was in earnest, he leaves all\r\nbaggage and stores at Assisi, and, unhampered, makes one of his sudden\r\nswoops towards Siena, pausing on January 13 at Castel della Pieve to\r\npublish, at last, his treaty with Bentivogli. The latter being\r\nnow sincere, no doubt out of fear of the consequences of further\r\ninsincerity, at once sends Cesare 30 lances and 100 arbalisters under\r\nthe command of Antonio della Volta.\r\n\r\nIt was there in Assisi, on the morning of striking his camp again, that\r\nCesare completed the work that had been begun at Sinigaglia by having\r\nPaolo Orsini and the Duke of Gravina strangled. There was no cause\r\nto delay the matter longer. He had word from Rome of the capture of\r\nCardinal Orsini, of Gianbattista da Virginio, of Giacomo di Santacroce,\r\nand Rinaldo Orsini, Archbishop of Florence.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, Pandolfo Petrucci being still in Siena, and Cesare’s\r\npatience exhausted, he issued an ultimatum from his camp at Sartiano in\r\nwhich he declared that if, within twenty-four hours, Petrucci had not\r\nbeen expelled from the city, he would loose his soldiers upon Siena to\r\ndevastate the territory, and would treat every inhabitant “as a Pandolfo\r\nand an enemy.”\r\n\r\nSiena judged it well to bow before that threatening command, and Cesare,\r\nseeing himself obeyed, was free to depart to Rome, whither the Pope had\r\nrecalled him and where work awaited him. He was required to make an end\r\nof the resistance of the barons, a task which had been entrusted to his\r\nbrother Giuffredo, but which the latter had been unable to carry out.\r\n\r\nIn this matter Cesare and his father are said to have violently\r\ndisagreed, and it is reported that high words flew between them; for\r\nCesare--who looked ahead and had his own future to consider, which\r\nshould extend beyond the lifetime of Alexander VI--would not move\r\nagainst Silvio Savelli in Palombara, nor Gian Giordano in Bracciano,\r\nalleging, as his reason for the latter forbearance, that Gian Giordano,\r\nbeing a knight of St. Michael like himself, he was inhibited by the\r\nterms of that knighthood from levying war upon him. To that he adhered,\r\nwhilst disposing, however, to lay siege to Ceri, where Giulio and\r\nGiovanni Orsini had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Cardinal Gianbattista Orsini had breathed his last\r\nin the Castle of Sant’ Angelo.\r\n\r\nSoderini had written ironically to Florence on February 15: “Cardinal\r\nOrsini, in prison, shows signs of frenzy. I leave your Sublimities\r\nto conclude, in your wisdom, the judgment that is formed of such an\r\nillness.”\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until a week later--on February 22--that he\r\nsuccumbed, when the cry of “Poison!” grew so loud and general that the\r\nPope ordered the cardinal’s body to be carried on a bier with the face\r\nexposed, that all the world might see its calm and the absence of such\r\nstains as were believed usually to accompany venenation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the opinion spread that he had been poisoned--and the\r\npoisoning of Cardinal Orsini has been included in the long list of the\r\nCrimes of the Borgias with which we have been entertained. That the\r\nrumour should have spread is not in the least wonderful, considering\r\nin what bad odour were the Orsini at the Vatican just then, and--be it\r\nremembered--what provocation they had given. Although Valentinois dubbed\r\nPandolfo Petrucci the “brain” of the conspiracy against him, the real\r\nguiding spirit, there can be little doubt, was this Cardinal Orsini,\r\nin whose stronghold at Magione the diet had met to plot Valentinois’s\r\nruin--the ruin of the Gonfalonier of the Church, and the fresh\r\nalienation from the Holy See of the tyrannies which it claimed for its\r\nown, and which at great cost had been recovered to it.\r\n\r\nAgainst the Pope, considered as a temporal ruler, that was treason\r\nin the highest degree, and punishable by death; and, assuming that\r\nAlexander did cause the death of Cardinal Orsini, the only just censure\r\nthat could fall upon him for the deed concerns the means employed. Yet\r\neven against that it might be urged that thus was the dignity of the\r\npurple saved the dishonouring touch of the hangman’s hands.\r\n\r\nSome six weeks later--on April 10--died Giovanni Michieli, Cardinal of\r\nSant’ Angelo, and Giustiniani, the Venetian ambassador, wrote to his\r\nGovernment that the cardinal had been ill for only two days, and\r\nthat his illness had been attended by violent sickness. This--and the\r\nreticence of it--was no doubt intended to arouse the suspicion that the\r\ncardinal had been poisoned. Giustiniani adds that Michieli’s house was\r\nstripped that very night by the Pope, who profited thereby to the extent\r\nof some 150,000 ducats, besides plate and other valuables; and this was\r\nintended to show an indecent eagerness on the Pope’s part to possess\r\nhimself of that which by the cardinal’s death he inherited, whereas, in\r\ntruth, the measure would be one of wise precaution against the customary\r\ndanger of pillage by the mob.\r\n\r\nBut in March of the year 1504, under the pontificate of Julius\r\nII (Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere) a subdeacon, named Asquino de\r\nColloredo, was arrested for defaming the dead cardinal (“interfector\r\nbone memorie Cardinalis S. Angeli”).(1) What other suspicions were\r\nentertained against him, what other revelations it was hoped to extract\r\nfrom him, cannot be said; but Asquino was put to the question, to\r\nthe usual accompaniment of the torture of the cord, and under this he\r\nconfessed that he had poisoned Cardinal Michieli, constrained to it\r\nby Pope Alexander VI and the Duke of Valentinois, against his will and\r\nwithout reward (“verumtamen non voluisse et pecunias non habuisse”).\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Burchard’s Diarium, March 6, 1504.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow if Asquino defamed the memory of Cardinal Michieli it seems to\r\nfollow naturally that he had hated the cardinal; and, if we know that he\r\nhated him, we need not marvel that, out of that hatred, he poisoned him.\r\nBut something must have been suspected as a motive for his arrest\r\nin addition to the slanders he was uttering, otherwise how came\r\nthe questions put to him to be directed so as to wring from him the\r\nconfession that he had poisoned the cardinal? If you choose to believe\r\nhis further statement that he was constrained to it by Pope Alexander\r\nand the Duke of Valentinois, you are, of course, at liberty to do so.\r\nBut you will do well first to determine precisely what degree of credit\r\nsuch a man might be worth when seeking to extenuate a fault admitted\r\nunder pressure of the torture--and offering the extenuation likeliest to\r\ngain him the favour of the della Rovere Pope, whose life’s task--as we\r\nshall see--was the defamation of the hated Borgias. You will also do\r\nwell closely to examine the last part of his confession--that he was\r\nconstrained to it “against his will and without reward.” Would the deed\r\nhave been so very much against the will of one who went about publishing\r\nhis hatred of the dead cardinal by the slanders he emitted?\r\n\r\nUpon such evidence as that the accusation of the Pope’s murder of\r\nCardinal Michieli has been definitely established--and it must be\r\nadmitted that it is, if anything, rather more evidence than is usually\r\nforthcoming of the vampirism and atrocities alleged against him.\r\n\r\nGiustiniani, writing to his Government in the spring of 1503, informs\r\nthe Council of Ten that it is the Pope’s way to fatten his cardinals\r\nbefore disposing of them--that is to say, enriching them before\r\npoisoning them, that he may inherit their possessions. It was a wild and\r\nsweeping statement, dictated by political animus, and it has since grown\r\nto proportions more monstrous than the original. You may read usque\r\nad nauseam of the Pope and Cesare’s constant practice of poisoning\r\ncardinals who had grown rich, for the purpose of seizing their\r\npossessions, and you are very naturally filled with horror at so much\r\nand such abominable turpitude. In this matter, assertion--coupled with\r\nwhorling periods of vituperation--have ever been considered by the\r\naccusers all that was necessary to establish the accusations. It has\r\nnever, for instance, been considered necessary to cite the names of the\r\ncardinals composing that regiment of victims. That, of course, would be\r\nto challenge easy refutation of the wholesale charge; and refutation is\r\nnot desired by those who prefer the sensational manner.\r\n\r\nThe omission may, in part at least, be repaired by giving a list of\r\nthe cardinals who died during the eleven years of the pontificate\r\nof Alexander VI. Those deaths, in eleven years, number\r\ntwenty-one--representing, incidentally, a percentage that compares\r\nfavourably with any other eleven years of any other pontificate or\r\npontificates. They are:\r\n\r\n     Ardicino della Porta   .   .     In 1493, at Rome\r\n     Giovanni de’Conti.   .   .       In 1493, at Rome\r\n     Domenico della Rovere  .   .

In 1503, at Rome\r\n     Giovanni Michieli.   .   .       In 1503, at Rome\r\n     Giovanni Borgia (Seniore).   .   In 1503, at Rome\r\n     Federico Casimir .   .   .       In 1503, in Poland\r\n\r\nNow, search as you will, not only such contemporary records as diaries,\r\nchronicles, and dispatches from ambassadors in Rome during that period\r\nof eleven years but also subsequent writings compiled from them, and you\r\nshall find no breath of scandal attaching to the death of seventeen of\r\nthose cardinals, no suggestion that they died other than natural deaths.\r\n\r\nFour remain: Cardinals Giovanni Borgia (Giuniore), Gianbattista Ferrari\r\n(Cardinal of Modena), Gianbattista Orsini, and Giovanni Michieli, all of\r\nwhom the Pope and Cesare have, more or less persistently, been accused\r\nof poisoning.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Borgia’s death at Fossombrone has been dealt with at length\r\nin its proper place, and it has been shown how utterly malicious and\r\ngroundless was the accusation.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Michieli’s is the case that has just been reviewed, and\r\ntouching which you may form your own conclusions.\r\n\r\nGianbattista Orsini’s also has been examined. It rests upon rumour; but\r\neven if that rumour be true, it is unfair to consider the deed in any\r\nbut the light of a political execution.\r\n\r\nThere remains the case of the Cardinal of Modena, a man who had amassed\r\nenormous wealth in the most questionable manner, and who was universally\r\nexecrated. The epigrams upon his death, in the form of epitaphs, dealt\r\nmost terribly with “his ignominious memory”--as Burchard has it. Of\r\nthese the Master of Ceremonies collected upwards of a score, which he\r\ngives in his Diarium. Let one suffice here as a fair example of the\r\nrest, the one that has it that the earth has the cardinal’s body, the\r\nbull (i.e. the Borgia) his wealth, and hell his soul.\r\n\r\n     “Hac Janus Baptista jacet Ferrarius urna,\r\n     Terra habuit corpus, Bos bona, Styx animam.”\r\n\r\nThe only absolutely contemporary suggestion of his having been poisoned\r\nemanated from the pen of that same Giustiniani. He wrote to the Venetian\r\nSenate to announce the cardinal’s death on July 20. In his letter he\r\nrelates how his benefices were immediately distributed, and how the\r\nlion’s share fell to the cardinal’s secretary, Sebastiano Pinzone, and\r\nthat it was said (“é fama”) that this man had received them as the price\r\nof blood (“in premium sanguinis”), “since it is held, from many evident\r\nsigns, that the cardinal died from poison” (“ex veneno”).\r\n\r\nAlready on the 11th he had written: “The Cardinal of Modena lies ill,\r\nwith little hope of recovery. Poison is suspected” (“si dubita di\r\nveleno”).\r\n\r\nThat was penned on the eighth day of the cardinal’s sickness, for he was\r\ntaken ill on the 3rd--as Burchard shows. Burchard, further, lays before\r\nus the whole course of the illness; tells us how, from the beginning,\r\nthe cardinal refused to be bled or to take medicine of any kind, tells\r\nus explicitly and positively that the cardinal was suffering from a\r\ncertain fever--so prevalent and deadly in Rome during the months of\r\nJuly and August; he informs us that, on the 11th (the day on which\r\nGiustiniani wrote the above-cited dispatch), the fever abated, to\r\nreturn on the 16th. He was attended (Burchard continues) by many able\r\nphysicians, who strove to induce him to take their medicines; but he\r\nrefused persistently until the following day, when he accepted a small\r\nproportion of the doses proposed. On July 20--after an illness of\r\nseventeen days--he finally expired.\r\n\r\nThose entries in the diary of the Master of Ceremonies constitute an\r\nincontrovertible document, an irrefutable testimony against the charges\r\nof poisoning when taken in conjunction with the evidence of fact\r\nafforded by the length of the illness.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, under date of November 20, 1504 (under the pontificate\r\nof Julius II), there is the following entry:\r\n\r\n“Sentence was pronounced in the ‘Ruota’ against Sebastiano Pinzone,\r\napostolic scribe, contumaciously absent, and he was deprived of all\r\nbenefices and offices in that he had caused the death of the Cardinal of\r\nModena, his patron, who had raised him from the dust.”\r\n\r\nBut not even that can shake the conviction that must leap to every\r\nhonest mind from following the entries in the diary contemporary with\r\nthe cardinal’s decease. They are too circumstantial and conclusive to\r\nbe overthrown by this recorded sentence of the Ruota two years later\r\nagainst a man who was not even present to defend himself. Besides, it is\r\nnecessary to discriminate. Burchard is not stating opinions of his own\r\nwhen he writes “in that he caused the death of the Cardinal of Modena,”\r\n etc.; he is simply--and obviously--recording the finding of the Tribunal\r\nof the Ruota, without comment of his own. Lastly, it is as well to\r\nobserve that in that verdict against Pinzone--of doubtful justice as it\r\nis--there is no mention made of the Borgias.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings instituted against Sebastiano Pinzone were of a piece\r\nwith those instituted against Asquino de Colloredo and others yet to\r\nbe considered; they were set on foot by Giuliano della Rovere--that\r\nimplacable enemy of the House of Borgia--when he became Pope, for the\r\npurpose of heaping ignominy upon the family of his predecessor. But that\r\nshall be further dealt with presently.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the unceasing growth of Borgia history is afforded\r\nin connection with this Sebastiano Pinzone by Dr. Jacob Burckhardt (in\r\nDer Cultur der Renaissance in Italien) who, in the course of the usual\r\nsweeping diatribe against Cesare, mentions “Michele da Corella, his\r\nstrangler, and Sebastiano Pinzone, his poisoner.” It is an amazing\r\nstatement; for, whilst obviously leaning upon Giustiniani’s dispatch\r\nfor the presumption that Pinzone was a poisoner at all, he ignores the\r\nstatement contained in it that Pinzone was the secretary and favourite\r\nof Cardinal Ferrari, nor troubles to ascertain that the man was never in\r\nCesare Borgia’s service at all, nor is ever once mentioned anywhere as\r\nconnected in any capacity whatever with the duke. Dr. Burckhardt felt,\r\nno doubt, the necessity of linking Pinzone to the Borgias, that the\r\nalleged guilt of the former may recoil upon the latter, and so he\r\naccomplished it in this facile and irresponsible manner.\r\n\r\nNow, notwithstanding the full and circumstantial evidence afforded by\r\nBurchard’s Diarium of the Cardinal of Modena’s death of a tertian\r\nfever, the German scholar Gregorovius does not hesitate to write of this\r\ncardinal’s death: “It is certain that it was due to their [the Borgias']\r\ninfallible white powders.”\r\n\r\nOh the art of writing history in sweeping statements to support a\r\npreconceived point of view! Oh that white powder of the Borgias!\r\n\r\nGiovio tells us all about it. Cantarella, he calls it--Cantharides. Why\r\nCantarella? Possibly because it is a pleasing, mellifluous word that\r\nwill help a sentence hang together smoothly; possibly because the\r\nnotorious aphrodisiac properties of that drug suggested it to Giovio as\r\njust the poison to be kept handy by folk addicted to the pursuits which\r\nhe and others attribute to the Borgias. Can you surmise any better\r\nreason? For observe that Giovio describes the Cantarella for you--a\r\nblunder of his which gives the lie to his statement. “A white powder of\r\na faint and not unpleasing savour,” says he; and that, as you know, is\r\nnothing like cantharides, which is green, intensely acrid, and burning.\r\nYet who cares for such discrepancies? Who will ever question anything\r\nthat is uttered against a Borgia? “Cantarella--a white powder of a faint\r\nand not unpleasing savour,” answers excellently the steady purpose of\r\nsupporting a defamation and pandering to the tastes of those who like\r\nsensations in their reading--and so, from pen to pen, from book to book\r\nit leaps, as unchallenged as it is impossible.\r\n\r\nWhilst Cesare’s troops were engaged in laying siege to Ceri, and, by\r\nengines contrived by Leonardo da Vinci, pressing the defenders so\r\nsorely that at the end of a month’s resistance they surrendered with\r\nsafe-conduct, the inimical and ever-jealous Venetians in the north were\r\nstirring up what trouble they could. Chafing under the restraint of\r\nFrance, they but sought a pretext that should justify them in the eyes\r\nof Louis for making war upon Cesare, and when presently envoys came\r\nto lay before the Pope the grievance of the Republic at the pillage by\r\nBorgian soldiery of the Venetian traders in Sinigaglia, Cesare had no\r\ndelusions concerning their disposition towards himself.\r\n\r\nGrowing uneasy lest they should make this a reason for assailing his\r\nfrontiers, he sent orders north recommending vigilance and instructing\r\nhis officers to deal severely with all enemies of his State, whilst he\r\nproceeded to complete the provisions for the government of the Romagna.\r\nTo replace the Governor-General he appointed four seneschals: Cristoforo\r\ndella Torre for Forli, Faenza and Imola; Hieronimo Bonadies for Cesena,\r\nRimini, and Pesaro; Andrea Cossa for Fano, Sinigaglia, Fossombrone, and\r\nPergola; and Pedro Ramires for the duchy of Urbino. This last was to\r\nfind a deal of work for his hands; for Urbino was not yet submissive,\r\nMajolo and S. Leo still holding for Guidobaldo.\r\n\r\nRamires began by reducing Majolo, and then proceeded to lay siege to\r\nS. Leo. But the Castellan--one Lattanzio--encouraged by the assurances\r\ngiven him that the Venetians would render Guidobaldo assistance to\r\nreconquer his dominions, resisted stubbornly, and was not brought to\r\nsurrender until the end of June, after having held the castle for six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIf Venice was jealous and hostile in the north, Florence was scarcely\r\nless so in mid-Italy--though perhaps with rather more justification, for\r\nCesare’s growing power and boundless ambition kept the latter Republic\r\nin perpetual fear of being absorbed into his dominions--into that\r\nkingdom which it was his ultimate aim to found. There can be little\r\ndoubt that Francesco da Narni, who appeared in Tuscany early in the\r\nMarch of that year, coming from the French Court for the purpose of\r\narranging a league of Florence, Bologna, Siena, and Lucca--the four\r\nStates more or less under French protection--had been besought by\r\nFlorence, to the obvious end that these four States, united, might\r\ninter-defend themselves against Valentinois. And Florence even went\r\nso far as to avail herself of this to the extent of restoring Pandolfo\r\nPetrucci to the lordship of Siena--preferring even this avowed enemy to\r\nthe fearful Valentinois. Thus came about Petrucci’s restoration towards\r\nthe end of March, despite the fact that the Siennese were divided on the\r\nsubject of his return.\r\n\r\nWith the single exception of Camerino, where disturbances still\r\ncontinued, all was quiet in the States of the Church by that summer of\r\n1503.\r\n\r\nThis desirable state of things had been achieved by Cesare’s wise and\r\nliberal government, which also sufficed to ensure its continuance.\r\n\r\nHe had successfully combated the threatened famine by importing grain\r\nfrom Sicily. To Sinigaglia--his latest conquest--he had accorded, as to\r\nthe other subjected States, the privilege of appointing her own native\r\nofficials, with, of course, the exception of the Podestà (who never\r\ncould be a native of any place where he dispensed justice) and the\r\nCastellan. In Cesena a liberal justice was measured out by the Tribunal\r\nof the Ruota, which Cesare had instituted there, equipping it with the\r\nbest jurisconsults of the Romagna.\r\n\r\nIn Rome he proceeded to a military organization on a new basis, and\r\nwith a thoroughness never before seen in Italy--or elsewhere, for that\r\nmatter--but which was thereafter the example all sought to copy. We have\r\nseen him issuing an edict that every house in the Romagna should furnish\r\nhim one man-at-arms to serve him when necessary. The men so levied were\r\nunder obligation to repair to the market-place of their native town when\r\nsummoned thither by the ringing of the bells, and it was estimated that\r\nthis method of conscription would yield him six or seven thousand men,\r\nwho could be mobilized in a couple of days. He increased the number\r\nof arquebusiers, appreciating the power and value of a weapon\r\nwhich--although invented nearly a century earlier--was still regarded\r\nwith suspicion. He was also the inventor of the military uniform,\r\nputting his soldiers into a livery of his own, and causing his\r\nmen-at-arms to wear over their armour a smock, quartered red and\r\nyellow with the name CESARE lettered on the breast and back, whilst the\r\ngentlemen of his guard wore surcoats of his colours in gold brocade and\r\ncrimson velvet.\r\n\r\nHe continued to levy troops and to arm them, and it is scarcely\r\nover-stating the case to say that hardly a tyrant of the Romagna would\r\nhave dared to do so much for fear of the weapons being turned against\r\nhimself. Cesare knew no such fear. He enjoyed a loyalty from the people\r\nhe had subjected which was almost unprecedented in Italy. The very\r\nofficers he placed in command of the troops of his levying were, for the\r\nmost part, natives of the Romagna. Is there no inference concerning him\r\nto be drawn from that!\r\n\r\nFor every man in his service Cesare ordered a back-and-breast and\r\nheadpiece of steel, and the armourers’ shops of Brescia rang busily that\r\nsummer with the clang of metal upon metal, as that defensive armour for\r\nCesare’s troops was being forged. At the same time the foundries were\r\nturning out fresh cannon in that season which saw Cesare at the very\r\nheight and zenith of his power, although he himself may not have\r\naccounted that, as yet, he was further than at the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut the catastrophe that was to hurl him irretrievably from the eminence\r\nto which in three short years he had climbed was approaching with\r\nstealthy, relentless foot, and was even now upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV. THE BULL CADENT\r\n\r\n“Cesar Borgia che era della gente Per armi e per virtú tenuto un sole,\r\nMancar dovendo andó dove andar sole Phebo, verso la sera, al Occidente.\r\n\r\n“Girolamo Casio--Epitaffi.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunate Naples was a battle-field once more. France and Spain were\r\nengaged there in a war whose details belong elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo the aid of France, which was hard beset and with whose arms things\r\nwere going none too well, Cesare was summoned to fulfil the obligations\r\nunder which he was placed by virtue of his treaty with King Louis.\r\n\r\nRumours were rife that he was negotiating secretly with Gonzalo de\r\nCordoba, the Great Captain, and the truth of whether or not he was\r\nguilty of so base a treachery has never been discovered. These rumours\r\nhad been abroad since May, and, if not arising out of, they were\r\ncertainly stimulated by, an edict published by Valentinois concerning\r\nthe papal chamberlain, Francesco Troche. In this edict Cesare enjoined\r\nall subjects of the Holy See to arrest, wherever found, this man who had\r\nfled from Rome, and whose flight “was concerned with something against\r\nthe honour of the King of France.”\r\n\r\nFrancesco Troche had been Alexander’s confidential chamberlain and\r\nsecretary; he had been a diligent servant of the House of Borgia, and\r\nwhen in France had acted as a spy for Valentinois, keeping the duke\r\nsupplied with valuable information at a critical time, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nVillari says of him that he was “one of the Borgias’ most trusted\r\nassassins.” That he has never been so much as alleged to have murdered\r\nanyone does not signify. He was a servant--a trusted servant--of\r\nthe Borgias; therefore the title of “assassin” is, ipso facto, to be\r\nbestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nThe flight of a man holding such an intimate position as Troche’s was\r\nnaturally a subject of much speculation and gossip, but a matter upon\r\nwhich there was no knowledge. Valentinois was ever secret. In common\r\nwith his father--though hardly in so marked a degree, and if we except\r\nthe case of the scurrilous Letter to Silvio Savelli--he showed a\r\ncontemptuous indifference to public opinion on the whole which is\r\ninvested almost with a certain greatness. At least it is rarely other\r\nthan with greatness that we find such an indifference associated. It was\r\nnot for him to take the world into his confidence in matters with which\r\nthe world was not concerned. Let the scandalmongers draw what inferences\r\nthey pleased. It was a lofty and dignified procedure, but one that was\r\nfraught with peril; and the Borgias have never ceased to pay the price\r\nof that excessive dignity of reserve. For tongues must be wagging, and,\r\nwhere knowledge is lacking, speculation will soon usurp its place, and\r\npresently be invested with all the authority of “fact.”\r\n\r\nOut of surmises touching that matter “which concerned the honour of the\r\nKing of France” grew presently--and contradictorily--the rumour that\r\nTroche was gone to betray to France Valentinois’s intention of going\r\nover to the Spanish side. A motive was certainly required to account for\r\nTroche’s action; but the invention of motives does not appear ever to\r\nhave troubled the Cinquecentist.\r\n\r\nIt was now said that Troche was enraged at having been omitted from the\r\nlist of cardinals to be created at the forthcoming Consistory. It is\r\nall mystery, even to the end he made; for, whereas some said that, after\r\nbeing seized on board a ship that was bound for Corsica, Troche in his\r\ndespair threw himself overboard and was drowned, others reported that he\r\nwas brought back to Rome and strangled in a prison in Trastevere.\r\n\r\nThe following questions crave answer:\r\n\r\nIf it was Troche’s design to betray such a treachery of the Borgias\r\nagainst France, what was he doing on board a vessel bound for Corsica\r\na fortnight after his flight from Rome? Would not his proper goal have\r\nbeen the French camp in Naples, which he could have reached in a quarter\r\nof that time, and where not only could he have vented his desire for\r\nvengeance by betraying Alexander and Valentinois, but he could further\r\nhave found complete protection from pursuit?\r\n\r\nIt is idle and unprofitable to dwell further upon the end of Francesco\r\nTroche. The matter is a complete mystery, and whilst theory is very well\r\nas theory, it is dangerous to cause it to fill the place of fact.\r\n\r\nTroche was drowned or was strangled as a consequence of his having fled\r\nout of motives that were “against the honour of the King of France.” And\r\nstraightway the rumour spread of Valentinois’s intended treachery, and\r\nthe rumour was kept alive and swelled by Venice and Florence in pursuit\r\nof their never-ceasing policy of discrediting Cesare with King Louis, to\r\nthe end that they might encompass his expedient ruin.\r\n\r\nThe lie was given to them to no small extent by the Pope, when, in\r\nthe Consistory of July 28, he announced Cesare’s departure to join the\r\nFrench army in Naples with five hundred horse and two thousand foot\r\nassembled for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFor this Cesare made now his preparations, and on the eve of departure\r\nhe went with his father--on the evening of August 5--to sup at the villa\r\nof Cardinal Adriano Corneto, outside Rome.\r\n\r\nOnce before we have seen him supping at a villa of the Suburra on the\r\neve of setting out for Naples, and we know the tragedy that followed--a\r\ntragedy which he has been accused of having brought about. Here again,\r\nin a villa of the Suburra, at a supper on the eve of setting out for\r\nNaples, Death was the unseen guest.\r\n\r\nThey stayed late at the vineyard of Cardinal Corneto, enjoying\r\nthe treacherous cool of the evening, breathing the death that was\r\nomnipresent in Rome that summer, the pestilential fever which had\r\nsmitten Cardinal Giovanni Borgia (Seniore) on the 1st of that month, and\r\nof which men were dying every day in the most alarming numbers.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Saturday 12, Burchard tells us, the Pope felt ill, and\r\nthat evening he was taken with fever. On the 15th Burchard records that\r\nhe was bled, thirteen ounces of blood being taken from him. It relieved\r\nhim somewhat, and, seeking distraction, he bade some of the cardinals to\r\ncome and sit by his bed and play at cards.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cesare was also stricken, and in him the fever raged so\r\nfierce and violently that he had himself immersed to the neck in a huge\r\njar of ice-cold water--a drastic treatment in consequence of which he\r\ncame to shed all the skin from his body.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th the Pope was much worse, and on the 18th, the end being at\r\nhand, he was confessed by the Bishop of Culm, who administered Extreme\r\nUnction, and that evening he died.\r\n\r\nThat, beyond all manner of question, is the true story of the passing of\r\nAlexander VI, as revealed by the Diarium of Burchard, by the testimony\r\nof the physician who attended him, and by the dispatches of the\r\nVenetian, Ferrarese, and Florentine ambassadors. At this time of day it\r\nis accepted by all serious historians, compelled to it by the burden of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe ambassador of Ferrara had written to Duke Ercole, on August 14, that\r\nit was no wonder the Pope and the duke were ill, as nearly everybody in\r\nRome was ill as a consequence of the bad air (“Per la mala condictione\r\nde aere”).\r\n\r\nCardinal Soderini was also stricken with the fever, whilst Corneto was\r\ntaken ill on the day after that supper-party, and, like Cesare, is said\r\nto have shed all the skin of his body before he recovered.\r\n\r\nEven Villari and Gregorovius, so unrestrained when writing of the\r\nBorgias, discard the extraordinary and utterly unwarranted stories of\r\nGuicciardini, Giovio, and Bembo, which will presently be considered.\r\nGregorovius does this with a reluctance that is almost amusing, and\r\nwith many a fond, regretful, backward glance--so very apparent in his\r\nmanner--at the tale of villainy as told by Guicciardini and the others,\r\nwhich the German scholar would have adopted but that he dared not for\r\nhis credit’s sake. This is not stated on mere assumption. It is obvious\r\nto any one who reads Gregorovius’s histories.\r\n\r\nBurchard tells us--as certainly matter for comment--that, during his\r\nlast illness, Alexander never once asked for Cesare nor ever once\r\nmentioned the name of Lucrezia. So far as Cesare is concerned, the Pope\r\nknew, no doubt, that he was ill and bedridden, for all that the gravity\r\nof the duke’s condition would, probably, have been concealed from\r\nhim. That he should not have mentioned Lucrezia--nor, we suppose,\r\nGiuffredo--is remarkable. Did he, with the hand of Death already upon\r\nhim, reproach himself with this paternity which, however usual and\r\ncommonplace in priests of all degrees, was none the less a scandal, and\r\nthe more scandalous in a measure as the rank of the offender was higher?\r\nIt may well be that in those last days that sinful, worldly old man\r\nbethought him of the true scope and meaning of Christ’s Vicarship, which\r\nhe had so wantonly abused and dishonoured, and considered that to that\r\nJudge before whom he was summoned to appear the sins of his predecessors\r\nwould be no justification or mitigation of his own. It may well be that,\r\ngrown introspective upon his bed of death, he tardily sought to thrust\r\nfrom his mind the worldly things that had so absorbed it until the\r\nspiritual were forgotten, and had given rise to all the scandal\r\nconcerning him that was spread through Christendom, to the shame and\r\ndishonour of the Church whose champion he should have been.\r\n\r\nThus may it have come to pass that he summoned none of his children in\r\nhis last hours, nor suffered their names to cross his lips.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of his father’s death was brought to Cesare, the duke, all\r\nfever-racked as he was, more dead than living, considered his position\r\nand issued his orders to Michele da Corella, that most faithful of all\r\nhis captains, who so richly shared with Cesare the execration of the\r\nlatter’s enemies.\r\n\r\nOf tears for his father there is no record, just as at no time are we\r\nallowed to see that stern spirit giving way to any emotion, conceiving\r\nany affection, or working ever for the good of any but himself. Besides,\r\nin such an hour as this, the consciousness of the danger in which\r\nhe stood by virtue of the Pope’s death and his own most inopportune\r\nsickness, which disabled him from taking action to make his future\r\nsecure, must have concerned him to the exclusion of all else.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Rome was quiet, held so in the iron grip of Michele\r\nda Corella and the ducal troops. The Pope’s death was being kept secret\r\nfor the moment, and was not announced to the people until nightfall, by\r\nwhen Corella had carried out his master’s orders, including the seizure\r\nof the Pope’s treasure. And Burchard tells us how some of Valentinois’s\r\nmen entered the Vatican--all the gates of which were held by the ducal\r\ntroops--and, seizing Cardinal Casanova, they demanded, with a dagger\r\nat his throat and a threat to fling his corpse from the windows if\r\nhe refused them, the Pope’s keys. These the cardinal surrendered, and\r\nCorella possessed himself of plate and jewels to the value of some\r\n200,000 ducats, besides two caskets containing about 100,000 ducats in\r\ngold. Thereafter the servants of the palace completed the pillage by\r\nransacking the wardrobes and taking all they could find, so that nothing\r\nwas left in the papal apartments but the chairs, a few cushions, and the\r\ntapestries of the walls.\r\n\r\nAll his life Alexander had been the victim of the most ribald calumnies.\r\nStories had ever sprung up and thriven, like ill weeds, about his name\r\nand reputation. His sins, great and scandalous in themselves, were\r\nswelled by popular rumour, under the spur of malice, to monstrous and\r\nincredible proportions. As they had exaggerated and lied about the\r\nmanner of his life, so--with a consistency worthy of better scope--they\r\nexaggerated and lied about the manner of his death, and, the age being\r\na credulous one, the stories were such that writers of more modern\r\nand less credulous times dare not insist upon them, lest they should\r\ndiscredit--as they do--what else has been alleged against him.\r\n\r\nThus when, in his last delirium, the Pope uttered some such words as: “I\r\nam coming; I am coming. It is just. But wait a little,” and when those\r\nwords were repeated, it was straightway asserted that the Devil was the\r\nbeing he thus addressed in that supreme hour. The story grew in detail;\r\nthat is inevitable with such matter. He had bargained with the devil,\r\nit was said, for a pontificate of twelve years, and, the time being\r\ncompleted, the devil was come for him. And presently, we even have a\r\ndescription of Messer the Devil as he appeared on that occasion--in the\r\nshape of a baboon. The Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, in all seriousness,\r\nwrites to relate this. The chronicler Sanuto, receiving the now\r\npopularly current story from another source, in all seriousness gives it\r\nplace in his Diarii, thus:\r\n\r\n“The devil was seen to leap out of the room in the shape of a baboon.\r\nAnd a cardinal ran to seize him, and, having caught him, would have\r\npresented him to the Pope; but the Pope said, ‘Let him go, let him go.\r\nIt is the devil,’ and that night he fell ill and died.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Il diavolo sarebbe saltato fuori della camera in forma di babuino, et\r\nun cardinale corso per piarlo, e preso volendolo presentar al papa,\r\nil papa disse lasolo, lasolo ché ii diavolo. E poi la notte si amaló e\r\nmorite.”--Marino Sanuto, Diarii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat story, transcending the things which this more practical age\r\nconsiders possible, is universally rejected; but it is of vast\r\nimportance to the historical student; for it is to be borne in mind that\r\nit finds a place in the pages of those same Diarii upon the authority\r\nof which are accepted many defamatory stories without regard to their\r\nextreme improbability so long as they are within the bounds of bare\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nAfter Alexander was dead it was said that water boiled in his mouth, and\r\nthat steam issued from it as he lay in St. Peter’s, and much else of the\r\nsame sort, which the known laws of physiology compel so many of us very\r\nreluctantly to account exaggerations. But, again, remember that the\r\nsource of these stories was the same as the source of many other\r\nexaggerations not at issue with physiological laws.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of Alexander’s funeral are in the highest degree\r\nscandalous, and reflect the greatest discredit upon his age.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, as the clergy were chanting the Libera me, Domine in St.\r\nPeter’s, where the body was exposed on a catafalque in full pontificals,\r\na riot occurred, set on foot by the soldiers present for reasons which\r\nBurchard--who records the event--does not make clear.\r\n\r\nThe clerics fled for shelter to the sacristy, the chants were cut short,\r\nand the Pope’s body almost entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nBut the most scandalous happening occurred twenty-four hours later. The\r\nPope’s remains were removed to the Chapel of Santa Maria delle Febbre\r\nby six bearers who laughed and jested at the expense of the poor corpse,\r\nwhich was in case to provoke the coarse mirth of the lower classes of an\r\nage which, setting no value upon human life, knew no respect for death.\r\nBy virtue of the malady that had killed him, of his plethoric habit\r\nof body, and of the sweltering August heat, the corpse was decomposing\r\nrapidly, so that the face had become almost black and assumed an aspect\r\ngrotesquely horrible, fully described by Burchard:\r\n\r\n“Factus est sicut pannus vel morus nigerrimus, livoris totus plenus,\r\nnasus plenus, os amplissimum, lingua duplex in ore, que labia tota\r\nimplebat, os apertum et adeo horribile quod nemo viderit unquam vel esse\r\ntale dixerit.”\r\n\r\nTwo carpenters waited in the chapel with the coffin which they had\r\nbrought; but, either through carelessness it had been made too narrow\r\nand too short, or else the body, owing to its swollen condition, did\r\nnot readily fit into this receptable; whereupon, removing the mitre, for\r\nwhich there was no room, they replaced it by a piece of old carpet, and\r\nset themselves to force and pound the corpse into the coffin. And this\r\nwas done “without candle or any light being burned in honour of the\r\ndead, and without the presence of any priest or other person to care\r\nfor the Pope’s remains.” No explanation of this is forthcoming; it was\r\nprobably due to the panic earlier occasioned the clergy by the ducal\r\nmen-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe story that he had been poisoned was already spreading like a\r\nconflagration through Rome, arising out of the appearance of the body,\r\nwhich was such as was popularly associated with venenation.\r\n\r\nBut a Borgia in the rôle of a victim was altogether too unusual to be\r\nacceptable, and too much opposed to the taste to which the public had\r\nbeen educated; so the story must be edited and modified until suitable\r\nfor popular consumption. The supper-party at Cardinal Corneto’s villa\r\nwas remembered, and upon that a tale was founded, and trimmed by degrees\r\ninto plausible shape.\r\n\r\nAlexander had intended to poison Corneto--so ran this tale--that he\r\nmight possess himself of the cardinal’s vast riches; in the main a\r\nwell-worn story by now. To this end Cesare had bribed a butler to pour\r\nwine for the cardinal from a flask which he entrusted to him. Exit\r\nCesare. Exit presently the butler, carelessly leaving the poisoned wine\r\nupon a buffet. (The drama, you will observe, is perfectly mechanical,\r\nfull of author’s interventions, and elementary in its “preparations”).\r\nEnter the Pope. He thirsts, and calls for wine. A servant hastens; takes\r\nup, of course, the poisoned flask in ignorance of its true quality, and\r\npours for his Beatitude. Whilst the Pope drinks re-enters Cesare, also\r\nathirst, and, seating himself, he joins the Pope in the poisoned wine,\r\nall unsuspicious and having taken no precautions to mark the\r\nflask. Poetic justice is done, and down comes the curtain upon that\r\npreposterous tragi-farce.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story which Guicciardini and Giovio and a host of other more\r\nor less eminent historians have had the audacity to lay before their\r\nreaders as being the true circumstances of the death of Alexander VI.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy matter that in all that concerns the history of the\r\nHouse of Borgia, and more particularly those incidents in it that are\r\nwrapped in mystery, circumstantial elucidation has a habit of proceeding\r\nfrom the same quarters.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, for instance, that the Venetian Paolo Capello (though\r\nnot in Rome at the time) was one of those who was best informed in the\r\nmatter of the murder of the Duke of Gandia. And it was Capello again who\r\nwas possessed of the complete details of the scarcely less mysterious\r\nbusiness of Alfonso of Aragon. Another who on the subject of the murder\r\nof Gandia “had no doubts”--as he himself expressed it--was Pietro\r\nMartire d’Anghiera, in Spain at the time, whence he wrote to inform\r\nItaly of the true circumstances of a case that had happened in Italy.\r\n\r\nIt is again Pietro Martire d’Anghiera who, on November 10, 1503, writes\r\nfrom Burgos in Spain to inform Rome of the true facts of Alexander’s\r\ndeath--for it is in that letter of his that the tale of the flask of\r\nwine, as here set down, finds place for the first time.\r\n\r\nIt is unprofitable to pursue the matter further, since at this time\r\nof day even the most reluctant to reject anything that tells against\r\na Borgia have been compelled to admit that the burden of evidence is\r\naltogether too overwhelming in this instance, and that it is proved to\r\nthe hilt that Alexander died of the tertian fever then ravaging Rome.\r\n\r\nAnd just as the Pope’s death was the subject of the wildest fictions\r\nwhich have survived until very recent days, so too, was Cesare’s\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was the same Pietro Martire d’Anghiera who from Burgos wrote\r\nto inform Rome of what was taking place in the privacy of the Duke of\r\nValentinois’s apartments in the Vatican. Under his facile and magic pen,\r\nthe jar of ice-cold water into which Cesare was believed to have been\r\nplunged was transmuted into a mule which was ripped open that the\r\nfever-stricken Cesare might be packed into the pulsating entrails, there\r\nto sweat the fever out of him.\r\n\r\nBut so poor and sexless a beast as this seeming in the popular mind\r\ninadequate to a man of Cesare’s mettle, it presently improved upon and\r\nconverted it into a bull--so much more appropriate, too, as being the\r\nemblem of his house.\r\n\r\nNor does it seem that even then the story has gone far enough. Facilis\r\ninventis addere. There comes a French writer with an essay on the\r\nBorgias, than which--submitted as sober fact--nothing more amazingly\r\nlurid has been written. In this, with a suggestive cleverness entirely\r\nGallic, he causes us to gather an impression of Cesare in the intestinal\r\nsudatorium of that eventrated bull, as of one who is at once the\r\nhierophant and devotee of a monstrous, foul, and unclean rite of some\r\nunspeakable religion--a rite by comparison with which the Black Mass of\r\nthe Abbé Gribourg becomes a sweet and wholesome thing.\r\n\r\nBut hear the man himself:\r\n\r\n“Cet homme de meurtres et d’inceste, incarné dans l’animal des\r\nhécatombes et des bestialités antiques en évoque les monstrueuses\r\nimages. Je crois entendre le taureau de Phalaris et le taureau de\r\nPasiphaë répondre, de loin, par d’effrayants mugissements, aux cris\r\nhumains de ce bucentaure.”\r\n\r\nThat is the top note on this subject. Hereafter all must pale to\r\nanti-climax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. PIUS III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fever that racked Cesare Borgia’s body in those days can have been\r\nas nothing to the fever that racked his mind, the despairing rage that\r\nmust have whelmed his soul to see the unexpected--the one contingency\r\nagainst which he had not provided--cutting the very ground from\r\nunderneath his feet.\r\n\r\nAs he afterwards expressed himself to Macchiavelli, and as Macchiavelli\r\nhas left on record, Cesare had thought of everything, had provided for\r\neverything that might happen on his father’s death, save that in such a\r\nseason--when more than ever he should have need for all his strength of\r\nbody and of mind--he should, himself, be lying at the point of death.\r\n\r\nScarce was Alexander’s body cold than the duke’s enemies began to lift\r\ntheir heads. Already by the 20th of that month--two days after the Pope\r\nhad breathed his last--the Orsini were in arms and had led a rising, in\r\nretort to which Michele da Corella fired their palace on Montegiordano.\r\n\r\nVenice and Florence bethought them that the protection of France had\r\nbeen expressly for the Church and not for Cesare personally. So the\r\nVenetians at once supplied Guidobaldo da Montefeltre with troops\r\nwherewith to reconquer his dominions, and by the 24th he was master of\r\nS. Leo. In the city of Urbino itself Ramires, the governor, held out as\r\nlong as possible, then beat a retreat to Cesena, whilst Valentinois’s\r\npartisans in Urbino were mercilessly slaughtered and their houses\r\npillaged.\r\n\r\nFlorence supported the Baglioni in the conquest of Magione from the\r\nBorgias, and they aided Giacopo d’Appiano to repossess himself of\r\nPiombino, which had so gladly seen him depart out of it eighteen months\r\nago.\r\n\r\nFrom Magione, Gianpaolo Baglioni marches his Florentine troops to\r\nCamerino to aid the only remaining Varano to regain the tyranny of his\r\nfathers. The Vitelli are back in Città di Castello, carrying a golden\r\ncalf in triumph through the streets; and so by the end of August, within\r\nless than a fortnight, all the appendages of the Romagna are lost\r\nto Cesare, whilst at Cesare’s very gates the Orsini men-at-arms are\r\nclamouring with insistent menace.\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s best friend, in that crisis, was his secretary Agabito\r\nGherardi. For it is eminently probable--as Alvisi opines--that it was\r\nGherardi who urged his master to make an alliance with the Colonna,\r\nGherardi himself being related to that powerful family. The alliance of\r\nthese old enemies--Colonna and Borgia--was in their common interests,\r\nthat they might stand against their common enemy, Orsini--the old\r\nfriends of the Borgias.\r\n\r\nOn August 22 Prospero Colonna came to Rome, and terms were made and\r\ncemented, in the usual manner, by a betrothal--that of the little\r\nRodrigo--(Lucrezia’s child)--to a daughter of the House of Colonna.\r\nOn the same day the Sacred College confirmed Cesare in his office of\r\nCaptain-General and Gonfalonier of the Church, pending the election of a\r\nnew Pope.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, sick almost to the point of death, and scarce able to stir\r\nhand or foot, so weak in body had he been left by the heroic treatment\r\nto which he had submitted, Cesare continued mentally a miracle of energy\r\nand self-possession. He issued orders for the fortifying of the Vatican,\r\nand summoned from Romagna 200 horse and 1,000 foot to his aid in Rome,\r\nbidding Remolino, who brought these troops, to quarter himself at\r\nOrvieto, and there await his further orders.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the Colonna were fighting in Naples under the banner\r\nof Gonzalo de Cordoba, it was naturally enough supposed, from Cesare’s\r\nalliance with the former, that this time he was resolved to go over to\r\nthe side of Spain. Of this, M. de Trans came to protest to Valentinois\r\non behalf of Louis XII, to be answered by the duke’s assurances that the\r\nalliance into which he had entered was strictly confined to the Colonna,\r\nthat it entailed no treaty with Spain; nor had he entered into any; that\r\nhis loyalty to the King of France continued unimpaired, and that he\r\nwas ready to support King Louis with the entire forces he disposed\r\nof, whenever his Majesty should desire him so to do. In reply, he\r\nwas assured by the French ambassador and Cardinal Sanseverino of the\r\ncontinued protection of Louis, and that France would aid him to maintain\r\nhis dominions in Italy and reconquer any that might have seceded; and\r\nof this declaration copies were sent to Florence, Venice, and Bologna on\r\nSeptember 1, as a warning to those Powers not to engage in anything to\r\nthe hurt of Valentinois.\r\n\r\nThus sped the time of the novendiali--the nine days’ obsequies of the\r\ndead Pope--which were commenced on September 4.\r\n\r\nAs during the conclave that was immediately to follow it was against\r\nthe law for armed men to be in Rome, Cesare was desired by the Sacred\r\nCollege to withdraw his troops. He did so on September 2, and himself\r\nwent with them.\r\n\r\nCardinal Sanseverino and the French ambassador escorted him out of Rome\r\nand saw him take the road to Nepi--a weak, fever-ravaged, emaciated man,\r\nborne in a litter by a dozen of his halberdiers, his youth, his beauty,\r\nhis matchless strength of body all sapped from him by the insidious\r\ndisease which had but grudgingly spared his very life.\r\n\r\nAt Nepi he was awaited by his brother Giuffredo, who had preceded him\r\nthither from Rome. A shadowy personage this Giuffredo, whose unimportant\r\npersonality is tantalizingly elusive in the pages where mention is made\r\nof him. His incontinent wife, Doña Sancia, had gone to Naples under the\r\nescort of Prospero Colonna, having left the Castle of Sant’ Angelo where\r\nfor some time she had been confined by order of her father-in-law, the\r\nPope, on account of the disorders of her frivolous life.\r\n\r\nAnd now the advices of the fresh treaty between Cesare Borgia and the\r\nKing of France were producing their effect upon Venice and Florence, who\r\nwere given additional pause by the fierce jealousy of each other, which\r\nwas second only to their jealousy of the duke.\r\n\r\nFrom Venice--with or without the sanction of his Government--Bartolomeo\r\nd’Alviano had ridden south into the Romagna with his condotta\r\nimmediately upon receiving news of the death of Alexander, and, finding\r\nPandolfaccio Malatesta at Ravenna, he proceeded to accompany him back\r\nto that Rimini which the tyrant had sold to Cesare. Rimini, however,\r\nrefused to receive him back, and showed fight to the forces under\r\nd’Alviano. So that, for the moment, nothing was accomplished. Whereupon\r\nthe Republic, which at first had raised a feeble, make-believe protest\r\nat the action of her condottiero, now deemed it as well to find a\r\npretext for supporting him. So Venice alleged that a courier of hers had\r\nbeen stripped of a letter, and, with such an overwhelming cause as that\r\nfor hostilities, dispatched reinforcements to d’Alviano to the end that\r\nhe might restore Pandolfaccio to a dominion in which he was abhorred.\r\nFurther, d’Alviano was thereafter to proceed to do the like office for\r\nGiovanni Sforza, who already had taken ship for Pesaro, and who was\r\nrestored to his lordship on September 3.\r\n\r\nThence, carrying the war into the Romagna itself, d’Alviano marched upon\r\nCesena. But the Romagna was staunch and loyal to her duke. The governor\r\nhad shut himself up in Cesena with what troops he could muster,\r\nincluding a thousand veterans under the valiant Dionigio di Naldo,\r\nand there, standing firm and resolute, he awaited the onslaught of the\r\nVenetians.\r\n\r\nD’Alviano advanced rapidly and cruelly, a devastator laying waste the\r\ncountry in his passage, until to check him came suddenly the Borgia\r\ntroops, which had ventured upon a sally. The Venetians were routed and\r\nput to flight.\r\n\r\nOn September 16 the restored tyrants of Rimini, Pesaro, Castello,\r\nPerugia, Camerino, Urbino, and Sinigaglia entered into and signed at\r\nPerugia a league, whose chiefs were Bartolomeo d’Alviano and Gianpaolo\r\nBaglioni, for their common protection.\r\n\r\nFlorence was invited to join the allies. Intimidated, however, by\r\nFrance, not only did the Signory refuse to be included, but--in her\r\nusual manner--actually went so far as to advise Cesare Borgia of that\r\nrefusal and to offer him her services and help.\r\n\r\nOn the same date the Sacred College assembled in Rome, at the Mass of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, to beseech the grace of inspiration in the election of\r\nthe new Pontiff. The part usually played by the divine afflatus in\r\nthese matters was so fully understood and appreciated that the Venetian\r\nambassador received instructions from the Republic(1) to order the\r\nVenetian cardinals to vote for Giuliano della Rovere, whilst the King of\r\nFrance sent a letter--in his own hand--to the Sacred College desiring it\r\nto elect his friend the Cardinal d’Amboise, and Spain, at the same time,\r\nsought to influence the election of Carvajal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  See Sanuto’s Diarrii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chances of the last-named do not appear ever to have amounted\r\nto very much. The three best supported candidates were della Rovere,\r\nd’Amboise, and Ascanio Sforza--who made his reappearance in Rome,\r\nreleased from his French prison at last, in time to attend this\r\nConclave.\r\n\r\nNone of these three factions was strong enough to ensure the election\r\nof its own candidate, but any two were strong enough to prevent the\r\nelection of the candidate of the third. Wherefore it happened that, as\r\na result of so much jealousy and competition, recourse was had to\r\ntemporizing by electing the oldest and feeblest cardinal in the College.\r\nThus there should presently be another election, and meantime the\r\ncandidates would improve the time by making their arrangements and\r\ncanvassing their supporters so as to control the votes of the College at\r\nthat future Conclave. Therefore Francesco Piccolomini, Cardinal of\r\nSiena (nephew of Pius II), a feeble octogenarian, tormented by an ulcer,\r\nwhich, in conjunction with an incompetent physician, was to cut his life\r\neven shorter than they hoped, was placed upon the throne of St. Peter,\r\nand assumed with the Pontificate the name of Pius III.\r\n\r\nThe new Pope was entirely favourable to Cesare Borgia, and confirmed him\r\nin all his offices, signifying his displeasure to Venice at her attempt\r\nupon the Romagna, and issuing briefs to the allied tyrants commanding\r\nthem to desist from their opposition to the will of the Holy See.\r\n\r\nCesare returned to Rome, still weak on his legs and ghastly to behold,\r\nand on October 6 he received in St. Peter’s his confirmation as\r\nCaptain-General and Gonfalonier of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians had meanwhile been checked by a letter from Louis from\r\nlending further assistance to the allies. The latter, however, continued\r\ntheir hostilities in spite of that. They had captured Sinigaglia, and\r\nnow they made an attempt on Fano and Fermo, but were repulsed in both\r\nplaces by Cesare’s loyal subjects. At the same time the Ordelaffi--who\r\nin the old days had been deposed from the Tyranny of Forli to make room\r\nfor the Riarii--deemed the opportunity a good one to attempt to regain\r\ntheir lordship; but their attempt, too, was frustrated.\r\n\r\nCesare sat impotent in Rome, no doubt vexed by his own inaction. He\r\ncannot have lacked the will to go to the Romagna to support the subjects\r\nwho showed him such loyalty; but he lacked the means. Owing to the\r\nFrench and Spanish dispute in Naples, his army had practically melted\r\naway. The terms of his treaty with Louis compelled him to send the\r\nbulk of it to the camp at Garigliano to support the French, who were in\r\ntrouble. The force that Remolino had quartered at Orvieto to await the\r\nduke’s orders he had been unable to retain there. Growing uneasy at\r\ntheir position, and finding it impossible either to advance or to\r\nretreat, being threatened on the one side by the Baglioni and on the\r\nother by the Orsini, these troops had steadily deserted; whilst most\r\nof Cesare’s Spanish captains and their followers had gone to the aid of\r\ntheir compatriots under Gonzalo de Cordoba in response to that captain’s\r\nsummons of every Spaniard in the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThus did it come about that Cesare had no force to afford his Romagna\r\nsubjects. His commissioners in the north did what was possible to repair\r\nthe damage effected by the allies, and they sent Dionigio di Naldo with\r\nsix hundred of his foot, and, further, a condotta of two hundred horse,\r\nagainst Rimini. This was captured by them in one day and almost without\r\nresistance, Pandolfaccio flying for his life to Pesaro.\r\n\r\nNext the allies, by attempting to avenge the rout they had suffered\r\nat Cesena, afforded the ducal troops an opportunity of scoring another\r\nvictory. They prepared a second attack against Cesare’s capital, and\r\nwith an army of considerable strength they advanced to the very walls of\r\nthe stronghold, laying the aqueduct in ruins and dismantling what other\r\nbuildings they found in their way. But in Cesena the gallant Pedro\r\nRamires lay in wait for them. Issuing to meet them, he not only put them\r\nto flight and drove them for shelter into the fortress of Montebello,\r\nbut laid siege to them there and broke them utterly, with a loss, as was\r\nreputed, of some three hundred men in slain alone.\r\n\r\nThe news of this came to cheer Valentinois, who, moreover, had now\r\nthe Pope and France to depend upon. Further, and in view of that\r\nsame protection, the Orsini were already treating with him for a\r\nreconciliation, despite the fact that the Orsini blood was scarce dry\r\nupon his hands. But he had a resolute, sly, and desperate enemy in\r\nVenice, and on October 10 there arrived in Rome Bartolomeo d’Alviano and\r\nGianpaolo Baglioni, who repaired to the Venetian ambassador and informed\r\nhim that they were come in quest of the person of Valentinois, intending\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nTo achieve their ends they united themselves to the Orsini, who were\r\nnow in arms in Rome, their attempted reconciliation with Cesare having\r\naborted. Valentinois’s peril became imminent, and from the Vatican he\r\nwithdrew for shelter to the Castle of Sant’ Angelo, going by way of the\r\nunderground passage built by his father.\r\n\r\nThence he summoned Michele da Corella, who was at Rocca Soriana with his\r\nfoot, and Taddeo della Volpe (a valiant captain and a great fighter, who\r\nhad already lost an eye in Cesare’s service) and Baldassare Scipione,\r\nwho were in the Neapolitan territory with their men-at-arms. He was\r\ngathering his sinews for a spring, when suddenly the entire face of\r\naffairs was altered and all plans were checked by the death of Pius III\r\non October 18, after a reign of twenty-six days.\r\n\r\nOnce more there was an end to Cesare’s credit. No man might say what the\r\nfuture held in store. Giustiniani, indeed, wrote to his Government\r\nthat Cesare was about to withdraw to France, and that he had besought\r\na safe-conduct of the Orsini--which report is as true as many another\r\ncommunication from the same Venetian pen, ever ready to write what\r\nit hoped might be true; and it is flatly contradicted by the\r\nbetter-informed Macchiavelli, who was writing at the same time:\r\n\r\n“The duke is in Sant’ Angelo, and is more hopeful than ever of\r\naccomplishing great things, presupposing a Pope according to the wishes\r\nof his friends.”\r\n\r\nBut the Romagna was stirred once more to the turbulence from which it\r\nhad scarcely settled. Forli and Rimini were lost almost at once, the\r\nOrdelaffi succeeding in capturing the former in this their second\r\nattempt, whilst Pandolfaccio once more sat in his palace at Rimini,\r\nhaving cut his way to it through a sturdy resistance. Against Imola\r\nBentivogli dispatched a force of two thousand foot; but this was beaten\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe authority of France appeared to have lost its weight, and in vain\r\ndid Cardinal d’Amboise thunder threats in the name of his friend King\r\nLouis, and send envoys to Florence, Venice, Bologna, and Urbino,\r\nto complain of the injuries that were being done to the Duke of\r\nValentinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. JULIUS II\r\n\r\n\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vincoli, had much in his\r\ncharacter that was reminiscent of his terrible uncle, Sixtus IV.\r\nLike that uncle of his, he had many failings highly unbecoming any\r\nChristian--laic or ecclesiastic--which no one has attempted to screen;\r\nand, incidentally, he cultivated morality in his private life and\r\nobserved his priestly vows of chastity as little as did any other\r\nchurchman of his day. For you may see him, through the eyes of Paride de\r\nGrassi,(1) unable one Good Friday to remove his shoes for the adoration\r\nof the cross in consequence of his foot’s affliction--ex morbo gallico.\r\nBut with one great and splendid virtue was he endowed in the eyes of the\r\nenemies of the House of Borgia--contemporary, and subsequent down to\r\nour times--a most profound, unchristian, and mordacious hatred of all\r\nBorgias.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 Burchard’s successor in the office of Master of Ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoderigo Borgia had defeated him in the Conclave of 1492, and for twelve\r\nyears had kept him out of the coveted pontificate. You have seen how he\r\nfound expression for his furious jealousy at his rival’s success. You\r\nhave seen him endeavouring to his utmost to accomplish the deposition of\r\nthe Borgia Pope, wielding to that end the lever of simony and seeking a\r\nfulcrum for it, first in the King of France and later in Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella; but failing hopelessly in both instances. You have seen him,\r\nwhen he realized the failure of an attempt which had made Rome too\r\ndangerous for him and compelled him to remain in exile, suddenly veering\r\nround to fawn and flatter and win the friendship of one whom his enmity\r\ncould not touch.\r\n\r\nThis man who, as Julius II, was presently to succeed Pius III, has\r\nbeen accounted a shining light of virtue amid the dark turpitude of the\r\nChurch in the Renaissance. An ignis fatuus, perhaps; a Jack-o’-lanthorn\r\nbegotten of putrescence. Surely no more than that.\r\n\r\nDr. Jacob Burckhardt, in that able work of his to which reference\r\nalready has been made, follows the well-worn path of unrestrained\r\ninvective against the Borgias, giving to the usual empty assertions\r\nthe place which should be assigned to evidence and argument. Like his\r\npredecessors along that path, he causes Giuliano della Rovere to\r\nshine heroically by contrast--a foil to throw into greater relief the\r\nblackness of Alexander. But he carries assertion rather further than do\r\nothers when he says of Cardinal della Rovere that “He ascended the steps\r\nof St. Peter’s Chair without simony and amid general applause, and\r\nwith him ceased, at all events, the undisguised traffic in the highest\r\noffices of the Church.”\r\n\r\nOther writers in plenty have suggested this, but none has quite so\r\nplainly and resoundingly thrown down the gauntlet, which we will make\r\nbold to lift.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Burckhardt wrote in other than good faith is not to be\r\nimputed. It must therefore follow that an entry in the Diarium of the\r\nCaerimoniarius under date of October 29, 1503, escaped him utterly in\r\nthe course of his researches. For the Diarium informs us that on that\r\nday, in the Apostolic Palace, Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of S.\r\nPietro in Vincoli, concluded the terms of an agreement with the Duke of\r\nValentinois and the latter’s following of Spanish cardinals, by which\r\nhe undertook that, in consideration of his receiving the votes of these\r\nSpanish cardinals and being elected Pope, he would confirm Cesare in his\r\noffice of Gonfalonier and Captain-General, and would preserve him in the\r\ndominion of the Romagna. And, in consideration of that undertaking, the\r\nSpanish cardinals, on their side, promised to give him their suffrages.\r\n\r\nHere are the precise words in which Burchard records the transaction:\r\n\r\n“Eadem die, 29 Octobris, Rmus. D. S. Petri ad Vincula venit in\r\npalatio apostolico cum duce Valentino et cardinalibus suis Hispanis et\r\nconcluserunt capitula eorum per que, inter alia, cardinalis S. Petri ad\r\nVincula, postquam esset papa, crearet confalonierium Ecclesiae generalem\r\nducem ac ei faveret et in statibus suis (relinqueret) et vice versa dux\r\npape; et promiserunt omnes cardinalis Hispani dare votum pro Cardinali\r\nS. Petri ad Vincula ad papatum.”\r\n\r\nIf that does not entail simony and sacrilege, then such things do\r\nnot exist at all. More, you shall hunt in vain for any accusation so\r\nauthoritative, formal and complete, regarding the simony practised by\r\nAlexander VI on his election. And this same Julius, moreover, was the\r\nPope who later was to launch his famous Bull de Simoniaca Electione, to\r\nadd another stain to the besmirched escutcheon of the Borgia Pontiff.\r\n\r\nHis conciliation of Cesare and his obtaining, thus, the support of the\r\nSpanish cardinals, who, being Alexander’s creatures, were now Cesare’s\r\nvery faithful servants, ensured the election of della Rovere; for,\r\nwhilst those cardinals’ votes did not suffice to place him in St.\r\nPeter’s Chair, they would abundantly have sufficed to have kept him out\r\nof it had Cesare so desired them.\r\n\r\nIn coming to terms with Cardinal della Rovere, Cesare made the first\r\ngreat mistake of his career, took the first step towards ruin. He\r\nshould have known better than to have trusted such a man. He should have\r\nremembered the ancient bitter rancour; should have recognized, in the\r\namity of later times, the amity of the self-seeker, and mistrusted it.\r\nBut della Rovere had acquired a reputation for honesty and for being\r\na man of his word. How far he deserved it you may judge from what is\r\npresently to follow. He had acquired it, however, and Cesare, to his\r\nundoing, attached faith to that reputation. He may, to some extent, have\r\ncounted upon the fact that, of Cardinal della Rovere’s bastard children,\r\nonly a daughter--Felice della Rovere--survived. Raffaele, the last of\r\nhis bastard boys, had died a year ago. Thus, Cesare may have concluded\r\nthat the cardinal having no sons whose fortunes he must advance, would\r\nlack temptation to break faith with him.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it resulted that, at the Conclave of November 1, Giuliano\r\ndella Rovere was elected Pope, and took the name of Julius II; whilst\r\nValentinois, confident now that his future was assured, left the\r\nCastle of Sant’ Angelo to take up his residence at the Vatican, in the\r\nBelvedere, with forty gentlemen constituting his suite.\r\n\r\nOn November 3 Julius II issued briefs to the Romagna, ordering obedience\r\nto Cesare, with whom he was now in daily and friendliest intercourse.\r\n\r\nIn the Romagna, meanwhile, the disturbances had not only continued, but\r\nthey had taken a fresh turn. Venice, having reseated Malatesta on the\r\nthrone, now vented at last the covetousness she had ever, herself,\r\nmanifested of that dominion, and sent a force to drive him out again and\r\nconquer Rimini for the Republic.\r\n\r\nFlorence, in a spasm of jealous anger at this, inquired was the Pope to\r\nbecome the chaplain of Venice, and dispatched Macchiavelli to bear the\r\ntale of these doings to Julius.\r\n\r\nUnder so much perpetual strife the strength of the Romagna was gradually\r\ncrumbling, and Cesare, angry with Florence for never going beyond\r\nlip-service, expressed that anger to Macchiavelli, informing the\r\nambassador that the Signory could have saved the Romagna for him with a\r\nhundred men-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe duke sent for Giustiniani, the ambassador of Venice, who, however,\r\nexcused himself and did not go. This within a week of the new Pope’s\r\nelection, showing already how men discerned what was in store for\r\nValentinois. Giustiniani wrote to his Government that he had not gone\r\nlest his going should give the duke importance in the eyes of others.(1)\r\nThe pettiness and meanness of the man, revealed in that dispatch, will\r\nenable you to attach to Giustiniani the label that belongs to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  “Per non dar materia ad altri che fazino un po di lui mazor estimazion\r\ndi quel che fanno quando lo vedessero in parte alcuna\r\nfavorito.”--Giustiniani, Dispatch of November 6, 1503.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo cheer Valentinois in those days of depression came news that his\r\nsubjects of Imola had successfully resisted an attack on the part of the\r\nVenetians. So stimulated was he that he prepared at once to go, himself,\r\ninto the Romagna, and obtained from the Pope, from d’Amboise, and\r\nfrom Soderini, letters to Florence desiring the Signory to afford him\r\nsafe-conduct through Tuscany for himself and his army.\r\n\r\nThe Pope expressed himself, in his letter, that he would count such\r\nsafe-conduct as a great favour to himself, and urged the granting of it\r\nout of his “love for Cesare,” owing to the latter’s “great virtues and\r\nshining merits.”(2) Yet on the morrow of dispatching that brief, this\r\nman, who was accounted honest, straightforward, and imbued with a\r\nlove of truth, informed Giustiniani--or else Giustiniani lied in his\r\ndispatches--that he understood that the Venetians were assailing the\r\nRomagna, not out of enmity to the Church, but to punish the demerits of\r\nCesare, and he made it plain to Giustiniani that, if he complained\r\nof the conduct of the Venetians, it was on his own behalf and not on\r\nCesare’s, as his aim was to preserve the Romagna, not for the duke, but\r\nfor the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n  2  “In quo nobis rem gratissimam facietis ducis enim ipsum propter ejus\r\ninsignes virtutes et praeclara merita praecipuo affectur et caritate\r\npraecipua complectimur.”--Archivio di Stato, Firenze. (See Alvisi, Doct.\r\n96.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the aim we have no quarrel. It was laudable enough in a Pontiff.\r\nBut it foreshadows Cesare’s ruin, in spite of the love-protesting letter\r\nto Florence, in spite of the bargain struck by virtue of which Julius\r\nhad obtained the pontificate. Whether the Pope went further in his\r\ntreachery, whether, having dispatched that brief to Florence, he sent\r\nother communications to the Signory, is not ascertainable; but the\r\nsuspicion of some such secret action is inspired by what ensued.\r\n\r\nOn November 13 Cesare was ready to leave Rome; but no safe-conduct\r\nhad arrived. Out of all patience at this, he begged the Pope that the\r\ncaptain of the pontifical navy should prepare him five galleons at\r\nOstia, by which he could take his foot to Genoa, and thence proceed into\r\nRomagna by way of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli, at the same time, was frenziedly importuning Florence to\r\ngrant the duke the desired safe-conduct lest in despair Cesare should\r\nmake a treaty with Venice--“or with the devil”--and should go to Pisa,\r\nemploying all his money, strength, and influence to vent his wrath upon\r\nthe Signory. But the Signory knew more, perhaps, than did Macchiavelli,\r\nfor no attention was paid to his urgent advice.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th Cesare left Rome to set out for Genoa by way of Ostia, and\r\nhis departure threw Giustiniani into alarm--fearing that the duke would\r\nnow escape.\r\n\r\nBut there was no occasion for his fears. On the very day of Cesare’s\r\ndeparture Julius sent fresh briefs to the Romagna, different indeed\r\nfrom those of November 3. In these he now expressed his disapproval of\r\nAlexander’s having conferred the vicarship of the Romagna upon Cesare\r\nBorgia, and he exhorted all to range themselves under the banner of the\r\nChurch, under whose protection he intended to keep them.\r\n\r\nEvents followed quickly upon that. Two days later news reached the Pope\r\nthat the Venetians had captured Faenza, whereupon he sent a messenger\r\nafter Valentinois to suggest to the latter that he should surrender\r\nForli and the other fiefs into pontifical hands. With this Cesare\r\nrefused to comply, and, as a result, he was detained by the captain of\r\nthe navy, in obedience to the instructions from Julius. At the same time\r\nthe Pope broke the last link of the treaty with Cesare by appointing\r\na new Governor of Romagna in the person of Giovanni Sacchi, Bishop of\r\nRagusa. He commanded the latter to take possession of the Romagna in the\r\nname of the Church, and he issued another brief--the third within three\r\nweeks--demanding the State’s obedience to the new governor.\r\n\r\nOn November 26, Remolino, who had been at Ostia with Cesar; came to\r\nRome, and, throwing himself at the feet of the Pontiff, begged for mercy\r\nfor his lord, whom he now accounted lost. He promised Julius that Cesare\r\nshould give him the countersigns of the strongholds, together with\r\nsecurity for their surrender. This being all that the Pope could desire,\r\nhe issued orders that Cesare be brought back to Rome, and in Consistory\r\nadvised the Sacred College--by way, no doubt, of exculpating himself\r\nto men who knew that he was refusing to pay the price at which he had\r\nbought the Papacy--that the Venetians in the Romagna were not moving\r\nagainst the Church, but against Cesare himself--wherefore he had\r\ndemanded of Cesare the surrender of the towns he held, that thus there\r\nmight be an end to the war.\r\n\r\nIt was specious--which is the best that can be said for it.\r\n\r\nAs for putting an end to the war, the papal brief was far indeed from\r\nachieving any such thing, as was instantly plain from the reception it\r\nmet with in the Romagna, which persisted in its loyalty to Cesare in\r\ndespite of the very Pope himself. When that brief was read in Cesena a\r\nwild tumult ensued, and the people ran through the streets clamouring\r\nangrily for their duke.\r\n\r\nIt was very plain what short work would have been made of such men as\r\nthe Ordelaffi and the Malatesta had Cesare gone north. But Cesare was\r\nfast at the Vatican, treated by the Pope with all outward friendliness\r\nand consideration, but virtually a prisoner none the less. Julius\r\ncontinued to press for the surrender of the Romagna strongholds,\r\nwhich Remolino had promised in his master’s name; but Cesare persisted\r\nobstinately to refuse, until the news reached him that Michele da\r\nCorella and della Volpe, who had gone north with seven hundred horse to\r\nsupport his Romagnuoli, had been cut to pieces in Tuscany by the army of\r\nGianpaolo Baglioni.\r\n\r\nCesare bore his burning grievance to the Pope. The Pope sympathized with\r\nhim most deeply; then went to write a letter to the Florentines to\r\nthank them for what had befallen and to beg them to send him Michele\r\nda Corella under a strong escort--that redoubtable captain having been\r\ntaken prisoner together with della Volpe.\r\n\r\nCorella was known to be fully in the duke’s confidence, and there were\r\nrumours that he was accused of many things perpetrated on the duke’s\r\nbehalf. Julius, bent now on Cesare’s ruin, desired to possess himself\r\nof this man in the hope of being able to put him upon his trial under\r\ncharges which should reflect discredit upon Cesare.\r\n\r\nAt last the duke realized that he was betrayed, and that all was\r\nlost, and so he submitted to the inevitable, and gave the Pope the\r\ncountersigns he craved. With these Julius at once dispatched an envoy\r\ninto the Romagna, and, knowing the temper of Cesare’s captains, he\r\ninsisted that this envoy should be accompanied by Piero d’Orvieto, as\r\nCesare’s own commissioner, to demand that surrender.\r\n\r\nBut the intrepid Pedro Ramires, who held Cesena, knowing the true facts\r\nof the case, and conceiving how his duke had been constrained, instead\r\nof making ready to yield, proceeded further to fortify for resistance.\r\nWhen the commissioners appeared before his gates he ordered the\r\nadmission of Piero d’Orvieto. That done, he declared that he desired to\r\nsee his duke at liberty before he would surrender the citadel which he\r\nheld for him, and, taking d’Orvieto, he hanged him from the battlements\r\nas a traitor and a bad servant who did a thing which the duke, had he\r\nbeen at liberty, would never have had him do.\r\n\r\nMoncalieri, the papal envoy, returned to Rome with the news, and this\r\nso inflamed the Pope that the Cardinals Lodovico Borgia and Francesco\r\nRemolino, together with other Borgia partisans, instantly fled from\r\nRome, where they no longer accounted themselves safe, and sought refuge\r\nwith Gonzalo de Cordoba in the Spanish camp at Naples, imploring his\r\nprotection at the same time for Cesare.\r\n\r\nThe Pope’s anger first vented itself in the confiscation of the Duke of\r\nValentinois’s property wherever possible, to satisfy the claims of the\r\nRiarii (the Pope’s nephews) who demanded an indemnity of 50,000 ducats,\r\nof Guidobaldo, who demanded 200,000 ducats, and of the Florentine\r\nRepublic, which claimed the same. The duke’s ruin was by now--within six\r\nweeks of the election of Julius II--an accomplished fact; and many\r\nwere those who chose to fall with him rather than abandon him in his\r\nextremity. They afford a spectacle of honour and loyalty that was\r\nexceedingly rare in the Italy of the Renaissance; clinging to their\r\nduke, even when the last ray of hope was quenched, they lightened for\r\nhim the tedium of those last days at the Vatican during which he was no\r\nbetter than a prisoner of state.\r\n\r\nSuddenly came news of Gonzalo de Cordoba’s splendid victory at\r\nGarigliano--a victory which definitely broke the French and gave the\r\nthrone of Naples to Spain. Naturally this set Spanish influence once\r\nmore, and mightily, in the ascendant, and the Spanish cardinals,\r\ntogether with the ambassador of Spain, came to exert with the Pope an\r\ninfluence suddenly grown weighty.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, Cesare, escorted by Carvajal, Cardinal of Santa Croce,\r\nwas permitted to depart to Ostia, whence he was to take ship for France.\r\nLeastways, such was the understanding upon which he left the Vatican.\r\nBut the Pope was not minded, even now, to part with him so easily, and\r\nhis instructions to Carvajal were that at Ostia he should await further\r\norders before sailing.\r\n\r\nBut on December 26, news reaching the Spanish cardinal that the Romagna\r\nfortresses--persuaded that Cesare had been liberated--had finally\r\nsurrendered, Carvajal took it upon himself to allow Cesare to depart,\r\nupon receiving from him a written undertaking never to bear arms against\r\nPope Julius II.\r\n\r\nSo the Duke of Valentinois at last regained his freedom. Whether, in\r\nrepairing straight to Naples, as he did, he put a preconceived plan\r\ninto execution, or whether, even now, he mistrusted his enlargement, and\r\nthought thus to make himself secure, cannot be ascertained. But\r\nstraight to Gonzalo de Cordoba’s Spanish camp he went, equipped with\r\na safe-conduct from the Great Captain, obtained for Cesare by Cardinal\r\nRemolino.\r\n\r\nThere he found a court of friends already awaiting him, among whom were\r\nhis brother Giuffredo and the Cardinal Lodovico Borgia, and he received\r\nfrom Gonzalo a very cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nSpain was considering the invasion of Tuscany with the ultimate\r\nobject of assailing Milan and driving the French out of the peninsula\r\naltogether. Piero de’Medici--killed at Garigliano--had no doubt been\r\nserving Spain with some such end in view as the conquest of Florence,\r\nand, though Piero was dead, there was no reason why the plan should be\r\nabandoned; rather, all the more reason to carry it forward, since now\r\nSpain would more directly profit by it. Bartolomeo d’Alviano was to have\r\ncommanded the army destined for that campaign; but Cesare, by virtue\r\nof his friends and influence in Pisa, Siena, and Piombino, was so\r\npreferable a captain for such an expedition that Gonzalo gave him charge\r\nof it within a few days of his arrival at the Spanish camp.\r\n\r\nTo Cesare this would have been the thin end of a mighty edge. Here was\r\na chance to begin all over again, and, beginning thus, backed by Spanish\r\narms, there was no saying how far he might have gone. Meanwhile, what a\r\nbeginning! To avenge himself thus upon that Florentine Republic which,\r\nunder the protection of France, had dared at every turn to flout him and\r\nhad been the instrument of his ultimate ruin! Sweet to him would have\r\nbeen the poetic justice he would have administered--as sweet to him\r\nas it would have been terrible to Florence, upon which he would have\r\ndescended like another scourge of God.\r\n\r\nBriskly and with high-running hopes he set about his preparations during\r\nthat spring of 1504 what time the Pope’s Holiness in Rome was seeking to\r\njustify his treachery by heaping odium upon the Borgias. Thus he thought\r\nto show that if he had broken faith, he had broken faith with knaves\r\ndeserving none. It was in pursuit of this that Michele da Corella was\r\nnow pressed with questions, which, however, yielded nothing, and that\r\nAsquino de Colloredo (the sometime servant of Cardinal Michaeli)\r\nwas tortured into confessing that he had poisoned his master at the\r\ninstigation of Alexander and Cesare--as has been seen--which confession\r\nPope Julius was very quick to publish.\r\n\r\nBut in Naples, it may well be that Cesare cared nought for these\r\nmatters, busy and hopeful as he was just then. He dispatched Baldassare\r\nda Scipione to Rome to enlist what lances he could find, and Scipione\r\nput it about that his lord would soon be returning to his own and giving\r\nhis enemies something to think about.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, out of clearest heavens, fell a thunderbolt to\r\nshiver this last hope.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 26, as Cesare was leaving Gonzalo’s quarters, where\r\nhe had supped, an officer stepped forward to demand his sword. He was\r\nunder arrest.\r\n\r\nJulius II had out-manoeuvred him. He had written to Spain setting\r\nforth what was his agreement with Valentinois in the matter of the\r\nRomagna--the original agreement which was the price of the Pontificate,\r\nhad, of course, been conveniently effaced from the pontifical memory. He\r\naddressed passionate complaints to Ferdinand and Isabella that Gonzalo\r\nde Cordoba and Cardinal Carvajal between them were affording Valentinois\r\nthe means to break that agreement, and to undertake matters that were\r\nhostile to the Holy See. And Ferdinand and Isabella had put it upon\r\nGonzalo de Cordoba, that most honourable and gallant captain, to do\r\nthis thing in gross violation of his safe-conduct and plighted word to\r\nValentinois. It was a deed under the shame of which the Great Captain\r\nconfessedly laboured to the end of his days, as his memory has laboured\r\nunder it ever since. For great captains are not afforded the immunity\r\nenjoyed by priests and popes jointly with other wearers of the petticoat\r\nfrom the consequences of falsehood and violated trust.\r\n\r\nFierce and bitter were Valentinois’s reproaches of the Great Captain for\r\nthis treachery--as fierce and bitter as they were unavailing. On August\r\n20, 1504, Cesare Borgia took ship for Spain--a prisoner bound for a\r\nSpanish dungeon. Thus, at the early age of twenty-nine, he passed from\r\nItaly and the deeds that well might have filled a lifetime.\r\n\r\nConspicuous amid those he left behind him who remained loyal to their\r\nduke was Baldassare Scipione, who published throughout Christendom a\r\ncartel, wherein he challenged to trial by combat any Spaniard who dared\r\ndeny that the Duke of Valentinois had been detained a prisoner in Naples\r\nin spite of the safe-conduct granted him in the name of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, “with great shame and infamy to their crown.”(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Quoted by Alvisi, on the authority of a letter of Luigi da Porto,\r\nMarch 16, 1510, in Lettere Storiche.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis challenge was never taken up.\r\n\r\nAmongst other loyal ones was that fine soldier of fortune, Taddeo della\r\nVolpe, who, in his Florentine prison, refused all offers to enter the\r\nservice of the Signory until he had learnt that his lord was gone from\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nFracassa and Mirafuente had held Forli until they received guarantees\r\nfor Cesare’s safety (after he had left Ostia to repair to the Spanish\r\ncamp). They then rode out, with the honours of war, lance on thigh.\r\nDionigio di Naldo, that hardy captain of foot, entered the service of\r\nVenice; but to the end he wore the device of his dear lord, and imposed\r\nthe same upon all who served under his banner.\r\n\r\nDon Michele da Corella was liberated by Julius II after an interrogatory\r\nwhich can have revealed nothing defamatory to Cesare or his father; as\r\nit is unthinkable that a Pope who did all that man could do to ruin the\r\nHouse of Borgia and to befoul its memory, should have preserved silence\r\ntouching any such revelations as were hoped for when Corella was put to\r\ntorture. That most faithful of all Cesare’s officers--and sharer of the\r\nodium that has been heaped upon Cesare’s name--entered the service of\r\nthe Signory of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. ATROPOS\r\n\r\n\r\nVain were the exertions put forth by the Spanish cardinals to obtain\r\nCesare’s enlargement, and vainer still the efforts of his sister\r\nLucrezia, who wrote letter after letter to Francesco Gonzaga of\r\nMantua--now Gonfalonier of the Church, and a man of influence at the\r\nVatican--imploring him to use his interest with the Pope to the same\r\nend.\r\n\r\nJulius II remained unmoved, fearing the power of Cesare Borgia, and\r\nresolved that he should trouble Italy no more. On the score of that, no\r\nblame attaches to the Pope. The States which Borgia had conquered in\r\nthe name of the Church should remain adherent to the Church. Upon that\r\nJulius was resolved, and the resolve was highly laudable. He would\r\nhave no duke who controlled such a following as did Cesare, using those\r\nStates as stepping-stones to greater dominions in which, no doubt, he\r\nwould later have absorbed them, alienating them, so, from the Holy See.\r\n\r\nIn all this Julius II was most fully justified. The odious matter in his\r\nconduct, however, is the abominable treachery it entailed, following as\r\nit did upon the undertaking by virtue of which he gained the tiara.\r\n\r\nFor some months after his arrival in Spain, Cesare was confined in the\r\nprison of Chinchilla, whence--as a result, it is said, of an attempt\r\non his part to throw the governor bodily over the battlements--he was\r\nremoved to the fortress of Medina del Campo, and kept well guarded by\r\norders of the Pope.\r\n\r\nRumours that he had been liberated by the King of Spain overran the\r\nRomagna more than once, and set the country in a ferment, even reaching\r\nthe Vatican and shaking the stout-hearted Julius into alarm.\r\n\r\nOne chance of regaining his ancient might, and wreaking a sweet and\r\nterrific vengeance upon his betrayers came very close to him, but\r\npassed him by. This chance occurred in 1505, when--Queen Isabella being\r\ndead--King Ferdinand discovered that Gonzalo de Cordoba was playing him\r\nfalse in Naples. The Spanish king conceived a plan--according to the\r\nchronicles of Zurita--to employ Cesare as a flail for the punishment of\r\nthe Great Captain. He proposed to liberate the duke, set him at the\r\nhead of an army, and loose him upon Naples, trusting to the formidable\r\nalliance of Cesare’s military talents with his hatred of Gonzalo--who\r\nhad betrayed him--to work the will of his Catholic Majesty.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Cesare, there were difficulties. Ferdinand’s power was\r\nno longer absolute in Castille now that Isabella was dead. He sought to\r\novercome these difficulties; but the process was a slow one, and in\r\nthe course of it, spurred also by increased proofs of his lieutenant’s\r\nperfidy, Ferdinand lost patience, and determined--the case having grown\r\nurgent--to go to Naples in person to deal with Gonzalo.\r\n\r\nPlainly, Cesare’s good fortune, which once had been proverbial, had now\r\nutterly deserted him.\r\n\r\nHe had received news of what was afoot, and his hopes had run high once\r\nmore, only to suffer cruel frustration when he learnt that Ferdinand had\r\nsailed, himself, for Naples. In his despair the duke roused himself to a\r\nlast effort to win his freedom.\r\n\r\nHis treatment in prison was fairly liberal, such as is usually measured\r\nout to state prisoners of consideration. He was allowed his own chaplain\r\nand several attendants, and, whilst closely guarded and confined to the\r\nHomenaje Tower of the fortress, yet he was not oppressively restrained.\r\nHe was accorded certain privileges and liberties; he enjoyed the faculty\r\nof corresponding with the outer world, and even of receiving visits.\r\nAmongst his visitors was the Count of Benavente--a powerful lord of\r\nthe neighbourhood, who, coming under the spell of Cesare’s fascination,\r\nbecame so attached to him, and so resolved to do his will and effect his\r\nliberation, that--says Zurita--he was prepared even to go the length of\r\naccomplishing it by force of arms should no other way present itself.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  Sanuto confirms Zurita, in the main, by letters received by the\r\nVenetian Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother way, however, did present itself, and Benavente and the duke\r\nhatched a plot of evasion in which they had the collaboration of the\r\nchaplain and a servant of the governor’s, named Garcia.\r\n\r\nOne September night a cord was let down from the crenels of the tower,\r\nand by this the duke was to descend from his window to the castle ditch,\r\nwhere Benavente’s men awaited him. Garcia was to go with him since,\r\nnaturally, it would not be safe for the servants to remain behind, and\r\nGarcia now let himself down that rope, hand over hand, from the terrible\r\nheight of the duke’s window. It was only when he had reached the end of\r\nit that he discovered that the rope was not long enough, and that below\r\nhim there was still a chasm that might well have appalled even desperate\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nTo return was impossible. The duke above was growing impatient. Garcia\r\nloosed his hold, and dropped the remainder of the distance, breaking\r\nboth his legs in the fall. Groaning, he lay there in the ditch, whilst\r\nhand over hand now came the agile, athletic duke, unconscious of his\r\npredecessor’s fate, and of what awaited him at the end. He reached it,\r\nand was dangling there, perhaps undecided whether or not to take that\r\ndaring leap, when suddenly his doubts were resolved for him. His evasion\r\nwas already discovered. The castle was in alarm, and some one above him\r\ncut the rope and precipitated him into the ditch.\r\n\r\nBenavente’s men--we do not know how many of them were at hand--ran to\r\nhim instantly. They found him seriously injured, and that he, too, had\r\nbroken bones is beyond doubt. They lifted him up, and bore him with all\r\nspeed to the horses. They contrived, somehow, to mount him upon one,\r\nand, holding him in the saddle, they rode off as fast as was possible\r\nunder the circumstances. There was no time to go back for the\r\nunfortunate Garcia. The castle was all astir by now to stop the\r\nfugitives, and to have returned would have been to suffer capture\r\nthemselves as well as the duke, without availing the servant.\r\n\r\nSo poor Garcia was left to his fate. He was found by the governor where\r\nhe had fallen, and he was immediately put to death.\r\n\r\nIf the people of Medina organized a pursuit it availed them nothing, for\r\nCesare was carried safely to Benavente’s stronghold at Villalon.\r\n\r\nThere he lay for some five or six weeks to recover from the hurts he\r\nhad taken in escaping, and to allow his hands--the bones of which were\r\nbroken--to become whole again. At last, being in the main recovered,\r\nthough with hands still bandaged, he set out with two attendants and\r\nmade for Santander. Thence they took ship to Castro Urdiales, Cesare\r\naiming now at reaching the kingdom of Navarre and the protection of his\r\nbrother-in-law the king.\r\n\r\nAt the inn at Santander, where, weary and famished, they sat down to\r\ndine after one of the grooms had made arrangements for a boat, they had\r\na near escape of capture. The alcalde, hearing of the presence of these\r\nstrangers, and his suspicions being aroused by the recklessly high price\r\nthey had agreed to pay the owner of the vessel which they had engaged,\r\ncame to examine them. But they had a tale ready that they were\r\nwheat-merchants in great haste to reach Bernico, that a cargo of wheat\r\nawaited them there, and that they would suffer great loss by delay. The\r\ntale was smooth enough to satisfy the alcalde, and they were allowed to\r\ndepart. They reached Castro Urdiales safely, but were delayed there for\r\ntwo days, owing to the total lack of horses; and they were forced, in\r\nthe end, to proceed upon mules obtained from a neighbouring convent. On\r\nthese they rode to Durango, where they procured two fresh mules and\r\na horse, and so, after further similar vicissitudes, they arrived at\r\nPampeluna on December 3, 1506, and Cesare startled the Court of his\r\nbrother-in-law, King Jean of Navarre, by suddenly appearing in it--“like\r\nthe devil.”\r\n\r\nThe news of his evasion had already spread to Italy and set it in\r\na ferment, inspiring actual fear at the Vatican. The Romagna was\r\nencouraged by it to break out into open and armed insurrection against\r\nthe harsh rule of Julius II--who seems to have been rendered positively\r\nvindictive towards the Romagnuoli by their fidelity to Valentinois.\r\nThus had the Romagna fallen again into the old state of insufferable\r\noppression from which Cesare had once delivered it. The hopes of the\r\nRomagnuoli rose in a measure, as the alarm spread among the enemies of\r\nCesare--for Florence and Venice shared now the anxiety of the Vatican.\r\nZurita, commenting upon this state of things, pays Cesare the following\r\ncompliment, which the facts confirm as just:\r\n\r\n“The duke was such that his very presence was enough to set all Italy\r\nagog; and he was greatly beloved, not only by men of war, but also by\r\nmany people of Tuscany and of the States of the Church.”\r\n\r\nCesare’s wife--Charlotte d’Albret--whom he had not seen since that\r\nSeptember of 1499, was at Bourges at the Court of her friend, the\r\nsaintly, repudiated first wife of Louis XII. It is to be supposed that\r\nshe would be advised of her husband’s presence at her brother’s Court;\r\nbut there is no information on this score, nor do we know that they ever\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nWithin four days of reaching Pampeluna Cesare dispatched his secretary\r\nFederico into Italy to bear the news of his escape to his sister\r\nLucrezia at Ferrara, and a letter to Francesco Gonzaga, of Mantua, which\r\nwas little more than one of introduction, the more important matters to\r\nbe conveyed to Gonzaga going, no doubt, by word of mouth. Federico was\r\narrested at Bologna by order of Julius II, after he had discharged his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nFrance was now Cesare’s only hope, and he wrote to Louis begging his\r\nroyal leave to come to take his rank as a prince of that country, and to\r\nserve her.\r\n\r\nYou may justly have opined, long since, that the story here set down is\r\none never-ending record of treacheries and betrayals. But you will\r\nfind little to surpass the one to come. The behaviour of Louis at this\r\njuncture is contemptible beyond words, obeying as it does the maxim\r\nof that age, which had it that no inconvenient engagement should be\r\nobserved if there was opportunity for breaking it.\r\n\r\nFollowing this detestable maxim, Louis XII had actually gone the\r\nlength of never paying to Charlotte d’Albret the dot of 100,000 livres\r\nTournois, to which he had engaged himself by written contract. When\r\nCesare, in prison at Medina and in straits for money, had solicited\r\npayment through his brother-in-law of Navarre, his claim had been\r\ncontemptuously disregarded.\r\n\r\nBut there was worse to follow. Louis now answered Cesare’s request for\r\nleave to come to France by a letter (quoted in full by M. Yriarte from\r\nthe Archives des Basses Pyrénées) in which his Very Christian Majesty\r\nannounces that the duchy of Valentinois and the County of Dyois have\r\nbeen restored to the crown of France, as also the lordship of Issoudun.\r\nAnd then follows the pretext, of whose basely paltry quality you shall\r\njudge for yourselves. It runs:\r\n\r\n“After the decease of the late Pope Alexander, when our people and our\r\narmy were seeking the recovery of the kingdom of Naples, he [Cesare]\r\nwent over to the side of our enemies, serving, favouring, and assisting\r\nthem at arms and otherwise against ourselves and our said people and\r\narmy, which resulted to us in great and irrecoverable loss.”\r\n\r\nThe climax is in the deliberate falsehood contained in the closing\r\nwords. Poor Cesare, who had served France at her call--in spite of\r\nwhat was rumoured of his intentions--as long as he had a man-at-arms\r\nto follow him, had gone to Naples only in the hour of his extreme need.\r\nTrue, he had gone to offer himself to Spain as a condottiero when naught\r\nelse was left to him; but he took no army with him--he went alone, a\r\nservant, not an ally, as that false letter pretends. He had never\r\ncome to draw his sword against France, and certainly no loss had been\r\nsuffered by France in consequence of any action of his. Louis’s army was\r\ndefinitely routed at Garigliano, with Cesare’s troops fighting in its\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nBut Pope Alexander was dead; Cesare’s might in in Italy was dissipated;\r\nhis credit gone. There lay no profit for Louis in keeping faith with\r\nhim; there lay some profit in breaking it. Alas, that a king should\r\nstain his honour with base and vulgar lies to minister to his cupidity,\r\nand that he should set them down above his seal and signature to shame\r\nhim through centuries still in the womb of Time!\r\n\r\nCesare Borgia, landless, without right to any title, he that had held so\r\nmany, betrayed and abandoned on every side, had now nothing to offer in\r\nthe world’s market but his stout sword and his glad courage. These went\r\nto the first bidder for them, who happened to be his brother-in-law King\r\nJean.\r\n\r\nNavarre at the time was being snarled and quarrelled over by France and\r\nSpain, both menacing its independence, each pretending to claims upon it\r\nwhich do not, in themselves, concern us.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the country itself was torn by two factions--the Beaumontes\r\nand the Agramontes--and it was entrusted to Cesare to restore Navarre\r\nto peace and unity at home before proceeding--with the aid upon which\r\nhe depended from the Emperor Maximilian--to deal with the enemies beyond\r\nher frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Viana was being held by Louis de Beaumont--chief of the\r\nfaction that bore his name--and refused to surrender to the king.\r\nTo reduce it and compel Beaumont to obedience went Cesare as\r\nCaptain-General of Navarre, early in February of 1507. He commanded a\r\nconsiderable force, some 10,000 strong, and with this and his cannon he\r\nlaid siege to the citadel.\r\n\r\nThe natural strength of the place was such as might have defied any\r\nattempt to reduce it by force; but victuals were running low, and there\r\nwas every likelihood of its being speedily starved into surrender. To\r\nfrustrate this, Beaumont conceived the daring plan of attempting to send\r\nin supplies from Mendavia. The attempt being made secretly, by night and\r\nunder a strong escort, was entirely successful; but, in retreating, the\r\nBeaumontese were surprised in the dawn of that February morning by a\r\ntroop of reinforcements coming to Cesare’s camp. These, at sight of the\r\nrebels, immediately gave the alarm.\r\n\r\nThe most hopeless confusion ensued in the town, where it was at once\r\nimagined that a surprise attack was being made upon the Royalists, and\r\nthat they had to do with the entire rebel army.\r\n\r\nCesare, being aroused by the din and the blare of trumpets calling men\r\nto arms, sprang for his weapons, armed himself in haste, flung himself\r\non a horse, and, without pausing so much as to issue a command to his\r\nwaiting men-at-arms, rode headlong down the street to the Puerta del\r\nSol. Under the archway of the gate his horse stumbled and came down with\r\nhim. With an oath, Cesare wrenched the animal to its feet again, gave\r\nit the spur, and was away at a mad, furious gallop in pursuit of the\r\nretreating Beaumont rearguard.\r\n\r\nThe citizens, crowding to the walls of Viana, watched that last reckless\r\nride of his with amazed, uncomprehending eyes. The peeping sun caught\r\nhis glittering armour as he sped, so that of a sudden he must have\r\nseemed to them a thing of fire--meteoric, as had been his whole life’s\r\ntrajectory which was now swiftly dipping to its nadir.\r\n\r\nWhether he was frenzied with the lust of battle, riding in the reckless\r\nmanner that was his wont, confident that his men followed, yet too\r\nself-centred to ascertain, or whether--as seems more likely--it was\r\nsimply that his horse had bolted with him, will never be known until all\r\nthings are known.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was upon the rearguard of the fleeing rebels. His sword\r\nflashed up and down; again and again they may have caught the gleam\r\nof it from Viana’s walls, as he smote the foe. Irresistible as a\r\nthunderbolt, he clove himself a way through those Beaumontese. He was\r\nalone once more, a flying, dazzling figure of light, away beyond that\r\nrearguard which he left scathed and disordered by his furious passage.\r\nStill his mad career continued, and he bore down upon the main body of\r\nthe escort.\r\n\r\nBeaumont sat his horse to watch, in such amazement as you may conceive,\r\nthe wild approach of this unknown rider.\r\n\r\nSeeing him unsupported, some of the count’s men detached themselves\r\nto return and meet this single foe and oblige him with the death he so\r\nobviously appeared to seek.\r\n\r\nThey hedged him about--we do not know their number--and, engaging him,\r\nthey drew him from the road and down into the hollow space of a ravine.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in the thirty-second year of his age, and in all the glory of\r\nhis matchless strength, his soul possessed of the lust of combat, sword\r\nin hand, warding off the attack that rains upon him, and dealing death\r\nabout him, he meets his end. From the walls of Viana his resplendent\r\narmour renders him still discernible, until, like a sun to its setting,\r\nhe passes below the rim of that ravine, and is lost to the watcher’s\r\nview.\r\n\r\nDeath awaited him amid the shadows of that hollow place.\r\n\r\nUnhorsed by now, he fought with no concern for the odds against him,\r\nand did sore execution upon his assailants, ere a sword could find an\r\nopening in his guard to combine with a gap in his armour and so drive\r\nhome. That blade had found, maybe, his lungs. Still he swung his sword,\r\nswaying now upon his loosening knees. His mouth was full of blood.\r\nIt was growing dark. His hands began to fail him. He reeled like a\r\ndrunkard, sapped of strength, and then the end came quickly. Blows\r\nunwarded showered upon him now.\r\n\r\nHe crashed down in all the glory of his rich armour, which those\r\nbrigand-soldiers already coveted. And thus he died--mercifully,\r\nmaybe happily, for he had no time in which to taste the bitterness of\r\ndeath--that awful draught which he had forced upon so many.\r\n\r\nWithin a few moments of his falling, this man who had been a living\r\nforce, whose word had carried law from the Campagna to the Bolognese,\r\nwas so much naked, blood-smeared carrion--for those human vultures\r\nstripped him to the skin; his very shirt must they have. And there,\r\na stark, livid corpse, of no more account than any dog that died\r\nlast Saturday, they left Cesare Borgia of France, Duke of Romagna and\r\nValentinois, Prince of Andria, and Lord of a dozen Tyrannies.\r\n\r\nThe body was found there anon by those who so tardily rode after their\r\nleader, and his dismayed troopers bore those poor remains to Viana.\r\nThe king, arriving there that very day, horror-stricken at the news and\r\nsight that awaited him, ordered Cesare a magnificent funeral, and so he\r\nwas laid to rest before the High Altar of Sainte Marie de Viane.\r\n\r\nTo rest? May the soul of him rest at least, for men--Christian men--have\r\nrefused to vouchsafe that privilege to his poor ashes.\r\n\r\nNearly two hundred years later--at the close of the seventeenth century,\r\na priest of God and a bishop, one who preached a gospel of love and\r\nmercy so infinite that he dared believe by its lights no man to have\r\nbeen damned, came to disturb the dust of Cesare Borgia. This Bishop\r\nof Calahorra--lineal descendant in soul of that Pharisee who exalted\r\nhimself in God’s House, thrilled with titillations of delicious horror\r\nat the desecrating presence of the base publican--had his pietist’s eyes\r\noffended by the slab that marked Cesare Borgia’s resting-place.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  1  It bore the following legend:\r\n\r\n     AQUI YACE EN POCA TIERRA\r\n     AL QUE TODO LE TEMIA\r\n     EL QUE LA PAZ Y LA GUERRA\r\n     EN LA SUA MANO TENIA.\r\n     OH TU QUE VAS A BUSCAR\r\n     COSAS DIGNAS DE LOAR\r\n     SI TU LOAS LO MAS DIGNO\r\n     AQUI PARE TU CAMINO\r\n     NO CURES DE MAS ANDAR.\r\n\r\nwhich, more or less literally may be Englished as follows: “Here in a\r\nlittle earth, lies one whom all did fear; one whose hands dispensed both\r\npeace and war. Oh, you that go in search of things deserving praise,\r\nif you would praise the worthiest, then let your journey end here, nor\r\ntrouble to go farther.”\r\n\r\nThe pious, Christian bishop had read of this man--perhaps that life\r\nof him published by the apostate Gregorio Leti under the pen-name of\r\nTommaso Tommasi, which had lately seen the light--and he ordered the\r\ntomb’s removal from that holy place. And thus it befell that the ashes\r\nof Cesare Borgia were scattered and lost.\r\n\r\nCharlotte d’Albret was bereft of her one friend, Queen Jeanne, in that\r\nsame year of Cesare’s death. The Duchess of Valentinois withdrew to La\r\nMotte­Feuilly, and for the seven years remaining of her life was never\r\nseen other than in mourning; her very house was equipped with sombre,\r\nfunereal furniture, and so maintained until her end, which supports the\r\nview that she had conceived affection and respect for the husband of\r\nwhom she had seen so little.\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 1514, that poor lady passed from a life which appears to\r\nhave offered her few joys.\r\n\r\nLouise de Valentinois--a handsome damsel of the age of\r\nfourteen--remained for three years under the tutelage of the Duchess of\r\nAngoulême--the mother of King Francis I--to whom Charlotte d’Albret had\r\nentrusted her child. Louise married, at the age of seventeen, Louis de\r\nla Trémouille, Prince de Talmont and Vicomte de Thouars, known as the\r\nKnight Sans Peur et Sans Reproche. She maintained some correspondence\r\nwith her aunt, Lucrezia Borgia, whom she had never seen, and ever signed\r\nherself “Louise de Valentinois.” At the age of thirty--Trémouille having\r\nbeen killed at Pavia--she married, in second nuptials, Philippe de\r\nBourbon-Busset.\r\n\r\nLucrezia died in 1519, one year after her mother, Vanozza de’Catanei,\r\nwith whom she corresponded to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIESCANT!",
