I must ask, however, for complete\r\nacquittal on the charge of dilatoriness or want of energy. I was\r\nwriting the story of the Burgos Campaign in July 1914: in August the\r\nGreat War broke out: and like every one else I applied for service\r\nin any capacity in which a man of fifty-four could be useful. By\r\nSeptember 4th I was hard at work in Whitehall, and by a queer chance\r\nwas the person who on September 12th drafted from very inadequate\r\nmaterial the long _communiqué_ concerning the battle of the Marne. For\r\nfour years and six months I was busy in one office and another, and\r\nended up my service by writing the narrative of the Outbreak of the\r\nWar, which was published by the Foreign Office in February 1919. My\r\ntoils at the desk had just finished when it happened that I was sent\r\nto the House of Commons, as Burgess representing the University of\r\nOxford, after a by-election caused by the elevation of my predecessor,\r\nRowland Prothero, to the Upper Chamber. Two long official tours in the\r\nRhineland and in France combined with parliamentary work to prevent me\r\nwriting a word in 1919. But in the recess of 1920 I was able to find\r\ntime to recommence Peninsular War studies, and this volume was finished\r\nin the autumn and winter of 1921 and sent to the press in January 1922.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that in the years immediately preceding the Great\r\nWar I had been taking repeated turns round the Iberian Peninsula, so\r\nthat the topography of very nearly all the campaigns with which this\r\nvolume deals was familiar to me. I had marvelled at the smallness of\r\nthe citadel of Burgos, and the monotony of the plains across which\r\nWellington’s retreat of 1812 was conducted. I had watched the rapid\r\nflow of the Zadorra beside Vittoria, marked the narrowness of the front\r\nof attack at St. Sebastian, and admired the bold scenery of the lower\r\nBidassoa. Moreover, on the East Coast I had stood on the ramparts\r\nof Tarragona, and wondered at the preposterous operations against\r\nthem which Sir John Murray directed. But there are two sections of\r\nthis volume in which I cannot speak as one who has seen the land. My\r\ntravels had never taken me to the Alicante country, or the scene of the\r\nisolated and obscure battle of Castalla. And--what is more important--I\r\nhave never tramped over Soult’s route from Roncesvalles to the gates\r\nof Pampeluna, or from Sorauren to Echalar. Such an excursion I had\r\nplanned in company with my good friend Foster Cunliffe, our All Souls\r\nReader in Military History, who fell on the Somme in 1916, and I had no\r\ngreat desire to think of making it without him. Moreover, the leisure\r\nof the times before 1914 is now denied me. So for the greater part\r\nof the ten-days’ Campaign of the Pyrenees I have been dependent for\r\ntopography on the observations of others--which I regret. But it would\r\nhave been absurd to delay the publication of this volume for another\r\nyear or more, on the chance of being able to go over the ground in some\r\nuncovenanted scrap of holiday.\r\n\r\nI have, as in previous cases, to make due acknowledgement of much\r\nkind help from friends in the completion of this piece of work. First\r\nand foremost my thanks are due to my Oxford colleague in the History\r\nSchool, Mr. C. T. Atkinson of Exeter College, who found time during\r\nsome particularly busy weeks to go over my proofs with his accustomed\r\naccuracy. His criticism was always valuable, and I made numerous\r\nchanges in the text in deference to his suggestions. As usual, his\r\nwonderful knowledge of British regimental history enabled me to correct\r\nmany slips and solecisms, and to make many statements clearer by an\r\nalteration of words and phrases. I am filled with gratitude when I\r\nthink how he exerted himself to help me in the midst his own absorbing\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding volumes of this work I had not the advantage of being\r\nable to read the parts of the Hon. John Fortescue’s _History of the\r\nBritish Army_ which referred to the campaigns with which I was dealing.\r\nFor down to 1914 I was some way ahead of him in the tale of years.\r\nBut his volumes of 1921 took him past me, even as far as Waterloo,\r\nso that I had the opportunity of reading his accounts of Vittoria\r\nand the Pyrenees while I was writing my own version. This was always\r\nprofitable--I am glad to think that we agree on all that is essential,\r\nthough we may sometimes differ on matters of detail. But this is not\r\nthe most important part of the aid that I owe to Mr. Fortescue. He was\r\ngood enough to lend me the whole of his transcripts from the French\r\nArchives dealing with the Campaign of 1813, whereby I was saved a\r\nvisit to Paris and much tedious copying of statistics and excerpting\r\nfrom dispatches. My own work at the _Archives Nationales_ and the\r\nMinistry of War had only taken me down to the end of 1812. This was\r\na most friendly act, and saved me many hours of transcription. There\r\nare few authors who are so liberal and thoughtful for the benefit of\r\ntheir colleagues in study. It will be noted in the Appendix that quite\r\na large proportion of my statistics come from papers lent me by Mr.\r\nFortescue.\r\n\r\nAs to other sources now first utilized in print, I have to thank Mr. W.\r\nS. D’Urban of Newport House for the loan of the diary of his ancestor\r\nSir Benjamin D’Urban--most valuable for the Burgos retreat, especially\r\nfor the operations of Hill’s column. Another diary and correspondence,\r\nwhich was all-important for my last volume, runs dry as a source after\r\nthe first months of 1813. These were the papers of Sir George Scovell,\r\nWellington’s cypher-secretary, from which so many quotations may be\r\nfound in volume V. But after he left head-quarters and took charge of\r\nthe newly formed Military Police [‘Staff Corps Cavalry’] in the spring\r\nbefore Vittoria, he lost touch with the lines of information on which\r\nhe had hitherto been so valuable. I owe the very useful reports of the\r\nSpanish Fourth Army, and the Marching Orders of General Giron, to the\r\nkindness of Colonel Juan Arzadun, who caused them to be typed and sent\r\nto me from Madrid. By their aid I was able to fill up all the daily\r\n_étapes_ of the Galician corps, and to throw some new light on its\r\noperations in Biscay.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Leonard Atkinson, M.C., of the Record Office, I must give a\r\nspecial word of acknowledgement, which I repeat on page 753, for\r\ndiscovering the long-lost ‘morning states’ of Wellington’s army\r\nin 1813, which his thorough acquaintance with the shelves of his\r\ndepartment enabled him to find for me, after they had been divorced\r\nfor at least three generations from the dispatches to which they had\r\noriginally belonged. Tied up unbound between two pieces of cardboard,\r\nthey had eluded all previous seekers. We can at last give accurately\r\nthe strength of every British and Portuguese brigade at Vittoria and in\r\nthe Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nI could have wished that the times permitted authors to be as liberal\r\nwith maps as they were before the advent of post-war prices. I would\r\ngladly have added detailed plans of the combats of Venta del Pozo and\r\nTolosa to my illustrations. And I am sorry that for maps of Tarragona,\r\nand Catalonia generally, I must refer readers back to my fourth volume.\r\nBut books of research have now to be equipped with the lowest possible\r\nminimum of plates, or their price becomes prohibitive. I do not think\r\nthat anything really essential for the understanding of localities has\r\nbeen left out. I ought perhaps to mention that my reconstructions of\r\nthe topography of Maya and Roncesvalles owe much to the sketch-maps in\r\nGeneral Beatson’s _Wellington in the Pyrenees_, the only modern plans\r\nwhich have any value.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I must express, now for the sixth time, to the compiler of\r\nthe Index my heartfelt gratitude for a laborious task executed with her\r\nusual untiring patience and thoroughness.\r\n\r\n  CHARLES OMAN.\r\n\r\n  OXFORD,\r\n  _June_ 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  SECTION XXXIV\r\n\r\n  THE BURGOS CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER      PAGE\r\n\r\n  I.

But the end was not yet: when Wellington entered Madrid in\r\ntriumph on August 12th, the deliverance of the Peninsula was no more\r\ncertain than was the deliverance of Europe when the French Emperor\r\nevacuated Moscow on October 22nd. Vittoria and Leipzig were still a\r\nyear away, and it was not till they had been fought and won that the\r\nvictory of the Allies was secure. The resources of the great enemy were\r\nso immense that it required more than one disaster to exhaust them.\r\nNo one was more conscious of this than Wellington. Reflecting on the\r\nrelative numbers of his own Anglo-Portuguese army and of the united\r\nstrength of all the French corps in Spain, he felt that the occupation\r\nof Madrid was rather a _tour de force_, an admirable piece of political\r\npropaganda, than a decisive event. It would compel all the scattered\r\narmies of the enemy to unite against him, and he was more than doubtful\r\nwhether he could make head against them. ‘I still hope,’ he wrote to\r\nhis brother Henry, the Ambassador at Cadiz, ‘to maintain our position\r\nin Castile, and even to improve our advantages. But I shudder when I\r\nreflect upon the enormity of the task which I have undertaken, with\r\ninadequate powers myself to do anything, and without assistance of any\r\nkind from the Spaniards[1].... I am apprehensive that all this may\r\nturn out but ill for the Spanish cause. If, for any cause, I should be\r\noverpowered, or should be obliged to retreat, what will the world say?\r\nWhat will the people of England say?... That we made a great effort,\r\nattended by some glorious circumstances; that from January 1st, 1812,\r\nwe had gained more advantages for the cause, and had acquired more\r\nextent of territory by our operations than any army ever gained in such\r\na period of time against so powerful an enemy; but that unaided by the\r\nSpanish army and government, we were finally overpowered, and compelled\r\nto withdraw within our old frontier.’\r\n\r\nIt was with no light heart that Wellington faced the strategical\r\nproblem. In outline it stood as follows. Soult was now known to be\r\nevacuating Andalusia, and it was practically certain that he would\r\nretire on Valencia, where he would join King Joseph and Suchet. Their\r\nthree armies would produce a mass of veteran troops so great that even\r\nif every division of the Anglo-Portuguese army were concentrated, if\r\nHill came up from Estremadura and Skerrett’s small force from Cadiz, it\r\nwould be eminently doubtful whether Madrid could be held and the enemy\r\nthrust back. The French might advance 85,000 strong, and Wellington\r\ncould only rely on 60,000 men of his own to face them--though he\r\nmight scrape together three or four divisions of Spanish troops in\r\naddition[2]. It was true that Suchet might probably refuse to evacuate\r\nhis Valencian viceroyalty, and that occupation for him might be found\r\nby utilizing Maitland’s expeditionary force at Alicante, and Elio’s\r\nMurcian army. But even if he did not join Soult and King Joseph in a\r\nmarch on Madrid, the armies of the South and Centre might put 65,000\r\nmen into the field.\r\n\r\nBut this was only half the problem. There was Clausel’s Army of\r\nPortugal, not to speak of Caffarelli’s Army of the North, to be\r\ntaken into consideration. Clausel had some 40,000 men behind the\r\nDouro--troops recently beaten it is true, and known to be in bad order.\r\nBut they had not been pursued since the Allied army turned aside for\r\nthe march on Madrid, and had now been granted a month in which to\r\npull themselves together. Nothing had been left in front of them save\r\nClinton’s 6th Division at Cuellar, and a division of the Galicians at\r\nValladolid. And now the vexatious news had come that Clausel was on\r\nthe move, had chased the Galicians out of Valladolid, and was sending\r\nflying columns into the plains of Leon. It was clear that he must be\r\ndealt with at once, and there was no way to stop his annoying activity,\r\nsave by detaching a considerable force from Madrid. If unopposed, he\r\nmight overrun all the reconquered lands along the Douro, and even\r\nimperil the British line of communication with Salamanca and Portugal.\r\nIf, as was possible, Caffarelli should lend him a couple of divisions\r\nfrom the Army of the North, he might become a real danger instead of a\r\nmere nuisance.\r\n\r\nThis was the reason why Wellington departed from Madrid on August 31st,\r\nand marched with the 1st, 5th and 7th Divisions, Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese, and Bock’s and Ponsonby’s dragoons--21,000 sabres and\r\nbayonets--to join Clinton, and thrust back Clausel to the North,\r\nbefore he should have leisure to do further mischief. There was, as\r\nhe conceived, just time enough to inflict a sharp check on the Army\r\nof Portugal before the danger from the side of Valencia would become\r\npressing. It must be pushed out of the way, disabled again if possible,\r\nand then he would return to Madrid for the greater game, leaving as\r\nsmall a containing force as possible in front of the Northern army. He\r\nsummed up his plan in a confidential letter in the following terms:\r\n‘All the world [the French world] seems to be intending to mass itself\r\nin Valencia; while I am waiting for their plans to develop, for General\r\nHill to march up from Estremadura, and for the Spanish armies to get\r\ntogether, I shall hunt away the elements of Marmont’s [i. e. Clausel’s]\r\narmy from the Douro. I shall push them as far off as I can, I shall\r\ntry to establish proper co-operation between the Anglo-Portuguese\r\ndetachment which I must leave on this side and the Galician Army,\r\nand so I shall assure my left flank, when I shall be engaged on the\r\nValencian side[3].’\r\n\r\nHere then, we have a time-problem set. Will it be possible to deal\r\nhandsomely with the Army of Portugal, to put it completely out of power\r\nto do harm, before Soult shall have reached Valencia, reorganized\r\nhis army, and joined King Joseph in what Wellington considered the\r\ninevitable scheme of a march on Madrid? The British general judged that\r\nthere would be sufficient time--and probably there might have been, if\r\neverything had worked out in the best possible way. But he was quite\r\nconscious that events might prove perverse--and he shuddered at the\r\nthought--as he wrote to his brother in Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThe last precautions taken before departing for the Douro were to\r\ndraw up three sets of instructions. One was for Charles Alten,\r\nleft in command of the four divisions which remained in and about\r\nMadrid[4], foreseeing the chance of Soult’s marching on the capital\r\nwithout turning aside to Valencia--‘not at all probable, but it is\r\nnecessary to provide for all events.’ The second was for Hill, who\r\nwas due to arrive at Toledo in about three weeks. The third was for\r\nGeneral Maitland at Alicante, whose position would obviously be very\r\nunpleasant, now that Soult was known to be evacuating Andalusia and\r\nmarching on Valencia to join Suchet and King Joseph. Soult’s march\r\naltered the whole situation on the East Coast: if 50,000 more French\r\nwere concentrated in that direction, the Alicante force must be in some\r\ndanger, and would have to observe great caution, and if necessary to\r\nshut itself up in the maritime fortresses. ‘As the allied forces in\r\nValencia and Murcia’--wrote Wellington to Maitland--‘will necessarily\r\nbe thrown upon the defensive for a moment, while the enemy will be in\r\ngreat strength in those parts, I conclude that the greater part of\r\nthose forces will be collected in Alicante, and it would be desirable\r\nto strengthen our posts at Cartagena during this crisis, which I hope\r\nwill be only momentary[5].’ Another dispatch, dated four days later,\r\nadverts to the possibility that Soult may fall upon Alicante on his\r\narrival in the kingdom of Valencia. Maitland is to defend the place,\r\nbut to take care that all precautions as to the embarking his troops\r\nin the event of ill-success are made. He is expected to maintain it as\r\nlong as possible; and with the sea open to him, and a safe harbour, the\r\ndefence should be long and stubborn, however great the numbers of the\r\nbesiegers[6].\r\n\r\nWith these instructions drawn out for Maitland, Wellington finally\r\nmarched for the North. His conception of the situation in Valencia\r\nseems to have been that Soult, on his arrival, would _not_ meddle with\r\nAlicante: it was more probable that he and King Joseph would rather\r\ntake up the much more important task of endeavouring to reconquer\r\nMadrid and New Castile. They would leave Suchet behind them to contain\r\nMaitland, Elio and Ballasteros. It would be impossible for him to lend\r\nthem any troops for a march on Madrid, while such a large expeditionary\r\nforce was watching his flank. The net result would be that ‘by keeping\r\nthis detachment at Alicante, with Whittingham’s and Roche’s Spaniards,\r\nI shall prevent too many of the gentlemen now assembled in Valencia\r\nfrom troubling me in the Upper Country [New Castile][7].’\r\n\r\nTravelling with his usual celerity, Wellington left Madrid on August\r\n31st, was at Villa Castin on the northern side of the Guadarrama pass\r\non September 2nd, and had reached Arevalo, where he joined Clinton and\r\nthe 6th Division on September 3rd. The divisions which he was bringing\r\nup from Madrid had been started off some days before he himself left\r\nthe capital. He passed them between the Escurial and Villa Castin, but\r\nthey caught him up again at Arevalo early on the 4th, so that he had\r\nhis fighting force concentrated on that day, and was prepared to deal\r\nwith Clausel.\r\n\r\nThe situation of affairs on the Douro requires a word of explanation.\r\nClausel, it will be remembered, had retired from Valladolid on July\r\n30, unpursued. He was prepared to retreat for any length--even as far\r\nas Burgos--if he were pressed. But no one followed him save Julian\r\nSanchez’s lancers and some patrols of Anson’s Light Cavalry brigade.\r\nWherefore he halted his main body on the line of the Arlanza, with two\r\ndivisions at Torquemada and two at Lerma; some way to his left Foy,\r\nwith two divisions more, was at Aranda, on the Upper Douro, where he\r\nhad maintained his forward position, because not even a cavalry patrol\r\nfrom the side of the Allies had come forward to disquiet him. In front\r\nof Clausel himself there was soon nothing left but the lightest of\r\ncavalry screens, for Julian Sanchez was called off by Wellington to\r\nNew Castile: when he was gone, there remained Marquinez’s guerrilleros\r\nat Palencia, and outposts of the 16th Light Dragoons at Valtanas:\r\nthe main body of G. Anson’s squadrons lay at Villavanez, twenty\r\nmiles behind[8]. The only infantry force which the Allies had north\r\nof the Douro was one of the divisions of the Army of Galicia, which\r\n(with Santocildes himself in command) came up to Valladolid on August\r\n6th, not much over 3,000 bayonets strong. The second of the Galician\r\ndivisions which had descended into the plain of Leon was now blockading\r\nToro. The third and most numerous was still engaged in the interminable\r\nsiege of Astorga, which showed at last some signs of drawing to its\r\nclose--not because the battering of the place had been effective,\r\nbut simply because the garrison was growing famished. They had been\r\nprovisioned only as far as August 1, and after that date had been\r\nforced upon half and then quarter rations. But the news of the disaster\r\nof Salamanca had not, as many had hoped among the Allies, scared their\r\ncommander into capitulation.\r\n\r\nClausel on August 1 had not supposed it possible that he would be\r\ntempted to take the offensive again within a fortnight. His army was\r\nin a most dilapidated condition, and he was prepared to give way\r\nwhenever pressed. It was not that his numbers were so very low, for on\r\nAugust 1st the Army of Portugal only counted 10,000 less effectives\r\nthan on July 15th. Though it had lost some 14,000 men in the Salamanca\r\ncampaign, it had picked up some 4,000 others from the dépôt at\r\nValladolid, from the many small garrisons which it had drawn in during\r\nits retreat, and from drafts found at Burgos.[9] Its loss in cavalry\r\nhad been fully repaired by the arrival of Chauvel’s two regiments from\r\nthe Army of the North, and most of the fugitives and marauders who\r\nhad been scattered over the countryside after the battle of July 22nd\r\ngradually drifted back to their colours. It was not so much numbers\r\nas spirit that was wanting in the Army of Portugal. On August 6\r\nClausel wrote to the Minister of War at Paris that he had halted in a\r\nposition where he could feed the troops, give them some days of repose,\r\nand above all re-establish their morale[10]. ‘I must punish some of\r\nthe men, who are breaking out in the most frightful outrages, and so\r\nfrighten the others by an example of severity; above all I must put\r\nan end to a desire, which they display too manifestly, to recross the\r\nEbro, and get back nearer to the French frontier. It is usual to see an\r\narmy disheartened after a check: but it would be hard to find one whose\r\ndiscouragement is greater than that of these troops: and I cannot, and\r\nought not, to conceal from you that there has been prevailing among\r\nthem for some time a very bad spirit. Disorders and revolting excesses\r\nhave marked every step of our retreat. I shall employ all the means\r\nin my power to transform the dispositions of the soldiers, and to put\r\nan end to the deplorable actions which daily take place under the\r\nvery eyes of officers of all grades--actions which the latter fail to\r\nrepress.’\r\n\r\nClausel was as good as his word, and made many and severe examples,\r\nshooting (so he says) as many as fifty soldiers found guilty of\r\nmurders, assaults on officers, and other excesses[11]. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that it was not so much his strong punitive measures which\r\nbrought about an improved discipline in the regiments, as the fortnight\r\nof absolutely undisturbed repose which they enjoyed from the 1st to the\r\n14th of August. The feeling of demoralization caused by the headlong\r\nand disorderly retreat from Salamanca died down, as it became more and\r\nmore certain that the pursuit was over, and that there was no serious\r\nhostile force left within many miles of the line of the Arlanza. The\r\nobsession of being hunted by superior forces had been the ruinous\r\nthing: when this terror was withdrawn, and when the more shattered\r\nregiments had been re-formed into a smaller number of battalions, and\r\nprovided in this fashion with their proper proportion of officers[12],\r\nthe troops began to realize that they still formed a considerable\r\narmy, and that they had been routed, but not absolutely put out of\r\naction, by the Salamanca disaster.\r\n\r\nYet their morale had been seriously shaken; there was still a want of\r\nofficers; a number of the rejoining fugitives had come in without arms\r\nor equipment; while others had been heard of, but had not yet reported\r\nthemselves at their regimental head-quarters. It therefore required\r\nconsiderable hardihood on Clausel’s part to try an offensive move, even\r\nagainst a skeleton enemy. His object was primarily to bring pressure\r\nupon the allied rear, in order to relieve King Joseph from Wellington’s\r\nattentions. He had heard that the whole of the Anglo-Portuguese army,\r\nsave a negligible remnant, had marched on Madrid; but he was not sure\r\nthat the Army of the Centre might not make some endeavour to save the\r\ncapital, especially if it had been reinforced from Estremadura by\r\nDrouet. Clausel knew that the King had repeatedly called for succours\r\nfrom the South; it was possible that they might have been sent at the\r\nlast moment. If they had come up, and if Wellington could be induced\r\nto send back two or three divisions to the Douro, Madrid might yet be\r\nsaved. The experiment was worth risking, but it must take the form of\r\na demonstration rather than a genuine attack upon Wellington’s rear.\r\nThe Army of Portugal was still too fragile an instrument to be applied\r\nto heavy work. Indeed, when he moved, Clausel left many shattered\r\nregiments behind, and only brought 25,000 men to the front.\r\n\r\nThere was a second object in Clausel’s advance: he hoped to save the\r\ngarrisons of Astorga, Toro, and Zamora, which amounted in all to over\r\n3,000 men. Each of the first two was being besieged by a Spanish\r\ndivision, the third by Silveira’s Portuguese militia. The French\r\ngeneral judged that none of the investing forces was equal to a fight\r\nin the open with a strong flying column of his best troops. Even if\r\nall three could get together, he doubted if they dared face two French\r\ndivisions. His scheme was to march on Valladolid with his main body,\r\nand drive out of it the small Spanish force in possession, while\r\nFoy--his senior division-commander--should move rapidly across country\r\nwith some 8,000 men, and relieve by a circular sweep first Toro, then\r\nAstorga, then Zamora. The garrisons were to be brought off, the places\r\nblown up: it was useless to dream of holding them, for Wellington would\r\nprobably come to the Douro again in force, the sieges would recommence,\r\nand no second relief would be possible in face of the main British army.\r\n\r\nOn August 13th a strong French cavalry reconnaissance crossed the\r\nArlanza and drove in the guerrilleros from Zevico: on the following day\r\ninfantry was coming up from the rear, pushing forward on the high-road\r\nfrom Torquemada to Valladolid. Thereupon Anson, on that evening, sent\r\nback the main body of his light dragoons beyond the Douro, leaving only\r\ntwo squadrons as a rearguard at Villavanez. The Galician division in\r\nValladolid also retired by the road of Torrelobaton and Castronuevo\r\non Benavente. Santocildes--to Wellington’s disgust when it reached\r\nhis ears--abandoned in Valladolid not only 400 French convalescents\r\nin hospital, but many hundred stand of small arms, which had been\r\ncollected there from the prisoners taken during the retreat of Clausel\r\nin the preceding month. This was inexcusable carelessness, as there was\r\nample time to destroy them, if not to carry them off. French infantry\r\nentered Valladolid on the 14th and 15th, apparently about 12,000\r\nstrong: their cavalry, a day’s march ahead, had explored the line of\r\nthe Douro from Simancas to Tudela, and found it watched by G. Anson’s\r\npickets all along that front.\r\n\r\nThe orders left behind by Wellington on August 5th, had been that if\r\nClausel came forward--which he had not thought likely--G. Anson was\r\nto fall back to the Douro, and if pressed again to join Clinton’s\r\ndivision at Cuellar. The retreat of both of them was to be on Segovia\r\nin the event of absolute necessity. On the other hand, if the French\r\nshould try to raise the sieges of Astorga or Zamora, Santocildes and\r\nSilveira were to go behind the Esla[13]. Clausel tried both these moves\r\nat once, for on the same day that he entered Valladolid he had turned\r\noff Foy with two divisions--his own and Taupin’s (late Ferey’s)--and a\r\nbrigade of Curto’s _chasseurs_, to march on Toro by the road through\r\nTorrelobaton. The troops in Valladolid served to cover this movement:\r\nthey showed a division of infantry and 800 horse in front of Tudela\r\non the 16th, and pushed back Anson’s light dragoons to Montemayor, a\r\nfew miles beyond the Douro. But this was only a demonstration: their\r\ncavalry retired in the evening, and Anson reoccupied Tudela on the\r\n20th. It soon became clear that Clausel was not about to cross the\r\nDouro in force, and was only showing troops in front of Valladolid in\r\norder to keep Anson and Clinton anxious. He remained there with some\r\n12,000 or 15,000 men from August 14th till September 7th, keeping very\r\nquiet, and making no second attempt to reconnoitre beyond the Douro.\r\nAnson, therefore, watched the line of the river, with his head-quarters\r\nat Valdestillas, for all that time, while the guerrilleros of Saornil\r\nand Principe went over to the northern bank and hung around Clausel’s\r\nflank. Clinton, on his own initiative, moved his division from Cuellar\r\nto Arevalo, which placed him on the line of the road to Madrid via the\r\nGuadarrama, instead of that by Segovia. This Wellington afterwards\r\ndeclared to be a mistake: he had intended to keep the 6th Division more\r\nto the right, apparently in order that it might cross the Douro above\r\nValladolid if required[14]. It should not have moved farther southward\r\nthan Olmedo.\r\n\r\nFoy meanwhile, thus covered by Clausel, made a march of surprising\r\ncelerity. On the 17th he arrived at Toro, and learned that the\r\nGalicians blockading that place had cleared off as early as the 15th,\r\nand had taken the road for Benavente. He blew up the fort, and took\r\non with him the garrison of 800 men. At Toro he was much nearer to\r\nZamora than to Astorga, but he resolved to march first on the remoter\r\nplace--it was known to be hard pressed, and the French force there\r\nblockaded was double that in Zamora. He therefore moved on Benavente\r\nwith all possible speed, and crossed the Esla there, driving away a\r\ndetachment of the Galician division (Cabrera’s) which had come from\r\nValladolid, when it made an ineffectual attempt to hold the fords. On\r\nthe 20th August he reached La Baneza, some sixteen miles from Astorga,\r\nand there received the tiresome news that the garrison had surrendered\r\nonly thirty-six hours before to Castaños. The three battalions there,\r\nworn down by famine to 1,200 men, had capitulated, because they had no\r\nsuspicion that any help was near. The Spanish general had succeeded in\r\nconcealing from them all knowledge of Foy’s march. They laid down their\r\narms on the 18th, and were at once marched off to Galicia: Castaños\r\nhimself accompanied them with all his force, being fully determined not\r\nto fight Foy, even though his numbers were superior.\r\n\r\nThe French cavalry pushed on to Astorga on the 21st, and found the\r\ngates open and the place empty, save for seventy sick of the late\r\ngarrison, who had been left behind under the charge of a surgeon.\r\nIt was useless to think of pursuing Castaños, who had now two days’\r\nstart, wherefore Foy turned his attention to Zamora. Here Silveira,\r\nthough warned to make off when the enemy reached Toro, had held on\r\nto the last moment, thinking that he was safe when Foy swerved away\r\ntoward Astorga. He only drew off when he got news on the 22nd, from Sir\r\nHoward Douglas, the British Commissioner with the Galician army, to the\r\neffect that Foy, having failed to save Astorga, was marching against\r\nhim. He retired to Carvajales behind the Esla, but was not safe there,\r\nfor the French general, turning west from Benavente, had executed a\r\nforced march for Tabara, and was hastening westward to cut in between\r\nCarvajales and the road to Miranda de Douro on the Portuguese frontier.\r\nWarned only just in time of this move, Silveira hurried off towards his\r\nown country, and was within one mile of its border when Foy’s advanced\r\ncavalry came up with his rearguard near Constantin, the last village\r\nin Spain. They captured his baggage and some stragglers, but made no\r\nserious endeavour to charge his infantry, which escaped unharmed to\r\nMiranda. Foy attributed this failure to Curto, the commander of the\r\nlight horse: ‘le défaut de décision et l’inertie coupable du général\r\ncommandant la cavalerie font perdre les fruits d’une opération bien\r\ncombinée’ (August 23rd)[15]. This pursuit had drawn Foy very far\r\nwestward; his column turning back, only reached Zamora on August\r\n26th: here he drew off the garrison and destroyed the works. He states\r\nthat his next move would have been a raid on Salamanca, where lay not\r\nonly the British base hospital, but a vast accumulation of stores,\r\nunprotected by any troops whatever. But he received at Zamora, on the\r\n27th, urgent orders from Clausel to return to Valladolid, as Wellington\r\nwas coming up against him from Madrid with his whole army. Accordingly\r\nFoy abandoned his plan, and reached Tordesillas, with his troops in a\r\nvery exhausted condition from hard marching, on August 28th. Clausel\r\nhad miscalculated dates--warned of the first start of the 1st and\r\n7th Divisions from Madrid, he had supposed that they would be at\r\nArevalo some days before they actually reached it on September 4th.\r\nFoy was never in any real danger, and there had been time to spare.\r\nHis excursion undoubtedly raised the spirit of the Army of Portugal:\r\nit was comforting to find that the whole of the Galicians would not\r\nface 8,000 French troops, and that the plains of Leon could be overrun\r\nwithout opposition by such a small force. On his return to join the\r\nmain body Foy noted in his diary that Clausel had been very inert in\r\nface of Anson and Clinton, and wrote that he himself would have tried\r\na more dashing policy--and might possibly have failed in it, owing to\r\nthe discouragement and apathy still prevailing among many of the senior\r\nofficers of the Army of Portugal[16].\r\n\r\nWellington had received the news of Clausel’s advance on Valladolid as\r\nearly as August 18th, and was little moved by it. Indeed he expressed\r\nsome pleasure at the fact. ‘I think,’ he wrote to Lord Bathurst, ‘that\r\nthe French mean to carry off the garrisons from Zamora and Toro, which\r\nI hope they will effect, as otherwise I must go and take them. If I do\r\nnot, nobody else will, as is evident from what has been passing for the\r\nlast two months at Astorga[17].’ He expressed his pleasure on hearing\r\nthat Santocildes had retired behind the Esla without fighting, for he\r\nhad feared that he might try to stop Foy and get beaten. It was only,\r\nas we have already seen, after he obtained practical certainty that\r\nSoult had evacuated Andalusia, so that no expedition to the South would\r\nbe necessary, that he turned his mind to Clausel‘s doings. And his\r\nmarch to Arevalo and Valladolid was intended to be a mere excursion for\r\na few weeks, preparatory to a return to New Castile to face Soult and\r\nKing Joseph, when they should become dangerous. From Arevalo he wrote\r\nto Castaños to say that ‘it was necessary to drive off Marmont’s (i.e.\r\nClausel’s) army without loss of time, so as to make it possible to turn\r\nthe whole of his forces eventually against Soult.’ He should press the\r\nmovement so far forward as he could; perhaps he might even lay siege\r\nto Burgos. But the Army of Galicia must come eastward again without\r\ndelay, and link up its operations with the Anglo-Portuguese. He hoped\r\nto have retaken Valladolid by September 6th, and wished to see Castaños\r\nthere, with the largest possible force that he could gather, on that\r\ndate[18]. The Galician army had returned to Astorga on August 27th, and\r\nso far as distances went, there was nothing to prevent it from being at\r\nValladolid eleven days after, if it took the obvious route by Benavente\r\nand Villalpando.\r\n\r\nThe troops from Madrid having joined Clinton and the 6th Division\r\nat Arevalo, Wellington had there some 28,000 men collected for the\r\ndiscomfiture of Clausel, a force not much more numerous than that which\r\nthe French general had concentrated behind the Douro, for Foy was now\r\nback at Tordesillas, and the whole Army of Portugal was in hand, save\r\ncertain depleted and disorganized regiments which had been left behind\r\nin the province of Burgos. But having the advantage of confidence, and\r\nknowing that his enemy must still be suffering from the moral effects\r\nof Salamanca, the British general pushed on at once, not waiting for\r\nthe arrival on the scene of the Galicians. On the 4th the army marched\r\nto Olmedo, on the 5th to Valdestillas, on the 6th to Boecillo, from\r\nwhence it advanced to the Douro and crossed it by various fords between\r\nTudela and Puente de Duero--the main body taking that of Herrera. The\r\nFrench made no attempt to defend the line of the river, but--rather\r\nto Wellington’s surprise--were found drawn up as if for battle a few\r\nmiles beyond it, their right wing holding the city of Valladolid, whose\r\noutskirts had been put in a state of defence, their left extending to\r\nthe ground about the village of La Cisterniga. No attempt was made\r\nto dislodge them with the first divisions that came up: Wellington\r\npreferred to wait for his artillery and his reserves; the process\r\nof filing across the fords had been tedious, and occupied the whole\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nOn this Clausel had calculated: he was only showing a front in\r\norder to give his train time to move to the rear, and to allow his\r\nright wing (Foy) at Simancas and Tordesillas to get away. A prompt\r\nevacuation of Valladolid would have exposed it to be cut off. On the\r\nfollowing morning the French had disappeared from La Cisterniga, but\r\nValladolid was discovered to be still held by an infantry rearguard.\r\nThis, when pushed, retired and blew up the bridge over the Pisuerga\r\non the opposite side of the city, before the British cavalry could\r\nseize it. The critics thought that Clausel might have been hustled\r\nwith advantage, both on the 6th and on the morning of the 7th, and\r\nthat Foy might have been cut off from the main body by rapid action\r\non the first day[19]. Wellington’s cautious movements may probably be\r\nexplained by the fact that an attack on Clausel on the 6th would have\r\ninvolved fighting among the suburbs and houses of Valladolid, which\r\nwould have been costly, and he had no wish to lose men at a moment when\r\nthe battalion-strengths were very low all through the army. Moreover,\r\nthe capture of Valladolid would not have intercepted the retreat of the\r\nFrench at Simancas, but only have forced them to retire by parallel\r\nroads northward. At the same time it must be owned that any loss of\r\nlife involved in giving Clausel a thorough beating on this day would\r\nhave been justified later on. He had only some 15,000 men in line, not\r\nhaving his right-wing troops with him that day. If the Army of Portugal\r\nhad been once more attacked and scattered, it would not have been able\r\nto interfere in the siege of Burgos, where Wellington was, during the\r\nnext few weeks, to lose as many men as a general action would have\r\ncost. But this no prophet could have foreseen on September 6th.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that Wellington’s pursuit of Clausel was pressed\r\nwith any earnestness. On the 8th his advanced cavalry were no farther\r\nforward than Cabezon, seven miles in front of Valladolid, and it\r\nwas not till the 9th that the 6th Division, leading the infantry,\r\npassed that same point. Wellington himself, with the main body of his\r\ninfantry, remained at Valladolid till the 10th. His dispatches give\r\nno further explanation for this delay than that the troops which had\r\ncome from Madrid were fatigued, and sickly, from long travel in the\r\nhot weather, and that he wished to have assurance of the near approach\r\nof the Army of Galicia, which was unaccountably slow in moving forward\r\nfrom Astorga[20]. Meanwhile he took the opportunity of his stay in\r\nValladolid to command, and be present at, a solemn proclamation of the\r\nMarch Constitution. This was a prudent act; for though the ceremony\r\nprovoked no enthusiasm whatever in the city[21], where there were\r\nfew Liberals in existence, it was a useful demonstration against\r\ncalumnies current in Cadiz, to the effect that he so much disliked the\r\nConstitution that he was conspiring with the _serviles_, and especially\r\nwith Castaños, to ignore or even to overthrow it.\r\n\r\nWhile Wellington halted at Valladolid, Clausel had established himself\r\nat Dueñas, fifteen miles up the Pisuerga. He retired from thence,\r\nhowever, on the 10th, when the 6th Division and Anson’s cavalry pressed\r\nin his advanced posts, and Wellington’s head-quarters were at Dueñas\r\nnext day. From thence reconnaissances were sent out both on the Burgos\r\nand the Palencia roads. The latter city was found unoccupied and--what\r\nwas more surprising--not in the least damaged by the retreating enemy.\r\nThe whole of Clausel’s army had marched on the Burgos road, and its\r\nrearguard was discovered in front of Torquemada that evening. The\r\nBritish army followed, leaving Palencia on its left, and head-quarters\r\nwere at Magaz on the 12th. Anson’s light dragoons had the interesting\r\nspectacle that afternoon of watching the whole French army defile\r\nacross the bridge of the Pisuerga at Torquemada, under cover of a\r\nbrigade of _chasseurs_ drawn up on the near side. Critics thought that\r\nthe covering force might have been driven in, and jammed against the\r\nnarrow roadway over the bridge[22]. But the British brigadier waited\r\nfor artillery to come up, and before it arrived the enemy had hastily\r\ndecamped. He was pursued as far as Quintana, where there was a trifling\r\ncavalry skirmish at nightfall.\r\n\r\nAt Magaz, on the night of the 12th, Wellington got the tiresome\r\nnews that Santocildes and Castaños, with the main body of the Army\r\nof Galicia, had passed his flank that day, going southward, and had\r\ncontinued their way towards Valladolid, instead of falling in on the\r\nBritish line of march. Their junction was thus deferred for several\r\ndays. Wellington wrote in anger, ‘Santocildes has been six days\r\nmarching: he was yesterday within three leagues of us, and knew it that\r\nnight; but he has this morning moved on to Valladolid, eight leagues\r\nfrom us, and unless I halt two days for him he will not join us for\r\nfour or five days more[23].’ As a matter of fact the Galicians did not\r\ncome up till the 16th, while if Santocildes had used a little common\r\nsense they would have been in line on the 12th September.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of Clausel continued to be a very slow and uninteresting\r\nbusiness: from the 11th to the 15th the army did not advance more\r\nthan two leagues a day. On the 13th the British vanguard was at\r\nVillajera, while the French main body was at Pampliega: on the 14th\r\nAnson’s cavalry was at Villadrigo, on the 15th at Villapequeña, on\r\nthe 16th near Celada, where Clausel was seen in position. On this day\r\nthe Galicians at last came up--three weak divisions under Cabrera,\r\nLosada, and Barcena, with something over 11,000 infantry, but only one\r\nfield-battery and 350 horse. The men looked fatigued with much marching\r\nand very ragged: Wellington had hoped for 16,000 men, and considering\r\nthat the total force of the Galician army was supposed to be over\r\n30,000 men, it seems that more might have been up, even allowing for\r\nsick, recruits, and the large garrisons of Ferrol and Corunna.\r\n\r\nThe 16th September was the only day on which Clausel showed any signs\r\nof making a stand: in the afternoon he was found in position, a league\r\nbeyond Celada on favourable ground. Wellington arranged to turn his\r\nleft flank next morning, with the 6th Division and Pack’s brigade; but\r\nat dawn he went off in haste, and did not stop till he reached Villa\r\nBuniel, near Burgos. Here, late in the afternoon, Wellington again\r\noutflanked him with the 6th Division, and he retreated quite close to\r\nthe city. On the 18th he evacuated it, after throwing a garrison into\r\nthe Castle, and went back several leagues on the high-road toward the\r\nEbro. The Allies entered Burgos, and pushed their cavalry beyond it\r\nwithout meeting opposition. On the 19th the Castle was invested by the\r\n1st Division and Pack’s brigade, while the rest of Wellington’s army\r\ntook position across the road by which the French had retreated. A\r\ncavalry reconnaissance showed that Clausel had gone back many miles:\r\nthe last outposts of his rear were at Quintanavides, beyond the\r\nwatershed which separates the basin of the Douro from that of the Ebro.\r\nHis head-quarters were now at Briviesca, and it appeared that, if once\r\nmore pushed, he was prepared to retreat _ad infinitum_. Wellington,\r\nhowever, pressed him no farther: throwing forward three of his own\r\ndivisions and the Galicians to Monasterio and other villages to the\r\neast of Burgos, where a good covering position was found, he proceeded\r\nto turn his attention to the Castle.\r\n\r\nThis short series of operations between the 10th and the 19th of\r\nSeptember 1812 has in it much that perplexes the critical historian.\r\nIt is not Clausel’s policy that is interesting--he simply retired\r\nday after day, whenever the enemy’s pursuing infantry came within\r\nten miles of him. Sometimes he gave way before the mere cavalry of\r\nWellington’s advanced guard. There was nothing in his conduct to\r\nremind the observer of Ney’s skilful retreat from Pombal to Ponte\r\nMurcella in 1811, when a rearguard action was fought nearly every\r\nafternoon. Clausel was determined not to allow himself to be caught,\r\nand would not hold on, even in tempting positions of considerable\r\nstrength. As he wrote to Clarke before the retreat had begun, ‘Si\r\nl’ennemi revient avec toute son armée vers moi, je me tiendrai en\r\nposition, quoique toujours à peu de distance de lui, afin de n’avoir\r\naucun échec à éprouver.’ He suffered no check because he always made\r\noff before he was in the slightest danger of being brought to action.\r\nIt is difficult to understand Napier’s enthusiasm for what he calls\r\n‘beautiful movements’[24]; to abscond on the first approach of the\r\nenemy’s infantry may be a safe and sound policy, but it can hardly be\r\ncalled brilliant or artistic. It is true that there would have been\r\nworse alternatives to take--Clausel might have retreated to the Ebro\r\nwithout stopping, or he might have offered battle at the first chance;\r\nbut the avoidance of such errors does not in itself constitute a very\r\nhigh claim to praise. An examination of the details of the march of\r\nthe British army during this ten days plainly fails to corroborate\r\nNapier’s statement that the French general ‘offered battle every day’\r\nand ‘baffled his great adversary.’ His halt for a few hours at Celada\r\non September 16th was the only one during which he allowed the allied\r\nmain body to get into touch with him late in the day; and he absconded\r\nbefore Wellington’s first manœuvre to outflank him[25].\r\n\r\nThe thing that is truly astonishing in this ten days is the\r\nextraordinary torpidity of Wellington’s pursuit. He started by waiting\r\nthree days at Valladolid after expelling the French; and he continued,\r\nwhen once he had put his head-quarters in motion, by making a series\r\nof easy marches of six to ten miles a day, never showing the least\r\nwish to hustle his adversary or to bring him to action[26]. Now to\r\nmanœuvre the French army to beyond Burgos, or even to the Ebro, was\r\nnot the desired end--it was necessary to put Clausel out of action,\r\nif (as Wellington kept repeating in all his letters) the main allied\r\narmy was to return to Madrid within a few weeks, to watch for Soult’s\r\noffensive. To escort the Army of Portugal with ceremonious politeness\r\nto Briviesca, without the loss to pursuers or pursued of fifty men, was\r\nclearly not sufficient. Clausel’s troops, being not harassed in the\r\nleast, but allowed a comfortable retreat, remained an ‘army in being’:\r\nthough moved back eighty miles on the map, they were not disposed of,\r\nand could obviously come forward again the moment that Wellington\r\nleft the north with the main body of his troops. Nothing, therefore,\r\nwas gained by the whole manœuvre, save that Clausel was six marches\r\nfarther from the Douro than he had been on September 1st. To keep him\r\nin his new position Wellington must have left an adequate containing\r\narmy: it does not seem that he could have provided one from the 28,000\r\nAnglo-Portuguese and 11,000 Galicians who were at his disposition, and\r\nyet have had any appreciable force to take back to Madrid. Clausel had\r\nconducted his raid on Valladolid with something under 25,000 men; but\r\nthis did not represent the whole strength of the Army of Portugal:\r\nafter deducting the sick and the garrisons there were some 39,000 men\r\nleft--of these some were disarmed stragglers who had only just come\r\nback to their colours, others belonged to shattered corps which were\r\nonly just reorganizing themselves in their new _cadres_. But in a few\r\nweeks Clausel would have at least 35,000 men under arms of his own\r\ntroops, without counting anything that the Army of the North might\r\npossibly lend him. To contain him Wellington would have to leave, in\r\naddition to the 11,000 Galicians, at least three British divisions and\r\nthe corresponding cavalry--say 16,000 or 18,000 men. He could only\r\nbring back some 10,000 bayonets to join Hill near Madrid. This would\r\nnot enable him to face Soult.\r\n\r\nBut if Clausel had been dealt with in a more drastic style, if he had\r\nbeen hunted and harassed, it is clear that he might have been disabled\r\nfor a long time from taking the offensive. His army was still in a\r\ndoubtful condition as regards morale, and there can be little reason\r\nto doubt, that if hard pressed, it would have sunk again into the\r\ndespondency and disorder which had prevailed at the beginning of the\r\nmonth of August. The process of driving him back with a firm hand\r\nmight, no doubt, have been more costly than the slow tactics actually\r\nadopted; but undoubtedly such a policy would have paid in the end.\r\n\r\nThere is no explanation to be got out of Wellington’s rather numerous\r\nletters written between the 10th and the 21st. In one of them he\r\nactually observes that ‘we have been pushing them, but not very\r\nvigorously, till the 16th[27],’ without saying why the pressure was not\r\napplied more vigorously. From others it might perhaps be deduced that\r\nWellington was awaiting the arrival of the Galician army, because when\r\nit came up he would have a very large instead of a small superiority\r\nof force over the French. But this does not fully explain his slowness\r\nin pursuing an enemy who was evidently on the run, and determined not\r\nto fight. We may, as has been already mentioned, speak of his wish to\r\navoid loss of life (not much practised during the Burgos operations a\r\nfew days later on!) and of the difficulty of providing for supplies in\r\na countryside unvisited before by the British army, and very distant\r\nfrom its base-magazines. But when all has been said, no adequate\r\nexplanation for his policy has been provided. It remains inexplicable,\r\nand its results were unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF BURGOS. SEPTEMBER 19TH-OCTOBER 20TH, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Burgos lies on an isolated hill which rises straight out\r\nof the streets of the north-western corner of that ancient city, and\r\novertops them by 200 feet or rather more. Ere ever there were kings in\r\nCastile, it had been the residence of Fernan Gonzalez, and the early\r\ncounts who recovered the land from the Moors. Rebuilt a dozen times in\r\nthe Middle Ages, and long a favourite palace of the Castilian kings,\r\nit had been ruined by a great fire in 1736, and since then had not\r\nbeen inhabited. There only remained an empty shell, of which the most\r\nimportant part was the great Donjon which had defied the flames. The\r\nsummit of the hill is only 250 yards long: the eastern section of it\r\nwas occupied by the Donjon, the western by a large church, Santa Maria\r\nla Blanca: between them were more or less ruined buildings, which had\r\nsuffered from the conflagration. Passing by Burgos in 1808, after the\r\nbattle of Gamonal, Napoleon had noted the commanding situation of the\r\nhill, and had determined to make it one of the fortified bases upon\r\nwhich the French domination in northern Spain was to be founded. He had\r\ncaused a plan to be drawn up for the conversion of the ruined mediaeval\r\nstronghold into a modern citadel, which should overawe the city below,\r\nand serve as a half-way house, an arsenal, and a dépôt for French\r\ntroops moving between Bayonne and Madrid. Considered as a fortress it\r\nhad one prominent defect: while its eastern, southern, and western\r\nsides look down into the low ground around the Arlanzon river, there\r\nlies on its northern side, only 300 yards away, a flat-topped plateau,\r\ncalled the hill of San Miguel, which rises to within a few feet of the\r\nsame height as the Donjon, and overlooks all the lower slopes of the\r\nCastle mount. As this rising ground--now occupied by the city reservoir\r\nof Burgos--commanded so much of the defences, Napoleon held that it\r\nmust be occupied, and a fort upon it formed part of his original plan.\r\nBut the Emperor passed on; the tide of war swept far south of Madrid;\r\nand the full scheme for the fortification of Burgos was never carried\r\nout; money--the essential thing when building is in hand--was never\r\nforthcoming in sufficient quantities, and the actual state of the place\r\nin 1812 was very different from what it would have been if Napoleon’s\r\norders had been carried out in detail. Enough was done to make the\r\nCastle impregnable against guerrillero bands--the only enemies who ever\r\ncame near it between 1809 and 1812--but it could not be described as\r\na complete or satisfactory piece of military engineering. Against a\r\nbesieger unprovided with sufficient artillery it was formidable enough:\r\nround two-thirds of its circuit it had a complete double _enceinte_,\r\nenclosing the Donjon and the church on the summit which formed its\r\nnucleus. On the western side, for about one-third of its circumference,\r\nit had an outer or third line of defence, to take in the lowest slopes\r\nof the hill on which it lies. For here the ground descended gradually,\r\nwhile to the east it shelved very steeply down to the town, and an\r\nexternal defence was unnecessary and indeed impossible.\r\n\r\nThe outer line all round (i.e. the third line on the west, the second\r\nline on the rest of the circumference) had as its base the old walls\r\nof the external enclosure of the mediaeval Castle, modernized by\r\nshot-proof parapets and with tambours and palisades added at the angles\r\nto give flank fire. It had a ditch 30 feet wide, and a counterscarp\r\nin masonry, while the inner enceintes were only strong earthworks,\r\nlike good field entrenchments; they were, however, both furnished with\r\npalisades in front and were also ‘fraised’ above. The Donjon, which had\r\nbeen strengthened and built up, contained the powder magazine in its\r\nlower story. On its platform, which was most solid, was established\r\na battery for eight heavy guns (_Batterie Napoléon_), which from its\r\nlofty position commanded all the surrounding ground, including the\r\ntop of the hill of San Miguel. The magazine of provisions, which was\r\ncopiously supplied, was in the church of Santa Maria la Blanca. Food\r\nnever failed--but water was a more serious problem; there was only one\r\nwell, and the garrison had to be put on an allowance for drinking\r\nfrom the commencement of the siege. The hornwork of San Miguel, which\r\ncovered the important plateau to the north, had never been properly\r\nfinished. It was very large; its front was composed of earthwork 25\r\nfeet high, covered by a counterscarp of 10 feet deep. Here the work\r\nwas formidable, the scarp being steep and slippery; but the flanks\r\nwere not so strong, and the rear or gorge was only closed by a row of\r\npalisades, erected within the last two days. The only outer defences\r\nconsisted of three light _flèches_, or redans, lying some 60 yards out\r\nin front of the hornwork, at projecting points of the plateau, which\r\ncommanded the lower slopes. The artillery in San Miguel consisted of\r\nseven field-pieces, 4- and 6-pounders: there were no heavy guns in it.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Burgos belonged to the Army of the North, not to that\r\nof Portugal. Caffarelli himself paid a hasty visit to the place just\r\nbefore the siege began, and threw in some picked troops--two battalions\r\nof the 34th[28], one of the 130th; making 1,600 infantry. There were\r\nalso a company of artillery, another of pioneers, and detachments\r\nwhich brought up the whole to exactly 2,000 men--a very sufficient\r\nnumber for a place of such small size. There were nine heavy guns (16-\r\nand 12-pounders), of which eight were placed in the Napoleon battery,\r\neleven field-pieces (seven of them in San Miguel), and six mortars or\r\nhowitzers. This was none too great a provision, and would have been\r\ninadequate against a besieger provided with a proper battering-train:\r\nWellington--as we shall see--was not so provided. The governor was a\r\nGeneral of Brigade named Dubreton, one of the most resourceful and\r\nenterprising officers whom the British army ever encountered. He earned\r\nat Burgos a reputation even more brilliant than that which Phillipon\r\nacquired at Badajoz.\r\n\r\nThe weak points of the fortress were firstly the unfinished condition\r\nof the San Miguel hornwork, which Dubreton had to maintain as long as\r\nhe could, in order that the British might not use the hill on which it\r\nstood as vantage ground for battering the Castle; secondly, the lack\r\nof cover within the works. The Donjon and the church of Santa Maria\r\ncould not house a tithe of the garrison; the rest had to bivouac in\r\nthe open, a trying experience in the rain, which fell copiously on\r\nmany days of the siege. If the besiegers had possessed a provision\r\nof mortars, to keep up a regular bombardment of the interior of the\r\nCastle, it would not long have been tenable, owing to the losses that\r\nmust have been suffered. Thirdly must be mentioned the bad construction\r\nof many of the works--part of them were mediaeval structures, not\r\noriginally intended to resist cannon, and hastily adapted to modern\r\nnecessities: some of them were not furnished with parapets or\r\nembrasures--which had to be extemporized with sandbags. Lastly, it must\r\nbe remembered that the conical shape of the hill exposed the inner no\r\nless than the outer works to battering: the lower _enceintes_ only\r\npartly covered the inner ones, whose higher sections stood up visible\r\nabove them. The Donjon and Santa Maria were exposed from the first to\r\nsuch fire as the enemy could turn against them, no less than the walls\r\nof the outer circumference. If Wellington had owned the siege-train\r\nthat he brought against Badajoz, the place must have succumbed in ten\r\ndays. But the commander was able and determined, the troops willing,\r\nthe supply of food and of artillery munitions ample--Burgos had\r\nalways been an important dépôt. Dubreton’s orders were to keep his\r\nenemy detained as long as possible--and he succeeded, even beyond all\r\nreasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nWellington had always been aware that Burgos was fortified, but during\r\nhis advance he had spoken freely of his intention to capture it. On\r\nSeptember 3rd he had written, ‘I have some heavy guns with me, and\r\nhave an idea of forcing the siege of Burgos--but that still depends\r\non circumstances[29].’ Four days later he wrote at Valladolid, ‘I am\r\npreparing to drive away the detachments of the Army of Portugal from\r\nthe Douro, and I propose, if I have time, to take Burgos[30].’ Yet\r\nat the same moment he kept impressing on his correspondents that his\r\nmarch to the North was a temporary expedient, a mere _parergon_; his\r\nreal business would be with Soult, and he must soon be back at Madrid\r\nwith his main body. It is this that makes so inexplicable his lingering\r\nfor a month before Dubreton’s castle, when he had once discovered\r\nthat it would not fall, as he had hoped, in a few days. After his\r\nfirst failure before the place, he acknowledged it might possibly foil\r\nhim altogether. Almost at the start he ventured the opinion that ‘As\r\nfar as I can judge, I am apprehensive that the means I have are not\r\nsufficient to enable me to take the Castle.’ Yet he thought it worth\r\nwhile to try irregular methods: ‘the enemy are ill-provided with water;\r\ntheir magazines of provisions are in a place exposed to be set on fire.\r\nI think it possible, therefore, that I have it in my power to force\r\nthem to surrender, although I may not be able to lay the place open to\r\nassault[31].’\r\n\r\nThe cardinal weakness of Wellington’s position was exactly the same\r\nas at the Salamanca forts, three months back. He had no sufficient\r\nbattering-train for a regular siege: after the Salamanca experience it\r\nis surprising that he allowed himself to be found for a second time\r\nin this deficiency. There were dozens of heavy guns in the arsenal at\r\nMadrid, dozens more (Marmont’s old siege-train) at Ciudad Rodrigo and\r\nAlmeida. But Madrid was 130 miles away, Rodrigo 180. With the army\r\nthere was only Alexander Dickson’s composite Anglo-Portuguese artillery\r\nreserve, commanded by Major Ariaga, and consisting of three iron\r\n18-pounders, and five 24-pounder howitzers, served by 150 gunners--90\r\nBritish, 60 Portuguese. The former were good battering-guns; the\r\nhowitzers, however, were not--they were merely short guns of position,\r\nvery useless for a siege, and very inaccurate in their fire. They threw\r\na heavy ball, but with weak power--the charge was only two pounds\r\nof powder: the shot when fired at a stout wall, from any distance,\r\nhad such weak impact that it regularly bounded off without making\r\nany impression on the masonry. The only real use of these guns was\r\nfor throwing case at short distances. ‘In estimating the efficient\r\nordnance used at the Spanish sieges,’ says the official historian of\r\nthe Burgos failure, ‘these howitzers ought in fairness to be excluded\r\nfrom calculation, as they did little more than waste invaluable\r\nammunition[32].’ This was as well known to Wellington as to his\r\nsubordinates, and it is inexplicable that he did not in place of them\r\nbring up from Madrid real battering-guns: with ten more 18-pounders\r\nhe would undoubtedly have taken the Castle of Burgos. But heavy guns\r\nrequire many draught cattle, and are hard to drag over bad roads: the\r\nabsolute minimum had been taken with the army, as in June. And it was\r\nimpossible to bring up more siege-guns in a hurry, as was done at the\r\nsiege of the Salamanca forts, for the nearest available pieces were\r\nnot a mere sixty miles away, as on the former occasion, but double and\r\ntriple that distance. Yet if, on the first day of doubt before Burgos,\r\nWellington had sent urgent orders for the dispatch of more 18-pounders\r\nfrom Madrid, they would have been up in time; though no doubt there\r\nwould have been terrible difficulties in providing for their transport.\r\nIt was only when it had grown too late that more artillery was at last\r\nrequisitioned--and had to be turned back not long after it had started.\r\n\r\nOther defects there were in the besieging army, especially the same\r\nwant of trained sappers and miners that had been seen at Badajoz,\r\nand of engineer officers[33]. Of this more hereafter:--the first\r\nand foremost difficulty, without which the rest would have been\r\ncomparatively unimportant, was the lack of heavy artillery.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed to the chronicle of the siege. On the evening on which\r\nthe army arrived before Burgos the 6th Division took post on the south\r\nbank of the Arlanzon: the 1st Division and Pack’s Portuguese brigade\r\nswept round the city and formed an investing line about the Castle.\r\nIt was drawn as close as possible, especially on the side of the\r\nhornwork of San Miguel, where the light companies of the first Division\r\npushed up the hill, taking shelter in dead ground where they could,\r\nand dislodged the French outposts from the three _flèches_ which lay\r\nupon its sky-line. Wellington, after consulting his chief engineer\r\nand artillery officers, determined that his first move must be to\r\ncapture the hornwork, in order to use its vantage-ground for battering\r\nthe Castle. The same night (September 19-20) an assault, without any\r\npreparation of artillery fire, was made upon it. The main body of the\r\nassailing force was composed of Pack’s Portuguese, who were assisted\r\nby the whole of the 1/42nd and by the flank-companies[34] of Stirling’s\r\nbrigade of the 1st Division, to which the Black Watch belonged. The\r\narrangement was that while a strong firing party (300 men) of the\r\n1/42nd were to advance to the neighbourhood of the horn work, ‘as near\r\nto the salient angle as possible,’ and to endeavour to keep down the\r\nfire of the garrison, two columns each composed of Portuguese, but with\r\nladder parties and forlorn hopes from the Highland battalion, should\r\ncharge at the two demi-bastions to right and left of the salient, and\r\nescalade them. Meanwhile the flank-companies of Stirling’s brigade\r\n(1/42nd, 1/24th, 1/79th) were to make a false attack upon the rear, or\r\ngorge, of the hornwork, which might be turned into a real one if it\r\nshould be found weakly held.\r\n\r\nThe storm succeeded, but with vast and unnecessary loss of life, and\r\nnot in the way which Wellington had intended. It was bright moonlight,\r\nand the firing party, when coming up over the crest, were at once\r\ndetected by the French, who opened a very heavy fire upon them. The\r\nHighlanders commenced to reply while still 150 yards away, and then\r\nadvanced firing till they came close up to the work, where they\r\nremained for a quarter of an hour, entirely exposed and suffering\r\nterribly. Having lost half their numbers they finally dispersed, but\r\nnot till after the main attack had failed. On both their flanks the\r\nassaulting columns were repulsed, though the advanced parties duly laid\r\ntheir ladders: they were found somewhat short, and after wavering for\r\nsome minutes Pack’s men retired, suffering heavily. The whole affair\r\nwould have been a failure, but for the assault on the gorge. Here the\r\nthree light companies--140 men--were led by Somers Cocks, formerly one\r\nof Wellington’s most distinguished intelligence officers, the hero of\r\nmany a risky ride, but recently promoted to a majority in the 1/79th.\r\nHe made no demonstration, but a fierce attack from the first. He ran\r\nup the back slope of the hill of St. Miguel, under a destructive fire\r\nfrom the Castle, which detected his little column at once, and shelled\r\nit from the rear all the time that it was at work. The frontal assault,\r\nhowever, was engrossing the attention of the garrison of the hornwork,\r\nand only a weak guard had been left at the gorge. The light companies\r\nbroke through the 7-foot palisades, partly by using axes, partly by\r\nmain force and climbing. Somers Cocks then divided his men into two\r\nbodies, leaving the smaller to block the postern in the gorge, while\r\nwith the larger he got upon the parapet and advanced firing towards the\r\nright demi-bastion. Suddenly attacked in the rear, just as they found\r\nthemselves victorious in front, the French garrison--a battalion of the\r\n34th, 500 strong--made no attempt to drive out the light companies,\r\nbut ran in a mass towards the postern, trampled down the guard left\r\nthere, and escaped to the Castle across the intervening ravine. They\r\nlost 198 men, including 60 prisoners, and left behind their seven\r\nfield-pieces[35]. The assailants suffered far more--they had 421 killed\r\nand wounded, of whom no less than 204 were in the 1/42nd, which had\r\nsuffered terribly in the main assault. The Portuguese lost 113 only,\r\nnever having pushed their attack home. This murderous business was the\r\nfirst serious fighting in which the Black Watch were involved since\r\ntheir return to Spain in April 1812; at Salamanca they had been little\r\nengaged, and were the strongest British battalion in the field--over\r\n1,000 bayonets. Wellington attributed their heavy casualties to their\r\ninexperience--they exposed themselves over-much. ‘If I had had some of\r\nthe troops who have stormed so often before [3rd and Light Divisions],\r\nI should not have lost a fourth of the number[36].’\r\n\r\nThe moment that the hornwork had fallen into the power of the British,\r\nthe heavy guns of the Napoleon battery opened such an appalling fire\r\nupon it, that the troops had to be withdrawn, save 300 men, who with\r\nsome difficulty formed a lodgement in its interior, and a communication\r\nfrom its left front to the ‘dead ground’ on the north-west side of the\r\nhill, by which reliefs could enter under cover.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the next day (September 20) the garrison kept up such a\r\nsearching fire upon the work that little could be done there, but on\r\nthe following night the first battery of the besiegers [battery 1 on\r\nthe map] was begun on a spot on the south-western side of the hill,\r\na little way from the rear face of the hornwork, which was sheltered\r\nby an inequality of the ground from the guns of the Napoleon battery.\r\nIt was armed on the night of the 23rd with two of the 18-pounders and\r\nthree of the howitzers of the siege-train, with which it was intended\r\nto batter the Castle in due time. They were not used however at\r\npresent, as Wellington, encouraged by his success at San Miguel, had\r\ndetermined to try as a preliminary move a second escalade, without help\r\nof artillery, on the outer _enceinte_ of the Castle. This was to prove\r\nthe first, and not the least disheartening, of the checks that he was\r\nto meet before Burgos.\r\n\r\nThe point of attack selected was on the north-western side of the\r\nlower wall, at a place where it was some 23 feet high. The choice was\r\ndetermined by the existence of a hollow road coming out of the suburb\r\nof San Pedro, from which access in perfectly dead ground, unsearched\r\nby any of the French guns, could be got, to a point within 60 yards\r\nof the ditch. The assault was to be made by 400 volunteers from the\r\nthree brigades of the 1st Division, and was to be supported and flanked\r\nby a separate attack on another point on the south side of the outer\r\n_enceinte_, to be delivered by a detachment of the caçadores of the\r\n6th Division. The force used was certainly too small for the purpose\r\nrequired, and it did not even get a chance of success. The Portuguese,\r\nwhen issuing from the ruined houses of the town, were detected at once,\r\nand being heavily fired on, retired without even approaching their\r\ngoal. At the main attack the ladder party and forlorn hope reached the\r\nditch in their first rush, sprang in and planted four ladders against\r\nthe wall. The enemy had been taken somewhat by surprise, but recovered\r\nhimself before the supports got to the front, which they did in a\r\nstraggling fashion. A heavy musketry fire was opened on the men in the\r\nditch, and live shells were rolled by hand upon them. Several attempts\r\nwere made to mount the ladders, but all who neared their top rungs\r\nwere shot or bayoneted, and after the officer in charge of the assault\r\n(Major Laurie, 1/79th) had been killed, the stormers ran back to their\r\ncover in the hollow road. They had lost 158 officers and men in all--76\r\nfrom the Guards’ brigade, 44 from the German brigade, 9 from the Line\r\nbrigade of the 1st Division, while the ineffective Portuguese diversion\r\nhad cost only 29 casualties. The French had 9 killed and 13 wounded.\r\n\r\nThis was a deplorable business from every point of view. An escalade\r\ndirected against an intact line of defence, held by a strong garrison,\r\nwhose morale had not been shaken by any previous artillery preparation,\r\nwas unjustifiable. There was not, as at Almaraz, any element of\r\nsurprise involved; nor, as at the taking of the Castle of Badajoz, were\r\na great number of stormers employed. Four hundred men with five ladders\r\ncould not hope to force a well-built wall and ditch, defended by an\r\nenemy as numerous as themselves. The men murmured that they had been\r\nsent on an impossible task; and the heavy loss, added to that on San\r\nMiguel three days before, was discouraging. Many angry comments were\r\nmade on the behaviour of the Portuguese on both occasions[37].\r\n\r\nIrregular methods having failed, it remained to see what could be\r\ndone by more formal procedure, by battering and sapping up towards\r\nthe enemy’s defences on the west side of the Castle, the only one\r\naccessible for approach by parallels and trenches. The plan adopted was\r\nto work up from the hollow road (from which the stormers had started on\r\nthe last escalade) in front of the suburb of San Pedro. The hollow road\r\nwas utilized as a first parallel; from it a flying sap (_b_ on the map)\r\nwas pushed out uphill towards the outer _enceinte_ in a diagonal line.\r\nThe object was to arrive at it and to mine it (at the place marked I\r\non the map). When the working party had got well forward, a point was\r\nchosen in the sap at a distance of 60 feet from the wall, and the mine\r\nwas started from thence. All this was done under very heavy fire from\r\nthe Castle, but it was partly kept down by placing marksmen all along\r\nthe parallel, who picked off many of the French gunners, and of the\r\ninfantry who lined the parapet of the outer _enceinte_. Sometimes the\r\nreturn fire of the place was nearly silenced, but many of the British\r\nmarksmen fell. The work in the flying sap was made very costly by\r\nthe fact that the trench, being on very steep ground, had to be made\r\nabnormally deep [September 23-6].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the hill of San Miguel, a second battery (No. 2 on the\r\nmap) was dug out behind the gorge of the dismantled hornwork, and\r\ntrenches for musketry (_a.a_ on the map) were constructed on the slope\r\nof the hill, so as to bring fire to bear on the flank and rear of the\r\nlower defences of the Castle. The French heavy guns of the Napoleon\r\nbattery devoted themselves to incommoding this work; their fire was\r\naccurate, many casualties took place, and occasionally all advance\r\nhad to cease. A deep trench of communication between the batteries on\r\nSan Miguel and the attack in front of San Pedro was also started, in\r\norder to link up the two approaches by a short line: the ground was all\r\ncommanded by the Castle, and the digging went slowly because of the\r\nintense fire directed on it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile battery No. 1 on San Miguel at last came into operation,\r\nfiring with five howitzers (the 18-pounders originally placed there had\r\nbeen withdrawn) against the palisades and flank of the north-western\r\nangle of the outer _enceinte_ of the Castle. These inefficient guns\r\nhad no good effect; it was found that they shot so inaccurately and so\r\nweakly that little harm was done. After firing 141 rounds they stopped,\r\nit being evident that the damage done was wholly incommensurate with\r\nthe powder and shot expended [September 25]. This first interference\r\nof the British artillery in the contest was not very cheering either\r\nto the troops, or to the engineers engaged in planning the attack on\r\nthe Castle. The guns in battery 1 kept silence for the next five days,\r\nwhile battery 2, where the 18-pounders had now been placed, had never\r\nyet fired a single shot. Wellington was now staking his luck on the\r\nmine, which was being run forward from the head of the flying sap.\r\n\r\nThis work, having to be cut very deep, as it was to go right under\r\nthe ditch, and being in the hands of untrained volunteers from the\r\ninfantry, who had no proper cutting tools, advanced very slowly. The\r\nsoil, fortunately, was favourable, being a stiff argillaceous clay\r\nwhich showed no disposition to crumble up: the gallery was cut as if\r\nin stone, with even and perpendicular sides and floor, and no props\r\nor timbering were found necessary. The main hindrance to rapid work,\r\nover and above the unskilfulness of the miners, was the foul air which\r\naccumulated at the farther end of the excavation: many times it was\r\nnecessary to withdraw the men for some hours to allow it to clear away.\r\nAt noon on September 29 the miners declared that they had reached the\r\nfoundations of the wall, and this seemed correct enough, for they had\r\ncome to a course of large rough blocks of stone, extending laterally\r\nfor as far as could be probed. It is probable, however, that the\r\nmasonry was really the remains of some old advanced turret or outwork,\r\nprojecting in front of the modern _enceinte_. For when the end of the\r\nmine was packed with twelve barrels, containing 90 lb. of powder each,\r\nwell tamped, and fired at midnight, the explosion brought down many\r\nstones from the front of the wall, but did not affect the earth of the\r\nrampart, which remained standing perpendicular behind it. There seemed,\r\nhowever, to be places, at the points where the broken facing joined\r\nthe intact part of the wall, where men might scramble up. Accordingly\r\nthe storming-column of 300 volunteers who had been waiting for the\r\nexplosion, was let loose, under cover of a strong musketry fire from\r\nthe trenches. A sergeant and four men went straight for one of the\r\naccessible points, mounted, and were cast down again, three of them\r\nwounded. But the main body of the forlorn hope and its officer went\r\na little farther along the wall, reached a section that was wholly\r\nimpracticable for climbing, and ran back to the trenches to report that\r\nthe defences were uninjured. The supports followed their example. The\r\nloss, therefore, was small--only 29 killed and wounded--but the moral\r\neffect of the repulse was very bad. The men, for the most part, made\r\nup their minds that they had been sent to a hopeless and impossible\r\ntask by the errors of an incompetent staff. The engineers declared that\r\nthe stormers had not done their best, or made any serious attempt to\r\napproach the wall.\r\n\r\nWellington must by now have been growing much disquieted about the\r\nevent of the siege. He had spent ten days before Burgos, but since\r\nthe capture of the hornwork on the first night had accomplished\r\nabsolutely nothing. There were rumours that the Army of Portugal\r\nwas being heavily reinforced, and these were perfectly true. By the\r\ncoming up from the rear of drafts, convalescents, and stragglers,\r\nit had received some 7,000 men of reinforcements, and by October 1\r\nhad 38,000 men with the colours--more than Wellington counted, even\r\nincluding the Galicians. Souham was now in command: he had been on\r\nleave in France at the time of the battle of Salamanca, but returned\r\nin the last days of September and superseded Clausel. There had been\r\nin August some intention of sending Masséna back to the Peninsula, to\r\nreplace the disabled Marmont. Clarke, the Minister of War, dispatched\r\nhim to Bayonne on his own responsibility, there being no time to\r\nconsult Napoleon, who was now nearing Moscow[38]. When the Emperor\r\nhad the question put to him he nominated Reille[39], but by the time\r\nthat his order got to Spain Souham was in full charge of the army, and\r\nwas not displaced till the campaign was over. Masséna never crossed\r\nthe frontier to relieve him, reporting himself indisposed, and unable\r\nto face the toils of a campaign: his nomination by Clarke was never\r\nconfirmed, and he presently returned to Paris. Hearing of the gathering\r\nstrength of the Army of Portugal, Wellington remarked that he was\r\nlucky--the French were giving him more time than he had any right to\r\nexpect[40] to deal with Burgos. Meanwhile he showed no intention, as\r\nyet, either of abandoning the siege or of taking back to Madrid the\r\nmain part of his army, as he had repeatedly promised to do in his\r\nletters of early September. Soult and the King were not yet showing in\r\nany dangerous combination on the Valencian side, and till they moved\r\nWellington made up his mind to persevere in his unlucky siege. It is\r\nclear that he hated to admit a failure, so long as any chance remained,\r\nand that he was set on showing that he could ‘make bricks without\r\nstraw.’\r\n\r\nThe mine explosion of the 29th-30th had been a disheartening affair;\r\nbut Wellington had now resolved to repeat this form of attack, aiding\r\nit however this time by the fire of his insignificant siege-train.\r\nA second mine had already been begun, against a point of the outer\r\n_enceinte_ (II in the map) somewhat to the south of that originally\r\nattacked by the first. This was pushed with energy between September 30\r\nand October 4; but at the same time an endeavour was made to utilize,\r\nfor what it was worth, the direct fire of artillery, at the shortest\r\npossible distance from the walls. On the night of September 30-October\r\n1 a battery for three guns (No. 3 in the map) was commenced, slightly\r\nin advance of the 1st Parallel in the Hollow Road, no more than some\r\nsixty-five yards from the French defences. The garrison, not having\r\nbeen troubled with any battery-building on this front before, suspected\r\nnothing, and at dawn on October 1 the earthwork was completed, and\r\nthe carpenters were beginning to lay the wooden platforms on which\r\nthe 18-pounders were to stand. With the coming of the light the enemy\r\ndiscovered the new and threatening work, and began to concentrate upon\r\nit every gun that he could bring to bear. The platforms however were\r\ncompleted, and at 9 o’clock the artillery hauled the three heavy guns,\r\nwhich were Wellington’s sole effective battering-tools, into their\r\nplaces. The sight of them provoked the French to redoubled activity:\r\nshot shell and musketry fire were directed upon the front of the\r\nbattery from many quarters, its parapet began to fly to pieces, and\r\nthe loss among the artillerymen was heavy. Before the embrasures had\r\nbeen opened, or a single shot had been fired from the three guns, the\r\nenemy’s fire had become so rapid and accurate that the work had become\r\nruined and untenable. Two of the 18-pounders had been cast down from\r\ntheir carriages and put out of action--one had a trunnion knocked off,\r\nthe other (which had been hit eleven times) was split in the muzzle.\r\nOnly one of the three remained in working order. Without having fired\r\neven once, two of the three big guns were disabled! It was a bad look\r\nout for the future [October 1].\r\n\r\nWellington, however, ordered a second battery to be constructed,\r\nsomewhat to the left rear of the first (No. 4 in the map), and behind\r\ninstead of before the parallel. The position chosen was one on to which\r\nmany of the French guns could not be trained, while it was equally\r\ngood with battery No. 3 for playing on the outer _enceinte_. After\r\nmidnight [October 1-2] the two disabled and one intact 18-pounders\r\nwere dragged out of the abandoned battery and taken to the rear. Next\r\nmorning, however, a new disappointment was in store for Wellington: the\r\nFrench detected battery No. 4, and opened upon it, with all guns that\r\ncould reach it, such an accurate and effective fire that the parapet,\r\nthough revetted with wool-packs, soon began to crumble, and the workmen\r\nhad to withdraw. ‘It became evident that under such a plunging fire\r\nno guns could ever be served there[41].’ All hopes of breaching the\r\nlower _enceinte_ from any point on its immediate front had to be\r\nabandoned--and meanwhile the heavy artillery had been ruined.\r\n\r\nThe next order issued was that the solitary intact 18-pounder and\r\nthe other gun with the split lip--which had been mounted on a new\r\ncarriage--should be hauled back to the hill of San Miguel and put into\r\ntheir original place, battery No. 1. The night during which they were\r\nto be removed was one of torrential rain, and the working parties\r\ncharged with the duty gradually dropped aside and sought shelter,\r\nwith the exception of those detailed from the Guards’ brigade and\r\nthe artillery. At dawn on October 3 the guns had not reached their\r\ndestination, and had to be shunted beside the salient of the hornwork,\r\nto hide them from the enemy during the day. Wellington, justly vexed\r\nwith the shirking, ordered the defaulters to be put on for extra duty,\r\nand the names of their officers to be formally noted. This day was\r\nlost for all work except that of the mine, which advanced steadily but\r\nslowly, long intervals of rest having to be given in order to allow for\r\nthe evaporation of foul air in its inner depths (October 3). On the\r\nfollowing night, however, the 18-pounders were got into battery No. 1,\r\nand about the same time the engineer officers reported that the mine\r\n(now eighty-three feet long) had got well under the wall of the outer\r\n_enceinte_. The 4th of October was therefore destined to be an eventful\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAt dawn, battery No. 1 opened on the wall, where it had been damaged\r\nby the first mine on September 29th, using the two 18-pounders and\r\nthree howitzers. The effect was much better than could have been\r\nexpected: the 18 lb. round-shot (of which about 350 were used) had\r\ngood penetrating power, and the already shaken wall crumbled rapidly,\r\nso that by four in the afternoon there was a practicable breach sixty\r\nfeet long.\r\n\r\nWellington at once arranged for a third assault on the outer\r\n_enceinte_, telling off for it not details from many regiments, as on\r\nthe previous occasion, but--what was much better--a single compact\r\nbattalion, the 2/24th. Only the supports were mixed parties. At 5 p.m.\r\nthe mine was fired, with excellent effect, throwing down nearly 100\r\nfeet of the rampart, and killing many of the French. Before the dust\r\nhad cleared away, the men of the 2/24th dashed forward toward both\r\nbreaches, with great spirit, and carried them with ease, and with\r\nno excessive loss, driving the French within the second or middle\r\n_enceinte_. The total loss that day was 224, of which the assault cost\r\nabout 190, the other casualties being in the batteries on San Miguel\r\nand in the trenches. But the curious point of the figures is that\r\nthe 2/24th, forming the actual storming-column, lost only 68 killed\r\nand wounded; the supports, and the workmen who were employed to form\r\na lodgement within the conquered space, suffered far more heavily.\r\nDubreton reports the casualties of the garrison at 27 killed and 42\r\nwounded [October 4].\r\n\r\nIn the night after the storm the British, after entrenching the two\r\nbreaches, began to make preparations to sap forward to the second\r\n_enceinte_, which being ditchless and not faced with masonry, looked\r\nless formidable than that which had already been carried, though it was\r\nprotected by a solid row of palisades. Meanwhile the artillery officers\r\nproposed that battery No. 2 on San Miguel should be turned against a\r\nnew objective, the point where the walls of the second and the inner\r\nlines met, immediately in front of the hornwork, in the re-entering\r\nangle marked III in the map. Battery No. 1 was meanwhile to play on the\r\npalisades of the second _enceinte_. This it did with some success. At\r\n5 o’clock in the evening, however, there was an unexpected tumult in\r\nthe newly-gained ground. Dubreton, misliking the look of the approaches\r\nwhich the assailants were beginning to run out from the breaches,\r\nordered a sortie of 300 men, who dashed out most unexpectedly against\r\nthe lodgements in front of the northern breach (No. I), and drove away\r\nthe workmen with heavy loss, seizing most of their tools, overthrowing\r\nthe gabions, and shovelling earth into the trench. They gave way when\r\nthe covering party came up, and retired, having done immense mischief\r\nand disabled 142 of the besiegers, while their own loss was only 17\r\nkilled and 21 wounded. This was an unpleasant surprise, as showing the\r\nhigh spirit and resolution of the garrison; but the damage was not so\r\ngreat but that one good night’s work sufficed to repair it: the loss\r\nof tools was the most serious matter--the French had carried off 200\r\npicks and shovels which could not be replaced, the stock (as usual in\r\nPeninsular sieges) being very low[42].\r\n\r\nOn the 6th and 7th the besiegers again began to sap forward towards the\r\nsecond _enceinte_, with the object of establishing a second parallel on\r\nits glacis, but with no great success. There was little or no effective\r\nfire from the batteries on San Miguel to keep down the artillery of the\r\nbesieged, and the work at the sap-head was so deadly that the engineers\r\ncould hardly expect the men to do much: however, the trench was driven\r\nforward to within thirty yards of the palisades. So useless were the\r\nhowitzers in No. 2 battery that two of them were removed, and replaced\r\nby two French field-pieces from those captured in the hornwork on\r\nSeptember 20; these, despite of their small calibre, worked decidedly\r\nbetter. The heavy guns in the Napoleon Battery devoted themselves to\r\nkeeping down the fire of the two surviving 18-pounders in battery No.\r\n2, and on the 7th knocked one from its carriage and broke off one of\r\nits trunnions. This left only one heavy piece in working order! But\r\nthe artisans of the artillery park, doing their best, rigged up both\r\nthe gun injured on this day and that disabled on October 1 upon block\r\ncarriages, with a sort of cradle arrangement to hold them up on the\r\nside where a trunnion was gone; and it was found that they could be\r\nfired, if a very reduced charge was used. When anything like the full\r\namount of powder was employed, they jumped off their carriages, as was\r\nnatural, considering that they were only properly attached to them on\r\none side. Of course, their battering power was hopelessly reduced by\r\nthe small charge. The artillery diarists of the siege call them ‘the\r\ntwo _lame_ guns’ during the last fortnight of their employment.\r\n\r\nOn October 8 Dubreton, growing once more anxious at the sight of the\r\nadvance of the trenches toward the second _enceinte_, ordered another\r\nsally, which was executed by 400 men three hours after midnight. It\r\nwas almost as successful as that of October 5. The working party of\r\nPack’s Portuguese and the covering party from the K.G.L. brigade of the\r\n1st Division were taken quite unawares, and driven out of the advanced\r\nworks with very heavy loss. The trench was completely levelled, and\r\nmany tools carried away, before the supports in reserve, under Somers\r\nCocks of the 1/79th--the hero of the assault on the Hornwork--came\r\nup and drove the French back to their palisades. Cocks himself was\r\nkilled--he was an officer of the highest promise who would have gone\r\nfar if fate had spared him, and was the centre of a large circle of\r\nfriends who have left enthusiastic appreciations of his greatness of\r\nspirit and ready wit[43]. The besiegers lost 184 men in this unhappy\r\nbusiness, of whom 133 belonged to the German Legion: 18 of them were\r\nprisoners carried off into the Castle[44]. The French casualties were\r\nno more than 11 killed and 22 wounded--only a sixth part of those of\r\nthe Allies.\r\n\r\nWe have now (October 8) arrived at the most depressing part of the\r\nchronicle of a siege which had been from the first a series of\r\ndisappointments. After the storm of the lower _enceinte_ on October 4,\r\nthe British made no further progress. The main cause of failure was\r\nundoubtedly the weakness of their artillery, which repeatedly opened\r\nagain from one or other of the two San Miguel batteries, only to be\r\nsilenced after an hour or two of conflict with the heavy guns on the\r\nDonjon. But it was not only the small number of the 18-pounders which\r\nwas fatal to success--they had run out of powder and shot; a great\r\ndeal of the firing was done with second-hand missiles--French 16 lb.\r\nshot picked out of the works into which they had fallen. The infantry\r\nwere offered a bonus for each one brought to the artillery park, and\r\n426 were paid for. More than 2,000 French 8 lb. and 4 lb. shot were\r\nalso bought from the men, though these were less useful, being only\r\navailable for field-guns, which were of little use for battering. But\r\nin order not to discourage the hunting propensities of the soldiers,\r\neverything brought in was duly purchased. Shot of sorts never wholly\r\nfailed, but lack of powder was a far more serious problem--it cannot\r\nbe picked up second-hand. There would have been an absolute deficiency\r\nbut for a stock got from a most unexpected quarter. Sir Home Popham and\r\nhis ships were still on the Cantabrian coast, assisting the operations\r\nof Longa and Mendizabal against the Army of the North. The squadron\r\nhad made its head-quarters at Santander, the chief port recovered from\r\nthe French, and communications with it had been opened up through\r\nthe mountains by the way of Reynosa. On September 26 Wellington had\r\nwritten to Popham[45] to inquire whether powder could not be brought\r\nfrom Santander to Burgos, by means of mule trains to be hired at the\r\nport. The Commodore, always helpful, fell in with the idea at once,\r\nand succeeded in procuring the mules. On October 5th 40 barrels of\r\n90 lb. weight each were brought into camp: considering the distance,\r\nthe badness of the roads, and the disturbed state of the country, it\r\ncannot be denied that Popham did very well in delivering it only ten\r\ndays after Wellington had written his request, and eight days after he\r\nhad received it. Other convoys from Santander came later. It is a pity\r\nthat Wellington did not think of asking for heavy ship guns at the same\r\ntime. But he had written to the Commodore on October 2 that ‘the means\r\nof transport required to move a train either from the coast or from\r\nMadrid (where we have plenty) are so extensive that the attempt would\r\nbe impracticable[46].’\r\n\r\nThe idea of requisitioning ship guns had been started on the very first\r\nday of the siege (September 20) by Sir Howard Douglas, who had lately\r\ncome from Popham’s side, and maintained that by the use of draught\r\noxen, supplemented by man-handling in difficult places, the thing could\r\nbe done. But Wellington would hear nothing of it, maintaining that\r\nmatters would be settled one way or another before the guns could\r\npossibly arrive. After the disaster to batteries 3 and 4 on October 2nd\r\nhe--too late--altered his opinion, and consented that an appeal should\r\nbe made to Popham. The Commodore rose to the occasion, and started off\r\ntwo 24-pounders on October 9th, which by immense exertions were dragged\r\nas far as Reynosa, only 50 miles from Burgos, by October 18th, and had\r\npassed the worst part of the road. But at Reynosa they were turned\r\nback, for Wellington was just raising the siege and preparing to retire\r\non Valladolid. It is clear that if they had been asked for on September\r\n20 instead of October 3rd--as Howard Douglas had suggested--they and\r\nno doubt another heavy gun or so, could have been brought forward\r\nin time for the last bombardment, and might have turned it into a\r\nsuccess. But guns might also have come from Madrid: Wellington did not\r\nthink it wholly impossible to move artillery from the Retiro arsenal.\r\nFor, ere he left it on August 31, he had instructed Carlos de España\r\nthat the best guns there should be evacuated on to Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nif ever Soult and King Joseph should draw too close in[47]. It is\r\ntrue that he observed that the transport would be a difficult matter,\r\nand that much would have to be destroyed, and not carried off. But\r\nit is clear that he thought that _some_ cannon could be moved. The\r\nstrangest part of the story is that his own brother-in-law, Pakenham,\r\nwrote to him from Madrid offering to send him twelve heavy guns over\r\nthe Somosierra, pledging himself to manage the transport by means\r\nof oxen got in the Madrid district. His offer was rejected[48]. It\r\nseems that the conviction that the Castle of Burgos would be a hard\r\nnut to crack came too late to Wellington. And when he did realize its\r\nstrength, he did not reconsider the matter of siege artillery at once,\r\nbut proceeded to try the methods of Badajoz and Almaraz, mere _force\r\nmajeure_ applied by escalade, instead of thinking of bringing up more\r\nguns. He judged--wrongly as it chanced--that he would either take\r\nthe place by sheer assault, or else that the French field army would\r\ninterfere before October was far advanced. Neither hypothesis turned\r\nout correct, and so he had the opportunity of a full month’s siege, and\r\nfailed in it for want of means that might have been procured, if only\r\nhe had made another resolve on August 31st, or even on September 20.\r\nBut even the greatest generals cannot be infallible prophets concerning\r\nwhat they will require a month ahead. The mistake is explicable,\r\nand the critic who censures it over-much would be presumptuous and\r\nunreasonable[49].\r\n\r\nBut to return to the chronicle of the unlucky days between October\r\n8th and October 21st. The working forward by sap from the third\r\n_enceinte_ towards the second practically stood still, after the second\r\ndestructive sally of the French against the new approaches. This is\r\nlargely accounted for by the steepness of the ground, which made it\r\nnecessary to dig trenches of extraordinary depth, and by the setting\r\nin after October 7 of very rainy weather, which made the trenches\r\nmuddy rivers, and the steep banks of earth and breaches so slippery\r\nthat it was with great difficulty that parties could find their way\r\nabout and move to their posts[50]. But the unchecked power of the\r\nFrench artillery fire counted for even more, and not least of the\r\nhindrances was the growing sulkiness of the troops. ‘Siege business\r\nwas new to them, and they wanted confidence; sometimes they would tell\r\nyou that you were taking them to be butchered. The loss, to be sure,\r\nwas sometimes heavy, but it was chiefly occasioned by the confused and\r\nspiritless way in which the men set about their work, added to the\r\ngreat depth we were obliged to excavate in the trenches, to obtain\r\ncover from the commanding fire of the enemy[51].’\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the batteries on San Miguel, when they had ammunition, and\r\nwhen they could put in a few hours’ work before being silenced by the\r\nfire from the Donjon, continued to pound away at the re-entering angle\r\nin the second _enceinte_ (III in the map), and with more effect than\r\nmight have been expected, for this section of the defences turned out\r\nto have been built with bad material, and crumbled even under such\r\nfeeble shooting as that of Wellington’s ‘lame’ 18-pounders. The French\r\non several days had first to silence the English battery, and then to\r\nrebuild the wall with sandbags and earth under a musketry fire from the\r\ntrenches (_a-a_ in the map) upon San Miguel, from which they could not\r\ndrive the sharp-shooters of the besiegers. It was thought later--an _ex\r\npost facto_ judgement--that the best chance of the Allies would have\r\nbeen to attempt a storm on this breach when first it became more or\r\nless practicable. The delay enabled the besieged to execute repairs,\r\nto scarp down the broken front, and to cut off the damaged corner by\r\ninterior retrenchments.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, since doubts were felt as to the main operation of storming\r\nthe new breach, No. III, subsidiary efforts were made to incommode\r\nthe enemy in other ways. At intervals on the 9th, 10th, and 11th\r\nred-hot shot were fired at the church of Santa Maria la Blanca, where\r\nit was known that the French magazine of food lay. The experience of\r\nthe Salamanca forts had led the artillery officers to think that a\r\ngeneral conflagration might be caused. But the plan had no success; the\r\nbuilding proved to be very incombustible, and one or two small fires\r\nwhich burst out were easily extinguished. Another device was to mine\r\nout from the end houses of the city towards the church of San Roman, an\r\nisolated structure lying close under the south-east side of the Castle,\r\nwhich the French held as an outwork. Nothing very decisive could be\r\nhoped from its capture, as if taken it could only serve as a base\r\nfor operations against the two _enceintes_ above it[52]. But, as an\r\neye-witness remarked, at this period of the siege any sort of irregular\r\nscheme was tried, on the off chance of success. By October 17 the mine\r\nhad got well under the little church. A more feasible plan, which might\r\nhave done some good if it had succeeded, was to run out a small mine or\r\nfougasse from the sap-head of the trench in front of breach I to the\r\npalisades of the second _enceinte_. It was a petty business, no more\r\nthan two barrels of powder being used, and only slightly damaged an\r\nangle of the work in front when fired on October 17. An attempt to push\r\non the sap after the explosion was frustrated by the musketry fire of\r\nthe besieged.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the engineers reported that the church of San Roman was\r\ncompletely undermined, and could be blown up at any moment. On the\r\nsame morning the one good and two lame 18-pounders in battery 2 on San\r\nMiguel swept away, not for the first time, the sandbag parapets and\r\n_chevaux de frise_ with which the French had strengthened the breach\r\nIII. They were then turned against the third _enceinte_, immediately\r\nbehind that breach, partly demolished its ‘fraises,’ and even did some\r\ndamage to its rampart. This was as much as could have been expected,\r\nas the whole of the enemy’s guns were, as usual, turned upon the\r\nbattering-guns, and presently obtained the mastery over them, blowing\r\nup an expense-magazine in No. 2, and injuring a gun in No. 1. But in\r\nthe afternoon the defences were in a more battered condition than\r\nusual, and Wellington resolved to make his last attempt. Already\r\nthe French army outside was showing signs of activity; and, as a\r\nprecaution, some of the investing troops--two brigades of the 6th\r\nDivision--had been sent forward to join the covering army. If this\r\nassault failed, the siege would have to be given up, or at the best\r\nturned into a blockade.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the assault was drawn up by Wellington himself, who\r\ndictated the details to his military secretary, Fitzroy Somerset, in\r\nthree successive sections, after inspecting from the nearest possible\r\npoint each of the three fronts which he intended to attack[53].\r\n\r\nStated shortly the plan was as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) At 4.30 the mine at San Roman was to be fired, and the ruins of\r\nthe church seized by Brown’s caçadores (9th battalion), supported by\r\na Spanish regiment (1st of Asturias) lent by Castaños. A brigade of\r\nthe 6th Division was to be ready in the streets behind, to support the\r\nassault, if its effect looked promising, i.e. if the results of the\r\nexplosion should injure the _enceinte_ behind, or should so drive the\r\nenemy from it that an escalade became possible.\r\n\r\n(2) The detachments of the Guards’ brigade of the 1st Division, who\r\nwere that day in charge of the trenches within the captured outer\r\n_enceinte_, and facing the west front of the second _enceinte_, were\r\nto make an attempt to escalade that line of defence, at the point\r\nwhere most of its palisades had been destroyed, opposite and above the\r\noriginal breach No. I in the lower _enceinte_.\r\n\r\n(3) The detachments of the German brigade of the 1st Division, who\r\nwere to take charge of the trenches for the evening in succession to\r\nthe Guards, were to attempt to storm the breach III in the re-entering\r\nangle, the only point where there was an actual opening prepared into\r\nthe inner defences.\r\n\r\nFrom all the works, both those on St. Miguel and those to the west\r\nof the Castle, marksmen left in the trenches were to keep up as hot\r\na musketry fire as possible on any of the enemy who should show\r\nthemselves, so as to distract their attention from the stormers.\r\n\r\nThe most notable point in these instructions was the small number of\r\nmen devoted to the two serious attacks. Provision was made for the use\r\nof 300 men only in the attack to be made by the Guards: they were to\r\nmove forward in successive rushes--the first or forlorn hope consisting\r\nof an officer and twenty men, the supports or main assaulting force, of\r\nsmall parties of 40 or 50 men, each of which was to come forward only\r\nwhen the one in front of it had reached a given point in its advance.\r\nSimilarly the German Legion’s assault was to be led by a forlorn\r\nhope of 20, supported by 50 more, who were only to move when their\r\npredecessors had reached the lip of the breach, and by a reserve of 200\r\nwho were to charge out of the trench only when the support was well\r\nestablished on the rampart.\r\n\r\nBurgoyne, the senior engineer present, tells us that he protested all\r\nthrough the siege, at each successive assault, against the paucity of\r\nthe numbers employed, saying that the forlorn hope had, in fact, to\r\ntake the work by itself, since they had no close and strong column in\r\nimmediate support; and if the forlorn hope failed, ‘the next party,\r\nwho from behind their cover have seen them bayoneted, are expected\r\nto valiantly jump up and proceed to be served in the same way.’\r\nHe reminded Wellington, as he says, that the garrison at Burgos\r\nwas as large as that at Ciudad Rodrigo, where two whole divisions\r\ninstead of 500 or 600 men had been thrown into the assault. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief, condescending to argument for once, replied, ‘why\r\nexpose more men than can ascend the ladders [as at the Guards’ attack]\r\nor enter the work [as at the breach in the K.G.L. attack] at one time,\r\nwhen by this mode the support is ordered to be up in time to follow the\r\ntail of the preceding party[54]?’ And his objection to the engineer’s\r\nplea was clinched by the dictum, ‘if we fail we can’t lose many men.’\r\nThis controversy originally arose on the details of the abortive storm\r\nof September 22, but Burgoyne’s criticism was even more convincing\r\nfor the details of the final assault on October 18. The number of men\r\nrisked was far too small for the task that was set them.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy story of the storm runs as follows. On the explosion of\r\nthe mine at San Roman, punctually at 4.30, all three of the sections\r\nof the assault were duly delivered. At the breach the forlorn hope of\r\nthe King’s German Legion charged at the rough slope with great speed,\r\nreached the crest, and were immediately joined by the support, led most\r\ngallantly by Major Wurmb of the 5th Line Battalion. The first rush\r\ncleared a considerable length of the rampart of its defenders, till it\r\nwas checked against a stockade, part of the works which the French had\r\nbuilt to cut off the breach from the main body of the place. Foiled\r\nhere, on the flank, some of the Germans turned, and made a dash at the\r\ninjured rampart of the third line, in their immediate front: three or\r\nfour actually reached the parapet of this inmost defence of the enemy.\r\nBut they fell, and the main body, penned in the narrow space between\r\nthe two _enceintes_, became exposed to such an overpowering fire of\r\nmusketry that, after losing nearly one man in three, they finally\r\nhad to give way, and retired most reluctantly down the breach to the\r\ntrenches they had left. The casualties out of 300 men engaged were no\r\nless than 82 killed and wounded[55], among the former, Wurmb, who had\r\nled the assault, and among the latter, Hesse, who commanded the forlorn\r\nhope, and was one of the few who scaled the inner wall as well as the\r\nouter.\r\n\r\nThe Guards in their attack, 100 yards to the right of the breach,\r\nhad an even harder task than the Germans, for their storm was a mere\r\nescalade. It was executed with great decision: issuing from the front\r\ntrench they ran up to the line of broken palisades, passed through\r\ngaps in it, and applied their ladders to the face of the rampart of\r\nthe second _enceinte_. Many of them succeeded in mounting, and they\r\nestablished themselves successfully on the parapet, and seized a long\r\nstretch of it, so long that some of their left-hand men got into touch\r\nwith the Germans who had entered at the breach. But they could not\r\nclear the enemy out of the _terre-pleine_ of the second _enceinte_,\r\nwhere a solid body of the French kept up a rolling fire upon them,\r\nwhile the garrison of the upper line maintained a still fiercer\r\nfusillade from their high-lying point of vantage. The Guards were for\r\nabout ten minutes within the wall, and made several attempts to get\r\nforward without success. At the end of that time a French reserve\r\nadvanced from their left, and charging in flank the disordered mass\r\nwithin the _enceinte_ drove them out again. The Guards retired as best\r\nthey could to the advanced trenches, having lost 85 officers and men\r\nout of the 300 engaged. The French returned their casualties at 11\r\nkilled and 30 wounded.\r\n\r\nWellington’s dispatch, narrating the disaster, gives the most handsome\r\ntestimonial to the resolution of both the bodies of stormers. ‘It is\r\nimpossible to represent in adequate terms the conduct of the Guards and\r\nthe German Legion upon this occasion. And I am quite satisfied that\r\nif it had been possible to maintain the posts which they gained with\r\nso much gallantry, these troops would have maintained them[56].’ But\r\nwhy were 600 men only sent forward, and no support given them during\r\nthe precious ten minutes when their first rush had carried them within\r\nthe walls? Where were the brigades to which the stormers belonged?\r\nIt is impossible not to subscribe to Burgoyne’s angry comment that\r\n‘the miserable, doubting, unmilitary policy of small storming-parties’\r\ncaused the mischief[57]. He adds, ‘large bodies encourage one another,\r\nand carry with them confidence of success: if the Castle of Badajoz\r\nwas stormed with ten or twelve ladders, and not more than 40 or 50 men\r\ncould mount at once, I am convinced that it was only carried because\r\nthe whole 3rd Division was there, and the emulation between the\r\nofficers of the different regiments got their men to mount; although we\r\nlost 600 or 700 men, it caused success--which eventually saves men.’\r\n\r\nThe third section of the assault of October 18, the unimportant attack\r\non the church of San Roman, had a certain measure of success. The mine,\r\nthough it did not level the whole building, as had been hoped, blew up\r\nthe terrace in front of, and part of its west end. Thereupon the French\r\nevacuated it, after exploding a mine of their own which brought down\r\nthe bell-tower and much more, and crushed a few of the caçadores and\r\nSpaniards[58] who were ahead of their comrades. The besiegers were able\r\nto lodge themselves in the ruins, but could make no attempt to approach\r\nthe actual walls of the second _enceinte_. So the 6th Division remained\r\nbehind, within the streets of Burgos, and never came forward or showed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSuch was the unhappy end of this most unlucky siege. All through the\r\nday of the assault there had been heavy skirmishing going on at the\r\noutposts of the covering army; Souham was at last on the move. On the\r\n19th the Guards’ brigade and the K.G.L. brigade of the 1st Division\r\nmarched to join the 5th and 7th Divisions at the front, leaving only\r\nthe line brigade (Stirling’s) to hold the trenches on the north and\r\nwest sides of the Castle. Two-thirds of the 6th Division had already\r\ngone off in the same direction before the storm: now the rest followed,\r\nhanding over the charge of Burgos city and the chain of picquets on the\r\neast side of the Castle to Pack’s Portuguese. There was little doing\r\nin the lines this day--the French built up the oft-destroyed parapet of\r\nbreach III with sandbags, and made an incursion into the church of San\r\nRoman, driving out the Portuguese guard for a short time, and injuring\r\nthe lodgement which had been made in the ruins. But they withdrew when\r\nthe supports came up.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th, news being serious at the front--for Souham showed\r\nsigns of intending to attack in force, and it was ascertained that\r\nhe had been reinforced by great part of the Army of the North, under\r\nCaffarelli in person--Wellington gave orders to withdraw the guns\r\nfrom the batteries, leaving only two of the captured French pieces\r\nto fire an occasional shot. All transportable stores and ammunition\r\nwere ordered to be loaded up. There was some bickering in San Roman\r\nthis day, but at night the Portuguese were again in possession of the\r\nmuch-battered church.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st came the final orders for retreat. The artillery were\r\ndirected to burn all that could not be carried off--platforms,\r\nfascines, &c.--to blow up the works on San Miguel, and to retire down\r\nthe high-road to Valladolid. The three 18-pounders were taken a few\r\nmiles only. The roads being bad from heavy rain, and the bullocks weak,\r\nit was held that there was no profit in dragging about the two guns\r\nwhich had lost trunnions and were practically useless. The surviving\r\nintact gun shared the fate of its two ‘lame’ fellows: all three were\r\nwrecked[59], their carriages were destroyed, and they were thrown out\r\non the side of the road. The artillery reserve, now reduced to the five\r\nineffective 24-lb. howitzers, then continued its retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURGOS]\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 21st-22nd, Pack’s brigade and the other troops left\r\nto hold the works retired, the covering army being now in full retreat\r\nby various roads passing through or around the city. The main column\r\ncrossed at the town bridge--the artillery with wheels muffled with\r\nstraw to deaden their rumbling--risking the danger of being shelled\r\nin the darkness by the Castle, which had several guns that bore upon\r\nit. The long series of mishaps which constituted the history of the\r\nsiege of Burgos ended by the failure of the plan for the explosions on\r\nSan Miguel: the French found there next day more than twenty barrels of\r\npowder intact. The arsenal in the town was fired when the last troops\r\nhad passed, but was only partly consumed. Next morning (October 22) the\r\nadvanced guard of the Army of Portugal entered Burgos, and relieved\r\nthe garrison after thirty-five days of siege. Dubreton had still\r\nnearly 1,200 effective men under arms: he had lost in his admirable\r\nand obstinate defence 16 officers and 607 men, of whom 304 were killed\r\nor died of their wounds. The corresponding total British casualty list\r\nwas no less than 24 officers and 485 men killed, 68 officers and 1,487\r\nmen wounded and missing [the last item accounting for 2 officers and\r\n42 men]. Almost the whole of the loss came from the ranks of the 1st\r\nDivision and Pack’s Portuguese, the 6th Division troops having had\r\nlittle to do with the trenches or assaults[60].\r\n\r\nThe external causes of the raising of the siege will be dealt with in\r\ntheir proper place--the strategical narrative of the general condition\r\nof affairs in both the Castiles which opens the next chapter. Here it\r\nremains only to recapitulate the various reasons which made the siege\r\nitself a failure. They have been summed up by several writers of weight\r\nand experience--John Jones, the official historian of the sieges of\r\nSpain, John Burgoyne the commanding engineer, William Napier, and\r\nBelmas the French author, who (using Jones as a primary authority) told\r\nits story from the side of the besieged. Comparing all their views with\r\nthe detailed chronicle of the operations of those thirty-five eventful\r\ndays, the following results seem to emerge.\r\n\r\n(1) Burgos would not have been a strong fortress against an army\r\nprovided with a proper battering-train, such as that which dealt with\r\nCiudad Rodrigo or Badajoz. But Wellington--by his own fault as it\r\nturned out in the end--had practically no such train at all: three\r\n18-pound heavy guns were an absurd provision for the siege of a place\r\nof even third-rate strength. If Wellington had realized on September 20\r\nthat the siege was to last till October 21, he might have had almost as\r\nmany guns as he pleased. But the strength of Burgos was underrated at\r\nthe first; and by the time that it was realized, Wellington considered\r\n(wrongly, as it turned out) that it was too late to get the necessary\r\nordnance from the distant places where it lay.\r\n\r\n(2) Encouraged by the experience of Badajoz and Almaraz, Wellington and\r\nhis staff considered that an imperfect fortification like the Castle of\r\nBurgos might be dealt with by escalade without artillery preparation.\r\nThe Hornwork of San Miguel was taken on this irregular system; but the\r\nattempts against the _enceintes_ of the Castle failed. Burgoyne is\r\nprobably right in maintaining that the repeated failures were largely\r\ndue to the general’s reluctance to put in large masses of men at once,\r\nowing to his wish to spare the lives in units already worked down to a\r\nlow strength by long campaigning. The principle ‘if we fail we can’t\r\nlose many men’ was ruinous. On October 18 the place _must_ have fallen\r\nif 3,000 instead of 600 men had been told off for the assault.\r\n\r\n(3) Notwithstanding the lack of artillery, Burgos might have been\r\ntaken if Wellington had owned a large and efficient body of engineers.\r\nBut (as at Badajoz, where he had made bitter complaints on this\r\nsubject[61]) the provision of trained men was ludicrously small--there\r\nwere just five officers of Royal Engineers[62] with the army, and\r\neight ‘Royal Military Artificers’. The volunteers from the Line, both\r\nofficers and men, used as auxiliaries, were not up to the work required\r\nof them. It was a misfortune that none of the divisions before Burgos\r\nhad experience of siege-work, like that which the Light, 3rd, and 4th\r\nDivisions (all left at Madrid) had been through.\r\n\r\n(4) After the heavy losses in the early assaults the rank and file,\r\nboth the British and still more the Portuguese, were much discouraged.\r\nAs Burgoyne says, ‘the place might have been, and ought to have been,\r\ntaken if every one had done his duty[63].’ In the actual assaults\r\nsplendid courage was often displayed, but in the trench-work there was\r\nmuch sulkiness, apathy, and even shirking. ‘Our undertaking, every\r\nnight that we broke ground, appeared most pitiful: there was scarcely\r\na single instance where at least double the work was not projected,\r\nwith sufficient men and tools collected, that was afterwards executed,\r\nowing to the neglect and misconduct of the working parties. It was\r\nseldom that the men could be induced to take out their gabions and set\r\nto work, and I myself placed at different times hundreds of gabions\r\nwith my own hands, and then _entreated_ the men to go and fill them, to\r\nno purpose. The engineers blamed the men--the men blamed the engineers,\r\nwho, as they grumbled, were by unskilful direction ‘sending them out\r\nto be butchered[64].’ All this, in the end, was due to the want of\r\nartillery for proper preparation, and of trained sappers.\r\n\r\n(5) Burgoyne, D’Urban, and other observers are probably right in saying\r\nthat the failure of the assaults was partly due to the bad principle\r\nof composing the storming-parties of drafts from many different corps,\r\ncollected, under officers whom they did not personally know, from\r\nthe units that chanced to be on duty that day. The one case where a\r\nbrilliant success was scored with small loss, was seen when a whole\r\nbattalion, the 2/24th, carried the outer _enceinte_ on October 4.\r\n\r\n(6) Wellington’s doubts, expressed almost from the first, as to the\r\npracticability of the affair that he had taken in hand, were known to\r\nmany officers, and affected the general morale.\r\n\r\n(7) Dubreton deserves unstinted praise. A general of more ordinary\r\ntype, such as Barrois at Ciudad Rodrigo, would have lost Burgos for\r\nwant of the extraordinary resourcefulness, determination, and quick\r\ndecision shown by this admirable governor. His garrison must share his\r\nglory: the French 34th certainly got in this siege a good _revanche_\r\nfor their last military experience, the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S RETREAT FROM BURGOS: OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 1812. (1) FROM THE\r\nARLANZON TO THE DOURO: OCTOBER 22-OCTOBER 30\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving completed the depressing chronicle of the leaguer of the Castle\r\nof Burgos, it is necessary that we should turn back for a week or two,\r\nto examine the changing aspect of external affairs, which had affected\r\nthe general strategical position in Spain while the siege lingered\r\non. It will be remembered that the original scheme for the campaign\r\nhad been that, after the Army of Portugal had been pushed back to\r\nthe Ebro, a great part of Wellington’s field force should return to\r\nMadrid, to pick up the divisions left there, and the corps of Hill,\r\nbefore Soult and King Joseph should begin to give trouble on the side\r\nof Valencia. Only a containing force was to have been left behind, to\r\naid Castaños and his Galicians in keeping Clausel (or his successor\r\nSouham) out of mischief, while more important movements were on foot\r\nin New Castile[65]. As to the command of this containing force there\r\nwas a difficulty: Wellington was not at all satisfied with the way in\r\nwhich Clinton had handled the troops left on the Douro in August, and\r\nit seems doubtful whether he wished to give him a far more important\r\ncommission in the first half of October, when he was the natural person\r\nto be chosen for it. For at this time none of the other senior officers\r\nwho had served in the recent campaigns were available: Beresford,\r\nStapleton Cotton, and Picton were all three invalided at the moment.\r\nGraham, the best of them all, had returned to England. Hill could not\r\nbe removed from the charge of his old army in the South. Of the five\r\ndivisions before Burgos four were commanded by brigadiers acting in\r\nthe position of _locum tenens_[66]: most of the brigades were, in a\r\nsimilar fashion, being worked by colonels for want of a sufficient\r\nnumber of major-generals to go round. But after October 11th the formal\r\ndifficulty was solved: there was now available an officer whom it was\r\nfitting to leave in charge against Souham, viz. Sir Edward Paget,\r\nwho came up to the front on that day, after having been three years\r\nabsent from the Peninsula; he had last served under Wellington at the\r\nPassage of the Douro in 1809, where he lost an arm. He had now come\r\nout nominally to succeed Graham at the head of the 1st Division, but\r\nalso with the commission to act as second-in-command in the event of\r\nthe illness or disabling of the general-in-chief. Paget was known as\r\na good soldier, and had served with distinction during the Corunna\r\nretreat; but he had never been trusted with the management of a large\r\nforce, and had little knowledge either of the army which Wellington had\r\ntrained, or of the parts of Spain in which the campaign was now going\r\non. Moreover, Wellington disliked on principle the idea of having a\r\nsecond-in-command, occupying to a certain extent a position independent\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\nThe separate containing force never came into existence, because\r\nWellington never left the North or returned to Madrid, though rumours\r\nwere afloat after Paget’s arrival that he was about to do so without\r\ndelay. Why, contrary to his own expressed intentions did he never go\r\nSouth? The answer must certainly be that down to a very late period\r\nof the siege he continued to keep in his mind the idea of returning\r\nto Madrid[67], but that he was distracted from his purpose by several\r\nconsiderations. The first was the abominable weather in October, which\r\nmade the prospect of a long forced march distasteful--the army was\r\nsickly and would suffer. The second was his insufficient realization\r\nof the nearness of the danger in the South: he thought that Hill was\r\nin a less perilous position than was actually the case. The third was\r\nthat he was beginning to mark the growing strength of the Army of\r\nPortugal, which lay in his own front, and to see that he could not hope\r\nto ‘contain’ it by any mere detachment, if he departed for the South\r\nwith his main body. Souham’s host was no longer a spent force, which\r\ncould be ignored as a source of danger; if Wellington took away two or\r\nthree divisions, the officer left in charge in the North would be at\r\nonce assailed by very superior numbers. He did not like the idea of\r\ntrusting either Clinton or Paget with the conduct of a retreat before\r\nan enemy who would certainly press him fiercely. In addition, there\r\nwas the lingering hope that Burgos might fall: if it were captured the\r\nsituation would be much improved, since the allies could use it as a\r\nsort of _point d’appui_--to use the terminology of the day--on which\r\nthe containing army could rest; and the enemy would be forced to detach\r\nheavily for the investment of the place.\r\n\r\nBy the day of the last assault (October 18) Wellington had clearly\r\nlingered too long, for very large reinforcements had just come up to\r\njoin Souham, who on that morning was in a position to evict from before\r\nBurgos not only any mere ‘covering force’ that might be left opposite\r\nhim, but the whole 35,000 men which formed the total of the allied\r\nhost. For by now the Army of Portugal was recruited up to a strength\r\nof 38,000 men present with the colours: it had also just received\r\nthe disposable battalions of the Bayonne Reserve, a strong brigade\r\nof 3,500 men under General Aussenac, and what was more important\r\nstill--Caffarelli had appeared at Briviesca with the main field-force\r\nof the Army of the North. The operations of Home Popham, Mendizabal,\r\nMina and Longa, which had detained and confused the French troops in\r\nBiscay and Navarre for the whole summer, had at last reached their\r\nlimits of success, and having patched up affairs on the coast, and left\r\nsome 20,000 men to hold the garrison places, and to curb the further\r\nraids of the British commodore and the Spanish bands, Caffarelli had\r\ncome southwards with the whole of his cavalry--1,600 sabres,--three\r\nbatteries, and nearly 10,000 infantry, forming the greater part of the\r\ndivisions of Vandermaesen and Dumoustier. There were something like\r\n50,000 French concentrated between Pancorbo and Briviesca on October\r\n18th[68], while Wellington--allowing for his losses in the siege--had\r\nnot more than 24,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 11,000 Spaniards in hand. The\r\narrival of the Army of the North not only made the further continuance\r\nof the siege of Burgos impossible, but placed Wellington in a condition\r\nof great danger. It is clear that his campaign in the North had only\r\nbeen able to continue for so long as it did because Popham, Mina, and\r\nthe Cantabrian bands had kept Caffarelli employed for a time that\r\nexceeded all reasonable expectation. It was really surprising that a\r\nsmall squadron and 10,000 half-organized troops, of whom a large part\r\nwere undisciplined guerrillero bands, and the rest not much better,\r\nshould have held the 37,000 men of the Army of the North in play for\r\nthree months. But the combination of a mobile naval force, and of\r\nlocal levies who knew every goat-path of their native mountains, had\r\nproved efficacious in the extreme. It had taken Caffarelli the whole\r\nsummer and much of the autumn to vindicate his position, and recover\r\nthe more important strategical points in his wide domain. Even when\r\nhe was marching on Burgos there was fierce fighting going on round\r\nPampeluna, on which Mina had pressed in more closely when he heard of\r\nthe departure of the general-in-chief. The Cantabrians and Navarrese\r\ndid marvels for Wellington, and their work has never been properly\r\nacknowledged by British writers.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the whole situation would have been different if\r\nWellington had brought up to the North in September the 16,000 veteran\r\nBritish troops left at Madrid. For want of them he was in a state\r\nof hopeless inferiority to his immediate opponents. And yet at the\r\nsame time they were useless at Madrid, because Hill--even with their\r\naid--was not nearly strong enough to keep Soult and King Joseph in\r\ncheck. Wellington had in all at this time some 55,000 Anglo-Portuguese\r\ntroops under arms and at the front; but they were so dispersed that on\r\nboth theatres of war he was inferior to his enemies. He had 24,000\r\nhimself in Old Castile--Hill some 31,000 in New Castile; each of the\r\ntwo halves of the army could count on the help of some 10,000 or 12,000\r\nSpaniards[69]. But of what avail were the 35,000 men of all nations\r\nat Burgos against the 50,000 French under Souham and Caffarelli, or\r\nthe 43,000 men of all nations near Madrid against the 60,000 of Soult\r\nand the King? The whole situation would have been different if a\r\nsuperiority or even an equality of numbers had been established against\r\none of the two French armies; and it is clear that such a combination\r\ncould have been contrived, if Wellington had adopted other plans.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the excessive tardiness of Soult’s\r\nevacuation of Andalusia was the fact which caused the unlucky\r\ndistribution of Wellington’s forces in October. The Marshal, it will be\r\nremembered, only left Granada on September 16th, and did not come into\r\ntouch with the outlying cavalry of the Valencian Army till September\r\n29-30, or reach Almanza, where he was in full connexion with Suchet\r\nand King Joseph, till October 2. There was, therefore, no threatening\r\ncombination of enemies on the Valencia side till thirteen days after\r\nthe siege of Burgos had begun; and Wellington did not know that it had\r\ncome into existence till October 9th, when he received a dispatch from\r\nHill informing him that the long foreseen, but long deferred, junction\r\nhad taken place. If it had occurred--as it well might have--three weeks\r\nearlier, there would have been no siege of Burgos, and Wellington would\r\nhave been at Madrid, after having contented himself with driving the\r\narmy of Portugal beyond the Douro. It is probable that he would have\r\ndone well, even at so late a date as October 9th, if he had recognized\r\nthat the danger in front of Madrid was now pressing, and had abandoned\r\nthe siege of Burgos, in order to make new arrangements. Souham was not\r\nyet in a condition to press him, and Caffarelli’s 10,000 men had not\r\narrived on the scene. But the last twelve days spent before Burgos\r\nruined his chances.\r\n\r\nOn getting Hill’s dispatch Wellington pondered much--but came to an\r\nunhappy decision. In his reply he wrote, ‘I cannot believe that Soult\r\nand the King can venture to move forward to attack you in the position\r\non the Tagus, without having possession of the fortresses in the\r\nprovince of Murcia [Cartagena and Chinchilla] and of Alicante;--unless\r\nindeed they propose to give up Valencia entirely. They would in that\r\ncase[70] bring with them a most overwhelming force, and you would\r\nprobably have to retire in the direction given to General Alten [i.e.\r\nby the Guadarrama Pass, Villa Castin, and Arevalo] and I should then\r\njoin you on the Adaja. If you retire in that direction, destroy the\r\nnew bridge at Almaraz.... I write this, as I always do, to provide\r\nfor every event, not believing that these instructions are at all\r\nnecessary[71].’\r\n\r\nIn a supplementary letter, dated two days later, Wellington tells Hill\r\nthat he imagines that the autumn rains, which have made the siege of\r\nBurgos so difficult, will probably have rendered the rivers of the\r\nSouth impassable. ‘I should think that you will have the Tagus in\r\nsuch a state as to feel in no apprehension in regard to the enemy’s\r\noperations, be his numbers what they may[72].’ Yet though he does not\r\nconsider the danger in the South immediate or pressing, he acknowledges\r\nthat he ought to bring the siege of Burgos to an end, even though it be\r\nnecessary to raise it, and to give up the hope of its capture. But the\r\ncontinual storms and rains induced him to delay his departure toward\r\nthe South: ‘I shall do so as soon as the weather holds up a little.’\r\nOn the same day (October 12) he wrote to Popham to say that if he had\r\nto march towards Madrid, he expected that Souham would follow him, but\r\nthat Caffarelli must on no account be allowed to accompany Souham.\r\nAt all costs more trouble must be made in Cantabria and Biscay, to\r\nprevent the Army of the North from moving. Popham must not withdraw\r\nhis squadron, or cease from stimulating the Northern insurgents[73].\r\nWellington was not aware that Caffarelli was already on the move, and\r\nthat the diversion in the North--through no fault of the officers in\r\ncharge of it--had reached its limit of success.\r\n\r\nThe moment had now arrived at which it was necessary at all costs to\r\ncome to some decision as to the movements of the Army at Burgos, for\r\nCaffarelli (though Wellington knew it not) had started for Briviesca,\r\nwhile Soult and King Joseph were also getting ready for an immediate\r\nadvance on Madrid, which must bring matters in the South to a head.\r\nBut relying on letters from Hill, dated October 10th, which stated\r\nthat there was still no signs of movement opposite him, Wellington\r\nresolved on October 14 to stay yet another week in the North, and try\r\nhis final assault on Burgos: it came off with no success (as will be\r\nremembered) on the 18th of that month. He was not blind to the possible\r\nconsequences to Hill of a prompt advance of the French armies from\r\nValencia, but he persuaded himself that the weather would make it\r\ndifficult, and that he had means of detaining Soult and Joseph, if they\r\nshould, after all, begin the move which he doubted that they proposed\r\nto make.\r\n\r\nThe scheme for stopping any forward march on the part of the French\r\nhad two sections. The first was to be executed by the Anglo-Spanish\r\nArmy at Alicante. Maitland had fallen sick, and this force of some\r\n16,000 men was now under the charge of General John Mackenzie. To this\r\nofficer Wellington wrote on October 13th: ‘In case the enemy should\r\nadvance from Valencia into La Mancha, with a view to attack our troops\r\non the Tagus, you must endeavour to obtain possession of the town and\r\nkingdom of Valencia.’ He was given the option of marching by land from\r\nAlicante, or of putting his men on shipboard and making a descent from\r\nthe sea on Valencia[74]. The second diversion was to be executed by\r\nBallasteros and the Army of Andalusia. Wellington wrote to him that\r\nhe should advance from Granada, cross the Sierra Morena with all his\r\navailable strength, and place himself at Alcaraz in La Mancha[75]. He\r\nought to have at least 12,000 men, as some of the Cadiz troops were\r\ncoming up to join him. Such a force, if placed on the flank of Soult\r\nand the King, when they should move forward for Almanza and Albacete,\r\ncould not be ignored. And Wellington hoped to reinforce Ballasteros\r\nwith that part of the Murcian Army, under Elio and Freire, which had\r\ngot separated from the Alicante force, and had fallen back into the\r\ninland. There were also irregular bodies, such as the division of the\r\nEmpecinado, which could be called in to join, and if 20,000 men lay at\r\nAlcaraz, Soult could not go in full force to assail Hill in front of\r\nMadrid. He must make such a large detachment to watch the Spaniards\r\nthat he would not have more than 30,000 or 35,000 men to make the\r\nfrontal attack on the Anglo-Portuguese force, which would defend the\r\nline of the Tagus. Against such numbers Hill could easily hold his\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to these schemes that they did not allow sufficient\r\nconsideration to the power of Suchet in Valencia. Mackenzie’s force,\r\nof a very heterogeneous kind, was not capable of driving in the\r\ndetachments of the Army of Aragon, which still lay cantoned along the\r\nXucar, facing the Allies at Alicante. Suchet was able to hold his own,\r\nwithout detaining any of the troops of Soult or of King Joseph from\r\ntheir advance upon Madrid. Mackenzie’s projected expedition against\r\nthe city of Valencia had no chance of putting a check upon the main\r\nmanœuvre that the French had in hand.\r\n\r\nBut the use of Ballasteros, whose movement must certainly have\r\nexercised an immense restraining power upon Soult and King Joseph,\r\nif only it had been carried out, was an experiment of a kind which\r\nWellington had tried before, nearly always with disappointing results.\r\nTo entrust to a Spanish general an essential part of a wide strategical\r\nplan had proved ere now a doubtful expedient. And Ballasteros had\r\nalways shown himself self-willed if energetic; it was dangerous to\r\nreckon upon him as a loyal and intelligent assistant in the great\r\ngame. And at this moment the captain-general of Andalusia was in\r\nthe most perverse of moods. His ill temper was caused by the recent\r\nappointment of Wellington as commander-in-chief of all the Spanish\r\narmies, a measure to which the Cortes had at last consented, after the\r\nconsequences of the battle of Salamanca and the occupation of Madrid\r\nhad prepared public opinion for this momentous step. It had been\r\nbitterly opposed at the secret session when it was brought forward, but\r\nthere could no longer be any valid excuse for putting off the obviously\r\nnecessary policy of combining all military effort in the Peninsula, by\r\nplacing the control of the whole of the Spanish armies in the hands of\r\none who had shown himself such a master of the art of war.\r\n\r\nWellington’s nomination as Generalissimo of the Spanish armies had\r\nbeen voted by the Cortes on September 22nd, and conveyed to him before\r\nBurgos on October 2nd. He had every intention of accepting the offer,\r\nthough (as he wrote to his brother Henry[76]) the change in his\r\nposition would not be so great in reality as in form, since Castaños\r\nand most of the other Spanish generals had of late been wont to consult\r\nhim on their movements, and generally to fall in with his views.\r\nThere had been exceptions, even of late, such as Joseph O’Donnell’s\r\ngratuitous forcing on of battle at Castalla, when he had been specially\r\nasked to hold back till the Anglo-Sicilian expedition began to work\r\nupon the East Coast. But it would certainly be advantageous that,\r\nfor the future, he should be able to issue orders instead of advice.\r\nMeanwhile he could not formally accept the post of general-in-chief\r\nwithout the official leave of the Prince Regent, and prompt information\r\nof the offer and a request for permission to accept it, were sent to\r\nLondon. The Cortes, foreseeing the necessary delay, had refrained from\r\npublishing the decree till it should be certain that Wellington was\r\nprepared to assume the position that was offered him. But the fact\r\nsoon became known in Cadiz, and was openly spoken of in the public\r\npress. Wellington continued to write only letters of advice to the\r\nSpanish generals, and did not assume the tone of a commander-in-chief\r\nas yet, but his advice had already a more binding force. There was\r\nno opposition made to him, save in one quarter--but that was the\r\nmost important one. Ballasteros, as Commander of the 4th Army and\r\nCaptain-General of Andalusia, burst out into open revolt against the\r\nCortes, the Regency, and the commander-in-chief elect.\r\n\r\nThis busy and ambitious man had taken up his abode in Granada, after\r\nSoult’s departure on September 23rd, and since then had not stirred,\r\nthough Wellington had repeatedly asked him to advance into La Mancha\r\nwith his available force, and to put himself in touch with Elio,\r\nPenne Villemur, and Hill. But Ballasteros was suffering from an acute\r\nattack of megalomania: after years of skulking in the mountains and\r\nforced marches, he was now in the position of a viceroy commanding\r\nthe resources of a great province. Though Andalusia had been cleared\r\nof the French by no merit of his, but as a side-effect of the battle\r\nof Salamanca, he gave himself the airs of a conqueror and deliverer,\r\nand fully believed himself to be the most important person in Spain.\r\nAs an acute observer remarked, ‘Ballasteros wanted to begin where\r\nBonaparte ended, by seizing supreme authority, though he had performed\r\nno such services for his fatherland as the French general. He spared\r\nno effort to attach his army to his person, and to win its favour\r\nsacrificed without hesitation the whole civil population. The land was\r\ndrained of all resources, but he found new means of extorting money.\r\nHis officers went from town to town exacting a so-called “voluntary\r\ncontribution” for the army. Those who gave much were put in his white\r\nbook as patriots--those who did not were enrolled in his black book\r\nas supporters of King Joseph. He wanted to collect all the troops in\r\nAndalusia into a great army, with himself as commander. But the Regency\r\ndirected him, in accordance with Wellington’s advice, to march at once\r\nwith the troops immediately available and take post in La Mancha[77].’\r\n\r\nThen came the news of Wellington’s nomination as commander-in-chief.\r\nBallasteros thought the moment favourable for an open bid for the\r\ndictatorship. Instead of obeying the orders sent, he issued on October\r\n23rd a manifesto directed to the Regency, in which he declared that\r\nWellington’s appointment to supreme power was an insult to the Spanish\r\nnation, and especially to the Spanish Army. He openly contemned the\r\ndecree, as dishonourable and debasing--Spaniards should never become\r\nlike Portuguese the servants of the foreigner. If--what he could not\r\nbelieve--the national army and the nation itself should ratify such\r\nan appointment, he himself would throw up his post and retire to his\r\nhome. At the same time there was an outburst of pamphlets and newspaper\r\narticles inspired by him, stating that England was to be feared as an\r\noppressor no less than France; and all sorts of absurd rumours were put\r\nabout as to the intentions of the British Government and the servility\r\nof the Cortes.\r\n\r\nBallasteros, however, had altogether mistaken his own importance\r\nand popularity: budding Bonapartes must be able to rely on their\r\nown troops, and he--as the event showed--could not. The Cortes took\r\nprompt measures for his suppression: one Colonel Rivera, a well-known\r\nLiberal, was sent secretly to Granada to bear to Virues, the second in\r\ncommand of the 4th Army, orders to arrest his chief, and place him in\r\nconfinement. And this was done without any difficulty, so unfounded\r\nwas the confidence which Ballasteros had placed in his omnipotence\r\nwith the army. Virues and the Prince of Anglona, his two divisional\r\ngenerals, carried out the arrest in the simplest fashion. On the\r\nmorning of October 30th they ordered out their troops for a field day\r\non the Alcalá road, save a battalion of the Spanish Guards, who had not\r\nbelonged to Ballasteros’s old army, and had no affection for him. This\r\nregiment surrounded his residence, and when he issued out the picquet\r\nrefused him passage, and Colonel Rivera presented him with the warrant\r\nfor his arrest. There was some little stir in Granada among the civil\r\npopulation, but the army made no movement when Virues read the decree\r\nof the Cortes to them. Before he well understood what had happened,\r\nBallasteros was on his way under a guard to the African fortress of\r\nCeuta. He was afterwards given Fregenal in Estremadura as the place of\r\nhis detention.\r\n\r\nBut all this happened on October 30th, and meanwhile the Army of\r\nAndalusia had remained motionless, though Wellington had believed\r\nthat it had marched for La Mancha as early as October 5th[78]. Nearly\r\na month had been lost by Ballasteros’s perversity, and when he was\r\nfinally arrested and his troops became available, it was too late; for\r\nHill had been forced to retreat, and Madrid was about to fall into the\r\nhands of the French, who had advanced through La Mancha unmolested.\r\nThe Fourth Army was put under the command of the Duke del Parque, the\r\nvictor of Tamames, but the vanquished of Alba de Tormes in the campaign\r\nof 1809. It marched early in November to its appointed position at\r\nAlcaraz; but it was of no use to have it there when the enemy had\r\nchanged all his positions, and had driven Hill beyond the Guadarrama\r\ninto the valley of the Douro.\r\n\r\nWellington’s arrangements for the defence of Madrid were therefore\r\ninsufficient as the event proved, for three reasons. The diversion from\r\nAlicante was too weak--Suchet alone was able to keep Maitland in check.\r\nThe main Spanish force which was to have co-operated with Hill never\r\nput in an appearance, thanks to the disloyal perversity of its general.\r\nAnd, thirdly, the autumn rains, which had so incommoded Wellington\r\nbefore Burgos, turned out to be late and scanty in New Castile. The\r\nTagus and its affluents remained low and fordable almost everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs late as the 17th October Wellington had no fears about Hill’s\r\nposition. The probability that the enemy from Valencia would advance\r\nupon Madrid, as he wrote on that morning, seemed diminishing day\r\nby day--reinforcements were coming up from the South to Hill, and\r\nBallasteros was believed to be already posted in La Mancha, ‘which\r\nrenders the enemy’s movement upon the Tagus very improbable[79].’ On\r\nthe 19th, when his last assault on the Castle of Burgos had just been\r\nbeaten off, and he was thinking of retreat, came much less satisfactory\r\nnews from Hill. The enemy seemed to be drawing together: they had laid\r\nsiege to the Castle of Chinchilla, and it was not impossible that\r\nthey were aiming at Madrid, perhaps only with a view of forcing the\r\nabandonment of the siege of Burgos, perhaps with serious offensive\r\nintention. If so, Wellington might be caught with not one but both\r\nof the halves of his army exposed to immediate attack by a superior\r\nenemy, who was just assuming the offensive. And the total force of the\r\nFrench was appalling--50,000 men on the Northern field of operations,\r\n60,000 on the other--while the united strength of all the available\r\ntroops under Wellington’s orders was about 80,000, of whom 25,000 were\r\nSpaniards, whose previous record was not in many cases reassuring. He\r\nhad often warned the ministers at home that if the French evacuated\r\noutlying provinces, and collected in great masses, they were too many\r\nfor him[80]. But that ever-possible event had been so long delayed,\r\nthat Wellington had gone on, with a healthy and cheerful opportunism,\r\nfacing the actual situation of affairs without taking too much thought\r\nfor the morrow. Now the conjunction least to be desired appeared to be\r\nat length coming into practical existence and it remained to be seen\r\nwhat could be done.\r\n\r\nAs for his own army, there was no doubt that prompt retreat, first\r\nbeyond the Pisuerga, then beyond the Douro, was necessary. Souham had\r\nalready made his first preliminary forward movement. On the evening\r\nof October 18th a strong advance guard, consisting of a brigade of\r\nMaucune’s division, pushed in upon the front of the allied army at the\r\nvillage of Santa Olalla, and surprised there the outlying picket of\r\nan officer and thirty men of the Brunswick-Oels, who were nearly all\r\ntaken prisoners. The heights above this place commanded the town of\r\nMonasterio, wherefore Wellington directed it to be evacuated, and drew\r\nin its line to a position slightly nearer Burgos, for it was clear that\r\nthere were heavy forces behind the brigade which had formed the French\r\nattacking force[81].\r\n\r\nOn the 19th he was in order of battle with all his army except the\r\ntroops left before Burgos--Pack’s Portuguese, a brigade of the 6th\r\nDivision, and three weak battalions from the 1st Division. The position\r\nextended from Ibeas on the Arlanzon, through Riobena to Soto Palacios,\r\nand was manned by the 1st, 5th, and 7th Divisions, two brigades of\r\nthe 6th, Bradford’s Portuguese, Castaños’s Galicians, and all the\r\ncavalry--about 30,000 men. Wellington expected to be attacked on the\r\n20th, and was not prepared to give back till he had ascertained what\r\nforce was in his front. He knew that the Army of Portugal had been\r\nreinforced, but was not sure whether the report that Caffarelli had\r\ncome up with a large portion of the Army of the North was correct or no.\r\n\r\nSouham’s movement on the 18th had been intended as the commencement\r\nof a general advance: he brought up his whole force to Monasterio,\r\nand he would have attacked on the 20th if he had not received, before\r\ndaybreak, and long ere his troops were under way, a much-delayed\r\ndispatch from King Joseph. It informed him that the whole mass of\r\ntroops from Valencia was on the march for Madrid, that this movement\r\nwould force Wellington to abandon the siege of Burgos and to fall back,\r\nand that he was therefore not to risk a general action, but to advance\r\nwith caution, and pursue the allied force in front of him so soon as it\r\nshould begin to retreat, when it might be pressed with advantage.[82]\r\nHe was to be prepared to link his advance with that of the armies from\r\nthe South, which would have columns in the direction of Cuenca. Souham\r\nwas discontented with the gist of this dispatch, since he had his whole\r\narmy assembled, while Caffarelli was close behind, within supporting\r\ndistance, at Briviesca. He thought that he could have fought with\r\nadvantage, and was probably right, since he and Caffarelli had a marked\r\nsuperiority of numbers, though Wellington’s positions were strong.\r\n\r\nBalked of the battle that he desired, he resolved to make a very\r\nstrong reconnaissance against the allied centre, to see whether the\r\nenemy might already be contemplating retreat, and might consent to be\r\npushed back, and to abandon Burgos. This reconnaissance was conducted\r\nby Maucune’s and Chauvel’s (late Bonnet’s) divisions and a brigade of\r\nlight cavalry: it was directed against Wellington’s centre, in front\r\nof the villages of Quintana Palla and Olmos, where the 7th division\r\nwas posted. Maucune’s troops, forming the front line of the French,\r\nwere hotly engaged in this direction, when Wellington, seeing that\r\nthe main body of the enemy was very remote, and that the two vanguard\r\ndivisions had ventured far forward into his ground, directed Sir Edward\r\nPaget with the 1st and 5th divisions--forming his own left wing--to\r\nswing forward by a diagonal movement and take Maucune in flank. The\r\nFrench general discovered the approaching force only just in time,\r\nand retreated in great haste across the fields, without calling in\r\nhis tirailleurs or forming any regular order of march. Each regiment\r\nmade off by its own way, just early enough to escape Paget’s turning\r\nmovement. The British horse artillery arrived only in time to shell the\r\nlast battalions; the infantry was too far off to reach them. Dusk fell\r\nat this moment, and Paget halted: if there had been one hour more of\r\ndaylight Maucune and Chauvel would have been in an evil case, for they\r\nwere still some distance from their own main body on the Monasterio\r\nposition, and the British cavalry was coming up in haste. The\r\nreconnaissance had been pushed recklessly and too far--in accordance\r\nwith the usual conduct of Maucune, who was (as his conduct at Salamanca\r\nhad proved) a gallant but a very rash leader. The losses on both sides\r\nwere trifling--apparently about 80 in the French ranks[83], and 47 in\r\nthe British 7th division. Paget’s troops did not come under fire.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st Wellington received a letter of Hill’s,\r\nwritten on the 17th, which made it clear to him that he must delay no\r\nlonger. It reported that the enemy were very clearly on the move--the\r\nwhole of Drouet’s corps was coming forward from Albacete, the castle\r\nof Chinchilla had fallen into the hands of the French on Oct. 9th,\r\nand--what was the most discomposing to learn--Ballasteros had failed\r\nto advance into La Mancha: by the last accounts he was still at\r\nGranada. He would certainly come too late, if he came at all. The only\r\ncompensating piece of good news was that Skerrett’s brigade from Cadiz\r\nwas at last near at hand, and would reach Talavera on the 20th. Elio,\r\nfrom his forward position at Villares, reported that Suchet’s troops\r\nopposite Alicante were drawing back towards Valencia; possibly they\r\nwere about to join Soult and King Joseph, who were evidently coming\r\nforward. Hill was inclined to sum up the news as follows: ‘The King,\r\nSoult, and Suchet having united their armies are on the frontiers of\r\nMurcia and Valencia, and appear to be moving this way. It is certain\r\nthat a considerable force is advancing toward Madrid, but I think it\r\ndoubtful whether they will attempt to force their way to the capital.’\r\nMeanwhile he had, as a precautionary measure, brought up the troops in\r\ncantonments round Madrid to Aranjuez and its neighbourhood, and had\r\nthrown forward a cavalry screen beyond the Tagus, to watch alike the\r\nroads from Albacete and those from Cuenca.\r\n\r\nThe mere possibility that Soult and the King were advancing on Madrid\r\nwas enough to move Wellington to instant retreat: if he waited for\r\ncertainty, he might be too late. And his own position in front of\r\nSouham and Caffarelli was dangerous enough, even if no more bad news\r\nfrom the South should come to hand. Accordingly on the afternoon of\r\nthe 21st orders were sent to Pack to prepare to raise the siege of\r\nBurgos, when the main army in its backward movement should have passed\r\nhim. The baggage was to be sent off, the stores removed or burned\r\nin the following night. The divisions in line opposite Souham were\r\nto move away, after lighting camp fires to delude the enemy, in two\r\nmain columns, one on each side of the Arlanzon. The northern column,\r\ncomposed of the 5th Division, two-thirds of the Galician infantry,\r\nthe heavy dragoons of Ponsonby (late Le Marchant’s brigade) and the\r\nhandful of Spanish regular cavalry, was to skirt the northern side\r\nof the city of Burgos, using the cross-roads by Bivar and Quintana\r\nDueñas, and to retire to Tardajos, beside the Urbel river. The southern\r\nand larger column, consisting of the 1st, 7th, and 6th Divisions\r\n(marching in that order), of Bradford’s Portuguese and the remainder\r\nof the Galicians, was to move by the high road through Villa Fria, to\r\ncross the town-bridge of Burgos (with special caution that silence\r\nmust be observed, so as not to alarm the garrison of the Castle) to\r\nFrandovinez and Villa de Buniel. Here they would be in touch with the\r\nother column, which was to be only two miles away at Tardajos. Anson’s\r\ncavalry brigade was to cover the rear of this column, only abandoning\r\nthe outposts when the infantry should have got far forward. They were\r\nto keep the old picquet-line till three in the morning. Bock’s German\r\ndragoons and the cavalry of Julian Sanchez formed a flank guard for the\r\nsouthern column: they were to cross the Arlanzon at Ibeas, five miles\r\neast of Burgos, and to retire parallel to the infantry line of march,\r\nby a circuit on cross-roads south of Burgos, finally joining the main\r\nbody at Villa de Buniel[84].\r\n\r\nAll this complicated set of movements was carried out with complete\r\nsuccess: the army got away without arousing the attention of the French\r\nof Souham, and the column which crossed the bridge of Burgos, under the\r\ncannon of the Castle[85], was never detected, till a Spanish guerrilla\r\nparty galloped noisily across the stones and drew some harmless shots.\r\nSince the enemy was alarmed, the rear of the column had to take a\r\nside-path. Pack filed off the troops in the trenches, and got away\r\nquietly from the investment line. In the morning the two infantry\r\ncolumns were safely concentrated within two miles of each other at\r\nTardajos and Villa de Buniel. There being no sign of pursuit, they were\r\nallowed some hours’ rest in these positions, and then resumed their\r\nretreat, the northern column leading, with the 5th Division at its\r\nhead, the southern column following, and falling into the main road by\r\ncrossing the bridge of Buniel. The 7th Division formed the rearguard\r\nof the infantry; it was followed by Bock’s dragoons, Anson and Julian\r\nSanchez bringing up the rear. On the night of the 22nd the army\r\nbivouacked along the road about Celada, Villapequeña, and Hornillos;\r\nthe light cavalry, far behind, were still observing the passages of the\r\nArlanzon at Buniel and of the Urbel at Tardajos.\r\n\r\nThe French pursuit was not urged with any vigour on this day. The\r\ndeparture of Wellington had only been discovered in the early morning\r\nhours by the dying down of the camp fires along his old position[86].\r\nAt dawn Souham advanced with caution; finding nothing in front of it,\r\nhis vanguard under Maucune entered Burgos about 10 o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and exchanged congratulations with Dubreton and his gallant\r\ngarrison. The light cavalry of the Army of Portugal pushed out along\r\nthe roads north and south of the Arlanzon: those on the right bank\r\nfound the three broken 18-pounders of Wellington’s battering train\r\na few miles outside of Burgos, and went as far as the Urbel, where\r\nthey came on the rear vedettes of the Allies. Those on the left bank\r\nobtained touch with Anson’s outlying picquet at San Mames, and drove it\r\nback to the Buniel bridge.\r\n\r\nThe 23rd October, however, was to be a day of a much more lively\r\nsort. Souham and Caffarelli, having debouched from Burgos, brought\r\nall their numerous cavalry to the front, and at dawn it was coming up\r\nfor the pursuit, in immense strength. There were present of the Army\r\nof Portugal Curto’s light horse, Boyer’s dragoons, and the brigade\r\nformerly commanded by Chauvel now under Colonel Merlin of the 1st\r\nHussars. These, by the morning state of October 15th, made up 4,300\r\nsabres. The Army of the North contributed the bulk of its one--but\r\nvery powerful--cavalry brigade, that of Laferrière, 1,650 strong.[87]\r\nThus there were nearly 6,000 veteran horsemen hurrying on to molest\r\nWellington’s rear, where the covering force only consisted of Anson’s\r\nand Bock’s two brigades and of the lancers of Julian Sanchez--1,300\r\ndragoons British and German[88], and 1,000 Spaniards admirable for\r\nraids and ambushes but not fit to be placed in battle line. Ponsonby’s\r\ndragoons and the regular squadrons of the Galician army were far away\r\nwith the head of the column. To support the cavalry screen were the\r\ntwo horse-artillery batteries of Downman and Bull, and the two Light\r\nBattalions of the German Legion from the 7th Division, under Colonel\r\nHalkett, which were left behind as the extreme rearguard of the\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nAll day the main marching column of the allied army laboured forward\r\nunmolested along the muddy high road from Celada del Camino to\r\nTorquemada, a very long stage of some 26 miles: Wellington seldom\r\nasked his infantry to make such an effort. What would have happened to\r\nClausel’s army if the British had marched at this rate in the week\r\nthat followed the battle of Salamanca? Behind the infantry column,\r\nhowever, the squadrons of the rearguard were fighting hard all day\r\nlong, to secure an unmolested retreat for their comrades. This was the\r\nmost harassing and one of the most costly efforts that the British\r\ncavalry was called upon to make during the Peninsular War. The nearest\r\nparallel to it in earlier years was the rearguard action of El Bodon in\r\nSeptember 1811[89]. But there the forces engaged on both sides had been\r\nmuch smaller.\r\n\r\nThe French advanced guard consisted of Curto’s light cavalry division\r\nof the Army of Portugal, supported by Maucune’s infantry division. It\r\nhad started at dawn, and found the British cavalry vedettes where they\r\nhad been marked down on the preceding night, at the bridge of Villa\r\nBuniel. They retired without giving trouble, being in no strength,\r\nand the morning was wearing on when the French came upon Wellington’s\r\nrearguard, the horsemen of Anson and Julian Sanchez, and Halkett’s two\r\nGerman battalions, a mile or two east of Celada, holding the line of\r\nthe Hormaza stream. Anson was in position behind its ravine, with a\r\nbattalion of the light infantry dispersed along the bushes above the\r\nwater, and the cavalry in support. Julian Sanchez was visible on the\r\nother side of the Arlanzon, which is not here fordable, beyond Anson’s\r\nright: on his left, hovering on hills above the road, was a small\r\nirregular force, the guerrilla band of Marquinez[90]. The ground along\r\nthe Hormaza was strong, and the infantry fire surprised the enemy,\r\nwho were stopped for some time. They came on presently in force, and\r\nengaged in a bickering fight: several attempts to cross the ravine were\r\nfoiled by partial charges of some of Anson’s squadrons. Wellington\r\nsays in his dispatch that the skirmishing lasted nearly three hours,\r\nand that Stapleton Cotton, who had recently come up from the Salamanca\r\nhospital cured of his wound, made excellent dispositions. But the\r\nodds--more than two to one--were far too great to permit the contest\r\nto be maintained for an indefinite period; and when, after much\r\nbickering, the French (O’Shee’s brigade of Curto’s division) at last\r\nsucceeded in gaining a footing beyond the Hormaza, Anson’s squadrons\r\nwent off in good order. The ground for the next five or six miles was\r\nvery unfavourable for a small detaining force, as the valley of the\r\nArlanzon widened out for a time, and allowed the enemy space to deploy\r\nhis superior numbers. Nevertheless the light dragoons turned again and\r\nagain, and charged with more or less success the pursuing Chasseurs.\r\nWhile Curto’s division was pressing back the British brigade in front,\r\nMerlin’s brigade, pushing out on the French right, ascended the hills\r\nbeyond Anson’s left flank, and there found and drove off the partida of\r\nMarquinez. The fugitive guerrilleros, falling back for support towards\r\nthe British, came in upon the flank of the 16th Light Dragoons with\r\nFrench hussars in close pursuit, and mixed with them. The left squadron\r\nof the 16th was thrown into confusion, and suffered heavily, having\r\nsome thirty casualties; and the commander of the regiment, Colonel\r\nPelly, and seven of his men were taken prisoners. As Curto was pushing\r\non at the same time, Anson’s brigade was much troubled, and was greatly\r\nrelieved when it at last came in sight of its support, Bock’s German\r\nHeavy Dragoons and Bull’s battery, posted behind a bridge spanning a\r\nwatercourse near the lonely house called the Venta del Pozo. The two\r\nbattalions of Halkett, who had been retiring under cover of Anson’s\r\nstubborn resistance, were now some little way behind Bock, near the\r\nvillage of Villadrigo. On seeing the obstacle of the watercourse in\r\nfront of them, and the British reserves behind it, the cavalry of the\r\nArmy of Portugal halted, and began to re-form. Anson’s harassed brigade\r\nwas permitted to cross the bridge and to join Bock.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there came on the scene the French cavalry reserves,\r\nBoyer’s dragoons and the three regiments of the Army of the North,\r\nwhich were commanded that day not by their brigadier Laferrière (who\r\nhad been injured by a fall from his horse) but by Colonel Faverot of\r\nthe 15th Chasseurs. Souham, who had arrived in their company as had\r\nCaffarelli also, gave orders that the pursuit was not to slacken for\r\na minute. While the cavalry of Curto and Merlin were re-forming and\r\nresting, the newly arrived squadrons were directed to drive in the\r\nBritish rearguard from its new position. The brigade of Faverot was to\r\nattack in front, the dragoons of Boyer were to turn the hostile line,\r\nby crossing the watercourse some way to their right, and to fall on\r\nits flank and rear. So great was the superiority in numbers of the\r\nattacking party that they came on with supreme confidence, ignoring\r\nall disadvantages of ground. Faverot’s brigade undertook to pass the\r\nbridge in column, in face of Bock’s two regiments drawn up at the head\r\nof the slope, and of Bull’s battery placed on the high road so as to\r\ncommand the crossing. Boyer’s dragoons trotted off to the right, to\r\nlook for the first available place where the water should allow them a\r\npracticable ford.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was not in accordance with the designs of either party.\r\nSouham had intended Boyer and Faverot to act simultaneously; but the\r\nformer found the obstacle less and less inviting the farther that he\r\nwent on: he rode for more than a mile without discovering a passage,\r\nand finally got out of sight of Souham and the high road[91]. Meanwhile\r\nFaverot had advanced straight for the bridge, and had begun to cross\r\nit. Of his three regiments the Berg lancers led, the 15th Chasseurs\r\ncame next, the Legion of Gendarmerie brought up the rear. They were ten\r\nsquadrons in all, or some 1,200 sabres. As each squadron got quit of\r\nthe bridge it formed up in line, the first to pass to the right of the\r\nroad, while those which followed successively took ground to the left,\r\nbetween the chaussée and the bank of the Arlanzon. Eight squadrons had\r\ngot into position before the British line gave any signs of movement on\r\nthe hillside above.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that to cross a bridge in this fashion was a reckless\r\nmanœuvre. If Bock had charged when two or three squadrons only had\r\npassed[92], he must have crushed them in the act of deployment, and\r\nhave jammed the rest of the French column at the bridgehead in a\r\nposition of helpless immobility. That no such charge was made resulted\r\nfrom a curious chance. Stapleton Cotton, who was still conducting the\r\nretreat, had placed Bull’s battery at a point on the slope where he\r\njudged that it fully commanded the bridge, with Bock’s four squadrons\r\non its right. Then Anson’s brigade, not in the best of order after\r\nits long pursuit by the enemy, trotted over the bridge and came up\r\nthe slope. Cotton intended that it should deploy on the left of the\r\nguns, but the retreating regiments, before the directions reached\r\nthem, turned to the right and began to form up behind Bock’s line. The\r\ngeneral at once sent them orders to cross to the left and prolong the\r\nline on the other side of Bull’s battery. By some extraordinary blunder\r\nthe leading regiment (perhaps to shorten its route) passed to the\r\nleft in front of the guns, instead of moving behind them. It was thus\r\nmasking the battery just at the moment that the French, to the surprise\r\nof every one, began to cross the bridge. There was considerable\r\nconfusion in changing the march of the light dragoons, and before they\r\nwere cleared off and the front of the battery was free, several French\r\nsquadrons were across the ravine and forming up. The artillerymen then\r\nopened, but in their hurry they misjudged the elevation, and not one\r\nshot of the first discharge told. The second did hardly better; more\r\nFrench were passing every moment, and Cotton then directed the cavalry\r\nto charge, since the enemy was becoming stronger and stronger on the\r\nnear side of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe charge was delivered in échelon of brigades; Bock’s two regiments,\r\nwho had been awaiting orders for some time, got away at once, and fell\r\nupon the left of the French--the gendarmes and the left squadrons\r\nof the Chasseurs. Anson’s six squadrons started somewhat later, and\r\nhaving tired horses--after their long morning’s fight--came on at a\r\nmuch slower pace. They found themselves opposed to the Lancers and the\r\nright squadrons of the Chasseurs. There was such a perceptible space\r\nbetween the two attacks, that some of the French narratives speak of\r\nthe British charge as being made by a front line and a reserve. The\r\nnumbers engaged were not very unequal[93]--probably 1,200 French to\r\n1,000 British--but the former were all fresh, while the larger half of\r\nthe latter (Anson’s brigade) were wearied out--man and horse--by long\r\nprevious fighting.\r\n\r\nAll accounts--English and French--agree that this was one of the most\r\nfurious cavalry mêlées ever seen: the two sides broke each other’s\r\nlines at various points--the 1st K.G.L. Dragoons rode down their\r\nimmediate opponents, the 2nd got to a standing fight with theirs:\r\nAnson’s regiments, coming on more slowly on their jaded mounts, made no\r\nimpression on the Lancers and Chasseurs opposite them. The whole mass\r\nfell into a heaving crowd ‘so completely mixed that friend could hardly\r\nbe distinguished from foe--the contest man to man lasted probably a\r\nlong minute, during which the ground was strewn with French, and our\r\nown loss was heavy in the extreme.’ General Bock was at one time seen\r\ndefending himself against six Frenchmen, and was barely saved by his\r\nmen. Beteille, the Colonel of the French Gendarme Legion, received, it\r\nis said, twelve separate wounds, and was left for dead. The combat was\r\nended by the intervention of the two rear squadrons of the Gendarmes,\r\nwho had not crossed the bridge when the charge began; they came up\r\nlate, and fell upon the flank and rear of the 2nd Dragoons of the\r\nK.G.L. This last push settled the matter, and the British brigades\r\nbroke and fell back[94].\r\n\r\nThey were not so disheartened, however, but that they rallied half a\r\nmile to the rear, and were showing fight when Boyer’s dragoons came\r\ntardily upon the scene--they had at last found a passage over the\r\nravine, and appeared in full strength on the flank. It was hopeless\r\nto oppose them, and the wrecks of the two British brigades fell back\r\nhastily towards their infantry support, Halkett’s two Light Battalions\r\nof the German Legion, which had been retreating meanwhile towards\r\nVilladrigo, marching in column at quarter distance and prepared to\r\nform square when necessary. The need now came--the leading regiment of\r\nBoyer’s Dragoons turned upon the rear battalion--the 1st--and charged\r\nit: the square was formed in good time, and the attack was beaten off.\r\nThe battalion then retired, falling back upon the 2nd, which had\r\nnearly reached Villadrigo. Both then retreated together, covering the\r\nbroken cavalry, and had gone a short distance farther when the French\r\nrenewed the attack. Both battalions formed square, both were charged,\r\nand both repulsed the attack of the dragoons with loss. The enemy,\r\nwho had still plenty of intact squadrons, seemed to be contemplating\r\na third charge, but hesitated, and finally Bock’s and Anson’s men\r\nhaving got back into some sort of order, and showing a front once more,\r\nthe squares retired unmolested, and marched off in company with the\r\ncavalry. The French followed cautiously and gave no further trouble. It\r\nwas now dark, and when the pursuit ceased the rearguard halted for two\r\nhours, and resuming its march about ten o’clock, finally reached the\r\nbridge of Quintana del Puente, outside Torquemada, at two o’clock next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThus ended a costly affair, which might have proved much more perilous\r\nhad the French been better managed. But though their troopers fought\r\nwell enough, their generals failed to get such advantage as they\r\nshould out of their superior numbers. It is to be noted that both\r\nCurto and Boyer have very poor records in the memoirs of Marmont, Foy,\r\nand other contemporary writers, who speak on other occasions of the\r\n‘inertie coupable’ and ‘faute de décision’ of the one, and call the\r\nother ‘bon manœuvrier, mais n’ayant pas la réputation qui attire la\r\nconfiance aveugle du soldat’: Napoleon once summed them up as ‘mauvais\r\nou médiocres[95], along with several other generals. It seems clear,\r\nat any rate, that they should have accomplished more, with the means\r\nat their disposal. The damage inflicted on the British rearguard was\r\nmuch smaller than might have been expected--only 230 in all, including\r\n5 officers and 60 men taken prisoners[96]. It is probable indeed that\r\nthe pursuers suffered no less; for, though their official report spoke\r\nof no more than about a hundred and fifty casualties, Faverot’s Brigade\r\nalone had almost as many by itself, showing a list of 7 killed and 18\r\nofficers and 116 men wounded. But the regimental lists give 35 French\r\ncavalry officers in all disabled that day, 5 in Curto’s division, 5 in\r\nMerlin’s Brigade, 5 in Boyer’s Dragoons, and 2 on the staff, beside\r\nthe 18 in Faverot’s Brigade. This must indicate a total loss of nearly\r\n300, applying the very moderate percentage of casualties of men to\r\nofficers that prevailed in Faverot’s regiments to the other corps.\r\nThe engagement had been most honourable to the two cavalry brigades\r\nof Wellington’s rearguard, and not less so to the German Legion light\r\ninfantry. An intelligent observer--not a soldier--who saw the whole of\r\nthe fighting that day remarked, ‘I twice thought Anson’s Brigade (which\r\nwas weak in numbers and much exhausted by constant service) would have\r\nbeen annihilated; and I believe we owe the preservation of that and of\r\nthe heavy German brigade to the admirable steadiness of Halkett’s two\r\nLight Battalions.... We literally had to fight our way for four miles,\r\nretiring, halting, charging, and again retiring. I say _we_ because I\r\nwas in the thick of it, and never witnessed such a scene of anxiety,\r\nuproar, and confusion. Throughout the whole of this trying occasion\r\nStapleton Cotton behaved with great coolness, judgement, and gallantry.\r\nI was close to him the whole time, and did not observe him for an\r\ninstant disturbed or confused[97].’ At the end of the fight one officer\r\nin a jaded regiment observed to another that it had been a bad day. His\r\nfriend replied that it had been a most honourable day for the troops,\r\nfor at nightfall every unwounded man on an efficient horse was still in\r\nline and ready to charge again. There had been no rout, no straggling,\r\nand no loss of morale.\r\n\r\nWhile the combat of Venta del Pozo was in progress the main body of\r\nthe army had been resting in and about Torquemada, undisturbed by\r\nany pursuit, so well had the rearguard played its part. Next morning\r\n(October 24th) it marched off and crossed the Carrion river by the\r\nbridges of Palencia, Villamuriel, and Dueñas. Behind this stream\r\nWellington was proposing to check the enemy for at least some days.\r\nHe chose it, rather than the Pisuerga, as his defensive line for\r\ntactical reasons. If he had stayed behind the Pisuerga, he would have\r\nhad the Carrion and its bridges in his immediate rear, and he was\r\ndetermined not to fight with bridge-defiles behind him. In the rear\r\nof the Carrion there were no such dangerous passages, and the way was\r\nclear to Valladolid. It was fortunate that, after the lively day on the\r\n23rd, the French made no serious attempt at pursuit upon the 24th, for\r\nthere were many stragglers that morning from the infantry. Torquemada\r\nwas the centre of a wine-district and full of barrels, vats, and even\r\ncisterns of the heady new vintage of 1812; many of the men had repaid\r\nthemselves for a twenty-six mile march by over-deep potations, and it\r\nwas very hard to get the battalions started next morning.[98] Napier\r\nsays that ‘twelve thousand men at one time were in a state of helpless\r\ninebriety:’ this is no doubt an exaggeration, but the diaries of\r\neye-witnesses make it clear that there was much drunkenness that day.\r\n\r\nWellington’s new position extended from Palencia on the Carrion to\r\nDueñas on the Pisuerga, below its junction with the first-named river.\r\nHe intended to have all the bridges destroyed, viz. those of Palencia,\r\nVilla Muriel, and San Isidro on the Carrion, and those of Dueñas and\r\nTariego on the Pisuerga. He placed one of the Galician divisions\r\n(Cabrera’s) in Palencia and south of it, supported by the 3/1st from\r\nthe 5th Division. Another Galician division (Losada’s) continued the\r\nline southward to Villa Muriel, where it was taken up by the 5th\r\nDivision--now under General Oswald who had recently joined. The 1st,\r\n6th, and 7th Divisions prolonged the line down the Pisuerga. Behind\r\nthe rivers, all the way, there was a second line of defence, formed by\r\nthe dry bed of the Canal of Castile, which runs for many miles through\r\nthe valley: it was out of order and waterless, but the depression of\r\nits course made a deep trench running parallel with the Carrion and\r\nPisuerga, and very tenable. It must be noted that Palencia lay to\r\nthe wrong side of the Carrion for Wellington’s purpose, being on its\r\nleft or eastern bank. It had, therefore, either to be held as a sort\r\nof _tête de pont_, or evacuated before the enemy should attack. The\r\nSpanish officer in command resolved to take the former course, though\r\nthe town was indefensible, with a ruinous mediaeval wall: he occupied\r\nit, and made arrangements for the blowing up of the bridge only when\r\nhis advanced guard should have been driven out of Palencia and should\r\nhave recrossed the river.\r\n\r\nSouham, who had pushed his head-quarters forward to Magaz this day,\r\nresolved to try to force the line of the Carrion. Two divisions under\r\nFoy--his own and that of Bonté (late Thomières)--were to endeavour to\r\ncarry Palencia and its bridge. Maucune, with the old advanced guard,\r\nhis own division and that of Gauthier[99], was to see if anything\r\ncould be done at the bridges of Villa Muriel and San Isidro. Foy had\r\nLaferrière’s cavalry brigade given him, Maucune retained Curto’s light\r\nhorse. The main body of the army remained in a mass near Magaz, ready\r\nto support either of the advanced columns, if it should succeed in\r\nforcing a passage.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Wellington, everything went wrong at Palencia. Foy,\r\nmarching rapidly on the city, drove away the few squadrons of Galician\r\ncavalry which were observing his front, and then burst open one of\r\nits rickety gates with artillery fire, and stormed the entry with\r\nChemineau’s brigade. The Galician battalions in the town, beaten in\r\na short street fight, were evicted with such a furious rush that the\r\nBritish engineer officer with the party of the 3/1st, who were working\r\nat the bridge, failed[100] to fire the mine, whose fuse went wrong.\r\nMost of them were taken prisoners. Colonel Campbell of the 3/1st, who\r\nhad been sent to support the Spaniards, fell back towards Villa Muriel,\r\njudging the enemy too strong to be resisted, and the routed Galicians\r\nhad to be covered by Ponsonby’s heavy dragoons from the pursuit of the\r\nFrench cavalry, who spread over the environs of Palencia and captured\r\nsome baggage trains, British and Spanish, with their escorts.\r\n\r\nThus Souham had secured a safe passage over the Carrion and it\r\nmattered little to him that his other attack farther south had less\r\ndecisive success. Here Maucune, always a very enterprising--not to say\r\nreckless--commander had marched against the two bridges of Villa Muriel\r\nand San Isidro. He led his own division towards the former, and sent\r\nthat of Gauthier against the latter. The 5th Division had an infantry\r\nscreen of light troops beyond the river--this was pushed in, with some\r\nloss, especially to the 8th Caçadores. Both bridges were then attacked,\r\nbut each was blown up when the heads of the French columns approached,\r\nand a heavy fire, both of artillery and of musketry, from the other\r\nbank checked their further advance. Gauthier then turned east in search\r\nof a passage, and went coasting along the bank of the Pisuerga for\r\nsome miles, as far as the bridge of Tariego (or Baños, as the British\r\naccounts call it). This had been prepared for destruction like the\r\nother bridges, but the mine when exploded only broke the parapets and\r\npart of the flooring. The French charged across, on the uninjured crown\r\nof the arch, and captured some 40 of the working party[101]: they\r\nestablished themselves on the opposite bank, but advanced no farther;\r\nhere the British had still the lower course of the Pisuerga to protect\r\nthem, while Gauthier had no supports near, and halted, content to have\r\ncaptured the bridge, which he began to repair.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the bridge of Villa Muriel having been more efficiently\r\nblown up, Maucune dispersed his voltigeur companies along the\r\nriver-bank, brought his artillery up to a favourable position, and\r\nentered on a long desultory skirmish with Oswald, which lasted for\r\nsome hours. During this time he was searching for fords--several were\r\nfound[102], but all were deep and dangerous. About three o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon a squadron of cavalry forded one of them, apparently\r\nunobserved, reached the western bank, and rolled up a company of\r\nthe 1/9th which it caught strung out along the river bickering with\r\nthe skirmishers on the other side. An officer and 33 men were taken\r\nprisoners[103]. This passage was followed by that of eight voltigeur\r\ncompanies, who established themselves on the other side, but clung to\r\nthe bank of the river, the British light troops having only retired\r\na few score of yards from it. Having thus got a lodgement beyond\r\nthe Carrion, Maucune resolved to cross in force, in support of his\r\nvoltigeurs. Arnauld’s brigade passed at the ford which had first been\r\nused, Montfort’s at another, to the left of the broken bridge, farther\r\ndown the stream. The French seized the village of Villa Muriel, and\r\nestablished themselves in force along the dry bed of the canal, a\r\nlittle to its front. Wellington had expected that Maucune would come on\r\nfarther, and intended to charge him with the whole 5th Division when\r\nhe should begin to ascend the slope above the canal. But when, after\r\nan hour or more, the enemy made no advance, it became necessary to\r\nassume the offensive against him, since Foy was now across the Carrion\r\nat Palencia, and, if he commenced to push forward, he might drive the\r\nSpanish troops between him and Villa Muriel into Maucune’s arms. The\r\nlatter must be expelled before this danger should arise: wherefore at\r\nabout 4 o’clock a brigade of Losada’s Spaniards was sent against the\r\nright of the French division, while Pringle’s brigade attacked its\r\nfront along the bed of the canal. The Spaniards made no progress--they\r\nwere indeed driven back, and rallied with difficulty by Wellington’s\r\nfriend General Alava, who was severely wounded. To replace them the\r\nBritish brigade of Barnes was brought up, and told to storm Villa\r\nMuriel--Spry’s Portuguese supporting. After a stiff fight Pringle and\r\nBarnes swept all before them: the enemy yielded first on the right,\r\nbut held out for some time in the village, where he lost a certain\r\nnumber of prisoners. He finally repassed the fords, and sought safety\r\nin the plain on the eastern bank, where the French reserves were now\r\nbeginning to appear in immense force. ‘Their numbers were so great that\r\nthe fields appeared to our view almost black[104].’ Wellington wrote\r\nhome that he had hitherto under-estimated Souham’s force, and only now\r\nrealized that the Army of the North had brought up its infantry as well\r\nas its cavalry. He, naturally, made no attempt to pursue the enemy\r\nbeyond the Carrion, and the fight died down into a distant cannonade\r\nacross the water[105].\r\n\r\nThe combat of Villa Muriel cost the 5th Division some 500\r\ncasualties--not including 43 men of the 3/1st, hurt or taken in\r\nthe separate fight at Palencia, or a few casualties in Ponsonby’s\r\ndragoons in that same quarter. Maucune’s losses were probably not\r\nfar different--they must certainly have exceeded the ‘250 killed or\r\nwounded, 30 prisoners and 6 drowned’ of the official report: for\r\none of Maucune’s regiments--the 15th Line--had 200 casualties by\r\nitself[106]. Foy at Palencia lost very few men--though his statement of\r\n‘three or four’ as their total can hardly be correct. He had taken 100\r\nprisoners (27 of them British), and killed or wounded 60 more, mostly\r\nGalicians[107]. The balance of the day’s losses was certainly against\r\nthe Allies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, despite of Maucune’s repulse, the result of the day’s\r\nfighting was much to Wellington’s detriment, since (though the loss of\r\nthe bridge of Tariego mattered little) the capture of Palencia ruined\r\nhis scheme for defending the line of the Carrion. Souham’s whole army\r\ncould follow Foy, and turn the left flank of the Allies behind that\r\nriver. Wherefore Wellington first threw back the left flank of the 5th\r\nDivision _en potence_, to make a containing line against Foy, while\r\nits right flank still held the line of the river about Villa Muriel.\r\nUnder cover of this rearguard, the remainder of the army evacuated\r\nits positions on each side of Dueñas at dawn on the 26th, and marched\r\ndown the Pisuerga to Cabezon, where it passed the river at the bridge\r\nof that place and retired to the opposite side. The 5th Division\r\nfollowed (unmolested by the enemy) in the early morning: at night\r\nthe entire allied army had retired across the broad stream, and was\r\nlining its left bank from Valladolid upward, with that city (held by\r\nthe 7th Division) as the supporting point of its southern flank, and\r\nits northern resting on the Cubillas river. This was one of the most\r\nsurprising and ingenious movements that Wellington ever carried out.\r\nOn the 23rd he was defending the right bank of the Pisuerga--on the\r\n24th he was on the other side and defending its left bank in a much\r\nstronger position. He was in no way sacrificing his communications\r\nwith Portugal or Madrid, since he had behind him two good bridges over\r\nthe Douro, those of Tudela and Puente Duero, with excellent roads\r\nsouthward and westward to Medina del Campo, Arevalo, and Olmedo. The\r\nenemy might refuse to attack him, and march down the west bank of the\r\nPisuerga towards the Douro, but Wellington had already provided for\r\nthe destruction of the three bridges of Simancas, Tordesillas, and\r\nToro, and the Douro was now a very fierce and broad barrier to further\r\nprogress, twice as difficult to cross as the Pisuerga. On the other\r\nhand, if Souham should make up his mind to come down the Pisuerga on\r\nits eastern bank, by the restored bridge of Tariego, there was an\r\nexcellent fighting position along the Cubillas river. But the roads on\r\nthis side of the Pisuerga were bad, and the country rough, while on the\r\nwestern bank the ground was flat and fertile, and the line of march\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nSouham, therefore, advanced as was natural from Palencia southward, on\r\nthe right bank of the Pisuerga; on the 26th he withdrew Maucune and\r\nGauthier to that side, and on the 27th felt the position of Cabezon,\r\nwhich he decided to be impregnable, and left alone. He placed the\r\ninfantry of the Army of the North opposite it, and moved southward with\r\nthe rest of his forces. On the 28th he tried the passage of Valladolid,\r\nafter driving out a battalion of Portuguese caçadores from the suburb\r\nbeyond the Pisuerga, and cannonading the 51st across the bridge. Here\r\ntoo the obstacles looked most formidable, and the French, pursuing\r\ntheir march, came to the bridge of Simancas, which was blown up in\r\ntheir faces by Colonel Halkett, whose brigade of the 7th Division had\r\nbeen placed in this part of the British line. Halkett then sent on one\r\nof his three battalions (the Brunswick-Oels) to Tordesillas.\r\n\r\nThis was all quite satisfactory to Wellington, who had been able to\r\ngive his troops two days’ rest, and who saw that the enemy, despite of\r\nhis superior numbers, seemed to be brought to a nonplus by the position\r\nbehind the Pisuerga. But the next evening (October 29) brought very\r\nuntoward news. Foy’s division now formed the advance-guard of the Army\r\nof Portugal: it reached and occupied Tordesillas, where the bridge\r\n(like that of Simancas) had its main arch destroyed. A mediaeval tower\r\non the south bank of the ruined structure was held by a half-company\r\nof the Brunswick-Oels infantry as an outlying picquet: the rest of\r\nthe battalion was encamped in a wood some hundreds of yards behind.\r\nConsidering that the river was broad and swift, and that all boats\r\nhad been carefully destroyed, it was considered that the passage\r\nwas impossible. Foy thought, however, that it was worth making the\r\nhazardous attempt to cross: he called for volunteers, and collected\r\n11 officers and 44 men, who undertook to attempt to ford the Douro\r\nby swimming and wading. Their leader was Captain Guingret of the 6th\r\nLéger, one of the minor historians of the war. They placed their\r\nmuskets and ammunition on a sort of raft formed of planks hastily\r\njoined, which certain good swimmers undertook to tow and guide. At 4\r\no’clock in the afternoon the 55 adventurers pushed off the raft, and\r\nplunged into the water, striking out in a diagonal direction. Meanwhile\r\nFoy brought down his divisional battery to the shore, and began\r\nshelling the tower at the bridge-end. The starting-point had been well\r\nchosen, and the raft and swimmers were borne across the stream with\r\nsurprising speed, and came ashore a few yards from the tower, which,\r\nall naked and with arms many of which had been soaked in the water and\r\nwould not fire, they proceeded to attack. The lieutenant in charge\r\nof the Brunswick picquet and his men lost their heads in the most\r\ndisgraceful fashion; perhaps they were demoralized by the artillery\r\nplaying on them--at any rate, after firing some ill-directed shots,\r\nthey ran off--two were captured in the tower, nine others outside it.\r\nThe swimmers, now shivering with cold, for the afternoon was bleak,\r\ntook possession of the bridgehead, and Foy’s sappers at the other\r\nend of the broken arch began to hurry forward ropes to establish a\r\ncommunication with the captured tower[108].\r\n\r\nThe major in command of the Brunswick battalion, half a mile off,\r\nbehaved as badly as the subaltern at the tower. He should have come\r\ndown in force and thrown the handful of naked men into the river.\r\nInstead of doing so he put his corps under arms in the edge of the\r\nwood, and sent information to his brigadier asking for orders. By the\r\ntime that Halkett heard of the matter, a rough communication had been\r\nmade across the shattered bridge, and the French were streaming over.\r\nNothing was done, save to move reinforcements from the 7th Division to\r\nblock the two roads that diverge from the bridgehead south and west.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary feat of Guingret’s party, one of the most dashing\r\nexploits of the Peninsular War, altered Wellington’s position, much\r\nfor the worse. The enemy had now secured a crossing on the Douro\r\nopposite his extreme left wing. He had already begun to move troops\r\nin this direction, when he saw Foy pushing forward past Simancas, and\r\non the morning of the 29th had resolved to leave Valladolid and make\r\na general shift westward, parallel to the enemy. Soon after dawn the\r\nbridge of Cabezon was blown up, and the British right wing retired,\r\nunder cover of the troops still holding Valladolid. When the right\r\nwing (the 5th Division and the Galicians) had passed to the rear of\r\nthat city, and were nearing the Douro bridges (Tudela and Puente de\r\nDuero) behind it, the centre of the British line (1st, 6th, and Pack’s\r\nPortuguese) followed, and finally the left (two brigades of the 7th\r\nDivision) evacuated Valladolid after destroying the Pisuerga bridge,\r\nand passed the Douro in the wake of the centre. All this was done with\r\nno molestation from the enemy, and at nightfall on the 29th every man\r\nwas on the south of the Douro, and its bridges had been blown up after\r\nthe rearguards had passed.\r\n\r\nWellington had been intending to hold the line of that great river\r\ntill he should have certain news of how Hill--of whose operations the\r\nnext chapter treats--was faring in the south. Since he knew that the\r\ntroops from Madrid were coming to join him, he had purposed to maintain\r\nhimself behind the Douro till Hill came up to the Adaja. The news of\r\nthe passage of Foy at Tordesillas was therefore very vexatious; but\r\nhis counter-move was bold and effective. Before the enemy had fully\r\nrepaired the bridge, or got any large force across it, he marched to\r\nRueda with the 1st, 6th, and 7th Divisions, and advanced from thence\r\nto the heights opposite Tordesillas, where he formed line of battle\r\nonly 1,200 yards from the Douro, and threw up a line of redoubts, so\r\nstrong that the enemy dared not push on. The first brigade to move out\r\nfrom the bridge would obviously be destroyed, and there was no room for\r\nlarge forces to deploy and attack. The enemy saw this, and instead of\r\ndebouching constructed a defensive bridgehead at Tordesillas[109].\r\n\r\nSouham indeed, having occupied Valladolid and drawn up to the line\r\nof the Douro, remained quiescent for six days. It looked as if his\r\noffensive movement had come to an end. The main cause of his halt was\r\nthat Caffarelli, having assisted him in driving Wellington back to the\r\nDouro, refused to follow him further, declaring that he must go back\r\nat once to the North, from whence the most unsatisfactory news was\r\nreaching him day by day. Both about Pampeluna, and round Bilbao, which\r\nthe Spaniards had once more seized, things were in a most dangerous\r\ncondition. After barely visiting Valladolid he turned on his heel,\r\nand marching fast was back at Burgos again on November 6th[110].\r\nDeprived of the strong cavalry brigade and the two infantry divisions\r\nof the Army of the North, Souham was no longer in a condition to press\r\nWellington recklessly. He had now well under 40,000 men, instead of\r\nnearly 50,000, with which to assail the Allies in their new and strong\r\nposition. Wherefore, he resolved to wait till he had news that Soult\r\nand King Joseph were drawing near from the South. The King’s dispatches\r\nhad told him to avoid a general action, and to wait for the effect of\r\nthe great diversion that would soon be developing against Wellington’s\r\nrear. Hence, mainly, came the halt, which caused his adversary to think\r\nfor some days that he might be able to draw at the line of the Douro\r\nthe limit of the French advance.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the retreat from Burgos was now at an end. To\r\nunderstand the manœuvres of the second half, we must first explain the\r\ndoings of Soult, King Joseph, and General Hill in New Castile during\r\nthe last week of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHILL’S RETREAT FROM MADRID\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crisis in front of Madrid, where Hill stood exposed to attack from\r\nthe mass of French forces in the kingdom of Valencia, developed late.\r\nWe have already seen that the first dispatch from the South which\r\ndisquieted Wellington only reached him on the 19th October, and that it\r\nwas not till the 21st that he realized that all his plans for hindering\r\na French advance on Madrid were ineffective, and that Hill was in\r\nserious danger.\r\n\r\nThe long delay in Soult’s evacuation of Andalusia was--as has been\r\nalready remarked--the ultimate cause of the late appearance of the\r\nadvancing columns of the enemy in front of Madrid. It was not till\r\nSeptember 30 that the advanced cavalry of the Army of the South got\r\ninto touch with the outlying vedettes of Treillard’s dragoons, at\r\nTobarra near Hellin. Four days later Soult was in conference with King\r\nJoseph, and the Marshals Jourdan and Suchet who had come out to meet\r\nhim, at Fuente la Higuera, some fifty miles farther on the road toward\r\nValencia. They met with various designs, though all were agreed that\r\nthe Allies must be driven out of the capital as soon as possible.\r\nSuchet was mainly anxious to get the Army of the South, and the King\r\nalso, out of his own viceroyalty. Joseph’s troops were wasting his\r\nstores, and harrying the peasantry, whose shearing he wished to reserve\r\nfor himself. Soult’s men were notoriously unruly, and at the present\r\nmoment half famished, after their long march through a barren land. The\r\nDuke of Albufera was anxious to see them all started off for Madrid\r\nat the earliest possible moment. His only personal demand was that he\r\nshould be allowed to borrow a division from one or the other army;\r\nfor, when they should be gone, he thought that he would have barely\r\nenough men to hold off Mackenzie and the Spaniards of the Murcian\r\narmy. He promised, and produced, large convoys of food for the service\r\nof the Armies of the South and Centre, but pleaded that in order to\r\nmake his only base and arsenal--the city of Valencia--quite safe,\r\nit was necessary that they should leave him 5,000 extra troops: in\r\nespecial he pleaded for Palombini’s division, which had originally been\r\nborrowed from his own army of Aragon. Jourdan--as he tells us in his\r\nmemoirs[111]--maintained that it was necessary to turn every possible\r\nman upon Madrid, and that Suchet could defend himself against his old\r\nenemies with his own army alone. He might, if hard pressed, call down\r\nsome troops from Catalonia.\r\n\r\nBut the real quarrel was between Soult and King Joseph. The first\r\nwas in a sullen and captious mood, because the King had caused him\r\nto evacuate his much-prized viceroyalty in Andalusia, by refusing to\r\njoin him there in September. But Joseph was at a much higher pitch of\r\npassion; not only did he still remember all Soult’s disobedience in\r\nJuly and August, which (as he thought) had led to the unnecessary loss\r\nof Madrid, but he had a new and a much more bitter grievance. Some time\r\nbefore the Army of the South reached Valencia, he had become possessed\r\nof the dispatch to the minister of war which Soult had written on\r\nAugust 12th, in which he hinted that the King was meditating treachery\r\nto his brother the Emperor, and had opened up negotiations with the\r\nCortes in order to betray the French cause[112]. This document--as has\r\nbeen explained above--had been given by Soult to a privateer captain\r\nbound from Malaga to Toulon, who had been forced to run into the\r\nharbour of Valencia by the British blockading squadron. Not knowing the\r\ncontents of the document, the captain had handed it over to the King,\r\nwhen he found him at Valencia. Thus Joseph was aware that the Marshal\r\nhad accused him, on the most flimsy evidence, of betraying his brother.\r\nHe was justly indignant, and had contemplated, in his first outburst\r\nof rage, the arrest and supersession of Soult. His next impulse had\r\nbeen to send off his confidential aide-de-camp Colonel Deprez, to seek\r\nfirst the minister of war at Paris, and then the Emperor himself in\r\nRussia[113], with his petition for vengeance. ‘Je demande justice. Que\r\nle Maréchal Soult soit rappelé, entendu, et puni[114].’ If his enemy\r\nhad appeared at Valencia early in September, he would probably have\r\ntaken the most extreme measures against him. But three weeks had gone\r\nby, his anger had had time to cool, and he could realize the danger\r\nof attempting to seize and deport a marshal whose army was double the\r\nsize of his own and Suchet’s combined, and who had a powerful faction\r\nto support him among his own generals. Joseph hoped that a mandate\r\nfor Soult’s recall and disgrace would soon be on its way from Russia,\r\nand meanwhile curbed his temper, ignored the Marshal’s recent charges\r\nof treachery, and contented himself with treating him with coldness,\r\nand overruling many of his proposals, on the mere formal ground of\r\ndiscipline. He was the commander-in-chief, and could accept or reject\r\nthe suggestions of a subordinate as he pleased. Soult was no longer\r\nthree hundred miles away, as he had been in June, and orders given\r\nby a superior on the spot could be enforced, unless the Marshal were\r\nprepared to break out into open insubordination.\r\n\r\nThere was no difference of opinion as to the necessity for marching on\r\nMadrid. But wrangling arose as to the amount of troops that would be\r\nneeded for the operation. Soult said that every possible man would be\r\nrequired, and wished to march with the entire Army of the South on San\r\nClemente and Ocaña, while he suggested that the King, with the Army\r\nof the Centre and a large detachment taken from Suchet, should move\r\nby Requeña and Cuenca. Suchet protested in the most vigorous fashion\r\nagainst being stripped of any of his divisions, and maintained that it\r\nwas rather necessary that he should be lent 5,000 men from the Armies\r\nof the Centre of the South. The King and Jourdan refused to consider\r\nthe latter proposition, but agreed that Suchet would require all his\r\nown troops, and that none should be taken from him. Yet approving of\r\nthe double movement on Madrid, they declared that the Army of the\r\nCentre was too small to operate by itself, and that Soult should make\r\nover to it Barrois’s division and a brigade of light cavalry, to bring\r\nit up to the necessary strength. Soult protested loudly: the Emperor\r\nhad entrusted the army of the South to him; he was responsible for it;\r\nit was one and indivisible, and so forth[115].\r\n\r\nJoseph then put the matter to him in the form of a simple order to set\r\nthese troops on a certain route on a certain day. The Marshal did not\r\ndare to disobey, but stated that he regarded them as still belonging to\r\nhis army, and should continue to expect reports from their commanders.\r\nThis left him with a force of five infantry and three cavalry\r\ndivisions, disencumbered of his sick, and of 2,000 old, weakly, or\r\ntime-expired men, who marched to Valencia to join the next convoy that\r\nSuchet should send to France. Their total (omitting Barrois and the\r\ncavalry taken off by Joseph) made up 30,000 infantry, 6,000 horse, and\r\nwith engineers, artillery, train, &c., just 40,000 men. The Army of the\r\nCentre on October 15th showed (including Palombini, the King’s Guard\r\nand the Spaniards) about 15,000 present under arms, to which must be\r\nadded Barrois and the two cavalry regiments that accompanied him[116],\r\nmaking 6,000 men between them. Thus the total force with which Joseph\r\nand Soult marched on Madrid was over 60,000 men[117].\r\n\r\nThe object of dividing the advancing army into two columns was not\r\nmerely to make it more easy for the troops to find food in a desolate\r\ncountry, but much more to carry out a strategical plan. If the whole\r\narmy had moved by the high road through La Mancha, it would have had\r\nno power to communicate with the Army of Portugal. The King’s idea was\r\nthat the northern column, which marched by Cuenca, and which he himself\r\naccompanied, would ultimately get into touch with Souham, who had been\r\ndirected--by dispatches which reached him too late or not at all--to\r\nfollow Wellington in such a way that he would be able to outflank\r\nhim on the Upper Douro, and open up communications by the route of\r\nAranda, the Somosierra Pass, and Guadalajara, with the main French\r\nArmy. But Souham, when he commenced his advance against Wellington\r\non October 18th, had no order from the King later than a letter of\r\nOctober 1st, written before Soult had arrived in the kingdom of\r\nValencia. He received no more dispatches while engaged in his pursuit\r\nof Wellington, and was unaware of Joseph’s later plans, so that when he\r\nreached Valladolid he made no endeavour to feel to his left, towards\r\nAranda, but rather extended himself to his right, in the direction of\r\nTordesillas and Toro, a movement which took him entirely away from\r\nthe direction in which the King hoped to find him. They did not get\r\ninto touch, or combine their operations in any way, till November\r\nhad arrived. At the same time the advance of a large body of troops\r\nby the route of Cuenca turned out most profitable in the end to the\r\nFrench strategy, for it was precisely this flanking column, of great\r\nbut unknown strength, which compelled Hill to abandon his intention\r\nof defending the lines of the Tagus or the Tajuna. However he might\r\nplace himself opposite Soult’s army coming from the South, he had this\r\nthreatening force beyond his eastern flank, turning his positions by\r\nroads too remote for him to guard.\r\n\r\nKing Joseph had proposed to commence his march upon Madrid at the\r\nearliest possible moment--at the interview with the three marshals\r\nat Fuente la Higuera he had named the 9th October as the date for\r\nstarting. But Soult declared, after a few days, that this was\r\nimpossible, owing to the necessity for collecting the convoys that\r\nSuchet was sending him, replenishing his ammunition, and bringing up\r\nhis rearmost troops. The division of Conroux had picked up the yellow\r\nfever, by plundering out of its route, during the march through Murcia.\r\nIt had been left in quarantine, some days behind the rest of the army,\r\nand would take time to come up. It is probable that Soult was not\r\nreally wasting time of set purpose; but the King was certainly under\r\nthe impression that he was doing so, and their correspondence was most\r\nacrimonious[118]. Special offence was given by Joseph’s withdrawing\r\nDrouet from the Army of the South, and entrusting him with the command\r\nof that of the Centre. But when Soult murmured at this and other\r\nthings, the King sent him a laconic letter of ten lines, telling him\r\nthat if he refused to obey orders he had better resign his command\r\nand go to Paris, where he would have to give account for all his\r\ndoings. The Marshal, as on previous occasions when the question of his\r\nresignation had been pressed home[119], avoided this simple solution of\r\nthe problem, and yielded a grudging obedience in the end.\r\n\r\nSoult’s army was at this time cantoned with its right wing about\r\nAlmanza, Yecla, and Fuente la Higuera, and its left wing--now about to\r\nbecome its advanced guard--in and around the large town of Albacete.\r\nA detachment from this wing had been for the last ten days attacking\r\nthe isolated rock-fortress of Chinchilla, the only inland stronghold\r\nwhich was held by the Spaniards in the kingdom of Murcia. It was a\r\nGothic donjon on an inaccessible cliff, only formidable because of its\r\nposition, and manned by a trifling garrison. It might have held out\r\nindefinitely, having a resolute governor, a certain Colonel Cearra.\r\nBut on October 9th, in a frightful thunderstorm, lightning struck the\r\ndonjon, killed 15 soldiers, wounded many more, set the place on fire,\r\nand disabled the governor[120]. The garrison capitulated in sheer\r\ndismay, and the use by the French of the high road between Albacete\r\nand Almanza was no longer incommoded by the existence of this petty\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nKing Joseph with the Army of the Centre marched out from Valencia\r\non October 17th, and had his head-quarters at Requeña on the road\r\nto Cuenca on the 19th. On the 23rd he reached that ancient and much\r\ndilapidated city, and found it already in the hands of Drouet, who\r\nhad arrived there on the 20th with Barrois’s division and the cavalry\r\nbrigade of Avy from the Army of the South: he had expelled from it\r\nBassecourt’s 3,000 Murcian troops. Soult had started on the 15th from\r\nAlbacete, and had sent off Drouet’s detachment from San Clemente to\r\nCuenca, while he himself marched by Belmonte on Tarancon and Santa\r\nCruz de la Zarza, which he reached on October 25th. He had not got\r\ninto real touch with the enemy till, on the last-named day, the\r\ncavalry on the right of his advance came into contact with Freire’s\r\nMurcian horse in front of Tarancon, and those on his left ran into the\r\nvedettes of Long’s British dragoons in front of Ocaña. During the time\r\nof his advance these troops had been retiring in front of him, from\r\nConsuegra, Toboso, Almonacid, Belmonte, and other places in La Mancha,\r\nwhere they had been providing a long screen of posts to observe his\r\nmovements. They had, by Hill’s orders, retired from the 18th onward\r\nbefore the French cavalry, without allowing themselves to be caught\r\nup. It was only immediately in front of the Tagus that they slackened\r\ndown their pace, and allowed the French to discover them. There was a\r\nsmart skirmish in front of Ocaña on October 25th, between Bonnemain’s\r\nbrigade and the 9th and 13th Light Dragoons and 10th Portuguese\r\ncavalry. The allied squadrons were pushed back towards Aranjuez with\r\nthe loss of some 30 men, Erskine, who was in command of the cavalry\r\ndivision, refusing to make a stand or to bring up his reserves. His\r\nmanagement of the troops was (not for the first time) much criticized\r\nby eye-witnesses[121], but it must be remembered that Hill had directed\r\nhim not to commit himself to a serious action. On the same day Freire’s\r\nhorse were turned out of Tarancon by Perreymond’s chasseurs.\r\n\r\nThe position of the commander of Wellington’s detached corps in front\r\nof Madrid had become a very responsible one between the 15th, when\r\nSoult’s advance began, and the 24th, when the enemy came up to the line\r\nof the Tagus and developed his attack. Fortunately Hill was in close\r\ntouch with his chief: so well was the line of communication between\r\nthem kept up, that it only took two days for a letter from Burgos\r\nto reach Madrid--and vice versa. When the army had come back from\r\nthe Arlanzon to the Douro, the time became even shorter. Wellington\r\nreceived at Cabezon on the evening of October 27th dispatches that Hill\r\nhad written on the morning of the 26th[122]. This contrasts wonderfully\r\nwith the slow travelling of French correspondence--Souham got at\r\nBriviesca on October 17 a letter written by King Joseph at Valencia on\r\nOctober 1st. It had been obliged to travel by the absurdly circuitous\r\nroute of Tortosa, Saragossa and Tudela. Truly the guerrilleros made\r\nconcerted movements of French armies singularly difficult.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th October Hill had already got off his first letter of alarm\r\nto Wellington, saying that Soult was certainly on the move; by the\r\n19th he knew that there was a column moving upon Cuenca, as well as\r\nthe larger force which was advancing by San Clemente and Belmonte. He\r\nasked for orders, but meanwhile had to issue his own, in consonance\r\nwith earlier directions received from Wellington. These presupposed\r\ntwo conditions which had not been realized--that the fords of the\r\nTagus would be impassable, and that Ballasteros’s Andalusian army\r\nwould already have crossed the Sierra Morena to Alcaraz and be lying\r\non Soult’s flank. But their general directions were still practicable:\r\nthe line of the Tagus was to be defended unless the enemy were in\r\noverwhelming strength: if (contrary to Wellington’s expectation) the\r\nwhole French force in Valencia should advance, and its numbers prove\r\ngreater than Hill could hope to check, he had been directed to evacuate\r\nMadrid, and to fall back beyond the Guadarrama, in order to join his\r\nchief on the Adaja, south of Valladolid, in Old Castile[123]. The\r\nfirst thing necessary was to discover the strength of the enemy--all\r\naccounts sent in by the Spaniards agreed that it was very great, and\r\nin particular, that the column going by Cuenca was no mere detachment,\r\nbut a solid and considerable force. Meanwhile Wellington, even as late\r\nas October 12[124], had been informing Hill that his design of marching\r\ndown on Madrid with three divisions, when the siege of Burgos should be\r\neither successfully concluded or else abandoned, was still retained.\r\nAny morning a dispatch might come to say that the commander-in-chief,\r\nwith 15,000 men, was on his way to Valladolid; and therefore the army\r\nin front of Madrid must be ready for him, concentrated and in marching\r\norder. For if he came in person with such a reinforcement, Soult and\r\nKing Joseph could be fought and beaten, whenever they made their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nOn October 15th, when the French advance had actually begun, the\r\nallied troops in New Castile were disposed with an outer screen,\r\nmainly consisting of Spanish troops, and a central nucleus of Hill’s\r\nown Anglo-Portuguese placed in cantonments between Madrid and the\r\nTagus. Bassecourt was at Cuenca with 3,000 men; Elio, with Freire’s\r\nMurcian horse and a weak division of infantry--5,000 men in all--was\r\nwatching the high roads from Albacete and Requeña to Madrid, in front\r\nof Tarancon. Penne Villemur’s cavalry with Morillo’s infantry--3,500\r\nmen at the most--lay across the great chaussée from Andalusia,\r\nabout Herencia and Madridejos[125]. These troops formed the outer\r\nscreen--not taking account of the Empecinado, who was (as usual) on\r\nthe borders of New Castile and Aragon, worrying Suchet’s garrisons in\r\nthe latter kingdom. Behind Penne Villemur, and south of the Tagus,\r\nwere Long’s British and H. Campbell’s Portuguese cavalry brigades,\r\nin La Mancha, at Toboso, Villacanas, and other places. All the rest\r\nof the British troops were north of the Tagus, in the triangle\r\nMadrid-Toledo-Fuentedueñas, as were also D’Urban’s Portuguese horse and\r\nCarlos de España’s Spanish infantry division. When the advance of Soult\r\nand King Joseph developed itself, Hill drew everything back behind\r\nthe Tagus, save Bassecourt’s division at Cuenca, which being evicted\r\nfrom that place by Drouet on the 20th did not retire towards Madrid,\r\nbut went up into the mountains, and ultimately by circuitous routes\r\nrejoined the Alicante army.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th October, when Soult’s advanced cavalry had driven Long and\r\nFreire from Ocaña and Tarancon, Hill had his whole force, British,\r\nPortuguese and Spanish, arrayed in what he intended to be his\r\npreliminary fighting position along the Tagus. The extreme right was\r\nformed by Skerrett’s 4,000 men from Cadiz, who had got up to the front\r\njust in time to take their share in the fighting. They lay at Toledo\r\nand Añover. Then came the four brigades of the British 2nd Division,\r\ntwo of them at Aranjuez--which was held as a sort of _tête de pont_\r\nsouth of the river--and two at Colmenar de Orija. The line beyond them\r\nwas prolonged by Penne Villemur and Morillo about Belmonte de Tajo and\r\nthe fords of Villamanrique. Elio and Freire, who had retired across\r\nthe bridge of Fuentedueñas after being driven out of Tarancon, was\r\nin charge of the upper Tagus from that point to Sacedon. Behind this\r\nfront line lay the reserves--the 3rd and 4th Divisions close together\r\nat Valdemoro and Cienpozuelos, behind Aranjuez; the Light Division at\r\nArganda; Carlos de España at Camporeal; Hamilton’s Portuguese division\r\nat Chinchon. Of the cavalry, Long and Campbell’s Portuguese, after\r\nbeing turned out of Ocaña, had fallen back on Aranjuez: D’Urban’s\r\nPortuguese were at Arganda, Slade’s brigade at Morata, Victor Alten’s\r\nat Getafe[126]. One march would concentrate the whole of the Allies,\r\nhorse and foot--save Elio and Skerrett’s detachment alone--to defend\r\nthe passage of the Tagus at either Aranjuez or Fuentedueñas, the\r\ntwo crossing-places which Hill judged that Soult would take into\r\nconsideration, when he attempted to force the line of the river. About\r\n36,000 men would be available, of whom 28,000 were Anglo-Portuguese and\r\n8,000 Spaniards.\r\n\r\nSoult, however, kept perfectly quiescent in front of Aranjuez and\r\nFuentedueñas on the 26th-27th. He had still his cavalry to the front,\r\nbut his infantry divisions were only coming up in succession: Conroux’s\r\nin especial, being still in quarantine owing to the yellow fever, was\r\nvery far behind. But it was not merely the late arrival of his rear\r\nthat kept Soult motionless: he was waiting for the Cuenca column to\r\nbring pressure to bear upon Hill’s flank, and did not intend to commit\r\nhimself to any important engagements until the whole French army was\r\nin line. He expressed to King Joseph his opinion that the Allies were\r\ndrawn out upon too long a front, and that a bold thrust at Aranjuez\r\nwould probably succeed, when the attention of Hill should be drawn away\r\nto the East by the appearance of the Cuenca column in the direction\r\nof Fuentedueñas. Meanwhile he proceeded to make his preparations for\r\nattacking Aranjuez on the 28th.\r\n\r\nSuch an attack was never delivered, because Hill, on the evening of the\r\n27th, made up his mind that he must not fight upon the Tagus[127]. For\r\nthis determination there were three causes. The first was that the\r\nriver still remained so low, the autumn rains having been very scanty\r\nhitherto, that it was fordable in many places. The mere breaking of\r\nthe bridges at Aranjuez and Fuente Dueñas did not make it impassable,\r\nas Wellington and Hill himself had expected would be the case by the\r\nend of October. Secondly, if the line of the Tagus were forced at any\r\npoint, the troops strung out along it had a very dangerous retreat\r\nbefore them, owing to the fact that the Tajuna, a stream not much\r\nsmaller than the Tagus itself in this part of its course, runs behind\r\nit and parallel to it at a distance of only eight or ten miles. The\r\nnumber of spots where the Tajuna could be crossed, by fords, bridges,\r\nor ferries, were very few, and it was to be feared that bodies of\r\ntroops abandoning positions on the Tagus, and retreating to the next\r\nline, might find themselves pressed against the Tajuna at impassable\r\nsections of its course, and so might be destroyed or captured if the\r\nenemy pursued with vigour. Thirdly--as Soult expected--the movement of\r\nthe King and the column from Cuenca had now begun to exercise pressure\r\non Hill’s mind. He had already moved two British brigades of the 2nd\r\nDivision to Fuente Dueñas, replacing them at Aranjuez by Skerrett’s\r\nforce, which left Toledo. But what if the King should cross the Tagus\r\nnot at Fuente Dueñas but above it, where the river was only observed by\r\nElio’s Murcians? They certainly could not stop him, and the whole Tagus\r\nline would be turned.\r\n\r\nHill’s resolve was now to defend not the Tagus but the line, running\r\nNorth and South, of the Henares and the Jarama (the river formed by\r\nthe union of the Tajuna and Manzanares), from Guadalajara to the\r\npoint near the Puente Larga where the Jarama falls into the Tagus. On\r\nthe 28th Skerrett evacuated Aranjuez, and all the other troops fell\r\nback in similar fashion. This position left the allied army still\r\ncovering Madrid, and with a safe retreat to the passes above it, should\r\nthings go ill. The new disposition of forces was as follows: Toledo\r\nhad been handed over to the _partida_ of El Medico, since no French\r\nreconnaissances had come in this direction, and it was clear that the\r\nenemy had no serious intentions on this flank. The extreme right wing\r\nof the army was formed by the 4th Division, now once more under General\r\nCole, who had come up, cured of his wound, from the Salamanca hospital.\r\nIt lay at Añover, behind the point where the Jarama flows into the\r\nTagus, with its flank covered by the Gunten river and some of Long’s\r\ndragoons. Next in line, six miles to the North, was Skerrett’s force,\r\nholding the Puente Larga, the main passage over the Jarama river,\r\ntwo miles north of Aranjuez. Beyond him were the 3rd Division and\r\nHamilton’s Portuguese about Valdemoro and St. Martin de la Vega. Then\r\ncame the Light Division at Alcalá de Henares[128]: Carlos de España’s\r\nand Morillo’s Spaniards were in their company. Elio’s Murcians were\r\ndirected to fall back on Guadalajara. So much for the infantry: the\r\ncavalry was kept out in front, with orders to keep a line of vedettes\r\non the Tagus till they should be driven in, and then to hold the course\r\nof the Tajuna in a similar fashion, before breaking its bridges and\r\nfalling back on to the Henares and Jarama, the real fighting line. But\r\nnothing was to be risked, and the main body of each brigade was to keep\r\nitself in front of a practicable crossing, by which it could retreat\r\nwhen the enemy should have shown himself in force. ‘Sir Rowland,’\r\nwrote his Quartermaster-General, ‘wishes you to keep the posts on the\r\nTajuna, and those in front of it (on the Tagus), as long as you can\r\nwith safety. Cover the line of the Henares _as long as you can_.’[129]\r\nSlade’s, Long’s, and Campbell’s Portuguese squadrons had the right,\r\ncovering the river bank from Aranjuez to Villamanrique with their\r\nvedettes, D’Urban, Victor Alten, and Penne Villemur held the left, from\r\nVillamanrique up stream.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 28th the French cavalry, having detected the disappearance\r\nof Hill’s infantry, crossed the Tagus both at Aranjuez and Fuente\r\nDueñas in force, whereupon the allied horse retired behind the Tajuna\r\nand broke all of its bridges. Soult at once commenced to repair the\r\nbridges of Aranjuez, and brought an infantry division forward into the\r\ntown on the 29th, but made no serious effort to feel Hill’s position\r\nbehind the Jarama and Tajuna, being determined not to involve himself\r\nin heavy fighting till King Joseph and the column from Cuenca were up\r\nin line. The head of the Army of the Centre, however, reached Fuente\r\nDueñas this same day, and began to pass[130], meeting (of course) with\r\nno opposition. But the reconstruction of the bridge took some time,\r\nand D’Erlon’s infantry was not across the Tagus in any force till the\r\nnext day. The King himself rode to Ocaña, conferred there with Soult,\r\nand made arrangements for a general forward movement upon the 30th.\r\nThere would have been heavy fighting upon the 30th-31st, if Hill had\r\nbeen permitted to make a stand on his chosen position with the 40,000\r\nmen whom he had placed in line between Alcalá and Añover. He had now\r\nall his troops concentrated except Elio’s Murcians, who lay out in the\r\ndirection of Guadalajara with no enemy in front of them. But on the\r\nmorning of the 29th Hill received a dispatch from Wellington, dated\r\nfrom Cabezon on the night of the 27th, which upset all the arrangements\r\nmade hitherto. The important paragraph of it ran as follows: ‘The enemy\r\nare infinitely superior to us in cavalry, and from what I saw to-day\r\nvery superior in infantry also. We must retire, and the Douro is no\r\nbarrier for us. If we go, and cannot hold our ground beyond the Douro,\r\nyour situation will become delicate. We certainly cannot stand against\r\nthe numbers opposed to us in any situation, and it appears to me to be\r\nnecessary that you, as well as we, should retire. The only doubt which\r\nI entertain is about the road which you should take, and that doubt\r\noriginates in the insufficiency of this army to stop the army opposed\r\nto it for a sufficient time to allow you to reach the Adaja. I propose\r\nto remain on the Pisuerga to-morrow (October 28) and as long as I can\r\nupon the Douro, and then to retire by Arevalo. God knows whether I\r\nshall be able to remain on either river!; and if I cannot, your retreat\r\nshould be by the valley of the Tagus. If I can remain, we should\r\njoin as arranged by previous letters. If I can remain on the Pisuerga\r\nto-morrow, I shall pass the Douro on the 29th, and shall probably be\r\nable to prevent the enemy from crossing in force till the 1st November,\r\nin which case I shall reach Arevalo on the 3rd. You will not receive\r\nthis letter till the 29th. You will arrive at the Escurial, probably\r\non the 31st, at Villacastin on the 2nd, at Arevalo on the 4th....\r\nIf I should not be able to hold my ground either on the Pisuerga or\r\nthe Douro, I shall apprise you of it at the first moment, and shall\r\nsuggest your line of retreat.... Your march, as proposed (i.e. via the\r\nGuadarrama) at least as far as Villacastin, would be secure, whereas\r\nthat by Talavera, &c., would not, till you shall cross the Tagus. Do\r\nnot order the bridge at Almaraz to be taken up or destroyed, till you\r\nare certain you do not want it.’[131] The dispatch ended by directing\r\nHill to bring on with him Carlos de España’s, Morillo’s, and Penne\r\nVillemur’s Spaniards, but to order Freire, Elio, and Bassecourt to join\r\nBallasteros by the route of Toledo, while the Empecinado had better go\r\nto his old haunts in the mountains beyond Guadalajara.\r\n\r\nThis was a most alarming dispatch for Hill. Just as he had assumed\r\nhis fighting position, and was expecting to be attacked by Soult on\r\nthe following day, he received orders to retire without a moment’s\r\ndelay. And what was worst of all, he was told that the line of\r\nretreat indicated to him would not improbably prove dangerous or\r\nimpossible, and that he might, within the next day or so, get a\r\ncounter-order, directing him to retire by the line of the Tagus and\r\nAlmaraz, since a junction with Wellington behind the Adaja might prove\r\nimpossible. But a retreat across the front of the enemy, on the route\r\nNavalcarnero-Talavera-Almaraz, would clearly be most dangerous, since\r\nthe left wing of the Army (the Light Division, D’Urban, Alten and the\r\nSpaniards) would have forty miles to march before they were clear of\r\nthe advancing columns of the French, debouching from Aranjuez. And to\r\nmake matters worse, the enemy was terribly strong in cavalry, and the\r\ncountryside south of Madrid was very favourable to the mounted arm. If\r\nthe army should march at once for the road by the Guadarrama, and when\r\nit had reached the neighbourhood of Madrid or the Escurial should get\r\nthe news that the route to Villacastin and Arevalo had been blocked,\r\nit would be almost impossible to turn off on to the Tagus line or\r\nto make for Almaraz. The only chance left would be to take the bad\r\nmountain-road to Avila, and thence to the upper Tormes, a choice that\r\nno officer could contemplate without dismay in October.\r\n\r\nThere was one plea that might have been urged in favour of an instant\r\nmove toward Talavera and the Tagus route (the right wing to march by\r\nIllescas and Fuensalida, the left by Madrid and Navalcarnero), but it\r\nwas a plea of which neither Wellington nor Hill seems to have thought.\r\nSupposing that Hill’s 40,000 men after uncovering and evacuating Madrid\r\nshould place themselves behind the Alberche, in and about Talavera,\r\nit was difficult to believe that Soult and King Joseph would dare to\r\nmarch north to join Souham and to trouble Wellington. They could hardly\r\nleave 40,000 men behind them uncontained, and would probably have to\r\nhalt and to face toward Hill, so as to cover the capital. This threat\r\nto their flank and their rear might force the enemy to come to a stop,\r\nand might secure Wellington’s rear as effectually as a junction with\r\nhim at Arevalo behind the Adaja. But on the other hand there were\r\ntwo considerations which tended to make any use of the Tagus route\r\nundesirable, save on compulsion and as a _pis aller_. The first was\r\nthat the whole valley from Toledo to Almaraz was in a state of dreadful\r\nexhaustion, with half its land untilled and its population living on\r\nthe edge of starvation. To subsist there would be difficult. The second\r\nand more important was that the enemy might conceivably leave Soult\r\nand the Army of the South to hold Madrid and contain Hill’s force, and\r\nthen would still possess 20,000 men--of the Cuenca column--who might be\r\nsent by the Guadarrama and Villacastin to take Wellington in the rear.\r\nIt would be of little use to bring the enemy to a standstill in the\r\ndirection of Madrid, if he could still spare a detachment which would\r\nmake Wellington’s position in Old Castile hopelessly untenable, and\r\nmight even put him in grave danger of being overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nBut ‘sufficient for the day is the evil thereof’ was no doubt the\r\nreflection of Rowland Hill, a pious man well acquainted with his Bible.\r\nHe had for the present a clear order to march for the Escurial,\r\nthe Guadarrama, and Arevalo. That it might be cancelled if certain\r\ncircumstances, over which he had no control, should occur on the Douro,\r\nwas an unpleasant possibility, which did not come into consideration on\r\nthe 29th of October. Accordingly he gave orders for instant retreat.\r\nThere was little immediate danger to his left wing, since the French\r\ncolumn in front of it, at Fuente Dueñas, had to pass first the defiles\r\nof the Tajuna and then those of the Jarama, and all the bridges on\r\nboth were destroyed or ready for destruction. The right wing was in\r\na much more delicate situation, since it was separated from Soult at\r\nAranjuez only by the Jarama. The outposts of the two armies were in\r\nclose touch with each other at the Puente Larga, with nothing but the\r\nriver between; and the 4th Division at Añover had to pass behind the\r\nforce holding the Puente Larga in order to get into the Madrid road.\r\nSupposing that bridge were forced too soon, Cole would be driven off in\r\nan eccentric line of retreat toward Toledo and Talavera.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, all the rest of the army was set in motion for the\r\nEscurial at dawn on the 30th, Skerrett was ordered to stand still at\r\nthe Puente Larga, and to hold it at all costs till the rest of the\r\nallied right wing should have got clear. Meanwhile the troops about\r\nAlcalá (the Light Division, España and Morillo) marched round the north\r\nside of Madrid without entering the city, and continuing their course\r\nall day and part of the night, were on the upper Manzanares, about\r\nthe palace of El Pardo by 12 p.m. At the same time the troops about\r\nValdemoro (3rd Division, Hamilton’s Portuguese, and the bulk of the\r\ncavalry) retired past the south side of Madrid, and reached Aravaca,\r\non its west side two miles out, by night. Here Hill established his\r\nhead-quarters. The 4th Division, from Añover, which had the longest\r\nmarch of all, had been started off before the bulk of the army, on\r\nthe night of the 29th, not at dawn on the 30th like the rest. It fell\r\ninto the main road at Valdemoro before daybreak, much fatigued; while\r\nhalting there the weary men discovered more wine than was good for\r\nthem--the population had fled and left their cellars exposed for the\r\nfirst comer. There was a terrible amount of drunkenness, and so much\r\nstraggling, when the division marched off at noon, that many hundreds\r\nof men, hidden in houses in a state of absolute incapacity to move,\r\nwere left behind[132]. The division, minus its drunkards, joined the\r\nrest of the right wing at Aravaca that night. Cole remained behind\r\nhimself--while his troops marched on--to supervise the defence of the\r\nPuente Larga. He had been told to take on Skerrett’s brigade as a part\r\nof his division till further orders, and naturally stopped with the\r\nrearguard.\r\n\r\nBy the night of the 30th all the army was concentrated beyond Madrid,\r\nwithout having seen an enemy or suffered any molestation, save\r\nSkerrett’s detachment, which was fighting all day at the Puente Larga\r\nfor the protection of the rest. Soult, as Hill had expected, had\r\nresolved to force the line of the Jarama and Tajuna that day. But\r\nwhile on the right his cavalry felt forward only to the Tajuna and its\r\nbroken bridges, on the left he was already in touch with his enemy, for\r\nthe Puente Larga is only two miles outside Aranjuez, from which the\r\napproach to it lies along one of the great avenues of planes that form\r\npart of the royal Park between the Tagus and Jarama.\r\n\r\nThe Puente Larga is an immensely long bridge of 16 arches, for the\r\nJarama in winter is a very broad river. Its southern end is commanded\r\nby a slight rising ground, its northern lies in the flat and ends in\r\na causeway, by which the road finally mounts up on to the plateau of\r\nValdemoro. Thus it would have been easier to defend from the south than\r\nfrom the north, as Skerrett had to do. An attempt had been made to blow\r\nup one of the centre arches of the bridge, but though two mines had\r\nbeen laid, their explosion on the morning of the 30th did not make a\r\ncomplete breach, one parapet and a broad section of the footway beside\r\nit remaining intact. The engineer officer in charge, holding that\r\nthere was no time to make another mine, had a breastwork covered by an\r\nabattis thrown up across the northern end of the bridge. Here then was\r\na sort of terrace with balustrades and stone seats, where the bridge\r\nand causeway met. Behind the breastwork and the terrace Skerrett placed\r\nhis two companies of the 95th Rifles and part of the 2/47th, while\r\nbehind the nearer part of the causeway there was room for the supports,\r\nthe rest of the 47th and the 2/87th in close column. The ridge of the\r\ncauseway almost completely sheltered them from fire from the French\r\nside of the river, even from the most elevated ground. Three guns of\r\nBraun’s Portuguese battery were prepared for action on the right end of\r\nthe terrace, behind the hastily extemporized breastwork. Half a mile\r\nto the rear, at the north end of the causeway, was Skerrett’s reserve,\r\ncomposed of the 3rd batt. of the First Guards, the 20th Portuguese,\r\nand the remaining three pieces of Braun’s battery. The whole defending\r\nforce of five battalions and six guns was somewhat under 4,000 strong.\r\n\r\nSoult was not certain whether Hill was intending to fight on the line\r\nof the Jarama, or whether he had merely to drive in a rearguard. The\r\nday was very misty from dawn onward, and at 9 o’clock in the morning\r\nrain began, and fell continuously till night. Thus the Marshal could\r\nnot see in the least what sort of a force was opposed to him, and his\r\ncavalry, exploring up and down the river bank, were unable to find any\r\npracticable fords, or to give him any information as to whether there\r\nwere allied troops holding the entire course of the Jarama. After some\r\nhours, therefore, Soult sent forward Reymond’s division[133] with\r\norders to force the Puente Larga, as he had been informed that it was\r\nstill passable owing to the failure of the mines. A battery took post\r\non the rising ground at the south end of the bridge, and shelled the\r\nbreastwork and the Portuguese guns, while the voltigeur companies\r\nof the 12th Léger strung, themselves out along the river bank, and\r\ncommenced a long bickering fusillade with Skerrett’s men across the\r\nwater. The artillery and musketry fight went on for some hours, till\r\nBraun’s three pieces ceased firing for want of ammunition. Thinking\r\nthis a favourable moment, Soult sent part of the 12th Léger against the\r\nbridge--the head of the column never reached the narrow pass at the\r\nhalf-broken eighth arch, suffering so much from the musketry that it\r\nfell back in disorder before getting half-way across. Another regiment,\r\nor the same re-formed, attempted a similar rush a few minutes later,\r\nand was repulsed in the same fashion. Thereupon Soult ordered the\r\nattack to cease, ‘seeing,’ as he says in his dispatch, ‘that we were\r\nwasting ammunition to no effect.’ He drew off both his guns and his\r\nvoltigeurs, and the combat came to an end. A French officer appeared\r\non to the bridge with a white flag a little later, and got permission\r\nto remove the many wounded lying at its south end. After dark Skerrett\r\nwithdrew very quietly, leaving dummy sentries on the bridge head and\r\nthe causeway, who were only detected as straw-stuffed great-coats at\r\ndawn next morning. The brigade, therefore, had an undisturbed march all\r\nnight, and halted next morning on the Prado of Madrid, where it was\r\nallowed a few hours of rest. Its loss had been about 3 officers and 60\r\nmen killed and wounded, of whom 40 were in the 2/47th and 11 in the\r\nrifle companies. The French had five officers and about 100 men killed\r\nand wounded[134]. The whole fight was much what the combat of the Coa\r\nwould have been in 1810, if Craufurd had fought behind and not before\r\nthe bridge of Almeida.\r\n\r\nSoult had deduced, from the stubborn way in which the Puente Larga was\r\ndefended, that Hill was standing to fight a general action behind the\r\nJarama. He made during the night preparations for bringing up much\r\nartillery and constructing bridges, but discovered at dawn that his\r\nexertions had been unnecessary. Cavalry under Pierre Soult were pushed\r\nout as far as Valdemoro, and captured there some 300 drunken stragglers\r\nbelonging to the 4th Division, who had not thought fit to follow\r\nSkerrett when he passed through. The day was one of dense fog, and the\r\nyounger Soult never got in touch with Hill’s rearguard, but picked up\r\na rumour that Wellington was expected at Madrid that day, with two\r\ndivisions from Burgos, and that the whole allied army was prepared to\r\ndeliver battle in a position outside the capital. In consequence, his\r\nbrother the Marshal held back, and contented himself with bringing up\r\nthe entire Army of the South to the Jarama, while he sent his false\r\nnews to King Joseph and Jourdan. He proposed that the Cuenca column\r\nshould make no attempt to force the higher course of the Tajuna, where\r\nall the bridges were broken, and behind which lay the equally tiresome\r\nobstacle of the Henares, but should come round to Aranjuez and cross\r\nby the Puente Larga. Jourdan advised compliance, remarking that the\r\nforcing of the lines of the Tajuna and Henares and the making of\r\nbridges upon them might take many days. To save time the right wing\r\ncame round to join the left[135].\r\n\r\nThis was a godsend to Hill, as it resulted in no pursuit being made\r\non the 31st; the French advanced cavalry only entered Madrid on the\r\n1st November, and the second of that month had arrived before any\r\ninfantry reached the capital. By that day the allied army was over\r\nthe Guadarrama, and well on its way to Villacastin and Arevalo. The\r\nevacuation of Madrid was accompanied with many distressing incidents:\r\nthe people were in despair at seeing themselves about to fall back once\r\nmore into the power of the ‘Intrusive King’. Many of the notables had\r\ncommitted themselves so openly to the patriotic cause that they thought\r\nit wise to depart in company with Hill’s army. An order to burn the\r\nconsiderable stores of provisions which could not be brought off led\r\nto a riot--the lower classes were on the edge of starvation, and the\r\nsight of good food being wasted led them to make a disorderly rush on\r\nthe magazines, to drive away the commissaries, and to carry off the\r\nflour and salt meat which was being destroyed. Probably it would have\r\nbeen wise to permit them to do so without making difficulties; as the\r\nstores, once dispersed, could hardly have been gathered in again by\r\nthe enemy. The explosion of the Arsenal in the Retiro fort was a more\r\nabsolute necessity, but the Madrileños murmured greatly that the large\r\nbuilding of La China, the porcelain manufactory, was blown up along\r\nwith the surrounding earthworks. The mines, it may be incidentally\r\nremarked, were so carelessly laid that two commissariat officers were\r\nkilled by the first of them that went off, and the last nearly made an\r\nend of Captain Cleeves, K.G.L., the artillery officer in charge of\r\nthe business. He was severely scorched, and barely escaped with his\r\nlife[136].\r\n\r\nThe rearguard of the British Army quitted the mourning city by noon on\r\nthe 31st October: the head of the column was already on that day at the\r\nEscurial. On November 1st the passage of the Guadarrama began, and on\r\nthe 3rd the last cavalry brigade, bringing up the rear, was over the\r\nmountains. Not a sign had been seen of the enemy, whose advanced light\r\ncavalry only reached Galapagar, five miles south of the Escurial upon\r\nthe 2nd. The weather, however, was very bad, rain falling day after\r\nday, and this must serve as an inadequate excuse for the fact that\r\nstraggling had already begun, and that a certain number of men dropped\r\nso far behind that they fell into the hands of the tardily-appearing\r\nenemy. But the loss of these laggards, for the most part the selected\r\nbad characters of each battalion, was a small price to pay for an\r\nunmolested retreat. Hill’s spirits rose, hour by hour, as he received\r\nno letter from Wellington to say that the retreat to Arevalo had become\r\nimpossible, or that the line of the Douro had been lost. These terrible\r\npossibilities might--so far as he knew--have come into existence at any\r\nmoment on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd of November. On the 4th the whole army\r\nfrom Madrid was concentrated at Villacastin, so close to Wellington’s\r\nposition behind the Douro at Rueda that dispatches could now get\r\nthrough from him to Hill in less than twelve hours. The cavalry of the\r\nextreme rearguard--the 2nd Hussars K.G.L., who had left the Escurial\r\nonly on the 3rd, had barely seen the enemy’s advanced vedettes on that\r\nday, and were not overtaken by them till late on the 4th. The pursuit\r\nwas slow, cautious, and not executed by any very large body of horse.\r\nHill, therefore, granted his troops a very necessary rest of twelve\r\nhours at Villacastin.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, on the evening of November 4th, when the worst\r\npossibilities seemed to have passed by, and nothing could any longer\r\nprevent Hill from joining Wellington, discouraging news, so long\r\nexpected, at last came to hand. A dispatch from Rueda informed Hill\r\nthat his chief had determined to retreat from the line of the Douro,\r\nfor reasons which will be explained in the next chapter, and that the\r\nposition in which he intended to fight was that in front of Salamanca,\r\nwhere he had faced and beaten Marmont in July. This being so, there was\r\nno reason to bring up Hill’s corps to Arevalo. Since a junction between\r\nthe two halves of the army was now secure, the troops from Madrid\r\nshould save themselves an unnecessary détour to the north, by turning\r\noff the _chaussée_ to Valladolid and taking the cross-road by Belayos,\r\nVillanueva de Gomez, and Peñaranda. This would bring them to Alba de\r\nTormes, where they would find themselves in touch with Wellington’s\r\nown troops, which would move, by La Nava and Cantalpino, to the San\r\nCristobal position outside Salamanca.\r\n\r\nThis march therefore Hill executed. On the 4th he had at last heard of\r\nthe appearance of Soult’s cavalry, and that same evening his extreme\r\nrearguard, the 2nd Hussars of the K.G.L. had a slight engagement with\r\nFrench squadrons near Villacastin. But nothing was known of the main\r\nbody of the enemy’s infantry, nor was it even certain whether the Army\r\nof the South and the Army of the Centre were both pursuing by the route\r\nof the Guadarrama. Soult, as a matter of fact, had only made up his\r\nmind to cross the mountains by that route on the 3rd, and nothing but\r\nthe light cavalry of his brother was near Hill’s rear. On the 4th, 5th,\r\nand 6th November his main body was coming up, and he was in force at\r\nArevalo on the last-named day. Only the horse of his advanced guard had\r\nfollowed Hill on the Peñaranda road. The object of the move on Arevalo\r\nwas to seek for the Army of Portugal, of which no certain news had yet\r\nbeen obtained. The Duke of Dalmatia supposed however that it had to be\r\nlooked for on the side of Tordesillas, and wished to communicate with\r\nit before he pressed Hill too closely. For if the latter had united\r\nwith Wellington--as was very possible--he might have found himself\r\nin face of more than 60,000 men, and he had but 40,000 of his own,\r\nsince the Army of the Centre was not yet up in line. The King himself\r\nwith his Guards followed Soult after a short interval, but the three\r\ninfantry divisions (Barrois, Palombini, Darmagnac) which had formed the\r\ncolumn that marched from Cuenca, were far behind. Palombini’s division,\r\nwhich had been told off to act as the rearguard, was observing the\r\naccumulation of Spanish troops near Guadalajara, where Elio and\r\nFreire had now been joined by the Empecinado, who had come in from\r\nthe direction of Aragon. They had united at the Puente de Aunion and\r\nSacedon, a few miles south-east of Guadalajara, on the upper Tagus.\r\nThere were now 8,000 or 9,000 enemies in this quarter, still quite\r\nclose to Madrid, and Joseph and Jourdan had to come to a difficult\r\ndecision. If a garrison were left in Madrid, and a strong column sent\r\nto evict Elio from his position, the Army of the Centre would have few\r\ntroops left who could follow Soult in the pursuit of Wellington. But\r\nif the whole Army of the Centre marched by the Guadarrama, there was\r\nnothing to prevent Elio from coming down to reoccupy Madrid, and the\r\npolitical effect of the evacuation of the capital would be detestable,\r\nfor it would look as if the whole French army was but a flying column\r\nincapable of holding what it had won[137]. After some hesitation\r\nthe King and Jourdan resolved that the military necessity of taking\r\nforward every available man to crush Wellington was all-important. If\r\nSoult alone joined the Army of Portugal in Old Castile the French in\r\nthis direction would not outnumber the combined forces of Wellington\r\nand Hill, and might be brought to a stand--perhaps even beaten. The\r\n20,000 men of the Cuenca column must be brought forward at all costs\r\nto secure a numerical superiority for the French arms in the North.\r\nMadrid therefore must be abandoned, and the infantry of the King’s army\r\nmarched out of it on the 6th and 8th November, Palombini bringing up\r\nthe rear once more. Even the sick and Joseph’s Spanish courtiers had to\r\nbe taken on, with a comfortless assurance that they might in the end\r\nbe dropped at Valladolid[138]. On the 8th the leading division of the\r\nArmy of the Centre reached Villacastin by forced marches, the rear\r\ndid not get up till the 10th[139]. Thus it is clear that on November\r\n5th, when Hill executed his flank movement on Fontiveros and Peñaranda,\r\nthere was nothing near him save Soult’s advanced cavalry, supported at\r\nan interval by the infantry of the Army of the South, while the Army of\r\nthe Centre had not even left Madrid. If Wellington had but known this,\r\nit might have brought about a change in his orders; but--as cannot too\r\noften be repeated--the ‘fog of war’ sometimes lies very thick around a\r\ngeneral at the moment when he has to make his crucial decision, and on\r\nthese two days the enemy _might_ have been closed up, instead of being\r\nstrung out in detachments over a hundred miles of mountain roads. A\r\nfew days after the French left Madrid the Empecinado came down to the\r\ncapital and occupied it--Elio had gone off, according to Wellington’s\r\noriginal orders, to place himself in communication with the Army of\r\nAndalusia (now no longer under Ballasteros) and took post in La Mancha.\r\nBassecourt reoccupied Cuenca. There was not a French soldier left in\r\nNew Castile, and all communication between Soult and King Joseph on one\r\nside and Suchet in Valencia on the other, were completely broken off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BURGOS RETREAT. THE OPERATIONS ROUND SALAMANCA. NOVEMBER 1-NOVEMBER\r\n15, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we turned aside to narrate the operations round Madrid, and\r\nHill’s retreat across the Guadarrama Pass, we left Wellington and his\r\narmy on November 1st drawn up on the south side of the Douro, with\r\nhead-quarters at Rueda. Their right flank was covered by the Adaja,\r\nthe cavalry of their left flank was opposite Toro, where the French\r\nwere visible in some force, and were known to be repairing the bridge\r\nwhich had been destroyed on October 30th. It was evident that the\r\nmain body of the enemy still lay about Tordesillas, Simancas, and\r\nValladolid, but its exact strength was not ascertainable. A rumour\r\nhad crossed the river that Caffarelli and the Army of the North were\r\nalready returning to their own regions beyond Burgos; it was a true\r\nrumour, but Wellington could get no confirmation for it[140]. Till the\r\nfacts were ascertained, he was bound to consider it probable that the\r\nwhole body of the enemy--nearly 50,000 strong--which had pursued him\r\nsince October 22nd was still in his front[141]. With such a force he\r\nconsidered himself unable to cope, if once it crossed the river whose\r\nline he was defending. ‘They are infinitely superior to us in cavalry,\r\nand from what I saw to-day (October 27) were superior in infantry\r\nalso. We must retire therefore, and the Douro is no barrier for us.’\r\nHe held on however in the position that he had taken up on October 30\r\ntill November 5, partly because he was wishing to cover as long as\r\npossible Hill’s march to join him from Madrid, partly because Souham\r\nmade no attempt for some days to debouch in force across the bridges of\r\nTordesillas or Toro.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the near approach of Hill and the force from Madrid, with\r\nSoult’s army in pursuit, was modifying the position from day to day.\r\nBy November 4th Hill, as we have already seen, was at Villacastin with\r\nall his five infantry divisions, and the 7,000 or 8,000 Spaniards of\r\nMorillo and Carlos de España. He was being followed by the French, but\r\nreported that day that he had so far seen no more than four regiments\r\nof cavalry and two battalions of infantry. Was this the advanced\r\nguard of the whole 60,000 men whom Soult and King Joseph had brought\r\nagainst Madrid, or was it a mere corps of observation? ‘I do not think\r\nit clear,’ wrote Wellington to Hill, at 9 o’clock on the morning of\r\nNovember 5th, ‘that the enemy is following you in force. I conceive\r\nthese four regiments and two battalions to have been sent only to see\r\nwhat you are doing.’[142] This day Wellington could have united himself\r\nto Hill without any fear of being hindered by either of the French\r\narmies, and could have had the whole of his 65,000 men concentrated\r\nbetween Medina del Campo and Arevalo within thirty-six hours. The\r\nenemy, though their two armies taken together outnumbered him by more\r\nthan 25,000 men, could not possibly unite within a similar time. He\r\nhad, therefore, the position which enterprising generals most desire,\r\nthat of lying between the two fractions of a hostile force, which\r\ncannot combine easily, and of being able to bring superior numbers\r\nagainst either one of them. One can speculate without much difficulty\r\nas to what Napoleon would have done in a similar posture of affairs.\r\n\r\nBut Wellington, after mature consideration, resolved that it would not\r\nbe prudent to unite the two halves of his army and to march against\r\none or other of his enemies. It is fortunate that he has left a record\r\nof the reasons which prevented him from doing so. They are contained\r\nin a dispatch to Lord Bathurst dated November 8th, when he had already\r\ncommitted himself to a wholly different policy. If he were to march\r\nwith his own army, he wrote, to join Hill about Arevalo, with the\r\nobject of falling upon the heads of Soult’s columns as they debouched\r\non Villacastin, Souham could cross the Douro unopposed behind him at\r\nToro, whose bridge was now repaired, and get behind his left flank.\r\nWhile he was engaged with Soult and the King, who might conceivably\r\nhave 50,000 men at the front[143], and be able to offer a good\r\nresistance, Souham could close in on his rear, and after cutting him\r\noff from Salamanca and his magazines, could attack him, while he was\r\ncommitted to the contest with the army from Madrid.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he took the second alternative, and brought\r\nHill’s column up to Medina del Campo and Tordesillas, Souham would keep\r\nnorth of the Douro, and could not be assailed: ‘the enemy would not\r\nattempt to pass so long as we remained in our position.’ But meanwhile\r\nSoult and the King, being unopposed by Hill, might cut him off from his\r\nbase and magazines, because the line Villacastin-Fontiveros-Salamanca\r\nis shorter than that from Tordesillas to Salamanca. ‘The enemy would\r\nhave had the shortest line to the Tormes by Fontiveros, if they had\r\npreferred to march in that direction rather than to follow the march of\r\nSir Rowland Hill’s troops.’\r\n\r\nThis last argument, it must be confessed, seems disputable,\r\nfor not only are the roads Rueda-Fuentesauco-Salamanca and\r\nRueda-Pitiegua-Salamanca as a matter of fact no longer than the road\r\nVillacastin-Fontiveros-Peñaranda-Salamanca[144], but they were in all\r\nrespects better roads, through a level country, while the route which\r\nWellington assigns to the enemy (and which Hill actually pursued)\r\npasses through much more difficult and hilly regions, and was but a\r\ncross-country line of communications. It would seem doubtful also\r\nwhether there was any probability that the enemy, granting that he\r\nhad his whole force concentrated at the front, would dare to take\r\nthis route, since it was the one which made a junction with Souham\r\nand the Army of Portugal most difficult to him. Soult and Joseph were\r\nvery badly informed as to the exact situation of their friends from\r\nthe North, but it was clear that they would have to be looked for\r\nrather in the direction of Tordesillas and Valladolid than in that of\r\nSalamanca. As a matter of fact, even after Wellington’s retreat, Soult\r\ntook the trouble to move on Arevalo, instead of marching on Fontiveros\r\nand Peñaranda, for the sole purpose of getting into communication with\r\nSouham, whose co-operation was all-important to him.\r\n\r\nBut putting this particular objection aside, it seems certain that if\r\nWellington had concentrated opposite Souham, behind the Douro, Soult\r\nand the King could not have been prevented from getting into touch\r\nwith the Army of Portugal by taking the route Villacastin, Segovia,\r\nOlmedo, keeping the Adaja between them and the Allies, and making for\r\nthe upper passages of the Douro (Tudela, &c.), which Wellington had\r\nsurrendered to Souham on October 30th. This fact is conclusive against\r\nthe policy of drawing up Hill to Rueda and making a move against the\r\nnorthern enemy. Though a march by Soult and Joseph against Salamanca\r\nwas improbable, there were perfectly sound reasons for rejecting this\r\nparticular combination.\r\n\r\nAs much cannot be said on purely strategical grounds for Wellington’s\r\nresolution to retreat on Salamanca instead of making a blow at\r\nSoult--his old original plan of September and October. Supposing that\r\nhe had left nothing more than a screen along the Douro to ‘contain’\r\nSouham--say the Galicians and a little cavalry--he could have joined\r\nHill at or near Arevalo on the 5th or 6th, and have calculated on a\r\ncouple of days’ start before the Army of Portugal could have followed\r\nhim--it had to concentrate from scattered cantonments and to cross on\r\none or other of two ill-repaired bridges. Meanwhile Soult would have\r\nbeen caught on the 6th with his 40,000 men strung out on many miles of\r\nmountain road, and with his supports (the Army of the Centre) still\r\nat Madrid--they did not even start for the Guadarrama till that same\r\nday. It is clear that the Duke of Dalmatia would have had to retreat in\r\nhaste, under pain of suffering a disaster: his advance guard might very\r\npossibly have been cut up and maltreated, and he would have had to\r\nfall back on the passes, where food was unobtainable, and long sojourn\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThis would have been the Napoleonic method of dealing with the\r\nsituation. But it would be absurd to blame Wellington for not adopting\r\nsuch a plan. Now, as always, he had to play the safer game, simply\r\nbecause he could not afford to take risks. Napoleon could face with\r\nindifference the loss of 5,000 or 10,000 men from a forced march in\r\nbad weather, ending in an operation that miscarried--such had been\r\nhis march against Sir John Moore in December 1808. Wellington could\r\nnot. The season at the moment was singularly unfavourable for a sudden\r\noffensive stroke, involving rapid movement. The troops were almost worn\r\nout: Hill’s column had only just terminated a fatiguing retreat, the\r\ntroops from Burgos had only been granted five days’ rest since the end\r\nof a similar march. The number of sick (about 17,000) was alarming,\r\nand many battalions were already reduced to 250 or 300 bayonets.\r\nWhat was worse, straggling had shown itself in the most vexatious\r\nform, not only among the troops of Wellington’s own column, but among\r\nHill’s divisions, which ought to have done better after their long\r\nsojourn in quiet cantonments round Madrid. A sudden dash to surprise\r\nSoult by forced marches upon Villacastin would have been very costly,\r\neven before the fighting began. And if the Marshal refused to stand,\r\nand simply retired in haste toward the Army of the Centre, it would\r\nbe impossible to push him far. Meanwhile Souham would be across the\r\nDouro, and threatening Salamanca, or approaching Wellington’s own rear.\r\nAfter all there remained the cardinal fact that the enemy had a great\r\nnumerical superiority: it was even over-estimated in Wellington’s own\r\nmind, since he thought that Caffarelli and the Army of the North were\r\nstill at Valladolid.\r\n\r\nHence came his final decision to retreat by easy marches toward the\r\nstrong positions about Salamanca, leaving the offensive to the enemy,\r\nand granting them the opportunity of uniting their two long-separated\r\narmies. Wellington’s own plea in favour of this resolve must be\r\nquoted--‘The two corps of this army, particularly that which has been\r\nin the North, are in want of rest. They have been continually in the\r\nfield, and almost continually marching, since the month of January\r\nlast; their clothes and equipments are much worn, and a period in\r\ncantonments would be very useful to them. The cavalry likewise are weak\r\nin numbers, and the horses rather low in condition. I should wish to\r\nbe able to canton the troops for a short time, and I should prefer the\r\ncantonments on the Tormes to those farther in the rear. I do not know\r\nexactly what the force of the enemy is. The Army of Portugal have about\r\n36,000 men, of which 4,000 is cavalry[145]. The Army of the North have\r\n10,000 men, of which 1,200 is cavalry. It is hard to judge of the exact\r\nextent of Soult’s force. It is reported that the enemy brought from\r\nValencia to the Tagus from 40,000 to 45,000 men, but I should consider\r\nthis to be rather below the number that the Armies of Andalusia and the\r\nCentre could bring up, without any troops from the Armies of Aragon and\r\nValencia[146]. Soult is particularly strong in good cavalry, and there\r\nare several more regiments in the Army of the Centre. It will remain\r\nto be seen what number of troops can be brought to operate against our\r\nposition (on the Tormes): as unless Madrid should be again abandoned to\r\nits fate by the King, he must make arrangements to resist the attacks\r\nwhich Elio and the guerrilleros (the Empecinado, El Medico, &c.) will\r\nmake on that city, even if General Ballasteros should not move forward\r\nin La Mancha. I propose therefore to wait at present on the Tormes,\r\ntill I shall ascertain more exactly the extent of the enemy’s force. If\r\nthey should move forward, I can either bring the contest to a crisis on\r\nthe positions of San Christoval, or fall back to the Agueda, according\r\nto what I shall at the time consider to be best for the cause[147].’\r\n\r\nWellington’s estimate of a total force for the enemy of rather\r\nmore than 90,000 men was not far out, for if he wrongly supposed\r\nthat Caffarelli might still be at the front with his 10,000 men,\r\nhe underrated the total of the Armies of the South and Centre very\r\nconsiderably. They had not merely the something over 45,000 men of\r\nwhich he wrote, but nearly 60,000. But he was under the impression that\r\nKing Joseph would probably leave a large detachment to defend Madrid;\r\nand if the enemy came forward against the line of the Tormes with\r\nanything less than 70,000 men, he was prepared to defend it. His own\r\nforce, counting Hill, but allowing for the losses on the retreats from\r\nBurgos and Madrid, which would amount to about 2,000 at the most, would\r\nbe not far below that same figure, including 18,000 Spaniards. But the\r\nstrength of the position would compensate for the inferior value of\r\nthese auxiliaries in line of battle. Just at this moment Wellington was\r\nnot at all contented with the Galicians, whose conduct at Palencia and\r\nVilla Muriel had irritated him. ‘I was sorry to observe,’ he wrote to\r\nLord Bathurst, ‘that in the affair of the 25th October, although the\r\nSpanish soldiers showed no want of spirit or of disposition to engage\r\nthe enemy, they were totally unable to move with the regularity and\r\norder of a disciplined body--by which alone success can be hoped for in\r\nany contest with the French[148].’\r\n\r\nThere were three possibilities before Wellington when he had made up\r\nhis mind to retire to the Tormes. The French might be contented with\r\nhaving driven him out of New Castile and away from the Douro, and\r\npress him no farther. This would be quite probable, if they had made\r\nup their minds to detach a large force to hold Madrid. Or, secondly,\r\nthey might come up against him to Salamanca, with a force no greater\r\nthan his own. In this case he was prepared to fight, and hoped to come\r\nwell out of the business. Thirdly, there was the chance that they\r\nmight bring forward every available man, and try to evict him from his\r\nchosen position: if they were in very great strength he must yield,\r\nand go back to the Agueda and the shelter of Ciudad Rodrigo, much\r\ncontrary to his desire. But he was not intending to give way, and to\r\ninvolve himself in the difficulties of a retreat during the cold and\r\nrainy month of November, until he should be convinced that the French\r\nwere too strong for him and that a rearward move was inevitable. In\r\nthe Salamanca positions he could force them to show their strength,\r\nand yet have the power to draw off if that strength proved to be\r\noverpowering.\r\n\r\nThe retreat towards Salamanca commenced on November 5th, when\r\nWellington both directed Hill to move on Fontiveros and Flores de\r\nAvila instead of on Arevalo, and also began to shift his own troops\r\nsouth-westward from the position about Rueda. On this day the 5th\r\nDivision and Ponsonby’s cavalry brigade marched for Alaejos. The rest\r\nof the Army were warned that their movement would begin next day[149].\r\nIt was well to keep Souham beyond the Douro, by continuing to show\r\ngreat strength in his front, till Hill should have got some way\r\nwestward. There was no sign of activity in the enemy’s cantonments,\r\nsave that troops seemed to be moving towards Toro along the road on\r\nthe north bank parallel with the river[150]. The retreat was therefore\r\ncarried out in a leisurely fashion on the 6th-7th-8th: on the 6th\r\nWellington’s head-quarters were at Torrecilla de la Orden, on the 7th\r\nand 8th at Pitiegua. The divisions, covered by a cavalry rearguard, and\r\nwith other cavalry on their flank, thrown out to observe the French\r\nat Toro, marched by several converging roads, some going through\r\nAlaejos, others through Castrejon and Vallesa, others by Fresno and\r\nCantalpino[151]. There was no hurry, as there was no pursuit, and by\r\nthe evening of the 8th all were safely placed in their old positions\r\nof June, north of the Tormes, in a semicircle from Aldea Lengua to San\r\nCristobal. The weather being still very cold and rainy, as many of the\r\ntroops were quartered in the villages as possible, and some as far back\r\nas Salamanca town; but many had to bivouac in the open. After several\r\nnights spent in position, dysentery and rheumatism, which had already\r\nbeen thinning the ranks, became more common than ever.\r\n\r\nHill’s column, meanwhile, having left the main road at Villacastin on\r\nthe 4th and having followed the bad cross-paths between Belayos and\r\nFontiveros, got into a better route at the latter place, which it\r\nreached after a very fatiguing march on the night of the 5th. D’Urban’s\r\nPortuguese horse, covering the north flank of the retreat, had a\r\nnarrow escape of being cut off from the main column, near Villanueva\r\nde Gomez, by Soult’s advanced cavalry, which was pushing up northward\r\nto Arevalo, but D’Urban got across their front in time. Hill’s Spanish\r\ndivisions did not follow the same road as the British, but had moved\r\nfrom Villacastin to Arevalo on the 4th, covered by their own cavalry\r\n(Penne Villemur): on the 5th they marched from Arevalo to Fontiveros\r\nand rejoined Hill’s head-quarters[152]. They had moved along two sides\r\nof a triangle, the British only along the base--but the advantage of a\r\ngood road as opposed to a very bad one compensated for the difference\r\nof miles covered. Presumably the order to Hill to take the wretched\r\nby-paths that he followed was dictated by the idea that, if these\r\nroutes were neglected, Soult might send a column along them, and\r\nanticipate Hill on the upper Tormes. Nothing of the kind was attempted;\r\nthe Marshal’s only preoccupation at this time was that he must at all\r\ncosts look for the Army of Portugal, and his explorations were directed\r\nnorth, toward Arevalo. Hill’s rear was only followed by a vanguard of\r\nlight cavalry, which behaved with great caution, and contented itself\r\nwith gathering up stragglers, who fell behind the column by their\r\nown fault or from exhaustion. Soult claims to have taken some 600 of\r\nthem[153], a figure which English authorities reduce by about half:\r\nsome scores of drunkards were undoubtedly captured in the wine vaults\r\nof Villacastin[154].\r\n\r\nOn the 6th Hill’s column marched from Fontiveros to Peñaranda, the\r\nLight Division and Morillo forming the infantry rearguard, covered at a\r\ndistance by Long’s and Victor Alten’s squadrons. On the 7th the stage\r\ncovered was from Peñaranda to Coca (not far from Garcia Hernandez)\r\nwithin easy reach of the Tormes, whose passage it was evident would\r\nbe made without any interference by the enemy. On the 8th, the day\r\non which Wellington entered the San Cristobal position, Hill crossed\r\nthe Tormes at Alba, leaving Howard’s brigade of the 2nd Division and\r\nHamilton’s Portuguese to hold that town, which lies on the east bank\r\nof the river. It was intended to maintain Alba as a sort of _tête de\r\npont_ to cover the bridge. Though dominated by heights a few hundred\r\nyards away[155], it was extremely suitable for defence against an\r\nenemy unprovided with heavy artillery. It was surrounded by an old\r\nMoorish wall, with gaps that could easily be blocked, and its castle,\r\na solid donjon, completely commanded and protected the bridge. Slade’s\r\ncavalry brigade remained out as a screen in front of Alba, to watch\r\nfor the approach of the enemy. When the rest of the troops had crossed\r\nthe Tormes, Wellington directed Hill to send him the 3rd, 4th, and\r\nLight Divisions, España’s Spaniards, and Victor Alten’s and D’Urban’s\r\ncavalry. The force left under his lieutenant was now to consist, as in\r\nthe early summer, of nothing more than the old Estremaduran corps--the\r\n2nd Division, Hamilton’s Portuguese, the British cavalry of Slade and\r\nLong, the Portuguese cavalry of Campbell and the Spanish squadrons of\r\nPenne Villemur--about 20,000 men of the three nations. These remained\r\nbehind Alba, in the woods above the Tormes. The troops requisitioned\r\nfrom Hill moved up to Calvarisa de Arriba, Machacon, and other villages\r\nin the angle of the Tormes facing Huerta, from whence they could be\r\ndrawn into the San Cristobal position, by the fords of Aldea Lengua\r\nand Santa Marta, if necessary. The whole army, not much under 70,000\r\nstrong, was now formed in line from San Cristobal to Alba, waiting to\r\nsee whether the advance of the enemy would be by the eastern or the\r\nnorthern bend of the river.\r\n\r\nThe French were slow in making their appearance, and still slower in\r\ndeveloping their intentions. For some days there was little more than\r\ncavalry seen in front of Wellington’s position. The reason of their\r\ntardy appearance was that Soult had carried out his design of uniting\r\nwith the Army of Portugal before attempting to press the Allies. On\r\nthe 8th he was still at Arevalo in person, with the main body of his\r\ninfantry: light cavalry alone had followed Hill. Only on the preceding\r\nnight had his scouts, pushing out in the direction of Medina del\r\nCampo, succeeded in discovering Souham, who had crossed the bridge of\r\nTordesillas on the 6th, after Wellington’s departure from Rueda, and\r\nhad sent reconnaissances in all directions to look for the Army of the\r\nSouth, whose approach had come to his knowledge not by any dispatch\r\nreceived but only by the vague rumours of the countryside. Meanwhile,\r\nhe had held back his infantry, being not too sure that Wellington\r\nmight not have evacuated Rueda only as a trick, to lure him forward:\r\nit was possible that he had been joined by Hill, and was waiting a few\r\nmiles back from the Douro, with the object of falling upon the Army\r\nof Portugal with superior strength, as it should be debouching from\r\nthe bridge of Tordesillas. But the roads were found empty in every\r\ndirection, and presently Souham’s cavalry came in touch with Soult’s,\r\nand both sides discovered the exact situation.\r\n\r\nSoult, Jourdan, and the King agreed that their best policy was to bring\r\nevery man forward from all the three armies, and to force Wellington to\r\nbattle, if he could be induced to stand his ground. But matters must\r\nnot be pressed till the Army of the Centre, which had only started from\r\nMadrid on the 6th, should come up into line; and some of the divisions\r\nof the Army of the South were still far to the rear, having halted\r\nabout Villacastin and Arevalo. Accordingly, it was not till the 10th\r\nthat Wellington saw any serious force accumulating before the Salamanca\r\npositions, and even then it was the advanced guard alone of the enemy\r\nwhich had arrived. On the 9th Soult’s head-quarters were at Peñaranda,\r\nthose of the King at Flores de Avila, those of Souham at Villaruela.\r\nOn the 10th Soult was in person before Alba de Tormes, but had only\r\nhis cavalry and two infantry divisions in hand; the rest were still in\r\nthe rear. The Army of the Centre had its vanguard at Macotera; that of\r\nthe Army of Portugal had reached Babilafuente[156]. The troops were\r\nmuch tried by the weather, and those of Soult’s army in particular\r\nwere feeling their privations. They had been almost continually on the\r\nmarch since September, having halted but a few days on the borders\r\nof Valencia. The bitter November cold of the plateau of Old Castile\r\nwas felt almost unbearable by men who had been for three years lodged\r\nin Andalusia, whose climate is almost sub-tropical and never suffers\r\nthe extremes that are usual in Northern Spain[157]. Soult’s Army,\r\ntoo, had the worst roads during the last days of the advance, and its\r\ncommissariat arrangements had gone wrong, while little could be gleaned\r\nfrom the countryside. The horses began to fail, and stragglers to drop\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th Soult resolved to see whether Wellington was disposed to\r\nhold Alba de Tormes, or whether the detachment there would blow up the\r\nbridge and retire when attacked. Operations began by the driving in of\r\nthe pickets of Long’s Light Dragoons, who had been kept as far forward\r\nas possible till the last moment. They lost a few men in retiring.\r\nSoult then placed three batteries on the hill to the east of the town,\r\nand commenced to shell it at about two o’clock in the afternoon;\r\nshortly afterwards twelve voltigeur companies of the Fifth Division\r\ndeployed in long lines, and began to press up towards the place, taking\r\nevery possible advantage of cover, while the heavy columns of the\r\nregiments to which they belonged, and of Daricau’s division in support,\r\nwere visible in the rear.\r\n\r\nAlba was held by Howard’s brigade of the 2nd Division (1/50th, 1/71st,\r\n1/92nd); on the other side of the water, as a reserve, were Hamilton’s\r\nPortuguese (2nd, 4th, 10th, and 14th Line) and the batteries of Arriaga\r\nand Braun, placed in a position from which they could flank any attacks\r\non the bridge. The town had been prepared for defence, the gaps in its\r\nwalls having been filled up with rough palisading, and its non-existent\r\ngates built up with barricades of stone and timber. Each of the three\r\nBritish regiments held one-third of the circumference of the wall,\r\nwith half its companies in firing-line and the others in reserve\r\nunder shelter. From two till five, when dusk fell, Soult continued to\r\nbatter the town; but ‘notwithstanding the shower of shot and shell\r\nwhich plunged and danced about the streets in every direction[158]’\r\nthe losses of the defenders were quite moderate: they had been given\r\ntime on the 9th to extemporize good shelter with barricades and\r\ntraverses, and kept under cover. Thrice during the afternoon the lines\r\nof voltigeurs, who had thrown themselves into the ravines and ditches\r\naround the walls, received orders to charge in; but on each occasion\r\nthe bickering fire which they had hitherto received burst out into a\r\nblaze as they approached the walls, and their losses were so great that\r\nthey had to run back into cover. Hamilton reinforced the garrison at\r\ndusk with two of Da Costa’s Portuguese battalions (of the 2nd and 14th\r\nLine). At nightfall the French had accomplished absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nNext morning at dawn (about 6 o’clock) the cannonade recommenced,\r\nand the French skirmishers once more pushed up towards the walls. Da\r\nCosta’s light companies were used against them, as well as those of\r\nthe three British battalions. But the attack was not pressed home,\r\nand after a few hours Soult desisted: the guns were drawn off, the\r\ninfantry retired. The Marshal wrote to King Joseph that it was no use\r\npressing on: he had thrown 1,500 shot into the place without effect: by\r\npersisting ‘_nous y perdrions du monde sans résultat_[159].’ Wellington\r\nhad to be attacked, but the way to reach him was certainly--as it\r\nappeared--not to be over the bridge of Alba. From the 11th to the\r\n14th Howard’s and da Costa’s brigades held the place without further\r\nmolestation. Their modest casualty list, on the afternoon of the\r\n10th and the morning hours of the 11th, had been 21 men killed and 3\r\nofficers and 89 men wounded: 8 killed and 36 wounded were Portuguese.\r\nThe 1/92nd with 38 men hit was the battalion that suffered most[160].\r\nThe French loss had been a little greater--apparently 2 officers killed\r\nand 6 wounded[161], with some 150 casualties in the rank and file: the\r\n45th Ligne with 5 officers hurt contributed the largest total to the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe cannonade at Alba settled nothing: on its second day the French\r\ncommanders were taking counsel together, Soult, the King, Jourdan,\r\nwith Souham and Clausel (representing the Army of Portugal) were all\r\nriding up and down the eastern bank of the Tormes, and seeking for the\r\nfacts which must determine their next move[162]. Fortunately for the\r\nhistorian, after the debate, which was long and indecisive, Jourdan and\r\nSoult each wrote a formal letter of advice to the King that evening. On\r\none point only were they agreed: it would be mad to attack Wellington\r\non the position of San Cristobal, whose strength was well known to all\r\nthe officers of the Army of Portugal, and had been increased during\r\nthe last two days by the throwing up of a chain of redoubts armed with\r\nartillery. There remained two plans--Jourdan’s was a proposal to force\r\nthe line of the Tormes between Huerta and Alba, by a frontal attack\r\nacross the numerous fords which Marmont had used in the campaign of the\r\nprevious July; Soult’s was a plan for turning Wellington’s right by\r\ngoing some distance up-stream south of Alba, and utilizing the fords\r\nof the Tormes between Alba and Salvatierra. In the main the question\r\nturned on the practicability of the fords, and this was varying from\r\nhour to hour. The rain, which had made Hill’s retreat and Soult’s\r\nadvance so miserable to the troops, had stopped for the moment, and\r\nthe river was falling. Of the numerous passages about Huerta, La\r\nEncina and Villa Gonzalo, Wellington had considered on the 9th that\r\nnone were really practicable: on the 10th he wrote to Hill that ‘the\r\nriver has certainly fallen since yesterday evening, but I believe that\r\nno infantry soldier can pass yet, even if a cavalry soldier can, and\r\nsmall picquets guarding the fords and charging resolutely the first\r\nmen who pass, will effectually prevent the passage[163].’ Hill was not\r\nso certain that the enemy could not force his way over the river, and\r\non the 11th Wellington conceded that some of the fords had certainly\r\nbecome practicable for cavalry, if not for infantry[164]. Considering\r\nthe immense superiority of the French in the mounted arm, it was\r\nconceivable that they might attack many fords at once, drive in the\r\ninferior cavalry-screen of the Allies, and then throw bridges across\r\nand attack the British centre. In that case the army would stand to\r\nfight, not behind the river bank but in front of the position of the\r\nArapiles. It would be necessary to close in the flanks for a battle;\r\nall or most of the troops on the San Cristobal position would cross\r\nthe Tormes, just as they had done in July, and at the same time Hill\r\nwould draw in from Alba and form the southern wing of the line, in\r\nthe woods which had sheltered Marmont’s beaten army on the night of\r\nthe great victory. But Alba was not to be abandoned[165]: its castle\r\nwas susceptible of a long defence, and effectually blocked the best\r\npassage of the Tormes. Wellington selected a battalion of Galician\r\ninfantry (Monterey, under Major José Miranda) which was to be placed\r\nin the castle, and to hold it as long as possible, even when it should\r\n(as was inevitable) be cut off from the allied army by the advance\r\nof the French. The position was explained to the Spanish major, who\r\n(as we shall see) behaved most admirably, blocked the Alba line of\r\ncommunication for many days, and finally escaped by a sudden sally from\r\nwhat looked like an inevitable surrender.\r\n\r\nThe two plans which were submitted to King Joseph on the evening\r\nof November 11 both presupposed the practicability of the fords of\r\nthe Tormes. The river must evidently have fallen considerably since\r\nWellington surveyed it on the 9th, and drew his conclusion that it was\r\na barrier not to be crossed by any body of troops, but at most passable\r\nby individual horsemen.\r\n\r\nJourdan wrote: ‘When we arrived on the heights above the right bank\r\nof the Almar, Your Majesty was struck with the advantages that the\r\nground presented. I myself at once conceived the hope of forcing the\r\nEnglish Army to a general action which must involve its destruction.\r\nWellington’s position is too long--extending from the heights of San\r\nCristobal on the right bank of the Tormes as far as Alba. The Imperial\r\nArmy could pass the river at almost any spot between Huerta and the\r\npoint where the Almar flows into the Tormes. The immense plain on the\r\nopposite bank would permit the whole of our cavalry to cross and form\r\nup in front, to protect the passage of our infantry. After that, the\r\nArmy would march in mass against the English centre (which appears\r\nto be between Calvarisa de Abaxo and Calvarisa de Arriba), and would\r\nbreak through the enemy’s line. I do not disguise from myself that the\r\npiercing of the hostile centre has its difficulties, but I should think\r\nthat 80,000 French troops could surmount them. Your Majesty must have\r\nremarked that Soult, who at first was all for marching toward the upper\r\nTormes, was struck with the advantages which this ground offered, and\r\ncame round to my opinion. But subsequently he got talking with General\r\nClausel, about the plan for marching up the river, and returned to\r\nhis first view, which he induced Clausel to support. Both of them are\r\nacquainted with the localities over which they wish to move the armies,\r\nwhich gives weight to their opinion. I do not wish to deny that Soult’s\r\nproposition is the more prudent, and if we want to fight we ought to\r\ndo so on ground which Wellington has not chosen, and which is less\r\nadvantageous to the enemy than that which he now occupies. But I fear\r\nthat we should not obtain from this movement so much advantage as Soult\r\nappears to expect.\r\n\r\n‘For he seems to think that Wellington will be forced to retreat on\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, while it is quite possible that he may choose to\r\nretreat on San Felices, in which case our movement to the upper Tormes\r\ncompels him to retire indeed, but enables him to avoid a battle. For my\r\npart I think that our superior numbers make a general action desirable.\r\nI conclude, then, that Your Majesty may adopt Soult’s proposition so\r\nfar as the movement up the Tormes goes. If so, I believe that the Army\r\nof Portugal must follow the Army of the South. The enemy has all his\r\nforces united: it would be too dangerous for us to divide ours[166].’\r\n\r\nSoult’s letter of the evening of the 12th, to the King, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n‘The passage which we reconnoitred a little below Villa Gonzalo unites\r\nall the qualities which one could desire, and I should be in favour\r\nof it, were it not for the fact that after debouching on this point\r\nwe should have to form up for the attack under the fire of the enemy,\r\nand should be compelled immediately to assail his whole army, in a\r\nposition which he knows and has thought out, and where very probably\r\nhe has entrenched himself. I think, therefore, that it would be more\r\nprudent and more advantageous to force him to shift his position, and\r\nto commit himself to an action on ground which we and not he will have\r\nchosen--or else to retreat[167]. I have sent three officers along the\r\nupper Tormes: they have reconnoitred and found practicable three fords\r\nbetween Exeme and Galisancho[167].’\r\n\r\nFrom the comparison of these two interesting dispatches we see that\r\nJourdan desired a battle in the style of Wagram, where the attacking\r\narmy crosses a river, and breaks through the over-long line of an\r\nenemy deployed along heights at some distance from the water’s edge.\r\nBut Soult (to use an anachronism) feared a battle in the style of\r\nFredericksburg, where the assailant, debouching from narrow fords or\r\nbridges, attacks in heavy masses a well-prepared position, held by\r\nan enemy who has had time to settle down comfortably into it, and to\r\nentrench the most suitable points. Soult was eminently justified in his\r\ncriticism of Jourdan’s plan: the most noteworthy remark to be made upon\r\nit is that this was the battle which Wellington wanted. He wished to be\r\nattacked frontally by the fords between Alba and Huerta, and had made\r\nall his arrangements. On the other hand, Jourdan’s criticism of Soult\r\nwas equally cogent. If the French armies, keeping in a mass, crossed\r\nthe upper Tormes far above Alba, Wellington had the choice between\r\nfighting in a new position (e. g. behind the river Zurgain), and\r\nabsconding, before his flank should be threatened seriously. He could,\r\nindeed, move off, practically unmolested, towards Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nnot merely (as Jourdan suggested) by the more northern line toward San\r\nFelices and Almeida.\r\n\r\nJoseph, as was perhaps natural, gave his final decision in favour of\r\nSoult’s plan. It was true that he had a marked superiority in numbers,\r\nand that a defeat of a crushing sort inflicted on Wellington would go\r\nfar to end the Peninsular War. No such army on the French side had ever\r\nbeen in line on a single field before in Spain. Jourdan’s estimate of\r\n80,000 men was a decided understatement, even allowing for the fact\r\nthat Soult’s divisions had already many stragglers, and that Souham\r\nhad left a ‘minimum’ garrison at Valladolid. Something much more like\r\nthe 90,000 men at which Wellington estimated the three united French\r\narmies must have been collected[168]. On the other hand there is a\r\ndreadful risk taken when an army endeavours to cross a group of fords,\r\nsupplemented at the best by some hastily constructed bridges, in face\r\nof an enemy known to be wary, active, and determined. What might not\r\nhappen if Wellington fell upon the leading divisions, while the rest\r\nwere crowding down to their crossing points? Or who could guarantee\r\nthat sudden rain in the Sierra de Francia might not cause the Tormes\r\nto rise three feet on the battle day, and separate the troops who had\r\ncrossed from those still on the eastern bank? Every one at the French\r\nhead-quarters must have remembered Essling, and the narrow escape from\r\nsupreme disaster there suffered from the caprice of the Danube.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the prospect of the enormous advantage to be got by\r\ninflicting a complete disaster on Wellington did not balance the\r\npossibility of loss that might follow an unsuccessful frontal attack\r\nupon his position. Joseph made his choice in favour of Soult’s plan for\r\na flank march to the upper Tormes. This manœuvre would take several\r\ndays to execute, as the Army of the South had to be moved to its left\r\nfrom all its cantonments facing Alba, while the Armies of the Centre\r\nand Portugal had to wait till this flank march was finished, in order\r\nto come up and take over the former positions of Soult’s divisions. For\r\nall the French chiefs were agreed that the armies must keep closed up,\r\nand that no gap must be allowed to come into existence between them.\r\nWhen the Army of the South should begin to cross the Tormes, the Army\r\nof Portugal must be in direct support of it, and must make no separate\r\nattack of its own to the north of Alba, in the localities which Jourdan\r\nhad found so tempting. The whole of the 12th and 13th November was\r\nexpended in making this shift of troops southward. Soult moved his\r\narmy up-stream and placed his head-quarters at Anaya, six miles south\r\nof Alba, above the fords of Galisancho, where the crossing was to take\r\nplace. The King moved to Valdecarros, a little to Soult’s right, with\r\nthe Army of the Centre. The Army of Portugal, leaving its cavalry and\r\ntwo infantry divisions[169] as a rearguard about Huerta, moved the\r\nother six to the heights above Alba, where it was hoped that it might\r\ncross, when Soult’s manœuvre should force Hill to abandon that place\r\nand draw back.\r\n\r\nThe King took two unexpected measures before passing the Tormes. The\r\nfirst was to supersede Souham as commander of the Army of Portugal--the\r\nexcuse used was that he was indisposed, and not up to his task: the\r\nreal cause was that he was considered to have shown tardiness and\r\nover-caution in his manœuvres since October 30th.[170] Drouet was\r\ntaken from the command of the Army of the Centre, and given the more\r\nimportant charge of that of Portugal. The other, and more surprising,\r\norder was one which made over--as a temporary arrangement--the charge\r\nof the Army of the Centre to Soult, who thus had nearly 60,000 men\r\nput at his disposition. The object was, apparently, to give him ample\r\nforces for the move now about to be made at his request, and on his\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWellington was evidently somewhat puzzled at the posture of the French\r\non the 12th-13th November. He could not make out any reduction of\r\nthe French forces between Huerta and Alba, where indeed the whole\r\nArmy of Portugal still lay, but now with an accumulation of forces\r\non its left and a weaker right. Yet so long as the enemy was still\r\nin force at Huerta he could not evacuate the San Cristobal position,\r\nin order to send reinforcements to Hill. Reconnaissances by French\r\ncavalry above Alba were reported each day by outlying picquets of\r\nHamilton’s Portuguese, who were watching the course of the upper\r\nTormes[171]. But no solid force was sent to back these outlying\r\nposts: Wellington considered it unsafe to extend his already lengthy\r\nfront. The disposition of the troops on his right wing was still that\r\nHill lay in the woods behind Alba, with the 3rd and 4th Divisions at\r\nCalvarisa de Abaxo as a reserve for him, while Long’s and D’Urban’s\r\ncavalry carefully watched the course of the river from Alba to opposite\r\nHuerta. On the north of the Tormes Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese\r\nwere on the river-bank at Aldea Lengua and Cabrerizos, watching the\r\ntwo French divisions at Huerta. The 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th Divisions and\r\nthe Galicians held the San Cristobal position, with Anson’s, Victor\r\nAlten’s, and Ponsonby’s cavalry far out in their front. Nothing hostile\r\ncould be discovered in this direction nearer than the two divisions\r\nof the Army of Portugal at Huerta. Yet Wellington did not like to\r\nweaken his left flank: at any moment the enemy at Huerta might come\r\nforward, and might prove to be the vanguard of an advancing army, not\r\nthe rearguard of one about to go off southward. This hypothesis seemed\r\nall the more possible because Maucune, on the morning of the 12th, had\r\nmade a reconnaissance in force against Pack’s Portuguese, at Aldea\r\nLengua: he deployed three brigades, engaged in a lively skirmish, and\r\nonly retreated when British reinforcements began to come up. On the\r\nfollowing day Wellington, wishing to see whether Maucune was on the\r\nmove, beat up his quarters with strong reconnaissances of cavalry, and\r\nfound him still in position[172]. Till Maucune should leave Huerta,\r\nin advance or retreat, the situation was not clear. For these two days,\r\nit seems, Wellington was still thinking it possible that he might be\r\nattacked either on the San Cristobal position or by the fords between\r\nHuerta and Alba. But he was quite aware that the other possibility (a\r\nflank movement of Soult by the upper Tormes) existed, and had sent a\r\nstaff officer with a party of the 13th Light Dragoons to cross the\r\nriver at Salvatierra and ascertain the southernmost point to which\r\nthe French had moved[173]. And he had given Hill elaborate orders as\r\nto what should be done if he were turned and driven in. Whether there\r\nwould be a battle to follow, or a retreat on Ciudad Rodrigo, depended\r\non the exact movements of the enemy, and the force that he brought up\r\nto the crucial point. If the French split themselves into many columns,\r\nwith long gaps between them, there was still a chance of administering\r\na second lesson like that of July 22nd on much the same ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Roads of the SALAMANCA ALMEIDA REGION illustrating\r\nthe SALAMANCA Retreat of November 1812]\r\n\r\nOn the early morning of the 14th the crisis came. At dawn Pierre\r\nSoult’s Light Cavalry crossed the Tormes in force at three fords\r\nbetween Galisancho and Lucinos, which were perfectly passable, the\r\nwater only coming up to the horses’ bellies. The Portuguese picquets\r\nbeyond the river gave the alarm, but had to retire at once; some few\r\nwere cut off by the chasseurs. Two divisions of dragoons followed\r\nVinot’s and Avy’s light horse, and when they had scoured the west bank\r\nof the Tormes up and down and found no enemy in force, the infantry\r\nbegan to pass, not only by the fords but by several trestle bridges\r\nwhich were constructed in haste. As soon as there were a couple of\r\ndivisions across the river, they advanced to a line of heights a couple\r\nof miles ahead, where there was a fair defensive position above the\r\nvillage of Martin Amor. By the afternoon the whole Army of the South\r\nwas across the water, and had taken up a more advanced line towards\r\nMozarbes, while the Army of the Centre was beginning to follow. It\r\nhad been hoped that the Army of Portugal would be able to cross at or\r\nnear Alba, for Soult supposed it likely that Hill would evacuate that\r\ntown, when he saw 40,000 men arrayed behind his left flank. But though\r\nHill did withdraw Howard’s and da Costa’s brigades in the afternoon,\r\nhe left Miranda’s Spanish battalion in the castle, and blew up the\r\nbridge. As the castle commanded the ruined structure and the ford near\r\nit, and fired furiously on both, there was no chance of passing here\r\nor of repairing the ruined arch. Drouet found that he would have to\r\nmarch up-stream, and made his crossing at Torrejon, four miles south\r\nof Alba and near the fords that Soult had employed. He had the bulk of\r\nhis army over the river by the afternoon, and his two rear divisions\r\nunder Maucune, which had arrived late after a forced march from Huerta,\r\ncrossed at dusk[174]. The whole 90,000 men of the French Army were over\r\nthe Tormes that night, bivouacking on the heights from Torradillos to\r\nValdenuerque, in front of Martin Amor. The operation had been neatly\r\ncarried out, and was quite successful.\r\n\r\nWellington had early knowledge of the French movement from two\r\nsources--his cavalry told him almost at daybreak that the French camps\r\nabove Huerta were empty, and soon after came Hill’s news that Soult\r\nhad begun to cross the Tormes in force at Galisancho. Quite early in\r\nthe morning Wellington rode out in haste, to take command in person\r\non the threatened front, after having issued orders that the whole of\r\nthe troops on the San Cristobal position should follow him. He himself\r\npushed on with his staff, met Hill in the wood south of the Arapiles,\r\nand told him to watch the roads from Alba with the 4th Division and\r\nHamilton’s Portuguese. Then, taking the strong 2nd Division--8,000\r\ninfantry--and all the cavalry brigades that had been watching the\r\nmiddle Tormes (Slade’s, Long’s, and D’Urban’s, and Penne Villemur’s\r\nSpaniards) he pushed on to ‘contain’ and possibly to attack Soult[175].\r\nBut on arriving in front of Mozarbes a little before noon, he saw that\r\nthe enemy had already three or four divisions and 4,000 horse drawn up\r\nin line to cover the passage of the Tormes by the rest of his army. He\r\nhad arrived too late to check Soult’s leading columns, and if he sent\r\nfor Hill and the other troops which lay to his rear, he would, even\r\nwhen they arrived, have only 25,000 men available to attack an enemy\r\nwho had already as great a force in line, and who was receiving fresh\r\ntroops every moment from the fords[176]. Nothing could be done till the\r\ngreat reserve from the San Cristobal position came up, and they were\r\nnot due till late in the day--the last of them indeed did not cross the\r\nbridge of Salamanca till the following morning.\r\n\r\nAt dusk Wellington ordered Hill to fall back with his infantry from the\r\nwoods in front of Alba to the old position of the Arapiles, but kept\r\nhis cavalry to the front, to cover his own line of battle as long as\r\npossible. Their screen of vedettes was placed in the line of woods from\r\nMiranda de Azan to Utrera, south of the heights on which Marmont’s army\r\nhad taken up its position upon July 22nd. Till this cavalry was driven\r\nin, the French, on the rising ground above Mozarbes, could not make out\r\nthe British position.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th Wellington had all his troops in hand,\r\nthough the last divisions from San Cristobal did not come up till some\r\nhours after daybreak. But the enemy had also brought up every man to\r\nthe front, being resolved to sacrifice not even the smallest part of\r\nhis numerical superiority. Some critics, among them Jourdan[177],\r\nhold that Wellington, since he was determined not to fight save at\r\nadvantage, should have commenced his retreat on Ciudad Rodrigo the\r\nmoment that he saw the whole of the three hostile armies massed in his\r\nfront, and before they could begin to debouch from their position on\r\nthe heights of Mozarbes. And it is probable that if he had directed the\r\ntroops from San Cristobal to take the roads towards the Agueda, instead\r\nof bringing them up to the Arapiles position, and if he had used Hill’s\r\ncorps and all his cavalry as a rearguard only, he would have reached\r\nCiudad Rodrigo with a smaller loss of life than was actually to be\r\nspent. The French would have had to start their pursuit from a more\r\ndistant and a less favourable point.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that Wellington was prepared to risk a battle, even\r\nagainst the superior numbers opposed to him, supposing that the enemy\r\nplayed his game badly. He resolved to take up the excellent position\r\nalong the Arapiles heights which he had held on July 22nd, and to stand\r\nto fight against any frontal assault--the advantage of the ground, with\r\nits bold slopes, good cover for reserves, and favourable emplacements\r\nfor artillery, were evidently in his eyes so great that he was prepared\r\nto risk a general engagement with 20,000 men less in line than had\r\nhis adversaries. As the morning drew on, he had his army formed up\r\nfrom Calvarisa de Arriba to a point not far from Miranda de Azan.\r\nThe line was longer than in the battle of July 22nd, for the troops\r\nwere much more numerous. The extreme left wing was formed by the 4th\r\nDivision holding the heights and village of Calvarisa de Arriba (which\r\nhad been in Foy’s hands on July 22). The 2nd Division and Hamilton’s\r\nPortuguese were holding both the Arapiles--the French as well as the\r\nEnglish--and the ground from thence as far as the village of the same\r\nname. Westward of Hill’s troops lay the 3rd Division and Morillo’s\r\nSpaniards. The second line, composed of troops which had come down from\r\nSan Cristobal, consisted of the Light Division (on the left), Pack and\r\nBradford, the Galicians, and the 5th, 6th, and 7th Divisions. The 1st\r\nDivision was placed as a somewhat ‘refused’ right flank protection\r\nfor the whole army--much as Pakenham and the 3rd Division had been in\r\nJuly. It lay about Aldea Tejada on the Zurgain river, several miles\r\nto the right rear of the 3rd Division. The object for which it was\r\ndetailed to this separate duty was the same as that for which Pakenham\r\nhad been told off at the earlier crisis--to protect the Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nroad, and to be ready to outflank and intercept any attempt which the\r\nFrench might make to turn the British position in this direction. The\r\nbulk of the cavalry was also placed on the right wing, to cover the\r\nend of the infantry line. Only the Portuguese horse of D’Urban and\r\nCampbell, Penne Villemur’s Spaniards, and Long’s brigade were on the\r\nleft beyond Calvarisa de Arriba. The rest, five British brigades, lay\r\nout in the direction of Miranda de Azan and in front of Aldea Tejada.\r\nBock’s brigade on the extreme right long remembered their position of\r\nthis morning because they were placed on ‘Pakenham’s Hill’, the spot\r\nwhere the 3rd Division had fallen upon Thomières in the old battle.\r\nThe ground was thickly strewn with the skeletons of the French who had\r\nthen fallen, still lying unburied and in a horrible state of complete\r\npreservation: the horses’ hoofs were continually setting the skulls\r\nrolling[178]. Behind Bock were Ponsonby’s, Victor Alten’s, Anson’s,\r\nand Slade’s brigades, a formidable mass, yet far less in strength\r\nthan the innumerable cavalry of the Armies of the South and Centre,\r\nwhich lay opposite them 7,000 strong[179]. Nothing was more uncertain\r\nthan the move which the French would next make. If it should turn out\r\nto be one which did not fit in with Wellington’s plans, there would\r\nbe no alternative but a retreat on Ciudad Rodrigo. Wherefore all the\r\ndivisions were directed to send off their baggage half a march to the\r\nwest, and preparations were made to destroy so much of the magazines in\r\nSalamanca city as could not be carried off. The commissariat officers\r\nwere already packing up all for which transport could be found, and\r\nsending it forward. By an error of judgement on the part of the\r\nQuartermaster-General, James Willoughby Gordon--not the first of his\r\nblunders in this campaign--all this valuable store was started on the\r\nroad Salamanca-Rollan-San Felices, which was the safest by far of all\r\nthose open to the Army if a retreat should become necessary, and the\r\nfarthest from any probable line of advance that the French could take.\r\nBut it had the disadvantage of being far away from the other roads by\r\nwhich the Allied Army might have to move, and the unfortunate result\r\nfollowed on the 16th-17th-18th that the food was moving on the northern\r\nroad, and the troops--starving for want of it--on three other roads\r\nparallel to it at a distance of twenty miles to the south. Soldiers\r\nmust be fed, or they straggle and turn to marauding, and it is of\r\nno profit to have food if it be not in the right place at the right\r\nmoment. These simple facts were to cause dire trouble during the next\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, from a comparatively early hour on the 15th it became\r\nevident that Soult was not going to play the game that Wellington\r\ndesired. It was a miserable morning of drifting rain, and\r\nreconnaissances had to be pushed far forward to get any clear\r\ninformation. But the reports soon began to come in, to the effect that\r\nthe enemy was keeping closed up, that he was constructing trenches and\r\n_abattis_ on the heights of Mozarbes[180] and that he had pushed out\r\nan immense force of cavalry on his left wing, under cover of which\r\ninfantry divisions were clearly to be seen working westward. Evidently\r\nSoult was aiming at the roads toward Ciudad Rodrigo; but he was not\r\n(like Marmont on July 22) letting his army break up into unconnected\r\nsections, and was keeping it in an unbroken line. The entrenchments\r\non the hills showed that he was prepared to receive in position any\r\nfrontal attack that Wellington might be prepared to direct against\r\nhim. His motions were slow, not only because of his cautious method of\r\nprocedure, but from the badness of the country roads, already made deep\r\nand miry from the rain, over which he was moving his left wing towards\r\nthe west. The Army of Portugal was now in line on his right, and its\r\ncavalry was feeling its way forward towards Hill’s flank. But obviously\r\nthe danger was not on this side, where the bulk of the French infantry\r\nwas standing fast in position: it was the other wing, Soult’s troops\r\nalone, which was in decided motion, and that for a flank march, not for\r\nanything approaching a frontal attack.\r\n\r\nAll this was most disappointing: Wellington at once made up his mind\r\nthat since the enemy was not about to attack his position, and since\r\nit would be madness on his part to take the offensive and assail the\r\nwell-placed array of the French, there was no alternative save instant\r\nretreat. It must not be delayed, because, when Soult should have moved\r\nhis left wing a little farther on, he would be controlling the road\r\nthat runs from Mozarbes to Tamames and Ciudad Rodrigo, parallel to\r\nthat via Matilla and San Muñoz to the same destination, over which\r\nWellington’s natural line of retreat lay.\r\n\r\nAt about two o’clock in the afternoon on the 15th the British\r\ncommander-in-chief made up his mind that he must delay no longer, and\r\nordered his army to march to its right, in the two lines in which it\r\nwas already arranged. The mass of cavalry in front of Aldea Tejada\r\nremained stationary, to cover the movement of the infantry behind its\r\nrear: the smaller body of horse on the left held its ground about the\r\nArapiles, till all the divisions had passed on, and then followed as\r\na rearguard. The entire army marched in fighting trim: if attacked\r\nat any moment it had only to front to its left flank, and then would\r\nbe in order of battle. The movement had to be slow for the first few\r\nmiles, since neither the front nor the rear column was on a good\r\ntrack until it reached the river Zurgain, and there fell into one of\r\nthe three parallel roads which run from Salamanca to Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\nMoreover the rain, which had been a mere drizzle in the morning, turned\r\nto a heavy torrential downpour just as the army was starting. The\r\ncountry paths became quagmires in a few minutes; and when the usually\r\ninsignificant Zurgain came in sight it was already a roaring river,\r\nonly to be forded with care. The march was toilsome in the extreme,\r\nand the troops, who had expected and desired a general action, were\r\nsodden and sulky. ‘I never saw the men in such a bad humour,’ observes\r\none intelligent eye-witness[181]. The march was absolutely unmolested\r\nby the French, and the columns, having crossed the Zurgain, fell into\r\nthe three parallel roads which run side by side for many miles from\r\nSalamanca--the southern one to Matilla, the central one to Maza de\r\nSan Pedro and San Muñoz, the northern one (the so-called Calzada de\r\nDon Diego) to Aldehuela de la Boveda[182]. Of these the second is\r\nthe regular high road from Salamanca to the frontier, the other two\r\nsecondary lines of communication. They are extraordinarily convenient\r\nfor the retreat of an army which must be kept together, the distance\r\nbetween the two side-roads and the central one being seldom over five\r\nmiles, and often no more than three. The only misfortune was that the\r\ntrain of transport had gone off, by Colonel Gordon’s error[183], on an\r\nentirely different and divergent route, towards Rollan and San Felices.\r\nThe army, after falling into the designated roads, pursued its way till\r\nafter dark and bivouacked in the patches of forest on the farther side\r\nof the Valmusa river, about 10 miles from Salamanca. The head-quarters\r\nwere at the village of Carnero on the central road[184]. The night was\r\nmiserable, no food was distributed, and though wood was abundant it was\r\nhard to light fires, owing to the incessant rain. The troops were tired\r\nand footsore, and straggling had once more begun.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was quite as much discontent in the French ranks as\r\nin those of Wellington. There had been a general feeling that since\r\nthe whole force of the three armies of the South, Centre, and Portugal\r\nhad been successfully concentrated on the Mozarbes position, and since\r\nthe enemy was known to be much inferior in numbers, something decisive\r\nought to have happened on the 15th November. That no collision whatever\r\ntook place must be attributed partly to the bad weather, but much more\r\nto the caution of Soult, who was this day determined above all things\r\nthat he would not suffer the fate of Marmont on this same ground, by\r\nallowing any dislocation to take place between the various sections of\r\nhis army.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock in the morning it had been reported that--so far as the\r\nmisty rain allowed of certain observation--Wellington was in line of\r\nbattle on the Arapiles position. Soult continued to move his cavalry\r\nforward with caution, and to extend his left towards Azan. A little\r\nbefore noon Joseph and Jourdan joined Soult on the heights above\r\nMozarbes, the Allies being still stationary. Jourdan suggested that\r\nthe Army of Portugal should move forward on the right and attack that\r\nflank of the hostile line which rested on the Arapiles[185]: this was\r\ntried in a tentative way, apparently with the object of holding Hill’s\r\ndivisions to their ground, and preventing them from moving off. But it\r\nled to no more than some bickering between the caçadores of the 2nd\r\nDivision and the advanced light cavalry and voltigeurs of the French\r\nright, in the woods south of the greater Arapile. The Army of Portugal\r\nmade no real attempt to close in. A partial attack on Wellington’s line\r\nwould, indeed, have been unwise. The only chance would have been for\r\nSoult to march in upon its right while D’Erlon was pressing in with\r\ndecision against its left. But Soult, though requested by King Joseph\r\nto move forward in force, continued his cautious flanking movement\r\nto the westward, and did not carry out a precise and definite order\r\nto push out his cavalry and drive in the British squadrons which lay\r\nin front of Wellington’s right. Then came the torrential rain which\r\nset in about two o’clock, just as Wellington ordered his army to move\r\noff, still preserving its battle order, toward the river Zurgain.\r\nHis departure was only partially visible, and no attempt was made to\r\nincommode it. A cavalry officer of the Army of the South writes: ‘The\r\nrain falling in deluge soon rendered the whole field of operations\r\none vast and deep quagmire. The smallest dips in the ground became\r\ndangerous precipices. The darkness, continually growing blacker, soon\r\nadded to the horror of the scene, and made us absolutely unable to act.\r\nThe muskets of the infantry were no longer capable of being discharged.\r\nThe cavalry was not only unable to manœuvre, but even to advance on the\r\nslippery, sodden, and slimy soil.... We lay down on the field drenched\r\nby the rain, with the mud up to our knees[186].’\r\n\r\nJourdan says that it was pitch dark by four o’clock, the gloom of the\r\nterrible downpour melting early into the darkness of the night. There\r\nwas much recrimination between the French leaders. Joseph wrote to\r\nthe Minister of War that he tried to bring on decisive action between\r\neleven o’clock and two, and failed entirely by the fault of Soult. He\r\naccused him of deliberately wasting two hours by vain excuses, and\r\nsuggested that the real explanation of his sluggishness was that he\r\nknew the incapacity of his brother Pierre Soult, commanding the light\r\nhorse of the left wing, and thought that he would get matters into a\r\nmess if he were charged with the duty of pressing Wellington’s cavalry\r\nin front of him[187]. ‘He knows the extent of his brother’s capacity,\r\nand fears to compromise him. For this reason his light horse is always\r\nkept close in to the rest of the army, and never advances without being\r\nimmediately supported by the remainder of his cavalry, while the Duke\r\nof Dalmatia always marches himself in his brother’s company.’\r\n\r\nSuch a theory is, of course, quite insufficient to explain Soult’s\r\nreluctance to engage on this day. The simple fact was that, after\r\nAlbuera, he had a wholesome dread of attacking a British army in\r\nposition, if it could be avoided, and preferred to manœuvre it from its\r\nchosen ground, even if he thereby sacrificed the possibility of a great\r\nvictory, and secured only an illusory advantage.\r\n\r\nOn finding that Wellington had got off unmolested, and that Soult had\r\nmade no attempt to drive in the cavalry which was covering his retreat,\r\nKing Joseph, by Jourdan’s advice, issued orders which proved that both\r\nhe and his mentor thought that the game was up. Instead of setting\r\nevery man upon the track of the allied columns, Joseph ordered the\r\nwhole Army of Portugal, as well as his own Guard, to march upon the\r\ndeserted town of Salamanca, while Soult alone was permitted to pursue\r\nthe retreating foe. Now since the King was as much convinced as either\r\nof the Marshals that, if Wellington was to be brought to book, every\r\nman of the 90,000 French troops must be ready to attack him, it is\r\nclear that the order to the Army of Portugal to desist from the pursuit\r\nmeant that no general action was now to be hoped for. Jourdan could\r\nindulge in the malicious satisfaction of the adviser who, having seen\r\nhis counsel rejected, is able to say ‘I told you so!’ to his comrade,\r\nwhen bad luck has supervened. He had prophesied that, if Soult were\r\nallowed to try his flank move to the upper Tormes, Wellington would\r\nget off without harm[188]. This had now happened; it was judged that\r\na further pursuit by the whole army was useless, and the 40,000 men\r\nof the Army of Portugal and the Royal Guards were directed to seize\r\nSalamanca and halt there. Clearly if Soult’s 50,000 men went on, and\r\nWellington suddenly turned to bay, the pursuers could not dare to bring\r\nhim to action, since they would be much outnumbered. Evidently, all\r\nthat could now be hoped was that Soult might worry the rear of the\r\nretreating enemy, and pick up stragglers and baggage.\r\n\r\nAfter dark the light cavalry of the Army of Portugal and Foy’s infantry\r\ndivision marched on Salamanca, and reached it that night, after much\r\ntoilsome trudging over inundated paths: ‘The plain was under water:\r\nfor half the way our infantry were walking through water knee deep:\r\nif the moon had not risen we should never have found our way there.’\r\nThe bridge of Salamanca was discovered to be unbroken, and some\r\nhalf-emptied magazines of flour and rum were captured. A rearguard\r\nof British cavalry--half a troop of the 2nd Hussars of the German\r\nLegion--evacuated the place on the arrival of the French, covering a\r\nmass of stragglers, sutlers, and Spanish refugees, who found their\r\nway to Ledesma and from thence to the Portuguese frontier[189]. Foy,\r\nfollowing them forty-eight hours later, moved to Ledesma, and then\r\nto Zamora, where he took up cantonments. The cavalry of the Army of\r\nPortugal, starting earlier, went to feel for Wellington’s rear on\r\nthe road towards Aldehuela de la Boveda, leaving the pursuit on the\r\nother two routes to Soult. The rest of the Army remained cantoned at\r\nSalamanca, which had been well plundered by the first division that\r\narrived[190]. King Joseph reviewed it, outside the city, on November\r\n17--all in the rain--a melancholy ceremony. The men and officers were\r\nalike weary and discontented. ‘We had an army stronger by a third than\r\nWellington’s, infinitely superior in cavalry and artillery. Confident\r\nexpectation of victory was in every man’s head. The chance had come\r\nof beating the English--perhaps of driving them from the Peninsula.\r\nThis fine opportunity, so splendid, so decisive, with so few adverse\r\nchances, has been let slip[191].’ So wrote the disappointed Foy. He\r\nadds, ‘The King does not know how to show to advantage before his\r\ntroops; he can speak with effect neither to the officers nor to the\r\nrank and file: he got absolutely wet through, rode home, and went to\r\nbed.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFROM THE TORMES TO THE AGUEDA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last crisis of the campaign of 1812 was now over, and, but for two\r\nunlucky circumstances, the four days of operations which still remained\r\nwould have required little notice from the annalist. But these two\r\nmishaps, the continuance of the exceptionally severe and tempestuous\r\nweather which had set in upon the 15th November, and the misdirection\r\nof the supply column, which had got completely separated from the\r\nmarching troops, were to have most disastrous results. They cost the\r\narmy 3,000 men, much misery, and some humiliation, and Wellington great\r\nvexation of spirit, leading to one of his rare outbursts of violent\r\nrage--his angry words committed to paper, and published abroad by\r\nmisadventure, were always remembered with a grudge by his officers and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that there was no really dangerous pursuit. Soult\r\nwas not strong enough to press Wellington to a general action, and knew\r\nit. On the 16th he wrote to King Joseph: ‘I think that your Majesty’s\r\nintention is that the enemy should only be followed up to the frontier.\r\nIn two days the campaign will probably be at an end in these parts,\r\nfor if the enemy’s army goes behind the Agueda, I cannot think that it\r\nwould be at present possible to pursue it any further. I await your\r\norders for the future destination of the Army of the South, which would\r\nbe unable to stop two days in position for want of bread and forage. I\r\npropose to establish it on the upper Tormes, below Salvatierra and El\r\nBarco, where I could rest eight or ten days, to allow the men repose\r\nand to collect food[192].’ Clearly there was no offensive spirit in the\r\nMarshal, who only wished to see Wellington upon his way to Rodrigo, and\r\nthen contemplated turning back to the upper Tormes.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th there was little to record in the way of military\r\noperations. The British Army started at dawn from its wet bivouacks\r\nbehind the Valmusa river, having received no distribution of food. The\r\nside roads, on which the larger part of the troops were moving, grew\r\nworse and worse as the rain continued. The weakly men began to fall\r\nbehind, the shirkers to slip away into the woods, to look for peasants\r\nto plunder and roofs to shelter them from the drenching rain. After the\r\nusual midday halt the bad news went round that the supply column had\r\ngone off on the wrong road--via Ledesma--and that there would again be\r\nno distribution of rations that evening. All that the troops got was\r\nthe carrion-like meat of over-driven bullocks hastily slaughtered, and\r\nacorns gathered in the oak woods through which the roads ran. These,\r\nwe are assured, though bitter and hard, were better than nothing. It\r\nwas only in the evening, after the infantry had encamped behind the\r\nbrook that gets its name from the village of Matilla, that the pursuing\r\nFrench cavalry came up on the two southern roads, and engaged in a\r\nbickering skirmish with the screen of allied horse covering the rear.\r\nThe Polish Lancers, 2nd Hussars, and 5th and 27th Chasseurs engaged\r\nin an interchange of partial charges with the 14th Light Dragoons and\r\nK.G.L. Hussars of Victor Alten’s brigade, in front of the camps of the\r\n2nd Division. It was brought to a sudden end by the light company of\r\nthe 28th and two guns opening fire on the French from under the cover\r\nof a woodside, on which the enemy went off, with a loss of some 50 men,\r\nmostly wounded prisoners[193]. Alten’s brigade suffered much less.\r\nThe centre column saw very little of the pursuing French--Digeon’s\r\nDragoons--who made no attempt to press in. The cavalry of the Army\r\nof Portugal acted even more feebly on the northernmost of the three\r\nparallel roads. Yet the retreating army lost several hundred ‘missing’\r\nthis day, all stragglers or weakly men captured singly on the road,\r\nor in villages at its sides, whither they had betaken themselves for\r\nshelter or marauding. The rearguard cavalry vainly attempted to whip\r\nthem all into the tail of the retreating column--some were really\r\nunable to move--others escaped notice in hiding-places, and were taken\r\nby the French when they emerged for a tardy attempt to follow the army.\r\nThe camp-followers, and the unfortunate women and children whom the\r\nevil custom of the time allowed to remain with the regiments, suffered\r\nmost of all. Soult in his dispatch to King Joseph of the night of the\r\n16th says that he had gathered in 600 prisoners this day, and is very\r\nprobably correct.\r\n\r\nThe 17th November was an even worse day--the rain still continued to\r\nfall, and stomachs were still more empty than on the preceding morning.\r\nThe march of the retreating army was still in three columns, but the\r\n2nd Division replaced the 4th as the rearguard of the southern column\r\n(2nd, 3rd, 4th Divisions; Hamilton’s Portuguese; Morillo’s Spaniards),\r\nwhich marched unmolested from Matilla by Villalba to Anaya on the\r\nHuebra, turning off towards the end of the day from the high road to\r\nTamames[194], in order not to get too far from the central column,\r\nwhich was marching on San Muñoz: for Wellington intended to have his\r\nwhole army arrayed behind the Huebra, a good fighting position, that\r\nevening. This was a most miserable journey. ‘The effects of hunger and\r\nfatigue were even more visible than on the preceding day. A savage sort\r\nof desperation had taken possession of our minds, and those who lived\r\non the most friendly terms in happier times now quarrelled with each\r\nother, using the most frightful imprecations, on the slightest offence.\r\nA misanthropic spirit was in possession of every bosom. The streams\r\nwhich fell from the hills were swelled into rivers, which we had to\r\nwade, and many fell out, including even officers. It was piteous to see\r\nsome of the men, who had dragged their limbs after them with determined\r\nspirit, fall down at last among the mud, unable to proceed further,\r\nand sure of being taken prisoners if they escaped death. Towards night\r\nthe rain had somewhat abated, but the cold was excessive, and numbers\r\nwho had resisted the effect of hunger and fatigue with a hardy spirit\r\nwere now obliged to give way, and sank to the ground praying for death\r\nto deliver them from their misery. Some prayed not in vain, for next\r\nmorning before daylight, in passing from our halting-ground to the\r\nroad, I stumbled over several who had died in the night[195].’\r\n\r\nThe only food that the southern marching column got this day was\r\nprocured from the celebrated raid upon the swine, which so much enraged\r\nWellington. It is recorded in many 3rd and 4th Division diaries. The\r\nmain wealth of the peasantry of this forest region lay in their pigs,\r\nwhich had been driven into the heart of the woods, to hide them from\r\nthe passing armies. From some unknown cause a stampede broke out in one\r\nvast herd of the creatures, which ran across the road cutting through\r\nthe middle of the 3rd Division. The starving soldiers opened up a\r\nlively fusillade upon them, and whole battalions broke their ranks and\r\npursued them with the bayonet, cutting up the creatures before they\r\nwere dead, each man going off with a gory limb or rib. Many officers\r\nfarther to the rear thought from the firing that the French had cut\r\ninto the head of the column. Later in the day the same or another herd\r\ncharged the camp of a brigade of the 2nd Division, and gave many a\r\nhungry man an unexpected meal[196].\r\n\r\nThe southern column had no enemy but hunger and cold on the 17th,\r\nbut the experiences of the centre column were more military. This\r\ncorps, consisting of the 1st, 6th, 5th, 7th, Light Divisions, moving\r\nin that order, had a tiresome alarm before the rearguard had started\r\nin the morning from behind the Matilla brook. By some blunder--on\r\nthe part of Gordon the Quartermaster-General as was said[197]--the\r\ncovering cavalry marched off before the Light Division, the rear of\r\nthe infantry column, had left its ground. There was nothing but the\r\npicquets from the 95th Rifles between the camp, where the battalions\r\nwere just getting under arms, and two divisions of French Dragoons,\r\ncautiously advancing along the road and with their flanking parties out\r\nin the woods. There was barely time to form close column and start off\r\nbefore the enemy were riding in from all sides. They did not attempt\r\nto close, but while keeping their main body on the road, at a safe\r\ndistance, sent out many detached squadrons, along by-paths in the\r\nwoods, which from time to time came out unexpectedly not only upon the\r\nflank of the Light Division, acting as rearguard, but much farther up\r\nthe line, where the 7th Division, and the 5th in front of them, were\r\nmoving along the road to San Muñoz. Hardly any of the allied cavalry\r\nappeared to curb these incursions--the main body appears to have gone\r\noff too much to the south, in the direction of Hill’s column. Hence\r\ncame the extraordinary chance that small bodies of the French got into\r\nthe interval between the Light Division and the 7th, and even into that\r\nbetween the 7th Division and the 5th, though the troops themselves were\r\nall closed up and perfectly safe in their dense columns. Great part\r\nof the baggage of the 7th Division was intercepted and plundered by\r\none party. But the most tiresome incident was that a patrol of three\r\nmen from Vinot’s light cavalry captured the one-armed General Edward\r\nPaget, the newly-arrived second-in-command of the Army, as he was\r\nriding--accompanied by his Spanish servant alone--from the rear brigade\r\nof the 5th Division to the front brigade of the 7th, in order to bid\r\nthe latter close up rapidly. The French pounced on him out of a corner\r\nof the wood, and as he could not defend himself, and had no escort, he\r\nwas hurried off a prisoner, and it was some time before his absence was\r\nnoted[198]. A good many isolated soldiers were picked up in the same\r\nfashion by the French cavalry, before the central column emerged from\r\nthe woods and found itself above the broad ravine of the Huebra river,\r\nand the town of San Muñoz, in the late afternoon[199].\r\n\r\nThe whole column had been ordered to encamp on the farther side of the\r\nHuebra, on the plateau in front of Boadilla and Cabrillas, and each\r\ndivision as it passed the river made its way to the ground allotted\r\nto it. There was wood to be had in abundance, and fires were lit--the\r\nrain had abated in the afternoon--but there was little to cook. Again\r\nthere was no distribution save of beef from the droves of half-starved\r\noxen which accompanied the divisions, and acorns which turned out more\r\npalatable when roasted than when eaten raw.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division had just crossed the Huebra, and the Light Division\r\nand a few squadrons of cavalry alone were on the farther bank, when\r\na new turn was given to the day by the appearance of infantry behind\r\nthe French Dragoons, who had been following the retreating centre\r\ncolumn since dawn. Soult had at last succeeded in getting his leading\r\ndivision, that of Daricau, to the front. Hitherto the bad roads and\r\nthe fatigue of the long marches had prevented them from picking up\r\nthe cavalry of the advanced guard. The Marshal by no means intended\r\nto commit himself to a general action, but thought that he had the\r\nchance of falling upon the rear of Wellington’s retreating central\r\ncolumn, as it passed the defile of the Huebra. ‘I thought,’ he wrote\r\nthat evening to King Joseph, ‘that I might bring off a combat of\r\ninfantry, and a cavalry affair, to advantage, but had to give up the\r\nidea, and to limit my efforts to cannonading the masses of the English\r\nArmy across the Huebra. The enemy showed us 20,000 men in position,\r\nincluding 3,000 horse, and more than 20 guns--we could see other masses\r\ndebouching across the bridge of Castillejo de Huebra, and the glare of\r\ncamp fires announced the presence of more divisions on the plateau of\r\nCabrillas[200].’\r\n\r\nWhat happened at this rearguard action, whose details Soult slurs\r\nover, was that the Light Division, suddenly attacked by the French\r\ninfantry as it was about to cross the Huebra, had to throw out a strong\r\nskirmishing line to its rear, while the main column plunged down the\r\nravine and over the fords. Three companies of the 43rd and one of the\r\n95th[201] held back Daricau’s voltigeurs till their comrades had waded\r\nacross the water, and then had the dangerous task of withdrawing from\r\nthe woodside and rushing down to the fords sharply pursued. Soult\r\nshowed at first every sign of desiring to cross the Huebra in their\r\nwake, brought up four batteries to his side of the ravine, and began to\r\nplay upon the Light and 7th Divisions, which had formed up to defend\r\nthe passage. His skirmishers swarmed down to the river bank, under\r\ncover of the fire of the guns, engaged in a lively _tiraillade_ across\r\nthe rapid stream, and would certainly have attempted to cross if the\r\nreturn fire had not been as strong and rapid as their own. The 7th\r\nDivision, drawn up in three lines of brigades on the higher slopes, was\r\nmuch shelled by the French artillery, and would have suffered severely\r\nbut for the fact that the rain-sodden ground ‘swallowed the shot and\r\nsmothered the shells[202].’ It is an extraordinary fact that after\r\n‘four hours of standing up to the ankles in mud and water, completely\r\nexposed, having nothing to shelter us[203]’ the regiments in the front\r\nbrigade were hardly touched at all: the 68th had no loss whatever,\r\nthe 51st had one officer killed and eight men wounded, and the total\r\ncasualties in the division were under 30. Soult’s report that ‘notre\r\nfeu d’artillerie a été très meurtrier pour l’ennemi’ was plausible\r\nenough to any French officer watching the artillery practice, which was\r\ngood--but happened to be incorrect.\r\n\r\nAt dusk the firing ceased, and the French drew off from the river\r\nand encamped in the woods behind them, as did the Light and 7th\r\nDivisions on the opposite bank. The losses on both sides in this\r\nskirmish--sometimes called the combat of San Muñoz, sometimes the\r\ncombat of the Huebra--were very moderate. Daricau’s division had 226\r\ncasualties (mostly in the 21st Léger and 100th Line), and the French\r\ncavalry a few more. On the British side the Light and 7th Divisions\r\nand the cavalry of the rearguard lost 365 men--but this included 178\r\nprisoners not taken in action but individually as stragglers during the\r\nlong retreat through the woods since dawn[204]. In the actual fighting\r\nthe loss was only 2 officers and 9 men killed, and 4 officers and 90\r\nmen wounded in the British brigades, with 1 officer and 36 men killed\r\nand 2 officers and 43 men wounded in the Portuguese--a total of 187.\r\nNext morning it was expected that the French, having now several more\r\ninfantry divisions at the front, would make an attempt to force the\r\nline of the Huebra at dawn. Nothing of the kind happened. ‘Daylight\r\ncame at last,’ writes the cavalry officer in charge of the line of\r\nvedettes along the river, ‘the French drums beat, and the troops stood\r\nto arms. I took my place to observe their movements, and expected every\r\nmoment to see the columns leaving the camp for the different fords.\r\nBut no! after having had a good opportunity to observe their strength,\r\nand to see their cavalry water their horses, I witnessed with no small\r\nsatisfaction the whole, after remaining under arms about two hours,\r\ndisperse to their respective bivouacks[205].’ The pursuit was over.\r\n\r\nWellington, in short, had offered battle on the Huebra, on the evening\r\nof the 17th, and Soult had refused it, seeing that the bulk of the\r\nallied army was concentrated close behind that river, while his own\r\ninfantry divisions were still straggling up from the rear. Nor had\r\nhe any intention of following next day--he wrote to King Joseph that\r\n‘I told your Majesty that seeing the retreat of the enemy upon the\r\nAgueda well pronounced, and having no hope of being able to engage him\r\nin a general action before he has terminated his movement, I should\r\nput a limit to my pursuit after passing the Huebra, and should move\r\noff towards the upper Tormes, to enable the army to collect the food\r\nwhich it lacks.’ The regret expressed at being unable to force on a\r\nbattle was of course insincere. All that Soult did was to wait till the\r\nBritish rearguard had abandoned the line of the Huebra, and then move\r\nhis advanced cavalry to Cabrillas, from which some small reconnoitring\r\nparties pushed as far as the Yeltes river[206], and then came back,\r\nreporting that it was impossible to pass that flooded stream without\r\nbridges, and that the British were all across it. On the morning of the\r\n19th the whole French army retired eastward, marching by Tamames and\r\nLinares towards Salvatierra. The truth was that the French were by now\r\nsuffering almost as much from fatigue and want of food as the British.\r\nThey could not ‘live on the country’, and the diet of acorns, of which\r\nseveral diarists speak, was as repugnant to the pursuers as to the\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the British Army had an unmolested retreat. This did not\r\nprevent many losses of men who dropped to the rear and died of fatigue\r\nand starvation. The carcasses of dead horses all along the road had\r\nbeen hacked up for food. One observer saw thirteen corpses lying round\r\na single fire: another counted so many as fifty men sitting in a clump,\r\nwho declared their absolute incapacity to march a foot farther, and\r\ncould not be induced to move. But the stragglers who did not perish\r\nhobbled on to the camps in the evening for the most part. The cavalry\r\nswept up large numbers of them into safety. That night the column\r\nof Hill reached Tenebron and Moras Verdes: the centre column lodged\r\nabout Santi Espiritus and Alba de Yeltes. The Galicians, forming the\r\nnorthern column, were about Castillo de Yeltes and Fuenteroble. The\r\nmarch of the centre column was accompanied by the curious case of\r\ninsubordination by three divisional generals (those commanding the\r\n1st, 5th, and 7th Divisions[207]) of which Napier makes such scathing\r\nnotice. Their orders gave an itinerary involving a march over fords in\r\nflooded fields; they consulted together, judged the route hopeless, and\r\nturned off towards the bridge of Castillo de Yeltes, which they found\r\nblocked by the Army of Galicia. Wellington, failing to find them on\r\nthe prescribed path, set out to seek them, and came upon them waiting\r\nmiserably in the mud. He is said to have given them no more rebuke\r\nthan a sarcastic ‘You see, gentlemen, I know my own business best’ and\r\nallowed them to cross after the Spaniards, many hours late[208]. The\r\ninsubordination was inexcusable--yet perhaps it would not have been\r\nbeneath Wellington’s dignity to have prefaced his original order with\r\nan explanatory note such as ‘the main road by Castillo bridge being\r\nreserved for the Spanish divisions.’ But this would not have been in\r\nhis normal style. Like Stonewall Jackson fifty years after, he was not\r\nprone to give his reasons to subordinates, even when his orders would\r\nappear to them very inexplicable.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th a march of a few miles brought all the columns within a\r\nshort distance of Ciudad Rodrigo, and the commissariat transport having\r\nreached that place on the preceding day, quite unmolested, arrangements\r\nhad already been made to send out food to meet the approaching columns.\r\n‘About dusk we took up our ground on the face of the hill near\r\nRodrigo--the weather now changing to a severe frost was intensely cold.\r\nWe had not long been halted when the well-known summons of “turn out\r\nfor biscuit” rang in our ears. The strongest went for it, and received\r\ntwo days’ rations for every man. It was customary to make an orderly\r\ndivision, but that night it was dispensed with, each man eagerly seized\r\nwhat he could get, and endeavoured to allay the dreadful gnawing which\r\nhad tormented us during four days of unexampled cold and fatigue. In a\r\nshort time two more rations were delivered, and the inordinate eating\r\nthat ensued threatened to do more mischief than the former want[209].’\r\n\r\nOn the 20th the army was distributed in quarters around and behind\r\nRodrigo--Hill’s column about Martiago, Zamorra, Robledo, Cespedosa, and\r\nother villages on the Upper Agueda; the centre column about Gallegos,\r\nCarpio, Pastores, El Bodon, Campillo, and other cantonments well known\r\nfrom the long tarrying of the army there in 1811. The Galicians were\r\nleft out in the direction of San Felices and the Lower Agueda. Every\r\none was now under cover, and food was abundant--almost too abundant\r\nat first. Rest, warmth, and regular rations were indeed necessary.\r\n‘Scarcely a man had shoes--not that they had not been properly supplied\r\nwith them before the retreat began, but the state of the roads had\r\nbeen such that as soon as a shoe fell off or stuck in the mud, in\r\nplace of picking it up, the man kicked its fellow-companion after it.\r\nYet the infantry was still efficient and fit to do its duty. But the\r\ncavalry and artillery were in a wretched state: the batteries of the\r\n3rd, 6th, and 7th Divisions, the heavy cavalry, with the 11th and 12th\r\nLight Dragoons were nearly a wreck--the artillery of the 3rd Division\r\nlost 70 horses between Salamanca and Rodrigo.... The cavalry was half\r\ndismounted, the artillery without the proper number of horses to draw\r\nthe guns, much less the ammunition cars--many died from cold and famine\r\nunder the harness of the artillery and the saddles of the dragoons....\r\nThe batteries could with difficulty show three horses in place of eight\r\nto a gun[210].’\r\n\r\nStragglers continued to come in for several days. Julian Sanchez was\r\nsent out with his lancers to search the woods for them, and brought in\r\n800 mounted on the horses of his men. But when the divisional returns\r\nwere prepared on November 29th, it was found that besides killed and\r\nwounded in action and sick in hospital, there was a melancholy deficit\r\nof 4921 ‘missing’ since October 23rd. The killed and wounded in action,\r\nas opposed to the missing, were very few considering the dangers which\r\nthe Army had gone through: some 160 at Villadrigo, 440 at Villamuriel\r\nand Palencia, 70 at the Puente Larga, 113 at Alba de Tormes, 187 at\r\nthe combat of the Huebra--smaller fights such as the skirmishes at\r\nTordesillas, Aldea Lengua, and Matilla can hardly account for 200 more\r\nbetween them--the total cannot have exceeded 1,200 casualties in\r\naction. But nearly 5,000 missing was a sad record. How many of them\r\nwere dead, how many had deserted, and how many were prisoners in the\r\nhands of the French, it is hard to determine. The losses in missing\r\nbefore Salamanca had been insignificant--perhaps 500 in each of the\r\ntwo columns of Wellington and Hill--there had been many drunkards and\r\nmalingerers taken both at Torquemada and at Valdemoro. But the main\r\nloss was suffered between the 16th and the 18th of November, in the\r\nwoods and mires between Salamanca and the Yeltes river. Soult, in\r\nhis daily letters to King Joseph, claims to have taken 600 prisoners\r\non the 16th, 1,000 to 1,200 on the 17th, and 100 on the 18th. These\r\nfigures do not appear incredible, and would allow in addition for well\r\nover a thousand men dead, and some hundreds of deserters. The latter\r\nwere certainly numerous in the foreign corps--the Brunswick-Oels and\r\nChasseurs Britanniques show losses in ‘missing’ out of proportion\r\nto all the other regiments[211]. It is noteworthy, when comparing\r\nthe lists of the ‘missing’ in the various divisions, to see that the\r\nPortuguese units suffered far more severely in proportion to their\r\nnumbers than the British. They showed the total of 2,469 as against\r\n2,477, but this was out of 22,000 men only, while the similar British\r\nfigure was out of a total of 32,000 or thereabouts--i. e. their loss\r\nwas about 10·8 per cent. as against about 8 per cent. Several observers\r\nof the retreat note that the cold and perpetual rain told much more\r\nheavily upon the stamina of the Portuguese, whose native climate is far\r\nmore mild than that of the plateaux of Leon. They simply sank by the\r\nwayside, and died, or suffered themselves to be taken prisoners without\r\nattempting to get away. The unit in the whole army which suffered most\r\nheavily in the way of ‘missing’ was Bradford’s Portuguese brigade,\r\nwhich lost 514 men out of 1,645. In the Light and 3rd Divisions the\r\nPortuguese battalions were little more than a third of the British in\r\nnumbers, but had more missing than their comrades in the proportion\r\nof 163 to 92 in one case and 230 to 184 in the other. The worst\r\ndivisional records were those of the 5th and 7th Divisions, which\r\nlost 800 and 600 men respectively: the best those of the 1st, 6th,\r\nand Light Divisions with only 283, 170, and 255. Individual British\r\nregiments differed much: the most unsatisfactory figures were those of\r\na battalion which had only landed at Lisbon that summer, and had not\r\nbeen present at Salamanca. The 1/82nd distinguished itself by leaving\r\nmore drunken stragglers at Valdemoro than any other corps, and had\r\ndropped a terrible proportion of its men between Salamanca and Rodrigo.\r\nWellington put the colonel under arrest, and proposed to try him before\r\na court martial for ‘gross neglect of duty,’ but in the end did not\r\npress matters to a formal prosecution[212].\r\n\r\nFor the first few days after the arrival of the army at Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nWellington was not quite certain that the enemy, after resting on\r\nthe Tormes for a few days, might not resume his advance[213]. This\r\nwas unlikely, owing to the weather and the obvious difficulty of\r\nfinding food for 90,000 men in a devastated countryside. Still, it was\r\nconceivable, and a further advance on Soult’s part would have been very\r\ntiresome, when the allied troops so much required rest, and when some\r\ndangerous cracks seemed to threaten the stability of parts of the newly\r\nrepaired sections of the walls of Ciudad Rodrigo[214]. For six days the\r\narmy was held together, till on November 26th arrived certain news that\r\nSoult was on his way to the province of Avila, and that the greater\r\npart of the Army of Portugal was leaving Salamanca for the rear, and\r\ndistributing itself in its old cantonments in the direction of Toro and\r\nValladolid[215], while King Joseph with the Army of the Centre was on\r\nhis march for Madrid. Since the French were certainly dispersing, there\r\nwas no longer any necessity for keeping the allied army concentrated.\r\nOn the 27th Wellington ordered a general dislocation of the divisions\r\ninto winter quarters. Only the Light Division and Victor Alten’s\r\ncavalry remained about Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida. Of the rest of the\r\narmy, Hill, with his old corps--the 2nd Division, Hamilton’s Portuguese\r\nand Erskine’s cavalry--marched for Coria and Zarza, being directed\r\nto canton themselves in the valley of the Alagon with an advanced\r\npost at Bejar. Campbell’s Portuguese cavalry went to their old haunts\r\nabout Elvas in the Alemtejo, and Penne Villemur and Morillo, with the\r\nEstremaduran Divisions, returned to their native regions. Castaños and\r\nthe Galician army retired also to their own province, marching through\r\nthe Tras-os-Montes by way of Braganza. D’Urban’s Portuguese horse were\r\ncantoned for the winter north of the Douro, but the rest of the allied\r\ncavalry (Bock, Ponsonby, and Anson) were sent far to the rear, to look\r\nfor comfortable quarters in the Mondego valley and the villages south\r\nof Oporto. The remaining British infantry divisions (the 1st, 3rd,\r\n4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) were distributed about the province of Beira,\r\nin various quarters from Lamego to Guarda, at distances of thirty or\r\nfifty miles from the frontier[216]. The general disposition of the\r\ncantonments of the army was not much different from what it had been in\r\nthe first days of 1812, before the long eleven months’ campaign began.\r\nOnly Hill was no longer on the Guadiana, but north of the Tagus, since\r\nthere was no enemy left in Andalusia to require his attention.\r\n\r\nWhile the dispersion was in progress Wellington issued (November 28)\r\nthe _Memorandum to Officers commanding Divisions and Brigades_ which\r\ncaused so many heart-burnings among his subordinates. It was intended\r\nto go no further than those officers; but some of them dispatched\r\ncopies to the colonels of the regiments under their charge, and so it\r\nbecame public property. Written in a moment of intense irritation,\r\nit contained much rebuke that was merited, but was unjust from the\r\nsweeping and general character of the blame that it distributed to\r\nthe whole army, and most certainly failed to take account of the\r\nexceptional conditions of the 15th to the 19th of November. Wellington\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n‘I am concerned to have to observe that the army under my command\r\nhas fallen off in the respect of discipline in the late campaign, to\r\na greater degree than any army with which I have ever served, or of\r\nwhich I have ever read. Yet this army has met with no disaster: it has\r\nsuffered no privations which but trifling attention on the part of\r\nthe officers could not have prevented, and for which there existed no\r\nreason in the nature of the service. Nor has it suffered any hardships,\r\nexcepting those resulting from the necessity of being exposed to the\r\ninclemencies of the weather at a time when they were most severe.\r\nIt must be obvious to every officer that from the moment the troops\r\ncommenced their retreat from the neighbourhood of Burgos on the one\r\nhand, and of Madrid on the other, the officers lost all control over\r\ntheir men. Irregularities and outrages were committed with impunity.\r\nYet the necessity for retreat existing, none was ever made on which\r\nthe troops had such short marches; none on which they made such long\r\nand repeated halts; and none on which the retreating army was so\r\nlittle pressed on their rear by the enemy.... I have no hesitation in\r\nattributing these evils to the habitual inattention of the officers of\r\nthe regiments to their duty, as prescribed by the standing regulations\r\nof the service, and the orders of this army.... The commanding officers\r\nof regiments must enforce the order of the army regarding the constant\r\ninspection and superintendence of the officers over the conduct\r\nof the men in their companies, and they must endeavour to inspire\r\nthe non-commissioned officers with a sense of their situation and\r\nauthority. By these means the frequent and discreditable resort to the\r\nauthority of the Provost, and to punishments by courts martial, will be\r\nprevented, and the soldiers will not dare to commit the offences and\r\noutrages of which there are so many complaints, when they well know\r\nthat their officers and non-commissioned officers have their eyes on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n‘In regard to the food of the soldier, I have frequently observed and\r\nlamented in the late campaign the facility and celerity with which\r\nthe French cooked in comparison with our army. The cause of this\r\ndisadvantage is the same with that of every other--want of attention of\r\nthe officers to the orders of the army and the conduct of their men....\r\nGenerals and field officers must get the captains and subalterns of\r\ntheir regiments to understand and perform the duties required of them,\r\nas the only mode by which the discipline and efficiency of the army can\r\nbe restored and maintained during the next campaign.’\r\n\r\nThere was undoubtedly much to justify the strong language which\r\nWellington used as to the grievous relaxation of discipline in\r\nsome of the regiments. Unfortunately he made no exceptions to his\r\ngeneral statement, and wrote as if the whole army had been guilty\r\nof straggling, drunkenness, and marauding in the same degree. There\r\nwas not the slightest hint that there were many corps which had\r\ngone through the retreat with small loss of men and none of credit.\r\nBut Wellington had seen with his own eyes the disgraceful scenes at\r\nTorquemada, had been roused from his uneasy slumbers by the sound of\r\nthe pig-shooting on the night of November 17, and he had witnessed\r\nthe devastation of San Muñoz and other villages by men who were\r\ntearing whole houses to pieces to get firewood. He had ordered the\r\nProvost-Marshal to hang on the spot two soldiers caught red-handed in\r\nplunder, and sent three officers whose men had pulled down cottages,\r\nwhen collecting fuel, to be court-martialled[217]. The figures of the\r\n‘missing’ in some regiments had rightly provoked his indignation.\r\nBut he might at the same time have noticed that there were not only\r\nbattalions but whole brigades where their number was insignificant.\r\nIn one division of 5,000 men there were but 170--in the five British\r\nbattalions of the Light Division no more than 96. In both these cases\r\nthe deficiency represented only weakly men who had fallen by the way\r\nfrom fatigue and disease, and cannot afford any margin for stragglers\r\nand marauders.\r\n\r\nThe general feeling in the army was that nearly all the loss and\r\nmischief had happened in the inclement days of November 15-18, previous\r\ndisorders having been comparatively insignificant; and as regards\r\nthose days they questioned the justice of Wellington’s indictment of\r\nthe troops. To say that ‘the army had suffered no privations which\r\nbut trifling attention on the part of the officers could not have\r\nprevented’ was simply not true. What ‘trifling attention’ on the part\r\nof the regimental officers could have made up for the fact that some\r\ndivisions had received absolutely no distribution of food of any sort\r\nfor four continuous days, and others in the same four days nothing\r\nbut two rations of beef, and no biscuit or other food at all?[218]\r\nIt was useless to tell them that they had suffered no privations, or\r\nthat they could by care have avoided them. As an intelligent general\r\nofficer wrote on November 20: ‘During the whole of this retreat from\r\nthe 15th inclusive, not only has the weather been dreadfully severe,\r\nbut the commissariat arrangements having failed, the troops have been\r\nmostly without any issue of rations, and have suffered the extremity\r\nof privation, having lived upon acorns and hogs killed occasionally\r\nin the woods. The natural result of this has been great disorder and\r\nconfusion, and the roads in the rear of the columns of march are\r\ncovered with exhausted stragglers left to the enemy. In fact, by some\r\ninconceivable blunder, which the Quartermaster-General’s department\r\nattribute to that of the Commissary-General, and which the latter throw\r\nback on the former, the supplies of the army, which were adequate for\r\nmuch larger numbers, on the morning that we broke up from the Arapiles\r\nwere sent down the Tormes, by Ledesma toward Almeida, while the army\r\nmarched on Ciudad Rodrigo--_hinc illae lachrymae_[219].’\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that sheer lack of food during inclement weather,\r\nand in a desolate and thinly peopled forest-country did most of the\r\nmischief. As an indignant subaltern writes: ‘The officers asked each\r\nother, and asked themselves, how or in what manner they were to blame\r\nfor the privations of the retreat. The answer uniformly was--in no way\r\nwhatever. Their business was to keep the men together, and if possible\r\nto keep up with their men themselves--and this was the most difficult\r\nduty--many of these officers were young lads badly clothed, with\r\nscarcely a shoe or a boot left--some attacked with dysentery, others\r\nwith ague, more with a burning fever raging through their system; they\r\nhad scarce strength to hobble along in company with their more hardy\r\ncomrades, the rank and file[220].’\r\n\r\nWellington’s memorandum stated that the marches were short in miles,\r\nand this was generally true, though on October 23 the infantry had to\r\ndo 29 miles. But mileage is not the only thing to be considered in\r\ncalculating the day’s work--the time spent on the miry roads, where\r\nevery step was ankle deep in slime that tore the shoes from the feet,\r\nwas inordinate: several of the marches were from 4 o’clock, before\r\ndawn, to the same hour in the afternoon. This on an empty stomach and\r\nwith the regulation 60 lb. of weight on the soldier’s back was no\r\nmean task. And sometimes the journey ended, as for the Light and 7th\r\nDivisions on November 17th, in the troops being deployed in battle\r\norder in the drifting rain, and kept for some hours more under arms, to\r\nresist a possible advance of the French. The strain was too much for\r\nmany willing men whose constitution was not over robust. It was not\r\nonly shirkers who fell out and collapsed.\r\n\r\nAs to the matter of the cooking, one capable subaltern remarked in his\r\ndiary, ‘if _we_ were allowed to tear down doors, &c., in every village,\r\nas the enemy do, without having to go miles for wood, we could cook\r\nin as short a time as they[221].’ And another remarks with justice\r\nthat when the companies had to prepare their food in the vast Flanders\r\ncauldrons, carried on mules which dragged at the tail of the regimental\r\nbaggage train, they could never be sure of getting them up to their\r\nbivouacs in good time. There was an immense improvement in 1813, when\r\nlight tin camp-kettles carried alternately by the men of each squad,\r\nwere introduced. These were always at hand, and could be got to boil\r\n‘without needing a whole tree or half a church door to warm them.’\r\nWellington might have spared this criticism on his soldiers’ cooking\r\nwhen he had already, as his dispatches show, asked for the small\r\nkettles to be made, precisely because the cauldrons were too heavy,\r\nand seldom got up in good time[222]. He did well to lament the slow\r\ncooking, but knowing its cause, and having been in command of the army\r\nsince April 1809, might he not have indented for portable kettles\r\nbefore May 1812?\r\n\r\nThe real truth with regard to much of the objurgatory language of\r\nthe ‘Memorandum’ is that, loth though one may be to confess it, the\r\nstaff officer--commander-in-chief or whatever his rank--who has slept\r\nunder cover and had adequate food during such awful days as those of\r\nNovember 15 to November 19, 1812, may easily underrate the privations\r\nof the man in the ranks, who has faced the weather unsheltered and\r\nwith no rations at all. This observation does not in the least affect\r\nthe points on which Wellington did well to be angry--the disgraceful\r\nscenes of drunkenness at Torquemada and Valdemoro, the plundering of\r\nvillages at more points than one, and the excessive straggling from\r\nsome ill-commanded battalions. And, as we have had occasion to point\r\nout before, there was a residuum of bad soldiers in well-nigh every\r\nregiment--Colborne estimates it at 50 or 100 men on the average--and\r\nexceptional circumstances like the storm of Badajoz or the hardships of\r\nthe Salamanca retreat brought this ruffianly element to the surface,\r\nand led to deplorable incidents. Presumably many corps got rid of the\r\nmajority of their _mauvais sujets_ by straggling and desertion on those\r\nwretched November days upon the Valmusa, the Huebra, and the Yeltes.\r\n\r\nHere we may leave the main armies at the end of the campaign. It\r\nremains only to speak of Suchet and his opponents on the coast of\r\nthe Mediterranean. After the departure of Soult and King Joseph from\r\nValencia in the middle of October, it might have been supposed that\r\nthe Duke of Albufera, now left to his own resources, would have been\r\nin some danger. For not only had he in front of him the Anglo-Sicilian\r\ntroops who had landed under Maitland at Alicante, and his old\r\nadversaries of Joseph O’Donnell’s Army, but--since there were now\r\nno French left in Andalusia--all the Spanish detachments which had\r\nformerly watched the eastern flank of that kingdom were available\r\nagainst him. After Soult had occupied Madrid, Elio, Freire, and\r\nBassecourt all came down to Albacete and Chinchilla, to link themselves\r\nwith the Alicante troops. Leaving out the Empecinado and Duran, who did\r\nnot move southward from their mountains on the borders of Aragon and\r\nCastile, there were still 25,000 Spanish troops of the ‘second’ and\r\n‘third’ armies--the old Valencian and Murcian corps, disposable for\r\nuse against Suchet in November[223]. And what was still more ominous\r\nfor the French on the East Coast, a second reinforcement was getting\r\ntogether at Palermo to strengthen the Anglo-Sicilian corps at Alicante.\r\nGeneral Campbell with about 4,000 men sailed on November 14th; this\r\nforce consisted of two British battalions[224], a foreign battalion of\r\nlight companies, 1,500 Italians, and some miscellaneous details. Though\r\nthe Italians (as their conduct proved next spring[225]) were eminently\r\nuntrustworthy material, the rest were an appreciable addition to the\r\nstrength of the expeditionary force, which was now swelled to an army\r\ncorps rather than a large division. They only came to hand on December\r\n2, however, and the best opportunity for attacking Suchet had passed\r\nbefore their landing, since obviously he was most vulnerable when\r\nall the rest of the French armies had passed on to Salamanca, after\r\nNovember 6th, and before King Joseph had come back to Madrid and Soult\r\nto Toledo in the early days of December. The four weeks between those\r\ndates, however, were wasted by the British and Spanish generals on the\r\nEast Coast.\r\n\r\nSuchet had recognized his danger, and had taken up a defensive position\r\nin front of the Xucar, with Harispe’s division at Almanza, Fuente la\r\nHiguera, and Moxente, Habert’s at Albayda across the high-road from\r\nValencia to Alicante, and Musnier’s in reserve, at Alcira and Xativa.\r\nHere he waited on events, having lost touch completely with Soult and\r\nthe King, from whom he received no dispatch for eighty days after their\r\ndeparture from Albacete and Cuenca in October. It was only by way of\r\nSaragossa that he learnt, some weeks later, that they had recaptured\r\nMadrid and then marched for the Tormes[226]. He had only 15,000 men in\r\nline beyond the Xucar, and knew that in front of him there were 7,000\r\nAnglo-Sicilians, 8,000 of Roche and Whittingham’s men, and more than\r\nthat number of the Murcians, all grouped round Alicante, while Elio,\r\nFreire, and Bassecourt, with 8,000 or 9,000 men, were coming in from\r\nthe direction of Madrid, and Villacampa with 3,000 more might appear\r\nfrom Southern Aragon. This was a formidable combination, though the\r\nSpanish troops were badly organized, and had a long record of defeat\r\nbehind them. The disaster of Castalla had shown a few months before\r\nthe incapacity of the leaders and the unsteadiness of the men of the\r\nMurcian army. Yet the number of troops available was large, and the\r\n5,000 English and German Legionary infantry of the Alicante Army\r\nprovided a nucleus of trustworthy material, such as in firm hands might\r\nhave accomplished much.\r\n\r\nUnity and continuity of command, however, was completely wanting. On\r\nSeptember 25th Maitland had fallen sick, and the charge of the troops\r\nat Alicante passed to his second-in-command, General Mackenzie. This\r\nofficer showed signs of wishing to adopt a timid offensive attitude\r\nagainst Suchet. He pushed his own and Whittingham’s divisions out as\r\nfar as Alcoy, opposite Habert’s position at Albayda, and contrived\r\nsome petty naval demonstration against the Valencian coast. Of these\r\nthe most important was an expedition which tried on October 5th to\r\ncapture the town of Denia, the southernmost place in the possession\r\nof the French. It was composed of a wing of the 1/81st, and a company\r\neach of De Roll’s regiment and of marines--about 600 men--under General\r\nDonkin. These troops, carried on the _Fame_ and _Cephalus_, landed\r\nnear Denia, and drove the small French garrison into the castle. This\r\nwas found to be a more formidable work than had been expected, and to\r\nrequire battering by heavy guns. Some cannons were, with difficulty,\r\nlanded from the ships, and a siege would have been commenced but for\r\nthe news that Habert was sending up a relieving force. Whereupon the\r\nlittle expedition re-embarked, men and guns being reshipped with much\r\ndifficulty under the fire of the French on a rocky beach[227]. The loss\r\nwas trifling, but the whole plan was obviously feeble and useless. To\r\nhave turned Suchet’s sea-ward flank with 5,000 men, while threatening\r\nhis front with the rest of the British and Spanish troops available\r\nmight have been a conceivable operation. But what could 600 men,\r\nentirely isolated, hope to accomplish?\r\n\r\nIt must have been long after this fruitless demonstration that\r\nMackenzie received a formal order from Wellington dated from before\r\nBurgos on October 13th[228], bidding him attack Valencia, either by\r\nland or by sea, if Soult and King Joseph should have marched their\r\narmies against Madrid. He was instructed not to accept a general action\r\nwith Suchet, unless he was very superior in numbers, and to beware\r\nof fighting in ground favourable to cavalry. His own mounted force\r\nconsisted only of 230 sabres[229], and 500 belonging to Whittingham and\r\nto the Murcian army were of doubtful efficiency. But it was thought\r\nthat Suchet was very weak, and a little while later Wellington received\r\nfalse information that the Marshal had lent a considerable part of his\r\narmy to King Joseph for the march on Madrid[230]. He therefore hoped\r\nthat a bold advance against Valencia might shake the hold of the French\r\non the Mediterranean coast.\r\n\r\nThe letter directed to Mackenzie was received not by him but by General\r\nWilliam Clinton (the brother of H. Clinton of the 6th Division), who\r\nhad arrived at Alicante and taken command--superseding Mackenzie--on\r\nOctober 25th. Lord William Bentinck had sent him out from Palermo on\r\nhearing of Maitland’s illness. The change of generals had no good\r\nresults--Clinton fell at once into a fierce quarrel with Cruz the\r\nSpanish governor of Alicante. He opined that he ought not to start to\r\nattack Suchet without receiving over control of the Alicante forts,\r\nand placing them in the charge of a British garrison. The Governor\r\nrefused to give up the keys, and much friction ensued, causing an\r\nangry interchange of letters which wasted many days. Wellington, when\r\nhe heard of it, declared that Clinton seemed to have been wholly\r\nunreasonable in his demand[231]. Meanwhile Clinton drew in Mackenzie’s\r\ntroops from the front, instead of making an advance toward Valencia.\r\nSuchet, hearing that there were no red-coated battalions left opposite\r\nHabert, resolved to try the effect of a reconnaissance in force, and\r\nmoved forward against Roche and Whittingham, who still lay at Alcoy.\r\nThe English and Spanish divisions at once drew back to Xixona, twenty\r\nmiles nearer to Alicante. Impressed by this activity on the part of\r\nthe enemy, Clinton wrote to Wellington that Suchet was too strong to\r\nbe meddled with, and that he dared attempt no offensive move toward\r\nValencia[232]. Yet counting Roche, Whittingham, and the Murcian troops\r\nat Alicante, he must have outnumbered the French by nearly two to one.\r\nAnd on November 22 the Governor of Alicante actually surrendered the\r\nkeys of the citadel--the point on which Clinton had insisted as the\r\nnecessary preliminary for active operations.\r\n\r\nNothing had yet been done on the East Coast when on December 2 General\r\nCampbell landed at Alicante with the 4,000 Sicilian troops already\r\nmentioned a few pages back. He was senior to Clinton, and relieved him\r\nof the command. Thus in the 70 days since September 23rd there had\r\nbeen four general officers in successive charge of the force which\r\nwas intended to keep Suchet in check. It would have been difficult to\r\ncontrive a more inconvenient arrangement--both Clinton and Campbell\r\nwere new to the army and the district, and each took many days to make\r\nout his situation, and arrive at a conclusion as to what could and what\r\ncould not be done. Campbell, immediately on his arrival, was solicited\r\nby Elio to attack Suchet, in combination with his own army, which\r\nshould strike in from Albacete on the Marshal’s flank. He offered to\r\nbring up 10,000 men of his own (Freire, Bassecourt, and Villacampa)\r\nand said--apparently without authorization--that Del Parque would\r\nassist, at the head of the Army of Andalusia. But Campbell refused to\r\nstir, and possibly was right, when such cases as Barrosa and Talavera\r\nare taken into consideration. Yet Wellington, his commander-in-chief,\r\nhad ordered the offensive to be taken in no hesitating terms, and the\r\nforce available was undoubtedly too large to be wasted. As Wellington\r\nhimself remarked, most British generals of that day, though bold\r\nenough in action, and capable of acting as efficient lieutenants,\r\nseemed stricken with a mental paralysis when placed in an independent\r\nposition, where the responsibility of taking the initiative was thrown\r\nupon them. It was only exceptional men like Craufurd and Graham who\r\nwelcomed it. The general effect of the Anglo-Sicilian expedition was\r\ndisappointing in the extreme. Suchet had thought, and with reason, that\r\nit would be ruinous to him, both in July and again in November. It\r\nturned out to be a negligible quantity in the game, except so far as it\r\nprevented the French Army of Valencia from moving any of its 15,000 men\r\nto co-operate with Soult or King Joseph. Wellington had hoped for much\r\ngreater profit from the diversion.\r\n\r\nAfter all, a much larger body of French troops than Suchet’s field\r\nforce in front of Valencia was being at this time kept completely\r\nemployed, by enemies who owned a far less numerous following than\r\nCampbell or Elio. The little Army of Catalonia, not 8,000 strong, was\r\nfinding employment all through the autumn and winter for Decaen’s\r\n20,000 men; and Duran and Villacampa in Aragon--aided occasionally\r\nby Mina from the side of Navarre, and Sarsfield from the side of\r\nCatalonia--were keeping the strong force under Reille, Severoli, and\r\nCaffarelli in constant movement, and occasionally inflicting severe\r\nloss on its flying columns. Their co-operation in the general cause\r\nwas useful and effective--that of the Alicante Army was not. To sum up\r\nall the operations on the eastern side of Spain we may say that there\r\nhad been practically no change in the situation of the adversaries\r\nsince February. The amount of territory occupied by the French was\r\nunchanged--they had made no progress in the pacification of Aragon\r\nor Catalonia; but on the other hand Suchet’s hold on Valencia still\r\nremained entirely unshaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXIV: CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCRITICAL SUMMARY OF THE CAMPAIGNS OF 1812\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Wellington’s divisions took up in December 1812 almost the\r\nsame cantonments that they had occupied in December 1811, ere they\r\nmarched out at midwinter to the leaguer of Ciudad Rodrigo, the aspect\r\nof affairs in the Peninsula had been completely transformed during\r\nthe intervening twelve months. It was not merely that Andalusia,\r\nEstremadura, and Asturias had been freed from the presence of the\r\nFrench armies, who were never to return. Nor was it merely that--to use\r\nWellington’s own words[233]--‘we have sent to England little less than\r\n20,000 prisoners,[234] have taken and destroyed, or have now ourselves\r\nthe use of, the enemy’s arsenals in Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca,\r\nValladolid, Madrid, Astorga, Seville, and the lines before Cadiz, and\r\nupon the whole have taken or destroyed, or now possess, little short of\r\n3,000 pieces of their cannon[235].’ Nor was it the all-important thing\r\nthat the Armies of Portugal, the Centre, and the South, Wellington’s\r\nimmediate enemies, were in November weaker by 30,000 men than they\r\nhad been in March, and this though they had received 10,000 men in\r\ndrafts since the summer ended. The fact that really counted was that\r\nthe whole French system in Spain had been shaken to its foundations.\r\nIt was useless to pretend any longer that King Joseph was a legitimate\r\nsovereign, and the Cadiz government a mere knot of rebels driven\r\ninto their last and remotest place of refuge. The dream of complete\r\nconquest, which had lingered on down to the moment of Suchet’s capture\r\nof Valencia, was gone for ever. The prestige of the French arms was\r\nshattered: the confidence of the officers in the marshals, that of the\r\nmen in their officers, had disappeared. As Foy, the most intelligent\r\nof the French observers, sums up the matter, what hope was there for\r\nthe future when the whole available field force of the French armies\r\nof Spain, superior in number by a third to Wellington’s army, had been\r\ncollected on a single field, and had allowed the enemy to march away\r\npractically unmolested? ‘Wellington goes off unbeaten, with the glory\r\nof his laurels of the Arapiles untarnished, after having restored to\r\nthe Spaniards all the lands south of the Tagus, after having forced us\r\nto destroy our own magazines and fortifications, and deprived us of all\r\nthe resources that resulted from our former conquests and ought to have\r\nsecured their retention[236].’ There was a profound dissatisfaction\r\nthroughout the French Army; and as the winter drew on, and the ill\r\nnews from Russia began slowly to drift in, it became evident that the\r\nold remedy for all ills so often suggested in 1810-11--the personal\r\nappearance of the Emperor in Spain with large reinforcements--was never\r\nlikely to come to pass. Indeed, troops would probably be withdrawn\r\nfrom Spain rather than sent thither, and the extra subsidies in money,\r\nfor which King Joseph was always clamouring, were never likely to be\r\nforthcoming from the Imperial Exchequer.\r\n\r\nAs to the past campaign, belated recriminations continued to fly about:\r\nClarke--the Minister of War at Paris--was the central point round which\r\nthey revolved, since it was through him that the reports went to the\r\nEmperor from Spain, and to him that the rare answers came back from\r\nsome Russian bivouac, when the master had a moment’s leisure from his\r\nown troubles. Generally he wrote in a very discouraging strain: ‘vous\r\nsentez qu’éloigné comme je suis, je ne puis rien faire pour les armées\r\nd’Espagne[237].’ His occasional comments were scathing--Marmont’s\r\nreports were all lies, he was to be interrogated in a formal series of\r\nquestions, as to why he had dared to fight at Salamanca. The quarrels\r\nof Joseph and Soult were unworthy of serious attention: ‘il ne pouvait\r\npas s’occuper de semblables pauvretés dans un moment où il était à la\r\ntête de 500,000 hommes, et faisait des choses immenses.’ Considering\r\nthe way in which Soult had wrecked all the plans of the King and Joseph\r\nin June-July, by deliberate disobedience to a long series of orders\r\nsent by his hierarchic superior, it was poor comfort to Joseph to be\r\ntold that he must continue to put up with him. ‘Le Maréchal Soult\r\nest la seule tête militaire qu’il y eût en Espagne: on ne pouvait\r\nl’en retirer sans compromettre l’armée[238].’ ‘Why had the King ever\r\nreturned to Spain in 1811?’ said the Emperor--though a reference to\r\nthe correspondence between them in that year tends to show that Joseph\r\nhad offered to abdicate, or take any other step prescribed to him,\r\nand that it was his brother who preferred to keep him at Madrid as a\r\nfigure-head. Napoleon, it is clear, was vexed at being worried by the\r\naffairs of the Peninsula at a moment when he required all his time\r\nfor the contemplation of his own problems, and discharged his wrath,\r\ndeserved or undeserved, in all directions. It may be doubted whether he\r\never thought of himself as perhaps the greatest offender of all; but\r\nit was--as we have already shown at great length[239]--precisely his\r\nown elaborate orders which led first to the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo and\r\nthen to that of Badajoz. But for these initial strokes Wellington’s\r\ntask in the later spring would have been far more difficult. And it\r\nis certainly the fact that if Marmont had been allowed to follow his\r\nown inspiration in February and March, Badajoz at least might have\r\nbeen saved. As to what followed in June and July, Soult must take the\r\nmain share of the blame. Wellington’s game would have been far harder\r\nif the Army of the South had obeyed the King’s orders, and come up\r\nto the Tagus in June. Soult would have had to evacuate Andalusia,\r\nit is true; but he none the less had to abandon it in the end, and\r\nit would have made all the difference in the world to the fate of\r\nthe campaign if he had come northward while Marmont’s Army was still\r\nintact, and not after it had received the crushing blow of July 22nd\r\nat Salamanca. No rational student of the events of that summer can fail\r\nto recognize that Jourdan and the King had found the right conclusion,\r\nand issued the right orders, and that Soult’s determination to hang on\r\nto Andalusia till the last moment showed as much mental perversity as\r\nmilitary insubordination. His counter-plan for inducing the King to\r\ncome to Seville, abandoning Madrid before Marmont had even tried the\r\nfortune of battle, was simply the wild project of a viceroy loth to\r\nabandon his realm, and convinced that every one else ought to give way\r\nfor his own personal profit[240]. To surrender Central and Northern\r\nSpain to Wellington, and to allow all communications between Andalusia\r\nand France to be cut would have been insane. The King would only have\r\nbrought 15,000 men with him: Soult could not have added a greater field\r\nforce than 25,000 men more--as was repeatedly shown when he tried to\r\nconcentrate in Estremadura. Their joint 40,000 would have neither been\r\nenough to face Wellington nor to threaten Portugal. Meanwhile Spain\r\nfrom the Ebro to the Sierra Morena would have passed into the hands of\r\nthe Allies. It is unnecessary to dilate further on the topic.\r\n\r\nA more interesting problem, and one into which Napier went at great\r\nlength, is the criticism of the campaigns of 1812 from the other\r\npoint of view, that of Wellington. It is clear that there is nothing\r\nbut praise to be bestowed on the masterly strategical combination\r\nof January and March, which brought about the captures of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo and Badajoz. Each fell before a blow delivered at the precise\r\nmoment when it must be most effective. The position of the enemy had\r\nbeen carefully calculated, and every adverse possibility taken into\r\nconsideration. It is obvious that Rodrigo was doomed without fail\r\nfrom the first, because Wellington had realized and demonstrated to\r\nhimself the inability of the French to hinder his enterprise, after the\r\nImperial orders had sent Montbrun off to the borders of Valencia. And\r\nBadajoz was destined to fall also, unless Marmont should help Soult at\r\nthe earliest possible moment and with the greatest possible force.\r\nThere was in this case an adverse chance, though not a very great one:\r\nthat it never came near to occurring was due to the Emperor’s removal\r\nof Marmont’s southern divisions from the Tagus valley. But even if\r\nthis fortunate intervention of Napoleon had not simplified the task of\r\nthe Allied Army, it was still improbable that Marmont would appear in\r\ntime; and the improbability had been ascertained by careful study of\r\nthe state of the magazines and the distribution of the cantonments of\r\nthe Army of Portugal. Soult without Marmont could accomplish nothing,\r\nand on this fact Wellington based his plan. If the Duke of Dalmatia\r\nhad brought up 10,000 men more than he actually did, his advance would\r\nstill have been insufficient to save Badajoz.\r\n\r\nAs to the details of the siege of that fortress, we have seen that\r\nthings by no means went as Wellington desired. He himself threw the\r\nblame on the want of trained sappers, and the inexpertness of his\r\nengineer officers[241]. The engineers’ reply was that they were\r\ndirected to work ‘against time’, and not given sufficient days or\r\nmeans to carry out their operations according to the regular methods\r\nof their craft. ‘The project of attack adopted would not stand the\r\ntest of criticism as a scientific operation, but possessed merit as a\r\nbold experiment to reduce in an unusually short time a considerable\r\nfortress, well armed and well countermined, by the agency of unskilled\r\nsappers, no miners, and insufficient ordnance[242].’ Probably the\r\nverdict of the historian must be that the time-problem was the\r\ndominating fact, and that had there been no relieving armies in the\r\nfield other methods would have been pursued[243]. It is at least\r\ncertain that the rapidity with which the place was taken disconcerted\r\nSoult[244], and upset all the plans of the French in Spain.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Badajoz Wellington had his choice between the\r\ninvasion of Andalusia and that of the valley of the Douro. It can\r\nhardly be doubted that he was right in choosing the latter, not\r\nonly on the ground which he himself stated, that Marmont’s was the\r\n‘operating army’[245] and the more dangerous of the two, but because\r\n(as Marmont put it) a disaster in the North would compel the French to\r\nevacuate the South, while a disaster in the South would have no such\r\neffect in the North. The victory of Salamanca liberated Andalusia and\r\nMadrid as well as the Douro valley--a similar victory somewhere in\r\nfront of Seville would have cleared Andalusia, no doubt, but would not\r\nhave sufficed to deliver the Castiles and Leon. The Northern operation\r\nwas the most decisive. The well-timed storm of the Almaraz forts\r\nsecured for that operation a reasonable amount of time, during which it\r\ncould not be disturbed by the appearance of reinforcements for the Army\r\nof Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe irruption into Leon in June, for which such careful subsidiary\r\noperations had been made on all sides--in Andalusia and Catalonia, on\r\nthe Bay of Biscay and in Navarre--had at first all the results that\r\ncould have been expected. But it can hardly be denied that a grave\r\nmistake was made when no adequate preparations were made for the siege\r\nof the Salamanca forts--and this was a mistake that was to be repeated\r\nunder very similar circumstances before Burgos in September. There was\r\nnothing to prevent a proper battering-train from being brought out from\r\nRodrigo or Almeida. Yet a worse slip, most certainly, was made when\r\non June 21st Wellington refused the battle that Marmont most rashly\r\noffered. He could have fought with the advantage of numbers, position,\r\nand superiority in cavalry, in a measure that he was not to enjoy\r\nagain during the Salamanca campaign. Why he held back we now know--he\r\nthought (and not without good reason) that if he did not attack\r\nMarmont, the presumptuous Marshal would attack him. Such a project\r\nindeed was in his adversary’s mind, and if it had been carried out\r\nthe result would undoubtedly have been a second Bussaco. But Marmont\r\nhesitated--and was saved for the moment. That he was able to retire\r\nwith an intact army behind the Douro was a terrible disappointment\r\nto Wellington; for, during the deadlock that ensued for nearly three\r\nweeks, the French Armies of the North, South, and Centre might have\r\nspared reinforcements for the Army of Portugal. Soult’s perversity,\r\nCaffarelli’s want of perception of the relative importance of things,\r\nand King Joseph’s tardiness prevented these possible reinforcements\r\nfrom getting up in time. But this Wellington could not foresee, and\r\nhe was under the impression that nothing was more possible than the\r\narrival of Marmont’s expected succours. If the French should play the\r\nright game, Wellington thought it probable that he might have had to\r\nevacuate Salamanca and his other recent conquests, and to retire to the\r\nAgueda and the protection of Ciudad Rodrigo. Fortunately there turned\r\nout to be no necessity for this heart-breaking move. Marmont came\r\nforward on July 15th, without having received any of the assistance\r\nthat he had expected from the other armies, and involved himself in the\r\nmanœuvres that were to end in complete disaster. By his first movement,\r\nthe ingenious demonstration on the side of Toro, ending by the passage\r\nof the whole French army over the Douro at the distant Tordesillas,\r\nhe distinctly scored a point over his adversary. Wellington was only\r\nprepared to fight a defensive battle at this moment; and when the Duke\r\nof Ragusa refused, on the Guarena (July 18), to indulge him in such a\r\nfashion, and continued to turn his right flank on several successive\r\ndays, he always gave back, awaiting an opportunity that seemed never\r\nabout to arrive. The head-quarters staff of the allied army marvelled\r\nat their leader’s caution, on the days (July 19-20) when the two armies\r\nwere executing their parallel marches about Vallesa and Cantalapiedra.\r\nAt any moment a battle on equal terms could have been brought about,\r\nbut it was refused. Yet Wellington had recently acquired the knowledge\r\nthat King Joseph was just starting from Madrid to join Marmont with\r\n15,000 men; and a victory over the Army of Portugal before it should be\r\nreinforced was the only way out of the dangerous situation. He would\r\nnot commit himself to the chance of an offensive battle, and--as his\r\ndispatches show--made up his mind to abandon Salamanca and fall back\r\nupon the Agueda, unless his adversary should oblige him by making some\r\nobvious blunder.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of the moment--as has been shown above--was that he\r\nconsidered that an indecisive victory, entailing heavy loss in his\r\nown ranks, would have availed him little. Unless he could put Marmont\r\ncompletely out of action by a very crushing blow, the Marshal would be\r\njoined by the Army of the Centre and other reinforcements, and would\r\nstill be able to make head against him. At the bottom of his mind,\r\nit is clear, lay the consideration that he had in his hands the only\r\nfield-army that Great Britain possessed, that in risking it he would\r\nrisk everything--even the loss of Portugal,--and that the total force\r\nof the French in the Peninsula was so great that he must not fight\r\nsave at a marked advantage. His own 50,000 men were the sole hope of\r\nthe allied cause--Marmont’s Army was but one of several bodies whose\r\nexistence he had to bear in mind. As long as he kept his army intact,\r\nthe enemy could do no more than push him back to the Agueda: when they\r\nhad got him thus far, they would have to disperse again, for they could\r\nnot feed on the countryside, nor invade Portugal with less than 100,000\r\nmen. But if he were to wreck his army by suffering a check, or even by\r\nwinning a bloody and indecisive success, he could not calculate where\r\nhis retreat might end, or how great the disaster might be.\r\n\r\nWellington’s caution was rewarded on the 22nd July, when his adversary\r\nat last fell into reckless over-confidence, and invited defeat, by\r\nstringing out his army along an arc of six miles opposite the strong\r\nand concentrated line of the Allies. The punishment was prompt and\r\ncrushing--the sudden advance of Wellington was a beautiful piece of\r\ntactics, ‘a battle in the style of Frederic the Great’ as the sagacious\r\nFoy observed, in a fit of enthusiasm wherein the admiration of the\r\nskilled soldier prevailed over the national pride of the Frenchman.\r\nMarmont’s host was not merely beaten, but scattered and demoralized: it\r\nwas put out of action for some time, and if Carlos de España had only\r\nmaintained the castle of Alba de Tormes there would have been nothing\r\nleft worth mentioning of the Army of Portugal. Even as things actually\r\nfell out, the victory was absolutely complete, and placed all the\r\nvalley of the Douro and Central Spain in Wellington’s hands.\r\n\r\nAfter Salamanca he had it in his power to choose between thrusting\r\nClausel and the battered Army of Portugal behind the Ebro, and marching\r\non Madrid to deal with King Joseph and Soult. His choice of the second\r\nalternative has often been criticized, and ascribed to motives which\r\nwere far from his mind. The real cause of his turn to the South was\r\nhis belief that Soult must now evacuate Andalusia, and that he would\r\ntherefore have all his army concentrated, and no longer frittered away\r\nin garrisons, as it had been for the last two years. Instead of being\r\nable to collect 25,000 men only for the field, the Duke of Dalmatia\r\nwould have 50,000 available, and when joined by the King and perhaps by\r\nSuchet, he would need to be faced by the whole allied army. Wellington\r\ntherefore intended that Hill should join him; together they could deal\r\nwith the largest block of French troops still left in the Peninsula.\r\nHis intention was to force matters to a decision in the South, and he\r\nthought it likely that he might find Soult already marching upon Toledo\r\nwith his whole army. In this expectation he was entirely disappointed;\r\nthe Marshal--as we have seen--refused for a month to evacuate his\r\nviceroyalty, and stayed there so long that Wellington began to think\r\nthat he would have to go down to Andalusia to evict him. ‘I suspect,’\r\nhe wrote at last on August 18, ‘that he will not stir, till I force him\r\nout, by a direct movement upon him, and I think of making that movement\r\nas soon as I can take the troops to the South without injuring their\r\nhealth.’\r\n\r\nThis was an unexpected development: ‘any other but a modern French Army\r\nwould now leave the province (Andalusia), as they have absolutely no\r\ncommunication of any kind with France, or with any other French army,\r\nand are pressed on all sides,’ wrote Wellington. Yet Soult lingered,\r\nand meanwhile the Army of Portugal, rallied in a shorter time than\r\ncould have been expected, returned to Valladolid, and assumed the\r\noffensive in the valley of the Douro. The trouble in that direction\r\nbecame so acute that Wellington resolved to march against Clausel, with\r\na force sufficient to drive him back to the Ebro, intending afterwards\r\nto return to Madrid to pick up the other half of his own army, to join\r\nwith Hill, and then to deal with Soult, whose tardy resolve to evacuate\r\nAndalusia was only just becoming evident.\r\n\r\nThe march against Clausel was necessary; and it seems a misfortune\r\nthat Wellington left three of his best divisions at Madrid--which was\r\nobviously in no danger for the present, and where Hill was expected to\r\narrive ere long. It turned out that the force put in motion against\r\nValladolid and Burgos was too small--even after it had been joined by\r\nClinton and the Galicians--to secure the complete predominance in the\r\nNorth which was necessary. Clausel retreated, but was pursued in a\r\nsomewhat cautious fashion, and only as far as Burgos. It would appear\r\nthat if Wellington had brought 10,000 men more with him from Madrid,\r\nand if he had invested Burgos with the Galician Army, and followed hard\r\nupon Clausel with all his Anglo-Portuguese, he might have driven the\r\nFrench not only beyond the Ebro, but as much farther as he pleased.\r\nFor Clausel could not have stood for a moment if Wellington’s power\r\nhad been a little greater, and Caffarelli was in September so entirely\r\ntaken up with the operations of Home Popham, Mina, and Mendizabal that\r\nhe had not a man to spare.\r\n\r\nBut Wellington advanced no farther than Burgos, and allowed Clausel\r\nto lie opposite him at Briviesca unmolested, till he had drawn great\r\nreinforcements from France, and had at last induced Caffarelli to\r\ncome to his aid with 10,000 men. Meanwhile, he was devoting himself\r\nto the siege of Burgos, where, by his own fault, he had no sufficient\r\nartillery resources to subdue an improvised fortress of the third\r\nclass. The fault was exactly the same as that which had been committed\r\nbefore the Salamanca Forts in June. And--as has been demonstrated\r\nabove--Wellington had been pressed to take more heavy guns with him,\r\nboth by Sir Home Popham and by officers at Madrid. And if he had called\r\nfor them, even after the siege began, they could have reached him in\r\ntime. His own curious comments on the facts are not convincing:\r\n\r\n‘I see that a disposition exists to blame the Government for the\r\nfailure of the siege of Burgos. The Government had nothing to say\r\nto the siege: it was entirely my own act. In regard to means, there\r\nwere ample means, both at Madrid and at Santander, for the siege of\r\nthe strongest fortress. That which was wanting at both places was the\r\nmeans of transporting ordnance and military stores.... I could not find\r\nmeans for moving even one gun from Madrid. Popham is a gentleman who\r\npicques himself on overcoming all difficulties. He knows the time it\r\ntook to find transport even for about 100 barrels of powder and a few\r\nhundred thousand rounds of musket ammunition that he sent me. As for\r\nthe two guns that he endeavoured to send me, I was obliged to send my\r\nown cattle to draw them, and felt great inconvenience from the want of\r\nthose cattle in subsequent movements of the Army[246].’\r\n\r\nThe answer that must be made to these allegations is that when matters\r\ncame to a crisis at Madrid, on Soult’s approach, enough transport was\r\nfound there to send off to Ciudad Rodrigo great part of the Retiro\r\nstores--though much of the material there had to be blown up. If\r\nthere were not draught animals for even half a dozen guns to be got\r\nat Madrid, why did Wellington write on August 31st that ‘if the enemy\r\nshall advance, all arrangements must be made for the evacuation of\r\nMadrid, such as sending away sick, _stores_, &c., and eventually for\r\nthe destruction of what cannot be carried off[247].’ Considerable\r\nconvoys marched with Hill when the Spanish capital was evacuated,\r\nand it is impossible to believe that the 322 draught mules which, by\r\nDickson’s estimate, were the proper allowance for a 24-pound battery\r\nof six guns with 180 rounds per gun, could not have been procured at\r\nMadrid in September. A requisition on the batteries and transport\r\ntrain of the four divisions left round Madrid could have been made to\r\nsupplement local resources. But Wellington had made up his mind to risk\r\nthe Burgos campaign with no more than Dickson’s trifling ‘artillery\r\nreserve’--of which the only efficient part was precisely three iron\r\n18-pounders. As to the allusions to Home Popham, they must--with all\r\nregret--be described as ungrateful. And they conceal the fact that the\r\ntwo heavy ship-guns which Popham had sent forward were only brought\r\n_from Reynosa_ by Wellington’s own draught beasts. Popham got them\r\nacross the mountains from Santander by his own exertions, and would\r\nhave sent them some weeks earlier but for Wellington’s refusal to ask\r\nfor them. And it was the ammunition sent by Popham which alone enabled\r\nthe siege to go on for as long as it did.\r\n\r\nThe calculations--miscalculations rather--which kept the main Army\r\nin front of Burgos to such a late day in the season as October 20th,\r\nhave been dealt with in a previous chapter. The united force of Souham\r\nand Caffarelli was undervalued; it was not till Wellington saw their\r\ntwo armies deployed that he recognized that they had 20,000 men more\r\nin hand than he had supposed. And on the other front he relied too\r\nmuch on the strength of the line of the Tagus for defence. We must\r\nconcede that if the weather had been the same in New Castile as it\r\nwas in Wellington’s own region, if the Tagus had been in flood like\r\nthe Arlanzon and the Pisuerga, and the desperate rains that prevailed\r\nat Burgos had prevailed also at Toledo and Aranjuez, his plan would\r\nprobably have been successful. But who dares make the weather a fixed\r\npoint in military calculations? The season disappointed him, and\r\nSoult was lucky enough to find bright days and hard roads and streams\r\nhalf dry as he advanced on Madrid[248], though Wellington was almost\r\nembogged and moved among perpetual fogs in the North.\r\n\r\nStill, the cardinal fact at the bottom of the unfortunate Burgos\r\ncampaign was that the Anglo-Portuguese Army was not strong enough\r\nfor the task in hand, when Soult’s whole force, and great part of\r\nthe Army of the North also, came into the field to aid the armies of\r\nPortugal and the Centre. The permanent evacuation of Andalusia and the\r\ntemporary evacuation of Biscay put into movement 60,000 men who had\r\nhitherto been for the most part locked up in the occupation of those\r\nregions. When they became an ‘operating army’ Wellington was hopelessly\r\noutnumbered. He himself thought that he might yet have pulled through\r\nthe crisis, without being compelled to evacuate Madrid and the two\r\nCastiles, if only Ballasteros had obeyed orders, and distracted Soult\r\nby an irruption into La Mancha against the flank of the advancing\r\nenemy. Undoubtedly that General was most perverse and disloyal; but it\r\nseems quite possible that if he had advanced, as ordered, he would only\r\nhave let himself in for one of those crushing defeats which commanders\r\nof his type so often suffered during the war. The fact was that the\r\nFrench armies, when once concentrated, were too numerous to be held\r\nin check. Wellington’s only real chance of success would have been\r\nto concentrate every man either against Souham and Caffarelli on the\r\none side, or against Soult and the King on the other. This was made\r\ndifficult by the initial division of his army into two nearly equal\r\nhalves--which resulted in his own force being too weak to deal with the\r\nFrench Northern Army, and Hill’s similarly too weak to deal with the\r\nSouthern Army. He had intended, when he left Madrid on August 31st, to\r\nreturn thither with the bulk of his marching force, after disposing\r\nof the northern enemy, and (as we have seen) this idea was still in\r\nhis head even as late as early October. But he failed to carry out his\r\nintention, partly because he had allowed himself to get entangled in\r\nthe siege of Burgos, partly because the French army in front of him\r\nproved much stronger than he had originally calculated.\r\n\r\nThe only occasion on which it was actually in his power for a few\r\ndays to combine Hill’s force and his own for a blow at one of the two\r\nhostile armies, while the other was still far off, was on the 3rd-5th\r\nof November. He saw the chance, but deliberately refused to take it,\r\nfor reasons which we have seen set forth[249], and which were perfectly\r\nconvincing. If he had concentrated against either of the French armies,\r\nit might have refused to fight and drawn back, while the other was in\r\na position to cut off his line of communication with Salamanca and\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nHe resolved, and at this moment the resolve was wise, not to attempt\r\nany such blow, but to fall back on the well-known and formidable\r\npositions round Salamanca. Here he thought that he could defend the\r\nline of the Tormes, even against a combined force that outnumbered\r\nhim by 25,000 men. Probably he would have succeeded if the enemy\r\nhad delivered a frontal attack, as Jourdan and the majority of the\r\nFrench generals desired. But Soult’s safe but indecisive policy of\r\nrefusing to make such an attack, and turning the Allied flank by the\r\nfords of the upper Tormes, was adopted. The only counter to this move\r\nwould have been to assail the French while they were in the midst of\r\ntheir manœuvre, even as Marmont had been assailed at the battle of\r\nthe Arapiles. But the disparity of numbers was on this occasion too\r\ngreat for such a stroke to be prudent, and Wellington was forced, most\r\nunwillingly, to retreat to the frontier of Portugal.\r\n\r\nBut for two mishaps--the coming on of absolutely abominable weather and\r\nthe misdirection of the food-supplies by Colonel Gordon--this retreat\r\nwould have been uneventful, and would have been attended with little\r\nor no loss. For the French pursuit was timid and ineffective, and only\r\ncarried out by a fraction of the enemy’s army--nearly half of it halted\r\nat Salamanca, and the remaining part was not strong enough to attack\r\nWellington. As it chanced, Gordon’s errors and the plague of immoderate\r\nrains not only cost Wellington several thousand men, but produced an\r\nimpression of disaster both on the minds of those who took part in the\r\nmiserable march and on those of the captious critics in London. What\r\nshould have been ‘a good clean retreat’ became a rather disastrous\r\naffair. But this was not due to the enemy, and the French observers\r\ngot small comfort from it--as we have already shown by quoting Foy’s\r\nperspicuous and angry comments on the operations around Salamanca[250].\r\nWellington got off with ‘an army in being,’ and if it was tired out,\r\nso was that of his opponents. A hundred thousand men had been scraped\r\ntogether from every corner of the Peninsula to overwhelm him, but\r\nhad failed to do so. Meanwhile he had cleared all Spain south of the\r\nTagus valley from the enemy, had broken their prestige, and had shaken\r\nto pieces the pretension of King Joseph to be taken seriously as the\r\nmonarch of the greatest vassal-kingdom of his brother’s empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWINTER QUARTERS. DECEMBER 1812-JANUARY 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Anglo-Portuguese Army halted at Ciudad Rodrigo, and came back\r\nonce more to regular rations and marches that were no longer forced,\r\nit was of course in very bad condition. The cold and wet of the last\r\nten days’ retreat from Salamanca had caused many a man to drop dead\r\nby the way, and had sent thousands of sick to the hospitals, riddled\r\nwith dysentery and rheumatism. And the hospitals and dépôts were even\r\nbefore this last influx loaded up with convalescents not fit for\r\nservice, from the casualties of Salamanca and Burgos. The December\r\nmorning states were enough to fill Wellington with dismay; of his\r\n64[251] British battalions there were only 30,397 men present with the\r\ncolours--an average of much less than 500 bayonets to the battalion.\r\nThere were no less than 18,000 men in hospital--more than a third of\r\nthe total strength of the infantry arm. Thirteen regiments had more men\r\n‘sick’ than ‘effective’; twelve were down to under 300 strong[252].\r\nThe cavalry had not lost so many in proportion--they had 5,700 present\r\nunder arms to 1,436 sick, but could not mount more than 5,000, owing to\r\nthe loss of horses during the retreat, and the surviving horses were\r\nfor the most part in bad condition.\r\n\r\nThe first thing necessary was to get the troops under cover and well\r\nfed: a very long rest was obviously necessary to allow the way-worn and\r\nexhausted men time to recover their strength, and the convalescents to\r\nrejoin from the hospitals. With the winter drafts known to be ready and\r\nstarting from England, to the number of some 5,000[253], beside one or\r\ntwo more complete battalions promised for the Peninsula, there might\r\nbe an army in April 1813 no less strong than that which had opened\r\nthe campaign of 1812. But clearly the only movement to be thought of\r\nat present was that of getting the divisions into comfortable winter\r\nquarters. Accordingly the army broke up a few days after reaching\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, and spread itself out in dispositions not unlike those\r\nof the December previous, save that nothing was left so far to the\r\nSouth as had been the custom in other years. For Soult was no longer\r\nin Andalusia, and the right wing of the Allied army had no reason to\r\ndescend as far as the Guadiana.\r\n\r\nBy December the 1st Division had distributed itself on the upper\r\nMondego around Guarda and Vizeu[254]; the 3rd Division was farther\r\nnorth, about Moimento de Beira; the 4th, with head-quarters at S.\r\nJoão de Pesqueira, occupied cantonments along the Douro; the 5th was\r\na little lower down the same river in Lamego and the neighbouring\r\nvillages. The 6th Division lay somewhat farther back on the northern\r\nslope of the Serra de Estrella, along the high road parallel with the\r\nmiddle Mondego, with head-quarters at Cea; the 7th at Moimento da Serra\r\nand Santa Marinha, also under the Estrella. Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese went north of the Douro, to Penafiel and Villa Real\r\nrespectively. Only the much-enduring Light Division was left in rather\r\ncold and bare quarters on the frontier, occupying familiar billets at\r\nFuentes de Oñoro, Alameda, Gallegos, and other villages between the Coa\r\nand the Agueda. The cavalry was all sent back to the rear, even so far\r\nas the coast-plain at the mouths of the Vouga and the Mondego, save\r\nV. Alten’s brigade, which remained on the Agueda in company with the\r\nLight Division, and D’Urban’s Portuguese, who went back to Braganza, in\r\nthe far north-east of the Tras-os-Montes, on the Spanish frontier. Any\r\nobserver noting these dispositions as a whole could not but conclude\r\nthat they were most easily explained by an intention to resume in the\r\nnext spring the old line of the Allied advance of 1812; since all\r\nthe British troops were conveniently placed for a concentration on\r\nthe Agueda, and a march on Salamanca. The fact that the three small\r\nPortuguese units had been sent north of the Douro would attract little\r\nattention. And this no doubt was the impression which Wellington wished\r\nto produce on any secret agents of the French who might report the\r\nlocation of his winter quarters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as in earlier years, Hill took the old Army of Estremadura,\r\nthe British 2nd Division, Hamilton’s Portuguese division, and Erskine’s\r\ntwo cavalry brigades, back to the South, but only as far as the Tagus\r\nand the Alagon, not to the Guadiana. He fixed his head-quarters at\r\nCoria, and distributed the brigades of the 2nd Division in the mountain\r\nvillages above, covering the great passes of the Sierra de Francia and\r\nthe Sierra de Gata, the Puerto de Baños and the Puerto de Perales[255].\r\nHamilton’s division lay inside its own country, at Moraleja, Idanha,\r\nand Penamacor. The cavalry head-quarters were at Brozas in the valley\r\nof the Tagus, near Alcantara and its Roman bridge. Here Erskine,\r\nthe cavalry divisional general, committed suicide by jumping out of\r\na high window in a state of frenzy. Wellington had long wanted to\r\nget rid of him--though not in this sad way--and for good reason, as\r\nis explained by several incidents of 1811 and 1812 which have been\r\nnoticed in previous volumes. Yet he had never been able to obtain his\r\ndeparture--political influences at home stood in the way. Erskine being\r\nthus removed, the Commander-in-Chief at once dissolved the 2nd Cavalry\r\nDivision, and its two British brigades (Long’s and Fane’s) ceased to\r\nhave any other connexion with each other, beyond that of being both\r\nattached to Hill’s Corps.\r\n\r\nThe disposition for Hill’s winter quarters was obviously intended not\r\nmerely to cover the great passes between the valleys of the Douro and\r\nthe Tagus, but also to give the enemy cause to think that Wellington\r\nmight some day attack on the southern front, either by a sudden advance\r\nup the Tagus on Talavera and Madrid, or by a blow at Avila across the\r\nPuente de Congosto defile. Either operation would be equally possible\r\nto a force based on Coria. And repeatedly during the spring rumours ran\r\nthrough the French lines that Hill had advanced to Plasencia or the\r\nbridge of Almaraz.\r\n\r\nBehind the long front that lay between D’Urban’s horse at Braganza and\r\nErskine’s horse at Brozas, the British army settled down for a very\r\nprotracted period of rest and reorganization--it was to be much longer\r\nthan Wellington had intended, owing to unforeseen chances. The Spanish\r\nauxiliary forces which had marched with the Allies in the autumn also\r\ndispersed: Castaños led the Army of Galicia back from the Agueda to\r\nits own country, by a long march through the Tras-os-Montes. Carlos de\r\nEspaña put part of his division as a garrison in Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nlay with the rest in the mountain villages of the Sierra de Francia.\r\nMorillo, sticking close to Hill’s side, as he had done all through\r\n1812, went back with him to the South, and wintered once more in\r\nEstremadura, at Caçeres and the neighbouring places.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, King Joseph and Marshal Soult had also to place\r\ntheir armies--as worn out as were those of their enemy--in winter\r\nquarters. And the choice of theirs was a much more difficult problem\r\nthan that which lay before Wellington, since King Joseph had to settle\r\nnot only a military but a political problem. The whole fabric of the\r\nFrench occupation of Spain had been dashed to pieces in the preceding\r\nsummer by the loss of Andalusia, the temporary occupation of Madrid\r\nby the Allies, and the advance of the Anglo-Portuguese Army as far as\r\nBurgos. It had now to be reconstructed--but on what lines? There was\r\nclearly no possibility of reoccupying Andalusia or Estremadura: to do\r\nso would have involved a winter campaign--which was unthinkable--and\r\nan intolerable dispersion of the army which had been collected with so\r\nmuch difficulty for the repression of Wellington. The real alternatives\r\npossible were either (1) to reconstruct King Joseph’s Spanish kingdom,\r\nas it had existed in the spring of 1812, minus Andalusia, making Madrid\r\nthe political capital and the military base of operations, or (2)\r\nto recognize that the total strength of the French armies no longer\r\nsufficed for such an ambitious scheme, and to occupy in strength\r\nonly Old Castile and Leon, with the provinces beyond the Ebro, making\r\nValladolid both the political and the military centre of operations,\r\nand abandoning Madrid altogether, or only holding it as an advanced\r\npost towards the south, on the extreme limit of French occupation.\r\n\r\nAfter much debate Joseph and Jourdan chose the former plan, influenced\r\nmainly, as the Marshal writes in his Memoirs, by the fact that to\r\ngive up Madrid as the capital, and to remove to Valladolid, would be\r\na death-blow to the prestige of the Franco-Spanish monarchy. It would\r\nmatter little whether Madrid were actually abandoned, or held as a\r\nprecarious outpost: in either case Joseph could no longer pretend\r\nto be King of Spain[256]. In addition it must be remembered that to\r\ngive up New Castile and La Mancha would leave Suchet in a position of\r\nisolation at Valencia, far too much advanced, and quite out of touch\r\nwith the other armies, and also that from the administrative point of\r\nview Joseph had always regarded the revenues which he drew from Madrid\r\nand New Castile as the only solid part of his very modest and irregular\r\nbudget. That a great error of choice was made is undoubted; but its\r\nruinous nature was only to be revealed by circumstances which the King\r\nand the Marshal could not possibly have foreseen on November 20, 1812.\r\nWhen they made their decision neither they nor any one at Paris, or\r\nelsewhere in Western Europe, had a notion of the awful _débâcle_ which\r\nwas in progress in Russia. Napoleon had evacuated Moscow a month back;\r\nhe was now in disastrous retreat from Smolensk toward the Berezina,\r\nwith an army that was already crumbling under his hands. But that\r\nthe whole of it was destined to perish during the next few days, and\r\nthat France was to be left unguarded by any _Grande Armée_ when the\r\nnew year came, seemed an incredible contingency. Joseph and Jourdan\r\nexpected to draw from the Emperor drafts and reinforcements in 1813, as\r\nthey had even in 1812. If they had guessed that, instead, he would be\r\ndrawing drafts and reinforcements from them, they would have adopted\r\na different policy. But the celebrated ‘29th Bulletin’ was published\r\nin Paris only on December 3rd, and did not get to Madrid till January\r\n6th,[257] and even that dismal document did not reveal the full extent\r\nof the ruin. It was not, indeed, till private letters from survivors\r\nof the Moscow retreat began to drift in, three weeks later, that the\r\nFrench head-quarters in Spain realized what the month of November had\r\nmeant in Russia.\r\n\r\nIt was quite natural, then, that King Joseph should have made up\r\nhis mind, at the end of the Burgos retreat, that he would occupy so\r\nmuch of the regained regions as was possible, and would make Madrid\r\nonce more his residence and the centre of his operations. He was\r\nright in believing that he had at least four months before him for\r\nreorganization and reconstruction: Wellington was too hard hit to be\r\nable to move before April at the earliest.\r\n\r\nIt was some weeks before the King was able to spread the three French\r\narmies in the final positions which he had chosen for them. He left\r\nSalamanca himself at the head of his Guard on November 23rd, and\r\nmoved on Madrid by way of Peñaranda, Arevalo and the Guadarrama Pass.\r\nHe reached the capital on December 2nd, to find that it had been\r\noccupied a few days after he had left it on his march to Salamanca\r\nby the Empecinado and his _partida_[258]. The guerrillero chief had\r\nadministered the city with the aid of an extemporized junta for\r\nmore than three weeks[259]. On the approach of the King he retired,\r\ntaking with him some citizens who had compromised themselves in\r\nthe patriotic cause. Joseph, however, showed himself particularly\r\ngracious on his return, and endeavoured to produce an impression of\r\nthe restored solidity of his régime, by holding court functions,\r\nreopening the theatres, and visiting hospitals and public institutions.\r\nThe demonstration had little effect, all the more because it was\r\naccompanied by increased market-dues and the collection of arrears of\r\ntaxation. It was impossible to persuade the Madrileños that the King’s\r\nreturn was for good, and confidence in his power was never restored.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Army of the Centre reoccupied the provinces of\r\nSegovia and Guadalajara with the northern part of that of Toledo.\r\nWhile crossing the Guadarrama a few days after the King, its leading\r\ndivision was caught in a blizzard similar to that which, on the same\r\nspot, had impeded Napoleon on December 22nd, 1808, and lost a hundred\r\nmen frozen or buried in the snow[260]. Soult was directed to place\r\nhis head-quarters at Toledo, and to occupy that province and Avila,\r\nwith so much of La Mancha as he thought proper. The Army of Portugal\r\nwas allotted the provinces of Zamora, Leon, Salamanca, Palencia, and\r\nValladolid, with head-quarters at the last-named city. The front\r\ntowards Portugal and Galicia was held by one division at Leon, another\r\nat Zamora, and two at Salamanca, the rest of the eight divisions of\r\nthis army being écheloned in reserve at various points in Old Castile.\r\nBut at the end of December the King determined that there must be a\r\nshifting of cantonments, in order to tighten up his connexion with\r\nSuchet at Valencia. He ordered Soult to send a division to Cuenca, as a\r\nhalf-way house to the East Coast. To enable him to spare these troops\r\nhe was relieved of the charge of the province of Avila, which was taken\r\nover by Foy, with the 1st Division of the Army of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the French occupation in central and northern Spain at\r\nthe commencement of the new year, 1813, may best be defined by a list\r\nof the Divisional head-quarters of the armies, which were, on January\r\n15, Army of the South, 1st Division (Leval), Toledo[261]; 3rd Division\r\n(Villatte), Talavera; 4th Division (Conroux), Madridejos; 5th Division\r\n(Pécheux), Daymiel in La Mancha; 6th Division (Daricau), San Clemente\r\nin the province of Cuenca. Of the cavalry Pierre Soult’s light horse\r\nand Digeon’s dragoons were in a forward position in La Mancha, Tilly’s\r\ndragoons in reserve at Toledo. The effective total of Soult’s army was\r\non this day 36,000 officers and men effective, beside men in hospital\r\nor detached.\r\n\r\nOf the Army of the Centre, Darmagnac’s Division, as also the Royal\r\nGuard, was at Madrid, Cassagne’s Division at Arganda (twenty miles\r\nfarther east), the Franco-Spanish Division of Casapalacios at Segovia,\r\nthe cavalry dispersed at various points in a circle round Madrid. This\r\narmy had just lost Palombini’s Italian Division, which had served with\r\nit during the autumn campaign of 1812. It was on its way to Burgos, to\r\njoin the Army of the North, to which it properly belonged. With this\r\ndeduction the Army of the Centre had still 12,000 French troops, plus\r\nJoseph’s Guards and Spaniards, who must have made up at least 5,000\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe Army of Portugal was much more widely dispersed. It showed the\r\n1st Division (Foy) at Avila, 2nd Division (Barbot) at Valladolid,\r\n3rd Division (Sarrut) at Leon, 4th Division (Fririon) at Saldaña,\r\n5th Division (Maucune) and 8th Division (Chauvel) at Salamanca, with\r\ndetachments at Ledesma and Zamora. The 6th and 7th Divisions, both\r\nweak, were in process of being cut up to strengthen the others, as will\r\nbe explained later, when reorganization is in question. Of the two\r\ncavalry divisions of the Army of Portugal both Boyer’s dragoons, with\r\nhead-quarters at Mayorga, and Curto’s light horse, with head-quarters\r\nat Medina de Rio Seco, were keeping a line of advanced posts on the\r\nEsla, to watch the Spanish army of Galicia. The total effective\r\nstrength, omitting sick, was 42,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe three armies had thus about 95,000 men under arms to cover the\r\nenormous block of territory which they occupied. The distance from\r\nSalamanca to San Clemente is 250 miles; that from Leon to Daymiel 280\r\nmiles. It is clear that a concentration on Madrid or Valladolid would\r\nbe comparatively easy. On the other hand there would be an intolerable\r\ndistance for the Army of the South to cover, if Salamanca were the\r\npoint chosen by an enemy for assault, or for the remoter divisions of\r\nthe Army of Portugal to traverse, if Talavera were selected. But, as\r\nwas obvious, there was no chance of any such blow being delivered at\r\npresent, since Wellington could not possibly stir till the spring,\r\nwhile the Spanish regular forces in Andalusia and Murcia were\r\nnegligible quantities until the Anglo-Portuguese army should be able to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nAll round the position of the French there was at this moment a\r\nbroad ‘no man’s land’; for their farthest outposts were nowhere in\r\ndirect touch with the enemy, but separated from him by many miles of\r\nunoccupied ground, in which neither party kept permanent posts. Between\r\nAstorga--the farthest advanced post of the Galicians--and the line\r\nof the Esla, between Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo, between Avila and\r\nBejar, between Talavera and Coria, between Daymiel and San Clemente\r\nand the northern foot-hills of the Sierra Morena, this broad debatable\r\nland was in possession neither of the French nor of the regular armies\r\nof their enemy, but of the guerrillero bands, under a score of leaders\r\nsmall and great. And the difficulty of the situation for King Joseph\r\nwas that, while Wellington and Castaños and Del Parque and Elio were\r\nquiet perforce at midwinter, the guerrilleros were not. Having ample\r\nspaces of unoccupied border, in which they could take refuge when\r\npursued, and many mountain recesses, even within the zone of French\r\noccupation, where they could lie safe against anything less than a\r\nconsiderable flying column, they seemed to defy extermination. Even\r\nin King Joseph’s most prosperous days, when the final triumph of the\r\nFrench seemed probable, there had always been guerrilleros; but since\r\nWellington’s march to Madrid and Soult’s evacuation of Andalusia, it\r\nno longer looked as if the national cause was hopeless. To collect the\r\narmy which drove Wellington back to Portugal in November every district\r\nin Spain, from Biscay to La Mancha, had been stripped for a time of\r\nits army of occupation. Regions long tamed had been out of hand for\r\nfour or five months, enjoying an unruly and uncomfortable freedom,\r\nin which local juntas and guerrillero chiefs, who took the pose of\r\nmilitary governors, contended for authority. And when the French came\r\nback they found that their old prestige was gone and that it could\r\nonly be restored, if it could be restored at all, by ceaseless acts of\r\nrepression of the most drastic sort. For if any town or village showed\r\nany signs of willing submission, the guerrilleros descended upon it\r\nwhen its garrison was absent, and hung or arrested ‘Afrancesados’:\r\nwhile if the population (as was more usual) showed ill-will and offered\r\npassive resistance, the French imprisoned or shot the magistrates, and\r\nimposed heavy fines for disloyalty[262].\r\n\r\nBut while the whole of northern and central Spain was full of punitory\r\nraids and executions, there was one region where the trouble passed\r\nthe limit of unrest, and could only be called insurrection, where the\r\nFrench garrisons were practically blockaded in their cantonments,\r\nand where the open country was completely out of hand. This was the\r\nsub-Pyrenean district comprising Navarre, the three Basque provinces,\r\nand the mountainous lands between Santander and Burgos. And from\r\nthe strategical point of view this was the most important tract in\r\nall Spain, since the main communication with France lay through its\r\nmidst, by the great road from Madrid to Bayonne through Valladolid,\r\nVittoria, and Tolosa. We have seen in earlier pages that trouble had\r\nbeen endemic in these lands ever since Mina’s appearance in 1810, and\r\nthe permanent establishment of those active partisans, Porlier and\r\nLonga, on the Cantabrian coast-line. The creation of Reille’s ‘Army\r\nof the Ebro’ in 1811 for the special purpose of making an end of the\r\nnorthern bands had failed in its purpose. But things only came to a\r\ncrisis in the summer of 1812, when Sir Home Popham’s operations on the\r\nBiscay coast cleared the French out of most of the smaller ports, and\r\ngave the insurgents for the first time free communication with the\r\nsea, and the inexhaustible supplies of Britain. We have seen in the\r\nlast volume[263] how the co-operation of Caffarelli with Marmont in\r\nthe Salamanca campaign was completely prevented by this diversion, how\r\nLonga and Mendizabal retook Santander and for a space Bilbao, and how\r\nMina held the Governor of Pampeluna blockaded in the strongest fortress\r\nof northern Spain. Caffarelli had recovered Bilbao in August; but when\r\nWellington marched on Burgos in September, and the Army of the North\r\nwas compelled to abandon all other operations, in order to succour\r\nthe retreating Army of Portugal, the capital of Biscay and all the\r\nsurrounding district passed back into the power of the Spaniards. In\r\nthe whole region nothing remained in the hands of the French save the\r\nports of Santoña, Guetaria, and San Sebastian, and a line of fortified\r\nposts along the high road from the Bidassoa to the Ebro. And in Navarre\r\nMina held full possession of the open country, raised the taxes,\r\nestablished courts of justice, and (what appears more strange) set up\r\ncustom-houses on the French frontier, at which he allowed non-military\r\ngoods to pass into Spain on the payment of regular dues[264]. He had\r\nraised his original _partida_ to a strength of nine battalions of\r\ninfantry and two regiments of cavalry, possessed cannon, and had a\r\nmunition factory working at the head of the Pyrenean valley of Roncal.\r\n\r\nBefore Wellington commenced his retreat from the Douro to the\r\nPortuguese frontier, or the armies of Soult and of Souham had joined,\r\nto bring their overpowering force against the Anglo-Portuguese,\r\nSouham, as we have already seen, had released the troops of the Army\r\nof the North, and sent them back by Burgos to the Ebro, in order that\r\nCaffarelli might reoccupy the lost districts, and make safe once\r\nmore the high road from Bayonne to Miranda, and the almost equally\r\nimportant route along the Ebro from Miranda to Saragossa, by which\r\nhe had to keep up his connexion with Suchet and the East Coast.\r\nTurning back from Valladolid on November 1st, the commander of the\r\nArmy of the North spent some time in opening up the high road, on\r\nwhich many convoys were lying blockaded in the garrisons and unable\r\nto move, and not till December was come did he clear Bilbao, and\r\ndrive the coast-land guerrilleros out of all the Biscayan harbour\r\ntowns save Castro-Urdiales, which had been fortified and was firmly\r\nheld. Putting off its siege for a time, he then pushed along the\r\ncoast to relieve Santoña, which had been blockaded for many months by\r\nMendizabal and Longa. He cut his way thither, and threw in a convoy\r\nand reinforcements; but as soon as he was gone the Cantabrians came\r\nback and resumed their former positions around the place. By the end\r\nof the year Caffarelli had done nothing conclusive--some shadow of\r\noccupation had been restored in Biscay, but when this was completed\r\nthe new garrisons had reduced his troops available for active service\r\nto a very modest figure. And on January 7 he had to part with the best\r\nunit of them--the brigade of the Young Guard under Dumoustier, which\r\nhad been left in Spain when all the rest of the Guards went off for\r\nthe Russian campaign in the preceding year. He was also directed to\r\ngive up to their proper owners three provisional regiments composed\r\nof drafts for the armies of Portugal and the South, which had been\r\nintercepted on their way to Valladolid, and used to stop gaps in the\r\nline of communication. In return for these deductions he was told that\r\nhe should be given Palombini’s Italian Division, taken from the Army of\r\nthe Centre, three depleted regiments from the Army of Portugal,[265]\r\nand one from Soult’s Army,[266] which he might fill up with drafts\r\nfrom the Bayonne reserve. But it took some time to move these units\r\nnorthward, and meanwhile Caffarelli was left with no more than 10,000\r\nmovable troops--though the Army of the North was theoretically about\r\n40,000 strong. The Bayonne _chaussée_ was again out of control--so much\r\nso that in January and February there were two complete breaks of some\r\nweeks, during which neither convoys nor couriers could get through\r\nfrom Tolosa to Burgos. Bitter complaints about this interruption of\r\ncommunications are to be found in the correspondence of Napoleon and\r\nKing Joseph. The famous ‘29th Bulletin’ sent off from Paris on December\r\n4th only reached Madrid on January 6th--the Emperor’s order for the\r\nreorganization of the Spanish armies, dispatched on January 4th, came\r\nto hand only on February 16th; and the reply acknowledging its receipt\r\nwas not received in Paris till March 18th![267] It had travelled by the\r\ncircuitous route of Valencia and Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThis was intolerable to both parties, and they joined in placing the\r\nblame for delay on the shoulders of Caffarelli, who was denounced as\r\ndilatory and wanting in energy. Jourdan accused him of deliberate\r\ndisregard of all military obedience. ‘He was ostensibly under the\r\norders of the King, but rarely corresponded with Madrid. When he did\r\nsend a report, he seemed to do so rather as a matter of politeness than\r\nas the duty of a subordinate towards his hierarchical superior[268].’\r\nOn January 14th the Emperor ordered him to quit the command of the\r\nArmy of the North and return to Paris. Transmitting this welcome piece\r\nof news to Joseph, the Minister of War remarked that Caffarelli had\r\ninsufficient numbers, but that ‘with more activity, continuity, and\r\nmethod in his operations he might have been much more successful[269].’\r\nIn his place the Emperor nominated Clausel, who was on sick-leave\r\nin France, but was able to rejoin almost at once. This choice was\r\ngenerally approved, as his operations with the Army of Portugal after\r\nthe battle of Salamanca had won him a well-deserved reputation. But\r\nall concerned, from Paris to Madrid, were destined to discover that it\r\nwas not Caffarelli’s incapacity, but the difficulty of the problem,\r\nthat was responsible for the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in\r\nBiscay and Navarre. The capable Clausel made little more of the game\r\nthan the short-sighted and mediocre officer whom he superseded. But\r\nthis could hardly have been foreseen at midwinter; the fact was not\r\nobvious till May, when (as we shall see) Clausel, though he had been\r\nlent many thousands of troops much wanted elsewhere, had to confess\r\nthat his task was not completed, despite of four months of energetic\r\neffort, countless marches and counter-marches, and a dozen bloody but\r\ninconclusive defeats inflicted on the Northern insurgents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE TROUBLES OF A GENERALISSIMO. WELLINGTON AT CADIZ AND FRENEDA\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving sent his war-worn divisions into winter quarters, where they\r\nwere to remain with little change of billets till the next April,\r\nWellington could turn to the consideration of many political and\r\nmilitary problems for which he had been granted little leisure during\r\nthe long stress of the autumn campaign. He fixed himself down at his\r\nold frontier head-quarters of 1811 and 1812, the village of Freneda\r\nnear the Coa, between Almeida and Fuentes de Oñoro. It was a small and\r\nbleak place: observers often wondered why, with the whole of Portugal\r\nbefore him, he chose it for month-long residence in the worst time\r\nof the year. But in the winter of 1812-13 he remained stationary\r\nthere from the end of November to the latter half of May--save for\r\none rapid excursion to Cadiz and Lisbon, which took him away from\r\nDecember 12th to January 25th--an odd time for cross-country travelling\r\nin the Peninsula. Freneda had no amenities of any kind--save indeed\r\nthat it was in the midst of a good fox-hunting country, a rare thing\r\nin Portugal. The Commander-in-Chief, on returning to his old base of\r\noperations, picked up his pack of hounds, and treated himself not\r\ninfrequently to the one sort of field-sport in which he had a real\r\ndelight. In other respects the village was dull and inconvenient--it\r\ncould only just house his very small general staff; it was by no\r\nmeans a central point among the cantonments of his army; and its\r\nremoteness from Lisbon caused a delay of two or three days in all his\r\ncorrespondence to and from home. The only things to be said in its\r\nfavour were that it was so close to the front line of the army on the\r\nAgueda that there would be no possibility of missing any information\r\nas to hostile movements, and that its remoteness and inaccessibility\r\npreserved the Commander-in-Chief from many interviews with useless and\r\ninconvenient visitors, who would have thronged around him if he had\r\nlodged in Lisbon. The intriguer, the man with a grievance, or the man\r\nwith a job in hand, could not easily get to windy Freneda.\r\n\r\nOnly a steady perusal of Wellington’s Original and Supplementary\r\nDispatches can give the chronicler an idea of the varied nature of his\r\ntroubles and worries, during the winter that followed the Salamanca\r\ncampaign. They were not merely those of an ordinary general in command\r\nof an army: his political position had now grown so important that not\r\nonly did all happenings in the Peninsula fall within his sphere, but\r\nthe Cabinet at home was continually consulting him on questions of\r\ngeneral European importance. And in the months after Napoleon’s Russian\r\n_débâcle_ the politics of Europe came to a crisis, such as had never\r\nbeen seen since first he assumed the Imperial crown. His domination\r\nwas breaking up: his prestige had received a mortal wound: alliances\r\nwere shifting: the wildest enterprises were advocated. There were those\r\nat home who proposed that Wellington should take his Peninsula army\r\nto Germany--or to La Vendée--and others who wanted to saddle him with\r\na large Russian auxiliary force to be brought by sea from Reval or\r\nOdessa. On every scheme, however wild, he had to give his opinion.\r\n\r\nBut, placing in order of importance the many worries that beset\r\nHead-Quarters at Freneda, it would seem that the most constant and\r\nprolific source of trouble was a circumstance which ought rather to\r\nhave lessened than increased Wellington’s military difficulties--if\r\nonly men had been other than they were. It will be remembered that\r\nas early as 1809 the project of making him Generalissimo of all the\r\nSpanish armies had been mooted and rejected[270]. He had expressed his\r\nopinion that Spanish national pride made it impossible. ‘I am much\r\nflattered,’ he had written to the British Minister, ‘by the notion\r\nentertained by some of the people in authority at Seville of appointing\r\nme to the command of the Spanish Armies. I believe it was considered\r\nan object of great importance in England that the Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the British troops should have that situation. But it is one more\r\nlikely to be attained by refraining from pressing it, and leaving\r\nit to the Spaniards themselves to discover the expediency of the\r\narrangement, than by any suggestion on our parts.’\r\n\r\nMuch water had flowed under the bridge since 1809. The appointment had\r\nnot come after Talavera or Bussaco, nor after the horrible disasters of\r\nOcaña, the Sierra Morena, and the surrender of Valencia. But the summer\r\ncampaign of 1812 had at last convinced the Cortes that the British\r\ngeneral, who had so often been criticized and accused of selfishness\r\nand reluctance to risk anything for the common cause of the Allies,\r\nwas the inevitable man. In the full flush of joy and confidence that\r\nfollowed the battle of Salamanca and the triumphal entry into Madrid, a\r\nbill was laid before the Assembly to appoint Wellington generalissimo\r\nof all the Spanish forces. It was supported by most of the leading\r\nmen of the ‘Liberal’ party, introduced by the ex-regent Cisgar, and\r\nbarely opposed by the ‘Serviles’, though one clerical member--Creux,\r\nafterwards Archbishop of Tarragona--raised objections to giving such\r\na command to any foreigner, and expatiated on the selfish character\r\nof British commercial policy. Despite of such murmurs, the motion\r\nwas carried by an immense majority, and the President of the Cortes\r\nwas authorized to direct the Council of Regency to make the offer to\r\nWellington. The form of words ran that considering the advantages of\r\nunity in command, and the urgent necessity for utilizing to the full\r\nthe recent glorious triumphs of the allied arms, it was decreed that\r\nas long as the allied forces were co-operating in the defence of the\r\nPeninsula ‘Captain-General the Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo’ should have\r\nconferred upon him the supreme command of all of them, to be exercised\r\nin accordance with general orders, his authority to extend over all the\r\nprovinces of the Peninsula. And the ‘illustrious chief’ was directed to\r\ncorrespond with the National Government through the Secretary of the\r\nWar Office[271].\r\n\r\nThis decree reached Wellington on October 2, while he lay at Villatoro,\r\nconducting the siege of Burgos. He resolved to take up the long-delayed\r\ncommission, provided that he should receive the permission of the\r\nPrince Regent to do so, and sent, through his brother at Cadiz, a\r\nletter of conditional acceptance. His consent to serve was not couched\r\nin very enthusiastic terms: being anxious to do all that could be\r\ndone to support the legitimate quarrel of the Spanish nation with\r\nFrance, he had no objection to taking upon himself the additional\r\nlabour and responsibility of commanding the Spanish armies. The delay\r\nwhich must be required, for getting leave from the Prince Regent to\r\nmake a formal acceptance of the offer, seemed to him of secondary\r\nimportance, because he was already in the habit of communicating his\r\ngeneral views on operations to the Spanish generals, and of making\r\nsuggestions to them, which always received the utmost attention. ‘I am\r\nconvinced they will continue the same practice, even though I am not\r\ninvested with the supreme command.’ These phrases look like deliberate\r\nsarcasm, considering Wellington’s former relations with Cuesta, Del\r\nParque, Blake, and Mendizabal. But they probably mean no more than that\r\nthe present commanders of the forces which were actually co-operating\r\nwith him in 1812, Castaños, Morillo, and Carlos de España, had been\r\nloyal and obliging. Finally, ‘he hopes that in the new and prominent\r\nsituation in which he is to be placed, he will have not only the full\r\nsupport but the confidence of the Spanish Government, Cortes, and\r\nnation[272].’\r\n\r\nThe inner meaning of these somewhat double-edged phrases is explained\r\nin a memorandum for Lord Bathurst, the British Secretary of State\r\nfor War, which was sent home under the same cover as the Cadiz\r\ndocument[273]. It was eminently not a letter to be shown to Spaniards,\r\nand contained some of the most bitter expressions concerning them which\r\nWellington ever penned. No use could be got out of their armies, he\r\nwrote, unless they were under his control. They had lost nearly all\r\ntheir guns and cavalry, and generally could not act in bodies separate\r\nfrom the Allied Army. Their discipline, equipment, and organization\r\nwas as bad as ever: yet if put in line with his own troops they might\r\nbehave quite well. He would prevent by good management repetitions\r\nof those terrible disasters to individual armies which had so often\r\nhappened in past years. But his power over them must be made real,\r\nand for that purpose he intended to apply the financial screw. All\r\nsubsidies advanced by the British Government to Spain must for the\r\nfuture be expended wholly on such Spanish troops as were actually\r\nemployed in co-operation with the Anglo-Portuguese army, or else those\r\ntroops would become a fresh burden on the military chest. And in his\r\nletter to Cadiz he had been careful to show that he did not intend\r\nto allow the Spanish Government to dictate a military policy to him,\r\nbecause they had placed their troops at his disposition.\r\n\r\nThese letters, sent off from the camp before Burgos on October 5,\r\ngot to London on October 20, and the Prince Regent’s approbation of\r\nWellington’s acceptance of the offer from the Cortes was granted at\r\nonce[274]. The dispatch conveying it was delivered at Cadiz on the 17th\r\nof November, and on the 20th the Cortes confirmed its former decree,\r\nand sent off a formal warrant of appointment to the new generalissimo,\r\nwhich reached him at Freneda on December 4th. The confirmation was\r\nnot made with such general approval as the original appointment--and\r\nfor good reason. By this time it had become evident that Wellington\r\nwas not about to drive the French over the Pyrenees: he had raised\r\nthe siege of Burgos, and when the Cortes repeated their vote, was\r\nknown to be in full retreat for Salamanca. Hopes from his success\r\nwere no longer so high as they had been in September, and a nasty jar\r\nhad been given to the whole arrangement by the mutinous conduct of\r\nBallasteros, who (as has been shown in an earlier chapter) had issued a\r\nmanifesto against all submission to foreign generals, and had refused\r\nto obey Wellington’s directions at a critical moment. It is true that\r\nBallasteros had been arrested and imprisoned, without any consequent\r\ntrouble[275]; but it was known that there were other Spanish generals\r\nwho were not without sympathy with his views.\r\n\r\nHaving received his formal nomination as generalissimo, Wellington\r\nwrote to Carvajal, the Minister of War, on December 4th, one of the\r\nmost stringent letters that any secretary of state has ever received.\r\nIt reminds the reader of one of Napoleon’s epistles to Clarke or King\r\nJoseph. The Spanish Government, he said, had now a right to expect from\r\nhim an accurate representation of facts, and he was going to perform\r\nthis duty. The discipline of the Spanish armies was in the very lowest\r\nstate; their efficiency was much deteriorated. How could any army be\r\nexpected to keep order when neither officers nor men had received\r\nany pay for months--or even for years? But it was not financial\r\narrears that explained all defects: even in corps--like those of the\r\nGalician and Estremaduran armies--which had recently been re-clothed\r\nand regularly paid by Wellington’s own exertions, insubordination and\r\nindiscipline were rife: they were as little to be depended upon in\r\nthe field as the rest. The officers, with some few exceptions, were\r\nabsolutely slack and careless: the desertion from the ranks immense.\r\nHe had hesitated at accepting the command, when he thought of what he\r\nhad seen of the Spanish troops of late. But having undertaken it, he\r\nwould not relinquish the task because it was laborious and of doubtful\r\nsuccess. There were four demands which he must make as a preliminary\r\ncondition: the Government must give him power--\r\n\r\n(1) To have under his control all promotions and appointments to\r\ncommand;\r\n\r\n(2) To dismiss from the service any officer whom he thought deserving\r\nof such punishment;\r\n\r\n(3) To apply the whole war-budget to such services as he might choose;\r\n\r\n(4) To appoint to his head-quarters a Spanish chief-of-the-staff, to\r\nwhom all military reports from the whole kingdom should be sent: so\r\nthat nothing should take place without his knowledge. Through this\r\nofficer he would correspond with the Regency, and send them regular\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to definite demands as to administration. The\r\npresent state of military organization was absurd, burdensome, and\r\nexpensive. The realm was overrun with unnecessary army-commanders\r\nand captain-generals, with immense and useless staffs. ‘For example,\r\nGeneral Castaños is most usefully employed as commander of the 5th\r\nArmy, whose territory consists of Estremadura and Castile. But there\r\nis a captain-general and a large staff in each of these provinces,\r\nthough the troops in the former are not enough to make a full garrison\r\nfor Badajoz, or those in the latter to make a full garrison for Ciudad\r\nRodrigo[276].’ The captain-generals and their staffs have nothing to\r\nadminister, are quite useless, and absorb money which should go to the\r\narmy. In the same way the 2nd (Valencian) and 3rd (Murcian) Armies,\r\ntogether have a strength equivalent to two divisions, yet have each the\r\nfull military and civil staff of a complete army[277]. So has the 9th\r\n(Cantabrian) Army, which is composed entirely of guerrillero bands.\r\nOnly the Andalusian and Galician troops are sufficiently numerous to be\r\nworth calling armies at all.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to cut down unnecessary commanders-in-chief\r\nand staffs. The Galician, Castilian, and Estremaduran commands\r\nshould be at once amalgamated, and put under Castaños, with one\r\nsingle staff for all three. Probably the same should be done with\r\nthe Andalusian, Murcian, and Valencian commands. An immense body of\r\nsuperfluous staff-officers must be sent back to Cadiz at once. As a\r\nsecond step he would have to revise the organization of the country\r\ninto captain-generalships and intendancies. Captain-generals often\r\nhampered army-commanders; intendants must probably be put under\r\nmilitary authority. This was no doubt wrong in principle. But the civil\r\nintendant was powerless, in a country just liberated from the enemy\r\nand full of trouble and disorder. He could not exert authority unless\r\nhe were lent military assistance: yet he would probably fall out with\r\nthe military chief, because their ends would be divergent[278]. ‘When\r\nthe enemy is still in the country that must be done which tends most\r\ndirectly to drive him out--whatever constitutional principles may be\r\nviolated in the process[279].’\r\n\r\nFinally, Wellington resolved that he must come down to Cadiz in\r\nperson to urge his schemes of reorganization on the Regency and the\r\nCortes--obviously a most invidious task, since no nation likes to have\r\nadministrative reforms thrust upon it by a foreigner--more especially\r\nby a foreigner whose tone is dictatorial and whose phrases seem almost\r\ndeliberately worded so as to wound national pride.\r\n\r\nOn December 12th he started out to deal with the Cadiz bureaucrats,\r\nplanning to cover the whole 300 miles from Freneda in six days. As\r\na matter of fact he took eleven, partly because he was smitten with\r\nlumbago, which made riding painful, partly because he was delayed\r\none night in the Pass of Perales, and two at Albuquerque, by floods,\r\nwhich made mountain-streams impassable for many hours. Immediately on\r\nreaching the seat of government, where he was received with great state\r\nif with little real cordiality, he started on his campaign against the\r\nRegency, the Cortes, and the Minister of War. It is much to the credit\r\nof the Spaniards that, though many of his demands were unpalatable, the\r\ngreater part of them were conceded with slight variation of terms. It\r\nis curious to note the points on which the Regency proved recalcitrant\r\nand started argument. Of the four great preliminary conditions which\r\nWellington exacted, they granted at once that which seemed the most\r\nimportant of all--the creation of a Spanish chief-of-the-staff to be\r\nattached to Wellington’s head-quarters, and conceded that all military\r\ncorrespondence should pass through his hands. The person selected was\r\nGeneral Wimpffen, a Spanish-Swiss officer, of whom we have had to speak\r\noccasionally in dealing with Catalonian affairs--he had been Henry\r\nO’Donnell’s adjutant-general in 1810. He was a non-political soldier\r\nof good abilities, and Wellington found him laborious and obliging:\r\nthere seems never to have been any friction between them. Secondly, the\r\nRegency granted the great point that the whole British subsidy should\r\nbe applied to such military expenses as Wellington should designate:\r\nand they afterwards went so far as to order that in the recovered\r\nprovinces nine-tenths of the taxes raised should be devoted to military\r\npurposes. But they haggled on the two conditions dealing with military\r\npatronage. Instead of giving the generalissimo power to revise all\r\nappointments, they proposed that ‘no officer should be promoted to\r\na chief command, or the command of a division, or any extraordinary\r\ncommand, except at the recommendation of the general-in-chief. With\r\nregard to other promotions the rules of the Spanish service shall\r\nbe strictly observed.’ This left all patronage from the rank of\r\nbrigadier-general downward in the hands of the Minister of War and the\r\nCortes. And whereas Wellington had proposed, as his second condition,\r\nthat he should have power to cashier any officer whom he considered\r\ndeserving of such punishment, the Regents offered him only the right of\r\nsuspending and sending away from the army in the field officers guilty\r\nof grave misconduct[280].\r\n\r\nIt is clear that these variations on the original proposals had two\r\nmain objects. The Spaniards evidently thought that if Wellington\r\nhad every officer down to the lowest under his thumb, liable to be\r\ncashiered without any appeal, he might use this tremendous power to\r\nstock the whole army with men of one political colour, and make it into\r\na machine quite independent of the Government, and capable of being\r\nturned against it. And similarly there was a great difference between\r\nthe right to send an officer away from the front, and the right to\r\ndrive him out of the army. To be put on half-pay, or on administrative\r\nduty in some office at Cadiz, was a much less terrible fate than\r\ncashiering.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that many Spaniards thought Wellington capable\r\nof aiming at a military dictatorship, to which he might be helped by\r\ngenerals who were considered Anglophils, such as Castaños, his nephew\r\nand chief-of-the-staff Giron, or Morillo. And others believed that\r\nBritish policy secretly desired the seizure of Cadiz and Minorca and\r\nthe reduction of Spain to a Protectorate. Now if there had been any\r\ntruth in these absurd suspicions, there is no doubt that the powers\r\nwhich Wellington demanded would have given him the chance of carrying\r\nout such designs. And there were an infinite number of Spanish\r\nofficers, from generals like La Peña down to petty governors and\r\nmembers of provincial staffs, who had come into direct contact with\r\nWellington, and knew his unflattering opinion of them. All these men in\r\ndisgrace, or disgruntled placemen, thought that the new generalissimo\r\nwould start his career by a general cashiering of those against whom he\r\nhad an old grudge.\r\n\r\nHence pressure was brought to bear upon the Regents and the Cortes\r\nfrom many and diverse quarters, with the common plea that there must\r\nbe no British military dictatorship, and that Spanish officers must be\r\nprotected from possible persecution and oppression. The underlying idea\r\nwas that if the mass of the middle and lower grades in the army were\r\nout of Wellington’s supervision, it did not matter so much who held\r\nthe post of army-commander or captain-general. For the chiefs, though\r\nin influential posts, were few, and would not be able to carry their\r\nsubordinates with them in any unpopular movement dictated to them by\r\nthe generalissimo.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion, and with reluctance[281], Wellington accepted\r\nthe modifications--thinking that the other things conceded gave him\r\npractically all that he needed. He was to find out his error in\r\nthe year that followed. He had not guarded himself against seeing\r\nofficers with whom he was satisfied removed from his field-army under\r\nthe pretence of promotion, or of transference to other duties, or of\r\npolitical offences. He had forgotten to demand that he should have\r\nthe power of _retaining_ as much as that of _dismissing_ generals. In\r\nthis way he was deprived of the services of Castaños and afterwards\r\nof Giron, both of whom he was anxious to keep. Successors technically\r\nunobjectionable, whom he had no wish to ‘blackball,’ were substituted\r\nfor them, to his deep regret. And another evasion of his intention\r\nwas that officers whom he had intended to disgrace, and had removed\r\nfrom the front, were given posts elsewhere which could not be called\r\n‘divisional’ or ‘separate’ commands, but were quite desirable; and so\r\nwhile the letter of the bargain was kept, the purpose of inflicting\r\npunishment on such people was foiled.\r\n\r\nAnother long controversy was provoked by Wellington’s proposal\r\nthat the small armies should be amalgamated, and that unnecessary\r\ncaptain-generals with their staffs should be got rid of. Much but\r\nnot all of what he asked was conceded. The Murcian and Valencian\r\narmies were consolidated, and given the new name of the ‘Second\r\nArmy’--the Catalan army being still the ‘First Army’. But they were\r\nnot amalgamated with the Andalusian command (now the ‘Third Army’),\r\nas Wellington suggested. And similarly the Estremaduran, Castilian,\r\nand Galician armies, with the outlying Cantabrian division, ceased to\r\nbe the 5th, 6th, and 7th Armies, and took the new name of the Fourth.\r\nAnd a great reduction of staffs and removal of contending military\r\nauthorities was procured, by nominating Elio, commander of the new 2nd\r\nArmy, to be Captain-General of Murcia and Valencia, Del Parque of the\r\n3rd Army to be Captain-General of Granada and Jaen, and Castaños to be\r\nCaptain-General alike of Estremadura, Galicia, and Castile. This was\r\nall to the good, but the Cortes refused Wellington’s other proposal,\r\nthat the civil government in each province should be placed under the\r\ncontrol of the army-commanders. Declaring that it was constitutionally\r\nimpossible to abolish the independence of the civil power, the Cortes\r\nyet conceded that the _jefe político_ (or provincial prefect) and the\r\nIntendant should obey the Captain-General ‘in all matters relating to\r\nthe Army[282],’ also that nine-tenths of the revenue in each province\r\nshould be allocated to the military budget. This would have worked\r\nif all parties concerned had been both willing and competent; but\r\nit remained a melancholy fact throughout the next campaign that the\r\narmy-commanders could seldom get either money or food from the civil\r\nauthorities, and that most essential operations were delayed by the\r\nabsolute impossibility of moving large bodies of men without adequate\r\nmagazines or a fair supply of money. The only regular income of the\r\narmy was that drawn from the British subsidy.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of Wellington’s troubles were yet some months ahead.\r\nThe Regency with which he had made his bargain[283] was displaced in\r\nMarch 1813, and succeeded by another. The Cortes was jealous of the\r\nExecutive, and had determined to make for itself a supreme authority\r\nwhich should have neither brains nor energy. The subject of quarrel\r\nchosen was the old Regency’s alleged slackness in carrying out a recent\r\nAct which had abolished that moribund abuse the Inquisition[284].\r\nAfter an all-night sitting and a vote of censure, the Regents were\r\ndismissed, and replaced by a group appointed under an absurd principle\r\nborrowed from the old régime, which was applied because it suited the\r\ndesires of the assembly for the moment. It was composed of the three\r\nsenior members of the Council of State--senility and weakness being\r\ndesired. These were the Cardinal Bourbon--Archbishop of Toledo--an\r\naged scion of the royal house, and the Councillors Pedro Agar and\r\nGabriel Cisgar, who had been Regents before, but had been got rid of\r\nfor incompetence. Thus all real power went to the Chamber itself--the\r\nRegency having become a negligible quantity. Wellington’s position was\r\ndecidedly impaired by the change--largely because a new minister-of-war\r\nhad come into office, General Juan O’Donoju, of whom he had an evil\r\nmemory as Cuesta’s chief-of-the-staff during the Talavera campaign.\r\nThis clever, shifty, and contentious Irish-Spanish officer broached\r\nthe theory that the agreement of December 1812 did not bind the new\r\nRegents, because they had never assented to it, and because it was\r\ncontrary to the spirit of the Constitution that a foreigner should have\r\nthe power to appoint or dismiss Spanish generals.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry Wellesley at Cadiz, instructed by his brother, turned his\r\nheaviest diplomatic batteries[285] upon the Regents, and privately\r\nwarned the leading members of the Cortes of the awkward results that\r\nwould follow the repudiation of the agreement, O’Donoju was disavowed\r\nbut not displaced. He continued to give perpetual trouble through the\r\nfollowing summer by his persistent intrigues. Wellington was by no\r\nmeans satisfied with the attempts that were made to propitiate him,\r\nby the formal recognition of his status as generalissimo by the new\r\nRegents, and the gift of a great estate in Granada, the royal domain of\r\nSoto de Roma, which had been usurped by Godoy. He did not want grants\r\nbut real authority. Of his future troubles we shall have to speak in\r\ntheir proper place.\r\n\r\nThe most enduring of them was provincial maladministration, which\r\nrendered so many of his orders futile. For usually when he directed\r\na division to move, he was informed that it was destitute of both\r\nmunitions and transport[286]. And changes of organization were often\r\nmade against his protests--e. g. a new army regulation cut down all\r\nregimental formations to a single battalion of very heavy strength\r\n(1,200 bayonets). Wellington would have preferred a two-battalion\r\nformation, in which the second unit should act as a dépôt and feeder\r\nto the first[287]. He complained that if a regiment was badly cut\r\nup in action, there would be no machinery for keeping it up to a\r\ndecent average. The experience of the British army with regard to\r\nsingle-battalion corps had been conclusive against the system for\r\nthe last five years of Peninsular service. But his protests were\r\nvain--internal organization of units did not come within the wording of\r\nhis powers as generalissimo, and the new organization continued, dozens\r\nof second battalions being scrapped.\r\n\r\nThe net result was that, when Wellington took the field in May 1813,\r\nhe only had with him two of Castaños’s divisions and three of those\r\nof the Army of Galicia--less than 25,000 men. The Andalusian ‘Army of\r\nReserve,’ which had been promised to him, started late for want of\r\norganization, moved slowly for want of magazines, and only reached the\r\nfront when the battle of Vittoria had been won and the French had been\r\nexpelled from Spain[288]. The Cortes had at least 160,000 men under\r\narms; not a sixth part of them were available during the decisive\r\noperations. But of this more in its proper place.\r\n\r\nPortugal, as usual, contributed its share to the troubles of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, though they were but trifling compared to the\r\nSpanish problems. The Prince Regent at Rio de Janeiro was an expensive\r\nperson, who actually at the worst of the war drew money out of Portugal\r\nfrom the Braganza private domains, though he had all the revenues of\r\nBrazil to play with[289]. Moreover, he had a tiresome habit of sending\r\nincompetent hangers-on to Europe, with a request that berths might\r\nbe found for them. But he was not actively noxious--the same could\r\nnot be said of his wife, the Spanish princess Carlotta, who was still\r\nharping on her natural claim to be Regent of Spain on behalf of her\r\nimprisoned brother Ferdinand, and still interfered from time to time\r\nat Cadiz, by ordering the small knot of deputies who depended on her\r\nto attack the existing regency, or to vote in incalculable ways on\r\nquestions of domestic politics. Fortunately she was so great a clerical\r\nand reactionary that the ‘Liberal’ majority in the Cortes had secretly\r\nresolved that she should never get into power. When the old regency was\r\nevicted in March 1813, it was suspected that the Cardinal Bourbon was\r\nput at the head of the succeeding body mainly because the presence of a\r\nprince of the blood in the Executive seemed to make it unnecessary to\r\nimport another member of the royal house. For this small mercy Henry\r\nWellesley wrote a letter of thanksgiving to his brother at the front.\r\nIt was fortunate that the Prince Regent himself gave no encouragement\r\nto his wife’s ambitions, being as indolent as she was active, and very\r\njealous of her secret intrigues with foreigners. At one time during\r\nthe winter of 1812-13 she showed an intention of departing for Europe,\r\nbut with the assistance of the British ambassador João succeeded in\r\nfrustrating her scheme for appearing at Cadiz in person to claim her\r\nsupposed rights.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the civil government of Portugal continued to be directed by\r\nthe existing Council of Regency, of whom the majority were honest if\r\nnot always well-advised. It is true that Wellington’s old enemies[290]\r\nthe Patriarch of Lisbon and the Principal Sousa still remained members\r\nof it: the determination to evict them which he had declared in 1810\r\nwas never carried out--the one was so powerful from his position in\r\nthe Church, the other from the influence of the widespread Sousa\r\nfamily, that in the end he left them undisturbed. They were perhaps\r\nless dangerous in the Regency than out of it, with their hysterical\r\nappeals to narrow national sentiment, protests against the doings of\r\ntheir colleagues, and perpetual intrigues. A _frondeur_ is partly\r\nmuzzled when he holds office. And in practical administration they\r\nwere steadily voted down by the majority of the Regency, consisting\r\nof the Marquis of Olhão, the Conde de Redondo[291], Dr. Nogueira, and\r\nlast but not least the British Minister Sir Charles Stuart, whose\r\npresence on the board was perhaps necessary, but certainly very trying\r\nto Portuguese _amour-propre_. The three native regents were genuine\r\npatriots, and good friends of the alliance, but a little antiquated in\r\ntheir views as to administration and finance. The Secretary of State,\r\nMiguel Forjaz, to whom so many of Wellington’s letters are addressed,\r\nwas a much more modern personage with a broader intelligence: indeed,\r\nWellington considered him on the whole the most capable statesman in\r\nthe Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThere were two standing sources of friction between the British army\r\nand the Portuguese Regency--both inevitable, and both tiresome from the\r\npoint of view of the necessary _entente_ between two allied nations.\r\nThe more irritating but less important was trouble caused by the daily\r\nmovement of troops, especially troops in small bodies, or individual\r\nofficers. A perusal of the records of many scores of courts martial,\r\nas well as of the correspondence of Wellington and Beresford, leads\r\nto the conclusion that there were grave faults on both sides. Parties\r\nof British soldiers on the march, when unaccompanied by an officer,\r\nwere given to the illegal ‘embargoing’ of carts or mules, to the\r\nextortion of food by force or threats, to mishandling of the peasantry\r\nwhen denied what they asked: occasionally they went so far as acts\r\nof murder or arson[292]. And it cannot be denied that individual\r\nofficers of unsatisfactory type were occasionally guilty of gross\r\nmisconduct--drunken orgies, wanton disregard of legal authority in\r\nrequisitions, even acts of insult or assault on local magistrates[293].\r\nOn the other hand, the provocation was often considerable--there were\r\nplenty of cases established of the denial of legal billets, which\r\nkept parties waiting in the rain for hours, of wanton incivility,\r\nof attempts at extortion in prices, of actual highway robbery[294],\r\nand false accusations brought up to cover neglect of duty. One\r\nof Wellington’s main complaints was that he had to waste time in\r\ninvestigating imaginary outrages, which, on inquiry, turned out to\r\nhave been invented to serve as countercharges against accusations of\r\nslackness or misfeasance. He was determined that outrages by the army\r\nshould cease--indeed, he hanged, first and last, some fifty soldiers\r\nfor plunder accompanied with violence, an offence which he would never\r\npardon. But the Portuguese magistrates were prone to make accusations,\r\nand then to protest against having to support them by evidence. By a\r\ncurious turn of official pride many of them refused to testify before\r\ncourts martial, or even to send witnesses to appear before such bodies,\r\nstanding to the theory that it was beneath the dignity of a magistrate\r\nto come with evidence before a foreign military tribunal[295]. The\r\nresult of this was that offenders brought up for trial, and often\r\nprobably guilty, had to be acquitted for lack of proof. On the other\r\nhand, accusations, made and supported, were sometimes found to be\r\nentirely groundless--in one supposed murder case, the alleged corpse\r\nwas discovered in perfect health; in another, a magistrate who accused\r\na British officer of assault was found to have been dining with him and\r\nfrequenting his quarters, long after the supposed offence[296].\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese Regency was bound to stand up in defence of its\r\nmagistrates--Wellington, though always ready to punish proved crimes,\r\nwas determined not to take accusation as equivalent to conviction,\r\nmerely because it was preferred by a constituted authority. Hence\r\ncame perpetual friction and recrimination; that things were no worse\r\nwas certainly due to the fact that the commander-in-chief’s iron\r\ndiscipline, and rigorous dealing with his own people, could not fail to\r\nimpress the Portuguese with the fact that he was always trying to be\r\njust.\r\n\r\nThe other and more fundamentally dangerous source of wrangling in\r\nPortugal was finance. There could be no disputing the fact that the\r\npart of the army which was not directly maintained from the British\r\nsubsidy was often six months in arrears of pay, and still more often\r\non the edge of starvation. Portuguese paper money, in which many\r\ntransactions had to take place, and which could be legally used\r\nfor a certain percentage of all army payments, was not only at a\r\nhabitual discount of at least 25 percent., but also fluctuating in\r\nexchange-value from day to day. Hence came all manner of illicit\r\nspeculations by merchants, both British and Portuguese, who were always\r\ntrying to buy Government paper at under its quotation for the day, and\r\nto put it off on others at an exaggerated estimate. The same took place\r\nwith Commissariat Warrants, which unscrupulous brokers bought from\r\nthe ignorant peasantry for a mere song, after setting rumours about\r\nconcerning impending bankruptcy of the state, and then cashed at full\r\nface-value in Lisbon or London.\r\n\r\nThe Regency maintained that all the trouble came from the simple fact\r\nthat the war had placed upon the back of Portugal, a small country,\r\nhalf of whose territory had been wasted by Soult and Masséna in 1809\r\nand 1810, a much greater burden than could be borne. The armed forces\r\nalone--some 50,000 regular troops, and often as many militia in the\r\ngarrisons--were so many hands taken away from agriculture, the only\r\nstaple industry of the land. Money was going out of the realm year by\r\nyear to purchase wheat, because the people could not produce enough to\r\nmaintain their existence. Prices had risen to heights that terrified\r\nthose who remembered pre-war days: the pay of the army was enormous\r\ncompared to the rates before 1808, and much of it was going, under\r\nMarshal Beresford’s system, to the British officers who were now\r\nholding a clear majority of all the senior ranks and commands. All\r\navailable money went to the army, and the civil administration was\r\nstarved. The Regency acknowledged the deplorable state of its finances,\r\nbut could only suggest remedies which had grave inconveniences. Another\r\nBritish loan was asked for; but considering the heavy subsidy that\r\nPortugal was receiving already, the British Government gave little\r\nencouragement to such an idea[297]. The Portuguese minister in London\r\n(the Conde de Funchal, one of the Sousas) suggested a large measure\r\nof confiscation of Church and Crown lands--which could then be sold.\r\nBut this would involve a quarrel with the Church party in Portugal,\r\nwho had been loyal supporters of the British alliance, and probably\r\nwith the Prince Regent also, since he was drawing a private income\r\nfrom the Braganza estates. It might also produce a general shock to\r\nnational credit, for it would deal a blow to the general stability of\r\nsociety, and terrify all landholders. Moreover, it appeared doubtful if\r\npurchasers of Church lands would present themselves: and Crown lands\r\nwere largely uncultivated and worthless tracts in the Alemtejo[298].\r\nThe measure was carried out, indeed, many years later, during the civil\r\nwars of Miguel and Maria; but then it came as a consequence of a purely\r\ndomestic struggle, in which the Church party had taken the beaten side.\r\nThe circumstances of 1813 were entirely different. A third expedient\r\nsuggested was the establishment of a National Bank, after the model\r\nof the Bank of England, which should take over the management of the\r\npublic debt and currency. But credit and guarantees must be at the back\r\nof any such association, and unless the British Government were ready\r\nto become the guarantor (which was impossible) it was hard to see what\r\nnew securities could be found.\r\n\r\nWellington’s panacea for financial distress was not heroic measures\r\nbut careful and honest administration of details. He held that there\r\nwas great slackness and partiality in the raising and collection of\r\ntaxes, and that the amount received could be very largely increased by\r\nthe abolition of abuses. In a very long memorandum, addressed to the\r\nPrince Regent João in April 1813, he launched out into an indictment\r\nof the whole financial system of the realm. ‘The great cities and\r\neven some of the smaller places of the kingdom have gained by the\r\nwar: the mercantile class generally has enriched itself by the great\r\ndisbursements which the army makes in cash: there are individuals in\r\nLisbon and Oporto who have amassed immense sums. The fact is not\r\ndenied that the “tributes” regularly established at Lisbon and Oporto,\r\nand the contribution of ten per cent. on the profits of the mercantile\r\nclass are not really paid to the state.... I have recommended the\r\nadoption of methods by which the taxes might be really and actually\r\ncollected, and merchants and capitalists really pay the tenth of\r\ntheir annual profits as an extraordinary contribution for the war....\r\nIt remains for the Government to explain to your Royal Highness the\r\nreasons why it will not put them in practice--or some other expedient\r\nwhich might render the revenue of the state equal to its expenses.’\r\nHe then proceeds to urge supervision of a Custom House notorious for\r\nletting off powerful importers overlightly, and of the collectors of\r\nland-revenue, who were allowed to keep state balances in their hands\r\nfor months without paying them in to the Treasury[299].\r\n\r\nIn letters to Charles Stuart[300] as a member of the Regency Wellington\r\nlet out in much more unguarded terms. The root of corruption was in\r\nthe mercantile community, who had squared the minor bureaucracy.\r\nThe army and state would have been ruined long ago, but for his own\r\nprotests and insistence, by the jobbers of Lisbon, not only Portuguese,\r\nJews, cosmopolitans of all sorts, but ‘sharks calling themselves\r\nBritish merchants.’ The Government is ‘teased into disapprobation of\r\ngood measures by the merchants, who are interested in their being\r\ndiscontinued. But when it is necessary to carry on an expensive system\r\nof war with one-sixth of the money in specie necessary, we must\r\nconsider questions and adopt measures of this description, and we ought\r\nto have the support and confidence of your Government in adopting them.’\r\n\r\nMaking allowance alike for the difficulties of the Regency, and the\r\nirritation of the much-worried general, it seems fair to say that on\r\nthe one hand Wellington was right in denouncing jobbery and urging\r\nadministrative reforms, but that on the other hand no such reforms,\r\nhowever sweeping, would have sufficed to make both ends balance in\r\nthe revenue of the exhausted kingdom of Portugal. The task was too\r\nheavy--but the eighteenth-century slackness and corruption, which\r\nstill survived in too many corners of the bureaucracy, made it even\r\nheavier than it need have been. It is probable that Wellington’s\r\npalliatives would have failed to make receipts meet expenditure,\r\nhowever hardly the screw might have been turned. But a levy of 10 per\r\ncent. on commercial profits does not look very heavy to the taxpayer of\r\n1921!\r\n\r\nThis is a military not an economic or a financial history; it is\r\nunnecessary to go further into Portuguese problems. The main thing to\r\nbe remembered is that they bulked large in the correspondence of the\r\nharassed chief, who sat writing minutes on all topics, civil no less\r\nthan strategical, in his desolate head-quarters at Freneda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON AND WHITEHALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position which Wellington had won himself by five years of\r\nsuccessful campaigning in the Peninsula was such as no British\r\ncommander since Marlborough had enjoyed. His reputation was now\r\nEuropean; his views, not merely on the Spanish struggle but on the\r\ngeneral politics of the Continent, had to be taken into consideration\r\nby the Ministry. He was no longer an officer to whom orders could be\r\nsent, to be carried out whether he liked them or not. He had become\r\na political personage, whose views must be ascertained before any\r\nwide-reaching decision as to the struggle with Napoleon was taken.\r\nIn 1813 it is not too much to say that he exercised a determining\r\ninfluence not only on the military policy of Britain, but on the whole\r\ncourse of the Great War: as we shall presently see, the triumph of\r\nVittoria had the most marked and direct effect on the action of Russia,\r\nPrussia, and Austria. But even before Vittoria he had asserted his will\r\nin many ways--he had stopped some projects and approved others. The\r\nfactious resignation of his brother Lord Wellesley from the Perceval\r\nCabinet had not impaired his position, nor had the coming into office\r\nof Lord Liverpool, when Perceval perished by the bullet of a crazy\r\nassassin a month after the fall of Badajoz. Wellington’s correspondence\r\nwith the War Minister, Lord Bathurst, in 1813, is as confidential\r\nand amicable on both sides as had been the case when the domineering\r\nWellesley had been in power: with the new Prime Minister, Liverpool,\r\nthere is no trace of any friction whatever--rather every sign of\r\nreciprocal respect.\r\n\r\nBut the position which Wellington had achieved had its drawbacks as\r\nwell as its advantages. Since it had become habitual for the Cabinet\r\nto ask his opinion on high military matters not connected with the\r\nPeninsula, an endless vista of troubles was opened up before him, for\r\n(as always happens in times of exceptional crisis) the Ministry at home\r\nwas being plagued with all manner of solicitations from every quarter\r\nof Europe, to which answers were required.\r\n\r\nWhile Wellington had been trailing back reluctantly from Burgos to\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, Napoleon had been conducting a retreat of a very\r\ndifferent kind from Moscow to the Berezina, a retreat whose character\r\nand consequences were not known in London or in Spain for some weeks\r\nlater. He had left Moscow on October 19th, had dictated the famous\r\n29th Bulletin, acknowledging the wreck of his project and the ruin\r\nof his army, at Molodetchno on December 3rd, and had started on his\r\nheadlong flight to Paris on December 5th, leaving the small remnant of\r\nhis host to perish in the snow. He reached the Tuileries on the night\r\nof December 18th, on the heels of the disastrous bulletin, which his\r\nministers had only received thirty-six hours before, on the preceding\r\nday[301]. In London the fact that the Russian expedition had failed was\r\nwell known by the end of November, but the extent of the failure was\r\nonly realized when the 29th Bulletin got to Lord Liverpool’s hands, by\r\nthe usual smugglers’ route, on December 21st, rather less than five\r\ndays after its arrival in Paris[302].\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister sat down next morning to communicate the fact to\r\nWellington, and to consult him upon the logical consequences. ‘There\r\nhas been,’ he wrote, ‘no example within the last twenty years, among\r\nall the extraordinary events of the French Revolution, of such a\r\nchange of fortune as Bonaparte has experienced during the last five\r\nmonths. The most formidable army ever collected by Bonaparte has been\r\nsubstantially destroyed. It only remains to be ascertained whether he\r\nwill succeed in escaping himself--and with what remnant of an army....\r\nUnder these circumstances the question naturally occurs whether he\r\nwill leave the French army in Spain? We have a report that he has\r\nalready ordered 40,000 men from that country to rejoin him--but it is\r\nonly a report. I am inclined, however, to be of opinion that he will\r\nwithdraw the greater part of his forces from Spain. The only efficient\r\nFrench Army at the present moment in existence is that under Soult:\r\nand whatever it may cost Bonaparte to abandon Spain, I think he will\r\nprefer that alternative to the loss of Germany. I may be wrong in this\r\nspeculation, but give you my reasons, and I am particularly desirous\r\nof calling your attention to this view of the subject, in order that\r\nyou may take the necessary means for obtaining early information of the\r\nmovements of any French divisions toward the frontier, and that you may\r\nconsider what measures may be proper to be adopted if my conjecture\r\nshould be realized[303].’\r\n\r\nThus on the first day after the arrival of the epoch-making bulletin,\r\nand before it was known that Napoleon himself had reached Paris, the\r\ngreat strategical question of the winter of 1812-13 was formulated, and\r\nput before Wellington. Will the French evacuate Spain? and, if so, what\r\nshould be done with the British Army in the Peninsula? There were three\r\npossible contingencies--(1) the Emperor might abandon Spain altogether,\r\nin order to have the nucleus of an army ready for the campaign of 1813\r\nin Germany, or (2) he might not evacuate Spain altogether, but might\r\ncut down his forces there, and order them to stand on the defensive\r\nonly, or (3) he might value his prestige so highly that he would\r\ntake little or nothing in the way of troops from the Peninsula, and\r\nendeavour to make head against the Russians with whatever remnant of an\r\narmy might be left him in the North, with the conscripts of 1813, and\r\nthe levies of the German States--if the latter should remain obedient\r\nto him[304].\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed as if the third and least likely of these three\r\nhypotheses was the correct one. For strange as it might appear,\r\nconsidering what had happened in Russia, Wellington could detect no\r\nsigns of any great body of French troops being moved towards the\r\nPyrenees. So far was this from being the case, that the cantonments\r\nadopted by the enemy in December were so widely spread to the South,\r\nthat the only possible deduction that could be made was that the whole\r\nof the armies of 1812 were being kept in Spain. We now know that the\r\nreason for this was that the communications between Madrid and Paris\r\nwere so bad, that Napoleon’s orders to his brother to draw in towards\r\nthe North, and send large drafts and detachments to France, only\r\nreached their destination in February. For many weeks Wellington could\r\nreport no such movements as Lord Liverpool had expected.\r\n\r\nIt was not till March 10th that the much-desired news began to come\r\nto hand[305], time having elapsed sufficient to allow of King Joseph\r\nbeginning to carry out the Emperor’s orders. On that day Wellington\r\nwas able to send Lord Bathurst intelligence which seemed to prove that\r\nthe second hypothesis, not the third, was going to prove the correct\r\none: i. e. there was about to be a certain deduction from the French\r\narmies in Spain, which would make it unlikely that they would take the\r\noffensive, but nevertheless the main body of them was still to be left\r\nin the Peninsula. Though the enemy had made no move of importance, it\r\nwas certain that Soult and Caffarelli had been recalled to France--the\r\nlatter taking with him the troops of the Imperial Guard, which had\r\nhitherto formed part of the Army of the North. To replace the latter\r\nPalombini’s division had been moved from near Madrid to Biscay. A\r\nlarge draft of artillery had been sent back to France, and twelve (it\r\nwas really twenty-five) picked men for the Imperial Guard from each\r\nbattalion of the Army of Spain. On the other hand, a body of 4,000\r\nmen--probably convalescents or conscripts--had come down from Bayonne\r\nto Burgos[306]. Seven days later a more important general move could\r\nbe detected: not only had Soult gone towards France with a heavy\r\ncolumn of drafts, but the French had evacuated La Mancha, the troops\r\nformerly there having retired north to the province of Avila[307].\r\nAgain, a week later, on March 24th, it became known[308] that the Army\r\nof the Centre had moved up towards the Douro, and that King Joseph\r\nand his Court were about to quit Madrid. A little later this move was\r\nfound to have taken place: the enemy had evacuated a broad stretch of\r\nterritory, and ‘concentrated very much toward the Douro[309].’ On the\r\nsame day an intercepted letter, from General Lucotte at Paris to King\r\nJoseph, let Wellington into the main secrets of the enemy: the General\r\nreported to his master that the Emperor’s affairs were in a bad way,\r\nthat there would be no men and very little money for Spain, and that he\r\nmust make the best of what resources he had. His Imperial Majesty was\r\nin a captious and petulant mood, blaming everything done by everybody\r\nbeyond the Pyrenees, but more especially his brother’s neglect to\r\nkeep open the communication with France and to hunt down the northern\r\ninsurgents[310].\r\n\r\nThis useful glimpse into the mentality of the enemy made it abundantly\r\nclear that Lord Liverpool’s original theory, that Napoleon would\r\nwithdraw his whole army from Spain in order to hold down Germany, was\r\nperfectly erroneous. At the same time, Lucotte’s report coincided\r\nwith all the other indications, in showing that the enemy had been\r\nperceptibly weakened, could count on no further reinforcements, and\r\nmust stand on the defensive during the campaign that was to come.\r\n\r\nBut while it was still thought in Whitehall that the Emperor might\r\nevacuate Spain altogether, various projects for turning the Russian\r\n_débâcle_ to account began to be laid before Wellington. The first\r\nwas a scheme for fostering a possible insurrection in Holland, where\r\ngrave discontent was said to be brewing. Would it be wise for the\r\nPrince of Orange, now serving as an aide-de-camp on the head-quarters\r\nstaff, to be sent home, so that he might put himself at the head of a\r\nrising? Wellington replied that he no more believed in an immediate\r\ninsurrection in Holland than in one in France. ‘Unless I should hear of\r\nan insurrection in France or in Holland, or should receive an order to\r\nsend him, I shall say nothing on the subject to the Prince[311].’ He\r\nwas undoubtedly right in his decision: the Dutch required the news of\r\nLeipzig, still nine months ahead, to make them stir: an expedition to\r\nHolland in the early spring would have been hopelessly premature.\r\n\r\nA little later came a much more plausible proposition, which met with\r\nan equally strong negative from Wellington. The ever-loyal Electorate\r\nof Hanover was prepared to rise: to start the movement it would be only\r\nnecessary to land a nucleus of British-German troops somewhere on the\r\nFrisian coast. Could Wellington spare the three cavalry regiments, five\r\ninfantry battalions, and one battery of the King’s German Legion which\r\nwere serving with him? After Tettenborn’s March raid to Hamburg the\r\ninsurrection actually broke out, and Bathurst suggested[312] that the\r\ntime had come to throw a considerable force ashore in the electorate.\r\nHe asked whether the Hanoverian officers in Spain were beginning to\r\nchafe at being kept so far from their homes at the critical moment.\r\nAgain Wellington put in a strong negative. He had been to consult\r\nGeneral Charles Alten, ‘by far the best of the Hanoverian officers,’\r\nas to the expedience of sending the Legion to Germany. Alten held that\r\n‘the best thing for England, for Germany, and the world, is to make\r\nthe greatest possible effort _here_:’ the services of a few thousand\r\nveteran troops would be important in the narrower field in Spain--they\r\nwould be lost in the multitudes assembling on the Elbe. If a large\r\nbody of loyal levies were collected in Hanover it might ultimately be\r\nwell to send a part of the Legion thither: but not at present[313].\r\nThis was the policy which the Ministry followed: in the spring they\r\ndispatched to North Germany only cadres from the dépôts of the Legion\r\nat Bexhill--500 men in all, including some experienced cavalry and\r\nartillery officers. In July the 3rd Hussars went across to Stralsund,\r\nin August two batteries of Horse Artillery, all from England[314]. But\r\nno deduction of units was made from Wellington’s Spanish army--only a\r\nfew officers were permitted to sail, at their own request. The senior\r\nof them, General Bock of the Heavy Dragoons, unfortunately perished by\r\nshipwreck with his three aides-de-camp off the coast of Brittany in the\r\nwinter that followed Vittoria.\r\n\r\nBathurst was so far right that many of the Hanoverian officers\r\nregretted their stay in the Peninsula: on the other hand, Wellington\r\nwas not merely trying to keep his own army strong, when he refused to\r\nlisten to the suggestions made him. It was perfectly true that 4,000\r\ngood soldiers were an appreciable unit in a Spanish battle--while they\r\nwould be ‘entirely thrown away,’ as he put it, in Germany. The margin\r\nof strength was so narrow in the Peninsular Army that it was not safe\r\nto decrease it.\r\n\r\nThe same question that arose about the King’s German Legion also came\r\nup during the spring of 1813 with regard to the Brunswickers. Many\r\nofficers of the Brunswick-Oels battalion in the 7th Division were fired\r\nwith the idea of liberating Germany--they wrote to their duke, then in\r\nEngland, begging him to have the battalion ordered home. He replied\r\nthat he had tried to get the War Office to let him go to the Elbe, even\r\nwith a small cadre, a few hundred men, but had been refused[315]. It is\r\nmuch more surprising that this corps was not spared from the Peninsula:\r\nWellington had a bad mark against it, for its terrible propensity to\r\ndesertion, and a worse for the behaviour of one of its companies at\r\nTordesillas in the recent campaign. Probably he thought that, if he\r\nsurrendered the Brunswickers, he would have to give up the German\r\nLegion also.\r\n\r\nIt is odd to find that among Wellington’s troubles were not only the\r\nproposed subtraction of troops whom he did not want to lose, but the\r\nproposed addition of troops whom he was not at all anxious to see in\r\nthe Peninsula. The story is one which illustrates the casual methods\r\nof Russian officers. In February there came to Freneda a well-known\r\nBritish secret agent, Mackenzie, the man who had organized the\r\nsuccessful evasion of La Romana’s Spaniards from Denmark in 1808[316].\r\nHe brought letters from Admiral Greig, commanding the Russian Black\r\nSea fleet, to the effect that there was a surplus of troops from\r\nTchitchagoff’s Army of the Danube, which could not be utilized in\r\nGermany for want of transport and supplies. There were 15,000 men who\r\ncould be collected at Odessa and shipped to Spain, to be placed in the\r\nAllied Army, if Wellington would accept them. The memory of Russian\r\nco-operation in Holland in 1799 was not a very happy one: but it seemed\r\nunwise to offend the Tsar, on whose goodwill the future of Europe now\r\ndepended. Wherefore the answer given was that they might come if the\r\nBritish Cabinet approved, and if the Spanish and Portuguese governments\r\nsaw no objection. ‘One would think that the Emperor had demands enough\r\nfor his men,’ wrote Wellington to Charles Stuart, ‘but Mackenzie says\r\nthat they have more men than they can support in the field, which is\r\nnot improbable. The admission of Russians into the Peninsula, however,\r\nis quite a new feature of the war: and it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat the allied Governments should consent to the measure[317].’ The\r\ncorrespondence with Cadiz and London ended in the most tiresome and\r\nridiculous fashion--the Spanish Regency was at the moment in a state\r\nof diplomatic tension with Russia, on some questions of precedence and\r\ncourtesy. It answered in the most downright fashion that the presence\r\nof Russian troops in Spain would be neither helpful nor welcome. The\r\nBritish ambassador at Cadiz was shocked at the language used, which\r\nwould be most offensive to the Tsar[318]. But the whole project\r\nsuddenly collapsed on news received from London. Count Lieven, the\r\nRussian representative at the Court of St. James’s, declared that he\r\nhad never heard of the offer, that he was sure that no such scheme\r\nwould be approved by the Tsar, and that there was certainly no Russian\r\ncorps now available for service in the Mediterranean. Admiral Greig\r\nhad once communicated to him a scheme for a Russian auxiliary force\r\nto be used in Italy--but this was a plan completely out of date, when\r\nthe whole Russian army was wanted for Germany[319]. Wellington had\r\ntherefore to explain to the Spanish and Portuguese Governments that his\r\nproposals to them had been made under a complete misapprehension: his\r\n_amour-propre_ was naturally hurt--Greig and Mackenzie had put him in\r\nan absurd position.\r\n\r\nPrince Lieven’s mention of Italy takes us to another of Wellington’s\r\nworries. It has been mentioned in the preceding volume that Lord\r\nWilliam Bentinck, commanding the British Army in Sicily, had already\r\nin 1812 been planning descents on Italy, where he rightly thought the\r\nFrench military strength was low, after the departure of the whole of\r\nthe Viceroy’s contingent for the Russian War, and of many of Murat’s\r\nNeapolitans also. So set had he been on expeditions to Calabria or\r\nTuscany, that he had made great difficulties when ordered to send out\r\nthe Alicante expedition to favour Wellington’s Salamanca campaign[320].\r\nThe news of the Russian disaster had filled Bentinck’s mind with new\r\nItalian schemes--the conditions were even more favourable than in\r\n1812. He was now dreaming of invading Italy with all the men he could\r\nmuster, and proposed on February 24th to the British War Minister that\r\nhe should be allowed to withdraw all or some of the Anglo-Sicilian\r\ntroops from Alicante. He had also seen Admiral Greig, and put in a\r\nclaim for the hypothetical 15,000 Russians who had caused Wellington so\r\nmuch trouble. Knowing how much importance the latter attached to the\r\nAlicante Army, as the real nucleus of resistance to Suchet in Eastern\r\nSpain, he had the grace to send copies of his February dispatch to\r\nFreneda.\r\n\r\nThis was a most irritating interruption to Wellington’s arrangements\r\nfor the next campaign: the Alicante force was a valuable piece in the\r\ngreat game which he was working out. To see it taken off the board\r\nwould disarrange all his plan. Accordingly he made the strongest\r\nprotest to Lord Bathurst against the Italian expedition being\r\npermitted. To make any head in Italy, he said, at least 30,000 or\r\n40,000 men would be needed. No doubt many Italians were discontented\r\nwith the Napoleonic régime, but they would not commit themselves to\r\nrebellion unless a very large force came to their help. If only a small\r\narmy were landed, they would show passive or even active loyalty to\r\ntheir existing government. They might prefer a British to a French or\r\nan Austrian domination in their peninsula, because it would be more\r\nliberal and less extortionate. But they would want everything found for\r\nthem--arms, equipment, a subsidy. Unless the Government were prepared\r\nto start a new war on a very large scale, to raise, clothe, and equip a\r\ngreat mass of Italian troops, and to persevere to the last in a venture\r\nas big as that in Spain, the plan would fail, and any landing force\r\nwould be compelled to re-embark with loss and disgrace[321].\r\n\r\nOn the whole Wellington’s protest proved successful: Lord William was\r\nforced to leave a large body of his Anglo-Sicilians in Spain, though\r\nhe withdrew 2,000 men from Alicante early in April, when it was most\r\nneedful that the Allied force on the East Coast should be strong.\r\nThe remainder, despite (as we shall see) of very bad handling by Sir\r\nJohn Murray, proved sufficient to keep Suchet employed. No Italian\r\nexpedition was permitted during the campaigning season of 1813, though\r\nLord William sent out a small foreign expeditionary force for a raid on\r\nTuscany, which much terrified the Grand Duchess Eliza[322]. Next year\r\nonly, when the whole Napoleonic system was crumbling, did he collect a\r\nheterogeneous army of doubtful value, invade Liguria, and capture Genoa\r\nfrom a skeleton enemy. But by that time the French were out of Spain,\r\nand Wellington’s plans could not be ruined by the distraction of troops\r\non such an escapade. In May 1813 the Italian expedition, if permitted,\r\nmight have wrecked the whole campaign of Vittoria, by leaving Suchet\r\nfree to join the main French army. How it would have fared may be\r\njudged from the fact that the Viceroy Eugène made head all through the\r\nautumn against 80,000 men of the Austrian Army of Italy.\r\n\r\nSo much may suffice to explain Wellington’s dealings during the winter\r\nand spring of 1813 with the British Cabinet. His advice, as we have\r\nseen, was always asked, and generally settled the problem in the way\r\nthat he desired. So much cannot be said for his dealings with the\r\nCommander-in-Chief at the Horse Guards: the Duke of York seems to have\r\nbeen the last person in Whitehall to recognize the commanding intellect\r\nof the great general. Though he always wrote with perfect courtesy, he\r\nevidently considered that his own views on the organization, personnel,\r\nand management of the British Army were far more important than those\r\nof the victor of Salamanca. The correspondence of Wellington with the\r\nDuke and his Military Secretary, Colonel Henry Torrens, occupies an\r\nenormous number of pages in the volumes of Dispatches and Supplementary\r\nDispatches. Torrens, an obliging man, seems to have tried to make\r\nhimself a buffer between the two contending wills, and Wellington was\r\nconscious of the fact that he was no enemy. The subjects of contention\r\nwere many.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important was patronage. Now that he had reached the\r\nfifth year of his command in the Peninsula, Wellington considered that\r\nhe had won the right to choose his own chief subordinates. But still\r\nhe could not get officers of tried incapacity removed from the front,\r\nnor prevent others, against whom he had a bad mark, from being sent out\r\nto him. When he asked for removals, he was told of ‘the difficulty of\r\nsetting aside general officers who have creditably risen to high rank’\r\non the mere ground that they have been proved incapable, and unfit for\r\ntheir situations. But it was far worse that when he had requested that\r\ncertain generals should not be sent out, they came to him nevertheless,\r\ndespite of his definite protest; and then, when he requested that\r\nthey might be removed, he was told that he would incur odium and\r\nresponsibility for their removal. ‘What a situation then is mine! It is\r\nimpossible to prevent incapable men from being sent to the army; and\r\nthen when I complain that they have been sent, I am to be responsible!\r\nSurely the “odium” ought not to attach to the person who officially\r\nrepresents that they are not capable of filling their situations’--but\r\n(the aposiopesis may be filled up) to the Horse Guards for sending them\r\nout. Yet Wellington’s pen did not add the words which are necessary to\r\ncomplete the sense.\r\n\r\nThe most tiresome case in 1812-13 was that of Colonel James Willoughby\r\nGordon, who had come out as Quartermaster-General in 1812, when\r\nWellington’s first and most trusted quarter-master, George Murray, was\r\nremoved (quite without his desire) to a post in Ireland. Gordon was\r\nsent by the Duke of York’s personal choice[323], without any previous\r\nconsultation with the Commander-in-Chief in Spain as to whether he\r\nwould be acceptable. The atrocity of this appointment was not only that\r\nGordon was incapable, but that he was a political intriguer, who was\r\nin close touch with the Whig Opposition at home, and before he went\r\nout had promised to send confidential letters on the campaign to Lord\r\nGrey. This he actually did: the malicious Creevey had a privileged\r\npeep at them, and found that ‘his accounts are of the most desponding\r\ncast. He considers our ultimate discomfiture as a question purely of\r\ntime, and that it may happen any day, however early: and that our\r\npecuniary resources are utterly exhausted. The skill of the French in\r\nrecovering from their difficulties is inexhaustible: Lord W. himself\r\nowns that the resurrection of Marmont’s broken troops after Salamanca\r\nwas an absolute miracle of war. In short, Gordon considers that Lord\r\nW. is in very considerable danger[324].’ The writer was holding the\r\nmost important post on Wellington’s staff, and using the information\r\nthat he obtained for the benefit of the Parliamentary Opposition; he\r\nshould have been court-martialled for the abuse of his position for\r\npersonal ends. Wellington at last detected his mischief-making, by\r\nthe appearance in the Whig papers of definite facts that could only\r\nhave been known to three people--Wellington himself, his secretary\r\nFitzroy Somerset, and the Quartermaster-General. ‘I showed him,’ writes\r\nWellington to Bathurst, ‘my dispatch to your Lordship of August 3, as\r\nthe shortest way of making him acquainted with the state of affairs....\r\nThe topics of this dispatch find their way into the _Morning\r\nChronicle_, distorted into arguments against the Government. I am quite\r\ncertain that the arguments in the _Morning Chronicle_ are drawn from a\r\nperusal of my dispatches, and that no one saw them here excepting the\r\nQuartermaster-General and Lord Fitzroy. Even your Lordship had not yet\r\nreceived this dispatch, when the topics it contained were used against\r\nthe Government in the newspapers.... For the future he shall not see\r\nwhat I write--it would be no great loss to the Army if he were recalled\r\nto England. I cypher part of this letter in the cypher you sent me to\r\nbe used for General Maitland[325].’\r\n\r\nIt was four months before this traitor was got rid of, though Lord\r\nBathurst had been shocked by the news, and corroborated it by his\r\nown observation: he had seen mischievous letters from Gordon to the\r\nHorse Guards, and if he wrote such stuff to the Duke it was easy\r\nto guess what he might write to Lord Grey or Whitbread. Certain of\r\nthe newspaper paragraphs _must_ have come ‘from some intelligent\r\nperson with you[326].’ The strange way in which the removal was\r\naccomplished was not by a demand for his degradation for misuse of his\r\noffice[327], but by a formal report to the Horse Guards that ‘Colonel\r\nGordon does not turn his mind to the duties to be performed by the\r\nQuartermaster-General of an Army such as this, actively employed in\r\nthe field: notwithstanding his zeal and acknowledged talent, he has\r\nnever performed them, and I do not believe he ever will or can perform\r\nthem. I give this opinion with regret, and I hope His Royal Highness\r\nwill believe that I have not formed it hastily of an officer respecting\r\nwhose talents I, equally with His Royal Highness, had entertained a\r\nfavourable opinion[328].’ Three weeks later the Military Secretary\r\nat the Horse Guards writes that Wellington shall have back his old\r\nQuartermaster-General George Murray--and Gordon is recalled[329]. But\r\nwhy had Gordon ever been sent? The Duke of York alone could say. The\r\nimpression which he had left as a soldier upon men at the front, who\r\nknew nothing of his political intrigues, was exceedingly poor[330].\r\n\r\nThis was the worst trick which was played on Wellington from the\r\nHorse Guards. Another was the refusal to relieve him of the gallant\r\nbut muddle-headed and disobedient William Stewart, who despite of\r\nhis awful error at Albuera was allowed to come out to the Peninsula\r\nagain in 1812, and committed other terrible blunders: it was he who\r\ngot the three divisions into a marshy deadlock on the retreat from\r\nSalamanca, by deliberate and wilful neglect of directions[331]. ‘With\r\nthe utmost zeal and good intentions he _cannot_ obey an order,’ wrote\r\nWellington on December 6, 1812--yet Stewart was still commanding the\r\nSecond Division in 1814[332]. In letters sent to the Horse Guards\r\nin December 1812 the Commander-in-Chief in Spain petitioned for the\r\ndeparture of five out of his seven cavalry generals--which seems a\r\nlarge clearance--and of ten infantry divisional and brigade commanders.\r\nAbout half of them were ultimately brought home, but several were\r\nleft with him for another campaign. He had also asked that he might\r\nhave no more generals who were new to the Peninsula inflicted upon\r\nhim, because their arrival blocked promotion for deserving colonels,\r\nto whom he was anxious to give brigades. ‘I hope I shall have no more\r\nnew Generals: they really do but little good, and they take the places\r\nof officers who would be of real use. And then they are all desirous\r\nof returning to England[333].’ The appeal was in vain--several raw\r\nmajor-generals were sent out for the spring campaign of 1813, and we\r\nhave letters of Wellington making apologies to Peninsula veterans, to\r\nwhom he had promised promotion, for the fact that the commands which\r\nhe had been intending for them had been filled up against his wishes\r\nby the nominees of the Horse Guards. Things went a little better after\r\nVittoria, when several undesired officers went home, and several\r\ndeferred promotions took place--the news of that victory had had its\r\neffect even in Whitehall.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to sympathize with Wellington’s judgement--though\r\nnot with his grievance--in another matter of high debate during this\r\nwinter. Like most men he disliked talking about his own coffin, i.\r\ne. making elaborate arrangements for what was to happen in the event\r\nof his becoming a casualty, like Sir John Moore. He loathed the idea\r\nof ‘seconds in command’, arguing that they were either useless or\r\ntiresome. He did not want an officer at his elbow who would have a sort\r\nof right to be consulted, as in the bad old days of ‘councils of war’;\r\nnor did he wish to have to find a separate command for such a person\r\nto keep him employed[334]. It was true that he often trusted Hill\r\nwith an independent corps in Estremadura; but frequently he called in\r\nHill’s column and it became part of the main army--as on the Caya in\r\n1811, in the Salamanca retreat in 1812, and at Vittoria in 1813. In the\r\nwinter of 1812-13 a point which might have been of high importance was\r\nraised: who would be his successor in case of a regrettable accident?\r\nWellington decided that Beresford was the proper choice--despite of\r\nAlbuera. ‘All that I can tell you is that the ablest man I have yet\r\nseen with the army, and the one having the largest views, is Beresford.\r\nThey tell me that, when I am not present, he wants decision: and he\r\ncertainly embarrassed me a little with his doubts when he commanded in\r\nEstremadura: but I am quite certain that he is the only person capable\r\nof conducting a large concern[335].’ He also held that Beresford’s\r\nposition as a marshal in the Portuguese Army gave him a seniority in\r\nthe Allied Army over British lieutenant-generals.\r\n\r\nThis judgement of Wellington’s is surprising: Beresford was courageous,\r\na good organizer, a terror to shirkers and jobbers, and accustomed\r\nto command. Yet one would have thought that his record of 1811, when\r\nhe displayed almost every possible fault alike of strategy and of\r\nmorale in Estremadura, would have ruled him out. Wellington thought,\r\nas it would appear, that he had a better conception of the war as a\r\nwhole--‘the large concern’--than any of the other generals in the\r\nPeninsula, and had every opportunity of knowing. On this most critical\r\npoint Wellington and the Duke of York fell out at once: it was not that\r\nthe Duke wanted to rule out Beresford because he was undecided in the\r\nfield, unpopular with his colleagues, self-assertive or arrogant. He\r\nhad a simple Horse Guards rule which in his view excluded Beresford\r\nfrom consideration at once. ‘According to the general received opinion\r\nof the Service no officer in the British Army above the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel is ever expected to serve under an officer junior to\r\nhimself, even though he may possess a superior local commission.’ He\r\nthen proceeded to recall the fact that in 1794, when Lord Moira came\r\nto Flanders with the local rank of general, Sir Ralph Abercrombie, and\r\na number of other general officers with commissions of senior date,\r\nrefused to serve under him: in consequence of which Lord Moira had to\r\nresign and to return to England. There were many similar examples\r\nin the past. The right of officers to refuse to serve under a junior\r\nbeing established, it could not be argued that higher rank acquired\r\nby that junior in a foreign service had any weight. Beresford might\r\nbe a Portuguese field-marshal, but from the British point of view he\r\nwas junior to Sir Thomas Graham, Sir Stapleton Cotton, and Sir Rowland\r\nHill. If by some deplorable accident Lord Wellington were incapacitated\r\nfrom command at the present moment, Sir Thomas Graham, if with the\r\nArmy, would succeed. If Sir Thomas were on sick leave, Sir Stapleton\r\nCotton would be the senior officer in the Peninsula, and the command of\r\nthe Army would automatically devolve on him: if Sir Stapleton were also\r\non leave, it would go to General Hill.\r\n\r\n‘It appears impossible to expect that British generals senior to\r\nMarshal Beresford will submit to serve under him. It appears to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, therefore, that there remains but one of two\r\nalternatives--the one to recall Marshal Beresford from the Peninsula in\r\ncase he should persist in his claim; the other, in case Lord Wellington\r\nstill prefers that officer as his second in command, to recall all the\r\nBritish lieutenant-generals senior to him in our own Army[336].’\r\n\r\nThis was a maddening reply, for though Wellington liked Stapleton\r\nCotton he had no delusions about his intellectual capacity. The best\r\nhe could say about him during the controversy was that ‘he commands\r\nour cavalry very well; I am certain much better than many who might\r\nbe sent out to us, and who might be supposed much cleverer than he\r\nis.’ As a matter of fact, Graham was on sick leave, with an affliction\r\nof eyesight, which was supposed to be likely to result in permanent\r\nincapacity. Cotton was also on short leave to England on ‘urgent\r\npersonal affairs[337],’ but expected back shortly. Therefore the Duke’s\r\nletter was a proposal to consign the fate of the British Army in the\r\nPeninsula to a gallant officer with the mental capacity of a cavalry\r\nbrigadier, who had never commanded a force of all arms, and who was the\r\ncause of much quiet amusement to his comrades, from his ostentatious\r\ndress and unconcealed admiration for his own perfections.\r\n\r\nLord Bathurst tried to smooth matters, by asking Graham whether he\r\nfelt inclined to surrender any claim to take over the Peninsular\r\nArmy on account of his bad health. Sir Thomas replied that he should\r\ndecline the responsibility for that reason: that he hoped to cause no\r\ndifficulties, but that he could not agree that Beresford had any claim,\r\n‘his obligation to the service bound him not to sacrifice the rights of\r\nBritish officers from a purely personal spirit of accommodation.’ To\r\nwhich Bathurst replied that if he waived his rights as a consequence\r\nof his ill health, while making no concession on grounds of principle,\r\nperhaps Hill and Cotton might do the same. To this the victor of\r\nBarrosa answered that he might consent, on the distinct understanding\r\nthat no precedent was created, and that the arrangement was\r\ntemporary[338].\r\n\r\nHis compliance proved useful: Stapleton Cotton arrived in London\r\nshortly after and ‘expressed himself decidedly against Sir William\r\nBeresford’s claims, and with some warmth.’ Lord Bathurst explained to\r\nhim that Graham’s consent to the ‘temporary arrangement’ must govern\r\nhis own, and tried to put him off the idea that he himself would\r\nundoubtedly become Wellington’s destined successor, if Graham refused\r\nthe post, by hinting that after all Graham might recover his eyesight,\r\nand be able to take over the command. After showing much soreness,\r\nCotton reluctantly acquiesced. The War Minister, writing an account of\r\nthe interview to Wellington, ends with ‘I think it necessary to have\r\nthis explained beforehand, that you might not have any doubt whether\r\nyou were, after what has passed, to consider Sir Thomas Graham or Sir\r\nStapleton Cotton as the person who was to exercise the command in case\r\nof your personal indisposition[339].’ So Beresford’s nomination was\r\npassed, as Wellington desired, and contrary to the Duke of York’s views\r\nas to the inevitable power of old precedent. But it was only passed by\r\nthe consent of the other parties concerned, however reluctantly given.\r\nFortunately Wellington preserved his usual splendid health, and the\r\nexperiment of trusting the whole Allied Army in the Peninsula to the\r\nvictor of Albuera was never made.\r\n\r\nOn another great controversy which (since Wellington never went off\r\nduty for a day) was of more practical importance than that of the right\r\nof succession, the Duke of York was partly successful in discomfiting\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief in Spain. This was a question on which there had\r\nbeen much argument at the end of each Peninsular campaign, but never\r\nso much as in 1812-13. The exceptionally heavy casualty lists of the\r\nstorming of Badajoz, the battle of Salamanca, and the retreat from\r\nBurgos had brought a great number of units, both cavalry and infantry,\r\nto very low figures. There were (as has been mentioned in a previous\r\nchapter) twelve battalions which had at the end of the retreat less\r\nthan 300 bayonets effective, thirteen which had more sick than men\r\npresent with the colours. For some of these the difficulty was only\r\na momentary one--there was a large draft on the way to reinforce the\r\nunit, or at least a good number of trained recruits in Great Britain\r\nready to be sent out. But this was not the case with all of them: the\r\nreason of this was to be sought in the organization of the Army in\r\n1812: the majority of infantry regiments had two battalions; if the\r\nsecond unit was on home service, it regularly found drafts for the\r\none at the front. But if the regiment was a single-battalion corps\r\n(and there were seven such with Wellington[340]), or if it chanced to\r\nhave both units abroad and none at home (as was the case with fifteen\r\nother corps[341]), there was only a dépôt in Great Britain, and this\r\nhad to feed two battalions both on active service overseas, and often\r\ncould not discharge the double task effectively. There were of course\r\nregiments so popular, or recruited with such zeal and efficiency, that\r\nthey succeeded in keeping two units abroad with adequate numbers: but\r\nthis was exceptional.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done if a Peninsular battalion had got very low in\r\nnumbers, had no sister-unit at home to feed it, and had few or no\r\nrecruits at its British dépôt ready to be sent out? This was the case\r\nin December 1812 with twelve good old battalions of the Peninsular\r\nArmy[342]. The Duke of York maintained that since they all showed under\r\n350 effectives present (one was as low as 149 rank and file), and\r\nsince there was no immediate prospect of working them up to even a low\r\nbattalion strength of 450 or 500 men, they must come home at once, and\r\ntake a long turn of British service, in which they could be brought up\r\ngradually to their proper establishment. He had carried out this plan\r\nin earlier years with some very fine but wasted battalions, such as the\r\n29th and 97th. To replace the depleted veteran corps, there should come\r\nout new battalions from home, recently brought up to full strength. The\r\nsame ought to be done with four or five cavalry regiments, which could\r\nshow only about 250 horses effective.\r\n\r\nBut Wellington had other views, and had begun to carry them out on his\r\nown responsibility. He held that a well-tried battalion acclimatized\r\nto Peninsular service was such a precious thing, and a raw battalion\r\nsuch a comparatively worthless one, that it would be best to combine\r\nthe wasted units in pairs as ‘Provisional Battalions’ of 600 or 700\r\nbayonets, each sending home the cadres of four or five companies to\r\nits dépôt, and keeping six or five at the front. The returning cadres\r\nwould work up to full strength by degrees, and could then come out\r\nagain to join the service companies. On December 6th, 1812, he issued\r\norders to constitute three Provisional Battalions[343]: he intended to\r\ncarry out the same system for several more pairs of battalions[344],\r\nand it was put into practice for the 2/31st and 2/66th as from December\r\n20. So with the cavalry, he intended to reduce four regiments to a\r\ntwo-squadron establishment, sending home the cadres of their other\r\nsquadrons to be filled up at leisure.\r\n\r\nOn January 13th the Duke of York sent out a memorandum entirely\r\ndisapproving of the system. He regretted to differ in principle from\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief in Spain, but could not possibly concur in the\r\narrangement. All depleted battalions for which no drafts could be\r\nfound must come home at once. ‘Experience has shown that a skeleton\r\nbattalion composed of officers, non-commissioned officers, and a\r\ncertain foundation of old and experienced soldiers can be re-formed\r\nfor any service in a short time: but if a corps reduced in numbers be\r\nbroken up by the division of its establishment, such an interruption\r\nis occasioned in its interior economy and _esprit de corps_, that\r\nits speedy recompletion and reorganization for foreign service is\r\neffectually prevented. The experiment now suggested has once been\r\ntried, and has resulted in a degree of irregularity, contention, and\r\nindiscipline in the regiment concerned, which had made necessary the\r\nstrongest measures.’ (Many court martials, and the removal of the\r\nwhole of the officers into other battalions.) It was justly urged that\r\nseasoned men are more valuable than men fresh from England, but for\r\nthe sake of a present and comparatively trifling advantage the general\r\nefficiency of the whole British Army must not be impaired. All the\r\ndepleted battalions should be sent home at once[345].\r\n\r\nWellington was deeply vexed at this decision. He replied that orders,\r\nif definitely given, would of course be obeyed; but if left to act on\r\nhis own responsibility, he could only say that the service in America\r\nor Sicily or at home was not his concern, and that he was bound to\r\nstate what was best for the Peninsular Army. One old soldier who has\r\nserved two years in Spain was more effective than two, or even three,\r\nwho had not. Raw battalions fill the hospitals, straggle, maraud, and\r\nstarve. He never would part with the Provisional Battalions as long as\r\nit was left to his discretion: and the same with cavalry. He had four\r\ndepleted cavalry regiments much under-horsed: he would like to have\r\nthe horses of the four hussar regiments which were being sent to him\r\nfrom England to give to his old Peninsula troopers, rather than the\r\nregiments themselves. But orders are orders and must be obeyed[346].\r\n\r\nThe Duke replied that for his part he had to take into consideration\r\nnot only the Peninsula but the British service all over the world.\r\nDrafting of one corps into another was hurtful to the service and\r\ndepressed the spirits of corps: it was even deemed illegal. Though\r\nthe last person in the world to wish to diminish the Army in Spain or\r\ncripple its general’s exertions, he was compelled to persevere in his\r\ndirection from necessity[347].\r\n\r\nOn March 13th Wellington reluctantly carried out the orders from\r\nthe Horse Guards as regards his depleted cavalry regiments: the 4th\r\nDragoon Guards, 9th and 11th Light Dragoons, and 2nd Hussars of the\r\nGerman Legion were ordered to make over their effective horses to\r\nother regiments, and to prepare to embark at Lisbon. A paragraph in\r\nthe General Orders expressed Wellington’s regret at losing any of his\r\nbrave old troops, and his hope that he might yet see them again at the\r\nfront[348].\r\n\r\nAs to the infantry, the Duke repeating his general precept that\r\ndepleted battalions must come home, but not giving definite orders for\r\nthem by name and number, a curious compromise took place. Wellington\r\nsent back to England the two weakest units, which were still in April\r\nwell under 300 bayonets apiece[349]: he had already drafted a third\r\ninto the senior battalion of its own regiment, which was also in the\r\nPeninsula. Four more of the war-worn battalions had been worked up to\r\nabout 400 of all ranks, by the return of convalescents and the arrival\r\nof small drafts--Wellington ventured to keep them, and to report them\r\nas efficient battalions, if small ones[350]. The challenge to Home\r\nauthority lay with the remaining six[351]: though five of them were\r\nwell under 400 strong he nevertheless stuck to his original plan and\r\nformed three provisional battalions out of them. If the Duke of York\r\nwanted them, he must ask for them by name: he did not, and they kept\r\nthe field till the end of the war, and were repeatedly mentioned by\r\nWellington as among the most efficient units that he owned. Presumably\r\nVittoria put his arrangements beyond criticism--at any rate, the\r\ncontroversy was dropped at the Duke’s end. The net result was that\r\nWellington lost three depleted infantry units and four depleted\r\ncavalry units of the old stock--about 2,000 veteran sabres and\r\nbayonets. In return he received before or during the campaign of 1813\r\nfour new cavalry regiments--all hussars[352]--and six new infantry\r\nbattalions[353] all much stronger than the units they replaced, and\r\nmaking up about 1,600 sabres and 3,000 bayonets. He would probably have\r\nsaid that his real strength was not appreciably changed by getting\r\n4,500 new hands instead of 2,000 old ones. Certainly, considering\r\nthe effort that was required from the Peninsula Army in 1813, it is\r\nsufficiently surprising that its strength was, on balance, only four\r\ninfantry units to the good--the cavalry regiments remaining the same in\r\nnumber as in 1812.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of small administrative problems to be settled during\r\nthe winter-rest of 1812-13, which worried Wellington but need not\r\nworry the modern student of history, being in themselves trivial. It\r\nis well, however, to note that in the spring of 1813 his old complaint\r\nabout the impossibility of extracting hard cash from the Government,\r\ninstead of the bank-notes and bills which the Spanish and Portuguese\r\npeasantry refused to regard as real money, came practically to an\r\nend. By heroic exertions the Chancellor of the Exchequer was scraping\r\ntogether gold enough to send £100,000 a month to Lisbon. A large sum\r\nin pagodas had been brought all the way from Madras, and the Mint was\r\nbusy all the year in melting them down and recoining them as guineas.\r\nIt was the first time since the ‘Suspension of Cash Payments Act’ of\r\n1797 that any gold of this size had been struck and issued. As the\r\nwhole output went straight to the Peninsula for the Army, the new coin\r\nwas generally known as the ‘military guinea.’ Considering that gold was\r\nso much sought for in England at the time that a guinea could command\r\n27_s._ in paper, it was no small feat to procure the Indian gold, and\r\nto see that the much wanted commodity went abroad without diminution.\r\nWellington could have done with much more gold--six times as much he\r\nonce observed--but at least he was no longer in the state of absolute\r\nbankruptcy in which he had opened the campaign of the preceding\r\nyear--nor obliged to depend for a few thousand dollars on profits to\r\nbe made on Egyptian corn which he sold in Lisbon, or impositions of\r\ndoubtful legality made upon speculators in Commissariat Bonds. The\r\nPortuguese troops had their pay still in arrears--but that was not\r\nWellington’s responsibility. The muleteers of the transport train\r\nwere suffering from being paid in _vales_, which they sold to Lisbon\r\nsharks, rather than in the _cruzados novos_ or Pillar Dollars which\r\nthey craved, and sometimes deserted in not unnatural disgust. But, at\r\nthe worst, it could not be denied that finance looked a good deal more\r\npromising than it had in 1812[354].\r\n\r\nThere had been much reorganization since the end of the Burgos retreat.\r\nIn uniforms especially the change was greater than in any other year of\r\nthe war: this was the first campaign in which the British heavy cavalry\r\nshowed the new brass helmet, discarding the antiquated cocked hat--the\r\nlight dragoons had gone into shakos, relinquishing the black japanned\r\nleather helmet with bearskin crest. Infantry officers for the first\r\ntime appeared in shakos resembling those of the rank and file--the\r\nunwise custom by which they had up till now worn cocked hats, which\r\nmade them easy marks for the enemy’s snipers, being at last officially\r\ncondemned. Another much needed improvement was the substitution of\r\nsmall tin camp kettles, to be carried by the men, for the large iron\r\nFlanders cooking-pots, four to each company and carried on mules, which\r\nhad hitherto been employed. They had always been a nuisance; partly\r\nbecause the mules could never be relied upon to keep up with the unit,\r\npartly because their capacity was so large that it took much firewood\r\nand a long space of time to cook their contents. Nothing is more common\r\nin personal diaries of 1808-12 than complaints about rations that had\r\nto be eaten half-cooked, or were not eaten at all, because the order to\r\nmove on arrived before the cauldrons had even begun to get warm.\r\n\r\nA more doubtful expedient was that of putting the great-coats of the\r\nwhole of the infantry into store before the march began. Wellington\r\nopined that the weight of coat and blanket combined was more than the\r\nsoldier could be expected to carry. One or other must be abandoned,\r\nand after much consideration it was concluded that the blanket was more\r\nessential. ‘Soldiers while in exercise during the day seldom wear their\r\ngreat-coats, which are worn by them only at night, together with the\r\nblanket: but as the Commander of the forces has now caused the army to\r\nbe provided with tents, the necessity for the great-coat for night use\r\nis superseded[355].’ And tents, as a matter of fact, were provided for\r\nthe first time during this campaign. The expedient worked well enough\r\nduring the summer and autumn, when the weather was usually fine, in\r\nspite of some spells of rainy weather in June. But in the Pyrenees,\r\nfrom October onward, the tents proved inadequate protection both from\r\nsudden hurricanes and from continuous snowfall. And bad though the\r\nplight of men huddled in tents frozen stiff by the north wind might be,\r\nit was nothing to that of the sentry on some mountain defile, trying\r\nto keep a blanket round his shoulders in December blizzards. Yet the\r\ntents, with all their defects, were a decided boon--it would have been\r\nimpossible indeed to hold the Pyrenean passes at all, if some shelter\r\nhad not been provided for the battalions of the front line. Villages\r\navailable for billeting were few and always in the hollows to the\r\nrear, not on the crests where the line of defence lay. It would seem\r\nthat the experiment of dispensing with the great-coats was dropped,\r\nand that they were brought round by sea to Pasages or St. Sebastian,\r\nfor personal diaries mention them as in use again, in at least some\r\nregiments, by December. Oddly enough, there appears to be no official\r\nrecord of the revocation of the order given in May.\r\n\r\nAnother innovation of the period was the introduction of a new unit\r\ninto the British Army--called (after the idiotic system of nomenclature\r\nused at the Horse Guards) the ‘Staff Corps Cavalry.’ They were really\r\nmilitary mounted police, picked from the best and steadiest men in\r\nthe cavalry regiments, and placed under the command of Major Scovell,\r\nthe cypher-secretary on Wellington’s head-quarters staff, of whose\r\nactivities much has been said in the last volume. There were two troops\r\nof them, soon raised to four, with a total strength of about 300 of all\r\nranks[356]. The object of the creation of the corps was to make more\r\neffectual the restraint on marauding, and other crimes with which the\r\nProvost-Marshal and his assistants were too few to deal. Wellington had\r\nrailed with almost exaggerated emphasis on the straggling, disorder,\r\nand looting which had distinguished the Burgos retreat, and the Duke\r\nof York had licensed the formation of this police-cavalry as the best\r\nremedy for the disease. They had plenty to do after Vittoria, when\r\nthe British Army had the greatest orgy of plunder that ever fell to\r\nits lot during the war. Wellington’s own view was that the slackness\r\nof discipline in certain regiments, rather than privations or casual\r\nopportunity, was the main source of all evil. But he welcomed any\r\nmachinery that would deal with the symptoms of indiscipline, even\r\nif it did not strike at the roots of the disease. Over-leniency by\r\ncourts martial was another cause of misconduct according to his\r\ntheory--with this he strove to cope by getting from home a civilian\r\nJudge-Advocate-General, whose task was to revise the proceedings of\r\nsuch bodies, and disallow illegal proceedings and decisions. The\r\nfirst and only holder of this office, Francis Larpent, has left an\r\ninteresting and not always discreet account of his busy life at\r\nHead-Quarters, which included a strange episode of captivity in the\r\nFrench lines on the Bidassoa[357].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PERPLEXITIES OF KING JOSEPH. FEBRUARY-MARCH 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen, when dealing with the last month of 1812 and the\r\ndistribution of the French army into winter quarters, that all the\r\narrangements made by King Joseph, Jourdan, and Soult were settled\r\nbefore any knowledge of the meaning of the Moscow Retreat had come to\r\nhand. The famous ‘29th Bulletin’ did not reach Madrid till January\r\n6th, 1813; this was a long delay: but the Emperor’s return to Paris on\r\nDecember 16th, though he arrived at the Tuileries only thirty-six hours\r\nafter the Bulletin had come to hand, was not known to Joseph or Jourdan\r\ntill February 14th--which was a vastly longer delay. The road had been\r\nblocked between Vittoria and Burgos for over five weeks--and couriers\r\nand dispatches were accumulating at both these places--one set unable\r\nto get south, the other to get north. The Minister of War at Paris\r\nreceived Joseph’s dispatches of the 9th, 20th, and 24th of December all\r\nin one delivery on January 29th[358]. The King, still more unlucky,\r\ngot the Paris dispatches of all the dates between December 18th and\r\nJanuary 4th on February 14th to 16th by several couriers who came\r\nthrough almost simultaneously[359]. It was not till Palombini’s Italian\r\ndivision--in a series of fights lasting from January 25 to February\r\n13--had cleared away Longa and Mendizabal from the high-road between\r\nBurgos and Vittoria, that quicker communication between those cities\r\nbecame possible.\r\n\r\nLong as it had taken in 1812 to get a letter from Paris to Madrid,\r\nthere had never been such a monstrous gap in correspondence as that\r\nwhich took place in January 1813. Hence came the strange fact that\r\nwhen Napoleon had returned to France, and started on his old system\r\nof giving strategical orders for the Army of Spain once more, these\r\norders[360]--one on top of another--accumulated at Vittoria, and came\r\nin one overwhelming mass, to upset all the plans which Joseph and\r\nJourdan had been carrying out since the New Year.\r\n\r\nThe King had received the 29th Bulletin on January 6th: he had gathered\r\nfrom it that matters were going badly with the army in Russia, but had\r\nno conception of the absolute ruin that had befallen his brother’s\r\nhost. Hence he had kept his troops spread in the wide cantonments\r\ntaken in December, and had sent Daricau’s to the province of Cuenca,\r\nto reopen the way to Suchet at Valencia. The great convoy of Spanish\r\nand French administrators, courtiers, and refugees, which had been left\r\nin Suchet’s care, retraced its way to Madrid under escort of some of\r\nDaricau’s troops in the last days of January. Meanwhile Pierre Soult’s\r\ncavalry continued to sweep La Mancha, imposing contributions and\r\nshooting guerrilleros, and the Army of the Centre cleared the greater\r\npart of the country east and north of Madrid of strong parties of the\r\nMedico’s and the Empecinado’s men. Caffarelli, as Jourdan complained,\r\nought to have been making more head in the North--but his dispatches\r\nwere so infrequent that his position could not be fully judged--it was\r\nonly certain that he could not keep the Burgos-Bayonne road open for\r\ncouriers.\r\n\r\nThere was only one touch during the winter with Wellington’s army,\r\nwhose cantonments, save those of the Light Division, were far back,\r\nbehind the ‘no man’s land’ which encircled the French armies. This\r\nsingle contact was due to an adventurous reconnaissance by Foy, who\r\nat his head-quarters at Avila had conceived a project for surprising\r\nHill’s most outlying detachment, the 50th regiment, which was billeted\r\nat Bejar, in the passes in front of Coria. On false news that no good\r\nlook-out was being kept around Bejar, he started on the 19th February\r\nfrom Piedrahita with a column of three very weak infantry battalions\r\nand 80 horse--about 1,500 men in all, and marching day and night fell\r\nupon the cantonments of the 50th at dawn on the morning of the 20th.\r\nThe surprise did not come off. Colonel Harrison of the 50th was a\r\ncautious officer, who had barricaded the ruined gates of the town,\r\nand patched its crumbling walls--He had picquets far out, and was\r\naccustomed to keep several companies under arms from 2 o’clock till\r\ndaylight every night. Moreover Hill, thinking the position exposed,\r\nhad lately reinforced him with the 6th Caçadores, from Ashworth’s\r\nbrigade. Foy, charging in on the town in the dusk, dislodged the\r\noutlying picquets after a sharp skirmish; but his advanced guard of 300\r\nvoltigeurs met such a storm of fire from the gate and walls, which were\r\nfully manned, that it swerved off when 30 yards from the entrance. Foy\r\nordered a general retreat, since he saw the enemy ready for him, and\r\nmarched off as quickly as he had come, pursued for some distance by the\r\nCaçadores[361]. He says in his dispatch to Reille that he only lost two\r\nmen killed and five wounded, that he could have carried the town had he\r\npleased, and that he only retired because he was warned that the 71st\r\nand 92nd, the other regiments of Cadogan’s brigade, were marching up\r\nfrom Baños, seven miles away[362]. This those may believe who please:\r\nit is certain that he made off the moment that he saw that his surprise\r\nhad failed, and that he was committed to an attack on a barricaded\r\ntown. Hill expected more raids of this sort, but the attempt was never\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 14th of February, five days before Foy’s adventure,\r\nthat King Joseph received his first Paris mail. Its portentous and\r\nappalling contents were far worse than anything that he had expected.\r\nThe most illuminating item was a letter from Colonel Desprez, his\r\naide-de-camp, who had made the Moscow retreat, and was able to give\r\nhim the whole truth concerning Russia. ‘We lost prisoners by the tens\r\nof thousands--but, however many the prisoners, the dead are many more.\r\nEvery nightly bivouac left hundreds of frozen corpses behind. The\r\nsituation may be summed up by saying that the army is _dead_. The Young\r\nGuard, to which I was attached, quitted Moscow 8,000 strong; there\r\nwere 400 left at Wilna. All the other corps have suffered on the same\r\nscale; I am convinced that not 20,000 men recrossed the Vistula. If\r\nyour Majesty asks me where the retreat will stop, I can only reply that\r\nthe Russians will settle that point. I cannot think that the Prussians\r\nwill resist: the King and his ministers are favourably disposed--not\r\nso the people--riots are breaking out in Berlin: crossing Prussia I\r\nhad evidence that we can hardly count on these allies. And it seems\r\nthat in the Austrian army the officers are making public demonstrations\r\nagainst continuing the war. This is a sad picture--but I think there is\r\nno exaggeration in it. On returning to Paris and thinking all over in\r\ncold blood, my judgement on the situation is as gloomy as it was at the\r\ntheatre of war[363].’\r\n\r\nNapoleon had spent several days at the Tuileries, busy with grandiose\r\nschemes for the organization of a new _Grande Armée_, to replace that\r\nwhich he had sacrificed in Russia, and with financial and diplomatic\r\nproblems of absorbing interest, before he found a moment in which to\r\ndictate to Clarke his orders for the King of Spain. The note was very\r\nshort and full of reticences[364]: it left much unsaid that had to be\r\nsupplied by the recipient’s intelligence. ‘The King must have received\r\nby now the 29th Bulletin, which would show him the state of affairs in\r\nthe North; they were absorbing the Emperor’s care and attention. Things\r\nbeing as they were, he ought to move his head-quarters to Valladolid,\r\nholding Madrid only as the extreme point of occupation of his southern\r\nwing. He should turn his attention to the pacification of Biscay and\r\nNavarre while the English were inactive. Soult had been sent orders to\r\ncome back to France--as the King had repeatedly requested; his Army\r\nof the South might be given over to Marshal Jourdan or to Gazan.’ If\r\nJoseph had owned no independent sources of information such a statement\r\nwould have left him much in the dark, both as to the actual state of\r\nthe Emperor’s resources, and as to his intentions with regard to Spain.\r\nThe Emperor did not say that he had lost his army and must create\r\nanother, nor did he intimate how far he intended to give up his Spanish\r\nventure. But the order to draw back to Valladolid and hold Madrid\r\nlightly, could only be interpreted as a warning that there would be no\r\nmore reinforcements available for Spain, so that the area of occupation\r\nwould have to be contracted.\r\n\r\nThe recall of Soult was what Joseph had eagerly petitioned for in 1812,\r\nwhen he had come upon the curious letter in which the Marshal accused\r\nhim before the Emperor of treason to the French cause[365]. But the\r\nMarshal was not brought home in disgrace; rather he was sent for in the\r\nhour of danger, as one who could be useful to the new _Grande Armée_.\r\nIt must have been irritating to the King to know, from a passage in the\r\nalready-cited letter of Colonel Desprez, that Napoleon had called the\r\nDuke of Dalmatia ‘the only military brain in the Peninsula’, that he\r\nstigmatized the King’s denunciations of him as _des pauvretés_ to which\r\nhe attached no importance, and that he had added that half the generals\r\nin Spain had shared Soult’s suspicions. The Marshal left, in triumph\r\nrather than in disgrace, with a large staff and escort, and a long\r\ntrain of _fourgons_ carrying his Andalusian plunder, more especially\r\nhis splendid gallery of Murillos robbed from Seville churches[366].\r\n\r\nDated one day later than the Emperor’s first rough notes, we find\r\nthe formal dispatch from the war-minister Clarke, which made things\r\na little clearer. Setting forth his master’s ideas in a more verbose\r\nstyle, Clarke explained that the affairs of Spain must be subordinated\r\nto those of the North. The move to Valladolid would make communication\r\nwith Paris shorter and safer, and provide a larger force to hold down\r\nNorthern Spain. Caffarelli was not strong enough both to hunt down the\r\nguerrilleros and at the same time to provide garrisons on the great\r\nroads and the coast. The King would have to lend him a hand in the task.\r\n\r\nThere were other dispatches for Joseph and Jourdan dated on the 4th\r\nof January, but only one more of importance: this was an order for\r\nwholesale drafts to be made from the Army of Spain, for the benefit\r\nof the new Army of Germany. But large as they were, the limited\r\nscale of them showed that the Emperor had not the least intention of\r\nsurrendering his hold on the Peninsula, or of drawing back to the line\r\nof the Ebro or the Pyrenees, as Lord Liverpool had expected[367]. All\r\nthe six Armies of Spain--those of the North, Portugal, the Centre, the\r\nSouth, Aragon, and Catalonia--were to continue in existence, and the\r\ntotal number of men to be drawn from any one of them did not amount to\r\na fourth of its numbers. There were still to be 200,000 men left in the\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nThe first demand was for twenty-five picked men from each battalion\r\nof infantry or regiment of cavalry, and ten from each battery of\r\nartillery, to reconstitute the Imperial Guard, reduced practically\r\nto nothing in Russia. Putting aside foreign regiments (Italian,\r\nNeapolitan, German, Swiss) there were some 220 French battalions in\r\nSpain in January 1813, and some 35 regiments of cavalry. The call was\r\ntherefore for 5,500 bayonets and 875 sabres--no great amount from an\r\narmy which had 260,000 men on its rolls, and 212,000 actually under the\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nBut this was only a commencement. It was more important that the Armies\r\nof the South and Catalonia were to contribute a large number of cadres\r\nto the new _Grande Armée_. Those of Portugal, Aragon, the Centre, and\r\nthe North were at first less in question, because their regiments were,\r\non the average, not so strong as those of the other two. The Army of\r\nthe South was specially affected, because its units were (and always\r\nhad been) very large regiments. In 1812 Soult’s infantry corps nearly\r\nall had three battalions--a few four. Similarly with the cavalry,\r\nmany regiments had four squadrons, none less than three. The edict of\r\nJanuary 4th ordered that each infantry regiment should send back to\r\nFrance the full cadre of officers and non-commissioned officers for one\r\nbattalion, with a skeleton cadre of men, cutting down the number of\r\nbattalions present with the eagle by one, and drafting the surplus rank\r\nand file of the subtracted battalion into those remaining in Spain. The\r\ncadre was roughly calculated out to 120 of all ranks. When, therefore,\r\nthe system was applied to the Army of the South, it was cut down from\r\n57 battalions to 36 in its 19 regiments[368]. The 21 cadres took off to\r\nFrance 2,500 officers and men. Similarly 15 cavalry regiments, in 50\r\nsquadrons, were to send 12 squadron-cadres to France, some 600 sabres.\r\n\r\nThe small Army of Catalonia was to contribute a battalion-cadre\r\nfrom each of those of its regiments which had three or more\r\nbattalions--which would give six more cadres for Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Armies of Portugal, Aragon, and the Centre were mainly composed\r\nof regiments having only two battalions--they were therefore for the\r\npresent left comparatively untouched. The first named was only ordered\r\nto give up one battalion-cadre, the second two, the third three (all\r\nfrom Palombini’s Italian division). Of cavalry the Army of Portugal\r\nonly gave up one squadron-cadre, the Army of the Centre three.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the small number of foreign auxiliary troops still left\r\nin Spain were ordered back to France, save the remnant of Palombini’s\r\nand Severoli’s Italians and the Rheinbund units[369] in the Army of\r\nthe Centre, viz. the 7th Polish Lancers (the last regiment of troops\r\nof this nationality left south of the Pyrenees), the Westphalian horse\r\nin the Army of the Centre, and the Berg and Westphalian infantry in\r\nCatalonia. Moreover, the brigade of the Young Guard in the Army of the\r\nNorth (that of Dumoustier) and the three naval battalions from Cadiz,\r\nwhich had served so long in the Army of the South, were to come home,\r\nalso four batteries of French horse-artillery and two of Westphalian\r\nfield artillery. Lastly, cadres being as necessary for the military\r\ntrain as for any other branch of the service, all the armies were\r\nto send home every dismounted man of this corps. The same rule was\r\napplied to the _Équipages militaires_ and the Artillery Park. This\r\nwhole deduction from the Army of Spain under these heads came to nearly\r\n12,000 soldiers of all arms, over and above these cadres.\r\n\r\nThere was an elaborate clause as to reorganizing the Army of the\r\nNorth: in return for giving up four provisional regiments of drafts to\r\nthe Armies of Portugal and the South, it was to get three regiments\r\nmade over to it from the former, and one from the latter. Napoleon\r\ncalculated that it would lose nothing in numbers from the exchange,\r\nbut as a matter of fact it did. The drafts to be returned to their\r\nproper corps ran to over 8,000 men. But General Reille, being told to\r\ncontribute three regiments to the Army of the North, selected the three\r\ndepleted units which had composed Thomières’ unlucky division at the\r\nbattle of Salamanca (the 1st, 62nd, and 101st), which together did\r\nnot make up 3,000 bayonets[370], though Gazan chose to make over the\r\n64th, a three-battalion regiment with 1,600 men. The Army of the North,\r\ntherefore, lost nearly 3,000 men on the balance of the exchange, though\r\nthe Emperor was aware that it was already too weak for the task set it.\r\nBut he probably considered that Palombini’s Italians, detached (as we\r\nhave already seen[371]) from the Army of the Centre, would make up the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the squadron-cadres which he requisitioned on January\r\n4th, the Emperor had a further intention of bringing back to Central\r\nEurope some complete units of heavy cavalry, to furnish the host now\r\ncollecting in Germany with the horsemen in which it was so notoriously\r\ndeficient. The whole of the dragoon-division of Boyer in the Army of\r\nPortugal is marked in the March returns with _ordre de rentrer en\r\nFrance_; so are several dragoon regiments in the Army of the South. But\r\nas a matter of fact hardly one of them had started for the Pyrenees\r\nby May[372], so that both in the Army of Portugal and the Army of the\r\nSouth the cavalry total was only a few hundreds smaller at the time of\r\nthe opening of the campaign of Vittoria than it had been at the New\r\nYear--the shrinkage amounting to no more than the squadron-cadres and\r\nthe few men for the Imperial Guard.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s intentions, therefore, as they became known to King\r\nJoseph and Jourdan on February 16th, left the three armies opposed to\r\nWellington some 15,000 men smaller than they had been at the time of\r\nthe Burgos retreat; but this was a very modest deduction considering\r\ntheir size, and still kept nearly 100,000 men in Castile and Leon, over\r\nand above the Army of the North, which might be considered as tied\r\ndown to its own duty of suppressing the rising in Biscay and Navarre,\r\nand incapable of sparing any help to its neighbours. When we reflect\r\non the scale of the Russian disaster, the demand made upon the Army of\r\nSpain seems very moderate. But there were two ominous doubts. Would\r\nthe Emperor be content with his original requisitions in men and horses\r\nfrom the armies of Spain? And what exactly did he mean by the phrase\r\nthat the King would have to lend _appui et secours_ to the Army of\r\nthe North, for the destruction of the rebels beyond the Ebro? If this\r\nsignified the distraction of any large body of men from the forces left\r\nopposed to Wellington, the situation would be uncomfortable. Both these\r\ndoubts soon developed into sinister certainties.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the Emperor’s original orders King Joseph hastened to\r\nobey, though the removal of his court from Madrid to Valladolid looked\r\nto him like the abandonment of his pose as King of Spain. He ordered\r\nSoult’s successor, Gazan, to evacuate La Mancha, and to draw back to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Madrid, leaving a small detachment of light troops\r\nabout Toledo. The Army of the South also took over the province of\r\nAvila from the Army of Portugal, and it was intended that it should\r\nsoon relieve the Army of the Centre in the province of Segovia. For\r\nJoseph had made up his mind that any help which he must give against\r\nthe northern rebels should be furnished by D’Erlon’s little army, which\r\nhe would stretch out from Segovia towards Burgos and the Ebro[373], and\r\nso take Mina and the insurgents of Navarre in the rear. Early in March\r\nall these movements were in progress, and (as we have seen in the last\r\nchapter) were beginning to be reported to Wellington, who made many\r\ndeductions from them. Joseph himself transferred his head-quarters to\r\nValladolid on March 23rd, by which time the greater part of the other\r\nchanges had been carried out. The Emperor afterwards criticized his\r\nbrother’s delay of a whole month between the receipt of his orders to\r\ndecamp and his actual arrival at Valladolid. To this Jourdan made the\r\nreply that it was useless to move the head-quarters till the drawing\r\nin of the Army of the South had been completed, and that the bringing\r\nin of such outlying units as Daricau’s division from the province of\r\nCuenca, and the transference of the Army of the Centre northward, took\r\nmuch time[374]. Evacuations cannot be carried out at a day’s notice,\r\nwhen they involve the moving of magazines and the calling in of a civil\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nOn March 12th, while all the movements were in progress, another batch\r\nof orders from Paris came to hand. They contained details which upset\r\nthe arrangements which the King was carrying out, for the Emperor\r\ndecided that the succour which was to be given to the Army of the North\r\nwas to be drawn from Reille’s Army, and not from D’Erlon’s, so that a\r\nnew series of counter-marches would have to be carried out. And--what\r\nwas more ominous for the future--Napoleon had dropped once more into\r\nhis old habit of sending orders directly to subordinate generals,\r\nwithout passing them through the head-quarters of the Army of Spain.\r\nFor Clarke, in his dispatch of February 3rd, informed the King that\r\nthe Emperor had sent Reille directions to detach a division to Navarre\r\nat once, ‘a disposition which cannot conflict with any orders which\r\nyour Majesty may give to the Army of Portugal, for the common end of\r\nreducing to submission the provinces of the North[375].’ Unfortunately\r\nthis was precisely what such an order did accomplish, for Joseph had\r\nsent D’Erlon in the direction to which he now found that Reille had\r\nsimultaneously detached Barbot’s division of the Army of Portugal,\r\nwithout any knowledge that D’Erlon had already been detailed for the\r\njob.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was falling back into the practice by which he had in the\r\npreceding year ruined Marmont--the issuing of detailed orders for the\r\nmovement of troops, based on information a month old, it being certain\r\nthat the execution of these orders would take place an additional three\r\nweeks after they had been formulated. As we shall presently see, the\r\ninitial successes of Wellington in his Vittoria campaign were entirely\r\ndue to the position in which the Army of Portugal had placed itself, in\r\nobedience to Napoleon’s direct instructions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clarke’s dispatch of February 2nd, conveying these orders,\r\narrived at the same moment as two others dated ten days later[376],\r\nwhich were most unpleasant reading. The first contained an absolutely\r\ninsulting message to the King from his brother: ‘his Imperial Majesty\r\nbids me say,’ wrote Clarke, ‘with regard to the money for which\r\nyou have asked in several recent letters, that all funds necessary\r\nfor the armies of Spain could have been got out of the rich and\r\nfertile provinces which are being devastated by the insurgent bands.\r\nBy employing the activity and vigour needed to establish order and\r\ntranquillity, the resources which they still possess can be utilized.\r\nThis is an additional motive for inducing your Majesty to put an end\r\nto this war in the interior, which troubles peaceful inhabitants,\r\nruins the countryside, exhausts your armies, and deprives them of\r\nthe resources which they could enjoy if these fine regions were in a\r\npeaceful state. Aragon and Navarre are to-day under Mina’s law, and\r\nmaintain this disastrous struggle with their food and money. It is time\r\nto put an end to this state of affairs.’\r\n\r\nWritten apparently a few hours later than the dispatch quoted above\r\ncame another[377], setting forth the policy which was to be the ruin\r\nof the French cause in Spain three months later. It is composed of a\r\nseries of wild miscalculations. When the head-quarters of the Army of\r\nSpain should have been moved to Valladolid, it would be possible to\r\nsend the whole Army of Portugal to help the Army of the North beyond\r\nthe Ebro. ‘The Armies of the Centre and South, occupying Salamanca and\r\nValladolid, have sufficient strength to keep the English in check,\r\nwhile waiting on events. Madrid and even Valencia are of secondary\r\nimportance. Valladolid and Salamanca have become the essential points,\r\nbetween which there should be distributed forces ready to take the\r\noffensive against the English, and to wreck their plans. The Emperor\r\nis informed that they have been reinforced in Portugal, and that they\r\nseem to have two alternative schemes--either to make a push into Spain,\r\nor to send out from the port of Lisbon an expedition of 25,000 men,\r\npartly English, partly Spanish, which is to land somewhere on the\r\nFrench coast, when the campaign shall have begun in Germany. To prevent\r\nthem engaging in this expedition, you must always be in a position to\r\nmarch forward and to threaten to overrun Portugal and take Lisbon. At\r\nthe same time you must make the communications with France safe and\r\neasy, by using the time of the English inactivity to subdue Biscay and\r\nNavarre.... If the French armies in Spain remain idle, and permit the\r\nEnglish to send expeditions against our coast, the tranquillity of\r\nFrance will be compromised, and the ruin of our cause in Spain will\r\ninfallibly follow.’\r\n\r\nA supplementary letter to Jourdan of the same day recapitulates all the\r\nabove points, adding that the Army of Portugal must send to Clausel,\r\nnow Caffarelli’s successor in the North, as many troops as are needed\r\nthere, but that the King at the same time must menace Portugal, so that\r\nWellington shall not be able to detach men from his Peninsular Army.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental error in all this is that, underrating Wellington’s\r\nstrength, Napoleon judged that the Armies of the South and Centre\r\ncould keep him in check. They were at this moment under 60,000 of\r\nall arms: if the Army of Portugal were out of the way, they were\r\nabsolutely insufficient for the task set them. As to their menacing\r\nLisbon, Wellington would have liked nothing better than an advance by\r\nthem into Portugal, where he would have outnumbered them hopelessly.\r\nThe hypothesis that Wellington was about to send 25,000 men by sea for\r\na landing inside the French Empire, on which Napoleon lays so much\r\nstress, seems to have been formed on erroneous information from French\r\nspies in London, who had heard the rumour that a raid on Holland or\r\nHanover was likely, or perhaps even one aimed at La Vendée. For the\r\nroyalist _émigrés_ in England had certainly been talking of such a\r\nplan, and pressing it upon Lord Liverpool, as the dispatches of the\r\nlatter to Wellington show[378]. The Emperor did not know that all such\r\nschemes would be scouted by the British Commander in Spain, and that he\r\nnow possessed influence enough with the Cabinet to stop them.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the Emperor’s intelligence from England misled him\r\nin other ways: he was duly informed of the departure from Lisbon of the\r\ndepleted cavalry and infantry units, about which Wellington disputed\r\nso much with the Duke of York, and the deduction drawn was that the\r\nPeninsular Army was being decreased. The exaggerated impression of the\r\nlosses in the Burgos retreat, which could be gathered from the Whig\r\nnewspapers, led to an underrating of the strength that the British Army\r\nwould have in the spring. Traitors from Cadiz wrote to Madrid that the\r\nfriction between the Regency and Wellington was so great, that it was\r\ndoubtful whether the new Generalissimo would have any real control\r\nover the Spanish armies. And the sickness in both the British and the\r\nPortuguese armies--bad as it was--was exaggerated by spies, so wildly\r\nthat the Emperor was under the delusion that Wellington could not count\r\non more than 30,000 British or 20,000 Portuguese troops in the coming\r\ncampaign. It may be worth while to quote at this point the official\r\nview at Paris of the British army in Portugal, though the words were\r\nwritten some time later, and only just before the news of Wellington’s\r\nsudden advance on the Douro had come to hand:\r\n\r\n‘In the position in which the enemy found himself there was no reason\r\nto fear that he would take the offensive: his remoteness, his lack of\r\ntransport, his constant and timid caution in all operations out of the\r\nordinary line, all announced that we had complete liberty to act as\r\nsuited us best, without worry or inconvenience. I may add that the ill\r\nfeeling between English and Spaniards, the voyage of Lord Wellington\r\nto Cadiz, the changes in his army, of which many regiments have been\r\nsent back to England, were all favourable circumstances allowing us to\r\ncarry out fearlessly every movement that the Emperor’s orders might\r\ndictate[379].’\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to observe that Wellington was not more remote\r\nfrom the French than they were from him: that he had excellent\r\ntransport--far better than his enemies ever enjoyed: that timid caution\r\nwas hardly the policy which stormed Badajoz or won Salamanca: that his\r\nrapid and triumphant offensive was just starting when the Minister of\r\nWar wrote the egregious paragraph which we have just cited. Persistent\r\nundervaluing of the resources and energy of Wellington by Head-quarters\r\nat Paris--i.e. by the Emperor when present, by the Minister of War in\r\nhis absence--was at the roots of the impending disaster.\r\n\r\nLeaving the King newly established at Valladolid, the Army of the South\r\nredistributing itself between Madrid and the Douro, the Army of the\r\nCentre turning back from its projected march to Burgos in order to\r\nreoccupy the province of Segovia, and the Army of Portugal beginning to\r\ndraw off from in front of Wellington troops to be sent to the North,\r\nwe must turn for a moment to explain the crisis in Navarre and Biscay\r\nwhich was engrossing so much of Napoleon’s attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN INSURRECTION. FEBRUARY-MAY 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been explained in an earlier chapter that ever since General\r\nCaffarelli concentrated all the available troops of the Army of\r\nthe North, in order to join Souham in driving away Wellington from\r\nthe siege of Burgos, the three Basque provinces, Navarre, and the\r\ncoast-land of Santander had been out of hand[380]. The outward\r\nand visible sign of that fact was the intermittent stoppage of\r\ncommunication between Bayonne and Madrid, which had so much irritated\r\nNapoleon on his return from Russia. It was undoubtedly a just cause\r\nof anger that important dispatches should be hung up at Tolosa,\r\nor Vittoria, or Burgos, because the bands of Mina or Mendizabal\r\nor Longa were holding the defile of Salinas--the grave of so many\r\nconvoy-escorts--or the pass of Pancorbo. It had been calculated in\r\n1811 that it might often require a small column of 250 men to bring an\r\nimperial courier safely through either of those perilous narrows. But\r\nin the winter of 1812-13 things had grown far worse. ‘The insurgents\r\nof Guipuzcoa, Navarre, and Aragon,’ as Clarke wrote to Jourdan with\r\nperfect truth[381], ‘have had six months to organize and train\r\nthemselves: their progress has been prodigious: they have formed many\r\nformidable corps, which no longer fear to face our troops when numbers\r\nare equal. They have called in the English, and receive every day arms,\r\nmunitions, and even cannon on the coast. They have actually begun\r\nto conduct regular sieges.’ Yet it was three months and more since\r\nthe King had sent back Caffarelli and the field-force of the Army of\r\nthe North from Valladolid, to restore order in the regions which had\r\nslipped out of hand during the great concentration of the French armies\r\nin November.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why the North had become so far more unquiet than it\r\nhad been in previous years, the answer must be that the cause was\r\nmoral and not material. It was not merely that many small places had\r\nbeen evacuated for a time by the French during the Burgos campaign,\r\nnor that the British fleet was throwing in arms and supplies at\r\nCastro-Urdiales or Santander. The important thing was that for the\r\nfirst time since 1808 the whole people had got a glimpse of hope:\r\nthe French had been driven out of Madrid; they had evacuated Biscay;\r\nOld Castile and Leon had been in the power of Wellington for several\r\nmonths. It was true that Madrid had been recovered, that Wellington\r\nhad been forced to retreat. But it was well known that the general\r\nresult of the campaign of 1812 had been to free all Southern Spain,\r\nand that the French had been on the verge of ruin in the early\r\nautumn. The prestige of the Imperial armies had received at Salamanca\r\na blow from which it never recovered. Wherefore the insurgents of\r\nthe North put forth during the winter of 1812-13 an energy such as\r\nthey had never before displayed, and the French generals gradually\r\ndiscovered that they had no longer to do with mere guerrillero bands,\r\nhalf-armed, half-fed wanderers in the hills, recruited only from the\r\ndesperate and the reckless, but with a whole people in arms. When\r\nCaffarelli returned from Burgos, he found that the Spanish authorities\r\nhad re-established themselves in every town which had been left\r\nungarrisoned, that taxes and requisitions were being levied in a\r\nregular fashion, and that new regiments were being formed and trained\r\nin Biscay and Guipuzcoa. The nominal Spanish commander in this region\r\nwas Mendizabal, theoretically Chief of the ‘Seventh Army’--but he was\r\nan officer of little resource and no authority. The real fighting man\r\nwas Longa, originally a guerrillero chief, but now gazetted a colonel\r\nin the regular army. He was a gunsmith from the Rioja, a very resolute\r\nand persistent man, who had taken to the hills early, and had outlived\r\nmost of his rivals and colleagues--a clear instance of the ‘survival\r\nof the fittest.’ His useful co-operation with Sir Home Popham in the\r\nlast autumn has been mentioned above: his band, now reorganized as\r\nfour infantry battalions, was raised from the mountaineers of the\r\nprovince of Santander and the region of the upper Ebro. His usual\r\nbeat lay between the sea and Burgos, and he was as frequently to be\r\nfound on the Cantabrian coast as at the defile of Pancorbo, where the\r\ngreat Bayonne _chaussée_ crosses from the watershed of the Ebro to\r\nthat of the Douro. His force never much exceeded 3,000 men, but they\r\nwere tough material--great marchers and (as they proved when serving\r\nunder Wellington) very staunch fighters on their own ground. West of\r\nLonga’s hunting grounds were those of Porlier, in the Eastern Asturias:\r\nthe star of the ‘Marquesito,’ as he was called, had paled somewhat\r\nof late, as the reputation of Longa had increased. He had never had\r\nagain such a stroke of luck as his celebrated surprise of Santander in\r\n1811[382], and the long French occupation of the Asturias in the days\r\nof Bonnet had worn down his band to little over 2,000 men. At this\r\nmoment he was mainly engaged, under the nominal command of Mendizabal,\r\nin keeping Santoña blockaded. To besiege it in form he had neither\r\nenough men nor a battering train: but if driven away once and again by\r\nCaffarelli, he never allowed himself to be caught, and was back again\r\nto stop the roads, the moment that the relieving column had marched\r\noff. In Biscay the leading spirit was Jauregui (El Pastor), another\r\nold ally of Sir Home Popham, but in addition to his band there was now\r\non foot a new organization of a more regular sort, three Biscayan and\r\nthree Guipuzcoan battalions, who had received arms from the English\r\ncruisers. They held all the interior of the country, had fortified the\r\nold citadel of Castro-Urdiales on the coast, with guns lent them from\r\nthe fleet, and co-operated with Mendizabal and Longa whenever occasion\r\noffered. They had held Bilbao for a time in the autumn, but were\r\nchased out of it when Caffarelli returned from Burgos. In January they\r\nmade another attempt upon it, but were repulsed by General Rouget, in\r\ncommand of the garrison.\r\n\r\nBetween the fields of operation of the Biscayans and Longa and that\r\nof the Navarrese insurgents, there was the line of the great Bayonne\r\n_chaussée_, held by a series of French garrisons at Tolosa, Bergara,\r\nMondragon, Vittoria, Miranda del Ebro, and the castle of Pancorbo.\r\nThis line of fortified places was a sore hindrance to the Spaniards,\r\nbut on many occasions they crossed it. Mina’s raiding battalions from\r\nNavarre were frequently seen in the Basque provinces. And they had\r\nmade communication between one garrison and another so dangerous that\r\nthe post-commanders often refused to risk men on escorts between one\r\nplace and the next, and had long ceased to attempt requisitions on\r\nthe countryside. They were fed by convoys pushed up the high road,\r\nwith heavy forces to guard them, at infrequent intervals. In Navarre,\r\nas has been already explained, Mina held the whole countryside, and\r\nhad set up an orderly form of government. He had at the most 8,000\r\nor 9,000 men, but they spread everywhere, sometimes operating in one\r\ncolumn, sometimes in many, seldom to be caught when sought after,\r\nand capable of turning on any rash pursuing force and overwhelming\r\nit, if its strength was seen to be over-small. Mina’s sphere of\r\naction extended far into Aragon, as far as Huesca, so that he was as\r\nmuch a plague to Paris, the Governor of Saragossa, as to Thouvenot,\r\nGovernor of Vittoria, or Abbé, Governor of Pampeluna. His strategical\r\npurpose, if we may ascribe such a thing to one who was, after all,\r\nbut a guerrillero of special talent and energy, was to break the line\r\nof communication down the Ebro from Miranda to Saragossa, the route\r\nby which the King and the Army of the North kept up their touch with\r\nSuchet’s troops in Aragon. It was a tempting objective, since all down\r\nthe river there were French garrisons at short distances in Haro,\r\nLogroño, Viana, Calahorra, Milagro, Tudela, and other places, none of\r\nthem very large, and each capable of being isolated, and attacked for\r\nsome days, before the Governor of Navarre could come to its aid with a\r\nstrong relieving column. And there were other garrisons, such as those\r\nat Tafalla and Huesca, covering outlying road-centres, which were far\r\nfrom succour and liable to surprise-attacks at any moment.\r\n\r\nNor was Mina destitute of the power to call in help for one of his\r\ngreater raids--he sometimes shifted towards the coast, and got in touch\r\nwith the Guipuzcoans and Biscayans, while he had also communication\r\nwith Duran, south of the Ebro. This officer who was theoretically a\r\ndivision-commander in the Valencian Army, was really the leader of a\r\nband of four or five thousand irregulars, who hung about the mountains\r\nof Soria, and kept the roads from Madrid to Saragossa and the Ebro\r\nblocked. And Duran was again in touch with the Empecinado, whose\r\nbeat lay on the east side of New Castile, and whose main object was\r\nto molest the French garrisons of Guadalajara, Segovia, and Alcalá.\r\nTemporary combinations of formidable strength could be made, when\r\nseveral of these irregular forces joined for a common raid: but the\r\nchiefs generally worked apart, each disliking to move very far from\r\nhis own district, where he was acquainted with the roads and the\r\ninhabitants. For in a country of chaotic sierras, like Northern Spain,\r\nlocal knowledge was all-important: to be aware of exactly what paths\r\nand passes were practicable in January snow, or what torrents were\r\nfordable in March rain, was the advantage which the guerrillero had\r\nover his enemy. It is probable that in March or April 1813 the total\r\nforce of all the insurgent bands was no greater than that of the French\r\ngarrisons and movable columns with which they had to contend. But\r\nthe Army of the North was forced to tie down the larger half of its\r\nstrength to holding strategical points and long lines of communication,\r\nwhile the guerrilleros could evacuate one whole region for weeks at a\r\ntime, in order to mass in another. They could be unexpectedly strong\r\nin one district, yet lose nothing by temporary abandonment of another.\r\nThey were admirably served for intelligence, since the whole population\r\nwas by goodwill or by fear at their service: the French could only\r\ndepend on _afrancesados_ for information, and these were timid and\r\nfew; they grew fewer as Mina gradually discovered and hanged traitors.\r\nWhen the French columns had gone by, it was easily to be guessed who\r\nhad guided them or given them news--and such people perished, or had\r\nto migrate to the nearest garrison. But local knowledge was the real\r\nstrength of the guerrilleros: a French column-commander, guiding\r\nhis steps from the abominable maps of Lopez--the atlas which was\r\nuniversally used for want of a better--was always finding his enemy\r\nescape by a path unindicated on the map, or appear in his rear over\r\nsome unknown cross-road, which could not have been suspected to exist.\r\nHence the local Spanish traitor was absolutely necessary as a guide,\r\nand often he could not be found--treachery having been discovered to\r\nbe a path that led inevitably to the gallows. The Army of the North\r\nhad acquired, from old and painful experience of counter-marches,\r\nsome general knowledge of the cross-roads between the Ebro and the\r\nPyrenees. But when troops from a distance--sections of the Bayonne\r\nReserve, or reinforcements from the Army of Portugal--were turned on to\r\nthe game of guerrillero-hunting, they found themselves very helpless.\r\nAs a rule, the most promising march ended in finding the lair still\r\nwarm, but the quarry invisible.\r\n\r\nNapoleon and his mouthpiece, the War Minister Clarke, refused to the\r\nend, as Marshal Marmont remarked[383], to see that the War of Spain\r\nwas unlike any other war that the French armies had waged since 1792.\r\nThe nearest parallels to it were the fighting in Switzerland in 1798\r\nand against Hofer’s Tyrolese in 1809. But both of these earlier\r\ninsurrectionary wars had been fought on a very limited area, against\r\nan enemy of no great numerical strength, practically unhelped from\r\nwithout. In Spain the distances were very great, the mountains--if less\r\nhigh than the Alps--were almost as tiresome, for in the Alps there were\r\nvast tracts completely inaccessible to both sides, but the Sierras,\r\nif rugged, are less lofty and better furnished with goat-tracks and\r\nsmugglers’ by-ways, where the heavily laden infantryman cannot follow\r\nthe evasive mountaineer. Moreover, the English cruisers continued to\r\ndrop in the arms and munitions without which the insurgents could not\r\nhave kept the field.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Napoleon undervalued the power of the\r\nSpanish guerrilleros, just as he undervalued the resources and the\r\nenterprise of Wellington. From the first moment of his return from\r\nRussia he had continued to impress on Joseph and Jourdan the necessity\r\nfor pacifying the North, before the season for regular campaigning\r\nshould have arrived, and Wellington should have taken the field. But\r\nhis theory that the winter was the best time for dealing with the\r\nbands was rather specious than correct. For although the short days,\r\nthe snow in the passes, and the swollen torrents were, no doubt,\r\ngreat hindrances to that freedom of movement which was the main\r\nstrength of the guerrilleros, they were even greater hindrances to\r\ncombined operations by bodies of regular troops. Rapid marches are\r\nimpossible off the high roads in Northern Spain, during the midwinter\r\nmonths; and it was only by combined operations and the use of large\r\nforces that the insurgents could be dealt with. Indeed, the country\r\nroads were practically impassable for any regular troops in many\r\nregions. What officer would risk detachments in upland valleys that\r\nmight be found to be blocked with snow, or cut off from their usual\r\ncommunication by furious streams that had overflowed the roads and made\r\nfords impracticable? Winter marches in unexplored hills are the most\r\ndeadly expedients: all the weakly soldiers fall by the way--had not\r\nDrouet lost 150 men in passing the Guadarrama during the early days\r\nof December--and the Guadarrama was crossed by one of the few great\r\nroyal roads of Spain? What would be the losses of columns sent out on\r\ncross-roads and caught in blizzards, or in those weeks of continuous\r\nrain which are not uncommon in the sub-Pyrenean region?\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s view was that Caffarelli had failed in his task from want\r\nof resourcefulness. He was always trying to parry blows rather than to\r\nstrike himself: he allowed the insurgents to take the initiative, and\r\nwhen they had executed some tiresome raid would set out in a pursuit\r\nwhich was seldom useful, since they naturally outran him[384]. He was\r\nalways marching to deliver or revictual some threatened garrison,\r\nanywhere between Santoña and Pampeluna, instead of setting himself to\r\ndestroy the main agglomeration of hostile forces. Now Caffarelli, it is\r\ntrue, was no great general, and may have been on occasion wanting in\r\nvigour. But the best reply to the criticism of him sent from Paris is\r\nto observe that his successor, Clausel, universally acknowledged to be\r\nthe most active officer in Spain, failed in exactly the same way as his\r\npredecessor, even when he had been lent 20,000 veteran troops to aid\r\nhim in his task.\r\n\r\nNapoleon wanted a great general movement _pour balayer tout le Nord_.\r\nHe granted that Caffarelli had not enough troops both to furnish\r\ngarrisons for every important point, and to hunt down the guerrilleros\r\nwith a large field-force. Therefore he ordered Reille to furnish\r\nCaffarelli’s successor with every man that he asked for. If necessary,\r\nthe whole Army of Portugal might be requisitioned, since those of the\r\nSouth and Centre would be enough to keep Wellington in check. The\r\nletter of instructions which Clarke was directed to give to Clausel,\r\nwhen the latter took up his appointment, explains the Emperor’s views.\r\n‘By a continual taking of the offensive it ought to be possible to\r\nreach a prompt and happy result. The moment that the reinforcements\r\nto be furnished by General Reille arrive (and possibly they have\r\nalready put themselves at your disposition) in Navarre and Biscay, I\r\nam convinced that your usual activity will change the face of affairs.\r\nRapid pursuits, well directed, and above all properly adapted to the\r\ntopographical configuration of the district; raids made without warning\r\non the insurgents’ dépôts of provisions, their hospitals, their stores\r\nof arms, and in general on all their magazines, will infallibly carry\r\nconfusion into their operations. After you have had some successful\r\nengagements with them, it will only require politic measures to\r\ncomplete their disorganization. When you have scattered their juntas,\r\nall the young men they have enrolled by compulsion will melt home. If\r\nyou leave them no rest, and surprise them in their remotest places of\r\nrefuge, the matter should end by their going wholly to pieces.... As\r\nto the keeping open your communication with France, one particular\r\ndevice, to whose utility all the generals who have served in that\r\nregion bear witness, is to establish at regular distances and in well\r\nchosen positions, especially where roads meet, small palisaded forts,\r\nor blockhouses, which will form a chain of posts and support each\r\nother. Owing to the wooded nature of the country they will not cost\r\nmuch to build--the estimate for such a system of blockhouses has been\r\ncalculated to me at no more than 300,000 francs.\r\n\r\n‘Santoña and Pampeluna must be held--the latter because its capture is\r\nMina’s main ambition, the former because it is a terror to the English,\r\nwho recently tried to have it besieged: General Caffarelli had to lead\r\nan expedition to relieve it. Pampeluna is the more important for the\r\nmoment: when a division of the Army of Portugal reaches Navarre you\r\nought to be able to make Mina change his tone. Santoña can wait--it may\r\nbe reprovisioned by sea from the small ports of Biscay. As General\r\nCaffarelli has inconsiderately evacuated most of them, you should\r\nreoccupy them all, especially Bermeo and Castro-Urdiales. The latter is\r\nsaid to have been fortified with the help of the English. For the sake\r\nof the safety of Santoña all these places must be retaken at once: from\r\nthe mouth of the Bidassoa to Santander every maritime position should\r\nbe in French hands. Santander especially is, by the Emperor’s express\r\norders, to be permanently occupied by an adequate garrison.\r\n\r\n‘It is necessary that all these operations should be carried out\r\nsimultaneously. The pursuit of Mina in Navarre should synchronize\r\nwith the operations in Biscay. The insurgents should be hunted in the\r\ninland, at the same time that they are attacked on the coast. This is\r\nthe only way to disorganize them, to make them weak and divided at\r\nall points.... It seems preferable to use every available man for a\r\ngeneral simultaneous attack, than to undertake each necessary operation\r\nin succession, with a smaller force and more leisure--all the more so\r\nbecause the reinforcements, which are to co-operate in your scheme, may\r\nbe called elsewhere by some unforeseen development of affairs[385].’\r\n\r\nClausel, in obedience to his instructions, tried to carry out the\r\nwhole of this scheme, and had small luck therewith. He built the\r\nchain of blockhouses from Irun to Burgos, thereby tying up many\r\nbattalions to sedentary duty. He hunted Mina right and left, drove the\r\ninsurrectionary Junta of Biscay from its abode, occupied all the little\r\nports from Santander to San Sebastian, stormed the well-fortified\r\nCastro-Urdiales, revictualled Pampeluna and Santoña, and at the end\r\nof three months had to report that his task was unfinished, that the\r\ninsurrection was still unsubdued, and that although he had borrowed\r\n20,000 infantry from the Army of Portugal, he must ask for another\r\n20,000 men [where were they to be got?] in order to finish the\r\ncampaign. And by this time--the end of May--Wellington was loose, and\r\nthe King was falling back on the Ebro, vainly calling for the five\r\ndivisions that his brother had made over to the Army of the North.\r\nBut we must resume the chronicle of the Northern campaign, before\r\ncommenting on its inadequate and unhappy conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe operations may be said to have begun in January, when Palombini’s\r\nItalian division marched from Old Castile to join the Army of the\r\nNorth, in order to replace Dumoustier’s brigade of the Young Guard,\r\nwhich was being recalled to France. After crossing the Guadarrama\r\nPass in a blizzard, which cost some lives, they got to Burgos on the\r\n28th, driving away the Cura Merino and his band, who had been blocking\r\nthe road from Valladolid. From Burgos Palombini marched to Vittoria,\r\nescorting a convoy of drafts returning to France, couriers, officials,\r\nand convalescents. There he heard that Longa and Mendizabal had cut in\r\nbehind him, and had again stopped communications. Wherefore he turned\r\nback, and swept the Bureba, where they were reported to be. Not finding\r\nthem, he marched as far as Poza de la Sal, not far from Briviesca, but\r\nsome leagues off the great _chaussée_. In this town his head-quarters\r\nwere fixed, while the bulk of his division was sent out in flying\r\ncolumns to collect food. He had only 500 men with him, when on the\r\nnight of February 10-11 he found himself surrounded by three Spanish\r\ncolumns, which had slipped through the intervals of the outlying\r\nItalian regiments, and ran in on the town from different quarters. The\r\nsurprise, contrived by Longa, was complete; but Palombini, collecting\r\nhis men in a clump, held out till daylight, when his battalions\r\ncame flocking in to the sound of the musketry and relieved him. The\r\nSpaniards disappeared, taking with them some baggage and prisoners\r\ncaptured in the first rush, and were soon lost to sight in the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe Italians, lucky to have escaped so cheaply, marched back to the\r\nEbro by way of Domingo Calzada, where there was a French garrison in\r\nimminent danger of starvation, as it had long been blockaded by local\r\nbands[386]. Palombini took it on with him, and blew up the castle, as\r\nthe place was inconveniently remote from any other French post. He\r\nthen returned to Vittoria by way of Haro (February 18) and next pushed\r\non to Bilbao, where he relieved Dumoustier’s brigade of the Imperial\r\nGuard, which was at last able to obey the Emperor’s order to return to\r\nFrance (February 21). Caffarelli used this force as his escort back\r\nto Bayonne, and returned in some disgrace to Paris. Clausel assumed\r\ncommand in his stead on the next day.\r\n\r\nPampeluna had been declared by the new commander’s letter of\r\ninstructions to be the place of which he should be most careful. But\r\nseeing no chance of visiting and relieving it till his reinforcements\r\nfrom the Army of Portugal should have come up, Clausel, while waiting\r\nfor their arrival, came to Bilbao, where he began to make preparations\r\nfor the siege of Castro-Urdiales, by far the most important, for the\r\nmoment, of the ports along the coast which the Emperor had commended to\r\nhim for destruction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Biscayan insurgents collected opposite Bilbao, on the\r\nEastern side, and Mendizabal brought up Longa’s troops and some of\r\nthe smaller bands to threaten it from the West. The idea was to give\r\nClausel so much trouble about his head-quarters that he would be\r\nunable to march away against Castro. The days slipped by, and farther\r\nEast Mina was more active than ever in Navarre. He had at last become\r\nthe happy possessor of two siege guns, landed at Deba on the Biscay\r\ncoast, and dragged by incredible exertions across mountain paths to the\r\nfarthest inland. When they came to hand he set to work to beleaguer\r\nthe French garrison of Tafalla, an outlying place, but less than\r\nthirty miles from Pampeluna. This was a challenge to General Abbé,\r\nthe Governor of Navarre: a force which has dug trenches and brought\r\nup heavy guns is obviously asking for a fight, and not intending to\r\nabscond. Abbé marched with 3,000 infantry and 150 chasseurs to raise\r\nthe siege, and found Mina with four of his battalions and his regiment\r\nof cavalry drawn up across the high road, in a mountain position at\r\nTiebas, ten miles north of Tafalla. After a hard day’s fighting,\r\nAbbé failed to break through, and had to fall back on Pampeluna[387]\r\n(February 9). The news of his repulse disheartened the garrison, whose\r\nwalls were crumbling under the fire of Mina’s heavy guns, and they\r\nsurrendered on February 11th to the number of 11 officers and 317\r\nmen--the post-commander and many others had been killed during the\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nThis success of Mina’s meant nothing less than that the whole open\r\ncountry of Navarre was at his mercy, since Abbé had been beaten in the\r\nfield; wherefore Clausel hastened to dispatch the first reinforcements\r\nfrom the Army of Portugal which reached him--Barbot’s division--to\r\nthis quarter. But the affair created less excitement than an exploit\r\nof reckless courage carried out by one of Mina’s detachments in the\r\nfollowing month. The old castle of Fuenterrabia commands the passage of\r\nthe Bidassoa, and looks across its estuary into France: on March 11 it\r\nwas surprised by escalade by a handful of guerrilleros, the garrison\r\ntaken prisoner, the guns thrown into the water, and the whole building\r\ndestroyed by fire. The flames were visible far into France--troops\r\nhurried up from Irun and Hendaye, but of course found the guerrilleros\r\ngone[388].\r\n\r\nThis exploit was rather spectacular than harmful to the French--quite\r\notherwise was the last event of the month of March. Barbot’s division,\r\non entering Navarre, was directed to help Abbé to clear the country\r\nbetween Pampeluna and the Ebro. Having reached Lodosa on March\r\n30, Barbot sent out two battalions to raise requisitions in the\r\nneighbouring town of Lerin. The place was being sacked, when the\r\nscattered French were suddenly attacked by two of Mina’s battalions,\r\nwhile two more and 200 Navarrese lancers cut in between the enemy and\r\nLodosa. The French, thoroughly surprised, lost heavily in the first\r\nshock, but rallied and started to cut their way back to their division,\r\nonly eight miles away. In a running fight they were much mauled, and\r\nfinally had to form square to receive the cavalry. In this inconvenient\r\nformation they were forced to a long musketry fight with the Navarrese,\r\nwhich so shook the square that it finally broke when Mina’s lancers\r\ncharged. The two battalions were annihilated, 28 officers and 635 men\r\ntaken prisoners--the rest cut down. Gaudin, the colonel commanding\r\nthe detachment, escaped with a few mounted officers[389]. The\r\nextraordinary part of the affair was that its last crisis took place at\r\nonly two miles from Lodosa, where Barbot was lying with his remaining\r\nsix battalions. The French general never stirred, but only put himself\r\nin a posture of defence, thereby provoking Mina’s surprise[390], for\r\nhe could have saved the column by going out to its help. After the\r\ndisaster he retired to Pampeluna, with a division reduced to little\r\nover 3,000 men. But not long after Taupin’s division of the Army of\r\nPortugal also entered Navarre, and joined Abbé. This gave the latter a\r\nvery heavy force--at least 13,000 men, and when Clausel had finished\r\nhis own operations in the direction of Bilbao, and marched from Biscay\r\nto encircle Mina on one side, while Abbé was to hold him on the other,\r\nthe great guerrillero was in grave danger. But this was only in late\r\nApril and May, and before the chronicle of these weeks is reached we\r\nhave to turn back westward for a space.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s orders had told Clausel to attack at all points at once,\r\nand to lose no time in setting to work. But it was quite clear that\r\nno general synchronized move could be made, until the divisions\r\nborrowed from Reille had all arrived. What active operations meant,\r\nbefore the reinforcements had come up, had been sufficiently proved\r\nby Abbé’s defeat at Tiebas: and Clausel’s own doings in March were\r\nequally discouraging, if not so disastrous. He had resolved to carry\r\nout one of the Emperor’s urgent orders by capturing Castro-Urdiales,\r\nthe touching-place of British cruisers and the one fortified port which\r\nthe Allies possessed on the Biscay coast. Undervaluing its strength, he\r\nmarched out on March 21 with the bulk of Palombini’s Italian division\r\nand a single French battalion, intending to take it by escalade.\r\nFor he had been told that its ancient walls had been indifferently\r\nrepaired, and were almost without guns. When, however, he had reached\r\nthe neighbourhood of Castro on the 22nd, he had to own on inspection\r\nthat the enterprise would be hopeless--his commanding engineer, the\r\nhistorian Vacani[391]--maintained that it would take 6,000 men and a\r\nsiege train of at least six heavy guns to deal with the place. And,\r\nas subsequent events showed, this was quite true. Castro is built on\r\na rocky spit projecting into the sea, with a stout wall 20 feet high\r\ndrawn across the isthmus which joins the headland to the coast. The\r\nnarrow front of this wall, from water to water, had been well repaired;\r\nthere were some 20 guns mounted, and an old castle on the extreme\r\nsea-ward point of the spit served as a citadel or inner fortification.\r\nMendizabal and his lieutenant, Campillo, had come down from the\r\ninterior with three or four thousand men, and were visible on the\r\nflank, ready to fall upon the Italian column if it should approach the\r\ntown, through the labyrinth of vineyards and stone fences which covered\r\nits outskirts.\r\n\r\nClausel, always venturesome, was inclined at first to go on with his\r\nenterprise, when news reached him that Bilbao, which he had left rather\r\nweakly garrisoned, was threatened by the guerrillero Jauregui, and\r\nthe battalions of the volunteers of Biscay and Guipuzcoa. He returned\r\nhastily to his head-quarters with his French battalion, but found that\r\nthe danger had been exaggerated for the moment, so sent out General\r\nRouget with two battalions to join Palombini, who had meanwhile on the\r\n24th fought a severe action with Mendizabal. The Spaniard had tried\r\nto surround him in his camp at San Pelayo, with several outflanking\r\ncolumns--the Italian sallied out and drove him off with loss--but\r\nsuffered himself no less[392]. Clausel, on reaching the front, came\r\nto the conclusion that Castro must not be attacked without heavy guns\r\nand a larger field-force. He directed Palombini to burn the ladders,\r\nfascines, &c., prepared for the assault, and to go off instead to raise\r\nthe blockade of Santoña, while he himself returned to Bilbao. The\r\nItalian division therefore marched westward on Colindres, on the other\r\nside of the bay on which Santoña stands, thrusting aside the Spanish\r\nblockading forces, and communicated with the governor, General Lameth.\r\nA supply of small arms and ammunition, money, and food was thrown into\r\nthe place. On the other hand, Lameth was ordered to get six heavy guns\r\non shipboard, and to be prepared to run them down the coast, when next\r\na French force should appear in front of Castro-Urdiales, along with a\r\nprovision of round shot, shells, and entrenching tools. Lameth got the\r\nsiege material ready, but was not asked for it till another full month\r\nhad gone by, for Clausel had other business pressed upon him.\r\n\r\nPalombini thereupon turned back, and regained Bilbao in three forced\r\nmarches, unmolested by the Spaniards, for they had gone off in the\r\ndirection of Balmaseda, not expecting him to return so quickly. He\r\nhad only been in Bilbao for two days when Clausel sent him out again,\r\neastward this time and not westward, with two of his regiments, for\r\na surprise attack on Guernica, the head-quarters of the Biscayan\r\ninsurgents and the seat of their Junta. A French column of two\r\nbattalions of the 40th Line from Durango was to co-operate and to\r\nassail the enemy in the rear. This expedition was quite in consonance\r\nwith Napoleon’s orders to strike at the enemy’s central dépôts in front\r\nand rear by unexpected raids. But it also showed the difficulty of\r\ncarrying out such plans. Palombini reached Guernica, driving before him\r\nbands which gave way, but were always growing stronger: behind Guernica\r\nthey made a stand--the French flanking column failed to appear--having\r\nfound troubles of its own--and Palombini was repulsed and forced to\r\ncut his way back out of the hills. He reported his loss as only 80\r\nmen--but it was probably somewhat more[393] (April 2). Having picked up\r\nthe stray French column, and replenished his ammunition from Bilbao,\r\nPalombini, with a laudable perseverance, attacked the Guernica position\r\nagain on April 5, and this time forced it. Thence pushing east, he\r\ntried to drive the enemy before him along the coast road, on which, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of St. Sebastian, a brigade from the Bayonne reserve\r\nhad been set to block their flight. But the Biscayans and El Pastor\r\nevaded him and slipped south into the hills: the Guipuzcoan battalions,\r\ninstinctively falling back on their own province, were in more danger.\r\nBut warned in time that the coast road was stopped, some of them took\r\nrefuge in the boats of English warships at Lequeytio and Motrico, and\r\nwere shipped off to Castro-Urdiales in safety, while others simply\r\ndispersed. No prisoners were taken, but Palombini captured the petty\r\nmagazines of the Guipuzcoans at Aspeytia and Azcoytia, and thinking\r\nthat the insurrection was scotched returned to the Bayonne _chaussée_\r\nat Bergara (April 9).\r\n\r\nSo far was this from ending the campaign, that while Palombini was\r\ndevastating Guipuzcoa, the Biscayans and El Pastor had concerted a new\r\nattack on Bilbao with Longa and Mendizabal, who had been left with\r\nno containing force in front of them when the enemy had retired from\r\nbefore Castro-Urdiales.\r\n\r\nClausel had gone off from Bilbao on March 30, with a large escort,\r\nto join at Vittoria the newly arrived divisions of the Army of\r\nPortugal, those of Taupin and Foy, and was set on organizing a new\r\nattack on Mina. In the absence of both the Commander-in-Chief and of\r\nPalombini, Bilbao was very weakly garrisoned--not more than 2,000 men\r\nwere left to General Rouget to defend a rather extensive system of\r\noutworks. On April 10th the Spaniards attacked him on both sides of\r\nthe Nervion river, and would probably have broken into Bilbao but for\r\nthe incapacity of Mendizabal, whose main body did not come up in time\r\nto assist the attack of the Biscayans on the other bank of the river.\r\nRouget was still holding out when Palombini came to his rescue from\r\nBergara via Durango, in two forced marches. The Spaniards thereupon\r\ndispersed, after their usual fashion, Mendizabal disappearing to\r\nthe east, the Biscayans falling back on their old head-quarters at\r\nGuernica. Palombini was strong at the moment, having been joined by the\r\nbrigade from Bayonne, under General Aussenac, which had been blocking\r\nthe coast road. He therefore tried to surround the Biscayans with\r\nconverging columns--but when he thought that he had cut them off from\r\nthe inland, and was about to drive them into the water, the bulk of\r\nthem were picked up at Bermeo by English cruisers, and landed farther\r\ndown the coast. Only some baggage and a store of munitions fell into\r\nthe pursuer’s hands (April 14).\r\n\r\nOn this, Palombini, ‘convinced,’ says his admiring chronicler Vacani,\r\n‘of the uselessness of trying to envelop or destroy local bands among\r\nmountains which they knew too well, when he could only dispose of\r\ncolumns of a few battalions for the pursuit,’ resolved to halt at\r\nBilbao, and prepare for the siege of Castro. He put the brigade from\r\nBayonne in charge of the high road to San Sebastian, and waited for\r\nthe arrival of Foy from Vittoria. For he had been informed that this\r\ngeneral, with his division of the Army of Portugal, was to be detailed\r\nto help him in the subjection of Biscay. Meanwhile April was half over,\r\nthe insurgents had been often hunted but never caught, and Wellington\r\nmight be expected to be on the move any morning: it was strange that he\r\nhad not been heard of already.\r\n\r\nLeaving Biscay to Palombini and Foy, Clausel had collected at Vittoria\r\none of his own divisions, hitherto scattered in small detachments, but\r\nrelieved by the reinforcements sent him from the Army of Portugal.\r\nFor beside the four divisions lent for active service, he had taken\r\nover the whole Province of Burgos, to which Reille had sent the\r\ndivision of Lamartinière. With his own newly-collected division, under\r\nVandermaesen, and Taupin’s of the Army of Portugal, Clausel set out for\r\nNavarre on April 11th, to combine his operations with those of Abbé and\r\nto hunt down Mina. As he had already sent forward to the Governor of\r\nNavarre the division of Barbot, there was now a field-force of 20,000\r\nmen available for the chase, without taking into consideration the\r\ntroops tied down in garrisons. This was more than double the strength\r\nthat Mina could command, and the next month was one of severe trial for\r\nthe great guerrillero.\r\n\r\nClausel’s first idea was to catch Mina by a sweeping movement of all\r\nhis four divisions, which he collected at Puente la Reyna in the valley\r\nof the Arga (April 24). Mina answered this move by dispersion, and\r\nhis battalions escaped through intervals in the cordon with no great\r\nloss, and cut up more than once small detachments of their pursuers.\r\nClausel perceiving that this system was useless, then tried another,\r\none of those recommended by the Emperor in his letter of instruction of\r\nMarch 9, viz. a resolute stroke at the enemy’s magazines and dépôts.\r\nMina kept his hospitals, some rough munition factories which he had\r\nset up, and his store of provisions, in the remote Pyrenean valley\r\nof Roncal, where Navarre and Aragon meet: it was most inaccessible\r\nand far from any high road. Nevertheless Clausel marched upon it with\r\nthe divisions of Abbé, Vandermaesen, and Barbot, leaving Taupin alone\r\nat Estella to contain Western Navarre. He calculated that Mina would\r\nbe forced to concentrate and fight, in order to save his stores and\r\narsenal, and that so he might be destroyed. He was partly correct in\r\nhis hypothesis--but only partly. Mina left four of his battalions in\r\nWestern Navarre, in the valleys of the Amescoas, to worry Taupin, and\r\nhurried with the remaining five to cover the Roncal. There was heavy\r\nfighting in the passes leading to it on May 12 and 13, which ended in\r\nthe Navarrese being beaten and dispersed with the loss of a thousand\r\nmen. Clausel captured and destroyed the factories and magazines,\r\nand made prisoners of the sick in the hospitals, whom he treated\r\nwith unexpected humanity. Some of the broken battalions fled south\r\nby Sanguesa into lower Navarre, others eastward into Aragon. Among\r\nthese last was Mina himself with a small party of cavalry--he tried\r\nto fetch a compass round the pursuing French and to return to his own\r\ncountry, but he was twice headed off, and finally forced to fly far\r\ninto Eastern Aragon, as far as Barbastro. This region was practically\r\nopen to him for flight, for the French garrison of Saragossa was too\r\nweak to cover the whole country, or to stop possible bolt-holes. Mina\r\nwas therefore able to rally part of his men there, and called in the\r\nhelp of scattered _partidas_. Clausel swept all North-Western Aragon\r\nwith his three divisions, making arrests and destroying villages which\r\nhad harboured the insurgents. But he did not wish to pursue Mina to the\r\nborders of Catalonia, where he would have been quite out of his own\r\nbeat, and inconveniently remote from Pampeluna and Vittoria.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the division which he had left under Taupin in Navarre\r\nwas having much trouble with Mina’s four battalions in the Amescoas,\r\nand parties drifting back from the rout in the Roncal vexed the\r\nnorthern bank of the Ebro, while Longa and Mendizabal, abandoning\r\ntheir old positions in front of Bilbao, had descended on to the\r\nBayonne _chaussée_, and executed many raids upon it, from the pass\r\nof Salinas above Vittoria as far as the Ebro (April 25-May 10). The\r\ncommunications between Bayonne and Burgos were once more cut, and the\r\nsituation grew so bad that Lamartinière’s division of the Army of\r\nPortugal had to be moved eastward, to clear the road from Burgos to\r\nMiranda, Sarrut’s to do the same between Miranda and Bilbao, while\r\nMaucune detached a brigade to relieve Lamartinière at Burgos. Of the\r\nwhole Army of Portugal there was left on May 20th only one single\r\ninfantry brigade at Palencia which was still at Reille’s disposition.\r\nFive and a half divisions had been lent to Clausel, and were dispersed\r\nin the north. And Wellington was now just about to move! The worst\r\nthing of all for the French cause was that the communications of the\r\nNorth were as bad in May as they had been in January: after Clausel had\r\ntaken off the main field-army to the Roncal, and had led it from thence\r\nfar into Aragon, the roads behind him were absolutely useless. Only on\r\nthe line Bayonne-Vittoria, where the new blockhouses were beginning to\r\narise, was any regular passing to and fro possible. Clausel himself was\r\nabsolutely lost to sight, so far as King Joseph was concerned--it took\r\na fortnight or twenty days to get a dispatch through to him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, before turning to the great campaign of Wellington on\r\nthe Douro, it is necessary to dispose of the chronicle of affairs\r\nin Biscay. Foy and his division, as we have seen, had marched from\r\nVittoria to Bilbao and reached the latter place on April 21st[394]. On\r\nthe way they had nearly caught Mendizabal at Orduña, where he chanced\r\nto be present with a guard of only 200 men; but, warned just in time,\r\nhe had the luck to escape, and went back to pick up his subordinates\r\nLonga and Campillo nearer the coast.\r\n\r\nSoon after Foy’s arrival at Bilbao he was joined by Sarrut’s division\r\nof the Army of Portugal, which had followed him from Vittoria. He had\r\ntherefore, counting Palombini’s Italians, the brigade of Aussenac, and\r\nthe regular garrison of Bilbao, at least 16,000 men--ample for the task\r\nthat Clausel had commended to him, the capture of Castro-Urdiales,\r\nwith its patched-up mediaeval wall. The only thing presenting any\r\ndifficulty was getting a siege train to this remote headland: Lameth,\r\nthe Governor of Santoña, as it will be remembered, had been ordered to\r\nprovide one, and there were four heavy guns in Bilbao:--the roads on\r\nboth sides, however, were impracticable, and the artillery had to come\r\nby water, running the chance of falling in with British cruisers.\r\n\r\nOn April 25th Foy marched out of Bilbao with his own, Sarrut’s, and\r\nPalombini’s divisions, more than 11,000 men,[395] leaving Aussenac on\r\nthe Deba, to guard the road from San Sebastian, and Rouget in garrison\r\nas usual. On the same evening he reached the environs of Castro, and\r\nleft Palombini there to shut in the place, while he went on himself\r\nto look for Mendizabal, who was known to be watching affairs from the\r\nhills, and to be blocking the road to Santoña, as he had so often\r\ndone before. Foy then moved on to Cerdigo where he established his\r\nhead-quarters for the siege, on a strong position between the sea and\r\nthe river Agaera. Mendizabal was reputed to be holding the line of\r\nthe Ason, ten miles farther on, but in weak force: he had only the\r\n_partidas_ of Campillo and Herrero with him, Longa being absent in\r\nthe direction of Vittoria. On the 29th Foy drove off these bands at\r\nAmpuero, and communicated with Santoña, into which he introduced a\r\ndrove of 500 oxen and other victuals. The governor Lameth was ordered\r\nto ship the siege train that he had collected to Islares, under\r\nthe camp at Cerdigo, on the first day when he should find the bay\r\nclear--for three English sloops, the _Lyra_, _Royalist_, and _Sparrow_,\r\nunder Captain Bloye, were lying off Castro and watching the coast. Foy\r\nthen established Sarrut’s division to cover the siege at Trucios, and\r\nsent two Italian battalions to Portugalete to guard the road to Bilbao,\r\nkeeping his own division and the three other Italian battalions for the\r\nactual trench work. The heavy guns were the difficulty--those expected\r\nfrom Bilbao were stopped at the mouth of the Nervion by the English\r\nsquadron, which was watching for them--but in the absence of the sloops\r\non this quest, the governor of Santoña succeeded in running his convoy\r\nacross the bay on May 4th. The guns from Bilbao were afterwards brought\r\nup by land, with much toil.\r\n\r\nFoy then commenced three batteries on the high slopes which dominate\r\nthe town: two were completed on the 6th, despite much long-distance\r\nfire from the British ships, and from a heavy gun which Captain Bloye\r\nhad mounted on the rocky islet of Santa Anna outside the harbour. On\r\nthe 7th fire was begun from two batteries against the mediaeval curtain\r\nwall, but was ineffective--one battery was silenced by the British. On\r\nthe 10th, however, the third battery--much closer in--was ready, and\r\nopened with devastating results on the 11th, two hours’ fire making a\r\nbreach 30 feet wide and destroying a large convent behind it.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, Pedro Alvarez, one of Longa’s colonels, had a garrison\r\nof no more than 1,000 men--all like himself from Longa’s regiments of\r\nIberia; he made a resolute defence, kept up a continuous counter-fire,\r\nand prepared to hold the breach. But it was obvious that the old wall\r\nwas no protection from modern artillery, and that Foy could blow down\r\nas much of it as he pleased at leisure. On the afternoon of the 11th\r\npart of the civil population went on board the British ships: the\r\ngovernor made preparations for holding the castle, on the seaside of\r\nthe town projecting into the water, as a last stronghold: but it was\r\nonly protected by the steepness of the rock on which it stood--its\r\nwalls were ruined and worthless. Late in the day the British took\r\noff the heavy gun which they had placed on the islet--it could not\r\nhave been removed after the town had fallen, and the fall was clearly\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nFoy, seeing the curtain-wall continuing to crumble, and a 60-foot\r\nbreach established, resolved to storm that night, and sent in at\r\n7.20 three columns composed of eight French and eight Italian flank\r\ncompanies for the assault--the former to the breach, the latter\r\nto try to escalade a low angle near the Bilbao gate. Both attacks\r\nsucceeded, despite a heavy but ill-aimed fire from the defenders,\r\nand the Spaniards were driven through the town and into the castle,\r\nwhere they maintained themselves. Alvarez had made preparations for\r\nevacuation--while two companies held the steep steps which were the\r\nonly way up to the castle, the rest of the garrison embarked at its\r\nback on the boats of the British squadron. Some were killed in the\r\nwater by the French fire, some drowned, but the large majority got off.\r\nBy three in the morning there were only 100 men left in the castle:\r\nAlvarez had detailed them to throw the guns into the sea, and to fire\r\nthe magazines, both of which duties they accomplished, before the early\r\ndawn. When, by means of ladders, the French made their way into an\r\nembrasure of the defences, some of this desperate band were killed. But\r\nit is surprising to hear that most of them got away by boat from the\r\nsmall jetty at the back of the castle. They probably owed their escape\r\nto the fact that the stormers had spent the night in riotous atrocities\r\nvying with those of Badajoz on a small scale. Instead of finishing off\r\ntheir job by taking the castle, they had spent the night in rape and\r\nplunder in the town[396].\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards declared that the total loss of their garrison was only\r\n100 men, and the statement is borne out by the dispatch of Captain\r\nBloye of the _Lyra_. Foy wrote to Clausel that the whole business had\r\nonly cost him fifty men. The two statements seem equally improbable,\r\nfor the siege had lasted for six days of open trenches, and both sides\r\nhad fought with great resolution[397].\r\n\r\nBut the really important thing to note about this little affair is\r\nthat it absorbed three French divisions for sixteen days in the most\r\ncritical month of 1813. Eleven thousand men were tied down in a remote\r\ncorner of Biscay, before a patched-up mediaeval wall, while Longa was\r\nrunning riot in Alava and breaking the line of communication with\r\nFrance--and (what is more important) while Wellington’s columns were\r\nsilently gliding into place for the great stroke on the Douro. Colonel\r\nAlvarez could boast that his thousand men had served a very useful and\r\nhonourable end during the great campaign. He and they were landed by\r\nCaptain Bloye at Bermeo, and went off over the hills to join Longa: the\r\nmajority of them must have been present at the battle of Vittoria,\r\nsome six weeks after their escape by sea.\r\n\r\nHaving discharged the first duty set him by Clausel, Foy left the\r\nItalians at Castro, to guard the coast and keep up communications\r\nwith Santoña. He sent Sarrut southward to hunt for Longa, by way\r\nof Orduña; but the Spaniard crossed the Ebro and moved into the\r\nprovince of Burgos, evading pursuit. Then, finding that Lamartinière’s\r\ndivision was guarding the great road in this direction, he turned off\r\nnorth-westward, and escaped by Espinosa to the mountains of Santander.\r\nSarrut, having lost him, turned back to Biscay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Foy himself, after retiring to Bilbao to give a few days of\r\nrest to his division, started out again on May 27th for a circular\r\ntour in Biscay. His object was to destroy the three Biscayan volunteer\r\nbattalions which had given his predecessor so much trouble. Two he\r\ndispersed, but could not destroy, and they ultimately got together\r\nagain in somewhat diminished numbers. The third was more unlucky:\r\ncaught between three converging columns near Lequeytio, it was driven\r\nagainst the seashore and nearly annihilated--360 men were taken, 200\r\nkilled, only two companies got off into the hills (May 30th). But to\r\nachieve this result Foy had collected three brigades--5,000 men--who\r\nwould have been better employed that day on the Esla, for Wellington\r\nwas crossing that river at the moment--and where were the infantry of\r\nthe Army of Portugal, who should have stood in his way?\r\n\r\nSo while the British Army was streaming by tens of thousands into the\r\nundefended plains of Leon, Foy and Sarrut were guerrillero-hunting in\r\nBiscay, and Taupin and Barbot had just failed in the great chase after\r\nMina in Aragon and Navarre. Such were the results of the Emperor’s\r\norders for the pacification of the North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of CASTALLA April 13 1813]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXV: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAN EPISODE ON THE EAST COAST. CASTALLA, APRIL 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, from November to February, affairs had been\r\nquiet on the Mediterranean side of the Peninsula. The transient sojourn\r\nof the Armies of Soult and King Joseph in the kingdom of Valencia,\r\nwhich had so much troubled the mind of General Maitland, had lasted no\r\nmore than a few weeks. After they had marched off to retake Madrid, no\r\ntraces remained of them, in the end of October, save the mass of sick,\r\nconvalescents, and Spanish refugees which they had left behind--guests\r\nmost undesired--in charge of Suchet. There was no longer any fear\r\nof a siege of Alicante, or of the expulsion of the Anglo-Sicilian\r\nexpeditionary corps from Spain.\r\n\r\nWhen the shadow of this fear had passed, the Allied forces resumed\r\nsomething like their old position. The Anglo-Sicilians had passed\r\nunder many commanders since the autumn: Maitland had resigned owing to\r\nill-health before October 1st: he was succeeded for six weeks by John\r\nMackenzie, the senior Major-General at Alicante, who was superseded\r\nabout November 20th by William Clinton (brother of Henry Clinton of\r\nthe 6th Division). But Clinton was only in charge of the expeditionary\r\nforce for twelve days, being out-ranked by James Campbell,\r\nAdjutant-General of the Army of Sicily, who turned up with a large body\r\nof reinforcements on December 2nd. Campbell, however, only bore rule\r\nat Alicante for a period of three months, giving place to Sir John\r\nMurray on February 25th. It was therefore on the last-named officer\r\nthat the stress of co-operating with Wellington in the campaign of 1813\r\nwas to fall. The unlucky man was quite unequal to the position, being\r\nsingularly infirm of purpose and liable to lose his head at critical\r\nmoments, as he had shown at Oporto on May 12th, 1809[398]. It is\r\nsurprising that Wellington, knowing his record, should have acquiesced\r\nin the appointment--perhaps he thought that here at least was a\r\ngeneral who would take no risks, and have no dangerous inspirations of\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Alicante army had risen by January 1813 to\r\nsomething like 14,000 men, but it remained (as it had been from the\r\nfirst) a most heterogeneous force, consisting in the early spring of\r\n1813 of six British[399], three German[400], and two foreign battalions\r\nbelonging to the regular forces of the Crown[401], with four Italian\r\nunits[402] of various sorts. The cavalry consisted of one British and\r\none Sicilian regiment and an odd squadron of ‘Foreign Hussars.’ The\r\nartillery was partly British, partly Sicilian, and partly Portuguese.\r\nIn addition to these troops the commander at Alicante had complete\r\ncontrol over General Whittingham’s ‘Majorcan division,’ a Spanish corps\r\nwhich had been reorganized in the Balearic Islands by that officer, and\r\nwhich had been clothed, armed, and paid from the British subsidy. It\r\nconsisted of six infantry battalions and two weak cavalry regiments,\r\nand was in the spring about 4,500 strong. They were rightly esteemed\r\nthe best Spanish troops on the Eastern front, and justified their\r\nreputation in the subsequent campaign. There was a second Spanish\r\ndivision in the neighbourhood, that of General Roche, which, like\r\nWhittingham’s, had been taken on to the British subsidy, and re-clothed\r\nand re-armed. But this unit was not reckoned part of the Alicante\r\nforce, but belonged theoretically to Elio’s Murcian army, in which\r\nit was numbered as the 4th Division. It counted only five battalions\r\nand was at this time not more than 3,500 strong. But though it was\r\nregistered as part of the Army of Murcia, it often acted with Murray’s\r\nAnglo-Sicilian troops, being cantoned alongside of them in the Alicante\r\nregion. When Wellington became Generalissimo of the Spanish armies,\r\nhe not infrequently gave orders to Roche to join Murray rather than\r\nElio--apparently conceiving that the fact that the division lived on\r\nthe British subsidy had placed it on a somewhat different footing from\r\nthe rest of the Murcians.\r\n\r\nIf we count Whittingham and Roche as attached to the Expeditionary\r\nArmy at Alicante, the strength of that heterogeneous host would have\r\nbeen rather over 21,000 men--a total perceptibly greater than Suchet’s\r\nfield-force encamped over against it on the Xucar. And in addition\r\nthere lay close behind, within the borders of the kingdom of Murcia,\r\nElio and his ‘Second Army,’ which, even after deducting Roche’s\r\ndivision, was a considerable accumulation of troops. But the Murcian\r\narmy’s record was more unhappy than that of any other Spanish unit, and\r\nit had been dashed to pieces once more in the preceding July, at the\r\ndiscreditable battle of Castalla. Though it nominally counted 30,000\r\nmen in its six divisions, only three of them were available[403],\r\nfor two were really no more than the old guerrillero bands of the\r\nEmpecinado and Duran, who hung about in Southern Aragon, and shifted\r\nfor themselves. They were both remote and disorganized. Since Roche’s\r\ndivision was also often out of Elio’s control, he really had no more\r\nthan 13,000 infantry and 2,000 horse in hand.\r\n\r\nThere were facing Suchet, of allied troops of one sort and another,\r\nsome 35,000 men, a fact which the Marshal never ceased to utilize in\r\nhis correspondence with Madrid, when he wished to excuse himself from\r\nlending aid to his neighbours. But the Murcian army had still not\r\nrecovered from the demoralization caused by the battle of Castalla, and\r\nthe Alicante army was suffering from two evils which reduced its value\r\nas a campaigning force to a very low level. The first was a terrible\r\ndeficiency of transport. When Lord William Bentinck sent out the\r\nfirst expeditionary force from Sicily, he intended it to equip itself\r\nwith mules, horses, and carts in Spain. But in the summer of 1812 the\r\nKingdom of Murcia was the only unoccupied region on the east side of\r\nthe Peninsula, and all its not too copious resources were wanted for\r\nits own army. Successive captains-general refused, not unnaturally, to\r\nhelp Maitland or Murray in the task of collecting sumpter-beasts, and\r\nsuggested that they ought to draw both animals and food from Sicily.\r\nFood was indeed procured from thence, and even from Algeria and the\r\nLevant, so that the army did not starve. But there was insufficient\r\nmeans to move that food from the water’s edge. A certain number of\r\nmules were collected by paying very heavy hire--not at all to the\r\ngratification of the Spanish authorities, who wanted them for their\r\nown use. But they were so few that the Army could make no long general\r\nmarches, and could count on little more than what the men carried in\r\ntheir haversacks. The best that could be done was to move it forward\r\nfrom the immediate neighbourhood of Alicante, so that it could live\r\nupon the resources of the inland, where there were many fertile and\r\nwell-peopled valleys. The main object, indeed, of James Campbell’s\r\nforward move was to get food for Whittingham’s and Roche’s divisions,\r\nwhich were (though paid by the British subsidy) dependent for their\r\nrations on the Spanish Government, and seldom received them. Local\r\nfood for these troops had to be sought, as the only possible means\r\nof keeping them alive. In February the line of occupation reached\r\nas far as Biar, Castalla, and Xixona, all held by Whittingham’s\r\ndivision, while Roche and the Anglo-Sicilians were mostly in second\r\nline, at Elda, Monforte, and Alicante. But the problem of making the\r\nAnglo-Sicilian army a mobile force was not much further advanced in\r\nMarch 1813 than it had been in October 1812.\r\n\r\nThe second weak point of the Alicante army was the extremely doubtful\r\nquality of some of its foreign elements. It is true that the German\r\nLegion battalions were as steady as those of the same corps in\r\nWellington’s own army. But all the others were crammed with deserters\r\nfrom the enemy’s ranks, or prisoners of war who had enlisted in\r\norder to escape the miseries of the prison-camp or the hulks. The\r\n‘Calabrese Free Corps’ was a trifle better than the rest, being mostly\r\ncomposed of genuine exiles. But the only difference between the recent\r\nrecruits of Dillon’s cosmopolitan regiment in the British service\r\nand of the ‘Italian Levy’ and ‘Estero regiment’ was that the former\r\ncorps contained more French and Swiss deserters, and the latter pair\r\nmore Italians. All had the usual sprinkling of Poles, Dutch, Croats,\r\nand other miscellaneous adventurers. A lurid light was thrown upon\r\ntheir possibilities on February 11th, when 86 men of the 2nd Italian\r\nLevy deserted to the French lines, bringing over their officer as a\r\nprisoner. It was discovered that the rest of the battalion were in\r\na plot to betray Xixona to Suchet, and with it one of Whittingham’s\r\nSpanish regiments, which was encamped beside them. There was just time\r\nto march in the 1 /27th and a second Spanish battalion, who surrounded\r\nand disarmed the Italians, before a French column appeared at dawn. It\r\ndirected itself to the quarters from which the traitors had just been\r\ndrawn off, was surprised to be received with a heavy fire, and rapidly\r\nwithdrew [404]. Such an incident was certainly not calculated to\r\ninspire a timid general, like Sir John Murray, with any great craving\r\nfor a bold offensive.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Murray had a formidable force on paper, and when\r\nSuchet reflected that there lay close behind him, first Elio’s army\r\nin Murcia--at least 13,000 men without counting the Empecinado’s and\r\nDuran’s bands--and farther back Del Parque’s Andalusian ‘3rd Army,’\r\nwhich had also some 13,000 effectives, he could not but see that 50,000\r\nmen might march against his comparatively weak force in Valencia at\r\nany moment. His strength on the Xucar was very modest--not much over\r\n15,000 bayonets and sabres: for though he had 60,000 men of all arms\r\neffective, and 75,000 on his rolls, including sick and detached, yet\r\nsuch a force was not enough to control the whole of the ancient lands\r\nof the Aragonese crown--Aragon Proper, Catalonia, and Valencia. He\r\nwas in possession of all of them save the Catalan inland, where the\r\n‘First Army’ still maintained itself, the extreme southern region of\r\nthe Valencian kingdom round Alicante, and the mountains between Aragon\r\nand Castile, which were the hunting ground of the guerrilleros of\r\nDuran and the Empecinado. The garrison was small for such a widespread\r\noccupation, and the only thing that made the Marshal’s position\r\ntolerable was the fact that (unlike Catalonia) Aragon and Valencia had\r\nshown themselves very ‘quiet’ regions. Suchet’s rule had been severe,\r\nbut at least orderly; there had been little of the casual plunder and\r\nrequisitioning which made French rule detested under other commanders.\r\nThe coast-plain of Valencia and the broad stretch of the Ebro valley\r\nin Central Aragon were districts less suitable for the operations of\r\nguerrilleros than almost any other part of Spain. On the Valencian\r\nfrontier there was only one active _partida_, that of the ‘Fraile’\r\n(Agostin Nebot), whose welcome gift of 60 captured French transport\r\nmules to the Alicante army is acknowledged in one of Wellington’s\r\ndispatches. It is true that the sub-Pyrenean parts of Aragon were\r\nexposed to Mina’s raids, and that the solid block of sierras round\r\nMolina and Albaracin was always the refuge of Duran and Villacampa, but\r\nthese were not essential regions for the maintenance of the hold on\r\nthe Mediterranean coast. With the exception of these tracts the land\r\nwas fairly quiet: there was a general submission to the French yoke,\r\nand an appreciable proportion of _afrancesados_. The blow inflicted\r\non public opinion by the fall of Valencia in January 1812 was still\r\na recent thing. Wellington’s army had been heard of, but never seen;\r\nand the operations of the Alicante expeditionary force had hitherto\r\nserved to depress rather than to encourage insurrection. Hence it was\r\npossible that 35,000 men could hold the broad lands that lay between\r\nTudela and Saragossa and Lerida on the North, and Denia and Xativa on\r\nthe South--though Decaen’s 28,000 had a much more precarious grip on\r\nCatalonia. But the occupation was a _tour de force_ after all, and\r\nwas liable to be upset at any moment by an active and capable enemy.\r\nFortunately for Suchet his opponent on the East Coast during the spring\r\nof 1813 was neither active nor capable.\r\n\r\nAs long as King Joseph kept his head-quarters at Madrid and occupied\r\nthe province of La Mancha, extending his line eastward to San Clemente,\r\nhe had been in touch with Suchet’s front, and communications were open.\r\nIndeed Daricau’s division marched to the borders of Valencia in the end\r\nof January, and took over from the Marshal the large body of Spanish\r\nrefugees and convalescents of the Army of the South, who had been under\r\nhis charge since October. But the whole situation was changed when the\r\norders of the Emperor compelled Joseph to draw back his head-quarters\r\nto Valladolid, and to hold Toledo as his extreme post towards the\r\nSouth. When this change was made, the touch between Valencia and Madrid\r\nwas lost--the Spanish cavalry of the Army of Andalusia advanced across\r\nthe Sierra Morena into La Mancha: Villacampa’s division descended from\r\nthe hills to occupy the more level parts of the province of Cuenca. For\r\nthe future the King and Suchet could only keep touch with each other\r\nby the circuitous route through Saragossa. The situation of the French\r\nArmy of Valencia was rendered far more isolated and dangerous--it was\r\nin a very advanced position, with no communication whatever with any\r\nfriendly force save through Aragon. And its inland flank was exposed\r\nto all manner of possible molestation--if Villacampa, Duran, and the\r\nEmpecinado had represented a serious fighting force, capable of regular\r\naction in the field, Suchet would have been bound to retire at once to\r\nthe line of the Ebro, on pain of finding himself surrounded and cut\r\noff. But these irregular ‘divisions’ of the Army of Murcia were, as\r\na matter of fact, good for raids and the cutting of communications,\r\nbut useless for battle. They were local in their operations, seldom\r\ncombined, and only obeyed their nominal commander, Elio, when it\r\npleased them. It was very hard for any one of them to move far from its\r\naccustomed ‘beat,’ because they had no magazines, and lived each on\r\ntheir own region.\r\n\r\nSuchet accordingly resolved to try the hazardous experiment of\r\npreserving his old positions, even when communication with Madrid had\r\nbeen cut off. He left on his inland flank only a flying brigade or\r\ntwo, and the normal garrisons of the small fortified towns of upper\r\nAragon, and kept his main striking force still concentrated on the\r\nline of the Xucar, in order to cover the plain of Valencia from the\r\none serious enemy, the Alicante army. The available troops consisted\r\nof the three small infantry divisions of Habert, Harispe, and Musnier\r\n(this last temporarily under Robert), and the cavalry division of\r\nBoussard, the whole amounting to about 12,500 foot and 1,500 horse,\r\nor a gross total of all arms of some 15,000 men. They were disposed\r\nso as to cover the front of 50 miles from Moxente, at the foot of the\r\nMurcian mountains, to the mouth of the Xucar, and were not scattered\r\nin small parties, but concentrated in four groups which could easily\r\nunite. The right wing was covered by an entrenched camp at Moxente, the\r\ncentre by another at San Felipe de Xativa. Denia on the sea-coast was\r\nheld as a cover to the left wing. Cavalry was out in front, and in a\r\nrather exposed position a brigade of Habert’s division held Alcoy, a\r\nconsiderable town in a fertile upland valley, whose resources Suchet\r\nwas anxious to retain as long as possible.\r\n\r\nSoon after he had taken over command at Alicante on February 25th,\r\nMurray obtained accurate local information as to the exact distribution\r\nand numbers of the French, and noting the very exposed position of\r\nthe brigade at Alcoy, made an attempt to cut it off by the concentric\r\nadvance of four columns. The scheme failed, partly because of the late\r\narrival of the right-hand column (a brigade of Whittingham’s division),\r\npartly because Murray, having got engaged with the French in front,\r\nrefused to support his advanced troops until the flanking detachments\r\nshould appear, and so allowed the enemy to slip away (March 6th)[405].\r\nHe then halted, though his movement must obviously have roused Suchet’s\r\nattention, and rendered a counter-attack possible. But after a week,\r\nfinding the enemy still passive, he sent forward Whittingham to drive\r\nthe French outposts from Consentaina, and the pass of Albeyda, in the\r\nmountain range which separates the valley of Alcoy from the lowland.\r\nThis was to ask for trouble, and should only have been done if Murray\r\nwas proposing to challenge Suchet to a decisive general action:\r\nWhittingham indeed thought that this was the object of his commanding\r\nofficer[406]. At the same time two British battalions under General\r\nDonkin made a demonstration against the French right, ten miles farther\r\neast, in the direction of Onteniente. Habert, whose whole division was\r\nholding the line of hills, gave way after a sharp skirmish, and allowed\r\nWhittingham to seize the pass of Albeyda (March 15th). Every one\r\nsupposed that the Alicante army was now about to attack the French main\r\nposition between Moxente and Xativa.\r\n\r\nBut Murray’s plan was different: having, as he supposed, attracted\r\nSuchet’s full notice, by his forward movement, he was proposing to\r\nsend out an expedition by sea, to make a dash at the town of Valencia,\r\nwhich (as he calculated) must be under-garrisoned when heavy fighting\r\nwas expected on the Xucar. He told off for the purpose Roche’s\r\nSpanish division, strengthened by the British provisional battalion\r\nof grenadier companies and a regiment borrowed from Elio. The orders\r\nwere to land on the beach south of the city, make a dash for it, and\r\nif that failed to seize Cullera at the mouth of the Xucar, or Denia,\r\nfarther down the coast. The project looked hazardous, for to throw\r\n5,000 men ashore in the enemy’s country, far from their own main body,\r\nwas to risk their being cut up, or forced to a re-embarkation on a\r\nbare beach, which could not fail to be costly. Unless Murray at the\r\nsame moment attacked Suchet, so that he should not be able to send a\r\nman to the rear towards Valencia, the force embarked was altogether\r\ntoo small. Murray’s calculation was that the Marshal would make a\r\nheavy detachment, and that he would then attack the line of the Xucar\r\nhimself. With this object he invited Elio to co-operate, by turning\r\nthe French right on the inland on the side of Almanza. The Spanish\r\nGeneral, though he had been quarrelling with Murray of late, was now\r\nin an obliging frame of mind[407] and so far consented that he brought\r\nup one infantry division to Yecla, a place which would make a good\r\nstarting-point for a flank march round the extreme right of Suchet’s\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for ten days after the combat of Albeyda nothing happened\r\non the main front. Whittingham was still left in an advanced position\r\nnorth of Alcoy, while the rest of the Alicante army was concentrated\r\nat Castalla fifteen miles farther back. The marvel is that Suchet did\r\nnot make a pounce upon the isolated Spanish division pushed up so close\r\nto his front. He had not yet taken the measure of his opponent, whose\r\nfailing (as the whole campaign shows) was to start schemes, and then to\r\nabandon them from irresolution, at the critical moment when a decisive\r\nmove became necessary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on March 26th Roche’s division and the attached British\r\nbattalion were actually embarking at Alicante, for the dash at\r\nValencia, when Murray received a dispatch from Lord William Bentinck\r\nat Palermo, informing him that a political crisis had broken out in\r\nSicily, that civil strife there had become probable, and that he was\r\ntherefore compelled to order the immediate recall of two regiments\r\nof trustworthy troops from Spain. The fact was that the new Sicilian\r\nconstitution, proclaimed as the solution of all discontent in the\r\nisland in 1812, had failed to achieve its purpose. The old King\r\nFerdinand had carried out a sort of mild _coup d’état_, and proclaimed\r\nhis own restoration to absolute power (March 13th, 1813): the\r\nNeapolitan troops who formed the majority of the armed force in the\r\nisland had accepted the position. The Sicilian constitutional party\r\nseemed helpless, and the attitude of the local battalions under their\r\ncontrol was doubtful. Nothing could save the situation but a display of\r\noverpowering force. Wherefore Bentinck directed Murray to send back to\r\nPalermo, without delay, the 6th Line battalion K.G.L. and the battalion\r\nof grenadier companies belonging to British regiments still quartered\r\nin Sicily. This was not a very large order, so far as mere numbers\r\nwent--the force requisitioned being under 2,000 bayonets. But the\r\nprospect of the outbreak of civil war in Sicily scared Murray--if the\r\nstrife once began, would not more of his best troops be requisitioned,\r\nand the Alicante force be reduced to a residuum of disloyal foreign\r\nlevies? Moreover, one of the units requisitioned by name was the\r\nbattalion of grenadiers just about to sail for Valencia. Perhaps not\r\nwithout secret satisfaction, for he hated making decisions of any sort,\r\nMurray declared that Bentinck’s orders rendered the naval expedition\r\nimpossible, and countermanded it. He sent off, on the transports ready\r\nin harbour, the grenadier battalion ordered to Sicily, and returned the\r\nSpanish contingent to its old cantonments[408]. The K.G.L. battalion\r\nwas just embarking when news arrived (April 1st) that the Sicilian\r\ncrisis was now over, wherefore Murray retained it for a few more\r\nday[409].\r\n\r\nFor the counter-revolution at Palermo had only lasted for four days!\r\nFinding Lord William Bentinck firm, and prepared to use force, King\r\nFerdinand withdrew his proclamation, and resigned the administration\r\ninto the hands of his eldest son, the Prince Royal. The Queen, whose\r\nstrong will had set the whole affair on foot, promised to return to\r\nher native Austria, and actually sailed for the Levant, to the intense\r\nsatisfaction of every one save the knot of intriguers in her Court. The\r\nscare was soon over--its only result was the abandonment of the raid\r\non Valencia. Murray had now received orders from Wellington to await\r\nthe arrival of a detailed scheme for the way in which his army was to\r\nbe employed. Pending the receipt of these[410] directions he lapsed\r\ninto absolute torpidity--the only record of his doings in the last days\r\nof March and early April being that he set the troops concentrated\r\nat Castalla to entrenching the hillsides around that formidable\r\nposition--a clear sign that he had no further intention of taking the\r\noffensive on his own account.\r\n\r\nSuchet had been much puzzled by the advance of his enemy to Alcoy and\r\nAlbeyda, followed by subsequent inactivity for a whole month. When\r\nhe found that even the movement of Elio’s troops to Yecla did not\r\nforeshadow a general assault upon his lines, he concluded that there\r\nmust be some unexplained reason for the quiescence of the Allies,\r\nand that the opportunity was a good one for a bold blow, while they\r\nremained inexplicably waiting in a disjointed and unconcentrated line\r\nopposite his positions. The obvious and easy thing would have been to\r\nfall upon Whittingham at Alcoy, but probably for that very reason the\r\nMarshal tried another scheme. He secretly passed all his available\r\ntroops to Fuente la Higuera, on his extreme right flank, leaving only a\r\ntrifling screen in front of Murray’s army, and on April 10th marched in\r\ntwo columns against the allied left. One consisting of six battalions\r\nof Harispe’s division and two cavalry regiments aimed at the isolated\r\nMurcian division at Yecla, the other and larger column four battalions\r\nof Habert’s division, and seven of Musnier’s (under Robert during the\r\nabsence of its proper chief), with his cuirassier regiment, marched by\r\nCaudete on Villena, to cut in between the Spaniards and Murray, and\r\nintercept any aid which the latter might send from Castalla towards the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nThe blow was unexpected and delivered with great vigour: Harispe\r\nsurprised General Mijares’ Murcians at Yecla at dawn; they were\r\nhopelessly outnumbered, only four battalions being present-the fifth\r\nunit of the division was at Villena. And there was but a single\r\nsquadron with them, Elio’s cavalry being in its cantonments thirty\r\nmiles away in the Albacete-Chinchilla country. Mijares, on finding\r\nhimself assailed by superior numbers, tried to march off towards\r\nJumilla and the mountains. Harispe pursued, and seeing the Spaniards\r\nlikely to get away, for the retreat was rapid and in good order, flung\r\nhis hussars and dragoons at them. The Spaniards turned up on to a\r\nhillside, and tried a running fight. The two leading battalions of the\r\ncolumn made good their escape--the two rear battalions were cut off:\r\nthey formed square, beat back two charges with resolution, but were\r\nbroken by the third, and absolutely exterminated: 400 were cut down,\r\nabout 1,000 captured. Of these two unlucky regiments, 1st of Burgos\r\nand Cadiz, hardly a man got away--the other two, Jaen and Cuenca, took\r\nlittle harm[411]. The French lost only 18 killed and 61 wounded, mostly\r\nin the two cavalry regiments, for Harispe’s infantry were but slightly\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nIll news flies quickly--the fighting had been in the early dawn, by\r\nnoon mounted fugitives had brought the tidings to Villena, fifteen\r\nmiles away. Here there chanced to be present both Elio and Sir John\r\nMurray, who had ridden over to consult with his colleague on a rumour\r\nthat Suchet was concentrating at Fuente la Higuera. He had brought with\r\nhim the ‘light brigade,’ under Colonel Adam, which he had recently\r\norganized[412], and 400 horse[413]. The Generals soon learned that\r\nbeside the force which had cut up Mijares, there was a larger column\r\nmarching on their own position. They were in no condition to offer\r\nbattle, Elio having with him only a single battalion, Murray about\r\n2,500 men of all arms. They agreed that they must quit Villena and\r\nconcentrate their troops for a defensive action. Elio sent orders to\r\nhis cavalry to come in from the North and join the wrecks of Mijares’\r\ndivision, and for the reserves which he had got in the neighbourhood\r\nof Murcia to march up to the front[414]. But it would obviously take\r\nsome days to collect these scattered items. Meanwhile he threw the\r\nsingle battalion that he had with him (Velez Malaga) into the castle\r\nof Villena, which had been patched up and put into a state of defence,\r\npromising that it should be relieved when his army was concentrated.\r\n\r\nMurray, on the other hand, retired towards his main body at Castalla,\r\nbut ordered Adam’s ‘light brigade’ to defend the pass of Biar for as\r\nlong as prudence permitted, so as to allow the rest of the army to\r\nget into position. Whittingham was directed to fall back from Alcoy,\r\nRoche to come up from the rear, and by the next evening the whole\r\nAlicante army would be concentrated, in a position which had been\r\npartly entrenched during the last three weeks, and was very strong even\r\nwithout fortification. Murray refused (very wisely) to send back Adam\r\nto pick up the Spanish battalion left in Villena, which Elio (seized\r\nwith doubts when it was too late) now wished to withdraw.\r\n\r\nSuchet reached Villena on the evening of the 11th, and got in touch\r\nwith the cavalry screen covering Adam’s retreat. Finding the castle\r\nheld, he started to bombard it with his field artillery, and on the\r\nmorning of the 12th blew in its gates and offered to storm. He sent\r\nin a _parlementaire_ to summon the garrison, and to his surprise it\r\ncapitulated without firing a shot--a mutiny having broken out among\r\nthe men[415], who considered that they had been deserted by their\r\nGeneral. Suchet now intended to fall on Murray at Castalla, reckoning\r\nthat Elio’s concentration had been prevented by the blows at Yecla\r\nand Villena, and that he would have the Alicante army alone to deal\r\nwith. He ordered the troops that were with him to drive in without\r\ndelay Adam’s light brigade, which his cavalry had discovered holding\r\nthe village of Biar and the pass above it. His other column, that of\r\nHarispe, was not far off, being on the march from Yecla. Finding that\r\nit was gone, Mijares cautiously reoccupied that place with his two\r\nsurviving battalions.\r\n\r\nThe combat of Biar, which filled the midday hours of April 12th, was\r\none of the most creditable rearguard actions fought during the whole\r\nPeninsular War. Colonel Adam had only one British and two Italian\r\nbattalions, with two German Legion rifle companies, four mountain guns,\r\nand one squadron of the ‘Foreign Hussars’--about 2,200 men in all.\r\nHe had prepared a series of positions on which he intended to fall\r\nback in succession, as each was forced. At the commencement of the\r\naction he occupied Biar village with the Calabrese Free Corps, flanked\r\nby the light companies of the 2/27th and 3rd K.G.L. The rest of the\r\nbrigade was above, on the hills flanking the pass, with the guns on\r\nthe high road. The leading French battalion assaulted the barricaded\r\nvillage, and was repulsed with heavy loss. Then, as was expected, the\r\nenemy turned Biar on both flanks: its garrison retired unharmed, but\r\nthe turning columns came under the accurate fire of the troops on the\r\nslopes above, and the attack was again checked. Suchet, angered at\r\nthe waste of time, then threw in no less than nine battalions[416]\r\nintending to sweep away all opposition, and turning Adam’s left flank\r\nwith swarms of voltigeurs. The Light Brigade had, of course, to retire;\r\nbut Adam conducted his retreat with great deliberation and in perfect\r\norder, fending off the turning attack with his German and British light\r\ncompanies, and making the column on the high road pay very dearly for\r\neach furlong gained. His four mountain guns, on the crest of the pass,\r\nwere worked with good effect to the last moment--two which had each\r\nlost a wheel were abandoned on the ground. When the crest had been\r\npassed, Suchet sent a squadron of cuirassiers to charge down the road\r\non the retreating infantry. Foreseeing this, when the cavalry had been\r\nnoted on the ascent, Adam had hidden three companies of the 2/27th\r\nin rocks where the road made a sharp angle: the cuirassiers, as they\r\ntrotted past, received a flank volley at ten paces distance, which\r\nknocked over many, and sent the rest reeling back in disorder on to\r\ntheir own infantry. After this the pursuit slackened; ‘the enemy seemed\r\nglad to be rid of us,’ and after five hours’ fighting the Light Brigade\r\nmarched back in perfect order to the position beside Castalla which had\r\nbeen assigned to it[417]. Its final retirement was covered by three\r\nbattalions which Murray had sent out to meet it, at the exit from the\r\npass[418].\r\n\r\nSo ended a very pretty fight. Whittingham, who had witnessed the later\r\nphases of it from the hill on the left of Castalla, describes it as\r\n‘a beautiful field-day, by alternate battalions: the volleys were\r\nadmirable, and the successive passage of several ravines conducted\r\nwith perfect order and steadiness. From the heights occupied by my\r\ntroops it was one of the most delightful panoramas that I ever beheld.’\r\nThe allied loss was about 300[419], including Colonel Adam wounded\r\nin the arm, yet not so much hurt but that he kept the command and\r\ngave directions to the end. On the ground evacuated 41 ‘missing’ and\r\ntwo disabled mountain guns were left in the enemy’s hands. The French\r\nmust have suffered much the same casualties--Suchet gives no estimate,\r\nbut Martinien’s invaluable lists show two officers killed and twelve\r\nwounded, which at the usual rate between officers and men implies about\r\n300 rank and file hit.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the pass of Biar in the late afternoon Suchet could\r\nsee Murray’s army occupying a long front of high ground as far as the\r\ntown of Castalla, but could descry neither its encampment, behind the\r\nheights, nor the end of its right wing, which was thrown back and\r\nhidden by the high conical hill on which the castle and church of\r\nCastalla stand. Seeing the enemy ready, and apparently resolved to\r\nfight, the Marshal put off serious operations to the next day. He had\r\nto wait for Harispe’s column, which was still coming up many miles in\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\nMurray had long surveyed his ground, and had (as we have seen) thrown\r\nup barricades and entrenchments on the hill of Castalla and the ground\r\nimmediately to its right and left. He had very nearly every available\r\nman of his army in hand, only a minimum garrison having been left in\r\nAlicante[420]. The total cannot have been less than 18,000 men; he\r\nhad divided his own troops into the Light Brigade of Adam, and the\r\ntwo divisions of Mackenzie and Clinton. The first named had three\r\nand a quarter battalions--not quite 2,000 men after its losses at\r\nBiar on the previous afternoon[421]. Mackenzie seems to have had one\r\nBritish, two German Legion, and two Sicilian battalions[422]: Clinton\r\nthree British, one composite Foreign, and one Italian battalion[423].\r\nWhittingham had six Spanish battalions with him[424]--Roche only\r\nfive[425]. The cavalry consisted of three squadrons of the 20th Light\r\nDragoons, two of Sicilian cavalry, one of ‘Foreign Hussars,’ and about\r\n400 of Whittingham’s Spanish horse[426], under 1,000 sabres in all.\r\nThere were two British, two Portuguese, and a Sicilian battery on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe sierra on the left, known as the heights of Guerra, was held by\r\nWhittingham’s Spaniards for a mile, next them came Adam’s brigade,\r\nabove a jutting spur which projects from the sierra towards the plain,\r\nthen Mackenzie’s division, which extended as far as the hill on which\r\nthe castle of Castalla stands: this was occupied by the 1/58th of\r\nClinton’s division, and two batteries had been thrown up on the slope.\r\nWith this hill the sierra ends suddenly; but a depression and stream\r\nrunning southward furnished a good protection for Murray’s right, which\r\nwas held by the rest of Clinton’s division. The stream had been dammed\r\nup, and formed a broad morass covering a considerable portion of the\r\nfront. Behind it Clinton’s troops were deployed, with three of Roche’s\r\nbattalions as a reserve in their rear: two batteries were placed on\r\ncommanding knolls in this part of the line, which was so far thrown\r\nback _en potence_ that it was almost at right angles to the front\r\noccupied by Mackenzie, Adam, and Whittingham. The Spanish and Sicilian\r\ncavalry was thrown out as a screen in front of Castalla, with two of\r\nRoche’s battalions in support. The 20th Light Dragoons were in reserve\r\nbehind the town. The east end of the sierra, near Castalla, was covered\r\nby vineyards in step-cultivation, each enclosure a few feet higher\r\nthan the next below it. Farther west there was only rough hillside,\r\nbelow Whittingham’s front. The whole position was excellent--yet\r\nMurray is said by his Quartermaster-General, Donkin, to have felt so\r\nuncomfortable that he thrice contemplated issuing orders for a retreat,\r\nthough he could see the whole French army, and judge that its strength\r\nwas much less than his own[427]. But he distrusted both himself and\r\nmany battalions of his miscellaneous army.\r\n\r\nSuchet, contrary to his wont, was slow to act. It is said that he\r\ndisliked the look of the position, and doubted the wisdom of attacking,\r\nbut was over-persuaded by some of his generals, who urged that the\r\nenemy was a mixed multitude, and that the Spaniards and Sicilians would\r\nnever stand against a resolute attack. It was not till noon that the\r\nFrench army moved--the first manœuvre was that the whole of the cavalry\r\nrode out eastward, took position opposite the angle _en potence_ of\r\nMurray’s position, and sent exploring parties towards Clinton’s front.\r\nEvidently the report was that it was inaccessible. While this was\r\nhappening the infantry deployed, and Habert’s and Robert’s division\r\nadvanced and occupied a low ridge, called the Cerro del Doncel, in the\r\nplain facing Murray’s left and left-centre. Harispe’s division, minus\r\na detachment left behind the pass of Biar to watch for any possible\r\nappearance of Elio’s troops on the road from Sax, formed in reserve.\r\nThe whole of Suchet’s infantry was only 18 battalions, individually\r\nweaker than Murray’s 24; he was outnumbered in guns also--24 to 30\r\napparently--but his 1,250 cavalry were superior in numbers and quality\r\nto Murray’s. He had certainly not more than 13,000 men on the ground to\r\nthe Allies’ 18,000.\r\n\r\nHis game was to leave Clinton’s division and Castalla alone, watched\r\nonly by his cavalry; to contain Mackenzie by demonstrations, which were\r\nnot to be pushed home; but to strike heavily with Robert’s division\r\nat the Spaniards on the left. If he could break down Whittingham’s\r\ndefence, and drive him off the sierra, he would attack the allied\r\ncentre from flank and front alike--but meanwhile it was not to be\r\npressed. When, therefore, Habert faced Mackenzie nothing serious\r\nhappened, the French sent out swarms of tirailleurs, brought up eight\r\nguns and shelled the position with grape. Mackenzie’s light companies\r\nand guns replied, ‘but there was nothing more than a skirmish: the\r\ncolumns shifted their ground indeed more than once, but they did not\r\ndeploy, and their officers took good care not to bring them under the\r\nfire of our line[428].’\r\n\r\nOn the left, however, there was hard fighting. Suchet first sent out\r\nfive light companies to endeavour to turn the extreme western end of\r\nWhittingham’s line, and, when they were far up the slope, delivered a\r\nfrontal attack on the heights of Guerra with six battalions of Robert’s\r\ndivision: the 3rd Léger and 114th and 121st Line[429]: of these the\r\nleft-hand battalions (belonging to the 121st) came up the projecting\r\nspur mentioned above, and faced the 2/27th on the left of Adam’s\r\nbrigade. The other four were opposed to the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nWhittingham was caught in a rather dangerous position, for a little\r\nwhile before the attack developed, he had received an order from\r\nhead-quarters bidding him execute against Robert’s division precisely\r\nthe same manœuvre that Suchet was trying against himself, viz. to\r\nsend troops to outflank the extreme French right. He was told by the\r\nbearer of the orders, a Sicilian colonel, that this was preliminary\r\nto a general attack downhill upon the French line, which Murray was\r\nintending to carry out. The Spanish division was to turn its flank,\r\nwhile Adam and Mackenzie went straight at its front. There is some\r\nmystery here--Murray afterwards denied to Whittingham that he had given\r\nany such order[430], and Donkin, his Chief of the Staff, maintained\r\nthat his general was thinking of a retreat all that morning rather than\r\nof an attack. Yet Colonel Catanelli was a respectable officer, who was\r\nthanked in dispatches both by Murray and Whittingham for his services!\r\nThree hypotheses suggest themselves: (1) that Murray at one moment\r\nmeditated an attack, because he saw Suchet holding back, and then (with\r\nhis usual infirmity of purpose) dropped the idea, and denied having\r\nmade any such plan to Whittingham, whose position had been gravely\r\nimperilled by its execution. This is quite in accordance with his\r\nmentality, and he often tampered with the truth--as we shall see when\r\ntelling the tale of Tarragona. (2) That Donkin and the head-quarters\r\nstaff, enraged with Murray’s timidity, were resolved to commit him to\r\na fight, and gave unauthorized orders which must bring it on. (3) That\r\nCatanelli, from lack of a good command of English, misunderstood the\r\nGeneral’s language, and gave complete misdirections to Whittingham. I\r\nmust confess that I incline to the first solution[431].\r\n\r\nWhatever the source of these orders may have been, Whittingham began to\r\ncarry them out, though they seemed to him very ill-advised. But noting\r\nthat if he completely evacuated the heights of Guerra there would be\r\na broad gap in the allied line, he left his picquets in position and\r\ntwo battalions on the crest of the hill[432], with another in support\r\nbehind[433], while with the remaining three[434] he moved off to the\r\nleft. The march was executed, out of sight of the enemy, by a mountain\r\npath which ran along the rear of the heights.\r\n\r\nWhittingham had been moving for some half an hour, and slowly, for the\r\npath was steep and narrow, when the sound of musketry on the other side\r\nof the crest reached his ears, and soon after a message that the enemy\r\nwas attacking the whole of the front of his old position. On its left\r\nthe voltigeur companies had got very near the top of the hill--farther\r\neast the assault was only developing. It was lucky that the marching\r\ncolumn had not gone far--Whittingham was able to send his hindmost\r\nbattalion straight up the hill against the voltigeurs, to strengthen\r\nhis flank--with the other two he counter-marched to the rear of the\r\nheights of Guerra, and fed the fighting line which he had left there,\r\nas each point needed succour.\r\n\r\nThe contest all along the heights was protracted and fierce. At\r\nseveral points the French reached the crest, but were never able to\r\nmaintain themselves there, as Whittingham had always a reserve of a\r\nfew companies ready for a counter-stroke. The troops of the Army of\r\nAragon had never before met with such opposition from Spaniards, and\r\nfor a long time refused to own themselves beaten. There was still one\r\nregiment of Robert’s division in reserve[435], but evidently Suchet\r\nshrank from committing the last fraction of his right wing to the\r\nattack, which was obviously not making any decisive headway.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the easternmost column of the French advance suffered a\r\ncomplete defeat: this body, composed of two battalions of the 121st\r\nregiment, had mounted the heights, not at their steepest, but at the\r\npoint where a long projecting spur falls down from them into the plain.\r\nBut even so there was a sudden rise in the last stage of the ascent,\r\nbefore the crest was reached. On coming to it the French colonel\r\n(Millet by name) began to deploy his leading companies, which found\r\nthemselves opposite the 2/27th, on the left of Adam’s brigade. This\r\nmanœuvre had always failed when tried against British infantry--notably\r\nat Albuera, for deployment at close quarters under the deadly fire of\r\na British line was impracticable, and always led to confusion. There\r\nwas a pause[436], many casualties, and much wavering; then, seeing the\r\nenemy stationary and discouraged, Colonel Reeves flung his battalion at\r\nthem in a downhill bayonet charge--like Craufurd at Bussaco. The effect\r\nwas instantaneous and conclusive--the French column broke and raced\r\nheadlong down the slopes, arriving in the valley as a disorganized mob.\r\nIt had lost 19 officers and probably 350 men in five minutes.\r\n\r\nEither in consequence of this rout, or by mere chance at the same\r\nmoment[437], the columns which had been assailing Whittingham so long\r\nand ineffectively, also recoiled in disorder before a charge of the\r\nlast four companies of the Spanish reserve. The whole of the French\r\nright wing had suffered complete and disastrous defeat. The left\r\ndivision, Habert’s, was still intact and had never committed itself\r\nto any serious approach to Mackenzie’s front. But six of the eighteen\r\nFrench battalions in the field were in absolute rout at half-past four\r\no’clock, and Suchet’s right wing was completely exposed--his cavalry\r\nwere two miles away to the left, and out of reach for the moment. All\r\neye-witnesses agree that if Murray had ordered an immediate general\r\nadvance of the line from Castalla westward, the Marshal would have been\r\nlost, and cut off from his sole line of retreat on the pass of Biar.\r\nMurray, however, refused to move till he had brought up his unengaged\r\nright wing to act as a reserve, and only when they had filed up through\r\nthe streets of Castalla, gave the order for the whole army to descend\r\nfrom the heights and push forward.\r\n\r\nIt was far too late: Suchet had retreated from the Cerro del Doncel\r\nthe moment that he saw his attack repulsed, Habert’s division and the\r\nguns covering Robert’s routed wing. The cavalry came galloping back\r\nfrom the east, and long before Murray was deployed, Suchet took up a\r\nnew and narrow front covering the entry of the pass of Biar. The only\r\ntouch with his retreating force was kept by Mackenzie, who (contrary\r\nto Murray’s intention) pushed forward with four of his battalions in\r\nfront of the main body, and got engaged with Suchet’s rearguard. He\r\nmight probably have beaten it in upon the disordered troops behind, if\r\nhe had not received stringent orders to draw back and fall in to the\r\ngeneral front of advance. By the time that the whole allied army was\r\ndeployed, the French, save a long line of guns across the mouth of the\r\npass, with infantry on the slopes on each side, had got off. Thereupon,\r\nafter making a feeble demonstration with some light companies against\r\nthe enemy’s left flank, Murray halted for the night. The enemy used the\r\nhours of darkness to make a forced march for Fuente la Higuera, and\r\nwere invisible next day.\r\n\r\nSuchet declared that he had lost no more than 800 men in the three\r\ncombats of Yecla, Biar, and Castalla, an incredible statement, as\r\nthe French casualty rolls show 65 officers killed and wounded on the\r\n11th-12th-13th of April; and such a loss implies 1,300 rank and file\r\nhit--possibly more, certainly not many less. It is certain that his\r\n800 casualties will not suffice even for Castalla alone, where with 47\r\nofficers _hors de combat_ he must have lost more probably 950 than 800\r\nmen. But the 14 officer-casualties at Biar imply another 280 at the\r\nleast, and we know from his own narrative that he lost 4 officers and\r\n80 men in destroying Mijares’ unfortunate battalions at Yecla[438].\r\n\r\nMurray, writing a most magniloquent and insincere dispatch for\r\nWellington’s eye, declared that Suchet had lost 2,500 or even 3,000\r\nmen, and that he had buried 800 French corpses. But Murray had\r\napparently been taking lessons in the school of Soult and Masséna,\r\nthose great manipulators of casualty lists! His dispatch was so absurd\r\nthat Wellington refused to be impressed, and sent on the document\r\nto Lord Bathurst with the most formal request that the attention of\r\nthe Prince Regent should be drawn to the conduct of the General and\r\nhis troops, but no word of praise of his own[439]. The allied loss,\r\nindeed, was so moderate that Murray’s 2,500 French casualties appeared\r\nincredible to every one. After we have deducted the heavy losses to\r\nAdam’s brigade at Biar on the preceding day, we find that Whittingham’s\r\nSpaniards had 233 casualties, Mackenzie’s division 47, Clinton’s\r\nabout 20, Adam’s brigade perhaps 70, the cavalry and artillery 10\r\naltogether--the total making some 400 in all[440].\r\n\r\nHaving discovered that the Alicante army was formidable, if its general\r\nwas not, Suchet was in some fear that he might find himself pursued\r\nand attacked, for the enemy seemed to be concentrating against him.\r\nMurray advanced once more to Alcoy, Elio brought up his reserve\r\ndivision and his cavalry to join the wrecks of Mijares’ column, and\r\nextended himself on Murray’s left. Villacampa, called down from the\r\nhills, appeared on the Upper Guadalaviar on the side of Requeña. But\r\nall this meant nothing--Murray was well satisfied to have won a success\r\ncapable of being well ‘written up’ at Castalla, and covered his want of\r\ninitiative by complaining that he was short of transport, and weakened\r\nin numbers--for after the battle he had sent off the 6th K.G.L. to\r\nSicily, in belated obedience to Bentinck’s old orders. He asked\r\nWellington for more men and more guns, and was given both, for he was\r\ntold that he might draw the 2/67th from the garrison of Cartagena[441],\r\nand was sent a field battery from Portugal. But his true purpose was\r\nnow to wait for the arrival of the promised ‘plan of campaign’ from\r\nFreneda, and thereby to shirk all personal responsibility. Anything was\r\nbetter than to risk a check--or a reprimand from the caustic pen of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nSuchet, then, drew down Pannetier’s brigade from Aragon to strengthen\r\nhis position on the Xucar, and waited, not altogether confidently, for\r\nthe next move on the part of the enemy. But for a month no such move\r\ncame. He had time to recover his equanimity, and to write dispatches\r\nto Paris which described his late campaign as a successful attempt\r\nto check the enemy’s initiative, which had brought him 2,000 Spanish\r\nprisoners at Yecla and Villena, and two British guns at the pass of\r\nBiar. Castalla was represented as a partial attack by light troops,\r\nwhich had been discontinued when the enemy’s full strength had been\r\ndiscovered, and the losses there were unscrupulously minimized. And,\r\nabove all, good cause had been shown that the Army of Aragon and\r\nValencia could not spare one man to help King Joseph in the North.\r\n\r\nBut the ‘plan of campaign’ was on its way, and we shall see how, even\r\nin Murray’s incompetent hands, it gave the Marshal Duke of Albufera\r\nfull employment for May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH TO VITTORIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nGood generals are very properly averse to putting on paper, even for\r\nthe benefit of premiers or war ministers, the plan of their next\r\ncampaign. Points of leakage are so inscrutable, and so hard to detect,\r\nthat the less that is written the better is it for the projected\r\nenterprise. And Wellington was the most reticent of men--even going to\r\nthe length of hiding from his own responsible subordinates intentions\r\nthat they much desired to learn, and of giving orders that seemed\r\neccentric while the secret reason for them was kept concealed. He never\r\nwrote autobiographical memoirs--the idea was repulsive to him--nor\r\nconsented to open up (even to William Napier, who much desired it) his\r\nfull confidence. For the genesis of the plan of the Vittoria Campaign\r\nwe are compelled to rely mainly on the careful collection of hints from\r\nhis contemporary dispatches, supplemented by certain rare confidential\r\nletters, and some _obiter dicta_ of his later years, which may or may\r\nnot have been reproduced with perfect accuracy by admirers like Croker\r\nor Lord Stanhope.\r\n\r\nOne thing is clear--he was conscious of the mistakes of 1812, and was\r\nnot going to see them repeated in 1813. When the Burgos campaign was\r\njust over he wrote two short comments[442] on it, for the benefit\r\nof persons whom he judged capable of appreciating his difficulties.\r\nHe owned up to his errors--he acknowledged four. The first was that\r\nhe had tried to take Burgos by irregular means, without a proper\r\nbattering train: the second that he had under-estimated the strength\r\nof the united French armies of Portugal and the North: the third that\r\nhe had kept his army in two equal halves over-long--Hill should have\r\nbeen called in from Madrid to join the main body much sooner than he\r\nactually was: the fourth and most notable was that he had entrusted a\r\ncrucial part of his plan of campaign to a Spanish general, over whom\r\nhe had no formal authority--Ballasteros, who should have advanced from\r\nAndalusia to distract and hinder Soult. ‘If the game had been well\r\nplayed it would have answered my purpose. Had I any reason to suppose\r\nthat it would be well played? Certainly not. I have never yet known the\r\nSpaniards do _anything_, much less do anything _well_.... But I played\r\na game which _might_ succeed (the only one that _could_ succeed) and\r\npushed it to the last. The parts having failed--as I admit was to be\r\nexpected--I at least made a handsome retreat to the Agueda, with some\r\nlabour and inconvenience but without material loss.’\r\n\r\nThe interest of these confessions is that we find Wellington in his\r\nnext campaign making a clear effort to avoid precisely these four\r\nmistakes. He made elaborate preparations long beforehand for getting up\r\na battering train: he rather over- than under-estimated his adversary’s\r\nnumbers by way of caution: he never divided his army at all during his\r\ngreat advance of May-June 1813; after the first six days it marched in\r\nclose parallel columns all in one mass, till Vittoria had been reached:\r\nand, last but not least, he entrusted no important part of the scheme\r\nto any Spanish general, and indeed used a much smaller proportion of\r\nSpanish troops than he need have done, although he had now become\r\nGeneralissimo of all the allied armies, and could command where he\r\ncould formerly only give advice.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the termination of the Burgos retreat Wellington’s\r\nviews for the future do not seem to have been very optimistic. He wrote\r\nto the Prime Minister that at present he could do nothing against an\r\nenemy whose numbers had proved too great for him to contend with[443].\r\nNext spring he hoped to take the field with a larger force than he had\r\never had before, but unless the Spaniards could display a discipline\r\nand efficiency which it seemed impossible to teach them, he saw no\r\nprospect of ever obliging the French to quit the Peninsula by force of\r\narms. To Lord Bathurst he wrote in much the same terms--the French,\r\nhe thought, would canton their army in Old Castile and wait for the\r\narrival of fresh reinforcements from France.\r\n\r\nBut the whole aspect of affairs was changed when the news of Napoleon’s\r\nRussian _débâcle_ came to hand. It soon became clear that so far from\r\nany French reinforcements coming to Spain, it would be King Joseph who\r\nwould be asked to send reinforcements to Germany. Lord Liverpool’s\r\nletter, enclosing the 29th Bulletin, reached Wellington at Lisbon on\r\nJanuary 18th, and put him in a more cheerful mood. Moreover, he thought\r\nthat his visit to Cadiz to accept the position of Generalissimo had\r\nbeen a success, and that he would get more help out of the Spaniards\r\nnow that he had the formal power of issuing orders to their generals,\r\n‘though I am not sanguine enough to hope that we shall derive much\r\nadvantage from Spanish troops _early_ in the campaign.’ But he intended\r\nto start betimes, ‘and at least to put myself in Fortune’s way[444].’\r\nThe French would be compelled to stand on the defensive; if they\r\ncontinued to hold the immense line that they were still occupying in\r\nJanuary, they must be weak somewhere, and it was impossible that they\r\nshould be reinforced.\r\n\r\nIt is on February 10th[445] that we get the first hint that\r\nWellington’s scheme for the campaign of 1813 was going to be a very\r\nambitious one--aiming not at local successes in Castile, or on\r\nrecovering Madrid, but at driving the French right up to the Pyrenees.\r\nOn that day he wrote to Lord Bathurst to say that ‘the events of the\r\nnext campaign may render it necessary for the army to undertake one or\r\nmore sieges in the North of Spain,’ wherefore he wished certain heavy\r\nguns and munitions to be sent by sea to Corunna, to be at his disposal,\r\nas soon as might be convenient, and twice the quantity of each to be\r\nprepared in England to be shipped when asked for.\r\n\r\nThe mention of ‘one or more sieges in the North of Spain’ for which\r\nguns had better be sent by sea to Corunna, can only mean that\r\nWellington was thinking of Burgos and St. Sebastian--perhaps also of\r\nSantoña and Pampeluna. There were no other fortresses needing the\r\nattention of a heavy battering train in that direction. It is clear\r\nthat, even in February, Wellington’s mind was travelling far afield;\r\nand on June 26th, Vittoria having been now won, he wrote to remind Lord\r\nBathurst of his demand, and to point out that his forecast had come\r\ntrue[446].\r\n\r\nIn March, as was shown in an earlier chapter, Wellington began to get\r\nthe news which proved that the French were making large drafts from\r\nSpain for the new Army of Germany, and that Soult, Caffarelli, and\r\nother generals were summoned to Paris. He knew, a few days later, that\r\nthe enemy was evacuating La Mancha, and that the King was moving his\r\nhead-quarters from Madrid to Valladolid. Everything indicated conscious\r\nweakness on the part of the enemy--it would be well to take instant\r\nadvantage of it: Wellington wrote to his brother on March 28 that he\r\nhoped to start out in force on May 1st[447]--giving no hint where that\r\nforce would be employed. At the same time he expressed his doubt as to\r\nwhether any of the Spanish corps which were to join him could be ready\r\nby that date. But he was depending so much on the sole exertions of the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese army, that the tardiness of the Spaniards would not\r\nput a complete stop to his projected operations. Two other practical\r\nhindrances were a late spring, which made green forage for the horses\r\nharder to procure than it normally was in April, and accidents from\r\nbad roads and bad weather to his pontoon train, which he was secretly\r\nbringing up from the Tagus to the Douro, as it was to play a most\r\nessential part in the commencement of the campaign[448]. These mishaps\r\nappear mere matters of detail, but (as we shall see) there were immense\r\nconsequences depending upon them--the presence of a large pontoon train\r\non the Esla and the Douro, when its normal habitat was on the lower\r\nTagus, was one of the first surprises in the wonderful campaign of\r\nMay-June 1813. Starting from Abrantes in the end of April, it did not\r\nreach Miranda de Douro till the 20th of May[449].\r\n\r\nThe first definite revelation as to what Wellington’s plan was to be,\r\nis contained in a letter to Beresford of April 24th. ‘I propose to\r\nput the troops in motion in the first days of May: my intention is to\r\nmake them cross the Douro, in general within the Portuguese frontier,\r\ncovering the movement of the left by that of the right of the Army\r\ntoward the Tormes, which right shall then cross the Douro, over the\r\npontoons, in such situation as may be convenient. I then propose to\r\nseize Zamora and Toro, which will make all future operations easy to\r\nus[450].’\r\n\r\nHere the first half of the great movement is accurately set forth, just\r\nas it was executed, though owing to the delays spoken of above, the\r\ngeneral orders for the marching out of all the allied divisions were\r\nissued on May 13th instead of on May 1st-2nd. But in all other respects\r\nwe have the exact analysis of the scheme: the ‘Left’--Graham with the\r\nequivalent of six divisions--crossed the Douro far inside Portugal\r\nat various points, and was in and about Braganza and Miranda by May\r\n21st-24th: meanwhile the ‘Right’--Hill with three divisions--moved\r\nforward from the Agueda to the Tormes, attracting the main attention of\r\nthe French between the 20th and the 26th, till it reached Salamanca,\r\nfrom whence it swerved off to the left, and joined Graham’s wing by\r\nthe bridge of Toro, thus establishing the whole army in one mass north\r\nof the Douro, and completely turning the western flank of the entire\r\nFrench front of defence. On May 12 only, three weeks after he had\r\ncommunicated the secret to Beresford, did Wellington divulge it to the\r\nMinisters at home: evidently he dreaded leakage somewhere in London,\r\nsuch as he had discovered in the preceding autumn[451]. For Lord\r\nBathurst’s benefit he descends a little more into detail:\r\n\r\n‘I propose to commence our operations by turning the enemy’s position\r\non the Douro, by passing the left of our army over that river within\r\nthe Portuguese frontier. I should cross the Right in the same manner,\r\nonly that I have been obliged to throw the Right very forward during\r\nthe winter, in order to cover and connect our cantonments, and I could\r\nnot well draw them back without exposing a good deal of country, and\r\nrisking a counter-movement on the part of the enemy. I therefore\r\npropose to strengthen the Right, and move with it myself across the\r\nTormes, and to establish a bridge on the Douro below Zamora. The two\r\nwings of the army will thus be connected, and the enemy’s position on\r\nthe Douro will be turned. The Spanish Army of Galicia will be on the\r\nEsla, to the left of our army, at the same time that our army reaches\r\nthat river.\r\n\r\n‘Having turned the enemy’s position on the Douro, and established\r\nour communications across it, our next operation will depend on\r\ncircumstances. I do not know whether I am now stronger than the enemy,\r\neven including the Army of Galicia. But of this I am very certain, that\r\nI shall never be stronger throughout the campaign, or more efficient,\r\nthan I am now: and the enemy will never be weaker. I cannot have a\r\nbetter opportunity for trying the fate of a battle, which if the enemy\r\nshould be unsuccessful, must oblige him to withdraw entirely. We have\r\nbeen sadly delayed by the pontoon bridge, without which it is obvious\r\nwe can do nothing[452].’\r\n\r\nNeither in the letter to Beresford nor in that to Bathurst\r\ndoes Wellington make a forecast beyond the first stage of his\r\nadvance--obviously it would be impossible to do so till it was seen how\r\nthe French would act. If they should be tempted to fight--say in front\r\nof Valladolid--when their flank was turned, in order to keep their hold\r\non Castile, Wellington would welcome the decisive engagement. But of\r\ncourse they might refuse to fight, as indeed did they. They retired on\r\nBurgos, as we shall see, without taking any risks.\r\n\r\nBut that Wellington already foresaw the possibility of a victorious\r\nmarch to the Pyrenees is, I think, proved not only by his letter of\r\nFebruary 10th concerning the siege of fortresses in Northern Spain,\r\nquoted above, but by similar hints on May 6 concerning the absolute\r\nnecessity for naval co-operation in the North. He asks Lord Bathurst\r\nto insist on the presence of a squadron under an admiral in the Bay of\r\nBiscay, and for careful supervision of the whole coast from Bayonne\r\nto Corunna, which must absolutely stop French enterprise at sea, and\r\n‘simplify arrangements for convoy and naval operations in concert with\r\nthe army during the ensuing campaign[453].’ Taking this in conjunction\r\nwith the letter of February 10, it seems certain that Wellington was\r\nthinking of stores to be landed at Santander, and a battering train to\r\ndestroy San Sebastian--which was to look forward some way! There was,\r\nhowever, a secondary reason for requiring more naval supervision in the\r\nBay of Biscay: American privateers had been putting in an appearance in\r\nthese waters, and had captured several small transports.\r\n\r\nA plan of campaign that contemplated the driving back of the French to\r\nthe Pyrenees must, of course, embrace a good deal more than the mere\r\nreorganization of the Anglo-Portuguese army for a great push north of\r\nthe Douro. There were many minor factors to be taken into consideration\r\nand utilized. First and foremost came the question as to how far the\r\nposition of Generalissimo of the Spanish Armies could be turned to\r\naccount. After his experiences in 1812 Wellington was determined to\r\nentrust to his Allies no crucial part of the operations, whose failure\r\ncould wreck the whole scheme. With his own striking-force he intended\r\nto take only one Spanish army, that which was under the sole Spanish\r\ngeneral whom he could trust for willing co-operation, even though he\r\nknew him to be no great military genius. Castaños had, by his influence\r\nat Cadiz, been nominated as Captain-General alike in Galicia, Castile,\r\nand Estremadura, and all the troops in those provinces now formed part\r\nof the new ‘4th Army.’ They included Morillo’s division, now cantoned\r\nabout Caçeres, Carlos de España’s in the mountains between Ciudad\r\nRodrigo and the pass of Perales, the lancers of Julian Sanchez--now\r\ncounted a brigade of regular cavalry and not a _partida_--on the front\r\nbetween the Agueda and the Douro, and the two Galician divisions of\r\nLosada and Barcena, with their weak attendant cavalry brigade: to\r\nbring this up to strength two extra regiments[454] had filed up the\r\nPortuguese frontier during the winter from Estremadura. All these\r\nwere in touch with the Anglo-Portuguese army, and were intended to\r\nmove with it. They made up 18,000 foot and 3,000 horse. In addition\r\nthere were many other troops theoretically belonging to the 4th Army,\r\nbut at present cut off from it by the intervening zone of French\r\noccupation--viz. Porlier’s division in the Eastern Asturias, and\r\nMendizabal’s irregular forces in Biscay and Cantabria--the troops of\r\nLonga and the Biscayan volunteers with other smaller bands. These\r\nscattered units, which could only come under Wellington’s real control\r\nwhen he should have beaten the French back to the Ebro, might make up\r\n10,000 or 12,000 men. But they could not be counted upon for the first\r\nmonth of the campaign.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Castaños had a number of immovable troops--the garrisons\r\nof Rodrigo and Badajoz, a dépôt of unhorsed cavalry in Estremadura, and\r\na sedentary unit called the ‘Army of Reserve of Galicia,’ consisting\r\nof all the most depleted corps of the old Galician army: its six\r\nbattalions only made up 2,000 men, and it stopped at Vigo or Corunna\r\nall through the year 1813. Two other Galician battalions[455] had been\r\nsent round by sea during the winter, to join the much-tried Army of\r\nCatalonia. This small transference of troops had reached the knowledge\r\nof the French in an exaggerated shape, and caused much speculation at\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\nBeside the 21,000 men of the 4th Army, who marched in the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese line under Castaños’s nephew General Giron[456],\r\nthere was only one other Spanish force which Wellington intended to\r\nemploy in his own operations. This was the so-called ‘Army of Reserve\r\nof Andalusia,’ which had to come up all the way from Seville, and\r\nwas far too late to join in the campaign of Vittoria: it did not get\r\nto the front till July: even later than the Generalissimo expected.\r\nThe origin of this corps was that, when Soult evacuated Andalusia in\r\nSeptember 1812, the best-equipped of the Cadiz garrison troops joined\r\nthe field-army of Ballasteros, and advanced with him to Granada.\r\nThis body was in April 1813 known as the ‘Third Army’ and was now\r\ncommanded by the Duque del Parque, the successor of the cashiered\r\nBallasteros. But the remainder of the Cadiz garrison, which had not\r\ngone to the front, was organized during the winter into a separate\r\nunit, under Henry O’Donnell, the Conde d’Abispal. It was rather a\r\nmiscellaneous assembly--seven of its fourteen battalions having been\r\nregiments which did not march in October 1812 because they were low\r\nin numbers or equipment, and three more newly-raised units, formed to\r\nreplace in the Army List old regiments which had perished in previous\r\ncampaigns. However, they were filled up with recruits, re-clothed and\r\nre-equipped, and Wellington intended to use them with his own army, as\r\n_étape_ and blockade troops. He preferred to take them with him rather\r\nthan the 3rd Army, which was suspected of having many officers who\r\nhad been devoted to Ballasteros, and who had resented the appointment\r\nof the new British generalissimo[457]. Moreover, O’Donnell was in\r\nevery way a better officer than Del Parque, and had a good fighting\r\nreputation, though he was noted as impetuous and quarrelsome. The Army\r\nof Reserve of Andalusia was 14,000 strong, in two infantry divisions\r\nunder Generals Echevari and Creagh and a weak cavalry brigade under\r\nFreire--late second in command of the Murcian army. The slow equipment\r\nof this corps, its late start, and its frequent halts for want of\r\nprovisions, formed a perpetual source of dispute between Wellington and\r\nthe Minister of War at Cadiz. But as it was not destined to form part\r\nof the original striking-force at the opening of the campaign, or to\r\ndischarge any essential duty in the general scheme, its absence was not\r\nmuch felt. When it did appear, after Vittoria, it was usefully employed\r\nin blockading Pampeluna.\r\n\r\nBut in the summer campaign of 1813 it must be remembered that\r\nWellington employed no Spanish troops save the original 21,000\r\nGalicians and Estremadurans under Giron, and Longa’s 4,000 Cantabrians,\r\nwho joined in from the North ten days before Vittoria, and took a\r\ncreditable share in that battle.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be explained how Wellington intended to get an indirect\r\nprofit out of the existence of the other Spanish corps--the re-named\r\nFirst, Second, and Third Armies, as well as out of the Anglo-Sicilian\r\nexpeditionary force at Alicante, whose conduct had given him so many\r\njust causes of complaint during the autumn of 1812.\r\n\r\nAs to the ‘First Army,’ now commanded by General Copons (the\r\ndefender of Tarifa), this gallant remnant of the old Catalan levies\r\ncould not take the field 10,000 strong, was almost destitute of\r\ncavalry and artillery, and had no large town or secure fortress in\r\nits possession[458]. It held, in a rather precarious fashion, a\r\nconsiderable portion of the mountainous inland of Catalonia--the\r\nhead-quarters were usually at Vich--but had no safe communications\r\nwith the sea, or certainty of receiving succours, though it was\r\nintermittently in touch with Captain Codrington’s cruising squadron.\r\nCopons, who took over command in March 1813, though less disliked than\r\nhis arbitrary and ill-tempered predecessor Lacy, was not popular with\r\nthe Catalans. They would have liked to see their local hero, the Baron\r\nde Eroles, who had been in charge of the principality for some months\r\nafter Lacy’s departure, made captain-general[459]. Weak in numbers\r\nas it was, the Army of Catalonia could obviously do no more than\r\ndetain and keep employed General Decaen’s French army of occupation,\r\nwhich had more than double its strength. The garrisons of Barcelona,\r\nTarragona, Figueras, Lerida, and Tortosa absorbed 13,000 of Decaen’s\r\nmen. But he had 15,000 more available for field service, and his\r\nflying columns often put Copons in danger, for the Catalan army had to\r\nscatter its cantonments far and wide in order to live, and a sudden\r\nhostile concentration might easily cut off some fraction of it, when\r\none part was as far north as the Ampurdam and the passes into France,\r\nand another as far east as the Aragonese border[460]. Normally the\r\nCatalans employed themselves in cutting the communications between the\r\ngreat fortresses, with an occasional foray into Roussillon. Wellington\r\nthought that they could not be better employed, and that nothing more\r\ncould be expected of them. He sent them a small reinforcement of 2,000\r\nmen from the suppressed third division of the Army of Galicia, and\r\nurged that munitions should be thrown in from the side of the sea\r\nwhenever possible.\r\n\r\nThere was little to be expected from the exertions of the Catalan\r\narmy, persevering and meritorious though they were. It remained to be\r\nseen, however, whether something could not be done in the Principality\r\nwith external help. Here came in the main problem of the Eastern\r\nCoast: Suchet must be kept employed at all costs, while the main\r\nblow was being delivered by Wellington himself on the other side of\r\nthe Peninsula. Murray’s and Elio’s futile operations of April had\r\naccomplished little: the Marshal, though frightened at first by their\r\nmovements, and though he had suffered the bloody check of Castalla, had\r\nbeen able to preserve his forward position on the Xucar: he retained\r\ncomplete possession of the Valencian coast-land, and his army was\r\nintact as a striking force. If, during the forthcoming campaign north\r\nof the Douro, he chose to draw off his main force towards Aragon, and\r\nto come in to join the King, there was at present nothing on foot\r\nthat could stop him from such a course. Wellington resolved that this\r\npossibility must be averted, by giving the Marshal a problem of his\r\nown, which should absorb all his attention, and keep him from thinking\r\nof his neighbour’s needs. And this was all the more easy because Suchet\r\nwas notoriously a selfish commander, who thought more of his own\r\nviceroyalty and his own military reputation than of the general cause\r\nof France: his intercepted dispatches, of which Wellington had a fair\r\nselection in his file of cyphers, showed that he was always ready to\r\nfind plausible excuses for keeping to his own side of the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe plan which Wellington formulated for the use of Sir John Murray,\r\nin two dispatches dated on the 14th and 16th of April, was one which\r\ndepended entirely on the judicious use of naval power. The British\r\nfleet being completely dominant in the Mediterranean, and Murray having\r\nat his disposition the large squadron of transports which had brought\r\nhis troops from Sicily, it was clearly possible to land as many men\r\nas the transports could carry, at any point on the immensely long\r\ncoast-line of Valencia and Catalonia that might be selected. They would\r\nhave a local superiority on the selected point until the French troops,\r\ndispersed in many garrisons and cantonments, could mass in sufficient\r\nstrength to attack them: and meanwhile the Catalan army would join\r\nMurray. If the French should draw together in overwhelming power, the\r\nexpedition could, if proper precautions were taken, re-embark before\r\nits position became dangerous. The farther north that the landing\r\ntook place, the more inconvenient would it be for Suchet, who would\r\nobviously have to draw on his field army in Valencia for numbers that\r\nwould enable him to deal with the Anglo-Sicilian force. But the moment\r\nthat Suchet should be forced to deplete his field army in the South,\r\nwhich was already too weak for the task set it, the Spaniards could\r\nadvance on the line of the Xucar, and make a dash at Valencia during\r\nthe Marshal’s absence. In order to give them an irresistible numerical\r\npreponderance over the divisions that Suchet might leave behind him,\r\nDel Parque should bring up the Andalusian army to reinforce Elio’s\r\nMurcians. Between them they would have some 30,000 regular troops,\r\nbesides the bands of the Empecinado and Duran, who would operate on the\r\nside of the mountains against the French rear. It would be hard if such\r\nan accumulation of force could not thrust back the thinned line of the\r\nenemy on to and beyond Valencia.\r\n\r\nFinally, the point at which the expeditionary force was to make its\r\nthrust was to be Tarragona, which was known to be in a state of bad\r\nrepair, and thinly garrisoned, while it had also the advantage of being\r\na very isolated post, and remote both from Decaen’s head-quarters at\r\nGerona, and from Suchet’s at Valencia. Moreover, it was conveniently\r\nplaced for communication with the Catalan army, but separated by\r\ndifficult defiles both from Tortosa southward and Barcelona northward,\r\nat which French relieving forces would have to gather.\r\n\r\nIf the whole plan worked, and Tarragona were to fall in a few days, the\r\nCatalan army would once more have a safe debouch to the sea, and the\r\nAllies would gain a foothold such as they had never owned north of the\r\nEbro since 1811, while at the same time Valencia ought to fall into\r\nthe hands of Elio and Del Parque during Suchet’s enforced absence. But\r\nsupposing that Tarragona held out firmly, and Decaen and Suchet united\r\nto relieve it, the expeditionary force could get away unharmed, and\r\nmeanwhile Valencia ought to have been taken. And even if the blow at\r\nValencia failed also, yet at least the whole French army on the East\r\nCoast would be occupied for a month or more, and would certainly not be\r\nable to spare a single man to help King Joseph or Jourdan.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, a long series of blunders, for which Murray was\r\nmainly responsible, though Elio and Del Parque each took his share\r\nin the muddle, prevented all Wellington’s schemes for active profit\r\nfrom coming to a successful end. Nevertheless, the main purpose was\r\nachieved--not a Frenchman from the East Coast took any share in the\r\ncampaign of Vittoria.\r\n\r\nTo descend to details. Murray was directed to ship off every man of the\r\nAlicante army for whom he could find transport, provided that the total\r\nof infantry and artillery embarked should not fall short of 10,000 of\r\nall ranks. He was to take with him both the Anglo-Sicilians and as many\r\nof Whittingham’s Spaniards as could be carried: if the ships sufficed,\r\nhe might take all or some of Roche’s Spaniards also. Less than 10,000\r\nmen must not sail--the force would then be too small to cause Suchet to\r\ndetach troops from Valencia. Elio and Del Parque would remain behind,\r\nwith such (if any) of Roche’s and Whittingham’s battalions as could\r\nnot be shipped. They were to keep quiet, till they should learn that\r\nSuchet had weakened his forces in Valencia. When it became certain that\r\nthe French opposite them were much reduced in numbers, they were to\r\nadvance, always taking care to turn the enemy’s positions rather than\r\nto make frontal attacks upon them.\r\n\r\nIf, which was quite possible, Murray should fail to take Tarragona,\r\nand should find very large French forces gathering around him, such as\r\nhe and Copons could not reasonably hope to hold in check, he was to\r\nre-embark, and bring the Expeditionary Force back to the kingdom of\r\nValencia, landing it at such a point on the coast as should put him in\r\nline with the front reached by Elio and Del Parque in their advance.\r\n\r\nThere was a subsidiary set of directions for a policy to be\r\ncarried out if the transports available at Alicante should be found\r\ninsufficient to move so many as 10,000 men. But as the shipping\r\nproved enough to carry 14,000, these directions have only an academic\r\ninterest. In this case Murray and Elio were to threaten the line\r\nof the Xucar frontally, while Del Parque turned it on the side of\r\nthe mountains of the interior. Duran and Villacampa were to devote\r\nthemselves to cutting the line of communications between Suchet and the\r\nKing. In this way employment would be found for all the French on the\r\nEast Coast, for Copons was to receive a reinforcement of 3,000 men, and\r\nwas to keep Decaen on the move by raids and forays.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this clause governed the whole of the instructions, ‘the\r\nGeneral Officers at the head of the troops must understand that the\r\nsuccess of all our endeavours in the ensuing campaign depends on _none\r\nof the corps being beaten_. They must not attack the enemy in strong\r\npositions: I shall forgive _anything_ excepting that one of the corps\r\nshould be beaten and dispersed.’ Wellington afterwards said that\r\nthis warning was intended for Elio and Del Parque only, but it had a\r\ndeleterious effect during the ensuing operations on all the actions\r\nof the timid and wavering Murray. To say to such an officer that it\r\nwould be a sin not to be forgiven if he let his corps get beaten under\r\nany circumstances, was to drive him to a policy of absolute cowardice.\r\nWellington was an austere master, and the mental effect of such a\r\nthreat was to make Murray resolve that he would not take even small\r\nand pardonable risks. The main idea that he had in his head in May\r\nand June 1813 was that he ‘must not allow his corps to be beaten and\r\ndispersed.’ Hence, like the unprofitable servant in the parable, he\r\nwas resolved to wrap it up in a napkin, and have it ready to return\r\nto his master intact--though thereby he might condemn himself to make\r\nno worthy use of it whatever while it was in his hands. The threat of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief might have been addressed profitably to Robert\r\nCraufurd; when administered to John Murray it produced terror and a\r\nsort of mental paralysis.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Murray’s weakness of will and instability of purpose\r\nwere so great that he would probably, in any case, have made a very\r\npoor game from the splendid cards put into his hand. But that the\r\nTarragona expedition ended in the discreditable fiasco which we shall\r\nhave to narrate, was undoubtedly the result in part of the impression\r\nwhich Wellington’s orders produced on his wavering mind. Yet,\r\ncontemptible as his conduct of operations was, still Suchet was kept\r\nemployed in the East and gave no help to King Joseph. That much was\r\nsecured by Wellington’s knowledge of how sea-power can be used.\r\n\r\nBy the 1st of May everything should have been ready, but the late\r\nspring and the slow-moving pontoons delayed the start. On the\r\n12th-13th-14th, however, every soldier, British and Portuguese, was\r\nready to march. Every available unit was being brought up--there\r\nremained behind only the fever-ridden Guards’ brigade at Oporto; the\r\nweak 77th, which provided, along with one Veteran Battalion, a skeleton\r\ngarrison for Lisbon; three Portuguese line regiments, two in Elvas,\r\none in Abrantes, and the dismounted dragoons of the same nation, who\r\nhad not taken the field for three years: only D’Urban’s and Campbell’s\r\nsquadrons marched in 1813. The infantry consisted of 56 British and\r\n53 Portuguese battalions--making about 67,000 bayonets. The British\r\nbattalions were of very unequal size--a few as low as 450 men, a few\r\nothers as strong as 900: the average was 700. The Portuguese battalions\r\nwere rather weaker, some of the regiments never having recovered from\r\nthe privations of the Burgos retreat, and did not exceed on an average\r\n500 bayonets or 550 of all ranks. Of cavalry there were 22 regiments,\r\nof which four only were Portuguese--total 8,000 sabres. Of artillery\r\nthere were 102 guns, in seventeen batteries, of which three were\r\nPortuguese and one belonged to the King’s German Legion[461]. Adding\r\nEngineers, Staff Corps, Wagon Train, &c., the whole represented 81,000\r\nmen of all ranks and all arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS OF HILL’S COLUMN: MAY 22-JUNE 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concentration of the southern wing of Wellington’s army for the\r\ngreat advance was in some ways a more difficult, in others an easier,\r\nproblem than the concentration of the northern wing.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the distances from which the various elements of\r\nHill’s force were to be drawn were in many cases shorter than those of\r\nGraham’s force; the roads were well known to all the troops, who had\r\nused them repeatedly in their moves up and down the Spanish-Portuguese\r\nfrontier in 1811-12; and, though poor enough, they were on the whole\r\nbetter than those of the Tras-os-Montes, which the northern column had\r\nto employ. No part of the British army had tried these latter routes\r\nsince the pursuit of Soult in 1809, and few remembered how bad they\r\nwere. But, on the other hand, the concentration of the southern column\r\nwas from points more remote from each other than those of the northern:\r\nthe divisions of the latter had all been collected in the Douro country\r\nduring the course of the spring, and started on their final march from\r\na single area: moreover, they were moving well inside Portugal, by\r\nroutes very remote from the enemy. But the larger half of the southern\r\nforce had to be brought up from a region far distant from that where\r\nthe smaller half was cantoned in May. For Hill’s two divisions, the\r\nBritish 2nd and the Portuguese independent division (so long commanded\r\nby Hamilton, but now under Silveira, the Conde de Amarante), had been\r\nsent back to the borders of Estremadura at the end of the Burgos\r\ncampaign, and were lying, much scattered, at points so remote from each\r\nother as Coria, Plasencia, Bejar, Bohoyo, and Brozas. Morillo’s Spanish\r\ndivision, so often associated before with Hill, was even farther off,\r\nsouth of the Tagus, in the Caçeres-Alcantara country. All these troops\r\nwould have to move up, in order to join Wellington, by routes not\r\nvery remote from the French division at Avila, which (as it will be\r\nremembered) had tried to beat up Hill’s winter-quarters as late as the\r\npreceding February. And there was a chance that, if the enemy were\r\nalert and well-informed, he might try to block Hill’s march, by coming\r\nout from the Puente de Congosto or some such point. If Wellington had\r\nonly known it, the French higher command had actually been fearing that\r\nHill might make a stroke at Avila by some of the passes leading from\r\nthe upper Tormes to the upper Adaja, and was nervous about this line of\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe plan for the concentration of the southern force was that Hill\r\nshould unite the 2nd Division, Morillo’s Spaniards, and Long’s\r\nCavalry[462] at Bejar, and then march by the pass through the Sierra\r\nde Francia to Miranda de Castanar and Tamames. Silveira, with the\r\nindependent Portuguese division, was to take a parallel route farther\r\nwest, by the pass of Perales, Peñaparda, and Moras Verdes, to the same\r\npoint[463]. These troops on arriving near Tamames would find themselves\r\nin touch with another column, which was already on the ground where\r\noperations were to begin. It consisted of the Light Division, which\r\nhad been cantoned on the Coa and Agueda during the winter, and Victor\r\nAlten’s, Fane’s, and Robert Hill’s cavalry brigades--the last-named\r\na unit new to the army, and lately arrived from Lisbon: it consisted\r\nof six squadrons from the three regiments of Household Cavalry. To\r\njoin these British troops came Julian Sanchez’s Castilian lancers--now\r\nreckoned regular cavalry and not a _partida_--and Carlos de España’s\r\nCastilian division, which had been wintering in the valleys above\r\nCiudad Rodrigo. When united, the whole strength of the southern wing of\r\nWellington’s army would be about 30,000 sabres and bayonets, including\r\nonly five brigades of British infantry, the equivalent of four brigades\r\nof Portuguese, and two Spanish divisions. The cavalry was very strong\r\nin proportion--this was intentional, as Wellington intended to keep\r\nout in his front such a strong cavalry screen that the enemy should\r\nhave no chance of discovering for some time that the column was not\r\nthe main Anglo-Portuguese army, but in fact a demonstrating force. The\r\nreal strength of his army, six of his old eight divisions, was marching\r\nunder Graham to turn the line of the Douro, far to the north.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd Wellington abandoned his head-quarters at Freneda, where he\r\nhad stopped ever since his return from Cadiz in January, and rode out\r\nto Ciudad Rodrigo; the Light Division and three cavalry brigades had\r\npreceded him to Santi Espiritus, ten miles in front, where they were in\r\ntouch with Silveira’s Portuguese, who formed Hill’s left-hand column,\r\nand had reached Tamames. Hill himself with the 2nd Division was a march\r\nbehind Silveira: Morillo’s Spaniards keeping more to the right, on the\r\nroad along the mountains, was moving from Los Santos and Fuenteroble,\r\nby the track which leads straight to Salamanca from the direct south.\r\nFar out on the left Julian Sanchez’s lancers were feeling their way\r\ntowards Ledesma and watching the western flank.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the union of the forces was complete, and the news that\r\ncame from all quarters was satisfactory. Villatte was in Salamanca,\r\nwith no more than his own infantry division and one regiment of cavalry\r\n[464]: he had small detachments on his flanks at Ledesma and Alba de\r\nTormes, but no friends nearer than Daricau at Zamora; and for Daricau\r\nfull employment was about to be found, since Graham’s great column was\r\nmarching straight upon him. It was pretty certain that King Joseph\r\nhad not yet ordered the general concentration which was the only\r\nthing that could save him from destruction. The French division at\r\nAvila had not moved: Madrid was being held, and as late as the 20th\r\nMaransin’s brigade had been at Toledo, and some of the Avila division\r\nat Monbeltran on the borders of Estremadura. The map showed, therefore,\r\nthat the Army of the South could not possibly meet on the Tormes in\r\ntime to succour Villatte, who would have either to retreat or to be\r\ndestroyed. And Villatte being driven off eastward on Cantalpino, or\r\nnorthward on Toro, the junction of the two wings of Wellington’s army\r\nat or near Zamora was certain.\r\n\r\nBut haste was necessary, wherefore the army advanced by very long\r\nmarches, through the devastated country over which it had passed in\r\nsuch different conditions seven months back. On the 25th, head-quarters\r\nwere at Matilla, with the infantry advancing in three parallel\r\ncolumns, the Light Division on the high road to Salamanca, Hill and\r\nSilveira to the right, Morillo still farther out, making for Alba de\r\nTormes. The satisfactory news came in that Villatte had withdrawn\r\nhis detachment from Ledesma, which indicated that he did not intend\r\nto keep touch with Daricau at Zamora, so that the passage of the\r\nDouro would be simplified[465]. A very long march on the 26th brought\r\nmatters to a crisis. Victor Alten’s cavalry pushing for Salamanca\r\nbridge, and Fane’s for the fords which lie above the town, found that\r\nVillatte had just evacuated it, after barricading and obstructing\r\nits exits, but was visible on the heights above the fords of Santa\r\nMarta (one of Wellington’s old positions of June 1812) in line of\r\nbattle. His delay in retreating is censured equally by Jourdan and by\r\nWellington--apparently he wished to be certain that he was not being\r\nimposed upon by a mere cavalry demonstration, and had a serious force\r\nopposite him: moreover, he was waiting to pick up his detachment from\r\nAlba de Tormes, which he had only just ordered to join him, when he\r\nheard that Long’s cavalry and Morillo were moving on that place.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the French in position the British cavalry pushed on with\r\nall speed, Alten through Salamanca city, Fane by the fords above,\r\nleaving the infantry far behind them, but hoping to detain the enemy\r\nlong enough to assure his destruction. Realizing over-late his\r\ndanger, Villatte moved off eastward when he recognized that heavy\r\nforces were concentrating upon him, and threatening his retreat. He\r\nmarched not for Toro, but due east by roads parallel with the Tormes.\r\n‘It is rather extraordinary,’ wrote Wellington that evening, ‘that\r\nhe should have marched by Cabrerizos and the ravine, which we used\r\nto think so bad for even a horse, and thence by Aldea Lengua[466].’\r\nAt any rate the two cavalry brigades caught him up not far from\r\nAldea Lengua, and, after scattering his rearguard of dragoons, rode\r\nin upon his infantry, which were marching hard in close column. The\r\ntactical conditions were exactly the same as those which had been seen\r\nduring the retreat of Picton and the 3rd Division from El Bodon to\r\nFuente Grimaldo in September 1811. The brigadiers, after trying some\r\npartial and ineffective charges[467], judged it useless to attack\r\nsteady and unbroken infantry in solid order, and contented themselves\r\nwith following the column at a cautious distance and picking up\r\nstragglers--just as Montbrun had done in 1811 on the way to Fuente\r\nGrimaldo. Fane’s horse-artillery battery got up, and put in some\r\ndamaging shots on the rear battalions, but they closed up and hurried\r\non. The day was hot, many of the French fell out of the ranks exhausted\r\nand were gleaned up on the way. Their divisional ammunition train got\r\njammed in a hollow road and was captured--the leading caisson had been\r\noverturned and blocked the exit of the rest. But the main body of\r\nthe infantry held on its way in a solid mass, and after five miles,\r\nWellington, who had just ridden up, ordered Fane and Alten to desist\r\nfrom the pursuit. Villatte, therefore, got off, leaving behind him a\r\ncouple of hundred prisoners, and some scores of men who had fallen\r\ndead from sunstroke and over-exertion, or had been knocked over by\r\nthe round-shot of Gardiner’s H.A. battery[468]. This was one more\r\nexample of the incapacity of cavalry unsupported to deal with unbroken\r\ninfantry, of which we have had to give so many previous instances. The\r\nonly exception to the rule was the extraordinary achievement of Bock’s\r\nheavy German dragoons at Garcia Hernandez on the day after the battle\r\nof Salamanca. Clearly Villatte waited too long, and should never have\r\nallowed himself to be caught so near Salamanca. He got off better\r\nthan he deserved[469], and picked up his detachment from Alba, which\r\ncame in upon him from the right a few miles farther on, beyond Babila\r\nFuente, cautiously pursued by Long’s Light Dragoons. The column went\r\nout of sight, retreating on Cantalpino, not on Toro--one more proof to\r\nWellington that the enemy was not going to attempt to strengthen the\r\nline of the Douro, but to concentrate somewhere about Medina del Campo\r\nor Valladolid.\r\n\r\nThe various infantry columns reached the neighbourhood of Salamanca on\r\nthe evening of the 26th, and crossed the Tormes, some by the bridge,\r\nsome by fords, next day. They were ordered to take up the position\r\nfacing north and east on the heights beyond the city which Wellington\r\nhad held against Marmont in June 1812. The Light Division was on the\r\nleft, the 2nd Division in the centre, Silveira’s Portuguese on the\r\nright at Cabrerizos, Morillo on the upper Tormes at Machacon with a\r\ndetachment in Alba. The cavalry patrolled towards Zamora, Toro, the\r\nfords of Fresno on the Douro, and also eastward toward the Guarena.\r\nHill now halted for six days--it was Wellington’s intention, now that\r\nhe had displayed himself in force at Salamanca, and set all the lines\r\nof French intelligence quivering, that the enemy should conclude that\r\nhis great attack was to be delivered between the Douro and the Tormes,\r\nand he hoped that they would attempt to parry it by a concentration\r\nin the region of Valladolid--Toro for the defence of the line of the\r\nDouro, or perhaps (but this was less likely) by a counter-offensive\r\nsouth of the Douro from the direction of Medina del Campo, so as to\r\ntake him in flank and prevent his further progress northward. Either of\r\nthese moves would fall in with his desires, since his real intention\r\nwas to turn the line of the Douro much lower down, in the direction\r\nof Zamora, by means of Graham’s corps, which was about to start from\r\nBraganza and Miranda on the very day of the occupation of Salamanca,\r\nand was due to arrive on the Esla, behind Zamora, on the 30th. It\r\npleased him well that Villatte should have retreated due east, that the\r\ncavalry found no hostile forces south of the Douro in the direction of\r\neither Zamora or Toro, and that it was reported that there was only one\r\nFrench infantry division holding those towns.\r\n\r\nHaving allowed time for the enemy to get full knowledge of his presence\r\nat Salamanca, and to act upon it--it was inevitable that they should\r\nregard the place where he had shown himself as the base of his future\r\noperations--Wellington made ready to transfer himself rapidly and\r\nsecretly to the other and stronger wing of his army, which Graham was\r\nnow conducting against the extreme western flank of the French line.\r\nOn May 28th he handed over the command of the southern wing to Hill,\r\nand announced his own departure. The orders given to Sir Rowland were\r\nthat he was, unless the unexpected happened, to make ready to march on\r\nthe Douro at Zamora the moment that he should receive news that Graham\r\nhad crossed the Esla[470]. Bridges should be ready for him, and the\r\nfortunate disappearance of the enemy’s horse from the region of Ledesma\r\nmade the rapid transmission of information between the two wings\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nThere was one possibility to be considered. Though Wellington was\r\nconvinced that the French would concentrate north of the Douro, in the\r\ndirection of Valladolid and Medina de Rio Seco, it was just conceivable\r\nthat they might take the other course of concentrating south of the\r\nriver, round Medina del Campo, and marching straight on Salamanca with\r\nall the troops that could be hastily drawn together. It was impossible\r\nfor them to gather their whole force in the few days that would be at\r\ntheir disposition; but conceivably they might think it worth while to\r\nmake a counter-stroke with such divisions as could be got together in\r\nhaste. It is interesting to know that such an idea did flash through\r\nJourdan’s mind for a moment, only to be rejected by King Joseph on\r\nthe advice of the other generals[471]. Should the French march on\r\nthe Tormes, a grave responsibility would be placed on Hill’s head.\r\nHe was told to give them battle ‘if he was strong enough’--i. e. to\r\njudge their force according to the best information to be had, not\r\nan easy thing, but Hill was pre-eminently clear-headed and averse to\r\nunnecessary risks. Should they be too numerous, he was not to retire\r\non Rodrigo by the route by which Wellington had come, but to throw up\r\nhis communication with that fortress, and move off in the direction\r\nof Zamora, carrying out at all costs the plan for the junction of the\r\ntwo wings of the army[472]. Nothing was to remain behind to cover\r\nthe Ciudad Rodrigo road and the Portuguese frontier but the single\r\nSpanish division of Carlos de España: all convoys on the march from\r\nSalamanca were to be turned off towards Ledesma and Zamora. It might\r\nlook perilous to leave Central Portugal unprotected, but Wellington was\r\nsure that the enemy would be so distracted by his great movement north\r\nof the Douro, that they would not dare to advance on Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nand Almeida, to strike at his old line of communications. Moreover, it\r\nwould not matter if they did, for his new line of communication was now\r\nentirely north of the Douro, and Oporto, not Lisbon, would be his base.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th at dawn Wellington rode off to the north-west, almost\r\nunattended, and Hill’s responsibility began. It was not to turn out a\r\nheavy one, since (as his chief had foreseen) the enemy was not in the\r\nleast thinking of taking up the offensive, but was rather expecting a\r\ncontinuation of the British advance from Salamanca. It did not come,\r\nand before the French had made up their minds as to what the halt of\r\nthe southern column might mean, they were attacked on the 30th by the\r\nnorthern column, whose existence had hitherto been hidden from them.\r\nHill therefore had only to wait for Wellington’s directions to march\r\nnorthward, when the date and route should be given. These orders\r\ndid not come till the 2nd of June, so that the southern corps had\r\nto remain for a week in its own cantonments round Salamanca, doing\r\nnothing more than watch the French, north and east, by means of cavalry\r\nreconnaissances.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the operations of the more important northern\r\ncorps, which crossed the Portuguese frontier on the 26th, four days\r\nafter Wellington had started out in person from Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS OF GRAHAM’S COLUMN: MAY 26-JUNE 3\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 18th Wellington had issued his final orders for the advance of\r\nthe great turning force under Graham, all of whose troops were due to\r\nconverge on the remote corner of Portugal between Braganza and Miranda\r\nde Douro between the 21st and 27th of the month. Many of them came from\r\nlong distances, and had to start early--the 1st Division from Vizeu as\r\nearly as May 13th; and left behind it, as hopelessly inefficient from\r\nsickness, Howard’s brigade of the Guards, reduced to a strength of 800\r\nbayonets by the fever which had ravaged its ranks during the spring.\r\nShifted from Vizeu to Oporto for the benefit of the milder climate,\r\nthis brigade could not be moved for another month, and missed the\r\ncampaign of Vittoria. The 5th, 6th, and 7th Divisions left their winter\r\nquarters in the Beira on the 14th, the 3rd and 4th, who were close to\r\nthe Douro or actually on it, at Moimenta and St. João de Pesqueira,\r\ncould afford not to move till the 16th. To secure a rapid movement for\r\nthe columns which had farthest to go, and to save any congestion of\r\ntraffic at the usual ferries of passage on the Douro--bridges there\r\nwere none--Wellington had collected a large number of barges and river\r\nboats at Peso de Regoa, St. João de Pesqueira, and the Barca of Poçinho\r\nnear the confluence of the Coa and the Douro.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the marches was calculated to allow the heavy\r\ninfantry columns to make use as far as possible of the only two good\r\nroads in the Tras-os-Montes, of which the one goes from the Douro to\r\nBraganza, the other to Miranda. The 1st and 5th Divisions crossed\r\nby the much-used ferry of Peso de Regoa near Lamego, and marched by\r\nVilla Real and Mirandella on two separate routes to the neighbourhood\r\nof Braganza[473]. The 3rd Division crossed the ferry at St. João de\r\nPesqueira and went by Villaflor and Vinhas to Vimioso, half-way between\r\nBraganza and Miranda. All these columns had some cross-road marching\r\nto do, where they were forced to cut across from one _chaussée_ to\r\nanother. The third column, the 4th, 6th, and 7th Divisions, more\r\nfortunate, was on the high road nearly all the way: after crossing the\r\nDouro at the ferry of Poçinho, they marched from Torre de Moncorvo\r\nby the great _chaussée_ to the frontier town of Miranda and the\r\nneighbouring village of Malhadas, where they were due to arrive on\r\nthree successive days (24th, 25th, 26th May). This column was followed\r\nby the all-important pontoon-train, and by the reserve of siege\r\nartillery--Portuguese 18-pounders under Major Ariaga[474]--as well as\r\nby the main ammunition train.\r\n\r\nThe three British cavalry brigades which Wellington had allotted to the\r\ngreat turning movement, those of Anson, Bock, and Ponsonby, had been\r\ncantoned in the winter months in the lower Beira, along the coast, and\r\nin the valley of the Vouga. Before the infantry had moved, they had all\r\nthree been brought north of the Douro about May 1, through Oporto, and\r\nbilleted in Braga, Guimaraens, San Tyrso, and neighbouring villages. On\r\nMay 12th orders set them moving eastward to the Braganza country--their\r\nmarch was much more fatiguing than that of the infantry divisions, for\r\nthere are no high roads of any value going directly from the Braga\r\ncountry to the direction of Miranda and Braganza--all run north and\r\nsouth, not east and west. Though allotted short daily stages of only\r\nthree or four leagues, the cavalry found the route fatiguing--the\r\nmountain cross-roads were more like staircases than paths--the horse\r\nartillery accompanying the brigades had in some cases to swerve off\r\nfrom its itinerary and take circuitous turns[475]: in others it had to\r\nbe man-handled down precipitous tracks. The only horsemen who had an\r\neasy job were the Portuguese brigade of D’Urban, who had been wintering\r\nat Braganza, and had only to advance a few miles to the frontier, and\r\nGrant’s newly-arrived Hussar Brigade which, coming from the south,\r\nfollowed the infantry column that went by Torre de Moncorvo to Miranda,\r\nalong the high road all the way.\r\n\r\nPack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese infantry, who (like D’Urban’s\r\ndragoons) had wintered north of the Douro, at Penafiel and Villa Real\r\nrespectively, had a short way to go, and were timed to arrive at\r\nBraganza before the heavy columns from the south came up.\r\n\r\nPortugal and Spain, as is well known, turn their backs on each other\r\nfor the greater part of their long frontier, and though there were\r\ndecent _chaussées_ from the Douro to Braganza and Miranda they stopped\r\nshort at the boundary line. From thence onward there were no good roads\r\ntill Zamora was reached, and those bad ones which existed were country\r\ntracks, only useful for operations in the summer. That they could be so\r\nused, for all arms, in May and June, was one of Wellington’s secrets,\r\nwhich he trusted that the French would never guess. For both parties\r\nduring the war had left alone this remote corner of the Peninsula. The\r\nonly operations seen near it had been Soult’s spring campaign of 1809,\r\nand the forays of Silveira’s militia when they occasionally raided\r\ntowards Zamora.\r\n\r\nCountry roads, however, existed between the Sierra de Culebra and the\r\nbend of the Douro between Zamora and Miranda, and the whole detail of\r\nGraham’s march depended on their practicability: Wellington had caused\r\nthe whole region as far as the Esla to be explored by his intelligence\r\nofficers, and the report had been that the movement of all arms was\r\npossible in the summer. The permanent bridges of the Esla, from\r\nBenavente down to its confluence with the Douro, had been broken long\r\nago; but there was a certain number of fords, and convenient places for\r\nthe laying of temporary bridges. By the end of May it was calculated\r\nthat the spring floods due to the melting of snows in the Galician and\r\nAsturian mountains would be over, and that the river would be down to\r\nits normal low summer level. On these facts depended the success of\r\nthe operation, which must be a rapid one, in order that the French\r\nmight have no time for concentration. But Wellington’s provident\r\nmind had taken into consideration the possibility of unexpected\r\nhigh-water, and as a matter of precaution he had ordered up his main\r\npontoon-train from the Tagus. To get the cumbrous pontoons, 33 of\r\nthem, from Abrantes to Miranda de Douro by land was no small matter.\r\nThey travelled slowly on specially constructed wheeled trucks[476] by\r\nCastello Branco, Sabugal, and Pinhel, crossed the Douro at Villa Nova\r\nde Foscoa, and were then brought up on the Miranda high road as far as\r\nVilla Velha, where they were halted for a short time, as Wellington\r\nwas not quite certain whether he would not lay them at Espadacinta on\r\nthe middle Douro, rather than farther up, beyond Miranda. For across\r\nthe pontoons he intended to lay the main line of communication between\r\nGraham’s and Hill’s wings of the army, and if the latter failed to get\r\nforward on the Tormes and to open up touch with Graham via Zamora, it\r\nmight be necessary to throw the bridge at some lower point, such as\r\nEspadacinta[477]. On the 20th he made up his mind that 14 pontoons\r\nshould be sent to Espadacinta, while the remaining 19 should proceed\r\nto Miranda, and from thence follow the course of the Douro to the\r\npoint where they would be laid--probably the ferry of Villa al Campo,\r\na mile below the confluence of the Esla and the Douro. The nineteen\r\nall-important trucks with their burdens reached Miranda safely, and\r\nmoved close behind the right-hand column of Graham’s army during its\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nDown to May 26 all the British troops had been kept behind the\r\nPortuguese frontier, nothing having been sent beyond it save D’Urban’s\r\nPortuguese dragoons, who formed a screen some little way on the Spanish\r\nside. Their appearance would, in the event of a French cavalry raid\r\nfrom Zamora, create no suspicion of there being in the rear anything\r\nmore than the usual Tras-os-Montes militia. Nor could spies draw any\r\ndeduction from their presence.\r\n\r\nBut on the 26th the whole of Graham’s army[478] started out in three\r\ncolumns arranged as follows:\r\n\r\n1. From Braganza marched, as the northern column, Anson’s light and\r\nPonsonby’s heavy dragoon brigades, preceding the 1st Infantry division\r\nand Pack’s Portuguese independent brigade. Crossing the frontier river,\r\nthe Manzanas, at fords by Nuez, they were ordered to move on Tabara in\r\nfour marches, by the country road through Sesnande.\r\n\r\n2. From Outeiro and Vimioso marched, as the central column, following\r\nD’Urban’s Portuguese light horse (who were already over the border),\r\nBock’s heavy German dragoons accompanied by the 3rd and 5th Divisions\r\nand Bradford’s independent Portuguese brigade. They were directed to\r\nmove by Alcanizas in four marches on Losilla, five miles south of\r\nTabara.\r\n\r\n3. From Miranda de Douro marched, as the right column, close to the\r\nriver, the 4th, 6th, and 7th Divisions; their cavalry, Grant’s hussar\r\nbrigade, overtook them on the second day. Having a shorter distance to\r\ncover than the other two columns, their van was to reach Carvajales on\r\nthe 28th, in three marches. On the 30th the pontoons, which followed\r\nin their rear, were to reach the ferry of Villa al Campo, where it was\r\nintended that they should be laid down across the Douro.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand or northern column was to get into touch with the Army of\r\nGalicia--Barcena’s and Losada’s divisions and Penne Villemur’s cavalry,\r\nabout 12,000 strong, who, marching from Astorga on the 26th, were to be\r\nat the broken bridge of Benavente on the Esla on the 29th-30th.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Graham’s force was marching on a very compact\r\nfront, the central column being not more than five or six miles distant\r\nfrom each of the flanking ones, so that the whole could be assembled\r\nfor action, in the unlikely event of opposition being met, in a very\r\nfew hours. The cavalry screen of five brigades was so strong that\r\nit was impossible for any French horse which might be in the Zamora\r\ndirection to pierce it, or discover what was behind. The whole army\r\ncounted not less than 42,000 sabres and bayonets, exclusive of the\r\nGalicians--as strong an Anglo-Portuguese force as that with which\r\nWellington had fought the battle of Salamanca, and outnumbering\r\nconsiderably the other wing of Wellington’s army, which was marching\r\nsouth of the Douro.\r\n\r\nBy an extraordinary piece of luck the attention of the French higher\r\ncommand was completely distracted at the moment from the Esla front,\r\nas a result of the last authentic reports received from that direction.\r\nFor as late as May 20th Reille had sent Boyer’s division of dragoons\r\nacross the Esla at Benavente, to make a sweep to the north and west in\r\nthe direction of La Baneza and the road to Puebla Senabria. They had\r\ngone almost as far as Astorga without meeting troops of any kind; and\r\nreported that some of the Galician army were at Astorga, but that they\r\nhad heard of no British save two or three commissaries, who had been\r\nbuying up barley and wheat in the valley of the Tera, which were to be\r\nsent back into Portugal[479]. Reille drew the natural deduction, that\r\nthere was nothing stirring in this part of the world, and Boyer, after\r\nthoroughly destroying the bridge of Castro Gonzalo outside Benavente,\r\nwent back to his former cantonments east of the Esla. If the raid had\r\nbeen made a week later, he could not have failed to bring news of the\r\nadvance of the Galicians, and would probably have heard of Graham’s\r\nmovements from Braganza and Miranda de Douro. But by the 27th all the\r\nattention of the French generals was already distracted to Wellington’s\r\nmarch against Salamanca, at the head of Hill’s column, and the Esla\r\nfront received little notice. There remained opposite the advancing\r\ntroops of Graham only Daricau’s infantry division of the Army of the\r\nSouth, with a brigade each at Zamora and Toro, and three regiments of\r\nDigeon’s dragoons watching the Esla from San Cebrian to its juncture\r\nwith the Douro, and at the same time keeping a look-out southward\r\ntowards Salamanca. For the cavalry of Hill’s column was already on the\r\n27th-28th pushing out northward towards Zamora as well as eastward\r\ntowards the Guarena. On the 28th this danger began to prey so much on\r\nDaricau’s mind that he withdrew all his infantry save four companies\r\nfrom Zamora, leaving Digeon’s dragoons practically unsupported to\r\nwatch rather than to defend the line of the Esla. Urgent requests were\r\nsent to the cavalry of the Army of Portugal, farther north along that\r\nriver, to keep touch with Digeon and help him if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry at the head of Graham’s three columns reached their\r\ndestinations--Tabara, Losilla, Carvajales, on May 28th--the infantry\r\non the 29th. No French parties were found on the hither side of the\r\nEsla, and though the peasantry reported that there were vedettes on\r\nthe farther bank, none were seen. Exploration of the course of the\r\nEsla, however, led to the vexatious discovery that the river was very\r\nhigh, owing to torrential rain on the night of the 28th-29th, and\r\nthat some of the fords intended for use were probably impracticable\r\nfor cavalry, most certainly so for infantry. Graham, though vexed at\r\nthe delay, refused to push across the water with horsemen alone, and\r\nwaited for the pontoon-train--due on the 30th--to come up, resolving to\r\nlay it across the Esla, and not across the Douro as had been at first\r\nintended. Meanwhile the French showed no signs of life on the 30th--it\r\nhad been feared that Daricau might come out of Zamora, only eight\r\nmiles away, with infantry and guns, to oppose the passage. But, as we\r\nhave seen, he had really departed on the 28th, and there was nothing\r\nopposite Graham but a cavalry screen. The main attack seemed to the\r\nFrench generals to be on the side of Salamanca, where Wellington was\r\nknown to have been present on May 27th. Digeon had discovered on the\r\n29th that there were British troops on the opposite bank of the Esla,\r\nbut had no notion of their strength or purpose[480].\r\n\r\nBut if Wellington’s presence marked the danger-point, it was\r\nnow suddenly displaced. On the morning of the 29th the British\r\nCommander-in-Chief had gone off on one of his not unusual lightning\r\nrides. Starting early from Salamanca, he rode by Ledesma to the Douro\r\nopposite Miranda--over 50 miles--before dark. Facing Miranda there is\r\nno road on the Spanish side, the river descends fiercely in something\r\nlike cataracts, with high rocks on its eastern bank. The only\r\ncommunication from shore to shore was by a rope and basket contrivance,\r\nworked by a windlass, and stretched high above the water. By this\r\nstrange method Wellington crossed the Douro--what would have been the\r\nresults of the campaign of 1813 if the ropes had been rotten? He slept\r\nat Miranda, started off at dawn on the 30th and was at Carvajales--20\r\nmiles away--by the afternoon, not so tired but that he could write\r\ndispatches to Hill and Giron that night, and settle with Graham the\r\ndispositions for next morning.\r\n\r\nWellington’s first decision was that the pontoons, which had come up\r\non the 30th, should be laid not on the Douro at Villa al Campo, but on\r\nthe Esla opposite Almendra, where the high road from Puebla Senabria to\r\nZamora crossed the river. But at the same time attempts were to be made\r\nto get cavalry (and infantry if possible) across the water at other\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 31st Grant’s hussar brigade entered the ford of\r\nAlmendra, where it was intended that the bridge should be laid; each\r\nman of the leading squadron had an infantry soldier of the 7th Division\r\nhanging on to his stirrup. At the same time Bock’s German dragoons\r\nand D’Urban’s Portuguese essayed the ford at Pallomilla, opposite\r\nMontemarta, four miles up-stream. The hussars crossed with great\r\ntrouble--the bottom was stony, the water had risen in the night, some\r\nhorses lost their footing--many of the infantry stepped into holes, or\r\nstumbled and were carried away. The majority were saved, but ten of the\r\n51st and rather more of the Brunswickers were swept right down-stream\r\nand drowned. Yet, despite mishaps, the hussars got over, and, advancing\r\nrapidly, surprised the French cavalry picquet at the village of Val\r\nde Perdrices, a little way up-stream, taking it whole--an officer and\r\n32 men. This was certainly about the most extraordinary instance of\r\ncarelessness on the part of outposts during the war, and reflects as\r\nmuch discredit on Digeon, whose dragoons were supposed to be watching\r\nthe lower Esla, as on the wretched officer in charge of the picquet.\r\nHow was it possible that such a large body as a brigade could approach\r\nin daylight the best-known ford of the neighbourhood, at a spot where\r\nthe course of the high road showed the convenience of the passage,\r\nwithout finding a single vedette on the bank? And why was such an\r\nimportant point watched (or not watched) by a half-troop, instead of by\r\na force which could have offered at least a momentary opposition, and\r\nhave passed the alarm to its regiment, which, as Digeon’s report shows,\r\nwas at Iniesta, only four miles to the rear?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bock’s Germans and D’Urban’s Portuguese dragoons had an\r\nequally difficult, though equally unopposed, passage at the ford of\r\nPalomilla, four miles up-stream. The river was running furiously,\r\nand seven or eight horses and three or four men were washed away and\r\ndrowned. Anson’s light dragoons at the head of the third column had\r\nan even worse experience at San Vincente del Barco, opposite San\r\nCebrian: the ford was found utterly impracticable, and the brigade was\r\nordered back toward Tabara: on its way it was turned off to a second\r\nprojected crossing-spot farther south. This was also discovered to be\r\nhopeless, and finally the whole northern column was ordered to cross\r\nat Almendra, behind the southern column. After a day’s profitless\r\ncountermarching[481], it came down thither, to find the pontoons laid,\r\nthe infantry of the southern column all across the river, and well\r\nforward, while that of the centre column was crossing rapidly. In the\r\nend all Graham’s troops save the leading cavalry brigades had to use\r\nthe bridge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Grant’s hussars, advancing on Zamora, found that the French\r\nhad evacuated it in haste on the first news of the crossing of the\r\nEsla. Digeon, with his two regiments of dragoons, his half-battery\r\nof horse artillery, and the four companies of voltigeurs, had gone\r\noff to Toro. Wellington therefore was able to occupy Zamora without\r\nopposition on the night following the passage of the fords[482], and\r\nmoved his head-quarters thither next day. The moment that he knew that\r\nDaricau and Digeon had absconded, he sent orders to Hill to march not\r\non Zamora, or the ford of Villa al Campo, as he had at first intended,\r\nbut directly on Toro, which would save twenty miles marching for the\r\nright wing. For it was clear that Digeon and Daricau could not hold\r\nToro with some 6,000 men against Graham’s 40,000, now across the Esla\r\nand in close pursuit of them. And there was no great body of French\r\navailable to reinforce them within a couple of days’ march--at most\r\nReille’s horse and one infantry division could have come up. On June\r\n1st the signs were that the enemy would not stand--Digeon’s dragoons\r\nwere falling back on the Toro road--Reille’s cavalry, heard of at\r\nBelver in the morning, had gone off eastward towards Medina del Rio\r\nSeco in haste. Wherefore Wellington pushed on fast on that day, sending\r\non Graham’s columns by the two roads Zamora-Toro and Zamora-Rio Seco,\r\nwhich do not diverge sufficiently to make it impossible to concentrate\r\nthe troops on them in a few hours. But caution proved unnecessary. The\r\nFrench evacuated Toro in the afternoon, so that the junction-point with\r\nHill was safely secured, and Graham’s divisions were present in full\r\nforce next morning, to cover the passage of the southern wing across\r\nthe Douro.\r\n\r\nWellington moved his head-quarters to Toro on the morning of June 2nd,\r\nand sent out his cavalry on all the roads which branch out from it:\r\nAnson’s and Bock’s brigades going north-east occupied Vezdemarben.\r\nGrant’s hussars pushing along the river-road toward Tordesillas came up\r\nwith Digeon’s rear at Morales, six miles outside Toro, and fell upon\r\nit vigorously. The French dragoons--two regiments--were drawn up in\r\na defensive position, with a swamp in front and bridge over a ravine\r\nbehind. Grant charging furiously with the 10th Hussars and the 18th in\r\nsupport on the flank, broke the front regiment, whereupon the enemy\r\nwent to the rear in disorder, and was chased for two miles, prisoners\r\nbeing captured in considerable numbers. At last pursuers and pursued\r\nran in on the rear brigade of Daricau’s infantry, drawn up in good\r\norder, with a battery across the road, on the heights of Pedroso del\r\nRey. Grant had therefore to call off his men, and to wait for the enemy\r\nto retire, which they presently did in good order. Two officers and 208\r\nmen, all of the 16th Dragoons, were captured[483], about a hundred\r\nof them wounded[484]; the rest were mainly taken owing to the bad\r\ncondition of their mounts, ‘raw-boned horses with evident marks of bad\r\nprovender, escort duties, and counter-marches--nearly the whole of them\r\nhad horrible sore backs.’ The 10th Hussars had only 16 casualties--one\r\nof them an officer who had pursued incautiously and ridden into the\r\nFrench infantry, by whom he was wounded and taken prisoner. This was\r\na good day’s record for the 10th Hussars, who started their first\r\nPeninsular service--they had only landed in February--with a very\r\nhandsome success.\r\n\r\nDuring the day of the combat of Morales Hill’s infantry had started\r\noff from their billets in the villages ten miles north of Salamanca to\r\nmove on Toro. A forced march of over twenty miles, through Fuentesauco,\r\nacross a very bare and desolate country, brought the head of the column\r\ndown to the Douro, where they encamped among well-watered fields and\r\nvegetable gardens. ‘Officers and men, after the long sultry day,\r\ndevoured with zest and relish the raw cabbages, onions, and melons.’\r\nNext morning (June 3rd) the whole column began to cross the river at\r\nToro, the artillery and baggage by a ford no more than knee-deep, the\r\ninfantry by the fine but broken bridge. Only one arch of it had been\r\nblown up, and a resourceful engineer, Lieutenant Pringle, had contrived\r\nan easy method of utilizing it. A row of long ladders had been laid\r\nagainst each side of the gap in the roadway: their feet inclined\r\ntogether and united in the shallow water below. Long and stout planks\r\nhad then been laid across, resting at each end on the rungs of each\r\npair of corresponding ladders, and making a sort of platform. The men\r\nwent down the upper rungs of one set of ladders, walked a few steps\r\nover the planks, and ascended by the rungs of the ladders on the other\r\nside. This was rather tedious for the passage of four divisions, and\r\ntook the whole day and the following morning. But by noon on June 4\r\nthe entire army was concentrated in the vicinity of Toro on the north\r\nbank. Its cavalry was many miles in advance, at Pedroso del Rey on the\r\nTordesillas road, Almaraz and Villavelid on the Rio Seco road. Parties\r\nsent out northward had got in touch with Giron’s Galician army, which\r\nhad passed Benavente on June 1 and reached Villalpando on the 3rd, with\r\nPenne Villemur’s squadrons out in its front.\r\n\r\nThus every man of Wellington’s striking force, 80,000 sabres and\r\nbayonets, was concentrated north of Toro on the night of June 3--all\r\nthe British in a single mass, the Galicians some 18 miles off on the\r\nflank, but easily available. Nothing was now south of the Douro save\r\nCarlos de España’s Spanish division, left to garrison Salamanca, and\r\nJulian Sanchez’s horse, who were searching the roads south of the\r\nriver, and had just captured a large French cavalry patrol at Castro\r\nNuño, near Pollos. It seemed to Wellington incredible that the enemy\r\nwould reply to his stroke at their communications by a similar stroke\r\nat his on the Salamanca-Rodrigo line. Indeed, all reports showed them\r\nmoving north, in order to form opposite him on the north bank of\r\nthe Douro. Moreover, it was clear that they would have the greatest\r\ndifficulty in concentrating a sufficient force to fight him, for\r\nthe possession of Valladolid and the defence of the great northern\r\n_chaussée_. The first stage of his plan had been completed with entire\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF THE FRENCH: MAY 22-JUNE 4\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Wellington launched his two great columns into\r\nSpain, the French head-quarters staff was in a condition of nervous\r\nexpectation. The spring was so far advanced that it had been expected\r\nthat the Allies would have been already on the move, and their long\r\nquiescence was supposed, very reasonably, to cover some new plan which\r\nit was impossible to divine. The position of the French armies was very\r\nunfavourable, entirely owing to the continued absence from the front of\r\nthe whole infantry of the Army of Portugal, which, by Napoleon’s desire\r\nand by the detailed instructions of the Minister of War at Paris, had\r\nbeen lent to the Army of the North, and sent backward into Biscay,\r\nNavarre, and Aragon to hunt the guerrilleros. Five and a half out of\r\nthe six divisions of Reille’s command were still occupied on these\r\nmarches and counter-marches in the rear, when May was far spent, and\r\nwhen the offensive of the Allies must be expected at every moment.\r\n\r\nThe French army, available for immediate operations, was therefore\r\nshort of one-third of its strength, and Jourdan and King Joseph\r\ndisliked the situation. Jourdan confesses in his Memoirs that he and\r\nhis master ought to have ordered Clausel to suspend his operations,\r\nhowever incomplete they might be, and to send back all the borrowed\r\ninfantry to the valley of the Douro. But the minister’s letters\r\nkept repeating so often that the campaign north of the Ebro must be\r\ncompleted at all costs, that the King considered that he could do no\r\nmore than transmit to Paris the warnings that he was receiving, urging\r\non the minister that it was time to suspend those operations, and\r\nthat General Clausel should be ordered to come back in haste towards\r\nBurgos[485]. This self-exculpation of Jourdan shows clearly enough the\r\nmiserable consequences of the system of double-command which Napoleon\r\nhad always kept up in Spain. The habit of sending orders direct from\r\nParis to fractions of the Army of Spain was so deeply ingrained, that\r\nthe titular Commander-in-Chief and his Chief of the Staff dared not\r\nissue instructions of primary importance to one of the generals under\r\nthem without obtaining leave from the Emperor! And at this moment\r\nthe Emperor was not even at Paris--he had long been at the front in\r\nGermany, and had fought the battle of Lützen on May 2. What came from\r\nParis was not even the orders of Napoleon, but the orders of Clarke,\r\ntransmitting his impression of the imperial will from dispatches\r\nalready many days old, which would be doubly out of date before they\r\nreached Valladolid. The supreme master must take the responsibility of\r\nthe fact that on May 15 or May 18 his representatives in Spain were\r\nasking for leave to modify his arrangements, by petitions which could\r\nreceive no reply--for mere reasons of space and time--till the crisis\r\nwhich they were fearing had burst upon them. The whole system was\r\nruinous--in 1813 as it had been in 1812. The only rational method would\r\nhave been to turn over the whole conduct of affairs in Spain to some\r\nlocal authority, supreme in everything and responsible for everything.\r\nYet stronger men than Joseph and Jourdan would perhaps have taken the\r\nrisk of offending their master, and have issued peremptory orders,\r\nwhich Clausel, Foy, and the other outlying generals would probably have\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nOn May 20 the distribution of the Army of Spain was as follows:\r\nKing Joseph and the 2,500 men of his guards, horse and foot, lay at\r\ngeneral head-quarters at Valladolid. Of the two infantry divisions of\r\nD’Erlon’s Army of the Centre, one, that of Darmagnac, had been lent\r\nto Reille, when all the infantry of the Army of Portugal had been\r\nborrowed from him, and was lying at Medina de Rio Seco, in the rear of\r\nReille’s cavalry, who were watching from a discreet distance the Army\r\nof Galicia and the roads in the direction of Astorga and Leon. It will\r\nbe remembered that on May 20 Reille, hearing vague rumours of allied\r\nmovements beyond the Esla, had executed a great sweep with Boyer’s\r\ndragoons across the bridge of Benavente, and for five leagues beyond\r\nit, had found nothing, and had reported that there were no British\r\ntroops in the direction, and no Spaniards nearer than Astorga[486].\r\n\r\nThe other division of the Army of the Centre, that of Cassagne, was at\r\nSegovia, far south of the Douro, keeping touch with the large garrison\r\nstill left in Madrid, which, as long as it was maintained there, could\r\nnot be left in a state of absolute isolation.\r\n\r\nOf the Army of the South, Gazan had his head-quarters at Arevalo,\r\nnot very far from the King at Valladolid, but retained with him\r\nonly Tilly’s cavalry division. The rest of his troops were woefully\r\ndispersed. Daricau’s division and Digeon’s dragoons lay at Zamora and\r\nToro--nearly 100 miles from head-quarters--maintaining a loose touch\r\nwith Reille’s cavalry. Villatte--with one detached regiment of Digeon’s\r\ndragoons to keep watch for him--was at Salamanca--fifty miles from\r\nDaricau. Conroux, with a third division, was at Avila, with a whole\r\nblock of mountains between him and Villatte. He was supposed to be\r\nwatching Hill, and had detachments as far out as Monbeltran on the\r\nborders of Estremadura. He was also separated from the force at Madrid\r\nby several sierras and the formidable pass of the Guadarrama. In the\r\ncapital itself lay Leval with one more division, while the independent\r\nbrigade of Maransin[487], had been intermittently holding Toledo, and\r\nwas actually there on the 20th, in company with a brigade of light\r\ncavalry under Pierre Soult[488]. The extreme outer flanks of the Army\r\nof the South were as far apart therefore as Zamora and Toledo--160\r\nmiles as the crow flies--and a Spanish crow has rough country to fly\r\nover--and each of them was some 90 miles by road from the head-quarters\r\nin the centre.\r\n\r\nAs to the infantry of the Army of Portugal, the only element of it\r\nwhich lay anywhere near head-quarters was a brigade of Maucune’s at\r\nPalencia on the Carrion, which was guarding a large dépôt of stores and\r\ntransport. The other brigade of Maucune’s was at Burgos. Lamartinière’s\r\ndivision (late that commanded for so long by Bonnet) was watching\r\nthe great _chaussée_ from Burgos by Briviesca to Miranda del Ebro,\r\nin order to keep touch with Clausel in Navarre. Similarly Sarrut’s\r\ndivision, after its long and fruitless chase of Longa, was keeping safe\r\nthe roads from Bilbao to Miranda, in order to link Foy with the main\r\narmy. Foy himself was on the shores of the Bay of Biscay, where he had\r\nstormed Castro-Urdiales on May 12, and was trying to make an end of the\r\nlocal guerrilleros. The other two divisions of Reille’s infantry were\r\nlost to sight in the mountains of Navarre, where they were marching\r\nand countermarching with Clausel, in pursuit of the elusive Mina.\r\nThese were the divisions of Taupin and of Barbot: the troops which\r\nwere working along with them were the two ‘active’ divisions of the\r\nArmy of the North, those of Abbé and Vandermaesen. Clausel’s great\r\nflying column, of 15,000 men or more, was so continually on the move\r\nthrough regions where cross-communication was impossible, owing to the\r\ninsurrection, that it could not be located with certainty on any given\r\ndate, or receive instruction without a delay that might run to eight or\r\nten days.\r\n\r\nObviously it would take the French army a week to concentrate on\r\nValladolid or Arevalo, if Wellington should be aiming at Salamanca and\r\nthe Central Douro. But if he were about to attack one of the extreme\r\nwings, at Zamora or Madrid, the time required would be much greater.\r\nAnd Joseph and Jourdan were not at all sure that the secret plan of\r\nWellington might not be a thrust, with Hill’s force as the spear-head,\r\nat Madrid. One of the many false rumours sent to head-quarters was that\r\nforage had been ordered for Long’s cavalry at Escalona on the Tietar,\r\nmany miles in front of Talavera. While another report truly chronicled\r\nthe concentration of Hill’s brigades at Bejar, and the gathering of\r\nstores there, but interpreted their meaning as preparation for a march\r\non Avila by the Puente de Congosto.\r\n\r\nUncertain as to what was Wellington’s plan, the French Higher Command\r\nfinally resolved to await its manifestation before giving the final\r\norders--a system which was certain to lead to some initial loss of\r\nterritory at the opening of the campaign, since the enemy would have a\r\nweek in hand, before he could be opposed by a sufficient mass on the\r\nline which he might select. On May 18th Jourdan ordered Gazan to push\r\nexploring reconnaissances towards the Portuguese frontier, and, if\r\nWellington should be met advancing, to order Leval to evacuate Madrid,\r\nto send forward all his cavalry to support Villatte at Salamanca, and,\r\nwhen the latter should be driven in, to have his whole army ready to\r\nreceive him behind the line of the Trabancos river, except Daricau’s\r\ndivision, which should remain at Toro. Reille was to bring forward\r\nDarmagnac’s infantry from Rio Seco to support his cavalry on the Esla,\r\nand to unite Maucune’s scattered force by calling up his rear brigade\r\nfrom Burgos, so as to provide a reserve for Darmagnac. If Wellington\r\nshould advance, as was thought most probable, from Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nmarching on Salamanca in full strength, and driving in Villatte, it\r\nwas intended to bring in all the troops of Gazan and D’Erlon to the\r\nnorth bank of the Douro, and to defend the course of that river from\r\nToro to Tordesillas, as Marmont had done in June 1812. If the British\r\nshowed strength on the Esla, which was thought unlikely, Reille would\r\nreinforce Daricau and Digeon with all his cavalry and the divisions\r\nof Darmagnac and Maucune. But no definite orders were sent either\r\nto Clausel[489] or to Foy, Sarrut, and Lamartinière--the directions\r\nto be given them would depend on the strength which the British\r\ndisplayed, and the front on which they appeared. Thus a week or more\r\nafter Wellington should have shown his hand, the two armies of the\r\nSouth and Centre, with the cavalry and one infantry division of the\r\nArmy of Portugal, ought to be concentrated on the required points\r\nnorth of the Douro, with the possibility of bringing up later the five\r\nmissing divisions of the Army of Portugal, and Clausel’s two disposable\r\ndivisions from the Army of the North. But these last might take a very\r\nlong time to appear, and meanwhile there would only be 45,000 infantry\r\nand 10,000 cavalry in hand opposite Wellington[490]. Considering the\r\nlatter’s estimated numerical superiority, it seemed that he might be\r\nbrought to a stand, but hardly beaten, by the forces which the King\r\ncould collect. A defensive campaign on the Douro was really Jourdan’s\r\nforecast of the game; it might perhaps be turned into an offensive,\r\nwhen the missing divisions of the Army of Portugal and Clausel should\r\ncome up, with some 30,000 men of reinforcements.\r\n\r\nIt is a nervous business to wait for the move which finally betrays\r\nthe enemy’s intention, as every one knows who remembers August 1914.\r\nIt was probably with some feeling of relief that Gazan at Arevalo and\r\nKing Joseph at Palencia heard, on the 24th, that Wellington had passed\r\nthe Agueda on the 22nd, and was apparently marching on Salamanca in\r\ngreat strength. Conroux sent in news that Hill was at the same time\r\nmarching up from Bejar northward--not turning east. The campaign\r\ntherefore, as it appeared, was to take the form which had seemed most\r\nprobable, and the hypothetical orders for concentration which had been\r\nissued to the generals on the 18th became valid. But Gazan lost a day\r\nin evacuating Madrid, by riding over from Arevalo to Valladolid and\r\nformally requesting the King’s authorization for the retreat of Leval\r\nfrom the capital. So the aide-de-camp bearing the dispatch of recall\r\nonly started from Valladolid on the morning of the 25th, instead of\r\nfrom Arevalo on the afternoon of the 24th: it was clear therefore that\r\nLeval would be late at the concentration point.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the French scheme were carried out according to plan\r\nbetween the 25th and the 29th. When Villatte found himself attacked\r\nat Salamanca, and got away with some loss eastward on the 26th, he\r\nfell back on Medina del Campo, and found waiting for him there on\r\nthe 28th Conroux’s division from Avila and the division of cavalry\r\nwhich Gazan had been keeping at his head-quarters at Arevalo--Tilly’s\r\ndragoons. D’Erlon was in march from Segovia with Cassagne’s division\r\nand Treillard’s horse, and had reached Olmedo, only fifteen miles from\r\nMedina, so that he would be available next day. The whole made up a\r\nforce of 16,000 foot and 4,000 horse. But Leval was late, and would not\r\nbe up for three days more, nor had Maucune’s brigade yet come down from\r\nBurgos, while Daricau and Digeon began to look uncomfortably remote in\r\ntheir position at Toro and Zamora, where only Reille could reach them.\r\n\r\nJoseph and Jourdan had intended to take position behind the Zapardiel\r\non the 30th, there to demonstrate against Wellington, who ought by\r\nthis time to be coming down upon them. It was necessary to hold him in\r\ncheck till Leval should have got in from Madrid to join the main body,\r\nand then all would retire beyond the Douro, to the intended defensive\r\nposition. But this day two disquieting facts became notable: one was\r\nthat Wellington was not advancing from Salamanca: the troops that he\r\nhad brought thither had not moved since the 26th. The other was that\r\nDigeon sent word that there were allied forces approaching the lower\r\nEsla from the direction of Braganza, although Reille had reported ten\r\ndays back that there were absolutely no signs of allied movement from\r\nthis direction--their numbers were as yet incalculable. The suspicion,\r\nthen for the first time, arose that the Salamanca advance might be\r\na mere feint, despite of Wellington’s personal appearance in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 1st suspicion became certainty. Digeon reported\r\nthat the British had crossed the Esla in great force, by several fords,\r\nand that he and Daricau were retiring on Toro at once. Joseph would\r\nhave liked to go behind the Douro without delay, but could not possibly\r\ndo so until Leval, Maransin, and Pierre Soult should have come up from\r\nthe south. And the Madrid column was not due on the Douro for two more\r\ndays, owing to its late start--no fault of its own, but due to Gazan’s\r\ndilatory conduct on May 24th.\r\n\r\nLeval had only got the order to evacuate the capital on the 26th.\r\nLuckily for him Maransin had come in with his flying column from\r\nToledo on the 21st, so that there was no need to wait to pick up this\r\ndetachment. The garrison was directed to be under arms for marching\r\nat daybreak on the 27th, and with them went a considerable train of\r\n_Afrancesado_ refugees, for many of Joseph’s ministers and courtiers\r\nhad refused to start by the earlier convoys, which had gone to\r\nValladolid in March and April, hoping that emigration might never again\r\nbecome necessary. The remembrance of the miserable march to Valencia\r\nin July 1812 weighed on their minds, and made them unwilling to face\r\na second _hegira_ of the same sort. Now all had to go; and quantities\r\nof carriages, carts, wagons, and mules belonging to civilians were\r\nmixed with, or trailed behind, the columns of Leval’s infantry. The\r\nconvoy could not travel very fast; it only reached the foot of the\r\nmountains on the night of the 27th, crossed the Guadarrama pass on the\r\n28th, and reached Espinar on the northern descent on the 29th. Here\r\nLeval turned off the baggage and refugees on to the road of Segovia,\r\nunder charge of an escort commanded by General Hugo, late Governor of\r\nMadrid. He himself with the fighting men went on to Arevalo by the\r\ngreat _chaussée_, reached the Douro on the 2nd of June, and joined\r\nGazan at Tordesillas. The latter had crossed the river on May 31st, the\r\nmoment that it became clear that the Madrid column was not going to be\r\nintercepted by any British force from the Salamanca direction. D’Erlon\r\npassed the Douro only on June 2, the same day as Leval, having waited\r\nbehind to cover the arrival of the column of refugees and transport\r\nfrom Madrid, which had been directed on Segovia and Cuellar.\r\n\r\nOn June 2nd therefore the south bank of the Douro had been at last\r\nevacuated by all the French forces, but Jourdan’s and Joseph’s plan for\r\ndefending the northern bank was obviously out of date and impossible.\r\nFor Wellington was already at Toro with Graham’s 40,000 men, and there\r\nwas no means of preventing Hill’s 30,000 and the Galicians from joining\r\nhim north of the river. The Salamanca column, if only the French had\r\nknown it, was already marching north, to fall in alongside of the other\r\nand larger mass of the allied army, and was due at Toro next day (June\r\n3rd).\r\n\r\nThis last fact was, of course, unknown at French head-quarters on the\r\nafternoon of June 2nd--all that had transpired was that Wellington\r\nwas at Toro with a very large force, and the Galicians close by his\r\nflank on the Benavente road. The exact position of the imperial\r\narmy was that Gazan, with four and a half infantry divisions of the\r\nArmy of the South and all the cavalry of Digeon, Tilly, and Pierre\r\nSoult, was concentrated on a ten-mile front between Tordesillas and\r\nTorrelobaton: Reille, with Darmagnac’s division and Boyer’s cavalry,\r\nwas at Medina de Rio Seco, twelve miles farther north. D’Erlon, with\r\nCassagne’s division and Treillard’s dragoons, was at Valladolid,\r\nfifteen miles behind Tordesillas; the King and his Guards at Cigales,\r\nten miles north of D’Erlon, twelve miles east of Reille. Maucune’s two\r\nbrigades had at last concentrated at Palencia--some 25 miles north of\r\nValladolid. There was now a very solid mass of troops, which could be\r\nunited at one spot--Torrelobaton for example--by a concentric march,\r\ntaking up one day, or could on the other hand string itself out in\r\na well closed-up front behind the Carrion and Pisuerga rivers, from\r\nPalencia to Simancas, to defend the line of those streams. The force\r\nwas formidable--over 40,000 bayonets, quite 10,000 sabres. It was\r\nphysically possible either to mass and offer Wellington a battle, or\r\nto stand fast to defend the line of the Pisuerga. But would either\r\ncourse be prudent, considering that Hill could join Wellington with\r\nease at Toro, so that the entire Anglo-Portuguese army could be\r\nconcentrated for a general action, not to speak of the Galicians of\r\nGiron on his flank? Exact calculations as to the allied strength were\r\nimpossible--but it would certainly exceed 70,000 men: some of the\r\nFrench generals put it at 90,000. To engage in an open battle west of\r\nthe Pisuerga against such superior numbers would be insane. But what\r\nof the idea of taking up a defensive line east of that river, in the\r\nhope of rallying Foy, Clausel, and other outlying forces within a week\r\nor ten days? Marmont had done well with his position behind a river in\r\nJuly 1812, and had only been ruined at Salamanca because he had left\r\nhis strong line and attacked with insufficient numbers.\r\n\r\nThere was much debate at head-quarters on the afternoon of June 2.\r\nSeveral policies were discussed, even, as it would appear, a desperate\r\nsuggestion of Jourdan’s to bring the whole army back southward across\r\nthe Douro, to Medina del Campo and Olmedo, and defy Wellington to\r\ncross its front so as to cut the Burgos road and the communication\r\nwith France. ‘It is doubtful whether Wellington would have dared to\r\ncontinue his march to the Carrion, and to abandon his line of connexion\r\nwith Portugal,’ writes Jourdan; ‘more probably he would have repassed\r\nthe Douro, to follow the French army, which could then have retired\r\nup-stream to Aranda, and from thence either on Burgos or on Saragossa.\r\nTime would have been gained--Clausel would have come up, and we could\r\nhave fought on ground more suitable for cavalry[491].’ This most\r\nhazardous plan would have commenced by abandoning to the enemy all\r\nOld Castile and Biscay, with the French forces scattered in them; for\r\neven if Wellington had followed the King with his Anglo-Portuguese\r\narmy, Giron’s Galicians and the insurgents of the North--Longa,\r\nPorlier, El Pastor, and the rest--would have been left free to clear\r\nthe whole country up to the Pyrenees. The French detachments in the\r\nNorth must have retired on Bayonne. King Joseph and the generals\r\nrejected the scheme at once, on the ground that Napoleon’s orders had\r\nalways insisted on the retention of the direct road to France, by\r\nBurgos and Vittoria, as the most important of all considerations. This\r\nwas undoubtedly a correct decision. Not only was the road along the\r\nsouth bank of the Douro to Aranda a very bad one, through an exhausted\r\ncountry, but it is clear that, if they took it, the French would never\r\nhave got back again on to the Burgos line, but would have been forced\r\nto take the Saragossa line. The way from Aranda by Soria to Saragossa\r\nwas through a rough country infested by Duran, the Empecinado, and\r\nother active guerrillero leaders. It could never have served as the\r\nmain artery of communication for an army of the size of King Joseph’s.\r\nBut supposing that the King should have reached Saragossa, his only\r\ntouch with France would be through Barcelona and Roussillon, for\r\nthere is no decent carriage road from Saragossa across the Central\r\nPyrenees--the difficult pass by Jaca having often been tried and found\r\nwanting, save for small and unencumbered detachments. To base the\r\nwhole army of Spain on Perpignan instead of Bayonne would have been\r\nhopelessly impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether the line along the Pisuerga, from Palencia\r\nto opposite Simancas, could not be held was the really hard problem. It\r\nwas 35 miles long, well marked, but with local faults; the water was\r\nlow; there were points where the west bank commanded the east; from\r\nnear Palencia to Cabezon the only good road was on the western side of\r\nthe river, and so out of control; while the bad path on the eastern\r\nside was cut up by three streams coming in from the high plateaux of\r\nthe province of Burgos. In the rear there was the defile of Torquemada,\r\nwhere the road and the Pisuerga itself came out of the upland. After\r\npondering over the question, Joseph decided that the Pisuerga was too\r\ndangerous a line to hold, that he was still too weak in numbers, and\r\nthat he had better fall back on Burgos, and wait in position there, on\r\nground much more defensible than the broad plains of the Pisuerga and\r\nthe Carrion, for the arrival of the missing divisions of the Army of\r\nPortugal and of Clausel.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 2nd orders were issued that all the _impedimenta_\r\nof the Army of Spain should move off northward at once. The Grand Park\r\nand other transport, the Spanish refugees with all their carriages and\r\nlumber, the French civil administrators, the King’s ministers with his\r\nprivate baggage and treasure, and much miscellaneous stuff from the\r\nroyal palaces--pictures, books, and antiquities--were to start off\r\nat once on the road to Burgos. One great convoy was dispatched that\r\nnight, a second and still larger one the following morning. Escort was\r\nfound for them from the King’s Spanish troops, the so-called ‘division’\r\nof Casa Palacios, and other detachments, making up 4,000 men in all.\r\nOn the afternoon of the 3rd the army executed a general movement of\r\nretreat, leaving only a cavalry screen behind, to observe Wellington’s\r\nadvance. The Army of the South came back through Valladolid, after\r\nblowing up all the bridges on the lower Pisuerga and the neighbouring\r\nstreams, and then marched up its western bank to Cabezon. Reille\r\nevacuated Medina de Rio Seco and fell back on Palencia, where he picked\r\nup Maucune. Head-quarters and the King’s guard moved to Magaz, just\r\nsouth of Palencia. D’Erlon marched from Valladolid to Dueñas, ten\r\nmiles farther south than Magaz, and made ready to blow up the bridge\r\nthere and cross to the other side of the Pisuerga. The whole army was\r\ncollected in a space of 15 miles, and halted for two days, in a safe\r\nposition for retreat on Burgos, when it should be pressed. For Joseph\r\nand Jourdan naturally wished to gain time--every day that passed made\r\nit more likely that the missing divisions from the North would be\r\nheard of, or even be reported as approaching. Yet it would seem that\r\neven yet no direct and peremptory orders had been sent to Clausel, for\r\nJourdan writes in his Memoirs that ‘the King suspended the retrograde\r\nmovement because he thought to gain time, _and hoped that the Minister\r\nof War would have given orders to General Clauzel to come down on\r\nBurgos_[492].’ Again the wretched system of double-command and constant\r\nreference to Paris was working! If it be remembered that it was only on\r\nthe 18th of May that the King had made his final appeal to the minister\r\nto let loose Clausel from the northern operations, and that the news\r\nof Wellington’s actual advance had only been sent to France on the\r\n24th, when could it be expected that the directions from Paris would\r\nreach the scattered columns lost in the mountains of Navarre? And was\r\nthere any certainty that Clarke would visualize the full danger of the\r\nposition, and give at once the kind of orders that the King desired?\r\nHe might send instead a lecture on the Emperor’s intentions, if past\r\nexperience was to be trusted, and some suggestions which the events of\r\nthe last ten days would have put completely out of date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS AROUND BURGOS: JUNE 4-14, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 3rd Wellington had halted the infantry of Graham’s column at\r\nToro, in order to allow the whole of Hill’s column to cross the bridge\r\nand fords, and to complete the junction of the army. He gave as his\r\nreasons that he expected to meet Gazan, D’Erlon, and the King, on the\r\nHormija river, when he should have debouched from Toro, and that he\r\nintended to fight them with his whole force, not with the northern\r\ncolumn only. ‘I do not think,’ he wrote, ‘that we are so close up\r\nor so well concentrated as we ought to be, to meet the enemy in the\r\nstrength in which he will appear on the Hormija, probably to-morrow;\r\nand therefore I propose to halt the heads of the different columns\r\nto-morrow, and close up the rear of each, moving Hill in this direction\r\npreparatory to our further movement[493].’ Only the cavalry continued\r\nto press forward on the 3rd; they found no signs of resistance, but\r\nonly vedettes, which retired cautiously on their approach. Wellington\r\nwas so far right in his apprehension, that the idea of fighting in\r\nfront of Valladolid had been one of the three plans which the French\r\nHead-quarters Staff had considered on June 2. But, as we have already\r\nseen, that scheme had been rejected as rash, and during Wellington’s\r\nhalt upon June 3 the enemy were evacuating Valladolid and all its\r\nneighbourhood, and commencing their retreat behind the Pisuerga. By\r\neight o’clock on the evening of that day the cavalry reports, all\r\nalong the front, showed that the enemy was retiring on every road,\r\nand it appeared certain that they did not intend to fight; the army\r\ntherefore advanced in three main columns, Wellington himself with\r\nthe 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th Divisions, followed by Hill, by the high\r\nroad on Valladolid through La Mota: Graham with the 1st and 5th\r\nDivisions, Pack and Bradford, by the more northern parallel road, by\r\nVillavelid and Villar de Frades, on Medina de Rio Seco. The Galicians\r\nwere converging on the same point as Graham, by the high road from\r\nVillalpando and Villafrechos, but were directed not to approach too\r\nclose to Medina till further notice. The reason for their delay was a\r\ncurious one--Giron had just written on the previous day to say that\r\nhe had no reserve of infantry cartridges, and only 60 rounds a man in\r\nthe soldiers’ pouches. He wanted to borrow a supply from the British\r\narmy. Wellington replied in considerable heat: when he was on the move\r\nhe could not give away his own reserve ammunition: no doubt Giron\r\nwas not personally to blame--nor his men--but the administration in\r\nGalicia. Yet the unfortunate result would be that the Galicians must\r\nnever be put in a position where there would be a heavy consumption\r\nof cartridges, i. e. must be held in reserve, or used for subsidiary\r\noperations only. Giron was directed to make small regimental reserves,\r\nby taking away a proportion of the cartridges from each man and\r\ncarrying them on mules. The general got off easily--but Wellington\r\nthundered that night on the War Minister O’Donoju, ‘Here is an army\r\nwhich is clothed, armed, and disciplined, but cannot be brought into\r\naction with the enemy: I am obliged to keep it in the rear. How can\r\ntroops march without provisions, or fight without ammunition? The cause\r\nof the country may be lost unless the Government establish in the\r\nprovinces some authority to which the people will pay obedience, and\r\nwhich will insure their resources for the purposes of the war[494].’ It\r\nwill be noted that all through the rest of the campaign Giron’s corps\r\nwas used for flanking movements, and never put in the forefront of the\r\nfighting--though the other Spanish troops with the army, Morillo’s and\r\nlater Longa’s divisions, were used freely.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th June Wellington moved with the ‘Head-Quarters Column’ as\r\nfar as La Mota, Hill getting no farther than Morales. At La Mota\r\nthe information received showed that the French were in general\r\nretreat--the cavalry advance got into Valladolid and found some\r\nundestroyed stores of ammunition there. Julian Sanchez, scouting far\r\ntowards the south, discovered a considerable magazine of grain at\r\nArevalo, where Gazan’s head-quarters had been. In view of the new\r\nsituation it was necessary to recast the movements of the army--there\r\nwas to be no fight on the Hormija, or for the possession of Valladolid.\r\nThe initial strategical success of the passage of the Esla had settled\r\nthe event of the first phase of the campaign, and cleared the French\r\nnot only out of New Castile, but out of the kingdom of Leon and great\r\npart of Old Castile. The fact that the enemy had abandoned Valladolid\r\nand the lower crossings of the Pisuerga, would seem to show that\r\nhe intended to fall back on the Burgos country: he could hardly be\r\nintending to defend a position behind the middle Pisuerga and the\r\nCarrion, since he had surrendered the passages at and about Valladolid,\r\nby which the southern flank of such a position could be turned.\r\n\r\nNow nine months ago Wellington had been in these same regions, with the\r\narmy of Clausel retreating before him from Valladolid on Burgos. On\r\nthat occasion he had followed the enemy in a straightforward pursuit\r\nalong the great high road, by Cabezon and Torquemada. On this occasion\r\nhis strategy was entirely different. Leaving only a cavalry screen\r\nbetween himself and the enemy, he proceeded to move his whole army\r\ntowards the north-west by secondary roads, marching in four parallel\r\ncolumns not on Burgos but on the upper Pisuerga north-west of that\r\nfortress, so as to turn entirely any position that the enemy might\r\ntake up on the Hormaza, the Arlanzon, or the Urbel. It can hardly be\r\ndoubted that he had already in his mind the great manœuvre which he\r\nwas to accomplish during the next fortnight--that of outflanking the\r\nFrench right wing by a wide sweeping movement, which would not only\r\nforce Joseph and Jourdan to evacuate Burgos and its neighbourhood,\r\nbut would cut them off from the royal road to Bayonne and their main\r\ncommunication with France. The first order in his dispatch book which\r\ndefinitely reveals this intention does not appear till June 10[495],\r\nbut the facts which it contains prove that the plan must have been laid\r\nlong ere Wellington started from Portugal.\r\n\r\nThis plan was no less a scheme than the transference of the base of\r\nthe British army from the port of Lisbon to the Bay of Biscay, so that\r\nwhen, in its wide turning movement, it should have passed the Ebro\r\nand neared the Cantabrian coast, it should find stores and munitions\r\nawaiting it, and be no longer tied to the long line of communication\r\nwith Portugal, which it had always used hitherto. It was an astonishing\r\nexample of the strategical use of sea-power, to which there had\r\nhitherto been no parallel in the Napoleonic wars. The only manœuvre at\r\nall resembling it was that by which Sir John Moore in December 1808\r\nhad changed his line of communication from Lisbon to Corunna. But this\r\nwas for a sudden hasty retreat, made by a small army--a very different\r\nthing from an advance made by a large army. For Moore had only wanted\r\ntransports on which to abscond from the Peninsula; Wellington had\r\nplanned the arrival of a fleet of supply vessels, on whose contents\r\nhe was to rely for the future sustenance of his army during a long\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nTheir existence was his second great secret in 1813--the first had been\r\nhis plan for the crossing of the Esla. But the latter might have been\r\nguessed at as a possibility by any intelligent French general: the\r\nformer, it is safe to say, had never been dreamed of as a conceivable\r\nmove. Santander is so remote from Portugal, and the French were so\r\nfirmly rooted in Northern Spain in the spring of 1813, that it could\r\nnever enter into the head of any of Napoleon’s subordinates that the\r\nBritish Commander-in-Chief was planning such an elaborate surprise.\r\nThey were bound to believe that all Wellington’s operations would be\r\nfounded on, and circumscribed by, the basic fact that his line of\r\ncommunication was on Lisbon. A manœuvre which presupposed the complete\r\nabandonment of that line was not conceivable by officers reared in\r\nContinental campaigns, and unused to contemplating the correlation of\r\nland operations and naval strategy. Yet the fact that the supply fleet\r\nhad been gathered at Corunna long weeks before, and kept there till\r\nthe conquest of Northern Spain was well on its way to completion, is\r\nconclusive evidence as to Wellington’s intentions. The crucial dispatch\r\nof June 10 ran as follows--it was addressed to Colonel Bourke in charge\r\nof the British dépôts in Galicia:\r\n\r\n‘There are at Corunna certain ships loaded with biscuit and flour,\r\nand certain others loaded with a train of heavy artillery and its\r\nammunition, and some with musket ammunition, and I shall be much\r\nobliged if you will request any officer of the navy who may be at\r\nCorunna, when you receive this letter, to take under his convoy all\r\nthe vessels loaded as above mentioned, and to proceed with them to\r\nSantander. If he should find Santander occupied by the enemy, I beg him\r\nto remain off the port till the operations of this army have obliged\r\nthe enemy to abandon it.\r\n\r\n‘If the enemy is not occupying Santander, I beg him to enter the port,\r\nbut to be in readiness to quit it again if the enemy should approach\r\nthe place, until I shall communicate with him[496]’.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Wellington had carefully avoided calling\r\nattention to the accumulation of ships and stores at Corunna, even\r\nin his letters to the ministers at home[497]. Their existence there\r\nwas plausibly explained by the need for supplying the Spanish army of\r\nGalicia--which had indeed received much material during the spring.\r\nThe provision of heavy artillery shows that he was contemplating\r\nas a probability the siege of San Sebastian and the other northern\r\nfortresses. He had failed at Burgos in 1812 for lack of the 24-pounders\r\nwhich Home Popham had vainly offered to send him from Santander: now he\r\nwas quite ready to receive them from that port. As things stood on the\r\nPisuerga, at the moment that he sent this prescient dispatch to Bourke,\r\nit was certainly a bold prophecy to write that he was about to clear\r\nthe Cantabrian coast by his next move. The French were still unbeaten,\r\nand he was more than a hundred miles from the Bay of Biscay, from which\r\nhe was separated by a most rough and complicated land of mountains.\r\nBut he had already taken his measure of the capacity of the hostile\r\ncommanders, and his hopes were high.\r\n\r\nThe great flank movement’s initial stages can be best traced by\r\nfollowing on the map Wellington’s nightly head-quarters. They were\r\nLa Mota on the 4th, Castromonte on the 5th, Ampudia on the 6th--all\r\nthese carefully avoid the neighbourhood of the Pisuerga, though the\r\ncavalry pushed on to feel the lines of the French along the river.\r\nBut the army, instead of making for the crossings at Valladolid,\r\nCabezon, or Dueñas, kept steadily on in four parallel columns, on\r\nroads far from the river. Hill, still as always on the right, went by\r\nTorrelobaton, Mucientes, and Dueñas; Graham, on the left, by Medina\r\nde Rio Seco and Grixota; ‘the Head-Quarters Column’ under Wellington\r\nhimself, by Castromonte and Ampudia--while, far off, the Galician army\r\non the north moved by Villaramiel and Villoldo on Aguilar de Campos.\r\nThe flanking cavalry kept up a continual bickering along the Pisuerga\r\nwith French outposts; on the 6th those at the head of the advance had a\r\ndistant glimpse of a great review of the Army of the Centre, which King\r\nJoseph was holding outside Palencia, from the heights which overlook\r\nthat city from the west. In front of Dueñas there was an exchange of\r\nletters under a flag of truce between Wellington and Gazan--a most\r\nodd proceeding at such a moment--from which both parties thought they\r\nhad derived useful information[498]. The British _parlementaire_\r\nreported to the Commander-in-Chief that Dueñas was still held by French\r\ninfantry--which was good to know: the French, on the other hand, got a\r\nreply to Gazan’s letter to Wellington within four hours--which proved\r\nthat British Head-Quarters must be a very short way from them--which\r\nwas equally a valuable scrap of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe King had now waited three days in the temporary position behind\r\nthe Pisuerga, without being attacked, though he was in the close\r\nneighbourhood of the enemy. The quiescence of such an adversary made\r\nhim uncomfortable, and at last he guessed part of what was going on\r\nopposite him. The British must be pushing up northward parallel to his\r\nline, and preparing to turn his right flank (which extended no farther\r\nthan Palencia) by way of Amusco and the upper Carrion. Whereupon Joseph\r\non the 7th hastily resumed his retreat, and got behind the defile of\r\nTorquemada. There was danger in waiting--nothing had been heard of\r\nClausel, but news were to hand that Lamartinière, with one of the\r\nmissing divisions of the Army of Portugal, was nearing Burgos from\r\nthe north. The main body took post on the Arlanzon--but Reille with\r\nhis two divisions at Castroxeriz on the Odra. Jourdan went forward to\r\nreport on the condition of Burgos, where important new works had been\r\ncommenced in the spring, and to choose good defensible positions in its\r\nneighbourhood. It was expected that the British army would follow in\r\npursuit, up the great _chaussée_ from Palencia to Torquemada.\r\n\r\nAnd at first it looked as if this might be the case: entering Palencia\r\non the same day that the King had left it, Wellington pushed up the\r\n_chaussée_ part of Hill’s column--Grant’s and Ponsonby’s cavalry\r\nbrigades and the Light Division, which kept in touch with the enemy’s\r\nrear. The rest of the right column had got no farther forward than\r\nPalencia. But the main body of the army continued its north-westerly\r\nturning movement, Graham’s infantry that day reached Grixota, five\r\nmiles north of Palencia; the Galicians were up parallel with Graham\r\nfarther west, somewhere near Becceril. The movements of June 8 and 9,\r\nhowever, were the decisive revelations of Wellington’s intentions.\r\nHe moved his head-quarters not up the Torquemada road, but to Amusco\r\non the Carrion river, and continued to urge his columns straight\r\nnorthward--Graham to San Cebrian and Peña on the 8th and Osorno on the\r\n9th, the main body of Hill’s column to Amusco and Tamara, the Galicians\r\nto Carrion. He was thus getting his army well north of any positions\r\nwhich the enemy would be likely to take up in the neighbourhood of\r\nBurgos, giving it very long marches, but still keeping it closely\r\nconcentrated.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th he judged that he had got sufficiently round the enemy, and\r\nturned all his columns due east towards the upper Pisuerga--Graham’s\r\nand Wellington’s own divisions crossing it at Zarzosa and Melgar, Hill\r\nat Astudillo, some miles farther south. Head-quarters were fixed that\r\nnight at Melgar. With the passage of the Pisuerga ended the long march\r\nthrough the great flat corn-bearing plainland of Northern Spain, the\r\nTierra de Campos. The next ten days were to be spent among rougher\r\npaths. The triumphant and almost unopposed advance from the Esla to the\r\nPisuerga, executed in one sweep and at high speed, was an episode which\r\nthose who were engaged in it never forgot.\r\n\r\n‘From the time of our crossing the Esla up to this period,’ wrote one\r\ndiarist, ‘we have been marching through one continuous cornfield. The\r\nland is of the richest quality, and produces the finest crops with the\r\nleast possible labour. It is generally wheat, with a fair proportion\r\nof barley, and now and then a crop of vetches or clover. The horses\r\nfed on green barley nearly the whole march, and got fat. The army has\r\ntrampled down twenty yards of corn on each side of the roads by which\r\nthe several columns have passed--in many places much more, from the\r\nbaggage going on the side of the columns, and so spreading farther into\r\nthe wheat. But they must not mind their corn if we get the enemy out\r\nof their country!... The country gives bread and corn, and hitherto\r\nthese have not failed, and this is a region that has been plundered and\r\ndevastated for five years by the enemy! It was said before our march\r\nthat until the harvest came in, not a pound of bread by way of supplies\r\nfor the army could be procured[499].’\r\n\r\nA Light Division diarist writes in a more romantic frame of mind: ‘The\r\ncountry was beautifully diversified, studded with castles of Moorish\r\narchitecture, recalling the chivalric days of Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\nThe sun shone brilliantly, the sky was heavenly blue, and clouds of\r\ndust marked the line of march of the glittering columns. The joyous\r\npeasantry hailed our approach and came dancing to meet us, singing, and\r\nbeating time on their small tambourines; and when we passed through the\r\nprincipal street of Palencia, the nuns, from the upper windows of a\r\nconvent, showered down rose-leaves upon our dusty heads[500].’\r\n\r\nThe dry comment of the Commander-in-chief, in his report to the War\r\nMinister at home, contrasts oddly with this enthusiasm: ‘I enclose the\r\nlast weekly and daily states. We keep up our strength, and the army are\r\nvery healthy and in better order than I have ever known them. God knows\r\nhow long that will last. It depends entirely upon the officers[501].’\r\n\r\nWhile Wellington’s columns were hurrying northward, the French remained\r\nfor two days (June 7-9) in position behind the Pisuerga--Reille on the\r\nright at Castroxeriz, the rest of the army holding the heights down to\r\nVilladiego and the Arlanza river. Only British cavalry scouts appeared\r\nin front of them. ‘The position was excellent,’ says Jourdan, ‘and it\r\nwas hoped to hold it for some days. But the generals commanding the\r\narmies represented to the King that the troops lacked bread, and that\r\nthey dared not send out large detachments far afield to requisition\r\nfood from the peasantry, wherefore the whole force retired on Burgos.’\r\nNo doubt the country was bare; and, when the enemy is known to be\r\nnear, it is unsafe to make large detachments: but it may be suspected\r\nthat the real cause for retreat was the continuous uncertainty as\r\nto Wellington’s northward movement. Yet it is clear that the French\r\nHead-Quarters had no suspicion how far that movement was going.\r\n\r\nFor on the 9th, when they retreated, they took up position on a very\r\nshort line north and south of Burgos. Reille’s two divisions lay behind\r\nthe Hormaza river, ten miles west of the fortress--with the right\r\nopposite Hormaza village, the left at Estepar--forming a front line.\r\nThe Army of the South was on both banks of the Arlanzon, five miles\r\nbehind Reille--right wing behind the Urbel river, left wing behind\r\nthe Arcos river. The Army of the Centre and the King’s Guards were in\r\nreserve, billeted in Burgos itself. But already Wellington’s columns\r\nwere aiming at points far north of Reille’s position. That day the\r\nnorthernmost divisions of Graham’s infantry[502] were at Osorno, next\r\nday (June 10th) at Zarzosa, beyond the Pisuerga, a point from which\r\nthey could easily march round the Hormaza position, and on June 11th,\r\nat Sotresgudo, where they halted for a day[503]. The centre[504],\r\nwith Wellington himself, on the same day had reached Castroxeriz on\r\nthe Odra river, while Hill was close by at Barrio de Santa Maria and\r\nValbases. Nothing had been sent south of the Arlanzon save Julian\r\nSanchez’s lancers, who were scouring the country in the direction of\r\nLerma, on the look-out for belated French convoys or detachments.\r\nThe Galician army, keeping (as always) far out on the left wing, had\r\nreached the Pisuerga at Herrera, ten miles north of Graham’s extreme\r\nflank. They were now within two marches of the upper Ebro, and there\r\nwas absolutely no enemy in front of them for scores of miles--the\r\nnearest Frenchmen in that direction were the columns with which Foy was\r\nscouring the roads of Biscay, after his capture of Castro-Urdiales.\r\n\r\nThe halt of the French army in the neighbourhood of Burgos was not\r\nto mark the end of its retreat, and the commencement of offensive\r\noperations, as King Joseph had hoped. The only cheering features\r\nin the general outlook were that Lamartinière’s division of the\r\nArmy of Portugal was now in touch--it was reported coming up from\r\nBriviesca--and that a bulletin of the Grand Army was received from\r\nGermany, telling of the victory of the Emperor at Bautzen. But the\r\ndiscouraging news was appalling--the first instalment of it was that\r\nJourdan reported, after investigating the fortifications of Burgos,\r\nthat he considered the place untenable. During the spring building and\r\ndemolition had been taken in hand, for the purpose of linking up the\r\nold castle, which had given so much trouble to Wellington in 1812,\r\nwith the high-lying ‘Hornwork of St. Miguel’ on the rising ground\r\nabove. The scheme was wholly unfinished--the only result achieved was\r\nthat St. Miguel, as reconstructed, commanded the castle, and that the\r\nalterations started in the _enceinte_ of the latter, with the object\r\nof linking it up with the former, had rendered it, in the marshal’s\r\nopinion, incapable of holding out for a day. Yet this would not have\r\nmattered so much if the army had been about to resume the offensive, or\r\nto put up a stable defence in the Burgos region.\r\n\r\nBut it was declared that this was impossible--the governor reported\r\nthat the immense convoys which had been passing through Burgos of late,\r\nand the recent stay of considerable bodies of troops in the place[505],\r\nhad brought his magazines to such a low ebb that he could not feed\r\nan army of 50,000 men for more than a few days. The town was still\r\ncrammed with the last great horde of Spanish and French refugees, who\r\nhad come on from Madrid, Segovia, and Valladolid, and all the King’s\r\nprivate train. They were sent on at once towards Vittoria, under escort\r\nof Lamartinière’s division--which thus no sooner became available\r\nthan it was lost again. No news had arrived either from Foy or from\r\nClausel: but Sarrut’s division of the Army of Portugal had been located\r\nnorth of the Ebro, and would be coming in ere very long. The news\r\nthat Clausel was undiscoverable brought King Joseph to such a pitch\r\nof excitement that he took, on June 9th, a step which he should have\r\ntaken a fortnight before, and threw over all his fears of offending the\r\nminister at Paris or the Emperor in Saxony. He sent direct peremptory\r\norders to Clausel to join him at once, and told off a column of 1,500\r\nmen to escort the aide-de-camp who bore them: it went off by Domingo\r\nCalzada and Logroño. As a matter of fact the order reached the general\r\nin six days--but it might have taken longer for all that Joseph could\r\nguess. And the King came to the conclusion that if he were at all\r\npushed by Wellington within the next few days, he must abandon Burgos\r\nand retire behind the Ebro. He might even have to go without hostile\r\npersuasion, on the mere question of food-supplies.\r\n\r\nBut on June 12 the pressure was applied. Wellington had now got all\r\nhis forces over the Pisuerga, and his two southern columns were\r\nconcentrated between Castroxeriz and Villadiego: Graham was farther\r\noff, but not out of reach. Having reconnoitred the advanced position\r\nof Reille on the Hormaza river, and found that his supports were far\r\nbehind, he resolved to attack him in front and flank that morning. Only\r\nthe southern column--Hill’s troops--was employed, the centre divisions\r\nbeing halted in a position from which they might be brought in on the\r\nenemy’s rear, if the King reinforced Reille, but not if the French\r\nshowed no signs of standing. But the push against the Army of Portugal,\r\nmade by the 2nd Division, Silveira’s Portuguese, and Morillo’s\r\nSpaniards, was sufficient to dislodge the enemy: for while they were\r\ndeploying against the French front, the cavalry brigades of Grant and\r\nPonsonby, supported by the Light Division, appeared behind Reille’s\r\nright flank. The enemy at once gave way, before infantry fighting had\r\nbegun, and retreating hastily southward got behind the Urbel river,\r\nwhere the Army of the South was already in line. Reille then crossed\r\nthe Arlanzon by the bridge of Buniel and took post south of Burgos.\r\nThe French loss was small--the retreat was made in good order and with\r\ngreat speed, before the British infantry could arrive. Grant’s and\r\nPonsonby’s horse, already outflanking the rearguard, got in close, but\r\ndid not deliver a general attack--by Wellington’s own orders as it\r\nis said[506]: for (despite of Garcia Hernandez) he held to his firm\r\nbelief that cavalry cannot break intact infantry. A half troop of the\r\n14th Light Dragoons, under Lieut. Southwell, charged and captured an\r\nisolated French gun, which had fallen behind the rearguard; but this\r\nwas the only contact between the armies that day. Jourdan says that\r\nReille lost about fifteen men only--an exaggeration no doubt, but not a\r\nvery great one.\r\n\r\nThe result, however, was to determine King Joseph to retreat at once,\r\nand to abandon Burgos, before his obviously outflanked right wing\r\nshould be entirely circumvented. That night desperate measures were\r\ntaken--everything that could travel on wheels was sent off by the high\r\nroad towards the Ebro: the infantry followed, using such side roads as\r\nwere available. At dawn only cavalry rearguards were covering Burgos.\r\nJourdan explains the haste of the retreat as follows. ‘It was easy to\r\nforesee that next morning that part of the Army of the South which lay\r\nbehind the Urbel river would be attacked, and that being separated by\r\nthe Arlanzon from the bulk of the army, which lay on the south bank, it\r\nwould be compromised. Three choices lay open--first, to bring the whole\r\narmy across the Arlanzon and to fight on the Urbel; but this would have\r\nbrought on the general action which it had been determined to avoid,\r\never since the King had made up his mind to call in Clausel. Second--to\r\nbring the whole army across to the south bank of the Arlanzon, where\r\nthere was a good position: but this move would have allowed the enemy\r\nto cut the great road and our communications with France--and the same\r\nmotives which had caused the rejection of the scheme to retire south of\r\nthe Douro on June 2 caused this alternative to be disapproved on June\r\n12. Third--to fall back by the great road to the Ebro, and so secure\r\nthe earliest possible concentration of all the armies of Spain. This\r\nwas the scheme adopted[507].’\r\n\r\nIt is said that Gazan was for fighting on the Urbel[508], while Reille\r\nand D’Erlon opted for the second choice--that of abandoning the high\r\nroad to France, going south of the Arlanzon, and retreating by the bad\r\ntrack to Domingo Calzada and Logroño, because Clausel, being certainly\r\nsomewhere in Navarre, would be picked up much sooner at Logroño than at\r\nMiranda or other points higher up the Ebro. But the Emperor’s orders\r\nthat the direct communication with France must be kept up at all costs,\r\nwere adduced against them, and settled the question.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, the French made arrangements to blow up the castle\r\nwhich had served them so well in the preceding October, and to destroy\r\na great store of powder and munitions for which no transport could be\r\nprocured. According to Jourdan the disaster which followed was due to\r\nthe professional ignorance of General d’Aboville, the director-general\r\nof artillery, who maintained that shells would do no great harm if\r\nthey were exploded, not in a great mass but placed in small groups, at\r\ndistances one from another. He had 6,000 of them laid in parcels on\r\nthe ground in the castle square, and connected with the mines which\r\nwere placed under the donjon keep. Orders were given that the fuses\r\nwere only to be lit when the last troops should have left, and the\r\ninhabitants were told that if they would keep to their houses they\r\nwould incur no danger. But the mines by some error were fired before\r\nseven o’clock in the morning, and the effects of the explosion had\r\nbeen so badly calculated, that not only were many houses in the city\r\ninjured, all the glass blown out of the splendid cathedral, and its\r\nroof broken in several places, but a hail of shells fell all over the\r\nsurrounding quarter, and killed 100 men of Villatte’s division, who\r\nwere halted in the Plaza Mayor, and a few of Digeon’s dragoons who were\r\ncrossing the bridge[509]. There were casualties also, of course, among\r\nthe unfortunate citizens. When the smoke cleared away, and the fire\r\nhad gone out, it was found that the destruction of the donjon keep and\r\nupper works of the castle had been complete, but that most of the outer\r\nwall was standing--as indeed it is to this day. Wellington remarked\r\nthat it was quite capable of restoration, if the fortunes of the war\r\nmade it necessary[510]. They did not; and the skeleton of the castle\r\nstill remains ruined and riven on its mound, to surprise the observer\r\nby its moderate size. Those who go round it can only marvel that such a\r\nsmall fortress should have held all Wellington’s army at bay during so\r\nmany eventful days in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe British general, hearing at Castroxeriz, on the early morning of\r\nJune 13, that the French had evacuated Burgos and blown up its works,\r\ndid not even enter the town, and sent nothing more than cavalry scouts\r\nto follow the retreating enemy, but ordered the instant resumption of\r\nthe north-westward march of the whole army. It was now his intention\r\nto turn the line of the Ebro, in the same fashion that he had turned\r\nthe line of the Douro on May 31--by passing it so far to the westward\r\nthat any position which the enemy might adopt would be outflanked, even\r\nbefore it was fully taken up. And he was aiming not only at turning the\r\nEbro line, but at cutting Joseph’s communication with France: he was\r\nalready taking Vittoria, far behind the Ebro, as the goal for which he\r\nwas making.\r\n\r\nWe have Wellington’s own word for the fact that it was the collapse\r\nof the French opposition in front of Burgos which finally induced him\r\nto develop his original plan of campaign, spoken of above, into the\r\nmore ambitious scheme for driving the French completely out of the\r\nPeninsula, which he now took in hand. Unfortunately his statement was\r\ntaken down many years after the event, and his memory of details was\r\nnot all that it might have been in his old age. But the story is so\r\ninteresting and fits into the psychology of the moment so well that it\r\nmust not be omitted.\r\n\r\n‘When I heard and saw the explosion (I was within a few miles, and\r\nthe effect was tremendous) I made a sudden resolution forthwith--to\r\ncross the Ebro _instanter_, and to endeavour to push the French to the\r\nPyrenees. We had heard of the battles of Lützen and Bautzen, and of\r\nthe Armistice, and the affairs of the Allies looked very ill. Some of\r\nmy officers remonstrated with me about the imprudence of crossing the\r\nEbro, and advised me to “take up the line of the Ebro”, &c. I asked\r\nthem what they meant by “taking up the line of the Ebro”,--a river 300\r\nmiles long, and what good I was to do along that line? In short I would\r\nnot listen to that advice, and that evening (or the very next morning)\r\nI crossed the river and pushed the French till I afterwards beat them\r\nat Vittoria. And lucky it was that I did! For the battle of Vittoria\r\ninduced the Allies to denounce the Armistice--then followed Leipzig and\r\nall the rest.\r\n\r\n‘All my staff were against my crossing the Ebro: they represented that\r\nwe had done enough, that we ought not to risk the army and all that we\r\nhad obtained, that the Armistice would enable Bonaparte to reinforce\r\nhis army in Spain, and we therefore should look for a defensive system.\r\nI thought differently--I knew that the Armistice could not affect in\r\nthe way of quick reinforcement so distant an army as that of Spain. I\r\nthought that if I could not _hustle_ them out of Spain before they were\r\nreinforced, I should not be able to hold any position in Spain after\r\nthey should be. Above all I calculated on the effect that a victory\r\nmight have on the Armistice itself, so I crossed the Ebro and fought\r\nthe battle of Vittoria.’\r\n\r\nHow far is this curious confidence, made to Croker in January 1837, and\r\ntaken down by him in two separate drafts (_Croker Papers_, ii. p. 309,\r\nand iii. pp. 336-7), a blurred impression, coloured by after events? It\r\nis quite true that the Burgos explosion took place early on the morning\r\nof June 13, that the orders dictated at Villadiego that day (_Suppl.\r\nDisp._ vii, p. 637) give a sudden new direction to the army, and that\r\nnext evening (June 14) the heads of the columns were over the Ebro. But\r\nWellington’s own dispatches seem to show that he did not know anything\r\nof the Armistice on June 13, for he wrote to his brother Henry that\r\nday, ‘I have no news from England. The French have a bulletin of May\r\n24th, when Napoleon was at Dresden--they talk of successes, but as he\r\nwas still at Dresden on the 24th, having arrived there on the 8th, they\r\ncannot have been very important.’ Now the Armistice of Plässwitz was\r\nsigned on June 4, and on the 13th Wellington’s latest news was of May\r\n24. But on the 17th, when he had been two days across the Ebro, he did\r\nat last hear something. Again he writes to his brother:\r\n\r\n‘I have got, by Corunna, English papers of the 3rd. There were several\r\nactions in the neighbourhood of Bautzen on the 20th-22nd May....\r\nBonaparte turned then, and they retired. The Allies have lost ground\r\nbut are unhurt. He has offered (before the battle) to consent to a\r\ncongress at Prague.... An armistice is to commence when the ministers\r\nshall arrive at Prague.... I do not think that the Russians and\r\nPrussians can agree to the armistice, unless they submit entirely’\r\n(_Disp._ x. p. 443).\r\n\r\nClearly, then, Wellington on the 13th knew nothing of any armistice,\r\nsince he introduces the proposal, not the accomplishment, of it to\r\nhis most trusted correspondent on the 17th, as the last news to hand.\r\nHe was committed to the advance on Vittoria long before he could\r\nknow of its subsequent political effects. And thus in his old age he\r\nunderrated his own prescience. But the fact that his officers doubted\r\nthe wisdom of the advance, and that he swept their objections away, is\r\nprobably correct. That he had considered the possibility of an advance\r\nfar beyond the Ebro seems, as has been said before (pp. 301-3), to be\r\nproved by orders given in the spring, before the campaign began.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 13th head-quarters were at Villadiego, while the\r\ncolumns were all heading northward on parallel routes. The Galicians\r\nwere moving from Aguilar on the bridge of Rocamonde[511], the highest\r\non the Ebro save that at its source near Reynosa. The bulk of Graham’s\r\ncolumn was marching by La Piedra on the bridge of San Martin, a\r\nfew miles lower down than Rocamonde, though some of its flanking\r\ncavalry crossed at the latter passage, ahead of the Galicians. The\r\nHead-Quarters divisions and Hill’s column moved, using all available\r\nsecondary roads, from their position opposite the lower Urbel, by\r\nVilladiego and Montorio respectively, on the bridge of Puente Arenas,\r\nsome fifteen miles below that of San Martin. All three columns had on\r\nthe 13th-14th-15th very hard marches, of four long Spanish leagues\r\non three successive days, across upland roads where artillery had\r\nnever been seen before. The move would only have been practicable at\r\nmidsummer. But the columns were absolutely unopposed, and the upper\r\nEbro country had been entirely neglected by the French, as Wellington\r\nhad foreseen. ‘One division could have stopped the whole column at the\r\nbridge of San Martin,’ wrote an intelligent observer, ‘or the other at\r\nRocamonde, where some of our column likewise crossed--the enemy cannot\r\nbe aware of our movement[512].’ Graham was all across the Ebro by noon\r\non the 14th, Hill by the morning of the 16th. Wellington who had fixed\r\nhis head-quarters at the lost village of Masa in the hills, was able\r\nto declare with confidence that the whole army would be over the river\r\nby the night--‘and then the French must either fight, or retire out of\r\nSpain altogether.’\r\n\r\nThe Ebro country was a surprise to the British observers who had spent\r\nso many years in the uplands of Portugal or the rolling plains of the\r\nTierra de Campos. ‘Winding suddenly out of a narrow pass, we found\r\nourselves in the river valley, which extended some distance on our\r\nright. The beauty of the scenery was beyond description: the rocks\r\nrose perpendicularly on every side, without any visible opening to\r\nconvey an idea of an outlet. This enchanting valley is studded with\r\npicturesque hamlets and fruitful gardens producing every description of\r\nvegetation. At the Puente Arenas we met a number of sturdy women loaded\r\nwith fresh butter from the mountains of the Asturias. We had not tasted\r\nthat commodity for _two years_, therefore it will be unnecessary to\r\ndescribe how readily we made a purchase, nibbling by the way at such a\r\nluxury[513].’ Northern or Pyrenean Spain is a very different country\r\nfrom the dusty wind-swept central plateaux: above all the lack of\r\nwater, which is the curse of Castile, ceased at last to be the bane of\r\nmarching columns.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the Ebro on the 14th Graham’s column made another\r\nfour-league march on the 15th to the large town of Villarcayo, while\r\nthe Galicians got to Soncillo on the main road from Santander to\r\nBurgos; thus Wellington was certain of the new naval base to which\r\nhe had bid the Corunna transports sail only five days before. Hill’s\r\ntroops, who had a longer march during the last two days than the other\r\ncolumns, were not so far forward, but nearing the river had occupied\r\nthe heights on the southern side of the Puente de Arenas. The three\r\ncolumns forming the Anglo-Portuguese army were, as a glance at the map\r\nshows, in close touch with each other, and in a position where the\r\nwhole 80,000 men could be concentrated by a single march. Undoubtedly\r\nthe most surprising features of the advance is that Wellington’s\r\ncommissariat was able to feed such a mass of troops in such a limited\r\narea, after they had left the plains of Castile and plunged into the\r\nthinly inhabited mountains. The local supplies obtainable must have\r\nbeen very limited. Several diarists speak of biscuit being short[514],\r\nthough meat was not. But somehow or other the commissaries generally\r\ncontrived to find more or less food for the army--the well-organized\r\nmule trains were not far behind the infantry columns, and the long and\r\ndifficult movement was never checked--as earlier marches had been in\r\n1809 and 1811[515]--by the mere question of provisions, though many\r\nbrigades got but scanty meals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON ON THE EBRO. JUNE 15-20,1813\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter evacuating Burgos the French army had retired, at a rather\r\nleisurely rate, down the high road which leads by Briviesca and the\r\ndefile of Pancorbo to the valley of the Ebro. The rearguard, as we have\r\nseen, had left Burgos on the morning of the 13th, and halted for great\r\npart of the day at Gamonal, a few miles east of the city, on the spot\r\nwhere Napoleon had won his easy victory over the Conde de Belveder\r\non November 10, 1808. It was only followed by Spanish irregular\r\nhorse--some of Julian Sanchez’s ubiquitous lancers. Head-quarters that\r\nnight and the next (June 14) were at Briviesca, and remained there\r\nfor forty-eight hours: on the 15th they were moved on to Pancorbo, an\r\nadmirable position with a high-lying fort in the centre, while the\r\nroad is flanked for miles by steep slopes, on which an advantageous\r\nrearguard action might have been fought. But no pursuing enemy came in\r\nsight: this fact began to worry the French Head-quarters Staff. ‘What\r\ncould have become of Lord Wellington? The French Army, in full retreat,\r\nwas permitted to move leisurely along the great route, without being\r\nharassed or urged forward, not a carriage of any description being\r\nlost. It appeared inexplicable[516].’ The French retreat was leisurely\r\nfor two reasons--the first was that King Joseph wished to gain time\r\nfor the immense convoys lumbering in front of him to reach Miranda\r\nand Vittoria without being hustled. The second was that he thought\r\nthat every day gained gave more time for Clausel to come up: at the\r\nslow rate at which he was proceeding he might almost hope to find the\r\nmissing divisions of the Army of Portugal converging on Miranda, at\r\nthe moment when he should arrive there himself. The Council of War at\r\nBurgos had decided that Wellington must inevitably pursue by the great\r\n_chaussée_. The routes from the Burgos region to the upper Ebro had\r\nbeen reported both by French officers who claimed to know the country,\r\nand by local _Afrancesados_, as presenting insuperable difficulties to\r\na large army. There was, it is true, the high road Burgos-Santander\r\nby Santijanez, Pedrosa, and Reynosa--but this led north-west in an\r\neccentric direction, not towards Miranda or Vittoria. That the danger\r\nlay on the rough mountain ways a little farther east, which fall down\r\nto San Martin and Puente de Arenas, seems not to have been suspected.\r\nYet it was disquieting to find no pursuit in progress: could the Allied\r\nArmy possibly have been forced to halt at Burgos for want of supplies?\r\n\r\nOn the 16th the French army descended from the defile of Pancorbo\r\nto the Ebro, and proceeded to distribute itself in the region round\r\nMiranda, in cantonments which permitted of rapid concentration when it\r\nshould become necessary. Nothing was yet to be heard of Clausel--but on\r\nthe other hand Lamartinière’s division was again picked up--it handed\r\nover the duty of escorting the convoys toward Vittoria to Joseph’s\r\nSpanish contingent, the small division of Casapalacios. Sarrut’s\r\ndivision also came in from Biscay, and reported that it had been lately\r\nin touch with Foy, who was successfully hunting the local guerrilleros\r\nin the coast-land. But neither Foy himself, nor the troops of the\r\nArmy of the North which had been co-operating with him of late, were\r\nanywhere near. Strange as it may appear, that very capable officer had\r\nwholly failed to understand the general situation: though apprised ere\r\nnow of the evacuation of Madrid and Valladolid, he had nothing in his\r\nmind save his wholly secondary operations against the Biscay bands.\r\nHis dispatches of this period show him occupied entirely with the\r\nsafety of Bilbao, and the necessity for guarding the high road from\r\nBergara and Tolosa to France. There were 20,000 troops in Biscay, but\r\nthey were entirely dispersed on petty expeditions and convoy work. On\r\nJune 19, when he got from head-quarters the first dispatch that caused\r\nhim to think of concentrating and joining the main army, Foy had only\r\none battalion with him at the moment at Bergara. A column of 1,000\r\nmen was moving to reinforce the garrison of Bilbao, a brigade was at\r\nVillafranca escorting towards France the large body of prisoners whom\r\nhe had captured in his recent operations--another brigade was waiting\r\non the road between Vittoria and Mondragon, to pick up a large convoy\r\nwhich, as he had been warned, would be coming up the Royal Road and\r\nwould require to be protected as far as San Sebastian. He was making\r\nefforts to send provisions by sea to Bilbao and Castro-Urdiales--a task\r\nin which he was being worried by British cruisers off the coast--and\r\nwas preparing to go to Bilbao himself[517].\r\n\r\nNo doubt the main blame for this untimely dispersion of forces lay with\r\nGeneral Head-Quarters. Jourdan and Joseph ought to have sent orders\r\nto Foy, after the evacuation of Madrid, ordering him to cease all\r\nsecondary operations, to leave minimum garrisons at a few essential\r\npoints, abandon all the rest, and collect as strong a field-force as\r\npossible, with which to join the main army. But they had written to\r\nthe minister at Paris suggesting such moves, instead of dispatching\r\ndirect orders to that effect to the general himself. Foy had been sent\r\ninformation, not orders, and had failed to realize the full meaning\r\nof the information--absorbed as he was in his own particular Biscayan\r\nproblems. Events were marching very quickly: it was hard to realize\r\nthat Wellington, who had been on the Esla on May 31, would have been\r\nacross the upper Ebro with 70,000 men on June 15. It had taken little\r\nmore than a fortnight for him to overrun half of Northern Spain. The\r\nfact remained that of all the French troops operating in Biscay in\r\nJune, only Sarrut’s division, from Orduña, joined the King in time for\r\nthe battle of Vittoria. Yet Foy had under his orders not only his own\r\ndivision but the Italian brigade of St. Pol, and the mobile brigade\r\nof Berlier from the Army of the North, in addition to 10,000 men of\r\nthe garrisons of the various posts and fortresses of the North and the\r\nlittoral. And he had no enemy save the great partisan Longa in the\r\nwestern mountains, and the scattered remains of the local insurgents\r\nunder El Pastor and others, whom he had defeated in April and May, and\r\nwhom he was at present harrying from hill to coast and from coast to\r\nhill. We are once more forced to remember that the French armies in\r\nSpain were armies of occupation as well as armies of operation, and\r\nthat one of their functions was often fatal to the other.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the moment when the King’s army came back to the\r\nEbro. Head-quarters were, of course, established at Miranda, where the\r\nroyal Guard served as their escort. The Army of the South sent three\r\ndivisions across to the north bank of the river; they were cantoned\r\non the lower Zadorra about Arminion; but Gazan kept three brigades on\r\nthe south bank as a rearguard for the present, but (as the King hoped)\r\nto form a vanguard for a counter-advance, if only Clausel should come\r\nup soon, and an offensive campaign become possible. A small observing\r\nforce was left at Pancorbo, into whose castle a garrison was thrown.\r\nCavalry exploring parties, pushed out from this point, sought for\r\nWellington’s approaching columns as far as Poza de la Sal on the right,\r\nBriviesca on the high road, and Cerezo on the left; but to no effect.\r\nThey came in touch with nothing but detachments of Julian Sanchez’s\r\nLancers. D’Erlon, with the Army of the Centre, went ten miles down the\r\nEbro to Haro: he had now recovered his missing division, Darmagnac’s,\r\nwhich had been lent to Reille for the last two months. For the Army\r\nof Portugal having now three infantry divisions collected--Maucune’s,\r\nSarrut’s, and Lamartinière’s--was ordered to give back the borrowed\r\nunit to its proper commander. Reille took the right of the Ebro\r\nposition, having Maucune’s division at Frias, Sarrut’s at Espejo, and\r\nLamartinière’s at the Puente Lara. He was ordered to use his cavalry to\r\nsearch for signs of the enemy along the upper Ebro. The King had thus\r\nan army which, by the junction of Sarrut and Lamartinière, had risen\r\nto over 50,000 infantry and nearly 10,000 cavalry, concentrated on a\r\nshort front of 25 miles from Frias to Haro, covering the main road to\r\nFrance by Vittoria, and also the side roads to Orduña and Bilbao on\r\nthe one flank, and Logroño and Saragossa on the other. His retreat,\r\nthough dispiriting, had not yet been costly--it is doubtful whether\r\nhe had lost 1,000 casualties in the operations of the last six weeks.\r\nWith the exception of the combats at Salamanca on May 26 and Morales\r\non June 2, there had been no engagements of any importance. The army\r\nwas angry at the long-continued retreat; the officers were criticizing\r\nthe generalship of their commanders in the most outspoken fashion, but\r\nthere was no demoralization--the troops were clamouring for a general\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBut on June 17, when the French armies settled down into their new\r\nposition, with no detected enemy in their neighbourhood, their fate\r\nwas already determined--the Ebro line had been turned before it was\r\neven taken up. For on this same day Wellington had not only got his\r\nwhole army north of the Ebro, but was marching rapidly eastward, by\r\nthe mountain roads twenty miles north of the river, into the rear of\r\nReille’s cantonments. Of all his troops only Julian Sanchez and Carlos\r\nde España’s infantry division were left in Castile.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the Allied Army on the 15th-16th-17th June had been\r\ncarried out with surprising celerity. The Galician infantry, who had\r\ncrossed the river first, at Rocamonde, the bridge highest up on its\r\ncourse, on the 13th were hurrying northward, by cross roads not marked\r\non the map, and obviously impracticable for guns, to Soncillo (15th),\r\nQuintanilla de Pienza (16th), Villasana (17th), and Valmaseda in Biscay\r\n(18th). When they had reached the last-named town they were threatening\r\nBilbao, and almost at its gates. This was the great demonstration,\r\nintended to throw confusion among all the French detachments on the\r\nnorthern coast. Several of the stages exceeded thirty miles in the day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the three great columns of the Anglo-Portuguese army were\r\nexecuting a turning movement almost as wide as that of Giron’s\r\nGalicians. Converging from different bridges of the Ebro--Rocamonde\r\n(where some of Graham’s cavalry passed), San Martin de Lines (where\r\nthe bulk of Graham’s force debouched northward on the 14th), and\r\nPuente Arenas (used by the Head-quarters column on the 15th and by\r\nHill’s column on the 16th[518])--the whole army came in by successive\r\nmasses on to the two neighbouring towns of Villarcayo and Medina de\r\nPomar. At the latter place Longa turned up with his hard-marching\r\nCantabrian division, and joined the army. These considerable towns are\r\nthe road-centres of the whole rugged district between the Ebro and the\r\nCantabrian mountains. From them fork out the very few decent roads\r\nwhich exist in the land--those northward over the great sierras to\r\nSantander, Santoña, and Valmaseda-Bilbao: those eastward across their\r\nfoot-hills to Orduña-Vittoria and to Frias-Miranda. These five roads\r\nare the only ones practicable for artillery and transport: there are,\r\nhowever, minor tracks which can take infantry in good summer weather.\r\n\r\nFrom his head-quarters at Quintana, near the bridge of Puente Arenas,\r\nWellington dictated on the 15th the marching orders which governed\r\nthe next stage of the campaign. With the exception of the Galicians,\r\nalready starting on their circular sweep towards Bilbao, all his\r\ncolumns were directed to utilize the road parallel to the Ebro, but\r\ntwenty miles north of it, which runs from Medina de Pomar to Osma,\r\nOrduña, and Vittoria. He deliberately avoided employing the other high\r\nroad, which runs closer to the river from Medina de Pomar to Frias\r\nand Miranda, even for a side-column or a flying corps: only cavalry\r\nscouts were sent along it. The reason why the whole army was thrown\r\non to a single road--a thing generally to be avoided, especially when\r\ntime is precious--was partly that the appearance of British troops\r\nbefore Frias, where the enemy was known to have a detachment, would\r\ngive him early warning of the move. But the more important object was\r\nto strike at the French line of communication with Bayonne as far\r\nbehind the known position of King Joseph’s army as possible. If the\r\nline Frias-Miranda had been chosen, the enemy would have had many miles\r\nless to march, when once the alarm was given, if he wished to cover\r\nhis proper line of retreat. If a fight was coming, it had better be at\r\nor about Vittoria, rather than at or about Miranda. Moreover, the high\r\nroad, for a few miles east of Frias, passes to the south bank of the\r\nEbro, which it recrosses at the Puente Lara--there is only a bad track\r\nnorth of the river from Frias to that bridge. It would be absurd to\r\ndirect any part of the army to cross and recross the Ebro at passages\r\nwhich might be defended.\r\n\r\nSo the whole force was committed to the Medina-Osma road, except that\r\nthe infantry occasionally took cross-cuts by local tracks, in order\r\nto leave the all-important main line, as far as possible, to the\r\nguns and transport. The three corps in which the army had marched\r\nfrom the Pisuerga fell in behind each other, in the order in which\r\nthey had crossed the Ebro--Graham leading--the Head-Quarters column\r\nfollowing--Hill bringing up the rear. Longa’s Cantabrians went on\r\nas a sort of flying vanguard in front of Graham, not being burdened\r\nwith artillery[519]. The road was one which could only have been used\r\nfor such a large force in summer--it hugged the foot-hills of the\r\nCantabrian sierras, crossing successively the head-waters of several\r\nsmall rivers running south to the Ebro, each in its own valley. The\r\ncountry was thinly peopled and bare, so that little food could be\r\ngot to supplement the mule-borne rations. For this reason, as also\r\nwith the object of granting the French as little time as possible\r\nafter the first alarm should be given, the pace had to be forced.\r\nThe marches were long: on the 15th the head of Graham’s infantry was\r\nat Villarcayo: on the 16th at La Cerca (five miles beyond Medina de\r\nPomar): on the 17th at the mountain villages of San Martin de Loza and\r\nLastres de Teza: on the 18th it was due at Osma and at Berberena--a\r\nfew miles up the Osma-Orduña road. The Head-Quarters column having no\r\nexploration to do, since the way was reported clear in front, covered\r\nthe same distance in three marches instead of four, and was expected\r\nto reach the neighbourhood of Osma on the 18th. Hill’s column had also\r\nto hurry--its leading division was on that same day expected to be\r\nat Venta de Membligo, a posting station six miles short of Osma, so\r\nthat its head would be just behind the tail of the preceding corps.\r\nBut Hill’s rear would be strung out for many miles behind. However,\r\nall the fighting army was again in one mass--with a single exception.\r\nWellington had ordered the 6th division, commanded temporarily by his\r\nown brother-in-law Pakenham, to halt at Medina de Pomar. The reason\r\nwhich he gives in his dispatch[520] for depriving himself, now that the\r\nday of crisis was at hand, of a good division of 7,000 men, is that\r\nhe left it ‘to cover the march of our magazines and stores.’ This is\r\nalmost as puzzling a business as his leaving of Colville’s corps at Hal\r\non the day of the battle of Waterloo--the only similar incident in the\r\nlong record of his campaigns. If this was his sole reason, why should\r\nnot a smaller unit--Pack’s or Bradford’s independent brigade--or both\r\nof them--have been left behind? For that purpose such a force would\r\nhave sufficed. We are not informed that the 6th Division was more\r\nafflicted with sickness than any other, or that it was more way-worn.\r\nThe only supposition that suggests itself is that Wellington may have\r\nconsidered the possibility of Giron’s raid into Biscay failing, and\r\nbringing down on his rear some unsuspected mass of French troops from\r\nBilbao. If this idea entered his head, he may easily have thought it\r\nworth while to leave behind a solid reserve, on which Giron might fall\r\nback, and so to cover the rear of his main army while he was striking\r\nat the great road to France. But it must be confessed that this is\r\na mere hypothesis, and that the detachment of Pakenham’s division\r\nseems inexplicable from the information before us. It was ordered to\r\nfollow when the whole of the transport should be clear, if no further\r\ndevelopments had happened to complicate the situation. Carrying out\r\nthis direction literally, Pakenham waited three days at Medina de\r\nPomar, and so only got to the front twenty-four hours after the battle\r\nof Vittoria.[521]\r\n\r\nThe orders which Wellington issued upon the 17th[522] brought the head\r\nof his columns into touch with the enemy. They directed that Graham,\r\nwith the 1st and 5th Division, Pack and Bradford, should move past\r\nOsma on to Orduña, by the two alternative routes available between\r\nthose places, while the Head-Quarters column should not turn north\r\ntoward Orduña on reaching Osma, but pursue the roads south-eastward\r\nby Espejo and Carcamo, which lead to Vittoria by a more southerly\r\nline. The result contemplated was very much that which was worked out\r\nin the battle of the 21st--a frontal attack by the main body, with\r\nan outflanking move by Graham’s corps, which would bring it into the\r\nrear of the enemy. But the route via Orduña was not the one which\r\nthe northern column was actually destined to take, as the events of\r\nthe 18th distracted it into a shorter but rougher road to the same\r\ndestination (Murguia), which it would have reached by a much longer\r\nturn on the high road via Orduña.\r\n\r\nBut all the columns were not moving on the main track from Medina de\r\nPomar to Osma this day, for Wellington had directed the Light Division\r\nto drop its artillery to the care of the 4th Division, and cut across\r\nthe hills south of the high road, by a country path which goes by La\r\nBoveda, San Millan, and Villanan to a point, a few miles south of Osma,\r\nin the same valley of the Omecillo in which that town lies. And Hill,\r\nstill far to the rear, was told to detach two brigades of the 2nd\r\nDivision, and send them to follow the Light Division along the same\r\nline: if Alten should send back word that the route was practicable\r\nfor guns, Hill was to attach his Portuguese field battery to this\r\nadvance-column.\r\n\r\nIt was, apparently, on the morning of the 17th June only that the\r\nFrench got definite indications of the direction in which the British\r\narmy might be looked for. Maucune reported from Frias, not long after\r\nhis arrival there, that hostile cavalry were across the Ebro in the\r\ndirection of Puente Arenas, and that other troops in uncertain strength\r\nwere behind them. It was clearly necessary to take new measures,\r\nin view of the fact that the enemy was beyond the Ebro, in a place\r\nwhere he had not been expected. How much did the move imply? After\r\nconsideration Joseph and Jourdan concluded, quite correctly, that\r\nsince the main body of Wellington’s army had been invisible for so\r\nmany days--it had last been seen on the Hormaza on June 12th--it was\r\nprobably continuing its old policy of circular marches to turn the\r\nFrench right. This was correct, but they credited Wellington with\r\nintending to get round them not by the shorter routes Osma-Vittoria,\r\nbut by the much longer route by Valmaseda and Bilbao, which would cut\r\ninto the high road to France at Bergara, far behind Vittoria.\r\n\r\nWith this idea in their heads the King and the Marshal issued orders\r\nof a lamentably unpractical scope, considering the position occupied\r\nby Wellington’s leading divisions on June 17th. Reille was ordered to\r\ncollect his three infantry divisions at Osma, and to hurry across the\r\nmountains by Valmaseda, to cover Bilbao from the west, by taking up a\r\nposition somewhere about Miravalles. He would find the Biscayan capital\r\nalready held by St. Pol’s Italians, and Rouget’s brigade of the Army\r\nof the North. Foy, who was believed to be at Tolosa, was instructed to\r\nbring up his division to the same point. Thus a force of some 25,000\r\nmen would be collected at Bilbao. Meanwhile Reille’s original positions\r\nat Frias and the Puente Lara would be taken over by Gazan, who would\r\nmarch up the Ebro from Arminion with two divisions of infantry and one\r\nof cavalry, to watch the north bank of the Ebro. ‘These dispositions,’\r\nremarks Jourdan, ‘were intended to retard the advance of the enemy\r\nin this mountainous region, and so to gain time for the arrival of\r\nthe reinforcements we were expecting [i.e. Clausel]. But it was too\r\nlate![523]’\r\n\r\nNo worse orders could have been given. If Wellington had struck\r\ntwenty-four hours later than he did, and Reille had been able to carry\r\nout his first day’s appointed move, and to get forward towards Bilbao,\r\nthe result would have been to split the French army in two, with the\r\nmain range of the Cantabrian sierras between them: since Reille and Foy\r\nwould have joined at Bilbao--three days’ forced marches away from the\r\nKing. Meanwhile Joseph, deprived of the whole Army of Portugal, would\r\nhave had Wellington striking in on his flank by Osma, and would have\r\nbeen forced to fight something resembling the battle of Vittoria with\r\n10,000 men less in hand than he actually owned on June 21. Either he\r\nwould have suffered an even worse defeat than was his lot at Vittoria,\r\nor he would have been compelled to retreat without fighting, down the\r\nEbro, or towards Pampeluna. In either case he would have lost the line\r\nof communication with France; and while he was driven far east, Foy and\r\nReille would have had to hurry back on Bayonne, with some risk of being\r\nintercepted and cut off on the way.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Reille was checked and turned back upon the first\r\nday of his northward march. He had sent orders to Maucune to join him\r\nfrom Frias, either by the road along the Ebro by Puente Lara, or by the\r\nmountain track which goes directly from Frias to Espejo. Then, without\r\nwaiting for Maucune, he started from Espejo to march on Osma. He had\r\ngone only a few miles when he discovered a British column debouching on\r\nOsma, by the road from Berberena[524] and the north-west, which he had\r\nbeen intending to take himself. Seeing his path blocked, but being loth\r\nto give way before what might be no more than a detachment, he drew up\r\nhis two divisions on the hillside a mile south of Osma and appeared\r\nready to offer battle. Moreover, he was expecting the arrival of\r\nMaucune, and judged that if he made off without delaying the enemy in\r\nfront of him, the column from Frias might be intercepted and encircled.\r\n\r\nThe troops which Reille had met were Graham’s main column--the 1st and\r\n5th divisions with Bradford’s Portuguese and Anson’s Light Dragoons,\r\non their march towards Orduña. Graham prepared to attack, sent forward\r\nthe German Legion light battalions of the 1st Division, and pushed out\r\nNorman Ramsay’s horse artillery, with a cavalry escort, to the right\r\nof Osma, forming the rest of his force for a general advance across\r\nthe Bilbao road. After estimating the strength of the British, Reille\r\nappeared at first inclined to fight, or at least to show an intention\r\nof fighting. But a new enemy suddenly came up--the 4th Division\r\nappeared on a side road, descending from the hills on the right of\r\nGraham’s line. It had just time to throw out its light companies to\r\nskirmish[525] when Reille, seeing himself obviously outnumbered and\r\noutflanked, retreated hastily on Espejo; the 5th Division followed him\r\non the left, with some tiraillade, the 4th Division on the right, but\r\nhe was not caught. ‘Considerable fire on both sides but little done,’\r\nremarked an observer on the hillside[526]. Reille’s loss was probably\r\nabout 120 men, nearly all in Sarrut’s division[527]: that of the\r\nBritish some 50 or 60.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there had been a much more lively fight, with heavier\r\ncasualties, a few miles farther south among the mountains nearer the\r\nEbro. Maucune had started before dawn from Frias, intending to join\r\nReille by a short cut through the hills, instead of sticking to the\r\nbetter road along the river-bank by the Puente Lara. He only sent his\r\nguns with a cavalry escort by that route. He was marching with his two\r\nbrigades at a considerable distance from each other, the rear one being\r\nhampered by the charge of the divisional transport and baggage.\r\n\r\nThe leading brigade had reached the hamlet of San Millan and was\r\nresting there by a brook, when British cavalry scouts came in upon\r\nthem--these were German Legion Hussars, at the head of the Light\r\nDivision, which Wellington had sent by the cross-path over the hills\r\nby La Boveda. The approaching column had been marching along a narrow\r\nroad, shrouded by overhanging rocks and high banks, in which it\r\ncould neither see nor be seen. On getting the alarm the four French\r\nbattalions formed up to fight, in the small open space about the\r\nvillage, while the head of the British column, Vandeleur’s brigade,\r\ndeployed as fast as it could opposite them, and attacked; the 2/95th\r\nand 3rd Caçadores in front line, the 52nd in support. Maucune was\r\nforced to make a stand, because his rear brigade was coming up,\r\nunseen by his enemies, and would have been cut off from him if he had\r\nretreated at once. But when the head of Kempt’s brigade of the Light\r\nDivision appeared, and began to deploy to the left of Vandeleur’s, he\r\nsaw that he was outnumbered, and gave ground perforce. He had been\r\ndriven through the village, and was making off along the road, with\r\nthe Rifle battalions in hot pursuit, when his second brigade, with\r\nthe baggage in its rear, came on the scene--most unexpected by the\r\nBritish, for the track by which it emerged issued out between two\r\nperpendicular rocks and had not been noticed. Perceiving the trap into\r\nwhich they had fallen, the belated French turned off the road, and\r\nmade for the hillside to their right, while Kempt’s brigade started\r\nin pursuit, scrambling over the rocky slopes to catch them up. The\r\nline of flight of the French took them past the ground over which\r\nVandeleur’s men were chasing their comrades of the leading brigade,\r\nand the odd result followed that they came in upon the rear of the\r\n52nd, and, though pursued, seemed to be themselves pursuing. The\r\nOxfordshire battalion thereupon performed the extraordinary feat of\r\nbringing up its left shoulder, forming line facing to the rear at a\r\nrun, and charging backward. They encountered the enemy at the top of\r\na slope, but the French, seeing themselves between two fires, for\r\nKempt’s men were following hotly behind them, avoided the collision,\r\nstruck off diagonally, and scattering and throwing away their packs\r\nwent off in disorder eastward, still keeping up a running fight. The\r\nlarge majority escaped, and joined Gazan’s troops at Miranda. Meanwhile\r\nthe first brigade, pursued by the Rifles and Caçadores, got away in\r\nmuch better order, and reached Reille’s main body at Espejo. The\r\ntransport which had come out of the narrow road too late to follow the\r\nregiments, was captured whole, after a desperate resistance by the\r\nbaggage-guard. Maucune got off easily, all things considered, with\r\nthe loss of three hundred prisoners, many of them wounded, and all\r\nhis impedimenta[528]. The fight was no discredit to the general or\r\nto his men, who saved themselves by presence of mind, when caught at\r\nevery disadvantage--inferior troops would have laid down their arms\r\n_en masse_ when they found themselves between two fires in rough and\r\nunknown ground[529]. The total British loss in the two simultaneous\r\ncombats of Osma and San Millan was 27 killed and 153 wounded.\r\n\r\nReille, having picked up Maucune’s first brigade at Espejo, continued\r\nhis retreat, and got behind the Bayas river at Subijana that night.\r\nThe report which he had to send to head-quarters upset all the plans\r\nof Jourdan and the King, and forced them to reconsider their position,\r\nwhich was obviously most uncomfortable, as their line of defence\r\nalong the Ebro was taken in flank, and the proposed succour to Bilbao\r\nmade impossible. At least four British divisions had been detected by\r\nReille, but where were the rest, and where were the Spaniards, who\r\nwere known to be in some strength with Wellington? Was the whole Allied\r\nhost behind the force which had driven in the Army of Portugal, or\r\nwas there some great unseen column executing some further inscrutable\r\nmovement?\r\n\r\nThere was hot discussion at Miranda that night. Reille repeated the\r\nproposition which had already been made at Burgos six days back, that\r\nin consideration of the fact that the army was hopelessly outflanked,\r\nand that its retreat by the high road to Vittoria and Bayonne was\r\nthreatened by the presence of Wellington on the Bayas, it should\r\nabandon that line of communication altogether, march down the Ebro,\r\nand take up the line of Pampeluna and Saragossa, rallying Clausel and,\r\nif possible, Suchet, for a general concentration, by which the British\r\narmy could be driven back as it had been from Burgos in 1812. Foy and\r\nthe Biscay garrisons would have to take care of themselves--it was\r\nunlikely that Wellington would be able to fall upon them, when the\r\nwhole of the rest of the French armies of Spain were on his flank, and\r\ntaking the offensive against him.\r\n\r\nJoseph, for the third time, refused to consider this scheme, alleging,\r\nas before, the Emperor’s strict orders to keep to the Bayonne base, and\r\nto hold on to the great royal _chaussée_. But, as is clear, his refusal\r\nwas affected by another consideration which in his eyes had almost\r\nequally decisive weight. Vittoria was crammed with the great convoys\r\nof French and Spanish refugees which had accumulated there, along with\r\nall the plunder of Madrid, and the military material representing\r\nthe ‘grand train’ of the whole army of Spain--not to speak of his\r\nown immense private baggage. There had also arrived, within the last\r\nfew days, a large consignment of hard cash--the belated arrears of\r\nthe allowance which the Emperor had consented to give to the Army of\r\nSpain. One of Foy’s brigades had escorted these fourgons of treasure to\r\nVittoria, and dropped them there, returning to Bergara with a section\r\nof the refugees in charge, to be passed on to Bayonne.[530] The amount\r\ndelivered was not less than five million francs--bitterly needed by the\r\ntroops, who were in long arrears. All this accumulation at Vittoria\r\nwas in large measure due to the King’s reluctance during the retreat\r\nto order a general shift of all his officials and impedimenta over the\r\nborder into France. As long as his ministers, and all the plant of\r\nroyalty, remained on the south side of the Pyrenees, he still seemed\r\na king. And he had hoped to maintain himself first on the Douro, then\r\nabout Burgos, then on the Ebro. It was only when this last line was\r\nforced that he made up his mind to surrender his theoretical status,\r\nand think of military considerations alone. The lateness of his\r\ndecision was to prove most fatal to his adherents.\r\n\r\nHaving resolved to order a general retreat on Vittoria, Joseph and\r\nJourdan took such precautions as seemed possible. Reiterated orders\r\nfor haste were sent to Foy and Clausel: the latter was told to\r\nmarch on Vittoria not on Miranda. Unfortunately he had received the\r\ndispatch sent from Burgos on June 15th, which gave him Miranda as\r\nthe concentration-point, and had already gathered his divisions at\r\nPampeluna on June 18, and started to march by Estella and Logroño\r\nand along the north bank of the Ebro. This gave him two sides\r\nof a triangle to cover, while if he had been assigned the route\r\nPampeluna-Salvatierra-Vittoria, he would have been saved eighty miles\r\nof road. But on June 9th, when the original orders were issued, no\r\none could have foreseen, save Wellington, that the critical day of\r\nthe campaign would have found the French army far north of the Ebro.\r\nAnd the new dispatch, sent off on the night of the 18th-19th, started\r\nfar too late to reach Pampeluna in time to stop Clausel’s departure\r\nsouthward. Indeed, it did not catch him up till the battle of Vittoria\r\nhad been fought, and the King was a fugitive on the way to France. Foy\r\nreceived orders a little earlier, though not apparently those sent\r\ndirectly by the King, but a copy of a dispatch to Thouvenot, governor\r\nof Vittoria, in which the latter was instructed ‘that if General Foy\r\nand his division are in your neighbourhood, you are to bid him give up\r\nhis march on Bilbao, and draw in towards Vittoria, unless his presence\r\nis absolutely necessary at the point where he may be at present[531].’\r\nThis unhappy piece of wording gave Foy a choice, which he interpreted\r\nas authorizing him to remain at Bergara, so as to cover the high road\r\nto France, a task which he held to be ‘absolutely necessary.’\r\n\r\nAs to the troops already on the spot, Reille was ordered to defend\r\nthe line of the Bayas river, until the armies of the South and Centre\r\nshould have had time to get past his rear and reach Vittoria. Gazan\r\nwas ordered to collect the whole of the Army of the South at Arminion,\r\nbehind Miranda, drawing in at once the considerable detachment which he\r\nhad left beyond the Ebro. In this position he was to wait till D’Erlon,\r\nwith the Army of the Centre, who had to move up from Haro, ten miles to\r\nthe south, should have arrived and have got on to the great _chaussée_.\r\nHe was then to follow him, acting as rearguard of the whole force.\r\nBetween Arminion and Vittoria the road passes for two miles through the\r\nvery narrow defile of Puebla, the bottle-neck through which the Zadorra\r\nriver cuts its way from the upland plain of Vittoria to the lower level\r\nof the Ebro valley.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon, starting at dawn from Haro, reached Arminion at 10 o’clock\r\nin the morning of the 19th, and pushed up the defile: the head of his\r\ncolumn was just emerging from its northern end when a heavy cannonade\r\nbegan to be heard in the west. It continued all the time that the\r\nArmy of the South was pressing up the defile, and grew nearer. This,\r\nof course, marked the approach of Wellington, driving the covering\r\nforce under Reille before him toward the Zadorra. The British\r\ncommander-in-chief had slept the night at Berberena near Osma, and had\r\nthere drafted a set of orders which considerably modified his original\r\nscheme: probably the change was due to topographical information, newly\r\ngarnered up from the countryside. Instead of sending Graham’s column\r\nvia Orduña, to cut in on the flank of the _chaussée_ behind Vittoria,\r\nhe had resolved to send it by a shorter route, a mere country road\r\nwhich goes by Luna, Santa Eulalia, and Jocano to Murguia--the village\r\nwhich it had been ordered on the previous day to reach via Orduña\r\nand the high road. Presumably it had been discovered that this would\r\nsave time,--the advantage of using a first-rate track being more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the fact that the Orduña road was not only ten miles\r\nlonger but crossed and recrossed by steep slopes the main sierra,\r\nwhich forms the watershed between Biscay and Alava. Or possibly it\r\nwas only the discovery that the Luna-Jocano route could be taken by\r\nartillery that settled the matter: if it had been reported useless\r\nfor wheeled traffic the old orders might have stood. At any rate, the\r\nturning movement, which was to take Graham into the rear of Vittoria,\r\nwas made south of the main mountain chain, and not north of it[532].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though Graham diverged north-eastward, the rest of the\r\nArmy moved straight forward from the valley of the Omecillo to that\r\nof the Bayas in four columns, all parallel to each other, and all\r\nmoving by country roads. The 3rd Division was ordered from Berberena to\r\nCarcamo--the 7th followed behind it. The 4th Division with D’Urban’s\r\ncavalry in front, and the Light Division with V. Alten’s hussars in\r\nfront, were directed on Subijana and Pobes, keeping in close and\r\nconstant communication with each other. Behind them came the cavalry\r\nreserve--R. Hill’s, Grant’s, and Ponsonby’s brigades--also the heavy\r\nartillery. Hill’s column, which had now come up into touch with the\r\nleading divisions, kept to the high road from Osma and Espejo towards\r\nthe Puente Lara and the Ebro. But only cavalry reconnaissances went as\r\nfar as the river--the mass of the corps turned off eastward when it\r\nhad passed Espejo, and moved by Salinas de Añana, so as to come out\r\ninto the valley of the Bayas south of the route of the Light Division.\r\nIt thus became the right wing of the army which was deploying for the\r\nfrontal attack.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned above that a local Spanish force from the\r\nCantabrian mountains had joined Wellington at Medina de Pomar; this was\r\nthe so-called ‘division’, some 3,500 bayonets, of the great guerrillero\r\nof the coast-land, Longa, now no more an irregular but a titular\r\ncolonel, while his _partida_ had been reorganized as four battalions\r\nof light infantry. Longa was a tough and persistent fighter--a\r\ncase of the ‘survival of the fittest’ among many insurgent chiefs\r\nwho had perished. His men were veteran mountaineers, indefatigable\r\nmarchers, and skilled skirmishers, if rudimentary in their drill and\r\nequipment. Wellington during the ensuing campaign gave more work to\r\nthem than to any other Spanish troops that were at his disposal--save\r\nthe Estremaduran division of Morillo, old comrades of Hill’s corps,\r\nto which they had always been attached since 1811. The use which\r\nWellington now made of Longa’s men was to employ them as a light\r\ncovering shield for Graham’s turning force. They had been sent across\r\nthe hills from Quincoces[533] on the 17th to occupy Orduña--from thence\r\nthey descended on the 19th on to Murguia, thus placing themselves at\r\nthe head of the turning column. The object of the arrangement was that,\r\nif the enemy should detect the column, he would imagine it to be a\r\nSpanish demonstration, and not suspect that a heavy British force lay\r\nhid behind the familiar guerrilleros. While Longa was thus brought in\r\nsideways, to form the head of Graham’s column, the other Spanish force\r\nwhich Wellington was employing was also deflected to join the main\r\narmy. Giron’s Galicians, as has been mentioned above, had been sent\r\nby a long sweep through the sierras to demonstrate against Bilbao.\r\nThey had reached Valmaseda on the 18th, and their approach had alarmed\r\nall the French garrisons of Biscay. Now, having put themselves in\r\nevidence in the north, they were suddenly recalled, ordered to march by\r\nAmurrio on Orduña and Murguia, and so to fall into the rear of Graham’s\r\ncolumn. The distances were considerable, the roads steep, and Giron\r\nonly came up with the Anglo-Portuguese army on the afternoon of the\r\nbattle of Vittoria, in which (unlike Longa) he was too late to take\r\nany part. Somewhere on his march from Aguilar to Valmaseda he picked\r\nup a reinforcement, the very small Asturian division of Porlier--three\r\nbattalions or 2,400 men--which Mendizabal had sent to join him from the\r\nblockade of Santoña. This raised the Galician Army to a total of some\r\n14,000 bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe 19th June was a very critical day, as no one knew better than\r\nWellington. The problem was whether, starting with the heads of\r\nhis column facing the line of the Bayas, where Reille had rallied\r\nhis three divisions and was standing at bay, he could drive in the\r\ndetaining force, and cross the Zadorra in pursuit of it, fast enough to\r\nsurprise some part of the French army still in its march up from the\r\nsouth. And, as an equally important problem, there was the question\r\nwhether Graham, marching on Murguia, could reach the upper Zadorra\r\nand cut the great road north of Vittoria, before the French were in\r\nposition to cover it. If these operations could be carried out, there\r\nwould be a scrambling fight scattered over much ground, rather than\r\na regular pitched battle. If they could not, there would be a formal\r\ngeneral action on the 20th or 21st against an enemy established in\r\nposition--unless indeed King Joseph should choose to continue his\r\nretreat without fighting, which Wellington thought quite possible[534].\r\n\r\nWellington is censured by some critics, including Napier[535], for not\r\nmaking a swifter advance on the 19th. It is said that a little more\r\nhaste would have enabled him to get to Vittoria as soon as the enemy,\r\nand to force him to fight in dislocated disorder on ground which he had\r\nnot chosen. This seems unjustifiable. The distance between the camps\r\nof the Allied Army, in front of Osma and Espejo, and Vittoria is some\r\ntwenty miles--difficult ground, with the Bayas river flowing through\r\nthe midst of it and a formidable position held by 15,000 French behind\r\nthat stream. As Reille, conscious how much depended on his gaining\r\ntime for the King to retreat from Miranda, was determined to detain\r\nthe Allied Army as long as he could, it would have been useless to try\r\nto drive him away by a light attack. The rear of each of Wellington’s\r\ncolumns was trailing many miles behind the leading brigade. It was\r\nnecessary to bring up against Reille a force sufficient to make serious\r\nresistance impossible, and this Wellington did, pushing forward not\r\nonly the 4th and Light Divisions, but Hill’s column in support, on the\r\nsouthern flank. It took time to get them deployed, and the attack was\r\nopened by a cannonade. By the time that a general advance was ordered\r\nReille had begun to retire--he did so very neatly, and crossed the\r\nZadorra by the four nearest bridges without any appreciable loss. By\r\nthis time the afternoon had arrived, the rest of the French army had\r\npassed the defile of Puebla, and Wellington judged the hour too late\r\nfor the commencement of a pitched battle[536]. Moreover, he did not\r\nintend to fight without the co-operation of Graham’s column, and the\r\nlatter was not where he would have wished it to be. The day had been\r\nvery rainy, the cross roads were bad, and by some error of staff-work\r\nthe head of the column had not received the countermarching orders\r\ndirecting it to march direct on Murguia, but had started in accordance\r\nwith the earlier plan on to the Orduña road; the 1st and 5th Divisions\r\nhad gone some way upon it before they were recalled and counter-marched\r\ninto the right path[537]. Owing to blocks and bad weather they only\r\nreached Jocano, some six or eight miles east of Osma, by six in the\r\nevening. Murguia was still nine miles ahead, the rain was still falling\r\nin torrents, and Graham ordered the divisions to halt and encamp for\r\nthe night. The fate of the campaign was not to be fought out that day,\r\nnor on the next, but on the third morning--that of June 21st, 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF VITTORIA. JUNE 21, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) THE FIRST STAGE\r\n\r\nThe plain of Vittoria, into which the French army debouched on the\r\nafternoon of June 19th, is a plain only by comparison with the high\r\nhills which surround it on all sides, being an oval expanse of rolling\r\nground drained by the swift and narrow Zadorra river, which runs\r\non its north-eastern side. Only in its northern section, near the\r\ncity, does it show really flat ground. It is about twelve miles long\r\nfrom north-east to south-west, and varies from six to eight miles in\r\nbreadth. The Zadorra is one of those mountain streams which twist in\r\nnumberless loops and bends of alternate shallows and deep pools, in\r\norder to get round rocks or spurs which stand in the way of their\r\ndirect course[538]. At one point seven miles down-stream from Vittoria\r\nit indulges in a complete ‘hairpin-bend’ in which are the bridges of\r\nTres Puentes and Villodas, as it circles round a precipitous knoll. At\r\nseveral other spots it executes minor loops in its tortuous course.\r\nThe little city of Vittoria stands on an isolated rising ground at its\r\nnorthern end, very visible from all directions, and dominating the\r\nwhole upland with two prominent church spires at its highest point.\r\nThe great road from France enters the plain of Vittoria and the valley\r\nof the Zadorra three miles north-east of the city, descending from the\r\ndefile of Salinas, a long and difficult pass in which Mina and other\r\nguerrilleros had executed some of their most daring raids on French\r\nconvoys. After passing Vittoria the road keeps to the middle of the\r\nupland in a westerly direction, and issues from it by the defile of La\r\nPuebla, where the Zadorra cuts its way through the Sierra de Andia in\r\norder to join the Ebro. There is not much more than room for road and\r\nriver in the gorge, which is dominated by the heights of La Puebla,\r\na spur of the Andia, on the east, and by a corresponding but lower\r\nrange, the end of the heights of Morillas on the west.\r\n\r\nBut the Bayonne _chaussée_ is by no means the only road in the Vittoria\r\nupland. The city is the meeting point of a number of second-class and\r\nthird-class routes, debouching from various subsidiary valleys of the\r\nPyrenees and leading to various towns in Navarre or Biscay. Of these\r\nthe chief were (1) the Salvatierra-Pampeluna road, running due east,\r\nand then crossing from the valley of the Zadorra to the upper waters\r\nof the Araquil, by which it descends into Navarre. This was a route\r\npracticable for artillery or transport, but narrow, ill repaired, and\r\nsteep--eminently not a line to be taken by a large force in a hurry;\r\n(2) the main road to Bilbao by Villareal and Durango, a coach road, but\r\nvery tortuous, and ascending high mountains by long curves and twists;\r\n(3) the alternative coach route to Bilbao by Murguia and Orduña, easier\r\nthan the Villareal road in its first section, but forced to cross the\r\nmain chain of the Pyrenees by difficult gradients before descending\r\ninto Biscay; (4) a bad side road to the central Ebro, going due south\r\nby Trevino and La Guardia to Logroño; (5) a similar route, running due\r\neast from Subijana on the Bayas to the bridges of Nanclares three miles\r\nup-stream from the defile of Puebla. At the opening of the battle of\r\nVittoria Graham’s column was already across the Murguia-Bilbao road,\r\nand in its earliest advance blocked the Durango-Bilbao road also. Thus\r\nthe only route beside the great _chaussée_ available for the French was\r\nthat to Salvatierra and Pampeluna. The road to Trevino and Logroño was\r\nuseless, as leading in an undesired direction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these five coach roads there were several country tracks\r\nrunning from various points on the Bayas river to minor bridges on the\r\nZadorra, across the lofty Monte Arrato, the watershed between the two\r\nstreams. It was these fifth-rate tracks which Wellington used on the\r\nbattle-day for the advance of some of his central columns, while Hill\r\non the right was forcing the defile of La Puebla, and Graham on the\r\nleft was descending from Murguia on to the bridges of the upper Zadorra\r\nnorth-east of Vittoria.\r\n\r\nHaving their troops safely concentrated east of the Zadorra on the\r\nevening of June 19, Joseph and Jourdan made up their minds to stand\r\non the position behind that river, even though Clausel had not yet\r\ncome up, nor sent any intelligence as to the route by which he was\r\narriving. Aides-de-camp were searching for him in all directions--but\r\nnothing had yet been ascertained, beyond the fact that he had started\r\nfrom Pampeluna on June 15th, marching on Logroño[539]. There was a\r\nhigh chance that some one of many missives would reach him, and turn\r\nhim on to Vittoria. But the idea that Clausel must now be very near at\r\nhand was less operative in compelling Joseph to fight than the idea\r\nthat he must at all cost save the vast convoys accumulated around him,\r\nhis treasure, his military train, his ministers, and his refugees. He\r\nwas getting them off northward by the high road as fast as he could:\r\none convoy marched on the 20th, under the charge of the troops of the\r\nArmy of the North who had formed the garrison of Vittoria, another\r\nand a larger at dawn on the 21st, escorted by the whole of Maucune’s\r\ndivision. It had with it many of the Old Masters stolen from the royal\r\npalace at Madrid--the pictures of Titian, Rafael, and Velasquez, which\r\nhad been the pride of the old dynasty--with the pick of the royal\r\narmoury and cabinet of Natural History[540]. It is almost as difficult\r\nto make out how Joseph, already unequal in numbers to his enemy, dared\r\nto deprive himself of Maucune’s division of the Army of Portugal, as\r\nto discover why Wellington left the 6th Division at Medina de Pomar.\r\nIt does not seem that the morale of the unit had been shaken by its\r\nrude experience at San Millan on the 18th, for it fought excellently in\r\nsubsequent operations: nor had it suffered any disabling losses in that\r\nfight. A more obvious escort might have been found in Casapalacios’\r\nSpanish auxiliaries, who had already been utilized for similar purposes\r\nbetween Madrid and Vittoria, or in the scraps of the Army of the North\r\nwhich had lately joined the retreating host. But they remained for the\r\nbattle, while Maucune marched north, with the cannon sounding behind\r\nhim all day.\r\n\r\nWhen Jourdan and Joseph first arrayed their host for the expected\r\nbattle, it would seem, from the line which they took up, that they\r\nimagined that Wellington would attack them only from the direction\r\nof the Bayas, and paid no attention to Graham’s flanking movement,\r\nthough afterwards they wrote dispatches to prove that they had not\r\nignored it. For they drew up the Army of the South on a short front,\r\nfrom the exit of the defile of Puebla on the south to the bridge of\r\nVillodas on the north, a front of three miles, with D’Erlon’s two\r\ndivisions in second line on each side of the village of Gomecha, two\r\nmiles farther back, and the Army of Portugal and the King’s Guards as\r\na third line in reserve about Zuazo, not far in front of Vittoria,\r\nalong with the bulk of the cavalry. This order of battle, as a glance\r\nat the map shows, presupposed a frontal attack from the line of the\r\nBayas, where Wellington was known to be. It was ill-suited to face an\r\nattack from the north-west on the line of the Zadorra above Villodas,\r\nand still more so an attack from the due north by the roads from Orduña\r\nand Murguia. On the morning of the 20th cavalry reconnaissances went\r\nout to look for the Allied Army--they reported that the camps along\r\nthe Bayas above Subijana Morillos did not seem very large, and that\r\non the Murguia road they had fallen in with and pushed back Longa’s\r\nirregulars, obviously a Spanish demonstration[541]. ‘No indication\r\nbeing available of the details of a projected attack, and further\r\ninformation being unprocurable, only conjectures could be made[542].’\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know from the narrative of Jourdan himself what\r\nthese conjectures were. ‘Wellington,’ he writes, ‘had shown himself\r\nsince the start of the campaign more disposed to manœuvre his opponents\r\nout of their positions, by constantly turning their right wing, than to\r\nattack them frontally and force on a battle. It was thought probable\r\nthat, pursuing this system, he would march on Bilbao by Orduña, and\r\nfrom thence on Durango, so as to force them to fall back promptly on\r\nMondragon[543], in order to retain their communications with France. He\r\nmight even hope to force them to evacuate Spain by this move, because\r\nit would be impossible to feed a great army on that section of the\r\nPyrenees. The King, knowing that Clausel was on the move, had little\r\nfear of the results of a march on Bilbao, for on receiving Clausel’s\r\ncorps he would be strong enough to take the offensive himself, and\r\nwould strike at Wellington’s communications. It did not escape him\r\nthat if the enemy, instead of wasting more time on flank movements,\r\nshould attack him before the arrival of Clausel, he was in a perilous\r\nposition. For there was little chance of getting the better of an\r\nadversary who had about double numbers, and a lost battle would cut\r\noff the army from the road to France, and force it to retire on\r\nPampeluna by a road difficult, if not impracticable, for the train\r\nand artillery of a great host. To avoid the risk of an instant attack\r\nfrom Wellington, ought we to fall back and take up the position above\r\nthe pass of Salinas?[544] But to do this was to sacrifice the junction\r\nwith Clausel, who was expected on the 21st at latest. And how could\r\nthe army have been fed in the passes? The greater part of the cavalry\r\nand the artillery horses would have had to be sent back to France at\r\nonce--famine would have forced the infantry to follow. Then the King\r\nwould have been accused of cowardice, for evacuating Spain without\r\ntrying the fortune of battle. To justify such a retreat we should have\r\nhad to be _certain_ that we were to be attacked before the 22nd, and\r\nwe considered that, if Wellington did decide to fight, it would be\r\nunlikely that he could do so before the 22nd, because of the difficulty\r\nof the roads which he had taken. After mature consideration of the\r\ncircumstance the King resolved to stand fast at Vittoria.’\r\n\r\nPutting aside the gross over-estimate of Wellington’s strength--he\r\nfought with a superiority of 75,000[545] to 57,000, not with two to\r\none--the main point to note in this curious and interesting argument\r\nis its defective psychology. Because Wellington had hitherto avoided\r\nfrontal attacks, when flank movements suited him better, was it safe\r\nto conclude that he would do so _ad infinitum_? That he was capable of\r\na sudden onslaught was obvious to every one who remembered the battle\r\nof Salamanca. Why, if he were about to repeat his previous encircling\r\npolicy, should he go by Orduña, Bilbao, and Durango, rather than by\r\nthe shorter turn Osma-Murguia-Vittoria? Apparently the French staff\r\nunderrated the possibilities of that road, and took the presence of\r\nLonga upon it as a sign that it was only to be used for a Spanish\r\ndemonstration[546]. Should not the speed with which Wellington had\r\ntraversed the detestable country paths between the Arlanzon and the\r\nEbro have served as a warning that, if he chose to push hard, he could\r\ncover at a very rapid rate the rather less formidable tracks north\r\nof the Zadorra? In short, the old marshal committed the not uncommon\r\nfault of making false deductions from an imperfect set of premises. It\r\nis much more difficult to say what should have been his actual course\r\nunder the existing circumstances of June 20. Napier holds that he might\r\nstill have adopted Reille’s old plan of June 12 and June 18, i.e. that\r\nhe should have thrown up the line of communication with France by\r\nthe high road, have made ready to retreat on Pampeluna instead of on\r\nBayonne, and have looked forward to making Saragossa his base. After\r\nhaving picked up first Clausel and then so much of the Army of Aragon\r\nas could be collected, he might have got 100,000 men together and have\r\nstarted an offensive campaign[547]. This overlooks the impossibility of\r\ngetting the convoys and train safely along the bad road from Vittoria\r\nto Pampeluna, and the difficulty of making Saragossa, where there were\r\nno great accumulations of stores and munitions, the base of an army\r\nof the size projected. All communication with France would have been\r\nthrown on the hopelessly long and circuitous route from Saragossa to\r\nPerpignan, for the pass by Jaca was impracticable for wheeled traffic.\r\nCertainly Joseph would have had to destroy, as a preliminary measure to\r\na retreat via Salvatierra or Pampeluna, the greater part of his train.\r\nAnd what would have become of his wretched horde of refugees?\r\n\r\nAnother school of critics--among them Belmas--urge that while it was\r\nperfectly correct to cling as a primary necessity to the great road to\r\nFrance, Vittoria was not the right point at which to defend it, but the\r\npass of Salinas. Jourdan’s objection that the cavalry would be useless\r\nin the mountains is declared to have little weight, and his dread of\r\nfamine to be groundless. For Wellington could not have remained for\r\nmany days in front of the passes--he must have attacked at once a very\r\nformidable position, or Foy and the other troops in Biscay would have\r\nhad time to join the King; and with 15,000 extra bayonets the French\r\nwould have been hard to dislodge. The danger to Clausel would have\r\nbeen not very great, since Wellington would not have dared to detach a\r\nforce sufficient to crush him, while the main French army was in his\r\nfront, intact and ready to resume the offensive. And on the other flank\r\nBiscay, no doubt, would have been exposed to an invasion by Giron’s\r\nGalicians, when Foy had withdrawn its garrisons to join the main army.\r\nBut it is improbable that this movement would have been backed by any\r\nlarge section of the Anglo-Portuguese force; for Wellington, as his\r\nprevious action showed, was intending to keep all his own old divisions\r\nin one body. He would not have risked any of his own troops between\r\nthe Pyrenees and the sea, by trying to thrust them in on the back of\r\nthe French position, to Durango or Mondragon. And if Giron alone went\r\nto Bilbao and Durango, his presence in that direction, and any threats\r\nwhich he might make on the King’s rear, would be tiresome rather than\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, whatever the general policy of Jourdan and Joseph\r\nshould have been, their particular dispositions for occupying the\r\nVittoria position were very faulty. It was as well known to every\r\npractical soldier then as it is now, that a normal river-position\r\ncannot be held by a continuous line of troops placed at the water’s\r\nedge. For there will be loops and bends at which the ground on one’s\r\nown side is commanded and enfiladed by higher ground on the enemy’s\r\nside. If troops are pushed forward into such bends, they will be\r\ncrushed by artillery fire, or run danger of being cut off by attacks\r\non the neck of the loop in their rear[548]. Unless the general who\r\nhas to defend a river front is favoured with a stream in front of him\r\nabsolutely straight, and with all the commanding ground on his own side\r\n(an unusual chance), he must rather look to arranging his army in such\r\na fashion as to hold as strong points all the favourable sections of\r\nthe front, while the unfavourable ones must be watched from suitable\r\npositions drawn back from the water’s edge. By judicious disposition\r\nof artillery, the occupation and preparation of villages, woods, or\r\nother cover, and (if necessary) the throwing up of trenches, the enemy,\r\nthough he cannot be prevented from crossing the river at certain\r\npoints, can be kept from debouching out of the sections of the hither\r\nbank which he has mastered. And if he loads up the captured ground\r\nwith heavy masses of troops which cannot get forward, he will suffer\r\nterribly from artillery fire, while if he does not hold them strongly,\r\nhe will be liable to counter-attacks, which will throw the troops who\r\nhave crossed back into the river. The most elementary precaution for\r\nthe general on the defensive to take is, of course, to blow up all\r\nbridges, and to place artillery to command all fords, also to have\r\nlocal reserves ready at a proper distance behind every section where a\r\npassage is likely to be tried[549].\r\n\r\nWe may excuse Joseph and Jourdan for not entrenching all the weak\r\nsections of their front--hasty field works were little used in the\r\nPeninsular War; indeed the trenches which Wellington threw up on the\r\nsecond day of Fuentes de Oñoro were an almost unique instance of such\r\nan expedient. But the other precautions to be taken were commonplaces\r\nof contemporary tactics. And they were entirely neglected. The front\r\nliable to attack was very long for the size of the defending army:\r\nwhole sections of it were neglected. Bridges and fords were numerous\r\non the Zadorra: incredible as it may seem, not one of eleven bridges\r\nbetween Durana to the north and Nanclares to the south was blown up.\r\nThe numerous fords seem not to have been known accurately to either\r\nthe attacking or the defending generals, but some of the most obvious\r\nof them were ignored in Joseph’s original disposition of his troops.\r\nSeveral alike of bridges and fords were lightly watched by cavalry\r\nonly, with no further precaution taken. What is most astonishing is to\r\nfind that bridges which were actually used by French exploring parties\r\non June 20th, so that their existence was thoroughly realized, were\r\nfound intact and in some cases unguarded on the 21st[550]. The fact\r\nwould seem to be that the King’s head-quarters staff was dominated\r\nby a false idea: that Wellington’s attack would be delivered on the\r\nsouth part of the river front, from the defile of Puebla to the bridge\r\nof Villodas; and that the troops discovered on the Murguia road were\r\nLonga’s irregulars only, bound on a demonstration. An acute British\r\nobserver remarked that the French position had two main defects--the\r\nmore important one was that it faced the wrong way[551]: this was quite\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nThe final arrangement, as taken up on the morning of June 20 was that\r\nthe Army of the South arrayed itself so as to block the debouches from\r\nthe defile of La Puebla and the bridges immediately up-stream from\r\nit--those of Nanclares and Villodas. Gazan did not occupy the entrance\r\nof the defile of La Puebla--to do so he must have stretched his line\r\nfarther south and east than his numbers permitted. But he held its\r\nexits, with some voltigeur companies from Maransin’s brigade, perched\r\nhigh up on the culminating ground immediately above the river.\r\n\r\nFrom this lofty point on the heights of Puebla his first line stretched\r\nnorth-eastward along a line of low hills, past the villages of Subijana\r\n(low down and not far from the Puebla heights) and Ariñez (on the high\r\nroad, at the spot where it crosses the position), a dominating point\r\non the sky-line. The right wing nearly reached to the Zadorra at the\r\nspot where it makes the ‘hairpin bend’ alluded to above. But the solid\r\noccupation by formed troops did not extend so far: there were only a\r\ncavalry regiment and three guns watching the bridge of Mendoza[552],\r\nand a single company of voltigeurs watching that of Villodas. The\r\ndisposition of the units was, counting from the French left, first\r\nMaransin’s brigade occupying Subijana, next Conroux’s division in a\r\nsingle line on the slopes to the north of the village of Zumelzu,\r\nwith a battalion holding a wood in front on lower ground. Then came\r\nDaricau’s division, one brigade in front line across the high road,\r\nthe other brigade (St. Pol’s) in reserve north of the road, and in\r\nrear of Leval’s division, which was deployed on the prominent height\r\nin front of the village of Ariñez, which formed the end of the main\r\nposition. Between Leval and the Zadorra there was only Avy’s few\r\nsquadrons of light horse, watching the bridge of Mendoza. Nearly a mile\r\nto the rear of the main line Villatte’s division stood in reserve, on\r\nthe heights on the other side of Ariñez, and with it Pierre Soult’s\r\ncavalry. The position was heavily gunned, as artillery support went\r\nin those days. Each of the three front-line divisions had its battery\r\nwith it--a fourth belonging to Pierre Soult’s cavalry was placed\r\non a knoll in front of the position, from which it could sweep the\r\napproaches from the bridge of Nanclares. In reserve behind Ariñez was\r\nnot only Villatte’s battery, but two others drawn from the general\r\nartillery park, and during the early stage of the battle another pair\r\nof batteries, belonging to the Army of Portugal, were sent to join\r\nLeval’s divisional guns on the north end of the position. Gazan had\r\ntherefore some 54 pieces in hand, without counting the half-battery of\r\nhorse artillery belonging to Digeon’s dragoons, which was absent far to\r\nhis extreme right, by the banks of the upper Zadorra.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of a mile behind Gazan’s reserves, the whole Army of\r\nthe Centre was deployed on each side of the high road, Darmagnac’s\r\ndivision north of it in front of Zuazo, Cassagne’s division south of\r\nit, level with Gomecha. Treillard’s dragoons were behind Cassagne;\r\nAvy’s chasseurs (as has been mentioned above) were watching the Zadorra\r\non the right.\r\n\r\nIn the original order of battle of the 20th the Army of Portugal had\r\nbeen in third line, a mile behind the Army of the Centre, on a level\r\nwith the villages of Ali and Armentia. But when Digeon’s dragoons\r\nreported in the afternoon that they had discovered Longa’s column on\r\nthe Murguia road, it was decided that a flank guard must be thrown out\r\nin that direction, to cover Vittoria and the high road to France from\r\npossible raids. Wherefore Reille was told that it would be his duty to\r\nprovide against this danger. He took out Menne’s brigade of Sarrut’s\r\ndivision from the line, pushed it over the Zadorra, and established\r\nit in a position level with Aranguiz on the Murguia road, a mile and\r\nmore beyond the river. Late at night, apparently on a report from a\r\ndeserter that there were British troops behind Longa[553]--(indeed the\r\nman said that Wellington himself was on the Bilbao road)--Reille took\r\noff the other brigade of Sarrut’s division in the same direction, and\r\nsent it with Curto’s regiments of light horse to join Menne. There\r\nremained in front of Vittoria of infantry only Lamartinière’s division,\r\nand the King’s Guards; but there was a very large body of cavalry in\r\nreserve--Tilly’s and Digeon’s dragoon divisions of the Army of the\r\nSouth, the King’s two Guard regiments of lancers, and the bulk of the\r\nhorse of the Army of Portugal, Boyer’s dragoons and Mermet’s chasseurs:\r\nthere must have been 5,000 sabres or more in hand.\r\n\r\nOne further precaution was taken--lest the enemy might be moving\r\nagainst the high road to France from points even more to the north\r\nthan Murguia, a trifling force was sent to cover the exit of the\r\n_chaussée_ from the pass of Salinas; this was the Spanish ‘division’\r\nof Casapalacios belonging to the Army of the Centre, strengthened by\r\nsome scraps of the French troops of the Army of the North, which had\r\ncome in from minor garrisons during the recent retreat. Casapalacios’\r\n_Afrancesados_, nominally three regiments strong, were under 2,000\r\nbayonets--they had with them five weak squadrons of their own nation,\r\na half-battery, also Spanish, and an uncertain (but small) French\r\nauxiliary force, which included a battalion of the 3rd Line, part of\r\nthe 15th Chasseurs, and a section of guns equipped from the artillery\r\ndépôt of the Army of the North, which had long been established at\r\nVittoria and had not been sent to the rear[554]. Casapalacios took post\r\nat Durana, covering the bridge of that village, the most northerly one\r\non the Zadorra: the French battalion was at Gamarra Menor on the other\r\nside of the water.\r\n\r\nWellington spent the 20th in arranging for the general attack, which\r\nhe had determined to deliver if Joseph stood his ground. The plan was\r\nambitious, for the battlefield was far larger than any on which the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese Army had ever fought before, and the numbers available\r\nwere 30,000 more than they had been at Salamanca or Bussaco, and more\r\nthan double those of Fuentes de Oñoro. Moreover, he intended to operate\r\nwith a great detached turning force against the enemy’s flank and rear,\r\na thing that he had only once done before--at Salamanca--and then only\r\nwith a single division. The battle plan was essentially a time-problem:\r\nhe had to arrange for the simultaneous appearance of four separate\r\nmasses in front of the French position. All started from parallel\r\npoints in the valley of the Bayas, but the obstacles in front of them\r\nwere of very varying difficulty, and the distances to be covered were\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\n(1) Hill, with the large 2nd Division (four brigades), Silveira’s\r\nPortuguese division, Morillo’s Spaniards, and V. Alten’s and Fane’s\r\nlight dragoons, 20,000 sabres and bayonets in all, was to cross the\r\nZadorra completely outside the extreme French left wing, to storm the\r\nheights of Puebla, which formed the end of Gazan’s line, and then,\r\nadvancing from the defile, to strike at Subijana de Alava with his main\r\nbody, while continuing to thrust his flank along the heights above,\r\nwhich dominated the whole region, and extended far behind the enemy’s\r\nleft wing.\r\n\r\n(2) Two parallel columns were to march from the camps on the Bayas;\r\none consisting of the 4th and Light Divisions, R. Hill’s, Grant’s, and\r\nPonsonby’s cavalry brigades, and D’Urban’s Portuguese horse, was to\r\nadvance by the country road from Subijana-Morillas to the two bridges\r\nof Nanclares. Opposite those passages and the neighbouring ones it was\r\nto deploy, and to attack the French centre, when Hill should have got a\r\nfooting on the Puebla heights and in the plain by Subijana. The second\r\ncolumn, consisting of the 3rd and 7th Divisions, was to move from Zuazo\r\nand Anda on the Bayas across the high mountain called Monte Arrato by\r\na country track, and to descend into the valley of the Zadorra at Las\r\nGuetas, opposite the bridge of Mendoza, up-stream from the ‘hairpin\r\nbend’. In this position it would be almost in the rear of Gazan’s right\r\nwing above Villodas: it was to attack at once on reaching its ground,\r\nif the progress of Hill on the south was seen to be satisfactory. ‘The\r\nmovement to be regulated from the right: although these columns are to\r\nmake such movements in advance as may be evidently necessary to favour\r\nthe progress of the two columns on their right, they are not to descend\r\ninto the low ground toward Vittoria or the great road.’ The total\r\nstrength of the four divisions and cavalry of this section of the army\r\nwas about 30,000 sabres and bayonets.\r\n\r\n(3) Graham’s column-head was at Olano, three miles in front of Murguia,\r\nand six from the Zadorra. He had in front Longa’s Spanish infantry,\r\nwith whom Anson’s light dragoons were to join up when operations should\r\nbegin. Behind were the 1st and 5th Divisions, Pack’s and Bradford’s\r\nPortuguese brigades, and Bock’s heavy dragoons. The total force was\r\nabout 20,000 men of all nations. As an afterthought on the 20th\r\nWellington directed Giron, who was to reach Orduña that day, to come\r\ndown to the upper Bayas in Graham’s rear, where he would act as a\r\nsupport if necessary. The object of this order is not quite obvious.\r\nGiron came down too late for the battle, arriving at Murguia only in\r\nthe afternoon. It is known from his own dispatches that Wellington\r\nover-estimated Reille’s force, which Graham had to fight, not knowing\r\nof Maucune’s departure[555], and Giron may have been intended to add\r\nweight to the attack in this quarter. His troops would, apparently,\r\nhave been more usefully placed if they had been sent from Murguia to\r\nattack the unguarded upper fords of the Zadorra.\r\n\r\nThe orders issued to Graham gave him a rather perplexing choice of\r\naction. He was (like the 3rd and 7th Divisions) to guide himself by\r\nwhat was going on upon his right: he must get in touch at once with\r\nthe centre columns; he might attack if it was obviously profitable\r\nto the main advance, but he was to avoid letting his whole corps be\r\ndrawn into close action in front of Vittoria, for his main object must\r\nbe to turn the enemy’s position, by getting round its right wing and\r\ncutting the great road to France. The lack of precise direction in this\r\norder is, no doubt, a testimony to Wellington’s confidence in Graham’s\r\njudgement. But it cast a grave responsibility on him: if he had been\r\ntold simply that he was to turn the French right and seize the great\r\n_chaussée_, matters would have been simple. But he is given leave to\r\nattack frontally if circumstances farther down the line seem to make\r\nsuch a policy desirable: yet he must not attack so heavily as to make\r\nhis great turning movement impossible. It must be confessed that the\r\ndifficult problem was not well solved that day by the gallant old\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe whole day of the 20th was spent in getting the columns into order,\r\nand the arrangements for the attacks synchronized. Wellington took a\r\nsurvey of all the routes in person, as his wont was. It was not till\r\nlate in the afternoon that he became certain from the dispositions of\r\nthe enemy that an eleventh hour retreat was not contemplated by the\r\nKing[556]. The timing was that Hill, who had a few miles to march,\r\nshould attack at eight in the morning, that both Graham and the column\r\nconsisting of the 3rd and 7th Divisions should get into position by\r\nthe same hour, and make ready to attack, when it was clear that the\r\nflank movement of Hill had already begun and was making good progress.\r\nMeanwhile the other central column, the Light and 4th Divisions, should\r\ncross when Hill had won the defile of Puebla and room to debouch beyond\r\nit, but not before. The rather late hour fixed, in a month when dawn\r\ncomes at 4 a.m., was dictated by the fact that Hill had a river to\r\ncross, and the 3rd and 7th Divisions mountain tracks to follow, which\r\nneither could have negotiated in the dark. Some hours of daylight\r\nwere needed to get them into position. Even so the brigades of the\r\nleft-centre column were several hours late at their rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe French commanders, as we have seen, made no move on the 20th, save\r\nto hurry off convoys and to throw back Reille on the north-west flank\r\nof Vittoria, to protect the royal _chaussée_ and the two Bilbao roads.\r\nJourdan wrote to Clarke that evening a perfectly sensible dispatch\r\nas to the difficulties of the situation, but one which showed that\r\nhe was wholly unaware that he might be forced to a general action\r\nwithin the next twelve hours. All depended, he said, on Clausel’s\r\nprompt arrival: if he should come up on the 21st there was no danger:\r\nif he delayed, the army might have to choose between two tiresome\r\nalternatives--a retreat on the pass of Salinas and one on Pampeluna.\r\nIf Wellington, as he suspected, was making a great turning movement by\r\nOrduña and Durango, the army would be forced to take the wretched road\r\nSalvatierra-Pampeluna. ‘The King does not yet know what decision he\r\nwill have to make: if General Clausel delays his junction much longer,\r\nhe will be forced to choose the retreat into Navarre.’ Of any idea that\r\nWellington was about to attack next morning the dispatch shows no sign.\r\n\r\nJourdan had been indisposed all that day--he was laid up in bed\r\nwith a feverish attack. This caused the postponement of a general\r\nreconnaissance of the position, which he and his King had intended to\r\ncarry out together. They rode forth, however, at 6 a.m. on the 21st.\r\n‘No intelligence had come to hand,’ writes Jourdan in his memoirs,\r\n‘which could cause us to foresee an instant attack. We arrived at the\r\nposition by Zuazo, from which Count Reille had been recently moved, and\r\nstopped to examine it. Its left rested on the mountain-chain in the\r\ndirection of Berostigueta, its right came down to the Zadorra behind\r\nLa Hermandad and Crispijana. It is dominating, yet not over steep, and\r\nhas all along it good artillery emplacement for many batteries. It\r\nconnected itself much better than does the Ariñez position with the\r\nground about Aranguiz now occupied by Reille, which might be heavily\r\nattacked. Struck with the advantages of this position, the King\r\nappeared inclined to bring back the Army of the South to occupy it, and\r\nto place the Army of the Centre between it and the Army of Portugal.\r\nThe three armies would have been closer together, and more able to give\r\neach other rapid assistance; and the eye of the Commander-in-Chief\r\ncould have swept around the whole of this more concentrated field\r\nin one glance. This change of dispositions would probably have been\r\ncarried out on the 20th if Marshal Jourdan had not been indisposed, and\r\nmight perhaps have prevented the catastrophe that was to come. But the\r\nofficer sent to call General Gazan to confer with the King came back\r\nto say that the general could not leave his troops, as an attack on\r\nhim was developing. It was judged too late to change position. Riding\r\nto the front of Ariñez, to a long hill occupied by Leval’s division,\r\non the right of the Army of the South, the King saw that in fact the\r\nenemy was on the move. About eight o’clock the posts on the mountain\r\nreported that the Allies had passed the Zadorra above La Puebla: a\r\nstrong column was coming up the high road and the defile, a smaller one\r\nhad diverged to its right and was climbing the mountain itself. General\r\nAvy, sent on reconnaissance beyond the Zadorra on the side of Mendoza,\r\nreported at the same time that a large corps was coming in on Tres\r\nPuentes behind the rear of General Leval. And he could see signs in the\r\nwoods opposite, which seemed to indicate the march of other troops in\r\nthe direction of the bridge of Nanclares. No news had yet come in from\r\nReille, but we prepared ourselves to hear ere long that he, too, was\r\nattacked[557]’.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to comment on the character of a Head-quarters where\r\na passing indisposition of the Chief of the Staff causes all movements\r\nto be postponed for eighteen hours, at a moment when a general action\r\nis obviously possible. But it is necessary to point out that the\r\nexisting dislocation of the troops left three miles of the Zadorra\r\nfront between Reille’s left and Gazan’s right unguarded when the battle\r\nbegan, and that this had been the case throughout the preceding day.\r\nAnd during that day who was responsible for the fact that not a single\r\none of the eleven bridges between the defile of La Puebla and Durana\r\nhad been ruined and only three obstructed[558]? Gazan must take a good\r\ndeal of responsibility, no less than Jourdan.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock on the morning of the 21st the action commenced, on a\r\nmost beautiful clear day, contrasting wonderfully with the heavy rain\r\nof the 19th and intermittent showers on the 20th. Every hill-crest road\r\nand village for twenty miles was visible with surprising sharpness, so\r\nmuch so that incidents occurring at a great distance were easily to be\r\nfollowed by the naked eye, still more easily by the staff officer’s\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nThe clash began, as Wellington had intended, on the extreme right. Here\r\nHill’s columns crossed the Zadorra, where it broadened out below the\r\ndefile of La Puebla, far outside the French line. The 2nd Division led\r\nup the high road, with Cadogan’s brigade heading the column; but before\r\nthey entered the narrows, Morillo’s Spaniards were pushed forward on\r\ntheir right, through a wood which covered the lower slopes, to seize\r\nthe spur of the Puebla heights immediately above the road. Till this\r\nwas cleared, it would be impossible to move the 2nd Division forward.\r\nEye-witnesses describe the deploying of the Spanish column as clearly\r\nvisible from the high ground on the Monte Arrato heights: the first\r\nbrigade appeared emerging from the woods below, then came stiffer\r\nground, ‘so steep that while moving up it they looked as if they were\r\nlying on their faces or crawling[559]’ Then the smoke of the French\r\nskirmishing fire began to be visible on the crest, while Morillo’s\r\nsecond brigade, deployed behind the first, went up the heights in\r\nsupport. The enemy, who was not in great strength at first, gave way,\r\nand the Estremadurans won the sky-line, formed there, and began to\r\ndrive up from the first summit to the next above it. This also they\r\nwon, but then came to stand--Gazan had pushed up first one and then\r\nthe other of the two regiments of Maransin’s brigade from his left, on\r\nthe main position, to support the voltigeur companies which had been\r\nthe only troops originally placed on this lofty ground. Hill, seeing\r\nthe advance on the mountain stop, sent up, to help Morillo, Colonel\r\nCadogan, with his own regiment the 71st, and all the light companies of\r\nCadogan’s and Byng’s brigades. This turned the fight, and after a stiff\r\nstruggle for the second summit, in which Morillo was severely wounded,\r\nMaransin’s brigade was turned back and flung down hill: it halted and\r\nre-formed low down on the slope, losing the crest completely.\r\n\r\nHaving his flank now reasonably safe, Hill turned off the other two\r\nbattalions of Cadogan’s brigade to follow the 71st, and then pushed\r\nhis second British brigade (O’Callaghan’s) up the defile of La Puebla,\r\nand deployed it on the open ground opposite the village of Subijana de\r\nAlava, which lay near the high road, and was the first obstacle to be\r\ncarried if the whole corps was to issue forth and attack the French\r\nleft. One battery moved up with the brigade, and got into action on\r\na slope to its right. The rest of the 2nd Division and Silveira’s\r\nPortuguese issued from the defile, ready to act as reserve either to\r\nMorillo on the heights or O’Callaghan in the open ground. Meanwhile the\r\nenemy could be seen dispatching troops from his reserves, to attack the\r\nspurs of the mountain which had been won by Morillo and Cadogan. For\r\nthe heights of Puebla commanded all the left flank of the main French\r\nposition, and, if Allied troops pushed along them any further, Gazan’s\r\nline would be completely turned. Jourdan says that his orders were\r\nthat Maransin’s brigade should have attacked, with a whole division in\r\nsupport, but that Gazan took upon him the responsibility of sending in\r\nMaransin alone, and only later, when the latter had been beaten down\r\nfrom the crest, first Rey’s brigade of Conroux’s division and then St.\r\nPol’s reserve brigade of Daricau’s division, from the hill on the right\r\nbehind Leval. It would seem that Daricau’s two regiments took post on\r\nthe slopes behind Subijana, where there was a gap in the line, owing\r\nto Maransin’s departure, while Rey and his brigade went up the Puebla\r\nheights, to try to head off Morillo’s and Cadogan’s attack.\r\n\r\nIn this it was wholly unsuccessful: after a severe struggle on\r\nthe crest, in which Cadogan was mortally wounded[560], the French\r\nreinforcements were checked and routed: the Allied troops began to push\r\nforward again on the heights, and were getting right round the flank\r\nof Gazan’s left wing, while Maransin’s troops on the lower slopes were\r\nbeing contained by the 92nd and 50th, the rear regiments of Cadogan’s\r\nbrigade, and Daricau’s were hotly engaged with O’Callaghan’s three\r\nbattalions, which occupied Subijana and then attacked the hillside\r\nabove it, but failed for some time to secure a lodgement there.\r\n\r\nJourdan was by this time growing anxious, and not without reason, at\r\nthe rapid progress of the Allies on the Puebla heights. He ordered\r\nGazan to send up at once his only remaining reserve, Villatte’s\r\ndivision from the height behind Ariñez, to gain the crest at a point\r\nfarther east than any that the enemy could reach, and to attack in\r\nmass along it. In order that he might not be forestalled on the\r\nsummit, Villatte was told to march by a long détour, through the\r\nvillage of Esquivel far to the east, where there was a country road\r\ndebouching from the _chaussée_. Indeed so perturbed was the Marshal by\r\nthe threat to his left, that he suspected further turning movements\r\nin this quarter, and sent orders for Tilly’s dragoons, from the\r\ncavalry reserve, to ride out by Berostigueta to the Trevino road, to\r\nsee if there were no British columns pressing in from that quarter.\r\nHe also directed D’Erlon to move one of his two infantry divisions,\r\nCassagne’s, in the same direction, to support Tilly if necessary.\r\nGazan, if we may credit his long and contentious report on the battle,\r\nsuggested to Jourdan that it was dangerous to disgarnish his centre,\r\nand to push so many troops to his left, while it was still uncertain\r\nwhether Wellington’s column-heads, visible on the other side of the\r\nZadorra, were not about to move. Might not Hill’s attack be a feint,\r\nintended to draw off the French reserves in an eccentric direction?\r\nThe Marshal, says Gazan, then declared in a loud voice, so that all\r\naround could hear ‘that the enemy’s movements opposite our right are\r\nmere demonstrations, to which no attention should be paid, and that if\r\nthe battle were lost it would be because the heights oi the left of\r\nSubijana remained in the enemy’s power[561].’ Then lay the real danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrders were given that when Villatte should have got on the crest of\r\nthe mountain, and should be delivering his attack, a simultaneous move\r\nforward was to be made by Conroux, and the brigades of Maransin and St.\r\nPol, to cast the enemy out of Subijana, as well as off the heights of\r\nPuebla. It is interesting to note that Hill had as yet only engaged two\r\nBritish brigades, and one small Spanish division, and had succeeded in\r\nattracting against himself a much larger force--the whole of Conroux’s\r\nand Villatte’s divisions, and the two brigades of Maransin and St. Pol.\r\nIn the French centre and right there remained now only Leval’s division\r\nand the remaining brigade of Daricau’s, and in reserve there was only\r\none of D’Erlon’s divisions, since the other had gone off on a wild\r\ngoose chase toward the Trevino road. Wellington could have wished for\r\nnothing better.\r\n\r\nBut by the time that the French counter-attack on Hill’s corps was\r\ndeveloping, matters were beginning to look lively all along the line of\r\nthe Zadorra, and the combat on the heights was growing into a general\r\naction. It was now about eleven o’clock, and Wellington had been for\r\nsome time established on a high bank above the river, facing the centre\r\nof the French position, to the left of the village and bridges of\r\nNanclares, from which he could sweep with his glass the whole landscape\r\nfrom the heights of La Puebla to the bridge of Mendoza. To his left and\r\nright the Light and 4th Divisions lay in two masses, a mile or more\r\nback from the river, and hidden very carefully in folds of the Monte\r\nArrato, the battalions in contiguous close column lying down in hollow\r\nroads or behind outcrops of rock, and showing as little as possible.\r\nThe great mass of cavalry in reserve, four brigades, had not been\r\nbrought over the sky-line yet, and lay some distance to the rear. Only\r\nGrant’s hussars were near the Light Division, dismounted and standing\r\nto their horses in covered ground. The French lines were perfectly\r\nvisible, ‘unmasked, without a bush to prevent the sweeping of their\r\nartillery, the charging of their cavalry, or the fire of their musketry\r\nacting with full effect on those who should attempt to cross the\r\nbridges in their front, which it was necessary to carry before we could\r\nbegin the attack on their centre[562],’ King Joseph and his staff were\r\nconspicuous on the round hill before Ariñez.\r\n\r\nHill’s advance having begun, and made good progress, Wellington was\r\nwatching for the two other movements which ought to have coincided with\r\nthe attempt to cross the river at Nanclares for the frontal attack.\r\nThey had neither of them developed as yet: at least nothing was to be\r\nseen of the 3rd and 7th Divisions on the down-slope of the lofty Monte\r\nArrato, and there had not yet been any heavy burst of cannonading\r\nfrom the upper Zadorra (which was not visible from the spot where the\r\nCommander-in-Chief had placed himself), to tell that Graham was engaged.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the comparative silence in this quarter was undoubtedly\r\nthe wording of Wellington’s orders to Graham, which left so much to\r\nthe judgement of the commander of the great turning column. He had\r\nbeen placed, almost from the start of his march, in the presence of a\r\nsecondary problem. Reille, as we have seen, had been given on the 20th\r\nthe charge of the upper Zadorra and the great road to France. Hoping\r\nthat he had only Longa’s Spaniards in front of him, and judging that\r\nit would be well to keep them as far from the road and the river as\r\npossible, the commander of the Army of Portugal had placed Sarrut’s\r\ndivision and a brigade of Mermet’s light horse in an advanced position\r\na mile and more in front of the river, on a ridge flanking the main\r\nBilbao road, above the village of Aranguiz. Lamartinière’s division\r\nand Boyer’s and Digeon’s dragoons had been left on the nearer bank.\r\nWhen therefore Graham, marching down from Olano, neared Aranguiz,\r\nhe found a considerable French force blocking the way. Remembering\r\nhis orders to look to the right, to adapt his movements to those of\r\nthe troops in that direction, and not to be drawn into unnecessary\r\nfighting, he halted for some time, to see how matters were going on the\r\ncritical wing, and meanwhile deployed alongside of Longa’s men in his\r\nfront, Pack’s Portuguese brigade and Anson’s light dragoons, with the\r\n5th Division in support, before Sarrut’s position. He also detached\r\nBradford’s Portuguese to his right, with the idea of getting in touch\r\nwith the troops in that direction. Reille, who was present in person\r\nwith his advanced guard, saw with dismay the depth of the column\r\ndescending upon him, and recognized that he must fall back and hold the\r\nline of the Zadorra, the only possible front on which he could oppose\r\nsuch an enemy. About midday or a little later Graham ‘thought himself\r\njustified in advancing, in order to draw the enemy’s attention to his\r\nright, and so assist the progress of the army from the side of Miranda\r\n(i. e. Hill’s column), where the enemy seemed to be making an obstinate\r\nresistance in the successive strong positions which the country\r\nafforded[563].’ The very moment that Graham sent forth Longa and Pack\r\nto advance, the French retired by order, not without some skirmishing,\r\nin which the 4th Caçadores stormed the hill just above Aranguiz. But\r\nneither side had any appreciable losses.\r\n\r\nGraham could now advance to within a mile of the Zadorra, and was\r\nin command of the plain-ground as far as the villages of Abechuco,\r\nand Gamarra Mayor and Menor. All three are on the northern or right\r\nbank of the river, and Reille had determined to hold them as _têtes\r\nde pont_ covering the bridges. They had been hastily barricaded, and\r\nthe artillery of the Army of Portugal had been placed on the opposite\r\nbank in a line of batteries, ready to sweep the open ground over which\r\nan assault on the villages must be launched. Graham had therefore to\r\ndeploy for a formal attack on the new position. He sent Longa up-stream\r\nand over the hills, to attack Gamarra Menor and Durana, placed Oswald\r\nand the 5th Division, with a section of Lawson’s battery, over against\r\nGamarra Mayor, and drew out the 1st Division and the two Portuguese\r\nbrigades opposite Abechuco, which would have to be taken before the\r\nbridge of Arriaga could be attacked. Keeping in mind Wellington’s main\r\npurpose, indicated in his orders, of cutting the great road to France,\r\nhe told Longa and Oswald on the flank that they might push hard,\r\nwhile he seems to have acted in a much more leisurely way in front of\r\nAbechuco, where no attack was launched till actual orders had been\r\nreceived from head-quarters bidding him press harder. But meanwhile\r\nLonga took Gamarra Menor from the French battalion of the 3rd Line,\r\nand then, pushing on, came into collision at Durana bridge with his\r\nrenegade compatriots the Franco-Spanish division of Casapalacios.\r\nAs the great road to Bayonne actually passes through Durana, and was\r\nnow under fire from Longa’s skirmishers, it may be said to have been\r\nblocked for all practical purposes at this early stage of the battle.\r\nIt was not till the afternoon, however, that Longa succeeded in\r\nstorming the bridge and occupying the village, thus formally breaking\r\nthe enemy’s main line of communication with France--to save which King\r\nJoseph had risked his all. Apparently he was hampered by having no\r\nartillery, while the Franco-Spaniards had some four or five guns with\r\nthem, bearing on the bridge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robinson’s brigade of the 5th Division had stormed Gamarra\r\nMayor, defended by the French 118th and 119th--Gauthier’s brigade of\r\nLamartinière’s division. This was a brilliant and costly affair--it\r\nbeing no light matter to attack in column of battalions the barricaded\r\nstreets of a compact village. The British, however, burst in--Colonel\r\nBrooke with the 1/4th being the first to force an entrance: the French\r\nabandoned three guns which had been placed in the barricades, and fell\r\nback in disorder across the bridge. General Robinson endeavoured to\r\nimprove the success by instant pursuit, but the French had guns bearing\r\non the bridge, which swept away the first platoons that tried to cross\r\nit. Very few men reached the other side, and they were shot down before\r\nthey could establish a lodgement on the farther bank. It was necessary\r\nto halt, re-form, and bring up more artillery before the attack could\r\nbe repeated.\r\n\r\nIt was now past two o’clock, and the noise of Graham’s attack was\r\nsufficiently audible all down the British line, and was carrying dismay\r\nto French head-quarters. But what of the other column, that of the 3rd\r\nand 7th Divisions, which was to appear on the middle Zadorra opposite\r\nGazan’s almost unguarded flank, in the direction of the bridge of\r\nMendoza? It was overdue, now that both the large flanking corps were\r\nseriously engaged, and the attention of the enemy attracted toward\r\nthem. But before the missing column came into action, there had been an\r\nunexpected modification of the position in the right centre. At 11.30\r\nWellington appeared before the Light Division, and told Alten to move\r\nit more to the left, so as to be over and above the bridge of Villodas,\r\nwhich it would have to attack at the moment of general advance,\r\nleaving the two bridges by Nanclares to the 4th Division and the\r\ncavalry. So rough and wooded was the ground that the division, moving\r\nin a hollow way, was established less than 300 yards from the brink of\r\nthe Zadorra and the French line, without attracting the notice of the\r\nenemy. An officer of the 43rd writes: ‘I felt anxious to obtain a view,\r\nand walking leisurely between the trees found myself at the edge of\r\nthe wood, in clear sight of the enemy’s cannon, planted with lighted\r\nmatches and ready to apply them[564]. Had our attack begun here, the\r\nFrench could never have stood to their guns, so near were they to the\r\nthicket--our Riflemen would have annihilated them.’ The British bank of\r\nthe Zadorra here completely commanded the bridge and the French bank,\r\nwhich accounts for the fact that the enemy’s artillery did not detect\r\nthe approach of such a large body of troops as the Light Division. But\r\nafter a time a bickering fire across the river between skirmishers\r\non both sides broke out at several points, and some voltigeurs even\r\npressed across Villodas bridge, and had to be cast back again by the\r\nskirmishers of the 2/95th.\r\n\r\nThere was to be, however, no attempt to pass this bridge as yet by the\r\nBritish. While Wellington was still with the Light Division, a peasant\r\ncame up to him with the astounding intelligence that the bridge of\r\nTres Puentes, the one at the extreme point of the ‘hairpin-bend’ of\r\nthe Zadorra, was not only unoccupied but unwatched by the enemy: he\r\noffered to guide any troops sent to it. The Commander-in-Chief made\r\nup his mind at once to seize this crossing, which would outflank the\r\nFrench position at Villodas, and told the peasant to lead Kempt’s\r\nbrigade of the Light Division to the unwatched point, about a mile and\r\na half to the left. ‘The brigade moved off by threes at a rapid pace,\r\nalong a very uneven and circuitous path, concealed from the observation\r\nof the French by high rocks, and reached the narrow bridge, which\r\ncrossed the river to the hamlet of Yruna (part of the scattered village\r\nof Tres Puentes). The 1st Rifles led the way, and the whole brigade\r\nfollowing passed at a run, with firelocks and rifles ready cocked, and\r\nascended a steep road of fifty yards, at the top of which was an old\r\nchapel. We had no sooner cleared it than we observed a heavy column\r\nof the French on the principal hill, and commanding a bird’s eye view\r\nof us. However, fortunately, a convex bank formed a sort of _tête de\r\npont_, behind which the regiments formed at full speed, without any\r\nword of command. Two round shots now came among us: the second severed\r\nthe head from the body of our bold guide, the Spanish peasant. The\r\nbrigade was so well covered that the enemy soon ceased firing. Our post\r\nwas extraordinary--we were in the elbow of the French position, and\r\nisolated from the rest of the army, within 100 yards of the enemy[565]\r\nand absolutely occupying part of his position, without any attempt\r\nhaving been made to dislodge us.... Sir James Kempt expressed much\r\nwonder at our critical position, without being molested, and sent his\r\naide-de-camp at speed across the river for the 15th Hussars, who came\r\nup singly and at a gallop along the steep path, and dismounted in rear\r\nof our centre. Some French dragoons, coolly and at a slow pace, came\r\nup to within 50 yards of us, to examine, if possible, our strength,\r\nbut a few shots from the Rifles caused them to decamp. We could see\r\nthree bridges within a quarter of a mile of each other, in the elbow\r\nof the enemy’s position. We had crossed the centre one (Tres Puentes),\r\nwhile the other two, right and left (Villodas and Mendoza), were still\r\ncovered by French artillery[566].’\r\n\r\nExpecting to be instantly attacked, and to have to fight hard for the\r\nchapel-knoll on which they had aligned themselves, Kempt’s brigade\r\nspent ‘half an hour of awkward suspense.’ The immunity with which they\r\nhad been allowed to hold their position was suddenly explained by a\r\nmovement which they had not been able to observe. The missing column of\r\nWellington’s army had at last come up, and was plunging with headlong\r\nspeed into the rear of the troops which were facing Kempt, so that the\r\nFrench had no attention to spare for the side-issue in the hairpin-bend\r\nof the Zadorra. Instead of being attacked the brigade was about to\r\nbecome at once an attacking force.\r\n\r\nA word is necessary as to the leading of this column. It had been\r\nplaced by Wellington under Lord Dalhousie, now commanding the 7th\r\nDivision. This was an extraordinary choice, as this officer had been\r\nonly a few months in the Peninsula, and had no experience of the\r\nhigher responsibilities--though he had commanded a brigade in the\r\nWalcheren expedition[567]. But being as Lieutenant-General slightly\r\nsenior to Picton (though they had been gazetted major-generals on\r\nthe same day in 1808), he was entitled to take the command over the\r\nhead of the war-worn and experienced leader of the 3rd Division. The\r\nlatter had been directing one of the great marching columns during the\r\nearly stages of the advance, and was not unnaturally sulky at being\r\ndisplaced. Common report in the army held that he was in disfavour at\r\nHead-Quarters, for intemperate letters complaining of the starving of\r\nhis division during the recent march beyond the Ebro[568]. Be this as\r\nit may, Picton was during the forenoon hours of June 21st in one of his\r\nnot infrequent rages. For though his column had started early, and the\r\n3rd Division had reached Las Guetas, the villages on the south side of\r\nthe Monte Arrato, which were to be its starting-point for the attack on\r\nthe line of the Zadorra, Lord Dalhousie refused to advance farther than\r\nthe edge of the hills, using apparently his discretion in interpreting\r\nthe orders given him ‘to regulate his action from what was going on to\r\nhis right and only to move when it should be ‘evidently necessary’ to\r\nfavour the progress of the columns in that direction. He was obviously\r\nworried by the fact that the two rear brigades of his own division,\r\nBarnes’s and Le Cor’s, had been hindered by an artillery breakdown in\r\nthe steep road behind, and were not yet up, though Cairnes’s battery,\r\nwhich had delayed them, ultimately overtook the leading brigade[569].\r\nHence he used his discretion to wait for formal orders from\r\nHead-Quarters, and to do nothing. Picton, who could note the advance of\r\nHill’s column, and could see that the French were utterly unprepared\r\nfor an attack on the middle Zadorra, chafed bitterly at the delay.\r\n\r\nWe have an interesting picture of him on that morning from\r\neye-witnesses. He was a strange figure--suffering from inflammation\r\nof the eyes, he had put on not his cocked hat but a broad-brimmed\r\nand tall civilian top-hat--the same that may be seen to-day in the\r\nUnited Service Museum. ‘During the struggle on the right the centre\r\nwas inactive. General Picton was impatient, he inquired of every\r\naide-de-camp whether they had any orders for him. As the day wore\r\non, and the fight waxed louder on the right, he became furious, and\r\nobserved to the communicator of these particulars, ‘D--n it! Lord\r\nWellington must have forgotten us.’ It was near noon, and the men were\r\ngetting discontented. Picton’s blood was boiling, his stick was beating\r\nwith rapid strokes upon the mane of his cob. He rode backward and\r\nforward looking in every direction for the arrival of an aide-de-camp,\r\nuntil at last one galloped up from Lord Wellington. He was looking for\r\nLord Dalhousie--the 7th Division had not yet arrived, having to move\r\nover difficult ground. The aide-de-camp checked his horse and asked the\r\ngeneral whether he had seen Lord Dalhousie. Picton was disappointed;\r\nhe had expected that he might at least move now, and in a voice which\r\ndid not gain softness from his feelings, answered in a sharp tone, ‘No,\r\nSir: I have _not_ seen his Lordship, but have you any orders for _me_.’\r\n‘None,’ replied the aide-de-camp. ‘Then, pray Sir, what are the orders\r\nthat you _do_ bring?’ ‘Why,’ answered the officer, ‘that as soon as\r\nLord D. shall commence an attack on that bridge,’ pointing to the one\r\non the left (Mendoza), ‘the 4th and Light are to support him.’ Picton\r\ncould not understand the idea of any other division fighting in his\r\nfront, and drawing himself up to his full height said to the astonished\r\naide-de-camp, ‘You may tell Lord Wellington from me, Sir, that the 3rd\r\nDivision, under my command, shall in less than ten minutes attack that\r\nbridge and carry it, and the 4th and Light may support if they choose.’\r\nHaving thus expressed his intention, he turned from the aide-de-camp\r\nand put himself at the head of his men, who were quickly in motion\r\ntoward the bridge, encouraging them with the bland appellation of ‘Come\r\non, ye rascals! Come on, ye fighting villains[570].’\r\n\r\nTen minutes as the time required to plunge down from the hillside\r\nto a bridge two miles away seems a short estimate. But there is no\r\ndoubt that the advance of the 3rd Division was fast and furious--an\r\neye-witness describes it as shooting like a meteor across the front of\r\nthe still-halted column-head of the 7th Division. The military purist\r\nmay opine that Picton should have waited till he got formal orders\r\nvia Lord Dalhousie to advance. But the moments were precious--Kempt\r\nwas across the Zadorra close by, in an obviously dangerous state of\r\nisolation: the French in a few minutes might be sending infantry to\r\nblock the bridge of Mendoza, which they had so strangely neglected.\r\nThe 7th Division was short of two brigades, and not ready to attack.\r\nWellington’s orders were known, and the situation on the right was\r\nnow such as to justify the permissible advance which they authorized.\r\nNeither Wellington nor Dalhousie in their dispatches give any hint that\r\nPicton’s action was disapproved--complete success justified it.\r\n\r\nPicton had directed Brisbane’s brigade of the 3rd Division straight\r\nupon the bridge of Mendoza, Colville’s upon a ford 300 yards farther\r\nup-stream. Both crossed safely and almost unopposed. The only\r\nFrench troops watching the stream here were Avy’s weak brigade of\r\ncavalry--under 500 sabres--and their three horse-artillery guns\r\ncommanding the bridge. But the latter hardly got into action, for on\r\nPicton’s rapid approach becoming visible, General Kempt threw out\r\nsome companies of the 1/95th under Andrew Barnard, from his point of\r\nvantage on the knoll of Yruna, who opened such a biting fire upon the\r\nhalf battery that the officer in command limbered up and galloped off.\r\nAvy’s chasseurs hovered about in an undecided way--but were not capable\r\neither of defending a bridge or of attacking a brigade in position\r\nupon a steep hill. Wherefore Picton got across with small loss, and\r\nformed his two British brigades on the south side of the river. Power’s\r\nPortuguese rapidly followed Brisbane, as did a little later Grant’s\r\nbrigade of the 7th Division--Lord Dalhousie’s other two brigades (as we\r\nhave already noted) were not yet on the ground. On seeing Picton safely\r\nestablished on the left bank Kempt advanced from his knoll, and formed\r\non the right-rear of the 3rd Division. The trifling French detachment\r\nat the bridge of Villodas--only a voltigeur company--wisely absconded\r\nat full speed on seeing Kempt on the move. The passage there was left\r\ncompletely free for Vandeleur’s brigade of the Light Division, who had\r\nlong been waiting on the opposite steep bank.\r\n\r\nThe British were across the Zadorra in force, and the critical stage of\r\nthe action was about to commence: the hour being between 2 and 3 in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVI: CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF VITTORIA. ROUT OF THE FRENCH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Picton and the 3rd Division, followed by the one available brigade\r\nof the 7th Division, came pouring across the Zadorra on the side of\r\nMendoza, while Kempt debouched from the knoll of Yruna, and Vandeleur\r\ncrossed the bridge of Villodas, the position of Leval’s division became\r\ndesperate. It was about to be attacked in flank by four brigades and\r\nin front by two more, and being one of the weaker divisions of the\r\nArmy of the South, only 4,500 bayonets, was outnumbered threefold. Its\r\noriginal reserve (half Daricau’s division) had gone off to the Puebla\r\nheights hours before: the general army-reserve (Villatte’s division)\r\nhad been sent away in the same direction by Jourdan’s last orders. The\r\nnearest disposable and intact French troops were Darmagnac’s division\r\nof the Army of the Centre--two miles to the rear, in position by Zuazo:\r\nthe other divisions of that army had (as we have seen) gone off on a\r\nwholly unnecessary excursion to watch the Trevino road. The left wing\r\nand centre of the Army of the South was absorbed in the task of keeping\r\nback Hill, and had just begun the counter-attack upon him which Jourdan\r\nhad ordered an hour before.\r\n\r\nThe sudden change in the situation, caused by the very rapid advance of\r\nPicton and the brigades that helped him, was all too evident to King\r\nJoseph and his chief of the staff, as they stood on the hill of Ariñez.\r\nThe whole force of the 3rd division struck diagonally across the short\r\nspace between the river and Leval’s position--Brisbane’s brigade and\r\nPower’s Portuguese making for the French flank, while Colville, higher\r\nup the stream, made for the rear of the hill, in the direction of the\r\nvillage of Margarita. Kempt followed Brisbane in second line, Grant’s\r\nbrigade of the 7th Division, when it crossed at Mendoza, came on behind\r\nColville. So did Vandeleur, from Villodas, after he had pulled down\r\nthe obstructions and got his men over the narrow bridge. Nor was this\r\nall--the 4th Division, so long halted on the scrubby hillside opposite\r\nthe left-hand of the two Nanclares bridges, suddenly started to descend\r\nthe slope at the double-quick, Stubbs’s Portuguese brigade leading.\r\n\r\nJourdan had to make a ‘lightning change’ in all his dispositions.\r\nLeval, obviously doomed if he did not retire quickly, was told to\r\nevacuate his hill and fall back past Ariñez, into which he threw a\r\nregiment to cover his retreat, on to the heights behind it. The two\r\nbrigades of Daricau and Conroux, which had stood on the other side of\r\nthe high road from Leval, were to make a parallel movement back to\r\nthe same line of heights. The other brigades of Daricau and Conroux,\r\nwith Maransin--now deeply engaged some with O’Callaghan and others\r\nwith the 50th and 92nd--were to abandon the attack which they had just\r\nbegun, and which had somewhat pushed back the British advance. They\r\ntoo must go back to the slopes behind Ariñez. It would take longer to\r\nrecall Villatte, who was now far up on the crest of the mountain to the\r\nleft, engaged with Morillo’s Spaniards and the 71st. But this attack\r\nalso must be broken off. Lastly, to fill the gap between Leval’s new\r\nposition and the Zadorra, the Army of the Centre must come forward and\r\nhold Margarita, or if that was impossible, the hill and village of La\r\nHermandad behind it. But only Darmagnac’s division was immediately\r\navailable for this task, Cassagne’s having to be brought back from\r\nthe eccentric counter-march toward the Trevino road, to which it had\r\nbeen committed an hour before. In this way a new line of battle would\r\nbe formed, reaching from the Zadorra near Margarita across the high\r\nroad at Gomecha, to the heights above Zumelzu on the left. It was\r\nat best a hazardous business to order a fighting-line more than two\r\nmiles long, and bitterly engaged with the enemy at several points, to\r\nwithdraw to an unsurveyed position a mile in its rear, where there\r\nwas practically no reserve waiting to receive it. For on the slopes\r\nabove Ariñez there was at that moment nothing but Pierre Soult’s light\r\nhorse, and Treillard’s dragoons, with two batteries of artillery[571].\r\nThe new front had to be constructed from troops falling back in haste\r\nand closely pursued by the enemy, combining with other troops coming\r\nin from various directions, viz. the two divisions of the Army of the\r\nCentre. And when the line should be re-formed, what was to prevent its\r\nleft from being turned once more by the Allied troops on the Puebla\r\nheights, or its right by columns crossing the middle Zadorra behind\r\nit[572]. For there would still be a gap of two miles between Margarita\r\nvillage and the nearest troops of the Army of Portugal, who were now\r\nengaged with Graham at Abechuco and Arriaga.\r\n\r\nTo speak plainly, the second French line was never properly formed,\r\nespecially on its left; but a better front was made, and a stronger\r\nstand, than might perhaps have been expected, though the confusion\r\ncaused by hasty and imperfect alignment was destined in the end to be\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nOn the extreme left Villatte had been caught by the order of recall at\r\nthe moment when he was delivering his attack on Morillo and the British\r\n71st. He had reached the crest as ordered, had formed up across it, and\r\nthen had marched on a narrow front against the Allies. Both British\r\nand Spanish were in some disorder when he came in upon them--they had\r\nnow been fighting for four hours, and in successive engagements had\r\ndriven first Maransin’s and then St. Pol’s brigades for two miles over\r\nvery steep and rocky ground. At the moment when Villatte came upon the\r\nscene, the Allied advance had just reached a broad dip in the crest,\r\nwhich it would have to cross if its progress were to be continued. The\r\nSpaniards were on the right and the 71st and light companies on the\r\nleft, or northern, part of the ridge. It would have been a suitable\r\nmoment to halt, and re-form the line before continuing to press forward\r\nover dangerous ground. But the officer who had succeeded Cadogan\r\nin command[573] was set on ‘keeping the French upon the run,’ and\r\nrecklessly ordered the tired troops to plunge down the steep side of\r\nthe declivity and carry the opposite slope. He was apparently ignorant\r\nthat fresh French troops were just coming to the front--several\r\neye-witnesses say that a column in light-coloured overcoats with white\r\nshako-covers, which had been noticed on the right, was taken for a\r\nSpanish detachment[574]. At any rate, the 71st crossed the dip--four\r\ncompanies in its centre, the remainder at its upper end--and was\r\nsuddenly met not only by a charging column in front, but by an attack\r\nin flank and almost in rear. The first volley brought down 200 men--the\r\nshattered battalion recoiled, and remounted its own slope in utter\r\ndisorder, leaving some forty prisoners in the hands of the enemy. These\r\nwere the only British soldiers who fell into the hands of the French\r\nthat day[575]. Fortunately the 50th, coming up from the rear, was just\r\nin time to form up along the edge of the dip and cover the retreat, and\r\nwas joined soon after by the 92nd, who had been facing another separate\r\nFrench unit lower down the slopes and to the left flank. Seeing their\r\nopponents move off for no visible reason (they had received no doubt\r\nthe general order to retire), the Highland regiment had pushed up on to\r\nthe crest and joined the 50th and the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nVillatte, still ignorant that the whole French army was falling back,\r\ntried to improve his success over the 71st into a general repulse of\r\nthe Allied force upon the crest, and ordered his leading regiment\r\nto cross the dip and attack the troops upon the opposite sky-line.\r\nThey suffered the same fate as the 71st and from the same cause: the\r\nclimb was steep among stones and furze, they were received with two\r\ndevastating volleys when they neared the top of the declivity, and\r\nthen charged by the 50th and 92nd--the column broke, rolled down hill,\r\nand went to the rear. A second but less vigorous attack was made by\r\nanother French regiment, and repulsed with the same ease--the wrecks of\r\nthe 71st joining in the defence this time. Villatte then brought up a\r\nthird regiment, but this was only a feint--the attack never developed,\r\nand while it was hanging fire the whole division swung round to the\r\nrear and went off--Jourdan’s general order to retreat had at last been\r\nreceived, and Villatte was falling back to the new line[576]. Cameron\r\nof the 92nd, now in command on the heights, followed him up, as did the\r\nSpaniards. But there was to be no more serious fighting upon the Puebla\r\nmountain: the French gave way whenever they were pressed[577].\r\n\r\nLong before Villatte’s fight on the high ground had come to an\r\nend, the engagement at the other end of the French line had taken\r\nan unfavourable turn. The battle in this direction fell into three\r\nseparate sections. Close to the Zadorra, Colville, with the left-hand\r\nbrigade of the 3rd Division, was pushing up towards Margarita, while\r\nDarmagnac, from the heights of Zuazo, was making for it from the other\r\nside. It had taken some time to file Colville’s battalions across\r\nthe ford, and deploy them for the advance, and the French brigade of\r\nDarmagnac’s division got into the village first, and made a strong\r\ndefence there, while the German brigade occupied La Hermandad in\r\nits rear. Colville was held in check, suffered heavily, and could\r\nnot get forward. But after half an hour’s deadly fighting the enemy\r\ngave way, not only because of the frontal pressure, but because the\r\ntroops on his left (Leval’s division of the Army of the South) had\r\nbeen defeated by Picton and were retiring, thereby exposing the flank\r\nof Darmagnac’s line. D’Erlon drew back Chassé’s much thinned brigade\r\nhalf a mile, to the better defensive ground formed by the village of\r\nLa Hermandad and the height above it, where his German brigade was\r\nalready in position: this was an integral part of the new line on which\r\nJourdan had determined to fight, while Margarita was on low ground, and\r\ntoo far to the front. Colville’s brigade, like its adversaries much\r\nmaltreated[578], was replaced by Grant’s brigade of the 7th Division\r\nin front line[579], while Vandeleur’s of the Light Division followed\r\nin support. They had now in front of them not only Darmagnac’s but\r\nCassagne’s division, which had come back from its fruitless excursion\r\nto the Trevino road, and had joined the other section of the Army of\r\nthe Centre[580], taking up ground in second line.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the really decisive blow of the whole battle was being\r\ndelivered by Picton, a thousand yards farther to the south, in and\r\nabove Ariñez. The striking force here consisted of Power’s Portuguese\r\nbrigade on the left, and of Brisbane’s British brigade on the right,\r\nopposite the village. Kempt’s half of the Light Division had followed\r\nPicton faithfully in his diagonal movement across the slopes, and was\r\nclose behind Brisbane. Farther to the right the new front of attack of\r\nWellington’s army was only beginning to form itself--the 4th Division\r\nhad deployed after crossing the upper bridge of Nanclares, and was\r\nnow coming on in an échelon of brigades--Stubbs’s Portuguese in the\r\nfront échelon, then W. Anson, last Skerrett. They extended from the\r\nhigh road southwards, and were getting into touch with Hill’s column,\r\nwhich after the French evacuated the height behind Subijana had also\r\ndeployed for the advance--the 2nd division having now thrown forward\r\nByng’s brigade on its left, with O’Callaghan’s next it, and Ashworth’s\r\nPortuguese in second line. Silveira’s division remained in reserve. The\r\ncavalry of the centre column had crossed after the infantry--R. Hill,\r\nPonsonby, Victor Alten, and Grant by the upper bridge of Nanclares,\r\nD’Urban’s Portuguese by the lower. They deployed on each side of the\r\nhigh road east of the river, behind the 4th Division, ground suitable\r\nfor horsemen being nowhere else visible. On the heights of Puebla there\r\nstill remained Cadogan’s brigade (now under Cameron of the 92nd) and\r\nMorillo’s Spaniards. This detached force, which was hard in pursuit of\r\nVillatte’s retreating column, was decidedly ahead of the rest of the\r\narmy, and well placed for striking at the new French flank, but it was\r\ntired and had fought hard already for many hours.\r\n\r\nWhen the 4th Division had passed the upper bridge of Nanclares, and\r\nbefore the cavalry began to cross the Zadorra, Colonel Dickson had by\r\nWellington’s orders commenced to bring forward the reserve artillery.\r\nVery few British batteries had yet come into action, the broken nature\r\nof the ground preventing them from keeping close to their divisions.\r\nHence it came to pass that there was by this time an accumulation of\r\nguns in the centre: during the rest of the battle it was employed in\r\nmass, many divisional batteries joining the artillery reserve, and a\r\nformidable line of guns being presently developed along the heights\r\nwhich had been the original position of Gazan’s centre and right. Some\r\nof them were to the north of the high road, on Leval’s hill: some to\r\nthe south, where Daricau’s front brigade had stood when the action\r\ncommenced. As soon as they had come up, they began to pound the French\r\ninfantry on the opposite hill. Here General Tirlet had a still more\r\npowerful artillery force in action--all the guns of the front line had\r\ngot back in safety save one belonging to the horse artillery battery\r\nwhich had been placed opposite the bridge of Nanclares[581], and three\r\nbatteries from the reserve were already in position. The cannonade on\r\nboth sides was fierce--but it was the infantry which had to settle\r\nthe matter, and the disadvantage to the French was that their troops,\r\nmuch hustled and disarranged while retreating into the new position,\r\nnever properly settled down into it--especially Conroux’s and Daricau’s\r\ndivisions, which had been divided into separate brigades by the way\r\nin which Gazan had dealt with them at the commencement of the action,\r\nnever got into regular divisional order again, and fought piecemeal by\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nThe decisive point was on the ground at and above Ariñez, which was\r\nheld by Leval’s division, with one regiment of Daricau’s (103rd\r\nLine) on their left. The village, low down on the slope, was held by\r\nMocquery’s brigade--Morgan’s was in support with the guns, higher up\r\nand more to the right. Picton attacked with Power’s Portuguese on his\r\nleft, Brisbane’s brigade on his right, and Kempt’s brigade of the Light\r\nDivision in support, except that some companies of the 1/95th had been\r\nthrown out in front of Brisbane’s line, and led the whole attack. The\r\nRiflemen rushed at the village, penetrated into it, and were evicted\r\nafter a fierce tussle, by a French battalion charging in mass down the\r\nstreet. But immediately behind came the 88th and 74th. The former,\r\nattacking to their right of the village[582], completely smashed the\r\nFrench regiment which came down to meet them in a close-fire combat,\r\nand drove them in disorder up the hill, while the latter carried Ariñez\r\nitself and swept onward through it. The 45th, farther to the right,\r\nattacked and drove off the regiment of Daricau’s division which was\r\nflanking Leval. Power’s Portuguese would seem to have got engaged with\r\nMorgan’s brigade, on the left of the village; it gave way before them,\r\nwhen the 74th had stormed Ariñez and the Connaught Rangers had broken\r\nthe neighbouring column. Leval’s routed troops appear to have swept\r\nto the rear rather in a southerly direction, and to their left of the\r\nhigh road, so as to leave the beginnings of a gap between them and\r\nCassagne’s division of the Army of the Centre, which was coming up to\r\noccupy the ridge north of Gomecha, in the new position.\r\n\r\nThe complete breach in the French centre made by Picton’s capture of\r\nAriñez, and the driving of Leval out of his position above it, had the\r\nimmediate effect of compelling Darmagnac’s division to conform to the\r\nretreat, by falling back from Margarita on to La Hermandad and the\r\nhills behind it on the one wing, while the confused line of Daricau’s,\r\nConroux’s, and Maransin’s troops, on the other hand, had to retire to\r\nthe level of Gomecha, though the 4th and 2nd Divisions were not yet far\r\nenough forward to be able to press them. Nearly all the French guns\r\nappear to have been carried back to the new position, which may roughly\r\nbe described as extending from Hermandad on the Zadorra by Zuazo and\r\nGomecha to the hills in front of Esquivel. It was quite as good as the\r\nMargarita-Ariñez-Zumelzu line which had just been forced by Picton’s\r\ncentral attack.\r\n\r\nIt took some little time for Wellington to organize his next advance;\r\nthe troops which had forced the Ariñez position had to be re-formed,\r\nand it was necessary to allow the 4th and 2nd Divisions to come up\r\nlevel with them, and to bring forward Dickson’s mass of artillery to\r\na more advanced line, to batter the enemy before the next infantry\r\nassault was let loose. The only point where close fighting seems to\r\nhave continued during this interval was on the extreme left, where\r\nLord Dalhousie, after the French had left Margarita, was pressing\r\nforward Grant’s brigade of his own division, supported by Vandeleur’s\r\nbrigade of the Light Division, against D’Erlon’s new position, where\r\nNeuenstein’s brigade of five German battalions lay in and about La\r\nHermandad, with Chassé’s dilapidated regiments in reserve behind.\r\nThere was a very bitter struggle at this point, rendered costly to the\r\nadvancing British by the superiority of the French artillery--D’Erlon\r\nhad now at least two batteries in action--Dalhousie only his own six\r\ndivisional guns, those of Cairnes. Grant’s brigade, after advancing\r\nsome 300 yards under a very heavy fire, came to a stand, and took cover\r\nin a deep broad ditch only 200 yards from the French front. According\r\nto an eye-witness Dalhousie hesitated for a moment as to whether a\r\nfurther advance was possible[583], and had the matter settled for\r\nhim by the sudden charge of Vandeleur’s brigade, which came up at\r\nfull speed, carried the 7th Division battalions in the ditch along\r\nwith it in its impetus, and stormed La Hermandad in ten minutes. The\r\nGerman defenders--Baden, Nassau, and Frankfurt battalions--reeled back\r\nin disorder, and retreated to the crest of the heights behind, where\r\nCassagne’s division, hitherto not engaged, picked them up. D’Erlon\r\nsucceeded in forming some sort of a new line from Crispijana near\r\nthe Zadorra to Zuazo, where his left should have joined the right\r\nof the Army of the South. It is curious to note that while Grant’s\r\nbrigade lost heavily in this combat (330 casualties), Vandeleur’s,\r\nwhich carried on the attack to success, suffered hardly at all (38\r\ncasualties). Their German opponents were very badly punished, having\r\nlost 620 men, including 250 prisoners, in defending La Hermandad\r\nagainst the two British brigades[584].\r\n\r\nWhile Wellington, after the first breaking of the French line, was\r\npreparing under cover of the cannonade of Dickson’s guns for the\r\nassault on their new position in front of Zuazo and Gomecha, General\r\nGraham was developing his attack on the Army of Portugal and the French\r\nline of retreat, but not with the energy that might have been expected\r\nfrom the victor of Barrosa.\r\n\r\nHe had, as it will be remembered, sent Oswald and the 5th Division\r\nagainst the bridge of Gamarra Mayor, and Longa’s Spaniards against that\r\nof Durana, while he himself remained with the 1st Division, Pack’s and\r\nBradford’s Portuguese, and the bulk of his cavalry on the high road,\r\nfacing the bridge of Arriaga and its outlying bulwark the village\r\nof Abechuco. We should have expected that the main attack would be\r\ndelivered at this point, but nothing of the sort took place. When the\r\nnoise of Oswald’s heavy fighting at Gamarra Mayor had begun to grow\r\nloud, Graham directed the two Light Battalions of the German Legion\r\n(under Colonel Halkett) to clear the French out of Abechuco. This they\r\ndid with trifling loss--1 officer and 51 men, capturing several guns\r\nin the village[585]. But Graham made no subsequent attempt to improve\r\nhis success by forcing the bridge behind--as is sufficiently witnessed\r\nby the fact that of his remaining battalions the Guards’ Brigade had\r\nno casualties that day, and the three Line battalions of the K.G.L.\r\none killed and one wounded. Before drawing up in front of Arriaga he\r\nhad sent Bradford’s Portuguese, for a short time, to demonstrate to\r\nhis right, toward the bridge of Yurre; but he called them back after a\r\nspace, and placed them to the right of Abechuco, continuing the general\r\nline of the First Division. Bradford’s battalions lost precisely 4\r\nmen killed and 9 wounded. It is clear, therefore, that Graham never\r\nattacked the Arriaga position at all. Why he massed 4,000 British and\r\n4,000 Portuguese infantry on this front--not to speak of two brigades\r\nof cavalry--and then never used them, it is hard to make out.\r\n\r\nWe know, it is true, that not only Graham but Wellington himself\r\nover-estimated the strength of Reille’s force. They did not know that\r\nMaucune had gone away in the dark, in charge of the great convoy, and\r\nthought that Foy’s and Taupin’s divisions were the only troops of the\r\nArmy of Portugal which had not rejoined. Arguing that he had four\r\ninfantry divisions in front of him (though they were really only two),\r\nGraham no doubt did well to be cautious--but he was much more than\r\nthat. It was at least his duty to detain and engage as many of the\r\nenemy’s troops as was possible--and he certainly did not do so.\r\n\r\nThere was opposite him at Arriaga one single infantry\r\ndivision--Sarrut’s, and he did so little to employ it that Reille\r\ndared--after observing the British movements for some time--to take\r\naway Sarrut’s second brigade (that of Fririon) for use as a central\r\nreserve, which he posted at Betonio a mile back from the river, leaving\r\nMenne’s brigade alone--not much over 2,000 bayonets--opposed to the\r\nwhole 1st Division, Bradford, and Pack. It is true that Menne had heavy\r\ncavalry supports--Digeon’s dragoons and Curto’s brigade of Mermet’s\r\nlight horse--on one flank, and Boyer’s dragoons not far away on the\r\nother. But cavalry in 1813 were not troops which could defend a bridge\r\nor the line of a river. There was also a good deal of French artillery\r\npresent--a more important fact under the existing circumstances. For\r\nReille had still twenty guns ranged along the river[586], beside those\r\nwhich were detached on the flank with Casapalacios’ Spaniards. But\r\nGraham had almost as many--the three batteries of Lawson, Ramsay, and\r\nDubourdieu--and of these the two last, ranged opposite Arriaga bridge,\r\nand pounding the village behind it, quite held their own against the\r\nopposing guns.\r\n\r\nIt can only be supposed that Graham, in refraining from any serious\r\nattack along the high road, was obeying in too literal a fashion\r\nWellington’s orders not to commit himself to close fighting in the\r\nlow ground, and to regulate his movements by those of the columns on\r\nhis right (Picton’s and Dalhousie’s divisions). When these had worked\r\ntheir way up the Zadorra to his neighbourhood he _did_ advance. But it\r\nwas then so late that the enemy in front of him was able to get away,\r\nwithout any very disastrous losses.\r\n\r\nWhile Graham kept quiet on the high road, Oswald was engaged in a very\r\ndifferent style at Gamarra Mayor, where after his first capture of the\r\nvillage, he made at least three desperate attempts to force the bridge,\r\nheld most obstinately by Lamartinière’s division. The passage was taken\r\nand retaken, but no lodgement on the southern bank could be made. After\r\nRobinson’s brigade had exhausted itself, Oswald put in the 3/1st from\r\nHay’s brigade and some of his Portuguese[587]. But no success was\r\nobtained, though both sides suffered heavily. The casualty rolls of the\r\n5th Division show a loss of 38 officers and 515 men--those of their\r\nFrench opponents 38 officers and 558 men. Practically all on both sides\r\nfell in the murderous fighting up and down Gamarra bridge. The forces\r\nwere so equally balanced--each about 6,000 bayonets and one divisional\r\nbattery--that on such a narrow front decision was impossible when both\r\nfought their best. The only way of attacking the bridge was by pushing\r\nstraight down the narrow street of the village from the British side,\r\nand across an open field from the French. Both parties had guns trained\r\nupon its ends, which blew to pieces any column-head that debouched.\r\nThere were no fords anywhere near, and the banks for some distance\r\nup-stream and down-stream were lined by the skirmishers of both sides,\r\ntaking what cover they could find, and doing their best to keep down\r\neach other’s fire. ‘It plainly appeared this day that the enemy had\r\nformed a sort of determination not to be beat: we never saw them stand\r\nso vigorous before,’ writes a diarist from the ranks, in Robinson’s\r\nbrigade[588].\r\n\r\nThere was an absolute deadlock at Gamarra Mayor till nearly\r\nfive o’clock in the afternoon. At Durana things went otherwise:\r\nLonga, though hampered by his lack of guns, ended by pushing the\r\nFranco-Spanish brigade across the bridge, and then for some way down\r\nthe south side of the Zadorra. The retreating party then made a stand\r\nbehind a ravine and brook some half-mile farther on, where they were\r\nflanked by a brigade of Mermet’s light cavalry, as well as by their own\r\nfive squadrons, and supported by the French battalion of the 3rd Line\r\nwhich had been in their quarter of the field from the first. Longa was\r\nunable to push them farther--probably for fear of lending his flank to\r\ncavalry charges, and gained no further ground till the general retreat\r\nof the French army began. But he had effectively cut King Joseph’s\r\ncommunication with France by seizing Durana--and this was the governing\r\nfactor of the whole fight, since the enemy had now only the Pampeluna\r\nroad by which he could retreat. If Joseph had owned some infantry\r\nreserves, he could (no doubt) have driven Longa away; but he had not a\r\nman to spare in any part of the field, and things were going so badly\r\nwith the Army of the South that he had no attention to spare for the\r\nArmy of Portugal.\r\n\r\nIt must have been about four o’clock before Wellington, having\r\nrearranged his line and brought up his artillery, determined to renew\r\nthe general attack on the French right and centre. Joseph had brought\r\nup to the new position (extending from Crispijana on the left by Zuazo\r\nto the heights in front of Esquivel) the whole of the infantry of the\r\nArmies of the South and Centre, which now formed one rather irregular\r\nline. The only infantry reserve was the six weak battalions of the\r\nRoyal Guard--perhaps 2,500 bayonets[589], placed on the high road in\r\nfront of Vittoria--there was also a mass of cavalry in reserve, but\r\nthis was of as little use for the defence of a hill-position as was\r\nWellington’s for the assault on it. There were now in line Tilly’s\r\ndivision of dragoons which had been brought back from its useless\r\nexcursion on the Logroño road, and Pierre Soult’s light horse, both\r\nof Gazan’s army, with Treillard’s dragoons, Avy’s Chasseurs, and the\r\ntwo cavalry regiments of the Royal Guard, all from the Army of the\r\nCentre--in all some 4,500 sabres.\r\n\r\nThe artillery, however, was very strong, and--deployed in a long line\r\non both sides of the high road--was already sweeping all the slopes\r\nin front. There were present 46 guns of the Army of the South (all\r\nthat it owned save one piece lost at Ariñez and three absent with\r\nDigeon’s dragoons), twelve guns of the Army of the Centre, and 18\r\nfrom the reserve of the Army of Portugal--76 in all[590]. Dickson\r\nwould appear to have brought up against them very nearly the same\r\nnumber: 54 British, 18 Portuguese, and 3 Spanish guns, when the last\r\nof the reserve batteries had got across the Zadorra and come forward\r\ninto line--a total of 75 pieces[591]. The cannonade was the fiercest\r\never known in the Peninsula--each side was mainly trying to pound\r\nthe enemy’s infantry--a task more easy for the French than the Allied\r\ngunners, since the assailant had to come up the open hillside, and the\r\nassailed was partly screened by woods (especially in front of Gomecha)\r\nand dips in the rough ground which he was holding.\r\n\r\nThe French line was now formed by Cassagne’s division on the extreme\r\nright, with one regiment (the 16th Léger) in Crispijana, and the others\r\nextending to meet Darmagnac’s much depleted battalions which were in\r\nand about Zuazo. Leval ought to have been in touch with Darmagnac, but\r\nobviously was not, the ground on each side of the high road being held\r\nby guns only, with cavalry in support some way behind. For after losing\r\nAriñez Leval’s infantry had inclined much to their left. But on the\r\nother flank Villatte had, as it seems, inclined somewhat to the right,\r\nfor having lost the heights of La Puebla, he could not prevent Cameron\r\nand Morillo from pressing along their crest and getting behind his new\r\nposition: they were edging past his flank all through this period of\r\nthe action.\r\n\r\nThe long front of the British advance started with Colville’s\r\nbrigade--now once more in front line--opposite Crispijana, and was\r\ncontinued southward by those of Grant, Power, Brisbane, Stubbs, Byng,\r\nand O’Callaghan, while Vandeleur, Kempt, W. Anson, Skerrett, and\r\nAshworth were formed in support, with Silveira’s division and the\r\ncavalry in third line. The missing brigades of the 7th Division were\r\nnot yet on the field, possibly not even across the Zadorra, for neither\r\nof them lost a man that day. The advance of the line was a splendid\r\nspectacle, recorded with notes of admiration by many who witnessed it\r\nfrom the hill of Ariñez or the heights of La Puebla.\r\n\r\nThe French artillery fire was heavy, and in some sections of the line\r\nvery murderous--Power’s and Stubbs’s Portuguese brigades were special\r\nsufferers. But the infantry defence was not resolute: on many parts of\r\nthe front it was obviously very weak. The enemy was already a beaten\r\narmy, he had been turned out of two positions, the news had got round\r\nthat the road to France had been cut, and that Reille’s small force\r\nwas in grave danger of losing the line of the Zadorra--in which case\r\nthe whole army would find itself attacked in the rear. It is clear\r\nfrom the French narratives that the infantry did not support the guns\r\nin front line as they should. The reports of the Army of the Centre\r\nspeak of being turned on their right by a column which kept near the\r\nriver and took Crispijana--obviously Colville’s brigade. As the 16th\r\nLéger in that village only suffered a loss that day of one officer and\r\n26 men, its resistance cannot have been very serious. But D’Erlon’s\r\ndivisions were also outflanked on their left--by clouds of skirmishers\r\ndrifting in by the wood and broken ground about Gomecha, who turned\r\non the line of artillery, and began shooting down the gunners from\r\nflank and rear[592]. Obviously there was a gap along the high road,\r\nby which these light troops must have penetrated, and as obviously it\r\nwas caused by Leval having sheered off to the south. For the artillery\r\nreport of Gazan’s army also speaks of being turned on its right\r\nwing--‘enveloped by skirmishers who had got into Gomecha and were in\r\nrear of the position, which was being also attacked frontally.’ Nor is\r\nthis all, ‘the mass on the mountain (Cameron and Morillo) descended on\r\nthe left flank and rear of the Army of the South before it had time to\r\nform again: the artillery found itself without support.’ If so, where\r\nwere the four and a half divisions of infantry which should have been\r\nprotecting it?\r\n\r\nThe only possible deduction from all our narratives is that Gazan’s\r\narmy made no real stand on the Gomecha-Esquivel position, and retired\r\nthe moment that the attack drew near. And the person mainly responsible\r\nfor the retreat was the Army-Commander himself, whose very unconvincing\r\naccount of this phase of the action is that ‘the right flank of the\r\nline was continually being outflanked: I received no further orders\r\nabout the taking up of the position of which the King had spoken;\r\nthe enemy was getting near the gates of Vittoria (!), and so I had\r\nto continue my movement toward that town, after having taken up a\r\nposition by Zuazo, with the intention of covering with my right-hand\r\ndivision and my guns the retreat of the rest of the army, which without\r\nthis help would have been hopelessly compromised. At this time I had\r\nonly lost four guns, abandoned on the extreme left of the line: the\r\nartillery was intact, and the army had suffered no greater loss than it\r\nhad inflicted on the enemy.’\r\n\r\nReading this artful narrative, we note that (1) Gazan evacuated on his\r\nown responsibility a position that the King had definitely ordered\r\nhim to take up--because he had ‘no further orders’; (2) the continued\r\n‘turning of his right’ could only have resulted from the defeat of his\r\nown troops on and about the high road--which was in his sector, not\r\nin D’Erlon’s, Leval was across it when the last phase of the battle\r\nbegan; (3) D’Erlon held Zuazo and complained that there was nothing on\r\nhis left, which was completely turned on the side where Leval _ought_\r\nto have been but was not; (4) Gazan retreated without any serious loss\r\nhaving compelled him to do so. This is obviously the fact. Villatte’s\r\nwhole division had less than 300 casualties, Leval’s under 800,\r\nDaricau’s under 850: the only troops hard hit were Maransin’s brigade,\r\nRey’s brigade of Conroux’s division, and the 103rd Line in Daricau’s.\r\nMoreover, the 4th and 2nd British Divisions, the troops immediately\r\nopposed to Gazan’s main line, had insignificant losses in this part\r\nof the action, Byng’s brigade under 150, Ashworth’s just 23, Anson’s\r\n90, Skerrett’s 22; the only appreciable loss had been that of Stubbs’s\r\nPortuguese--about 240. For the heavy casualty lists of O’Callaghan’s,\r\nCadogan’s, and Brisbane’s battalions had all been suffered in the\r\nearlier phases of the fight[593].\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Gazan went off without orders, and left the King\r\nand D’Erlon in the lurch. Jourdan is telling the exact truth when he\r\nsays that ‘General Gazan, instead of conducting his divisions to the\r\nposition indicated, swerved strongly to the right, marching in retreat,\r\nso as to link up with Villatte; he continued to draw away, following\r\nthe foot-hills of the mountain [of Puebla], leaving the high road and\r\nVittoria far to his left, and a vast gap between himself and Count\r\nD’Erlon’[594].\r\n\r\nNo doubt the breach made in the French centre when Picton stormed the\r\nheights behind Ariñez had been irreparable from the first; and no doubt\r\nalso the flanking movement of Morillo and Cameron on the mountain must\r\nhave dislodged the Army of the South, if it had waited to come into\r\nfrontal action with Cole and Hill. But Gazan showed complete disregard\r\nof all interests save his own, and went off in comparatively good\r\ncondition, without orders, leaving the King, D’Erlon, and Reille to get\r\nout of the mess as best they might.\r\n\r\nSome of the British narratives tend to show that many parts of Gazan’s\r\nline had never properly settled down into the Gomecha-Esquivel\r\nposition, having reached it in such bad order that they would have\r\nrequired more time than was granted them to re-form. An officer\r\npresent with the skirmishing line of the 4th Division writes in his\r\nabsolutely contemporary diary: ‘From the time when our guns began to\r\nopen, and to throw shells almost into the rear of the enemy’s height,\r\nwe saw him begin to fall back in haste from his position. We [4th\r\nDivision] marched on at a great pace in column. From that moment the\r\naffair became a mere hunt. Our rapid advance almost cut off four\r\nor five French battalions--they made some resistance at first, but\r\nsoon dissolved and ran pell-mell, like a swarm of bees, up the steep\r\nhill, from which they began to fire down on us. We disregarded their\r\nfire, and kept on advancing--in order to carry out our main object:\r\nbroken troops are easy game. When we found the enemy in this second\r\nposition there was heavy artillery fire. Since his left wing was\r\nsomewhat refused, we advanced in échelon from the right. When we got\r\nwithin musketry range, we found he had gone off out of sight. After\r\nthat we drove him out of one position after another till at last we\r\nwere near the gates of Vittoria[595].’ Several other 4th Division\r\nand 2nd Division narratives agree in stating that after the storming\r\nof Ariñez the French never made anything like a solid stand on the\r\nGomecha-Esquivel heights. But (as has been said above) the best proof\r\nof it is the British casualty list, which shows that the reserve line\r\nwas hardly under fire, and that the front line had very moderate\r\nlosses, except at one or two points.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon made a more creditable resistance on the French right, but he\r\nwas obviously doomed if he should linger long after Gazan had gone\r\noff. After losing Crispijana and Zuazo he made a last stand on the\r\nslopes a mile in front of Vittoria, between Ali and Armentia, to which\r\nthe whole of his own artillery and that of the reserve, and perhaps\r\nalso some guns of the Army of the South, retired in time to take up a\r\nfinal position[596]. For some short space they maintained a furious\r\nfire on the 3rd Division troops which were following them up, so as to\r\nallow their infantry to re-form. But it was but for a few minutes--the\r\ncolumn near the Zadorra (Grant, Colville, and Vandeleur) got round\r\nthe flank of the village of Ali, and the line of guns was obviously\r\nin danger if it remained any longer in action. Just at this moment\r\nD’Erlon received the King’s orders for a general retreat by the route\r\nof Salvatierra. The high road to France had ceased to be available\r\nsince Longa got across it in the earlier afternoon. Any attempt to\r\nforce it open would obviously have taken much time, and might well\r\nhave failed, since the French were everywhere closely pressed by the\r\npursuing British. Jourdan judged the idea of reopening the passage to\r\nbe hopelessly impracticable, and ordered the retreat on Pampeluna as\r\nthe only possible policy, though (as his report owns) he was aware of\r\nthe badness of the Salvatierra road, and doubted his power to carry\r\noff his guns, transport, and convoy of refugees by such a second-rate\r\ntrack. But it was the only one open, and there was no choice.\r\n\r\nThe orders issued were that the Train and Park should get off at\r\nonce, that the Army of the South should retreat by the country paths\r\nsouth of Vittoria, the Army of the Centre by those north of it. The\r\nArmy of Portugal was to hang on to its position till D’Erlon’s troops\r\nhad passed its rear, and then follow them as best it could. All the\r\ncross-tracks indicated to the three armies ended by converging on the\r\nSalvatierra road east of Vittoria, so that a hopeless confusion was\r\nassured for the moment when three separate streams of retreating troops\r\nshould meet, and struggle for the use of one narrow and inadequate\r\nthoroughfare. But as a matter of fact the chaos began long before that\r\ntime was reached, for the road was blocked or ever the three armies\r\ngot near it. The order for the retreat of the Park and convoys had\r\nbeen issued far too late--Gazan says that he had advised Jourdan to\r\ngive it two hours before, when the first positions had been abandoned.\r\nBut the Marshal had apparently high confidence in his power to hold\r\nthe Hermandad-Gomecha-Esquivel line; at any rate, he had given no\r\nsuch command. The noise of battle rolling ever closer to Vittoria\r\nhad warned the mixed multitude of civil and military hangers-on of\r\nthe army who were waiting by their carriages, carts, pack-mules,\r\nand fourgons, in the open fields east of Vittoria, that the French\r\narmy was being driven in. Many of those who were not under military\r\ndiscipline had begun to push ahead on the Salvatierra road, the moment\r\nthat the alarming news flew around that the great _chaussée_ leading\r\nto France had been blocked. The Park, however--which all day long\r\nhad been sending up reserve ammunition to the front, and even one or\r\ntwo improvised sections of guns--had naturally remained waiting for\r\norders. So had the immense accumulation of divisional and regimental\r\nbaggage, the convoy of treasure which had arrived from Bayonne on the\r\n19th, and the heavy carriages of the King’s personal caravan, stuffed\r\nwith the plate and pictures of the palace at Madrid. And of the\r\nmiscellaneous French and Spanish hangers-on of the Court--ministers,\r\ncourtiers, clerks, commissaries, contractors, and the ladies who in\r\nlegitimate or illegitimate capacities followed them--few had dared to\r\ngo off unescorted on an early start. There was a vast accumulation\r\nof distracted womenfolk--_nous étions un bordel ambulant_, said one\r\nFrench eye-witness--some crammed together in travelling coaches with\r\nchildren and servants, others riding the spare horses or mules of the\r\nmen to whom they belonged. When the orders for general retreat were\r\nshouted around, among the fields where the multitude had been waiting,\r\nthree thousand vehicles of one sort and another tried simultaneously\r\nto get into one or another of the five field-paths which go east from\r\nVittoria, all of which ultimately debouch into the single narrow\r\nSalvatierra road. A dozen blocks and upsets had occurred before the\r\nfirst ten minutes were over, and chaos supervened. Many carriages\r\nand waggons never got off on a road at all. Into the rear of this\r\nconfusion there came charging, a few minutes later, batteries of\r\nartillery going at high speed, and strings of caissons, which had been\r\nhorsed up and had started away early from the Park. Of course they\r\ncould not get through--but the thrust which they delivered, before\r\nthey came to an enforced stop, jammed the crowd of vehicles in front\r\nof them into a still more hopeless block. Dozens of carriages broke\r\ndown--whereupon light-fingered fugitives began to help themselves\r\nto all that was spilt. Of course camp followers began the game, but\r\nJourdan says that a large proportion of the French prisoners that day\r\nwere soldiers who _s’amusaient à piller_ in and about Vittoria; one\r\nof the official reports from the Army of Portugal remarks that the\r\nretreating cavalry joined in the ‘general pillage of the valuables\r\nof the army,’ and other narrators mention that the treasure-fourgons\r\nhad already been broken into long before the English came upon the\r\nscene[597]. Be this as it may, there was no long delay before the\r\nterrors of the stampede culminated with the arrival of several\r\nsquadrons of Grant’s hussars, who had penetrated by the gap between\r\nD’Erlon’s and Gazan’s lines of retreat, and had made a short cut\r\nthrough the suburbs of the town. Of the chaos that followed the firing\r\nof the first pistol shots which heralded the charge of the British\r\nlight cavalry, we must not speak till we have dealt with the last fight\r\nof the Army of Portugal, on the extreme French right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle of VITTORIA]\r\n\r\nTill Grant’s and Colville’s brigades broke into Crispijana and Ali, the\r\nline of Reille’s gallant defence along the Zadorra had remained intact.\r\nOnly artillery fire was going on opposite the bridge of Arriaga,\r\nwhere the 1st Division and the two Portuguese brigades had halted\r\nby Graham’s orders at some distance from the river, and had never\r\nadvanced. The two cavalry brigades were behind them. At Gamarra Mayor\r\nthe 5th Division had failed to force a passage, though it had inflicted\r\non Lamartinière’s troops as heavy a loss as it suffered. Longa was\r\nheld up half a mile beyond Durana, though he had successfully cut the\r\nBayonne _chaussée_. There was considerable cannonade and skirmishing\r\nfire going on, upon a front of three miles, but no further progress\r\nreported. The whole scene, however, was changed from the moment when\r\nGrant’s and Colville’s brigades, turning the flank of D’Erlon’s line\r\nclose to the Zadorra, came sweeping over the hills by Ali into the\r\nvery rear of Reille’s line. The Army of Portugal had been directed to\r\nhold the bridges and keep back Graham, until the rest of the French\r\nhost had got off. But the danger now came not from the front but from\r\nthe rear. In half an hour more the advancing British columns would be\r\nlevel with the bridge of Arriaga and surrounding the infantry that held\r\nit. Reille determined on instant retreat, the only course open to him:\r\nso far as was possible it was covered by the very ample provision of\r\ncavalry which he had in hand. Digeon, who has left a good account of\r\nthe crisis, made several desperate charges, to hold back the advancing\r\nBritish while Menne’s brigade was escaping from Arriaga. One was\r\nagainst infantry, which formed square and beat off the dragoons with no\r\ndifficulty[598]--the other against hussars, apparently two squadrons of\r\nthe 15th, which had turned northward from the suburbs of Vittoria and\r\ntried to ride in and cut off the retreat of Menne’s battalions[599].\r\nThey were beaten back, and the infantry scrambled off, leaving behind\r\nthem Sarrut, their divisional general, mortally wounded as the retreat\r\nbegan. Moreover, all the guns in and about Arriaga had to be abandoned\r\nin the fields, where they could make no rapid progress. The gunners\r\nunhitched the horses, and escaped as best they could.\r\n\r\nReille had drawn up in front of Betonio the small infantry reserve\r\n(Fririon’s brigade) which he had wisely provided for himself,\r\nflanked by Boyer’s dragoons and Curto’s brigade of light cavalry.\r\nThe object of this stand was not only to give Menne’s and Digeon’s\r\ntroops a nucleus on which they could rally, but to gain time for\r\nLamartinière to draw off from in front of Gamarra Mayor bridge, where\r\nhe was still hotly engaged with Oswald’s division. This infantry got\r\naway in better order than most French troops on that day, and even\r\nbrought off its divisional battery, though that of the cavalry which\r\nhad been co-operating with it had to be left behind not far from the\r\nriver-bank, having got into a marshy bottom where it stuck fast. The\r\nFranco-Spaniards of Casapalacios and their attendant cavalry escaped\r\nover the hills east of Durana, pursued by Longa, who took many\r\nprisoners from them.\r\n\r\nWhen Lamartinière’s division had come in, Reille made a rapid retreat\r\nto the woods of Zurbano, a mile and a half behind Betonio, which\r\npromised good cover. He was now being pursued by the whole of Graham’s\r\ncorps, which had crossed the Zadorra when the bridges were abandoned.\r\nPack’s brigade, followed by the 1st Division and Bradford, advanced on\r\nArriaga; they were somewhat late owing to slow filing over the bridge.\r\nAt Gamarra Oswald sent in the pursuit of Lamartinière two squadrons of\r\nlight dragoons[600] which had been attached to his column; these were\r\nfollowed by the rest of their brigade, which Graham sent up from the\r\nmain road to join them, and also by Bock’s German dragoons. The object\r\nof using the smaller and more remote bridge was that cavalry crossing\r\nby it had a better chance of getting into Reille’s rear than they would\r\nhave secured by passing at Arriaga. The much exhausted 5th Division\r\nfollowed the cavalry.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the edge of the woods, Reille ordered the bulk of his\r\ntroops to push on hard, by the two parallel roads which traverse\r\nthem, keeping Fririon’s brigade in hand as a fighting rearguard. The\r\nrather disordered columns were emerging on the east side of the woods,\r\nand streaming into and past the village of Zurbano, when the leading\r\nsquadrons of the 12th and 16th Light Dragoons came in upon them.\r\nThese squadrons had avoided entangling themselves in the trees till\r\nthe French rearguard had passed on, but prepared to charge the moment\r\nthey got into open ground, though the main body of the brigade had not\r\ncome up. They found opposed to them a regiment of Boyer’s dragoons,\r\nsupported by another of hussars, which they charged but did not\r\nbreak[601]. But on the coming up of the rear squadrons, the attack was\r\nrenewed with success. The French cavalry gave way, but only to clear\r\nthe front of the 36th Line of Fririon’s brigade, which was in square\r\noutside Zurbano. The British light dragoons swept down on the square,\r\nbut were completely repulsed by its steady fire. This gained time for\r\nthe rest of Reille’s troops to make off, and the pursuit slackened.\r\nBut the bulk of the French went off in such haste that they abandoned\r\nfour guns of Lamartinière’s artillery, and took away with them only the\r\nremaining two--the sole pieces that escaped that day of the immense\r\ntrain of Joseph’s three armies. Some hundreds of stragglers were taken,\r\nbut no single unit of the retiring force was cut off or captured whole.\r\nReille wisely kept his army, so long as was possible, on the side-paths\r\nby Arbulo and Oreytia, before debouching into the main Salvatierra\r\nroad, which was seething over with the wrecks of the other armies and\r\nthe convoys. Hence he succeeded in escaping the utter confusion into\r\nwhich the rest fell, and, finally, when he turned into the main track,\r\nwas able to constitute himself a rearguard to the whole. Graham’s\r\npursuit of him seems to have been slow and cautious--no troops indeed\r\never came near the retreating columns except the two light dragoon\r\nregiments, the Caçador battalions of Pack and Bradford, and some of\r\nLonga’s skirmishers, who (as Reille mentions) followed him along the\r\nhills on his left, shooting down into the retreating masses, but not\r\nattempting to break in. The 5th Division appears to have followed not\r\nmuch farther than the open ground beyond the woods of Zurbano, where it\r\nhalted and encamped after eight o’clock in some bean-fields. Nor does\r\nit seem that the 1st Division got more than a league or so beyond the\r\nZadorra[602]. The Caçadores and cavalry, however, did not halt till\r\nthey reached El Burgo, four or five miles farther on.\r\n\r\nThe scene was very different on the other side of Vittoria, where\r\nD’Erlon’s army was pushing its way, in utter disorder, through the\r\nfields and by-paths over which the Parks and convoy were trying in\r\nvain to get off, and Gazan’s (farther to the south) was making a dash\r\nover ground of the most tiresome sort. For in the rugged tract east\r\nof Esquivel and Armentia such paths as there were mostly ran in the\r\nwrong direction--north and south instead of east and west--and it\r\nwas necessary to disregard them and to strike across country. Six\r\nsuccessive ravines lay in the way--marshy bottoms in which ran trifling\r\nbrooks descending toward the Zadorra--and several woods on the ridges\r\nbetween the ravines. Hill’s and Cole’s skirmishers were pressing in\r\nthe rear, and above, on the heights of Puebla, Morillo’s and Cameron’s\r\ntroops could be seen hurrying along with the intention of getting\r\nahead of the retreating masses. The confusion growing worse every\r\nmoment--for companies and battalions each struck out for the easiest\r\nline of retreat without regard for their neighbours--Gazan gave orders\r\nto abandon all the artillery, which was getting embogged, battery after\r\nbattery, in the ravines, and gave leave for every unit to shift for\r\nitself--general _sauve-qui-peut_. The horses were unhitched from the\r\nguns and caissons, many of the infantry threw off their packs, and the\r\narmy went off broadcast, some in the direction of Metauco and Arbulo,\r\nothers by village paths more to the south. The general stream finally\r\nflowed into the Salvatierra road, where it was covered by the Army of\r\nPortugal, which was making a much more orderly retreat[603]. English\r\neye-witnesses of this part of the battle complain bitterly that no\r\nhorsemen ever came up to assist the wearied 2nd Division infantry\r\nin the pursuit, and maintain that thousands of prisoners might have\r\nbeen taken by a few squadrons[604]. But all the cavalry seems to have\r\nbeen directed on Vittoria by the high road, and save Grant’s hussar\r\nbrigade none of it came into action. This is sufficiently proved by\r\nits casualty lists--in R. Hill’s, Ponsonby’s, Long’s, Victor Alten’s,\r\nand Fane’s brigades that day the total losses were one man killed\r\nand eleven wounded! Only Anson’s Light Dragoons in Graham’s corps\r\nand Grant’s regiments in the centre got into the fighting at all.\r\nThe rugged ground, it is true, was unfavourable for cavalry action\r\nin regular order, but it was almost as unfavourable for disordered\r\ninfantry escaping over ravines and ditches. Something was wrong here\r\nin the general direction of the mounted arm--perhaps it suffered from\r\nthe want of a responsible cavalry leader--the brigadiers dared not act\r\nfor themselves, and Bock (the senior cavalry officer) was not only\r\nshort-sighted in the extreme, but absent from the main battle all day\r\nin Graham’s corps. One cannot but suspect that Wellington’s thunderings\r\nin previous years, against reckless cavalry action, were always present\r\nin the minds of colonels and brigadiers who had a chance before them.\r\nAnd possibly, in the end, there was more gained by the avoidance of\r\nmistakes of rashness than lost by the missing of opportunities, if we\r\ntake the war as a whole. But at Vittoria it would most certainly appear\r\nthat the great mass of British cavalry might as well have been on the\r\nother side of the Ebro for all the good that it accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to speak of the chaos in the fields and roads east of\r\nVittoria. When the general _débâcle_ began King Joseph and Jourdan took\r\ntheir post on a low hill half a mile east of the town, and endeavoured\r\nto organize the departure of the Park and convoys--a hopeless task, for\r\nthe roads were blocked, and no one listened to orders. It was in vain\r\nthat aides-de-camp and orderlies were sent in all directions. Presently\r\na flood of fugitives were driven in upon the staff, by the approach\r\nof British cavalry in full career. These were Grant’s 10th and 18th\r\nHussars, who had turned the town on its left, and galloped down on the\r\nprey before them. Joseph had only with him the two squadrons of his\r\nLancers of the Guard, which had been acting as head-quarters escort\r\nall day. It would appear that the Guard Hussars came up to join them\r\nabout this time. At any rate, these two small regiments made a valiant\r\nattempt to hold off the hussars--they were of course beaten, being\r\nhopelessly outnumbered[605]. The King and staff had to fly as best\r\nthey could, and were much scattered, galloping over fields and marshy\r\nravines, mixed with military and civil fugitives of all sorts. Some of\r\nthe British hussars followed the throng, taking a good many prisoners\r\nby the way: more, it is to be feared, stopped behind to gather the\r\nnot too creditable first-fruits of victory, by plundering the royal\r\ncarriages, which lay behind the scene of their charge. The French\r\nstragglers had already shown them the way.\r\n\r\nWellington, on reaching Vittoria, set Robert Hill’s brigade of the\r\nHousehold Cavalry to guard the town from plunder, and sent on the\r\nrest of the horse, and the infantry as they came up, in pursuit of\r\nthe enemy. The French, however, had by now a good start, and troops\r\nin order cannot keep up with troops in disorder, who have got rid of\r\ntheir impedimenta, and scattered themselves. The country, moreover,\r\nwas unfavourable for cavalry, as has been said above, and the\r\ninfantry divisions were tired out. The chase ended five miles beyond\r\nVittoria--the enemy, when last seen, being still on the run, with no\r\nformed rearguard except on the side road where the Army of Portugal was\r\nretreating.\r\n\r\nIf the prisoners were fewer than might have been expected, the material\r\ncaptured was such as no European army had ever laid hands on before,\r\nsince Alexander’s Macedonians plundered the camp of the Persian king\r\nafter the battle of Issus. The military trophies compared well even\r\nwith those of Leipzig and Waterloo--151 guns, 415 caissons, 100\r\nartillery waggons. Probably no other army ever left _all_ its artillery\r\nsave two solitary pieces in the enemy’s hands[606]. There was but one\r\nflag captured, and that was only the standard of a battalion of the\r\n100th Line which had been reduced in May, and had not been actually\r\nborne in the battle[607]. The baton of Jourdan, as Marshal of the\r\nEmpire, was an interesting souvenir, which delighted the Prince Regent\r\nwhen it arrived in London[608], but only bore witness to the fact that\r\nhis personal baggage, like that of his King, had been captured. A few\r\nthousand extra prisoners--the total taken was only about 2,000--would\r\nhave been more acceptable tokens of victory.\r\n\r\nBut non-military spoil was enormous--almost incredible. It represented\r\nthe exploitation of Spain for six long years by its conquerors. ‘To\r\nthe accumulated plunder of Andalusia were added the collections made\r\nby the other French armies--the personal baggage of the King--fourgons\r\nhaving inscribed on them in large letters “_Domaine extérieur de S.M.\r\nl’Empereur_”--the military chest containing the millions recently\r\nreceived from France for the payment of the Army, and not yet\r\ndistributed--jewels, pictures, embroidery, silks, all manner of things\r\ncostly and portable had been assiduously transported thus far. Removed\r\nfrom their frames and rolled up carefully, were the finest Italian\r\npictures from the royal collections of Madrid: they were found in the\r\n“imperials” of Joseph’s own carriages. All this mixed with cannon,\r\noverturned coaches, broken-down waggons, forsaken tumbrils, wounded\r\nsoldiers, French and Spanish civilians, women and children, dead horses\r\nand mules, absolutely covered the face of the country, extending\r\nover the surface of a flat containing many hundred acres[609].’\r\nThe miserable crowd was guessed by an eye-witness to have numbered\r\nnearly 20,000 persons. Spanish and French camp-followers and military\r\nstragglers had already started plunder--on them supervened English and\r\nPortuguese civil and military vultures of the same sort--servants and\r\nmuleteers by the thousand, bad soldiers by the hundred: for while the\r\ngood men marched on, the bad ones melted out of the ranks and flew to\r\nthe spoil, evading the officers who tried to urge them on. In such a\r\nchaos evasion was easy. Nor were the commissioned ranks altogether\r\nwithout their unobtrusive seekers after gain--as witness the subjoined\r\nnarrative by one whom a companion in a contemporary letter describes as\r\na ‘graceless youth.’\r\n\r\n‘As L. and I rode out of Vittoria, we came to the camp in less than a\r\nmile. On the left-hand side of the road was a heap of ransacked waggons\r\nalready broken up and dismantled. There arose a shout from a number\r\nof persons among the waggons, and we found that they had discovered\r\none yet unopened. We cantered up and found some men using all possible\r\nforce to break open three iron clasps secured with padlocks. On the\r\nside of the fourgon was painted “Le Lieutenant-Général Villatte.” The\r\nhasps gave way, and a shout followed. The whole surface of the waggon\r\nwas packed with church plate, mixed with bags of dollars. A man who\r\nthrust his arm down said that the bottom was full of loose dollars\r\nand boxes. L. and I were the only ones on horseback, and pushed close\r\nto the waggon. He swung out a large chalice, and buckling it to his\r\nholster-strap cantered off. As the people were crowding to lay hold of\r\nthe plate, I noted a mahogany box about eighteen inches by two feet,\r\nwith brass clasps. I picked out four men, told them that the box was\r\nthe real thing, and if they would fetch it out we would see what it\r\nheld. They caught the idea: the box was very heavy. I led the way\r\nthrough the standing corn, six or seven feet high, to a small shed,\r\nwhere we put it down and tried to get it open. After several devices\r\nhad failed, two men found a large stone, and, lifting it as high as\r\nthey could, dropped it on the box. It withstood several blows, but at\r\nlength gave way. Gold doubloons and smaller pieces filled the whole\r\nbox, in which were mixed some bags with trinkets. Just then an Ordnance\r\nstore-keeper came up, and said there was no time to count shares: he\r\nwould go round and give a handfull in turn to each. He first poured\r\na double handfull into my holster. The second round was a smaller\r\nhandfull. By this time I was reflecting that I was the only officer\r\npresent, and in rather an awkward position. I said they might have\r\nthe rest of my share,--there was first a look of surprise, and then a\r\nburst of laughter, and I trotted away. I rode eight or ten miles to\r\nthe bivouack and found the officers in an ancient church--housed à la\r\nCromwell. On the 23rd, before we left our quarters, I and ---- went up\r\ninto the belfry, and counted out the gold--the doubloons alone made\r\nnearly £400. I remitted £250 to my father, and purchased another horse\r\nwith part of the balance[610].’\r\n\r\nGeneral Villatte, no doubt, had special facilities in Andalusia--but\r\nevery fourgon and carriage contained something that had been worth\r\ncarrying off. The amount of hard cash discovered was almost incredible.\r\nMen and officers who had been self-respecting enough to avoid the\r\nunseemly rush at the waggons, had wonderful bargains at a sort of\r\nimpromptu fair or auction which was held among the débris of the convoy\r\nthat night. Good mules were going for three guineas--horses for ten.\r\nEvery one wished to get rid of the heavy duros and five-franc pieces,\r\nwhich constituted the greater part of the plunder; six and eight\r\ndollars respectively were offered and taken for a gold twenty-franc\r\npiece or a guinea. ‘The camp was turned into a fair--it was lighted\r\nup, the cars, &c., made into stands, upon which the things taken\r\nwere exposed for sale. Many soldiers, to add to the absurdity of the\r\nscene, dressed themselves up in uniforms found in the chests. All the\r\nPortuguese boys belonging to some divisions are dressed in the uniforms\r\nof French officers--many of generals[611].’\r\n\r\nWellington had hoped to secure the five million francs of the French\r\nsubsidy which had just arrived at Vittoria before the battle. His\r\nexpectations were deceived; only one-twentieth of the sum was\r\nrecovered, though an inquisitorial search was made a few days later in\r\nsuspected quarters. One regiment, which had notoriously prospered, was\r\nmade to stack its knapsacks on the 23rd, and they were gone through in\r\ndetail by an assistant provost-marshal--but little was found: the men\r\nhad stowed away their gains in belts and secret pockets; or deposited\r\nthem with quartermasters and commissaries who were known to be honest\r\nand silent.\r\n\r\nThe only feature in this discreditable scene that gives the historian\r\nsome satisfaction is to know that there was no mishandling of\r\nprisoners--not even of prominent Spanish traitors. The only person\r\nrecorded to have been killed in the chaos was M. Thiébault, the King’s\r\ntreasurer, who fought to defend his private strong-box containing\r\n100,000 dollars, and got shot[612]. The women were particularly well\r\ntreated--the Countess Gazan, wife of the Commander of the Army of the\r\nSouth, was sent by Wellington’s orders in her own carriage to join her\r\nhusband--a courtesy acknowledged by several French diarists[613]. The\r\nsame leave was given later to many others, and the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwrote to the Spanish Ministry to beg that no vengeance might be taken\r\non the captured _afrancesados_, and seems to have secured his end in\r\nthe main.\r\n\r\nThe French loss in the battle, according to the definitive report made\r\nfrom the head-quarters of the three armies after they had got back\r\ninto France, was 42 officers and 716 men killed, 226 officers and\r\n4,210 men wounded, and 23 officers and 2,825 prisoners or missing--a\r\ntotal of 8,091. It is known that of the ‘missing’ some hundreds were\r\nstragglers who rejoined later, and some other hundreds dead men, who\r\nhad not got into the list of killed. The total number of prisoners did\r\nnot really exceed 2,000. But on the other hand the official returns are\r\nincomplete, not giving any figures for the artillery or train of the\r\nArmies of Portugal and the Centre, or for the Royal Guards (which lost\r\n11 officers and therefore probably 150 to 200 men), or for the General\r\nStaff (which had 35 casualties), or for the stray troops of the Army of\r\nthe North present in the battle. Probably the real total, therefore,\r\nwas very much about the 8,000 men given by the official return.\r\n\r\nThe Allied casualties were just over 5,000--of whom 3,672 were British,\r\n921 Portuguese, and 552 Spaniards. A glance at the table in the\r\nAppendix will show how unequally they were distributed. Seven-tenths of\r\nthe whole loss fell on the 2nd and 3rd Divisions, with Grant’s brigade\r\nof the 7th, Robinson’s of the 5th, and Stubbs’s Portuguese in the 4th.\r\nThese troops furnished over 3,500 of the total loss of 5,158. The 1st\r\nDivision (54 casualties), the British brigades of the 4th Division (125\r\ncasualties), Hay’s and Spry’s brigades of the 5th (200 casualties),\r\nBarnes’ and Lecor’s of the 7th (no casualties[614]), the Light Division\r\n(132 casualties), Silveira’s Division (10 casualties), the cavalry (155\r\ncasualties) had no losses of importance. The 266 men marked as missing\r\nwere all either dead or absent marauding, save 40 of the 71st whom the\r\nFrench took prisoners to Pampeluna. The Spanish loss of 14 officers\r\nand 524 men was entirely in Morillo’s and Longa’s Divisions, and much\r\nheavier among the Estremadurans, who fought so well on the heights of\r\nLa Puebla, than among the Cantabrians who skirmished all day at Durana.\r\nGiron’s Galicians were never engaged, having only arrived in the rear\r\nof Graham’s column just as the fighting north of the Zadorra was over.\r\nThey encamped round Arriaga at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nThat the battle of Vittoria was the crowning-point of a very brilliant\r\nstrategic campaign is obvious. That in tactical detail it was not by\r\nany means so brilliant an example of what Wellington and his army could\r\naccomplish, is equally obvious. Was the General’s plan to blame? or\r\nwas a well-framed scheme wrecked by the faults of subordinates? It is\r\nalways a dangerous matter to criticize Wellington’s arrangements--so\r\nmuch seems clear to the historian that could not possibly have been\r\nknown to the soldier on the morning of June 21st. It is obvious to us\r\nnow that there was a fair chance not only of beating the French army,\r\nand of cutting off its retreat on Bayonne, but of surrounding and\r\ndestroying at least a considerable portion of it. Wellington’s orders\r\nare always extremely reticent in stating his final aims, and give a\r\nlist of things to be done by each division, rather than a general\r\nappreciation of what he intends the army to accomplish. But reading\r\nhis directions to Graham, Hill, and Dalhousie, and looking at the way\r\non which they work out on the map, and the allocation of forces in\r\neach column, it would seem that in view of the distribution of the\r\nFrench troops on the afternoon of June 20th, he planned a complete\r\nencircling scheme, which should not only accomplish what he actually\r\ndid accomplish, but much more. Graham, with his 20,000 men, must have\r\nbeen intended not only to force the line of the Zadorra and cut the\r\nRoyal Road, but to fall upon the rear of the whole French army, which\r\non the afternoon of the 20th had been seen to have a most inadequate\r\nflank-guard towards the north-east. Hill’s 20,000 men were not, as\r\nJourdan thought, the only main attack, nor as Gazan (equally in error)\r\nthought, a mere demonstration. They were intended to make an encircling\r\nmovement to the south, as strong as Graham’s similar movement to the\r\nnorth. But obviously both the flanking columns, Hill’s far more than\r\nGraham’s, were in danger of being repulsed, if the French could turn\r\nlarge unemployed reserves upon them. Wherefore the central attacks, by\r\nthe 4th and Light Divisions on the Nanclares side, and by the 3rd and\r\n7th Divisions on the Mendoza side, were necessary in order to contain\r\nany troops which Jourdan might have sent off to overwhelm Hill or\r\nGraham.\r\n\r\nAnd here comes the weak point of the whole scheme--all the movements\r\nhad to be made through defiles and over rough country: Hill had to\r\ndebouch from the narrow pass of Puebla, Graham had a long mountain\r\nroad from Murguia, and, worst of all, Dalhousie, with the 3rd and 7th\r\nDivisions, had to cross the watershed of a very considerable mountain\r\nby mere peasants’ tracks. Only the column which marched from the\r\nBayas to Nanclares had decent going on a second-rate road. There was,\r\ntherefore, a considerable danger that some part of the complicated\r\nscheme might miscarry. And any failure at one point imperilled the\r\nwhole, since the Nanclares column was not to act till Hill was well\r\nforward, and the Mendoza column was ordered to get into touch with the\r\ntroops to its right, and regulate its movements by them; while Graham,\r\nstill farther off, was also to guide himself by what was going on upon\r\nhis right, to correct himself with the Mendoza column, and only to\r\nattack on the Bilbao road when it should be seen that an attack would\r\nbe obviously useful to the main advance.\r\n\r\nHill discharged his part of the scheme to admiration, as he always did\r\nanything committed to him, and took up the attention of the main part\r\nof the Army of the South. But the central and left attacks did not\r\nproceed as Wellington had desired. Graham got to his destined position\r\nwithin the time allotted to him, but when he had reached it, was slow\r\nand unenterprising in his action. He was seeking for Dalhousie’s\r\ncolumn, with which he had been directed to co-ordinate his operations:\r\nhe sent out cavalry scouts and Bradford’s Portuguese to his right, but\r\ncould find nothing. This, I think, explains but does not wholly excuse\r\nhis caution at noon. But it neither explains nor excuses at all his\r\ntactics after he had received, at two o’clock, Wellington’s orders\r\ntelling him to press the enemy hard, and make his power felt. With his\r\ntwo British divisions, the Portuguese of Pack and Bradford, and two\r\ncavalry brigades, he only made a genuine attack at one point, and did\r\nnot put into serious action (as the casualty lists show) more than\r\nfour battalions--those used at Gamarra Mayor. The whole left column\r\nwas contained by little more than half of its number of French troops.\r\nGraham says in his dispatch to Wellington that ‘in face of such force\r\nas the enemy showed it was evidently impossible to push a column across\r\nthe river by Gamarra bridge.’ He does not explain his inactivity at\r\nother points, except by mentioning that the enemy had ‘at least two\r\ndivisions in reserve on strong ground behind the river[615].’ There was\r\nreally only one brigade in reserve, and so far from being compelled to\r\nattack at Gamarra only, Graham had besides Arriaga bridge on the main\r\nroad, two other bridges open to assault (those of Goveo and Yurre),\r\nbesides at least one and probably three fords. All these more southern\r\npassages were watched by cavalry only, without infantry or guns. It\r\nis clear that Graham could have got across the Zadorra somewhere, if\r\nhe had tried. Very probably his quiescence was due to his failing\r\neyesight, which had been noticed very clearly by those about him during\r\nthis campaign[616]. The only part of his corps which did really useful\r\nwork was Longa’s Spanish division, which at least cut the Bayonne road\r\nat the proper place and time.\r\n\r\nBut if Graham’s tactics cannot be praised, Lord Dalhousie was even\r\nmore responsible for the imperfect consequence of the victory. Why\r\nWellington put this fussy and occasionally disobedient officer\r\nin charge of the left-centre column, instead of Picton, passes\r\nunderstanding. The non-arrival of the 7th Division, which was to lead\r\nthe attack, was due to incompetent work by him or his staff. He says in\r\nhis dispatch that he was delayed by several accidents to his artillery\r\n(Cairnes’s battery). But from his own narrative we see that the guns\r\ngot up almost as soon as his leading infantry brigade (Grant’s), while\r\nhis two rear brigades (Barnes and Le Cor) never reached the front in\r\ntime to fire a shot. What really happened was that for want of staff\r\nguidance, for which the divisional commander was responsible, these\r\ntroops did not take the path assigned to them, and went right over,\r\ninstead of skirting, the summit of Monte Arrato, making an apparently\r\nshort (and precipitous) cut, which turned out to be a very long\r\none[617]. So when Dalhousie did arrive, with one brigade and his guns,\r\nPicton had long been waiting by Las Guetas in a state of justifiable\r\nirritation. Finally, Dalhousie (lacking the greater part of his\r\ndivision) did not attack till he got peremptory orders to do so from\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief. Hence the extreme delay, which caused grave\r\nrisk to Hill’s wing, so long engaged without support. It is fair to\r\nadd that the delay had one good effect--since it led Jourdan to think\r\nthat his right was not going to be attacked, and therefore to send off\r\nVillatte’s and Cassagne’s divisions to the far left. If Dalhousie had\r\nadvanced an hour earlier, these divisions would have been near enough\r\nto support Leval. But this is no justification for the late arrival and\r\nlong hesitations of the commander of the 7th Division. Undoubtedly a\r\npart of the responsibility devolves on Wellington himself, for putting\r\nan untried officer in charge of a crucial part of the day’s operations,\r\nwhen he had in Picton an old and experienced tactician ready to hand.\r\n\r\nThe strategical plan was so good that minor faults of execution could\r\nnot mar its general success. Yet it must be remembered that, if all\r\nhad worked out with minute accuracy, the French army would have been\r\ndestroyed, instead of merely losing its artillery and train. And the\r\nfact that 55,000 men escaped to France, even if in sorry condition,\r\nmade the later campaign of the Pyrenees possible. There would have been\r\nno combats of Maya and Roncesvalles, no battles of Sorauren and St.\r\nMarcial, if the eight French divisions present at Vittoria had been\r\nannihilated, instead of being driven in disorder on to an eccentric\r\nline of retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII\r\n\r\nEXPULSION OF THE FRENCH FROM SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT OF CLAUSEL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock on the morning of June 22nd Wellington moved out from\r\nVittoria in pursuit of the French. Touch with them had been lost on\r\nthe preceding night, as the divisions which had fought the battle had\r\nceased to move on after dark, and had settled into bivouacs four or\r\nfive miles beyond the city. The enemy, on the other hand, had continued\r\nhis flight in the darkness, till sheer exhaustion compelled each man\r\nto throw himself down where he was, all order having been lost in most\r\nunits, and only Reille’s rearguard of the Army of Portugal having\r\nkept its ranks. About midnight the majority had run to a standstill,\r\nand the hills along the Salvatierra road began to be covered with\r\nthousands of little fires, round which small groups were cooking\r\nthe scanty rations that they had saved in their haversacks. ‘The\r\nimpromptu illumination had a very pretty effect: if the enemy had seen\r\nit he might have thought that we had rallied and were in order. But\r\nit was only next morning that the regiments began to coalesce, and\r\nreorganization was not complete till we got back to France. Generals\r\nwere seeking their divisions, colonels their regiments, officers\r\ntheir companies. They found them later--but one thing was never found\r\nagain--the crown of Spain, fallen for ever from the brow on which it\r\nwas not to be replaced[618].’ King Joseph himself, pushing on ahead of\r\nthe rout, reached Salvatierra, sixteen miles from the field, before he\r\ndismounted, and shared a meagre and melancholy supper with D’Erlon and\r\ntwo ministers, the Irish-Spaniard O’Farrill and the Frenchman Miot de\r\nMelito. To them entered later Jourdan, who had been separated from\r\nthe rest of the staff in the flight. He flung himself down to the\r\ntable, saying, ‘Well, gentlemen, they _would_ have a battle, and it is\r\na lost battle,’ after which no one said anything more. This was the\r\nold marshal’s reflection on the generals who, all through the retreat,\r\nhad been urging that it was shameful to evacuate Spain without risking\r\na general action. After three hours’ halt, sleep for some, but the\r\nwakefulness of exhaustion for others, the King’s party got to horse at\r\ndawn, and rode on toward Pampeluna, the army straggling behind them.\r\nIt was a miserable rainy day with occasional thunderstorms: every one,\r\nfrom Joseph to the meanest camp-follower, was in the same state of\r\nmental and physical exhaustion. But the one thing which should have\r\nfinished the whole game was wanting--there was practically no pursuit.\r\n\r\nOf Wellington’s nine brigades of cavalry only two, those of Grant\r\nand Anson, had been seriously engaged on the 21st, and had suffered\r\nappreciable losses. The other seven were intact, and had not been in\r\naction. It is obvious that they could not have been used to effect\r\nin the darkness of the night, and over rough ground and an unknown\r\ntrack. But why an early pursuit at dawn was not taken in hand it is\r\ndifficult to make out. Even the same promptness which had been shown\r\nafter Salamanca, and which had been rewarded by the lucky gleanings of\r\nGarcia Hernandez, was wanting on this occasion. There was no excuse for\r\nthe late start of the cavalry, and in consequence it rode as far as\r\nSalvatierra without picking up more than a few wounded stragglers and\r\nworn-out horses and mules. The French had gone off at dawn, and were\r\nmany miles ahead.\r\n\r\nThe infantry followed slowly; not only were the men tired by the\r\nlate marches and their legitimate exertions in the battle, but many\r\nthousands had spent the hours of darkness in a surreptitious visit to\r\nthe field of the convoy, and had come back to the regimental bivouac\r\nwith plunder of all kinds bought at the cost of a sleepless night. Many\r\nhad not come back at all, but were lying drunk or snoring among the\r\ndébris of the French camps. Wellington wrote in high wrath to Bathurst,\r\nthe Minister for War: ‘We started with the army in the highest order,\r\nand up to the day of the battle nothing could get on better. But that\r\nevent has (as usual)[619] annihilated all discipline. The soldiers of\r\nthe army have got among them about a million sterling in money, with\r\nthe exception of about 100,000 dollars, which were got for the military\r\nchest. They are incapable of marching in pursuit of the enemy, and\r\nare totally knocked up. Rain has come and increased the fatigue, and\r\nI am quite sure that we have now out of the ranks double the amount\r\nof our loss in the battle, and that we have more stragglers in the\r\npursuit than the enemy have, and never in one day make more than an\r\nordinary march. This is the consequence of the state of discipline in\r\nthe British army. We may gain the greatest victories, but we shall do\r\nno good till we so far alter our system as to force all ranks to do\r\ntheir duty. The new regiments are as usual worst of all. The ---- are a\r\ndisgrace to the name of soldier, in action as elsewhere: I shall take\r\ntheir horses from them, and send the men back to England, if I cannot\r\nget the better of them in any other manner[620].’\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is one of Wellington’s periodical explosions of\r\ngeneral indiscriminating rage against the army which, as he confessed\r\non other occasions, had brought him out of many a dangerous scrape by\r\nits sheer hard fighting. He went on a few days later with language that\r\ncan hardly be forgiven: ‘We have in the Service the scum of the earth\r\nas common soldiers, and of late years have been doing everything in our\r\npower, both by law and by publication, to relax the discipline by which\r\nalone such men can be kept in order. The officers of the lower ranks\r\nwill not perform the duty required from them to keep the soldiers in\r\norder. The non-commissioned officers are (as I have repeatedly stated)\r\nas bad as the men. It is really a disgrace to have anything to say to\r\nsuch men as some of our soldiers are[621].’ The Commander-in-Chief’s\r\nown panacea was more shooting, and much more flogging. All this\r\nlanguage is comprehensible in a moment of irritation, but was cruelly\r\nunjust to many corps which kept their discipline intact, never\r\nstraggled, and needed no cat-o’-nine-tails: there were battalions\r\nwhere the lash was unknown for months at a time. But Wellington usually\r\nignored the moral side of things: he seldom spoke to his men about\r\nhonour or patriotism or _esprit de corps_, and long years afterwards\r\nofficially informed a Royal Commission on the Army that ‘he had no idea\r\nof any great effect being produced on British soldiers by anything but\r\nthe immediate fear of corporal punishment.’ It is sad to find such\r\nmentality in a man of strict honour and high military genius. On this\r\nparticular occasion he, no doubt, did well to be angry: but were there\r\nno regiments which could have marched at dawn to keep up the pursuit?\r\nUndoubtedly there were many: Ponsonby’s heavy dragoons had ridden\r\nthrough the chaos of plunder without a man leaving the ranks, and had\r\nbivouacked five miles to the front of Vittoria. There were several\r\ninfantry brigades which had been so far to the left or the right in the\r\naction that they never came near the temptation, and only remembered\r\nthe night of the 21st as one of short commons and hard lying[622].\r\nPerhaps the sight of the disgraceful confusion in and about Vittoria\r\ngave the Commander-in-Chief an exaggerated impression of the general\r\ncondition of the army. And undoubtedly he had an absorbing night’s task\r\nbefore him, when he sat down to work out the entire recasting of his\r\noperations which the victory had made necessary.\r\n\r\nHis main design, as expressed in the order for the 22nd, was to send\r\nGiron and Longa into Biscay by the great Bayonne _chaussée_, to pursue\r\nMaucune’s convoy and to cut off, if possible, Foy and the garrison\r\nof Bilbao, while the Anglo-Portuguese army marched in pursuit of\r\nthe French main army on Pampeluna. Clausel had been heard of in the\r\ndirection of Logroño; a zealous and patriotic innkeeper had ridden 40\r\nmiles on the night of the 20th to report to Wellington the position of\r\nthe head of his column; and it was the knowledge that he was more than\r\na full day’s march from Vittoria which had enabled the arrangements for\r\nthe battle to be made with complete security against any intervention\r\non his part[623]. But, though it was most probable that he would\r\nhave heard of the disaster to the King’s army, and have turned back\r\nto Pampeluna or Saragossa, there was a chance that the news might not\r\nhave reached him. If so, he could be at Vittoria by the afternoon of\r\nthe 22nd, and his appearance there might prove very tiresome, as the\r\nBritish hospitals and the whole spoil of the battle would have been\r\nat his mercy. Wherefore Wellington, who somewhat underrated Clausel’s\r\nstrength[624], left behind at Vittoria the 5th Division and R. Hill’s\r\ncavalry brigade to guard the place: the 6th Division was due to arrive\r\nat noon, or not much later, from Medina de Pomar, so that 12,000 men\r\nwould be available if the possible but improbable event of a raid on\r\nVittoria should come to pass.\r\n\r\nThese precautions having been taken, the army marched off at ten\r\no’clock, in three columns, the ‘Centre Column’ of previous days\r\nwith head-quarters and the bulk of the cavalry sticking to the\r\nmain Salvatierra-Pampeluna road, while Hill and Graham kept to\r\nside-tracks[625], which were available so long as the march lay in the\r\nplain of Vittoria, but converged on Salvatierra, where the watershed\r\ncomes, and the mountains of Navarre block the way. Here all the roads\r\nmet, and there was a steep rise and a defile, before the head-waters of\r\nthe Araquil, the main river of north-western Navarre, were reached.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Wellington’s quartermaster-general, George Murray--about\r\nthe only man who ever dared to make a suggestion to his chief--asked\r\nhim whether it might not be worth while to send a detachment northward,\r\nby the mountain road which goes from Salvatierra to Villafranca on\r\nthe great Bayonne _chaussée_. For Giron and Longa might have been\r\ndetained by the French forts at the defile of Salinas, at Mondragon\r\nand elsewhere, and so have failed to get forward in their pursuit of\r\nMaucune’s convoy and the Bilbao garrison. But a force sent across\r\nthe hills from Salvatierra would cut in to the _chaussée_ behind\r\nthe fortified posts; and, if the convoy were moving slowly, might\r\ncatch it as it passed through Villafranca, or at any rate intercept\r\nother stray bodies of French troops[626]. Wellington approved the\r\nidea at once, and ordered Graham to take the greater part of his own\r\ncolumn--the 1st Division, Pack’s, and Bradford’s Portuguese, and\r\nAnson’s cavalry brigade,--to leave the pursuit of the King’s army, and\r\nto march to co-operate with the Spanish troops who had already been\r\ndetached to press the retreat of the French garrisons of Biscay. The\r\nroad Salvatierra-Villafranca turned out practicable for all arms, but\r\nvery trying both to cavalry and artillery, its first stage being a\r\nlong uphill pull, over a road of the most stony kind--on the watershed\r\nat the Puerto de San Adrian it was taken through a tunnel cut in the\r\nsolid rock. The diversion of Graham’s column being an afterthought--the\r\norders for it were only issued at 3 p.m.--there was some delay in\r\nfinding the troops in an afternoon of blinding rain, and turning them\r\non to the new direction. The general himself, as his dispatch shows,\r\nwas not reached by Wellington’s orders till next morning[627]. Only the\r\nlight brigade of the German Legion got well forward on the 22nd,--the\r\nrest of the 1st Division and Bradford’s Portuguese hardly got started.\r\nAnson’s Light Dragoons and Pack’s Portuguese, like Graham himself,\r\nnever received their orders at all that night, having pushed on beyond\r\nSalvatierra for two leagues or more, where the officers sent in search\r\nof them failed to catch them up. They had actually gone forward some\r\nmiles farther towards Navarre, on the morning of the 23rd, before\r\nthey were found and set right. This caused a tiresome counter-march\r\nof some miles to get back to Salvatierra and the cross-roads.\r\nWellington was much vexed with the bad staff-work, but vented his\r\nwrath, unfortunately, not on his own aides-de-camp but on a meritorious\r\nofficer whom they had failed to find or warn. Captain Norman Ramsay,\r\nthe hero of the ‘artillery charge’ at Fuentes de Oñoro[628], was\r\nattached with his battery to Anson’s cavalry brigade. He was still\r\nmoving eastward, on the night of the 22nd, when the Commander-in-Chief\r\nchanced to come upon him. Wellington at once ordered him to halt,\r\nbillet his men in a neighbouring village, and wait for new directions.\r\nAccording to Ramsay’s version of the words used, they were that ‘if\r\nthere were any orders for the troop in the course of the night, he\r\nwould send them[629].’ But Wellington was under the impression that\r\nthe phrase used was that Ramsay was not to move until he had direct\r\norders from Head-Quarters as to his route. Next morning about 6 a.m. an\r\nassistant quartermaster-general (Captain Campbell) came to the village,\r\nand asked Ramsay if he had yet received his directions. On hearing that\r\nhe had not, the staff-officer told him to follow Anson’s brigade, who\r\n(as Ramsay supposed) were still moving eastward; for no hint of the\r\nchange of route had been given him on the previous night. The battery\r\nwas started off again on the road towards Pampeluna, and its commander\r\nrode on ahead to seek for the cavalry to whom he was attached. At this\r\nmoment Wellington came up, expressed high wrath at finding the guns\r\non the move in the wrong direction, and asked for Ramsay, who was not\r\nforthcoming for some time. Whereupon the angry general ordered him to\r\nbe put under arrest for flagrant disobedience, and spoke of trying him\r\nby court martial. His version of the offence was that ‘Captain Ramsay\r\ndisobeyed a positive order given him verbally by me, in expectation of\r\na circumstance which occurred, namely that he might receive orders,\r\nfrom someone else to move as I did not wish him to move[630].’ It is\r\neasy to see how the vagueness in the wording of the order, or even a\r\nmisconception of the stress laid upon one of its clauses, brought about\r\nRamsay’s mistake. He understood that he was to halt till he got orders,\r\nand took Campbell’s message to be the orders meant. It is pretty clear\r\nfrom Wellington’s own language that Ramsay was not warned that he might\r\nreceive orders not directly proceeding from G.H.Q., which he was to\r\ndisregard entirely. Explanation of that kind would not have been in the\r\nWellingtonian manner.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate battery-commander, who had done splendid service on\r\nthe 21st, and had a brilliant record behind him, gained the sympathy\r\nof the whole army, and such senior officers as dared continued to\r\nmake intercession for his pardon. After keeping him for some weeks\r\nunder arrest, Wellington resolved not to try him, and to send him\r\nback to his battery. But he was cut out of the reward which he had\r\nearned at Vittoria, and did not receive the brevet advance in rank\r\nor the decorations given to the other battery-commanders, so that he\r\npractically lost ground in comparison with his equals and fell to the\r\nbottom of the list. This was a deadly blow to Ramsay, who was sensitive\r\nand full of professional pride: he kept silence--not so his comrades,\r\nwho filed the incident as another flagrant example of Wellington’s\r\ndislike for and injustice to the artillery arm[631]. He fell, still\r\nonly a battery-commander, at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe result of the miscarriage of orders on the night of the 22nd and\r\nthe morning of the 23rd was that Graham’s turning column was late in\r\nits movement. The general himself was one of the last to get the new\r\ndirection--the cavalry which should have been at the head of the march\r\nwas at its tail. The German Light Battalions were very far ahead of all\r\nthe other units, and had to hold back in order to let the rest come up.\r\nHence the attack on Villafranca was not delivered on the evening of the\r\n23rd, as it might have been, but on the afternoon of the 24th, and in\r\nthe intervening twenty-four hours the greater part of the French troops\r\nwhom Graham might have cut off filed through Villafranca on their way\r\nto Tolosa and the frontier, and only a flank-guard was brought to\r\naction. Of this more in its proper place.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the troops under Wellington’s immediate eye, the ‘Centre\r\nColumn’ and Hill’s corps, pursued their way on the 23rd along\r\nthe Salvatierra-Pampeluna road--only Victor Alten’s hussars got\r\nin touch with the tail of King Joseph’s fugitive host, which was\r\nmoving at a great pace and had a long start. There was now a proper\r\nrearguard--Cassagne’s division of the Army of the Centre, which had\r\nlost only 250 men at Vittoria, and had been more shaken than hurt,\r\nhaving replaced the much-tried Army of Portugal as the covering force.\r\nKing Joseph halted for some hours at Yrurzun, and there gave orders\r\nfor Reille to diverge from the main line of retreat, and to take\r\nhis two divisions, a cavalry brigade, and all the teams of his lost\r\nartillery by the route of Santesteban and the valley of the Bastan,\r\nback to the French frontier on the lower Bidassoa[632]. Finding himself\r\nso feebly pursued, he had jumped to the conclusion that Wellington\r\nmight have marched with the bulk of his force on the great _chaussée_,\r\nmaking directly for Irun and Bayonne. There being nothing to stop him\r\nsave the scattered detachments under Foy, an invasion of France was\r\npossible. Hence Reille was directed to join Foy in haste, and cover the\r\nline of the Bidassoa. Thus Graham and Reille were now moving parallel\r\nto each other, both in a direct northerly direction, but separated by\r\nmany a mile of impracticable mountains. The Armies of the South and\r\nCentre continued their retreat on Pampeluna.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wellington on the morning of the 23rd received some important\r\nnews from Vittoria. The unexpected had happened: Clausel having failed\r\nto hear of the King’s defeat--as chance would have it--was marching\r\non the city by the Trevino road. Pakenham had already arrived there,\r\nbut the 5th Division had gone forward to join the tail of Graham’s\r\ncolumn on being relieved by the 6th, nothing having yet been heard\r\nof the French till midday. The force on the spot, therefore, was\r\nrather weak, if Clausel had meant mischief. But he did not, and was\r\nbecoming aware of the danger of his own position. He had heard on\r\nthe 20th, when he was in march along the Ebro from Logroño on Haro,\r\nthat the King had evacuated Miranda that day, and was drawing back\r\nto Vittoria. It was obviously dangerous to seek to join him by the\r\nroad near the river, and Clausel on the 21st, the day of the battle,\r\nwas trying to recover touch with the main army by taking the route\r\nLa Guardia-Trevino. This détour removed him out of striking distance\r\nduring all the critical hours. By some strange chance he neither met\r\nany of the King’s aides-de-camp, who were hunting for him on all sides,\r\nnor fell in with any of the fugitives from the routed army either on\r\nthe night of the 21st nor on the morning of the 22nd. He resumed his\r\nmarch from La Guardia, and reached Trevino in the afternoon. There he\r\nheard from _afrancesados_ the news that there had been a disastrous\r\nbattle on the previous day, but could get no details. He therefore\r\ndetached some squadrons to explore along the mountain road from Trevino\r\nto Vittoria--they made their way as far as the crest of the heights of\r\nPuebla, above Berostigueta, driving in first some Spanish irregulars,\r\nand then picquets of British cavalry; from the watershed they could see\r\nallied troops getting into order, but not their numbers. Pakenham, on\r\nbeing warned by the guerrilleros, had occupied Vittoria town with two\r\nPortuguese battalions, drawn up the rest of his troops for a fight, and\r\nsent to warn Oswald and the 5th Division, as well as Giron’s Spaniards,\r\nwho had not gone many miles yet, that trouble was at hand. Both of\r\nthese forces halted and prepared to turn back.\r\n\r\nBut on hearing the report of his horsemen Clausel had no thought of a\r\nraid on Vittoria: his only idea was to get out of danger, and rejoin\r\nthe main army as quickly as possible. That Joseph and Jourdan had been\r\nbeaten, he was now aware; but details were wanting: he did not know\r\nwhether the rout had been complete, or whether the King’s army was\r\ncapable of rallying and making head at Pampeluna. If he had understood\r\nthat all the artillery had been lost, and that a retreat into France\r\nwas imminent, he might probably have given up the idea of a junction,\r\nand have set out in haste to retire on Saragossa, by way of the main\r\nroad down the Ebro by Logroño and Tudela. But not knowing this, his\r\nfirst plan was to march for Salvatierra by the mountainous road which\r\ngoes from Viana on the Ebro to the upper valley of the Ega. On the 23rd\r\nhe marched from Trevino to Viana, on the 24th he started out from that\r\nplace and went 20 miles as far as Santa Cruz de Campero, where he heard\r\nthat Mina and all his bands were on his flank, and that an English\r\ncolumn was coming down upon him from Salvatierra. The latter rumour was\r\nfalse, but induced Clausel to abandon any idea of taking a short cut to\r\njoin the King. It would seem also that he had picked up some news as to\r\nthe crushing effect of Vittoria on the French army, and knew that it\r\nmust have fallen back on Pampeluna. He hurriedly retraced his steps,\r\npicked up the garrison of Logroño and set out to move on Pampeluna\r\nby the Mendavia-Puente la Reyna road late on the 25th. His vanguard\r\nhad got as far as Sesma when he heard that Mina had dropped down from\r\nEstella to Lerin, blocking this road also. It might have been possible\r\nto attack and beat him, but renewed reports that the British were also\r\napproaching disturbed Clausel, and he swerved back to the Ebro by\r\ncross-roads and crossed it at Lodosa on the 26th.\r\n\r\nThis move, which placed him on the high road from Logroño to Saragossa,\r\nimplied the abandonment of all hope of reaching Pampeluna and joining\r\nthe King. He had resolved to fall back on Aragon and seek refuge with\r\nSuchet’s troops in that direction. But he had lost much time in his\r\ncounter-marches, and was on the 27th in greater danger than he knew,\r\nsince Wellington was now coming down from the north, in the hope of\r\nheading him off and cutting his line of retreat. And if Clausel had\r\nlost as much time in the next five days as he had in the last, his\r\nposition would have been most desperate, for Wellington had ascertained\r\nhis whereabouts, and was marching upon him in great strength, with\r\na good hope of intercepting him, if he were still adhering to his\r\noriginal plan of making for Pampeluna and rejoining the King.\r\n\r\nThe idea that Clausel might be caught and destroyed had come to the\r\nBritish general’s mind on the 26th, when he had reached the environs\r\nof Pampeluna, and had made sure that the whole of King Joseph’s armies\r\nwere well on the road for France. The pursuit had been little more\r\nfruitful on the 24th-25th than it had been on the 22nd-23rd. But at\r\nleast closer contact had been secured with the enemy: on the afternoon\r\nof the 24th the leading British troops had brought D’Erlon’s rearguard\r\nto action at the passage of the Araquil, in front of the cross-roads\r\nat Yrurzun. This combat, in which the 1st German Hussars, the 1st and\r\n3rd battalions of the 95th, and Ross’s battery were engaged against\r\nDarmagnac’s division of the Army of the Centre[633] cost the enemy\r\nabout 100 casualties[634], and one of the only two guns which he\r\nhad brought off from Vittoria. It was a running fight, in which the\r\nrearguard all the way from Yrurzun to Berrioplano was being turned and\r\ndriven in. But no large captures were made.\r\n\r\nWhile this skirmish was in progress, on the afternoon of the 24th, the\r\nmain body of the French army was already on the march past Pampeluna\r\ntowards France. The troops were not allowed to enter the fortress,\r\nwhere only the King, his General Staff, and his courtiers lodged on\r\nthe night of the 24th. It was feared that the famished soldiery might\r\nplunder the stores if they got access to them, so they were taken round\r\nby suburban roads, which did not pass through the city. Gazan with\r\nthe Army of the South started on the evening of the 24th, taking the\r\nroute by Zubiri and the Pass of Roncesvalles to St. Jean-Pied-de-Port.\r\nD’Erlon set out nine hours later, at dawn on the 25th, using the better\r\nroad by the Col de Velate and the Pass of Maya, which took him to the\r\nBastan, whither Reille had gone before him. But while the Army of\r\nPortugal passed on to the lower Bidassoa, the Army of the Centre was\r\nordered to halt in the Bastan and hold its ground if possible.\r\n\r\nOnly three or four hours after D’Erlon’s column had left the suburbs\r\nof Pampeluna the first English vedettes showed themselves on the\r\nSalvatierra road. These came from Victor Alten’s light cavalry; they\r\ncoasted round the city on the south, and picqueted the Puente la Reyna\r\nand Tafalla roads, by either of which Clausel might conceivably be\r\non the move to join the King. But no trace of the French could be\r\nfound, save that of the retiring rearguard of the Army of the Centre.\r\nOf British infantry only the Light Division appeared in front of the\r\nfortress, on the side of Berrioplano, though the 4th and Grant’s\r\nhussars were close behind it. Picton and Dalhousie with the 3rd and 7th\r\nDivisions were still farther back on the Salvatierra road, and Hill’s\r\nwhole corps was told to halt until their predecessors should have\r\ncleared the way in front of them. The 5th Division, having received the\r\nalarm about Clausel’s raid on Vittoria, had turned back on the 23rd and\r\nwas a full march behind Hill. The 6th Division had now passed out of\r\nPakenham’s hands into those of Clinton, its normal commander, who had\r\njust come up from Lisbon[635]. It remained at Vittoria when all danger\r\nfrom Clausel was over, and had originally been intended to come in on\r\nthe rear of the 5th Division at Salvatierra, leaving the hospitals and\r\nspoils under the guard of some details[636]. But other orders were soon\r\nto reach it.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 25th Wellington got the news from Mina that\r\nClausel’s column, which he had supposed to be making a hasty retreat\r\ndown the Ebro, ever since its vain appearance in front of Vittoria on\r\nthe evening of the 22nd, was much less far off than he had supposed.\r\nOwing to its counter-marches on the 23rd-24th it had only just got\r\nback to Logroño, and had started off from that town on the 25th by the\r\nroad north of the Ebro via Mendavia and Sesma, apparently heading for\r\nPampeluna. If this were Clausel’s game, he might be intercepted and\r\ncaught, and allied columns might thrust themselves between him and his\r\nescape towards Saragossa or Jaca. The nearer he got to Pampeluna the\r\nbetter, since the French main army was no longer there, but in rapid\r\nmarch for its native soil.\r\n\r\nThe orders which Wellington had issued upon the afternoon of the 25th\r\nfor the movements of the army on the 26th, had contemplated nothing\r\nmore than the investment of Pampeluna by the 3rd and 7th Divisions on\r\nthe north side, and the Light and 4th Divisions on the south side of\r\nthe Arga. But the news which had come in from Mina caused a complete\r\nchange in his plans: the morning orders of the 26th direct Cole, with\r\nthe 4th and Light Divisions, not to linger near Pampeluna, but to\r\nmove off as far as the men could go on the Tudela road--to Mendavil,\r\nhalf-way to Tafalla, if possible: Grant’s hussar brigade was to push\r\nahead in front of the infantry, and discover whether Clausel was to\r\nbe heard of on this road, or perhaps on the Estella-Puente la Reyna\r\nroad, which was an alternative (if less likely) track for him to take\r\nif marching on Pampeluna. Hill was ordered to hurry up from the rear,\r\nand replace in the blockade not only the troops of Cole, but those of\r\nPicton and Dalhousie. For the 3rd and 7th Divisions were to get ready\r\nto follow Cole’s column the moment that they were relieved: they were\r\nto concentrate meanwhile at the village of Sielvas, south of the Arga,\r\nand to march southward as soon as Hill came up. But it was calculated\r\nthat they would not be able to move till dawn on the 27th, as Hill had\r\na long way to come. Ponsonby’s cavalry brigade would attach itself to\r\nthem when the move should begin. Meanwhile, four divisions being set in\r\nmotion to head off Clausel from this side, another column was ordered\r\nto strike across the mountains and fall in on his rear if possible.\r\nThe 6th Division was still at Vittoria on the 25th, as was R. Hill’s\r\nbrigade of heavy cavalry. Clinton (now commanding his old division in\r\nlieu of Pakenham) received orders to start off with all speed on the\r\nLogroño road, taking the Household Cavalry with him, and to endeavour\r\nto catch up the retreating French. He made forced marches via Trevino\r\nand Peñacerrada, and reached Logroño on the 27th, where he picked up\r\nsix abandoned French guns, but learned that Clausel had been gone for\r\ntwo days, and had crossed the Ebro at Lodosa instead of continuing on\r\nthe Pampeluna road. There was little chance of catching him up, when he\r\nhad a start of two marches, but Clinton continued the pursuit as far as\r\nLerin on the Miranda-de-Arga road, where he gave it up. The Household\r\nCavalry returned to Logroño, where it was directed to go into billets,\r\nas horsemen would not be wanted in the Pyrenees, while the 6th Division\r\nmarched at leisure from Lerin to Pampeluna[637].\r\n\r\nThe only real chance of catching Clausel was to head him off at Tudela,\r\nby means of the four divisions which were descending upon him down the\r\nTafalla road. But a glance at the map will show that he could only\r\nhave been intercepted if he had displayed uncommon torpidity. For\r\nhaving crossed the Ebro at Lodosa on the 26th he was only 35 miles from\r\nTudela on a good road: and marching hard he reached the town on the\r\nafternoon of the 27th, when the advanced cavalry of the column sent to\r\nintercept him had only got to Olite, 25 miles to the north, and the\r\nLight Division at the head of the infantry column was 10 miles behind\r\nat Barasoain. Clausel did not halt more than a few hours at Tudela:\r\nthere was no need for the intervention of the treacherous alcalde--who\r\nfigures in legends of the time--to bid him press on hard for Saragossa.\r\nFor the design, attributed to him by some of the contemporary British\r\ndiarists, of marching up from Tudela along the Aragon river, with the\r\nobject of reaching France and joining the King by way of Sanguesa was\r\nnever really in his mind. Ever since he had crossed the bridge of\r\nLodosa his only desire was to get to Saragossa in the shortest possible\r\ntime. Starting off again at dawn on the 28th, with his force increased\r\nby the garrison of Tudela, he marched that day twenty miles to Mallen,\r\nand on the 29th a similar distance to Alagon. On the 30th a shorter\r\nstage of 15 miles brought him to Saragossa, where he found General\r\nParis, the Governor of Aragon, still completely ignorant of the battle\r\nof Vittoria, though it had taken place nine days back.\r\n\r\nSince the 26th Clausel had been practically out of danger, for he\r\nhad the Ebro, whose bridges at Lodosa and Tudela he had destroyed,\r\nbetween him and Wellington’s columns. There was no force which could\r\nhave stopped him, for there are 20 miles less of road between Lodosa\r\nand Tudela than between Pampeluna and Tudela. Wellington had hoped\r\nfor a moment that Mina might have intercepted the French column at\r\nTudela, and have held it in check long enough to allow the British to\r\ncome up. But though Mina was, so far as mere distances went, capable\r\nof striking at Tudela, two things prevented him from being able to do\r\nso--the first was the obstacle of the Ebro, the second the fact that\r\nTudela was a fortified place with a competent garrison. Even if the\r\ngreat guerrillero had got his men across the river, he certainly could\r\nnot have captured Tudela, and equally certainly would have been beaten\r\nby Clausel, when the French column--double his available force in\r\nnumbers--came up, if he had dared to offer battle in the open near the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 27th Wellington heard that Clausel had\r\nslipped past Tudela in haste, and that Mina, quite unable to stop\r\nhim, was only able to follow him with his cavalry--to which Julian\r\nSanchez’s Lancers had joined themselves. At a very early hour on the\r\n28th--before 5 o’clock in the morning--the British Commander-in-Chief\r\nissued a fresh set of orders in view of this untoward news[638]. They\r\nare a little difficult to understand, but internal evidence seems to\r\nshow that Wellington must have received some sort of report tending\r\nto make him think it possible that Clausel, instead of falling back\r\non Saragossa and joining Suchet’s army, might march across country\r\nby the road Tauste-Exea-Un Castillo-Jaca, or the alternative road\r\nExea-Luna-Murillo-Jaca, in order to cross the Pyrenees by the pass of\r\nCanfranc and join the King’s army in Bearn. Or he might march through\r\nSaragossa in haste, and make for Jaca by the Gallego river[639].\r\nThere was a bare possibility of intercepting him by turning the whole\r\npursuing column eastward, and taking it into the valley of the river\r\nAragon, from which it would march by Sanguesa and Berdun on Jaca. The\r\nweak point of the scheme was that there was no certainty that Clausel\r\nwould march on Jaca at all: he might stop in Aragon and combine his\r\noperations with those of Suchet. Or even if he did start for Jaca, when\r\nhe heard that his road was intercepted by British troops, he would\r\nnaturally turn back and cast in his lot with the French Army of Aragon,\r\nrather than with the King.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore rather surprising to find that Wellington imposed two\r\ndays of heavy marching on his left wing, on the bare possibility that\r\nClausel might be intercepted at or near Jaca. The orders for the 28th\r\nJune were for the cavalry at the head of the column to make the long\r\nmarch Olite-Caparrosa-Caseda, by the good but circuitous road along the\r\nvalley of the Aragon, taking in charge the artillery belonging to the\r\ninfantry divisions. The latter were to cut across from the Pampeluna to\r\nthe Sanguesa roads by country tracks in the hills--the Light Division\r\nby Olite-Beyre-Gallipienzo, the 4th Division by Tafalla-St. Martin de\r\nUnx-Gallipienzo. The 3rd and 7th Divisions, farther behind, went from\r\nMendavil by Olleta to Caseda. This move concentrated 30,000 men in a\r\nsolid body on a decent road--but left a very long gap between them and\r\nthe troops blockading Pampeluna--and the gap would grow longer each\r\nday that the marching force pushed north-eastward up the course of the\r\nAragon on its way to Jaca[640].\r\n\r\nOn the following day (June 29th) the column, now with the 3rd Division\r\nat its head and the 4th Division at its tail, had moved along the river\r\ntill its head reached Sanguesa, when Wellington suddenly made up his\r\nmind to relinquish the scheme, which (as he himself owned) had never\r\nbeen a very promising one. He wrote to Castaños that Clausel, having\r\npassed Tudela marching hard for Saragossa, had got too long a start,\r\nand could not be caught. The plan of intercepting him at Jaca had been\r\ngiven up, firstly because it would probably have failed, and secondly\r\nbecause, if it had succeeded, it would only have forced Clausel to join\r\nSuchet--which was not a thing to be desired[641]. A third reason, which\r\nhe did not cite to Castaños but reserved for Lord Bathurst’s private\r\neye, was that the Army was marching very badly, with many stragglers,\r\nand many marauders. ‘The British on the 17th June were 41,547 rank\r\nand file: on the 29th, 35,650 rank and file--diminution, 5,897.\r\nNow the loss in the battle was 3,164--so that the diminution from\r\nirregularities, straggling, &c., for plunder, is 2,733.’ The Portuguese\r\nbefore the battle were 25,489--their present strength is 23,044. As\r\nthey lost only 1,022 in the battle, they show an extra diminution of\r\nanother 1,423 rank and file, from the same causes as the British.\r\n‘There are only 160 men in the hospital which I established--the others\r\nare plundering the country in different directions.’ The truth was,\r\nthat the Army was sulky--the men had not got over the effects of the\r\nlooting at Vittoria, the weather had been bad, and the hunt after\r\nClausel had been regarded by officers and men alike as a wild-goose\r\nchase.\r\n\r\nThe French General gave his men three days’ rest at Saragossa (June\r\n30-July 2) and then started to march up the Gallego river to Jaca,\r\nwhere the head of his column arrived on July 6th: he then halted his\r\ndivisions for some days, stopping in a position where he could either\r\ncross the pass of Canfranc into France, for he had no field-guns or\r\nwheeled transport with him, to impede his passage by that steep defile,\r\nor else return into the plains of Aragon. If Suchet should come to\r\nSaragossa with the Army of Valencia, he could drop back to meet him.\r\nBut on the 11th arrived the news that Saragossa had been evacuated\r\non the preceding day, after some indecisive fighting between General\r\nParis’s garrison and the bands of Mina and Duran, who had beset the\r\ncity on both sides of the Ebro. All chance of a junction with Suchet\r\nhaving vanished, Clausel crossed the Pyrenees next day, after leaving\r\na garrison in Jaca. He came down into the Val d’Aspe on the French\r\nside, with 11,000 infantry, 500 horse, and six mountain guns packed on\r\nmules--his sole artillery. He had lost somewhere about 1,500 men in his\r\nlong march--some broken-down stragglers, others sick left in hospital\r\nat Tudela and Saragossa. All these fell into the hands of Mina, but the\r\ncasualties in actual fighting had been practically _nil_. By July 15th\r\nthe whole column, marching over the Pyrenean foot-hills, had reached\r\nSt. Jean-Pied-de-Port, and come into touch with the Armies of the South\r\nand Centre, who had so long and vainly desired to see Clausel.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wellington, having stopped his eastward march on June 29th,\r\nhad given his troops one day’s rest, and then drawn them back toward\r\nPampeluna by the road through Monreal. He was now about to take up the\r\npursuit of the King’s troops, which had been abandoned on the 25th\r\nwhile he went off on his fruitless hunt after Clausel--an enterprise\r\nwhich would have been far better left to Mina and the guerrilleros, for\r\nthere never had been much probability of its succeeding. But the new\r\nmove required several days of preparation, since four divisions had\r\nto be brought back from the valley of the Aragon, and one more, the\r\n6th, to come up from Lerin via Puente La Reyna. And it was necessary\r\nto provide a considerable force for the blockade of Pampeluna. The\r\ninstructions for July 1 were that Hill was to make the first move, by\r\nmarching northward with the 2nd Division, handing over the investment\r\nof Pampeluna to Silveira’s Portuguese and Morillo’s Spaniards[642], to\r\nwhose assistance there would come up in 24 hours the 7th Division, and\r\na little later the 3rd Division. Hill was to march by the Col de Velate\r\nand Santesteban into the Bastan, from which it was intended that he\r\nshould drive out D’Erlon’s divisions.\r\n\r\nBut these operations belong to the fighting of July, and before dealing\r\nwith them it is necessary to go back to June 22nd, in order to follow\r\nthe fortunes of the other large French force, which might have been\r\npresent at the battle of Vittoria, but was not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT OF FOY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left General Foy at the decisive moment when he received the\r\ndispatch forwarded by Thouvenot from Vittoria, which informed him of\r\nthe King’s retreat beyond the Ebro, and suggested that he might come\r\nin to join the main army, but left him the fatal choice of deciding\r\nwhether his own immediate operations were or were not of such paramount\r\nimportance that they could not be abandoned[643]. Foy decided, and many\r\nother generals have made a similar error in all ages, that his own\r\njob was the really important thing. The dispatch reached him on the\r\n19th, when he had his division concentrated at Bergara, and could have\r\nbrought it to Vittoria in time for the battle. Probably the brigade\r\nof Berlier, belonging to the Army of the North, which was under his\r\norders, could also have been brought in from Villafranca to Vittoria by\r\nthe 21st.\r\n\r\nBut on the very eve of the decisive engagement, and with Jourdan’s\r\ndispatch advising him ‘de se rapprocher de Vittoria’ before his eyes,\r\nFoy decided that the petty affairs of the Biscay garrisons were of\r\nmore importance than the fate of the King’s Army. Instead of bringing\r\ndown his own and Berlier’s troops to Vittoria, where 5,000 bayonets\r\nwould have been most welcome to the depleted Army of Portugal, he\r\nproceeded to disperse them. He sent, on the 20th, two battalions to El\r\nOrrio to facilitate the retreat of the garrison of Bilbao, dispatched\r\ntwo others to Deba, on the coast, to guard against a rumoured British\r\ndemonstration against that port, and remained at Bergara with the\r\n6th Léger alone. Orders were forwarded to Berlier to stand fast\r\nat Villafranca, and to the troops expected from Bilbao to make the\r\nbest pace that they could, as the Army of Galicia would soon be upon\r\nthem[644]. Giron’s demonstration on the Balmaseda road had convinced\r\nFoy that the Spanish 4th Army was aiming at Bilbao--he could not know\r\nthat Wellington had brought the Galicians down by Orduña to join his\r\nmain body.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 21st the division of Maucune, escorting the\r\nconvoy which had started from Vittoria at dawn, came through the pass\r\nof Salinas unmolested. Its general met Foy, and told him that he had\r\nheard heavy cannonading for many hours behind him, but had no notion\r\nof what was going on upon the Zadorra. The column bivouacked between\r\nMondragon and Bergara, and started off again before daybreak. It had\r\nnot gone more than a league when fugitives began to drop in from\r\nVittoria, bringing news of the disaster. The King’s army had been\r\nrouted--his artillery abandoned: he had been pushed aside on to the\r\nPampeluna road, and Allied columns were coming up the great _chaussée_\r\nmaking for Bergara and Durango. On hearing these depressing news the\r\ncommandants of the forts which guarded the passes--those of Arlaban,\r\nMondragon, and Salinas--spiked their guns, and fell back without orders\r\nto join Foy at Bergara.\r\n\r\nThe news was only too true. On the night of the battle Wellington had\r\nissued orders for Longa’s Division to set out at dawn on the 22nd to\r\nforce the passes, and, if possible, to overtake Maucune’s unwieldy\r\nconvoy. Giron was to follow, when his men, who had suffered dreadful\r\nfatigue in their forced march from Orduña, were capable of movement.\r\nAs the Galicians were terribly under-gunned--there appear to have\r\nbeen only six pieces with the 12,000 infantry--Wellington lent them\r\ntwo batteries from the British artillery reserve[645]. Giron started\r\nfrom the neighbourhood of Vittoria at 3 o’clock in the afternoon, and\r\nhad gone only some six miles when the news of Clausel’s raid was sent\r\nto him by Pakenham. The whole army halted and began to retrace its\r\nsteps, with the object of joining the 6th Division and fending off\r\nthis unexpected attack. But the return march had hardly begun when the\r\nmessage arrived that Clausel’s cavalry had retreated in haste, and that\r\nthere was no danger on the side of Vittoria. Giron therefore resumed\r\nhis original advance, but only reached Escoriaza, a hamlet half-way\r\nbetween Salinas and Mondragon after dark[646]. His troops were worn\r\nout, and had not received any regular rations that day.\r\n\r\nIt thus chanced that only Longa’s Division continued the advance along\r\nthe Bayonne _chaussée_ on the 22nd, and that all day the Cantabrians\r\nwere far ahead of, and quite out of touch with, the Army of Galicia.\r\nIt was with this small force alone that Foy had to deal. The French\r\nGeneral had been prepared for trouble by the ominous news that Maucune\r\nhad given him on the previous day, and conceived that it was his duty\r\nto hold the passes as long as was prudent, in order to gain time for\r\nthe convoy to get on its way, and for the garrison of Bilbao to come\r\nin from the right rear. Accordingly he was much vexed to find that the\r\nofficers commanding the Mondragon forts had evacuated them, and had\r\nfallen back on Bergara. He resolved to hold the defile if possible,\r\nand marched back toward it, taking with him the only two battalions of\r\nhis division which he had at hand[647], and the garrisons of the three\r\nforts.\r\n\r\nThe fort of Mondragon was found empty--there were no enemies visible\r\nsave some local guerilleros who fled. But on advancing a little\r\nfarther, Foy came on the head of Longa’s column, descending from\r\nthe defile of Salinas. He spent the whole afternoon in a series of\r\nrearguard actions, making his men fall back by alternate battalions,\r\nand defending each turn of the road. The French troops behaved with\r\ngreat steadiness, and Longa was cautious, having received false news\r\nthat the Bilbao garrison had joined Foy. He contented himself with\r\nturning each successive position that the enemy took up, and at\r\nnightfall had only got about two miles beyond Mondragon. Here he\r\nhalted, having occupied the fort (where he found six spiked guns) and\r\ntaken 53 prisoners. Foy had lost about 200 men in all in the long\r\nbickering, and had been himself slightly wounded in the shoulder,\r\nthough he was not disabled: the Spaniards probably somewhat less[648].\r\n\r\nDuring the evening hours three more battalions of Foy’s own division\r\narrived at Bergara, but the garrison of Bilbao and St. Pol’s Italians\r\nhad not yet been heard of. Having now 3,000 men in hand, the French\r\ngeneral resolved to hold Longa up, until the missing troops should have\r\npassed behind him and got into a safe position. He waited opposite the\r\nCantabrians all the morning, but was not attacked: a reconnaissance\r\nsent out reported that the enemy was quiescent at Mondragon. The fact\r\nwas that Longa had heard that the French had received reinforcements,\r\nand was waiting for Giron to come up with the three Galician divisions.\r\nThey arrived by noon, much fatigued and drenched by heavy rain, and\r\nGiron contented himself with making arrangements for an attack on\r\nBergara on the next morning.\r\n\r\nBut this attack was never delivered, for Foy having at last picked up\r\nthe missing brigades, retreated on Villareal during the afternoon,\r\nusing St. Pol’s Italians as his rearguard. He says in his dispatch that\r\nhe had deduced from Longa’s strange quiescence the idea (quite correct\r\nin itself) that the Spaniards were refraining from pushing him, because\r\nthey were hoping that he would linger long enough at Bergara to be cut\r\noff by some other column, coming from Salvatierra on to Tolosa far\r\nin his rear. And Graham’s force had actually been detached for this\r\nvery purpose that afternoon--but Giron did not know it, and was really\r\ndetained only by the exhaustion of his troops. It was not till evening\r\nthat he got a dispatch from Wellington directing him to press hard\r\nupon Foy and delay his march, because an Anglo-Portuguese force was\r\nmoving by the Puerto de San Adrian to intercept his retreat[649]. But\r\nFoy, having guessed what plans might be brewing for his discomfiture,\r\nhad not only retreated betimes, but ordered Maucune, who was now a\r\nday’s march in front of him with the convoy, to drop the impedimenta\r\nand bring all his fighting force back to Villafranca, to block the\r\nroad from Salvatierra until he and his 8,000 men should have got past\r\nthe point of danger. This order Maucune executed on the morning of the\r\n24th, turning the convoy into Tolosa, and turning back to hold the\r\njunction of the roads, with one of his brigades in Villafranca town,\r\nand the other thrown forward across to the river Oria to Olaverria and\r\nBeassayn on the south bank. News had by this time come to hand that\r\nthe march of a British column from Salvatierra across the hills had\r\nbeen verified, and that the peril was a real one. Wherefore Foy pressed\r\nhis retreat, and sent Maucune orders to hold on at all costs till the\r\ncolumn from Bergara should have passed his rear.\r\n\r\nNow Wellington’s orders to Graham to cut in by the Puerto de San Adrian\r\nwith the 1st Division, Pack’s and Bradford’s Portuguese, and Anson’s\r\nLight Dragoons, had been issued late on the 22nd, but had only reached\r\nthe General and the greater part of his troops on the morning of the\r\n23rd. Of all the column only the two Light Battalions of the King’s\r\nGerman Legion and Bradford’s Portuguese had turned off that night.\r\nConsequently on the 23rd, the critical day, Graham and the bulk of his\r\ncommand were toiling up the pass in heavy rain, and had not crossed\r\nthe watershed, only Bradford and the two German battalions having\r\nreached the village of Segura. It was not till dawn on the 24th that\r\nAnson’s cavalry and Pack’s Portuguese got to the front; the rest of\r\nthe infantry was still far off. Graham then advanced on Villafranca,\r\nand soon came into collision with Maucune, who was already in position\r\ncovering the cross-roads. The head of Foy’s column, coming in from the\r\nWest, was clearly visible on the other side of the Oria in the act of\r\npassing behind the screen formed by Maucune’s covering force. He had\r\nstarted from Villareal before dawn, and got clear away before Longa and\r\nGiron were on the move, or able to delay him.\r\n\r\nGraham attacked at once, in the hope of driving in Maucune before\r\nFoy could get past. Bradford’s Portuguese, endeavouring to turn the\r\nFrench flank, pushed to the right; Halkett’s Germans, supported by the\r\ngrenadier and light companies of Pack’s brigade, made for Beassayn on\r\nthe left wing. Bradford’s leading unit, the 5th Caçadores, attacking\r\nrecklessly on unexplored ground, was thrown back at its first assault;\r\nbut the Brigadier, extending other battalions farther to his right,\r\nended by taking the village of Olaverria and pushing his immediate\r\nopponents across the river. The German light battalions carried\r\nBeassayn at their first rush. But Maucune, retiring to a new position\r\non high ground immediately above Villafranca, continued his resistance,\r\ntrying to gain time at all risks. In this he was successful: Foy,\r\nhurrying past his rear, got well forward on the Tolosa road with his\r\ntwo leading brigades--the other two he dropped behind the town, to\r\nsupport Maucune or relieve him when he should be driven in.\r\n\r\nOwing to the early hour--three in the morning--at which Foy had started\r\non his retreat from Villareal, the bulk of Giron’s army was never able\r\nto catch him up. Only Longa’s Cantabrians, leading the advance as\r\nusual, came into contact with his rear brigade--St. Pol’s Italians--at\r\nthe defile of La Descarga west of Villafranca. Failing to force a\r\npassage by a frontal attack, Longa turned the position; but the delay\r\npermitted St. Pol to get off with small loss and to catch up the rest\r\nof Foy’s column.\r\n\r\nBy three in the afternoon Graham was beginning to outflank Maucune’s\r\nline about Villafranca, with Bradford’s brigade on his right and\r\nPack’s on his left, while Longa had come in sight upon the _chaussée_.\r\nThereupon the French General, having held his ground for the necessary\r\nspace of time, made a prompt retreat along the Tolosa road, pursued but\r\nnot much harmed by the Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThis ended a rather unsatisfactory day--the French had lost more men\r\nthan the Allies[650], but the trap to catch them had failed completely.\r\nIt is clear that if Graham’s column could have crossed the Puerto de\r\nSan Adrian twelve hours earlier, or if Giron had pressed Foy hard and\r\ndelayed his movements either on the 23rd or on the 24th, the scheme\r\nwould have worked. Bad staff work was apparently responsible in some\r\nmeasure for both of these failures, though the extreme inclemency of\r\nthe weather was a secondary cause. Foy’s conduct of the operations on\r\nthe 22nd-23rd appears a little rash--he might have been caught but for\r\nhis good luck. But till he had picked up the troops from Bilbao, at\r\nnoon on the 23rd, he was constrained to wait at Bergara; and after he\r\nhad once received them he marched hard, and so escaped, thanks to his\r\nwise precaution in sending Maucune to Villafranca.\r\n\r\nAfter the combat of the morning Graham moved forward a few miles as\r\nfar as Ichasondo and neighbouring villages on the Tolosa road, while\r\nGiron came up in the evening, and billeted his army in Villafranca,\r\nBeassayn, and other places on the Oria. As the missing brigades of\r\nthe 1st Division appeared that night, there were now some 10,000\r\nAnglo-Portuguese[651] and 16,000 Spaniards[652] massed along the\r\n_chaussée_; Foy, having picked up the garrisons of Tolosa and some\r\nsmaller places, and having been joined by a stray brigade from the Army\r\nof the North, had also as many as 16,000 men in hand[653], so that the\r\nopposing forces on both sides had swollen to a considerable strength.\r\n\r\nGraham having failed (through no fault of his own) to intercept the\r\nenemy’s retreat at Villafranca, and regarding extreme haste as no\r\nlonger necessary, since the scheme had miscarried, set himself to\r\ncarry out Wellington’s orders to drive back the enemy to the Bidassoa\r\nwithout any great hurry. He was much hampered by the fact that Giron’s\r\narmy had outmarched its train, and was therefore suffering for want of\r\nsupplies, which could not be procured in the mountains of Guipuzcoa.\r\nOn the 25th he brought the whole of the allied forces up to Alegria,\r\nhalf-way to Tolosa, driving out Maucune’s division, which Foy had left\r\nthere as a rearguard. It was then discovered that the enemy had taken\r\nup a long and extensive position on each side of Tolosa, and showed no\r\ndisposition to give ground. It was clear that he must be driven off by\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nFoy, as he explains in his dispatch of June 28th[654], had resolved\r\nto make a stand at the junction of roads in Tolosa, because he was\r\nobsessed by a theory (less accurate than that which he had formed as to\r\nGraham’s march two days before) to the effect that King Joseph might\r\nhave dispatched part or the whole of his army, by the road which leads\r\nfrom Yrurzun on the Araquil to Tolosa across the mountains, in order to\r\ntransfer it to the lower Bidassoa and the Bayonne road. He was still\r\nignorant of the full effects of the battle of Vittoria, and having\r\nheard cannonading far to the south-west on the 23rd[655] had jumped to\r\nthe conclusion that the main army might be moving up to join him at\r\nTolosa. As a matter of fact King Joseph _had_ turned a detachment off\r\nthe Pampeluna road at Yrurzun--Reille’s two divisions--but they had\r\nbeen sent not by the more westerly road to Tolosa, but by the Col de\r\nVelate route to Santesteban, on which they travelled fast because they\r\nhad no guns or transport.\r\n\r\nBut to cover the imaginary movement Foy disposed his troops in front\r\nof the junction of roads. Tolosa town lies in a narrow defile, through\r\nwhich pass the Oria river and the great _chaussée_. It had been\r\nprepared long before for serious defence, as it was one of the chief\r\nhalting-places on the great road from Bayonne to Madrid. The old walls\r\nhad been strengthened with blockhouses, the gates were palisaded\r\noutside and had guns mounted by them. The town blocks the defile\r\ncompletely, but is commanded by steep hills on either side.\r\n\r\nFoy sent on the great convoy which Maucune had escorted, under charge\r\nof four battalions commanded by General Berlier. The rest of his troops\r\nhe disposed for defence. De Conchy’s brigade held the fortified town.\r\nOn the south-east Bonté’s brigade and St. Pol’s Italians were placed\r\non the heights above the Lizarza torrent, a forward position in which\r\nthey protected the Pampeluna road. The second brigade of Foy’s own\r\ndivision was placed on the hill of Jagoz, on the same flank but nearer\r\nthe town. On the other or western bank of the Oria Rouget’s brigade\r\n(the troops from Bilbao) were on commanding ground, flanking the town\r\nand blocking two mountain paths which came down on to it from Azpeytia\r\nin the valley of the Uroli. Maucune’s division was in reserve behind\r\nTolosa, massed on the _chaussée_. As Foy very truly observes in his\r\ndispatch, the position was strong against frontal attack, and could\r\nonly be turned by very wide détours by any troops arriving from the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThis was as evident to Graham as to Foy, and the British General\r\nprepared for a long day’s work. His intention was to outflank the\r\nposition, even though it should take many hours. In the centre the\r\nbulk of the 1st Division, followed by Pack’s Portuguese and Giron’s\r\nGalicians, advanced up the _chaussée_ on the left bank of the river\r\nOria, and halted a considerable distance from Tolosa. But Longa’s\r\nCantabrians and Porlier’s small Asturian division were sent off to make\r\na very circuitous march over the mountains on the right by Alzo and\r\nGastolu with the object of cutting into the Pampeluna road many miles\r\neast of Tolosa, and then taking the town in the rear. A less wide curve\r\nwas made by a column consisting of Bradford’s Portuguese brigade, with\r\nthe three Line-battalions of the King’s German Legion in support, who\r\nwere also to operate to the east of the _chaussée_ and of the river\r\nOria, and were directed to cross the Lizarza ravine and carry the hill\r\nbehind it, from whence they were to push forward to the Pampeluna road\r\nand then turn inwards against the town. A smaller column, consisting\r\nof one battalion of Pack’s brigade and the light companies of Giron’s\r\n3rd Division, was to make a corresponding movement to the west, and to\r\nendeavour to get on to the hill dominating Tolosa on that side. Nor\r\nwas this all: information came to hand that Mendizabal had brought to\r\nAspeytia what remained of the Biscayan irregulars whom Foy had routed\r\nand dispersed a month back[656]. Graham wrote to beg him to demonstrate\r\nwith these bands against the Bayonne _chaussée_ north of Tolosa, and\r\nto get on to that road if possible and block it.\r\n\r\nThe main column halted while the flanking operations were pursuing\r\ntheir slow course. The only fighting which took place in the morning\r\nwas an attack by Bradford’s brigade on the heights occupied by Bonté,\r\nopposite Aleon and beyond the Lizarza torrent. The French Brigadier\r\nhad neglected to guard the passages of the ravine, and allowed the\r\nPortuguese to get on to the ridge of his position without much\r\ndifficulty[657]. He then counter-attacked them, first with his own\r\nbrigade, then with St. Pol’s Italians also, but was unable to cast them\r\ndown from the hill: nor could Bradford get forward. All the hours of\r\nthe early afternoon were spent in an indecisive _tiraillade_ on this\r\nfront. It is curious to note that both the commanders-in-chief write in\r\nsharp criticism of their subordinates: Foy says that Bonté was careless\r\nand disobeyed orders; Graham that Bradford’s men, after a good start,\r\nfought in a confused and disorderly fashion[658]. On the other flank\r\nthe Spanish-Portuguese detachment, sent to try to gain a footing on the\r\nhills to the west of Tolosa, reported that they had come up against an\r\nabsolute precipice, and could do nothing.\r\n\r\nSo matters wore on till about six o’clock in the afternoon, when\r\ndistant firing in the rear of the French position announced that both\r\nLonga on the right and Mendizabal on the left were in touch with\r\nthe enemy. Graham then ordered a general attack, the three German\r\nLine-battalions, hitherto in reserve behind Bradford, being ordered\r\nto strike at the Pampeluna road; meanwhile the main column, which\r\nhad so long waited opposite Tolosa, deployed the two light German\r\nbattalions in its front, with the Guards Brigade and Giron’s 3rd\r\nDivision supporting, and advanced against the south face of the town.\r\nThe detachment to the extreme left, which had failed to get up the\r\nprecipices in its front, was directed to turn inward to attack the west\r\nside of Tolosa.\r\n\r\nThese orders brought on very heavy fighting, for Foy had held his\r\nforward positions so long that he had great difficulty in withdrawing\r\nhis troops from them, when he found that he was outflanked, and\r\neven attacked in the rear. At the south end of the field, along the\r\n_chaussée_, the allied attack failed entirely, the strength of the\r\nfortifications of the town having been under-estimated. When the\r\nleading battalion (1st Light Battalion K.G.L.) approached the gate,\r\nit came into a cross-fire from the blockhouses, and still heavier\r\nfrontal musketry from the well-lined ramparts, which proved wholly\r\ninaccessible. Scaling ladders would have been required to mount them.\r\nThe line broke, but the men did not retire, but threw themselves down\r\nbehind walls and in ditches and tried to answer the fire from such\r\ncover as they could find. Many took refuge in the courtyard of a\r\nconvent not far outside the Vittoria gate, from which their colonel,\r\nOmpteda, led out a second assault, which melted away under the fire\r\nas the first had done. In truth, the attempt was a misjudged one\r\non Graham’s part--possibly his bad eyesight had failed to note the\r\nstrength of the defences. The 1st Light Battalion lost five officers\r\nand 58 men killed and wounded in a quarter of an hour[659], and had to\r\nkeep under shelter as best it could; the supporting troops were halted\r\nand ordered to lie down, while guns were brought up from the rear to\r\nbatter the gate. This should obviously have been done before, and not\r\nafter, the assault. The check was unnecessary, as was shown a little\r\nlater when the artillery smashed the gate by a few shots, and cleared\r\nthe neighbouring walls.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there had been fierce fighting on the eastern side\r\nof the town, where Bradford’s Portuguese, and the three German\r\nline-battalions, with Longa’s men on their northern flank, had fallen\r\nupon the three French brigades lying outside the town. Bonté’s and St.\r\nPol’s battalions, still frontally engaged against Bradford, suddenly\r\nrealized the danger of their position, when the Germans attacked their\r\nleft flank, and Longa appeared almost in their rear. They retreated\r\nin haste towards Tolosa, and got jammed outside the Pampeluna gate,\r\nwhich had been blocked for defence and could not readily be entered.\r\nTo avoid being crushed against the walls, they massed themselves for\r\na counter-stroke, and thrusting back the Germans for a moment, raced\r\nalong the river-bank, past the foot of the ramparts, till they got\r\nunder the cover of Foy’s second brigade on the hill of Jagoz, and\r\nescaped beyond the north end of the town. The Germans, though in\r\ngreat disorder, made an attack on the Pampeluna gate, which failed\r\nfor the same reason that had wrecked that on the Vittoria gate--the\r\nimpossibility of escalading a well-defended rampart.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was heavy skirmishing going on to the north-west of\r\nTolosa: Mendizabal’s bands had appeared on the mountain road from\r\nAspeytia, and had engaged Rouget’s brigade, which was covering Foy’s\r\nright flank. The French general’s dispatch confesses that the troops\r\nfrom the Bilbao garrison, which included some conscript battalions\r\nfrom the Bayonne reserve, behaved badly, lost ground, and had to be\r\nrallied by their general’s personal exertions. They were apparently\r\nthrown into a panic by an attack delivered on their flank, by the small\r\nSpanish-Portuguese detachment which Graham had sent out on his left: it\r\nhad worked up by the narrow space between the walls of Tolosa and the\r\nprecipice above, and came up very opportunely to aid Mendizabal. Rouget\r\nheld on till dark, but with difficulty, and the knowledge that his\r\nroute of retreat was threatened added to Foy’s anxiety, for Longa was\r\nalso pushing behind the town on the other side. Accordingly he ordered\r\nDeconchy’s brigade to evacuate Tolosa at once, just as the sun was\r\nsetting, and prepared for a general retreat.\r\n\r\nIf the order had been given half an hour later, the garrison of Tolosa\r\nwould probably have been captured whole, for Graham’s guns had just\r\nblown the defences of the Vittoria gate to pieces, and the German\r\nlight battalions burst in with ease at the point where they had been\r\nchecked before. There was some confused fighting in the streets, but\r\nthe French got off with no great loss under cover of the darkness, and\r\nfell in with the rear of their main column, which went off down the\r\n_chaussée_ at great speed. Mendizabal made some prisoners from Rouget’s\r\nbrigade, as it fell back to join the rest across the slopes, and Longa\r\ncaught some fugitives on the other flank[660].\r\n\r\nFoy says that he lost some 400 men in the fight, which would seem a\r\nlow estimate, as the Allies could show 200 prisoners, and Bonté’s\r\nand Rouget’s brigades had been very roughly handled. Graham reports\r\n58 killed, 316 wounded, and 45 missing--the last all from Bradford’s\r\nbrigade. Of the Spaniards Longa and Mendizabal only were engaged:\r\nGiron’s report (as so often occurs with Spanish documents) gives no\r\nfigures, only remarking that some of Longa’s 1st battalion of Iberia\r\n‘perished by reason of their rash courage, but had a great share in\r\ndeciding the day’--presumably by pushing far ahead in the turning\r\nmovement which caused Foy to order a general retreat. If we allow 200\r\nSpanish killed and wounded, we shall probably not be far out of our\r\nreckoning. Had Graham withheld his unlucky assault on the Vittoria gate\r\ntill it had been well battered, and trusted entirely to his turning\r\nmovements, he would have got off with a much smaller casualty list. His\r\noriginal design of manœuvring Foy out of Tolosa was the right game,\r\nconsidering the strength of the position. The French general could\r\nplead in defence of his risky tactics that he had held up a superior\r\nforce for a whole day--but at that particular moment time did not\r\nhappen to matter--as Graham’s leisurely pursuit on the subsequent days\r\nsufficiently shows. He was only set on getting Foy across the Bidassoa;\r\nand nothing in the general course of the campaign depended on whether\r\nhe did so a day sooner or a day later. On the other hand, by standing\r\ntoo long at Tolosa Foy nearly lost three brigades, and might indeed\r\nhave lost his whole force.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this side-campaign displays none of the interest\r\nof its four first days. Foy retired to Andoain on the night of the\r\ncombat of Tolosa, where he was joined by the battalions of the\r\n40th and 101st under General Berlier, which had escorted Maucune’s\r\nconvoy to the frontier, and by the 62nd and a Spanish ‘Juramentado’\r\nregiment withdrawn from Biscay garrisons. This, despite of his recent\r\nlosses, gave him a force of 16,000 infantry, 400 sabres, and 10 guns.\r\nGraham did not press him, his troops being much fatigued: only the\r\nindefatigable Longa appeared with his Cantabrians in front of the\r\nposition. On the 27th the whole French force retired unmolested to\r\nHernani.\r\n\r\nIt was of course all-important to Foy to know what were the situation\r\nand intentions of the King. Nothing could be heard of the main army at\r\nAndoain or Hernani, so he detached Berlier’s brigade to seek for news\r\nin the Bastan, along the upper Bidassoa. On the 28th Berlier discovered\r\nReille and two divisions of the Army of Portugal at Vera. They were in\r\nbad order, without guns and much under strength, though stragglers were\r\nrejoining in considerable numbers. Reille had been as ignorant of Foy’s\r\nwhereabouts as Foy had been of that of the main army. He was rejoiced\r\nto hear that all the Biscay garrisons had been saved, and that there\r\nwas a solid force ready to co-operate with him in the defence of the\r\nline of the Bidassoa. His own troops were not yet fit for fighting.\r\nAccordingly he sent Foy orders to evacuate Hernani and come back to\r\nthe frontier, though he need not actually cross the Bidassoa unless\r\nhe were compelled to do so. By stopping at Oyarzun he could keep up\r\ncommunication with St. Sebastian, which must be needing attention.\r\n\r\nThe condition of that fortress, indeed, had already been troubling the\r\nmind of Foy on his last day of independent command. It lay so near the\r\nFrench border, and had been for years so far from any enemy--Guipuzcoan\r\nguerrilleros excepted--that it had been much neglected. When General\r\nRey, named as Governor by King Joseph two days before the battle of\r\nVittoria, arrived with orders to put it in a state of defence, he\r\nfound it garrisoned only by 500 gendarmes, a battalion of recruits on\r\nthe way to join the 120th Line, and two weak companies of pioneers\r\nand sappers--1,200 men in all. The stores of food were low, the\r\nglacis was cumbered with huts and sheds, there was no provision of\r\ngabions, fascines, or timber. Moreover, the town was full of Spanish\r\nand French fugitives who had preceded the King on his retreat--there\r\nwere (it is said) as many as 7,000 of them, lingering in Spain till\r\nthe last moment, in the hope that Wellington might be stopped on the\r\nEbro. The news of Vittoria arrived on the 23rd, and caused hopeless\r\nconsternation--the place was not ready to stand a siege--the garrison\r\nso small that it could not even spare a battalion to escort the\r\ntiresome mass of refugees to Bayonne. Rey began in feverish haste to\r\nclear the glacis, palisade the outworks, and rearrange the cannons\r\non the walls, but he had too few hands for work, and was in a state\r\nresembling despair when on the 28th Foy turned up for a flying visit,\r\nsaw and acknowledged the nakedness of the land, and promised to do all\r\nthat he could to help--though it was less than the Governor required.\r\nHe took away the old garrison--the recruits were not too trustworthy,\r\nthe gendarmes not siege troops: to replace them he threw in the whole\r\nof Deconchy’s brigade--four battalions, about 2,000 infantry--and all\r\nthe gunners that he could spare. As the garrison of Guetaria, 450\r\nstrong, escaped by sea to San Sebastian two days later, and a number\r\nof stragglers dropped into the place before the siege began, the gross\r\ntotal of the garrison was raised to some 3,000 men. Rey asked for\r\n4,000, but Foy would not grant him another battalion--and was justified\r\nby the course of the siege, for the place was very small and, if it\r\ncould be held at all, was defensible by the lesser number. The only\r\ndoubt was whether there would be time to get it in order before the\r\nAllies appeared[661]. But perhaps the best service that Foy did for Rey\r\nwas that he removed, at two hours’ notice, the whole mass of refugees.\r\nThey marched, much lamenting, for Bayonne, under the escort of the old\r\noutgoing garrison. On the 29th Reille ordered Foy to evacuate Oyarzun\r\nand fall back to the Bidassoa, and before he had been gone three hours\r\nMendizabal’s Guipuzcoan irregulars, 3,000 strong, appeared in front\r\nof the fortress and cut its communication with France. They were an\r\nunorganized band, without artillery, but effective enough for stopping\r\nthe highway.\r\n\r\nGraham, seeing that the French had escaped him, and had a clear retreat\r\nto the frontier, had made no serious attempt to press them. He was\r\nquite content that they should go at their own pace, and was determined\r\nnot to harass the 1st Division, who, as he wrote to Wellington, were in\r\na state of great exhaustion. To have hurried Foy out of Spain two days\r\nearlier would have cost men, and would have had no beneficial effect\r\non the general course of the campaign; for Wellington and the main\r\narmy were far away in Navarre, and if Graham had reached the Bidassoa\r\non the 26th or 28th, with his own and Giron’s 25,000 men, they could\r\nhave done nothing, since they had in front of them the fortress of\r\nBayonne, with Foy’s 16,000 men, the 7,000 whom Reille had brought up\r\nfrom Santesteban, and the remains of the general reserve--for though\r\nRouget’s battalions and other detachments had been lent from Bayonne\r\nalready, there were still a few thousand men in hand. In all, Reille\r\nwould have had an army as large as Graham’s own, and though some of\r\nit was rather demoralized, the fortress, and the strong positions in\r\nfront of it along the Bidassoa, Nive, and Nivelle, counterbalanced\r\nthis disadvantage. If Wellington had chosen to march on Bayonne with\r\nhis main body, the day after Vittoria, the problem would have been a\r\nvery different one. But since he had preferred to move in pursuit first\r\nof King Joseph and then of Clausel, there was nothing more which the\r\ncommander of a detached corps like that of Graham could accomplish.\r\nHe did all that his chief required of him, when he pushed Foy out of\r\nSpain and laid siege to St. Sebastian. That the project for cutting off\r\nthe French detachments at Villafranca came to nothing was no fault of\r\nGraham’s--being due partly to bad staff-work at Head-Quarters, partly\r\nto the chances of rough weather, and partly to Foy’s laudable caution\r\nand celerity.\r\n\r\nThe side-show in Guipuzcoa came to a tame end twenty-four hours after\r\nthe blockade of St. Sebastian had been formed. On the 30th Reille\r\nordered all the troops on the south bank of the lower Bidassoa to\r\nretire into France. Foy’s and Maucune’s divisions crossed the bridge\r\nof Behobie, under the protection of four battalions of the Bayonne\r\nreserve, which remained on the heights by the hermitage of St. Marcial,\r\nand marched to Urogne and other villages down-stream. Lamartinière’s\r\ndivision remained at Vera, Fririon’s (late Sarrut’s) at Hendaye.\r\n\r\nLate on the same afternoon the advance-guard of Graham’s army came\r\nin sight of the Bidassoa--it consisted as usual of Longa’s untiring\r\nCantabrians only, the 1st Division and the Portuguese having been\r\nhalted near St. Sebastian, the bulk of the Galicians at Hernani and\r\nRenteria. Longa, keeping to the coast, surprised and captured the\r\nFrench garrison of Passages (150 men), which was too late in obeying\r\nReille’s order to retreat on France while the bridge of Behobie was\r\nstill available. He then came in contact with the covering force on\r\nthe heights of San Marcial[662], which was at the same time menaced by\r\nCastañon with a brigade of the 4th Galician Division, who had come up\r\nthe high road from Renteria.\r\n\r\nThe French brigadier evacuated the position at once. Reille had told\r\nhim that he was only placed there to protect the retreat of Foy. He\r\ncrossed the Bidassoa, leaving only a detachment of sixty men in the\r\n_tête de pont_ which covered the south or Spanish end of the bridge of\r\nBehobie; it consisted of a stone blockhouse surrounded with palisades.\r\nThe further or French end of the long bridge was blocked by the\r\nfortified village of Hendaye.\r\n\r\nNext morning Graham resolved that the _tête de pont_ must be taken\r\nor destroyed, so that the enemy should have no open road by which he\r\nmight return to Spain. While some Spanish infantry exchanged a vague\r\nfusillade across the river with the French in Hendaye, ten guns[663]\r\nwere turned on the blockhouse. The garrison tried to blow it up and to\r\nretreat, but their mine failed, their commanding-officer was killed,\r\nand they were about to surrender when Foy sent two fresh companies\r\nover the bridge to bring them off. This was done, at the cost of four\r\nofficers and 64 men, killed and wounded while crossing the much-exposed\r\nbridge. Foy then ordered the structure to be set on fire; and as its\r\nfloor was composed of wood this was easily done: the four arches\r\nnearest France were burnt out by the following morning (July 1).\r\n\r\nThis evacuation, without any attempt at defence, of the bridgehead\r\non the Bidassoa angered the Minister of War at Paris, and still\r\nmore Napoleon, when the news reached him at Wittenberg nine days\r\nlater. Foy and Reille had men enough to have held the heights of San\r\nMarcial, against anything short of an attack by the whole of Graham’s\r\nand Giron’s infantry. And it is certain that Graham would not have\r\ndelivered any such assault, but would have halted in front of them,\r\nand waited for orders from Wellington. The Emperor, who--as we shall\r\npresently see--was set on a counter-offensive from the moment when the\r\nnews of Vittoria reached him, was wild with wrath at the abandonment of\r\nthe foothold in Spain. ‘It was insane,’ he wrote to Clarke, ‘to recross\r\nthe Bidassoa: they all show themselves as timid as women[664].’\r\n\r\nBut whether it would have been possible for the French to hold the\r\nIrun-Behobie-San Marcial _tête de pont_, when Wellington had come up\r\nin person from the south, is another matter. Probably he would have\r\ndecided that the enemy must be thrust back across the Bidassoa, before\r\nhe dared to sit down to beleaguer San Sebastian. And undoubtedly he\r\nhad men enough to carry out that operation. But this was no excuse for\r\nReille’s evacuation of the position, one of the highest strategical\r\nvalue, before he was compelled to do so by force. The fact was that\r\nReille, like most of the other French generals, was demoralized at the\r\nmoment by the recent disaster of Vittoria, and had lost confidence both\r\nin himself and in his troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE EAST COAST. MURRAY AT TARRAGONA\r\n\r\n[N.B.--FOR MAP OF CATALONIA AND PLAN OF TARRAGONA SEE VOL. IV, PP. 538\r\nAND 524]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are certain episodes of the Peninsular War which the British\r\nhistorian has to narrate with a feeling of some humiliation, but\r\nwhich have to be set forth in full detail, if only for the purpose of\r\nillustrating the manifold difficulties with which Wellington had to\r\ncope. Of these by far the most distressing is the story of General Sir\r\nJohn Murray at Tarragona.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that a diversion on the East Coast formed an\r\nessential part of Wellington’s great scheme for the expulsion of the\r\nFrench from Spain, and that he had devoted much care to instructing\r\nMurray in the manner in which it was to be carried out. If sufficient\r\nshipping to embark 10,000 men could be procured at Alicante, the bulk\r\nof the Anglo-Sicilian army was to be transported to Catalonia, and to\r\nstrike at Tarragona, getting what aid it could from the local Spanish\r\nforces under the Captain-General Copons. If, as was to be expected,\r\nSuchet should fly northward from Valencia with all his available\r\nfield-army, to rescue Tarragona, the two Spanish units in the kingdom\r\nof Murcia, Elio’s and Del Parque’s armies, were to take the offensive\r\nagainst the detachments which the French Marshal would have to leave\r\nbehind him to hold down his southern conquests. Murray might fail in\r\nCatalonia, if Suchet were rapid and lucky in his combinations; but in\r\nthat case Elio and Del Parque ought to get possession of the city of\r\nValencia and all its fertile plainland. Or, on the other hand, Suchet\r\nmight be loth to abandon his advanced position, might hold it in force,\r\nand might order Decaen and the Army of Catalonia to make head against\r\nthe Anglo-Sicilian expeditionary force. If this should happen, the\r\nSpanish generals might be held in check, but Murray would have a free\r\nhand at Tarragona. With the aid of Copons he ought to be able to take\r\nthe place, and to throw all the French occupation of Catalonia into\r\ndisorder. In the end, Suchet would have to evacuate Valencia, in order\r\nto save Decaen and the Catalan garrisons. At the worst the expedition\r\nof the Anglo-Sicilian army ought at least to have the effect of giving\r\nSuchet so much to think about, that he would have no attention to spare\r\nfor the perils of King Joseph and the fate of Castile.\r\n\r\nThis last minimum result was all that was achieved. Suchet, it is true,\r\nhad an anxious time during the critical days of Wellington’s march\r\nto Vittoria, and sent no help to the King. But neither was Tarragona\r\ntaken by the Anglo-Sicilians, nor Valencia by the armies of Elio and\r\nDel Parque. Both of those forces endured humiliating checks, from an\r\nenemy over whom they had every strategical advantage. And the story\r\nof Murray’s operations about Tarragona is not the story of an honest\r\nand excusable failure, but one which provokes bitter irritation over\r\nthe doings of a British general who showed himself not only timid and\r\nincompetent, but shifty, mendacious, and treacherous to his allies.\r\nThere is nothing in the whole history of the Peninsular War which\r\nproduces such an unpleasant impression as the facts revealed by the\r\nminutes of Murray’s court-martial, supplemented by certain documents\r\nwhich ought to have been forthcoming at that trial, but unfortunately\r\nwere not.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed to the details of this unhappy campaign. In obedience\r\nto Wellington’s orders, Murray began to draw his army in to Alicante\r\nbetween the 25th and 27th of May, the forward positions which the\r\nAnglo-Sicilians had held being handed over to Elio’s troops, while\r\nthose of Del Parque, who had at last been brought up from the borders\r\nof Andalusia, took post on Elio’s left, about Yecla and Chinchilla.\r\nBoth these armies were to move forward, as soon as Suchet should be\r\ndetected in the act of detaching divisions northward to deal with\r\nMurray’s oncoming invasion. The appearance of the Spaniards on ground\r\nhitherto held by British outposts gave the Marshal warning that some\r\nnew plan was developing. A raid by sea was an obvious possibility, but\r\nhe could not tell whether it might not be directed on a point as far\r\nsouth as Valencia or as far north as Rosas. Till Murray showed his\r\nhand only precautionary movements could be made. Suchet was at this\r\nmoment stronger than he had been at the time of the battle of Castalla.\r\nWarned of his danger by the results of that fight, he had strengthened\r\nhis troops on the littoral at the expense of the garrisons inland.\r\nSeveroli’s Italian division had been ordered down from Saragossa to\r\nValencia[665]. This heavy draft on the northern section of his army was\r\nrendered possible by the fact that Clausel had come far forward into\r\nAragon in pursuit of Mina, so that Saragossa and its region could be\r\nheld with smaller numbers than usual. The Spanish irregular forces in\r\nthis direction had full occupation found for them, by the raid of the\r\nArmy of Portugal into their sphere of operations. And this suited well\r\nwith Wellington’s general plan--the more that French troops were drawn\r\ndown to the Mediterranean, the less would there be of them available\r\nfor service in Castile, when his own blow came to be delivered.\r\n\r\nMurray had at his disposal in the harbour of Alicante transports\r\nsufficient to carry much more than the force of 10,000 men, which\r\nWellington had named as the minimum with which a raid on Catalonia\r\nmight be attempted. He was able to embark the whole of his own army,\r\nwith the exception of the regiment of Sicilian cavalry (he was short of\r\nhorse-transports), and in addition nearly the whole of Whittingham’s\r\nSpaniards--all indeed save one battalion[666] and the attached\r\nsquadrons. This made up a force of 14,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and\r\n800 artillery, with 24 field-guns and the battering train which had\r\nbeen sent round from Portugal. The British contingent was a little\r\nstronger than at the time of the battle of Castalla, for if one\r\nbattalion of the King’s German Legion had been sent back to Sicily\r\nsince that fight, Wellington had permitted Murray to draw in the\r\n2/67th, long in garrison at Cartagena, and had sent him a Portuguese\r\nand a British company of artillery to man his battering train[667].\r\nMoreover, two squadrons of Brunswick Hussars had arrived direct from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe whole force, having been swiftly embarked at Alicante, sailed on\r\nMay 31st; and being favoured with a strong south-west wind came in\r\nsight of the high-lying Tarragona on June 2nd. The fleet of transports\r\nran into the bay sheltered by Cape Salou, eight miles south of its\r\ngoal. There would have been no object in risking a more difficult\r\ndisembarkation on the long open beaches at the mouth of the Francoli\r\nriver, closer to Tarragona. Before landing his main body Murray shipped\r\noff two battalions (2/67th and De Roll-Dillon) under Colonel Prevost,\r\nto seize the defile of the Col de Balaguer, the point twenty miles to\r\nthe south of Tarragona where the coast-road from Tortosa curves round\r\na steep headland between a precipice and the sea. There was a small\r\nFrench fort, San Felipe de Balaguer, blocking the Col, and Prevost was\r\nordered to take it if he could. But its fall was not an absolutely\r\nessential condition to the success of the siege, for the road could be\r\ncut, blasted away, or blocked with entrenchments north of the fort, at\r\nseveral points where a thousand men could stop a whole army corps. It\r\nwas desirable to take this precaution, because the Col de Balaguer road\r\nwas the only route by which succours coming from Valencia could reach\r\nthe plain of Tarragona, without taking an immense détour inland, by\r\npaths impracticable for artillery.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the arrival of the British fleet off Cape Salou, General\r\nCopons, Captain-General of Catalonia, rode down from his head-quarters\r\nat Reus, ten miles away, to report to Murray that he had received\r\nWellington’s instructions, and had done his best to carry them out. The\r\nSpanish Army of Catalonia consisted of no more than 15,000 men, even\r\nafter it had received the two battalions which Wellington had sent to\r\nit by sea during the winter[668]. Over 5,500 of them were locked up\r\nin garrisons in the interior; many of these were untrained recruits,\r\nand none were available for the field. Of the remainder, Copons had\r\nbrought down twelve battalions to the neighbourhood of Tarragona,\r\nleaving only two under his second-in-command, Eroles, to watch the\r\nFrench garrisons in the north[669]. He had also with him his handful\r\nof cavalry--370 sabres; field-guns the army had none. Altogether there\r\nwere 7,000 men ready to join Murray at once: 1,500 more might be\r\nbrought in, if the French of the northern garrisons should move down\r\nto join General Decaen at Barcelona. Copons had certainly done all\r\nthat was in his power to aid Wellington’s scheme. Murray asked him to\r\nlend two battalions to join the brigade that was to strike at Fort San\r\nFelipe and to block the Col de Balaguer, and to arrange the rest so as\r\nto cover at a distance the disembarkation of the Anglo-Sicilian army.\r\nCopons consented, and on the next morning the whole force came ashore,\r\nPrevost’s brigade in a creek near the Col de Balaguer, where it found\r\nthe two Spanish battalions already arrived, the rest of the army at\r\nSalou Bay. The expeditionary force was little cumbered with transport,\r\nand had but a small allowance of horses and mules: the infantry and\r\nsome of the field-guns with the greater part of the cavalry were ashore\r\nby the early afternoon, and marched that same night on Tarragona,\r\nwhich was invested from sea to sea, Mackenzie and Adam taking up their\r\nposition by the mouth of the Francoli, Clinton occupying the Olivo\r\nheights, and Whittingham extending down to the shore east of the city.\r\nThe French garrison kept quiet--being of no strength sufficient to\r\njustify the showing of a man outside the walls.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bertoletti had with him two battalions, one French and one\r\nItalian[670], a company of Juramentados, two companies of artillery,\r\nand the armed crews of three small vessels which were blockaded in the\r\nport--they were turned on to act as auxiliary gunners. The whole did\r\nnot exceed 1,600 men. This was an entirely inadequate force, and the\r\ndefences were in an unsatisfactory condition. After Suchet had captured\r\nthe city in 1811, he had no intention of leaving locked up behind him\r\na garrison of the size required for such a large fortress. The outer\r\nenceinte had been left in the condition of ruin consequent on the\r\nsiege[671], and only the Upper City on its high cliff was occupied.\r\nIts western front, where the breaches had been, was repaired; but the\r\nLower City and its fortifications remained practically untouched. All\r\nthat had been done was to patch up two isolated strong-points, the\r\nso-called Fort Royal and Bastion of St. Carlos. These had been cut off\r\nfrom the mass of the ruins, and closed in at the rear: each was armed\r\nwith one gun. The object of this was merely to prevent British ships\r\nfrom entering Tarragona roadstead and mooring there. These two outlying\r\nposts, dangerously remote from the city above, were held by no more\r\nthan a company each. Bertoletti thought for a moment of abandoning\r\nthem, since he dared not detach reinforcements from his inadequate\r\ngarrison, and his communication with the forts was across half a\r\nmile of exposed ground: nothing was more likely than that the enemy\r\nwould slip detachments among the ruined houses and walls of the Lower\r\nCity, and dig himself in between the Upper City and the weak outlying\r\nposts, which must inevitably fall. But reflecting on the advantage of\r\nkeeping the harbour unusable, he resolved to hold on to them till the\r\nlast minute. And his policy turned out to be justified, for had they\r\nbeen evacuated, even the torpid and timorous Murray could hardly have\r\navoided the temptation of closing in on the Upper City, which was in\r\nno condition to hold out for the space of nine days during which the\r\nAnglo-Sicilian army lay in front of it.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment of his landing Murray seems to have been obsessed\r\nwith the idea that every disposable French soldier in Catalonia\r\nand Valencia would be on his back within a very few days. As his\r\nevidence during his court martial shows, he had a notion that Suchet\r\nwould practically evacuate Valencia, and march against him with\r\nthree-quarters of his available men, while at the same time Decaen\r\nwould abandon all Catalonia save the largest towns and bring an even\r\ngreater force to Tarragona from the north. He had made elaborate,\r\nand in part correct, calculations as to the gross force of the two\r\nFrench armies, by which he made out that the enemy might conceivably\r\nconcentrate 25,000 men against him. For the fact that such a force\r\nwould have to be scraped together from very remote points, between\r\nwhich communication must be very difficult, he made insufficient\r\nallowance. Still less did he calculate out the handicap on the enemy\r\ncaused by the fact that Suchet and Decaen were out of touch with each\r\nother, and would obviously look upon the problem presented to them from\r\ndifferent points of view,--all the former’s action being influenced\r\nby his wish to hold on to Valencia, all the latter’s by his anxiety\r\nnot to have his communication with France cut off. Murray assumed that\r\nall roads marked on his map would be practicable to the enemy, that\r\nSuchet’s information would always be correct, that his troops would\r\nmarch every day the possible maximum, and that they would have no\r\ndifficulties concerned with food, water, or weather. Every conceivable\r\nhazard of war was to fall luckily for the enemy, unluckily for himself.\r\nAt his trial in 1814 he explained that he was never sanguine of\r\nsuccess, and that he did not expect when he sailed that he could take\r\nTarragona[672]. He chose to regard himself as the blind and unwilling\r\ninstrument of Wellington’s orders, which he would carry out, so far as\r\nhe could, with an expectation that they would lead to failure. And he\r\nobserved that the dominating motive which influenced all his doings\r\nwas that Wellington had written that ‘he would forgive everything\r\nexcepting that the corps should be beaten or dispersed’[673]. Deducing\r\nfrom this phrase the general policy that he must pursue, Murray came to\r\nthe conclusion ‘the first principle is the army’s safety’. He started\r\nintending to subordinate all chances of success to the remotest risk\r\nof defeat. His mind obsessed with this miserable prepossession, he\r\nwas, in fact, defeated before he had ever set sail. Yet he hid his\r\nresolve from his generals, even from the senior officer, Clinton, who\r\nwould have succeeded to the command if he had fallen sick or received a\r\nchance bullet. They all complained that he never gave them any hint of\r\nwhat were his intentions, or showed them Wellington’s orders which it\r\nwas his duty to carry out. ‘We were totally uninformed,’ said Clinton\r\nat the court martial, ‘of the instructions which the Commander of the\r\nforces might have for his guidance[674]. The first that we knew of\r\nthese instructions of the Commander of the forces, and then partially\r\nonly, was when he produced them at a Council of War on June 17th,’\r\nafter the siege of Tarragona was over. Clinton, Mackenzie, and Adam,\r\nthe three commanders of units, were all very confident in their men:\r\n‘they were in the highest state of discipline and equipment[675],’\r\nsaid Mackenzie, and spoiling for a fight. Hence their entire amazement\r\nas they discovered that Murray was intending to avoid all offensive\r\noperations: it even led to an infraction of discipline, when Mackenzie,\r\nAdam, and General Donkin[676] called together on their commander to\r\nurge on him a more active policy[677], and were chased out of the\r\nroom with the words ‘it will not do’--a decision which, as Mackenzie\r\nremarked, ‘was unanswerable’. For any further urging of the point would\r\nhave amounted to military disobedience. From the moment when the army\r\nlanded at Cape Salou on June 3rd, down to the day of its ignominious\r\nflight on June 12th, Murray was thinking of nothing but horrible\r\npossibilities--he was what the French call a _catastrophard_.\r\n\r\nProbably his most disastrous resolve of all was that which he came to\r\nwhen first he surveyed Tarragona, on the evening of his disembarkation.\r\nThough he noted the half-ruinous condition of the two outworks,\r\non which the enemy was working to the last moment, their isolated\r\nposition, and the fact that they were surrounded by all sorts of\r\ncover easily to be seized, he resolved to lay formal siege to them,\r\nas if they were the solid front of a regular line of defence. As\r\nNapier remarks with perfect good sense, they should have been dealt\r\nwith as Wellington dealt with the Redoute Renaud at Rodrigo, or Hill\r\nwith the forts of Almaraz, which were far more formidable works than\r\nthe Fuerte Real or San Carlos[678]. They should have been taken by\r\nforce, escaladed, on the night of the formation of the blockade.\r\nAnd being incomplete, ill-flanked, and without palisades or ditch,\r\nand under-manned, they undoubtedly could have been rushed. But\r\nMurray, instead of trying to gain time for the prompt attack on the\r\nmain fortress and its badly-stopped breaches, proceeded to lay out\r\napproaches and commence batteries on the low ground by the mouth of\r\nthe Francoli river, with the object of reducing the two outworks by\r\nregular operations. On June 4th one battery was commenced near the sea,\r\n600 yards from San Carlos, another farther inland, 900 yards from the\r\nFuerte Real. Their construction was covered by a naval bombardment:\r\nAdmiral Hallowell moved into the roadstead a brig, three bomb-vessels,\r\nand two gunboats, which shelled the Upper City freely, in order to\r\ndistract the attention of the garrison from the work on the batteries\r\nby the Francoli. The fire was kept up from dusk till dawn on the\r\n4th-5th, and repeated on the 6th-7th during the same hours--throughout\r\nthe day the workers in the trenches kept low. This bombardment had\r\nthe desired result of permitting the batteries to be finished without\r\nmolestation, but inflicted no great damage on the city, though it set\r\nfire to some houses, and caused casualties both among the garrison and\r\nthe inhabitants. But unaimed night-fire had of course no effect on the\r\nwalls of the enceinte.\r\n\r\nBy dawn on the 6th the two batteries were ready and opened on the\r\noutworks with six guns: they kept up the fire all day, and with some\r\neffect, suffering themselves very little from the distant counter-fire\r\nof the Upper City. At dark, according to the French narrative of the\r\ndefence, parties of skirmishers came out of the trenches, took cover\r\nin the ruins of the lower city and kept up a persistent _tiraillade_\r\nagainst the outworks[679]. It was expected that they would try to rush\r\nthem at some chosen hour--and this would undoubtedly have been the\r\nright policy. But nothing of the kind happened; the British parties\r\nwithdrew at dawn, and Bertoletti began to ask himself whether the whole\r\nof these feeble operations were not a mere demonstration, intended\r\nto draw the French armies of Valencia and Catalonia toward Tarragona,\r\nwhile the real blow was being delivered in some other quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring the second night of naval bombardment, that of the 6th-7th,\r\nMurray had ordered a third breaching battery to be built, near the\r\nbridge of the Francoli, 300 yards closer to the Fuerte Real than the\r\noriginal battery, No. 2. On the morning of the 7th all three batteries\r\nwere hard at work, and with good effect; the gorge of the Fuerte Real\r\nwas blown to bits by flank fire from the new battery, its one gun\r\nsilenced, its parapet levelled for a long space: the garrison had\r\nto keep under cover. At dusk Major Thackeray, the senior engineer\r\nof the army, reported that the work could be stormed at any moment.\r\nAccording to Murray’s narrative Thackeray made at the same moment the\r\ncurious comment, that if the fort were escaladed and occupied, the\r\nground gained would be of no immediate use for the attack on the Upper\r\nCity, whose most accessible front--the bastions of San Juan and San\r\nPablo--might be much more easily battered from the slopes of the Olivo\r\nhill, farther inland, than from the low-lying site of the Fuerte Real.\r\nTo storm the outworks would cost men--to build new advanced batteries\r\non or near them would cost many more, since they were completely\r\ncommanded by the Upper City. ‘As the state of the fort was now such\r\nthat it could be taken whenever convenient,’ wrote Murray, ‘I consented\r\nto defer the attack, and directed that the fire upon it should continue\r\nonly sufficiently to prevent its being re-established[680].’\r\n\r\nThe decision seems of more than doubtful wisdom. It was from ground\r\nnear the Fuerte Real that Suchet had pushed forward his approaches\r\nin the siege of 1811, and his batteries in the lower town had proved\r\neffective. To resolve, after four days spent on battering the outworks,\r\nthat it was better to attack from a new front, was equivalent to\r\nsacrificing the whole of the exertions of those four days, and starting\r\nthe siege anew. But Murray accepted Thackeray’s scheme, though the\r\nengineer warned him that he should require fourteen days more of open\r\ntrenches to reduce the Upper City. This would relegate the crisis of\r\nthe final assault to July 21st, and meanwhile Suchet and Decaen would\r\nhave had three weeks to concentrate, instead of one. The time-problem\r\nlooked very unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nHowever the new plan was taken up--more artillery and engineer-stores\r\nand more guns were landed on the beach west of the mouth of the\r\nFrancoli, as were also the remainder of the horses of the cavalry and\r\nthe field-guns. The disembarkation was not always easy, as the surf\r\non the beach grew dangerous whenever the wind was high. On several\r\ndays communication with the shore had to be given up for many hours\r\non end. Murray complained that the foreign troops worked slowly and\r\nunwillingly, and that he had to replace them with British parties, in\r\norder to get up the ammunition from the boats to the batteries[681].\r\n\r\nHowever, progress was made, and in the four days between the 7th and\r\nthe 10th of June two heavy batteries were thrown up on the high-lying\r\nslopes of the Olivo hill, in positions from which they could bring an\r\nenfilading as well as a frontal fire to bear upon the three corner\r\nbastions of the Upper City, including the roughly repaired breaches in\r\nthe curtain, by which Suchet had made his entry in 1811. On the 9th and\r\nagain on the 10th Admiral Hallowell sent his available vessels in-shore\r\nto resume the bombardment; and late on the latter day the batteries\r\non the Olivo began their fire, which they continued on the following\r\nmorning: it was very effective, all the attacked bastions and the\r\ncurtain between them being much damaged. Meanwhile the old batteries\r\nby the Francoli overwhelmed the Fuerte Real and San Carlos forts with\r\nrenewed fire, destroying such repairs as the garrisons had been able to\r\ncarry out. The Governor, Bertoletti, made up his mind that there would\r\nbe a general assault both on the forts and on the Upper City on the\r\nnight of the 11th, and made such preparations as he could to receive\r\nit. But the prospect was gloomy--the garrison was worn out, the walls\r\nwere crumbling, and there seemed no hope of succour from without.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, harassed as the Governor might be, Murray was in an even\r\ngreater state of depression. He had never believed, as he acknowledged\r\nat his court martial, that he could succeed. The only gleam of hope\r\nwhich ever entered his mind was when on the morning of the 8th he\r\nreceived news that the fort of Balaguer had been taken, so that the\r\nroad by which Suchet could most easily arrive was completely blocked.\r\nAt any rate there would be a day or two gained, since the army of\r\nValencia would have to take difficult and circuitous roads, instead of\r\na short and direct one, when it came up.\r\n\r\nThe siege of the Fort of San Felipe de Balaguer had lasted four days.\r\nThe place was small, only sixty yards square; it mounted twelve\r\nguns, but was held by only a single company. It was in a rocky and\r\ninaccessible position, and when Colonel Prevost had landed with his\r\nbrigade, and had reconnoitred the place on the 3rd, he found that it\r\nmust be battered by heavy guns. Shelling it with field pieces proved\r\nunavailing. Accordingly aid was sought from the fleet, and with great\r\ndifficulty the sailors of the _Invincible_ got two 12-pounders and a\r\nhowitzer ashore, to a spot 700 yards from the fort. But the ground was\r\nso steep and rocky that it was difficult to construct a battery, and\r\nwhen the fire was opened it proved not very effective. It was only when\r\nmore guns had been hoisted up the rocks, to a position only 300 yards\r\nfrom the fort, that anything was accomplished. On the evening of the\r\n7th a lucky bomb from a mortar exploded one of the French magazines,\r\nand the commandant surrendered[682]. It was thought that he might have\r\nheld out longer, as his main magazine was intact--but nearly a third\r\nof his garrison of 150 men had been hurt, and their morale was low.\r\nWith the capture of Fort San Felipe the coast road became absolutely\r\nblocked to any troops coming from Suchet’s direction, and Murray, as\r\nhe confessed, ‘entertained a ray of hope, not so much of the capture\r\nof Tarragona itself, but that the expedition might prove, as Lord\r\nWellington wished it to prove, an effective diversion in favour of the\r\nallied army in Valencia[683].’ It was this success, as he explained,\r\nwhich encouraged him to remain two days longer in front of Tarragona\r\nthan he would otherwise have done, since the loss of the coast-road\r\nwould add two marches to the distance which Suchet had to cover in\r\norder to join Decaen.\r\n\r\nFor already this downhearted general was obsessed with panic fears\r\nthat the enemy might be upon him at any moment. He was gleaning in\r\nevery rumour of the near approach of Suchet and Decaen, however\r\nincredible. On the 4th he had received an express from Prevost, with a\r\nmessage that the Marshal had reached Tortosa and might be at the Col de\r\nBalaguer on the 5th. On the 7th there was a report that a heavy French\r\ncolumn was at Amposta, near the mouth of the Ebro, marching north. And\r\non the other side Decaen was said to be in movement--‘Could I ever\r\nhave expected,’ said Murray, a year later, ‘that his army would not be\r\nunited, that his movable column would have remained divided at Gerona,\r\nFigueras, and Barcelona[684]?’ Accordingly he wrote that night to\r\nWellington, ‘I am much afraid we have undertaken more than we are able\r\nto perform. But to execute your Lordship’s orders I shall persevere\r\nas long as prudence will permit. I have as yet no certain information\r\nof Suchet’s movements, nor of Decaen to the eastward. But there are\r\nreports of both, and if they prove true, in five or six days I may be\r\nattacked by a force infinitely superior, without the hope of a retreat\r\nin case of misfortune. I calculate that Suchet can bring into the field\r\n24,000 or 25,000 men without difficulty[685].’ There is not a thought\r\nin Murray’s brain of the chance that one of the enemy’s columns might\r\nbe late, and that it might be possible from his central position to\r\nfall upon the other, with his own forces and those of Copons united.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact things were working out most favourably for him.\r\nSuchet had seen the great transport-fleet pass the coast of Valencia\r\non the 31st May; but he was wholly in doubt whether the expedition\r\nmight be intending to strike at Tortosa or Tarragona, at Barcelona\r\nor Rosas. The Marshal had to make up his mind to act, before he knew\r\nhis enemy’s objective or his exact numbers. After many searchings of\r\nheart he resolved to keep the bulk of his forces in the kingdom of\r\nValencia, which he was most unwilling to give up, and to march with\r\na column of moderate strength to reinforce the Army of Catalonia. He\r\nleft Harispe in command in the South, with his own division, that of\r\nHabert, Severoli’s Italians, and the bulk of his cavalry, and resolved\r\nto move on Tortosa with Musnier’s division, his hussar regiment,\r\nthree batteries of artillery, and an improvised brigade under General\r\nPannetier, composed of four battalions borrowed some time back from the\r\nArmy of Catalonia, one battalion of his own, and an odd squadron of\r\nWestphalian light horse belonging to the Army of the Centre. The whole\r\nmade up about 8,000 men[686], a force so weak that it was clear that\r\nhe dared not attack Murray till he should be joined by the troops of\r\nDecaen. Pannetier’s brigade had a long start, as it was about Castellon\r\nand Segorbe when the order to march arrived: it reached Tortosa on\r\nJune 8th, and Perello on the Balaguer road on the 10th. Then the news\r\ncame in that the fort of San Felipe had capitulated two days before.\r\nPannetier halted, and sent back the information to Suchet, who had\r\nreached Tortosa on the 9th, escorted by a squadron of dragoons. But\r\nMusnier’s division had taken some time to assemble, only left Valencia\r\non the 7th, and was far behind. Suchet was in no small perplexity this\r\nday. The coast-road was blocked: it was the only one by which guns\r\nand transport could move directly on Tarragona. No news whatever had\r\nbeen received of Decaen and the Army of Catalonia. Musnier could not\r\nreach Tortosa till the 11th. Should he recall Pannetier, wait for the\r\narrival of the rest of his column, and then march with his whole force\r\nby the circuitous inland road along the Ebro, by Ginestar, Tivisa,\r\nand Momblanch, so as to reach the plain of Tarragona from the north?\r\nThis would lead to insufferable delays--the country was desolate and\r\nwaterless, and when the column reached its goal the Army of Copons,\r\nwith help perchance from Murray, would be in the way. Ten days might\r\neasily be wasted, and meanwhile Tarragona would probably have fallen.\r\nInformation must at all costs be got, and the Marshal finally ordered\r\nPannetier to drop all his impedimenta, and push with his infantry\r\nalone by mountain paths from Perello to Monroig, on the edge of the\r\nhills overlooking the plain of Tarragona. This was to take a dangerous\r\nrisk--a brigade of 2,500 bayonets might easily be surrounded by the\r\nCatalans and cut off. But the attention of Copons was at this moment\r\ndistracted to the other direction. Pannetier reached the slopes above\r\nMonroig on the night of the 11th-12th, and could get no information\r\nthere--the people had fled up into the mountains. The only fact that\r\ncame to his notice was that no cannonading could be heard next morning\r\nfrom the direction of Tarragona: the most natural deduction was\r\nthat the place had fallen. But in case it might still be resisting,\r\nPannetier ordered a row of bonfires to be lighted along the hillsides,\r\nwhich he thought would be visible to the beleaguered garrison, and\r\nwould show that succour was at hand. He then drew off again by the\r\nsame rough paths by which he had come, and returned to Valdellos,\r\nhalf-way back to Perello. From thence he could only send a report of\r\na negative kind to Suchet, who was left none the wiser for this risky\r\nreconnaissance. Meanwhile Musnier’s division had at last come up, but\r\nthere had also arrived the news that Del Parque and Elio were on the\r\nmove in Valencia, and were pushing back Harispe’s advanced troops. On\r\nthe 12th-13th-14th the Marshal remained stationary, waiting vainly\r\nfor news, and fearing the worst. Murray, if he had but known it, had\r\nnothing to fear from this quarter.\r\n\r\nOn the other flank also things were working out in the best possible\r\nfashion for the besieger of Tarragona. There was a long delay before\r\nthe Army of Catalonia could prepare a field force which could dare\r\nto face the Anglo-Sicilians. Decaen himself was at Gerona, far away\r\nto the North, and got the news of Murray’s landing on June 5th, by a\r\ndispatch sent him by Maurice Mathieu, Governor of Barcelona. He had no\r\ntroops under his hand save the four battalions of Beurmann’s brigade\r\nof Lamarque’s division; he could only collect more men by cutting down\r\nthe garrisons of Figueras and Puycerda, and calling in two brigades\r\n(those of Petit and Espert) which were acting as flying columns at the\r\nmoment, and were out of touch, in the sub-Pyrenean foot-hills. The news\r\nthat a very large disembarkation had taken place near Tarragona struck\r\nhim at first with such dismay that he replied to Maurice Mathieu that\r\nthey could not hope to resist such a force, and that it might even be\r\nnecessary to evacuate Barcelona[687]. However, resolving to do what\r\nhe could, he ordered Beurmann’s brigade to march on Barcelona (June\r\n8), and sent orders around for a general shifting of the northern\r\ngarrisons, so that he hoped to collect another 4,000 men at Gerona in\r\nthe course of a week, if the flying columns could be discovered and\r\nbrought in. With this reserve he intended to come down to join the rest\r\nof the field force about the 14th or 15th. Meanwhile he ordered Maurice\r\nMathieu to demonstrate against the enemy, without risking anything, or\r\nquitting the valley of the Llobregat and the vicinity of Barcelona.\r\n\r\nMaurice Mathieu was the only one of the generals in Catalonia, French\r\nor allied, who deserves any credit for his conduct in this campaign\r\nof blunders. He resolved that the one thing necessary was to take the\r\noffensive, and to threaten the besiegers of Tarragona, even if he\r\ndared not venture to attack them. Beurmann’s brigade having arrived on\r\nJune 10th, he marched next day with it and four battalions of his own\r\nto Villafranca, half-way between Barcelona and Tarragona, and drove\r\nin Copons’ outposts--leaving his base-fortress occupied by a very\r\ninadequate garrison. He had only 6,000 infantry and 300 horse with him,\r\nso that he was wholly incapable of facing Murray’s expeditionary force\r\nif it should show fight. Meanwhile he sent letters to Decaen, telling\r\nhim that the honour of the Army of Catalonia was at stake, and that it\r\nwas necessary for him to come down from Gerona without delay, and with\r\nevery available man. But the Commander-in-Chief did not appear--he was\r\ndetained by a naval demonstration in the Bay of Rosas. For Sir Edward\r\nPellew, then in command of the Mediterranean Fleet, had run down from\r\nhis usual cruising ground opposite Toulon, and concentrated a numerous\r\nsquadron off the coast of the Ampurdam. He came close in-shore, made a\r\ngreat display of boats, and even landed a few hundred marines on June\r\n8th. The news of this disembarkation filled Decaen with the idea that\r\nthe Tarragona expedition was only a snare, intended to make him draw\r\noff all his forces southward, and that the true blow would be struck\r\nat Rosas. He concentrated his scattered troops with the object of\r\nparrying it, and was so long in detecting his mistake that it was only\r\non June 15th that he set out from Gerona, with four battalions and\r\none squadron, to join Maurice Mathieu, having at last discovered that\r\nPellew could do no real mischief.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Barcelona, therefore, had never more than 6,000 men\r\nat his disposition during the critical days of the campaign--June\r\n11th-12th-13th-14th. He had, as has been mentioned above, reached\r\nVillafranca on the first-named day. There he received what had been\r\nlonged for in vain up till now, a detailed dispatch from Suchet,\r\nsetting forth his intentions. But it was no less than twelve days\r\nold, having been written at Valencia on May 31st, before the Marshal\r\nhad any knowledge of Murray’s strength, objective, or intentions. It\r\nstated that he was intending to march via Tortosa, and that he hoped\r\nthat Decaen with all his disposable field force would come down to\r\nmeet him at Reus, unless indeed the Anglo-Sicilians were aiming at\r\nsome more northern point, in which case he would have to follow them\r\nto Upper Catalonia. But he added that it was possible that the whole\r\nnaval expedition might be a mere feint, intended to lure him northward\r\nbeyond the Ebro; the fleet might turn back again and re-land the whole\r\nof Murray’s force near Valencia[688].\r\n\r\nThe dispatch was hopelessly out of date, and Maurice Mathieu had\r\nno means of knowing whether Suchet had carried out his original\r\nintentions. But his first impression was that he must seek for the\r\nMarshal at Reus, according to the directions given. Accordingly on\r\nJune 12 he pushed his vanguard as far as Arbos, six miles in advance\r\nof Villafranca, and some 24 miles from Tarragona. But nothing could\r\nbe heard of the Marshal’s approach, and Copons’ troops were gathering\r\nin from all sides to block the road, while Murray was only one march\r\naway. Seized with sudden misgivings at finding himself close to 20,000\r\nenemies with such a trilling force, Mathieu made up his mind that\r\nit would be madness to push on. At 10 o’clock on the night of the\r\n12th-13th[689] he evacuated both Arbos and Villafranca, and retreated\r\nin haste to Barcelona, to await the arrival of Decaen and the reserve.\r\n\r\nMurray’s miserable timidity now intervened, to save Tarragona, just\r\nwhen both the French forces had found themselves foiled, and had given\r\nup the relief of the fortress as impossible. The story reads like the\r\nplot of a stupid theatrical farce, where every character does the wrong\r\nthing, in order to produce absurd complications in the situation. On\r\nthe 12th Pannetier, on the hills above Monroig, heard no bombardment,\r\nbecause the bombardment had ceased. And Maurice Mathieu on the night of\r\nthat same day was running away from an enemy who had already absconded\r\nthat very afternoon. So, after coming within 35 miles of each other,\r\nthe two French generals had turned back in despair and given up the\r\ngame. But Murray had given it up also.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment had gone on very successfully throughout the 11th\r\nJune, and the engineers reported at noon that the Fuerte Real could\r\nbe stormed at any moment, and that the works of the Upper City were\r\ncrumbling in many places. Orders were issued that Mackenzie’s division\r\nshould storm the Fuerte Real at 10 p.m., while Clinton’s was to make\r\na demonstration against the Upper City. All arrangements were made,\r\nand after dark the troops designated for the assault filed into the\r\nadvanced trenches: the signal was to be by a flight of rockets[690].\r\nBut the rockets never went up.\r\n\r\nFor some days Murray had been in a state of agonized indecision. On the\r\n9th he had received information from a trusted secret agent in Valencia\r\nthat Suchet had marched for Tortosa on the 7th with 9,000 men--this was\r\nabsolutely certain and showed that all the previous rumours from the\r\nSouth had been false. On the same day a dispatch came in from Eroles at\r\nVich to say that a French column (Beurmann’s brigade) had left Gerona\r\non the 8th, marching for Barcelona, and that he intended to follow it\r\nwith his own detachment, and would join Copons before the enemy could\r\nconcentrate. The French then were on the move on both flanks--but\r\nstill far off. On the night of the 10th General Manso, commanding on\r\nCopons’ right flank, reported the approaching departure of Maurice\r\nMathieu from Barcelona, but overrated his force at 10,000 men. He\r\nundertook to detain them in the defiles beyond Villafranca for at least\r\none day. This news was corroborated next evening by an officer of\r\nWhittingham’s staff, who had seen the column, estimated it at 7,000 to\r\n8,000 infantry, and reported that it had entered Villafranca at 4 p.m.\r\non the 11th[691]. But it was the movements of Suchet which gave Murray\r\nthe greater alarm: by ingenious miscalculations[692] he had arrived at\r\nthe statistical conclusion that the Marshal had got 12,000 or 13,000\r\nmen of all arms with him, instead of the real 8,000[693]. And when the\r\narrival of Pannetier’s brigade at Perello on the 10th was reported\r\nto him on the following day, he proceeded to assume that the French\r\ncolumn was all closed up: ‘the Marshal with 13,000 men was within two\r\nlong marches of Tarragona[694].’ Many generals would have asked for no\r\nbetter opportunity than that of being placed in a central position with\r\nsome 23,000 men--the Anglo-Sicilian troops and those of Copons exceeded\r\nthat figure--while two hostile columns, one of 13,000 men and the other\r\nof 10,000, 35 miles apart, were trying to join each other across a\r\ndifficult country by bad roads. (As a matter of fact, of course, the\r\nFrench force was much smaller--no more than 8,000 men on the West, and\r\n6,000 on the East, though Murray must not be too much blamed for the\r\nover-estimate.) But the two governing ideas that ruled in the brain\r\nof the unfortunate general were firstly the memory of Wellington’s\r\nwarning that ‘the one thing that could not be forgiven would be that\r\nthe corps should be beaten or dispersed’, and secondly the fact that\r\nhis army was composed of heterogeneous material, some of which might\r\nbe found wanting at a crisis. But he concealed his downheartedness\r\ntill the last moment, both from his own lieutenants and from the\r\nSpaniards. On the 10th he rode out to meet General Copons at Torre dem\r\nBarra, to which place the Catalan head-quarters had just been moved,\r\nand agreed with him to defend the line of the Gaya river against the\r\ncolumn coming from Barcelona. He promised to send up all his cavalry,\r\n8,000 infantry, and two field batteries to join the Spanish army, which\r\nwas now concentrated across the two roads by which Tarragona could be\r\napproached from Villafranca. Five battalions were on the northern road,\r\nby the Col de Santa Cristina, four and the three squadrons of horse on\r\nthe southern route, nearer the sea. Warnings were issued to Clinton’s\r\nand Whittingham’s divisions, and also to Lord Frederick Bentinck, the\r\ncavalry brigadier, to be ready to march to the line of the Gaya[695].\r\nThis looked like business, and the spirits of the Anglo-Sicilians were\r\nhigh that night.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 11th, while the bombardment of Tarragona was\r\ngoing on in a very satisfactory way, Murray rode out again, met Copons\r\nat Vendrils, behind the Gaya, and spent much time in inspecting\r\nthe chosen positions. He disliked them; the river was fordable in\r\nmany places, and a very long front would have to be guarded: it was\r\nconsidered that the French might break through by one of the roads\r\nbefore the troops guarding the other could arrive. However, adhering to\r\nhis promise of the 10th, Murray ordered up Bentinck with two squadrons\r\nof hussars and two guns to the mouth of the Gaya, where they took over\r\nthe outposts on the coast-road. The infantry was not brought up--as the\r\nassault on Tarragona was to take place that evening. The only news from\r\nthe front received in the afternoon were rumours that Maurice Mathieu\r\nhad actually reached Villafranca[696].\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock Murray started home, and reached his head-quarters\r\nbefore Tarragona two hours later. There he found a batch of reports\r\nawaiting him, which finally broke down his resolution to fight, and\r\ndrove him to the ignominious flight which he had already contemplated\r\non more than one day during the preceding week. Two Spanish officers\r\nhad come in from the Col de Santa Cristina, to report that the\r\nBarcelona column had certainly occupied Villafranca, and was apparently\r\npushing on beyond it: this was discouraging. But the document which\r\nMurray regarded as all-important was a note from his adjutant-general,\r\nDonkin, to the effect that peasants, who had just come in from Perello,\r\nreported that Suchet’s column had continued its advance: ‘This corps\r\nof infantry may be at Reus to-morrow, if they think proper to march\r\nby Perello _without artillery_. And Decaen (i. e. Mathieu), if he\r\nmarched this day to Villafranca, can also reach Reus to-morrow. This\r\npossibility may, perhaps, make some change in your arrangements[697].’\r\nAs a matter of fact, we have already seen that it was only Pannetier’s\r\nbrigade which had gone across the hills from Perello towards Monroig,\r\nand that this was a mere reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nBut Donkin’s picture of Suchet and the Barcelona column joining at\r\nReus, in his rear, on the 12th, with forces which Murray’s imagination\r\nraised to 25,000 men, was so much in consonance with the fears which\r\nhad been obsessing the brains of the Commander-in-Chief throughout\r\nthe last ten days, that he felt that his nightmare was coming true.\r\nThere could be no doubt that he was on the brink of a disaster like\r\nthe Ostend catastrophe of 1798[698]. Of course Suchet’s active brain\r\nhad planned his complete destruction. He tells us in his defence[699]\r\nthat he asked himself whether it was probable that an officer of the\r\nMarshal’s activity and reputation would have left a man more than he\r\ncould help in Valencia. ‘Was it the character of a French general to\r\nact with inadequate means when ample means were within his reach? Was\r\nit probable that he would have brought a small force only from the\r\nXucar by the fatiguing march to Tortosa? Would he have left a man idle\r\nin the south when in danger of losing his communication with France?\r\nEvery disposable corps, many more than what might be calculated to be\r\nfairly disposable, must be with the Marshal.’ He might have not 13,000\r\nmen but many more. And the Barcelona column might be not 10,000 men but\r\n13,000.\r\n\r\nRather than take the risk of waiting one day longer in his present\r\nposition, Murray resolved to abscond by sea, while the enemy was still\r\ntwenty miles away from Tarragona. By 9.30 p.m. he had sent his staff\r\nofficers with messages to his divisional generals to stop the projected\r\nassault, to order all guns, horses, and stores to be got on shipboard,\r\nand the infantry after them. He calculated, in his panic, that he had\r\nonly eighteen hours in hand: the re-embarkation must be over by dusk\r\non the 12th. But the most disgraceful part of his scheme was that he\r\nhad resolved to leave Copons and the Catalans to their fate, after\r\nhaving brought them to the Gaya by definite promises of assistance,\r\nwithout which they would never have taken up their fighting position,\r\nand this though he had renewed his pledges that same morning. He sent\r\nno warning of his real intentions to his colleague, but only told him\r\nthat recent information had made it necessary for him to re-embark his\r\nbattering train; but six Anglo-Sicilian battalions should be sent out\r\nnext morning, to strengthen the force behind the Gaya.\r\n\r\nThere followed a night and a morning of confusion. No one in the\r\nexpeditionary force had hitherto suspected Murray’s wavering\r\nconfidence, except Admiral Hallowell, to whom he had on June 9th made\r\nthe remark that he imagined that they ought to be thinking about\r\ngetting away in safety rather than about prolonging the siege, and\r\nthe Quartermaster-General, Donkin, to whom on the same day Murray\r\nhad said that he suspected that they would have ere long to depart,\r\nwhereupon that officer had drawn up a secret scheme for the details of\r\nre-embarkation[700]. But since nothing more had been heard about such\r\na move on the 10th or the 11th, Hallowell and Donkin had supposed that\r\nthe idea was abandoned. Clinton and the other senior officers had been\r\nkept entirely in the dark, till the sudden orders of 9.30 p.m. were\r\ndelivered to them. At midnight Admiral Hallowell came in to Murray’s\r\nquarters to protest against the hasty departure, which would cause all\r\nmanner of confusion and ensure the loss of much valuable material:\r\nthey parted after an angry altercation. Colonel Williamson (commanding\r\nthe artillery) also appeared, to say that in the time given him he\r\ncould get off the guns in the batteries near the shore, but not those\r\non the distant Olivo. He understood the general to reply that he might\r\nbe granted some extra hours, and that the Olivo guns might be brought\r\ndown after dark on the 12th[701].\r\n\r\nBut in the morning Murray’s apprehension grew progressively worse.\r\nHe had at first intended to do something to cover Copons’ inevitable\r\nretreat, and ordered Clinton to throw out six battalions towards the\r\nGaya. But he soon cancelled this order, and directed Bentinck to bring\r\nback his cavalry and guns from Altafulla without delay. At 9 a.m. a\r\nmessage was sent to Williamson, to say that the guns on the Olivo\r\nmust be spiked or destroyed, as it would be perilous to wait till\r\nnight[702]. Half an hour later Murray’s notions of retreat flickered\r\nround to a new scheme--the troops on the shore should embark there;\r\nbut those on the northern heights--the divisions of Clinton and\r\nWhittingham--should march to the Col de Balaguer via Constanti, and\r\ntake ship in the much better harbourage behind Cape Salou. Half an hour\r\nlater he abandoned this scheme, and ordered them down to the beach by\r\nthe Francoli, there to embark without delay.\r\n\r\nThis dispatch reduced Clinton to a state of cold rage: at the court\r\nmartial in 1814 he produced seven separate orders which he had\r\nreceived between dawn and 1.30 that day: they were all contradictory,\r\nand deserve record as showing Murray’s state of mind during the\r\ncritical hours. (1) The first, received early, directed him to take\r\nsix battalions towards the Gaya, to cover the retreat of Copons from\r\nAltafulla. (2) The second, sent off at 9 o’clock, told him not to\r\nexecute this march, but to wait till the Spaniards had cleared off,\r\nand then to move, not with six battalions but with the whole of his\r\nown and Whittingham’s divisions, to Constanti[703]. (3) The third\r\nwas to the effect that the baggage should be sent to the Col de\r\nBalaguer, to which the whole army would now proceed[704]. (4) Half an\r\nhour later Clinton was told to cancel the last two dispatches, and to\r\ncome down to head-quarters on the nearest beach. (5) A supplementary\r\nverbal order directed that the guns in the Olivo batteries should be\r\nspiked. (6) Twenty minutes later Clinton was told that the guns might\r\nstill be saved: Whittingham’s Spaniards should remain on the Olivo\r\nand guard them till dusk, when the artillery would try to get them\r\ndown to the shore. (7) Lastly, at 1.30, the final order cancelled the\r\nsixth, it directed (once more) that Whittingham’s troops must follow\r\nClinton’s for instant embarkation, and that the guns should be spiked\r\nwithout delay. This was done, to the intense disgust of the gunners,\r\nwho had been getting everything ready for an orderly retreat after\r\ndusk. Seventeen heavy pieces in good condition, and one more which had\r\nbeen disabled, were spiked and left in the Olivo batteries, while the\r\ninfantry hurried down to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe momentary wavering in Murray’s orders during the early morning,\r\nwhen he seemed inclined to risk a longer stay, and to march Clinton’s\r\ndivision and the baggage by land to the anchorage by the Col de\r\nBalaguer, was apparently caused partly by new remonstrances from\r\nHallowell, partly by an interview with some of his subordinates,\r\nsomewhere between 8 and 9 a.m., Mackenzie, Adam, Donkin, and Thackeray,\r\nthe chief engineer, entered the house of the Commander-in-Chief\r\ntogether, and Adam, as their spokesman, urged him with great heat\r\nnot to embark, but to advance, join Copons, and attack the French\r\non the Gaya with every available man. Murray replied that if he did\r\nso, the French would refuse to fight and give back toward Barcelona;\r\nwhile Suchet, coming from the other direction, would cut him off from\r\nthe fleet and relieve Tarragona. But if, on the other hand, he were\r\nto march against Suchet, and stop him, then the Barcelona column\r\nwould relieve Tarragona and get the expeditionary force separated\r\nfrom its transports. Either course would be equally ruinous. He also\r\nsaid that Wellington had told him ‘not to commit the army’. The\r\ngenerals withdrew--further insistence would have amounted to military\r\ninsubordination. The final hurry-scurry order, to destroy the guns and\r\nembark pell-mell, was caused by news from Copons that the French at\r\nVillafranca had advanced as far as Arbos, only ten miles from the Gaya,\r\nand seemed still to be coming on.\r\n\r\nDuring the night and the morning that followed all the guns from the\r\nlower batteries, much valuable material, some of the cavalry, and the\r\ninfantry of Adam, were got aboard. The shipment of artillery stores\r\nwas still proceeding at 10 o’clock, when Murray ordered that nothing\r\nbut men should now be embarked--all else must be abandoned. Admiral\r\nHallowell, who was superintending the work on the beach in person, was\r\nmuch incensed with this resolve, and took it upon himself to direct the\r\nsailors in the boats to refuse infantry, and to go on lading stores.\r\nThen came a deadlock--Hallowell said that there was plenty of time\r\nto take off everything: Donkin, coming down from Murray’s quarters,\r\nmaintained that the French were only two and a half hours’ march away,\r\nand that the infantry must be got off at all costs: horses and mules\r\nmight have to be shot, and food and ammunition abandoned[705]. There\r\nwas much disputing, but the naval men, obeying the admiral, continued\r\nto embark horses and artillery material till midday, when Mackenzie’s\r\ninfantry began to pour down to the beaches, followed by Clinton’s\r\nand Whittingham’s battalions[706]. All through the afternoon the\r\nshipping off of troops continued without any interruption, till only\r\na rearguard of 500 of Clinton’s men was left on shore. No news of the\r\nFrench coming to hand, there was a relaxation of the wild hurry which\r\nhad prevailed between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Murray permitted Bentinck to\r\ntake that part of the cavalry which had not yet embarked round to the\r\nanchorage by the Col de Balaguer by land[707], and sent on behind\r\nthem twelve field-guns escorted by a half battalion of the 2/27th.\r\nMeanwhile, the troops having all got off, the boats began to load again\r\nwith transport mules, entrenching tools, spare shot, platform timbers,\r\nsand bags, and biscuit. The rear guard was not taken off till late\r\nat night; and, even after it was gone and dawn had come, the sailors\r\ncontinued to find and take off various valuable leavings[708]. No\r\nmolestation whatever was suffered from the garrison, who regarded the\r\nwhole movement as inexplicable, and only crept out with caution after\r\nthe last British troops had disappeared, to find 18 spiked guns and\r\nsome artillery stores in the Olivo batteries, and a certain amount of\r\nflour and beef barrels left on the shore. The most distressing part of\r\nthe chronicle of this wretched day’s work is Murray’s dealings with\r\nCopons. He had induced the Captain-General to bring his army to the\r\nline of the Gaya, by the promise of supporting him with 8,000 men,\r\nrenewed on the morning of the 11th. At dawn on the 12th the message was\r\nsent that six battalions only could be spared. An hour or two later\r\nCopons received the crushing news that the whole expeditionary army was\r\nabout to re-embark, abandoning him to his own resources. If Murray’s\r\nview of the situation had been correct, the Spaniards must have been\r\ncaught between Suchet advancing on Reus and Mathieu converging on the\r\nsame point from Villafranca. His moral guilt, therefore, was very\r\ngreat. But, as a matter of fact, nothing disastrous happened. On\r\nhearing that he had been left in the lurch, Copons withdrew the troops\r\nwhich he had at Altafulla on the coast-road, to join those at the\r\nCol de Santa Cristina, leaving the way to Tarragona open to Maurice\r\nMathieu, and preparing to retreat into the mountains if necessary. He\r\nkept a close look-out upon the French column, and was astonished on\r\nthe morning of the 13th to learn that, after sending a vanguard to\r\nArbos on the previous day, six miles down the southern road, it had\r\nturned back at ten o’clock at night, and was now in full retreat on\r\nBarcelona. The crisis was over for the moment. Copons returned to his\r\nold head-quarters at Reus, threw out a slight screen of troops to the\r\nline of Gaya, and reoccupied Villafranca with a few cavalry. He was\r\nquite ready to retreat into the mountains once more if any untoward\r\ndevelopments should supervene.\r\n\r\nOn June 13th Murray had all his army on shipboard,[709] save Prevost’s\r\ntwo battalions at the Col de Balaguer, and the guns and cavalry with\r\nBentinck, which had marched by land to that same pass. Wellington’s\r\norders told him that if he failed at Tarragona he was to return to\r\nValencia, join Elio and Del Parque, and fall upon the diminished French\r\nforce on the Xucar before Suchet could get back. It was his obvious\r\nduty to pick up Prevost’s and Bentinck’s detachments, and to depart at\r\nonce. He did nothing of the kind, but proceeded to employ himself for\r\nseveral days in minor operations, in the vain hope of redeeming the\r\ndisgrace of June 12th.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 13th Murray received news from Colonel Prevost\r\nat San Felipe to the effect that the French column in front of him\r\n(Pannetier’s brigade), about 3,000 strong, had marched from Perello\r\nby mountain paths eastward, but had not been followed by Suchet’s\r\nmain body. Prevost thought that it might be intending to cut him off\r\nfrom the rest of the army by dropping down into the coast-road in his\r\nrear. Pannetier’s movement was also reported by Bentinck, whose flank\r\npatrols had run against similar parties of the French while on their\r\nway to the Col de Balaguer. It was necessary to bring off Prevost, the\r\ncavalry, and the guns by sea, if the French were trying to get round\r\nthem. So Murray asked Admiral Hallowell to send ships in-shore to the\r\nCol, and with them part of Mackenzie’s division[710], to act as a\r\ncovering force for the re-embarkation of Prevost’s detachment. These\r\ntroops--apparently three battalions--were landed near the fort late on\r\nthe evening of the 13th.\r\n\r\nNow during that day Pannetier, conscious that he was too far away from\r\nhis chief, and quite ‘in the air,’ had drawn back from near Monroig\r\nto Valdellos, ten miles nearer to Perello. The same idea had occurred\r\nto Suchet, who simultaneously brought up his main body from Tortosa\r\nto Perello, though he knew that the coast-road was blocked by the\r\nBritish force holding Fort San Felipe. But on the morning of the 14th\r\nthe Marshal, exploring toward the Col, sighted not only Mackenzie’s\r\ninfantry on shore, but the whole transport fleet lying off the coast\r\nfrom opposite the fort as far as Cape Salou--180 ships small and great,\r\nas he counted. A frigate and two brigs took a number of long shots at\r\nthe Marshal and his large escort, which had to retire in haste. Suchet\r\nsaw the whole expeditionary force before him, and recognized that he\r\nwas too weak to tackle it. Wherefore he sent orders to Pannetier to\r\nfall back and rejoin him--and came to a halt. Early on the morning of\r\nthe 15th he wrote to Decaen:\r\n\r\n‘The loss of the Col de Balaguer has foiled all my plans. The English\r\nfleet fired more than a thousand shot at us. Menaced by forces of four\r\ntimes my own strength, I wish to know what you propose to do. The enemy\r\n[Del Parque] has attacked my lines on the Xucar[711].’\r\n\r\nThis last fact, at the moment, was worrying Suchet even more than the\r\nunknown fate of Tarragona, for Harispe had just reported that the two\r\nSpanish armies in Valencia had advanced against him in force, and on\r\na long front. Now, while the Marshal halted in indecision, Murray was\r\nseized with a spasmodic fit of energy--he knew that Maurice Mathieu was\r\nfor the moment out of the game; he saw that Suchet was blocked, and\r\nthat Pannetier was in a dangerously advanced position. He conceived\r\nthe idea that he might land more troops at the Col, and strike in\r\nbetween the French main body and the brigade at Valdellos. To the\r\nastonishment of his subordinates he ordered the rest of Mackenzie’s\r\ntroops and all Clinton’s to be landed, as also the remainder of the\r\ncavalry, and instructed Mackenzie to make a forced march on Valdellos\r\nand beat up Pannetier’s camp. The General did so, but arrived only just\r\nin time to see the French rearguard absconding on the 15th[712]. This\r\ndemonstration of energy having failed, as it was pretty certain to do\r\n(for events like the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos are not common),\r\nMurray had another inspiration. On the evening of the 15th[713] he\r\nsuggested to Admiral Hallowell that the garrison of Tarragona must now\r\nbe quite off their guard, that they had not been strengthened, and that\r\nit might be possible to re-embark 5,000 men secretly at Fort Balaguer,\r\nland them at Cambrils, and make a sudden dash at Tarragona by escalade\r\nor surprise. The Admiral answered that as Murray had not felt himself\r\nequal to storming Tarragona when the whole army was with him, and the\r\nbatteries playing on the place, he (Hallowell) did not think him equal\r\nto it now with 5,000 men[714]. The idea was dropped: it was not without\r\nits merits, but though Picton or Craufurd might have succeeded in such\r\na desperate stroke, Murray would certainly have failed from lack of\r\nnerve at the decisive moment, as the Admiral meant to insinuate.\r\n\r\nThis wretched campaign was now nearing its end--but still reserved two\r\nextraordinary surprises for its last days. On the 16th Suchet, much\r\nimpressed with the strength which Murray had shown, judging from the\r\nstroke at Valdellos that he was thinking of taking the offensive, and\r\nharassed by fresh news of Del Parque’s advance on Valencia, retired\r\nfrom Perello, and took his main body back across the Ebro to Amposta,\r\nwhich he reached on the 17th. He left only Pannetier’s brigade and the\r\nhussar regiment to watch Murray. Thus the Anglo-Sicilians had opposite\r\nthem on the south only 3,000 men, from whom no possible danger could be\r\napprehended. But their General had no idea as yet that only a rearguard\r\nlay before him, and imagined that the Marshal and his main body were\r\nclose in Pannetier’s rear.\r\n\r\nThe second surprise took place on the other front. Maurice Mathieu\r\nhad got back to Barcelona by a forced march on the 13th. On the next\r\nday spies brought him the news that Murray had raised the siege of\r\nTarragona, and gone away with his whole army by sea. There was nothing\r\nto prevent him from relieving Bertoletti’s garrison, save Copons’\r\ntroops holding the line of the Gaya. Therefore, although Decaen had\r\nnot yet arrived from the North, and indeed had written that he could\r\nnot start from Gerona until the 17th, Mathieu resolved to make a\r\nsecond attempt to reach Tarragona. He could still count on no greater\r\nforce than the 6,000 men with which he had made his first fruitless\r\nexpedition, but he thought this sufficient to deal with the Catalans.\r\nHe moved once more upon Villafranca early on the 15th, and reached\r\nthat place the same night. Next day a forced march of twenty-four\r\nmiles brought him to Tarragona unopposed; for Copons would not fight\r\nwhen unsupported by Murray, and had withdrawn his troops to Valls. At\r\nTarragona Mathieu learned that the Anglo-Sicilians had not disappeared\r\nentirely from Catalonia, as he had hitherto believed, but were\r\nconcentrated at and about the Col de Balaguer. Though no news had been\r\nreceived from Suchet, it might be conjectured that Murray had landed at\r\nthe Col in order to hold back the Marshal, who could not be very far\r\noff. On the morning of the 17th Mathieu resolved to take the risky step\r\nof advancing by the coast-road to feel for Murray’s rear, and marched\r\nout to Cambrils six miles west of Tarragona, hoping to hear that Suchet\r\nwas simultaneously attacking the front of the Anglo-Sicilians. He was\r\nthereby exposing himself to fearful danger, for Murray had his whole\r\n15,000 men in hand, and quite disposable, since Suchet had withdrawn\r\nsouthward on the 16th. And Copons at Valls was in a position to cut in\r\nupon the rear of the Barcelona column with 6,000 men more: each of them\r\nwas only ten miles from Cambrils, and they were in full communication\r\nwith each other. Indeed, Murray had sent to Copons late on the 16th,\r\nimploring him to fall upon the flank of the enemy, though he spoilt the\r\neffect of the appeal by explaining that he was going to be attacked\r\nby Suchet and the Barcelona column simultaneously, and expected to\r\nbe outnumbered--the Marshal had 24,000 men (!), while 8,000 men were\r\ncoming via Tarragona against his rear. Startled by these astounding\r\nfigures, the Spanish General did not actually attack Maurice Mathieu,\r\nbut contented himself with bringing forward his infantry to La Selva\r\nand feeling for the French column by cavalry patrols sent out from Reus.\r\n\r\nThe 17th June was a day as full of ridiculous cross-purposes as the\r\n12th. Suchet’s main body was in full march for Amposta and the road to\r\nValencia[715], just as Maurice Mathieu was at last coming to look for\r\nit. Murray in the centre was expecting to be attacked on both sides\r\nof the Col de Balaguer, believing that the reckless advance of the\r\nBarcelona column was timed to coincide with a desperate assault on the\r\nCol by Suchet and his whole army. Mathieu was advancing in ignorance\r\ninto a death-trap, if he had only known it, expecting every moment to\r\nhear guns in his front, or to get news of Suchet by spies or patrols.\r\nCopons was hanging back on Mathieu’s flank, deterred from pressing in\r\nby Murray’s ridiculous overstatement of the total French force. If\r\nMurray had marched from the Col that morning early with 10,000 men\r\nand had met the French column at Cambrils, while the Catalans closed\r\nin on its rear, no possible chance could have saved it from complete\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nBut Murray was doing something very different; after having made his\r\nurgent appeal to Copons to take part in a general action on the 17th,\r\nit occurred to him that a general action might perhaps be avoided by\r\nthe simple method of absconding once more by sea--and again leaving the\r\nCatalans to shift for themselves. Mackenzie was back from Valdellos,\r\nand the whole force was concentrated in the pass, with the immense\r\ntransport fleet at its elbow, and several decent embarkation places.\r\nIn the morning he called a council of war--which, as the old military\r\nproverb goes, ‘never fights’--though he had assured Admiral Hallowell\r\non the preceding night that he had chosen his positions, and intended\r\nto stand and receive the enemy’s attack[716]. The council of war voted,\r\nby a large majority, for embarkation--probably as has been acutely\r\nobserved[717], because none of the generals liked the idea of being\r\ncommanded in action by Murray, after their recent experience of his\r\nmethods. The preparations for departure were begun on the afternoon of\r\nthe 17th, but no notice of them was sent to Copons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maurice Mathieu had halted at Cambrils: he could get no news\r\nof Suchet, and no firing could be heard in front. On the other hand,\r\nBritish warships ran close in-shore, and began to cannonade his column,\r\nas it defiled along the coast-road. And his cavalry patrols discovered\r\nthose of Copons in front of Reus, and afterwards got in touch with the\r\nSpanish infantry behind them. The situation was getting unpleasant; and\r\nrealizing that he had better draw back, Mathieu turned the head of his\r\ncolumn inland to Reus, for he was determined not to expose it a second\r\ntime to the fire of the British ships, which swept the coast-road at\r\nmany points. Marching in the night of the 17th-18th he almost surprised\r\nCopons, who had brought his infantry up to Reus in order to fall in\r\nwith Murray’s plan for attacking the enemy in flank. But the Spaniard\r\nwas warned in time, and escaped to La Selva, from whence he wrote to\r\nMurray, to complain that the British had not kept their part of the\r\nbargain, nor even sent him news of Mathieu’s retirement from their\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nAt Reus the French General picked up the spy to whom Suchet had\r\nentrusted his despairing note of June 15, which avowed his impotence\r\nand asked what the Army of Catalonia could do[718]. Seeing that he must\r\nhope for no help from the Marshal, Mathieu retreated by the inland road\r\nto Constanti, two miles from Tarragona (June 18), where he halted for a\r\nday, after sending on Suchet’s letter to his chief Decaen, and renewing\r\nhis former petitions that the reserves from the North should get to\r\nBarcelona as soon as possible. It was clear that the Army of Catalonia\r\nmust save itself, without any aid from the Army of Valencia.\r\n\r\nWhile Maurice Mathieu stood doubting at Cambrils, and all through\r\nthe night hours while he was marching on Reus, there had been a\r\nrapid shifting of scenes at the Col de Balaguer. Murray’s orders for\r\nre-embarkation were just drawn up when a formidable fleet of men-of-war\r\nbecame visible on the horizon, and presently ran close in-shore. This\r\nwas Sir Edward Pellew with the Toulon blockading squadron, twelve line\r\nof battle ships, besides smaller craft. They had run down from the Bay\r\nof Rosas, after picking up at Port Mahon a vessel from Sicily, on which\r\nwas Lord William Bentinck, who had at last arrived to assume command of\r\nthe Anglo-Sicilian army. He had torn himself away with some reluctance\r\nfrom his plans for raising a general insurrection in Italy against\r\nNapoleon, having satisfied himself that there was no risk of Murat’s\r\ninvading Sicily in his absence, and that the local politics of Palermo\r\nwere deplorable but not dangerous[719]. When the signal was made from\r\nPellew’s flagship that Lord William had arrived, Admiral Hallowell\r\nanswered with the counter-signal, ‘We are all delighted,’ which was\r\nsincere and accurate, but not officially correct. It was remembered\r\nagainst him afterwards, as an improper ebullition of misplaced humour.\r\n\r\nBentinck landed at San Felipe without a moment’s delay, took over\r\nthe command from Murray, and heard his report. He also talked with\r\nHallowell and the senior land-officers. He made up his mind very\r\npromptly: the embarkation which had begun was to continue, and the\r\nArmy was to be taken back to Valencia at once, in strict consonance\r\nwith Wellington’s original orders. He explained in his next dispatch\r\nhome that he was aware that he might have chased Maurice Mathieu, and\r\nprobably have compelled him to throw himself into Tarragona. But he\r\nconceived that a second siege of that fortress would take many days,\r\nand would not be so profitable to the general cause as an unexpected\r\nreturn to Valencia to join Del Parque and Elio. The Army, as he wrote\r\nto Wellington, was in the best spirits, but most dissatisfied as to\r\nwhat had happened before Tarragona, ‘concerning which, from motives of\r\ndelicacy, he would refrain from saying anything[720].’ But there had\r\nbeen much material lost, the horses and mules were in a bad way, from\r\nhaving been so often landed and reshipped, and it was better to return\r\nto Alicante and reorganize everything than to start another Catalan\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe troops were got on board very rapidly, and the whole transport\r\nfleet set sail southward on the 18th. The fort of San Felipe was\r\nblown up, as Bentinck was not willing to leave any troops behind to\r\ngarrison it. Unfortunately, the good weather which had been granted\r\nto Murray at the starting of the expedition was denied to Bentinck\r\nduring its return. A furious north-east wind was blowing, which\r\nscattered the ships, and drove no less than fourteen of them ashore\r\non the projecting sands at the estuary of the Ebro. Ten were got off\r\nwhen the storm moderated, but four had to be burned, after the crews\r\nand troops had been taken off. Bentinck, after four days at sea, got\r\ninto Alicante on the 22nd June, ahead of the great majority of the\r\ntransports, which continued to drop in, some much disabled, for three\r\nor four days after. This caused a tiresome delay in the reorganization\r\nof the army, as odd companies of every regiment were missing, and the\r\nunits could not be re-formed and marched inland for some time. The\r\ndelay gave Bentinck time to write long dispatches to the Secretary\r\nfor War and to Wellington. These went off on the 23rd by special\r\nmessenger, and along with them lengthy screeds from Murray and Admiral\r\nHallowell. The two officers wrote most bitterly of each other to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief--the Admiral detailing all the General’s hesitations\r\nand tergiversations with caustic irony, while the General wrote that\r\n‘if I had only allowed the Admiral to command the army you would never\r\nhave been troubled with the long letter which accompanies this....\r\nHe thinks that prejudice against him led me to act as I did. These\r\nare the real grounds of all his outcry[721].’ Murray’s long dispatch\r\nwas not only very disingenuous in suppression of facts, but so vague\r\nconcerning all necessary dates and figures, that Wellington, when it\r\ncame to hand, showed profound dissatisfaction. He observed that it\r\n‘left him entirely ignorant of what had occurred,’ and administered\r\na searching interrogatory of eleven questions, answers to which were\r\nnecessary before a judgement could be formed by himself or the Home\r\nGovernment on what had really happened in Catalonia[722]. Murray’s\r\nreplies were as unconvincing as his original dispatches, and the matter\r\nended in a long-deferred and lengthy court martial at Winchester in\r\n1814, after the war had come to an end. To describe it here would\r\ninterrupt unseasonably the narrative of the summer campaign of 1813.\r\nBut it may suffice to say that he did not get his deserts. He was only\r\nconvicted of an error of judgement, and not of the ‘disobedience to\r\norders and neglect of duty, highly to the prejudice of the service, and\r\ndetrimental to the British military character’ for which he was put on\r\ntrial. He was never even indicted for his worst offence--the callous\r\nbetrayal of the Spanish colleague who had done his best to serve him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON ON THE BIDASSOA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 1st the last of Foy’s troops on the sea-coast front had\r\nrecrossed the lower Bidassoa, leaving Graham and Giron in complete\r\npossession of the Spanish bank, and free to commence the siege of St.\r\nSebastian. They had 25,000 men in line, without counting Mendizabal’s\r\nBiscayan irregulars, who were observing the fortress, and the 5th\r\nBritish Division, which was now on its march from Vittoria to the\r\nfrontier, and was due to arrive on the 5th or 6th. These forces were\r\namply sufficient to hold in check Reille, Foy, and the Bayonne Reserve.\r\n\r\nOn July 1st also Wellington began to arrange his march northward from\r\nPampeluna, which might have begun on the 26th June if he had not taken\r\noff so many divisions for the fruitless pursuit of Clausel. The five\r\ndays’ respite granted to the enemy had been very useful to him. If\r\nthe King had been followed up without delay, at the moment when he\r\nhad split his army into the three columns, which marched the first\r\nby Yrurzun and Santesteban (Reille), the second by the Col de Velate\r\n(D’Erlon), and the third by the Pass of Roncesvalles (Gazan), it is\r\nhard to say where or how he could have rallied or offered any effective\r\nresistance. Wellington had preferred to take the doubtful chance of\r\nintercepting and destroying a secondary force, rather than to devote\r\nhimself to the relentless pursuit of the demoralized main body of the\r\nenemy. But it must be remembered that a resolve to push the chase after\r\nthe flying King would have involved an instant invasion of France.\r\nAnd though on general military grounds a defeated enemy should be\r\nkept on the run and destroyed in detail--like Brunswick’s army after\r\nJena--there were in June-July 1813 the strongest political reasons to\r\ndeter Wellington from crossing the frontier. It was not merely that he\r\nhad outmarched his transport, and had not yet got into touch with his\r\nnew bases of supply at Santander and on the Biscay coast, so that for\r\nthe moment he was a little short of ammunition, and also living on\r\nthe country, a practice which he disliked on principle and wished to\r\nend as soon as possible[723]. Nor was his hindrance the fact that his\r\narmy was tired and sulky, and that many of his stragglers had not yet\r\nrejoined--though both of these vexations had their weight[724]. Nor was\r\nthe political consideration that held him back the deplorable news from\r\nCadiz, received at Caseda on June 28th, to the effect that the Regency\r\nhad deposed Castaños from his office as Captain-General of Galicia,\r\nEstremadura, and both the Castiles, and had superseded his nephew\r\nGeneral Giron in the command of the Fourth Army[725]. This was indeed\r\na serious blow--not so much because Wellington could always rely on\r\nCastaños, and had found Giron more obedient than most Spanish officers,\r\nbut because it looked as if the Cadiz Government was aiming at an open\r\nrepudiation of the bargain that had been made in January, by which\r\nthey had agreed not to make or revoke appointments of the military\r\nsort without giving notice, and receiving approval. The excuses given\r\nfor the changes were paltry and unconvincing--Castaños was wanted to\r\ntake his seat in the Council of State--Giron was to be sent, with\r\nlarge reinforcements, to serve with Copons as second in command of\r\nthe Army of Catalonia. Wellington concluded, and rightly, that the\r\nreal causes of these attacks on his friends were petty political\r\nintrigues--the ‘Liberal’ party in Cadiz was trying to secure its own\r\ndomination by evicting those who might be considered ‘Serviles’ or even\r\n‘Moderates’ from positions of power[726]. He had resolved not to bring\r\nthe relations between himself and the Regency to a crisis, by making a\r\nformal demand for the restoration of Castaños and Giron to their posts.\r\nHe wrote indeed to the Minister of War to say that he considered that\r\nhe had been ‘most unworthily treated’ and that there were limits to\r\nhis forbearance, but he avoided an open rupture, and waited for the\r\nRegency to take the next step. He wrote, however, to his brother, the\r\nAmbassador at Cadiz, that he ought to call together in private all the\r\nmore sensible and sound members of the Cortes, and to warn them of\r\nthe pernicious effects of this last move: unless they wished to see\r\nhim resign the position of Generalissimo, given him only six months\r\nback, they must bring pressure on their government--‘they have it in\r\ntheir power to interfere if they still wish that I should retain the\r\ncommand[727].’\r\n\r\nBut this political trouble, ominous though it might be of friction in\r\nthe near future, was not the cause of Wellington’s failure to exploit\r\nto the utmost the effects of the battle of Vittoria. The real hindrance\r\nwas not the state of Spanish politics, but the posture of affairs in\r\nCentral Europe. The Armistice of Plässwitz had been signed on June\r\n4, and till it came to an end on August 11 there was a possibility\r\nof peace between Napoleon and his Russian and Prussian enemies, on\r\nterms which Great Britain would be unable to accept. Wellington was\r\nsent frequent dispatches by Lord Bathurst, to keep him abreast of the\r\nlatest developments in the Conferences, but inevitably it took a very\r\nlong time for news from Saxony to reach London and be transmitted to\r\nSpain. Now if Napoleon should succeed in making a separate peace with\r\nthe Allies, his first care would be to evict the British Army, if it\r\nshould have entered France in successful pursuit of King Joseph and\r\nhis demoralized host. Even if it should have taken Bayonne, crushed\r\nthe enemy’s field force, and made good way towards Bordeaux, it would\r\nhave no chance of standing against the enormous reserves that could be\r\ndrawn from Germany, with the Emperor himself at their head. Therefore\r\nit would be better to take up a good position on the line of the\r\nPyrenees, secured by capturing St. Sebastian and Pampeluna, than to\r\nmake an irruption into France, however brilliant the immediate results\r\nof such a move might be. Still ignorant on July 12 of the tendency of\r\nthe conferences at Dresden, Wellington wrote to the Secretary for War:\r\n‘My future operations will depend a good deal upon what passes in the\r\nNorth of Europe: and if operations should recommence there, on the\r\nstrength and description of the reinforcement which the enemy may get\r\non our front.... I think I can hold the Pyrenees as easily as I can\r\nPortugal. I am quite certain that I can hold the position which I have\r\ngot more easily than the Ebro, or any other line in Spain[728].’ In\r\nanother letter he explains that he is giving his army a few days of\r\nmuch needed rest, by the end of which he hopes not only to have heard\r\nof the fall of St. Sebastian, but of the results of the negotiations\r\nin Germany[729]. In a third he puts the matter in the clearest terms:\r\n‘Much depends upon the state of affairs in the North of Europe. If\r\nthe war should be renewed, I should do most good by moving forward\r\ninto France, and I should probably be able to establish myself there.\r\nIf it is not renewed, I should only go into France to be driven out\r\nagain. So I shall do my best to confine myself to securing what I\r\nhave gained[730].’ In a fourth he complains that many people, even\r\nofficers at the front, seem to think that after driving the French from\r\nthe frontiers of Portugal to the Pyrenees, he ought to invade France\r\nimmediately. ‘Some expect that we shall be at Paris in a month.’ But\r\nthough he entertained no doubt that he could enter France to-morrow,\r\nand establish the Army on the Adour, he could go no farther. For if\r\npeace were made by the Allies, he must necessarily withdraw into Spain,\r\nand the retreat, though short, would be through a difficult country and\r\na hostile population. So from what he could gather about the progress\r\nof negotiations in Germany, he had determined that it would be unsafe\r\nto think of anything in the way of an invasion of France[731].\r\n\r\nEverything therefore at present, and for many weeks to follow, depended\r\non the news concerning the Armistice. And the happy intelligence that\r\nit had come to an end, and that the war was renewed, with the Austrians\r\nadded to the Allied forces, only reached Wellington on September 7th.\r\nThe actual declaration of war by Austria took place on August 11, by\r\nwhich time the situation on the Spanish frontier had suffered many\r\nvicissitudes, for in the last fortnight during which the Armistice\r\nendured, there had taken place Soult’s desperate invasion of Spain, and\r\nall the bloody fighting known as the Battles of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we must return to July 1st, on which day Wellington had\r\nalready made up his mind that his present programme should be confined\r\nto bringing up his army to the Bidassoa and the Pyrenean passes, and\r\nundertaking the siege of St. Sebastian and the blockade of Pampeluna.\r\nHe was still not quite happy about the intentions of Clausel--he\r\ntrusted that the French General and his 15,000 men would retire to\r\nFrance by the pass above Jaca[732]. If he were to remain at Saragossa,\r\nand Suchet were there to join him, a tiresome complication would be\r\ncreated on his right rear--wherefore he kept sending letters to William\r\nBentinck, ordering him to keep Suchet busy at all costs, by whatever\r\nmeans might seem best to him[733]. It was not till July 16th that news\r\ncame that this danger had ended in the desired fashion, by Clausel’s\r\ncrossing the passes[734]. But whatever might happen in that direction,\r\nthere was still one point that had to be settled, before it could be\r\nconsidered that the allied army was established on a satisfactory line\r\nfor defending the Spanish frontier and covering the sieges of St.\r\nSebastian and Pampeluna. The French were still in possession of the\r\nBastan, the high-lying valley of the Upper Bidassoa, through which\r\nruns the main road from Pampeluna to Bayonne, by the Col de Velate,\r\nand the pass of Maya. This last corner of Spain must be cleared of the\r\ninvaders, or the crest of the Pyrenees was not yet secure. Accordingly\r\narrangements were made for marching the main body of the British Army\r\nto its destined positions through the Bastan, in order to sweep out the\r\nlingering enemy.\r\n\r\nA sufficient corps must be left to blockade Pampeluna: during the\r\noperations against Clausel this duty had been discharged by Hill’s\r\nand Silveira’s and Morillo’s troops. As these units had enjoyed five\r\ndays’ rest, while the remainder of the divisions had been marching\r\nhard in eastern Navarre, it was arranged that they should give over\r\nthe service of the blockade by sections to the returning columns as\r\neach came up. Wellington intended to transfer the whole affair in the\r\nend to a Spanish force, the ‘Army of Reserve of Andalusia’ under Henry\r\nO’Donnell, which had been occupied for the last week in the siege of\r\nthe forts of Pancorbo, after its very tardy arrival in the zone of\r\noperations. King Joseph, when lying at Burgos, had thrown a garrison of\r\n700 men into these forts, which command the high road to the Ebro, in\r\nthe vain hope of incommoding Wellington’s advance. But as the allied\r\narmy did not march by the Camino Real at all, but cut across by side\r\nroutes to Medina del Pomar, the precaution was useless, and cost the\r\nenemy a battalion. However, it was necessary to clear the defile,\r\nin order to open the easiest line of communication with Madrid, and\r\nO’Donnell was directed to capture the forts on his way north to join\r\nthe main army. He invested them on June 25, and stormed the lower\r\nand weaker fort of Santa Marta on the 28th. The upper fort of Santa\r\nEngracia was a veritable eagle’s nest, on a most inaccessible position:\r\nO’Donnell succeeded with great difficulty in getting six guns up to a\r\npoint on which they could bear on the work. But the reason why such\r\na strong post surrendered by capitulation two days later was not the\r\nartillery fire, but mainly lack of water, the castle well having run\r\nnearly dry, and partly the news of Vittoria. A small party of fugitives\r\nwho had escaped from the field by an incredible détour, corroborated\r\nthe claims made by the Spanish general when he summoned the place, and\r\nthe commandant (Major Durand of the 55th Line) surrendered with 650\r\nmen, 24 guns, and a good stock of ammunition on June 30th[735].\r\n\r\nOn getting these news Wellington, on July 2, ordered O’Donnell to come\r\nup at once, and take over the blockade of Pampeluna, for which his\r\nwhole force of 11,000 men would not be too great. For the fortress was\r\nlarge and strongly garrisoned. The King had brought up the number of\r\ntroops left to the Governor-General Cassan[736] to 3,600 men before\r\nleaving the place, and there were over eighty guns mounted on the\r\nwalls, though two outlying forts in the plain had been abandoned.\r\nWellington allowed nine days for the orders to reach O’Donnell, and for\r\nthe Army of Reserve to make the long march from Pancorbo to Pampeluna:\r\nas a matter of fact it took eleven. Meanwhile the fortress had to be\r\ncontained by troops from the main army, till the Andalusians should\r\ncome up--they were due on July 12th. The scheme adopted was that Hill\r\nshould collect the 2nd Division and Silveira’s Portuguese[737]--their\r\nusual contingent of auxiliaries--on the north side of Pampeluna on July\r\n1st, and march on July 2; the ground which he had held being taken\r\nover by the Light 3rd and 7th Divisions, returning from the chase of\r\nClausel. On the 3rd the 7th Division was to be relieved by the 4th, and\r\nto follow Hill. On the 5th the 6th Division (Clinton) would arrive, and\r\nrelieve the Light Division which would follow the 7th. The greater part\r\nof the cavalry was to be left behind in the plains, being obviously\r\nuseless in the Pyrenees except in small parties for exploration; but\r\neach of the marching divisions had a regiment attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe result of these arrangements was to leave three divisions (3rd,\r\n4th, 6th), and nearly all the cavalry, for the blockade of Pampeluna--a\r\nrather larger force than might have been expected[738]. Four divisions\r\n(2nd, Light, 7th, and Silveira’s Portuguese) moved out to clear the\r\nBastan, and to establish communications with Graham’s corps on the\r\nLower Bidassoa. If the French had been in good fighting trim, four\r\ndivisions would have been none too many for the task, more especially\r\nwhen it is remembered that they were advancing in three échelons,\r\neach separated from the next by a long day’s march. But Wellington\r\nreckoned that, although he had all Gazan’s and D’Erlon’s troops in\r\nfront of him--the presence of Reille’s on the Lower Bidassoa had\r\nbeen reported by Graham--they would have no artillery (since it had\r\nbeen lost at Vittoria), would be low in numbers, because they had\r\nnot yet gathered in their stragglers, and lower still in morale. His\r\nestimate was on the whole justified, for the operation was successfully\r\ncarried out; but it did not go off quite so easily as had been\r\nexpected. It should be mentioned that, on the bare chance that the\r\nFrench might make a movement from St. Jean-Pied-du-Port to disturb\r\nthe blockade of Pampeluna--an unlikely possibility--the 2nd Division\r\nhad detached Byng’s brigade to hold the pass of Roncesvalles, in\r\nconjunction with Morillo’s Spanish division. Hill therefore, leading\r\nthe march towards the Bastan, had only three of his four brigades with\r\nhim--Cameron’s[739], O’Callaghan’s[740], and Ashworth’s Portuguese. The\r\ntotal of the marching column, from front to rear, was about 22,000 men.\r\n\r\nTo understand the task set before Hill’s corps it is necessary to go\r\nback to the arrangements--if arrangements they can be called, for they\r\nwere largely involuntary--made by the French Head-quarters Staff during\r\nthe preceding week. After Reille’s divisions had turned off towards the\r\nBidassoa, and D’Erlon’s had retreated into the Bastan, the main body\r\nof the French Army--the four and a half infantry divisions of the Army\r\nof the South, with its own cavalry and the bulk of that of the Army of\r\nPortugal[741]--had taken the route of the Pass of Roncesvalles, and\r\nreached St. Jean-Pied-du-Port, in a state of complete confusion (June\r\n27), preceded by a vanguard of marauders several thousands strong, who\r\nswept the countryside of cattle and corn just as freely after they\r\nhad reached France as while they were still in Navarre. Behind the\r\ntroops who had kept to their eagles followed a rearguard of footsore\r\nstragglers and slightly wounded men, harassed till they came to the\r\nfrontier by bands of local guerrilleros. The whole mass was in a state\r\nof demoralization: the French peasantry had to flee to the hills with\r\nwhat they could carry--every house was plundered save those in which\r\na general or other officer of high rank had quartered himself[742].\r\nSt. Jean-Pied-du-Port was a small third-class fortress, garrisoned\r\nby a battalion of National Guards, not an arsenal or a dépôt. It was\r\nimpossible to reorganize an army there, or even to feed it for a few\r\ndays. The Army of the South rolled back on June 29th to the valleys of\r\nthe Nivelle and Nive, so as to be near the great magazines of Bayonne,\r\nwhich had always been the base from which the French forces in Spain\r\nwere supplied. There alone would it be possible to re-form it, and\r\nto re-equip it with all the guns and transport necessary to replace\r\nthe losses of Vittoria. Gazan left one division--that of Conroux--at\r\nSt. Jean, to block the pass of Roncesvalles: with the other three\r\nand a half divisions he arrived on July 1st at Ustaritz, St. Pée and\r\nEspelette in the valleys of the Nive and Nivelle, only twelve or\r\nfifteen miles from Bayonne. The cavalry was sent back still farther to\r\nthe line of the Adour.\r\n\r\nSoon after this there was a great reduction made in the mounted arm.\r\nOrders arrived from Germany that only the cavalry of the Army of the\r\nSouth was to remain on the frontier. Boyer’s dragoons of the Army of\r\nPortugal, Treillard’s dragoons of the Army of the Centre, and seven\r\nlight cavalry regiments of the Armies of Portugal and the North were\r\nto start off at once[743]. Napoleon in his Saxon campaign had been\r\nsuffering bitterly from a want of good cavalry, and had directed the\r\nKing to send these veteran regiments across France with all speed,\r\nwhatever might be the state of affairs in Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that if Wellington had chosen, on June 26th, to\r\nfollow Gazan across the Pyrenees, instead of turning aside to chase\r\nClausel, he could have done anything that he pleased with the enemy.\r\nBut this, for the reasons that we have detailed above--was not his game\r\nfor the moment. Hence the shattered Army of Spain had a few days in\r\nwhich to commence reorganization. The easiest thing was the replacement\r\nof the 151 cannon lost at Vittoria. Bayonne was a great artillery\r\nstorehouse, and the French gunners had brought away their teams, if\r\nthey had left all their pieces behind them. On July 6th General\r\nTirlet, the officer commanding the artillery of the united armies,\r\ncould report to the King that he had already served out 80 guns--33\r\neach to the Armies of Gazan and Reille, 10 to the Army of the Centre,\r\nand 4 to the mobile division of the Bayonne Reserve. By the end of the\r\nmonth he promised to have 120 or even 150 pieces ready, which would\r\ngive every division its battery, as well as a good reserve. And these\r\npledges were fulfilled--with help from the arsenals of Toulouse, Blaye,\r\nand La Rochelle. But the supply of caissons was for some time very low,\r\nand the wheeled transport for the train was much more difficult to\r\nprocure, requisitions on the Pyrenean departments being difficult to\r\nenforce, and slow to collect. As to food supply, the main difficulty\r\nwas that although there was a considerable accumulation of stores at\r\nBayonne, no one had ever contemplated the chance that 60,000 starving\r\nmen would be thrown on the resources of the dépôt in one mass. Much\r\nflour was there, but not enough ovens to bake it, or wagons to carry\r\nit to the troops lying fifteen or twenty miles out, on the Bidassoa or\r\nthe Nive. And these troops had lost all their own carts and fourgons.\r\nEven as much as a month later the army, reorganized in other respects,\r\nhad not got enough transport to carry more than a few days’ food, as\r\nMarshal Soult was to find.\r\n\r\nKing Joseph had left Pampeluna long before his troops, and taking a\r\nshort cut had reached St. Jean de Luz on June 28th, and set up his\r\nlast head-quarters there. He was painfully aware of the fact that his\r\ngreat brother would in all probability visit upon his head all his\r\ninevitable wrath for the results of the late campaign; but to the final\r\nmoment of his command he strove to exercise his authority, and busied\r\nhimself with the details of projected operations. He was at this moment\r\nsomewhat estranged from Marshal Jourdan, who had taken to his bed, and\r\nkept complaining that the generals would neither give him information\r\nnor take his orders, but confined themselves to making ill-natured\r\ncomments on the battle of Vittoria. The King, instead of relying on his\r\nadvice, asked council on all sides, and hovered between many opinions.\r\n\r\nIt is a sufficient proof of the incoherence of both Jourdan’s and\r\nJoseph’s military ideas, that at this moment they were thinking\r\nseriously of resuming the offensive and re-entering Spain. When\r\nhe received Clausel’s dispatches announcing his safe arrival at\r\nSaragossa, and the possibility of his junction with Suchet, the King\r\nwas fascinated for the moment with the idea of bringing Wellington to\r\na stand, by attacking his flank and rear in Aragon. This could only\r\nbe done by sending large reinforcements to Clausel, and so weakening\r\nthe main army. The real objection to this plan was that the troops\r\nwere in no condition to march, or indeed to fight, till they should\r\nhave had time for rest and reorganization. Jourdan, however, drew up\r\non July 5--the very day on which Wellington was beginning to drive\r\nGazan out of the Bastan--as we shall presently see--a memoir for the\r\nKing’s consideration, which laid out three possible policies. One was\r\nto advance with every unit that could move, against Graham, who was\r\nwrongly supposed to have only one British division with him. The second\r\nwas to march to relieve Pampeluna by Roncesvalles, after first calling\r\nin Clausel to help. The third was to accept the idea which lay at the\r\nbase of Clausel’s last dispatch, to leave 15,000 men on the Bidassoa\r\nto detain Graham, and to move the rest of the army by the Jaca passes\r\ninto Aragon. It was conceded that artillery could not go that way, and\r\nthat Clausel had none with him--but some guns might be picked up at\r\nSaragossa and from Suchet, and a very large body of troops would be\r\nplaced on Wellington’s flank. It is difficult to say which of the three\r\nschemes was more impracticable for the moment, as a policy for the\r\nstarving and demoralized Army of Spain.\r\n\r\nA more serious project, and one for which there would have been much to\r\nsay, if the French Army had been at this moment in a condition to feed\r\nitself, or to manœuvre, or to commit itself to an action which would\r\ninvolve the expenditure of more ammunition than the infantry could\r\ncarry in their pouches, was one for strengthening the front in the\r\nBastan. While this long valley was still retained, direct communication\r\nbetween Wellington’s main body about Pampeluna and the large detachment\r\nunder Graham on the Bidassoa was blocked. But the Bastan was occupied\r\nby the weakest section of the French forces, D’Erlon’s Army of the\r\nCentre, one of whose infantry divisions (Darmagnac’s) had been ruined\r\nat the battle of Vittoria, where it lost more men in proportion to its\r\nstrength than any other unit[744], while another--Casapalacios’ Spanish\r\ndivision--was disappearing rapidly by desertion. There were only left,\r\nin a condition to fight, the Royal Guards--a little over 2,000 men--and\r\nCassagne’s division, which had suffered no serious casualties in the\r\nrecent campaign. Clearly the Bastan and the numerous passes which\r\ndescend into it could not be held by 10,000 infantry, some of them in\r\nvery bad order, even though they might get some guns from the Bayonne\r\narsenal. Wherefore Joseph ordered D’Erlon to make over the defence of\r\nthe Bastan to the Army of the South, and to fall back to the line of\r\nthe Nivelle, where he should join Reille. Gazan was directed to take\r\nover charge of this important salient, with the whole of his army, save\r\nConroux’s division left at St. Jean-Pied-du-Port[745] (July 3).\r\n\r\nGazan, who had only reached the Nive two days before, whose troops\r\nhad not yet recovered from the starvation which they had suffered in\r\nthe march from Pampeluna to Ustaritz and Espelette, who had lost his\r\ntransport, and who had not yet received the 33 guns which had been sent\r\nhim from Bayonne (though he was told that they were just coming up),\r\nmade objections very rational in themselves to these orders. He said\r\nthat his troops must have food and guns, or they could not be expected\r\nto maintain their positions. He also remarked that it was exasperating\r\nthat he had not been told to march straight from St. Jean-Pied-du-Port\r\nto the Bastan by the direct pass at Ispegui, instead of being brought\r\nback two days’ march to the Nive, and then sent south again to the Maya\r\npass, only twelve miles from his starting-point[746].\r\n\r\nGazan started out, unwillingly and with many protests, from his\r\ncantonments on the Nive on the morning of July 3, sending one of his\r\ndivisions, Leval’s, by the inferior mountain road from Sarre on the\r\nNivelle to Etchalar and Santesteban in the western Bastan, the rest\r\nby the Maya pass to Elizondo, the chief road-centre in the eastern or\r\nupper Bastan. From these points they were to spread themselves out,\r\nand take over all the passes south and west from D’Erlon’s troops. The\r\ncommander of the Army of the Centre began to clear out his reserves\r\nnorthwards, and to arrange for the rapid departure of each advanced\r\nsection, as it should be relieved by the arrival of Gazan’s divisions.\r\nHe met his colleague on the way, handed over the charge to him, and\r\nthen rode down to make his report to Jourdan at St. Pée (July 5), where\r\nhe dropped the cheering remark that if the Army of the South did not\r\nreceive very heavy convoys of food at once, it would go to pieces of\r\nits own accord and quit the Bastan within a few days, as his own army\r\nhad eaten up the valley and no troops could live there[747].\r\n\r\nDarmagnac’s division and the Royal Guard had been relieved by Leval,\r\nwhile Cassagne’s first brigade was marching north by Elizondo, though\r\nhis second was still blocking the Col de Velate till Gazan’s troops\r\nshould arrive, when Wellington’s attack was delivered--at the most\r\nopportune of moments. Nothing could have been better for him than that\r\nthe enemy should have been caught in the middle of an uncompleted\r\nexchange of troops, before the incoming army had gained any knowledge\r\nof the ground. Moreover, though Gazan had double as many men with him\r\nas D’Erlon, they had not enjoyed the comparative rest which the Army\r\nof the Centre had gained since June 26th, but had been countermarching\r\nall the time, and were in a very dilapidated condition. Otherwise\r\nthere would have been much greater difficulty in driving them out of\r\nthe Bastan with the very moderate force that Wellington actually used.\r\nFor he was able to finish the business with four brigades--the three\r\nof the 2nd Division and one of Silveira’s--which formed the head of\r\nhis column. Of the rear échelons, the 7th Division, which started from\r\nPampeluna on the 4th, got up only in time to see the very end of the\r\ngame, and the Light Division were never engaged at all.\r\n\r\nAt noon on July 4th Cameron’s Brigade[748], forming the advanced guard\r\nof the 2nd Division, crossed the highest point of the Col de Velate,\r\nand ran into half a battalion of the 16th Léger. This was the rearguard\r\nof Braun’s brigade of Cassagne’s division, which was holding the\r\nvillage of Berrueta, a few miles down the northern slope of the pass,\r\nwaiting till it should be relieved by Maransin’s division from Gazan’s\r\narmy. This detachment was evicted from Berrueta and Aniz, and fell back\r\non Ziga, where the other battalion of its regiment was in position.\r\nThat village also was cleared, but Hill’s leading brigade then found\r\nitself in front of Maransin’s division marching rapidly up the road,\r\nwith other troops visible in a long column behind. Hill, seeing that he\r\nwas about to be involved in a serious fight with heavy numbers, began\r\nto deploy the rear brigades of the 2nd Division behind the ravine in\r\nfront of Aniz, as each came up, abandoning the recently taken Ziga.\r\nThe French, in the same fashion, gradually formed a long line on their\r\nside of the ravine, extending it eastward from the village and showing\r\ntwo brigades in front line and two in reserve on the heights of Irurita\r\nsome way behind.\r\n\r\nHill appears to have felt the French front in several places, but to\r\nhave desisted on discovering its strength. Skirmishing of a bloodless\r\nsort went on all the afternoon, each side waiting for its reserves to\r\ncome up. Before dusk Gazan had drawn in all Villatte’s division, which\r\nhad reached Santesteban earlier in the day, and the non-divisional\r\nbrigade of Gruardet, so that by night he had two complete divisions\r\nand two extra brigades concentrated--at least 13,000 men[749]. Behind\r\nHill there was only Da Costa’s brigade of Silveira’s division, which\r\nwas a full march to the rear: for Wellington had ordered A. Campbell’s\r\nbrigade--the other half of the Portuguese division--to take a different\r\nroute, that up the Arga river by Zubiri to Eugui, which goes by a bad\r\npass (Col de Urtiaga) into the French valley of the Alduides.\r\n\r\nHill’s position was a distinctly unpleasant one, since he had\r\nonly three brigades up in line, with another out of any reasonable\r\nsupporting distance, if the enemy should think fit to press in upon\r\nhim. The 7th Division was two marches away, while the Light Division\r\nwas still before Pampeluna; both were altogether out of reach. Owing to\r\nheavy losses at Vittoria, the three second division brigades can hardly\r\nhave numbered 6,000 bayonets[750]. Their commander very wisely waited\r\nfor the arrival of Wellington from the rear. Head-quarters that day had\r\nbeen at Lanz, on the road from Pampeluna to the Col de Velate.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief came up at about midday on the 5th, following in\r\nthe wake of Da Costa’s Portuguese, who were bringing up with them two\r\nbatteries of artillery--the first guns that either side had shown in\r\nthe Bastan. After looking at the French positions Wellington resolved\r\nto push on--this was a purely psychological resolve, for his numbers\r\ndid not justify any such a move; he relied on his estimate of the\r\nmorale of Gazan, and that estimate turned out to be perfectly correct.\r\n\r\nHill’s operations, till Wellington took over charge of the field, had\r\nbeen limited to cautious reconnaissances of the enemy’s flanks. But\r\nwith the change in command decisive action began: Cameron’s brigade\r\nwas sent out by the steep hillsides on the right to turn Gazan’s\r\nleft flank; O’Callaghan’s, with Ashworth’s Portuguese in support,\r\ncrossed the ravine in front of Aniz, and deployed on each side of\r\nthe road to attack his centre. If Gazan had stood to fight, and\r\nbrought up all his reserves, it is hard to see how he could have been\r\nmoved: indeed he ought to have scored a big success if he had dared\r\nto counter-attack--for Wellington had no reserves save Da Costa’s\r\nPortuguese brigade. But, like Murray at Tarragona, the French general\r\nhad been making himself dreadful pictures of the strength that might\r\nconceivably be in front of him. Three prisoners taken at Ziga on the\r\npreceding day had told him that they belonged to Hill’s corps--he\r\npresumed it complete in front of him, with all its six brigades,\r\ninstead of the actual three. Then a heavy column had come up at\r\nnoon--Da Costa’s brigade--Gazan judged it to be some fresh division\r\nfrom Pampeluna. In addition he had received a cry of alarm from Conroux\r\nat St. Jean-Pied-du-Port--that officer reported that on July 4 a\r\nSpanish corps was threatening his flank from the Val Carlos--this was\r\nno more than a reconnaissance thrown out by Morillo. Also he got news\r\nfrom the Alduides valley of the arrival of A. Campbell’s Portuguese\r\nbrigade at Eugui--he deduced from this information, joined to the\r\nreport about Morillo, a turning movement against his left flank, by\r\nforces of unknown but probably considerable strength. Lastly, by\r\ndrawing in Villatte’s division to his main body, he had left open a gap\r\non his right, between his own positions in front of Elizondo and those\r\nof Leval at Santesteban. He was seized with a panic fear lest another\r\nBritish column might pour into this gap, by the mountain roads leading\r\nfrom Lanz and Almandoz into the middle Bastan[751]. And, indeed,\r\nWellington had started the 7th Division on one of these passes, the\r\nPuerto de Arraiz--but it was still 20 miles away.\r\n\r\nAlready on the night of the 4th Gazan had written to the King that\r\nhe must ask for leave to make his stand at the Maya pass, rather\r\nthan to hold all the minor defiles which converge into the Bastan--a\r\ncomplicated system of tracks whose defence involved a terrible\r\ndissemination of forces. By noon on the 5th, having seen Wellington’s\r\narrival with Da Costa’s brigade, he made up his mind that if the\r\nenemy attacked him frontally it must be to engage his attention,\r\nwhile encircling columns closed in upon his flanks and rear, from the\r\nAlduides on the one side and the western passes on the other. When\r\nthe movement against his front began, his troops in the position by\r\nZiga retired, without waiting to receive the attack, and took cover\r\nbehind Villatte’s division, drawn up on the heights of Irurita. Hill\r\nhad to spend time in re-forming his lines before he could resume the\r\noffensive; but when he did so against Villatte’s troops, they gave\r\nway in turn, and retired behind Maransin’s division, which was now\r\nplaced above the village of Elizondo. In this way the enemy continued\r\nto retire by échelons, without allowing the pursuers to close,\r\nuntil by dusk he stood still at last at the Col de Maya, where he\r\noffered battle. Gazan was extremely well satisfied with himself, and\r\nconsidered that he had made a masterly retreat in face of overwhelming\r\nhostile forces. As a matter of fact he had been giving way, time after\r\ntime, to mere demonstrations by a force of little more than half his\r\nown strength--four weak brigades were pushing back his six. But he\r\nnever made a long enough stand to enable him to discover the very\r\nmoderate strength of the pursuers. The whole business was a field\r\nday exercise--the total casualties only reached a few scores on each\r\nside. Gazan’s elaborate narrative about the various occasions on which\r\nBritish vanguards were surprised to run into heavy fire, suffered\r\nheavily, and had to halt, find its best comment in the fact that the\r\ntotal loss of English and Portuguese during three days of petty combats\r\nwas only 5 officers and 119 men, and that this day, July 5, was the\r\nleast bloody of the three.\r\n\r\nWell satisfied to have manœuvred the enemy out of the Bastan without\r\nany appreciable loss to himself, Wellington accepted the challenge\r\nwhich the Army of the South offered him by halting on the Maya\r\npositions. But he waited for the 7th Division to come up, rightly\r\nthinking that the two British and two Portuguese brigades hitherto\r\nemployed were too weak a force, now that the enemy showed signs of\r\nmaking his final stand. The 7th Division, acting under the senior\r\nbrigadier, Barnes, for Lord Dalhousie had been left behind to conduct\r\nthe blockade of Pampeluna, had marched on the 4th, the day when\r\nHill was commencing to push the French north of the Col de Velate.\r\nWellington had intended from the first that it should take a route\r\nwhich would enable it to turn Gazan’s right: it went north from\r\nMarcalain, where it had concentrated on giving up its blockading work,\r\nby Lizaso, to the pass of Arraiz, by which it descended into the Bastan\r\non the 6th. It then occupied Santesteban, from which Leval’s division\r\nhad been withdrawn by Gazan at the same moment at which he fell\r\nback himself on to the pass of Maya. Pending its arrival Wellington\r\nremained halted in front of the French positions for the whole of the\r\n6th, filling the enemy with various unjustifiable fears; for they\r\nover-valued his strength, and credited him with much more ambitious\r\nprojects than those which he really entertained. This halt on the 6th\r\nseemed to them to cover some elaborate snare, while its real purpose\r\nwas only to allow him to make his next move with 14,000 instead of with\r\n8,000 men. The plan for the morning of the 7th was that Hill’s column\r\nshould attack the Maya positions in front, while the 7th Division\r\nshould cross the Bidassoa at Santesteban, and take a mountain road\r\nwhich would bring it out upon the flank of Gazan’s line, which rested\r\non the Peak of Atchiola. This would be a hard day’s march by a rough\r\ntrack, along interminable crests and dips. Meanwhile, on July 8th,\r\nanother British unit would come up: the Light Division was relieved at\r\nPampeluna by the 4th Division on the 5th, and following in the track of\r\nBarnes, Charles Alten was to be at Santesteban on the night of the 7th,\r\nand at the fighting front by the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe halt which Wellington imposed on his leading column upon July\r\n6th gave time for the French Higher Command to make an astounding\r\nseries of blunders. To discriminate between true and false reports is\r\none of the most difficult tasks for any general, and the faculty of\r\nmaking a correct decision after receiving a number of contradictory\r\ndata is undoubtedly one of the best tests of military ability. All\r\nmen may err--but greater errors have seldom been made in a day than\r\nthose of Jourdan and King Joseph on July 6th. They started, perhaps\r\nnaturally, with the leading idea that Wellington was about to undertake\r\nthe invasion of France on a grand scale. Where would the blow fall?\r\nGraham had been quiescent for some days on the Bidassoa, and it was\r\nobvious that the troops on his front were mainly Spaniards--the Army\r\nof Galicia and Longa’s Cantabrians were alone visible. Gazan, though\r\nmaking constant complaints that he was outnumbered and oppressed\r\nby a ‘triple force’, had not as yet accounted for anything but\r\nHill’s corps as present in his front. Where, then, was the rest of\r\nWellington’s army? The concentration of troops in front of Pampeluna\r\nhad been ascertained--what had become of them? Now Conroux at St.\r\nJean-Pied-du-Port kept sending in messages of alarm. Morillo’s\r\nreconnaissances had induced him to push most of his division forward\r\nto watch the passes in his front, and he reported Byng’s brigade\r\nat Roncesvalles as a considerable accumulation of British troops.\r\nThen came the news that A. Campbell’s Portuguese brigade had entered\r\nthe Alduides valley, by descending which it could cut in between\r\nConroux and the rest of the army. Probably it was the over-emphasis of\r\nConroux’s cries of warning which set the King and Jourdan wrong--but\r\nwhatever the cause, they jumped to the conclusion that the serious\r\ninvasion was to come on the inland flank--that Byng and Campbell were\r\nthe forerunners of a great force marching to turn their left, by\r\nRoncesvalles and the eastern passes. Acting on this utterly erroneous\r\nhypothesis, they issued a series of orders for the hasty transference\r\nof great bodies of troops towards St. Jean-Pied-du-Port. Leval’s\r\ndivision of the Army of the South--which had retired to Echalar after\r\nevacuating Santesteban--Cassagne’s and Darmagnac’s divisions of the\r\nArmy of the Centre--which had handed over the Bastan to Gazan and\r\nretired to St. Pée--and Thouvenot’s provisional division of troops of\r\nthe Army of the North[752], from the Lower Bidassoa, were all started\r\noff by forced marches to join Conroux at St. Jean-Pied-du-Port. Only\r\nReille with the four divisions of the Army of Portugal was left to\r\nface Graham[753], and Gazan was directed to hold the Maya positions\r\nwith Maransin’s and Villatte’s divisions and Gruardet’s brigade alone.\r\nThus, while Wellington was about to deliver his rather leisurely blow\r\nat the French centre, all the enemy’s reserves were sent off to their\r\nextreme left. Nothing could have been more convenient to the British\r\ngeneral, if he had attacked one or two days later on the Maya front,\r\nwhen the troops on the move would all have got past him on their way\r\nsouth-eastward. But as he made his assault the day after the King’s\r\norders were issued, it resulted that the marching columns were passing\r\njust behind the part of the enemy’s line at which he was aiming, so\r\nthat Gazan had more supports at hand than might have been expected.\r\nBut this was neither to the credit of the King, who had not intended\r\nto provide them, nor to the discredit of Wellington, who could not\r\npossibly have foreseen such strategical errors as those in which his\r\nenemy was indulging.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 7th Gazan was in battle order at Maya, with\r\nMaransin’s division and Gruardet’s brigade holding the pass, and the\r\nheights on each side of it from the hill of Alcorrunz on the west to\r\nthe rock of Aretesque on the east. Villatte’s division (commanded on\r\nthis day by its senior brigadier, Rignoux, for Villatte was sick)\r\nformed the reserve, on the high road to Urdax, behind the main crest.\r\nWellington’s simple form of attack was to send O’Callaghan’s brigade to\r\nturn the French left by a mountain road, Cameron’s brigade to seize the\r\npeak of Atchiola beyond his extreme right, so as to outflank Gazan on\r\nthat side, to demonstrate with the Portuguese and his two batteries in\r\nthe centre, and to wait for the crucial moment when the 7th Division,\r\non the march since the morning by the hill road from Santesteban to\r\nUrdax, should appear in the enemy’s rear. Then a general assault would\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nThe scheme did not work out accurately. The Portuguese demonstrated, as\r\nwas ordered. O’Callaghan’s brigade accomplished its turning movement,\r\nand got into contact with Remond’s brigade of Maransin’s division, on\r\nthe extreme French left at the rock of Aretesque. Cameron’s brigade\r\ntook the hill of Alcorrunz without difficulty, but was then held up\r\nby the bulk of Villatte’s division, which came up from the rear and\r\nheld the crest of the Atchiola with six battalions; it could not be\r\ndislodged. So far so good--the enemy was engaged all along the line and\r\nhad used up three-fourths of his reserve. But early in the afternoon a\r\ndense fog set in, and the 7th Division never appeared in the enemy’s\r\nrear. It had got involved in the darkness, lost its way, and wandered\r\nhelpless. Wherefore the other attacks were never pressed. ‘If the 7th\r\nDivision had arrived in time, and the sea fog had held off for an hour\r\nor two, we should have made a good thing of it,’ wrote Wellington to\r\nGraham[754]. ‘Our loss is about 60 wounded--on the other days; (4th and\r\n5th) there was a good deal of firing, but we sustained no loss at all.’\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of July 8 Gazan, after having written a most\r\ninsincere report concerning the skirmish of the preceding day, _combat\r\ndes plus opiniâtres_, in which he had checked the enemy with loss,\r\nabandoned the Maya positions before he was again attacked. He had\r\nthe impudence to write to Jourdan that he had only recoiled because\r\nHead-Quarters refused to send him any supports[755]. As a matter of\r\nfact the King had checked the progress of the troops marching to St.\r\nJean-Pied-du-Port, and was sending them straight to Urdax and Ainhoue,\r\nwhere all the four divisions arrived on the 8th, early in the day.\r\nIf Gazan had chosen to hold on to the pass he would have had 15,000\r\nmen added to his strength by the evening. But he went off at 6 a.m.,\r\nand Hill occupied the crest an hour later. Wellington was so far\r\nfrom intending any further advance that he wrote that afternoon to\r\nGraham that he was now at leisure to take a look at the whole line of\r\nthe Bidassoa down to the sea, and intended to pay his lieutenant a\r\nvisit. A day later he told Lord Bathurst that ‘the whole of our right\r\nbeing now established on the frontier, I am proceeding to the left to\r\nsuperintend the operations there’--which meant in the main the siege of\r\nSt. Sebastian. The troops which had been brought up to the Bastan took\r\nup permanent quarters--the Light Division at Santesteban, the 7th at\r\nElizondo, Hill’s two British brigades at the Maya positions, to which\r\nartillery was brought up, while Ashworth’s and Da Costa’s Portuguese\r\nwere set to guard the minor eastern passes which open from the Bastan\r\ninto the Alduides, or Val de Baygorri--the Col d’Ispegui and the Col\r\nde Berderis. They connected themselves with A. Campbell’s Portuguese\r\nbrigade, which watched the southern exit from that long French valley.\r\nCampbell, for his part, had to keep touch along the frontier with\r\nByng and Morillo in the Roncesvalles country. The 3rd, 4th, and 6th\r\nDivisions still lay round Pampeluna, anxiously expecting to be relieved\r\nby the Army of Reserve of Andalusia. But Henry O’Donnell, though\r\ndue on the 12th, did not appear and take over the blockade till the\r\n16th-17th. This delay began to worry Wellington a few days later,\r\nbut on the 8th-9th he was still content with the position of affairs,\r\nrightly judging that the enemy was in no condition to make a push in\r\nany direction, till he should have got his troops rested, his artillery\r\nreplaced, and his transport reorganized.\r\n\r\nOtherwise he could not have taken so lightly the fact that opposite the\r\nMaya positions the enemy had now accumulated six and a half divisions,\r\nexpecting to be attacked by columns descending from the Bastan within\r\nthe next few days. Joseph and Jourdan spent an immense amount of\r\nunnecessary pains in the hurried shifting of troops, during the short\r\nspace that intervened before the thunderbolt which was coming from\r\nGermany fell on their unlucky heads. But who, in their position, could\r\nhave guessed that a mainly political consideration was intervening,\r\nto prevent Wellington from undertaking that invasion of France which\r\nseemed his obvious military duty?\r\n\r\nOne last measure of precaution on their adversary’s part modified\r\nthe front at the end of the petty campaign of the Bastan--but by\r\nthat time Joseph and Jourdan were gone. On July 15th Wellington made\r\nup his mind that the defensive position on the lower Bidassoa, by\r\nwhich he was covering the siege of St. Sebastian, was not safe on\r\nits inland flank, where the French were still in possession of the\r\ntown of Vera, at the gorge of the Bidassoa, where it emerges from its\r\nhigh upland course in the Bastan. Vera and its bridge presented an\r\nobvious point of concentration for a force intending to trouble the\r\nright wing of Graham’s corps. Wherefore it was necessary to clear the\r\nenemy out of this point of vantage, and to shorten the line between\r\nHill in the Bastan and Giron on the lower Bidassoa. Uncertain as to\r\nwhether the French would make a serious stand or not, Wellington\r\nordered up large forces--the 7th Division and the newly-arrived Light\r\nDivision from Santesteban, Longa, and one brigade of Giron’s Galicians\r\nfrom the covering troops. But the enemy--Lamartinière’s division of\r\nReille’s army--offered only a rearguard action, and withdrew to the\r\nother side of the hills which separate the Bastan from the coast\r\nregion--abandoning the ‘Puertos’ or passes of Vera and Echalar. They\r\nfeared that the advance of the allied left centre might be the\r\nprelude to a general attack, and began to make preparations to receive\r\nit. But their anxiety disappeared when it became clear that Wellington\r\nonly wanted Vera and its defile, and had no further offensive purpose.\r\nThe Light Division occupied Vera: the 7th, extending to the right, took\r\nover the pass of Echalar and got into touch with Hill’s advanced guard\r\nat Maya.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _King Joseph at Mortefontaine_\r\n\r\n_from the portrait by Girardet_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVII: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEXIT KING JOSEPH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Wellington was pressing his victorious advance to the Ebro, the\r\nEmperor Napoleon had been so entirely engrossed in the management of\r\nhis own great campaign in Saxony that he had little or no time to\r\nspare for considering the affairs of Spain. King Joseph had continued\r\nto receive dispatches from Paris, which purported to set forth his\r\nbrother’s orders and commands. But, as he well knew, they were really\r\nthe compositions of the War-Minister Clarke, who, from the general\r\ndirections which the Emperor had left when departing for Germany,\r\nand such curt comments as intermittently came back from Dresden or\r\nWittenberg, used to construct lectures or critical essays, which he\r\ntried to make appropriate to the last news that came up from Spain. The\r\noriginal instructions were completely out of date, and no new general\r\nscheme of operations could be got out of Napoleon, who could only find\r\ntime to make commentaries of a caustic kind on any correspondence\r\nthat came from beyond the Pyrenees[756]. Clarke’s dispatches to the\r\nKing were quite useless, and they were often offensive in tone--it is\r\nclear that the minister took a personal pleasure in making sarcastic\r\nobservations on the conduct of the war in Spain, which he could foist\r\non King Joseph as his brother’s composition. They generally arrived\r\nat moments which made them particularly absurd reading--what could be\r\nmore annoying to the King than to be told that Wellington’s Army was\r\na wreck, and that there was little chance of the Allies taking the\r\noffensive, at the very moment when the French Head-Quarters was moving\r\never northward, pushed on by what seemed in the eyes of Joseph and\r\nJourdan to be overwhelming numbers? It was absurd to be given hints\r\non the defence of the Douro when the retreating host was already on\r\nthe Ebro, or lectures on the advantages of the line of the Ebro, when\r\nthe Pyrenees had already been crossed. The habit of Clarke, however,\r\nwhich most irritated the King, was that of corresponding directly\r\nwith the minor army-commanders in Spain, over the head of the nominal\r\ncommander-in-chief[757]. Joseph held very strongly to the opinion that\r\na main part of his disasters was due to Clarke’s dispatches to Clausel\r\nand Suchet, which gave those generals excellent excuses for ignoring\r\norders from Head-Quarters, and carrying out their own designs, under\r\npretence that they were more consonant with the Emperor’s intentions\r\nthan the directions which came to them from Madrid, Valladolid, or\r\nBurgos.\r\n\r\nBut the Emperor’s attention was at last attracted to Spain by a\r\ndisaster which could not be overlooked, or ignored as a passing worry.\r\nThe news of Vittoria reached him at Dresden on July 1--nine days\r\nafter the battle had been lost--forwarded by Clarke with imperfect\r\ndetails. For the minister could only transmit a second-hand narrative\r\nwritten by Foy, who had not been present at the battle, and Joseph’s\r\nfirst short note from Yrurzun, dated July 23rd, which concealed much\r\nand told little. There was, however, enough information to rouse the\r\nEmperor to wild rage. He had three weeks before (June 4) concluded the\r\narmistice of Plässwitz with the allied sovereigns, so that he was not\r\nentirely absorbed in the details of his own strategy, and could at\r\nlast find time to devote some attention to the affairs of Spain, whose\r\nconsideration he had been putting off from week to week all through\r\nthe last two months. His own situation was still perilous enough--he\r\nwas uncertain whether he could come to terms with Russia and Prussia,\r\ndespite of his recent victories. And the idea that Austria might be\r\nmeaning mischief, and not merely playing for the enviable position of\r\ngeneral arbitrator between the belligerents, was already present. But\r\nat least he was not wholly occupied by the strategical and tactical\r\nneeds of each day, and could turn to contemplate the Spanish campaign\r\nas part of the European crisis. The exasperating thing was not so much\r\nthat the Imperial arms had suffered a hideous affront, though this\r\nwas a not unimportant consideration, which might encourage Alexander\r\nand Frederick William III to renew the war. It was rather that the\r\nposition of Spain, as a counter in the negotiations which were going\r\non at Prague, was completely changed. On May 25th the Franco-Spanish\r\nkingdom of Joseph Bonaparte made an imposing appearance--Madrid was\r\nstill occupied, and a solid block of territory from the Esla to the\r\nGuadalaviar--more than half the Peninsula--showed on the map as part\r\nof the Napoleonic empire. On July 1 it was known that the King was a\r\nfugitive on the French border, that the Castiles, Leon, Navarre, and\r\nBiscay had all been lost, that Valencia would certainly, and Aragon\r\nprobably, go the same way within a week or two. The pretence that\r\nJoseph was King of Spain had suddenly become absurd. In continuing\r\nthe hagglings at Prague for a new European settlement, it would be\r\nludicrous to insist on the restoration to Madrid of a king whose only\r\npossessions beyond the Pyrenees were a few scattered fortresses. For\r\nCatalonia, it must be remembered, did not count as part of Joseph’s\r\nkingdom; it had been formally annexed to France by the iniquitous\r\ndecree of February 1812[758].\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter blow to the new Charlemagne to see the largest of his\r\nvassal-kingdoms suddenly torn from him, by a stroke dealt by an enemy\r\nwhom he affected to despise, while his attention had been distracted\r\nfor the moment to the Elbe and the Oder. The unexampled rapidity of\r\nthe campaign of Vittoria was astounding--there was nothing to compare\r\nwith it in recent military history, save his own overrunning of the\r\nPrussian monarchy in the autumn of 1806. Wellington’s army had crossed\r\nthe Tormes on May 26th--by June 26th King Joseph was a fugitive in\r\nFrance, and the main French Army of Spain was pouring back as a\r\ndisorganized rabble across the passes of the Pyrenees. The whole affair\r\nseemed incredible--even ludicrous[759]--the armies of King Joseph still\r\nappeared on the imperial muster-rolls as well over 100,000 strong, not\r\nincluding Suchet’s forces on the East Coast. It was only a month or so\r\nback that the Emperor had been comforting himself with the idea that\r\nWellington could not put 40,000 British troops in the field, and was\r\nno longer a serious danger[760]. Obviously the only explanation of the\r\ndisaster must be colossal incapacity in the French Higher Command in\r\nSpain, amounting to criminal negligence. That there might be another\r\nexplanation, viz. that a war could not be successfully conducted in\r\nthose pre-telegraphic days by orders sent from five hundred miles\r\naway, by dispatches liable to constant delay or loss, and by a\r\ncommander-in-chief much distracted by other business, hardly occurred\r\nto him[761]. His own system of managing the affairs of Spain, as has\r\nbeen set forth in many earlier pages of this book[762], was really the\r\nsource of all evil. His nominal transference of the supreme command\r\nto King Joseph had been a solemn farce, because he still permitted\r\ninterference by the minister at Paris, acting in his name, tolerated\r\nprivate reports from army-commanders, which were concealed from the\r\nKing, and refused to allow of the punishment of flagrant instances of\r\ndisobedience to his vicegerent’s commands.\r\n\r\nThis perhaps the Emperor could hardly be expected to see. The news of\r\nVittoria having arrived, a culprit had to be sought, and the culprit\r\nwas obviously King Joseph, who with a magnificent army at his disposal,\r\nand a good military situation, had allowed himself to be turned\r\nout of Spain by a contemptible enemy. It went for nothing that the\r\nunfortunate monarch had repeatedly asked for leave to abdicate, and had\r\ndemonstrated again and again that he was not allowed the real authority\r\nof a commander-in-chief. The blame must be laid on his shoulders, and\r\nhe must be disgraced at once--not with too great public scandal, for\r\nafter all he was the Emperor’s brother--but in the manner which would\r\nprove most wounding to his own feelings. ‘All the fault was his ...\r\nif there was one man wanting in the army it was a real general, and\r\nif there was one man too many with the army it was the King[763].’\r\nClarke was told to write to him a dispatch which not only superseded\r\nhim in command, and deprived him of even the services of his own Royal\r\nGuard, but put him under a sort of arrest. He was on no account to go\r\nto Paris. ‘The importance of the interests that are at stake in the\r\nNorth, and the effect that your Majesty’s appearance could not fail to\r\nproduce on public opinion--both in Europe at large and more especially\r\nin France--are so great, that the Emperor is constrained to issue\r\nhis formal orders that your Majesty should stop at Pampeluna or St.\r\nSebastian, or at least come no further than Bayonne.... Extraordinary\r\nprecautions have been taken to prevent the newspapers from mentioning\r\neither the event of June 21st [the battle of Vittoria], or the\r\nEmperor’s decision concerning your Majesty.... It is at Bayonne, where\r\nthe Emperor foresees that your Majesty has probably arrived, that\r\nhis further intentions will be signified, when he has acquired full\r\ninformation as to the recent events. It is his definite order that your\r\nMajesty should come no further into France, nor most especially to\r\nParis, under any pretext whatever. For the same reasons no officer of\r\nyour Majesty’s suite, and none of the Spanish exiles, must come beyond\r\nthe Garonne. They may be directed to establish themselves at Auch.’\r\n\r\nBut though this was bad enough, the greatest insult in King Joseph’s\r\neyes was that he was directed to hand over the command of the army and\r\nhis own Guards to his old enemy Soult, whose expulsion from Spain he\r\nhad procured with so much difficulty, and whom he had denounced to the\r\nEmperor as selfish, disloyal, disobedient, and perjured, ‘the author\r\nof that infamous letter found at Valencia[764]’ which had accused\r\nthe King of conspiring with the Cadiz Cortes against the interests\r\nof his own brother. When Soult had returned from Spain the Emperor\r\nhad decided that all the accusations against him were frivolous, ‘des\r\npetitesses.’ He might not be an amiable character--how many of the\r\nmarshals were?--but he had ‘the only military brain in the Peninsula’.\r\nHe was not given the command of any of the army corps in Saxony, nor\r\nany administrative post of importance, but kept at Head-Quarters,\r\nat the Emperor’s disposition, for two whole months. Apparently even\r\nbefore the news of Vittoria arrived, his master had thought of sending\r\nhim back to Spain, but had postponed the scheme, because he did not\r\ndesire an open breach with his brother. But when Joseph’s _débâcle_\r\nwas announced, the Marshal received orders to leave Dresden at a few\r\nhours’ notice, to call upon Clarke at Paris on the way, in order to\r\npick up the latest military information, and then to assume the command\r\nat Bayonne at the earliest possible moment. He was posted up in all the\r\nEmperor’s latest political and military schemes--even, as it seems,\r\nentrusted with the secret that if matters went very badly it might be\r\nnecessary to open secret negotiations with the Cadiz Regency, on the\r\nbase that the Emperor might restore Ferdinand VII to his subjects, and\r\nwithdraw all his troops from Spain, if the Cortes could be persuaded\r\nto make a separate peace, and to repudiate the British alliance[765].\r\nIt seems to have escaped Napoleon’s observation that the return of the\r\nultra-conservative and narrow-minded Ferdinand would be the last thing\r\ndesired by the Liberal party now dominant in the Cortes. But all the\r\ndisappointments of the treaty of Valençay were still in the far future.\r\n\r\nAmong the instructions entrusted to Soult, for use if they should prove\r\nnecessary, was a warrant authorizing him to put Joseph under arrest,\r\nif he should openly flout his brother’s orders to halt at Bayonne,\r\nand should show any intention of setting out for Paris. This warrant\r\nhad actually to be employed--the most maddening insult of all in the\r\neyes of the King--it made his treacherous enemy into his jailer, as he\r\ncomplained.\r\n\r\nJoseph received the first notice of his supersession from the mouth\r\nof the Senator Roederer, who had been sent off by Clarke a few hours\r\nin advance of Soult, in order that there might not be any scandalous\r\nscene, such as might have occurred if the Marshal had presented himself\r\nin person to inform the King of his fate. Roederer had served under\r\nJoseph as King of Naples, was friendly to him, and broke the unpleasant\r\ntidings as tactfully as he could. The results were what might have\r\nbeen expected--the unfortunate monarch said that he had realized that\r\nhe must go, that he was already drafting another act of abdication.\r\nBut it was an insult to send Soult to take over the command, after\r\nall the proofs of the Marshal’s perversity and disloyalty which he\r\nhad forwarded to the Emperor. He did not object to being deposed,\r\nor imprisoned, or put on his trial for treason, but he did object to\r\nbeing made the prisoner of Soult. ‘As often as he got on this topic his\r\nMajesty grew quite frantic[766].’\r\n\r\nBut when Soult presented himself next morning there was no scene.\r\nThe King handed him over his papers and dispatches, and said that he\r\nintended to establish himself in a country house just outside the gates\r\nof Bayonne (July 12). Three days later, however, he made a sudden and\r\nsecret departure, and was well on the way to Bagnères de Bigorre before\r\nhis escape was discovered. He had to be pursued, stopped by force, and\r\nshown the imperial warrant which authorized Soult to put him under\r\narrest. For eight days he was a prisoner at the Château of Poyanne,\r\nwhen a dispatch arrived from Dresden, in which the Emperor said that\r\nhe might be allowed to retire to his own estate of Mortefontaine, on\r\ncondition that he saw no one, and never visited Paris [July 24]. If he\r\nshould make himself a centre of intrigues, and should fail to realize\r\nthat he was in disgrace, the Minister of Police had orders to imprison\r\nhim[767].\r\n\r\nAnd thus Joseph disappears from the purview of students of the\r\nPeninsular War, though he was to have one more short moment of\r\nnotoriety in the following spring, when he was made the nominal head\r\nof the Council of Regency, which purported to govern France for a few\r\nweeks, before the Northern Allies forced their way into the French\r\ncapital. He did not shine in that capacity, and would have done better\r\nto content himself with escaping the notice of the world in the\r\nsemi-captivity to which his brother had condemned him in July 1813. But\r\nJoseph, however much he might deny the impeachment, loved a prominent\r\nplace, however incapable he might be of filling it in a competent\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is the secret of his whole unfortunate career. The chance\r\nwhich made him the brother of Napoleon put within his grasp ambitions\r\nwith which his very moderate talents could not cope. He was by no\r\nmeans a bad man: the Spaniards would gladly have drawn him as a tyrant\r\nor a monster, if it had been possible to do so; but had to content\r\nthemselves with representing him as a ludicrous and contemptible\r\ncharacter, ‘Pepe Botellas’[768], a comic-opera king, too much addicted\r\nto wine and women, and tricked by his courtiers and mistresses. There\r\nseems no reason to suppose that the charge of inebriety had any\r\nparticular foundation; but Joseph--long separated from his wife by\r\nthe chances of war--undoubtedly sought consolations in more than one\r\nother quarter at Madrid. His amatory epistles and souvenirs, captured\r\nin his carriage at Vittoria, provoked a smile and a caustic remark\r\nfrom Wellington. As to the taunt that he was continually cheated and\r\nexploited by those about him, there is no doubt that the unfortunate\r\nKing was possessed of the delusion that his personal charm and affable\r\nmanners won all hearts; he wasted much time in cajoling every person of\r\nany importance with whom he came in contact, and had many sad moments\r\nof disillusion, when he discovered that supposed friends had failed\r\nhim. His most persistent and dangerous error was that he imagined that\r\nhe could win over the Spaniards to his cause, by generous treatment and\r\nemotional speeches. For years he went on enlisting in his ‘national\r\narmy’ every prisoner who was willing to save himself a tramp to a\r\nFrench prison, by taking an easy oath of allegiance. When given arms\r\nand uniforms they deserted: first and last Joseph enlisted 60,000\r\nSpaniards in his leaky regiments--about 1,500 crossed the Bidassoa with\r\nhim at the moment of his fall. With those above the rank and file he\r\nwas a little more successful, because officers and politicians were\r\nmarked men, when once they had risked their necks by forswearing their\r\nallegiance to Ferdinand VII. They knew that there would be no such easy\r\npardon for them as was granted to the common soldier. There had been\r\nmoments of intense depression for the Spanish cause, such as those\r\nfollowing the capture of Madrid in December 1808, and the invasion of\r\nAndalusia in 1810, at which many timid or selfish souls had despaired\r\nof the game, and had taken service with the adversary. Having once done\r\nso it was impossible to go back--hence the King, when his star began to\r\nwane, was overloaded with hundreds, and even thousands, of downhearted\r\nand pessimistic dependants, who had no faith in his ultimate triumph,\r\nyet still hung on to his skirts, and petitioned for the doles which\r\nhe was no longer able to give them. Few served him zealously--those\r\nwho did were in the main adventurers as destitute of morality as of\r\nnational feeling, who strove for their own profit rather than their\r\nmaster’s--his prefects and intendants had villainous reputations for\r\nthe most part.\r\n\r\nThough vain and self-confident, Joseph was entirely lacking in\r\nbackbone--he endured all the Emperor’s insults and taunts without any\r\nreal feeling of resentment, though he protested loudly enough. Unlike\r\nhis brothers, Lucien and Louis, he never dared to set his will against\r\nNapoleon’s--his threatened abdications never became realities. He\r\npretended that his submission was the result of loyalty and brotherly\r\naffection--in reality he had an insufficient sense of righteous\r\nindignation and self-respect, and an exaggerated love of royalty--even\r\nof its shadow. An intelligent French observer summed up his character\r\nin the following curious phrases:\r\n\r\n‘The King’s most striking characteristic is his easy temper. It does\r\nnot come from a generous heart or a real magnanimity, but from a facile\r\ndisposition and a total absence of decision. He has not the courage to\r\nrefuse to do things which his own reason condemns, and is often guilty\r\nof acts which he himself acknowledges to be unwise. At bottom he is an\r\nhonest man, but he has not the firmness to maintain his principles if\r\nhe is pressed and harried. Tiresome solicitation may induce him to cast\r\naside principle and act like a rogue. His greatest hobby is a belief in\r\nhis own _finesse_--a great perspicacity in discovering the secret and\r\nselfish motives of those about him. He often gives them credit for more\r\nMachiavellian ingenuity than they really possess. He does not always\r\nwithdraw his favour from those whom he has discovered cheating him,\r\nbut rejoices in making them feel that he has found out their private\r\ndesigns. He is incapable of owning that he has done an injustice:\r\nwhen he discovers that he has wronged one of his followers, he shirks\r\nmeeting him, and tries to get rid of him by circuitous methods. Hence\r\nhe often persists in acts of injustice, because he is ashamed of\r\nconfessing himself to have been mistaken.’\r\n\r\nThe natural result of this lack of moral backbone was that Joseph was\r\nsystematically disobeyed and cheated. Very little was to be feared\r\nfrom his anger, much could be got by threatening or worrying him. It\r\nis true that he was much handicapped by the constant interference\r\nof the Emperor, and even of the French Minister of War, in all his\r\nattempts to create a Spanish administration, and to co-ordinate the\r\nefforts of the various armies in the Peninsula. Nevertheless there\r\nwas much truth in his brother’s savage comments on his character--‘he\r\ncannot get himself obeyed’--‘he has neither military talent nor\r\nadministrative ability’--‘he does not know how to draw up accounts’--he\r\n‘cannot command an army himself, but he can prevent other and more\r\ncompetent people from doing so’--‘the greatest moral error is to take\r\nup a profession which one does not understand: that the King was not\r\na professional soldier was not his fault, but he was responsible for\r\ntrying to be one[769].’ To this last and perfectly just remark Joseph\r\ncould have made an unanswerable reply, by asking who was responsible\r\nfor the promotion of a person who was not, and never could be, a\r\nprofessional soldier, to the post of Commander-in-Chief of all the\r\nArmies of Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to concede to this unlucky prince his good qualities:\r\nhe was never cruel--no usurper ever shed so little blood: he was\r\na good master to many ungrateful servants: he was courteous and\r\nconsiderate, liberal so far as his scanty means allowed, and interested\r\nin literature and art. Unfortunately his artistic tastes brought him\r\nonly ridicule. He was greatly given to pulling down slums and eyesores\r\nin Madrid, but never had the money to replace them by the stately\r\nbuildings which he had designed--his good intentions were only shown\r\nby empty spaces--whence the people called him _El rey Plazuelos_. This\r\nwas rather to his credit than otherwise--less so the interest in art\r\nshown by his eleventh-hour pilfering of the best pictures of the Madrid\r\nGalleries, of which Wellington recaptured a selection at Vittoria.\r\nTo sum him up in a single phrase, Joseph Bonaparte was the mildest\r\nmannered man who ever stole a crown--or rather acted as receiver of a\r\ncrown stolen by his ruthless brother.\r\n\r\nWith King Joseph his Chief-of-the-Staff went into the depths of\r\ndisgrace. Napoleon wrote that he never wanted to hear of Jourdan\r\nagain. He must go into complete retirement at his estate of Coudray\r\nnear Orleans. He was cut down to the strictest minimum of retired\r\npay--not over 20,000 francs a year[770], which left him in miserable\r\nstraits--for he had a large family, and he was honest, and had never\r\nfeathered his nest like other marshals. The only notice to be taken of\r\nhim was that he was to be ordered to draw up a memorandum explaining\r\nhow the battle of Vittoria had been fought and lost--if any explanation\r\nwere possible[771]. But Napoleon, when he pardoned Joseph a few months\r\nlater, pardoned Jourdan also. He was given the command of the Rouen\r\nMilitary District, where he did competent administrative work in the\r\nspring of 1814, so far as his broken health permitted. It is surprising\r\nto find that, with all his ailments, this worthy old officer--the\r\nCassandra of the great drama of 1812-13--survived till 1833, when he\r\ndied, after having been for many years Governor of the Invalides.\r\nHis military memoirs, first published in a scattered and incomplete\r\nform in Ducasse’s _Life and Correspondence of Joseph Bonaparte_, and\r\nafterwards in a better shape so late as 1908, form one of the best\r\ncritical commentaries on the Peninsular War. As a purveyor of hard\r\ntruths concerning his imperial master, and the marshals who were his\r\ncolleagues in Spain, Jourdan has no rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF THE PYRENEES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF ST. SEBASTIAN. FIRST PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving pushed his whole front line up to the French border, from Giron\r\nat Irun, hard by the ocean, to Byng, far inland on the watershed of the\r\nhistoric Pass of Roncesvalles, Wellington turned his attention to the\r\nsiege of St. Sebastian, on which he intended to press hard and rapidly,\r\nwhile Pampeluna was to be left for the present to the slower process\r\nof blockade and starvation. He had no intention of pushing forward\r\ninto France till the result of the negotiations in Germany should be\r\nknown. He was kept informed of the doings at Dresden from time to time,\r\nbut occasionally bad weather in the Bay of Biscay delayed the courier\r\nfrom Downing Street, and there was an interval of many days, during\r\nwhich the absence of political information began to cause him anxiety.\r\nOn the whole, as he was informed, it was probable that the war would\r\nbe renewed; but the intentions of Austria were still suspect, and the\r\ndanger of a separate peace in the North never ceased to disturb him\r\nuntil hostilities actually recommenced in the middle of August. On\r\nJuly 10th he had still many weeks to wait, before the news arrived\r\nthat Metternich had broken with Napoleon--after a certain famous and\r\nstormy interview--and that Austria had come into the Grand Alliance.\r\nMeanwhile he intended to make his defensive position on the Pyrenean\r\nfrontier sure, by the capture of the fortresses. It is curious to note\r\nthat Napoleon understood and approved from the military point of view\r\nof this policy. On Aug. 5 he wrote to his minister Maret from Dresden,\r\n‘it is certain that Lord Wellington had a very sensible scheme: he\r\nwished to take St. Sebastian and Pampeluna before the French Army could\r\nbe reorganized. He supposed that it had suffered more heavily than was\r\nactually the case, and thought that more than a month would be required\r\nto refurnish it with artillery[772].’ This was a guess that came very\r\nnear the truth, though the Emperor could not know that the cause of the\r\nBritish general’s delay was mainly political and not military.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Wellington that the astounding triumph of Vittoria\r\nhad put him in a position to dictate his own policy to the Ministry\r\nat home. For Lord Bathurst and Lord Liverpool had been sending him\r\nsuggestions which filled him with grave apprehensions. Before the\r\nnews of Vittoria reached London, the War Minister had ‘thrown out for\r\nconsideration’ two most inept projects. If the French in Spain had\r\nbeen driven beyond the Ebro, would it not be possible to ‘contain’\r\nthem for the future by Spanish and Portuguese armies, and to bring\r\nround Wellington himself and the bulk of his British troops to Germany,\r\nleaving only a small nucleus to serve as a backbone for the native\r\nlevies of the Peninsula? The appearance of Wellington with 40,000 of\r\nhis veterans on the Elbe would probably induce the Allies to appoint\r\nhim Generalissimo against Napoleon, and if Great Britain had the chief\r\ncommand in Germany she could dictate the policy of the Coalition. But\r\nsupposing that the war was not resumed in Central Europe, and that a\r\ngeneral peace was negotiated, would it be possible or expedient to\r\nallow the Emperor to retain the boundary of the Ebro for the French\r\nEmpire, on condition that he yielded to the demands of the Allies in\r\nother parts of the Continent? Or would Wellington guarantee that in\r\nthe event of a Peace from which Great Britain stood out, he would be\r\nable to maintain himself in Spain and Portugal, as in 1810 and 1811,\r\neven though Napoleon had no other enemies left, and could send what\r\nreinforcements he pleased across the Pyrenees?[773]\r\n\r\nEven after the great event of June 21st had become known in London,\r\nwe find the Prime Minister repeating some of Lord Bathurst’s most\r\nabsurd suggestions. He wrote in a tentative and deferential style,\r\nto set forth the hypothesis that it might be possible to so fortify\r\nthe Spanish frontier that it might be held by a small British force\r\naided by Spanish levies, ‘applying the principle upon which the Lines\r\nbefore Lisbon were formed to the passes of the Pyrenees’; and he\r\ninquired whether the warlike Navarrese and Biscayans could not defend\r\nthis new Torres Vedras, if backed by a small force--20,000 or at most\r\n30,000--veteran Anglo-Portuguese troops[774]. If this could be done\r\nLord Liverpool obviously hoped great things from the effect of the\r\nappearance of Wellington, with his new prestige and the bulk of his\r\nvictorious battalions, in Central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe recipient of these ill-advised suggestions would have nothing to\r\ndo with them. When on July 12th he got Bathurst’s dispatch of June\r\n23rd, he replied that, being the servant of the State, he must obey\r\nany orders given him by the Prince Regent and the Ministry, but that\r\nhe saw no profit in going to Germany, which he did not know, and where\r\nhe was not known, whereas in Spain he had a unique advantage in ‘the\r\nconfidence that everybody feels that what I do is right’. ‘Nobody\r\ncould enjoy that same advantage here--while I should be no better\r\nthan another in Germany. If any British army should be left in the\r\nPeninsula, therefore, it is best that I should remain with it.’ As to\r\nmaking any general peace which left the French the line of the Ebro as\r\na frontier, that problem had been settled by the battle of Vittoria. ‘I\r\nrecommend you not to give up an inch of Spanish territory; I think I\r\ncan hold the Pyrenees as easily as I can Portugal.’ It would really be\r\nbetter to have Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain (considering how ready\r\nall Bonapartes are to break away from their brother), than to have\r\nFerdinand back with the Ebro as his frontier. ‘In the latter case Spain\r\nwould inevitably belong to the French[775].’\r\n\r\nAs to the ridiculous idea of fortifying the Pyrenean passes in the\r\nstyle of the Lines of Torres Vedras, Wellington speaks with no\r\nuncertain sound. ‘I do not think we could successfully apply to the\r\nfrontier of Spain the system on which we fortified the country between\r\nLisbon and the sea. That line was a short one, and the communications\r\neasiest and shortest on our side. The Pyrenees are a very long line;\r\nthere are not fewer than seventy passes through these mountains, and\r\nthe better communications, so far as I have been able to learn, are on\r\nthe side of the enemy. We may facilitate defence by fortifying some of\r\nthe passes: but we can never make in the Pyrenees what we made between\r\nthe Tagus and the sea[776].’\r\n\r\nIt looks as if Lord Liverpool, in serene ignorance of local geography,\r\nimagined the Pyrenees to be a simple line of precipices, pierced by\r\na limited number of passes, which could be sealed up with walls, in\r\nthe style in which Alexander the Great in the mediaeval romance dealt\r\nwith the ‘Caucasian Gates’. For we cannot suppose that even the most\r\nunmilitary of politicians could have conceived it possible to build\r\nsomething like the Great Wall of China for several hundred miles, along\r\nthe whole frontier from Fuenterrabia to Figueras. Yet this is what\r\nhis proposal, if taken literally, would have meant; and Wellington,\r\nto show its absurdity, gave the total number of passes available for\r\nmules or pedestrians between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean.\r\nThose by which guns or wheeled transport could pass were (of course)\r\nno more than five or six--but there would be no finality in sealing\r\nup these few: for the enemy could turn the flanks of any of them with\r\ninfantry scrambling up accessible slopes--as Soult indeed did during\r\nthe battles of the Pyrenees, only a month after Lord Liverpool had made\r\nhis egregious suggestion--or as Napoleon had done at the Somosierra in\r\nthe winter of 1808.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to the Prime Minister’s proposal to hand over the\r\ndefence of the Pyrenees to Spanish armies backed by a mere 20,000\r\nAnglo-Portuguese, Wellington replied that the Spanish Government had\r\nshown itself most consistently unable to feed, pay, and clothe its\r\narmies, or to provide the transport which would make them mobile. In\r\nJune 1813 there were 160,000 men on the Spanish muster rolls, but only\r\na third of that number at the front and actively engaged with the\r\nFrench, even when all troops in the Pyrenees, Aragon, and Catalonia\r\nwere reckoned up. To trust the defence of the frontier to a government\r\nwhich could not move or feed more than a third of its own troops,\r\nwould be to invite disaster. The best way to help the Spaniards was\r\nnot to ask for more men, but to improve their finances, so that they\r\nshould be able to employ a greater proportion of their already existing\r\ntroops. As things stood at present, it would be insane to request them\r\nto take over the main burden of the war. ‘It is my opinion that you\r\nought not to have less than 60,000 British troops in the field, let the\r\nSpaniards have what numbers they may[777].’\r\n\r\nWellington had by this time established himself in such a commanding\r\nposition that the ministers had to accept his decision--however much\r\nthey would have liked to move him round to Germany, and to press for\r\nhis appointment to the unenviable position which Prince Schwarzenberg\r\noccupied during the second campaign of 1813. The best proof of the\r\nwisdom of his determination to remain in the Peninsula was that the\r\nFrench, far from adopting a defensive policy, resumed the offensive\r\nunder Soult within a few weeks. It would be an unprofitable, as also a\r\ndismal, task to consider what would have happened during the battles\r\nof the Pyrenees had Soult been opposed, not by Wellington and his old\r\narmy, but by a Spanish host under O’Donnell or Freire, backed by two or\r\nthree Anglo-Portuguese divisions.\r\n\r\nControversy with Lord Bathurst on general principles was only one of\r\nWellington’s distractions during the middle weeks of July: he was\r\nat the same time carrying on an acrimonious correspondence with the\r\nSpanish Minister of War, concerning the removal of Castaños and Giron\r\nfrom their posts, and enduring many controversial letters from Sir\r\nJohn Murray regarding the Tarragona fiasco. Murray had realized the\r\ndisgust which his wretched policy had roused, alike in the army and\r\nin the British public, and was endeavouring to justify himself to his\r\ncommander-in-chief by long argumentative epistles. Wellington refused\r\nto commit himself to any judgement, and agreed with the ministers at\r\nhome that a court martial would be required[778]. He suggested to the\r\nauthorities at the Horse Guards that Murray should be charged firstly\r\nwith making no proper arrangements to raise the siege of Tarragona or\r\nto bring off his guns, secondly with having disobeyed the clause of his\r\ninstructions which bade him return at once to Alicante if he failed in\r\nCatalonia, and thirdly with having betrayed General Copons, by bringing\r\nhim down to the coast and then absconding without giving any proper\r\nwarning of his departure[779]. After mature reflection, however, he\r\nadvised that the third charge should be dropped, not because it was\r\nunjustified, but because there would be great inconvenience in bringing\r\nCopons or his representatives to bear witness at a British court\r\nmartial, when they were wanted in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nBut all this correspondence, and much more on less important\r\nsubjects, did not prevent Wellington from paying his promised visit\r\nto General Graham, to inspect in person the allied positions on the\r\nlower Bidassoa, and to supervise the arrangements for the siege of\r\nSt. Sebastian, which indeed required supervision, for already it was\r\nevident that things were not going so well as might have been hoped in\r\nthis direction (July 12).\r\n\r\nThe first impression made on the observer by the fortress of St.\r\nSebastian is that it is an extremely small place. This is true--though\r\nit is also true that its effect is somewhat dwarfed by its immense\r\nsurroundings--the limitless expanse of the Ocean on one side, and the\r\nhigh and fantastic peaks of the Jaizquibel, the Peña de la Haya, and\r\nthe Four Crowns, which have just been passed by the traveller coming\r\nfrom the side of Bayonne. The fortress consists of a lofty sandstone\r\nrock, as steep as Edinburgh Castle and 400 ft. high, beaten on three\r\nsides by the sea, and united to the land by a low sandy isthmus about\r\n900 yards long. There was an old castle called La Mota, on the summit\r\nof the rock, which is named Monte Urgull, with three modern batteries\r\non its southern or landward face[780], which is very steep and only\r\naccessible at two points by winding roads. But these were not the main\r\ndefences of the place, which lay lower down. The town of St. Sebastian\r\nwas built on the lower ground below the rock, extending from sea to\r\nsea and occupying about a third of the isthmus, the rest of which was\r\nbroken sandy ground about 400 yards broad. At the southern neck of the\r\nisthmus was a hill crowned by the large monastery of San Bartolomé,\r\nwhich the French held as an outwork at the beginning of the siege. The\r\nspace between this hill and the wall of the town, now thickly packed\r\nwith the hotels and avenues of a fashionable seaside resort, was in\r\n1813 waste ground dotted with a few isolated houses and gardens, which\r\nthe governor was busily engaged in levelling when the blockading force\r\narrived. At two points there was a sufficient accumulation of buildings\r\nto form a small suburb. One group was at the head of the bridge across\r\nthe river Urumea, which joined the peninsula to the eastern mainland;\r\nthis was named Santa Catalina, from a chapel of that saint which\r\nlay in it. The other, called (for a similar reason) San Martin, was\r\nimmediately at the foot of the hill of San Bartolomé. The bridge had\r\nbeen blown up by the French when the Spaniards first appeared, and the\r\nsuburbs set on fire, but their roofless and partly fallen houses still\r\ngave a good deal of cover.\r\n\r\nThe land-front of St. Sebastian was very formidable; it was only\r\n400 yards broad and was composed of a very high curtain from which\r\nprojected one large bastion in the centre and two demi-bastions\r\noverhanging the water on each flank, that of San Juan, above the\r\nestuary of the Urumea, that of Santiago on the western side nearest\r\nthe harbour. In front of the bastions was a very broad hornwork,\r\nhaving outside it the usual counterscarp, covered-way, and glacis.\r\nSpecialists, wise after the event, criticized the whole land-front:\r\nthey found its trace defective, considered that the scarp of the\r\nhornwork ought to have been more than 23 feet high, and pointed out\r\nthat in the rear line the two demi-bastions did not well protect the\r\nflanks, since they were not themselves covered by the hornwork, and had\r\nno ditch or glacis, because the salt water came up to their foot at\r\nhigh tide[781].\r\n\r\nBut as the land-front was never attacked, these objections were of\r\ncomparatively little importance. The weak side of St. Sebastian was\r\nreally its eastern water-front. The western water-front on the open\r\nbay was inaccessible; but on the opposite side, where the town wall ran\r\nalong the estuary of the river Urumea, the conditions were peculiar.\r\nThe Urumea is a tidal river--at high water it washes right up to the\r\nfoot of the walls, but at low tide it recedes into a narrow channel and\r\nleaves exposed an expanse of rock and sand, ranging in breadth from\r\n50 to 150 yards, all along the water-wall for a length of some 400\r\nyards--half the east side of the town. The rampart here was a plain\r\ncurtain, not very high and only 8 feet thick: of course it could have\r\nno ditch or other outer fittings, since the salt water reached right up\r\nto it for half the day. Its only salients, from which flank fire could\r\nbe used, were one small bastion (St. Elmo) and two ancient round towers\r\ncalled Los Hornos and Amezqueta, which projected slightly from the\r\nstraight curtain.\r\n\r\nAt high tide this water-front was unapproachable--at low tide it was\r\nweak and accessible, for the Urumea was fordable in many places, and\r\nshrank into a channel only 50 yards broad, meandering through a waste\r\nof shingle, rocks, and mud. On its eastern bank were rolling sandhills\r\nof some height, which commanded the isthmus and the southern half of\r\nthe town, from a distance of no more than 700 or 800 yards. To the\r\nright of the sandhills, called Los Chofres, was a steep hill, the Monte\r\nOlia, facing the castle of St. Sebastian across the broader part of\r\nthe estuary, and by no means out of gunshot of it, since not more than\r\n1,000 or 1,100 yards of water lies between them.\r\n\r\nSince it had been rebuilt as a fortress of the Vauban-Cohorn style\r\nin the last years of the seventeenth century, St. Sebastian had only\r\nonce been besieged: for during the Revolutionary War of 1792-5 it\r\nsurrendered without any resistance to the Jacobin armies, while in 1808\r\nNapoleon had seized it by treachery and not by force. The one formal\r\nattack made on it was by the Duke of Berwick in 1719, when the armies\r\nof the Regent Orleans crossed the Bidassoa, in the short war provoked\r\nby the ambitions of Elizabeth Farnese and Cardinal Alberoni. Berwick\r\nhad established his siege-batteries not on the isthmus, to batter the\r\nland-front, but on the Chofres sandhills, from whence he pounded the\r\neastern sea-front to pieces. Several breaches having been made in it,\r\nand trenches on the isthmus having been pushed as far as the glacis\r\nof the hornwork, the governor very tamely surrendered, without waiting\r\nfor an assault[782]. Unwarned by this revelation of the weakness of\r\nthe defences along the Urumea, the engineers of Philip V made no\r\nimprovements in them when they were reconstructed after the war, and\r\nthe fortress was in 1813 little different from what it had been in 1719.\r\n\r\nThe easy success of Marshal Berwick turned out a very unhappy thing\r\nfor the British army; for the history of the last siege being well\r\nremembered, Major Charles Smith, the senior engineer with Graham’s\r\ncolumn, reported that Berwick’s plan was the right one[783], when the\r\nfirst survey of the place was made. And when the head-quarters staff\r\ncame up, his superior officer, Sir Richard Fletcher, agreed with him,\r\nas did Colonel Dickson commanding the artillery. They all forgot that\r\nto make a breach with ease is not necessarily the same thing as to\r\ncapture a fortress, and that the eighteenth-century slackness of the\r\ngovernor, who capitulated when his walls were once breached, gave no\r\nindication of what might be done by a very resourceful and resolute\r\nFrench officer, who had in his mind Napoleon’s edict of 1811 that\r\nevery commandant who hauled down his flag before standing at least one\r\nassault should be sent before a court martial. Nor is there any doubt\r\nthat Wellington himself must take his share of the responsibility,\r\nas he went round the place on July 12th and had a good look at it,\r\nin company with Charles Smith and Dickson, from Monte Olia and the\r\nChofres sandhills. Dickson summed up the results of their discussion as\r\nfollows:--‘The project is to effect a breach in the uncovered sea-wall\r\nforming an angle on the left of the land-front, between two towers [Los\r\nHornos and Amezqueta], being the same spot the Duke of Berwick breached\r\nin 1719, when he took St. Sebastian. The convent of San Bartolomé,\r\nwhich the French have fortified and occupied in force, is absolutely\r\nnecessary to take first, in order to be able to advance on the isthmus\r\nin support of our breaching operations from the Chofres. The plan of\r\nattack was the proposition of Major Smith[784].’\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was not the regular and orthodox way to attack such a\r\nfortress--as it involved the making of breaches only accessible at low\r\ntide, in a part of the wall to which no trenches could draw near, since\r\nits lower courses were six feet under water for half the hours of the\r\nday. There would have to be a long advance from the nearest dry ground\r\non which approaches could be dug, across the tidal waste, in order to\r\nreach the spot selected for breaching. And this would undoubtedly be a\r\nvery bloody business for the exposed storming troops. The advantages\r\nto be gained were rapid action and a quick end, without the necessity\r\nwhich an orthodox scheme would have involved of sapping up to the\r\nhornwork, storming it, and then tackling the lofty bastion behind it.\r\nThe British engineer who wrote the history of the siege considered that\r\n‘the operations against San Sebastian afford a most impressive lesson\r\non the advantage of due attention to science and rule in the attack\r\nof fortified places: the effort then made to overcome and trample on\r\nsuch restrictions caused an easy and certain operation of eighteen or\r\ntwenty days to extend over sixty days, and to cost the besiegers 3,500\r\nmen killed, wounded, or taken, bearing strong testimony to the truth of\r\nthe maxim laid down by Marshal Vauban, that hurry in sieges does not\r\nlead to an early success, often delays it, and always makes it very\r\nbloody[785].’\r\n\r\nSt. Sebastian had been abandoned to its own resources on June 28, when,\r\nafter the departure of Foy’s troops from Oyarzun, the Spaniards had\r\nclosed in on the place, and established a blockade. The force employed\r\nwas four battalions of Biscayan volunteers under Mendizabal, the\r\nremains of the bands which Foy had beaten in May, and which had taken\r\npart on June 26 along with the British 1st Division in the combat of\r\nTolosa[786]. They were very irregular troops, and their indiscipline\r\nand incompetence shocked General Graham when he came to visit their\r\nlines on July 6th[787]. They had no notion of guarding themselves, and\r\nhad suffered severely, first from an attempt to storm San Bartolomé\r\non June 28th, and later from a French sortie on July 3, when Rey\r\nsent out two columns of 700 men from the Convent, which surprised\r\ntheir camp, took many prisoners, and drove them back for nearly two\r\nmiles. Graham recommended that they should be replaced at once by\r\nsolid troops, and at Wellington’s suggestion told off the British 5th\r\nDivision and the unattached Portuguese brigade of Bradford for the\r\nsiege[788]. Mendizabal’s men were sent off to join in the blockade of\r\nSantoña[789]. On July 7th the siege-troops arrived; the independent\r\nbrigade established itself on the Chofres, the 5th Division--still\r\nunder Oswald as at Vittoria--took post on the heights of Ayete, facing\r\nthe hill and convent of San Bartolomé. From this moment the serious\r\noperations may be considered to have begun. A blockade of the seaside\r\nhad been established, in a rather intermittent fashion, four days\r\nearlier, when Sir George Collier appeared in the bay with a frigate,\r\nthe _Surveillante_, a corvette, and two brigs, all the force that he\r\ncould collect for the moment in response to Wellington’s appeals to the\r\nAdmiralty. The amount was wholly inadequate, even when supplemented\r\nby some local fishing craft and pinnaces, which were manned by the\r\nbattalion of marines from Giron’s Galician army. All through the siege\r\nFrench _trincadores_ and luggers from Bayonne and St. Jean de Luz ran\r\nthe blockade at night, bringing in food, munitions, and reinforcements.\r\nFor Rey having asked for more gunners, he was sent several detachments\r\nof them, who all arrived in safety, while he got rid of many of his\r\nwounded by the returning vessels. Wellington was full of justifiable\r\nwrath at the miserable help given him--his objurgations brought\r\nfrom Lord Melville an unsatisfactory reply, to the effect that the\r\noperations in the Baltic and the American War absorbed many of the\r\nBritish light craft which would have been available in earlier years,\r\nand that the Admiralty had not been warned in the spring that any\r\nlarge fighting force would be wanted on the Biscay coast in July.\r\n‘Neither from you, nor from any other person at your suggestion, did\r\nwe ever receive the slightest intimation that more was expected than\r\nthe protection of your convoys, till the actual arrival of Sir Thomas\r\nGraham on the coast after the battle of Vittoria.’ Melville then\r\nproceeded to write lengthy observations on the dangerous nature of the\r\ncoast of Northern Spain, ‘where ships cannot anchor without extreme\r\nrisk, and are exposed to almost certain destruction in a gale, when\r\nfrom its direction they can neither haul off shore nor run for shelter\r\ninto a port. If you will ensure the ships a continuance of east winds,\r\nthey could remain with you, but not otherwise. All the small craft in\r\nthe British navy could not prevent the occasional entry of small boats\r\nby night into San Sebastian’s, though it may be rendered more difficult\r\nand uncertain.’ Melville then proceeded to tax Wellington with grave\r\nprofessional irregularity, for having written to Sir George Collier,\r\nand other naval officers, letters taxing the Admiralty with neglect and\r\nincompetence. ‘Appeals to subordinate officers against their superiors\r\nare not customary in any branch of the service, and must be injurious\r\nto the public interest[790].’\r\n\r\nIt was not so much the arguments used by Melville as his offensive\r\ntone which Wellington resented. The victor of Salamanca was naturally\r\nirritated at finding himself treated _de haut en bas_ by a personage\r\nof such complete insignificance, who had not even the equivocal\r\nreputation of his father (the devisor of so many unlucky expeditions,\r\nthe impeached minister of 1806) to lend weight to his lectures. He\r\nreplied in a very short letter that he was not desirous of getting into\r\ndiscussions, that his demands for more naval assistance had begun in\r\nthe winter of 1812-13, and that after reading over again his letters\r\nto naval officers he could see nothing to find fault with--save that\r\nhe had once sent to Sir George Collier an extract of a dispatch to\r\nLord Bathurst, instead of a separate communication on the same topic\r\naddressed to Collier personally--a trifling subject on which to start\r\na controversy[791]. Meanwhile he considered, as a dozen letters show,\r\nthat he was being poorly served by the Admiralty, and ‘formed private\r\nopinions on the subject--which private opinions may not perhaps deserve\r\nmuch attention,’ as he sardonically observed.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, the Admiralty had contrived to carry out according\r\nto Wellington’s request--the stores and battering train, which he had\r\naccumulated at Corunna in the spring, had come round to the Biscay\r\ncoast as soon as could have been expected; they had been sent to\r\nSantander, as he directed, and arrived in that harbour on the very day\r\n(June 29) on which Major Frazer, sent off four days after Vittoria,\r\ncame from Head-Quarters to inquire for them[792]. The orders were to\r\nland them at Deba in Guipuzcoa, fifteen miles west of St. Sebastian;\r\nbut just as the disembarkation was commencing (July 3), a change of\r\ndestination was made--everything was to be put ashore at Passages, a\r\nmuch more convenient place, only a couple of miles from the blockaded\r\nfortress. This is a most astonishing little harbour, the safest port\r\non the coast, for it is absolutely land-locked; its entrance is so\r\nnarrow that the circular basin looks like a lake without an issue,\r\ntill the eye has with some difficulty discovered its exit. It pays for\r\nits security, however, by being hard to enter in time of storm, when\r\nvery careful navigation is required. But a besieging army has seldom\r\nbeen granted a base so near to its field of operations--it was only\r\ntwo and a half miles from the water’s edge at Passages to the Chofres\r\nsandhills, where the chief batteries were to be constructed, though\r\nfour miles to the head of the isthmus where the left attack was to\r\nbe made. And the fording of the Urumea, whose bridge the French had\r\nburned, was sometimes dangerous--more than one gun was lost in the\r\nquicksands[793].\r\n\r\nBy the time that Wellington had worked out the scheme of assault with\r\nCharles Smith, the guns were already arriving, not only the battering\r\ntrain from Corunna, which had begun to come ashore on July 7, but the\r\nheavy artillery reserve of the army, which had traversed all the weary\r\nmiles of road from Ciudad Rodrigo. The total of pieces available was\r\ntwenty-eight from the convoy, six from the heavy battery of the army\r\nreserve, and six lent by Sir George Collier from the main deck of his\r\nship, the _Surveillante_--or forty in all[794]--a very different train\r\nfrom the miserable four guns which had battered Burgos in the preceding\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nBefore any regular siege work could begin, it was obviously necessary\r\nto clear the French out of the monastery of San Bartolomé, on its\r\nhill at the neck of the isthmus: till this should be taken, it was\r\nimpossible to get forward on the shore from which the assault was to\r\nbe delivered. Under-estimating the strength of the post Graham and the\r\nengineers, contrary to the advice of Major Hartmann of the K.G.L.,\r\nthe senior artillery officer present before Dickson’s arrival[795],\r\nhad tried to reduce it on July 7th by the fire of a Portuguese field\r\nbattery belonging to the artillery reserve; but the walls proved too\r\nsolid for 8-pounders to damage, and some firing with red hot shot\r\nfailed to set fire to the roof. It was clear that it would be necessary\r\nto wait for the heavy guns to come up. Meanwhile the French continued\r\nto strengthen San Bartolomé, throwing up an earthwork in its cemetery\r\nand loopholing and barricading the ruined houses near it, as well as\r\nthose in the burnt-out suburb of San Martin, which lay at its foot.\r\nThey also commenced a redoubt on the isthmus, half-way between the\r\noutlying convent and the hornwork in front of the city wall.\r\n\r\nWhile the siege train was being got ashore, the engineers made\r\nready the emplacements for the guns--they started with throwing up\r\ntwo batteries on the Ayete heights to play on the convent of San\r\nBartolomé[796], three on the Chofres sandhills[797] to act against the\r\nsea-wall where the main breach was to be formed, and one on the lofty\r\nMonte Olia, for long-distance fire against all the fortifications,\r\nincluding those of the rock of Monte Urgull[798]. But on the 14th, when\r\nthe battering began, the only guns used were those on the left attack\r\nopposite the convent, as it was considered unwise to molest the city\r\nfortifications before there was any way of getting near them: approach\r\nwas impossible as long as the isthmus was all in the enemy’s hands.\r\n\r\nTwo days’ battering (July 14-15) brought down the roof and part of\r\nthe walls of San Bartolomé, and damaged the subsidiary works around\r\nit severely. But General Rey was determined to hold on to his outer\r\ndefences as long as possible: the best part of two battalions was told\r\noff to hold the ruins and the suburb of San Martin behind them. On the\r\nafternoon of the 15th General Oswald, judging from the dilapidation of\r\nthe buildings that they were untenable, sent in the 8th Caçadores from\r\nhis Portuguese brigade to storm them; but the French had dug themselves\r\nwell in, a furious fire broke out against the assailants, and the\r\nattack was turned back with the loss of 65 men[799]. It was obvious\r\nthat more battering was required to evict the gallant garrison, so the\r\nfire was resumed on the 16th, with the aid of a field battery playing\r\nacross the Urumea to enfilade the defences, and to pound the ruined\r\nhouses of San Martin, where the French reserves were sheltering.\r\n\r\nThe fire was very effective: the inner woodwork of the monastery\r\nblazed up, its porch was levelled to the ground, great gaps appeared\r\nin the walls, and the earthwork in the cemetery was much damaged. At\r\n10 a.m. on the 17th a second storm was tried, with forces much larger\r\nthan those used at the first--not one battalion, but the equivalent\r\nof three: Oswald drew upon Bradford’s independent brigade from across\r\nthe Urumea for 700 Portuguese volunteers. Two columns were launched\r\nagainst the French position, each consisting of a screen of Caçadores,\r\na support of Portuguese Line troops, and a reserve of British companies\r\nfrom the first brigade of the 5th Division[800]. The right column\r\naimed at the cemetery earthwork and the fortified houses--the left at\r\nthe main buildings of the convent, which were still smouldering from\r\nthe fire. Both achieved their purpose without any very serious loss,\r\nand the garrison was driven down hill into the suburb of San Martin,\r\npursued by the stormers. Here the French reserves intervened, and for\r\na moment the attack was turned back; but the companies of the 1/9th\r\nwhich formed the British supports re-established the fight, and the\r\nenemy retired in disorder towards the town. Unfortunately the victors\r\npursued recklessly, and came under the fire of the French guns in the\r\nhornwork and the bastion behind it, whence many unnecessary casualties.\r\nFor it had never been intended that the troops should advance on to the\r\nisthmus, where of course they could do nothing against an intact front\r\nof fortifications. The total losses of the assailants were 207 killed\r\nand wounded--the 1/9th which had headed the rush on to the bare ground\r\nsuffering most, with 70 casualties. The French had 40 killed and 200\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nIt was now possible to commence the subsidiary attack on the side\r\nof the isthmus, as the French held nothing outside the walls save\r\nthe recently constructed redoubt in front of the hornwork[801]. Two\r\nbatteries were thrown up on the San Bartolomé hill, and on the 18th\r\nthe guns with which the convent had been breached were moved down\r\ninto them[802]. The main object of these batteries was to enfilade\r\nthe stretch of sea-wall, on which the greater weight of metal on the\r\nChofres downs was to play from the front. Two additional batteries\r\nwere thrown up, more to the right, which, while aiding the enfilading\r\nfire, were also intended to shell the land-front, and keep down the\r\nfire from the bastion and hornwork[803]. Finally, the Chofres attack\r\nwas strengthened with two more batteries[804]. On the night of the\r\n19th sixteen guns in all were in place on the isthmus front, or left\r\nattack, twenty-three on the right attack to the east of the Urumea,\r\nincluding six on the summit of the lofty Monte Olia, on the extreme\r\nflank[805]. Meanwhile the approaches, by which the troops would have\r\nto move out to assault the breaches when made, were not nearly so far\r\nforward as could have been desired: little more had been done than to\r\npush a zig-zag down the slope of San Bartolomé into the ruins of San\r\nMartin--further advance was made difficult by the fact that the French\r\nwere still holding the forward position of the redoubt in the centre of\r\nthe isthmus. It was only on the night between the 19th and 20th that\r\nthey evacuated this post[806]. Moreover the fire of the defence was as\r\nyet intact, since the British heavy batteries had not begun their work:\r\nhence the sap-head was a decidedly unhealthy place.\r\n\r\nAt 8 a.m. on the morning of July 20 nine of the eleven siege batteries\r\nopened--all but the two new ones on San Bartolomé, where the work\r\nwas a little belated. The effect of the first day’s work was fairly\r\nsatisfactory--the parapet of the sea-wall began to crumble, the enemy’s\r\nguns _en barbette_ on the land-front were partly silenced, and the high\r\ntrajectory fire from the lofty Monte Olia battery searched the streets,\r\nthe back of the bastion, and the interior of the hornwork. The enemy\r\nconcentrated all his attention on the largest British battery upon the\r\nChofres dunes, the eleven guns which were farthest forward (No. 3)\r\nand were doing much damage to the sea-wall. The counter-fire here was\r\nsevere--one gun was split by a ball striking its muzzle, others had\r\nwheels broken, three had to stop firing because their embrasures, badly\r\nbuilt with sand, fell in and could not be kept clear[807]. By evening\r\nonly six of the eleven guns were still at work.\r\n\r\nAn afternoon of wind and showers, which had made accurate aim\r\ndifficult, was followed on the night of the 20th-21st by a torrential\r\nrain, which much impeded the special work which had been set aside for\r\nthe dark hours. Seven hundred men from Spry’s Portuguese brigades had\r\nbeen told off to open a parallel right across the isthmus, starting\r\nfrom the lodgment already established in the ruined houses of San\r\nMartin. ‘In the perfect deluge the working parties sneaked away by\r\ndegrees into houses and holes and corners. After numerous difficulties\r\nand exertions only about 150 could be collected and set to work at 11\r\np.m. The party was not discovered, and the soil being light soon got\r\nunder cover.... But the parallel finished was for only about one-third\r\nof the extent required[808].’\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Sir Thomas Graham sent out a _parlementaire_ to\r\nsummon the governor to surrender--rather prematurely as it would seem,\r\nfor no real breach had yet been formed, nor had the fire of the defence\r\nbeen subdued. General Rey having made the answer that might be expected\r\nfrom a resolute officer[809], the battering recommenced, and was\r\ncontinued on the 21st-22nd-23rd-24th July. It was quite effective: on\r\nthe 23rd fifty yards of the curtain, between the towers of Los Hornos\r\nand Amezqueta, fell outward on to the strand that was exposed at low\r\nwater--appearing to present a practicable breach. But partly to make\r\nthings sure, and partly because the trenches on the isthmus were still\r\nremote from the point which it was intended to reach, the battering was\r\ncontinued for two days longer. Not only was more of the wall thrown\r\ndown near the tower of Los Hornos, but at Graham’s desire a second and\r\nminor breach was made, some distance farther north in the sea-wall than\r\nthe first[810]. The temptation to make it was that Spanish refugees\r\nbrought intelligence that the ramparts here were very thin--which\r\nproved to be the case, as one day’s battering brought down a broad\r\npatch of stones. On the other hand the specialists are said to have\r\nwarned Graham that the second breach would be rather useless, because\r\nthe space of shore below it exposed at low tide was very narrow--under\r\n50 feet wide--and could only be reached by skirting along for 300 yards\r\nbelow the walls and past the foot of the first breach. However, the\r\ncreation of a second point of attack would certainly distract part of\r\nthe attention of the garrison from the real place of danger, and if the\r\nsmall breach could be carried, the flank of the defenders of the great\r\nbreach would be effectually turned.\r\n\r\nIt was a thousand pities that the formation of the first breach on\r\nJuly 23rd was not followed by an immediate attempt to storm, as the\r\nenemy was given two whole days to perfect his inner defences. But an\r\nassault was impossible till the approaches should have got close to\r\nthe walls, and owing to the initial delays they were not ready till\r\ntwo days later. On the night of the 22nd-23rd the parallel reaching\r\nright across the isthmus was begun and half completed, with the French\r\n‘Cask Redoubt’ at its left extremity. Digging close to this spot, the\r\nworking parties found a large drain or channel 4 feet high and 3 feet\r\nwide, which belonged to the aqueduct which supplied the town with\r\nwater. It was empty, as the Spaniards had cut it off at its source\r\nwhen they first blockaded the town. Lieutenant Reid of the Engineers\r\nvolunteered to explore it, and crawling 230 yards forward, found that\r\nhe was under the west corner of the counterscarp of the hornwork, where\r\nthe French had cut off the channel and blocked it with a door. This\r\ndiscovery suggested to the engineers that the channel might be used as\r\na mine; if its farther end were filled with powder, and then built up\r\nwith sandbags, the explosion might bring down the counterscarp and fill\r\nthe ditch, so that the hornwork might be stormed across the débris.\r\nUnfortunately there was complete uncertainty as to whether the plan\r\nwould work: quite conceivably it might result in the door being blown\r\nopen, and the force of the powder might be spent in sending a local\r\nblast along the ditch, without much damaging the superincumbent earth.\r\nHowever, the experiment was tried; layers of sandbags were placed\r\nagainst the door, then thirty barrels of powder were inserted, standing\r\non end but not tamped in, for foul air greatly troubled the miners, so\r\nthat there was much empty space above and between the barrels. The near\r\nend was then built up with more sandbags and a train laid to the mouth\r\nof the channel in the trenches[811].\r\n\r\nDuring the day of the 23rd and the following night the parallel was\r\ncompleted, and good communications made from it to the base, the hill\r\nof San Bartolomé. The greater part of the enemy’s visible guns were\r\nsilenced, and the enfilading fire from the two last-erected batteries\r\non the isthmus set ablaze the quarter of the town immediately behind\r\nthe two breaches. This last achievement turned out to be anything but\r\nan advantage.\r\n\r\nFor arrangements for the assault having been made for daybreak on the\r\n24th, and the storming party and supports having been brought down to\r\nthe trenches after midnight, to wait till half low-tide, it was found\r\nthat the whole of the streets adjacent to the great breach were blazing\r\nso fiercely that it was thought that any entry into the town would be\r\nimpossible. Graham therefore countermanded the storm--this was probably\r\nnecessary; but Rey thereby gained another day for perfecting his\r\ninternal defences.\r\n\r\nThese were most elaborate and excellent, surpassing by far even\r\nthe very competent arrangements made by Philippon at Badajoz. The\r\npeculiar part of them was that Rey had to depend almost entirely on\r\nengineering work--his artillery having been completely crushed during\r\nthe preliminary battering. Such guns as he contrived to use on this day\r\nwere either very remote--on the rock and its slopes--or else pieces\r\nthat had been withdrawn and kept under cover till the critical moment\r\nshould arrive. The British artillery officers, whose telescopes were\r\nalways busy, discovered some of them, but informed Graham that they\r\nundertook to crush them when they should be brought out, provided that\r\nlight and atmospheric conditions were satisfactory[812].\r\n\r\nBut the main defence which Rey had prepared depended on fortification,\r\nnot on artillery fire. His chief advantage was that at both breaches\r\nthe stones had fallen outward, and the back of the ramparts was intact.\r\nAll along the sea-wall there was a drop of 15 to 20 feet from the\r\nrampart-walk into the street behind: this still existed, as the core\r\nof the wall was still standing, though the facing had given way. To\r\ndescend from the lip of the breach into the town, therefore, was\r\nmore than a feasible leap: it could not be done without ladders. Rey\r\nhad demolished some houses which had been built with their back to\r\nthe ramparts, and had cut away all stairs leading up to them. He had\r\nblocked with stone barricades all streets opening towards the breaches,\r\nand had loopholed all buildings commanding a view of them. When the\r\nfire in the quarter that had been ablaze on the 24th died down, he\r\nreoccupied the ruined houses, making shelters in the débris. He had\r\ncut off the rampart-walk on each side of the breaches by building a\r\nsuccession of stone traverses across it, so that troops who had mounted\r\nto the top could not push out sideways. As it was clear that the\r\nstorming columns would have to advance for 300 yards parallel with the\r\neastern _faussebraye_ of the hornwork, and close to it, because of the\r\nwater on their right, he told off a large number of picked marksmen to\r\nline this flank, and ranged live shells along it, which could be rolled\r\ndown on to the strand while the enemy were passing.\r\n\r\nThe preparation for a storm on the 24th, and its countermand because\r\nof the conflagration, had been noted by the governor, who understood\r\nthe cause of the delay. Obviously the attack would come on the\r\nfollowing morning, so the reserved guns were got into position after\r\nmidnight--two in the casemates of the high curtain, two others in\r\nthe ditch below it, one in the eastern face of the hornwork, two in\r\nthe south front of the bastion of St. Elmo: into the towers of Los\r\nHornos and Amezqueta, on each side of the main breach, three pieces\r\nwere hoisted not without difficulty, since the towers, though still\r\nstanding, were in bad order. Even in the distant and lofty Mirador\r\nbattery, on top of the rock, some guns were trained on the point of\r\ndanger[813]. Having made all possible preparations Rey waited for the\r\nassault, which came just as he had expected.\r\n\r\nThe exact share of responsibility for the details of the storm of July\r\n25th, which fell respectively on the engineers who had settled the\r\nscheme of attack, on Graham who designated the hour, on Oswald who\r\narranged the order of the troops, and on the artillery officers who had\r\nundertaken to keep down the enemy’s fire, is not easy to determine.\r\nAll apparently have to take their portion; but that of Charles Smith,\r\nwho devised, and Sir Richard Fletcher, who approved, the choice of the\r\nsea-wall for the breach-spot would seem to be the heaviest, and that of\r\nthe gunners the least.\r\n\r\nThe troops were to sally out from the eastern end of the long parallel\r\nacross the isthmus, when there should be a sufficient breadth of strand\r\nexposed for them to rush straight for the breaches, passing between the\r\nhornwork on their left and the receding tidal water on their right.\r\nUnfortunately the hour of low tide and the hour of daybreak were not\r\nconveniently correlated: the ideal combination would have been that\r\nthe four hours during which there was good access across the exposed\r\nflats should have been from 5.30 a.m. till 9.30 a.m.: daybreak falling\r\nat about 5.20 a.m. But as it chanced the extreme of low tide that day\r\nwas at 6 a.m., and the practicable hours were from 4 a.m. onward. In\r\norder to lose none of the limited time available, Graham determined\r\nthat the rush should be made at 5 o’clock sharp, before it was full\r\ndaylight; and this choice had one unlucky effect. The engineers settled\r\nthat the signal for assault should be the blowing up of the mine in\r\nthe aqueduct[814]; but they had so little confidence in its effect,\r\nthat the only arrangements made to utilize it were that supposing it\r\nshould do much damage and blow down scarp and counterscarp (which was\r\nhardly expected), the Portuguese companies which held the extreme left\r\nof the parallel should make a rush at the west flank of the hornwork,\r\nand enter over the débris. This was a very half-hearted scheme. For\r\nthe real assault General Oswald seems to have made a very faulty\r\ndisposition of his troops. The opening made in the parallel was so\r\nnarrow that not more than two or three men could issue abreast. The\r\ntroops, therefore, had to start in a sort of narrow file or procession,\r\nand took an unconscionable time in trickling out from the trench.\r\nThe head of the column was composed of the right wing of the 3/1st\r\n(Royal Scots); then came a ladder party from all three regiments of\r\nHay’s brigade; then the left wing of the Royal Scots: all these were\r\nto strike for the main breach. Next were the 1/38th, who were directed\r\nto pass between the leading troops and the water’s edge, and to make\r\nfor the lesser breach, along the ever-narrowing strip of exposed beach.\r\nLast came the 1/9th, the third battalion of the brigade, with orders to\r\nsupport wherever it could make itself most useful. Some picked shots\r\nfrom the 8th Caçadores of Spry’s brigade were placed along the front of\r\nthe parallel, and in a ditch which had been scraped during the night a\r\nfew yards in advance of it, with orders to try to keep down the enemy’s\r\nmusketry from the eastern flank of the hornwork.\r\n\r\nAt 5 o’clock, or perhaps a little earlier[815], the mine was fired, and\r\ndid much more damage than was expected, blowing down the counterscarp\r\nof the western flank of the hornwork, injuring the scarp, and filling\r\nthe ditch with earth. The Portuguese troops in the opposite trench\r\nmade an assault, according to their orders, swept over the covered\r\nway and into the ditch, and tried to enter the work. They failed\r\nwith loss, because no proper preparations had been made to utilize\r\nthe opportunity[816], which indeed had hardly been taken into\r\nconsideration. They might have got in, for the French garrison flinched\r\nat first, terrified by the explosion.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the main attack the Royal Scots led out of the parallel\r\nimmediately that the explosion was heard, and pushed forward in almost\r\ncomplete darkness on to the strand. It was found to consist in many\r\nplaces of hard rock overgrown with slippery seaweed, and interspersed\r\nwith deep pools. The men stumbled over, and into, many traps which\r\nmight have been avoided by daylight, and all order was lost. But for\r\nthe first few minutes there was little fire bearing on them, and\r\nthe platoons at the head of the column reached the main breach.\r\nThe conducting engineer, Lieutenant Harry Jones, and Major Fraser,\r\ncommanding the wing of the Royal Scots, had actually got to the lip\r\nof the breach, with the leading men of the storming party, before\r\nthe enemy really opened. That the crowning of the breach was not\r\nfollowed by a rush into the town was due to Rey’s precautions--there\r\nwas a sudden drop of twenty feet between the top of the wall and the\r\nstreet below, and no means to descend, as all stairs and ramps had\r\nbeen cut away. There were some ladders with the column, but not at its\r\nhead--they were being carried in the rear of the right wing of the\r\nRoyal Scots. As the leading company came to a halt the French began\r\nto shoot hard from behind traverses on the rampart-walk, barricades,\r\nand loopholed houses, and the guns in the two flanking towers played\r\non the breach with grape. The head of the column began to wither away;\r\nFraser and Jones were both wounded--the former mortally--and so was\r\nevery man who had reached the summit. The survivors on the breach\r\nthrew themselves down among the stones and began to return the enemy’s\r\nfire--the first impetus being lost, and any chance of success with it.\r\n\r\nBut it was only about the equivalent of a company which had advanced so\r\nfar; the rear of the right wing of the Royal Scots were still passing\r\nalong the flank of the hornwork, in a straggling file, when the enemy’s\r\nfire began to be serious. It came most fiercely from an entrenchment\r\nwhich Rey had thrown up across the main ditch between the hornwork\r\nand the high front of the demi-bastion behind it. It seems, from the\r\nnarrative of an officer who took a prominent part in the storm--Colin\r\nCampbell of the 1/9th, who was with the ladder party--that many of the\r\nRoyal Scots, arriving in the darkness at this opening into the main\r\nditch, mistook it for a passage by which they might force their way\r\ninto the place, or even for the great breach itself. At any rate they\r\nturned in toward it, and on meeting with strenuous resistance began\r\nto fire upon the enemy. The men following gathered in upon the first\r\ncomers, and a crowd accumulated at this point, which checked the ladder\r\nparty and the left wing of the Royal Scots as they came up. Hardly\r\nany one pressed on to join the head of the column on the slope of the\r\nbreach. Meanwhile the tail of the column was blocked, as it tried to\r\npress on past the hornwork. The French, standing above, rolled down the\r\nshells which had been laid ready upon the British below, and kept up a\r\nvigorous discharge of musketry. With great exertions individual company\r\nofficers succeeded in collecting parties of their own men, and leading\r\nthem out of the crowd, so as to pass on to the great breach. But the\r\nattack there had already come to nothing: the stones all up the slope\r\nwere strewn with dead and wounded--a few survivors were keeping up an\r\nineffectual return fire upon the well-concealed enemy. Three or perhaps\r\nfour attempts to mount again were made by small parties of the rear\r\ncompanies of the Royal Scots, but there were never more than 80 or 90\r\nmen acting together, and the officers and leading men were always shot\r\ndown on the crest. At last the senior captain surviving, seeing the\r\nimpossibility of getting forward, ordered the stormers to retire, which\r\nthey did--only half an hour or less after the assault commenced--though\r\nthe time had seemed much longer, as was natural, to those involved\r\nin the bloody business. The larger body of men engaged farther back,\r\nopposite the main ditch and under the demi-bastion of St. Juan, gave\r\nway also when the head of the column fell back among them: they had\r\nthemselves suffered heavily, and of course had made no progress. Just\r\nas the whole body rolled back along the beach they came into collision\r\nwith the front of the 1/38th, who had only just finished filing out\r\nof the parallel, so slow was the process of emerging from its narrow\r\nexit. Their commanding officer, Colonel Greville, had halted them for\r\na short time to let their rear close up, and to prevent them from\r\ndribbling forward in a thin string of small parties, as the Royal Scots\r\nhad done. Just as they came parallel with the north end of the hornwork\r\nthe broken mass of men from the front ran in upon them; all order was\r\nlost at once, and after some vain attempts to get forward the 38th fell\r\nback along with the rest over the slippery shore[817]. The disordered\r\ncrowd suffered heavily from the French grape and musketry--they were a\r\nmark impossible to miss, and strewed the rocks and pools with dead. The\r\n1/9th, who were just beginning to file out of the parallel, were of\r\ncourse ordered back at once--‘but had lost almost as many heads as they\r\nshowed[818].’\r\n\r\nSo quickly was the whole affair over that the artillerymen, standing\r\nby their guns on the opposite side of the Urumea, ready to co-operate\r\nas soon as dawn should come, believed at first that there had been a\r\nfeint or a false attack. It was only when the growing light showed them\r\nthe breach strewn from lip to foot with red coats, and the strand below\r\nthickly dotted with them also, that they realized that the assault had\r\nbeen made and had failed[819], without their being given the chance to\r\nintervene as they had promised.\r\n\r\nThe loss had, of course, been very heavy--out of 571 casualties of all\r\nranks[820] more than 330 belonged to the unfortunate Royal Scots, whose\r\nright wing companies were almost exterminated. Six officers and 118\r\nmen, almost all wounded, fell into the hands of the enemy. It should\r\nbe remembered to the credit of the garrison that, the moment that the\r\nstorm was over, they collected from the foot of the breach and the\r\nneighbouring strand many officers and men who would otherwise have been\r\ndrowned by the returning tide[821]. When it was seen that this was the\r\ntask of the French who were seen busy on the beach, a flag of truce\r\nwas hoisted, and all firing ceased for an hour. The prisoners, one of\r\nwhom, the engineer Harry Jones, has left an interesting account of his\r\nexperiences during the next six weeks[822], were very well treated.\r\nThe extremely moderate loss of the garrison was 18 killed and 49\r\nwounded--all by musketry fire, since by the abominable misarrangement\r\nof the assault the British artillery had no chance of acting.\r\n\r\nTwo comments by eye-witnesses on this woeful business are worth giving.\r\nColin Campbell wrote:\r\n\r\n‘One main cause of failure was the narrow front and consequent length\r\nand thinness of the column in which we advanced. This necessarily\r\nbecame more loosened and disjointed by the difficult nature of the\r\nground it had to pass over in the dark. It reached the breach in\r\ndriblets and never in such body or number as to give the mind of the\r\nsoldier anything like confidence in success. If some means had been\r\ndevised of starting the Royals in one big honest lump, which might have\r\nbeen contrived without much difficulty or danger, so that they could\r\nhave started in some dense form, with the 38th well packed up in a\r\nfront of fours in readiness to start immediately behind after them, the\r\nstoppage at the demi-bastion would never have occurred, and some 200\r\nmen at least of the Royals would have reached the breach in a compact\r\nbody. Such a number would have forced bodily through all opposition.\r\nEven under all the disadvantages of bad arrangements, I firmly believe\r\nthat if we had moved forward by daylight, when an officer could have\r\nseen, and been seen by, his men, when the example of the former would\r\nhave animated the exertions of the latter, the Royals would have gone\r\nover the breach on July 25th[823].’\r\n\r\nCampbell’s blame, therefore, would fall mainly on Oswald, who, though\r\nhe had protested against the points chosen for attack, had actually\r\narranged the troops, and failed to remember that men should go ‘over\r\nthe top’ on a broad front, and on Graham, who fixed the ‘Zero’ point\r\nhalf an hour before dawn. Gomm, of the 1/9th, also a most distinguished\r\nand capable officer, goes for other game--the officers of the\r\nscientific services:\r\n\r\n‘I am afraid our success at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, owing to the\r\nalmost miraculous efforts of the troops, has stopped the progress\r\nof science among our engineers, and perhaps done more; for it seems\r\nto have inspired them with a contempt for so much of it as they had\r\nattained before. Our soldiers have on all occasions stood fire so well\r\nthat our artillery have become as summary in their processes as our\r\nengineers. Provided that they have made a hole in the wall, by which\r\nwe can claw up, they care not about destroying defences. In fact, we\r\nhave been called upon hitherto to ensure the success of our sieges\r\nby the sacrifice of lives. Our Chief Engineers and Commandants of\r\nArtillery remind me of Burke’s “Revolutionary Philosophers” and their\r\n“dispositions which make them indifferent to the cause of humanity;\r\nthey think no more of men than of mice in an air pump”. We came before\r\nthe place well equipped with all the means necessary for attacking\r\nit _en règle_, and I saw no reason for attacking it otherwise. I may\r\ndwell longer than I ought to do on this subject. But it is, at least,\r\npardonable in us, who are most nearly concerned, to become tedious\r\nin passing our censure upon the methods of those whom we cannot but\r\nconsider as the authors of our calamity; which, as it was foreseen by\r\nothers, and _might_ have been by them, could have been avoided.’\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the assault seems to show that both Campbell and\r\nGomm had reason for their complaints, though they chose different\r\npoints to criticize. But of the various errors made, undoubtedly the\r\nmost fatal of all was attempting to storm breaches that could only be\r\napproached by a long defile along the flank of the hornwork, which\r\nwas intact and well garrisoned. And for this the engineers have to\r\ntake the responsibility. Camp rumour very cruelly put the blame on the\r\ntroops[824], alleging that there had been a panic: this was a monstrous\r\ninjustice. Everything that mismanagement could accomplish had been done\r\nto discourage them; but it was not poor spirit, but physical incapacity\r\nto finish a task impossible under the conditions set, that caused them\r\nto retire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Attack of ST SEBASTIAN between 11th July & 9th Sept 1813]\r\n\r\nWellington had, on the 24th, received disquieting news about movements\r\non the French front, and was very anxious to hear of the fall of St.\r\nSebastian before he might be committed to another campaign in the\r\nfield. He stopped at his head-quarters at Lesaca on the morning of\r\nthe 25th, lest more definite and threatening information might come\r\nto hand. During the hours of dawn he was standing about in Lesaca\r\nchurchyard listening to the guns, and speculating on the cause of their\r\ncessation at 6 o’clock, when the armistice to recover the wounded was\r\nmade. At 11 came a messenger, Colonel de Burgh, to say that the assault\r\nhad failed with loss. This was a severe and rather unexpected blow;\r\nWellington had counted on success as probable[825]. Taking the\r\nchance of more news coming in from the Pyrenees during his absence,\r\nhe rode over in haste to St. Sebastian and inspected the scene of the\r\ndisaster. He declared that the siege must continue, that the Hornwork\r\nand the demi-bastion of San Juan must be battered to pieces, and that\r\nthe engineers had better draw up an alternative scheme for an attack\r\n_en règle_ on the land front. More guns and ammunition were expected\r\nfrom England; the latter was much needed, for the reserve was low after\r\nthe rapid firing on the 22nd-24th. There would probably be some delay\r\nbefore a second storm could be tried[826].\r\n\r\nWhile riding back to Lesaca after his flying visit to the trenches,\r\nWellington was met on the road by messengers of evil. The threats of\r\nthe preceding day had turned into imminent dangers. Heavy firing had\r\nbeen heard since noon from the side of the Bastan, seeming to show that\r\nHill’s divisions at the Pass of Maya were being attacked. And just as\r\nhe reached his head-quarters a messenger came up from Cole, at the\r\nextreme southern end of the line, to say that he had been assailed in\r\nthe Pass of Roncesvalles by the enemy in overwhelming strength, and had\r\nbeen fighting hard since dawn--results were still uncertain[827].\r\n\r\nWithout further information it was, of course, impossible to take more\r\nthan preliminary measures for parrying the French thrust. Wellington\r\nspeculated on the situation: one of its meanings might be that the\r\nenemy was demonstrating at Roncesvalles and Maya, in order to cover\r\na thrust on the side of the Bidassoa, with the object of raising\r\nthe siege of St. Sebastian. He wrote at once to Graham that he must\r\nexpect to be attacked in force, telling him to ship his siege-guns at\r\nPassages[828], to leave a minimum of troops to continue the blockade,\r\nand to concentrate for the defence of the line of the Bidassoa. It is\r\nclear that Wellington was thinking of the scandal caused by the loss\r\nof Murray’s guns at Tarragona, and was determined that his own siege\r\ntrain should be afloat betimes. After the guns were safe other stores\r\nwere put on shipboard.\r\n\r\nSo ended the first siege of St. Sebastian--a depressing failure not\r\ncreditable to any one engaged in it. As if the tale of disaster was\r\nnot complete, a disgraceful incident happened on the night of the\r\n26th-27th. Rey had noted the disarmament of the batteries proceeding\r\nall day, and the departure of troops; he resolved to try a sortie at\r\nnight, to see if the besiegers were all absconding. Before dawn five\r\ncompanies emerging from the Hornwork swept along the parallel, guarded\r\nat the moment by detachments of Spry’s Portuguese brigade. Such a bad\r\nwatch was kept that they were completely surprised, three officers\r\nand 198 men were captured: the remainder of the trench-guard fled\r\nback to the suburb of San Martin. When the reserves came up and made\r\nfor the parallel, it was found that the French had retired with their\r\nprisoners, after doing some inconsiderable damage to the works[829].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII: CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOULT TAKES THE OFFENSIVE IN NAVARRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Dalmatia had arrived at Bayonne on the afternoon of July\r\n11th: on the morning of the following day he had taken over from the\r\nhands of King Joseph the command of the armies of Spain, after a short\r\nand formal interview, at which each said little and thought much. When\r\nthe King had departed to his enforced retirement, the Marshal called\r\ntogether the senior officers of all the four armies, and informed\r\nthem that by the Emperor’s orders he had to carry out a general\r\nreorganization, which would affect the positions of many of them. There\r\nwould for the future be one Army of Spain--the separate staffs would\r\ndisappear: so would many divisional commands, administrative offices,\r\nand departmental posts. He had been entrusted by the Emperor with full\r\nauthority to carry out the changes on his own responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis was a great moment for Soult: he had at last achieved his\r\nambition, and received that full power over all the armies of Spain\r\nwhich he had coveted since 1808, and had never attained, either while\r\nthe Emperor pretended to direct in person the war in the Peninsula,\r\nor while King Joseph held the nominal post of commander-in-chief. It\r\nis true that the long-desired position came to him in consequence of\r\na terrible disaster to the imperial arms, but there were compensating\r\nadvantages even in this: the disaster, as he conceived, had been due\r\nto his old enemies--at any rate it could be ascribed to them with all\r\nplausibility. And he was thus provided with an admirable opportunity\r\nto repay old grudges, of which he took full advantage in the famous\r\nproclamation issued to the army before the commencement of his new\r\ncampaign: it is a series of elaborate insults to his predecessors, as a\r\nshort quotation may show.\r\n\r\n‘Soldiers! with well-equipped fortresses in front and in rear, a\r\ncapable general possessing the confidence of his troops could by the\r\nchoice of good positions have faced and defeated the motley levies\r\nopposed to you. Unhappily at the critical moment timid and downhearted\r\ncounsels prevailed. The fortresses were abandoned or blown up: a hasty\r\nand disorderly retreat gave confidence to the enemy; and a veteran\r\narmy, weak in numbers (it is true) but great in everything that\r\nconstitutes military character, that army which had fought, bled, and\r\nconquered in every province of Spain, saw with indignation its laurels\r\nblighted, and was forced to abandon its conquests, the trophies of\r\nmany sanguinary days of battle. When at last the cries of an indignant\r\narmy stopped the dishonourable flight, and its chief, touched by a\r\nfeeling of shame, and yielding to the general desire, gave battle in\r\nfront of Vittoria, who can doubt that a general worthy of his troops\r\ncould have won the success merited by their generous enthusiasm, and\r\ntheir splendid sense of honour? Did he make the arrangements and direct\r\nthe movements which should have assured to one part of his army the\r\nhelp and support of the rest?... Soldiers! I sympathize with your\r\ndisappointment, your grievances, your indignation. I know that the\r\nblame for the present situation must be imputed to others. It is your\r\ntask to repair the disaster[830].’\r\n\r\nThis may have been good ‘propaganda’ for the army--it served to soothe\r\ntheir wounded pride by throwing all blame on their late commanders. But\r\nthere can be no doubt that it was inspired not so much by this very\r\ncomprehensible motive as by long-cherished malice and hatred for the\r\nunfortunate Joseph and Jourdan. This was quite in keeping with Soult’s\r\ncharacter. He was a most distinguished soldier, but a most unamiable\r\nman; and his memory was as long as his spite was strong.\r\n\r\nWe have already had much to write on this cold calculating son of a\r\nprovincial lawyer--one of the few ‘best military brains,’ as his master\r\ncalled him, but also, as King Joseph truly observed, ‘untrustworthy,\r\nperverse, dangerous[831].’ He served the Emperor well as long as their\r\ninterests coincided, but he was quite ready for any other profitable\r\nservice. Some thirteen months later, as the war minister of Louis\r\nXVIII, he showed himself a zealous persecutor of Bonapartists[832].\r\nSoult was the most monstrous of egotists; at this moment his ambition\r\nserved his master well: no general save William III ever won so much\r\ncredit from a series of defeats as did Soult in 1813-14 from the\r\noperations that began with the disaster of Sorauren and ended with the\r\nloss of Toulouse. But on the receipt of the news of the abdication at\r\nFontainebleau he became a zealous Royalist: eighteen months later he\r\nwas, as the minister of the Bourbons, issuing flamboyant proclamations\r\nagainst ‘the usurper and adventurer, Napoleon Bonaparte[833].’ Yet in\r\nthe Hundred Days he was to be found as the ‘usurper’s’ Chief of the\r\nStaff on the field of Waterloo! Proscribed for a short time on account\r\nof this unhappy error in calculation, he was so far back in favour with\r\nthe ‘powers that were’ as to receive a gift of 200,000 francs from\r\nLouis XVIII in 1820, and the grand cordon of St. Louis from Charles X\r\nin 1825, on the occasion of his coronation at Reims.\r\n\r\nBut as long as Napoleon I was emperor, Nicholas Soult was his most\r\nvaluable lieutenant: their interests coincided, and it is certain that\r\nnone of the other marshals would have played such a creditable losing\r\ngame on the Pyrenees and the plains of Southern France against such an\r\nadversary as Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe Army of Spain received the news of his advent with mixed feelings.\r\nThere was a considerable faction among his own old generals of\r\nAndalusia, who welcomed back one who had been an indulgent spectator of\r\ntheir peculations--of which he himself had set the example. For Soult’s\r\nacquisitiveness was portentous--he was ready to snatch at everything\r\nfrom a shadowy Portuguese crown in Oporto to inferior Murillos in the\r\nconvents of Seville. The train of his personal plunder had excited\r\nanger, envy, or derision, according to the temper of the observer, as\r\nit defiled through Madrid, when he quitted Spain five months back. He\r\nhad left behind him many adherents, who followed him for the same\r\nmotive for which he himself followed Napoleon. They rejoiced at his\r\nreturn, believing, not in error, that his patronage would be exercised\r\nin favour of old comrades of the Army of the South, rather than for the\r\nbenefit of strangers. Others held that he was to be welcomed because\r\nany leadership would be better than that of King Joseph, and because\r\nhis undoubted military talents would be exercised in the best style\r\nwhen he was working for his own credit, and not for that of any one\r\nelse. Like the Emperor, they had a great belief in his brains. It was\r\ndifficult to feel much personal enthusiasm for a chief so self-centred,\r\nso cold and hard in his dealings with subordinates, so ready to shift\r\nblame on to other men’s shoulders, so greedy in getting and so mean\r\nin spending. But at any rate he would not be weak like Jourdan, or\r\nrash like Marmont, or simply incapable like Dorsenne or Caffarelli. A\r\ngeneral who served as his senior aide-de-camp for eight uncomfortable\r\nyears, and left his staff with glee, sums him up in the following cruel\r\nphrases:\r\n\r\n‘In war he loved vigorous enterprises, and when once committed to a\r\nscheme stuck to it with obstinacy and force. If I say that he loved\r\nvigorous enterprises I must add that he loved them provided that\r\nthey did not involve too much personal danger, for he was far from\r\npossessing the brilliant courage of Ney or Lannes. It might even be\r\nsaid that he was the very reverse of rash--that he was a little too\r\ncareful of himself. This failing grew upon him after his great fortune\r\nhad come to him--and indeed it was not uncommon to meet officers\r\nwho showed no care of their lives when they were mere colonels or\r\nbrigadiers, but who in later years took cover behind their marshal’s\r\nbâton. But this caution visible on the battlefield did not follow him\r\nto the tent, under whose roof he conceived and ordered, often in the\r\npresence of the enemy, movements of great audacity--whose execution\r\nhe handed over to officers of known courage and resolution[834].’\r\nAnother contemporary makes remarks to much the same effect, ‘Proud of\r\nthe reputation which he had usurped, he was full of assurance on the\r\nday before a battle: he recovered that same assurance the day after a\r\ndefeat. But in action he seemed unable to issue good orders, to choose\r\ngood positions, or to move his troops freely. It seemed as if any\r\nscheme which he had once conceived and written down at his desk was an\r\nimmutable decree from heaven, which he had not the power to vary by\r\nsubsequent changes[835].’\r\n\r\nThis is much what Wellington meant when he observed in familiar\r\nconversation that Soult was not equal to Masséna. ‘He did not quite\r\nunderstand a field of battle: he knew very well how to bring his troops\r\non to the field, but not so well how to use them when he had brought\r\nthem up[836].’\r\n\r\nBut on July 12th Soult, with his great opportunity before him, was in\r\nhis audacious mood, and it was in all sincerity that he had written to\r\nthe Emperor before he assumed his command, that he would concentrate\r\nthe army, and retake the offensive within a very few days, and that\r\nhe trusted to be able to stop the movements of Wellington. This was\r\nno small promise considering the state in which the army was handed\r\nover to him, and it is a marvellous proof of his driving power that he\r\nactually succeeded in launching a most dangerous attack on Wellington’s\r\nline by the thirteenth day after his arrival at Bayonne.\r\n\r\nThe detailed orders for the reorganization of the army were published\r\non July 15th. Soult had started with a general idea of the lines\r\non which they were to be carried out, and had just received a more\r\ndefinite scheme from the Emperor, sent off from Dresden on July 5th\r\nin pursuit of him. Napoleon ordered that not only were the armies of\r\nthe North, South, Centre, and Portugal to be abolished--their names\r\nwere now absurd anachronisms--but, despite of the great number of\r\ntroops available, no army corps were to be created. Evidently he\r\nhad come to the conclusion that not only army-commanders, but even\r\narmy-corps-commanders might be strong enough to impair the complete\r\ncontrol which he wished to give over to Soult. He directed that the\r\ninfantry should be divided into as many divisions of two brigades and\r\n6,000 men each as the available total of bayonets could complete. The\r\nMarshal was authorized to work them as he pleased, in groups of two,\r\nthree, or four divisions. To command these groups (which were really\r\narmy-corps in all but name) he might appoint three officers with the\r\ntitle of lieutenant-general, who would have the divisional generals\r\nunder their orders. There were to be no special staffs for the groups,\r\nwhose composition the Marshal might alter from time to time: the\r\nlieutenant-generals were only to be allowed a chief staff-officer and\r\ntheir own personal aides-de-camp, and their pay was to be no more than\r\n40,000 francs per annum. Clearly there was to be no recrudescence of\r\nthe enormous staffs and liberal perquisites and allowances of the old\r\ncorps-commanders.\r\n\r\nArtillery might still be short, despite of the large number of guns\r\nsent up to the front from Toulouse and Bordeaux. But the Emperor\r\ndirected that each infantry division ought to have two field batteries,\r\neach cavalry division one horse artillery battery, and that Soult\r\nought to create an army-reserve of two horse artillery batteries and\r\nseveral batteries of guns of position. There was to be one general\r\ncommanding artillery and one general commanding engineers for the whole\r\narmy, and (what was quite as important) one commissary general only,\r\nin whose hands all responsibilities for food and transport were to be\r\ncentralized.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, but not in all details, Soult carried out these\r\norders. The gross total of the troops under his command would appear\r\nto have been 117,789 of all ranks. But this included the garrisons\r\nof St. Sebastian, Pampeluna, and Santoña, 8,200 men in all: also\r\n5,595 half-trained conscripts of the Bayonne Reserve, 16,184 sick and\r\ndetached, and over 4,500 men of the non-combatant services--_ouvriers\r\nmilitaires_, transport train, ambulance train, &c. Deducting these,\r\nhe had available 84,311 fighting men, of whom 72,664 were infantry,\r\n7,147 cavalry, and about 4,000 artillery, sappers and miners,\r\ngendarmerie[837], &c. This total does not include Paris’ troops from\r\nSaragossa, who were lying at Jaca, and had not yet joined the Army of\r\nSpain, being still credited to Suchet’s Army of Aragon and Valencia.\r\n\r\nSoult created out of these elements nine fighting divisions of\r\ninfantry, two of cavalry, and a strong but miscellaneous Reserve\r\nCorps, which had the equivalent of five brigades. The plan which he\r\nadopted for the reorganization was to select nine of the old infantry\r\ndivisions (of which there had been 14-1/2) and to keep them as the\r\nbases of the new units, drafting into them the battalions of the\r\nother five[838]. Those abolished were the two divisions (Abbé’s and\r\nVandermaesen’s) of the Army of the North, Sarrut’s division of the\r\nArmy of Portugal, Leval’s of the Army of the South, and Darmagnac’s of\r\nthe Army of the Centre. Sarrut had been killed at Vittoria, Leval had\r\ngone to Germany; but provision was made for the other three generals\r\nwhose divisions were ‘scrapped’: Abbé took over Villatte’s old division\r\nof the Army of the South, while Villatte went to command the general\r\nreserve. Vandermaesen was given the division of the Army of Portugal\r\nlately under Barbot, who relapsed into the status of a brigadier.\r\nDarmagnac went with the two French regiments of his old division to\r\njoin the surviving unit of the Army of the Centre, Cassagne’s division,\r\nand took command of it--Cassagne, its former chief, disappearing.\r\nLastly, Daricau having been severely wounded at Vittoria, his division\r\nwas given to Maransin, whose independent brigade was absorbed. Thus,\r\nof the old divisions, only those of Foy, Conroux, Maucune, Taupin,\r\nLamartinière, remained under their original leaders: the other four\r\nsurviving divisions got new chiefs, whose names are familiar to us, but\r\nwho had hitherto been connected with quite different troops.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s ideal of the ‘standard’ division of 6,000 men was not\r\naccurately realized, owing to the fact that some corps had suffered\r\nheavily and others hardly at all during the recent campaign. Putting\r\nsix regiments into each division, Soult found that he had created units\r\nvarying in size from Abbé’s with 8,030 men to Vandermaesen’s, with only\r\n4,181. For there was no uniformity of size among the regiments, which\r\nvaried from 1,900 bayonets in three battalions[839] down to 430 in\r\none[840]. Abbé’s, Lamartinière’s, Conroux’s, and Darmagnac’s divisions\r\nhad 7,000 men each, or more; Foy’s, Taupin’s, and Maransin’s just\r\nabout 6,000; Vandermaesen’s and Maucune’s not much over 4,000 each.\r\nIt was still impossible to carry out Napoleon’s orders to give each\r\ndivision two batteries of field artillery, only one apiece could be\r\nprovided; but, this moderate provision having been made, there remained\r\nover for the general artillery reserve two batteries of horse and two\r\nof field artillery. The army had in all 140 guns horsed--72 with the\r\ninfantry divisions, 32 with Villatte’s reserve, 12 with the cavalry\r\ndivisions, 24 as general army reserve. There were also three mountain\r\nbatteries--two- or three-pounders carried on muleback.\r\n\r\nFor his chief of the staff Soult chose Gazan, who had long served with\r\nhim in the same capacity in Andalusia. The late generals-in-chief of\r\nthe Armies of Portugal, the North and the Centre--Reille, Clausel, and\r\nDrouet D’Erlon, naturally took the three lieutenant-generalcies: Soult\r\ngave each of them three divisions in charge, but being prohibited from\r\ncalling these groups ‘army corps’, he styled them the ‘lieutenancies’\r\nof the Right, Left, and Centre. These terms soon became anomalous--for\r\nby the chances of manœuvre the ‘Centre’--D’Erlon’s group--during the\r\ncampaign of the Pyrenees fought on the right, the ‘left’ (Clausel)\r\nin the Centre, and the ‘right’ (Reille) on the left wing. The absurd\r\nnomenclature of the groups sometimes makes a French dispatch hard to\r\nunderstand: it would have been much simpler to call the three groups\r\narmy-corps, but this designation was under taboo by the Emperor’s\r\nspecial command.\r\n\r\nClausel took the left lieutenancy, because he and his troops, which\r\nhe had brought back from his long march in Aragon, were actually on\r\nthe left on June 15th: he had under him the two divisions, those of\r\nVandermaesen and Taupin, which practically represented the bulk of\r\nhis former column, with Conroux’s division which had remained at St.\r\nJean-Pied-du-Port when the rest of the Army of the South went to the\r\nBidassoa. The total of bayonets was 17,218--this was the weakest of the\r\n‘lieutenancies’ because the individual regiments recently returned\r\nfrom Aragon were low in numbers from three months of mountain warfare\r\nagainst Mina.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon had the Centre, with the divisions of Abbé and Maransin,\r\nboth consisting of old Andalusian regiments, and of Darmagnac, who\r\nrepresented the French part of the Army of the Centre. His corps were\r\nstrong--just under 21,000 bayonets[841].\r\n\r\nReille, late chief of the Army of Portugal, had the remaining three\r\ndivisions, Foy, Maucune, and Lamartinière, all of them coming from his\r\nown old command, and under officers who had long served in that army.\r\nTheir total strength was 17,235--many of the regiments were low in\r\nnumbers from the recent fighting in Biscay.\r\n\r\nEach of the three ‘lieutenancies’ had a light cavalry regiment attached\r\nto it--we should have called them corps-cavalry had the name been\r\npermitted. They were weak--only 808 sabres between the three--but\r\nsufficient for scouting purposes.\r\n\r\nAdding the two cavalry divisions of Pierre Soult (the Marshal’s very\r\nundistinguished but much cherished brother) and Treillard, the Army\r\nof Spain had 7,147 sabres, including the remnants of the foreign\r\ncavalry--Nassau Chasseurs, Spanish light horse, and Royal Guards, who\r\nwere something under 1,000 all told.\r\n\r\nThe very large body of troops under Villatte which Soult had left\r\noutside his nine marching divisions, and his three ‘lieutenancies’,\r\nconsisted of a great number of battalions of the recently abolished\r\narmies, which were left as a surplus, when the new formations had been\r\nbrought up to the six-regiment standard. They included of French troops\r\none odd battalion of the Army of Portugal, eleven of the Army of the\r\nNorth, and six of the old Bayonne Reserve. The eighteen battalions were\r\nmostly rather weak, and mustered only a little over 9,000 bayonets\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIn addition Villatte’s reserve included all the foreign\r\ntroops--Neuenstein’s _Rheinbund_ Germans, who had served so long\r\nin the Army of the Centre, St. Pol’s Italian brigade, the King’s\r\nFoot-Guards--a solid body of 2,000 infantry, all Frenchmen, though in\r\nSpanish uniform--and the forlorn remnant of the _Afrancesados_--three\r\ndwindling regiments under Casapalacios, which had shrunk from 2,000 to\r\n1,100 bayonets during the last month.\r\n\r\nAdding a battalion of foot-gendarmes from the evacuated Biscay\r\ngarrisons, and another of local National guards, Villatte had over\r\n17,000 infantry--a force as big as Reille’s or Clausel’s lieutenancies.\r\nThere was some weak stuff among them[842], but the greater part were\r\nexperienced troops in nowise inferior to the units of the marching\r\ndivisions. It is hard to see why Soult did not make up a tenth\r\ndivision out of the best of them: this would still have left Villatte\r\n12,000 men, and would have been very useful in the fighting army. But\r\napparently, as will be seen during the narrative of the campaign of\r\nJuly-August, he intended to use the Reserve in an active fashion, and\r\nwas foiled by the caution or timidity of Villatte, who discharged the\r\norders given him in a very half-hearted way. This mass of troops was\r\nreally quite capable of being used as a fighting unit--it had its four\r\nbatteries of field artillery, the foreign cavalry were allotted to\r\nit, and a proportion of sappers and engineers. Even after leaving a\r\ndetachment--say the _Afrancesados_ and one or two of the weakest French\r\nbattalions--to aid the conscripts to garrison Bayonne, it could have\r\ntaken the field with 15,000 men of all arms[843].\r\n\r\nTo assume the offensive with a recently beaten army is dangerous.\r\nMany of the regiments which Soult had to use had only a month before\r\nrecrossed the Pyrenees in a state of complete disorder: they had been\r\nentirely out of hand, and had been guilty of outrages among the French\r\npeasantry which recalled their worst doings in Spain. The greater\r\nnumber of the senior officers had applied for service in the Army of\r\nGermany the moment that they had crossed the frontier: it was refused\r\nto nearly all of them. The junior officers would have made similar\r\napplications, if they had thought that it would be of any use. Every\r\none of every rank was cursing King Joseph, luck, the weather, the\r\nsupply services, the War Ministry at Paris, and his own immediate\r\nhierarchical superior: a _sentiment d’ineptie générale_ prevailed[844].\r\nA great deal of this demoralization was mere nervous exhaustion,\r\nresulting from long marches and semi-starvation extending over many\r\nweeks. After a fortnight of comparative rest and more or less regular\r\nrations it commenced to subside. The whole army consisted of veteran\r\ntroops proud of their regimental honour and their past victories: they\r\nsoon persuaded themselves that they had never been given a fair chance\r\nin the recent campaign--Soult’s clever and malicious proclamation\r\nexactly hit off their state of mind. It was easy to lay all the blame\r\non bad generalship, and to plead that a good half of the troops had\r\nnot fought at Vittoria: in full force and under a competent leader\r\nthey would have made mincemeat of the ‘motley levies’ of Wellington.\r\nWhen the whole host was reassembled, after Clausel’s arrival, every\r\none could see that the numerical loss in the late disaster had been\r\nvery moderate: there were more French troops assembled on the Bidassoa\r\nthan any member of any of the armies had ever seen concentrated before.\r\nShame and anger replaced dejection in their minds: even the marauders\r\nand deserters came back to the Eagles by thousands. Soult wrote to the\r\nMinister of War that the disquieting state of indiscipline which he had\r\ndiscovered on his arrival was subsiding, that marauding had ceased with\r\nthe distribution of regular rations, and that the morale of the army\r\nwas satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe weakest part of the reorganization was, of course, the transport.\r\nThe army had lost all its wheeled vehicles and many of its animals in\r\nthe disaster of Vittoria: they had not been replaced in any adequate\r\nfashion during the four short weeks that followed. By extraordinary\r\nefforts the Commissariat had found food for every one, so long as the\r\nmain body of the army was encamped between Bayonne and the Bidassoa.\r\nBut it would be impossible to start it properly equipped for a long\r\nmountain campaign far from its base. Soult took the desperate risk\r\nof starting on July 23 with only four days’ rations in hand with the\r\nmarching columns: all that would be wanted later was to come up by\r\nsuccessive convoys sent out from the neighbourhood of Bayonne. And it\r\nwas little better with munitions for infantry and artillery alike. The\r\ncampaign became a time-problem: unless a decisive success were achieved\r\nwithin the first four or five days, there was grave danger of the army\r\nbeing brought to a stop. It would be helpless if it should have used\r\nup all its cartridges in several days of continuous and severe, but\r\nindecisive, fighting: or if bad weather should prevent the regular\r\nappearance of convoys from the rear. This Soult knew, but thought that\r\nhis arrangements were calculated to secure that quick and decisive\r\nvictory which would justify all taking of risks.\r\n\r\nThe plan of campaign which the Marshal chose was one of the three\r\nalternative schemes which the unlucky Jourdan had formulated during\r\nhis last days at the front[845]. It will be remembered that they were\r\n(1) to endeavour to raise the siege of St. Sebastian by massing every\r\navailable man on the Bidassoa, and striking at Giron and Graham--who\r\nwas wrongly supposed to have only one British division with him. After\r\ndriving back Graham as far as Tolosa on the high road, it would be\r\npossible to turn southward and relieve Pampeluna: Clausel’s corps,\r\nmeanwhile, should demonstrate in Navarre, to distract Wellington from\r\nsending his reserves from the south to the main point of danger.\r\nBoth Jourdan on July 5 and Soult on July 23rd believed, the former\r\ncorrectly, the latter wrongly, that there were three British divisions\r\nengaged in the blockade of Pampeluna.\r\n\r\n(2) To leave a corps of observation on the Bidassoa to contain\r\nGraham, while the rest of the army struck at Pampeluna by the route\r\nof Roncesvalles. This would have the advantage of raising the siege\r\nof that place at once, though the relief of St. Sebastian would be\r\ndeferred. But, Jourdan added, it had three disadvantages--the road was\r\nbad and might conceivably prove impracticable for artillery: the bulk\r\nof the British divisions would probably be found concentrated for a\r\nfight to cover the blockade: and Navarre was a country in which no army\r\ncould scrape together food enough to live upon.\r\n\r\n(3) To leave a corps of observation on the Bidassoa, and convey the\r\nrest of the army into Aragon, by the pass of Jaca, to join Suchet and\r\noperate with overwhelming forces on the Ebro against Wellington’s flank\r\nand rear. This, the operation which Jourdan regarded as the best of\r\nthe three, had since become impossible, because Paris had abandoned\r\nSaragossa, and Suchet had taken his army to Catalonia: on July 17 he\r\nwas at Tarragona.\r\n\r\nSoult’s plan was in essence Jourdan’s second alternative; but he\r\ncomplicated it by dividing the army which was to strike at Pampeluna\r\ninto two columns. Two-thirds of the whole (Reille and Clausel) was to\r\nmarch by the Roncesvalles passes; D’Erlon with the remainder was to\r\nforce the pass of Maya and to converge on Pampeluna by the Bastan and\r\nthe Col de Velate. Jourdan’s memorandum contained a special caution\r\nagainst the dissemination of columns, ‘je pense que toute opération de\r\nplusieurs corps isolés ne réussira pas.’ How frequently in military\r\nhistory two columns starting from distant bases have failed to meet\r\non the appointed day is known to every student. It is seldom that a\r\ncomplete success is secured--as at Königgrätz. Much more frequently the\r\nenemy against whom the concentration was planned has beaten one corps\r\nbefore the other--delayed by one of the uncountable chances of war--has\r\ncome upon the scene. And this was to be the case with Soult before\r\nPampeluna.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of Soult’s scheme were very comprehensible. The greatest\r\nwas that, owing to the existence of a first-class road from Bayonne\r\nto St. Jean-Pied-du-Port, he could concentrate the main body of his\r\narmy upon his extreme left wing long before Wellington could make the\r\ncorresponding counter-move. In the early days of the operation he could\r\ncalculate on having an immense superiority of force on the Roncesvalles\r\nfront. It was more doubtful what would happen on the third or fourth\r\nday, if Wellington divined his enemy’s plan at the first moment, and\r\nordered a general concentration before Pampeluna, as Jourdan had taken\r\nfor granted that he would. But Soult considered that he had found means\r\nto make such a concentration impossible, by sending D’Erlon and his\r\n20,000 men to pierce the allied left-centre at Maya, and to sweep down\r\nthe Bastan. If D’Erlon broke in on the first day, and got possession\r\nof the positions that dominate the road-system of the Bastan--Elizondo\r\nand the Col de Velate--the northern divisions of Wellington’s army\r\nwould only be able to join the southern divisions in front of Pampeluna\r\nby immense détours to the west--by Santesteban and the Pass of Donna\r\nMaria, or even by Tolosa and Yrurzun. In all human probability they\r\nwould arrive too late.\r\n\r\nThe British commander, as we shall see, did not divine Soult’s whole\r\npurpose at the first moment, and therefore his general concentration\r\nwas ordered a day later than it might have been. And the officers who\r\nwere in charge of his extreme right at Roncesvalles gave way quicker\r\nthan he had intended. The campaign became a most interesting time\r\nproblem, which was settled in favour of Wellington in the end, by the\r\nfact that his first-arriving northern reserves got to the positions in\r\nfront of Pampeluna a day before Soult’s secondary column under D’Erlon\r\ncame into touch with the French main body. The subordinate officers\r\non both sides made some extraordinary mistakes, which compromised the\r\nplans of their superiors: the worst of them were in the line of slow\r\nand irregular transmission of news, which in a mountain country, where\r\nall side communications were difficult, and no general view of the\r\nsituation could be taken by the commander’s own eye, sometimes led to\r\nruinous miscalculations at head-quarters. It cannot be said that one\r\nside suffered more than the other from this negligence of subordinates.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the details. Soult’s left wing at St. Jean-Pied-du-Port\r\nwas ready to start, Conroux and Clausel’s old divisions having been\r\ncantoned in the neighbourhood of that fortress ever since they arrived\r\nin France; they were only one long march from their objective, the\r\ngap of Roncesvalles. At the other end of the line, D’Erlon’s three\r\ndivisions were also within one long march of the Pass of Maya--they\r\nalready lay with their vanguard at Urdax and their last rear brigade at\r\nEspelette. The difficulty lay with the third ‘lieutenancy’; Reille’s\r\nthree divisions of the old Army of Portugal on July 20th were on the\r\nlower Bidassoa, holding the front opposite Graham and Giron; they had\r\nto be got to St. Jean-Pied-du-Port, to join Clausel and co-operate\r\nin the main attack[846]. To draw them out of their existing positions\r\nwithout arousing too much attention at Wellington’s head-quarters was\r\ncomparatively easy. On the night of the 19th-20th four brigades of\r\nVillatte’s reserve replaced Reille’s troops at the outposts. On the\r\nfollowing day the three fighting divisions concentrated at St. Jean de\r\nLuz and started to march eastward, with orders to cross the Nive at\r\nCambo, and to get into the great _chaussée_ by Urcaray and Hellette,\r\nwhich leads to St. Jean-Pied-du-Port. Drawing up a far too optimistic\r\ntime-chart, Soult had hoped that they would all be in the neighbourhood\r\nof St. Jean-Pied-du-Port by the morning of the 22nd. As the distance\r\nwas not less than 50 miles, this would have been very hard work in\r\nany case, for a long column marching with a large train of artillery,\r\nas Reille was bringing up beside his own pieces three batteries for\r\nClausel, who had arrived gunless from Aragon. But the main cause of\r\ndelay was quite different: though the Bayonne-St. Jean-Pied-du-Port\r\n_chaussée_ was excellent, the local cross-road from St. Jean de Luz by\r\nSt. Pée to the bridge of Cambo was not, and torrential rains on the\r\n20th made it into a quagmire[847]. The troops got on very slowly, and\r\nat night the bridge at Cambo was carried away by a spate, leaving the\r\nbulk of Lamartinière’s division on the wrong side of the water. It was\r\nrepaired; but the general result was that the head of Reille’s column\r\nonly neared its destination late at night on the 22nd, while the rear\r\ndivision and the guns did not get up till the 24th. The Marshal had\r\nbeen waiting for them since the morning of the 21st, and had hoped to\r\nstart operations on the 23rd. He had been joined by his two cavalry\r\ndivisions, brought up from their cantonments between the Nive and the\r\nAdour on that day, so that Reille’s delays put the movement of all the\r\nother corps a day late.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Soult was able to commence moving up both Clausel’s and\r\nReille’s columns toward the Roncesvalles gap, so that they should be\r\nable to attack it on the 25th at an early hour. D’Erlon, being already\r\nin position in front of Maya, was only waiting for the signal to\r\nmarch. Villatte had been given orders which left a good deal to his\r\nprivate judgement, to the effect that he must simulate an offensive\r\nattitude on the Bidassoa front, but make no real attack till he knew\r\nthat D’Erlon had got well forward in the Bastan and that Graham’s flank\r\nwas threatened. He might then push the latter with confidence, as the\r\nallied troops on the coast would have to give way, and to raise the\r\nsiege of St. Sebastian, if their centre in the Bastan had been broken\r\nand driven westward.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find in a dispatch which Soult sent to Paris on\r\nthe 23rd his estimate of the position of Wellington’s line of defence.\r\nHe starts fairly well--Graham with the 1st Division is on the heights\r\nbeyond the Bidassoa: Oswald with the 5th Division and a Spanish (it\r\nshould be a Portuguese) corps besieges St. Sebastian. The 7th Division\r\nunder Lord Dalhousie holds the front Vera-Echalar. Then comes a curious\r\nblunder--the 6th Division under General Hay is on the (French) left of\r\nthe 7th Division. Really it was in reserve at Santesteban, and under\r\nPack; Clinton, who had only taken over command after long sick leave on\r\nJune 22nd, having again fallen ill. General Hill, with the 2nd Division\r\nunder W. Stewart, and Hamilton’s Portuguese (Silveira had superseded\r\nHamilton many months back) is in the Bastan, and holds ‘with camps and\r\nbatteries’ the passes of Maya and Ispegui. We are assured that the\r\n3rd and 4th Divisions and a Spanish corps are besieging Pampeluna.\r\n‘There seems to be another division (probably the 8th Division) under\r\na General Bird in position at Altobiscar, above Roncesvalles. There is\r\nan English (Portuguese) brigade under General Campbell in the Alduides.\r\nThe Spaniards of the Army of Galicia guard the Bidassoa from Vera to\r\nthe sea.’\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this reconstruction of Wellington’s line makes\r\nthe covering force in front of Pampeluna too weak, for it is believed\r\nto consist of ‘Bird’s’ division (a mistake for Byng’s brigade?) and\r\nthe force of Campbell in the Val de Alduides only. Really the Conde de\r\nAbispal’s Andalusians had relieved the 3rd and 4th Divisions on July\r\n16-17, and they were free, and disposable as a reserve to the troops\r\non the Roncesvalles front--Picton being at Olague in the valley of\r\nthe Lanz, Cole at Viscarret on the Pampeluna-Roncesvalles road: Pack\r\nand the 6th Division at Santesteban were only a little farther away.\r\nMoreover, Morillo’s Spaniards were up in line with Byng. The Light\r\nDivision makes no appearance in Soult’s table, unless he means the 8th\r\nDivision under ‘General Bird’ to represent it.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore a grave miscalculation when Soult ends by informing\r\nClarke that, after examining the whole Allied line, he has come to the\r\nconclusion that the right wing is the weak point, and the one that\r\nshould be attacked, by a flank movement which he will continue till\r\nhe has turned its rear. If Wellington’s plans had worked out well,\r\nthere would have happened what Jourdan had foreseen, viz. so vigorous\r\na resistance in the passes by the British outlying troops, that Soult\r\nwould only have arrived in front of Pampeluna to find the main bulk of\r\nWellington’s army offering him battle in front of the besieged city.\r\nBut, as we shall see, Cole and Picton received Wellington’s orders just\r\ntoo late to allow them to carry out the policy which he dictated.\r\n\r\nSuch were Soult’s views of Wellington’s situation. It remains to be\r\nseen what Wellington made of Soult’s intentions. He was from the\r\nfirst conscious that the Marshal’s appearance might mean a prompt\r\nresumption of the offensive by the enemy[848]. And the movements of\r\nthe French were reported to him with very fair accuracy and dispatch.\r\nAs early as the 22nd he was aware that the enemy was weakening his\r\nfront on the Bidassoa, and that troops were accumulating at St.\r\nJean-Pied-du-Port[849]. On the 24th he knew that the force moved in\r\nthat direction must be the larger half of the French army. But his\r\njudgement on the meaning of this movement was entirely coloured by the\r\nfact that he had breached St. Sebastian, and that he believed, like\r\nGraham, that it would be stormed successfully on the 24th or 25th.\r\nHe also knew that Soult was being informed, day by day, of the state\r\nof the fortress. On the other hand, he was aware that Pampeluna was\r\nquite safe--it had food enough to last for several weeks at least, and\r\nhe was not pressing it hard, as he was pressing St. Sebastian. From\r\nthis he deduced the conclusion that Soult could not in honour suffer\r\nSt. Sebastian to be taken almost under his eyes, as it would be unless\r\nhe intervened. Therefore the moving of troops--even large numbers of\r\ntroops--towards St. Jean-Pied-du-Port, must be a feint, because the\r\nMarshal’s obvious duty was to save St. Sebastian--while Pampeluna was\r\nin no danger. He read the French manœuvres as an attempt to distract\r\nhis attention from the Bidassoa. And his idea that a desperate attempt\r\nwould be made to relieve St. Sebastian seemed to be borne out by the\r\nfact that Villatte was making flying bridges at Urogne, and that French\r\nboats were running in to the mouth of the Bidassoa from St. Jean de\r\nLuz. Still, if reports were correct, the enemy was likely to make\r\na very serious demonstration on the Roncesvalles front. Wellington\r\ntherefore wrote to Cole on the 23rd that he was not to allow himself\r\nto be pushed in too easily towards Pampeluna. ‘You should support\r\nMajor-General Byng in the defence of the passes as effectually as you\r\ncan, without committing his troops and the 4th Division against a force\r\nso superior that the advantage of the ground would not compensate\r\nit. You will be good enough to make arrangements further back also,\r\nfor stopping the enemy’s progress toward Pampeluna, in the event of\r\nyour being compelled to give up the passes which General Byng now\r\noccupies.... A sure communication should exist with General Sir Thomas\r\nPicton, and Sir Thomas should be apprised of any movement of troops,\r\neither upon the Roncesvalles road, or upon that of Eugui and the\r\nAlduides, in order that he may make such arrangements as circumstances\r\nmay dictate for giving support, should such an event occur.... It is\r\ndesirable that you should transmit a daily report for the present to\r\nHead Quarters[850].’\r\n\r\nThis was followed up by even more stringent orders on the following\r\nday. George Murray wrote to Cole, ‘Lord Wellington has desired that\r\nI should express still more strongly how essential he considers it\r\nthat the passes in front of Roncesvalles should be maintained to the\r\nutmost. And I am to direct you to be so good as to make every necessary\r\narrangement for repelling effectually any direct attack that the enemy\r\nmay make in that quarter.... Lord Wellington attaches very little\r\nimportance to any wider turning movement which the enemy might make\r\nupon our right. The difficulties and delays of any wider movement are\r\nconsiderable obstacles, and would retard him sufficiently to give time\r\nto make other arrangements to stop his progress[851].’\r\n\r\nIt would be most inaccurate to say that Wellington was surprised by\r\nSoult’s offensive at the southern end of his line, as these orders\r\nsufficiently demonstrate. At the same time he remained till late on\r\nthe night of the 25th firmly convinced that the French move in Navarre\r\nwas a feint or subsidiary operation, and that the real attack would be\r\non the Bidassoa. On the 24th, knowing of the accumulation of hostile\r\ntroops before Roncesvalles, he wrote to Graham that undoubtedly the\r\nenemy is very strong on that side, ‘but only because he entertains\r\nserious designs to draw away our attention from the side of Irun,\r\nand then to attempt to pass the river[852].’ And on the same morning\r\nhe wrote to Giron that ‘the enemy’s main force has moved towards St.\r\nJean-Pied-du-Port; but his two pontoon bridges remain at Urogne. It\r\nwould seem that he intends to distract our attention to the other\r\nside, and then to make a try at the river. But as (at 11 a.m.) I no\r\nlonger hear the guns at St. Sebastian, I am hoping that its business\r\nhas been settled[853].’ It will be remembered that the projected storm\r\non the 24th had been postponed because of the conflagration, so that\r\nthe cessation of the firing had not the happy meaning that Wellington\r\nattributed to it.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 25th, when the unsuccessful attempt on St.\r\nSebastian was actually made, Wellington was up at early dawn, listening\r\nonce more to the guns, as he strode up and down in the churchyard of\r\nLesaca. Again they stopped, after two hours of furious fire, just as\r\non the preceding day; and again Wellington hoped that ‘the business\r\nhad been settled’--that the French scheme (as he conceived it) had\r\nbeen foiled, because there was now no garrison at St. Sebastian left\r\nfor Soult to relieve. But ere noon there arrived a dejected messenger\r\nto report that there had been this time no postponed assault, but a\r\nserious attack defeated with very heavy loss. This unhappy fact upset\r\nall Wellington’s calculations: if the failure had been very disastrous,\r\nit would result that St. Sebastian must be reckoned as in no immediate\r\ndanger; and Soult’s heavy demonstration in front of Roncesvalles might\r\nprove to be no feint, but a real attempt to relieve Pampeluna. Yet\r\nWellington still doubted this interpretation of the enemy’s move: ‘one\r\ncan hardly believe that with 30,000 men he proposes to force himself\r\nthrough the passes of the mountains. The remainder of his force, one\r\nmust think, must come into operation on some other point, either\r\nto-morrow or the day after[854].’ In fact he still opined that there\r\nwould be an assault on the Bidassoa--not understanding that the enemy’s\r\nsurplus, or the greater part of it--D’Erlon’s column of 21,000 men--was\r\nstriking at the Maya Pass, and was in possession of it at the moment\r\nwhen he wrote this dispatch to Graham.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great thing was to discover exactly what was the\r\ncondition of affairs at St. Sebastian, and Wellington rode over the\r\nhills in haste to visit Graham, before any notice of the attacks of\r\nthe French at Maya and at Roncesvalles had come to hand. He spent a\r\nlong afternoon opposite the fortress, with the results that have been\r\nexplained in the preceding chapter. It was only on his ride back to\r\nLesaca in the dark that he met the first messenger of evil. His Chief\r\nof the Staff, George Murray, had sent out an officer to tell him that\r\nfurious firing had been audible from the side of the Maya passes all\r\nthrough the afternoon. But no explanatory dispatch had been received\r\neither from W. Stewart in command at Maya itself, or from Hill, in\r\ncharge of the whole defence of the Bastan. This was astonishing, as\r\nthere was a properly established line of communication along the Bastan\r\nto head-quarters; rumours had come to hand that the enemy was stopped,\r\nbut no official report. On reaching Lesaca an hour later, Wellington\r\nfound an officer sent by Cole from Roncesvalles awaiting him, who\r\nbrought the news that the French were attacking on that front in\r\noverpowering numbers. But up to midday, when the messenger had started,\r\nno breach had been made in the British line[855].\r\n\r\nLate at night news did finally come from the Maya front. Stewart\r\nsent a verbal message that he had lost the pass, and though he had\r\nregained it for a moment by the aid of a brigade of the 7th Division,\r\nHill had ordered him to fall back. This was confirmed by a letter from\r\nHill, which said that Stewart had been driven out of the pass, but that\r\nthey were going to try to hold on in a position at Elizondo, ten miles\r\nfarther down the Bastan. It was owing to absolutely criminal negligence\r\non the part of his subordinates that Wellington learned the details of\r\na fight that had begun at about 11 a.m., only twenty miles away, at no\r\nearlier an hour than 10 p.m. But late as it was, he had now at last the\r\ninformation which enabled him to guess at Soult’s general design, and\r\nto give orders for dealing with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Country between BAYONNE & PAMPLONA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII: CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRONCESVALLES AND MAYA\r\n\r\n\r\nSoult, though a day later than he had intended, was ready for his great\r\nstroke at the passes by dawn on July 25th. The main blow was to be\r\ndelivered on the Roncesvalles front, where he had the 34,000 infantry\r\nof Reille and Clausel assembled, not to speak of the two cavalry\r\ndivisions, which would only become useful when he should reach the\r\nplain of Pampeluna. So much was D’Erlon’s attack on the Maya passes the\r\nsecondary part of the scheme, that we find Soult informing that general\r\nthat his advance would probably be facilitated by the arrival in the\r\nenemy’s camp of the news that Roncesvalles had been forced: this would\r\ncompel Hill to fall back down the Bastan, and he should be pursued as\r\nbriskly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Roncesvalles business was therefore the more important part of\r\nthe programme for July 25th. The Marshal had chosen for the routes of\r\nClausel and Reille two roads, which climb up from St. Jean-Pied-du-Port\r\nand the valley of the Nive to the bleak plateau above the historic\r\nabbey, where the relics of Roland were still shown. Between them lies a\r\nbroad and deep valley, the Val Carlos, with the mountain stream called\r\nthe Nive d’Arneguy running down its middle. The eastern road climbs\r\nthe slopes to the (French) left of the valley: it was practicable for\r\nartillery and vehicles, and sappers had been working for the last few\r\ndays to improve some of its more tiresome curves. This road, after\r\npassing the Venta d’Orisson, the last inhabited spot on the north\r\nslope, and the ruined fort of Château Pignon, comes to the crest\r\nunder a hill called Leiçaratheca, immediately in front of the higher\r\nposition called Altobiscar, where the watershed lies. It then passes\r\nfor a mile along this watershed known as the ridge of Ibaneta, and\r\ndescends by curves to the abbey on the Spanish side. The other road, no\r\nmore than a mountain track in 1813, and quite impracticable for guns\r\nor transport, climbs uphill on the western slopes of the Val Carlos,\r\nonly three or four miles from the better route as the crow flies, but\r\nalways separated from it by the broad and deep intervening combe. After\r\npassing the village of Arneguy, it gets up on to the narrow crest of\r\nthe mountain, the Airola, which separates the Val Carlos from the Val\r\nHaira, the next valley westward. Along this ridge it winds for five or\r\nsix miles, till the crest joins the main watershed of the Pyrenees at\r\na small plateau called the Linduz, about two miles or so west of the\r\npoint on the Ibaneta ridge where the other road comes in. A practicable\r\ntrack along the watershed joins them. Since 1813 the whole of the\r\nroad-geography of this stretch of the Pyrenees has been changed, by the\r\nconstruction of a metalled _chaussée_ from Arneguy up the Val Carlos,\r\nwhich did not exist in 1813: it goes along the slopes, not along the\r\nactual crest, like the mere track which Reille’s men had to follow on\r\nJuly 25th, and is now a better route than the old high road by Venta\r\nd’Orisson and Château Pignon. From the Linduz there is a steep path\r\ngoing straight down into Spain, without joining the Roncesvalles road:\r\nit is called the Puerto de Mendichuri, and leads to Espinal. The little\r\nplateau has yet another exit; along the crests to its west comes in\r\na very bad track from the valley of the Alduides, named the path of\r\nAtalosti. It is because it lay at such a ganglion of joining ridges,\r\nthat the Linduz was marked by a ruined earthwork--a relic of the war of\r\n1793-4.\r\n\r\nTo understand the general lie of the fighting ground, it must be\r\nremembered that from the Linduz to Altobiscar is about three miles of\r\nsaddle-back ridge, lowest in the middle, where the _chaussée_ crosses\r\nthe sky-line at 3,600 feet above sea-level, while the highest point of\r\nthe Linduz is about 4,200, and that of Altobiscar about 4,900 feet up.\r\nThe descent into France is much steeper than that into Spain--Burguete\r\nand Espinal are only 700 feet below the summit of the pass, Arneguy\r\nand the village of Val Carlos on the French side 3,000 feet below it.\r\nThis is the reason that caused Soult to send his right column along\r\nthe lofty path on the Airola ridge, from which they could approach the\r\nLinduz on a level, instead of bidding them climb up direct from the\r\ndeep-sunk bottom of the Val Carlos trough.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the scenery of the three miles of the\r\nRoncesvalles front is not precipitous or Alpine. There are some\r\noutcrops of rock in certain places--e. g. along the front of the\r\nLeiçaratheca hill, but the prevailing aspect is rather like that of\r\nScottish highland scenery on a large scale. The slopes are mostly short\r\nslippery grass, not unclimbable for a good walker, though difficult for\r\nthe soldier of 1813 carrying the 70 lb. of his fighting kit and heavy\r\nknapsack. The lower skirts of the hills are covered in many parts with\r\nwoods of pine and beech and stunted undergrowth of oak: in some places\r\nthese stretch up right to the summits--the Linduz has thick foliage on\r\nits eastern flank, and the ridge leading to it from the Airola spur\r\nhas trees on both sides of the narrow track which winds along its\r\ncrest, so that troops ascending it are only intermittently visible.\r\nMuch of the Ibaneta position--the central saddle between the Linduz\r\nand Altobiscar--is covered with bush. But from the highest summits\r\nthere are long and clear views over the woods and the grass-slopes\r\nalike--views much more commanding, it may be noted, toward the French\r\nthan toward the Spanish side. So striking is the general effect that,\r\neven on the morning of battle, it fixed itself on the minds of several\r\nof the combatants as a memory not to be forgotten[856]: fighting has\r\nseldom taken place with such a broad and majestic horizon.\r\n\r\nSoult knew that his attack would be expected on the high\r\nroad--Clausel’s troops had been visible to Byng’s outposts for some\r\ntime, and on the night of the 24th there had been a slight skirmish of\r\npicquets between the Leiçaratheca and Château-Pignon. But he was under\r\nthe impression that he would take the enemy entirely by surprise in\r\nhis second attack, that directed against the Linduz by the obscure and\r\ndifficult path along the crest of the Airola mountain, which since the\r\nwar of 1793-4 had only been used by shepherds and smugglers. And on to\r\nthis narrow path he pushed the full half of his infantry--the whole\r\nof Reille’s three divisions. It is probable that we must write down\r\nthe whole of this movement as a mistake: the track was so bad that it\r\ncould only be used by daylight--at night it would have been impossible\r\nto discover the way, among steep slopes and thickets. There were so\r\nmany ups and downs, and the grass slopes on each side were so slippery,\r\nthat nothing could be done in the dark. The actual result was that\r\nthe whole 17,000 bayonets of Reille advanced with a front of two men,\r\nor even in Indian file, forming a sort of procession many miles long.\r\nThe head battalion was fighting hard on the Linduz before the tail\r\nbattalion had begun to stir from Arneguy. Reille had made over his\r\nbatteries and his regiment of corps-cavalry to Clausel, receiving in\r\nreturn eight mountain guns carried by mules, and a train of pack-beasts\r\nladen with infantry ammunition. It is obvious that a movement of this\r\nsort could only succeed if the enemy was surprised, since the column\r\nhad no thrusting-power; it was all length without breadth, and one\r\nbrigade ready at the Linduz might hold up the entire three divisions,\r\nwhich would have no space to deploy so as to make their numbers felt.\r\nThis, as we shall see, is precisely what happened: the Linduz was found\r\nin British occupation, and Reille was blocked for the whole day in\r\nfront of a very inferior force.\r\n\r\nOn the Château Pignon-Altobiscar road Soult had sent forward the whole\r\nof Clausel’s force, the three divisions one behind the other, in the\r\norder Vandermaesen-Taupin-Conroux. Behind the last infantry division\r\nwas the cavalry, and then all the guns and transport. Everything on\r\nwheels belonging to Reille had been put in at the tail of Clausel’s\r\nimpedimenta. This made a column of interminable length. The conditions\r\nwere better for an advance on this front than on the western track,\r\nsince the road was broad and the slopes on each side of it fairly\r\npracticable: but there were formidable positions to be carried before\r\nthe watershed could be reached.\r\n\r\nByng and Morillo had been for three weeks at the Roncesvalles passes,\r\nbut it was only eight days since they had been put under the command\r\nof Cole, who had come up with the 4th Division from his long stay in\r\nfront of Pampeluna. And it was only on the 22nd that Wellington had\r\nsent to Cole the warning that the French main body was moving toward\r\nSt. Jean-Pied-du-Port, and that he might expect to be attacked. On the\r\n23rd Cole received the stringent orders which have been quoted on an\r\nearlier page, but the still stronger message of the 24th seems only to\r\nhave reached him after the fighting had begun.\r\n\r\nWhile Byng and Morillo were in charge they had evidently counted on\r\nbeing attacked along the high-road, and possibly also in the depths\r\nof the Val Carlos. But no serious attempt had been made to cover the\r\nhighland path that comes out on the Linduz, much farther west. It was\r\nonly watched by a picquet--one company of Morillo’s men encamped in\r\nthe ruined redoubt of 1793 on the Linduz. The other points of access\r\nwere carefully blocked: Byng had a strong first line of defence\r\non the Leiçaratheca hill, whose rocky upper face gave good cover\r\nfor skirmishers. It was held by the three light companies of his\r\nbrigade, the attached company of the 5/60th and one battalion[857]\r\nand three light companies from Morillo’s right-hand brigade. Two\r\nmiles behind was the real fighting position, occupied by the Buffs\r\nand the ‘1st Provisional’ (2/31st and 2/66th), with two of Morillo’s\r\nbattalions[858]. Byng’s third battalion, the 1/57th, was detached far\r\ndownhill to the left, on the lower slopes of the Altobiscar, watching\r\nthe Val Carlos. The third Spanish battalion of Morillo’s right-hand\r\nbrigade, Leon, was detached in a similar fashion to the right, to the\r\nfoot of the Altobiscar heights, to guard a by-path, which crosses the\r\nmain chain of the mountains and comes down into the upper valley of the\r\nIrati river at the foundry of Orbaiceta.\r\n\r\nThe remaining battalions of Morillo’s left-hand brigade[859] were down\r\nin the Val Carlos, on ground south of the village of the same name,\r\nin a position blocking the upper and higher end of that deep-sunk\r\ndepression. They covered the flank of the Altobiscar heights, and were\r\nnot far from the 1/57th. Their line of retreat, if they should be\r\npushed, was up a very steep path, which comes into the _chaussée_ on\r\nthe Ibaneta ridge[860]. It was this brigade which supplied the picquet\r\non the Linduz, the only precaution taken to cover the extreme left of\r\nthe Allies’ fighting ground. The whole force on the front originally\r\nconsisted of 2,000 bayonets of Byng’s brigade and 3,800 in Morillo’s\r\nsix battalions.\r\n\r\nWhen Cole took over from Byng the general responsibility for the safety\r\nof the eastern passes, he brought up his head-quarters to Viscarret\r\nin the valley of the Erro, but placed his first British brigade, that\r\nof Ross, at Espinal, in the valley of the Urrobi, on the high road to\r\nRoncesvalles, only five miles from the abbey and the ‘Puerto’, and\r\nthree from the pass of Mendichuri leading up to the Linduz. He was thus\r\nin a position to reinforce the passes at two or three hours’ notice\r\nwith one brigade, and with his whole 6,000 bayonets in half a day’s\r\nmarch. On the night of the 24th, having received both Wellington’s\r\nfirst letter of warning and Byng’s report that his picquets had been\r\nattacked, Cole resolved to bring up his reserves nearer to the front.\r\nBy the most fortunate of inspirations he directed Ross’s brigade to\r\nmarch before dawn--at 2 a.m.--and to occupy the head of the Mendichuri\r\npass and the Linduz.\r\n\r\nRoss, obeying orders all the more readily because he had just received\r\nSpanish information that the Linduz was going to be attacked next\r\nday[861], moved off in the dark, and mounted the Mendichuri, much\r\nincommoded on the way by sharp turns where trees had been blown down in\r\na recent storm, and cumbered the path. He had the 20th with him: the\r\n7th was following: the 23rd was left behind at Espinal, to start by\r\ndaylight and bring on the baggage. Though the distance to the Linduz\r\nwas only three miles, it took in the darkness more than four hours to\r\nreach the summit[862]. There everything was found quiet at dawn--the\r\nSpanish picquet in the old redoubt indeed was so sleepy that Ross and\r\nhis staff rode into them without having been challenged[863]. Dawn had\r\nnow come; though nothing suspicious had been observed, the general sent\r\nout the Brunswick-Oels company attached to the brigade to reconnoitre\r\nalong the spur in front, while the 20th piled arms and lay down on the\r\nsummit, to eat and get some rest after the night march. In the far\r\ndistance to the north-west the tents of Campbell’s Portuguese, encamped\r\non the farther side of the Alduides valley were perfectly visible. But\r\nshortly after 6 o’clock distant musketry began to be heard from the\r\nother flank--the direction of the Leiçaratheca--where the busy day’s\r\nwork was just beginning. It was some time, however, before Ross’s\r\nbrigade came in for their share of it.\r\n\r\nSoult’s attack, as we have seen, was delivered by two columns each of\r\n17,000 men, and each striking by one narrow road at a vital point of\r\nthe enemy’s defences. There was practically no dispersion of forces\r\non subsidiary enterprises, for the two demonstrations which he made\r\non his flanks on the morning of the 25th were trifling affairs. To\r\ndistract the attention of Campbell’s brigade in the Alduides, he\r\ndirected all the National Guards of the Val de Baigorry and the other\r\nwestern valleys to assemble on the mountain called Hausa, opposite\r\nthe Portuguese camp, to light many fires there, as if they marked the\r\nbivouacs of a large force, and to show themselves at many points.\r\nLittle good came of this to the National Guards, for Campbell, an\r\nactive officer, marched at them without delay, and drove them in\r\nhelpless rout down the valley. But Soult (unlike the unfortunate local\r\nlevy) profited perceptibly from the move, for the noise of firing drew\r\ndown to the Alduides the two British generals responsible for the\r\nBastan--Hill and W. Stewart. And while they were absent, off their own\r\nground, their troops at Maya were attacked, and suffered many things\r\nfor want of a commander.\r\n\r\nA second similar demonstration was made in the valley east of\r\nRoncesvalles. Here the local National Guards, backed by a battalion of\r\nthe 59th under Colonel Loverdo, crossed the main chain of the mountains\r\nand attacked Morillo’s right flank-guard--the regiment of Leon--at\r\nthe foundry of Orbaiceta in the Irati valley. The Spaniards defended\r\nthemselves stoutly, and held their ground all day. But the noise of\r\nthis skirmishing far to their right rear was decidedly trying to the\r\nnerves of Byng and Morillo, who for some time could not be certain\r\nthat their flank had not been turned by a respectable force. However,\r\nnothing came of this skirmish, since it grew evident by the afternoon\r\nthat the enemy was weak and unable to press forward. It is barely\r\nworth putting on record that one battalion detached from the tail of\r\nConroux’s division, went up the trough of the Val Carlos, and watched\r\nMorillo’s left-hand brigade without attempting to close with it.\r\n\r\nHaving dismissed these feints, concerning which no more need be said,\r\nwe may proceed to the real fighting. At about 6 a.m. Vandermaesen’s\r\ndivision, at the head of Clausel’s long column, neared the hill of\r\nLeiçaratheca, where the seven British and Spanish light companies were\r\nensconced in the rocky slope commanding the high road. The position had\r\nobviously to be stormed by frontal attack if there was reason to hurry,\r\nfor it could only be turned by very long flanking movements over the\r\nsteep slopes on each side of the road. General Barbot, commanding the\r\nleading brigade, deployed the 1st Line and 25th Léger, and attacked\r\nwith a swarm of _tirailleurs_ the whole front of the hill. The attack\r\nfailed completely, the defenders being under good cover and perfectly\r\nsteady. The French, when their first rush had been stopped, threw\r\nthemselves down among the stones and gorse, and kept up a useless fire\r\nupon their almost invisible adversaries. Clausel, after three hours\r\nof this profitless bickering, sent in high rage a message to Barbot,\r\nthat he would have him cashiered, unless he pulled his men together\r\nand delivered a serious attack[864]. Meanwhile the French battalions\r\nwere coming up one after another from the rear, and accumulating behind\r\nthe single brigade that was engaged. Barbot called back his disordered\r\ntroops, re-formed them in column, put in a fresh battalion, and made\r\na second and a third attack on the hill: all naturally failed--the\r\ntroops being tired and discouraged. But the matter was finally settled\r\nby the divisional general, Vandermaesen, leading off his three rear\r\nbattalions[865] across the steep hillside to the east, and turning the\r\nLeiçaratheca by a long détour. At the same time Clausel began to shell\r\nthe position with six guns brought up from the rear. When Byng saw his\r\noutlying force in danger of being cut off, he ordered it to retire to\r\nhis main body on the Altobiscar. This it did in good time, and when\r\nClausel again advanced against the Leiçaratheca frontally, with the\r\n50th-Line, while the flanking column drew in on the right flank, he\r\nreceived only a few shots from lingering skirmishers, and occupied the\r\nposition with the loss of 9 men killed only.\r\n\r\nSo long had the turning movement taken, that by the time that the\r\nFrench had got back into order again, and could advance towards\r\nByng’s real fighting ground, it was past 3 o’clock in the afternoon.\r\nThe Altobiscar position was even more formidable than that on the\r\nLeiçaratheca; Clausel looked at it, felt it, and did not like it:\r\nit was impossible to turn save by a vast détour: this, he says in\r\nhis dispatch, he was preparing to do, by sending his rear division\r\n(Conroux) to circumvent the whole crest of Altobiscar and the still\r\nhigher summit to the east of the road, a march of many miles. But at 5\r\no’clock a dense mountain fog rose, the enemies became invisible to each\r\nother, and all movement became impossible. Byng was left unattacked\r\nupon his chosen position--though not destined to stop there. The losses\r\non both sides had been absurdly small, considering that 17,000 French\r\nhad faced 6,000 British and Spaniards for eleven hours. But really only\r\nVandermaesen’s division on one side and the Allied light companies on\r\nthe other had been engaged. Clausel says that he had but 160 killed\r\nand wounded--among the last General Vandermaesen himself[866]. Byng\r\nand Morillo had 120 casualties--the former remarks that this was an\r\nextraordinarily low figure considering that the French had shelled the\r\nLeiçaratheca for some time--but the cover was good[867]. There were\r\nmore Spaniards hurt than British: their conduct had been exemplary.\r\nMorillo himself had been there, exposing himself with his usual\r\nreckless courage.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the line the fighting was much more serious. It\r\nwill be remembered that at 6 o’clock Ross was on the Linduz, with\r\nhis leading battalion, and a second close behind: the third had only\r\nrecently started the climb up from Espinal by the Mendichuri. He sent\r\nout his light companies to observe the northern slope of the plateau\r\nwhich he had occupied, that of Brunswick-Oels being directed along the\r\nwooded spur or crest which forms the western wall of the depression of\r\nthe Val Carlos. Meanwhile the troops listened to the commencement of\r\nthe long roll of musketry, which told how Clausel was attacking Byng on\r\nthe other side of that valley. Three or four hours passed; General Cole\r\nrode by on his way to visit the Roncesvalles front, told Ross to keep\r\na good look-out, and informed him that Anson’s and Stubbs’s brigade\r\nwere coming up via Burguete, the former to reinforce the Spaniards at\r\nthe foundry of Orbaiceta, the latter to the Ibaneta to support Byng.\r\nSomewhere about 11 o’clock, according to our best eye-witness, the\r\noutlying picquet of the Brunswick company detected dust rolling above\r\nthe beech copses which masked the crest-path in front of them, and a\r\nlittle later caught intermittent glimpses of troops passing between the\r\ntrees. It was doubted whether they were French, or some of Morillo’s\r\ntroops retiring from Val Carlos. But about noon, Ross, having been\r\nwarned to look for trouble, told the Brunswickers to advance and verify\r\nthe character of the approaching strangers, while he himself called up\r\nthe left wing of the 20th regiment and followed in support: the rest\r\nof the brigade were directed to stand to their arms on the Linduz.\r\nThe German light company went forward some half a mile on a very\r\nup-and-down track, till they got quite close to the oncoming troops,\r\nwho appeared to be in no particular order, a straggling crowd advancing\r\nalong the crest, which is here only thirty yards broad, with trees\r\nand bushes on both flanks. When there was no more than eighty yards\r\nbetween the parties the French dressed their front, so as to cover\r\nthe whole breadth of the ridge, and began to fire. They were the two\r\n_compagnies d’élite_ of the 6th Léger, the leading battalion of Foy’s\r\ndivision, at the head of Reille’s column; close behind them the rest\r\nof their battalion was pushing up, as quickly as was possible with\r\nmen moving on such a narrow track. The sixty Brunswickers, finding\r\nthemselves in front of such a superior force, fell back, firing, on\r\ntheir supports, pursued by the enemy. General Ross, wanting to gain\r\ntime for his brigade on the Linduz to deploy, ordered the leading\r\ncompany of the 20th--No. 8, Captain Tovey’s--to charge with the bayonet\r\nand throw the French back. There followed one of the rarest things in\r\nthe Peninsular War, a real hand-to-hand fight with the white weapon.\r\nThe French skirmishers in front gave way into the bushes, clearing the\r\nfront of the company behind them. Then the two parties, each advancing\r\nup one side of a small declivity, met face to face at the top, with\r\nonly ten yards between them when they came in sight of each other. ‘The\r\nFrench instinctively stepped back a pace,’ says the Brunswick officer\r\nwho has left us the best account of this clash, ‘several of them made\r\na half turn, as if about to give way; but their officers, some with\r\nappeals, some with threats, and some with curses, kept them to their\r\nwork. They stood firm, and their bayonets came down to the charge: so\r\ndid those of Tovey’s company. For a few seconds the two sides surveyed\r\neach other at a distance of two paces: then one French company officer\r\nsprang forward into the middle of the British, and began cutting right\r\nand left. He was at once bayoneted, and then the two sides began to\r\nfence cautiously with each other, keeping their line and not breaking\r\nforward into the enemy’s ranks; it was more like bayonet drill than a\r\ncharge. I do not think that more than a dozen men fell on either side.\r\nAfter a minute the English captain saw that the French supports were\r\nclosing in--he shouted ‘right about face’, and his men trotted back.\r\nWhen our front was clear of them, our five (four)[868] companies opened\r\nfire by platoons, and as the distance was only 100 yards we saw heaps\r\nof the French fall at each volley[869].’ Tovey’s company lost 11 killed\r\nand 14 wounded out of about 75 present in this extraordinary adventure,\r\nwhich had given the three rear companies and the Brunswickers time to\r\nform up across the crest and in the bushes on each side of it. It is\r\nastonishing that a man of the 8th Company got away--clearly the enemy\r\nhad been too much astonished to pursue as he might have done[870].\r\n\r\nThe fight on the path that leads to the Linduz now became a very\r\nconfused and constricted business, with many casualties on both sides,\r\nsince French and English were firing at each other along a sort of\r\navenue and could hardly miss. Foy’s second battalion, the 1/69th, had\r\nnow reinforced his first, and finally the left wing of the 20th, badly\r\nthinned, gave way and fell back in some disorder to the point where\r\nthe crest-path debouches on to the Linduz plateau. Here all was ready\r\nfor defence--the right wing of the 20th, with the regimental colours\r\nflying, was waiting ready for the enemy, with the 1/7th in immediate\r\nsupport and the 1/23rd in reserve. When the narrow-fronted French\r\ncolumn tried to burst out of the defile, officers in front, drums\r\nbeating the _pas de charge_, a long-reserved volley smote it, and all\r\nthe leading files went down. There was a pause before the third of\r\nFoy’s battalions, the 2/69th, got to the front and tried a similar\r\nattack, which failed with even greater loss. For the whole of the rest\r\nof the afternoon spasmodic fighting went on at the Linduz. ‘The enemy\r\nwas visible,’ writes one of Ross’s brigade, ‘several thousands strong,\r\non the higher part of the spur; every half-hour or so he sent another\r\ncompany down to relieve his skirmishers. He always came up in detail\r\nand slowly, for there was a tiresome defile to cross, over a deep\r\ncutting in the crest[871], where only one man abreast could pass. We\r\ncould always let the head of the attack debouch, and then attack it and\r\nthrow it back upon its supports[872].’ No attempt was made to turn the\r\nLinduz by its eastern side, among the steep slopes and thickets at the\r\nhead of Val Carlos: all attacks came straight along the spur. Reille\r\nattributes this in his dispatch to the dreadful delays at the rear of\r\nhis long column, owing to the narrowness of the path. He acknowledges\r\nthat an attempt should have been made to push on to the Ibaneta, but\r\nit was 3.30 before Maucune’s first battalion began to arrive to Foy’s\r\nassistance, and 5 before the rear of his division was up. ‘By this hour\r\nit was too late to think of turning movements’--even if the fog which\r\nstopped Clausel had not swept down on the Linduz also. As a matter of\r\nfact only Foy’s four front regiments--five battalions--were put into\r\nthe fight[873]. Similarly on the British side the fight was sustained\r\nonly by the 20th, relieved, after its cartridges were all spent, by the\r\n7th and the 23rd.\r\n\r\nReille does not omit to mention that after the first hour of fight was\r\nover, Cole had begun to show reserves on the Linduz which would have\r\nmade any attack by Foy’s division, unsupported, quite hopeless. It\r\nwill be remembered that the commander of the 4th Division had started\r\nAnson’s brigade for Orbaiceta, and Stubbs’s brigade for the Ibaneta\r\nridge, when first the attack on Byng was reported, and he had gone to\r\nthe Altobiscar himself to watch the progress of affairs on that side.\r\nWhile he was there Foy’s attack on the Linduz developed: Cole at once\r\nrode to the left, to see how Ross was faring, and in consequence sent\r\ndownhill to bid Anson abandon his long march to the extreme right,\r\nand to turn up the Roncesvalles pass, as Stubbs did also. The British\r\nbrigade took post on Ross’s right; the Portuguese brigade on the\r\nIbaneta, watching the steep path from the Val Carlos. Up this there\r\npresently came the 1/57th and the Spanish battalions which had been\r\nnear them. Thus Cole showed a continuous line from the Altobiscar to\r\nthe Linduz, held by 11,000 men placed in a most formidable position not\r\nmore than three miles long. Nor was this all--General Campbell in the\r\nAlduides, after scattering the National Guards who had tried to delude\r\nhim in the early morning, had heard the firing at Roncesvalles, and\r\n(though he had no orders) thought it his duty to march with his five\r\nPortuguese battalions toward the sound of battle. Taking the highland\r\ntrack along the upper end of the Alduides, he appeared on Ross’s left\r\nat 4 o’clock in the afternoon by the so-called path of Atalosti. He was\r\nin a position to outflank any attempts that Reille might make to turn\r\nRoss’s position on the western side.\r\n\r\nWhen the fog fell Soult was in a very unpleasant situation. Having\r\nchosen to attack his enemy with narrow-fronted columns of immense\r\ndepth, over two constricted routes, he had been brought to a complete\r\ncheck. Clausel had driven in Byng’s outpost, but was stuck in front of\r\nthe Altobiscar: Reille had failed to move Ross at all, and was blocked\r\nin front of the Linduz. The losses had been negligible, it is true--not\r\nmuch over 500 in all if the Marshal is to be believed. But those of\r\nthe Allies were still smaller, and the confidence of the men had been\r\nraised by the way in which they had easily blocked for some ten hours,\r\nand with small loss, an army whose vast strength they could estimate\r\nby the interminable file of distant troops crawling up the roads in\r\nthe rear[874]. If the men, however, were cheerful, their commander\r\nwas not. Cole estimated the French at 30,000 men and more, and quite\r\ncorrectly: he had himself only 11,000 in line, with 2,000 more of\r\nCampbell’s Portuguese in touch on his left. Picton’s 3rd Division,\r\nwhich lay at Olague on the morn of the 25th, had no doubt started to\r\nclose up; but it was a long day’s march away, and could not be at\r\nAltobiscar or on the Linduz till the 26th. Anything might be happening\r\nin the fog which lay deep on the mountains all night. Cole determined\r\n‘that he could not hope to maintain the passes against the very great\r\nsuperiority of the force opposed to him--amounting to from 30,000 to\r\n35,000 men[875]’, and that he must retire by night under cover of\r\nthe mist. Even if his views had been less pessimistic, he would yet\r\nhave been compelled to retreat by the action of Byng, who had fought\r\nheroically all the day, but was obsessed by fears as the fog settled\r\ndown. He had come to the conclusion that, as the enemy had possession\r\nof the path along the eastern hills to Orbaiceta, and had superabundant\r\nnumbers, he would be using the night to send a large force in that\r\ndirection, where only the Spanish regiment of Leon was on guard. They\r\ncould not be stopped, and when down in the valley of the Irati would\r\nbe able to take Roncesvalles from the rear, and to throw the whole\r\ndefending force on to the necessity of retiring by the Mendichuri and\r\nAtalosti routes, on which retreat would be slow and dangerous. Byng\r\ntherefore sent a message to Cole that he must needs retire, and was\r\nalready beginning to draw off his troops, under cover of his light\r\ncompanies, when he received Cole’s orders to the same effect. The moral\r\nresponsibility for the retreat lay equally on both--the technical\r\nresponsibility on Cole alone, as the superior officer: he might, of\r\ncourse, have ordered Byng back to his old position, which the French\r\nhad left quite unmolested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Combat of RONCESVALLES July 25th 1813]\r\n\r\nWas Cole’s pessimism justified? Wellington thought not: he wrote to\r\nLord Liverpool ten days later, ‘Sir Lowry Cole, whose retreat\r\noccasioned the retreat of the whole, retired, not because he could\r\nnot hold his position, but because his right flank was turned. It is\r\na great disadvantage when the officer commanding in chief is absent.\r\nFor this reason there is nothing that I dislike so much as these\r\nextended operations, which I cannot direct myself[876].’ And he was\r\nno doubt thinking of Cole, no less than of Picton, when he wrote that\r\n‘all the beatings we have given the French have not given our generals\r\nconfidence in themselves and in the exertions of their troops. They\r\nare really heroes when I am on the spot to direct them, but when I\r\nam obliged to quit them they are children.’ Cole was an officer of\r\nthe first merit in handling troops, as he was to show at Sorauren\r\ntwo days later; and that he was not destitute of initiative had been\r\nsufficiently proved by the advance of the 4th Division at Albuera,\r\nwhere he was practically acting without orders[877]. But there seems\r\nno doubt that the scale of the operations in the Pyrenees made him\r\nnervous: he was responsible on the 25th July not for a division but\r\nfor a small army, and he was well aware of the enemy’s superiority in\r\nnumbers. His conduct was the more surprising because he had received\r\nbefore 10 o’clock Wellington’s stringent dispatch of the night of the\r\n24th, telling him to ‘maintain the passes in front of Roncesvalles to\r\nthe utmost,’ and to disregard any wide turning movements to the east on\r\nSoult’s part. These orders reached him at the Leiçaratheca, just as he\r\nwas witnessing Byng’s successful repulse of Barbot’s brigade. Possibly\r\nthe excitement of the moment prevented him from thoroughly appreciating\r\ntheir full meaning, and for the rest of the day he was busy enough,\r\nriding from front to front on the passes. As he wrote in his first\r\nshort account of his doings, ‘having had no sleep for two nights, and\r\nhaving been on horseback from 4 a.m. till 11 at night, I am somewhat\r\nfagged[878].’ It is, of course, quite unfair to criticize a responsible\r\nofficer in the light of subsequent events; but as a matter of fact\r\nCole was in no danger--the fog endured all that night and far into\r\nthe morning of the 26th. The enemy at Orbaiceta was negligible--one\r\nbattalion and a few National Guards: Soult sent no more troops on that\r\nwretched road. And if he had done so, after the fog cleared on the\r\n26th, they would have taken the best part of a day to get into action.\r\nIt seems certain that Cole could have held the passes for another day\r\nwithout any great risk; and if he had done so, Soult’s whole plan of\r\ncampaign would have been wrecked. But, of course, the fog _might_ have\r\nlifted at midnight: Soult _might_ have sent two divisions by a night\r\nmarch to Orbaiceta, and a retreat by bad tracks like the Atalosti\r\nwould have been slow, and also eccentric, since it did not cover the\r\nPampeluna road, but would have taken Cole to Eugui and the Col de\r\nVelate. Nevertheless, looking at the words of Wellington’s dispatch of\r\nthe 24th, it seems that Cole disobeyed orders: he did _not_ hold the\r\npasses to the utmost, and he did not disregard turning movements to the\r\nfar east.\r\n\r\nBoth the Linduz and Altobiscar were evacuated in the early hours of\r\nthe night of July 25th-6th: the French did not discover the move till\r\nmorning, and by dawn the whole of Cole’s force was far on its way down\r\nthe Pampeluna road entirely unmolested, though very weary.\r\n\r\nTo understand the general situation on the morning of July 26th, we\r\nmust now turn back, to note what had been happening in the Bastan\r\nduring the long hours of Byng’s and Ross’s fight in the southern\r\npasses. The supplementary part of Soult’s plan had been to force the\r\nMaya defile, and thus to break in the left-centre of Wellington’s line\r\nof defence, at the same moment that his main body turned its extreme\r\nright flank, by forcing its way through the Roncesvalles gap. D’Erlon’s\r\nthree divisions, for whom this task had been set aside, had no long\r\ndétour to execute, like those of Reille: they were already concentrated\r\nin front of their objective; their leading section was at Urdax, only a\r\nfew miles from the summit of the Maya ridge; their most remote reserves\r\nat Espelette, in the valley of the Nive, were within one day’s march of\r\nthe British positions.\r\n\r\nThe orders issued by Soult to D’Erlon on July 23rd ran as follows:\r\n‘Comte D’Erlon will make his dispositions on the 24th to attack the\r\nenemy at dawn on the 25th, to make himself master of the Puerto of\r\nMaya, and to pursue the enemy when he shall begin his retreat....\r\nIt is to be presumed that the hostile forces in the Bastan, in the\r\nAlduides, and in the passes of Ispegui and Maya will draw back the\r\nmoment that they hear of [Clausel’s and Reille’s] movement, or else\r\nthat they will begin to manœuvre, so as to leave their present\r\npositions ungarrisoned. Comte D’Erlon will seize the moment to attack\r\nthem briskly, and to seize the Maya pass. From thence he will march\r\nby Ariscun on Elizondo, and then on the Col de Velate, or possibly by\r\nBerderis on the pass of Urtiaga, according to the route which the enemy\r\nmay take in his retreat. He should remember that he must try to unite\r\nas soon as possible with the main body in the direction here indicated,\r\nand to get into communication with General Reille. Whatever may happen,\r\nhe must send strong detachments to pursue any hostile columns that may\r\ntry to get off to their left [westward], to discover their routes,\r\nworry them, and pick up prisoners.’\r\n\r\nThese are very curious orders, as all their directions depend on the\r\nidea that Roncesvalles will be forced with ease, and that on hearing of\r\nits being lost all the Allied troops in the centre of Wellington’s line\r\nwill retire in haste. Soult committed himself to this hypothesis in the\r\nwords ‘it is to be presumed that the enemy will defend the position\r\nof Altobiscar feebly, because he will see that he is being outflanked\r\nby Reille’s divisions on the Linduz, and threatened at the same time,\r\non his right flank by the detachment and the National Guards who are\r\ndemonstrating in the direction of Orbaiceta.’ But what if Roncesvalles\r\nwere held for twelve hours against Clausel, if Reille were completely\r\nblocked all day on the Linduz, and if the demonstration on Orbaiceta\r\nproved ineffective? In this case the British troops on the Maya front\r\nwill _not_ hear of disasters in the south, they will _not_ retreat, but\r\nstand to fight; and D’Erlon, far from having a walk over the pass, as\r\na commencement to a rapid pursuit of a flying enemy, will have a hard\r\nday’s work before him.\r\n\r\nThis is what was to happen. D’Erlon, instead of running against an\r\nenemy who was about to retreat, and pushing him forward with ease, met\r\nwith troops determined to hold their position, and found himself let\r\nin for one of the bloodiest battles on a small scale that were fought\r\nduring the whole war. That he was finally successful, though at a\r\nheavy cost, was due to the mistakes made by the British generals in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the troops which formed Wellington’s centre was as\r\nfollows. Hill was in charge of the whole sector, from the Maya Pass\r\nto the head of the Alduides valley. His force consisted of the 2nd\r\nDivision (minus Byng’s brigade, detached to Roncesvalles nearly a month\r\nback), and of Silveira’s Portuguese division. William Stewart held\r\nthe left, with the three available 2nd Division brigades--Cameron’s,\r\nPringle’s, and Ashworth’s Portuguese. The two British brigades were in\r\nor about the Maya Pass, Ashworth was holding the Ispegui Pass, seven\r\nmiles to the east, with one battalion in the defile, and the others in\r\nsupport on the road from Errazu. Silveira’s two brigades continued the\r\nline southward, Da Costa’s watching the Col de Berderis and other minor\r\npasses south of the Ispegui, while A. Campbell’s was in the Alduides,\r\non the slopes above the village of that name. Silveira himself was with\r\nDa Costa. Campbell, as we have already seen, was in close touch with\r\nthe Roncesvalles force, and ultimately joined it.\r\n\r\nOn the other flank the 2nd Division at Maya had as its nearest\r\nneighbour the 7th Division, which was holding the ‘Puerto’ of Echalar.\r\nBehind lay the Light Division by Vera, and the 6th Division, now under\r\nPack, since Clinton’s health had again broken down, in reserve at\r\nSantesteban.\r\n\r\nNow on the early morning of the 25th the first troops stirring were\r\nSoult’s National Guard detachments on the Alduides front, which (as we\r\nhave already seen) attracted the notice of Campbell’s Portuguese, and\r\nsuffered for their temerity. Their activity, most unfortunately, drew\r\nthe attention of Sir Rowland Hill in this direction. He rode out from\r\nhis head-quarters at Elizondo to visit Campbell, when the demonstration\r\nwas reported to him. And he was actually in the Alduides, at the\r\nextreme southern end of his sector, when the French attacked in force\r\nthe Maya passes, at its extreme northern end. This was a pardonable\r\nmishap, since he was on his own business. But it led to his being\r\nabsent from the real point of danger. Quite unpardonable, however, was\r\nthe fact that William Stewart, commanding the 2nd Division, abandoned\r\nhis own troops and went out to join Hill in the same direction[879],\r\ntoward the front of Silveira’s brigades, attracted by the news of\r\nfighting at early dawn. He would seem to have left no note of his\r\nprobable whereabouts at Maya, so that he was sought in vain for many\r\nhours, when his troops were attacked. In his absence the command of his\r\ndivision fell to General Pringle, who had arrived from England only\r\ntwo days before, to take over the brigade of which Colonel O’Callaghan\r\nof the 39th had been in temporary charge since the opening of the\r\ncampaign. Pringle knew neither the troops nor the ground, and being\r\nonly a brigadier had no authority to make new dispositions, when his\r\ncommanding officer was still technically present, though invisible for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nThe whole responsibility for what happened on the morning of the 25th,\r\ntherefore, fell on Stewart. And he must also be given the discredit of\r\nthe very inadequate arrangements that had been made for the defence\r\nof the pass. The French at Urdax were only four miles from the crest,\r\nand it was known that they were in strength close behind--their\r\nlarge camps about Ainhoue, where Abbé’s division was cantoned, were\r\nperfectly visible from the heights[880], and obviously crammed with\r\nmen. Considering that he was in close touch with the enemy, Stewart’s\r\nprecautions were ludicrously incomplete. The Maya position consists\r\nof a broad open grassy saddle, between the high mountains to east\r\nand west--the Alcorrunz peak on the left and the Aretesque peak on\r\nthe right. The saddle at its lowest point is about 2,000 ft. above\r\nsea-level--the flanking heights run up to a thousand feet more. The\r\nhigh road from Urdax and Zagaramurdi climbs the saddle in its middle,\r\nruns westward along its summit for a mile, and then descends by a broad\r\ncurve towards Elizondo on the Spanish side. There is another lesser\r\ntrack which leads up on to the saddle, from Espelette; it gets on to\r\nthe level of the Col at its extreme eastern end, under the Aretesque\r\nheight; thence, after running along the crest for a mile, it meets the\r\nhigh road, crosses it, and continues along the slopes of the Alcorrunz\r\npeak, and ultimately falls into the by-road from Santesteban to\r\nZagaramurdi. This path, useful for lateral communications east and\r\nwest, is still known as the _Chemin des Anglais_, from the work which\r\nwas spent upon it by Wellington’s army later in the year, when the\r\nnecessity for good tracks along the front was better understood than\r\nit seems to have been in July. In contemporary records it is generally\r\ncalled the Gorospil path.\r\n\r\nThe west end of the saddle was not inadequately guarded by Cameron’s\r\nbrigade, which was encamped by battalions on each side of the main\r\n_chaussée_ close behind the crest, with four Portuguese guns, of Da\r\nCunha’s battery, mounted on a commanding knoll whence they could\r\nsweep the road. But the east end of the position, under the hill\r\nof Aretesque, where the minor road comes in, was almost entirely\r\nneglected. There was only a picquet of 80 men placed to cover it,\r\non the spot where the _Chemin des Anglais_ gets to the crest of the\r\nposition. Pringle’s brigade, which supplied this picquet, was two and a\r\nhalf miles to the rear, in the low ground about the village of Maya--an\r\nhour’s march away, for the ascent to the picquet was a climb uphill\r\nby a bad path. The only support immediately available for the outpost\r\nwas the four light companies of the brigade[881], which were encamped\r\non the back-slope of the ridge, about half-way between the hill of\r\nAretesque and the main body of the brigade.\r\n\r\nThere was much dead ground in front of the Maya position, where it\r\nmight be approached by ravines and combes whose bottom could not be\r\nfathomed by the eye. And in particular the view north-eastward, towards\r\nEspelette, was completely blocked by a high round hill half a mile\r\nbeyond the outer sentries of the Aretesque picquet. With the French\r\nonly four miles away at Urdax, and seven at Espelette, it is clear that\r\nprudence would have dictated constant reconnaissance of all the dead\r\nground. Stewart had made no such arrangements--all that we hear is that\r\nthe round hill beyond the Aretesque picquet was occasionally visited by\r\nPortuguese vedettes. Apparently none had gone out on the morning of the\r\n25th.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon would appear to have been well acquainted with the general\r\ndisposition of the British line, as he launched his main attack against\r\nthe under-manned eastern flank of the position, and did not tackle the\r\nstrongly held ground on the high road, at its western end, until he was\r\nwell established on the crest. Darmagnac’s division, from Espelette,\r\nled the main column, Abbé’s division from Ainhoue fell into its rear\r\nand followed: both took the _Chemin des Anglais_ track, which was\r\nblocked from the view of the British picquets by the round hill already\r\nmentioned. Maransin’s division at Urdax, on the high road, was ordered\r\nto mass itself, but to keep under cover, and show no signs of movement\r\ntill the main body had reached and occupied the eastern end of the\r\nsaddle. It was then to assail Cameron’s brigade, advancing up the high\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThough the morning was bright and clear, no certain signs of a French\r\nattack were seen till 10 o’clock, so carefully did the enemy utilize\r\nthe ‘dead ground’ in front of him. Suspicious movements indeed were\r\nobserved by the outpost of the 71st on the high road, who noted small\r\nbodies of men crossing the sky-line in front of Urdax[882]. And the\r\npicquet of the 34th on the Aretesque hill reported to Pringle’s\r\nbrigade-head-quarters that it had seen a small body of cavalry and\r\na larger force of infantry turn the corner of a distant road beyond\r\nAinhoue and disappear again[883]. On both points the enemy had only\r\nbeen visible for a few minutes. Pringle sent up a staff-officer[884]\r\nto the Aretesque picquet, who made nothing of the troops that had been\r\ndetected on that side, but as a measure of precaution ordered up the\r\nfour light companies of the brigade to join the picquet on the crest.\r\nThus there chanced to be 400 men instead of 80, when D’Erlon discovered\r\nhimself an hour later. But the five companies were as powerless a guard\r\nagainst the sudden attack of 7,000 men as the one company would have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nAt 10.30 D’Erlon had reached the point, not much over half a mile from\r\nthe most advanced British sentry, where the head of his column would\r\nbe forced to come out into the open and show itself. His dispositions\r\naimed at a sudden surprise--and effected it. He collected the eight\r\nlight companies of Darmagnac’s division, ordered them to take off and\r\nstack their knapsacks, and launched them as a swarm of _tirailleurs_\r\nat the position of the British on the Aretesque knoll (or the Gorospil\r\nknoll, as Darmagnac calls it in his report). The 16th Léger followed\r\nthem in column, keeping to the track, while the skirmishers spread out\r\nin a semicircle to envelop the knoll. The remainder of the division\r\ncame on as quickly as it could in support.\r\n\r\nThe French attacked at a pace that surprised their enemies; the light\r\ncompanies--they were commanded by Bradbey of the 28th--were desperately\r\nengaged within ten minutes of the firing of the first shot. Their\r\nflanks being turned, they clubbed together on the higher slopes of the\r\nknoll, and around some rocky outcrops on its summit, and held their\r\nown for three-quarters of an hour, repulsing several attacks of the\r\nvoltigeurs and the 16th Léger with great loss, and suffering heavily\r\nthemselves. Meanwhile the attention of the defenders of the pass being\r\nthus distracted, the succeeding battalions of Darmagnac’s division\r\nhurried up unmolested one after another on to the saddle, and began to\r\ndeploy. Their general threw the 8th Line across the rear of the knoll,\r\nblocking the path which led down to the village of Maya and the camps\r\nof Pringle’s brigade, and drew out in succession the 28th, 51st, and\r\n54th on the plateau to their right.\r\n\r\nBefore any succour could arrive[885] the five unlucky companies on the\r\nGorospil knoll were crushed by the concentric attack--six unwounded\r\nofficers and 140 men were taken prisoners among the rocks at the\r\nsummit--the other 260 were nearly all killed or wounded. Soon after\r\nthey had succumbed, tardy reinforcements began to arrive--Pringle had\r\nstarted off his three battalions from the valley to climb the path\r\nup to the crest--they arrived at intervals, for their camps were at\r\nvarying distances from the point of danger, and each acted for itself.\r\nThe Brigadier himself, finding that he was in general command, appears\r\nto have ridden up the high road and joined Cameron’s brigade at the\r\nMaya end of the saddle. From thence he began to send off detachments\r\nof that brigade, to co-operate from the flank with the uphill frontal\r\nattack which his own battalions were about to make from the valley.\r\n\r\nHe found Cameron’s brigade under arms, in good order, and unmolested.\r\nThe Portuguese guns had begun to fire, but not at any enemy, for\r\nMaransin was holding back, according to his orders. The shots were\r\nsignals to give notice to the 7th Division, Ashworth, and other\r\noutlying neighbours, that serious fighting had opened in the passes.\r\nThey do not seem to have commenced till 11 o’clock or even later, for\r\nWellington had ridden off from Lesaca towards St. Sebastian before\r\nthe cannonade began; and we know that when he started about 11 a.m.\r\nno gunfire from the east had been reported. Cameron had already sent\r\noff the 50th, the right-hand corps of his brigade, to push along the\r\nwatershed of the col, and stop the French from any further progress\r\ntoward the high road. This left only the 71st and 92nd under the\r\nRock of Maya, on the culminating point of the position, awaiting the\r\napproach of Maransin, which obviously would not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nThe second episode of the fight consisted in a series of desperate but\r\nill-connected attempts by four British battalions--the 28th, 34th,\r\n39th, 50th--to push Darmagnac’s eight battalions off the foothold\r\non the east end of the col, where they were now firmly established.\r\nAbbé’s division was not yet on the ground, but was already visible\r\nfiling up the track which Darmagnac’s had already traversed. The three\r\nBritish battalions from the valley arrived in succession, and attacked\r\nfrontally the mass of French on the crest above them. The 34th came up\r\nfirst and alone. ‘It was death to go on against such a host, but it\r\nwas the _order_, and we went on to destruction, marching up a narrow\r\npath with men pumped out and breathless. We had no chance. The colonel,\r\nalways a good mark, being mounted and foremost, was first knocked over,\r\nvery badly wounded. Seven more officers were wounded. We persevered,\r\npushed on, made a footing, and kept our ground[886].’ But the French\r\nheld the crest above, and the 34th was brought to a complete\r\nstandstill. The 39th then climbed up the slope, more to the west, and\r\nmade a similar unsuccessful push to reach the sky-line. Meanwhile the\r\n50th, coming from the other side along the crest, attacked the French\r\nright, and drove in the leading battalion on to the mass, but could\r\nget no farther forward, and finally fell back. The last episode of\r\nthis struggle was a third isolated attack--Pringle had told Cameron to\r\ndetach the right wing of the 92nd from the Maya position, and to send\r\nit on in support of the 50th. Just as the latter recoiled, this strong\r\nhalf-battalion--nearly 400 muskets--came on to the ground on the crest,\r\nand at the same moment the 28th, the last of Pringle’s battalions to\r\narrive from the valley, climbed the slope and came up diagonally on\r\nthe right of the 92nd companies. Pringle himself aligned the two corps\r\nand led them against the solid mass of French. This advance ended in a\r\nmost desperate fire-duel at a range of 120 yards, in which the French\r\nhad the more casualties, but the British line was in the end shot to\r\npieces. Observers from the 28th and 34th speak in the most moving terms\r\nof the extraordinary steadiness of the 92nd. ‘They stood there like a\r\nstone wall, overmatched by twenty to one, until half their blue bonnets\r\nlay beside those brave highland soldiers. When they retired their dead\r\nbodies lay as a barrier to the advancing foe. O but they did fight well\r\nthat day! I can see the line now of their dead and wounded stretched\r\nupon the heather, as the living kept closing up to the centre[887].’\r\nIt was only when sixty per cent. of these stubborn soldiers had fallen\r\nthat the senior of the two surviving officers with the wing ordered the\r\nremnant to fall back on the 50th, who had re-formed in their rear. The\r\n28th, who had been engaged (oddly enough!) with the French 28th, across\r\na dip on the south side of the crest, were cut off from the 92nd, and\r\nretreated downhill by the way they had come, towards the village of\r\nMaya. So did the 34th, which had been rallied some way down the slope,\r\nbelow the point where they had made their unsuccessful attack, and had\r\nbeen taking long shots uphill against the French flank. So also did\r\nthe 39th, or the greater part of it[888]. The progress of these spent\r\ntroops downhill was hastened by D’Erlon’s detaching two battalions to\r\npush them away. They lapsed out of the battle, and retreated towards\r\nMaya village, leaving Cameron’s brigade alone to maintain the struggle\r\nupon the crest--three battalions against three divisions, for Abbé’s\r\nmen were now deploying behind Darmagnac’s, and Maransin’s long-deferred\r\nattack was just beginning to develop.\r\n\r\nAfter the wasted remnant of the right wing of the 92nd had recoiled,\r\nthe French began to advance along the _Chemin des Anglais_, pushing\r\nthe beaten troops before them, but were soon brought to a stand for\r\na few minutes once more. For Cameron had detached the right wing of\r\nthe 71st from the Maya position to follow up the right wing of the\r\n92nd--the system of dribbling in small reinforcements was practised\r\nall day--leaving only the two left wings of those regiments to hold\r\nthe pass against Maransin, who was still an impending danger only. The\r\nnewly arrived half-battalion, drawn up across the path, delivered a\r\nvery telling salvo against the front immediately opposed to them--the\r\nenemy was now in a mixed mass with no trace of formation, acting like\r\na dense swarm of _tirailleurs_--and brought it to a stop for a moment.\r\nBut the French, holding back in the centre, spread out on the wings,\r\nand began to envelop both flanks of the 71st companies, who had to\r\nretire perforce--losing heavily, though not as the 92nd had suffered\r\nhalf an hour before.[889]\r\n\r\nThere was now no chance whatever of checking D’Erlon, since the only\r\nBritish troops not yet engaged, the left wings of the 71st and 92nd,\r\nwere at last feeling the commencement of Maransin’s attack, and there\r\nwere no reinforcements yet visible. Just at this moment, it was perhaps\r\n2 p.m.[890], the long-lost William Stewart at last appeared upon the\r\nscene and assumed command. The noise of the guns had reached him in\r\nthe distant Alduides, and drawn him back to his own business, which he\r\nfound in a most deplorable condition. A glance round the field showed\r\nhim that he must give up any hope of holding the Maya pass, and that\r\nhis only chance was to fight a detaining battle across the high road,\r\nin the hope of receiving help from the 7th Division, to whom Pringle\r\nhad already sent urgent demands for succour.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly issued orders for the two intact half-battalions on the\r\ncrest to fall back, and take up a new position below it; while the\r\nweary troops from the old front took shelter and re-formed behind them.\r\nDarmagnac’s regiments were as much fought out as their opponents, and\r\ndid not press. Maransin, who had brought up his troops in two columns,\r\none on the road, the other up a ravine to his right, on seeing the way\r\nleft open to him, did not hurry on, but began to deploy his battalions\r\nin succession as they filed up to the saddle of the col. Hence there\r\nwas a distinct break in the action--half an hour or even more. No\r\ndisaster was suffered by Cameron’s brigade--the only unfortunate\r\nincident of the moment of recoil being that the four Portuguese guns\r\nwere lost. Two had been man-handled with much toil up a rocky slope,\r\nfrom which it was impossible to get them down in a hurry. After firing\r\na round or two of case at the enemy’s approaching skirmishers, their\r\ngunners pushed them over into a ravine and made off[891]. The other\r\ntwo were taken while on the move. Wellington attributed the loss of\r\nthese four guns, which he much resented (for his army never lost\r\nanother field gun in action during the whole war), to Stewart, who had,\r\non his arrival, countermanded an order of Pringle’s which had directed\r\nan earlier retreat for them.\r\n\r\nThe fourth episode of the combat of Maya, though it included much\r\nbloody and obstinate fighting, was not such a desperate business as\r\nthe long scrambling fight along the _Chemin des Anglais_. D’Erlon\r\nhalted Darmagnac’s troops, who naturally had to re-form, for they were\r\nin complete disorder, and had suffered most severely. He now used\r\nMaransin’s division as his striking force, and when he had got it all\r\ndeployed attacked Stewart’s new position. Abbé’s division was brought\r\nup to act in support. It was probably well past 3 o’clock when the new\r\nfighting began: the delay had enabled Stewart to rearrange a fighting\r\nline--the left wings of the 71st and 92nd were drawn up on each side\r\nof the _chaussée_, flanked on their left by a company of the latter\r\nregiment on a precipitous knoll, where Cameron had placed them before\r\nthe action began. This company was afterwards reinforced by another\r\nfrom the 82nd, when that regiment came up[892]. About three hundred\r\nyards behind, the right wing of the 71st and the 50th, now rallied,\r\nmade a second line. When Maransin developed his attack, the front line\r\ndelivered its fire, and fell back in an orderly fashion behind the\r\nsupports, where it re-formed across the road. The second line repeated\r\nthis manœuvre. The half-mile of ground given up in these alternate\r\nretreats included the camping lines of the 71st and 92nd, where the\r\nrows of tents not only broke the enemy’s formation, but tempted\r\nindividuals aside for loot. ‘They were plundering on all hands,\r\ncutting down the tents, strewing about the officers’ linen, and tearing\r\nopen their portmanteaux, many of which contained a company’s month’s\r\npay, while we were obliged to stand at a distance, and view the work of\r\ndestruction[893].’\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was drawing on--it was 4.30 or later before Maransin’s\r\nline re-formed and again advanced: Stewart’s front line again retired,\r\nbut when the enemy followed it he was surprised to be met by a\r\ncounter-attack. Stewart had just received his first reinforcements--a\r\nweak battalion of the 82nd, the nearest troops of the 7th Division,\r\nwhich had long been watching the fight from afar on the Alcorrunz\r\npeak, and had just received their divisional general’s permission to\r\ncome in. These new-comers, joining the reserve line, met the leading\r\nFrench battalions with a brisk offensive, which drove them in on their\r\nsupports. But numbers prevailed, and the fight began once more to roll\r\ndownhill. At this moment affairs looked black--Stewart had just been\r\nwounded in the leg, but still retained the command--he was a splendid\r\nfighting man if a careless and tiresome subordinate. Thinking the\r\nposition hopeless, and a final retreat necessary, he sent messages\r\nto the outlying companies of the 82nd and 92nd on the knoll to the\r\nleft, who were now quite cut off from the rest of the force, to save\r\nthemselves by striking across the hills. They had been isolated for two\r\nhours, had used up all their cartridges, and were defending themselves\r\nby the primitive method of pelting the enemy below with whinstones,\r\nwhich lay thick on the hillside[894].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMBAT OF MAYA 25 July 1813]\r\n\r\nBut before the messenger, who had to take a vast détour, could reach\r\nthis desperate little party, the last episode of the combat of Maya\r\nhad begun. It was a sufficiently surprising end to the day. At about\r\n6 o’clock there arrived, marching hard along the mountain road which\r\ncontinues the _Chemin des Anglais_ westward, two battalions under\r\nGeneral Barnes from the 2nd Brigade of the 7th Division[895], which\r\nLord Dalhousie had sent from Echalar on getting the appeal for help.\r\nThese two units--the 1/6th and Brunswick-Oels--were only 1,500\r\nbayonets, and had done nine miles at a hot pace. But they were\r\nfresh troops, and led by a very thunderbolt of war--Barnes was the\r\nbrigadier who a few days later made what Wellington declared to be\r\nthe most gallant charge that he had seen, a charge that drew notes of\r\nadmiration from the most reticent of pens[896]. They came in diagonally\r\nfrom an unexpected side road, unseen by the enemy till the moment of\r\ncontact, and crashed in upon the leading French battalion with such an\r\nimpetus that it was trampled down--losing 15 officers in a minute. The\r\nwhole of the rest of the British troops present cheered, and advanced\r\nin the wake of Barnes’s men--even the poor wreck of the right wing\r\nof the 92nd, headed by its one surviving piper. A counter-attack on\r\ntroops who have already done much, and are taken by surprise in what\r\nseems the moment of success, is often astoundingly effective--as the\r\nwar of 1914-18 has showed. In this case the result was surprising:\r\nMaransin’s leading brigade fell back in disorder on his supports, the\r\nlatter gave way also, and the whole mass retired uphill, as far as the\r\ncamping-ground of Cameron’s regiments at the head of the pass. D’Erlon,\r\nwrongly believing that the whole 7th Division had arrived _en masse_,\r\nthrew a brigade of Abbé’s division across the crest of the col, behind\r\nwhich the beaten troops took shelter. He expected to end the day with\r\na defensive action, and even recalled a brigade of Darmagnac’s troops,\r\nwho had been sent down towards the village of Maya, in pursuit of\r\nPringle’s brigade, and who had just got engaged near it with Ashworth’s\r\nPortuguese, then retiring by order from the pass of Ispegui.\r\n\r\nBut Stewart would have been mad to press on with six battalions--three\r\nof them mere remnants--against eighteen, and halted on the summit,\r\ncontent to have blocked the pass, though the enemy had possession\r\nof it, and of ground in front of it on which he stood deployed. The\r\nfiring continued for a time, and then died down as the dusk came on.\r\nBy 8 o’clock all was over--if D’Erlon had frankly put in Abbé’s strong\r\ndivision of ten battalions, it is clear that he might yet have turned\r\nthe fortune of the day. But he did not: hypnotized by the idea that he\r\nhad the whole of the 2nd and 7th Divisions in front of him, instead\r\nof a mere fragment of each. The battle was well over when General Hill\r\narrived from the Alduides, bringing with him unlucky news--he had\r\nintercepted and read, at Elizondo, Cole’s dispatch to Head-quarters\r\nsaying that he had been attacked at Roncesvalles by 35,000 men, and\r\nthat he was giving up the pass. Wherefore Hill resolved that he also\r\nmust retire, and ordered the weary troops of Stewart and Barnes to\r\nretreat after midnight to Elizondo and cross the upper Bidassoa. It\r\nis scarcely credible that the men who had fought for ten hours under\r\nsuch conditions on such rough ground, retained strength to move another\r\nfurlong--but the order was obeyed, though many badly wounded men had\r\nto be abandoned, and though the _chaussée_ was strewn for miles by\r\ndead-beat stragglers, who dropped out and slept till daylight. They\r\nwere not disturbed--for D’Erlon made no move till the sun was well\r\nup--he had won the pass and was expecting to have to fight again at\r\ndawn, for the right to emerge from it.\r\n\r\nThe losses in a fight so honourable to the British battalions, if so\r\ndiscreditable to British generalship, had been immense in Cameron’s\r\nbrigade, heavy in Pringle’s, appreciable among Barnes’s men, who only\r\nstruck in at the eleventh hour. The first-named had lost 800 men out of\r\n1,900 present, of whom 343 belonged to the gallant and unlucky 1/92nd.\r\nPringle’s three battalions had 530 casualties out of 2,000 present,\r\nincluding 140 unwounded prisoners taken on the Gorospil knoll from its\r\nlight companies. Barnes and the 7th Division troops had won a glorious\r\nsuccess with a loss of only 140 men. The total list gives just under\r\n1,500 casualties out of 6,000 men engaged--of whom 349 were prisoners\r\n(200 of them wounded). These are very different figures from the\r\n3,500 total at which D’Erlon stated Stewart’s loss--but sufficiently\r\ndistressing. The enemy had suffered still more, but from infinitely\r\ngreater numbers--their commander reported 1,400 casualties in\r\nDarmagnac’s division out of 7,000 present, 600 in Maransin’s. Abbé was\r\nbarely engaged at the eleventh hour: one of his brigadiers (Rignoux)\r\nwas hit and only four other officers, with perhaps 100 men. The total\r\nreported is therefore about 2,100--no very formidable proportion out\r\nof 20,000 men present. But some battalions had been badly cut up--the\r\n103rd of Maransin’s division, which bore the first fury of Barnes’s\r\nattack, had 15 officers killed and wounded out of 20 present; and the\r\n28th of Darmagnac’s division lost a similar number in sustaining the\r\nattack of the right wing of the 1/92nd and the British 28th. But this\r\nwas a two-battalion regiment with 40 officers present. Nevertheless,\r\nD’Erlon’s report to Soult sings victory in very modest terms--he has\r\ncaptured the enemy’s position and holds it at the end of the day--the\r\naffair had been one of the most desperate that he has ever seen--the\r\nenemy’s loss has been far greater than his own--but there is no blowing\r\nof trumpets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII: CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSORAUREN. JULY 26-28\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first day’s fighting in the Pyrenean passes could not be called\r\nsatisfactory either to Wellington or to Soult. The former had lost\r\nboth the defiles in which he had intended to make his first stand,\r\nand had lost them in a very tiresome fashion--he thought that Maya\r\nmight have been held at least for twenty-four hours, if there had\r\nbeen a divisional general on the spot to direct the defence: while\r\nRoncesvalles had not been forced, but abandoned by Cole, who could\r\ncertainly have made a longer resistance, if only the orders sent to him\r\nhad been obeyed. It was, above all things, necessary to gain time for\r\nthe concentration of the army, and a precious day had been lost--and\r\nneed not have been lost.\r\n\r\nBut Soult can have been no better pleased: time, to him also, meant\r\neverything; and the orders which he had issued to his lieutenants had\r\npresupposed an easy triumph by surprise in the early morning, with a\r\nforward march in the afternoon. Instead of this he had won by nightfall\r\na bare foothold on the summit of each pass, after much fighting of an\r\nunsatisfactory sort. He, too, had lost a day; and it was only on the\r\nmorrow that he discovered that both at Maya and at Roncesvalles the\r\nenemy had slipped away in the dark, leaving to him the power to debouch\r\nfrom the defiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF SORAUREN\r\n\r\nJuly 28th 1813 Showing the General Situation at 1.15 PM.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Marshal sent on the morning of the 26th a very\r\nflamboyant message of victory to his master the Emperor, who then lay\r\nat Mayence. Both Maya and Roncesvalles had been forced, D’Erlon had\r\ncaptured five guns and many hundreds of prisoners at the former pass:\r\nhe himself hoped to be at Pampeluna, and to have raised its siege, by\r\nthe 27th. These news were sent on from Bayonne by semaphore to Paris\r\nand the Rhine, and reached Napoleon on August 1st. At the same time,\r\nand by the same rapid method of transmission, arrived General Rey’s\r\nreport of his successful repulse of the assault of July 25th. It\r\nis worth while to turn away from solid history for a moment, in order\r\nto see how the Imperial editor of the _Moniteur_ utilized this useful\r\nmaterial for propaganda. He first wrote to Clarke the Minister of\r\nWar: ‘We can now give the public some account of affairs in Spain.\r\nThe Vittoria business and the King must not be mentioned. The first\r\nnote which you must put in the _Moniteur_ should run as follows--“His\r\nMajesty has named the Duke of Dalmatia as his lieutenant-general\r\ncommanding his armies in Spain. The Marshal took up the command on July\r\n12, and made immediate dispositions for marching against the besiegers\r\nof Pampeluna and St. Sebastian.” After that put in General Rey’s first\r\nletter about the events of the 25th-27th. You had better make some\r\nsmall additions to the number of prisoners and of guns captured, not\r\nfor French consumption but to influence European opinion. As I am\r\nprinting General Rey’s dispatch in the _Frankfort Journal_, and have\r\nmade some changes of this sort in it, I send you a corrected copy so\r\nthat it may appear in the _Moniteur_ in identical terms.’\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s second letter to his Foreign Minister, the Duke of\r\nBassano, sent from Dresden three days later, is even more amusing. ‘You\r\nhad better circulate the news that in consequence of Marshal Soult’s\r\nvictory over the English on July 25, the siege of St. Sebastian has\r\nbeen raised, and 30 siege-guns and 200 waggons taken. The blockade of\r\nPampeluna was raised on the 27th: General Hill, who was in command at\r\nthat siege, could not carry off his wounded, and was obliged to burn\r\npart of his baggage. Twelve siege-guns (24-pounders) were captured\r\nthere. Send this to Prague, Leipzig, and Frankfort[897].’\r\n\r\nThis ‘intelligent anticipation of the future,’ for utilization in the\r\narmistice-negotiations going on with Austria, could not have been\r\nbettered. Unfortunately there arrived next day another semaphore\r\nmessage from Soult of the night of the 26th-27th. The Emperor has to\r\nwarn Caulaincourt that yesterday’s propaganda will not stand criticism.\r\n‘I have just got another “telegraphic dispatch” sent on by the Empress\r\nfrom Mayence, giving another communication from Soult, written 24 hours\r\nafter the last, in which he said he would be at Pampeluna on the 27th.\r\nThe enemy lost many men and seven guns. But nothing decisive seems to\r\nhave happened. I am impatient for more news, in order to be able to\r\nunderstand in detail Soult’s dispositions, and to form from them a\r\ngeneral idea of the situation[898].’\r\n\r\nAlas for human ingenuity! Soult’s next dispatch, of July 29, was not to\r\nbe of the sort that craved for publicity in the _Moniteur_, even with\r\nthe most judicious editing.\r\n\r\nBut to return from Dresden to Biscay, and from the head-quarters of the\r\nEmperor to those of the ‘Sepoy General’ whom he had at last begun to\r\nrecognize as capable of ‘des projets très sensés.’\r\n\r\nIf only Wellington had been at his head-quarters at Lesaca at 11\r\no’clock on the morning of July 25th, and if William Stewart had been\r\non the spot at Maya, and had sent early news of D’Erlon’s attack,\r\nmany things might have happened differently. Wellington would have\r\nhad a long afternoon before him to concert operations, and would\r\nhave possessed information to guide him in drawing up his scheme.\r\nUnfortunately he was absent--as we have seen--and only received at\r\n6 o’clock a second-hand report from Lord Dalhousie at Echalar, to\r\nthe effect that fighting was going on at Maya, with the unfortunate\r\naddition that D’Erlon had been repulsed--a most inaccurate summary\r\nof what had happened. Later on in the evening, not before 10 p.m.,\r\ncame Cole’s first dispatch from Roncesvalles, to say that he and Byng\r\nwere heavily engaged at 1 o’clock with a large French force, and\r\nwere holding their own. On these scanty data Wellington felt that no\r\nconclusions could be drawn--he wrote to Graham that there must be a\r\ngreat mass of French troops not yet discovered, which would come into\r\naction on some other point on the 26th, and that his policy would\r\ndepend on where that force appeared--he could only account for 30,000\r\nof Soult’s men so far. He did not commit himself to any definite guess\r\nas to the undiscovered part of the Marshal’s plan, but from his other\r\ncorrespondence it is clear that he suspected an attempt to relieve St.\r\nSebastian by an attack on the lower Bidassoa--a very possible solution\r\nof the problem, but not the correct one[899].\r\n\r\nAwaiting further developments, Wellington issued no more orders on the\r\nnight of the 25th, save one to the Conde de Abispal, directing him to\r\nsend one of his two infantry divisions from in front of Pampeluna to\r\njoin Picton and Cole, and to keep the fortress blockaded by the other.\r\nThe force thus taken away would be replaced by Carlos de España’s\r\ndivision, which was marching up from Burgos, and due to arrive on the\r\n26th. In this dispatch Wellington asked the Conde to direct Mina to\r\nsend up his infantry from Saragossa, and told him that he was intending\r\nto order to the front the British heavy cavalry brigades, now cantoned\r\nalong the Ebro. No other movements were settled that night; but\r\nWellington was aware that during his absence his Quartermaster-General,\r\nGeorge Murray, had directed Lord Dalhousie to have the 7th Division\r\nmassed at Echalar, prepared to move at an hour’s notice, and Charles\r\nAlten at Vera to have the Light Division got into a similar readiness.\r\nEither would be able to march off at dawn.\r\n\r\nSomewhere late in the night[900] Wellington received more news, which\r\nmade the situation clearer but more unsatisfactory. The true story of\r\nthe Maya fighting came in from two sources: Hill sent a dispatch dated\r\nfrom Elizondo at some hour after 6 p.m., to say that on getting back\r\nfrom the Alduides he had found Stewart unable to hold the Pass, and had\r\nbidden him to retire. Stewart, who was wounded and unable to write,\r\nsent a verbal message, which came in about the same time, reporting\r\nthat Hill had directed him to fall back on Elizondo and Berueta. The\r\nofficers who brought this information stated that the French were in\r\ngreat force, and that the 2nd Division had been much cut up. No more\r\nreports arrived from Cole, so that the result of the Roncesvalles\r\nfighting remained unknown.\r\n\r\nAfter what must have been a very short and disturbed night’s rest,\r\nWellington was in the saddle by 4 a.m. on the 26th, and preparing to\r\nride up the Bastan to visit Hill, and to ascertain the exact measure\r\nof the mishap at Maya. Before departing from Lesaca he gave his first\r\ndefinite orders in view of the events of the previous day[901]. Maya\r\nbeing lost, the 7th Division must fall back from Echalar to Sumbilla,\r\non the road to Santesteban: the Light Division must retire from\r\nVera to the west bank of the Bidassoa, and be ready to march either\r\ntowards Yanzi or towards Santesteban, as might be necessary. Longa’s\r\nCantabrians were to block the hill road from the Bidassoa to Oyarzun.\r\nGraham was told to hurry on the embarkation of the siege-train from\r\nSt. Sebastian. Hill was to hold on as long as he could to the position\r\nat Irurita, in order to keep touch with the 6th Division, which was\r\ndirected to feel towards him, and to be ready to join him if necessary.\r\nIt was to push two of its three brigades to Legasa, on the road from\r\nSantesteban along the upper Bidassoa, which would bring them within\r\neight miles of Hill’s proposed line of defence at Irurita. The third\r\nbrigade of the 6th Division was to stand fast at Santesteban, where it\r\nwould be in touch with Dalhousie, when the latter should have reached\r\nSumbilla.\r\n\r\nAll these orders, as is obvious, are concerned only with the measures\r\nnecessary to stop D’Erlon’s advance. None of them have any reference to\r\nthe action of the other French force at Roncesvalles. Till news should\r\ncome up from Cole and Picton, it was impossible to realize what was\r\ngoing on at that front, or whether the enemy was making his main attack\r\nin that direction. There might be still (as Wellington had guessed\r\nthree days back) a violent demonstration towards Pampeluna, intended to\r\ndistract a real attempt to relieve St. Sebastian.\r\n\r\nAnd this state of ignorance with regard to the southern theatre of\r\noperations was destined to last till late in the afternoon. Either\r\nCole and Picton themselves, or the officers to whom they entrusted\r\ntheir dispatches, were sadly lacking in a sense of the value of the\r\nprompt delivery of news. Wellington rode along the Bidassoa for many\r\na mile, till he came on Hill still holding the position of Irurita,\r\nand entirely unmolested by the French. There were now in line the\r\nsadly reduced remnant of the British brigades which had fought at\r\nMaya, and da Costa’s and Ashworth’s Portuguese, with the three\r\n7th-Division battalions which had saved Stewart from disaster. The\r\ntotal made up about 9,000 bayonets. Hill estimated[902] D’Erlon’s force\r\nat 14,000 men--a miscalculation, for even after the losses at Maya\r\nthere were still 18,000 French in line. The immediate result of the\r\nerror, however, was beneficial rather than otherwise, for Wellington\r\nconsidered that Hill was in no particular danger, and let him stand,\r\nwhile he himself rode southward towards the lofty Col de Velate, to\r\nseek for intelligence from the Pampeluna front in person, since his\r\nlieutenants had vouchsafed him none. He reached Almandoz, near the\r\ncrest of the Pass, in the afternoon, and resolved to establish his\r\nhead-quarters there for the night, as it was conveniently central\r\nbetween the two halves of his army.\r\n\r\nSoon after his arrival Wellington, being much vexed at receiving no\r\nnews whatever from the south, resolved to send the 6th Division toward\r\nPampeluna by the Col de Velate as a matter of precaution--they were\r\nto march to Olague in the valley of the Lanz. The 7th Division was\r\nto close in, to take up the ground where the 6th had been placed,\r\nand cover Hill’s left flank[903]. That haste in these movements was\r\nnot considered a primary necessity, is shown by the fact that Pack\r\nand Dalhousie were told that they need not march till the morning of\r\nthe 27th. For the enemy’s surprising quiescence at the head of the\r\nMaya pass had reassured Wellington as to any danger on this side. If\r\nD’Erlon, indeed, possessed no more than 14,000 men, Hill with the\r\naid of the 7th Division could easily take care of him. And the Light\r\nDivision might still be left near Lesaca, as a reserve for Graham in\r\ncase any new mass of French troops should take the offensive on the\r\nBidassoa.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon’s conduct on the morning of the 26th was explicable to himself,\r\nthough inexplicable to his enemy. He had been engaged in a most\r\nbitter fight, in which he had lost 2,000 men and more. Two British\r\ndivisions, so he wrote to Soult, were in front of him--the 2nd and the\r\n7th. For he had taken Barnes’s brigade for the whole of Dalhousie’s\r\nunit--the effect of its desperate charge almost justified him in the\r\nhypothesis. These troops had been forced to a strategic retreat, but\r\nby no means put out of action. They must have been joined, ere now,\r\nby the Portuguese column which Darmagnac had sighted on its approach\r\nto Ariscun. But there were also troops on his right, of whom he must\r\nbeware: he knew that Vera and Echalar had been held in strength, and\r\nGraham might send reinforcements in that direction, and assemble a\r\nheavy force on his flank. Hence he resolved to discover how matters lay\r\nby reconnaissances, before committing himself to the march down into\r\nthe Bastan and then up the Col de Velate which his orders prescribed.\r\n\r\n‘In my position on the pass of Maya,’ he wrote, ‘I had on my right all\r\nthe forces which the enemy had in line as far as St. Sebastian. I had\r\nto be prudent, in order not to expose myself to a check in the Bastan,\r\nin which the enemy was holding the strongest position. I therefore\r\ndetermined to leave Abbé and Maransin in the pass, with orders to send\r\nout reconnaissances towards Santesteban, Echalar, and Mount Atchiola.\r\nThey would profit by the halt to distribute the half-ration of food\r\nwhich had just come up from Ainhoue. I sent Darmagnac down the road to\r\nAriscun, with orders to push a vanguard to Elizondo, and to explore\r\ntowards the passes of Ispegui and Berderis, to see if there were any\r\nhostile force still on my left.’\r\n\r\nAn advance of six miles to Elizondo, and that by a mere advanced guard,\r\nwas all the movement that D’Erlon made this day. It was not till\r\nthe afternoon that he learnt, by Abbé’s reconnaissances, that there\r\nwere still allied troops on his right--apparently the Light Division\r\nopposite Vera, and the 7th at Sumbilla--while Darmagnac reported that\r\nthe eastern passes were clear, but that Hill was lying across the road\r\nbeyond Elizondo in great strength. In the evening D’Erlon heard that\r\nSoult had forced the pass of Roncesvalles, and was about to advance:\r\nthis success, he deduced, would make the enemy in front of him give\r\nway, in fear that his positions might be taken from behind. So he\r\nthought himself justified in ordering a general advance for the morning\r\nof the 27th--though Maransin was still to remain for a day at Maya,\r\nlest any allied force might move up from the west against the pass.\r\nThus it came that for the whole of July 26th Hill was unmolested, and\r\nSoult’s plan for a rapid concentration round Pampeluna became almost\r\nimpossible to carry out. A whole day had been wasted by D’Erlon, though\r\nhe was not without his extenuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nWellington meanwhile received at Almandoz, probably at about 8\r\np.m., the long-expected news from the South. They were, as we\r\nknow, most unsatisfactory: Cole reported from Linzoain, on the\r\nRoncesvalles-Pampeluna road, that he had been driven out of the pass\r\nby an army of 35,000 men or more, that he had not yet been joined\r\nby the 3rd Division, and was still retreating towards Zubiri, where\r\nhe understood that Picton would meet him and take over the command.\r\nHis view of the situation was shown by a remark that if he had not\r\nbeen superseded, and had been compelled to retreat past Pampeluna, he\r\nsupposed that the road towards Vittoria would have been the right one\r\nto take[904]. This most exasperating dispatch only reached Wellington\r\nthat night by mere chance. The officer bearing it was going to Lesaca,\r\nhaving no knowledge that Army Head-Quarters had left that place: at\r\nLanz he happened to meet the cavalry brigadier Long, whose squadrons\r\nwere keeping up the line of communication between the two halves of the\r\nArmy. Hearing from the aide-de-camp of the sort of news that the letter\r\ncontained, Long opened it and made a copy of it, which he sent to Sir\r\nRowland Hill, before permitting the bearer to go on. Hill received\r\nthe transcript at Berueta at 6 p.m., and very wisely forwarded it to\r\nWellington at Almandoz. The original was carried on by Cole’s messenger\r\nto Santesteban, and did not reach Wellington that night.\r\n\r\nThanks to Long’s and Hill’s intelligent action, the Commander-in-Chief\r\ncould grasp the whole unpleasant situation at 8 p.m. on the 26th. He\r\nsent orders to Picton at once, telling him that the enemy must at all\r\ncosts be detained: that considering the force at his disposal, he\r\nought to be able to check Soult for some time in front of Zubiri: that\r\nhe would be joined at once by one of O’Donnell’s divisions from the\r\nPampeluna blockading force, and shortly by reinforcements coming from\r\nthe Bastan (the 6th Division). Wellington himself was intending to ride\r\nover to the right wing by the next afternoon. Till he should arrive,\r\nPicton must send reports every few hours[905]. Unfortunately, Cole and\r\nPicton had got things into an even worse state than could have been\r\nexpected. Just as Wellington was drafting these orders for an obstinate\r\nrearguard action, they were at 8.30 p.m. preparing to evacuate the\r\nZubiri position, and setting out on a night march for Pampeluna[906].\r\n\r\nTo explain this move we must go back to the state of affairs at\r\nRoncesvalles on the very foggy morning of July 26th. Cole, Byng, and\r\nMorillo had abandoned, as we have already seen[907], their position on\r\nAltobiscar and the Linduz under cover of the night, and had all fallen\r\ninto the Pampeluna road, Ross’s brigade descending from the heights\r\nby the Mendichuri pass, the other three brigades and Morillo moving\r\nby the _chaussée_ past the Abbey and Burguete. Anson’s brigade formed\r\nthe rearguard, not having been engaged on the previous day. Morillo’s\r\noutlying battalion at the Foundry of Orbaiceta safely joined in by a\r\nhill path. Campbell’s Portuguese retired by the way that they had come,\r\nalong the Path of Atalosti, but instead of returning to the Alduides\r\nfollowed a mule track to Eugui in the upper valley of the Arga.\r\n\r\nCole’s long column, after completing its night march, took a\r\nmuch-needed rest for many hours along the high road near Viscarret. It\r\nsaw nothing of the French till the early afternoon, when an exploring\r\nparty of chasseurs ran into the rearguard of Anson’s brigade.\r\n\r\nWhat had Soult been doing between early dawn, when his outposts\r\nascertained that there was no enemy in front of them, and three\r\no’clock in the afternoon, when his cavalry rediscovered Cole? To our\r\nsurprise we find that he had been attempting to repeat his error of\r\nthe preceding day--that of sending a whole army corps along a rugged\r\nmule track, similar to the one on which Reille’s column had been\r\nblocked by Ross’s brigade. His original order on the 25th had been that\r\nReille, after seizing the Linduz, should turn along the ‘crest of the\r\nmountains’, occupy the Atalosti defile, and push ever westward till\r\nhe could threaten the Col de Velate, the main line of communication\r\nbetween the two sections of Wellington’s army. One would have supposed\r\nthat the events of the 25th on the Linduz, where one British brigade\r\nhad checked for a whole day Reille’s column of 17,000 men in Indian\r\nfile, would have taught him the impracticability of such plans. But (as\r\nSoult’s malevolent critic, quoted already above, observed) when the\r\nMarshal had once got his plan drawn up on paper it was like the laws of\r\nthe Medes and Persians, and must not be altered[908].\r\n\r\nWhile Clausel was directed to use the _chaussée_ and pursue Cole\r\nalong the Pampeluna road past Roncesvalles, Burguete, and Espinal,\r\nReille was once more ordered[909] ‘to follow the crest of the\r\nmountains to the right, and to try to take in the rear the hostile\r\ncorps which has been holding the pass of Maya against Count D’Erlon.’\r\nThe itinerary seems insane: there was a mule track and no more, and\r\nSoult proposed to engage upon it a column of 17,000 men, with a front\r\nof one file and a depth of at least six miles, allowing for the\r\nbattalion- and brigade-intervals. The crest was not a flat plateau,\r\nbut an interminable series of ups and downs, often steep and stony,\r\noccasionally wooded. Campbell’s brigade had traversed part of it on the\r\n25th, but to move a brigade on a fine day is a different thing from\r\nmoving an army corps in a fog.\r\n\r\nReille obeyed orders, though the fog was lying as densely upon the\r\nmountains as on the preceding night. Apparently Soult had supposed\r\nthat it would lift at dawn--but it did not till midday. Lamartinière’s\r\ndivision was left to guard the Linduz and the debouch of the Atalosti\r\npath: Foy’s, followed by Maucune’s, tried to keep to the crest, with\r\nthe most absurd results. It was supposed to be guided by French-Basque\r\npeasants (smugglers, no doubt) who were reputed to know the ground.\r\nAfter going no more than a mile or two in the fog, the guides, at a\r\nconfusion of tracks in the middle of a wood, came to a standstill,\r\nand talked volubly to Foy in unintelligible Basque. Whether they had\r\nlost their way, or were giving advice, the General could not quite\r\ndiscover. In despair he allowed the leading battalion to take the most\r\nobvious track. They had got completely off the Atalosti path, and after\r\ntwo miles of downhill marching found themselves on the _chaussée_\r\nnot far from Espinal, with the rear of Clausel’s corps defiling past\r\nthem[910]. It would still have been possible to stop the column, for\r\nonly one brigade had reached the foot of the mountain, and Maucune and\r\nLamartinière were still on the crest. But Reille took upon himself the\r\nresponsibility of overriding his commander’s impracticable directions,\r\nand ordered Foy to go on, and the rest to follow, and to fall in to the\r\nrear of Clausel’s impedimenta. ‘Il est fort dangereux dans les hautes\r\nmontagnes de s’engager sans guides et en brouillard,’ as he very truly\r\nobserved. Justifying himself in a letter of that night to Soult, he\r\nwrote that if it were absolutely necessary to get on the crest-path\r\nagain, it could be done by turning up the Arga valley at Zubiri, and\r\nfollowing it to Eugui, from which there were tracks both to the Col de\r\nVelate and to Irurita.[911]\r\n\r\nThus ended Soult’s impracticable scheme for seizing the Col de Velate\r\nby marching three divisions along a precipitous mule track. Even if\r\nthere had been no fog, it is hard to believe that anything could have\r\ncome of it, as Campbell’s Portuguese would have been found at Eugui\r\nwell on in the day, and after Reille’s column would have been much\r\nfatigued. Any show of resistance, even by one brigade, would have\r\nchecked Foy, and compelled Reille to deploy--an interminable affair, as\r\nthe fight on the Linduz upon the preceding afternoon had sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated. But to try this manœuvre in a dense fog was insane, and\r\nReille was quite right to throw it up.\r\n\r\nThe whole interest, therefore, of the French operation on July 26th\r\nturns on the doing of Clausel’s column. It advanced very cautiously\r\ndown the slopes to the Abbey of Roncesvalles, discovering no trace of\r\nthe enemy save a few abandoned wounded. Having reached the upland\r\nvalley of Burguete, Clausel sent out cavalry patrols, and found, after\r\nmuch searching in the fog, that Cole had gone off with his whole force\r\ntowards Espinal. His rearguard was discovered bivouacking along the\r\nroad beyond that village. When it sighted the French it retired towards\r\nViscarret. Clausel then ordered his infantry to pursue, but they were\r\nfar to the rear and it was only about 3 p.m. when Taupin’s division\r\ncame into touch with the light companies of Anson’s brigade, just\r\nas they were falling back on the whole 4th Division, drawn up in a\r\nfavourable position on heights behind the Erro river, near the village\r\nof Linzoain. The day had at last become clear and fine. The 31st Léger,\r\nleading the French column, exchanged a lively fusillade with the light\r\ncompanies, while a squadron of chasseurs tried a charge on their flank.\r\nBut both were driven off, and Clausel halted when he saw Cole waiting\r\nfor him in order of battle. It was not till he had brought up and\r\ndeployed two divisions that he ventured to press the Allied front, and\r\nnothing serious happened till after 4 o’clock.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Picton had come up from the rear, and joined Cole at\r\nLinzoain: the head of his troops had reached Zubiri only three miles\r\nbehind. The arrival of the truculent general, looking even more\r\neccentric than usual, for he was wearing a tall round civilian hat\r\nabove a blue undress frock-coat, and was using a furled umbrella by\r\nway of riding whip, was taken by the 4th-Division soldiers as a sign\r\nof battle[912]. ‘Here comes old Tommy: now, boys, make up your minds\r\nfor a fight’ passed down the ranks[913]. But, oddly enough, this\r\nwas about the only day in Sir Thomas’s military career when he did\r\nnot take a fair risk. He certainly came up in a bellicose mood, for\r\nhe ordered Ross’s brigade to be ready to move forward when the 3rd\r\nDivision should have come up to support it. But after riding to the\r\nfront, and holding a long talk with Cole, he agreed with the latter\r\nthat it would be dangerous to fight on ground which could be turned\r\non both flanks, with an enemy who was known to have 35,000 men in\r\nhand. Only part of the French were up--Reille’s divisions after their\r\nstroll in the fog were far to the rear behind Clausel--so it would\r\nbe possible to hold on till night, and slip away in the dark. Picton\r\nwrote to Wellington to report his decision, and does not seem in\r\nhis dispatch to have realized in the least that he was contravening\r\nthe whole spirit of his commander’s instructions of July 23rd with\r\nreference to the ‘stopping of the enemy’s progress towards Pampeluna in\r\nthe event of the passes being given up[914].’ He merely stated that he\r\nhad received these instructions too late to make it possible for him\r\nto reach Roncesvalles, or to join Cole before the latter had evacuated\r\nhis positions[915]. As there was no favourable ground between the Erro\r\nriver and the immediate vicinity of Pampeluna, on which a smaller\r\nforce could make an effectual stand against a much larger one, he had\r\ndetermined to retire at once, and proposed to ‘take up a position at\r\nas short a distance as practicable from Pampeluna’--by which he meant\r\nthe heights of San Cristobal, only two or three miles out from that\r\nfortress. He was thus intending to give up without further fighting\r\nten miles of most difficult hilly country, where the enemy could be\r\nchecked for a time at every successive ridge--though, no doubt, all the\r\npositions could be turned one after the other by long flank détours.\r\nBut the net result was that Picton gave Soult a clear road on the 27th,\r\nand allowed him to arrive in front of Pampeluna on that day, whereas\r\nthe least show of resistance between Zubiri and the debouch into the\r\nplains at Huarte, would have forced the French to deploy and waste\r\ntime, and they could not have reached the open country till the 28th.\r\nThis is sufficiently proved by the extreme difficulty which Soult found\r\nin conducting his march, even when he was not opposed.\r\n\r\nSo determined was Picton not to fight on the Erro river, or on the\r\nArga, that he did not bring up his own division from Zubiri, but let it\r\nstand, only three miles behind the line on which Cole kept up a mild\r\ndetaining action during the late afternoon hours of the 26th. Soult\r\nattacked with great caution, and more by way of flank movements than by\r\nfrontal pressure. By evening Cole had drawn back one mile, and had 168\r\ncasualties, all but four of them in Anson’s brigade[916]. Those of the\r\nFrench can hardly have been more numerous: they seem all to have been\r\nin Taupin’s division[917].\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 26th Picton had nearly 19,000 men at his\r\ndisposition[918], Soult had somewhat less, since Reille’s column was\r\nso far to the rear that it could not get up before dark. There was no\r\nwonder, therefore, that the enemy made no resolute attack; and it can\r\nonly be said that the Marshal was acting very wisely, for the French\r\nforce on the ground was not sufficient to move the opposing body, until\r\nReille should have come up; and Cole and Picton had resolved not to\r\ngive way before dark. But when the fires of the French, shining for\r\nmany miles on each side of the road, showed that they had settled down\r\nfor the night, Cole drew off his division, and retired on Zubiri, where\r\nhe passed through Picton’s troops, who were to take over the rearguard\r\nduty, as they were fresh and well rested. Campbell’s Portuguese dropped\r\ninto the line of march from Eugui, by orders issued to them that\r\nafternoon, and by 11 p.m. the whole corps was in march for Pampeluna.\r\nIts departure had passed wholly unnoticed by the enemy. Meanwhile,\r\nWellington’s aide-de-camp, riding through the night from Almandoz, with\r\norders to Picton to maintain the ground which he was abandoning, can\r\nonly have met the column when it was drawing near its destination.\r\n\r\nIt was quite early in the morning, though the sun was well up, when the\r\nhead of the retreating column reached the village of Zabaldica, where\r\nthe valley of the Arga begins to open out into the plain of Pampeluna,\r\nbetween the last flanking heights which constrict it. In front was the\r\nvery ill-chosen position which Picton intended to hold, along a line of\r\nhills which are quite separate from the main block of the mountains,\r\nand stretch isolated in the lowland for some five miles north-west and\r\nsouth-east. These are the hill of Huarte on the right, parted from the\r\nmountains by the valley of the Egues river; the hill of San Miguel in\r\nthe centre, on the other side of the high road and of the Arga river,\r\nand on the left the very long ridge of San Cristobal, separated from\r\nSan Miguel by the Ulzama river, which flows all along its front.\r\n\r\nNow these hills are strong posts in themselves, each with a good\r\nglacis of slope in its front; the gaps between them are stopped\r\nby the large villages of Villaba and Huarte, both susceptible of\r\nobstinate defence; and the two flanking hills are covered in front\r\nby river-beds--though fordable ones. But they are far too close to\r\nPampeluna, which is but one single mile from San Cristobal: the guns\r\nof the fortress actually commanded at a range of only 1,200 yards, the\r\nsole road of communication along the rear of the position. Cassan’s\r\ngarrison of 3,000 men was not large enough to furnish men for any large\r\nsortie--though he made a vigorous sally against O’Donnell’s blockading\r\ndivision on the 27th, and destroyed some of its trenches[919]. But no\r\narmy should fight with a hostile fortress less than two miles in its\r\nrear, and commanding its line of retreat: it is surprising that such\r\nan old soldier as Picton chose this ground--presumably he was seduced\r\nby the fine position for both infantry and guns which it shows looking\r\ntowards the enemy’s road of arrival.\r\n\r\nApparently Cole had a better eye for ground than Picton, for as they\r\nwere riding together between Zabaldica and Huarte, he pointed out to\r\nhis senior the advantage that would be gained by throwing forward the\r\nleft wing of the army to a position much more remote from Pampeluna,\r\nthe hill of Oricain or Sorauren, which faces the San Cristobal ridge\r\nfrom the other side of the Ulzama river[920]. This height is the\r\nlast roll of the mountains, but almost separated from their main\r\n_massif_: it is only joined to the next summit by a high _col_ at its\r\nright centre. For the rest of its length it is separated from its\r\nneighbour-height by a well-marked ravine. Its flanks are guarded by\r\nthe beds of the Arga to the right and the Ulzama to the left. It is\r\nwell under two miles long, about 1,000 feet high, and except at the\r\nCol has a very formidable front of steep slopes, covered with gorse\r\nand scattered bushes. The whole formed a strong and self-contained\r\nposition, whose weak point was that it was rather too much in advance\r\nof the Huarte-San Miguel heights, which trend away southward, so that\r\nwhen the army was drawn out its right was much ‘refused,’ and its left\r\nvery much thrown forward. It was also inconvenient that the access\r\nto the crest from the rear was bad, a steep climb by sheep-tracks\r\nfrom Oricain or Arre, up which all food or munitions would have to\r\nbe brought. From the north there was a slightly better path to the\r\nsummit from Sorauren, leading up to the small pilgrimage chapel of\r\nSan Salvador on the left end of the crest. But this would be of more\r\nuse to the assailants than to the defenders of the heights. Between\r\nthe Col and the river Arga, and close above the village of Zabaldica,\r\nthere was a spur or under-feature of the main position, which formed\r\na sort of outwork or flank protection to it. At the moment when the\r\nretreating army was passing on towards Huarte, this spur was being held\r\nby two Spanish battalions, part of the division which O’Donnell, by\r\nWellington’s orders, had detached to reinforce Picton. It was perhaps\r\nthe sight of this small force in a very good position which suggested\r\nto Cole that the right policy was to prolong his line in continuation\r\nof it, across the Col and as far as the chapel above Sorauren.\r\n\r\nHaving allowed Cole to take up his new advanced position, Picton drew\r\nout the 3rd Division on the hill to the right of Huarte, with its flank\r\neastwards covered by four brigades of cavalry, which had come up by\r\nWellington’s orders from their cantonments on the Ebro[921]. Morillo’s\r\nSpaniards continued the line westward along the Cerro de San Miguel,\r\nas far as Villaba: from thence the San Cristobal ridge was occupied by\r\nthe greater part of the division which O’Donnell had drawn from the\r\nblockading lines--all, in fact, save the two battalions in advance\r\non the hill by Zabaldica. Later in the day two battalions more were\r\nadded from the besieging force, for Carlos de España’s division from\r\nCastile had arrived, and relieved part of the troops which had hitherto\r\nbeen observing Pampeluna. Byng’s brigade was told off to support the\r\n4th Division, and took post on the rear of the summit of the Oricain\r\nhill, half a mile behind Cole. The actual fighting line on the left\r\nwas composed of Anson’s brigade on the Col, next to the Spaniards on\r\nthe lower spur, of Campbell’s Portuguese upon the central stretch\r\nof the heights (except one battalion which was sent to support the\r\nSpaniards below)[922], and of Ross’s brigade holding the left. Stubbs’s\r\nPortuguese were in rear of Campbell’s, except the 7th Caçadores, which\r\nwas detached to the front and held the ground about the chapel of San\r\nSalvador. The divisional battery (Sympher’s of the K.G.L.) was placed\r\nfar down the right side of the hill, below and behind Byng’s brigade,\r\nin a position from which it could sweep the high road from Zabaldica to\r\nArleta. Cole’s tactical dispositions were in the complete Wellingtonian\r\nstyle, with the light companies and caçadores thrown out some way\r\ndown the slope, far in advance of the main force, whose battalions\r\nwere drawn back well behind the sky-line, so as to be invisible till\r\nthe last moment to enemies storming the hill. Soult followed up the\r\nretreating Allies at such a slow pace that the whole of Picton’s\r\ntroops were settling into their ground before the enemy came in\r\nsight[923].\r\n\r\nThe slow advance of the French was due to the accumulation of such\r\na large force in a narrow valley provided with only one road. The\r\nMarshal made an attempt to relieve the congestion, by ordering that the\r\n_chaussée_ should be left to Clausel and to the cavalry and impedimenta\r\nin his rear, while Reille’s divisions should move on the east bank of\r\nthe Arga by local paths between the villages. The excellent intention\r\nof securing room for both columns to move freely had no good result.\r\nClausel arrived in front of Zabaldica by 9 a.m.[924] But Reille was\r\nnowhere in sight. His report fully explains his absence: he had\r\nobeyed orders by turning up into the hills a mile and a half beyond\r\nthe village of Erro. ‘This direction rendered the march of the three\r\ndivisions extremely slow and difficult. They found no road, and had\r\nto tramp through brushwood, climb steep slopes, or to follow tracks\r\nobliterated by recent rain. At last Count Reille took the decision\r\nto abandon the high ground. The 1st Division (Foy) dropped down to\r\nthe village of Alzuza on the extreme left. The 7th Division (Maucune)\r\nre-descended into the valley of the Arga, a little above Iroz, where\r\nit bivouacked. The 9th Division (Lamartinière) also came down into the\r\nvalley opposite Larrasoana, and kept along the high road to Iroz,’\r\nwhere it fell in with the rear of Clausel’s column late in the day. The\r\nonly result of Soult’s precaution had been to put Reille out of the\r\ngame on the 27th, just as on the 26th.\r\n\r\nFor the whole of the morning hours, therefore, Soult had only Clausel’s\r\ncorps at his disposition, a fact which accounts for the unenterprising\r\ncharacter of his action. But that the 27th was a very slack day on\r\nthe French side was not Clausel’s fault. On arriving at Zabaldica,\r\nand discovering that the heights of Oricain were held in strength,\r\nhe did not wait for the Marshal’s orders, but began to form a line\r\nof battle parallel to Cole’s front, along the mountain opposite.\r\nHalting Conroux’s division on the high road in face of the hill held\r\nby the Spaniards, he pushed Taupin’s and Vandermaesen’s divisions\r\nup the slopes, with cavalry detachments feeling the way in front\r\nof them, till they had lined the whole ridge, and their right was\r\noverlooking Sorauren and the valley of the Ulzama. He then sent down\r\nto ask the Marshal’s leave to attack, saying that he could see from\r\nthe summit behind his line large baggage trains moving away along\r\nthe Vittoria road in the plain of Pampeluna, and bodies of troops in\r\nmotion northward[925]--the enemy was about to raise the siege, and was\r\nonly offering a rearguard action in order to cover the retreat of his\r\nimpedimenta. If pressed he would give way at once[926].\r\n\r\nSoult did not believe this, and very rightly; but being pressed by\r\nrepeated messages he mounted up to the heights behind Clausel’s front\r\nat 11 a.m.: if he had chanced to notice it, he was just in time to see\r\na solitary horseman ride up the north-western slope of the hill of\r\nOricain, and to hear the whole of the Allied troops aligned opposite\r\nhim burst out into a storm of tempestuous cheering. Wellington had come\r\nupon the ground. Soult heard the noise, but (as his dispatches show)\r\ndid not guess its precise cause. He thought that reinforcements had\r\njust come up for Cole.\r\n\r\nThe story of Wellington’s eventful ride from Almandoz to Sorauren is a\r\nvery interesting one. Much irritated at receiving no further news from\r\nPicton, he had mounted at sunrise and ridden over the Col de Velate,\r\ntaking with him only George Murray, his Quartermaster-General, his\r\nMilitary Secretary Fitzroy Somerset, and three or four other officers:\r\nthe bulk of the head-quarters staff was to follow at leisure. On\r\narriving at Lanz, the first village on the south side of the pass, they\r\nheard rumours of Picton’s continued retreat, though they do not seem to\r\nhave met the aide-de-camp whom he had sent off on the preceding night\r\nto report it. This news was so unexpected and vexatious that Wellington\r\nhalted for a moment, to send back orders to Hill to the effect that it\r\nwas conceivable that affairs might go badly on the Pampeluna front.\r\nIf so, the whole right or southern wing of the army might have to\r\nswing back to the line Yrurzun-Tolosa, and Hill would have to direct\r\nhis own two divisions, and also Dalhousie, and Pack, with all the\r\nartillery and baggage, to fall back westward on Lizaso and Lecumberri,\r\ninstead of coming over the Col de Velate towards Pampeluna. The Light\r\nDivision, too, might have to leave the neighbourhood of the Bastan,\r\nand to retire to Zubieta on the Oyarzun-Lecumberri road, in order to\r\nkeep up the touch between the main army and Graham’s force in front of\r\nSt. Sebastian. The latter general, however, was not to move, unless\r\nmatters went very badly indeed, as the blockade of St. Sebastian must\r\nbe kept up till the last possible minute. But previous orders were to\r\nstand, unless and until the Commander-in-Chief should send new ones: in\r\nparticular Pack and the 6th Division were expected at Olague, and the\r\nbatteries of Silveira’s division and the Light Division might come on\r\nto Lanz, as there was an artillery road from Olague by which they might\r\nbe turned off eastward if it became necessary[927].\r\n\r\nOn getting five miles farther down the road, Wellington halted for\r\nanother moment at Olague, to leave word that the 6th Division[928],\r\nwhen it arrived, was to hold that place till further notice, and\r\nespecially to look out for a possible movement of the French across the\r\nhills from Eugui, which must be blocked at all costs. Pack must turn\r\nall wheeled transport, batteries, convoys, &c., arriving from the Col\r\nde Velate off the high road to Pampeluna, and send them westward by the\r\nside road Olague-Lizaso, at which last-named village everything must\r\nwait for further orders. The closest and most frequent communication\r\nmust be kept up with Hill’s corps, which would be wanting to use this\r\nsame road. Finally, Pack, after resting his division and giving it its\r\nnoonday meal, must be ready to march again at a moment’s notice in the\r\nafternoon[929].\r\n\r\nThree miles farther down the road, at Ostiz, Wellington found waiting\r\nfor him General Long, with some of the squadrons of his Light Dragoons,\r\nwho were dispersed all along the lines of communication, keeping touch\r\nwith all divisions. Long gave the alarming information that Picton had\r\nabandoned the Linzoain and Zubiri positions during the previous night,\r\nand was now in the immediate neighbourhood of Pampeluna, where he was\r\nintending to fight on the San Cristobal heights. The French were known\r\nto be in pursuit, and a collision might occur at any moment--indeed\r\nmight have occurred already, but no firing had yet been heard.\r\n\r\nOstiz is only four miles from Sorauren and six from Villaba; there\r\nwas probably time to reach the fighting ground before an action might\r\ncommence. Wellington directed his Quartermaster-General to stop behind,\r\nand make preparations for turning all troops off the Lanz valley road\r\non to the Lizaso road, if he should receive further orders in the next\r\nhour--everything depended on what was going on six miles away. He\r\nthen went off at racing speed down the _chaussée_, gradually dropping\r\nbehind him all his staff except Fitzroy Somerset--their horses could\r\nnot keep up with his thoroughbred. Turning the corner half a mile from\r\nSorauren, he suddenly came on the whole panorama of battle. Cole’s\r\nline was visible on the right-hand heights stretching away from the\r\nChapel of San Salvador to the Col above Zabaldica. On the opposite\r\nmountain Taupin’s and Vandermaesen’s divisions were moving along the\r\ncrest towards Sorauren and the Ulzama valley: cavalry vedettes were\r\npushing ahead of them all over the slopes, looking for paths or British\r\noutposts. They were only a mile away at most. There was just time,\r\nand no more, to join Cole and take over the direction of affairs.\r\nWellington put on full speed till he reached Sorauren bridge, and\r\nthen (with his usual cool-blooded calculation of risks and moments)\r\ndismounted, and wrote a short order to Murray in pencil, using the\r\ncap-stone of the bridge end as his table. While he was writing the\r\nthirteen hurried lines, he was much distracted by well-intentioned\r\npeasants, who flocked around him with shouts that the French were\r\ncoming down into the other end of the village. But the dispatch reads\r\nclearly enough. Murray is informed that the high road is blocked\r\nby the presence of the French at Sorauren; all troops, therefore,\r\nmust turn off on to the side-road Olague-Lizaso, both Pack and the\r\nartillery, and also Hill’s corps. The latter must march at once from\r\nthe Bastan, and get across the Col de Velate by nightfall if it could,\r\nleaving a rearguard to hold the pass against any possible pursuit by\r\nD’Erlon. The 7th Division near Santesteban should also come across by\r\nthe Puerto de Arraiz to Lizaso. Orders for the further movements of all\r\ntroops would be sent to Lizaso as soon as possible[930].\r\n\r\nFitzroy Somerset dashed out of the village at its northern end with the\r\ncompleted dispatch, just as the French chasseurs came exploring into\r\nits other end. He was not seen, or at least not pursued, and Murray\r\nreceived the orders, which made Lizaso the concentration point of all\r\nthe central divisions of the army in half an hour, and set to work to\r\namplify them and to forward them to their destinations. As Wellington\r\nvery truly observed, several hours were gained by sending back Somerset\r\nby the straight road, and in particular the 6th Division was able to\r\nreach Lizaso by dark, and to get a good rest for the march of the next\r\nday to the battlefield[931].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Wellington, now all alone, rode up the steep track which\r\nrises from Sorauren to the pilgrimage-chapel on the height above, and\r\nwas presently among the skirmishing line of O’Toole’s Caçadores, who\r\nwere holding that corner of the front. His familiar but unobtrusive\r\nsilhouette--the short frock-coat, small plumeless cocked hat fitting\r\ndown tight over the great Roman nose, and wiry thoroughbred--was\r\nat once recognized--the Portuguese set up the cry of ‘Douro,’ with\r\nwhich they were wont to greet him--recalling the first victory in\r\nwhich English and Portuguese co-operated, and also his first title\r\nof nobility: the noise swelled into the hoarse cheers of the British\r\nsoldier as it passed up the line towards the Col. The 4th Division,\r\nwhich had been grumbling bitterly since it had been on the retreat,\r\nsuddenly felt the atmosphere change. ‘I never can forget the joy\r\nwhich beamed in every countenance when his Lordship’s presence became\r\nknown. It diffused a feeling of confidence throughout all ranks. No\r\nmore dispiriting murmurs on the awkwardness of our situation: now we\r\nbegan to talk of driving the French over the frontier as a matter of\r\ncourse[932].’ Wellington halted in front of Ross’s brigade, and for a\r\nlong time studied the French movements through a telescope. He easily\r\nmade out Soult himself, who was conferring with Clausel and other\r\nstaff-officers in a conspicuous group. Napier says that he observed\r\nthat the Marshal would have heard the cheering, and would try to make\r\nout what it was about, before taking any serious step: ‘that will give\r\ntime for the 6th Division to arrive, and I shall beat him.’ There is\r\nno corroboration for this story, though it may be true: Napier was in\r\nEngland on July 28th, and speaks only from hearsay. But an eye-witness\r\npresent on the spot says that General Ross, as his chief continued\r\nto focus the French staff, ventured the remark that ‘this time Soult\r\ncertainly meditates an attack,’ to which Wellington, with the glass\r\nstill to his eye, replied, ‘It is just probable that _I_ shall attack\r\n_him_[933]. And this thought seems to be corroborated by a remark\r\nwhich Wellington made six days after to Judge Larpent, to the effect\r\nthat he should and could have done more on the 27th[934]. The French\r\narmy was but half arrived--only Clausel’s three divisions were up,\r\nand Reille was at 11 a.m. still miles away. The enemy was tempting\r\nProvidence by marching across the Allied front, just as Marmont had\r\ndone at Salamanca a year before.\r\n\r\nWhether Soult was stopped from an early attack, by guessing that the\r\ncheers on Cole’s front implied the arrival of Wellington, seems more\r\nthan doubtful. There is, of course, no trace of such an idea in the\r\nFrench dispatches--naturally it would not have been mentioned. But the\r\none personal narrative which we have from a member of the group of\r\nSoult’s staff-officers whom Wellington was eyeing, is to the effect\r\nthat Clausel was at the moment trying to persuade the Marshal to attack\r\nat once, though only half his force was up, that Soult utterly refused\r\nto do so, spread out his maps, and finally took his lunch and a nap\r\nafter it. ‘Clausel meanwhile leaning against an oak was literally\r\nbeating his forehead with rage, muttering “Who could go to sleep at\r\nsuch a moment”[935].’\r\n\r\nWhat is certain is that Soult’s dispatch to Paris says that he had\r\ndiscovered that Wellington had arrived _in the afternoon_, which would\r\nseem to show that he did not know by personal observation that he\r\nhad come up at 11 a.m. He says, also, that at the moment of his own\r\narrival the Allies had 30,000 men in line, including all the blockading\r\ntroops from Pampeluna, which rendered it necessary to make a thorough\r\nexamination of their position, and to get up all the divisions[936].\r\nTo discover the exact ground on which the enemy intended to fight, it\r\nproved necessary to make demonstrations or partial attacks.\r\n\r\nTwo of these were executed: the spur held by the two Spanish\r\nbattalions, above Zabaldica, was so close in to the French position,\r\nthat it was thought worth while to make an attempt to occupy it. A\r\nregiment of Conroux’s division was sent up from the village to storm\r\nit, but was handsomely repulsed, when near the top of the slope, by\r\na charge in line of these corps (Principe and Pravia of O’Donnell’s\r\nAndalusian Reserve). Clausel’s report says that his men ‘took the hill\r\nbut could not keep it,’ but many British eye-witnesses on the slope\r\nabove say that the summit was never reached. Clausel estimates the loss\r\nof his regiment at 100 men, Soult gives the more liberal estimate of\r\n200. The repulse showed plainly enough that the whole hill of Oricain\r\nwas to form part of the Allies’ position, and that they intended to\r\nfight for every inch of it.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Soult directed Foy, who had now reached Alzuza on\r\nthe extreme French left, to demonstrate against the heights of Huarte,\r\nso as to discover the end of the British line, and the strength in\r\nwhich it was held. Foy sent forward two regiments in column down the\r\nslope toward the Egues river, while showing the rest of his troops on\r\nthe hill behind. When the French got within cannon shot, Picton brought\r\nup the whole 3rd Division to the crest, and R. Hill’s and Ponsonby’s\r\nheavy cavalry showed themselves in front of the village of Gorraiz,\r\ncovering his flank. The divisional battery fired a few rounds at the\r\ncolumns, which at once swerved and retired in haste. Foy could report\r\nthat the Huarte heights were held in strength, and by all arms.\r\n\r\nThis was the last incident of the day--shortly afterwards a heavy\r\nthunderstorm swept down from the Pyrenees, darkened the twilight,\r\nand drenched both armies. The same thing had happened on the eve of\r\nSalamanca--and was to happen again on the eve of Waterloo.\r\n\r\nFar more important than the trifling skirmishes of the afternoon were\r\nthe arrangements for the morrow--orders and dispatches, which the rival\r\ncommanders were evolving during the evening hours. Soult felt himself\r\nstill blocked in the valley of the Arga and wanted to deploy--was\r\nit possible to get his long column of guns and cavalry out of the\r\ndefile--and if so, how? Was there a possibility of extending to the\r\nleft beyond Foy’s present position, or to the right beyond Sorauren,\r\nthe limit of Clausel’s occupation? Or must the Oricain heights be\r\ncaptured at all costs before the army could get into a proper order\r\nof battle? Could any immediate help be expected from D’Erlon, whose\r\ntiresome letter of the 26th had come to hand, showing that he was no\r\nfarther forward than Elizondo on that night? He was not doing his best\r\nto occupy the enemy in his front, and there was a danger that Hill\r\nmight arrive at Sorauren long before the corps that had been set the\r\ntask of occupying his attention.\r\n\r\nThere would appear to have been something like a council of war at the\r\nFrench head-quarters in the evening, in which Clausel, Reille, Gazan,\r\nthe Chief of the Staff, and probably other officers took part. Clausel\r\nwished to extend the line northward up the valley of the Ulzama, and\r\nto turn the flank of the whole Oricain position. The objection to this\r\nwas that the transport and guns could not follow over the mule-tracks\r\nwhich must be used; they were blocked in the Arga valley as long as the\r\nAllies held the heights commanding the main road. Moreover, reports\r\nhad come in that British troops were descending on to Sorauren by\r\nthe Lanz valley road, who would take in flank any attempt of Clausel\r\nto turn the Oricain position. (This seems to refer to the arrival of\r\nthe 6th Division at Olague, but Long’s cavalry was also visible up\r\nthe _chaussée_.) And an extension of the French right to the heights\r\nwestward would make the whole line of battle very long and weak:\r\nhow could Reille’s three divisions take over the whole ground from\r\nSorauren to Alzuza? After much discussion Soult decided in favour of\r\na concentric attack on the whole Oricain position by five of his six\r\ndivisions, while only Foy should remain out on the left, observing\r\nand containing the British force on the Huarte hills. Clausel’s three\r\ndivisions should attack Cole’s line from Sorauren to the Col, two of\r\nReille’s divisions should co-operate, by assailing the Col and the\r\nSpaniards’ Hill south of it. Some guns should be got to the front if\r\npossible, and Foy should be lent some cavalry, who must climb over\r\nthe hills to cover his flank. Details would have to be settled on the\r\nmorrow, also the transference of troops, who could not move in the dark\r\nover steep and unknown ground. Yet there was an uneasy feeling that too\r\nmuch time had been lost already--Soult notes a rumour that Wellington\r\nhad announced the approach of four more British divisions. Even the\r\narrival of D’Erlon could not compensate for this, and it did not look\r\nas if D’Erlon was likely to appear early on the 28th.\r\n\r\nWellington moved the troops who were on the ground very little\r\nthat evening--only relieving the Portuguese battalion which was in\r\nreserve on the hill above Zabaldica by a British regiment of Anson’s\r\nbrigade--the 40th Foot--and sending two of O’Donnell’s battalions to\r\nOllocarizqueta, to watch the mountain road west of Sorauren, by which\r\nit was conceivable that Clausel might try to turn the hill of Oricain.\r\nHe had got news that French troops had been seen beyond Sorauren,\r\nand did not want to have them prying too close behind this flank, or\r\nobserving the paths by which he intended to bring up his reserves on\r\nthat side.\r\n\r\nFor his main attention that afternoon was devoted to drawing up the\r\norders for the divisions coming from the Bastan, which he had promised\r\nto send to Murray, in the note that Fitzroy Somerset bore from the\r\nbridge of Sorauren. At 4 o’clock he sent off the all-important\r\ndispatch[937]. It will be remembered that his last orders provided\r\nfor the successive arrival at Lizaso of the 6th and 7th Divisions, of\r\nthe whole corps of Hill, and of the artillery, and divisional baggage\r\ntrains of all the troops.\r\n\r\nPack was to start from Lizaso at dawn, and to move as rapidly as\r\npossible along the country road by Marcalain to Ollocarizqueta, which\r\ngoes along the back of the hills that form the right bank of the valley\r\nof the Ulzama. At the last-named village (which he would find held by\r\ntwo Spanish battalions) he would be only five miles from Cole’s flank,\r\nand in a position to strengthen or cover it. A supplementary note[938]\r\nwarned Pack that if any French were found anywhere on the way he must\r\nnot let himself be turned off; even if it came to leaving the road\r\nand taking to mountain tracks, the 6th Division _must_ arrive at its\r\ndestination. The artillery and the reserve of infantry ammunition were\r\nto follow Pack, unless serious opposition were offered to him, in which\r\ncase they must return to Lizaso, and from thence turn on to Yrurzun.\r\n\r\nDalhousie and Hill had already had orders to march on Lizaso, the one\r\nby the Puerto de Arraiz, the other by the Velate. Both had a long\r\nmarch, but Wellington hoped that they might reach Lizaso during the\r\nnight of the 27th-28th. If the men were not over-fatigued, all three\r\ndivisions should follow Pack to Ollocarizqueta, after being given a\r\nsuitable time of rest. All impedimenta likely to hinder rapid marching,\r\nand the wounded from the Maya fight, were to be directed from Lizaso\r\nto Yrurzun. Murray had already, acting on the orders of the Sorauren\r\nBridge dispatch of 11 a.m., sent the route for Lizaso to Hill and\r\nDalhousie, adding some precautions of his own, to the effect that they\r\nshould leave small rearguards at the passes, to detain D’Erlon if he\r\nshould come up. Moreover, he had spread out the 1st Hussars of the\r\nK.G.L. along the roads, to keep up touch between all the divisions\r\non the move, and also between Lizaso and the Light Division, now at\r\nZubieta. The only addition made by Wellington’s new orders was the\r\nall-important one that everything of the fighting sort that came to\r\nLizaso was to march for the main army, but all baggage for Yrurzun.\r\n\r\nOf the arrangements thus made, that for Pack worked perfectly--he was\r\nat Ollocarizqueta with the 6th Division before 10 a.m. on the morning\r\nof the 28th. But Hill and Dalhousie were detained in the passes by\r\nthe storm of the evening of the 27th, and only reached Lizaso so late\r\non the 28th that they were of no use in the fighting of that day. As\r\nWellington observed to Larpent[939], they could both have got into the\r\nbattle of Sorauren if they had been given a longer march on the 26th,\r\nbut ignorance of Cole’s and Picton’s retreat had prevented him from\r\nstarting them early enough. However, the 6th Division alone sufficed to\r\nsettle the matter.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 28th was fine and bright--the storm of the preceding\r\nnight seemed to have cleared the clouds from the hills, and the eye\r\ncould range freely over a very wide landscape. Not only was the battle\r\nfront of each army visible to the other, but from the high crest on or\r\nbehind each position, a good deal could be made out of what was going\r\non in the rear. This was more the case with the French line than with\r\nthe British: Wellington’s usual plan of keeping his main force behind\r\nthe sky-line had great efficacy on such lofty ground as that of the\r\nheights of Oricain.\r\n\r\nSoult spent the long hours of the July morning in moving his troops to\r\nthe positions which had been selected on the previous night. Conroux’s\r\ndivision, abandoning Zabaldica, marched over the hills in the rear of\r\nClausel’s other divisions, and occupied Sorauren village--relieving\r\nthere some of Taupin’s battalions, which shifted a little to their\r\nleft. To replace Conroux at Zabaldica Lamartinière came up from Iroz,\r\nand deployed one brigade (Gauthier’s) in front of the Spaniards’ Hill,\r\nwhile the other (Menne’s) remained in reserve beside the Arga, with\r\ntwo regiments across the high road and the third on the slopes east\r\nof the river. Maucune’s division, starting up the slopes from the\r\nrear of Iroz, took post on the heights immediately opposite the Col,\r\nwith its right touching the left of Vandermaesen. Two regiments were\r\nin front line exactly in face of the Col, a third somewhat farther to\r\nthe left, keeping touch with Lamartinière’s brigade near Zabaldica.\r\nThe other brigade (Montfort’s) was placed in reserve farther up the\r\nmountain[940]. Pierre Soult’s light cavalry regiments disentangled\r\nthemselves from the long cavalry and artillery column in the rear,\r\nand picked their way up the heights southward till they reached Foy’s\r\nposition, from which they extended themselves to the left, till they\r\nreached as far as the village of Elcano. Four howitzers were chosen\r\nout of the batteries in the rear, and brought forward to the front of\r\nZabaldica, a position in which it was hoped that their high-trajectory\r\nfire might reach effectively the Allies on the Col and the Spanish\r\nHill. These were the only French cannon used that day, except some\r\nmule-guns employed by Clausel on the side of Sorauren.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of these movements were perfectly visible to\r\nWellington, though some of them were intermittently screened from sight\r\nwhen the marching columns dipped into dead ground, or were passing\r\nthrough thickets. They took up so many hours that he wrote to Graham at\r\n10.30 that it looked as if Soult was not inclined to attack. Meanwhile,\r\nthe only British force on the move was the 6th Division, which had been\r\nmarching since daylight, and arrived about 10 a.m. at Ollocarizqueta.\r\nOn getting news of its presence, Wellington ordered it to move by a\r\ncountry road which comes across a crack in the hills west of the Ulzama\r\nnot far from the village of Oricain, and after reaching that river\r\nto keep its Portuguese brigade on the western bank, its two British\r\nbrigades on the eastern, and so to advance till it should arrive facing\r\nSorauren, prolonging Cole’s left in the lower ground, and covering him\r\nfrom any attempt to turn his flank. About noon Pack’s leading troops\r\nbegan to appear--these were Madden’s Portuguese on the left of the\r\ndivision, working along the hillside west of the Ulzama.\r\n\r\nNow the ‘zero’ hour for the general attack on the whole Allied front\r\nhad been fixed by Soult for 1 o’clock, but long before that hour\r\nClausel was informed by an exploring officer, whom he had sent to the\r\nhills on the other side of the Ulzama, beyond his right, that a heavy\r\nBritish column was visible coming from the direction of Marcalain,\r\nobviously to join the British left[941]. Now the French general had\r\nbeen thinking of turning Cole’s flank on this side, and had actually\r\ngot troops some little way up the Ulzama valley beyond Sorauren. But\r\nhearing of Pack’s approach and of his strength, he determined that he\r\nmust now turn his attention to fending off this move against his own\r\nflank, and that the effort would absorb no small portion of his troops.\r\nConroux’s division had been originally intended for the attack of the\r\nnorth-west corner of the Oricain heights, to the right (French) of\r\nthe chapel, while Taupin was to make the chapel itself his objective;\r\nVandermaesen was to strike at the centre of Cole’s position, and\r\nMaucune to attack the Col. But Clausel determined that, in order to\r\nmake the general frontal attack feasible, he must at once stop the\r\nforward march of Pack, and keep him at a distance, while the other\r\ndivisions made their great stroke. Accordingly he called in his right\r\nwing detachments, and having concentrated Conroux’s strong division\r\n(7,000 bayonets) he ordered it, at 12.30, to deploy across the valley\r\nof the Ulzama below Sorauren and advance in two lines of brigades\r\nagainst the approaching British column. This movement--probably a\r\nnecessary one--brought on the first clash of battle, half an hour\r\nbefore the appointed time for the general movement. Clausel at the same\r\nmoment sent word to the other divisions to attack at once; but they\r\nwere not quite ready, the fixed hour not having yet been reached.\r\n\r\nBut Conroux pushed up the valley farther than was prudent, for when he\r\nwas some half a mile beyond Sorauren, he found himself encompassed\r\non three sides--Madden’s Portuguese pushing forward along the hill on\r\nthe other side of the river, turned in on his right flank, some of\r\nRoss’s skirmishers on the slopes west of the chapel of San Salvador\r\ncame down and began to fire upon his left flank, while the main body of\r\nthe 6th Division--Stirling’s brigade deployed in front line, Lambert’s\r\nsupporting in column--met him face to face in the low ground. The\r\nconcentric fire was too heavy to be stood, and Conroux had to give\r\nback, fighting fiercely, till he had the support of the village of\r\nSorauren at his back: there the battle stood still, for Pack had orders\r\nto cover Cole’s flank, not to attack the enemy’s[942].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the general frontal attack was being delivered by the other\r\nFrench divisions, starting from the right, as each got forward on\r\nreceiving Clausel’s orders to anticipate the fixed hour and advance\r\nat once. Hence the assault was made in échelon of brigades from the\r\nright, Taupin’s two brigades being a little ahead of Vandermaesen’s,\r\nand Vandermaesen’s perceptibly earlier on the hill than the brigade of\r\nMaucune which attacked at the Col. The separate assault by Lamartinière\r\non the Spaniards’ Hill is definitely stated by that general to have\r\nbeen made at 12 o’clock--earlier, apparently, than the others--but\r\nhe is contradicted by Reille, in command on this front, who says that\r\nit started _vers une heure_. This is much more likely to be correct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Second Battle of SORAUREN and Combat of BEUNZA _July 30,\r\n1813_]\r\n\r\nThe assault on the hill of Oricain bears a remarkable likeness to the\r\nbattle of Bussaco, both being attacks by a series of brigade columns on\r\na steep hill, with every disadvantage except numbers to the assailant.\r\nCole’s position was singularly like that of Picton in the battle of\r\n1810, the main differences being that the hillside was not quite so\r\nsteep or quite so high, and was strewn with clumps of brushwood in\r\nits lower slopes, while the Bussaco ground only shows heather and a\r\nlittle gorse. At the Portuguese fight the defenders of the hill had\r\nsome help from artillery--at the Navarrese fight none. On the other\r\nhand, Cole had a shorter line to defend, and more men to hold it.\r\nReynier attacked with 13,000 infantry--Clausel with 20,000--including\r\nin each case unengaged reserve brigades. Picton held the slopes of\r\nSan Antonio de Cantaro with 6,800 men--Cole had about 11,000 at\r\nOricain--the proportional difference therefore between the attacking\r\nand the defending force was much the same[943]. By an odd chance no\r\nless than four French regiments climbed both these deadly hills (17th\r\nLéger, 31st Léger, 47th and 70th Line); but the only officer who has\r\nleft us his narrative of both fights does not chance to have compared\r\nthem, though he was a competent observer and a fluent writer[944]. None\r\nof Cole’s regiments, on the other hand, had been engaged at Bussaco,\r\nthough eight of them were present on that field in unattacked sectors\r\nof Wellington’s line.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the attack of the six French brigades which mounted\r\nthe hill of Oricain was such that in their first advance Taupin’s right\r\nbrigade (Lecamus) attacked Ross; his left brigade (Béchaud) came in\r\nwhere Ross’s and Campbell’s lines met: both Vandermaesen’s were opposed\r\nto Campbell’s centre and right; Maucune’s front brigade tackled Anson\r\nat the Col, and Gauthier of Lamartinière’s division assailed the 40th\r\nand the Spaniards on the slopes above Zabaldica. The six brigades made\r\n15,000 bayonets in all--the rear brigades of Maucune and Lamartinière\r\nnot being counted, for they never closed. Conroux was paired off\r\nagainst Pack in the low ground, fighting against numbers not much\r\ninferior to his own.\r\n\r\nLecamus’s brigade, starting from a short distance south of Sorauren,\r\nmade for the north-west corner of the heights,--its four battalion\r\ncolumns screened by their eight _compagnies d’élite_ in a dense\r\nswarm[945], much thicker than the usual French skirmishing line. This\r\ncolumn, the first up the hill, pushed before it the light companies of\r\nthe British 20th and 23rd, and the 7th Portuguese Caçadores, and won\r\nits way nearly to the crest, when it was charged by Ross with the whole\r\nFusilier Brigade and thrown violently down hill. It was not pursued\r\nfar, and ultimately rallied, but was for some time out of action. The\r\nFusiliers had hardly resumed their former position and re-formed, when\r\nthe second French column came up the hill a little way to the left of\r\nthe last attack, aiming at the Chapel of San Salvador. This was the\r\nfive battalions of Béchaud’s brigade, which had in front of it the\r\nline of the 10th Caçadores, supported by Ross’s right-hand battalion\r\nand the left battalion of Campbell’s Portuguese. This column actually\r\nreached the summit, driving the Caçadores before it, and established\r\nitself by the chapel, but was finally thrown down by a flank attack of\r\nRoss’s left-hand battalions, while it was heavily engaged with the 7th\r\nFusiliers and Campbell’s 10th Line in front. It rallied only a short\r\nway down the hill, as there was no pursuit.\r\n\r\nThis fight was still in progress when Vandermaesen’s two brigades\r\ncame up the hill, each in a single column preceded by a heavy screen\r\nof _tirailleurs_. They came into collision with Campbell’s centre and\r\nleft, drove in his Caçadores[946] and light companies, and forced\r\ntheir way right to the summit, after a very sharp exchange of fire.\r\nCole was obliged to send up Stubbs’s Portuguese to strengthen the line,\r\nwhich held for some time, but finally gave way on its left, where the\r\n10th Line broke, thus exposing the flank of Ross’s 7th Fusiliers, its\r\nnext neighbours along the crest. At the same time Béchaud’s brigade,\r\nnow rallied, came up the hill for a second attack on Ross, whose\r\nline, or at least the right-hand part of it, lost ground and fell\r\nback in some disorder. At the same moment the French column beyond\r\nVandermaesen--Maucune’s front brigade--was attacking the Col. ‘At that\r\ninstant,’ wrote Clausel to Soult, ‘I had, despite all the difficulties\r\nof the enterprise, some hope of success[947].’\r\n\r\nThe combat seems to have stood still for a perceptible time--the French\r\ntroops had established themselves on a long strip of the crest, and\r\nwere slowly pushing back Campbell’s left and Ross’s right, which had\r\nsuffered severely and were in bad order. But the enemy was also in\r\ngreat confusion--the columns and the skirmishing line had dissolved\r\ninto irregular crowds. The men were absolutely exhausted by the steep\r\nclimb which they had just made; and the blasting volleys which they had\r\nreceived before reaching the crest had laid low a very large proportion\r\nof the officers, who had led with reckless courage. There was no\r\nimpetus left in their advance, which was slow and irregular.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the fight seems to have started on the very highest\r\npoint of the hill, where Maucune’s front brigade was attacking Anson.\r\nHere the French never won the crest, and were thrown back with extreme\r\nviolence and terrible loss. The laconic report of the division merely\r\nsays that ‘the advance was a complete failure: the troops were repulsed\r\nat every point, and returned to their original position with the loss\r\nof 600 to 700 men and a colonel[948].’ The whole strength of the three\r\nattacking battalions had been only 2,200 men, and all the casualties\r\ncoming in ten minutes, the column was too hard hit to rally. Nor\r\ndid Maucune choose to send in his rear brigade, which was the only\r\nintact reserve on the French heights. After watching this complete\r\nfailure of the central assault from behind Anson’s line, and noting\r\nthe demoralization of the enemy, Wellington took the very bold step\r\nof ordering two of Anson’s three battalions[949], the 3/27th and\r\n1/48th, to descend from their own ground, and fall on the flank of\r\nVandermaesen’s division, which was advancing slowly and in disorder,\r\npushing back Campbell’s and Stubbs’s Portuguese. He left only the 2nd\r\nProvisional (2nd and 2/53rd) to hold the high point from which Maucune\r\nhad just been repulsed. At the same time Byng’s brigade, hitherto kept\r\nin reserve a quarter of a mile back, on the centre of the hill, was\r\nordered to advance and support Ross.\r\n\r\nThe diagonal downhill charge of the 3/27th and 1/48th was swift and\r\nirresistible, when falling on the flank of a disordered mass. A French\r\nobserver on the opposite mountain noted and admired it. ‘The enemy’s\r\nreinforcements, which he launched against our divisions, charged at\r\na running pace, but with such order and unity that looking on from\r\na distance one might have thought it was cavalry galloping. Hardly\r\nhad they repulsed the troops on their right, when they ran in on the\r\ncentre, and after the centre on to the left.... Our men came back four\r\ntimes to the assault, but what could three divisions do against an army\r\nperfectly settled down into its position, which had only to receive\r\nthe shock of troops already half discomfited by exhaustion and by the\r\nobstacles of an inaccessible hillside[950].’ Wellington merely says, ‘I\r\nordered the 27th and 48th to charge first that body of the enemy which\r\nhad first established itself on the heights (Vandermaesen) and next\r\nthose on the left (Béchaud): both attacks succeeded, and the enemy was\r\ndriven down with immense loss.’\r\n\r\nByng’s brigade was in time to give assistance in the last part of the\r\nattack, but was only slightly engaged; its three battalions had no more\r\nthan 70 casualties among them[951], while the 27th and 48th counted no\r\nless than 389--a sufficient proof of the sort of resistance which they\r\nrespectively met.\r\n\r\nWith the general repulse of the French brigades which had established\r\nthemselves on the crest, the crisis of the battle was over. But\r\nsporadic fighting continued for an hour more, owing to the gallant\r\nobstinacy of the French officers, who at several points of the line\r\nrallied their battalions and brought them up the hill again for\r\npartial and obviously futile attacks. As Wellington had forbidden all\r\npursuit, the enemy had full power to reassemble half-way down the\r\nhill and to try his luck again. But since the men were tired out, and\r\nquite understood that if a general assault by six brigades had failed,\r\nisolated pushes by individual regiments were hopeless, there was no\r\nconviction in these later attacks. About four o’clock Soult sent orders\r\nthat they must cease, and that all troops must return to their original\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak of three side-shows of the battle, one of which\r\nwas of great interest and some importance. It will be remembered that\r\nwhen the great advance took place about 1 a.m., Gauthier’s brigade at\r\nZabaldica was told to storm the spur opposite, now held by the British\r\n40th and the Spanish battalions Pravia and Principe. There was some\r\nartillery preparation here, the howitzers beside the village having\r\nbeen directed to open a high-trajectory fire on the hill. It had,\r\nhowever, no effect, and the infantry were put in ere long. As to what\r\nhappened British and French accounts show a satisfactory agreement.\r\nGauthier first sent up the 120th, a strong three-battalion unit,\r\nkeeping the 122nd (two battalions) in reserve. The attack was frontal,\r\nand in one column--possibly the presence of Sympher’s battery to the\r\nright rear, sweeping all the slopes above the Arga river, prohibited\r\nany flank extension to turn the position.\r\n\r\nReille, who directed this attack in person from Zabaldica, says that\r\nthe regiment went up the hill with a very strong screen of skirmishers\r\n(no doubt all the six _compagnies d’élite_) but in great disorder, the\r\npace having been pressed too much up a very steep ascent, so that the\r\nwhole arrived at the crest in a mass. The enemy, who had been waiting\r\nbehind the sky-line, suddenly appeared at the critical moment, and\r\nopened such a heavy and effective fire that the 120th crumpled up and\r\nrolled down hill. The Allies, contented with the result of their salvo,\r\ndid not pursue, but stepped back behind the crest. Gauthier rallied\r\nthe defeated regiment half-way down the slope, and brought up the 122nd\r\nto assist: he then repeated the assault over the same ground, and\r\nwith better success, for the 120th reached the crest, and broke up a\r\nPortuguese regiment (it was really two _Spanish_ battalions), and came\r\nto a deadly musketry contest with the English regiment posted on the\r\nhighest ground. There was a fusillade almost muzzle to muzzle, but the\r\nFrench regiment finally gave way ‘whether from the disadvantage of the\r\nposition or from over-fatigue after twice climbing such steep slopes’.\r\nThe 122nd, coming up just too late, then delivered a similar attack,\r\nand suffered a similar repulse. Both regiments were then rallied\r\nhalf-way down the slope, and kept up from thence a scattering fire,\r\nuntil Soult’s orders came to withdraw all the line, in consequence\r\nof the defeat of Clausel’s divisions. This exactly tallies with the\r\nnarratives of the British officers of the 40th, who also speak of three\r\nattacks, the first easily foiled-a mere rush of skirmishers--the second\r\nvery serious, and rendered almost fatal by the incomprehensible panic\r\nof the Spaniards, who, after behaving very well both on the previous\r\nday and during the first attack, suddenly broke and fled--‘all attempts\r\nto rally them being ineffectual’--over the whole face of the hill\r\nbehind. The rout was only stopped by a desperate charge against the\r\nfront of the leading French battalion, which was successful contrary\r\nto every expectation and probability. For the 40th, who had suffered\r\nconsiderable loss in the combat of Linzoain two days before, had only\r\n10 officers and 400 men in line, and were attacking a column of nearly\r\n2,000 men. This column had been cast down hill, and the men of the 40th\r\nhad barely been re-formed--they showed a great wish to pursue and came\r\nback reluctantly--when the third French attack, that of the 122nd, was\r\ndelivered with resolution and steadiness but without success. Even\r\nthen the fight was not over, for after an interval the enemy came up\r\nthe hill again, in disorder but with drums beating and eagles carried\r\nto the front, the officers making incredible efforts to push the men\r\nforward. They did not, however, get to the crest, but, after rolling up\r\nto within twenty-five yards of it, stood still under the heavy musketry\r\nfire, and then fell back, completely ‘fought out[952].’\r\n\r\nReille’s report declares that Gauthier’s brigade only lost ‘50 killed\r\nand several hundred wounded’--say 350 in all--in this combat. The\r\nBritish 40th had 129 casualties--the Spanish battalions on their flanks\r\n192. If a brigade of five battalions and 3,300 bayonets allowed itself\r\nto be stopped by a single battalion in the last phases of the combat,\r\nafter suffering a loss of only one man in nine, there must have been\r\nsomething wrong with it, beside bad guidance. One would suspect that\r\nReille is understating casualties in the most reckless fashion.\r\n\r\nWhile this fight was going on by the banks of the Arga, there was\r\nanother in progress on the other flank of the hill of Oricain, on the\r\nbanks of the Ulzama. The 6th Division had been intermittently engaged\r\nwith Conroux’s troops during the whole time of the French assaults on\r\nthe heights. When it was seen that Clausel’s men were ‘fought out’\r\nand falling back, Pack made an effort to utilize the moment of the\r\nFrench _débâcle_ by capturing Sorauren. He brought up his divisional\r\nguns (Brandreth’s battery) to a position close to the village, and\r\nsent forward the light companies of the two British brigades to press\r\nin upon its south side, while Madden’s Portuguese, on the other bank\r\nof the river, tried to get into it from the rear on the north side.\r\nThe attack failed, indeed was never pushed home, Sorauren being too\r\nstrongly held. The guns had to be drawn back, many horses and some\r\ngunners having been shot down. Pack himself was severely wounded in the\r\nhead, and Madden’s brigade lost 300 men. Wellington sent down from the\r\nhill to order the attack to cease, for even if Sorauren had been taken,\r\nthe rest of his front-line troops were in no condition to improve the\r\nadvantage[953].\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on upon the extreme left, an almost bloodless\r\ndemonstration was in progress on the extreme right, where Foy, as on\r\nthe previous day, had been ordered to keep Picton employed. He showed\r\nhis infantry in front of Alzuza, and pushed forward the considerable\r\nbody of light cavalry which had been lent him to his left flank by\r\nElcano, till their skirmishers had got into collision with those of\r\nthe British Hussar Brigade, along the river Egues. There was much\r\n_tiraillade_ but few casualties on either side; the 10th Hussars were\r\ndriven across the river, but were replaced by the 18th, who kept\r\nthe French in check for the rest of the day. Pierre Soult showed\r\nno intention of closing, and Stapleton Cotton had been warned by\r\nWellington that his four brigades were intended for flank-protection\r\nnot for taking the offensive. The afternoon, therefore, passed away in\r\nnoisy but almost harmless bickering between lines of vedettes. Foy in\r\nhis report expressed himself contented with having kept a larger force\r\nthan his own occupied all day.\r\n\r\nThus ended this second Bussaco, a repetition in its main lines of\r\nthe first, and a justification of the central theory of Wellington’s\r\ntactical system. Once more the line, in a well-chosen position, and\r\nwith proper precautions taken, had proved itself able to defeat the\r\ncolumn. The French made a most gallant attempt to storm a position\r\nheld by much inferior numbers, but extremely strong. They were beaten\r\npartly--as all the critics insisted--by the fact that men who have just\r\nscaled a hill of 1,000 feet are inevitably exhausted at the moment when\r\nthey reach its crest, but much more by the superiority of fire of the\r\nline over the column when matters came to the musketry duel. The French\r\ngenerals had learnt one thing at least from previous experience--they\r\ntried to sheathe and screen the column by exceptionally heavy\r\nskirmishing lines, but even so they could not achieve their purpose.\r\nThe only risk in Wellington’s game was that the enemy’s numbers might\r\nbe too overwhelming--if, for example, the 6th Division had not been up\r\nin time on July 28th, and Clausel had been able to put in Conroux’s\r\ndivision (7,000 extra bayonets) along with the rest, operating against\r\nRoss’s extreme flank, it is not certain that the heights of Oricain\r\ncould have been held. But Wellington only offered battle, as he did,\r\nbecause he was relying on the arrival of the 6th Division. If he had\r\nknown on the night of the 27th that it could not possibly come up in\r\ntime, he would probably have accepted the unsatisfactory alternative\r\npolicy of which he speaks in several dispatches, that of raising the\r\nsiege of Pampeluna and falling back on Yrurzun. ‘I hope we should in\r\nany case have beaten the French at last, but it must have been further\r\nback certainly, and probably on the Tolosa road[954].’\r\n\r\nSoult is said to have felt from the 26th onward--his original project\r\nof a surprise followed by a very rapid advance having failed--‘_une\r\nvéritable conviction de non-réussite_[955].’ We could well understand\r\nthis if he really believed--as he wrote to Clarke on the evening after\r\nthe battle--that Wellington had 50,000 men already in line. But this\r\nwas an _ex post facto_ statement, intended to explain his defeat to the\r\nMinister; and we may be justified in thinking that if he had really\r\nestimated the hostile army at any such a figure, he would never have\r\nattacked. His long delay in bringing on the action may be explained by\r\nthe fact that Reille’s divisions were not on the field before evening\r\non the 27th, and that on the 28th it took many hours to rearrange the\r\ntroops on a terrain destitute of any roads, rather than by a fear of\r\na defeat by superior numbers. It might have been supposed on the 27th\r\nthat he was waiting for the possible arrival of D’Erlon, but on the\r\nmorning of the 28th he had heard overnight from his lieutenant, and\r\nknew that he could not reach the battle-front on that day. In his\r\nself-exculpatory dispatch to Clarke, Soult complains that D’Erlon told\r\nhim that he was blocked by British divisions at Irurita, ‘but I have no\r\ndoubt that these are the same troops which fell upon General Clausel’s\r\nflank this afternoon[956].’ In this he was wrong--D’Erlon was speaking\r\nof Hill’s and Dalhousie’s divisions, while it was Pack (whom D’Erlon\r\nhad never seen) that rendered a French success at Sorauren impossible.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the Allied Army was 2,652--of whom 1,358 were British,\r\n1,102 Portuguese, and 192 Spaniards. The heaviest casualties fell on\r\nthe 3/27th in Anson’s brigade, who first repulsed Maucune, and then\r\nswept away Vandermaesen, and the 1/7th in Ross’s brigade, the regiment\r\nwhose flank was exposed by the breaking of the 10th Portuguese--which\r\ncorps also, as was natural, was very hard hit. But all the front-line\r\nbattalions, both British and Portuguese, had considerable losses.\r\nSoult (as at Albuera) made a most mendacious understatement of his\r\ncasualties, putting them at 1,800 only. As Clausel alone had reported\r\nabout 2,000, Maucune about 700, and Lamartinière at least 350, it\r\nis certain that the Marshal’s total loss was over 3,000--how much\r\nover it is impossible to say, since the only accessible regimental\r\ncasualty-lists include all men killed, wounded, or missing between July\r\n25th and August 2nd. But the chances are that 4,000 would have been\r\nnearer the mark than 3,000[957].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII: CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSOULT’S RETREAT, JULY 30-31. THE SECOND BATTLE OF SORAUREN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the battle of July 28th was being fought, the outlying divisions\r\nof both Soult’s and Wellington’s armies were at last beginning to draw\r\nin towards the main bodies.\r\n\r\nHill, as we have already seen, had received the orders written by\r\nWellington on Sorauren bridge at 11 a.m. by the afternoon of the same\r\nday, and had started off at once with his whole force--the three\r\n2nd Division brigades, Silveira’s one brigade, and Barnes’s three\r\nbattalions of the 7th Division. His directions were to endeavour\r\nto cross the Puerto de Velate that night, so as to sleep at Lanz,\r\nthe first village on the south side of the pass. He was to leave a\r\ndetachment at the head of the defile, to check D’Erlon’s probable\r\nmovement of pursuit. The supplementary order, issued at 4 p.m. from\r\nthe heights of Oricain, directed Hill to march from the place where\r\nhis corps should encamp on the night of the 27th (Lanz as was hoped)\r\nto Lizaso, abandoning the high road for the side road Olague-Lizaso,\r\nsince the former was known to be cut by the French at Sorauren. If the\r\nmen were not over-fatigued when they reached Lizaso, Hill must try to\r\nbring them on farther, to Ollocarizqueta on the flank of the Sorauren\r\nposition, where the 6th Division would have preceded them.\r\n\r\nSimilarly Dalhousie with the 7th Division (minus the three battalions\r\nwith Hill) was to march that same evening from Santesteban over\r\nthe Puerto de Arraiz on to Lizaso, to sleep there and to march on\r\nOllocarizqueta, like Hill, on the morning of the 28th, if the state\r\nof the troops allowed it. All the baggage, sick, stores, and other\r\nimpedimenta from the Bastan were also directed on Lizaso, but they were\r\nto go through it westward and turn off to Yrurzun, not to follow the\r\nfighting force to Ollocarizqueta.\r\n\r\nNone of these directions worked out as was desired, the main\r\nhindering cause being the fearful thunderstorm already recorded,\r\nwhich raged during the twilight hours of the evening of the 27th.\r\nHill had started from Irurita, as directed, keeping as a rearguard\r\nAshworth’s Portuguese, who were intended to hold the Puerto de Velate\r\nwhen the rest of the column should have crossed it. He was nearing\r\nthe watershed, in the roughest part of the road, where it has many\r\nprecipitous slopes on the left hand, when the storm came down,\r\ncompletely blotting out the evening light with a deluge of rain, and\r\nalmost sweeping men off their feet. One of Barnes’s officers describes\r\nthe scene as follows: ‘So entangled were we among carts, horses,\r\nvicious kicking mules, baggage, and broken-down artillery, which\r\nlined the road, that we could not extricate ourselves. Some lighted\r\nsticks and candles only added to the confusion, for we were not able\r\nto see one yard beyond the lights, owing to the thick haze, which\r\nseemed to render darkness still more dark. In this bewildered state\r\nmany who could not stand were obliged from fatigue to sit down in the\r\nmire: to attempt going on was impossible, except by climbing over the\r\ndifferent vehicles that blocked the road. In this miserable plight, I\r\nseated myself against a tree, when weariness caused me, even amidst\r\nthis bustle, mud, and riot, to fall fast asleep[958].’ All sorts of\r\ndisasters happened: one of Tulloh’s 9-pounders went over the precipice\r\nwith the shaft animals drawn down with it, when the side of the roadway\r\ncrumbled in[959]. Ross’s battery lost another gun in a similar way,\r\nowing to the sudden breaking of a wheel, and many carts and mules\r\nblundered over the edge. The only thing that could be done was to stick\r\nto the track, sit down, and wait for daylight, which was fortunately\r\nearly in July.\r\n\r\nWhen it came, the drenched and miserable column picked itself up from\r\nthe mire, and straggled down the defile of the Velate, passing Lanz and\r\nturning off at Olague towards Lizaso, as ordered. Troops and baggage\r\nwere coming in all day to this small and overcrowded mountain village,\r\nin very sorry plight. It was of course quite impossible for them to\r\nmove a mile farther on the 28th, and Hill had to write to Wellington\r\nthat he could only hope to move his four brigades on the early morning\r\nof the 29th.[960]\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie had fared, as it seems, a little better in crossing\r\nthe Puerto de Arraiz; he had a less distance to cover, but the\r\ndispatch from Sorauren bridge only reached him at 7 p.m. when the\r\nrain was beginning. With laudable perseverance he kept marching all\r\nnight, and reached Lizaso at 12 noon on the 28th, with all his men,\r\nexcept a battalion of Caçadores left behind to watch the pass. The\r\ncondition of the division was so far better than that of Hill’s\r\ncolumn, that Dalhousie wrote to Wellington that he could march again\r\nin the late afternoon, after six hours’ rest, and would be at or\r\nnear Ollocarizqueta by dawn on the 29th[961], though two successive\r\nnight marches would have made the men very weary. This the division\r\naccomplished, much to its credit, and reached the appointed destination\r\ncomplete, for Hill had returned to it the three battalions which had\r\nsaved the day at Maya on the 25th.\r\n\r\nLizaso on the afternoon of July 28th was a dismal sight, crammed with\r\nthe drenched and worn-out men of seven brigades, who had just finished\r\na terrible night march, with large parties of the Maya wounded, much\r\nbaggage and transport with terrified muleteers in charge, and a horde\r\nof the peasants of the Bastan, who had loaded their more precious\r\npossessions on ox-wagons, and started off to escape the French. It took\r\nhours to sort out the impedimenta and start them on the Yrurzun road.\r\nThere was a general feeling of disaster in the air, mainly owing to\r\nphysical exhaustion, which even the report of the victory of Sorauren\r\narriving in the evening could not exorcise. Rumours were afloat that\r\nWellington was about to retire again, despite of the successes of the\r\nafternoon. However, the day being fine, the men were able to cook and\r\nto dry themselves, and the 7th Division duly set out for another night\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the retiring columns were not troubled by\r\nany pursuit either on the 27th or the 28th. The storm which had so\r\nmaltreated Hill’s column seems to have kept the French from discovering\r\nits departure. Darmagnac had moved forward on the 27th from Elizondo\r\nto ground facing Hill’s position at Irurita, but had not attempted\r\nto attack it, D’Erlon having decided that it was ‘_très forte par\r\nelle-même, et inattaquable, étant gardée par autant de troupes_.’ So\r\nbadly was touch kept owing to the rainy evening, that Hill got away\r\nunobserved, and it was only on the following morning that Darmagnac\r\nreported that he had disappeared. This news at last inspired D’Erlon\r\nwith a desire to push forward, and on the morning of the 28th Abbé\r\ntook over the vanguard, passed Almandoz, and crossed the Velate, with\r\nDarmagnac following in his rear, while Maransin--kept back so long at\r\nMaya--came down in the wake of the other divisions to Elizondo. The\r\nhead of Abbé’s division passed the Puerto de Velate, pushing before it\r\nAshworth’s Portuguese, who had been left as a detaining force. Abbé\r\nreported that the pass was full of wrecked baggage, and that he had\r\nseen guns shattered at the foot of precipices. D’Erlon says that 400\r\nBritish stragglers were gleaned by the way--no doubt Maya wounded and\r\nfootsore men. On the night of the 28th Abbé and Darmagnac bivouacked\r\nat and about Lanz, Maransin somewhere by Irurita. He left behind one\r\nbattalion at Elizondo[962], to pick up and escort the convoy of food\r\nexpected from Urdax and Ainhoue.\r\n\r\nThe light cavalry[963] who accompanied Abbé duly reported that Hill had\r\nnot followed the great road farther than Olague, but had turned off\r\nalong the valley of the upper Ulzama to Lizaso; his fires were noted at\r\nevening all along the edge of the woods near that village. One patrol\r\nof chasseurs, pushing down the main road to Ostiz, sighted a similar\r\nexploring party of Ismert’s dragoons coming from Sorauren, but could\r\nnot get in touch with them, as the dragoons took them for enemies and\r\ndecamped. However, the two bodies of French cavalry met again and\r\nrecognized each other at dawn on the 29th, so that free communication\r\nbetween the two parts of Soult’s army was now established.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon has been blamed by every critic for his slow advance between\r\nthe 26th and the 29th. He was quite aware that it was slow, and frankly\r\nstated in his reports that he did not attack Hill because he could not\r\nhave turned him out of the position of Irurita, not having a sufficient\r\nsuperiority of numbers to cancel Hill’s advantage of position. This\r\nis quite an arguable thesis--D’Erlon had, deducting Maya losses, some\r\n18,000 men: Hill counting in Dalhousie who had been placed on his\r\nflank by Wellington for the purpose of helping him if he were pressed,\r\nhad (also deducting Maya losses) four British and three Portuguese\r\nbrigades, with a strength of about 14,000. If Cameron’s and Pringle’s\r\nregiments had been terribly cut up at Maya, Darmagnac’s and Maransin’s\r\nhad suffered a perceptibly larger loss, though one distributed over\r\nmore units. D’Erlon was under the impression that Hill had three\r\ndivisions with him, having received false information to that effect.\r\nIf this had been true, an assault on the position of Irurita would\r\nhave been very reckless policy. It was _not_ true--only two divisions\r\nand one extra Portuguese brigade being in line. Yet still the event\r\nof the combat of Beunza, only three days later, when D’Erlon’s three\r\ndivisions attacked Hill’s own four brigades--no other allied troops\r\nbeing present--and were held in check for the better part of a day,\r\nsuggests that D’Erlon may have had good justification for not taking\r\nthe offensive on the 26th or 27th, while the 7th Division was at Hill’s\r\ndisposition. The most odd part of his tactics seems to have been the\r\nway in which he kept Maransin back at Maya and Elizondo so long: this\r\nwas apparently the result of fear that Graham might have something to\r\nsay in the contest--an unjustifiable fear as we know now, but D’Erlon\r\ncannot have been so certain as we are! The one criticism on the French\r\ngeneral’s conduct which does seem to admit of no adequate reply, is\r\nthat in his original orders from Soult, which laid down the scheme of\r\nthe whole campaign, he was certainly directed to get into touch with\r\nthe main army as soon as possible, though he was also directed to\r\nseize the pass of Maya and to pursue Hill by Elizondo and the Puerto\r\nde Velate. If he drew the conclusion on the 26th that he could not\r\nhope to dislodge Hill from the Irurita position, it was probably his\r\nduty to march eastward by the Col de Berderis or the Col d’Ispegui and\r\njoin the main body by the Alduides. It is more than doubtful whether,\r\nconsidering the character of the country and the tracks, he could\r\nhave arrived in time for the battle of Sorauren on the 28th. And if\r\nHill had seen him disappear eastward, he could have marched to join\r\nWellington by a shorter and much better road, and could certainly have\r\nbeen in touch with his chief before D’Erlon was in touch with Soult.\r\nNevertheless, it cannot be said that the French general obeyed the\r\norder which told him that ‘_il ne perdra pas de vue qu’il doit chercher\r\nà se réunir le plutôt possible au reste de l’armée_[964].’ And orders\r\nought to be obeyed--however difficult they may appear.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on the 29th, therefore, Soult’s troops were in their position\r\nof the preceding day, and D’Erlon’s leading division was at Lanz,\r\nrequiring only a short march to join the main body. But Wellington\r\nwas in a better position, since he had already been joined by the 6th\r\nDivision, and would be joined in a few hours by the 7th Division,\r\nwhich, marching all night, had reached Ollocarizqueta. Hill, with his\r\nfour original brigades, was at Lizaso, as near to Wellington as D’Erlon\r\nwas to Soult. The only other troops which could have been drawn in, if\r\nWellington had so originally intended, were the brigades of the Light\r\nDivision, for which (as we shall see) he made another disposition.\r\nBut omitting this unit, and supposing that the other troops on both\r\nsides simply marched in to join their main bodies on the 29th, it was\r\nclear that by night Wellington would have a numerical equality with\r\nhis adversary, and this would make any further attempts to relieve\r\nPampeluna impossible on the part of Soult.\r\n\r\nThis was the Marshal’s conviction, and he even overrated the odds set\r\nagainst him, if (as he said in his dispatch to Clarke) he estimated\r\nhis adversary’s force on the evening of the 28th at 50,000 men, and\r\nthought that several other divisions would join him ere long. In face\r\nof such conditions, what was to be the next move? Obviously a cautious\r\ngeneral would have decided that his bolt had been shot, and that he\r\nhad failed. He had a safe retreat before him to Roncesvalles, by a\r\nroad which would take all his cavalry and guns; and D’Erlon had an\r\nequally secure retreat either by Elizondo and Maya on a good road, or\r\nby the Alduides, if absolute security were preferred to convenience in\r\nmarching. The country was such that strong rearguards could have held\r\noff any pursuit. And this may have been the Marshal’s first intention,\r\nfor in his letter to Clarke, written on the evening after the battle,\r\nbefore he had any knowledge of D’Erlon’s approach, he said that he was\r\nsending back his artillery and dragoons on Roncesvalles, since it was\r\nimpossible to use them in Navarre, and that he was dispatching them to\r\nthe Bidassoa ‘where he could make better use of them in new operations,\r\nwhich he was about to undertake’. He was intending to remain a short\r\ntime in his present position with the infantry, to see what the enemy\r\nwould do. No news had been received of D’Erlon since the 27th, when he\r\nwas still at Elizondo, declaring that he could not move because he was\r\nblocked by a large hostile force--‘the same force, as I believe, which\r\nfell on Clausel’s flank to-day.’ Further comment the Marshal evidently\r\njudged superfluous[965]. The column of guns and baggage actually\r\nmarched off on the night of the 28th-29th.\r\n\r\nBut early on the morning of the 29th D’Erlon’s cavalry was met, and\r\nthe news arrived that he was at Lanz, and marching on Ostiz, where he\r\nwould arrive at midday, and would be only five miles from Sorauren.\r\nThis seems to have changed the Marshal’s outlook on the situation,\r\nand by the afternoon he had sketched out a wholly different plan of\r\ncampaign, and one of the utmost hazard. As the critic quoted a few\r\npages back observed, he recovered his confidence when once he was\r\ntwenty-four hours away from a defeat, and his strategical conceptions\r\nwere sometimes risky in the extreme[966].\r\n\r\nThe new plan involved a complete change of direction. Hitherto Soult\r\nhad been aiming at Pampeluna, and D’Erlon was, so to speak, his\r\nrearguard. Now he avowed another objective--the cutting of the road\r\nbetween Pampeluna and Tolosa, with the purpose of throwing himself\r\nbetween Wellington and Graham and forcing the latter to raise the\r\nsiege of St. Sebastian[967]. He had now, as he explained, attracted to\r\nthe extreme south nearly the whole of the Anglo-Portuguese divisions:\r\nthere was practically a gap between Wellington, with the troops about\r\nto join him, and the comparatively small force left on the Bidassoa.\r\nHe would turn the British left, by using D’Erlon’s corps as his\r\nvanguard and cutting in north of Lizaso, making for Hernani or Tolosa,\r\nwhichever might prove the more easy goal. He hoped that Villatte and\r\nthe reserves on the Bidassoa might already be at Hernani, for D’Erlon\r\nhad passed on to him an untrustworthy report that an offensive had\r\nbegun in that direction, as his original orders had directed. The\r\nmanœuvre would be so unexpected that he ought to gain a full day on\r\nWellington--D’Erlon was within striking distance of Hill, and should be\r\nable to thrust him out of the way, before the accumulation of British\r\ntroops about Sorauren, Villaba, and Huerta could come up. There was\r\nobviously one difficult point in the plan: D’Erlon could get at Hill\r\neasily enough. But was it certain that the rest of the troops, now in\r\nsuch very close touch with Wellington’s main body--separated from it on\r\none front of two miles by no more than a narrow ravine--would be able\r\nto disentangle themselves without risk, and to follow D’Erlon up the\r\nvalley of the Ulzama? When armies are so near that either can bring on\r\na general action by advancing half a mile, it is not easy for one of\r\nthem to withdraw, without exposing at least its rearguard or covering\r\ntroops to the danger of annihilation.\r\n\r\nSoult took this risk, whether underrating Wellington’s initiative, or\r\noverrating the manœuvring power of his own officers and men. It was\r\na gross tactical error, and he was to pay dearly for it on the 30th.\r\nIn fact, having obliged his enemy with a second Bussaco on the 28th,\r\nhe presented him with the opportunity of a second Salamanca two days\r\nafter. For in its essence the widespread battle of the 30th, which\r\nextended over ten miles from D’Erlon’s attack on Hill near Lizaso\r\nto Wellington’s counter-attack on Reille near Sorauren, was, like\r\nSalamanca, the sudden descent of an army in position upon an enemy who\r\nhas unwisely committed himself to a march right across its front.\r\n\r\nSoult made the most elaborate plans for his manœuvre--D’Erlon was\r\nto move from Ostiz and Lanz against Hill: he was lent the whole of\r\nTreillard’s dragoons, to give him plenty of cavalry for reconnaissance\r\npurposes; Clausel was to march Taupin’s and Vandermaesen’s troops\r\nbehind Conroux, who was to hold Sorauren village till they had passed\r\nhim. Conroux would then be relieved by Maucune’s division from the high\r\nground opposite the Col, and when it had taken over Sorauren from him,\r\nwould follow the rest of Clausel’s troops up the high road. Maucune’s\r\nvacant position would be handed over to Foy and Lamartinière. The\r\nformer was to evacuate Alzuza and the left bank of the Arga, where he\r\nwas not needed, as the column of guns and baggage, with its escort of\r\ncavalry, had got far enough away on the road to Zubiri and Roncesvalles\r\nto be out of danger. He was then to go up on to the heights where\r\nMaucune had been posted during the recent battle, as was also\r\nLamartinière. The latter was to leave one battalion, along with the\r\ncorps-cavalry (13th Chasseurs) of Reille’s wing, on the high road north\r\nof Zabaldica, as an extra precaution to guard against any attempt by\r\nthe enemy to raid the retreating column of impedimenta[968].\r\n\r\nFinally, some orders impossible to execute were dictated--viz. that\r\nall these movements were to be carried out in the night, and that both\r\nClausel and Reille were to be careful that the British should get no\r\nidea that any change in the position of the army was taking place;\r\none general is told that ‘_il opérera son mouvement de manière à ce\r\nque l’ennemi ne puisse aucunement l’apercevoir_,’ the other that ‘_il\r\ndisposera ses troupes à manière que l’ennemi ne puisse soupçonner\r\nqu’il y a de changement ni de diminution_.’ Reille was to hold the\r\nline Sorauren-Zabaldica for the whole day of the 30th, and then to\r\nfollow Clausel with absolute secrecy and silence. Now, unfortunately,\r\none cannot move 35,000 men on pathless hillsides and among woods and\r\nravines in the dark, without many units losing their way, and much\r\nnoise being made. And when one is in touch with a watchful enemy at a\r\ndistance of half a mile only, one cannot prevent him from seeing and\r\nhearing that changes are going on. The orders were impracticable.\r\n\r\nSuch were Soult’s plans for the 30th. Wellington’s counter-plans do\r\nnot, on the 29th, show any signs of an assumption of the offensive\r\nas yet, though it was certainly in his mind. They are entirely\r\nprecautionary, all of them being intended to guard against the next\r\npossible move of the opponent. The troops which had suffered severely\r\nin the battle were drawn back into second line, Byng’s and Stubbs’s\r\nbrigades taking over the ground held by Ross and Campbell. The 6th\r\nDivision--now under Pakenham, Pack having been severely wounded on the\r\nprevious day--occupied the heights north-west of Sorauren, continuing\r\nthe line held on the 28th to the left. Both Cole and Pakenham were told\r\nto get their guns up, if possible. And when Lord Dalhousie came up from\r\nLizaso after his night march, his division also was placed to prolong\r\nthe allied left--two brigades to the left-rear of the 6th Division,\r\nhidden behind a high ridge, the third several miles westward over a\r\nhill which commanded the by-road Ostiz-Marcalain--a possible route for\r\na French turning movement[969].\r\n\r\nOriginally Wellington had supposed that Hill would reach Lizaso earlier\r\nthan Dalhousie, and had intended that the 2nd Division should come\r\ndown towards Marcalain and Pampeluna, while the 7th remained at Lizaso\r\nto protect the junction of roads. But the storm, which smote Hill\r\nworse than it smote Dalhousie, had settled matters otherwise. It was\r\nthe latter, not the former, who turned up to join hands with the main\r\narmy. Accepting the change, Wellington directed Hill to select a good\r\nfighting position by Lizaso, in which he should place the two English\r\nbrigades of the 2nd Division and Ashworth, while Da Costa’s Portuguese\r\nwere to move to Marcalain[970], close to the rear brigade which the 7th\r\nDivision had left in the neighbourhood. Thus something like a covering\r\nline was provided for any move which D’Erlon might make against the\r\nBritish left. Wellington was feeling very jealous that day of attempts\r\nto turn this flank, and took one more precaution which (as matters were\r\nto turn out) he was much to regret on the 31st. Orders were sent to\r\nCharles Alten to move the Light Division from Zubieta towards the high\r\nroad that goes from Tolosa to Yrurzun via Lecumberri. In ignorance of\r\nthe division’s exact position, the dispatch directed Alten to come down\r\nso far as might seem best--Yrurzun being named as the farthest point\r\nwhich should be taken into consideration[971]. This caused Alten to\r\nmove, by a very toilsome night march, from Zubieta, where he would have\r\nbeen very useful later on, to Lecumberri, where (as it chanced) he was\r\nnot needed. But this was a hazard of war--it was impossible to guess\r\non the 29th the unlikely place where Soult’s army was about to be on\r\nthe 31st. Another move of troops to the Yrurzun road was that Fane’s\r\ncavalry brigade, newly arrived from the side of Aragon, was directed to\r\nBerrioplano, behind Pampeluna on the Vittoria road, with orders to get\r\ninto touch with Lizaso, Yrurzun, and Lecumberri.\r\n\r\nObviously all these arrangements were defensive, and contemplated\r\nthree possible moves on the part of the enemy--(1) a renewal of the\r\nbattle of the 28th at and north of Sorauren, with which the 6th and\r\n7th Divisions could deal; (2) an attempt to turn the allied flank on\r\nthe short circuit Ostiz-Marcalain; (3) a similar attempt by a larger\r\ncircuit via Lizaso, which would enable the enemy to get on to the roads\r\nLizaso-Yrurzun, and Lizaso-Lecumberri, and so cut the communication\r\nbetween Wellington and Graham. The third was the correct reading of\r\nSoult’s intentions. To foil it Hill was in position at Lizaso, with the\r\npower to call in first Da Costa, then the 7th Division, and much later\r\nthe Light Division, whose whereabouts was uncertain, and whose arrival\r\nmust obviously come very late. But if the enemy should attack Hill with\r\nanything more than the body of troops which had been seen at Ostiz and\r\nLanz (D’Erlon’s corps), Wellington intended to fall upon their main\r\ncorps, so soon as it began to show signs of detaching reinforcements to\r\njoin the turning or enveloping column.\r\n\r\nSoult’s manœuvre had duly begun on the night of the 28th-29th by the\r\nretreat of the artillery, the wounded, the train and heavy baggage\r\ntowards Roncesvalles, under the escort of the dragoon regiments of\r\nPierre Soult’s division, whose chasseur regiments, however, remained\r\nwith Reille as ‘corps cavalry’. On the news of this move going round,\r\na general impression prevailed that the whole army was about to retire\r\nby the road on which it had come up. This seemed all the more likely\r\nbecause the last of the rations brought from St. Jean-Pied-du-Port\r\nhad been distributed on the battle-morning, and the troops had been\r\ntold on the 29th to make raids for food on all the mountain villages\r\non their flanks and rear. They had found little save wine--which was\r\nmore a snare than a help. The perspicacious Foy noted in his diary his\r\nimpression that Soult’s new move was not made with any real hope of\r\nrelieving St. Sebastian or cutting the Allies’ communication, it was\r\nin essence a retreat; but, to save his face, the Marshal was trying\r\nto give it the appearance of a strategic manœuvre[972]. This was a\r\nvery legitimate deduction--it certainly seemed unlikely that an army\r\nshort of food, and almost equally short of munitions, could be asked\r\nto conduct a long campaign in a region where it was notorious that it\r\ncould not hope to live by requisitions, and would find communication\r\nwith its base almost impossible. It was true that convoys were coming\r\nup behind D’Erlon--one was due at Elizondo--but roads were bad and\r\nappointments hard to keep. There were orders sent to Bayonne on the\r\n28th for the start of another--but how many days would it take before\r\nthe army got the benefit?--a week at least. Men and officers marched\r\noff on the new adventure grumbling and with stomachs ill-filled.\r\n\r\nThe result of Soult’s orders was to produce two separate actions on the\r\n30th--one between D’Erlon and Hill behind Lizaso, in which the French\r\ngained a tactical advantage of no great importance, the other on the\r\nheights along the Ulzama between Wellington’s main body and Clausel and\r\nReille, in which the French rear divisions were so routed and dispersed\r\nthat Soult had to throw up all his ambitious plans, and rush home for\r\nsafety as fast as was possible.\r\n\r\nThe more important action, generally called the Second Battle of\r\nSorauren, may be dealt with first.\r\n\r\nAt midnight Clausel’s two divisions on the heights, separated from\r\nCole’s position by the great ravine, moved off, leaving their fires\r\nburning. By dawn they had safely arrived on the high road between\r\nSorauren and Ostiz, and were ready to move on towards D’Erlon when\r\nthe third division--Conroux’s--should have been relieved at Sorauren\r\nvillage by Maucune. But this had not yet been accomplished, even by\r\nfive in the morning: for Maucune’s troops having woods and pathless\r\nslopes to cross, in great part lost their way, and were straggling in\r\nsmall bands over the hills during the night. They had only two miles\r\nto go in many cases, yet when the light came some of them were still\r\nfar from their destination and in quite unexpected places. Conroux had\r\ndisentangled one brigade from Sorauren, while the other was still\r\nholding the outposts, and Maucune was just beginning to file some of\r\nhis men behind the barricades and defences, when the whole of the\r\nvillage received a salvo of shells, which brought death and confusion\r\neverywhere. During the night Pakenham and Cole, obeying Wellington’s\r\norders, had succeeded in getting some guns up to the crest of the\r\nheights--the 6th Division had hauled six guns up the hill on its left:\r\nthey were now mounted in front of Madden’s Portuguese, only 500 yards\r\nfrom their mark[973]. Of the 4th Division battery[974] two guns and a\r\nhowitzer had been dragged with immense toil to the neighbourhood of the\r\nchapel of San Salvador, overlooking Sorauren, the other three guns to\r\na point farther east, opposite the front from which Vandermaesen had\r\nattacked on the 28th.\r\n\r\nThis was apparently the commencement of the action, but it soon started\r\non several other points. Foy had evacuated Alzuza at midnight, but\r\nhaving rough country-paths in a steep hillside as his only guides in\r\nthe darkness, had not succeeded in massing his division at Iroz till 5\r\na.m. He then mounted the heights in his immediate front, pushing before\r\nhim (as he says) fractions of Maucune’s division which had lost their\r\nway. His long column had got as far as the Col and the ground west\r\nof it, when--full daylight now prevailing--he began to be shelled by\r\nguns from the opposite heights--obviously the other half of Sympher’s\r\nbattery[975].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lamartinière’s division (minus the one battalion of the\r\n122nd left to watch the Roncesvalles road) had moved very little in\r\nthe night, having only drawn itself up from Zabaldica to the heights\r\nimmediately to the left of the Col, where it lay in two lines of\r\nbrigades, the front one facing the Spaniards’ Hill, the rear one\r\na few hundred yards back. Foy, coming from Iroz, had marched past\r\nLamartinière’s rear, covered by him till he got west of the Col. This\r\ndivision was not shelled, as Conroux, Maucune, and Foy had all been,\r\nbut noted with disquiet that British troops were streaming up from\r\nHuarte on the Roncesvalles road, with the obvious intention of turning\r\nits left, and getting possession of the main route to France.\r\n\r\nWellington, as it chanced, was in the most perfect condition to take\r\nadvantage of the mistake which Soult had made in planning to withdraw\r\nhis troops by a march right across the front of the allied army in\r\nposition. The night-movements of the French had been heard, and under\r\nthe idea that they might portend a new attack, all the divisions\r\nhad been put under arms an hour before dawn. The guns, too, were in\r\nposition, only waiting for their mark to become visible--it had been\r\nintended to shell the French out of Sorauren in any case that morning.\r\nWellington had risen early as usual, and was on the look-out place on\r\nthe Oricain heights which he used as his post on the 28th and 29th.\r\nWhen the panorama on the opposite mountain became visible to him, he\r\nhad only to send orders for a general frontal attack, for which the\r\ntroops were perfectly placed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the 6th Division attacked Sorauren village at once, while\r\nthe troops on the Oricain heights descended, a little later, in two\r\nlines--the front one formed of Byng’s brigade, Stubbs’s Portuguese,\r\nand the 40th and Provisional Battalion of Anson’s--while Ross’s\r\nbrigade and Anson’s two other battalions (the troops which had taken\r\nthe worst knocks on the 28th) formed the reserve line. Preceded by\r\ntheir skirmishers, Byng’s battalions made for Sorauren, Cole’s marched\r\nstraight for Foy’s troops on the opposite hills[976]. Farther to the\r\nright Picton had discovered already that there was no longer any French\r\nforce opposite him, and had got his division assembled for an advance\r\nalong the Roncesvalles road. He would seem to have been inclined to\r\ngo a little farther than Wellington thought prudent, as there was a\r\ndispatch sent to him at 8 a.m. bidding him to advance no farther, until\r\nit was certain that all was clear on the left, though he might push\r\nforward light troops on the heights east of the Arga river. He did\r\nnot therefore get into touch with Lamartinière on the mountain above\r\nZabaldica for some time after Foy and Maucune had been attacked.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it was not only to the old fighting-ground of the 28th that\r\nthe attack was confined. Wellington ordered Lord Dalhousie to emerge\r\nfrom the shelter of the hills beyond the left of the 6th Division, and\r\nto assail the troops below him in the Ulzama valley--that is Taupin’s\r\nand Vandermaesen’s divisions, halted by Clausel some way short of\r\nOstiz, when the sound of firing began near Sorauren.\r\n\r\nThe French units which were in the greatest danger were the three\r\ndivisions of Conroux, Maucune, and Foy, all suddenly caught under the\r\nartillery fire of an enemy whom they had not believed to possess any\r\nguns in line. Troops marching in column are very helpless when saluted\r\nin this fashion. Foy writes ‘we had not been intending to fight, and\r\nsuddenly we found ourselves massed under the fire of the enemy’s\r\ncannon. We were forced to go up the mountain side to get out of range;\r\nwe should have to retreat, and we already saw that we should be turned\r\non both flanks by the two valleys on our left and right.... General\r\nReille only sent part of my division up on to the high crests after\r\nits masses had been well played upon by an enemy whose artillery fire\r\nis most accurate[977].’ Now Foy could, after all, get out of range by\r\ngoing up hill--but Maucune and Conroux were in and about a village\r\nwhich it was their duty to hold, since they had to cover the retreat of\r\nFoy and Lamartinière across their rear. If Sorauren were lost, Reille’s\r\ntwo left divisions would be driven away from the main army--perhaps\r\neven cut off. Yet it was a hard business to hold a village under a\r\nclose-range artillery fire from commanding ground, which enfiladed it\r\non both sides, when the enemy’s infantry intervened. Pakenham sent\r\nMadden’s Portuguese round the village on the north--where they drove\r\nin one regiment[978] which Conroux had thrown out as a flank guard on\r\nthe west bank of the Ulzama, and then proceeded to push round the rear\r\nof the place. At the same time the left wing of the troops which had\r\ndescended from the chapel of San Salvador (Byng’s brigade) began to\r\nenvelop Sorauren on the eastern flank. And frontally it was attacked by\r\nthe light companies of Lambert’s brigade of the 6th Division.\r\n\r\nConroux’s first brigade (Rey’s) had succeeded in getting away to the\r\nnorth of the village before it was completely surrounded, and, after\r\nbickerings with Madden’s Portuguese and other 6th Division troops,\r\nfinally straggled across the hills to Ostiz. His other brigade,\r\nhowever, and all Maucune’s division were very nearly exterminated.\r\nThey made an obstinate defence of Sorauren for nearly two hours, till\r\nthe place was entirely encompassed: Maucune says that he cleared a way\r\nfor the more compromised units by a charge which retook part of the\r\nvillage, and then led the whole mass up the hill. The bulk of them\r\nscraped through, but were intercepted by 4th Division troops in the\r\nhollow hillside above. One whole battalion was forced to surrender,\r\nand great part of two others; there were 1,700 unwounded prisoners\r\ntaken, of whom 1,100 belonged to Maucune and 600 to Conroux’s rear\r\nbrigade[979].\r\n\r\nMaucune’s division was practically destroyed: having reported 600\r\ncasualties on the 28th, he reported 1,800 more on the 30th, and as his\r\ntotal strength was only 4,186, it is clear that only 1,700 men got\r\naway. The general and the survivors rallied in to Foy on the heights\r\nabove, along with the wrecks of Conroux’s second brigade, which lost\r\n1,000 men: the first brigade, though less hard hit, seems to have had\r\n500 or 600 casualties, and many stragglers. Altogether both divisions\r\nwere no longer a real fighting force during the rest of the campaign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there had been a distinct and separate combat going on\r\nfarther up the Ulzama valley. When the fighting in and about Sorauren\r\nbegan, Clausel had halted Vandermaesen’s and Taupin’s division at a\r\ndefile near the village of Olabe, knowing that if he continued on his\r\nway towards Ostiz and Olague Reille’s wing would be completely cut off\r\nfrom him. Having seen suspicious movements in the hills on his left, he\r\nsent up two battalions from Vandermaesen’s division to hold the heights\r\nimmediately beyond the river and cover his flank. The precaution\r\nwas wise but insufficient: somewhere about 8.30 a.m. the British 7th\r\nDivision, having received its orders to join in the general attack,\r\ncame up from its concealed position in the rear, and fell upon the\r\ncovering troops, who were driven off their steep position by Inglis’s\r\nbrigade, and thrown down on to the main body of Clausel’s troops in the\r\nvalley. There was close and bloody fighting in the bottom, ‘a small\r\nlevel covered with small bushes of underwood,’ but after a time the\r\nFrench gave way. Vandermaesen’s men soon got locked in a stationary\r\nfight with Inglis’s battalions, but the two other 7th Division brigades\r\n(Le Cor and Barnes) which had not descended to the river and the road,\r\nwere plying Taupin’s column with a steady fire from the slope of the\r\nopposite bank, which made standing still impossible[980]. Having to\r\nchoose between attacking or retreating, Clausel opted for the easier\r\nalternative, and drew off. In his report to Soult he gives as his\r\nreason the fact that Sorauren had now been lost, that Reille’s troops\r\nwere streaming over the hills in disorder, and that it was no use\r\nwaiting any longer to cover their retreat, which was not going to\r\nbe by the road, but broadcast across the mountains. Accordingly he\r\ndisengaged himself as best he could, and retreated up the _chaussée_\r\nfollowed by the 7th Division, which naturally took some time to get\r\ninto order. Inglis’s brigade followed by the road, presently supported\r\nby Byng’s troops, who came up from the side of Sorauren at noon: the\r\nother two brigades kept to the slopes on the west of the river, turning\r\neach position which Clausel took up[981]. By one o’clock he was back\r\nto Etulain, by dusk at Olague, where he was joined by Conroux and the\r\n3,000 men who represented the wreck of his division. Vandermaesen\r\nhad been much mauled--and had left behind 300 prisoners, while many\r\nstragglers from his division, and more from both of the brigades of\r\nConroux, were loose in the hills. It is doubtful whether Clausel had\r\nmore than 8,000 men out of his original 17,000 in hand that evening.\r\nThe survivors were not fit for further fighting[982].\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Reille was undergoing equally unpleasant experiences. He\r\nhad stopped behind to conduct the retreat of Foy’s and Lamartinière’s\r\ndivisions, when the unexpected cannonade, followed by the advance of\r\nthe British infantry, showed that he was not to get away without hard\r\nfighting. When Pakenham attacked Sorauren, and Cole a little later\r\ncrossed the ravine to assail Foy’s position, Reille tried for some\r\ntime to maintain himself on the heights, but soon saw that it was\r\nimpossible. He sent Maucune permission to evacuate Sorauren--of which\r\nthe latter could not avail himself, for he was pressed on all sides\r\nand no longer a free agent. And having thus endeavoured to divest\r\nhimself of responsibility for the fate of his right division, he gave\r\norders for the retreat of the two others not by any regular route, but\r\nstraight across country, up hill and down dale. The reason for haste\r\nwas not only that Cole was now pressing hard upon Foy’s new position,\r\nbut that Picton was visible marching hard for Zabaldica, with the\r\nobvious intention of turning Lamartinière’s flank. There was an ominous\r\nwant of any frontal attack on this division--it was clear that Picton\r\nintended to encircle it, while Foy on the other flank was being driven\r\nin by Cole, and there was a chance of the whole wing being surrounded.\r\nAccordingly, at about 10 o’clock by Lamartinière’s reckoning, he began\r\nto give way in échelon of brigades, much hindered after a time by\r\nPicton’s light troops, who had now swerved up into the hills after\r\nhim, and pestered each battalion when it turned to retreat[983]. Foy\r\nreports that his rear brigade and part of his colleague’s division were\r\nat one moment nearly cut off, and that he ran some danger of being\r\ntaken prisoner. It evidently became a helter-skelter business to get\r\naway, and the French can have made no serious resistance, as Picton’s\r\nthree brigades that day had only just 110 casualties between them[984].\r\nThe retreat was made more disorderly by the arrival of a drove of some\r\n4,000 fugitives of Conroux’s and Maucune’s divisions, accompanied\r\nby the latter general himself, who had escaped over the hills from\r\nSorauren, and ran in for shelter on Foy’s rear.\r\n\r\nAt about one o’clock Reille’s divisions, having outdistanced their\r\npursuers by their rapidity, halted in considerable disarray in a valley\r\nby the village of Esain[985], where Reille tried to restore order,\r\nand to settle a practicable itinerary, with the object of rejoining\r\nClausel. For reasons which he does not specify, he marched himself by\r\na road down the valley, which would lead him to Olague, but told Foy\r\nto take a parallel track farther up the slope which should take him\r\nto Lanz, higher in the same valley. The partition was obviously made\r\nin a very haphazard fashion, for while the bulk of Lamartinière’s\r\ndivision, and the poor remnant of Maucune’s which preserved any order,\r\naccompanied the corps-commander, Foy found that he was being followed\r\nby two stray battalions of Gauthier’s brigade of Lamartinière, and by\r\na great mass of stragglers, largely Conroux’s men, but partly also\r\nMaucune’s and Lamartinière’s.\r\n\r\nReille got to Olague at dusk and joined Clausel, but brought with\r\nhim a mere wreck of his corps, probably not 6,000 men. For Foy never\r\nappeared--and never was to appear again during the campaign. He\r\nexplained, not in the most satisfactory way, that part of his track\r\nlay through woods, where the sense of direction is lost, that he\r\nwas worried by the reappearance of British light troops, who had\r\nto be driven off repeatedly, and that the stragglers smothered his\r\nmarching columns and led them astray. Anyhow, he found himself at\r\ndusk at Iragui in the upper valley of the Arga, instead of at Lanz\r\nin the upper valley of the Ulzama--having marched ten miles instead\r\nof the five that would have taken him from Esain to Lanz. Picton’s\r\nlight troops were still in touch with him, and he resolved that it\r\nwas hopeless to try to struggle over mountains in the dark. Dropping\r\ninto the pass that leads from Zubiri to the Alduides (the Puerto de\r\nUrtiaga), he marched for some hours more, bivouacked, and next morning\r\ndescended into French territory[986]. He sent off the stragglers\r\nto St. Jean-Pied-de-Port--they sacked all the mountain villages on\r\ntheir way[987]--and took his own division at leisure down the Val de\r\nBaigorry to Cambo--having lost only 550 men out of his 6,000 in the\r\nwhole campaign. Some critics whispered that, seeing disaster behind\r\nhim, _il a su trop bien tirer son épingle du jeu_, and had saved his\r\ndivision, regardless of what might happen to colleagues--just as on\r\nthe eve of Vittoria he had refused to join Jourdan, and had managed a\r\nsafe retreat for himself. That it was not absolutely impossible to get\r\naway to the Bastan was shown by the fact that the two stray battalions\r\nof Lamartinière’s division which had followed Foy in error, branched\r\noff from him at Iragui and got to Almandoz, Elizondo, and the pass of\r\nMaya. Another lost party--the battalion and cavalry regiment which\r\nLamartinière had left to cover the Roncesvalles road[988]--turned\r\noff at Zubiri and followed Foy’s route by the Alduides and Baigorry.\r\nReille’s ‘main body’ was a poor remnant by the night of the 30th, after\r\nall these deductions had come to pass.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the operations of Pakenham, Dalhousie,\r\nCole, and Picton during the morning of the 30th were left to the\r\npersonal initiative of these officers. Wellington’s orders for the\r\nfirst move had been made on the spur of the moment, as the position of\r\nthe French became visible at dawn. But after the capture of Sorauren,\r\nprobably between 9 and 10 a.m., he issued a definite programme for the\r\nremainder of the day’s operations.\r\n\r\nPicton was to pursue the enemy who had gone off north-eastward\r\n(Lamartinière) toward the Roncesvalles road. He was given two squadrons\r\nof hussars, and told to take his divisional battery with him.\r\n\r\nCole was to act on the _massif_ between the Arga and the Ulzama,\r\nkeeping touch with Picton on one flank and Pakenham on the other: if\r\nthe enemy in his front (Foy and the wrecks of Maucune) made a strong\r\nstand, he was not to lose men by violent frontal attacks, but to wait\r\nfor the effect of Picton’s turning movement, ‘which will alarm the\r\nenemy for his flank.’\r\n\r\nUp the main road Ostiz-Olague there were to march Byng’s brigade, the\r\n6th Division, and O’Donnell’s troops from the San Cristobal position\r\n(some six battalions). The 6th Division was to take its divisional\r\nbattery with it.\r\n\r\nDalhousie should operate on the east bank of the Ulzama, keeping touch\r\nwith Byng and Pakenham--he would be in a position to turn all positions\r\nwhich the French (Taupin and Vandermaesen) might take up, if they tried\r\nto hold back the main column on the high road. Like Cole, he was not to\r\nattempt anything costly or hazardous.\r\n\r\nFinally, and here later news caused a complete alteration of the\r\nprogramme, Hill was to ‘point a movement’ from Lizaso on Olague and\r\nLanz, if the situation of the enemy made it possible. Attacked himself\r\nby the superior numbers of D’Erlon’s corps, Hill was (of course) unable\r\nto do anything of the kind. Wellington seems to have suspected that he\r\nmight be too weak for his task, and in the general rearrangement of the\r\narmy sent him not only Campbell’s Portuguese brigade (which properly\r\nbelonged to the division of Silveira, who was in person with Hill but\r\nonly with one brigade, Da Costa’s), but also the Spanish battalions\r\nwhich O’Donnell had detached to Ollocarizqueta on the 27th[989], and\r\nfinally Morillo’s division. These 7,000 men were started from their\r\npositions before noon, but did not arrive in time to help Hill[990].\r\nA separate supplementary order went off to Charles Alten to tell him\r\nthat the Light Division would not be wanted at Lecumberri, and should\r\nreturn to Zubieta.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this series of orders is purely offensive in character,\r\nand, as is easily seen, presupposes first, that a large section of the\r\nFrench army is retiring on the Roncesvalles road, but secondly that the\r\nmain body is about to go back by Lanz, the Col de Velate, Elizondo, and\r\nMaya. Hence the heaviness of the column directed on the _chaussée_: if\r\nWellington had dreamed that Soult was intending to send nothing back by\r\nthe Roncesvalles road, and had started a vigorous attack on Hill that\r\nmorning, the orders given would have been different.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during the hours which saw the destruction of Clausel’s and\r\nReille’s divisions, Soult himself was urging on D’Erlon’s corps to\r\noverwhelm Hill, and hoping for the early arrival of Clausel’s to lend\r\nassistance. Reille he had left behind as a containing force, and did\r\nnot expect to see for another twenty-four hours. Soult informs us that\r\nhe left Zabaldica and the left wing so early that he had no reason to\r\nexpect the trouble which was about to break out behind him. He noticed\r\nMaucune’s division beginning to file into Sorauren, and passed Clausel\r\nin march on Ostiz, before the British guns opened, i.e. before 6\r\no’clock in the morning. But they must have been sounding up the valley\r\nbefore he reached D’Erlon on the heights by Etulain: he resolved to\r\npay no attention to the ominous noise, being entirely absorbed in the\r\noperation which he had in hand.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon was already in movement, by the valley of the Ulzama, and had\r\njust been joined by the cavalry, which had come up from the Arga valley\r\nby cross roads in the rear[991]. It was, of course, no use to him in\r\nthe sort of engagement on which he was launched. The Marshal instructed\r\nhim to push on and hurry matters, as there were reports from deserters\r\nthat three hostile divisions were on their way to reinforce the British\r\nforce at Lizaso. Accordingly D’Erlon, having discovered his enemy’s\r\nposition with some little difficulty, for it lay all along the edge of\r\nwoods, delivered his attack as soon as his troops were up. Hill, on\r\nnews of the French advance reaching him, had evacuated Lizaso, which\r\nlies in a hole, and had drawn up his four brigades along a wooded ridge\r\nhalf a mile to the south, with the village of Gorron in front of his\r\nleft wing, and that of Arostegui behind his right wing. The Portuguese\r\nbrigade of Ashworth formed his centre: on the right was one regiment of\r\nDa Costa’s brigade which had been called up from the Marcalain road,\r\non the left the other and the remains of Cameron’s brigade, which had\r\nsuffered so heavily at Maya: Fitzgerald of the 5/60th was in command,\r\nthe brigadier having been wounded on the 25th. Pringle’s brigade (under\r\nO’Callaghan that day, for Pringle was acting as division-commander vice\r\nWilliam Stewart wounded at Maya) was in reserve--apparently distributed\r\nby battalions along the rear of the line. The edge of the woods was\r\nlined with a heavy skirmishing line of light companies, and the Caçador\r\nbattalion of Ashworth’s brigade. Altogether there were under 9,000 men\r\nin line.\r\n\r\nD’Erlon determined to demonstrate against Hill’s front with Darmagnac’s\r\ndivision, who were to hold the Portuguese closely engaged, but not to\r\nattack seriously. Meanwhile Abbé was to assail the Allied left, and\r\nalso to turn it by climbing the high hills beyond its extreme flank, in\r\nthe direction of the village of Beunza. He had ample force to do this,\r\nhaving the strongest division in Soult’s army--8,000 bayonets--and the\r\nonly one which had not yet been seriously engaged during the campaign.\r\nMaransin followed Abbé in support. The arrangements being scientific,\r\nand the force put in action more than double Hill’s, success seemed\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nIt was secured; but not so easily as D’Erlon had hoped. Darmagnac, so\r\nSoult says, engaged himself much more deeply than had been intended.\r\nFinding only Portuguese in his front, he made a fierce attempt to break\r\nthrough, and was handsomely repulsed. Meanwhile Abbé, groping among\r\nthe wooded slopes to find the flank of Fitzgerald’s brigade, missed it\r\nat first, and attacking the 50th and 92nd frontally, saw his leading\r\nbattalions thrown back. But he put in more, farther out to the right,\r\nand though the British brigade threw back its flank _en potence_, and\r\ntried to hold on, it was completely turned, and would have been cut\r\noff, but for a fierce charge by the 34th, who came up from the reserve\r\nand held the enemy in check long enough for the rest to retire--with\r\nthe loss of only 36 prisoners (two of them officers). The retreat of\r\nthe left wing compelled the Portuguese in the centre to give back\r\nalso--they had to make their way across a valley and stream closely\r\npursued, but behaved most steadily, and lost less than might have been\r\nexpected--though some 130 were cut off and captured. The right wing\r\npivoted, in its withdrawal, on an isolated hill held by Da Costa’s 2nd\r\nLine, which was gallantly maintained to the end of the day. The centre\r\nand left lost more than a mile of ground, but were in good enough order\r\nto take up a new position, selected by Hill on a height in front of\r\nthe village of Yguaras, where they repulsed with loss a final attack\r\nmade by one of Darmagnac’s regiments which pursued too fiercely[992].\r\nD’Erlon was re-forming his troops, much scattered in the woods,\r\nwhen at 4 p.m. there arrived from Marcalain the head of Campbell’s\r\nPortuguese brigade, followed by Morillo’s and O’Donnell’s Spaniards.\r\nTheir approach was observed, and no further attacks were made by the\r\nFrench. D’Erlon winds up his account of the day by observing, quite\r\ncorrectly, that he had driven Hill out of his position, inflicted much\r\nloss on him, and got possession of the road to Yrurzun. So he had--the\r\nAllies had lost 156 British and about 900 Portuguese, of whom 170 were\r\nprisoners. The French casualties must have been about 800 in all,\r\nif we may make a rough calculation from the fact that they lost 39\r\nofficers--10 in Abbé’s division, 29 in Darmagnac’s[993].\r\n\r\nBut it is not to win results such as these that 18,000 men attack\r\n8,000, and fight them for seven hours[994]. And what was the use of\r\nsuch a tactical success, when meanwhile Soult’s main body had been\r\nbeaten and scattered to the winds, so that Reille and Clausel were\r\nbringing up 14,000 demoralized soldiers, instead of 30,000 confident\r\nones, to join the victorious D’Erlon?\r\n\r\nThis unpleasant fact stared Soult in the face, when he rode back to\r\nOlague to receive the reports of his two lieutenants. It was useless to\r\nthink of further attempts on the Tolosa road, or molestation of Graham.\r\nD’Erlon’s three divisions were now his only intact force, capable of\r\nengaging in an action with confidence: the rest were not only reduced\r\nto a wreck in number, but were ‘spent troops’ from the point of view of\r\nmorale. The only thing to be done was to retreat as fast as possible,\r\nusing the one solid body of combatants to cover the retreat of the\r\nrest. All that Soult afterwards wrote to Paris about his movements of\r\nJuly 31 being the logical continuation of his design of July 30--‘de\r\nme rapprocher de la frontière pour y prendre des subsistances, avec\r\nl’espoir de joindre la réserve du Général Villatte[995],’ was of course\r\nmere insincerity. He changed his whole plan, and fled in haste, merely\r\nbecause he was forced to do so.\r\n\r\nOne strange resolve, however, he made on the evening of July 30. The\r\nsafest and shortest way home was by the Puerto de Velate, Elizondo, and\r\nMaya; and Clausel’s and Reille’s troops at Olague and Lanz were well\r\nplaced for taking this route. This was not the case with D’Erlon’s men\r\nat Lizaso and the newly won villages in front of it. Instead of bidding\r\nthe routed corps hurry straight on, and bringing D’Erlon down to cover\r\nthem, the Marshal directed Reille and Clausel to leave the great road,\r\nto cut across by Olague to Lizaso, and to get behind D’Erlon, who would\r\nhold on till they were past his rear. All would then take the route\r\nof the Puerto de Arraiz and go by Santesteban. This was a much more\r\ndangerous line of retreat; so much so that the choice excites surprise.\r\nSoult told Clarke that his reason for taking the risk was that D’Erlon\r\nhad got so far west that there was no time to move him back to the\r\nVelate road--which seems an unconvincing argument. For Clausel and\r\nReille had to transfer themselves to the Puerto de Arraiz road, which\r\nwould take just as much time; and D’Erlon could not retreat till they\r\nhad cleared his rear. The real explanation would seem to be that Soult\r\nthought that the British column on the Velate road, being victorious,\r\nwould start sooner and pursue more vigorously than Hill’s troops, who\r\nhad just been defeated. If Reille and Clausel were pressed without\r\ndelay, their divisions would go to pieces: D’Erlon, on the other hand,\r\ncould be relied upon to stand his ground as long as was needful. If\r\nthis was Soult’s idea, his prescience was justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXXVIII: CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOULT’S RETREAT, JULY 31-AUG. 3\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Soult’s orders of the evening of July 29th had been issued,\r\nthere was no longer any pretence kept up that the Army was executing\r\na voluntary strategical movement, _planmässig_ as the German of 1918\r\nwould have expressed the idea, and not absconding under pressure of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAt 1 o’clock midnight Clausel’s and Reille’s harassed troops at Olague\r\nand Lanz went off as fast as their tired legs would carry them, and\r\nleaving countless stragglers behind. D’Erlon could not retire till the\r\nmorning, when he sent off Darmagnac and Maransin to follow the rest of\r\nthe army, retaining Abbé’s division as his rearguard, which held the\r\nheights north of Lizaso for some time after their comrades had gone.\r\n\r\nWellington’s orders issued at nightfall[996] were such as suited Soult\r\nfairly well, for the British general had not foreseen that which was\r\nunlikely, and he had been deceived to some extent by the reports which\r\nhad come in. The deductions which he drew from what he had ascertained\r\nwere that a large body of the enemy had retreated eastward, and would\r\nfall into the Roncesvalles road, but that the main force would follow\r\nthe Velate-Elizondo _chaussée_. That Soult would lead all that survived\r\nto him of his army over the Puerto de Arraiz passes, to Santesteban,\r\nhad not struck him as a likely contingency. Hence his detailed\r\norders overnight were inappropriate to the facts which appeared next\r\nmorning. He directed Picton to pursue whatever was before him on the\r\nRoncesvalles road--thinking that Foy and Lamartinière would escape in\r\nthat direction; but lest they should have gone off by Eugui and the Col\r\nde Urtiaga he directed Pakenham to take the 6th Division from Olague,\r\nwhen it should have reached that place, across the hills to Eugui, from\r\nwhence he could join Picton if necessary. Campbell’s Portuguese were\r\nto turn off in the same direction and make for Eugui and the Alduides.\r\nUnfortunately, Picton was thus set to pursue nothing, while Pakenham\r\nwas twelve hours behind Foy, and never likely to catch him.\r\n\r\nThe main pursuit was to be urged on the _chaussée_ leading by Olague\r\nand Lanz to Elizondo, whither it was supposed that Soult would have\r\ntaken the bulk of his army. From Ostiz and the neighbourhood Byng and\r\nCole were to march in this direction, conducted by Wellington himself,\r\nwhile from the other side Hill was to lead thither his own four\r\nbrigades, and the Spanish reinforcements which had reached him at the\r\nend of the combat of Beunza.\r\n\r\nOnly Dalhousie and the 7th Division were directed to take the route of\r\nthe Puerto de Arraiz, and this not with the object of pursuing the main\r\nFrench army, but rather as a flanking movement to favour the operation\r\nallotted to Hill. And Dalhousie, unfortunately, was not well placed for\r\nthe march allotted to him, since he was near Ostiz, and had to get to\r\nhis destination by a cross march via Lizaso.\r\n\r\nA separate note for Charles Alten, written at the same time as the rest\r\nof the orders, but not sent out till the following morning, directed\r\nthe Light Division to march back to Zubieta where it would be able to\r\ncommunicate with the column that went by the Puerto de Arraiz, i.e.\r\nthat of Dalhousie[997], and be well placed for flank operations against\r\nthe retreating enemy.\r\n\r\nThe net result of all this was to send over half the available\r\ntroops--Picton, Pakenham, Campbell, Byng, and Cole--on roads where\r\nno enemy would be found. And Hill’s force would have suffered the\r\nsame fate, if it had not been in such close touch with D’Erlon that\r\nit could not help following, when it enemy’s route became evident.\r\nUnfortunately--as Soult had perhaps calculated--Hill had troops\r\nwhose ranks had been terrible thinned, and who were tired out by an\r\nunsuccessful action fought on the preceding afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe day’s work was unsatisfactory. Picton, of course, found out at\r\nZubiri that everything that had been on the Roncesvalles road--the\r\nsmall detachment already spoken of[998], and a mass of stragglers--had\r\nturned up toward Eugui and the Alduides on the preceding night. And\r\nCole discovered that Foy had passed the Puerto de Urtiaga a whole march\r\nahead of him. Wellington, with the column on the great _chaussée_,\r\npressed rapidly across the Velate and reached Irurita, with the\r\nexasperating result that he discovered that only 500 to 2,000 French\r\nhad passed that way[999]. On the other hand, he had news from the west\r\nthat an immense mass of the enemy had gone by the Puerto de Arraiz,\r\nwith Hill and Dalhousie after them. There were doubts whether the\r\npursuing force was not dangerously small--at any rate, it would have\r\nto be cautious. And it was tiresome that the position of the Light\r\nDivision was still unknown--it might (or might not) have a chance of\r\nfalling on the flank of Soult’s long column, either at Santesteban or\r\nat Sumbilla. Wellington’s own troops had marched far and fast from\r\nOstiz to Irurita, but there was in the evening enough energy left in\r\nByng’s brigade for a short push farther. News came in that a great\r\nconvoy of food from St. Jean de Luz had just reached Elizondo, where\r\nit had halted under the protection of the regiment which D’Erlon had\r\nleft there on the 27th. By a forced march in the evening Byng’s flank\r\ncompanies surprised and captured the whole--a good supply of bread,\r\nbiscuit, and brandy--the escort making off without resistance. The\r\nbrigadier had the heads of the brandy casks stove in, before the weary\r\ntroops could get at them, ‘it was a sight to see the disappointed\r\nsoldiers lying down on their faces and lapping up the liquor with their\r\nhands[1000].’\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, was unimportant. The real interest of the doings\r\nof July 31st lay on the road from Lizaso to the Puerto de Arraiz. Hill,\r\nas was natural, was late in discovering that the whole of the French\r\narmy had passed across his front, since Abbé’s division still lay at\r\neight in the morning in battle-order blocking his way. But having got\r\nthe news of the decisive success won by his chief on the preceding\r\nday, Hill had to attack the hitherto victorious enemy in front of\r\nhim, knowing that the general situation was such that they could not\r\npossibly stand. His advance was not made till 10 a.m.--a sufficient\r\nproof of the difficulty of resuming the offensive with tired and beaten\r\ntroops. When once, however, it began, the 2nd Division showed that if\r\nits numbers were wasted, its fighting power was still strong. And the\r\ndelay in its attack allowed of the arrival of the 7th Division, who\r\nwere able to co-operate in a way that would have been impossible if the\r\nfighting had started at daybreak.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the hours between dawn and 10 a.m., during which\r\nhis retreat was unmolested, were invaluable to Soult, whose army was\r\njammed in the passes in a most dangerous fashion. He had taken the\r\nlead himself, with the two cavalry divisions and the baggage, ordering\r\nReille, whose troops were the most demoralized of all, to follow, with\r\nClausel in his rear--D’Erlon stopping behind as rearguard to hold back\r\nthe enemy. Now cavalry moves slowly in an uphill climb on a narrow\r\nroad; while worn-out mules and pack-horses go much slower still, and\r\nare always breaking down and obstructing the route. The result was a\r\ncomplete block in the defiles: when Reille heard firing commencing in\r\nthe rear, he grew so anxious that he ordered his infantry to push on\r\nanyhow, and thrust their way through the baggage by force[1001]. This\r\nnaturally made matters still worse. Clausel found a better plan: the\r\nPuerto de Arraiz gives its name to what is really not a single path,\r\nbut three parallel ones of various merit, all crossing the same dip in\r\nthe main crest of the Pyrenees within a short distance of each other.\r\nThey come together again on the north side of the watershed near the\r\nvillage of Donna Maria, whence some writers call the whole group ‘the\r\nDonna Maria passes.’ Clausel, leaving the best and most obvious track\r\nto the others, crossed by the most eastern of the three, the Puerto de\r\nArraiz proper, while the cavalry, Reille, and D’Erlon took the western\r\nroute which is locally known as the Puerto de Eradi, and comes down\r\nmore directly on to Santesteban.\r\n\r\nWhen Hill’s attack began to develop from Lizaso, D’Erlon ordered Abbé’s\r\ndivision to give ground, before it was too closely pressed, but halted\r\nit for a stand again, on heights by the Venta de Urroz, six miles\r\nfarther north, at the foot of the passes. Darmagnac and Maransin were\r\nvisible higher up the crest, where they were waiting till the road\r\nshould be clear in front of them. It was now nearly two o’clock, and\r\nDalhousie’s division was nearing the front, and was visible closing\r\ntowards Hill’s right. Undoubtedly the proper game was to await its\r\narrival, and use it to turn Abbé’s flank. But Hill directed his leading\r\ntroops to prevent the enemy from withdrawing, and the vanguard was this\r\nday in charge of the reckless William Stewart, who despite his Maya\r\nwound had come back to his troops, and appeared with his damaged leg\r\nstrapped to his saddle in a roll of cushions. He ordered Fitzgerald’s\r\nbrigade to attack at once frontally: this was really wicked; the three\r\nbattalions had lost nearly half their numbers at Maya, and 150 men more\r\nat Beunza on the preceding afternoon. They were a mere wreck--under\r\n1,000 bayonets: the position opposite them was a steep wooded hill,\r\nheld by the most intact division of the whole French army, over 7,000\r\nstrong. The attack was delivered with great courage, but was hopeless\r\nfrom the first, and repelled with loss[1002]. Stewart then repeated it,\r\nthrowing in Pringle’s brigade as it came up from the rear, to support\r\nFitzgerald’s, and turning on two guns, which had been brought up with\r\nmuch difficulty, to shell the woods beside the road. A second attack\r\nwas thus delivered with equal want of success. But Dalhousie’s troops\r\nhaving now come up on the right[1003], a third push was successful,\r\nand Abbé went back, and retired behind Darmagnac, who now took over\r\nthe rearguard. The hours gained in this combat had sufficed to clear\r\nthe road, and on the further advance of the British, D’Erlon’s corps\r\ngave back rapidly but in good order, and was in full retreat down the\r\nnorthern watershed when a dense fog came on, and caused Hill to halt\r\nhis troops. Stewart’s first wholly unnecessary frontal attack had\r\nresulted in the loss of the acting-brigadier, Fitzgerald, wounded and\r\na prisoner[1004], and of nearly 200 casualties among his three weak\r\nbattalions--91 in the 92nd Highlanders alone, who having put 750 men\r\nin line at Maya on the 25th came out of action on the 31st with only\r\n250 surviving. The 7th Division had 117 casualties distributed between\r\nsix English and Portuguese units--and the total loss in the combat was\r\n387, including a score of prisoners. That Stewart himself was again\r\nwounded and sent to the rear, after only twelve hours at the front, was\r\na testimonial to his courage, but a very fortunate event for the 2nd\r\nDivision. The French cannot have lost much over 200 men[1005].\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared the passes, Hill thought it was his duty to carry\r\nout Wellington’s original orders of the preceding night[1006], by\r\nclosing in towards the main body on the Maya _chaussée_; he did so by\r\ntaking a hill track called the Puerto de Sangre, which runs from Arraiz\r\nto Almandoz. Of course this was a grave mistake, as troops were wanted\r\nrather on the Santesteban than on the Elizondo road. Hill must not\r\nbe too much blamed, as Wellington might have sent him new orders to\r\nkeep to the direction of the enemy’s retreat, and did not. The danger\r\ninvolved in this move was that only the 7th Division was left to pursue\r\nSoult’s main body, and the force in the upper Bastan was unnecessarily\r\nincreased. The responsibility rests with Wellington, who, even after\r\nreaching Irurita in the afternoon and finding practically no traces of\r\nenemy in the Bastan, could not believe that the French had gone off _en\r\nmasse_ by the passes to Santesteban. He would make no sweeping changes\r\nin his plan till he got full information. ‘I shall make the troops\r\ndine, and see what is to be done in the evening’ was his message to\r\nMurray[1007]. The evening brought Hill’s news, and by dawn Wellington\r\nwas much more clear about the situation--‘as far as I can judge the\r\nenemy have six divisions between Doña Maria and St. Estevan. There are\r\nthree divisions certainly about Eugui and Roncesvalles[1008].’ The\r\ndistribution of the French was even still misjudged--there were troops\r\nrepresenting eight divisions, not six, in the Central Bastan valley.\r\nAnd only one division, Foy’s, had passed eastward; though so many lost\r\ndetachments and bands of stragglers had followed it, that an impression\r\nof much larger numbers had been produced.\r\n\r\nDespite of Wellington’s misconceptions, Soult’s position at Santesteban\r\nthat evening was most uncomfortable. His cavalry scouts had brought\r\nhim news that there was a heavy British column on his right flank, at\r\nElizondo in the Upper Bastan (Cole and Byng). His rearguard had been\r\nfiercely attacked by another column (Dalhousie and Hill). There were\r\nlarge possibilities of the arrival of other foes from the north and\r\nwest, if Graham had not been kept employed by Villatte. And it was\r\ngrowing most obvious that the story which D’Erlon had reported, to\r\nthe effect that the Reserve Division had crossed the Bidassoa, and\r\nwas advancing, could not be true. For cavalry patrols pushing down\r\nthe river towards Vera could not find any signs of friendly troops,\r\nand had been fired on by Spanish outposts--Longa’s men. When Soult\r\nnext wrote to Paris he spoke out with much bitterness on the criminal\r\ntorpidity of Villatte, who might at least, without risking anything,\r\nhave occupied Vera and the gorge of the Bidassoa, and have tried to\r\nget into touch with the army in the field. It must be remembered that\r\ndown to the 30th all Soult’s communications with his bases at Bayonne\r\nand St. Jean-Pied-du-Port had been either by Maya or by Roncesvalles.\r\nHe had thrown up the latter line when he marched north; the former was\r\nnow closed to him by the reported arrival of a large hostile force\r\nat Elizondo. The only way home was by the road down the Bidassoa by\r\nSumbilla to Echalar; and now it turned out that there was no certainty\r\nthat this road might not have been blocked by detachments from\r\nGraham’s army. The situation was anything but hopeful, and a complete\r\ndisaster was by no means outside the bounds of possibility. One thing\r\nwas certain--the army must get out of the Santesteban cul-de-sac\r\nas soon as possible, and by the only road that was not known to be\r\nintercepted. But prompt flight was rendered difficult by the presence\r\nat head-quarters of two divisions of quite useless cavalry, a convoy of\r\nmany thousands of wounded, and the baggage of eight divisions.\r\n\r\nAt evening on the 31st the Marshal had been so much disturbed by the\r\nnews of the presence of the British at Elizondo, from whence they could\r\ndescend on Santesteban by following the road along the Bidassoa, that\r\nhe had thrown out the whole of Reille’s surviving infantry (perhaps\r\n6,000 men) to cover the road by the river against any attack. But the\r\nenemy did not move that night--Wellington was resting his men and\r\nwaiting for news. Dalhousie had halted on the heights by the Puerto de\r\nArraiz when the fog came down at 5 p.m., and did not follow D’Erlon\r\ndown to the valley.\r\n\r\nHence Soult had the power to arrange for a flitting before dawn, on\r\nthe only possible route--a gorge twelve miles long where the road\r\nfollows the rocky bed of the Bidassoa in all its curves, with the water\r\non its left and steep wooded hills on its right. The line of march\r\nwas headed by one infantry battalion of Reille’s corps to clear the\r\nway[1009], then came Treillard’s dragoons[1010], six regiments, taking\r\nup an intolerable length of road, then the remains of Lamartinière’s\r\ndivision[1011], then the wounded followed by the baggage train, then\r\nthe handful of men that represented the wrecked division of Maucune,\r\nthen (apparently) Pierre Soult’s cavalry[1012]. D’Erlon’s corps was to\r\nfollow--in the order Abbé, Maransin, Darmagnac, followed by another\r\nmass of baggage. Clausel’s wing was directed to bring up the rear,\r\nwith the task of holding back any pursuit either from the direction of\r\nElizondo or that of the Donna Maria passes. It was certain that there\r\nwas danger from both sides--so the start was made early--at 2.30, long\r\nere dawn. Reille was directed to lead the column along the river as\r\nfar as the bifurcation of the routes to Vera and to Echalar, where he\r\nwas to take the latter, and turn off from the Bidassoa: for the last\r\nstage into France was to be made over the Puerto de Echalar and not\r\nover the more westerly Puerto de Vera. Apparently D’Erlon was ordered\r\nto branch off at Sumbilla with his infantry alone, and to take a\r\nseparate mountain-track to Echalar, which few maps mark. This is, at\r\nany rate, Soult’s statement; but as D’Erlon makes no mention of such\r\ndirections, and did not actually go that way (though Clausel did), the\r\norder matters little to the historian.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant possibilities of the situation of the French on the\r\nnight of July 31st-August 1st seem to have been more clearly discerned\r\nby Soult than by Wellington--as was natural, since the Marshal knew\r\nmuch better the exact state of his own army. There was a positive\r\ndanger that it might be enveloped from all sides on the following\r\nday. But Wellington does not seem to have contemplated so great an\r\noperation, though he had a clear notion that the enemy might be much\r\nincommoded and harassed if all went well. He had hopes that something\r\nmight be done by means of the Light Division--whose position was still,\r\nmost unluckily, a matter of doubt. He had written on the preceding\r\nafternoon to Charles Alten to say that if he had got back to Zubieta,\r\nhe ought to be told that a large body of the enemy was marching by the\r\nDonna Maria passes: ‘it is very desirable that you should endeavour\r\nto head them at St. Estevan. If you should find that you cannot head\r\nthem there, you might at Sumbilla, or you might cut in upon their\r\ncolumn of march: they are in the greatest disorder. The head of our\r\ntroops is here at Irurita, and others are following the enemy by Doña\r\nMaria. Communicate this to Sir Thomas Graham, via Goizueta[1013].’ It\r\nis quite clear that there is no idea of encirclement in this order,\r\nbut only one of molestation. And it is equally obvious that Wellington\r\nhad no idea of using any of Graham’s forces to block the gorge of the\r\nBidassoa. His message to that general on the 31st is, ‘we are going to\r\nact immediately against a column which is retiring by the Doña Maria\r\nroad. We have plenty of troops in the proper direction, and if we can\r\novertake the column, I hope its rear will suffer considerably[1014].’\r\nGraham is asked for no help; and, what is more curious, Wellington in\r\nhis last preceding letter had told him that he attached no importance\r\nto keeping possession of Vera, at the actual gorge of the Bidassoa.\r\n‘I have a letter from General Giron, expressing apprehensions of the\r\nconsequences to his position of losing Vera. The fact is, that Vera is\r\nno object to anybody. The heights are important for the communication\r\nwith Lesaca by the valley of the Bidassoa, and the heights on the other\r\nside open the _débouché_ into France. But the loss of both would not\r\naffect the position of Irun, if the passages through the rocky heights\r\non the right of Irun are well guarded, for which Longa is allotted:\r\nand that is what it is most important to take care of.’[1015] This, it\r\nis true, was written on the 30th, before Wellington had ascertained\r\nthat any French force was to retire by Santesteban. But it coincides\r\ncompletely with Graham’s contemporary letter to his commander,\r\nexpressing exactly the same opinion. ‘General Giron seems anxious, on\r\nhearing of Soult’s being repulsed, to undertake an offensive operation\r\nagainst the Puerto de Vera, which I could not encourage, being\r\npersuaded that his troops would not succeed, against so strong a post,\r\nand that his failure would be very prejudicial.’\r\n\r\nIn fact it is clear that Graham and Wellington both discouraged the\r\nidea of sending a considerable force to the gorge of the Bidassoa,\r\nwhich a day later would have proved of incalculable importance. A\r\nsingle division placed on the cross-roads to Vera and Echalar by the\r\nbridge of Yanzi would have cut Soult’s only line of retreat. His\r\ninfantry, no doubt, or great part of it, could have escaped over the\r\nmountains, but the whole of his cavalry and train, and no doubt many\r\ninfantry also, must have been captured. To make matters easy for\r\nthe enemy, Soult had placed at the head of his interminable column\r\nuseless dragoons, and the smallest and most demoralized of his corps\r\nof infantry. Neither Reille’s wasted divisions nor Treillard’s cavalry\r\ncould have cut their way through 5,000 steady troops at the mouth of\r\nthe defile. And D’Erlon could not have got up--the road in front of him\r\nfor miles being blocked with baggage and helpless horsemen, and his\r\nrear harassed by vigorous pursuit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, when Longa complained that he was too weak on\r\nthe heights opposite Vera, and reported that the French were turning\r\nback, and that his post at the bridge of Yanzi would be attacked,\r\nno more was done to strengthen him than the moving of one brigade\r\nof Barcena’s division to the heights by Lesaca, from which a single\r\nbattalion was sent down to the Yanzi position. Yet this solitary unit\r\nhad no small effect on the events of August 1, caused a panic among the\r\nenemy, and delayed Soult’s march for hours. What would have happened if\r\nGraham and Giron had sent down a solid force (e.g. one British and one\r\nor two Spanish brigades) it is impossible to say with accuracy, but the\r\nresults must have been tremendous.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the legend according to which Wellington\r\nschemed for the complete encirclement of Soult’s army on the 1st of\r\nAugust, though early and well supported, is inaccurate. The form which\r\nit takes in Napier[1016], Larpent, and Stanhope’s _Conversations\r\nwith the Duke of Wellington_, is that on the evening of the 31st\r\narrangements were being made for a concentric attack on Soult, but\r\nthat they were foiled, under Wellington’s own eyes, by a party of\r\nmarauding British soldiers, who strayed near the French camp, and were\r\ntaken prisoners. Their appearance from the Elizondo side betrayed,\r\nit is alleged, to Soult that he was outflanked, and caused him to\r\nmarch in the night instead of at dawn--by which time he would have\r\nbeen surrounded. Unfortunately for the legend, we have Soult’s own\r\ncontemporary dispatch of August 2 to prove that the news of the\r\npresence of the British at Elizondo was brought him by a cavalry\r\npatrol, which reached the village just as it and the convoy in it were\r\ncaptured by Byng’s brigade. They got away, but could not tell him\r\nwhether the convoy-escort had, or had not, escaped. Moreover, much\r\nearlier in the day, Reille had warned the Marshal that the British were\r\ncoming up in force on the Velate-Elizondo road--so the whole story\r\nfalls through.\r\n\r\nWellington’s limited ambitions of August 1 are made clear by his\r\ndispatch written at 6 in the morning, which says that he is sending\r\nthe 4th Division on to Santesteban ‘with the intention of aiding\r\nDalhousie’s advance, and to endeavour to cut some of them off.’ It\r\nis true that he adds, ‘I sent in triplicate to the Light Division at\r\nZubieta yesterday, to desire that General Alten should move toward St.\r\nEstevan, and at all events get hold of Sumbilla if he could. But I have\r\nheard nothing of him[1017].’ He was therefore not relying on certain\r\nhelp from the Light Division, or from Graham or from Longa, though\r\nadvices of the situation were sent to all three. Of the troops under\r\nhis own hand he only sent the 4th Division to join the hunt. Cole was\r\ndirected to push the French on the north bank of the Bidassoa, while\r\nDalhousie was pressing them on the south bank. Byng was told to remain\r\nstationary, till Hill’s column should come up from Almandoz, ‘when I\r\nshall know better how things are situated on all sides, and how far Sir\r\nRowland has advanced.’\r\n\r\nThe 4th Division, starting early despite of its long march on the\r\npreceding day, was attacking the French rear by seven o’clock in the\r\nmorning--7th Division diaries would seem to show that Dalhousie was\r\nmuch later in closing. We have, oddly enough, no good account of\r\nthe fight that ensued from any British source[1018]; but Clausel’s\r\nnarrative enables us to understand pretty well what happened. At\r\ndawn Vandermaesen’s division had been left as rearguard on the hill\r\nfacing Santesteban on the north side of the Bidassoa, with Taupin’s\r\nin support, while Conroux’s was trying to make its way towards\r\nSumbilla, but found the path blocked by D’Erlon’s baggage in front.\r\nWherefore Clausel directed his brigadiers to give up any idea of\r\nkeeping to the road, and to march along the slopes above it, so long\r\nas was possible. When the British appeared, they attacked with long\r\nlines of skirmishers, keeping to the hillside and attempting to turn\r\nVandermaesen’s flank on the high ground. The French, therefore, also\r\nextended themselves uphill, but reached the crest only after the enemy\r\nhad just crowned it. ‘On this ground, where no regular deployment\r\ncould take place, the side which had got to the top first had every\r\nadvantage.’ Vandermaesen’s battalions evidently broke up, as we are\r\ntold that they got into trouble, ‘continuing a retrograde movement\r\nhigh up the mountain among horrid precipices,’ and were only rallied\r\non two of Taupin’s regiments above the gorge of the defile between\r\nSantesteban and Sumbilla, where Clausel had to halt perforce, because\r\nthere was a complete block in front of him--Darmagnac’s division of\r\nD’Erlon’s corps was halted there from absolute inability to proceed,\r\nowing to trouble in front. The French narrative then describes an\r\nhour of incoherent fighting on the slopes above Sumbilla, in which\r\nDarmagnac’s troops on the road below were also engaged. It ended with\r\nthe retreat of all Clausel’s three divisions across the hills, each\r\ntaking its own way by foot-tracks up a different spur of the Atchiola\r\nrange, and arriving in succession in the upland valley of Echalar by\r\nseparate routes. The British did not follow, but stuck to Darmagnac\r\nand the baggage-train down in the road, whom they continued to press\r\nand persecute. All this reads like a serious fight and a deliberate\r\nretreat--but the critical historian must remark that to all appearances\r\nClausel is glozing over a complete _débandade_ and a disorderly flight\r\nacross the mountains--for that there was no real resistance is shown by\r\nthe casualty list of the pursuing British. The 4th Division brigades,\r\nEnglish and Portuguese, lost that day precisely three men killed and\r\nthree officers and 42 men wounded among their twelve battalions--i.\r\ne. there can have been no attempt at a stand at any time in the\r\nmorning--and from the first moment, when Vandermaesen’s flank was\r\nturned, the enemy must have continued to make off over inaccessible\r\nground as hard as he could go. If he had tried to hold the pursuers\r\nback, the 4th Division would have shown more than 48 killed and\r\nwounded. The 7th Division had no casualties at all, so evidently did\r\nnot get to the front in time to do more than pick up stragglers and\r\nbaggage. The same impression of mere flight is produced by the French\r\nlists of officers killed and hurt--six in Vandermaesen’s division, one\r\nin Conroux’s, none in Taupin’s--this should, on the usual proportion\r\nbetween the ranks, represent perhaps 150 or 160 as the total loss of\r\nClausel’s corps[1019]. Obviously then, we are facing the record of a\r\nflight not of a fight; and the conduct of these same divisions on the\r\nfollowing morning, when attacked by Barnes’s brigade--of which, more in\r\nits proper place--sufficiently explains the happenings of August 1st.\r\n\r\nSo much for the chronicle of the rearguard. That of the vanguard is\r\nmuch more interesting. Reille, as has been before mentioned, was in\r\ncharge of the advance, which consisted of one battalion of the 120th\r\nRegiment, followed by Treillard’s dragoon division, the baggage of\r\nthe corps, and the main convoy of wounded; the rest of the infantry\r\nwas separated by a couple of miles of impedimenta from the leading\r\nbattalion. There was no trouble, though progress was very slow, until,\r\nlate in the morning, the head of the column arrived near the bridge of\r\nYanzi, where a by-path, leading down from that village and from Lesaca,\r\ncrosses the Bidassoa. The bridge of Yanzi was, as has been mentioned\r\nabove--the extreme right point of the long observation line which\r\nLonga’s Spaniards had been holding since July 25th. The village above\r\nit, on the west bank, a mile uphill, was occupied by a battalion of\r\nBarcena’s division of the Galician Army, lent to Longa on the preceding\r\nday--the 2nd Regiment of Asturias[1020]. But there were two companies\r\nof Longa’s own on outlying picket at the bridge, which had been\r\nbarricaded but not broken. The road from Santesteban bifurcates a short\r\ndistance up-stream from the bridge, the left-hand branch following\r\nthe bank of the Bidassoa to Vera, the right-hand one diverging inland\r\nand uphill to Echalar. The route of the French was not across the\r\nbridge, since they were not going to Lesaca or Yanzi, nor past it,\r\nsince they were not going to Vera; they had to turn off eastward at\r\nthe cross-roads, almost opposite the bridge but a little south of it,\r\nand to follow the minor road which leads up to Echalar along the south\r\nbank of the Sari stream, on which that village stands. When Reille’s\r\nbattalion at the head of the marching column came to the cross roads,\r\nit was fired upon by the Spanish post at the bridge. This created some\r\nconfusion: the critic can only ask with wonder why Reille, who had six\r\ncavalry regiments under his orders, had not sent out vedettes along the\r\nroads far ahead, and become aware long before of the obstruction in\r\nhis front: evidently, however, he had not. After the first shots were\r\nfired, there was a general stoppage all down the column. The battalion\r\nat its head could see that the Spaniards were very few, and prepared\r\nto dislodge them. Meanwhile the dragoons had halted and many of them,\r\nat places where the river was level with the road, walked their horses\r\ninto the stream, to let them drink. Suddenly there came a violent\r\nexplosion of musketry from the front--the bridge was being attacked and\r\nforced. But to those far down the road, who could not see the bridge,\r\nit sounded as if the enemy was assailing and driving in the solitary\r\nbattalion on which the safety of the whole army depended for the\r\nmoment. A great part of the dragoons shouted ‘right about turn,’ and\r\ngalloped backward up the pass without having received any order[1021],\r\ntill they plunged into General Reille and his staff, moving at the head\r\nof Lamartinière’s division, and nearly rode them down. The column of\r\ninfantry blocking the road stopped the further progress of the foremost\r\nfugitives, who got jammed in a mass by the impetus of squadrons\r\npressing behind them. Reille could not make out the cause of the\r\npanic, but filed the 2nd Léger out of the road and sent them past the\r\ndragoons by a footpath on the slope, by which they got to the bridge.\r\nIt was found that the Spaniards had been driven from it, and forced\r\nto retire up the west bank of the river, the way to Echalar being\r\nclear. Thereupon the battalion of the 120th, followed by the 2nd Léger,\r\nturned up the road, and after them the leading regiments of dragoons.\r\nThe officers in charge at the front forgot that their enemies might\r\nreturn, and left no one to guard the bridge. Hence, when Reille came\r\nup in person a little later, he was vexed to find that the Spaniards\r\nhad reappeared on the rocky farther bank of the river half a mile above\r\nthe bridge, and were firing across the ravine at the passing cavalry,\r\ncausing much confusion and some loss. Unable to cross the river, which\r\nhad precipitous banks at this point, he ordered that the next infantry\r\nwhich arrived--the 2nd battalion of the 120th--should deploy on the\r\nslopes above the road, and keep down the enemy’s fire by continuous\r\nvolleys. He also directed another battalion to cross the bridge, and\r\nwork up-stream till they should come on the flank of the Spaniards, and\r\nthen to drive them away. This was done, and the rest of the dragoons,\r\nLamartinière’s infantry, and the head of the column of baggage filed\r\npast the cross-roads and went on towards Echalar--with Reille himself\r\nin their company. He had left a battalion at the Yanzi bridge, with\r\norders to hold the pass, but had little expectation of seeing it\r\nmolested again, taking the enemy for a mere party of guerrilleros.\r\n\r\nBut worse was now to come. The Spanish companies which had been driven\r\noff were now reinforced by the main body of the regiment of Asturias,\r\nwhich, coming down from Yanzi village, made a vigorous attack on the\r\nbridge, swept back the French battalion which was holding it[1022],\r\nand began firing into the baggage train which was passing the cross\r\nroads at that moment. The bulk of it turned back in confusion, and\r\nrushed up the defile, soon causing a complete block among the convoy\r\nof wounded and the division of Maucune, which was the next combatant\r\nunit in the line of march. The Spaniards held the bridge for more\r\nthan two hours, during which complete anarchy prevailed on the road as\r\nfar as Sumbilla, where D’Erlon’s rearguard, the division of Darmagnac,\r\nwas now engaged in skirmishing with the British 4th Division. The\r\nreal difficulty was that owing to the bad arrangement of the order\r\nof march, it took an inordinate time to bring fresh troops from the\r\nrear up to the head of the column; while Reille, now safely arrived\r\nat Echalar and busy in arranging his troops in position there, does\r\nnot seem to have thought for a moment of what might be going on behind\r\nhim[1023]. Maucune’s division (a mere wreck) came up at last, thrusting\r\nthe baggage and wounded aside: its general confesses that ‘it fought\r\nfeebly with the Spaniards at the bridge--its loss was not more than 30\r\nmen. The division was so weak, its men so short of cartridges, that\r\nit was necessary to wait for one of Count D’Erlon’s divisions to come\r\nup, before the road could be cleared[1024].’ He does not add--but his\r\ncorps-commander[1025] gives us the fact--that ‘the 7th Division ended\r\nby quitting the road and throwing itself into the mountains in order to\r\navoid the enemy’s fire,’ i. e. it went over the hills in disorder, and\r\narrived at Echalar as a mob rather than a formed body. Abbé’s troops,\r\nat the head of D’Erlon’s column, at last got up, after a desperate\r\nscramble through the mass of baggage, wounded, and (apparently) cavalry\r\nalso, for some of Pierre Soult’s regiments seem to have been marching\r\nafter Maucune. ‘Jammed between the river, whose right bank is very\r\nsteep, and the mountain, whose slopes are wooded and impracticable, the\r\nsoldiers shoved the train aside, upsetting much into the river, and\r\nturning the disorder of the movement to profit by pillaging all that\r\nthey could lay their hands upon[1026].’ At last Abbé got four or five\r\nbattalions disentangled[1027] and formed them to attack the bridge,\r\nwhich was carried by the 64th Regiment after a struggle which did the\r\nAsturians much credit--the French units engaged showed a loss of 9\r\nofficers, probably therefore of some 200 men[1028]. Leaving a couple of\r\nbattalions to guard the bridge and the knoll beyond it, Abbé hurried\r\nthe rest of his division towards Echalar, the baggage following as\r\nit could, mixed with the troops that were coming up from the rear.\r\nThus the greater part of D’Erlon’s corps got through; but there was\r\nstill one more episode to come in this day of alarms and excursions.\r\nDarmagnac’s division, at the rear of all, had reached the cross-roads,\r\nand had relieved Abbé’s battalions at the bridge by a covering force\r\nof its own, when a new and furious fire of musketry suddenly broke out\r\nfrom the slopes above, and a swarm of green-coated skirmishers rushed\r\ndown the heights, carried the knoll and the bridge below it, and opened\r\nfire on the passing troops--Darmagnac’s rear brigade--and the mass of\r\nbaggage which was mixed with it. This marked the arrival--when it was\r\ntoo late--of the much tried British Light Division, whose unfortunate\r\nadventures of the last three days it is necessary to explain.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Wellington had sent orders to Charles Alten,\r\non the 29th July, that he should move from Zubieta to such a point\r\non the Tolosa-Yrurzun road as might seem best--possibly Lecumberri.\r\nThis dispatch travelled fast, and Alten marched that same night to\r\nSaldias--a short stage but fatiguing, as marches in the dark are prone\r\nto be. Next day--the 30th--the Light Division made an extremely long\r\nand exhausting march by vile mountain roads to Lecumberri, hearing\r\nall day incessant cannonading and musketry fire to their left--this\r\nwas the noise of the second battle of Sorauren and the combat of\r\nBeunza. Unfortunately Alten was in touch neither with Hill nor with\r\nHead-Quarters, and though he reached Lecumberri at dark on the 30th,\r\ngot no news of what had happened till late on the afternoon of the\r\n31st, when one of Wellington’s aides-de-camp rode in, ‘more dead than\r\nalive from excessive fatigue[1029],’ bearing the order issued late on\r\nthe 30th for the return of the division to Zubieta. He brought the\r\nnews of Soult’s defeat--but Wellington and every one else had supposed\r\nthat the French would go back by the Puerto de Velate, and Alten’s\r\norders were merely to get into communication with the 7th Division,\r\nsent on the side-operation by the Puerto de Arraiz, which was at the\r\ntime of the issue of the order thought comparatively subsidiary[1030].\r\nThe Light Division marched that evening to Leyza--eight or nine miles\r\non a mountain road--not a bad achievement for the dark hours, but\r\ncritics (wise after the event) whispered that Alten might have got to\r\nSaldias, eight miles farther, if he had chosen to push the men. It, at\r\nany rate, made a mighty difference to the fate of the campaign that\r\nWellington’s next orders, those issued from Almandoz at noon on the\r\n31st, found the Light Division not near Zubieta but at Leyza, when they\r\nwere handed in during the small hours before dawn on the 1st.\r\n\r\nThis dispatch, as will be remembered, told Alten that Soult had retired\r\nby the Puerto de Arraiz and Santesteban, and was obviously going\r\nhome through the gorge of the Bidassoa, by Vera and Echalar. He was\r\ndirected to ‘head off’ the enemy at Santesteban, if that were possible,\r\nif not at Sumbilla seven miles farther north--or at least to ‘cut\r\nin upon their column of march’ somewhere[1031]. All this would have\r\nbeen quite possible, if Wellington had not on the 29th sent the Light\r\nDivision on the unlucky southward march from Zubieta to Lecumberri.\r\nThis misdirection was at the root of all subsequent misadventure. We\r\nmay add that it would still have been possible, if the dispatch sent\r\noff in the early morning of the 31st to bid the division come back to\r\nZubieta, had contained any indication that the enemy was retiring by\r\nSantesteban, or that haste was necessary. But it had only directed\r\nAlten to ‘put his division in movement for Zubieta,’ but to keep up his\r\ntouch with Lecumberri, and told him that Dalhousie would be marching\r\nby the passes of Donna Maria[1032]. The Almandoz note, which contained\r\nthe really important general information and detailed orders, wandered\r\nabout for many hours in the sabretache of an aide-de-camp who could not\r\nknow where Alten was, and found him after many hours of groping in the\r\nnight at Leyza, and not at Zubieta. From the latter place, only six\r\nmiles from Santesteban, the operation directed by Wellington would have\r\nbeen possible to execute in good time--from Leyza (on the other side of\r\na difficult pass, and many miles farther away) it was not. This simple\r\nfact settled the fate of the Light Division on August 1.\r\n\r\nAlten put his men under arms at dawn on that morning, and marched, as\r\nordered, for Santesteban via Zubieta; having passed the latter place\r\nand got to Elgorriaga, four miles farther on, he received the news\r\nthat the enemy had left Santesteban early, and could not be headed off\r\nthere. Wellington’s alternative scheme dictated an attempt to break\r\ninto Soult’s line of march at Sumbilla, so the Light Division was put\r\nin motion by the very bad country road over the mountain of Santa Cruz\r\nfrom Elgorriaga to Aranaz and Yanzi. The men had already gone a full\r\nday’s journey, and were much fatigued. They had (it will be remembered)\r\nexecuted a night march from Lecumberri to Leyza only twelve hours back.\r\nThe Santa Cruz path was heart-breaking--officers had to dismount and\r\nwalk up to spare their horses: the men went bent double under their\r\nknapsacks: the day was one of blazing August sunshine: the track was\r\nover big stones embedded in deep shale--one sufferer compared his\r\nprogress to striding from one stepping-stone to another[1033].\r\n\r\nOn reaching the crest of the Santa Cruz mountain, opposite Sumbilla,\r\nat four in the afternoon, the Light Division at last came in sight of\r\nthe enemy--a dense and disorderly column hurrying along the road from\r\nSumbilla northward, pressed by the 4th Division, the bickering fire\r\nof whose skirmishers could be seen round the tail of the rearguard.\r\nThey were separated from the observer’s point of view by the canon of\r\nthe Bidassoa, here very deep and precipitous--the Santa Cruz mountain\r\nis over 3,000 feet high. It would have taken much time to scramble\r\ndown the steep path to Sumbilla, and the enemy was already past that\r\nvillage. Alten, therefore, resolved to push for the bridge of Yanzi,\r\nseven miles farther on, with the hope of cutting off at least the\r\nrearguard of the French.\r\n\r\nBut this seven miles was too much for men already in the last stages\r\nof fatigue from over-marching and want of food. ‘When the cry was set\r\nup “the enemy,” the worn soldiers raised their bent heads covered with\r\ndust and sweat: we had nearly reached the summit of the tremendous\r\nmountain, but nature was quite exhausted. Many men had lagged behind,\r\nhaving accomplished thirty miles over rocky roads interspersed with\r\nloose stones. Many fell heavily on the naked rock, frothing at the\r\nmouth, black in the face, and struggling in their last agonies. Others,\r\nunable to drag one leg after the other, leaned on the muzzles of their\r\nfirelocks, muttering in disconsolate accents that “they had never\r\nfallen out before”[1034].’\r\n\r\nThis was a heart-breaking sight for the divisional commander, who could\r\nsee both the opportunity still offered him, and the impossibility of\r\ntaking full advantage of it. After a short halt the troops, or such of\r\nthem as could still keep up, were started off again to shuffle down the\r\nshaly track on the north side of the mountain. At the foot of it, by a\r\nbrook near the village of Aranaz, the 2nd Brigade was told to halt and\r\nfall out--it was a trifle more exhausted than the 1st Brigade, because\r\nit had endured more of the dust, and more of the delay from casual\r\nstoppages and accidents, which always happens in the rear of a long\r\ncolumn. Alten carried the survivors--the 1st and 3rd battalions Rifle\r\nBrigade, 1/43rd, and 1st Caçadores--as far as Yanzi, and then turned\r\nthem down the road to the Bidassoa, which is screened by woods. The\r\nFrench were taken wholly by surprise: the Rifle battalions carried the\r\nknoll above the bridge, and the bridge itself, without much difficulty.\r\nThe 43rd and Caçadores spread themselves out on the slope to their\r\nright and opened fire on the hurrying mass below them.\r\n\r\n‘At twilight,’ wrote a captain of the 43rd whose narrative was quoted\r\nby Napier, but is well worth quoting again, ‘we overlooked the enemy\r\nwithin a stone’s throw, and from the summit of a precipice: the river\r\nseparated us: but the French were wedged in a narrow road, with rocks\r\nenclosing them on one side and the river on the other. Such confusion\r\ntook place among them as is impossible to describe. The wounded were\r\nthrown down in the rush and trampled upon: the cavalry drew their\r\nswords and endeavoured to charge up the pass to Echalar[1035], the\r\nonly opening on their right flank. But the infantry beat them back,\r\nand several of them, horse and man, were precipitated into the river.\r\nOthers fired up vertically at us, while the wounded called out for\r\nquarter, and pointed to the numerous soldiers borne on the shoulders\r\nof their comrades on stretchers composed of the branches of trees,\r\nto which were looped great-coats clotted with gore, or blood-stained\r\nsheets taken from houses to carry their wounded--on whom we did not\r\nfire[1036].’\r\n\r\nThe officer commanding in the French rear finally got out a battalion\r\nbehind a stone wall, whose fire somewhat covered the defiling mass.\r\nAll the bolder spirits ran the gauntlet through the zone of fire and\r\nescaped up the road to Echalar[1037]. The weak, the wounded, and the\r\nworn-out surrendered to the leading troops of the 4th Division, who now\r\nclosed in on them. About 1,000 prisoners were made, largely soldiers\r\nof the train and other non-combatants, but including stragglers from\r\nnearly every division in Soult’s army. There was no pursuit--the Light\r\nDivision troops could not have stirred a step: the 4th Division were\r\nalmost as weary after a long day’s hunt. The casualties of both had\r\nbeen absurdly small--3 officers and 45 men in Cole’s regiments, 1\r\nofficer and 15 men in Alten’s. The Spanish battalion engaged in the\r\nafternoon must, of course, have lost on a very different scale during\r\nits highly creditable operations; but its casualties have, unluckily,\r\nnot been recorded. The French may have had 500 killed and wounded, and\r\n1,000 prisoners--but this was the least part of their loss--the really\r\nimportant thing was that thousands of men were scattered in the hills,\r\nand did not rally to their eagles for many days. That night Soult’s\r\narmy was not only a demoralized, but a much depleted force.\r\n\r\nWellington was, not unnaturally, dissatisfied with the day’s work.\r\n‘Many events,’ he wrote to Graham, ‘turned out for us unfortunately\r\non the 1st instant, each of which ought to have been in our favour:\r\nwe should have done the enemy a great deal more mischief than we did\r\nduring his passage down this valley[1038].’ For one of these things,\r\nAlten’s late arrival, he was himself mainly responsible[1039]: for the\r\nothers--Longa’s and Barcena’s strange failure to detach more troops\r\nto help the regiment of Asturias at Yanzi[1040], and Dalhousie’s late\r\narrival with the 7th Division--which never got into action or lost a\r\nman--he was not.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed, however, that Wellington’s intentions on August\r\n1st are a little difficult to follow. One would have supposed that he\r\nwould have devoted his main attention to a direct attempt to smash\r\nup Soult’s main body--but he never allotted more than the 4th, 7th,\r\nand Light Divisions to that task--while he had obviously another idea\r\nin his head, dealing with a larger scheme for the destruction of the\r\nenemy. At 9.30, when he had occupied Santesteban, he sent orders to\r\nByng, then at Elizondo, to bid him to march at once on the Pass of\r\nMaya, and to throw an advanced party into Urdax, on the French side of\r\nthe defile. At the same time Hill, at Irurita, is desired to follow\r\nByng, occupy Elizondo, and--if his troops can bear the strain--advance\r\neven to the Pass of Maya. Should this prove possible, Byng, when\r\nrelieved by Hill, should descend into France as far as Ainhoue on the\r\nNivelle. The 2nd Division, and the Portuguese division attached to it,\r\nwould follow him next morning. Hopes are expressed in the dispatch\r\nthat Pakenham and the 6th Division--last heard of at Eugui on the\r\n31st--would be in a position to combine their operations with those of\r\nHill[1041].\r\n\r\nThis descent into the valley of the Nivelle from the Maya pass must\r\nsurely have been imagined with the idea of encircling the whole\r\nFrench army at Echalar, for Ainhoue was well in Soult’s rear, and\r\ntroops placed there could cut him off from the direct road to Bayonne.\r\nOn the same evening Wellington was dictating a dispatch to Graham\r\ntelling him that he hoped to be at Maya next morning, and beyond the\r\nfrontier: Graham was therefore to prepare to cross the Bidassoa and\r\nattack Villatte with his and Giron’s full force, including cavalry\r\nand guns, leaving St. Sebastian blockaded by the necessary minimum\r\ndetachment[1042]. Meanwhile Alten, Dalhousie, and Cole were to mass in\r\nfront of the enemy’s position at Echalar. The only possible meaning\r\nthat can be drawn from these orders, when read together, is that\r\nWellington had now developed the complete encircling scheme for Soult’s\r\ndestruction, which he had _not_ thought out on July 31.\r\n\r\nBut the scheme was never put into execution. On August 2 Byng was\r\nhalted at Maya, Graham received no order to pass the Bidassoa, and\r\nall that was done was to execute an attack on Echalar--attended with\r\ncomplete success, it is true, but only resulting in pushing Soult back\r\ntowards the Nivelle, where there was no intercepting force waiting to\r\nwaylay him. Somewhere between 8 p.m. on the 1st and dawn on the 2nd\r\nWellington, for reasons which he did not avow to his staff or his most\r\ntrusted lieutenants, gave up the greater game, which had in it immense\r\npossibilities: for Soult had no longer an army that could fight--as\r\nevents at Echalar were to prove a few hours later. Minor causes for\r\nthis great piece of self-restraint can be cited. One was that Hill\r\nand Pakenham turned out not to be within easy supporting distance of\r\nByng, so that the dash into Soult’s rear could not be executed with\r\na sufficient force. If this operation were not carried out, Graham’s\r\nbecame useless. Certainly a reflection on the extremely depleted\r\ncondition of the 2nd Division, which had suffered such heavy losses at\r\nMaya, Beunza, and the Venta de Urroz, helped to deter Wellington from\r\nusing this exhausted force for his main stroke. Writing to Graham two\r\ndays later, he mentioned its condition as a cause of delay, along with\r\na general dearth of musket ammunition and shoes. But the main reason,\r\nas we shall see later, lay rather in the higher spheres of European\r\npolitics, and the explanation was reserved for the Minister of War in\r\nLondon alone. Next morning no general attack was delivered: Wellington\r\ndid not go to Maya, but merely joined the 4th and Light Divisions on\r\nthe Bidassoa. The great scheme was stillborn, and never took shape.\r\n\r\nSoult had gathered the wrecks of his army on the range of mountains\r\nbehind Echalar, where the Spanish-French boundary line runs. The\r\ncavalry had been at once packed off to the rear. The infantry took up\r\na position. Clausel’s three divisions were in the centre--Vandermaesen\r\nholding the village with a company, and with his main body--certainly\r\nnot 2,000 men that day--across the road on the slope above. Conroux’s\r\ndivision was on Vandermaesen’s right: Taupin’s, in reserve to\r\nboth the others, on the crest where the frontier runs. Reille’s\r\ncorps--still more depleted than Clausel’s, continued the line\r\nwestward--Lamartinière’s division next to Conroux’s, as far as the Peak\r\nof Ivantelly: Maucune’s--the most dilapidated unit in a dilapidated\r\narmy--holding the ground beyond the Ivantelly, with a flank-guard\r\nout on its right watching the road from Vera to Sarre. D’Erlon’s\r\ndivisions--still by far the most intact units of the whole command,\r\nwere on Clausel’s left, prolonging the line eastward and holding\r\na commanding position on the mountain side as far as the Peaks of\r\nSalaberry and Atchuria. It is doubtful whether the Marshal had 25,000\r\nmen in line that day in his eight divisions--not because the remainder\r\nwere all casualties or prisoners, but because the long retreat, with\r\nits incessant scrambling over mountain sides, had led to the defection\r\nof many voluntary and still more involuntary stragglers. The former\r\nwere scattered over the country for miles on every side, seeking for\r\nfood and for ‘a day off’--the latter had dropped behind from sheer\r\nexhaustion: there had been no regular distribution of rations since\r\nJuly 29th, and the first convoy of relief had been captured by Byng at\r\nElizondo on the 31st.\r\n\r\nWellington had only 12,000 men available in front of a very formidable\r\nposition--hills 1,500 or 1,800 feet high, with the peaks which\r\nformed the flank protection rising to 2,100 or 2,300. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances an attack would have been insane. Moreover, his troops\r\nwere almost as way-worn as those of Soult: the Light and 4th Divisions\r\nhad received no rations since the 30th, and the latter had lost a good\r\nthird of its strength in the very heavy fighting in which it had taken\r\nthe chief part between the 25th and the 30th. But their spirits were\r\nhigh, they had the strongest confidence in their power to win, and they\r\nwere convinced that the enemy was ‘on the run’--in which idea they were\r\nperfectly right.\r\n\r\nThe plan of attack was that the 4th and 7th Divisions should assail\r\nthe enemy’s centre, on each side of the village of Echalar, while the\r\nLight Division turned his western flank. This involved long preliminary\r\nmarching for Alten’s men, despite of their awful fatigues of the\r\npreceding day. They had to trudge from the bridge of Yanzi and Aranaz\r\nto Vera, where they turned uphill on to the heights of Santa Barbara,\r\na series of successive slopes by which they ascended towards the Peak\r\nof Ivantelly and Reille’s flank. Just as they began to deploy they got\r\nthe first regular meal that they had seen for two days: ‘The soldiers\r\nwere so weak that they could hardly stand; however, our excellent\r\ncommissary had managed to overtake us, and hastily served out half a\r\npound of biscuit to each individual, which the men devoured in the act\r\nof priming and loading just as they moved off to the attack[1043].’ The\r\nmorning was dull and misty--a great contrast to the blazing sunshine\r\nof the preceding day, and it was hard to get any complete view of the\r\nposition--clouds were drifting along the hills and obscuring parts of\r\nthe landscape for many minutes at a time. This chance put Wellington\r\nhimself in serious danger for a moment--pushing forward farther than\r\nhe knew, with a half-company of the 43rd to cover him, he got among\r\nthe French outposts, and was only saved by the vigilance of his escort\r\nfrom being cut off--he galloped back under a shower of balls--any\r\none of which might have caused a serious complication in the British\r\ncommand--it is impossible to guess what Beresford would have made of\r\nthe end of the campaign of 1813.\r\n\r\nWhile the Light Division was developing the flank attack, the front\r\nattack was already being delivered--somewhat sooner than Wellington\r\nexpected or intended. The plan had been for the 4th Division to\r\noperate against the French right--the 7th against their centre and\r\nleft centre. Cole, however, was delayed in getting forward by the\r\nimmense block of French débris along the narrow defile from Sumbilla\r\nto the bridge of Yanzi. ‘For two miles there were scattered along the\r\nroad papers, old rugs, blankets, pack-saddles, old bridles and girths,\r\nprivate letters, hundreds of empty and broken boxes, quantities of\r\nentrenching tools, French clothes, dead mules, dead soldiers, dead\r\npeasants, farriers’ tools, boots and linen, the boxes of M. le Général\r\nBaron de St. Pol[1044] and other officers, the field hospital of the\r\n2nd Division (Darmagnac’s), and all sorts of things worth picking\r\nup--which caused stoppage and confusion[1045].’\r\n\r\nNow the 7th Division did not follow the spoil-strewn river road, but\r\ncut across from Sumbilla towards Echalar, over the same hill-tracks\r\nwhich Clausel’s divisions had taken on the preceding afternoon, when\r\nthey escaped from the pursuit of Cole’s skirmishers. Hence it chanced\r\nthat they arrived in front of Echalar on a route where the enemy was\r\nkeeping no good watch, long before the 4th Division came up from the\r\nbridge of Yanzi and the Vera cross-roads. The mists on the hills had\r\nkept them screened--as Clausel complains in his report. Lord Dalhousie\r\nnow carried out a most dangerous manœuvre--a frontal attack on an enemy\r\nin position by a series of brigades arriving at long intervals--without\r\nany co-operation having been sought or obtained from the troops known\r\nto be on his left. ‘Bravery and success,’ as a Light-Division neighbour\r\nobserved, ‘certainly far exceeded judgement or utility[1046].’ What\r\nled the commander of the 7th Division to this astounding escapade was\r\nthe obvious unpreparedness of the enemy. ‘We caught them,’ he wrote,\r\n‘cooking above, and plundering below in the village. I thought it best\r\nto be at them instantly, and I really believe Barnes’s brigade was\r\namong them before their packs were well on[1047].’\r\n\r\nThe leading troops, and the only ones which really got into action,\r\nwere the three battalions (1/6th, 3rd Provisional[1048], and\r\nBrunswick-Oels) of Barnes’s brigade--led by that same fighting general\r\nwho had stopped the rout at Maya with two of these same battalions.\r\nBarnes got his line formed, and attacked uphill against the front of\r\nConroux’s division, long before Inglis’s brigade was ready to follow,\r\nor Lecor’s Portuguese had even got down from the hill path into the\r\nnarrow valley of the Sari stream. With such speed and vigour was the\r\nassault delivered, under a frontal fire from Conroux’s men, and a flank\r\nfire from Vandermaesen’s on the right, that Inglis’s brigade, which was\r\naiming at the village of Echalar, never had the chance of getting near\r\nits enemy. The advancing line suffered severely as it climbed--nearly\r\n300 casualties--but when it came against the front of Conroux, and\r\ndelivered its first volley, the enemy simply melted away[1049]. As\r\nClausel writes in apology, ‘the resistance ought to have been greater,\r\nand in the ordinary state of the army, that is to say when a better\r\nspirit prevailed, it would never have been possible for the enemy to\r\nestablish himself in this fashion on a section of the main chain of\r\nthe Pyrenees. This day the morale of the troops was bad[1050].’ It\r\nmust be remembered that Conroux’s was the division which had suffered\r\nso heavily in the village of Sorauren both on the 28th and the 30th\r\nof July. Several of its battalions were skeletons--all much thinned.\r\nStill there must have been 3,000 men yet present out of the original\r\n7,000--and they turned and fled before the uphill attack of 1,800 or\r\nless. Nor was this the end of the disaster. Clausel tried to hurry\r\nVandermaesen’s division to the succour of Conroux’s. But the manœuvre\r\nfailed: the French General says that Conroux’s flying troops ran in\r\nupon Vandermaesen’s, that confusion followed, and that he was obliged\r\nto let the whole mass roll back to seek shelter with Taupin’s division\r\nin the reserve line[1050].\r\n\r\nAt this moment the leading brigade of the 4th Division, that of Ross,\r\nat last appeared on Dalhousie’s left, and began to skirmish with\r\nLamartinière’s line[1051]: demonstrations began--probably by Lecor’s\r\nPortuguese--against the front of Maransin[1052], D’Erlon’s right-hand\r\ndivision. But these were of no importance in comparison with the effect\r\nof the turning of Reille’s end of the line by the Light Division. This\r\nwas almost as startling in effect as Barnes’s dealings with the French\r\ncentre. Having reached the front on the heights of Santa Barbara, below\r\nthe Peak of Ivantelly, Alten brushed aside Maucune’s feeble skirmishing\r\nline, and let loose five companies of the Rifle Brigade supported by\r\nfour of the 43rd against the dominating peak of the Ivantelly, the\r\nmost prominent feature of the French position. Clouds swept down along\r\nthe hills at this moment, and the supporting companies lost sight of\r\nthe front line. ‘An invisible firing commenced, and it was impossible\r\nto ascertain which party was getting the better of the fight: the\r\ncombatants were literally contending in the clouds[1053].’ But when the\r\n43rd came up, they found that the rifle companies had dislodged the\r\n2nd Léger, Lamartinière’s flank regiment, from the precipitous crest,\r\nand were in full possession of it. As they lost only 1 officer and 26\r\nmen in taking a most formidable peak, it is clear that the enemy’s\r\nresistance must have been very ineffective[1054].\r\n\r\nAll was now confusion on the French right wing--Reille speaks\r\nof himself as wandering about in a fog with three battalions of\r\nLamartinière’s, and meeting no one save the brigadier Montfort, who\r\nwas bringing up a mere 200 men to try to reinforce the troops on the\r\nIvantelly. The soldiers were profiting by the mist to go off to the\r\nrear, and could not be kept together. ‘On se tirailla faiblement, et\r\nnos troupes se retirèrent sur la route de Sarre.’ With his centre\r\nsmashed in, and his right dispersed, Soult could do nothing but\r\nretire. The remains of Clausel’s and Reille’s divisions fell back on\r\nthe road to Sarre. D’Erlon, who had never been attacked, could not\r\nuse this route, but made his way along the crest of the mountains to\r\nZagaramurdi, Urdax, and Ainhoue. What would have been his fate if he\r\nhad found there not the picquet which (by Wellington’s order) Byng had\r\nthrown forward to Urdax, but the whole of Byng’s and Hill’s troops\r\nblocking his retreat--as would have been the case if the great scheme\r\ndrawn up on the night of August 1 had been carried out? But the Pass of\r\nMaya had not been utilized that day, and D’Erlon had only to drive away\r\n50 men.\r\n\r\nThere was no pursuit: if there had been it would seem that the whole\r\nFrench army would have broken up, for it had shown itself this day\r\nno longer able to fight. ‘The spirit not only of the men but of the\r\nofficers,’ wrote Reille next morning, ‘has been very bad during these\r\nlast days. The absolute want of food must be the excuse for this\r\nstate of things.’ The condition of the army was deplorable--Maucune’s\r\ndivision showed less than 1,000 men holding together. The 1st Line of\r\nVandermaesen’s had precisely 27 men with the eagle--yet had lost only\r\n4 officers and 193 men in action--where were the remaining 400? Other\r\nunits could show a few hundred men but absolutely or practically no\r\nofficers--the 55th Line of Conroux had lost every one of 13 officers,\r\nthe 51st Line of Darmagnac 12 out of 17, the 34th Léger of Maucune\r\n30 out of 35; these were exceptionally hard cases, but in all the\r\ndivisions save those of Foy and Abbé (the least engaged during the\r\nshort campaign), the proportion was appalling. For the infantry of the\r\nwhole army it was 420 casualties among 1,318 officers present. Soult\r\nwrote to Clarke on the last day of the campaign: ‘I deceived myself in\r\nthe strangest way when I told your Excellency that the troops had their\r\nmorale intact, and would do their duty. I mistook the sentiment of\r\nshame for their recent disaster (Vittoria) for that of steadfastness.\r\nWhen tested, they started with one furious rush, but showed no power of\r\nresistance.... Since I first entered the service I have seen nothing\r\nlike this. It reminded me of the behaviour of the levy _en masse_ of\r\n1792. The spirit of these troops must be terribly broken to have\r\npermitted them to behave in this fashion. One general told me that he\r\nhad overheard men remarking, when we were near Pampeluna, that they\r\nhad better not fight too hard, because it would be preferable to get\r\nback to the frontier rather than to be led off into the middle of\r\nSpain[1055].’ These were cruel and spiteful words--the army had fought\r\nwith excellent courage, till after July 30th it had convinced itself\r\nthat the Marshal had got wrong with all his calculations, that the\r\ngame was up--that they were being taken on a wild goose chase without\r\nrations in the most desolate and rocky region of Europe. But by August\r\n2 Soult was not far out in his statement--on that day the greater part\r\nof his army was a spent force. If Wellington had resolved to pursue\r\nwith vigour, he could have pushed it as far as he pleased. Perhaps the\r\ngreat encircling scheme with which his mind dallied for a few hours on\r\nthe night of August 1 might have resulted in its surrender or complete\r\ndispersion.\r\n\r\nThis was not to be. On August 3 Wellington halted, and commenced to\r\nrearrange his troops on much the same principles, and in much the\r\nsame positions, that he had selected before. He wrote to Graham next\r\nday that he was perfectly well aware of the objection to taking up\r\na defensive position in the Pyrenees, but that an advance was too\r\nrisky[1056]. It was not so much the prospect of the wastage of his\r\ntroops, even in successful operation, that deterred him, though this\r\nwas the point on which he insisted in his letter to Graham, but the\r\ngeneral political situation of Europe. The eternal Armistice of\r\nPlässwitz was still holding up operations in Germany: it was still\r\npossible that the Allied Sovereigns might make a selfish peace\r\nwith Napoleon, and permit the Emperor to expand Soult’s army _ad\r\ninfinitum_ with sudden reinforcements. What would then become of\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese host, even if it had won its way not only to\r\nBayonne but to Bordeaux? All this he had considered, and wrote to the\r\nSecretary for War in Whitehall that ‘as for the immediate invasion\r\nof France, from what I have seen of the state of negotiations in the\r\nNorth of Europe, I have determined to consider it only in reference to\r\nthe convenience of my own operations.... If peace should be made by\r\nthe Powers of the North, I must necessarily withdraw into Spain.’ No\r\nadvance, however tempting the opportunity, should be made until he was\r\ncertain that war had recommenced in Saxony[1057]. Meanwhile, ‘Soult\r\nwill not feel any inclination to renew his expeditions--on this side at\r\nleast.’\r\n\r\nSo the army settled down to hold once more the line of the Pyrenees,\r\nand to resume the siege of St. Sebastian. On August 3 the Head-quarters\r\nwere once more at Lesaca, as they had been on July 25--how many things\r\nhad happened in the interval! Hill and the 2nd Division, now rejoined\r\nby the long-missing brigade of Byng, as also Silveira’s Portuguese,\r\nwere in the Maya passes once more. The 3rd Division was holding the\r\nRoncesvalles defiles, the 4th and 7th were at Echalar, the 6th in the\r\nAlduides (replacing Campbell’s Portuguese in that remote valley); the\r\nLight Division lay on the heights opposite Vera. Morillo’s Division was\r\nin the Bastan behind Hill, the part of the Army of Reserve of Andalusia\r\nwhich O’Donnell had carried to the front, when he left the rest before\r\nPampeluna, was at the moment near the bridge of Yanzi. The remainder\r\nof that army and Carlos de España were continuing the blockade of\r\nPampeluna.\r\n\r\nThe total losses of the Allies during the nine days’ ‘Campaign of the\r\nPyrenees’ had amounted to slightly over 6,400 officers and men for the\r\nEnglish and Portuguese[1058]. The Spanish loss could not add over 600\r\nmore--at Sorauren it was 192; Morillo’s casualties at Altobiscar, and\r\nthose of the regiment of Asturias at Yanzi bridge are the only unknown\r\nquantities, and can hardly have reached 400. The distribution among\r\ndivisions and corps was odd--the 3rd and Light Division had practically\r\nnegligible casualties: the former under 120, the latter under 50. The\r\nmain stress fell on the 2nd and 4th Divisions, the former with 2,000\r\nBritish and 350 Portuguese casualties, the latter with 1,400 and 300\r\nrespectively. But it must be remembered that the 2nd Division had\r\n(including Byng) four brigades, the 4th Division only three. Every\r\nunit in both was severely tried; the most terrible return was that\r\nof the 1/92nd with its 26 officers and 445 men killed, wounded, and\r\nmissing. But this was a strong battalion of 750 bayonets, and I am not\r\nsure that the 284 casualties of the 20th and the 296 casualties of the\r\n3/27th, both in the 4th Division, do not represent almost as great a\r\nproportional loss, as these were both much smaller corps.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Division was engaged on two days only, at the two battles\r\nof Sorauren, and had the appreciable number of 450 British and 370\r\nPortuguese casualties. The 7th Division fought on three days--at second\r\nSorauren, at the Combat of the Venta de Urroz, and at Echalar, and\r\nthree of its battalions also saved the day at Maya--with a loss in all\r\nof 750 British but only 60 Portuguese. Lastly, we must name the two\r\nPortuguese brigades of Silveira’s division, of which Campbell’s fought\r\nat Sorauren, Da Costa’s at Beunza, with a loss to the former of 350 and\r\nto the latter of 280 men. The general fact emerges that the 2nd and 4th\r\nDivisions lost between them 4,350 men out of the total 7,000--no other\r\ndivision had so many as 1,000 casualties.\r\n\r\nThe official list of French losses is not quite complete, as it\r\nincludes only the infantry and cavalry units--but such casualties\r\nas may have been suffered by the general staff, the artillery (very\r\nlittle engaged) sappers, and train can have added comparatively\r\nlittle to the total, though a good many men of the train were taken\r\nat Yanzi on August 1. The figures given work out to 12,563--1,308\r\nkilled, 8,545 wounded, and 2,710 prisoners. The last-named total should\r\nprobably be brought up to 3,000 in order to include individuals of the\r\nnon-combatant corps captured in the retreat. The divisions suffered\r\nin very unequal measure: Foy and Abbé got off very lightly, because\r\nthe one was practically not engaged at first Sorauren, nor the latter\r\nat Maya--they lost respectively only 550 and 750 men. Vandermaesen’s\r\nand Maucune’s Divisions--each a small unit of only 4,000 men, had the\r\ncrushing losses of 1,480 and 1,850 respectively, and were dissolved\r\nwhen the campaign was over, and re-formed to a large extent with\r\nbattalions drawn from the Bayonne reserve. Darmagnac and Conroux\r\neach lost well over 2,000 men out of 7,000--their divisions having\r\nbeen terribly cut up, the one at Maya the other at Sorauren. Maransin\r\nand Taupin each return over 1,000 men lost out of 6,000; Lamartinière\r\njust under 1,000 out of 7,000. The cavalry, barely engaged and quite\r\nuseless, had only 67 casualties to report.\r\n\r\nBut to get at Soult’s fighting strength on the last day of the retreat,\r\nit is not sufficient merely to deduct the 12,563 casualties from the\r\n59,000 which took the field in Navarre. The eight divisions collected\r\non the 2nd August were short not only of their own casualties, but of\r\nFoy’s division, which had gone off on an eccentric line of retreat, as\r\nhad several smaller detachments[1059]. But the great deficit was that\r\nof at least 8,000 or 10,000 stragglers, who rejoined at their leisure\r\nduring the next ten days. The cavalry and artillery had all gone to the\r\nrear, and it is doubtful if the last stand at Echalar was made with so\r\nmany as 25,000 weary infantry. If the Marshal had been faced with an\r\nopponent who had no political _arrière pensée_ to hold him back, he\r\nwould have been doomed to absolute destruction. Only a wreck of his\r\narmy would have escaped, and Wellington might have driven the remnants\r\nas far as he pleased--even to the gates of Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nBut the British General had made his ‘great refusal’ on the night of\r\nAugust 1st-2nd, and had resolved that the tempting scheme for invading\r\nFrance, which had flitted before his eyes for a few evening hours,\r\nmust be postponed. He would risk nothing till he should get certain\r\ninformation that the war had begun again in Germany. And as the news\r\nof the rupture of the Armistice did not reach him till September 3rd,\r\nhe was condemned to another month of waiting. He turned back to his\r\nold policy of June--St. Sebastian and Pampeluna must be reduced. When\r\nthey should have fallen, it would be time enough to see whether the\r\ngeneral European situation had made the invasion of France a feasible\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBRITISH LOSSES AT THE SIEGE OF BURGOS SEPTEMBER 20-OCTOBER 21, 1812\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sept. 20th, storm of the Hornwork of St. Michael.

There had been, immediately after the army reached Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\ncertain transferences of units from one division to another, which are\r\nduly noted. The figures give only rank and file; to get the fighting\r\nstrength one-eighth should be added to cover officers, sergeants, and\r\ndrummers.\r\n\r\n                                 _Present    _Present\r\n                                 under arms. under arms.\r\n                                 Oct. 23._   Nov. 29._\r\n\r\n  1st Cavalry Division               2,827   2,909 (2nd Hussars K.G.L.\r\n                                                     has joined.)\r\n  2nd Cavalry Division               1,947   1,625 (2nd Hussars K.G.L.\r\n                                                     has left.)\r\n  1st Division                       3,970   4,002 (1st & 3rd battalions\r\n                                                     First Guards have\r\n                                                     joined, but Stirling’s\r\n                                                     brigade has been\r\n                                                     transferred to the\r\n                                                     6th Division.)\r\n  2nd Division                       7,915   6,591\r\n  3rd Division                       4,229   3,860 (2/87th from Cadiz\r\n                                                     has joined.)\r\n  4th Division                       4,487   3,861 (1/82nd has joined.)\r\n  5th Division                       3,638   3,732 (2/47th from Cadiz\r\n                                                     has joined.)\r\n  6th Division                       3,380   5,228 (The division has been\r\n                                                     joined by Stirling’s\r\n                                                     brigade and also by\r\n                                                     the 1/91st.)\r\n  7th Division                       4,298   3,358\r\n  Light Division                     3,428   3,775 (2 companies 3/95th\r\n                                                     and the 20th Portuguese\r\n                                                     have joined.)\r\n  Hamilton’s Portuguese Division     4,719   4,076\r\n  Pack’s Portuguese Brigade          1,681   1,105\r\n  Bradford’s Portuguese Brigade      1,645     881\r\n                                    ------  ------\r\n                                    48,124  45,003\r\n\r\n  Artillery, Train, Staff Corps, &c. 2,500   2,300\r\n\r\nThe fall in numbers would have been much greater but for the joining\r\nof Skerrett’s force from Cadiz (3/1st Guards, 2/47th, 2/87th, 20th\r\nPortuguese, and two companies 3/95th) and of the 1/1st Guards and\r\n1/91st from England, and the 1/82nd from Gibraltar--in all, nearly\r\n6,000 men.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to give here the statistics of the Spanish troops\r\nwhich were acting with Wellington’s and Hill’s armies during this\r\nperiod. They were by their October morning states:\r\n\r\n  ‘6th Army’ or Galicians (Santocildes):\r\n\r\n    1st Division (Barcena)         6,810 (5 of the 15 battalions of this\r\n                                           division were not at the front.)\r\n    2nd Division (Cabrera)         4,749\r\n    3rd Division (Losada)          4,213\r\n    Cavalry Brigade (Figuelmonde)  1,356 (5 of the 9 squadrons of this\r\n                                           brigade were not at the front.)\r\n\r\n  5th Army (Estremadurans and Castilian):\r\n\r\n    Morillo’s Division             2,371 (Acting with Hill’s Corps.)\r\n    Carlos de España’s Division    3,809          (ditto.)\r\n    Penne Villemur’s cavalry         992          (ditto.)\r\n    Julian Sanchez’s cavalry       1,159 (Acting with Main Army.)\r\n                                  ------\r\n      Total Spanish troops        25,459\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLOSSES IN THE BURGOS RETREAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe casualties in action between October 23rd and November 19th are\r\neasily ascertainable, and quite moderate. But the loss in ‘missing’ by\r\nthe capture of stragglers, marauders, and footsore men, was much higher\r\nthan is generally known. I believe that the annexed table, from the\r\nmorning state of November 29th, is now published for the first time.\r\nIt gives only the _rank and file_ missing, but these are almost the\r\nwhole list: officers and sergeants did not straggle or drop behind like\r\nthe privates. I believe that the total of officers missing was 25, of\r\nsergeants 56 British and 29 Portuguese: we have also to add 43 British\r\nand 32 Portuguese drummers, &c., to the general list, which runs as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                               _British._ _Portuguese._ _Total._\r\n  1st Cavalry Division             192            --       192\r\n  2nd Cavalry Division             101             8       109\r\n  1st Division Infantry            283            --       283\r\n  2nd Division Infantry            302           260       562\r\n  3rd Division Infantry            184           230       414\r\n  4th Division Infantry            308            19       327\r\n  5th Division Infantry            453           359       812\r\n  6th Division Infantry             96            74       170\r\n  7th Division Infantry            357           243       600\r\n  Light Division Infantry           92           163       253\r\n  Portuguese. Hamilton’s Division   --           221       221\r\n  Portuguese. Pack’s Brigade.       --           293       293\r\n  Portuguese. Bradford’s Brigade    --           514       514\r\n                                 -----         -----     -----\r\n  Total                          2,368         2,374     4,752\r\n\r\nThe abnormally high totals of the 5th Division and 7th Division are to\r\nbe accounted for in different ways. The former had 150 prisoners taken\r\nin action on the day of the combat of Villa Muriel (October 25); the\r\nlatter contained the two battalions that always gave a high percentage\r\nof deserters, the foreign regiments of Brunswick-Oels and _Chasseurs\r\nBritanniques_. It will be noted that the 2nd Division has also a high\r\ntotal, but as it had nearly double the numbers of any other division\r\n(7,500 men to an average 4,000 for the others) it did not lose out of\r\nproportion to its strength. It will be noted that the Portuguese lost\r\nmore heavily in relation to their total numbers than the British--their\r\n‘missing’ were about the same as those of the British, but they only\r\nhad about 20,000 rank and file in the field as against about 30,000\r\nBritish. This excessive loss in missing was due entirely to the fact\r\nthat the cold and rain of the last ten days of the retreat told much\r\nmore heavily upon them. They were not so well clothed or fed as the\r\nBritish, and fell behind from exhaustion. Bradford’s brigade, though\r\nnever seriously in action, lost 500 men out of 1,600 by the roadside,\r\nmuch the heaviest percentage in the whole army.\r\n\r\nThe losses in killed and wounded as opposed to ‘missing’ seem to make\r\nup the following moderate figures, to which the heavy fighting about\r\nVenta del Pozo and Villa Muriel during the first days of the retreat\r\nmade much the heaviest contribution.\r\n\r\nKilled: 9 officers, 189 men. Wounded: 54 officers, 699 men--i. e. the\r\ntotal of 951. This does not, of course, include the _prisoners_ taken\r\nat Venta del Pozo or Villa Muriel, who are counted among the ‘missing’\r\nreckoned in the prefixed table.

My predecessors in Peninsular\r\nhistory sought in vain for the ‘morning states’ which should have\r\naccompanied Wellington’s dispatches to Lord Bathurst, and which are\r\nmentioned in those dispatches. In previous years, down to December\r\n1812, they are generally found annexed to the covering letter, in the\r\nbound volumes at the Record Office. I should have fared no better than\r\nother seekers, but for the admirable knowledge of the contents of the\r\nOffice possessed by Mr. Leonard Atkinson. He remembered that there\r\nexisted some separate packages of ‘morning states’, which had been\r\ndivorced from the rest of Wellington’s sendings, and not bound up with\r\nthem. When sought, they turned out to be the missing figures of 1813,\r\ntied up unbound between two covers of cardboard. Mr. Atkinson’s happy\r\ndiscovery enables me to give the prefixed statistics, which permit us\r\nto know Wellington’s exact strength just as the campaign of Vittoria\r\nwas starting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nSPANISH TROOPS UNDER WELLINGTON’S COMMAND JUNE-JULY 1813\r\n\r\nSTATES OF JUNE 1\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

But deductions of course must be made:\r\n\r\n  (1) For decrease from May 1 to June 21 in the Armies of Portugal and\r\n  the Centre, and from May 29 to June 21 in the Army of the South by\r\n  normal wastage, and in the two former by drafts sent back to France\r\n  in May.\r\n\r\n  (2) For casualties in action since the campaign opened.\r\n\r\nThe latter would not be large, only Digeon’s Dragoons and Villatte’s\r\nand Sarrut’s infantry divisions having been seriously engaged during\r\nthe retreat. The Burgos explosion cost Villatte over 100 men. We need\r\nnot allow more than 1,500 as an ample estimate for casualties in action.\r\n\r\nThe normal wastage, and the deduction for drafts sent to France in May\r\nare more difficult to calculate, but I think we shall not be far out in\r\ntaking 3,000 as an outside allowance for the latter--which affects only\r\nthe Armies of Portugal and the Centre, since we have a May 29th Return\r\nfor Gazan’s Army, which of course sent nothing away after that date.\r\nAnd in healthy months, such as May and early June, the deficit from\r\nextra sick would not be large--indeed as many men may have rejoined\r\nas convalescents as went into hospital, since (except Villatte at\r\nSalamanca) the troops had never been pressed or overmarched. It would\r\nbe generous to allow 5,000 for ‘wastage’.\r\n\r\nIf so, the French had 63,000 men at Vittoria, but deducting\r\nnon-combatants (train, artificers, &c.) there would be 9,000 horse,\r\nover 46,000 men in the infantry divisions, and about 1,300 gunners with\r\nthe field and horse batteries not included in the infantry divisions,\r\nalso 1,000 sappers. This makes over 57,000 fighting men actually\r\navailable. There must also be a small addition for stray units of the\r\nArmy of the North known to have been present--not less than 500 nor\r\nmore than 1,000.

These tables omit the following\r\nFrench battalions which were all undoubtedly on the Pyrenean frontier\r\nin July 1813 as they formed parts of the armies of the North and\r\nPortugal or of the old Bayonne Reserve in the returns of May, and are\r\nall found again present in the returns of September--1/3rd Line, 2/34th\r\nLine, 1 & 2/40th Line, 1 & 2/105th Line, 4/116th Line, 4/117th, 2/10th\r\nLigne: i.e. 8-1/2 battalions, which easily account for the 4,600 men\r\nshort in Soult’s total. After the battles of the Pyrenees, in which\r\nMaucune’s and Vandermaesen’s divisions were so cut up that they had to\r\nbe re-formed with new units, the following battalions, whose existence\r\nis concealed by Soult in his July table, were drafted in to them--1 &\r\n3/40th Line into Vandermaesen’s division, 1/3rd, 1 & 2/105th, 2/10th\r\nLéger, into Maucune’s. Obviously then, they were available, though\r\nomitted. The 4/116th and 4/117th (a fragment of four companies) came\r\ninto the fighting divisions later, but must have been somewhere behind\r\nthe Bidassoa all the time (having belonged to the old Bayonne Reserve).\r\n\r\n                                                         _Officers and\r\n                                                          men present._\r\n  Cavalry:\r\n\r\n    Acting as Corps-cavalry with the field army: 13th, 15th,\r\n      22nd Chasseurs                                              808\r\n\r\n    P.

Martinien’s lists supply 4 casualties\r\nof generals (Conroux, Schwitter, Rignoux, Meunier), and 12 of staff\r\nofficers. There must have been appreciable casualties in the other\r\nservices, especially men captured from the Train at the Yanzi disaster.\r\n\r\nSoult’s figures are always unreliable (as witness Albuera). The\r\ndetails above contain some ‘moral impossibilities’--e. g. the Return\r\ngives 63rd Line of Abbé’s Division 193 casualties, _not including\r\none officer_. But Martinien’s lists supply one officer-casualty at\r\nMaya, two at Beunza, two at Yanzi. Similarly 58th Line of Conroux has\r\nin the Official Return 473 casualties, including only 5 officers--1\r\nwounded and 4 prisoners. A reference to Martinien shows 2 officers\r\nkilled (one the colonel!) and 5 wounded--adding the 4 prisoners we get\r\n11 officer-casualties to 473 men: quite a possible percentage, which\r\nSoult’s is not.\r\n\r\nCaptain Vidal de la Blache (i. p. 280) gives a casualty list differing\r\nslightly from the above.

There had been seventy-four battalions\r\nin the Army of Portugal on July 1st: on August 1st there were only\r\nfifty-seven.\r\n\r\n[13] See ‘Memorandum for General Santocildes’ of August 5.\r\n_Dispatches_, ix. pp. 344-5.\r\n\r\n[14] _Dispatches_, ix. pp. 389-90.\r\n\r\n[15] The best account of all this is not (as might have been expected)\r\nin Foy’s dispatches to Clausel, but in a memorandum drawn up by him in\r\n1817 at the request of Sir Howard Douglas, and printed in an appendix\r\nat the end of the life of that officer (pp. 429-30). Sir Howard had\r\nasked Foy what he intended to do on the 23rd-27th August, and got a\r\nmost interesting reply.\r\n\r\n[16] Diary of Foy, in Girod de l’Ain’s _Vie militaire du Général Foy_,\r\np. 182.\r\n\r\n[17] Wellington to Bathurst, August 18th.\r\n\r\n[18] Wellington to Castaños, September 2. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 394.\r\n\r\n[19] See especially Sir Howard Douglas’s _Memoirs_, pp. 206-7, and\r\nTomkinson’s diary, p. 201. Napier is short and unsatisfactory at this\r\npoint, and says wrongly that Clausel abandoned Valladolid on the night\r\nof the 6th. His rearguard was certainly there on the 7th.\r\n\r\n[20] Castaños’s explanation was that Wellington’s letter of August 30,\r\ntelling him to march on Valladolid, did not reach him till the 7th\r\nSeptember, along with another supplementary letter to the same effect\r\nfrom Arevalo of September 3.\r\n\r\n[21] ‘The proclamation was made from the town-hall in the square: few\r\npeople of any respectability attended.’ Tomkinson, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[22] Tomkinson, p. 203.\r\n\r\n[23] Wellington to Henry Wellesley, Magaz, September 12. _Dispatches_,\r\nix. p. 422.\r\n\r\n[24] Napier, iv. p. 335.\r\n\r\n[25] Napier was not with the main army during this march, the Light\r\nDivision being left at Madrid. On the other hand Clausel had been very\r\npolite to him, and lent him some of his orders and dispatches (Napier,\r\niv. p. 327). I fancy he was repaid in print for his courtesy. The\r\ndiaries of Tomkinson, Burgoyne, D’Urban, and Sir Howard Douglas do not\r\ngive the impression that the French ever stayed to manœuvre seriously,\r\nsave on the 16th.\r\n\r\n[26] Head-quarters were at Valladolid, September 9; Cigales, September\r\n10; Dueñas, September 11; Magaz, September 12; Torquemada, September\r\n13; Cordovilla, September 14; Villajera, September 15; Pampliega,\r\nSeptember 16; Tardajos, September 17; Villa Toro, September 18.

Napier has a\r\ngood deal to say on it. Jones and Burgoyne tell nothing about it,\r\nbut they were evidently nettled at the idea that Douglas, who had no\r\nofficial position in the army, should have raised a proposal and got\r\nWellington to listen to it. I fancy that Douglas is one of the officers\r\nalluded to by Burgoyne (_Correspondence_, i. p. 234) as unauthorized\r\npersons, who volunteered useless advice. Gomm, p. 287, says, ‘we have\r\nset to work idly without having the means we might have commanded.’\r\n\r\n[50] Burgoyne, i. p. 220.\r\n\r\n[51] Ibid., i. p. 233.\r\n\r\n[52] Alexander Dickson remarks in his diary, p. 772, ‘This was done\r\nto please General Clinton, and had nothing to do with the attack.’\r\nClinton’s troops were opposite this side of the Castle, and had as yet\r\nnot been entrusted with any important duty.\r\n\r\n[53] Jones, i. p. 357.\r\n\r\n[54] For this dialogue, told at length, see Burgoyne’s\r\n_Correspondence_, ed.

(Belmas, iv. pp. 501 and 548). Putting aside the\r\nfact that there were no _English_ here at all, we may remark that\r\nBurgoyne (i. p. 226) says that _three_ Spaniards were buried in the\r\nruins, and that the loss of the Portuguese in the whole affair is put\r\nat 8 killed, 44 wounded, and 2 missing in Wellington’s report.\r\n\r\n[59] By knocking off their remaining trunnions, which made them\r\npermanently useless.

Allowing another 2,000 for\r\nartillery, sappers, &c., the total must have reached 53,000. Belmas\r\nsays that Caffarelli and Souham had only 41,000 men. Napier gives\r\nthem 44,000. Both these figures are far too low. No one denies that\r\nCaffarelli brought up about 10,000 men; and the Army of Portugal, by\r\nthe return of October 15, had 45,000 effectives, from whom there are\r\nonly to be deducted the men of the artillery park and the ‘équipages\r\nmilitaires.’ It must have taken forward 40,000 of all arms.

Martinien’s lists show 3 casualties of officers only, all\r\nin the 86th of Maucune’s division.\r\n\r\n[84] For details see Wellington’s Order of March in _Supplementary\r\nDispatches_, xiv. pp. 144-5.\r\n\r\n[85] The wheels of the artillery were all muffled with straw. The\r\ncavalry went at a walk.\r\n\r\n[86] So Colonel Béchaud’s narrative, quoted above, and most valuable\r\nfor all this retreat.\r\n\r\n[87] These figures look very large--and exceed Napier’s estimate of\r\n5,000 sabres. But I can only give the strength of the French official\r\nreturns, viz. Curto’s division 2,163, Boyer’s division 1,373, Merlin’s\r\nbrigade 746, Laferrière’s brigade 1,662; total 5,944. All these units\r\nwere engaged that day, as the French narrative shows, except that 4\r\nonly of the 6 squadrons of gendarmerie in Laferrière’s brigade were at\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\n[88] Owing to losses at Garcia Hernandez and Majadahonda the Germans\r\nwere only 4 squadrons, under 450 effective sabres. The Light Dragoons\r\nof Anson, all three regiments down to 2-squadron strength, made up\r\nabout 800.\r\n\r\n[89] See vol. iv. pp. 565-9.\r\n\r\n[90] Who was not himself any longer at their head, having been killed\r\nin a private quarrel some weeks before. His men were this day under his\r\nlieutenant Puente (Schepeler, p. 680).\r\n\r\n[91] To Caffarelli’s high disgust: see his dispatch to Clarke of\r\nOctober 30, where he calls Boyer’s action a ‘fatalité que l’on ne peut\r\nconçevoir.’\r\n\r\n[92] As Lumley did at Usagre against L’Allemand, see vol. iv. p. 412.\r\n\r\n[93] Anson’s brigade fought, it is said, with only 600 sabres out of\r\nits original 800, owing to heavy losses in the morning, and to the\r\ndropping behind of many men on exhausted horses, who did not get up\r\nin time to form for the charge. Bock’s brigade was intact, but only\r\n400 strong. Of the French brigade 1,600 strong on October 15 by its\r\n‘morning state’ two squadrons out of the six of gendarmes were not\r\npresent, so that the total was probably 1,250 or so engaged.\r\n\r\n[94] Most of this detail is from the admirable account of von\r\nHodenberg, aide-de-camp to Bock, whose letter I printed in _Blackwood_\r\nfor 1913. There is a good narrative also in Martin’s _Gendarmerie\r\nd’Espagne_, pp. 317-19.\r\n\r\n[95] In a conversation with Foy (see life of the latter, by Girod de\r\nl’Ain, p. 141) when he said that _all_ the cavalry generals of the\r\nArmy of Portugal except Montbrun, Fournier, and Lamotte were ‘mauvais\r\nou médiocres’--these others being Curto, Boyer, Cavrois, Lorcet, and\r\nCarrié.\r\n\r\n[96] Details are worth giving. The 2nd Dragoons K.G.L. had 52\r\ncasualties, the 1st 44. In Anson’s brigade the 11th Light Dragoons lost\r\n49, the 12th only 20, the 16th 47. The officers taken prisoners were\r\nColonel Pelly and Lieutenant Baker of the 16th, Major Fischer (mortally\r\nwounded) of the 1st Dragoons K.G.L., and Captain Lenthe and Lieutenant\r\nSchaeffer of the 2nd Dragoons K.G.L. The two infantry battalions had 18\r\ncasualties, of whom 13 were men missing, apparently skirmishers cut off\r\nin the fight earlier in the day on the Hormaza, or footsore men who had\r\nfallen behind.\r\n\r\n[97] H. Sydenham to Henry Wellesley, printed in _Wellington\r\nSupplementary Dispatches_, vii. pp. 464-5. Sydenham understates,\r\nhowever, the available force when he says that Anson had only 460\r\nsabres and Bock only two squadrons. Hodenberg diminishes less, but\r\nstill too much, when he gives Bock 300 sabres and Anson 600. The real\r\nnumbers are given above.\r\n\r\n[98] Napier, iv. p. 361. Corroboration may be had on p. 120 of the\r\n_Journal_ of Green of the 68th, who says that his colonel was much\r\npuzzled to know how so many men had succeeded in getting liquor, and\r\nthat one soldier was drowned in a vat, overcome by the fumes of new\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n[99] This was Bonnet’s old division: Chauvel had been commanding it\r\nsince Bonnet was disabled at Salamanca. But he had been wounded by a\r\nchance shot at Venta del Pozo on the 23rd, and Gauthier, his senior\r\nbrigadier, had taken it over.\r\n\r\n[100] Some 27 men of the 3/1st, taken prisoners here, represent this\r\nparty in the casualty list of October 25. The battalion was not\r\notherwise seriously engaged.\r\n\r\n[101] Who were drawn from the 4th, 30th, and 44th.\r\n\r\n[102] For a romantic story of how one was discovered see Napier, iv. p.\r\n363, a tale which I have not found corroborated in any other authority.\r\n\r\n[103] I had not been able to make out how the 1/9th came to lose these\r\nprisoners till I came on the whole story in the Autobiography of Hale\r\nof the 1/9th, printed at Cirencester 1826, a rare little book, with a\r\ngood account of this combat. He is my best source for it on the British\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[104] Hale, p. 95, quoted above.\r\n\r\n[105] I have been using for the French side mainly the elaborate\r\nand interesting narrative of Colonel Béchaud of the 66th, recently\r\npublished in _Études Napoléoniennes_, ii. pp. 405-11.\r\n\r\n[106] See Béchaud, p. 410.\r\n\r\n[107] These modest figures of Foy’s report to Souham are much\r\nexaggerated in most French narratives of the affair.\r\n\r\n[108] There is a full account of this business in Foy’s dispatch to\r\nSouham of the next morning, in which occur all the facts given by\r\nGuingret in his own little book. That officer’s narrative must be taken\r\nas fully correct.\r\n\r\n[109] All this from Burgoyne, i. p. 244. Napier does not mention the\r\nearthworks, which were batteries for six guns each.\r\n\r\n[110] There he wrote his dispatch, concerning the late combats, to\r\nClarke. Napier never mentions Caffarelli’s departure--a curious\r\nomission.\r\n\r\n[111] p. 437.\r\n\r\n[112] See vol. v. pp. 538-9.\r\n\r\n[113] Deprez, travelling with great speed, reached Paris and\r\ninterviewed Clarke on September 21. The Minister, who was no friend of\r\nSoult’s, told him that neither he himself nor the King could dare to\r\ndepose the Marshal without the Emperor’s permission. Deprez then posted\r\non to Moscow, and overtook the Emperor there on October 18. Napoleon\r\nin his reply practically ignored the quarrel, contented himself with\r\nadministering a general scolding to all parties, and directed them to\r\n‘unite, and diminish as far as possible the evils that a bad system had\r\ncaused.’ But who had inaugurated the system? He himself!\r\n\r\n[114] Joseph to Clarke, September 7.\r\n\r\n[115] See Soult to Joseph of October 11, and other days.\r\n\r\n[116] Which were the 27th Chasseurs and 7th Polish Lancers.\r\n\r\n[117] For details see Table of the Army of Spain of the date October\r\n15th, in Appendix II to this volume.\r\n\r\n[118] Joseph to Soult, Valencia, October 12.\r\n\r\n[119] See above, vol. v. p. 332.\r\n\r\n[120] Napier and Jourdan say that Cearra was killed; but he only\r\nsuffered concussion of the brain, and survived to tell Schepeler (p.\r\n688) how his sword and its sheath were melted into one rod of metal\r\nby the lightning which ran down the side of the couch on which he was\r\nlying at the moment.\r\n\r\n[121] See, e. g., Schepeler (p. 689), who was present.\r\n\r\n[122] See _Dispatches_, ix. p. 518.\r\n\r\n[123] This is clearly stated in Wellington’s note to Hill of October\r\n10. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 481.\r\n\r\n[124] Ibid., p. 485.\r\n\r\n[125] When Penne Villemur moved in, and went behind the Tagus, I cannot\r\nmake out exactly. But it was before October 25th, as at that time\r\nErskine’s British cavalry had no longer any screen in front of them.\r\n\r\n[126] All these dispositions come from a table of routes sent to\r\nD’Urban by Jackson, Hill’s chief of the staff (Quartermaster-general),\r\non the 24th.\r\n\r\n[127] Jackson, Q.M.G., to D’Urban, 27th night: ‘Sir Rowland has\r\ndetermined to concentrate behind the Jarama, on account of the state of\r\nthe fords upon the Tagus, and their number,’ &c.\r\n\r\n[128] They had been at Arganda behind the Tajuna on the previous day,\r\nwhen Hill was still thinking of defending the line of the Tagus. See\r\n_Diary of Leach_, p. 287.\r\n\r\n[129] Jackson to D’Urban, October 27: ‘Keep your patrols on the Tagus\r\nas long as they can with prudence stay there, with orders to follow the\r\nmarch of your main body.’ On the next day the order is varied to that\r\nquoted above.\r\n\r\n[130] Owing to disgraceful carelessness on the part of a brigadier\r\nof the British 2nd Division much of the boat-bridge of Fuente Dueñas\r\n(which had been brought over to the north bank) had not been burnt when\r\nthe troops retired. Many boats were intact; some of the French swam\r\nover, and brought back several of them. (D’Urban MSS.)\r\n\r\n[131] Wellington to Hill, Cabezon, October 27. _Dispatches_, ix. pp.\r\n518-19.\r\n\r\n[132] See for this Wachholz (of the Fusilier brigade), Schepeler,\r\nPurdon’s history of the 47th, &c. Wachholz’s Brunswick Company\r\nstraggled so that of 60 men he found only 7 with him at night. Several\r\nwere lost for good. Wellington put the colonel of the 82nd under\r\narrest, because he had lost 80 men this day.\r\n\r\n[133] D’Erlon’s old division now commanded by this brigadier.\r\n\r\n[134] Always a reckless falsifier of his own losses (he said that he\r\nhad only lost 2,800 men at Albuera!), Soult wrote in his dispatch\r\nthat he had only about 25 wounded at the Puente Larga. The figure I\r\ngive above is that of the staff-officer d’Espinchel, whose memoirs\r\nare useful for this campaign. By far the best English account is that\r\nof H. Bunbury of the 20th Portuguese (_Reminiscences of a Veteran_,\r\ni. pp. 158-63). I can only trace three of the five French officers\r\nin Martinien’s lists--Pillioud, Caulet, Fitz-James, but do not doubt\r\nd’Espinchel’s figures though his account of the combat is hard to\r\nfit in with any English version. He speaks with admiration of the\r\nsteadiness of the defence.\r\n\r\n[135] All this from Soult’s dispatch to the King of October 31, from\r\nValdemoro, and Jourdan’s to Clarke from Madrid of November 3rd.\r\n\r\n[136] See _Diary of Swabey, R.A._, p. 428, in _Journal of the Artillery\r\nInstitution_, vol. xxii.\r\n\r\n[137] The importance of the second evacuation of Madrid is brought\r\nout by no historian of the war except Vacani, vi. pp. 188-90. Napier\r\nbarely mentions it. A curious story of the fate of certain English\r\nprisoners of Hill’s army, who were forgotten in prison, and came out\r\nagain to liberty when the French army moved on, may be found in the\r\nautobiography of Harley of the 47th Regiment.\r\n\r\n[138] Napier (iv. p. 373) says that Joseph left a garrison and his\r\nimpedimenta in Madrid--I can find no trace of it in the contemporary\r\naccounts, e. g. of Romanos (_Memorias de un Setenton_) or of Harley\r\nwho was about the town during the second week of November. Vacani\r\ndistinctly says that Joseph had to take on even his sick (vi. p. 190).\r\nCf. also Arteche, xi. pp. 309-12.\r\n\r\n[139] Napier, iv. p. 373, says that Joseph went by the route of Segovia\r\nto Castile. I cannot think where he picked up this extraordinary idea.\r\nJourdan’s dispatch of November 10 from Peñaranda gives all the facts.\r\nIt was on the 5th, near Villacastin, that Soult told Joseph that Hill\r\nwas about to be joined by Wellington and that the two might crush him.\r\nThe King at once sent orders to Drouet to come up by forced marches\r\nfrom Madrid. The Army of the Centre started next day. Palombini did not\r\nget off till the 8th (Vacani, vi. p. 190), but the head of the column\r\nreached Villacastin that same day.\r\n\r\n[140] Wellington to Hill, November 3. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 532.\r\n\r\n[141] His first definite information as to this was from a Spaniard who\r\non November 4 saw 3,000 French infantry marching through Torquemada\r\ntowards Burgos (_Dispatches_, ix. p. 544). Even so late as November 8th\r\nhe did not rely on this important news as correct.\r\n\r\n[142] From Rueda, November 5, morning. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 537.\r\n\r\n[143] They had really not the 50,000 on which Wellington speculated\r\n(’45,000 men I should consider rather below the number’ (_Dispatches_,\r\nix. p. 544) ) but 60,000 or very nearly that number. But, on the day\r\nwhen Wellington was writing, their rear had not even started from\r\nMadrid, and Soult’s 40,000 men were strung out all along the road.\r\n\r\n[144] As a matter of fact, using the best map of 1812 available to me\r\n(Nantiat’s), it would seem that the line Rueda-Fuentesauco-Salamanca is\r\nabout 50 miles, that by Rueda-Nava del Rey-Pitiegua-Salamanca about 55\r\nmiles, while the route suggested for the French, circuitous and running\r\nin more than one place by country cross-paths, is over 65 miles long,\r\nnot to speak of its being a worse route for topographical reasons.\r\n\r\n[145] An under-estimate by several thousands. Wellington did not know\r\nof Aussenac’s brigade from Bayonne, over 3,000 men, which had now been\r\nattached provisionally to the Army of Portugal.\r\n\r\n[146] The total which marched was 60,000, so Wellington was even more\r\ncorrect than he supposed in his notion that 45,000 was too small a\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n[147] Wellington to Lord Bathurst, Pitiegua, November 8. _Dispatches_,\r\nix. pp. 544-5.\r\n\r\n[148] _Dispatches_, ix. p. 520.\r\n\r\n[149] Wellington to Hill, Rueda, November 5. _Dispatches_, ix. p. 537.\r\n\r\n[150] Ibid., p. 539.\r\n\r\n[151] I cannot find the details of the marching orders of the\r\ndivisions; but from personal diaries I seem to deduce that the 5th and\r\n7th Divisions marched by Alaejos, the 1st and 6th by Castrejon and\r\nVallesa, while the cavalry not only provided a rearguard but kept out\r\nflank detachments as far as Cantalapiedra on one side and the lower\r\nGuarena on the other.\r\n\r\n[152] All this from the detailed routes of march in the dispatches of\r\nJackson (Hill’s Q.M.G.) to D’Urban on November 4-5-6.\r\n\r\n[153] See his dispatch of November 8 from Flores de Avila.\r\n\r\n[154] For an adventure with these rascals, who threatened to shoot one\r\nof Hill’s aides-de-camp, see Schepeler, p. 691.\r\n\r\n[155] The ground on which Del Parque had fought his unlucky battle in\r\n1809.\r\n\r\n[156] These movements from Jourdan to Clarke, of November 10, and Soult\r\nto Clarke of November 12.\r\n\r\n[157] See the Notes of the Baden officer Riegel (vol. iii. p. 537), who\r\ncomplains bitterly of the piercing north wind, and the lack of wood to\r\nbuild fires.\r\n\r\n[158] D’Espinchel (ii. p. 71) says that the voltigeurs got within the\r\nwalls, but were expelled on each occasion. The English narratives deny\r\nthat they ever closed, or reached the barricades.\r\n\r\n[159] Soult to Joseph, 8 a.m. on the 11th, ‘bivouac sur la hauteur en\r\narrière d’Alba de Tormes.’\r\n\r\n[160] General Hamilton’s account of the business (Dispatch to Hill,\r\n_Wellington Dispatches_, ix. p. 558) is very clear. There is also\r\na good account of the Alba fighting in Colonel Gardyne’s excellent\r\nhistory of the 92nd.\r\n\r\n[161] All their names verifiable from Martinien’s admirable lists of\r\n‘_Officiers tués et blessés_.’\r\n\r\n[162] See Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 441, for the meeting.\r\n\r\n[163] Wellington to Hill, November 10, 4.30 p.m. (_Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n549).\r\n\r\n[164] Same to same, November 11 (ix. p. 550).\r\n\r\n[165] Same to same, pp. 550-1.\r\n\r\n[166] Jourdan to Joseph, head-quarters at Peñaranda: early on November\r\n12.\r\n\r\n[167] Soult to Joseph, night of November 11, from the bivouac behind\r\nAlba de Tormes.\r\n\r\n[168] As the table of the French Armies of Spain for October 15 in the\r\nAppendix shows, the Army of the South had on that day 47,000 men under\r\narms (omitting ‘sick’ and ‘detached’), the Army of the Centre 15,000,\r\nthe Army of Portugal 45,000 (including Aussenac’s brigade and Merlin’s\r\ncavalry, both attached to it provisionally). This gives a total of\r\n107,000, without sick or detached. The Army of Portugal may have lost\r\n1,000 men in action at Villadrigo and Villa Muriel, &c.: the Army of\r\nthe South not more than 400 at the Puente Larga, Alba de Tormes, &c.\r\nThe Army of the Centre had not fought at all. A deduction has to be\r\nmade for Soult’s very large body of men attached to the Artillery Park,\r\nand for a smaller number in the Army of Portugal--say 3,000 men for the\r\ntwo together. Souham had left a small garrison at Valladolid--perhaps\r\n1,500 men. If we allow 5,000 men for sick and stragglers between\r\nOctober 20 and November 12 there must still have been a good 90,000 men\r\npresent. Miot (who was present) calls the total 97,000 (iii. p. 254),\r\nmaking it a little too high, I imagine.\r\n\r\n[169] Maucune and Gauthier (late Chauvel). See _Wellington Dispatches_,\r\nix. p. 556.\r\n\r\n[170] Souham naturally expressed his indignation. See Miot, iii. p.\r\n252-3.\r\n\r\n[171] D’Urban reports on November 12th: ‘Enemy’s troops in continual\r\nmovement, and he made a careful reconnaissance of the river from Huerta\r\nto Exeme [above Alba].’ On the 13th he writes: ‘The enemy moved all\r\nhis troops between Huerta and Alba by his left into the woods behind\r\nExeme on the high road to Avila. From thence he can either go in that\r\ndirection or cross the Tormes by fords above Alba bridge.’\r\n\r\n[172] This fact, very important in justification of Wellington’s long\r\nstay on San Cristobal, is not mentioned in any of his dispatches. But\r\nthere is a full account of the skirmish in the _Mémoire_ of Colonel\r\nBéchaud of Maucune’s Division, printed in _Études Napoléoniennes_, iii.\r\npp. 98-9.\r\n\r\n[173] The reconnaissance was executed by Leith Hay, who found the\r\nFrench flank at Galisancho and reported its exact position. See his\r\n_Narrative_, ii. pp. 99-100.\r\n\r\n[174] Details from Foy’s _Vie militaire_, ed. Girod de l’Ain, p. 118,\r\nand Béchaud (quoted above), pp. 99-100.\r\n\r\n[175] His original intention to attack is clearly stated in\r\n_Dispatches_, ix. p. 559, and the statement is corroborated by D’Urban.\r\n\r\n[176] D’Urban, an eye-witness, thinks that Wellington ought to have\r\ncalled up Hill and attacked, despite of all difficulties. ‘Lord\r\nWellington arrived upon the ground at about 12 noon, and at first\r\nappeared inclined to attack what of the enemy had already passed, with\r\nthe divisions and cavalry on the spot. The success of such a measure\r\nappeared certain, and would have frustrated all the enemy’s projects.\r\nHowever, his opinion changed: they were allowed to continue passing\r\nunmolested.’\r\n\r\n[177] _Mémoires_, p. 448. Cf. also Napier, iv. p. 381, who seems to\r\nshare the idea. ‘Why, it may be asked, did the English commander,\r\nhaving somewhat carelessly suffered Soult to pass the Tormes and turn\r\nhis position, wait so long on the Arapiles position as to render a\r\ndangerous movement (retreat in face of the enemy and to a flank)\r\nnecessary?’\r\n\r\n[178] This horrid reminiscence I found in the unpublished letters\r\nof Hodenberg of the 1st Heavy Dragoons K.G.L., which I reprinted in\r\n_Blackwood’s Magazine_ in the year 1913.\r\n\r\n[179] Details about the exact drawing-up of the second line and\r\nreserves seem impossible to discover. I have only accurate notes as\r\nto the position of the front line and some of the cavalry and the 1st\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n[180] For doing this Jourdan criticized Soult for over-caution, and\r\nwasting of time, describing this measure as timid and unnecessary.\r\n_Mémoires_, p. 443.\r\n\r\n[181] Donaldson of the 94th. _Recollections_, p. 179.\r\n\r\n[182] The 4th Division formed the infantry rearguard on the southern\r\nroad, the Light Division that on the central road.\r\n\r\n[183] Colonel James Willoughby Gordon seems not to have been a\r\nsuccess as quarter-master-general. Very soon after his arrival we get\r\nnotes in the earlier part of the Salamanca campaign that intelligent\r\nofficers ‘thought he would not stop long with the Army.’ Cf.\r\nTomkinson, p. 224: ‘Nothing could equal the bad arrangements of the\r\nQuartermaster-General--the cavalry all retired by one road, allowing\r\nthat of the enemy to follow our infantry’ [of the central column on\r\nNovember 18]--which was not covered, all the horse having gone on the\r\nwestern or left road. Wellington had a worse accusation against him\r\nthan mere incapacity (of this more will be found in chap. iii of sect.\r\nxxxv)--that of sending letters home which revealed military secrets\r\nwhich got into the English papers. In September he made up his mind\r\nthat Gordon must not see his dispatches, and must be ‘kept at as great\r\ndistance as possible’ (_Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. pp. 427-8). He\r\nwas sent home before the next campaign.\r\n\r\n[184] D’Urban’s diary.\r\n\r\n[185] See Foy, _Vie militaire_, p. 190. He was a witness to the\r\nconversation. And cf. Espinchel, _Mémoires_, ii. p. 73, who gets the\r\nhour too late and exaggerates the contact of the armies. He says that\r\n12 of Hill’s guns opened on the French light cavalry. Cf. also Joseph\r\nto Clarke of December 20.\r\n\r\n[186] Espinchel, ii. p. 73.\r\n\r\n[187] Joseph to Clarke, in a long dispatch of December 20. Ducasse’s\r\n_Correspondance du Roi Joseph_, ix. pp. 119-20.\r\n\r\n[188] See above, p. 126.\r\n\r\n[189] For the curious adventures of Captain v. Stolzenberg commanding\r\nthis little party, and of the horde which he shepherded, see\r\nSchwertfeger’s History of the K.G.L., ii. pp. 262-3.\r\n\r\n[190] _Mémoires_ of Béchaud, quoted above, p. 101.\r\n\r\n[191] Foy, _Vie militaire_, pp. 189-90.\r\n\r\n[192] Soult to King Joseph, Matilla, 16th November 1812.\r\n\r\n[193] There is a good account of the skirmish in the _Mémoires_ of\r\nEspinchel, ii. p. 73, who frankly allows that the French light cavalry\r\nwere both outmanœuvred and repulsed with loss. The returns of the three\r\nFrench regiments show 22 killed, _no_ wounded, and 25 missing--an odd\r\nproportion. Apparently the wounded must all have been captured. The 1st\r\nHussars K.G.L. had 7 wounded and 7 missing, the rest of Alten’s brigade\r\nunder 20 casualties. This brigade was now _three_ regiments strong\r\ninstead of two, having had the 2nd Hussars K.G.L. from Hill’s Army\r\nattached to it at Salamanca.\r\n\r\n[194] Napier says that the column went through Tamames, but no\r\n2nd, 3rd, or 4th Division diary mentions that considerable town as\r\npassed--they all speak of solitudes and oak-woods alone. Wellington’s\r\norders on the night of November 16 (_Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. p.\r\n157) give ‘La Neja’ as Hill’s destination, and this oddly spelt place\r\nis undoubtedly Anaya de Huebra.\r\n\r\n[195] Memoirs of Donaldson of the 94th, pp. 181-2.\r\n\r\n[196] See the Memoirs of Grattan of the 88th, and Bell of the 34th.\r\n\r\n[197] See Wellington’s Marching Orders for the 17th in _Supplementary\r\nDispatches_, xiv. pp. 157-8, for the cavalry. A perverse reading of\r\nthem might make the cavalry start too early for ‘the brook which passes\r\nby La Maza and Aldehuela’, where they are told to be at dawn. They are\r\nnot actually directed to wait for the infantry rearguard.\r\n\r\n[198] There is a full account of his capture in the memoirs of\r\nEspinchel, ii. p. 77, the officer whose men took Paget prisoner.\r\n\r\n[199] The movements of this day are made very difficult to follow by\r\nthe fact that Wellington in his dispatches (ix. 464-5) calls Hill’s\r\ncolumn the right, and the Spanish column the left, of the three in\r\nwhich the Army marched. Vere’s _Diary of the Marches of the 4th\r\nDivision_ does the same. But these directions are only correct when the\r\narmy faced about and stopped to check the French. On the march Hill’s\r\nwas the left column, and the Spaniards the right. For this reason I\r\nhave called them the southern and northern columns respectively.\r\n\r\n[200] Soult to Joseph, November 17, from before San Muñoz.\r\n\r\n[201] So the regimental histories (both good) of these corps.

About 100\r\nBritish stragglers were gathered in.\r\n\r\n[207] The tale may be found with details, told from Wellington’s point\r\nof view, in _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. p. 494. The chief offender\r\nwas W. Stewart, who had succeeded to the command of the 1st Division on\r\nPaget’s capture the preceding day. The others Wellington describes as\r\n‘new-comers’ so they must have been Oswald and Lord Dalhousie, for the\r\nother divisional commanders in this column, Clinton and C. Alten, were\r\nnot in any sense ‘new-comers’. I think, therefore, that Mr. Fortescue\r\nis wrong in giving the names of the culprits as Stewart, Dalhousie, and\r\nClinton.\r\n\r\n[208] See Napier, iv. p. 386. But cf.

There is no general notice as to\r\ncantonments in the _Wellington Dispatches_ to help. But see General\r\nOrders for December 1, 1812, as to the post-towns for each division.\r\n\r\n[217] Their cases are in General Orders for 1813, pp. 51-3. Each was\r\ncondemned to six months’ suspension, but the members of the court\r\nmartial petitioned for their pardon, on account of the privations of\r\nthe time. Wellington grudgingly granted the request ‘not concurring\r\nin any way in the opinion of the court, that their cases in any way\r\ndeserved this indulgence.’\r\n\r\n[218] Bunbury, aide-de-camp to General Hamilton, referring to\r\nWellington’s memorandum, makes solemn asseveration that his troops got\r\nno distribution whatever for those four days.

The light battalion was formed of companies from the 3rd, 7th,\r\n8th Line of the K.G.L. and from de Roll and Dillon. The Italians were\r\n‘2nd Anglo-Italian Levy’.

There\r\nwould not be more than 40 or 45 officers present with two battalions.\r\n\r\n[390] Expressed at some length in the great guerrillero’s _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[391] Who has a long and interesting narrative of the expedition in his\r\nvol. vi. pp. 240-50.\r\n\r\n[392] Vacani’s statement that the Italian division lost this day only\r\n110 men, is made absurd by the lists in Martinien, which show that\r\nthe 4th, 6th, and 2nd Ligeros lost that day 3 officers killed and 16\r\nwounded--which implies a total casualty list of at least 350.\r\n\r\n[393] In Martinien’s lists there are five officer-casualties given for\r\nthis fight, but they do not include all the names of officers mentioned\r\nas killed by Vacani in his narrative.\r\n\r\n[394] Not the 24th as in Vacani and Belmas. See Girod de l’Ain’s _Life\r\nof Foy_, p. 260.\r\n\r\n[395] Figures in Belmas are (in detail) Foy’s own division (10\r\nbattalions) 5,513 men, Palombini’s (5 battalions) 2,474, artillery 409,\r\nSarrut’s division about 4,500. Foy left behind Aussenac’s brigade about\r\n1,500, and the garrison of Bilbao about 2,000.\r\n\r\n[396] For horrid details of mishandlings of both sexes see Marcel (of\r\nthe 6th Léger) in his _Campagnes d’Espagne_, pp. 193-4. Marcel is a\r\n_raconteur_, but Belmas bears him out (iv. p. 566).\r\n\r\n[397] Napier says the Spanish loss was 180--which seems more probable.\r\nThe British ships lost one officer and sixteen men wounded, by Bloye’s\r\nreport. As to the French loss, we have the names of 3 officers killed\r\nand 6 wounded during the operation--which looks like 150 to 180\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\n[398] See above, vol. ii. p. 341.\r\n\r\n[399] 1/10th, 1/27th, 1/58th, 1/81st, and 2/27th which came in time for\r\nCastalla, also a battalion of grenadier companies of units in Sicily.\r\n\r\n[400] 4th and 6th Line battalions, and a light battalion composed of\r\nthe light companies of 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and of De Roll and\r\nDillon.\r\n\r\n[401] Three companies of De Roll and four of Dillon--the whole making\r\nup a battalion 800 bayonets and the Calabrese Free Corps.\r\n\r\n[402] 1st and 2nd Italian Levy, and two battalions of Sicilian Estero\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\n[403] Those of Villacampa, Mijares, and Sarsfield.\r\n\r\n[404] For details see letter of February 22nd in Sir Samuel\r\nWhittingham’s _Memoirs_, pp. 172-4. He says that Colonel Grant,\r\ncommanding the 2nd Italian Levy, had made himself cordially detested by\r\nhis men by ‘employing the minute worry of the old British School,’ and\r\nthat Bourke of the 1st Italian Levy had much more control over his men.\r\n\r\n[405] Murray to Wellington. _Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. p. 191.\r\n\r\n[406] See his letter of March 19th, written after the skirmish: ‘Our\r\narmy is concentrating itself, and a few days I hope will bring on a\r\ngeneral action, in which I hope to play my part’ (_Memoirs_, p. 188).\r\n\r\n[407] Murray to Wellington. _Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. p. 200.\r\n\r\n[408] Napier blames the British Government for having got things into\r\nsuch a position of double command that Bentinck could withdraw from\r\nSpain troops which he had sent there, and which had passed under\r\nWellington’s authority (v. p. 54). Wellington seems to have made no\r\nobjection to this particular recall (_Dispatches_, vii. p. 260),\r\nthinking (I suppose) that the risk of losing Sicily was much more\r\nserious than the deduction of 2,000 men from the Alicante side-show.\r\nHe wrote at any rate to Murray to send them off at once, if he had not\r\ndone so already. The fault, of course, lay with Bentinck, for denuding\r\nSicily before he was sure of the stability of the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n[409] Murray to Wellington, April 2. _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii.\r\np. 605. The 6th K.G.L. was present at Castalla on April 13th.\r\n\r\n[410] Wellington, _Dispatches_, x. p. 162.\r\n\r\n[411] The best account of all this from the Spanish point of view is\r\na dispatch written by Colonel Potons y Moxica, Elio’s chief of the\r\nstaff, in the Record Office, ‘East Coast of Spain’ file. It is equally\r\nvaluable for the battle of Castalla.\r\n\r\n[412] Consisting of 2/27th British, Calabrese Free Corps, 1st Italian\r\nLevy, and the rifle companies of 3rd and 8th K.G.L.\r\n\r\n[413] Two squadrons 20th Light Dragoons, the troop of Foreign Hussars,\r\nand some of Whittingham’s Spaniards, two squadrons of Olivenza.\r\n\r\n[414] I do not know who was commanding this division (3rd of the\r\nMurcian army) in April: its divisional general, Sarsfield, was absent.\r\nIt included Bailen, Badajoz, America, Alpujarras, Corona, and Guadix:\r\nO’Ronan had it in the preceding autumn.\r\n\r\n[415] Potons y Moxica’s dispatch says that ‘la entrega del castillo\r\nprovino de una especie de sedicion en la tropa de Velez Malaga,’\r\nwhich is conclusive. Why Napier (v. 57) calls Velez Malaga ‘the\r\nfinest regiment in the Spanish army’ I cannot conceive. It was one of\r\nO’Donnell’s old regiments, cut to pieces at Castalla in the preceding\r\nJuly, and hastily filled up with drafts. I suspect that Napier is\r\nparaphrasing Suchet’s description of this corps as ‘mille hommes de\r\nbelles troupes.’ Except that they had been recently re-clothed from the\r\nBritish subsidy, there was nothing ‘fine’ about them.\r\n\r\n[416] In his own narrative he says that he sent in the 1st and 3rd\r\nLéger, 14th, 114th, and 121st Line--a big deployment of forces.\r\n\r\n[417] The best account of the combat of Biar is that of the anonymous\r\nofficer of the 2/27th, quoted at length by Trimble in his _History of\r\nthe Inniskilling Regiment_, pp. 61-2. See also the less trustworthy\r\nLandsheit (of the ‘Foreign Hussars’), ii. pp. 86-9.\r\n\r\n[418] De Roll-Dillon, 81st, and one of Whittingham’s Spanish\r\nbattalions. They had some casualties--the Spaniards 29, De Roll-Dillon\r\nprobably 25: its total casualty list for the days April 12-13 of 34\r\ncannot be divided between the two actions.\r\n\r\n[419] It is impossible to disentangle the losses of Adam’s brigade on\r\nApril 12 and April 13, given together in Murray’s report. But on the\r\nsecond day the 2/27th regiment was the only unit seriously engaged.\r\nThe total for both days was killed 1 officer and 56 men, wounded 10\r\nofficers and 231 men, missing 32 men: or a total of 330. If we _deduct_\r\n40 for assumed losses of the 2/27th on the second day, and 30 more for\r\ncasual losses of the other units on April 13--they were engaged but\r\nnot seriously--and _add_ 29 for losses in Whittingham’s battalion (he\r\ngives the figure himself) and 25 (including 9 missing) for those in De\r\nRoll-Dillon (which was barely under fire on the second day and lost 34\r\naltogether), we must conclude that the total was very close to 300.\r\n\r\n[420] The light company 7th K.G.L., two newly arrived squadrons of\r\nBrunswick Hussars, and two batteries.\r\n\r\n[421] 2/27th, Calabrese Free Corps, 1st Italian Levy, two light\r\ncompanies K.G.L.\r\n\r\n[422] 1/27th, 4th and 6th K.G.L., ‘Estero’ regiment (two battalions).\r\n\r\n[423] 1/10th, 1/58th, 1/81st British, composite battalion of De\r\nRoll-Dillon, 2nd Italian Levy.\r\n\r\n[424] Cordoba, Mallorca, Guadalajara, 2nd of Burgos, 2nd of Murcia, 5th\r\nGrenadiers.\r\n\r\n[425] Chinchilla, Canarias, Alicante, Cazadores de Valencia,\r\nVoluntarios de Aragon.\r\n\r\n[426] Two squadrons each of Olivenza and Almanza.\r\n\r\n[427] Napier, v. 58, quoting Donkin MSS., which are unpublished and\r\nunfindable.\r\n\r\n[428] Landsheit, ii. p. 91.\r\n\r\n[429] Suchet says that to support the voltigeurs he sent in only _four_\r\nbattalions of the 3rd Léger and 121st--but most undoubtedly the 114th\r\nattacked also, for it lost four officers killed and nine wounded, as\r\nmany as the 3rd Léger, and this means 250 casualties at least in the\r\nrank and file.\r\n\r\n[430] Whittingham, _Memoirs_, p. 197.\r\n\r\n[431] Mr. Fortescue (_British Army_, ix. p. 43) seems rather to lean to\r\nthe idea that the staff, or at any rate Catanelli, resolved to force\r\nMurray to fight despite of himself. This may have been the case.\r\n\r\n[432] Cordoba and 2nd of Burgos.\r\n\r\n[433] Guadalajara.\r\n\r\n[434] Murcia, Majorca, and 5th Grenadiers.\r\n\r\n[435] 1st Léger, in reserve on the Cerro del Doncel.\r\n\r\n[436] During which occurred the dramatic duel in front of the line\r\nbetween Captain Waldron and a French Grenadier officer mentioned in\r\nNapier, v. p. 59. The picturesqueness of the story induced some critics\r\nto doubt it. But there is no getting over the fact that Waldron gave\r\nhis opponent’s weapon, which was a sword of honour presented by the\r\nEmperor, to the Quartermaster-General (Donkin), who forwarded it to\r\nthe Duke of York, and the Commander-in-Chief gazetted Waldron to a\r\nbrevet-majority in consequence. (See Trimble’s _Historical Record\r\nof the 27th_, p. 64.) It is extremely odd (as Arteche remarks) that\r\nSuchet in his short and insincere account of Castalla tells a story\r\nof a _French_ officer who killed an English officer in single combat\r\n(_Mémoires_, ii. p. 308).\r\n\r\n[437] I am inclined to think the latter, as it is doubtful whether,\r\nwith the spur between, Adam’s fighting-ground was visible from\r\nWhittingham’s.\r\n\r\n[438] Taking Murray’s casualty list for comparison with Suchet’s, we\r\nfind that he had 4 officers killed and 16 wounded to 649 men at Biar\r\nand Castalla, i. e. 1 officer to 32 men. But this was an exceptionally\r\nlow proportion of officers lost. At such a rate Suchet might have lost\r\n2,000 men! I take 1,300 as a fair estimate.\r\n\r\n[439] Cf. Wellington, _Dispatches_, x. pp. 354-5, in which Wellington\r\nasks what sort of a victory was it, if Suchet was able to hold the pass\r\nof Biar, only two miles from the battlefield, till nightfall?\r\n\r\n[440] See Appendix on Castalla losses, English and French, at the end\r\nof the volume.\r\n\r\n[441] Six companies of Dillon came from Sicily, to replace the 2/67th\r\nat Cartagena.\r\n\r\n[442] Wellington to Dumouriez, _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii. 482-3,\r\nand to Cooke, ibid. pp. 477-8.\r\n\r\n[443] Wellington to Liverpool, November 23, 1812. _Dispatches_, ix. p.\r\n572.\r\n\r\n[444] Wellington to Graham, January 31. _Dispatches_, x. p. 67.\r\n\r\n[445] Wellington to Bathurst.

The foot companies were those of\r\nDubourdieu (1st Division), Maxwell (2nd Division), Douglas (3rd\r\nDivision), Sympher K.G.L. (4th Division), Lawson (5th Division),\r\nBrandreth (6th Division), Cairnes (7th Division). Tulloh’s Portuguese\r\ncompany was attached to the 2nd Division, Da Cunha’s to Silveira’s\r\ndivision. The reserve was composed of Webber-Smith’s H.A. troop,\r\nArriaga’s Portuguese heavy 18-pounders, and Parker’s foot company.

He acknowledges the loss of\r\nsome of Villatte’s guns, probably in error, for Wellington speaks\r\nof captured caissons only in his report of the affair. Martinien’s\r\nlist of casualties shows hardly any officer-casualties on this day in\r\nVillatte’s division.\r\n\r\n[470] See the elaborate dispatch of June 28 (to Hill, _Dispatches_, x.\r\npp. 402-4).\r\n\r\n[471] See Jourdan’s _Mémoires_, p. 466.\r\n\r\n[472] For all this see Wellington to Hill, _Dispatches_, x. pp. 402-4.\r\n\r\n[473] There are some slips either in the original or the copy of the\r\nMarching Orders printed in _Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. pp. 215-16.\r\nFor Carazedo, given on the itinerary of the 1st Division, is many miles\r\nfrom it, though it _is_ on the proper line of the 5th Division, which\r\nwas going to Outeiro and not to Braganza. Limão on the itinerary of the\r\n3rd Division should be Vinhas, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\n[474] Another odd error in Marching Orders given in _Wellington\r\nDispatches_, x. p. 368, had turned the Portuguese heavy guns into\r\ninfantry ‘18th Portuguese Brigade’ which should read ‘Portuguese\r\n18-pounder brigade.’ There was no higher numbered Portuguese infantry\r\nbrigade than the 10th.

Note that Napier (v. 102) has got\r\nthis expedition a week too late--May 29-30. His statement that the\r\nFrench cavalry got in touch with the northern wing of Graham’s army\r\nand was closely followed by British scouting parties, is contradicted\r\nby the absolute silence about any touch with the French in the diary\r\nof Tomkinson, whose regiment was at Tabara and must have been the one\r\nwhich Boyer would have met.\r\n\r\n[480] Digeon’s own report, which chanced to be entirely inaccurate, was\r\nthat on the 29th his reconnaissance reported that there were signs of\r\nintentions to throw trestle bridges across the Esla opposite the ford\r\nof Morellas, the lowest ford on the Esla toward the Douro, and at Santa\r\nEnferina opposite San Cebrian, where Spanish troops were visible. Also\r\nthat at Almendra there was a post of British hussars. Only the third\r\nitem was correct. (_Archives Nationaux_--copy lent me by Mr. Fortescue.)\r\n\r\n[481] Tomkinson says that his regiment, the 16th Light Dragoons,\r\nwas 20 hours on horseback this day, continually hurried off and\r\ncountermarching (p. 235).\r\n\r\n[482] Julian Sanchez’s lancers, from Hill’s wing, moving from\r\nPenauseude, got in the same night to Zamora.\r\n\r\n[483] Digeon has an elaborate and unconvincing account of this affair\r\nin the long dispatch quoted above. He says that he had two regiments\r\n(16th and 21st Dragoons) drawn up in front of a bridge and ravine,\r\nawaiting the return of a reconnaissance sent to Toro: that the\r\ndetachment arrived hotly pursued by British hussars, whereupon he\r\nresolved to retire, and told the brigade to file across the ravine. But\r\nthe 16th Dragoons charged without orders, in order to save the flying\r\nparty, and got engaged against fourfold numbers, while the 21st was\r\nretiring. They did wonders: killed or wounded 100 hussars, captured an\r\nofficer and 13 men, and retired fighting on the battery and infantry at\r\nPedroso, losing only 100 men.\r\n\r\n[484] Two officers of the 16th were taken: the lists in Martinien show\r\nonly one more officer wounded--from which we should gather that the\r\nresistance must have been poor. For a regiment fighting strongly should\r\nhave had more officer-casualties than three to 208 other ranks. The\r\n16th Dragoons must have been pretty well destroyed--with 1 officer and\r\n108 men unwounded prisoners, 1 officer and 100 men wounded prisoners,\r\nand 1 officer and an unknown number of other ranks wounded but not\r\ncaptured. This was the same regiment which had lost the 1 officer and\r\n32 men taken by their own carelessness at Val de Perdices on the 31st.\r\nIt had been less than 400 strong by its last preserved morning-state.\r\n\r\n[485] Jourdan, _Mémoires_, p. 463.\r\n\r\n[486] See above, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[487] 45th Ligne and 12th Léger.\r\n\r\n[488] 2nd Hussars, 5th and 10th _Chasseurs à Cheval_.

It must have been lent him long\r\nbefore it was printed in 1845.\r\n\r\n[529] Martinien’s lists show only 1 officer killed and 5 wounded this\r\nday in Maucune’s division--this means about 120-50 casualties, but of\r\ncourse does not include the unwounded prisoners from the baggage-guard.\r\nJourdan says that the division had ‘une perte assez considérable.’\r\n\r\n[530] See _Vie militaire du Général Foy_, pp. 206-7.\r\n\r\n[531] _Vie militaire du Général Foy_, p. 206. The editor, Girod de\r\nl’Ain, seems to prove that Foy got no other dispatch, though Jourdan\r\ndeclares that several had been sent to him.\r\n\r\n[532] It would appear, however, that though the 1st and 5th Divisions\r\nand Anson’s cavalry never went near Orduña, yet Bradford and Pack’s\r\nPortuguese (without artillery) had got so near it on the preceding day\r\nthat Wellington let them go through it, bringing them back to the main\r\nbody via Unza by a mountain path. See _Supplementary Dispatches_, vii.\r\np. 647.\r\n\r\n[533] Probably by Angulo, and the valley of the Gordajuela.\r\n\r\n[534] He says so in his letter to the Conde d’Abispal, _Dispatches_, x.\r\npp. 445-6. ‘Je les attaquerai demain, _s’ils ne font pas la retraite\r\ndans la nuit_.’\r\n\r\n[535] Napier, v. p. 114.\r\n\r\n[536] There is a good account of the skirmish on the Bayas in Wachholz,\r\np. 314. He remarks on the abominable weather, ‘incredible for the time\r\nof year--continuous unbearable cold and rain--the sun visible only for\r\nshort intervals. Very bad roads.’\r\n\r\n[537] For all this see Tomkinson’s _Diary_, p. 243. His statement that\r\nthe column went off on the Orduña road by _mistake_ and was at once set\r\nright, seems to me conclusive against Napier’s views.\r\n\r\n[538] An English eye-witness calls it ‘nowhere fordable’: a French\r\neye-witness ‘fordable everywhere’; both are wrong.

But we hear of the 3rd Line defending Gamarra\r\nMenor in one French report, a fact corroborated by its showing two\r\nofficer-casualties in Martinien’s lists--the guns are mentioned in\r\nTirlet’s artillery report. Cavalry of the Army of the North is vaguely\r\nmentioned--its presence seems established by an officer-casualty of the\r\n15th Chasseurs in Martinien. I suspect the presence of part of the 10th\r\nLéger, which has an officer-casualty, Vittoria _22nd_ June, presumably\r\na misprint for 21st.\r\n\r\n[555] _Dispatches_, x. p. 449, says that Reille had two _divisions_ in\r\nreserve (they were only two _brigades_) in addition to his front line\r\nholding the bridges: and cf. x. p. 450, which says directly that four\r\ndivisions of Reille’s army were present.\r\n\r\n[556] Here comes in a curious incident, illustrating the extraordinary\r\ncarelessness of the French Staff. Gazan was very anxious to get\r\nrestored to him an artillery officer, a Captain Cheville, then a\r\nprisoner. As an exchange for him he sent into the British lines on the\r\n20th, Captain Leith Hay, a captured British intelligence officer, who\r\nhad been with the Army of the South for a month, and had witnessed the\r\nwhole retreat, during which he had been freely in intercourse with\r\nGeneral Maransin and many staff officers. On his release he was able to\r\ntell Wellington that the French were definitely halted, and expected\r\nto fight. Why exchange such a prisoner on such a day? See Leith Hay,\r\nii. p. 190. Cf. _Wellington Dispatches_, x. p. 443, which corroborates\r\nHay’s story.\r\n\r\n[557] Jourdan, _Mémoires_, p. 475.\r\n\r\n[558] Digeon had obstructed the bridges of Arriaga and Gamarra. The\r\nbridge of Villodas, below Gazan’s extreme right, had been partly\r\nbarricaded. Not so Nanclares, Mendoza, and the bridge immediately below\r\nTres Puentes.\r\n\r\n[559] Diary of the 43rd officer, in Maxwell, ii. p. 40.\r\n\r\n[560] There is a good account of the heroic death of Cadogan, a\r\nmuch-loved colonel of the 71st, in the diary of his quarter-master,\r\nWilliam Gavin, of the same regiment. When aware that he was mortally\r\nhit, Cadogan refused to be moved from the field, and had himself\r\npropped up against two knapsacks, on a point from which his dying eyes\r\ncould survey the whole field, and watched the fight to the bitter end.\r\n\r\n[561] From Gazan’s report in the French Archives, written at St.\r\nJean-Pied-du-Port in July--very much _ex post facto_. It was lent me by\r\nMr. Fortescue, along with several other Vittorian documents.\r\n\r\n[562] Diary of Cooke of the 43rd in Maxwell’s _Peninsular Sketches_,\r\nii. 42.\r\n\r\n[563] Graham’s Report, _Wellington Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. 7-8.\r\n\r\n[564] Cooke, the 43rd officer in Maxwell’s _Peninsular Sketches_,\r\nii. 44. The guns were undoubtedly the Horse Artillery battery on the\r\nhigh-road in front of Gazan’s centre.\r\n\r\n[565] Of course, Cooke is understating the distance, which was about a\r\nquarter of a mile.\r\n\r\n[566] This interesting narrative of Captain Cooke of the 43rd must have\r\nbeen in Napier’s hands before it was printed by Maxwell, as several\r\nphrases from it are repeated in Napier, vol. v, p. 121. Sir William\r\nhimself was in England that day.\r\n\r\n[567] He was, along with Stewart and Oswald, one of the three\r\ndivisional generals who committed the gross breach of orders during the\r\nBurgos retreat mentioned above, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[568] Cf. Burgoyne, _Life and Letters_, i. 263 (June 23, 1813), with\r\nPicton’s letters in _Wellington Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. 225,\r\nabout ‘the 3rd Division being kept in the background, for Sir T. P. is\r\nby no means a favourite with Lord W.’ Cairnes (in Dickson, ed. Leslie)\r\nputs the change down as ‘most mortifying to Picton’.\r\n\r\n[569] See Dalhousie to Wellington, in _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii.\r\np. 6, which leaves much unsaid.\r\n\r\n[570] Narrative of one of Picton’s staff in Robinson’s _Life of\r\nPicton_, ii. 195-6.\r\n\r\n[571] The third battery originally at Ariñez was Villatte’s divisional\r\nbattery, which had gone off with him to the Puebla heights. Neither P.\r\nSoult nor Treillard had guns with them.\r\n\r\n[572] Such turning _might_ have been done either by the two belated\r\nbrigades of the 7th Division or by troops detached by Graham, who had\r\nseveral brigades to spare, which he never used, but might have sent to\r\npass the Zadorra at the bridge of Yurre or the fords west of it, both\r\nwell behind the new French line.\r\n\r\n[573] Who was this officer? _Not_ Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Cother of the\r\n71st nor Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Harrison of the 50th. Hope of the 92nd,\r\nin his rather detailed narrative of this fight, calls him ‘Colonel\r\nR----.’ I cannot identify him. Conceivably, it may have been Colonel\r\nRooke, the senior officer of Hill’s staff who _may_ have been sent\r\nup the heights, and _may_ have taken over command on Cadogan’s being\r\nmortally wounded.\r\n\r\n[574] So says the anonymous but invaluable ‘T. S.’ of the 71st.\r\nLeith Hay, a prisoner with the French in this campaign, remarks that\r\nthey were all in their summer wear of long linen overcoats, with the\r\ncross-belts put on above.\r\n\r\n[575] They were released at Pampeluna on the surrender of that fortress\r\nthree months later, in a state of semi-starvation, having been carried\r\non with Villatte’s division during the French retreat. They described\r\nto Gavin of the 71st, who happened to be present at the surrender,\r\ntheir unhappy fortunes. See his diary, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[576] Gazan’s most unconvincing account of all this engagement is that\r\n‘General Villatte attacked the enemy with his usual vigour: nothing\r\ncould resist the shock of his division. The position, whose recapture\r\nought to have assured us the victory, was retaken, as well as the\r\nheight in front of Subijana. The enemy was routed at every point. Such\r\nwas the position of the Army of the South, when news came to the King\r\nthat our troops by the Zadorra were attacked, and could not maintain\r\nthemselves. I was told to break off my attack and retire to a position\r\nfurther back.’\r\n\r\n[577] The 71st lost, beside their well-loved colonel--the only man\r\nmentioned in Wellington’s private letter of next morning to his brother\r\nHenry (_Dispatches_, x. p. 454)--44 killed, 272 wounded, and nearly 40\r\nprisoners: half the battalion. The 50th lost only 7 officers and 97\r\nmen; the 92nd no more than 20 men. If Villatte gave correct figures,\r\nhis total loss was only 2 officers and 289 men--including 22 prisoners.\r\nOf these the 63rd, obviously the leading regiment, was responsible\r\nfor 135 casualties, the 95th for 94. The other two regiments had\r\npractically no losses. These figures are very low, but seem to be\r\ncorroborated by Martinien.\r\n\r\n[578] Its heavy loss of 33 officers and 515 men out of about 2,200\r\npresent was nearly all, I believe, suffered at this point. The 2/87th\r\nwith 244 casualties out of about 600 present lost 40 per cent. of its\r\nstrength. Chassé’s French brigade, the immediate opponents, had 800\r\ncasualties, nearly all at this moment.\r\n\r\n[579] Why did not Dalhousie support Colville more promptly? He had a\r\nbridge to cross, and some way to go, but was evidently late.\r\n\r\n[580] These details come mainly out of the _Mémoire sur la Retraite des\r\nArmées françaises_ in the French Archives, lent me by Mr. Fortescue.\r\nInternal evidence shows it written by some member of D’Erlon’s staff.\r\nTirlet’s report is also useful.\r\n\r\n[581] Captured by skirmishers of the 1/95th, as it was retreating up\r\nthe high road and was nearing Ariñez. The French infantry recovered\r\nit for a moment by a counter-stroke, but as the Riflemen had cut the\r\ntraces and shot or removed the horses, they could not get the gun away.\r\nTirlet says the battery lost only _one_ gun, which is corroborated by\r\nCostello of the 95th, present on the spot. Kincaid and other Riflemen\r\nsay three.\r\n\r\n[582] There is a curious problem connected with a correspondence\r\n(_Dispatches_, x. pp. 329-31) between Picton and Wellington on July\r\n16--three weeks after the battle. Wellington apparently thought that\r\nPicton blamed the 88th for losing Ariñez in the first assault, while\r\nit was really only two companies of the 1/95th which had entered that\r\nvillage and been driven out. He says that he had seen the 88th coming\r\ninto action in a very ragged line, and had himself halted them and\r\ndressed their front, before he let them go on: after this he did not\r\nnotice what became of them, but saw them again after the fighting\r\nformed on the other side of the village.\r\n\r\nWhat Wellington did not witness is chronicled by Costello of the\r\n1/95th: after describing the repulse of the Riflemen, he notes their\r\npleasure at seeing ‘our favourite third division’ coming down the road.\r\nAriñez was promptly retaken and the advance recommenced. ‘I noticed\r\na regiment, which by its yellow facings was the Connaught Rangers,\r\nmarching in close column of companies to attack a French regiment drawn\r\nup in line on the verge of the hill, with a small village [Gomecha?]\r\nin its rear. The 88th, although under a heavy cannonade from the\r\nenemy’s artillery, continued advancing gallantly, while we skirmishers\r\ntook ground to the left, close to the road, in order to allow them to\r\noppose this line in front. Though we were hotly engaged I watched their\r\nmovements. The 88th next deployed into line, advancing all the time\r\ntowards their opponents, who seemed to wait very coolly for them. When\r\nthey had approached within 300 yards the French poured in a volley,\r\nor I should rather say a running fire from right to left. As soon as\r\nthe British regiment recovered the first shock, and closed their files\r\non the gap that had been made, they commenced advancing at double\r\ntime till within fifty yards nearer to the enemy, when they halted\r\nand in turn gave a running fire from the whole line, and then without\r\na moment’s pause, cheered and charged up the hill against them. The\r\nFrench meanwhile were attempting to reload. But they were hard pressed\r\nby the British, who gave them no time for a second volley. They went\r\nimmediately to the right about, making the best of their way to the\r\nvillage behind.’\r\n\r\nFrom this it is clear that the 88th fought on open ground, to the\r\nright of Ariñez and the high road. It was the centre regiment of the\r\nbrigade: the 45th, therefore, must have been more to the right and well\r\nsouth of the road; the 74th on the high road were the actual takers of\r\nAriñez. We have unluckily no description of Power’s Portuguese at the\r\nmoment--but they lost heavily--the casualties being 25 officers and 386\r\nmen. They _must_ have been engaged with Leval’s 2nd Brigade, which had\r\nbeen stationed about and to the north of Gomecha, while the 1st Brigade\r\nheld the village of Ariñez and the hill behind.\r\n\r\n[583] The amusing story told of this storm by Harry Smith in his\r\nautobiography (i. pp. 97-8) is too good to be omitted. ‘My brigade\r\nwas sent to support the 7th Division, which was hotly engaged. I was\r\nsent forward to report to Lord Dalhousie, who commanded. I found his\r\nlordship and his Q.M.G. Drake in deep conversation. I reported pretty\r\nquick, and asked for orders (the head of the brigade was just getting\r\nunder fire). I repeated the question, “What orders, my lord?” Drake\r\nbecame somewhat animated, and I heard his lordship say, “Better take\r\nthe village.” I roared out, “Certainly, my lord,” and off I galloped,\r\nboth calling to me to come back, but “none are so deaf as those who\r\nwon’t hear.” I told General Vandeleur we were immediately to take the\r\nvillage. The 52nd deployed into line, our Riflemen were sent out in\r\nevery direction, keeping up a fire nothing could resist.... The 52nd\r\nin line and the swarm of Riflemen rushed at the village, and though\r\nthe ground was intersected by gardens and ditches nothing ever checked\r\nus, until we reached the rear of it. There was never a more impetuous\r\nonset--nothing could resist such a burst of determination.’ Smith’s\r\naddition that the brigade took twelve guns in this charge seems (as Mr.\r\nFortescue remarks) to be of more doubtful value.\r\n\r\nNaturally there is nothing of this in Dalhousie’s dispatch--a most\r\ndisappointing paper. It is mostly in a self-exculpatory tone, to\r\njustify his lateness and the absence of his two rear brigades. He\r\n_says_ that they came up at the same time as Vandeleur, which is\r\ncertainly untrue, as neither of them had a single casualty all day.\r\nAnd they could not have failed to catch a shell or two if they had\r\nbeen anywhere near the fighting-line during the subsequent capture\r\nof Crispijana and Zuazo. Mr. Fortescue’s note that Captain Cairnes’s\r\nletter in the _Dickson Papers_, p. 916, proves that Barnes’s brigade\r\nhad arrived by this time, is a misdeduction from Cairnes’s carelessness\r\nin talking of Grant’s brigade as ‘our first brigade,’ meaning thereby\r\nour leading brigade, not the brigade officially numbered 1. When\r\nCairnes says that the ‘first brigade’ and the guns were ‘in their\r\nplace,’ while the rest arrived very late in the action, we need only\r\ncontrast the casualty lists--1st Brigade _nil_, 2nd Brigade 330\r\ncasualties, 3rd Brigade _nil_, to see what he means.\r\n\r\n[584] It will be noticed that I put La Hermandad as the village where\r\nthe heavy fighting took place, and which Vandeleur’s brigade stormed.\r\nAll historians up to now have followed Napier in making Margarita the\r\nimportant place. A glance at the map will show that the latter village\r\nis too far forward to have been held for any time, after Leval had\r\nevacuated his original position on the great knoll facing Tres Puentes\r\nand Villodas.\r\n\r\nI have to point out that neither Wellington nor Lord Dalhousie\r\nin the two contemporary dispatches (_Dispatches_, x. p. 451, and\r\n_Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. pp. 4-6) mention either place by\r\nname--only speaking of ‘a village.’ D’Erlon’s staff-officer in the\r\nreport of the Army of the Centre says that Margarita was held for some\r\ntime but was rendered untenable by Leval’s retreat--so that Darmagnac\r\nhad to go back to the heights behind. Gazan’s report says that the\r\nBritish were masters of Margarita before he took up his position on\r\nthe heights above Ariñez, and that the _heights behind Margarita_\r\nwere the fighting position of D’Erlon. Of the diarists or chroniclers\r\nwho issued their books _before the fifth volume of Napier_ came out,\r\nand who were present on this part of the field, Green (68th), Wheeler\r\n(51st), Captain Wood (82nd), mention no village names, nor do Lord\r\nGough’s and Captain Cairnes’s contemporary letters, nor Geo. Simmons’\r\ncontemporary diary. Nor does Sir Harry Smith’s amusing account of his\r\ndealings with Lord Dalhousie before ‘the village’ which Vandeleur took\r\n(_Autobiography_, i. pp. 97-8) quoted in the preceding note.\r\n\r\nAfter Napier’s book stated that the Light Division battalions took\r\nMargarita, and Gough with the 2/87th La Hermandad (a reversal of the\r\nreal time and facts as I think), most later writers accepted these\r\nstatements as gospel. But the report of Kruse, commanding the Nassau\r\nregiment, absolutely proves that Napier is wrong. Moreover, the rough\r\nmap, annexed to D’Erlon’s original report of the battle in the French\r\nArchives, gives Hermandad as the position of Darmagnac, with his march\r\nthither _from_ Gomecha and _to_ Zuazo indicated by arrows. Kruse’s\r\nreport may be found at length in the Nassau volume of Saussez’s _Les\r\nAllemands sous les Aigles_, pp. 340-1.\r\n\r\n[585] This British claim is corroborated by the narrative of the French\r\nsurgeon Fée, present at Abechuco that day.\r\n\r\n[586] Though he had lost several when La Martinière was driven out of\r\nGamarra Mayor (see above, p. 425) and Abechuco.\r\n\r\n[587] The other regiments of Hay’s brigade were evidently kept in\r\nreserve, for the casualties of the 1/38th were eight only, and those\r\nof the 1/9th 25. The 8th Caçadores of Spry’s brigade lost 40 men, the\r\nPortuguese Line battalions only 41 between the four of them.\r\n\r\n[588] Sergeant James Hale of the 1/9th, who has left us the only good\r\ndetailed account of the fighting at Gamarra with which I am acquainted\r\n(pp. 105-6).\r\n\r\n[589] Numbers impossible to determine, as they are never borne in the\r\nmuster rolls of the Army of the Centre. But as they were 2,019 strong\r\non July 16, when Soult reorganized the whole Army of Spain, they were\r\nprobably 2,500 strong before the battle.\r\n\r\n[590] So Tirlet, making allowances for the lost pieces.\r\n\r\n[591] Viz. the divisional batteries of the 2nd Division (one British,\r\none Portuguese), 3rd, 4th, 7th, Light, and Silveira’s Divisions, two H.\r\nA. batteries attached to the cavalry, two British and one Portuguese\r\nbatteries of the reserve, and three Spanish guns belonging to Morillo.\r\n\r\n[592] These notes are partly from Tirlet’s very interesting artillery\r\nreport, partly from the narrative of the staff-officer of the Army of\r\nthe Centre, already often quoted above.\r\n\r\n[593] See tables of losses in Appendices, nos. xi and xii.\r\n\r\n[594] _Memoirs_, p. 479.\r\n\r\n[595] _Diary_ of Wachholz, attached with a Brunswick light company to\r\nthe 4th Division, pp. 315-16.\r\n\r\n[596] Thirty guns according to Garbé’s report--40 according to that of\r\nD’Erlon’s staff-officer, quoted above.\r\n\r\n[597] Blaze, p. 244.\r\n\r\n[598] What regiment was this? Obviously one of Colville’s or\r\nGrant’s--as obviously not the 51st, 68th, 82nd, 87th, 94th, from all\r\nof which we have narratives of the battle, which do not mention their\r\nbeing charged by cavalry or forming square. There remain the _Chasseurs\r\nBritanniques_, 1/5th, 2/83rd--it may have been any of these.\r\n\r\n[599] Tomkinson of the 16th, fighting not far off, says that these\r\nsquadrons ‘got into a scrape’ by charging about 2,000 French cavalry\r\n(p. 249). They lost 2 officers and 57 men. This was obviously the\r\naffair of which Digeon speaks. His 12th Dragoons, which charged the\r\nsquare, lost 22 casualties.\r\n\r\n[600] One each of the 12th and 16th.\r\n\r\n[601] The best account of all this is in the invaluable Tomkinson’s\r\n_Diary_ (pp. 250-1). There is also an interesting narrative by Dallas,\r\nwho took part in the charge, though he had no business there (pp.\r\n92-3). The French cavalry were the 15th Dragoons and 3rd Hussars.\r\nThey suffered heavily--the former regiment losing 4 officers and 53\r\nmen, the latter 4 officers and 30 men. The British dragoons got off\r\nlightly, all things considered, with 1 officer and 11 men hit in the\r\n12th, and 1 officer and 20 men in the 10th. Tomkinson much praises the\r\nFrench infantry. ‘I never saw men more steady and exact to the word of\r\ncommand. I rode within a yard of them, they had their arms at the port,\r\nand not a man attempted to fire till we began to retire.’\r\n\r\n[602] Cf. the reports of the Army of Portugal, Tomkinson, Hale of the\r\n1/9th, and Graham’s very sketchy dispatch, which says that the infantry\r\nwas much delayed at the bridges, but that ‘the greatest eagerness was\r\nmanifested by all the corps. The Caçador battalions of both Portuguese\r\nbrigades followed with the cavalry.... The enemy’s flight, however,\r\nwas so rapid that no material impression could be made on them, though\r\nmore than once charged by squadrons of General Anson’s brigade.’\r\n(_Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 9.)\r\n\r\n[603] Gazan says in his report that he only abandoned the guns because\r\nhe found the roads south of Vittoria blocked by fugitive vehicles from\r\nVittoria.\r\n\r\n[604] L’Estrange of the 31st says that some of the French, moving\r\nalmost in the middle of advancing British brigades, were mistaken for\r\nSpaniards, and allowed to get off unharmed. Surtees of the 2/95th tells\r\na similar story.\r\n\r\n[605] The lancers are shown in Martinien’s lists to have lost six\r\nofficers, the hussars four. The casualties of the 18th Hussars (3\r\nofficers and 37 men) and of the 10th (16 men) were certainly got in\r\nthis affair, which was evidently hot while it lasted. The best account\r\nof Joseph’s last half-hour on the battlefield is in the _Mémoires_ of\r\nMiot de Melito (iii. pp. 280-1), who was at the King’s side and shared\r\nhis wild ride.\r\n\r\n[606] Of the artillery Tirlet’s report shows that 104 were field guns\r\nactually used in the battle. The remaining 47 were partly the reserve\r\nguns of the Army of the North, left stacked at Vittoria when Clausel\r\ntook his divisions to hunt for Mina, and partly guns of position from\r\nthe garrisons of Burgos, Vittoria, Miranda, &c.\r\n\r\n[607] There is a report of the regiment in the _Archives Nationales_\r\nsetting forth that it did not lose its eagle, but the flag of the\r\nbattalion reduced by Imperial orders in the spring, which was in the\r\nregimental fourgon.\r\n\r\n[608] It inspired him with the idea of designing a British marshal’s\r\nbaton on which lions were substituted for eagles. Wellington naturally\r\ngot the first ever made.\r\n\r\n[609] All this from Leith Hay (always an interesting narrator), vol.\r\nii. pp. 203 and 208.\r\n\r\n[610] Oddly enough, two contemporary diaries mention Mr. D.’s luck.\r\nHe got by no means the biggest haul. Sergeant Costello of the 1/95th\r\nsays that he got over £1,000. A private of the 23rd carried off 1,000\r\ndollars in silver--a vast load! Green of the 68th records that two of\r\nhis comrades got respectively 180 doubloons, and nearly 1,000 dollars\r\n(p. 165).\r\n\r\n[611] Tomkinson, p. 254.\r\n\r\n[612] Miot de Melito, iii. p. 279.\r\n\r\n[613] There are amusing accounts of the conversation of this lively\r\nlady in the narratives of Leith Hay and Dr. McGrigor, who took care of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n[614] But Lecor had a straggler or two out of one of his\r\nline-battalions--no doubt men who had gone off marauding, like most of\r\nthe missing in the British list.\r\n\r\n[615] _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 8.\r\n\r\n[616] See e. g. Swabey’s note on his dangerous ride with Graham along\r\nthe Esla, at the end of May, ‘whether the General is blind or mad I\r\nhave not decided--he must have been one or the other to ride in cold\r\nblood over those rocks and precipices.’ Swabey’s _Diary_, p. 595.\r\n\r\n[617] Cairnes’s _Diary_, p. 926.\r\n\r\n[618] Fée, _Souvenirs de la guerre d’Espagne_, pp. 249-50.\r\n\r\n[619] He is thinking of the nights after the storms of Rodrigo and\r\nBadajoz.\r\n\r\n[620] _Dispatches_, xii. p. 473.

See Vidal de la\r\nBlache, i. p. 79.\r\n\r\n[633] Which had relieved Cassagne’s division, the rearguard on the 23rd.\r\n\r\n[634] The regiment of Nassau alone returned 76 casualties that day.\r\n\r\n[635] And took over command on the night of the 22nd; see _Pakenham\r\nLetters_, June 26, 1813.\r\n\r\n[636] Whose riotous and undisciplined conduct so irritated Wellington\r\nthat he directed that all the officers in charge should miss their next\r\nstep in regimental promotion, by being passed over by their juniors.\r\n\r\n[637] I have only mentioned the movement of the 6th Division and R.\r\nHill’s cavalry above: there is no doubt as to what they did, and on\r\nthe 30th they are both at Lerin, according to the location given by\r\n_Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 39. But there is a puzzle about\r\nOswald’s 5th Division on the 26th-30th, which I was long unable to\r\nsolve. Wellington in his dispatch to Bathurst of July 3 (_Dispatches_,\r\nx. p. 501) says that he moved not only Clinton from Vittoria but\r\nOswald from Salvatierra towards Logroño, on the march to intercept\r\nClausel. He ought to have known if any one did! But I was not able to\r\nfind any trace of the 5th Division having actually gone to Logroño:\r\nto march back from Salvatierra to Vittoria, and thence to follow\r\nClinton to Logroño and Lerin would have been a very long business. Now\r\nregimental diaries of the 3/1st and 1/9th prove that the division was\r\nat Salvatierra on the 25th, and marched back to Vittoria on the 26th.\r\nBut the best of them (Hale of the 1/9th) says that from Vittoria the\r\ndivision was turned back towards Pampeluna, and reached a spot within\r\ntwo leagues of it on the third day. At this point it was turned off\r\nnorthward and marched by Tolosa to join Graham’s column and assist at\r\nthe siege of St. Sebastian. All accounts agree that it reached the\r\nneighbourhood of that fortress on July 5th-6th. Allowing six days for\r\nthe march Vittoria-St. Sebastian, we have only the 27th, 28th, 29th,\r\n30th June for the supposed march Salvatierra-Vittoria-Logroño, and\r\nreturn. The solution at last came to hand in General Shadwell’s Life\r\nof Colin Campbell of the 1/9th (Lord Clyde). Here it is mentioned,\r\napparently on some record of Campbell’s, that his brigade only got to\r\nLa Guardia, one march beyond Trevino, and was then turned back and sent\r\nnorth (_Life of Campbell_, i. p. 18). This is no doubt correct.\r\n\r\n[638] _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 33.\r\n\r\n[639] Wellington’s letters to Hill, Copons, and Castaños in\r\n_Dispatches_, x. pp. 470-1, all state very shortly that he hopes to cut\r\noff Clausel if he tries to get back into France by Jaca. All that is\r\nsaid is, ‘I do not think we shall be able to do much against Clausel.\r\nHe has passed Tudela on the way to Saragossa. I propose to try for him\r\non the road to Jaca’ (to Hill). The letters to the Spanish generals do\r\nnot speak of Clausel’s going through Saragossa, but of his marching\r\nacross Aragon to Jaca.\r\n\r\n[640] See ‘Dispositions for the 28th June,’ _Supplementary Dispatches_,\r\nviii. p. 33.\r\n\r\n[641] Wellington to Castaños, Monreal, June 30, _Dispatches_, x. p.\r\n477, and to Bathurst, x. p. 496 and ibid. 501.\r\n\r\n[642] Elaborate dispositions for their distribution round the fortress\r\nare given in the Order dated June 30 (_Supplementary Dispatches_, viii.\r\npp. 34-6).\r\n\r\n[643] See above, p. 378. For all the narrative which follows Foy’s\r\nwell-written dispatches, printed in full in his life by Girod de l’Ain,\r\nare a primary authority. But I think that historians have given him a\r\nlittle more credit than he deserves--he is a very engaging witness. As\r\nto his own strength, that of his enemies, and the losses on both sides,\r\nhe is no more trustworthy than Soult or Masséna. It may suffice to say\r\nthat he makes the British 4th and 5th Divisions present at Tolosa, and\r\ngives Longa 6,000 men.\r\n\r\n[644] Foy to Jourdan, 20 June, in Girod de l’Ain’s appendix, pp. 393-4.\r\n\r\n[645] Batteries of Smith and Arriaga. Julius Hartmann, commanding\r\nArtillery Reserve, accompanied them; see _Dickson Papers_, June 22.\r\n\r\n[646] From the journal of operations of General Giron’s Army, lent me\r\nby Colonel Arzadun.\r\n\r\n[647] In his _Diary_ (Girod de l’Ain, p. 210) Foy says that he had only\r\n_one_ battalion of the 6th Léger, in his formal dispatch to Clarke\r\n(ibid. 395) he says that he had two.\r\n\r\n[648] In reporting to Giron Longa mentions his 53 prisoners, and says\r\nthat his own losses were ‘inconsiderable.’ _Journal of the Army of\r\nGalicia_, June 22.\r\n\r\n[649] _Journal of the Army of Galicia_, June 23.\r\n\r\n[650] Maucune reported 200 casualties (Foy, ed. Girod de l’Ain, p.\r\n333), Graham 93, mostly in the 5th Caçadores. St. Pol’s Italians had\r\nbeaten off Longa without losing more than 100 men--Giron does not give\r\nLonga’s loss, which was probably a little more.\r\n\r\n[651] 1st Division about 4,500 bayonets, Pack and Bradford 4,500,\r\nAnson’s cavalry 650.\r\n\r\n[652] Giron’s two Galician divisions 11,000, Porlier 2,500, Longa 3,000.\r\n\r\n[653] His own division and Maucune’s about 3,000 each, St. Pol’s\r\nItalians 1,500, garrisons from Bilbao, Durango, and other western\r\nplaces about 3,000, De Conchy’s brigade of Army of the North [64th (2\r\nbattalions), 22nd (1 battalion), 1st Line (2 companies), and 34th (4\r\ncompanies)] 2,000, garrisons of Tolosa and other places in Guipuzcoa\r\nabout 2,500.\r\n\r\n[654] Girod de l’Ain, p. 400.\r\n\r\n[655] This was merely the noise of the rearguard action of Cassagne\r\nwith Wellington’s advance, near Yrurzun, on the afternoon of that day.\r\n\r\n[656] See above, p. 274.\r\n\r\n[657] The column was led--for reasons which are not given--not by its\r\nown Caçador battalion, but by three companies of the 4th Caçadores and\r\ntwo of the 1st Line, borrowed from the neighbouring brigade of Pack.\r\nGraham praises the conduct of this detachment.\r\n\r\n[658] Foy (Girod de l’Ain, p. 400) says that if his orders had been\r\nobeyed there would have been a battalion and not a detachment holding\r\nthe access to the hill. Graham (_Wellington Supplementary Dispatches_,\r\nviii. p. 44) declares that though many of Bradford’s men fought well,\r\n‘the officers did not seem to understand what they were about, or how\r\nto keep their men in the proper place,’ and a good many hung back.\r\n\r\n[659] Very different figures from those of Foy’s dispatch, which stated\r\nthat eight minutes of terrible fire laid low 500 of the assailants!\r\n(Girod de l’Ain, p. 402).\r\n\r\n[660] There is one paragraph of Foy’s dispatch which I cannot make out.\r\nHe says that two British regiments tried to storm the hill of Jagoz,\r\nand were repulsed by the voltigeur companies alone of the brigade\r\nwhich held it. I cannot fit this in to any British narrative--the\r\nonly red-coated battalions in that part of the field were the line\r\nbattalions of the K.G.L., and they had certainly been engaged against\r\nBonté and the Italians, and afterwards tried to storm the Pampeluna\r\nGate. Longa’s men only were opposite the Jagoz position, as far as I\r\ncan make out.\r\n\r\n[661] For all this see Rey’s letter in the _Pièces justificatives_ of\r\nBelmas’s History of Sieges in Spain, iv. p. 662.\r\n\r\n[662] Under General Deconchy, who got a new brigade when his old one\r\nwas thrown into San Sebastian.\r\n\r\n[663] Dubourdieu’s battery belonging to the British 1st Division, and\r\nfour guns of Giron’s own small artillery equipment.\r\n\r\n[664] Lecestre’s _Lettres inédites de Napoléon_, ii. p. 265.\r\n\r\n[665] Severoli reached Valencia on May 2 (Vacani, vi. p. 207), so\r\nwas not drawn down in consequence of Murray’s move of May 25, as Mr.\r\nFortescue seems to imply in _British Army_, ix. p. 49. He had with him\r\ntwo battalions each of the 1st Line and 1st Ligero, with a weak cavalry\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n[666] 2nd of Burgos, detached by Wellington’s order. See Murray’s\r\n_Court Martial_, p. 371.\r\n\r\n[667] These changes of units had caused some re-brigading. Murray\r\nhad transferred the 4th K.G.L. and the Sicilian ‘Estero’ regiment\r\nto Clinton’s division, but taken away from the latter and given to\r\nMackenzie the 2nd Italian Levy, the 1/10th and the 1/81st. But Clinton\r\nwas given charge over Whittingham’s Spaniards, and authorized to use\r\nthem as part of his division, so that his total command was now much\r\nlarger than Mackenzie’s.\r\n\r\n[668] Pontevedra and Principe.\r\n\r\n[669] It is interesting to compare the May 31 morning state of the Army\r\nof Catalonia with the list of battalions which Murray reports as having\r\nbeen brought down to the neighbourhood of Tarragona. All are there save\r\ntwo (Fernando 7th and Ausona) left at Vich under Eroles (see Table in\r\nAppendix), twelve battalions were with Copons.\r\n\r\n[670] One of the 20th Line, one of the 7th Italian Line.\r\n\r\n[671] Not only was the whole of the enceinte of the lower city\r\nabandoned, but the outer enceinte of the upper city on its east and\r\nnorth sides, from the bastion of El Rey to that of La Reyna (see map of\r\nTarragona, p. 524 of vol. iv).\r\n\r\n[672] _Court Martial Proceedings_, p. 228.

The hussars\r\nwere 650 sabres--adding the squadron of dragoons (200), the gunners of\r\nthree batteries, train, &c.; the whole may have made just under 8,000\r\nof all arms.

He also doubled Suchet’s\r\ncavalry, by supposing that the 9th bis of Hussars and the 12th Hussars\r\nwere two separate regiments.

But 13 out of the 14 cavalry regiments of the\r\nArmy of the South remained behind.\r\n\r\n[744] Chassé’s brigade lost 850 men of 1,700 present, and the Nassau\r\nregiment in the German brigade had similar casualties, though the Baden\r\nregiment got off more lightly.\r\n\r\n[745] It should be noted that Daricau’s 6th Division was now led by\r\nMaransin--its old commander having been badly wounded at Vittoria.\r\nMaransin’s late brigade, still extra-divisional as at Vittoria, had\r\nbeen made over to Gruardet.\r\n\r\n[746] Jourdan answered that it _was_ a false movement, but that on June\r\n29th he could not possibly foresee that the King would change his mind\r\nas to the destination of the Army of the South.

If we allow for\r\nsick and stragglers and other casual losses, they cannot possibly have\r\nhad 6,000 men in line on July 5.\r\n\r\n[751] All these absurd theories are to be found in Gazan’s reports to\r\nJourdan of July 4 and 5. See Vidal de la Blache, i. pp. 106-7.\r\n\r\n[752] The troops of the Army of the North which Foy had collected from\r\nthe Biscay garrisons, the brigades of Deconchy, Rouget, and Berlier of\r\nwhich we have heard so much in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\n[753] Foy, Lamartinière, Maucune and Fririon (late Sarrut).

The total losses having been 124 on all\r\nthree days, Wellington’s ‘no loss’ means, of course, practically no\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n[755] The clearest proof of Gazan’s resolute resolve not to stand,\r\nand of the complete mendacity of his dispatches concerning his heavy\r\nfighting on the 4th-5th and 7th, is that he returned the total of his\r\nlosses at 35 killed and 309 wounded. As he had six brigades, or 13,000\r\nmen at least, engaged, it is clear that there was no serious fighting\r\nat all--a fact borne out by Hill’s corresponding return of 8 killed,\r\n119 wounded, and 2 missing in the whole petty campaign.\r\n\r\n[756] Cf.

He knew from Jones that they were Caçadores\r\nonly (Jones, ii. p. 21), and that their loss was under 70.\r\n\r\n[800] Right column, to attack the cemetery and fortified houses--150 of\r\n5th Caçadores, 150 13th Portuguese Line, three companies 1/9th Foot,\r\nthree companies 3/1st Foot (Royal Scots) all under Hay, Brigadier\r\nof the 5th Division. Left column: 200 of 5th Caçadores, 200 of 13th\r\nPortuguese Line, three companies 1/9th Foot--all under Bradford\r\ncommanding Portuguese independent brigade. Why did not Oswald use his\r\nown Portuguese brigade, but draw on Bradford? Possibly because Spry’s\r\nbrigade were discouraged by the failure of their Caçador battalion on\r\nthe 15th.\r\n\r\n[801] Generally in British narratives called the Cask Redoubt, because\r\nwine casks had been used to revet the shifting sand of which the soil\r\nwas there composed.\r\n\r\n[802] Batteries 8 and 7 in the map.\r\n\r\n[803] Batteries 13 and 14 in the map.\r\n\r\n[804] Batteries 12 and 11 in the map.\r\n\r\n[805] No. 6 in the map.\r\n\r\n[806] There is a curious contradiction between Jones and Belmas as to\r\nthe fate of the Cask Redoubt. The latter says that the British took\r\nit--the former that the garrison abandoned it, though not attacked.\r\n\r\n[807] ‘From the looseness of the sand in which the battery was\r\nconstructed, it was found impossible to keep the soles of the\r\nembrasures sufficiently clear to use the three short 24-pounders\r\nmounted on ship carriages--after a few rounds they had to cease\r\nfiring.’ Jones, ii. p. 28.\r\n\r\n[808] Burgoyne’s _Life and Correspondence_, i. p. 267.\r\n\r\n[809] Burgoyne, who took out the flag of truce, says that the French\r\nofficer who met him on the glacis used very angry words (ibid.).\r\n\r\n[810] See _Dickson Papers_, ed. Col. Leslie, p. 970. The second breach\r\nis marked as ‘Lesser Breach’ on the map.\r\n\r\n[811] Burgoyne, whose diary of the siege is one of the primary\r\nauthorities, says that in his opinion the mine could have been much\r\nmore useful than it was. ‘On the discovery of the drain, I should\r\nhave immediately have altered the whole plan of attack. I would have\r\nmade a “globe of compression” to blow in the counterscarp and the\r\ncrest of the glacis, and then at low water have threatened an attack\r\non the breaches, exploded the mine, and have made the real assault on\r\nthe hornwork, which not being threatened had few people in it, and\r\nwould undoubtedly have been carried easily.’ There was, he says, good\r\ncover in the hornwork, which would have been easily connected with\r\nthe parallel, and used as the base for attacking the main front, with\r\nbreaching batteries in its terre-plein and the crest of the glacis.\r\nBurgoyne, i. p. 271. But this is wisdom after the event.\r\n\r\n[812] Jones, ii. p. 36.\r\n\r\n[813] For all these details see Belmas, iv. pp. 620-1.\r\n\r\n[814] Burgoyne says (i. 369) that the engineers on the 24th settled\r\nthat the mine was no more than a signal ‘with a chance of alarming\r\nthem’. On the 25th it would seem that a little more attention, but not\r\nnearly enough, was given to this useful subsidiary operation.\r\n\r\n[815] Burgoyne says at 4.30.\r\n\r\n[816] This is slurred over in the British narratives except _Dickson’s\r\nDiary_, p. 973. Belmas gives some account of it, however, though he\r\ncalls the assailants British instead of Portuguese (iv. p. 623). They\r\nwere some companies of the 8th Caçadores.\r\n\r\n[817] Most of this narrative is from Colin Campbell’s long and\r\ninteresting letter to Sir J. Cameron, printed on pp. 25-30 of his\r\n_Life_ by General Shadwell.\r\n\r\n[818] Gomm, p. 312.\r\n\r\n[819] Frazer’s _Letters from the Peninsula_, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[820] The 38th lost 53 men, the 9th 25, the Portuguese 138 in the\r\nside-attack. Why need Belmas, who had Jones’s book before him, give the\r\ntotal of British losses as 2,000? (_Sièges_, iv. 625).\r\n\r\n[821] Though Jones says that he saw some wounded bayoneted.\r\n\r\n[822] Printed in Maxwell’s _Peninsular Sketches_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[823] Campbell’s letter quoted above in his _Life_, i. p. 30.\r\n\r\n[824] ‘The men, panic stricken, turned and could never be rallied,’\r\nwrites Frazer next day (p. 204). ‘One party, I believe of the 9th and\r\n38th, went up to the breach and then turned and ran away,’ says Larpent\r\n(p. 200). Neither saw the actual assault in the dark.\r\n\r\n[825] So at least he wrote to Castaños on the 24th: ‘j’espère que cette\r\naffaire est finie.’ _Dispatches_, x. p. 564.\r\n\r\n[826] See Frazer, p. 206, and Burgoyne, i. p. 269.\r\n\r\n[827] See Wellington to Graham, night of the 25th, _Dispatches_, x. p.\r\n566.\r\n\r\n[828] Permission was given to leave four guns behind in the main\r\nbreaching batteries and two on Monte Olia, to keep up a semblance of\r\ncontinued attack. _Dispatches_, x. p. 566.\r\n\r\n[829] The British officer in command in the trenches, Major O’Halloran,\r\nwas court martialled, but acquitted. It was proved that he had given\r\nthe correct orders to the Portuguese captains of the companies on\r\nguard, who had not obeyed them. All the prisoners except 30 were\r\nPortuguese.\r\n\r\n[830] The history of this proclamation is curious. Clarke, or Napoleon\r\nhimself, considered it too full of insults of a person who was, after\r\nall, the Emperor’s brother. So it had to be disavowed: Soult wrote to\r\nParis that he had not authorized it, and Clarke had the ingenuity to\r\nprint in the French newspapers that it was an invention of the English\r\ngovernment, intended to disgust the Spanish partisans of King Joseph,\r\nand to advertise the ill feeling that prevailed between the French\r\narmy and the Imperial family. See Vidal de la Blache, i. p. 138; as he\r\nremarks, the style is all Soult’s, and there is not a trace of foreign\r\ndiction in it. No Englishman or Spaniard could have written it.\r\n\r\n[831] Joseph to Napoleon, 1st February 1813.\r\n\r\n[832] See notably the case of General Excelmans.\r\n\r\n[833] See especially the proclamation of March 6, 1815.\r\n\r\n[834] _Mémoires_ of St. Chamans, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[835] Maximilien Lamarque, ii. p. 182.\r\n\r\n[836] Stanhope’s _Conversations with Wellington_, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[837] The gendarmerie were those who had come from the ‘legions’,\r\nemployed in 1811-12-13 as garrisons in Northern Spain. They were\r\nembodied in units, horse and foot, and used as combatants (as at the\r\ncombat of Venta del Pozo, for which see p. 71).\r\n\r\n[838] As Table XVI in the Appendix shows, Foy’s division received\r\ntwo of Sarrut’s regiments: Cassagne’s (now Darmagnac’s) took all\r\nthe French infantry of the old Army of the Centre: Villatte’s (now\r\nAbbé’s) was given two of Abbé’s regiments of the Army of the North:\r\nConroux’s division absorbed Maransin’s independent brigade: Barbot’s\r\n(now Vandermaesen’s) received two regiments of the Army of the North:\r\nDaricau’s (now Maransin’s) got half Leval’s ‘scrapped’ division, Taupin\r\nthe other half of it: Maucune absorbed one of Vandermaesen’s old\r\nregiments, Lamartinière one of Sarrut’s.\r\n\r\n[839] 120th Line of Lamartinière.\r\n\r\n[840] 2nd Léger of same, which suffered heavily at Vittoria while under\r\nSarrut.\r\n\r\n[841] 20,957 to be exact.\r\n\r\n[842] Not only the _Afrancesados_ but some of the Army of the North\r\ntroops withdrawn from the Biscay garrisons had a poor record, and had\r\ndisgusted Foy in his recent Tolosa fight. These were high-numbered\r\nbattalions, recently made up from the Bayonne conscript reserve.\r\n\r\n[843] The best proof of the efficiency of the bulk of Villatte’s corps\r\nis that when Vandermaesen’s and Maucune’s divisions were cut to pieces\r\nin the battles of the Pyrenees, Soult made up a new brigade for each of\r\nthem out of the Reserve. Joseph’s French Guards fought splendidly at\r\nSan Marcial. The Germans were very steady veteran troops.\r\n\r\n[844] Vidal de la Blache, i. p. 160.\r\n\r\n[845] See above, p. 533.

Clere, _Campagne du Maréchal Soult_, p.\r\n46, and Vidal de la Blache, i. p. 182.\r\n\r\n[846] One asks oneself why Soult did not give Reille the Maya attack,\r\nsaving him two-thirds of his journey, and send D’Erlon to join Clausel\r\nat St. Jean-Pied-du-Port, by a march much shorter than Reille was asked\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n[847] It is said that persons acquainted with the country told Soult to\r\nsend the whole column round by Bayonne, on account of the artillery,\r\nbut that he refused. As a matter of fact, Lamartinière’s division and\r\nsome of the guns _did_ go that détour, owing to the broken bridge.\r\n\r\n[848] Wellington to Graham, July 22. _Dispatches_, x. p. 559.\r\n\r\n[849] Ibid., p. 563, same to same.\r\n\r\n[850] _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 113.\r\n\r\n[851] Ibid., p. 114.\r\n\r\n[852] Wellington to Graham, July 24, _Dispatches_, x. p. 563.\r\n\r\n[853] Same morning, to Giron, ibid., p. 564.\r\n\r\n[854] Wellington to Graham, 25th July, _Dispatches_, x. p. 566.\r\n\r\n[855] Wellington to Graham, _Dispatches_, x. p. 570.\r\n\r\n[856] See especially Lemonnier-Delafosse, pp. 211-12, and Wachholz of\r\nBrunswick-Oels, p. 321.\r\n\r\n[857] Vittoria and light companies of Doyle, La Union, and Legion\r\nEstremena.\r\n\r\n[858] La Union and the Legion, minus their light companies.\r\n\r\n[859] Doyle and 2nd of Jaen.\r\n\r\n[860] Sometimes called the Puerto de Val Carlos.\r\n\r\n[861] See the very interesting letter of Bainbrigge of the 20th,\r\nprinted as an Appendix to the regimental history of that corps, p. 390.\r\n\r\n[862] Bainbrigge says that it was 7 a.m. before the regiment reached\r\nthe Linduz, but that it was an hour earlier is demonstrated by the fact\r\nthat they heard firing at Roncesvalles after arriving. Now Byng’s fight\r\non the Leiçaratheca began at 6 a.m. Therefore Ross was on the Linduz\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n[863] What became of this Spanish company? Captain Tovey of the 20th\r\n(see history of that corps, p. 408) says that the French ‘made the\r\nSpanish picquet, who were posted to give us intelligence, prisoners,\r\nwithout their firing a shot’. Another account is that having seen Ross\r\narrive, they quietly went off to rejoin their brigade, without giving\r\nany notice.\r\n\r\n[864] There is a curious and interesting account of all this in the\r\nMemoirs of Lemonnier-Delafosse, aide-de-camp to Clausel, who was twice\r\nsent to stir up Barbot, whose conduct he describes in scathing terms\r\n(pp. 212-14). Clausel says that the 50th stormed the Leiçaratheca. That\r\nit stormed an abandoned position is shown by the figure of its losses.\r\nWhat Clausel does not tell can be gathered from Byng’s workmanlike\r\ndispatch to Cole, in _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. pp. 128-9.\r\n\r\n[865] Of the 27th and 130th Line.\r\n\r\n[866] I confess that I doubt these figures. Martinien’s lists show the\r\n27th Line with seven officer-casualties, the 1st Line with two, the\r\n25th Léger with three, the 130th with two. Fourteen officer-casualties\r\nought to mean more like 280 than 100 casualties of all ranks. In the\r\nwhole Pyrenean campaign the French army lost 120 officers to 12,300\r\nmen--nearly 30 men to each officer. Clausel asks us to believe that\r\nat Roncesvalles the proportion was one officer to twelve men! Yet, of\r\ncourse, such disproportion is quite _possible_.\r\n\r\n[867] While we have quite a number of good personal narratives\r\nof the fight on the Linduz, I have found for the fight on the\r\nLeiçaratheca nothing but the official reports of Clausel, Byng, and\r\nMorillo, save the memoirs of George L’Estrange of the 31st and of\r\nLemonnier-Delafosse, who is interesting but obviously inaccurate, since\r\nhe says that the French regiment which carried the hill was the 71st.\r\nNot only was it the 50th, as Clausel specially mentions, but 71 was a\r\nblank number in the French Army List.\r\n\r\n[868] Four, not five, because the light company of the 20th was absent\r\nwith the other light companies far to the right: so the wing was only\r\nfour companies strong, or three deducting Tovey’s men. Wachholz forgets\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[869] Wachholz, p. 322.\r\n\r\n[870] Tovey fortunately wrote a narrative of this little affair, which\r\nmay be found in the history of the 20th, p. 408. He says: ‘The enemy’s\r\nlight troops opened so galling a fire that Major-General Ross called\r\nout for a company to go to the front. Without waiting for orders I\r\npushed out with mine, and in close order and double-quick cleared\r\naway the skirmishers from a sort of plateau. They did not wait for\r\nus: on reaching its opposite side we came so suddenly on the head of\r\nthe enemy’s infantry column, which had just gained a footing on the\r\nsummit of the hill, that the men of my company absolutely paused in\r\nastonishment, for we were face to face with them. The French officer\r\ncalled to us to throw down our arms: I replied “bayonet away,” and\r\nrushing on them we turned them back down the descent. Such was the\r\npanic and confusion caused by the sudden onset, that our small party\r\n(for such it was compared to the French column) had time to regain the\r\nregiment, but my military readers may rest assured that it required to\r\nbe done _double quick_.’\r\n\r\n[871] This ditch had been cut by the Spaniards in 1793 as an outer\r\nprotection to their redoubt on the Linduz.\r\n\r\n[872] Wachholz, p. 324.\r\n\r\n[873] The 6th Léger, 69th (2 battalions), 76th, and 36th show\r\ncasualties, the rear regiments (39th and 65th) none. Nor does Maucune’s\r\ndivision. Similarly on the British side none of Anson’s or Stubbs’s\r\nbattalions contribute to the list.\r\n\r\n[874] As we have seen already, Clausel puts his loss at the\r\nLeiçaratheca at 160, to Byng’s and Morillo’s 120. At the other end of\r\nthe line Ross’s brigade had lost 216 men--139 of them in the 20th, 31\r\nin the 7th, 42 in the 23rd, 4 in the Brunswick company. [I know not\r\nwhere Napier got his strange statement that this company lost 42 men:\r\ntheir captain, Wachholz, reports 2 killed and 2 wounded.] Foy’s six\r\nfront battalions had lost 10 officers and 361 men. The total Allied\r\nloss was about 350, there having been a few casualties among Campbell’s\r\nPortuguese and among the Spaniards at Orbaiceta. The total French loss\r\nwas not less than 530. Both figures are very moderate. Cole estimated\r\nthe French casualties at 2,000 men! Soult wrote that he had almost\r\nexterminated the 20th, whose total loss had been 139.\r\n\r\n[875] Cole to Wellington, _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 127.\r\n\r\n[876] Wellington to Liverpool, _Dispatches_, x. p. 596.\r\n\r\n[877] See vol. iv. pp. 389-90.\r\n\r\n[878] Cole to Murray, Linzoain, July 26th.

Moyle Sherer says\r\nthat Thorne owned that there was a small column on the move, but that\r\nhe judged it to be a battalion shifting its quarters, or a relief of\r\noutposts.\r\n\r\n[885] Mr. Fortescue (_History of the Army_, ix. p. 258) thinks that the\r\n34th got up in time to join in their last struggle. But Bell of that\r\nregiment says ‘we laboured on, but all too late--a forlorn hope--our\r\ncomrades were _all_ killed, wounded, or prisoners. The enemy had full\r\npossession of the ground.’ Bell’s _Rough Notes_, i. p. 103.\r\n\r\n[886] Bell’s _Rough Notes_, i. p. 103.\r\n\r\n[887] Bell, i. p. 104.\r\n\r\n[888] All this is most difficult to follow, our numerous sources\r\ncontradicting each other in matters of detail in the most puzzling\r\nfashion. For this part of the narrative I have used, beside the\r\ndispatch of William Stewart, the books of Moyle Sherer of the 34th, who\r\ncommanded the Aretesque picquet and was taken prisoner--Sir George Bell\r\nof the same regiment, Cadell of the 28th, Hope and Sergeant Robertson\r\nof the 92nd, Patterson of the 50th, the two anonymous diarists ‘J.\r\nS.’ and the ‘Scottish Soldier’ of the 71st, besides D’Erlon’s and\r\nDarmagnac’s original dispatches, lent me by Mr. Fortescue. I take it\r\nthat each authority may be followed for the doings of his own corps,\r\nbut is of inferior weight for those of other units. Patterson says that\r\nthe 34th was at one time in close touch with the 50th, Cadell that the\r\n28th and 92nd worked together, while Hope says that the 28th was only\r\nseen by the 92nd right wing after it had ended its terrible first entry\r\ninto the fight. Patterson says that he saw O’Callaghan of the 39th\r\nfighting along with the 50th in the third episode of the combat, when,\r\naccording to other sources, that regiment had already retreated south\r\ntoward the valley with the 34th. Stewart’s dispatch only speaks of the\r\n28th and 34th retiring in that direction, not the 39th. A confused\r\nfight has left confused memories. I cannot be sure of all the details.\r\n\r\n[889] The statement in Napier and succeeding writers that the wounded\r\nof the right wing of the 92nd formed a bank behind which the French\r\nadvance halted, and stood to receive the fire of the left wing of that\r\nsame corps, whose bullets hit many of its comrades, comes from the\r\nnarrative of Norton of the 34th (Napier, V. appendix, p. 442), who was\r\nsome way off. That the troops which came up were the right wing 71st,\r\nand not the left wing 92nd, seems to me proved by the narrative of Hope\r\nof the 92nd, who distinctly says that the right wing were relieved by\r\nthe 71st, and that the left wing were still holding the Maya position\r\nand under Stewart, who had just arrived, along with the left wing of\r\nthe 71st (_Military Memoirs_, p. 210).\r\n\r\n[890] He himself in his dispatch only says that it was after 1 p.m.\r\n\r\n[891] Tulloh (commanding 2nd division batteries) to Dickson, in\r\n_Dickson Papers_, p. 1022. Wellington’s censure of Stewart may be found\r\nin _Dispatches_, x. p. 588, and his reply to the latter’s self-defence\r\nin xi. p. 107. The details are hard to follow: Wellington says that\r\nPringle ordered the guns to be taken off by the road to Maya--that\r\nStewart directed that they were to go back, and look to ‘the mountain\r\nroad to Elizondo’ as their proper line of retreat. When it became\r\nnecessary for them to retire at all costs, that road was already in the\r\nhands of the French. But I do not know precisely what Wellington meant\r\nby the mountain-road to Elizondo. Does it mean the track by which the\r\n28th and 34th had retired?\r\n\r\n[892] See Stewart’s Report to Hill, Berueta, July 26.\r\n\r\n[893] Robertson, pp. 109-10.\r\n\r\n[894] Stewart’s dispatch says that it was the 82nd who fought with\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n[895] This was not the brigade to which the 82nd belonged, but the\r\nreserve brigade of the 7th Division, short of one of its units, the 3rd\r\nProvisional.\r\n\r\n[896] Cf. _Dispatches_, x. pp. 597-8.\r\n\r\n[897] ‘Lettres de l’Empereur Napoléon non insérées dans la\r\n_Correspondance_, publiées par X. Paris and Nancy, 1909,’ page 3. It is\r\namusing to find out what Napoleon III omitted of his uncle’s letters.\r\n\r\n[898] ‘Lettres de l’Empereur Napoléon non insérées dans la\r\n_Correspondance_,’ p. 13.\r\n\r\n[899] Wellington’s letter to Graham, giving the false report that\r\nD’Erlon had been repulsed at Maya, is dated at 10 p.m. The letter to\r\nO’Donnell must be a little later, as it repeats this error, but adds\r\nthat a note has come in from Cole, saying that he was heavily engaged\r\nat noon. _Dispatches_, x. pp. 566-7.\r\n\r\n[900] The dispatch giving this information (_Dispatches_, x. p. 570)\r\nis wrongly dated in the Wellington correspondence. It should be July\r\n_26th_ at 4 a.m. The hour of the receipt of Hill’s and Stewart’s\r\nreports is not given.\r\n\r\n[901] All in _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. pp. 120-1.\r\n\r\n[902] Hill to Murray, _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 121.\r\n\r\n[903] The orders to Pack and Dalhousie may be found in _Supplementary\r\nDispatches_, xix. p. 258-9, dated from Almandoz--obviously before\r\nCole’s dispatch had come to hand.\r\n\r\n[904] This letter in _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. pp. 124-5, is\r\nthere wrongly dated July 27th (for 26th). Cole, of course, was no\r\nlonger at Linzoain on the 27th.\r\n\r\n[905] To Picton from Almandoz, _Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. p. 259.\r\n\r\n[906] Picton to Murray, 8.30 p.m., _Supplementary Dispatches_, xviii.\r\npp. 121-2.\r\n\r\n[907] See above, p. 622.\r\n\r\n[908] See above, p. 591.\r\n\r\n[909] These are his own words, in his Report of August 2.\r\n\r\n[910] Foy to Reille, July 20.\r\n\r\n[911] Reille to Soult, July 27.\r\n\r\n[912] The tall hat is vouched for by George L’Estrange of the 31st, and\r\nWachholz from Ross’s brigade, the furled umbrella by Bainbrigge of the\r\n20th, all eye-witnesses, whose narratives are among the few detailed\r\naccounts of this retreat.\r\n\r\n[913] Words overheard by Bainbrigge in his own company.\r\n\r\n[914] See Quartermaster-General to Picton, enclosing letter for Cole,\r\nsent off from Lesaca on July 23 (_Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. pp.\r\n112-13), which must have reached Picton at Olague on the 24th.\r\n\r\n[915] This seems a more controvertible plea. Orders went out from\r\nLesaca on the 23rd, and must have reached Picton not very late in the\r\nday on the 24th. Supposing he had marched from Olague on the afternoon\r\nof the 24th, he would have been at Zubiri (only 6 miles off) on that\r\nsame night, or even at Viscarret. And from Zubiri to Roncesvalles is\r\nnot an excessive day’s march for the 25th, especially when firing was\r\nto be heard at the front.\r\n\r\n[916] The remaining four were in the Caçador battalion of Stubbs’s\r\nPortuguese brigade.\r\n\r\n[917] Unfortunately all French losses are given _en bloc_ for the\r\nsix days July 27 to August 1, and the casualties of each day cannot\r\nbe disentangled. The casualties of Maya and Roncesvalles _can_ be\r\nascertained, but not those of the subsequent days.\r\n\r\n[918] Viz. about 6,000 of Cole’s division, 5,000 of his own, 1,700 of\r\nByng’s brigade, 2,500 of Campbell’s Portuguese at Eugui, only a few\r\nmiles away, and something under 4,000 of Morillo’s Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[919] See Belmas, iv. p. 803.\r\n\r\n[920] Napier says (v. p. 225), and all subsequent historians have\r\nfollowed him, that Picton originally intended to place Cole on a line\r\nbetween Oricain and Arleta, i. e. on the low back-slope of the ridge.\r\nThis seems to me almost incredible, as this ground is all running\r\ndownhill, completely commanded by the much loftier crests about the\r\nCol. Surely no one, according to the tactical ideas of 1813, would\r\ntake up a defensive position half-way down a slope whose summit is\r\nabandoned to the enemy. I can find no authority save Napier (who was\r\nnot in the battle) for this curious statement. And I am justified, I\r\nthink, in holding that the San Miguel hill was the place where Picton\r\nintended to place Cole, by the narrative and sketch-map of Wachholz of\r\nRoss’s brigade, who places the first position of the 4th Division on a\r\nwell-marked hill immediately to the right of Villaba, and close to the\r\n3rd Division’s ground at Huarte. This _must_ mean San Miguel.\r\n\r\n[921] R. Hill’s, Ponsonby’s, the Hussar brigade, and D’Urban’s\r\nPortuguese, Fane’s brigade, which was observing on the side of Aragon,\r\ndid not arrive this day.\r\n\r\n[922] One of the 4th Line.\r\n\r\n[923] Reille’s report of August 1st.\r\n\r\n[924] Clausel in his report says that he arrived in time to see the 4th\r\nDivision cross the hill of Oricain.\r\n\r\n[925] Perhaps Carlos de España’s division, arriving from the south.\r\n\r\n[926] All this from the very interesting narrative of Clausel’s\r\naide-de-camp Lemonnier Delafosse (p. 220), who bore the first message\r\nto Soult, and was (like his chief) much irritated by the Marshal’s\r\ncaution and refusal to commit himself. Clausel had got a completely\r\nerroneous notion of the enemy’s intentions--like Ney at Bussaco.\r\n\r\n[927] Quartermaster-General to Sir R. Hill, _Supplementary Dispatches_,\r\nviii. pp. 259-60.\r\n\r\n[928] Wellington to Pack, _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 122,\r\nwrongly dated 1 o’clock--it should be 10 o’clock. Wellington was at\r\nSorauren by 11.\r\n\r\n[929] Final destination not given--clearly it might be down the\r\nhigh-road to Pampeluna; but if Picton had retreated still further and\r\nraised the siege, it might be to Lizaso, to join Hill and the rest.\r\n\r\n[930] Wellington described his ride to Larpent, his Judge-Advocate\r\nGeneral, a week later, in the following terse language (Larpent, p.\r\n242): ‘At one time it was rather alarming, certainly, and a close\r\nrun thing. When I came to the bridge of Sorauren I saw French on the\r\nhills on one side, and it was clear that we could make a stand on the\r\nother hill, in our position of the 28th, but I found that we could not\r\nkeep Sorauren, as it was exposed to their fire and not to ours. I was\r\nobliged to write my orders accordingly at Sorauren, to be sent back\r\ninstantly. For if they had not been dispatched back directly, by the\r\nway I had come, I must have sent them four leagues round, a quarter of\r\nan hour later. I stopped therefore to write accordingly, people saying\r\nto me all the time, “The French are coming!” “The French are coming!” I\r\nlooked pretty sharp after them every now and then, till I had completed\r\nmy orders, and then set off. I saw them just near the one end of the\r\nvillage as I went out of it at the other end. And then we took up our\r\nground.’ Wellington then added, in a confidential moment, that there\r\nneed have been no fuss or trouble, if only Cole had kept sending the\r\nproper information on the 26th and 27th. If only his intention of\r\ngoing right back to Pampeluna had been known earlier, the 6th and\r\n7th Divisions could have been up on the 27th, and Hill’s corps too,\r\nwhich had been kept at Irurita and Berueta for 36 hours, because the\r\nsituation in the south was concealed by Cole’s reticence. ‘We should\r\nhave stopped the French much sooner.’\r\n\r\n[931] French critics expressed surprise that Wellington did not tell\r\nPack to fall on Clausel’s flank and rear. But the 6th Division,\r\nattacking from Olague, would have been out of touch with the rest of\r\nthe army, and Wellington did not believe in attacks by isolated corps\r\nuncombined with the main army, and unable to communicate with it. See\r\nDumas’ _Campagne du Maréchal Soult_, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[932] Bainbrigge’s narrative in Smyth’s _History of the XXth_, p. 396.\r\n\r\n[933] Ibid. Bainbrigge was standing close to both.\r\n\r\n[934] Larpent, p. 243.\r\n\r\n[935] Lemonnier-Delafosse, p. 219.\r\n\r\n[936] Soult to Clarke, July 28.\r\n\r\n[937] _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 123.\r\n\r\n[938] Ibid., p. 124.\r\n\r\n[939] See above, p. 661.\r\n\r\n[940] Reports of Maucune and Lamartinière dated August 3rd and 4th.\r\n\r\n[941] Clausel’s report of August 2.\r\n\r\n[942] There is a most curious and difficult point in this history of\r\nthe first phase of the action. Clausel says, and he is of course a\r\nprimary authority, that though Conroux was already deeply engaged with\r\nthe 6th Division, ‘was being fired on from all sides, was suffering\r\nsevere losses, and had already had one of his brigadiers disabled’\r\n[Schwitter], he told him that he must join in the attack ‘swerving to\r\nthe left so as to mount the hill in the direction originally assigned\r\nto him’, which was done and Conroux immediately repulsed. I cannot\r\nsee how this was physically possible. How could Conroux, if already\r\ndisadvantageously engaged with the 6th Division, and ‘fired at from\r\nall sides’, break off this fight and attack any point of the hill of\r\nOricain? If he had gone away in that direction, _who was there to\r\nhold Sorauren against Pack’s people, who were pressing in on it, and\r\n(as Clausel says) only a musket-shot away from it_? As far as I can\r\nmake out, Conroux must have been sufficiently employed in fending off\r\nPack and maintaining Sorauren, so as to cover the flank of the other\r\ndivisions, for the next hour or two. No other authority but Clausel\r\ngives any hint that Conroux got away from Pack and joined in the\r\ngeneral assault. And I am constrained to think that Clausel (strange as\r\nit may seem) is making a misstatement--and that when Conroux is said to\r\nhave been ordered to attack the hill by swerving to the left, he can\r\nonly have been keeping off Pack. I note that Vidal de la Blache and\r\nMr. Fortescue try to accept Clausel’s story, but that General Beatson\r\n(_With Wellington in the Pyrenees_, pp. 170-2) ignores it.\r\n\r\n[943] I include, in reckoning Picton’s force at Bussaco, his own\r\ndivision and the three battalions of Leith’s first brigade which\r\nbrought him help. In Cole’s Oricain figures are reckoned the 4th\r\nDivision, Byng’s brigade, Campbell’s Portuguese, and two Spanish\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\n[944] Lemonnier-Delafosse of the 31st Léger.\r\n\r\n[945] This exceptional use of grenadiers in the skirmishing line, I\r\nget from an observation of Bainbrigge of the 20th, who expresses his\r\nsurprise that the troops with whom he was engaged, though acting as\r\n_tirailleurs_, were not light infantry, but men in tall bearskin caps\r\nlike the Guard, ‘some of the finest-looking soldiers I ever met’ (p.\r\n400).\r\n\r\n[946] The 10th Caçadores, Campbell’s light battalion, was a very weak\r\nunit of only 250 bayonets.\r\n\r\n[947] Clausel’s report of August 2.\r\n\r\n[948] D’Haw of the 34th Léger.\r\n\r\n[949] The fourth battalion of the brigade, the 1/40th was detached\r\nbelow on the Spaniards’ Hill.\r\n\r\n[950] Lemonnier-Delafosse, pp. 227-8.\r\n\r\n[951] The Buffs lost only 2 men, the 1st Provisional (2/31st and\r\n2/66th) only 5--so can hardly have been engaged,--but the 1/57th had 63\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\n[952] The above narrative is reconstructed from Reille’s two reports\r\n(the divisional report of Lamartinière, however, is useless) and from\r\nnarratives of Stretton of the 40th in Maxwell’s _Peninsular Sketches_,\r\nand Mills in the history of the regiment by Smythies.\r\n\r\n[953] There is little about this affair in the British narratives.\r\nDiarists were rare in the 6th Division. The only point of interest I\r\nfound in them is the mention of mule-guns used by the French.\r\n\r\n[954] Larpent, p. 221. Cf.

See Duncan’s _History of the Royal\r\nArtillery_, ii. p. 190.\r\n\r\n[974] Sympher’s, of the K.G.L.\r\n\r\n[975] Foy in Girod de l’Ain, p. 220.\r\n\r\n[976] That the firing began at dawn immediately is stated by Larpent,\r\np. 210. That the troops were under arms before daylight is noted by the\r\nanonymous _Soldier of the 42nd_, p. 199. The attack by the 6th Division\r\non Sorauren was appreciably before the descent of Cole and Byng from\r\nthe heights of Oricain.\r\n\r\n[977] Girod de l’Ain, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[978] 43rd Line (2 battalions).\r\n\r\n[979] Maucune’s 34th Léger reports 13 officers and 531 men prisoners\r\nout of a strength of 773. Why does Captain Vidal de la Blache, usually\r\naccurate, give this as Maucune’s total loss in prisoners? (cf. p.\r\n251). His other battalions contribute another 550. Conroux’s 55th and\r\n58th Line give respectively 282 and 348 prisoners--the other regiments\r\nsmaller but appreciable lists of captured.\r\n\r\n[980] Interesting accounts of this fight may be found in the narratives\r\nof Wood of the 82nd, Green of the 68th, and Wheeler of the 51st--all in\r\nInglis’s brigade. They are, however, most confused, none of them having\r\nmuch notion of how or where they came into the general scheme of the\r\nfight. All speak of the steepness of the ground.\r\n\r\n[981] I cannot make out for certain when Le Cor’s Portuguese joined\r\nDalhousie on the 30th, coming from the Marcalain road, where they had\r\nbeen placed on the previous evening. Probably not early, as they had\r\n64 casualties only (mostly in 2nd Caçadores), while the other brigades\r\nhad 200 apiece. The fact that the losses are nearly all in the light\r\nbattalion shows that a skirmishing pursuit was the task of Le Cor’s men.\r\n\r\n[982] Clausel’s report is (perhaps naturally) very reticent, and would\r\ngive a reader who had no other sources to utilize a very inadequate\r\naccount of the day’s work--no one could possibly gather from it that\r\nConroux lost 600 prisoners and Vandermaesen 300, or that the whole\r\ncorps was in great disorder. For a picture of Conroux’s division\r\nscattered over the hills, and its general storming at the fugitives,\r\nsee Lemonnier-Delafosse, p. 232.\r\n\r\nThe hours at which events took place on Clausel’s wing are hard to\r\nsettle. I follow him in making the artillery begin to play on Sorauren\r\n_long_ before 7, the infantry attack soon after that hour, and the loss\r\nof Sorauren about 9.\r\n\r\n[983] So Lamartinière, who admits that there was ‘un peu de désordre’\r\nbut confesses much less than Foy, for whose account see Girod de l’Ain,\r\np. 221.\r\n\r\n[984] Picton’s division lost 89 in Brisbane’s brigade, 20 among Power’s\r\nPortuguese, none in Colville’s brigade.\r\n\r\n[985] So Foy. Reille thinks that it was Sarrasibar, 3 miles farther\r\neast.\r\n\r\n[986] Girod de l’Ain, p. 223.\r\n\r\n[987] See Vidal de la Blache, p. 280, for complaints by the French\r\n_maires_ of atrocities committed.\r\n\r\n[988] See above, p. 681.\r\n\r\n[989] See above, p. 664.\r\n\r\n[990] All this in Q.M.G. to Hill, &c., in _Supplementary Dispatches_,\r\nviii. pp. 154-5, where it is stupidly printed _after_ the evening\r\norders given at 9 p.m.\r\n\r\n[991] Soult says by way of Zubiri, Eugui, and Lanz, which seems a\r\nvast circuit--this march must surely have been made on the preceding\r\nevening: in the dark it would hardly have been possible.\r\n\r\n[992] 75th Line. Darmagnac says in his report that its colonel attacked\r\nthe second position without orders. Martinien’s lists show that it lost\r\n16 officers--presumably therefore over 300 men.\r\n\r\n[993] See casualty tables in Appendix. Maransin had no losses, having\r\nnever been engaged. Hill made an astounding blunder in estimating his\r\ntotal loss at 400 in his report to Wellington. Nine British and 36\r\nPortuguese officers were hit--exactly the same number as the French\r\nofficer-casualties.\r\n\r\n[994] Hill had Fitzgerald’s and O’Callaghan’s British brigades--2,600\r\ndeducting Maya losses, Da Costa’s brigade 2,300, Ashworth’s 2,800, and\r\nsome squadrons of Long’s light dragoons--about 8,000 in all. D’Erlon\r\nhad, also deducting 2,000 Maya losses, over 18,000 infantry in his\r\nthree divisions--not to speak of the cavalry division just arrived.\r\n\r\n[995] Soult to Clarke, August 2.\r\n\r\n[996] _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. pp. 152-3.\r\n\r\n[997] _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p. 154, written at Ostiz, 30th\r\nJuly, many hours after the preceding note to Alten, also written on the\r\n30th but from Villaba.

But Larpent’s absolutely contemporary diary also has the tale (p.\r\n218) written down on August 3, only two days after the supposed event.\r\n\r\n[1017] Wellington to O’Donnell. _Supplementary Dispatches_, viii. p.\r\n163.\r\n\r\n[1018] Some good diarists had been wounded at Sorauren, and fail us\r\nafter the 28th July.\r\n\r\n[1019] One of the French officers killed on August 1, Hutant of the\r\n59th, is registered as ‘tué en défendant l’aigle.’ Now with such\r\nabsurdly small casualty lists as those shown above, the eagle can only\r\nhave been in danger if the regiment was ‘on the run.’\r\n\r\n[1020] I had immense difficulty in identifying this battalion, which\r\nbelonged to Barcena’s division, as Wellington mentions in his letter to\r\nLord Liverpool of August 4 (_Dispatches_, x. p. 598). But Wellington\r\ncalls it there a cazadore battalion, which it was not, but an old line\r\nbattalion. The trouble was first to find the composition of Barcena’s\r\ndivision in July 1813, and then to hunt in Spanish regimental histories\r\n(those of the Conde de Clonard) for a claim by any of those corps to\r\nhave been at the bridge of Yanzi on August 1. Alone among all the\r\nregiments Asturias makes this claim--but the corps-historian says not\r\none word about its meritorious service--evidently unknown to him.\r\n\r\n[1021] Reille says in his report that the order ‘halt,’ issued at\r\nthe head of the column, was repeated down the column of dragoons and\r\nturned in the noise and confusion into ‘demi tour’. Whereupon the rear\r\nregiments thought the column was cut off, and galloped back in panic.\r\n‘Halte’ is not very like ‘demi tour’--but there was no doubt about the\r\npanic.\r\n\r\n[1022] We learn from Lamartinière’s report that it was one of the 118th\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n[1023] He declares in his report that he never heard of the trouble\r\nuntil nightfall.\r\n\r\n[1024] Report of Maucune, dated August 3.\r\n\r\n[1025] Report of Reille.\r\n\r\n[1026] Report of the Right Wing--dated that night, August 1.\r\n\r\n[1027] D’Erlon complains that he found no French troops whatever facing\r\nthe bridge--i. e. the 118th and Maucune had disappeared long before his\r\nfront battalion got up. The battalions engaged were the 5th Léger and\r\n63rd and 64th Line--whose officer-casualties for that day were 1 killed\r\nand 8 wounded.\r\n\r\n[1028] The best account of all this is in Graham’s report,\r\n_Supplementary Dispatches_, xiv. p. 261.\r\n\r\n[1029] All these marches are mainly detailed from the excellent\r\nnarrative of Quartermaster Surtees of the 3/95th, pp. 223-6,\r\nsupplemented by that of Captain Cooke of the 1/43rd.\r\n\r\n[1030] See above, p. 700.\r\n\r\n[1031] See above, p. 707.\r\n\r\n[1032] See above, p. 710. It was written at Ostiz on the night of the\r\n30th, but only sent off by G. Murray from Lizaso on the morning of the\r\n31st.\r\n\r\n[1033] See Cooke, i. p. 315.\r\n\r\n[1034] Cooke, i. pp. 315-16.\r\n\r\n[1035] Some, therefore, of P. Soult’s chasseurs must have been with the\r\nrearguard.\r\n\r\n[1036] Cooke, i. p. 317.\r\n\r\n[1037] Surtees, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[1038] _Dispatches_, x. p. 591.\r\n\r\n[1039] Probably also we must add the responsibility for Hill and the\r\n2nd Division being at Elizondo this day, owing to the false march which\r\nthey had made--on Wellington’s orders--from the Puerto de Arraiz to the\r\nVelate road.\r\n\r\n[1040] Wellington in _Dispatches_, xi. p. 7, blames Barcena for\r\nthis--one would have supposed that Graham and Giron were still more\r\nresponsible, as they were in higher command.\r\n\r\n[1041] Orders for Q.M.G. from Santesteban, 9.30 a.m. _Supplementary\r\nDispatches_, viii. p. 164.\r\n\r\n[1042] Wellington to Graham, 8 p.m., from Santesteban. _Dispatches_, x.\r\np. 574.\r\n\r\n[1043] Cooke, i. 819.\r\n\r\n[1044] A brigadier in Maransin’s division.\r\n\r\n[1045] Larpent’s diary, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[1046] Harry Smith, i. p. 115.\r\n\r\n[1047] Dalhousie to Cairnes in _Dickson Papers_, ed. Leslie, p. 1020.\r\n\r\n[1048] 2/24th and 2/58th.\r\n\r\n[1049] Wellington thought this the most desperate and gallant charge he\r\nhad ever seen. _Dispatches_, x. p. 591.\r\n\r\n[1050] Report of Clausel, August 2. ‘Les troupes relevées n’ayant\r\npu, malgré les efforts des généraux Conroux et Rey, s’arrêter sur\r\nla position indiquée, et s’étant jetées sur celles qui repoussaient\r\nl’attaque de la direction d’Échalar, il s’ensuivit un peu de confusion,\r\net on fut obligé de les laisser aller jusqu’à l’hauteur de la division\r\nTaupin.’\r\n\r\n[1051] Ross’s brigade had a few casualties in each battalion--37 in all.\r\n\r\n[1052] ‘Devant la division Maransin je n’ai vu que des tirailleurs,’\r\nsays Clausel. From the sequence of brigades in the 7th Division, I\r\nthink these must have been Lecor’s people.\r\n\r\n[1053] Cooke, i. p. 320. Both he and Surtees mention that the evicted\r\nFrench battalion was the 2nd Léger--a fact not to be found in the\r\nreports of Lamartinière or of Reille.\r\n\r\n[1054] The total French loss was probably not very great--as happens\r\nwhen troops give at once, and are not pursued. Conroux’s division only\r\nrecords 5 officer-casualties, Vandermaesen’s 8--which should mean a\r\ntotal casualty list of 300 or so. But it is astonishing to find Reille\r\nreporting that Maucune lost only about 20 men; if so, the flank-guard\r\ncannot have stood at all.\r\n\r\n[1055] Soult to Clarke, August 2, and August 6.\r\n\r\n[1056] _Dispatches_, x. p. 591.\r\n\r\n[1057] Ibid., x. p. 611. August 7.\r\n\r\n[1058] 6,440 to be exact. Of which 4,708 were British and 1,732\r\nPortuguese. The latter figure is worked out from the detailed\r\nPortuguese returns in Appendix No. XXI, and is perceptibly lower than\r\nWellington’s original estimate of 2,300: stragglers no doubt had been\r\nrejoining.\r\n\r\n[1059] e. g. the troops on the Roncesvalles road, the two battalions\r\nof Lamartinière which followed Foy, and Maransin’s 28th Léger from\r\nElizondo--at least 2,500 in all.\r\n\r\n[1060] Cassagne succeeded Barrois shortly after.\r\n\r\n[1061] After D’Erlon was removed to command the Army of the Centre,\r\nthis division was at different times under Remond and Semélé.\r\n\r\n[1062] Attached to Whittingham. Regiments of Olivenza and Almanza.\r\n\r\n[1063] 3rd Léger, properly belonging to Lamarque’s brigade from\r\nCatalonia, was short of four companies left in garrisons.\r\n\r\n[1064] The second battalions of these corps were left behind, along\r\nwith the 11th and 20th Ligne, two squadrons of 4th Hussars, one of 24th\r\nDragoons, the 3/5th Léger, and some 250 Italian Light Horse, to hold\r\ndown the kingdom of Valencia.\r\n\r\n[1065] In Portuguese Units officers and men are given together.\r\n\r\n[1066] The other Guards’ Brigade, 1st and 3rd batts. of 1st Guards, was\r\nleft at Oporto and did not rejoin till August.\r\n\r\n[1067] 2/31st and 2/66th.\r\n\r\n[1068] 2nd and 2/53rd.\r\n\r\n[1069] 2/24th and 2/58th.\r\n\r\n[1070] These figures are estimated from what was still surviving of\r\neach unit when Soult reorganized the army in July 16. The Royal Guards\r\ninfantry had then 2,019 men, the line cavalry 64 officers and 500 men,\r\nthe line infantry 1,168, though it had lost over 300 men at Vittoria\r\nand a much greater number from desertion. I take it that to allow 300\r\nextra men at the battle for the Guard infantry, 100 more for the Line\r\ncavalry, and 800 more for the Line infantry cannot be far out.\r\n\r\n[1071] About 40 prisoners of the 1/71st are lost among the general\r\ntotal of 223 ‘missing and stragglers’: these were the only actual\r\nprisoners lost in the battle. See p. 416 of this volume.\r\n\r\n[1072] i. e. 2/31st and 2/66th.\r\n\r\n[1073] i. e. 2nd and 2/53rd.\r\n\r\n[1074] Brunswick-Oels Head-Quarters were in the 7th Division, but\r\ncompanies were distributed all around the Army. These casualties partly\r\nbelong to outlying companies, not to Head-Quarters.\r\n\r\n[1075] Pannetier’s flying column, which tried to relieve Tarragona,\r\nconsisted of 3/5th Léger, and two battalions each of 20th Line and 3rd\r\nLéger, with the Westphalian chasseurs: a little under 3,000 men.\r\n\r\n[1076] But originally an A. of S. regiment, transferred to A. of N. in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n[1077] Originally an A. of P. regiment, but transferred to A. of N. in\r\nJanuary 1813.\r\n\r\n[1078] General William Stewart, commanding the Division.\r\n\r\n[1079] Colonel Fitzgerald, 5/60th, commanding a Brigade.",
