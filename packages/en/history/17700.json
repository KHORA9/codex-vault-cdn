While I could not hope entirely to overcome such a\r\ndifficulty, I nevertheless trust that I have succeeded in rendering this\r\nmonograph a small contribution to the scientific study of slavery and\r\nthe American Negro.\r\n\r\nI desire to express my obligation to Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, of\r\nHarvard University, at whose suggestion I began this work and by whose\r\nkind aid and encouragement I have brought it to a close; also I have to\r\nthank the trustees of the John F. Slater Fund, whose appointment made it\r\npossible to test the conclusions of this study by the general principles\r\nlaid down in German universities.\r\n\r\n                                                 W.E.

Plan of the Monograph.\r\n  2. The Rise of the English Slave-Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Plan of the Monograph.~ This monograph proposes to set forth the\r\nefforts made in the United States of America, from early colonial times\r\nuntil the present, to limit and suppress the trade in slaves between\r\nAfrica and these shores.\r\n\r\nThe study begins with the colonial period, setting forth in brief the\r\nattitude of England and, more in detail, the attitude of the planting,\r\nfarming, and trading groups of colonies toward the slave-trade. It deals\r\nnext with the first concerted effort against the trade and with the\r\nfurther action of the individual States. The important work of the\r\nConstitutional Convention follows, together with the history of the\r\ntrade in that critical period which preceded the Act of 1807. The\r\nattempt to suppress the trade from 1807 to 1830 is next recounted. A\r\nchapter then deals with the slave-trade as an international problem.\r\nFinally the development of the crises up to the Civil War is studied,\r\ntogether with the steps leading to the final suppression; and a\r\nconcluding chapter seeks to sum up the results of the investigation.\r\nThroughout the monograph the institution of slavery and the interstate\r\nslave-trade are considered only incidentally.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~The Rise of the English Slave-Trade.~ Any attempt to consider the\r\nattitude of the English colonies toward the African slave-trade must be\r\nprefaced by a word as to the attitude of England herself and the\r\ndevelopment of the trade in her hands.[1]\r\n\r\nSir John Hawkins's celebrated voyage took place in 1562, but probably\r\nnot until 1631[2] did a regular chartered company undertake to carry on\r\nthe trade.[3] This company was unsuccessful,[4] and was eventually\r\nsucceeded by the \"Company of Royal Adventurers trading to Africa,\"\r\nchartered by Charles II. in 1662, and including the Queen Dowager and\r\nthe Duke of York.[5] The company contracted to supply the West Indies\r\nwith three thousand slaves annually; but contraband trade, misconduct,\r\nand war so reduced it that in 1672 it surrendered its charter to another\r\ncompany for £34,000.[6] This new corporation, chartered by Charles II.\r\nas the \"Royal African Company,\" proved more successful than its\r\npredecessors, and carried on a growing trade for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nIn 1698 Parliamentary interference with the trade began. By the Statute\r\n9 and 10 William and Mary, chapter 26, private traders, on payment of a\r\nduty of 10% on English goods exported to Africa, were allowed to\r\nparticipate in the trade. This was brought about by the clamor of the\r\nmerchants, especially the \"American Merchants,\" who \"in their Petition\r\nsuggest, that it would be a great Benefit to the Kingdom to secure the\r\nTrade by maintaining Forts and Castles there, with an equal Duty upon\r\nall Goods exported.\"[7] This plan, being a compromise between\r\nmaintaining the monopoly intact and entirely abolishing it, was adopted,\r\nand the statute declared the trade \"highly Beneficial and Advantageous\r\nto this Kingdom, and to the Plantations and Colonies thereunto\r\nbelonging.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus gained practically free admittance to the field, English\r\nmerchants sought to exclude other nations by securing a monopoly of the\r\nlucrative Spanish colonial slave-trade. Their object was finally\r\naccomplished by the signing of the Assiento in 1713.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Assiento was a treaty between England and Spain by which the latter\r\ngranted the former a monopoly of the Spanish colonial slave-trade for\r\nthirty years, and England engaged to supply the colonies within that\r\ntime with at least 144,000 slaves, at the rate of 4,800 per year.\r\nEngland was also to advance Spain 200,000 crowns, and to pay a duty of\r\n33½ crowns for each slave imported. The kings of Spain and England were\r\neach to receive one-fourth of the profits of the trade, and the Royal\r\nAfrican Company were authorized to import as many slaves as they wished\r\nabove the specified number in the first twenty-five years, and to sell\r\nthem, except in three ports, at any price they could get.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that, in the twenty years from 1713 to 1733, fifteen\r\nthousand slaves were annually imported into America by the English, of\r\nwhom from one-third to one-half went to the Spanish colonies.[9] To the\r\ncompany itself the venture proved a financial failure; for during the\r\nyears 1729-1750 Parliament assisted the Royal Company by annual grants\r\nwhich amounted to £90,000,[10] and by 1739 Spain was a creditor to the\r\nextent of £68,000, and threatened to suspend the treaty. The war\r\ninterrupted the carrying out of the contract, but the Peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle extended the limit by four years. Finally, October 5,\r\n1750, this privilege was waived for a money consideration paid to\r\nEngland; the Assiento was ended, and the Royal Company was bankrupt.\r\n\r\nBy the Statute 23 George II., chapter 31, the old company was dissolved\r\nand a new \"Company of Merchants trading to Africa\" erected in its\r\nstead.[11] Any merchant so desiring was allowed to engage in the trade\r\non payment of certain small duties, and such merchants formed a company\r\nheaded by nine directors. This marked the total abolition of monopoly in\r\nthe slave-trade, and was the form under which the trade was carried on\r\nuntil after the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nThat the slave-trade was the very life of the colonies had, by 1700,\r\nbecome an almost unquestioned axiom in British practical economics. The\r\ncolonists themselves declared slaves \"the strength and sinews of this\r\nwestern world,\"[12] and the lack of them \"the grand obstruction\"[13]\r\nhere, as the settlements \"cannot subsist without supplies of them.\"[14]\r\nThus, with merchants clamoring at home and planters abroad, it easily\r\nbecame the settled policy of England to encourage the slave-trade. Then,\r\ntoo, she readily argued that what was an economic necessity in Jamaica\r\nand the Barbadoes could scarcely be disadvantageous to Carolina,\r\nVirginia, or even New York. Consequently, the colonial governors were\r\ngenerally instructed to \"give all due encouragement and invitation to\r\nmerchants and others, ... and in particular to the royal African company\r\nof England.\"[15] Duties laid on the importer, and all acts in any way\r\nrestricting the trade, were frowned upon and very often disallowed.\r\n\"Whereas,\" ran Governor Dobbs's instructions, \"Acts have been passed in\r\nsome of our Plantations in America for laying duties on the importation\r\nand exportation of Negroes to the great discouragement of the Merchants\r\ntrading thither from the coast of Africa.... It is our Will and Pleasure\r\nthat you do not give your assent to or pass any Law imposing duties upon\r\nNegroes imported into our Province of North Carolina.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe exact proportions of the slave-trade to America can be but\r\napproximately determined. From 1680 to 1688 the African Company sent 249\r\nships to Africa, shipped there 60,783 Negro slaves, and after losing\r\n14,387 on the middle passage, delivered 46,396 in America. The trade\r\nincreased early in the eighteenth century, 104 ships clearing for Africa\r\nin 1701; it then dwindled until the signing of the Assiento, standing at\r\n74 clearances in 1724. The final dissolution of the monopoly in 1750\r\nled--excepting in the years 1754-57, when the closing of Spanish marts\r\nsensibly affected the trade--to an extraordinary development, 192\r\nclearances being made in 1771. The Revolutionary War nearly stopped the\r\ntraffic; but by 1786 the clearances had risen again to 146.\r\n\r\nTo these figures must be added the unregistered trade of Americans and\r\nforeigners. It is probable that about 25,000 slaves were brought to\r\nAmerica each year between 1698 and 1707. The importation then dwindled,\r\nbut rose after the Assiento to perhaps 30,000. The proportion, too, of\r\nthese slaves carried to the continent now began to increase. Of about\r\n20,000 whom the English annually imported from 1733 to 1766, South\r\nCarolina alone received some 3,000. Before the Revolution, the total\r\nexportation to America is variously estimated as between 40,000 and\r\n100,000 each year. Bancroft places the total slave population of the\r\ncontinental colonies at 59,000 in 1714, 78,000 in 1727, and 293,000 in\r\n1754. The census of 1790 showed 697,897 slaves in the United States.[17]\r\n\r\nIn colonies like those in the West Indies and in South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, the rapid importation into America of a multitude of savages\r\ngave rise to a system of slavery far different from that which the late\r\nCivil War abolished. The strikingly harsh and even inhuman slave codes\r\nin these colonies show this. Crucifixion, burning, and starvation were\r\nlegal modes of punishment.[18] The rough and brutal character of the\r\ntime and place was partly responsible for this, but a more decisive\r\nreason lay in the fierce and turbulent character of the imported\r\nNegroes. The docility to which long years of bondage and strict\r\ndiscipline gave rise was absent, and insurrections and acts of violence\r\nwere of frequent occurrence.[19] Again and again the danger of planters\r\nbeing \"cut off by their own negroes\"[20] is mentioned, both in the\r\nislands and on the continent. This condition of vague dread and unrest\r\nnot only increased the severity of laws and strengthened the police\r\nsystem, but was the prime motive back of all the earlier efforts to\r\ncheck the further importation of slaves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in New England and New York the Negroes were merely\r\nhouse servants or farm hands, and were treated neither better nor worse\r\nthan servants in general in those days. Between these two extremes, the\r\nsystem of slavery varied from a mild serfdom in Pennsylvania and New\r\nJersey to an aristocratic caste system in Maryland and Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] This account is based largely on the _Report of the Lords\r\n      of the Committee of Council_, etc. (London, 1789).\r\n\r\n  [2] African trading-companies had previously been erected\r\n     (e.g. by Elizabeth in 1585 and 1588, and by James I. in 1618);\r\n      but slaves are not specifically mentioned in their charters,\r\n      and they probably did not trade in slaves.

General Character of these Restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ~Character of these Colonies.~ The planting colonies are those\r\nSouthern settlements whose climate and character destined them to be the\r\nchief theatre of North American slavery. The early attitude of these\r\ncommunities toward the slave-trade is therefore of peculiar interest;\r\nfor their action was of necessity largely decisive for the future of the\r\ntrade and for the institution in North America. Theirs was the only\r\nsoil, climate, and society suited to slavery; in the other colonies,\r\nwith few exceptions, the institution was by these same factors doomed\r\nfrom the beginning. Hence, only strong moral and political motives could\r\nin the planting colonies overthrow or check a traffic so favored by the\r\nmother country.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ~Restrictions in Georgia.~ In Georgia we have an example of a\r\ncommunity whose philanthropic founders sought to impose upon it a code\r\nof morals higher than the colonists wished. The settlers of Georgia were\r\nof even worse moral fibre than their slave-trading and whiskey-using\r\nneighbors in Carolina and Virginia; yet Oglethorpe and the London\r\nproprietors prohibited from the beginning both the rum and the slave\r\ntraffic, refusing to \"suffer slavery (which is against the Gospel as\r\nwell as the fundamental law of England) to be authorised under our\r\nauthority.\"[1] The trustees sought to win the colonists over to their\r\nbelief by telling them that money could be better expended in\r\ntransporting white men than Negroes; that slaves would be a source of\r\nweakness to the colony; and that the \"Produces designed to be raised in\r\nthe Colony would not require such Labour as to make Negroes necessary\r\nfor carrying them on.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThis policy greatly displeased the colonists, who from 1735, the date of\r\nthe first law, to 1749, did not cease to clamor for the repeal of the\r\nrestrictions.[3] As their English agent said, they insisted that \"In\r\nSpight of all Endeavours to disguise this Point, it is as clear as Light\r\nitself, that Negroes are as essentially necessary to the Cultivation of\r\n_Georgia_, as Axes, Hoes, or any other Utensil of Agriculture.\"[4]\r\nMeantime, evasions and infractions of the laws became frequent and\r\nnotorious. Negroes were brought across from Carolina and \"hired\" for\r\nlife.[5] \"Finally, purchases were openly made in Savannah from African\r\ntraders: some seizures were made by those who opposed the principle, but\r\nas a majority of the magistrates were favorable to the introduction of\r\nslaves into the province, legal decisions were suspended from time to\r\ntime, and a strong disposition evidenced by the courts to evade the\r\noperation of the law.\"[6] At last, in 1749, the colonists prevailed on\r\nthe trustees and the government, and the trade was thrown open under\r\ncareful restrictions, which limited importation, required a registry and\r\nquarantine on all slaves brought in, and laid a duty.[7] It is probable,\r\nhowever, that these restrictions were never enforced, and that the trade\r\nthus established continued unchecked until the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ~Restrictions in South Carolina.~[8] South Carolina had the largest\r\nand most widely developed slave-trade of any of the continental\r\ncolonies. This was owing to the character of her settlers, her nearness\r\nto the West Indian slave marts, and the early development of certain\r\nstaple crops, such as rice, which were adapted to slave labor.[9]\r\nMoreover, this colony suffered much less interference from the home\r\ngovernment than many other colonies; thus it is possible here to trace\r\nthe untrammeled development of slave-trade restrictions in a typical\r\nplanting community.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1698 the slave-trade to South Carolina had reached such\r\nproportions that it was thought that \"the great number of negroes which\r\nof late have been imported into this Collony may endanger the safety\r\nthereof.\" The immigration of white servants was therefore encouraged by\r\na special law.[10] Increase of immigration reduced this disproportion,\r\nbut Negroes continued to be imported in such numbers as to afford\r\nconsiderable revenue from a moderate duty on them. About the time when\r\nthe Assiento was signed, the slave-trade so increased that, scarcely a\r\nyear after the consummation of that momentous agreement, two heavy duty\r\nacts were passed, because \"the number of Negroes do extremely increase\r\nin this Province, and through the afflicting providence of God, the\r\nwhite persons do not proportionately multiply, by reason whereof, the\r\nsafety of the said Province is greatly endangered.\"[11] The trade,\r\nhowever, by reason of the encouragement abroad and of increased business\r\nactivity in exporting naval stores at home, suffered scarcely any check,\r\nalthough repeated acts, reciting the danger incident to a \"great\r\nimportation of Negroes,\" were passed, laying high duties.[12] Finally,\r\nin 1717, an additional duty of £40,[13] although due in depreciated\r\ncurrency, succeeded so nearly in stopping the trade that, two years\r\nlater, all existing duties were repealed and one of £10 substituted.[14]\r\nThis continued during the time of resistance to the proprietary\r\ngovernment, but by 1734 the importation had again reached large\r\nproportions. \"We must therefore beg leave,\" the colonists write in that\r\nyear, \"to inform your Majesty, that, amidst our other perilous\r\ncircumstances, we are subject to many intestine dangers from the great\r\nnumber of negroes that are now among us, who amount at least to\r\ntwenty-two thousand persons, and are three to one of all your Majesty's\r\nwhite subjects in this province. Insurrections against us have been\r\noften attempted.\"[15] In 1740 an insurrection under a slave, Cato, at\r\nStono, caused such widespread alarm that a prohibitory duty of £100 was\r\nimmediately laid.[16] Importation was again checked; but in 1751 the\r\ncolony sought to devise a plan whereby the slightly restricted\r\nimmigration of Negroes should provide a fund to encourage the\r\nimportation of white servants, \"to prevent the mischiefs that may be\r\nattended by the great importation of negroes into this Province.\"[17]\r\nMany white servants were thus encouraged to settle in the colony; but so\r\nmuch larger was the influx of black slaves that the colony, in 1760,\r\ntotally prohibited the slave-trade. This act was promptly disallowed by\r\nthe Privy Council and the governor reprimanded;[18] but the colony\r\ndeclared that \"an importation of negroes, equal in number to what have\r\nbeen imported of late years, may prove of the most dangerous consequence\r\nin many respects to this Province, and the best way to obviate such\r\ndanger will be by imposing such an additional duty upon them as may\r\ntotally prevent the evils.\"[19] A prohibitive duty of £100 was\r\naccordingly imposed in 1764.[20] This duty probably continued until the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe war made a great change in the situation. It has been computed by\r\ngood judges that, between the years 1775 and 1783, the State of South\r\nCarolina lost twenty-five thousand Negroes, by actual hostilities,\r\nplunder of the British, runaways, etc. After the war the trade quickly\r\nrevived, and considerable revenue was raised from duty acts until 1787,\r\nwhen by act and ordinance the slave-trade was totally prohibited.[21]\r\nThis prohibition, by renewals from time to time, lasted until 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. ~Restrictions in North Carolina.~ In early times there were few\r\nslaves in North Carolina;[22] this fact, together with the troubled and\r\nturbulent state of affairs during the early colonial period, did not\r\nnecessitate the adoption of any settled policy toward slavery or the\r\nslave-trade. Later the slave-trade to the colony increased; but there is\r\nno evidence of any effort to restrict or in any way regulate it before\r\n1786, when it was declared that \"the importation of slaves into this\r\nState is productive of evil consequences and highly impolitic,\"[23] and\r\na prohibitive duty was laid on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. ~Restrictions in Virginia.~[24] Next to South Carolina, Virginia had\r\nprobably the largest slave-trade. Her situation, however, differed\r\nconsiderably from that of her Southern neighbor. The climate, the staple\r\ntobacco crop, and the society of Virginia were favorable to a system of\r\ndomestic slavery, but one which tended to develop into a patriarchal\r\nserfdom rather than into a slave-consuming industrial hierarchy. The\r\nlabor required by the tobacco crop was less unhealthy than that\r\nconnected with the rice crop, and the Virginians were, perhaps, on a\r\nsomewhat higher moral plane than the Carolinians. There was consequently\r\nno such insatiable demand for slaves in the larger colony. On the other\r\nhand, the power of the Virginia executive was peculiarly strong, and it\r\nwas not possible here to thwart the slave-trade policy of the home\r\ngovernment as easily as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nConsidering all these circumstances, it is somewhat difficult to\r\ndetermine just what was the attitude of the early Virginians toward the\r\nslave-trade. There is evidence, however, to show that although they\r\ndesired the slave-trade, the rate at which the Negroes were brought in\r\nsoon alarmed them. In 1710 a duty of £5 was laid on Negroes, but\r\nGovernor Spotswood \"soon perceived that the laying so high a Duty on\r\nNegros was intended to discourage the importation,\" and vetoed the\r\nmeasure.[25] No further restrictive legislation was attempted for some\r\nyears, but whether on account of the attitude of the governor or the\r\ndesire of the inhabitants, is not clear. With 1723 begins a series of\r\nacts extending down to the Revolution, which, so far as their contents\r\ncan be ascertained, seem to have been designed effectually to check the\r\nslave-trade. Some of these acts, like those of 1723 and 1727, were\r\nalmost immediately disallowed.[26] The Act of 1732 laid a duty of 5%,\r\nwhich was continued until 1769,[27] and all other duties were in\r\naddition to this; so that by such cumulative duties the rate on slaves\r\nreached 25% in 1755,[28] and 35% at the time of Braddock's\r\nexpedition.[29] These acts were found \"very burthensome,\" \"introductive\r\nof many frauds,\" and \"very inconvenient,\"[30] and were so far repealed\r\nthat by 1761 the duty was only 15%. As now the Burgesses became more\r\npowerful, two or more bills proposing restrictive duties were passed,\r\nbut disallowed.[31] By 1772 the anti-slave-trade feeling had become\r\nconsiderably developed, and the Burgesses petitioned the king, declaring\r\nthat \"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of\r\nAfrica hath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity, and\r\nunder its present encouragement, we have too much reason to fear _will\r\nendanger the very existence_ of your Majesty's American dominions....\r\nDeeply impressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech your\r\nMajesty to remove _all those restraints_ on your Majesty's governors of\r\nthis colony, _which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check\r\nso very pernicious a commerce_.\"[32]\r\n\r\nNothing further appears to have been done before the war. When, in 1776,\r\nthe delegates adopted a Frame of Government, it was charged in this\r\ndocument that the king had perverted his high office into a \"detestable\r\nand insupportable tyranny, by ... prompting our negroes to rise in arms\r\namong us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he\r\nhath refused us permission to exclude by law.\"[33] Two years later, in\r\n1778, an \"Act to prevent the further importation of Slaves\" stopped\r\ndefinitively the legal slave-trade to Virginia.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. ~Restrictions in Maryland.~[35] Not until the impulse of the Assiento\r\nhad been felt in America, did Maryland make any attempt to restrain a\r\ntrade from which she had long enjoyed a comfortable revenue. The Act of\r\n1717, laying a duty of 40_s._,[36] may have been a mild restrictive\r\nmeasure. The duties were slowly increased to 50_s._ in 1754,[37] and £4.\r\nin 1763.[38] In 1771 a prohibitive duty of £9 was laid;[39] and in 1783,\r\nafter the war, all importation by sea was stopped and illegally imported\r\nNegroes were freed.[40]\r\n\r\nCompared with the trade to Virginia and the Carolinas, the slave-trade\r\nto Maryland was small, and seems at no time to have reached proportions\r\nwhich alarmed the inhabitants. It was regulated to the economic demand\r\nby a slowly increasing tariff, and finally, after 1769, had nearly\r\nceased of its own accord before the restrictive legislation of\r\nRevolutionary times.[41] Probably the proximity of Maryland to Virginia\r\nmade an independent slave-trade less necessary to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. ~General Character of these Restrictions.~ We find in the planting\r\ncolonies all degrees of advocacy of the trade, from the passiveness of\r\nMaryland to the clamor of Georgia. Opposition to the trade did not\r\nappear in Georgia, was based almost solely on political fear of\r\ninsurrection in Carolina, and sprang largely from the same motive in\r\nVirginia, mingled with some moral repugnance. As a whole, it may be said\r\nthat whatever opposition to the slave-trade there was in the planting\r\ncolonies was based principally on the political fear of insurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Hoare, _Memoirs of Granville Sharp_ (1820), p. 157.

General Character of these Restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. ~Character of these Colonies.~ The colonies of this group, occupying\r\nthe central portion of the English possessions, comprise those\r\ncommunities where, on account of climate, physical characteristics, and\r\ncircumstances of settlement, slavery as an institution found but a\r\nnarrow field for development. The climate was generally rather cool for\r\nthe newly imported slaves, the soil was best suited to crops to which\r\nslave labor was poorly adapted, and the training and habits of the great\r\nbody of settlers offered little chance for the growth of a slave system.\r\nThese conditions varied, of course, in different colonies; but the\r\ngeneral statement applies to all. These communities of small farmers and\r\ntraders derived whatever opposition they had to the slave-trade from\r\nthree sorts of motives,--economic, political, and moral. First, the\r\nimportation of slaves did not pay, except to supply a moderate demand\r\nfor household servants. Secondly, these colonies, as well as those in\r\nthe South, had a wholesome political fear of a large servile population.\r\nThirdly, the settlers of many of these colonies were of sterner moral\r\nfibre than the Southern cavaliers and adventurers, and, in the absence\r\nof great counteracting motives, were more easily led to oppose the\r\ninstitution and the trade. Finally, it must be noted that these colonies\r\ndid not so generally regard themselves as temporary commercial\r\ninvestments as did Virginia and Carolina. Intending to found permanent\r\nStates, these settlers from the first more carefully studied the\r\nultimate interests of those States.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. ~The Dutch Slave-Trade.~ The Dutch seem to have commenced the\r\nslave-trade to the American continent, the Middle colonies and some of\r\nthe Southern receiving supplies from them. John Rolfe relates that the\r\nlast of August, 1619, there came to Virginia \"a dutch man of warre that\r\nsold us twenty Negars.\"[1] This was probably one of the ships of the\r\nnumerous private Dutch trading-companies which early entered into and\r\ndeveloped the lucrative African slave-trade. Ships sailed from Holland\r\nto Africa, got slaves in exchange for their goods, carried the slaves to\r\nthe West Indies or Brazil, and returned home laden with sugar.[2]\r\nThrough the enterprise of one of these trading-companies the settlement\r\nof New Amsterdam was begun, in 1614. In 1621 the private companies\r\ntrading in the West were all merged into the Dutch West India Company,\r\nand given a monopoly of American trade. This company was very active,\r\nsending in four years 15,430 Negroes to Brazil,[3] carrying on war with\r\nSpain, supplying even the English plantations,[4] and gradually becoming\r\nthe great slave carrier of the day.\r\n\r\nThe commercial supremacy of the Dutch early excited the envy and\r\nemulation of the English. The Navigation Ordinance of 1651 was aimed at\r\nthem, and two wars were necessary to wrest the slave-trade from them and\r\nplace it in the hands of the English. The final terms of peace among\r\nother things surrendered New Netherland to England, and opened the way\r\nfor England to become henceforth the world's greatest slave-trader.\r\nAlthough the Dutch had thus commenced the continental slave-trade, they\r\nhad not actually furnished a very large number of slaves to the English\r\ncolonies outside the West Indies. A small trade had, by 1698, brought a\r\nfew thousand to New York, and still fewer to New Jersey.[5] It was left\r\nto the English, with their strong policy in its favor, to develop this\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. ~Restrictions in New York.~[6] The early ordinances of the Dutch,\r\nlaying duties, generally of ten per cent, on slaves, probably proved\r\nburdensome to the trade, although this was not intentional.[7] The\r\nBiblical prohibition of slavery and the slave-trade, copied from New\r\nEngland codes into the Duke of York's Laws, had no practical\r\napplication,[8] and the trade continued to be encouraged in the\r\ngovernors' instructions. In 1709 a duty of £3 was laid on Negroes from\r\nelsewhere than Africa.[9] This was aimed at West India slaves, and was\r\nprohibitive. By 1716 the duty on all slaves was £1 12½_s._, which was\r\nprobably a mere revenue figure.[10] In 1728 a duty of 40_s._ was laid,\r\nto be continued until 1737.[11] It proved restrictive, however, and on\r\nthe \"humble petition of the Merchants and Traders of the City of\r\nBristol\" was disallowed in 1735, as \"greatly prejudicial to the Trade\r\nand Navigation of this Kingdom.\"[12] Governor Cosby was also reminded\r\nthat no duties on slaves payable by the importer were to be laid. Later,\r\nin 1753, the 40_s._ duty was restored, but under the increased trade of\r\nthose days was not felt.[13] No further restrictions seem to have been\r\nattempted until 1785, when the sale of slaves in the State was\r\nforbidden.[14]\r\n\r\nThe chief element of restriction in this colony appears to have been the\r\nshrewd business sense of the traders, who never flooded the slave\r\nmarket, but kept a supply sufficient for the slowly growing demand.\r\nBetween 1701 and 1726 only about 2,375 slaves were imported, and in 1774\r\nthe total slave population amounted to 21,149.[15] No restriction was\r\never put by New York on participation in the trade outside the colony,\r\nand in spite of national laws New York merchants continued to be engaged\r\nin this traffic even down to the Civil War.[16]\r\n\r\nVermont, who withdrew from New York in 1777, in her first\r\nConstitution[17] declared slavery illegal, and in 1786 stopped by law\r\nthe sale and transportation of slaves within her boundaries.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. ~Restrictions in Pennsylvania and Delaware.~[19] One of the first\r\nAmerican protests against the slave-trade came from certain German\r\nFriends, in 1688, at a Weekly Meeting held in Germantown, Pennsylvania.\r\n\"These are the reasons,\" wrote \"Garret henderich, derick up de graeff,\r\nFrancis daniell Pastorius, and Abraham up Den graef,\" \"why we are\r\nagainst the traffick of men-body, as followeth: Is there any that would\r\nbe done or handled at this manner?... Now, tho they are black, we cannot\r\nconceive there is more liberty to have them slaves, as it is to have\r\nother white ones. There is a saying, that we shall doe to all men like\r\nas we will be done ourselves; making no difference of what generation,\r\ndescent or colour they are. And those who steal or robb men, and those\r\nwho buy or purchase them, are they not all alike?\"[20] This little\r\nleaven helped slowly to work a revolution in the attitude of this great\r\nsect toward slavery and the slave-trade. The Yearly Meeting at first\r\npostponed the matter, \"It having so General a Relation to many other\r\nParts.\"[21] Eventually, however, in 1696, the Yearly Meeting advised\r\n\"That Friends be careful not to encourage the bringing in of any more\r\nNegroes.\"[22] This advice was repeated in stronger terms for a\r\nquarter-century,[23] and by that time Sandiford, Benezet, Lay, and\r\nWoolman had begun their crusade. In 1754 the Friends took a step farther\r\nand made the purchase of slaves a matter of discipline.[24] Four years\r\nlater the Yearly Meeting expressed itself clearly as \"against every\r\nbranch of this practice,\" and declared that if \"any professing with us\r\nshould persist to vindicate it, and be concerned in importing, selling\r\nor purchasing slaves, the respective Monthly Meetings to which they\r\nbelong should manifest their disunion with such persons.\"[25] Further,\r\nmanumission was recommended, and in 1776 made compulsory.[26] The effect\r\nof this attitude of the Friends was early manifested in the legislation\r\nof all the colonies where the sect was influential, and particularly in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOne of the first duty acts (1710) laid a restrictive duty of 40_s._ on\r\nslaves, and was eventually disallowed.[27] In 1712 William Southeby\r\npetitioned the Assembly totally to abolish slavery. This the Assembly\r\nnaturally refused to attempt; but the same year, in response to another\r\npetition \"signed by many hands,\" they passed an \"Act to prevent the\r\nImportation of Negroes and Indians,\"[28]--the first enactment of its\r\nkind in America. This act was inspired largely by the general fear of\r\ninsurrection which succeeded the \"Negro-plot\" of 1712 in New York. It\r\ndeclared: \"Whereas, divers Plots and Insurrections have frequently\r\nhappened, not only in the Islands but on the Main Land of _America_, by\r\nNegroes, which have been carried on so far that several of the\r\ninhabitants have been barbarously Murthered, an Instance whereof we have\r\nlately had in our Neighboring Colony of _New York_,\"[29] etc. It then\r\nproceeded to lay a prohibitive duty of £20 on all slaves imported. These\r\nacts were quickly disposed of in England. Three duty acts affecting\r\nNegroes, including the prohibitory act, were in 1713 disallowed, and it\r\nwas directed that \"the Dep^{ty} Gov^{r} Council and Assembly of\r\nPensilvania, be & they are hereby Strictly Enjoyned & required not to\r\npermit the said Laws ... to be from henceforward put in Execution.\"[30]\r\nThe Assembly repealed these laws, but in 1715 passed another laying a\r\nduty of £5, which was also eventually disallowed.[31] Other acts, the\r\nprovisions of which are not clear, were passed in 1720 and 1722,[32] and\r\nin 1725-1726 the duty on Negroes was raised to the restrictive figure of\r\n£10.[33] This duty, for some reason not apparent, was lowered to £2 in\r\n1729,[34] but restored again in 1761.[35] A struggle occurred over this\r\nlast measure, the Friends petitioning for it, and the Philadelphia\r\nmerchants against it, declaring that \"We, the subscribers, ever desirous\r\nto extend the Trade of this Province, have seen, for some time past,\r\nthe many inconveniencys the Inhabitants have suffer'd for want of\r\nLabourers and artificers, ... have for some time encouraged the\r\nimportation of Negroes;\" they prayed therefore at least for a delay in\r\npassing the measure.[36] The law, nevertheless, after much debate and\r\naltercation with the governor, finally passed.\r\n\r\nThese repeated acts nearly stopped the trade, and the manumission or\r\nsale of Negroes by the Friends decreased the number of slaves in the\r\nprovince. The rising spirit of independence enabled the colony, in 1773,\r\nto restore the prohibitive duty of £20 and make it perpetual.[37] After\r\nthe Revolution unpaid duties on slaves were collected and the slaves\r\nregistered,[38] and in 1780 an \"Act for the gradual Abolition of\r\nSlavery\" was passed.[39] As there were probably at no time before the\r\nwar more than 11,000 slaves in Pennsylvania,[40] the task thus\r\naccomplished was not so formidable as in many other States. As it was,\r\nparticipation in the slave-trade outside the colony was not prohibited\r\nuntil 1788.[41]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that in the original Swedish settlements along the\r\nDelaware slavery was prohibited.[42] This measure had, however, little\r\npractical effect; for as soon as the Dutch got control the slave-trade\r\nwas opened, although, as it appears, to no large extent. After the fall\r\nof the Dutch Delaware came into English hands. Not until 1775 do we find\r\nany legislation on the slave-trade. In that year the colony attempted\r\nto prohibit the importation of slaves, but the governor vetoed the\r\nbill.[43] Finally, in 1776 by the Constitution, and in 1787 by law,\r\nimportation and exportation were both prohibited.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. ~Restrictions in New Jersey.~[45] Although the freeholders of West\r\nNew Jersey declared, in 1676, that \"all and every Person and Persons\r\nInhabiting the said Province, shall, as far as in us lies, be free from\r\nOppression and Slavery,\"[46] yet Negro slaves are early found in the\r\ncolony.[47] The first restrictive measure was passed, after considerable\r\nfriction between the Council and the House, in 1713; it laid a duty of\r\n£10, currency.[48] Governor Hunter explained to the Board of Trade that\r\nthe bill was \"calculated to Encourage the Importation of white Servants\r\nfor the better Peopeling that Country.\"[49] How long this act continued\r\ndoes not appear; probably, not long. No further legislation was enacted\r\nuntil 1762 or 1763, when a prohibitive duty was laid on account of \"the\r\ninconvenience the Province is exposed to in lying open to the free\r\nimportation of Negros, when the Provinces on each side have laid duties\r\non them.\"[50] The Board of Trade declared that while they did not object\r\nto \"the Policy of imposing a reasonable duty,\" they could not assent to\r\nthis, and the act was disallowed.[51] The Act of 1769 evaded the\r\ntechnical objection of the Board of Trade, and laid a duty of £15 on the\r\nfirst purchasers of Negroes, because, as the act declared, \"Duties on\r\nthe Importation of Negroes in several of the neighbouring Colonies\r\nhath, on Experience, been found beneficial in the Introduction of sober,\r\nindustrious Foreigners.\"[52] In 1774 a bill which, according to the\r\nreport of the Council to Governor Morris, \"plainly intended an entire\r\nProhibition of all Slaves being imported from foreign Parts,\" was thrown\r\nout by the Council.[53] Importation was finally prohibited in 1786.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. ~General Character of these Restrictions.~ The main difference in\r\nmotive between the restrictions which the planting and the farming\r\ncolonies put on the African slave-trade, lay in the fact that the former\r\nlimited it mainly from fear of insurrection, the latter mainly because\r\nit did not pay. Naturally, the latter motive worked itself out with much\r\nless legislation than the former; for this reason, and because they held\r\na smaller number of slaves, most of these colonies have fewer actual\r\nstatutes than the Southern colonies. In Pennsylvania alone did this\r\ngeneral economic revolt against the trade acquire a distinct moral\r\ntinge. Although even here the institution was naturally doomed, yet the\r\nclear moral insight of the Quakers checked the trade much earlier than\r\nwould otherwise have happened. We may say, then, that the farming\r\ncolonies checked the slave-trade primarily from economic motives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Smith, _Generall Historie of Virginia_ (1626 and 1632), p. 126.\r\n\r\n  [2] Cf.

General Character of these Restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. ~Character of these Colonies.~ The rigorous climate of New England,\r\nthe character of her settlers, and their pronounced political views gave\r\nslavery an even slighter basis here than in the Middle colonies. The\r\nsignificance of New England in the African slave-trade does not\r\ntherefore lie in the fact that she early discountenanced the system of\r\nslavery and stopped importation; but rather in the fact that her\r\ncitizens, being the traders of the New World, early took part in the\r\ncarrying slave-trade and furnished slaves to the other colonies. An\r\ninquiry, therefore, into the efforts of the New England colonies to\r\nsuppress the slave-trade would fall naturally into two parts: first, and\r\nchiefly, an investigation of the efforts to stop the participation of\r\ncitizens in the carrying slave-trade; secondly, an examination of the\r\nefforts made to banish the slave-trade from New England soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. ~New England and the Slave-Trade.~ Vessels from Massachusetts,[1]\r\nRhode Island,[2] Connecticut,[3] and, to a less extent, from New\r\nHampshire,[4] were early and largely engaged in the carrying\r\nslave-trade. \"We know,\" said Thomas Pemberton in 1795, \"that a large\r\ntrade to Guinea was carried on for many years by the citizens of\r\nMassachusetts Colony, who were the proprietors of the vessels and their\r\ncargoes, out and home. Some of the slaves purchased in Guinea, and I\r\nsuppose the greatest part of them, were sold in the West Indies.\"[5] Dr.\r\nJohn Eliot asserted that \"it made a considerable branch of our\r\ncommerce.... It declined very little till the Revolution.\"[6] Yet the\r\ntrade of this colony was said not to equal that of Rhode Island. Newport\r\nwas the mart for slaves offered for sale in the North, and a point of\r\nreshipment for all slaves. It was principally this trade that raised\r\nNewport to her commercial importance in the eighteenth century.[7]\r\nConnecticut, too, was an important slave-trader, sending large numbers\r\nof horses and other commodities to the West Indies in exchange for\r\nslaves, and selling the slaves in other colonies.\r\n\r\nThis trade formed a perfect circle. Owners of slavers carried slaves to\r\nSouth Carolina, and brought home naval stores for their ship-building;\r\nor to the West Indies, and brought home molasses; or to other colonies,\r\nand brought home hogsheads. The molasses was made into the highly prized\r\nNew England rum, and shipped in these hogsheads to Africa for more\r\nslaves.[8] Thus, the rum-distilling industry indicates to some extent\r\nthe activity of New England in the slave-trade. In May, 1752, one\r\nCaptain Freeman found so many slavers fitting out that, in spite of the\r\nlarge importations of molasses, he could get no rum for his vessel.[9]\r\nIn Newport alone twenty-two stills were at one time running\r\ncontinuously;[10] and Massachusetts annually distilled 15,000 hogsheads\r\nof molasses into this \"chief manufacture.\"[11]\r\n\r\nTurning now to restrictive measures, we must first note the measures of\r\nthe slave-consuming colonies which tended to limit the trade. These\r\nmeasures, however, came comparatively late, were enforced with varying\r\ndegrees of efficiency, and did not seriously affect the slave-trade\r\nbefore the Revolution. The moral sentiment of New England put some check\r\nupon the trade. Although in earlier times the most respectable people\r\ntook ventures in slave-trading voyages, yet there gradually arose a\r\nmoral sentiment which tended to make the business somewhat\r\ndisreputable.[12] In the line, however, of definite legal enactments to\r\nstop New England citizens from carrying slaves from Africa to any place\r\nin the world, there were, before the Revolution, none. Indeed, not until\r\nthe years 1787-1788 was slave-trading in itself an indictable offence in\r\nany New England State.\r\n\r\nThe particular situation in each colony, and the efforts to restrict the\r\nsmall importing slave-trade of New England, can best be studied in a\r\nseparate view of each community.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. ~Restrictions in New Hampshire.~ The statistics of slavery in New\r\nHampshire show how weak an institution it always was in that colony.[13]\r\nConsequently, when the usual instructions were sent to Governor\r\nWentworth as to the encouragement he must give to the slave-trade, the\r\nHouse replied: \"We have considered his Maj^{ties} Instruction relating\r\nto an Impost on Negroes & Felons, to which this House answers, that\r\nthere never was any duties laid on either, by this Goverm^{t}, and so\r\nfew bro't in that it would not be worth the Publick notice, so as to\r\nmake an act concerning them.\"[14] This remained true for the whole\r\nhistory of the colony. Importation was never stopped by actual\r\nenactment, but was eventually declared contrary to the Constitution of\r\n1784.[15] The participation of citizens in the trade appears never to\r\nhave been forbidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. ~Restrictions in Massachusetts.~ The early Biblical codes of\r\nMassachusetts confined slavery to \"lawfull Captives taken in iust\r\nwarres, & such strangers as willingly selle themselves or are sold to\r\nus.\"[16] The stern Puritanism of early days endeavored to carry this out\r\nliterally, and consequently when a certain Captain Smith, about 1640,\r\nattacked an African village and brought some of the unoffending natives\r\nhome, he was promptly arrested. Eventually, the General Court ordered\r\nthe Negroes sent home at the colony's expense, \"conceiving themselues\r\nbound by y^e first oportunity to bear witnes against y^e haynos & crying\r\nsinn of manstealing, as also to P'scribe such timely redresse for what\r\nis past, & such a law for y^e future as may sufficiently deterr all\r\noth^{r}s belonging to us to have to do in such vile & most odious\r\ncourses, iustly abhored of all good & iust men.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe temptation of trade slowly forced the colony from this high moral\r\nground. New England ships were early found in the West Indian\r\nslave-trade, and the more the carrying trade developed, the more did the\r\nprofits of this branch of it attract Puritan captains. By the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century the slave-trade was openly recognized as\r\nlegitimate commerce; cargoes came regularly to Boston, and \"The\r\nmerchants of Boston quoted negroes, like any other merchandise demanded\r\nby their correspondents.\"[18] At the same time, the Puritan conscience\r\nbegan to rebel against the growth of actual slavery on New England soil.\r\nIt was a much less violent wrenching of moral ideas of right and wrong\r\nto allow Massachusetts men to carry slaves to South Carolina than to\r\nallow cargoes to come into Boston, and become slaves in Massachusetts.\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century, therefore, opposition arose to the\r\nfurther importation of Negroes, and in 1705 an act \"for the Better\r\nPreventing of a Spurious and Mixt Issue,\" laid a restrictive duty of £4\r\non all slaves imported.[19] One provision of this act plainly\r\nillustrates the attitude of Massachusetts: like the acts of many of the\r\nNew England colonies, it allowed a rebate of the whole duty on\r\nre-exportation. The harbors of New England were thus offered as a free\r\nexchange-mart for slavers. All the duty acts of the Southern and Middle\r\ncolonies allowed a rebate of one-half or three-fourths of the duty on\r\nthe re-exportation of the slave, thus laying a small tax on even\r\ntemporary importation.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1705 was evaded, but it was not amended until 1728, when the\r\npenalty for evasion was raised to £100.[20] The act remained in force,\r\nexcept possibly for one period of four years, until 1749. Meantime the\r\nmovement against importation grew. A bill \"for preventing the\r\nImportation of Slaves into this Province\" was introduced in the\r\nLegislature in 1767, but after strong opposition and disagreement\r\nbetween House and Council it was dropped.[21] In 1771 the struggle was\r\nrenewed. A similar bill passed, but was vetoed by Governor\r\nHutchinson.[22] The imminent war and the discussions incident to it had\r\nnow more and more aroused public opinion, and there were repeated\r\nattempts to gain executive consent to a prohibitory law. In 1774 such a\r\nbill was twice passed, but never received assent.[23]\r\n\r\nThe new Revolutionary government first met the subject in the case of\r\ntwo Negroes captured on the high seas, who were advertised for sale at\r\nSalem. A resolution was introduced into the Legislature, directing the\r\nrelease of the Negroes, and declaring \"That the selling and enslaving\r\nthe human species is a direct violation of the natural rights alike\r\nvested in all men by their Creator, and utterly inconsistent with the\r\navowed principles on which this, and the other United States, have\r\ncarried their struggle for liberty even to the last appeal.\" To this the\r\nCouncil would not consent; and the resolution, as finally passed, merely\r\nforbade the sale or ill-treatment of the Negroes.[24] Committees on the\r\nslavery question were appointed in 1776 and 1777,[25] and although a\r\nletter to Congress on the matter, and a bill for the abolition of\r\nslavery were reported, no decisive action was taken.\r\n\r\nAll such efforts were finally discontinued, as the system was already\r\npractically extinct in Massachusetts and the custom of importation had\r\nnearly ceased. Slavery was eventually declared by judicial decision to\r\nhave been abolished.[26] The first step toward stopping the\r\nparticipation of Massachusetts citizens in the slave-trade outside the\r\nState was taken in 1785, when a committee of inquiry was appointed by\r\nthe Legislature.[27] No act was, however, passed until 1788, when\r\nparticipation in the trade was prohibited, on pain of £50 forfeit for\r\nevery slave and £200 for every ship engaged.[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. ~Restrictions in Rhode Island.~ In 1652 Rhode Island passed a law\r\ndesigned to prohibit life slavery in the colony. It declared that\r\n\"Whereas, there is a common course practised amongst English men to buy\r\nnegers, to that end they may have them for service or slaves forever;\r\nfor the preventinge of such practices among us, let it be ordered, that\r\nno blacke mankind or white being forced by covenant bond, or otherwise,\r\nto serve any man or his assighnes longer than ten yeares, or untill they\r\ncome to bee twentie four yeares of age, if they bee taken in under\r\nfourteen, from the time of their cominge within the liberties of this\r\nCollonie. And at the end or terme of ten yeares to sett them free, as\r\nthe manner is with the English servants. And that man that will not let\r\nthem goe free, or shall sell them away elsewhere, to that end that they\r\nmay bee enslaved to others for a long time, hee or they shall forfeit to\r\nthe Collonie forty pounds.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThis law was for a time enforced,[30] but by the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century it had either been repealed or become a dead letter;\r\nfor the Act of 1708 recognized perpetual slavery, and laid an impost of\r\n£3 on Negroes imported.[31] This duty was really a tax on the transport\r\ntrade, and produced a steady income for twenty years.[32] From the year\r\n1700 on, the citizens of this State engaged more and more in the\r\ncarrying trade, until Rhode Island became the greatest slave-trader in\r\nAmerica. Although she did not import many slaves for her own use, she\r\nbecame the clearing-house for the trade of other colonies. Governor\r\nCranston, as early as 1708, reported that between 1698 and 1708 one\r\nhundred and three vessels were built in the State, all of which were\r\ntrading to the West Indies and the Southern colonies.[33] They took out\r\nlumber and brought back molasses, in most cases making a slave voyage in\r\nbetween. From this, the trade grew. Samuel Hopkins, about 1770, was\r\nshocked at the state of the trade: more than thirty distilleries were\r\nrunning in the colony, and one hundred and fifty vessels were in the\r\nslave-trade.[34] \"Rhode Island,\" said he, \"has been more deeply\r\ninterested in the slave-trade, and has enslaved more Africans than any\r\nother colony in New England.\" Later, in 1787, he wrote: \"The inhabitants\r\nof Rhode Island, especially those of Newport, have had by far the\r\ngreater share in this traffic, of all these United States. This trade in\r\nhuman species has been the first wheel of commerce in Newport, on which\r\nevery other movement in business has chiefly depended. That town has\r\nbeen built up, and flourished in times past, at the expense of the\r\nblood, the liberty, and happiness of the poor Africans; and the\r\ninhabitants have lived on this, and by it have gotten most of their\r\nwealth and riches.\"[35]\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1708 was poorly enforced. The \"good intentions\" of its\r\nframers \"were wholly frustrated\" by the clandestine \"hiding and\r\nconveying said negroes out of the town [Newport] into the country, where\r\nthey lie concealed.\"[36] The act was accordingly strengthened by the\r\nActs of 1712 and 1715, and made to apply to importations by land as well\r\nas by sea.[37] The Act of 1715, however, favored the trade by admitting\r\nAfrican Negroes free of duty. The chaotic state of Rhode Island did not\r\nallow England often to review her legislation; but as soon as the Act of\r\n1712 came to notice it was disallowed, and accordingly repealed in\r\n1732.[38] Whether the Act of 1715 remained, or whether any other duty\r\nact was passed, is not clear.\r\n\r\nWhile the foreign trade was flourishing, the influence of the Friends\r\nand of other causes eventually led to a movement against slavery as a\r\nlocal institution. Abolition societies multiplied, and in 1770 an\r\nabolition bill was ordered by the Assembly, but it was never passed.[39]\r\nFour years later the city of Providence resolved that \"as personal\r\nliberty is an essential part of the natural rights of mankind,\" the\r\nimportation of slaves and the system of slavery should cease in the\r\ncolony.[40] This movement finally resulted, in 1774, in an act\r\n\"prohibiting the importation of Negroes into this Colony,\"--a law which\r\ncuriously illustrated the attitude of Rhode Island toward the\r\nslave-trade. The preamble of the act declared: \"Whereas, the inhabitants\r\nof America are generally engaged in the preservation of their own rights\r\nand liberties, among which, that of personal freedom must be considered\r\nas the greatest; as those who are desirous of enjoying all the\r\nadvantages of liberty themselves, should be willing to extend personal\r\nliberty to others;--Therefore,\" etc. The statute then proceeded to enact\r\n\"that for the future, no negro or mulatto slave shall be brought into\r\nthis colony; and in case any slave shall hereafter be brought in, he or\r\nshe shall be, and are hereby, rendered immediately free....\" The logical\r\nending of such an act would have been a clause prohibiting the\r\nparticipation of Rhode Island citizens in the slave-trade. Not only was\r\nsuch a clause omitted, but the following was inserted instead:\r\n\"Provided, also, that nothing in this act shall extend, or be deemed to\r\nextend, to any negro or mulatto slave brought from the coast of Africa,\r\ninto the West Indies, on board any vessel belonging to this colony, and\r\nwhich negro or mulatto slave could not be disposed of in the West\r\nIndies, but shall be brought into this colony. Provided, that the owner\r\nof such negro or mulatto slave give bond ... that such negro or mulatto\r\nslave shall be exported out of the colony, within one year from the date\r\nof such bond; if such negro or mulatto be alive, and in a condition to\r\nbe removed.\"[41]\r\n\r\nIn 1779 an act to prevent the sale of slaves out of the State was\r\npassed,[42] and in 1784, an act gradually to abolish slavery.[43] Not\r\nuntil 1787 did an act pass to forbid participation in the slave-trade.\r\nThis law laid a penalty of £100 for every slave transported and £1000\r\nfor every vessel so engaged.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. ~Restrictions in Connecticut.~ Connecticut, in common with the other\r\ncolonies of this section, had a trade for many years with the West\r\nIndian slave markets; and though this trade was much smaller than that\r\nof the neighboring colonies, yet many of her citizens were engaged in\r\nit. A map of Middletown at the time of the Revolution gives, among one\r\nhundred families, three slave captains and \"three notables\" designated\r\nas \"slave-dealers.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThe actual importation was small,[46] and almost entirely unrestricted\r\nbefore the Revolution, save by a few light, general duty acts. In 1774\r\nthe further importation of slaves was prohibited, because \"the increase\r\nof slaves in this Colony is injurious to the poor and inconvenient.\" The\r\nlaw prohibited importation under any pretext by a penalty of £100 per\r\nslave.[47] This was re-enacted in 1784, and provisions were made for the\r\nabolition of slavery.[48] In 1788 participation in the trade was\r\nforbidden, and the penalty placed at £50 for each slave and £500 for\r\neach ship engaged.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. ~General Character of these Restrictions.~ Enough has already been\r\nsaid to show, in the main, the character of the opposition to the\r\nslave-trade in New England. The system of slavery had, on this soil and\r\namid these surroundings, no economic justification, and the small number\r\nof Negroes here furnished no political arguments against them. The\r\nopposition to the importation was therefore from the first based solely\r\non moral grounds, with some social arguments. As to the carrying trade,\r\nhowever, the case was different. Here, too, a feeble moral opposition\r\nwas early aroused, but it was swept away by the immense economic\r\nadvantages of the slave traffic to a thrifty seafaring community of\r\ntraders. This trade no moral suasion, not even the strong \"Liberty\" cry\r\nof the Revolution, was able wholly to suppress, until the closing of the\r\nWest Indian and Southern markets cut off the demand for slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Cf.

She was fitted out in March, 1752, and carried,\r\n      beside the captain, two mates and six men, and a cargo of\r\n      8,220 gallons of rum, together with \"African\" iron, flour,\r\n      pots, tar, sugar, and provisions, shackles, shirts, and water.\r\n      Proceeding to Africa, the captain after some difficulty sold\r\n      his cargo for slaves, and in April, 1753, he is expected in\r\n      Barbadoes, as the consignees write.

After a\r\n      stormy and dangerous voyage, Captain Lindsay arrived, June 17,\r\n      1753, with fifty-six slaves, \"all in helth & fatt.\" He also\r\n      had 40 oz. of gold dust, and 8 or 9 cwt. of pepper.

The Action of the Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. ~The Situation in 1774.~ In the individual efforts of the various\r\ncolonies to suppress the African slave-trade there may be traced certain\r\ngeneral movements. First, from 1638 to 1664, there was a tendency to\r\ntake a high moral stand against the traffic. This is illustrated in the\r\nlaws of New England, in the plans for the settlement of Delaware and,\r\nlater, that of Georgia, and in the protest of the German Friends. The\r\nsecond period, from about 1664 to 1760, has no general unity, but is\r\nmarked by statutes laying duties varying in design from encouragement to\r\nabsolute prohibition, by some cases of moral opposition, and by the slow\r\nbut steady growth of a spirit unfavorable to the long continuance of the\r\ntrade. The last colonial period, from about 1760 to 1787, is one of\r\npronounced effort to regulate, limit, or totally prohibit the traffic.\r\nBeside these general movements, there are many waves of legislation,\r\neasily distinguishable, which rolled over several or all of the colonies\r\nat various times, such as the series of high duties following the\r\nAssiento, and the acts inspired by various Negro \"plots.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, the laws of the colonies before 1774 had no\r\nnational unity, the peculiar circumstances of each colony determining\r\nits legislation. With the outbreak of the Revolution came unison in\r\naction with regard to the slave-trade, as with regard to other matters,\r\nwhich may justly be called national. It was, of course, a critical\r\nperiod,--a period when, in the rapid upheaval of a few years, the\r\ncomplicated and diverse forces of decades meet, combine, act, and react,\r\nuntil the resultant seems almost the work of chance. In the settlement\r\nof the fate of slavery and the slave-trade, however, the real crisis\r\ncame in the calm that succeeded the storm, in that day when, in the\r\nopinion of most men, the question seemed already settled. And indeed it\r\nneeded an exceptionally clear and discerning mind, in 1787, to deny that\r\nslavery and the slave-trade in the United States of America were doomed\r\nto early annihilation. It seemed certainly a legitimate deduction from\r\nthe history of the preceding century to conclude that, as the system had\r\nrisen, flourished, and fallen in Massachusetts, New York, and\r\nPennsylvania, and as South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland were\r\napparently following in the same legislative path, the next generation\r\nwould in all probability witness the last throes of the system on our\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the problem had its uncertain quantities. The motives of the\r\nlaw-makers in South Carolina and Pennsylvania were dangerously\r\ndifferent; the century of industrial expansion was slowly dawning and\r\nawakening that vast economic revolution in which American slavery was to\r\nplay so prominent and fatal a rôle; and, finally, there were already in\r\nthe South faint signs of a changing moral attitude toward slavery, which\r\nwould no longer regard the system as a temporary makeshift, but rather\r\nas a permanent though perhaps unfortunate necessity. With regard to the\r\nslave-trade, however, there appeared to be substantial unity of opinion;\r\nand there were, in 1787, few things to indicate that a cargo of five\r\nhundred African slaves would openly be landed in Georgia in 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n24. ~The Condition of the Slave-Trade.~ In 1760 England, the chief\r\nslave-trading nation, was sending on an average to Africa 163 ships\r\nannually, with a tonnage of 18,000 tons, carrying exports to the value\r\nof £163,818. Only about twenty of these ships regularly returned to\r\nEngland. Most of them carried slaves to the West Indies, and returned\r\nladen with sugar and other products. Thus may be formed some idea of the\r\nsize and importance of the slave-trade at that time, although for a\r\ncomplete view we must add to this the trade under the French,\r\nPortuguese, Dutch, and Americans. The trade fell off somewhat toward\r\n1770, but was flourishing again when the Revolution brought a sharp and\r\nserious check upon it, bringing down the number of English slavers,\r\nclearing, from 167 in 1774 to 28 in 1779, and the tonnage from 17,218 to\r\n3,475 tons. After the war the trade gradually recovered, and by 1786 had\r\nreached nearly its former extent. In 1783 the British West Indies\r\nreceived 16,208 Negroes from Africa, and by 1787 the importation had\r\nincreased to 21,023. In this latter year it was estimated that the\r\nBritish were taking annually from Africa 38,000 slaves; the French,\r\n20,000; the Portuguese, 10,000; the Dutch and Danes, 6,000; a total of\r\n74,000. Manchester alone sent £180,000 annually in goods to Africa in\r\nexchange for Negroes.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. ~The Slave-Trade and the \"Association.\"~ At the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution six main reasons, some of which were old and of slow growth,\r\nothers peculiar to the abnormal situation of that time, led to concerted\r\naction against the slave-trade. The first reason was the economic\r\nfailure of slavery in the Middle and Eastern colonies; this gave rise to\r\nthe presumption that like failure awaited the institution in the South.\r\nSecondly, the new philosophy of \"Freedom\" and the \"Rights of man,\" which\r\nformed the corner-stone of the Revolution, made the dullest realize\r\nthat, at the very least, the slave-trade and a struggle for \"liberty\"\r\nwere not consistent. Thirdly, the old fear of slave insurrections, which\r\nhad long played so prominent a part in legislation, now gained new power\r\nfrom the imminence of war and from the well-founded fear that the\r\nBritish might incite servile uprisings. Fourthly, nearly all the\r\nAmerican slave markets were, in 1774-1775, overstocked with slaves, and\r\nconsequently many of the strongest partisans of the system were \"bulls\"\r\non the market, and desired to raise the value of their slaves by at\r\nleast a temporary stoppage of the trade. Fifthly, since the vested\r\ninterests of the slave-trading merchants were liable to be swept away by\r\nthe opening of hostilities, and since the price of slaves was low,[2]\r\nthere was from this quarter little active opposition to a cessation of\r\nthe trade for a season. Finally, it was long a favorite belief of the\r\nsupporters of the Revolution that, as English exploitation of colonial\r\nresources had caused the quarrel, the best weapon to bring England to\r\nterms was the economic expedient of stopping all commercial intercourse\r\nwith her. Since, then, the slave-trade had ever formed an important part\r\nof her colonial traffic, it was one of the first branches of commerce\r\nwhich occurred to the colonists as especially suited to their ends.[3]\r\n\r\nSuch were the complicated moral, political, and economic motives which\r\nunderlay the first national action against the slave-trade. This action\r\nwas taken by the \"Association,\" a union of the colonies entered into to\r\nenforce the policy of stopping commercial intercourse with England. The\r\nmovement was not a great moral protest against an iniquitous traffic;\r\nalthough it had undoubtedly a strong moral backing, it was primarily a\r\ntemporary war measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. ~The Action of the Colonies.~ The earlier and largely abortive\r\nattempts to form non-intercourse associations generally did not mention\r\nslaves specifically, although the Virginia House of Burgesses, May 11,\r\n1769, recommended to merchants and traders, among other things, to\r\nagree, \"That they will not import any slaves, or purchase any imported\r\nafter the first day of November next, until the said acts are\r\nrepealed.\"[4] Later, in 1774, when a Faneuil Hall meeting started the\r\nfirst successful national attempt at non-intercourse, the slave-trade,\r\nbeing at the time especially flourishing, received more attention. Even\r\nthen slaves were specifically mentioned in the resolutions of but three\r\nStates. Rhode Island recommended a stoppage of \"all trade with Great\r\nBritain, Ireland, Africa and the West Indies.\"[5] North Carolina, in\r\nAugust, 1774, resolved in convention \"That we will not import any slave\r\nor slaves, or purchase any slave or slaves, imported or brought into\r\nthis Province by others, from any part of the world, after the first day\r\nof _November_ next.\"[6] Virginia gave the slave-trade especial\r\nprominence, and was in reality the leading spirit to force her views on\r\nthe Continental Congress. The county conventions of that colony first\r\ntook up the subject. Fairfax County thought \"that during our present\r\ndifficulties and distress, no slaves ought to be imported,\" and said:\r\n\"We take this opportunity of declaring our most earnest wishes to see an\r\nentire stop forever put to such a wicked, cruel, and unnatural\r\ntrade.\"[7] Prince George and Nansemond Counties resolved \"That the\r\n_African_ trade is injurious to this Colony, obstructs the population of\r\nit by freemen, prevents manufacturers and other useful emigrants from\r\n_Europe_ from settling amongst us, and occasions an annual increase of\r\nthe balance of trade against this Colony.\"[8] The Virginia colonial\r\nconvention, August, 1774, also declared: \"We will neither ourselves\r\nimport, nor purchase any slave or slaves imported by any other person,\r\nafter the first day of _November_ next, either from _Africa_, the _West\r\nIndies_, or any other place.\"[9]\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, at the convention July 6, 1774, decided opposition to\r\nthe non-importation scheme was manifested, though how much this was due\r\nto the slave-trade interest is not certain. Many of the delegates wished\r\nat least to limit the powers of their representatives, and the\r\nCharleston Chamber of Commerce flatly opposed the plan of an\r\n\"Association.\" Finally, however, delegates with full powers were sent to\r\nCongress. The arguments leading to this step were not in all cases on\r\nthe score of patriotism; a Charleston manifesto argued: \"The planters\r\nare greatly in arrears to the merchants; a stoppage of importation would\r\ngive them all an opportunity to extricate themselves from debt. The\r\nmerchants would have time to settle their accounts, and be ready with\r\nthe return of liberty to renew trade.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. ~The Action of the Continental Congress.~ The first Continental\r\nCongress met September 5, 1774, and on September 22 recommended\r\nmerchants to send no more orders for foreign goods.[11] On September 27\r\n\"Mr. Lee made a motion for a non-importation,\" and it was unanimously\r\nresolved to import no goods from Great Britain after December 1,\r\n1774.[12] Afterward, Ireland and the West Indies were also included, and\r\na committee consisting of Low of New York, Mifflin of Pennsylvania, Lee\r\nof Virginia, and Johnson of Connecticut were appointed \"to bring in a\r\nPlan for carrying into Effect the Non-importation, Non-consumption, and\r\nNon-exportation resolved on.\"[13] The next move was to instruct this\r\ncommittee to include in the proscribed articles, among other things,\r\n\"Molasses, Coffee or Piemento from the _British_ Plantations or from\r\n_Dominica_,\"--a motion which cut deep into the slave-trade circle of\r\ncommerce, and aroused some opposition. \"Will, can, the people bear a\r\ntotal interruption of the West India trade?\" asked Low of New York; \"Can\r\nthey live without rum, sugar, and molasses? Will not this impatience and\r\nvexation defeat the measure?\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe committee finally reported, October 12, 1774, and after three days'\r\ndiscussion and amendment the proposal passed. This document, after a\r\nrecital of grievances, declared that, in the opinion of the colonists, a\r\nnon-importation agreement would best secure redress; goods from Great\r\nBritain, Ireland, the East and West Indies, and Dominica were excluded;\r\nand it was resolved that \"We will neither import, nor purchase any Slave\r\nimported after the First Day of _December_ next; after which Time, we\r\nwill wholly discontinue the Slave Trade, and will neither be concerned\r\nin it ourselves, nor will we hire our Vessels, nor sell our Commodities\r\nor Manufactures to those who are concerned in it.\"[15]\r\n\r\nStrong and straightforward as this resolution was, time unfortunately\r\nproved that it meant very little. Two years later, in this same\r\nCongress, a decided opposition was manifested to branding the\r\nslave-trade as inhuman, and it was thirteen years before South Carolina\r\nstopped the slave-trade or Massachusetts prohibited her citizens from\r\nengaging in it. The passing of so strong a resolution must be explained\r\nby the motives before given, by the character of the drafting\r\ncommittee, by the desire of America in this crisis to appear well\r\nbefore the world, and by the natural moral enthusiasm aroused by the\r\nimminence of a great national struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n28. ~Reception of the Slave-Trade Resolution.~ The unanimity with which\r\nthe colonists received this \"Association\" is not perhaps as remarkable\r\nas the almost entire absence of comment on the radical slave-trade\r\nclause. A Connecticut town-meeting in December, 1774, noticed \"with\r\nsingular pleasure ... the second Article of the Association, in which it\r\nis agreed to import no more Negro Slaves.\"[16] This comment appears to\r\nhave been almost the only one. There were in various places some\r\nevidences of disapproval; but only in the State of Georgia was this\r\nwidespread and determined, and based mainly on the slave-trade\r\nclause.[17] This opposition delayed the ratification meeting until\r\nJanuary 18, 1775, and then delegates from but five of the twelve\r\nparishes appeared, and many of these had strong instructions against the\r\napproval of the plan. Before this meeting could act, the governor\r\nadjourned it, on the ground that it did not represent the province. Some\r\nof the delegates signed an agreement, one article of which promised to\r\nstop the importation of slaves March 15, 1775, i.e., four months later\r\nthan the national \"Association\" had directed. This was not, of course,\r\nbinding on the province; and although a town like Darien might declare\r\n\"our disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural practice of Slavery\r\nin _America_\"[18] yet the powerful influence of Savannah was \"not likely\r\nsoon to give matters a favourable turn. The importers were mostly\r\nagainst any interruption, and the consumers very much divided.\"[19] Thus\r\nthe efforts of this Assembly failed, their resolutions being almost\r\nunknown, and, as a gentleman writes, \"I hope for the honour of the\r\nProvince ever will remain so.\"[20] The delegates to the Continental\r\nCongress selected by this rump assembly refused to take their seats.\r\nMeantime South Carolina stopped trade with Georgia, because it \"hath not\r\nacceded to the Continental Association,\"[21] and the single Georgia\r\nparish of St. Johns appealed to the second Continental Congress to\r\nexcept it from the general boycott of the colony. This county had\r\nalready resolved not to \"purchase any Slave imported at _Savannah_\r\n(large Numbers of which we understand are there expected) till the Sense\r\nof Congress shall be made known to us.\"[22]\r\n\r\nMay 17, 1775, Congress resolved unanimously \"That all exportations to\r\n_Quebec_, _Nova-Scotia_, the Island of _St. John's_, _Newfoundland_,\r\n_Georgia_, except the Parish of _St. John's_, and to _East_ and _West\r\nFlorida_, immediately cease.\"[23] These measures brought the refractory\r\ncolony to terms, and the Provincial Congress, July 4, 1775, finally\r\nadopted the \"Association,\" and resolved, among other things, \"That we\r\nwill neither import or purchase any Slave imported from Africa, or\r\nelsewhere, after this day.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThe non-importation agreement was in the beginning, at least, well\r\nenforced by the voluntary action of the loosely federated nation. The\r\nslave-trade clause seems in most States to have been observed with the\r\nothers. In South Carolina \"a cargo of near three hundred slaves was sent\r\nout of the Colony by the consignee, as being interdicted by the second\r\narticle of the Association.\"[25] In Virginia the vigilance committee of\r\nNorfolk \"hold up for your just indignation Mr. _John Brown_, Merchant,\r\nof this place,\" who has several times imported slaves from Jamaica; and\r\nhe is thus publicly censured \"to the end that all such foes to the\r\nrights of _British America_ may be publickly known ... as the enemies of\r\n_American_ Liberty, and that every person may henceforth break off all\r\ndealings with him.\"[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n29. ~Results of the Resolution.~ The strain of war at last proved too\r\nmuch for this voluntary blockade, and after some hesitancy Congress,\r\nApril 3, 1776, resolved to allow the importation of articles not the\r\ngrowth or manufacture of Great Britain, except tea. They also voted\r\n\"That no slaves be imported into any of the thirteen United\r\nColonies.\"[27] This marks a noticeable change of attitude from the\r\nstrong words of two years previous: the former was a definitive promise;\r\nthis is a temporary resolve, which probably represented public opinion\r\nmuch better than the former. On the whole, the conclusion is inevitably\r\nforced on the student of this first national movement against the\r\nslave-trade, that its influence on the trade was but temporary and\r\ninsignificant, and that at the end of the experiment the outlook for the\r\nfinal suppression of the trade was little brighter than before. The\r\nwhole movement served as a sort of social test of the power and\r\nimportance of the slave-trade, which proved to be far more powerful than\r\nthe platitudes of many of the Revolutionists had assumed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the movement on the slave-trade in general was to begin,\r\npossibly a little earlier than otherwise would have been the case, that\r\ntemporary breaking up of the trade which the war naturally caused.\r\n\"There was a time, during the late war,\" says Clarkson, \"when the slave\r\ntrade may be considered as having been nearly abolished.\"[28] The prices\r\nof slaves rose correspondingly high, so that smugglers made\r\nfortunes.[29] It is stated that in the years 1772-1778 slave merchants\r\nof Liverpool failed for the sum of £710,000.[30] All this, of course,\r\nmight have resulted from the war, without the \"Association;\" but in the\r\nlong run the \"Association\" aided in frustrating the very designs which\r\nthe framers of the first resolve had in mind; for the temporary stoppage\r\nin the end created an extraordinary demand for slaves, and led to a\r\nslave-trade after the war nearly as large as that before.\r\n\r\n\r\n30. ~The Slave-Trade and Public Opinion after the War.~ The Declaration\r\nof Independence showed a significant drift of public opinion from the\r\nfirm stand taken in the \"Association\" resolutions. The clique of\r\npolitical philosophers to which Jefferson belonged never imagined the\r\ncontinued existence of the country with slavery. It is well known that\r\nthe first draft of the Declaration contained a severe arraignment of\r\nGreat Britain as the real promoter of slavery and the slave-trade in\r\nAmerica. In it the king was charged with waging \"cruel war against human\r\nnature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in\r\nthe persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating and\r\ncarrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable\r\ndeath in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the\r\nopprobrium of _infidel_ powers, is the warfare of the _Christian_ king\r\nof Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where _men_ should be\r\nbought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every\r\nlegislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce.\r\nAnd that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished\r\ndie, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and\r\nto purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the\r\npeople on whom he also obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes\r\ncommitted against the _liberties_ of one people with crimes which he\r\nurges them to commit against the _lives_ of another.\"[31]\r\n\r\nTo this radical and not strictly truthful statement, even the large\r\ninfluence of the Virginia leaders could not gain the assent of the\r\ndelegates in Congress. The afflatus of 1774 was rapidly subsiding, and\r\nchanging economic conditions had already led many to look forward to a\r\nday when the slave-trade could successfully be reopened. More important\r\nthan this, the nation as a whole was even less inclined now than in 1774\r\nto denounce the slave-trade uncompromisingly. Jefferson himself says\r\nthat this clause \"was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia, who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves,\r\nand who, on the contrary, still wished to continue it. Our northern\r\nbrethren also, I believe,\" said he, \"felt a little tender under those\r\ncensures; for though their people had very few slaves themselves, yet\r\nthey had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others.\"[32]\r\n\r\nAs the war slowly dragged itself to a close, it became increasingly\r\nevident that a firm moral stand against slavery and the slave-trade was\r\nnot a probability. The reaction which naturally follows a period of\r\nprolonged and exhausting strife for high political principles now set\r\nin. The economic forces of the country, which had suffered most, sought\r\nto recover and rearrange themselves; and all the selfish motives that\r\nimpelled a bankrupt nation to seek to gain its daily bread did not long\r\nhesitate to demand a reopening of the profitable African slave-trade.\r\nThis demand was especially urgent from the fact that the slaves, by\r\npillage, flight, and actual fighting, had become so reduced in numbers\r\nduring the war that an urgent demand for more laborers was felt in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the revival of the trade was naturally a matter of some\r\ndifficulty, as the West India circuit had been cut off, leaving no\r\nresort except to contraband traffic and the direct African trade. The\r\nEnglish slave-trade after the peace \"returned to its former state,\" and\r\nwas by 1784 sending 20,000 slaves annually to the West Indies.[33] Just\r\nhow large the trade to the continent was at this time there are few\r\nmeans of ascertaining; it is certain that there was a general reopening\r\nof the trade in the Carolinas and Georgia, and that the New England\r\ntraders participated in it. This traffic undoubtedly reached\r\nconsiderable proportions; and through the direct African trade and the\r\nillicit West India trade many thousands of Negroes came into the United\r\nStates during the years 1783-1787.[34]\r\n\r\nMeantime there was slowly arising a significant divergence of opinion on\r\nthe subject. Probably the whole country still regarded both slavery and\r\nthe slave-trade as temporary; but the Middle States expected to see the\r\nabolition of both within a generation, while the South scarcely thought\r\nit probable to prohibit even the slave-trade in that short time. Such a\r\ndifference might, in all probability, have been satisfactorily adjusted,\r\nif both parties had recognized the real gravity of the matter. As it\r\nwas, both regarded it as a problem of secondary importance, to be solved\r\nafter many other more pressing ones had been disposed of. The\r\nanti-slavery men had seen slavery die in their own communities, and\r\nexpected it to die the same way in others, with as little active effort\r\non their own part. The Southern planters, born and reared in a slave\r\nsystem, thought that some day the system might change, and possibly\r\ndisappear; but active effort to this end on their part was ever farthest\r\nfrom their thoughts. Here, then, began that fatal policy toward slavery\r\nand the slave-trade that characterized the nation for three-quarters of\r\na century, the policy of _laissez-faire, laissez-passer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. ~The Action of the Confederation.~ The slave-trade was hardly\r\ntouched upon in the Congress of the Confederation, except in the\r\nordinance respecting the capture of slaves, and on the occasion of the\r\nQuaker petition against the trade, although, during the debate on the\r\nArticles of Confederation, the counting of slaves as well as of freemen\r\nin the apportionment of taxes was urged as a measure that would check\r\nfurther importation of Negroes. \"It is our duty,\" said Wilson of\r\nPennsylvania, \"to lay every discouragement on the importation of slaves;\r\nbut this amendment [i.e., to count two slaves as one freeman] would give\r\nthe _jus trium liberorum_ to him who would import slaves.\"[35] The\r\nmatter was finally compromised by apportioning requisitions according to\r\nthe value of land and buildings.\r\n\r\nAfter the Articles went into operation, an ordinance in regard to the\r\nrecapture of fugitive slaves provided that, if the capture was made on\r\nthe sea below high-water mark, and the Negro was not claimed, he should\r\nbe freed. Matthews of South Carolina demanded the yeas and nays on this\r\nproposition, with the result that only the vote of his State was\r\nrecorded against it.[36]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, October 3, 1783, a deputation from the Yearly Meeting of the\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware Friends asked leave to present a\r\npetition. Leave was granted the following day,[37] but no further minute\r\nappears. According to the report of the Friends, the petition was\r\nagainst the slave-trade; and \"though the Christian rectitude of the\r\nconcern was by the Delegates generally acknowledged, yet not being\r\nvested with the powers of legislation, they declined promoting any\r\npublic remedy against the gross national iniquity of trafficking in the\r\npersons of fellow-men.\"[38]\r\n\r\nThe only legislative activity in regard to the trade during the\r\nConfederation was taken by the individual States.[39] Before 1778\r\nConnecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia had by law\r\nstopped the further importation of slaves, and importation had\r\npractically ceased in all the New England and Middle States, including\r\nMaryland. In consequence of the revival of the slave-trade after the\r\nWar, there was then a lull in State activity until 1786, when North\r\nCarolina laid a prohibitive duty, and South Carolina, a year later,\r\nbegan her series of temporary prohibitions. In 1787-1788 the New England\r\nStates forbade the participation of their citizens in the traffic. It\r\nwas this wave of legislation against the traffic which did so much to\r\nblind the nation as to the strong hold which slavery still had on the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] These figures are from the _Report of the Lords of the\r\n      Committee of Council_, etc. (London, 1789).\r\n\r\n  [2] Sheffield, _Observations on American Commerce_, p. 28;\r\n      P.L.

Consequently, neither slavery nor the\r\nslave-trade is specifically mentioned in the delegates' credentials of\r\nany of the States, nor in Randolph's, Pinckney's, or Hamilton's plans,\r\nnor in Paterson's propositions. Indeed, the debate from May 14 to June\r\n19, when the Committee of the Whole reported, touched the subject only\r\nin the matter of the ratio of representation of slaves. With this same\r\nexception, the report of the Committee of the Whole contained no\r\nreference to slavery or the slave-trade, and the twenty-three\r\nresolutions of the Convention referred to the Committee of Detail, July\r\n23 and 26, maintain the same silence.\r\n\r\nThe latter committee, consisting of Rutledge, Randolph, Gorham,\r\nEllsworth, and Wilson, reported a draft of the Constitution August 6,\r\n1787. The committee had, in its deliberations, probably made use of a\r\ndraft of a national Constitution made by Edmund Randolph.[1] One clause\r\nof this provided that \"no State shall lay a duty on imports;\" and, also,\r\n\"1. No duty on exports. 2. No prohibition on such inhabitants as the\r\nUnited States think proper to admit. 3. No duties by way of such\r\nprohibition.\" It does not appear that any reference to Negroes was here\r\nintended. In the extant copy, however, notes in Edward Rutledge's\r\nhandwriting change the second clause to \"No prohibition on such\r\ninhabitants or people as the several States think proper to admit.\"[2]\r\nIn the report, August 6, these clauses take the following form:--\r\n\r\n    \"Article VII. Section 4. No tax or duty shall be laid by the\r\n    legislature on articles exported from any state; nor on the\r\n    migration or importation of such persons as the several states\r\n    shall think proper to admit; nor shall such migration or\r\n    importation be prohibited.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. ~The General Debate.~ This, of course, referred both to immigrants\r\n(\"migration\") and to slaves (\"importation\").[4] Debate on this section\r\nbegan Tuesday, August 22, and lasted two days. Luther Martin of Maryland\r\nprecipitated the discussion by a proposition to alter the section so as\r\nto allow a prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves. The debate\r\nimmediately became general, being carried on principally by Rutledge,\r\nthe Pinckneys, and Williamson from the Carolinas; Baldwin of Georgia;\r\nMason, Madison, and Randolph of Virginia; Wilson and Gouverneur Morris\r\nof Pennsylvania; Dickinson of Delaware; and Ellsworth, Sherman, Gerry,\r\nKing, and Langdon of New England.[5]\r\n\r\nIn this debate the moral arguments were prominent. Colonel George Mason\r\nof Virginia denounced the traffic in slaves as \"infernal;\" Luther Martin\r\nof Maryland regarded it as \"inconsistent with the principles of the\r\nrevolution, and dishonorable to the American character.\" \"Every\r\nprinciple of honor and safety,\" declared John Dickinson of Delaware,\r\n\"demands the exclusion of slaves.\" Indeed, Mason solemnly averred that\r\nthe crime of slavery might yet bring the judgment of God on the nation.\r\nOn the other side, Rutledge of South Carolina bluntly declared that\r\nreligion and humanity had nothing to do with the question, that it was a\r\nmatter of \"interest\" alone. Gerry of Massachusetts wished merely to\r\nrefrain from giving direct sanction to the trade, while others contented\r\nthemselves with pointing out the inconsistency of condemning the\r\nslave-trade and defending slavery.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the whole argument, from the moral standpoint, lay in\r\nthe fact that it was completely checkmated by the obstinate attitude of\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia. Their delegates--Baldwin, the Pinckneys,\r\nRutledge, and others--asserted flatly, not less than a half-dozen times\r\nduring the debate, that these States \"can never receive the plan if it\r\nprohibits the slave-trade;\" that \"if the Convention thought\" that these\r\nStates would consent to a stoppage of the slave-trade, \"the expectation\r\nis vain.\"[6] By this stand all argument from the moral standpoint was\r\nvirtually silenced, for the Convention evidently agreed with Roger\r\nSherman of Connecticut that \"it was better to let the Southern States\r\nimport slaves than to part with those States.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a dilemma the Convention listened not unwillingly to the _non\r\npossumus_ arguments of the States' Rights advocates. The \"morality and\r\nwisdom\" of slavery, declared Ellsworth of Connecticut, \"are\r\nconsiderations belonging to the States themselves;\" let every State\r\n\"import what it pleases;\" the Confederation has not \"meddled\" with the\r\nquestion, why should the Union? It is a dangerous symptom of\r\ncentralization, cried Baldwin of Georgia; the \"central States\" wish to\r\nbe the \"vortex for everything,\" even matters of \"a local nature.\" The\r\nnational government, said Gerry of Massachusetts, had nothing to do with\r\nslavery in the States; it had only to refrain from giving direct\r\nsanction to the system. Others opposed this whole argument, declaring,\r\nwith Langdon of New Hampshire, that Congress ought to have this power,\r\nsince, as Dickinson tartly remarked, \"The true question was, whether the\r\nnational happiness would be promoted or impeded by the importation; and\r\nthis question ought to be left to the national government, not to the\r\nstates particularly interested.\"\r\n\r\nBeside these arguments as to the right of the trade and the proper seat\r\nof authority over it, many arguments of general expediency were\r\nintroduced. From an economic standpoint, for instance, General C.C.\r\nPinckney of South Carolina \"contended, that the importation of slaves\r\nwould be for the interest of the whole Union. The more slaves, the more\r\nproduce.\" Rutledge of the same State declared: \"If the Northern States\r\nconsult their interest, they will not oppose the increase of slaves,\r\nwhich will increase the commodities of which they will become the\r\ncarriers.\" This sentiment found a more or less conscious echo in the\r\nwords of Ellsworth of Connecticut, \"What enriches a part enriches the\r\nwhole.\" It was, moreover, broadly hinted that the zeal of Maryland and\r\nVirginia against the trade had an economic rather than a humanitarian\r\nmotive, since they had slaves enough and to spare, and wished to sell\r\nthem at a high price to South Carolina and Georgia, who needed more. In\r\nsuch case restrictions would unjustly discriminate against the latter\r\nStates. The argument from history was barely touched upon. Only once was\r\nthere an allusion to \"the example of all the world\" \"in all ages\" to\r\njustify slavery,[7] and once came the counter declaration that \"Greece\r\nand Rome were made unhappy by their slaves.\"[8] On the other hand, the\r\nmilitary weakness of slavery in the late war led to many arguments on\r\nthat score. Luther Martin and George Mason dwelt on the danger of a\r\nservile class in war and insurrection; while Rutledge hotly replied that\r\nhe \"would readily exempt the other states from the obligation to protect\r\nthe Southern against them;\" and Ellsworth thought that the very danger\r\nwould \"become a motive to kind treatment.\" The desirability of keeping\r\nslavery out of the West was once mentioned as an argument against the\r\ntrade: to this all seemed tacitly to agree.[9]\r\n\r\nThroughout the debate it is manifest that the Convention had no desire\r\nreally to enter upon a general slavery argument. The broader and more\r\ntheoretic aspects of the question were but lightly touched upon here and\r\nthere. Undoubtedly, most of the members would have much preferred not to\r\nraise the question at all; but, as it was raised, the differences of\r\nopinion were too manifest to be ignored, and the Convention, after its\r\nfirst perplexity, gradually and perhaps too willingly set itself to work\r\nto find some \"middle ground\" on which all parties could stand. The way\r\nto this compromise was pointed out by the South. The most radical\r\npro-slavery arguments always ended with the opinion that \"if the\r\nSouthern States were let alone, they will probably of themselves stop\r\nimportations.\"[10] To be sure, General Pinckney admitted that,\r\n\"candidly, he did not think South Carolina would stop her importations\r\nof slaves in any short time;\" nevertheless, the Convention \"observed,\"\r\nwith Roger Sherman, \"that the abolition of slavery seemed to be going on\r\nin the United States, and that the good sense of the several states\r\nwould probably by degrees complete it.\" Economic forces were evoked to\r\neke out moral motives: when the South had its full quota of slaves, like\r\nVirginia it too would abolish the trade; free labor was bound finally to\r\ndrive out slave labor. Thus the chorus of \"_laissez-faire_\" increased;\r\nand compromise seemed at least in sight, when Connecticut cried, \"Let\r\nthe trade alone!\" and Georgia denounced it as an \"evil.\" Some few\r\ndiscordant notes were heard, as, for instance, when Wilson of\r\nPennsylvania made the uncomforting remark, \"If South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia were themselves disposed to get rid of the importation of slaves\r\nin a short time, as had been suggested, they would never refuse to unite\r\nbecause the importation might be prohibited.\"\r\n\r\nWith the spirit of compromise in the air, it was not long before the\r\ngeneral terms were clear. The slavery side was strongly intrenched, and\r\nhad a clear and definite demand. The forces of freedom were, on the\r\ncontrary, divided by important conflicts of interest, and animated by no\r\nvery strong and decided anti-slavery spirit with settled aims. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, it was easy for the Convention to miss the\r\nopportunity for a really great compromise, and to descend to a scheme\r\nthat savored unpleasantly of \"log-rolling.\" The student of the situation\r\nwill always have good cause to believe that a more sturdy and definite\r\nanti-slavery stand at this point might have changed history for the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n34. ~The Special Committee and the \"Bargain.\"~ Since the debate had, in\r\nthe first place, arisen from a proposition to tax the importation of\r\nslaves, the yielding of this point by the South was the first move\r\ntoward compromise. To all but the doctrinaires, who shrank from taxing\r\nmen as property, the argument that the failure to tax slaves was\r\nequivalent to a bounty, was conclusive. With this point settled,\r\nRandolph voiced the general sentiment, when he declared that he \"was for\r\ncommitting, in order that some middle ground might, if possible, be\r\nfound.\" Finally, Gouverneur Morris discovered the \"middle ground,\" in\r\nhis suggestion that the whole subject be committed, \"including the\r\nclauses relating to taxes on exports and to a navigation act. These\r\nthings,\" said he, \"may form a bargain among the Northern and Southern\r\nStates.\" This was quickly assented to; and sections four and five, on\r\nslave-trade and capitation tax, were committed by a vote of 7 to 3,[11]\r\nand section six, on navigation acts, by a vote of 9 to 2.[12] All three\r\nclauses were referred to the following committee: Langdon of New\r\nHampshire, King of Massachusetts, Johnson of Connecticut, Livingston of\r\nNew Jersey, Clymer of Pennsylvania, Dickinson of Delaware, Martin of\r\nMaryland, Madison of Virginia, Williamson of North Carolina, General\r\nPinckney of South Carolina, and Baldwin of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe fullest account of the proceedings of this committee is given in\r\nLuther Martin's letter to his constituents, and is confirmed in its main\r\nparticulars by similar reports of other delegates. Martin writes: \"A\r\ncommittee of _one_ member from each state was chosen by ballot, to take\r\nthis part of the system under their consideration, and to endeavor to\r\nagree upon some report which should reconcile those states [i.e., South\r\nCarolina and Georgia]. To this committee also was referred the following\r\nproposition, which had been reported by the committee of detail, viz.:\r\n'No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of two thirds of\r\nthe members present in each house'--a proposition which the staple and\r\ncommercial states were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce should\r\nbe placed too much under the power of the Eastern States, but which\r\nthese last States were as anxious to reject. This committee--of which\r\nalso I had the honor to be a member--met, and took under their\r\nconsideration the subjects committed to them. I found the _Eastern_\r\nStates, notwithstanding their _aversion to slavery_, were very willing\r\nto indulge the Southern States at least with a temporary liberty to\r\nprosecute the slave trade, provided the Southern States would, in their\r\nturn, gratify _them_, by laying no restriction on navigation acts; and\r\nafter a very little time, the committee, by a great majority, agreed on\r\na report, by which the general government was to be prohibited from\r\npreventing the importation of slaves for a limited time, and the\r\nrestrictive clause relative to navigation acts was to be omitted.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThat the \"bargain\" was soon made is proven by the fact that the\r\ncommittee reported the very next day, Friday, August 24, and that on\r\nSaturday the report was taken up. It was as follows: \"Strike out so much\r\nof the fourth section as was referred to the committee, and insert 'The\r\nmigration or importation of such persons as the several states, now\r\nexisting, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the\r\nlegislature prior to the year 1800; but a tax or duty may be imposed on\r\nsuch migration or importation, at a rate not exceeding the average of\r\nthe duties laid on imports.' The fifth section to remain as in the\r\nreport. The sixth section to be stricken out.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n35. ~The Appeal to the Convention.~ The ensuing debate,[15] which lasted\r\nonly a part of the day, was evidently a sort of appeal to the House on\r\nthe decisions of the committee. It throws light on the points of\r\ndisagreement. General Pinckney first proposed to extend the\r\nslave-trading limit to 1808, and Gorham of Massachusetts seconded the\r\nmotion. This brought a spirited protest from Madison: \"Twenty years will\r\nproduce all the mischief that can be apprehended from the liberty to\r\nimport slaves. So long a term will be more dishonorable to the American\r\ncharacter than to say nothing about it in the Constitution.\"[16] There\r\nwas, however, evidently another \"bargain\" here; for, without farther\r\ndebate, the South and the East voted the extension, 7 to 4, only New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia objecting. The ambiguous\r\nphraseology of the whole slave-trade section as reported did not pass\r\nwithout comment; Gouverneur Morris would have it read: \"The importation\r\nof slaves into North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, shall not be\r\nprohibited,\" etc.[17] This emendation was, however, too painfully\r\ntruthful for the doctrinaires, and was, amid a score of objections,\r\nwithdrawn. The taxation clause also was manifestly too vague for\r\npractical use, and Baldwin of Georgia wished to amend it by inserting\r\n\"common impost on articles not enumerated,\" in lieu of the \"average\"\r\nduty.[18] This minor point gave rise to considerable argument: Sherman\r\nand Madison deprecated any such recognition of property in man as taxing\r\nwould imply; Mason and Gorham argued that the tax restrained the trade;\r\nwhile King, Langdon, and General Pinckney contented themselves with the\r\nremark that this clause was \"the price of the first part.\" Finally, it\r\nwas unanimously agreed to make the duty \"not exceeding ten dollars for\r\neach person.\"[19]\r\n\r\nSouthern interests now being safe, some Southern members attempted, a\r\nfew days later, to annul the \"bargain\" by restoring the requirement of a\r\ntwo-thirds vote in navigation acts. Charles Pinckney made the motion, in\r\nan elaborate speech designed to show the conflicting commercial\r\ninterests of the States; he declared that \"The power of regulating\r\ncommerce was a pure concession on the part of the Southern States.\"[20]\r\nMartin and Williamson of North Carolina, Butler of South Carolina, and\r\nMason of Virginia defended the proposition, insisting that it would be a\r\ndangerous concession on the part of the South to leave navigation acts\r\nto a mere majority vote. Sherman of Connecticut, Morris of Pennsylvania,\r\nand Spaight of North Carolina declared that the very diversity of\r\ninterest was a security. Finally, by a vote of 7 to 4, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, and Georgia being in the minority, the\r\nConvention refused to consider the motion, and the recommendation of the\r\ncommittee passed.[21]\r\n\r\nWhen, on September 10, the Convention was discussing the amendment\r\nclause of the Constitution, the ever-alert Rutledge, perceiving that\r\nthe results of the laboriously settled \"bargain\" might be endangered,\r\ndeclared that he \"never could agree to give a power by which the\r\narticles relating to slaves might be altered by the states not\r\ninterested in that property.\"[22] As a result, the clause finally\r\nadopted, September 15, had the proviso: \"Provided, that no amendment\r\nwhich may be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the\r\n1st and 4th clauses in the 9th section of the 1st article.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n36. ~Settlement by the Convention.~ Thus, the slave-trade article of the\r\nConstitution stood finally as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Article I. Section 9. The Migration or Importation of such\r\n    Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to\r\n    admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year\r\n    one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be\r\n    imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each\r\n    Person.\"\r\n\r\nThis settlement of the slavery question brought out distinct differences\r\nof moral attitude toward the institution, and yet differences far from\r\nhopeless. To be sure, the South apologized for slavery, the Middle\r\nStates denounced it, and the East could only tolerate it from afar; and\r\nyet all three sections united in considering it a temporary institution,\r\nthe corner-stone of which was the slave-trade. No one of them had ever\r\nseen a system of slavery without an active slave-trade; and there were\r\nprobably few members of the Convention who did not believe that the\r\nfoundations of slavery had been sapped merely by putting the abolition\r\nof the slave-trade in the hands of Congress twenty years hence. Here lay\r\nthe danger; for when the North called slavery \"temporary,\" she thought\r\nof twenty or thirty years, while the \"temporary\" period of the South was\r\nscarcely less than a century. Meantime, for at least a score of years, a\r\npolicy of strict _laissez-faire_, so far as the general government was\r\nconcerned, was to intervene. Instead of calling the whole moral energy\r\nof the people into action, so as gradually to crush this portentous\r\nevil, the Federal Convention lulled the nation to sleep by a \"bargain,\"\r\nand left to the vacillating and unripe judgment of the States one of the\r\nmost threatening of the social and political ills which they were so\r\ncourageously seeking to remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n37. ~Reception of the Clause by the Nation.~ When the proposed\r\nConstitution was before the country, the slave-trade article came in for\r\nno small amount of condemnation and apology. In the pamphlets of the day\r\nit was much discussed. One of the points in Mason's \"Letter of\r\nObjections\" was that \"the general legislature is restrained from\r\nprohibiting the further importation of slaves for twenty odd years,\r\nthough such importations render the United States weaker, more\r\nvulnerable, and less capable of defence.\"[24] To this Iredell replied,\r\nthrough the columns of the _State Gazette_ of North Carolina: \"If all\r\nthe States had been willing to adopt this regulation [i.e., to prohibit\r\nthe slave-trade], I should as an individual most heartily have approved\r\nof it, because even if the importation of slaves in fact rendered us\r\nstronger, less vulnerable and more capable of defence, I should rejoice\r\nin the prohibition of it, as putting an end to a trade which has already\r\ncontinued too long for the honor and humanity of those concerned in it.\r\nBut as it was well known that South Carolina and Georgia thought a\r\nfurther continuance of such importations useful to them, and would not\r\nperhaps otherwise have agreed to the new constitution, those States\r\nwhich had been importing till they were satisfied, could not with\r\ndecency have insisted upon their relinquishing advantages themselves had\r\nalready enjoyed. Our situation makes it necessary to bear the evil as it\r\nis. It will be left to the future legislatures to allow such\r\nimportations or not. If any, in violation of their clear conviction of\r\nthe injustice of this trade, persist in pursuing it, this is a matter\r\nbetween God and their own consciences. The interests of humanity will,\r\nhowever, have gained something by the prohibition of this inhuman trade,\r\nthough at a distance of twenty odd years.\"[25]\r\n\r\n\"Centinel,\" representing the Quaker sentiment of Pennsylvania, attacked\r\nthe clause in his third letter, published in the _Independent Gazetteer,\r\nor The Chronicle of Freedom_, November 8, 1787: \"We are told that the\r\nobjects of this article are slaves, and that it is inserted to secure to\r\nthe southern states the right of introducing negroes for twenty-one\r\nyears to come, against the declared sense of the other states to put an\r\nend to an odious traffic in the human species, which is especially\r\nscandalous and inconsistent in a people, who have asserted their own\r\nliberty by the sword, and which dangerously enfeebles the districts\r\nwherein the laborers are bondsmen. The words, dark and ambiguous, such\r\nas no plain man of common sense would have used, are evidently chosen to\r\nconceal from Europe, that in this enlightened country, the practice of\r\nslavery has its advocates among men in the highest stations. When it is\r\nrecollected that no poll tax can be imposed on _five_ negroes, above\r\nwhat _three_ whites shall be charged; when it is considered, that the\r\nimposts on the consumption of Carolina field negroes must be trifling,\r\nand the excise nothing, it is plain that the proportion of\r\ncontributions, which can be expected from the southern states under the\r\nnew constitution, will be unequal, and yet they are to be allowed to\r\nenfeeble themselves by the further importation of negroes till the year\r\n1808. Has not the concurrence of the five southern states (in the\r\nconvention) to the new system, been purchased too dearly by the\r\nrest?\"[26]\r\n\r\nNoah Webster's \"Examination\" (1787) addressed itself to such Quaker\r\nscruples: \"But, say the enemies of slavery, negroes may be imported for\r\ntwenty-one years. This exception is addressed to the quakers, and a very\r\npitiful exception it is. The truth is, Congress cannot prohibit the\r\nimportation of slaves during that period; but the laws against the\r\nimportation into particular states, stand unrepealed. An immediate\r\nabolition of slavery would bring ruin upon the whites, and misery upon\r\nthe blacks, in the southern states. The constitution has therefore\r\nwisely left each state to pursue its own measures, with respect to this\r\narticle of legislation, during the period of twenty-one years.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThe following year the \"Examination\" of Tench Coxe said: \"The temporary\r\nreservation of any particular matter must ever be deemed an admission\r\nthat it should be done away. This appears to have been well understood.\r\nIn addition to the arguments drawn from liberty, justice and religion,\r\nopinions against this practice [i.e., of slave-trading], founded in\r\nsound policy, have no doubt been urged. Regard was necessarily paid to\r\nthe peculiar situation of our southern fellow-citizens; but they, on the\r\nother hand, have not been insensible of the delicate situation of our\r\nnational character on this subject.\"[28]\r\n\r\nFrom quite different motives Southern men defended this section. For\r\ninstance, Dr. David Ramsay, a South Carolina member of the Convention,\r\nwrote in his \"Address\": \"It is farther objected, that they have\r\nstipulated for a right to prohibit the importation of negroes after 21\r\nyears. On this subject observe, as they are bound to protect us from\r\ndomestic violence, they think we ought not to increase our exposure to\r\nthat evil, by an unlimited importation of slaves. Though Congress may\r\nforbid the importation of negroes after 21 years, it does not follow\r\nthat they will. On the other hand, it is probable that they will not.\r\nThe more rice we make, the more business will be for their shipping;\r\ntheir interest will therefore coincide with ours. Besides, we have other\r\nsources of supply--the importation of the ensuing 20 years, added to the\r\nnatural increase of those we already have, and the influx from our\r\nnorthern neighbours who are desirous of getting rid of their slaves,\r\nwill afford a sufficient number for cultivating all the lands in this\r\nstate.\"[29]\r\n\r\nFinally, _The Federalist_, No. 41, written by James Madison, commented\r\nas follows: \"It were doubtless to be wished, that the power of\r\nprohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the\r\nyear 1808, or rather, that it had been suffered to have immediate\r\noperation. But it is not difficult to account, either for this\r\nrestriction on the General Government, or for the manner in which the\r\nwhole clause is expressed. It ought to be considered as a great point\r\ngained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate\r\nforever, within these States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly\r\nupbraided the barbarism of modern policy; that within that period, it\r\nwill receive a considerable discouragement from the Federal Government,\r\nand may be totally abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which\r\ncontinue the unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has\r\nbeen given by so great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for\r\nthe unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them of being\r\nredeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren!\r\n\r\n\"Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection\r\nagainst the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a criminal\r\ntoleration of an illicit practice, and on another, as calculated to\r\nprevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from Europe to America. I\r\nmention these misconstructions, not with a view to give them an answer,\r\nfor they deserve none; but as specimens of the manner and spirit, in\r\nwhich some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed\r\nGovernment.\"[30]\r\n\r\n\r\n38. ~Attitude of the State Conventions.~ The records of the proceedings\r\nin the various State conventions are exceedingly meagre. In nearly all\r\nof the few States where records exist there is found some opposition to\r\nthe slave-trade clause. The opposition was seldom very pronounced or\r\nbitter; it rather took the form of regret, on the one hand that the\r\nConvention went so far, and on the other hand that it did not go\r\nfarther. Probably, however, the Constitution was never in danger of\r\nrejection on account of this clause.\r\n\r\nExtracts from a few of the speeches, _pro_ and _con_, in various States\r\nwill best illustrate the character of the arguments. In reply to some\r\nobjections expressed in the Pennsylvania convention, Wilson said,\r\nDecember 3, 1787: \"I consider this as laying the foundation for\r\nbanishing slavery out of this country; and though the period is more\r\ndistant than I could wish, yet it will produce the same kind, gradual\r\nchange, which was pursued in Pennsylvania.\"[31] Robert Barnwell declared\r\nin the South Carolina convention, January 17, 1788, that this clause\r\n\"particularly pleased\" him. \"Congress,\" he said, \"has guarantied this\r\nright for that space of time, and at its expiration may continue it as\r\nlong as they please. This question then arises--What will their interest\r\nlead them to do? The Eastern States, as the honorable gentleman says,\r\nwill become the carriers of America. It will, therefore, certainly be\r\ntheir interest to encourage exportation to as great an extent as\r\npossible; and if the quantum of our products will be diminished by the\r\nprohibition of negroes, I appeal to the belief of every man, whether he\r\nthinks those very carriers will themselves dam up the sources from\r\nwhence their profit is derived. To think so is so contradictory to the\r\ngeneral conduct of mankind, that I am of opinion, that, without we\r\nourselves put a stop to them, the traffic for negroes will continue\r\nforever.\"[32]\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, January 30, 1788, General Heath said: \"The gentlemen\r\nwho have spoken have carried the matter rather too far on both sides. I\r\napprehend that it is not in our power to do anything for or against\r\nthose who are in slavery in the southern States.... Two questions\r\nnaturally arise, if we ratify the Constitution: Shall we do anything by\r\nour act to hold the blacks in slavery? or shall we become partakers of\r\nother men's sins? I think neither of them. Each State is sovereign and\r\nindependent to a certain degree, and they have a right, and will\r\nregulate their own internal affairs, as to themselves appears\r\nproper.\"[33] Iredell said, in the North Carolina convention, July 26,\r\n1788: \"When the entire abolition of slavery takes place, it will be an\r\nevent which must be pleasing to every generous mind, and every friend of\r\nhuman nature.... But as it is, this government is nobly distinguished\r\nabove others by that very provision.\"[34]\r\n\r\nOf the arguments against the clause, two made in the Massachusetts\r\nconvention are typical. The Rev. Mr. Neal said, January 25, 1788, that\r\n\"unless his objection [to this clause] was removed, he could not put his\r\nhand to the Constitution.\"[35] General Thompson exclaimed, \"Shall it be\r\nsaid, that after we have established our own independence and freedom,\r\nwe make slaves of others?\"[36] Mason, in the Virginia convention, June\r\n15, 1788, said: \"As much as I value a union of all the states, I would\r\nnot admit the Southern States into the Union unless they agree to the\r\ndiscontinuance of this disgraceful trade.... Yet they have not secured\r\nus the property of the slaves we have already. So that 'they have done\r\nwhat they ought not to have done, and have left undone what they ought\r\nto have done.'\"[37] Joshua Atherton, who led the opposition in the New\r\nHampshire convention, said: \"The idea that strikes those who are opposed\r\nto this clause so disagreeably and so forcibly is,--hereby it is\r\nconceived (if we ratify the Constitution) that we become _consenters to_\r\nand _partakers in_ the sin and guilt of this abominable traffic, at\r\nleast for a certain period, without any positive stipulation that it\r\nshall even then be brought to an end.\"[38]\r\n\r\nIn the South Carolina convention Lowndes, January 16, 1788, attacked the\r\nslave-trade clause. \"Negroes,\" said he, \"were our wealth, our only\r\nnatural resource; yet behold how our kind friends in the north were\r\ndetermined soon to tie up our hands, and drain us of what we had! The\r\nEastern States drew their means of subsistence, in a great measure, from\r\ntheir shipping; and, on that head, they had been particularly careful\r\nnot to allow of any burdens.... Why, then, call this a reciprocal\r\nbargain, which took all from one party, to bestow it on the other!\"[39]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this discussion in the different States, only one State,\r\nRhode Island, went so far as to propose an amendment directing Congress\r\nto \"promote and establish such laws and regulations as may effectually\r\nprevent the importation of slaves of every description, into the United\r\nStates.\"[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. ~Acceptance of the Policy.~ As in the Federal Convention, so in the\r\nState conventions, it is noticeable that the compromise was accepted by\r\nthe various States from widely different motives.[41] Nevertheless,\r\nthese motives were not fixed and unchangeable, and there was still\r\ndiscernible a certain underlying agreement in the dislike of slavery.\r\nOne cannot help thinking that if the devastation of the late war had not\r\nleft an extraordinary demand for slaves in the South,--if, for instance,\r\nthere had been in 1787 the same plethora in the slave-market as in\r\n1774,--the future history of the country would have been far different.\r\nAs it was, the twenty-one years of _laissez-faire_ were confirmed by the\r\nStates, and the nation entered upon the constitutional period with the\r\nslave-trade legal in three States,[42] and with a feeling of quiescence\r\ntoward it in the rest of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Conway, _Life and Papers of Edmund Randolph_, ch. ix.\r\n\r\n  [2] Conway, _Life and Papers of Edmund Randolph_, p. 78.\r\n\r\n  [3] Elliot, _Debates_, I. 227.\r\n\r\n  [4] Cf.

In\r\n      the Pennsylvania convention there was considerable debate,\r\n      partially preserved in Elliot's and Lloyd's _Debates_. In the\r\n      Massachusetts convention the debate on this clause occupied a\r\n      part of two or three days, reported in published debates.

Key-Note of the Period.\r\n\r\n\r\n40. ~Influence of the Haytian Revolution.~ The rôle which the great\r\nNegro Toussaint, called L'Ouverture, played in the history of the United\r\nStates has seldom been fully appreciated. Representing the age of\r\nrevolution in America, he rose to leadership through a bloody terror,\r\nwhich contrived a Negro \"problem\" for the Western Hemisphere,\r\nintensified and defined the anti-slavery movement, became one of the\r\ncauses, and probably the prime one, which led Napoleon to sell Louisiana\r\nfor a song, and finally, through the interworking of all these effects,\r\nrendered more certain the final prohibition of the slave-trade by the\r\nUnited States in 1807.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the reorganization of the Pennsylvania Abolition\r\nSociety, in 1787, anti-slavery sentiment became active. New York, New\r\nJersey, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia had strong\r\norganizations, and a national convention was held in 1794. The terrible\r\nupheaval in the West Indies, beginning in 1791, furnished this rising\r\nmovement with an irresistible argument. A wave of horror and fear swept\r\nover the South, which even the powerful slave-traders of Georgia did not\r\ndare withstand; the Middle States saw their worst dreams realized, and\r\nthe mercenary trade interests of the East lost control of the New\r\nEngland conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n41. ~Legislation of the Southern States.~ In a few years the growing\r\nsentiment had crystallized into legislation. The Southern States took\r\nimmediate measures to close their ports, first against West India\r\nNegroes, finally against all slaves. Georgia, who had had legal slavery\r\nonly from 1755, and had since passed no restrictive legislation, felt\r\ncompelled in 1793[1] to stop the entry of free Negroes, and in 1798[2]\r\nto prohibit, under heavy penalties, the importation of all slaves. This\r\nprovision was placed in the Constitution of the State, and, although\r\nmiserably enforced, was never repealed.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was the first Southern State in which the exigencies of a\r\ngreat staple crop rendered the rapid consumption of slaves more\r\nprofitable than their proper maintenance. Alternating, therefore,\r\nbetween a plethora and a dearth of Negroes, she prohibited the\r\nslave-trade only for short periods. In 1788[3] she had forbidden the\r\ntrade for five years, and in 1792,[4] being peculiarly exposed to the\r\nWest Indian insurrection, she quickly found it \"inexpedient\" to allow\r\nNegroes \"from Africa, the West India Islands, or other place beyond sea\"\r\nto enter for two years. This act continued to be extended, although with\r\nlessening penalties, until 1803.[5] The home demand in view of the\r\nprobable stoppage of the trade in 1808, the speculative chances of the\r\nnew Louisiana Territory trade, and the large already existing illicit\r\ntraffic combined in that year to cause the passage of an act, December\r\n17, reopening the African slave-trade, although still carefully\r\nexcluding \"West India\" Negroes.[6] This action profoundly stirred the\r\nUnion, aroused anti-slavery sentiment, led to a concerted movement for a\r\nconstitutional amendment, and, failing in this, to an irresistible\r\ndemand for a national prohibitory act at the earliest constitutional\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina had repealed her prohibitory duty act in 1790,[7] but in\r\n1794 she passed an \"Act to prevent further importation and bringing of\r\nslaves,\" etc.[8] Even the body-servants of West India immigrants and,\r\nnaturally, all free Negroes, were eventually prohibited.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n42. ~Legislation of the Border States.~ The Border States, Virginia and\r\nMaryland, strengthened their non-importation laws, Virginia freeing\r\nillegally imported Negroes,[10] and Maryland prohibiting even the\r\ninterstate trade.[11] The Middle States took action chiefly in the final\r\nabolition of slavery within their borders, and the prevention of the\r\nfitting out of slaving vessels in their ports. Delaware declared, in her\r\nAct of 1789, that \"it is inconsistent with that spirit of general\r\nliberty which pervades the constitution of this state, that vessels\r\nshould be fitted out, or equipped, in any of the ports thereof, for the\r\npurpose of receiving and transporting the natives of Africa to places\r\nwhere they are held in slavery,\"[12] and forbade such a practice under\r\npenalty of £500 for each person so engaged. The Pennsylvania Act of\r\n1788[13] had similar provisions, with a penalty of £1000; and New Jersey\r\nfollowed with an act in 1798.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n43. ~Legislation of the Eastern States.~ In the Eastern States, where\r\nslavery as an institution was already nearly defunct, action was aimed\r\ntoward stopping the notorious participation of citizens in the\r\nslave-trade outside the State. The prime movers were the Rhode Island\r\nQuakers. Having early secured a law against the traffic in their own\r\nState, they turned their attention to others. Through their\r\nremonstrances Connecticut, in 1788,[15] prohibited participation in the\r\ntrade by a fine of £500 on the vessel, £50 on each slave, and loss of\r\ninsurance; this act was strengthened in 1792,[16] the year after the\r\nHaytian revolt. Massachusetts, after many fruitless attempts, finally\r\ntook advantage of an unusually bold case of kidnapping, and passed a\r\nsimilar act in 1788.[17] \"This,\" says Belknap, \"was the utmost which\r\ncould be done by our legislatures; we still have to regret the\r\nimpossibility of making a law _here_, which shall restrain our citizens\r\nfrom carrying on this trade _in foreign bottoms_, and from committing\r\nthe crimes which this act prohibits, _in foreign countries_, as it is\r\nsaid some of them have done since the enacting of these laws.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThus it is seen how, spurred by the tragedy in the West Indies, the\r\nUnited States succeeded by State action in prohibiting the slave-trade\r\nfrom 1798 to 1803, in furthering the cause of abolition, and in\r\npreventing the fitting out of slave-trade expeditions in United States\r\nports. The country had good cause to congratulate itself. The national\r\ngovernment hastened to supplement State action as far as possible, and\r\nthe prophecies of the more sanguine Revolutionary fathers seemed about\r\nto be realized, when the ill-considered act of South Carolina showed the\r\nweakness of the constitutional compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n44. ~First Debate in Congress, 1789.~ The attention of the national\r\ngovernment was early directed to slavery and the trade by the rise, in\r\nthe first Congress, of the question of taxing slaves imported. During\r\nthe debate on the duty bill introduced by Clymer's committee, Parker of\r\nVirginia moved, May 13, 1789, to lay a tax of ten dollars _per capita_\r\non slaves imported. He plainly stated that the tax was designed to check\r\nthe trade, and that he was \"sorry that the Constitution prevented\r\nCongress from prohibiting the importation altogether.\" The proposal was\r\nevidently unwelcome, and caused an extended debate.[19] Smith of South\r\nCarolina wanted to postpone a matter so \"big with the most serious\r\nconsequences to the State he represented.\" Roger Sherman of Connecticut\r\n\"could not reconcile himself to the insertion of human beings as an\r\narticle of duty, among goods, wares, and merchandise.\" Jackson of\r\nGeorgia argued against any restriction, and thought such States as\r\nVirginia \"ought to let their neighbors get supplied, before they imposed\r\nsuch a burden upon the importation.\" Tucker of South Carolina declared\r\nit \"unfair to bring in such an important subject at a time when debate\r\nwas almost precluded,\" and denied the right of Congress to \"consider\r\nwhether the importation of slaves is proper or not.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Parker was evidently somewhat abashed by this onslaught of friend\r\nand foe, but he \"had ventured to introduce the subject after full\r\ndeliberation, and did not like to withdraw it.\" He desired Congress, \"if\r\npossible,\" to \"wipe off the stigma under which America labored.\" This\r\nbrought Jackson of Georgia again to his feet. He believed, in spite of\r\nthe \"fashion of the day,\" that the Negroes were better off as slaves\r\nthan as freedmen, and that, as the tax was partial, \"it would be the\r\nmost odious tax Congress could impose.\" Such sentiments were a distinct\r\nadvance in pro-slavery doctrine, and called for a protest from Madison\r\nof Virginia. He thought the discussion proper, denied the partiality of\r\nthe tax, and declared that, according to the spirit of the Constitution\r\nand his own desire, it was to be hoped \"that, by expressing a national\r\ndisapprobation of this trade, we may destroy it, and save ourselves from\r\nreproaches, and our posterity the imbecility ever attendant on a country\r\nfilled with slaves.\" Finally, to Burke of South Carolina, who thought\r\n\"the gentlemen were contending for nothing,\" Madison sharply rejoined,\r\n\"If we contend for nothing, the gentlemen who are opposed to us do not\r\ncontend for a great deal.\"\r\n\r\nIt now became clear that Congress had been whirled into a discussion of\r\ntoo delicate and lengthy a nature to allow its further prolongation.\r\nCompromising councils prevailed; and it was agreed that the present\r\nproposition should be withdrawn and a separate bill brought in. This\r\nbill was, however, at the next session dexterously postponed \"until the\r\nnext session of Congress.\"[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n45. ~Second Debate in Congress, 1790.~ It is doubtful if Congress of its\r\nown initiative would soon have resurrected the matter, had not a new\r\nanti-slavery weapon appeared in the shape of urgent petitions from\r\nabolition societies. The first petition, presented February 11,\r\n1790,[21] was from the same interstate Yearly Meeting of Friends which\r\nhad formerly petitioned the Confederation Congress.[22] They urged\r\nCongress to inquire \"whether, notwithstanding such seeming impediments,\r\nit be not in reality within your power to exercise justice and mercy,\r\nwhich, if adhered to, we cannot doubt, must produce the abolition of the\r\nslave trade,\" etc. Another Quaker petition from New York was also\r\npresented,[23] and both were about to be referred, when Smith of South\r\nCarolina objected, and precipitated a sharp debate.[24] This debate had\r\na distinctly different tone from that of the preceding one, and\r\nrepresents another step in pro-slavery doctrine. The key-note of these\r\nutterances was struck by Stone of Maryland, who \"feared that if Congress\r\ntook any measures indicative of an intention to interfere with the kind\r\nof property alluded to, it would sink it in value very considerably, and\r\nmight be injurious to a great number of the citizens, particularly in\r\nthe Southern States. He thought the subject was of general concern, and\r\nthat the petitioners had no more right to interfere with it than any\r\nother members of the community. It was an unfortunate circumstance, that\r\nit was the disposition of religious sects to imagine they understood the\r\nrights of human nature better than all the world besides.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain did men like Madison disclaim all thought of unconstitutional\r\n\"interference,\" and express only a desire to see \"If anything is within\r\nthe Federal authority to restrain such violation of the rights of\r\nnations and of mankind, as is supposed to be practised in some parts of\r\nthe United States.\" A storm of disapproval from Southern members met\r\nsuch sentiments. \"The rights of the Southern States ought not to be\r\nthreatened,\" said Burke of South Carolina. \"Any extraordinary attention\r\nof Congress to this petition,\" averred Jackson of Georgia, would put\r\nslave property \"in jeopardy,\" and \"evince to the people a disposition\r\ntowards a total emancipation.\" Smith and Tucker of South Carolina\r\ndeclared that the request asked for \"unconstitutional\" measures. Gerry\r\nof Massachusetts, Hartley of Pennsylvania, and Lawrence of New York\r\nrather mildly defended the petitioners; but after considerable further\r\ndebate the matter was laid on the table.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, however, the laid ghost walked again in the shape of\r\nanother petition from the \"Pennsylvania Society for promoting the\r\nAbolition of Slavery,\" signed by its venerable president, Benjamin\r\nFranklin. This petition asked Congress to \"step to the very verge of the\r\npower vested in you for discouraging every species of traffic in the\r\npersons of our fellow-men.\"[25] Hartley of Pennsylvania called up the\r\nmemorial of the preceding day, and it was read a second time and a\r\nmotion for commitment made. Plain words now came from Tucker of South\r\nCarolina. \"The petition,\" he said, \"contained an unconstitutional\r\nrequest.\" The commitment would alarm the South. These petitions were\r\n\"mischievous\" attempts to imbue the slaves with false hopes. The South\r\nwould not submit to a general emancipation without \"civil war.\" The\r\ncommitment would \"blow the trumpet of sedition in the Southern States,\"\r\nechoed his colleague, Burke. The Pennsylvania men spoke just as boldly.\r\nScott declared the petition constitutional, and was sorry that the\r\nConstitution did not interdict this \"most abominable\" traffic. \"Perhaps,\r\nin our Legislative capacity,\" he said, \"we can go no further than to\r\nimpose a duty of ten dollars, but I do not know how far I might go if I\r\nwas one of the Judges of the United States, and those people were to\r\ncome before me and claim their emancipation; but I am sure I would go as\r\nfar as I could.\" Jackson of Georgia rejoined in true Southern spirit,\r\nboldly defending slavery in the light of religion and history, and\r\nasking if it was \"good policy to bring forward a business at this moment\r\nlikely to light up the flame of civil discord; for the people of the\r\nSouthern States will resist one tyranny as soon as another. The other\r\nparts of the Continent may bear them down by force of arms, but they\r\nwill never suffer themselves to be divested of their property without a\r\nstruggle. The gentleman says, if he was a Federal Judge, he does not\r\nknow to what length he would go in emancipating these people; but I\r\nbelieve his judgment would be of short duration in Georgia, perhaps even\r\nthe existence of such a Judge might be in danger.\" Baldwin, his\r\nNew-England-born colleague, urged moderation by reciting the difficulty\r\nwith which the constitutional compromise was reached, and declaring,\r\n\"the moment we go to jostle on that ground, I fear we shall feel it\r\ntremble under our feet.\" Lawrence of New York wanted to commit the\r\nmemorials, in order to see how far Congress might constitutionally\r\ninterfere. Smith of South Carolina, in a long speech, said that his\r\nconstituents entered the Union \"from political, not from moral motives,\"\r\nand that \"we look upon this measure as an attack upon the palladium of\r\nthe property of our country.\" Page of Virginia, although a slave owner,\r\nurged commitment, and Madison again maintained the appropriateness of\r\nthe request, and suggested that \"regulations might be made in relation\r\nto the introduction of them [i.e., slaves] into the new States to be\r\nformed out of the Western Territory.\" Even conservative Gerry of\r\nMassachusetts declared, with regard to the whole trade, that the fact\r\nthat \"we have a right to regulate this business, is as clear as that we\r\nhave any rights whatever.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, by a vote of 43 to 11, the memorials were committed, the South\r\nCarolina and Georgia delegations, Bland and Coles of Virginia, Stone of\r\nMaryland, and Sylvester of New York voting in the negative.[26] A\r\ncommittee, consisting of Foster of New Hampshire, Huntington of\r\nConnecticut, Gerry of Massachusetts, Lawrence of New York, Sinnickson of\r\nNew Jersey, Hartley of Pennsylvania, and Parker of Virginia, was charged\r\nwith the matter, and reported Friday, March 5. The absence of Southern\r\nmembers on this committee compelled it to make this report a sort of\r\nofficial manifesto on the aims of Northern anti-slavery politics. As\r\nsuch, it was sure to meet with vehement opposition in the House, even\r\nthough conservatively worded. Such proved to be the fact when the\r\ncommittee reported. The onslaught to \"negative the whole report\" was\r\nprolonged and bitter, the debate _pro_ and _con_ lasting several\r\ndays.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n46. ~The Declaration of Powers, 1790.~ The result is best seen by\r\ncomparing the original report with the report of the Committee of the\r\nWhole, adopted by a vote of 29 to 25 Monday, March 23, 1790:[28]--\r\n\r\n      REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n      That, from the nature of the matters contained in these\r\n      memorials, they were induced to examine the powers vested in\r\n      Congress, under the present Constitution, relating to the\r\n      Abolition of Slavery, and are clearly of opinion,\r\n\r\n      _First._ That the General Government is expressly restrained\r\n      from prohibiting the importation of such persons 'as any of\r\n      the States now existing shall think proper to admit, until the\r\n      year one thousand eight hundred and eight.'\r\n\r\n      _Secondly._ That Congress, by a fair construction of the\r\n      Constitution, are equally restrained from interfering in the\r\n      emancipation of slaves, who already are, or who may, within\r\n      the period mentioned, be imported into, or born within, any of\r\n      the said States.\r\n\r\n      _Thirdly._ That Congress have no authority to interfere in the\r\n      internal regulations of particular States, relative to the\r\n      instructions of slaves in the principles of morality and\r\n      religion; to their comfortable clothing, accommodations, and\r\n      subsistence; to the regulation of their marriages, and the\r\n      prevention of the violation of the rights thereof, or to the\r\n      separation of children from their parents; to a comfortable\r\n      provision in cases of sickness, age, or infirmity; or to the\r\n      seizure, transportation, or sale of free negroes; but have the\r\n      fullest confidence in the wisdom and humanity of the\r\n      Legislatures of the several States, that they will revise\r\n      their laws from time to time, when necessary, and promote the\r\n      objects mentioned in the memorials, and every other measure\r\n      that may tend to the happiness of slaves.\r\n\r\n      _Fourthly._ That, nevertheless, Congress have authority, if\r\n      they shall think it necessary, to lay at any time a tax or\r\n      duty, not exceeding ten dollars for each person of any\r\n      description, the importation of whom shall be by any of the\r\n      States admitted as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n      _Fifthly._ That Congress have authority to interdict,[29] or\r\n      (so far as it is or may be carried on by citizens of the\r\n      United States, for supplying foreigners), to regulate the\r\n      African trade, and to make provision for the humane treatment\r\n      of slaves, in all cases while on their passage to the United\r\n      States, or to foreign ports, so far as respects the citizens\r\n      of the United States.\r\n\r\n      _Sixthly._ That Congress have also authority to prohibit\r\n      foreigners from fitting out vessels in any port of the United\r\n      States, for transporting persons from Africa to any foreign\r\n      port.\r\n\r\n      _Seventhly._ That the memorialists be informed, that in all\r\n      cases to which the authority of Congress extends, they will\r\n      exercise it for the humane objects of the memorialists, so far\r\n      as they can be promoted on the principles of justice,\r\n      humanity, and good policy.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.\r\n\r\n      _First._ That the migration or importation of such persons as\r\n      any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit,\r\n      cannot be prohibited by Congress, prior to the year one\r\n      thousand eight hundred and eight.\r\n\r\n      _Secondly._ That Congress have no authority to interfere in\r\n      the emancipation of slaves, or in the treatment of them within\r\n      any of the States; it remaining with the several States alone\r\n      to provide any regulation therein, which humanity and true\r\n      policy may require.\r\n\r\n      _Thirdly._ That Congress have authority to restrain the\r\n      citizens of the United States from carrying on the African\r\n      trade, for the purpose of supplying foreigners with slaves,\r\n      and of providing, by proper regulations, for the humane\r\n      treatment, during their passage, of slaves imported by the\r\n      said citizens into the States admitting such importation.\r\n\r\n      _Fourthly._ That Congress have authority to prohibit\r\n      foreigners from fitting out vessels in any port of the United\r\n      States for transporting persons from Africa to any foreign\r\n      port.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. ~The Act of 1794.~ This declaration of the powers of the central\r\ngovernment over the slave-trade bore early fruit in the second Congress,\r\nin the shape of a shower of petitions from abolition societies in\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and Virginia.[30] In some of these slavery was denounced as\r\n\"an outrageous violation of one of the most essential rights of human\r\nnature,\"[31] and the slave-trade as a traffic \"degrading to the rights\r\nof man\" and \"repugnant to reason.\"[32] Others declared the trade\r\n\"injurious to the true commercial interest of a nation,\"[33] and asked\r\nCongress that, having taken up the matter, they do all in their power to\r\nlimit the trade. Congress was, however, determined to avoid as long as\r\npossible so unpleasant a matter, and, save an angry attempt to censure a\r\nQuaker petitioner,[34] nothing was heard of the slave-trade until the\r\nthird Congress.\r\n\r\nMeantime, news came from the seas southeast of Carolina and Georgia\r\nwhich influenced Congress more powerfully than humanitarian arguments\r\nhad done. The wild revolt of despised slaves, the rise of a noble black\r\nleader, and the birth of a new nation of Negro freemen frightened the\r\npro-slavery advocates and armed the anti-slavery agitation. As a result,\r\na Quaker petition for a law against the transport traffic in slaves was\r\nreceived without a murmur in 1794,[35] and on March 22 the first\r\nnational act against the slave-trade became a law.[36] It was designed\r\n\"to prohibit the carrying on the Slave Trade from the United States to\r\nany foreign place or country,\" or the fitting out of slavers in the\r\nUnited States for that country. The penalties for violation were\r\nforfeiture of the ship, a fine of $1000 for each person engaged, and of\r\n$200 for each slave transported. If the Quakers thought this a triumph\r\nof anti-slavery sentiment, they were quickly undeceived. Congress might\r\nwillingly restrain the country from feeding West Indian turbulence, and\r\nyet be furious at a petition like that of 1797,[37] calling attention to\r\n\"the oppressed state of our brethren of the African race\" in this\r\ncountry, and to the interstate slave-trade. \"Considering the present\r\nextraordinary state of the West India Islands and of Europe,\" young John\r\nRutledge insisted \"that 'sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,'\r\nand that they ought to shut their door against any thing which had a\r\ntendency to produce the like confusion in this country.\" After excited\r\ndebate and some investigation by a special committee, the petition was\r\nordered, in both Senate and House, to be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n48. ~The Act of 1800.~ In the next Congress, the sixth, another petition\r\nthrew the House into paroxysms of slavery debate. Waln of Pennsylvania\r\npresented the petition of certain free colored men of Pennsylvania\r\npraying for a revision of the slave-trade laws and of the fugitive-slave\r\nlaw, and for prospective emancipation.[38] Waln moved the reference of\r\nthis memorial to a committee already appointed on the revision of the\r\nloosely drawn and poorly enforced Act of 1794.[39] Rutledge of South\r\nCarolina immediately arose. He opposed the motion, saying, that these\r\npetitions were continually coming in and stirring up discord; that it\r\nwas a good thing the Negroes were in slavery; and that already \"too much\r\nof this new-fangled French philosophy of liberty and equality\" had found\r\nits way among them. Others defended the right of petition, and declared\r\nthat none wished Congress to exceed its powers. Brown of Rhode Island, a\r\nnew figure in Congress, a man of distinguished services and from a\r\nwell-known family, boldly set forth the commercial philosophy of his\r\nState. \"We want money,\" said he, \"we want a navy; we ought therefore to\r\nuse the means to obtain it. We ought to go farther than has yet been\r\nproposed, and repeal the bills in question altogether, for why should we\r\nsee Great Britain getting all the slave trade to themselves; why may not\r\nour country be enriched by that lucrative traffic? There would not be a\r\nslave the more sold, but we should derive the benefits by importing from\r\nAfrica as well as that nation.\" Waln, in reply, contended that they\r\nshould look into \"the slave trade, much of which was still carrying on\r\nfrom Rhode Island, Boston and Pennsylvania.\" Hill of North Carolina\r\ncalled the House back from this general discussion to the petition in\r\nquestion, and, while willing to remedy any existing defect in the Act of\r\n1794, hoped the petition would not be received. Dana of Connecticut\r\ndeclared that the paper \"contained nothing but a farrago of the French\r\nmetaphysics of liberty and equality;\" and that \"it was likely to produce\r\nsome of the dreadful scenes of St. Domingo.\" The next day Rutledge again\r\nwarned the House against even discussing the matter, as \"very serious,\r\nnay, dreadful effects, must be the inevitable consequence.\" He held up\r\nthe most lurid pictures of the fatuity of the French Convention in\r\nlistening to the overtures of the \"three emissaries from St. Domingo,\"\r\nand thus yielding \"one of the finest islands in the world\" to \"scenes\r\nwhich had never been practised since the destruction of Carthage.\" \"But,\r\nsir,\" he continued, \"we have lived to see these dreadful scenes. These\r\nhorrid effects have succeeded what was conceived once to be trifling.\r\nMost important consequences may be the result, although gentlemen little\r\napprehend it. But we know the situation of things there, although they\r\ndo not, and knowing we deprecate it. There have been emissaries amongst\r\nus in the Southern States; they have begun their war upon us; an actual\r\norganization has commenced; we have had them meeting in their club\r\nrooms, and debating on that subject.... Sir, I do believe that persons\r\nhave been sent from France to feel the pulse of this country, to know\r\nwhether these [i.e., the Negroes] are the proper engines to make use of:\r\nthese people have been talked to; they have been tampered with, and this\r\nis going on.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, after censuring certain parts of this Negro petition, Congress\r\ncommitted the part on the slave-trade to the committee already\r\nappointed. Meantime, the Senate sent down a bill to amend the Act of\r\n1794, and the House took this bill under consideration.[40] Prolonged\r\ndebate ensued. Brown of Rhode Island again made a most elaborate plea\r\nfor throwing open the foreign slave-trade. Negroes, he said, bettered\r\ntheir condition by being enslaved, and thus it was morally wrong and\r\ncommercially indefensible to impose \"a heavy fine and imprisonment ...\r\nfor carrying on a trade so advantageous;\" or, if the trade must be\r\nstopped, then equalize the matter and abolish slavery too. Nichols of\r\nVirginia thought that surely the gentlemen would not advise the\r\nimportation of more Negroes; for while it \"was a fact, to be sure,\" that\r\nthey would thus improve their condition, \"would it be policy so to do?\"\r\nBayard of Delaware said that \"a more dishonorable item of revenue\" than\r\nthat derived from the slave-trade \"could not be established.\" Rutledge\r\nopposed the new bill as defective and impracticable: the former act, he\r\nsaid, was enough; the States had stopped the trade, and in addition the\r\nUnited States had sought to placate philanthropists by stopping the use\r\nof our ships in the trade. \"This was going very far indeed.\" New England\r\nfirst began the trade, and why not let them enjoy its profits now as\r\nwell as the English? The trade could not be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe bill was eventually recommitted and reported again.[41] \"On the\r\nquestion for its passing, a long and warm debate ensued,\" and several\r\nattempts to postpone it were made; it finally passed, however, only\r\nBrown of Rhode Island, Dent of Maryland, Rutledge and Huger of South\r\nCarolina, and Dickson of North Carolina voting against it, and 67 voting\r\nfor it.[42] This Act of May 10, 1800,[43] greatly strengthened the Act\r\nof 1794. The earlier act had prohibited citizens from equipping slavers\r\nfor the foreign trade; but this went so far as to forbid them having any\r\ninterest, direct or indirect, in such voyages, or serving on board\r\nslave-ships in any capacity. Imprisonment for two years was added to the\r\nformer fine of $2000, and United States commissioned ships were directed\r\nto capture such slavers as prizes. The slaves though forfeited by the\r\nowner, were not to go to the captor; and the act omitted to say what\r\ndisposition should be made of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n49. ~The Act of 1803.~ The Haytian revolt, having been among the main\r\ncauses of two laws, soon was the direct instigation to a third. The\r\nfrightened feeling in the South, when freedmen from the West Indies\r\nbegan to arrive in various ports, may well be imagined. On January 17,\r\n1803, the town of Wilmington, North Carolina, hastily memorialized\r\nCongress, stating the arrival of certain freed Negroes from Guadeloupe,\r\nand apprehending \"much danger to the peace and safety of the people of\r\nthe Southern States of the Union\" from the \"admission of persons of that\r\ndescription into the United States.\"[44] The House committee which\r\nconsidered this petition hastened to agree \"That the system of policy\r\nstated in the said memorial to exist, and to be now pursued in the\r\nFrench colonial government, of the West Indies, is fraught with danger\r\nto the peace and safety of the United States. That the fact stated to\r\nhave occurred in the prosecution of that system of policy, demands the\r\nprompt interference of the Government of the United States, as well\r\nLegislative as Executive.\"[45] The result was a bill providing for the\r\nforfeiture of any ship which should bring into States prohibiting the\r\nsame \"any negro, mulatto, or other person of color;\" the captain of the\r\nship was also to be punished. After some opposition[46] the bill became\r\na law, February 28, 1803.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n50. ~State of the Slave-Trade from 1789 to 1803.~ Meantime, in spite of\r\nthe prohibitory State laws, the African slave-trade to the United States\r\ncontinued to flourish. It was notorious that New England traders carried\r\non a large traffic.[48] Members stated on the floor of the House that\r\n\"it was much to be regretted that the severe and pointed statute against\r\nthe slave trade had been so little regarded. In defiance of its\r\nforbiddance and its penalties, it was well known that citizens and\r\nvessels of the United States were still engaged in that traffic.... In\r\nvarious parts of the nation, outfits were made for slave-voyages,\r\nwithout secrecy, shame, or apprehension.... Countenanced by their\r\nfellow-citizens at home, who were as ready to buy as they themselves\r\nwere to collect and to bring to market, they approached our Southern\r\nharbors and inlets, and clandestinely disembarked the sooty offspring of\r\nthe Eastern, upon the ill fated soil of the Western hemisphere. In this\r\nway, it had been computed that, during the last twelve months, twenty\r\nthousand enslaved negroes had been transported from Guinea, and, by\r\nsmuggling, added to the plantation stock of Georgia and South Carolina.\r\nSo little respect seems to have been paid to the existing prohibitory\r\nstatute, that it may almost be considered as disregarded by common\r\nconsent.\"[49]\r\n\r\nThese voyages were generally made under the flag of a foreign nation,\r\nand often the vessel was sold in a foreign port to escape confiscation.\r\nSouth Carolina's own Congressman confessed that although the State had\r\nprohibited the trade since 1788, she \"was unable to enforce\" her laws.\r\n\"With navigable rivers running into the heart of it,\" said he, \"it was\r\nimpossible, with our means, to prevent our Eastern brethren, who, in\r\nsome parts of the Union, in defiance of the authority of the General\r\nGovernment, have been engaged in this trade, from introducing them into\r\nthe country. The law was completely evaded, and, for the last year or\r\ntwo [1802-3], Africans were introduced into the country in numbers\r\nlittle short, I believe, of what they would have been had the trade been\r\na legal one.\"[50] The same tale undoubtedly might have been told of\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n51. ~The South Carolina Repeal of 1803.~ This vast and apparently\r\nirrepressible illicit traffic was one of three causes which led South\r\nCarolina, December 17, 1803, to throw aside all pretence and legalize\r\nher growing slave-trade; the other two causes were the growing certainty\r\nof total prohibition of the traffic in 1808, and the recent purchase of\r\nLouisiana by the United States, with its vast prospective demand for\r\nslave labor. Such a combination of advantages, which meant fortunes to\r\nplanters and Charleston slave-merchants, could not longer be withheld\r\nfrom them; the prohibition was repealed, and the United States became\r\nagain, for the first time in at least five years, a legal slave mart.\r\nThis action shocked the nation, frightening Southern States with visions\r\nof an influx of untrained barbarians and servile insurrections, and\r\narousing and intensifying the anti-slavery feeling of the North, which\r\nhad long since come to think of the trade, so far as legal enactment\r\nwent, as a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nScarcely a month after this repeal, Bard of Pennsylvania solemnly\r\naddressed Congress on the matter. \"For many reasons,\" said he, \"this\r\nHouse must have been justly surprised by a recent measure of one of the\r\nSouthern States. The impressions, however, which that measure gave my\r\nmind, were deep and painful. Had I been informed that some formidable\r\nforeign Power had invaded our country, I would not, I ought not, be more\r\nalarmed than on hearing that South Carolina had repealed her law\r\nprohibiting the importation of slaves.... Our hands are tied, and we are\r\nobliged to stand confounded, while we see the flood-gate opened, and\r\npouring incalculable miseries into our country.\"[51] He then moved, as\r\nthe utmost legal measure, a tax of ten dollars per head on slaves\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nDebate on this proposition did not occur until February 14, when Lowndes\r\nexplained the circumstances of the repeal, and a long controversy took\r\nplace.[52] Those in favor of the tax argued that the trade was wrong,\r\nand that the tax would serve as some slight check; the tax was not\r\ninequitable, for if a State did not wish to bear it she had only to\r\nprohibit the trade; the tax would add to the revenue, and be at the same\r\ntime a moral protest against an unjust and dangerous traffic. Against\r\nthis it was argued that if the tax furnished a revenue it would defeat\r\nits own object, and make prohibition more difficult in 1808; it was\r\ninequitable, because it was aimed against one State, and would fall\r\nexclusively on agriculture; it would give national sanction to the\r\ntrade; it would look \"like an attempt in the General Government to\r\ncorrect a State for the undisputed exercise of its constitutional\r\npowers;\" the revenue would be inconsiderable, and the United States had\r\nnothing to do with the moral principle; while a prohibitory tax would be\r\ndefensible, a small tax like this would be useless as a protection and\r\ncriminal as a revenue measure.\r\n\r\nThe whole debate hinged on the expediency of the measure, few defending\r\nSouth Carolina's action.[53] Finally, a bill was ordered to be brought\r\nin, which was done on the 17th.[54] Another long debate took place,\r\ncovering substantially the same ground. It was several times hinted that\r\nif the matter were dropped South Carolina might again prohibit the\r\ntrade. This, and the vehement opposition, at last resulted in the\r\npostponement of the bill, and it was not heard from again during the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\r\n52. ~The Louisiana Slave-Trade, 1803-1805.~ About this time the cession\r\nof Louisiana brought before Congress the question of the status of\r\nslavery and the slave-trade in the Territories. Twice or thrice before\r\nhad the subject called for attention. The first time was in the Congress\r\nof the Confederation, when, by the Ordinance of 1787,[55] both slavery\r\nand the slave-trade were excluded from the Northwest Territory. In 1790\r\nCongress had accepted the cession of North Carolina back lands on the\r\nexpress condition that slavery there be undisturbed.[56] Nothing had\r\nbeen said as to slavery in the South Carolina cession (1787),[57] but it\r\nwas tacitly understood that the provision of the Northwest Ordinance\r\nwould not be applied. In 1798 the bill introduced for the cession of\r\nMississippi contained a specific declaration that the anti-slavery\r\nclause of 1787 should not be included.[58] The bill passed the Senate,\r\nbut caused long and excited debate in the House.[59] It was argued, on\r\nthe one hand, that the case in Mississippi was different from that in\r\nthe Northwest Territory, because slavery was a legal institution in all\r\nthe surrounding country, and to prohibit the institution was virtually\r\nto prohibit the settling of the country. On the other hand, Gallatin\r\ndeclared that if this amendment should not obtain, \"he knew not how\r\nslaves could be prevented from being introduced by way of New Orleans,\r\nby persons who are not citizens of the United States.\" It was moved to\r\nstrike out the excepting clause; but the motion received only twelve\r\nvotes,--an apparent indication that Congress either did not appreciate\r\nthe great precedent it was establishing, or was reprehensibly careless.\r\nHarper of South Carolina then succeeded in building up the Charleston\r\nslave-trade interest by a section forbidding the slave traffic from\r\n\"without the limits of the United States.\" Thatcher moved to strike out\r\nthe last clause of this amendment, and thus to prohibit the interstate\r\ntrade, but he failed to get a second.[60] Thus the act passed, punishing\r\nthe introduction of slaves from without the country by a fine of $300\r\nfor each slave, and freeing the slave.[61]\r\n\r\nIn 1804 President Jefferson communicated papers to Congress on the\r\nstatus of slavery and the slave-trade in Louisiana.[62] The Spanish had\r\nallowed the traffic by edict in 1793, France had not stopped it, and\r\nGovernor Claiborne had refrained from interference. A bill erecting a\r\nterritorial government was already pending.[63] The Northern \"District\r\nof Louisiana\" was placed under the jurisdiction of Indiana Territory,\r\nand was made subject to the provisions of the Ordinance of 1787. Various\r\nattempts were made to amend the part of the bill referring to the\r\nSouthern Territory: first, so as completely to prohibit the\r\nslave-trade;[64] then to compel the emancipation at a certain age of all\r\nthose imported;[65] next, to confine all importation to that from the\r\nStates;[66] and, finally, to limit it further to slaves imported before\r\nSouth Carolina opened her ports.[67] The last two amendments prevailed,\r\nand the final act also extended to the Territory the Acts of 1794 and\r\n1803. Only slaves imported before May 1, 1798, could be introduced, and\r\nthose must be slaves of actual settlers.[68] All slaves illegally\r\nimported were freed.\r\n\r\nThis stringent act was limited to one year. The next year, in accordance\r\nwith the urgent petition of the inhabitants, a bill was introduced\r\nagainst these restrictions.[69] By dexterous wording, this bill, which\r\nbecame a law March 2, 1805,[70] swept away all restrictions upon the\r\nslave-trade except that relating to foreign ports, and left even this\r\nprovision so ambiguous that, later, by judicial interpretation of the\r\nlaw,[71] the foreign slave-trade was allowed, at least for a time.\r\n\r\nSuch a stream of slaves now poured into the new Territory that the\r\nfollowing year a committee on the matter was appointed by the House.[72]\r\nThe committee reported that they \"are in possession of the fact, that\r\nAfrican slaves, lately imported into Charleston, have been thence\r\nconveyed into the territory of Orleans, and, in their opinion, this\r\npractice will be continued to a very great extent, while there is no law\r\nto prevent it.\"[73] The House ordered a bill checking this to be\r\nprepared; and such a bill was reported, but was soon dropped.[74]\r\nImportations into South Carolina during this time reached enormous\r\nproportions. Senator Smith of that State declared from official returns\r\nthat, between 1803 and 1807, 39,075 Negroes were imported into\r\nCharleston, most of whom went to the Territories.[75]\r\n\r\n\r\n53. ~Last Attempts at Taxation, 1805-1806.~ So alarming did the trade\r\nbecome that North Carolina passed a resolution in December, 1804,[76]\r\nproposing that the States give Congress power to prohibit the trade.\r\nMassachusetts,[77] Vermont,[78] New Hampshire,[79] and Maryland[80]\r\nresponded; and a joint resolution was introduced in the House, proposing\r\nas an amendment to the Constitution \"That the Congress of the United\r\nStates shall have power to prevent the further importation of slaves\r\ninto the United States and the Territories thereof.\"[81] Nothing came\r\nof this effort; but meantime the project of taxation was revived. A\r\nmotion to this effect, made in February, 1805, was referred to a\r\nCommittee of the Whole, but was not discussed. Early in the first\r\nsession of the ninth Congress the motion of 1805 was renewed; and\r\nalthough again postponed on the assurance that South Carolina was about\r\nto stop the trade,[82] it finally came up for debate January 20,\r\n1806.[83] Then occurred a most stubborn legislative battle, which lasted\r\nduring the whole session.[84] Several amendments to the motion were\r\nfirst introduced, so as to make it apply to all immigrants, and again to\r\nall \"persons of color.\" As in the former debate, it was proposed to\r\nsubstitute a resolution of censure on South Carolina. All these\r\namendments were lost. A long debate on the expediency of the measure\r\nfollowed, on the old grounds. Early of Georgia dwelt especially on the\r\ndouble taxation it would impose on Georgia; others estimated that a\r\nrevenue of one hundred thousand dollars might be derived from the tax, a\r\nsum sufficient to replace the tax on pepper and medicines. Angry charges\r\nand counter-charges were made,--e.g., that Georgia, though ashamed\r\nopenly to avow the trade, participated in it as well as South Carolina.\r\n\"Some recriminations ensued between several members, on the\r\nparticipation of the traders of some of the New England States in\r\ncarrying on the slave trade.\" Finally, January 22, by a vote of 90 to\r\n25, a tax bill was ordered to be brought in.[85] One was reported on the\r\n27th.[86] Every sort of opposition was resorted to. On the one hand,\r\nattempts were made to amend it so as to prohibit importation after 1807,\r\nand to prevent importation into the Territories; on the other hand,\r\nattempts were made to recommit and postpone the measure. It finally got\r\na third reading, but was recommitted to a select committee, and\r\ndisappeared until February 14.[87] Being then amended so as to provide\r\nfor the forfeiture of smuggled cargoes, but saying nothing as to the\r\ndisposition of the slaves, it was again relegated to a committee, after\r\na vote of 69 to 42 against postponement.[88] On March 4 it appeared\r\nagain, and a motion to reject it was lost. Finally, in the midst of the\r\nwar scare and the question of non-importation of British goods, the bill\r\nwas apparently forgotten, and the last attempt to tax imported slaves\r\nended, like the others, in failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n54. ~Key-Note of the Period.~ One of the last acts of this period\r\nstrikes again the key-note which sounded throughout the whole of it. On\r\nFebruary 20, 1806, after considerable opposition, a bill to prohibit\r\ntrade with San Domingo passed the Senate.[89] In the House it was\r\ncharged by one side that the measure was dictated by France, and by the\r\nother, that it originated in the fear of countenancing Negro\r\ninsurrection. The bill, however, became a law, and by continuations\r\nremained on the statute-books until 1809. Even at that distance the\r\nnightmare of the Haytian insurrection continued to haunt the South, and\r\na proposal to reopen trade with the island caused wild John Randolph to\r\npoint out the \"dreadful evil\" of a \"direct trade betwixt the town of\r\nCharleston and the ports of the island of St. Domingo.\"[90]\r\n\r\nOf the twenty years from 1787 to 1807 it can only be said that they\r\nwere, on the whole, a period of disappointment so far as the suppression\r\nof the slave-trade was concerned. Fear, interest, and philanthropy\r\nunited for a time in an effort which bade fair to suppress the trade;\r\nthen the real weakness of the constitutional compromise appeared, and\r\nthe interests of the few overcame the fears and the humanity of the\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Prince, _Digest of the Laws of Georgia_, p. 786; Marbury\r\n      and Crawford, _Digest of the Laws of Georgia_, pp. 440, 442.\r\n      The exact text of this act appears not to be extant.

It would hardly be too much to say that the\r\nHaytian revolution, in addition to its influence in the years from 1791\r\nto 1806, was one of the main causes that rendered the accomplishment of\r\nthis aim possible at the earliest constitutional moment. To the great\r\ninfluence of the fears of the South was added the failure of the French\r\ndesigns on Louisiana, of which Toussaint L'Ouverture was the most\r\nprobable cause. The cession of Louisiana in 1803 challenged and aroused\r\nthe North on the slavery question again; put the Carolina and Georgia\r\nslave-traders in the saddle, to the dismay of the Border States; and\r\nbrought the whole slave-trade question vividly before the public\r\nconscience. Another scarcely less potent influence was, naturally, the\r\ngreat anti-slavery movement in England, which after a mighty struggle of\r\neighteen years was about to gain its first victory in the British Act of\r\n1807.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson, in his pacificatory message of December 2, 1806,\r\nsaid: \"I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the\r\nperiod at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to\r\nwithdraw the citizens of the United States from all further\r\nparticipation in those violations of human rights which have been so\r\nlong continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the\r\nmorality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country, have\r\nlong been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may pass can take\r\nprohibitory effect till the first day of the year one thousand eight\r\nhundred and eight, yet the intervening period is not too long to\r\nprevent, by timely notice, expeditions which cannot be completed before\r\nthat day.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this recommendation, the very next day Senator Bradley\r\nof Vermont introduced into the Senate a bill which, after a complicated\r\nlegislative history, became the Act of March 2, 1807, prohibiting the\r\nAfrican slave-trade.[2]\r\n\r\nThree main questions were to be settled by this bill: first, and most\r\nprominent, that of the disposal of illegally imported Africans; second,\r\nthat of the punishment of those concerned in the importation; third,\r\nthat of the proper limitation of the interstate traffic by water.\r\n\r\nThe character of the debate on these three questions, as well as the\r\nstate of public opinion, is illustrated by the fact that forty of the\r\nsixty pages of officially reported debates are devoted to the first\r\nquestion, less than twenty to the second, and only two to the third. A\r\nsad commentary on the previous enforcement of State and national laws is\r\nthe readiness with which it was admitted that wholesale violations of\r\nthe law would take place; indeed, Southern men declared that no strict\r\nlaw against the slave-trade could be executed in the South, and that it\r\nwas only by playing on the motives of personal interest that the trade\r\ncould be checked. The question of punishment indicated the slowly\r\nchanging moral attitude of the South toward the slave system. Early\r\nboldly said, \"A large majority of people in the Southern States do not\r\nconsider slavery as even an evil.\"[3] The South, in fact, insisted on\r\nregarding man-stealing as a minor offence, a \"misdemeanor\" rather than a\r\n\"crime.\" Finally, in the short and sharp debate on the interstate\r\ncoastwise trade, the growing economic side of the slavery question came\r\nto the front, the vested interests' argument was squarely put, and the\r\nfuture interstate trade almost consciously provided for.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, it is doubtful as to how far it was expected\r\nthat the Act of 1807 would check the slave traffic; at any rate, so far\r\nas the South was concerned, there seemed to be an evident desire to\r\nlimit the trade, but little thought that this statute would definitively\r\nsuppress it.\r\n\r\n56. ~The First Question: How shall illegally imported Africans be\r\ndisposed of?~ The dozen or more propositions on the question of the\r\ndisposal of illegally imported Africans may be divided into two chief\r\nheads, representing two radically opposed parties: 1. That illegally\r\nimported Africans be free, although they might be indentured for a term\r\nof years or removed from the country. 2. That such Africans be sold as\r\nslaves.[4] The arguments on these two propositions, which were many and\r\nfar-reaching, may be roughly divided into three classes, political,\r\nconstitutional, and moral.\r\n\r\nThe political argument, reduced to its lowest terms, ran thus: those\r\nwishing to free the Negroes illegally imported declared that to enslave\r\nthem would be to perpetrate the very evil which the law was designed to\r\nstop. \"By the same law,\" they said, \"we condemn the man-stealer and\r\nbecome the receivers of his stolen goods. We punish the criminal, and\r\nthen step into his place, and complete the crime.\"[5] They said that the\r\nobjection to free Negroes was no valid excuse; for if the Southern\r\npeople really feared this class, they would consent to the imposing of\r\nsuch penalties on illicit traffic as would stop the importation of a\r\nsingle slave.[6] Moreover, \"forfeiture\" and sale of the Negroes implied\r\na property right in them which did not exist.[7] Waiving this technical\r\npoint, and allowing them to be \"forfeited\" to the government, then the\r\ngovernment should either immediately set them free, or, at the most,\r\nindenture them for a term of years; otherwise, the law would be an\r\nencouragement to violators. \"It certainly will be,\" said they, \"if the\r\nimporter can find means to evade the penalty of the act; for there he\r\nhas all the advantage of a market enhanced by our ineffectual attempt to\r\nprohibit.\"[8] They claimed that even the indenturing of the ignorant\r\nbarbarian for life was better than slavery; and Sloan declared that the\r\nNorthern States would receive the freed Negroes willingly rather than\r\nhave them enslaved.[9]\r\n\r\nThe argument of those who insisted that the Negroes should be sold was\r\ntersely put by Macon: \"In adopting our measures on this subject, we must\r\npass such a law as can be executed.\"[10] Early expanded this: \"It is a\r\nprinciple in legislation, as correct as any which has ever prevailed,\r\nthat to give effect to laws you must not make them repugnant to the\r\npassions and wishes of the people among whom they are to operate. How\r\nthen, in this instance, stands the fact? Do not gentlemen from every\r\nquarter of the Union prove, on the discussion of every question that has\r\never arisen in the House, having the most remote bearing on the giving\r\nfreedom to the Africans in the bosom of our country, that it has excited\r\nthe deepest sensibility in the breasts of those where slavery exists?\r\nAnd why is this so? It is, because those who, from experience, know the\r\nextent of the evil, believe that the most formidable aspect in which it\r\ncan present itself, is by making these people free among them. Yes, sir,\r\nthough slavery is an evil, regretted by every man in the country, to\r\nhave among us in any considerable quantity persons of this description,\r\nis an evil far greater than slavery itself. Does any gentleman want\r\nproof of this? I answer that all proof is useless; no fact can be more\r\nnotorious. With this belief on the minds of the people where slavery\r\nexists, and where the importation will take place, if at all, we are\r\nabout to turn loose in a state of freedom all persons brought in after\r\nthe passage of this law. I ask gentlemen to reflect and say whether such\r\na law, opposed to the ideas, the passions, the views, and the affections\r\nof the people of the Southern States, can be executed? I tell them, no;\r\nit is impossible--why? Because no man will inform--why? Because to\r\ninform will be to lead to an evil which will be deemed greater than the\r\noffence of which information is given, because it will be opposed to the\r\nprinciple of self-preservation, and to the love of family. No, no man\r\nwill be disposed to jeopard his life, and the lives of his countrymen.\r\nAnd if no one dare inform, the whole authority of the Government cannot\r\ncarry the law into effect. The whole people will rise up against it.\r\nWhy? Because to enforce it would be to turn loose, in the bosom of the\r\ncountry, firebrands that would consume them.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThis was the more tragic form of the argument; it also had a mercenary\r\nside, which was presented with equal emphasis. It was repeatedly said\r\nthat the only way to enforce the law was to play off individual\r\ninterests against each other. The profit from the sale of illegally\r\nimported Negroes was declared to be the only sufficient \"inducement to\r\ngive information of their importation.\"[12] \"Give up the idea of\r\nforfeiture, and I challenge the gentleman to invent fines, penalties, or\r\npunishments of any sort, sufficient to restrain the slave trade.\"[13]\r\nIf such Negroes be freed, \"I tell you that slaves will continue to be\r\nimported as heretofore.... You cannot get hold of the ships employed in\r\nthis traffic. Besides, slaves will be brought into Georgia from East\r\nFlorida. They will be brought into the Mississippi Territory from the\r\nbay of Mobile. You cannot inflict any other penalty, or devise any other\r\nadequate means of prevention, than a forfeiture of the Africans in whose\r\npossession they may be found after importation.\"[14] Then, too, when\r\nforeigners smuggled in Negroes, \"who then ... could be operated on, but\r\nthe purchasers? There was the rub--it was their interest alone which, by\r\nbeing operated on, would produce a check. Snap their purse-strings,\r\nbreak open their strong box, deprive them of their slaves, and by\r\ndestroying the temptation to buy, you put an end to the trade, ...\r\nnothing short of a forfeiture of the slave would afford an effectual\r\nremedy.\"[15] Again, it was argued that it was impossible to prevent\r\nimported Negroes from becoming slaves, or, what was just as bad, from\r\nbeing sold as vagabonds or indentured for life.[16] Even our own laws,\r\nit was said, recognize the title of the African slave factor in the\r\ntransported Negroes; and if the importer have no title, why do we\r\nlegislate? Why not let the African immigrant alone to get on as he may,\r\njust as we do the Irish immigrant?[17] If he should be returned to\r\nAfrica, his home could not be found, and he would in all probability be\r\nsold into slavery again.[18]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional argument was not urged as seriously as the foregoing;\r\nbut it had a considerable place. On the one hand, it was urged that if\r\nthe Negroes were forfeited, they were forfeited to the United States\r\ngovernment, which could dispose of them as it saw fit;[19] on the other\r\nhand, it was said that the United States, as owner, was subject to State\r\nlaws, and could not free the Negroes contrary to such laws.[20] Some\r\nalleged that the freeing of such Negroes struck at the title to all\r\nslave property;[21] others thought that, as property in slaves was not\r\nrecognized in the Constitution, it could not be in a statute.[22] The\r\nquestion also arose as to the source of the power of Congress over the\r\nslave-trade. Southern men derived it from the clause on commerce, and\r\ndeclared that it exceeded the power of Congress to declare Negroes\r\nimported into a slave State, free, against the laws of that State; that\r\nCongress could not determine what should or should not be property in a\r\nState.[23] Northern men replied that, according to this principle,\r\nforfeiture and sale in Massachusetts would be illegal; that the power of\r\nCongress over the trade was derived from the restraining clause, as a\r\nnon-existent power could not be restrained; and that the United States\r\ncould act under her general powers as executor of the Law of\r\nNations.[24]\r\n\r\nThe moral argument as to the disposal of illegally imported Negroes was\r\ninterlarded with all the others. On the one side, it began with the\r\n\"Rights of Man,\" and descended to a stickling for the decent appearance\r\nof the statute-book; on the other side, it began with the uplifting of\r\nthe heathen, and descended to a denial of the applicability of moral\r\nprinciples to the question. Said Holland of North Carolina: \"It is\r\nadmitted that the condition of the slaves in the Southern States is much\r\nsuperior to that of those in Africa. Who, then, will say that the trade\r\nis immoral?\"[25] But, in fact, \"morality has nothing to do with this\r\ntraffic,\"[26] for, as Joseph Clay declared, \"it must appear to every man\r\nof common sense, that the question could be considered in a commercial\r\npoint of view only.\"[27] The other side declared that, \"by the laws of\r\nGod and man,\" these captured Negroes are \"entitled to their freedom as\r\nclearly and absolutely as we are;\"[28] nevertheless, some were willing\r\nto leave them to the tender mercies of the slave States, so long as the\r\nstatute-book was disgraced by no explicit recognition of slavery.[29]\r\nSuch arguments brought some sharp sarcasm on those who seemed anxious\r\n\"to legislate for the honor and glory of the statute book;\"[30] some\r\ndesired \"to know what honor you will derive from a law that will be\r\nbroken every day of your lives.\"[31] They would rather boldly sell the\r\nNegroes and turn the proceeds over to charity.\r\n\r\nThe final settlement of the question was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"SECTION 4.... And neither the importer, nor any person\r\n    or persons claiming from or under him, shall hold any right or\r\n    title whatsoever to any negro, mulatto, or person of color, nor\r\n    to the service or labor thereof, who may be imported or brought\r\n    within the United States, or territories thereof, in violation\r\n    of this law, but the same shall remain subject to any\r\n    regulations not contravening the provisions of this act, which\r\n    the Legislatures of the several States or Territories at any\r\n    time hereafter may make, for disposing of any such negro,\r\n    mulatto, or person of color.\"[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n57. ~The Second Question: How shall Violations be punished?~ The next\r\npoint in importance was that of the punishment of offenders. The\r\nhalf-dozen specific propositions reduce themselves to two: 1. A\r\nviolation should be considered a crime or felony, and be punished by\r\ndeath; 2. A violation should be considered a misdemeanor, and be\r\npunished by fine and imprisonment.[33]\r\n\r\nAdvocates of the severer punishment dwelt on the enormity of the\r\noffence. It was \"one of the highest crimes man could commit,\" and \"a\r\ncaptain of a ship engaged in this traffic was guilty of murder.\"[34] The\r\nlaw of God punished the crime with death, and any one would rather be\r\nhanged than be enslaved.[35] It was a peculiarly deliberate crime, in\r\nwhich the offender did not act in sudden passion, but had ample time for\r\nreflection.[36] Then, too, crimes of much less magnitude are punished\r\nwith death. Shall we punish the stealer of $50 with death, and the\r\nman-stealer with imprisonment only?[37] Piracy, forgery, and fraudulent\r\nsinking of vessels are punishable with death, \"yet these are crimes only\r\nagainst property; whereas the importation of slaves, a crime committed\r\nagainst the liberty of man, and inferior only to murder or treason, is\r\naccounted nothing but a misdemeanor.\"[38] Here, indeed, lies the remedy\r\nfor the evil of freeing illegally imported Negroes,--in making the\r\npenalty so severe that none will be brought in; if the South is sincere,\r\n\"they will unite to a man to execute the law.\"[39] To free such Negroes\r\nis dangerous; to enslave them, wrong; to return them, impracticable; to\r\nindenture them, difficult,--therefore, by a death penalty, keep them\r\nfrom being imported.[40] Here the East had a chance to throw back the\r\ntaunts of the South, by urging the South to unite with them in hanging\r\nthe New England slave-traders, assuring the South that \"so far from\r\ncharging their Southern brethren with cruelty or severity in hanging\r\nthem, they would acknowledge the favor with gratitude.\"[41] Finally, if\r\nthe Southerners would refuse to execute so severe a law because they did\r\nnot consider the offence great, they would probably refuse to execute\r\nany law at all for the same reason.[42]\r\n\r\nThe opposition answered that the death penalty was more than\r\nproportionate to the crime, and therefore \"immoral.\"[43] \"I cannot\r\nbelieve,\" said Stanton of Rhode Island, \"that a man ought to be hung for\r\nonly stealing a negro.\"[44] It was argued that the trade was after all\r\nbut a \"transfer from one master to another;\"[45] that slavery was worse\r\nthan the slave-trade, and the South did not consider slavery a crime:\r\nhow could it then punish the trade so severely and not reflect on the\r\ninstitution?[46] Severity, it was said, was also inexpedient: severity\r\noften increases crime; if the punishment is too great, people will\r\nsympathize with offenders and will not inform against them. Said Mr.\r\nMosely: \"When the penalty is excessive or disproportioned to the\r\noffence, it will naturally create a repugnance to the law, and render\r\nits execution odious.\"[47] John Randolph argued against even fine and\r\nimprisonment, \"on the ground that such an excessive penalty could not,\r\nin such case, be constitutionally imposed by a Government possessed of\r\nthe limited powers of the Government of the United States.\"[48]\r\n\r\nThe bill as passed punished infractions as follows:--\r\n\r\n    For equipping a slaver, a fine of $20,000 and forfeiture of the\r\n    ship.\r\n\r\n    For transporting Negroes, a fine of $5000 and forfeiture of the\r\n    ship and Negroes.\r\n\r\n    For transporting and selling Negroes, a fine of $1000 to\r\n    $10,000, imprisonment from 5 to 10 years, and forfeiture of the\r\n    ship and Negroes.\r\n\r\n    For knowingly buying illegally imported Negroes, a fine of $800\r\n    for each Negro, and forfeiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n58. ~The Third Question: How shall the Interstate Coastwise Slave-Trade\r\nbe protected?~ The first proposition was to prohibit the coastwise\r\nslave-trade altogether,[49] but an amendment reported to the House\r\nallowed it \"in any vessel or species of craft whatever.\" It is probable\r\nthat the first proposition would have prevailed, had it not been for the\r\nvehement opposition of Randolph and Early.[50] They probably foresaw the\r\nvalue which Virginia would derive from this trade in the future, and\r\nconsequently Randolph violently declared that if the amendment did not\r\nprevail, \"the Southern people would set the law at defiance. He would\r\nbegin the example.\" He maintained that by the first proposition \"the\r\nproprietor of sacred and chartered rights is prevented the\r\nConstitutional use of his property.\"[51] The Conference Committee\r\nfinally arranged a compromise, forbidding the coastwise trade for\r\npurposes of sale in vessels under forty tons.[52] This did not suit\r\nEarly, who declared that the law with this provision \"would not prevent\r\nthe introduction of a single slave.\"[53] Randolph, too, would \"rather\r\nlose the bill, he had rather lose all the bills of the session, he had\r\nrather lose every bill passed since the establishment of the Government,\r\nthan agree to the provision contained in this slave bill.\"[54] He\r\npredicted the severance of the slave and the free States, if disunion\r\nshould ever come. Congress was, however, weary with the dragging of the\r\nbill, and it passed both Houses with the compromise provision. Randolph\r\nwas so dissatisfied that he had a committee appointed the next day, and\r\nintroduced an amendatory bill. Both this bill and another similar one,\r\nintroduced at the next session, failed of consideration.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\n59. ~Legislative History of the Bill.~[56] On December 12, 1805, Senator\r\nStephen R. Bradley of Vermont gave notice of a bill to prohibit the\r\nintroduction of slaves after 1808. By a vote of 18 to 9 leave was\r\ngiven, and the bill read a first time on the 17th. On the 18th, however,\r\nit was postponed until \"the first Monday in December, 1806.\" The\r\npresidential message mentioning the matter, Senator Bradley, December 3,\r\n1806, gave notice of a similar bill, which was brought in on the 8th,\r\nand on the 9th referred to a committee consisting of Bradley, Stone,\r\nGiles, Gaillard, and Baldwin. This bill passed, after some\r\nconsideration, January 27. It provided, among other things, that\r\nviolations of the act should be felony, punishable with death, and\r\nforbade the interstate coast-trade.[57]\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the House, Mr. Bidwell of Massachusetts had proposed,\r\nFebruary 4, 1806, as an amendment to a bill taxing slaves imported, that\r\nimportation after December 31, 1807, be prohibited, on pain of fine and\r\nimprisonment and forfeiture of ship.[58] This was rejected by a vote of\r\n86 to 17. On December 3, 1806, the House, in appointing committees on\r\nthe message, \"_Ordered_, That Mr. Early, Mr. Thomas M. Randolph, Mr.\r\nJohn Campbell, Mr. Kenan, Mr. Cook, Mr. Kelly, and Mr. Van Rensselaer be\r\nappointed a committee\" on the slave-trade. This committee reported a\r\nbill on the 15th, which was considered, but finally, December 18,\r\nrecommitted. It was reported in an amended form on the 19th, and amended\r\nin Committee of the Whole so as to make violation a misdemeanor\r\npunishable by fine and imprisonment, instead of a felony punishable by\r\ndeath.[59] A struggle over the disposal of the cargo then ensued. A\r\nmotion by Bidwell to except the cargo from forfeiture was lost, 77 to\r\n39. Another motion by Bidwell may be considered the crucial vote on the\r\nwhole bill: it was an amendment to the forfeiture clause, and read,\r\n_\"Provided, that no person shall be sold as a slave by virtue of this\r\nact.\"_[60] This resulted in a tie vote, 60 to 60; but the casting vote\r\nof the Speaker, Macon of North Carolina, defeated it. New England voted\r\nsolidly in favor of it, the Middle States stood 4 for and 2 against it,\r\nand the six Southern States stood solid against it. On January 8 the\r\nbill went again to a select committee of seventeen, by a vote of 76 to\r\n46. The bill was reported back amended January 20, and on the 28th the\r\nSenate bill was also presented to the House. On the 9th, 10th, and 11th\r\nof February both bills were considered in Committee of the Whole, and\r\nthe Senate bill finally replaced the House bill, after several\r\namendments had been made.[61] The bill was then passed, by a vote of 113\r\nto 5.[62] The Senate agreed to the amendments, including that\r\nsubstituting fine and imprisonment for the death penalty, but asked for\r\na conference on the provision which left the interstate coast-trade\r\nfree. The six conferees succeeded in bringing the Houses to agree, by\r\nlimiting the trade to vessels over forty tons and requiring registry of\r\nthe slaves.[63]\r\n\r\nThe following diagram shows in graphic form the legislative history of\r\nthe act:--[64]\r\n\r\n                     _Senate._      _1805._       _House._\r\nBradley gives notice.    +        Dec. 12.\r\nLeave given; bill read.  +             17.\r\nPostponed one year.      +             18.\r\n                         |          _1806._\r\n                                  Feb.  4.         + Bidwell's amendment.\r\nNotice.                  +        Dec.  3.         + Committee on\r\nBill introduced.         +              8.         |  slave trade.\r\nCommitted.               +              9.         |\r\n                         |             15.         + Bill reported.\r\n                         |             17.         |\r\n                         |             18.         |\r\n                         |             19.         |\r\n                         |             23.         |\r\n                         |             29.         |\r\n                         |             31.         |\r\n                         |          _1807._        |\r\n                         |        Jan.  5.         |\r\n                         |              7.         |\r\n                         |              8.         + Read third time;\r\nReported.                +             15.         |  recommitted.\r\n                         |             16.         |\r\n                         |             20.         + Reported\r\nThird reading.           +             26.         |  amended.\r\nPASSED.                  +             27.         |\r\n                         \\ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   |\r\n                                       28.      |  | Senate bill\r\n                                  Feb.  9.      |  |  reported.\r\n                                       10.      |  |\r\n                                       11.      +  | Senate bill\r\n                                       12.      |     amended.\r\nReported from House.                   13.      +       PASSED.\r\n                          _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |\r\nReported to House.       |             17.

Those in the House were prolonged and bitter, and hinged\r\nespecially on the disposal of the slaves, the punishment of offenders,\r\nand the coast-trade. Men were continually changing their votes, and the\r\nbill see-sawed backward and forward, in committee and out, until the\r\nHouse was thoroughly worn out. On the whole, the strong anti-slavery\r\nmen, like Bidwell and Sloan, were outgeneraled by Southerners, like\r\nEarly and Williams; and, considering the immense moral backing of the\r\nanti-slavery party from the Revolutionary fathers down, the bill of 1807\r\ncan hardly be regarded as a great anti-slavery victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n60. ~Enforcement of the Act.~ The period so confidently looked forward\r\nto by the constitutional fathers had at last arrived; the slave-trade\r\nwas prohibited, and much oratory and poetry were expended in celebration\r\nof the event. In the face of this, let us see how the Act of 1807 was\r\nenforced and what it really accomplished. It is noticeable, in the first\r\nplace, that there was no especial set of machinery provided for the\r\nenforcement of this act. The work fell first to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, as head of the customs collection. Then, through the activity\r\nof cruisers, the Secretary of the Navy gradually came to have oversight,\r\nand eventually the whole matter was lodged with him, although the\r\nDepartments of State and War were more or less active on different\r\noccasions. Later, at the advent of the Lincoln government, the\r\nDepartment of the Interior was charged with the enforcement of the\r\nslave-trade laws. It would indeed be surprising if, amid so much\r\nuncertainty and shifting of responsibility, the law were not poorly\r\nenforced. Poor enforcement, moreover, in the years 1808 to 1820 meant\r\nfar more than at almost any other period; for these years were, all\r\nover the European world, a time of stirring economic change, and the set\r\nwhich forces might then take would in a later period be unchangeable\r\nwithout a cataclysm. Perhaps from 1808 to 1814, in the midst of\r\nagitation and war, there was some excuse for carelessness. From 1814 on,\r\nhowever, no such palliation existed, and the law was probably enforced\r\nas the people who made it wished it enforced.\r\n\r\nMost of the Southern States rather tardily passed the necessary\r\nsupplementary acts disposing of illegally imported Africans. A few\r\nappear not to have passed any. Some of these laws, like the\r\nAlabama-Mississippi Territory Act of 1815,[66] directed such Negroes to\r\nbe \"sold by the proper officer of the court, to the highest bidder, at\r\npublic auction, for ready money.\" One-half the proceeds went to the\r\ninformer or to the collector of customs, the other half to the public\r\ntreasury. Other acts, like that of North Carolina in 1816,[67] directed\r\nthe Negroes to \"be sold and disposed of for the use of the state.\"\r\nOne-fifth of the proceeds went to the informer. The Georgia Act of\r\n1817[68] directed that the slaves be either sold or given to the\r\nColonization Society for transportation, providing the society reimburse\r\nthe State for all expense incurred, and pay for the transportation. In\r\nthis manner, machinery of somewhat clumsy build and varying pattern was\r\nprovided for the carrying out of the national act.\r\n\r\n\r\n61. ~Evidence of the Continuance of the Trade.~ Undoubtedly, the Act of\r\n1807 came very near being a dead letter. The testimony supporting this\r\nview is voluminous. It consists of presidential messages, reports of\r\ncabinet officers, letters of collectors of revenue, letters of district\r\nattorneys, reports of committees of Congress, reports of naval\r\ncommanders, statements made on the floor of Congress, the testimony of\r\neye-witnesses, and the complaints of home and foreign anti-slavery\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n\"When I was young,\" writes Mr. Fowler of Connecticut, \"the slave-trade\r\nwas still carried on, by Connecticut shipmasters and Merchant\r\nadventurers, for the supply of southern ports. This trade was carried\r\non by the consent of the Southern States, under the provisions of the\r\nFederal Constitution, until 1808, and, after that time, clandestinely.\r\nThere was a good deal of conversation on the subject, in private\r\ncircles.\" Other States were said to be even more involved than\r\nConnecticut.[69] The African Society of London estimated that, down to\r\n1816, fifteen of the sixty thousand slaves annually taken from Africa\r\nwere shipped by Americans. \"Notwithstanding the prohibitory act of\r\nAmerica, which was passed in 1807, ships bearing the American flag\r\ncontinued to trade for slaves until 1809, when, in consequence of a\r\ndecision in the English prize appeal courts, which rendered American\r\nslave ships liable to capture and condemnation, that flag suddenly\r\ndisappeared from the coast. Its place was almost instantaneously\r\nsupplied by the Spanish flag, which, with one or two exceptions, was now\r\nseen for the first time on the African coast, engaged in covering the\r\nslave trade. This sudden substitution of the Spanish for the American\r\nflag seemed to confirm what was established in a variety of instances by\r\nmore direct testimony, that the slave trade, which now, for the first\r\ntime, assumed a Spanish dress, was in reality only the trade of other\r\nnations in disguise.\"[70]\r\n\r\nSo notorious did the participation of Americans in the traffic become,\r\nthat President Madison informed Congress in his message, December 5,\r\n1810, that \"it appears that American citizens are instrumental in\r\ncarrying on a traffic in enslaved Africans, equally in violation of the\r\nlaws of humanity, and in defiance of those of their own country. The\r\nsame just and benevolent motives which produced the interdiction in\r\nforce against this criminal conduct, will doubtless be felt by Congress,\r\nin devising further means of suppressing the evil.\"[71] The Secretary of\r\nthe Navy wrote the same year to Charleston, South Carolina: \"I hear, not\r\nwithout great concern, that the law prohibiting the importation of\r\nslaves has been violated in frequent instances, near St. Mary's.\"[72]\r\nTestimony as to violations of the law and suggestions for improving it\r\nalso came in from district attorneys.[73]\r\n\r\nThe method of introducing Negroes was simple. A slave smuggler says:\r\n\"After resting a few days at St. Augustine, ... I agreed to accompany\r\nDiego on a land trip through the United States, where a _kaffle_ of\r\nnegroes was to precede us, for whose disposal the shrewd Portuguese had\r\nalready made arrangements with my uncle's consignees. I soon learned how\r\nreadily, and at what profits, the Florida negroes were sold into the\r\nneighboring American States. The _kaffle_, under charge of negro\r\ndrivers, was to strike up the Escambia River, and thence cross the\r\nboundary into Georgia, where some of our wild Africans were mixed with\r\nvarious squads of native blacks, and driven inland, till sold off,\r\nsingly or by couples, on the road. At this period [1812], the United\r\nStates had declared the African slave trade illegal, and passed\r\nstringent laws to prevent the importation of negroes; yet the Spanish\r\npossessions were thriving on this inland exchange of negroes and\r\nmulattoes; Florida was a sort of nursery for slave-breeders, and many\r\nAmerican citizens grew rich by trafficking in Guinea negroes, and\r\nsmuggling them continually, in small parties, through the southern\r\nUnited States. At the time I mention, the business was a lively one,\r\nowing to the war then going on between the States and England, and the\r\nunsettled condition of affairs on the border.\"[74]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish flag continued to cover American slave-traders. The rapid\r\nrise of privateering during the war was not caused solely by patriotic\r\nmotives; for many armed ships fitted out in the United States obtained a\r\nthin Spanish disguise at Havana, and transported thousands of slaves to\r\nBrazil and the West Indies. Sometimes all disguise was thrown aside, and\r\nthe American flag appeared on the slave coast, as in the cases of the\r\n\"Paz,\"[75] the \"Rebecca,\" the \"Rosa\"[76] (formerly the privateer\r\n\"Commodore Perry\"), the \"Dorset\" of Baltimore,[77] and the \"Saucy\r\nJack.\"[78] Governor McCarthy of Sierra Leone wrote, in 1817: \"The slave\r\ntrade is carried on most vigorously by the Spaniards, Portuguese,\r\nAmericans and French. I have had it affirmed from several quarters, and\r\ndo believe it to be a fact, that there is a greater number of vessels\r\nemployed in that traffic than at any former period.\"[79]\r\n\r\n\r\n62. ~Apathy of the Federal Government.~ The United States cruisers\r\nsucceeded now and then in capturing a slaver, like the \"Eugene,\" which\r\nwas taken when within four miles of the New Orleans bar.[80] President\r\nMadison again, in 1816, urged Congress to act on account of the\r\n\"violations and evasions which, it is suggested, are chargeable on\r\nunworthy citizens, who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flags,\r\nand with foreign ports; and by collusive importations of slaves into the\r\nUnited States, through adjoining ports and territories.\"[81] The\r\nexecutive was continually in receipt of ample evidence of this illicit\r\ntrade and of the helplessness of officers of the law. In 1817 it was\r\nreported to the Secretary of the Navy that most of the goods carried to\r\nGalveston were brought into the United States; \"the more valuable, and\r\nthe slaves are smuggled in through the numerous inlets to the westward,\r\nwhere the people are but too much disposed to render them every possible\r\nassistance. Several hundred slaves are now at Galveston, and persons\r\nhave gone from New-Orleans to purchase them. Every exertion will be\r\nmade to intercept them, but I have little hopes of success.\"[82] Similar\r\nletters from naval officers and collectors showed that a system of slave\r\npiracy had arisen since the war, and that at Galveston there was an\r\nestablishment of organized brigands, who did not go to the trouble of\r\nsailing to Africa for their slaves, but simply captured slavers and sold\r\ntheir cargoes into the United States. This Galveston nest had, in 1817,\r\neleven armed vessels to prosecute the work, and \"the most shameful\r\nviolations of the slave act, as well as our revenue laws, continue to be\r\npractised.\"[83] Cargoes of as many as three hundred slaves were arriving\r\nin Texas. All this took place under Aury, the buccaneer governor; and\r\nwhen he removed to Amelia Island in 1817 with the McGregor raid, the\r\nillicit traffic in slaves, which had been going on there for years,[84]\r\ntook an impulse that brought it even to the somewhat deaf ears of\r\nCollector Bullock. He reported, May 22, 1817: \"I have just received\r\ninformation from a source on which I can implicitly rely, that it has\r\nalready become the practice to introduce into the state of Georgia,\r\nacross the St. Mary's River, from Amelia Island, East Florida, Africans,\r\nwho have been carried into the Port of Fernandina, subsequent to the\r\ncapture of it by the Patriot army now in possession of it ...; were the\r\nlegislature to pass an act giving compensation in some manner to\r\ninformers, it would have a tendency in a great degree to prevent the\r\npractice; as the thing now is, no citizen will take the trouble of\r\nsearching for and detecting the slaves. I further understand, that the\r\nevil will not be confined altogether to Africans, but will be extended\r\nto the worst class of West India slaves.\"[85]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the injury done by these pirates to the regular\r\nslave-trading interests was largely instrumental in exterminating them.\r\nLate in 1817 United States troops seized Amelia Island, and President\r\nMonroe felicitated Congress and the country upon escaping the \"annoyance\r\nand injury\" of this illicit trade.[86] The trade, however, seems to have\r\ncontinued, as is shown by such letters as the following, written three\r\nand a half months later:--\r\n\r\n    PORT OF DARIEN, March 14, 1818.\r\n\r\n    ... It is a painful duty, sir, to express to you, that I am in\r\n    possession of undoubted information, that African and West India\r\n    negroes are almost daily illicitly introduced into Georgia, for\r\n    sale or settlement, or passing through it to the territories of\r\n    the United States for similar purposes; these facts are\r\n    notorious; and it is not unusual to see such negroes in the\r\n    streets of St. Mary's, and such too, recently captured by our\r\n    vessels of war, and ordered to Savannah, were illegally bartered\r\n    by hundreds in that city, _for_ this bartering or bonding (as\r\n    _it is called_, but in reality _selling_,) actually took place\r\n    before any decision had [been] passed by the court respecting\r\n    them. I cannot but again express to you, sir, that these\r\n    irregularities and mocking of the laws, by men who understand\r\n    them, and who, it was presumed, would have respected them, are\r\n    such, that it requires the immediate interposition of Congress\r\n    to effect a suppression of this traffic; for, as things are,\r\n    should a faithful officer of the government apprehend such\r\n    negroes, to avoid the penalties imposed by the laws, the\r\n    proprietors disclaim them, and some agent of the executive\r\n    demands a delivery of the same to him, who may employ them as he\r\n    pleases, or effect a sale by way of a bond, for the restoration\r\n    of the negroes when legally called on so to do; which bond, it\r\n    is _understood_, is to be _forfeited_, as the amount of the bond\r\n    is so much less than the value of the property.... There are\r\n    many negroes ... recently introduced into this state and the\r\n    Alabama territory, and which can be apprehended. The undertaking\r\n    would be great; but to be sensible that we shall possess your\r\n    approbation, and that we are carrying the views and wishes of\r\n    the government into execution, is all we wish, and it shall be\r\n    done, independent of every personal consideration.\r\n\r\n    I have, etc.[87]\r\n\r\nThis \"approbation\" failed to come to the zealous collector, and on the\r\n5th of July he wrote that, \"not being favored with a reply,\" he has been\r\nobliged to deliver over to the governor's agents ninety-one illegally\r\nimported Negroes.[88] Reports from other districts corroborate this\r\ntestimony. The collector at Mobile writes of strange proceedings on the\r\npart of the courts.[89] General D.B. Mitchell, ex-governor of Georgia\r\nand United States Indian agent, after an investigation in 1821 by\r\nAttorney-General Wirt, was found \"guilty of having prostituted his\r\npower, as agent for Indian affairs at the Creek agency, to the purpose\r\nof aiding and assisting in a conscious breach of the act of Congress of\r\n1807, in prohibition of the slave trade--and this from mercenary\r\nmotives.\"[90] The indefatigable Collector Chew of New Orleans wrote to\r\nWashington that, \"to put a stop to that traffic, a naval force suitable\r\nto those waters is indispensable,\" and that \"vast numbers of slaves will\r\nbe introduced to an alarming extent, unless prompt and effectual\r\nmeasures are adopted by the general government.\"[91] Other collectors\r\ncontinually reported infractions, complaining that they could get no\r\nassistance from the citizens,[92] or plaintively asking the services of\r\n\"one small cutter.\"[93]\r\n\r\nMeantime, what was the response of the government to such\r\nrepresentations, and what efforts were made to enforce the act? A few\r\nunsystematic and spasmodic attempts are recorded. In 1811 some special\r\ninstructions were sent out,[94] and the President was authorized to\r\nseize Amelia Island.[95] Then came the war; and as late as November 15,\r\n1818, in spite of the complaints of collectors, we find no revenue\r\ncutter on the Gulf coast.[96] During the years 1817 and 1818[97] some\r\ncruisers went there irregularly, but they were too large to be\r\neffective; and the partial suppression of the Amelia Island pirates was\r\nall that was accomplished. On the whole, the efforts of the government\r\nlacked plan, energy, and often sincerity. Some captures of slavers were\r\nmade;[98] but, as the collector at Mobile wrote, anent certain cases,\r\n\"this was owing rather to accident, than any well-timed arrangement.\" He\r\nadds: \"from the Chandalier Islands to the Perdido river, including the\r\ncoast, and numerous other islands, we have only a small boat, with four\r\nmen and an inspector, to oppose to the whole confederacy of smugglers\r\nand pirates.\"[99]\r\n\r\nTo cap the climax, the government officials were so negligent that\r\nSecretary Crawford, in 1820, confessed to Congress that \"it appears,\r\nfrom an examination of the records of this office, that no particular\r\ninstructions have ever been given, by the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nunder the original or supplementary acts prohibiting the introduction of\r\nslaves into the United States.\"[100] Beside this inactivity, the\r\ngovernment was criminally negligent in not prosecuting and punishing\r\noffenders when captured. Urgent appeals for instruction from prosecuting\r\nattorneys were too often received in official silence; complaints as to\r\nthe violation of law by State officers went unheeded;[101] informers\r\nwere unprotected and sometimes driven from home.[102] Indeed, the most\r\nsevere comment on the whole period is the report, January 7, 1819, of\r\nthe Register of the Treasury, who, after the wholesale and open\r\nviolation of the Act of 1807, reported, in response to a request from\r\nthe House, \"that it doth not appear, from an examination of the records\r\nof this office, and particularly of the accounts (to the date of their\r\nlast settlement) of the collectors of the customs, and of the several\r\nmarshals of the United States, that any forfeitures had been incurred\r\nunder the said act.\"[103]\r\n\r\n63. ~Typical Cases.~ At this date (January 7, 1819), however, certain\r\ncases were stated to be pending, a history of which will fitly conclude\r\nthis discussion. In 1818 three American schooners sailed from the United\r\nStates to Havana; on June 2 they started back with cargoes aggregating\r\none hundred and seven slaves. The schooner \"Constitution\" was captured\r\nby one of Andrew Jackson's officers under the guns of Fort Barancas. The\r\n\"Louisa\" and \"Marino\" were captured by Lieutenant McKeever of the United\r\nStates Navy. The three vessels were duly proceeded against at Mobile,\r\nand the case began slowly to drag along. The slaves, instead of being\r\nput under the care of the zealous marshal of the district, were placed\r\nin the hands of three bondsmen, friends of the judge. The marshal\r\nnotified the government of this irregularity, but apparently received no\r\nanswer. In 1822 the three vessels were condemned as forfeited, but the\r\ncourt \"reserved\" for future order the distribution of the slaves.\r\nNothing whatever either then or later was done to the slave-traders\r\nthemselves. The owners of the ships promptly appealed to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, and that tribunal, in 1824, condemned the\r\nthree vessels and the slaves on two of them.[104] These slaves,\r\nconsiderably reduced in number \"from various causes,\" were sold at\r\nauction for the benefit of the State, in spite of the Act of 1819.\r\nMeantime, before the decision of the Supreme Court, the judge of the\r\nSupreme Court of West Florida had awarded to certain alleged Spanish\r\nclaimants of the slaves indemnity for nearly the whole number seized, at\r\nthe price of $650 per head, and the Secretary of the Treasury had\r\nactually paid the claim.[105] In 1826 Lieutenant McKeever urgently\r\npetitions Congress for his prize-money of $4,415.15, which he has not\r\nyet received.[106] The \"Constitution\" was for some inexplicable reason\r\nreleased from bond, and the whole case fades in a very thick cloud of\r\nofficial mist. In 1831 Congress sought to inquire into the final\r\ndisposition of the slaves. The information given was never printed; but\r\nas late as 1836 a certain Calvin Mickle petitions Congress for\r\nreimbursement for the slaves sold, for their hire, for their natural\r\nincrease, for expenses incurred, and for damages.[107]\r\n\r\n\r\n64. ~The Supplementary Acts, 1818-1820.~ To remedy the obvious defects\r\nof the Act of 1807 two courses were possible: one, to minimize the crime\r\nof transportation, and, by encouraging informers, to concentrate efforts\r\nagainst the buying of smuggled slaves; the other, to make the crime of\r\ntransportation so great that no slaves would be imported. The Act of\r\n1818 tried the first method; that of 1819, the second.[108] The latter\r\nwas obviously the more upright and logical, and the only method\r\ndeserving thought even in 1807; but the Act of 1818 was the natural\r\ndescendant of that series of compromises which began in the\r\nConstitutional Convention, and which, instead of postponing the\r\nsettlement of critical questions to more favorable times, rather\r\naggravated and complicated them.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the Act of 1818 was the Amelia Island\r\nscandal.[109] Committees in both Houses reported bills, but that of the\r\nSenate finally passed. There does not appear to have been very much\r\ndebate.[110] The sale of Africans for the benefit of the informer and of\r\nthe United States was strongly urged \"as the only means of executing the\r\nlaws against the slave trade as experience had fully demonstrated since\r\nthe origin of the prohibition.\"[111] This proposition was naturally\r\nopposed as \"inconsistent with the principles of our Government, and\r\ncalculated to throw as wide open the door to the importation of slaves\r\nas it was before the existing prohibition.\"[112] The act, which became a\r\nlaw April 20, 1818,[113] was a poorly constructed compromise, which\r\nvirtually acknowledged the failure of efforts to control the trade, and\r\nsought to remedy defects by pitting cupidity against cupidity, informer\r\nagainst thief. One-half of all forfeitures and fines were to go to the\r\ninformer, and penalties for violation were changed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    For equipping a slaver, instead of a fine of $20,000, a fine of\r\n    $1000 to $5000 and imprisonment from 3 to 7 years.\r\n\r\n    For transporting Negroes, instead of a fine of $5000 and\r\n    forfeiture of ship and Negroes, a fine of $1000 to $5000 and\r\n    imprisonment from 3 to 7 years.\r\n\r\n    For actual importation, instead of a fine of $1000 to $10,000\r\n    and imprisonment from 5 to 10 years, a fine of $1000 to\r\n    $10,000, and imprisonment from 3 to 7 years.\r\n\r\n    For knowingly buying illegally imported Negroes, instead of a\r\n    fine of $800 for each Negro and forfeiture, a fine of $1000 for\r\n    each Negro.\r\n\r\nThe burden of proof was laid on the defendant, to the extent that he\r\nmust prove that the slave in question had been imported at least five\r\nyears before the prosecution. The slaves were still left to the disposal\r\nof the States.\r\n\r\nThis statute was, of course, a failure from the start,[114] and at the\r\nvery next session Congress took steps to revise it. A bill was reported\r\nin the House, January 13, 1819, but it was not discussed till\r\nMarch.[115] It finally passed, after \"much debate.\"[116] The Senate\r\ndropped its own bill, and, after striking out the provision for the\r\ndeath penalty, passed the bill as it came from the House.[117] The House\r\nacquiesced, and the bill became a law, March 3, 1819,[118] in the midst\r\nof the Missouri trouble. This act directed the President to use armed\r\ncruisers on the coasts of the United States and Africa to suppress the\r\nslave-trade; one-half the proceeds of the condemned ship were to go to\r\nthe captors as bounty, provided the Africans were safely lodged with a\r\nUnited States marshal and the crew with the civil authorities. These\r\nprovisions were seriously marred by a proviso which Butler of Louisiana,\r\nhad inserted, with a \"due regard for the interests of the State which he\r\nrepresented,\" viz., that a captured slaver must always be returned to\r\nthe port whence she sailed.[119] This, of course, secured decided\r\nadvantages to Southern slave-traders. The most radical provision of the\r\nact was that which directed the President to \"make such regulations and\r\narrangements as he may deem expedient for the safe keeping, support, and\r\nremoval beyond the limits of the United States, of all such negroes,\r\nmulattoes, or persons of colour, as may be so delivered and brought\r\nwithin their jurisdiction;\" and to appoint an agent in Africa to receive\r\nsuch Negroes.[120] Finally, an appropriation of $100,000 was made to\r\nenforce the act.[121] This act was in some measure due to the new\r\ncolonization movement; and the return of Africans recaptured was a\r\ndistinct recognition of its efforts, and the real foundation of Liberia.\r\n\r\nTo render this straightforward act effective, it was necessary to add\r\nbut one measure, and that was a penalty commensurate with the crime of\r\nslave stealing. This was accomplished by the Act of May 15, 1820,[122] a\r\nlaw which may be regarded as the last of the Missouri Compromise\r\nmeasures. The act originated from the various bills on piracy which were\r\nintroduced early in the sixteenth Congress. The House bill, in spite of\r\nopposition, was amended so as to include slave-trading under piracy,\r\nand passed. The Senate agreed without a division. This law provided that\r\ndirect participation in the slave-trade should be piracy, punishable\r\nwith death.[123]\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------\r\n  STATUTES AT LARGE.    |        DATE.         |  AMOUNT APPROPRIATED.\r\n  ----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------\r\n     VOL.

Kendall's Report: _Senate Doc._, 21 Cong. 2 sess. I. No. 1, pp.\r\n211-8; _Amer. State Papers, Naval_, III. No. 429 E.; also Reports of\r\nthe Secretaries of the Navy from 1819 to 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n65. ~Enforcement of the Supplementary Acts, 1818-1825.~ A somewhat more\r\nsincere and determined effort to enforce the slave-trade laws now\r\nfollowed; and yet it is a significant fact that not until Lincoln's\r\nadministration did a slave-trader suffer death for violating the laws of\r\nthe United States. The participation of Americans in the trade\r\ncontinued, declining somewhat between 1825 and 1830, and then reviving,\r\nuntil it reached its highest activity between 1840 and 1860. The\r\ndevelopment of a vast internal slave-trade, and the consequent rise in\r\nthe South of vested interests strongly opposed to slave smuggling, led\r\nto a falling off in the illicit introduction of Negroes after 1825,\r\nuntil the fifties; nevertheless, smuggling never entirely ceased, and\r\nlarge numbers were thus added to the plantations of the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nMonroe had various constitutional scruples as to the execution of the\r\nAct of 1819;[124] but, as Congress took no action, he at last put a fair\r\ninterpretation on his powers, and appointed Samuel Bacon as an agent in\r\nAfrica to form a settlement for recaptured Africans. Gradually the\r\nagency thus formed became merged with that of the Colonization Society\r\non Cape Mesurado; and from this union Liberia was finally evolved.[125]\r\n\r\nMeantime, during the years 1818 to 1820, the activity of the\r\nslave-traders was prodigious. General James Tallmadge declared in the\r\nHouse, February 15, 1819: \"Our laws are already highly penal against\r\ntheir introduction, and yet, it is a well known fact, that about\r\nfourteen thousand slaves have been brought into our country this last\r\nyear.\"[126] In the same year Middleton of South Carolina and Wright of\r\nVirginia estimated illicit introduction at 13,000 and 15,000\r\nrespectively.[127] Judge Story, in charging a jury, took occasion to\r\nsay: \"We have but too many proofs from unquestionable sources, that it\r\n[the slave-trade] is still carried on with all the implacable rapacity\r\nof former times. Avarice has grown more subtle in its evasions, and\r\nwatches and seizes its prey with an appetite quickened rather than\r\nsuppressed by its guilty vigils. American citizens are steeped to their\r\nvery mouths (I can hardly use too bold a figure) in this stream of\r\niniquity.\"[128] The following year, 1820, brought some significant\r\nstatements from various members of Congress. Said Smith of South\r\nCarolina: \"Pharaoh was, for his temerity, drowned in the Red Sea, in\r\npursuing them [the Israelites] contrary to God's express will; but our\r\nNorthern friends have not been afraid even of that, in their zeal to\r\nfurnish the Southern States with Africans. They are better seamen than\r\nPharaoh, and calculate by that means to elude the vigilance of Heaven;\r\nwhich they seem to disregard, if they can but elude the violated laws of\r\ntheir country.\"[129] As late as May he saw little hope of suppressing\r\nthe traffic.[130] Sergeant of Pennsylvania declared: \"It is notorious\r\nthat, in spite of the utmost vigilance that can be employed, African\r\nnegroes are clandestinely brought in and sold as slaves.\"[131] Plumer of\r\nNew Hampshire stated that \"of the unhappy beings, thus in violation of\r\nall laws transported to our shores, and thrown by force into the mass of\r\nour black population, scarcely one in a hundred is ever detected by the\r\nofficers of the General Government, in a part of the country, where, if\r\nwe are to believe the statement of Governor Rabun, 'an officer who would\r\nperform his duty, by attempting to enforce the law [against the slave\r\ntrade] is, by many, considered as an officious meddler, and treated with\r\nderision and contempt;' ... I have been told by a gentleman, who has\r\nattended particularly to this subject, that ten thousand slaves were in\r\none year smuggled into the United States; and that, even for the last\r\nyear, we must count the number not by hundreds, but by thousands.\"[132]\r\nIn 1821 a committee of Congress characterized prevailing methods as\r\nthose \"of the grossest fraud that could be practised to deceive the\r\nofficers of government.\"[133] Another committee, in 1822, after a\r\ncareful examination of the subject, declare that they \"find it\r\nimpossible to measure with precision the effect produced upon the\r\nAmerican branch of the slave trade by the laws above mentioned, and the\r\nseizures under them. They are unable to state, whether those American\r\nmerchants, the American capital and seamen which heretofore aided in\r\nthis traffic, have abandoned it altogether, or have sought shelter under\r\nthe flags of other nations.\" They then state the suspicious circumstance\r\nthat, with the disappearance of the American flag from the traffic, \"the\r\ntrade, notwithstanding, increases annually, under the flags of other\r\nnations.\" They complain of the spasmodic efforts of the executive. They\r\nsay that the first United States cruiser arrived on the African coast in\r\nMarch, 1820, and remained a \"few weeks;\" that since then four others had\r\nin two years made five visits in all; but \"since the middle of last\r\nNovember, the commencement of the healthy season on that coast, no\r\nvessel has been, nor, as your committee is informed, is, under orders\r\nfor that service.\"[134] The United States African agent, Ayres, reported\r\nin 1823: \"I was informed by an American officer who had been on the\r\ncoast in 1820, that he had boarded 20 American vessels in one morning,\r\nlying in the port of Gallinas, and fitted for the reception of slaves.\r\nIt is a lamentable fact, that most of the harbours, between the Senegal\r\nand the line, were visited by an equal number of American vessels, and\r\nfor the sole purpose of carrying away slaves. Although for some years\r\nthe coast had been occasionally visited by our cruizers, their short\r\nstay and seldom appearance had made but slight impression on those\r\ntraders, rendered hardy by repetition of crime, and avaricious by\r\nexcessive gain. They were enabled by a regular system to gain\r\nintelligence of any cruizer being on the coast.\"[135]\r\n\r\nEven such spasmodic efforts bore abundant fruit, and indicated what\r\nvigorous measures might have accomplished. Between May, 1818, and\r\nNovember, 1821, nearly six hundred Africans were recaptured and eleven\r\nAmerican slavers taken.[136] Such measures gradually changed the\r\ncharacter of the trade, and opened the international phase of the\r\nquestion. American slavers cleared for foreign ports, there took a\r\nforeign flag and papers, and then sailed boldly past American cruisers,\r\nalthough their real character was often well known. More stringent\r\nclearance laws and consular instructions might have greatly reduced this\r\npractice; but nothing was ever done, and gradually the laws became in\r\nlarge measure powerless to deal with the bulk of the illicit trade. In\r\n1820, September 16, a British officer, in his official report, declares\r\nthat, in spite of United States laws, \"American vessels, American\r\nsubjects, and American capital, are unquestionably engaged in the trade,\r\nthough under other colours and in disguise.\"[137] The United States ship\r\n\"Cyane\" at one time reported ten captures within a few days, adding:\r\n\"Although they are evidently owned by Americans, they are so completely\r\ncovered by Spanish papers that it is impossible to condemn them.\"[138]\r\nThe governor of Sierra Leone reported the rivers Nunez and Pongas full\r\nof renegade European and American slave-traders;[139] the trade was said\r\nto be carried on \"to an extent that almost staggers belief.\"[140] Down\r\nto 1824 or 1825, reports from all quarters prove this activity in\r\nslave-trading.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the laws within the country exhibits grave defects and\r\neven criminal negligence. Attorney-General Wirt finds it necessary to\r\nassure collectors, in 1819, that \"it is against public policy to\r\ndispense with prosecutions for violation of the law to prohibit the\r\nSlave trade.\"[141] One district attorney writes: \"It appears to be\r\nalmost impossible to enforce the laws of the United States against\r\noffenders after the negroes have been landed in the state.\"[142] Again,\r\nit is asserted that \"when vessels engaged in the slave trade have been\r\ndetained by the American cruizers, and sent into the slave-holding\r\nstates, there appears at once a difficulty in securing the freedom to\r\nthese captives which the laws of the United States have decreed for\r\nthem.\"[143] In some cases, one man would smuggle in the Africans and\r\nhide them in the woods; then his partner would \"rob\" him, and so all\r\ntrace be lost.[144] Perhaps 350 Africans were officially reported as\r\nbrought in contrary to law from 1818 to 1820: the absurdity of this\r\nfigure is apparent.[145] A circular letter to the marshals, in 1821,\r\nbrought reports of only a few well-known cases, like that of the\r\n\"General Ramirez;\" the marshal of Louisiana had \"no information.\"[146]\r\n\r\nThere appears to be little positive evidence of a large illicit\r\nimportation into the country for a decade after 1825. It is hardly\r\npossible, however, considering the activity in the trade, that slaves\r\nwere not largely imported. Indeed, when we note how the laws were\r\ncontinually broken in other respects, absence of evidence of petty\r\nsmuggling becomes presumptive evidence that collusive or tacit\r\nunderstanding of officers and citizens allowed the trade to some\r\nextent.[147] Finally, it must be noted that during all this time\r\nscarcely a man suffered for participating in the trade, beyond the loss\r\nof the Africans and, more rarely, of his ship. Red-handed slavers,\r\ncaught in the act and convicted, were too often, like La Coste of South\r\nCarolina, the subjects of executive clemency.[148] In certain cases\r\nthere were those who even had the effrontery to ask Congress to cancel\r\ntheir own laws. For instance, in 1819 a Venezuelan privateer, secretly\r\nfitted out and manned by Americans in Baltimore, succeeded in capturing\r\nseveral American, Portuguese, and Spanish slavers, and appropriating the\r\nslaves; being finally wrecked herself, she transferred her crew and\r\nslaves to one of her prizes, the \"Antelope,\" which was eventually\r\ncaptured by a United States cruiser and the 280 Africans sent to\r\nGeorgia. After much litigation, the United States Supreme Court ordered\r\nthose captured from Spaniards to be surrendered, and the others to be\r\nreturned to Africa. By some mysterious process, only 139 Africans now\r\nremained, 100 of whom were sent to Africa. The Spanish claimants of the\r\nremaining thirty-nine sold them to a certain Mr. Wilde, who gave bond to\r\ntransport them out of the country. Finally, in December, 1827, there\r\ncame an innocent petition to Congress to _cancel this bond_.[149] A bill\r\nto that effect passed and was approved, May 2, 1828,[150] and in\r\nconsequence these Africans remained as slaves in Georgia.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it is plain that, although in the period from 1807 to 1820\r\nCongress laid down broad lines of legislation sufficient, save in some\r\ndetails, to suppress the African slave trade to America, yet the\r\nexecution of these laws was criminally lax. Moreover, by the facility\r\nwith which slavers could disguise their identity, it was possible for\r\nthem to escape even a vigorous enforcement of our laws. This situation\r\ncould properly be met only by energetic and sincere international\r\nco-operation. The next chapter will review efforts directed toward this\r\nend.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] _House Journal_ (repr. 1826), 9 Cong. 2 sess.

It was eventually captured by H.M.S.\r\n      \"Bann,\" after a hard fight.\r\n\r\n [77] Also called Spanish schooner \"Triumvirate,\" with American\r\n      supercargo, Spanish captain, and American, French, Spanish,\r\n      and English crew.

The Spanish claimants were, it was alleged with\r\n      much probability, but representatives of Americans. The claim\r\n      was paid under the provisions of the Treaty of Florida, and\r\n      included slaves whom the court afterward declared forfeited.\r\n\r\n[106] An act to relieve him was finally passed, Feb. 8, 1827,\r\n      nine years after the capture. See _Statutes at Large_, VI.\r\n      357.\r\n\r\n[107] It is difficult to get at the exact facts in this\r\n      complicated case. The above statement is, I think, much milder\r\n      than the real facts would warrant, if thoroughly known. Cf.\r\n      _House Reports_, 19 Cong. 1 sess. II. No. 231; 21 Cong. 1\r\n      sess.

No. 308.\r\n\r\n[108] The first method, represented by the Act of 1818, was\r\n      favored by the South, the Senate, and the Democrats; the\r\n      second method, represented by the Act of 1819, by the North,\r\n      the House, and by the as yet undeveloped but growing Whig\r\n      party.\r\n\r\n[109] Committees on the slave-trade were appointed by the\r\n      House in 1810 and 1813; the committee of 1813 recommended a\r\n      revision of the laws, but nothing was done: _Annals of Cong._,\r\n      11 Cong. 3 sess. p. 387; 12 Cong. 2 sess. pp. 1074, 1090. The\r\n      presidential message of 1816 led to committees on the trade in\r\n      both Houses. The committee of the House of Representatives\r\n      reported a joint resolution on abolishing the traffic and\r\n      colonizing the Negroes, also looking toward international\r\n      action. This never came to a vote: _Senate Journal_, 14 Cong.\r\n      2 sess. pp. 46, 179, 180; _House Journal_, 14 Cong. 2 sess.\r\n      pp. 25, 27, 380; _House Doc_, 14 Cong. 2 sess. II. No. 77.\r\n      Finally, the presidential message of 1817 (_House Journal_, 15\r\n      Cong. 1 sess. p. 11), announcing the issuance of orders to\r\n      suppress the Amelia Island establishment, led to two other\r\n      committees in both Houses. The House committee under Middleton\r\n      made a report with a bill (_Amer. State Papers,\r\n      Miscellaneous_, II.

Strother opposed, \"for various\r\n      reasons of expediency,\" the bounties for captors. Nelson of\r\n      Virginia advocated the death penalty, and, aided by Pindall,\r\n      had it inserted. The vote on the bill was 57 to 45.\r\n\r\n[117] The Senate had also had a committee at work on a bill\r\n      which was reported Feb. 8, and finally postponed: _Senate\r\n      Journal_, 15 Cong. 2 sess. pp. 234, 244, 311-2, 347.

In the House there was a bill on piracy, and\r\n      a slave-trade committee reported recommending that the\r\n      slave-trade be piracy. The Senate bill and this bill were\r\n      considered in Committee of the Whole, May 11, and a bill was\r\n      finally passed declaring, among other things, the traffic\r\n      piracy. In the Senate there was \"some discussion, rather on\r\n      the form than the substance of these amendments,\" and \"they\r\n      were agreed to without a division\": _Senate Journal_, 16 Cong.\r\n      1 sess. pp. 238, 241, 268, 287, 314, 331, 346, 350, 409, 412,\r\n      417, 420, 422, 424, 425; _House Journal_, 16 Cong. 1 sess. pp.\r\n      113, 280, 453, 454, 494, 518, 520, 522, 537; _Annals of\r\n      Cong._, 16 Cong. 1 sess. pp. 693-4, 2231, 2236-7, etc. The\r\n      debates were not reported.\r\n\r\n[123] _Statutes at Large_, III. 600-1. This act was in reality\r\n      a continuation of the piracy Act of 1819, and was only\r\n      temporary.

In 1792, by royal order,\r\nthis traffic was prohibited in the Danish possessions after 1802. The\r\nprinciples of the French Revolution logically called for the extinction\r\nof the slave system by France. This was, however, accomplished more\r\nprecipitately than the Convention anticipated; and in a whirl of\r\nenthusiasm engendered by the appearance of the Dominican deputies,\r\nslavery and the slave-trade were abolished in all French colonies\r\nFebruary 4, 1794.[2] This abolition was short-lived; for at the command\r\nof the First Consul slavery and the slave-trade was restored in An X\r\n(1799).[3] The trade was finally abolished by Napoleon during the\r\nHundred Days by a decree, March 29, 1815, which briefly declared: \"À\r\ndater de la publication du présent Décret, la Traite des Noirs est\r\nabolie.\"[4] The Treaty of Paris eventually confirmed this law.[5]\r\n\r\nIn England, the united efforts of Sharpe, Clarkson, and Wilberforce\r\nearly began to arouse public opinion by means of agitation and pamphlet\r\nliterature. May 21, 1788, Sir William Dolben moved a bill regulating the\r\ntrade, which passed in July and was the last English measure\r\ncountenancing the traffic.[6] The report of the Privy Council on the\r\nsubject in 1789[7] precipitated the long struggle. On motion of Pitt, in\r\n1788, the House had resolved to take up at the next session the question\r\nof the abolition of the trade.[8] It was, accordingly, called up by\r\nWilberforce, and a remarkable parliamentary battle ensued, which lasted\r\ncontinuously until 1805. The Grenville-Fox ministry now espoused the\r\ncause. This ministry first prohibited the trade with such colonies as\r\nEngland had acquired by conquest during the Napoleonic wars; then, in\r\n1806, they prohibited the foreign slave-trade; and finally, March 25,\r\n1807, enacted the total abolition of the traffic.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n67. ~Concerted Action of the Powers, 1783-1814.~ During the peace\r\nnegotiations between the United States and Great Britain in 1783, it was\r\nproposed by Jay, in June, that there be a proviso inserted as follows:\r\n\"Provided that the subjects of his Britannic Majesty shall not have any\r\nright or claim under the convention, to carry or import, into the said\r\nStates any slaves from any part of the world; it being the intention of\r\nthe said States entirely to prohibit the importation thereof.\"[10] Fox\r\npromptly replied: \"If that be their policy, it never can be competent to\r\nus to dispute with them their own regulations.\"[11] No mention of this\r\nwas, however, made in the final treaty, probably because it was thought\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed treaty of 1806, signed at London December 31, Article 24\r\nprovided that \"The high contracting parties engage to communicate to\r\neach other, without delay, all such laws as have been or shall be\r\nhereafter enacted by their respective Legislatures, as also all measures\r\nwhich shall have been taken for the abolition or limitation of the\r\nAfrican slave trade; and they further agree to use their best endeavors\r\nto procure the co-operation of other Powers for the final and complete\r\nabolition of a trade so repugnant to the principles of justice and\r\nhumanity.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThis marks the beginning of a long series of treaties between England\r\nand other powers looking toward the prohibition of the traffic by\r\ninternational agreement. During the years 1810-1814 she signed treaties\r\nrelating to the subject with Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden.[13] May 30,\r\n1814, an additional article to the Treaty of Paris, between France and\r\nGreat Britain, engaged these powers to endeavor to induce the\r\napproaching Congress at Vienna \"to decree the abolition of the Slave\r\nTrade, so that the said Trade shall cease universally, as it shall cease\r\ndefinitively, under any circumstances, on the part of the French\r\nGovernment, in the course of 5 years; and that during the said period no\r\nSlave Merchant shall import or sell Slaves, except in the Colonies of\r\nthe State of which he is a Subject.\"[14] In addition to this, the next\r\nday a circular letter was despatched by Castlereagh to Austria, Russia,\r\nand Prussia, expressing the hope \"that the Powers of Europe, when\r\nrestoring Peace to Europe, with one common interest, will crown this\r\ngreat work by interposing their benign offices in favour of those\r\nRegions of the Globe, which yet continue to be desolated by this\r\nunnatural and inhuman traffic.\"[15] Meantime additional treaties were\r\nsecured: in 1814 by royal decree Netherlands agreed to abolish the\r\ntrade;[16] Spain was induced by her necessities to restrain her trade to\r\nher own colonies, and to endeavor to prevent the fraudulent use of her\r\nflag by foreigners;[17] and in 1815 Portugal agreed to abolish the\r\nslave-trade north of the equator.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n68. ~Action of the Powers from 1814 to 1820.~ At the Congress of Vienna,\r\nwhich assembled late in 1814, Castlereagh was indefatigable in his\r\nendeavors to secure the abolition of the trade. France and Spain,\r\nhowever, refused to yield farther than they had already done, and the\r\nother powers hesitated to go to the lengths he recommended.\r\nNevertheless, he secured the institution of annual conferences on the\r\nmatter, and a declaration by the Congress strongly condemning the trade\r\nand declaring that \"the public voice in all civilized countries was\r\nraised to demand its suppression as soon as possible,\" and that, while\r\nthe definitive period of termination would be left to subsequent\r\nnegotiation, the sovereigns would not consider their work done until the\r\ntrade was entirely suppressed.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the Treaty of Ghent, between Great Britain and the United States,\r\nratified February 17, 1815, Article 10, proposed by Great Britain,\r\ndeclared that, \"Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the\r\nprinciples of humanity and justice,\" the two countries agreed to use\r\ntheir best endeavors in abolishing the trade.[20] The final overthrow of\r\nNapoleon was marked by a second declaration of the powers, who,\r\n\"desiring to give effect to the measures on which they deliberated at\r\nthe Congress of Vienna, relative to the complete and universal\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, and having, each in their respective\r\nDominions, prohibited without restriction their Colonies and Subjects\r\nfrom taking any part whatever in this Traffic, engage to renew\r\nconjointly their efforts, with the view of securing final success to\r\nthose principles which they proclaimed in the Declaration of the 4th\r\nFebruary, 1815, and of concerting, without loss of time, through their\r\nMinisters at the Courts of London and of Paris, the most effectual\r\nmeasures for the entire and definitive abolition of a Commerce so\r\nodious, and so strongly condemned by the laws of religion and of\r\nnature.\"[21]\r\n\r\nTreaties further restricting the trade continued to be made by Great\r\nBritain: Spain abolished the trade north of the equator in 1817,[22] and\r\npromised entire abolition in 1820; Spain, Portugal, and Holland also\r\ngranted a mutual limited Right of Search to England, and joined in\r\nestablishing mixed courts.[23] The effort, however, to secure a general\r\ndeclaration of the powers urging, if not compelling, the abolition of\r\nthe trade in 1820, as well as the attempt to secure a qualified\r\ninternational Right of Visit, failed, although both propositions were\r\nstrongly urged by England at the Conference of 1818.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n69. ~The Struggle for an International Right of Search, 1820-1840.~\r\nWhatever England's motives were, it is certain that only a limited\r\ninternational Right of Visit on the high seas could suppress or greatly\r\nlimit the slave-trade. Her diplomacy was therefore henceforth directed\r\nto this end. On the other hand, the maritime supremacy of England, so\r\nsuccessfully asserted during the Napoleonic wars, would, in case a Right\r\nof Search were granted, virtually make England the policeman of the\r\nseas; and if nations like the United States had already, under present\r\nconditions, had just cause to complain of violations by England of their\r\nrights on the seas, might not any extension of rights by international\r\nagreement be dangerous? It was such considerations that for many years\r\nbrought the powers to a dead-lock in their efforts to suppress the\r\nslave-trade.\r\n\r\nAt first it looked as if England might attempt, by judicial decisions in\r\nher own courts, to seize even foreign slavers.[25] After the war,\r\nhowever, her courts disavowed such action,[26] and the right was sought\r\nfor by treaty stipulation. Castlereagh took early opportunity to\r\napproach the United States on the matter, suggesting to Minister Rush,\r\nJune 20, 1818, a mutual but strictly limited Right of Search.[27] Rush\r\nwas ordered to give him assurances of the solicitude of the United\r\nStates to suppress the traffic, but to state that the concessions asked\r\nfor appeared of a character not adaptable to our institutions.\r\nNegotiations were then transferred to Washington; and the new British\r\nminister, Mr. Stratford Canning, approached Adams with full instructions\r\nin December, 1820.[28]\r\n\r\nMeantime, it had become clear to many in the United States that the\r\nindividual efforts of States could never suppress or even limit the\r\ntrade without systematic co-operation. In 1817 a committee of the House\r\nhad urged the opening of negotiations looking toward such international\r\nco-operation,[29] and a Senate motion to the same effect had caused long\r\ndebate.[30] In 1820 and 1821 two House committee reports, one of which\r\nrecommended the granting of a Right of Search, were adopted by the\r\nHouse, but failed in the Senate.[31] Adams, notwithstanding this, saw\r\nconstitutional objections to the plan proposed by Canning, and wrote to\r\nhim, December 30: \"A Compact, giving the power to the Naval Officers of\r\none Nation to search the Merchant Vessels of another for Offenders and\r\noffences against the Laws of the latter, backed by a further power to\r\nseize and carry into a Foreign Port, and there subject to the decision\r\nof a Tribunal composed of at least one half Foreigners, irresponsible to\r\nthe Supreme Corrective tribunal of this Union, and not amendable to the\r\ncontroul of impeachment for official misdemeanors, was an investment of\r\npower, over the persons, property and reputation of the Citizens of this\r\nCountry, not only unwarranted by any delegation of Sovereign Power to\r\nthe National Government, but so adverse to the elementary principles and\r\nindispensable securities of individual rights, ... that not even the\r\nmost unqualified approbation of the ends ... could justify the\r\ntransgression.\" He then suggested co-operation of the fleets on the\r\ncoast of Africa, a proposal which was promptly accepted.[32]\r\n\r\nThe slave-trade was again a subject of international consideration at\r\nthe Congress of Verona in 1822. Austria, France, Great Britain, Russia,\r\nand Prussia were represented. The English delegates declared that,\r\nalthough only Portugal and Brazil allowed the trade, yet the traffic was\r\nat that moment carried on to a greater extent than ever before. They\r\nsaid that in seven months of the year 1821 no less than 21,000 slaves\r\nwere abducted, and three hundred and fifty-two vessels entered African\r\nports north of the equator. \"It is obvious,\" said they, \"that this crime\r\nis committed in contravention of the Laws of every Country of Europe,\r\nand of America, excepting only of one, and that it requires something\r\nmore than the ordinary operation of Law to prevent it.\" England\r\ntherefore recommended:--\r\n\r\n1. That each country denounce the trade as piracy, with a view of\r\nfounding upon the aggregate of such separate declarations a general law\r\nto be incorporated in the Law of Nations.\r\n\r\n2. A withdrawing of the flags of the Powers from persons not natives of\r\nthese States, who engage in the traffic under the flags of these States.\r\n\r\n3. A refusal to admit to their domains the produce of the colonies of\r\nStates allowing the trade, a measure which would apply to Portugal and\r\nBrazil alone.\r\n\r\nThese proposals were not accepted. Austria would agree to the first two\r\nonly; France refused to denounce the trade as piracy; and Prussia was\r\nnon-committal. The utmost that could be gained was another denunciation\r\nof the trade couched in general terms.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\n70. ~Negotiations of 1823-1825.~ England did not, however, lose hope of\r\ngaining some concession from the United States. Another House committee\r\nhad, in 1822, reported that the only method of suppressing the trade was\r\nby granting a Right of Search.[34] The House agreed, February 28, 1823,\r\nto request the President to enter into negotiations with the maritime\r\npowers of Europe to denounce the slave-trade as piracy; an amendment\r\n\"that we agree to a qualified right of search\" was, however, lost.[35]\r\nMeantime, the English minister was continually pressing the matter upon\r\nAdams, who proposed in turn to denounce the trade as piracy. Canning\r\nagreed to this, but only on condition that it be piracy under the Law of\r\nNations and not merely by statute law. Such an agreement, he said, would\r\ninvolve a Right of Search for its enforcement; he proposed strictly to\r\nlimit and define this right, to allow captured ships to be tried in\r\ntheir own courts, and not to commit the United States in any way to the\r\nquestion of the belligerent Right of Search. Adams finally sent a draft\r\nof a proposed treaty to England, and agreed to recognize the\r\nslave-traffic \"as piracy under the law of nations, namely: that,\r\nalthough seizable by the officers and authorities of every nation, they\r\nshould be triable only by the tribunals of the country of the slave\r\ntrading vessel.\"[36]\r\n\r\nRush presented this _project_ to the government in January, 1824.\r\nEngland agreed to all the points insisted on by the United States; viz.,\r\nthat she herself should denounce the trade as piracy; that slavers\r\nshould be tried in their own country; that the captor should be laid\r\nunder the most effective responsibility for his conduct; and that\r\nvessels under convoy of a ship of war of their own country should be\r\nexempt from search. In addition, England demanded that citizens of\r\neither country captured under the flag of a third power should be sent\r\nhome for trial, and that citizens of either country chartering vessels\r\nof a third country should come under these stipulations.[37]\r\n\r\nThis convention was laid before the Senate April 30, 1824, but was not\r\nacted upon until May 21, when it was so amended as to make it terminable\r\nat six months' notice. The same day, President Monroe, \"apprehending,\r\nfrom the delay in the decision, that some difficulty exists,\" sent a\r\nspecial message to the Senate, giving at length the reasons for signing\r\nthe treaty, and saying that \"should this Convention be adopted, there is\r\nevery reason to believe, that it will be the commencement of a system\r\ndestined to accomplish the entire Abolition of the Slave Trade.\" It was,\r\nhowever, a time of great political pot-boiling, and consequently an\r\nunfortunate occasion to ask senators to settle any great question. A\r\nsystematic attack, led by Johnson of Louisiana, was made on all the\r\nvital provisions of the treaty: the waters of America were excepted from\r\nits application, and those of the West Indies barely escaped exception;\r\nthe provision which, perhaps, aimed the deadliest blow at American\r\nslave-trade interests was likewise struck out; namely, the application\r\nof the Right of Search to citizens chartering the vessels of a third\r\nnation.[38]\r\n\r\nThe convention thus mutilated was not signed by England, who demanded as\r\nthe least concession the application of the Right of Search to American\r\nwaters. Meantime the United States had invited nearly all nations to\r\ndenounce the trade as piracy; and the President, the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, and a House committee had urgently favored the granting of the\r\nRight of Search. The bad faith of Congress, however, in the matter of\r\nthe Colombian treaty broke off for a time further negotiations with\r\nEngland.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n71. ~The Attitude of the United States and the State of the\r\nSlave-Trade.~ In 1824 the Right of Search was established between\r\nEngland and Sweden, and in 1826 Brazil promised to abolish the trade in\r\nthree years.[40] In 1831 the cause was greatly advanced by the signing\r\nof a treaty between Great Britain and France, granting mutually a\r\ngeographically limited Right of Search.[41] This led, in the next few\r\nyears, to similar treaties with Denmark, Sardinia,[42] the Hanse\r\ntowns,[43] and Naples.[44] Such measures put the trade more and more in\r\nthe hands of Americans, and it began greatly to increase. Mercer sought\r\nrepeatedly in the House to have negotiations reopened with England, but\r\nwithout success.[45] Indeed, the chances of success were now for many\r\nyears imperilled by the recurrence of deliberate search of American\r\nvessels by the British.[46] In the majority of cases the vessels proved\r\nto be slavers, and some of them fraudulently flew the American flag;\r\nnevertheless, their molestation by British cruisers created much\r\nfeeling, and hindered all steps toward an understanding: the United\r\nStates was loath to have her criminal negligence in enforcing her own\r\nlaws thus exposed by foreigners. Other international questions connected\r\nwith the trade also strained the relations of the two countries: three\r\ndifferent vessels engaged in the domestic slave-trade, driven by stress\r\nof weather, or, in the \"Creole\" case, captured by Negroes on board,\r\nlanded slaves in British possessions; England freed them, and refused to\r\npay for such as were landed after emancipation had been proclaimed in\r\nthe West Indies.[47] The case of the slaver \"L'Amistad\" also raised\r\ndifficulties with Spain. This Spanish vessel, after the Negroes on board\r\nhad mutinied and killed their owners, was seized by a United States\r\nvessel and brought into port for adjudication. The court, however, freed\r\nthe Negroes, on the ground that under Spanish law they were not legally\r\nslaves; and although the Senate repeatedly tried to indemnify the\r\nowners, the project did not succeed.[48]\r\n\r\nSuch proceedings well illustrate the new tendency of the pro-slavery\r\nparty to neglect the enforcement of the slave-trade laws, in a frantic\r\ndefence of the remotest ramparts of slave property. Consequently, when,\r\nafter the treaty of 1831, France and England joined in urging the\r\naccession of the United States to it, the British minister was at last\r\ncompelled to inform Palmerston, December, 1833, that \"the Executive at\r\nWashington appears to shrink from bringing forward, in any shape, a\r\nquestion, upon which depends the completion of their former object--the\r\nutter and universal Abolition of the Slave Trade--from an apprehension\r\nof alarming the Southern States.\"[49] Great Britain now offered to sign\r\nthe proposed treaty of 1824 as amended; but even this Forsyth refused,\r\nand stated that the United States had determined not to become \"a party\r\nof any Convention on the subject of the Slave Trade.\"[50]\r\n\r\nEstimates as to the extent of the slave-trade agree that the traffic to\r\nNorth and South America in 1820 was considerable, certainly not much\r\nless than 40,000 slaves annually. From that time to about 1825 it\r\ndeclined somewhat, but afterward increased enormously, so that by 1837\r\nthe American importation was estimated as high as 200,000 Negroes\r\nannually. The total abolition of the African trade by American countries\r\nthen brought the traffic down to perhaps 30,000 in 1842. A large and\r\nrapid increase of illicit traffic followed; so that by 1847 the\r\nimportation amounted to nearly 100,000 annually. One province of Brazil\r\nis said to have received 173,000 in the years 1846-1849. In the decade\r\n1850-1860 this activity in slave-trading continued, and reached very\r\nlarge proportions.\r\n\r\nThe traffic thus carried on floated under the flags of France, Spain,\r\nand Portugal, until about 1830; from 1830 to 1840 it began gradually to\r\nassume the United States flag; by 1845, a large part of the trade was\r\nunder the stars and stripes; by 1850 fully one-half the trade, and in\r\nthe decade, 1850-1860 nearly all the traffic, found this flag its best\r\nprotection.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n72. ~The Quintuple Treaty, 1839-1842.~ In 1839 Pope Gregory XVI.\r\nstigmatized the slave-trade \"as utterly unworthy of the Christian name;\"\r\nand at the same time, although proscribed by the laws of every civilized\r\nState, the trade was flourishing with pristine vigor. Great advantage\r\nwas given the traffic by the fact that the United States, for two\r\ndecades after the abortive attempt of 1824, refused to co-operate with\r\nthe rest of the civilized world, and allowed her flag to shelter and\r\nprotect the slave-trade. If a fully equipped slaver sailed from New\r\nYork, Havana, Rio Janeiro, or Liverpool, she had only to hoist the stars\r\nand stripes in order to proceed unmolested on her piratical voyage; for\r\nthere was seldom a United States cruiser to be met with, and there were,\r\non the other hand, diplomats at Washington so jealous of the honor of\r\nthe flag that they would prostitute it to crime rather than allow an\r\nEnglish or a French cruiser in any way to interfere. Without doubt, the\r\ncontention of the United States as to England's pretensions to a Right\r\nof Visit was technically correct. Nevertheless, it was clear that if the\r\nslave-trade was to be suppressed, each nation must either zealously keep\r\nher flag from fraudulent use, or, as a labor-saving device, depute to\r\nothers this duty for limited places and under special circumstances. A\r\nfailure of any one nation to do one of these two things meant that the\r\nefforts of all other nations were to be fruitless. The United States had\r\ninvited the world to join her in denouncing the slave-trade as piracy;\r\nyet, when such a pirate was waylaid by an English vessel, the United\r\nStates complained or demanded reparation. The only answer which this\r\ncountry for years returned to the long-continued exposures of American\r\nslave-traders and of the fraudulent use of the American flag, was a\r\nrecital of cases where Great Britain had gone beyond her legal powers in\r\nher attempt to suppress the slave-trade.[52] In the face of overwhelming\r\nevidence to the contrary, Secretary of State Forsyth declared, in 1840,\r\nthat the duty of the United States in the matter of the slave-trade \"has\r\nbeen faithfully performed, and if the traffic still exists as a disgrace\r\nto humanity, it is to be imputed to nations with whom Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment has formed and maintained the most intimate connexions, and\r\nto whose Governments Great Britain has paid for the right of active\r\nintervention in order to its complete extirpation.\"[53] So zealous was\r\nStevenson, our minister to England, in denying the Right of Search, that\r\nhe boldly informed Palmerston, in 1841, \"that there is no shadow of\r\npretence for excusing, much less justifying, the exercise of any such\r\nright. That it is wholly immaterial, whether the vessels be equipped\r\nfor, or actually engaged in slave traffic or not, and consequently the\r\nright to search or detain even slave vessels, must be confined to the\r\nships or vessels of those nations with whom it may have treaties on the\r\nsubject.\"[54] Palmerston courteously replied that he could not think\r\nthat the United States seriously intended to make its flag a refuge for\r\nslave-traders;[55] and Aberdeen pertinently declared: \"Now, it can\r\nscarcely be maintained by Mr. Stevenson that Great Britain should be\r\nbound to permit her own subjects, with British vessels and British\r\ncapital, to carry on, before the eyes of British officers, this\r\ndetestable traffic in human beings, which the law has declared to be\r\npiracy, merely because they had the audacity to commit an additional\r\noffence by fraudulently usurping the American flag.\"[56] Thus the\r\ndispute, even after the advent of Webster, went on for a time, involving\r\nitself in metaphysical subtleties, and apparently leading no nearer to\r\nan understanding.[57]\r\n\r\nIn 1838 a fourth conference of the powers for the consideration of the\r\nslave-trade took place at London. It was attended by representatives of\r\nEngland, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria. England laid the _projet_\r\nof a treaty before them, to which all but France assented. This\r\nso-called Quintuple Treaty, signed December 20, 1841, denounced the\r\nslave-trade as piracy, and declared that \"the High Contracting Parties\r\nagree by common consent, that those of their ships of war which shall be\r\nprovided with special warrants and orders ... may search every\r\nmerchant-vessel belonging to any one of the High Contracting Parties\r\nwhich shall, on reasonable grounds, be suspected of being engaged in the\r\ntraffic in slaves.\" All captured slavers were to be sent to their own\r\ncountries for trial.[58]\r\n\r\nWhile the ratification of this treaty was pending, the United States\r\nminister to France, Lewis Cass, addressed an official note to Guizot at\r\nthe French foreign office, protesting against the institution of an\r\ninternational Right of Search, and rather grandiloquently warning the\r\npowers against the use of force to accomplish their ends.[59] This\r\nextraordinary epistle, issued on the minister's own responsibility,\r\nbrought a reply denying that the creation of any \"new principle of\r\ninternational law, whereby the vessels even of those powers which have\r\nnot participated in the arrangement should be subjected to the right of\r\nsearch,\" was ever intended, and affirming that no such extraordinary\r\ninterpretation could be deduced from the Convention. Moreover, M. Guizot\r\nhoped that the United States, by agreeing to this treaty, would \"aid, by\r\nits most sincere endeavors, in the definitive abolition of the\r\ntrade.\"[60] Cass's theatrical protest was, consciously or unconsciously,\r\nthe manifesto of that growing class in the United States who wanted no\r\nfurther measures taken for the suppression of the slave-trade; toward\r\nthat, as toward the institution of slavery, this party favored a policy\r\nof strict _laissez-faire_.\r\n\r\n\r\n73. ~Final Concerted Measures, 1842-1862.~ The Treaty of Washington, in\r\n1842, made the first effective compromise in the matter and broke the\r\nunpleasant dead-lock, by substituting joint cruising by English and\r\nAmerican squadrons for the proposed grant of a Right of Search. In\r\nsubmitting this treaty, Tyler said: \"The treaty which I now submit to\r\nyou proposes no alteration, mitigation, or modification of the rules of\r\nthe law of nations. It provides simply that each of the two Governments\r\nshall maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron to enforce\r\nseparately and respectively the laws, rights, and obligations of the two\r\ncountries for the suppression of the slave trade.\"[61] This provision\r\nwas a part of the treaty to settle the boundary disputes with England.\r\nIn the Senate, Benton moved to strike out this article; but the attempt\r\nwas defeated by a vote of 37 to 12, and the treaty was ratified.[62]\r\n\r\nThis stipulation of the treaty of 1842 was never properly carried out by\r\nthe United States for any length of time.[63] Consequently the same\r\ndifficulties as to search and visit by English vessels continued to\r\nrecur. Cases like the following were frequent. The \"Illinois,\" of\r\nGloucester, Massachusetts, while lying at Whydah, Africa, was boarded by\r\na British officer, but having American papers was unmolested. Three days\r\nlater she hoisted Spanish colors and sailed away with a cargo of slaves.\r\nNext morning she fell in with another British vessel and hoisted\r\nAmerican colors; the British ship had then no right to molest her; but\r\nthe captain of the slaver feared that she would, and therefore ran his\r\nvessel aground, slaves and all. The senior English officer reported that\r\n\"had Lieutenant Cumberland brought to and boarded the 'Illinois,'\r\nnotwithstanding the American colors which she hoisted,... the American\r\nmaster of the 'Illinois' ... would have complained to his Government of\r\nthe detention of his vessel.\"[64] Again, a vessel which had been boarded\r\nby British officers and found with American flag and papers was, a\r\nlittle later, captured under the Spanish flag with four hundred and\r\nthirty slaves. She had in the interim complained to the United States\r\ngovernment of the boarding.[65]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, England continued to urge the granting of a Right of Search,\r\nclaiming that the stand of the United States really amounted to the\r\nwholesale protection of pirates under her flag.[66] The United States\r\nanswered by alleging that even the Treaty of 1842 had been misconstrued\r\nby England,[67] whereupon there was much warm debate in Congress, and\r\nseveral attempts were made to abrogate the slave-trade article of the\r\ntreaty.[68] The pro-slavery party had become more and more suspicious of\r\nEngland's motives, since they had seen her abolition of the slave-trade\r\nblossom into abolition of the system itself, and they seized every\r\nopportunity to prevent co-operation with her. At the same time, European\r\ninterest in the question showed some signs of weakening, and no decided\r\naction was taken. In 1845 France changed her Right of Search\r\nstipulations of 1833 to one for joint cruising,[69] while the Germanic\r\nFederation,[70] Portugal,[71] and Chili[72]enounced the trade as piracy.\r\nIn 1844 Texas granted the Right of Search to England,[73] and in 1845\r\nBelgium signed the Quintuple Treaty.[74]\r\n\r\nDiscussion between England and the United States was revived when Cass\r\nheld the State portfolio, and, strange to say, the author of \"Cass's\r\nProtest\" went farther than any of his predecessors in acknowledging the\r\njustice of England's demands. Said he, in 1859: \"If The United States\r\nmaintained that, by carrying their flag at her masthead, any vessel\r\nbecame thereby entitled to the immunity which belongs to American\r\nvessels, they might well be reproached with assuming a position which\r\nwould go far towards shielding crimes upon the ocean from punishment;\r\nbut they advance no such pretension, while they concede that, if in the\r\nhonest examination of a vessel sailing under American colours, but\r\naccompanied by strongly-marked suspicious circumstances, a mistake is\r\nmade, and she is found to be entitled to the flag she bears, but no\r\ninjury is committed, and the conduct of the boarding party is\r\nirreproachable, no Government would be likely to make a case thus\r\nexceptional in its character a subject of serious reclamation.\"[75]\r\nWhile admitting this and expressing a desire to co-operate in the\r\nsuppression of the slave-trade, Cass nevertheless steadily refused all\r\nfurther overtures toward a mutual Right of Search.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the slave-traffic was so great in the decade 1850-1860\r\nthat Lord John Russell proposed to the governments of the United States,\r\nFrance, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, that they instruct their ministers\r\nto meet at London in May or June, 1860, to consider measures for the\r\nfinal abolition of the trade. He stated: \"It is ascertained, by\r\nrepeated instances, that the practice is for vessels to sail under the\r\nAmerican flag. If the flag is rightly assumed, and the papers correct,\r\nno British cruizer can touch them. If no slaves are on board, even\r\nthough the equipment, the fittings, the water-casks, and other\r\ncircumstances prove that the ship is on a Slave Trade venture, no\r\nAmerican cruizer can touch them.\"[76] Continued representations of this\r\nkind were made to the paralyzed United States government; indeed, the\r\nslave-trade of the world seemed now to float securely under her flag.\r\nNevertheless, Cass refused even to participate in the proposed\r\nconference, and later refused to accede to a proposal for joint cruising\r\noff the coast of Cuba.[77] Great Britain offered to relieve the United\r\nStates of any embarrassment by receiving all captured Africans into the\r\nWest Indies; but President Buchanan \"could not contemplate any such\r\narrangement,\" and obstinately refused to increase the suppressing\r\nsquadron.[78]\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the Civil War, the Lincoln administration, through\r\nSecretary Seward, immediately expressed a willingness to do all in its\r\npower to suppress the slave-trade.[79] Accordingly, June 7, 1862, a\r\ntreaty was signed with Great Britain granting a mutual limited Right of\r\nSearch, and establishing mixed courts for the trial of offenders at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, Sierra Leone, and New York.[80] The efforts of a\r\nhalf-century of diplomacy were finally crowned; Seward wrote to Adams,\r\n\"Had such a treaty been made in 1808, there would now have been no\r\nsedition here.\"[81]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Cf.

Among those present were Metternich, Richelieu,\r\n      Wellington, Castlereagh, Hardenberg, Bernstorff, Nesselrode,\r\n      and Capodistrias. Castlereagh made two propositions: 1. That\r\n      the five powers join in urging Portugal and Brazil to abolish\r\n      the trade May 20, 1820; 2. That the powers adopt the principle\r\n      of a mutual qualified Right of Search.

Between the years 1775 and 1825 occurred\r\neconomic events and changes of the highest importance and widest\r\ninfluence. Though all branches of industry felt the impulse of this new\r\nindustrial life, yet, \"if we consider single industries, cotton\r\nmanufacture has, during the nineteenth century, made the most\r\nmagnificent and gigantic advances.\"[1] This fact is easily explained by\r\nthe remarkable series of inventions that revolutionized this industry\r\nbetween 1738 and 1830, including Arkwright's, Watt's, Compton's, and\r\nCartwright's epoch-making contrivances.[2] The effect which these\r\ninventions had on the manufacture of cotton goods is best illustrated\r\nby the fact that in England, the chief cotton market of the world, the\r\nconsumption of raw cotton rose steadily from 13,000 bales in 1781, to\r\n572,000 in 1820, to 871,000 in 1830, and to 3,366,000 in 1860.[3] Very\r\nearly, therefore, came the query whence the supply of raw cotton was to\r\ncome. Tentative experiments on the rich, broad fields of the Southern\r\nUnited States, together with the indispensable invention of Whitney's\r\ncotton-gin, soon answered this question: a new economic future was\r\nopened up to this land, and immediately the whole South began to extend\r\nits cotton culture, and more and more to throw its whole energy into\r\nthis one staple.\r\n\r\nHere it was that the fatal mistake of compromising with slavery in the\r\nbeginning, and of the policy of _laissez-faire_ pursued thereafter,\r\nbecame painfully manifest; for, instead now of a healthy, normal,\r\neconomic development along proper industrial lines, we have the abnormal\r\nand fatal rise of a slave-labor large farming system, which, before it\r\nwas realized, had so intertwined itself with and braced itself upon the\r\neconomic forces of an industrial age, that a vast and terrible civil war\r\nwas necessary to displace it. The tendencies to a patriarchal serfdom,\r\nrecognizable in the age of Washington and Jefferson, began slowly but\r\nsurely to disappear; and in the second quarter of the century Southern\r\nslavery was irresistibly changing from a family institution to an\r\nindustrial system.\r\n\r\nThe development of Southern slavery has heretofore been viewed so\r\nexclusively from the ethical and social standpoint that we are apt to\r\nforget its close and indissoluble connection with the world's cotton\r\nmarket. Beginning with 1820, a little after the close of the Napoleonic\r\nwars, when the industry of cotton manufacture had begun its modern\r\ndevelopment and the South had definitely assumed her position as chief\r\nproducer of raw cotton, we find the average price of cotton per pound,\r\n8½_d._ From this time until 1845 the price steadily fell, until in the\r\nlatter year it reached 4_d._; the only exception to this fall was in the\r\nyears 1832-1839, when, among other things, a strong increase in the\r\nEnglish demand, together with an attempt of the young slave power to\r\n\"corner\" the market, sent the price up as high as 11_d._ The demand for\r\ncotton goods soon outran a crop which McCullough had pronounced\r\n\"prodigious,\" and after 1845 the price started on a steady rise, which,\r\nexcept for the checks suffered during the continental revolutions and\r\nthe Crimean War, continued until 1860.[4] The steady increase in the\r\nproduction of cotton explains the fall in price down to 1845. In 1822\r\nthe crop was a half-million bales; in 1831, a million; in 1838, a\r\nmillion and a half; and in 1840-1843, two million. By this time the\r\nworld's consumption of cotton goods began to increase so rapidly that,\r\nin spite of the increase in Southern crops, the price kept rising. Three\r\nmillion bales were gathered in 1852, three and a half million in 1856,\r\nand the remarkable crop of five million bales in 1860.[5]\r\n\r\nHere we have data to explain largely the economic development of the\r\nSouth. By 1822 the large-plantation slave system had gained footing; in\r\n1838-1839 it was able to show its power in the cotton \"corner;\" by the\r\nend of the next decade it had not only gained a solid economic\r\nfoundation, but it had built a closed oligarchy with a political policy.\r\nThe changes in price during the next few years drove out of competition\r\nmany survivors of the small-farming free-labor system, and put the slave\r\n_régime_ in position to dictate the policy of the nation. The zenith of\r\nthe system and the first inevitable signs of decay came in the years\r\n1850-1860, when the rising price of cotton threw the whole economic\r\nenergy of the South into its cultivation, leading to a terrible\r\nconsumption of soil and slaves, to a great increase in the size of\r\nplantations, and to increasing power and effrontery on the part of the\r\nslave barons. Finally, when a rising moral crusade conjoined with\r\nthreatened economic disaster, the oligarchy, encouraged by the state of\r\nthe cotton market, risked all on a political _coup-d'état_, which failed\r\nin the war of 1861-1865.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n75. ~The Attitude of the South.~ The attitude of the South toward the\r\nslave-trade changed _pari passu_ with this development of the cotton\r\ntrade. From 1808 to 1820 the South half wished to get rid of a\r\ntroublesome and abnormal institution, and yet saw no way to do so. The\r\nfear of insurrection and of the further spread of the disagreeable\r\nsystem led her to consent to the partial prohibition of the trade by\r\nsevere national enactments. Nevertheless, she had in the matter no\r\nsettled policy: she refused to support vigorously the execution of the\r\nlaws she had helped to make, and at the same time she acknowledged the\r\ntheoretical necessity of these laws. After 1820, however, there came a\r\ngradual change. The South found herself supplied with a body of slave\r\nlaborers, whose number had been augmented by large illicit importations,\r\nwith an abundance of rich land, and with all other natural facilities\r\nfor raising a crop which was in large demand and peculiarly adapted to\r\nslave labor. The increasing crop caused a new demand for slaves, and an\r\ninterstate slave-traffic arose between the Border and the Gulf States,\r\nwhich turned the former into slave-breeding districts, and bound them to\r\nthe slave States by ties of strong economic interest.\r\n\r\nAs the cotton crop continued to increase, this source of supply became\r\ninadequate, especially as the theory of land and slave consumption broke\r\ndown former ethical and prudential bounds. It was, for example, found\r\ncheaper to work a slave to death in a few years, and buy a new one, than\r\nto care for him in sickness and old age; so, too, it was easier to\r\ndespoil rich, new land in a few years of intensive culture, and move on\r\nto the Southwest, than to fertilize and conserve the soil.[7]\r\nConsequently, there early came a demand for land and slaves greater than\r\nthe country could supply. The demand for land showed itself in the\r\nannexation of Texas, the conquest of Mexico, and the movement toward the\r\nacquisition of Cuba. The demand for slaves was manifested in the illicit\r\ntraffic that noticeably increased about 1835, and reached large\r\nproportions by 1860. It was also seen in a disposition to attack the\r\ngovernment for stigmatizing the trade as criminal,[8] then in a\r\ndisinclination to take any measures which would have rendered our\r\nrepressive laws effective; and finally in such articulate declarations\r\nby prominent men as this: \"Experience having settled the point, that\r\nthis Trade _cannot be abolished by the use of force_, and that\r\nblockading squadrons serve only to make it more profitable and more\r\ncruel, I am surprised that the attempt is persisted in, unless as it\r\nserves as a cloak to some other purposes. It would be far better than it\r\nnow is, for the African, if the trade was free from all restrictions,\r\nand left to the mitigation and decay which time and competition would\r\nsurely bring about.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n76. ~The Attitude of the North and Congress.~ With the North as yet\r\nunawakened to the great changes taking place in the South, and with the\r\nattitude of the South thus in process of development, little or no\r\nconstructive legislation could be expected on the subject of the\r\nslave-trade. As the divergence in sentiment became more and more\r\npronounced, there were various attempts at legislation, all of which\r\nproved abortive. The pro-slavery party attempted, as early as 1826, and\r\nagain in 1828, to abolish the African agency and leave the Africans\r\npractically at the mercy of the States;[10] one or two attempts were\r\nmade to relax the few provisions which restrained the coastwise\r\ntrade;[11] and, after the treaty of 1842, Benton proposed to stop\r\nappropriations for the African squadron until England defined her\r\nposition on the Right of Search question.[12] The anti-slavery men\r\npresented several bills to amend and strengthen previous laws;[13] they\r\nsought, for instance, in vain to regulate the Texan trade, through which\r\nnumbers of slaves indirectly reached the United States.[14] Presidents\r\nand consuls earnestly recommended legislation to restrict the clearances\r\nof vessels bound on slave-trading voyages, and to hinder the facility\r\nwith which slavers obtained fraudulent papers.[15] Only one such bill\r\nsucceeded in passing the Senate, and that was dropped in the House.[16]\r\n\r\nThe only legislation of this period was confined to a few appropriation\r\nbills. Only one of these acts, that of 1823, appropriating $50,000,[17]\r\nwas designed materially to aid in the suppression of the trade, all the\r\nothers relating to expenses incurred after violations. After 1823 the\r\nappropriations dwindled, being made at intervals of one, two, and three\r\nyears, down to 1834, when the amount was $5,000. No further\r\nappropriations were made until 1842, when a few thousands above an\r\nunexpended surplus were appropriated. In 1843 $5,000 were given, and\r\nfinally, in 1846, $25,000 were secured; but this was the last sum\r\nobtainable until 1856.[18] Nearly all of these meagre appropriations\r\nwent toward reimbursing Southern plantation owners for the care and\r\nsupport of illegally imported Africans, and the rest to the maintenance\r\nof the African agency. Suspiciously large sums were paid for the first\r\npurpose, considering the fact that such Africans were always worked hard\r\nby those to whom they were farmed out, and often \"disappeared\" while in\r\ntheir hands. In the accounts we nevertheless find many items like that\r\nof $20,286.98 for the maintenance of Negroes imported on the\r\n\"Ramirez;\"[19] in 1827, $5,442.22 for the \"bounty, subsistence,\r\nclothing, medicine,\" etc., of fifteen Africans;[20] in 1835, $3,613 for\r\nthe support of thirty-eight slaves for two months (including a bill of\r\n$1,038 for medical attendance).[21]\r\n\r\nThe African agency suffered many vicissitudes. The first agent, Bacon,\r\nwho set out early in 1820, was authorized by President Monroe \"to form\r\nan establishment on the island of Sherbro, or elsewhere on the coast of\r\nAfrica,\" and to build barracks for three hundred persons. He was,\r\nhowever, warned \"not to connect your agency with the views or plans of\r\nthe Colonization Society, with which, under the law, the Government of\r\nthe United States has no concern.\" Bacon soon died, and was followed\r\nduring the next four years by Winn and Ayres; they succeeded in\r\nestablishing a government agency on Cape Mesurado, in conjunction with\r\nthat of the Colonization Society. The agent of that Society, Jehudi\r\nAshmun, became after 1822, the virtual head of the colony; he fortified\r\nand enlarged it, and laid the foundations of an independent community.\r\nThe succeeding government agents came to be merely official\r\nrepresentatives of the United States, and the distribution of free\r\nrations for liberated Africans ceased in 1827.\r\n\r\nBetween 1819 and 1830 two hundred and fifty-two recaptured Africans were\r\nsent to the agency, and $264,710 were expended. The property of the\r\ngovernment at the agency was valued at $18,895. From 1830 to 1840,\r\nnearly $20,000 more were expended, chiefly for the agents' salaries.\r\nAbout 1840 the appointment of an agent ceased, and the colony became\r\ngradually self-supporting and independent. It was proclaimed as the\r\nRepublic of Liberia in 1847.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n77. ~Imperfect Application of the Laws.~ In reviewing efforts toward the\r\nsuppression of the slave-trade from 1820 to 1850, it must be remembered\r\nthat nearly every cabinet had a strong, if not a predominating, Southern\r\nelement, and that consequently the efforts of the executive were\r\npowerfully influenced by the changing attitude of the South. Naturally,\r\nunder such circumstances, the government displayed little activity and\r\nno enthusiasm in the work. In 1824 a single vessel of the Gulf squadron\r\nwas occasionally sent to the African coast to return by the route\r\nusually followed by the slavers; no wonder that \"none of these or any\r\nother of our public ships have found vessels engaged in the slave trade\r\nunder the flag of the United States, ... although it is known that the\r\ntrade still exists to a most lamentable extent.\"[23] Indeed, all that an\r\nAmerican slaver need do was to run up a Spanish or a Portuguese flag, to\r\nbe absolutely secure from all attack or inquiry on the part of United\r\nStates vessels. Even this desultory method of suppression was not\r\nregular: in 1826 \"no vessel has been despatched to the coast of Africa\r\nfor several months,\"[24] and from that time until 1839 this country\r\nprobably had no slave-trade police upon the seas, except in the Gulf of\r\nMexico. In 1839 increasing violations led to the sending of two\r\nfast-sailing vessels to the African coast, and these were kept there\r\nmore or less regularly;[25] but even after the signing of the treaty of\r\n1842 the Secretary of the Navy reports: \"On the coast of Africa we have\r\n_no_ squadron. The small appropriation of the present year was believed\r\nto be scarcely sufficient.\"[26] Between 1843 and 1850 the coast squadron\r\nvaried from two to six vessels, with from thirty to ninety-eight\r\nguns;[27] \"but the force habitually and actively engaged in cruizing on\r\nthe ground frequented by slavers has probably been less by one-fourth,\r\nif we consider the size of the ships employed and their withdrawal for\r\npurposes of recreation and health, and the movement of the reliefs,\r\nwhose arrival does not correspond exactly with the departure of the\r\nvessels whose term of service has expired.\"[28] The reports of the navy\r\nshow that in only four of the eight years mentioned was the fleet, at\r\nthe time of report, at the stipulated size of eighty guns; and at times\r\nit was much below this, even as late as 1848, when only two vessels are\r\nreported on duty along the African coast.[29] As the commanders\r\nthemselves acknowledged, the squadron was too small and the\r\ncruising-ground too large to make joint cruising effective.[30]\r\n\r\nThe same story comes from the Brazil station: \"Nothing effectual can be\r\ndone towards stopping the slave trade, as our squadron is at present\r\norganized,\" wrote the consul at Rio Janeiro in 1847; \"when it is\r\nconsidered that the Brazil station extends from north of the equator to\r\nCape Horn on this continent, and includes a great part of Africa south\r\nof the equator, on both sides of the Cape of Good Hope, it must be\r\nadmitted that one frigate and one brig is a very insufficient force to\r\nprotect American commerce, and repress the participation in the slave\r\ntrade by our own vessels.\"[31] In the Gulf of Mexico cruisers were\r\nstationed most of the time, although even here there were at times\r\nurgent representations that the scarcity or the absence of such vessels\r\ngave the illicit trade great license.[32]\r\n\r\nOwing to this general negligence of the government, and also to its\r\nanxiety on the subject of the theoretic Right of Search, many officials\r\nwere kept in a state of chronic deception in regard to the trade. The\r\nenthusiasm of commanders was dampened by the lack of latitude allowed\r\nand by the repeated insistence in their orders on the non-existence of a\r\nRight of Search.[33] When one commander, realizing that he could not\r\ncover the trading-track with his fleet, requested English commanders to\r\ndetain suspicious American vessels until one of his vessels came up, the\r\ngovernment annulled the agreement as soon as it reached their ears,\r\nrebuked him, and the matter was alluded to in Congress long after with\r\nhorror.[34] According to the orders of cruisers, only slavers with\r\nslaves actually on board could be seized. Consequently, fully equipped\r\nslavers would sail past the American fleet, deliberately make all\r\npreparations for shipping a cargo, then, when the English were not near,\r\n\"sell\" the ship to a Spaniard, hoist the Spanish flag, and again sail\r\ngayly past the American fleet with a cargo of slaves. An English\r\ncommander reported: \"The officers of the United States' navy are\r\nextremely active and zealous in the cause, and no fault can be\r\nattributed to them, but it is greatly to be lamented that this blemish\r\nshould in so great a degree nullify our endeavours.\"[35]\r\n\r\n\r\n78. ~Responsibility of the Government.~ Not only did the government thus\r\nnegatively favor the slave-trade, but also many conscious, positive acts\r\nmust be attributed to a spirit hostile to the proper enforcement of the\r\nslave-trade laws. In cases of doubt, when the law needed executive\r\ninterpretation, the decision was usually in favor of the looser\r\nconstruction of the law; the trade from New Orleans to Mobile was, for\r\ninstance, declared not to be coastwise trade, and consequently, to the\r\njoy of the Cuban smugglers, was left utterly free and unrestricted.[36]\r\nAfter the conquest of Mexico, even vessels bound to California, by the\r\nway of Cape Horn, were allowed to clear coastwise, thus giving our flag\r\nto \"the slave-pirates of the whole world.\"[37] Attorney-General Nelson\r\ndeclared that the selling to a slave-trader of an American vessel, to be\r\ndelivered on the coast of Africa, was not aiding or abetting the\r\nslave-trade.[38] So easy was it for slavers to sail that corruption\r\namong officials was hinted at. \"There is certainly a want of proper\r\nvigilance at Havana,\" wrote Commander Perry in 1844, \"and perhaps at the\r\nports of the United States;\" and again, in the same year, \"I cannot but\r\nthink that the custom-house authorities in the United States are not\r\nsufficiently rigid in looking after vessels of suspicious\r\ncharacter.\"[39]\r\n\r\nIn the courts it was still next to impossible to secure the punishment\r\nof the most notorious slave-trader. In 1847 a consul writes: \"The slave\r\npower in this city [i.e., Rio Janeiro] is extremely great, and a consul\r\ndoing his duty needs to be supported kindly and effectually at home. In\r\nthe case of the 'Fame,' where the vessel was diverted from the business\r\nintended by her owners and employed in the slave trade--both of which\r\noffences are punishable with death, if I rightly read the laws--I sent\r\nhome the two mates charged with these offences, for trial, the first\r\nmate to Norfolk, the second mate to Philadelphia. What was done with the\r\nfirst mate I know not. In the case of the man sent to Philadelphia, Mr.\r\nCommissioner Kane states that a clear prima facie case is made out, and\r\nthen holds him to bail in the sum of _one thousand dollars_, which would\r\nbe paid by any slave trader in Rio, on the _presentation of a draft_. In\r\nall this there is little encouragement for exertion.\"[40] Again, the\r\n\"Perry\" in 1850 captured a slaver which was about to ship 1,800 slaves.\r\nThe captain admitted his guilt, and was condemned in the United States\r\nDistrict Court at New York. Nevertheless, he was admitted to bail of\r\n$5,000; this being afterward reduced to $3,000, he forfeited it and\r\nescaped. The mate was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary.[41]\r\nAlso several slavers sent home to the United States by the British, with\r\nclear evidence of guilt, escaped condemnation through\r\ntechnicalities.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n79. ~Activity of the Slave-Trade, 1820-1850.~ The enhanced price of\r\nslaves throughout the American slave market, brought about by the new\r\nindustrial development and the laws against the slave-trade, was the\r\nirresistible temptation that drew American capital and enterprise into\r\nthat traffic. In the United States, in spite of the large interstate\r\ntraffic, the average price of slaves rose from about $325 in 1840, to\r\n$360 in 1850, and to $500 in 1860.[43] Brazil and Cuba offered similar\r\ninducements to smugglers, and the American flag was ready to protect\r\nsuch pirates. As a result, the American slave-trade finally came to be\r\ncarried on principally by United States capital, in United States ships,\r\nofficered by United States citizens, and under the United States flag.\r\n\r\nExecutive reports repeatedly acknowledged this fact. In 1839 \"a careful\r\nrevision of these laws\" is recommended by the President, in order that\r\n\"the integrity and honor of our flag may be carefully preserved.\"[44] In\r\nJune, 1841, the President declares: \"There is reason to believe that the\r\ntraffic is on the increase,\" and advocates \"vigorous efforts.\"[45] His\r\nmessage in December of the same year acknowledges: \"That the American\r\nflag is grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations\r\nis but too probable.\"[46] The special message of 1845 explains at length\r\nthat \"it would seem\" that a regular policy of evading the laws is\r\ncarried on: American vessels with the knowledge of the owners are\r\nchartered by notorious slave dealers in Brazil, aided by English\r\ncapitalists, with this intent.[47] The message of 1849 \"earnestly\"\r\ninvites the attention of Congress \"to an amendment of our existing laws\r\nrelating to the African slave-trade, with a view to the effectual\r\nsuppression of that barbarous traffic. It is not to be denied,\"\r\ncontinues the message, \"that this trade is still, in part, carried on by\r\nmeans of vessels built in the United States, and owned or navigated by\r\nsome of our citizens.\"[48] Governor Buchanan of Liberia reported in\r\n1839: \"The chief obstacle to the success of the very active measures\r\npursued by the British government for the suppression of the slave-trade\r\non the coast, is the _American flag_. Never was the proud banner of\r\nfreedom so extensively used by those pirates upon liberty and humanity,\r\nas at this season.\"[49] One well-known American slaver was boarded\r\nfifteen times and twice taken into port, but always escaped by means of\r\nher papers.[50] Even American officers report that the English are doing\r\nall they can, but that the American flag protects the trade.[51] The\r\nevidence which literally poured in from our consuls and ministers at\r\nBrazil adds to the story of the guilt of the United States.[52] It was\r\nproven that the participation of United States citizens in the trade was\r\nlarge and systematic. One of the most notorious slave merchants of\r\nBrazil said: \"I am worried by the Americans, who insist upon my hiring\r\ntheir vessels for slave-trade.\"[53] Minister Proffit stated, in 1844,\r\nthat the \"slave-trade is almost entirely carried on under our flag, in\r\nAmerican-built vessels.\"[54] So, too, in Cuba: the British commissioners\r\naffirm that American citizens were openly engaged in the traffic;\r\nvessels arrived undisguised at Havana from the United States, and\r\ncleared for Africa as slavers after an alleged sale.[55] The American\r\nconsul, Trist, was proven to have consciously or unconsciously aided\r\nthis trade by the issuance of blank clearance papers.[56]\r\n\r\nThe presence of American capital in these enterprises, and the\r\nconnivance of the authorities, were proven in many cases and known in\r\nscores. In 1837 the English government informed the United States that\r\nfrom the papers of a captured slaver it appeared that the notorious\r\nslave-trading firm, Blanco and Carballo of Havana, who owned the vessel,\r\nhad correspondents in the United States: \"at Baltimore, Messrs. Peter\r\nHarmony and Co., in New York, Robert Barry, Esq.\"[57] The slaver\r\n\"Martha\" of New York, captured by the \"Perry,\" contained among her\r\npapers curious revelations of the guilt of persons in America who were\r\nlittle suspected.[58] The slaver \"Prova,\" which was allowed to lie in\r\nthe harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, and refit, was afterwards\r\ncaptured with two hundred and twenty-five slaves on board.[59] The real\r\nreason that prevented many belligerent Congressmen from pressing certain\r\nsearch claims against England lay in the fact that the unjustifiable\r\ndetentions had unfortunately revealed so much American guilt that it was\r\ndeemed wiser to let the matter end in talk. For instance, in 1850\r\nCongress demanded information as to illegal searches, and President\r\nFillmore's report showed the uncomfortable fact that, of the ten\r\nAmerican ships wrongly detained by English men-of-war, nine were proven\r\nred-handed slavers.[60]\r\n\r\nThe consul at Havana reported, in 1836, that whole cargoes of slaves\r\nfresh from Africa were being daily shipped to Texas in American vessels,\r\nthat 1,000 had been sent within a few months, that the rate was\r\nincreasing, and that many of these slaves \"can scarcely fail to find\r\ntheir way into the United States.\" Moreover, the consul acknowledged\r\nthat ships frequently cleared for the United States in ballast, taking\r\non a cargo at some secret point.[61] When with these facts we consider\r\nthe law facilitating \"recovery\" of slaves from Texas,[62] the repeated\r\nrefusals to regulate the Texan trade, and the shelving of a proposed\r\ncongressional investigation into these matters,[63] conjecture becomes a\r\npractical certainty. It was estimated in 1838 that 15,000 Africans were\r\nannually taken to Texas, and \"there are even grounds for suspicion that\r\nthere are other places ... where slaves are introduced.\"[64] Between\r\n1847 and 1853 the slave smuggler Drake had a slave depot in the Gulf,\r\nwhere sometimes as many as 1,600 Negroes were on hand, and the owners\r\nwere continually importing and shipping. \"The joint-stock company,\"\r\nwrites this smuggler, \"was a very extensive one, and connected with\r\nleading American and Spanish mercantile houses. Our island[65] was\r\nvisited almost weekly, by agents from Cuba, New York, Baltimore,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and New Orleans.... The seasoned and instructed\r\nslaves were taken to Texas, or Florida, overland, and to Cuba, in\r\nsailing-boats. As no squad contained more than half a dozen, no\r\ndifficulty was found in posting them to the United States, without\r\ndiscovery, and generally without suspicion.... The Bay Island plantation\r\nsent ventures weekly to the Florida Keys. Slaves were taken into the\r\ngreat American swamps, and there kept till wanted for the market.\r\nHundreds were sold as captured runaways from the Florida wilderness. We\r\nhad agents in every slave State; and our coasters were built in Maine,\r\nand came out with lumber. I could tell curious stories ... of this\r\nbusiness of smuggling Bozal negroes into the United States. It is\r\ngrowing more profitable every year, and if you should hang all the\r\nYankee merchants engaged in it, hundreds would fill their places.\"[66]\r\nInherent probability and concurrent testimony confirm the substantial\r\ntruth of such confessions. For instance, one traveller discovers on a\r\nSouthern plantation Negroes who can speak no English.[67] The careful\r\nreports of the Quakers \"apprehend that many [slaves] are also introduced\r\ninto the United States.\"[68] Governor Mathew of the Bahama Islands\r\nreports that \"in more than one instance, Bahama vessels with coloured\r\ncrews have been purposely wrecked on the coast of Florida, and the crews\r\nforcibly sold.\" This was brought to the notice of the United States\r\nauthorities, but the district attorney of Florida could furnish no\r\ninformation.[69]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the slave-trade in 1850, on the threshold of the\r\ncritical decade which by a herculean effort was destined finally to\r\nsuppress it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Beer, _Geschichte des Welthandels im 19^{ten}\r\n      Jahrhundert_, II. 67.\r\n\r\n  [2] A list of these inventions most graphically illustrates\r\n      this advance:--\r\n\r\n        1738,    John Jay, fly-shuttle.\r\n                 John Wyatt, spinning by rollers.\r\n        1748,    Lewis Paul, carding-machine.\r\n        1760,    Robert Kay, drop-box.\r\n        1769,    Richard Arkwright, water-frame and throstle.\r\n                 James Watt, steam-engine.\r\n        1772,    James Lees, improvements on carding-machine.\r\n        1775,    Richard Arkwright, series of combinations.\r\n        1779,    Samuel Compton, mule.\r\n        1785,    Edmund Cartwright, power-loom.\r\n        1803-4,  Radcliffe and Johnson, dressing-machine.\r\n        1817,    Roberts, fly-frame.\r\n        1818,    William Eaton, self-acting frame.\r\n        1825-30, Roberts, improvements on mule.\r\n\r\n      Cf.

Attitude of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n80. ~The Movement against the Slave-Trade Laws.~ It was not altogether a\r\nmistaken judgment that led the constitutional fathers to consider the\r\nslave-trade as the backbone of slavery. An economic system based on\r\nslave labor will find, sooner or later, that the demand for the cheapest\r\nslave labor cannot long be withstood. Once degrade the laborer so that\r\nhe cannot assert his own rights, and there is but one limit below which\r\nhis price cannot be reduced. That limit is not his physical well-being,\r\nfor it may be, and in the Gulf States it was, cheaper to work him\r\nrapidly to death; the limit is simply the cost of procuring him and\r\nkeeping him alive a profitable length of time. Only the moral sense of a\r\ncommunity can keep helpless labor from sinking to this level; and when a\r\ncommunity has once been debauched by slavery, its moral sense offers\r\nlittle resistance to economic demand. This was the case in the West\r\nIndies and Brazil; and although better moral stamina held the crisis\r\nback longer in the United States, yet even here the ethical standard of\r\nthe South was not able to maintain itself against the demands of the\r\ncotton industry. When, after 1850, the price of slaves had risen to a\r\nmonopoly height, the leaders of the plantation system, brought to the\r\nedge of bankruptcy by the crude and reckless farming necessary under a\r\nslave _régime_, and baffled, at least temporarily, in their quest of new\r\nrich land to exploit, began instinctively to feel that the only\r\nsalvation of American slavery lay in the reopening of the African\r\nslave-trade.\r\n\r\nIt took but a spark to put this instinctive feeling into words, and\r\nwords led to deeds. The movement first took definite form in the ever\r\nradical State of South Carolina. In 1854 a grand jury in the\r\nWilliamsburg district declared, \"as our unanimous opinion, that the\r\nFederal law abolishing the African Slave Trade is a public grievance. We\r\nhold this trade has been and would be, if re-established, a blessing to\r\nthe American people, and a benefit to the African himself.\"[1] This\r\nattracted only local attention; but when, in 1856, the governor of the\r\nState, in his annual message, calmly argued at length for a reopening of\r\nthe trade, and boldly declared that \"if we cannot supply the demand for\r\nslave labor, then we must expect to be supplied with a species of labor\r\nwe do not want,\"[2] such words struck even Southern ears like \"a thunder\r\nclap in a calm day.\"[3] And yet it needed but a few years to show that\r\nSouth Carolina had merely been the first to put into words the\r\ninarticulate thought of a large minority, if not a majority, of the\r\ninhabitants of the Gulf States.\r\n\r\n\r\n81. ~Commercial Conventions of 1855-56.~ The growth of the movement is\r\nbest followed in the action of the Southern Commercial Convention, an\r\nannual gathering which seems to have been fairly representative of a\r\nconsiderable part of Southern opinion. In the convention that met at New\r\nOrleans in 1855, McGimsey of Louisiana introduced a resolution\r\ninstructing the Southern Congressmen to secure the repeal of the\r\nslave-trade laws. This resolution went to the Committee on Resolutions,\r\nand was not reported.[4] In 1856, in the convention at Savannah, W.B.\r\nGoulden of Georgia moved that the members of Congress be requested to\r\nbestir themselves energetically to have repealed all laws which forbade\r\nthe slave-trade. By a vote of 67 to 18 the convention refused to debate\r\nthe motion, but appointed a committee to present at the next convention\r\nthe facts relating to a reopening of the trade.[5] In regard to this\r\naction a pamphlet of the day said: \"There were introduced into the\r\nconvention two leading measures, viz.: the laying of a State tariff on\r\nnorthern goods, and the reopening of the slave-trade; the one to advance\r\nour commercial interest, the other our agricultural interest, and which,\r\nwhen taken together, as they were doubtless intended to be, and although\r\nthey have each been attacked by presses of doubtful service to the\r\nSouth, are characterized in the private judgment of politicians as one\r\nof the completest southern remedies ever submitted to popular action....\r\nThe proposition to revive, or more properly to reopen, the slave trade\r\nis as yet but imperfectly understood, in its intentions and probable\r\nresults, by the people of the South, and but little appreciated by them.\r\nIt has been received in all parts of the country with an undefined sort\r\nof repugnance, a sort of squeamishness, which is incident to all such\r\nviolations of moral prejudices, and invariably wears off on familiarity\r\nwith the subject. The South will commence by enduring, and end by\r\nembracing the project.\"[6] The matter being now fully before the public\r\nthrough these motions, Governor Adams's message, and newspaper and\r\npamphlet discussion, the radical party pushed the project with all\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n82. ~Commercial Conventions of 1857-58.~ The first piece of regular\r\nbusiness that came before the Commercial Convention at Knoxville,\r\nTennessee, August 10, 1857, was a proposal to recommend the abrogation\r\nof the 8th Article of the Treaty of Washington, on the slave-trade. An\r\namendment offered by Sneed of Tennessee, declaring it inexpedient and\r\nagainst settled policy to reopen the trade, was voted down, Alabama,\r\nArkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia\r\nrefusing to agree to it. The original motion then passed; and the\r\nradicals, satisfied with their success in the first skirmish, again\r\nsecured the appointment of a committee to report at the next meeting on\r\nthe subject of reopening the slave-trade.[7] This next meeting assembled\r\nMay 10, 1858, in a Gulf State, Alabama, in the city of Montgomery.\r\nSpratt of South Carolina, the slave-trade champion, presented an\r\nelaborate majority report from the committee, and recommended the\r\nfollowing resolutions:--\r\n\r\n    1. _Resolved_, That slavery is right, and that being right,\r\n    there can be no wrong in the natural means to its formation.\r\n\r\n    2. _Resolved_, That it is expedient and proper that the foreign\r\n    slave trade should be re-opened, and that this Convention will\r\n    lend its influence to any legitimate measure to that end.\r\n\r\n    3. _Resolved_, That a committee, consisting of one from each\r\n    slave State, be appointed to consider of the means, consistent\r\n    with the duty and obligations of these States, for re-opening\r\n    the foreign slave-trade, and that they report their plan to the\r\n    next meeting of this Convention.\r\n\r\nYancey, from the same committee, presented a minority report, which,\r\nthough it demanded the repeal of the national prohibitory laws, did not\r\nadvocate the reopening of the trade by the States.\r\n\r\nMuch debate ensued. Pryor of Virginia declared the majority report \"a\r\nproposition to dissolve the Union.\" Yancey declared that \"he was for\r\ndisunion now. [Applause.]\" He defended the principle of the slave-trade,\r\nand said: \"If it is right to buy slaves in Virginia and carry them to\r\nNew Orleans, why is it not right to buy them in Cuba, Brazil, or Africa,\r\nand carry them there?\" The opposing speeches made little attempt to meet\r\nthis uncomfortable logic; but, nevertheless, opposition enough was\r\ndeveloped to lay the report on the table until the next convention, with\r\norders that it be printed, in the mean time, as a radical campaign\r\ndocument. Finally the convention passed a resolution:--\r\n\r\n    That it is inexpedient for any State, or its citizens, to\r\n    attempt to re-open the African slave-trade while that State is\r\n    one of the United States of America.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n83. ~Commercial Convention of 1859.~ The Convention of 1859 met at\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi, May 9-19, and the slave-trade party came ready\r\nfor a fray. On the second day Spratt called up his resolutions, and the\r\nnext day the Committee on Resolutions recommended that, _\"in the opinion\r\nof this Convention, all laws, State or Federal, prohibiting the African\r\nslave trade, ought to be repealed.\"_ Two minority reports accompanied\r\nthis resolution: one proposed to postpone action, on account of the\r\nfutility of the attempt at that time; the other report recommended that,\r\nsince repeal of the national laws was improbable, nullification by the\r\nStates impracticable, and action by the Supreme Court unlikely,\r\ntherefore the States should bring in the Africans as apprentices, a\r\nsystem the legality of which \"is incontrovertible.\" \"The only difficult\r\nquestion,\" it was said, \"is the future status of the apprentices after\r\nthe expiration of their term of servitude.\"[9] Debate on these\r\npropositions began in the afternoon. A brilliant speech on the\r\nresumption of the importation of slaves, says Foote of Mississippi, \"was\r\nlistened to with breathless attention and applauded vociferously. Those\r\nof us who rose in opposition were looked upon by the excited assemblage\r\npresent as _traitors_ to the best interests of the South, and only\r\nworthy of expulsion from the body. The excitement at last grew so high\r\nthat personal violence was menaced, and some dozen of the more\r\nconservative members of the convention withdrew from the hall in which\r\nit was holding its sittings.\"[10] \"It was clear,\" adds De Bow, \"that the\r\npeople of Vicksburg looked upon it [i.e., the convention] with some\r\ndistrust.\"[11] When at last a ballot was taken, the first resolution\r\npassed by a vote of 40 to 19.[12] Finally, the 8th Article of the Treaty\r\nof Washington was again condemned; and it was also suggested, in the\r\nnewspaper which was the official organ of the meeting, that \"the\r\nConvention raise a fund to be dispensed in premiums for the best\r\nsermons in favor of reopening the African Slave Trade.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n84. ~Public Opinion in the South.~ This record of the Commercial\r\nConventions probably gives a true reflection of the development of\r\nextreme opinion on the question of reopening the slave-trade. First, it\r\nis noticeable that on this point there was a distinct divergence of\r\nopinion and interest between the Gulf and the Border States, and it was\r\nthis more than any moral repugnance that checked the radicals. The whole\r\nmovement represented the economic revolt of the slave-consuming\r\ncotton-belt against their base of labor supply. This revolt was only\r\nprevented from gaining its ultimate end by the fact that the Gulf States\r\ncould not get on without the active political co-operation of the Border\r\nStates. Thus, although such hot-heads as Spratt were not able, even as\r\nlate as 1859, to carry a substantial majority of the South with them in\r\nan attempt to reopen the trade at all hazards, yet the agitation did\r\nsucceed in sweeping away nearly all theoretical opposition to the trade,\r\nand left the majority of Southern people in an attitude which regarded\r\nthe reopening of the African slave-trade as merely a question of\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\nThis growth of Southern opinion is clearly to be followed in the\r\nnewspapers and pamphlets of the day, in Congress, and in many\r\nsignificant movements. The Charleston _Standard_ in a series of articles\r\nstrongly advocated the reopening of the trade; the Richmond _Examiner_,\r\nthough opposing the scheme as a Virginia paper should, was brought to\r\n\"acknowledge that the laws which condemn the Slave-trade imply an\r\naspersion upon the character of the South.[14] In March, 1859, the\r\n_National Era_ said: \"There can be no doubt that the idea of reviving\r\nthe African Slave Trade is gaining ground in the South. Some two months\r\nago we could quote strong articles from ultra Southern journals against\r\nthe traffic; but of late we have been sorry to observe in the same\r\njournals an ominous silence upon the subject, while the advocates of\r\n'free trade in negroes' are earnest and active.\"[15] The Savannah\r\n_Republican_, which at first declared the movement to be of no serious\r\nintent, conceded, in 1859, that it was gaining favor, and that\r\nnine-tenths of the Democratic Congressional Convention favored it, and\r\nthat even those who did not advocate a revival demanded the abolition of\r\nthe laws.[16] A correspondent from South Carolina writes, December 18,\r\n1859: \"The nefarious project of opening it [i.e., the slave trade] has\r\nbeen started here in that prurient temper of the times which manifests\r\nitself in disunion schemes.... My State is strangely and terribly\r\ninfected with all this sort of thing.... One feeling that gives a\r\ncountenance to the opening of the slave trade is, that it will be a sort\r\nof spite to the North and defiance of their opinions.\"[17] The New\r\nOrleans _Delta_ declared that those who voted for the slave-trade in\r\nCongress were men \"whose names will be honored hereafter for the\r\nunflinching manner in which they stood up for principle, for truth, and\r\nconsistency, as well as the vital interests of the South.\"[18]\r\n\r\n85. ~The Question in Congress.~ Early in December, 1856, the subject\r\nreached Congress; and although the agitation was then new, fifty-seven\r\nSouthern Congressmen refused to declare a re-opening of the slave-trade\r\n\"shocking to the moral sentiment of the enlightened portion of mankind,\"\r\nand eight refused to call the reopening even \"unwise\" and\r\n\"inexpedient.\"[19] Three years later, January 31, 1859, it was\r\nimpossible, in a House of one hundred and ninety-nine members, to get a\r\ntwo-thirds vote in order even to consider Kilgore's resolutions, which\r\ndeclared \"that no legislation can be too thorough in its measures, nor\r\ncan any penalty known to the catalogue of modern punishment for crime be\r\ntoo severe against a traffic so inhuman and unchristian.\"[20]\r\n\r\nCongressmen and other prominent men hastened with the rising tide.[21]\r\nDowdell of Alabama declared the repressive acts \"highly offensive;\" J.B.\r\nClay of Kentucky was \"opposed to all these laws;\"[22] Seward of Georgia\r\ndeclared them \"wrong, and a violation of the Constitution;\"[23]\r\nBarksdale of Mississippi agreed with this sentiment; Crawford of Georgia\r\nthreatened a reopening of the trade; Miles of South Carolina was for\r\n\"sweeping away\" all restrictions;[24] Keitt of South Carolina wished to\r\nwithdraw the African squadron, and to cease to brand slave-trading as\r\npiracy;[25] Brown of Mississippi \"would repeal the law instantly;\"[26]\r\nAlexander Stephens, in his farewell address to his constituents, said:\r\n\"Slave states cannot be made without Africans.... [My object is] to\r\nbring clearly to your mind the great truth that without an increase of\r\nAfrican slaves from abroad, you may not expect or look for many more\r\nslave States.\"[27] Jefferson Davis strongly denied \"any coincidence of\r\nopinion with those who prate of the inhumanity and sinfulness of the\r\ntrade. The interest of Mississippi,\" said he, \"not of the African,\r\ndictates my conclusion.\" He opposed the immediate reopening of the trade\r\nin Mississippi for fear of a paralyzing influx of Negroes, but carefully\r\nadded: \"This conclusion, in relation to Mississippi, is based upon my\r\nview of her _present_ condition, _not_ upon any _general theory_. It is\r\nnot supposed to be applicable to Texas, to New Mexico, or to any _future\r\nacquisitions_ to be made south of the Rio Grande.\"[28] John Forsyth, who\r\nfor seven years conducted the slave-trade diplomacy of the nation,\r\ndeclared, about 1860: \"But one stronghold of its [i.e., slavery's]\r\nenemies remains to be carried, to _complete its triumph_ and assure its\r\nwelfare,--that is the existing prohibition of the African\r\nSlave-trade.\"[29] Pollard, in his _Black Diamonds_, urged the\r\nimportation of Africans as \"laborers.\" \"This I grant you,\" said he,\r\n\"would be practically the re-opening of the African slave trade; but ...\r\nyou will find that it very often becomes necessary to evade the letter\r\nof the law, in some of the greatest measures of social happiness and\r\npatriotism.\"[30]\r\n\r\n\r\n86. ~Southern Policy in 1860.~ The matter did not rest with mere words.\r\nDuring the session of the Vicksburg Convention, an \"African Labor Supply\r\nAssociation\" was formed, under the presidency of J.D.B. De Bow, editor\r\nof _De Bow's Review_, and ex-superintendent of the seventh census. The\r\nobject of the association was \"to promote the supply of African\r\nlabor.\"[31] In 1857 the committee of the South Carolina legislature to\r\nwhom the Governor's slave-trade message was referred made an elaborate\r\nreport, which declared in italics: _\"The South at large does need a\r\nre-opening of the African slave trade.\"_ Pettigrew, the only member who\r\ndisagreed to this report, failed of re-election. The report contained an\r\nextensive argument to prove the kingship of cotton, the perfidy of\r\nEnglish philanthropy, and the lack of slaves in the South, which, it was\r\nsaid, would show a deficit of six hundred thousand slaves by 1878.[32]\r\nIn Georgia, about this time, an attempt to expunge the slave-trade\r\nprohibition in the State Constitution lacked but one vote of\r\npassing.[33] From these slower and more legal movements came others\r\nless justifiable. The long argument on the \"apprentice\" system finally\r\nbrought a request to the collector of the port at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, from E. Lafitte & Co., for a clearance to Africa for the\r\npurpose of importing African \"emigrants.\" The collector appealed to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb of Georgia, who flatly refused to\r\ntake the bait, and replied that if the \"emigrants\" were brought in as\r\nslaves, it would be contrary to United States law; if as freemen, it\r\nwould be contrary to their own State law.[34] In Louisiana a still more\r\nradical movement was attempted, and a bill passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives authorizing a company to import two thousand five\r\nhundred Africans, \"indentured\" for fifteen years \"at least.\" The bill\r\nlacked but two votes of passing the Senate.[35] It was said that the\r\n_Georgian_, of Savannah, contained a notice of an agricultural society\r\nwhich \"unanimously resolved to offer a premium of $25 for the best\r\nspecimen of a live African imported into the United States within the\r\nlast twelve months.\"[36]\r\n\r\nIt would not be true to say that there was in the South in 1860\r\nsubstantial unanimity on the subject of reopening the slave-trade;\r\nnevertheless, there certainly was a large and influential minority,\r\nincluding perhaps a majority of citizens of the Gulf States, who favored\r\nthe project, and, in defiance of law and morals, aided and abetted its\r\nactual realization. Various movements, it must be remembered, gained\r\nmuch of their strength from the fact that their success meant a partial\r\nnullification of the slave-trade laws. The admission of Texas added\r\nprobably seventy-five thousand recently imported slaves to the Southern\r\nstock; the movement against Cuba, which culminated in the \"Ostend\r\nManifesto\" of Buchanan, Mason, and Soulé, had its chief impetus in the\r\nthousands of slaves whom Americans had poured into the island. Finally,\r\nthe series of filibustering expeditions against Cuba, Mexico, and\r\nCentral America were but the wilder and more irresponsible attempts to\r\nsecure both slave territory and slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n87. ~Increase of the Slave-Trade from 1850 to 1860.~ The long and open\r\nagitation for the reopening of the slave-trade, together with the fact\r\nthat the South had been more or less familiar with violations of the\r\nlaws since 1808, led to such a remarkable increase of illicit traffic\r\nand actual importations in the decade 1850-1860, that the movement may\r\nalmost be termed a reopening of the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nIn the foreign slave-trade our own officers continue to report \"how\r\nshamefully our flag has been used;\"[37] and British officers write \"that\r\nat least one half of the successful part of the slave trade is carried\r\non under the American flag,\" and this because \"the number of American\r\ncruisers on the station is so small, in proportion to the immense extent\r\nof the slave-dealing coast.\"[38] The fitting out of slavers became a\r\nflourishing business in the United States, and centred at New York City.\r\n\"Few of our readers,\" writes a periodical of the day, \"are aware of the\r\nextent to which this infernal traffic is carried on, by vessels clearing\r\nfrom New York, and in close alliance with our legitimate trade; and that\r\ndown-town merchants of wealth and respectability are extensively engaged\r\nin buying and selling African Negroes, and have been, with comparatively\r\nlittle interruption, for an indefinite number of years.\"[39] Another\r\nperiodical says: \"The number of persons engaged in the slave-trade, and\r\nthe amount of capital embarked in it, exceed our powers of calculation.\r\nThe city of New York has been until of late [1862] the principal port of\r\nthe world for this infamous commerce; although the cities of Portland\r\nand Boston are only second to her in that distinction. Slave dealers\r\nadded largely to the wealth of our commercial metropolis; they\r\ncontributed liberally to the treasuries of political organizations, and\r\ntheir bank accounts were largely depleted to carry elections in New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.\"[40] During eighteen months of\r\nthe years 1859-1860 eighty-five slavers are reported to have been\r\nfitted out in New York harbor,[41] and these alone transported from\r\n30,000 to 60,000 slaves annually.[42] The United States deputy marshal\r\nof that district declared in 1856 that the business of fitting out\r\nslavers \"was never prosecuted with greater energy than at present. The\r\noccasional interposition of the legal authorities exercises no apparent\r\ninfluence for its suppression. It is seldom that one or more vessels\r\ncannot be designated at the wharves, respecting which there is evidence\r\nthat she is either in or has been concerned in the Traffic.\"[43] On the\r\ncoast of Africa \"it is a well-known fact that most of the Slave ships\r\nwhich visit the river are sent from New York and New Orleans.\"[44]\r\n\r\nThe absence of United States war-ships at the Brazilian station enabled\r\nAmerican smugglers to run in cargoes, in spite of the prohibitory law.\r\nOne cargo of five hundred slaves was landed in 1852, and the _Correio\r\nMercantil_ regrets \"that it was the flag of the United States which\r\ncovered this act of piracy, sustained by citizens of that great\r\nnation.\"[45] When the Brazil trade declined, the illicit Cuban trade\r\ngreatly increased, and the British consul reported: \"Almost all the\r\nslave expeditions for some time past have been fitted out in the United\r\nStates, chiefly at New York.\"[46]\r\n\r\n88. ~Notorious Infractions of the Laws.~ This decade is especially\r\nnoteworthy for the great increase of illegal importations into the\r\nSouth. These became bold, frequent, and notorious. Systematic\r\nintroduction on a considerable scale probably commenced in the forties,\r\nalthough with great secrecy. \"To have boldly ventured into New Orleans,\r\nwith negroes freshly imported from Africa, would not only have brought\r\ndown upon the head of the importer the vengeance of our very\r\nphilanthropic Uncle Sam, but also the anathemas of the whole sect of\r\nphilanthropists and negrophilists everywhere. To import them for years,\r\nhowever, into quiet places, evading with impunity the penalty of the\r\nlaw, and the ranting of the thin-skinned sympathizers with Africa, was\r\ngradually to popularize the traffic by creating a demand for laborers,\r\nand thus to pave the way for the _gradual revival of the slave trade_.\r\nTo this end, a few men, bold and energetic, determined, ten or twelve\r\nyears ago [1848 or 1850], to commence the business of importing negroes,\r\nslowly at first, but surely; and for this purpose they selected a few\r\nsecluded places on the coast of Florida, Georgia and Texas, for the\r\npurpose of concealing their stock until it could be sold out. Without\r\nspecifying other places, let me draw your attention to a deep and abrupt\r\npocket or indentation in the coast of Texas, about thirty miles from\r\nBrazos Santiago. Into this pocket a slaver could run at any hour of the\r\nnight, because there was no hindrance at the entrance, and here she\r\ncould discharge her cargo of movables upon the projecting bluff, and\r\nagain proceed to sea inside of three hours. The live stock thus landed\r\ncould be marched a short distance across the main island, over a porous\r\nsoil which refuses to retain the recent foot-prints, until they were\r\nagain placed in boats, and were concealed upon some of the innumerable\r\nlittle islands which thicken on the waters of the Laguna in the rear.\r\nThese islands, being covered with a thick growth of bushes and grass,\r\noffer an inscrutable hiding place for the 'black diamonds.'\"[47] These\r\nmethods became, however, toward 1860, too slow for the radicals, and the\r\ntrade grew more defiant and open. The yacht \"Wanderer,\" arrested on\r\nsuspicion in New York and released, landed in Georgia six months later\r\nfour hundred and twenty slaves, who were never recovered.[48] The\r\nAugusta _Despatch_ says: \"Citizens of our city are probably interested\r\nin the enterprise. It is hinted that this is the third cargo landed by\r\nthe same company, during the last six months.\"[49] Two parties of\r\nAfricans were brought into Mobile with impunity. One bark, strongly\r\nsuspected of having landed a cargo of slaves, was seized on the Florida\r\ncoast; another vessel was reported to be landing slaves near Mobile; a\r\nletter from Jacksonville, Florida, stated that a bark had left there for\r\nAfrica to ship a cargo for Florida and Georgia.[50] Stephen A. Douglas\r\nsaid \"that there was not the shadow of doubt that the Slave-trade had\r\nbeen carried on quite extensively for a long time back, and that there\r\nhad been more Slaves imported into the southern States, during the last\r\nyear, than had ever been imported before in any one year, even when the\r\nSlave-trade was legal. It was his confident belief, that over fifteen\r\nthousand Slaves had been brought into this country during the past year\r\n[1859.] He had seen, with his own eyes, three hundred of those\r\nrecently-imported, miserable beings, in a Slave-pen in Vicksburg, Miss.,\r\nand also large numbers at Memphis, Tenn.\"[51] It was currently reported\r\nthat depots for these slaves existed in over twenty large cities and\r\ntowns in the South, and an interested person boasted to a senator, about\r\n1860, that \"twelve vessels would discharge their living freight upon our\r\nshores within ninety days from the 1st of June last,\" and that between\r\nsixty and seventy cargoes had been successfully introduced in the last\r\neighteen months.[52] The New York _Tribune_ doubted the statement; but\r\nJohn C. Underwood, formerly of Virginia, wrote to the paper saying that\r\nhe was satisfied that the correspondent was correct. \"I have,\" he said,\r\n\"had ample evidences of the fact, that reopening the African Slave-trade\r\nis a thing already accomplished, and the traffic is brisk, and rapidly\r\nincreasing. In fact, the most vital question of the day is not the\r\nopening of this trade, but its suppression. The arrival of cargoes of\r\nnegroes, fresh from Africa, in our southern ports, is an event of\r\nfrequent occurrence.\"[53]\r\n\r\nNegroes, newly landed, were openly advertised for sale in the public\r\npress, and bids for additional importations made. In reply to one of\r\nthese, the Mobile _Mercury_ facetiously remarks: \"Some negroes who never\r\nlearned to talk English, went up the railroad the other day.\"[54]\r\nCongressmen declared on the floor of the House: \"The slave trade may\r\ntherefore be regarded as practically re-established;\"[55] and petitions\r\nlike that from the American Missionary Society recited the fact that\r\n\"this piratical and illegal trade--this inhuman invasion of the rights\r\nof men,--this outrage on civilization and Christianity--this violation\r\nof the laws of God and man--is openly countenanced and encouraged by a\r\nportion of the citizens of some of the States of this Union.\"[56]\r\n\r\nFrom such evidence it seems clear that the slave-trade laws, in spite of\r\nthe efforts of the government, in spite even of much opposition to these\r\nextra-legal methods in the South itself, were grossly violated, if not\r\nnearly nullified, in the latter part of the decade 1850-1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. ~Apathy of the Federal Government.~ During the decade there was some\r\nattempt at reactionary legislation, chiefly directed at the Treaty of\r\nWashington. June 13, 1854, Slidell, from the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations, made an elaborate report to the Senate, advocating the\r\nabrogation of the 8th Article of that treaty, on the ground that it was\r\ncostly, fatal to the health of the sailors, and useless, as the trade\r\nhad actually increased under its operation.[57] Both this and a similar\r\nattempt in the House failed,[58] as did also an attempt to substitute\r\nlife imprisonment for the death penalty.[59] Most of the actual\r\nlegislation naturally took the form of appropriations. In 1853 there was\r\nan attempt to appropriate $20,000.[60] This failed, and the\r\nappropriation of $8,000 in 1856 was the first for ten years.[61] The\r\nfollowing year brought a similar appropriation,[62] and in 1859[63] and\r\n1860[64] $75,000 and $40,000 respectively were appropriated. Of\r\nattempted legislation to strengthen the laws there was plenty: e.g.,\r\npropositions to regulate the issue of sea-letters and the use of our\r\nflag;[65] to prevent the \"coolie\" trade, or the bringing in of\r\n\"apprentices\" or \"African laborers;\"[66] to stop the coastwise\r\ntrade;[67] to assent to a Right of Search;[68] and to amend the\r\nConstitution by forever prohibiting the slave-trade.[69]\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the executive during this period were criminally lax and\r\nnegligent. \"The General Government did not exert itself in good faith to\r\ncarry out either its treaty stipulations or the legislation of Congress\r\nin regard to the matter. If a vessel was captured, her owners were\r\npermitted to bond her, and thus continue her in the trade; and if any\r\nman was convicted of this form of piracy, the executive always\r\ninterposed between him and the penalty of his crime. The laws providing\r\nfor the seizure of vessels engaged in the traffic were so constructed as\r\nto render the duty unremunerative; and marshals now find their fees for\r\nsuch services to be actually less than their necessary expenses. No one\r\nwho bears this fact in mind will be surprised at the great indifference\r\nof these officers to the continuing of the slave-trade; in fact, he will\r\nbe ready to learn that the laws of Congress upon the subject had become\r\na dead letter, and that the suspicion was well grounded that certain\r\nofficers of the Federal Government had actually connived at their\r\nviolation.\"[70] From 1845 to 1854, in spite of the well-known activity\r\nof the trade, but five cases obtained cognizance in the New York\r\ndistrict. Of these, Captains Mansfield and Driscoll forfeited their\r\nbonds of $5,000 each, and escaped; in the case of the notorious Canot,\r\nnothing had been done as late as 1856, although he was arrested in 1847;\r\nCaptain Jefferson turned State's evidence, and, in the case of Captain\r\nMathew, a _nolle prosequi_ was entered.[71] Between 1854 and 1856\r\nthirty-two persons were indicted in New York, of whom only thirteen had\r\nat the latter date been tried, and only one of these convicted.[72]\r\nThese dismissals were seldom on account of insufficient evidence. In the\r\nnotorious case of the \"Wanderer,\" she was arrested on suspicion,\r\nreleased, and soon after she landed a cargo of slaves in Georgia; some\r\nwho attempted to seize the Negroes were arrested for larceny, and in\r\nspite of the efforts of Congress the captain was never punished. The\r\nyacht was afterwards started on another voyage, and being brought back\r\nto Boston was sold to her former owner for about one third her\r\nvalue.[73] The bark \"Emily\" was seized on suspicion and released, and\r\nfinally caught red-handed on the coast of Africa; she was sent to New\r\nYork for trial, but \"disappeared\" under a certain slave captain,\r\nTownsend, who had, previous to this, in the face of the most convincing\r\nevidence, been acquitted at Key West.[74]\r\n\r\nThe squadron commanders of this time were by no means as efficient as\r\ntheir predecessors, and spent much of their time, apparently, in\r\ndiscussing the Right of Search. Instead of a number of small light\r\nvessels, which by the reports of experts were repeatedly shown to be the\r\nonly efficient craft, the government, until 1859, persisted in sending\r\nout three or four great frigates. Even these did not attend faithfully\r\nto their duties. A letter from on board one of them shows that, out of a\r\nfifteen months' alleged service, only twenty-two days were spent on the\r\nusual cruising-ground for slavers, and thirteen of these at anchor;\r\neleven months were spent at Madeira and Cape Verde Islands, 300 miles\r\nfrom the coast and 3,000 miles from the slave market.[75] British\r\ncommanders report the apathy of American officers and the extreme\r\ncaution of their instructions, which allowed many slavers to escape.[76]\r\n\r\nThe officials at Washington often remained in blissful, and perhaps\r\nwilling, ignorance of the state of the trade. While Americans were\r\nsmuggling slaves by the thousands into Brazil, and by the hundreds into\r\nthe United States, Secretary Graham was recommending the abrogation of\r\nthe 8th Article of the Treaty of Washington;[77] so, too, when the Cuban\r\nslave-trade was reaching unprecedented activity, and while slavers were\r\nbeing fitted out in every port on the Atlantic seaboard, Secretary\r\nKennedy naïvely reports, \"The time has come, perhaps, when it may be\r\nproperly commended to the notice of Congress to inquire into the\r\nnecessity of further continuing the regular employment of a squadron on\r\nthis [i.e., the African] coast.\"[78] Again, in 1855, the government has\r\n\"advices that the slave trade south of the equator is entirely broken\r\nup;\"[79] in 1856, the reports are \"favorable;\"[80] in 1857 a British\r\ncommander writes: \"No vessel has been seen here for one year, certainly;\r\nI think for nearly three years there have been no American cruizers on\r\nthese waters, where a valuable and extensive American commerce is\r\ncarried on. I cannot, therefore, but think that this continued absence\r\nof foreign cruizers looks as if they were intentionally withdrawn, and\r\nas if the Government did not care to take measures to prevent the\r\nAmerican flag being used to cover Slave Trade transactions;\"[81]\r\nnevertheless, in this same year, according to Secretary Toucey, \"the\r\nforce on the coast of Africa has fully accomplished its main\r\nobject.\"[82] Finally, in the same month in which the \"Wanderer\" and her\r\nmates were openly landing cargoes in the South, President Buchanan, who\r\nseems to have been utterly devoid of a sense of humor, was urging the\r\nannexation of Cuba to the United States as the only method of\r\nsuppressing the slave-trade![83]\r\n\r\nAbout 1859 the frequent and notorious violations of our laws aroused\r\neven the Buchanan government; a larger appropriation was obtained, swift\r\nlight steamers were employed, and, though we may well doubt whether\r\nafter such a carnival illegal importations \"entirely\" ceased, as the\r\nPresident informed Congress,[84] yet some sincere efforts at suppression\r\nwere certainly begun. From 1850 to 1859 we have few notices of captured\r\nslavers, but in 1860 the increased appropriation of the thirty-fifth\r\nCongress resulted in the capture of twelve vessels with 3,119\r\nAfricans.[85] The Act of June 16, 1860, enabled the President to\r\ncontract with the Colonization Society for the return of recaptured\r\nAfricans; and by a long-needed arrangement cruisers were to proceed\r\ndirect to Africa with such cargoes, instead of first landing them in\r\nthis country.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\n90. ~Attitude of the Southern Confederacy.~ The attempt, initiated by\r\nthe constitutional fathers, to separate the problem of slavery from that\r\nof the slave-trade had, after a trial of half a century, signally\r\nfailed, and for well-defined economic reasons. The nation had at last\r\ncome to the parting of the ways, one of which led to a free-labor\r\nsystem, the other to a slave system fed by the slave-trade. Both\r\nsections of the country naturally hesitated at the cross-roads: the\r\nNorth clung to the delusion that a territorially limited system of\r\nslavery, without a slave-trade, was still possible in the South; the\r\nSouth hesitated to fight for her logical object--slavery and free trade\r\nin Negroes--and, in her moral and economic dilemma, sought to make\r\nautonomy and the Constitution her object. The real line of contention\r\nwas, however, fixed by years of development, and was unalterable by the\r\npresent whims or wishes of the contestants, no matter how important or\r\ninteresting these might be: the triumph of the North meant free labor;\r\nthe triumph of the South meant slavery and the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if many of the Southern leaders ever deceived themselves\r\nby thinking that Southern slavery, as it then was, could long be\r\nmaintained without a general or a partial reopening of the slave-trade.\r\nMany had openly declared this a few years before, and there was no\r\nreason for a change of opinion. Nevertheless, at the outbreak of actual\r\nwar and secession, there were powerful and decisive reasons for\r\nrelegating the question temporarily to the rear. In the first place,\r\nonly by this means could the adherence of important Border States be\r\nsecured, without the aid of which secession was folly. Secondly, while\r\nit did no harm to laud the independence of the South and the kingship of\r\ncotton in \"stump\" speeches and conventions, yet, when it came to actual\r\nhostilities, the South sorely needed the aid of Europe; and this a\r\nnation fighting for slavery and the slave-trade stood poor chance of\r\ngetting. Consequently, after attacking the slave-trade laws for a\r\ndecade, and their execution for a quarter-century, we find the Southern\r\nleaders inserting, in both the provisional and the permanent\r\nConstitutions of the Confederate States, the following article:--\r\n\r\n    The importation of negroes of the African race, from any foreign\r\n    country other than the slaveholding States or Territories of the\r\n    United States of America, is hereby forbidden; and Congress is\r\n    required to pass such laws as shall effectually prevent the\r\n    same.\r\n\r\n    Congress shall also have power to prohibit the introduction of\r\n    slaves from any State not a member of, or Territory not\r\n    belonging to, this Confederacy.[87]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Confederate government toward this article is best\r\nillustrated by its circular of instructions to its foreign ministers:--\r\n\r\n    It has been suggested to this Government, from a source of\r\n    unquestioned authenticity, that, after the recognition of our\r\n    independence by the European Powers, an expectation is generally\r\n    entertained by them that in our treaties of amity and commerce a\r\n    clause will be introduced making stipulations against the\r\n    African slave trade. It is even thought that neutral Powers may\r\n    be inclined to insist upon the insertion of such a clause as a\r\n    _sine qua non_.\r\n\r\n    You are well aware how firmly fixed in our Constitution is the\r\n    policy of this Confederacy against the opening of that trade,\r\n    but we are informed that false and insidious suggestions have\r\n    been made by the agents of the United States at European Courts\r\n    of our intention to change our constitution as soon as peace is\r\n    restored, and of authorizing the importation of slaves from\r\n    Africa. If, therefore, you should find, in your intercourse with\r\n    the Cabinet to which you are accredited, that any such\r\n    impressions are entertained, you will use every proper effort to\r\n    remove them, and if an attempt is made to introduce into any\r\n    treaty which you may be charged with negotiating stipulations on\r\n    the subject just mentioned, you will assume, in behalf of your\r\n    Government, the position which, under the direction of the\r\n    President, I now proceed to develop.\r\n\r\n    The Constitution of the Confederate States is an agreement made\r\n    between independent States. By its terms all the powers of\r\n    Government are separated into classes as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    1st. Such powers as the States delegate to the General\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    2d. Such powers as the States agree to refrain from exercising,\r\n    although they do not delegate them to the General Government.\r\n\r\n    3d. Such powers as the States, without delegating them to the\r\n    General Government, thought proper to exercise by direct\r\n    agreement between themselves contained in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    4th. All remaining powers of sovereignty, which not being\r\n    delegated to the Confederate States by the Constitution nor\r\n    prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\r\n    respectively, or to the people thereof.... Especially in\r\n    relation to the importation of African negroes was it deemed\r\n    important by the States that no power to permit it should exist\r\n    in the Confederate Government.... It will thus be seen that no\r\n    power is delegated to the Confederate Government over this\r\n    subject, but that it is included in the third class above\r\n    referred to, of powers exercised directly by the States.... This\r\n    Government unequivocally and absolutely denies its possession of\r\n    any power whatever over the subject, and cannot entertain any\r\n    proposition in relation to it.... The policy of the Confederacy\r\n    is as fixed and immutable on this subject as the imperfection of\r\n    human nature permits human resolve to be. No additional\r\n    agreements, treaties, or stipulations can commit these States to\r\n    the prohibition of the African slave trade with more binding\r\n    efficacy than those they have themselves devised. A just and\r\n    generous confidence in their good faith on this subject\r\n    exhibited by friendly Powers will be far more efficacious than\r\n    persistent efforts to induce this Government to assume the\r\n    exercise of powers which it does not possess.... We trust,\r\n    therefore, that no unnecessary discussions on this matter will\r\n    be introduced into your negotiations. If, unfortunately, this\r\n    reliance should prove ill-founded, you will decline continuing\r\n    negotiations on your side, and transfer them to us at\r\n    home....[88]\r\n\r\nThis attitude of the conservative leaders of the South, if it meant\r\nanything, meant that individual State action could, when it pleased,\r\nreopen the slave-trade. The radicals were, of course, not satisfied with\r\nany veiling of the ulterior purpose of the new slave republic, and\r\nattacked the constitutional provision violently. \"If,\" said one, \"the\r\nclause be carried into the permanent government, our whole movement is\r\ndefeated. It will abolitionize the Border Slave States--it will brand\r\nour institution. Slavery cannot share a government with Democracy,--it\r\ncannot bear a brand upon it; thence another revolution ... having\r\nachieved one revolution to escape democracy at the North, it must still\r\nachieve another to escape it at the South. That it will ultimately\r\ntriumph none can doubt.\"[89]\r\n\r\n91. ~Attitude of the United States.~ In the North, with all the\r\nhesitation in many matters, there existed unanimity in regard to the\r\nslave-trade; and the new Lincoln government ushered in the new policy of\r\nuncompromising suppression by hanging the first American slave-trader\r\nwho ever suffered the extreme penalty of the law.[90] One of the\r\nearliest acts of President Lincoln was a step which had been necessary\r\nsince 1808, but had never been taken, viz., the unification of the whole\r\nwork of suppression into the hands of one responsible department. By an\r\norder, dated May 2, 1861, Caleb B. Smith, Secretary of the Interior, was\r\ncharged with the execution of the slave-trade laws,[91] and he\r\nimmediately began energetic work. Early in 1861, as soon as the\r\nwithdrawal of the Southern members untied the hands of Congress, two\r\nappropriations of $900,000 each were made to suppress the slave trade,\r\nthe first appropriations commensurate with the vastness of the task.\r\nThese were followed by four appropriations of $17,000 each in the years\r\n1863 to 1867, and two of $12,500 each in 1868 and 1869.[92] The first\r\nwork of the new secretary was to obtain a corps of efficient assistants.\r\nTo this end, he assembled all the marshals of the loyal seaboard States\r\nat New York, and gave them instruction and opportunity to inspect\r\nactual slavers. Congress also, for the first time, offered them proper\r\ncompensation.[93] The next six months showed the effect of this policy\r\nin the fact that five vessels were seized and condemned, and four\r\nslave-traders were convicted and suffered the penalty of their crimes.\r\n\"This is probably the largest number [of convictions] ever obtained, and\r\ncertainly the only ones for many years.\"[94]\r\n\r\nMeantime the government opened negotiations with Great Britain, and the\r\ntreaty of 1862 was signed June 7, and carried out by Act of Congress,\r\nJuly 11.[95] Specially commissioned war vessels of either government\r\nwere by this agreement authorized to search merchant vessels on the high\r\nseas and specified coasts, and if they were found to be slavers, or, on\r\naccount of their construction or equipment, were suspected to be such,\r\nthey were to be sent for condemnation to one of the mixed courts\r\nestablished at New York, Sierra Leone, and the Cape of Good Hope. These\r\ncourts, consisting of one judge and one arbitrator on the part of each\r\ngovernment, were to judge the facts without appeal, and upon\r\ncondemnation by them, the culprits were to be punished according to the\r\nlaws of their respective countries. The area in which this Right of\r\nSearch could be exercised was somewhat enlarged by an additional article\r\nto the treaty, signed in 1863. In 1870 the mixed courts were abolished,\r\nbut the main part of the treaty was left in force. The Act of July 17,\r\n1862, enabled the President to contract with foreign governments for the\r\napprenticing of recaptured Africans in the West Indies,[96] and in 1864\r\nthe coastwise slave-trade was forever prohibited.[97] By these measures\r\nthe trade was soon checked, and before the end of the war entirely\r\nsuppressed.[98] The vigilance of the government, however, was not\r\nchecked, and as late as 1866 a squadron of ten ships, with one hundred\r\nand thirteen guns, patrolled the slave coast.[99] Finally, the\r\nThirteenth Amendment legally confirmed what the war had already\r\naccomplished, and slavery and the slave-trade fell at one blow.[100]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] _British and Foreign State Papers_, 1854-5, p. 1156.\r\n\r\n  [2] Cluskey, _Political Text-Book_ (14th ed.), p. 585.\r\n\r\n  [3] _De Bow's Review_, XXII. 223; quoted from Andrew Hunter of\r\n      Virginia.\r\n\r\n  [4] _Ibid._, XVIII. 628.\r\n\r\n  [5] _Ibid._, XXII. 91, 102, 217, 221-2.\r\n\r\n  [6] From a pamphlet entitled \"A New Southern Policy, or the\r\n      Slave Trade as meaning Union and Conservatism;\" quoted in\r\n      Etheridge's speech, Feb. 21, 1857: _Congressional Globe_, 34\r\n      Cong. 3 sess., Appendix, p. 366.\r\n\r\n  [7] _De Bow's Review_, XXIII. 298-320.

The Lesson for Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n92. ~How the Question Arose.~ We have followed a chapter of history\r\nwhich is of peculiar interest to the sociologist. Here was a rich new\r\nland, the wealth of which was to be had in return for ordinary manual\r\nlabor. Had the country been conceived of as existing primarily for the\r\nbenefit of its actual inhabitants, it might have waited for natural\r\nincrease or immigration to supply the needed hands; but both Europe and\r\nthe earlier colonists themselves regarded this land as existing chiefly\r\nfor the benefit of Europe, and as designed to be exploited, as rapidly\r\nand ruthlessly as possible, of the boundless wealth of its resources.\r\nThis was the primary excuse for the rise of the African slave-trade to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nEvery experiment of such a kind, however, where the moral standard of a\r\npeople is lowered for the sake of a material advantage, is dangerous in\r\njust such proportion as that advantage is great. In this case it was\r\ngreat. For at least a century, in the West Indies and the southern\r\nUnited States, agriculture flourished, trade increased, and English\r\nmanufactures were nourished, in just such proportion as Americans stole\r\nNegroes and worked them to death. This advantage, to be sure, became\r\nmuch smaller in later times, and at one critical period was, at least in\r\nthe Southern States, almost _nil_; but energetic efforts were wanting,\r\nand, before the nation was aware, slavery had seized a new and well-nigh\r\nimmovable footing in the Cotton Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe colonists averred with perfect truth that they did not commence this\r\nfatal traffic, but that it was imposed upon them from without.\r\nNevertheless, all too soon did they lay aside scruples against it and\r\nhasten to share its material benefits. Even those who braved the rough\r\nAtlantic for the highest moral motives fell early victims to the\r\nallurements of this system. Thus, throughout colonial history, in spite\r\nof many honest attempts to stop the further pursuit of the slave-trade,\r\nwe notice back of nearly all such attempts a certain moral apathy, an\r\nindisposition to attack the evil with the sharp weapons which its nature\r\ndemanded. Consequently, there developed steadily, irresistibly, a vast\r\nsocial problem, which required two centuries and a half for a nation of\r\ntrained European stock and boasted moral fibre to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\n93. ~The Moral Movement.~ For the solution of this problem there were,\r\nroughly speaking, three classes of efforts made during this\r\ntime,--moral, political, and economic: that is to say, efforts which\r\nsought directly to raise the moral standard of the nation; efforts which\r\nsought to stop the trade by legal enactment; efforts which sought to\r\nneutralize the economic advantages of the slave-trade. There is always a\r\ncertain glamour about the idea of a nation rising up to crush an evil\r\nsimply because it is wrong. Unfortunately, this can seldom be realized\r\nin real life; for the very existence of the evil usually argues a moral\r\nweakness in the very place where extraordinary moral strength is called\r\nfor. This was the case in the early history of the colonies; and\r\nexperience proved that an appeal to moral rectitude was unheard in\r\nCarolina when rice had become a great crop, and in Massachusetts when\r\nthe rum-slave-traffic was paying a profit of 100%. That the various\r\nabolition societies and anti-slavery movements did heroic work in\r\nrousing the national conscience is certainly true; unfortunately,\r\nhowever, these movements were weakest at the most critical times. When,\r\nin 1774 and 1804, the material advantages of the slave-trade and the\r\ninstitution of slavery were least, it seemed possible that moral suasion\r\nmight accomplish the abolition of both. A fatal spirit of temporizing,\r\nhowever, seized the nation at these points; and although the slave-trade\r\nwas, largely for political reasons, forbidden, slavery was left\r\nuntouched. Beyond this point, as years rolled by, it was found well-nigh\r\nimpossible to rouse the moral sense of the nation. Even in the matter of\r\nenforcing its own laws and co-operating with the civilized world, a\r\nlethargy seized the country, and it did not awake until slavery was\r\nabout to destroy it. Even then, after a long and earnest crusade, the\r\nnational sense of right did not rise to the entire abolition of\r\nslavery. It was only a peculiar and almost fortuitous commingling of\r\nmoral, political, and economic motives that eventually crushed African\r\nslavery and its handmaid, the slave-trade in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n94. ~The Political Movement.~ The political efforts to limit the\r\nslave-trade were the outcome partly of moral reprobation of the trade,\r\npartly of motives of expediency. This legislation was never such as wise\r\nand powerful rulers may make for a nation, with the ulterior purpose of\r\ncalling in the respect which the nation has for law to aid in raising\r\nits standard of right. The colonial and national laws on the slave-trade\r\nmerely registered, from time to time, the average public opinion\r\nconcerning this traffic, and are therefore to be regarded as negative\r\nsigns rather than as positive efforts. These signs were, from one point\r\nof view, evidences of moral awakening; they indicated slow, steady\r\ndevelopment of the idea that to steal even Negroes was wrong. From\r\nanother point of view, these laws showed the fear of servile\r\ninsurrection and the desire to ward off danger from the State; again,\r\nthey often indicated a desire to appear well before the civilized world,\r\nand to rid the \"land of the free\" of the paradox of slavery.\r\nRepresenting such motives, the laws varied all the way from mere\r\nregulating acts to absolute prohibitions. On the whole, these acts were\r\npoorly conceived, loosely drawn, and wretchedly enforced. The systematic\r\nviolation of the provisions of many of them led to a widespread belief\r\nthat enforcement was, in the nature of the case, impossible; and thus,\r\ninstead of marking ground already won, they were too often sources of\r\ndistinct moral deterioration. Certainly the carnival of lawlessness that\r\nsucceeded the Act of 1807, and that which preceded final suppression in\r\n1861, were glaring examples of the failure of the efforts to suppress\r\nthe slave-trade by mere law.\r\n\r\n\r\n95. ~The Economic Movement.~ Economic measures against the trade were\r\nthose which from the beginning had the best chance of success, but which\r\nwere least tried. They included tariff measures; efforts to encourage\r\nthe immigration of free laborers and the emigration of the slaves;\r\nmeasures for changing the character of Southern industry; and, finally,\r\nplans to restore the economic balance which slavery destroyed, by\r\nraising the condition of the slave to that of complete freedom and\r\nresponsibility. Like the political efforts, these rested in part on a\r\nmoral basis; and, as legal enactments, they were also themselves often\r\npolitical measures. They differed, however, from purely moral and\r\npolitical efforts, in having as a main motive the economic gain which a\r\nsubstitution of free for slave labor promised.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of such efforts was the revenue duty on slaves that\r\nexisted in all the colonies. This developed into the prohibitive tariff,\r\nand into measures encouraging immigration or industrial improvements.\r\nThe colonization movement was another form of these efforts; it was\r\ninadequately conceived, and not altogether sincere, but it had a sound,\r\nalthough in this case impracticable, economic basis. The one great\r\nmeasure which finally stopped the slave-trade forever was, naturally,\r\nthe abolition of slavery, i.e., the giving to the Negro the right to\r\nsell his labor at a price consistent with his own welfare. The abolition\r\nof slavery itself, while due in part to direct moral appeal and\r\npolitical sagacity, was largely the result of the economic collapse of\r\nthe large-farming slave system.\r\n\r\n\r\n96. ~The Lesson for Americans.~ It may be doubted if ever before such\r\npolitical mistakes as the slavery compromises of the Constitutional\r\nConvention had such serious results, and yet, by a succession of\r\nunexpected accidents, still left a nation in position to work out its\r\ndestiny. No American can study the connection of slavery with United\r\nStates history, and not devoutly pray that his country may never have a\r\nsimilar social problem to solve, until it shows more capacity for such\r\nwork than it has shown in the past. It is neither profitable nor in\r\naccordance with scientific truth to consider that whatever the\r\nconstitutional fathers did was right, or that slavery was a plague sent\r\nfrom God and fated to be eliminated in due time. We must face the fact\r\nthat this problem arose principally from the cupidity and carelessness\r\nof our ancestors. It was the plain duty of the colonies to crush the\r\ntrade and the system in its infancy: they preferred to enrich themselves\r\non its profits. It was the plain duty of a Revolution based upon\r\n\"Liberty\" to take steps toward the abolition of slavery: it preferred\r\npromises to straightforward action. It was the plain duty of the\r\nConstitutional Convention, in founding a new nation, to compromise with\r\na threatening social evil only in case its settlement would thereby be\r\npostponed to a more favorable time: this was not the case in the slavery\r\nand the slave-trade compromises; there never was a time in the history\r\nof America when the system had a slighter economic, political, and moral\r\njustification than in 1787; and yet with this real, existent, growing\r\nevil before their eyes, a bargain largely of dollars and cents was\r\nallowed to open the highway that led straight to the Civil War.\r\nMoreover, it was due to no wisdom and foresight on the part of the\r\nfathers that fortuitous circumstances made the result of that war what\r\nit was, nor was it due to exceptional philanthropy on the part of their\r\ndescendants that that result included the abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nWith the faith of the nation broken at the very outset, the system of\r\nslavery untouched, and twenty years' respite given to the slave-trade to\r\nfeed and foster it, there began, with 1787, that system of bargaining,\r\ntruckling, and compromising with a moral, political, and economic\r\nmonstrosity, which makes the history of our dealing with slavery in the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century so discreditable to a great people.\r\nEach generation sought to shift its load upon the next, and the burden\r\nrolled on, until a generation came which was both too weak and too\r\nstrong to bear it longer. One cannot, to be sure, demand of whole\r\nnations exceptional moral foresight and heroism; but a certain hard\r\ncommon-sense in facing the complicated phenomena of political life must\r\nbe expected in every progressive people. In some respects we as a nation\r\nseem to lack this; we have the somewhat inchoate idea that we are not\r\ndestined to be harassed with great social questions, and that even if we\r\nare, and fail to answer them, the fault is with the question and not\r\nwith us. Consequently we often congratulate ourselves more on getting\r\nrid of a problem than on solving it. Such an attitude is dangerous; we\r\nhave and shall have, as other peoples have had, critical, momentous, and\r\npressing questions to answer. The riddle of the Sphinx may be postponed,\r\nit may be evasively answered now; sometime it must be fully answered.\r\n\r\nIt behooves the United States, therefore, in the interest both of\r\nscientific truth and of future social reform, carefully to study such\r\nchapters of her history as that of the suppression of the slave-trade.\r\nThe most obvious question which this study suggests is: How far in a\r\nState can a recognized moral wrong safely be compromised? And although\r\nthis chapter of history can give us no definite answer suited to the\r\never-varying aspects of political life, yet it would seem to warn any\r\nnation from allowing, through carelessness and moral cowardice, any\r\nsocial evil to grow. No persons would have seen the Civil War with more\r\nsurprise and horror than the Revolutionists of 1776; yet from the small\r\nand apparently dying institution of their day arose the walled and\r\ncastled Slave-Power. From this we may conclude that it behooves nations\r\nas well as men to do things at the very moment when they ought to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nA CHRONOLOGICAL CONSPECTUS OF COLONIAL AND STATE LEGISLATION RESTRICTING\r\nTHE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE. 1641-1787.\r\n\r\n\r\n~1641.

They must feel, at the same\r\ntime, the greater solicitude to give the fullest efficacy to their own\r\nregulations. With that view, the interposition of Congress appears to be\r\nrequired by the violations and evasions which, it is suggested, are\r\nchargeable on unworthy citizens, who mingle in the slave trade under\r\nforeign flags, and with foreign ports; and by collusive importations of\r\nslaves into the United States, through adjoining ports and territories.\r\nI present the subject to Congress, with a full assurance of their\r\ndisposition to apply all the remedy which can be afforded by an\r\namendment of the law.

The vessel shall be taken for trial to the country\r\nwhere she belongs.\r\n\r\nArt. II. Provides that even if the vessel seized does not belong to a\r\ncitizen or citizens of either of the two contracting parties, but is\r\nchartered by them, she may be seized in the same way as if she belonged\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nArt. III. Requires that in all cases where any vessel of either party\r\nshall be boarded by any naval officer of the other party, on suspicion\r\nof being concerned in the slave-trade, the officer shall deliver to the\r\ncaptain of the vessel so boarded a certificate in writing, signed by the\r\nnaval officer, specifying his rank, etc., and the object of his visit.\r\nProvision is made for the delivery of ships and papers to the tribunal\r\nbefore which they are brought.\r\n\r\nArt. IV. Limits the Right of Search, recognized by the Convention, to\r\nsuch investigation as shall be necessary to ascertain the fact whether\r\nthe said vessel is or is not engaged in the slave-trade. No person shall\r\nbe taken out of the vessel so visited unless for reasons of health.\r\n\r\nArt. V. Makes it the duty of the commander of either nation, having\r\ncaptured a vessel of the other under the treaty, to receive unto his\r\ncustody the vessel captured, and send or carry it into some port of the\r\nvessel's own country for adjudication, in which case triplicate\r\ndeclarations are to be signed, etc.\r\n\r\nArt. VI.

VII. Provides that the commander and crew of the captured vessel\r\nshall be proceeded against as pirates, in the ports to which they are\r\nbrought, etc.\r\n\r\nArt. VIII. Confines the Right of Search, under this treaty, to such\r\nofficers of both parties as are especially authorized to execute the\r\nlaws of their countries in regard to the slave-trade.

XI. Provides that the ratifications of the treaty shall be\r\nexchanged at London within twelve months, or as much sooner as possible.\r\nSigned by Mr. Rush, Minister to the Court of St. James, March 13, 1824.\r\n\r\nThe above is a synopsis of the treaty as it was laid before the Senate.\r\nIt was ratified by the Senate with certain conditions, one of which was\r\nthat the duration of this treaty should be limited to the pleasure of\r\nthe two parties on six months' notice; another was that the Right of\r\nSearch should be limited to the African and West Indian seas: i.e., the\r\nword \"America\" was struck out. This treaty as amended and passed by the\r\nSenate (cf. above, p. 141) was rejected by Great Britain. A counter\r\nproject was suggested by her, but not accepted (cf. above, p. 144).

President Monroe's Message.~\r\n\r\n\"It is a cause of serious regret, that no arrangement has yet been\r\nfinally concluded between the two Governments, to secure, by joint\r\nco-operation, the suppression of the slave trade. It was the object of\r\nthe British Government, in the early stages of the negotiation, to adopt\r\na plan for the suppression, which should include the concession of the\r\nmutual right of search by the ships of war of each party, of the\r\nvessels of the other, for suspected offenders. This was objected to by\r\nthis Government, on the principle that, as the right of search was a\r\nright of war of a belligerant towards a neutral power, it might have an\r\nill effect to extend it, by treaty, to an offence which had been made\r\ncomparatively mild, to a time of peace. Anxious, however, for the\r\nsuppression of this trade, it was thought adviseable, in compliance with\r\na resolution of the House of Representatives, founded on an act of\r\nCongress, to propose to the British Government an expedient, which\r\nshould be free from that objection, and more effectual for the object,\r\nby making it piratical.... A convention to this effect was concluded and\r\nsigned, in London,\" on the 13th of March, 1824, \"by plenipotentiaries\r\nduly authorized by both Governments, to the ratification of which\r\ncertain obstacles have arisen, which are not yet entirely removed.\" [For\r\nthe removal of which, the documents relating to the negotiation are\r\nsubmitted for the action of Congress]....\r\n\r\n\"In execution of the laws for the suppression of the slave trade, a\r\nvessel has been occasionally sent from that squadron to the coast of\r\nAfrica, with orders to return thence by the usual track of the slave\r\nships, and to seize any of our vessels which might be engaged in that\r\ntrade. None have been found, and, it is believed, that none are thus\r\nemployed. It is well known, however, that the trade still exists under\r\nother flags.\" _House Journal_, 18 Cong. 2 sess. pp. 11, 12, 19, 27, 241;\r\n_House Reports_, 18 Cong. 2 sess. I.

There is\r\nreason to believe that the traffic is on the increase. Whether such\r\nincrease is to be ascribed to the abolition of slave labor in the\r\nBritish possessions in our vicinity, and an attendant diminution in the\r\nsupply of those articles which enter into the general consumption of the\r\nworld, thereby augmenting the demand from other quarters, ... it were\r\nneedless to inquire.

President Tyler's Message.~\r\n\r\nThough the United States is desirous to suppress the slave-trade, she\r\nwill not submit to interpolations into the maritime code at will by\r\nother nations. This government has expressed its repugnance to the trade\r\nby several laws. It is a matter for deliberation whether we will enter\r\nupon treaties containing mutual stipulations upon the subject with other\r\ngovernments. The United States will demand indemnity for all\r\ndepredations by Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"I invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the\r\nAfrican slave trade, and recommend all such alterations as may give to\r\nthem greater force and efficacy. That the American flag is grossly\r\nabused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations is but too\r\nprobable.

Right of Search: Cass's Protest.~\r\n\r\nCass writes to Webster, that, considering the fact that the signing of\r\nthe Quintuple Treaty would oblige the participants to exercise the Right\r\nof Search denied by the United States, or to make a change in the\r\nhitherto recognized law of nations, he, on his own responsibility,\r\naddressed the following protest to the French Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, M. Guizot:--\r\n\r\n                                       \"LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n                                            \"PARIS, FEBRUARY 13, 1842.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: The recent signature of a treaty, having for its object\r\nthe suppression of the African slave trade, by five of the powers of\r\nEurope, and to which France is a party, is a fact of such general\r\nnotoriety that it may be assumed as the basis of any diplomatic\r\nrepresentations which the subject may fairly require.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States is no party to this treaty. She denies the Right of\r\nVisitation which England asserts. [Quotes from the presidential message\r\nof Dec. 7, 1841.] This principle is asserted by the treaty.\r\n\r\n\" ... The moral effect which such a union of five great powers, two of\r\nwhich are eminently maritime, but three of which have perhaps never had\r\na vessel engaged in that traffic, is calculated to produce upon the\r\nUnited States, and upon other nations who, like them, may be indisposed\r\nto these combined movements, though it may be regretted, yet furnishes\r\nno just cause of complaint. But the subject assumes another aspect when\r\nthey are told by one of the parties that their vessels are to be\r\nforcibly entered and examined, in order to carry into effect these\r\nstipulations. Certainly the American Government does not believe that\r\nthe high powers, contracting parties to this treaty, have any wish to\r\ncompel the United States, by force, to adopt their measures to its\r\nprovisions, or to adopt its stipulations ...; and they will see with\r\npleasure the prompt disavowal made by yourself, sir, in the name of your\r\ncountry, ... of any intentions of this nature. But were it otherwise,\r\n... They would prepare themselves with apprehension, indeed, but without\r\ndismay--with regret, but with firmness--for one of those desperate\r\nstruggles which have sometimes occurred in the history of the world.\"\r\n\r\nIf, as England says, these treaties cannot be executed without visiting\r\nUnited States ships, then France must pursue the same course. It is\r\nhoped, therefore, that his Majesty will, before signing this treaty,\r\ncarefully examine the pretensions of England and their compatibility\r\nwith the law of nations and the honor of the United States. _Senate\r\nDoc._, 27 Cong. 3 sess.

South Carolina: Governor's Message.~\r\n\r\nGovernor Adams, in his annual message to the legislature, said:--\r\n\r\n\"It is apprehended that the opening of this trade [_i.e._, the\r\nslave-trade] will lessen the value of slaves, and ultimately destroy the\r\ninstitution. It is a sufficient answer to point to the fact, that\r\nunrestricted immigration has not diminished the value of labor in the\r\nNorthwestern section of the confederacy. The cry there is, want of\r\nlabor, notwithstanding capital has the pauperism of the old world to\r\npress into its grinding service. If we cannot supply the demand for\r\nslave labor, then we must expect to be supplied with a species of labor\r\nwe do not want, and which is, from the very nature of things,\r\nantagonistic to our institutions. It is much better that our drays\r\nshould be driven by slaves--that our factories should be worked by\r\nslaves--that our hotels should be served by slaves--that our locomotives\r\nshould be manned by slaves, than that we should be exposed to the\r\nintroduction, from any quarter, of a population alien to us by birth,\r\ntraining, and education, and which, in the process of time, must lead to\r\nthat conflict between capital and labor, 'which makes it so difficult to\r\nmaintain free institutions in all wealthy and highly civilized nations\r\nwhere such institutions as ours do not exist.' In all slaveholding\r\nStates, true policy dictates that the superior race should direct, and\r\nthe inferior perform all menial service.

President Buchanan's Message.~\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, that Cuba in its existing colonial condition, is a\r\nconstant source of injury and annoyance to the American people. It is\r\nthe only spot in the civilized world where the African slave trade is\r\ntolerated; and we are bound by treaty with Great Britain to maintain a\r\nnaval force on the coast of Africa, at much expense both of life and\r\ntreasure, solely for the purpose of arresting slavers bound to that\r\nisland. The late serious difficulties between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain respecting the right of search, now so happily terminated,\r\ncould never have arisen if Cuba had not afforded a market for slaves. As\r\nlong as this market shall remain open, there can be no hope for the\r\ncivilization of benighted Africa....\r\n\r\n\"It has been made known to the world by my predecessors that the United\r\nStates have, on several occasions, endeavored to acquire Cuba from Spain\r\nby honorable negotiation. If this were accomplished, the last relic of\r\nthe African slave trade would instantly disappear. We would not, if we\r\ncould, acquire Cuba in any other manner. This is due to our national\r\ncharacter.... This course we shall ever pursue, unless circumstances\r\nshould occur, which we do not now anticipate, rendering a departure from\r\nit clearly justifiable, under the imperative and overruling law of\r\nself-preservation.\" _House Exec.
