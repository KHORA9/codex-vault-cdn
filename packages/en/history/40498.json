If we follow up to its source any\r\npublic institution, fashion, or amusement, which has flourished during a\r\nlong period of time, we can gain some idea of our national progress and\r\ndevelopment; but it strikes us that in no manner can we so well obtain at\r\na rapid glance a view of the salient points of generations that have\r\npassed, as by consulting those small voices that have cried from age to\r\nage from the pages of the press, declaring the wants, the losses, the\r\namusements, and the money-making eagerness of the people.\r\n\r\nAs we read in the old musty files of papers those _naïve_ announcements,\r\nthe very hum of bygone generations seems to rise to the ear. The chapman\r\nexhibits his quaint wares; the mountebank capers again upon his stage; we\r\nhave the living portrait of the highwayman flying from justice; we see the\r\nold china auctions thronged with ladies of quality with their attendant\r\nnegro boys, or those \"by inch of candlelight\" forming many a Schalken-like\r\npicture of light and shade; or, later still, we have Hogarthian sketches\r\nof the young bloods who swelled of old along the Pall-Mall. We trace the\r\nmoving panorama of men and manners up to our own less demonstrative but\r\nmore earnest times; and all these cabinet pictures are the very\r\ndaguerreotypes cast by the age which they exhibit, not done for effect,\r\nbut faithful reflections of those insignificant items of life and things,\r\ntoo small, it would seem, for the generalizing eye of the historian,\r\nhowever necessary to clothe and fill in the dry bones of his history.\r\n\r\nThe _English Mercurie_ of 1588, which professes to have been published\r\nduring those momentous days when the Spanish Armada was hovering and\r\nwaiting to pounce upon our southern shores, contains, among its items of\r\nnews, three or four book advertisements, and these would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen the first put forth in England were that newspaper genuine. Mr.\r\nWatts, of the British Museum, has, however, proved that the several\r\nnumbers of this journal to be found in our national library are gross\r\nforgeries, and, indeed, the most inexperienced eye in such matters can\r\neasily see that neither their type, paper, spelling, nor composition are\r\nmuch more than one, instead of upwards of two centuries and a half old.\r\nNewspapers, in the strict sense of the word--that is, publications of news\r\nappearing at stated intervals, and regularly paged on--did not make their\r\nappearance until the latter end of the reign of James I. The _Weekely\r\nNewes_, published in London in 1622, was the first publication which\r\nanswered to this description; it contained, however, only a few scraps of\r\nforeign intelligence, and was quite destitute of advertisements. The\r\nterrible contest of the succeeding reign was the hotbed which forced the\r\npress of this country into sudden life and extraordinary vigour. Those who\r\nhave wandered in the vaults of the British Museum and contemplated the\r\nvast collection of political pamphlets and the countless Mercuries which\r\nsprang full armed, on either side of the quarrel, from the strong and\r\nearnest brains which wrought in that great political trouble, will not\r\nhesitate to discover, amidst the hubbub of the Rebellion, the first throes\r\nof the press of England as a political power. At such a time, when\r\nMarchmort Needham fell foul with his types of Sir John Birkenhead and the\r\ncourt party which he supported, with as heavy a hand and as dauntless a\r\nwill as Cromwell hurled his Ironsides at the Cavaliers at Naseby, it is\r\nnot likely that we should find the press the vehicle to make known the\r\ngoods of tradesmen, or to offer a reward for stolen horses. The\r\nshopkeepers themselves, as well as the nobility, were too hard at it, to\r\navail themselves of this new mode of extending their trade: they had to\r\nkeep guard over the malignants, to cover the five members with the shield\r\nof their arms, to overawe Whitehall, to march to the relief of\r\nGloucester,--objects quite sufficient to account for the fact that the\r\ntrain-bands were not advertisers. After the king's death, however, when\r\nthe Commonwealth had time to breathe, the people seem to have discovered\r\nthe use of the press as a means of making known their wants and of giving\r\npublicity to their wares. The very first advertisement we have met with,\r\nafter an active search among the earliest newspapers, relates to a book\r\nwhich is entitled--\r\n\r\n    Irenodia Gratulatoria, an Heroick Poem; being a congratulatory\r\n    panegyrick for my Lord General's late return, summing up his successes\r\n    in an exquisite manner.\r\n\r\n    To be sold by John Holden, in the New Exchange, London. Printed by\r\n    Tho. Newcourt, 1652.\r\n\r\nThis appeared in the January number of the Parliamentary paper _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_. It is evidently a piece of flattery to Cromwell upon his\r\nvictories in Ireland, and might have been inserted at the instigation of\r\nthe great Commonwealth leader himself. Booksellers appear to have been the\r\nfirst to take advantage of this new medium of publicity, and for the\r\nobvious reason that their goods were calculated for the readers of the\r\npublic journals, who at that time must have consisted almost exclusively\r\nof the higher orders. From this date to the Restoration the quaintest\r\ntitles of works on the political and religious views, such as were then in\r\nthe ascendant, are to be found in the _Mercurius Politicus_: thus, we have\r\n\"Gospel Marrow;\" \"A few Sighs from Hell, or the Groans of a Damned Soul;\"\r\n\"Michael opposing the Dragon, or a Fiery Dart struck through the Kingdom\r\nof the Serpent.\" And in the number for September, 1659, we find an\r\nadvertisement which seems to bring us face to face with one of the\r\nbrightest names in the roll of English poets:--\r\n\r\n    Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove Hirelings out of\r\n    the Church; wherein is also discours'd of Tithes, Church Fees, Church\r\n    Revenues, and whether any maintenance of Ministers can be settled by\r\n    Law. The author, J. M. Sold by _Livewell Chapman_, at the Crown in\r\n    Pope's Head Alley.\r\n\r\nIn juxtaposition to these illustrious initials we find another\r\nadvertisement, which is the representative of a class that prevailed most\r\nextensively at this early time--the Hue and Cry after runaway servants and\r\nlost or stolen horses and dogs. Every generation is apt to praise, like\r\nOrlando, \"the antique service of the old world;\" but a little excursion\r\ninto the regions of the past shows us how persistent this cry has been in\r\nall ages. Employers who are in the habit of eulogising servants of the\r\n\"old school,\" would be exceedingly astonished to find that two hundred\r\nyears ago they were a very bad lot indeed, as far as we can judge from the\r\nadvertisements of rewards for the seizure of delinquents of their class.\r\nHere is a full-length portrait of apparently a runaway apprentice, as\r\ndrawn in the _Mercurius Politicus_ of July 1st, 1658:--\r\n\r\n    If any one can give notice of one _Edward Perry_, being about the age\r\n    of eighteen or nineteen years, of low stature, black hair, full of\r\n    pockholes in his face; he weareth a new gray suit trimmed with green\r\n    and other ribbons, a light Cinnamon-colored cloak, and black hat, who\r\n    run away lately from his Master; they are desired to bring or send\r\n    word to _Tho. Firby_, Stationer, at Gray's Inne gate, who will\r\n    thankfully reward them.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the dashing appearance of this runaway\r\napprentice, habited in his gray suit trimmed with green ribbons, and\r\nfurbished off so spicily with his cinnamon-coloured cloak, is rather\r\nmarred by the description of his face as \"full of pockholes.\" Unless the\r\nreader has scanned the long list of villanous portraits exhibited by the\r\nHue and Cry in the old papers of the last portion of the seventeenth and\r\nfirst portion of the eighteenth centuries, he can form but a faint\r\nconception of the ravages committed by the small-pox upon the population.\r\nEvery man seemed more or less to have been speckled with \"pockholes,\" and\r\nthe race must have presented one moving mass of pits and scars. Here, for\r\ninstance, is a companion picture to hang with that of Edward Perry,\r\ncopied from the _Mercurius Politicus_ of May 31st, 1660:--\r\n\r\n    A Black-haired Maid, of a middle stature, thick set, with big breasts,\r\n    having her face full marked with the smallpox, calling herself by the\r\n    name of _Nan_ or _Agnes Hobson_, did, upon Monday the 28 of _May_,\r\n    about six o'Clock in the morning, steal away from her Ladies house in\r\n    the Pal-mall a mingle-coloured wrought Tabby Gown of Deer colour and\r\n    white; a black striped Sattin Gown with four broad bone-black silk\r\n    Laces, and a plain black-watered French Tabby Gown; Also, one\r\n    Scarlet-coloured and one other Pink-coloured Sarcenet Peticoat, and a\r\n    white watered Tabby Wastcoat, plain; Several Sarcenet, Mode, and thin\r\n    black Hoods and Scarfs, several fine Holland Shirts, a laced pair of\r\n    Cuffs and Dressing; one pair of Pink-coloured Worsted Stockings, a\r\n    Silver Spoon, a Leather bag, &c. She went away in greyish Cloth\r\n    Wastcoat turned, and a Pink-coloured Paragon upper Peticoat, with a\r\n    green Tammy under one. If any shall give notice of this person, or\r\n    things, at one _Hopkins_, a Shoomaker's, next door to the Vine Tavern,\r\n    near the Pal-mall end, near Charing Cross, or at Mr. _Ostler's_, at\r\n    the Bull Head in Cornhill, near the Old Exchange, they shall be\r\n    rewarded for their pains.\r\n\r\nScarcely a week passes without such runaways being advertised, together\r\nwith a list of the quaint articles of which their booty consisted. At the\r\nrisk of wearying the reader with these descriptions of the \"old-fashioned\"\r\nsort of servants, we give another advertisement from the _Mercurius\r\nPoliticus_ of July 1st 1658:--\r\n\r\n    One _Eleanor Parker_ (by birth _Haddock_), of a Tawny reddish\r\n    complexion, a pretty long nose, tall of stature, servant to Mr.\r\n    _Frederic Howpert_, Kentish Town, upon Saturday last the _26th of\r\n    June_, ran away and stole two Silver Spoons; a sweet Tent-work Bag,\r\n    with gold and silver Lace about it, and lined with Satin; a Bugle\r\n    work-Cushion, very curiously wrought in all manners of slips and\r\n    flowers; a Shell cup, with a Lyon's face, and a Ring of silver in its\r\n    mouth; besides many other things of considerable value, which she took\r\n    out of her Mistresses Cabinet, which she broke open; as also some\r\n    Cloaths and Linen of all sorts, to the value of Ten pounds and\r\n    upwards. If any one do meet with her and please to secure her, and\r\n    give notice to the said _Frederic Howpert_, or else to Mr. _Malpass_,\r\n    Leather-seller, at the Green Dragon, at the upper end of Lawrence\r\n    Lane, he shall be thankfully rewarded for his pains.\r\n\r\nAn advertisement which appears in the same paper, of the date of August\r\n11th, 1659, gives us the first notice we have yet found of the service of\r\nnegro boys in this country. From this period, however, as we shall\r\npresently show, England, at least the fashionable part of it, seems to\r\nhave swarmed with young blackamoors in a greater degree than we should\r\nhave imagined even from the familiar notice made of them in the pages of\r\nthe \"Tatler\" and \"Spectator.\" These early negroes must have been imported\r\nfrom the Portuguese territories, as we did not deal in the article\r\nourselves till the year 1680. The amusing point of the following\r\nadvertisement, however, is the assurance it gives us that the Puritans\r\n\"polled\" their negroes as well as themselves.\r\n\r\n    A Negro-boy, about nine years of age, in a gray Searge suit, his hair\r\n    cut close to his head, was lost on Tuesday last, _August 9_, at night,\r\n    in _S. Nicholas_ Lane, _London_. If any one can give notice of him to\r\n    Mr. _Tho. Barker_, at the Sugarloaf in that Lane, they shall be well\r\n    rewarded for their pains.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we find repeatedly advertised the loss of horses. It is\r\nobservable that during the \"troubles\" such things as highwaymen were\r\nunknown. The bold, unruly characters, who at a later date took to the\r\nroad, were then either enlisted under the banners of the state or had gone\r\nover the sea to Charlie. The great extent to which horse-stealing\r\nprevailed during the Commonwealth period, and, indeed, for the next\r\nhalf-century, might possibly be ascribed to the value of those animals\r\nconsequent upon the scarcity produced by the casualties of the\r\nbattle-field. We cannot account, however, for one fact connected with the\r\nhorse-stealing of the Commonwealth period, namely, that when at grass they\r\nwere often kept _saddled_. The following advertisement, which is an\r\nillustration of this singular custom, is very far from being an uncommon\r\none:--\r\n\r\n    A small black NAG, some ten or eleven years old, no white at all,\r\n    bob-Tailed, wel forehanded, somewhat thin behind, thick Heels, and\r\n    goeth crickling and lamish behind at his first going out; the hair is\r\n    beat off upon his far Hip as broad as a twelvepence; he hath a black\r\n    leather Saddle trimmed with blew, and covered with a black\r\n    Calves-skin, its a little torn upon the Pummel; two new Girths of\r\n    white and green thread, and black Bridle, the Rein whereof is sowed on\r\n    the off side, and a knot to draw it on the near side, Stoln out of a\r\n    field at _Chelmsford_, _21 February_ instant, from Mr. _Henry Bullen_.\r\n    Whosoever can bring tidings to the said Mr. _Bullen_ at _Bromfield_,\r\n    or to Mr. _Newman_ at the Grocer's Arms in _Cornhil_, shall have\r\n    20_s._ for his pains.--_Mercurius Politicus_, February 24, 1659.\r\n\r\nIt could scarcely have been, in this particular case at least, that the\r\nexigencies of the time required such precautions, as the only rising that\r\ntook place this year occurred six months afterwards in the county of\r\nChester. The furniture of the nag, it must be confessed, seems remarkably\r\nadapted for service, and might, from its colour, have belonged to a\r\nveritable Ironside trooper. Another reason, perhaps, of the great value of\r\nhorses at this period, was the establishment of public conveyances, by\r\nwhich means travellers as well as letters were conveyed from one part of\r\nthe kingdom to the other. Prior to the year 1636 there was no such thing\r\nas a postal service for the use of the people in this country. The court\r\nhad, it is true, an establishment for the forwarding of despatches, but\r\nits efficacy may be judged of from a letter written by one Bryan Tuke,\r\n\"master of the postes\" in Henry VIII.'s time, to Cromwell, who had\r\nevidently been sharply reproving him for remissness in forwarding the\r\nking's papers:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Kinges Grace hath no mor ordinary postes, ne of many days hathe\r\n    had, but betweene London and Calais.... For, sir, ye knowe well that,\r\n    except the hackney-horses betweene Gravesende and Dovour, there is no\r\n    suche usual conveyance in post for men in this realme as in the\r\n    accustomed places of France and other partes; ne men can keepe horses\r\n    in redynes withoute som way to bere the charges; but when placardes be\r\n    sent for suche cause (to order the immediate forwarding of some state\r\n    packet) _the constables many tymes be fayne to take horses oute of\r\n    ploues and cartes, wherein can be no extreme diligence_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in the year 1533. Elizabeth, however, established horse-posts on\r\nall the great routes for the transmission of the letters of the court; and\r\nthis, in 1633, was developed into a public post, which went night and day\r\nat the rate of seven miles an hour in summer and five miles in winter--not\r\nsuch bad travelling for those days. Still there was no means of forwarding\r\npassengers until the time of Cromwell, when we find stagecoaches\r\nestablished on all the great roads throughout the kingdom. We do not know\r\nthat we have ever seen quoted so early a notice of public stage\r\nconveyances. We have evidently not given our ancestors so much credit as\r\nthey deserved. The following advertisement shows the time taken and the\r\nfares of a considerable number of these journeys:--\r\n\r\n    From the 26 day of April 1658 there will continue to go Stage Coaches\r\n    from the _George_ Inn, without Aldersgate, _London_, unto the several\r\n    Cities and Towns, for the Rates and at the times, hereafter mentioned\r\n    and declared.\r\n\r\n    _Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday._\r\n\r\n    To _Salisbury_ in two days for xx_s._ To _Blandford_ and _Dorchester_\r\n    in two days and half for xxx_s._ To _Burput_ in three days for xxx_s._\r\n    To _Exmaster_, _Hunnington_, and _Exeter_ in four days for xl_s._\r\n\r\n    To _Stamford_ in two days for xx_s._ To _Newark_ in two days and a\r\n    half for xxv_s._ To _Bawtrey_ in three days for xxx_s._ To _Doncaster_\r\n    and _Ferribridge_ for xxxv_s._ To _York_ in four days for xl_s._\r\n\r\n    _Mondays_ and _Wednesdays_ to _Ockinton_ and _Plymouth_ for l_s._\r\n\r\n    Every _Monday_ to _Helperby_ and _Northallerton_ for xlv_s._ To\r\n    _Darneton_ and _Ferryhil_ for l_s._ To Durham for lv_s._ To\r\n    _Newcastle_ for iii_l._\r\n\r\n    Once every fortnight to _Edinburgh_ for iv_l._ a peece--_Mondays_.\r\n\r\n    Every _Friday_ to _Wakefield_ in four days, xl_s._\r\n\r\n    All persons who desire to travel unto the Cities, Towns, and Roads\r\n    herein hereafter mentioned and expressed, namely--to _Coventry_,\r\n    _Litchfield_, _Stone_, _Namptwich_, _Chester_, _Warrington_, _Wiggan_,\r\n    _Chorley_, _Preston_, _Gastang_, _Lancaster_, and _Kendal_; and also\r\n    to _Stamford_, _Grantham_, _Newark_, _Tuxford_, _Bawtrey_,\r\n    _Doncaster_, _Ferriebridge_, _York_, _Helperly_, _Northallerton_,\r\n    _Darneton_, _Ferryhill_, _Durham_, and _Newcastle_, _Wakefield_,\r\n    _Leeds_, and _Halifax_; and also to _Salisbury_, _Blandford_,\r\n    _Dorchester_, _Burput_, _Exmaster_, _Hunnington_, and _Exeter_,\r\n    _Ockinton_, _Plimouth_, and _Cornwal_; let them repair to the _George_\r\n    Inn at _Holborn Bridge, London_, and thence they shall be in good\r\n    Coaches with good Horses, upon every _Monday_, _Wednesday_, and\r\n    _Fridays_, at and for reasonable Rates.--_Mercurius Politicus_, April\r\n    1, 1658.\r\n\r\nOther announcements about the same time prove that the Great Western road\r\nwas equally provided, as well as the Dover route to the continent. It is\r\nnot a little singular, however, that regularly-appointed coaches, starting\r\nat stated intervals, should have preceded what might be considered the\r\nsimpler arrangement of the horse service. That the development of the\r\npostal system into a means of forwarding single travellers did not take\r\nplace until some time afterwards, would appear from the following:--\r\n\r\n    _The Postmasters on_ Chester _Road, petitioning, have received Order,\r\n    and do accordingly publish the following advertisement_:--\r\n\r\n    All Gentlemen, Merchants, and others, who have occasion to travel\r\n    between _London_ and _Westchester_, _Manchester_, and _Warrington_, or\r\n    any other Town upon that Road, for the accommodation of Trade,\r\n    dispatch of Business, and ease of Purse, upon every Monday, Wednesday,\r\n    and Friday Morning, betwixt Six and ten of the Clock, at the House of\r\n    Mr. _Christopher Charteris_, at the sign of the Hart's-Horn, in\r\n    West-Smithfield, and Post-Master there, and at the Post-Master of\r\n    _Chester_, at the Post-Master of _Manchester_, and at the Post-Master\r\n    of _Warrington_, may have a good and able single Horse, or more,\r\n    furnished at Threepence the Mile, without the charge of a Guide; and\r\n    so likewise at the House of Mr. _Thomas Challenor_, Post-Master at\r\n    _Stone_ in _Staffordshire_, upon every Tuesday, Thursday, and\r\n    Saturdays Morning, to go for _London_. And so likewise at the several\r\n    Post-Masters upon the Road, who will have all such set days so many\r\n    Horses with Furniture in readiness to furnish the Riders without any\r\n    stay to carry them to or from any the places aforesaid, in Four days,\r\n    as well to _London_ as from thence, and to places nearer in less time,\r\n    according as their occasions shall require, they ingaging at the first\r\n    Stage where they take Horse, for the safe delivery of the same to the\r\n    next immediate Stage, and not to ride that Horse any further without\r\n    consent of the Post-Master by whom he rides, and so from Stage to\r\n    Stage to their Journeys end. _All those who intend to ride this way\r\n    are desired to give a little notice beforehand, if conveniently they\r\n    can, to the several Post-masters where they first take horse, whereby\r\n    they may be furnished with so many Horses as the Riders shall require\r\n    with expedition._ This undertaking began the 28 of _June_ 1658 at all\r\n    the Places abovesaid, and so continues by the several Post-Masters.\r\n\r\nThe intimation that these horses might be had without the \"charge of a\r\nguide\" gives us an insight into the bad condition of the roads up to that\r\nperiod. We can scarcely imagine, in these days, the necessity for a guide\r\nto direct us along the great highways of England, and can with difficulty\r\nrealize to ourselves the fact that as late as the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century the interior of the country was little better than a\r\nwilderness, as we may indeed gather from Pepy's journey from London to\r\nBristol and back, in which the item \"guides\" formed no inconsiderable\r\nportion of his expenses.\r\n\r\nIn turning over the musty little quarto newspapers which mirror with such\r\nvividness the characteristic lineaments of the Commonwealth period, not\r\nyet left behind us, we chanced upon an advertisement which tells perhaps\r\nmore than any other of the dangerous complexion of those times. It is an\r\nadvertisement for some runaway young \"sawbones,\" whose love of desperate\r\nadventure appears to have led him to prefer the tossing of a pike to\r\npounding with a pestle:--\r\n\r\n    _George Weale_, a Cornish youth, about 18 or 19 years of age, serving\r\n    as an Apprentice at _Kingston_ with one Mr. _Weale_, an Apothecary,\r\n    and his Uncle, about the time of the rising of the Counties _Kent_ and\r\n    _Surrey_, went secretly from his said Uncle, and is conceived to have\r\n    engaged in the same, and to be either dead, or slain in some of those\r\n    fights, having never since been heard of, either by his said Uncle, or\r\n    any of his Friends. If any person can give notice of the certainty of\r\n    the death of the said _George Weale_, let him repair to the said Mr.\r\n    _Graunt_ his House in Drum-alley in Drury Lane, _London_; he shall\r\n    have twenty shillings for his pains.--_Mercurius Politicus_, Dec. 8,\r\n    1659.\r\n\r\nHere at least we have probably preserved the name of one of the fameless\r\nmen who were \"slain in some of those fights,\" a phrase which in these days\r\nopens to us a chapter in romance.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of book advertisements and quack medicines, we have not\r\nup to this date met with a single instance of a tradesman turning the\r\nnewspaper to account in making known his goods to the public. The very\r\nfirst announcement of this nature, independently of its being in itself a\r\ncuriosity, possesses a very strong interest, from the fact that it marks\r\nthe introduction of an article of food which perhaps more than all others\r\nhas served to wean the nation from one of its besetting sins of\r\nold--drunkenness. Common report, Mr. Disraeli informs us, attributes the\r\nintroduction of \"the cup which cheers but not inebriates,\" to Lord\r\nArlington and Lord Ossory, who are said to have brought over a small\r\nquantity from Holland in 1666. The author of the \"Curiosities of\r\nLiterature\" does not think this statement satisfactory, and tells us that\r\nhe has heard of Oliver Cromwell's teapot being in the possession of a\r\ncollector. We never knew before of these teetotal habits of the Protector,\r\nbut we can so far back the story as to find chronologically correct bohea\r\nto put into his pot; for though it is true that the date of the following\r\nadvertisement is three weeks after the death of his highness, it refers to\r\nthe article as a known and, by physicians, an approved drink, and\r\ntherefore must have been some time previously on sale:--\r\n\r\n    That Excellent and by all Physitians approved _China_ Drink called by\r\n    the _Chineans Tcha_, by other Nations _Tay alias Tee_, is sold at the\r\n    _Sultaness Head Cophee-House_, in _Sweetings_ Rents, by the Royal\r\n    Exchange, _London_.--_Mercurius Politicus_, September 30, 1658.\r\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the earliest authentic announcement yet made known of\r\nthe public sale in England of this now famous beverage. The mention of a\r\n\"Cophee-house\" proves that the sister stimulant was even then making way\r\nin the country.[1] It took, however, a couple of centuries to convert\r\nthem, in the extended sense of the term, into national drinks; but, like\r\nmany other good things, it came too early. Tea may have sufficed for\r\nfanatics, Anabaptists, Quakers, Independents, and self-denying sectaries\r\nof all kinds; and for all we know, its early introduction, had the\r\nCommonwealth lasted, might have accelerated the temperance movement a\r\ncentury at least; but the wheel of fortune was about to turn once\r\nmore--mighty ale had to be broached, and many deep healths to be drunk by\r\nthose who had \"come to their own again;\" and tea, for full half a century,\r\nwas washed away by brown October and the French wines that came in with\r\nthe Merry Monarch.\r\n\r\nWe have now brought the reader upon the very borders of the period when\r\nCharles, with his hungry followers, landed in triumph at Dover. The\r\nadvertisements which appeared during the time that Monk was temporizing\r\nand sounding his way to the Restoration, form a capital barometer of the\r\nstate of feeling among political men at that critical juncture. We see no\r\nmore of the old Fifth-Monarchy spirit abroad. Ministers of the\r\nsteeple-houses evidently note the storm coming, and cease their\r\nlong-winded warnings to a backsliding generation. Every one is either\r\npanting to take advantage of the first sunshine of royal favour, or to\r\ndeprecate its wrath, the coming shadow of which is clearly seen. Meetings\r\nare advertised of those persons who have purchased sequestered estates, in\r\norder that they may address the King to secure them in possession;\r\nparliamentary aldermen repudiate by the same means, charges in the papers\r\nthat their names are to be found in the list of those persons who \"sat\r\nupon the tryal of the late King;\" the works of \"late\" bishops begin again\r\nto air themselves in the Episcopal wind that is clearly setting in; and\r\n\"The Tears, Sighs, Complaints, and Prayers of the Church of England\"\r\nappear in the advertising columns in place of the sonorous titles of\r\nsturdy old Baxter's works. It is clear there is a great commotion at hand;\r\nthe leaves are rustling, and the dust is moving. In the very midst of it,\r\nhowever, we find one name still faithful to the \"old cause,\" as the\r\nPuritans call it: on the 8th of March, 1660--that is, while the sway of\r\nCharles's sceptre had already cast its shadow from Breda--we find the\r\nfollowing advertisement in the _Mercurius Politicus_:--\r\n\r\n    The ready and easie way to establish a free Commonwealth, and the\r\n    excellence thereof compared with the inconveniences and dangers of\r\n    readmitting Kingship in this Nation. The Author, J. M. Wherein, by\r\n    reason of the Printers haste, the Errata not coming in time, it is\r\n    desired that the following faults may be amended. Page 9, line 32, for\r\n    _the Areopagus_ read _of Areopagus_.

Sold by _Livewel Chapman_, at the\r\n    Crown, in Pope's-head Alley.\r\n\r\nThe calmness of the blind bard in thus issuing corrections to his\r\nhastily-printed pamphlet on behalf of a falling cause, excites our\r\nadmiration, and gives us an exalted idea of his moral courage. In two\r\nmonths, as might have been expected, he was a proscribed fugitive,\r\nsheltering his honoured head from the pursuit of Charles's myrmidons in\r\nsome secret hiding-place in Westminster, whilst his works, by order of the\r\nHouse, were being burned by the common hangman.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers were not slow in perceiving the way the wind was blowing, and\r\nset their sails accordingly--if we may take the action of one Mr. Nicholas\r\nBacon, as shown in the following advertisement, as any index of the\r\nfeelings of his fellows:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas one Capt. _Gouge_, a witness examined against the late Kings\r\n    Majesty, in those Records stiled himself of the Honorable Society of\r\n    _Grays_ Inne. These are to give notice that the said _Gouge_, being\r\n    long sought for, was providentially discovered in a disguise, seized\r\n    in that Society, and now in custody, being apprehended by the help of\r\n    some spectators that knew him, viewing of a Banner with his Majesties\r\n    arms, set up just at the same time of His Majesties landing, on an\r\n    high Tower in the same Society, by _Nicholas Bacon_, Esq., a Member\r\n    thereof, as a memorial of so great a deliverance, and testimony of his\r\n    constant loyalty to His Majesty, and that the said _Gouge_ upon\r\n    examination confessed, That he was never admitted not so much as a\r\n    Clerk of that Society.--_Mercurius Politicus_, June 7, 1660.\r\n\r\nWhilst all London was throwing up caps for the restored monarch, and\r\nEngland seemed so glad that he himself wondered how he could have been\r\npersuaded to stop away so long, let us catch the lost luggage of a poor\r\ncavalier, who has just followed his royal master from his long banishment,\r\nand turn out its contents for our reader, in order to show that even\r\nruined old courtiers carried more impedimenta than the famous \"shirt,\r\ntowel, and piece of soap\" of our renowned Napier. The _Mercurius Publicus_\r\nis now our mine, in which we sink a shaft, and come up with this fossil\r\nadvertisement, which bears date July 5th, 1660:--\r\n\r\n    _A Leathern Portmantle Lost at_ Sittingburn _or_ Rochester, _when his\r\n    Majesty came thither, wherein was a Suit of Camolet Holland, with two\r\n    little laces in a seam, eight pair of white Gloves, and a pair of Does\r\n    leather; about twenty yards of skie-colourd Ribbon twelvepenny broad,\r\n    and a whole piece of black Ribbon tenpenny broad, a cloath\r\n    lead-coloured cloak, with store of linnen; a pair of shooes, slippers,\r\n    a Montero, and other things; all which belong to a Gentleman (a near\r\n    servant to His Maiesty) who hath been too long Imprisoned and\r\n    Sequestered to be now robbed when all men hope to enjoy their own. If\r\n    any can give notice, they may leave word with_ Mr. Samuel Merne, _His\r\n    Majesties Book-binder, at his house in Little Britain, and they shall\r\n    be thankfully rewarded._\r\n\r\nThe king had not been \"in\" a month ere his habits appear through the\r\npublic papers. The _Mercurius Politicus_ is now turned courtier, and has\r\nchanged its name to the _Mercurius Publicus_. Its columns, indeed, are\r\nentirely under the direction of the king, and, instead of slashing\r\narticles against malignants, degenerates into a virulent oppressor of the\r\nPuritans, and a vehicle for inquiries after his majesty's favourite dogs\r\nthat have been stolen. In the number for June 28th, 1660, for instance, we\r\nfind the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n    [Hand] A smooth black DOG, less than a Grey-hound, with white under\r\n    his breast, belonging to the Kings Majesty, was taken from Whitehall,\r\n    the eighteenth day of this instant _June_, or thereabouts. If any one\r\n    can give notice to _John Ellis_, one of his Majesties servants, or to\r\n    his Majesties Back-Stairs, shall be well rewarded for their labour.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that \"the smooth black dog\" was a very great favourite, for\r\nthe next publication of the journal contains another advertisement with\r\nrespect to him, printed in larger Italic type, the diction of which, from\r\nits pleasant raillery, looks as though it had come from the king's own\r\nhand:--\r\n\r\n    [Hand] _We must call upon you again for a Black Dog, between a\r\n    Grey-hound and a Spaniel, no white about him, onely a streak on his\r\n    Brest, and Tayl a little bobbed. It is His Majesties own Dog, and\r\n    doubtless was stoln, for the Dog was not born nor bred in_ England,\r\n    _and would never forsake his Master. Whosoever findes him may acquaint\r\n    any at Whitehal, for the Dog was better known at Court than those who\r\n    stole him. Will they never leave robbing His Majesty? must he not keep\r\n    a Dog? This Dogs place (though better than some imagine) is the\r\n    only place which nobody offers to beg._\r\n\r\nPepys, about this time, describes the king with a train of spaniels and\r\nother dogs at his heels, lounging along and feeding the ducks in St.\r\nJames's Park; and on occasions still later he was often seen talking to\r\nNelly, as she leaned from her garden-wall that abutted upon the Pall-Mall,\r\nwhilst his canine favourites grouped around him. On these occasions\r\nperhaps the representatives of those gentlemen to be seen in\r\nRegent-street, with two bundles of animated wool beneath their arms, were\r\non the look-out, as we find his majesty continually advertising his lost\r\ndogs. Later we find him inquiring after \"a little brindled greyhound\r\nbitch, having her two hinder feet white;\" for a \"white-haired spaniel,\r\nsmooth-coated, with large red or yellowish spots,\" and for a \"black\r\nmastiff dog, with cropped ears and cut tail.\" And when royalty had done,\r\nhis Highness Prince Rupert, or Buckingham, or \"my Lord Albemarle,\"\r\nresorted to the _London Gazette_ to make known their canine losses. We\r\nthink the change in the temper of the age is more clearly marked by these\r\ndog advertisements than by anything else. The Puritans did not like\r\nsporting animals of any kind, and we much question whether a dog would\r\nhave followed a fifth-monarchy-man. Hence the total absence of all\r\nadvertisements bearing upon the \"fancy.\" Now that the king had returned,\r\nthe old English love of field-sports spread with fourfold vigour. We\r\nchance upon the traces too of a courtly amusement which had been handed\r\ndown from the middle ages, and was then only lingering amongst\r\nus--hawking. Here is an inquiry after a lost lanner:--\r\n\r\n    Richard Finney, Esquire, of Alaxton, in Leicestershire, about a\r\n    fortnight since lost a LANNER from that place; she hath neither Bells\r\n    nor Varvels; she is a white Hawk, and her long feathers and sarcels\r\n    are both in the blood. If any one give tidings thereof to Mr. Lambert\r\n    at the golden Key in Fleet-street, they shall have forty shillings for\r\n    their pains.--_Mercurius Publicus_, September 6, 1660.\r\n\r\nAs London was the only place in which a newspaper was published during the\r\nreign of Charles, and indeed for nearly fifty years afterwards, the hue\r\nand cry after lost animals always came to town, as a matter of course. It\r\nsounds strange to read these advertisements of a sport the very terms of\r\nwhich are now unintelligible to us. What ages seem to have passed since\r\nthese birds, in all the glory of scarlet hoods, were carried upon some\r\n\"faire lady's\" wrist, or poised themselves, with fluttering wing, as the\r\nfalconer uncovered them to view their quarry! We have skipped a few years,\r\nin order to afford one or two more examples of these picturesque\r\nadvertisements, so different from anything to be seen at the present\r\nday:--\r\n\r\n    Lost on the 30 of October, 1665, an Intermix'd Barbary Tercel Gentle,\r\n    engraven in Varvels, Richard Windwood, of Ditton Park, in the County\r\n    of Bucks, Esq. For more particular marks--if the Varvels be taken\r\n    off--the 4th feather in one of the wings Imped, and the third pounce\r\n    of the right foot broke. If any one inform Sir William Roberts, Knight\r\n    and Baronet (near Harrow-on-the-Hill, in the County of Middlesex), or\r\n    Mr. William Philips, at the King's Head in Paternoster Row, of the\r\n    Hawk, he shall be sufficiently rewarded.--_The Intelligencer_, Nov. 6,\r\n    1665.\r\n\r\nThe next paper contains an inquiry for a goshawk belonging to Lord William\r\nPetre, and two years later a royal bird is inquired after in the _London\r\nGazette_, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    A Sore ger Falcon of His Majesty, lost the 13 of August, who had one\r\n    Varvel of his Keeper, Roger Higs, of Westminster, Gent. Whosoever hath\r\n    taken her up and give notice Sir Allan Apsley, Master of His Majesties\r\n    Hawks at St. James's, shall be rewarded for his paines. Back-Stairs in\r\n    Whitehall.\r\n\r\nThis Sir Allan Apsley is the brother of Mrs. Hutchinson, who has given us\r\nsuch a vivid picture, in the memoir of her husband, of the Commonwealth\r\ntime. The _London Gazette_, from which we quote, is the only paper still\r\nin existence that had its root in those days. It first appeared in Oxford,\r\nupon the Court taking up its abode in that city during the time of the\r\nGreat Plague, and was therefore called the _Oxford Gazette_. On the return\r\nof Charles to London it followed in his train, and became the _London\r\nGazette_, or Court and official paper, and the latter character it has\r\nretained to the present hour. The gazettes of the seventeenth century were\r\nwidely different from those of our day. They contain foreign news, as well\r\nas state papers, royal proclamations, &c., and, stranger still,\r\nmiscellaneous advertisements are mixed up with those upon the business of\r\nthe Court. The quack doctors, with an eye, we suppose, to the \"quality,\"\r\nwere the first to avail themselves of its pages to make known their\r\nnostrums. It will astonish our readers to find what an ancestry some of\r\nthe quack medicines of the present day have had. \"Nervous powders,\"\r\nspecifics for gout, rheumatism, &c., seized upon the columns of the\r\nnewspapers almost as early as they were published. Here is a specimen\r\nwhich might still serve as a model for such announcements:--\r\n\r\n    _Gentlemen_, you are desired to take notice, That Mr. _Theophilus\r\n    Buckworth_ doth at his house on _Mile-end Green_ make and expose to\r\n    sale, for the publick good, those so famous _Lozenges_ or _Pectorals_\r\n    approved for the cure of Consumptions, Coughs, Catarrhs, Asthmas,\r\n    Hoarness, Strongness of Breath, Colds in general, Diseases incident to\r\n    the Lungs, and a sovoraign Antidote against the Plague, and all other\r\n    contagious Diseases and obstructions of the Stomach: And for more\r\n    convenience of the people, constantly leaveth them sealed up with his\r\n    coat of arms on the papers, with Mr. _Rich. Lowndes_ (as formerly), at\r\n    the sign of the White Lion, near the little north door of _Pauls\r\n    Church_; Mr. _Henry Seile_, over against _S. Dunstan's_ Church in\r\n    Fleet Street; Mr. _William Milward_, at _Westminster_ Hall Gate; Mr.\r\n    _John Place_, at _Furnival's Inn Gate_, in Holborn; and Mr. _Robert\r\n    Horn_, at the Turk's-head near the entrance of the Royal Exchange,\r\n    Booksellers, and no others.\r\n\r\n        _This is published to prevent the designs of divers Pretenders,\r\n        who counterfeit the said Lozenges, to the disparagement of the\r\n        said Gentleman, and great abuse of the people._--_Mercurius\r\n        Politicus_, Nov. 16, 1660.\r\n\r\nThe next is equally characteristic:--\r\n\r\n    Most Excellent and Approved _Dentifrices_ to scour and cleanse the\r\n    Teeth, making them white as Ivory, preserves from the Toothach; so\r\n    that, being constantly used, the parties using it are never troubled\r\n    with the Toothach: It fastens the Teeth, sweetens the Breath, and\r\n    preserves the Gums and Mouth from Cankers and Imposthumes. Made by\r\n    _Robert Turner_, Gentleman; and the right are onely to be had at\r\n    _Thomas Rookes_, Stationer, at the Holy Lamb at the east end of St.\r\n    Paul's Church, near the School, in sealed papers, at 12_d._ the paper.\r\n\r\n    _The reader is desired to beware of counterfeits._\r\n\r\n    (_Mercurius Politicus_, Dec. 20, 1660.)\r\n\r\nOther advertisements about this time profess to cure all diseases by means\r\nof an \"antimonial cup.\" Sir Kenelm Digby, the same learned knight who\r\nfeasted his wife upon capons fattened upon serpents, in order to make her\r\nfair, advertises a book in which he professes to show a method of curing\r\nwounds by a powder of sympathy; and here is a notification of a remedy\r\nwhich shows still more clearly the superstitious character of the age:--\r\n\r\n    Small baggs to hang about Children's necks, which are excellent both\r\n    for the _prevention and cure_ of the _Rickets_, and to ease children\r\n    in breeding of Teeth, are prepared by Mr. Edmund Buckworth, and\r\n    constantly to be had at Mr. Philip Clark's, Keeper of the Library in\r\n    the Fleet, and nowhere else, at 5 shillings a bagge.--_The\r\n    Intelligencer_, Oct. 16, 1664.\r\n\r\nIt was left, however, to the reign of Anne for the mountebank to descend\r\nfrom his stage in the fair and the market-place, in order to erect it in\r\nthe public newspapers. But we have yet to mention one, who might appear to\r\nsome to be the greatest quack of all, and who about this time resorted to\r\nan advertisement in the newspapers to call his patients to his doors;--the\r\nroyal charlatan, who touched for the evil, makes known that he is at home\r\nfor the season to his people through the medium of the _Public\r\nIntelligencer_ of 1664:--\r\n\r\n    Whitehall, May 14, 1664. His Sacred Majesty, having declared it to be\r\n    his Royal will and purpose to continue the healing of his people for\r\n    the Evil during the Month of May, and then to give over till\r\n    Michaelmas next, I am commanded to give notice thereof, that the\r\n    people may not come up to Town in the Interim and lose their labour.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there was much political significance in this pretended efficacy\r\nof the royal touch in scrofulous afflictions; at the same time, there is\r\nreason to believe that patients did sometimes speedily recover after\r\nundergoing the regal contact. Dr. Tyler Smith, who has written a very\r\nclever little book on the subject, boldly states his belief that the\r\nemotion felt by these poor stricken people who came within the influence\r\nof \"that divinity which doth hedge a king,\" acted upon them as a powerful\r\nmental tonic; in a vast number of cases, however, we might impute the\r\ntonic to the gold coin which the king always bestowed upon his patient. Be\r\nthat as it may, the practice flourished down to the time of Anne, at whose\r\ndeath it stopped; the sovereigns of the line of Brunswick never pretending\r\nto possess this medicinal virtue, coming as they did to the throne by only\r\na parliamentary title. The reaction from the straightlaced times of the\r\nCommonwealth, which set in immediately upon the Restoration, seems to have\r\narrived at its height about the year 1664, and the advertisements at that\r\nperiod reflect very truly the love of pleasure and excitement which seized\r\nhold of the people, as if they were bent on making up for the time that\r\nhad been lost during the Puritanic rule. They are mostly taken up, in\r\nfact, with inquiries after \"lost lace-work;\" announcements of lotteries in\r\nthe Banqueting Hall at Whitehall, of jewels, tapestry, and lockets of \"Mr.\r\nCooper's work,\" of which the following is a fair specimen:--\r\n\r\n    Lost, on the 27th of July, about Boswell Yard or Drury Lane, a Ladyes\r\n    Picture, set in gold, and three Keys, with divers other little things\r\n    in a perfumed pocket. Whosoever shall give notice of or bring the said\r\n    picture to Mr. Charles Coakine, Goldsmith, near Staples Inne, Holborn,\r\n    shall have 4 times the value of the gold for his payns.--_The News_,\r\n    August 4, 1664.\r\n\r\nThe love of the people also for the strange and marvellous is shown by\r\nannouncements of rare sights; for instance, we are told that,--\r\n\r\n    At the Mitre, near the west end of St. Paul's, is to be seen a rare\r\n    Collection of Curiosityes, much resorted to and admired by persons of\r\n    great learning and quality, among which a choyce Egyptian Mummy, with\r\n    hieroglyphicks; the Ant-Beare of Brasil; a Remora; a Torpedo; the Huge\r\n    Thigh-bone of a Giant; a Moon Fish; a Tropic Bird, &c.--_The News_ of\r\n    June 2, 1664.\r\n\r\nA rather scanty collection of articles, it is true, but eked out\r\nmonstrously by the \"huge thigh-bone of a giant,\" which in all probability\r\nbelonged to some huge quadruped. The ignorance of those times with\r\nrespect to natural history must have been something astonishing, as about\r\nthe same date we find the following print of what were evidently\r\nconsidered very curious animals advertised in the _London Gazette_:--\r\n\r\n    A True Representation of the Rhonoserous and Elephant, lately brought\r\n    from the East Indies to London, drawn after the life, and curiously\r\n    engraven in Mezzotinto, printed upon a large sheet of paper. Sold by\r\n    PIERCE TEMPEST, at the Eagle and Child in the Strand, over against\r\n    Somerset House, Water Gate.--The _London Gazette_, Jan. 22, 1664.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding year all advertisements of this kind stop; amusements,\r\nfrom some great disturbing cause, have ceased to attract; there is no more\r\ngambling under the name of lotteries at Whitehall; no more curiosities are\r\nexhibited to a pleasure loving crew; no more books of amorous songs are\r\npublished; no more lockets or perfumed bags are dropped; all is stagnation\r\nand silence, if we may judge as much from the sudden cessation of\r\nadvertisements with reference to them in the public papers. Death now\r\ncomes upon the stage, and rudely shuts the box of Autolycus, crops the\r\nstreet with grass, and marks a red cross on every other door. It is the\r\nyear of the Great Plague. Those who could, fled early from the\r\npest-stricken city; those who remained until the malady had gained\r\nirresistible sway were not allowed to depart, for fear of carrying the\r\ncontagion into the provinces, the Lord Mayor denying to such a clean bill\r\nof health, in consequence of which they were driven back by the rustics as\r\nsoon as discovered. A singular instance also of the vigilance of the\r\nauthorities in confining, as they imagined, the mischief within the limits\r\nof the metropolis is afforded by the succeeding advertisement:--\r\n\r\n    _Nicholas Hurst_, an Upholsterer, over against the Rose Tavern, in\r\n    Russell-street, Covent-Garden, whose Maid Servant dyed lately of the\r\n    Sickness, fled on Monday last out of his house, taking with him\r\n    several Goods and Household Stuff, and was afterwards followed by one\r\n    Doctor Cary and Richard Bayle, with his wife and family, who lodged in\r\n    the same house; but Bayle having his usual dwelling-house in\r\n    Waybridge, in Surrey. Whereof we are commanded to give this Public\r\n    Notice, that diligent search may be made for them, and the houses in\r\n    which any of their persons or goods shall be found may be shut up by\r\n    the next Justice of the Peace, or other his Majesty's Officers of\r\n    Justice, and notice immediately given to some of his Majesty's Privy\r\n    Councill, or to one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of\r\n    State.--_London Gazette_, May 10, 1666.\r\n\r\nAntidotes and remedies for the plague are also commonly advertised, just\r\nas the visitation of the cholera in 1854 filled the columns of the _Times_\r\nfull of all sorts of specifics. Thus, for example, the _Intelligencer_ of\r\nAugust the 28th, 1665, announces \"an excellent electuary against the\r\nplague, to be drunk at the Green Dragon, Cheap-side, at sixpence a pint.\"\r\nThe great and only cure, however, for this fearful visitation, which\r\ncarried off a hundred thousand persons in London alone, was at hand--the\r\npurgation of fire. The conflagration, which burst out on the 2nd of\r\nSeptember, and destroyed thirteen thousand houses, gave the final blow to\r\nits declining attacks. Singularly enough, but faint traces of this\r\noverwhelming calamity, as it was considered at the time, can be gathered\r\nfrom the current advertisements. Although the entire population of the\r\ncity was rendered houseless, and had to encamp in the surrounding fields,\r\nwhere they extemporized shops and streets, not one hint of such a\r\ncircumstance can be found in the public announcements of the period. No\r\ncircumstance could afford a greater proof of the little use made by the\r\ntrading community of this means of publicity in the time of Charles II. If\r\na fire only a hundredth-part so destructive were to occur in these days,\r\nthe columns of the press would immediately be full of the new addresses of\r\nthe burnt-out shopkeepers; and those who were not even damaged by it would\r\ntake care to \"improve the occasion\" to their own advantage. We look in\r\nvain through the pages of the _London Gazette_ of this and the following\r\nyear for one such announcement: not even a tavern-keeper tells us the\r\nnumber of his booth in Goodman's Fields, although quack medicine\r\nflourished away in its columns as usual. In 1667 we see a notification,\r\nnow and then, of some change in the site of a government office, or of the\r\nintention to build by contract some public structure, such as the\r\nfollowing notice relative to the erection of the old Royal Exchange:--\r\n\r\n    All Artificers of the several Trades that must be used in Rebuilding\r\n    the Royal Exchange may take notice, that the Committee appointed for\r\n    Management of that Work do sit at the end of the long gallery in\r\n    Gresham Colledge every Monday in the forenoon, there and then to treat\r\n    with such as are fit to undertake the same.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the reign of Charles is unmarked by the appearance of any\r\ncharacteristic advertisements which give a clue to the peculiar complexion\r\nof the time. If we go back two or three years, however, we shall find one\r\nwhich bears upon the introduction of those monstrous flowing wigs which\r\ncontinued in fashion to the middle of the succeeding century:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas _George Grey_, a Barber and Perrywigge-maker, over against the\r\n    _Greyhound Tavern_, in _Black Fryers, London_, stands obliged to serve\r\n    some particular persons of eminent Condition and Quality in his way of\r\n    Employment: It is therefore notifyed at his desire, that any one\r\n    having long flaxen hayr to sell may repayr to him the said _George\r\n    Grey_, and they shall have 10_s._ the ounce, and for any other long\r\n    fine hayr after the Rate of 5_s._ or 7_s._ the ounce.--_The Newes_,\r\n    February 4, 1663.\r\n\r\nPepys describes, with amusing minuteness, how Chapman the periwig-maker\r\ncut off his hair to make up one of these portentous head-dresses for him,\r\nmuch to the trouble of his servants, Jane and Bessy; and on the Lord's\r\nday, November 8th, 1663, he relates, with infinite _naïveté_, his entrance\r\ninto church with what must evidently have been the perruquier's latest\r\nfashion. \"To church, where I found that my coming in a periwig did not\r\nprove so strange as I was afraid it would; for I thought that all the\r\nchurch would presently have cast their eyes upon me, but I find no such\r\nthing.\" Ten shillings the ounce for long flaxen hair shows the demand for\r\nthis peculiar colour by \"persons of eminent condition and quality.\" We\r\nhave shown, from the advertisements of the time of Charles II., what was\r\nindeed well known, that the age was characterized by frivolous amusements,\r\nand by a love of dress and vicious excitement, in the midst of which\r\npestilence stalked like a mocking fiend, and the great conflagration lit\r\nup the general masquerade with its lurid and angry glare. Together with\r\nthe emasculate tone of manners, a disposition to personal violence and a\r\ncontempt of law stained the latter part of this and the succeeding reign.\r\nThe audacious seizure of the crown jewels by Blood; the attack upon the\r\nDuke of Ormond by the same desperado, that nobleman actually having been\r\ndragged from his coach in St. James's Street in the evening, and carried,\r\nbound, upon the saddle-bow of Blood's horse, as far as Hyde Park Corner,\r\nbefore he could be rescued; the slitting of Sir John Coventry's nose in\r\nthe Haymarket by the king's guard; and the murder of Sir Edmondbury\r\nGodfrey on Primrose Hill, are familiar instances of the prevalence of this\r\nlawless spirit.\r\n\r\nWe catch a glimpse of one of these street outrages in the following\r\nannouncement of an assault upon glorious John:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas _John Dryden, Esq._, was on Monday, the 18th instant, at\r\n    night, barbarously assaulted and wounded, in Rose Street in Covent\r\n    Garden, by divers men unknown; if any person shall make discovery of\r\n    the said offenders to the said Mr. Dryden, or to any Justice of the\r\n    Peace, he shall not only receive Fifty Pounds, which is deposited in\r\n    the hands of Mr. Blanchard, Goldsmith, next door to Temple Bar, for\r\n    the said purpose, but if he be a principal or an accessory in the said\r\n    fact, his Majesty is graciously pleased to promise him his pardon for\r\n    the same.--_The London Gazette_, Dec. 22, 1679.\r\n\r\nAnd here is another of a still more tragic character:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas a Gentleman was, on the eighteenth at night, mortally wounded\r\n    near Lincoln's Inn, in Chancery Lane, in view, as is supposed, of the\r\n    coachman that set him down: these are to give notice that the said\r\n    coachman shall come in and declare his knowledge of the matter; if any\r\n    other person shall discover the said coachman to John Hawles, at his\r\n    chamber in Lincoln's Inn, he shall have 5 guineas reward.--_London\r\n    Gazette_, March 29th, 1688.\r\n\r\nTo this period also may be ascribed the rise of that romantic felon, the\r\nhighwayman. The hue and cry after these genteel robbers is frequently\r\nraised during the reign of James II. In one case we have notice of a\r\ngentleman having been stopped, robbed, and then bound, by mounted men at\r\nIslington, who rode away with his horse; another time these daring gentry\r\nappeared at Knightsbridge; and a third advertisement, of a later date it\r\nis true, offers a reward for three mounted Macheaths, who were charged\r\nwith stopping and robbing three young ladies in South Street, near Audley\r\nChapel, as they were returning home from visiting. The following is still\r\nmore singular, as showing the high social position of some of these\r\ngentlemen who took to the \"road\" for special purposes:--\r\n\r\n    _Whereas Mr. Herbert Jones_, Attorney-at-law in the town of Monmouth,\r\n    well known by being several years together Under-Sheriff of the same\r\n    County, hath of late divers time robbed the Mail coming from that town\r\n    to London, and taken out divers letters and writs, and is now fled\r\n    from justice, and supposed to have sheltered himself in some of the\r\n    new-raised troops. These are to give notice, that whosoever shall\r\n    secure the said Herbert Jones, so as to be committed in order to\r\n    answer these said crimes, may give notice thereof to Sir Thomas\r\n    Fowles, goldsmith, Temple-bar, London, or to Mr. Michael Bohune,\r\n    mercer, in Monmouth, and shall have a guinea's reward.\r\n\r\nThe drinking tendencies of these Jacobite times are chiefly shown by the\r\nnumberless inquiries after lost or stolen silver tankards, and by the\r\nsales of claret and canary which constantly took place. The hammer was not\r\napparently used at that time, as we commonly find announcements of sales\r\nby \"inch of candle,\" a term which mightily puzzled us until we saw the\r\nexplanation of it in our constant book of reference, the Diary of Pepys:--\r\n\r\n    \"After dinner we met and sold the Weymouth, Successe, and Fellowship\r\n    hulkes; where pleasant to see how backward men are at first to bid;\r\n    and yet, when the candle is going out, how they bawl, and dispute\r\n    afterwards who bid the most. And here I observed one man cunninger\r\n    than the rest, that was sure to bid the last man and to carry it; and\r\n    inquiring the reason he told me that, just as the flame goes out, the\r\n    smoke descends, which is a thing I never observed before, and by that\r\n    he do know the instant when to bid last.\" (Sept. 3rd, 1662).\r\n\r\nThe taste for auctions, which became such a rage in the time of Anne, had\r\nits beginning about this period. Books and pictures are constantly\r\nadvertised to be disposed of in this manner. The love of excitement born\r\nin the gaming time of the Restoration might be traced in these sales, and\r\nin the lotteries, or \"adventures\" as they were sometimes termed, which\r\nextended to every conceivable article capable of being sold. The rising\r\ntaste of the town was, however, checked for the time by the Revolution,\r\nwhich was doubtless hastened on by such announcements as the following,\r\nwhich appeared in the _Gazette_ of March 1, 1688:--\r\n\r\n    Catholic loyalty, [Hand] upon the subject of Government and Obedience,\r\n    delivered in a SERMON before the King and Queen, in His Majesties\r\n    Chapel at Whitehall, on the 13 of June, 1687, by the Revnd. Father\r\n    Edward Scaraisbroke, priest of the Society of Jesus. Published by His\r\n    Majesty's Command. Sold by Raydal Taylor, near Stationers Hall,\r\n    London.\r\n\r\nUp to this time advertisements only appeared in threes and fours, and\r\nrarely, if ever, exceeded a dozen, in any newspaper of the day. They were\r\ngenerally stuck in the middle of the diminutive journal, but sometimes\r\nformed a tail-piece to it. They were confined in their character, and gave\r\nno evidence of belonging to a great commercial community. Now and then, it\r\nis true, sums of money were advertised as seeking investment; more\r\nconstantly a truss for a \"broken belly,\" or an \"excellent dentifrice,\"\r\nappeared; or some city mansion of the nobility is advertised to let,\r\nshowing the progress westward even then, as witness the following:--\r\n\r\n    The Earl of Berkeley's House, with Garden and Stables in St. John's\r\n    Lane, not far from Smith Field, is to be Let or Sold for Building.\r\n    Enquire of Mr. Prestworth, a corn chandler, near the said house, and\r\n    you may know further.--_London Gazette_, August 17, 1685.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance of the singular manner in which fire-insurances were\r\nconducted in that day:--\r\n\r\n    There having happened a fire on the 24th of the last month by which\r\n    several houses of the friendly society were burned to the value of 965\r\n    pounds, these are to give notice to all persons of the said society\r\n    that they are desired to pay at the office Faulcon Court in Fleet\r\n    Street their several proportions of their said loss, which comes to\r\n    five shillings and one penny for every hundred pounds insured, before\r\n    the 12th of August next.--_London Gazette_, July 6th, 1685.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is a \"flee-bitten grey mare\" stolen out of \"Mary-le-bone\r\nPark,\" or a lost lottery-ticket, or a dog, that is inquired after; but\r\nthey contained no hint that England possessed a commercial marine, or that\r\nshe was destined to become a nation of shopkeepers. As yet, too, there was\r\nno sign given of that wonderful art of ingenious puffing which now exists,\r\nand which might lead a casual observer to imagine that the nation\r\nconsisted of only two classes--cheats and dupes.\r\n\r\nFrom the settlement of 1688 the true value of the advertisement appears to\r\nhave dawned upon the public. The country evidently began to breathe\r\nfreely, and with Dutch William and Protestant ascendancy, the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the nation burst forth with extraordinary vigour. Enterprise\r\nof all kinds was called forth, and cast its image upon the advertising\r\ncolumns of the public journals, now greatly increased both in size and in\r\nnumbers, no less than twenty-six having been set up within four years\r\nafter the Revolution. It is observable, too, that from this political\r\nconvulsion dates a certain rough humour, which, however latent, was not\r\nbefore expressed in the public papers, especially on matters political.\r\nLet us further elucidate our meaning by quoting the following from the\r\n_New Observator_ of July 17, 1689, setting forth a popular and practical\r\nmethod of parading the Whig triumph:--\r\n\r\n    Orange cards, representing the late King's reign and expedition of the\r\n    Prince of Orange: viz. The Earl of Essex Murther, Dr. Otes Whipping,\r\n    Defacing the Monument, My Lord Jeffries in the West hanging of\r\n    Protestants, Magdalen College, Trial of the Bishops, Castle Maine at\r\n    Rome, the Popish Midwife, A Jesuit Preaching against our Bible,\r\n    Consecrated Smock, My Lord Chancellor at the Bed's feet, Birth of the\r\n    Prince of Wales, The Ordinaire Mass-house pulling down and burning by\r\n    Captain Tom and his Mobile, Mortar pieces in the Tower, The Prince of\r\n    Orange Landing, The Jesuits Scampering, Father Peter's Transactions,\r\n    The Fight at Reading, The Army going over to the Prince of Orange,\r\n    Tyrconnel in Ireland, My Lord Chancellor in the Tower. With many other\r\n    remarkable passages of the Times. To which is added the efigies of our\r\n    Gracious K. William and Q. Mary, curiously illustrated and engraven in\r\n    lively figures, done by the performers of the first Popish Plot Cards.\r\n    Sold by Donnan Newman, the publisher and printer of the New\r\n    Observator.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _New Observator_ was Bishop Burnet, and these political\r\nplaying-cards were sold by his publisher; perhaps the great Protestant\r\nbishop knew something of their \"performers.\" In the year 1692 an\r\nexperiment was made which clearly shows how just an estimate was getting\r\nabroad of the value of publicity in matters of business. A newspaper was\r\nset up, called \"The City Mercury, published gratis for the Promotion of\r\nTrade,\" which lasted for two years, and contained nothing but\r\nadvertisements. The proprietor undertook to distribute a thousand copies\r\nper week to the then chief places of resort,--coffee houses, taverns, and\r\nbookshops. Even in these days of the \"Times\" double supplement such an\r\nexperiment has often been made and failed; our wonder, therefore, is not\r\nthat the _City Mercury_ went to that limbo which is stored with such\r\ncountless abortive journals, but that the interest felt in advertisements\r\nshould, at that early period, have kept it alive so long.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing scheme proves that an attempt was then made to subdivide\r\nthe duties of a newspaper--that of keeping its readers informed of the\r\nnews of the day, and of forming a means of publicity for the wants and\r\nlosses of individuals--the advertisement we are about to quote clearly\r\nshows that at the same time there was a plan in existence for combining\r\nthe printed newspaper with the more ancient written newsletter. It is well\r\nknown that long after the institution of public journals the old\r\nprofession of the newsletter-writer continued to flourish. We can easily\r\naccount for this fact when we remember that during the heat of a great\r\nrebellion it was much more safe to write than to print the intelligence of\r\nthe day. Many of these newsletters were written by strong partisans, and\r\ncontained information which it was neither desirable nor safe that their\r\nopponents should see. They were passed on from hand to hand in secret, and\r\noften endorsed by each successive reader. We are told that the Cavaliers,\r\nwhen taken prisoners, have been known to eat their newsletters; and some\r\nof Prince Rupert's, which had been intercepted, are still in existence,\r\nand bear dark-red stains, which testify to the desperate manner in which\r\nthey were defended. It is pretty certain, however, that, as a profession,\r\nnewsletter-writing began to decline after the Revolution; although we find\r\nthe editor of the _Evening Post_, as late as the year 1709, reminding its\r\nreaders that \"there must be three or four pounds a year paid for written\r\nnews.\" At the same time the public journals, it is clear, had not\r\nperformed that part of their office which was really more acceptable to\r\nthe country reader than any other--the retailing the political and social\r\nchit-chat of the day. We have only to look into the public papers to\r\nconvince ourselves how wofully they fell short in a department which must\r\nhave been the staple of the news-writer. This want still being felt, John\r\nSalusbury devises a scheme to combine the old and the new plan after the\r\nfollowing manner, as announced in the _Flying Post_ of 1694:--\r\n\r\n    If any Gentleman has a mind to oblige his country friend or\r\n    correspondent with the Account of Public Affairs, he may have it for\r\n    twopence of J. Salusbury at the Rising-Sun in Cornhill, on a sheet of\r\n    fine paper, half of which being blank, he may thereon write his own\r\n    private business or the material news of the day.\r\n\r\nIt does not say much for the energy with which the journals of that day\r\nwere conducted, that the purchasers are invited to write therein \"the\r\nmaterial news of the day;\" that, we should have thought, was the editor's\r\nbusiness to have supplied; but it was perhaps a contrivance by which the\r\nJacobites might circulate information, by means of the post, without\r\ncompromising the printer. We have seen many such papers, half print, half\r\nmanuscript, in the British Museum, which had passed through the post, the\r\nmanuscript portion of which, the Home Secretaries of our time would have\r\nthought sufficiently treasonable to justify them in having broken their\r\nseals.\r\n\r\nAs advertisements, from their earliest introduction, were used to make\r\nknown the amusements of the day and the means of killing time at the\r\ndisposal of persons of quality, it seems strange that it was not employed\r\nsooner than it was to draw a company to the theatres. We have looked in\r\nvain for the announcement of any theatrical entertainment before the year\r\n1701, when the advertisement of the Lincoln's Inn Theatre makes its\r\nappearance in the columns of the _English Post_. The lead of this little\r\nhouse was, however, speedily followed by the larger ones, and only a few\r\nyears later we have regular lists of the performances at all the theatres\r\nin the daily papers. The first journal of this description was the _Daily\r\nCourant_, published in 1709. In this year also appeared the celebrated\r\n\"Tatler,\" to be speedily followed by the \"Spectator\" and \"Guardian,\" the\r\nsocial and literary journals of that Augustine age. The first edition of\r\nthe \"Tatler,\" in the British Museum, contains advertisements like an\r\nordinary paper, and they evidently reflect, more than those of its\r\ncontemporaries, the flying fashions of the day and the follies of the\r\n\"quality.\" In them we notice the rage that existed for lotteries, or\r\n\"sales,\" as they were called. Every conceivable thing was put up to\r\nraffle. We see advertisements headed \"A Sixpenny Sale of Lace,\" \"A Hundred\r\nPounds for Half-a-crown,\" \"A Penny Adventure for a Great Pie,\" \"A\r\nQuarter's Rent,\" \"A Freehold Estate,\" \"Threepenny Sales of Houses,\" \"A\r\nfashionable Coach.\" Gloves, looking-glasses, chocolate, Hungary water,\r\nIndian goods, lacquered ware, fans, &c., were notified to be disposed of\r\nin this manner, and the fair mob was called together to draw their tickets\r\nby the same means. This fever, which produced ten years later the\r\ncelebrated South Sea Bubble, was of slow growth. It had its root in the\r\nRestoration, its flower in the reign of Anne, and its fruit and\r\n_dénouement_ in the reign of George I. Before passing on from the pages of\r\nthe \"Tatler,\" we must stop for a moment to notice one or two of those\r\nplayful advertisements which Sir Richard Steele delighted in, and which,\r\nunder the disguise of fun, perhaps really afforded him excellent matter\r\nfor his journal. Here is an irresistible invitation to his fair readers:--\r\n\r\n    Any Ladies who have any particular stories of their acquaintance which\r\n    they are willing privately to make public, may send 'em by the penny\r\n    post to Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., enclosed to Mr. John Morpheu, near\r\n    Stationers' Hall.--_Tatler_, May 8, 1709.\r\n\r\nAn excellent lion's mouth this wherein to drop scandal. A still more\r\namusing instance of the fun that pervaded Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., is to\r\nbe found in the series of advertisements in which he ought to have\r\nconvinced John Partridge, the astrologer, that he really had departed this\r\nlife; an assertion which the latter persisted in denying with the most\r\nludicrous earnestness. Of these we give one from the \"Tatler\" of August\r\n24th 1710:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas an ignorant Upstart in Astrology has publicly endeavoured to\r\n    persuade the world that he is the late John Partridge, who died the 28\r\n    of March 1718, these are to certify all whom it may concern, that the\r\n    true John Partridge was not only dead at that time, but continues so\r\n    to the present day. Beware of counterfeits, for such are abroad.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant malice of the above is patent enough, but we confess we are\r\npuzzled to know whether the following is genuine or not. We copied it from\r\namong a number of others, from which it was undistinguishable by any\r\npeculiarity of type:--\r\n\r\n    _The Charitable Advice Office_, where all persons may have the opinion\r\n    of dignified Clergymen, learned Council, graduate Physicians, and\r\n    experienced Surgeons, to any question in Divinity, Morality, Law,\r\n    Physic, or Surgery, with proper Prescriptions within twelve hours\r\n    after they have delivered in a state of their case. Those who can't\r\n    write may have their cases stated at the office. * * The fees are\r\n    only 1_s._ delivery, or sending your case, and 1_s._ more on\r\n    re-delivering that and the opinion upon it, being what is thought\r\n    sufficient to defray the necessary expense of servants and\r\n    office-rent.--_Tatler_, December 16, 1710.\r\n\r\nTo pass, however, from the keen weapons of the brain to those of the\r\nflesh, it is interesting to fix with some tolerable accuracy the change\r\nwhich took place in the early part of the eighteenth century in what might\r\nbe called the amusements of the fancy. The \"noble art of defence,\" as it\r\nwas termed, up to the time of the first George seems to have consisted in\r\nthe broadsword exercise. Pepys describes in his \"Diary\" several bloody\r\nencounters of this kind which he himself witnessed; and the following\r\nadvertisement, a half-century later, shows that the skilled weapon had not\r\nat that time been set aside for the more brutal fist:--\r\n\r\n    A _Tryal of Skill_ to be performed at His Majesty's Bear Garden in\r\n    Hockley-in-the-Hole, on Thursday next, being the 9th instant, betwixt\r\n    these following masters:--Edmund Button, master of the noble science\r\n    of defence, _who hath lately cut down_ Mr. Hasgit and the Champion of\r\n    the West, _and 4 besides_, and James Harris, an Herefordshire man,\r\n    master of the noble science of defence, who has fought 98 prizes and\r\n    never was worsted, to exercise the usual weapons, at 2 o'clock in the\r\n    afternoon precisely.--_Postman_, July 4, 1701.\r\n\r\nThe savage character of the time may be judged from this public boast of\r\nMr. Edmund Button that he had cut down six men with a murderous weapon. We\r\nquestion, however, if the age which could tolerate such ruffianism was not\r\nexceeded by the change which substituted the fist for the sword, and\r\nwitnessed women entering the ring in the place of men. Some of the\r\nearliest notices of boxing-matches upon record, singularly enough, took\r\nplace between combatants of the fair sex. In a public journal of 1722, for\r\ninstance, we find the following gage of battle thrown down, and\r\naccepted:--\r\n\r\n    CHALLENGE.--I, Elizabeth Wilkinson, of Clerkenwell, having had some\r\n    words with Hannah Hyfield, and requiring satisfaction, do invite her\r\n    to meet me upon the stage, and box me for three guineas; each woman\r\n    holding half-a-crown in each hand, and the first woman that drops the\r\n    money to lose the battle.\r\n\r\n    ANSWER.--I, Hannah Hyfield, of Newgate Market, hearing of the\r\n    resoluteness of Elizabeth Wilkinson, will not fail, _God willing_, to\r\n    give her more blows than words, desiring home blows, and from her no\r\n    favour: she may expect a good thumping!\r\n\r\nThe half-crowns in the hands was an ingenious device to prevent\r\nscratching! A still more characteristic specimen of one of these\r\nchallenges to a fisticuff between two women is to be found in the _Daily\r\nPost_ of July 7th, 1728:--\r\n\r\n    At _Mr. Stokes' Amphitheatre_ in Islington Road, this present Monday,\r\n    being the 7 of October, will be a complete Boxing Match by the two\r\n    following Championesses:--Whereas I, Ann Field, of Stoke Newington,\r\n    ass-driver, well known for my abilities in boxing in my own defence\r\n    wherever it happened in my way, having been affronted by Mrs. Stokes,\r\n    styled the European Championess, do fairly invite her to a trial of\r\n    her best skill in Boxing for 10 pounds, fair rise and fall; and\r\n    question not but to give her such proofs of my judgement that shall\r\n    oblige her to acknowledge me Championess of the Stage, to the entire\r\n    satisfaction of all my friends.\r\n\r\n    I, Elizabeth Stokes, of the City of London, have not fought in this\r\n    way since I fought the famous boxing-woman of Billingsgate 29 minutes,\r\n    and gained a complete victory (which is six years ago); but as the\r\n    famous Stoke Newington ass-woman dares me to fight her for the 10\r\n    pounds, I do assure her I will not fail meeting her for the said sum,\r\n    and doubt not that the blows which I shall present her with will be\r\n    more difficult for her to digest than any she ever gave her\r\n    asses.--_Note._ A man, known by the name of Rugged and Tuff,\r\n    challenges the best man of Stoke Newington to fight him for one guinea\r\n    to what sum they please to venture. N.B. Attendance will be given at\r\n    one, and the encounter to begin at four precisely. There will be the\r\n    diversion of Cudgel-playing as usual.\r\n\r\nOther advertisements about this time relate to cock-matches, sometimes \"to\r\nlast the week,\" to bull-baiting, and, more cruel still, to dressing up mad\r\nbulls with fireworks, in order to worry them with dogs. The brutal tone of\r\nmanners, which set in afresh with the Hanoverian succession, might be\r\nalone gathered from the so-called sporting advertisements of the day; and\r\nwe now see that Hogarth, in his famous picture, had no need to, and\r\nprobably did not, draw upon his imagination for the combination of horrid\r\ncruelties therein depicted.\r\n\r\nThe very same tone pervaded the gallantry of the day, and we print two\r\nadvertisements, one of the time of Anne, and the other of the age we are\r\nnow illustrating, in order to contrast their spirit. We give the more\r\npolished one precedence:--\r\n\r\n    A gentleman who, the twentieth instant, had the honour to conduct a\r\n    lady out of a boat at Whitehall-stairs, desires to know where he may\r\n    wait on her to disclose a matter of concern. A letter directed to Mr.\r\n    Samuel Reeves, to be left with Mr. May, at the Golden Head, the upper\r\n    end of New Southampton Street, Covent Garden.--_Tatler_, March 21,\r\n    1709.\r\n\r\nA certain courtly style and air of good breeding pervades this\r\nadvertisement, of which Sir Richard Steele himself need not have been\r\nashamed; but what a falling-off is here!--\r\n\r\n    Whereas a young lady was at Covent Garden playhouse last Tuesday\r\n    night, and received a blow with a square piece of wood on her breast;\r\n    if the lady be single, and meet me on Sunday, at two o'clock, on the\r\n    Mall in St. James's Park, or send a line directed for A. B., to Mr.\r\n    Jones's, at the Sun Tavern in St. Paul's Churchyard, where and when I\r\n    shall wait on her, to inform her of something very much to her\r\n    advantage on honourable terms, her compliance will be a lasting\r\n    pleasure to her most obedient servant.--_General Advertiser_, Feb. 8,\r\n    1748.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as though the beau had been forced to resort to a missile to\r\nmake an impression, and then felt the necessity of stating that his\r\nintentions were \"honourable,\" in order to secure an interview with his\r\n_innamorata_. Imagine, too, the open unblushing manner in which the\r\nassignation is attempted! We are far from saying that such matters are not\r\nmanaged now through the medium of advertisements, for we shall presently\r\nshow they are, but in how much more carefully concealed a manner! The\r\nperfect contempt of public opinion, or rather the public acquiescence in\r\nsuch infringements of the moral law, which it exhibits, proves the general\r\nstate of morality more than the infringements themselves, which obtain\r\nmore or less at all times. Two of the causes which led to this low tone of\r\nmanners with respect to women were doubtless the detestable profligacy of\r\nthe courts of the two first Georges, and the very defective condition of\r\nthe existing marriage law. William and Mary, and Anne, had, by their\r\ndecorous, not to say frigid lives, redeemed the crown, and, in some\r\nmeasure, the aristocracy, from the vices of the Restoration. Crown, court,\r\nand quality, however, fell into a still worse slough on the accession of\r\nthe Hanoverian king, who soiled afresh the rising tone of public life by\r\nhis scandalous connection with the Duchess of Kendal and the Countess of\r\nDarlington; whilst his son and successor was absolutely abetted in his\r\nvicious courses by his own queen, who promoted his commerce with his two\r\nmistresses, the Countesses of Suffolk and Yarmouth. The degrading\r\ninfluence of the royal manners was well seconded by the condition of the\r\nlaw. Keith's chapel in May Fair, and that at the Fleet, were the Gretna\r\nGreens of the age, where children could get married at any time of the day\r\nor night for a couple of crowns. It was said at the time, that at the\r\nformer chapel six thousand persons were annually married in this off-hand\r\nway; the youngest of the beautiful Miss Gunnings was wedded to the Duke of\r\nHamilton, at twelve o'clock at night, with a ring off the bed-curtain, at\r\nthis very \"marriage-shop.\" The fruits of such unions may be imagined. The\r\neasy way in which the marriage bond was worn and broken through is clearly\r\nindicated by the advertisements which absolutely crowd the public journals\r\nfrom the accession of the House of Brunswick up to the time of the third\r\nGeorge, of husbands warning the public not to trust their runaway wives.\r\n\r\nWe have referred, in an early part of this paper, to the taste for\r\nblackamoors, which set in the reign of Charles II., and went on increasing\r\nuntil the middle of the next century, at which time there must have been a\r\nvery considerable population of negro servants in the metropolis. At first\r\nthe picturesque natives of the East were pressed into the service of the\r\nnobility and gentry, and colour does not appear to have been a _sine quâ\r\nnon_. Thus we have in the _London Gazette_ of 1688 the following\r\nhue-and-cry advertisement:--\r\n\r\n    Run away from his master, Captain St. Lo, the 21st instant, Obdelah\r\n    Ealias Abraham, a Moor, swarthy complexion, short frizzled hair, a\r\n    gold ring in his ear, in a black coat and blew breeches. He took with\r\n    him a blew Turkish watch-gown, a Turkish suit of clothing that he used\r\n    to wear about town, and several other things. Whoever brings him to\r\n    Mr. Lozel's house in Green Street shall have one guinea for his\r\n    charges.\r\n\r\nThe next advertisement we find also relates to what we must consider an\r\nEast Indian. The notion of property in these boys seems to have been\r\ncomplete; their masters put their names upon their collars, as they did\r\nupon their setters or spaniels:--\r\n\r\n    A black boy, an Indian, about thirteen years old, run away the 8th\r\n    instant from Putney, with a collar about his neck with this\r\n    inscription: 'the Lady Bromfield's black in Lincoln's Inn Fields.'\r\n    Whoever brings him to Sir Edward Bromfield's at Putney shall have a\r\n    guinea reward.--_The London Gazette_, 1694.\r\n\r\nThe traffic in African blacks, which commenced towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, seems to have displaced these eastern servitors\r\ntowards the end of the century, for henceforth the word negro, blackamoor,\r\nor black boy, is invariably used. No doubt the fashion for these negroes\r\nand other coloured attendants was derived from the Venetian Republic, the\r\nintercourse of whose merchants with Africa and India naturally led to\r\ntheir introduction. Titian and other great painters of his school\r\ncontinually introduced them in their pictures, and our own great bard has\r\nfor ever associated the Moor with the City in the Sea. In England the\r\nnegro boys appear to have been considered as much articles of sale as they\r\nwould have been in the slave-market at Constantinople. In the _Tatler_ of\r\n1709 we find one offered to the public in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    A black boy, twelve years of age, fit to wait on a gentleman, to be\r\n    disposed of at Denis's Coffee-house in Finch Lane, near the Royal\r\n    Exchange.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _Daily Journal_ of September 28th, 1728, we light upon\r\nanother:--\r\n\r\n    To be sold, a negro boy, aged eleven years. Enquire of the Virginia\r\n    Coffee-house in Threadneedle Street, behind the Royal Exchange.\r\n\r\nThese were the overflowings of that infamous traffic in negroes, commenced\r\nby Sir John Hawkins in the year 1680, which tore from their homes, and\r\ntransferred to Jamaica alone, no less than 910,000 Africans between that\r\ntime and the year 1786, when the slave-trade was abolished.\r\n\r\nWe have brought the reader up to the date of the final battle which\r\nextinguished the hopes of the Stuarts and settled the line of Brunswick\r\nfirmly on the throne. The year 1745 witnessed the commencement of the\r\n_General Advertiser_, the title of which indicates the purpose to which it\r\nwas dedicated. This paper was the first successful attempt to depend for\r\nsupport upon the advertisements it contained, thereby creating a new era\r\nin the newspaper press. From the very outset its columns were filled with\r\nthem, between fifty and sixty, regularly classified and separated by\r\nrules, appearing in each publication; in fact, the advertising page put on\r\nfor the first time a modern look. The departure of ships is constantly\r\nnotified, and the engravings of these old high-pooped vessels sail in even\r\nline down the column. Trading matters have at last got the upper hand. You\r\nsee \"a pair of leather bags,\" \"a scarlet laced-coat,\" \"a sword,\" still\r\ninquired after; and theatres make a show, for this was the dawning of the\r\nage of Foote, Macklin, Garrick, and most of the other great players of the\r\nlast century; but, comparatively speaking, the gaieties and follies of the\r\ntown ceased gradually from this time to proclaim themselves through the\r\nmedium of advertisements. The great earthquake at Lisbon so frightened the\r\npeople, that masquerades were prohibited by law, and the puppet-shows, the\r\nrope-dancing, the china-auctions, and public breakfasts henceforth grow\r\nscarcer and scarcer as the Ladies Betty and Sally, who inaugurated them,\r\nwithdrew by degrees, withered, faded, and patched, from the scene.\r\n\r\nThe only signs of the political tendencies of the time to be gathered from\r\nthe sources we are pursuing, are the party dinners, announcements of which\r\nare now and then to be met with as follows:--\r\n\r\n    To the Joyous.--The Bloods are desired to meet together at the house\r\n    known by the name of the Sir Hugh Middleton, near Saddler's Wells,\r\n    Islington, which Mr. Skeggs has procured for that day for the better\r\n    entertainment of those Gentlemen who agreed to meet at his own house.\r\n    Dinner will be on the Table punctually at two o'clock.--_General\r\n    Advertiser_, Jan. 13, 1748.\r\n\r\nOr the following still more characteristic example from the same paper of\r\nApril 12:--\r\n\r\n    Half-Moon Tavern, Cheapside.--Saturday next, the 16 of April, being\r\n    the anniversary of the Glorious Battle of Colloden, the Stars will\r\n    assemble in the Moon at Six in the evening. Therefore the Choice\r\n    Spirits are desired to make their appearance and fill up the\r\n    joy.--ENDYMION.\r\n\r\nWithin five-and-twenty years from this date most of the existing morning\r\njournals were established, and their advertising columns put on a guise\r\nclosely resembling that which they now present. We need not therefore\r\npursue our deep trenching into the old subsoil in order to turn up\r\nlong-buried evidences of manners and fashions, for they have ceased to\r\nappear, either fossil or historical; we therefore boldly leap the gulf\r\nthat intervenes between these old days and the present.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the present century saw the commencement of that liberal\r\nand systematic plan of advertising which marks the complete era in the\r\nart. Princely ideas by degrees took possession of the trading mind as to\r\nthe value of this new agent in extending their business transactions.\r\nPackwood, some thirty years ago, led the way by impressing his razor-strop\r\nindelibly on the mind of every bearded member of the empire. Like other\r\ngreat potentates he boasted a laureate in his pay, and every one remembers\r\nthe reply made to the individuals curious to know who drew up his\r\nadvertisements: \"La, sir, we keeps a poet!\"\r\n\r\nBy universal consent, however, the world has accorded to the late George\r\nRobins the palm in this style of commercial puffing. His advertisements\r\nwere really artistically written. Like Martin, he had the power of\r\ninvesting every landscape and building he touched with an importance and\r\nmajesty not attainable by meaner hands. He did perhaps go beyond the\r\nyielding line of even poetical license, when he described one portion of a\r\nparadise he was about to submit to public competition as adorned, among\r\nother charms, with a \"hanging wood,\" which the astonished purchaser found\r\nout meant nothing more than an old gallows. But then he redeemed slight\r\nmanoeuvres of this kind by touches which really displayed a genius for\r\npuffing. On one occasion he had made the beauties of an estate so\r\nenchanting, that he found it necessary to blur it by a fault or two, lest\r\nit should prove too bright and good \"for human nature's daily food.\" \"But\r\nthere are two drawbacks to the property,\" sighed out this Hafiz of the\r\nMart, \"the litter of the rose-leaves and the noise of the nightingales!\"\r\nCertainly the force of exquisite puffing could no further go, and when he\r\ndied the poetry of advertising departed. Others, such as Charles Wright\r\nof Champagne celebrity, have attempted to strike the strings; and Moses\r\ndoes, we believe, veritably keep a poet; but none of them have been able\r\nto rival George the Great, and we yawn as we read sonnets which end in the\r\ninvariable \"mart,\" or acrostics which refer to Hyam and Co.'s superior\r\nvests. Twenty years ago some of the daily newspapers admitted illustrated\r\nadvertisements into their columns; now it would be fatal to any of them to\r\ndo so. Nevertheless, they are by far the most effective of their class, as\r\nthey call in the aid of another sense to express their meaning. All but\r\nthe minors of the present generation must remember George Cruikshank's\r\nexquisite woodcut of the astonished cat viewing herself in the polished\r\nHessian, which made the fortune of Warren. But in those days tradesmen\r\nonly tried their wings for the flight. It was left to the present time to\r\nprove what unlimited confidence in the power of the advertisement will\r\neffect, and a short list of the sums _annually_ spent in this item by some\r\nof the most adventurous dealers will perhaps startle our readers.\r\n\r\n  \"Professor\" Holloway, Pills, etc.        £30,000\r\n  Moses and Son                             10,000\r\n  Rowland and Co. (Macassar oil, &c.)       10,000\r\n  Dr. De Jongh (cod-liver oil)              10,000\r\n  Heal and Sons (bedsteads and bedding)      6,000\r\n  Nicholls (tailor)                          4,500\r\n\r\nIt does seem indeed incredible that one house should expend upon the mere\r\nadvertising of quack pills and ointment a sum equal to the entire revenue\r\nof many a German principality. Can it possibly pay? asks the astonished\r\nreader. Let the increasing avenue of assistants, to be seen \"from morn to\r\ndewy eve\" wrapping up pills in the \"professor's\" establishment within the\r\nshadow of Temple Bar, supply the answer.[2] Vastly as the press of this\r\ncountry has expanded of late years, it has proved insufficient to contain\r\nwithin its limits the rapid current of puffing which has set in.\r\nAdvertisements now overflow into our omnibuses, our cabs, our railway\r\ncarriages, and our steamboats. Madame Tussaud pays 90_l._ monthly to the\r\nAtlas Omnibus Company alone for the privilege of posting her bills in\r\ntheir vehicles. They are inked upon the pavement, painted in large letters\r\nunder the arches of the bridges and on every dead wall. Lloyd's weekly\r\nnewspaper is stamped on the \"full Guelph cheek\" of the plebeian penny; the\r\nemissaries of Moses shower perfect libraries through the windows of the\r\ncarriages which ply from the railway stations; and, as a crowning fact,\r\nThackeray, in his \"Journey from Cornhill to Cairo,\" tells us that Warren's\r\nblacking is painted up over an obliterated inscription to Psammetichus on\r\nPompey's Pillar!\r\n\r\nHaving shown the reader the slow growth of the advertising column; having\r\nclimbed, like \"Jack in the Bean-stalk,\" from its humble root in the days\r\nof the Commonwealth up its still increasing stem in the succeeding hundred\r\nyears, we now come upon its worthy flower in the shape of the\r\nsixteen-paged _Times_ of the present day. Spread open its broad leaves,\r\nand behold the greatest marvel of the age--the microcosm in type. Who can\r\nrecognize in its ample surface, which reflects like some camera-obscura\r\nthe wants, the wishes, the hopes, and the fears of this great city, the\r\nnews-book of the Cromwellian times with its leash of advertisements?\r\nHerein we see how fierce is the struggle of two millions and a half of\r\npeople for dear existence. Every advertisement writhes and fights with its\r\nneighbour, and every phase of society, brilliant, broken, or dim, is\r\nreflected in this battle-field of life. Let us tell off the rank and file\r\nof this army of announcements. On the 24th of May, 1855, the _Times_, in\r\nits usual sixteen-paged paper, contained the incredible number of 2,575\r\nadvertisements. Amazing as this total appears, we only arrive at its full\r\nsignificance by analyzing the vast array. Then, indeed, we feel what an\r\nimportant power is the great British publie. Of old the antechambers of\r\nthe noble were thronged with poets, artists, publishers, tradesmen, and\r\ndependants of all kinds, seeking for the droppings of their favour; but\r\nwhat lordly antechamber ever presented such a crew of place-hunters,\r\nservitors, literary and scientific men, schemers, and shopkeepers as\r\ndaily offer their services to the humblest individual who can spare a\r\npenny for an hour's perusal of the _Times_? Let us take this paper of the\r\n24th of May and examine the crowd of persons and things which cry aloud\r\nthrough its pages, each attempting to make its voice heard above the\r\nother. Here we see a noble fleet of ships, 129 in number, chartered for\r\nthe regions of gold, for America, for India, for Africa--for every port,\r\nin fact, where cupidity, duty, or affection holds out an attraction for\r\nthe British race. Another column wearies the eye with its interminable\r\nline of \"Wants.\" Here in long and anxious row we see the modern \"mop\" or\r\nstatute-fair for hiring; 429 servants of all grades, from the genteel\r\nlady's-maid or the \"thorough cook,\" who will only condescend to accept\r\nservice where two footmen are kept, to the humble scullery-maid, on that\r\nday passed their claims before us for inspection. Another column is noisy\r\nwith auctioneers; 136 of whom notify their intention of poising their\r\nimpatient hammers when we have favoured them with our company. Here we see\r\na crowd of booksellers offering, hot from the press, 195 new volumes, many\r\nof which, we are assured by the appended critique, \"should find a place in\r\nevery gentleman's library.\" There are 378 houses, shops, and\r\nestablishments presented to us to select from; and 144 lodging-house\r\nkeepers, \"ladies having houses larger than they require,\" and medical men\r\nwho own \"retreats,\" press forward with genteel offers of board and\r\nlodging. Education pursues her claims by the hands of no less than 144\r\npreceptors, male and female; whilst the hair, the skin, the feet, the\r\nteeth, and the inward man are offered the kind attention of thirty-six\r\nprofessors who possess infallible remedies for all the ills that flesh is\r\nheir to. The remainder is made up of the miscellaneous cries of tradesmen,\r\nwhose voices rise from every portion of the page like the shouting of\r\nchapmen from a fair. In the midst of all this struggle for gold, place,\r\nand position, which goes on every day in this wonderful publication,\r\noutcries from the very depths of the heart, passionate tears, bursts of\r\nindignation, and heartrending appeals, startle one as they issue from the\r\nsecond column of its front page. Here the father sees his prodigal son\r\nafar off and falls upon his neck; the heartbroken mother implores her\r\nrunaway child to return; or the abandoned wife searches through the world\r\nfor her mate. It is strange how, when the eye is saturated with the thirst\r\nafter mammon exhibited by the rest of the broadsheet, the heart becomes\r\ntouched by these plaintive but searching utterances, a few of which we\r\nreproduce:--\r\n\r\n    The one-winged Dove must die unless the Crane returns to be a shield\r\n    against her enemies.--_Times_ of 1850.\r\n\r\nOr here is another which moves still more:--\r\n\r\n    B. J. C.--How more than cruel not to write. Take pity on such patient\r\n    silence.--_Times_, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe most ghastly advertisement which perhaps ever appeared in a public\r\njournal we copy from this paper of the year 1845. It is either a threat to\r\ninter a wrong body in the \"family vault,\" or an address to a dead man:--\r\n\r\n    To the Party who Posts His Letters in Prince's Street, Leicester\r\n    Square.--Your family is now in a state of excitement unbearable. Your\r\n    attention is called to an advertisement in Wednesday's _Morning\r\n    Advertiser_, headed, \"A body found drowned at Deptford.\" After your\r\n    avowal to your friend as to what you might do, he has been to see the\r\n    decomposed remains, accompanied by others. The features are gone; but\r\n    there are marks on the arm; so that, unless they hear from you to-day,\r\n    it will satisfy them that the remains are those of their misguided\r\n    relative, and steps will be directly taken to place them in the family\r\n    vault, as they cannot bear the idea of a pauper's funeral.\r\n\r\nSometimes we see the flashing eyes of indignation gleaming through the\r\nvery words. The following is evidently written to an old lover with all\r\nthe burning passion of a woman deceived:--\r\n\r\n    It is enough; one man alone upon earth have I found noble. Away from\r\n    me for ever! Cold heart and mean spirit, you have lost what\r\n    millions--empires--could not have bought, but which a single word\r\n    truthfully and nobly spoken might have made your own to all eternity.\r\n    Yet you are forgiven: depart in peace: I rest in my\r\n    Redeemer.--_Times_, Sept. 1st, 1852.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is more confiding love \"wafting a sigh from Indus to the\r\npole,\" or, finger on lip, speaking secretly, and as he thinks securely,\r\nthrough the medium of cipher advertisements to the loved one. Sweet\r\ndelusion! There are wicked philosophers abroad who unstring the bow of\r\nharder toil by picking your inmost thoughts! Lovers beware! intriguers\r\ntremble! Many a wicked passage of illicit love, many a joy fearfully\r\nsnatched, which passed through the second column of the first page of the\r\n_Times_ as a string of disjointed letters, unintelligible as the\r\ncorrespondents thought, to all the world but themselves, have we seen\r\nfairly copied out in plain if not always good English in the commonplace\r\nbooks of these cunning men at cryptographs. Here, for instance, we give an\r\nepisode from the life of \"Flo,\" which appeared in the _Times_ of 1853-54,\r\nas a proof:--\r\n\r\n    Flo.--Thou voice of my heart! Berlin, Thursday. I leave next Monday,\r\n    and shall press you to my heart on Saturday. God bless you!--_Nov. 29,\r\n    1853._\r\n\r\n    Flo.--The last is wrong. I repeat it. Thou voice of my heart. I am so\r\n    lonely, I miss you more than ever. I look at your picture every night.\r\n    I send you an Indian shawl to wear round you while asleep after\r\n    dinner. It will keep you from harm, and you must fancy my arms are\r\n    around you. God bless you! how I do love you!--_Dec. 23, 1853._\r\n\r\n    Flo.--My own love, I am happy again; it is like awaking from a bad\r\n    dream. You are, my life; to know that there is a chance of seeing you,\r\n    to hear from you, to do things to enough. [There is some error here.]\r\n    I shall try to see you soon. Write to me as often as you can. God\r\n    bless you, thou voice of my heart!--_Jan. 2, 1854._\r\n\r\n    Flo.--Thou voice of my heart! How I do love you! How are you? Shall\r\n    you be laid up this spring? I can see you walking with your darling.\r\n    What would I give to be with you! Thanks for your last letter. I fear\r\n    nothing but separation from you. You are my world, my life, my hope.\r\n    Thou more than life, farewell! God bless you!--_Jan. 6, 1854._\r\n\r\n    Flo.--I fear, dearest, our cipher is discovered: write at once to your\r\n    friend \"Indian Shawl\" (P.O.), Buckingham, Bucks.--_Jan. 7, 1845._\r\n\r\nThe advertisement of January 7th is written in a great fright, and refers\r\nto the discovery and exposure of the cipher in the _Times_ newspaper; for\r\nwhenever the aforesaid philosophers perceive that a secret correspondence\r\nhas arrived at a critical point they charitably insert a marplot\r\nadvertisement in the same cipher. The \"Flo\" intrigue was carried on in\r\nfigures, the key to which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9\r\n  y.   u.   o.   i.   e.   a.   d.   k.   h.   f.\r\n  s.   t.   n.   m.   r.   l.   d.   g.   w.   p.\r\n  x.                                 c.   b.\r\n                                          v.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps remember another mad-looking advertisement which\r\nappeared in the year 1853, headed \"Cenerentola.\" The first, dated Feb.\r\n2nd, we interpret thus:--\r\n\r\n    Cenerentola, I wish to try if you can read this, and am most anxious\r\n    to hear the end, when you return, and how long you remain here. Do\r\n    write a few lines, darling, please: I have been very far from happy\r\n    since you went away.\r\n\r\nOne of the parties cannot frame an adequate explanation of some delicate\r\nmatter clearly, as we find on the 11th the following:--\r\n\r\n    Cenerentola, until my heart is sick have I tried to frame an\r\n    explanation for you, but cannot. Silence is safest, if the true cause\r\n    is not suspected; if it is, all stories will be sifted to the bottom.\r\n    Do you remember our cousin's first proposition?--think of it.\r\n\r\nThe following, which appeared on the 19th of the same month, is written in\r\nplain language, and is evidently a specimen of the marplot advertisement\r\nbefore alluded to:--\r\n\r\n    Cenerentola, what nonsense! Your cousin's proposition is absurd. I\r\n    have given an explanation--the true one--which has perfectly satisfied\r\n    both parties--a thing which silence never could have effected. So no\r\n    more such absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe secret of this cipher consisted in representing each letter by the\r\ntwenty-second onward continually. One more specimen of these singular\r\nadvertisements and we have done. On Feb. 20, 1852, there appeared in the\r\n_Times_ the following mysterious line:--\r\n\r\n    Tig tjohw it tig jfhiirvola og tig psgvw.--F. D. N.\r\n\r\nThe general reader, doubtless, looked upon this jumble of letters with\r\nsome such a puzzled air as the mastiff gives the tortoise in a very\r\npopular French bronze; but not being able to make anything out of it,\r\npassed on to the more intelligible contents of the paper. A friend of\r\nours, however, was curious and intelligent enough to extract the plain\r\nEnglish out of it, though not without much trouble, as thus:--If we take\r\nthe first word of the sentence, Tig, and place under its second letter i\r\nthe one which alphabetically precedes it, and treat the next letters in a\r\nsimilar manner, we shall have the following combination:--\r\n\r\n  T  i  g\r\n     h  f\r\n        e\r\n\r\nReading the first letters obliquely we have the article \"The;\" if we treat\r\nthe second word in the same manner, the following will be the result:--\r\n\r\n  T   j   o   h   w\r\n      i.  n.  g.  v.\r\n          m.  f.  u.\r\n              e.  t.\r\n                  s.\r\n\r\nwhich, read in the same slanting way, produces the word _Times_, and the\r\nwhole sentence, thus ingeniously worked out, gives up its latent and\r\nextraordinary meaning, thus--\r\n\r\n    \"The _Times_ is the Jefferies of the press.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could have induced any one to take so much trouble thus to plant a\r\nhidden insult into the leading journal, we cannot divine. \"East,\" \"He\r\nBlew,\" \"Willie and Fanny,\" \"Dominoes,\" and \"My darling A.,\" need not feel\r\nuncomfortable although we know their secrets. We have said quite enough to\r\nprove to these individuals that such ciphers as they use, are picked\r\nimmediately by any cryptographic Hobbs; indeed, all systems of writing\r\nwhich depend upon transmutations of the letters of the alphabet, or the\r\nsubstitution of figures for letters, such as we generally find in the\r\n_Times_, are mere puzzles for children, and not worthy of the more cunning\r\nor finished in the art.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected, with all the caution exhibited by the morning\r\npapers to prevent the insertion of swindling advertisements that rogues do\r\nnot now and then manage to take advantage of their great circulation for\r\nthe sake of forwarding their own nefarious schemes. Sir Robert Carden has\r\njust done good service by running to earth the Mr. Fynn, who for years has\r\nlived abroad in splendour at the expense of the poor governesses he\r\nmanaged to victimize through the advertising columns of the _Times_. One's\r\nheart sickens at the stream of poor young ladies his promises have dragged\r\nacross the continent, and the consequences which may have resulted from\r\ntheir thus putting their reputation as well as their money into his power.\r\nSuch scandalous traps as these are, of course, rare; but the papers are\r\nfull of minor pitfalls, into which the unwary are continually falling,\r\nsometimes with their eyes wide open. Of the latter class are the\r\nmatrimonial advertisements; here is a specimen of one of the most artful\r\nof its kind we ever remember to have seen:--\r\n\r\n    To Girls of Fortune--Matrimony.--A bachelor, young, amiable, handsome,\r\n    and of good family, and accustomed to move in the highest sphere of\r\n    society, is embarrassed in his circumstances. Marriage is his only\r\n    hope of extrication. This advertisement is inserted by one of his\r\n    friends. Ingratitude was never one of his faults, and he will study\r\n    for the remainder of his life to prove his estimation of the\r\n    confidence placed in him.--Address, post-paid, L. L. H. L., 47, King\r\n    Street, Soho.--N.B. The witticisms of cockney scribblers deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe air of candour, and the taking portrait of the handsome bachelor,\r\nwhose very poverty is converted into a charm, is cleverly assumed. An\r\nannouncement of a much less flattering kind, but probably of a more\r\ngenuine and honourable nature, was published in _Blackwood_ some time ago,\r\nwhich we append, as, like Landseer's dog-pictures, the two form a capital\r\npair illustrative of high and low life.\r\n\r\n    Matrimonial Advertisement.--I hereby give notice to all unmarried\r\n    women, that I, John Hobnail, am at this writing five-and-forty, a\r\n    widower, and in want of a wife. As I wish no one to be mistaken, I\r\n    have a good cottage, with a couple of acres of land, for which I pay\r\n    2_l._ a year. I have five children, four of them old enough to be in\r\n    employment; three sides of bacon, and some pigs ready for market. I\r\n    should like to have a woman fit to take care of her house when I am\r\n    out. I want no second family. She may be between forty and fifty if\r\n    she likes. A good sterling woman would be preferred, who would take\r\n    care of the pigs.\r\n\r\nThe following is also matter of fact, but it looks suspicious:--\r\n\r\n    Matrimony to Milliners and Dressmakers. A young man about to EMIGRATE\r\n    to SOUTH AUSTRALIA would be happy to form an alliance with a young\r\n    woman in the above line possessing 60_l._ or 100_l._ property. Any one\r\n    so disposed, by applying by letter (post-paid) to T. Hall, 175, Upper\r\n    Thames Street, till Saturday next, appointing an interview, may depend\r\n    on prompt attention and strict secrecy.--_Times_, 1845.\r\n\r\nThe matrimonial bait is so obviously a good one, that of late years we see\r\nadvertisements of institutions, at which regular lists of candidates for\r\nthe marriage state, both male and female, are kept, together with\r\nportraits, and a ledger in which pecuniary and mental qualifications are\r\nneatly posted. Such springes are only suited, however, for the grossest\r\nfolly; but there is another class of advertisements which empties the\r\npockets of the industrious and aspiring in a very workmanlike manner: we\r\nallude to such as the following:--\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen having a respectable circle of acquaintance may hear of\r\n    means of INCREASING their INCOME without the slightest pecuniary risk,\r\n    or of having (by any chance) their feelings wounded. Apply for\r\n    particulars, by letter, stating their position, &c., to W. R., 37,\r\n    Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square.\r\n\r\nGentlemen whose feelings are so delicate that they must not be injured on\r\nany consideration, who nevertheless have a desire for lucre, we recommend\r\nnot to apply to such persons, unless they wish to receive for their pains\r\nsome such a scheme as was forwarded to a person who had answered an\r\nadvertisement (enclosing, as directed, thirty postage-stamps) in _Lloyd's\r\nWeekly Journal_, headed \"How to make 2_l._ per week by the outlay of\r\n10_s._\":--\r\n\r\n    \"First purchase 1 cwt. of large-sized potatoes, which may be obtained\r\n    for the sum of 4_s._, then purchase a large basket, which will cost\r\n    say another 4_s._, then buy 2_s._ worth of flannel blanketing, and\r\n    this will comprise your stock in trade, of which the total cost is\r\n    10_s._ A large-sized potato weighs about half a pound, consequently\r\n    there are 224 potatoes in a cwt.\r\n\r\n    \"Take half the above quantity of potatoes each evening to a baker's,\r\n    and have them baked; when properly cooked put them in your basket,\r\n    well wrapped up in the flannel to keep them hot, and sally forth and\r\n    offer them for sale at one penny each. Numbers will be glad to\r\n    purchase them at that price, and you will for certain be able to sell\r\n    half a cwt. every evening. From the calculation made below you will\r\n    see by that means you will be able to earn 2_l._ per week. The best\r\n    plan is to frequent the most crowded thoroughfares, and make good use\r\n    of your lungs; thus letting people know what you have for sale. You\r\n    could also call in at each public-house on your way, and solicit the\r\n    patronage of the customers, many of whom would be certain to buy of\r\n    you. Should you have too much pride to transact the business yourself\r\n    (though no one need be ashamed of pursuing an honest calling), you\r\n    could hire a boy for a few shillings a week, who could do the work for\r\n    you, and you could still make a handsome profit weekly.\r\n\r\n    \"The following calculation proves that 2_l._ per week can be made by\r\n    selling baked potatoes:--\r\n\r\n        \"1 cwt., containing 224 potatoes, sold in two\r\n        evenings, at 1_d._ each                  £0 18 8\r\n                         Deduct cost                   0  4 0\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                                                      £0 14 8\r\n                                                            3\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                         Six evenings' sale           £2  4 0\r\n        Pay baker at the rate of 8_d._ per evening for\r\n        baking potatoes                                0  4 0\r\n                                                      -------\r\n                         Net profit per week          £2  0 0\"\r\n\r\nOne more specimen of these baits for gudgeon, and we have done. We\r\nfrequently see appeals to the benevolent for the loans of small sums. Some\r\nof these are doubtless written by innocent persons in distress, who\r\nconfide in the good side of human nature; and we have been given to\r\nunderstand that in many cases this blind confidence has not been\r\nmisplaced; for there are many Samaritans who read the papers nowadays, and\r\nfeel a romantic pleasure in answering such appeals: at the same time, we\r\nare afraid that the great majority of them are gross deceptions. The\r\nveritable whine of \"the poor broken-down tradesman\" who makes a habit of\r\nvisiting our quiet streets and appealing, in a very solemn voice, to \"my\r\nbrethren\" for the loan of a small trifle, whilst he anxiously scans the\r\nwindows for the halfpence, is observable, for instance, in the following\r\ncool appeal:--\r\n\r\n    To the Benevolent.--A Young Tradesman has, from a series of\r\n    misfortunes, been reduced to the painful necessity of asking for a\r\n    trifling SUM to enable him to raise 10_l._ to save himself from\r\n    inevitable ruin and poverty; or if any gentleman would lend the above\r\n    it would be faithfully repaid. Satisfactory references as to the\r\n    genuineness of this case.--Direct to A.Z., Mr. Rigby's, Post-Office,\r\n    Mile-end Road.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of conscience-money is constantly acknowledged in\r\nadvertisements by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day, and the sums\r\nwhich in this manner find their way into the Exchequer are by no means\r\ninconsiderable. It is honourable to human nature, amid all the roguery we\r\nhave exposed, to find that now and then some conscience is touched by a\r\nvery small matter, and that great trouble and no little expense is often\r\ngone to in order that others may not suffer through the inadvertency or\r\ncarelessness of the advertiser. The following is a delicate example:--\r\n\r\n    To Hackney-Coachmen.--About the month of March last, a gentleman from\r\n    the country took a coach from Finsbury Square, and accidentally broke\r\n    the glass of one of its windows. Being unwell at the time, the\r\n    circumstance was forgotten when he quitted the coach, and it would now\r\n    be a great relief to his mind to be put in a situation to pay the\r\n    coachman for it. Should this meet the eye of the person who drove the\r\n    coach, and he will make application to A. B., at Walker's Hotel, Dean\r\n    Street, Soho, any morning during the next week, before eleven o'clock,\r\n    proper attention will be paid to it.--_Times_, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe more curious advertisements which from time to time appear in the\r\npublic journals, but particularly in the _Times_, do not admit of\r\nclassification; and they are so numerous, moreover, that if we were to\r\ncomment upon one tithe of those that have appeared within the last six\r\nyears, we should far exceed the limits of this article. We make no\r\napology, therefore, for stringing together the following very odd lot:--\r\n\r\n    Do you want a servant?--Necessity prompts the question.--The\r\n    advertiser OFFERS his SERVICES to any lady or gentleman, company, or\r\n    others, in want of a truly faithful confidential servant in any\r\n    capacity not menial, where a practical knowledge of human nature, in\r\n    various parts of the world, would be available. Could undertake any\r\n    affair of small or great importance, where talent, inviolable secrecy,\r\n    or good address would be necessary. Has moved in the best and worst\r\n    societies without being contaminated by either; has never been a\r\n    servant; begs to recommend himself as one who knows his place; is\r\n    moral, temperate, middle-aged; no objection to any part of the world.\r\n    Could advise any capitalist wishing to increase his income, and have\r\n    the control of his own money. Could act as secretary or valet to any\r\n    lady or gentleman. Can give advice or hold his tongue, sing, dance,\r\n    play, fence, box, or preach a sermon, tell a story, be grave or gay,\r\n    ridiculous or sublime, or do anything, from the curling of a peruke to\r\n    the storming of a citadel, but never to excel his master.--Address, A.\r\n    B. C., 7, Little St. Andrew Street, Leicester Square.--_Times_, 1850.\r\n\r\n    The Mighty Angel's Midnight Roar.--\"Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go\r\n    ye out to meet him.\" This awful cry, as is demonstrated, will very\r\n    shortly be heard, viz.: at the commencement of \"the great day (or\r\n    year) of God's wrath,\" or the last of the 2,300 days (or years) in\r\n    Daniel's prophecy. By the authors of \"Proofs of the Second Coming of\r\n    Messiah at the Passover in 1848.\" Price 6_d._ Fourth Edition.\r\n\r\nThis is a Muggletonian prophecy of the destruction of the world at a\r\ncertain date. The prediction failed, however, and the prophet found it\r\nnecessary to explain the reason:--\r\n\r\n    The Mighty Angel's Midnight Roar.--The authors, owing to their\r\n    disappointment, most sedulously investigated its cause, and instantly\r\n    announce its discovery. Daniel's vision, in chap. 8, was for 2,300\r\n    years, to the end of which (see 5-12) the \"little horn\" was to\r\n    practise and prosper, after which comes the year of God's wrath, which\r\n    was erroneously included in the 2,300 years, and thus the midnight cry\r\n    will be a year later than stated.--_Times_, 1851.\r\n\r\n    To P. Q. How Is Your Mother? I shan't inquire further, and must\r\n    decline entering upon the collateral branches of the family.--_Times_,\r\n    1842.\r\n\r\n    To Widowers and Single Gentlemen.--WANTED, by a lady, a SITUATION to\r\n    superintend the household and preside at table. She is agreeable,\r\n    becoming, careful, desirable, English, facetious, generous, honest,\r\n    industrious, judicious, keen, lively, merry, natty, obedient,\r\n    philosophic, quiet, regular, sociable, tasteful, useful, vivacious,\r\n    womanish, xantippish, youthful, zealous, &c.--Address, X. Y. Z.,\r\n    Simmond's Library, Edgeware Road.--_Times._\r\n\r\n    The Title of an Ancient Baron. Mr. George Robins is empowered to SELL\r\n    the TITLE and DIGNITY of a BARON. The origin of the family, its\r\n    ancient descent, and illustrious ancestry, will be fully developed to\r\n    those and such only as desire to possess this distinguished rank for\r\n    the inconsiderable sum of 1,000_l._ Covent-garden Market.--_Times_,\r\n    1841.\r\n\r\n    Postage stamps. A young lady, being desirous of covering her\r\n    dressing-room with cancelled POSTAGE STAMPS, has been so far\r\n    encouraged in her wish by private friends as to have succeeded in\r\n    collecting 16,000! these, however, being insufficient, she will be\r\n    greatly obliged if any good-natured persons who may have these\r\n    (otherwise useless) little articles at their disposal would assist in\r\n    her whimsical project. Address to E. D., Mr. Butt's, glover,\r\n    Leadenhall Street; or Mr. Marshall's, jeweller, Hackney.--_Times_,\r\n    1841.\r\n\r\n    To the Theatrical Profession.--WANTED, for a Summer Theatre and\r\n    Circuit, a Leading Lady, Singing Chambermaid, First Low Comedian,\r\n    Heavy Man, Walking Gentleman, and one or two Gentlemen for Utility. To\r\n    open July 9th.\r\n\r\n    Address (enclosing Stamp for reply) to Mr. J. WINDSOR, Theatre Royal,\r\n    Preston, Lancashire.--_Era_, July 1, 1855.\r\n\r\n    Wanted a Man and his Wife to look after a Horse and Dairy with a\r\n    religious turn of mind without any incumbrance.\r\n\r\nThe variety is perhaps as astonishing as the number of advertisements in\r\nthe _Times_. Like the trunk of an elephant, no matter seems too minute or\r\ntoo gigantic, too ludicrous or too sad, to be lifted into notoriety by the\r\ngiant of Printing-house Square. The partition of a thin rule suffices to\r\nseparate a call for the loan of millions from the sad weak cry of the\r\ndestitute gentlewoman to be allowed to slave in a nursery \"for the sake of\r\na home.\" Vehement love sends its voice imploring through the world after a\r\ngraceless boy, side by side with the announcement of the landing of a\r\ncargo of lively turtle, or the card of a bug-killer. The poor lady who\r\nadvertises for boarders \"merely for the sake of society\" finds her \"want\"\r\ncheek-by-jowl with some Muggletonian announcement gratuitously calculated\r\nto break up society altogether, to the effect that the world will come to\r\nan end by the middle of the next month. Or the reader is informed that for\r\ntwelve postage stamps he may learn \"How to obtain a certain fortune,\"\r\nexactly opposite an offer of a bonus of 500_l._ to any one who will obtain\r\nfor the advertiser \"a Government situation.\" The _Times_ reflects every\r\nwant, and appeals to every motive which affects our composite society. And\r\nwhy does it do this? Because of its ubiquity: go where we will, there,\r\nlike the house-fly or the sparrow, we find it. The porter reads it in his\r\nbeehive-chair, the master in his library; Green, we have no doubt, takes\r\nit with him to the clouds in his balloon, and the collier reads it in the\r\ndepths of the mine; the workman at his bench, the lodger in his two-pair\r\nback, the gold-digger in his hole, and the soldier in the trench, pore\r\nover its broad pages. Hot from the press, or months old, still it is read.\r\nThat it is, _par excellence_, the national paper, and reflects more than\r\nany other the life of the people, may be gathered from its circulation.\r\nThey show in the editor's room a singular diagram, which indicates by an\r\nirregular line the circulation day by day and year by year. On this sheet\r\nthe gusts of political feeling and the pressure of popular excitement are\r\nas minutely indicated as the force and direction of the wind are shown by\r\nthe self-registering apparatus in Lloyd's Rooms. Thus we find that in the\r\nyear 1845 it ran along at a pretty nearly dead level of 23,000 copies\r\ndaily. In 1846--for one day, the 28th of January, that on which the report\r\nof Sir Robert Peel's statement respecting the Corn Laws appeared--it rose\r\nin a towering peak to a height of 51,000, and then fell again to its old\r\nnumber. It began the year 1848 with 29,000, and rose to 43,000 on the 29th\r\nof February--the morrow of the French revolution. In 1852 its level at\r\nstarting was 36,000, and it attained to the highest point it has yet\r\ntouched on the 19th of November, the day of the Memoir of the Great Duke,\r\nwhen 69,000 copies were sold. In January, 1853, the level had arisen to\r\n40,000; and at the commencement of the present year it stood at 58,000, a\r\ncirculation which has since increased to 60,000 copies daily!\r\nNotwithstanding all the disturbing causes which make the line of its\r\ncirculation present the appearance of hill and dale, sometimes rising into\r\nAlp-like elevations, its ordinary level at the beginning of each year for\r\nsome time past has constantly gone on advancing; insomuch that within ten\r\nyears its circulation has more than doubled by 7,000 daily.\r\n\r\nThis vigorous growth is the true cause of that wonderful determination of\r\nadvertisements to its pages, which have overflowed into a second paper, or\r\nsupplement, as it was formerly called. That this success has been fairly\r\nwon, we have never ourselves doubted; but a fact has come to our knowledge\r\nwhich will pretty clearly prove that this great paper is conducted on\r\nprinciples which are superior to mere money considerations; or rather its\r\noperations are so large that it can afford to inflict upon itself\r\npecuniary losses, such as would annihilate any other journal, in order to\r\ntake a perfectly free course. In the year 1845, when the railway mania was\r\nat its height, the _Times_ advertising sheet was overrun with projected\r\nlines, and many a guess was made, we remember, at the time as to their\r\nprobable value; but high as the estimates generally were, they came far\r\nshort of the truth. We give the cash and credit returns of advertisements\r\nof all kinds for nine weeks:--\r\n\r\n  Sept. 6      £2839 14 0\r\n    \"  13       3783 12 0\r\n    \"  20       3935  7 6\r\n    \"  27       4692  7 0\r\n  Oct.  4       6318 14 0\r\n    \"  11       6543 17 0\r\n    \"  18       6687  4 0\r\n    \"  25       6025 14 6\r\n  Nov.  1       3230  3 6\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the time that the proprietors were reaping this\r\nsplendid harvest from the infatuation of the people, the heaviest guns\r\nwere daily brought to bear from the leading columns upon the bubbles which\r\nrose up so thickly in the advertising sheet. The effect of their fire may\r\nbe measured by the falling off of nearly 3,000_l._ in the returns for a\r\nsingle week. A journal which could afford to sacrifice such a revenue to\r\nits independence, certainly deserved some consideration from the\r\nGovernment; but, on the contrary, it appears to have been singled out for\r\nannoyance by the act which relates to newspapers. We see certain trees on\r\nour lawns whose upshooting branches are by ingenious gardeners trained\r\ndownwards, and taught to hold themselves in a dependent condition by the\r\nimposition of weights upon their extremities. The state gardeners have\r\napplied the same treatment to the journal in question, by hanging an extra\r\nhalfpenny stamp upon every copy of its issue--a proceeding which, in our\r\nopinion, is as unfair as it is injudicious: and this they will find in the\r\nfuture, when the crowd of mosquito-like cheap journals called forth by the\r\nmeasure, and supported by the very life-blood of the leading journal,\r\nbegin to gather strength and to attack Whiggery with their democratic\r\nbuzz.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt chiefly upon the advertising sheet of the _Times_, because\r\nit is the epitome of that in all the other journals. It must be mentioned,\r\nhowever, that some of the morning and weekly papers lay themselves out\r\nfor class advertisements. Thus the _Morning Post_ monopolizes all those\r\nwhich relate to fashion and high life; and the _Morning Advertiser_, the\r\npaper of the licensed victuallers, aggregates to itself every announcement\r\nrelating to their craft. _Bell's Life_ is one mass of advertisements of\r\nvarious sports; the _Era_ is great upon all theatricals; the _Athenæum_\r\ngathers to itself a large proportion of book advertisements. The\r\n_Illustrated News_ among the weeklies, like the _Times_ among the dailies,\r\ntowers by the head above them all. A hebdomadal circulation of 170,000\r\ndraws a far more cosmopolitan collection of announcements to its pages\r\nthan any of its contemporaries can boast. We have said nothing of the\r\nadvertisements in the provincial journals; but it is gratifying to find\r\nthat they have more than kept pace with those which have appeared in the\r\nmetropolitan papers. Their enormous increase is best shown by the returns\r\nof the advertisement duty; from which it appears that in 1851 no less than\r\n2,334,593 advertisements were published in the journals of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland--a number which has vastly augmented since the tax upon them\r\nhas been repealed.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see the estimate which the different journals place upon\r\nthemselves as mediums of publicity, by comparing their charges for the\r\nsame advertisement. Thus the contents of the _Quarterly Review_ for\r\nJanuary, 1855, precisely similar as far as length is concerned, was\r\ncharged for insertion as an advertisement by the different papers as\r\nfollows:--_Times_, 4s.; _Illustrated News_, 1_l._ 8s.; _Morning\r\nChronicle_, 5s. 6d.; _Morning Post_, 6s.; _Daily News_, 5s. 6d.;\r\n_Spectator_, 7s. 6d.; _Morning Herald_, 6s.; _Punch_, 15s.; _Observer_,\r\n9s. 6d.; _English Churchman_, 5s. 6d.; _Examiner_, 3s. 6d.; _John Bull_,\r\n5s. 6d.; _Athenæum_, 10s. 6d. Now the _Times_ did not \"display\" the\r\nadvertisement as all the others did, it is true, and therefore squeezed it\r\ninto half the space; but with this difference, its charge was absolutely\r\nthe lowest in the list, with the single exception of that of the\r\n_Examiner_. How this moderation on the part of the Leading Journal is to\r\nbe accounted for we know not; but the apparent dearness of the\r\n_Illustrated News_ meets a ready solution, and affords us an opportunity\r\nof showing how vastly the prime cost of an advertisement, during the\r\npresent high price of paper especially, is augmented by a great increase\r\nof the circulation of the paper in which it appears, and what the\r\nadvertiser really gets for his money. If we take the advertisement of our\r\ncontents (_Quarterly Review_), it will be found to measure about one inch\r\nin depth; it is obvious, then, that we must multiply this measure by\r\n170,000, the number of separate copies in which it appeared. Now 170,000\r\ninches yield a strip of printed paper the width of a newspaper\r\ncolumn--_upwards of two miles and three-quarters long!_ Thus we have at a\r\nglance the real amount of publicity which is procurable in a great\r\njournal; and with so remarkable a statement it will be well to close our\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD AND ITS ADULTERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA story is told of a European who, wishing to convince a Brahmin of the\r\nfolly of his faith in interdicting, as an article of food, anything that\r\nonce possessed life, showed him, by the aid of the microscope, that the\r\nvery water which he drank was full of living things. The Indian, thus\r\nsuddenly introduced to an unseen world, dashed the instrument to the\r\nground, and reproached his teacher for having so wantonly destroyed the\r\nguiding principle of his life. We, too, have at home a Hindoo, in the\r\nshape of the believing British public, to whose eye Dr. Hassall nicely\r\nadjusts the focus of his microscope, and bids him behold what unseen\r\nvillanies are daily perpetrated upon his purse and person.\r\n\r\nThe world at large has almost forgotten Accum's celebrated work, \"Death in\r\nthe Pot;\" a new generation has indeed sprung up since it was written, and\r\nfraudulent tradesmen and manufacturers have gone on in silence, and, up to\r\nthis time, in security, falsifying the food and picking the pockets of the\r\npeople. Startling indeed as were the revelations in that remarkable book,\r\nyet it had little effect in reforming the abuses it exposed. General\r\ndenunciations of grocers did not touch individuals of the craft, and they\r\nwere consequently not driven to improve the quality of their wares. The\r\n_Lancet_ Commission went to work in a different manner. In Turkey, when of\r\nold they caught a baker giving false weight, or adulterating the staff of\r\nlife, they nailed his ear to the door-post, \"pour encourager les autres.\"\r\nDr. Hassall, like a modern Al Raschid, perambulated the town himself, or\r\nsent his trustworthy agents to purchase articles, upon all of which the\r\ninexorable microscope was set to work, and every fraudulent sample, after\r\ndue notice given, subjected its vendor to be pinned for ever to the\r\nterrible pages of the Commissioners' report. In this manner direct\r\nresponsibility was obtained. If the falsification denounced was not the\r\nwork of the retailer, he was glad enough to shift the blame upon the\r\nmanufacturer; and thus the truth came out.\r\n\r\nA gun suddenly fired into a rookery could not cause a greater commotion\r\nthan this publication of the names of dishonest tradesmen; nor does the\r\ndaylight, when you lift a stone, startle ugly and loathsome things more\r\nquickly than the pencil of light, streaming through a quarter-inch lens,\r\nsurprised in their naked ugliness the thousand and one illegal substances\r\nwhich enter more or less into every description of food that it will pay\r\nto adulterate. Nay, to such a pitch of refinement has the art of\r\nfalsification of alimentary substances reached, that the very articles\r\nused to adulterate are adulterated; and while one tradesman is picking the\r\npockets of his customers, a still more cunning rogue is, unknown to\r\nhimself, deep in his own!\r\n\r\nThe manner in which food is adulterated is not only one of degree, but of\r\nkind. The most simple of all sophistications, and that which is most\r\nharmless, is the mixture of inferior qualities of the same substance.\r\nIndeed, if the price charged were according to quality, it would be no\r\nfraud at all; but this adjustment rarely takes place. Secondly, the\r\nmixture of cheaper articles of another kind. Thirdly, the surreptitious\r\nintroduction of materials which, taken in large quantities, are\r\nprejudicial to health; and, fourthly, the admixture of the most deadly\r\npoisons in order to improve the appearance of the article \"doctored.\"\r\n\r\nThe microscope alone is capable of detecting at one operation the nature\r\nand extent of the more harmless but general of these frauds. When once the\r\ninvestigator, by the aid of that instrument, has become familiar with the\r\nconfigurations of different kinds of the same chemically composed\r\nsubstances, he is armed with far greater detective power than chemical\r\nagents could provide him with. It is beyond the limit of the test-tube to\r\nshow the mind the various forms of animal and vegetable life which exist\r\nin impure water; delicate as are its powers, it could not indicate the\r\npresence of the sugar-insect, or distinguish with unerring nicety an\r\nadmixture of the common Circuma arrowroot with the finer Maranta.\r\nChemistry is quite capable of telling the component parts of any article:\r\nwhat are the definite forms and natures of the various ingredients which\r\nenter into a mixture, it cannot so easily answer. This the microscope can\r\nat once effect; and in its present application consists Dr. Hassall's\r\nadvantage over all previous investigators in the same field. The precision\r\nwith which he is enabled to state the result of his labours leaves no\r\nappeal: he shows his reader the intimate structures of a coffee-grain, and\r\nof oak or mahogany sawdust; and then a specimen of the two combined, sold\r\nunder the title of genuine Mocha. Many manufacturers and retailers who\r\nhave been detected falsifying the food of the public, have threatened\r\nactions; but they all flinched from the test of this unerring instrument.\r\n\r\nThe system of adulteration is so wide-spread, and embraces so many of the\r\nitems of the daily meal, that we scarcely know where to begin--what corner\r\nof the veil first to lift. Let us hold up the cruet-frame, for example,\r\nand analyze its contents. There is mustard, pepper (black and cayenne),\r\nvinegar, anchovy and Harvey sauce--so thinks the unsuspecting reader; let\r\nus show him what else beside. To begin with mustard. \"Best Durham,\" or\r\n\"Superfine Durham,\" no doubt it was purchased for; but we will summarily\r\ndismiss this substance by stating that it is impossible to procure it pure\r\nat all: out of forty-two samples bought by Dr. Hassall at the best as well\r\nas inferior shops, all were more or less adulterated with wheaten flour\r\nfor bulk, and with turmeric for colour. Vinegar also suffers a double\r\nadulteration. It is first watered, and then pungency is given to it by the\r\naddition of sulphuric acid. A small quantity of this acid is allowed by\r\nlaw; and this is frequently trebled by the victuallers. The pepper-castor\r\nis another stronghold of fraud--fraud so long and openly practised, that\r\nwe question if the great mass of the perpetrators even think they are\r\ndoing wrong. Among the milder forms of sophistication to which this\r\narticle is subjected, are to be found such ingredients as wheaten flour,\r\nground rice, ground mustard-seeds, and linseed-meal. The grocer maintains\r\na certain reserve as to the generality of the articles he employs in\r\nvitiating his wares; but pepper he seems to think is given up to him by\r\nthe public to \"cook\" in any manner he thinks fit. This he almost\r\ninvariably does by the addition of what is known in the trade as P. D., or\r\npepper-dust, _alias_ the sweepings from the pepper warehouses. But there\r\nis a lower depth still: P. D. is too genuine a commodity for some markets,\r\nand it is accordingly mixed with D. P. D., or dirt of pepper-dust.\r\n\r\nA little book, published not long since, entitled \"The Successful\r\nMerchant,\" which gives the minute trade history of a gentleman very much\r\nrespected in Bristol, Samuel Budgett, Esq., affords us a passage bearing\r\nupon this P. D. which is worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n    \"In Mr. Budgett's early days,\" says his biographer, \"pepper was under\r\n    a heavy tax, and in the trade universal tradition said that out of the\r\n    trade everybody expected pepper to be mixed. In the shop stood a cask\r\n    labelled P. D., containing something _very like_ pepper-dust,\r\n    wherewith it was usual to mix the pepper before sending it forth to\r\n    serve the public. The trade tradition had obtained for the apocryphal\r\n    P. D. a place amongst the standard articles of the shop, and on the\r\n    strength of that tradition it was vended for pepper by men who thought\r\n    they were honest. But as Samuel went on in life, his ideas on trade\r\n    morality grew clearer; this P. D. began to give him much discomfort.\r\n    He thought upon it till he was satisfied that, after all that could be\r\n    said, the thing was wrong: arrived at this conclusion, he felt that no\r\n    blessing could light upon the place while it was there. He instantly\r\n    decreed that P. D. should perish. It was night; but back he went to\r\n    the shop, took the hypocritical cask, carried it out to the quarry,\r\n    then staved it, and scattered P. D. among the clods and slag and\r\n    stones.\"\r\n\r\nWould we could say that the reduction of the tax upon pepper had\r\nstimulated the honesty of other grocers to act a similar part to that of\r\nMr. Budgett; but P. D. flourishes as flagrantly as ever; and if every\r\npossessor of the article in London were to stave his casks in the roadway,\r\nas conscientiously as did the \"Successful Merchant,\" there would be hard\r\nwork for the scavengers. In the days of Accum it was usual to manufacture\r\npeppercorns out of oiled linseed-cake, clay, and cayenne-pepper, formed\r\ninto a mass, and then granulated: these fraudulent corns were mixed with\r\nthe real to the extent of seventeen per cent. This form of imposition,\r\nlike that of wooden nutmegs among our American friends, has, we are happy\r\nto say, long been abandoned. The adulterations we have mentioned are\r\nsimply dirty and fraudulent; but in the cayenne-cruet we find, in\r\naddition, a deadly poison. Out of twenty-eight samples submitted to\r\nexamination, no less than twenty-four were adulterated with white\r\nmustard-seed, brickdust, salt, ground rice, and _deal sawdust_, by way of\r\ngiving bulk; but as all of these tend to lighten the colour, it is\r\nnecessary to heighten it to the required pitch. And what is employed to do\r\nthis? Hear and tremble, old Indians and lovers of high-seasoned food--with\r\nRED LEAD. Out of twenty-eight samples, red lead, and _often in poisonous\r\nquantities_, was present in thirteen! Who knows how many \"yellow admirals\"\r\nat Bath have fallen victims to their cayenne-cruets? Nor can it be said\r\nthat the small quantity taken at a time could do no permanent mischief;\r\nfor lead belongs to the class of poisons which are cumulative in their\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nHe who loves cayenne, as a rule is fond of curry-powder; and here also the\r\npoisonous oxide is to be found in large quantities. Some years ago, a\r\ncertain amiable duke recommended the labouring population, during a season\r\nof famine, to take a pinch of this condiment every morning before going to\r\nwork, as \"warm and comforting to the stomach.\" If they had followed his\r\nadvice, thirteen out of every twenty-eight persons would have imbibed a\r\nslow poison. Those who are in the habit of using curry, generally take it\r\nin considerable quantities, and thus the villanous falsification plays a\r\nmore deadly part than even in cayenne-pepper. Imagine a man for years\r\npertinaciously painting his stomach with red lead! We do not know whether\r\nmedical statistics prove that paralysis prevails much among \"Nabobs;\" but\r\nof this we may be sure, that there could be no more fruitful source of it\r\nthan the two favourite stimulants we have named.\r\n\r\nThe great staple articles of food are not subject to adulteration in the\r\nsame proportion as many other articles of minor demand. We need scarcely\r\nsay that meat is exempt so long as it remains in the condition of joints;\r\nbut immediately it is prepared in any shape in which its original fibre\r\nand form can be hidden, the spirit of craft begins to work. The public\r\nhave always had certain prejudices against sausages and polonies, for\r\nexample; and, if we are to believe a witness examined on oath before the\r\nSmithfield Market Commissioners in 1850, not without reason. It is a very\r\nold joke that there are no live donkeys to be found within twenty miles of\r\nEpping; but if all the asinine tribe in England were to fall victims to\r\nthe chopping-machine, we question if they could supply the _à-la-mode_,\r\npolony, and sausage establishments. Mr. J. Harper, for instance, being\r\nunder examination, upon being asked what became of the diseased meat\r\nbrought into London, replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is purchased by the soup-shops, sausage-makers, the _à-la-mode_\r\n    beef and meat-pie shops, &c. There is one soup-shop, I believe, doing\r\n    five hundred pounds per week in diseased meat. This firm has a large\r\n    _foreign_ trade [thank goodness!]. The trade in diseased meat is very\r\n    alarming, as anything in the shape of flesh can be sold at about one\r\n    penny per pound, or eightpence per stone.... I am certain that if one\r\n    hundred carcases of cows were lying dead in the neighbourhood of\r\n    London, I could get them all sold within twenty-four hours: _it don't\r\n    matter what they died of_.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that the _à-la-mode_ beef interest is supplied\r\nwith this carrion by needy men, whose necessities may in some degree\r\npalliate their evil dealings. In proof of this we quote further from Mr.\r\nHarper's evidence. In answer to the question, \"Is there any slaughtering\r\nof bad meat in the country for the supply of the London market?\" he\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n    \"The London market is very extensively supplied with diseased meat\r\n    from the country. There are three insurance offices in London in which\r\n    graziers can insure their beasts from disease. It was the practice of\r\n    one of these offices to send the unsound animals dying from disease to\r\n    their own slaughter-houses, situate a hundred and sixty miles from\r\n    London, to be dressed and sent to the London market.... Cattle, sheep,\r\n    &c., are insured against all kinds of diseases; and one of the\r\n    conditions is, that the diseased animal, when dead, becomes the\r\n    property of the insurance company, the party insuring receiving\r\n    two-thirds of the value of the animal and one-third of the salvage;\r\n    or, in other words, one-third of the amount the beast is sold for when\r\n    dead.\"\r\n\r\nUpon being asked, \"Do you believe it is still the habit of this company to\r\nsend up the diseased animals to London?\" he replied,--\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, I do; until lately they were regularly consigned to a\r\n    meat-salesman in Newgate market of the name of Mathews.... The larger\r\n    quantities are sold to people who manufacture it into soup, meat-pies,\r\n    sausages, &c.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no wish to destroy the generally robust appetite of the persons\r\nwho visit such shops by any gratuitous disclosure; but we question whether\r\nthe most hungry crossing-sweeper would look any more with a longing eye\r\nupon the huge German sausages, rich and inviting as they appear, if, like\r\nMr. Harper, he knew the too probable antecedents of their contents. The\r\nonly other preparations of flesh open to adulteration are preserved meats.\r\nSome years ago, \"the Goldner canister business\" so excited the public\r\nagainst this invaluable method of storing perishing articles of food, that\r\na prejudice has existed against it ever since; and a more senseless\r\nprejudice could not be. Goldner's process, since adopted by Messrs. Cooper\r\nand Aves, is simple and beautiful. The provisions, being placed in tin\r\ncanisters having their covers soldered down, are plunged up to their necks\r\nin a bath of chloride of calcium (a preparation which imbibes a great heat\r\nwithout boiling), and their contents are speedily cooked; at the same time\r\nall the air in the meat, and some of the water, are expelled in the form\r\nof steam, which issues from a pin-hole in the lid. The instant the cook\r\nascertains the process to be complete, he drops a plug of solder upon the\r\nhole, and the mass is thus hermetically sealed. Exclusion of air, and\r\ncoagulation of the albumen, are the two conditions which enable us to hand\r\nthe most delicate-flavoured meats down to remote generations,--for as\r\nlong, in fact, as a stout painted tin canister can maintain itself intact\r\nagainst the oxidating effect of the atmosphere. We have ourselves partaken\r\nlately of a duck that was winged, and of milk that came from the cow, as\r\nlong as eight years ago. Fruit which had been gathered whilst the\r\nfree-trade struggle was still going on, we found as delicate in flavour as\r\nthough it had just been plucked from the branch. Out of the many cases of\r\nall kinds of provisions opened and examined by Dr. Hassall, scarcely any\r\nhave been found to be bad. When we remember that the graves of so many of\r\nour soldiers in the Crimea may be justly inscribed, \"Died of salt pork,\"\r\nwe cannot forbear to call attention to a neglected means of feeding our\r\ntroops with good and nutritious food, instead of with the tough fibre\r\ncalled meat, from which half the blood-making qualities have been\r\nextracted by the process of boiling, whilst the remaining half is rendered\r\nindigestible by the action of salt, and poisonous by the extraction of one\r\nof its most important constituents. It would seem as if we were living in\r\nthe days of Anson, who lost 626 men of scurvy, out of a crew of 961,\r\nbefore he could reach the island of Juan Fernandez, or of the still later\r\ncruise of Sir C. Hardy, who sent 3,500 to hospital with this fatal\r\ndisease, after a six weeks' sail with the Channel fleet. It may be urged\r\nthat the sailors in the late war did not sicken on salt pork; but while\r\nthey had the necessary amount of potass, which the stomach requires to\r\nmake blood, in the lime-juice served out to them, our troops were without\r\nthis indispensable accompaniment, and consequently died. In the preserved\r\nmeats, which are made up with potatoes and other vegetables, the needful\r\npotass exists, and such food may be purchased as cheaply as the pernicious\r\nsalt junk which is patronized by the Government.\r\n\r\nBread, the great blood-producer, claims particular attention. It often\r\nsurprises persons who walk about the metropolis to find that prices vary\r\naccording to the locality; thus the loaf that costs in the Borough or the\r\nNew Cut 7_d._ a quartern, is 10-1/2_d._ at the West End. Can plate-glass\r\nwindows and rent cause all this difference? Certainly not. We are glad,\r\nhowever, to find that many of the adulterations mentioned by our older\r\nwriters have vanished with free trade. Prince and Accum mention plaster of\r\nParis, bone-dust, the meal of other cereal grains, white clay, alum,\r\nsulphate of copper, potatoes, &c. All of these sophistications have\r\ndisappeared, with the exception of potatoes, which are occasionally\r\nemployed when the difference between their value and that of flour makes\r\nit worth while for the baker or miller to introduce them. When we see a\r\nloaf marked under the market price, we may rest assured that it is made of\r\nflour ground from inferior and damaged wheat. In order to bring this up to\r\nthe required colour, and to destroy the sour taste which often belongs to\r\nit, bakers are in the habit of introducing a mixture called in the trade\r\n\"hards\" and \"stuff,\" which is nothing more than alum and salt, kept\r\nprepared in large quantities by the druggists. The quantity of alum\r\nnecessary to render bread white is certainly not great--Mitchell found\r\nthat it ranged from 116 grains to 34-1/2 grains in the four-pound loaf;\r\nbut the great advantage the baker derives from it, in addition to\r\nimproving the colour of his wares, is, that it absorbs a large quantity of\r\nwater, which he sells at the present time at the rate of 2_d._ a pound.\r\nOut of twenty-eight loaves of bread bought in every quarter of the\r\nmetropolis, Dr. Hassall did not find one free from the adulteration of\r\nalum; and in some of the samples he found considerable quantities. As a\r\ngeneral rule, the lower the neighbourhood, the cheaper the bread, and the\r\ngreater the quantity of this \"hards\" or \"stuff\" introduced. We must not,\r\nhowever, lay all the blame upon the baker. This was satisfactorily shown\r\nby the Sanitary Commissioners, when dealing with the bread sold by the\r\nLeague Bread Company, whose advertisement to the following effect is\r\nconstantly to be seen in the _Times_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The object for which the above company was established, and is now in\r\n    operation, is to insure to the public bread of a pure and nutritious\r\n    character. Experience daily proves how much our health is dependent\r\n    upon the quality and purity of our food; consequently, how important\r\n    it is that an article of such universal consumption as bread should be\r\n    free from adulteration. That various diseases are caused by the use of\r\n    _alum_ and other deleterious ingredients in the manufacture of bread,\r\n    the testimony of many eminent men will fully corroborate. Pure\r\n    unadulterated bread, full weight, best quality, and the lowest\r\n    possible price.\"\r\n\r\nUpon several samples of this _pure bread_, purchased of various agents of\r\nthe company, being tested, they were found to be contaminated with _alum_!\r\nHere was a discovery. The company protested that the analyses were\r\nworthless; and all their workmen made a solemn declaration that they had\r\nnever used any alum whilst in their employ. The agents of the company\r\nalso declared that they never sold any but their bread. The analyst looked\r\nagain through his microscope, and again reiterated his charge, that alum\r\ntheir bread contained. It was then agreed to test the flour supplied to\r\nthe company, and three samples were proved to contain the obnoxious\r\nmaterial. Thus we find that the miller still, in some instances, maintains\r\nhis doubtful reputation, and is at the bottom of this roguery.\r\n\r\nOur succeeding remarks will fall, we fear, like a bomb upon many a\r\ntea-table, and stagger teetotalism in its stronghold. A drunkard's stomach\r\nis sometimes exhibited at total-abstinence lectures, in every stage of\r\ncongestion and inflammation, painted up to match the fervid eloquence of\r\nthe lecturer. If tea is our only refuge from the frightful maladies\r\nentailed upon us by fermented liquors, we fear the British public is in a\r\nperplexing dilemma. Ladies, there is death in the teapot! Green-tea\r\ndrinkers, beware! There has always been a vague idea afloat in the public\r\nmind about hot copper plates--a suspicion that gunpowder and hyson do not\r\ncome by their colour honestly. The old duchess of Marlborough used to\r\nboast that she came into the world before \"nerves were in fashion.\" We\r\nfeel half inclined to believe this joke had a great truth in it; for since\r\nthe introduction of tea, nervous complaints of all kinds have greatly\r\nincreased; and we need not look far to find one at least of the causes in\r\nthe teapot. There is no such a thing as pure green tea to be met with in\r\nEngland. It is adulterated in China; and we have lately learnt to\r\nadulterate it at home almost as well as the cunning Asiatic. The pure\r\ngreen tea made from the most delicate green leaves grown upon manured\r\nsoil, such as the Chinese use themselves, is, it is true, wholly\r\nuntainted; and we are informed that its beautiful bluish bloom, like that\r\nupon a grape, is given by the third process of roasting which it\r\nundergoes. The enormous demand for a moderately-priced green tea which has\r\narisen both in England and China since the opening of the trade, has led\r\nthe Hong merchants to imitate this peculiar colour; and this they do so\r\nsuccessfully as to deceive the ordinary judges of the article. Black tea\r\nis openly coloured in the neighbourhood of Canton in the most wholesale\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Fortune, in his very interesting work, \"The Tea Districts of\r\nChina and India,\" gives us a good description of the manner in which this\r\ncolouring process is performed, as witnessed by himself:--\r\n\r\n    \"Having procured a portion of Prussian-blue, he threw it into a\r\n    porcelain bowl, not unlike a chemist's mortar, and crushed it into a\r\n    very fine powder. At the same time a quantity of gypsum was produced\r\n    and burned in the charcoal fires which were then roasting the teas.\r\n    The object of this was to soften it, in order that it might be readily\r\n    pounded into a very fine powder, in the same manner as the\r\n    Prussian-blue had been. The gypsum, having been taken out of the fire\r\n    after a certain time had elapsed, readily crumbled down, and was\r\n    reduced to powder in the mortar. These two substances, having been\r\n    thus prepared, were then mixed together in the proportion of four\r\n    parts of gypsum to three parts of Prussian-blue, and formed a light\r\n    blue powder, which was then ready for use.\r\n\r\n    \"This colouring matter was applied to the teas during the process of\r\n    roasting. About five minutes before the tea was removed from the\r\n    pans--the time being regulated by the burning of a joss-stick--the\r\n    superintendent took a small porcelain spoon, and with it he scattered\r\n    a portion of the colouring matter over the leaves in each pan. The\r\n    workmen then turned the leaves round rapidly with both hands, in order\r\n    that the colour might be equally diffused. During this part of the\r\n    operation the hands of the workmen were quite blue. I could not help\r\n    thinking, if any green-tea drinkers had been present during the\r\n    operation, their taste would have been corrected, and, I believe,\r\n    improved.\r\n\r\n    \"One day an English gentleman in Shanghae, being in conversation with\r\n    some Chinese from the green-tea country, asked them what reason they\r\n    had for dyeing the tea, and whether it would not be better without\r\n    undergoing this process. They acknowledged that tea was much better\r\n    when prepared without having any such ingredients mixed with it, and\r\n    that _they never drank dyed teas_ themselves, but justly remarked,\r\n    that, as foreigners seemed _to prefer having a mixture of\r\n    Prussian-blue and gypsum with their tea_ to make it look uniform and\r\n    pretty, and as these ingredients were cheap enough, the Chinese had no\r\n    objection to supply them, especially as such teas always fetched a\r\n    higher price.\r\n\r\n    \"I took some trouble to ascertain precisely the quantity of colouring\r\n    matter used in the process of dyeing green teas, not certainly with\r\n    the view of assisting others, either at home or abroad, in the art of\r\n    colouring, but simply to show green-tea drinkers in England, and more\r\n    particularly in the United States of America, what _quantity_ of\r\n    Prussian-blue and gypsum they imbibe in the course of one year. To\r\n    14-1/2 lbs. were applied 8 mace 2-1/2 candareens of colouring matter,\r\n    or rather more than an ounce. To every hundred pounds of coloured\r\n    green-tea consumed in England or America, the consumer actually drinks\r\n    more than half a pound of Prussian-blue and gypsum. And yet, tell the\r\n    drinkers of this coloured tea that the Chinese eat cats and dogs, and\r\n    they will hold up their hands in amazement, and pity the poor\r\n    Celestials.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Chinese use it in these quantities to tinge the genuine leaf, how\r\nmuch more must the English employ in making up afresh exhausted leaves!\r\nThat every spoonful of hyson or gunpowder contains a considerable quantity\r\nof this deleterious dye will be seen by any one who places a pinch upon a\r\nfine sieve, and pours upon it a gentle stream of water, when the tinging\r\nof the liquid will show at once the extent of the adulteration, and the\r\nfolly of drinking painted tea. Assam tea, though not so inviting in\r\ncolour, is free from adulteration. A word to the wise is enough.\r\n\r\nOf fifty samples of green tea analyzed by Dr. Hassall, all were\r\nadulterated. There is one particular kind which is almost entirely a\r\nmanufactured article--gunpowder, both black and green--the former being\r\ncalled scented caper. Both have a large admixture of what is termed \"lye\r\ntea,\" or a compound of sand, dirt, tea-dust, and broken-down portions of\r\nother leaves worked together with gum into small nodules. This detestable\r\ncompound, which, according to Mr. Warrington,[3] who has analyzed it,\r\ncontains forty-five per cent. of earthy matter, is manufactured both in\r\nChina and in England, for the express purpose of adulterating tea. When\r\nmixed with \"scented caper,\" it is \"faced\" with black lead; when with\r\ngunpowder, Prussian-blue: turmeric and French chalk give it the required\r\nbloom. Mr. Warrington states that about 750,000 lbs. of this spurious tea\r\nhave been imported into Great Britain within eighteen months! Singularly\r\nenough, the low-priced teas are the only genuine ones. Every sample of\r\nthis class which was analyzed by Dr. Hassall proved to be perfectly pure.\r\nHere at least the poor have the advantage of the better classes, who pay a\r\nhigher price to be injured in their health by a painted beverage.\r\n\r\nThe practice of redrying used-up leaves is also carried on to some extent\r\nin England. Mr. George Philips, of the Inland Revenue Office, states that\r\nin 1843 there were no less than eight manufactories for the purpose of\r\nredrying tea-leaves in London alone, whilst there were many others in\r\ndifferent parts of the country. These manufacturers had agents who bought\r\nup the used leaves from hotels, clubs, coffeehouses, &c., for twopence\r\nhalfpenny and threepence per lb. With these leaves, others of various\r\ntrees were used, and very fine pekoe still flourishes upon the\r\nhawthorn-bushes, sloe-trees, &c., around the metropolis. As late as the\r\nyear 1851 the following account of the proceedings of one of these\r\nnefarious manufacturers appeared in the _Times_:--\r\n\r\n    \"CLERKENWELL.--Edward South and Louisa his wife were placed at the\r\n    bar, before Mr. Combe, charged by Inspector Brennan, of the E\r\n    division, with being concerned in the manufacture of spurious tea. It\r\n    appeared, from the statement of the inspector, that, in consequence of\r\n    information that the prisoners and others were in the habit of\r\n    carrying on an extensive traffic in manufacturing spurious tea, on the\r\n    premises situate at 27-1/2, Clerkenwell Close, Clerkenwell Green, on\r\n    Saturday evening, at about seven o'clock, the witness, in company with\r\n    Serjeant Cole, proceeded to the house, where they found the prisoners\r\n    in an apartment busily engaged in the manufacture of spurious tea.\r\n    There was an extensive furnace, before which was suspended an iron\r\n    pan, containing sloe-leaves and tea-leaves, which they were in the\r\n    practice of purchasing from coffeeshop-keepers after being used. On\r\n    searching the place they found an immense quantity of used tea,\r\n    bay-leaves, and every description of spurious ingredients for the\r\n    purpose of manufacturing illicit tea, and they were mixed with a\r\n    solution of gum and a quantity of _copperas_. The woman was employed\r\n    in stirring about the bay-leaves and other composition with the\r\n    solution of gum in the pan; and in one part of the room there was a\r\n    large quantity of spurious stuffs, the exact imitation of genuine tea.\r\n    In a back room they found nearly a hundred pounds weight of redried\r\n    tea-leaves, bay-leaves, and sloe-leaves, all spread on the floor\r\n    drying.... Mr. Brennan added, that the prisoners had pursued this\r\n    nefarious traffic most extensively, and were in the habit of dealing\r\n    largely with grocers, chandlers, and others in the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis poisonous imitation green tea, \"so largely supplied to country\r\ngrocers,\" was no doubt used for adulterating other green teas already\r\ndosed with Prussian-blue, turmeric, &c. These have found their way into\r\nmany a country home of small means. When the nephew comes on a visit, or\r\nthe curate calls of an afternoon, the ordinary two spoonfuls of black are\r\n\"improved\" with \"just a dash of green,\" and the poor innocent gentleman\r\nwonders afterwards what it can be that keeps him awake all night.\r\n\r\nWe often hear the remark from old-fashioned people that we have never had\r\nany good tea since the monopoly of the East-India Company was broken up:\r\nin this remark there is some truth and much error. There can be no\r\npossible doubt that the higher-priced teas have fallen off since the trade\r\nhas been open, as the buyers of the company were perfectly aware of the\r\nfrauds perpetrated by the Hong merchants, and never allowed a spurious\r\narticle to be shipped. On the other hand, the great reduction which has\r\ntaken place in the price of the common black teas, both on account of the\r\ncessation of monopoly and the reduction of the duty, has in a great\r\nmeasure destroyed the English manufacture of spurious tea from indigenous\r\nleaves. The extent to which this formerly took place may be judged from a\r\nreport of the Committee of the House of Commons, in 1783, which states\r\nthat no less than four millions of pounds were annually manufactured from\r\nsloe and ash leaves in different parts of England; and this, be it\r\nremembered, when the whole quantity of genuine tea sold by the East-India\r\nCompany did not amount to more than six millions of pounds annually.\r\n\r\nIf the better class of black and all green teas[4] are thus vilely\r\nadulterated, the reader may fancy he can at least take refuge in\r\ncoffee--alas! in too many cases he will only avoid Scylla to fall into\r\nCharybdis. Coffee, as generally sold in the metropolis and in all large\r\ntowns, is adulterated even more than tea. The Treasury minute, which\r\nallowed it to be mixed with chicory, is at the head and front of the\r\noffending. In the year 1840, this celebrated minute was issued by the\r\nsanction of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir C. Wood, the\r\nimmediate consequence of which was that grocers began to mix it with pure\r\ncoffee in very large quantities, quite forgetting to inform the public of\r\nthe nature of the mixture, and neglecting at the same time to lower the\r\nprice. The evil became so flagrant that upon the installation of the Derby\r\nadministration Mr. Disraeli promised to rescind this license to\r\nadulterate; but before the promise was redeemed, the administration was\r\nrescinded itself. Mr. Gladstone, upon his acceptance of office, loath, it\r\nappears, to injure the chicory interest, modified the original minute, but\r\nallowed the amalgamation to continue, provided the package was labelled\r\n\"Mixture of Chicory and Coffee.\" It was speedily found, however, that this\r\nannouncement became so confounded with other printing on the label that it\r\nwas not easily distinguishable, and in consequence it was provided that\r\nthe words, \"This is sold as a mixture of Chicory and Coffee,\" should be\r\nprinted by themselves on one side of the canister. It may be asked what is\r\nthe nature of this ingredient, that the right to mix it with coffee should\r\nbe maintained by two Chancellors of the Exchequer, during a period of\r\nfifteen years, as jealously as though it were some important principle of\r\nour constitution? Chicory, to say the best of it, is an insipid root,\r\ntotally destitute of any nourishing or refreshing quality, being utterly\r\ndeficient in any nitrogenized principle, whilst there are strong doubts\r\nwhether it is not absolutely hurtful to the nervous system. Professor\r\nBeer, the celebrated oculist of Vienna, forbids the use of it to his\r\npatients, considering it to be the cause of amaurotic blindness. Even\r\nsupposing it to be perfectly harmless, we have a material of the value of\r\n8_d._ a pound, which the grocer is allowed to mix, _ad libitum_, with one\r\nworth 1_s._ 4_d._ If the poor got the benefit of the adulteration, there\r\nmight be some excuse for permitting the admixture of chicory, but it is\r\nproved that the combination is sold in many shops at the same price as\r\npure coffee.\r\n\r\nAnalyses made by Dr. Hassall of upwards of a hundred different samples of\r\ncoffee, purchased in all parts of the metropolis before the issuing of the\r\norder for the labelling of the packages 'chicory and coffee,' proved that,\r\nin a great number of cases, articles sold as \"finest Mocha,\" \"choice\r\nJamaica coffee,\" \"superb coffee,\" &c., contained, in some instances, very\r\nlittle coffee at all; in others \"only a fifth, a third, half,\" &c., the\r\nrest being made up mainly of chicory. Nothing is more indicative of the\r\nbarefaced frauds perpetrated by grocers upon the public than the manner in\r\nwhich they go out of their way to puff in the grossest style the most\r\nabominable trash. The report of the sanitary commission gives many\r\nexamples of these puff and announcements, which, we are informed, are kept\r\nset up at the printers, and may be had in any quantities. We quote one as\r\nan example:--\r\n\r\n    \"JOHN ----'S COFFEE,\r\n\r\n    \"_The richness, flavour, and strength of which are not to be\r\n    surpassed._\r\n\r\n    \"Coffee has now become an article of consumption among all classes of\r\n    the community. Hence the importance of supplying an article of such a\r\n    character as to encourage its consumption in preference to beverages\r\n    the use of which promotes a vast amount of misery.\r\n\r\n    \"John ----'s coffee meets the requirement of the age, and, as a\r\n    natural result, the celebrity to which it has attained is wholly\r\n    unparalleled. Its peculiarity consists in its possessing that rich\r\n    aromatic flavour, combined with great strength and deliciousness,\r\n    which is to be found alone in the choicest mountain growths. It may,\r\n    with perfect truth, be stated that no article connected with _domestic\r\n    economy_ has given such general satisfaction, and the demand for it is\r\n    rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\n    \"John ----'s establishment, both for extent and capability, is the\r\n    first in the empire.\r\n\r\n    \"Observe!\r\n\r\n    \"Every canister of John ----'s coffee bears his signature, without\r\n    which none is _genuine_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of this puff the analyst places the words--\r\n\r\n    \"_Adulterated with a considerable quantity of chicory!_\"\r\n\r\nMore erudite grocers treat us to the puff literary, as in the following\r\ninstance:--\r\n\r\n    \"Rich-flavoured coffees fresh-roasted daily.\r\n\r\n    \"USE OF COFFEE IN TURKEY.\r\n\r\n    \"Sandys, the translator of 'Ovid's Metamorphoses,' and who travelled\r\n    in Turkey in 1610, gives the following passage in his 'Travailes,'\r\n    page 51 (edit. 1657). Speaking of the Turks, he says, 'Although they\r\n    be destitute of taverns, yet they have their coffee-houses, which\r\n    sometimes resemble them. There sit they chatting most of the day, and\r\n    sip of a drink called coffa, of the berry that it is made of, in\r\n    little china dishes, as hot as they can suffer it, black as soot,\r\n    which helpeth, as they say, digestion, and procureth alacrity.'\"\r\n\r\nThis pleasant sample of the puff indirect has also appended to it the\r\nnaked sentence--\r\n\r\n    \"_Adulterated with chicory, of which not less than half the sample\r\n    consists._\"\r\n\r\nThe worst kinds of adulterated coffee are to be found in that which is\r\nsold in canisters. The value of the tin envelope cannot be less than 2d.,\r\nand, as the coffee so sold is charged at the same price as that in a paper\r\nwrapper, it must be evident that a more extensive adulteration is\r\nnecessary in order to make up the difference. Such, upon examination,\r\nproves to be the case, as it appeared--\r\n\r\n    \"That the whole twenty-nine packages, bottles, and canisters submitted\r\n    to analysis, with a single exception,[5] were adulterated.\r\n\r\n    \"That in these twenty-eight adulterated samples the falsification\r\n    consisted of so-called chicory, which in many instances constituted\r\n    the chief part of the article.\r\n\r\n    \"That three of the samples contained mangold-wurzel, and two of them\r\n    roasted wheat-flour.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said it often happens that the adulterations are adulterated.\r\nChicory is an instance of it. The original fraud is found to have ramified\r\nin an endless manner; and Sir Charles Wood will doubtless be astonished to\r\nhear of the hideous crop of falsifications his most unfortunate order has\r\ncaused to spring out of the ground.\r\n\r\nImmediately the process of transforming chicory into coffee became\r\nlegalized by the Government, that article came into very extensive\r\nconsumption, and factories were set up especially for its secret\r\nmanufacture. The reason for this secrecy may be gathered from the list of\r\narticles which are made to subserve the purpose: roasted wheat, ground\r\nacorns, roasted carrots, scorched beans, roasted parsnips, mangold-wurzel,\r\nlupin-seeds, dog's biscuits, burnt sugar, _red earth_, roasted\r\nhorse-chestnuts,--and above and beyond all _baked horses' and bullocks'\r\nlivers_. This statement rests upon the authority of Mr. P. G. Simmonds, in\r\na work entitled \"Coffee as it is, and as it ought to be:\"--\r\n\r\n    \"In various parts of the metropolis,\" he says, \"but more especially in\r\n    the east, are to be found 'liver bakers.' These men take the livers of\r\n    oxen and horses, bake them, and grind them into a powder, which they\r\n    sell to the low-priced coffeeshop-keepers, at from fourpence to\r\n    sixpence per lb., horse's liver coffee being the highest price. It may\r\n    be known by allowing the coffee to stand until cold, when a thick\r\n    pellicle or skin will be found on the top. It goes farther than\r\n    coffee, and is generally _mixed with chicory_, and other vegetable\r\n    imitations of coffee.\"\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this horrible statement the sanitary commissioners of\r\nthe Lancet state that, on analysis, this substance, which\r\n\r\n    \"possessed a disagreeable animal smell, ... consisted of some\r\n    imperfectly-charred animal matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe new regulation, enjoining grocers to sell coffee and chicory properly\r\nlabelled as such, is, no doubt, observed in respectable shops; but in the\r\nlow neighbourhoods the mixture as before is passed off for genuine Mocha.\r\nHowever, the purchaser has the means of protection in his own hands. If he\r\nprefers coffee pure, let him buy the roasted berry and grind it himself;\r\nhe will thus be sure of having the real article, and will get it in\r\ngreater perfection than by purchasing it ready ground.\r\n\r\nIn close proximity to the tea and coffee-pots stand the milk-jug and the\r\nsugar-basin. What find we here? A few years ago the town was frightened\r\nfrom its propriety by a little work entitled \"Observations on London\r\nMilk,\" published by a medical gentleman of the name of Rugg, which gave\r\nsome fearful disclosures relative to the manner in which London milk was\r\nadulterated. Dr. Hassall's analyses go to show that, with the exception of\r\nthe produce of the \"iron-tailed cow,\" none of the supposed defilements\r\nreally exist, and that the milkman is a sadly maligned individual. Water\r\nis added in quantities varying in different samples from 10 to 50 per\r\ncent.; and in the more unfashionable parts of the town _all_ the cream is\r\nabstracted to be forwarded to the West-end. If milk _must_ be adulterated\r\nin large towns, water is undoubtedly the most harmless ingredient; at the\r\nsame time it will be seen what a fraud is perpetrated upon the public by\r\nselling milky water at 4d. a quart.\r\n\r\nThat the London milking-pail goes as often to the pump as to the cow we\r\nhave no manner of doubt. To bring the diluted goods up to a delicate\r\ncream colour, it is common to swing round a ball of annatto in the can;\r\nand other careful observers and writers upon the adulteration of food have\r\ndetected flour, starch, and treacle. All medical men know that children\r\nare often violently disordered by their morning or evening portion,--an\r\neffect which could not come from the mere admixture of water--and we must\r\nconfess that we ourselves believe the milkman to be a very wicked fellow.\r\n\r\nWe are afraid, if we look into the sugar-basin, we shall not find much\r\nmore comfort than in the milk-jug. We refer here to the ordinary brown\r\nsugars, such as are generally used at the breakfast-table for coffee. It\r\nis scarcely possible to procure moist sugar which is not infested with\r\nanimalculæ of the acari genus, a most disgusting class of creatures. In\r\nmany samples of sugars they swarm to that extent that the mass moves with\r\nthem; and in almost every case, by dissolving a spoonful in a wine-glass\r\nof water, dozens of them can be detected by the naked eye, either floating\r\nupon the liquid or adhering to the edge of the glass. Those who are in the\r\nhabit of \"handling\" sugars, as it is termed, are liable to a skin\r\naffection called the grocer's itch, which is believed to be occasioned by\r\nthese living inhabitants of our sugar-basins. Horrible as it is to think\r\nthat such creatures are an article in daily use, we cannot charge the\r\ngrocer directly with their introduction; the evil is, however, increased\r\nby the manner in which he mixes, or \"handles,\" as it is termed in the\r\ntrade, higher-priced sugars with muscovados, bastards, and other inferior\r\nkinds, in which the animalculæ abound.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this foreign animal element, grocers sometimes mix flour\r\nwith their sugar, and, if we are to put any credit in popular belief,\r\nsand; but of the presence of this gritty ingredient we have never seen any\r\ntrustworthy evidence. Nevertheless we have said enough to show that the\r\ntea-dealer and grocer do their best to supply the proverbial \"peck of\r\ndirt\" which all of us must eat before we die. Would that we were fed with\r\nnothing more deleterious or repulsive! Let us see, however, the base\r\nadmixtures one is liable to swallow in taking--\r\n\r\n  A CUP OF TEA _or a_ CUP OF COFFEE.\r\n\r\n  _In the Tea._\r\n\r\n  If Green--\r\n    Prussian-blue.\r\n    Turmeric.\r\n    China clay or French chalk.\r\n    Used tea-leaves.\r\n    Copperas.\r\n  If Black--\r\n    Gum.\r\n    Black lead.\r\n    Dutch pink.\r\n    Used tea-leaves.\r\n    Leaves of the ash, sloe, hawthorn, and of many other kinds.\r\n\r\n  _In the Milk._\r\n\r\n  On an average 25 per cent. of water.\r\n  Annatto.\r\n  Treacle.\r\n  Flour.\r\n  Oxide of iron.\r\n  And other unknown ingredients.\r\n\r\n  _In the Sugar._\r\n\r\n  If Brown--\r\n    Wheat flour.\r\n    Hundreds of the sugar-insect.\r\n  If White--\r\n    Albumen of bullock's blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _In the Coffee._\r\n\r\n  Chicory.\r\n\r\n  _In the Chicory._\r\n\r\n  Roast wheat.\r\n   \"    acorn.\r\n   \"    mangold-wurzel.\r\n   \"    beans.\r\n   \"    carrots.\r\n   \"    parsnips\r\n   \"    lupin-seeds.\r\n   \"    dog-biscuits.\r\n   \"    horse-chestnuts.\r\n  Oxide of iron.\r\n  Mahogany sawdust.\r\n  Baked horse's liver.\r\n   \"    bullock's liver.\r\n\r\n  _In the Milk._\r\n\r\n  Water 25 per cent.\r\n  Annatto.\r\n  Flour.\r\n  Treacle.\r\n  Oxide of iron.\r\n  And other unknown ingredients.\r\n\r\n  _In the Sugar._\r\n\r\n  If Brown--\r\n    Wheat flour.\r\n    Hundreds of the sugar-insect.\r\n  If White--\r\n    Albumen of bullock's blood.\r\n\r\nAs we perceive the teetotalers are petitioning Parliament and agitating\r\nthe towns for the closing of public-houses, we beg to present them, in\r\neither hand, with a cup of the above mixtures, with the humble hope that\r\nmeans will be found by them to supply the British public with some drink a\r\nlittle less deleterious to health, a little more pleasant to the palate,\r\nand somewhat less disgusting to the feelings. Some of the sugar impurities\r\nmay be avoided by using the crystallized East-Indian kind--the size of the\r\ncrystals not permitting of its being adulterated with inferior sorts.\r\n\r\nWe shall not dwell upon cocoa further than to state that it is a still\r\nrarer thing to obtain it pure than either tea or coffee. The almost\r\nuniversal adulterations are sugar, starch, and flours together with red\r\ncolouring matter, generally some ferruginous earth; whilst, as far as we\r\ncan see, what is termed homoeopathic cocoa is only distinguished from\r\nother kinds by the small quantity of that substance contained in it.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an article on the breakfast-table, in fact, which is\r\nwhat it seems to be. The butter, if salt, is adulterated with between 20\r\nand 30 per cent. of water. A merchant in this trade tells the _Lancet_\r\nthat \"between 40,000 and 50,000 casks of adulterated butter are annually\r\nsold in London, and the trade knows it as well as they know a bad\r\nshilling.\" Lard when cheap also finds its way to the butter-tub. Perhaps\r\nthose who flatter themselves that they use nothing but \"Epping\" will not\r\nderive much consolation from the following letter, also published in the\r\nsame journal:--\r\n\r\n    \"_To the Editor of the Lancet._\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,--Having taken apartments in the house of a butterman, I was\r\n    suddenly awoke at three o'clock one morning with a noise in the lower\r\n    part of the house, and alarmed on perceiving a light below the door of\r\n    my bed-room; conceiving the house to be on fire, I hurried down\r\n    stairs. I found the whole family busily occupied, and, on my\r\n    expressing alarm at the house being on fire, they jocosely informed me\r\n    they _were merely making Epping butter_. They unhesitatingly informed\r\n    me of the whole process. For this purpose they made use of\r\n    fresh-salted butter of a very inferior quality: this was repeatedly\r\n    washed with water in order to free it from the salt. This being\r\n    accomplished, the next process was to wash it frequently with milk,\r\n    and the manufacture was completed by the addition of a small quantity\r\n    of sugar. The amateurs of fresh Epping butter were supplied with this\r\n    dainty, which yielded my ingenious landlord a profit of at least 100\r\n    per cent., besides establishing his shop as being supplied with Epping\r\n    butter from one of the first-rate dairies.--I am, sir, your obedient\r\n    servant,\r\n\r\n    \"A STUDENT.\"\r\n\r\nIf we try marmalade as a succedaneum, we are no better off--at least if we\r\nput any faith in \"real Dundee, an excellent substitute for butter,\" to be\r\nseen piled in heaps in the cheap grocers' windows. Dr. Hassall's analysis\r\nproves that this dainty is adulterated to a large extent with turnips,\r\napples, and carrots: we need not grumble so much at these vegetable\r\nproducts, excepting on the score that it is a fraud to sell them at 7d. a\r\npound; but there is the more startling fact that, in twelve out of\r\nfourteen samples analysed, copper was detected, and sometimes in large and\r\ndeleterious quantities!\r\n\r\nAccum, in his \"Death in the Pot,\" quotes, from cookery-books of reputation\r\nin his day, recipes which make uninitiated persons stare. For instance,\r\n\"Modern Cookery, or the English Housewife,\" gives the following serious\r\ndirections \"to make Greening:\"--\"Take a bit of _verdigris the bigness of\r\nan hazel-nut_, finely powdered, half a pint of distilled vinegar, and a\r\nbit of alum-powder, with a little baysalt; put all in a bottle and shake\r\nit, and let it stand till clear. _Put a small teaspoonful into codlings,\r\nor whatever you wish to green!_\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the \"English Housekeeper,\" a book which ran through eighteen\r\neditions, directs--\"to make pickles green _boil them with halfpence_, or\r\nallow them to stand for twenty-four hours in copper or brass pans!\" Has\r\nthe notable housewife ever wondered to herself how it is that all the\r\npickles of the shops are of so much more inviting colour than her own? We\r\nwill satisfy her curiosity in a word--she has forgotten the \"bit of\r\nverdigris the bigness of a hazel-nut,\" for it is now proved beyond doubt\r\nthat to this complexion do they come by the use of copper, introduced for\r\nthe sole purpose of making them of a lively green. The analyses of twenty\r\nsamples of pickles bought of the most respectable tradesmen proved,\r\nfirstly, that the vinegar in the bottles owed most of its strength to the\r\nintroduction of sulphuric acid; secondly, that, out of sixteen different\r\npickles analysed for the purpose, copper was detected in various amounts.\r\nThus, \"two of the samples contained a small quantity; eight rather much,\r\none a considerable quantity, three a very considerable quantity; in one\r\ncopper was present in a highly deleterious amount, and in two _in\r\npoisonous amounts_. The largest quantity of this metal was found in the\r\nbottles consisting entirely of green vegetables, such as gherkins and\r\nbeans.\"\r\n\r\nWe trust after this the good housewife will feel jealous no longer, but\r\nrest satisfied that the home-made article, if less inviting and vivid in\r\ncolour, is at least more wholesome. A simple test to discover the presence\r\nof copper in such articles is to place a bright knitting-needle in the\r\nvinegar, and let it remain there for a few hours, when the deleterious\r\nmetal will speedily form a coating over it, dense or thin, according to\r\nthe amount which exists. Wherever large quantities are found, it is\r\nwilfully inserted for the purpose of producing the bright green colour,\r\nbut a small quantity may find its way into the pickles in the process of\r\nboiling in copper pans. Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, the great pickle and\r\npreserve manufacturers in Soho, immediately they became aware, from the\r\nanalyses of the _Lancet_, that such was the case, in a very praiseworthy\r\nmanner substituted silver and glass, at a great expense, for all their\r\nformer vessels. The danger arising from the introduction of this virulent\r\npoison into our food would not be so great if it were confined to pickles,\r\nof which the quantity taken is small at each meal, but it is used to paint\r\nall kinds of preserves, and fruits for winter pies and tarts are bloomed\r\nwith death. The papa who presents his children the box of sweetmeats\r\nbedded in coloured paper, and enclosed in an elegant casket, may be\r\ncorroding unawares the very springs of their existence. As a general rule,\r\nit is found that the red fruits, such as currants, raspberries, and\r\ncherries, are uncontaminated with this deleterious metal, but owe their\r\ndeep hue to some red colouring matter, such as a decoction of logwood or\r\nan infusion of beetroot, in the same way that common white cabbage is\r\nconverted into red by the nefarious pickle-merchant. The green fruits are\r\nnot all deleterious in the same degree; there seems to be an ascending\r\nscale of virulence, much after the following manner:--Limes, gooseberries,\r\nrhubarb, greengages, olives--the last-mentioned fruit, especially those of\r\nFrench preparation, generally containing verdigris, or the acetate of\r\ncopper, _in highly dangerous quantities_. The _Lancet_ publishes a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Bernays, F.C.S., dated from the Chemical Library, Derby, in which\r\nhe shows the necessity of watchfulness in the purchase of these articles\r\nof food:--\r\n\r\n    \"Of this,\" he says, \"I will give you a late instance. I had bought a\r\n    bottle of preserved gooseberries from one of the most respectable\r\n    grocers in the town, and had its contents transferred to a pie. It\r\n    struck me that the gooseberries looked fearfully green when cooked;\r\n    and in eating one with a steel fork its intense bitterness sent me in\r\n    search of the sugar. After having sweetened and mashed the\r\n    gooseberries, with the same steel fork, I was about to convey some to\r\n    my mouth, when I observed the prongs to be completely coated with a\r\n    thin film of bright metallic copper. My testimony can be borne out by\r\n    the evidence of others, two of whom dined at my table.\"\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that these three gentlemen used steel forks, which\r\ninstantly disclosed the mischief; if they had chanced to use silver, all\r\nthree might have fallen victims to these poisonous conserves.\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet at the worst. When Catherine de' Medici wished to get\r\nrid of obnoxious persons in an \"artistic\" manner, she was in the habit of\r\npresenting them with delicately made sweetmeats, or trinkets, in which\r\ndeath lurked in the most engaging manner; she carried--\r\n\r\n            \"Pure death in an earring, a casket,\r\n  A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket.\"\r\n\r\nHer poisoned feasts are matters of history, at which people shudder as\r\nthey read; but we question if the diabolical revenge and coldblooded\r\nwickedness of an Italian woman ever invented much more deadly trifles than\r\nour low, cheap confectioners do on the largest scale. We select from some\r\nof these articles of bonbonerie the following feast, which we set before\r\ndoting mothers, in order that they may see what deadly dainties are\r\nprepared for the especial delectation of their children:--\r\n\r\n    \"A FISH.\r\n\r\n    \"_Purchased in Shepherd's Market, May Fair._\r\n\r\n    \"The tip of the nose and the gills of the fish are coloured with the\r\n    usual pink, while the back and sides are highly painted with that\r\n    virulent poison _arsenite of copper_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A PIGEON.\r\n\r\n    \"_Purchased in Drury Lane._\r\n\r\n    \"The pigments employed for colouring this pigeon are light yellow for\r\n    the beak, red for the eyes, and orange yellow for the base or stand.\r\n    The yellow colour consists of the light kind of chromate of lead, for\r\n    the eyes bisulphate of mercury, and for the stand the deeper varieties\r\n    of chromate of lead, or orange chrome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"APPLES.\r\n\r\n    \"_Purchased in James Street, Covent Garden._\r\n\r\n    \"The apples in this sample are coloured yellow, and on one side deep\r\n    red; the yellow colour extending to a considerable depth in the\r\n    substance of the sugar. The red consists of the usual non-metallic\r\n    pigment, and the yellow is due to the presence of CHROMATE OF LEAD in\r\n    really _poisonous amount_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A COCK.\r\n\r\n    \"_Purchased in Drury Lane._\r\n\r\n    \"The beak of the bird is coloured bright yellow, the comb brilliant\r\n    red, the wings and tail are variegated, black, two different reds, and\r\n    yellow; while the stand, as in most of these sugar ornaments, is\r\n    painted green. The yellow of the beak consists of CHROMATE OF LEAD;\r\n    the comb and part of the red colour on the back and wings is\r\n    VERMILION; while the second red colour on the wings and tail is the\r\n    usual pink non-metallic colouring matter, and the stripes of yellow\r\n    consist of gamboge; lastly, the green of the stand is MIDDLE BRUNSWICK\r\n    GREEN, and, therefore, contains CHROMATE OF LEAD. In the colouring of\r\n    this article, then, no less than three active poisons are employed, as\r\n    well as that drastic purgative gamboge!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"ORANGES.\r\n\r\n    \"_Purchased in Pilgrim Street, Doctors' Commons._\r\n\r\n    \"This is a very unnatural imitation of an orange, it being coloured\r\n    with a coarse and very uneven coating of RED LEAD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"MIXED SUGAR ORNAMENTS.\r\n\r\n    \"_Purchased in Middle Row, Holborn._\r\n\r\n    \"The confectionery in this parcel is made up into a variety of forms\r\n    and devices, as hats, jugs, baskets, and dishes of fruit and\r\n    vegetables. One of the hats is coloured yellow with CHROMATE OF LEAD,\r\n    and has a green hatband round it, coloured with ARSENITE OF COPPER; a\r\n    second hat is white, with a blue hatband, the pigment being\r\n    PRUSSIAN-BLUE. The baskets are coloured yellow with CHROMATE OF LEAD.\r\n    Into the colouring of the pears and peaches the usual non-metallic\r\n    pigment, together with CHROMATE OF LEAD and MIDDLE BRUNSWICK GREEN,\r\n    enter largely; while the carrots represented in a dish are coloured\r\n    throughout with a RED OXIDE OF LEAD, and the tops with BRUNSWICK\r\n    GREEN. This is one of the worst of all the samples of coloured sugar\r\n    confectionery submitted to analysis, as it contains no less than four\r\n    _deadly poisons_!\"\r\n\r\nThe painted feast contains, then, among its highly injurious ingredients,\r\nferrocyanide of iron or Prussian-blue, Antwerp-blue, gamboge, and\r\nultramarine, and among its deadly poisons the three chrome yellows, red\r\nlead, white lead, vermilion, the three Brunswick greens, and Scheele's\r\ngreen or arsenite of copper. The wonder is that, considering we set such\r\npoison-traps for children, ten times more enticing and quite as deadly as\r\nthose used to bane rats, that the greater number of youngsters who partake\r\nof them are not at once despatched; and so undoubtedly they would be if\r\nnurses were not cautious about these coloured parts, which have always\r\nenjoyed a bad name under the general denomination of \"trash and messes.\"\r\nAs it is, we are informed by Dr. Letheby that \"no less than seventy cases\r\nof poisoning have been traced to this source\" within three years!\r\n\r\nIn France, Belgium, and Switzerland the colouring of confectionery with\r\npoisonous pigments is prohibited, and the vendors are held responsible for\r\nall accidents which may occur to persons from eating their sugar\r\nconfectionery. It is absolutely essential that some such prohibition\r\nshould be made in England. Arsenic, according to law, must be sold\r\ncoloured with soot, in order that its hue may prevent its being used by\r\nmistake for other substances; how absurd it is that we should allow other\r\npoisons, quite as virulent, to be mixed with the food of children and\r\nadults, merely for the sake of the colour! All kinds of sugar-plums,\r\ncomfits, and \"kisses,\" in addition to being often adulterated with large\r\nquantities of plaster of Paris, are always open to the suspicion of being\r\npoisoned. Necessity cannot be urged for the continuance of this wicked\r\npractice, as there are plenty of vegetable pigments which, if not quite as\r\nvivid as the acrid mineral ones, are sufficiently so to please the eye. Of\r\nlate years a peculiar lozenge has been introduced, in which the flavour of\r\ncertain fruits is singularly imitated. Thus we have essence of jargonel\r\ndrops, essence of pine-apple drops, and many others of a most delicate\r\ntaste. They really are so delicious that we scarcely like to create a\r\nprejudice against them; but the truth is great, and must prevail: all\r\nthese delicate essences are made from a preparation of æther and rancid\r\ncheese and butter.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer, perhaps unaware of the cumulative action of many of his\r\nchemicals, thinks that the small quantity can do no harm. We have seen, in\r\nthe matter of preserved fruits and sugar confectionery, how fallacious is\r\nthat idea. But the practice of adulteration often leads to lamentable\r\nresults of the same nature, which are quite unintentional on the part of\r\ntheir perpetrators, and which occur in the most roundabout manner. An\r\ninstance of this is related by Accum, which goes directly to the point. A\r\ngentleman, perceiving that an attack of colic always supervened upon\r\ntaking toasted Gloucestershire cheese at an inn at which he was in the\r\nhabit of stopping, and having also noticed that a kitten which had\r\npartaken of its rind was rendered violently sick, had the food analyzed,\r\nwhen it was found that lead was present in it in poisonous quantities.\r\nFollowing up his inquiries, he ascertained that the maker of the cheese,\r\nnot finding his annatto sufficiently deep in colour, had resorted to the\r\nexpedient of colouring the commodity with vermilion. This mixture,\r\nalthough pernicious and discreditable, was not absolutely poisonous, and\r\ncertainly could not account for the disastrous effects of the food on the\r\nhuman system. Trying back still further, however, it was at last found\r\nthat the druggist who sold the vermilion had mixed with it a portion of\r\n_red lead_, imagining that the pigment was only required for house paint.\r\n\"Thus,\" as Accum remarks, \"the druggist sold his vermilion, in a regular\r\nway of trade, adulterated with red lead, to increase his profit, without\r\nany suspicion of the use to which it would be applied; and the purchaser\r\nwho adulterated the annatto, presuming that the vermilion was genuine, had\r\nno hesitation in heightening the colour of his annatto with so harmless an\r\nadjunct. Thus, through the diversified and circulatory operations of\r\ncommerce, a portion of deadly poison may find admission into the\r\nnecessaries of life in a way that can attach no criminality to the parties\r\nthrough whose hands it has successively passed.\" The curious aspect of\r\nthis circuitous kind of poisoning is, that it occurs through the belief of\r\neach adulterating rogue in the honesty of his neighbour.\r\n\r\nIf we could possibly eliminate, from the mass of human disease, that\r\noccasioned by the constant use of deleterious food, we should find that it\r\namounted to a very considerable percentage on the whole, and that one of\r\nthe best friends of the doctor would prove to be the adulterator. But even\r\nour refuge fails us in our hour of need; the tools of the medical man,\r\nlike those of the sappers and miners before Sebastopol, often turn out to\r\nbe worthless. Drugs and medical comforts are perhaps adulterated as\r\nextensively as any other article. To mention only a few familiar and\r\nhousehold medicines for instance: Epsom salts are adulterated with\r\nsulphate of soda; carbonate of soda with sulphate of soda--a very\r\ninjurious substitute. Mercury is sometimes falsified with lead, tin, and\r\nbismuth; gentian with the poisonous drugs aconite and belladonna; rhubarb\r\nwith turmeric and gamboge; cantharides with black pepper; and cod-liver\r\nand castor-oils with common and inferior oils; whilst opium, one of the\r\nsheet-anchors of the physician, is adulterated to the greatest extent in a\r\ndozen different ways. Medical comforts are equally uncertain. Thus\r\npotato-flour forms full half of the so-called arrowroots of commerce;\r\nsago-meal is another very common ingredient in this nourishing substance.\r\nOut of fifty samples of so-styled arrowroot, Dr. Hassall found twenty-two\r\nadulterated, many of them consisting _entirely_ of potato-flour and\r\nsago-meal. One half of the common oatmeals to be met with are adulterated\r\nwith barley-meal, a much less nutritious substance--an important fact,\r\nwhich boards of guardians should be acquainted with. Honey is\r\nsophisticated with flour-starch and sugar-starch. And lastly, we wish to\r\nsay something important to mothers. Put no faith in the hundred and one\r\npreparations of farinaceous food for infants which are paraded under so\r\nmany attractive titles. They are all composed of wheat-flour,\r\npotato-flour, sago, &c.,--very familiar ingredients, which would not take\r\nwith anxious parents unless christened with extraordinary names, for which\r\ntheir compounders demand an extraordinary charge. To invalids we would\r\nalso say, place no reliance on the Revalentas and Ervalentas advertised\r\nthrough the country as cures for all imaginary diseases. They consist\r\nalmost entirely of lentil-powder, barley-flour, &c., which are charged\r\ncent. per cent. above their real value.\r\n\r\nOf all the articles we have touched upon, not one is so important as\r\nwater. It mixes more or less with all our solid food, and forms\r\nnine-tenths of all our drinks. Man himself, as a sanitary writer has\r\nobserved, is in great part made up of this element, and if you were to put\r\nhim under a press you would squeeze out of him 8-1/2 pailfuls. That it\r\nshould be furnished pure to the consumer is of the first importance in a\r\nsanitary and economic point of view. We are afraid, however, that but\r\nfeeble attempts have been made to secure this advantage to the metropolis.\r\nAt present London, with its two and a half millions of population, is\r\nmainly supplied by nine water companies, six of which derive their supply\r\nfrom the Thames, one from the New River, one from the Ravensbourne, and a\r\nthird from ponds and wells. Besides this supply, which ramifies like a\r\nnetwork over the whole metropolis, we find dotted about both public and\r\nprivate wells of various qualities. We do not intend to follow Dr. Hassall\r\ninto his microscopic representations of the organic matter, vegetable and\r\nanimal, by which the customers of one company can compare the water served\r\nto them with that dealt out to others, and thus at a glance assure\r\nthemselves that they have not more than their share of many-legged,\r\ncountless-jointed, hideous animalculæ, which look formidable enough to\r\nfrighten one from ever touching a drop of London water, but shall content\r\nourselves with giving the general characteristics of the whole of them.\r\nWith one exception they were all of a hardness ranging from 11 to 18\r\ndegrees. This hardness depends upon the earthy salts present, such as\r\nsulphates and bicarbonates of lime and magnesia. They were also to some\r\nextent saline, as all the salt used in the metropolis ultimately finds its\r\nway into the Thames, or great sewer-stream. Not long ago two, at least, of\r\nthese six Thames water companies procured their supply within a short\r\ndistance of the mouths of great drains, and all of them resorted to the\r\nriver at different points below Battersea, or that portion of it which\r\nreceives the drainage of the metropolis, and is consequently crowded with\r\nanimal and vegetable matter, both living and dead, and thick with the mud\r\nstirred up by the passage to and fro of the steamers. The violent outcry\r\nmade, however, by the Board of Health, caused an Act to be passed by\r\nparliament against the supply of the sewage rates, and now all the\r\ncompanies taking their supplies from the Thames, are compelled to go at\r\nleast as high as Kingston, and to submit them to a process of filtration;\r\nbut even at this point the river is in some degree sewage-tainted, and\r\nthe chemically-combined portion of baser matter cannot be removed by any\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nThe impurities of the Thames are not all we have to deal with--its\r\nhardness must cost the Londoners hundreds of thousands a year in the\r\narticle of soap alone. The action upon lead is also marked; hence we find\r\npoisonous carbonates of that metal held in solution. Plumbers are well\r\naware of this fact, and frequently meet with leaden cisterns deeply\r\ncorroded. This corrosion may arise from either chemical or voltaic action.\r\nThe junction of lead and solder, or iron, immersed in water impregnated\r\nwith salts or acid of any kind, will cause erosion of the metal. A\r\nfamiliar instance of this is seen in the rapid manner in which iron\r\nrailings rust away just where they are socketed in the stonework with\r\nlead. The presence of a piece of mortar on the lead of a cistern may even\r\nset up this action, and result in giving a whole family the colic.\r\n\r\nThe pumps of the metropolis are liable to even more contamination than\r\nriver-water, inasmuch as the soil surrounding them is saturated with the\r\nsewage of innumerable cesspools, and with that arising from the leakage of\r\nimperfect drains. Medical men entertained the opinion that the terrible\r\noutbreak of cholera in Broad Street, Golden Square, in 1854, arose from\r\nthe fact that the people in the neighbourhood were in the habit of\r\nvisiting a public pump which was proved to be foul with drain-water, and\r\nthe handle of which was taken off, to prevent further mischief. Some of\r\nthese public pumps appear to yield excellent water--cold, clear, and\r\npalatable; but the presence of these qualities by no means proves that\r\nthey are pure. The bright sparkling icy water issuing from the famous\r\nAldgate pump, according to Mr. Simon, the city officer of health, owes its\r\nmost prized qualities to the nitrates which have filtered into the well\r\nfrom the decaying animal matter in an adjoining churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe porter and stout of the metropolis have long been famous. The virtues\r\nof the latter drink are celebrated all over the world; and a royal duke,\r\nascribed the great mortality among the guards in the East to the want of\r\ntheir favourite beverage. No doubt the pure liquor, as it comes from the\r\ngreat brewers, is wholesome and strengthening; but it no sooner gets into\r\nthe possession of the publicans than, in a great majority of cases, the\r\narticle is made up. A stranger would naturally suppose that the foaming\r\ntankard of Meux's entire which he quaffs at the \"Marquis of Granby\" has an\r\nidentical flavour with that at the \"Blue Boar,\" where the same brewer's\r\nname shines resplendent on the house-front. Not a bit of it: one shall be\r\nsmooth, pleasantly bitter, slightly acid, and beaded with a fine and\r\npersistent froth; the other, bitter with the bitterness of soot, salt,\r\nclammy, sweet, and frothing with a coarse and evanescent froth. The body\r\nof the liquor is undoubtedly the same, but the variations are all supplied\r\nby the publicans and sinners. We do not make _émeutes_, as they are\r\ncontinually doing in Bavaria, on account of our beer; but we have strong\r\nfeelings on a matter of such national importance; and the wicked ways of\r\nbrewers and publicans have been made, over and over again, the subject of\r\nparliamentary inquiry. The reports of various committees prove that, in\r\ntimes past, porter and stout were doctored in the most ingenious manner,\r\nand so universally and unreservedly, that a trade sprang up termed\r\nbrewers' druggists, whose whole business it was to supply to the\r\nmanufacturers and retailers of the national beverage, ingredients for its\r\nadulteration; nay, to such an extent did the taste for falsifying beer and\r\nporter extend, that one genius, hight Jackson, wrote a hand-book to show\r\nthe brewers how to make Beer _without any Malt or Hops at all_! Accum has\r\npreserved, in his now antique pages, some of the recipes in vogue in his\r\nday. The boldness with which our fathers went to work is amusing. For\r\ninstance, Mr. Child, in his \"Practical Treatise on Brewing,\" after having\r\nmade his non-professional reader aghast by mentioning a score of\r\npernicious articles to be used in beer, remarks, in the mildest possible\r\nmanner,--\r\n\r\n    \"That, however much they may surprise--however pernicious or\r\n    disagreeable they may appear, he has always found them requisite in\r\n    the brewing of porter, and he thinks they must invariably be used by\r\n    those who wish to continue the taste, flavour, and effervescence of\r\n    the beer. And, though several acts of Parliament have been passed to\r\n    prevent porter brewers from using many of them, yet the author can\r\n    affirm, from experience, he could never produce the present flavoured\r\n    porter without them. _The intoxicating qualities of porter are to be\r\n    ascribed to the various drugs intermixed with it._ It is evident some\r\n    porter is more heady than other, and it arises from the greater or\r\n    less quantity of stupefying ingredients. Malt, to produce\r\n    intoxication, must be used in such large quantities as would very much\r\n    diminish, if not totally exclude, the brewer's profit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this extract that Mr. Child considered the end of all\r\nsuccessful brewing was to make people dead-drunk at the cheapest possible\r\nrate, regardless of consequences. Among the ingredients that Mr. Morris,\r\nanother instructor in the art of brewing, tells us are requisite to\r\nproduce a popular article, are--cocculus indicus and beans, as\r\nintoxicators; calamus aromaticus, as a substitute for hops; quassia, as a\r\nbitter; coriander-seeds to give flavour; capsicums, carraway-seeds,\r\nginger, and grains of paradise, to give warmth; whilst oyster-shells are\r\nrecommended to afford a touch of youth to old beer, and alum to give a\r\n\"smack of age\" to new; and when it is desired to bring it more rapidly\r\n\"forward,\" the presiding Hecate is told to drop sulphuric acid into her\r\nbrew; by this means an imitation of the age of eighteen months was given\r\nin a few instants. Even the \"fine cauliflower head,\" which is held to be\r\nthe sign of excellence in stout, was--and, for all we know, still\r\nis--artificially made by mixing with the article a detestable compound\r\ncalled \"beer-headings,\" composed of common green vitriol, alum, and salt,\r\nand sometimes by the simple addition of salts of steel. That these\r\narticles were commonly employed we have the evidence of the Excise\r\nDepartment, which published a long list of such ingredients seized by them\r\non the premises of brewers and brewers' druggists.[6] Many of these\r\nglaring adulterations are probably no longer in general use, although,\r\nfrom the evidence given before a recent committee of the House of\r\nCommons, it is believed that sulphuric acid, salt of steel, sulphate of\r\niron, and cocculus indicus are still resorted to by the smaller brewers,\r\nespecially those living in the country--a belief very much strengthened by\r\nthe very odd taste we sometimes find in ales and porters, and which is\r\ncertainly not derived from malt and hops. The common method of\r\nadulterating the national liquor is by mixing water with it. This is done\r\nalmost universally by the publican, and to a very extraordinary extent. A\r\ncomparison between the per-centage of alcohol to be found in a given\r\nnumber of samples of porter and stout, procured from what is termed\r\nbrewers' taps, or agents, with that existing in a similar number of\r\nsamples purchased of publicans, proves this fact in a very convincing\r\nmanner. Dr. Hassall informs us that, with regard to the stouts,--\r\n\r\n    \"The alcohol--of specific gravity 796, temperature 60°\r\n    Fahr.--contained in the former samples ranged from 7·15 per cent. the\r\n    highest, to 4·53 the lowest; whereas that of the stouts procured from\r\n    publicans varied, with one exception, from 4·87 per cent. to 3·25 per\r\n    cent.\"\r\n\r\nThe same difference of strength also existed between the various samples\r\nof porter procured from the two sources; the amount of alcohol in that\r\nobtained from the taps varying from 4·51 per cent. to 2·42 per cent.,\r\nwhereas that purchased of publicans ranged from 3·97 per cent. to 1·81 per\r\ncent. The mixture of water, of course, reduces the colour, to bring up\r\nwhich both burnt sugar and molasses are extensively used; and, in order\r\nthat \"the appetite may grow with what it feeds on,\" tobacco and salt are\r\ncopiously added by the publican. Beer, porter, and stout are also liable\r\nto be contaminated by the presence of lead. The universal use of pumping\r\nmachines and the storing of the casks in the cellars, sometimes at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the bar, necessitates the use of long leaden\r\npipes, in passing through which the liquid, if \"stale\" or sour, oxidates a\r\nportion of the lead. This fact is so well known both to public and\r\npublican, that the first pot or two drawn in the morning is generally set\r\naside, as, from having lain all night in the pipe, it is justly considered\r\ninjurious. The liberality of the barmaid in thus sacrificing a portion of\r\nthe liquor is more apparent than real. The reader has, perhaps, noticed\r\nthat most public-house counters are fitted up with metal tops, in which\r\ngratings are inserted to drain off all the spilt liquor, drainings of\r\nglasses, heel-taps of pots, &c.: down these gratings goes \"the first\r\ndraught,\" with its dose of oxide of lead. The receptacle below, which\r\ncontains all this refuse together with that at the bottoms of barrels, the\r\npublican either returns to the brewer, or empties it himself into\r\nhalf-filled casks.\r\n\r\nThe public were very needlessly alarmed some years ago by a statement made\r\nby M. Payen, a celebrated French chemist, that strychnine was being made\r\nfor England, where it was used in the manufacture of the bitter beer of\r\nthis country. This statement was copied by the _Medical Times_, and from\r\nthence, finding its way to Printing-house Square, became generally\r\ndiffused, to the horror and discomfiture of pale-ale drinkers; and not\r\nwithout reason, when it is remembered that one-sixth of a grain of this\r\npoison has been known to prove fatal, and a very much smaller quantity\r\ndaily taken, to have the effect of inducing tetanic spasms, and of\r\notherwise seriously injuring the nervous system. We are happy to be able\r\nto state that the lovers of Bass and Allsopp may quaff their tonic draught\r\nin future without any fear of such terrible results. The bitterness of\r\npale ale has been found, on analysis, to be entirely due to the extract of\r\nhops. Furthermore, this beverage, when selected from the stores of the\r\nbrewers or their agents, has universally proved to be perfectly pure. We\r\nsay, from the stores of the Burton brewers or their agents, because there\r\nis no absolute certainty of procuring the article genuine from any other\r\nsource. The label on the bottle is no sure guarantee; for used bottles,\r\nwith their labels intact, are in many instances refilled by publicans with\r\nan inferior article, and sold, of course, at the price of the real. We\r\nhave good reason to believe that this trick is very often practised in a\r\nvariety of instances, to the manifest injury of the public and brewers.\r\n\r\nWine is far too wide a subject to be treated here. The great mass of\r\nports at a cheap and moderate price are made up, it is well known, of\r\nseveral kinds, and doctored according to cost. There is one compound,\r\nhowever, which particularly claims our attention, \"publicans' port.\" We\r\nare all of us familiar with the announcement to be seen in the windows of\r\nsuch tradesmen, \"Fine old crusty port, 2_s._ 9_d._ a bottle;\" and the\r\nextraordinary thing is, that upon opening the sample we often find that\r\n_it is_ crusted, and that the cork is deeply stained. How can they afford\r\nto sell an article bearing the appearance of such age and quality at so\r\nlow a price? The answer is simple: wine, crust, and stained cork are\r\nfabricated. There is a manufactory in London, where, by a chemical\r\nprocess, they get up beeswing to perfection, and deposit it in the bottles\r\nso as exactly to imitate the natural crust; here corks are also stained to\r\nassume any age that is required. The wine itself contains a very little\r\ninferior port, the rest being composed of cheap red French wine, brandy,\r\nand logwood as a colouring matter, if required. The port wine sold over\r\nthe bar at 3_d._ a glass--and we are assured that this article is making\r\nits way in preference to gin in the low neighbourhoods, one gin palace, to\r\nour knowledge, selling a butt a week over the counter--is an inferior\r\narticle even to this, and its taste is quite sufficient to prove that only\r\nan infinitesimal portion of it ever came from Oporto.\r\n\r\nLondon gin, under a hundred names, is notoriously a compound. Most people\r\nflatter themselves that its peculiar flavour is due to the admixture of\r\nsugar and juniper-berries alone. It is, however, a much more elaborate\r\nconcoction than the public imagine. Those accustomed to the unsweetened\r\nWest Country gin think the London article only fit to drink when raw, and\r\nin many cases they are right; for the publican and inferior\r\nspirit-dealers, like milkmen, are great customers of the pump. It appears\r\nthat some of the samples examined by the analyst contained only half as\r\nmuch alcohol as was present in others; and as the gin of commerce is never\r\nabove proof, it follows that these specimens were scarcely as good as\r\n\"stiff\" gin-and-water. So much for the pure spirit; now for the fancy\r\nwork or \"flavourings.\" The quantity of sugar in the samples examined\r\nranged from 3 oz. 4 drms. 23 grains, to 13 oz. 4 drms.; two of them\r\ncontained oil of cinnamon, or, more probably, of cassia; seven contained\r\ncayenne pepper, some of them in very large quantities; and most of the\r\nsamples contained combined sulphates; whilst there is good authority for\r\nstating that sulphate of zinc, or white vitriol, is often used. The very\r\n\"beaded bubbles winking at the brim,\" which are considered to be a proof\r\nof the strength of the article, are produced artificially. Mr. Mitchell,\r\nin his \"Handbook of Commerce,\" states that this is done by adding a\r\nmixture compounded of alum, carbonate of potash, almond-oil, sulphuric\r\nacid, and spirits of wine. \"The earth hath bubbles as the water hath, and\r\nthese are of them.\" One would think that it would be to the interest of\r\nthe trade to keep their illicit practices \"dark:\" but the publican has his\r\n\"Handbook\" to teach him how to adulterate spirit as well as beer. For\r\ninstance, in a little work on Brewing and Distilling, written by a Mr.\r\nShannon, the following recipe is given:--\r\n\r\n    \"_To reduce unsweetened Gin._\r\n\r\n    A tun of fine gin                         252 gallons.\r\n    Water                                      36    \"\r\n                                              ---\r\n    Which added together makes                288    \"\r\n    _The doctor is now put on_, and\r\n      it is further reduced with water         19    \"\r\n                                              ---\r\n    Which gives                               307 gallons.\r\n\r\n    \"This done, let one pound of alum be just covered with water, and\r\n    dissolved by boiling; _rummage_ the whole together, and pour in the\r\n    alum, and the whole will be fine in a few days.\"\r\n\r\nWe wonder that Mr. Gough, the great temperance advocate, never armed\r\nhimself with one of these recipes, in order to convince people of the\r\nnoxious liquids they are invited to drink under the most inviting names.\r\nIn every quarter of the town we see gin-palaces seizing upon the corner\r\nhouses of the streets, just as scrofula seizes upon the joints of the\r\nhuman frame, and through their ever-open doors streams of squalid wretches\r\nare continually pouring in and out. Could they be informed that they enter\r\nto gulp oil of vitriol, oil of turpentine, and sulphuric acid, among other\r\nacrid and deleterious compounds--that the tap of the publican spouts\r\ncorroding fire, like that which leaped up from the wooden table at the\r\ncommand of Mephistopheles, in Auerbach's cellar, they would feel inclined\r\nto exclaim with Siebald to the fiend:--\r\n\r\n  \"What, sir, how dare you practise thus\r\n  Your hocus-pocus upon us?\"\r\n\r\nGin, it appears, is almost exclusively doctored in this highly deleterious\r\nmanner, although all spirits are open to sophistication, but especially\r\nbrandy, which, on account of its price, pays well for the trouble. Mr.\r\nShannon, deeply versed in the \"art and mystery\" of the trade of the\r\npublican, informs us that brandy should be \"made up\" for \"retail\" by the\r\naddition of 10 per cent. of flavoured raisin wine, a little of the\r\ntincture of grains of paradise, cherry-laurel water, and spirit of\r\nalmond-cake: \"add also 10 handfuls of oak sawdust, and give it\r\n_complexion_ with burnt sugar.\"\r\n\r\nIf we can give the dram-drinker little comfort, we can at least reassure\r\nthe smoker. \"Everybody says\" that common cigars are made out of cabbages,\r\nand tobacco has always been suspected of containing many adulterations.\r\nThese charges have been made, however, at random, and the result of\r\nchemical analysis and examinations by the microscope has proved that this\r\narticle of daily consumption is remarkably pure. The carefully-searching\r\nmicroscope of Dr. Hassall has not succeeded in finding any other than the\r\ngenuine leaf among forty samples of manufactured tobacco; neither were\r\nthere any sophistications discovered, with the exceptions of salt, sugar,\r\nand water. An inquiry into the specimens of the rolled and twisted article\r\nwas equally consoling to the maker and chewer. Now and then, it is true,\r\nthe excise officers make seizures in the warehouses of the tobacco\r\nmanufacturers, of dock, rhubarb, coltsfoot, and other leaves, but to a\r\nvery insignificant extent, considering the value of the article and the\r\nheavy duty upon it.\r\n\r\nHe who, like Byron, prefers the naked beauties of the leaf in the shape of\r\na cigar, will be equally gratified to hear that such a thing as\r\nadulteration scarcely exists in this form of tobacco--at least, not when\r\npurchased in the shops. Even if we descend to a penny \"Pickwick,\" we find\r\nnothing in it but the pure leaf. Out of fifty-seven samples examined, only\r\none was sophisticated, and that, apparently from its contents, by\r\naccident. The only adulterated samples discovered at all, were exactly\r\nwhere we might have expected to have found them, in the possession of a\r\nhawker at Whitechapel. These, on examination, turned out to be made up of\r\ntwo twisted wrappers or layers of thin paper, tinted of a bistre colour,\r\nwhile the interior consisted entirely of hay, not a particle of tobacco\r\nentering into their composition. The second example of a spurious cigar\r\nwas purchased at a review in Hyde Park. It consisted externally of\r\ntobacco-leaf, but was made internally of hay. Our readers are familiar\r\nenough with the fellows who vend these fraudulent articles, made to sell\r\nand not to smoke; they are generally to be found at fairs and races, or\r\nany crowded place in the open air, where they can escape speedily from\r\ntheir victimized customers. There is a class of men who make a very good\r\nlivelihood in the metropolis by perambulating the streets and looking out\r\nfor ingenuous youths. Towards such they furtively approach, and, like the\r\ntempter of old, whisper in their ear of forbidden fruit. The unwary are\r\nconstantly taken in by one of these serpents, in the shape of a sailor\r\nstraight from the docks, who intimates, in a hurried manner, that, if we\r\nwanted any \"smuggled cigars,\" he has just a box to sell cheap round the\r\ncorner. In general these worthies need not fear the exciseman, as the\r\narticle they have to sell does not come under the name of tobacco at all.\r\n\r\nIf, however, cigars are not open to the charge of being adulterated, they\r\nare the subject of innumerable frauds, inasmuch as those of English\r\nmanufacture are passed off as foreign ones. Thus, the so-called Bengal\r\ncheroots are _all_ home-made imitations of Chinsurah cheroots. In order to\r\npass them off as the genuine article they are sold in boxes, branded and\r\nlabelled in exact imitation of those sent from India. It may be asked why\r\nsuch cigars, if made out of the tobacco-leaf, are not as good as those of\r\nEastern or Spanish manufacture. The real reason is, that the tobacco loses\r\nmuch of its fine flavour and aroma by packing and keeping; otherwise the\r\nEnglish cigar would be equal to any other. The old impression that the\r\nManilla cheroot is impregnated with opium would not appear to be correct,\r\nfrom the investigations of Dr. Hassall, who has failed to discover that\r\nnarcotic in any of the specimens which he tested for it.\r\n\r\nWe have to mention one preparation of tobacco of which we cannot speak\r\nquite so favourably as of the others. Snuff is, we are sorry to say,\r\nvilely adulterated, and some kinds poisonously. The law allows the use of\r\nsalt and water and lime-water in its manufacture--a privilege which the\r\nsnuff-makers take advantage of to increase its weight, all moist snuffs\r\naveraging full twenty-five per cent. of water. If these were the only\r\nadulterations to the titillating powder, no harm would be done; but we\r\nhave positive evidence afforded us in the report of the \"Lancet\"\r\nCommission, that, in addition to ferruginous earths, such as red and\r\nyellow ochre, no less than three poisonous preparations are also\r\nintroduced into it--chromate of lead, red-lead, and bichromate of potash!\r\nWhen a man taps his snuff-box and takes out a pinch, he little dreams that\r\nhe is introducing an enemy into his system, which in the long-run might\r\nmaster his nerves and produce paralysis; nevertheless it is an undoubted\r\nfact. Many persons have been deprived of the use of their limbs through a\r\npersistence in taking snuff adulterated with lead in less proportions than\r\nthat found in the samples examined by Dr. Hassall. Bi-chromate of potash\r\nis a still more deadly poison. M. Duchâtel of Paris found that dogs were\r\ndestroyed by doses of from one twenty-fifth of a grain to one\r\nfive-hundredth of a grain. We have heard of inveterate snuffers keeping\r\nthis comfort open in their waistcoat pockets, and helping themselves by\r\nfingers'-full at a time; if their snuff contained anything like the\r\nproportion of deleterious ingredients now to be found in the same article,\r\n\"dropped hands\" and colic would soon have cured them of this dirty and\r\ndisagreeable habit.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to follow further the trail which Accum and others,\r\nand more lately and particularly Dr. Hassall, have discovered for us.\r\nBefore closing the pages of the latter gentleman's report, however, from\r\nwhich we have drawn so largely, we cannot avoid stating that the\r\ncommunity is under the greatest obligation to both himself and the editor\r\nof the _Lancet_--to the one for the energy with which he pursued his\r\nsubject, and to the other for his singular boldness in rendering himself\r\nliable for the many actions which the publication of the names of\r\nevil-doers was likely to bring upon his journal, a liability which Dr.\r\nHassall has since taken upon himself by the reprint of the report under\r\nhis own name. This report is, in fact, as far as it goes, a handbook to\r\nthe honest and fraudulent food-dealers in the metropolis; and every man\r\nwho values wholesome aliment, and thinks it a duty to society to support\r\nthe honest tradesman in preference to the rogue, should procure it as a\r\nvaluable work of reference. We have not followed the author into\r\npersonalities, as no further purpose could be served by so doing; but we\r\nhave shown enough to convince the public that the grossest fraud reigns\r\nthroughout the British public commissariat. Like a set of monkeys, every\r\nman's hand is seen in his neighbour's dish. The baker takes in the grocer,\r\nthe grocer defrauds the publican, the publican \"does\" the pickle\r\nmanufacturer, and the pickle-maker fleeces and poisons all the rest.[7]\r\n\r\nAs guardian of the revenue, the government is deeply interested in this\r\nquestion, independently of the view it must take of its moral aspect, for\r\nthe excise is without doubt cheated to the extent of hundreds of thousands\r\na year by the same unlawful practices which demoralize a large portion of\r\nthe community, and defraud and deceive the remainder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo furnish every possible link in the grand procession of organized life,\r\nis the aim of the science of zoology. Its professors have explored the\r\nwilds of Africa, and have penetrated far into the interior of South\r\nAmerica; have endured the last extremities of hunger and thirst to catch\r\nsome curious humming-bird; have been consumed by fevers to the very socket\r\nof life, in order to pin an unknown beetle, or to procure some rare and\r\ngorgeous-coloured fly. The passion for this science seems to have long\r\ndwelt in the English race: our love of field-sports, and keen relish of\r\nrural life, coupled with a habit of minute observation, have all had a\r\ntendency to foster an acquaintance with the beasts of the field and the\r\nfowls of the air, and scarcely a village but boasts of some follower of\r\nWhite or Waterton. This taste we carry with us to our vast colonial\r\npossessions, and to that chain of military posts whose morning guns echo\r\nround the world. With such splendid opportunities for observing and\r\ncollecting animals, we have succeeded in gathering together a menagerie\r\nwhich is by far the first in existence, and which includes typical forms\r\nof most living things--from the chimpanzee, in whose face and structure we\r\ntrace the last step but one of the highest form of mammal, to the\r\nzoophyte, which shakes hands with the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nAncient Rome, it is true, in her degenerate days, witnessed vaster\r\ncollections of animals, and saw hippopotami, ostriches, and giraffes,\r\ntogether with the fiercer carnivora, turned by hundreds into the arena;\r\nbut how different the spirit with which they were collected! With the\r\ndebased and profligate Roman emperors the only object of these bloody\r\nshows was to gratify the brutal appetite of their people for slaughter;\r\nwith us the intention is to display the varying wonders of creation.\r\n\r\nMost of our readers in the full flush of summer have leaned over the\r\nbalustrade of the carnivora terrace. From this elevated situation the\r\nwhole plan of the south side of the grounds is exposed. To his right,\r\nfringing a still pool whose translucent waters mirror them as they stand,\r\nthe spectator sees the collection of storks and cranes: more immediately\r\nin front of him softly tread the llamas and alpacas--the beasts of burthen\r\nof the New World: farther, again, we see the deer in their paddocks; and\r\nbeyond, the sedgy pools of the water-fowl, set in the midst of graceful\r\nshrubberies which close the Gardens in from the landscape of the Regent's\r\nPark. Passing over to the northern side of the terrace he sees the eagle\r\naviary, tenanted by its royal and solitary-looking occupants; the otters\r\nswimming their merry round, and perchance the seal flapping beside his\r\npool; while the monkeys, with incredible rapidity and constant chatter,\r\nswing and leap about their wire enclosure Immediately beneath him the\r\nPolar bears pace to and fro, or, swaying their heads, walk backwards with\r\na firmness which a lord chamberlain might study with advantage; and close\r\nat hand the long neck of the \"ship of the desert\" is seen sailing out from\r\nthe gateway of the pretty clock-house. That the dread monarch of the\r\nforest and the other \"great cats\" are beneath his feet, he is made aware\r\nby angry growls and the quivering sound of shaken iron bars, as the keeper\r\ngoes round with his daily beef-barrow. No one can help feeling a certain\r\nsense of strangeness at seeing these creatures of all climes scattered\r\namid a flourishing garden--to witness beasts, ensanguined in tooth and\r\nclaw, impatiently pacing to and fro between banks of scarlet geraniums or\r\nbeds brilliant with the countless blooms of early dahlias--or, still more\r\noddly, to witness birds of prey which love to career in the storm\r\nsurrounded by monthly roses. Had it been possible to have given each class\r\nof bird and animal its appropriate vegetation, it would doubtless have\r\nbeen preferable; but such an arrangement was manifestly impossible.\r\n\r\nDescending from this general survey, the long row of dens which run below\r\nthe terrace on either side are the first to attract the visitor's\r\nattention. Before this terrace was constructed in 1840, the larger\r\ncarnivora were cooped up in what is now the reptile-house. The early dens\r\nof the establishment form a good example of the difficulty Englishmen\r\nexperience in suiting themselves to altered circumstances. On the first\r\nformation of the gardens the society seems to have taken for its model\r\nsome roving menagerie, as many of the houses of the beasts were nothing\r\nbetter than caravans dismounted from their wheels, and the managers\r\nencamped their collection in a fashion little more permanent than Wombwell\r\nwould have done upon a village green. It was speedily found that the\r\nhealth of the felidæ suffered materially from their close confinement,\r\nwhich did not even admit of the change of air experienced in the\r\ntravelling caravan. In fact, the lions, tigers, leopards, and pumas, did\r\nnot live on an average more than twenty-four months. To remedy this state\r\nof things the terrace dens were constructed, and, rushing from one extreme\r\nto the other, tropical animals were left exposed to the full rigour of\r\nwinter. The drifting rain fell upon their hair, and they were exposed in\r\ncold, wet weather to a temperature which even man, who ranges from the\r\ntorrid zone to the arctic circle, could not resist unprotected. The\r\nconsequences were manifested in the increase of inflammatory lung\r\ndiseases, and it is now found necessary to protect the dens by matting and\r\nartificial heat from the extreme cold and damp of the winter months. In\r\nthe summer the exposure suits them admirably, and it must be confessed\r\nthat the tigers look only too fat and comfortable. One of the most\r\ninteresting cages is that which contains a family party, consisting of the\r\nmastiff with the lion and his mate. They were brought up together from\r\ncub-hood, and agree to a marvel; though the dog would prove little more\r\nthan a mouthful for either of his noble-looking companions. Visitors\r\nexpress a vast deal of sympathy for him, and fancy that the lion is only\r\nsaving him up, as the giant did Jack, for a future feast. But their\r\nsympathy, we believe, is thrown away. \"Lion\" has always maintained the\r\nascendancy he assumed when a pup, and any rough handling on the part of\r\nhis huge playfellows is immediately resented by his flying at their noses.\r\nAlthough the dog is allowed to come out of the den every morning, he shows\r\na great disinclination to leave his old friends. It is, however, thought\r\nadvisable to separate them at feeding-time. Both the lion and lioness are\r\nof English birth, and it is singular that out of the great number that\r\nhave been born in the society's garden full fifty per cent. have come into\r\nthe world with cleft palates, and have perished in consequence of not\r\nbeing able to suck. If the keepers were to fill their nostrils with tow,\r\nwe fancy they could accomplish this act, as well at least as children who\r\nare suffering from cold in the head. The male affords us an opportunity of\r\nshowing the difference between the African variety to which he belongs and\r\nthe East Indian specimen at the other end of the terrace. Our young Cape\r\nfriend has a fine mane, and a tail but slightly bushed at the top, which\r\ndroops towards the ground. The full-grown animal from Goojerat, is, on the\r\ncontrary, comparatively maneless, and his tail takes a short curl upwards\r\nat the end. The caudal extremity of both is furnished with a rudimentary\r\nclaw. This little appendage was supposed by the ancients to be\r\ninstrumental in lashing the lion into fury, and Mr. Gordon Cumming informs\r\nus that the natives of South Africa believe it to be the residence of an\r\nevil spirit which never evacuates its post until death overtakes the beast\r\nand gives it notice to quit. The Goojerat or maneless lion is supposed to\r\nbe the original of the heraldic beast we regard with such respect as a\r\nnational emblem, but which foreigners maintain is nothing better than a\r\nleopard.\r\n\r\nBut why do we coop these noble animals in such nutshells of cages? What a\r\nmiserable sight to see them pace backwards and forwards in their box-like\r\ndens! Why should they, of all the beasts of the forest, be condemned to\r\nsuch imprisonment? The bear has his pole, the deer his paddock, the otter\r\nhis pool, where at least they have enough liberty to keep them in health;\r\nbut we stall our lions and tigers as we would oxen, till they grow\r\nlethargic, fat, and puffy, like city aldermen. With half an acre of\r\nenclosed ground, strewn with sand, we might see the king of beasts pace\r\nfreely, as in his Libyan fastness, and with twenty feet of artificial\r\nrock, might witness the tiger's bound. Such an arrangement would, we are\r\nconvinced, attract thousands to the gardens, and restore to the larger\r\ncarnivora that place among the beasts from which they have here been so\r\nunfairly degraded. We commend this idea to the able secretary to the\r\nsociety, who has shown, by his system of \"starring,\" how alive he is to\r\nthe fact that it is to the sixpenny and shilling visitors who flock to the\r\ngardens by tens of thousands on holidays that he must look to support the\r\nwise and liberal expenditure he has lately adopted.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the terrace, in addition to the leopards and hyænas,\r\nis to be found a splendid collection of bears, from the sharp-muzzled\r\nsun-bear (who robs a beehive in a hollow tree as artistically as a London\r\nthief cuts a purse) to the enormous Russian Bruin, the largest perhaps\r\never exhibited. \"Prince Menschikoff,\"[8] as he is called by the keepers,\r\ngrew into exceeding good condition in the gardens at Hull, where it\r\nappears he chiefly dieted upon his brethren, the cannibal having consumed\r\nno less than five bears; and they appear to have had the same effect upon\r\nhim as cod-liver oil upon a human invalid. His neighbours, the white Polar\r\nbears, contrast with him strangely in physiognomy and form; their heads,\r\nsharp as polecats', seem fashioned, like cutwaters, to enable them to make\r\ntheir way in the sea; and if they would lift their huge paws, we should\r\nsee that they were clothed almost entirely with hair, to aid them in\r\nsecuring a firm footing on the ice. The largest of these beasts managed to\r\nget out of his inclosure before the top of it was barred in; but he was\r\npeaceably led back again. Indeed, even the wildest of the beasts, after a\r\nlittle confinement, seem so frightened at recovering their liberty, that\r\nthey easily allow themselves to be recaptured.\r\n\r\nIn one year the Felidæ alone consumed beef, mutton, and horseflesh to the\r\nvalue of £1,367. 19_s._ 5_d._ This sum is entirely irrespective of the\r\nfish, snakes, frogs, and other \"small deer\" given to the birds and\r\ninferior carnivora. They all live here like gentlemen, emancipated from\r\nthe drudgery of finding their daily food. They have their slaughter-houses\r\nclose at hand in the gardens, where sheep, oxen, and horses are weekly\r\nkilled expressly for them. Some of them will only eat cooked meat. Soon\r\nafter the establishment of the gardens experiments were made as to the\r\nbest manner of feeding them, which proved that while they gained flesh and\r\ncontinued active upon one full meal a day, they lost weight and became\r\ndrowsy on two half-meals. In the endeavour to follow nature still closer,\r\nthey were dieted more sparely, and even fasted at certain seasons. This\r\ntreatment, however, resulted in a catastrophe--a female leopard and puma\r\nkilling and eating their companions: a strong hint for fuller rations,\r\nwhich was not neglected.\r\n\r\nLet us now cross over from the cages of the king of beasts to the aviary\r\nof the king of birds. The collection of eagles, vultures, and condors,\r\nnumbers upwards of twenty species, among which we recognized \"the oldest\r\ninhabitant\" of the Gardens--the vulture presented to the society by Mr.\r\nBrooks, the surgeon, more than thirty years ago. Notwithstanding his age,\r\nhe looks one of the finest birds in the collection. We question, however,\r\nif the last new-comer of the same species will not \"put his bill out,\"\r\narriving as he does from a distant shore to which thousands of anxious\r\nhearts have turned. We allude to the vulture lately sent from the Crimea.\r\nHe was caught near the monastery of Saint George, and the proximity of his\r\nretreat to many a battle-field suggests reflections too painful to dwell\r\nupon. The prominent impression produced in glancing at this aviary is the\r\nperfect isolation which each bird maintains as he crowns the topmost\r\npinnacle of the heap of rocks reared in the centre of his den, where he\r\nperches, motionless as a stone. There seems to be no recognition of\r\nfellow-prisoners--no interchange of either blows or courtesies between the\r\niron netting. Each seems an enduring captive that will not be comforted\r\nor won over to the ways of men. Now and then unsheathing his piercing eye,\r\nwe perceive the huge wings spread, and perchance remembering the callow\r\neaglets in some Alpine eyrie, the bird soars upwards for a moment, beats\r\nhis pinions against the netting, and falls to the earth again with the\r\nignominious flop of a Christmas turkey. It is impossible to contemplate\r\nthese birds without pity, not unmixed with pain. Who can recognize, in the\r\nmotionless bunch of feathers before us, Audubon's magnificent description\r\nof the Bald Eagle as he swoops upon his prey?--\r\n\r\n    \"The next moment the wild trumpet-like sound of a yet distant but\r\n    approaching swan is heard.... Now is the moment to witness a display\r\n    of the eagle's powers. He glides through the air like a falling star,\r\n    and like a flash of lightning comes upon the timorous quarry, which\r\n    now, in agony and despair, seeks, by various manoeuvres, to elude the\r\n    grasp of his cruel talons. It mounts, doubles, and willingly would\r\n    plunge into the stream were it not prevented by the eagle, which, long\r\n    possessed of the knowledge that by such a stratagem the swan might\r\n    escape him, forces it to remain in the air by attempting to strike it\r\n    with its talons from beneath. The hope of escape is soon given up by\r\n    the swan. It has already become much weakened, and its strength fails\r\n    at the sight of the courage and swiftness of its antagonist. Its last\r\n    gasp is about to escape, when the ferocious eagle strikes with his\r\n    talons the under side of his wing, and with unresisted power forces\r\n    the bird to fall in a slanting direction upon the nearest shore.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the romance of the noble bird's mode of obtaining food--here, as\r\nhe marches off with a dead rat in his claw, or a piece of raw beef, we\r\nbehold its prose. But however unpoetical this treatment, it cannot be said\r\nto disagree with him, as fine plumage and good condition prove. Passing on\r\nour way to the monkey-house, the merry otters are seen playing\r\n\"follow-my-leader\" round their rock-house, now plunging headlong in search\r\nof the flat-fish which shines at the bottom of the water--now bringing it\r\nto shore, and crushing flesh, vertebræ, and all.\r\n\r\nThe admirably-arranged but vilely-ventilated monkey-house is always a\r\ngreat source of attraction. The mixture of fun and solemnity, the odd\r\nattitudes and tricks, and the human expression of their countenances, all\r\ntend to attract, and at the same time to repel. Mr. Rogers used to say,\r\nthat visiting them was like going to see one's poor relations; and\r\nwondrous shabby old fellows some of them appear. We have only to look into\r\ntheir faces for a moment to see that they differ from each other as much\r\nas the faces of mankind. There is a large, long-haired, black-faced\r\nrascal, who looks as murderous as a Malay; a little way off we see another\r\nwith great bushy whiskers and shaggy eyebrows (the mona), the very picture\r\nof a successful horse-dealer; a third, with his long nose and keen eye,\r\nhas all the air of a crafty old lawyer. The contemplation of them brings\r\ninvoluntarily to the mind the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. The\r\napes and baboons are indeed purely brutal, and only excite disgust:\r\ntowards the latter the whole company of smaller monkeys express the utmost\r\nhatred--as may be seen when the keeper by way of fun takes one of them out\r\nof his cage and walks him down the room. The whole population rush to the\r\nfront of their cages, and hoot, growl, and chatter at him as only Eastern\r\nCounty shareholders can do when their chairman takes his seat. The\r\nvivacious little capuchin monkeys are evidently the favourites, and bag\r\nmost of the nuts; the brown capuchin appears to be particularly knowing,\r\nas he keeps a big pebble at hand, and when he finds that his teeth are not\r\nequal to the task, he taps the nut with the stone with just sufficient\r\nforce to break the shell without bruising the kernel. We have often seen\r\nthis little fellow take a pinch of snuff, and assiduously rub his own and\r\nhis companion's skin with it, with a full knowledge, no doubt, of the old\r\nrecipe for killing fleas. He will also make use of an onion for a similar\r\npurpose. Among the other quadrumana in this house we find the lemurs,\r\nwhich look more like long-legged weasels than monkeys, and the\r\nbright-faced little marmosets, who cluster inquiringly to the front of\r\ntheir cage looking in their cap-shaped headdress of fur like so many\r\ngossips quizzing you over the window-blinds.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment there is no specimen of either the uran or\r\nchimpanzee in the Gardens, but there have been at least half a dozen\r\nlocated here within the last ten years, one of which, \"Jenny,\" maintained\r\nher health for five years. The damp, cold air of the Gardens at last\r\nbrought on consumption; and the public must remember the poor, wheezing,\r\ndying brute, with a plaster on her chest and blankets around her, the very\r\npicture of a moribund old man. The only specimen now in Europe is in the\r\nJardin des Plantes, at Paris. This animal, one of the finest ever seen, is\r\nin excellent health, and promises to maintain it in the bright air of La\r\nBelle France. An accomplished naturalist has kindly furnished us with the\r\nfollowing particulars of this brute, which clearly indicate that he is a\r\nvery Dr. Busby among his fellows:--\r\n\r\n    \"He passed through London on his way to Paris, having landed at\r\n    Plymouth. There were then two female Chims resident in the Gardens in\r\n    the Regent's Park, and the French Chim was allowed to lodge in their\r\n    hotel for a couple of nights. On his appearance both of these young\r\n    ladies uttered cries of recognition, which however evinced more fear\r\n    than anything else. Chim was put into a separate compartment, or room\r\n    with a double grille, to prevent the probable injuries which\r\n    discordant apes will inflict on each other. He had scarcely felt the\r\n    floor under his feet when he began to pay attention to his\r\n    countrywomen thus suddenly and unexpectedly found. Their fear and\r\n    surprise gradually subsided, and they stood watching him attentively,\r\n    when he broke out into a characteristic _pas seul_, which he kept up\r\n    for a considerable time, uttering cries scarcely more hideous than\r\n    seem the notes of a Chinese singer, and not far out of unison with his\r\n    loudly-beating feet. The owner, who was present, said that he was\r\n    imitating a dance of the negroes, which the animal had often seen\r\n    while resident in his house in Africa. The animal was upwards of a\r\n    year and a half old, and had spent one year of his life in this\r\n    gentleman's house. The Chim maidens gradually relaxed their reserve as\r\n    the vivacity of the dance increased, until at last, when it was over,\r\n    each stealthily put a hand through the grille and welcomed their\r\n    friend and brother to their home in a far land. As the weather was\r\n    severe--it was early in December--it is possible that their talk was\r\n    of their native palm-groves and their never-ending summer. Chim\r\n    thenceforth made himself as agreeable as possible, and when the time\r\n    for his departure came, the maidens exhibited the liveliest regret,\r\n    short of tears, at losing him. At Paris he increased rapidly in\r\n    stature and intelligence. The climate, diet (he drinks his pint of\r\n    Bordeaux daily), and lively society of the French seem to be more\r\n    congenial to Chim's physique than our melancholy London. He makes\r\n    acquaintance not only with the staff but with the _habitués_ of the\r\n    Garden. The last time I saw him (May, 1854) he came out to taste the\r\n    morning air in the large circular enclosure in front of the Palais des\r\n    Singes, which was built for \"our poor relations\" by M. Thiers. Here\r\n    Chim began his day by a leisurely promenade, casting pleased and\r\n    thankful glances towards the sun, the beautiful sun of early summer.\r\n    He had three satellites, coati-mundis, either by chance or to amuse\r\n    him, and while making all manner of eyes at a young lady who supplies\r\n    the Singerie with pastry and cakes, one of the coati-mundis came up\r\n    stealthily behind and dealt him a small but malicious bite. Chim\r\n    looked round with astonishment at this audacious outrage on his\r\n    person, put his hand haughtily upon the wound, but without losing his\r\n    temper in the least. He walked deliberately to the other side of the\r\n    circle, and fetched a cane which he had dropped there in his\r\n    promenade. He returned with majestic wrath upon his brow, mingled, I\r\n    thought, with contempt; and, taking Coati by the tail, commenced\r\n    punishment with his cane, administering such blows as his victim could\r\n    bear without permanent injury, and applied with equal justice to the\r\n    ribs on either side, in a direction always parallel to the spine.\r\n    When he thought enough had been done, he disposed of Coati without\r\n    moving a muscle of his countenance, by a left-handed jerk, which threw\r\n    the delinquent high in air, head over heels. He came down a sadder and\r\n    a better coati, and retired with shame and fear to an outer corner.\r\n    Having executed this act of justice, Chim betook him to a tree. A\r\n    large baboon, who had in the mean time made his appearance in the\r\n    circle, thought this was a good opportunity of doing a civil thing,\r\n    and accordingly mounted the tree and sat down smilingly, as baboons\r\n    smile, upon the next fork. Chim slowly turned his head at this attempt\r\n    at familiarity, measured the distance, raised his hind foot, and, as\r\n    composedly as he had caned the coati, kicked the big baboon off his\r\n    perch into the arena below. This abasement seemed to do the baboon\r\n    good, for he also retired like the coati, and took up his station on\r\n    the other side. To what perfection of manners and development of\r\n    thought the last year and a half may have brought him I can scarcely\r\n    guess; but one day doubtless some one will say of him, as an Oriental\r\n    prince once said to me, after looking at the uran 'Peter,'--'Does he\r\n    speak English yet?'\"\r\n\r\nThe monkeys before they were transferred to this house suffered a great\r\nmortality, and indeed, on taking possession of their new apartment, the\r\nkeepers used to remove the dead by the barrowful in the morning. This\r\nextreme mortality was produced by want of ventilation, and a system of\r\nheating which burnt the air and induced inflammation of the lungs. Dr.\r\nMarshall Hall and Dr. Arnott, upon being consulted, directed the\r\nsubstitution of an open stove, when the deaths ceased.\r\n\r\nAs we pass towards the small building once used as the parrot-house, but\r\nnow dedicated to the smaller felidæ, we go by the seal-pond, and see that\r\nstrange beast which resembles a Danish carriage-dog with his legs\r\namputated. He is an epicure as regards his regular meals, and turns up his\r\nnose at any fish less _recherché_ than whiting, of which expensive\r\ndelicacy he consumes ten pounds weight daily. Meanwhile, however, he is \"a\r\nsnapper-up of unconsidered trifles,\" and we see him, as the visitors\r\ncirculate round his enclosure, flop, flop, around the margin of his pond,\r\nkeeping a sharp look-out above the railings for stray favours. The house\r\nof the smaller carnivora is generally overlooked, but it is worthy of a\r\nvisit, if only to see the beautiful clouded tigers as they are misnamed,\r\nfor they more resemble hunting leopards both in size and skin-markings.\r\nThese elegant creatures are quite tame, and permit the utmost\r\nfamiliarities of their keeper; but their neighbour, the caracal or lynx,\r\nnever seems tired of making the most ferocious rushes at the bars,\r\naccompanied by a vindictive and incessant spitting, which impresses us\r\nwith the idea that it possesses the very quintessence of catlike nature.\r\nThere is one little cage in this apartment which is deserving of especial\r\ninspection--that containing a specimen of the indigenous black rat, which,\r\naccording to Mr. Waterton, was entirely eaten out of the country by the\r\ngrey rats of Hanover, which came over in the same ship with _Dutch\r\nWilliam_, and which are, according to that hearty naturalist, the very\r\nemblems of \"Protestant rapacity.\" Those who have read his delightful\r\nessays know well with what perseverance the author hunts the grey rodent\r\nthrough every chapter of his book.\r\n\r\nIf we now retrace our steps along the border of the plantation, which\r\nforms a deep green background for countless dahlias, and moreover screens\r\nthe garden from the biting east, we shall, by turning to the right hand,\r\ncome upon the Aquarium, the latest and most attractive sight in the\r\ngardens. How cool and delicious! Around us we perceive slices of the deep\r\nsea-bed and the rapid river. Were we mermen we could not examine more at\r\nease the rich pavement of the ocean set with strange and living flowers.\r\nIn the midst of the green walls of water which surround us, mimic caves,\r\nwaving with sea-weed and other marine plants, afford shelter and\r\nlurking-holes for bright fish which stare and dart, or for shambling\r\ncrustaceæ which creep over the pebbly bottom. Against the dark verdure of\r\nthese submerged rocks, the sea-anemone rears its orange base tipped with\r\nflower-like fans, or hangs its snake-like tentacles, writhing as the\r\nhead-dress of Medusa. But we must look narrowly into each nook and under\r\nevery stone, if we wish to realize the amount of animal life, which here\r\nputs on such strange vegetable forms. Let us consider well for a few\r\nminutes one of the tanks running down the middle of the building. For\r\nmonths all the minute animal and vegetable life has been multiplying and\r\ndecaying, and yet the water remains pure and bright. The explanation of\r\nthis phenomenon affords one of the most beautiful examples of the manner\r\nin which nature on a grand scale holds the balance true between her\r\npowers. If we were to put these little bright-eyed fish alive into the\r\ncrystal tank, in a week's time they would die, because they would have\r\nwithdrawn all the oxygen it originally contained, and contaminated it with\r\nthe poisonous carbonic acid gas exhaled from their lungs. To prevent this,\r\nthe philosopher hangs these mimic caves with verdant seaweed, and plants\r\nthe bottom with graceful marine grasses. If the spectator looks narrowly\r\nat the latter, he finds them fringed with bright silver bells: these bells\r\ncontain oxygen, which the plants have eliminated from their tissues under\r\nthe action of light, having previously consumed the carbonic acid gas\r\nthrown out by the fishes and zoophytes. Thus plants and animals are\r\nindispensable to the preservation of each other's life. But even now we\r\nhave not told the entire causes which produce the crystal clearness of the\r\nwater. The vegetable element grows too fast, and if left to itself the\r\nsides of the tank would be covered with a confervoid growth, which would\r\nspeedily obscure its inmates from our view.\r\n\r\nWe want scavengers to clear away the superfluous vegetation, and we find\r\nthem in the periwinkles which we see attached by their foot-stalk to the\r\nglass. These little mollusca do their work well: Mr. Gosse, who has\r\nwatched them feeding with a pocket-glass, perceived that their saw-like\r\ntongues moved backwards and forwards with a crescentic motion, and thus,\r\nas the animal advances, he leaves a slight swathe-like mark upon the\r\nglass, as the mower does upon the field. But it is clear that there are\r\nnot enough labourers in the tank we are inspecting to accomplish their\r\ntask, as the lobster, who comes straggling over the stones in such an\r\nungainly manner, is more like a moving salad than any living thing, so\r\nthickly are back, tail, feelers, and claws, infested with a dense\r\nvegetable growth. A few more black mowers are imperatively called for. The\r\nfish, the weed, and the mollusc having secured to us a clear view of the\r\ninhabitants of the tank, let us inspect them one by one. Here we see the\r\nparasitic anemone. Like the old man of the sea, it fixes itself upon some\r\npoor Sinbad in the shape of a whelk, and rides about at its ease in search\r\nof food. Another interesting variety of this zoophyte is the plumose\r\nsea-anemone, a more stay-at-home animal, which generally fixes itself upon\r\na flat rock or an oyster-shell, and waits for the food to come to it, as\r\nyour London housewife expects the butcher and baker to call in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe pure white body of the neighbouring actinia renders it more\r\nobservable. Its tentacles, displayed in plumes over the central mouth,\r\nwhich is marked with yellow, give it the exact appearance of a\r\nchrysanthemum, and should be much in favour with the mermaids to adorn\r\ntheir hair. A still more extraordinary creature is the _Tabella\r\nventilabrum_. The tube of this strange animal is perfectly straight, and\r\nits large brown silk-like radiating fans, whilst in search of food,\r\nrevolve just as the old-fashioned whirling ventilators did in our windows.\r\nThe instant this fan is touched it is retracted into the tube, the ends\r\njust appearing outside, and giving it the appearance of a camel's-hair\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to describe the different species of zoophytes and\r\nannelides, amounting to hundreds--indeed, they are not all familiar to\r\nscientific men. We have little more to say of the crustacea that go\r\nscrambling about, yet it would be impossible to overlook that peripatetic\r\nwhelk-shell, which climbs about the stones with such marvellous activity.\r\nOn a narrower inspection we perceive that it moves by a foreign agency.\r\nThose sprawling legs protruding from its mouth discover the hermit crab,\r\nwhich is obliged to dress its soft body in the first defensible armour it\r\ncan pick up. A deserted whelk or common spiral shell is its favourite\r\nresort, but, like many bipeds, it has a love of changing its house; and\r\nthose who have narrowly watched its habits state that it will deliberately\r\nturn over the empty shells upon the beach, and, after examining them\r\ncarefully with its claws, pop its body out of one habitation into another,\r\nin order to obtain the best possible fit. But there are still stranger\r\nfacts connected with this intelligent little crustacean. We have before\r\nobserved that the parasitic sea-anemone invariably fixes itself when\r\npossible upon this movable house, perfectly regardless of the many bumps\r\nand rubs which necessarily fall to its lot. Another warm friend, the\r\ncloak-anemone, clings still closer, for it perfectly envelopes the lip of\r\nthe shell with its living mantle. Our hermit has still a third intimate\r\nacquaintance, who sponges upon him for bed and board, in the shape of a\r\nbeautiful worm, _Nereis bilineata_, which stows itself behind the crab in\r\nthe attic of the whelk-shell, and, the moment its protector by his motions\r\nindicates that he has procured food, glides between the two left-foot\r\njaws, and drags a portion of the morsel from his mouth, the crab appearing\r\nto evince no more animosity at the seizure than the Quaker who suddenly\r\nfinds his spoons taken for church-rates. The interesting specimens we have\r\ndwelt upon are confined to the sea-water tanks, which line the Aquarium on\r\nthe side opposite the door, and those which run down the centre of the\r\napartment. _Vis-à-vis_ are the fresh-water tanks, in which we may watch\r\nthe habits of British fishes. There is a noble pike lying as still as a\r\nstone--a model sitter for the photographer who lately took his portrait.\r\nThe barbel, bream, dace, and gudgeon are seen going about their daily\r\nduties as though they were at the bottom of the Thames, instead of\r\nsandwiched between two panes of glass, and inspected on either side by\r\ncurious eyes. Those who go early in the morning will have a chance of\r\nseeing the lampreys hanging like leeches from the glass by their circular\r\nmouths, and breathing by the seven holes which run beside their pectoral\r\nfins. The marine fish should also be studied; strange forms with\r\nvicious-looking jaws, the dog-fish for example, which is a young fry as\r\nyet, but which will grow a yard or two in length.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the building the alligators' pool discovers here and\r\nthere a floating reptile's head, the outline of which reminds us of the\r\nhippopotamus. In both cases the habit of resting in the water with the\r\nhead and body almost entirely submerged necessitates a raised form of the\r\nnostril and eyesocket, in order to allow the animal to see and breathe. A\r\nsimilar formation of the face is observable in the wart hog (in another\r\nportion of the gardens), which wallows up to its eyes in slush and mire.\r\nThe alligators have the tank to themselves, with the exception of a\r\ncouple of turtles, which are too hard nuts for even them to crack.\r\n\r\nThe council has only established the aquarium a few years, and already it\r\nis well stocked with specimens of British zoophytes and annelides, for the\r\nmost part dredged from the neighbourhood of Weymouth. If these are so\r\nbeautiful, what must be the wonders of the deep sea in tropical climates?\r\nWho knows what strange things a bold adventurer might pick up who, like\r\nSchiller's diver, would penetrate the horrid depths of the whirlpool, not\r\nfor the jewelled cup of the monarch, but for the hidden living treasures\r\nnature has planted there? Doubtless, among the rusty anchors and\r\nweed-clung ribs of long-lost armadas, there nestle gigantic zoophytes and\r\nenormous starfish, which would make the fortune of the Gardens in a single\r\nseason. At all events, we hope to see the aquarium greatly extended, as it\r\nwill afford the means of studying a department of natural history of which\r\nwe have hitherto been almost wholly in the dark.\r\n\r\nIf we pursue our walk down the broad path which skirts the paddocks\r\nenclosing the deer and llamas, we cannot help being struck with the fact\r\nthat the finest half of the gardens--that which is open to the setting\r\nsun--is not yet built on, whilst the more exposed portion is\r\ninconveniently crowded. The reason is, that the Commissioners of the Woods\r\nand Forests will not allow any permanent buildings to be erected on these\r\nparts, for what cause we cannot tell. We trust the prohibition will be\r\nwithdrawn, and that we shall see constructed here an enclosed\r\nexercising-ground for the poor confined inhabitants of the terrace-dens.\r\nAt the northern extremity of the path we have been following we come upon\r\nthe paddock and pool dedicated to cranes and storks. What spectre birds\r\nhave we got among? See yonder, on the very edge of the pool, the gaunt\r\nadjutant, his head muffled up in his shoulders, looking like some\r\ntraveller attempting to keep his nose warm in the east wind. They say\r\nevery man has his likeness among the lower animals, and we have seen\r\nplenty of adjutants waiting on a winter's night for the last omnibus. What\r\nan elegant gentleman seems the Stanley crane beside him! There is as much\r\ndifference between the two as between a young guardsman in full dress at\r\nthe opera and the night cabman huddled up in the multitudinous capes of\r\nhis great-coat. A third claimant for our admiration steps forward like a\r\ndancing-master, now bending low, now with the aid of his wings lifting\r\nhimself on the light fantastic toe, now advancing, now poussetting, and\r\nall the time calling attention to his grotesque but not altogether\r\ninelegant attitudes by a peculiar cry. We defy the gravest spectator to\r\nwatch the beautiful crowned crane at his antics without laughing. But we\r\nhear the lady beside us exclaiming, \"Is it possible that the Maraboo\r\nfeathers which so often gracefully sway in obeisance before the queen,\r\nwere ever portions of such ugly birds as these?\" Unlikely as it may seem,\r\nit is verily from these dirty ill-favoured looking Maraboo storks that\r\nthis fashionable plumage is procured. Close by, sitting upon a stone, we\r\nsee the melancholy-looking heron, and the audacious sparrows hop within a\r\nfoot of his legs, so inanimate he seems. Ah! it is the vile deceit of the\r\nbird: in an instant he has stricken the intruder with his bill, and the\r\nnext the sparrow has disappeared down his throat. That elegant grey crane\r\nis the \"native companion\" from Australia, so called from his love of\r\nconsorting with man in that country. We all know what familiars cranes and\r\nstorks are in Holland and the East, where they build on the chimney-pots\r\nwithout the slightest fear; and we are glad to find that they possess the\r\nsame confidence in the savages of the New World. They are handsome birds,\r\nbut not richly plumed as the European crane, with his black and white\r\nfeathers and full-clustered tail. Once these cranes were common here, when\r\n\"England was merrie England;\" that is, before windmills and steam-engines\r\nwere set to work to rescue many counties from a state of marsh. With\r\ncivilization they utterly disappeared from the land, and with civilization\r\nwe once more find them amongst us--a sight to gaze at. Not long since the\r\nodd population of this paddock embraced a secretary-bird, whose velvet\r\nbreeches, white stockings, and reserved air gave him an official\r\nappearance worthy of Somerset House in the last century. Take care, little\r\ngirl, how you feed them; a charge with fixed bayonets is scarcely more\r\nformidable than the rush of sharp long bills through the railings which\r\nimmediately follows a display of provisions.\r\n\r\nA few steps take us to the magnificent aviary, 170 feet in length,\r\nconstructed in 1851, through the nineteen divisions of which a pure stream\r\nof water is constantly flowing, and the space enclosed by iron netting is\r\nso spacious that the birds have room freely to use their wings. The first\r\ncompartment contains two of the rarities of the gardens--the satin\r\nbower-bird and the Tallagulla or brush-turkey. The former, a bird of a\r\nshining blue-black colour, is the only remaining one of three brought to\r\nthis country in 1849. Immediately upon their arriving in the gardens they\r\ncommenced the construction of one of their bowers or \"runs,\" which,\r\naccording to the secretary, has been constantly added to and re-arranged\r\nfrom that period to the present time. The bower is, perhaps, one of the\r\nmost extraordinary things in bird-architecture, as it is constructed not\r\nfor the useful purpose of containing the young, but purely as a\r\nplaying-place--a decorated ball-room, in fact, wherein the young couple\r\nflirt and make love previous to entering upon connubial life. The bower is\r\nconstructed, in the present instance, from the twigs of an old besom, in\r\nthe shape of a horse-shoe; or perhaps we should convey a better idea of it\r\nby stating that the sticks are bent into a shape like the ribs of a\r\nman-of-war, the top being open, and the length varying from six to twelve\r\ninches. Against the sides, and at the entrance of the bower, the bird, in\r\na state of nature, places bright feathers, snail-shells, bleached\r\nbones--anything, in fact, containing colour. When it is remembered that\r\nAustralia is the very paradise of parrots and gaudy-plumaged birds, it\r\nwill be seen that the little artist cannot lack materials to satisfy his\r\ntaste for ornament; nevertheless, we are told he goes for a considerable\r\ndistance for some of his decorations. When the structure is completed, he\r\nsits in it to entice the female, fully aware, no doubt, that the fair are\r\nattracted by a handsome establishment. Be that as it may, the couple\r\nspeedily commence running in and out of it, with as much sense, and\r\nprobably with as much enjoyment, as light-heeled bipeds perform a galop.\r\nThe consequence, however, of the male bird being bereft of his\r\ncompanions, he seems careless of his bower, which is in a most forlorn\r\ncondition--a ball-room, in fact, a day after a _fête_. May a new companion\r\nspeedily arrive and induce him to put his house once more in order! The\r\nsatin bower-bird, like the magpie, is well-known by the natives to be a\r\nterrible thief; and they always search his abode for any object they may\r\nhave lost. \"I myself,\" says Mr. Gould, in his account of these birds,\r\n\"found at the entrance of one of them a small neatly-worked stone tomahawk\r\nof an inch and a half in length, together with some slips of blue cotton\r\nrags, which the birds had, doubtless, picked up at a deserted encampment\r\nof the natives.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely a less interesting bird is the brush-turkey. In appearance it is\r\nvery like the common black turkey, but is not quite so large; the\r\nextraordinary manner in which its eggs are hatched constitutes its\r\nsingularity. It makes no nest, in the usual acceptation of the term, but\r\nscratches decayed vegetable matter into a pyramid with its feet. It then\r\ncarefully dibbles in its eggs at regular intervals, with the small end\r\ndownward, and covers them over with the warm fermenting gatherings. The\r\npair in the gardens, shortly after they were received from Australia,\r\ncommenced making one of these hatching-mounds, which, by the time it was\r\nfinished, contained upwards of four cart-loads of leaves and other\r\nvegetable matter. After the female had deposited sixteen eggs, each\r\nmeasuring not less than four inches in length--an enormous size,\r\nconsidering the bulk of the bird--the male began to keep watch over this\r\nnatural Eccaleobion, and every now and then scratched away the rubbish to\r\ninspect them. After six weeks of burial, the eggs, in succession, and\r\nwithout any warning, gave up their chicks--not feeble, but full-fledged\r\nand strong: an intelligent keeper told us that he had seen one fly up out\r\nof the ground at least five feet high. At night the chicks scraped holes\r\nfor themselves, and, lying down therein, were covered over by the old\r\nbirds, and thus remained until morning. The extraordinary strength of the\r\nnewly-hatched bird is accounted for by the size of the shell, which\r\ncontains sufficient nutriment to nourish it until it is lusty.\r\nUnfortunately, all the young but one have perished through various\r\naccidents quite independently of temperature; and the next brood will\r\nprobably be reared. As both the flesh and the eggs of these birds are\r\ndelicious, the council is anxious to naturalize them among us. In fact,\r\none of the objects of the gardens, under their enlightened management, is\r\nto make it what Bacon calls in his \"Atlantis,\" \"a tryal place for beasts\r\nand fishes.\" For centuries a system of extermination has been adopted\r\ntowards many indigenous animals; the wolf and buzzard have quite\r\ndisappeared, and the eagle is fast being swept away even from the\r\nhighlands of Scotland--so rapidly, indeed, that Mr. Gordon Cumming is\r\nanxious, we hear, for the formation of a society for the protection of its\r\neggs. Noxious animals have been replaced by the acclimatization of many of\r\nthe foreign fauna, which are either distinguished for their beauty or\r\nvaluable for their flesh. This transfer, which adds so much to the\r\nrichness of the country, can be vastly accelerated through the agency of\r\nthese gardens, which are a kind of \"tryal ground\" for beasts, as the\r\nfields of some of our rich agriculturists are for foreign roots and\r\ngrasses, in which those likely to be of service can be discovered, and\r\nafterwards distributed throughout the land.\r\n\r\nIf we may quote the brush-turkeys as instances of birds capable of\r\naffording a new kind of delicate and easily-reared food, the splendid\r\nImpegan pheasants, close at hand, bred here from a pair belonging to her\r\nMajesty, and which endure, in the open air, the rigour of winter, may be\r\nlooked upon as \"things of beauty,\" which may be produced among us to charm\r\nthe eye. The elands, again, on the north side of the garden, which have\r\nbred so prolifically, and made flesh so rapidly, have been with advantage\r\nturned out into our parks, where their beautiful forms prove as attractive\r\nto the eye as their venison, of the finest quality, do to the taste.\r\n\r\nBut we can no longer tarry to speculate further on the riches of this\r\naviary, which contains rare specimens of birds from all parts of the\r\nworld. Passing along the path which takes us by the north entrance, we\r\nreach the pelicans' paddock, in which we see half a dozen of these\r\nungainly creatures, white and grey, with pouches beneath their bills as\r\ncapacious as the bag of a lady's work-table. The visitor may sometimes\r\nhave an opportunity of witnessing an explanation of the popular myth that\r\nthe old bird feeds its young from the blood of its own breast. This idea\r\nevidently arose from the fact that it can only empty the contents of its\r\npouch into the mouths of its young by pressing it against its breast, in\r\nthe act of doing which the feathers often became insanguined from the\r\nblood of the mangled fish within it. The close observance of birds and\r\nbeasts in zoological collections has tended to reduce many fabulous tales\r\nto sober reason. On the other side of the walk may be seen in immature\r\nplumage one of the red flamingoes from South America, which are said to\r\nsimulate so closely a regiment of our soldiers, as they stand in rows\r\nfishing beside the banks of rivers; and here, too, are the delicate\r\nrose-colour specimens of the Mediterranean, which are likewise exceedingly\r\nbeautiful. Those accustomed to navigate the Red Sea frequently witness\r\nvast flights of these birds passing and re-passing from Arabia to Egypt;\r\nand we are informed by a traveller that on one occasion, when he had a\r\ngood opportunity of measuring the column, he convinced himself that it was\r\nupwards of a mile in length! What a splendid spectacle to see the pure\r\neastern sky barred by this moving streak of brilliant colour!\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet explored the north side of the grounds, where the huge\r\npachydermatous animals are lodged. The difficulty caused by the\r\ncarriage-drive running between the two gardens has been vanquished by\r\nmeans of the tunnel, the ascent from which on the opposite side, flanked\r\nas it is with graceful ferns, is one of the most charming portions of the\r\ngrounds on a hot summer's day. If after passing through the subterranean\r\npassage we turn to the right, we come immediately upon the reptile-house.\r\nUnless the visitor selects his time, he will generally find little to\r\namuse him here. The great snakes have either retired from public life\r\nunder their blankets, or lie coiled upon the branches of trees in their\r\ndens. The reptiles are offered food once a week, but will not always feed\r\nat this interval. One huge python fasted the almost incredible time of\r\ntwenty-two months, having probably prepared himself for his abstinence by\r\na splendid gorge. After a fast of seven days, however, the majority of the\r\nserpents regain their appetites. Three o'clock is the feeding-time, and\r\nthe reptiles which are on the look-out seem to know full well the errand\r\nof the man who enters with the basket, against the side of which they hear\r\nthe fluttering wings of the feathered victims and the short stamp of the\r\ndoomed rabbits. The keeper opens the door at the back of the den of the\r\nvoluminous serpents on our right--for of these there is no fear,--takes\r\noff their blanket, and drops in upon the clattering pebbles a scampering\r\nrabbit, who hops from side to side, curious to inspect his new habitation;\r\npresently, satisfied, he sits on his haunches and leisurely begins to wash\r\nhis face. Silently the rock-snake glides over the stones, uncurling his\r\nhuge folds, which, like a cable, seem to move as though by some agency\r\nfrom without, looks for an instant upon his unconscious victim, and the\r\nnext has seized him with his cruel jaws. His constricting folds are\r\ntwisted as swiftly as a whip-lash round his shrieking prey, and for ten\r\nminutes the serpent lies still, maintaining his mortal knot until his prey\r\nis dead, when, seizing him by the ears, he draws him through his vice-like\r\ngrip, crushing every bone, and elongating the body preparatory to\r\ndevouring it. The boa and the rock-snake always swallow their prey head\r\nforemost. How is that fine neck and delicate head to make room for that\r\nbulky rabbit? thinks the spectator. Presently he sees the jaws gape, and\r\nslowly the reptile _draws himself over_, rather than swallows, his prey,\r\nas you draw a stocking upon your leg. The huge lump descends lower and\r\nlower beneath the speckled scales, which seem to stare with distension,\r\nand the monster coils himself up once more to digest his meal in quiet.\r\nRabbits and pigeons form the food of the pythons in these gardens. While\r\nthe smaller birds are preyed upon in the reptile-house, their big\r\nbrothers, the storks in the paddock, are reciprocating the law of nature\r\nby eating snakes. As we pass to the opposite side of the serpent-room,\r\nwhere the venomous kinds are kept, we perceive that a more cautious\r\narrangement is made for feeding. The door opens at the top instead of at\r\nthe sides of their dens, and with good reason; for no sooner does the\r\nkeeper remove with a crooked iron rod the blanket from the cobra, than the\r\nreptile springs, with inflated hood, into an S-like attitude, and darts\r\nlaterally at his enemy. He seems incapable of striking well any object\r\nabove or below his level: watch, for instance, that guinea-pig: again and\r\nagain he dashes at it, but misses his aim; now he hits it, but only to\r\ndrive the poor frightened creature with a score of flying pebbles before\r\nhim: when at last he succeeds in piercing the sides of his victim, tetanic\r\nspasms immediately commence, and it dies convulsed in a few seconds. It is\r\nsaid by those who have watched venomous snakes, that the manner of dying\r\nexhibited by their stricken prey discloses the nature of the reptile that\r\ninflicted the poisoned wound. It is scarcely necessary to state that the\r\npopular idea that the tongue darts forth the venom is a fallacy. The\r\npoison is contained in glands which lie at the root of the fangs on either\r\nside, and, by the compression of the powerful muscles which make the head\r\nappear so broad and flat, it is forced into the fine tube which runs at\r\nthe sides of the fang, and finds its exit near the point by a minute\r\nopening. The cobra at present in the collection, with its skin a glossy\r\nblack and yellow, its eye black and angry, its motions agile and graceful,\r\nseems to be the very personification of India. As we watch it when ready\r\nto spring, we suddenly remember that only a film of glass stands between\r\nus and \"pure death.\" But there is nothing to fear: the python, in the\r\nadjoining room, which weighs a hundred and twenty pounds, being incensed\r\non his first arrival at being removed from his box, darted with all his\r\nforce at a spectator. Yet the pane of glass had strength enough to bring\r\nhim up, and he fell back so bruised about the head and muzzle by the\r\ncollision, that he could not feed well for several months. The cobra that\r\nwe see is the same that destroyed its keeper. In a fit of drunkenness, the\r\nman, against express orders, took the reptile out, and, placing its head\r\ninside his waistcoat, allowed it to glide round his body. When it had\r\nemerged from under his clothes from the other side, apparently in good\r\nhumour, he squeezed its tail, when it struck him between his eyes; in\r\ntwenty minutes his consciousness was gone, and in less than three hours he\r\nwas dead. Before we leave this reptile-room, let us peep for a moment into\r\nthe little apartment opening from the corner, where, hanging from the\r\nwall, we see all the cast-off dresses of the serpents. If the keeper will\r\nallow us to handle one of them for a moment, we shall see that it is\r\nindeed an entire suit of light-brown colour and of gauzy texture, which\r\ncovered not only the body and head, but the very eyeballs of the wearer.\r\n\r\nThe Python-house on the other side of the Museum contains two enormous\r\nserpents. The adventures of one of them--the _Python reticulatus_--deserve\r\nto be written: when small enough to be placed in the pocket, he was, with\r\na companion now no more, taken from Ceylon to Brazil by American sailors;\r\nthey were then exhibited in most of the maritime towns of South America,\r\nand were publicly sold for a high price at Callao to the captain of a\r\nship, who brought them to the gardens, and demanded £600 for the pair;\r\nfully persuaded of their enormous value, he had paid £30 to insure them on\r\nthe voyage, and it was not until he had long and painfully cogitated that\r\nhe agreed to sell them for £40. We have before referred to the\r\nextraordinary length of time a python has been known to fast without\r\ninjury. Their fancies as well as their fastings are rather eccentric.\r\nEvery one has heard of the snake which swallowed his blanket, a meal which\r\nultimately killed him. A python who had lived for years in a friendly\r\nmanner with a brother nearly as large as himself, was found one morning\r\nsolus. As the cage was secure, the keepers were puzzled to know how the\r\nserpent had escaped: at last it was observed that the remaining inmate had\r\nswollen remarkably during the night, when the horrid fact became plain\r\nenough; the fratricide had succeeded in swallowing the entire person of\r\nhis brother; it was his last meal, however, for in some months he died. A\r\nfriend informs us that he once saw in these gardens a rat-snake of Ceylon\r\ndevour a common _Coluber natrix_. The rat-snake, however, had not taken\r\nthe measure of his victim, as by no effort could he dispose of the last\r\nfour inches of his tail, which stuck out rather jauntily from the side of\r\nhis mouth, with very much the look of a cigar. After a quarter of an hour,\r\nthe tail began to exhibit a retrograde motion, and the swallowed snake was\r\ndisgorged, nothing the worse for his living sepulchre, with the exception\r\nof the wound made by his partner when first he seized him. The ant-eater,\r\nwho lately inhabited the room leading out of the python apartment, has\r\ndied of a want of ants.\r\n\r\nAs we issue again into the open air, we have before us the whole length of\r\nthe avenue, arched with lime-trees, in summer a veritable isle of verdure.\r\nWhat a charming picture it used to be to see the docile elephant pacing\r\ntowards us with ponderous and majestic steps, whilst, in the scarlet\r\nhowdha, happy children swayed from side to side as she marched. She, who\r\nwas our delight for so many years, died some time since of a storm of\r\nthunder and lightning. Such indeed was what may seem at first the singular\r\nverdict of the medical man who made his _post mortem_. The terror,\r\nhowever, inspired by the storm appears to have produced some nervous\r\ndisease, under which she succumbed. There is a suspicion that the carcase,\r\nfive thousand pounds and upwards in weight, which was disposed of to the\r\nnackers, ultimately found its way to the sausage-makers. Do not start,\r\ngood reader; elephant's flesh is considered excellent eating by the tribes\r\nof South Africa, and the lion-slayer tells us that the feet are a true\r\ndelicacy. He used to eat them as we do Stilton cheese, scooping out the\r\ninterior and leaving the rind; he exhibited to his audience some of these\r\nrelics, which looked like huge leather fire-buckets. And now we have only\r\nthe young animal left, that once sucked his huge mother, to the delight of\r\nthe crowd of children, and to the disgust of the rhinoceros, who is the\r\nsworn enemy to all elephants. The little one is growing apace, however,\r\nand has already been promoted to carry the long-deserted howdha. The\r\nrhinoceros, close at hand, is the successor of the fine old fellow\r\npurchased in 1836 for 1,050_l._, the largest sum ever given by the society\r\nfor a single animal. The specimen now in the gardens cost only 350_l._ in\r\n1850, so much do these commodities fluctuate in value. His predecessor,\r\nwho departed this life full of years, was constantly forced upon his belly\r\nby a pugnacious elephant, who pressed his tusks upon the back of his\r\nneighbour when he came near the palings which separated their inclosures.\r\nThis rough treatment appears to have led to his death, as Professor Owen\r\nfound, on dissecting the massive brute, which weighed upwards of two tons,\r\nthat the seventh rib had been fractured at the bend near the vertebral\r\nend, and had wounded the left lung.\r\n\r\nNot far from the picturesque house built by Decimus Burton, in one of the\r\ncages fronting the office of the superintendent of the gardens, is to be\r\nseen a beaver. The wonderful instinct of this little animal is certainly\r\nnot inferior to that of the huge elephant. As yet he has not been placed\r\nin circumstances to enable the public to witness his building capacities;\r\nbut it is the intention, we understand, of the Council to give him a\r\nstream of running water and the requisite materials to construct one of\r\nthose extraordinary dams for which this animal is so famous. In Canada,\r\nwhere he used to flourish, the backwoodsmen often came upon hill-sides\r\ncompletely cleared of good-sized trees by colonies of these little\r\ncreatures, who employed the felled timber to construct their dams--dams,\r\nnot of a few feet in length, but sometimes of a hundred and fifty feet,\r\nbuilt according to the best engineering formula for resisting the pressure\r\nof water, namely, in an angle with its apex pointed up the stream, and\r\ngradually narrowing from base to summit. In short, Mr. Brunel himself\r\ncould not outdo your beaver in his engineering operations. Even in\r\nconfinement this sagacious Rodent loves to display his skill, as we may\r\nlearn from Mr. Broderip's account of his pet Binney:--\r\n\r\n    \"Its building instinct,\" says that accomplished naturalist, \"showed\r\n    itself immediately it was let out of its cage, and materials were\r\n    placed in its way, and this before it had been a week in its new\r\n    quarters. Its strength, even before it was half-grown, was great, it\r\n    would drag along a large sweeping-brush, or a warming-pan, grasping\r\n    the handle with its teeth, so that the load came over its shoulder,\r\n    and advancing in an oblique direction till it arrived at the part\r\n    where it wished to place it. The long and large materials were always\r\n    taken first; and two of the longest were generally laid crosswise,\r\n    with one of the ends of each touching the wall, and their other ends\r\n    projecting out into the room. The area caused by the cross-brushes and\r\n    the wall he would fill up with hand-brushes, rush baskets, books,\r\n    boots, sticks, cloths, dried turf, or anything portable. As the work\r\n    grew high, he supported himself on his tail, which propped him up\r\n    admirably; and he would often, after laying on one of his building\r\n    materials, sit up over against it, appearing to consider his work, or,\r\n    as the country people say, 'judge it.' This pause was sometimes\r\n    followed by changing the position of the materials, and sometimes they\r\n    were left in their place. After he had piled up his materials in one\r\n    part of the room (for he generally chose the same place), he proceeded\r\n    to wall up the space between the feet of a chest of drawers which\r\n    stood at a little distance from it, high enough on its legs to make\r\n    the bottom a roof for him, using for this purpose dried turf and\r\n    sticks, which he laid very even, and filling up the interstices with\r\n    bits of coal, hay, cloth, or anything he could pick up; the last place\r\n    he seemed to appropriate for his dwelling, the former work seemed to\r\n    be intended for a dam. When he had walled up the space between the\r\n    feet of the chest of drawers, he proceeded to carry in sticks, cloths,\r\n    hay, cotton, and to make a nest; and when he had done, he would sit up\r\n    under the drawers, and comb himself with the nails of his hind feet.\"\r\n\r\nWell done, Binney! If the beaver in the garden will only work out his\r\nnatural instincts as perfectly, we may expect some amusement. Up to a late\r\nperiod the beaver had become rather a scarce animal, the exigencies of\r\nfashion having nearly exterminated him. When silk hats came in, however,\r\nthe annual slaughter of hundreds of thousands of his race, for the sake of\r\nthe fur, gradually slackened, and now he is beginning to increase in his\r\nnative retreats,--a singular instance this of the fashions of Paris and\r\nLondon affecting the very existence of a prolific race of animals in the\r\nNew World! In the very next compartment is a hare, who for years played\r\nthe tambourine in the streets of the metropolis, but his master, finding\r\nthat his performances did not draw, exchanged him at these gardens for a\r\nmonkey; and now, whilst he eats his greens in peace, poor Jacko, in a red\r\ncloak and a feathered cap, has probably to earn his daily bread by\r\nmimicking humanity on the top of a barrel-organ. But the hippopotamus\r\nsurges into his bath in the inclosure as we pause, and there is a rush of\r\nvisitors to see the mighty brute performing his ablutions. He no longer\r\ngives audience to all the fair and fashionable folks of the town. Alas for\r\nthe greatness of this world! the soldier-crab and the Esop prawn now draw\r\nbetter \"houses.\" Whether or no this desertion has embittered his temper,\r\nwe cannot say, but he has certainly lost his amiability, notwithstanding\r\nthat he still retains the humorous curl-up of the corners of his mouth\r\nwhich Doyle used to hit off so inimitably. At times, indeed, he is\r\nperfectly furious, and his vast strength has necessitated the\r\nreconstruction of his house on a much stronger plan. Those only who have\r\nseen him rush with extended jaws at the massive oaken door of his\r\napartment, returning again and again to the charge, and making the solid\r\nbeams quiver as though they were only of inch-deal, can understand the\r\ndangerous fits which now and then are exhibited by a creature, who was so\r\ngentle, when he made his _début_, that he could not go to sleep without\r\nhaving his Arab keeper's feet to lay his neck upon. This affection for his\r\nnurse has undergone a great change, for, on Hamet's countryman and\r\ncoadjutor, Mohammed, making his second appearance with the young female\r\nhippopotamus, Obaysch very nearly killed him in the violence of his rage.\r\nHe has a peculiar dislike to the sight of working men, especially if they\r\nare employed in doing any jobs about his apartment. The smith of the\r\nestablishment happening one day to be passing along the iron gallery which\r\nruns across one side of his bath, the infuriated animal leapt out of the\r\nwater, at least eight feet high, and would speedily have pulled the whole\r\nconstruction down, had not the man run rapidly out of his sight. We trust\r\nhis temper will improve when his young bride in the adjoining room is\r\npresented to him; but she is as yet but a baby behemoth, although growing\r\nfast. The enormously strong iron railings in front of his apartments are\r\nessential to guard against the rushes he sometimes makes at persons he\r\ndoes not like. Look at that huge mouth, opened playfully to receive\r\nnic-nacs! What is a bun or a biscuit to him? Down that huge throat goes\r\none hundred pounds weight of provender daily. Surely the dragon of Wantley\r\nhad not such a gullet.\r\n\r\nThe giraffes in the adjoining apartment have been in the gardens so long\r\nthat they are no longer thought a rarity; but it should be remembered that\r\nthe four procured in 1835 from Khordofan by the agent of the society were,\r\nlike the hippopotamus, the first ever exhibited in Europe since the days\r\nof ancient Rome. Of these only one female now remains; but very many have\r\nbeen bred in the gardens, and have continued in excellent health. At the\r\npresent moment three of their progeny are housed in the apartment we are\r\nentering. The finest, a male, is a noble fellow, standing nearly seventeen\r\nfeet high. When he strides out into the inclosure, high up as the trees\r\nare protected by boarding, he yet manages to browse as in his African\r\nforests, and it is then that the visitor sees the full beauty of the\r\nbeast, which is lost in the house. The giraffe, in spite of his mild and\r\nmelancholy look, which reminds us forcibly of the camel, yet fights\r\nferociously with his kind at certain seasons of the year. Two males once\r\nbattled here so furiously that the horn of one of them was actually driven\r\ninto the head of the other. Their method of fighting is very peculiar:\r\nstretching out their fore and hind legs like a rocking-horse, they use\r\ntheir heads, as a blacksmith would a sledgehammer, and swinging the\r\nvertebral column in a manner calculated, one would think, to break it,\r\nthey bring the full force of the horns to bear upon their antagonist's\r\nskull. The blow is severe in the extreme, and every precaution is taken to\r\nprevent these conflicts.\r\n\r\nAs we pass along a narrow corridor in which the ostriches are confined, we\r\nreach at length the last inhabitant of the garden, and the most curious\r\ncreature, perhaps, which it contains. If the keeper is at hand, he will\r\nopen the door of the box in which it lives, and drive out for us the\r\nbewildered-looking apteryx--the highest representative, according to\r\nProfessor Owen, of the warm-blooded class of animals that lived in New\r\nZealand previous to the advent of man. Strange and chaotic-looking as are\r\nmost of the living things brought from Australia and the adjacent islands,\r\nthis creature is certainly the oddest of the bird class, and is, we\r\nbelieve, the only one ever seen out of New Zealand. As it vainly runs into\r\nthe corners and tries to hide itself from the light of day, we perceive\r\nthat it is wingless and tailless; it looks, in short, like a hedgehog\r\nmounted upon the dwarfed yet powerful legs of an ostrich, whilst its long\r\nbill, which seems as though it had been borrowed from a stork, is employed\r\nwhen the bird leans forward, to support it, just as an old man uses a\r\nstick. This strange creature seems to hold among the feathered bipeds of\r\nPolynesia a parallel position to the New Holland mole (_Ornithorhynchus\r\nparadoxicus_)--which possesses the bill and webbed feet of a duck with the\r\nclaws of a land animal--among the quadrupeds. Mr. Gould remarks that\r\nnature affords an appropriate vegetation to each class of animal life. Our\r\nuniversal mother seems to have matched her Flora to her Fauna in this\r\nportion of the globe; at least, the paradoxical creatures we have\r\nmentioned seem in happy accord with Australian vegetation, where the\r\nstones grow outside the cherries, and the pear-shaped fruits depend from\r\nthe branch with their small ends downwards! The apteryx is entirely\r\nnocturnal in its habits, pursuing its prey in the ground by smell rather\r\nthan by sight; to enable it to do which, the olfactory openings are placed\r\nnear the point of the beak. Thus the bird scents the worm on which it\r\nfeeds far below the surface of the ground. We must not regard the apteryx\r\nas an exceptional creature, but rather as the type of a large class of\r\nbirds peculiar to the islands of New Zealand, which have been destroyed,\r\nlike the dodo in the Mauritius, since the arrival of man. Professor Owen,\r\nlong before the apteryx arrived in England, pronounced that a single bone\r\nfound in some New Zealand watercourse had belonged to a wingless, tailless\r\nbird that stood at least twelve feet high.[9] This scientific conjecture\r\nhas lately been transformed into a certainty by the discovery of a number\r\nof bones, which demonstrate that several species of Moas once roamed among\r\nthe fern-clad islands which stud the bright Polynesian ocean. These bones\r\nhave been found mixed with those of the apteryx, which thus becomes linked\r\nto a race of mysterious creatures, which, it is supposed, have long passed\r\naway, although a tale is told--an American one, it is true--of an\r\nEnglishman having come across a dinornis, whilst out on its nocturnal\r\nrambles, and of his having fled from it with as much terror as though it\r\nhad been a griffin of old.\r\n\r\nOur walk through the gardens has only enabled us to take a cursory glance\r\nat a few of the 1,300 mammals, birds, and reptiles at present located\r\nthere; but the duty of the zoologist is to dwell minutely on each. To such\r\nthese gardens have, for the last twenty-six years, been a very\r\nfountain-head of information. During that time a grand procession of\r\nanimal life, savage and wild, has streamed through them, and for the major\r\npart has gone to that \"bourne from which no traveller returns.\" Let us\r\nrank them, and pass them before us:--\r\n\r\n  Quadrumana      1,069\r\n  Carnivora       1,409\r\n  Rodentia        1,025\r\n  Pachydermata      204\r\n  Ruminantia      1,098\r\n  Marsupialia       219\r\n  Reptilia        1,861\r\n  Aves            7,320\r\n\r\n--making a total of 14,205. Out of this large number many curious animals\r\nhave doubtless left no trace; but through the care of the Council, no rare\r\nspecimen has died, within these five years at least, without previously\r\nsitting for his portrait. The first part of the valuable collection of\r\ncoloured drawings, from the inimitable pencil of Mr. Wolf, accompanied by\r\na description from the pen of the late Mr. Mitchell, the editor of the\r\nwork, is published, under the title of \"Zoological Sketches, &c.,\" and the\r\nothers will speedily follow. The work, when completed, will be unique in\r\nthe annals of zoology, both for the extreme beauty of the drawings, which\r\nmay be said to daguerreotype the subjects in their most characteristic\r\nattitudes, and for the nature of the letterpress, which proves that the\r\neditor has written from the life.\r\n\r\nThis splendid collection has been got together by presents, purchase,\r\nbreeding, and exchanges. Out of the 14,205 specimens, however, which have\r\nbeen in the possession of the society, scarcely a tithe were bought. The\r\nQueen, especially, has been most generous in her presents, and the stream\r\nof barbaric offerings in the shape of lions, tigers, leopards, &c., which\r\nis continually flowing from tropical princes to the fair Chief of the\r\nnation, is poured into these gardens. Her Majesty evidently pays no heed\r\nto the superstition once common among the people, that a dynasty was only\r\nsafe as long as the lions flourished in the royal fortress. In fact, the\r\ngardens are a convenience to our gracious monarch as well as to her\r\nsubjects; for wild animals are awkward things to have in one's back\r\npremises. Neither must we overlook the reproduction which has taken place\r\nin the gardens; to such an extent, indeed, has the stock increased, that\r\nsales to a large amount are annually made. The system of exchanges which\r\nexists between the various British and continental societies helps to\r\nsupply the garden with deficient specimens in place of duplicates. Very\r\nrare, and consequently expensive animals, are generally purchased. Thus,\r\nthe first rhinoceros cost 1,000_l._; the four giraffes 700_l._, and their\r\ncarriage an additional 700_l._ The elephant and calf were bought in 1851\r\nfor 800_l._; and the hippopotamus, although a gift, was not brought home\r\nand housed at less than 1,000_l._--a sum which he more than realized in\r\nthe famous Exhibition season, when the receipts were 10,000_l._ above the\r\nprevious year. The lion Albert was purchased for 140_l._; a tiger in 1852\r\nfor 200_l._ The value of some of the smaller birds will appear, however,\r\nmore startling: thus, the pair of black-necked swans were purchased for\r\n80_l._ (they are now to be seen in the three-island pond); a pair of\r\ncrowned pigeons and two maleos, 60_l._; a pair of Victoria pigeons,\r\n35_l._; four mandarin ducks, 70_l._ Most of these rare birds (now in the\r\ngreat aviary) came from the Knowsley collection, at the sale of which, in\r\n1851, purchases were made to the extent of 985_l._ It would be impossible\r\nfrom these prices, however, to judge of the present value of the animals.\r\nTake the rhinoceros, for example: the first specimen cost 1,000_l._; the\r\nsecond, quite as fine a brute, only 350_l._ Lions range again from 40_l._\r\nto 180_l._, and tigers from 40_l._ to 200_l._ The price is generally ruled\r\nby the state of the wild-beast market, and by the intrinsic rarity of the\r\ncreature. A first appearance in Europe, of course, is likely to draw, and\r\nis therefore at the top price; but it is wonderful how demand produces\r\nsupply. Let any rare animal bring a crowd to the gardens, and in a\r\ntwelvemonth numbers of his brethren will be generally in the market. The\r\nignorance displayed by some persons as to the value of well-known objects\r\nis something marvellous. We have already spoken of the sea captain who\r\ndemanded 600_l._ for a pair of pythons, and at last took 40_l._! On\r\nanother occasion, an American offered the society a grisly bear for\r\n2,000_l._, to be delivered in the United States; and, more laughable\r\nstill, a moribund walrus, which had been fed for nine weeks on salt pork\r\nand meal, was offered for the trifling sum of 700_l._!\r\n\r\nWe could go on multiplying, _ad nauseam_, instances of this kind, but must\r\nconclude the catalogue of absurdities by stating that there is a firm\r\nbelief on the part of many persons that it is the Zoological Society which\r\nhas proposed the large reward, which every one has heard of, for _the_\r\ntortoiseshell Tom. \"The only one ever known\" has been offered accordingly\r\nat the exceedingly low figure of 250_l._ On one occasion a communication\r\nwas received from some person of consideration in Thuringia, requesting to\r\nbe informed of the amount of the proffered prize, which he was about to\r\nclaim. This was shortly followed by a letter from another person,\r\nevidently written in a fury, cautioning the society against giving the\r\nprize to the previous writer, as he was not the breeder of the cat, but\r\nwas only trying to buy it for less than its value, \"in which he would\r\nnever succeed so long as the true breeder lived.\" To prevent further\r\napplications on the behalf of growers of this unique animal, we may as\r\nwell state that tortoiseshell Toms may be had in many quarters.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the value of animals depends upon the state of the\r\nwild-beast market. \"Wild-beast market!\" exclaims the reader; \"and where\r\ncan that be?\" Every one knows that London can furnish anything for money;\r\nand if any lady or gentleman wants lions or tigers, there are dealers in\r\nRatcliffe Highway and the adjacent parts, who have them on the premises,\r\nand will sell them at five minutes' notice. They \"talk as familiarly of\r\nlions as ladies do of puppy dogs;\" and a gentleman who purchased a bear of\r\none of them, lately informed us that the salesman coolly proposed that he\r\nshould take him home with him in a cab! We once had occasion to visit the\r\nestablishment of one of these dealers, and were shown up a ladder into a\r\ncockloft, where, hearing a bumping, and perceiving a lifting motion in a\r\ntrap-door, we inquired the reason, which called forth the dry remark that\r\nit was only three lions at play in a box below. Although these men\r\ngenerally manage to secure their live stock in a satisfactory manner, yet\r\naccidents will occur in the best-regulated lion-stores. A wild-beast\r\nmerchant, for instance, informed us that one night he was awakened by his\r\nwife, who drew his attention to a noise in the back-yard, where he had\r\nplaced two lions on the previous evening. On putting his head out of the\r\nwindow--his room was on the ground-floor--there were the lions loose, and,\r\nwith their paws on the window-sill, looking grimly in upon him. A good\r\nwhip and a determined air consigned Leo to his cage again without further\r\ntrouble. On another occasion this same man, hearing a noise in his back\r\npremises, found to his horror that an elephant, with his pick-lock trunk,\r\nhad let out a hyæna and a nylghau from their cages, and was busy undoing\r\nthe fastenings of a den full of lions! The same resolute spirit, however,\r\nsoon restored order. Amateurs have not always the same courage or\r\nself-possession, and they immediately have recourse to the garden-folks to\r\nget them out of their difficulties, as a housekeeper would send to the\r\nstation-house on finding a burglar secreted in his cellar. On one occasion\r\na gentleman, who had offered a rattlesnake and its young to the gardens at\r\na high price, sent suddenly to the superintendent to implore immediate\r\nassistance, as the said snake, with half a score venomous offspring, had\r\nescaped from their box and scattered themselves in his nursery. The\r\npossessor, to avoid worse losses, was only too glad to be rid of his\r\nguests at any pecuniary sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWe cannot close our survey without touching upon the cost of the\r\ncommissariat. The slaughtered beasts appropriated to the carnivora, we\r\nhave before stated, cost in the year 1854 no less a sum than 1,367_l._\r\n19s. 5d. If we go through the other items of food, we shall give some\r\nnotion of the expense and the variety of the banquet to which the animals\r\ndaily sat down during that year. Thus we see hay figures for 912_l._ 14s.;\r\ncorn, seeds, &c., 700_l._ 8s. 8d.; bread, buns, &c. (for the monkeys),\r\n150_l._ 16s. 8d.; eggs, 87_l._ 4s. 1d. (for the ant-eater principally);\r\nmilk, 69_l._ 6s. 2d.; mangold-wurzel, carrots, and turnips, 22_l._ 6s.;\r\ndog-biscuit, 135_l._ 19s. 10d. (for the bears and wolves and dogs\r\nchiefly); fish (for the otters, seal, pelicans, &c.), 214_l._ 8s. 8d.;\r\ngreen tares, 23_l._ 16s. 8d.; rabbits and pigeons (for the snakes), 33_l._\r\n13s. 2d.; rice and oil-cake, 66_l._ 15s.; sundries, including fruit,\r\nvegetables, grasshoppers, snakes, mealworms, figs, sugar, &c. (for the\r\nbirds principally), 157_l._ 1s. 11d.: making a total of 3,942_l._ 8s. 3d.;\r\na great increase on the food bill of 1853, and which was caused entirely\r\nby the advance of prices.\r\n\r\nThe pitch of excellence to which the gardens have arrived has naturally\r\nresulted in drawing the increased attention of the public towards them. We\r\nhave only to contrast, for instance, the number of people who entered in\r\nthe year 1848--the first in which a more liberal system of management came\r\ninto play--with those who passed in in 1854, to see that the establishment\r\nflourishes under the auspices of the new management; for while in the\r\nformer year only 142,456 persons passed through the turnstiles, the number\r\nhad risen in the latter to 407,676. It is interesting to observe that,\r\nalthough an increase of full 100 per cent. took place upon the privileged\r\nand ordinary shilling visitors during that interval, yet that the\r\nreduction of the admittance-charge to sixpence on Mondays and holidays was\r\nthe main cause of the gradual influx of visitors--the year 1848 showing\r\nonly 60,566 admittances of these holiday-folks and working-people, to\r\n196,278 in 1854. Here, then, we have an increase of 135,712 persons, many\r\nof whom were, no doubt, rescued, on those days at least, from the\r\nfascinations of the public-house. With all this flood of life--the greater\r\nportion of it undoubtedly belonging to the labouring-classes,--not the\r\nslightest injury has been done to the gardens. A flower or two may have\r\nbeen picked, but not by that class of Englishmen who were once thought too\r\nbrutal to be allowed access unwatched to any public exhibition. Every year\r\nthat passes over our heads proves that such shows as these are splendid\r\nexamples of the method of teaching introduced by Bell and Lancaster; that\r\nthey furnish instruction of a nature which is never forgotten, and which\r\nrefines at the same time that it delights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoswell relates that the wits who assembled at the house of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds to hear Grainger's poem on the \"Sugar-cane\" read in manuscript,\r\nburst into laughter when, after much pompous blank-verse, a new paragraph\r\ncommenced with the invocation--\r\n\r\n    \"Now, Muse, let's sing of rats.\"\r\n\r\nBut if a mean topic for the bard, they are an interesting subject to the\r\nnaturalist, an anxious one to the agriculturist, and of some importance to\r\neverybody. Though it was no easy matter to throw around them a halo of\r\npoetry, and to elevate them into epic dignity--a difficulty which was\r\nnowise surmounted by calling them, as Grainger subsequently did, \"the\r\nwhisker'd vermin race\"--yet there was nothing with which they had a more\r\nserious practical connection than the \"sugar-cane.\" It was reckoned that\r\nin Jamaica they consumed a twentieth part of the entire crop, and 30,000\r\nwere destroyed in one year in a single plantation. In fact, rats are to\r\nthe earth what sparrows are to the air--universally present. Unlike their\r\nfeathered analogues, we rarely see them, and consequently have little idea\r\nof the liberality with which they are distributed over every portion of\r\nthe habitable globe. They swarm in myriads in the vast network of sewers\r\nunder our feet, and by means of our house-drains have free access to our\r\nbasements, under which they burrow; in the walls they establish a series\r\nof hidden passages; they rove beneath the floors and the roof, and thus\r\nestablish themselves above, below, and beside us. In the remote islands\r\nof the Pacific they equally abound, and are sometimes the only\r\ninhabitants. But we shall not attempt to write the universal history of\r\nthe rat. It is enough if we narrate his doings in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThere are in England two kinds of land-rats--the old English black rat,\r\nand the Norwegian or brown rat. According to Mr. Waterton, the black rat\r\nis the native and proper inhabitant of the island; the brown rat not only\r\nan interloper and exterminator, but a Whig rat--a combination which he\r\nthinks perfectly consistent. In his charming essays on Natural History he\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n    \"Though I am not aware that there are any minutes in the zoological\r\n    archives of this country which point out to us the precise time at\r\n    which this insatiate and mischievous little brute first appeared among\r\n    us, still there is a tradition current in this part of the country\r\n    (Yorkshire), that it actually came over in the same ship which\r\n    conveyed the new dynasty to these shores. My father, who was of the\r\n    first order of field naturalists, was always positive upon this point,\r\n    and he maintained firmly that it did accompany the House of Hanover in\r\n    its emigration from Germany to England.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus given the \"little brute\" a bad name, he pertinaciously hunts\r\nhim through the two volumes of his essays; nay, he does more, for, on\r\naccount of his Whiggism, he is the only wild animal banished for ever from\r\nWaterton Hall, that happy home for all other fowls of the air and beasts\r\nof the field, against which gamekeepers wage war as vermin. In Carpenter's\r\nedition of Cuvier, however, an account is given of the brown rat, or\r\nSurmulot, which, if true, entirely disposes of this pretty account of his\r\nadvent. We are there told that he originally came from Persia, where he\r\nlives in burrows, and that he did not set out on his travels until the\r\nyear 1727, when an earthquake induced him to swim the Volga and enter\r\nEurope by way of Astrakan.[10] When once he had set foot in England, he no\r\ndoubt treated his weaker brother and predecessor, the black rat, much as\r\nthe Stuart dynasty was treated by the house of Hanover. Though the black\r\nrat was not himself an usurper, but rather an emigrant who took possession\r\nof an unoccupied territory, his reign is also said by some to have been\r\ncontemporaneous with an earlier change in the royal line of England, for\r\nhe is asserted to have come over in the train of the Conqueror. He still\r\nabounds in Normandy, and to this day is known in Wales under the name of\r\nLlyoden Ffancon--the French mouse.\r\n\r\nRats are no exception to the law which, Wordsworth says, prevails among\r\n\"all the creatures of flood and field.\"\r\n\r\n                        \"The good old rule,\r\n  Sufficeth them--the simple plan,\r\n  That they should take who have the power,\r\n  And they should keep who can.\"\r\n\r\nBut the black rat has kept more than is commonly imagined. Mr. Waterton is\r\nmistaken when he adopts the popular notion that the old English breed\r\nwhich came in with the Conqueror is almost totally annihilated by his\r\nbrown cousin. The first comer has no more been destroyed by the subsequent\r\ninvader than the Celt is annihilated by the triumphant Saxon. As we find\r\nthe former still holding their ground in Cornwall, Wales, and the\r\nHighlands of Scotland, so we find the black rat flourishing in certain\r\nlocalities. In the neighbourhood of the Tower, in Whitbread's brewery, and\r\nin the Whitechapel sugar-refineries, he still holds his own, and woe be to\r\nany brown trespasser who ventures into his precincts. The weaker animal\r\nhas learnt that union is strength, and, acting in masses, they attack\r\ntheir powerful foe as fearlessly as a flight of swallows does a hawk; but\r\nif an equal number of the two breeds are placed together in a cage without\r\nfood, the chances are that all the black rats will have disappeared before\r\nmorning, and, even though well fed, the brown Brobdingnags invariably eat\r\noff the long and delicate ears of their little brethren, just as a\r\ngourmand, after a substantial meal, amuses his appetite with a\r\nwafer-biscuit.\r\n\r\nThe rapid spread of the rat is due to the fearlessness with which he will\r\nfollow man and his commissariat wherever he goes. Scarcely a ship leaves\r\na port for a distant voyage but it takes in its complement of rats as\r\nregularly as the passengers, and in this manner the destructive little\r\nanimal has not only distributed himself over the entire globe, but, like\r\nan enterprising traveller, continually passes from one country to another.\r\nThe colony of four-footed depredators, which ships itself free of expense,\r\nmakes, for instance, a voyage to Calcutta, whence many of the body will\r\nagain go to sea, and land perhaps at some uninhabited island where the\r\nvessel may have touched for water. In this manner many a hoary old\r\nwanderer has circumnavigated the globe oftener than Captain Cook, and set\r\nhis paws on twenty different shores. The rat-catcher to the East-India\r\nCompany has often destroyed as many as five hundred in a ship newly\r\narrived from Calcutta. The genuine ship-rat is a more delicate animal than\r\nthe brown rat, and has so strong a resemblance to the old Norman breed,\r\nthat we cannot help thinking they are intimately related. The same fine\r\nlarge ear, sharp nose, long tail, dark fur, and small size, characterize\r\nboth, and a like antipathy exists between them and the Norwegian species.\r\nIt is by no means uncommon to find distinct colonies of the two kinds in\r\nthe same ship--the one confining itself to the stem, the other to the\r\nstern of the vessel. The same arrangement is often adopted in the\r\nwarehouses of seaports, the ship's company generally locating themselves\r\nas near the water as possible, and the landsmen in the more inland portion\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\nWhen rats have once found their way into a ship, they are secure as long\r\nas the cargo is on board, provided they can command the great\r\nnecessary--water. If this is well guarded, they will resort to\r\nextraordinary expedients to procure it. In a rainy night they will come on\r\ndeck to drink, and will even ascend the rigging to sip the moisture which\r\nlies in the folds of the sails. When reduced to extremities, they will\r\nattack the spirit-casks and get so drunk that they are unable to walk\r\nhome. The land-rat will, in like manner, gnaw the metal tubes which in\r\npublic-houses lead from the spirit-store to the tap, and is as convivial\r\non these occasions as his nautical relation. The entire race have a quick\r\near for running liquid, and they constantly eat into leaden pipes, and,\r\nmuch to their astonishment, receive a douche-bath in consequence. It is\r\nwithout doubt the difficulty of obtaining water which causes them in many\r\ncases to desert the ship the moment she touches the shore. On such\r\noccasions they get, if possible, dry-footed to land, which they generally\r\naccomplish by passing in Indian file along the mooring-rope, though, if no\r\nother passage is provided for them, they will not hesitate to swim. In the\r\nsame manner they board ships from the shore, and so well are their\r\ninvading habits known to sailors, that it is common upon coming into port\r\nto fill up the hawser holes, or else to run the mooring-cable through a\r\nbroom, the projecting twigs of which effectually stop the ingress of these\r\nnautical quadrupeds. Their occupancy of the smaller bird-breeding islands\r\ninvariably ends in their driving away the feathered inhabitants, for they\r\nplunder the nests of their eggs, and devour the young. The puffins have in\r\nthis way been compelled to relinquish Puffin's Island, off the coast of\r\nCaernarvon.\r\n\r\nThe ship-rat must not be confounded with the water-rat, which is an\r\nentirely different species. The latter partakes of the habits of the\r\nbeaver, and is somewhat like him in appearance. He possesses the same\r\nbluff head and long fur, in which are buried his diminutive ears. He\r\ndwells in holes in the banks of rivers, which he constructs with a land\r\nand water entrance to provide against destruction by the sudden rising of\r\nthe stream. This animal lives entirely upon vegetable food, which he will\r\nnow and then seek at some distance inland, and we suspect that to him may\r\nbe traced many of the devastations in the fruit and vegetable gardens for\r\nwhich the poor sparrows get the blame. We have seen water-rats cross a\r\nwide meadow, climb the stalks of the dwarf beans, and, after detaching the\r\npods with their teeth, shell their contents in the most workmanlike\r\nmanner. They will mount vines and feed on the grapes; and a friend informs\r\nus that on one occasion he saw a water-rat go up a ladder which was\r\nresting against a plum-tree, and attack the fruit. If a garden is near the\r\nhaunts of water-rats, it is necessary to watch narrowly for the holes\r\nunderneath the walls, for they will burrow under the foundation with all\r\nthe vigour of sappers and miners. Such is the cunning with which they\r\ndrive their shafts, that they will ascend beneath a stack of wood, a heap\r\nof stones, or any other object which will conceal the passage by which\r\nthey obtain an entrance. The water-rat is, however, a rare animal compared\r\nwith its first-cousin, the common brown or Norway rat, which is likewise,\r\nas Lord Bacon says of the ant, \"a shrewd thing in a garden.\" They select,\r\naccording to Cobbett, the prime of the dessert--melons, strawberries,\r\ngrapes, and wall-fruit; and though they do but taste of each, it is not,\r\nas he remarks, very pleasant to eat after them. Not many years since they\r\nexisted in millions in the drains and sewers of the metropolis. Several\r\ncauses have been in operation to diminish their numbers, and in some\r\nquarters of the town almost wholly to extinguish them. In the first place,\r\nthe method of flushing the sewers lately adopted is exceedingly fatal to\r\nthem. When the sluices are opened, go they must with the rush of waters,\r\nand they may be seen shot out by hundreds from the mouths of the culverts\r\nin the Thames. The fact that rats are worth three shillings a dozen for\r\nsporting purposes proves, however, the most certain means of their\r\ndestruction, for it insures their ceaseless pursuit by the great hunter,\r\nman. The underground city of sewers becomes one vast hunting-ground, in\r\nwhich men regularly gain a livelihood by capturing them. Before entering\r\nthe subterraneous world, the associates generally plan what routes they\r\nwill take, and at what point they will meet, possibly with the idea of\r\ndriving their prey towards a central spot. They go in couples, each man\r\ncarrying a lighted candle with a tin reflector, a bag, a sieve, and a\r\nspade; the spade and sieve being used for examining any deposit which\r\npromises to contain some article of value. The moment the rat sees the\r\nlight, he runs along the sides of the drain just above the line of the\r\nsewage water; the men follow, and speedily overtake the winded animal,\r\nwhich no sooner finds his pursuers gaining upon him, than he sets up a\r\nshrill squeak, in the midst of which he is seized with the bare hand\r\nbehind the ears, and deposited in the bag. In this manner a dozen will\r\nsometimes be captured in as many minutes. When driven to bay at the end\r\nof a blind sewer, they will often fly at the boots of their pursuers in a\r\nmost determined manner.\r\n\r\nThe favourite stronghold of the rat is that portion of the house-drain\r\nwhich opens at right angles into the main sewer. Here he sits like a\r\nsentinel, and in security watches with his keen but astonished eyes the\r\nextraordinary apparition running with a light. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat most untrapped house-drains are inhabited by their own particular\r\nrats, and woe be to the intruder who ventures to interfere with those in\r\npossession. The rat as well as the cat may thus be classed among the\r\ndomestic animals of the household, who acts as a kind of preventive puss\r\nin keeping out the whole underground community of vermin, which otherwise\r\nwould have the run of our basements.\r\n\r\nThese vermin congregate thickest in the neighbourhood of slaughter-houses,\r\nor, in other words, where food is most plentiful. They are frequently\r\nfound sitting in clusters on the ledge formed by the invert of the sewers.\r\nAs the scavengers of drains, they undoubtedly do good service, but it is a\r\npoor set-off for the mischief they perpetrate in destroying the brickwork\r\nof the sewers--burrowing in every direction, and thus constructing lateral\r\ncesspools, the contents of which permeate the ground and filter into the\r\nwells. In making these excavations, moreover, they invariably transfer the\r\nearth to the main sewers, and form obstructions to the flow. The\r\naccumulations of their paw-work have regularly to be removed in small\r\ntrucks constructed for the purpose, and if this precaution were not taken,\r\nthey would in a few years entirely destroy the vast system of subterranean\r\nculverts which have been laboriously constructed at the expense of\r\nmillions. The pipe-drains with smooth barrels, which the rat's tooth\r\ncannot touch, alone baffle him; indeed, the rapid flow of water in their\r\nnarrow channel prevents his even retaining his footing in them. In revenge\r\nfor thus being circumvented, he has in many cases entirely ruined the\r\nnewly-laid channel of pipes by burrowing under them, and causing them to\r\ndip and open at the joints.\r\n\r\nIn France the sewer authorities hold an annual hunting-match, on which\r\noccasion there is a grand capture of rats; these animals are not destined\r\nto afford sport to the \"fancy\" under the tender manipulations of a dog\r\n\"Billy;\" on the contrary, our neighbours have too much respect for the\r\nintegrity of his hide. We are informed that they have established a\r\ncompany in Paris, upon the Hudson's Bay principle, to buy up all the rats\r\nof the country for the sake of their skin. The soft nap of the fur when\r\ndressed is of the most beautiful texture, far exceeding in delicacy that\r\nof the beaver, and the hatters consequently use it as a substitute. The\r\nhide is employed to make the thumbs of the best gloves, its elasticity and\r\ntexture rendering it preferable to kid.\r\n\r\nParent Duchâtelet collected several particulars of the rats which in his\r\nday frequented the knackers' yards at Montfaucon. Attracted by the\r\nabundance of animal food, they increased so enormously that the\r\nsurrounding inhabitants, hearing that the government intended to remove\r\nthese establishments, were seized with apprehension lest the vermin, when\r\ndeprived of their larder, should spread through the neighbourhood, and,\r\nlike a flight of locusts, swallow up everything. The alarmists may even\r\nhave feared lest they should meet with a similar fate to that of the\r\nArchbishop of Mayence, who, if old chronicles are to be believed, retired\r\nto a tower in one of the isles of the Rhine to escape being devoured by a\r\nhost of these creatures whose appetites were set upon him, and who,\r\npertinaciously pursuing him to his retreat, succeeded in eating him up at\r\nlast. The report of the Commission instituted to inquire into the\r\ncircumstances of the Montfaucon case, showed that the apprehensions of\r\nserious damage were by no means unfounded.\r\n\r\n    \"If the carcases of dead horses be thrown during the day in a corner,\r\n    the next morning they will be found stripped of their flesh. An old\r\n    proprietor of one of the slaughter-houses had a certain space of\r\n    ground entirely surrounded by walls, with holes only large enough for\r\n    the ingress and egress of rats. Within this inclosure he left the\r\n    carcases of two or three horses; and when night came, he went quietly\r\n    with his workmen, stopped up the holes, and then entered into the\r\n    inclosure, with a stick in one hand and a lighted torch in the other.\r\n    The animals covered the ground so thickly that a blow struck anywhere\r\n    did execution. By repeating the process after intervals of a few\r\n    days, he killed 16,050 rats in the space of one month, and 2,650 in a\r\n    single night. They have burrowed under all the walls and buildings in\r\n    the neighbourhood; and it is only by such precautions as putting\r\n    broken glass bottles round the foundation of a house attached to the\r\n    establishment, that the proprietor is able to preserve it. All the\r\n    neighbouring fields are excavated by them; and it is not unusual for\r\n    the earth to give way and leave these subterraneous works exposed. In\r\n    severe frost, when it becomes impossible to cut up the bodies of the\r\n    horses, and when the fragments of flesh are almost too hard for the\r\n    rats to feed upon, they enter the body and devour the flesh from the\r\n    inside, so that, when the thaw comes, the workmen find nothing below\r\n    the skin but a skeleton, better cleared of its flesh than if it had\r\n    been done by the most skilful operator. Their ferocity, as well as\r\n    their voracity, surpasses anything that can be imagined. M. Majendie\r\n    placed a dozen rats in a box in order to try some experiments; when he\r\n    reached home and opened the box, there were but three remaining; these\r\n    had devoured the rest, and had only left their bones and tails.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been informed that these rats regularly marched in troops in\r\nsearch of water in the dusk of the evening, and that they have often been\r\nmet in single file stealing beside the walls that lined the road to their\r\ndrinking-place. As the pavement in Paris overhangs the gutters, the rats\r\ntake advantage of this covered way to creep in safety from street to\r\nstreet. Their migratory habits are well known, and every neighbourhood has\r\nits tale of their travels. Mr. Jesse relates an anecdote, communicated to\r\nhim by a Sussex clergyman, which tends to prove that the old English rat\r\nat least shows a consideration and care for its elders on the march which\r\nis worthy of human philanthropy. \"Walking out in some meadows one evening,\r\nhe observed a great number of rats migrating from one place to another. He\r\nstood perfectly still, and the whole assemblage passed close to him. His\r\nastonishment, however, was great when he saw amongst the number an old\r\nblind rat, which held a piece of stick at one end in its mouth, while\r\nanother had hold of the other end of it, and thus conducted its blind\r\ncompanion.\" A kindred circumstance was witnessed in 1757 by Mr. Purdew, a\r\nsurgeon's mate on board the _Lancaster_. Lying awake one evening in his\r\nberth, he saw a rat enter, look cautiously round, and retire. He soon\r\nreturned leading a second rat, who appeared to be blind, by the ear. A\r\nthird rat joined them shortly afterwards, and assisted the original\r\nconductor in picking up fragments of biscuit and placing them before their\r\ninfirm parent, as the blind old patriarch was supposed to be. It is only\r\nwhen tormented by hunger that they appear to lose their fellow-feeling and\r\nto prey upon one another.\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of the rat in the pursuit of food is so great, that we almost\r\nwonder at the small amount of its cerebral development. Indeed, he is so\r\ncunning, and works occasionally with such human ingenuity, that accounts\r\nwhich are perfectly correct are sometimes received as mere fables.\r\nIncredible as the story may appear of their removing hens' eggs by one\r\nfellow lying on his back and grasping tightly his ovoid burden with his\r\nfore-paws, whilst his comrades drag him away by the tail, we have no\r\nreason to disbelieve it, knowing as we do that they will carry eggs from\r\nthe bottom to the top of a house, lifting them from stair to stair, the\r\nfirst rat pushing them up on its hind and the second lifting them with its\r\nfore legs. They will extract the cotton from a flask of Florence oil,\r\ndipping in their long tails, and repeating the manoeuvre until they have\r\nconsumed every drop. We have found lumps of sugar in deep drawers at a\r\ndistance of thirty feet from the place where the petty larceny was\r\ncommitted: and a friend saw a rat mount a table on which a drum of figs\r\nwas placed, and straightway tip it over, scattering its contents on the\r\nfloor beneath, where a score of his expectant brethren sat watching for\r\nthe windfall. His instinct is no less shown in the selection of suitable\r\nfood. He attacks the portion of the elephant's tusks that abounds with\r\nanimal oil, in preference to that which contains phosphate of lime; and\r\nthe rat-gnawn ivory is selected by the turner as fitted for billiard-balls\r\nand other articles where the qualities of elasticity and transparency are\r\nrequired. Thus, the tooth-print of this little animal serves as a\r\ndistinguishing mark of excellence in a precious material devoted to the\r\ndecorative arts. The rat does not confine himself to inert substances:\r\nwhen he is hard pressed for food, he will attack anything weaker than\r\nhimself. Frogs, Goldsmith says, had been introduced into Ireland some\r\nconsiderable time before the brown rat, and had multiplied abundantly, but\r\nthey were pursued in their marshes by this indefatigable hunter, and eaten\r\nclean from off the Emerald Isle. He does not scruple to assault domestic\r\npoultry; though a rat which attempted to capture the chicken of a\r\ngame-fowl was killed by the mother with beak and spur in the course of\r\ntwelve minutes. The hen seized it by the neck, shook it violently, put out\r\nan eye, and plainly showed that the fowl in a conflict would be the more\r\npowerful of the two, if he was only equally daring. The number of young\r\nducks which the rats destroyed in the Zoological Gardens rendered it\r\nnecessary to surround the pools with a wire rat-fencing, which half-way up\r\nhas a pipe of wirework, the circle of which is not complete by several\r\ninches in the under part, and the rat, unable to crawl along the concave\r\nroof which stops his onward path, is compelled to return discomfited.\r\n\r\nThe rats have been for a long time the pests of these gardens, attracted\r\nby the presence of large quantities of food. The grating under one of the\r\ntigers' dens is eaten through by this nimble-toothed burglar, who makes as\r\nlight of copper wire as of leaden pipes. Immediately upon the construction\r\nof the new monkey-house, they took possession, and eat through the floors\r\nin every direction to get at poor Jacko's bread. Vigorous measures were\r\ntaken to exclude them; the floors were filled in with concrete, and the\r\nopen roof was ceiled; but they quickly penetrated through the plaster of\r\nthe latter, as may be seen by the holes to this day. They burrowed in the\r\nold inclosure of the wombat till the ground was quite rotten; and they\r\nstill march about the den of the rhinoceros and scamper over his\r\nimpregnable hide. It is only by constantly hunting them with terriers that\r\nthey can be kept down; and as many as a hundred in a fortnight are often\r\ndespatched, their carcases being handed over to the vultures and eagles.\r\nMany of them seek in the daytime a securer retreat. They have frequently\r\nbeen seen at evening swimming in companies across the canal to forage in\r\nthe gardens through the night, and in the morning they returned to their\r\npermanent quarters by the same route.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of the bonded-wheat warehouses on the banks of the Thames\r\nare forced to take the utmost precautions against the entrance of these\r\ndepredators; otherwise, they would troop in myriads from the sewers and\r\nwaterside premises, and, as they are undoubtedly in the habit of\r\ncommunicating among their friends the whereabouts of any extraordinary\r\nsupplies, they would go on increasing day by day as the report of the good\r\nnews spread through rat-land. To repel their attentions, the wooden floors\r\nand the under parts of the doors of the granaries are lined with\r\nsheet-iron, and the foundations are sometimes set in concrete mixed with\r\nglass--matters too hard for even their teeth to discuss.\r\n\r\nCountry rats in the summer take to the fields, and create enormous havoc\r\namong the standing corn. They nibble off the ears of wheat, and carry them\r\nto their runs and burrows, where large stores have been found hoarded up\r\nwith all the forethought of the dormouse. Farmers are often puzzled to\r\naccount for the presence of rats in wheat stacks which have been placed\r\nupon the most cunningly-contrived stands. The fact is, these animals are\r\ntossed up with the sheaves to the rick, where they increase and multiply\r\nat their leisure, and frequently to such an extent, that a rick, seeming\r\nfair on the outside, is little better than a huge rat-pie.\r\n\r\nThe propensity of the rat to gnaw must not be attributed altogether to a\r\nreckless determination to overcome impediments. The never-ceasing action\r\nof his teeth is not a pastime, but a necessity of his existence. The\r\nwriter of an interesting paper on rats in _Bentley's Miscellany_ has\r\nexplained so clearly the dentistry of the tribe, that we extract his\r\naccount:--\r\n\r\n    \"The rat has formidable weapons in the shape of four small, long, and\r\n    very sharp teeth, two of which are in the upper and two in the lower\r\n    jaw. These are formed in the shape of a wedge, and by the following\r\n    wonderful provision of nature have always a fine, sharp, cutting edge.\r\n    On examining them carefully, we find that the inner part is of a soft,\r\n    ivory-like composition, which may be easily worn away, whereas the\r\n    outside is composed of a glass-like enamel, which is excessively hard.\r\n    The upper teeth work exactly into the under, so that the centres of\r\n    the opposed teeth meet exactly in the act of gnawing; the soft part is\r\n    thus being perpetually worn away, while the hard part keeps a sharp,\r\n    chisel-like edge; at the same time the teeth grow up from the bottom,\r\n    so that as they wear away a fresh supply is ready. The consequence of\r\n    this arrangement is, that, if one of the teeth be removed, either by\r\n    accident or on purpose, the opposed tooth will continue to grow\r\n    upwards, and, as there is nothing to grind them away, will project\r\n    from the mouth and turn upon itself; or, if it be an under-tooth, it\r\n    will even run into the skull above. There is a preparation in the\r\n    museum of the Royal College of Surgeons which well illustrates this\r\n    fact. It is an incisor tooth of a rat, which, from the cause above\r\n    mentioned, has increased its growth upwards to such a degree, that it\r\n    has formed a complete circle and a segment of another; the diameter of\r\n    it is about large enough to admit a good-sized thumb. It is\r\n    accompanied by the following memorandum, addressed by a Spanish priest\r\n    to Sir J. Banks, who presented it to the Museum: 'I send you an\r\n    extraordinary tooth of a rat. Believe me, it was found in the Nazareth\r\n    garden (to which order I belong). I was present when the animal was\r\n    killed, and took the tooth; I know not its virtues, nor have the\r\n    natives discovered them.'\"\r\n\r\nWe once saw a newly-killed rat to whom this misfortune had occurred. The\r\ntooth, which was an upper one, had in this case also formed a complete\r\ncircle, and the point in winding round had passed through the lip of the\r\nanimal. Thus the ceaseless working of the rat's incisors against some hard\r\nsubstance is necessary to keep them down, and if he did not gnaw for his\r\nsubsistence, he would be compelled to gnaw to prevent his jaw being\r\ngradually locked by their rapid development.\r\n\r\nThe destructive nature of the rat, the extraordinary manner in which he\r\nmultiplies, and his perpetual presence--for where there is a chink that he\r\ncan fill, and food for him to eat, there he will be, notwithstanding that\r\na long line of ancestors have one after another been destroyed on the\r\nspot[11]--necessitates some counteracting influence to keep him within due\r\nbounds. This is done by making him the prey of hunting-animals and\r\nreptiles, beginning with man, and running down the chain of organized life\r\nto the gliding snake. The poor rat, although he doubtless does service as\r\na scavenger, and must have his use in fulfilling some essential purpose of\r\ncreation, finds favour nowhere: every man's hand, nearly every feline paw,\r\nand many birds' beaks are against him. The world thinks of him, as of the\r\npauper boy in \"Oliver Twist,\"--\"Hit him hard; he ain't a'got no friends.\"\r\nDwelling in the midst of alarms, he might be supposed to pass an uneasy\r\nand nervous existence. But it is nothing of the kind. The same Providence\r\nwhich has furnished him with the teeth suitable to the work they have to\r\nperform, has endowed him with the feelings proper to his lot; and no\r\nanimal, if he be watched from a distance, appears more happy and\r\ncomplacent. In danger he preserves a wonderful presence of mind, and acts\r\nupon the principle that while there is life there is hope. His cunning on\r\nsuch occasions is often remarkable, and evinces a reasoning power of no\r\ncontemptible order:--\r\n\r\n    \"A traveller in Ceylon,\" says Mrs. Lee, in her entertaining \"Anecdotes\r\n    of Animals,\" \"saw his dogs set upon a rat, and, making them relinquish\r\n    it, he took it up by the tail, the dogs leaping after it the whole\r\n    time. He carried it into his dining-room, to examine it by the light\r\n    of the lamp, during the whole of which period it remained as if it\r\n    were dead,--limbs hanging, and not a muscle moving. After five minutes\r\n    he threw it among the dogs, who were still in a state of great\r\n    excitement, and, to the astonishment of all present, it suddenly\r\n    jumped upon its legs, and ran away so fast that it baffled all its\r\n    pursuers.\"\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of the rat in eluding danger is not less than his craftiness\r\nin dealing with it when it comes. A gentleman, Mr. Jesse relates, who fed\r\nhis own pointers, observed through a hole in the door a number of rats\r\neating from the trough with his dogs, who did not attempt to molest them.\r\nResolving to shoot the intruders, he next day put the food, but kept out\r\nthe dogs. Not a rat came to taste. He saw them peering from their holes,\r\nbut they were too well versed in human nature to venture forth without the\r\nprotection of their canine guard. After half an hour the pointers were let\r\nin, when the rats forthwith joined their hosts, and dined with them as\r\nusual. If it comes to the worst, and the rat is driven to bay, he will\r\nfight with admirable resolution. A good-sized sewer-rat has been known to\r\ndaunt for a moment the most courageous bull-terrier, advancing towards him\r\nwith tail erect, and inflicting wounds of the most desperate nature. The\r\nbite of any rat is severe, and that of a sewer-rat so highly dangerous,\r\nthat valuable dogs are rarely allowed by their masters to fight them. The\r\ngarbage on which they live poisons their teeth, and renders the wounds\r\nthey make deadly. Even with his great natural enemy and superior, the\r\nferret, he will sometimes get the advantage by his steady bravery and the\r\nsuperiority of his tactics. Mr. Jesse describes an encounter of the kind,\r\nthe circumstances of which were related to him by a medical gentleman at\r\nKingston:--\r\n\r\n    \"Being greatly surprised that the ferret, an animal of such slow\r\n    locomotive powers, should be so destructive to the rat tribe, he\r\n    determined to bring both these animals fairly into the arena, in order\r\n    to judge of their respective powers; and having selected a fine large\r\n    and full-grown male rat and also an equally strong buck ferret, which\r\n    had been accustomed to hunt rats, my friend, accompanied by his son,\r\n    turned these two animals loose in a room without furniture, in which\r\n    there was but one window. Immediately upon being liberated, the rat\r\n    ran round the room as if searching for an exit. Not finding any means\r\n    of escape, he uttered a piercing shriek, and with the most prompt\r\n    decision took up his station directly under the light, thus gaining\r\n    over his adversary (to use the language of other duellists) _the\r\n    advantage of the sun_. The ferret now erected his head, sniffed about,\r\n    and began fearlessly to push his way towards the spot where the scent\r\n    of his game was strongest, facing the light in full front, and\r\n    preparing himself with avidity to seize upon his prey. No sooner,\r\n    however, had he approached within two feet of his watchful foe, than\r\n    the rat, again uttering a loud cry, rushed at him with violence, and\r\n    inflicted a severe wound on the head and neck, which was soon shown by\r\n    the blood which flowed from it; the ferret seemed astonished at the\r\n    attack, and retreated with evident discomfiture; while the rat,\r\n    instead of following up the advantage he had gained, instantly\r\n    withdrew to his former station under the window. The ferret soon\r\n    recovered the shock he had sustained, and, erecting his head, once\r\n    more took the field. This second rencontre was in all its progress and\r\n    results an exact repetition of the former--with this exception, that,\r\n    on the rush of the rat to the conflict, the ferret appeared more\r\n    collected, and evidently showed an inclination to get a firm hold of\r\n    his enemy; the strength of the rat, however, was very great, and he\r\n    again succeeded not only in avoiding the deadly embrace of the ferret,\r\n    but also in inflicting another severe wound on his neck and head. The\r\n    rat a second time returned to his retreat under the window, and the\r\n    ferret seemed less anxious to renew the conflict. These attacks were\r\n    resumed at intervals for nearly two hours, all ending in the failure\r\n    of the ferret, who was evidently fighting to a disadvantage from the\r\n    light falling full on his eye whenever he approached the rat, who\r\n    wisely kept his ground and never for a moment lost sight of the\r\n    advantage he had gained. In order to prove whether the choice of this\r\n    position depended upon accident, my friend managed to dislodge the\r\n    rat, and took his own station under the window; but the moment the\r\n    ferret attempted to make his approach, the rat, evidently aware of the\r\n    advantage he had lost, endeavoured to creep between my friend's legs,\r\n    thus losing his natural fear of man under the danger which awaited him\r\n    from his more deadly foe.\"\r\n\r\nDriven from his defensive position, the rat continued his attacks, but\r\nwith an evident loss of courage, and the ferret ultimately came to the\r\ndeath-grapple with his crafty antagonist. A similar battle was witnessed\r\nby a friend, with the difference that the rat, being undisturbed in his\r\nadvantageous position with regard to the light, finally beat off the\r\nferret, which was absolutely bitten into shreds over the head and muzzle.\r\nThe repetition of the same conduct by a second animal shows that this\r\nparticular species of cunning is a general faculty of the tribe. The main\r\nsuperiority of the ferret is in his retaining his hold when once he has\r\nfastened on his prey, sucking his life's blood the while; whereas the rat\r\nfights by a succession of single bites, which wound but do not destroy.\r\nThe snake prevails by his venom. Mrs. Lee relates the particulars of a\r\ncombat in Africa, in which rat and snake repeatedly closed and bit at one\r\nanother, separating after each assault, and gathering up strength for a\r\nfresh attack. At length the rat fell, foamed at the mouth, swelled to a\r\ngreat size, and died in a few minutes.[12]\r\n\r\nIf he can be savage when self-protection requires, he also has his softer\r\nmoments, in which he shows confidence in man almost as strong as that\r\nexhibited by the dog or cat. An old blind rat, on whose head the snows of\r\nmany winters had gathered, was in the habit of sitting beside our own\r\nkitchen fire, with all the comfortable look of his enemy, the cat; and\r\nsuch a favourite had he become with the servants, that he was never\r\nallowed to be disturbed. He unhappily fell a victim to the sudden spring\r\nof a strange cat. A close observation of these animals entirely conquers\r\nthe antipathy which is entertained towards them. Their sharp and handsome\r\nheads, their bright eyes, their intelligent look, their sleek skins, are\r\nthe very reverse of repulsive; and there is positive attraction in the\r\nbeautiful manner in which they sit licking their paws and washing their\r\nfaces--an occupation in which they pass a considerable portion of their\r\ntime. The writer on rats in _Bentley's Miscellany_ relates an anecdote of\r\na tame rat, which shows that he is capable of serving his master as well\r\nas of passing a passive existence under his protection. The animal\r\nbelonged to the driver of a London omnibus, who caught him as he was\r\nremoving some hay. He was spared because he had the good luck to be\r\npiebald, became remarkably tame, and grew attached to the children. At\r\nnight he exhibited a sense of the enjoyment of security and warmth, by\r\nstretching himself out at full length on the rug before the fire; and on\r\ncold nights, after the fire was extinguished, he would creep into his\r\nmaster's bed. In the daytime, however, his owner utilized him. At the word\r\nof command, \"Come along, Ikey,\" he would jump into the ample great-coat\r\npocket, from which he was transferred to the boot of the omnibus. Here his\r\nbusiness was to guard the driver's dinner; and if any person attempted to\r\nmake free with it, the rat would fly at them from out the straw. There was\r\none dish alone of which he was an inefficient protector. He could never\r\nresist plum-pudding; and though he kept off all other intruders, he ate\r\nhis fill of it himself. These are by no means extraordinary instances of\r\nthe amiable side of rat nature when kindly treated by man, and we could\r\nfill pages with similar relations. But it seems, in addition to his other\r\nmerits, that he possesses dramatic genius. We have heard of military\r\nfleas, we have seen Jacko perform his miserable imitation of humanity on\r\nthe top of a barrel-organ; but who ever heard of a rat's turn for tragedy?\r\nNevertheless, a Belgian newspaper not long since published an account of a\r\ntheatrical performance by a troop of rats, which gives us a higher idea of\r\ntheir intellectual nature than anything else which is recorded of them.\r\nThis novel company of players were dressed in the garb of men and women,\r\nwalked on their hind legs, and mimicked with ludicrous exactness many of\r\nthe ordinary stage effects. On one point only were they intractable. Like\r\nthe young lady in the fable, who turned to a cat the moment a mouse\r\nappeared, they forgot their parts, their audience, and their manager, at\r\nthe sight of the viands which were introduced in the course of the piece;\r\nand, dropping on all-fours, fell to with the native voracity of their\r\nrace. The performance was concluded by their hanging in triumph their\r\nenemy the cat, and dancing round her body.\r\n\r\nThe rat, as we have said, has many enemies: the weazel, the pole-cat, the\r\notter, the dog, the cat, and the snake hunt him remorselessly all over the\r\nworld. Man, however, is his most relentless and destructive enemy. In some\r\nplaces he is killed for food, as in China, where dried split rats are sold\r\nas a dainty. The _chiffonniers_ of Paris feed on them without reluctance.\r\nNor is rat-pie altogether obsolete in our own country. The gipsies\r\ncontinue to eat such as are caught in stacks and barns, and a\r\ndistinguished surgeon of our time frequently had them served up at his\r\ntable. They feed chiefly upon grain; and it is merely the repulsive idea\r\nwhich attaches to this animal under every form that causes it to be\r\nrejected by the same man who esteems the lobster, the crab, and the shrimp\r\na delicacy, although he knows that they are the scavengers of the sea.\r\nThey were not always so nice in the navy. An old captain in her Majesty's\r\nservice informs us that on one occasion, when returning from India, the\r\nvessel was infested with rats, which made great ravages among the biscuit.\r\nJack, to compensate for his lost provisions, had all the spoilers he could\r\nkill, put into pies, and considered them an extraordinary delicacy. At the\r\nsiege of Malta, when the French were hard pressed, rats fetched a dollar\r\napiece; but the famished garrison marked their sense of the excellence of\r\nthose which were delicately fed by offering a double price for every one\r\ncaught in a granary. Man directs his hostility against the rat, however,\r\nchiefly because he considers him a nuisance; and the gin and poison, cold\r\niron and the bowl, a dismal alternative, are accordingly presented to him.\r\nWith the former he is not so easily caught, and will never enter a trap or\r\ntouch a gin in which any of his kind have fretted and rubbed. Poison is a\r\nmore effectual method, but it is not always safe. Rats which have been\r\nbeguiled into partaking of arsenic instantly make for the water to quench\r\ntheir intolerable thirst, and, though they usually withdraw from the\r\nhouse, they may resort in their agony to an in-door cistern, and remain\r\nthere to pollute it.[13] The writer who calls himself \"Uncle James,\" and\r\nwho, for a reason that will shortly appear, is exceedingly anxious to\r\nimpress the public with the belief that the best mode of getting rid of\r\nthe rat is to hunt him with terriers, states that a dairy-farmer in\r\nLimerick poisoned his calves and pigs by giving them the skim milk at\r\nwhich rats had drunk when under the pangs produced by arsenic. One mode of\r\nclearing them out of a house is either to singe the hair of a devoted rat,\r\nor else to dip his hind-quarters into tar, and then turn him loose, when\r\nthe whole community will take their leave for a while. But this is only a\r\ntemporary expedient, and in the interim the offenders are left to\r\nmultiply, and perchance transfer their ravages to another part of the\r\ndomain where they are equally mischievous. The same objection applies to\r\nthe remedy of pounding the common dog's-tongue, when gathered in full sap,\r\nand laying it in their haunts. They retire only to return. The Germans\r\nturn the rat himself into a police-officer to warn off his burglarious\r\nbrethren. Dr. Shaw, in his General Zoology, states that a gentleman who\r\ntravelled through Mecklenburg about thirty years ago saw one at a\r\npost-house with a bell about its neck, which the landlord assured him had\r\nfrightened away the whole of the \"whiskered vermin\" which previously\r\ninfested the place. Mr. Neele says that at Bangkok, the Siamese capital,\r\nthe people are in the habit of keeping tame rats, which walk about the\r\nroom, and crawl up the legs of the inmates, who pet them as they would a\r\ndog. They are caught young, and, attaining a monstrous size by good\r\nfeeding, take the place of our cats, and entirely free the house of their\r\nown kind. But the most effectual and in the end the cheapest remedy is an\r\nexpert rat-catcher. Cunning as an experienced old rat becomes, he is\r\ninvariably checkmated when man fairly tries a game of skill with him. The\r\nwell-trained professor of the art, who by long habit has grown familiar\r\nwith his adversary's haunts and tactics, his hopes and fears, his\r\npartialities and antipathies, will clear out a house or a farmyard, where\r\na novice would merely catch a few unwary adventurers and put the rest upon\r\ntheir guard. The majority of the world have, happily for themselves, a\r\nbetter office, and the regular practitioner might justly address the\r\namateur in much the same words that the musician employed to Frederick the\r\nGreat, when the royal flute-player was expecting to be complimented on his\r\nperformance: \"It would be a discredit to your Majesty to play as well as\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle James,\" however, is of a different opinion. This author considers\r\nthat every man should be his own rat-catcher, which he evidently believes\r\nto be the most improving, dignified, and fascinating calling under the\r\nsun, as he considers rats themselves to be the crying evil of the day,\r\nsecond only in his estimation to the grand injustice of the old corn-law.\r\nIndeed, we cannot see from his own premises how the evil can be second to\r\nany great destructive principle, earthquakes included. He takes a single\r\npair of rats, and proves satisfactorily that in three years, if\r\nundisturbed, they will have thirteen litters of eight each at a birth, and\r\nthat the young will begin littering again when six months old; by this\r\ncalculation he increases the original pair at the end of three years to\r\nsix hundred and fifty-six thousand eight hundred and eight. Calculating\r\nthat ten rats eat as much in one day as a man, which we think is rather\r\nunder than over the fact, the consumption of these rats would be equal \"to\r\nthat of sixty-four thousand six hundred and eight men the year round, and\r\nleave eight rats in the year to spare.\" Now, if a couple of rats could\r\noccasion such devastation in three years after the original pair marched\r\nout of the ark, how comes it that the descendants of the myriads which\r\nages ago co-existed among us have not eaten up the earth and the fullness\r\nthereof? Uncle James conveniently forgets that animals do not multiply\r\naccording to arithmetical progression, but simply in proportion to the\r\nfood provided for them. He must not, however, be expected to be wiser than\r\nMalthus on the subject of animal reproduction, and he has the additional\r\nincentive to error, that he evidently paints up his horrors for an artful\r\npurpose. There can be no sort of doubt that he has several well-bred\r\nterriers to dispose of, and hence the following panacea for all the evils\r\nwhich afflict society.\r\n\r\n    \"A dog, to be of sound service, ought to be of six to thirteen pounds\r\n    weight; over that they become too unwieldy. I would also recommend,\r\n    above all others, the London rat-killing terrier: he is as hard as\r\n    steel, courageous as a lion, and as handsome as a racehorse!--[Uncle\r\n    James is a Londoner, of course.] Let the farmers in each parish meet\r\n    and pass resolutions calling upon their representatives in parliament\r\n    to take the tax off rat-killing dogs. Let them devise plans for\r\n    procuring some well-bred terriers and ferrets, and spread the young\r\n    ones about among their men. Let there be a reward offered of so much\r\n    per head for dead rats, and let there be one person in each parish\r\n    appointed to pay for the same. Rats are valuable for manure; let there\r\n    be a pit in each locality, and let this man stick up an announcement\r\n    every week, in some conspicuous place, as to the number of rats\r\n    killed, and by whom. Then, what will be the result? Why, a spirit of\r\n    emulation will rise up among the villagers, and they will be\r\n    ransacking every hole and corner for rats. _Thus will a tone of\r\n    cheerful enterprise, activity, and pleasantry come in among them_,\r\n    'with a fund of conversation;' and instead of that crawling, dogged\r\n    monotony which characterizes their general gait and manner, they will\r\n    meet their employers and go to their labour with joyous steps and\r\n    smiling countenances.\"\r\n\r\nThe coming man, so long expected, is it seems the rat-catcher. Here is\r\nmanure multiplied, agriculture improved, food husbanded, a smiling,\r\nenlightened, and conversible peasantry--and all the result of\r\nrat-catching. But a difficulty has been overlooked. When the entire\r\npopulation is converted into rat-catchers, rats must shortly, like the\r\ndodo, be extinct. For a while we shall become an exporting country, but\r\nthis resource must fail us at last, and England's glory will expire with\r\nits rats. Then once more we shall have a sullen, silent, discontented\r\npeasantry; \"their fund of conversation\" will be exhausted, or at best the\r\nvillagers will be reduced to talk with a sigh of the golden age, never to\r\nbe renewed, when the country enjoyed the unspeakable blessing of\r\nrat-catching. In short, we fear that Uncle James has been so exclusively\r\ndevoted to the science of rat-catching, that he has neglected to cultivate\r\nthe inferior art of reasoning; but, interested as we suspect it to be, we\r\njoin in his commendation of the virtues of the terrier. The expedition\r\nwith which a clever dog will put his victims out of their misery is such\r\nthat a terrier not four pounds in weight has killed four hundred rats\r\nwithin two hours. By this we may estimate the destruction dealt to the\r\nrace by that nimble animal, \"hard as steel, courageous as a lion, and\r\nhandsome as a race-horse.\" A custom has sprung up within the last twenty\r\nyears of watching these dogs worry rats in a pit, and there are private\r\narenas of the kind where our fair countrywomen, leaning over the cushioned\r\ncircle, will witness with admiration the cleverness of their husbands' or\r\nbrothers' terriers. \"Uncle James\" might commend their taste, and think the\r\nsport calculated to furnish them with \"a fund of conversation, and a\r\nspirit of cheerful enterprise and pleasantry;\" but except the fact had\r\nproved it to be otherwise, we should have supposed that there was not an\r\neducated man in Great Britain who would not have been shocked at this\r\nnovel propensity of English ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNATIC ASYLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, whose pen has graven so deeply the social characteristics\r\nof his age, in describing to his friend Mann the terrors excited by the\r\nLord George Gordon mob, says \"they threaten to let the lions out of the\r\nTower, and the madmen out of Bedlam.\" In this short sentence we have a\r\nclear view of the opinion which our forefathers entertained of\r\nlunatics--an opinion which the pictures of Hogarth's Madhouse Cells have\r\nimpressed on the popular mind even to this day. And in truth it is not\r\nfifty years since the state of things which now exists only in the\r\nimagination of the ignorant, was both general and approved. The interior\r\nof Bethlehem at that date could furnish pictures more terrible than\r\nHogarth ever conceived. It is not our purpose, however, to dwell upon\r\nthese horrors of former days. Through the instrumentality of the late\r\nSamuel Tuke, of York, Gardner Hill, Charlesworth, Winslow, and Conolly, of\r\nLondon, the old method of treatment, with its whips, chains, and manacles,\r\nhas passed away for ever; and as a true emblem of the revolution which has\r\ntaken place, we may mention that some years since a governor, in passing\r\nthrough the laundry of Bethlehem, perceived a wrist-manacle, which had\r\nbeen converted by one of the women into a stand for a flat iron!\r\n\r\nIn spite of the ameliorations in the condition of the insane, many among\r\nthe higher, and nearly all among the lower classes, still look upon the\r\nCounty Asylum as the Bluebeard's cupboard of the neighbourhood. These\r\nunfounded ideas act as a powerful drawback to the successful treatment of\r\ninsanity, for as the vast majority of cures are effected within three\r\nmonths of the original attack, whatever deters the friends of the patient\r\nfrom bringing him under regimen at the earliest possible moment, probably\r\nensures the perpetuation of the disease. We can well imagine the undefined\r\nawe and tribulation of spirit with which the unhappy creatures who are\r\nstricken in mind enter the gates of an abode in which they are supposed to\r\nbe given over to a durance worse than death; but so mistaken is the\r\nimpression, that the feelings of desperation are almost immediately\r\nsucceeded by the inspiriting dawnings of hope. The furious maniac who\r\narrives at Colney Hatch or Hanwell in a cart, or a hand-barrow, bound with\r\nropes like a frantic animal, the terror of his friends and himself, is no\r\nsooner within the building which imagination invests with such terrors,\r\nthan half his miseries cease. The ropes cut, he stands up once more free\r\nfrom restraint, kind words are spoken to him, he is soothed by a bath,\r\nand, if still violent, the padded room, which offers no aggravating\r\nmechanical or personal resistance, calms his fury, and sleep, which has so\r\nlong been a stranger to him, visits him the first night which he spends in\r\nthe dreaded asylum. An old lady--a relapsed patient--whose silver locks\r\nhung dishevelled on her shoulders, was, when we visited Hanwell, waiting\r\nin a cab in a state of the wildest excitement. Immediately she was\r\nadmitted, and recognised the faces of the nurses who had formerly been\r\nkind to her, her whole countenance changed. \"What, you Burke and you\r\nThomson again!\" she exclaimed, delighted at renewing former friendships;\r\nand settling herself down peaceably in the ward, she appeared as\r\ncomfortable as at her own fireside.\r\n\r\nNot only have the old methods of treatment been abandoned, but many\r\nchanges have been made to render the houses for the insane less repulsive\r\nto the eye. Thousands of pounds have been spent in replacing the\r\ndungeon-like apertures (often without glass) with light-framed windows,\r\nundarkened by dismal bars; the gratings have been removed from the\r\nfireplaces; and that all the other associations may be in harmony with the\r\nimproved appearance of the building, the harsh title of keeper has given\r\nplace to that of attendant, and the madhouse has become the asylum. In the\r\nold plan, the entire treatment seemed to consist in secluding the patient\r\nfrom every sight which renders life sweet, and in wrenching him violently\r\nfrom all the conditions which formerly surrounded him; the new idea is to\r\nbring within the walls as much of the outside world as possible. Here the\r\nartisan finds employment in various handicrafts, the agricultural labourer\r\nrenews his commerce with the soil, and the female plies her needle or\r\npursues her accustomed occupations in the laundry or the kitchen.\r\nAmusement takes its turn, and those who travel by the Great Western train\r\non winter evenings are surprised to see the lights streaming from the\r\ngreat hall of Hanwell, and to hear perchance the sounds of music. These\r\nissue from the ball-room of the establishment! In place of the dark\r\ndungeon, the bonds and the blows which once added outward to inward woe,\r\nthe inmates are realising the poetic picture of Gray,--\r\n\r\n  \"With antic Sport and blue-eyed Pleasures,\r\n    Frisking light in frolic measures;\r\n  Now pursuing, now retreating,\r\n    Now in circling troops they meet:\r\n  To brisk notes in cadence beating\r\n    Glance their many-twinkling feet.\"\r\n\r\nMental aberration is not of necessity the bane of mental enjoyment. There\r\nare many sweets by which its bitterness may be diluted and diminished,\r\nthough our ancestors were so ignorant of the fact, as to believe that the\r\nbest thing to be done for a mind o'erthrown was to pour vinegar to gall.\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly, in his lately-published volume on \"The Treatment of the\r\nInsane without Mechanical Restraint,\" looks upon the banishment of the\r\nstrait-waistcoat with a just pride, for to him we owe the abolition of the\r\nlast mechanical means of coercing temporary violence; but we cannot\r\nparticipate in his fear that the selfishness and ignorance of human nature\r\nwill ever be able to restore the gloomy reign which has at last been\r\nbrought to a close. We can no more go back to the days of hobbles and\r\nhandcuffs, chains and stripes, than we can go back to the days of the rack\r\nand thumbscrew. We may have, it is true, lamentable exposures, such as\r\ntook place at Bethlehem in 1851, but the depth of the public outcry, and\r\nthe promptness with which the irregularities were remedied, is of itself\r\nan evidence that general opinion will prove the corrective of occasional\r\nabuses. Nor can we, from a fancied apprehension of the return to obsolete\r\npractices, join in the fanaticism which forbids the use of the\r\nstrait-jacket as a means of coercion under all circumstances. There can be\r\nno doubt that the treatment which requires its frequent use is a bad one;\r\nbut to deny that there are cases which call for its restraints would be to\r\ndeny the evidence of our senses. Mr. Wilkes, the late medical officer to\r\nthe Stafford County Lunatic Asylum, and now Commissioner in Lunacy, in\r\nanswer to a series of questions issued by the Commissioners on Lunacy upon\r\nthe subject, makes the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n    \"With every disposition to advocate the disuse of restraint to the\r\n    utmost extent, I am compelled to admit that the result of my\r\n    experience in this asylum, up to the present time, leads me to the\r\n    conclusion that cases may occur in which its temporary employment may\r\n    be both necessary and justifiable. Besides the occasional use of some\r\n    means of confining the hands when feeding patients by means of the\r\n    stomach-pump, a more prolonged use of restraint was necessary in two\r\n    cases which occurred some years since. One of these was a man of so\r\n    determined a suicidal disposition, that on more than one occasion he\r\n    nearly effected his purpose by trying to beat his head and face\r\n    against the walls, to throw himself from tables and chairs, and thrust\r\n    spoons and other articles down his throat. When first admitted, he was\r\n    not suspected of having any suicidal tendency, and for some weeks did\r\n    not show any; as a matter of precaution he slept in a padded room, and\r\n    one night he so battered his head with a tin vessel that he was found\r\n    nearly dead from loss of blood, and his life was subsequently in much\r\n    danger from extensive sloughing of the scalp. In this case it was\r\n    absolutely necessary to confine the hands to keep any dressings on the\r\n    head, and after the wounds had healed, and the confinement of the\r\n    hands had been discontinued, he wore a thickly-padded cap for many\r\n    months. Several years after this, he bit both his little fingers off;\r\n    and though the suicidal disposition has in a great measure subsided,\r\n    he is still at times much excited, but does not require any restraint.\r\n    The second case was one of acute mania. A powerful young man refused\r\n    all food under the impression that it was poisoned, and imagined that\r\n    every one who went near him intended to murder him. Every inducement\r\n    to get him to take food was in vain, and though a sufficient body of\r\n    attendants, under my own inspection, attempted to do what was\r\n    necessary for him, he became so much bruised in holding him in his\r\n    struggles to assail the attendants, when it was urgently requisite\r\n    that food should be administered into the stomach, that I decided upon\r\n    confining his hands, and both food and medicine were then readily\r\n    administered. The result certainly justified the means employed, as\r\n    the excitement subsided, and he soon recovered.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the experience of the medical attendant of a public asylum;\r\nnow let us hear the testimony of Dr. Forbes Winslow, whose experience in\r\nhis private asylum, Sussex House, Hammersmith, has been as great perhaps\r\nas that of any man, since he has lived with his family for ten years in\r\nthe very midst of his patients, and who is surpassed by no one in his\r\nenlightened and gentle treatment of the insane.\r\n\r\n    \"Patients,\" he says, in his Report to the Commissioners, \"have often\r\n    expressed a wish to be placed under mechanical restraint, should I, in\r\n    my judgment, believe that they would, when much excited, commit overt\r\n    acts of violence, and be dangerous to themselves and others. In cases\r\n    like these, mechanical restraint may for a short period be applied,\r\n    not only without detriment, but with positive advantage as a curative\r\n    process. Several instances relative of this fact have come under my\r\n    observation. I have seen cases where no food or medicine could be\r\n    administered without subjecting the patient to restraint. In these\r\n    cases, if all idea of cure had been abandoned, and I could have\r\n    reconciled it to my conscience to allow the disease to take its\r\n    uninterrupted course, and have permitted the patient to exist upon the\r\n    minimum amount of nutriment, and take no medicine, all restraint might\r\n    easily be dispensed with; but considering the cure of my patient\r\n    paramount to every other consideration, I had no hesitation as to the\r\n    humane and right mode of procedure.\"\r\n\r\nIn a case which came under our knowledge, a patient imagined that the\r\ntext, \"If thine eye offend thee pluck it out,\" was literally intended,\r\nand, after various attempts to comply with the command, he succeeded in\r\ndestroying the sight of one orbit. Such instances are rare, but the\r\nmedical man should at all times be prepared to meet them, instead of\r\nfolding his arms and looking helplessly on whilst the mischief is being\r\ndone, through a craven fear of the non-restraint cry. The strait-waistcoat\r\nis certainly liable to great abuse, but less than the padded room, which\r\nmay be converted into a cruel means of coercion in the hands of unwatched\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains a vast amount of restraint, which is almost as\r\nirritating, if not so strongly reprobated, as the implements which bind\r\nthe limbs of the suicidal or violent. Restraint is only comparative. The\r\nstrait-waistcoat is the narrowest zone of confinement, and the padded room\r\nbut a little wider. Next to these comes the locked gallery for a class,\r\nthen the encircling high wall for the entire lunatic community; and\r\nlastly, that aërial barrier the parole, for those who can be trusted to go\r\nbeyond the asylum. The efforts of philanthropists will not, we are\r\nconvinced, cease, until all the methods of confinement, down to the\r\nparole, are removed; or at least so disguised as to hinder their present\r\nirritating action upon the inmates. As long as the chief idea in\r\nconnection with these establishments is that they are receptacles for the\r\n_detention_ of the insane, so long perhaps the means taken to prevent\r\nflight will obtain; but when they are simply regarded as hospitals for the\r\ncure of mental disease, we shall witness the abandonment of many\r\narrangements which are as barbarous and ineffectual as the cruelties\r\npractised in the last century. The asylums where the restraint is greatest\r\nare precisely those from which the largest number of patients contrive to\r\nescape; whereas, when restrictions of all kinds are abolished, as at the\r\ninsane pauper colony of Gheel, in Belgium, but few persons ever attempt to\r\nget away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former days the public were admitted to perambulate Bedlam on the\r\npayment of twopence. A writer in the _World_ gives a narrative of a visit\r\nto it in Easter-week, 1753, when he found there a hundred holiday-makers,\r\nwho \"were suffered unattended to run rioting up and down the wards, making\r\nsport of the miserable inhabitants.\" Richardson, the novelist, had, a few\r\nyears earlier, depicted the scene in the assumed character of a young lady\r\nfrom the country, describing to her friends the sights of London.\r\n\r\n    \"I have this afternoon been with my cousins to gratify the odd\r\n    curiosity most people have to see Bethlehem, or Bedlam Hospital. A\r\n    more affecting scene my eyes never beheld. I had the shock of seeing\r\n    the late polite and ingenious Mr. ---- in one of these woful chambers.\r\n    No sooner did I put my face to the grate, but he leaped from his bed,\r\n    and called me with frightful fervency to come into his room. The\r\n    surprise affected me pretty much, and my confusion being observed by a\r\n    crowd of strangers, I heard it presently whispered that I was his\r\n    sweetheart and the cause of his misfortune. My cousin assured me that\r\n    such fancies were frequent upon these occasions; but this accident\r\n    drew so many eyes upon me as obliged me soon to quit the place. I was\r\n    much at a loss to account for the behaviour of the generality of\r\n    people who were looking at these miserable objects. Instead of the\r\n    concern I think unavoidable at such a sight, a sort of mirth appeared\r\n    on their countenances, and the distempered fancies of the miserable\r\n    patients provoked mirth and loud laughter in the unthinking auditors;\r\n    and the many hideous roarings and wild motions of others seemed\r\n    equally entertaining to them. Nay, so shamefully inhuman were some,\r\n    among whom, I am sorry to say it, were several of my own sex, as to\r\n    endeavour to provoke the patients into rage to make them sport.\"\r\n\r\nSupposed to be degraded to the level of beasts, as wild beasts they were\r\ntreated. Like them they were shut up in dens littered with straw,\r\nexhibited for money, and made to growl and roar for the diversion of the\r\nspectators who had paid their fee. No wonder that Bedlam should have\r\nbecome a word of fear; no wonder that in popular estimation the bad odour\r\nof centuries should still cling to its walls, and that the stranger,\r\ntempted by curiosity to pass beneath the shadow of its dome, should enter\r\nwith sickening trepidation. But now, instead of the howling madhouse his\r\nimagination may have painted it, he sees prim galleries filled with\r\norderly persons. Scenes of cheerfulness and content meet the eye of the\r\nvisitor as he is conducted along well-lit corridors, from which the bars\r\nand gratings of old have vanished. He stops, surprised and delighted, to\r\nlook at the engravings of Landseer's pictures on the walls, or to admire\r\nthe busts upon the brackets; he beholds tranquil persons walking around\r\nhim, or watches them feeding the birds which abound in the aviaries fitted\r\nup in the depths of the ample windows. Indeed the pet animals, such as\r\nrabbits, squirrels, &c., with the verdant ferneries, render the\r\nconvalescent wards of this hospital more cheerful than any we have seen in\r\nsimilar institutions. At intervals the monotony of the long-drawn\r\ncorridors is broken by ample-sized rooms carpeted and furnished like the\r\nbetter class of dwellings. If we pass along the female side of the\r\nhospital, we find the apartments occupied by a score of busy workers, the\r\nmajority of whom appear to be gentlewomen. Every conceivable kind of\r\nneedlework is dividing their attention with the young lady who reads aloud\r\n\"David Copperfield,\" or \"Dred;\" while beside the fire, perhaps, an old\r\nlady with silver locks gives a touch of domesticity to the scene, which we\r\nshould little have expected to meet within these walls. In traversing the\r\nmale side, instead of the workroom we find a library, in which the\r\npatients, reclining upon the sofas or lolling in arm-chairs round the\r\nfire, beguile the hours with books or the _Illustrated News_. Many a\r\nscholar, the silver chord of whose brain jingles for the moment out of\r\ntune, here finds a congenial atmosphere, and such materials for study as\r\nhe often could not obtain out-of-doors; and here many an artist,\r\nclergyman, officer, and broken-down gentleman, meets with social converse,\r\nwhich the world does not dream could exist in Bedlam.[14]\r\n\r\nNo cases of more than twelve months' standing are admitted within the\r\nwalls of Bedlam, and only ninety persons termed incurables are allowed to\r\nremain beyond that period. These regulations exclude the idiotic and\r\nepileptic patients, who form such distressing groups in other\r\nestablishments, and the interest required to obtain admission into this\r\namply endowed charity ensures at the same time a much higher class of\r\ninmates. Clergymen, barristers, governesses, literary men, artists, and\r\nmilitary and naval officers make up the staple of the assembly. The\r\nrepresentatives of the lower orders are also present, but the educated\r\nelement prevails, and the tone of dress and manners is vastly above that\r\nto be found in the pauper-swarming county asylums. There is a ball on the\r\nfirst Monday in every month, and the company that gathers in the crystal\r\nchamber at the extreme end of the south wing would not disgrace in\r\nbehaviour and appearance any sane and well-bred community. The polka, the\r\nwaltz, and the mazurka, performed with grace and ease, declare the social\r\nstanding of the assembly; and many a pedestrian who sees the dark\r\nsilhouettes of the dancers as they whirl across the light, is astonished\r\nat the festivities of the inmates. In the summer evenings the spacious\r\ncourts are crowded with the patients, not gloomily walking between four\r\ndismal walls in which the very air seemed placed under restraint, but\r\nenjoying themselves in the bowling-green or in the skittle alley. The\r\ngarden is at hand for those who love the culture of flowers. When we\r\ncontrast the condition of the Bethlehem of fifty years ago with the\r\nBethlehem of to-day, we see at a glance what a gulf has been leaped in\r\nhalf a century--a gulf on one side of which we see man, like a demon,\r\ntorturing his unfortunate fellows, on the other like a ministering angel\r\ncarrying out the all-powerful law of love. Can this be the same Bethlehem\r\nwhere, in 1808, Mr. Westerton, Mr. Calvert, and Mr. Wakefield saw ten\r\npatients in the women's gallery, each fastened by one arm or leg to the\r\nwall, with a length of chain that only allowed them to stand up by their\r\nbench, and dressed in a filthy blanket thrown poncho-like over their\r\notherwise naked bodies? Can this be the same institution in which poor\r\nNorris, like a fierce hound in a kennel, was favoured with a long chain\r\nthat passed through the wall into the next room, and which, while\r\npermitting him a little extra tether, enabled the keeper to haul him up to\r\nthe side of the cell when it was necessary to approach him? But this\r\nindulgence did not last, and from the pages of Esquirol we learn the\r\ninfernal torture which was finally put upon him.\r\n\r\n    \"A stout iron ring was riveted round his neck, from which a short\r\n    chain passed to a ring made to slide upwards or downwards on an\r\n    upright massive iron bar, more than six feet high, inserted into the\r\n    wall. Round his body a strong iron bar, about two inches wide, was\r\n    riveted; on each side of the bar was a circular projection, which,\r\n    being fastened to and enclosing each of his arms, pinioned them close\r\n    to his side.\"\r\n\r\nIn this position, in which he could only stand upright or lie upon his\r\nback, he lived for twelve years! But in nothing, perhaps, is the contrast\r\nbetween the past and the present more apparent than in the two pictures\r\npresented by Dr. Hood, the resident physician, from the case book of the\r\nBethlehem Hospital, which at once show the difference of treatment and the\r\ndifferent results which attended it.\r\n\r\n    \"A. F., admitted into the Hospital, February 6, 1808, aged 34. This\r\n    woman was born at Derby. At the age of 20 she came to London to seek\r\n    for service, but she soon lost her character. The natural violence of\r\n    her disposition was increased by her intemperance. She was the most\r\n    turbulent of all the females that disturb the night about Fleet\r\n    Market, and has been repeatedly flogged at Bridewell for her extreme\r\n    violence and disorder. She became at length the horror of the\r\n    watchmen, for punishing and imprisonment had no effect in checking her\r\n    career. She was known to her companions by the name of 'Ginger.' In\r\n    one of her paroxysms of rage she attacked the windows of the Mansion\r\n    House, and on her examination before the Lord Mayor, it appeared that\r\n    her violent disposition had gradually passed into a state of complete\r\n    madness. Under these circumstances she was sent, February 6th, 1808,\r\n    to the Hospital, and placed on the curable establishment. At the\r\n    expiration of twelve months, her lunacy continuing, she was admitted\r\n    on the incurable list. There is no record of the manner in which she\r\n    conducted herself during the first year, but it appears _that she was\r\n    chained to her bed of straw for eight years without any covering or\r\n    apparel_. So long as she continued thus coerced the violence\r\n    continued. The last entry is '_coercion still makes her ferocious, but\r\n    when left at liberty she is not in the least degree dangerous_.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"M. C., admitted into this Hospital, Sept. 30, 1853, in a state of\r\n    violent raging excitement, depending upon acute mania. She had been in\r\n    this state three days previous to her admission, and had wandered\r\n    about the streets in a comparatively naked state, under the excitement\r\n    of religious enthusiasm. She was a powerful, muscular woman; and to\r\n    bring her to the Hospital it was necessary to impose upon her the\r\n    restraint of a strait-jacket. She screamed violently all the way to\r\n    the Hospital, and used the most threatening language, refusing to\r\n    listen to anything that was said to her, but when tired of\r\n    vociferating, contented herself with kicking and spitting at those\r\n    within her reach. On admission, the mechanical restraint was removed;\r\n    she was ordered a warm bath, and two grains of the acetate of morphia,\r\n    and afterwards placed in a bed in a padded room. She continued noisy\r\n    for an hour or two, and then became quieter; but the attendant, who\r\n    looked at her every half-hour, always found her sleepless. The\r\n    following day she continued tranquil, but when addressed, responded\r\n    with an oath. She was ordered one grain and a half of acetate of\r\n    morphia. The third day she continued quiet and sullen, but permitted\r\n    the nurse to dress her and place her in a chair in the day-room with\r\n    the other patients. The following day (the fourth) she continued\r\n    tranquil and rational, rather shrinking from conversation; and being a\r\n    little feverish, was ordered 'henbane,' with a saline. From that day\r\n    she speedily became convalescent, and was discharged cured, November\r\n    11, 1853, having been a patient in the Hospital forty-two days.\"\r\n\r\nThus diversely does disordered nature answer to an appeal according to the\r\nspirit in which it is made. There is a reverse, however, to every medal,\r\nand the skeleton cupboards of Bethlehem are the male criminal lunatic\r\nwards. These dens, for we can call them by no softer name, are the only\r\nremaining representatives of old Bedlam. They consist of dismal, arched\r\ncorridors, feebly lit at either end by a single window in double irons,\r\nand divided in the middle by gratings more like those which enclose the\r\nfiercer carnivora at the Zoological Gardens than anything we have\r\nelsewhere seen employed for the detention of afflicted humanity. Here\r\nfifty male lunatics are herded together without regard to their previous\r\nsocial or moral condition. Thus the unfortunate clergyman, the Rev. Hugh\r\nWilloughby, who fired a pistol two years since at the judge at the Central\r\nCriminal Court, is herded with the plebeian perpetrator of some horrible\r\nmurder. Side by side with the unfortunate Captain Johnson, of the ship\r\n\"Tory,\" who, in a fit of extraordinary excitement during a mutiny on board\r\nhis vessel, cut down some of his crew, but is now perfectly sane, sits\r\nperhaps the ruffian who murdered the warder in cold blood at Coldbath\r\nFields--a villain brought in mad by a tender-hearted jury who shrunk from\r\nthe responsibility of hanging him. Here also poor Dad, the artist, who\r\nkilled his father whilst labouring under a sudden paroxysm of insanity, is\r\nobliged to weave his fine fancies on the canvas amidst the most revolting\r\nconversation and the most brutal behaviour. Those who contend that all\r\ncriminal lunatics should be treated alike, do not consider the vast\r\ndifference between the tone of mind in an abandoned wretch who has lived a\r\nlife of villany, and the gentleman who has committed a casual offence. As\r\nthe former advances towards sanity the brutal disposition, which early\r\ntraining in vice and dissipation has engraved upon his nature, comes into\r\nstrong relief, whilst the good breeding which is natural to the latter,\r\nand which was but temporarily eclipsed in him, resumes its sway. Nay,\r\nnothing is more certain than that the previous habits and manners of the\r\nlunatic are to a great extent unaffected by his unfortunate malady, even\r\nwhen it is at its height. The disgrace of thus caging up together the\r\ncoarse and the gentle, the virtuous and the abandoned, rests wholly upon\r\nthe shoulders of the Home Secretary. The governors of the hospitals, the\r\nmedical officers, and the lunacy commissioners, have over and over again\r\nremonstrated against the enormity, and to our national shame have\r\nremonstrated in vain. It is proposed to build a special asylum for all the\r\nstate lunatics who are now distributed among county asylums, hospitals,\r\nlicensed houses, workhouses and jails, to the number of 591,[15] and it is\r\na duty which we trust will not be longer delayed. There can be little\r\ndoubt that the presence of these crime-tainted individuals is felt deeply\r\nby the innocent lunatics, and that their recovery is retarded by the\r\nindignation excited at their degrading companionship with the outcasts of\r\nsociety. The erection of a criminal asylum upon a large scale would both\r\ncompel a better system of classification, and would necessitate some\r\nsolution of the difficult question--What shall be done with criminal\r\npatients who have recovered? One class of cases at least, as Dr. Tyler\r\nSmith has pointed out, leaves no room for doubt. The females who have\r\ncommitted offences whilst under the influence of the delirium attendant\r\nupon puerperal fever, and who, having recovered, are past the age of\r\nchild-bearing, should at once be released. They are no longer liable to a\r\nrecurrence of mental aberration, and to keep them incarcerated for life,\r\nis to treat past misfortune as an inexpiable crime. Nothing can be more\r\ncruel, unjust, and motiveless.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to remove Bethlehem Hospital into the country, on the plea\r\nthat ground cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity for the use of the\r\ninmates. If by this is meant that agricultural pursuits cannot be carried\r\non in St. George's Fields, we rejoice in the fact. A sane man, accustomed\r\nto the busy scene of a large town, would be wretched if he was condemned\r\nto pass the remainder of his days amid the silence of the fields, and the\r\nlunatic remains for the most part under the same domination of former\r\nhabits. The notion that his faculties are universally disordered, all his\r\nperceptions destroyed, all his tastes obliterated, and all his sympathies\r\nextinct, is one of the grossest errors which can prevail. Nor do the\r\nbetter class of patients (such as form the inmates of Bethlehem) require\r\nthe hard exercise which is necessary for the maintenance of health with an\r\nagricultural pauper. They find far more recreation in strolling through\r\nthe streets in the neighbourhood of the asylum, under the care of an\r\nattendant, than in wading through ploughed fields, or in taking a turn at\r\nspade husbandry. To this we must add, that insanity is often a sudden\r\nseizure, that individuals go raving mad in the streets; that, in short,\r\nthere are frightful casualties of the mind, as of the body, which require\r\nthe instant attention of the mental physician. For this reason alone every\r\nlunatic asylum should no more be removed into the country than every\r\nordinary hospital. But, apart from this circumstance, we repeat that\r\nBethlehem, within call of friends and within the hum of the busy world,\r\nglimpses of which can be caught by the patients from the loopholes of\r\ntheir retreat, and into which they are occasionally allowed to enter, is\r\nfar better placed for purposes of cure than in any rural district, however\r\nwell supplied with the means of pursuing agricultural labour. At present\r\nall the sights of the metropolis are from time to time enjoyed by the\r\ninmates. \"The male patients last year,\" says Dr. Hood, the resident\r\nphysician, \"who were not fit to be discharged, were allowed to spend a day\r\nat Kew; another day they went by steamboat to the Nore; and, conducting\r\nthemselves well under the charge of careful attendants, visited many\r\npublic exhibitions--the National Gallery, the Crystal Palace, Marlborough\r\nHouse, the Zoological Gardens, Smithfield Cattle-show, &c.\" Who can doubt\r\nthat people accustomed to such sights and sounds would infinitely prefer\r\nthem to the delights of walking between hedge-rows, hoeing weeds, or\r\ndigging potatoes? Who can doubt that these little excursions of the\r\nwall-bound inmates into the cheerful life of the outside world are a vast\r\nadvantage to the slowly-recovering brain, and constitute just that\r\ndesirable transitional training necessary to their safe restitution to\r\nunlimited freedom? In fact, under the old system, when convalescent\r\npatients, who had been confined for months in dungeon-like cells,\r\nbristling with bars, were taken to the gates and returned suddenly to\r\nunrestrained liberty, the effect of the contrast was often so great, that\r\nthey set off running in a paroxysm of excitement, and were frequently\r\nbrought back again in a few days, reduced by a too abrupt release to their\r\nold condition. It would not perhaps be undesirable to add to Bethlehem\r\nsome small rural establishment, answering to the _succursales_ of foreign\r\nlunatic asylums; but this should be strictly an appendage, to which\r\npatients should be sent for a short time, for change of air and scene,\r\njust as all the world now and then take a trip to the country to refresh\r\nthe wearied eye with the sight of green trees and fields, and to cure that\r\nmoral scurvy contracted by perpetually dwelling upon the dismal vistas of\r\nblackened bricks which constitute metropolitan prospects.\r\n\r\nFor the fullest development of the prevalent system of treating the insane\r\nwe must go to Colney Hatch and Hanwell, the two great lunatic asylums for\r\nthe county of Middlesex. The former, situated on the Great Northern\r\nRailway, only six miles from the metropolis, is the largest and perhaps\r\nthe most imposing-looking non-metropolitan building of the kind in Europe.\r\nIn this establishment, built within the last six years, we may study the\r\nmerits and demerits of modern asylums. Containing within its walls a\r\npopulation, inclusive of officers and attendants, of 1,380 persons, which\r\nis equal to that of our largest villages, and presenting the appearance of\r\na town, its wards and passages amounting in the aggregate to the length of\r\nsix miles, it is here that we shall find the completest system of\r\norganization, and, if we may use the term, of official routine. The\r\nenormous sum of money expended upon Colney Hatch, which has reached\r\nalready to £270,000, prepares us for the almost palatial character of its\r\nelevation. Its _façade_, of nearly a third of a mile, is broken at\r\nintervals by Italian campaniles and cupolas; and the whole aspect of the\r\nexterior leads the visitor to expect an interior of commensurate\r\npretensions. He no sooner crosses the threshold, however, than the scene\r\nchanges. As he passes along the corridor, which runs from end to end of\r\nthe building, he is oppressed with the gloom; the little light admitted by\r\nthe loop-holed windows is absorbed by the inky asphalte paving, and,\r\ncoupled with the low vaulting of the ceiling, gives a stifling feeling and\r\na sense of detention as in a prison. The staircases scarcely equal those\r\nof a workhouse; plaster there is none, and a coat of paint or whitewash\r\ndoes not even conceal the rugged surface of the brickwork. In the wards a\r\nsimilar state of things exists: airy and spacious they are, without doubt;\r\nbut of human interest they possess nothing. Upwards of a quarter of a\r\nmillion has been squandered principally upon the exterior of this\r\nbuilding; but not a sixpence can be spared to adorn the walls within with\r\npicture, bust, or even the commonest cottage decoration. This is the vice\r\nwhich pervades the majority of county asylums lately erected. The visiting\r\njustices doubtless believe that it would be a superfluous and even\r\nmischievous refinement to trouble themselves about pleasing the eye or\r\namusing the brain of the lunatic; but this is a mighty error, as every\r\nperson knows who understands how keenly sensitive are the minds of the\r\nmajority of the insane.\r\n\r\n  \"Stone walls do not a prison make,\r\n  Nor iron bars a cage,\"\r\n\r\nsings the graceful Lovelace; but it should be remembered that the lunatic\r\nhas no divine Althea to muse upon in his house of detention, and the\r\nmajority of the insane have no healthy wings by which their minds can leap\r\nbeyond the dreariness of the present. To divert them from the demon in\r\npossession, all the ingenuity of philanthropy should be employed; but this\r\ntruth has been overlooked both here and at Hanwell; and we are lost in\r\nastonishment when we reflect upon the folly of lavishing hundreds of\r\nthousands upon outward ornamentation, whilst the decorations common among\r\nthe poorest labourers are denied to the inmates for whom all this expense\r\nhas been incurred. There is no more touching sight at Colney Hatch than to\r\nnotice the manner in which the female lunatics have endeavoured to\r\ndiversify the monotonous appearance of their cell-like sleeping-rooms with\r\nrag dolls, bits of shell, porcelain, or bright cloth placed symmetrically\r\nin the light of the window-sill. The love of ornament seems to dwell with\r\nthem when all other mental power is lost; and they strew gay colours about\r\nthem with no more sense, but with as much enjoyment, as the bower-bird of\r\nthe Zoological Gardens adorns his playing-bower.[16] The prison dress of\r\nthe male patients is in keeping with the desolate walls. It is infinitely\r\ndepressing, even to the visitor, to see nothing but dull grey garments;\r\nand the lunatics themselves feel degraded by a uniform dedicated to the\r\ngaol-bird. The medical officers of both this asylum and Hanwell are deeply\r\nimpressed with its injurious effects, and they have long denounced it.\r\nHappily the system is confined to the men, not, however, from any\r\nbenevolent feeling towards the females, but simply because gown-pieces of\r\nthe same pattern cannot be procured in sufficient quantities to clothe the\r\nentire community. Among the sane, self-respect is increased by the\r\npossession of decent clothes, and the lunatic is often still more amenable\r\nto their influence. A refractory patient at Colney Hatch was in the habit\r\nof tearing his clothes into shreds. Mr. Tyerman, one of the medical\r\nofficers, ordered him to be dressed in a bran-new suit. The poor man, a\r\ntailor by trade, either from a professional appreciation of the value of\r\nhis new habiliments, or from being touched by this mark of attention,\r\nrespected their integrity, and from that moment rapidly recovered. Before\r\nleaving the asylum he stated that he owed his cure to the good effect\r\nproduced upon his mind by being intrusted with this new suit of clothes.\r\nAt Hanwell, the patients who destroy their dresses are put into strong\r\ncanvas garments, bound round with leather and fastened with padlocks. This\r\nplan is adopted at some other lunatic asylums; but it always looks\r\nrepulsive.\r\n\r\nIt is only, we believe, in the metropolitan county asylums, which should\r\nbe model establishments, that the grey prison dress is retained. In the\r\nmajority of county asylums the smock-frock of the district is used, and\r\nthe patient moves about undistinguished from the rest of the population by\r\nany repulsive badge. In France and Belgium they manage better still. Dr.\r\nWebster, in his notes on foreign lunatic asylums, published in the\r\n_Psychological Journal of Medicine_, speaks of the bright head-dresses and\r\nvivid shawls used in France, as giving a cheerful appearance to the\r\nassembled inmates. Nothing less could be expected from the known\r\ndisposition of a people of whom it has been said, that if any man among\r\nthem was thrown naked into the sea, he would rise up clothed from head to\r\nfoot with a sword, bag-wig, and ruffles to boot. In the present matter\r\nthey have been wiser in their generation than ourselves; and we can\r\nimagine with what surprise they would learn that at Hanwell, the most\r\ncelebrated English establishment for the treatment of the insane, patients\r\nare rewarded for good conduct by allowing them to wear a fancy waistcoat.\r\nThis fact of itself shows the aversion to the prison garb, and the\r\nnecessity of discarding it. But the same visiting committee which inspects\r\nthe county gaol governs the asylum, and we regret to say that they allow\r\nthe organization of the former to be introduced into the latter.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these drawbacks, the progress made within the last twenty\r\nyears has been immense. A walk through the wards and workshops of Colney\r\nHatch will prove that the lunatic is at last treated as though he had\r\nhuman sympathy and desires, and was capable of behaving in many respects\r\nlike a rational being. All large asylums possess an advantage over smaller\r\nones in their greater ability to classify their inmates. The wards and\r\ncorridors of Colney Hatch and Hanwell are so extensive that they may be\r\nlikened to different streets inhabited by distinct classes. It is usual to\r\nname the compartments according to the mental condition of the patients\r\ncontained in them. Thus in most asylums we have the refractory ward, the\r\nepileptic ward, the paralytic ward, the ward for dirty patients, and the\r\nconvalescent ward. At Colney Hatch it is considered better to use numbers\r\ninstead, as the patients soon become acquainted with the denomination of\r\nthe class to which they belong, and often behave in conformity with it.\r\nThus the lunatic, finding himself in a refractory ward, will sometimes act\r\nup to the part assigned to him, when he would otherwise be peaceable. The\r\nvice of classification is that it separates the population of an asylum\r\ninto so many mental castes, which in some measure prevents that easy\r\ntransition from lunacy to sanity, which it is desirable to maintain. In\r\nthe choice of difficulties, however, there can be little doubt that these\r\ndivisions in lunatic establishments, as at present constructed, present\r\nthe most convenient as well as the best means of treating the insane, and\r\nthe errors to which it is liable can at all times be obviated by the\r\ncareful supervision of the medical officers.\r\n\r\nNothing strikes the visitor with greater admiration than the care taken of\r\nthe paralytic and imbecile patients, who form so large a per-centage of\r\nthe inmates of the county asylums. In most cases the sleeping apartments\r\nof these poor creatures at Colney Hatch and Hanwell are padded round\r\nbreast-high, in order that they may not damage themselves against the\r\nwalls whilst seized with convulsions in bed; and a pillow has been\r\ninvented perfectly permeable to the air, on which they can lie with their\r\nfaces downward during the paroxysm of a fit, without the risk of\r\nsuffocation. In extreme cases even the floor is padded, lest the sufferer\r\nshould unconsciously throw himself upon it. The bed-ridden paralytic\r\nreclines upon a water-bed, and is tended night and morning as sedulously\r\nas a helpless babe. The test of the care which prevails in an asylum is to\r\nbe found in the condition of the persons who cannot help themselves. Where\r\ntrouble begins, negligence begins also, in an ill-regulated establishment.\r\nNowhere do the alleviations of humanity seem more required than with the\r\nidiots and paralytics. Of all the wards at Colney Hatch, these are the\r\nmost depressing. It is impossible to contemplate a room full of creatures\r\nmoving about on their seats with a monotonous action like a company of\r\napes, or when paralyzed in their lower limbs, to see them dragging\r\nthemselves like seals along the floor by the aid of their arms, without\r\nbeing oppressed by the sense of the dreadful condition to which man can be\r\nreduced when the mind is ruined and the nerve-power diseased. It is only\r\nin these wards and the refractory that on ordinary occasions the stranger\r\nwould discover that he was among the mentally afflicted. It is reported\r\nthat a lady, after she had been shown over a large asylum by the\r\ncelebrated Esquirol, inquired, \"But where are the mad people?\" All the\r\ninfinitely finely-shaded stages of lunacy which lie between mental health,\r\nwild fury, and chronic dementia are, in the popular idea, merged in the\r\nraving maniac. Yet it is rare for a casual visitor to witness scenes of\r\nviolence in a lunatic asylum. Those who are mischievous are trained to\r\nconcentrate their dislike upon the medical officers and attendants rather\r\nthan upon their fellow-patients. The matron of Hanwell Asylum, in her\r\nreport for 1856, thus speaks of one of the criminal lunatics who belongs\r\nto this refractory class:--\r\n\r\n    \"She seldom interferes with any other patient, the officers and\r\n    attendants being the special objects of her furious attempts, and her\r\n    mode of attack is peculiar; there is not usually anything in her\r\n    manner or appearance to indicate mischief, and she has perhaps\r\n    previously spoken calmly to the person upon whom--having watched until\r\n    she has turned her back; for as long as the face is towards her the\r\n    individual is safe--she springs with the quickness and velocity of a\r\n    tigress, fastening her hands in the hair, and bringing her victim to\r\n    the ground in an instant. If not immediately rescued, the head of the\r\n    unfortunate person is dashed repeatedly upon the floor; and it has\r\n    been found impossible hitherto to detach the hand of this patient\r\n    without a quantity of hair being torn by her from the head of the\r\n    sufferer.\"\r\n\r\nThe visiting magistrates are also highly obnoxious to the patients; and\r\ntheir passage through a ward generally leaves behind it a trail of\r\nexcitement which often generates outbreaks that do not subside for some\r\nhours. On the whole, however, it is remarkable how small an amount of\r\nviolence is attempted by the insane. In Colney Hatch, with its 1,250\r\npatients, there are far fewer personal assaults in a year than would take\r\nplace in any village containing half the number of inhabitants. Still\r\nprecautions are always necessary; and the attendants, from long\r\nobservation, are generally forewarned, and, consequently, forearmed.\r\nSpecial arrangements are made for those persons who have an unusual\r\ntendency to injure themselves or their companions. The suicidally inclined\r\nare always placed at night in dormitories with other patients, an\r\narrangement which effectually prevents any attempts at self-destruction;\r\nwhile those who have a propensity to commit homicide are provided with\r\nseparate cells. There is at the present moment a person at Colney Hatch\r\nwho labours under the delusion that he can only recover his liberty by\r\nkilling one of the keepers, and in accordance with this idea he has\r\nalready made several attempts on their lives. A lamentable death took\r\nplace at Hanwell the year before last, through the neglect on the part of\r\nan attendant to see a homicidal patient properly secured in his apartment\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 12th of April, the patients of No. 7 ward (twenty-five in\r\n    number) having had their supper, were going to bed at a quarter before\r\n    eight o'clock--all of them, being more or less refractory, have a\r\n    single bedroom each. The attendant, in seeing them to bed,\r\n    inadvertently locked up two (B. and W.) in one room; he stated that,\r\n    observing the day-clothing of all outside their doors, he supposed\r\n    that the patients were in their rooms, and, therefore, did not take\r\n    the precaution to look into them. The room No. 19 was the one usually\r\n    occupied by W., a man of exceedingly clean habits, of a mild\r\n    expression of countenance, but very violent, prone to strike suddenly\r\n    and without provocation any person within reach of him; so frequently\r\n    had he done this, that he was not allowed to sit near other patients,\r\n    even at meals, but took his food apart from them at a side-table. B.,\r\n    whose room was No. 10, directly opposite to No. 19, was occasionally\r\n    violent, always dirty in his habits, and destructive of clothing. It\r\n    is supposed that this man entered No. 19 room by mistake, and that his\r\n    presence there excited the homicidal tendency of the other into\r\n    action. What is known is, that the night-attendant, when he visited\r\n    the ward at half-past ten o'clock, and went as usual to the room No.\r\n    10, found it unoccupied, and the patient's clothes outside the door;\r\n    then hearing a noise in the room 19, he opened the door, and saw B.\r\n    extended at full length on his back on the floor, naked and quite\r\n    dead. W. came out of the room in his shirt immediately the door was\r\n    opened, and, pointing to B., said, 'That fellow will not allow me to\r\n    sleep.' There was a mark round B.'s neck as if caused by a cord, which\r\n    had produced strangulation, and a mark of a severe blow on the top of\r\n    the nose, and of a bruise on the chest: the bedclothes were in great\r\n    disorder; amongst them were found the shirt and flannel of B.; one\r\n    sleeve of the former was twisted like a rope, as if W. had strangled\r\n    B. with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe utmost precaution will not always insure safety, for patients\r\nconsidered quite harmless will now and then commit the most horrible acts.\r\nA black man, a butcher, who had been many years in an American asylum, and\r\nhad never shown any violence, one night secreted a knife, and induced\r\nanother patient to enter his cell. When his companion had lain down, he\r\ncut his throat, divided him into joints, and arranged the pieces round his\r\ncell as he had been accustomed to arrange his meat in his shop. He then\r\noffered his horrible wares to his fellow-lunatics, carrying such parts as\r\nthey desired to those who were chained. The keeper, hearing the uproar,\r\nexamined the cells, and found one man missing; upon inquiring of the black\r\nbutcher if he had seen him, he calmly replied, \"He had sold the last\r\njoint!\" Even those who have apparently harmless delusions, will sometimes,\r\nif thwarted, commit unlooked-for atrocities. Not many years since, an\r\ninquisition was held before Mr. Commissioner Winslow upon a young\r\ngentleman who would travel considerable distances to see a windmill, and\r\nsit watching it for days. His friends, to put an end to his absurd\r\npropensity, removed to a place where there were no mills. The youth, to\r\ncounteract the design, murdered a child in a wood, mangling his limbs in a\r\nterrible manner, in the hope that he should be transferred, as a\r\npunishment, to a situation whence a mill could be seen.\r\n\r\nIdleness is perhaps a greater curse to the majority of lunatics than to\r\nsane individuals. Occupation diverts the mind from its malady. Colney\r\nHatch and Hanwell, from their populousness, and from the fact of their\r\nbeing filled principally by metropolitan lunatics, afford admirable\r\nexamples of the new method of employing patients in the trades they have\r\nbeen accustomed to follow when in health. As the ranges of workshops at\r\nColney Hatch are the most extensive, we will draw our description from\r\nthat establishment. Of the male patients, only 245, out of an average of\r\n514 in the house during the year 1855, were employed in labour at all, the\r\nremainder consisting of violent maniacs and those afflicted with\r\nparalysis, epilepsy, and idiocy, none of whom are capable of undertaking\r\nany work. Sixty-five persons were allotted to the gardens, grounds, and\r\nfarms, leaving 180 to be distributed in the workshops and various offices\r\nof the asylum. The tailoring department is the most extensive. Upon the\r\noccasion of our visit, there were at least a score of cross-legged\r\nlunatics cutting out and making up grey dresses for the inmates, or\r\nrepairing old clothing, their conduct being in no manner distinguishable\r\nfrom that of sane journeymen. The shoemakers numbered a dozen, every man\r\nhandling his short knife. Those unaccustomed to lunatics will find it a\r\nnervous proceeding to thread their way among so many armed madmen, and\r\nwill wish themselves well out of this apparently dangerous assembly. Yet,\r\nin truth, they are no more to be feared than any similar number of lucid\r\nworkmen, as the homicidally inclined are carefully excluded. The\r\ncarpenters planed away merrily among their chips in an adjoining\r\napartment, using now and then chisel, gouge, and saw in perfect freedom.\r\nMany excitable patients have been placed in these shops without any bad\r\nresult; and even those who are disposed to be mischievous when suspected,\r\nhave become quiet when trusted with edge-tools of the most formidable\r\ndescription. The greater the confidence reposed in the majority of the\r\ninsane, the more does it tend to insure good behaviour. Of the other\r\nartificers in different departments, we may mention painters,\r\nupholsterers, bakers, butchers, brewers, and coopers; whilst a still\r\nlarger number are employed in the kitchen and dining-hall, or as helpers\r\nin the corridors and wards. The services of all these lunatic artisans and\r\nlabourers were valued last year at 1,059_l._ 3_s._\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, the men work at the trades they have previously\r\nfollowed; but there are many patients whose skilled labour cannot be\r\nutilized in this comparatively confined community; such, for instance, as\r\nrule-makers, jewellers, whale-bone-cutters, coach-painters, gold-beaters,\r\nbuhl-cutters, wax-doll makers, and a score of other heterogeneous\r\ncraftsmen, who are only to be found in a great metropolis. These persons\r\nengage in the employment most suited to them, and thus many of them leave\r\nthe asylum skilled in two trades. Equally efficacious is the occupation on\r\nthe farm, which contains seventy-six acres of pasture and arable land,\r\nprincipally dedicated to the rearing and maintenance of stock. On the 1st\r\nof January, 1856, there were 28 cows, 1 bull, 2 calves, 152 pigs, 40\r\nsheep, 7 horses, &c. The tending of these animals, the culture of the\r\nfields and of the thirty-one acres of ornamental grounds, the milking the\r\ncows, the slaughtering of the meat, and the production of the butter,\r\nafford varied and healthy employment to the sixty-five agriculturists.\r\nSome persons who never handled a spade before, here set to work cheerfully\r\nand with a will, and a French polisher, a Wesleyan minister, a school\r\nteacher, or a law writer, may be seen digging away at a field of potatoes;\r\nor a ship-carpenter, saddler, cabman, coalheaver, and organ-player,\r\ndiligently engaged in filling a manure-cart. They would, it is true, be\r\nbetter employed in occupations more in accordance with their previous\r\nhabits; but these cannot be found for them, and labour of any kind is\r\npreferable to idleness. On the female side of the house industry is\r\nresorted to as a means of cure to a still larger extent. Of the 503 equal\r\nto labour, 270 work as needlewomen, 7 are employed in the kitchen, 72\r\nwash, iron, and clearstarch in the laundry, 125 help in the wards, and 29\r\nattend school, and are otherwise engaged. The total value of the female\r\nlabour of the house is computed at 500_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nColney Hatch is not so extensively embarked in industrial and agricultural\r\npursuits as the North and East Riding Asylum, where the patients are\r\nreceived from a mixed manufacturing and agricultural population, and the\r\nproduce of their fields and workshops is much greater than could be\r\nextracted from worn-out metropolitan patients. Not only do the lunatics\r\nrear the vegetables, but they take them to the asylum gates and dispose of\r\nthem to the public. The result affords a proof of what we hold to be a\r\nsettled principle, that chronic cases of insanity are greatly benefited by\r\nas much intercourse as possible with the saner part of the community.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the opinion that pursuits of lunatics should be similar\r\nto their pursuits in former days, the south wing of Haslar Hospital is\r\ndevoted to the officers, seamen, and marines of her Majesty's fleet who\r\nare afflicted with insanity. Every window of the building commands a fine\r\nview of Spithead and the Isle of Wight, and here the old Salts can sit and\r\nwatch the splendid panorama crowded with vessels, and active with that\r\nnautical life which recalls so many happy associations to their minds.\r\nThey form fishing parties, make nets, and go on pleasure excursions in row\r\nand sailing craft. The \"madman's boat\" of eight oars, manned by patients\r\nand steered by an attendant, is well known to the sailors on the Solent,\r\nand so harmless are they considered, that young ladies often accompany\r\nthem on trips to the Isle of Wight, implicitly trusting in their\r\nseamanship and politeness.\r\n\r\nMental labour, as a means of cure, has not been adopted in England to any\r\ngreat extent; most asylums have their libraries, in which attentive\r\nreaders are always to be found, but the inmates rarely attempt to produce\r\namusement or instruction for their fellows. There is one signal exception\r\nto this rule in Murray's Royal Asylum at Perth. This establishment, under\r\nthe superintendence of Dr. Lauder Lindsay, appears to be the very focus of\r\nintellectual activity. The programme for the winter session of 1856-7\r\nreads more like the prospectus of the Athenæum of some large city than the\r\nbill of fare for a lunatic asylum. Famous professors reflect in its\r\nlecture-room the philosophy and science of the outer world, and their\r\nchoice of subjects would not be disavowed by the committee of a London\r\nScientific Institution.\r\n\r\n              _Lecturer._          |    _Subject._\r\n   1.

The paupers have a separate set of lectures and\r\nclasses, the major part of which are delivered and conducted by the\r\ninmates themselves. Galvanism, the Blood, Time, Economic Botany, are among\r\nthe subjects which the deranged brains of the Perth asylum are contented\r\nto hear elucidated. The activity of the place does not stop here: chamber\r\nconcerts, in which the patients perform; grand concerts, in which artists\r\nfrom without supply the leading stars; and theatrical performances, in\r\nwhich the different characters are all taken by \"resident actors,\" are\r\namong the resources which were employed to amuse and interest the inmates\r\nduring the winter months just past. A pit full of lunatics watching \"Box\r\nand Cox\" played by their fellows, is a curious subject for contemplation.\r\nNot content with these efforts, they seem to think that they are nothing\r\nunless critical, and accordingly they have set up a journal, in which they\r\nreview their own performances. The first number of _Excelsior_ is now\r\nbefore us, in which we find poetry, news, and criticisms on music, and\r\ncontemporary literature; and he who reads with the idea of finding\r\nanything odd in this production, will most certainly be mistaken; for no\r\none could divine that there was a \"bee in the bonnet\" of printer,\r\npublisher, and contributor. Balls and conversaziones form the staple of\r\nthe lighter recreations of this singular community, whilst the more\r\nathletic games of running, leaping, hurdle-racing, Highland dancing,\r\nputting the stone, footing the bar, and lifting dead weights, are pursued\r\nwith such success, that the lunatics boast with pride that they have\r\nbeaten some of the prize-holders of the outer world.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that intellectual striving was not the medicine to\r\noffer to a diseased brain; but we are informed by Dr. Lindsay that in the\r\nvast majority of cases the best results flow from this method of\r\ntreatment, and that a large percentage of cures is obtained. Such patients\r\nas would be injured by stimulating their faculties are debarred by the\r\nphysician from their undue exercise, and others must be too far gone, or\r\nbe too uninformed, to be capable of the pursuit. The surprise that\r\nlunatics should be susceptible of healthy mental exertion, arises from the\r\ncommon forgetfulness that many understandings are slightly affected, or\r\nare only deranged upon particular points. When Nat Lee was in Bedlam, he\r\nsaid that it was very difficult to write like a madman, and very easy to\r\nwrite like a fool. The works of the fools are more voluminous than the\r\nworks of the madmen, because there are more fools than lunatics; but those\r\nwho are completely mad are so far from experiencing a difficulty in\r\nwriting in their own character, that they cannot write in any other. As\r\nmany, however, who are not altogether right in their minds, are no more\r\nexclusively insane than people who are not absolutely wise are entirely\r\nfoolish, it is easy to see that they may still be equal to much profitable\r\nmental exertion. In these days poor Christopher Smart would not be\r\ndeprived of his pen and ink, and compelled to indent his long poem on\r\n\"David\" with a key on the panels of his cell; nor perhaps would the\r\nfollowing epigram, which a woman in Bedlam wrote on Martin Madan's\r\nargument in favour of polygamy, be handed about as a phenomenon to be\r\nwondered at:--\r\n\r\n  \"If John marry Mary, and Mary alone,\r\n  It is a good match between Mary and John:\r\n  But if John marry more wives, what blows and what scratches!\r\n  'Tis no longer a match, but a bundle of matches.\"\r\n\r\nIn France, and we believe in some other continental countries, it is the\r\nhabit to employ lunatic labour in the private farms surrounding the\r\nasylum. This plan was in the olden time pursued in England; but it appears\r\nto have gone out with the ancient system of coercion. When radical\r\nrevolutions are accomplished, good ideas sometimes perish with the bad;\r\nand we cannot help thinking that the abandonment of this method of\r\nexercising lunatics was an error, and that a return to the old practice,\r\nunder proper regulations, would be of advantage both to employer and\r\nemployed. Never must we lose sight of the wisdom of freeing the patient as\r\nmuch as practicable from the companionship of his fellows, and of placing\r\nhim, to the utmost of our power, in the same free condition which he\r\nenjoyed in his days of sanity.\r\n\r\nAt Colney Hatch, as at Hanwell, and indeed all other public asylums, the\r\nsexes occupy separate portions of the building, and are only allowed to be\r\npresent together on particular occasions. This unnatural arrangement\r\nundoubtedly arose from the introduction into asylums of prison and\r\nworkhouse systems of management; for certainly nothing can tend to render\r\nthe life of the patient more dreary than to find himself carefully\r\nexcluded from the company of the other half of creation. It is stated by\r\nthe advocates of separation that the mingling of the sexes among the\r\ninsane would be productive of occasional misbehaviour; but nothing could\r\nbe more unjust than to deprive the majority of the benefits which would\r\narise from frequent social reunion, in consequence of the erotic\r\ntendencies of the few. It is with pleasure, therefore, we see the attempts\r\nwhich are being made to assimilate the intercourse of lunatics to that of\r\nthe sane at Hanwell, Colney Hatch, and other asylums. The most interesting\r\nfeature of the former establishment is the ball which takes place every\r\nMonday night. Shortly after six o'clock the handsome assembly-room,\r\nbrilliantly lit with gas, becomes the central point of attraction to all\r\nthe inmates, male and female, who are considered well enough to indulge\r\ntheir inclinations for festivity. On the occasion of our visit there were\r\nabout 200 patients present, together with a few visitors and many of the\r\nattendants. In a raised orchestra five musicians, three of whom were\r\nlunatics, soon struck up a merry polka, and immediately the room was alive\r\nwith dancers. In the progress of this amusement we could see nothing\r\ngrotesque or odd. Had the men been differently dressed, it would have been\r\nimpossible to have guessed that we were in the midst of a company of\r\nlunatics, the mere sweepings of the parish workhouses; but the prison\r\nuniform of sad-coloured grey presented a disadvantageous contrast to the\r\ngayer and more varied costumes at Bethlehem, and appeared like a jarring\r\nnote amid the general harmony of the scene. In the corners of the room\r\nwhist-players, consisting generally of the older inmates, were seen intent\r\nupon their game; not a word was uttered aloud, not a gesture took place\r\nthat would have discredited any similar sane assembly; yet not a patient\r\nwas free from some strange hallucination, or some morbid impulse. Among\r\nthe merriest dancers in Sir Roger de Coverley was a man who believed\r\nhimself to be our Saviour, and who wore in his hair a spike in imitation\r\nof the crown of thorns; and one of the keenest whist-players was an old\r\nlady, who, whilst her partner was dealing, privately assured us she had\r\nbeen dead these three years, and desired as a favour that we would use our\r\ninfluence with the surgeon to persuade him to cut off her head. In the\r\nmidst of such strange delusions, it was curious to notice how rationally\r\nthose who were their dupes enjoy themselves; and it is impossible to deny\r\nthat such reunions are eminently calculated to hinder the mind from\r\nmorbidly dwelling upon its own unhealthy creations. It is found that the\r\ntoo prolonged and frequent repetition of the balls somewhat diminishes\r\ntheir interest--an evil provided against at Hanwell by restricting the\r\ntime allotted to them. At nine precisely, although in the midst of a\r\ndance, a shrill note is blown, and the entire assembly, like so many\r\nCinderellas, breaks up at once, and the company hurry off to their\r\ndormitories. These hebdomadal balls have not yet been introduced at Colney\r\nHatch. A movement has, however, been made latterly towards a limited\r\nassociation between the sexes by allowing them to dine together. Of the\r\n500 patients who assemble in the ample dining-hall, 200 are females and\r\n300 males. The scene when the women first made their appearance is\r\ndescribed as something remarkable; the men rose in a body apparently\r\ndelighted beyond measure, and the presence of the softer sex has not only\r\ntended to break the former monotony, but to keep the assembly in order and\r\ngood humour. Before this happy meeting there were occasional outbreaks of\r\nsome of the more excited patients; but now, when any of the men are\r\ninclined to be fractious or discontented, the women turn them into joke,\r\nand they are silenced immediately. As yet the two sexes are not allowed to\r\nsit at the same table, but are located on opposite sides of the room. By\r\nfar the better plan would be to seat them on different sides of the long\r\ntables; but as many persons in authority, wanting confidence in human\r\nnature, object to this natural arrangement, the innovators must be\r\nsatisfied for the moment with the present imperfect concession. When it\r\nwas first proposed to introduce a billiard-table at Bethlehem, the scheme\r\nwas rejected by a majority of two-thirds of the governors, on the score\r\nthat the players would fight each other with the cues and balls, and\r\nbagatelle, as a kind of half measure, was permitted instead. As the\r\npatients confined the balls to their legitimate purpose, and the mace was\r\nnot turned into an offensive weapon, the billiard-table was at last with\r\nreluctance established. The same thing will doubtless happen with respect\r\nto the dining arrangements at Colney Hatch; and before long we trust male\r\nand female lunatics will exchange courtesies across the table instead of\r\nacross the room.\r\n\r\nIn the chapels of nearly all the larger lunatic asylums the quieter\r\ninmates are accustomed to meet at the daily morning and evening service.\r\nIn the spacious chapels of Hanwell and Colney Hatch, the attendance on\r\nweek days, as well as on the Sabbath, is far better than can be found\r\namong the same number of people out of doors, 250 on the average attending\r\non week days, and 500 on Sundays. We do not suppose that the lunatic is\r\nmore religious than the sane, but the _ennui_ which, to a certain extent,\r\nstill attaches to the asylum renders any form of reunion agreeable; and as\r\nthe going to chapel is \"something to do,\" numbers of the inmates obey the\r\nsummons who might stay at home if they were at large. The conduct,\r\nnevertheless, of this congregation is most exemplary. \"The heartiness,\"\r\nsays the chaplain, in his report for 1856, \"with which they join in the\r\nresponses and the psalmody is very encouraging, while their quiet, orderly\r\nconduct--the prayer offered up by many on entering chapel, the regularity\r\nwith which they all kneel or sit, according to the order of the\r\nservice--would, I think, if generally witnessed, put to the blush many of\r\nour parochial congregations.\" Now and then an epileptic patient will\r\ndisturb the chapel by his heavy fall; but as those who are thus afflicted\r\nare located near the doors, the interruption is but momentary. The\r\nchaplain of Colney Hatch has trained twelve male and female patients to\r\npractise church music and psalmody. The choral service is well performed,\r\nand, in conjunction with the organ, has a visible effect in soothing the\r\nwilder patients, and in pleasing all. The sacrament is not denied to those\r\nwho are fit to receive it, and no more touching scene can be witnessed\r\nthan that which is presented in the chapel, when a score of communicants,\r\ndisordered though their minds sometimes be, humbly kneel, and\r\n\r\n  \"Drain the chalice of the grapes of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe out-of-door games of the insane are very much regulated by the extent\r\nof ground attached to the asylum. Where this is ample, as at Colney Hatch,\r\ncricket is the favourite summer recreation; a skittle-alley, a\r\nbowling-green, and a fives-court, are found in most county asylums. In\r\nAmerica, where women adopt more masculine habits than in England, female\r\nlunatics play matches on the bowling-green; and in France gymnastic\r\nexercises are employed for the exercise of both sexes, and may, we think,\r\nbe introduced into the English asylums with advantage. The idiotic\r\npatients and those who are incapable of much exertion may be seen in the\r\nairing courts enjoying the monotonous swinging motion of the machine known\r\nin domestic life under the name of \"the nursery yacht,\" being nothing more\r\nthan a rocking-horse with the horse left out by particular desire. In\r\naddition to these means of diverting the minds of the patients, walking\r\nparties, under the superintendence of officers of the establishment, are\r\nmade up two or three times a week. During the haymaking season it is\r\ncustomary to allow the inmates of asylums to which farms are attached to\r\ngo forth into the fields to assist with the rake and the pitchfork. This\r\npermission is always looked upon as a great treat, and its effect upon the\r\npatients is of the happiest kind, especially _if the scene of their\r\ntemporary labour admits no sight of the asylum and its wearisome walls_.\r\nHere for a few hours they seem to realize the liberty and delight of\r\nyounger days. The physician on such occasions may read in their \"grateful\r\neyes\" that we are at present arrived only half way on the road of\r\nnon-restraint. Individual patients, again, are suffered to leave the\r\npublic asylums on a day's visit to their friends, under the care of a\r\nnurse; and some who are nearly convalescent are permitted to go and return\r\nof their own accord. It is the custom of Colney Hatch and Hanwell, and we\r\nbelieve of most asylums in England, to grant the patients a certain period\r\nof probation among their friends, in order to test their fitness to be\r\ndischarged as cured; to give them, in short, mental tickets-of-leave. This\r\nis an admirable plan, inasmuch as it secures to the patient the full\r\nenjoyment of liberty, at the same time that it enables him to keep himself\r\nwell in hand, knowing that, as he is not unconditionally released, an\r\nimmediate recall to the asylum would follow any sign of returning\r\nirrationality.\r\n\r\nThe dietary in public asylums is ample, and the quality excellent. Hanwell\r\nmay, perhaps, be considered the model establishment in this respect. It is\r\nthe joke of the other asylums, that one man has been regaled there daily\r\nfor years with chicken and wine. Even the fancies of the patients are now\r\nand then gratified at some expense. There is an old lady in Hanwell who\r\nbelieves that the whole establishment is her private property; and, on one\r\noccasion, she complained to the medical superintendent that,\r\nnotwithstanding all the expense she was at to keep up the grounds and\r\nforcing-houses, she never could get any grapes. The next day she was\r\npresented with a bunch, which had been purchased to appease her repinings.\r\nThis humouring method of treatment, as it is called in other asylums, is\r\nmuch patronized by the matron, a person who seems to enjoy as much power\r\nas the medical officers. In her report for 1856 she thus speaks of a\r\npatient who died in the course of last year:--\r\n\r\n    \"She had been employed many years in the laundry, and always imagined\r\n    she was to be removed elsewhere--that on Monday morning a waggon would\r\n    call at the gate for herself and her property. Accordingly, every\r\n    Monday morning throughout the year, at 10 o'clock, she was accompanied\r\n    to the gate, dressed with a coloured handkerchief pinned fancifully\r\n    over her cap instead of a bonnet, and carrying a small parcel (_her\r\n    property_) of the most heterogeneous contents--thimbles, ends of tape,\r\n    polished bones, pebbles, pieces of smooth coal, &c. The waggon was\r\n    never found to be in waiting, and Mary, without evincing any\r\n    disappointment, walked cheerfully back to the laundry, telling the\r\n    superintendent that 'The waggon would be sure to come next Monday, but\r\n    that she need not lose time, so she would work all this week.'\"\r\n\r\nIn many asylums this method of treatment is thought calculated to feed the\r\noriginal delusion; but here, again, the judgment of the physician ought\r\nalone to determine the course to be taken in each individual case. In\r\npatients labouring under violent excitement, to oppose an hallucination,\r\nhowever absurd, would add fuel to the fire. Again, in a chronic case like\r\nthat of the laundry-maid, the harmless fancy of the poor creature might\r\nnot only be indulged in with impunity, but served to renew week by week\r\nher stock of cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nThe lunatic colony of Gheel, situated twelve miles south of Turnhont, in\r\nBelgium, amid a vast uncultivated plateau consisting of heath and sand,\r\ncalled the Campine, affords an extraordinary example of the pre-eminent\r\nadvantages of the present mode of managing lunatics. Until the era of\r\nrailroads this spot was so out of the ordinary track of the world, that\r\nbut few persons even of those who were interested in the treatment of the\r\ninsane were aware of its existence. Here we discover, like a fly in amber,\r\na state of things which has lasted with little change for twelve hundred\r\nyears. Here we see the last remnants of the priestly treatment of\r\ninsanity, coupled with a system of non-restraint which certainly existed\r\nlong before the term was ever heard of in England and France. Gheel owes\r\nits origin to a miracle. Saint Dympna, the daughter of an Irish king,\r\nsuffered martyrdom in this place from the hand of her father in the sixth\r\ncentury. So great was her fame as the patron saint of lunatics, that her\r\nshrine, erected in the church dedicated to her, speedily became the resort\r\nof pilgrims, who journeyed hither in the hope of being cured of their\r\nmadness or of preventing its advent. Her elegantly-sculptured tomb\r\ncontains among other bassi-relievi one in which the devil is observed\r\nissuing from the head of a female lunatic, while prayers are being offered\r\nup by some priests and nuns, and close at hand another chained maniac\r\nseems anxiously awaiting his turn to be delivered from the demon. The idea\r\ncarefully inculcated by the priests, that lunacy meant nothing more than a\r\npossession by the devil, has long been banished from other lands. Here,\r\nhowever, it has flourished for many centuries, and the ceremony of\r\ncrawling beneath the tomb has existed so long, that the hands and knees of\r\nthe devotees have worn away the pavement. The act is still occasionally\r\nperformed amid a scene in which superstition and terror are combined in a\r\nmanner calculated to cure any lunatic, if deep mental impressions were\r\nalone required to purge away his malady. But what is far more interesting\r\nand astonishing to those accustomed to the bolts and bars, the locks,\r\nwards, and high walls of crowded European asylums, is the almost entire\r\nliberty accorded to the lunatics resident in the town of Gheel and its\r\nneighbouring hamlets, to the number of 800, or one-tenth of the whole\r\ndistrict. No palatial building, such as we encounter in nearly every\r\ncounty in England, is to be seen. The little army of pauper and other\r\npatients gathered from the whole superficies of Belgium, instead of being\r\nstowed away in one gigantic establishment, in which all ideas of life are\r\nmerged in the iron routine of an enormous workhouse, are distributed over\r\nfive hundred different dwellings, three hundred of which are cottages, or\r\nsmall farmhouses, in which the more violent and poorer classes are\r\ndispersed, and the remaining two hundred are situated in the town of\r\nGheel, and are appropriated to quieter lunatics and those who are able to\r\npay more liberally for their treatment. In these habitations the sufferers\r\nare placed under the care of the host and hostess; more than three persons\r\nnever being domiciled under one roof, and generally not more than one. The\r\nlunatic shares in the usual life of the family; his occupations and\r\nemployment are theirs, his little cares and enjoyments are the same as\r\ntheirs. He goes forth to the fields to labour as in ordinary life; no\r\nstern walls perpetually imprison him, and make him desire to overleap\r\nthem, as Rasselas desired to escape even from the Happy Valley. If it is\r\nnot thought fit for him to labour with plough or spade, he remains at\r\nhome, and takes care of the children, prunes the trees in the garden, and\r\nattends to the potage on the fire; or if a female, busies herself in the\r\nordinary domestic duties of the house. The lunatics, as may be supposed,\r\nare not left to the discretionary mercies of the host and hostess. A\r\nstrict system of supervision prevails, somewhat analogous to that of the\r\nlunacy commissioners and the visiting justices of England. The entire\r\ncountry is divided into four districts, each having a head guardian and a\r\nphysician, to whom is entrusted the medical care of every inmate belonging\r\nto that section. There are, in addition, one consulting surgeon and one\r\ninspecting physician for the whole community. The general government of\r\nthe colony is vested in the hands of eight persons, who dispense a code of\r\nlaws especially devised for it. The burgomaster of Gheel presides over\r\nthis managing committee, whose duties are to distribute the patients among\r\nthe different dwellings, to watch over their treatment, and to admit or\r\ndischarge them. A visiting commissioner is annually appointed, who\r\ninspects the dwellings of the different hosts, and sees that the patients\r\nare properly cared for. The oversight of the lunatics falls almost wholly\r\nupon the hostess, the man rarely interfering, unless called upon to\r\ncontrol a disorderly patient. The people of Gheel, from having been\r\nengaged for ages in the treatment of the insane, are said to have acquired\r\nextraordinary tact in their management, which, Dr. Webster remarks, may be\r\nconsidered to exhibit a most judicious mixture of \"mildness and force.\"\r\nAlthough instruments of restraint, such as the strait-waistcoat, and the\r\nlong leathern thong below the leg, to prevent patients from running away,\r\nare occasionally resorted to, the sectional physician must be instantly\r\ninformed of their imposition, and their use cannot be continued without\r\nhis sanction. So little are they required, that Dr. Webster found less\r\nrestraint in this colony, unconfined by walls, than in the asylum at\r\nMareville, in France, containing a similar number of lunatics. Yet there\r\nwere fewer escapes than from the strictly-guarded restraint-abounding\r\nprison, only eleven persons having fled from Gheel in the course of last\r\nyear, and nineteen from Mareville. Here also, it will be observed, there\r\nis no separation of the sexes. The lunatics live the life of the other\r\ninhabitants, and males and females associate in the same household. If we\r\ncompare the effects of this simple treatment with that of the most\r\nexpensive of our own asylums, we are compelled to admit that the balance\r\nis in favour of Gheel, where, notwithstanding the free admission of\r\nchronic cases, upwards of twenty-two per cent. of cures takes place\r\nannually, while at Hanwell and Colney Hatch the cures never exceed\r\nfifteen per cent. No fair comparison can be instituted between the expense\r\nper head at Gheel and in our English establishments, inasmuch as living is\r\nmuch cheaper in Belgium; but we may state, that the average cost of board\r\nand lodging for each pauper in the colony is 10_l._ per annum, or exactly\r\nthe sum charged for lodging alone in our county asylums.[17]\r\n\r\nA plan, towards which we have been slowly advancing during the last\r\nhalf-century, will speedily, we hope, be more closely followed. A trial is\r\nalready, to some extent, being made of it in the neighbourhood of existing\r\nasylums, and might supplant, with immense advantage, the prevailing custom\r\nof building new wings, and over-populating old wards. The present system\r\nof enormous buildings, which destroys the individuality of the inmates,\r\nand suppresses all their old habits and modes of life, is evidently\r\ndisapproved by the commissioners, as appears from the language they hold\r\nin their tenth annual report:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have the best reason for believing that the patients derive a\r\n    direct benefit, in many ways, from residing in cheerful, airy\r\n    apartments detached from the main building, and associated with\r\n    officials engaged in conducting industrial pursuits. A consciousness\r\n    that he is useful, and thought worthy of confidence, is necessarily\r\n    induced in the mind of every patient, by removal from the ordinary\r\n    wards where certain restrictions are enforced, into a department where\r\n    he enjoys a comparative degree of freedom; and this necessarily\r\n    promotes self-respect and self-control, and proves highly salutary in\r\n    forwarding the patient's restoration. As a means of treatment, we\r\n    consider this species of separate residence of the utmost importance,\r\n    constituting in fact a probationary system for patients who are\r\n    convalescing; giving them greater liberty of action, extended\r\n    exercise, with facilities for occupation; and thus generating\r\n    self-confidence, and becoming not only excellent tests of the sanity\r\n    of the patient, but operating powerfully to promote a satisfactory\r\n    cure. The want of such an intermediate place of residence is always\r\n    much felt; and it often happens that a patient just recovered from an\r\n    attack of insanity, and sent into the world direct from a large\r\n    asylum, is found so unprepared to meet the trials he has to undergo,\r\n    by any previous use of his mental faculties, that he soon relapses,\r\n    and is under the necessity of being again returned within its walls.\r\n    Commodious rooms contiguous to the farm-buildings are now in the\r\n    course of construction at the Somerset County Asylum; and there is\r\n    every reason to believe that the patients will derive benefit by\r\n    residing in these apartments, which at once possess a domestic\r\n    character, and afford every facility to carry on agricultural\r\n    pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nIt strikes us forcibly that the commissioners have tended to create the\r\nevil they deprecate in not protesting against the erection of gigantic\r\nasylums; but it is cheering to find that the idea of supplemental\r\nbuildings possessing a \"domestic character\" has taken possession of their\r\nminds, and that they are now enforcing it on the minds of others with\r\ntheir well-known zeal and ability. The Devon Asylum, among others, has\r\nadopted the plan; and its accomplished physician, Dr. Bucknill, the editor\r\nof the _Asylum Journal_, bears important testimony to the great advantages\r\nto be derived from it.\r\n\r\n    \"I have recommended the erection of an inexpensive building, detached\r\n    from, but within the grounds of the present asylum, in preference to\r\n    an extension of the asylum itself. My reasons for this recommendation\r\n    are, that such a building will afford a useful and important change\r\n    for patients for whom a change from the wards is desirable. The system\r\n    of placing patients in detached buildings, resembling in their\r\n    construction and arrangements an ordinary English house, has been\r\n    found to afford beneficial results in the so-called cottages which\r\n    this institution at present possesses. _These cottages are much\r\n    preferred to the wards by the patients themselves, and permission to\r\n    reside in them is much coveted._ I am also convinced that such\r\n    auxiliary buildings can be erected at much less expense than would be\r\n    incurred by the enlargement and alteration of the asylum itself. I\r\n    propose that in the new building the patients shall cook and wash for\r\n    themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"These cottages are much preferred to the wards by the patients\r\nthemselves, and permission to reside in them is much coveted.\" In these\r\nfew lines we read the condemnation of huge structures like Colney Hatch,\r\nbuilt externally on the model of a palace, and internally on that of a\r\nworkhouse, in which the poor lunatic but rarely finds any object of human\r\ninterest, where his free-will is reduced to the level of that of a\r\nconvict, and the very air of heaven necessary to his health is doled out\r\nat intervals, when, with infinite lockings and unlockings, the attendants\r\norder a batch of persons into the stagnant and tiresome airing courts.\r\nInfinitely better for the lunatics would be the freedom and homeliness of\r\nthe smallest cottage to the formal monotony of cheerless wards; better far\r\nthat they should, as Dr. Bucknill suggests, cook and wash for themselves,\r\nthan that the offices should be performed wholesale in the steam-laundry\r\nand the steam-kitchen. A patient would undoubtedly feel a far greater\r\ninterest in peeling his own potatoes for the pot, and in cooking his own\r\nbit of bacon, than in receiving them ready cooked. It is the duty of the\r\nphysician to interest the patient in his daily work, and no more effectual\r\nmethod of accomplishing this could be suggested than in putting him to\r\nwork for himself.\r\n\r\nWherever large asylums are already erected, no better plan could perhaps\r\nbe suggested than the building of satellite cottages, which would form a\r\nkind of supplementary Gheel to the central establishment; but we should\r\nlike to see the experiment tried, in some new district, of reproducing in\r\nits integrity the Belgian system. The colony of Gheel was once a desert\r\nlike the country which surrounds it; it is now, through the happy\r\napplication of pauper lunatic labour, one of the most productive districts\r\nof the Low Countries. Have we no unoccupied Dartmoors on which we could\r\nerect cottages, and train the cottagers to receive the insane as members\r\nof the family? The performance of domestic offices, the society of the\r\ngoodwife and goodman, and the influence of the children, would do far more\r\nto restore the disordered brain of the lunatic--pauper or otherwise--than\r\nall the organization of the asylum, with its daily routine, proceeding\r\nwith the inexorable monotonous motion of a machine, and treating its\r\ninmates rather as senseless atoms than as sentient beings, capable, though\r\nmad, of taking an interest in things around them, and especially awake to\r\nthe pleasure of being dealt with as individuals rather than as\r\nundistinguishable parts of a crowd. The children are of particular\r\nmoment. Lunatics are singularly gentle to them, and are interested in all\r\ntheir actions. At Gheel it is customary to send the bairns into the fields\r\nto conduct the patients home from their labour in the evening; and we\r\nlearn from Dr. Webster that a violent madman, who would not stir upon the\r\ncommand of his host, will suffer himself to be led, without a murmur, by\r\nan urchin scarcely higher than his knee. The presence of the young in the\r\nward of an asylum seems to light it up like a sunbeam. The love of\r\nchildren does indeed lie at the very foundation of the human heart, and we\r\ncannot estimate too highly their beneficial influence upon the brain which\r\nis recovering from the horrors of insanity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important points in reference to insane paupers, as we\r\nhave already intimated, is the bringing them as speedily as possible under\r\ntreatment. The reluctance of the lunatic himself to be removed is usually\r\nextreme, and it is marvellous what ingenuity he will often employ to\r\nthwart the design. Southey relates that a madman who was being conveyed\r\nfrom Rye to Bedlam slept in the Borough. He suspected whither he was\r\ngoing, and, having contrived by rising early to elude his attendant, he\r\nwent to Bedlam, and told the keepers that he was about to bring them a\r\npatient. \"But,\" said he, \"in order to lead him willingly, he has been\r\npersuaded that I am mad, and accordingly I shall come as the madman. He\r\nwill be very outrageous when you seize him, but you must clap on a\r\nstrait-waistcoat.\" The device completely succeeded. The lunatic returned\r\nhome, the sane man was shut up, and until he was exchanged at the end of\r\nfour days, remained in his strait-waistcoat, having doubtless exhibited a\r\nviolence which amply justified its use. The aversion of the sufferer\r\nhimself to be taken away coincides with an equal aversion on the part of\r\nhis relatives and friends to send him from home, nor do they take the step\r\ntill the madness grows intolerable. Precious time is thus lost at the\r\noutset, and when the removal occurs it is mostly to the workhouse. Here\r\nthe patient is usually kept during the remainder of the curable stage of\r\nhis malady. The parochial authorities are generally guided by an immediate\r\nconsideration for the pockets of the rate-payers, rather than by any care\r\nfor the welfare of the lunatic; and, as they can maintain him in the\r\n\"house\" at three shillings a-week--when they would have to pay nine if\r\nthey transferred him to the county asylum--in the workhouse he remains\r\nuntil he becomes so dirty or troublesome in his habits that the guardians\r\nare willing to pay the difference to get rid of him. The first few months\r\nof the disease, within the narrow limits of which full 60 per cent. of the\r\nrecoveries take place, are thus allowed to run to waste. Months fly by,\r\nand the victim subsides into the class of incurables. This produces a\r\nsecond evil. As the drafts of incurables are perpetually flowing into the\r\nasylums, they become \"blocked up\" in the course of a few years, and are\r\nconverted into houses for the detention of hopeless cases. To this\r\ncondition three-fourths of the asylums are already reduced, and the\r\nefforts of philanthropic medicine are brought to a dead lock by the\r\nshort-sightedness of the parish authorities, who do not consider that for\r\nthe sake of saving a few shillings in the board of Betty Smith in the\r\nfirst weeks of her craziness, they are converting her into a chronic\r\nburthen, seeing that she will probably live on to a good old age in the\r\nasylum, and cause them an ultimate expenditure of hundreds of pounds. To\r\nthe swifter removal after the outbreak of the disorder we must look for a\r\npermanent remedy; but in the mean time something must be done to\r\ndisembarrass the public asylums of the dead-weight of hopeless cases, if\r\nwe seriously intend to take advantage of the curative appliances we\r\nalready possess. The commissioners seem inclined to favour the erection of\r\nseparate asylums for those who are beyond the reach of medical art. To us\r\nit seems that the more economical plan would be to apportion certain wards\r\nin the various workhouses for the reception of chronic cases, and to draft\r\noff the idiots alone to special establishments. By this means our\r\nwater-logged asylums would speedily right themselves, and again become\r\nwhat they should never have ceased to be--hospitals for the _cure_ of the\r\ninsane. At present we encourage an elaborate system for the manufacture of\r\nlife-long lunatics. It is well known that the cures of early cases of\r\ninsanity throughout England amount to 45 per cent., and at Bethlehem and\r\nSt. Luke's, where no others are received, the cures have amounted to 62\r\nper cent. and 72 per cent. respectively; whereas at Colney Hatch, Hanwell,\r\nand the Surrey County Asylum, the three great receptacles for the weepings\r\nof the metropolitan workhouses, the average cures do not exceed 15 per\r\ncent. If we take the lowest averages of cures, there is still a difference\r\nof 30 per cent. of human creatures who sink down into the cheerless night\r\nof chronic dementia and idiotcy, or who dream away the remainder of their\r\nlives in hopeless childishness. Another ground of complaint is, that a\r\ndegree of clerk's work is imposed upon the medical superintendents of\r\nlarge asylums which is quite inconsistent with a proper discharge of their\r\nchief duty--the recovery of their patients. Irrespective of the\r\nroutine-labour of making daily and quarterly and yearly reports, which is\r\nvery considerable, they have far more to do in their strictly professional\r\ncapacity than they can possibly accomplish. The three great asylums near\r\nthe metropolis contain upwards of 3,000 patients, or the population of a\r\ngood-sized country town; and their moral and physical training is confided\r\nto exactly six medical men, or as many as will be found in an hospital of\r\na hundred beds! It is needless to observe how little attention can be paid\r\nto each individual, and that the more promising patients must be\r\ninevitably swamped in the sea of hopeless lunatics. As long as our asylums\r\nremain mere houses of detention, the want of medical superintendence is\r\nnot so apparent; but immediately these establishments are restored to\r\ntheir proper functions, we predict that the evil will become too glaring\r\nto last.\r\n\r\nIn many boroughs the authorities have entirely evaded the requirements of\r\nthe Act of Parliament relative to their insane pauper poor, and have not\r\nonly neglected to erect proper asylums, but have resisted for years the\r\nattempts of the commissioners to compel them to do their duty. In all such\r\ncases the lunatics not only suffer the ills consequent upon insufficient\r\ncare, but when too numerous for home accommodation are subjected to a\r\nsystem of _transportation_, which is not only disgraceful to the\r\nmunicipal authorities themselves, but to the age for permitting it. True\r\nto their economical instincts, the guardians of the poor often \"farm out\"\r\ntheir insane paupers to the proprietor of some private asylum, quite\r\nregardless of distance. The commissioners, justly indignant at this sordid\r\npractice, state in one of their Reports that--\r\n\r\n    \"At present, large numbers of these patients are sent to licensed\r\n    houses far from their homes, to distances (sometimes exceeding, and\r\n    often scarcely less than, 100 miles) which their relations and friends\r\n    are unable to travel. The savings of the labouring poor are quite\r\n    insufficient, in most cases, to defray the expense of such journeys,\r\n    and their time (constituting their means of existence) cannot be\r\n    spared for that purpose. The consequence has been, that the poor\r\n    borough lunatic has been left too often to pass a considerable portion\r\n    of his life, _and in some cases to die, far from his home, and without\r\n    any of his nearest connexions having been able to comfort him by their\r\n    occasional presence_. The visits of his parish officers are\r\n    necessarily cursory and unfrequent, and he is, in fact, cast upon the\r\n    humanity of strangers, whose prosperity depends upon the profits which\r\n    they derive from maintaining him and others of his class.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a system which we are confident is as illegal as it is heartless,\r\nand we are astonished that bodies of Englishmen should dare to insult the\r\nmiseries of lunatics by thus punishing them and their friends for their\r\naffliction. There were not long since twenty-five insane paupers at\r\nCamberwell House, London, who had been sent from Southampton, a distance\r\nof eighty miles, though the Hants County Asylum is situated within sixteen\r\nmiles of the borough. Seventeen persons were in like manner banished from\r\nGreat Yarmouth to Highbridge House, near London, and their relations, who\r\nhad to travel 146 miles to see them, passed, in the course of their\r\njourney, the Norfolk and Essex County Asylums, both of which\r\nestablishments had many vacancies and would willingly have received them.\r\nThe pauper lunatics of Ipswich, King's Lynn, Dover, Canterbury,\r\nPortsmouth, and various other boroughs, are in the same way transferred by\r\nthe local authorities to some of the metropolitan licensed houses.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the poor for their afflicted relatives are often of the\r\ndeepest kind, and the utmost distress is entailed upon them by these cruel\r\nseparations from those they love. In one case, a native of Ipswich, too\r\npoor to go by the railway, walked to London and back on foot, a distance\r\nof 140 miles, for the sole purpose of visiting his wife, who had been\r\nwickedly banished to Peckham House, London. In other cases parents have\r\npleaded so piteously to be conveyed to their children, that the\r\ncommissioners have suggested that the expenses should be paid out of the\r\nparish funds, but the authorities who had contrived the original\r\nproceeding in order to save two or three shillings a head, could not of\r\ncourse be induced to furnish money for so sentimental a purpose. The\r\ncommissioners have resolutely refused their sanction to such disgraceful\r\ntransactions whenever they have come within their knowledge and\r\njurisdiction--one instance out of many which prove that, however much the\r\nborough authorities may denounce them as a centralized power, they have\r\ndone excellent service in checking local ignorance, selfishness, and\r\ninhumanity.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to consider the condition of private asylums, we shall find\r\nmuch in them to praise as well as to condemn. When men of reputation,\r\nacknowledged skill, and character--such as Drs. Conolly, Forbes Winslow,\r\nSutherland, and Munro, of London; Drs. Hitch, Noble, Newington, Fox, in\r\nthe provinces, have the management of private asylums, the public need be\r\nunder no apprehension of patients being improperly received, illegally\r\ndetained, or cruelly and unscientifically treated. The licensed houses in\r\nthe metropolitan district directly under the control of the Lunacy\r\ncommissioners, amounting to forty-one in number, represent, without doubt,\r\nthe fairest specimens of these establishments. Liable as they are at any\r\nmoment to the inspection of the commissioners, and presided over as many\r\nof them are by the most eminent members of the profession, they are\r\ngenerally maintained in a high state of efficiency. They are principally\r\ndevoted to the care of the higher classes of the community, and afford\r\nperhaps the nearest approach yet made to a perfect method of treatment,\r\nbeing conducted in most cases on the principle of a private family. The\r\nbolts, bars, high walls, and dismal airing-courts of the public asylum\r\nare either unknown, or so hidden as no longer to irritate the susceptible\r\nmind of the lunatic. The unwise division of the sexes is not as a rule\r\nadopted. Scrupulous attention to dress and all the forms of polite society\r\nare enjoined alike for their own sake, and as a method of interesting\r\npatients in the daily life of the community. When we partook of the\r\nhospitalities of one of these establishments, we could detect nothing in\r\nthe countenances or the appearance of the guests which was characteristic\r\nof their condition: the restless eye, the incoherent conversation, the\r\nsudden movement of the peculiarly formed head, which our preconceived\r\nnotions led us to expect, were none of them observable. One individual\r\nindeed there was whom we mentally concluded to be certainly mad. Yet,\r\nsingular to say, this gentleman was the only sane individual in the room,\r\nbesides ourselves and the medical superintendent; and on further\r\nacquaintance, having told our ill-placed suspicions, he frankly confessed\r\nthat he had in his own mind paid ourselves a similar compliment. The eager\r\nglance of curiosity natural to inquisitive strangers was the nearest\r\napproach in this lunatic party to the outward appearance of lunacy. So\r\nmuch for the \"unmistakeable\" countenance of the insane! It is not to be\r\nsupposed that the more violent can be allowed this social freedom even in\r\nprivate establishments, or that madness is different in a metropolitan\r\nlicensed house from what it is in a public asylum; but we unhesitatingly\r\nassert that in the vast majority of cases the large amount of freedom and\r\nthe absence of any prison-like characteristics have an undoubted effect,\r\nnot only in calming the mind of the patient, but in expediting his\r\nrecovery. Hence the per-centage of cures in a high-class private asylum\r\nare immeasurably beyond those of any public establishment. The\r\npleasure-ground, out-of-door games, carriage and riding parties,\r\nbilliards, whist and evening parties, all contribute their aid in\r\nrestoring the unhinged mind. We have seen four or five patients leave the\r\ndoors of one of these licensed metropolitan houses (the establishment of\r\nDr. Forbes Winslow, \"Sussex House,\" Hammersmith), and remain out for hours\r\nwithout any attendant, their word of _honour_ being the only tie existing\r\nbetween them and the asylum.[18]\r\n\r\nThe condition of a few of the provincial licensed houses is still\r\nglaringly bad, and shows that old ideas, with respect to insanity, are not\r\nentirely obsolete. The Report of the Commissioners of Lunacy for 1856,\r\nrelates circumstances which lead us back to the old days of Bedlam. Thus\r\nat Hanbury House the Commissioners found \"one young lady fastened by\r\nwebbing wristbands to a leathern belt; she was also tied down to her chair\r\nby a rope.\" Again, they found on their last visit to the Sandford Asylum,\r\nin December, 1855, \"a patient just dead, his body exhibiting sores and\r\nextensive sloughs, arising necessarily, we think, from want of\r\nwater-pillows or other proper precautions. The room has a stone or plaster\r\nfloor, and is without a fire.\" It is, however, encouraging to find that,\r\nas far as personal restraint goes, the very worst of our private asylums\r\nare far superior to some of the best of the public asylums of France. Dr.\r\nWebster, our great authority on this point, gives in Dr. Winslow's\r\nPsychological Journal, the results gleaned in his visits to these\r\nestablishments in the August and September of 1850:--\r\n\r\n    \"Forty male lunatics out of 1464 then resident were in _camisole_\r\n    (strait-waistcoats), some being also otherwise restrained, thereby\r\n    giving an individual in restraint to every 33-1/4 male inmates, or\r\n    three per hundred. Amongst the female lunatics, again, the proportion\r\n    was somewhat larger, 72 persons of that sex, out of the total 1902\r\n    resident patients, being under medical coercion; thus making one\r\n    female in restraint to every 26-1/3 inmates, or at the rate of 3·78\r\n    per cent. In contrast with this report respecting the above-named\r\n    French provincial asylums, I would now place an official statement of\r\n    the practice pursued at Bethlehem Hospital during the same period. At\r\n    this establishment, where formerly the strait-waistcoat, with various\r\n    kinds of personal coercion, were even in greater use than on the other\r\n    side of the Channel, _not one_ insane patient, among an average\r\n    population of 391 lunatics, was under constraint of any description\r\n    during the five weeks ending the 25th of September, when I first\r\n    visited that institution after my return from the Continent, and which\r\n    embraced the whole time referred to in this memorandum.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these curious facts it will be seen that we are far in advance of our\r\nFrench, and, we may also add, of our other continental neighbours.[19]\r\nWhen the beneficent thought struck the great Pinel to knock off the\r\nfetters of the English captain, he sounded a note which reverberated\r\nthrough Europe, and the poor insane captives issued from their dungeons in\r\nwhich they had been so long immured as the prisoners emerge from their\r\nprison to the divine strains of Beethoven's \"Fidelio.\" But when this vast\r\nstep was accomplished there still remained an immense amount of coercion\r\nscarcely less injurious than the old darkness and chains, and to\r\nEnglishmen is mainly due the credit of abolishing it. Nor shall we rest\r\nwhere we are. It is our belief as well as our hope that, before another\r\ngeneration has gone by, the last vestige of restraint, in the shape of\r\ndismal airing-courts, and outside walls, which serve to wound the spirit\r\nrather than to enslave the limbs, will pass for ever among us, and only be\r\nremembered with the hobbles and the manacles of the past.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted by some psychologists that lunacy is on the increase,\r\nand that its rapid development of late years has been consequent upon the\r\nincreased activity of the national mind. This statement is certainly\r\nstartling and calculated to arrest the attention of all thoughtful men. Is\r\nit true that civilisation has called to life a monster such as that which\r\nappalled Frankenstein? Is it a necessity of progress that it shall ever be\r\naccompanied by that fearful black rider which, like Despair, sits behind\r\nit? Does mental development mean increased mental decay? If these\r\nquestions were truly answered in the affirmative, we might indeed sigh for\r\nthe golden time when\r\n\r\n  \"Wild in woods the noble savage ran,\"\r\n\r\nfor it would be clear that the nearer humanity strove to attain towards\r\ndivine perfection, the more it was retrograding towards a state inferior\r\nto that of the brute creation. A patient examination, however, of the\r\nquestion entirely negatives such a conclusion. Dr. Ray, of the United\r\nStates, in taking the opposite view of the case, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"If we duly consider the characteristics of our times, we shall there\r\n    find abundant reason for the fact that insanity has been increasing at\r\n    a rate unparalleled in any former period. In every successive step\r\n    that has led to a higher degree of civilisation; in all the means and\r\n    appliances for developing the mental resources of the race; in the\r\n    ever-widening circle of objects calculated to influence desire, and\r\n    impel to effort, we find so many additional agencies for tasking the\r\n    mental energies, and thereby deranging the healthy equilibrium which\r\n    binds the faculties together, and leads to an harmonious result. The\r\n    press and the rostrum, the railway and the spinning-jenny, the steam\r\n    engine and the telegraph, republican institutions and social\r\n    organizations, are agencies more potent in preparing the mind for\r\n    insanity than any or all of those vices and casualties which exert a\r\n    more immediate and striking effect.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the burthen of the story of all those psychologists who believe\r\nthat insanity is fast gaining upon us; but if \"in the ever-widening circle\r\nof objects calculated to influence desire and impel to effort, we find so\r\nmany additional agencies for tasking the mental energies, and thereby\r\nderanging the healthy equilibrium which binds the faculties together,\" it\r\nshould appear that those classes of society which are in the van of\r\ncivilization should be the chief sufferers. Bankers, great speculators,\r\nmerchants, engineers, statesmen, philosophers and men of letters--those\r\nwho work with the brain rather than with their hands,--should afford the\r\nlargest proportion to the alleged increase of insanity. How does the\r\nmatter really stand? In the Report of the Commissioners in Lunacy for the\r\nyear 1847 we find the total number of private patients of the middle and\r\nupper classes then under confinement in private asylums, amounted to\r\n4,649. Now, if we skip eight years, and refer to the Report of 1855, we\r\nfind that there were only 4,557 patients under confinement, or about 96\r\nless, notwithstanding the increase of population during that period. If we\r\ncompare the number of pauper lunatics under confinement at these two\r\ndifferent periods, we shall find a widely-different state of things; for\r\nin 1847 there were 9,654 in our public and private asylums, whilst in 1855\r\nthey numbered 15,822. In other words, our pauper lunatics would _appear_\r\nto have increased 6,170 in eight years, or upwards of 64 per cent. It is\r\nthis extraordinary increase of pauper lunatics in the county asylums which\r\nhas frightened some psychologists from their propriety, and led them to\r\nbelieve that insanity is running a winning race with the healthy\r\nintellect. But these figures, if they mean anything, prove that it is not\r\nthe intellect of the country that breeds insanity, but its ignorance, as\r\nit cannot be for one moment contended that the grent movements now taking\r\nplace in the world originate with the labouring classes. We shall be told,\r\nwe know, that there is a constant descent of patients from private asylums\r\nto the public asylums; that the professional man and the tradesman, after\r\nexpending the means of his friends and family for a year or two, in the\r\nvain hope of a speedy cure, becomes necessarily in the end a pauper\r\nlunatic, and that this stream aids to swell the numbers in the county\r\ninstitution. Allowing its due weight to this explanation--and those who\r\nknow public asylums are well aware how small, comparatively speaking, is\r\nthe educated element--yet as the same disturbing element in the\r\ncalculation obtained at both periods, we may safely conclude that the\r\nfigures are not thereby essentially altered.\r\n\r\nA still more convincing proof that mental ruin springs rather from mental\r\ntorpidity than from mental stimulation, is to be found by comparing the\r\nproportion of lunatics to the population in the rural and the\r\nmanufacturing districts. Sir Andrew Halliday, who worked out this\r\ninteresting problem in 1828,[20] selected as his twelve non-agricultural\r\ncounties--Cornwall, Cheshire, Derby, Durham, Gloucester, Lancaster,\r\nNorthumberland, Stafford, Somerset, York (West Riding), and Warwick, which\r\ncontained a population at that time of 4,493,194, and a total number of\r\n3,910 insane persons, or one to every 1,200. His twelve agricultural\r\ncounties were Bedford, Berkshire, Bucks, Cambridge, Hereford, Lincoln,\r\nNorfolk, Northampton, Oxford, Rutland, Suffolk, and Wilts, the total\r\npopulation of which were 2,012,979, and the total number of insane persons\r\n2,526--a proportion of 1 lunatic to every 820 sane. Another significant\r\nfact elicited was, that whilst in the manufacturing counties the idiots\r\nwere considerably less than the lunatics, in the rural counties the idiots\r\nwere to the lunatics as 7 to 5! Thus the Hodges of England who know\r\nnothing of the march of intellect, who are entirely guiltless of\r\nspeculations of any kind, contribute far more inmates to the public\r\nlunatic asylums than the toil-worn artisans of Manchester or Liverpool,\r\nwho live in the great eye of the world, and keep step with the march of\r\ncivilization, even if they do but bring up its rear. Isolation is a\r\ngreater cause of mental ruin than aggregation--our English fields can\r\nafford _crétins_ as plentifully as the upland valleys of the mountain\r\nrange, seldom visited by the foot of the traveller; whilst, on the other\r\nhand, in the workshop and the public assembly, \"As iron weareth iron, so\r\nman sharpeneth the face of his friend.\"\r\n\r\nIf we required further proof of the groundless nature of the alarm that\r\nmental activity was destroying the national mind, we should find it in the\r\nwell-ascertained fact that the proportion of lunatics is greater among\r\nfemales than males. It may also be urged that Quakers, who pride\r\nthemselves on the sedateness of their conduct, furnish much more than\r\ntheir share; but for this singular result their system of intermarriage is\r\ndoubtless much to blame. Still the fact remains, that within a period of\r\neight years, extending from 1847 to 1855, an increase of 64 per cent. took\r\nplace in our pauper lunatic asylums. These figures, however, afford no\r\nmore proof of the increase of pauper lunatics than the increase of\r\ncriminal convictions since the introduction of a milder code of laws and\r\nthe appointment of the new police afford a proof of increased crime. As\r\nthe commissioners very justly observe, medical practitioners of late years\r\nhave taken a far more comprehensive as well as scientific view of insanity\r\nthan formerly; and many forms of the disease now fall under their care\r\nthat were previously overlooked, when no man was considered mad unless he\r\nraved, or was an idiot. But the great cause of the increase of lunatics in\r\nour asylums is to be ascribed to the erection of the asylums themselves.\r\nWith the exception of three or four Welsh counties, and two or three in\r\nthe north of England, there is not a shire in England which does not\r\npossess some palatial building. These establishments, in which restraint,\r\nspeaking in the ordinary acceptance of the term, is unknown, and in which\r\nthe inmates are always treated with humanity, have drained the land of a\r\nlunatic population which before was scattered among villages or\r\nworkhouses, amounting, according to the computation of the commissioners,\r\nto upwards of 10,500--just as the deep wells of the metropolitan brewers\r\nhave drained for miles around the shallow wells of the neighbourhood in\r\nwhich they are situated. For the same reason the number of lunatic paupers\r\nhas declined in registered hospitals since 1847 from 384 to 185, and in\r\n\"licensed houses\" from 3,996 to 2,313. Upon the whole, we may safely\r\npredict that, when these disturbing causes have ceased to act, the annual\r\nreturns of the commissioners will show that, as the treatment of insanity\r\nis every day better understood, so the pauper lunatics in our public\r\nasylums, instead of increasing in a ratio for beyond that of the general\r\npopulation, show a diminished proportion. Already there are symptoms that\r\nthe flood is returning to its proper level; for while the lunatics of all\r\nclasses in the public asylums, licensed houses, and in the Royal Hospital\r\nat Haslar, were 20,493 in 1855, they had only advanced in 1856 to 20,764,\r\nwhich is an increase in the twelvemonth of but 271.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON COMMISSARIAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, early on a summer morning before the smoke of countless fires had\r\nnarrowed the horizon of the metropolis, a spectator were to ascend to the\r\ntop of St. Paul's, and take his stand upon the balcony, that with gilded\r\nrail flashes like a fringe of fire upon the summit of the dome, he would\r\nsee sleeping beneath his feet the greatest camp of men upon which the sun\r\nhas ever risen. As far as he could distinguish by the morning light he\r\nwould behold stretched before him the mighty map of the metropolis; and\r\ncould he ascend still higher, he would note the stream of life overflowing\r\nthe brim of hills which enclose the basin in which it stands.\r\n\r\nIn the space swept by his vision would lie the congregated habitations of\r\ntwo millions and a half of his species--but how vain are figures to convey\r\nan idea of so immense a multitude. If Norway, stretching from the Frozen\r\nOcean down to the southern extremity of the North Sea, were to summon all\r\nits people to one vast conclave, they would number little more than half\r\nthe souls within the London bills of mortality. Switzerland, in her\r\nthousand valleys, could not muster such an army; and even busy Holland,\r\nwithin her mast-thronged harbours, humming cities, and populous plains,\r\ncould barely overmatch the close-packed millions within sound of the great\r\nbell at his feet. As the spectator gazed upon this extraordinary prospect,\r\nthe first stir of the awakening city would gradually steal upon his ear.\r\nThe rumbling of wheels, the clang of hammers, the clear call of the human\r\nvoice, all deepening by degrees into a confused hum, would proclaim that\r\nthe mighty city was once more rousing to the labour of the day, and the\r\nblue columns of smoke climbing up to heaven that the morning meal was at\r\nhand. At such a moment the thought would naturally arise in his mind,--In\r\nwhat manner is such an assemblage victualled? By what complicated wheels\r\ndoes all the machinery move by which two millions and a half of human\r\nbeings sit down day by day to their meals as regularly and quietly as\r\nthough they only formed a sung little party at Lovegrove's on a summer's\r\nafternoon? As thus he mused respecting the means by which the supply and\r\ndemand of so vast a multitude is brought to agree, so that every one is\r\nenabled to procure exactly what he wants, at the exact time without loss\r\nto himself or injury to the community, thin lines of steam, sharply marked\r\nfor the moment, as they advanced one after another from the horizon and\r\nconverged towards him would indicate the arrival of the great commissariat\r\ntrains, stored with produce from all parts of these isles and from the\r\nadjacent continent. Could his eye distinguish in addition the fine threads\r\nof that far-spreading web which makes London the most sensitive spot on\r\nthe earth, he would be enabled to take in at a glance the two\r\nagents--steam and electricity--which keep the balance true between the\r\nwants and the supply of London.\r\n\r\nIf our spectator will now descend from his giddy height, and will\r\naccompany us among the busy haunts of men, we will attempt to point out to\r\nhim whence those innumerable commodities, which he has seen pouring into\r\nthe town, have been obtained, the chief marts to which they are consigned,\r\nand the manner in which they are distributed from house to house. Had\r\nLondon like Paris its _octroi_, the difficulty of our task would be\r\nlimited to the mere display of official figures, but, thanks to a free\r\npolicy, we have no such means of getting at strictly accurate estimates,\r\nand must therefore content ourselves with the results of patient inquiry\r\namong the foremost carriers--the railway companies--aided by such other\r\ninformation as we have been able to procure. For the sake of convenience,\r\nand of sequence, let us imagine that the principal daily meal is\r\nproceeding, and, according to the order of the courses, we will endeavour\r\nto trace the various edibles to their source--the fish to its sea--the\r\nbeast to its pasture--the wild animal to its lair--the game to its\r\ncover--and the fruit to its orchard; to point out how they are netted,\r\nfattened, bagged, gathered, and conveyed to their ultimate\r\ndestination--the _great red lane_ of London humanity. Let us begin with\r\nfish, and that unrivalled fish-market which all the world is aware rears\r\nits head by London Bridge.\r\n\r\nThose who remember old Billingsgate, with its tumble-down wharf, and dock\r\nhalf choked with corruption and oyster-shells--a dirty remnant of the days\r\nof Elizabeth--will enter with pleasure Mr. Bunning's new market. Through\r\nits Italian colonnade are seen the masts of the fishing smacks, and the\r\nbrown wharves of the opposite side--a pleasing picture, which instantly\r\nfixes the artistic eye. The busy scene within the market between the hours\r\nof five and seven in the morning, is one of the marvels of the metropolis.\r\nBillingsgate is the only wholesale fish-market in London, and it may\r\ntherefore be imagined how great must be the business transacted within its\r\nwalls. Of old, nine-tenths of the supply came by way of the river, the\r\nlittle that came by land being conveyed from the coast, at great expense,\r\nin four-horse vans. Now the railways are day by day supplanting smacks,\r\nand in many cases steamers; for by means of its iron arms, London, whilst\r\nits millions slumber, grasps the produce of every sea that beats against\r\nour island coast, and ere they have uprisen it is drawn to a focus in this\r\ncentral mart. Thus every night in the season the hardy fishermen of\r\nYarmouth catch a hundred tons (12,081 yearly), principally herring, which,\r\nby means of the Eastern Counties Railway, are next morning at\r\nBillingsgate. The South-Western Railway sends up annually, with the same\r\nspeed, 4,000 tons of mackerel and other fish, the gatherings of the south\r\ncoast. The North Western collects over night the \"catch\" from Ireland,\r\nScotland, and the north-east coast of England, and adds to the\r\nThames-street mart 3,578 tons, principally of salmon, whilst the Great\r\nNorthern delivers to the early morning market, or sometimes later in the\r\nday, 3,248 tons of like sea produce. The Great Western brings up the\r\nharvest of the Cornish and Devonshire coasts, chiefly mackerel and\r\npilchards, to the amount of 1,560 tons in the year; and the Brighton and\r\nSouth Coast conveys the incredible number of 15,000 bushels of oysters,\r\nbesides 4,000 tons of other fish. Nearly one-half in fact of the\r\nfish-supply of London, instead of following as of old the tedious route of\r\nthe coast, is hurried in the dead of night across the length and breadth\r\nof the land to Billingsgate, and, before the large consumers in Tyburnia\r\nand Belgravia have left their beds, may be seen either lying on the marble\r\nslabs of the fishmongers, or penetrating on the peripatetic barrow of the\r\ncostermonger into the dismal lanes and alleys inhabited by \"London Labour\r\nand the London Poor.\" These prodigious gleanings from what Goldsmith might\r\nwell call the \"finny deep,\" are conveyed from the termini in spring-vans,\r\ndrawn by two and occasionally by four horses. Salmon comes in boxes,\r\nherrings in barrels, and all other kinds of fish in baskets. Sometimes as\r\nmany as sixty of these vans will arrive in the narrow street leading to\r\nthe market in the course of two or three hours, and the scene of confusion\r\noccasioned by their rushing among the fishmongers' carts and the\r\ncostermongers' barrows, the latter often amounting to more than a\r\nthousand, is almost as great as that at Smithfield; for the fish, like the\r\nlive-stock trade, has long outgrown its mart: and Billingsgate, as much as\r\nSmithfield, is choked for want of space. Let the visitor beware how he\r\nenters it in a good coat, for, as sure as he goes in in broad cloth, he\r\nwill come out in _scale_ armour. They are not polite at Billingsgate, as\r\nall the world knows, and \"by your leave\" is only a preliminary to your hat\r\nbeing knocked off your head by a bushel of oysters or a basket of crabs.\r\nIn the early part of the morning, the traffic is carried on in comparative\r\nquiet, for the regular fishmongers, who have the first of the market,\r\nconduct their business with little disturbance, but it would gladden the\r\nheart of a Dutch painter to see the piled produce of a dozen different\r\nseas glittering with silver and brilliant with colour. Gigantic salmon,\r\nfresh caught from the firths and bays of Scotland, or from the productive\r\nIrish seas, flounder about, as the boxes in which they have travelled\r\ndisgorge them upon the board. Quantities of delicate red mullet, that have\r\nbeen hurried up by the Great Western, all the way from Cornwall, for the\r\npurpose of being furnished fresh to the fastidious palates at the West\r\nEnd; smelts brought by the Dutch boats, their delicate skins varying in\r\nhue like an opal as you pass; pyramids of lobsters, a moving mass of\r\nspiteful claws and restless feelers, savage at their late abduction from\r\nsome Norwegian fiord; great heaps of pinky shrimps; turbots, that lately\r\nfattened upon the Doggerbank, with their white bellies bent as for some\r\ntremendous leap; and humbler plaice and dabs, from our own craft--all this\r\nbountiful accumulation forms a mingled scene of strange forms and vivid\r\ncolours, that no one with an eye for the picturesque can contemplate\r\nwithout interest. Neither is the scene always one of still life, for it is\r\nno rare occurrence for the visitor to behold a yelling knot of men\r\ndragging with ropes through the excited crowd a royal sturgeon, nine feet\r\nin length. If the spectator now peeps down the large square opening into\r\nthe dismal space below, which appears like the hold of a ship lately\r\nrecovered from the deep, he will see the shell-fish market, where piles of\r\nblue-black muscles, whelks, and grey cockles turned up with yellow, give\r\nthe place a repulsive aspect of dirt and slop. There are but few buyers\r\nseen here, and they are generally women belonging to the costermonger\r\nclass, for the men rather disdain the shell-fish trade. These female\r\nitinerants may be noticed wandering about from basket to basket,\r\noccasionally gouging out a whelk from the shell with the thumb, to test\r\nthe lot, and then passing on to the next.\r\n\r\nBusiest among the busy is seen the \"Bommeree,\" or middleman--sometimes\r\ncalled the forestaller. The province of this individual is to purchase the\r\nfish as it comes into the market, and divide it into lots to suit large\r\nand small buyers, separating the qualities according as they are designed\r\nfor St. James's or St. Giles's. These worthies used at one time to\r\nforestal the market extensively, when they felt certain, from the state\r\nof the tide, that no fish supplies could be poured in for the day, but now\r\nthe railway defeats their tactics, and the utter uncertainty of the\r\narrivals has done away with this branch of their business. After the\r\n\"trade\" has been supplied, and the serge-aproned \"regulars\" have loaded\r\ntheir light spring carts, there comes, especially in certain fish seasons,\r\nan eruption of purchasers of a totally different character--the\r\ncostermongers of streets. This nomade tribe, which wanders in thousands\r\nfrom market to market, performs a most important part in the distribution\r\nof food. They are for the greater part the tradesmen of the poor, and by\r\ntheir energy and enterprise secure to our working-classes many of the\r\nfruits of both sea and land, which they would never taste but for them.\r\nAbout seven o'clock the army of street-vendors, foot and \"donkey,\" for the\r\ngreater number rattle up in barrows drawn by that useful animal, begin\r\nvisibly to change the whole hue and appearance of the place. Young fellows\r\nin fustian coats and Belcher handkerchiefs throng the market, and board\r\nthe smacks, \"chaffing,\" higgling, joking, and swearing--but never\r\nfighting, for the costermonger has too much to do at present to make\r\nphysical demonstrations. Among the most eager of the itinerant salesmen\r\nthe visitor speedily distinguishes the Judaic nose. The Hebrews, who are\r\nin great force about this neighbourhood on account of the dried-fruit\r\ntrade, which is mainly in their hands, deal largely also in fish. The\r\npoorer members of the fraternity purchase the bigger portion of the\r\nfresh-water supply, such as plaice, roach, dace, &c., in fact, nearly\r\neverything caught by the Wandsworth fisherman, whose picturesque \"bawley\"\r\nboats, which often contain both his family and fortune, may generally be\r\nseen moored in the stream between Battersea reach and Kew bridge, a mass\r\nof brown nets and umber canopies lit up by the brilliant red caps of their\r\nowners, just such as Constable loved to paint in the foregrounds of his\r\nlandscapes. These fish, if not alive, must at least retain the spasmodic\r\nquivering of the flesh which remains immediately after death, or the Jews\r\nwill not buy, for reasons we suppose connected with their religion, since\r\ntheir chief trade is among the rich and poor of their own people. The\r\nWandsworth fishermen also supply all the white-bait that is consumed at\r\nGreenwich and Blackwall: it is caught generally between the latter place\r\nand Woolwich at night, and it is singular that a fish which is among the\r\nmost delicate we have, should flourish in one of the foulest parts of the\r\nfoulest river in Europe. The area of the market, as soon as the\r\ncostermongers appear, speedily becomes broken up into numbers of little\r\ncircles, strictly intent upon the eye of individuals who take up a\r\nposition high over their heads upon the boards or stands. These are the\r\nsalesmen, disposing by auction of the fish consigned to them. Some of the\r\ndealers are moneyed men, and will lay out their fifty pounds of a morning,\r\nre-selling to their fellows again at a profit. The smaller capitalists\r\ncombine in threes and fours, and thus manage to get their commodities at\r\nwholesale prices. The activity of the market mainly depends upon the\r\nseason of the year and the amount of fish. The energy of these\r\nperipatetics is surprising: they look in at Billingsgate, and if the\r\nsupply runs short they are off again immediately to Covent Garden, for\r\nthey deal in everything, and the barrow that one morning you see filled\r\nwith fresh herrings, the next is blooming with plums. If, on the contrary,\r\na large cargo of sprats comes suddenly into London, or if soles should be\r\nunusually plentiful, it is known in an incredibly short space of time all\r\nover the town, and they flock to the market in thousands; as many as five\r\nthousand is the usual attendance on such occasions. These costermongers\r\nabsorb more than a third of the whole Billingsgate supply; of sprats and\r\nfresh herrings they take fully two-thirds. Turbot and all the costlier\r\nfish they purchase sparingly, but they buy largely when it chances to be\r\ncheap, as in the cholera year of 1849, when prime salmon went a-begging at\r\nfour-pence a pound! If the market is dull, and prices are high, the fact\r\nis speedily known, and the cry of \"No smacks at the Gate,\" is sufficient\r\nto turn the current immediately in the direction of the \"Garden.\"\r\n\r\nSteam, as we have already intimated, has revolutionized the fish-trade,\r\nand is rapidly sweeping away the whole fleet of smacks propelled by sails,\r\nas ruthlessly as the rail did stagecoaches. A few years ago all the\r\noysters were brought by water to Billingsgate; but a short time since a\r\ngreat natural bed, called the Mid Channel Bed, which stretches for forty\r\nmiles between the ports of Shoreham and Havre, was discovered, and, the\r\ndredging-ground being free to all comers, a vast field of wealth has been\r\nopened to fishermen, especially as from the proximity of the Brighton and\r\nSouth Coast Railway the produce can be sent immediately to town, and\r\nescape the dues of metage and other tolls to which all fish landed at the\r\nmarket is liable. Seaborne oysters are thus placed at a great\r\ndisadvantage, and the different companies owning them justly complain at a\r\ncity exaction which takes a large sum annually out of their pockets,\r\nbesides the charge for porterage it entails upon the purchasers. Mr.\r\nAlston, who is, without doubt, the largest oyster-fisher in the world,\r\nsent up in one year between 40,000 and 50,000 bushels from his fishery,\r\nCheyney Rock, near Sheerness, and paid 800_l._ for metage. The whole trade\r\npaid no less than 3,000_l._, and this for services which their own men\r\ncould do as well as themselves, were it not for a custom which enforces\r\nidleness upon the smack people.[21]\r\n\r\nThe \"scuttle-mouths,\" as they are termed from their huge shell, pay no\r\nattention to season, and consequently oyster-day has now in a great degree\r\nlost its significance. The 4th of August is still, it is true, the opening\r\nday at Billingsgate, but the supply from without has taken the wind out of\r\nits sails. Only those who have witnessed the crowds filling all the\r\nstreets leading to the market long before the hour of business--six\r\no'clock in the morning--can understand the eagerness exhibited of old to\r\nobtain some of the first day's oysters. All this is now gone. There were\r\nnot more than eighteen smacks at the opening of the present year, and, few\r\nas were the arrivals, the buyers were not eager. The Mid-Channel oysters,\r\nwhich have thus disturbed the old trade, are of a large and by no means\r\ndelicate kind, such as come from Tenby, Jersey, &c.--coarse fish, eaten by\r\nrough men--third-class oysters, in fact, which rarely penetrate to the\r\nWest End, unless to make sauce. Real natives are greater aristocrats among\r\ntheir fellows than ever; the demand for them has for a long time far\r\nexceeded the supply, and the price has consequently risen. Of the birth,\r\nparentage and nurture of this delicate fish, a curious tale could be told.\r\nDesigned for fastidious palates, much care and attention is bestowed upon\r\nits breeding. The _habitué_ of the Opera, who strolls up the brilliantly\r\nlighted Haymarket towards midnight, and turns into any one of the fish\r\nsupper-rooms that line its western side, little dreams of the organization\r\nat work to enable him to enjoy his native. Most of the oysters, with the\r\nexception of the Mid-Channel bed, are regularly cultivated by different\r\ncompanies, who rear and tend them at different parts of the south coast,\r\nand of the Thames at its mouth. Of these companies there are nine, in\r\naddition to individuals who possess and work what might be called\r\nsea-farms, several of which are miles in extent. In all the beds there is\r\na certain space dedicated to natives. At Burnham, Essex, the \"spat,\" or\r\nfecundated sperm, is stored in large pits, and sold as native brood, which\r\nis afterwards \"laid\" in that portion of the different beds appropriated to\r\nprivileged oysters. Here the young natives remain for three years, when\r\nthey are generally brought to market. So far their education is left, in a\r\ncertain degree, to nature; but once in the possession of the\r\nfish-shopkeepers, art steps in to perfect their condition. They are now\r\nstored in large shallow vats, being carefully laid with their proper sides\r\nuppermost, and supplied daily with oatmeal: a process which is calculated\r\nrather to fatten than to flavour, and there are many who think that, like\r\nshow cattle, they are none the better for over-feeding. \"Natives,\" packed\r\nin barrels, form one of the articles of food that is largely sent out of\r\nLondon into the country, as all persons know who travel much at Christmas\r\ntime, and notice with astonishment the pyramids of oyster-barrels which\r\ncrowd the platforms of all the termini of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe frying-pans of London are mainly supplied with soles all the year\r\nround by the trolling-boats of Barking, of which there are upwards of 150\r\nbelonging to different companies. They fish the North Sea off the coasts\r\nof Yorkshire and Holland, particularly the Silver and Brown banks. Of old\r\nthe smacks used to carry their own catch to Billingsgate, but the loss of\r\ntime was so great, that latterly fast-sailing cutters have been employed\r\nto attend upon the fishing-smacks and bring their produce to market packed\r\nin ice. Of this splendid craft, which can sail almost in the eye of the\r\nwind, there are forty; and the total number of seamen employed is not less\r\nthan 2,000, the greater part of whom have been taken as boys from the\r\nworkhouse, and trained by this capital service into first-rate seamen. It\r\nis curious to follow the small proceedings of the world into their\r\nultimate results. The gastronome, smiling complacently as he withdraws the\r\ncover and reveals a well-browned pair of soles, would never guess that\r\nthey and their kind are the immediate cause of a happy transmutation of\r\nparish burthens into the right arm of our strength. Eels are constantly\r\nimported to Billingsgate by the Dutch boats. The galliots never moor close\r\nalongside the wharf, as the wells in which they bring their fish alive\r\ncause them to draw too much water, but they anchor midway in the stream,\r\nby twos and threes--their brown sides, flat bows, with high cheek-bones,\r\nlike their navigators, and bright verd-green rudders, adding to the\r\npicturesque appearance of the river. The great fat creatures brought by\r\nthem mainly supply the eel-pie houses, and contribute largely, we are\r\ninformed, to that oleaginous kind of soup which people too hungry to be\r\ncurious mistake for veritable oxtail and calves' head. The Dutch boats do\r\nnot, however, confine themselves to eels. They deal in turbot, soles, and\r\nall kinds of flat-fish, such as frequent the Dogger Bank, much to the\r\ndiscredit of our native enterprise, neglecting, as we do, the splendid\r\ndeep-sea fishing-ground off the south-west coast of Ireland, where cod and\r\nsalmon are to be found in abundant quantities, whilst those who know the\r\nwest coast well, declare there is turbot enough in Galway Bay \"to supply\r\nthe whole of Europe for the next hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe, however, it is now in contemplation to go to work upon a large\r\nscale in those waters, having screw-steamers to collect the produce, and\r\nbring it to Milford Haven alive in wells, from which port it would come,\r\n_viâ_ the South Wales and Great Western Railways, to Billingsgate, within\r\ntwenty-four hours after it was caught. The value of screw steamers having\r\ncapacious wells has been fully tested by Mr. Howard, of Manningtree,\r\nEssex, who fitted an engine and screw into one of his welled\r\nfishing-smacks. Scarcely a lobster, out of twenty thousand put alive into\r\nthe boat, was lost, whilst large numbers of those brought in sailing\r\nsmacks perish. Salmon, cod, and other fish, are brought alive with the\r\nsame success in the welled steamers from the North Sea and the coast of\r\nScotland. It is almost time that some new ground were found in place of\r\nthe famous Dogger Bank, which has now been preyed upon by so many nations\r\nfor centuries, and has supplied so many generations of Catholics and\r\nProtestants with fast and feast food. No better proof that its stores are\r\nfailing could be given than the fact that, although the ground, counting\r\nthe Long Bank and the north-west flat in its vicinity, covers 11,800\r\nsquare miles, and that in fine weather it is fished by the London\r\ncompanies with from fifteen to twenty dozen of long lines, extending to\r\nten or twelve miles, and containing from 9,000 to 12,000 hooks, it is yet\r\nnot at all common to secure even as many as four score fish of a night--a\r\npoverty which can be better appreciated when we learn that 600 fish for\r\n800 hooks is the catch for deep-sea fishing about Kinsale.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of August the great herring season commences.\r\nYarmouth is the chief seat of this branch of the piscatory trade. Every\r\nnight when the weather is fine the fishermen of this old port \"shoot\"\r\nupwards of 300 square miles of net. Neptune in his ample arms never gave\r\nthe ocean so magnificent an embrace. The produce of this wholesale\r\nsweeping of the sea is brought to town by the Eastern Counties Railway.\r\nThey come up to Billingsgate packed in barrels and in bulk, and the number\r\nsold in the year seems almost fabulous, being upwards of a _billion_. Next\r\nto the herring fishery the sea-harvest of most importance to the poor of\r\nLondon is that of sprats, which come in about Lord Mayor's Day, and it is\r\na popular belief that the first dish is always sent to the chief\r\nmagistrate of the city. If a telegraph were to be laid down to all the\r\nalleys and courts, the fact of a large arrival of these little creatures\r\nat Billingsgate would not be sooner made known to the lower orders than,\r\nby some mysterious process, it is at present. Mr. Goldham, the clerk of\r\nthe market, accustomed as he is to the sudden invasions of the\r\ncostermongers, informs us that the scene on board the smacks laden with\r\nsprats is really frightful. The people hang thick as sea-weed from the\r\nrigging, throng the decks, and swarm on every available inch of plank,\r\nuntil the wonder is that the whole of the puny fleet does not capsize with\r\nthe weight. The cause of the scramble is that the street sellers will not\r\nbuy until they have seen the sample, and every one consequently tries to\r\ngain the highest point, that he may look down into the hold, whilst a man\r\ntumbles about the sprats with a shovel, in silver showers. The plaice\r\nseason succeeds to that of sprats, with the interval of mackerel, which\r\ncontinues until the end of May, when Scotland and Ireland begin to pass\r\ndown their salmon into the market. But where do all the lobsters come\r\nfrom? The lovers of this most delicious of the crustaceæ tribe will\r\nprobably be astonished to learn that they are mainly brought from Norway.\r\nFrance and the Channel Islands, Orkney, and Shetland, do, it is true,\r\ncontribute a few to the metropolitan market, but full two-thirds are\r\nreluctantly, and with much pinching and twisting, dragged out of the\r\nthousand rock-bound inlets which indent the Norwegian coast. They are\r\nconveyed alive in a screw-steamer and by smacks, in baskets, sometimes to\r\nthe extent of 20,000 of a night, to Great Grimsby, and are thence\r\nforwarded to town by the Great Northern Railway--another 10,000 arriving\r\nperhaps from points on our own and the French coast. The fighting,\r\ntwisting, blue-black masses are taken as soon as purchased to what are\r\ntermed the \"boiling-houses,\" of which there are four, situated in Duck and\r\nLove Lanes, close to the market; and here, for a trifling sum per score,\r\nthey change their dark for scarlet uniforms. They are plunged into the\r\nboiling cauldron, basket and all, and in twenty minutes they are done.\r\nCrabs are cooked in the same establishments, but their nervous systems are\r\nso acute, that they dash off their claws in convulsive agony if placed\r\nalive in hot water. To prevent this mutilation, which would spoil their\r\nsale, they are first killed by the insertion of a needle through the head.\r\nThe lobster trade is mostly in the hands of one salesman, Mr. Saunders, of\r\nThames Street, who often has upwards of 15,000 consigned to him of a\r\nmorning, and who causes no less than 15,000_l._ a year to flow into the\r\nfishy palms of Norwegians for this single article of commerce. As to the\r\ntotal supply of fish to the London market, we borrow the following\r\nestimate from Mr. Mayhew's very clever book on \"London Labour and the\r\nLondon Poor.\" The figures seemed to us at first sight so enormous, that we\r\nhesitatingly submitted the table to one of the largest salesmen who\r\nassured us that it was no over-statement:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |         Description of Fish.           | No. of Fish.| Weight of Fish.|\r\n  |----------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|\r\n  |             WET FISH.                  |             |                |\r\n  |                                        |             |      lbs.      |\r\n  |Salmon and salmon trout (29,000 boxes,} |             |                |\r\n  |  14 fish per box)                    } |      406,000|     3,480,000  |\r\n  |Live cod (averaging 10 lbs. each)       |      400,000|     4,000,000  |\r\n  |Soles (averaging 1/4 lb. each)          |   97,520,000|    26,880,000  |\r\n  |Whiting (averaging 6 oz. each)          |   17,920,000|     6,720,000  |\r\n  |Haddock (averaging 2 lbs. each)         |    2,470,000|     5,040,000  |\r\n  |Plaice (averaging 1 lb. each)           |   33,600,000|    33,600,000  |\r\n  |Mackerel (averaging 1 lb. each)         |   23,520,000|    23,520,000  |\r\n  |Fresh herrings (250,000 barrels, 700  } |             |                |\r\n  |  fish per barrel)                    } |  175,000,000|    42,000,000  |\r\n  |Ditto in bulk                           |1,050,000,000|   252,000,000  |\r\n  |Sprats                                  |             |     4,000,000  |\r\n  |Eels from Holland (principally),       }|             |{    1,505,280  |\r\n  |  England, and Ireland (6 fish per lb.)}|   9,797,760 |{      127,680  |\r\n  |Flounders (7,200 qrtns., 36 fish per   }|             |                |\r\n  |  qtn.)                                }|     259,200 |        43,200  |\r\n  |Dabs (7,500 qrtns., 36 fish per qrtn.)  |     270,000 |        48,750  |\r\n  |                                        |             |                |\r\n  |            DRY FISH.                   |             |                |\r\n  |                                        |             |                |\r\n  |Barrelled cod (15,000 barrels, 40 fish }|             |                |\r\n  |  per barrel)                          }|     750,000 |     4,200,000  |\r\n  |Dried salt cod (5 lbs. each)            |   1,600,000 |     8,000,000  |\r\n  |Smoked haddock (65,000 barrels, 300    }|             |                |\r\n  |  fish per barrel)                     }|  19,500,000 |    10,920,000  |\r\n  |Bloaters (265,000 baskets, 150 fish per}|             |                |\r\n  |  basket)                              }| 147,000,000 |    10,600,000  |\r\n  |Red herrings (100,000 barrels, 500 fish}|             |                |\r\n  |  per barrel)                          }|  50,000,000 |    14,000,000  |\r\n  |Dried sprats (9,600 large bundles, 30  }|             |                |\r\n  |fish per bundle)                       }|      288,000|        96,000  |\r\n  |                                        |             |                |\r\n  |          SHELL FISH.                   |             |                |\r\n  |                                        |             |                |\r\n  |Oysters                                 | 495,896,000 |                |\r\n  |Lobsters (averaging 1 lb. each fish)    |   1,200,000 |     1,200,000  |\r\n  |Crabs (averaging 1 lb. each fish)       |     600,000 |       600,000  |\r\n  |Shrimps (324 to a pint)                 | 498,428,648 |                |\r\n  |Whelks (227 to half bushel)             |   4,943,200 |                |\r\n  |Mussels (1,000 to half bushel)          |  50,400,000 |                |\r\n  |Cockles (2,000 to half bushel)          |  67,392,000 |                |\r\n  |Periwinkles (4,000 to half bushel)      | 304,000,000 |                |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nAnd now for the _pièce de résistance_.\r\n\r\nLondon has always been celebrated for the excellence of its meat, and her\r\nsons do justice to it; at least it has become the universal impression\r\nthat they consume more, man for man, than any other town population in the\r\nworld. It was a sirloin, fresh and ruddy, hanging at the door of some\r\nGiblett or Slater in a former century, that inspired, we suspect, the song\r\nwhich ever since has stirred Englishmen in a foreign land, \"The Roast Beef\r\nof Old England.\" The visitor accustomed to the markets of our large\r\nprovincial towns would doubtless expect to find the emporium of the\r\nlive-stock trade for so vast a population of an imposing size. The\r\nforeigner, after seeing the magnificence of our docks--the solidity and\r\nspan of our bridges--might naturally look for a national exposition of our\r\ngreatness in the chief market dedicated to that British beef which is the\r\nboast of John Bull. What they do see in reality, if they have courage to\r\nwend their way along any of the narrow tumble-down streets approaching to\r\nSmithfield, which the great fire unfortunately spared, is an irregular\r\nspace bounded by dirty houses and the ragged party-walls of demolished\r\nhabitations, which give it the appearance of the site of a recent\r\nconflagration--the whole space comprising just six acres, fifteen perches,\r\nroads and public thoroughfares included. Into this narrow area, surrounded\r\nwith slaughter-houses, triperies, bone-boiling houses, gut-scraperies,\r\n&c., the mutton-chops, scrags, saddles, legs, sirloins, and rounds, which\r\ngrace the smiling boards of our noble imperial capital throughout the\r\nyear, have, for the major part, been goaded and contused for the benefit\r\nof the civic corporation installed at Guildhall.[22] The best time is\r\nearly in the morning--say one or two o'clock of the \"great day,\" as the\r\nlast market before Christmas-day is called. On this occasion, not only the\r\nspace--calculated to hold 4,100 oxen and 30,000 sheep, besides calves and\r\npigs--is crammed, but the approaches around it overflow with live stock\r\nfor many hundred feet, and sometimes the cattle are seen blocking up the\r\npassage as far as St. Sepulchre's church. If the stranger can make his way\r\nthrough the crowd, and by means of some vantage-ground or door-step can\r\nmanage to raise himself a few feet above the general level, he sees before\r\nhim in one direction, by the dim red light of hundreds of torches, a\r\nwrithing party-coloured mass, surmounted by twisting horns, some in rows,\r\ntied to rails which run along the whole length of the open space, some\r\ngathered together in one struggling knot. In another quarter, the moving\r\ntorches reveal to him now and then, through the misty light, a couple of\r\nacres of living wool, or roods of pigs' skins. If he ventures into this\r\nclosely wedged and labouring mass, he is enabled to watch more narrowly\r\nthe reason of the universal ferment among the beasts.\r\n\r\nThe drover with his goad is forcing the cattle into the smallest possible\r\ncompass, and a little further on half a dozen men are making desperate\r\nefforts to drag refractory oxen up to the rails with ropes. In the scuffle\r\nwhich ensues the slipping of the ropes often snaps the fingers of the\r\npersons who are conducting the operation, and there is scarce a drover in\r\nthe market who has not had some of his digits broken. The sheep, squeezed\r\ninto hurdles like figs into a drum, lie down upon each other, \"and make no\r\nsign;\" the pigs, on the other hand, cry out before they are hurt. This\r\nscene, which has more the appearance of a hideous nightmare than a weekly\r\nexhibition in a civilised country, is accompanied by the barking of dogs,\r\nthe bellowing of cattle, the cursing of men, and the dull blows of\r\nsticks--a charivari of sound that must be heard to be appreciated. The\r\nhubbub gradually abates from twelve o'clock at night, the time of opening,\r\nto its close at 3 P.M. next day; although during the whole period, as\r\nfresh lots are \"headed up,\" individual acts of cruelty continue. Can it\r\nexcite surprise that a state of things, the worst details of which we have\r\nsuppressed, because of the pain which such horrors excite, sometimes so\r\ninjures the stock that, to quote the words of one of the witnesses before\r\nthe Smithfield Commission, \"a grazier will not know his own beast four\r\ndays after it has left him?\" The meat itself suffers in quality; for\r\nanything like fright or passion is well known to affect the blood, and\r\nconsequently the flesh. Beasts subjected to such disturbances will often\r\nturn green within twenty-four hours after death. Mr. Slater, the\r\nwell-known butcher of Kensington and Jermyn-street, states that mutton is\r\noften so disfigured by blows and the goad, that it cannot be sold for the\r\nWest-end tables. Many of the drovers we doubt not are ruffians, but we\r\nbelieve the greater part of this cruelty is to be ascribed to the\r\nmarket-place itself, which, considering the immense amount of business to\r\nbe got through on Mondays and Fridays, is absurdly and disgracefully\r\nconfined. According to the official account, the number of live stock\r\nexhibited in 1853 was--\r\n\r\n   Oxen.       Sheep.      Calves.    Pigs.       Total.\r\n  294,571    1,518,040     36,791    29,593     1,893,888\r\n\r\nBut this is far from giving a true idea of the whole amount brought into\r\nLondon. Much stock arrives in the capital which never enters the great\r\nmart. For example, Mr. Slater, who kills per week, on the average, 200\r\nsheep and from 20 to 25 oxen, says, in his evidence before the Smithfield\r\nCommission, that he buys a great deal of his stock from the graziers in\r\nNorfolk and Essex. Again, \"town\" pigs are slaughtered and sent direct to\r\nthe meat market, while many sheep are bought from the parks, where they\r\nhave been temporarily placed till they find a purchaser. A much more\r\ncorrect estimate of the flocks and herds which are annually consumed in\r\nLondon may be gathered from a report of the numbers transmitted by the\r\ndifferent lines of railway, compiled from official sources by Mr. Ormandy,\r\nthe cattle-traffic manager of the North-Western Railway. From this able\r\npamphlet we extract the following table:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                           | Oxen. |  Sheep. |Calves.| Pigs. |  Total  |\r\n  |                           |       |         |       |       |for 1853.|\r\n  |                           |-------|---------|-------|-------|---------|\r\n  |By Eastern Counties        | 81,744|  277,735|  3,492| 23,427|  386,398|\r\n  | \" L. & N.

The Eastern Counties lines, penetrating\r\nand monopolizing the rich breeding and fattening districts of Norfolk and\r\nEssex, bring up the largest share. Many of the little black cattle, that\r\ntourists see in Scotland climbing the hills like cats, come directly from\r\nthese counties, having some months before been sent thither from their\r\nnative north to clothe their bones with English substance. By the same\r\nline we receive a fair portion of that great foreign contribution to our\r\nlarders, the mere shadow of which so frightened our graziers some years\r\nago, principally Danish stock, which finds its way from Tonning to\r\nLowestoff, a route newly opened up by the North of Europe Steam-ship\r\nCompany. The North-Western is next in rank as a carrier of live stock.\r\nThis line takes in the contributions from the Midland Counties, and, by\r\nway of Liverpool, abundance of Irish and Scotch cattle. The Great Northern\r\nis perhaps destined to surpass both in the quantities of food it will\r\neventually pour into London, running as it does through the northern\r\nbreeding districts, and receiving at its extremity the herds which come\r\nfrom Aberdeen and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe foreign supply last year of cattle, sheep, pigs, and calves, was more\r\nthan a seventh of the entire number sent to London. The daily bills of\r\nentries at the Custom House furnishes us with a valuable indication of the\r\nfields from which we have already received, and may in future expect to\r\nreceive still further additions of what Englishmen greatly covet--good\r\nbeef and mutton at a moderate price. The arrivals by steam in the port of\r\nLondon in 1853 were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |   _From_        |_Oxen._| _Sheep._ | _Calves._|_Pigs._|_Total._|\r\n  |-----------------|-------|----------|----------|-------|--------|\r\n  |Holland          | 40,538|   172,730|    24,280|  9,370| 246,918|\r\n  |Denmark          |  9,487|     7,515|        60|   ..  |  17,062|\r\n  |Hanseatic Towns  |  4,366|    37,443|         1|    632|  42,442|\r\n  |Belgium          |    449|    12,006|     1,244|   ..  |  13,699|\r\n  |France           |    105|       224|       135|    129|     593|\r\n  |Portugal         |    100|      ..  |      ..  |   ..  |     100|\r\n  |Spain            |     17|      ..  |      ..  |   ..  |      17|\r\n  |Russia           |      3|      ..  |      ..  |   ..  |       3|\r\n  |                 |-------|----------|----------|-------|--------|\r\n  |Total            | 55,065|   229,918|    25,720| 10,131| 320,834|\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nHolland, Denmark, and the Hanseatic Towns, it will be seen, were the\r\nprincipal contributors. A more striking example of the influence of the\r\nlegislation of one country in modifying the occupations of the people of\r\nanother could not be cited, than the manner in which Sir Robert Peel's\r\ntariff revolutionized the character of Danish and Dutch farming. Before\r\n1844 the pastures of the two countries, more especially the rich marshes\r\nof Holland, were almost exclusively devoted to dairy purposes: the\r\nabolition of the duty on live stock in that year quickly introduced a new\r\nstate of things. The farmers began to breed stock, and consequently\r\nturnips and mangel-wurzel have been creeping over fields, where once the\r\ndairy-maid carried the milking-pail, as gradually as one landscape\r\nsucceeds another in the Polytechnic dissolving views. We get now from both\r\ncountries excellent beef, especially from Jutland, whose lowing herds used\r\nformerly to go to Hamburg--and who has not heard of the famous Hambro'\r\nbeef? We may expect in time to receive still finer meat from this quarter,\r\nfor the Danes have been sedulously improving their breed, and\r\nagriculturists, who saw the beasts which were sent over to the last\r\nBaker-street show, admitted that they were in every respect equal to our\r\nown short-horns. It is gratifying to note how ready the world is to follow\r\nour lead in the matter of stock-breeding. Bulls are bought up at fabulous\r\nprices by foreigners, and especially by our cousins on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic, for the purpose of raising the indigenous cattle to the\r\nBritish standard. An American, for instance, purchased, for 1,000_l._, a\r\ncelebrated bull bred by Earl Ducie, though unfortunately the animal broke\r\nhis neck on his passage out. Another noble specimen was secured, we have\r\nheard, for the same quarter, for 600_l._\r\n\r\nThe supply of sheep and lambs has, during the last twenty years, stood\r\nnearly still; for in 1828 there were brought to market 1,412,032, and in\r\n1849 but 1,417,000, or only an extra 4,000 for the 500,000 mouths which\r\nhave been added to the metropolis between these two periods. That London\r\nhas of late years abjured mutton, as our immediate ancestors appear to\r\nhave done pork, the evidence of our senses denies. How, then, are we to\r\nexplain this stagnation in the Smithfield returns? By the fact that a new\r\nchannel has been found in the rapid rise of Newgate market, the great\r\nreceptacle of country-killed meat brought up to town by the railways.\r\nThose who remember the place forty years ago state that there were not\r\nthen twenty salesmen, and now there are two hundred. This enormous\r\ndevelopment is due to steam, which bids fair to give Newgate, in the cold\r\nseason at least, the lead over Smithfield. The new agent has more than\r\nquadrupled the area from which London draws its meat. Twenty years ago\r\neighty miles was the farthest distance from which carcases ever came; now\r\nthe Great Northern and North-Western railways, during the winter months,\r\nbring hundreds of tons from as far north as Aberdeen, whilst some are\r\nfetched from Hamburgh and Ostend. Country slaughtering will in time, we\r\nhave little doubt, deliver the capital from the nuisances which grow out\r\nof this horrible trade. Aberdeen is in fact becoming little else than a\r\nLondon _abattoir_. The style in which the butchers of that place dress and\r\npack the carcases leaves nothing to be desired, and in the course of the\r\nyear mountains of beef, mutton, pork, and veal arrive the night after it\r\nis slaughtered in perfect condition. According to returns obligingly\r\nforwarded to us by the different railway companies, we find that the\r\nfollowing was the weight of country-killed meat by the undermentioned\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n                              Tons.\r\n  Eastern Counties           10,398\r\n  North-Western               4,602\r\n  Great Western               5,200\r\n  Great Northern             13,152[23]\r\n  South-Eastern               1,035\r\n  South-Western               2,000\r\n  Brighton and South Coast      100\r\n                             ------\r\n                             36,487\r\n\r\nThus no less than 36,487 tons of meat are annually \"pitched\" at Newgate\r\nand Leadenhall markets. As the Scotch boats convey about 700 tons more, we\r\nhave at least 37,187 tons of country-killed meat brought into London by\r\nsteam, and these immense contributions are totally independent of the\r\namount slaughtered at Smithfield, which is estimated to average weekly\r\n1,000 oxen, 3,000 sheep and lambs, and 400 calves and pigs. We have given\r\nthe average supply; but on some occasions the quantity is enormously\r\nincreased. The Eastern Counties line during one Christmas week deposited\r\nat Newgate about 1,000 tons of meat; and the weight sent by other\r\ncompanies on the same day would be proportionately large. No less than\r\nforty waggons were waiting on one occasion to discharge their beef and\r\nmutton into the market. And what does our reader imagine may be the area\r\nin which nine-tenths of this mass of meat are sold? Just 2 roods 45\r\nperches, having one carriage entrance, which varies from 14 to 18 feet in\r\nwidth, and four foot entrances, the widest of which is only 16 feet 6\r\ninches, and the narrowest 5 feet 8 inches. No wonder that, as we are\r\ninformed by more than one of the witnesses before the Smithfield Inquiry\r\nCommission, there is often not sufficient space to expose the meat for\r\nsale, and it becomes putrid in consequence. Though we have acquired the\r\nfame of being a practical people, it must be confessed that we conduct\r\nmany of our every-day transactions in a blundering manner, when we cannot\r\nprovide commodious markets for perishable commodities, or even turn out an\r\nomnibus that can be mounted without an effort of agility and daring.\r\n\r\nMr. Giblett, the noted butcher, late of Bond Street, calculates that the\r\namount of meat brought by the railways into Newgate is three times that\r\nsupplied by the London carcase butchers, who annually send 52,000 oxen,\r\n156,000 sheep, 10,400 calves, and 10,400 pigs. Taking this estimate, and\r\napplying it also to the Leadenhall market, we shall have at\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                            |_Beasts._| _Sheep._|_Calves._| _Pigs._|\r\n  |----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\r\n  |Newgate, meat               | 156,000 |  468,000|  31,200 |  31,200|\r\n  |Leadenhall, ditto           |   5,200 |   41,600|   ..    |   ..   |\r\n  |                            |---------|---------|---------|--------|\r\n  |                            | 161,200 |  509,600|  31,200 |  31,200|\r\n  |Live stock brought to London| 322,188 |1,630,793| 101,776 | 127,852|\r\n  |                            |---------|---------|---------|--------|\r\n  |Total supply of live stock }|         |         |         |        |\r\n  |  and meat to London       }| 483,388 |2,140,393| 132,976 | 159,052|\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThis we are convinced is still below the truth, for we have not included\r\nthe country-killed meat sold at Farringdon and Whitechapel markets.[24]\r\nThe total value of this enormous supply of flesh cannot be much less than\r\nfourteen millions annually.\r\n\r\nThese figures demonstrate that the falling off of sheep sent to London is\r\nsolely because they now come to town in the form of mutton. It is sent to\r\na much greater extent than beef, in consequence of its arriving in finer\r\ncondition, being more easily carried, and better worth the cost of\r\nconveyance on account of the larger proportion of prime joints. Indeed,\r\nthe entire carcase of the oxen never comes, since the coarse\r\nboiling-pieces would have to pay the same carriage as the picked\r\n\"roastings.\" Newgate, be it remembered, is eminently a West End market,\r\nand fully two-thirds of its meat find its way to that quarter of the town.\r\nAccordingly, most of the beef \"pitched\" here consists of sirloins and\r\nribs; and, in addition to whole carcases of sheep, there are numerous\r\nseparate legs and saddles of mutton. This accounts for a fact that has\r\npuzzled many, namely, how London manages to get such myriads of chops. Go\r\ninto any part of the metropolis, and look into the windows of the thousand\r\neating-houses and coffee-shops in the great thoroughfares, and in every\r\none of them there is the invariable blue dish with half a dozen juicy,\r\nwell-trimmed chops, crowned with a sprig of parsley. To justify such a\r\nnumber, either fourfold the supply of sheep must come to London that we\r\nhave any account of, or in lieu of the ordinary number of vertebræ they\r\nmust possess as many as the great boa. When the prodigious store of\r\nsaddles which the country spares the town have once been seen the wonder\r\nceases. \"Sometimes I cut 100 saddles into mutton-chops to supply the\r\neating-houses,\" says Mr. Banister, of Threadneedle Street.\r\n\r\nThe weather preserves a most delicate balance between Newgate and\r\nSmithfield. Winter is the busy time at the former market, when meat can be\r\ncarried any distance without fear of taint. As soon as summer sets in,\r\nSmithfield takes its turn; for butchers then prefer to purchase live\r\nstock, in order that they may kill them the exact moment they are\r\nrequired. Sometimes as many as 1,200 beasts and from 12,000 to 15,000\r\nsheep are slaughtered in hot weather on a Friday night, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Smithfield, for Saturday's market. Every precaution is\r\ntaken on the railways to keep the meat sweet. The Eastern Counties Company\r\nprovide \"peds,\" or cloths cut to the shape of the carcase or joint, for\r\nthe use of their customers, and sometimes it is conveyed from the north in\r\nboxes. When, in spite of care, it turns out to be tainted, the salesman to\r\nwhom it is consigned calls the officer of the market, by whom it is\r\nforthwith sent to Cow Cross, and there burnt in the nacker's yard.\r\nAccording, however, to a competent witness--Mr. Harper--bad meat in any\r\nquantity can be disposed of in the metropolis to butchers living in low\r\nneighbourhoods, who impose it upon the poor at night. \"There is one shop,\r\nI believe,\" he says, \"doing 500_l._ per week in diseased meat. This firm\r\nhas a large foreign trade. The trade in diseased meat is very alarming,\r\nand anything in the shape of flesh can be sold at about 1_d._ per pound or\r\n8_d._ per stone.\"\r\n\r\nIf the reader is not already surfeited with the mountains of meat we have\r\npiled before his eyes, let us beg his attention for a few minutes to game\r\nand poultry, which we bring on in their proper course. Leadenhall and\r\nNewgate, as all the world knows, are the great metropolitan depôts for\r\nthis class of food, especially the former, which receives perhaps\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire supply. The quantities of game and wild birds\r\nconsigned to some of the large salesmen almost exceeds belief. After a few\r\nsuccessful battues in the Highlands, it is not at all unusual for one firm\r\nto receive 5,000 head of game, and as many as 20,000 to 30,000 larks are\r\noften sent up to market together. All other kinds of the feathered tribe\r\nwhich are reputed good for food are received in proportionate abundance.\r\nIf it were not for the great salesmen, many a merry dinner would be\r\nmarred, for the retail poulterers would be totally incapable of executing\r\nthe constant and sudden orders for the banquets which are always\r\nproceeding. The good people at the Crystal Palace have already learned to\r\nconsume, besides unnumbered other items, 600 chickens daily; and from this\r\nwe may guess how vast the wants of the entire metropolis. The sources from\r\nwhich game and poultry are derived are fewer than might be imagined. The\r\nHighlands and Yorkshire send up nearly all the grouse; and scores of\r\nnoblemen, members of Parliament, and other wealthy or enthusiastic\r\nsportsmen, who are at this present moment beating over the moors, and\r\nwalking for their pleasure twenty-five miles a day, assist to furnish this\r\ndelicacy to the London public at a moderate rate.\r\n\r\nPheasants and partridges mainly come from Norfolk and Suffolk; snipes from\r\nthe marshy lowlands of Holland, which also provides our entire supply of\r\nteal, widgeon, and other kinds of wild fowl, with the exception of those\r\ncaught in the \"decoys\" of Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire. From Ostend\r\nthere are annually transmitted to London 600,000 tame rabbits, which are\r\nreared for the purpose on the neighbouring sand dunes. We are indebted to\r\nIreland for flocks of plovers, and quails are brought from Egypt and the\r\nsouth of Europe. In most of our poulterers' windows may be seen the long\r\nwooden boxes, with a narrow slit, in which these latter birds are kept\r\nuntil required for the spit. Not long since upwards of 17,000 came to\r\nLondon _viâ_ Liverpool, whither they had been brought from the Campagna,\r\nnear Rome. Of the 2,000,000 of fowls that every year find a resting-place\r\n_vis-à-vis_ to boiled tongues on our London tables, by far the greatest\r\nquantity are drawn from the counties of Surrey and Sussex, where the\r\nDorking breed is in favour. Ireland also sends much poultry. No less than\r\n1,400 tons of chickens, geese, and ducks are brought to town annually by\r\nthe Great Western Railway, most of which are from the neighbourhood of\r\nCork and Waterford, whence they are shipped to Bristol. Londoners are\r\naccustomed to see shops of late years which profess to sell \"West of\r\nEngland produce,\" such as young pork, poultry, butter, and clouted cream.\r\nAll these delicacies are brought by the Great Western Railway, and are\r\nprincipally the contributions of Somersetshire and Devonshire. The bulk of\r\nthe geese, ducks, and turkeys, however, come from Norfolk, Cambridge,\r\nEssex, and Suffolk--four fat counties, which do much to supply the London\r\ncommissariat, the Eastern Counties Railway alone having brought thence\r\nlast year 22,462 tons of fish, flesh, fowl, and good red herrings.\r\n\r\nFor pigeons we are indebted to \"our fair enemy France,\" as Sir Philip\r\nSydney calls her, but now we trust our fast friend. They proceed\r\nprincipally from the interior, and are shipped for our market from\r\nBoulogne and Calais. How many eggs we get from across the Channel we\r\nscarcely like to say. Mr. M'Culloch considers that the capital receives\r\nfrom 70,000,000 to 75,000,000--a number which we think must be much below\r\nthe mark, seeing that the Brighton and South Coast line brings annually\r\n2,600 tons, the produce of Belgium and France. At Bastoign, in the latter\r\ncountry, there is a farm of 200 acres entirely devoted to the rearing of\r\npoultry and the production of eggs for the supply of London.\r\n\r\nNo perfectly accurate account can be given of the number per annum of\r\npoultry, game, and wild birds which enter Leadenhall and Newgate markets;\r\nbut the following estimate was handed to us by a dealer who turns over\r\n100,000_l._ a year in this trade. As the list takes no account of the\r\nquantity which goes direct to the retailer, nor of the thousands sent as\r\npresents, it must fall short of the actual consumption:--\r\n\r\n  Grouse                         100,000\r\n  Partridges                     125,000\r\n  Pheasants                       70,000\r\n  Snipes                          80,000\r\n  Wild Birds (mostly small)      150,000\r\n  Plovers                        150,000\r\n  Quails                          30,000\r\n  Larks                          400,000\r\n  Widgeon                         70,000\r\n  Teal                            30,000\r\n  Wild Ducks                     200,000\r\n  Pigeons                        400,000\r\n  Domestic Fowls               2,000,000\r\n  Geese                          100,000\r\n  Ducks                          350,000\r\n  Turkeys                        104,000\r\n  Hares                          100,000\r\n  Rabbits                      1,300,000\r\n                               ---------\r\n  Total                        5,759,000\r\n\r\nIn addition to its dead game and wild fowl, Leadenhall market is quite a\r\nNoah's ark of live animals. Geese, ducks, swans, pigeons, and cocks,\r\nbewilder you with their noise. Intermingled with these birds of a feather\r\nare hawks, ferrets, dogs and cats, moving about in their wicker cages, and\r\nalmost aggravated to madness by the proximity of their prey. The major\r\nportion of the live stock is designed either for sporting purposes or for\r\n\"petting\" and breeding, and do not belong to the commissariat department.\r\nOf the dead game and poultry, the seven railways bring to London about\r\n7,871 tons weight in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of the poultry-yard we are reminded of the dairy, and of\r\nthe large establishments required to fill the milk-jugs of London. There\r\nare at the present moment, as near as we can learn, 20,000 cows in the\r\nmetropolitan and suburban dairies, some of which number 500 cows apiece.\r\nEven these gigantic establishments have been occasionally exceeded, and\r\none individual, several years ago, possessed 1,500 milkers--a fact fatal\r\nto the popular superstition, that notwithstanding many attempts, no\r\ndairyman could ever muster more than 999. The terrible ravages of\r\npleuro-pneumonia, which many believe to be a contagious disease, have\r\ncured the passion for such extensive herds. The larger dairies of the\r\nmetropolis are on the whole admirably managed, and the cows luxuriate in\r\nairy outhouses, but the smaller owners are often confined for space, and\r\nthe animals are sometimes cooped in sheds, placed in tiers one above\r\nanother. The country dairymaid laughs at the ignorance which the Londoner\r\nbetrays of rural matters when on a visit to her master, but she would be\r\nperplexed in her turn if told that in the capital they fed the cows\r\nchiefly upon brewers' grains, and milked them on the _second story_? A\r\nfew years since Mr. Rugg appalled the town, which had forgotten Matthew\r\nBramble, Esq., and the \"New Bath Guide,\" by detailing a nauseous process\r\nwhich he affirmed was in use among cunning milkmen for the adulteration of\r\ntheir milk. There was, however, a great deal of exaggeration in the\r\naccount, and Dr. Hassell, whose analysis of various articles of food in\r\nthe _Lancet_ are widely known, states that the \"iron-tailed cow\" is the\r\nmain agent employed in the fraud, and that the only colouring matter he\r\nhas been enabled to discover is annatto. Nearly all the cream goes to the\r\nWest-End; and one dairyman living at Islington informed us that he made\r\n1,200_l._ a year by the trade he carried on in that single article with\r\nthe fashionable part of the town. It must be evident, upon the least\r\nconsideration, that the London and suburban dairies alone could not supply\r\nthe metropolis. If each of the 20,000 cows give on the average twelve\r\nquarts a day, the sum total would only be 240,000 quarts. If we suppose\r\nthis quantity to be increased by the exhaustless \"iron-tailed cow,\" of\r\nwhich Dr. Hassell speaks, to 300,000 quarts, the allowance to each\r\nindividual of the two millions and a quarter of population would be little\r\nmore than a quarter of a pint. This is clearly below the exigencies of the\r\ntea-table, the nursery, and the kitchen, and we do not think we shall make\r\nan overestimate if we assume that half as much again is daily consumed.\r\nHere again the railway, which in some cases brings milk from as far as\r\neighty miles, makes up the deficiency. The Eastern Counties line conveyed\r\nin 1853 to London, 3,174,179 quarts, the North-Western 144,000 quarts, the\r\nGreat Western 23,400 quarts, the Brighton and South Coast 100 tons, and\r\nthe Great Northern as much perhaps as the North-Western. The milk is\r\ncollected from the farmers by agents in the country, who sell it to the\r\nmilkmen, of whom there are 1,347, to distribute it over the town. In\r\ncourse of time it is possible that town dairies may entirely disappear.\r\nCowsheds, often narrow and low, in thickly-populated localities, cannot be\r\nas healthy for the animals as a purer atmosphere; and though experiment\r\nhas shown that they thrive admirably when stalled, the food they get in\r\nthese urban prisons can hardly be as wholesome as that provided by the\r\nverdant pastures of the farm. The milk which comes by railway has,\r\nhowever, this disadvantage, that it will not keep nearly so long as the\r\nindigenous produce of the metropolitan dairies. The different companies\r\nhave constructed waggons lightly hung on springs, but the churning effect\r\nof sudden joltings cannot be altogether got rid of.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetables and fruit that are brought into the various markets of\r\nthe capital, but especially to Covent Garden, a very large quantity is\r\ngrown in the immediate neighbourhood. From whatever quarter the railway\r\ntraveller approaches London, he perceives that the cultivation of the land\r\ngradually heightens, until he arrives at those suburban residences which\r\nform the advanced guards of the metropolis. The fields give place to\r\nhedgeless gardens, in which, to use a phrase of Washington Irving, \"the\r\nfurrows seem finished rather with the pencil than the plough.\" Acre after\r\nacre flashes with hand-glasses, streaks of verdure are ruled in close\r\nparallel lines across the soil with mathematical precision, interspersed\r\nhere and there with patches as sharp cut at the edges as though they were\r\npieces of green baize--these are the far-famed market-gardens. They are\r\nprincipally situated in the long level tracts of land that must once have\r\nbeen overflowed by the Thames--such as the flat alluvial soil known as the\r\nJerusalem Level, extending between London Bridge and Greenwich--and the\r\ngrounds about Fulham, Battersea, Chelsea, Putney, and Brentford. Mr.\r\nCuthill, who is perhaps the best authority on this subject, estimates that\r\nthere are 12,000 acres under cultivation for the supply of vegetables and\r\n5,000 for fruit-trees. This seems an insufficient area for the supply of\r\nso many mouths, but manure and active spade husbandry compensate for lack\r\nof space. By these agencies four and sometimes five crops are extracted\r\nfrom the land in the course of the year. The old-fashioned farmer,\r\naccustomed to the restrictions of old-fashioned leases, would stare at\r\nsuch a statement, and ask how long it would last. But his surprise would\r\nbe still greater at being told that after every clearance the ground is\r\ndeeply trenched, and its powers restored with a load of manure to every\r\nthirty square feet of ground. This is the secret of the splendid return,\r\nand it could be effected nowhere but in the neighbourhood of such cities\r\nas London, where the produce of the fertilizer is sufficiently great to\r\nkeep down its price. And here we have a striking example of town and\r\ncountry reciprocation. The same waggon that in the morning brings a load\r\nof cabbages, is seen returning a few hours later filled with dung. An\r\nexact balance as far as it goes is thus kept up, and the manure, instead\r\nof remaining to fester among human beings, is carted away to make\r\nvegetables. What a pity we cannot extend the system, and turn the whole\r\nsewerage by drain-pipes entirely into the rural districts, to feed the\r\nland, instead of allowing it, as we do, to run into the Thames and pollute\r\nthe water to be used in our dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe care and attention bestowed by the market-gardeners is incredible to\r\nthose who have not witnessed it; every inch of ground is taken advantage\r\nof--cultivation runs between the fruit-trees; storming-parties of cabbages\r\nand cauliflowers swarm up to the very trunks of apple-trees;\r\nraspberry-bushes are surrounded and cut off by young seedlings. If you see\r\nan acre of celery growing in ridges, be sure that, on a narrow inspection,\r\nyou will find long files of young peas picking their way along the\r\nfurrows. Everything flourishes here except weeds, and you may go over a\r\n150-acre piece of ground without discovering a single one. Quality, even\r\nmore than quantity, is attended to by the best growers; and they nurse\r\ntheir plants as they would children. The visitor will sometimes see \"the\r\nheads\" of an acre of cauliflowers one by one folded up in their own leaves\r\nas carefully as an anxious wife wraps up an asthmatic husband on a\r\nNovember night; and if rain should fall, attendants run to cover them up,\r\nas quickly as they cover up the zoological specimens at the Crystal Palace\r\nwhen the watering-pots are set to work.\r\n\r\nInsects and blight are also banished as strictly as from the court of\r\nOberon. To such a pitch is vigilance carried, that, according to a writer\r\nin _Household Words_, blight and fungi are searched after with a\r\nmicroscope, woodlice exterminated by bantems dressed in socks to prevent\r\ntoo much scratching, and other destructive insects despatched by the aid\r\nof batches of toads, purchased at the rate of six shillings a dozen!\r\n\r\nThe continual extension of London is, however, rapidly encroaching upon\r\nall the old market-gardens, and they are obliged to move farther a-field:\r\nthus high cultivation, like a green fairy-ring, is gradually widening and\r\nenlarging its circle round the metropolis. The coarser kinds of vegetables\r\nare but sparingly grown in these valuable grounds, but come up in large\r\nquantities from all parts of the country; and some of the choice kinds are\r\nnow reared far away in Devonshire and Cornwall, where they are favoured by\r\nthe climate. It would be interesting to get an authentic statement of the\r\nacreage dedicated to fruit and vegetables for the London market, but we\r\nfind the information unattainable. Mr. Cuthill calculates that there are\r\n200 acres employed around the metropolis in the growth of strawberries,\r\nand 5 acres planted as mushroom-beds. Cucumbers were once very largely\r\ncultivated. He has seen as many as 14 acres under hand-glasses in a single\r\ndomain, and has known 200,000 gherkins cut in a morning for the\r\npickle-merchants. Strangely enough, they have refused to grow well around\r\nLondon ever since the outbreak of the potato disease. The disastrous\r\nepidemic of 1849, we have little doubt, had much to do with the diminished\r\nsupply, for the cholera soon brought about the result desired by Mrs.\r\nGamp, \"when cowcumbers is three for twopence,\" prices quite explanatory of\r\nthe indisposition of the land to produce them. The very high state of\r\ncultivation in the metropolitan market-gardens necessitates the employment\r\nof a large amount of labour; and it is supposed that no less than 35,000\r\npersons are engaged in the service of filling the vegetable and\r\ndessert-dishes of the metropolis. This estimate leaves out those in the\r\nprovinces and on the Continent, which would, we doubt not, nearly double\r\nthe calculation, and show a troop of men and women as large as the entire\r\nBritish army. There are five marts in London devoted to the sale of\r\nfruit--Covent Garden, Spitalfields, the Borough, Farringdon, and\r\nPortman-markets,--besides a vast number of street offsets, such as\r\nClare-market, in which hawkers generally stand with their barrows. Covent\r\nGarden is not only their type, but it does nearly as much business as all\r\nof them put together, and for that reason we shall dwell upon it to the\r\nexclusion of the others.\r\n\r\nAt the first dawn of morning in the midst of squalid London, sweet country\r\nodours greet the early-riser, and cool orchards and green strawberry\r\nslopes seem ever present to the mind.\r\n\r\nIf those who seek pleasure in gaiety have never visited the market in its\r\nprime, let them journey thither some summer morning, and note how fresh\r\nwill seem the air, and how full of life the people, after the languid\r\nwaltz in Grosvenor Square. The central alley of the \"Garden,\" as it is\r\ncalled by the costermongers, is one of the prettiest lounges in town; and,\r\nwhether by chance or design, it exhibits, in its arrangement from east to\r\nwest, a complete march of the seasons. At the western entrance the visitor\r\nis greeted with the breath of flowers; and there they show in smiling\r\nbanks piled upon the stalls, or sorted with frilled edges into ladies'\r\nbouquets. As he proceeds, he comes upon the more delicate spring\r\nvegetables--pink shafts of the oriental-looking rhubarb, delicate cos\r\nlettuce, &c.; still further along the arcade, the plate-glass windows on\r\neither side display delicate fruits, done up in dainty boxes, and set off\r\nwith tinted paper shreds. Behind these windows also might be seen those\r\nrarities which it is the pride of London market-gardeners to provide, and\r\nin producing which they all struggle to steal the longest march upon\r\ntime--a sieve-full of early potatoes, each as small and costly as the egg\r\nof a Cochin-China fowl--a basin-full of peas, at a guinea a pint--a\r\ncucumber marked 5_s._, and strawberries 18_s._ the ounce.\r\n\r\nThe market-gardeners of Penzance are beginning to send up many of these\r\nearly vegetables, the mildness of the south-western extremity of Cornwall\r\ngiving them a wonderful advantage over every other part of the kingdom.\r\nGentlemen's gardeners also contribute somewhat, by sending to the salesmen\r\nsuch of the produce of their glazed houses as is not consumed in the\r\nfamily, and receive articles in return of which they happen to have an\r\ninsufficient quantity themselves. These forced vegetables give way, it is\r\ntrue, as the season advances; but when in, they are always most to be\r\nfound at that end of the walk nearest the rising sun. As the year\r\nproceeds, the lustier and more natural fruits are displayed--peaches that\r\nhave ripened with blushing cheek to the wind, gigantic strawberries,\r\nraspberries, nectarines, or blooming plums. Feathery pines add their\r\nmellow hue; and when these fail, the colour deepens into amber piles of\r\noranges, umber filberts, and the rich brown of Spanish chestnuts, the\r\nproduce of the waning year.\r\n\r\nTo leave, however, our fancied procession of the seasons, and to return to\r\nthe actual business of the market. As early as two o'clock in the morning,\r\na person looking down the dip of Piccadilly will perceive the first influx\r\nof the daily supply of vegetables and fruit to Covent Garden market:\r\nwaggons of cabbages, built up and regularly faced, with the art rather of\r\nthe mason than the market-gardener; light spring-vans fragrant with\r\nstrawberries; and milk-white loads of turnips which slowly roll along the\r\ngreat-western road, and bring the produce of the fertile alluvial shores\r\nof the Thames to the great west-end mart. The pedestrian proceeding along\r\nthe southern and eastern roads sees the like stream of vegetable food\r\nquietly converging to the same spot. From this hour, especially upon a\r\nSaturday morning, until nine o'clock, the scene at the market itself is of\r\nthe most exciting description.\r\n\r\nWithout some organization it would be impossible to receive and display to\r\nthe advantage of the buyer and seller the varied products that in the grey\r\nof the morning pours into so limited a space. Accordingly, different\r\nportions of it are dedicated to distinct classes of vegetables and fruits.\r\nThe finest of the delicate soft fruit, such as strawberries, peaches, &c.,\r\nare lodged, as we have mentioned, in the central alley of the market--the\r\ninmost leaf of the rose. On the large covered space to the north of this\r\ncentral alley is the wholesale fruit-station, fragrant with apples, pears,\r\ngreengages, or whatever is in season. The southern open space is\r\ndedicated to cabbages and other vegetables; and the extreme south front is\r\nwholly occupied by potato-salesmen. Around the whole quadrangle, during a\r\nbusy morning, there is a party-coloured fringe of waggons backed in\r\ntowards the central space, in which the light green of cabbages forms the\r\nprevailing colour, interrupted here and there with the white of turnips,\r\nor the deep orange of digit-like carrots; and as the spectator watches,\r\nthe whole mass is gradually absorbed into the centre of the market.\r\nMeanwhile the space dedicated to wholesale fruit sales is all alive.\r\nColumns of empty baskets twelve feet high seem progressing through the\r\ncrowd \"of their own motion.\" The vans have arrived from the railways, and\r\nrural England, side by side with the Continent, pours in its supplies from\r\nmany a sheltered mossy nook. It is very easy to discover by a glance which\r\nare the home-grown, which the foreign contributions. There stand the\r\nEnglish baskets and sieves, solid and stout as Harry the Eighth, amidst\r\nlittle hampers, as delicate as French ladies, and seemingly as incapable\r\nof withstanding hard usage. Yet some of these have come from Algiers,\r\nothers from the south of France with greengages, and the majority from\r\nNormandy. France is beginning to send large quantities of peaches and\r\nnectarines, carefully packed with paper-shavings in small boxes; and even\r\nstrawberries this summer have found their way here from the same quarter.\r\nThe frosts which sometimes occur in the early part of the year, destroy\r\nnearly all the fruit-crops in the neighbourhood of London; and were it not\r\nfor the bountiful stores which are brought from abroad, Covent Garden\r\nwould be little better than a desert.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the high duty upon foreign fruit has so far widened the\r\nfield of supply that it can no longer be destroyed by an unusual fall of\r\nthe mercury. By means of the telegraph, the steamboat, and the railroad,\r\nwe annul the effects of frost, obliterate the sea, and command, at a few\r\nhours' notice, the produce of the Continent. When there is a dearth in\r\nthis country the fact is immediately noticed by the great fruit-dealers in\r\nthe City: the telegraph forthwith conveys the information to Holland,\r\nFrance, and Belgium; and within forty hours steamers from one or other of\r\nthese countries will be seen making towards the Downs and adjoining\r\ncoasts, and in another six their cargoes, fresh plucked from the\r\nneighbourhoods of old Norman abbeys and quaint Flemish stadthouses, are\r\nblooming in Covent Garden. Fruit that will bear delay comes up the Thames\r\nby boat, and is discharged at the wharfs near London Bridge, but the major\r\npart eventually finds its way to the \"Garden.\" The South-Western and\r\nSouth-Eastern are the two principal lines for foreign fruit: the former\r\nbrings large quantities of Spanish and Portuguese produce--such as\r\noranges, grapes, melons, nuts, &c.; the latter conveys apples, pears,\r\nstrawberries, peaches, nectarines, &c., from Dover, to which place they\r\nare brought by steamers. To show how enormous is the supply from abroad,\r\nwe give, on the authority of the goods-manager of the South-Eastern line,\r\nthe amount brought by them in one night:--\r\n\r\n  100 tons of green peas from France.\r\n   50  \"   of fruit from Kent.\r\n   10  \"   of filberts from Kent.\r\n   25  \"   of plums from France.\r\n   10  \"   of black currants from France.\r\n\r\nIn all 195 tons; out of which 135 were from across the water. The Brighton\r\nand South Coast transmit the produce of Jersey and Dieppe--apples, pears,\r\nand plums--to the extent last year of about 300 tons. Of vegetables the\r\nGreat Northern is the principal carrier; last year they brought to town\r\nthe enormous quantity of 45,819 tons of potatoes, besides 1,940 tons of\r\nother vegetables. The potatoes mainly proceed from the fen country.\r\nWalnuts generally come by the Antwerp boats, which sometimes carry cargoes\r\nof between 400 and 500 tons. Everybody who has travelled in the Low\r\nCountries remembers the magnificent walnut-trees which grow along the\r\nsides of the canals as commonly as elms in our own country. These eke out\r\nour scantier native stores, and help to make cosier the after-dinner chat\r\nover the glass of port. During two mornings that we visited Covent Garden\r\nwe saw 613 bushel-baskets of strawberries that had just come from\r\nHonfleur, and upwards of 1,000 baskets of greengages arrived from the same\r\nneighbourhood during the week. As we gazed, on one of these occasions upon\r\nthe solid walls of baskets extending down the market, crowned with\r\nparapets of peach and nectarine boxes, we wondered in our own minds\r\nwhether it would ever be all sold, and the wonder increased as waggon\r\nafter waggon arrived, piled up as high as the second-floor windows of the\r\npiazza. Venturing to express this doubt to a lazy-looking man who was\r\nplaiting the strands of a whip, \"Blessee, sir,\" he replied without looking\r\nup from his work, \"the main part on 'em will be at Brummagem by\r\ndinner-time.\" True enough, while we had been guessing and wondering, a\r\nnimble fellow had run to the telegraph and inquired of Birmingham and a\r\nfew distant towns whether they were in want of certain fruits that\r\nmorning. The answer being in the affirmative, the vans turned round,\r\nrattled off to the North-Western station, and in another hour the\r\nsuperfluity of Covent Garden was rushing on its way to fill up the\r\ndeficiency of the midland counties. Thus the wire and steam, both at home\r\nand abroad, cause the supply to respond instantly to the demand, however\r\nwide apart the two principles may be working.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry trade of Covent Garden is not likely, however, at present\r\nto fall into the hands of foreigners. The London market-gardeners have\r\nlong looked with justice upon this fruit as particularly their own. By the\r\nskill they have bestowed upon its culture it has advanced enormously, both\r\nin flavour and size, from the old standard \"hautboy\" of our fathers, and\r\nwhich foreigners mainly cultivate to the present day. Mr. Miatt, of\r\nDeptford, is the great grower; by judicious grafting he has produced from\r\nthe old stock half-a-dozen different kinds, the most celebrated being the\r\n\"British Queen,\" which attains a prodigious size. Large quantities of\r\nstrawberries are sent to the market in light spring-vans. They are placed\r\nin 1 lb. punnets or round willow baskets, or they are carefully piled in\r\npottles, and the process of \"topping-up,\" as it is called, is considered\r\nquite an art in the trade. The rarest and ripest fruit, which goes direct\r\nto the pastrycooks, is still more deftly treated. Lest it should be\r\ninjured by jolting, horse is exchanged for human carriage. A procession of\r\neight or ten stout women, carrying baskets full of strawberry-pottles upon\r\ntheir heads, may often be seen streaming in hot haste up Piccadilly,\r\npreceded by a man, like so many sheep by a bell-wether. It is probable\r\nthat they have trudged all the way from Isleworth with the fruit, and, as\r\nthey frequently make two journeys in the day, the distance traversed is\r\nnot less than twenty-six miles.\r\n\r\nAfter strawberries, perhaps peas are the most important article produced\r\nby the market-gardeners. Dealers, in order to consult the convenience of\r\nhotel-keepers and such as require suddenly a large supply for the table,\r\nkeep them ready for the saucepan; and not the least curious feature of\r\nCovent Garden, about midday, is to see a dense mass of women--generally\r\nold--seated in rows at the corner of the market, engaged in shelling them.\r\nOne salesman often employs as many as 400 persons in this occupation. The\r\nmajor part of these auxiliaries belong to the poor-houses around; they\r\nobtain permission to go out for this purpose, and the shilling or eighteen\r\npence a-day earned by some of the more expert is gladly exchanged for the\r\nmonotonous rations of the parish. In the autumn, again, there will be a\r\nrow of poor creatures, extending along the whole north side of the square,\r\nshelling walnuts, each person having two baskets, one for the nuts,\r\nanother for the shells, which are bought by the catsup-makers. The poor\r\nflock from all parts of the town directly a job of the kind is to be had.\r\nIf a fog happens in November, thousands of link-boys and men spring up\r\nwith ready-made torches; if a frost occurs, hundreds of men are to be\r\nfound on the Serpentine and other park waters, to sweep the ice or to put\r\non your skates: there are, in the busy part of the town half-a-dozen\r\nfellows ready of a wet day to rush simultaneously to call a cab \"for your\r\nhonour;\" and every crossing when it grows muddy almost instantly has its\r\nman and broom. A sad comment this upon the large floating population of\r\nstarving labour always to be found in the streets of London.\r\n\r\nThe busiest time at the market is about six o'clock, when the\r\ncostermongers surround Covent Garden with their barrows, and hundreds of\r\nstreet hawkers, with their hand-baskets and trays, come for their day's\r\nsupply. The same system of purchase is pursued here as at\r\nBillingsgate--the rich dealers buy largely and sell again, and the poorer\r\nclub their means and divide the produce. The regular street vender who\r\nkeeps his barrow, drawn by a donkey or a pony, looks down with a certain\r\ncontempt upon the inferior hawkers, principally Irish. They only deal in a\r\ncertain class of vegetables, such as peas, young potatoes, broccoli, or\r\ncauliflowers, and have nothing to do with _mere greens_. Another class of\r\npurchasers are the little girls who vend watercresses. Such is the demand\r\nfor cresses, that they are now largely cultivated for the market, the\r\nspontaneous growth proving quite inadequate to the demand. They are\r\nproduced principally at \"Spring Head,\" at Walthamstow, in Essex, and at\r\nCookham, Shrivenham, and Faringdon, on the line of the Great Western,\r\nwhich brings to town no less than a ton a week of this wholesome breakfast\r\nsalad. The best, however, come from Camden Town. Most people fancy that\r\nclear purling streams are necessary for their production; but the Camden\r\nTown beds are planted in an old brick-field, watered by the Fleet Ditch;\r\nand though the stream at this point is comparatively pure, they owe their\r\nunusually luxuriant appearance to a certain admixture of the sewerage. A\r\ngreat many hundreds of bunches are sold every morning in Covent Garden;\r\nbut the largest share goes to Farringdon Market. The entire supply to the\r\nvarious metropolitan markets cannot be less than three tons weekly.\r\nRhubarb is almost wholly furnished by the London market-gardeners. It was\r\nfirst introduced by Mr. Miatt forty years ago, who sent his two sons to\r\nthe Borough Market with five bunches, of which they only sold three. From\r\nthis time he continued its cultivation, notwithstanding the sneers at what\r\nwere called his \"physic pies.\" As he predicted, it soon became a\r\nfavourite, and now hundreds of tons weight are sold in Covent Garden in\r\nthe course of the year. It would be impossible to give any precise account\r\nof the fruit and vegetable produce that is poured day by day into London;\r\nfor the authorities themselves only know how many baskets arrive, not how\r\nmuch they contain. The railway returns give us the quantity brought from a\r\ndistance, and we find that the seven lines transmit annually somewhere\r\nabout 70,000 tons of vegetables and soft green fruit. This is irrespective\r\nof dried fruit, oranges, &c.--a business of itself, involving great\r\ninterests, and employing an immense capital, and of which we will say a\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\nThe foreign-fruit trade has its head-quarters in the city. The pedestrian\r\nwho walks down Fish Street Hill would assuredly never surmise that at\r\ncertain seasons a regular fruit exhibition is kept up within those dull\r\nbrick houses, before which the tall column lifts its head. All the world\r\nknows the Messrs. Keeling and Hunt, whose effigies seem to stand, in the\r\npublic eye, upon a vast pyramid of pine-apples. This firm hold sales of\r\nvarious kinds of fruit in their auction-rooms in Monument Yard. On these\r\noccasions the long apartments make a show, before which, for quantity at\r\nleast, that of Chiswick pales. Pine-apples by thousands, melons, forbidden\r\nfruit, and mangoes, fill the room from end to end; so famous indeed is the\r\ndisplay, that there are lithographic engravings of it, in which the\r\nsalesmen are seen walking about as perplexed, apparently by the luscious\r\nluxuriance around them, as Adam might have been in his own happy garden.\r\nThe pine-apple market is of modern date. The first cargo was brought over\r\nabout twenty years ago, and since that time the traffic has rapidly\r\nincreased, and at the present moment 300,000 pines come yearly into the\r\nport of London, of which nine-tenths are consigned to Messrs. Keeling and\r\nHunt, the original importers. They are principally from the Bahamas, in\r\nthe West Indies, where they grow almost spontaneously; but of late years\r\nthey have been more carefully cultivated, and grafts of our best hothouse\r\npines have been taken out to improve their quality. There is a fleet of\r\nclippers appropriated to the carriage across the sea of this single fruit.\r\nThe melons come from Spain, Portugal, and Holland. Spain is known to\r\nabound in melons, for Murillo's beggar-boys are perpetually eating them;\r\nbut we believe it will be news to most Englishmen that the land of dykes\r\nsupplies London with fragrant cargoes of an almost tropical fruit. The\r\nlargest foreign-fruit trade, however, by far, is that in oranges. We\r\nshall perhaps astonish our readers when we tell them that upwards of\r\n60,000,000 are imported for the use of London alone, accompanied by not\r\nless than 15,000,000 lemons. Any time between December and May the orange\r\nclippers from the Azores and Lisbon may be seen unloading their cargoes in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the great stores in Pudding and Botolph Lanes. There\r\nare 240 of these fast-sailing vessels engaged in the entire trade, and of\r\nthis fleet seventy at least are employed in supplying the windows of the\r\nfruiterers and the apple-stalls of London. All these fruits, together with\r\nnuts and walnuts, apples, plums, pears, and some peaches, &c., are\r\ndisposed of weekly at the auction sales in Monument Yard to the general\r\ndealers, the majority of whom are located in Duke's Place, close at hand,\r\nand are mostly Jews. Indeed we are informed that many of them are the\r\nidentical boys grown up to manhood that used some twenty-five years ago to\r\nsell oranges about the streets, and whose old place has gradually been\r\ntaken by the Irish. They act as middlemen between the importers and the\r\ntribe of peripatetics who, at certain times of the day, resort hither to\r\nfill their baskets and barrows. Covent Garden also supplies retailers with\r\noranges and nuts, especially on Sunday mornings, when the place is\r\nsometimes crowded like a fair. The following bill of quantities, drawn up\r\nby Mr. Keeling, is derived, we believe, from the Custom House returns:--\r\n\r\n  _Fruit._\r\n\r\n  Apples            39,561 bushels.\r\n  Pears             19,742    \"\r\n  Cherries         264,240 lbs.\r\n  Grapes         1,328,190\r\n  Pine-apples      200,000\r\n  Oranges       61,635,146\r\n  Lemons        15,408,789\r\n\r\n  _Nuts._\r\n\r\n  Spanish nuts}     72,509 bushels\r\n  Barcolena   }\r\n  Brazil            11,700   \"\r\n  Chestnuts         26,250   \"\r\n  Walnuts           36,088   \"\r\n  Cocoa-nuts     1,255,009   \"\r\n\r\nOf the amount of bread consumed in London we have no specific information,\r\nbut there are data which enable us to approximate to the truth. Porter, in\r\nhis \"Progress of the Nation,\" gives us the returns of eight schools,\r\nfamilies, and institutions, containing 1,902 men, women, and children,\r\neach of whom ate on the average 331-1/16 lbs. of bread per annum. Now if\r\nwe multiply this quantity by the number of the inhabitants of the\r\nmetropolis--2,500,000, or thereabouts--we have a total of 413,700,000\r\nhalf-quartern loaves of 2 lbs. weight each. The flour used in puddings,\r\npies, &c., we throw in as a kind of offset against the London babies under\r\none year old. Some of this bread is a contribution from the country, and\r\none Railway--the Eastern Counties--brought last year 237 tons 12 cwts. to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how much sack goes to all this quantity of bread--with what\r\nrivers of stout, &c., we wash down such mountains of flesh. According to\r\nthe excise returns, there were 747,050 quarters of malt consumed in London\r\nin the year 1853 by the seventeen great brewers. As each quarter of malt,\r\nwith its proportionate allowance of hops, produces three and a half\r\nbarrels of beer, we get at the total brew of last year 1,614,675, or\r\npretty nearly a thousand million tumblers of ale and porter. On countless\r\nsign-boards of the metropolis this last is advertised by the title of\r\n\"entire,\" and it is thus that the liquid and its name arose. Prior to the\r\nyear 1730, publicans were in the habit of selling ale, beer, and twopenny,\r\nand the \"thirsty souls\" of that day were accustomed to combine either of\r\nthese in a drink called half-and-half. From this they proceeded to spin\r\n\"three threads,\" as they called it, or to have their glass filled from\r\neach of the three taps. In the year 1730, however, a certain publican,\r\nnamed Horwood, to save himself the trouble of making the triune mixture,\r\nbrewed a liquor intended to imitate the taste of the \"three threads,\" and\r\nto this he applied the term \"entire.\" His concoction was approved, and,\r\nbeing puffed as good porters' drink, it speedily came to be called porter\r\nitself. Of the seventeen great London breweries, the house of Truman,\r\nHanbury, Buxton, and Co. stood in 1853 at the top of the list, having\r\nconsumed 140,000 quarters of malt, and paid to the excise 180,000_l._, or\r\nenough to build two ninety-gun ships, at the usual cost of a thousand\r\npounds per gun. The visitor in proceeding through this establishment\r\nrealizes, perhaps better than in any other place, the enormous scale on\r\nwhich certain creature-comforts for the use of the town are produced. As\r\nhe walks between the huge boilers in which 1,600 barrels are brewed nearly\r\nevery day, or makes the circuit of the four great vats, each containing\r\n80,000 gallons of liquor, or loses himself amid the labyrinth of 135\r\nenormous reservoirs, which altogether hold 3,500,000 gallons--he begins to\r\nfancy himself an inhabitant of Lilliput, who has gone astray in a\r\nBrobdignagian cellar. There is a popular notion that the far-famed London\r\nstout owes its flavour to the Thames water: this, however, is a \"vulgar\r\nerror.\" Not even the Messrs. Barclay, who are upon the stream, draw any of\r\ntheir supply from that source, but it is got entirely from wells, and\r\nthose sunk so deep, that they and the Messrs. Calvert, whose brewery is\r\nhalf a mile distant upon the opposite side of the river, find they are\r\nrivals for the same spring. When one brewery pumps, it drains the wells of\r\nthe other, and the firms are obliged to obtain their water on alternate\r\ndays. Whether it is owing to the increase of the great breweries and of\r\nother manufactories, which alone consume millions of barrels of water\r\nyearly, we know not, but it is an ascertained fact, that the depth of\r\nwater in the London wells has for the last twenty-five years been\r\ndiminishing at the rate of a foot a year. \"It is comforting to reflect,\"\r\nsaid one of the great brewers, \"that the reason simply is, because the\r\nwater which used to be buried underground is now brought up to fill the\r\nbodies, wash the faces, and turn the wheels of two millions and a half of\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nIf the underground stock of water is shrinking, it has increased vastly on\r\nthe surface. The seven companies which supply the metropolis bring in\r\nbetween them 44,000,000 gallons daily--a quantity which, large as it is,\r\ncould be delivered in twenty-four hours by a brook nine feet wide and\r\nthree feet deep, running at the rate of three feet per second, or a\r\nlittle more than two miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe inability of figures to convey an adequate impression to the mind of\r\nthe series of units of which the sums are composed renders it impossible\r\nto give more than a faint idea of the enormous supplies of food required\r\nto victual the capital for a single year. But the conception may be\r\nsomewhat assisted by varying the process. Country papers now and then\r\nastonish their readers by calculations to show how many times the steel\r\npens manufactured in England would form a necklace round their own little\r\ntown, or how many thousand miles the matches of their local factory would\r\nextend if laid in a straight line from the centre of their market-place.\r\nLet us try our hand on the same sort of picture, and endeavour to fill the\r\neye with a prospect that would satisfy the appetite of the far-famed\r\nDragon of Wantley himself.\r\n\r\nIf we fix upon Hyde Park as our exhibition-ground, and pile together all\r\nthe barrels of beer consumed in London, they would form a thousand columns\r\nnot far short of a mile in perpendicular height.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine ourselves on the top of this tower, and we shall have a\r\nlook-out worthy of the feast we are about to summon to our feet. Herefrom\r\nwe might discover the Great Northern road stretching far away into the\r\nlength and breadth of the land. Lo! as we look, a mighty herd of oxen,\r\nwith loud bellowing, are beheld approaching from the north. For miles and\r\nmiles the mass of horns is conspicuous winding along the road, ten\r\nabreast, and even thus the last animal of the herd would be 72 miles away,\r\nand the drover goading his shrinking flank considerably beyond\r\nPeterborough. On the other side of the park, as the clouds of dust clear\r\naway, we see the great Western road, as far as the eye can reach, thronged\r\nwith a bleating mass of wool, and the shepherd at the end of the flock\r\n(ten abreast) and the dog that is worrying the last sheep are just leaving\r\nthe environs of Bristol, 121 miles from our beer-built pillar. Along\r\nPiccadily, Regent-street, the Strand, Fleet-street, Cheapside, and the\r\neastward Mile-end road line, for 7-1/2 miles, street and causeway are\r\nthronged with calves, still ten abreast; and in the great parallel\r\nthoroughfares of Bayswater-road, Oxford-street, and Holborn, we see\r\nnothing for nine long miles but a slowly-pacing, deeply-grunting herd of\r\nswine. As we watch this moving mass approaching from all points of the\r\nhorizon, the air suddenly becomes dark--a black pall seems drawn over the\r\nsky--it is the great flock of birds--game, poultry, and wild-fowl, that,\r\nlike Mrs. Bond's ducks, are come up to be killed: as they fly wing to wing\r\nand tail to beak they form a square whose superficies is not much less\r\nthan the whole enclosed portion of St. James's Park, or 51 acres. No\r\nsooner does this huge flight clear away than we behold the park at our\r\nfeet inundated with hares and rabbits.\r\n\r\nFeeding 2,000 abreast, they extend from the marble arch to the round pond\r\nin Kensington Gardens--at least a mile. Let us now pile up all the\r\nhalf-quartern loaves consumed in the metropolis in the year, and we shall\r\nfind they form a pyramid which measures 200 square feet at its base, and\r\nextends into the air a height of 1,293 feet, or nearly three times that of\r\nSt. Paul's. Turning now towards the sound of rushing waters, we find that\r\nthe seven companies are filling the mains for the day. If they were\r\nallowed to flow into the area of the adjacent St. James's Park, they would\r\nin the course of the 24 hours flood its entire space with a depth of 30\r\ninches of water, and the whole annual supply would be quite sufficient to\r\nsubmerge the city (one mile square) ninety feet. Of the fish we confess we\r\nare able to say nothing: when numbers mount to billions, the calculations\r\nbecome too trying to our patience. We have little doubt, however, that\r\nthey would be quite sufficient to make the Serpentine one solid mass. Of\r\nham and bacon again, preserved meats, and all the countless comestibles we\r\nhave taken no account, and in truth they are little more to the great mass\r\nthan the ducks and geese were to Sancho Panza's celebrated mess--\"the\r\nskimmings of the pot.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is a slight sketch of the great London larder. It may be\r\nimagined that many of these stores come to the metropolis only as to a\r\ncentre for redistribution, and are again scattered over the length and\r\nbreadth of the land. This, however, is not the case. The only line that\r\ntakes food in any quantities out of London is the North-Western. This\r\nrailway speeds into the midland counties, but especially to Birmingham,\r\n350 tons of fish consigned to the country dealers, and to the nobility and\r\ngentry. As we have before seen, van-loads of fruit are often despatched in\r\nthe same direction. The South-Eastern conveys large quantities of grain\r\ndown the line, and the London and Brighton and South Coast takes annually\r\nto Brighton twenty-six tons of meat and 1,100 cattle; and here all the\r\nfood carried _out_ of London in bulk ends. A constant dribble of edibles,\r\nit is true, is continually escaping by the passenger trains, of which the\r\nrailways take no notice in their goods-department traffic; but it must be\r\nremembered that a much larger quantity is perpetually flowing unheeded\r\ninto the London commissariat through the same channels. Of the stout and\r\nporter brewed in the metropolis by the great houses, again, one-seventh\r\nperhaps finds its way abroad--a drop in comparison to that which must be\r\ncontributed by the 2,482 smaller brewers of the town, and the great\r\ncontingent supplied by Guinness, Allsopp, and other pale-ale brewers. This\r\nsimple statement will suffice to make it evident that in the foregoing\r\npicture we have given anything but \"heaped measure.\"\r\n\r\nThe railways having poured this enormous amount of food into the\r\nmetropolis, as the main arteries feed the human body, it is distributed by\r\nthe various dealers into every quarter of the town, first into the\r\nwholesale markets, or great centres, then into the sub-centres, or retail\r\ntradesmen's shops, and lastly into the moving centres, or barrows of the\r\nhawkers, by which means nourishment is poured into every corner of the\r\ntown, and the community at large is supplied as effectually as are the\r\ncountless tissues of the human body by the infinitely divided network of\r\ncapillary vessels. According to the census of 1851, these\r\nfood-distributors are classified in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  _Males._\r\n\r\n  Grocers                                            6,475\r\n  Cowkeepers and milksellers                         3,372\r\n  Cheesemongers                                      2,156\r\n  Butchers                                           7,428\r\n  Poulterers                                           551\r\n  Fishmongers                                        2,238\r\n  Other dealers in animal food                       1,376\r\n  Greengrocers                                       3,325\r\n  Bakers                                             9,841\r\n  Confectioners                                      1,806\r\n  Other dealers in vegetable food                    1,303\r\n  Brewers                                            2,499\r\n  Licensed victuallers and beer-shop-keepers, &c.    6,843\r\n  Wine and spirit merchants                          1,915\r\n  Other dealers in drinks                            3,805\r\n  Saltmakers                                            37\r\n  Water-providers                                      428\r\n  Innkeepers                                           433\r\n                                                    ------\r\n                                                    56,601\r\n\r\n  _Females._\r\n\r\n  Grocers                                              676\r\n  Innkeepers                                            93\r\n  Innkeepers' wives                                    217\r\n  Cowkeepers                                         1,158\r\n  Butchers                                             205\r\n  Butchers' wives                                    3,086\r\n  Fishmongers                                          151\r\n  Others dealing in animal food                        283\r\n  Greengrocers                                         941\r\n  Bakers                                               480\r\n  Confectioners                                        542\r\n  Other dealers in vegetable food                      939\r\n  Licensed victuallers and beer-shop-keepers           970\r\n  Wives of ditto                                     4,440\r\n  Wine and spirit merchants                             15\r\n  Other dealers in drinks                              457\r\n                                                    ------\r\n                                                    14,653\r\n\r\nIf to this total of 71,254 we add the wandering tribe of costermongers,\r\nhawkers, and stall-keepers, estimated at 30,000 persons, we shall have an\r\narmy exceeding 100,000 persons; and, as indirectly there must be quadruple\r\nthis number of persons employed, the merest pauper among the population\r\nhas hundreds of invisible hands held out to provide him with the\r\nnecessaries and comforts of life. The smooth working of this great\r\ndistributive machine is due to the principle of competition--that spring\r\nwhich so nicely adjusts all the varying conditions of life, and which, in\r\nserving itself, does the best possible service to the community at large,\r\nand accomplishes more than the cleverest system of centralization which\r\nany individual mind could devise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOLWICH ARSENAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1716 the brass guns which Marlborough had taken from the\r\nFrench were being recast in the royal gun foundry in Moorfields, when a\r\nyoung Swiss named Andrew Schalch, who was accidentally present, remarking\r\nthe dampness of the moulds and foreseeing the inevitable result, warned\r\nColonel Armstrong the then Surveyor-General, against being too close a\r\nspectator of the operation. As Schalch foretold, an explosion took place,\r\nand many workmen were killed. \"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good,\"\r\nsays the old proverb, and the bursting of the gun was the making of the\r\nyoung foreigner's fortune; for in a few days an advertisement appeared in\r\none of the public papers requesting him to call upon Colonel Andrews, \"as\r\nthe interview may be for his advantage.\" Andrew Schalch attended\r\naccordingly, and was at once intrusted with the duty of seeking out a\r\nbetter locality for the casting of the royal ordnance. He selected a\r\nrabbit-warren at Woolwich, as the best site within twelve miles of the\r\nmetropolis, for the threefold reason that it was dry, near to the river,\r\nand in the immediate neighbourhood of loam for the moulds. Strangely\r\nenough, it has since been proved that the great nation of antiquity with\r\nwhom the British possess so many qualities in common, had been here\r\nbefore. The Romans, whose second station on the Watling Street out of\r\nLondon is supposed to have been at Hanging Wood, close at hand, seem to\r\nhave appropriated the sloping ground on which the original gun factory\r\nstands for the purposes of a cemetery, for on digging the foundations of\r\nsome new buildings urns of their manufacture were discovered in large\r\nquantities, and a very beautiful sepulchral vase, which is now in the\r\nmuseum of the Royal Artillery Institution. Thus, where the conquerors of\r\nthe old world lay down to their last rest, we, the Romans of the present\r\nage, forge the arms which make us masters of an empire beyond the dreams\r\nof the imperial Cæsars.\r\n\r\nAs the visitor enters the great gate of the Arsenal he finds no difficulty\r\nin tracing the whereabouts of the labours of Andrew, for straight before\r\nhim, with a stately solemnity which marked the conceptions of its builder,\r\nVanbrugh, stands the picturesque gun factory, with its high-pitched roof,\r\nred brickwork, and carved porch, looking like a fine old gentleman amid\r\nthe factory ranges which within these few years have sprung up around. It\r\nis impossible to contemplate this building without respect, for forth from\r\nits portals have issued that victorious ordnance which since the days of\r\nGeorge II. has swept the battle grounds of the old and the new world. Up\r\nto as late a date as the year 1842 the machinery within these stately old\r\nedifices was almost as antiquated in character as themselves. The three\r\ngreat boring-mills, moved by horses, which had been imported in 1780 as\r\nastonishing wonders from the Hague, were the only engines used in England\r\nin making her Majesty's ordnance till eighteen years ago. Such was the\r\nstate of efficiency of the oldest of the three great manufacturing\r\ndepartments of the Arsenal! The more modern departments, known as the\r\nRoyal Carriage Factory and the Laboratory, have flourished during the\r\npresent century in an unequal degree. For fifty years the former of these\r\nbranches of the Arsenal has been more or less in a high state of\r\nefficiency, through the introduction of machinery from the workshops of\r\nMessrs. Bramah and Maudslay, and of the contrivances of Bentham and Sir I.\r\nBrunei. The improvements which were due to their inventive genius rendered\r\nthis department highly efficient during the French war, on the conclusion\r\nof which a long period of inactivity followed; and it was not until 1847\r\nthat symptoms were manifested of renewed life under the able\r\nsuperintendence of General Gordon, and still later of Colonel Colquhoun.\r\nThe Laboratory during the same period appears to have remained entirely\r\nstationary, and up to the year 1853 was far inferior to that of any\r\nthird-rate power. The backward condition of the sole arsenal of England\r\nduring the long interval of peace seems at first sight remarkable, when we\r\nconsider the amount of mechanical ingenuity which had penetrated into\r\nevery factory in the kingdom; but when we remember that the instruments\r\nand munitions of war are special articles, wanted only for special\r\nperiods, occurring at uncertain intervals of time, the wonder ceases.\r\nPrivate manufacturers had no interest in forging instruments of\r\ndestruction, and the State having conquered \"a lasting peace,\" Vulcan was\r\nallowed to fall into a profound sleep--a sleep so unbroken, that the\r\nnation listened for a moment to the voice of those Manchester charmers who\r\nwould fain have persuaded us the time was come when our swords could with\r\nsafety be turned into pruning-hooks. In the midst of this amiable delusion\r\nthe Northern Eagle attempted to seize upon the sick man, and Britain\r\ninstinctively flew to arms. This sudden spasm of war following upon a\r\nforty years' peace at once disclosed the fact that we were totally\r\nunprepared to wage it. There were not shells enough in the Arsenal to\r\nfurnish forth the first battering-train that went to the East, and the\r\nfuses in store were of the date of Waterloo. A fourth part of the money\r\nwhich we joyfully expended when the wolf was at the door would have been\r\nthought the demand of a madman, when Europe was supposed to be one big\r\nsheepfold. Economy prevented efficient progress; and though the\r\nauthorities had latterly originated reforms, their exertions were limited\r\nby their scanty resources. As the war proceeded, the Ordnance were at\r\ntheir wits' end for coarse-grained gunpowder, which, as it was not an\r\narticle of commerce, had to be specially made for them. Small arms were\r\nwanted in haste, and could only be constructed at leisure. In these\r\nstraits the private manufacturers of the country were applied to; but in\r\nmany cases they had to learn a new art. Do what they would, with the power\r\nof charging fabulous prices for shot and shell, ammunition, and small\r\narms, their powers of production were totally inadequate to meet the\r\nstrain of the great siege, the proportions of which grew larger day by\r\nday. All the mills in England could not make powder at the rate at which\r\nit was shot away--a rate which consumed 100,000 barrels before Sevastopol\r\nwas taken; nor could all the armouries of London and Birmingham make\r\nrifled muskets and sabres fast enough for our men; consequently we were\r\nobliged to go to Liége for 44,000 Minié guns, 3,000 cavalry swords, and\r\n12,000 barrels of powder, and to the United States for 20,000 barrels\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt may seem passing strange that England, whose manufacturing power is so\r\nenormous, should have to resort to foreign manufacturers for the arms\r\nwherewith to fight. Money in such a country, it is often said, can procure\r\nanything, and money in this case was no object. The want of suitable\r\nmachinery was the cause of the difficulty. The manufacturers could only\r\nmake the articles demanded of them by skilled labour, which is a thing\r\nthat must be acquired before it can be hired. Old machines can be put to\r\nextra duty; fresh machines can be readily supplied; but skilled labour is\r\na fixed capital which cannot be suddenly increased. The result was a\r\nlamentable slowness of production and an extraordinary dearness of\r\nprice--the munitions of war in some cases more than doubled in value. It\r\nis calculated that the shells for the Baltic fleet alone, which were\r\nfabricated entirely by private manufacturers, cost upwards of £100,000\r\nmore than they would have done had they been made by the new machinery\r\nlately introduced into the Arsenal. A still stronger case, to show the\r\nextraordinary prices which the Government had to pay contractors when the\r\ndemand was imperative and supply confined to two or three houses, was that\r\nof the six-pounder diaphragm shells. They were charged by the contractors\r\nat 73_l._ per ton, whilst the very same article is now made in the Royal\r\nLaboratory at 14_l._ 19_s._ 2_d._ per ton. These exorbitant demands and\r\nthe rapid drain of the stores led the War Department to consider whether\r\nit would not be better to organize a government establishment on the most\r\nextensive scale, and on the most improved system; and it was ultimately\r\ndetermined to adopt a plan by which it would be possible to expand or\r\ncontract the productive power, according to the exigencies of the service,\r\nby means of machines which could be tended by untutored labourers and\r\nboys. Accordingly, a very large number of the most ingenious machines\r\nwere procured from the United States, where the Springfield and Harper\r\nFerry Arsenals have long been famous for their admirable contrivances to\r\nsave human skill; while others were procured from the Continent and at\r\nhome by Mr. Anderson, the superintendent of machinery. In a very short\r\ntime a powerful factory of the munitions of war sprung into life,\r\nverifying, for the ten-thousandth time, the truth of the proverb that\r\nnecessity is the mother of invention, or at least, as in this case, of\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of machinery on a large scale put to flight the old\r\ntraditions of the Arsenal, and the manufacturing spirit had to be\r\nsubstituted for the military organization under which the establishment\r\nhad been conducted before. Such was the energy and rapidity with which the\r\nold Arsenal reformed itself, that we question if any private factory in\r\nthe kingdom is conducted upon a better system than is already at work\r\nthere. Within these three years factories have sprung up on every side,\r\nand the whir of wheels, and the measured stroke of the steam-engine, can\r\nnow be heard over the whole of its immense area.\r\n\r\nThe three manufacturing departments into which the Woolwich Arsenal is\r\ndivided are as follows:--The Royal Gun Factory, the Royal Carriage\r\nDepartment, and the Royal Laboratory Department. Through these factories\r\nwe will conduct our readers, and endeavour to give them an idea how human\r\ningenuity has perfected the means to destroy human life. The gun\r\nfactories, by right of age, take precedence, although in point of interest\r\nthey present the least attractive features to the spectator. The fact\r\nwhich most strikes him as he threads his way amid the Cyclopean machinery\r\nis the slow, inevitable manner in which the different processes are\r\ncarried on. Here you see a large lathe turning the outside of an\r\neighteen-pounder, revolving as noiselessly and as readily as though it\r\nwere only turning a brass candlestick--a fixed tool cutting off its thin\r\nshavings of metal with as much ease as if it were box-wood. In the next\r\nmachine a gun is being bored, the drill twisting its way down the fixed\r\nmass, and a dropping shower of bright chips proving how resistlessly its\r\ntooth moves on towards its appointed goal. A third machine cuts off the\r\n\"dead head\" of a cannon. All guns are cast in the pits in a perpendicular\r\nposition, breech downwards, and are made at least one-third longer than\r\nthey are intended to be when finished. The reason for this is, that the\r\nsuperincumbent metal forming the \"dead head\" of the piece may by its\r\nweight condense the portion below it which is to form the true gun--the\r\nextraordinary pressure of the powder requiring the metal to be extremely\r\nclose in order to withstand the strain. Besides these lathes, which do the\r\nmore ordinary work of the factory, there are what are termed exceptional\r\nmachines, to finish those parts of the gun which the lathe cannot touch,\r\nsuch as the projecting sight, the trunnions, and that portion of the\r\nbarrel which lies between them. No increase has taken place in the size of\r\nthe Brass Gun Factory, although, through the energetic action of Colonel\r\nWilmot, its produce has been doubled since the breaking out of the war:\r\nfourteen pieces of brass ordnance--six, nine, and eighteen pounders--can\r\nbe turned out weekly. Brass is used for field-pieces on account of its\r\nresisting power being greater than that of iron. Experiments which have\r\nlately been made, however, tend to show that steel is a far lighter and\r\nbetter material even than brass for this purpose. A German, named Krupp,\r\nhas produced some steel pieces which bear an enormous charge; in fact,\r\nwhen well made, it is almost impossible to burst them. The Emperor of the\r\nFrench has already ordered 350 of these guns to be introduced into the\r\nservice, and probably we shall have to follow suit.\r\n\r\nThe fine building[25] recently erected in connection with this department\r\nis intended for the manufacture of iron ordnance, which has hitherto been\r\nproduced exclusively by private manufacturers. The experience of the late\r\nwar, however, determined the Government to furnish at least a portion of\r\nthese stores themselves. A thoroughly reliable gun must be worth any price\r\nthat its efficient manufacture demands; for the failing of a single piece\r\nmay lose a battle, and bring with it consequences which would be cheaply\r\naverted by a park of artillery cast in gold. In the late campaign we were\r\nprevented from striking a great blow through this very cause alone. At the\r\nbombardment of Sweaborg no less than seventeen of the thirteen-inch\r\nmortars were destroyed through a want of tenacity in the iron of which\r\nthey were composed. Many of these ponderous engines split after a few\r\nrounds, and may now be seen on the wharf of the Arsenal cleft in twain as\r\nclean as Tell's apple. Yet these mortars were made by the Carron and Low\r\nMoor Companies, the most celebrated private manufacturers of such articles\r\nin England. Had they stood the strain, we should have utterly destroyed\r\nthe fortifications of this stronghold, instead of burning a few sheds,\r\nwhich made a great blaze without doing much mischief; and had we possessed\r\na sufficient number of these formidable engines, the destruction of\r\nCronstadt and Sevastopol would only have formed the work of a few days.\r\nThough ours is a land both of iron and manufactures, our guns are of\r\ninferior quality to those of other nations. The cannon captured at\r\nSevastopol are of better iron than the cannon we brought against them.\r\nSeveral thousand tons weight of the guns dismounted from Cronstadt, in\r\norder to make way for pieces of heavier calibre, were bought, we\r\nunderstand, the other day by an English firm with the intention of\r\nconverting them into cranks and boilers, which require the very best\r\nmaterial. The Americans insist upon a tenacity of cast-iron for their\r\nordnance equal to a pressure of 34,000 lbs. on the square inch, and\r\nsometimes obtain it equal to 45,000 lbs., whilst we, the greatest\r\nmanufacturers of iron in the world, have hitherto seldom obtained it of a\r\nstrength equal to 20,000 lbs. This great difficiency Government hope to\r\nremedy by the institution of a series of experiments on all classes of\r\niron both foreign and indigenous. There is a curious machine in the Gun\r\nFactory specially invented for the purpose of testing the tenacity of each\r\nsample, its capacity of withstanding compression, its transverse\r\nstrength, and its power of resisting torsion. It is curious to see this\r\niron-limbed Samson wrestling with mighty bars of metal, and twisting and\r\ntearing them across the grain like bits of stick. The fractured remnants\r\nof the specimens and of the guns rent in the testing process in the\r\nMarshes and at Shoeburyness are collected in a museum, the history of each\r\nspecimen being minutely given. Thus a curious and instructive record is\r\ngradually being acquired, which will prove of infinite use in the\r\nmanufacture of heavy ordnance. It has been already ascertained that guns\r\nare universally strengthened by having wrought iron rings put round\r\nthem--a fact which was discovered during the course of experiments with\r\nthe heavy cannon bored with an oval rifle to receive the Lancaster shell.\r\nSeveral of them having burst at the muzzle, this simple expedient was\r\ntried, and the guns so girded now bear the most extraordinary charges\r\nwithout flinching.\r\n\r\nThe new building for casting, boring, and finishing iron guns, is both\r\nexternally and internally the most imposing-looking of all the structures\r\nerected to meet the exigencies of the Crimean war. These spacious\r\nfactories present more the appearance of first-class railway termini than\r\nof ordinary workshops. They are lighted with what are termed saw-roof\r\nlights, having a northern aspect; for the Vulcans who can work all day in\r\nthe burning blaze of furnaces do not, it appears, like to be distracted\r\nwith the confusing rays of the sun! The number of turning, boring,\r\nfinishing, planing, shaping, drilling, slotting, and punching machines\r\nthat revolve, thump, and slide here in ponderous grandeur is prodigious,\r\nand there can be very little doubt that it will be the most perfect and\r\npowerful factory in the world of its kind. Travelling-cranes, which run\r\nupon railways poised in air overhead, command every inch of the factories,\r\nso that cannon of the heaviest calibre for both land and sea\r\nservice--98-pounders weighing many tons can be slung from machine to\r\nmachine with the greatest ease. When the machinery is completed, the\r\nfoundry will be capable of turning out ten guns of the largest size per\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting portion of the gun department is the factory devoted\r\nto the construction of Lancaster shells. This odd-looking missile has a\r\nform very similar to a champagne bottle, and, unlike the ordinary shell,\r\nis made out of a single sheet of wrought iron. The slab of metal having\r\nbeen welded into a cylindrical form, is submitted to an ingenious lathe,\r\nwhich, acting upon it simultaneously with a dozen different tools inside\r\nand out, speedily reduces it to a given weight and a perfectly uniform\r\nthickness. The cylinder, about eighteen inches in length and ten in\r\ndiameter, is then made red hot, and whilst in this state is placed in the\r\ngrip of a powerful machine, which by a series of blows, equally\r\ndistributed over every part, converts it into the likeness of a French\r\nbottle in less than five minutes, without the slightest sign of crumpling\r\nin any portion of the surface. The operation can only be compared to the\r\nmanner in which a potter shapes a vessel upon the wheel. No less than\r\nforty machines are employed on this special manufacture, and upwards of a\r\nhundred shells can be turned out daily. The expense incurred in producing\r\nwith extreme accuracy and speed these curious missiles for the first\r\nrifled gun adopted by the service, is an earnest of the determination of\r\nthe authorities to carry the manufacture of artillery to the same\r\nperfection of finish as their small arms. Lancaster guns will in all\r\nprobability play a very important part in the next war, if war there\r\nshould ever unhappily be, as those in use in the Crimea made most splendid\r\npractice, firing with nearly the accuracy of a rifle, and attaining a\r\nrange of 5,000 yards, or very nearly three miles. As these shells cost\r\nabout 25_s._ each, the expense of \"passing the bottle\" to the enemy is\r\nrather a serious affair.\r\n\r\nBy far the largest department of the Royal Arsenal is devoted to the\r\nconstruction of carriages and packing-cases for moving artillery, baggage,\r\nand the various munitions of war. At the present moment the carriage\r\ndepartment employs no less than three thousand hands, together with three\r\nhundred machines, moved by twenty-three steam-engines, which do the work\r\nof an additional twelve thousand men! The bulky nature of the material\r\ndealt with, and the store-houses required for stowing it away, together\r\nwith the numerous workshops called into existence by the Crimean war,\r\nhave caused this department to burst its old bounds and to invade 250\r\nacres of the adjoining marsh--the area of the workshops alone covering\r\n255,152 superficial feet, and the entire ground occupied being no less\r\nthan 1,445,440 feet. This immense amount of elbow room has enabled Colonel\r\nTulloch, the superintendent of the department, to systematize the\r\nmanufacture, and cause the timber to pass along in one unbroken progress\r\nfrom the time when it is landed upon the wharf to the time when the\r\nfinished articles are delivered over to the storekeeper. If we follow this\r\nstream from stage to stage, we shall catch a flying view of the operations\r\nof this department, whose province it is to provide package and carriage\r\nfor the British army at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe timber which forms the principal raw material employed is brought by\r\nships to the mouth of the canal which runs along the eastern side of the\r\nArsenal; here it is transferred to lighters which convey it some distance\r\ninland to the quay in the immediate neighbourhood of the timber field. By\r\nmeans of powerful derrick cranes, which can make a long or a short arm at\r\npleasure, it is next unloaded and swung upon the trucks of the railway\r\nwhich ramifies through every portion of the premises, and forms the means\r\nof communication between its different points. The trucks, when full,\r\nimmediately start with their burthen for the contiguous timber field, a\r\nsquare space covering 20 acres. Here the huge logs are deposited in long\r\nlines, which extend from one end of the field to the other, having\r\nroadways between them laid with rails. Over each line or row of timber\r\nstrides a powerful travelling crane which, with a slight impulse given by\r\none man, is made to traverse from end to end of the row, depositing or\r\ntaking up in its way logs of oak or teak of many tons weight as easily as\r\nGulliver could have picked up the Lilliputians he bestrode. Before the\r\nintroduction of this powerful machinery, from fifty to one hundred pairs\r\nof horses were employed in this department alone, all of which are now\r\ndispensed with, and a saving effected of 6,000_l._ a-year.\r\n\r\nThe usual store in the timber-field amounts to 60,000 loads in various\r\nstages of seasoning. The varieties of climate in which the British army\r\nhas to serve are so many, that foreign woods have been introduced to\r\nsupply the place of oak, which cannot be found in quantities equal to the\r\ndemand. Thus we find in the timber-field sabicu, a dense East-Indian wood\r\nwhich is used for the heavy blocks of gun carriages; pedouk, from the same\r\ncountry, which is employed for a similar purpose; and iron bark, an\r\nAustralian wood. Of English timber, such as ash, elm, and beech, there is\r\na very large store. What is called wheel timber, on the soundness and\r\nproper adaptation of which depends the safety of the artillery and\r\ntransport service, is entirely composed of the most graceful trees of our\r\nwoodlands; the spokes being made of oak, the naves of elm, the felloes or\r\nrims of ash. Beech is also largely used for the fuses of shells and the\r\nwoodwork of saddles. When any particular logs are required, they are\r\nselected by the timber-master, picked up by the travelling crane, hoisted\r\ninto the railway truck, and conveyed at once to the saw-mills close at\r\nhand. On the threshold of the largest mill the logs meet with a grim\r\nreception from an immense circular saw 66 inches in diameter, which at\r\nonce attacks the huge log and separates it as expeditiously as your\r\nEastern soldier divides with his scimitar a floating handkerchief. This\r\nformidable instrument traverses a space of 30 feet, and is thus enabled to\r\nfix its teeth upon the log at whatever part of the entrance it may chance\r\nto lie. This transverse section performed, the divided portions are drawn\r\nup by machinery into the saw-frames, the largest of which is capable of\r\nreceiving a log 4 feet square. Once within the mill's maw, as many saws\r\nare put in as are necessary to divide the wood into slabs of the required\r\nthickness, and a few minutes suffice to reduce it to planks. From the\r\nmills the timber is removed again upon the railroad to the seasoning shed,\r\nwhich covers 4 acres of ground. Here it is allowed to remain for years, so\r\nstacked that the air fairly circulates through every portion of the\r\nimmense mass. The seasoning shed is to the timber master what his\r\nwine-cellar is to a _bon vivant_. Here he treasures his bins of nine years\r\nold oak as though it were wine of a famous vintage. This he keeps as\r\ncarefully as a young whist-player keeps his best trumps to the end of the\r\ngame, but with far more judgment, for old oak is precious beyond price,\r\nand cannot be got for love or money at a moment's notice. In the dim\r\nshadow of this monster store are also piled the completed articles of\r\nland-transport that improve by age. That perpendicular wall of finished\r\nwoodwork contains the bodies of a thousand carriages which were prepared\r\nto remove the British army from the pleateau of Sevastopol in anticipation\r\nof an inland campaign; the round towers at the corners are their wheels\r\nbuilt up and left to season. Upon the thorough preparation of this part of\r\nthe carriage its safety depends. The wheels of omnibuses are always\r\nallowed to remain two years before they are used, and by permitting them\r\nthis grace they behave well when at work, generally running over 43,000\r\nmiles of ground before they are worn out. The wheels of gun-carriages\r\nrequire to be even better prepared and seasoned, as they have to bear the\r\nweight of enormous guns, and have often to run over the roughest ground,\r\nwithout being in any way relieved from sudden shocks by springs.\r\n\r\nUpon this store of mellow wood the different factories draw; and the\r\nrailway which traverses every portion of it speedily conveys the raw\r\nmaterial to the benches of the workmen. As the visitor passes up the main\r\navenues of these splendid shops he is bewildered with the activity of the\r\nswarms of artizans, the whirling of shafting, and the grating sounds of\r\ncircular saws. Clouds of sawdust are flying about, and in a moment cover\r\nthe intruder from head to foot. The immense amount of work sometimes\r\nrequired to be performed at a brief notice has necessitated the\r\nintroduction of machinery into this branch of handicraft, which heretofore\r\nwas entirely carried on by manual labour. Let us take the ammunition and\r\npowder cases for instance; these have to be provided by the hundred\r\nthousand in time of war, and accordingly we find machinery employed in\r\nevery direction to shorten the work. Circular saws cut the planks into the\r\nrequired size to form the sides and tops and bottoms of the cases; as\r\nthese issue from the different machines, they are conveyed away upon a\r\ncircular band of canvas, placed at right angles, to a broader band which\r\nruns from one end of the factory to the other: down this band, as on a\r\nbroad stream, the various pieces sail until they reach the receptacle,\r\nfrom which they are again conveyed to the machinery which is to put them\r\ntogether. Here the drilling, mortising, and dowelling processes are\r\ncarried on by wholesale with an exactitude and speed which would astonish\r\nthe joiner of the old school. Upwards of a thousand ammunition boxes\r\nformed of cedar, for repelling the wood-eating white ants of the East, are\r\nnow being prepared daily for the use of the Indian army. The powder-boxes\r\nfor the navy are made of a hexagonal form, to enable them to fit into the\r\nship's hold like cells of honeycomb. They are carefully lined either with\r\npewter or copper, and when filled are hermetically sealed with wax. The\r\nlimber-boxes for the field artillery are also made here in large\r\nquantities. These receptacles are of a far more elaborate character than\r\nthe powder-cases, as they are fitted to take all the stores requisite for\r\nimmediate action, which are stowed away in their different compartments,\r\nas neatly as the articles in a gentleman's dressing-case. The common\r\ncartridge barrels are shaped out of the solid wood almost as fast as you\r\ncan look. One machine cuts the oak into staves, curved to the right form;\r\nanother cuts the edges, so that they may fit in a circle; a fourth turns\r\nthe head; a fifth receives the staves, which are placed by the attendant\r\non end in the form of a barrel, within the grip of a hydraulic press,\r\nclaps a hoop on the top and bottom, and with one squeeze completes the\r\noperation. By such appliances a piece of solid oak plank is converted\r\nwithin five minutes into a finished barrel. The total produce of\r\ncarefully-prepared powder-cases during the financial year 1856 was 25,331,\r\nand of boxes for ammunition, shell, &c., no less than 287,171. How many\r\nbarrels can be made at a pinch we do not know, for the machinery is only\r\njust put up, but the number must be enormous, and when the visitor\r\nwitnesses the nimble fingers of machinery galloping over the work, he\r\nwonders how the business was ever got through in the old time of the\r\nchisel, gouge, hammer, and plane.\r\n\r\nIn the shops devoted to the manufacture of the gun-carriages and trucks\r\nfor the land and sea service, skilled artisans are employed, except in the\r\nwheel department. The vast strength requisite to support and withstand the\r\nrecoil of 56, 64, and 98-pounders, necessitates the most solid\r\nconstruction and the best workmanship. Some of these platforms for\r\ntraversing cannon, made of teak, and bolted and finished at the ends with\r\nbright copper bands, look like handsome pieces of furniture rather than\r\nship's gun-carriages. Compared with these ponderous articles, the light\r\nconstructions fitted for the field-artillery seem like children's\r\nplaythings. Here they may be met with in every variety and in every stage\r\nof progress, so substantially put together that the marvel is that they\r\never wear out. The sort of succession of earthquakes, however, to which\r\nthey are subjected in a campaign tells even upon those solid joints, and\r\nbut few of the gun-carriages employed in the Crimea, although new when\r\nthey went out, returned fit for further service.\r\n\r\nThe wheel department is one of the most interesting sights in the Arsenal.\r\nHere the most ingenious machinery has been brought together to insure\r\nsound and speedy production. Formerly the wheels were made entirely by\r\nhand; now they are turned out without the aid of a single skilled\r\nwheelwright. What is called the copying process, produces the nave and\r\nspokes of the wheel, three or four of which are seen working side by side,\r\nand the whole batch under the care of only one man. The circular rim of\r\nthe wheel, or felloe, is cut out of the solid block by an ingenious\r\nribbon-saw, imported from France. This saw is merely a narrow band of\r\nsteel, toothed on one edge and running over a wheel like an ordinary\r\nleathern band attached to shafting. The exquisite manner in which it\r\nfashions the most intricate patterns from thick slabs of wood is really\r\nsurprising. The felloes, after being thus roughly formed, are stacked to\r\nseason in a shed by themselves, where they are piled one upon the other in\r\nvast pillars, down vistas of which the visitor passes, full of amazement\r\nat their number. There are at present in store some sixty thousand of\r\nthese felloes and an equal number of naves, with their due complement of\r\nspokes.\r\n\r\nAs wheels are required, their component parts are brought to the shop,\r\nfinished and mortised by machinery, and then lightly adjusted to each\r\nother. They are immediately placed within the grip of six hydraulic\r\npresses, which are so arranged as to thrust towards a common centre.\r\nDirectly the wheel is adjusted within them, you hear the hiss of the\r\nresistless engines, whose motive power is only a few pints of water; the\r\nsolid timbers groan, the joints painfully accommodate themselves to each\r\nother, and in less time than the process takes to describe, the wheel is\r\nlifted out solidly jointed, and only awaiting the tire to travel at once\r\nunder its superincumbent gun. The wheels of gun, limber, and ammunition\r\ncarriages are all made of exactly the same size, in order that they may be\r\ninterchangeable in case of accident.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the sudden outbreak of the late war was, perhaps, more\r\nbeneficially felt upon the laboratory department of the Arsenal than any\r\nother. Shells, of all the stores of war, were most deficient when the army\r\nleft for Varna, and the want increased as soon as actual campaigning\r\ncommenced. The authorities accordingly permitted Captain Boxer to erect a\r\nmodel manufactory of shells in the autumn of 1855. This he did with\r\nsurprising rapidity, and proved to their satisfaction that these\r\nformidable missiles could be manufactured five pounds a ton cheaper than\r\nthey could be procured from the contractors--an important saving on an\r\narticle of which several hundred tons had to be supplied per day. The\r\nsuccess of this experiment led to the erection of the splendid\r\nshell-foundry which is now attached to the Arsenal, and which is capable\r\nof turning out sufficient shells for all the armies of the world. Here may\r\nbe seen the process by which the old scrap iron of the establishment is\r\ntransformed into the finished shot and shell, and transferred by its own\r\nweight to the transport ready to convey it to the seat of war. The\r\nsmelting process is carried on in a dozen enormous cupola furnaces, into\r\nwhich the iron and coal are heaped indiscriminately. The fierce heat\r\ngenerated by the blast rapidly melts the iron, which is then allowed to\r\nflow into the shell-moulds. From the moment the metal enters these moulds,\r\nthe shell, in war time, never touches the ground till it is landed at its\r\nport of debarkation! The rough shells, after they have cooled a little,\r\nare forwarded by railway to the cleaning-room, where they are placed in a\r\nrevolving iron barrel, seven feet long and seven feet in diameter. This\r\nmachine circulates with rapidity, and the friction of the contained shells\r\nspeedily cleanses them of all sand and dirt. From this point they roll\r\nthrough all the succeeding stages of their manufacture. A\r\nslightly-inclined plane receives them at the cleaning-drum, and conducts\r\nthem one by one to the machinery fixed in the great room of the laboratory\r\ndepartment. Upwards of ten thousand shells per day passed through this\r\napartment during the late war, and were, on their passage, drilled and\r\n\"bushed,\" or fitted with the socket made to receive the fuse. This simple\r\nfact will alone serve to show how energetically the work was carried on to\r\nmeet the wants of the great siege. The shells, having rolled through the\r\nlabyrinth of successive machines which operate upon them, now move onward\r\nto the painting department, where they receive a coating of black varnish,\r\nwhich prevents oxidation. Hence they continue their journey right across\r\nthe open ground of the Arsenal to the pier, under the platform of which\r\nthey keep their course inside an iron tube which leads immediately into\r\nthe barge alongside the transport in the river. From this barge, into\r\nwhich they sometimes shoot with a considerable impulse, they roll again,\r\nthrough the open port of the ship, to their appointed place in the hold.\r\n\r\nThe chief factory of the laboratory department is the great sight of the\r\nArsenal, as here the visitor witnesses twenty or thirty most curious\r\noperations, the more important only of which he can stop to examine amid\r\nthe whirlwind of machinery that everywhere meets his sight and vibrates on\r\nhis ear. The manufacture of elongated bullets for the rifles affords\r\nperhaps the most startling novelty of all. The rifle itself is not a\r\ngreater advance upon old Brown Bess than is the Minié bullet upon the old\r\none-ounce ball. The apparatus now employed to produce it contrasts as\r\nforcibly with the simple bullet-mould formerly in use. Instead of heating\r\nthe lead to a fluid state, it is simply warmed, in which condition it is\r\nsubjected to hydraulic pressure in a large iron vessel, which has but one\r\nsmall aperture at the top, of the size of the intended elongated bullet.\r\nOut of this hole the metal is driven in the form of a continuous rod of\r\nlead, which, as it issues forth, rolls itself upon iron reels as though it\r\nwere so much cotton! The reels are then attached to a machine which draws\r\nthe metal between its teeth, bites it off to the required size, moulds the\r\ncone, depresses the cup, and condenses the mass at the same moment. These\r\nwonderful bullet-makers, when in full work, turn out five hundred\r\nelongated bullets a minute, or upwards of a quarter of a million daily. To\r\ncomplete the missile, the cup has to be filled with a boxwood plug to\r\nensure its proper expansion whilst in the act of leaving the gun. Here\r\nagain a partially self-acting apparatus is called into play, one lad being\r\nsufficient to feed several machines with square rods of wood, the ends of\r\nwhich are embraced by a circular hollow cutter, which instantly reduces\r\nthem to the right conical form, and then cuts them off. These little plugs\r\nare produced at the same rate as the bullets.\r\n\r\nAn equally interesting operation is the manufacture of percussion caps.\r\nThe first process in this light and delicate work is the stamping of\r\nsheet-copper into pieces of the required form to make the caps. For this\r\npurpose the copper is placed beneath the punch of the machine, and\r\nimmediately it is put in action, small crosses of metal are seen to fall\r\nfrom it into a box in a continual stream, whilst the sheet itself is\r\ntransposed by the punching process into a kind of trellis-work. These\r\ncrosses of equilateral arms are now transferred to another machine, which\r\ninstantly doubles up the four arms, and at the same time so rounds them,\r\nthat they form a tube just the size of the gun-nipple, and by a third\r\noperation of the same machine a kind of rim is given to the free end,\r\nwhich makes the cap take the form of a hat. This rim marks the difference\r\nbetween the military and the ordinary percussion cap--the soldier, in the\r\nhurry and confusion of battle, requiring this guide to enable him to\r\napply the proper end to the nipple. The metal portion of the cap\r\ncompleted, it is transferred to a man who fills it with detonating powder.\r\nAs this is a very dangerous process, the artisan upon whom the duty\r\ndevolves sits apart from the boys, who perform all the other work, for\r\nfear of an accidental explosion. To fix the fine dust in the cap, a very\r\npretty machine is employed, which gets through its work with extreme\r\nrapidity. The caps are placed in regular rows in a frame-work, to which is\r\nattached a lever, armed with as many fine points as there are caps in a\r\nsingle row. The motion given by the hand alternately dips these fine\r\npoints into a tray of varnish, and then into each succeeding line of caps.\r\nWhen the varnish is dry, the powder is fixed and effectually protected\r\nfrom the effects of damp. The caps are now finished, and are ready for the\r\nboy who counts and packs them. Machinery is even employed to perform the\r\npart of cocker, and with one gentle shake does the brain-work of many\r\nminutes. A frame is constructed, into which fit a number of small trays,\r\neach tray being pierced with seventy-five holes. Upon this frame the boy\r\nheaps up a few handfuls of caps, and then gives the whole machine a few\r\njerks, and when he sees that every hole is filled with a cap, he lifts out\r\neach separate tray and empties it into appropriate boxes. In this manner\r\nhe is enabled, with extreme rapidity, to count out his parcels of\r\nseventy-five caps, the regulation number served to each soldier with sixty\r\nrounds of ball-cartridge--the excess of fifteen being allowed for loss in\r\nthe flurry of action. The British soldier's clumsy fingers are by no means\r\nwell calculated for handling and adjusting such light articles.\r\n\r\nEqually curious with the production of caps is the manufacture of\r\ncartridge-bags. The visitor, as he mounts the stairs to the upper floor of\r\na large building close at hand, is made aware by the hum and collision of\r\nshrill young voices that he is approaching a hive of children, and as he\r\nrears his head above the banisters, he finds that he is in the midst of a\r\nlittle army of urchins, varying from eight to fourteen years of age,\r\nseated at long benches rolling up paper cartridge-bags. This process\r\nrequires some little nicety, as each bag is made up of three distinct\r\npapers of different sizes and shapes, which have to be neatly adjusted\r\nround a roller one upon another. By long practice some of these little\r\nfellows complete the operation in a surprisingly short space of\r\ntime--rolling, twisting in the end, tying, and drawing it from the rod\r\nalmost as quickly as you can look at them, the swaying of the body during\r\nthe operation giving to the entire mass of eight hundred children a most\r\nextraordinary aggregate movement as the room is surveyed from one end to\r\nthe other. Some boys are infinitely more nimble-fingered than others, and\r\nthe sharpest earn eight or nine shillings a-week at the work.\r\n\r\nNimble as their little fingers ply, however, the hands of machinery laugh\r\nthem to scorn. In the room below we note as we descend strange wheel-like\r\nframes revolving horizontally, and others working up and down into tanks\r\nof paper pulp. These are the new machines destined to supplant the little\r\nchildren over-head, and to hush the ceaseless hum of their human labour.\r\nThroughout the entire range of the Arsenal there is no sight more\r\ninteresting than is exhibited by these machines, the _modus operandi_ of\r\nwhich is extremely simple. Circles of brass tubing have short upright\r\ntubes inserted into them at regular distances. These upright tubes, or\r\nfingers, are pierced with fine holes, and the whole apparatus is attached\r\nto an exhausting-pump. Worsted mittens are fitted to the fingers, and when\r\nall is ready, the Briarean hand is dipped into the bath of pulp, the air\r\nin the tubes is withdrawn, the liquid necessarily rushes towards the\r\nfingers, and the water passing through, leaves the pulp adherent to the\r\nmitten. The process is instantaneous, hand after hand drops into the\r\ntrough, gloves its fingers with pulp, and rises with a thousand cartridges\r\nin its grasp, quicker than one of the boys up stairs has finished a single\r\nbag. The process is not complete, however, until they are dry. Each mitten\r\nis removed from its metal finger, and placed on a similar one heated with\r\nsteam. In ten minutes the desiccating process is finished, and the\r\ncartridge-bag is removed, a far more perfect instrument for its deadly\r\npurpose than that which is made up stairs by hand. The hint for this\r\nbeautiful machine was taken from the apparatus employed for making\r\nconical seamless sugar-bags without the intervention of the paper\r\nmaker--so diverse are the developments which may spring from the same\r\nidea. Of these small-arm cartridge-bags, 400,000 can be manufactured in a\r\nday of ten hours; but as each cartridge is composed of a double envelope,\r\none fitting within the other, in order to separate the conical ball from\r\nthe powder, the product furnishes 200,000 cartridges--an enormous\r\nquantity, but scarcely equal to the demand of such campaigners as\r\nHavelock, whose men, day by day, consumed their sixty rounds per head. At\r\nfirst sight it seems strange to find the Government turned paper makers,\r\nand the visitor may think that these bags could be obtained, as the\r\nsugar-bags are by the grocers, from the private manufacturer, but it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that they should be produced side by side with their\r\ndeadly contents. They are far more delicate things to maintain in their\r\nintegrity than even wafer-biscuits, which they very much resemble, and\r\nthey are required in such enormous numbers, that any mechanical\r\nimpediment, such as crushing, interposed to the filling of them with\r\npowder and ball, would add immensely to the expense. The pressure in\r\npacking necessary to convey them to the Arsenal would flatten, and hence\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\nBut where, asks the visitor, is the small-arms factory for the\r\nconstruction of those far-famed rifles which prevented a disaster at\r\nInkermann, and at once doubled the effective power of the steadiest\r\ninfantry of Europe? And well may he ask the question, for what more\r\nnatural place for this important manufacture than in connexion with\r\nkindred Government establishments? When the War Office decided upon\r\nerecting a factory to meet the sudden demands of the war, it was proposed\r\nby the Inspector of Machinery to plant it within the walls of the Arsenal;\r\nbut the authorities, for some reason best known to themselves, decided\r\notherwise, and it was accordingly taken to Enfield Lock, which is twelve\r\nmiles from London on the Eastern Counties Railway, and where they had\r\nbefore a small establishment for the repair and manufacture of a limited\r\nnumber of muskets. The traveller who gets out at the factory station\r\nfinds himself at once in a road which leads him into a flat country laced\r\nwith streams, where Paul Potter might have found a study at every turn.\r\nHere, amid flocks and herds peacefully grazing, or standing in the shadows\r\nof the pollard willows, he espies the tall chimneys of the Enfield\r\nfactory, looking like a stray fragment of Manchester that had wandered out\r\nof its way. In all England a more absurd spot for it could not have been\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nThe establishment, however, is so worthy of a minute inspection, that we\r\nwill proceed to give a general view of the whole. The threshold of the\r\nmanufacturing process is the smithery, where the foreman presides to\r\ndeliver out the raw material and receive in return the work done. To each\r\nsmith is issued the particular size of bar iron or steel required for the\r\narticle he works upon. Opening out of this shop is the smithery itself,\r\nwith its fifty-five forges, together with steam hammers, hoppers, rider\r\nhammers, and other contrivances by which our modern Vulcan economises\r\nlabour. In this department all the iron and steel work of the lock and\r\nstock are moulded, for the ordinary method of forging conveys a very\r\ninadequate idea of the manner in which the material is here manipulated.\r\nEvery sportsman knows that the lock of a gun is made up of many small\r\npieces of irregular form. To forge these with the hammer alone would be\r\nfar too expensive a process, as it would require highly-skilled labour,\r\nnor even then would it be possible to produce the different pieces of\r\nexactly the same size, so that any one may fit into any other with perfect\r\naccuracy when the gun is ultimately put together. To accomplish this end,\r\nthe essential principle of the manufacture, each smith with his helper\r\ntakes in hand a particular piece of work. One man, for instance, makes\r\nhammers, or cocks, as sportsmen call them. The irregular form of this part\r\nof the lock would seem to preclude the possibility of its being made by\r\nthe hundred-thousand, each one being the counterpart of its brother to the\r\nthousandth of an inch. Yet this is done, and with an ease that appears\r\nastonishing to the beholder. Let us watch the brawny smith before us. He\r\ndraws a rod from the fire at white heat, lays it upon an indented part of\r\nhis anvil, and, together with his mate, deals alternate blows in half a\r\ndozen different directions, and produces in a few seconds an irregular\r\nmass, which we see bears a resemblance to the indentation in the anvil,\r\nwhich, on closer inspection, we find to be a rude matrix of a guncock.\r\nThis is the first process, called swaging. These two men go on from one\r\nyear's end to another, giving alternate light and heavy blows and taps on\r\nall sides of the metal. These blows, though sometimes delivered through a\r\nswinging circle of eight or ten feet, fall upon exactly the same spot, for\r\npractice so nicely co-ordinates the muscles as to produce a motion as\r\nexact as that which draws from the bow of a Paganini the same delicate\r\nnote for any number of times in succession. The cock thus swaged, the\r\nsmith stamps his initials upon it, and transfers it to another smith, who\r\nworks with a steam-hammer, on which is a steel die of the exact form it is\r\nrequired to take. A single blow of this instrument gives it its final\r\nform, leaving the superfluous metal in the shape of a thin film, where it\r\nhas been squeezed into the opening between the dies, which is cut off by a\r\nsubsequent stamping process. By this method of swaging and stamping, the\r\nlock-plate, bridle, cock, sear, trigger, sightleaf, breech-screw, and\r\nswivel are formed so perfectly, that the tool is scarcely required to\r\ntouch them afterwards.\r\n\r\nThose parts of the lock made of steel, such as the mainspring, searspring\r\nand tumbler, are simply swaged, the stamping process being omitted on\r\naccount of the sudden blow tending to break the grain and thus destroy the\r\nelasticity of the metal.\r\n\r\nA curious operation of the smithery is the bayonet forging. The bars for\r\nbayonet-work are never forged of such uniform width as to allow the smith\r\nto cut off to a nicety the length he requires. In order to rectify this\r\ndifficulty, and enable him to tell how much will serve his purpose, he is\r\nprovided with a water-gauge, or tube filled with a given quantity of\r\nwater; into this the rod is plunged, and withdrawn when the fluid reaches\r\nthe top of the gauge. By this expedient the iron, however irregular in\r\nform, is measured accurately by the displacement of the water. When the\r\nbar is withdrawn, the smith cuts it off at the watermark, and his mate\r\nthrusts it into the forge fire. Whilst this is going on, the visitor\r\nbecomes conscious of a strange machine close at hand, which perpetually\r\ngnashes together a mouthful of hardened steel teeth; this is that useful\r\ninstrument called the rider hammer. These teeth bear upon their upper and\r\nunder surfaces grooves of the form the iron bar is required to take. The\r\nshort white-heated bit of bar is thrust in, and by a series of nabs is\r\ninstantly lengthened a couple of inches; the next tooth still further\r\nattenuates it, the third forces it into the triangular form, and a fourth\r\nand fifth reduce it to the graduated length required: thus the blade of\r\nthis terrible weapon is rough-drawn. The ring by which it is attached to\r\nthe barrel of the musket is forged separately, and welded to the shank at\r\nright angles. These are the first of at least seventy-six distinct\r\noperations before the weapon is fitted to fulfil its appointed design,\r\nthat of making the ugliest and most irreparable wound possible in the\r\nhuman corpus. The work done, it is returned to the foreman, whose first\r\nduty is to see that the material with which the man has been debited has\r\nwrought into the requisite number of pieces; if it falls short the waste\r\nis charged to him. The next scrutiny is into the quality of the work, and\r\nthe last and not the least important inquiry is, does it gauge? Unless the\r\nwork passes all these ordeals it is rejected, and the person in fault is\r\nknown by the distinguishing mark of the smith who prepared it. In some\r\ncases, as in the making of the bands which bind the barrel to the stock,\r\nthis mark is ground off in passing through one of the presses; but is\r\nimmediately restored, that the work may be traced to the artisan who\r\nconstructed it. The effect of thus fixing the responsibility of every\r\nsingle thing manufactured upon the maker is immense, and induces habits of\r\ncarefulness such as are seldom seen in ordinary workmen. The foreman now\r\nissues the different pieces to the finishers, who convey them to the\r\nannealing room, where they are rendered soft for working by heat, and\r\ncleaned of their scale or oxide, which would otherwise injure the tool, by\r\nmeans of dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe barrel is welded and finished in a separate factory. The piece of\r\nmetal out of which the gradually tapering tube is ultimately fashioned\r\nseems to bear no relation to such a form. You see the smith take a small\r\nplate of quarter-inch iron, about a foot long by a few inches wide, heat\r\nit to a welding heat, and then place it between the lips of a rolling\r\nmill, with grooved instead of flat rollers, and in an instant it comes out\r\na tube. It has next to be drawn out to the requisite length and tapered,\r\nwhich is done by passing it through a series of mills, each succeeding one\r\nbeing grooved smaller than the preceding. The bore is kept hollow during\r\nthe operation by a central iron rod. The breech piece is welded on by a\r\nsingle blow of a steam-hammer, and the process of turning the bore begins.\r\nFour barrels are acted upon by one lathe, and the first operation is\r\nperformed in fifteen minutes. Only a slight cutting is made each time, and\r\nthe barrel has to be submitted to the action of many different boring\r\ninstruments until the exact size, ·577 of an inch, is attained. The\r\noutside is now turned, the tool taking off the superfluous metal in one\r\ncontinuous ringlet of iron.\r\n\r\nIt now undergoes the most delicate process of all, that of being \"viewed.\"\r\nThe viewer, who is a highly-skilled workman, with an exceedingly accurate\r\neye, puts himself opposite a gas-lamp, about thirty feet distance, and\r\nwhich has a dark shade on its upper side. Towards this object he directs\r\nthe barrel so as to bring the dark edge half-way across his sight as he\r\nlooks through the bore. By this device he is enabled to direct a ray of\r\nlight with a defined edge down the tube, and by turning the barrel round,\r\ninstantly detects the slightest deviation from the straight line. As the\r\nsmoothest-looking sea is discovered to be a mass of dimpling ripples--(the\r\nGreek poet's \"infinite laughings of the sea\")--when the setting sun throws\r\na golden shaft across its bosom, so the mathematically straight lines of\r\nlight gauge the inequalities of the rifle bore in a more exact manner than\r\nany instrument that has yet been invented. When any irregularities are\r\ndiscovered, the viewer taps the barrel with a fine hammer on a small\r\nanvil, and repeats the operation until the tube is perfectly true. Upon\r\nthis depends the correct shooting of the gun, inasmuch as the least crook\r\nnear the end of the bore would send a bullet far on one side of the mark\r\nlong before it had attained the full range of 800 yards, to which the\r\nEnfield rifle is sighted. The rifling of the barrel in three groves is\r\nperformed by fixing it in a lathe, and driving the cutter through it in a\r\nspiral direction.\r\n\r\nIn entering the finishing room, a noble apartment, 200 feet square, the\r\nvisitor cannot fail to be struck with astonishment at the scene this vast\r\nworkshop presents. He looks through a mass of wheels, levers, cranks, and\r\nshafts, which fill the space from wall to wall, every foot alive with iron\r\nand human limbs, and the whole superficies seeming to writhe and wrestle\r\nlike a cluster of worms. Although confusion looks triumphant to the casual\r\neye, the utmost order prevails. On one side of the room, at regular\r\nintervals, small inclosed offices, with glazed fronts, are placed against\r\nthe wall, a little above the level of the floor. These are devoted to the\r\nforemen of the different divisions into which the work is separated. Each\r\nof these functionaries from his eyrie rakes the long avenues or streets of\r\nmachines, with their attendant workmen, which run in parallel lines across\r\nthe room. The first avenue is devoted to bayonets; then come in the\r\nfollowing order the divisions allocated to furniture, screw, sight, lock,\r\nand stock. The work is so managed that all the different parts keep pace\r\ntogether, and are finished in the required proportions; or in other words,\r\nthose pieces which are but slowly produced have allotted to them a greater\r\nnumber of machines. By this arrangement all the requisite items are\r\nbrought at the same moment to the workmen who put them together in the\r\nfinished article. The fifty-six pieces of which the rifle is composed work\r\ntheir way up one street of machinery and down another, constantly\r\nfollowing on from right to left on their way towards the top of the room.\r\nMany of these pieces are passed through upwards of twenty different\r\nmachines, each one performing some simple and definite action, by which\r\nmeans an accuracy is obtained that the most skilful gunmaker could never\r\nequal by hand.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of cutting-tools in these different machines strikes the\r\nobserver with astonishment; the oddest shapes, the most unlikely-looking\r\nforms, proving admirably adapted for the purposes they are intended to\r\naccomplish. Many of these work automatically--that is, they engage and\r\ndisengage themselves; setting to work only when they are fed with\r\nmaterial, and, when their rodent-like teeth have gnawed away as much metal\r\nas is requisite, they stop of their own accord. The effect of this is so\r\nextraordinary, that it almost seems as if those bright limbs of iron,\r\nwhich stop and move on without human agency, must be directed by some sort\r\nof metallic brain. The most common form of tool employed is what is termed\r\nthe circular cutter or milling-tool, which is constructed to fit every\r\nclass of work. These cutters will continue serviceable for months without\r\nrequiring to be sharpened, in consequence of each being restricted to its\r\nown limited sphere. The amount of thought employed in the construction of\r\nmany of these machines must have been immense, and when they were\r\ncompleted, two-thirds of the manufacturing difficulty was overcome, and\r\nthe musket more than half made. A most ingenious machine, the parent of a\r\nnumerous progeny, was, many years ago, invented by an Englishman, and\r\napplied to copying the fine lines of statuary, and transferring them to\r\nivory and other materials. The applicability of this instrument to the\r\nproduction of the irregular forms in the gun trade was first perceived by\r\nour cousins across the Atlantic, and for many years they have employed it\r\nfor the rapid and true production of many parts of the musket, whilst our\r\nown manufacturers in London and Birmingham have been content to execute\r\nthe same work, laboriously and expensively, by hand labour. The copying\r\nmachines now at Enfield have been imported direct from America. They are\r\nprincipally employed in fashioning gun-stocks. They convert the rough\r\nslabs of walnut-wood, just outlined in the proper form, which come from\r\nFrance, Belgium and Italy, into the finished article, with all its\r\ngrooves, holes, and beddings for lock and barrel. This extraordinary\r\napparatus may be said to work with two hands: the one feeling the outline\r\nof the pattern to be copied, the other directing a tool uniformly with it\r\nand cutting the object to the required form. Let us, for example, take the\r\nmachine that hollows out the lock-bedding in the stock. Not only are the\r\noutlines of the most irregular form, but they are sunk to three different\r\nlevels, and it would almost seem impossible that a machine should excavate\r\nso complex a bedding with minute accuracy. Nevertheless, it is done in a\r\nfew minutes by an apparatus, which revolves and brings, one after the\r\nother, some new tool into play according to the work to be done. Whilst\r\nthe operation is going on, a little blower clears out the chips as\r\ncleverly as though the machine had human breath. The different portions of\r\nthe gun completed, they are, for the last time, gauged, and passed on to\r\nthe extreme end bench of the factory, near the west door, where the\r\n\"assembler,\" as he is termed, receives them in different bins, from which\r\nhe takes the part he requires and sets up the gun. As there is no\r\nnecessity for special fitting, this process is performed with remarkable\r\nrapidity, seven minutes being sufficient to combine all the different\r\nparts, which have never been near each other before--lock, stock, ramrod,\r\nand bayonet--into the complete weapon. They now pass out of the western\r\ndoor, packed in cases, and are taken to the proving-ground, where they are\r\ntested with high charges and their range and accuracy duly examined; and\r\nso perfect is the finish, that not one in a thousand fails to stand the\r\ntrying ordeal. They are now transferred by water to the Armoury at the\r\nTower, ready for service in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Enfield rifle was adopted for the public service in the year 1853, and\r\nis at the present moment the best infantry musket in Europe. There is\r\nstill room, however, as Mr. Whitworth has shown, for improvement in the\r\nbarrel. His rifle propels a bullet both farther and with greater accuracy,\r\nin consequence of the greater care he bestows upon the barrel, which,\r\ninstead of being welded, is bored, at a great cost, out of the solid\r\nmetal. Its diameter also being smaller, the bullet encounters a less\r\nresistance in the air during its flight. There is no reason why the\r\nsmaller bore should not be substituted for that of the Enfield rifle,\r\nwhen this arm would be perfect. The difficulty the ablest minds experience\r\nin getting out of an old groove was exemplified by the late Duke of\r\nWellington with respect to this question of the size of bore. His Grace\r\nwas obstinately wedded to Brown Bess, whose crushing fire, so superior to\r\nthat of the enemy, he had witnessed in his Peninsular campaigns, and which\r\nhe erroneously ascribed to the excellent quality of the arm instead of to\r\nthe steadiness of the men--mistaking, in fact, a moral for a physical\r\nexcellence. The longer the Commander-in-Chief lived, the firmer his faith\r\nin the large smooth bore, and the necessity for making a big hole in the\r\nenemy. When the rifle-musket of 1851 replaced this old arm, the large bore\r\nwas still retained, and the consequence was, that the bullet, being\r\nelongated, was heavier than when round, and the soldier had to carry a\r\nmissile of 696 grains weight, instead of 490 grains. The bore of the\r\nEnfield rifle pattern of 1853 was very properly reduced, and the Prichett\r\nexpanding bullet, of 530 grains, now carries its deadly weight in its\r\nlength. Though the wound it gives is not so large as that inflicted by the\r\nold ball, it makes up for deficiency by its power of penetration. An\r\nofficer who was at the taking of the rifle-pits in the quarry before\r\nSevastopol informs us that a brother-officer was shot through the side by\r\na Russian Minié bullet, which afterwards passed through an ass, and his\r\ntwo panniers of water, and did not stop in its career till it had broken a\r\nman's arm at some distance off! Its deadly aim at vast distances, which\r\nmade it the dread of the sepoys, who termed it \"the gun that kills without\r\nmaking any sound,\" contrasts strangely with the performances of Brown Bess\r\nof old, which at any range beyond a hundred yards was so uncertain in its\r\naim that it has been calculated that the soldier shot away the weight in\r\nlead of every man that he hit.\r\n\r\nBefore the breaking out of the war, our stores were hampered with\r\nsmall-arms of all sizes and patterns. There were, at home and abroad, no\r\nless than 109,725 flint-lock muskets, of fifteen different patterns, and\r\n107,000 smooth-bore, percussion-lock muskets, of eight different patterns.\r\nVery many of these were in service a few years ago; and as their bores\r\nwere all dissimilar, it often happened that the soldiers were provided\r\nwith cartridges that would not fit their guns. In peace little\r\ndifficulties of this kind are of no moment, but they are of the utmost\r\nimportance in the time of war. At the battle of Waterloo, the\r\nBrunswickers, who held Hougoumont, were, for a short time, rendered\r\nhelpless, in consequence of cartridges having been sent to them that did\r\nnot fit their muskets. A battle, which, according to Professor Creasey,\r\nranks among the six decisive combats of the world, might thus have been\r\nlost on account of the misfit of a cartridge. The necessity of preventing\r\nthe possible recurrence of such mischances induced the authorities, at the\r\nbreaking out of the Russian war, to make the bore of all muskets used by\r\nthe different branches of the service uniform with that of the Enfield\r\nrifle. A thousand of these weapons can at present be completed in a\r\nweek--a number which appears large, but which is in reality far beneath\r\nthe real wants of the army. The private manufacturers of small-arms in\r\nBirmingham denounced the establishment of this factory, on the plea that\r\nGovernment were not warranted in fabricating goods which the private trade\r\nof the country were capable of producing--an assertion which the Crimean\r\nwar totally disproved, as the authorities were so pressed for rifles that\r\nthey had to go to France,[26] Belgium, and the United States for supplies,\r\nand at one time contemplated giving an order for 350,000 rifles at Liége.\r\nThe military rifle, like the shell, being a special article required only\r\nby the army, the demand for it in large numbers is not constant, and hence\r\nthe low condition of the mechanical power brought to bear upon it by the\r\ntrade. The gunmakers of Birmingham have depended upon skilled labour for\r\nthe production of the different parts of a musket, and thus labour, in\r\ntimes of pressure, becomes exorbitantly costly, to the embarrassment and\r\nloss of the public service. It was this which led the Government to\r\nintroduce machinery into the manufacture--a thing the trade declared\r\nimpossible, but which they now see is not only possible but profitable,\r\nsince the same musket for which they charged 4_l._ 10_s._ is now made of a\r\nsuperior quality by the Government for 3_l._ 15_s._ The experiment must be\r\nof the greatest importance to the Birmingham gun trade, which, through its\r\nown inherent vices, was fast yielding to the superior ingenuity of America\r\nand Belgium, and which can only regain its old position by taking a lesson\r\nfrom the organized mechanical resources of the Enfield Lock manufactory.\r\nThe private manufacturers need not fear that Enfield will monopolize even\r\nGovernment work, the demands of the service being far beyond its\r\nproductive powers. As the Ordnance supplies rifles to our army in India,\r\nas well as to the home and colonial force, no less than 400,000 are\r\nrequired for the infantry and marines alone: a number which has to be\r\nreplaced every twelve years, even in times of peace. In active service the\r\ndestruction is immense; and now the cycle of war has returned, the annual\r\n50,000 rifles turned out by the royal factory will prove but a small\r\ninstalment of the vast store of arms that England will require.\r\n\r\nAt Waltham Abbey, not half an hour's walk from Enfield Lock, is situated\r\nthe only establishment for the manufacture of powder which the Government\r\npossesses. Here dispersion, instead of concentration, is the order of the\r\nday. The necessity for complete isolation causes the factories to be\r\ndistributed over a very large space of ground, and the visitor has to walk\r\nfrom workshop to workshop through groves and avenues of willow and alder,\r\nas though he were visiting dispersed farm-buildings rather than the\r\ndifferent departments of the same manufacturing process. There are not\r\nperhaps more than a dozen detached buildings in the whole establishment,\r\nyet these are scattered over upwards of fifty acres of ground. To such an\r\nextent do meadows and woods and meandering canals predominate, that the\r\nidea of being in a powder-mill is entirely lost in the impression that you\r\nare walking in a Dutch landscape. The visitor who enters the great gates\r\nof the mill, impressed with a belief in the dangerous nature of the ground\r\nhe is treading, is somewhat startled on finding a steam-engine at work on\r\nthe very threshold of the factory, and a tall chimney smoking its pipe in\r\nwhat he supposed to be the vicinity of hundreds of barrels of gunpowder;\r\nbut in reality these boilers and furnaces are placed many hundred feet\r\nfrom the mixing-houses. The English Government powder is composed of\r\nseventy-five parts of saltpetre, fifteen parts of charcoal, and ten of\r\nsulphur. The ingredients, being thoroughly powdered, prepared, and\r\npurified, are submitted to the action of a machine, which completely mixes\r\nthem. The product is then conveyed by a covered boat, very much like an\r\naldermanic gondola in mourning, some hundred yards along the canal to the\r\nincorporating houses, where the most important process of the manufacture\r\nis carried on, and where the danger of an explosion first commences. The\r\nincorporating machine is nothing more than a couple of runners or huge\r\nwheels, weighing four and a half tons each, which revolve one after\r\nanother on their edges in a bed of metal supplied with a deep wooden rim,\r\nwhich gives it much the appearance of a huge kitchen candlestick. Into\r\nthis dish the black powder is placed, together with a little water, which\r\nvaries in quantity, from four pints in winter, when the atmosphere is\r\ncharged with moisture, to ten in the summer, when the desiccating quality\r\nof the air is very great. For four hours this pasty mass is crushed,\r\nground, and mixed by the action of the runners. The precautions taken\r\nagainst explosion teach the visitor the dangerous nature of the ground he\r\nis treading. Before he puts his feet across the threshold he must encase\r\nthem in leathern boots huge enough to fit Polyphemus, and guiltless of\r\niron in any form whatever; even his umbrella or stick is snatched from\r\nhim, lest the ferrule should strike fire, or accidentally drop among any\r\npart of the machinery whilst at work. The machinery is even protected\r\nagainst itself. In order to avoid the possibility of the linch-pins which\r\nconfine the cylinders to their axles falling down, and by the action of\r\n\"skidding\" the runner, producing so much friction as to cause an\r\nexplosion, receptacles are formed to catch them in their fall. As small\r\npieces of grit, the natural enemy of the powder-maker, might prove\r\ndangerous if mixed with any of the \"charges,\" the axle sockets of nearly\r\nall the wheels are constructed to expand, so as to allow any hard foreign\r\nbody to pass through just in the same manner in which the fine jaws of the\r\nlarger serpents are loosely hinged, to enable them to get over at one gulp\r\nsuch a bulky morsel as a full-grown rabbit.\r\n\r\nAccidents will happen, however, in the best-regulated mills, and provision\r\nis made for rendering an explosion when it occurs as innocuous as\r\npossible. The new incorporating mills are constructed with three sides of\r\nsolid brickwork three feet thick, and the fourth side and roof of\r\ncorrugated iron and glass lightly adjusted. As they are placed in a row\r\ncontiguous to each other, the alternate ones only face the same way, so\r\nthat the line of fire, or the direction the explosion would take through\r\nthe weakest end, would not be likely to involve in destruction the\r\nneighbouring mill. It does occasionally happen, however, that the\r\nprecautions are not sufficient to prevent danger spreading. In the great\r\nexplosion which took place in 1842 a second house was fired at a couple of\r\nhundred yards distance from the spot where the original explosion took\r\nplace. There is now a further security against the houses going one after\r\nanother, like houses of cards. Over each mill a copper tank, containing\r\nabout forty gallons of water, is so suspended that on the lifting of a\r\nlever it instantly discharges its contents and floods the mill. This\r\nshower or douche bath is made self-acting, inasmuch as the explosion\r\nitself pulls the string, the force of the expanding gas lifting up a\r\nhinged shutter which acts like a trigger to let down the water. \"But,\" it\r\nmay be said, \"as the water does not fall until the explosion has taken\r\nplace, this contrivance is very like locking the stable door when the\r\nsteed is stolen!\" And this is the case with respect to the mill where the\r\noriginal mischief took place; but the lever first acted upon discharges\r\nthe shower-bath over the heads of all the others also, and by this means\r\nthe evil is limited to the place where it originated. From the\r\nincorporating mills the kneading powder, or \"mill cake,\" as it is termed,\r\nis taken by another funeral-looking gondola to small expense-magazines,\r\nwhere it is allowed to remain for twelve hours before being taken to the\r\nbreaking-down house. Here the hard lumps of mill cake are ground into fine\r\npowder by the action of fine-toothed rollers made of gun-metal, which\r\nrevolve towards each other and crush the cake which falls between them to\r\ndust. The broken-down mill cake once more travels between pleasant meadows\r\nfringed with willow until it reaches the press house, where the meal is\r\nsubjected to hydraulic pressure between plates of gun-metal, and is\r\nthereby reduced to dense plates about half an inch thick. These plates are\r\nallowed to remain intact for a couple of days, by which time they become\r\nas hard as a piece of fine pottery. Very many advantages are gained by\r\nthis pressure. The density of the powder is increased, which enables it to\r\nbe conveyed without working into fine dust; its keeping qualities are\r\nimproved, as it absorbs less moisture than if it were more porous; and\r\nlastly, a greater volume of inflammable gas is produced from a given bulk.\r\n\r\nThe pressed cake is now transferred to the maw of one of the most\r\nextraordinary machines we have yet witnessed. The granulating house, where\r\nthe important process of dividing the powder into fine grains takes place,\r\nis removed very far away from the other buildings. The danger of the\r\noperation carried on within is implied by the strong traverse fifteen feet\r\nthick at the bottom, which is intended to act as a shield to the workmen\r\nin case of an accident. It was here an explosion took place in 1843, by\r\nwhich eight workmen lost their lives--in what manner no one knows, as all\r\nthe evidence was swept away. To render the recurrence of such lamentable\r\naccidents as rare as possible, the machine is made self-acting. At\r\ncertain times of the day it is supplied with food in the shape of fifteen\r\nhundredweight of \"pressed cake.\" This is stuffed into a large hopper or\r\npouch, and the moment the monster is ready, the men retire beyond the\r\nstrong traverse and allow it slowly to masticate its meal, which it does\r\nwith a deliberation worthy of its ponderosity and strength, emptying its\r\npouch by degrees, and by a triturating process performed by two or three\r\nsets of fine rollers, dividing it into different-sized grains. These\r\ngrains it passes through a series of wire sieves, separating the larger\r\nones fitted for cannon powder from the finer kind required for rifles, and\r\ndepositing them in their appropriate boxes, which, when full, it removes\r\nfrom its own dangerous proximity, and takes up empty ones in their place.\r\nAll the larger undigested pieces it returns again, like a ruminating\r\nanimal, to its masticating process until its supply is exhausted. Then,\r\nand not till then, like Mademoiselle Jack, the famous elephant, it rings a\r\nbell for some fresh \"cake.\" The workmen allow it about five minutes' grace\r\nto thoroughly assimilate the supply already in its maw, when the machine\r\nstops, and they enter with another meal. The floors of all the different\r\nhouses are covered with leather neatly fastened down with copper nails,\r\nand the brush is never out of the hands of the workman: even while you are\r\ntalking to him, he sweeps away in the gravest manner in order to remove\r\nany particles of powder or grit that maybe on the floor; this he does\r\nmechanically, when not a particle of anything is to be seen, just as a\r\nsailor in a crack ship always holystones the deck, clean or dirty, the\r\nmoment he has any spare time.\r\n\r\nThe powder thus separated into grains is still damp and full of dust. To\r\nget rid of this it is taken by water to the dusting-house, where it is\r\nbolted in a reel like so much flour. It has now to be glazed, a very\r\nimportant operation, performed by placing it in large barrels, which\r\nrevolve with their load thirty-two times a minute for three hours\r\ntogether. By the mere friction of the grains against each other and the\r\nsides of the barrel, a fine polish is imparted to the surface of the\r\ngrain, which enables it to withstand the action of the atmosphere much\r\nbetter than when it is left unglazed. It is now stoved for sixteen hours\r\nin a drying-room heated by steam pipes to a heat of 130° Fahrenheit, and\r\nis then finally dusted and proved. There are many methods of proving, but\r\nthe simplest and most efficacious is to fire the powder from the weapon it\r\nis intended to serve. Thus cannon powder is proved by firing a 68-pound\r\nsolid shot with a charge of two ounces of powder--a charge which should\r\ngive a range of from 270 to 300 feet. If the powder passes the test, which\r\nit generally does, it is packed in barrels holding 100 lbs. each, marked\r\nL. G. (Large Grain), and F. G. (Fine Grain), as the case may be, and\r\ncarried to the provisional magazine. When 500 barrels have accumulated\r\nthey are despatched in a barge to the Government magazine at Purfleet,\r\nnear the mouth of the Thames, the Lea forming the connecting link of water\r\nbetween the canals of the works and that river.\r\n\r\nThe produce of this establishment, which had fallen so low as 4,500\r\nbarrels per annum in 1843, is now so increased by improved machinery that\r\n20,000 barrels a year can be manufactured, and of the very best quality.\r\nEven this supply is far below the consumption during a time of war, and\r\ncontractors have, and always will have, to furnish a portion of the\r\nrequired supplies; but it seems that a model mill is useful for the double\r\npurpose of keeping up a due standard of quality,[27] and of keeping down\r\nprice. On the uniform strength of the powder depends the accuracy of\r\nartillery fire: hence the necessity of having some known standard of\r\nquality from which contractors should not be allowed to depart. The\r\nimprovements which have taken place in the manufacture are very marked.\r\nAbout the year 1790, when powder was supplied to Government wholly by\r\ncontract, the regulation weight of charge for a cannon was half the weight\r\nof the ball; it is now less than one-third: therefore two barrels are now\r\nused instead of three, a reduction of bulk which economizes stowage on\r\nboard ship as well as in the field. Formerly powder had a range of 190\r\nfeet only; the range is now increased to 268 feet! This vast improvement\r\nis simply the consequence of the care with which the powder is worked, and\r\nthe attention bestowed on every detail of the mills since their direction\r\nfell into the hands of Colonel Tulloh, Colonel Dickson, and Colonel\r\nAskwith, the present Superintendent.\r\n\r\nThere is a department at the Woolwich Arsenal to which we must now return,\r\nof which the establishments at Enfield and Waltham Abbey may be considered\r\nbut outlying offshoots. Beyond the canal, at the extreme end of the\r\nground, lie the establishments devoted to the more dangerous portions of\r\npyrotechnic manufacture, such as the filling of rockets, of\r\nfriction-tubes, the driving of fuses, &c. These ticklish operations used\r\nto be conducted in ill-built sheds in the laboratory square, where a sad\r\nexplosion took place during the war, and Captain Boxer, determining to\r\nreduce the risk of accidents, transferred the whole of them in 1854 to\r\nthis open space, far away from the neighbourhood of fire. The sixteen\r\nhouses used for fuse-driving and friction-tube-making are isolated from\r\neach other much in the same manner as the incorporating mills at Waltham\r\nAbbey: we need not therefore describe them. The rocket manufactory is also\r\nso carefully arranged that accidents can rarely happen. The method of\r\ndriving the composition into these frightfully destructive implements of\r\nwar was, until lately, not only barbarous but dangerous in the extreme,\r\nbeing forced in by a \"monkey,\" or small pile-driver, worked by eight men.\r\nThe pressure of water now does the work silently, effectually, and safely.\r\nThe rocket is so fixed while it is being filled, that in case of an\r\naccident the discharge will fly through the roof; grit and iron are as\r\ncarefully excluded as in the powder mills; open spaces around the\r\nbuildings are covered with turf and planted with shrubs, and a raised\r\ncauseway of wood keeps the communications between the different magazines\r\nfree from all substances likely to produce friction. The visitor may no\r\nmore enter one of these carefully-guarded buildings with his shoes on than\r\nhe could walk into the mosque of St. Sophia, at Constantinople, similarly\r\nshod. With equal care the process of greasing the bullet end of the\r\nsmall-arm cartridges is carried on in this portion of the Arsenal. For a\r\nlong time no lubricating material could be found that remained unaffected\r\nin all climates--a very important desideratum, considering the manner in\r\nwhich our stores of war are moved about from the depths of arctic waters\r\nto the burning summers of the torrid zone. Captain Boxer, however, in a\r\nhappy moment, thought of the little busy insect that builds a store-house\r\nwarranted to keep in all temperatures, and adopted bees' wax, which, added\r\nto a little fat, makes a compound which answers the purpose perfectly. The\r\ncartridges are dipped about an inch deep into a receptacle of this liquid\r\nkept fluid by the heat of gas. As we watched the process going on, we\r\ncould not avoid reflecting from what insignificant causes great events\r\narise, and that a rebellion which well-nigh snatched India from our grasp\r\nsprung from this very cauldron seething with \"hell-broth thick and slab.\"\r\n\r\nThe different departments of the Royal Arsenal are separated by large open\r\nspaces, in which the rougher materials of war are deposited. The roadways,\r\nlaid with iron trams, which greatly facilitate the transfer of heavy guns,\r\nare lined here and there with pyramids of shot and shell, lackered and\r\nshining in the sun. These missiles are continually circulating along the\r\nshoots from one spot in the Arsenal to another, passing at one time\r\nunderfoot, at another overhead, the action of gravity being pressed into\r\nthe service with other labour-saving contrivances, to remove 13-inch\r\nshells and 98-pounder solid shot, sometimes to very considerable\r\ndistances. Vast as are the stores of these warlike implements, and far as\r\nthe vistas of pyramids stretch (and there are no less than 688,000 in the\r\nArsenal at present), they would speedily be drained by a short return of\r\nwar, in which artillery now plays so prominent a part. At the siege of\r\nSebastopol alone, which scarcely occupied eighteen months, no less than\r\n253,042 shot and shell of all sizes were fired from our batteries, a\r\nnumber which the enemy surpassed, in one attack alone, if we are to\r\nbelieve the evidence afforded by some of the ravines, in which this iron\r\nrain descended so thickly that it paved the ground and prevented the grass\r\nfrom springing up. The French were even more prodigal of these\r\nprojectiles; for, according to the report made to the Emperor, 1,100,000\r\nof them were sent by our allies into the doomed city.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of each department is generally indicated by the class\r\nof war stores to be seen at hand. We may be sure we are near the great-gun\r\nfoundry, for instance, when we see the long files of iron guns of all\r\nsizes and patterns, from the light 32-pounders to the truly formidable\r\n98-pounders of the naval service, flanking the road, compared with which\r\nthe light brass field-pieces that fringe the wall of the building itself\r\nseem the merest toy-guns. Here and there trim grass-plots are seen with a\r\nneat edging of three hundred 13-inch mortars, and at the grand entrance of\r\nthe foundry itself enormous shells, a yard in diameter, prepared for\r\nMallett's mammoth mortar, are planted, as if to show how daring are the\r\nideas of modern war, which proposes to throw such Titanic missiles at the\r\nenemy. Here too may be seen veterans which have seen service--avenues of\r\nwounded guns from the Crimea. These are the picked specimens of the\r\neighty-eight pieces of ordnance either disabled by the enemy or worn out\r\nby their own fire in that ever-memorable siege. One, a 68-pounder, was\r\nshattered by a singular accident; just as it was being discharged a shell\r\nfired by the enemy exploded in its mouth, and destroyed it after it had\r\nfired no less than 2,000 rounds. Another gun, which is split in the\r\nmuzzle, was hit thirteen times. There appears to have been luck in this\r\nmystic number, however, for by the aid of an iron band the mishap was\r\nrepaired, and it went on doing duty until one of its trunnions was knocked\r\noff, and even then, like the gallant Widderington, at Chevy Chase, it\r\nfought upon its stumps; for, on being sunk into the ground, and fired at a\r\nhigh elevation, it was kept at work up to the end of the siege. Some of\r\nthese guns are pitted with cannon-shot even as far back as the breech, and\r\none or two are hit in their very stern-most parts. These wounds are the\r\nresult of ricochet firing, a kind of practice which enables a shot to drop\r\nin the most unexpected places.\r\n\r\nIn the mounting yard, as it is termed, which lies between the gun and\r\ncarriage factories, the field-pieces are mounted upon their carriages and\r\nfitted up for service previous to their removal to the depôt of artillery\r\nnear the Common. Since the war the captured cannon from Sebastopol have\r\nbeen stored here preparatory to their being either broken up or\r\ndistributed as trophies to the various towns of the United Kingdom. Of\r\nthese guns 1079 are of iron and 94 of brass. They are of admirable metal,\r\nand would have proved very serviceable, except that unfortunately their\r\nbore does not suit any of our shot. Gun-carriages rent by the bursting of\r\nguns, or so unscientifically constructed as inevitably to destroy\r\nthemselves, like the iron carriages taken from the enemy at Kertch, are\r\nkept as lessons for the Captain Instructor to dwell upon, when he takes\r\nround his bevy of young artillery cadets. This official performs the\r\nessential duty of giving the future artillery officer a clear insight into\r\nthe method of constructing and repairing all the more essential engines\r\nand tools he will have to work with--such as guns, gun-carriages, &c., and\r\nof obtaining a general notion of the relative strength of metals, and of\r\nthe value of the various materials out of which the munitions of war are\r\nformed. The vast workshops of Woolwich afford an admirable field for the\r\nacquisition of this kind of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of the Arsenal to the chief Military Academy in the\r\nkingdom gives these embryo artillery officers an opportunity of witnessing\r\nthe experiments which are constantly going on in the Marshes, either for\r\nthe purpose of testing new guns, or of practically examining the\r\ncapabilities of new inventions. The extraordinary energy with which\r\nprojectors of all kinds (clergymen among the number) devoted themselves to\r\nthe task of inventing new implements of destruction during the Russian war\r\nentirely belied that lamb-like spirit attributed by Mr. Cobden to his\r\nfellow-countrymen. No less than 1976 new projects were submitted to the\r\nSelect Committee of Ordnance with respect to artillery alone. Of this\r\nnumber a large proportion were of the most imbecile kind--such as\r\nproposals to fill shells with Cayenne pepper, chloroform, and cacodyle,\r\nthe latter a most virulent material which has the property of poisoning\r\nthe air around it. The asphyxiating ball of the French was the true parent\r\nof the whole brood. Only forty-three of the propositions were favourably\r\nreported on, and of this number only thirty have been adopted into the\r\nservice. First and foremost among these is the plan of filling shells with\r\nliquid iron. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the destructive effect\r\nof this new application of an old material. At the second shot fired in\r\nthe Marshes against a perfectly new butt which cost 200_l._, it set it on\r\nfire and entirely destroyed it. The engines of the Arsenal and the old\r\nexpedient of heaping earth against the burning wood were of no avail, the\r\nmolten iron having penetrated in all directions deep into the timber. It\r\nis hard to believe that any ship will be able to resist the destructive\r\neffect of these shells, or that masses of men will be found courageous\r\nenough to withstand their devastating effects; for immediately the\r\npercussion shell comes in contact with any object, it explodes and throws\r\nthe molten metal in all directions--splashing and striking objects that\r\nare completely out of the way of the contents of ordinary shells, and\r\nproving far more deadly both to animate and inanimate substances than the\r\nfamous Greek fire of old. This very invention was brought to the notice of\r\nthe authorities as early as 1803 by a workman in a London iron-foundry;\r\nbut the suggestion was so contrary to all the current notions of the time,\r\nthat it was rejected, and not heard of again until a new war brought into\r\nplay more advanced ideas.\r\n\r\nThe new guns that were brought forward were innumerable, and many of them,\r\nsuch as the Mersey steel gun, and the great mortar, are still under trial.\r\nIf this mortar, which is built up of a series of rings 9 inches broad and\r\n3-1/2 inches thick, laid over one another, and fitting tightly, so as to\r\nform a barrel, should ultimately prove capable of resisting the full\r\ncharge of 70 lbs. weight of powder, it will be the most destructive\r\nimplement yet invented for the purpose of crushing fortified places. In\r\nsome of the trials which have taken place in the Marshes, it threw its\r\n36-inch shell, weighing 26 cwt., upwards of two miles; and when the\r\nmissile fell, it buried itself in the ground to so considerable a depth,\r\nthat after digging down 12 feet, and probing for 15 feet more, it still\r\nremained undiscovered. The artillerymen say jestingly that it has dropped\r\ndown to Australia, No casemate at present in existence could withstand the\r\ncrushing weight of its fall, and its bursting charge of 200 lbs. of\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nAfter contemplating this vast establishment for the manufacture of arms,\r\nwith its sixty steam-engines, which through the agency of upwards of three\r\nmiles of running shafting, give motion to upwards of a thousand machines,\r\nwe must not omit to mention the human labour which directs this enormous\r\nmanufacturing power. During the height of the Crimean war, upwards of\r\n10,000 men and boys were employed in the Arsenal, an army of workers\r\nengaged upon the production of the materials of destruction equal to the\r\nentire force encamped at Aldershot, and double the number of men that\r\nbesieged and took Delhi. When such masses of men as this have to be dealt\r\nwith daily, it is obvious how necessary it must be to possess an organized\r\nsystem by which the loss of what might otherwise be considered mere\r\nfractions of time is noted. Let us suppose, for instance, that every man\r\nand boy in the Arsenal lost only five minutes per day, and it would amount\r\nin the aggregate to the loss of the labour of one man for twelve weeks to\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThe next problem to be solved is how to pay 10,000 men in any reasonable\r\ntime. It would be clearly impossible to calculate each man's wages at the\r\ntime of payment, even if a little army of clerks were employed. It is\r\ntherefore done beforehand by a staff of men employed for this purpose. The\r\namount due to each person having been ascertained, the money is laid out\r\non boards divided into partitions numbered consecutively. A corresponding\r\nnumber for each man, with the amount to be given to him, is distributed\r\npreviously to the payment taking place, on what is termed a \"pay ticket.\"\r\nOn pay-day the artisans take their places in single file, arranging\r\nthemselves according to their numbers, and, passing in front of the\r\npay-boards, receive their wages, and surrender their tickets, which are\r\nreceipts for the money. No money is exchanged if not brought back before\r\nthe man reaches a certain point, and in this space there are persons\r\nstationed to watch that no exchange is made of bad money for good. To\r\nsearch every man as he left would be impossible, yet it is highly\r\nnecessary to have some means of checking petty depredations of metal, &c.\r\nFormerly peculations of this kind were constant, and the aggregate loss\r\nmust have been immense. When it was first determined to put a stop to it,\r\nthe men were told only a few minutes before leaving work that they would\r\nbe searched as they went out. The effect of this announcement was that the\r\nwhole Arsenal was strewed with small pilfered articles thrown hastily\r\naway. Now a couple of policemen at the gate touch indiscriminately a\r\ncertain per-centage of the men as they are going, and these have to pass\r\nthrough a side lodge to be searched. As no man can tell whether or no he\r\nwill be touched, the whole mass is kept honest. The mere lodging of such a\r\nbody of men was at first a difficulty, even in so large a town as\r\nWoolwich: the demand, however, soon produced supply, and the means taken\r\nto insure the fall of Sebastopol caused the rise of a new town of at least\r\ntwo thousand houses in the immediate neighbourhood of the Arsenal.\r\n\r\nComplete as we have shown the organization of the Arsenal to be, both as\r\nregards its mechanical resources and its staff, it is generally understood\r\nthat the Government do not intend to depend upon it wholly for the supply\r\nof the munitions of war. In the case of small-arms, its powers, as we have\r\nseen, are wholly inadequate to the task. In those branches, however, where\r\nthe manufacturing power is ample, they will not attempt to push it to the\r\npoint of excluding the private manufacturer from a share in the business.\r\nThis is, we think, a wise decision; for, however excellent may be the\r\npresent arrangements now everything is new and the broom is fresh, it\r\ncannot be denied that the tendency of this and all other Government\r\nestablishments is to go to sleep, since they neither possess the stimulus\r\nof private gain to teach them economy, nor that unity of direction which\r\ngives such vigour to private enterprises. The principle of competition\r\nought therefore to be kept up, and we should run the private manufacturer\r\nagainst the public one in order to keep down price, and pit the Royal\r\nFactory against the trade in order to keep up quality. Another great gain\r\nwill accrue from the determination of the Government, which is, that the\r\nprivate manufacturers will not lose the art of making certain stores of\r\nwar--an art which can not be learned in a day. It would be unwise for the\r\nauthorities to put all their eggs into one basket, and this they would\r\nmost assuredly do by entirely depending upon their own powers of\r\nproduction, and in disassociating themselves from the great and fertile\r\nmanufacturing power of England, which generally knows so well how to\r\neconomize and progress.\r\n\r\nIf the Government have shown judgment and foresight upon this point, we\r\ncannot say as much for their inexcusable neglect to provide for the\r\nsecurity of this enormous establishment, which contains within its walls\r\nnot only the principal depôt of warlike stores in the island, but also the\r\nmeans of producing them. We do not believe that our neighbours are going\r\nto sail up the Thames quite as easily as the Dutch did, or that any\r\nforeign army marching from Dover could destroy the Arsenal on its way to\r\nthe capital without our having ample notice of their approach.\r\nNevertheless we cannot think that the sole Arsenal of England, placed as\r\nit is in a very accessible part of the island, should be left entirely\r\nwithout the means of defence. The place itself could not be fortified, as\r\nit is commanded by the heights of Shooter's Hill; but the neighbourhood is\r\nadmirably adapted for the purpose. In the opinion of military engineers,\r\nit would not be necessary even to erect the requisite works until the\r\nmoment their services were required. Half a dozen earth batteries, mounted\r\nwith heavy guns, would command all the land approaches; and a few flats,\r\nposted so as to sweep the reaches of the river, would effectually prevent\r\nthe approach of any hostile force by water. The scheme of these batteries\r\nshould, however, be settled beforehand in all their details, so that in\r\nthe moment of danger they could be completed almost in the presence of the\r\nenemy, in case an invader should give the Channel Fleet the slip some\r\nmisty morning, and succeed in making good his footing upon our shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIPWRECKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no nobler or more national sight in our island than to behold the\r\nprocession of stately vessels as they pass in panoramic pride along our\r\nshores, or navigate the great arterial streams of commerce,--to witness\r\nthe deeply-laden Indiaman warped out of the docks, or to see the emigrant\r\nship speeding with bellying sails down Blackwall Reach, watched by many\r\nweeping eyes, and the depository of many aching hearts. It would, however,\r\nspoil the enjoyment of the least-interested spectator if the veil could be\r\nlifted from the dark future; if that gallant Indiaman could be shown him\r\nbroadside on among the breakers; or that stately vessel, with bulwarks\r\nfringed with tearful groups looking so sadly to the receding shore, were\r\npictured by him foundering in mid ocean--gone to swell the numbers of the\r\ndismal fleet that yearly sails and is never heard of more. Sadder still\r\nwould be his reflections if another passing ship could be shown him,\r\ndestined perhaps to circle the globe in safety, and when within sight of\r\nthe white cliffs of Albion, full of joyful hearts, suddenly, in the dark\r\nand stormy night, fated to be dashed to atoms, like the _Reliance_ and\r\n_Conqueror_, on a foreign strand. If such dramatic contrasts as these\r\ncould be witnessed, we should without doubt strain every nerve to prevent\r\ntheir recurrence. As it is, the sad tale of disasters at sea comes to us\r\nweakened by the lapse of time and the distance of the scene of the\r\ncatastrophe: instead of having the harrowing sight before our eyes, we\r\nhave only statistics which raise no emotion, and even rarely arrest\r\nattention. In connection with these annual returns there is published a\r\nfearful-looking map termed a wreck chart, in which the shores of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland are shown fringed with dots,--the sites of wrecks,\r\ncollisions, and other disasters. From this we perceive how all the\r\ndangerous headlands and sandbanks on the coast are strewn with--\r\n\r\n  \"A thousand fearful wrecks,\r\n  A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;\r\n  Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\r\n  Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels--\r\n  All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, these dismal finger-posts to marine disasters are\r\ngenerally found grouped around the sites of lighthouses. If we analyze the\r\nchart for the year 1857, we perceive at a glance the relative dangers of\r\nthe three seaboards of triangular England, and that a fatal pre-eminence\r\nis given to the East coast. Out of a total of 1,143 wrecks and casualties\r\nwhich took place in this year, no less than 600, or more than one-half,\r\noccurred between Dungeness and Pentland Frith. Along this perilous sea,\r\nbeset with sands, shoals, and rocky headlands, no less than 150,000\r\nvessels pass annually, the greater part ill-constructed, deeply-laden\r\ncolliers, such as we see in the Pool, and wonder how they manage to\r\nsurvive a gale of wind. The South coast, extending from Dungeness to the\r\nLand's End, is comparatively safe, only 84 wrecks having taken place in\r\n1847; whilst from the Land's End to Greenock, where the influence of the\r\nAtlantic gales is most sensibly felt, the numbers rise again to 286, and\r\nthe Irish coast contributes a total of 173.\r\n\r\nIf we take a more extended view of these disastrous occurrences by opening\r\nthe wreck chart attached to the evidence of the select committee on\r\nharbours of refuge, given in 1857, containing the casualties of five years\r\nfrom 1852 to 1856, both inclusive, we shall be better able to analyze\r\ntheir causes. Within this period no less than 5,128 wrecks and collisions\r\ntook place, being an average of 1,025 a year. According to the evidence of\r\nCaptain Washington, R.N., the scientific and indefatigable hydrographer of\r\nthe Admiralty, these casualties consisted of\r\n\r\n                                              Vessels.\r\n  Total losses by stranding or otherwise       1,940\r\n     \"      \"     collisions                     244\r\n  Serious damage having to discharge           2,401\r\n  Collisions with serious damage                 543\r\n                                               -----\r\n                                               5,128\r\n\r\nThe total losses from all causes, therefore, amounted to 2,184 vessels, or\r\nto an average of nearly 437 in each year. The destruction of life\r\nconsequent upon these casualties was 4,148 persons, or, upon the average\r\nof five years, nearly 830 in each year. In 1854 no fewer than 1,549\r\npersons were drowned.\r\n\r\nHow such a calamity should have been so long tolerated in a civilized\r\ncountry, without any proper attempt at a remedy, it is not easy to\r\ncomprehend. Still more incomprehensible, in a trading country, is the\r\napparent disregard of the pecuniary sacrifice. It appears in evidence that\r\nthe loss by total wrecks is estimated at 1,000,000_l._ a year at least,\r\nand by other casualties at 500,000_l._, making together 1,500,000_l._ as\r\nthe annual loss to the country from the accidents on our own coasts--a sum\r\nwhich in two years would be ample to build all the harbours of refuge that\r\nare needed around our shores.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards a remedy for this state of things is to inquire\r\ninto the causes of shipwreck. There can be little hesitation in naming\r\nMarine Insurance as the chief destroyer. Unseaworthiness and overloading\r\nof vessels; their being ill found in anchors, cables, sails, and rigging;\r\ndefects of compasses, want of good charts, incompetency of masters, may\r\nall be attributed to this source. If the shipowners were not guaranteed\r\nfrom loss, they would take care that their vessels were seaworthy,\r\ncommanded by qualified persons, and furnished with every necessary store.\r\nThe terms of the insurance, moreover, offer a direct premium to create in\r\nall cases of casualty a \"total loss.\" For instance, a ship strikes the\r\nground and becomes damaged, but, under able management, might be got off\r\nand repaired. In this case, however, the assured has to bear one third\r\npart of the loss; whereas, if the loss is total, he gets the whole of his\r\ninsurance. Under these circumstances, even when there is no deliberate\r\ndesire to perpetrate a wrong, the captain will leave the ship to her fate\r\ninstead of using his energies to preserve her to the detriment of his\r\nemployer. It is the opinion of many that if the insurers were to agree to\r\npay the whole insurance, whether the damaged vessel were got off or not,\r\nthat we should see a marked diminution in the list of total losses at\r\nsea, for the natural inclination of the captain to save his ship would\r\nthen no longer be counterbalanced by his desire to save the pocket of the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of casualties, however, which are the product of villany,\r\nagainst which we see no protection excepting in the vigilance of the\r\ninsurers: we refer to those cases of wilful casting away, which are not\r\nunknown even in this country, as the late trial of a captain, at the Old\r\nBailey, will testify; but which are most frequent on the Florida Reef. It\r\nis notorious that our American friends are in the habit of sailing ships\r\ninto these waters, with the deliberate intention of steering them to\r\ndestruction. So well is this known, that those on shore can predict, with\r\ntolerable accuracy, from the handling of the vessel, whether she is about\r\nto be sunk or not. When it is not the skipper's interest to lose his\r\ncraft, he will allow the wreckers, who swarm as plentifully as sharks in\r\nthose waters, to act as pilots, and to put the ship in dangerous positions\r\nfor the purpose of making a claim for salvage, which the swindling captain\r\nshares with them. In the years 1854, 1855, and 1856, 189 ships were either\r\nlost or put into Key West. The salvage upon the latter class amounted to\r\n298,400·05 dollars, a large portion of which was, without doubt, obtained\r\nby fraud. It is far from our purpose to insinuate that the Americans are\r\nworse than their neighbours in this particular; had the English the same\r\nopportunity, there would always be found persons to enter upon similar\r\npractices. The memory of wrecking is not yet extinct in Cornwall, and only\r\na few years since it was notorious that the pilots of the Downs were in\r\nthe habit of recommending the cables of the vessels in their charge to be\r\nslipped in very moderate gales of wind, because these worthies had a good\r\nunderstanding with the chain and anchor makers of the neighbouring ports\r\nwho would have to supply fresh tackle.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, that the same cause which prompts these villanies,\r\noperates in some measure as an antidote. The underwriters at Lloyd's and\r\nthe different marine insurance offices, act in a certain degree as the\r\npolice force of the seas. Their agents are as plentiful and ubiquitous as\r\nflies, and there is no port of the old or new world without one or more\r\nof them. Through the medium of these marine sentries, whose eyes are\r\nalways upon the ocean, disasters at sea are speedily made known to the\r\nunderwriters, and in those cases where the telegraph is at hand, a ship\r\nhas scarcely broken up or come ashore, before hundreds are reading the\r\naccount of the disaster upon the \"Board\" at Lloyd's. With this spider-like\r\nweb of intelligence spreading from port to port and from ocean to ocean,\r\nthe chances of wreckers either on shipboard or on land must certainly\r\ndiminish. The acuteness of the underwriters, sharpened by self-interest,\r\nis brought to bear upon the distant point, and all the resources of a\r\npowerful corporation are put in force to detect fraud when suspected, and\r\nto punish it when confirmed. A singular instance of the vigour and\r\ningenuity displayed by their agents in pursuing the marine robber was\r\nafforded by the case of the American ship _W. T. Sayward_. This vessel was\r\nreported by her skipper to have been lost off Loo Choo, on her voyage from\r\nSan Francisco to Shanghai, and the sum claimed of the insurers in this\r\ncountry was £50,000, the value of the cargo, which was reported to have\r\ncomprised, among other things, 50,000 Carolus dollars. It struck the\r\ngentleman engaged to settle the claim that it was very unusual to ship\r\nsuch a quantity of this \"Pillar\" dollar, and on inquiring of the\r\nmoney-changers, he learnt that there was not a tithe of that number at\r\npresent in existence out of China. This discovery at once aroused\r\nsuspicion, and agents were sent to the spot where the ship had been lost,\r\nwhen it was found that the sailors, suspecting some roguery, returned to\r\nthe wreck after the captain had departed, dived into her hold and\r\ndiscovered that she had been wilfully scuttled. They lighted, by happy\r\nchance, upon some of the boxes in which the \"dollars\" were shipped, and\r\nthey were found to contain only iron nails and leaden bullets. The nails\r\nwere selected for the sake of the chink. The assured, having heard of what\r\nhad occurred, never ventured to repeat their claim.\r\n\r\nIn a more recent case, that of the brig _Cornelia_, a regular trader\r\nbetween the coast of Mexico and San Francisco, which was wilfully\r\nscuttled off San Quentin on the 27th of March last, it was reported that\r\nshe had 48,000 Mexican dollars on board, 19,000 shipped at Mazatlan by an\r\nEnglish house, and 29,000 by other persons. On the captain's own\r\nconfession the 19,000 dollars were removed by him just before he scuttled\r\nthe vessel, and hidden in the sand at Cape San Lucas, on the coast of\r\nLower California; the remaining sum of 29,000 dollars he admitted had\r\nnever been shipped at all, bills of lading having been fabricated, and a\r\nmythical consignee improvised for the occasion. Had not the agent been on\r\nthe alert, this knave would have robbed the underwriters at one swoop of\r\n48,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nFrom the chief moral, or rather immoral, cause of shipwreck and loss at\r\nsea, we pass to a consideration of the physical agents which act directly\r\nin producing these disasters. Of these there are so many, and of such\r\nvarious natures, that it is difficult to group them. Currents of the\r\nocean, fog, lightning, icebergs, sandbanks, water-logged ships, defective\r\ncompasses, and imperfect charts, are all dangers which beset the path of\r\nnavigators, and especially of such as have to run the gauntlet in\r\nill-found ships. The effect of currents in taking the sailor out of his\r\nreckoning is an old, and formerly perhaps a frequent, cause of shipwreck.\r\nThis source of danger is now much obviated by the more intimate knowledge\r\nwe are acquiring every day of the general laws which produce the currents.\r\nOne of the most effectual as well as simple methods of detecting surface\r\ncurrents is that known to seamen as the bottle experiment. This has been\r\npractised since 1808, but more especially of late years, and has been\r\ndeemed of sufficient importance by the Admiralty to justify an order by\r\nwhich all Her Majesty's ships are enjoined to throw bottles overboard\r\ncontaining a paper, on which is noted the position of the ship and the\r\ntime the frail messenger was sent forth on its voyage. The bottle,\r\ncarefully sealed up, traverses the ocean wherever the winds and\r\nsurface-drift may carry it, and, after a passage of longer or shorter\r\nduration, is perhaps safely washed by the tide upon some beach. Without\r\ndoubt many are smashed upon the rocks, others again are sunk by weeds\r\ngrowing to them, some are destroyed by the attacks of birds or the jaws of\r\nhungry sharks, or if by chance they avoid all these dangers, they may be\r\nconsigned to oblivion upon an uninhabited shore. It is estimated, however,\r\nthat at least one-tenth are recovered. A collection of upwards of 200 has\r\nbeen made at the Admiralty, and are laid down in a chart called the\r\nCurrent Bottle Chart.\r\n\r\nA single glance at this chart displays the principal well-known currents\r\nof the Atlantic ocean. The general tendency of the bottles to go to the\r\neastward in the northern parts of this sea, and to the westward in lower\r\nlatitudes, is at once apparent. It is equally evident that to the\r\nsouthward of the parallel of 40° N. on the eastern side of the Atlantic\r\nthe bottles drift to the southward, while those again in the vicinity of\r\nthe Canaries and Cape Verd Islands take a westerly direction. Those\r\nfurther south, lose themselves among the West-India Islands, and some\r\npenetrating further are found on the coast of Mexico, between Galveston\r\nand Tanessied. A few manifest the effects of the counter-current of the\r\ncelebrated Gulf-stream, while others again, on the western side of the\r\nAtlantic, from about 40° N., are set to the eastward. Indeed, there seems\r\nto be a determination of all to the northward of the parallel of 40°, or\r\nthat of Philadelphia on the American seaboard, to make their way to the\r\neastward--some to the coast of France, in the Bay of Biscay, others to the\r\nwestern shores of Great Britain and Ireland, and others again to the\r\nshores of Norway.\r\n\r\nWe thus recognize distinctly, first the Portugal current, setting\r\nsouthward; then the equatorial current, influenced by the trade winds;\r\nthen the extraordinary effects of the waters of the Gulf-stream flowing\r\nnorthward along the American coast, over the banks of Newfoundland--one\r\nportion following its north-east course and penetrating to Norway, and\r\nanother continuing easterly into the Bay of Biscay. But let us\r\nparticularize a few of the remarkable journeys made by these glass\r\nvoyagers over the deep. The _Prima Donna_ was thrown over off Cape Coast\r\nCastle, on the west coast of Africa, and after a voyage of somewhere\r\nwithin two years was found on the coast of Cornwall. Now, to have arrived\r\nthere, it must have been carried eastward by the well-known Guinea\r\ncurrent, and reaching the Bights of Biafra and Benin it would meet the\r\nAfrican current then coming from the southward, with which it would\r\nrecross the equator and travel with the equatorial current through the\r\nWest-India Islands, and getting into the Gulf-stream, would be carried by\r\nthis to the north-east, and thus would be landed on the Cornish coast,\r\nafter making a detour of many thousand miles. But curious as this is, it\r\nis not the only instance, for we find that the _Lady Montagu_, setting out\r\nin nearly 8° S. lat., about midway between Brazil and Africa, a position\r\nwhich would fairly place it in the equatorial current, made the same\r\nvoyage, but landed at Guernsey, having accomplished the course in 295\r\ndays, or between the 15th October, 1820, and the 6th of August, 1821.\r\nConfining ourselves now to the area included between 30° N. lat. and the\r\nequator, the general effect of the heat of the Gulf of Mexico in forcing\r\nthe waters thither is plainly indicated by the direction which the bottles\r\nhave followed that are included within those limits. Those thrown\r\noverboard in the Mexican Gulf, to the north of Cape Catoche of Yucatan,\r\nare hurried away with it and cast on the American shore, near St.\r\nAugustine and Charleston. Other instances show the effects of the\r\ncounter-current of the Gulf-stream on its eastern or ocean side, in\r\ndriving bottles to the south-east, a current that must have affected the\r\nships of Columbus in his first discovery, and which, upon his return\r\nnorthward among the islands, without doubt met and opposed his progress.\r\n\r\nA curious example of the effects of the wind on the surface-waters is\r\nshown by a bottle thrown over from H.M.S. _Vulcan_ in the midst of the\r\nGulf-stream, about 130 miles southward of Cape Hatteras. The ship was on\r\nher way to Bermuda, where she arrived, and the bottle, instead of being\r\ncarried by the current to the north-east like others, actually went after\r\nher and arrived at Bermuda also. But we find noted on the paper that a\r\nstrong northerly wind was blowing when the bottle started. This must have\r\nbeen sufficient to have checked its progress to the north-east, but\r\nallowed it to approach the eastern border of the Gulf-stream, whence it\r\nwould drift into the eddy or counter-current, and thus become thrown on\r\nBermuda. Again, between the Gulf-stream and the American coast bottles\r\nhave found their way to that shore, while those to the northward of the\r\nparallel of 40° have invariably gone eastward; and many thrown over near\r\nthe meridian of 20° have drifted into the Bay of Biscay, and been cast on\r\nthe French coast.\r\n\r\nAmong the numbers of bottles which have travelled westward with the\r\nequatorial and tropical current two are remarkable, as being thrown\r\noverboard about 700 miles from each other and yet arriving at nearly the\r\nsame destination. They were thrown from sister-ships when on their errand\r\nof carrying relief, by way of Behring Strait, to Franklin and his devoted\r\ncrew. The first was dropped from the _Investigator_, Sir R. Maclure, in\r\nlat. 12°, long. 26°, the 27th of February, 1850, and was found on the 27th\r\nAugust following on Ambergris Cay, on the Yucatan coast; the second was\r\nsent afloat on the 3rd March, 1850, by Captain Collinson, in the\r\n_Enterprise_, in lat. 1° N., long. 26° W., and drifted to the coast inside\r\nof that cay, about 30 miles to the northward of it. That the two bottles\r\nshould take their western course was to be expected; but that they should\r\nhave gone to resting-places so near each other is singular, considering\r\nthat their points of starting were so far asunder.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf-stream, the limits of which are so clearly intimated by these\r\nlittle messengers, is but a sample of a grand system of currents which are\r\nproduced by the unequal temperature of the different zones. These currents\r\nof hot and cold water are accompanied by atmospheric changes equally\r\nextraordinary; and, taken together, they largely affect the course of the\r\nnavigator from the old to the new world, and, not unfrequently, are the\r\ncause of the most fearful shipwrecks.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Maury, in his Physical Geography of the Sea, has boldly likened\r\nthe causes at work to produce the celebrated Gulf-stream to the mechanical\r\narrangements by which apartments are heated. The furnace is the torrid\r\nzone, the Mexican Gulf and the Caribbean Sea are the caldrons, and the\r\nGulf-stream is the conducting-pipe by which the warm water and the air\r\nabove it, are dispersed to the banks of Newfoundland and to the\r\nnorth-western shores of the old world.[28] By this beneficent process the\r\ncold of our northern latitudes is greatly ameliorated. The waters sent\r\nnorth and north-east are edged by return currents, the one finding its way\r\nclose to the banks of Newfoundland and along the seaboard of the States,\r\nand the other returning by the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, and the west\r\ncoast of Africa, until about the latitude of the Cape de Verdes it crosses\r\nwestward again to fill up the void caused by the waters issuing from the\r\nGulf of Florida. Thus the grand circuit is for ever maintained, not\r\nalways, however, exactly in the same form, but varying according to the\r\nseason. In the winter, the cold current coming S.S.W. along the Atlantic\r\ncoast of North America is greatly augmented, and pushes the Gulf-stream\r\nfurther to the south-east. With the return of summer this stream, in its\r\nturn, thrusts aside the waters coming from the Polar Ocean. Between these\r\ntwo periods the trough of the Gulf-stream, to use Lieutenant Maury's\r\nforcible expression, \"wavers about in the ocean like a pennon in the\r\nbreeze.\" The temperature of the Gulf-stream, even in the winter, is at the\r\nsummer level as it runs between two walls of nearly ice-cold water. Sir\r\nPhilip Brooke found the air on either side of it at the freezing point, at\r\nthe same time that that of the stream was at 80°. This difference in the\r\ntemperature of air and water is probably the cause of those terrible\r\nhurricanes that occur in the Atlantic and among the West-Indian Islands,\r\nand which make it the most dangerous navigation, during the winter, in the\r\nworld. The average of wrecks on the Atlantic seaboard of the United States\r\nduring these rigorous months is not less than three a day. Sailors term\r\nthe Gulf-stream \"The weather-breeder;\" and well they may, considering its\r\nfrightful effect in producing commotion in sea and air. In Franklin's time\r\nit was no uncommon thing for vessels bound in winter for the Capes of\r\nDelaware to be blown off land, and forced to go to the West Indies, and\r\nthere wait for the return of spring before they could attempt to make for\r\nthis point. The snow-storms and the furious gales which greet the ship as\r\nshe leaves the warm waters of the Gulf and nears the shores of North\r\nAmerica, are quite dramatic in their effect. One day she is sailing\r\nthrough tepid water, and enjoying a summer atmosphere, the next, perhaps,\r\ndriving before a snow-storm, her rigging a mass of icicles, and her crew\r\nfrozen by the piercing blast. The Gulf-stream is answerable for another\r\nphenomenon--the fogs which invariably shroud the Banks of Newfoundland,\r\nand which render the approach to the North-American coast in winter so\r\nparticularly dangerous. The hot water of the Gulf-stream gives up its\r\nvapour to the cold air, and hangs about the coasts an impenetrable\r\ncurtain, which baffles the navigator's skill, renders useless his\r\nchronometer, and but too often sends his bark to destruction upon the\r\nhidden shore.\r\n\r\nAnother danger of the stormy Atlantic arises from the flow southward, in\r\nthe spring and summer months, of icebergs. These stupendous masses have\r\ntheir breeding-place in Davis's Strait, from which they issue in\r\nmagnificent procession directly the current increases in a southerly\r\ndirection. Polar navigators have been surprised to find these huge\r\nmonsters moving against the wind, apparently by some inherent force, and\r\ncrashing through vast fields of ice, as if impatient to escape from the\r\nsilence and desolation of the Polar seas. The explanation of this singular\r\noccurrence is, that powerful under-currents are acting upon the submerged\r\nportions, which, in all cases, vastly preponderate over the glittering\r\nprecipices of crystal that appear above the water-line. As the icebergs\r\nadvance into the open waters of the Atlantic, they at last come to the\r\nedge of the Gulf-stream, where, in \"the great bend,\" about latitude 43°,\r\nthey harbour in dangerous numbers, and without doubt send many a noble\r\nship headlong to the bottom. In all probability the ill-fated _President_\r\nwas thus destroyed, and some towering iceberg, that has long since bowed\r\nits glittering peaks to the solvent action of the warm water of the\r\nGulf-stream, was, perhaps, the only witness of the calamity which placed\r\nthe noble _Pacific_ among the list of ships that have sailed forth into\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nIf the northern latitudes of the Atlantic have their dangers of ice, the\r\nsouthern latitude, especially the Caribbean Sea, in common with all\r\nintertropical oceans, have their dangers of fire. The hurricanes of those\r\nlatitudes are generally accompanied by visitations of fearful\r\nthunder-storms, in which many a good ship is enveloped and destroyed. In\r\nthe midst of a summer sea a clipper ship may be suddenly assailed by one\r\nof those tremendous conflicts of the elements, of the approach of which\r\nthe silver finger of the barometer, unless carefully watched, has scarcely\r\nhad time to give warning. However prepared by good seamanship and an\r\nactive crew, there she must lie on the vexed ocean, her tall masts so many\r\nsuction-tubes to draw down upon her the destructive fire from heaven. In\r\nhis Report to the Admiralty, laid before Parliament in 1854, entitled\r\n\"Shipwrecks by Lightning,\" Sir William Snow Harris--whose exertions to\r\nfind a remedy for this evil are above all praise--states that in six\r\nyears, between 1809 and 1815, forty sail of the line, twenty frigates, and\r\nten sloops were so crippled by being struck as in many cases to be placed\r\nfor a time _hors de combat_. In fifty years there were 280 instances of\r\nserious damage to ships in the British navy. Of these the _Thisbey_\r\nfrigate, off Scilly, in January, 1786, affords a melancholy example. The\r\nlog represents her \"decks swept by lightning, people struck down in all\r\ndirections, the sails and gear aloft in one great blaze, and the ship left\r\na complete wreck.\" In the merchant service the list of disasters is\r\nfearful. Since the year 1820 thirty-three ships, varying from 300 to 1,000\r\ntons, have been totally destroyed by lightning, and forty-five greatly\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\n\"A great peculiarity,\" says Sir William Snow Harris, \"may be observed in\r\ncases of ships set on fire by lightning, viz. a rapid spreading of the\r\nfire in every part of the vessel, as if the electric agency had so\r\npermeated the mass as to render the extinction of the fire by artificial\r\nmeans impossible.\" Take, for instance, the burning of the _Sir Walter\r\nScott_ in June, 1855. This fine passenger ship, of 650 tons, was struck\r\nin the Bay of Biscay: the lightning shivered the foremast, completely\r\nraked the vessel, and instantly set fire to the cargo. The passengers and\r\ncrew had scarcely time to jump from their beds and put on their clothes,\r\nand leap into the boats, when the masts went over the sides, the flames\r\nshot up into the air, and the ship went down like a stone. Such\r\nextraordinary catastrophes as these seem to set forth in unmistakable\r\nterms the feebleness of man in the presence of the tremendous powers of\r\nnature. In reality, they are only forcible instances to call upon him to\r\nuse the means for dominating the peril. Of all the dangers that beset the\r\nmariner at sea, danger by lightning is the only one that he can thoroughly\r\nguard against. To Sir William Snow Harris we owe the perfecting of the\r\nlightning-conductor for marine purposes, and the power of braving\r\nunscathed the direst electric storms. The permanent conductor adopted in\r\nthe navy in 1842 is arranged so as to extend along the masts, from the\r\ntruck to the keelson, and so out to sea. In the hull various branches\r\nramify, and admit of a free dispersion of the electric fluid in all\r\ndirections. Thus armed, the ship is impregnable to all the forked\r\nlightnings that may dart about her. Since the system of fitting men of war\r\nwith this apparatus has been adopted, no vessel of the Royal Navy has been\r\ninjured. The log of the frigate _Shannon_, commanded by the late gallant\r\nSir W. Peel on his voyage out to China, affords a striking example of the\r\nmanner in which the fury of such electric storms as are only to be met\r\nwith in the Indian Ocean, was baffled by a contrivance which may truly be\r\ncalled, in the words of Dibdin--\r\n\r\n      \"The sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,\r\n      And takes care of the life of poor Jack.\"\r\n\r\n    \"When the ship was about 90 miles south of Java she became enveloped\r\n    in a terrific thunderstorm, and at 5 p.m. an immense ball of fire\r\n    covered the maintopgallant-mast: at 5·15 the ship was struck a second\r\n    time on the mainmast by apparently an immense mass of lightning; at\r\n    half-past 5 another very heavy discharge fell upon the mainmast, and\r\n    from this time until 6 p.m. the ship was completely enveloped in sharp\r\n    forked lightning. On the next day her masts and rigging were carefully\r\n    overhauled, but, thanks to Sir Snow Harris's system of permanent\r\n    lightning-conductors, no injury whatever to ship or rigging was\r\n    discovered.\"\r\n\r\nIf we compare this remarkable case with that of His Majesty's frigate\r\n_Lowestoffe_, when near the island of Minorco in 1796, we perceive how\r\ngreat is the protection science affords to the seaman. The frigate was\r\nstruck, it appears, at 12·25 P.M. by a heavy flash, which knocked three\r\nmen out of the tops, one of whom was killed on the spot. Within five\r\nminutes the ship was again struck, and her topmast was shivered to atoms.\r\nIn another minute a third shock shivered the foremast and mainmast, and\r\nset fire to the vessel in many places, raked the deck from end to end,\r\nkilled one man, paralyzed and burnt others, and knocked several persons\r\nout of the tops. In two parallel cases, the addition of a rod of copper\r\nmade all the difference between safety and havoc. The example of the Royal\r\nNavy is being followed by the merchant-service, but not so speedily as it\r\nshould be. When it is remembered that the treasure-clippers trading\r\nbetween Australia and this country often bring home nearly a million\r\nsterling in addition to a large complement of passengers, it does seem\r\nremarkable that the lightning apparatus is not considered as essential to\r\ntheir equipment as the boats, especially as they have to traverse an ocean\r\nwhere thunder-storms are of common occurrence. The cost of the whole\r\napparatus is not above £100, and if the cupidity of the merchant is not\r\nsufficient to induce him to supply it, we think that Government should\r\ncompel him, in order to insure the safety of the stream of passengers who\r\nannually leave our shores.\r\n\r\nIn the whole catalogue of disasters at sea, those which present the most\r\nterrible features are water-logged timber ships. The timber trade between\r\nGreat Britain and her American colonies employs a very considerable fleet\r\nof large vessels. As wood is a \"floating cargo,\" old worn-out\r\nWest-Indiamen, which would not be used for any other purpose, are freely\r\nemployed. A few years since, in addition to a full cargo, they carried\r\nheavy deck-loads, which so strained their shattered fabrics, that they\r\noften became water-logged, and were sometimes abandoned in the middle of\r\nthe Atlantic. The sufferings of the crews on these occasions in their open\r\nboats were appalling. Beating about for weeks on the waste of waters\r\nwithout food or drink beyond the rain that fell from heaven, they were\r\nobliged to sustain existence by preying on the bodies of their dead\r\ncompanions, and not rarely they cast lots for the living. Since the\r\npassing of the Act prohibiting deck-loading, these disasters are far less\r\nfrequent; but they have by no means ceased.[29] At the time we write there\r\nare several timber-ships drifting about the ocean, floating heaps of\r\ndesolation, at the mercy of the Gulf-stream, which will ultimately cast\r\nthem on some European shore, or drift them into the North Sea, to serve as\r\nfuel for the Esquimaux. In turning over the leaves of Lloyd's List, we\r\nfind indications of these dreary wrecks, which, clothed in seaweed, are\r\ndriven over the face of the waters, and sighted by passing ships, of which\r\nthey often cause the sudden destruction, whilst careering along in seeming\r\nsecurity. When these waifs and strays of the deep drift into\r\nmuch-frequented ocean paths, they are doubtless the cause of many of those\r\ndreadful catastrophes witnessed only by the eye of God, and our only\r\nknowledge of which is a curt notice on the \"Loss-book\" at Lloyd's,\r\n\"Foundered at Sea, date unknown.\" A recent instance, in which possibly no\r\ndamage was done, will yet suffice to show the risk. The _Virago_, loaded\r\nwith teak from Moulmein, in the Indian Ocean, to Queenstown, Ireland,\r\nbecame water-logged, and was abandoned on the 5th of March last, 155 miles\r\nsouth-west of Cape Clear. The next day she was passed by the American\r\nliner _Eagle_; on the 17th of the same month a steamer, on her way from\r\nRotterdam to Gibraltar, reports having seen her; on the 5th of April she\r\nwas passed by the _Naiad_ on her passage from Palermo to Milford; and on\r\nthe 15th the _Samarang_, on her way to Tenby, met with her; on the 18th\r\nshe was seen 160 miles off the Lizard, \"in a very dangerous position,\" by\r\nthe _Champion of the Seas_; again, on the 3rd of May, the _Alhambra_\r\nsteamer, on her voyage to Southampton, met her in latitude 47°; about the\r\nsame time and place she was seen by the _Peru_ steamer, \"and appeared as\r\nif run into;\" and, finally, on the 20th of May, the telegraph sends word\r\nthat she was stranded near Brest, and her cargo was being discharged. It\r\nis curious to note how, amid the tossing of the ocean, her name became\r\ngradually obliterated, till it was totally effaced, a type of the\r\nprogressive decay and final destruction of the vessel herself. At first\r\nshe is properly reported to Lloyd's as the _Virago_; the next ship makes\r\nher out to be the _Argo_; still later her cognomen is cut down to the\r\n--_go_; and then the name disappears until the French find her upon their\r\nstrand. Here we suppose her half-obliterated papers were found, and our\r\nneighbours, according to their usual wont, transmute the _Virago_ into the\r\n_Neroggogi_. From these reports it is evident that a number of large\r\nvessels passed quite close to the wreck, and it is even probable that a\r\ncollision may actually have occurred, and no one have been left to tell\r\nthe tale. In some cases, where the circumstances of wind and current are\r\nfavourable, water-logged ships are taken in tow by other vessels and\r\nbecome valuable prizes. When, however, these wrecks are in such a\r\ncondition that it is clear they cannot be brought in, we think it would be\r\nwell if they could be destroyed. A few pounds of powder, judiciously\r\nplaced, or a beam or two sawn across by the ship's carpenter, would break\r\nthe bond that binds these logs together, and, once separated, they would\r\nnot be likely to do much damage.\r\n\r\nMany disastrous wrecks can be distinctly traced either to a defective\r\ncompass, or to an ignorance of the effects upon it of the magnetism of the\r\nship's iron. There is a melancholy example in the loss of H.M.S. _Apollo_,\r\nof thirty-six guns, in 1803, with forty sail of merchant ships, out of a\r\nconvoy of sixty-nine vessels, bound for the West Indies. The _Apollo_ was\r\nleading the way, with her train of outward-bound sugar ships following in\r\nher wake, little suspecting the catastrophe which was to follow. At the\r\nvery moment her defective compasses drove her ashore, she imagined she was\r\nsome forty miles off the coast at Portugal, and so close was the merchant\r\nfleet upon her, that upwards of half of them took the ground and were\r\ndashed to pieces. More recently we have had the instances of the\r\n_Reliance_ and _Conqueror_, wrecked near Ambleteuse, on the French coast,\r\nin sight of the cliffs of Albion, after voyaging from India. The former is\r\nknown to have had an immense iron tank on board, the influence of which\r\nupon her compasses must have been very great. The _Birkenhead_, wrecked\r\nnear the Cape of Good Hope, and the ship _Tayleur_, in the Irish Channel\r\nare additional instances of the destruction to which the trembling finger\r\nof the magnetic needle points the way, where ignorance or wilfulness have\r\nplaced impediments to its truthful action.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous errors that may be classed under the general term of\r\ncompass defaults, we may mention defective compasses arising from\r\nimperfect workmanship, or from an ignorance of the principles of\r\nmechanical and magnetical science, compasses perfectly adjusted but placed\r\ninjudiciously either with reference to the magnetism of the ship, or in\r\nimmediate proximity to concealed and unsuspected portions of iron.\r\nIgnorance of the degree of compass error arising from the ship's\r\nmagnetism, and of its varying amount in changes of geographic position,\r\nand a consequent belief, that in all places and under all circumstances\r\nthe needle is true to the north, are frequent causes of shipwreck.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the defective mechanical construction of compasses, it must\r\nbe admitted that great improvements have taken place of late years, and\r\nthe chief credit, we believe, is due to the British Admiralty. Nearly\r\ntwenty years ago they instituted a Committee of Inquiry, and the silent\r\nworking of the measures then advocated, and the adoption of the\r\nimprovements suggested first under the direction of the late Captain\r\nJohnston, and more recently under that of Mr. Frederick Evans, R.N., have\r\ninfused into the manufacturers, and a large portion of the mercantile\r\nmarine and shipowners, a degree of caution, skill, and attention to\r\ndetails, which has brought forth good fruit. A large portion of the\r\nsuperior compasses of the United States navy are manufactured in this\r\ncountry, entirely on the Admiralty pattern, and several foreign\r\ngovernments have recently obtained the same instruments as models. It\r\nmust not however be supposed that defective compasses have ceased to\r\nexist. Our coasting vessels and many of our noble sailing ships are\r\nmiserably equipped, and there are many captains who still look on the\r\ncompass as a cheap and common article, fit to be classed with hooks and\r\nthimbles and other articles of the boatswain's storeroom.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that great errors in navigation are induced by\r\ninattention to placing the compasses. It is common to see the binnacle\r\nwithin two feet, and even less, of the massive iron-work of the rudder\r\nwheel, which again is in immediate contiguity with an iron sternpost. The\r\nlocal deviation is consequently great, magnet adjustment is had recourse\r\nto, and a temporary alleviation of the evil follows, which is only\r\nmagnified on the ship approaching some distant port. Numerous examples are\r\non record of iron being introduced by some addition to the equipment of\r\nthe ship, which has perhaps been lost in consequence within a few hours\r\nafter quitting port.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes which thus operate, we may name the fancy rails leading\r\nto state-cabins and saloons. These, beneath a highly-polished covering of\r\nbrass, often conceal many hundredweights of iron. Cabin stoves and\r\nfunnels, immediately under and alongside the compass, are frequently\r\nunsuspected. A noble transport, during the late war, carrying troops and\r\nstores, pursued her course by day with unswerving fidelity, but at night\r\nthe compass was as wild as the waves themselves. After diligent search it\r\nwas found that the brazier, in preparing the binnacle lamps, had\r\nintroduced a concealed iron-wire hoop to strengthen their frame-work. The\r\nstowage of iron in cargo does not receive the attention it deserves, and\r\nwe consider it should be imperative for every vessel which carries it to\r\nbe swung for the local deviation before quitting port, and a certificate\r\nduly lodged before clearing the Customs. When the _Agamemnon_ adjusted\r\ncompasses preparatory to sailing upon the last unsuccessful expedition to\r\nlay the Atlantic cable, it was discovered that the presence of the\r\nenormous coil in her hold caused a deviation of no less than seventeen\r\ndegrees! Had she been a merchant ship, no similar verification would have\r\nbeen made, and the sign-post which showed the path upon the trackless\r\nwaters would only have pointed to mislead.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how much misapprehension on the nature of magnetic action\r\nexists even among men of high intelligence. A competent witness, in a\r\nrecent law-trial, in a case of wreck, arising chiefly from a want of\r\nknowledge of the laws of magnetism in the navigation of the ship, stated\r\nthat seamen in general believed, that if a cargo of iron was covered over,\r\nits effects were cut off from the compass. A leading counsel in the case\r\nsympathized with the general ignorance, because he confessed that he\r\nshared it. The adjustment of compasses by magnets is a most delicate\r\noperation, and has received much attention from some of our leading men in\r\nscience. An able committee, under the auspices of the Board of Trade, are\r\nnow engaged, in the midst of an iron navy, in the port of Liverpool, in\r\nelucidating the whole of the subject. We feel bound, however, to record\r\nour opinion against the indiscriminate employment of all the nostrums\r\nprescribed by the compass-doctors or quacks at many of our seaports. Let\r\nthe shipowner consult such reports of the Liverpool Committee as have been\r\nalready published, or follow the Admiralty plan of having at least one\r\ngood compass in a position free from all magnetic influences. In some of\r\nthe large ocean steamers a standard compass is fitted high up in the mizen\r\nmast, and we hear that it is proposed to build a special stage on board\r\nthe _Great Eastern_, in order to keep the compass from being affected by\r\nthe immense body of iron in her fabric.\r\n\r\nA perusal of the evidence given in those inquiries which take place\r\nrelative to the loss of ships, under the Mercantile Marine Act, would lead\r\nto the supposition that defective charts were even a greater cause of\r\nwrecks than compass defaults; but this is not the case. The fact is,\r\nincorrect charts afford an excuse for a master who may have lost his ship,\r\nwhich is but too readily accepted by the members of courts of inquiry and\r\nof courts martial. The defence set up for the wreck of the _Great Britain_\r\nsteamer, in Dundrum Bay, on the east coast of Ireland, was, that St.\r\nJohn's Light, placed two or three years previously, was not inserted in\r\nthe most recent charts of the Irish Channel procurable at Liverpool, and\r\nthat consequently it was mistaken for the light at the Calf of Man. But\r\nthese two lights are at least thirty miles apart, and it is monstrous to\r\nsuppose that a steamer should be so much out of her reckoning within a few\r\nhours of leaving port. Again, in the more recent case of the wreck of the\r\n_Madrid_ steamer, off Point Hombre, at the entrance of Vigo Bay, several\r\nmasters were examined, who stated that they had invariably passed equally\r\nclose to the same headland, in reliance on the correctness of the chart.\r\n\"Under these circumstances,\" said the Court, \"the loss of the _Madrid_\r\ncannot be attributed to the wrongful act or default of the captain.\" His\r\ncertificate was therefore returned; and, at the same time, he was informed\r\nthat, as a general rule, \"150 yards is not a sufficiently wide berth to\r\nallow in passing headlands.\" We should think not; and furthermore we\r\nimagine that, if the omission of every insignificant rock close to shore,\r\nin government charts, is to be taken as an excuse for shaving a dangerous\r\nheadland, we may expect to hear of many repetitions of the disaster. The\r\n_Orion_, wrecked on the west coast of Scotland, and the much-abused\r\n_Transit_, in the Banca Strait, owed their fate to the unseaman-like love\r\nof hugging the shore.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that the charts in common use on board\r\nmerchant ships are very faulty, both with respect to the position and\r\ncharacter of lights, buoys, and beacons, and to the variation of the\r\ncompass, which is not unfrequently half a point wrong,--an error which may\r\nbe fatal in shaping a course up Channel or in a narrow sea. From this\r\ngreat evil the seaman has, at present, no protection. The remedy lies in\r\nthe hands of the legislature, who have only to compel all chart-sellers to\r\nwarrant their charts corrected up to the latest date, at least with\r\nrespect to lights and buoys. There are but three or four publishers of\r\nprivate charts, as far as we are aware, in the United Kingdom; their stock\r\nof plates cannot be very large, and, once examined and set right, the\r\ncorrections and additions could be easily inserted. Either the Board of\r\nTrade or the Admiralty should be entrusted with this duty. The latter are\r\nobliged to correct their own charts, and we understand it is the practice\r\nof the hydrographer to cause every new light, or change of light, or buoy,\r\nor beacon, to be inserted in the plate within twenty-four hours of the\r\ntime of the intelligence reaching the Admiralty. A large number of notices\r\nto mariners--upwards, we believe, of a thousand a-week--are printed and\r\npublished, both by the Trinity House and the Admiralty, and distributed\r\namong those connected with shipping; and every chart-seller should be\r\nbound under a penalty to give proof to the Board of Trade or to the\r\nAdmiralty that he had inserted the corrections in his copper-plate within\r\nforty-eight hours of the appearance of the notice.\r\n\r\nIt is a startling fact that the materials for constructing charts, even of\r\nparts of the waters which wash the shores of Europe, are not yet in\r\nexistence. Of the coast of Europe generally we are tolerably well\r\ninformed, although there are many portions that require closer\r\nexamination; but on the African and Asiatic portions of the Mediterranean,\r\nthe early seat of civilization and the best known sea in the world, there\r\nis still much to be done. When M. de Lesseps brought forward his romantic\r\nproposal for a Suez Canal, no survey existed of the coast of Egypt from\r\nAlexandria to El Arish. Of Syria we know nothing accurately; Cyprus,\r\nRhodes, and the western half of Crete, are still almost blanks. But it is\r\nin the eastern seas and in the Asiatic Archipelago that we are most at\r\nfault. The Persian Gulf, portions of the coast of India, Ceylon, Burmah,\r\nMalacca, Cochin China, the Yellow Sea, Corea, Japan, the southern and\r\neastern parts of Borneo, Celebes, &c., are hardly so correctly mapped as\r\nthe mountains in the moon. The north and east coasts of New Guinea, again,\r\nare unsurveyed. As long as the Spice Islands, and the unknown lands washed\r\nby the Indian seas, were given up to pirates, and to the imagination of\r\npoets, this want was not felt; but now that our clippers swarm in these\r\nseas, and that Australia herself is beginning to trade there extensively,\r\nwe shall assuredly hear of fearful shipwrecks from want of surveys. Then,\r\nindeed, it will be truly said, that imperfect charts are the cause of\r\nshipwrecks, unless, when India passes under the Imperial Government,\r\nvigorous steps are taken to remedy this grievous defect.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the question of imperfect charts, is the state of\r\nthe lights, buoys, and beacons around the coast--those fixed and floating\r\nsentinels set around the island to guide and direct the weather-beaten\r\nmariner. A few years ago we should have had to bewail our shortcomings in\r\nthe number of these aids to navigation, and have had to point to them as\r\nprominent causes of shipwreck. The report of the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons on Lighthouses, in 1845, shows the want that then\r\nexisted, not only on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland, but even at the\r\nentrance of the River Thames. Much, however, has recently been done. It\r\nappears, from the address of the Prince Consort, at the annual Trinity\r\nHouse dinner, that 77 lighthouses, 32 floating light-vessels, and 420\r\nbuoys and beacons, under charge of the corporation, are now distributed\r\naround the coasts of England alone. Great praise is due to the elder\r\nbrethren of the Trinity House for their care in lighting the Prince's\r\nChannel, and especially for their admirable works now in course of\r\nconstruction under Mr. James Walker, C.E.; among which we may instance the\r\nnew lighthouses at the Needles, at Whitby, and at St. Ives, the\r\nlight-tower on the Bishop Rock, off Scilly, and on the Smalls off\r\nPembroke. In Scotland, also, several new lights have been established; and\r\nsome of the buoys have been coloured on a systematic plan--red buoys being\r\nplaced on the starboard hand, and black buoys on the port hand, on\r\nentering a harbour from seaward, according to the mode adopted in France,\r\nBelgium, and Holland. This system, however, presents difficulties where\r\nthere are several channels, as at the mouth of the Thames; but there are\r\nmany places in which it might be applied with advantage. At present, we\r\nbelieve, the river Tees is buoyed on exactly the reverse plan; and in some\r\nof the large ports of the kingdom a local scheme is adopted, which\r\ncompletely closes the navigation to all but the local pilots, for whose\r\nspecial advantage this secret system appears to be maintained. The\r\nadversaries of a simple and uniform method of buoying the coast do,\r\nindeed, urge that it would put the key of our harbours into the hands of\r\nour enemies; but this argument is so puerile that it is hardly worth\r\nnotice. If we cannot maintain the integrity of our waters by force, we\r\ncertainly shall never maintain it by cunning.\r\n\r\nThe want of lights on the shores of Ireland has long been a cause of\r\ncomplaint. Till within a few years, on a coast which is the land-fall of\r\nnearly all vessels that cross the Atlantic from Canada, Nova Scotia,\r\nBoston, and New York, there were spaces of sixty, seventy, and eighty\r\nmiles without a light! Yet during all this time light dues were levied on\r\nthe Americans, and other nations, who were thus treated to a sample of\r\nIrish reciprocity. On the coasts of the United States there were ample\r\nlights and no light dues, while on the coast of Ireland the lights were\r\nfew and the dues heavy. We trust that the royal commission which, on the\r\nmotion of Lord Clarence Paget, has lately made its report respecting the\r\nstate of the lights and buoys of the country, will give a stimulus to the\r\nimprovement which has already begun, and either get rid of these light\r\ndues or recommend a more equitable method of levying them. One penny a ton\r\non the actual tonnage of the country, paid once a year, would be\r\nsufficient to maintain all the lights in the kingdom, and would be more\r\nsimple than the present complicated system of paying every fresh voyage,\r\nwhich bears so unjustly on the coasting trade. The time, we believe, is\r\nclose at hand when the lights themselves will be revolutionized. It is of\r\nthe last importance to the mariner that the brightest and best light that\r\nscience can furnish shall be held out upon the sunken rock, or perpetually\r\nmaintained upon the dangerous headland. Yet it cannot be denied that we\r\nhave nothing better than oil lamps for the purpose; and though the most\r\nprofound science and the most delicate art have been employed to make the\r\nmost of this feeble power, the fact remains, that we have not advanced\r\nbeyond the oil-wick of the last century in our attempts to provide a light\r\nwhich will throw its beams far and wide over the sea, and pierce through\r\nthe fogs and drifting snow-storms of the dark winter nights. It is not\r\nless strange that we are behind the French, and even the Spaniards, with\r\nrespect to the mechanism necessary to concentrate the little light we\r\nhave. In the two former countries the vast majority of the lighthouses are\r\nupon the dioptric principle, the whole light of the lamps being\r\nconcentrated in occasional flashes, by means of a powerful system of\r\nlenses, forming a complete cage of glass. England, on the contrary,\r\nemploys in most of her lighthouses the old metal reflectors; and, as Lord\r\nClarence Paget justly observes, the voyager leaving Folkstone will clearly\r\nappreciate the difference between the two systems, by comparing the\r\ndioptric light flashing from the far distant Cape Griz Nez with the feeble\r\nspark of the English reflector light close to him at Dungeness. It has\r\nbeen the great aim of the constructors of these powerful lenses to throw\r\nall the light of the lamps into parallel rays, so that only a thin disc of\r\nlight is cast upon the sea; but, as Mr. Findlay truly remarked in his\r\npaper read at the Society of Arts, we have at last over-refined, and a\r\nfearful shipwreck has already been the result. The _Dunbar_, after making\r\na prosperous voyage to our antipodes, was wrecked at the Sydney headland,\r\nwithin sight of her port. This dangerous cliff was surmounted by a\r\nreflector light which sent a thin disc of rays, under which the ship\r\npassed in a fog. Had a few divergent rays been allowed to light the danger\r\nat her feet, she would have escaped her fate.\r\n\r\nAnother great and increasing difficulty arising from the limited\r\ncapabilities of the present burners, is the fact that steamers are\r\nbeginning to show lights as powerful as those exhibited in lighthouses of\r\nthe inferior order and in the light ships. Hence a confusion is growing up\r\nbetween the fixed and the moving lights, which threatens to produce most\r\ndisastrous consequences. As recently as February last, the _Leander_, an\r\nAmerican barque, proceeding down St. George's Channel, saw a light which\r\nshe mistook for that on the Tuskar Rock, and, when too late, discovered\r\nthat it belonged to the screw steamer _North America_, which was coming\r\nright ahead. A fearful collision was the consequence, and the unfortunate\r\nship with nearly all her crew was sent to the bottom. It has been found\r\nabsolutely necessary to change the light in the Nore light-ship from a\r\nfixed to a revolving one, to distinguish it from the numerous powerful\r\nlights carried by steamers at anchor or when passing along the Thames.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to increase the illuminating power of the\r\nburners. In 1832 Lieutenant Drummond proposed the use of the oxy-hydrous\r\nlight, and as far as the intensity of light was concerned the new agent\r\nwas perfectly successful, the Drummond light at seventy miles' distance\r\nappearing nearer to the spectator than the ordinary reflector light at\r\ntwelve miles. But it was found impossible to maintain a steady light by\r\nthis system, and it was therefore abandoned. Since then Professor Holmes\r\nhas been making experiments with the magnetic electric light. The\r\napparatus is said to consist of a series of very powerful magnets, around\r\nthe poles of which the helices are made to revolve by means of a\r\nsteam-engine. A powerful magnetic current is thus produced, which passing\r\nthrough carbon pencils shows a splendid light. The great difficulty of\r\nthis and of other similar propositions to obtain the light by passing the\r\ncurrent through two points, is to so regulate them that they shall always\r\nremain at the same distance apart, for any variation would immediately\r\naffect the intensity of the light. This desideratum has not yet been\r\naccomplished, neither do we think it possible of accomplishment. Professor\r\nWay has, however, we imagine, solved the problem by substituting a running\r\nstream of mercury in place of these points.\r\n\r\nA moment's inspection of the grim wreck chart leads us to reflect whether\r\nthe care taken to warn mariners of their danger is not in many cases the\r\nimmediate cause of their seeking it. If we note, for instance, the\r\nlighthouses fringing St. George's and the English Channel, we are struck\r\nwith the extraordinary fact that there we find the greatest congregation\r\nof those dismal dots which indicate loss of life and property, and it\r\nwould seem as though ships like moths were attracted and destroyed by the\r\nlight. Such, no doubt, is often the case. Ships bound up Channel make for\r\nthe nearest light, and from that shape their course until they meet with\r\nthe next light. They feel their way, as it were, in the dark night by the\r\nhandrail of these guides, and sometimes stumble on the very rocks that\r\nsupport the beacons themselves--the fog, as in the case of the _Dunbar_,\r\nallowing them to get within and under the danger flash. The disasters\r\nproduced by this system of groping about sunken rocks and bluff headlands\r\nhas led Mr. Thomas Herbert of the Trinity House to propose the lighting of\r\nthe Mid Channel. His system is to moor floating lighthouses, of a form\r\nwhich secures a steadiness sufficient for the purpose, and he is thus\r\nenabled to place a row of most powerful lights at little comparative\r\nexpense up the very centres of the two great channels of English commerce,\r\nand indeed of the commerce of the world. A ship on entering the Channel\r\nwould immediately make for the westernmost of this line of \"Fairway\r\nlights,\" instead of looking out for the Lizard, and once having made it,\r\nthe course would be free of all possible danger. Eight floating light\r\ntowers extending from the westernmost one, forty miles south-west of\r\nScilly, to Dungeness, would add enormously to the security of this\r\nwreck-strewn sea. The outermost of these lights Mr. Herbert proposes\r\nshould be put in telegraphic communication with the shore, by which means\r\nmerchants and consignees would be made acquainted with the arrival of\r\nvessels full a day earlier than at present. By this means also Greenwich\r\ntime could be laid on to the station, and enable the anxious captain to\r\nverify the correctness of his chronometer up to the latest possible\r\nmoment. Such a station might further serve as a depôt for water and fresh\r\nprovisions, so much required by vessels detained by contrary winds in the\r\nChops of the Channel, and to provide which ships are now annually sent out\r\nby the Admiralty. Without expressing any decided opinion upon this scheme,\r\nit seems to us to possess sufficient plausibility to warrant inquiry. If\r\nthere should be no insurmountable practical objection,--and we have heard\r\npractical men speak well of it,--there can be little doubt that it would\r\ndissipate in no small degree the dangers of the Channel, without\r\ninterfering with the present lights, which would always be useful for the\r\ncoasting trade.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most frequent cause of wreck, especially on our own coast, is\r\nnegligence on the part of the master. If we analyze the cases of collision\r\nthat occurred in the year 1857, we are surprised to find that by far the\r\nlarger portion of them occur in the open sea, and in clear bright weather.\r\nOut of 277 collisions, involving total and partial loss, bad look-out was\r\nthe cause of 88, and neglect of the rule of the road of 33 collisions. It\r\nis a saying among sailors that if the three L's are attended to--Lead,\r\nLatitude, and Look-out,--a ship is safe; and no more apt saying could have\r\nbeen uttered. Simple as the casting of the lead is, it is almost\r\ninvariably found, when the causes of wreck are inquired into, that this\r\nprecaution has been neglected. The _Ava_ mail-steamer was undoubtedly lost\r\noff Trincomalee, in February last, owing to this omission. The lead is not\r\nonly capable of telling the soundings, which alone would warn the mariner\r\nof the approach of shoal water; but, when armed, it is capable of bringing\r\na voice from the deep to say on what coast the ship may be. Had the\r\nmasters of either the _Reliance_ or _Conqueror_ cast the lead, they would\r\nnot only have known that their vessel were getting into shallow water, but\r\nthat they were upon the French coast; for the lead brings up a coarser\r\nsand from the shores of our neighbours than from the opposite coast on the\r\nEnglish side. The question of latitude is a question which tests the\r\nnautical knowledge of the captain. A man who can take celestial\r\nobservations correctly is not very likely to be deficient in a knowledge\r\nof navigation. The differences between masters of ships in this respect\r\nare very marked. Captain Basil Hall tells us, in his \"Fragments of Voyages\r\nand Travels,\" that on a voyage from California to Rio, the first land he\r\nsaw was on either side of him, upon the clearing off of a fog at the\r\nentrance of Rio de Janeiro. With no other guide than science he had hit\r\nhis port without sighting land, after a voyage of many thousand miles.\r\nWith this we may contrast a case given in the Report on Shipwrecks for\r\n1836, in which the brig _Henry_, of Cork, bound to St. John's, New\r\nBrunswick, with seventy passengers on board, was fallen in with by the\r\n_Andromeda_, of New York, in a starving condition; her master, by his own\r\nreckoning, being 800 miles to the westward of his true position. This man\r\nmust have been one of those who, as the sailors say, \"come in at the cabin\r\nwindows, instead of working his way up through the hawse-holes.\" Errors of\r\nthis kind are not likely to occur so often as formerly, thanks to the\r\nworking of the Mercantile Marine Act, which will, we think, prevent the\r\nrecurrence of the grosser mistakes in navigation. No greater blessing was\r\never conferred on the merchant shipping of this country than a law which\r\ncompels the holding an inquiry by competent persons in all cases of\r\ncasualty. It is abused, as any measure is sure to be that rigidly sets its\r\nface against misconduct; but it has already done infinite good, and would\r\ndo still more if its provisions were strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nIt is often supposed that the shifting of sandbanks is a cause of wreck,\r\nbut there does not seem sufficient ground for this opinion. We have heard\r\nmany marvellous stories relative to the shifting of the Goodwin, and of\r\nthe sudden exposure in full preservation of the hulls of long lost ships.\r\nThese tales are all poetical, though the edge of the bank may here and\r\nthere give way and expose the ribs of some vessel long since sucked in.\r\nWhat change there is in the Goodwin, and it is of a very gradual nature,\r\ntakes place on the western or inshore side: its eastern side is as steep\r\nas a wall, and retains the position it had when the first exact survey of\r\nit was made. The Brake Sand in the Downs off Ramsgate seems to have moved\r\nbodily inshore or to the westward, and there is a slight disposition to\r\nchange in sands known by the names of the Leigh Middle and Yantlet Ground\r\nin Sea Reach, at the entrance of the river Thames. The Yarmouth and\r\nLowestoff sands shift slightly. A channel, or gat as it is called, opens\r\nnow in one place and now at another; but these variations are soon known\r\nand buoyed by the Trinity House. Changes take place at the entrance of the\r\nMersey, but the surveyor of the river quickly marks the deviations and\r\nmakes them known to the pilots. On the north-east coast of England more\r\nextensive alterations have taken place; a large portion of Holderness, in\r\nYorkshire, has been washed away, and the sea has broken through Spurn\r\nPoint, threatening to make it once more an island. At Landguard Point, at\r\nthe entrance of Harwich harbour, the injudicious removal of a barrier of\r\ncement stone, by which the heavy stroke of the sea has been allowed free\r\naction on the shore, has caused the sand to be heaped up within the last\r\nhalf-century, until a shingle beach now rears its head seven feet above\r\nthe level of high water; where, not many years since, a line-of-battle\r\nship could have sailed into the harbour. Another remarkable increase of\r\nland is at Dungeness, where the shingle has extended at the average rate\r\nof three yards a year, since the beginning of the Christian era. But\r\nalthough of vast importance to the engineer in dealing with harbours,\r\nthese changes are not productive of shipwreck.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of shipwreck on the shores of the United Kingdom is\r\nundoubtedly the want of harbours of refuge. From the parliamentary returns\r\nit appears that the tonnage of vessels which entered and cleared from the\r\nports of this country in 1857 amounted to 23,178,782 tons, or in round\r\nnumbers 232,000 vessels. Even this falls short of the number of vessels\r\nthat are constantly passing and repassing along our coasts, and which, on\r\nthe springing up of a sudden gale, are liable to wreck, inasmuch as it\r\nonly gives those which are carrying cargo. It does not include colliers\r\nand other vessels in ballast, nor ships of war, nor small coasters laden\r\nwith stone, lime, &c., all of which would swell the amount to full 300,000\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the number of casualties to shipping on the\r\ncoasts and within the seas of the United Kingdom has averaged 1,025 a\r\nyear; that the loss of life has amounted to 830 a year, and that the\r\ndestruction of property reaches a million and a half. It is not an\r\nuncommon occurrence for a single gale to strew the coasts with wrecks. In\r\nthe three separate gales which occurred in the years 1821, 1824, and 1829,\r\nthere were lost on the east coast of England, in the short space between\r\nthe Humber and the Tees, 169 vessels. In the single gale of the 31st of\r\nAugust, 1833, 61 vessels were lost on the sands in the North Sea and on\r\nthe east coast of England. In the tremendous gale of the 13th of January,\r\n1843, as many as 103 vessels were wrecked off the coasts of the British\r\nIsles, and among them 13 large ships off the port of Liverpool alone. In\r\nthe gale of 1846, 39 vessels got ashore in Hartlepool; and in the month of\r\nMarch, 1850, 134 vessels were stranded or came into collision. In the gale\r\nof the 25th of September, 1851, as many as 117 vessels were wrecked; and\r\nfor each of the four first months of the year 1858 the Board of Trade\r\nreturns show that there has been from 140 to 150 casualties, or from four\r\nto five a day. These facts are sufficient to prove the appalling loss of\r\nlife and of property, and the absolute necessity which exists for\r\nestablishing on the most exposed and frequented positions of our coasts\r\nthat shelter which the sailor has a right to expect in the time of need.\r\n\r\nFormerly in the reports of the shipwreck committees so many vague\r\ngeneralities were dwelt upon, that the House of Commons had no definite\r\nconclusions upon which to proceed. This is no longer the case. In the\r\nevidence laid before the select committee of the House, when inquiring\r\ninto refuge harbours, in the year 1858, it is shown that there are certain\r\ndistricts in which wreck is the normal state. Nearly one-third of all the\r\ncasualties take place on the east coast of Great Britain, and in 1857 it\r\nwas more than one-half! Nay, it is all but demonstrated that the larger\r\npart of these occur within some seventy miles of coast, or between\r\nFlamborough Head and the Tyne. Here, then, the subject is narrowed to a\r\npoint. The immediate vicinity of the coal ports must be the site of a\r\nharbour of refuge--some spot which all colliers, light and loaded, pass,\r\nwhether it be in the bight of the bay (or the bag of the net), as Tees\r\nBay, or whether it be farther to the southward, near Filey Bay. The exact\r\nlocality may require careful consideration; but the question of situation\r\non the east coast of England is now narrowed to a distance of fifty miles.\r\nOne unexpected fact has come to light in the course of this investigation,\r\nnamely, that of the colliers lost on this part of the coast, the\r\nproportion of loaded vessels to light is as 5 to 1.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Scotland there is a sad want of deep-water harbours of\r\nrefuge. From the Pentland Frith southward to Cromarty, a distance of 100\r\nmiles, there are none but tidal harbours, all inaccessible for twelve\r\nhours out of the twenty-four. It is the same from the Moray Frith round by\r\nPeterhead to the Frith of Forth, with the exception of the Tay. Yet it is\r\nalong this coast that a great part of our Baltic trade, and all the\r\nGreenland, Archangel, Davis Strait, and much of the Canadian and United\r\nStates trade must pass. In addition to this traffic, both of these coast\r\ndistricts are remarkable as the great scene of the herring fishery.\r\nPeterhead has its 250 fishing-boats, Fraserburgh and Buckie more than 400\r\nsail; while farther north, off the coast of Caithness, more than 1,200\r\nfishing boats, manned by 6,000 men, nightly pursue their calling, exposed\r\nto the proverbial suddenness of a North-sea gale. Here then, in some\r\nportion of this district, either at Peterhead, Frazerburgh, or Wick, a\r\nrefuge harbour is imperatively required.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of England, between the Land's End and the south coast\r\nof Wales, including the Bristol Channel, shelter is absolutely needed. The\r\ntrade of the Irish Sea, including Liverpool, Glasgow, and Belfast, and the\r\ngreat and increasing traffic of the coal ports of Newport, Cardiff, and\r\nSwansea, in addition to the trade of Bristol and Gloucester, urgently call\r\nfor some refuge. For the former probably a harbour near the entrance of\r\nthe Channel, as at St. Ives, would be the most useful; for the trade of\r\nthe upper portion of the Bristol Channel, Clovelly on the south coast,\r\nLundy Island in the centre, and Swansea Bay on the north, have been the\r\nsites particularly recommended in the evidence. On the coasts of Ireland,\r\nthe rocks named the Skerries, near Portrush, on the north coast, Lough\r\nCarlingford on the east, and Waterford on the south, have been mentioned\r\nas places where good harbours may be obtained at but a trifling outlay.\r\n\r\nIt appears from good evidence that the existing tidal harbours around our\r\ncoasts are susceptible of great improvements for the purposes of joining\r\nharbours of refuge in case of need. We think this supplementary view of\r\nthe question one of much importance. It is shown that the small sum of\r\n2,500_l._ a year, which the Scottish Fishery Board is empowered to grant\r\nannually, to meet double the amount raised from private sources, has been\r\nof much value, and has given rise to many piers and fishery harbours on\r\nthe coasts of Scotland. A somewhat similar measure applied to harbours\r\ngenerally would be of the utmost value. There are many in which the loan\r\nof a small sum of money, at a low rate of interest, would confer a great\r\nbenefit. The enormous parliamentary and other fees attendant on getting a\r\nHarbour Act are so ruinous, that many of the lesser harbours are kept in a\r\nstate of decay from the impossibility of raising funds to restore them. We\r\nare glad to see that Mr. Henry Paull, M.P. for St. Ives, has given notice\r\nin the House of a bill to remedy this evil, and to enable some public\r\ndepartment, such as the Admiralty and Board of Trade, to grant the\r\nnecessary powers for raising funds to execute _bonâ fide_ improvements. We\r\ncordially wish him success, and trust that he will persevere until his\r\nproposal has become the law of the land.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be imagined that the wrecks and collisions that occur\r\non our own coasts formed only an insignificant portion of the casualties\r\nthat take place throughout the world. But this is not so. The trade of the\r\nworld is drawn towards our shores, and these shores are washed by narrow\r\nand therefore dangerous seas. Hence we can account for a fact which would\r\notherwise appear astounding, that the losses on our own coasts form nearly\r\na third of the losses throughout the world. According to the returns of\r\nLloyd's agents, the average annual number of casualties and of vessels\r\nthat have touched the ground within the last four years in all seas is\r\n3,254; whilst, as we have already stated, those that occur upon our coast\r\naverage 1,025. Long as the list of home disasters is, it is at least\r\nsatisfactory to find that the more severe cases are not increasing. The\r\nofficial record of these casualties does not extend back farther than the\r\nyear 1852, but the annual returns since that date, which we append, are on\r\nthe whole encouraging.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |               | 1852. | 1853. | 1854. | 1855. | 1856. | 1857. |\r\n  |---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  | Wrecks        |   958 |   759 |   893 |   894 |   837 |   866 |\r\n  | Collisions    |    57 |    73 |    94 |   247 |   316 |   277 |\r\n  |               |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n  |      TOTAL    |  1015 |   832 |   987 |  1141 |  1153 |  1143 |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFrom this Table it will be seen that while there is an absolute decrease\r\nwith respect to wrecks, which is due, no doubt, to the greater\r\nintelligence of the masters and the working of the Mercantile Marine Act,\r\na large and increasing number of collisions has happened. The latter\r\ncircumstance is important, and in all probability is attributable to two\r\ncauses, the vast addition that has taken place of late years to the trade\r\nof the country, and the manner in which steam is supplanting the use of\r\nsails. If we cast back our glance only fifteen years, and compare the\r\ntrade of that period with what it is at present, we are astonished at the\r\nrate at which our commerce has advanced. We find it stated in the\r\nstatistical abstract of the year 1858, that the amount of British shipping\r\nwhich entered and cleared from the ports of the United Kingdom in 1843 was\r\n7,181,179 tons, and of foreign 2,643,383 tons, making together an\r\naggregate tonnage of 9,824,562 tons. In 1857, however, the tonnage of\r\nBritish shipping entered and cleared had increased to 13,694,107, and the\r\nforeign shipping to 9,484,685 tons, making an aggregate quantity of no\r\nless than 23,178,792 tons; thus showing an increase of 13,354,230 tons, or\r\n136 per cent., in fourteen years! With this prodigious addition to the\r\nships passing our shores, we have reason to be thankful that wrecks are\r\nnot of far more frequent occurrence, and it will account for the otherwise\r\nalarming multiplication of the number of collisions. And not only are\r\nthere more ships, but a greater proportion of them are propelled by steam.\r\nA parliamentary paper, not long since published, shows that the number of\r\nsteamers employed in the Home and Foreign trade has increased from 414 in\r\n1849 to 899 in 1857; that is, the number of vessels most prone to come\r\ninto collision has more than doubled within the last eight years, and\r\nwhile the sailing vessels have increased during this period only 3·49 per\r\ncent., the latter have increased 117·15 per cent., the proportion of\r\nsteamers to sailing vessels having advanced from 2·22 per cent. in 1849 to\r\n4·87 per cent. in 1857. Bearing in mind the speed at which steamers go,\r\nand the manner in which their powerful lights, just introduced, simulate\r\nthose of lighthouses and lightships, the increase of collisions is not\r\nsurprising. There can be no doubt that the introduction of coloured\r\nside-lights, which all vessels, both sailing and steamers, must\r\nhenceforward exhibit, will enable the direction in which another ship is\r\nstanding to be distinguished, which was not the case heretofore.\r\n\r\nThe most important object after the prevention of shipwreck is that of\r\nrescuing the crew when the catastrophe takes place. All along the\r\ncoast--grouped thicker together where the fatal black dots indicate\r\ndangerous spots--we find rude marks indicative of the presence of\r\nlife-boats. Thus, whenever the dangerous headland or the hidden shoal\r\nthreatens destruction to the mariner, the means of preservation are close\r\nat hand. Of these boats, each manned by a fearless crew of twelve\r\nvolunteers, there are 141 stationed along the coast; seventy being under\r\nthe management of the National Life-Boat Institution, and seventy-one\r\nunder the direction of various corporations and local authorities. To the\r\nprincely conduct of the Duke of Northumberland, the President of the\r\nNational Life-Boat Institution, we owe the present improved condition of\r\nthe means of saving life in cases of shipwreck. As far back as the year\r\n1790, two humble boatbuilders on the banks of the Tyne, Greathead and\r\nWouldhave (who were encouraged and fostered by the then Duke of\r\nNorthumberland), invented the broad, curved form of life-boat, with\r\nair-cases, which was chiefly in use around our coasts. This model was\r\nafterwards much departed from, and by degrees the most imperfect boats\r\n(provided they were lined with what were supposed to be air-tight cases)\r\nwere dignified with the name of life-boats. The many casualties that\r\nhappened to these craft, which were built by rule of thumb rather than\r\nupon any scientific system, brought them into much disrepute. Too often,\r\nindeed, their hardy crews, instead of fulfilling their mission, were\r\ndrowned on the way. In some instances, owing to their defective build,\r\nthey turned _end over end_ when struck by a heavy sea, and, from want of\r\nthe power to right themselves when capsized, the unfortunate men were\r\nencaged beneath them. To prevent the recurrence of such disastrous\r\naccidents, the Duke of Northumberland offered a premium for the production\r\nof a model life-boat, and the result was the exhibition of several\r\nrespectable contrivances. Not one of them, however, fulfilled all the\r\nprescribed conditions; nor was it until after several trials and many\r\nexperiments that the present life-boat was completed. It appears to be the\r\nproduction of a committee and not of an individual; but the chief credit\r\nof it is due to Mr. Peake, of the Royal Dockyard, Woolwich; to Joseph\r\nProwse, junior, foreman of the same yard; and to Messrs. Forrestt, the\r\nwell-known boat-builders of Limehouse. It has been adopted by the\r\nLife-Boat Institution, and has stood the test of some years' experience\r\nwithout a single failure. In a trial lately made at Boulogne, the boat was\r\ntwice purposely capsized by the help of a crane, and righted herself in\r\ntwo seconds, and in less than fifteen seconds the water with which she was\r\nfilled disappeared through her self-acting valves. Of the entire number of\r\n1668 seamen saved during the last year, 399 owed their lives to these\r\nboats, and we have no doubt that in future years they will prove still\r\nmore effective, if only well handled and not rashly sailed by\r\ninexperienced men; for no life-boat can be devised that will not be liable\r\nto accidents if entrusted to careless or unskilful hands.\r\n\r\nBut there is another point almost equally important that seems to have\r\nbeen greatly overlooked, the worthlessness of the so-called life-boats\r\nthat every emigrant ship, every transport, every passenger vessel, is by\r\nAct of Parliament required to carry. We have no hesitation in pronouncing\r\nthem to be in most cases a mockery, a delusion, and a snare. It is not\r\nlong since that we heard from the lips of one of the most extensive\r\nboat-builders on the banks of the Thames, that, when a boat was condemned\r\nas unseaworthy for any other purpose, it was a common practice to patch it\r\nup, add a certain amount of air-case, and dispose of it as a life-boat. We\r\nknow not with whom it rests to see the Act enforced, whether with the\r\nBoard of Trade or the Life-boat Association, but the fact of its evasion\r\nis notorious, and a heavy responsibility rests somewhere. Even when the\r\ncrazy thing is embarked, it is often so stowed that it cannot be lowered\r\nin case of need without long delay, and is frequently deficient in sails,\r\noars, thole-pins, plugs, and always without an efficient compass. Yet in\r\nthis ill-equipped boat the lives of thirty, forty, perhaps fifty, of our\r\ntoo confiding countrymen are risked. It would be easy to see, before the\r\nvessel sailed, that the life-boat was efficient; that a certain supply of\r\nprovisions and fresh water was placed in proper cases; that the mast,\r\nsails, oars, and thole-pins were secured into the boat, and that an\r\nefficient boat-compass was provided, instead of the ridiculous toy that\r\ngoes by that name, the card of which spins round like a top at every\r\nstroke of the oars. The beautiful spirit or liquid boat-compass of Dent\r\nmay be purchased for less than £5. A life-boat thus furnished would give\r\nconfidence to the passengers, would serve them well in time of need, and\r\nwould be no more than the legislature is entitled to require under the\r\nprovisions of the Act. Anything less is a gross imposition upon the simple\r\nemigrants, who embark in confidence, believing that everything has been\r\ndone for their safety.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the life-boat system we have located in most of the\r\ncoast-guard stations rocket and mortar apparatus to enable a connection to\r\nbe established with stranded vessels by firing a rope over them. This\r\nmethod was effectual in 243 cases during the last year, and is well worked\r\nunder the auspices of the Board of Trade. The drawback to the use of the\r\nmortar apparatus is its weight, which prevents its being easily\r\ntransported along the rocky shores where it is chiefly needed, but we\r\nunderstand that Mr. Brown, of the General Register and Record Office of\r\nSeamen, has invented a portable apparatus, which will in all probability\r\ngreatly facilitate our means of communicating with stranded vessels, and\r\ntend in no small measure to still further lessen the dismal list of seamen\r\nwho annually perish on our weather-beaten coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLODGING, FOOD, AND DRESS OF SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the question had been asked a short time since what body of men\r\npresented the most healthy lives in her Majesty's dominions, the reply\r\nmight reasonably have been Her Majesty's Foot-Guards. Recruited, at the\r\nage of nineteen, principally from among the agricultural population,\r\nsubmitted to the critical examination of the inspecting surgeon, tried in\r\nwind and limb and tested at every point, the would-be soldier must be\r\nproved an athlete, or renounce for ever the hope of wearing her Majesty's\r\nuniform. Absorbed into the picked corps of the army; quartered either in\r\nmetropolitan barracks or within a stone's-throw of the palace of the\r\nSovereign; clothed, fed, housed, and tended in sickness by the State; and\r\nonly in the face of great emergencies required to brave the dangers of\r\nforeign service; the weak and incapable instantly weeded out from the\r\nranks,--his does indeed seem to be a select life, with which no other\r\namong the labouring classes would appear to be comparable. As we see him\r\non parade in all the pomp and panoply of war, we view him with pride as\r\nworthy of that noble band that swept irresistibly before it the eagles of\r\nFrance, and, single-handed, at Inkermann, long kept the foe at bay, and\r\nsaved two armies from destruction. Yet take the unhealthiest trades in\r\nEngland--the pallid tailor, as he sits at his board, or the miner who\r\nlives in the bowels of the earth--and it will be found that the percentage\r\nof deaths in their ranks is not nearly so great as in those of the\r\nmagnificent Guards, pipeclayed and polished up to meet the eye of princes,\r\nbut, alas! often little better than whited sepulchres. Such is the fact\r\nelicited by the labours of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into\r\nthe regulations affecting the sanitary condition of the army. If the \"most\r\nfavoured\" regiments furnish these disastrous results, it may be imagined\r\nthat the condition of the rank and file, who take their turn in all\r\nclimates, must be much worse; but, strange to say, the contrary is the\r\nfact. This is shown in the following table, which gives the number per\r\nthousand who die every year among the army at home and among the male\r\ncivilians of England and Wales at army ages:--\r\n\r\n  Household cavalry              11·0\r\n  Dragoon Guards and Dragoons    13·3\r\n  Foot Guards                    20·4\r\n  Infantry of the line           18·7\r\n\r\nPopulation of England and Wales, at army ages:--\r\n\r\n  Town and country population    9·2\r\n  Country alone                  7·7\r\n\r\nOne of the unhealthiest towns at army ages:--\r\n\r\n  Manchester    12·4\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Neison's calculation, the mortality of the Household\r\nCavalry is 1-4/5, Dragoons, &c., 2-1/5, Line 2-9/10, and Guards 3-1/13\r\ntimes as great as the mortality of the agricultural labourers who are\r\nmembers of friendly societies. Well may the Commissioners, contemplating\r\nthese returns, remark--\r\n\r\n    \"That in war men should die from exposure, from fatigue, from\r\n    insufficient supplies, is intelligible; or that the occupation of a\r\n    town of 30,000 inhabitants by an army of 30,000 men, without any\r\n    sanitary precaution, suddenly doubling the population to the area, and\r\n    thereby halving the proportion of every accommodation, supplies,\r\n    water, drainage, sewerage, &c. &c., should engender disease, is\r\n    readily understood; but the problem submitted to us is to find the\r\n    causes of a mortality more than double that of civil life among 60,000\r\n    men, scattered, in numbers seldom exceeding a thousand in one place,\r\n    among a population of 28,000,000, in time of profound peace, in a\r\n    country which is not only the healthiest, but which possesses the\r\n    greatest facility of communication and the greatest abundance of\r\n    supply in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to solve this extraordinary problem, the first question\r\nnaturally asked is, Why the foot soldiers suffer a rate of mortality so\r\nmuch higher than the cavalry? They are recruited pretty much from the\r\nsame source, and breathe apparently pretty much the same atmosphere; yet\r\nwe find that the Foot Guards perish at nearly double the rate of the Life\r\nGuards. The causes of this difference are mainly, overcrowding and the\r\nwant of due exercise and employment. The chief diseases of the soldier are\r\nfever and consumption; the latter, or \"the English Death,\" as it is but\r\ntoo aptly termed, being the chief destroyer. The deaths by pulmonary\r\ndisease amount in the cavalry to 7·3 per thousand, in the infantry of the\r\nline to 10·2, and in the Guards to 13·8; whilst of the entire number of\r\ndeaths from all causes in the army, diseases of the lungs constitute in\r\nthe cavalry 53·9 per cent., in the infantry of the line 57·277 per cent.,\r\nand in the Foot Guards 67·683 per cent. We are strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve that some portion of this extraordinary mortality from pulmonary\r\ndisease may be owing to the atmosphere of pipeclay in which the Foot\r\nGuards, and indeed the Horse Guards in a minor degree, live. In 1853, the\r\nyear in which the mortality tables were made up, the former pipe-clayed\r\ntheir white trousers and fatigue jackets as well as their belts. Thus the\r\nfine dust must have been for ever entering their lungs, and Mr. Simon, in\r\nhis recent Report affecting the health of special occupations, expressly\r\nstates that the workers in potteries are among the most unhealthy\r\nartisans, in consequence of the clay-dust they are constantly inhaling in\r\nthe course of their daily work affecting their respiratory organs.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that overcrowding is the chief cause of the disparity of\r\nthe death-rate between the two classes of Guards. If we compare the\r\nextremes, we find that, whilst the Foot Guards quartered in Portman-street\r\nbarracks have only 331 cubic feet of air allotted to each man, the Horse\r\nGuards at the Hyde Park barracks have 572 cubic feet; and if we take the\r\nwhole force of Foot and Horse Guards, we find that in London the latter\r\nhave the advantage of between one-fourth and one-fifth more air in their\r\nbarracks. But there is another and very important difference in favour of\r\nthe Horse Guard: his exercise is on the whole more varied than that of the\r\nFoot Guard. In the infantry, the drill only exercises the lower limbs and\r\nfixes the chest in one position; the grooming of a horse brings nearly\r\nevery muscle into play, which tends to open and expand the chest. The\r\nbroadsword exercise has the like effect. This diversity in the daily\r\nduties and in the amount of air they have to breathe, explains, we\r\nbelieve, the great discrepancy between the deaths from consumption of the\r\ntwo classes of Guards.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the increased mortality of the Dragoon regiments over that\r\nof the Life Guards is not so easy to discover. As regards the Line\r\nregiments, being quartered mostly in country localities, they breathe on\r\nthe whole a better atmosphere and have more exercise than the Foot Guards.\r\nThat this is the reason of their lower rate of mortality would appear from\r\nthe fact, that while the Guards were campaigning in Canada during the\r\nrebellion, enjoying the same pure air as the Line, and undergoing\r\nprecisely the same fatigue and exposure, their relative rate of mortality\r\nwas reversed, and the Foot Guards proved the more healthy of the two. The\r\nlatter portion of the Crimean campaign showed the same result.\r\n\r\nWhen the high rate of mortality was first made known in the \"Times,\"\r\nmilitary authorities imputed it chiefly to the destructive nature of the\r\nnight duties. The evidence given before the Commissioners, however,\r\nentirely negatives this explanation.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of men whose night duties are more severe than\r\nthose of the Foot Guards--firemen, the police, and sailors; yet, strange\r\nto say, all three enjoy a high state of health. The London fireman\r\nundergoes, perhaps, more wear and tear than the rest. His duties call him\r\nsometimes to several fires in a night, and when not out he is waiting in\r\nreadiness. Whilst on service he is liable to great varieties of\r\ntemperature, and to a good deal of wet; one minute he is scorching in the\r\nmidst of the fire, the next half-drowned by the water. Nevertheless, he\r\nsuffers a mortality of only seven per thousand. The metropolitan police\r\nare on duty ten consecutive hours in all weather, yet their mortality is\r\nless than nine per thousand. The comparison between them and the Foot\r\nGuards is the closest that could be made, as the unmarried men all live in\r\nsection-houses (or barracks), are clothed in a uniform, and fed in messes.\r\nYet the mortality is just half that of the line regiments, and less than\r\nhalf the mortality of the Foot Guards! The sailor on the home station, who\r\nis worse lodged than either, and is subject to constant nightwork of a\r\nvery exposed character, shows a still more favourable result. It is clear\r\ntherefore that the nightwork will not account for the frightful inroads\r\nmade by disease in the ranks of the soldier. Nor need we go much further\r\nthan the barracks to know the main causes of all this suffering and death.\r\nIn London, as we have said, no more than 331 cubic feet of air was meted\r\nout to her Majesty's Foot Guards, and in Dover Castle it was reduced to\r\n147 feet per man, or less than the quantity which brought about the jail\r\nfever which Howard discovered to be raging in the Cambridge Town Bridewell\r\nin 1774. The highest average space allotted to each man before 1847 was\r\n447 cubic feet. Even this amount of air is rendered less pure by defective\r\narrangements. Add to which the beds are placed only one foot apart, in\r\ndefiance of the fact that a man may be suffocated in a crowd\r\nnotwithstanding that he has all the sky above him. The state of the\r\nmorning atmosphere is thus summed up by Serjeant Brown, in answer to the\r\nquestions from one of the Commissioners:--\r\n\r\n    \"Have you often gone into the men's rooms in the morning before the\r\n    windows were open?--Yes. In what state did you find the\r\n    atmosphere?--In a very thick and nasty state, especially if I came in\r\n    out of the air. If I went in out of my own room sometimes, I could not\r\n    bear it till I had ordered the windows to be opened to make a draught.\r\n    I have often retired to the passage and called to the orderly man to\r\n    open the windows.\"\r\n\r\nIn some cases the troops are lodged in the basement of buildings below the\r\nnatural level of the soil, or in places where the storekeepers object to\r\nput their stores, in consequence of the damage that would result to them\r\nfrom the damp. A notable instance is given in evidence by Dr. T. E.\r\nBalfour:--\r\n\r\n    \"In 1845 the armoury was burnt down in the Tower, and a new barrack\r\n    was erected on its site--certainly not before it was wanted, because\r\n    the accommodation was very bad. The barrack was finished in the\r\n    beginning of 1849; fever was then prevailing among the men, and\r\n    cholera threatening. The surgeon applied to have the new barracks\r\n    given over for the use of the men, and he got two rooms; he\r\n    remonstrated through his commanding officer with the authorities, when\r\n    he was informed that he could not have more given over to him, as they\r\n    were full of stores--blankets, I believe. On suggesting that the\r\n    stores might be put into the old barracks, he was told that they were\r\n    a great deal too damp to put stores into, and it was only in\r\n    consequence of an energetic remonstrance on the part of the commanding\r\n    officer, which I believe reached the Duke of Wellington, that a Board\r\n    of officers was ordered to assemble, who recommended that the troops\r\n    should be immediately moved into the new barracks.\"\r\n\r\nNow and then the crotchet of a Colonel does a vast deal of mischief. Not\r\nmany years since, the cavalry at Knightsbridge were condemned to drink the\r\nwater from the Serpentine,--a reservoir of filth, which is now pronounced\r\nto be pestilential to the neighbourhood. The men objected to use this\r\ndiluted sewage; but the commanding-officer had perfect faith in filters.\r\nNevertheless, the water persisted in smelling bad, notwithstanding it\r\nlooked clear,--a mystery the Colonel's knowledge of chemistry could not\r\nfathom; nor would he give in until a Board had been called. The veterinary\r\nsurgeon now began to complain that the coats of the horses were beginning\r\nto stare, and he wished that they should drink from the improved supply\r\nwhich was furnished to the men. The Colonel still had faith in his\r\nSerpentine water, and maintained that the horses would prefer it to the\r\npurer stream. A bucket of each was placed side by side in the\r\nbarrack-yard, and a horse was brought in, which immediately settled the\r\nquestion by refusing the dirty water, and plunging its muzzle into the\r\nclean. It is not many years since the troops stationed at the Tower were,\r\nin like manner, forced to drink the Thames water, taken from the most\r\nconvenient, which chanced to be the foulest, spot in the whole river. A\r\ncoarse filter did not suffice to protect them from the disease such\r\nsupplies were sure to engender.\r\n\r\nThey manage these things better now in civil life. In the year 1848, the\r\nSociety for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes opened their\r\nfirst model lodging-house. Their measure of the quantity of air necessary\r\nfor the poor man was much greater than that settled three years later, by\r\nthe military authorities, for the soldier. The mechanic and labourer were\r\nallowed 542 cubic feet; the soldier, under the most favourable conditions,\r\nbreathed no more than from 400 to 500 cubic feet,--a measure which fines\r\noff, by degrees, to the Black Hole allowance at Dover Castle, where the\r\nsoldier was reduced to 131 cubic inches. Nor is this the only point in\r\nfavour of the model lodging-house, of which there are several situated in\r\nthe foulest portions of the metropolis, and which accommodate sometimes\r\nseven hundred inmates, or the full strength of many a regiment. Besides\r\ncontaining pure air, which, with a proper system of ventilation, costs\r\nnothing, but is of incalculable value to human life, the lodging-house,\r\ninstead of being confined to one room, used for all purposes, is divided\r\ninto the ordinary apartments of an inn; every inmate has his own\r\ndormitory, and there is a good coffee-room stored with papers and books,\r\nand supplied with hot water. In the kitchen below, there are facilities\r\nfor roasting, boiling, baking, and frying, and each man has his safe for\r\nprovisions. Hot and cold baths are provided; and the whole building is\r\nheated by hot-water pipes, and well lighted by gas. If the soldier was\r\ntreated like his brother of the chisel and the hammer, the mortality of\r\nthe Guards would not be at the rate of 20·4, and that of the ordinary rank\r\nand file at the rate of 17·8 per thousand, whilst that of the mechanic is\r\nonly 13·9 per thousand.\r\n\r\nIf we were to write volumes, we could not deepen the impression these\r\nfigures are calculated to convey of the importance to health of sanitary\r\nscience. It has been said that soldiers would not appreciate the benefits\r\nof a model lodging-house, and that, as the colonel asserted of the\r\ntroop-horse, they prefer the dirty to the clean,--crowding in a common\r\nroom, to separate apartments. If this were true, it would be no reason for\r\nnot teaching them better. If bad habits are congenial to them, they do not\r\nsuffer less when the mischief is done; and if they were callous to the\r\nlast, the interest of the nation still requires that lives which cost so\r\nmuch should not be recklessly thrown away. But experience refutes the\r\nsupposition that soldiers have different notions of comfort from\r\ncivilians. The Guards, in the old part of the Wellington Barracks, had,\r\non one occasion, the temporary use, as a day-room, of an apartment fifty\r\nfeet by thirty, and, large as it was, it became inconveniently crowded.\r\nThe Commissioners, in their report, recommend that a minimum space of 600\r\nfeet be allotted to each man in his barrack and guard-room, that an\r\ninterval of at least three feet be maintained between each bed, and that a\r\nday-room should be provided. The barrack should at least be on a par with\r\nthe workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe high rate of mortality in the army is not to be attributed to the bad\r\narrangements of barracks alone; the important elements of exercise and\r\nfood have to be considered, and in both the infantry are in an inferior\r\nposition to the artisan.\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps,\" says Colonel Lindsay, \"no living individual suffers more\r\n    than the soldier from _ennui_. He has no employment save the drill and\r\n    its duties; these are of a most monotonous and uninteresting\r\n    description, so much so that you cannot increase their amount without\r\n    wearying and disgusting him. All he has to do is under restraint; he\r\n    is not like a working man or an artisan; a working man will dig, and\r\n    his mind is his own; an artisan is interested in the work on which he\r\n    is engaged: but a soldier has to give you all his attention, and he\r\n    has nothing to show for the work done. He gets up at six; there is no\r\n    drill before breakfast; he makes up his bed and cleans up his things:\r\n    he gets his breakfast at seven; he turns out for drill at half-past\r\n    seven or eight; his drill may last half an hour. If it be guard-day\r\n    there is no drill except for defaulters. The men for duty are paraded\r\n    at ten o'clock; that finishes his day-drill altogether. There is\r\n    evening parade, which takes half an hour, and then his time is his own\r\n    until tattoo, which is at nine in winter and ten in summer. That is\r\n    the day of a soldier not on guard or not belonging to a company which\r\n    is out for Minié practice.\"\r\n\r\nUnless it be denied that the mind has any influence over the body, it\r\ncannot be doubted that the inaction to which the infantry soldier is\r\nsubjected in barracks, by the regulations of the service, is most\r\ndetrimental to his mental activity and bodily health. The actuary well\r\nknows that the affluent upper classes, although in every other respect\r\nplaced in the best sanitary condition, are shorter lived than the\r\nagricultural labourer, for the simple reason that, having but little\r\nactive duty to perform, they suffer from _ennui_, which begets\r\ndissipation. The soldier shares with the wealthy this cause of increased\r\nmortality, without sharing in their other favourable conditions. Idle and\r\nill-lodged, he naturally resorts to the public-house, and, having but\r\nlittle money to procure drink, he too often degrades himself by sponging\r\nupon the female admirers of red coats for the means. The annals of the\r\npolice-courts are but too rife with the records of crimes and\r\nmisdemeanours committed by the Foot-Guards from these causes. Mr.\r\nJeffreys, a high authority, testifies that in India a large proportion of\r\nthe men chafe and drink themselves to death, under modes of life so\r\nopposed to the habits of out-door labour in which they have been reared.\r\nThe soldier is not so much in fault as the rule of the service which\r\nprecludes him from making himself useful. The best-conducted troops are\r\nthe Engineers, who work at their different trades. The evil does not stop\r\nwith the mischief which the idle are sure to perpetrate. The active,\r\nself-reliant Englishman is notoriously the most dependant soldier in\r\nEurope. He can neither cook, bake, make his clothes, nor hut himself, like\r\nthe Frenchman, the Sardinian, or even the Turk. Contractors follow him\r\neverywhere, excepting into the presence of the enemy; and when he most\r\nneeds every necessary of life he finds himself a helpless man. Mr. J. R.\r\nMartin, one of the Commissioners, who has passed a life in high posts as a\r\nmilitary surgeon in India, and who has done more for the sanitary\r\ncondition of the soldier than any living person, holds it as a principle,\r\n\"that in all climates the soldier should do for himself whatever he can\r\nperform without injury to his health, morals, or discipline; and, further,\r\nthat he should be required to do whatever may be essential to his\r\nserviceable condition, in the event of a failure of the appointed\r\nappliances. Before the soldier can be held as fit to undertake his duties\r\nto the State, he must be made capable of maintaining everything which may\r\nbe necessary to his personal care and comfort.\" Does Aldershott or\r\nShorncliffe fulfil even the majority of the conditions calculated to train\r\nthe soldier for active service? Is he taught to build his own hut, to dig\r\nhis own well, to make his own roads, to cook his own victuals, or to mend\r\nhis own clothes? Aldershott, in fact, is not a camp at all, but a city of\r\nsoldiers, built and maintained \"by contract;\" the sum expended on the\r\nbuildings alone, for the years 1854 to 1856, being no less than\r\n486,502_l._ 13s. 6d.; and we have little doubt that up to the present\r\ntime, the civil labour has cost more than 600,000_l._[30] Now, as Colonel\r\nTulloch urged, before these barracks were erected, why should not the men\r\nhut themselves? There are clay, gravel, and sand, on the spot, with\r\nabundance of small wood that no one will buy, not more than eight miles\r\ndistant. Soldiers have hutted themselves at Maroon Town, in the West\r\nIndies, at 25_l._ per head. The buildings would not be such permanent\r\nstructures as the contractors have put together: we should miss the\r\narchitectural façades for the officers' quarters, and the \"moulded\r\ncornices\" so maliciously described by the _Times'_ correspondent; but we\r\nshould have serviceable huts which would last for eight or ten years.\r\nThere can be little doubt that the men would be healthier in them than in\r\nvast barracks. The process of building would supply the kind of exercise\r\nwhich would amuse as well as instruct, and the plan would certainly save\r\nmoney to the State. Considerably more than one half, or 647·9 per\r\nthousand, of our soldiers have been recruited from the agricultural\r\npopulation, to whom the erection of earthworks and building of all kinds\r\nwould be somewhat familiar. Of the remaining number, 294·7 have been\r\ntrained to mechanical trades. Surely, from this force handicraftsmen could\r\nbe selected to perform much of the work of the army. Bakers, cooks,\r\ntailors, and bootmakers, could be found to supply the wants of the\r\nregiment, and relieve us from the incubus of government contractors. We\r\nplace more confidence in a system in which the artisan-soldier will reap\r\nthe fruits of his labour, than in athletic games, which are not to be\r\nneglected, but which become irksome when they are enjoined upon the\r\nsoldier by regulation. Serious exertion, too, with a useful result, is\r\nalways more invigorating in the long run than exertion which leaves no\r\nresult at all. Work, in short, within reasonable limits, is more healthful\r\nthan play.\r\n\r\nDuring the disastrous months of the Crimean campaign, Mr. Galton proposed\r\nto give a series of lectures to the reinforcements about to proceed to the\r\nseat of war, on the shifts available in wild countries. He went to the\r\nMuseum of the United Service Club at the hour he had advertised, but as\r\nhis audience amounted to but one soldier, he discontinued his efforts to\r\nmake known those _wrinkles_ he had acquired with so much suffering\r\nhimself. The substance of these intended lectures he has since amplified\r\ninto a book, which is one of the most interesting little volumes we ever\r\nread, and which should be in the hands of every campaigner, whether\r\nmilitary or otherwise. Had our soldiers been acquainted with its contents\r\nwhen our commissariat broke down, they would have been able to lighten\r\ntheir miseries in a considerable degree. The services which he extracts\r\nfrom a single piece of stick are almost inconceivable; and when there\r\nseems to be no further hope, he shows how the difficulties may often be\r\novercome by the aid of the very circumstances which appeared to have\r\ncaused the breakdown. His makeshifts and expedients are, it is true, at\r\ntimes rather rough; and Ensign Firebrass, as he looks at his\r\nneatly-polished little boot, would perhaps be startled at being told, that\r\non a march, \"pieces of linen a foot square, smeared with grease, and\r\nnicely folded over the foot cornerwise,\" form a capital substitute for\r\nsocks; or that breaking \"a raw egg into a hard boot before putting it on\r\ngreatly softens the leather.\" Such announcements may be horrifying in the\r\nmidst of luxury, but in hard circumstances the most nicely got up London\r\ndandy would be grateful for the hint. Many a poor soldier, at any rate,\r\nwould be glad to know that even on a plain where there is nothing except\r\nthe turf beneath his feet, protection is at hand if he were aware how to\r\navail himself of it. \"He need only turn up a broad sod seven feet long by\r\ntwo wide, and if he succeeds in propping it up on its edge, it will form a\r\nsufficient shield against the wind,\" and even against a drifting rain,\r\nprovided he plants his turf between the weather and himself.\r\n\r\nAs regards the in-door amusements of the soldier, we have but little\r\nbelief in regimental libraries. The recruit from the agricultural\r\ndistricts will not read such volumes as generally form the bulk of these\r\ncollections. A Scotch sergeant or two will thumb over Rollin's \"Ancient\r\nHistory,\" or Robertson's \"History of Scotland,\" but the majority of the\r\nsoldiers will not look at them. \"I have never heard of a reading army,\"\r\nsaid the late Dr. William Fergusson; and we agree with him as far as what\r\nare called standard works are concerned. The soldier can be amused,\r\nhowever, with a lighter class of literature, and there is a certainty of\r\npleasing him with a newspaper. This is the reading he selects for himself\r\nin the public-house, and why not condescend to consult his tastes?\r\nMajor-General Lawrance stated that the system had been tried in some\r\ngarrisons with excellent effect, of providing a room where the men could\r\nprocure papers, coffee, and a pipe. \"We approach the soldier,\" says Robert\r\nJackson, \"with the dram-bottle in one hand, and the lash in the other.\"\r\nThings are not so bad as in his day, but the temptation and the punishment\r\nare still provided; and to reduce both as much as possible, we should\r\nemploy pleasant preventives, both of a moral and physical kind.\r\n\r\nThe question of food is intimately connected with the health of the\r\nsoldier, and, as far as we can see, no attempt has been made by the\r\ncommissariat to adjust it satisfactorily to the varying conditions to\r\nwhich he is subjected. The truck system, which has long been abolished by\r\nlaw in the payment of workmen, is still maintained to some extent in the\r\narmy. The soldier is nominally paid 13_d._ per day, but out of this the\r\nauthorities stop a certain sum, which varies with the markets, for the\r\nrations and other necessaries supplied to him. The quantity of the ration\r\nis fixed both for service at home and abroad. At home he has 1 lb. of\r\nbread and 3/4 lb. of meat inclusive of bone, an additional 1/2 lb. of\r\nbread being given to troops encamped in England. Abroad the ration\r\nconsists of 1 lb. of bread or 3/4 lb. of biscuit, and 1 lb. of meat either\r\nsalt or fresh, the additional 1/4 lb. being given to compensate for the\r\ninferior quality of foreign compared to English meat. There are one or two\r\nexceptional rations; but at home or abroad, in peace or in war, the ration\r\n(the quality of the meat being considered) is the same. Simplicity may be\r\nurged in favour of the system, but we fear this is its only merit, and we\r\nare not at all surprised to find the following remarks in the Report:--\"We\r\nare of opinion that no ration can be fixed upon which shall be adhered to\r\nin both peace and war. The conditions of life are so different in the two\r\ncases, that whatever is suitable for the one must be either too much or\r\ntoo little for the other.\" Common sense would clearly point out that the\r\nration which would be amply sufficient for the soldier in country\r\nquarters, whose principal occupation is lounging along the street, or\r\nleaning upon a bridge, would go but little way to maintain the wear and\r\ntear of a man when exhausted by the fatigues of an active campaign. The\r\ndegree and nature of his labours then may be gathered from the following\r\nextract from the Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the Supplies\r\nof the Army in the East:--\r\n\r\n    \"The average weight carried by a soldier on the march, including food\r\n    and water for the day, is probably not less than from fifty to sixty\r\n    pounds, and while carrying that burden he is frequently required not\r\n    only to march considerable distances, but also to move rapidly, and\r\n    make other great exertions. In the ordinary course of his duty he is\r\n    called upon to watch during the night at longer or shorter intervals,\r\n    whatever may have been his previous exertions. He is exposed to every\r\n    vicissitude of temperature, and often to the inclemency of the\r\n    weather, by night as well as by day, and must be ready to turn out\r\n    when required, at any hour, and under any circumstances. He must\r\n    generally be content with the shelter of a tent, whatever the climate\r\n    may be. When engaged in siege operations, he has to perform, mostly\r\n    during the night, the work that a railway labourer performs by\r\n    day--excavating and removing earth. When stores are to be landed, he\r\n    is often required to do the work of a dockyard labourer. When employed\r\n    in active service the soldier, therefore, requires a diet as\r\n    nourishing as that which is requisite to maintain the physical powers\r\n    of any other man engaged in hard labour involving frequent watching\r\n    and exposure.\"\r\n\r\nThat is, the soldier is required at times to be a railway navvy, and\r\nsomething more; but, unlike the navvy, he is not allowed to replenish his\r\ninward man according to his natural desires, but according to a certain\r\nfixed regulation. As well may a stoker limit his engine to a hundredweight\r\nof coals a day, and expect to get any speed out of it he pleased. The\r\nnavigator, whilst executing heavy work, is known to eat as much as six\r\npounds of meat a day. Now we question if any navigator ever worked harder\r\nthan the common soldier in the trenches before Sebastopol, yet he was\r\nexpected to perform his task on one pound of meat, fresh or _salt_, equal\r\nto three-quarters of a pound of English beef or mutton. The salt meat too\r\nis vastly less nutritive than fresh; and in case the lemon-juice fails, as\r\nit did in the Crimea, scurvy and its allied diseases are sure to follow\r\nits use. Well may Dr. Christison have remarked \"that any scientific person\r\nconversant with the present subject (dietaries) could have foretold, as a\r\ncertain consequence, sooner or later, of their duty, that the British\r\ntroops would fall into the calamitous state which befell them in the\r\nCrimea.\" It must be evident again that the soldier during a Canadian\r\nwinter requires more meat than he does between the tropics. In cold\r\nclimates the nitrogenous and carboniferous food should predominate; in\r\nwarm climates a larger amount of vegetable food is required. The exact\r\namount of the different kinds of food, however, requires a special study;\r\nbut surely chemistry, which has so admirably catered for the varying wants\r\nof prisoners undergoing fluctuating amounts of exertion, could find no\r\ndifficulty in furnishing proper dietary tables for the British army in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe. The Commissioners, in their Report, fully\r\nconvinced of the injustice even at home of keeping stalwart English\r\nsoldiers upon half a pound of meat per day, recommend that it shall be\r\nincreased to a pound.\r\n\r\nIn the clothing of the British soldier a contest has been long going on\r\nbetween what is considered by the officers to look \"smart,\" and what is\r\nfound by the men to be comfortable. A soldier upon parade and a soldier\r\ngoing into action scarcely looks the same man. The tight coat, the stiff\r\nstock, and the ugly shako, give a stiffness to his figure which is termed\r\n\"a soldierly appearance:\" but upon the march or the eve of battle the\r\njacket is thrown open, the trowsers are tucked up, the shako is thrown\r\naway, and the stock follows suit. He has divested himself of every\r\nparticle of clothing which is supposed to conduce to his smartness; but\r\nhe is a free man: he can use his limbs with facility, he can march without\r\nfainting, and he can fight at his ease. Major-General Lawrance,\r\napologising for the retention of the shako, and for the leathern stock,\r\nupon home service, urges that \"it is essential to consider the appearance\r\nas well as the comfort of the soldier.\" Some of the soldiers themselves\r\nwish to keep the stock, provided \"that it may always be taken off when\r\nmuscular exertion is required.\" The Commissioners are of opinion, and we\r\nthink rightly, that \"this condition applied to any part of a soldier's\r\ndress is condemnatory of it.\" Why should he possess a set of fine weather\r\nfeathers any more than the fireman or the policeman? Fitness is the very\r\nessence of comeliness. The Ironsides of Cromwell would have smiled grimly\r\nat the holiday suit of the modern soldier. The Commissioners in their\r\nReport condemn nearly every article of clothing in present use--the stock\r\nas an instrument of strangulation; the shako as neither fitted by size,\r\ncolour, weight, material, nor form, for service in hot climates; and the\r\ntrowsers as gathering dust on the march. In the Crimea the men were in the\r\nhabit of wrapping a piece of bale canvas from the commissariat stores\r\nround their legs, which effectually protected them from the mud and wet.\r\nThis suggests a return to the old gaiter used in the army during the early\r\npart of George III.'s reign, and still by some regiments of Highlanders,\r\nor the adoption of a boot to lace over the bottom of the trowsers like the\r\nordinary shooting boot. The West India regiments are ordered to wear the\r\nZouave dress--the loose trowsers, leather leggings, jacket, and fez. This\r\nmay be well enough adapted for black troops, but we should be sorry to see\r\nour own men tricked out in this foreign fashion.\r\n\r\nThe chief parts of the soldier's body which require attention, as regards\r\nhealth, are the head and neck. The head should be protected against the\r\nextremes of heat and cold by every means that science can devise. In\r\ntropical climates we still retain the shako, shielding it from the sun\r\nwith a linen cover. The insufficiency of this device is read in the\r\nfearful mortality from sun-stroke, which devastates our army in India at\r\nthe present time. The natives wear a cotton turban with an old horseshoe\r\non the top to protect them from sword-cuts; and the Commissioners\r\nrecommend a light cap covered with wadded linen, with a flap hanging down\r\nbehind. Like the sola or pith helmet, the protection here is in the slow\r\nconducting power of the material. Mr. Jeffreys, however, in his admirable\r\ntreatise entitled \"The British Army in India,\" justly remarks, that the\r\nslower a substance conducts, the longer it retains its heat. A\r\nturban-covered shako worn all day in an Indian sun becomes charged with\r\ncaloric to such an extent that it will give out a sensible heat when hung\r\nup in the tent, and will distress the head the moment it is put on; for\r\nthis reason the covering should be placed outside the tent at night to\r\ncool. But, after all, though the heat may penetrate very slowly to the\r\nwearer, the time comes when at last it reaches the skull. The protection\r\nmay be ample for the acclimatised Hindoo, and yet be insufficient for the\r\nEuropean. Mr. Jeffreys tells us that the scarf-skin of the Indian is so\r\nmuch thicker than that of the European, that, when serving as a medical\r\nofficer, he was obliged to have a lancet ground in a peculiar manner for\r\nvaccinating the horny hide of the native infants. We therefore agree with\r\nhim that science must be called upon to give the English soldier a still\r\nfurther defence against the sun. He has himself attempted to solve the\r\nproblem. Instead of the use of the cloth-covered helmets he terms\r\nsun-traps he has constructed an ingenious covering in which reflection,\r\nretarded conduction, slow radiation, convection, and ventilation are\r\nbrought consecutively into play. There can be little doubt that\r\nscientifically his contrivance is unexceptionable, and would keep the head\r\nalways cool. The weight, however, which his plan necessitates is a\r\nmaterial element, although it is the heat not the weight which kills. If\r\nwe desire to form an idea of the amount of heat which is thrown off by a\r\nbright surface, we have only to place our hands before the polished sides\r\nof a common firegrate, when the reflected heat will be found to be very\r\nlittle less than that directly radiated from the fire. It is just because\r\nthese sides cast the heat which strikes them back again that the inner\r\nface is kept comparatively cool. This, therefore, is the best description\r\nof surface to present to the sky. It may be objected that the soldiers\r\nwould be dazzled by the helmets of their comrades; but the inconvenience\r\nwould only be incident to a curvilinear-shaped helmet, possessing numerous\r\ntangential planes of reflection. A rectangular form, such as that of the\r\npresent shako, would reflect the rays of the midday sun either down to the\r\nearth or up to the sky, and there would be no more glare observable than\r\nfrom the windows of a house, which, except at sunset, are the darkest part\r\nof the building. The helmet of the crusader was made in the form of a tin\r\npot: this was retained by the Knights Templars, who well understood the\r\nvalue of the bright reflecting surface and the rectangular shape.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffreys goes further. He proposes that the body-dress of soldiers\r\nserving in tropical climates should also have a metallic reflecting\r\nsurface. Though the idea may seem strange, we think it worthy of\r\nconsideration. A good defence against tropical heat must be devised if we\r\nintend to keep India; for we cannot afford to send English regiments to be\r\nwholly destroyed as fighting men every ten years. The sun is the great\r\nally of the natives; they counted upon its service in the late rebellion,\r\nand we must endeavour to convert this enemy into a friend. A perfectly\r\nsun-proof dress would be worth many armies to us. Some regiments of\r\nirregular horse, which are by far the most picturesque-looking troops we\r\nhave, wear a light gray woollen blouse with simple curb chains on the\r\nshoulders to protect them from sword-cuts. This we believe to be the most\r\nsuitable garment at present in use. Mr. Galton says that \"during the\r\nprogress of expeditions notes have been made of the number in them of\r\nthose who have provided themselves with flannel, and of those who have\r\nnot, and the list of sick always included names from the latter list in a\r\nvery great proportion.\" With a host of such facts, well known to all who\r\nhave paid attention to the subject, it seems surprising that the military\r\nauthorities should have adopted a linen blouse for the troops in India.\r\nThis material is perhaps the best conductor of all the fabrics used in\r\ndress; its unsuitableness therefore for a climate which is alternately\r\nhot, cold, and wet, may easily be imagined. The neck and spine should be\r\nguarded against the assaults of the sun almost as carefully as the head.\r\nIn all ages Easterns have been mindful to protect the great nervous\r\nhighway. The Arabs invariably bring one of the ends of the turban down\r\nover the neck, and the French have adopted the same plan in Algeria. As\r\nregards the spine, every one has experienced the sense of sickness which\r\nis produced when the back is brought close to a strong fire. Such a fire\r\nthe poor soldier often endures for hours when marching under an Indian\r\nsun. Sun-strokes arise as much from this cause as from the exposure of the\r\nhead. The Arab has a long tasselled loop of cloth hanging down in the\r\nsmall of the back, which acts as a piece of solar armour: the English\r\nsoldier should have a similar protection, unless we are to consider that\r\nhis black knapsack and his neatly rolled great-coat are all that is\r\nrequired. A belt of flannel should by no means be forgotten. The direct\r\nrays of the sun striking upon the expanse of nerves over the abdomen often\r\nbring on cholera or dysentery. The soldier should have, in addition, a\r\nloose woollen wrapper to serve as a change when campaigning. The value of\r\ndry clothes when he lies down on the bare ground after a fatiguing march\r\nis not to be overrated. \"The skin's debility is malaria's opportunity,\"\r\njustly remarks Mr. Jeffreys. \"The germs of fever, dysentery, and cholera,\r\nstalking over the bodies of a sleeping army, which has been exposed to the\r\nsun by day, quickly scent out the enfeebled skins and divide the prey!\"\r\n\r\nThe colour of the dress is important. Dr. Coulier, who has lately\r\ninvestigated the qualities of different materials as clothing for troops,\r\nfound that white cotton placed over a cloth dress produced a fall of 7\r\ndegrees per cent. in heat. When the tube of a thermometer was covered with\r\ncotton sheeting and placed in the sun, it marked 35·1, with cotton lining\r\n35·5, with unbleached linen 39·6, with dark blue cloth 42, with red cloth\r\n42. From these experiments it will be seen that the staring red of our\r\nuniforms absorbs no less than seven degrees more of heat than simple\r\ncotton. As we have to guard against the cold of night, and the damp of the\r\nrainy season, perhaps the best method of meeting the varied conditions of\r\nheat, moisture, and cold would be to give the soldier a simple woollen\r\nblouse of some neutral colour, which, while it did not absorb the sun's\r\nrays, would yet be pleasing to the eye. Gray, faced with red, or girdled\r\nwith a red sash or belt, would have an excellent effect, and would answer\r\nadmirably.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that whilst our troops at home, for the last twenty years\r\nwithin the immediate influence of a growing sanitary science, have\r\nprofited little by its teaching, the troops quartered abroad within the\r\nsame time have experienced a marked decline in their annual rate of\r\nmortality. In the year 1835 Lord Howick caused a parliamentary inquiry to\r\nbe made into the causes of the fearful mortality among the troops on some\r\nof the foreign stations, especially in the West Indian islands. The\r\nreturns proved even worse than had been anticipated. The mortality in\r\nJamaica was no less than 128 per thousand, or, in other words, every\r\neighth man who stepped on board a transport for service in this beautiful\r\nisland was doomed to leave his body for the land crabs. In the other\r\nislands the mortality was somewhat less, the deaths being 81 in the\r\nthousand. The reason of this decimation had long been known. More than\r\nfifty years ago Robert Jackson had pointed out the deadly nature of our\r\nmilitary posts, situated for the most part at the embouchures of rivers\r\nand in low harbours, or placed in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\npestiferous swamps. Salt pork and rum were called in to finish the work\r\nmalaria had commenced. Five days a-week were our soldiers rationed upon\r\nthis poisonous food; and, to make the injustice more glaring, the convicts\r\nupon the island were fed with fresh meat, and were consequently in good\r\nhealth. In 1843 Sir Charles Metcalfe determined that the troops should no\r\nlonger perish. He altered their diet and removed them entirely from the\r\nmarshy plains to Maroon Town, which stands at an elevation of not more\r\nthan 2,500 feet on the Blue Mountains, but sufficient to lift European\r\nlife above the level of the deadly fevers of the climate. The effect of\r\nthese changes exactly corresponded with what had been foretold by Jackson;\r\nthe mortality speedily fell from 128 to 60 per thousand, and is now\r\nreduced to 32. Thus for many generations the mortality of white troops in\r\nJamaica was fourfold what it should have been, through ignorance and\r\nextravagance; for, strange to say, the difference between the cost of the\r\npoisonous salt pork and the healthy fresh meat caused a saving to the\r\nGovernment of 80,000_l._ a-year.\r\n\r\nIn other colonies the improvement in the health of the troops has been\r\nmarked of late years. At Ceylon, where resort has been had to\r\nhill-stations, the mortality has decreased from 74 per thousand,--at which\r\nratio it stood until 1836,--to 38 per thousand at the present time. During\r\nthe same period, we find that at St. Helena the rate has fallen from 25 to\r\n12, at Gibraltar from 22 to 12, at the Ionian islands from 27 to 17, and\r\nat Newfoundland from 37 to 11 per thousand. From this gratifying statement\r\nwe must except the greatest dependency of all,--our Indian Empire. In\r\nBengal the mortality of the British soldier, just before the mutiny, was\r\neven greater than it had been twenty years before. On the average of\r\nnineteen years previous to 1836, it had been 75 per thousand; on the\r\naverage of the next period of eighteen years, it was 76 per thousand. In\r\nBombay, the mortality has decreased 2 per thousand; but in Madras the\r\nimprovement has been such that the deaths have fallen from 76 to 41 per\r\nthousand. Whilst India remained in the hands of the East India Company,\r\nand the British troops stationed there seldom exceeded 25,000, the high\r\nmortality of the presidency of Bengal might have escaped observation; but\r\nnow that the European soldiers are more than doubled, the necessity for\r\nputting their sanitary condition upon a proper footing must be obvious.\r\n\"Colonel Tulloch has informed me,\" says Mr. Martin, in his admirable work\r\non the Influence of Tropical Climates on the European Constitution, \"that\r\nbetween 1815 and 1855 there died, of European soldiers belonging to her\r\nMajesty's and the East India Company's army in India, very nearly 100,000\r\nmen, the greater portion of whose lives might have been saved, had better\r\nlocalities been selected for military occupation in that country.\"\r\nEstimating the value of each soldier in India at 100_l._, this would give\r\na sum of 10,000,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe barracks and cantonments of India, as regard vastness and solidity,\r\nare, perhaps, not to be equalled by any in the world. The military\r\nbuildings of Burhampore, in Bengal, are said to have cost, during the\r\nseventy-seven years they were in existence, including capital and\r\ninterest, 16,891,206_l._; yet this costly station, like that of\r\nSecunderabad, in the Madras presidency, was planted in an absolutely\r\npestiferous locality. All over India the localities of the barracks are\r\nbad, and their construction and arrangement extremely faulty. \"Nearly the\r\nwhole station of Cawnpore,\" says Mr. Jeffreys, \"running some miles along\r\nthe river, was so cut up into small 'compounds,' by high mud walls, that a\r\nbird's-eye view would have given it the appearance of a divided\r\nhoney-comb. These walls, with the profusion of trees they enclosed, seemed\r\nas if designed to cut off every current of wind from the inhabitants of\r\nthe ground-floor dwellings hidden within them.\" In another case, as if to\r\nmake stagnation doubly secure, he mentions that there is a square wall\r\nwithin a square wall, surrounding a cantonment. Hence we can easily\r\naccount for the fearful mortality among European troops in India. As if to\r\nmake patent to us the folly we commit in constructing these vast\r\nbakehouses, the native troops, who hut themselves outside our lines, and\r\nthus get plenty of air, present the unique example of a soldiery whose\r\nmortality is below that of the population from which it is recruited. In\r\nthe Bengal presidency the mutiny has cleared away the difficulty; for it\r\nhas swept the mass of these pestilential cantonments from the face of the\r\nearth. The question, how shall we profit by the loss? is answered by Mr.\r\nMartin in his \"Suggestions for promoting the Health and Efficiency of the\r\nBritish Troops serving in the East Indies.\" He insists that we must\r\nstation our troops, in future, upon the hills, but not on such stations as\r\nwe have on the Himalaya and Neilgherry mountains,--positions of 7,000 feet\r\nabove the sea; for, although they are a security against the fevers of the\r\ncountry, they are apt to induce bowel complaints, which are almost as\r\nfatal. His opinion is, that elevations of from 2,800 to 6,000 feet would\r\nyield a climate most congenial for European troops,--such, in fact, as we\r\nhave already found in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. He especially draws\r\nattention to the solitary hills,--\"those islands of the plains,\"--as\r\ncapable of affording a refuge from the fevers that inundate the low-lying\r\nground. Here the mass of the British army may be lodged until their\r\nservices are needed. From these eyries, like the Romans of old, they may\r\nwatch the champaign country, and be ready, at a moment's notice, to move\r\non any threatened position. There is no intention of recommending the\r\nabandonment of strategical points, or large cities which serve as\r\narsenals, simply because they are not wholesome. There are dangers to be\r\nbraved in peace as well as in war. Yet our experience of the heroic\r\nqualities of the British soldier justifies the assumption that small\r\nbodies of them, placed in strongly fortified positions, could hold out\r\nagainst all comers until succour should arrive from the hill-stations,\r\nespecially now India is being traversed by railroads and telegraphs. But\r\neven these stations are not sufficient to restore patients suffering under\r\nchronic disease. These, if possible, should at once be sent home. The sick\r\nofficer is invalided, and speedily recovers in the air of his native land;\r\nthe common soldier, on the contrary, is forced to enter the hospital,--too\r\noften to die. The men, moreover, should be recruited for a shorter time.\r\nAt present they practically serve seventeen years in India,--a period\r\nwhich breaks down the constitutions of the majority. It is the exposure to\r\nheat for a great length of time, and not its intensity for a short period,\r\nthat destroys European life. If we entrap the ignorant labourer by the\r\nmost unworthy artifices,[31] we should, at least, be merciful to him. Let\r\nthe term of service be reduced to ten years, and then the stream of\r\nstalwart Britons, fresh from the mother-country, would enable us, in\r\nconjunction with hill-stations, to keep a powerful and resistless grasp\r\nupon the country.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that, if the sanitary condition of our army is so\r\nbad in times of peace, its sufferings in war must be greatly exaggerated.\r\nThe experience of the Peninsula, Walcheren, Burmah, and Sebastopol, has\r\nunfailingly proved this to be the case, and, in manifold instances, the\r\nevils were such as could have been avoided with ease.\r\n\r\n    \"The barracks and the military hospital,\" says Miss Nightingale,\r\n    \"exist at home and in the colonies as tests of our sanitary condition\r\n    in peace; and the histories of the Peninsular war, of Walcheren, and\r\n    of the late Crimean expedition, exist as tests of our sanitary\r\n    condition in the state of war. We have much more information on the\r\n    sanitary history of the Crimean campaign than we have of any other. It\r\n    is a complete example--history does not afford its equal--of an army,\r\n    after a great disaster arising from its neglects, having been brought\r\n    into the highest state of health and efficiency. It is the whole\r\n    experiment on a colossal scale. In all other examples the last step\r\n    has been wanting to complete the solution of the problem. We had in\r\n    the first seven months of the Crimean campaign a mortality among the\r\n    troops at the rate of 60 per cent. per annum from disease alone--a\r\n    rate of mortality which exceeds that of the great plague in the\r\n    population of London, and a higher ratio than the mortality in cholera\r\n    to the attacks; that is to say, that there died out of the army of the\r\n    Crimea an annual rate greater than ordinarily die in time of\r\n    pestilence out of sick. We had during the last six months of the war a\r\n    mortality among our _sick_ not much more than among our _healthy_\r\n    Guards at home, and a mortality among our troops in the last five\r\n    months _two-thirds only of what it is among our troops at home_.\"\r\n\r\nThis splendid testimony to the value of sanitary science, exhibited on the\r\nlargest scale, on an apparently hopeless field, is without appeal. The\r\nCommissioners propose a medical officer of health for the army,[32] second\r\nin rank to the principal medical officer, and attached to the\r\nquartermaster-general in the field. This officer, says the Report, should\r\nbe the head of the sanitary police of the army, should be answerable for\r\nall the measures to be adopted for the prevention of disease, and should\r\nreport to the quartermaster-general, and to the principal medical officer.\r\nIn order to prevent any evasion of responsibility, they further recommend\r\nthat the sanitary officer shall give his advice in writing, and that the\r\ndisregard of it on strategical grounds shall be equally recorded by the\r\nofficer in command. Having thus provided for the army in the field, the\r\nCommissioners propose that there shall be associated with the Medical\r\nDirector-General of the Army a sanitary, statistical, and medical\r\ncolleague. Each of these officers would be at the head of a distinct\r\ndepartment--the sanitary officer taking cognizance of all questions of\r\nfood, dress, diet, exercise, and lodging for the soldier; the statistical\r\ndepartment gathering together those invaluable details relative to the\r\nhealth of the army, for the want of which the British troops have so long\r\nsuffered a mortality out of all proportion to the civil community; while\r\nthe medical department would serve as a connecting link between civil and\r\nmilitary medicine, keeping the latter up to the last word of science, as\r\nspoken by the great medical authorities in all countries. Some of these\r\nsuggestions will require deep consideration before they are adopted.\r\nNothing, at any rate, must be permitted to fetter the absolute power of\r\nthe commander in the field, who must have a real as well as a nominal\r\nfreedom. But every precaution which can guard the health of the soldier\r\nwithout cramping the discretion of the general is demanded alike by\r\nhumanity and policy. What was so powerfully said in the last century has\r\nremained in a great degree true in our own. \"The life of a modern soldier\r\nis ill-represented by heroic fiction. War has means of destruction more\r\nformidable than the cannon and the sword. Of the thousands and ten\r\nthousands that perished in our late contests with France and Spain, a very\r\nsmall part ever felt the stroke of an enemy; the rest languished in tents\r\nand ships, amidst damps and putrefaction; pale, torpid, spiritless and\r\nhelpless; gasping and groaning unpitied among men, made obdurate by long\r\ncontinuance of hopeless misery; and were at last whelmed in pits or heaved\r\ninto the ocean, without notice or remembrance. By incommodious encampments\r\nand unwholesome stations, where courage is useless and enterprise\r\nimpracticable, fleets are silently dispeopled, and armies sluggishly\r\nmelted away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a needle turning upon a pivot were fixed at York, and if, by a wire\r\nplaced in close proximity to it, the needle could be made to move to the\r\nright or to the left through the agency of a power applied at the other\r\nend of the wire in London, and if it were agreed that one motion of the\r\nneedle to the left should signify _a_, and one to the right _b_, &c.,[33]\r\nwe should have just such a contrivance as the common needle telegraph now\r\nin use.\r\n\r\nSuch is the dry statement of a problem the more detailed working of which\r\nwe are about to explain to the reader.\r\n\r\nWhen a schoolboy places a sixpence and a piece of zinc in juxta-position\r\nwith each other in his mouth, he immediately perceives a singular taste,\r\nwhich as instantly disappears upon their separation; it is an experiment\r\nwhich most of us have performed, wondered at for a moment, and then\r\nforgotten. How little did we ever dream that in so doing we were calling\r\ninto life one of the most subtle, active, and universal agents in\r\nnature--a spirit like Ariel to carry our thoughts with the speed of\r\nthought to the uttermost ends of the earth--a workman more delicate of\r\nhand than the Florentine Cellini, and more resistless in force than the\r\nTitans of old!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIf now we place a piece of zinc, Z, and of copper, C, in a glass of\r\nacidulated water, instead of in the saliva of the mouth, and if we then\r\nattach to the piece of zinc the wire D K, and to the piece of copper the\r\nwire B A, and approximate the two ends, A K, until they touch, we shall\r\nhave the philosophic expression of the contrivance of the boy--a\r\ndecomposition of the water will immediately take place, and either as its\r\ncause or consequence--for scientific men have not yet decided which--an\r\nelectric current will flow in a continued stream from the zinc plate or\r\npositive pole to the copper plate or negative pole of the battery, and\r\nthis action, provided the plates are kept clean and the acidulated water\r\nis supplied, will go on as long as the materials last. If this little\r\ninstrument, which generates a very small amount of electric force, is\r\ncombined with others, as in figure 2,--the zinc plate of one cell being\r\nconnected with the copper plate of the next by a piece of wire--we shall\r\nhave the celebrated battery invented by Volta in 1800, in which the\r\naccumulated current, after flowing from one cell into another, by means of\r\nthe little hoops of wire, is transmitted along the large hoop, D K A B,\r\nfrom the one pole of the battery to the other. Within the narrow chambers\r\nof some such battery (which may be made of any number of cells, according\r\nto the force required), the motive power is generated by which the\r\nelectric telegraph is worked, and the large hoop by which its two poles\r\nare connected represents the telegraphic wire we see running beside the\r\nrailroad, whose office is to form a conducting pipe for the conveyance of\r\nthe electricity. Different substances possess this property in various\r\ndegrees; some, such as dry paper, not permitting the passage of the\r\nelectric fluid to any sensible extent; and others transmitting it with\r\ngreat freedom. Of all known bodies, the metals are the most perfect\r\nconductors, and copper is in this respect superior to iron; but the\r\nlatter, being cheaper and more durable, is commonly employed in the\r\nconstruction of the telegraph. Thus we have two of the indispensable\r\nrequisites--a constant force and a channel which conveys it from place to\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThere was yet a third thing necessary--some contrivance by which the force\r\ncould be made instrumental in forming signs or characters at its destined\r\ngoal; and this final condition was supplied by Oersted's discovery in\r\n1819, that a _magnetic_ needle is deflected by the passage of a circuit of\r\nelectricity through a wire parallel and in close neighbourhood to it. The\r\nfollowing cut will explain our meaning:--When the fluid passes from the U\r\npole of the battery in the direction of B A K L M Z, and enters V, its\r\nopposite pole, \"a current,\" as it is called, is completed, running from\r\nleft to right, the effect of which upon the needle, N, is to deflect it in\r\nthe direction of the dotted line (seen in perspective) 2, 3, or to an\r\nangle of 90 degrees, with the wire, if the current is sufficiently strong.\r\nIf, however, the current be reversed, and the electric fluid made to\r\ntraverse the wire from right to left, in the direction of the letters V Z\r\nM L K A B to the U end of the battery, the needle will immediately reverse\r\nits position and place itself at 90 degrees in the opposite direction.\r\nThis then is the whole principle and mystery of the needle telegraph, the\r\none still most extensively used in this country. The break that occurs\r\nbetween the letters B U and Z V is intended to show the method in which\r\nthe needle is made to work. \"Whilst the wires are thus apart the circuit\r\nis broken,\" or the fluid no longer passes along the wire, but immediately\r\nthey are approximated the circulation again commences, and the needle\r\n\"answers the helm.\" By the opening and closing, then, of this small space,\r\nwhich is effected by a lever, the needle is made to oscillate at will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe mere fact, however, of an electric current passing along a wire in\r\nproximity to a magnetic needle was not sufficient to enable any person to\r\nconstruct a telegraph. Would the needle be deflected by a wire, the\r\nbattery of which was placed at any considerable distance? it would not;\r\ntherefore, for all telegraphic purposes Oersted's discovery was worthless.\r\nSchweigger, however, soon after ascertained that by passing a great number\r\nof times round the needle a wire, thoroughly insulated by a \"serving\" of\r\nsilk thread, as shown in figure 4, the deflecting powers of the currant\r\nwere _multiplied_, and the sensibility of the instrument marvellously\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year that Oersted made his brilliant discovery, M. Arago\r\ndetected another law, which furnished a second method by which the\r\nelectric current could be made to tell its tale. He announced to the\r\nFrench Academy the fact so pregnant in its consequences, that the fluid\r\npossessed the power of imparting magnetism to steel or iron; and shortly\r\nafterwards our own countryman, Sturgeon, invented the first\r\nelectro-magnet, by coiling around a piece of soft iron a great length of\r\nfine insulated copper wire, the ends of which communicated with a battery.\r\nFigure 5 will give a rough idea of this instrument. The wire U B A, when\r\nit reaches the cylinder K L, is wound many times round it, and returns to\r\nthe battery at V. As long as the current is passing, the soft iron becomes\r\na magnet and attracts the iron armature P; but directly the circuit is\r\nbroken its magnetic power ceases, and P, by the action of a spring, flies\r\nback. It will at once be seen that by alternately making and breaking the\r\ncircuit, which can be done as fast as the hand can move the handle of a\r\nlever, an up and down movement of the armature P will take place, and this\r\nis the principle of action in Wheatstone's electro-magnetic dial\r\ninstrument and Morse's recording telegraph, so extensively used in\r\nAmerica. The general _modus operandi_ of the latter, which is a\r\ncontrivance of singular merit and efficiency, can be easily understood. At\r\nthe station at which the message is received, a poised iron lever has a\r\nmetal pin on its upper surface at one end, and an armature on its under\r\nsurface at the other end. When the magnet, which is placed beneath the\r\narmature, attracts and draws it down, the pin at the opposite extremity is\r\nraised, and presses against a strip of paper, which is moved between the\r\nmetal point, and a roller supported above it, at a uniform rate by means\r\nof clock-work. The pin or style will then make a simple dot, or trace\r\nlines of variable length upon the paper, according as the electric current\r\nis kept up only for a single instant, or for a longer period. \"The\r\nimpressions on the paper,\" says Dr. Turnbull, \"resemble the raised\r\nprinting for the blind.\" Out of these dots and lines an alphabet is formed\r\nsimilar to that which we have given in a subsequent page, when speaking of\r\nthe chemical telegraph at Bain. The instrument of Morse requires only a\r\nsingle wire to work it, and is, says the Abbé Moigno, \"an excellent\r\ntelegraph, very simple, very efficacious, and very rapid in its\r\ntransmissions. A practised clerk can indent on an average seventeen words\r\na minute, which is consequently as many as a skilful writer could\r\ntranscribe with a pen. It is, moreover, a great advantage to have fixed on\r\na band of paper the messages which the needle telegraphs merely figure in\r\nthe air.\"\r\n\r\nSince the year 1821 the principles of action of two of the working\r\ntelegraphs of the present day were known to scientific men, and the\r\nquestion naturally arises, how was it that it still took so many years to\r\nmake the telegraph a working fact? The answer is, that the combination of\r\ncircumstances necessary to bring it to perfection had not arisen. What\r\ninterest had practical men in carrying out the dreams of philosophers? No\r\none imagined that it would ever become a necessary social engine, or that\r\nit would pay \"seven per cent.\" to a public Company. The patronage of the\r\nGovernment could alone have been looked to by any of the proposers of the\r\nnew method of telegraphy, and the sort of encouragement received from this\r\nquarter may be judged from the fact that when Mr. Ronalds attempted to\r\ndraw the attention of some of the officials to the working of his\r\ninstrument, they did not even deign to pay it a visit, but returned for\r\nanswer, \"That the telegraph was of no use in time of peace, and that the\r\nsemaphore in time of war answered all the required purposes.\" The occasion\r\nthat suddenly ripened the invention and brought it into practical\r\noperation was the introduction of railroads. Were it not for the universal\r\nspread of this new means of locomotion, the telegraph might still have\r\nremained in that limbo from which so many discoveries have never emerged.\r\nThe vast advantage to a railroad of a method of conveying signals\r\ninstantaneously throughout its entire length was at once seen, and the\r\ncontinuity of its property, together with the protection afforded by its\r\nservants, presented facilities for its introduction and maintenance which\r\nhad never before occurred.\r\n\r\nA problem of great scientific interest as well as of practical importance\r\nin connection with the electric telegraph had still to be solved. The\r\nexperiments of Dr. Watson on Shooter's Hill, in the middle of the last\r\ncentury, proved, it is true, that _a shock of electricity_ passed along a\r\nfour mile circuit without any appreciable loss of time, but nothing was\r\ndefinitely known about the speed at which it really travelled. This\r\ndifficult question was answered by Professor Wheatstone. His beautiful\r\ninvestigations on the subject were made by means of a very rapidly\r\nrevolving mirror, upon which the passage of the electric fluid, at\r\ndifferent and distant parts of a severed wire, was indicated by sparks,\r\nwhich appeared as lines of light on the rapidly turning glass, on the same\r\nprinciple that a bit of lighted charcoal whirled round and round in the\r\nair appears as a circle of fire. By this instrument, which we cannot\r\nrender intelligible to the general reader, but for a fuller account of\r\nwhich we refer him to the Philosophical Transactions of 1834, he made it\r\nevident to the eye that one spark or leap of the electric fluid did occur\r\nbefore the other--thus proving that its transit along the wire _was_ a\r\nmatter of time. The manner in which he took measure of this infinitesimal\r\nperiod was extremely ingenious. By attaching a hollow piece of metal--a\r\nmetallic humming-top as it were--to the spindle of his revolving mirror,\r\nand at the same time directing a current of air against it, he was enabled\r\nto test its speed by the pitch of the sound produced: this once known, the\r\nmeasuring of time that elapsed between the different sparks was easy. Thus\r\nhe forced the lightning to tell how fast it was going. His\r\nadmirably-contrived apparatus has since proved of considerable use to\r\nphilosophers in measuring very minute parts of time, and scientific men\r\ncan now with the greatest ease ascertain the period a flash of light takes\r\nto traverse a distance of 50 feet--and light, be it remembered, travels at\r\nthe speed of 200,000 miles a second!\r\n\r\nBy this experiment it appeared that electricity travels through a\r\ncopper-wire with at least the velocity of light through the celestial\r\nspace, though the recent experiments made for Professor Bache, director of\r\nthe national survey of America, have proved that the velocity of the\r\ncurrent through suspended _iron_ wires is not more than 15,400 miles per\r\nsecond. The philosophic proof of the marvellous rate at which the electric\r\ncurrent moved, doubtless turned many minds once more in the direction of\r\nthe long sought for telegraph, and it is not surprising that the eminent\r\nelucidator of the fact was among the number. A short time after this he\r\ninsulated four miles of wire in the vaults of King's College, on which he\r\nperformed most of his subsequent experiments.[34] Thus in the silence of\r\nthese gloomy vaults, as early as 1836, the lightning that was to flash\r\nwith intelligence round the world--the nervous system so shortly destined\r\nto spread itself through two hemispheres, string together continents and\r\nislands, and carry human thought under the wide-spreading seas, was slowly\r\nbeing trained to the service of man by one of the most distinguished of\r\nthe many philosophers who have contributed to the development of this\r\nbranch of science.\r\n\r\nFollowing up his experiment, Professor Wheatstone worked out the\r\narrangements of his telegraph, and having associated himself in 1837 with\r\nMr. Cooke, who had previously devoted much time to the same subject, a\r\npatent was taken out in the June of that year in their joint names. Their\r\ntelegraph had five wires and five needles; the latter being worked upon\r\nthe face of a lozenge-shaped dial inscribed with the letters of the\r\nalphabet, any one of which could be indicated by the convergence of two of\r\nthe needles. This very ingenious instrument could be manipulated by any\r\nperson who knew how to read, and did not labour under the disadvantage of\r\nworking by a code which required time to be understood. Immediately upon\r\nthe taking out of the patent, the directors of the North Western Railway\r\nsanctioned the laying down of wires between the Euston Square and Camden\r\nTown stations, and towards the end of July the telegraph was ready to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening of the 25th of that month, in a dingy little room near\r\nthe booking-office at Euston square, by the light of a flaring dip-candle,\r\nwhich only illuminated the surrounding darkness, sat the inventor, with a\r\nbeating pulse and a heart full of hope. In an equally small room at the\r\nCamden Town station, where the wires terminated, sat Mr. Cooke, his\r\nco-patentee, and among others, two witnesses well known to fame, Mr.\r\nCharles Fox and Mr. Stephenson. These gentlemen listened to the first word\r\nspelt by that trembling tongue of steel which will only cease to discourse\r\nwith the extinction of man himself. Mr. Cooke in his turn touched the keys\r\nand returned the answer. \"Never did I feel such a tumultuous sensation\r\nbefore,\" said the Professor, \"as when all alone in the still room I heard\r\nthe needles click, and as I spelled the words I felt all the magnitude of\r\nthe invention, now proved to be practical beyond cavil or dispute.\" The\r\ntelegraph thenceforward, as far as its mechanism was concerned, went on\r\nwithout a check, and the modifications of this instrument, which is still\r\nin use, have been made for the purpose of rendering it more economical in\r\nits construction and working, two wires at present being employed, and in\r\nsome cases only one.\r\n\r\nA frequently renewed and still unsettled controversy has arisen upon the\r\npoint of who is to be considered the first contriver of the telegraph in\r\nthe form which made it available for popular use. Two names alone are now\r\nput forward to dispute the claim with Wheatstone--Steinheil of Munich and\r\nMorse of New York.\r\n\r\nFrom a communication of M. Arago to the French Academy of Sciences, it\r\nappears that the telegraph of Steinheil was in operation, for a distance\r\nof seven miles, on the 19th of July, 1837, the same month in which\r\nWheatstone put his own contrivance to the test upon the North Western\r\nRailway. But besides that the patent of Wheatstone was taken out in the\r\npreceding June, and was itself founded upon previous and thoroughly\r\nsuccessful experiments, there is another material circumstance which gives\r\nhim a claim to priority over Steinheil, viz., that the latter published no\r\ndescription of his instrument until August, 1838, that he altered and\r\nimproved it in the interval, and that the only accounts we have of his\r\ncontrivance describe its amended and not its original form. It was,\r\nhowever, a very meritorious performance, and, in addition to its other\r\nexcellences, Steinheil was the first who employed the earth to complete\r\nthe circuit--a most important fact, which we shall explain hereafter.\r\nStill his telegraph was inferior in its mechanical arrangements to that of\r\nWheatstone, and the inventor himself soon abandoned it in favour of a\r\nmodification of the instrument of Morse.\r\n\r\nMorse dates his claim to _the invention of the telegraph_ from the year\r\n1832, when the first idea of such an instrument, he tells us, struck him\r\nas he was returning home from Havre in the ship Sully. A fellow-passenger,\r\nProfessor Jackson, it appears, was in the habit of amusing himself, in\r\ncommon with the rest of the passengers, with some accounts of the wonders\r\nof electricity; and when Morse later developed his contrivance, Professor\r\nJackson not only claimed it as a plagiarism from his own conversation, but\r\nadded that Morse was so ignorant as to ask, upon hearing the term\r\nElectro-Magnetism, \"In what does that differ from ordinary Magnetism?\" The\r\ntelegraph was at best, on the part of both of them, a crude idea; and it\r\nwas not till September, 1837, that Professor Morse was able to exhibit his\r\nstill imperfect machinery in action. He ultimately succeeded, as we have\r\nbefore stated, in producing a telegraph of first-rate excellence; and, out\r\nof 15,000 miles of wire which had been erected by 1852 in the United\r\nStates, 12,124 were worked on the system of Morse.\r\n\r\nThe question of priority is, in our opinion, after all, of no sort of\r\nimportance, at least as regards the rival claims of Wheatstone and\r\nSteinheil. When the progress of science has prepared the way for a great\r\ndiscovery, two geniuses will occasionally take the step together, because\r\neach is able to take the step of a giant. It was thus that the Calculus\r\nwas found out by both Newton and Leibnitz, and the place of Neptune in the\r\nheavens by both Adams and Leverrier. It was the same with the telegraph.\r\nThe investigations of Wheatstone and Steinheil were entirely independent\r\nof each other, and it cannot lessen the merit of either that there was a\r\nsecond man in Europe who was equal to the task.\r\n\r\nThere are some who dispute Professor Wheatstone's claim, by urging that,\r\ninasmuch as all the main features of the telegraph existed before he took\r\nout his patent, there was nothing left to invent. It is true that much had\r\nbeen done, but it is equally certain that there was much to do. When\r\nWheatstone first directed his attention to electricity as a means of\r\ncommunicating thoughts to a distance, the telegraph was a useless and\r\ninoperative machine. He and his partner established as a working, paying\r\nfact, what had hitherto been little better than a philosophic toy. To\r\nthose who now disparage the Professor's labours we think it sufficient to\r\nreply by the admirable saying of the French _savant_, M. Biot, \"Nothing is\r\nso easy as the discovery of yesterday; nothing so difficult as the\r\ndiscovery of to-day.\"\r\n\r\nLet us return, however, to the history of the telegraph in England, from\r\nwhich we have digressed. After the successful working of the\r\nmile-and-a-quarter line, the Directors of the London and Birmingham\r\nRailway proposed to lay it down to the latter town if the Birmingham and\r\nLiverpool Directors would continue it on their line; but they objected,\r\nand the telegraph received notice to quit the ground it already occupied.\r\nOf course, its sudden disappearance would have branded it as a failure in\r\nmost men's minds, and, in all probability, the telegraph would have been\r\nput back many years, had not Mr. Brunel, to his honour, in 1839,\r\ndetermined to adopt it on the Great Western line. It was accordingly\r\ncarried at first as far as West Drayton, thirteen miles, and afterwards to\r\nSlough, a distance of eighteen miles. The wires were not at this early\r\ndate suspended upon posts, but insulated and encased in an iron tube,\r\nwhich was placed beneath the ground.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph hitherto had been strictly confined to railway business, and\r\nin furtherance of this object Brunel proposed to continue it to Bristol as\r\nsoon as the line was opened. Here, again, the folly and blindness of\r\nrailway proprietors threw obstacles in the way, which led, however, to an\r\nunlooked-for application of its powers to public purposes. At a general\r\nmeeting of the proprietors of the Great Western Railway in Bristol, a Mr.\r\nHayward, of Manchester, got up and denounced the invention as a\r\n\"new-fangled scheme,\" and managed to pass a resolution repudiating the\r\nagreement entered into with the patentees. Thus within a few years we find\r\nthe telegraph rejected by two of the most powerful railway companies, the\r\npersons above all others who ought to have welcomed it with acclamation.\r\n\r\nTo keep the wires on the ground, Mr. Cooke proposed to maintain it at his\r\nown expense, and was permitted by the directors to do so on condition of\r\nsending their railway signals free of charge, and of extending the line to\r\nSlough. In return, he was allowed to transmit the messages of the public.\r\nHere commences the first popular use of the telegraph in England, or in\r\nany other country. The tariff was one shilling per message. The effect of\r\nthis low charge was to develop a class of business which seems beneath the\r\nnotice of the powerful company now in possession of most of the\r\ntelegraphic lines in the kingdom. The transactions of the retail dealers\r\nare considered too petty, perhaps, for their attention; but there can be\r\nno doubt that the comfort of the public would be vastly increased, and\r\nalso the revenues of the company, if they would only condescend to take a\r\nlesson by the commercial experience of this shilling tariff, the working\r\nof which we will illustrate by transcribing from the telegraph book at\r\nPaddington a few specimens of the messages sent:--\r\n\r\n    \"Commercial News. 1844, Nov. 1, Slough, 4.10 P.M.--'Send a messenger\r\n    to Mr. Harris, poulterer, Duke-street, Manchester-square, and order\r\n    him to send twelve more chickens to Mr. Finch, High-street, Windsor,\r\n    by the 5.0 P.M. down train, without fail.' Answer: Paddington, 5.5\r\n    P.M.--'The chickens are sent by the 5.0 P.M. train.'\r\n\r\n    \"Slough, 7.35 P.M.--'A Mr. Thomas B., a first-class passenger, 6.30\r\n    P.M. train, left a blue cloak with a velvet collar in first-class\r\n    booking-office. Send it by mail train if found.'\r\n\r\n    \"Paddington 7.45 P.M.--'There are two such cloaks in the\r\n    booking-office: has Mr. B.'s any mark on any part of it?' Slough, 7.47\r\n    P.M.--'Mr. B.'s has the mark × under the collar, inside.'\r\n\r\n    \"Paddington, 7.55 P.M.--'Cloak found, and will be sent on as\r\n    requested.'\r\n\r\n    \"Slough, Nov. 11, 1844, 4.3 P.M.--'Send a messenger to Mr. Harris,\r\n    Duke-street, Manchester-square, and request him to send 6 lbs. of\r\n    white bait and 4 lbs. of sausages, by the 5.40 train, to Mr. Finch, of\r\n    Windsor they must be sent by 5.30 down train, or not at all.'\r\n\r\n    \"Paddington, 5.27 P.M.--'Messenger returned with articles which will\r\n    be sent by 5.30 train, as requested.'\"\r\n\r\nThe first application of the telegraph to police purposes took place about\r\nthis time on the Great Western Railway, and, as it was the first\r\nintimation thieves got of the electric constable being on duty, it is full\r\nof interest. The following extracts are from the telegraph book kept at\r\nthe Paddington station:--\r\n\r\n    \"Eaton Montem day, August 28, 1844.--The Commissioners of Police have\r\n    issued orders that several officers of the detective force shall be\r\n    stationed at Paddington to watch the movements of suspicious persons,\r\n    going by the down-train, and give notice by the electric telegraph to\r\n    the Slough station of the number of such suspected persons, and dress,\r\n    their names if known, also the carriages in which they are.\"\r\n\r\nNow come the messages following one after the other, and influencing the\r\nfate of the marked individuals with all the celerity, certainty, and\r\ncalmness of the Nemesis of the Greek drama:--\r\n\r\n    \"Paddington, 10.20 A.M.--'Mail train just started. It contains three\r\n    thieves, named Sparrow, Burrell, and Spurgeon, in the first\r\n    compartment of the fourth first-class carriage.'\r\n\r\n    \"Slough, 10.48 A.M.--'Mail train arrived. _The officers have cautioned\r\n    the three thieves._'\r\n\r\n    \"Paddington, 10.50 A.M.--'Special train just left. It contained two\r\n    thieves: one named Oliver Martin, who is dressed in black, _crape on\r\n    his hat_; the other named Fiddler Dick, in black trowsers and light\r\n    blouse. Both in the third compartment of the first second-class\r\n    carriage.'\r\n\r\n    \"Slough, 11.16 A.M.--'Special train arrived. Officers have taken the\r\n    two thieves into custody, a lady having lost her bag, containing a\r\n    purse with two sovereigns and some silver in it; one of the sovereigns\r\n    was sworn to by the lady as having been her property. It was found in\r\n    Fiddler Dick's watch-fob.'\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that, on the arrival of the train, a policeman opened the door\r\nof the \"third compartment of the first second-class carriage\" and asked\r\nthe passengers if they had missed anything? A search in pockets and bags\r\naccordingly ensued, until one lady called out that her purse was gone.\r\n\"Fiddler Dick, you are wanted,\" was the immediate demand of the\r\npolice-officer, beckoning to the culprit, who came out of the carriage\r\nthunderstruck at the discovery, and gave himself up, together with the\r\nbooty, with the air of a completely beaten man. The effect of the capture\r\nso cleverly brought about is thus spoken of in the telegraph book:--\r\n\r\n    \"Slough, 11.51 A.M.--'Several of the suspected persons who came by the\r\n    various down-trains are lurking about Slough, uttering bitter\r\n    invectives against the telegraph. Not one of those cautioned has\r\n    ventured to proceed to the Montem.'\"\r\n\r\nEver after this the lightfingered gentry avoided the railway and the _too_\r\nintelligent companion that ran beside it, and betook themselves again to\r\nthe road--a retrograde step, to which on all great public occasions they\r\ncontinue to adhere.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph, even up to this period, was very little known to the great\r\nmass of the public, and might have continued for some time longer in\r\nobscurity but for its remarkable agency in causing the arrest of the\r\nquaker Tawell. This event, which took place on the afternoon of Friday,\r\nJanuary 3rd, 1845, placed it before the world as a prominent instrument in\r\na terrible drama, and at once drew universal attention to its\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined, however, that Mr. Wheatstone's was the only\r\npatent taken out for a telegraph in the year 1837. A number of inquiring\r\nminds were simultaneously with the Professor wandering in the tangled wood\r\nof doubt, and when he burst his way through, others speedily emerged at\r\ndifferent points, one after another. Consequently, the year 1837 was\r\ndistinguished by a complete crop of telegraphs, any one of which would\r\nperhaps have held its ground had it stood alone, but not one of them was\r\npractically equal to the first, and they have all long since departed to\r\nthe tomb, already stored with the abortive results of so many merely\r\ningenious minds.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the needle instrument transmits messages, the\r\nsmall amount of electricity required to work it, and the simplicity of its\r\nconstruction, are its chief recommendations. Upwards of 200 letters can be\r\nforwarded by it within the minute. Its great drawback--a drawback that\r\nwill appear greater every year--is that it can only be worked by a system\r\nof signs, which requires some practice to understand. As long as the\r\npublic is content to send its messages open to the light of day, this plan\r\nwill hold its ground, as a practised manipulator can indicate the letters\r\nas fast as it is possible to read, much less transcribe them, at the other\r\nend of the wire; but immediately that the public come to demand\r\nsecrecy--to put a seal as of old on its letters--this telegraph will, we\r\npredict, fall into _public_ disuse; and the revolving dial telegraph,\r\ninvented by Mr. Wheatstone, in 1840, or the recording telegraph of Bain or\r\nMorse, or, more likely still, the American printing telegraph of House,\r\nwill come into play.\r\n\r\nThis latter instrument appears to contain within itself capabilities of\r\nvery high excellence; for instance, it requires no one to interpret, and\r\nthen to re-write its messages--this it does itself. In fact it extends the\r\ncompositor's fingers as far as the wire can be stretched. Messages are\r\nthus printed at the rate of fifty letters a minute, say at five hundred\r\nmiles distance, in common Roman characters, on long slips of paper similar\r\nto those used on the recording instrument. Any description of its\r\ncomplicated mechanism would be utterly unintelligible to general readers.\r\n\"While the arrangements of the telegraph of Morse,\" said Mr. Justice\r\nWoodbury, of America, in giving judgment in a patent case, \"can be readily\r\nunderstood by most mechanics and men of science, it requires days, if not\r\nweeks with some, thoroughly to comprehend all the parts and movements of\r\nthe telegraph of House.\" His system is in use for thousands of miles of\r\nthe American lines. Bakewell's copying telegraph is naturally suggested by\r\nthe telegraph of House, from the fact that it reproduces its messages,\r\nalthough in a different manner. The sender of the message may be said to\r\nwrite with a pen long enough to stretch to the most distant correspondent;\r\nthat is, he not only forwards instantaneously the substance of a message,\r\nbut it is conveyed in his own handwriting. The principle is similar to\r\nthat of Davy's chemical recording telegraph. The person sending the\r\nmessage writes it on a piece of tin foil with a pen dipped in varnish or\r\nany other non-conducting substance; this message is then placed round a\r\nmetal cylinder, which is made to revolve at a certain regulated pace. In\r\ncontact with this cylinder is a blunt steel point, which, by the action of\r\na screw, makes a spiral line from the top to the bottom of the cylinder,\r\nthus touching every portion of the written message enveloping it. In\r\nconnection with the steel point is the conducting wire, and at the end of\r\nthe wire is a similar steel point working spirally upon a like cylinder.\r\nIt will be at once seen that the current will always be transmitted,\r\nexcept at those portions of the tin foil which are covered with the\r\nnon-conducting varnish, and which, therefore, cut off the flow of\r\nelectricity, and the handwriting will appear at the other end of the\r\ntelegraphic wire upon a piece of chemically-prepared paper rolled upon its\r\ncylinder, and moving synchronously with it. The transmitted letter appears\r\nto be written in white upon a dark ground, the white parts, of course,\r\nindicating where the current has been broken, and where, consequently, no\r\ndecomposition of the chemical paper has taken place.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to our subject after this little digression. At the\r\nsame time that the first working telegraph was being simplified and\r\nimproved, the system was gradually spreading, and, by the end of the year\r\n1845, lines exceeding 500 miles in extent were in operation in England,\r\nworking Messrs. Wheatstone and Cook's patents. In the following year,\r\ncapital, as represented by the powerful Electric Telegraph Company,\r\ncommenced its operations, and an immediate and rapid development of the\r\nnew method of carrying intelligence was the result.\r\n\r\n\"A period of eight years has elapsed,\" as they say in a certain class of\r\ndrama, and let us now look upon the condition of electric-telegraphy in\r\nEngland. We left it exerting its influence in a disjointed manner over a\r\nfew railways, and striking out its wires here and there at random, without\r\ngoverning head or organization; and how do we find it?\r\n\r\nJammed in between lofty houses, at the bottom of a narrow court in\r\nLothbury, we see before us a stuccoed wall, ornamented with an electric\r\nilluminated clock. Who would think that behind this narrow forehead lay\r\nthe great brain,--if we may so term it,--of the nervous system of Britain,\r\nor that beneath the narrow pavement of the alley lies its spinal chord,\r\ncomposed of hundreds of fibres, which transmit intelligence as unperceived\r\nas does the medulla oblongata beneath the skin? Emerging from this narrow\r\nchannel, the \"efferent\" wires branch off beneath the different footways,\r\nramify in certain plexuses within the great centre of intelligence itself,\r\nand then shoot out along the different lines of railway until the shores\r\nof the island would seem to interpose a limit to their further progress.\r\nNot so, however:--beneath the seas, under the heaving waves covered with\r\nstately navies, they take their darksome way, until, with the burden of\r\ntheir moving fire, they emerge once more upon the foreign strand, and\r\ncommence afresh their career over the wide expanse of the Continent.\r\n\r\nAnd now, like a curious physiologist, let us examine the various parts of\r\nthis ingeniously-constructed sensorium, and endeavour to show our readers\r\nhow in this high chamber, fashioned by human hands, thoughts circulate,\r\nand ideas come and go. The door of the \"Central Telegraph Station\" leads\r\nimmediately into the Central Hall, an oblong space, open quite up to the\r\nroof, which presents an appearance something like the Coal Exchange or the\r\nGeological Museum, two tiers of galleries being suspended from the bare\r\nwalls, and affording communication to the different parts of the building.\r\nIf we ascend the first gallery, and lean over the balustrade, we shall get\r\na very clear bird's-eye view of the method in which messages are received\r\nand transmitted. Here, man, like the watchful spider, sits centered within\r\nhis radiating web, and \"lives along the line.\" Beneath us runs a sweep of\r\ncounter forming three sides of a quadrangle, divided into compartments of\r\nabout a square yard by green curtains. A desk and printed forms, to be\r\nfilled up, are placed in each of these isolated cells, towards which we\r\nsee individuals immediately make, and then bury themselves, being for the\r\ntime profoundly intent upon the printed form.\r\n\r\nWe all know the jocose excuse of the correspondent for having written a\r\nlong letter--that he had not time to make it shorter. And truly it\r\nrequires some art to be laconic enough to satisfy the pocket in this\r\nestablishment. Let us watch, for instance, yonder youth: he seems to have\r\nfilled his sheet very close--now he gives it in to the receiving-clerk,\r\nand something evidently is wrong, for he looks perplexed--it is some hitch\r\nabout the charge, for his attention is directed to the scale of prices\r\nprinted at the head of the paper.\r\n\r\n    \"Messages (not exceeding twenty words) can be sent between all the\r\n    principal towns in Great Britain at a charge of 1_s._ within a circuit\r\n    of 50 miles, of 2_s._ 6_d._ within a circuit of 100 miles\r\n    (geographical distance), and of 5_s._ beyond a circuit of 100 miles,\r\n    with an additional sum of 6_d._ porterage within half a mile of the\r\n    station.\"\r\n\r\n\"Economy,\" says a French writer, M. de Courcy, \"teaches conciseness. The\r\ntelegraphic style banishes all the forms of politeness. 'May I ask you to\r\ndo me the favour,' is 6d. for a distance of fifty miles.\" How many of\r\nthose fond adjectives, therefore, must our poor fellow relentlessly strike\r\nout to bring his billet down to a reasonable charge! What food for\r\nspeculation each person affords, as he writes his hurried epistle,\r\ndictated either by fear, or greed, or more powerful love!--for we have not\r\nyet got into the habit of employing the telegraph, like the Americans, on\r\nthe mere every-day business of life. Every message--and of these there are\r\n350,000 transmitted by this Company yearly for the public, and upwards of\r\n3,500,000 for the Railways--is faithfully copied, and put by in fire-proof\r\nsafes, those sent by the recording telegraph being wound in tape-like\r\nlengths upon a roller, and appearing exactly like discs of sarcenet\r\nribbon. Fancy some future Macaulay rummaging among such a store, and\r\npainting therefrom the salient features of the social and commercial life\r\nof England in the nineteenth century. If from the Household Book of the\r\nDuke of Northumberland, or still later, from the Paston Letters, we can\r\ncatch such glimpses of the manners of an early age, what might not be\r\ngathered some day in the twenty-first century from a record of the\r\ncorrespondence of an entire people?\r\n\r\n\"Softly, softly,\" interposes the Secretary of the Company, \"we have no\r\nsuch intention of gratifying posterity; for, after a certain brief period\r\nall copies of communications are destroyed. No person unconnected with\r\nthe office is, under any consideration, allowed to have access to them,\r\nand the servants of the Company are under a bond not to divulge 'the\r\nsecrets of the prison-house.'\" Very good, as far as the present generation\r\nis concerned; nevertheless, it is devoutly to be wished that an odd box or\r\ntwo of these sarcenet ribbons, with their linear language, may escape, for\r\nfuture Rawlinsons to puzzle over and decipher for the instruction of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nWhilst we have been thus speculating, however, a dozen messages for all\r\nparts of the kingdom have successively ascended, through the long lift\r\nbefore us, to the instrument-rooms, of which there are two, situated in\r\nthe attics of the establishment, on either side of the top gallery of the\r\ncentral hall; these, to carry out our anatomical simile, might be called\r\nthe two hemispheres of the establishment's cerebrum. The instruments of\r\none of these rooms are worked by youths, while those of the other are\r\nmanipulated by young ladies; and it seems to us as though the directors\r\nwere pitting them against each other--establishing a kind of industrial\r\ntournament--to see which description of labourer is worthiest. As yet,\r\nlittle or no difference can be detected: this, however, is in itself a\r\ntriumph for the fair sex, as it proves their capacity for a species of\r\nemployment well calculated for their habits and physical powers, and opens\r\nanother door for that superabundance of female labour of a superior kind\r\nwhich has hitherto sought employment in vain.\r\n\r\nClick, click, go the needles on every hand as we enter. Here we see the\r\niron tongues of the telegraph wagging, and talking as fast as a tea-table\r\nfull of old maids. London is holding communication with Manchester.\r\nPlymouth is listening attentively to a long story, and every now and then\r\nintimates by a slight movement that he perfectly comprehends. But there is\r\none speaker whose nimble tongue seems to be saying important things by the\r\nstir around him,--that is _the Hague_ whispering under the North Sea the\r\nnews he has heard, an hour or so ago, from Vienna of a great victory just\r\ngained by the Turks. We are witness to a series of conversations carried\r\non with all corners of the island, and between the metropolis of the\r\nworld and every capital of northern and central Europe, as intimately as\r\nthough the speakers were bending their heads over the dinner-table, and\r\ntalking confidentially to the host. And by what agency is this\r\nextraordinary conversation carried on? All that the visitor sees is a\r\nnumber of little mahogany cases, very similar to those of American clocks,\r\neach having a dial, with two lozenge-shaped needles working by pivots,\r\nwhich hang, when at rest, perpendicularly upon it. Two dependant handles,\r\nsituated at the base of this instrument, which the operator grasps and\r\nmoves from side to side at his will, suffice to make and break the\r\ncurrents or reverse them, and consequently to deflect the needles either\r\nto the right or left. Two little stops of ivory are placed about half an\r\ninch apart, on either side of the needle, to prevent its deflecting too\r\nmuch, and to check all vibration. It is the sound of the iron tongue\r\nstriking against these stops that makes the clicking, and to which the\r\ntelegraphists are sensitively alive. In the early days of telegraphy, the\r\noperator's attention, at all the stations, was drawn to the instrument by\r\nthe sudden ringing of an alarum, which was effected by the agency of an\r\nelectro-magnet; but the horrid din it occasioned became insupportable to\r\npersons in constant attendance, and this part of the instrument was\r\nspeedily given up, the clicking of the needle being found quite sufficient\r\nto draw his attention to the arrival or passing of a message. We say _or\r\npassing_ of a message, because, when a communication is made, as for\r\ninstance, between London and Edinburgh, the needles of all the\r\ntelegraph-stations on the line are simultaneously deflected, but the\r\nattendant has only to take notice of what is going on when a special\r\nsignal is made to his particular locality, informing him that _he_ is\r\nspoken with. A story is told of a certain somnolent station clerk, who, in\r\norder to enjoy his nap, trained his terrier to scratch and awaken him at\r\nthe first sound of the clicking needles.\r\n\r\nThere are but two kinds of telegraph used by the company, the needle\r\ntelegraph and a few of the chemical recording telegraph of Bain. The\r\nlatter instrument strikes the spectator more, perhaps, than the\r\nnimble-working needle apparatus, but its action is equally simple. Slits\r\nof variable length representing letters, according to the alphabet in the\r\nnote,[35] are punched out from a long strip of paper called the\r\nmessage-strip, which is placed between a revolving cylinder and a toothed\r\nspring. The battery is connected with the cylinder; the wire, which goes\r\nfrom station to station, is joined to the spring. As dry paper is a\r\nnon-conductor, no electricity passes while the unpierced portion of the\r\nmessage-slip interposes between the cylinder and the tooth; but when the\r\ntooth drops into a space, and comes in contact with the cylinder, the\r\ncurrent flows. If we now transfer our attention to the station at which\r\nthe message is received, we find a similar cylinder revolving at a regular\r\nrate, and a metal pin, depending from the end of the telegraph wire,\r\npressing upon it; but in this case the paper between the cylinder and the\r\npin has been washed with a solution of prussiate of potash, which\r\nelectricity has the effect of changing to Prussian blue at the point where\r\nthe pin touches it. Therefore, as the chemically prepared paper moves\r\nunder the pin, a blue line is formed of the same length as the slits at\r\nthe other end, which regulate the duration of the electric current; and\r\nthus every letter punched upon the message-strip is faithfully transferred\r\nto its distant fellow. Such is the celerity with which the notation is\r\ntransmitted by this method, that \"in an experiment performed by M. Le\r\nVerrier and Dr. Lardner, before committees of the Institute and the\r\nLegislative Assembly at Paris, despatches were sent 1,000 miles at the\r\nrate of nearly 20,000 words an hour.\" In ordinary practice, however, the\r\nspeed is limited to the rate at which an expert clerk can punch out the\r\nholes, which is not much above a hundred per minute. Where the object was\r\nto forward long documents, such as a speech, a number of persons could be\r\nemployed simultaneously in punching out different portions of the message,\r\nand the message-strips would then be supplied as fast as the machine could\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis system is used extensively in America. A weaker current of\r\nelectricity than what is required for deflecting needles or magnetising\r\niron, suffices to effect the requisite chemical decomposition. The\r\nconducting power of vapour or rain carries much of the electricity from\r\nthe wires in certain states of the atmosphere; \"and in such cases, where\r\nboth Morse's and Bain's telegraphs are used by an amalgamated company in\r\nthe same office, it is found convenient to remove the wires from Morse's\r\ninstruments, and connect them with Bain's, on which it is practicable to\r\noperate when communication by Morse's system is\r\ninterrupted.\"--(_Whitworth's Report_, p. 51.)\r\n\r\nThis chemical telegraph has also the advantage, in common with all\r\nrecording instruments, that it leaves an indelible record of every message\r\ntransmitted, and therefore is very useful when the mistake of a single\r\nfigure or letter might be of consequence, which we will illustrate by a\r\ncase which happened very lately. A stockbroker in the City received,\r\nduring a very agitated state of the funds, an order to buy for a client in\r\na distant part of the country, by a certain time of the day, 80,000_l._ of\r\nconsols. This order being unusually large for the individual, the broker\r\ndoubted its accuracy, and immediately made inquiries at the office. The\r\nmessage had luckily been sent by the recording instrument, and upon\r\nlooking at the record it was immediately seen that the order was for\r\n8,000_l._, the transcriber having put in an 0 too much, for which,\r\naccording to the rules of the company, he was incontinently fined. Now,\r\nhere the error was immediately traced to the person who made it, and there\r\nwas no need of telegraphing back to inquire if all were right, two matters\r\nof vital importance in such a transaction as this, involving so much\r\npersonal responsibility; for if the purchase had been made and turned out\r\nunfortunate, the loss would indubitably have fallen upon the unhappy\r\nsharebroker.[36]\r\n\r\nIn all ordinary transactions, however, the needle instrument is\r\npreferable, because it transmits its messages much more quickly. The speed\r\nwith which the attendants upon these instruments read off the signals made\r\nby the needles is really marvellous: they do not in some cases even wait\r\nto spell the words letter by letter, but jump at the sentence before it is\r\nconcluded; and they have learned by practice, as Sir Francis Head says in\r\n\"Stokers and Pokers,\" to recognize immediately who is telegraphing to\r\nthem, say at York, by the peculiar _expression of the needles_, the long\r\ndrawn wires thus forming a kind of human antennæ by which individual\r\npeculiarities of touch are projected to an infinite distance. To catalogue\r\nthe kind of messages which pass through the room, either on their way from\r\nLondon or in course of distribution to it, would be to give a history of\r\nhuman affairs. Here, from the shores of this tight island, comes the\r\nmorning news gathered by watchers, telescopes in hand, on remote\r\nheadlands, of what ships have just hove in sight, or what craft have\r\nfoundered or come ashore--to this room, swifter beyond comparison than the\r\ncarrier-dove of old, the wire speeds the name of the winner of the Derby\r\nor the Oaks. How the four winds are blowing throughout the island; how\r\nstocks rise or fall every hour of the day in all the great towns and in\r\nthe continental capitals; what corn is at Mark Lane, and what farmer Giles\r\ngot a quarter of an hour since in a country town in Yorkshire, are equally\r\nknown in the telegraph room. Intermixed with quotations of tallow and the\r\nprice of Wall's End coals, now and then comes a love-billet, which excites\r\nno more sympathy in the clerk than in the iron that conveys it; or a\r\nnotice that the sudden dart of death has struck some distant friend, is\r\ntransmitted and received as unconcernedly as an account of the fall in\r\nRussian stock. When business is slack the telegraphists sometimes amuse\r\nthemselves by an interchange of badinage with their distant friends. Sir\r\nFrancis Head informs us that an absolute quarrel once took place by\r\ntelegraph, and the two irritated manipulators were obliged to be separated\r\nin consequence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this private message department there is, below stairs, an\r\nintelligence office, in which news published in the London morning papers\r\nis condensed and forwarded to the Exchanges of Liverpool, Bristol,\r\nManchester, Glasgow, &c.[37] A few years since the company opened\r\nsubscription rooms in all the large towns of the north, in which\r\nintelligence of every kind was posted immediately after its arrival in\r\nLondon; but the craving for early intelligence was not sufficient to\r\ninduce the people to incur the expense, and, with the exception of the\r\nroom at Hull, the establishments have all been shut up.\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening especially this department is very busy condensing for\r\nthe country papers the news which appears in that exciting column headed\r\n\"By Electric Telegraph, London, 2 A.M.\" Thus the telegraph rides express\r\nthrough the night for the broadsheets of the entire kingdom, and even\r\nsteps across from Portpatrick to Donaghadee into the sister country, with\r\nits budget of latest intelligence, by which means the extremities of the\r\ntwo islands are kept as well _up_ in the progress of important events as\r\nLondon itself. Upwards of 120 provincial papers each receive in this\r\nmanner their column of parliamentary news of the night; and the _Daily\r\nMail_, published in Glasgow, gets sometimes as much as three columns of\r\nthe debates forwarded whilst the House is sitting. A superintendent and\r\nfour clerks are expressly employed in this department; and early in the\r\nday, towards the end of the week, the office presents all the appearance\r\nof an editor's room. At seven in the morning the clerks are to be seen\r\ndeep in the _Times_ and other daily papers, just hot from the press,\r\nmaking extracts, and condensing into short paragraphs all the most\r\nimportant events, which are immediately sent off to the country papers to\r\nform \"second editions.\" Neither does the work cease here; for no sooner is\r\na second edition published in town, than its news, if of more than\r\nordinary interest, is transmitted to the provinces. For instance: whilst\r\nwe were in the company's telegraph room a short time since, the following\r\nintelligence was being served out to Liverpool, York, Manchester, Leeds,\r\nBristol, Birmingham, and Hull:--\r\n\r\n    \"EASTERN WAR--BATTLE ON THE DANUBE--FROM EVENING EDITION OF THE\r\n    'MORNING CHRONICLE.'\r\n\r\n    \"_Vienna, Saturday, April 8th._\r\n\r\n    \"The journal _Fremden Blatt_ announces, under date of Bucharest, 4th\r\n    April, that a great battle was being fought at Rassova, about midway\r\n    between Hirsova and Silistria, in the Dobrudscha. The result was not\r\n    known. Mustapha Pasha is at the head of 50,000 men.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at the above-mentioned places, swifter than a rocket could fly the\r\ndistance, like a rocket it bursts, and is again carried by the diverging\r\nwires into a dozen neighbouring towns. The announcement we have quoted\r\ncomes opportunely to remind us that intelligence thus hastily gathered and\r\ntransmitted has also its drawbacks, and is not so trustworthy as the news\r\nwhich starts later and travels slower. The \"great battle of Rassova\" has\r\nnot yet been fought, and the general action announced through the\r\ntelegraph was only a sanguinary skirmish.\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic organization of London, meagre as it is at present, would\r\nform alone a curious paper: \"a province covered with houses,\" it demands a\r\nspecial arrangement, and accordingly we see day by day new branches opened\r\nwithin its precincts, by which means every part of the metropolis is being\r\nput in communication with the country and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe branch stations are, London Docks (main entrance); No. 43, Mincing\r\nLane; General Post Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand; No. 30, Fleet Street;\r\nNo. 448, West Strand; No. 17_a_, Great George Street, Westminster; No. 89,\r\nSt. James's Street; No. 1, Park Side, Knightsbridge; No. 6, Edgeware Road;\r\nGreat Western Railway Station; London and North-Western Railway Station;\r\nGreat Northern Railway Station; Highbury Railway Station; Eastern\r\nCounties' Railway Station; Blackwall Railway Station; London and Brighton\r\nand South Coast Railway Station; and the London and South-Western Railway\r\nStation; of these only two are open night and day. The central office,\r\nstrange as it might appear, is closed at half-past 8 o'clock P.M., and its\r\nwires are put in connection with those at the Charing Cross Station, which\r\ntakes upon itself the night work--a singular proof, by the way, that\r\nLondon proper is deserted shortly after the hours of business are over.\r\nThe Eastern Counties' office is also open at night, and forms the East End\r\noffice of the company. These stations communicate with the central office\r\nin Lothbury, and form, in fact, direct feeders to it, just as the hundred\r\nsuckers do to the zoophyte.\r\n\r\nWe have yet, however, to notice the special telegraphic communication\r\nwhich exists in the metropolis between place and place, either for\r\ngovernmental purposes or for social convenience. The most curious of these\r\nlines is the wire between the Octagon Hall in the new Houses of Parliament\r\nand the St. James's Street Commercial station. They should name this line\r\nfrom the \"whipper-in\" of the House, for it is nothing more than a\r\ncall-wire for members. The company employ reporters during the sitting of\r\nParliament, to make an abstract from the gallery of the business of the\r\ntwo Houses as it proceeds; and this abstract is forwarded, at very short\r\nintervals, to the office in St. James's Street, where _it is set up and\r\nprinted_, additions being made to the sheet issued as the MS. comes in.\r\nThis flying sheet is posted half-hourly to the following clubs and\r\nestablishments:--Arthur's; Carlton; Oxford and Cambridge; Brook's;\r\nConservative; United Service; Athenæum; Reform; Traveller's; United\r\nUniversity; Union; and White's; hourly to Boodle's Club and Prince's Club;\r\nand half-hourly to the Royal Italian Opera. The shortest possible abstract\r\nis of course supplied--just sufficient, in fact, to enable the\r\nafter-dinner M.P. so to economize his proceedings as to be able to finish\r\nhis claret, and yet be in time for the ministerial statement, or to count\r\nin the division.\r\n\r\nThe wire to the Opera is a still more curious example of the social\r\nservices the new power is destined to perform. An abstract of the\r\nproceedings of Parliament, similar to the above, but in _writing_, is\r\nposted, during the performance, in the lobby; and Young England has only\r\nto lounge out between the acts to know if Disraeli or Lord John Russell is\r\nup, and whether he may sit out the piece, or must hasten down to\r\nWestminster. The Opera House even communicates with the Strand Office, so\r\nthat messages may be sent from thence to all parts of the kingdom. The\r\nGovernment wires go from Somerset House to the Admiralty, and thence to\r\nPortsmouth and Plymouth by the South-Western and Great Western Railways;\r\nand these two establishments are put in communication, by means of\r\nsubterranean lines, with the naval establishments at Deptford, Woolwich,\r\nChatham, Sheerness, and with the Cinque Ports of Deal and Dover. They are\r\nworked quite independently of the Company, and the messages are sent in\r\ncipher, the meaning of which is unknown, even to the telegraphic clerks\r\nemployed in transmitting it. In addition to the wires already spoken of,\r\nstreet branches run from Buckingham Palace and Scotland Yard (the head\r\npolice-office) to the station at Charing Cross, and thence on to Founder's\r\nCourt; whilst the Post-office, Lloyd's, Capel Court, and the Corn Exchange\r\ncommunicate directly with the Central Office.\r\n\r\nThe function, then, of the Central Office is to receive and redistribute\r\ncommunications. Of the manner in which these ends are accomplished nothing\r\ncan be gained from a glance round the instrument-rooms. You see no wires\r\ncoming into or emerging from them; you ask for a solution of the mystery,\r\nand one of the clerks leads you to the staircase and opens the door of\r\nwhat looks like a long wooden shoot placed perpendicularly against the\r\nwall. This is the great spinal cord of the establishment, consisting of a\r\nvast bundle of wires, insulated from each other by gutta percha. One set\r\nof these conveys the gathered-up streams of intelligence from the remote\r\nends of the continent and the farthest shores of Britain, conducts them\r\nthrough London by the street lines underneath the thronging footsteps of\r\nthe multitude, and ascends with its invisible despatches directly to the\r\ndifferent instruments. Another set is composed of the wires that descend\r\ninto the battery-chamber. It is impossible to realize the fact by merely\r\ngazing upon this brown and dusty-looking bundle of threads; nevertheless\r\nso it is, that they put us in communication with no less than 4,409 miles\r\nof telegraph, which is coterminous with the railway system of the island,\r\nand forms a complete network over its entire surface, with the exception\r\nof the highlands of North Wales. It penetrates already into the wilds of\r\nScotland, as we see the wire is carried on from Aberdeen to Balmoral.\r\n\r\nThe physiologist, minutely dissecting the star-fish, shows us its nervous\r\nsystem extending to the tip of each limb, and descants upon the beauty of\r\nthis arrangement, by which the central mouth is informed of the nutriment\r\nwithin its reach. The telegraphic system, already developed in England,\r\nhas rendered her as sensitive, to the utmost extremities, as the\r\nstar-fish. Day by day and hour by hour everything that happens of\r\nimportance is immediately referred to its centre at Lothbury, and this\r\ncentre returns the service by spreading the information afresh in every\r\ndirection. Thus, should an enemy appear off our coast, his presence, by\r\nthe aid of the fibre, is immediately felt at the Admiralty, and an\r\nimmediate reply sends out the fleet in chase. Should a riot occur in the\r\nmanufacturing districts, the local authorities communicate with the Home\r\nOffice, and orders are sent down to put the distant troops in motion. Does\r\na murderer escape, the same wire makes the fact known to Scotland Yard,\r\nand from thence word is sent to the distant policemen to intercept him in\r\nhis flight. The arm is scarcely uplifted quicker to ward off a sudden\r\nblow--the eye does not close with more rapidity upon an unexpected flood\r\nof light, than, by the aid of the telegraph, actions follow upon\r\nimpressions conveyed along the length and breadth of the land. But, says\r\nour reader, suppose these wires should be severed or damaged, your whole\r\nline is paralyzed; and how are you to find out where the fault may be?\r\nAgainst these eventualities human foresight has provided: by testing from\r\nstation to station along the line, the office soon knows how far the wires\r\nare perfect; and if the breach of continuity should be in the subterranean\r\nstreet wires, there are iron testing-posts at every 500 yards distance, by\r\nthe aid of which the workman knows where to make his repairs. Whilst all\r\nis being made right again, however, a curious contrivance is brought into\r\nplay, in order to keep the communication open. Every one is acquainted\r\nwith the action of the railway \"switch,\" by which a train is enabled to\r\nleave one line of rails and run on to another. The telegraph has its\r\nswitch also, and thus a message can be transferred from one line to\r\nanother, or can be sent right _throuyh_ to any locality, without making a\r\nstoppage at the usual resting-place on its way. By this device, then, the\r\n\"sick wires\" can be altogether avoided. Suppose, for instance, that some\r\naccident had happened to the direct Bristol line, and it would not work in\r\nconsequence, then the clerk at the Lothbury station would signal to\r\nBirmingham to switch the wire through to Bristol, or, in other words, to\r\nput him in communication with that place; this done, the message would fly\r\nalong the North-Western line, look in at the Birmingham station, and\r\nimmediately be off down the Midland wire to Bristol, arriving, to all\r\nperception, in the same latitude as quickly as though it had gone direct\r\nby the Great Western wire. Every large station is provided with a\r\nswitching apparatus, and the Lothbury office has several. Here also there\r\nis a very curious contrivance called the \"testing-box,\" which enables the\r\nmanipulator to connect any number of batteries to a wire, in order to give\r\nextra power, without going into the battery vault.\r\n\r\nThese switches, testing, and battery boxes are of great service in certain\r\nconditions of the atmosphere. For instance, a thunderstorm, or more often\r\na fog, will now and then so affect the conducting power of a wire, working\r\nthrough a long distance, that it is found impossible to send a message\r\nalong it, in which case the clerk \"dodges\" the passing storm or fog by\r\nswitching the dispatch round the country through a fine-weather wire. If\r\nhowever the foggy weather should continue, the manipulator has only to go\r\nto the battery box and couple on one or more batteries, just as fresh\r\nengines are put on a train going up an incline when the rails are\r\n\"greasy.\" By thus increasing the power of the electric current the message\r\nis driven through the worst weather. Sometimes as many as six or eight\r\n24-plate batteries are necessary to speed a signal to Glasgow. The more\r\ngeneral way in such cases, however, is to transmit the dispatch to some\r\nintermediate station, where the message is repeated.\r\n\r\nLet us now descend into the battery vaults--two long narrow chambers,\r\nsituated in the basement of the building. Who would think that in this\r\nquiet place, night and day, a power was being generated that exerted its\r\ninfluence to the very margin of this seagirt isle, nay, invaded the\r\nterritories of Holland, Belgium, and France? Who would think that those\r\nlong dusty boxes on the shelves were making scores of iron tongues wag\r\nhundreds of miles off? There are upwards of sixty Daniel's batteries in\r\nfull employment in these vaults. They are ranked as sixes, twelves, and\r\ntwenty-fours, according to the number of their elements or plates; and\r\njust like guns, the higher they rank the further they carry. The powerful\r\ntwenty-fours work the long ranges of wire, and the smaller batteries the\r\nshorter circuits. Of course some of these batteries have harder work to do\r\nthan others, and the \"twenty-fours\" working the North-Western line have\r\nmuch the busiest time of it. Considering the work done by them, their\r\nmaintenance is not very costly. A twenty-four, when in full work, does not\r\nconsume its zinc plates under three months, and a gill of sulphuric acid,\r\ndiluted, is its strong but rather moderate allowance of liquid per month.\r\nOther batteries of the same force are satisfied with 1 lb. of sulphate of\r\ncopper per month, with a little sulphate of zinc, and salt and water. The\r\nentire amount of electric power employed by the Company throughout the\r\ncountry is produced by 8000 12-plate batteries, or 96,000 cells, which are\r\nlined with 1,500,000 square inches of copper, and about the same of zinc.\r\nTo work these batteries six tons of acid is yearly consumed, and\r\nfifty-five tons of sand; the principal use of the latter is to prevent the\r\nchemicals from slopping about, and the metal plates from getting oxidised\r\ntoo rapidly. The language of the \"wire,\" with respect to the working of\r\nthe telegraph, is very curious. For instance, when a distant station-clerk\r\nfinds that a battery is not up to its work, by the weak action of the\r\nneedles, he sends word that it requires \"refreshment,\" and it is\r\naccordingly served with its gill of aquafortis, and, totally opposed to\r\nthe doctrines of temperance, a \"long-lived battery\" owes its vitality to\r\nthe strongest drink.\r\n\r\nWe have followed the wires down to one pole of their respective\r\nbatteries, and now we have to pursue them out of the opposite pole until\r\nthey take to \"earth.\" No electricity will flow from the positive pole Z of\r\nthe battery (Fig. 2) unless the wire D K A B is connected, either by being\r\nitself unbroken, or by the interposition of some other conductor where a\r\ngap occurs, to the negative pole C. In the earlier telegraphs it was usual\r\nto have a return-wire to effect this purpose. But, strange as it may\r\nsound, it was discovered that the earth itself would convey the current\r\nback to the negative pole, and thus an entire length of wire was saved.\r\nAccordingly the earth completes the two hundred and odd different\r\ncircuits, which pass their loops, as it were, through the central office.\r\nIn order to get a \"good earth\" a hole was dug deep in the foundations,\r\nuntil some moist ground was found, _dry_ soil being a very bad conductor,\r\nand into this a cylinder of copper, four inches in diameter and 40 lbs. in\r\nweight, was sunken, surrounded by a mass of sulphate of copper in\r\ncrystals. All the earth wires of the establishment were then put in\r\nconnection with this mass of metal, or earth plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nThe non-scientific reader will perhaps require a figure to explain to him\r\nour meaning, when we say that the earth is capable of completing the\r\n\"circuit.\" In the accompanying diagram (No. 6) we have a battery, U V, in\r\nthe central office in London, deflecting a needle N, say in Liverpool. The\r\nfluid passes from the positive pole of the battery U, traverses the wire\r\nof the North-Western Railway, and after working the telegraph in\r\nLiverpool, descends into the earth by the wire B, which has a metal or\r\nearth-plate attached to it. From this point the electric fluid starts\r\nhomewards, through the solid ground, and finding out the earth-plate[38]\r\nunder the foundations at Lothbury, ascends along the wire A, into the\r\nnegative pole of the battery V. By reversing the current, it flows first\r\nthrough the earth from V A to B, and returns by the wire to the opposite\r\npole U.\r\n\r\nNothing in telegraphy impresses the thoughtful mind more than the fact\r\nthat the electric fluid, after spanning, maybe, half the globe, should\r\ncome back to its battery, through adamantine rocks, through seas and all\r\nthe diverse elements which make up the anatomy of the globe. The\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon is still a matter of pure speculation.\r\nIndeed, it may be objected that our flight of the electric principle is\r\naltogether a flight of fancy--that there is in fact no flow of electricity\r\nat all, but that its progress through bodies, according to the generally\r\nreceived theory, is owing to opposite poles of contiguous particles acting\r\nupon each other. The hypothesis, however, first received in science gives\r\nbirth to its language, which usually continues the same, although it may\r\nhave ceased to be an adequate expression of the current doctrine of\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nThe traveller, as he flies along in the train, and looks out upon the\r\nwires which seem stretched against the sky like the ledger lines of music,\r\nlittle dreams of these invisible conductors that are returning the current\r\nthrough the ground. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, indeed, the\r\nwires and their sustaining posts represent to the spectator the entire\r\ntelegraph. The following conversation between two navigators, overheard\r\nthe other day by a friend, gives the most popular view of the way the\r\ntelegraph works. \"I say, Jem, how do 'em _jaw_ along them wires?\" \"Why,\r\nBill, they pulls at one end, and rings a bell at t'other.\" Others again\r\nfancy that messages are conveyed by means of the vibrations of the metal,\r\nfor on windy days they sometimes give out sounds like an Æolian harp: a\r\nfact which, according to Sir Francis Head, called forth the remark from a\r\nNorth-Western driver to his stoker, \"I say, Bill, aint they a giving it to\r\n'em at Thrapstone?\" The more ignorant class of people actually believe\r\nthat it conveys parcels and letters, and they sometimes carry them for\r\ntransmission to the office.\r\n\r\nIron wire, coated with zinc, or \"galvanised,\" as it is termed, to prevent\r\nits rusting, is now universally used as the conductor of the electric\r\nfluid when the lines are suspended in the air. The first rain falling upon\r\nthe zinc converts it into an oxide of that metal, which is insoluble in\r\nwater, so that henceforth in pure air it cannot be acted upon by that\r\nelement, and all further oxidation ceases. Mr. Highton says, however, that\r\nin the neighbourhood of large manufacturing towns the sulphur from the\r\nsmoky atmosphere converts the oxide into a sulphate of zinc, which is\r\nsoluble, and consequently the rain continually washes it off the wire. He\r\nasserts that he has had wires in this manner reduced from the eighth of an\r\ninch to the diameter of a common sewing-needle. There has been a great\r\ncontroversy as to the best means of insulating the wires from their\r\nsupporting-poles, which would otherwise convey the electricity from the\r\nwires to the earth. There is no method known of effecting this completely,\r\nbut we believe it is now decided that stoneware is the best material for\r\nthe purpose, both on account of its non-conducting qualities, and the\r\nreadiness with which it throws off from its surface particles of water.\r\nThe latter quality is extremely important, for, in very rainy weather, if\r\nthe insulator should happen to get wet, the electric fluid will sometimes\r\nmake a bridge of the moisture to quit the wire, run down the post to the\r\nearth, and make a short circuit home again to its battery. Indeed, when\r\nthere are many wires suspended to the same pole on the same plane, a\r\ndripping stream of water falling from an upper to a lower one will often\r\nsuffice to return the current before it has done its work, much to the\r\ntelegraphist's annoyance. Not long ago, a mishap, having similar\r\nconsequences, occurred on the line between Lewes and Newhaven, owing to\r\nthe following very singular circumstance: a crane, in its flight through\r\nthe rain, came in contact with the wires, and having threaded his long\r\nneck completely through them, the current made a short cut along his damp\r\nfeathers to the wire below, and by this channel home. Moisture, however,\r\nmuch as it may interfere for a time with the working of a line, rarely\r\ndoes any permanent injury. Lightning, on the contrary if not guarded\r\nagainst, is capable of producing great mischief. It has been known to\r\nstrike and run for miles along a wire, and, in its course, to enter\r\nstation after station, and melt the delicate coils and the finer portions\r\nof the instruments into solid masses. In most cases it reverses the\r\npolarity of the needles, or renders permanent the magnetism of the\r\nelectro-magnets. All these dangerous and annoying contingencies are easily\r\navoided by the application of a simple conducting-apparatus to lead away\r\nthe unwelcome visitor. The method adopted by Mr. Highton is to line a\r\nsmall deal box, say ten or twelve inches long, with a tin plate, and to\r\nput this plate in connection with the earth. The wire bound up in bibulous\r\npaper--which is a sufficient insulator for the low-tensioned fluid of the\r\nbattery--is carried, before it enters the instrument, through the centre\r\nof the box, and is surrounded with iron fillings. The high-tensioned\r\nelectricity of the lightning instantly darts from the wire, through the\r\npores of the paper, to the million points of the finely-divided iron, and\r\nso escapes to the earth. There are, of course, many kinds of lightning\r\nconductors used on different lines, but this one is simple in its\r\nconstruction, and, we are given to understand, answers its purpose\r\nexceedingly well.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the Electric Telegraph Company has been established\r\nso many years, it is only just now that the public have begun to\r\nunderstand the use of the \"wire.\" The very high charges at first demanded\r\nfor the transmission of a message, doubtless, made it a luxury rather than\r\na necessary of life; and every reduction of the tariff clearly brought it\r\nwithin the range of a very much larger class of the community, as will be\r\nseen by the following table issued by the Company, which shows the advance\r\nof the system under its management.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     In the       | Miles of|Miles | Number | Receipts. | Dividends paid.\r\n   half-years     |Telegraph| of   |  of    |           |\r\n     ending       |   in    |Wires |Messages|           |\r\n                  |operation|      |        |           |\r\n  ----------------|---------|------|--------|-----------|----------------\r\n                  |         |      |        |  £.  s. d.|\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |\r\n  June, 1850      |  1,684  | 6,730| 29,245 |20,436 10 0|4 per Cent. per\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Ann.\r\n  December, 1850  |  1,786  | 7,200| 37,389 |23,087 13 9|4 per Cent. per\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Ann.\r\n  June, 1851      |  1,965  | 7,900| 47,259 |25,529 12 4|{6 per Ct. per\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Ann.\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |{& 2 per Ct.\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Bonus.\r\n  December, 1851  |  2,122  |10,650| 53,957 |24,336 8 10|6 per Cent. per\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Ann.\r\n    _Note._--In   |         |      |        |           |\r\n    this half-year|         |      |        |           |\r\n    the paid-up   |         |      |        |           |\r\n    Capital of the|         |      |        |           |\r\n    Company was   |         |      |        |           |\r\n    increased, and|         |      |        |           |\r\n    the tariff    |         |      |        |           |\r\n    diminished    |         |      |        |           |\r\n    about 50 per  |         |      |        |           |\r\n    Cent. from the|         |      |        |           |\r\n    original rate |         |      |        |           |\r\n    of charge.    |         |      |        |           |\r\n  June, 1852      |  2,502  |12,500| 87,150 |27,437  4 8|6 per Cent. per\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Ann.\r\n  December, 1852  |  3,709  |19,560|127,987 |40,087 18 2|6-1/2 per Cent.\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  per Ann.\r\n  June, 1853      |  4,008  |20,800|138,060 |47,265 16 3|6-1/2 per Cent.\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  per Ann.\r\n  December, 1853  |  4,409  |24,340|212,440 |56,919  0 1|7 per Cent. per\r\n                  |         |      |        |           |  Ann.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above what an impulse was given to the business\r\nby the reduction in the tariff which took place in December, 1851; for if\r\nwe compare the messages of the half-year ending June, 1850, with those of\r\nthe half-year of June, 1852, we shall find that whilst the miles of\r\ntelegraph in work had not increased one-half, the messages transmitted had\r\nnearly trebled. It is only within this last year or two, however--as will\r\nbe seen by the table--that a very large augmentation of business has taken\r\nplace, which is doubtless owing to the public being better acquainted with\r\nits capabilities. The tariff has since been further reduced, with the\r\nresult of a still further increase of the messages sent and of the money\r\nreceived--the profits allowing, at the present moment, of a seven per\r\ncent. dividend! The lowest point of cheapness, in our opinion, is yet very\r\nfar from being reached; and it would only be a wise act on the part of the\r\nCompany to at once adopt an uniform charge for messages, say of fifty\r\nwords, for one shilling. If this were done, the only limit to its business\r\nwould be the number of wires they could conveniently hang, for the present\r\nset would clearly be insufficient. Means should also be taken to obviate\r\none great objection, at present felt, with respect to sending private\r\ncommunications by telegraph--the violation of all secrecy,--for in any\r\ncase half a dozen people must be cognizant of every word addressed by one\r\nperson to another. The clerks of the English Electric Telegraph Company\r\nare sworn to secrecy, but we often write things that it would be\r\nintolerable to see strangers read before our eyes. This is a grievous\r\nfault in the telegraph, and it _must_ be remedied by some means or other.\r\nOur own opinion is that the public would much prefer the dial telegraph,\r\nby the use of which two persons could converse with each other, without\r\nthe intervention of a third party at all--or the printing step by step\r\ninstrument would be equally good. At all events, some simple yet secure\r\ncipher, easily acquired and easily read, should be introduced, by which\r\nmeans messages might to all intents and purposes be \"sealed\" to any person\r\nexcept the recipient. We have reason to believe that Professor Wheatstone\r\nhas invented a cipher of this description, which will speedily be made\r\npublic. \"One-eighth of the despatches between New Orleans and New York,\"\r\nsays Mr. Jones in his \"Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph,\" \"are\r\nin cipher. For instance, merchants in either city agree upon a cipher, and\r\nif the New Orleans correspondent wishes to inform his New York friend of\r\nthe prices and prospects of the cotton market, instead of saying 'Cotton\r\neight quarter--don't sell,' he may use the\r\nfollowing:--'Shepherd--rum--kiss--flash--dog.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Company has lately made an arrangement, by which the very absurd and\r\ninconvenient necessity of being obliged to attend personally at the\r\ntelegraph station with a message has been obviated. \"Franked message\r\npapers,\" pre-paid, are now issued, procurable at any stationers'. These,\r\nwith the message filled in, can be dispatched to the office when and how\r\nthe sender likes, and the Company intend very quickly to sell electric\r\nstamps, like Queen's heads, which may be stuck on to any piece of paper,\r\nand frank its contents without further trouble. Another very important\r\narrangement for mercantile men is the sending of \"remittance messages,\" by\r\nmeans of which money can be paid in at the central office in London, and,\r\nwithin a few minutes, paid out at Liverpool or Manchester, or by the same\r\nmeans sent up to town with the like dispatch from Liverpool, Manchester,\r\nBristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Hull,\r\nYork, Plymouth, and Exeter. There is a money-order office in the Lothbury\r\nestablishment to manage this department, which will, no doubt, in all\r\nemergencies speedily supersede the Government money-order office, which\r\nworks through the slower medium of the Post Office.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken hitherto only of the Old Electric Telegraph Company. There\r\nare several other companies in the United Kingdom, working different\r\npatents. We have chosen, however, to describe the proceedings of the\r\noriginal Company, because it is the only one that has an amount of\r\nbusiness sufficient to give it universal interest; it is the only company,\r\nin fact, that has seized the map of England in its nervous grasp, and shot\r\nits wires through every broad English shire. The European and the British\r\nTelegraph Companies have laid their lines, insulated with gutta percha and\r\nprotected by iron tubes, beneath the public roads. The European Company\r\nworks between Manchester, Birmingham, London, and Dover, and, by means of\r\nthe two submarine cables of Dover and Calais and Dover and Ostend, puts\r\nthe great manufacturing and commercial emporiums in connection with\r\nFrance, Belgium, and the rest of Europe by a double route. The British\r\nTelegraph Company works principally in the northern counties. Of the other\r\nlines, we need only mention at present the United Kingdom, and the English\r\nand Irish Magnetic Company, which works wires between London, Belfast, and\r\nGalway, by means of a subterranean line as far as the west coast of\r\nScotland, and of a submarine cable stretched between Portpatrick and\r\nDonaghadee.\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, be a source of wonder to our readers that one company\r\nshould virtually possess the monopoly of telegraphic communication in this\r\ncountry, but this will cease when they consider that this Company was the\r\nfirst to enter the field, that it came forward with a large capital,\r\nspeedily secured to themselves the different lines of railway--the only\r\npaths it was then considered that telegraphs could traverse with\r\nsecurity,--and that it bought up, one after another, most of the patents\r\nthat stood any chance of competing with its own. The time is fast\r\napproaching, however, when most of these advantages will fail them, and\r\nwhen the Company, powerful as it is, must be prepared to encounter a\r\nsevere and active competition, and that for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n1. The plan of bringing the wires under the public roads turns, as it\r\nwere, the flank of the railroad lines.\r\n\r\n2. The patents of the old company are year by year expiring.\r\n\r\n3. The very large capital expended by it--upwards of 170,000_l._ being\r\nsunk in patent rights alone,--independently of the vast expense attaching\r\nto the first introduction of the invention, forms a dead-weight which no\r\nnew company would have to bear.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of events, then, the other lines at present in\r\nexistence will gain strength; new companies will spring up, and the supply\r\nof a great public want will be thrown into the arena of competition. Would\r\nit not be wise for the legislature to consider the question of telegraphy\r\nin England before it is too late? We all know what the principle of\r\nreckless competition led us into in our railway system. For years opposing\r\ncompanies scrambled for the monopoly of certain districts, and the result\r\nwas the intersection of the country with bad lines, and, in many cases,\r\nwith useless double routes. Millions were spent in litigation; railway\r\ntravelling became, as a natural consequence, dear; the property of the\r\noriginal shareholders rapidly deteriorated; and it has all ended in half a\r\ndozen powerful companies swallowing up the smaller ones; and that\r\ncompetition, in whose name so much was demanded, has turned out to be only\r\n\"a delusion and a snare.\" The conveyance of intelligence cannot safely and\r\nconveniently be left in the hands of even one company without a strict\r\nGovernment supervision; much less can half a dozen systems be allowed to\r\ndistract the land at their own will. Indeed, the question might with\r\npropriety be asked, Is not telegraphic communication as much a function of\r\nGovernment as the conveyance of letters? If the do-nothing principle is\r\nto be allowed to take its course, we shall have to go through a similar\r\nstate of things to that which occurred only a few years since in the\r\nUnited States, when different competing lines refused to forward each\r\nother's messages, and the whole system of telegraphic communication was\r\naccordingly dislocated. Indeed, even with the most perfect accord between\r\ndifferent companies, the dissimilarity of instruments used by them would\r\nprove a great practical evil--as great a one, if not greater, than the\r\nbreak of gauge in the railway system. Messages could not be passed from\r\none line to another, and delays as vexatious as those which occur on the\r\ncontinental lines would take away much of the value of the invention. It\r\nseems to us, then, that even if Parliament should refuse to interfere with\r\nthe principle of competition in the case of the telegraphic communication,\r\nit should, at least, provide for the use of the same kind of instruments,\r\nand make it a fineable offence for one line to refuse to forward the\r\nmessages of another.\r\n\r\nHaving done so much towards completing our telegraphic organization at\r\nhome, our engineers adventurously determined to carry the wires across to\r\nthe continent, and thus destroy the last remnant of that isolation to\r\nwhich we were forced to submit on account of our insular position. As long\r\nback as the year 1840 we find, by the Minutes of Evidence in the Fifth\r\nReport upon Railways, wherein the subject of electric telegraphy was\r\npartially examined, that, whilst Mr. Wheatstone was under examination Sir\r\nJohn Guest asked, \"Have you tried to pass the line through water?\" to\r\nwhich he replied, \"There would be no difficulty in doing so; but the\r\nexperiment has not yet been tried.\" Again, on the chairman, Lord Seymour,\r\nasking, \"Could you communicate from Dover to Calais in that way?\" he\r\nreplied, \"I think it perfectly practicable.\" A couple of years later the\r\nprofessor, indeed, engaged, and had everything in readiness, to lay a line\r\nfor the Government across Portsmouth Harbour; it was not executed,\r\nhowever, through circumstances over which he had no control, but which\r\nwere quite irrespective of the perfect feasibility of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nWe question, however, whether it would have been possible to have\r\naccomplished the feat of crossing the Channel with the electric fire\r\nbefore this date, as the difficulty of insulating the wires, so as to\r\nprevent the water from carrying off the electricity, would, we imagine,\r\nhave been insuperable, but for the happy discovery of gutta percha, which\r\nsupplied the very tough, flexible, non-conducting material the electrician\r\nsought for. Thus it might be said that the instantaneous interchange of\r\nthought between distant nations awaited the discovery of a vegetable\r\nproduction in the dense forests of the Eastern Archipelago. The first\r\napplication of this singular substance to the insulation of electric\r\nconducting wires was made in 1847, by Lieutenant Siémens, of the Prussian\r\nartillery, for a line to cross the Rhine at Cologne.\r\n\r\nThe first submarine wire laid down was that between Dover and Cape\r\nGris-nez, in the vicinity of Calais, belonging to the Submarine Telegraph\r\nCompany. This wire, thirty miles in length, was covered with gutta percha\r\nto the diameter of half an inch, and sunk (August, 1850), as it was paid\r\nout, by the addition of clumps of lead at every sixteenth of a mile. The\r\nwhole was completed and a message sent between the two countries on the\r\nsame day. In the course of a month, however, the cable broke, owing to its\r\nhaving fretted upon a sharp ridge of rocks about a mile from Cape\r\nGris-nez. It was now determined to make a stronger and better-constructed\r\ncable, capable of resisting all friction in this part of the Channel. The\r\nform of cable adopted for this and all other submarine telegraphs now in\r\nexistence seems to have been originally suggested by Messrs. Newall and\r\nCo., of Gateshead, the wellknown wire-rope manufacturers. Instead of one,\r\nfour wires, insulated by the Gutta Percha Company, were twisted together\r\ninto a strand, and next \"served\" or enveloped in spun-yarn. This core was\r\nthen covered with ten iron galvanized wires five-sixteenths of an inch in\r\ndiameter, welded into lengths of twenty-four miles, and forming a flexible\r\nkind of mail. The cable was manufactured in the short space of twenty-one\r\ndays. It weighed 180 tons, and formed a coil in the hold of the old hulk\r\nthat carried it of thirty feet in diameter outside, and fifteen feet\r\ninside, standing five feet high. All went well with the undertaking until\r\nabout one-half had been \"paid out,\" when, a gale arising, unfortunately\r\nthe tug-boat that towed the hulk containing the rope broke away, and\r\nvessel, wire, and all, drifted, with a racing tide, full a mile up the\r\nChannel before it could be overtaken. The consequence was, that the cable\r\nwas violently dragged out of its course in the middle of the straits. What\r\nwas worse, a sharp \"kink,\" or bend, also occurred near the Dover shore,\r\nwhich doubled the cable on itself, but luckily produced no serious damage.\r\nThe \"lie\" of the submarine cable between Dover and the vicinity of Calais,\r\nat this present moment, is expressed in the following diagram:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nWhen the cable at length came near the French coast, it was found to be,\r\nin consequence of this unintentional _detour_, at least half a mile too\r\nshort. This was remedied, however, by splicing on a fresh piece; and, on\r\nsecuring it at Saugat, the new place of landing, fixed upon on account of\r\nits sandy shore, it was found that the communication was good, and good it\r\nhas remained ever since--a proof of the admirable manner in which the\r\nwires were insulated and the cable constructed. The placing of this\r\nsuccessful cable was superintended by Mr. Wollaston, the Company's\r\nengineer, and by Mr. Crampton, the contractor. Mr. Wollaston, who is a\r\nnephew of the illustrious philosopher of the same name, and who also\r\npresided over the earlier attempt, will accordingly, in the annals of\r\nelectricity, carry off the honours of having first laid down the ocean\r\ntelegraph.\r\n\r\nThe same Company, not long afterwards, laid another cable across to\r\nOstend. This established a connection with Europe through Belgium, and was\r\nplanned to prevent this line of communication falling into the hands of\r\nanother company, and was not, as was suspected at the time, a matter of\r\npolitical foresight on the part of the directors, to enable them to carry\r\non their intercourse with the continent, in spite of France, supposing war\r\nshould break out between the two countries. Who would have believed a\r\nshort time since, in Belgium, that the day would come when it would be\r\nquicker to convey intelligence to France by way of England than directly\r\nacross the frontiers? Yet such was actually the case; for, before the line\r\nwas laid by land, it was a thing of very frequent occurrence for\r\ndespatches from Ostend to cross the Channel to Dover by one cable, and to\r\nbe immediately switched across to Calais by the other; thus paying us a\r\nmomentary triangular visit underneath the rapid straits.\r\n\r\nThe notion, however, of preventing competition proved to be vain. A third\r\ncable was laid on the 30th May, 1853, between the English coast at\r\nOrfordness, near Ipswich, and the port of Schevening in Holland, and\r\nthence to the Hague. This cable is the longest at present in connection\r\nwith this isle, extending 120 miles under the turbulent North Sea. It was,\r\nhowever, paid out during a violent gale of wind without the slightest\r\naccident, and affords the most direct means of communication with the\r\nnorth of Europe, and entirely commands the commercial traffic of the\r\ncities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The Hague cable (or cables, for there\r\nare now many, consisting of a single wire conductor each, running side by\r\nside) is the property of the International Company, a branch of the Old\r\nElectric Telegraph, and its wires go direct to the Lothbury office.\r\n\r\nWhilst England has moored her south-eastern shores to the continent by\r\nthree cables, and put herself _en rapport_ with all its principal cities,\r\nher north-western extremity has been secured, after many failures, to the\r\nsister kingdom--the Electro-Magnetic Company having laid a submarine wire\r\nfrom Portpatrick and Donaghadee, in the neighbourhood of Belfast, and the\r\nBritish Electric Telegraph Company another between Portpatrick and\r\nWhitehead in Belfast Lough. England, as befits her, led the way in these\r\nadventures upon the sea with the electric fire, and the Danes, Dutch,\r\nRussians, and others, are now following in her track.\r\n\r\nWill it be believed that in 1841, long after the electric telegraph was\r\nworking in England, scientific men were seriously discussing in the French\r\nChamber the propriety of establishing a night telegraph on the visual\r\nprinciple, and that when at length it was determined to call in the aid of\r\nelectricity, instruments were ordered to be so constructed that signals\r\ncould be given after the fashion of the old semaphore, in order that the\r\nofficials might be spared the trouble of leaving their ancient ruts? The\r\nneedles were accordingly displaced for a mimic post, to which moveable\r\narms were attached and signs were transmitted by elevating or depressing\r\nthem by electricity, instead of by hand. Of course this absurd system was\r\nafter a while abolished, and the instrument now made use of is a\r\nmodification of the dial telegraph constructed by Breguet. The first\r\ntelegraph planted in France was constructed by Mr. Wheatstone, from Paris\r\nto Versailles, in 1842. The principal line is that running from Calais\r\n_viâ_ Paris to Marseilles, which puts the English Channel and the\r\nMediterranean in communication, and transmits for us the more urgent items\r\nof the India and China mail.\r\n\r\nBelgium and Switzerland are perhaps the best supplied of all the\r\ncontinental kingdoms with telegraphic communication. The Belgian lines\r\nwere excellently planned and cheaply constructed, consequently their\r\ntariff is comparatively low, the average charge for a message being 3\r\nfrancs 48 centimes, or about 2_s._ 10-1/2_d._ Of the nature of the\r\nmessages sent we can form a very good idea by the following classification\r\nof a hundred dispatches:--\r\n\r\n  Government          2\r\n  Stock-jobbing      50\r\n  Commercial         31\r\n  Newspaper           4\r\n  Family affairs     13\r\n                   ----\r\n                    100\r\n\r\nA comparison of the average division of messages in every state would\r\nafford a very fair index of the nature of the occupations of their\r\npeoples. We have attempted to obtain materials for this purpose in vain;\r\nforeign governments, as well as English companies, being very jealous of\r\ngiving any information relative to their messages. The history of the\r\ntelegraph in Switzerland is an evidence of what patriotic feeling is\r\ncapable of accomplishing. Although by far the best and most extensive, for\r\na mountainous country, in the world, it was constructed by the spontaneous\r\nefforts of the people. The peasantry gave their free labour towards\r\nerecting the wires and poles, the landlords found the timber and gave the\r\nright of way over their lands, and the communes provided station room in\r\nthe towns. Thus the telegraph was completed, so to speak, for nothing. The\r\npeculiarity of the Swiss telegraph is that, like the great wall of China,\r\nit proceeds totally regardless of the nature of the ground. It climbs the\r\npass of the Simplon in proceeding from Geneva to Milan; it goes over St.\r\nGothard in its way from Lucerne to Como: it mounts the Splugen, and again\r\nit goes from Feldkirch to Inspruck by the Arlberg pass, thus ascending the\r\ngreat chain of the Alps as though it were only a gentle hillside. The\r\nwires course along the lakes of Lucerne, Zug, Zurich, and Constance;\r\nsometimes they are nailed to precipices, sometimes they make short cuts\r\nover unfrequented spurs of the mountains, going every way, in short, that\r\nit is found most convenient to hang them. The completion of the\r\ntelegraphic system of this little republic, which stands in the same\r\nrelation to Southern as Belgium does to Northern Europe, was of great\r\nconsequence, as it forms the keystone between France, Prussia, Austria,\r\nPiedmont, and Italy.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia the lines are insulated in gutta percha, and buried in the\r\nground in leaden tubes, a very costly process, but with many great\r\nadvantages, in freedom from injury and atmospheric influences, over the\r\nmore usual method of suspending them in the air on poles. Upwards of 4,000\r\nmiles of wire have already been laid down in this kingdom. Although\r\nAustria only commenced operations in 1847, she already possesses 4,000\r\nmiles of telegraph, which puts the greater part of her extensive empire\r\nin communication with Vienna.\r\n\r\nWhatever injury the Eastern war might have inflicted upon the world, it at\r\nleast infused fresh vigour into the telegraphic system, as, independently\r\nof the lines planned to put Constantinople in communication with the\r\nDanubian frontier, Russia has been stimulated to complete a line between\r\nSt. Petersburg and Helsingfors, in the Baltic, and a continuation of the\r\nline already extending from the capital to Moscow, down to Bucharest,\r\nOdessa, and Sebastopol. One feature distinguishes the management of\r\ncontinental telegraphs over those of England and America: they are all,\r\nwith the exception of the short line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven,\r\npossessed and worked by the different governments, who seem afraid of the\r\nuse they might be put to for political purposes, and accordingly exercise\r\na strict surveillance over all messages sent, and rigidly interdict the\r\nuse of a cipher.[39] The Anglo-Saxon race, however, has far surpassed any\r\nother in the energy with which it has woven the globe with telegraphic\r\nwires. The Americans in the West and the British in the East alike emulate\r\neach other in the magnitude of their undertakings of this nature. The\r\nUnited States, although she came into the field long after England--her\r\nfirst line from Washington to Baltimore not having been completed until\r\n1844--has far outstripped the mother country in the length of her lines,\r\nwhich already extend over 16,729 miles. Every portion of the Union, with\r\nthe exception of California and the upper portion of the Mississippi, is\r\ncovered with a network of wire.\r\n\r\nNew York and New Orleans communicate with each other by a double\r\nroute--one skirting the seacoast, the other taking an inland direction by\r\nCincinnati. These lines alone, following the sinuosities of their routes,\r\nare upwards of 2,000 miles in length.\r\n\r\nOther lines extend as far as Quebec, in Upper Canada, so that messages may\r\nbe forwarded in the course of a couple of hours from the freezing north to\r\nthe burning south. The great chain of lakes which form the northern\r\nboundary of the Union is put in communication with the Missouri and\r\nMississippi rivers, and the great valley traversed by the latter will, ere\r\nlong, interchange messages with the Pacific coast,--Congress having under\r\nits consideration a plan to establish a telegraph across the continent to\r\nSan Francisco, as the precursor of the proposed railroad.\r\n\r\nThis we suspect is the project of Mr. O'Reilly, the engineer who has\r\nalready executed the boldest lines in America. In constructing such a\r\nline, man, not nature, is the great obstacle to be encountered. The\r\nimplacable Indians inhabiting this portion of the States certainly would\r\nnot pay any respect to the telegraphic wire; on the contrary, they would\r\nin all likelihood take it to bind on the heads of their scalping\r\ntomahawks. To provide against this contingency, it is proposed to station\r\nparties of twenty dragoons at stockades twenty miles apart, along the\r\nwhole unprotected portion of the route; two or three of these soldiers are\r\nalso to ride from post to post and carry a daily express letter across the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nWhen this project is executed, it is asserted that \"European news may be\r\npublished in six days on the American shores of the Pacific, on the\r\nshortened route between the old and new world.\" \"The shortened route,\" it\r\nshould be mentioned, lies between Cape Race, in Newfoundland, and Galway,\r\nin Ireland, a passage calculated to take, on the average, only five days.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how is it that such lengths of wire, carried through\r\nthinly settled parts of the country, and sometimes through howling\r\nwildernesses, can pay? The only manner that we can account for it is the\r\ncheapness with which the telegraph is built in America, the average price\r\nbeing 150 dollars, or about 31_l._ a mile--less than a fourth part of the\r\ncost at which the early lines of the English Electric Telegraph Company\r\nwere erected. Again, the low prices charged for the transmission of\r\nmessages produce an amount of business which the lines running through\r\nthickly-inhabited England cannot boast. For instance, let us take the\r\nfollowing advertised \"specimen message,\" of the latter Company, and\r\ncompare the price charged for it here, with what it could be sent for in\r\nAmerica:--\r\n\r\n    \"From             To\r\n      James Smith,      S. R. Brown,\r\n        London,           Exchange,\r\n                            Liverpool.\r\n\r\n    \"I will meet you at Birmingham to-morrow, 3 P.M. Don't fail me.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the London charge for the above, if forwarded to Liverpool, would be\r\n2s. 6d.; but the American tariff for the same, on the Louisville and\r\nPittsburgh rail, would be only one cent a word, or sixpence halfpenny\r\nEnglish. On very long distances our friends on the other side of the steam\r\nferry have a still greater advantage over us: for instance, a message of\r\nten words can be sent on O'Reilly's line, from New York to New Orleans, a\r\ndistance of 2,000 miles, for sixty cents, or two and sixpence--not half\r\nthe sum it would cost to send the same message from London to Edinburgh,\r\nabout 500 miles. We give, as a curiosity, the scale of prices on this\r\nline:[40]--\r\n\r\n                                     Per word.\r\n   200 miles or under                 1 cent.\r\n   500   \"   or over 300 miles        2 cents.\r\n   700   \"      \"    500   \"          3   \"\r\n  1000   \"      \"    700   \"          4   \"\r\n  1500   \"      \"   1000   \"          5   \"\r\n  2000   \"      \"   1500   \"          6   \"\r\n\r\nThese charges, it is true, are unusually low; but if they will pay one\r\nCompany, why should they not another? There are as many as twenty\r\nTelegraph Companies in America, and consequently there is great\r\ncompetition, three or four competing lines in many cases running between\r\nthe same towns. Great confusion has arisen from this competition, as we\r\nhave before stated; but it cannot be doubted that prices have materially\r\nfallen in consequence. It is common to send a message 1,000 miles in the\r\nUnited States without its being read and repeated at intermediate\r\nstations; and brother Jonathan boasts that he can communicate in fine\r\nweather instantaneously between New York and New Orleans. This, if done at\r\nall, must be at the expense of enormous battery power, as 2,000 miles of\r\nNo. 8 wire would expose a conducting surface of no less than 450,000\r\nsquare feet to the air. The wires in America are all suspended upon poles,\r\nand those passing through the southern pine forests are in consequence\r\nparticularly liable to injury from the falling of trees, and watchers are\r\nposted at every twenty miles' distance to patrol the line. The telegraph\r\nis rarely seen in America running beside the railway, for what reason we\r\ndo not know; the consequence, however, is, that locomotion in the United\r\nStates is vastly more dangerous than with us. A comparison of the\r\ncasualties occurring on railroads in the two countries, in the year 1852,\r\nwill show this at a glance; for in the State of New York alone, during\r\nthat year, 228 persons were killed out of 7,440,053 travellers, whilst\r\nduring the same period only 216 people perished in Great Britain out of a\r\ntotal number of 89,135,729 passengers: thus the average in America was 1\r\nkilled in 286,179, and in Great Britain 1 in 2,785,491! Of course property\r\nsuffers in an equal degree with life on the American lines. The people of\r\nBoston, on the recommendation of Dr. Channing, have constructed a\r\nmunicipal telegraph, the many uses of which will be obvious. Mr. Alexander\r\nJones, in his historical sketch of the electric telegraph in America,\r\ngives the following account of the application of the electric wire in\r\ncases of fire:--\r\n\r\n    \"A central office or station is fixed upon, at which the main battery,\r\n    with other instruments, is placed. From this two circuit-wires\r\n    proceed, like those of the common telegraph wires, fastened to\r\n    housetops or ingeniously insulated supports. One of the wires\r\n    communicates from the main fire bell-tower to all the others, and\r\n    connects each with machinery, which puts in motion the largest-sized\r\n    hammer, and causes it to strike a large fire-bell the desired number\r\n    of blows; the other wire proceeds on a still more circuitous route,\r\n    and from one local street or ward signal-station to another. Each\r\n    station is provided with a strong box and hinged door and lock. Inside\r\n    of this box there is a connecting electro-magnet and connecting lever,\r\n    an axle with a number of pins in it to correspond to the number of the\r\n    station. The axle is turned by a short crank, and in its revolutions\r\n    the pins break and close the circuit, by moving the end of the lever\r\n    as often as there are pins or cogs, the result of which is\r\n    communicated to the central station. If the alarm indicates a fire in\r\n    the local district No. 3, the alarm can be instantly rung on all the\r\n    bells in the city. If it is a subject requiring the speedy and\r\n    efficient attention of the police, information by alarms can be given\r\n    at each police-station, or the despatches can be recorded by\r\n    instruments at each place. The local street alarm-boxes are placed in\r\n    the charge of a person whose duty it is to give the alarm from the\r\n    local to the central station, when called upon, or circumstances\r\n    require him to do so.\"\r\n\r\nCanada has also sketched out a plan of telegraphs, which every year will\r\nsee filled up. Already she has lines connecting all her principal towns,\r\nand extending over nearly two thousand miles of country, all of which lock\r\nin with the American system.\r\n\r\nIn India, Dr. O'Shaughnessy has for some time been engaged in carrying out\r\na telegraphic system proposed by Lord Dalhousie, and approved by the East\r\nIndia Company, which has already put all the important towns of the\r\npeninsula in communication with the seat of government and with each\r\nother. The fine No. 8 galvanized iron wire, which in Europe runs along\r\nfrom pole to pole, like a delicate harp-string, is discarded in this\r\ncountry for rods of iron three-eighths of an inch in thickness. The nature\r\nof the climate, and the character of its animal life, has caused this\r\ndeparture from the far more economical European plan. Clouds of kites and\r\ntroops of monkeys would speedily take such liberties with the fine wires\r\nas to place them _hors-de-combat_. Again, the deluges of rain which occur\r\nin the wet season would render the insulation of a small wire so imperfect\r\nthat a message could not be sent through it to any distance. The larger\r\nmass of metal, on the contrary, is capable of affording passage for the\r\nelectric fluid through any amount of rain, without danger of \"leakage;\"\r\nand as for the kites and other large birds of the country, they may perch\r\non these rods by thousands without stopping the messages, which will fly\r\nharmlessly through their claws; and the weight of the heaviest monkey is\r\nnot sufficient to injure them. These rods are planted, without any\r\ninsulation, upon the tops of bamboo poles (coated with tar and pitch), at\r\nsuch a height that loaded elephants can pass beneath without displacing\r\nthem; and even if by chance they should be thrown down, bullock-carts or\r\nbuffaloes and elephants may trample them under foot without doing them\r\ninjury. In some places the rods, if we are rightly informed, run through\r\nrice-swamps, buried in the ground, and even here the only insulating\r\nmaterial used is a kind of cement made of rosin and sand. The telegraph,\r\nlike a swift messenger, goes forward and prepares the way for the\r\nrailroad, which is planned to follow in its footsteps. When these two\r\nsystems are completed, the real consolidation of England's power in the\r\nEast will have commenced, and the countless resources of the Indian\r\npeninsula will be called forth for the benefit of the conquered as well as\r\nof the conquering race.\r\n\r\nThe restless spirit of English engineers, having provided for the internal\r\ntelegraphic communication of Great Britain and her principal dependencies,\r\nseems bent upon stretching out her lines to the East and to the West, so\r\nas ultimately to clasp the entire globe. The project of connecting,\r\ntelegraphically, England with America is at the present moment seriously\r\nengaging the attention of scientific and commercial men. The more daring\r\nengineers are still sanguine of the practicability of laying a submarine\r\ncable directly across the Atlantic, from Galway to Cape Race in\r\nNewfoundland. Now that we have Lieutenant Maury's authentic determination\r\nof the existence of a shelf across the North Atlantic, the soundings on\r\nwhich are nowhere more than 1,500 fathoms, the feasibility of the project\r\nis tolerably certain. The principal question is, whether if a line were\r\nlaid an electric current can be worked to commercial advantage through\r\n3,000 miles of cable. No doubt, by the expenditure of enormous battery\r\npower, this might be accomplished through wires suspended in the air, but\r\nit is a question whether it can be done along a vast length of\r\ngutta-percha coated wire, passing through salt-water. There is such a\r\nthing as _too great an insulation_. Professor Faraday has shown that in\r\nsuch circumstances the wire becomes a Leyden jar, and may be so charged\r\nwith electricity that a current cannot, without the greatest difficulty,\r\nmove through it. This is the objection to a direct cable between the two\r\ncontinents: if, however, it can be overcome, doubtless the ocean path\r\nwould in all possible cases be adopted where communications had to be\r\nmade between civilized countries having intermediate, barbarous, or\r\nungenial lands. To escape this at present dubious ocean path, it is\r\nproposed to carry the cable from the northernmost point of the Highlands\r\nof Scotland to Iceland, by way of the Orkney, Shetland, and Ferroe\r\nislands--to lay it from Iceland across to the nearest point in Greenland,\r\nthence down the coast to Cape Farewell, where the cable would again take\r\nto the water, span Davis's Straits, and make right away across Labrador\r\nand Upper Canada to Quebec. Here it would lock in with the North American\r\nmeshwork of wires, which hold themselves out like an open hand for the\r\nEuropean grasp. This plan seems quite feasible, for in no part of the\r\njourney would the cable require to be more than 900 miles long; and as it\r\nseems pretty certain that a sandbank ex-tends, with good soundings, all\r\nthe way to Cape Farewell, there would be little difficulty in mooring the\r\ncable to a level and soft bottom. The only obstacle that we see is the\r\nstrong partiality of the Esquimaux for old iron, and it would perhaps be\r\ntempting them too much to hang their coasts with this material, just ready\r\nto their hands. The want of settlements along this inhospitable arctic\r\ncoast to protect the wire is, we confess, a great drawback to the scheme;\r\nbut, we fancy, posts might be organized at comparatively a small cost,\r\nconsidering the magnitude and importance of the undertaking. The mere\r\nexpense of making and laying the cable would not be much more than double\r\nthat of building the new Westminster-bridge across the Thames.\r\n\r\nWhilst England would thus grasp the West with one hand, her active\r\nchildren have plotted the seizure of the East with the other. A cable runs\r\nfrom Genoa to Corsica, and from thence to Sardinia. From the southernmost\r\npoint of the latter island, Cape Spartivento, to the gulf of Tunis,\r\nanother cable can easily be carried. The direction thence (after giving\r\noff a coast branch to Algeria) will be along the African shore, by Tripoli\r\nto Alexandria, and eventually across Arabia, along the coasts of Persia\r\nand Beloochistan until it enters Scinde, and finally joins the wire at\r\nHydrabad, which in all probability by that time will have advanced from\r\nBurmah, across the Indian peninsula, to welcome it. America will shortly\r\ncarry her line of telegraph to the Pacific shore, and run it up the coast\r\nas far as San Francisco. Can there be any reasonable doubt that, before\r\nthe end of the century, the one line advancing towards the West and the\r\nother towards the East--through China and Siberia--will gradually approach\r\neach other so closely that a short cable stretched across Behring Straits\r\nwill bring the four quarters of the globe within speaking distance of each\r\nother, and enable the electric fire to \"put a girdle round the world in\r\nforty minutes?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRES AND FIRE INSURANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the more salient features of the metropolis which instantly strike\r\nthe attention of the stranger are the stations of the Fire Brigade.\r\nWhenever he happens to pass them, he finds the sentinel on duty, he sees\r\nthe \"red artillery\" of the force; and the polished axle, the gleaming\r\nbranch, and the shining chain, testify to the beautiful condition of the\r\ninstrument, ready for active service at a moment's notice. Ensconced in\r\nthe shadow of the station, the liveried watchmen look like hunters waiting\r\nfor their prey--nor does the hunter move quicker to his quarry at the\r\nrustle of a leaf, than the Firemen dash for the first ruddy glow in the\r\nsky. No sooner comes the alarm, than one sees with a shudder the rush of\r\none of these engines through the crowded streets, the tearing horses\r\ncovered with foam, the heavy vehicle swerving from side to side, and the\r\nblack helmeted attendants swaying to and fro. The wonder is that horses or\r\nmen ever get safely to their destination: the wonder is still greater that\r\nno one is ridden over in their furious drive.\r\n\r\nArrived at the place of action, the hunter's spirit which animates the\r\nfireman, and makes him attack an element as determinedly as he would a\r\nwild beast, becomes evident to the spectator. The scene which a London\r\nfire presents can never be forgotten: the shouts of the crowd as it opens\r\nto let the engines dart through it, the foaming head of water springing\r\nout of the ground, and spreading over the road until it becomes a broad\r\nmirror reflecting the glowing blaze--the black, snake-like coils of the\r\nleather hose rising and falling like things of life, whilst a hundred\r\narms work at the pump, their central heart, the applause that rings out\r\nclear above the roaring flame as the adventurous band throw the first\r\nhissing jet; cheer following cheer, as stream after stream shoots against\r\nthe burning mass, now flying into the socket-holes of fire, set in the\r\nblack face of the house-front, now dashing with a loud shir-r against the\r\nwindow-frame and wall, and falling off in broken showers. Suddenly there\r\nis a loud shrill cry, and the bank of human faces is upturned to where a\r\nshrieking wretch hangs frantically to an upper window-sill. A deafening\r\nshout goes forth, as the huge fire-escape comes full swing upon the scene:\r\na moment's pause, and all is still, save the beat, beat, of the great\r\nwater pulses, whilst every eye is strained towards the fluttering garments\r\nflapping against the wall. Will the ladder reach, and not dislodge those\r\nweary hands clutching so convulsively to the hot stone! Will the nimble\r\nfigure gain the topmost rung ere nature fails? The blood in a thousand\r\nhearts runs cold, and then again break forth a thousand cheers to\r\ncelebrate a daring rescue. Such scenes as this are of almost nightly\r\noccurrence in the great metropolis. A still more imposing yet dreadful\r\nsight is often exhibited in the conflagrations of those vast piles of\r\nbuildings in the City filled with inflammable merchandise. Here the most\r\npowerful engines seem reduced to mere squirts; and the efforts of the\r\nadventurous brigade men are confined to keeping the mischief within its\r\nown bounds.\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect that London presents an area of thirty-six square miles,\r\ncovered with 21,600 square acres of bricks and mortar, and numbers more\r\nthan 380,600 houses; that all the riches it contains are nightly\r\nthreatened in every direction by an ever-present enemy; that the secret\r\nmatch, the spontaneous fire, and the hand of the drunkard, are busily at\r\nwork; it is evident that nothing but a force the most disciplined, and\r\nimplements the most effective, can be competent to cope with so sudden and\r\npersevering a foe.\r\n\r\nAs late as twenty-two years ago there was no proper fire police to protect\r\nthe metropolis against what is commonly called the \"all-devouring\r\nelement.\" There was, it is true, a force of 300 parochial engines set on\r\nfoot by acts which were passed between the years 1768-74, acts which are\r\nstill in existence; but these engines are under the superintendence of the\r\nbeadles and parish engineers, who are not the most active of men or nimble\r\nof risers. It may easily be imagined, therefore, that the machines arrived\r\na little too late; and, when brought into service, were often found to be\r\nout of working order. Hence their employment did not supersede the private\r\nengines kept by some of the insurance offices long prior to their\r\nexistence. On the contrary, owing to the increase of business which took\r\nplace about this time, the different companies thought it worth their\r\nwhile to strengthen their former establishments, and this process\r\ncontinued while the parochial engines, with a few honourable exceptions,\r\nwere dropping into disuse.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1833 it became evident that much was lost, both to the\r\npublic and to the insurance companies, by every engine acting on its own\r\nresponsibility--a folly which is the cause of such jealousy among the\r\nfiremen at Boston (United States), that rival engines have been known to\r\nstop on their way to a fire to exchange shots from revolvers. It was,\r\ntherefore, determined to incorporate the divided force, and place it under\r\nthe management of one superintendent, each office contributing towards its\r\nsupport, according to the amount of its business. All the old-established\r\ncompanies, with one exception,[41] shortly came into the arrangement, and\r\nMr. Braidwood, the master of the fire-engines of Edinburgh, being invited\r\nto take the command, organized the now celebrated _London Fire Brigade_.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, then, the protection against fire in London\r\nconsists, firstly, in the three hundred and odd parish-engines (two to\r\neach parish), which are paid for out of the rates. The majority of these\r\nare very inefficient, not having any persons appointed to work them who\r\npossess a competent knowledge of the service. Even women used now and then\r\nto fill the arduous post of director; and it is not long since a certain\r\nMrs. Smith, a widow, might be seen at conflagrations, hurrying about in\r\nher pattens, directing the firemen of her engine, which belonged to the\r\nunited parishes of St. Michael Royal and St. Martin Vintry, in the city.\r\nWe question, indeed, if at the present moment any of the parish-engines\r\nare much better officered than in the days of widow Smith, with the\r\nexception of those of Hackney, Whitechapel, Islington, and perhaps two or\r\nthree others. Secondly, there are an unknown number of private engines\r\nkept in public buildings and large manufactories, which sometimes do good\r\nservice when they arrive early at small fires in their neighbourhood,\r\nalthough, singularly enough, when called upon to extinguish a\r\nconflagration in their own establishments, they generally \"lose their\r\nheads,\" as the brigade men express it; and very many instances have\r\noccurred where even the parish-engines have arrived and set to work before\r\nthe one on the premises could be brought to bear upon the fire. The cause\r\nis clear. The requisite coolness and method which every one can exercise\r\nso philosophically in other people's misfortunes utterly fail them when in\r\ntrouble themselves. The doctor is wiser in his generation, and is never so\r\nfoolish as to prescribe for himself or to attend his own family.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we have, in contrast to the immense rabble of Bumble engines and\r\nthe Bashi-Bazouks of private establishments, the small complement of men\r\nand material of the fire brigade. It consists of twenty-seven large\r\nhorse-engines, capable of throwing eighty-eight gallons a minute to the\r\nheight of from fifty to seventy feet, and nine smaller ones drawn by hand.\r\nTo work them there are twelve engineers, seven sub-engineers, thirty-two\r\nsenior firemen, thirty-nine junior firemen, and fourteen drivers, or 104\r\nmen and 31 horses. In addition to these persons, who form the main\r\nestablishment, and live at the different stations, there is an extra staff\r\nof four firemen, four drivers, and eight horses. The members of this\r\nsupplementary force are also lodged at the stations,[42] as well as\r\nclothed, but are only paid when their services are required, and pursue in\r\nthe daytime their ordinary occupations. This not very formidable army of\r\n104 men and 31 horses, with its reserve of eight men and eight horses, is\r\ndistributed throughout the metropolis, which is divided into four\r\ndistricts as follows:--On the north side of the river--1st, From the\r\neastward to Paul's Chain, St. Paul's Churchyard, Aldersgate Street, and\r\nGoswell Street Road; 2nd, From St. Paul's, &c., to Tottenham Court Road,\r\nCrown Street, and St. Martin's Lane; 3rd, From Tottenham Court Road, &c.,\r\nwestward; 4th, The entire south side of the river. At the head of each\r\ndistrict is a foreman, who never leaves it unless acting under the\r\nsuperior orders of Mr. Braidwood, the superintendent or general-in-chief,\r\nwhose head-quarters are in Watling Street.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the great continental cities, such a force seems truly\r\ninsignificant. Paris, which does not cover a fifth part of the ground of\r\nLondon, and is not much more than a third as populous, boasts 800\r\n_sapeurs-pompiers_: we make up, however, for want of numbers by activity.\r\nAgain, our look-out is admirable: the 6,000 police of the metropolis,\r\npatrolling every alley and lane throughout its length and breadth, watch\r\nfor a fire as terriers watch at rat-holes, and every man is stimulated by\r\nthe knowledge, that if he is the first to give notice of it at any of the\r\nstations it is half a sovereign in his pocket. In addition to the police,\r\nthere are the thousand eager eyes of the night cabmen, and the houseless\r\npoor. It is not at all uncommon for a cabman to earn four or five\r\nshillings of a night by driving fast to the different stations and giving\r\nthe alarm, receiving a shilling from each for the \"call.\"\r\n\r\nIn most continental cities a watchman takes his stand during the night on\r\nthe topmost point of some high building, and gives notice by either\r\nblowing a horn, firing a gun, or ringing a bell. In Germany the quarter is\r\nindicated by holding out towards it a flag by day, and a lantern at night.\r\nIt immediately suggests itself that a sentinel placed in the upper gallery\r\nof St. Paul's would have under his eye the whole metropolis, and could\r\nmake known instantly, by means of an electric wire, the position of a\r\nfire, to the head-station at Watling Street, in the same manner as the\r\nAmericans do in Boston. This plan is, however, open to the objection, that\r\nLondon is intersected by a sinuous river, which renders it difficult to\r\ntell on which bank the conflagration is raging. Nevertheless, we imagine\r\nthat the northern part of the town could be advantageously superintended\r\nfrom such a height, whilst the southern half might rest under the\r\nsurveillance of one of the tall shot-towers on that bank of the Thames.\r\nThe bridges themselves have long been posts of observation, from which a\r\nlarge portion of the river-side property is watched. Not long ago there\r\nwas a pieman on London Bridge, who eked out a precarious existence by\r\nkeeping a good look-out up and down the stream.\r\n\r\nWatling Street was chosen as the head-quarters of the Fire Brigade for a\r\ndouble reason: it is very nearly the centre of the City, being close to\r\nthe far-famed London Stone, and it is in the very midst of what may be\r\ntermed, speaking igneously, the most dangerous part of the metropolis--the\r\nManchester warehouses. As the Fire Brigade is only a portion of a vast\r\ncommercial operation--Fire Insurance--its actions are regulated by\r\nstrictly commercial considerations. Where the largest amount of _insured_\r\nproperty lies, there its chief force is planted. It will, it is true, go\r\nany reasonable distance to put out a fire; but of course it pays most\r\nattention to property which its proprietors have guaranteed. The central\r\nstation receives the greatest number of \"calls;\" but as a\r\ncommander-in-chief does not turn out for a skirmish of outposts, so Mr.\r\nBraidwood keeps himself ready for affairs of a more serious nature. When\r\nthe summons is at night--there are sometimes as many as half a dozen--the\r\nfireman on duty below apprises the superintendent by means of a gutta\r\npercha speaking-tube, which comes up to his bedside. By the light of the\r\never-burning gas, he rapidly consults the \"London Directory,\" and if the\r\ncall should be to what is called \"a greengrocer's street,\" or any of the\r\nsmall thoroughfares in by-parts of the town, he leaves the matter to the\r\nforeman in whose district it is, and goes to sleep again. If, however, the\r\nfire should be in the City, or in any of the great west-end thoroughfares,\r\nhe hurries off on the first engine. Five minutes is considered a fair time\r\nfor an engine \"to horse and away,\" but it is often done in three. Celerity\r\nin bringing up aid is the great essential, as the first half hour\r\ngenerally determines the extent to which a conflagration will proceed.\r\nHence the rewards of thirty shillings for the first, twenty for the\r\nsecond, and ten for the third engine that arrives, which premiums are paid\r\nby the parish. All the engines travel with as few hands as possible: the\r\nlarger ones having an engineer, four firemen and a driver, and the\r\nfollowing furniture:--\r\n\r\n    \"Several lengths of scaling-ladder, each 6-1/2 feet long, all of which\r\n    may be readily connected, forming in a short space of time a ladder of\r\n    any required length; a canvas sheet, with ten or twelve handles of\r\n    rope round the edge of it for the purpose of a fire-escape; one\r\n    10-fathom and one 14-fathom piece of 2-1/2-inch rope; six lengths of\r\n    hose, each 40 feet long; two branch-pipes, one 2-1/2 feet, and the\r\n    other from 4 to 6 feet long, with one spare nose-pipe; two 6-feet\r\n    lengths of suction-pipe, a flat rose, stand-cock, goose-neck,\r\n    dam-board, boat-hook, saw, shovel, mattock, pole-axe, screw-wrench,\r\n    crow-bar, portable cistern, two dog-tails, two balls of strips of\r\n    sheepskin, two balls of small cord, instruments for opening the\r\n    fire-plugs, and keys for turning the stop-cocks of the water-mains.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight of the whole, with the men, is not less than from 27 to 30\r\ncwt., a load which in the excitement of the ride is carried by a couple of\r\nhorses at the gallop.\r\n\r\nThe hands to work the pumps are always forthcoming on the spot at any hour\r\nof the night, not alone for goodwill, as every man--and there have been as\r\nmany as five hundred employed at a time--receives one shilling for the\r\nfirst hour and sixpence for every succeeding one, together with\r\nrefreshments. In France the law empowers the firemen to seize upon the\r\nbystanders, and compel them to give their services, without fee or reward.\r\nAn Englishman at Bordeaux, whilst looking on, some few years since, was\r\nforced, in spite of his remonstrances, to roll wine-casks for seven hours\r\nout of the vicinity of a conflagration. We need not say which plan answers\r\nbest. A Frenchman runs away, as soon as the _sapeurs-pompiers_ make their\r\nappearance upon the scene, to avoid being impressed. Still such is the\r\nexcitement, that there are some gentlemen with us who pursue the\r\noccupation of firemen as amateurs; providing themselves with the\r\nregulation-dress of dark-green turned up with red, and with the\r\naccoutrements of the Brigade, and working, under the orders of Mr.\r\nBraidwood, as energetically as if they were earning their daily bread.\r\n\r\nThe fascination of fires even extends to the brute creation. Who has not\r\nheard of the dog \"Chance,\" who first formed his acquaintance with the\r\nBrigade by following a fireman from a conflagration in Shoreditch to the\r\ncentral station at Watling Street? Here, after he had been petted for some\r\nlittle time by the men, his master came for him, and took him home; but he\r\nescaped on the first opportunity, and returned to the station. After he\r\nhad been carried back for the third time, his master--like a mother whose\r\nson _will_ go to sea--allowed him to have his own way, and for years he\r\ninvariably accompanied the engine, now upon the machine, now under the\r\nhorses' legs, and always, when going up-hill, running in advance, and\r\nannouncing the welcome advent of the extinguisher by his bark. At the fire\r\nhe used to amuse himself with pulling burning logs of wood out of the\r\nflames with his mouth. Although he had his legs broken half a dozen times,\r\nhe remained faithful to his pursuit; till at last, having received a\r\nseverer hurt than usual, he was being nursed by the fireman beside the\r\nhearth, when a \"call\" came, and at the well-known sound of the engine\r\nturning out, the poor brute made a last effort to climb upon it, and fell\r\nback dead in the attempt. He was stuffed and preserved at the station, and\r\nwas doomed, even in death, to prove the fireman's friend: for one of the\r\nengineers having committed suicide, the Brigade determined to raffle him\r\nfor the benefit of the widow, _and such was his renown, that he realized_\r\n123_l._ 10_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and practical part of our subject is the inquiry into\r\nthe various causes of fires. Mr. Braidwood comes here to our aid with his\r\ninvaluable yearly reports--the only materials we have, in fact, on which\r\nfire insurance can be built up into a science, a feat which we have not\r\naccomplished to nearly the same extent as with life assurance, although\r\nthe Hand-in-Hand office was founded so far back as 1696. Thus we have the\r\nexperience of upwards of 150 years, if we could only get at it, to enable\r\nthe actuary to ascertain the doctrine of chances in this momentous\r\nsubject, which at present is little better than a speculation. An analysis\r\nof the reports, from the organization of the Fire Brigade in 1833 to the\r\nclose of 1853, a period extending over 21 years, affords the following\r\nresult:\r\n\r\nAbstract of List of Fires and Alarms for Twenty Years, ending 1853.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Year.| Totally |Considerably|Slightly|Total |      Alarms.      |Total of\r\n       |Destroyed|  Damaged.  |Damaged.| of   |-------------------|Fires &\r\n       |         |            |        |Fires.|False|Chimn'y|Total|Alarms.\r\n  -----|---------|------------|--------|------|-----|-------|-----|--------\r\n  1833 |   31    |    135     |   292  |   458|  59 |   75  |  134|   592\r\n  1834 |   28    |    116     |   338  |   482|  57 |  112  |  169|   651\r\n  1835 |   31    |    125     |   315  |   471|  66 |  106  |  172|   643\r\n  1836 |   33    |    134     |   397  |   564|  66 |  126  |  192|   756\r\n  1837 |   22    |    122     |   357  |   501|  82 |  134  |  216|   717\r\n  1838 |   33    |    152     |   383  |   568|  79 |  108  |  187|   755\r\n  1839 |   17    |    165     |   402  |   584|  70 |  101  |  171|   755\r\n  1840 |   26    |    204     |   451  |   681|  84 |   98  |  182|   863\r\n  1841 |   24    |    234     |   438  |   696|  67 |   92  |  159|   855\r\n  1842 |   24    |    224     |   521  |   769|  61 |   82  |  143|   912\r\n  1843 |   29    |    231     |   489  |   749|  79 |   83  |  162|   911\r\n  1844 |   23    |    237     |   502  |   762|  70 |   94  |  164|   926\r\n  1845 |   23    |    253     |   431  |   707|  82 |   87  |  168|   875\r\n  1846 |   25    |    233     |   576  |   834| 119 |   69  |  188| 1,022\r\n  1847 |   27    |    273     |   536  |   836|  88 |   66  |  154|   990\r\n  1848 |   27    |    269     |   509  |   805| 120 |   86  |  206| 1,011\r\n  1849 |   28    |    228     |   582  |   838|  76 |   89  |  165| 1,003\r\n  1850 |   18    |    229     |   621  |   868|  91 |   79  |  170| 1,038\r\n  1851 |   21    |    255     |   652  |   928| 115 |  116  |  231| 1,159\r\n  1852 |   25    |    238     |   660  |   923|  93 |   89  |  182| 1,105\r\n  1853 |   20    |    241     |   629  |   900|  72 |   90  |  162| 1,062\r\n  -----|---------|------------|--------|------|-----|-------|-----|--------\r\n  Total|  535    |  4,298     |10,091  |14,924|1,695|1,982  |3,677|18,601\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf we examine this table, we find ample evidence that the organization of\r\nthe Fire Brigade has resulted in an abatement of loss and labour. Taking\r\nthe average of the last twenty-one years, there has been a decrease of 5·7\r\nin the last year under the head of \"totally destroyed.\" This is the best\r\ntest of the activity of the Brigade, and really means much more than is\r\nobvious at first sight. Within these twenty-one years many tens of\r\nthousands of houses have been added to the metropolis; our periphery has\r\nbeen continually enlarging; like a tree, we grow year by year by adding a\r\nfresh ring of bricks and mortar. Whilst this increase is going on\r\nexternally, the central part is growing too. We can afford no dead wood in\r\nour very heart: if it cannot expand one way it must another. Accordingly,\r\nwe find the crowded city extending towards the sky; and if we take into\r\naccount the immense mass of material added to that which existed, all of\r\nwhich is equally liable to the inroads of fire, we can understand why the\r\ntotal number of conflagrations has increased from 458 in 1833 to 900 in\r\n1853. With such an augmentation of conflagrations, the _decrease_ of\r\nhouses totally destroyed in 1853 is the highest testimony to the ability\r\nand zeal of Mr. Braidwood.\r\n\r\nThe item \"totally destroyed\" is mainly made up of houses and factories in\r\nwhich are stored very combustible materials, such as carpenters' and\r\ncabinet-makers' shops, oilmen's warehouses, sawmills, &c., where the fire\r\ngains such a hold in a few minutes as to preclude the possibility of\r\nputting it out. The number is also swelled by houses which are situated\r\nmany miles from the nearest station; for there are no stations in the\r\noutskirts of the town, and very few in the crowded suburbs. We have seen\r\ncomplaints of this want of help in thickly-populated localities; but the\r\ncompanies only plant an establishment where the insurances are sufficient\r\nto cover the expense, and people who do not contribute have no more right\r\nto expect private individuals to take care of their property than\r\ntradesmen in the Strand would have to expect the private watchman outside\r\nMessrs. Coutts' bank to look after their shutters. Indeed, it seems to us\r\nthat the Brigade act very liberally. The firemen never stop to ask\r\nwhether the house is insured or not; nor are they deterred by distance;\r\nand in many cases they have gone as far as Brentford, Putney, Croydon,\r\nBarnet, Uxbridge, Cranfordbridge, Windsor Castle, and once to Dover by an\r\nexpress engine. The only difference made by the Brigade between insured\r\nand uninsured property is, that after putting out a fire they take charge\r\nof the salvage of the former, and leave that of the latter to its owner.\r\nThe force is, however, very careful to repair immediately any damage they\r\nmay have done to adjoining property--damage which they commit in the most\r\ndeliberate manner, regardless of pains and penalties. For instance,\r\n_housebreaking_ is almost a nightly crime with the firemen whilst in\r\nsearch of water, who never let a wall or a door stand between them and a\r\nsupply of this element. It is a proof of the good feeling which prevails\r\non such occasions that, although they are technically guilty of an offence\r\nwhich renders them liable to punishment, no one murmurs, much less\r\nthreatens proceedings. If the authorities in the great fire of London had\r\nacted in a similar manner for the public good, they would have saved the\r\nhalf of the Inner Temple, which was destroyed because, according to\r\nClarendon's account, all the lawyers were absent on circuit, and the\r\nconstables did not dare to take the responsibility of breaking open their\r\nchamber doors!\r\n\r\nIt is a question whether government ought not to relieve the parish\r\nauthorities from a duty which they cannot separately perform, and combine\r\ntheir engines into a metropolitan brigade; thus guarding the town from\r\nfire as they do from robbery by the police. If people will not protect\r\nthemselves by insuring, the state should protect them, and make them pay\r\nfor it. An excellent system prevails in most parts of Germany of levying a\r\nrate at the close of the year upon all the inhabitants, sufficient to\r\ncover the loss from fires during the past twelvemonth. As every\r\nhouseholder has a pecuniary interest in the result, he keeps a bucket and\r\nbelt, and sallies out to extinguish the conflagration in his neighbour's\r\npremises. If the rate were adopted in London, and the present enormous\r\nduty on insurances reduced, the cost to each person would be hardly more\r\npence than it is pounds at present to the provident few.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Brown, of the Institute of Actuaries, after analyzing the\r\nreturns of Mr. Braidwood, as well as the reports in the _Mechanics'\r\nMagazine_ by Mr. Baddeley, who has devoted much attention to the subject,\r\ndrew up some tables of the times of the year and hours of the day at which\r\nfires are most frequent. It would naturally be supposed that the winter\r\nwould show a vast preponderance over the summer months; but the difference\r\nis not so great as might be expected. December and January are very\r\nprolific of fires, as in these months large public buildings are heated by\r\nflues, stoves, and boilers; but the other months share mishaps of the kind\r\npretty equally, with the exception that the hot and dry periods of summer\r\nand autumn are marked by the most destructive class of conflagrations,\r\nowing to the greater inflammability of the materials, than in the damper\r\nportions of the year. This, from the desiccating nature of the climate, is\r\nespecially the case in Canada and the United States, and, coupled with the\r\nextensive use of wood in building, has a large influence in many parts of\r\nthe continent. The following list of all the great fires which have taken\r\nplace for the last hundred years will bear out our statement:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Month.| Description of Property, |    Place.    |Value of Property| Year.\r\n        |          &c.             |              |    Destroyed.   |\r\n  ---------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|------\r\n          {Webb's Sugar-house      |Liverpool     |          £4,600 | 1829\r\n          {Lancelot's-hey          |   \"          |         198,000 | 1833\r\n          {Town-hall and Exchange  |   \"          |          45,000 | 1795\r\n   Jan.   {Caxton Printing Office  |   \"          |                 | 1821\r\n          {Dublin & Co.

1854._)\r\n\r\nOne reason, perhaps, why there is such a general average in the number of\r\nconflagrations throughout the year is, that the vast majority occur in\r\nfactories and workshops where fire is used in summer as well as winter.\r\nThis supposition appears at first sight to be contradicted by the fact\r\nthat nearly as many fires occur on Sunday as on any other day of the week.\r\nBut when it is remembered that in numerous establishments it is necessary\r\nto keep in the fires throughout that day, and as in the majority of cases\r\na very inadequate watch is kept, it is at once apparent why there is no\r\nimmunity from the scourge. Indeed, some of the most destructive fires have\r\nbroken out on a Sunday night or on a Sunday morning; no doubt because a\r\nlarge body of fire had formed before it was detected. A certain number of\r\naccidents occur in summer in private houses from persons on hot nights\r\nopening the window behind the toilet-glass in their bedrooms, when the\r\ndraught blows the blind against the candle. Swallows do not more certainly\r\nappear in June, than such mishaps are found reported at the sultry season.\r\n\r\nIf we watch still more narrowly the habits of fires, we find that they are\r\nactive or dormant according to the time of day. Thus, during a period of\r\nnine years, the per-centage regularly increased from 1·96 at 9 o'clock\r\nA.M., the hour at which all households might be considered to be about,\r\nto 3·34 at 1 P.M., 3·55 at 5 P.M., and 8·15 per cent. at 10 P.M., which is\r\njust the time at which a fire left to itself by the departure of the\r\nworkmen would have had swing enough to become visible.\r\n\r\nThe origin of fires is now so narrowly inquired into by the officers of\r\nthe Brigade, and by means of inquests, that we have been made acquainted\r\nwith a vast number of curious causes which would never have been\r\nsuspected. From an analysis of fires which have occurred since the\r\nestablishment of the Brigade we have constructed the following tables:--\r\n\r\n  Curtains                              2,511\r\n  Candle                                1,178\r\n  Flues                                 1,555\r\n  Stoves                                  494\r\n  Gas                                     932\r\n  Light dropped down Area                  13\r\n  Lighted Tobacco falling down ditt         7\r\n  Dust falling on horizontal Flue           1\r\n  Doubtful                                 76\r\n  Incendiarism                             89\r\n  Carelessness                            100\r\n  Intoxication                             80\r\n  Dog                                       6\r\n  Cat                                      19\r\n  Hunting Bugs                             15\r\n  Clothes-horse upset by Monkey             1\r\n  Lucifers                                 80\r\n  Children playing with ditto              45\r\n  Rat gnawing ditto                         1\r\n  Jackdaw playing with ditto                1\r\n  Rat gnawing Gaspipe                       1\r\n  Boys letting off Fireworks               14\r\n  Fireworks going off                      63\r\n  Children playing with Fire               45\r\n  Spark from ditto                        243\r\n  Spark from Railway                        4\r\n  Smoking Tobacco                         166\r\n  Smoking Ants                              1\r\n  Smoking in Bed                            2\r\n  Reading in ditto                         22\r\n  Sewing in ditto                           4\r\n  Sewing by Candle                          1\r\n  Lime overheating                         44\r\n  Waste ditto                              43\r\n  Cargo of Lime ditto                       2\r\n  Rain slacking ditto                       5\r\n  High Tide                                 1\r\n  Explosion                                16\r\n  Spontaneous Combustion                   43\r\n  Heat from Sun                             8\r\n  Lightning                                 8\r\n  Carboy of Acid bursting                   2\r\n  Drying Linen                              1\r\n  Shirts falling into Fire                  6\r\n  Lighting and Upsetting Naphtha Lamp      58\r\n  Fire from Iron Kettle                     1\r\n  Sealing Letter                            1\r\n  Charcoal fire of a Suicide                1\r\n  Insanity                                  5\r\n  Bleaching Nuts                            7\r\n  Unknown                               1,323\r\n\r\nAmong the more common causes of fire (such as gas, candle, curtains taking\r\nfire, children playing with stoves, &c.) it is remarkable how uniformly\r\nthe same numbers occur under each head from year to year. General laws\r\nobtain as much in small as in great events. We are informed by the Post\r\nOffice authorities that about eight persons daily drop their letters into\r\nthe post without directing them; we know that there is an unvarying\r\npercentage of broken heads and limbs received into the hospitals; and here\r\nwe see that a regular number of houses take fire, year by year, from the\r\nleaping out of a spark or the dropping of a smouldering pipe of tobacco.\r\nIt may indeed be a long time before another conflagration will arise from\r\n\"a monkey upsetting a clothes-horse,\" but we have no doubt such an\r\naccident will recur in its appointed cycle.\r\n\r\nAlthough gas figures so largely as a cause of fire, it does not appear\r\nthat its rapid introduction of late years into private houses has been\r\nattended with danger. There is another kind of light, however, which the\r\ninsurance offices look upon with terror, especially those who make it\r\ntheir business to insure farm property. The assistant-secretary of one of\r\nthe largest fire-offices, speaking broadly, informed us that the\r\nintroduction of the lucifer-match _caused them an annual loss of ten\r\nthousand pounds_! In the foregoing list we see in how many ways they have\r\ngiven rise to fires.\r\n\r\n  Lucifers going off probably from heat      80\r\n  Children playing with lucifers             45\r\n  Rat gnawing lucifers                        1\r\n  Jackdaw playing with lucifers               1\r\n                                           ----\r\n                                            127\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-seven known fires thus arise from this single\r\ncause; and no doubt many of the twenty-five fires ascribed to the agency\r\nof cats and dogs were owing to their having thrown down boxes of matches\r\nat night, which they frequently do, and which is almost certain to produce\r\ncombustion. The item \"rat gnawing lucifer,\" reminds us to give a warning\r\nagainst leaving about wax lucifers where there are either rats or mice,\r\nfor these vermin constantly run away with them to their holes behind the\r\ninflammable canvas, and eat the wax until they reach the phosphorus, which\r\nis ignited by the friction of their teeth. Many fires are believed to have\r\nbeen produced by this singular circumstance. How much, again, must\r\nlucifers have contributed to swell the large class of conflagrations whose\r\ncauses are unknown! Another cause of fire, which is of recent date, is the\r\nuse of naphtha in lamps,--a most ignitible fluid when mixed in certain\r\nproportions with common air. \"A delightful novel\" figures as a proximate,\r\nif not an immediate, cause of twenty-two fires. This might be expected;\r\nbut what can be the meaning of a fire caused by a high tide? When we asked\r\nMr. Braidwood the question, he answered, \"Oh, we always look out for fires\r\nwhen there is a high tide. They arise from the heating of lime upon the\r\naddition of water.\" Thus rain, we see, has caused four conflagrations, and\r\nsimple over-heating forty-four. The lime does no harm so long as it is\r\nmerely in contact with wood; but if iron happens to be in juxtaposition\r\nwith the two, it speedily becomes red-hot, and barges on the river have\r\nbeen sunk, by reason of their bolts and iron knees burning holes in their\r\nbottoms. Of the singular entry, \"rat gnawing a gaspipe,\" the firemen state\r\nthat it is common for rats to gnaw leaden service-pipes, for the purpose,\r\nit is supposed, of getting at the water, and in this instance the grey\r\nrodent laboured under a mistake, and let out the raw material of the\r\nopposite element. Intoxication is a fruitful cause of fires, especially in\r\npublic-houses and inns.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly imagined that the introduction of hot water, hot air, and\r\nsteam-pipes, as a means of heating buildings, cuts off one avenue of\r\ndanger from fire. This is an error. Iron pipes, often heated up to 400°,\r\nare placed in close contact with floors and skirting-boards, supported by\r\nslight diagonal props of wood, which a much lower degree of heat will\r\nsuffice to ignite. The circular rim supporting a still at the\r\nApothecaries' Hall, which was used in the preparation of some medicament\r\nthat required a temperature of only 300°, was found, not long ago, to have\r\ncharred a circle, at least a quarter of an inch deep, in the wood beneath\r\nit, in less than six months. Mr. Braidwood, in his evidence before a\r\nCommittee of the House of Lords, in 1846, stated that it was his belief\r\nthat by long exposure to heat, not much exceeding that of boiling water,\r\nor 212°, timber is brought into such a condition that it will fire without\r\nthe application of a light. The time during which this process of\r\ndesiccation goes on, until it ends in spontaneous combustion, is, he\r\nthinks, from eight to ten years; _so that a fire might be hatching in a\r\nman's premises during the whole of his lease, without making any sign_!\r\n\r\nMr. Hosking, in his very useful and sensible little \"Guide to the proper\r\nRegulation of Buildings in Towns,\" quotes the following case, which\r\ncompletely confirms Mr. Braidwood's opinion, and explodes the idea that\r\nheat applied through the medium of pipes must be safe.\r\n\r\n    \"Day and Martin's well-known blacking manufactory in High Holborn was\r\n    heated by means of hot water passing through iron tubes into the\r\n    various parts of the building. In December, 1848, the wooden casing\r\n    and other woodwork about the upright main pipes were found to be on\r\n    fire, and from no other cause that could be discovered than the\r\n    constant exposure for a long time of the wood to heat from the pipes.\r\n    In this case the pipes were not in contact with the wooden casing, but\r\n    they were stayed and kept upright by cross fillets of wood, which\r\n    touched them, and these it was which appeared to have taken fire. The\r\n    small circulating pipes which conveyed the hot water throughout the\r\n    several chambers were raised from the floor to about the extent of\r\n    their own diameter, and the floors showed no signs of fire where the\r\n    pipes were so removed; but in _every case_ where the prop or saddle\r\n    which held the pipe up from the floor had been displaced, and the pipe\r\n    had been allowed to sag and touch the floor, _the boards were\r\n    charred_. It was understood that the temperature of the water in the\r\n    pipes never much exceeded 300°. The practical teaching of this case\r\n    clearly is, that pipes should on no consideration be placed nearer to\r\n    wood than the distance of their own diameters. Wood dried in the\r\n    thorough manner we have mentioned is so liable to catch fire at the\r\n    momentary propinquity of flame, that practical men imagine there must\r\n    be an atmosphere of some kind surrounding it of a highly inflammable\r\n    nature. In cases of pine wood we could well understand such a theory,\r\n    as we know that a stick thrust into the fire will emit from its free\r\n    end a volatile spirit of turpentine, which lights like a jet of gas.\r\n\r\n    \"Mercers' Hall, burnt in 1853, was the victim of its hot-water pipes,\r\n    which had not been in work more than four or five years. The vaulted\r\n    room in the British Museum, which contains some of the Nineveh\r\n    marbles, was fired--or rather the carpenters' work about--in a similar\r\n    manner; and if report tells the truth, the new Houses of Parliament\r\n    have been on fire several times already from a similar cause.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the heads \"Incendiarism,\" \"Doubtful,\" and \"Unknown,\" are included\r\nall the cases of wilful firing. The return, \"Incendiarism,\" is never made\r\nunless there has been a conviction, which rarely takes place, as the\r\noffices are only anxious to protect themselves against fraud, and do not\r\nlike the trouble or bad odour of being prosecutors on public grounds. If\r\nthe evidence of wilful firing, however, is conclusive, the insured, when\r\nhe applies for his money, is significantly informed by the secretary that\r\nunless he leaves the office, _he will hang him_. Though arson is no\r\nlonger punished by death, the hint is usually taken. Now and then, such\r\nflagrant offenders are met with, that the office cannot avoid pursuing\r\nthem with the utmost rigour of the law. Such, in 1851, was the case of a\r\n\"respectable\" solicitor, living in Lime-street, Watling-street, who had\r\ninsured his house and furniture for a sum much larger than they were\r\nworth. The means he adopted for the commission of his crime without\r\ndiscovery were apparently sure; but it was the very pains he took to\r\naccomplish his end which led to his detection. He had specially made to\r\norder a deep tray of iron, in the centre of which was placed a socket. The\r\ntray he filled with naphtha, and in the socket he put a candle, the light\r\nof which was shaded by a funnel. The candle was one of the kind which he\r\nused for his gig-lamp,--for he kept a gig,--and was calculated to last a\r\nstated time before it reached the naphtha. He furtively deposited the\r\nwhole machine in the cellar, within eight inches of the wooden floor, in a\r\nplace constructed to conceal it. The attorney went out, and on coming back\r\nagain found, as he expected, that his house was on fire. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, for him--if it is ever a misfortune to a scoundrel to be\r\ndetected,--it was put out at a very early stage, and the firemen, whilst\r\nin the act of extinguishing it, discovered this infernal machine. The\r\norder to make it was traced to the delinquent: a female servant, irritated\r\nat the idea of his having left her in the house to be burnt to death, gave\r\nevidence against him. He was tried and convicted, and is now expiating his\r\ncrime at Norfolk Island. Plans for rebuilding this villain's house, and\r\nestimates of the expense, were found afterwards among his papers.\r\n\r\nThe class \"doubtful\" includes all those cases in which the offices have no\r\nmoral doubt that the fire has been wilful, but are not in possession of\r\nlegal evidence sufficient to substantiate a charge against the offender.\r\nIn most of these instances, however, the insured has _his reasons_ for\r\ntaking a much smaller sum than he originally demanded. Lastly, we have the\r\n\"unknown,\" to which 1,323 cases are put down, one of the largest numbers\r\nin the entire list, though decreasing year by year. Even of these, a\r\ncertain percentage are supposed to be wilful. There is no denying that the\r\ncrime of arson owes its origin entirely to the introduction of fire\r\ninsurance; and there can be as little doubt that, of late years, it has\r\nbeen very much increased by the pernicious competition for business among\r\nthe younger offices, which leads them to deal too leniently with their\r\ncustomers; or, in other words, to pay the money, _and ask no questions_.\r\nIt is calculated that _one fire in seven which occur among the small class\r\nof shopkeepers in London is an incendiary fire_. Mr. Braidwood, whose\r\nexperience is larger than that of any person, tells us that the greatest\r\ningenuity is sometimes exercised to deceive the officers of the insurance\r\ncompany as to the value of the insured stock. In one instance, when the\r\nBrigade had succeeded in extinguishing the fire, he discovered a string\r\nstretched across one of the rooms in the basement of the house, on which\r\nringlets of shavings dipped in turpentine were tied at regular intervals.\r\nOn extending his investigations, he ascertained that a vast pile of what\r\nhe thought were pounds of moist sugar consisted of parcels of brown paper,\r\nand that the loaves of white sugar were made of plaster of Paris. Ten to\r\none but the \"artful dodge,\" which some scoundrel flatters himself is\r\npeculiarly his own, has been put in practice by hundreds of others before\r\nhim. For this reason, fires that are wilful generally betray themselves to\r\nthe practised eye of the Brigade. When an event of the kind \"is going to\r\nhappen\" at home, a common circumstance is to find that the fond parent has\r\ntreated the whole of his family to the theatre.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of incendiary fires which arise from a species of\r\nmonomania in boys and girls. Not many years ago the men of the Brigade\r\nwere occupied for hours in putting out no less than half a dozen fires\r\nwhich broke out one after another in a house in West Smithfield; and it\r\nwas at last discovered that they were occasioned by a youth who went about\r\nwith lucifers and slily ignited everything that would burn. He was caught\r\nin the act of firing a curtain in the very room in which a fireman was\r\noccupied in putting out a blaze. A still more extraordinary case took\r\nplace in the year 1848, at Torluck House, in the Isle of Mull. On Sunday,\r\nthe 11th of November, the curtains of a bed were ignited, as was supposed\r\nby lightning; a window-blind followed; and immediately afterwards the\r\ncurtains of five rooms broke out one after another into a flame; even the\r\ntowels hanging up in the kitchen were burnt. The next day a bed took fire,\r\nand it being thought advisable to carry the bed-linen into the coach-house\r\nfor safety, it caught fire three or four times during the process of\r\nremoval. In a few days the phenomenon was renewed. The furniture, books,\r\nand everything else of an inflammable nature, were, with much labour,\r\ntaken from the mansion, and again some body-linen burst into a flame on\r\nthe way. Even after these precautions had been taken, and persons had been\r\nset to watch in every part of the house, the mysterious fires continued to\r\nhaunt it until the 22nd of February, 1849. It was suspected from the first\r\nthat they were the act of an incendiary, and upon a rigid examination of\r\nthe household before the Fiscal-General and the Sheriff, the mischief was\r\ntraced to the daughter of the housekeeper, a young girl, who was on a\r\nvisit to her mother. She had effected her purpose, which was perfectly\r\nmotiveless, by concealing combustibles in different parts of the house.\r\n\r\nThe most ludicrous conflagration that perhaps ever occurred was that at\r\nMr. Phillips's workshops, when the whole of his stock of instruments for\r\nextinguishing flame were at one fell swoop destroyed. \"'Tis rare to see\r\nthe engineer hoist with his own petard,\" says the poet; and certainly it\r\nwas a most laughable _contre-temps_ to see the fire-engines arrive at the\r\nmanufactory just in time to witness the fire-annihilators annihilated by\r\nthe fire. A similar mishap occurred to these unfortunate implements at\r\nParis. In juxtaposition with this case, we are tempted to put another, in\r\nwhich the attempt at extinction was followed by exactly the opposite\r\neffects. A tradesman was about to light his gas, when, finding the cock\r\nstiff, he took a candle to see what was the matter; whilst attempting to\r\nturn it, the screw came out, and with it a jet of gas, which was instantly\r\nfired by the candle. The blaze igniting the shop, a passer-by seized a\r\nwooden pail and threw its contents upon the flames, which flared up\r\nimmediately with tenfold power. It is scarcely necessary to state that the\r\nwater was whisky, and that the country was Old Ireland.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous combustion is at present very little understood, though\r\nchemists have of late turned their attention to the subject. It forms,\r\nhowever, no inconsiderable item in the list of causes of fires. There can\r\nbe no question that many of those that occur at railway stations and\r\nbuildings are due to the fermentation which arises among oiled rags.\r\nOver-heating of waste, which includes shoddy, sawdust, cotton, &c., is a\r\nfearful source of conflagrations. The cause of most fires which have\r\narisen from spontaneous combustion is lost in the consequence. Cases now\r\nand then occur where the firemen have been able to detect it, as, for\r\ninstance, at Hibernia Wharf in 1846, one of Alderman Humphery's\r\nwarehouses. It happened that a porter had swept the sawdust from the floor\r\ninto a heap, upon which a broken flask of olive-oil that was placed above\r\ndripped its contents. To these elements of combustion the sun added its\r\npower, and sixteen hours afterwards the fire broke out. Happily, it was\r\ninstantly extinguished; and the agents that produced it were caught,\r\nred-handed as it were, in the act. The chances are that such a particular\r\ncombination of circumstances might not occur again in a thousand years.\r\nThe sawdust will not be swept again into such a position under the oil, or\r\nthe bottle will not break over the sawdust, or the sun will not shine in\r\non them to complete the fatal sum. It is an important fact, however, to\r\nknow that oiled sawdust, warmed by the sun, will fire in sixteen hours, as\r\nit accounts for a number of conflagrations in saw-mills, which never could\r\nbe traced to any probable cause.\r\n\r\nBy means of direct experiment we are also learning something on the\r\nquestion of explosions. It used to be assumed that gunpowder was\r\nanswerable for all such terrible effects in warehouses where no gas or\r\nsteam was employed; and as policies are vitiated by the fact of its\r\npresence, unless declared, many squabbles have ensued between insurers and\r\ninsured upon this head alone. At the late great fire at Gateshead, a\r\nreport having spread that the awful explosion which did so much damage\r\narose from the illicit stowage of seven tons of gunpowder in the Messrs.\r\nSisson's warehouse, the interested insurance companies offered a reward of\r\n100_l._ to elicit information. The experiments instituted, however, by Mr.\r\nPattinson, in the presence of Captain Du Cane, of the Royal Engineers, and\r\nthe coroner's jury impanelled to inquire into the matter, showed that the\r\nwater from the fire-engine falling upon the mineral and chemical\r\nsubstances in store, was sufficient to account for the result. The\r\nfollowing were the experiments tried at Mr. Pattinson's works at Felling,\r\nabout three miles from Gateshead:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Pattinson first caused a metal pot to be inserted in the ground\r\n    until its top was level with the surface; and having put into it 9\r\n    lbs. of nitrate of soda and 6 lbs. of sulphur, he ignited the mass;\r\n    and then, heating it to the highest possible degree of which it was\r\n    susceptible, he poured into it about a quart of water. The effect was\r\n    an immediate explosion (accompanied by a loud clap), which would have\r\n    been exceedingly perilous to any person in its immediate vicinity. The\r\n    experiment was next made under different conditions. The pot into\r\n    which the sulphur and nitrate of soda were put was covered over the\r\n    top with a large piece of thick metal of considerable weight; and\r\n    above that again were placed several large pieces of clay and earth.\r\n    It was deemed necessary to try this experiment in an open field, away\r\n    from any dwelling-house, and which admitted of the spectators placing\r\n    themselves at a safe distance from the spot. The materials were then\r\n    ignited as before; and when in the incandescent state, water was\r\n    poured upon the mass down a spout. The result was but a comparatively\r\n    slight explosion, and which scarcely disturbed the iron and clods\r\n    placed over the mouth of the vessel. Another experiment of the kind\r\n    was made with the same result. At length, a trial having been made for\r\n    the third time, but with this difference, that the vessel was covered\r\n    over the top with another similar vessel, and that the water was\r\n    poured upon the burning sulphur and nitrate of soda with greater\r\n    rapidity than before, by slightly elevating the spout, the effect was\r\n    to blow up the pot on the top into the air to a height of upwards of\r\n    seventy feet, accompanied by a loud detonation. With this the coroner\r\n    and jury became convinced that, whether or not the premises in\r\n    Hillgate contained gunpowder, they contained elements as certainly\r\n    explosive, and perhaps far more destructive.\"\r\n\r\nWe may here mention, as a curious result of the Gateshead fire, that\r\nseveral tons of lead, whilst flowing in a molten state, came in contact\r\nwith a quantity of volatilized sulphur. Thus the lead became re-converted\r\ninto lead-ore, or a sulphuret of lead, which, as it required to be\r\nre-smelted, was thereby debased in value from some twenty-two to fifteen\r\nshillings a ton.\r\n\r\nThe great fire, again, which occurred in Liverpool in October last, was\r\noccasioned by the explosion of spirits of turpentine, which blew out, one\r\nafter another, seven of the walls of the vaults underneath the warehouse,\r\nand in some cases destroyed the vaulting itself, and exposed to the flames\r\nthe stores of cotton above. Surely some law is called for to prevent the\r\njuxtaposition of such inflammable materials. The turpentine is said to\r\nhave been fired by a workman who snuffed the candle with his fingers, and\r\naccidentally threw the snuff down the bunghole of one of the barrels of\r\nturpentine. The warehouses burnt were built upon Mr. Fairbairn's new\r\nfireproof plan, which the Liverpool people introduced some years ago, at a\r\ngreat expense to the town.\r\n\r\nWater alone brought into sudden contact with red-hot iron is capable of\r\ngiving rise to a gas of the most destructive nature--witness the\r\nextraordinary explosions that are continually taking place in\r\nsteam-vessels, especially in America, which mostly arise from the lurching\r\nof the vessel when waiting for passengers, causing the water to withdraw\r\nfrom one side of the boiler, which rapidly becomes red hot. The next lurch\r\nin an opposite direction precipitates the water upon the highly-heated\r\nsurface, and thus the explosive gas, in addition to the steam, is\r\ngenerated faster than the safety-valves can get rid of it.\r\n\r\nA very interesting inquiry, and one of vital importance to the actuaries\r\nof fire-insurance companies, is the relative liability to fire of\r\ndifferent classes of occupations and residences. We already know\r\naccurately the number of fires which occur yearly in every trade and kind\r\nof occupation. What we do not know, and what we want to know, is the\r\nproportion the tenements in which such trades and occupations are carried\r\non, bear to the total number of houses in the metropolis. The last census\r\ngives us no information of this kind, and we trust the omission will be\r\nsupplied the next time it is taken. According to Mr. Braidwood's returns,\r\nfor the last twenty-one years, the number of fires in each trade, and in\r\nprivate houses, has been as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Private Houses                        4,638\r\n  Lodgings                              1,304\r\n  Victuallers                             715\r\n  Sale-shops and Offices                  701\r\n  Carpenters and Workers in Wood          621\r\n  Drapers, of Woollen and Linen           372\r\n  Bakers                                  311\r\n  Stables                                 277\r\n  Cabinet-makers                          233\r\n  Oil and Colour-men                      230\r\n  Chandlers                               178\r\n  Grocers                                 162\r\n  Tinmen, Braziers, and Smiths            158\r\n  Houses under Repair and Building        150\r\n  Beershops                               142\r\n  Coffee-shops and Chophouses             139\r\n  Brokers and Dealers in Old Clothes      134\r\n  Hatmakers                               127\r\n  Lucifer-match makers                    120\r\n  Wine and Spirit Merchants               118\r\n  Tailors                                 113\r\n  Hotels and Club-houses                  107\r\n  Tobacconists                            105\r\n  Eating-houses                           104\r\n  Booksellers and Binders                 103\r\n  Ships                                   102\r\n  Printers and Engravers                  102\r\n  Builders                                 91\r\n  Houses unoccupied                        89\r\n  Tallow-chandlers                         87\r\n  Marine Store Dealers                     75\r\n  Saw-mills                                67\r\n  Firework-makers                          66\r\n  Warehouses                               63\r\n  Chemists                                 62\r\n  Coachmakers                              50\r\n  Warehouses (Manchester)                  49\r\n  Public Buildings                         46\r\n\r\nIf we look at the mere number of fires, irrespective of the size of the\r\nindustrial group upon which they committed their ravages, houses would\r\nappear to be hazardous according to the order in which we have placed\r\nthem. Now, this is manifestly absurd, inasmuch as private houses stand at\r\nthe head of the list, and it is well known that they are the safest from\r\nfire of all kinds of tenements. Mr. Brown, of the Society of Actuaries,\r\nwho has taken the trouble to compare the number of fires in each\r\nindustrial group, with the number of houses devoted to it, as far as he\r\ncould find any data in the Post-office Directory, gives the following\r\naverage annual percentage of conflagrations, calculated on a period of\r\nfifteen years:--\r\n\r\n  Lucifer-match makers               30·00\r\n  Lodging-houses                     16·51\r\n  Hatmakers                           7·74\r\n  Chandlers                           3·88\r\n  Drapers                             2·67\r\n  Tinmen, Braziers, and Smiths        2·42\r\n  Carpenters                          2·27\r\n  Cabinet-makers                      2·12\r\n  Oil and Colour-men                  1·56\r\n  Beershops                           1·31\r\n  Booksellers                         1·18\r\n  Coffee-shops and Coffee-houses      1·2\r\n  Cabinet-makers                      1·12\r\n  Licensed Victuallers                 ·86\r\n  Bakers                               ·75\r\n  Wine Merchants                       ·61\r\n  Grocers                              ·34\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this estimate in a great measure inverts the order of\r\n\"dangerous,\" as we have ranged them in the previous table, making those\r\nwhich from their aggregate number seemed to be the most hazardous trades,\r\nappear the least so, and _vice versâ_. Thus lucifer-match makers have a\r\nbad pre-eminence; indeed they are supposed to be subject to a\r\nconflagration every third year; while the terrible victuallers,\r\ncarpenters, mercers, and bakers, at the top of the column, shrink to the\r\nbottom of the list. These conclusions, nevertheless, are only an\r\napproximation to the truth, since it is impossible to procure a correct\r\nreturn of the houses occupied by different trades. Even if a certain class\r\nof tenements is particularly liable to fire, it does not follow that it\r\nwill be held to be very hazardous to the insurers. Such considerations are\r\ninfluenced by another question,--Are the contents of houses forming the\r\ngroup, of that nature that, in cases of their taking fire, they are likely\r\nto be totally destroyed, seriously, or only slightly damaged? For\r\ninstance, lodging-houses are very liable to fire; but they are very seldom\r\nburnt down or much injured. Out of 81 that suffered in 1853, not one was\r\ntotally destroyed; only 4 were extensively affected; the very large\r\nmajority, 77, were slightly scathed from the burning of window and bed\r\ncurtains, &c. Among the trades which are too hazardous to be insured at\r\nany price are--we quote from the tariff of the County\r\nFire-office--floor-cloth manufacturers, gunpowder dealers, hatters' \"stock\r\nin the stove,\" lampblack makers, lucifer-match makers, varnish makers, and\r\nwadding manufacturers; whilst the following are considered highly\r\nhazardous;--bone-crushers, coffee-roasters, composition-ornament makers,\r\ncurriers, dyers, feather-stovers, flambeau makers, heckling-houses, hemp\r\nand flax dressers, ivory-black makers, japanners and japan makers,\r\nlaboratory-chemists, patent japan-leather manufacturers, lint-mills,\r\nrough-fat melters, musical-instrument makers, oil and colour men, leather\r\ndressers, oiled-silk and linen makers, oil of vitriol manufacturers, pitch\r\nmakers, rag dealers, resin dealers, saw-mills, seed crushers,\r\nship-buiscuit bakers, soap makers, spermaceti and wax refiners, sugar\r\nrefiners, tar dealers and boilers, thatched houses in towns, and\r\nturpentine makers.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of these trades bear \"hazardous\" upon the very face of\r\nthem; but it is not equally apparent why that of a hatter should be so\r\nvery dangerous, and particular portions of his stock uninsurable. We are\r\ngiven to understand that the stoves at which their manufacture is carried\r\non, and the shell-lac and willow, are the causes of this proneness to\r\nconflagrations. The memorable fire at Fenning's Wharf, which burnt with a\r\nfury to which that at the Royal Exchange and at the Houses of Parliament\r\nwas a mere bonfire, originated at a hatter's on London Bridge, from which\r\nplace it speedily spread to Alderman Humphery's warehouses in the rear,\r\nleaped across Tooley Street--at this spot 60 feet wide--and thus invaded\r\nthe great river-side wharf. The two floating-engines belonging to the\r\nbrigade were brought into service on the occasion, and although they threw\r\nbetween them fourteen hundred gallons of water a minute to the height of a\r\nhundred feet, they had not the slightest effect upon the burning mass.\r\n\r\nNothing shows better the relative degrees of hazard than the different\r\nrates charged for insurance. Thus an ordinary dwelling-house pays but\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ per cent., while a sugar-refinery pays at least two, and\r\nsometimes three guineas per cent., or from 30 to 40 times as much. The\r\nsame class of houses pay different rates according to their locality. The\r\nresidence which is charged 1_s._ 6_d._ in London, is, in St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland--a town famous, or rather infamous, for fires--charged by our\r\nEnglish offices 1_l._ 11_s._ 6_d._ per cent. Probably the heaviest loss\r\nthe Phoenix Office ever sustained was by the fire of St. John's, in 1846.\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact, that the city of London, which is perhaps the most\r\ndensely inhabited spot the world has ever seen, has long been exempt from\r\nconflagrations involving a considerable number of houses. \"The devouring\r\nelement,\" it is true, has made many meals from time to time of huge\r\nwarehouses and public buildings; but since the great fire of 1666 it has\r\nceased to gorge upon whole quarters of the town. We have never had, since\r\nthat memorable occasion, to record the destruction of a thousand houses at\r\na time, a matter of frequent occurrence in the United States and\r\nCanada--indeed in all parts of Continental Europe. The fires which have\r\nproved fatal to large plots of buildings in the metropolis have in every\r\ninstance taken place without the sound of Bow bells. A comparison between\r\nthe number of fires which occurred between the years 1838 and 1843, in\r\n20,000 houses situate on either side of the Thames, shows at once the\r\nsuperior safety of its northern bank, the annual average of fires on the\r\nlatter being only 20 against 36 on the southern side. For this exemption\r\nwe have to thank the great disaster, if we might so term what has turned\r\nout a blessing. At one fell swoop it cleared the city, and swept away for\r\never the dangerous congregation of wooden buildings and narrow streets\r\nwhich were always affording material for the flame.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Cunningham, in his \"Handbook of London,\"[43] gives the following\r\ncurious information respecting its supposed origin:--\r\n\r\n    \"The fire of London, commonly called the Great Fire, commenced on the\r\n    east side of this lane (Pudding-lane) about one or two in the morning\r\n    of Sunday, September 2nd, 1666, in the house of Farryner, the king's\r\n    baker.\r\n\r\n    \"It was the fashion of the true blue Protestants of the period to\r\n    attribute the fire to the Roman Catholics; and when, in 1681, Oates\r\n    and his plot strengthened this belief, the following inscription was\r\n    affixed on the front of this house (No. 25, I believe), erected on the\r\n    site of Farryner, the baker's:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Here, by the permission of Heaven, hell broke loose upon this\r\n    Protestant city, from the malicious hearts of barbarous priests, by\r\n    the hand of their agent, Hubert, who confessed, and on the ruins of\r\n    this place declared the fact for which he was hanged, viz., that here\r\n    began that dreadful fire which is described on and perpetuated by the\r\n    neighbouring pillar, erected anno 1681, in the mayoralty of Sir Peter\r\n    Ward, knight.'\r\n\r\n    \"This celebrated inscription, set up pursuant to an order of the Court\r\n    of Common Council, June 17th, 1681, was removed in the reign of James\r\n    II., replaced in the reign of William III., and finally taken down 'on\r\n    account of the stoppage of passengers to read it.' Entick, who makes\r\n    addition to Maitland in 1756, speaks of it 'as lately taken away.' The\r\n    house was 'rebuilt in a very handsome manner.'\r\n\r\n    \"The inscribed stone is still preserved, it is said, in a cellar in\r\n    Pudding-lane. Hubert was a French papist, of six-and-twenty years of\r\n    age, the son of a watchmaker at Rouen, in Normandy. He was seized in\r\n    Essex, confessed he began the fire, and, persisting in his confession,\r\n    was hanged, upon no other evidence than his own. He stated in his\r\n    examination that he had been 'suborned in Paris to this action,' and\r\n    that three more 'combined to do the same thing. They asked him if he\r\n    knew the place where he first put fire. He answered he knew it very\r\n    well, and would show it to anybody.' He was then ordered to be\r\n    blindfolded, and carried to several places of the City, that he might\r\n    point out the house. They first led him to a place at some distance\r\n    from it, opened his eyes, and asked him if that was it; to which he\r\n    answered, 'No, it was nearer the Thames.' 'The house and all which\r\n    were near it,' says Clarendon, 'were so covered and buried in ruins,\r\n    that the owners themselves, without some infallible mark, could very\r\n    hardly have said where their own house had stood; but this man led\r\n    them directly to the place, described how it stood, the shape of the\r\n    little yard, the fashion of the doors and windows, and where he first\r\n    put the fire; and all this with such exactness, that they who had\r\n    dwelt long near it could not so perfectly have described all\r\n    particulars.' Tillotson told Burnet that Howell (the then Recorder of\r\n    London) accompanied Hubert on this occasion, 'was with him and had\r\n    much discourse with him, and that he concluded it was impossible it\r\n    could be a melancholy dream.' This, however, was not the opinion of\r\n    the judges who tried him. 'Neither the judges,' says Clarendon, 'nor\r\n    any present at the trial, did believe him guilty, but that he was a\r\n    poor distracted wretch, weary of his life, and chose to part with it\r\n    in this way.' We may attribute the fire with safety to another cause\r\n    than a Roman conspiracy. We are to remember that the flames originated\r\n    in the house of a baker; that the season had been unusually dry; that\r\n    the houses were of wood, overhanging the road-way (penthouses they\r\n    were called), so that the lane was even narrower than it is now, and\r\n    that a strong east wind was blowing at the time. It was thought very\r\n    little of at first. Pepys put out his head from his bedroom window in\r\n    Seething-lane, a few hours after it broke out, and returned to bed\r\n    again, as if it were nothing more than an ordinary fire, a common\r\n    occurrence, and likely to be soon subdued. The Lord Mayor (Sir Thomas\r\n    Bludworth) seems to have thought as little of it till it was too late.\r\n    People appear to have been paralyzed, and no attempt of any\r\n    consequence was made to check its progress. For four successive days\r\n    it raged and gained ground, leaping after a prodigious manner from\r\n    house to house and street to street, at great distances from one\r\n    another. Houses were at length pulled down, and the flames, still\r\n    spreading westward, were at length stopped at the Temple Church in\r\n    Fleet-street, and Pie-Corner in Smithfield. In these four days 13,200\r\n    houses, 400 streets, and 89 churches, including the cathedral church\r\n    of St. Paul, were destroyed, and London lay literally in ruins. The\r\n    loss was so enormous, that we may be said still to suffer from its\r\n    effects. Yet the advantages were not few. London was freed from the\r\n    plague ever after; and we owe St. Paul's, St. Bride's, St. Stephen's\r\n    Walbrook, and all the architectural glories of Sir Christopher Wren,\r\n    to the desolation it occasioned.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to these advantages we acquired another, that of\r\nPARTY-WALLS--a safeguard which has prevented fires from spreading in the\r\nCity, when whole streets have been swept away in a few hours in other\r\nparts of the metropolis, and especially in what might be termed the\r\nwater-side suburbs of London--Rotherhithe, Greenwich, and Gravesend. The\r\nAct by which party-walls were enforced came into operation immediately\r\nprior to the rebuilding of the town, and has been rendered more stringent\r\nand effective from time to time by various amendments. The Building Act of\r\nthe 7th and 8th of Queen Victoria contains the important enactment, that\r\n\"no warehouse shall exceed 200,000 cubic feet in contents.\" Fire becomes\r\nunmanageable when it has access to large stores of combustible matter;\r\nunder such conditions it acquires a \"fortified position,\" and cannot, in\r\nthe vast majority of cases, be reduced unless by an early surprise.\r\n\r\nAs the very heart of London is largely occupied with Manchester warehouses\r\nfull of the most inflammable materials, the safety of the capital depends\r\nupon this restrictive law. The Manchester warehousemen, nevertheless, have\r\nmanaged to set that part of the Act at defiance. Let us take, as the\r\nlatest and most flagrant example, Cook's warehouses. This structure, which\r\nwithin these last two years has raised its enormous bulk in St. Paul's\r\nChurchyard, and actually dwarfed the metropolitan cathedral by the\r\npropinquity of its monotonous mass, contains 1,100,000 cubic feet of space\r\nopen from end to end, or _nine hundred thousand feet more than it is\r\nentitled to possess_. If we were to take twenty-five ordinary-sized\r\ndwelling-houses, and pull down their party-walls, we should have just the\r\nstate of things which is here presented to us. But it will be asked, if it\r\nis against the law, why do not the proper officers interfere? Where are\r\nthe City surveyors? The reason, good reader, is this: the Manchester\r\nwarehousemen of late years have adopted a new reading of the law--a\r\nreading which we believe no judge would allow, but which the surveyors\r\nhave not yet ventured to dispute. \"We escape altogether,\" say these\r\ngentlemen, \"the provisions of the Building Act relative to warehouses, as,\r\nby reason of our breaking bulk, our places of business are not mere\r\nstorehouses.\" That this reading is a violation of the spirit of the\r\nstatute there can be no doubt; that it is also a violation of its letter\r\nwe also believe; if not, it is high time that the law be amended upon this\r\npoint; for we affirm, on the very best authority, that London has never\r\nsince the great fire been in such danger of an overwhelming conflagration\r\nas it is now by the presence and rapid spreading of these huge warehouses,\r\nfilled with the elements of destruction, and placed side by side, as\r\nthough for the very purpose of producing the utmost mischief by contagion.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, for instance, that a fire had once established itself in\r\nCook's warehouses; to extinguish it would be out of the question.\r\nFire-engines would be perfectly useless against a body of flame which\r\nwould speedily become like a blast-furnace, and burn with a white heat.\r\nWho knows what would come after? Supposing the wind to be blowing from the\r\nsouth, we tremble for the cathedral. The huge dome is constructed entirely\r\nof oak, dried by the seasoning of 150 years, and the combustible framework\r\nis only lined on the exterior by sheet lead. It may be imagined that this\r\nwould be protection enough against the enormous masses of burning cotton\r\nand linen cloth which would speedily be blown upon it; but Mr. Cottam not\r\nlong since stated, at the Institution of Civil Engineers, that, \"when the\r\nPrincess's Theatre was on fire, part of his premises also caught. On\r\nexamination, he found that it arose from a piece of blazing wood being\r\nthrown over from the theatre, which, falling into the leaden gutter, had\r\nmelted it, and the liquid metal passed through the ceiling on to a\r\nworkman's bench, where there was some oil, which it immediately set fire\r\nto.\" The great dome would be in quite as much danger as Mr. Cottam's\r\nworkshop. Engines would be useless at such a height even as the stone\r\ngallery, the place where large bodies of burning material would most\r\nlikely make a lodgment. Irreparable as would be the disaster with which we\r\nare threatened in this direction, one quite as great lies in another.\r\nEastward of Cook's warehouses, and in the neighbourhood of a vitriol or\r\nsome other chemical manufactory, is situated Doctors' Commons, the\r\nrepository of the great mass of English wills. The roofs of this pile of\r\nbuildings[44] are continuous; the buildings themselves are nearly as dry\r\nas the law itself. If one portion of the structure were to catch fire,\r\nnothing could save the whole from destruction. It may be urged that the\r\nblock of buildings, which commands, like a battery, two such important\r\npoints in the metropolis, is, after all, fire-proof, and, as far as danger\r\nfrom without is concerned, this is true enough; but as cotton bales are\r\nnot fire-proof, it is an impossibility to insure safety from within. Iron\r\ncolumns in such instances melt before the white heat like sticks of\r\nsealing-wax; stone flies into a thousand pieces with the celerity of a\r\nPrince Rupert's drop; slate becomes transformed into a pumice light enough\r\nto float upon water; the iron girders and beams, by reason of their\r\nlateral expansion, thrust out the walls; and the very elements, which seem\r\ncalculated under ordinary circumstances to give an almost exhaustless\r\ndurability to the structure, produce its most rapid destruction. The great\r\nfire at Messrs. Cubitt's so-called fire-proof works at Pimlico is one of\r\nthe latest proofs we have had of the entire fallacy of supposing stone and\r\niron can withstand the action of a large body of fierce flame. We saw the\r\nother day portions of columns from this building fused as though they had\r\nbeen composed of so much pewter. Again, when the Armoury of the Tower was\r\ndestroyed, the barrels of the muskets were found reduced to the most\r\nfantastic shapes, and some of the largest pieces of ordnance were doubled\r\nup. A stronger instance still was exhibited at Davis's wharf in 1837, when\r\na cast-iron pipe outside the building was melted like an icicle. But such\r\na fierce furnace is not at all necessary to destroy cast-iron supports, as\r\nit appears from the experiments of Mr. Fairbairn, that, at a temperature\r\nof 600° the cohesive power of the metal rapidly decreases with every\r\nincrement of heat. Mr. Braidwood, in his paper on fire-proof buildings,\r\nread before the Institute of Civil Engineers on February 29th, 1849, was\r\nthe first, we believe, to draw attention to this serious defect in a\r\nmaterial used so extensively in modern buildings. Since that paper was\r\nread, a case has come under his notice which clearly testifies to the\r\ntruth of his position:--\r\n\r\n    \"A chapel in Liverpool-road Islington, 70 feet in length and 52 feet\r\n    in breadth, took fire in the cellar, on the 2nd October, 1848, and was\r\n    completely burned down. After the fire it was ascertained that, of\r\n    thirteen cast-iron pillars used to support the galleries, only two\r\n    remained perfect; the greater part of the others were broken into\r\n    small pieces, the metal appearing to have lost all power of cohesion,\r\n    and some parts were melted, of which specimens are now shown. It\r\n    should be observed that these pillars were of ample strength to\r\n    support the galleries when filled by the congregation, but when the\r\n    fire reached them, they crumbled under the weight of the timber only,\r\n    lightened as it must have been by the progress of the fire.\"\r\n\r\nBut when we are considering the safety of Manchester warehouses, we are\r\nalso considering the lives of the young men who are employed in them, and\r\nare in most cases located in the upper stories. In several of the\r\nwholesale warehouses in the City, as Mr. Braidwood informs us,--\r\n\r\n    \"The cast-iron pillars are much less in proportion to the weight to be\r\n    carried than those referred to, and would be completely in the draught\r\n    of a fire. If a fire should unfortunately take place under such\r\n    circumstances, the loss of human life might be very great, as the\r\n    chance of fifty, eighty, or one hundred people escaping, in the\r\n    confusion of a sudden night alarm, by one or two ladders to the roof,\r\n    could scarcely be calculated on, and the time such escape might\r\n    necessarily occupy, independent of all chance of accidents, would be\r\n    considerable.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of water would only aggravate the difficulty, for, if it\r\ntouched the red-hot iron, in all probability it would cause it to fracture\r\nand render it useless as a support. It is well known that furnace-bars are\r\nvery speedily destroyed by a leakage of the boiler, the effect of the\r\nsteam on the under side of the bars being to curve and twist them. To\r\ninsure a perfectly fire-proof building, we must resort to one of two\r\ncourses--either we must divide large warehouses into compartments by solid\r\nbrick divisions, and thus confine any fire that should happen to break out\r\nwithin manageable limits, just as we save an iron ship from foundering, on\r\naccount of a circumscribed fracture, by having her built in compartments;\r\nor we must resort to the old Roman plan of building--that is, support the\r\nfloors upon brick piers and groined arches well laid in cement, for mortar\r\nwill pulverize under a great heat. The former plan has the great advantage\r\nthat it insures the safety of the principal contents, as well as of the\r\nbuilding itself. The new Record Office in Fetter Lane, is a perfect\r\nspecimen of the kind, and is, perhaps, the only absolutely fire-proof\r\nstructure in England, being constructed of iron and stone, and having no\r\nroom larger than 17 feet by 25, and 17 feet high, with a cubical contents\r\nof only 8,000 feet. None of the rooms open into each other, but into a\r\nvaulted passage by means of iron doors; and if the documents were to take\r\nfire in any one of them, they would burn out as innocuously to the rest of\r\nthe building as coals in a grate.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that we disparage altogether the use of iron and\r\nstone in the erection of warehouses, even where they are built on the\r\nordinary plan; for the outside structure they are invaluable, and render\r\nit safe from most extraneous danger. No better proof of this could be\r\ngiven than the experience of Liverpool, whose fires during the last\r\nhalf-century have been on the most gigantic scale. The larger bonded and\r\nother warehouses were generally built with continuous roofs, and with\r\nwooden doors and penthouses to the different stories, which always kindled\r\nwhen there was a fire on the opposite side of the narrow streets in which\r\nthey were ordinarily placed. To such a lamentable extent had\r\nconflagrations increased about the year 1841, that the rate of insurance,\r\nwhich had been eight shillings per cent., ran up to thirty-six shillings.\r\nThis was about the time of the Formby Street fire, when 379,000_l._ worth\r\nof property was destroyed, and the total losses from the beginning of the\r\ncentury had not been less than three millions and a quarter sterling. The\r\nmagnitude of the evil called for a corresponding remedy. A Bill was\r\nobtained in 1843 for the amendment of the Building Act; party-walls were\r\nrun up five feet high between each warehouse, doors and penthouses were\r\nconstructed of iron, the cubical contents of the buildings themselves were\r\nlimited, &c.; and the effect of these improvements was so to diminish the\r\nrisk that insurances fell to their normal rate. It cannot be said,\r\nhowever, that Liverpool has yet purged herself of the calamity of fire.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary dwellings and in public offices the use of iron and stone,\r\nagain, cannot be too much commended: in such buildings the rooms are\r\ncomparatively small, and their contents are not sufficiently inflammable\r\neither in quantity or quality to injure these materials. A marked\r\ndiminution in the number of fires in the metropolis may be expected, from\r\nthe almost universal use of iron and stone in new structures of this\r\nkind. The houses in Victoria Street, Westminster, built upon the \"flat\"\r\nsystem, are, we should say, entirely fireproof, as the floors are either\r\nvaulted or filled in with concrete, which will not allow the passage of\r\nfire. Nearly all Paris is built in this manner, and hence its freedom from\r\nlarge conflagrations.[45] Were it not for this, no city would be more\r\nlikely to suffer, as the houses are very high, and the supply of water\r\nextremely bad. To Londoners it seems little better than a farce to watch\r\nthe _sapeurs-pompiers_ hurrying to a fire with an engine not much bigger\r\nthan a garden squirt, followed by a water-barrel--resources which are\r\nfound sufficient to cope with the enemy, confined as it is within such\r\nnarrow limits.\r\n\r\nWithout going to the expense of stone and iron, we might, by taking a hint\r\nfrom the Parisians, make the rooms of our private houses fireproof, by\r\nabandoning the absurd custom of separating rooms by hollow wooden floors\r\nand hollow wooden partitions thinly coated with plaster--a method which\r\nhas the effect of circulating the fire from the bottom to the top of the\r\nhouse in the quickest possible space of time. If a fire breaks out in a\r\nroom, the ceiling will, it is true, stop the flames for a considerable\r\ntime; but the hollow partitions full of air act as conductors, and the\r\nfiremen have often found that the flames have spread from a lower to an\r\nupper apartment by this secret channel, without injuring the intermediate\r\nrooms, and without even its progress being suspected. As we understand\r\nthat the Building Act is to be amended, we trust its emendators will\r\nextend the clause relating to party-walls to _rooms_ as well as to houses.\r\nThe expense need be but trifling, as will be seen by consulting the little\r\nwork of Mr. Hosking, who was the first, we believe, to instruct the\r\nEnglish public in the admirable methods of the Parisian builders. Instead\r\nof using flimsy laths for their partitions, they employ stout oaken pieces\r\nof wood, as thick as garden palings; these they nail firmly on each side\r\nof the framing of the partition, fill the space between with rubble and\r\nplaster of Paris, and thickly coat the whole of the wall with the latter.\r\nThe floors are managed in the same manner, as well as the under side of\r\nthe stairs, which are thus rendered almost as fire-proof as a stone\r\nflight. Very many lives would be saved in Great Britain if this simple\r\nexpedient were adopted by our builders, instead of making the stairs of\r\nill-fitted wood, full of air-crevices, and covering their under side with\r\na thin film of plaster; for fire always makes for the stairs, which form\r\nthe funnel of the house; and hence the necessity for rendering them as\r\nsecure as possible, in order to provide a line of retreat for the inmates.\r\n\r\nWe have said that London is growing upwards to the sky--no house in any\r\nvaluable portion of the metropolis being now rebuilt without the addition\r\nof at least one story. Eighty and ninety feet is getting a common height\r\nfor our great offices and warehouses, which is tantamount to saying that a\r\ncertain portion of the metropolis, and that a constantly increasing one,\r\nis outgrowing the power of the Fire Brigade, as no engine built upon the\r\npresent plan can throw water for many minutes to such an elevation. Mr.\r\nBraidwood foresees that he must call in the aid of the common drudge,\r\nsteam. In America they have already introduced this new agent with some\r\nsuccess, and in London we have proved its power in the floating engine.\r\nSteam fire-engines, it is evident, will soon be brought into use, unless\r\nwe do away with the necessity for engines at all by fixing the hose\r\ndirectly on the mains, as is done at Hamburg. But to effect this it will\r\nbe necessary to relay the whole metropolis with much larger pipes, to\r\nincrease their number, and at the same time adopt the constant-service\r\nsystem. At present, even if we had the water always on, the mains are\r\noften so small as to preclude the use of more than two or three hose--for,\r\nif the collective diameters of the areas of the latter exceed that of the\r\npipe which feeds them, the pressure will cease, and no water will be\r\npropelled to any height through the jet. It cannot be denied, however,\r\nthat if the streets of London were all supplied with capacious mains, and\r\nthe different companies plugged them profusely (a thing they are very\r\nchary of doing, for fear of their being injured by the wear and tear of\r\nthe fire-engines), London would be rendered far more secure than it is at\r\npresent, as scarcely any fire could withstand the full force of constant\r\nstreams of thousands of gallons of water per minute. At present the\r\ngreater portion of the water is wasted; at the destruction of the Houses\r\nof Parliament, a body of this element equal to an acre in area, and twelve\r\nfeet deep, flowed from the mains, a tenth part of which could not have\r\nbeen used by the twenty-three jets that were playing simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIt will not here be out of place to say a few words upon the method of\r\nextinguishing flame by means of the gaseous mixture contained in\r\nPhillips's fire-annihilators. According to a writer in the \"Household\r\nWords,\" the ordinary-sized annihilator is less than that of a small\r\nupright iron coalscuttle, and its weight not greater than can be easily\r\ncarried by man or woman to any part of the house. It is charged with a\r\ncompound of charcoal, nitre, and gypsum, moulded into the form of a large\r\nbrick: the igniter is a glass tube inserted into the top of this brick:\r\ninclosing two phials--one filled with the mixture of chlorate of potassa\r\nand sugar, the other containing a few drops of sulphuric acid. A slight\r\nblow upon a knob drives down a pin which breaks the phials, and the\r\ndifferent mixtures coming in contact ignite the mass, the gas arising from\r\nwhich, acting upon a water-chamber contained in the machine, produces a\r\nsteam, and the whole escapes forth in a dense expanding cloud.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips made some public experiments with his fire-annihilator three\r\nor four years ago, in which its power to put out the fiercest flame was\r\nfully proved. The timber framework of a three storied-house smeared with\r\npitch and tar, upon being fired, was instantly extinguished: quantities of\r\npitch, tar, and oil of turpentine, which only burn the stronger for the\r\npresence of water, were dealt with still more expeditiously. The valuable\r\nquality of rendering an atmosphere of dense smoke, in which no living\r\nthing could exist, perfectly respirable, was also shown in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner. Since that time the machine has been brought into\r\naction at Leeds, where it put out a fire in an attic; and in a very\r\nserious conflagration, which took place in the spirit-room, and afterwards\r\nextended to the main hatchway of the mail steamer the _City of\r\nManchester_, in the autumn of 1852, it was applied with the most perfect\r\nsuccess. There can be no doubt that in all confined places the control of\r\nthe annihilator over flame is omnipotent--acting much more speedily than\r\nwater, and, unlike that element, doing no damage. When the flames are\r\nunconfined, the annihilator will prove of little use, because, the gaseous\r\ncloud that issues from it not being heavier than the air, it cannot be\r\nprojected to any distance. As an auxiliary to the engine, it will be\r\ninvaluable in many cases, as it will enable the fireman to go into places\r\nwhere at present he dares not enter, unless protected by the unwieldy\r\nsmoke-jacket, the supply of air to which might at any time be cut off by\r\nrubbish falling upon the hose through which it is pumped to him by the\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is foreign to our design to speak at length of agricultural\r\nfires, and incendiarism among farming stock, the subject is too important\r\nto be entirely omitted. One of the largest London insurance-offices,\r\ninterested in farming stock, posts up bills about premises they have\r\ninsured, which, after stating that no lucifers are to be used, or pipes\r\nare to be smoked, goes on to say, \"_This farm is insured; the fire office\r\nwill be the only sufferer in the event of a fire._\" The inference is, that\r\nthe labourer will feel more inclined to pay respect to the property of an\r\ninsurance company than to that of the farmer. Yet it is far from being the\r\ncase that the crime is always prompted by personal ill-will. One of the\r\nlargest agricultural incendiaries upon record was a city weaver, who acted\r\nfrom a general spirit of discontent, without any hatred or knowledge of\r\nthe owners. In other instances the sole motive is the \"jollification\"\r\nwhich generally follows a fire upon a farm: this fact came to light at a\r\ntrial in Cambridge, eight or nine years since, when a man who was\r\nsentenced to death for setting fire to a homestead confessed to having\r\ncaused twelve different fires, his only object being the desire to obtain\r\nthe few shillings, and the refreshment of bread, cheese, and ale, which\r\nare given to labourers on these occasions. On the other hand, if the\r\nfarmer determines to give no recompense, the hangers-on have been known to\r\nput their hands in their pockets and watch his property burn with the\r\nutmost indifference, if not with glee.\r\n\r\nThe cause of fire which the farmer has mainly to guard against may be at\r\none seen by the following table, for which we are indebted to the manager\r\nof the County Fire Office:--\r\n\r\n_Losses on Farming Stock between January the 1st and November the 30th,\r\n1853._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Number  |                                         |            |\r\n  |of Fires.|               Cause.                    |  Amount.   |\r\n  |---------|-----------------------------------------|------------|\r\n  |         |                                         |  £.  s. d. |\r\n  |    49   |Incendiary                               | 5214  6 11 |\r\n  |    17   |Lightning                                |  181  5 10 |\r\n  |    22   |Children and others playing with lucifers| 1211 18 10 |\r\n  |     2   |Steam thrashing-machines                 |  430  0  0 |\r\n  |    38   |General                                  | 1781 19  9 |\r\n  |---------|                                         |------------|\r\n  |   128   |                                         | 8819 11  4 |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThese losses are upon a total insurance of eight millions. Incendiarism\r\nand children playing with lucifers are the two grand elements of\r\ndestruction; and the former, we are given to understand, is below the\r\ngeneral average. Kind treatment and better education are the only shields\r\nthat can protect the farmer against incendiarism. The nuisance arising\r\nfrom children playing with lucifers may be abated by the absolute denial\r\nof matches to young boys about a farm, who, to cook their dinners,\r\ngenerally cause conflagrations near the ricks in the winter, and among the\r\nstanding corn whilst \"keeping birds\" in the summer. The following\r\nexcellent suggestions are by Mr. Beaumont, the secretary of the County\r\nFire Office.\r\n\r\n    _Precautions to be taken against a Fire._\r\n\r\n    Forbid your men to use lucifer matches, smoke, or light pipes or\r\n    cigars, destroy wasps' nests, or fire off guns, in or near the\r\n    rickyard, or to throw hot cinders into or against any wooden\r\n    out-building on the farm, on pain of instant dismissal.\r\n\r\n    Place your ricks in a single line, and as far distant from each other\r\n    as you conveniently can.\r\n\r\n    Place hay-ricks and corn-stacks _alternately_; the hay-rick will check\r\n    the progress of the fire.\r\n\r\n    Keep the rickyard, and especially the spaces between the stacks and\r\n    ricks, clear of all loose straw; and in all respects in a neat and\r\n    clean state. The loose straw is more frequently the means of firing\r\n    than the stack itself.\r\n\r\n    Have a pond close to the rickyard, although there may be but a bad\r\n    supply of water.\r\n\r\n    When a steam thrashing-machine is to be used, place it _on the lee\r\n    side_ of the stack or barn, so that the wind may blow the sparks _away\r\n    from_ the stacks. Let the engine be placed as far from the machine as\r\n    the length of the strap will allow. Have the loose straw continually\r\n    cleared away from the engine; see that two or three pails of water are\r\n    constantly close to the ash-pan, and that the pan itself is kept\r\n    constantly full of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _How to act when a Fire has broken out in a Rickyard._\r\n\r\n    Do not wait for the engines, nor for the assistance of the labourers\r\n    from a distance. Depend entirely upon the immediate and energetic\r\n    exertions of yourself and your own men.\r\n\r\n    Do not allow the rick or stack on fire to be disturbed--let it burn\r\n    itself out--but let every exertion be made to press it compactly\r\n    together, and, as far as is practicable, prevent any lighted particles\r\n    flying about.\r\n\r\n    Get together all your blankets, carpets, sacks, rugs, and other\r\n    similar articles, soak them thoroughly in water, and place them over\r\n    and against the adjoining ricks and stacks, towards which the wind\r\n    blows.\r\n\r\n    Having thus covered the sides of the ricks adjoining that on fire,\r\n    devote all your attention to the latter. Press it together by every\r\n    available means. If water is at hand, throw upon it as much as\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\n    If engines arrive, let the water be thrown upon the blankets, &c.,\r\n    covering the adjoining stacks, and then upon the stack on fire.\r\n\r\n    Among the numerous hands who flock to assist upon these occasions,\r\n    many do mischief by their want of knowledge, and especially by opening\r\n    the fired stack and scattering the embers. In order to obviate this\r\n    evil, place your best man in command over the stack on fire, desire\r\n    him to make it _his sole duty_ to prevent it being disturbed, and to\r\n    keep it pressed and watered.\r\n\r\n    Place other men, in whose steadiness you have confidence, to watch the\r\n    adjoining ricks, to keep the coverings over them, and to extinguish\r\n    any embers flying from the stack on fire. In order to effect this, it\r\n    is most desirable that there should be ladders at hand to enable one\r\n    or two of the labourers to mount upon each stack.\r\n\r\n    If the ricks are separated from each other, and there is no danger of\r\n    the fire extending to a second, it is of course desirable to save as\r\n    much of the one on fire as may be possible. That, however, is not\r\n    unfrequently accomplished by keeping the rick compactly together\r\n    rather than by opening it.\r\n\r\n    Send for all the neighbours' blankets and tarpaulins: these are\r\n    invaluable, they are near at hand, and can be immediately applied.\r\n\r\nThe companies are always very willing to pay for any damage done in\r\nattempting to save their property.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Fire Brigade is to protect property and not life from\r\nfire, though the men of course use every exertion to save the inmates, and\r\nare always provided with a \"jumping-sheet\" to catch those who precipitate\r\nthemselves from the roofs and windows of houses. As the danger to life\r\ngenerally arises at a very early stage of a fire, when the freshly aroused\r\ninhabitants fly distracted into very dangerous places, and often destroy\r\nthemselves by needless haste, it is highly necessary to have help at hand\r\nbefore the engines can possibly arrive. There are, it is true, ladders\r\nplaced against all the parish churches, but they are always locked up,\r\noften rotten, and never in charge of trained individuals: accordingly,\r\nthey may be classed for inefficiency with the parish engines. A proof of\r\nthis was given at the calamitous fire which occurred in Dover Street, at\r\nRaggett's Hotel, on which occasion Mrs. Round and several other persons\r\nwere lost through the conduct of the keeper of one of the fire-escapes of\r\nthe parish of St. James being absent when called, and drunk when, upon his\r\narrival, he attempted to put his machine in action: the keeper of a second\r\nescape belonging to this parish, and stationed in Golden Square, refused\r\nto go to a fire in Soho, which occurred in 1852, because it was out of his\r\ndistrict: the consequence was, than seven persons threw themselves from\r\nthe windows and were all more or less dangerously injured.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 the Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, which had\r\nbeen imperfectly organized a year or two before, was fully established,\r\nand has continued to increase the sphere of its influence year by year.\r\nThe committee of management, appreciating the value of celerity in\r\nattending fires, have marked the metropolis out into fifty-five squares of\r\nhalf a mile each: in forty-two of these they have established a\r\nstation,[46] in its most central part, at which a fire-escape and trained\r\nconductor are to be found from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. from Lady-day to\r\nMichaelmas, and from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. from Michaelmas to Lady-day. When\r\nthe remaining thirteen squares are furnished, there will be means of\r\nrescue from fire within a quarter of a mile of every house in London: thus\r\nthe nightly watch for this purpose is better organized with respect to\r\nnumber of stations than even the fire brigade, and, like this force, it is\r\nunder the general management of a single director. We are all familiar\r\nwith the sight of these strange-looking machines as they come towering\r\nalong in the dusk of the evening towards their appointed stations; but few\r\nperhaps have seen them in action or have examined the manner in which they\r\nare constructed. There are several methods of building them, but the one\r\nchiefly used is Wivell's, a very simple machine and speedily put in\r\naction, a description of which we take from the society's report:--\r\n\r\n    \"The main ladder reaches from thirty to thirty-five feet, and can\r\n    instantly be applied to most second-floor windows, by means of the\r\n    carriage lever. The upper ladder folds over the main ladder, and is\r\n    raised easily in the position represented, by a rope attached to its\r\n    lever-irons on either side of the main ladder; or, as recently adopted\r\n    in one or two of the escapes, by an arrangement of pulleys in lieu of\r\n    the lever-irons. The short ladder, for first floors, fits in under the\r\n    carriage, and is often of the greatest service. Under the whole length\r\n    of the main ladder is a canvas trough or bagging, made of stout\r\n    sailcloth, protected by an outer trough of copper-wire net, leaving\r\n    sufficient room between for the yielding of the canvas in a person's\r\n    descent. The addition of the copper-wire is a great improvement, as,\r\n    although not affording an entire protection against the canvas\r\n    burning, it in most cases avails, and prevents the possibility of any\r\n    one falling through. The soaking of the canvas in alum and other\r\n    solutions is attended to; but this, while preventing its flaming,\r\n    cannot avoid the risk of accident from the fire charring the canvas.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the fire-escapes often have to be raised above\r\nwindows from which the flames are pouring forth, it will be seen how\r\nvaluable is this double protection against the destruction of the canvas.\r\nThe necessity for it was shown at a fire in Crawford Street, Marylebone,\r\nwhere an explosion took place which fired the canvas and let the conductor\r\nfall through just as he was rescuing an inmate,--an accident by which he\r\nwas dreadfully injured. When people look up at these fire-escapes, they\r\ngenerally shudder at the idea of having to enter the bag, suspended at a\r\nheight of forty feet from the ground; but in the hour of danger the\r\nterrified inmates never exhibit the slightest reluctance. Once in, they\r\nslide down the bulging canvas in the gentlest manner, without any of the\r\nrapidity that would be imagined from the almost perpendicular position in\r\nwhich it hangs.\r\n\r\nThe fire-escape which is stationed near the New Road is constructed so\r\nthat it can be taken off its wheels, in order to allow it to enter the\r\nlong gardens which here extend before so many of the houses. The height\r\nattainable by these escapes varies from 43-1/2 feet to 45 feet. A\r\nsupplemental short ladder is now carried by most of them, which can be\r\nquickly fitted on an emergency into the upper ladder, and increases the\r\nheight to 50 feet.\r\n\r\nThe intrepidity of the conductors of these machines is quite astonishing.\r\nFamiliarity with danger begets a coolness which enables them to place\r\nthemselves in positions which would prove destructive to unpractised\r\npersons. As in most cases they are the prominent actors in a drama\r\nwitnessed by a whole street-full of excited spectators, they are perhaps\r\ntempted by the cheers to risk themselves in a manner they would little\r\ndream of doing under other circumstances. In addition to such a stimulus\r\nthey are rewarded with a silver medal, and with sums of money, for any\r\nextraordinary act of gallantry. Every instance of a daring rescue is\r\nentered in the society's books, from which we have extracted a few\r\nexamples, to show what enterprising fellows they are. At a fire which\r\nbroke out in November, 1844, in a house in Hatton Garden, Conductor\r\nSunshine on his arrival found the following state of things. On the second\r\nfloor a man was sitting on the sill of one of the windows (there were four\r\nwindows abreast), and on the third floor a man was hanging by his hands to\r\nthe window-sill at the other extremity of the house-front. After having\r\nrescued the man on the second floor, he did not dare to raise his\r\nthird-floor ladder, for fear of hitting the hanging man's hands, and\r\ncausing him to fall; accordingly, he stood upon the top rung of the\r\nsecond-floor ladder, and by so doing could just touch with his upstrained\r\narms the poor fellow's depending feet. In this position, having himself\r\nbut a precarious hold of the window-frame beneath, his only footing being\r\nthe topmost rung, he called to the man to drop when he told him, and\r\ndiscovered from his silence that he was deaf and dumb. Upon being tapped\r\nupon the foot, however, he let go, and the conductor managed, incredible\r\nas it may appear, to slip him down between himself and the wall on to the\r\ntop of the ladder, and brought him safely to the ground. In the next case,\r\nConductor Chapman was the hero of the scene, although the indomitable\r\nSunshine was present. Having crossed the roofs of two adjoining\r\nout-buildings, Chapman managed to place his ladder against the second back\r\nfloor of the house on fire. Having rescued a lady, he was obliged to\r\nretrace his steps over the roofs, as the fire was coming through the\r\ntiling. He could only cross by making a bridge of the short ladder; and\r\nscarcely had they cleared the premises when it fell in with a tremendous\r\ncrash.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion this intrepid man having made an entrance into the\r\nsecond-floor window of a house in Tottenham-court Road, he was obliged to\r\nretreat twice, by reason of his lamp going out in the dense smoke. On the\r\nthird trial it remained in, and enabled him to search the place. \"I called\r\nout loud,\" he says in his report, \"and was answered by a kind of stifled\r\ncry. I rushed across the landing to the back room, and encountered a man,\r\nwho groaned out, \"O save my wife!\" I groped about, and laid hold of a\r\nfemale, who fell with me, clasping two children in her arms. I took them\r\nup, and brought them to the escape, guiding the man to follow me, and\r\nplaced them all safely in the canvas, from whence they reached the ground\r\nwithout any injury; and, finally, I came down myself, quite exhausted.\"\r\n\"We thought,\" said a bystander, \"when he jumped into the second-floor\r\nwindow, that we should not see him again alive; and I cannot tell you how\r\nhe was cheered when he appeared with the woman and her two children.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall content ourselves by quoting one more exploit from the Reports of\r\nthe Society, the hero of which was Conductor Wood, who received a\r\ntestimonial on vellum for the following service at a fire in\r\nColchester-street, Whitechapel, on the 29th of April, 1854:--\r\n\r\n    \"On his arrival, the fire was raging throughout the back of the house,\r\n    and smoke issuing from every window; upon entering the first-floor\r\n    room, part of which was on fire, he discovered five persons almost\r\n    insensible from the excessive heat: he immediately descended the\r\n    ladder _with a woman on his shoulders, and holding a child by its\r\n    night-clothes in his mouth_; again ascended, re-entered the room, and\r\n    having enabled the father to escape, had scarcely descended, _with a\r\n    child under each arm_, when the whole building became enveloped in\r\n    flames, rendering it impossible to attempt a rescue of the remainder\r\n    of the unfortunate inmates.\"\r\n\r\nThe rewards of the Society are not always won by their own men. William\r\nTrafford, police constable 344, for instance, had one of the Society's\r\nmedals presented to him, for \"allowing two persons to drop upon him from\r\nthe top windows of a house in College-street, Camden-town, and thereby\r\nenabling them to escape without material injury.\" Nothing is said as to\r\nthe damage done to poor Trafford by this act of self-devotion.\r\n\r\nThe real working value of the fire-escapes may be judged from the fact\r\nthat, during the twenty years they have been on duty, they have attended\r\nno less than 2,041 fires, and rescued 214 human beings from destruction.\r\nTo make this excellent scheme complete, only thirteen stations have now to\r\nbe established, at a first cost of about eighty pounds each; the\r\ncharitable could not give their money in a more worthy cause than in\r\nfurnishing these districts, in which many thousands of inhabitants are\r\nstill exposed to the most horrible of all deaths. To show that the\r\nusefulness of the Society has progressed with the number of their escapes,\r\nwe need only adduce the evidence of the table in the next page, made up to\r\nthe 25th of March of each year.\r\n\r\nThe fire-escapes, in addition to their own particular duty, are also of\r\nthe greatest service to the firemen of the Brigade, as, by the use of\r\ntheir ladders, they are enabled to ascend to any window of a house, and to\r\ndirect the jet directly upon the burning mass, instead of throwing it\r\nwild,--a matter of the greatest importance in extinguishing a fire: for\r\nunless you play upon the burning material, and thus cut off the flame at\r\nits root, you only uselessly deluge the building with water, which is, we\r\nbelieve, in many cases quite as destructive to stock and furniture as the\r\nfire it is intended to extinguish.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |_Year._|    _Number of_     |  _Fires_  |_Lives_ |\r\n  |       |    _Stations._     |_attended._|_saved._|\r\n  |-------|--------------------|-----------|--------|\r\n  |  1845 |  8 increased to 11 |    116    |   13   |\r\n  |  1846 | 11      \"       15 |     96    |    7   |\r\n  |  1847 | 15      \"       21 |    139    |   11   |\r\n  |  1848 | 21      \"       25 |    197    |   17   |\r\n  |  1849 | 25      \"       26 |    223    |   31   |\r\n  |  1850 | 26      \"       28 |    198    |   10   |\r\n  |  1851 | 28      \"       30 |    226    |   36   |\r\n  |  1852 | 30      \"       34 |    253    |   25   |\r\n  |  1853 | 34      \"       40 |    265    |   46   |\r\n  |  1854 | 40      \"       40 |    328    |   28   |\r\n  |       |  Two since added.  |           |        |\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nMuch may be done by the inmates to help themselves when a house is on\r\nfire, in case neither the engine nor the escape should arrive in time to\r\nassist them. Mr. Braidwood, in his little work on the method of proceeding\r\nat fires, advises his readers to rehearse to themselves his\r\nrecommendations, otherwise when the danger comes, they are thrown,\r\naccording to his experience, into \"a state of temporary derangement, and\r\nseem to be actuated only by a desire of muscular movement,\" throwing\r\nchairs and tables from the tops of houses that are scarcely on fire, and,\r\nto wind up the absurdity, he says, \"on one occasion I saw crockery-ware\r\nthrown from a window on the third floor.\"\r\n\r\nThe means to be adopted to prevent the flames spreading, resolve\r\nthemselves into taking care not to open doors or windows, which create a\r\ndraught. The same rule should be observed by those outside; no door or\r\nglass should be smashed in before the means are at hand to put out the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n    _Directions for aiding persons to escape from premises on fire._\r\n\r\n    1. Be careful to acquaint yourself with the best means of exit from\r\n    the house both at the top and bottom.\r\n\r\n    2. On the first alarm, reflect before you act. If in bed at the time,\r\n    wrap yourself in a blanket, or bedside carpet; open no more doors or\r\n    windows than are absolutely necessary, and shut every door after you.\r\n\r\n    3. There is always from eight to twelve inches of pure air close to\r\n    the ground: if you cannot therefore walk upright through the smoke,\r\n    drop on your hands and knees, and thus progress. A wetted silk\r\n    handkerchief, a piece of flannel, or a worsted stocking drawn over the\r\n    face, permits breathing, and, to a great extent, excludes the smoke.\r\n\r\n    4. If you can neither make your way upwards nor downwards, get into a\r\n    front room: if there is a family, see that they are all collected\r\n    here, and keep the door closed as much as possible, for remember that\r\n    smoke always follows a draught, and fire always rushes after smoke.\r\n\r\n    5. On no account throw yourself, or allow others to throw themselves,\r\n    from the window. If no assistance is at hand, and you are in\r\n    extremity, tie the sheets together, and, having fastened one end to\r\n    some heavy piece of furniture, let down the women and children one by\r\n    one, by tying the end of the line of sheets round the waist and\r\n    lowering them through the window that is over the door, rather than\r\n    through one that is over the area. You can easily let yourself down\r\n    when the helpless are saved.\r\n\r\n    6. If a woman's clothes should catch fire, let her instantly roll\r\n    herself over and over on the ground; if a man be present, let him\r\n    throw her down and do the like, and then wrap her in a rug, coat, or\r\n    the first _woollen_ thing that is at hand.\r\n\r\n    7. Bystanders, the instant they see a fire, should run for the\r\n    fire-escape, or to the police station if that is nearer, where a\r\n    \"jumping-sheet\" is always to be found.\r\n\r\nDancers, and those that are accustomed to wear light muslins and other\r\ninflammable articles of clothing, when they are likely to come in contact\r\nwith the gas, would do well to remember, that by steeping them in a\r\nsolution of alum they would not be liable to catch fire. If the rule were\r\nenforced at theatres, we might avoid any possible recurrence of such a\r\ncatastrophe as happened at Drury Lane in 1844, when poor Clara Webster was\r\nso burnt before the eyes of the audience, that she died in a few days.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-one years that the Brigade has been in existence the\r\nfiremen have been called out needlessly no less than 1,695 times, often\r\nindeed mischievously; for there are some idle people who think it amusing\r\nto send the men and engines miles away to imaginary fires. In most cases,\r\nhowever, these false alarms have originated in the over-anxiety of\r\npersons, who have hastened to the station for assistance, deceived by\r\nlights which they fancied to be of a suspicious character. Nature herself\r\nnow and then gives a false alarm, and puts the Brigade to infinite trouble\r\nby her vagaries. Not only the men at one station, but nearly half of the\r\nentire force, were employed in November, 1835, from 11 P.M. to 6 A.M. on\r\nthe succeeding morning, in running after the _aurora borealis_. Some of\r\nthe dozen engines out on that occasion reached as far as Kilburn and\r\nHampstead in search of those evanescent lights, which exactly simulated\r\nextensive fires. In the succeeding year the red rays of the rising sun\r\ntook in some credulous members of the Brigade, and led them with their\r\nengines full swing along the Commercial and Mile-End Roads. Whilst on this\r\nfalse scent they came upon a real fire, which, although inferior to great\r\nSol himself in grandeur, was far more remunerative, as the God of Morning\r\nknows nothing about rewards to first, second, and third engines.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and universal false alarm caused by the play of the\r\nnorthern lights was in the autumn of this same year, when the whole\r\nnorth-eastern horizon seemed possessed by an angry conflagration, from\r\nwhich huge clouds of smoke appeared to roll away. On this occasion the\r\npublic, as well as the firemen, were deceived: crowds poured forth from\r\nthe West-end on foot and in carriages to see what they imagined to be a\r\ngrand effect of the \"devouring element;\" and thirteen engines turned out\r\nwith the full impression that a whole suburb of the metropolis was in\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nThe alarms from chimneys on fire have called the engines out no less than\r\n1,982 times during the years the Brigade has been established, or on an\r\naverage twice a week. Let us hope that, as we are setting about clearing\r\nthe atmosphere by Act of Parliament, accidents of this kind will gradually\r\ncease. We may now watch with satisfaction many a tall shaft, as we steam\r\ndown the river, that seems to stand idle in the air; the great rolling\r\nclouds of smoke that used to obscure the sky on the southern bank of the\r\nThames are no longer seen, and the air is growing appreciably purer. It is\r\nevident that our manufacturers, where they have not become alive to the\r\nsaving it would effect, have been coerced by the vigorous manner in which\r\nthe Home Secretary has put the law in force against these black offenders;\r\nand we may hope that Dr. Arnott's smoke-consuming grate, or some\r\nmodification of it, will ere long find its way into every house to\r\ncomplete the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLICE AND THE THIEVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost men who have arrived at that age when the last one or two buttons of\r\nthe waistcoat are allowed to be unloosened after dinner, can remember the\r\ntime when the safety of life and property in the metropolis depended on\r\nthe efforts of the parochial watchman, a species of animal after the model\r\nof the old hackney coachman, encumbered with the self same drab greatcoat,\r\nwith countless capes, with the self same Belcher handkerchief, or\r\ncomforter, speaking in the same husky voice, and just as sottish, stupid,\r\nand uncivil. At night--for it was not thought worth while to set a watch\r\nin the day-time--the authorities provided him with a watch-box in order\r\nthat he might enjoy his snooze in comfort, and furnished him with a huge\r\nlantern in order that its rays might enable the thief to get out of his\r\nway in time. As if these aids to escape were not sufficient for the\r\nmidnight marauder, the watchman was provided with a staff with which he\r\nthundered on the pavement as he walked, a noise which he alternated with\r\ncrying the hour and the state of the weather in a loud singing voice, and\r\nwhich told of his whereabouts when he himself was far out of sight.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1828, and indeed for ten years later, in the city these men\r\nwere the sole defence by night of the first metropolis in the world. The\r\nCharlies, as they were familiarly termed, had very little fight in them at\r\nany time; but it is well known that they \"winked hard,\" when required to\r\ndo so by people who could afford to pay them for it. It is not astonishing\r\nthat crimes under such a police flourished apace, or that robberies\r\nincreased to an extent which alarmed all thoughtful people. Mr.\r\nColquhoun, a magistrate, whose work on the police, written at the\r\nbeginning of the century, gave the first ideas of the reforms which have\r\nbeen since adopted; estimates that the annual value of the property stolen\r\nat the time at which he wrote, was at least 1,500,000_l._; and that the\r\nevil was gaining ground may be judged from the fact that the number of\r\nreceivers of stolen goods had increased, between 1780 and 1800, from 300\r\nto 3,000!\r\n\r\nIn addition to the nightly watch there was another class of persons who,\r\nif more active, were calculated in a still greater degree to defeat\r\njustice, but in a totally opposite direction: we allude to those men who\r\nmade their bread out of the blood of the criminal population. The\r\nGovernment of the country was mainly to blame for the sins committed by\r\nthese loathsome creatures. Since the time of Jonathan Wild thief-catchers\r\nhad been stimulated to make criminals by what was termed Parliamentary\r\nrewards, or sums of forty pounds given by the Home Office to persons\r\naffording such information as would lead to the conviction of felons. The\r\nobject of the officers was to secure blood-money, not to suppress crime;\r\nand it was their deliberate practice to allow robberies to proceed, which\r\nthey might have prevented, in order to obtain the reward. To use their own\r\nlanguage, they were accustomed \"to let the matter ripen\" until the fee was\r\nsecure, and the work was cut out for the hangman. These men must not be\r\nconfounded with the Bow Street runners, or detective police, some of whom\r\nwere able and perhaps honest men; but they chiefly occupied themselves\r\nwith thief-catching in private preserves, where the pay was ample, and\r\ncontributed little if anything to the suppression of general crime.\r\n\r\nWith a class of watchmen totally inoperative as a preventive police, with\r\na class of informers stimulated by unwise enactments to lure men into\r\nvillany, and with a code savage almost beyond belief--as late as 1800\r\nthere were 160 capital crimes, and to break the dam of a fish-pond, or to\r\ncut down an apple-tree in a garden, were offences punishable with death;\r\nit is not to be wondered at that \"the deadly never-green,\" as the gallows\r\nwas called in the slang language of the day, bore fruit all the year\r\nround. Old Townsend, the Bow Street officer, who gave evidence before the\r\ncommittee which sat in 1816 to inquire into the police of the metropolis,\r\nsaid, \"I remember in 1783, when Serjeant Adair was recorder, there were\r\nforty hung at two executions; the unfortunate people themselves laugh at\r\nit now, they call it a bagatelle.\" Among the more serious offences were\r\nthe robberies committed by mounted highwaymen; and, in order to give an\r\nidea of their frequency, we again quote the racy evidence of\r\nTownsend:--\"Formerly there were two, three, or four highwaymen--some on\r\nHounslow Heath, some on Wimbledon Common, some on Finchley Common, some on\r\nthe Romford Road. I have actually come to Bow Street in the morning, and\r\nwhile I have been leaning over the desk had three or four people come in\r\nand say, 'I was robbed by two highwaymen in such a place;' 'I was robbed\r\nby a single highwayman in such a place.' People travel safe now by means\r\nof the horse-patrol, which was planned by Sir Richard Ford.\" This\r\nhorse-patrol, established in 1805, was the first innovation on the old\r\nsystem of watching; and it succeeded so admirably, that in a few years the\r\nhighwaymen were entirely banished from the metropolitan counties, and the\r\ngreat roads in the neighbourhood of London, which were once as unsafe as\r\nthose in the vicinity of Rome, became as orderly as Fleet Street. It does\r\nindeed seem strange that while the outskirts of the metropolis were thus\r\nprovided with a new force which proved itself to be perfectly capable of\r\nclearing away the ruffians, no means should have been taken until 1829 to\r\nsupersede the old parish constables who had flourished from the time of\r\nthe Saxons, and appear to have been in full bloom in Elizabeth's reign,\r\nsince Dogberry is a finished portrait of the race. No means existed by\r\nwhich the watchmen of different parishes could be made to co-operate\r\nagainst their common enemy, the thief. In the city they were under the\r\ndirection of no less than thirty different authorities. There were the\r\nstreet-keepers, the patrol, the ward-constables, &c., all acting under\r\nseparate masters; and so complete was the division that the constable of\r\none ward would not interfere to prevent a robbery going on on the opposite\r\nside of the street, if it was out of his bounds.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Elliot, in his evidence, given in 1838, before the Committee on\r\n\"The Metropolis Police Offices,\" mentions a glaring instance of the\r\nperfect paralysis of the executive which arose out of this absurd system.\r\n\"Two years ago,\" he said, \"a neighbour of mine had his warehouse broken\r\nopen, and a hundred pounds' worth of tea was taken away; a watchman at the\r\ntop of the street saw a cart going away from the warehouse; but he said it\r\nwas not in his ward, and therefore he did not interfere.\" The public\r\nindisposition to get rid of the old watchmen most certainly did not arise\r\nfrom any ignorance of their inefficiency; they had long, in fact, been\r\nbywords of feebleness and imbecility. To thrash a Charlie was a pet\r\npastime of the young bloods of that day. The determined propensity to doze\r\nof these worthy functionaries was a standing topic for witticism. \"A\r\nfriend of mine,\" said Erskine, \"was suffering from a continual\r\nwakefulness, and various methods were taken to send him to sleep, but in\r\nvain. At last his physicians resorted to an experiment which succeeded\r\nperfectly. They dressed him in a watchman's coat, put a lantern in his\r\nhand, and placed him in a sentry-box, and he was asleep in ten minutes.\"\r\nIt might be imagined that tokens like these indicated pretty clearly that\r\na reform would have been hailed with delight. The result proved, however,\r\nthat to abuse a thing and to amend it are widely different. Mr. Peel, who\r\nhad been feeling his way to his grand experiment by the establishment of a\r\nBow-street day patrol, obtained in 1828 the appointment of a committee of\r\nthe House of Commons to inquire into the expediency of establishing a\r\nuniform system of police in the metropolis; and the committee having\r\nreported to the House in favour of the scheme, it was immediately adopted.\r\nThis salutary change was not made without creating a deep sensation. That\r\nstalking-horse, \"the liberty of the subject,\" which in truth meant the\r\nliberty of rogues to plunder, was immediately paraded before the public;\r\nand we have no doubt whatever that in the tavern debating-clubs of the day\r\nit was reported that with the fall of the Charlies \"the sun of England's\r\nglory had set for ever.\" And indeed to Englishmen, jealous of their\r\npersonal liberty, the establishment of this new force might at first have\r\ncreated some well-founded alarm. It was no longer a question of a few\r\nconstables, but of a standing army of nearly six thousand men, drilled\r\nlike soldiers, taught to act in masses, and entirely independent of the\r\ncontrol of the ratepayers. The very fact of the appointment, as one of the\r\nCommissioners, of Colonel Rowan, who had been employed in that\r\nquasi-military force the Irish constabulary, favoured the idea that the\r\nnew police were to be a veritable _gendarmerie_. That such was the popular\r\nidea was clearly indicated by the numerous prints which appeared at the\r\ntime of a fierce-looking \"Peeler,\" armed with a belt full of pistols and a\r\nformidable sword.\r\n\r\nThose accustomed only to the slow pace of the constitutional watchman, as\r\nhe waddled out to his post, beholding with astonishment the sergeant's\r\nparty as it marched along the kerb in close file, and keeping quick\r\nmilitary step, believed that so powerful a force, concentrated under a\r\nsingle head, might be turned to political purposes. The constables never\r\nappeared in the streets without being followed by crowds hooting at them,\r\nand calling them by the obnoxious names of \"Peelers,\" \"Raw Lobsters,\"\r\n\"Crushers,\" \"Bobbies,\" &c. At last, in 1833, an actual collision took\r\nplace between them and the great unwashed in Coldbath Fields. A meeting of\r\nChartists was appointed to be held there, from which serious consequences\r\nwere expected to arise. Directions were given to disperse it; but whilst\r\nin the performance of their duty three of the police were stabbed, and one\r\nof them mortally. It might have been thought that the very fact of a mob\r\ncoming thus armed, with the express purpose of resisting a constituted\r\nauthority, would have excited the indignation of the more respectable\r\nclasses of the citizens. The contrary was the effect. A coroner's jury\r\nbrought in a verdict of justifiable homicide--a pretty significant sign of\r\nthe feeling towards the new force of the class from which the jury was\r\nselected. Such was the ferment that a commission was held to inquire into\r\nthe conduct of the police, and they were exonerated from the charge of\r\nhaving, as a body, acted with greater violence than was necessary. From\r\nthat period, with the exception of the investigation during the Beer Bill\r\ncommotion into the charge of having dispersed a gathering in Hyde Park\r\nwith undue severity--a charge which was not at all substantiated--their\r\nconduct has been so exemplary as completely to have removed the original\r\ndislike. Experience has served to teach the men the virtue of moderation\r\nand patience; and they are now looked upon as a constitutional force,\r\nsimply because we have got accustomed to them.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Metropolitan Police Force consists of--a Chief\r\nCommissioner, Sir Richard Mayne; 2 Assistant-Commissioners, Captain\r\nLabalmondiere and Captain Harris; 18 Superintendents, 133 Inspectors, 625\r\nSergeants, and 4,954 Constables; making a total of all ranks of 5,734. The\r\nmachinery by which this comparatively small force is enabled to watch by\r\nnight and day every alley, street, and square of this vast metropolis,\r\nnay, tries every accessible door and window of its 400,000 houses, patrols\r\n90 square miles of country, exercises a surveillance over the 8,000\r\nreputed thieves who prey upon its inhabitants, and keeps in awe the 40,000\r\nor 50,000 people who form \"the uneasy classes\" of the metropolis, is not\r\nvery complicated. The metropolitan police district extends from Charing\r\nCross 15 miles in every direction, and includes the whole of Middlesex and\r\nlarge portions of Surrey, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Buckinghamshire, and\r\nBerkshire, for which seven counties the Commissioners are magistrates and\r\nthe police are sworn constables. The river Thames is also under its\r\njurisdiction from Chelsea to Barking Creek, including all its wharves,\r\ndocks, landing-places, and dockyards. The entire district has a\r\ncircumference of 90 miles, and extends over an area of 700 square miles,\r\n100 of which, forming what is called the interior area, is covered with\r\nour great Babel of brick and mortar. This wide extent of ground is mapped\r\nout into 18 divisions, each of which is watched by a detachment of men,\r\nvarying in number according to the extent of the area, the exposed nature\r\nof the property, or the density of the population:--\r\n\r\n  _Letters of_      _Local Names of_  _Strength of each_\r\n  _Divisions._        _Divisions._       _Division._\r\n\r\n      A              Whitehall              380\r\n      B              Westminster            324\r\n      C              St. James's            265\r\n      D              St. Mary-le-bone       371\r\n      E              Holborn                175\r\n      F              Covent Garden          165\r\n      G              Finsbury               317\r\n      H              Whitechapel            233\r\n      K              Stepney                482\r\n      L              Lambeth                208\r\n      M              Southwark              350\r\n      N              Islington              513\r\n      P              Camberwell             408\r\n      R              Greenwich              454\r\n      S              Hampstead              410\r\n      T              Kensington             288\r\n      V              Wandsworth             381\r\n      Thames Police                         103\r\n\r\nThis it will be seen that policeman X, who figures so often in the pages\r\nof \"Punch,\" is a myth of our facetious contemporary.\r\n\r\nEach division is separated into subdivisions, the subdivisions into\r\nsections, and, last of all the sections into beats. Of the main divisions,\r\nA, although one of the smallest in area, is by far the most important; it\r\nis the seat of the central authority located at Scotland Yard. Its police\r\nare much finer men (taller on the average than the Guards), and their\r\nduties are more responsible than those of any other division. They attend\r\nupon the Sovereign, the Parliament, the theatres, the parks, and all other\r\nplaces of public resort, such as Epsom and Ascot races, the flower shows,\r\nCrystal Palace, &c. The A division is, in fact, to the general body of\r\nMetropolitan Police what the Guards are to the army. To enable it to\r\nperform these extra duties, it has a reserve force of 250 men, drafted off\r\non ordinary occasions in companies of fifty each to the B, C, D, G, and M\r\ndivisions; upon this reserve force it draws when necessary.\r\n\r\nThe other divisions are pretty much alike in the nature of their duties,\r\nwhich are simply those of watching. Certain modifications, however, arise\r\nfrom the character of their districts; thus a constable on duty at\r\nWhitechapel, if suddenly removed to Westminster or Mary-le-bone, would\r\nfind himself considerably at fault, inasmuch as a familiarity with fights\r\nin courts, disputes with tramps, and the coarse language of low\r\nlodging-houses, is not a good school for the amenities required among a\r\nmore fashionable population. In all the divisions exactly the same\r\norganization is maintained, and the same amount of arduous work is\r\nperformed. Two-thirds of the entire force is on duty from nine or ten in\r\nthe evening till five or six in the morning. Not long since the\r\nnight-police were condemned to patrol the streets for nine hours, without\r\nsitting down, or even leaning their weary limbs against any support. This\r\nsevere labour was found incompatible with the maintenance of due vigilance\r\ntowards the end of the watch; the men are, therefore, now kept on duty\r\nonly eight hours. Day work is divided into reliefs, and extends from six\r\na.m. to nine p.m. Notwithstanding its greater severity, there are men who\r\nprefer the stolid unimpeded walk in the night, in which they go through\r\ntheir work like machines, to the more bustling and exciting day-patrol.\r\nThe sergeants or inspectors make the round of the districts to see that\r\nthe constables are duly parading their beats.\r\n\r\nIf a door or window is discovered in an unsafe condition, its insecurity\r\nis immediately made known to the inmates; and if the constable fails to\r\ndetect the circumstance during his tour, and it is afterwards observed by\r\nhis sergeant or the succeeding constable, he is reported, and fined for\r\nhis neglect. Continued inattention is visited by dismissal. Offences of\r\nevery kind are severely punished, as appears from the fact that, between\r\nthe years 1850 and 1856, 1,276 policemen were turned out of the force. Of\r\nthese, sixty-eight were criminally convicted. Thus the men are kept up to\r\ntheir work, and collusions with thieves are rendered exceedingly\r\ndifficult. Every morning a sheet of \"Occurrences\" is forwarded to the\r\nChief Commissioner at Scotland Yard, which contains the full particulars\r\nof all matters worthy of notice which have taken place during the night\r\nthroughout the metropolis, and a record of all property lost or stolen,\r\nfrom a gold pin to a chest of plate, is kept at the same central\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nIn case any affair of unusual importance occurs, a murder or a great\r\nrobbery, the intelligence is conveyed by the constable who first becomes\r\ncognizant of it, to the central station of his division; from this point\r\nthe news is radiated by policemen carrying what are termed route-papers,\r\nor papers of particulars of the offence, on the backs of which are marked\r\nthe hour at which they were received at the different divisions through\r\nwhich they passed. In this manner information can be circulated in two\r\nhours to all the stations, excepting those belonging to the exterior or\r\nsuburban districts. In these reports are given the names of the constables\r\nwho were on the beats in which the offence took place, the sergeants in\r\ncharge of the sections, and the names of the constables whose particular\r\nbusiness it was to trace the offenders as far as possible. We understand,\r\nhowever, that the electric telegraph is now shooting its nerve-like\r\nthreads to all the divisional stations in the metropolis, and, when the\r\nnew agent is brought to bear, the communication will be almost\r\ninstantaneous. Thus, in case of robbery, every constable will be made\r\nacquainted with the particulars without a moment's delay, and the\r\npolice-net will be thrown at one cast over the entire metropolis. Thieves\r\nwill no longer be able to get away with their plunder, ere a hue and cry\r\nhas been raised after the property. Had the telegraph been in existence,\r\nin all probability Her Majesty's plate-chest would have been intercepted\r\nbefore it reached the field where it was ransacked in Shoreditch. In cases\r\nof riot of a formidable nature, the telegraph will be able to concentrate\r\n5,000 men in a couple of hours upon any spot within five miles of Charing\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nTowards the outskirts of the metropolis, in the exterior or suburban\r\ndistricts, the widely-scattered constables chiefly perform the duties of a\r\nrural police. The great distances they have to traverse necessitates the\r\nuse of horses; here, accordingly, we find the mounted police, the\r\nsuccessors of the old horse-patrol established in 1805. The strength of\r\nthis force, men and officers included, is only 120; they are furnished\r\nwith powerful nags, and are armed with swords and pistols. Indeed the\r\nfoot-police, whose beats lie in unfrequented rural districts, are allowed\r\nside-arms--a precaution which the fate of the policeman, who was brutally\r\nmurdered in a field at Dagenham, in Essex, some years since, proved to be\r\nby no means unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the metropolitan police district is the City police,\r\nunder the management of the corporation. The area of this peculiar, to\r\nborrow an ecclesiastical term, is only one square mile and a quarter; but\r\nforming as it does the very centre of business, it is by far the richest\r\npart of London, for, while it contains only one-twentieth portion of its\r\ninhabitants, it possesses a fourteenth part of its wealth. This small\r\nspace is, in fact, the great heart not only of the metropolis, but of the\r\ncommercial world. Through its principal thoroughfares a vaster flood of\r\ntraffic is poured for several hours than is to be found in any other\r\nstreets in the world. In the year 1850 it was ascertained that no less\r\nthan 67,510 foot-passengers, and 13,796 vehicles, containing no fewer than\r\n52,092 persons, passed Bow Church, Cheapside, in one day. By another\r\nchannel of communication, Aldgate, near the Minories, 58,430\r\nfoot-passengers, and 9,332 vehicles, containing 20,804 persons, passed in\r\nthe same time; and it is estimated that altogether no less than 400,000\r\npersons are poured into this one square mile and a quarter in the course\r\nof the twelve hours. The congregation in so confined a space of so vast a\r\nnumber of people, many of whom are forced to carry about with them\r\nconsiderable sums of money, must prove a great source of attraction to\r\nthieves of all kinds, and demands the constant vigilance of a\r\ncomparatively large body of police. It was not until ten years after the\r\nsuccessful experiment of the metropolitan police, however, that the\r\ncorporation of London, wedded to its old system of ward-beadles,\r\nstreet-keepers, and imbecile constables, could be brought to adopt the new\r\nsystem; but it must be admitted that the present force, consisting of 1\r\nsuperintendent, 13 inspectors, 12 station-sergeants, 47 sergeants, and 492\r\npolicemen, making a total of 565, do the duty well; and the City, with all\r\nits stored wealth, is now as safe as the rest of the metropolis. At all\r\nthe banks plain-clothes men are constantly in attendance to keep out the\r\nswell-mob, who buzz about such places as wasps do about a peach wall; and\r\nin the great thoroughfares, such as Cheapside, six or seven policemen are\r\nalways to be found.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the City, which produce its characteristic robberies,\r\nare the number of its uninhabited warehouses, the perfect labyrinth of\r\nlanes which traverse and intersect its streets in all directions, and the\r\nvast number of carts and vans always standing full of valuable goods at\r\nthe warehouse doors. The greatest precautions are taken to mark the\r\nfastenings on the warehouse doors, so as to betray any attempt to force\r\nthem; and these devices are generally successful. The reticulation of\r\nlanes will always prove a trouble to the police and a security to\r\npickpockets. Not many years ago a bank clerk was attacked at mid-day in\r\none of these passages in the very heart of the City, but luckily he\r\nretained hold of his case, which held most valuable property, and it is\r\nnow the custom to chain these bill-cases to the person, just as they used\r\nto chain books in the olden time to the library shelves. It is also\r\ncustomary for bank clerks to tear the corners off all Bank of England\r\nnotes, so as to render them unnegotiable, unless to persons who can\r\nproduce the corresponding piece,--a contrivance which, no doubt, put a\r\nstop to audacious attacks upon these money-carriers in the middle of the\r\nday. The most common robberies are those from vehicles loading and\r\ndischarging valuable silk and other goods at the warehouse doors. For the\r\nprotection of such goods a small dog is the best policeman; and carts are\r\nrarely seen in the City without one of these nimble guardians. The old\r\nrestriction which prevented the metropolitan police from entering the\r\nCity, and the City force from entering the metropolitan districts, is now\r\nabandoned. Nevertheless, the fact of their being under a distinct\r\njurisdiction prevents that unity of action which ought to prevail. Not\r\nlong since, a City policeman patrolling one of the streets which extended\r\ninto the metropolitan department, was informed by a passer-by that they\r\nwere killing a constable at the top of the street, to which the policeman\r\nreplied that it was out of his beat and he could not interfere! When next\r\nthe Sibyl presents her leaves to the city corporation, in all probability\r\nthe present isolated system of police will not be found inscribed on any\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nScotland Yard, as we have said, is the brain or central ganglion which\r\ndirects the system of metropolitan police. Here the commissioners sit\r\ndaily, and are ready to receive the complaints or other communications of\r\nthe public. Its rooms are full of clerks, but all in the uniform of the\r\npolice; in one office may be seen the constables wielding the pen instead\r\nof the truncheon, preparing daily returns and reports; in another, reading\r\nthe morning and country papers, to learn what is doing that may require\r\ntheir presence, and to know what thieves have turned up in the police\r\ncourts; in a third room an inspector is reading to the clerks from the\r\ndifferent divisions any particulars it may be advisable to communicate to\r\nthe entire force; in a fourth we see the secret chamber of the detective\r\npolice--those human moles who work without casting up the earth lest their\r\ncourse should be discovered. In an office apart from the rest are the\r\nforeign detectives, who watch over _mauvais sujets_ from abroad. The\r\nentire floating foreign population in the metropolis is well known to the\r\npolice, and no plots against allied governments could well be hatched in\r\nLondon without their cognizance. All articles lost in public conveyances\r\nare here taken charge of. The \"Lost Property Office\" contains piles of\r\numbrellas, parasols, and walking-sticks, together with a curious\r\nassemblage of articles of jewellery and wearing apparel, brought by honest\r\ncabmen. On one occasion a parcel with cash to the amount of 1,600_l._ was\r\ndeposited; and on another a thousand-pound note. Valuable property is\r\nalways claimed immediately; but sticks, parasols, and umbrellas accumulate\r\nin a manner which proves that their loss is due to the carelessness of\r\ntheir owners and not to the loose morality of others. The offices for the\r\ninspectors of dangerous structures and for licensing common lodging-houses\r\nand the drivers and conductors of public conveyances, all of which\r\ndepartments are managed by the police, are close at hand.\r\n\r\nIn the drilling-ground of the force--an open space surrounded by a\r\nhoarding close to the State Paper Office--there are generally from thirty\r\nto forty men in course of training, to fill up the gaps caused by\r\ndismissals, resignations, &c. On the occasion of our visit the yard was\r\noccupied by two bodies--the raw material, in the shape of some twenty\r\nindividuals dressed in every variety of costume; and another batch of the\r\nfinished article, buttoned up in blue and resplendent with plated buttons.\r\nThe eye had only to run along the \"gammut of men,\" if we may so term the\r\nfresh recruits drawn up before us, in order to see from how many ranks of\r\nsociety the police brigade is reinforced; smock-frocks, shooting-coats,\r\nfrock-coats, tail-coats, some seedy and worn, some still good and fresh,\r\ndenoted the condition in life of their owners, and the necessities to\r\nwhich some of them were reduced. Young men flushed with hope come from the\r\nprovinces to push their fortunes, after a brief struggle find themselves\r\nstranded, and accept this, the most readily-obtained respectable service.\r\n\r\nAs every policeman must be able to read and write, have a good character,\r\nand be of sound body and mind, the mere overflowings of the labour-market\r\nare excluded from the force; moreover, persons can always leave the\r\nservice by giving a month's notice. For these reasons a much more\r\nintelligent class of men recruit the police than the army, and it is\r\nsingular to note how this intelligence tells. The drill of constables and\r\nsoldiers is nearly alike, yet the former learn all their movements in a\r\nfortnight, whilst the latter require at least two months. Intelligence of\r\na certain kind, however, may be carried too far; your sharp Londoner makes\r\na very bad policeman; he is too volatile and conceited to submit himself\r\nto discipline, and is oftener rejected than the persons from other parts,\r\nwith whom eight-tenths of the force are recruited. The best constables\r\ncome from the provincial cities and towns. They are both quicker and more\r\n\"plucky\" than the mere countryman fresh from the village--a singular fact,\r\nwhich proves that manly vigour, both physical and mental, is to be found\r\nin populations neither too aggregated nor entirely isolated.\r\n\r\nThe policemen, perfect in their material drill, next undergo a mental one.\r\nDrawn up in line, a sergeant or inspector questions them as to their\r\nduties. \"Supposing you see two men fighting, what would you do?\" or, \"If\r\nyou were to discover a house on fire, how would you act?\" Sometimes the\r\nconstable addressed answers the question, but more generally his\r\ninterrogator does it for him. When drilled and catechized to the full\r\npitch, he doffs his plain clothes for a uniform, and comes out in the full\r\nbloom of a policeman. But he is still a neophyte, and before he is\r\nintrusted with a beat he attends at a police-court in order to watch the\r\nmanner in which trained constables comport themselves in the witness-box.\r\nHaving learned to give evidence clearly and briefly, to listen to\r\nludicrous scenes without smiling, and to bear bad language with\r\nimperturbable patience, he is marched off to the division in which he has\r\nelected to serve (the policeman is always if possible allowed this\r\nprivilege), and with his armlet on his wrist, his staff in one pocket, and\r\nhis rattle in the other, he patrols his beat.\r\n\r\nTwo especial injunctions are given to him--never to show his staff except\r\nto protect himself, and never to spring his rattle at night except in a\r\ncase of great urgency. The care taken to hide his offensive weapon is one\r\nof the best points of our police arrangements. The officers sent over here\r\nto gain information, prior to the introduction of the English police\r\nsystem in Paris, were astonished at this forbearance: the Frenchmen could\r\nnot understand why a man should carry a deadly weapon, unless to make a\r\ndemonstration with it! In this little incident we see the essential\r\ndifference between the French and English character. In six months' time\r\nit is expected that the young hand will prove a steady officer; that a\r\nwild young fellow, who perhaps only a few months before knew no restraint,\r\nshould become a machine, moving, thinking, and speaking only as his\r\ninstruction-book directs; and so wonderful are the powers of organization\r\nthat such an officer he generally becomes. We all know him, for we see him\r\nday by day as we promenade the streets. Stiff, calm, and inexorable, he\r\nseems to take no interest in any mortal thing; to have neither hopes nor\r\nfears. Amid the bustle of Piccadilly or the roar of Oxford Street, P. C. X\r\n59 stalks along, an _institution_ rather than a man. We seem to have no\r\nmore hold of his personality than we could possibly get of his coat,\r\nbuttoned up to the throttling-point. Go, however, to the section-house, an\r\nestablishment generally attached to the chief station of each division, in\r\nwhich the unmarried policemen are lodged, and enter the common hall or\r\nreading-room, and you no longer see policemen, but men; they have cast off\r\ntheir tight coats, as certain other unboiled lobsters, at fixed intervals,\r\ncast off their shells. They are absolutely laughing with each other! Some\r\nare writing, some are reading the morning papers, a group are grinning at\r\nthe caricature of P. C. X 202 in \"Punch;\" some are deep in the horrors of\r\na romance, extended at full length along a bench, with their trowsers\r\ntucked up; all are at their ease, taking rational amusement. In the common\r\nroom of every section-house there is a library.[47] That in King Street,\r\nWestminster, contains 1,200 volumes, a well-selected medley of subjects,\r\ngrave and gay. Some of the volumes, indeed, surprised us, as they seemed\r\nto indicate an erudite taste which we did not give police constables\r\ncredit for possessing. We give a few of their titles as they came under\r\nour notice:--\r\n\r\n    Taylor's Holy Living.\r\n\r\n    The Annals of the English Bible.\r\n\r\n    Macaulay's Essays.\r\n\r\n    Alison's Europe.\r\n\r\n    Paley's Works.\r\n\r\n    Byron's Works.\r\n\r\n    The Waverley Novels.\r\n\r\n    James's Naval History.\r\n\r\n    Lane's Modern Egyptians.\r\n\r\n    Life of Mohammud, by Mohun Lal.\r\n\r\n    Tom Cringle's Log.\r\n\r\n    Bishop Heber's Journal.\r\n\r\n    Washington Irving's Works.\r\n\r\n    Colonial and Home Library.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the list, good reader? Policemen reading Paley! Can\r\nwe wonder that they are so very blue? But we must not misrepresent the\r\nforce. If volumes such as these are thumbed sufficiently to show that some\r\nScotch sergeant has a taste for theological reading and \"fee-lo-so-phy,\"\r\nthe prevalent inquiry is after good English literature; and, although the\r\n\"Wandering Jew\" and the \"Mysteries of Paris\" are in the library, we are\r\ntold that the men do not like, and apparently do not understand, French\r\nromances. The library is only open on Thursdays, and then but for two\r\nhours. For this there is a philosophical reason. \"What we can always see,\"\r\nsaid the superintendent who kindly showed us over the Section, \"we never\r\nsee: it is only strangers that know all the sights of the metropolis.\" On\r\nthe same principle, the issue of books is limited in the manner we have\r\nstated, and we are told that the plan answers admirably. The dormitories\r\nat King-street accommodate about ninety persons, the great portion of\r\nwhom, having done night-duty, we saw fast asleep, on a fine tempting\r\nafternoon. It takes full three months for the men to acquire the habit of\r\nsleeping in the day; but, once acquired, they never lose it afterwards,\r\nalthough they return at stated intervals to day-duty again. They find\r\ntheir own breakfasts and suppers, but they mess together at dinner. They\r\ntake it in turns to cater for the week; and the emulation thus created\r\nproves to the advantage of the mess, as we hear that early peas, and other\r\ndelicacies of the season, find their way to the policemen's table.[48] It\r\nwould be an immense boon to the Benedicts of the force if accommodation\r\ncould also be found for them in the section-houses. In these days of model\r\nlodging-houses such an injustice to family men should scarcely be allowed\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest reasons which weighed with Mr. Peel in proposing the\r\nestablishment of the new police in 1829 was the expediency of instituting\r\na force powerful enough to cope with mobs, and to repress those incipient\r\ncommotions which, if too roughly dealt with by the military, are apt to\r\nleave an abiding sense of irritation in the public mind. The massacre of\r\n\"Peterloo,\" as it was vulgarly called, without doubt proved to the\r\nreflective mind of Peel that civil disturbances could no longer be dealt\r\nwith by the sharp edge of the sword, and that a knock-down blow of a\r\ntruncheon was far more congenial to the English skull than the sabre of\r\nthe yeoman or the bullet of the \"sodger.\" That view was undoubtedly\r\ncorrect. The new police have not, it is true, come in contact with excited\r\nmobs on more than three occasions,--the affair of Coldbath Fields, in the\r\nyear 1833, the Chartist gathering in 1848, and the skirmish in the Park,\r\nof July, 1855. On each of these occasions the crowd was immediately\r\ndispersed, and whatever irritation might have existed at the time, it\r\nquickly died away. There seems to be no fear that a London mob will ever\r\nprove a serious thing in the face of our present corps of policemen. A\r\nrepetition of the Lord George Gordon riots would be an impossibility.\r\nThose who shudder at the idea of an outbreak in the metropolis, containing\r\ntwo millions and a half of people and at least fifty thousand of the\r\n\"dangerous classes,\" forget that the capital is so wide that its different\r\nsections are totally unknown to each other. A mob in London is wholly\r\nwithout cohesion, and the individuals composing it have but few feelings,\r\nthoughts, or pursuits in common. They would immediately break up before\r\nthe determined attack of a band of well-trained men who know and have\r\nconfidence in each other. The genuine Londoner, moreover, is no fighter;\r\nhe will \"slang\" and \"chaff\" wittily with his tongue, but he will not come\r\nto blows. Those who have any experience in the _gamins_ of the great towns\r\nin England must have observed the vast difference between the want of\r\npugnacity in the cockney-bred boy, and the love of fisticuffs among the\r\nyouths of Bristol, Birmingham, or Manchester, which are the nurseries of\r\nprize-fighters. The great town has sharpened the brain of the Londoner,\r\nbut unstrung his sinews and cowed his courage, and he is a pigmy in the\r\nhands of the vigorous provincials. The middle classes are an exception,\r\nand we doubt not that the same spirit which marched with the trained-bands\r\nfrom London to Gloucester, in the civil war, is still to be found among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the only quarter in which any formidable riot could take\r\nplace would be eastward, in the neighbourhood of the Docks, where there\r\nare at least twelve thousand sailors in the river or on shore, ready for a\r\nspree, fearless and powerful, and acting with an undoubted _esprit de\r\ncorps_. These, if associated with the seven or eight thousand\r\ndock-labourers and lightermen, would certainly produce a force difficult\r\nto cope with. For such emergencies the police are provided with side-arms,\r\nbut we fear they are not well trained to their use, and it would take at\r\nleast fourteen days to perfect them. If in any civil disturbance, however,\r\nit should come to cold steel, we think that the soldiers would prove far\r\nmore effective, and their interference would be less galling than that of\r\nthe police armed with murderous weapons. Prevention is the true duty of\r\nthe civil force. One of the simplest methods for breaking up a crowd, in\r\norder that it may have no unity of action, is to march sections of\r\nconstables, in double files of say fifty each; these sections moving a few\r\nyards apart speedily cleave by their weight the densest mob in twain. When\r\nonce this division is made, the order is given to face right and left and\r\nmarch; by this means the mass is riven into a dozen helpless portions. If\r\nthe mounted police can be brought into action, it is customary to march\r\nthem in every direction through the crowd. Those who were in Hyde Park on\r\nthe evening of the great Sunday gathering in July 1855, witnessed how\r\neffectually this singular manoeuvre was executed under the orders of\r\nCaptain Labalmondiere. The horsemen, circulating among the immense crowd,\r\nentirely disintegrated the mass, and rendered it helpless for a common\r\nmovement, and this without any altercation; for what use could there be in\r\narguing with horses' heels? A policeman's staff thrust in your chest,\r\naccompanied by a peremptory order to stand back, would probably \"rile\" the\r\nbest of us; but what is to be said against the push of a horse's flank or\r\nthe descent of a heavy hoof? Everybody is glad to get as quickly as\r\npossible out of the way, and thus the whole company break as it were of\r\ntheir own accord.\r\n\r\nLet us now revert to the Detective Police. When the Metropolitan force was\r\nestablished in 1829, the old Bow-street officers, not caring to work with\r\nthe new system, retired from public life, and set up a private practice\r\nin hunting out offenders, in which occupation some of them continue to\r\nthis day. For fifteen years there was no establishment of detectives\r\nconnected with the police; but the inconvenience of not possessing so\r\nnecessary a wheel in the constabulary machinery induced Sir James Graham,\r\nwho had, perhaps, a leaning towards this branch of the profession, to\r\nrevive the fraternity. The force consists of three inspectors, nine\r\nsergeants, and a body of police termed \"plain-clothes men,\" whose services\r\ncan be had at any moment. There are about six policemen in each division,\r\nwho take upon themselves the duty of detectives when wanted, which affords\r\na total number of 108 auxiliaries, upon whom the inspectors and sergeants\r\ncan rely to carry out their orders with silence and address. In all great\r\ngatherings, these men are distributed among the crowd, dressed according\r\nto the character of the assembly. Thus, at an agricultural meeting,\r\nsmock-frocks are worn, or the dress of a small farmer; at a review, the\r\nhabiliments of a decent mechanic in his Sunday best. In this respect they\r\nfollow the principle of Nature, who protects her creatures from\r\nobservation by giving them coats of a colour somewhat similar to that of\r\nthe soil they inhabit,--to the arctic fox, a fur white as the surrounding\r\nsnow; and to the hare, a coat scarcely distinguishable from the brown\r\nheath in which she makes her form. It is the general rule to station these\r\nplain-clothes men as near as possible to the policemen of their own\r\ndivision, in order that they may be assisted in capturing prisoners.\r\n\r\nMan is eminently a hunting animal, but there is no prey which he follows\r\nwith such zest and perseverance as his fellowman. Some policemen, directly\r\nthey enter the force, show the taste so strongly that they are at once\r\nmarked off for this special service. Others, on the contrary, will remain\r\nyears without detecting a single crime. From among the 6,000 persons\r\ncomposing the force, a splendid field is afforded for selecting good men;\r\nand Bow-street, great as was its fame, did not turn out more intelligent\r\ndetectives than we now possess. The officers, although they are not\r\nhail-fellow-well-met with every thief, as in the last century, still find\r\nit necessary to keep up a personal knowledge of the criminal population,\r\nespecially with that portion of it whose members they may at one time or\r\nother be likely to \"want.\" The detectives, as well as thieves, are\r\ngenerally famous for some particular line of business. One is good at\r\nhousebreakers, another knows how to follow up the swell-mob, and a third\r\nis a crack hand at forgers. By confining themselves to distinct branches\r\nof the art, they acquire an especial sense, as it were, for the work; and\r\nit is remarkable how much their trouble is lightened by the division of\r\nlabour. The detective stands in a very different position from the\r\nordinary policeman; his work, long and laborious though it may be, must,\r\nto succeed, never see the light. Although he may have followed a case for\r\nyears, all the public knows of it is summed up in the four words used by\r\nthe constable who states the charge at the police court--\"from information\r\nI received,\" &c. The detective lays the foundation which, from the\r\nshifting soil he has to deal with, is frequently far more extensive than\r\nthe superstructure. His duty is to pursue the criminal through all his\r\nshiftings and turnings, until the case is clear against him; and then\r\nfearlessly to draw him forth from his hiding-place, as a ferret would a\r\nrabbit, and hand him over to an ordinary constable to bring to the\r\njudgment-seat.\r\n\r\nMuch of the information by which the perpetrators of crimes are discovered\r\ncomes from their own body: thus two thieves fall out, and one, prompted by\r\nrevenge, and stimulated by the hope of a reward, splits upon his\r\nconfederate; or some abandoned woman, jealous of another, gives\r\ninformation which leads to her paramour's apprehension. The revenge taken\r\nby members of the fraternity upon a \"pal\" whose treachery has been\r\ndiscovered, is often so signal, that the utmost caution is exercised in\r\ncommunicating with the police, lest suspicion should be excited. The\r\nconstable, whose aim is to encourage these revelations, must never, by his\r\nwant of address, give any hint of the source from which he receives his\r\ninformation; nay, he finds it necessary sometimes to pursue keenly a false\r\nscent in order to divert attention from the betrayer.\r\n\r\nBetween the detective and the thief there is no ill blood: when they meet\r\nthey give an odd wink of recognition to each other--the thief smiling, as\r\nmuch as to say, \"I am quite safe, you know;\" and the detective replying\r\nwith a look, of which the interpretation is, \"We shall be better\r\nacquainted by-and-by.\" They both feel, in short, that they are using their\r\nwits to get their living, and there is a sort of tacit understanding\r\nbetween them that each is entitled to play his game as well as he can.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the track of an offender, the officers often come across other\r\ncrimes of which they were not aware, and for a time are thrown off the\r\nscent, just as a pack of fox-hounds by a hare which crosses their path. In\r\nsuch cases the only way is to try back until the original trail is found.\r\nIt is not uncommon in this manner to stumble upon a regular network of\r\nroguery, and to discover the whereabouts of parties who have long been\r\n\"wanting.\" The most trivial hint will suffice to put the detective on the\r\nright track: for, like men accustomed to work in the dark, things which to\r\nother persons are invisible, to them appear clear as noon-day. The\r\ngossiping tendency of neighbours is especially useful to them in worming\r\nout secrets. To obtain a single link in a chain of facts, they will often\r\nhang about a house for months, interrogating the newspaper lad, waylaying\r\nthe servant girl as she is going for her supper beer, and picking all he\r\nwants to know out of her as easily as a locksmith picks a lock, and with\r\nquite as little consciousness on the part of the person operated upon.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickens published some excellent papers in the early numbers of\r\n\"Household Words,\" which illustrate admirably the habits of these\r\nofficers. From these we select the following story, not that it is the\r\nmost dramatic, but because it shows the vast number of dodges by which the\r\ndetectives accomplish their ends:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Tally-ho Thompson,' says Sergeant Witchem, after merely wetting his\r\n    lips with his brandy-and-water, 'Tally-ho Thompson was a famous\r\n    horse-stealer, couper, and magsman. Thompson, in conjunction with a\r\n    pal that occasionally worked with him, gammoned a countryman out of a\r\n    good round sum of money, under pretence of getting him a\r\n    situation--the regular old dodge--and afterwards in the \"Hue and Cry\"\r\n    for a horse--a horse that he stole down in Hertfordshire. I had to\r\n    look after Thompson, and I applied myself, of course, in the first\r\n    instance, to discovering where he was. Now, Thompson's wife lived,\r\n    along with a little daughter, at Chelsea. Knowing that Thompson was\r\n    somewhere in the country, I watched the house--especially at post-time\r\n    in the morning--thinking Thompson was pretty likely to write to her.\r\n    Sure enough, one morning the postman comes up, and delivers a letter\r\n    at Mrs. Thompson's door. Little girl opens the door, and takes it in.\r\n    We're not always sure of postmen, though the people at the\r\n    post-offices are always very obliging. A postman may help us, or he\r\n    may not,--just as it happens. However, I go across the road, and I say\r\n    to the postman, after he has left the letter, \"Good morning! how are\r\n    you?\" \"How are _you_?\" says he. \"You've just delivered a letter for\r\n    Mrs. Thompson.\" \"Yes I have.\" \"You didn't happen to remark what the\r\n    post-mark was, perhaps?\" \"No,\" says he, \"I didn't.\" \"Come,\" says I,\r\n    \"I'll be plain with you. I'm in a small way of business, and I have\r\n    given Thompson credit, and I can't afford to lose what he owes me. I\r\n    know he's got money, and I know he's in the country, and if you could\r\n    tell me what the post-mark was, I should be very much obliged to you,\r\n    and you'd do a service to a tradesman in a small way of business that\r\n    can't afford a loss.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I do assure you that I did not\r\n    observe what the post-mark was; all I know is, that there was money in\r\n    the letter--I should say a sovereign.\" This was enough for me, because\r\n    of course I knew that Thompson, having sent his wife money, it was\r\n    probable she'd write to Thompson by return of post to acknowledge the\r\n    receipt. So I said \"Thankee\" to the postman, and I kept on the watch.\r\n    In the afternoon I saw the little girl come out. Of course I followed\r\n    her. She went into a stationer's shop, and I needn't say to you that I\r\n    looked in at the window. She bought some writing-paper and envelopes,\r\n    and a pen. I think to myself, \"That'll do!\"--watch her home again, and\r\n    don't go away, you may be sure, knowing that Mrs. Thompson was writing\r\n    her letter to 'Tally-ho,' and that the letter would be posted\r\n    presently. In about an hour or so, out came the little girl again,\r\n    with the letter in her hand. I went up, and said something to the\r\n    child, whatever it might have been; but I couldn't see the direction\r\n    of the letter, because she held it with the seal upwards. However, I\r\n    observed that on the back of the letter there was what we call a\r\n    kiss--a drop of wax by the side of the seal--and again, you\r\n    understand, that was enough for me. I saw her post the letter, waited\r\n    till she was gone, then went into the shop, and asked to see the\r\n    master. When he came out, I told him, \"Now, I'm an officer in the\r\n    Detective Force; there's a letter with a kiss been posted here just\r\n    now, for a man that I'm in search of; and what I have to ask of you\r\n    is, that you will let me look at the direction of that letter.\" He was\r\n    very civil--took a lot of letters from the box in the window--shook\r\n    'em out on the counter with the faces downwards--and there among 'em\r\n    was the identical letter with the kiss. It was directed, \"Mr. Thomas\r\n    Pigeon, Post-Office, B----, to be left till called for.\" Down I went\r\n    to B---- (a hundred and twenty miles or so) that night. Early next\r\n    morning I went to the post-office; saw the gentleman in charge of that\r\n    department; told him who I was; and that my object was to see and\r\n    track the party that should come for the letter for Mr. Thomas Pigeon.\r\n    He was very polite, and said, \"You shall have every assistance we can\r\n    give you; you can wait inside the office; and we'll take care to let\r\n    you know when anybody comes for the letter.\" Well, I waited there\r\n    three days, and began to think that nobody ever _would_ come. At last\r\n    the clerk whispered to me, \"Here! Detective! Somebody's come for the\r\n    letter!\" \"Keep him a minute,\" said I, and I ran round to the outside\r\n    of the office. There I saw a young chap with the appearance of an\r\n    ostler holding a horse by the bridle, stretching the bridle across the\r\n    pavement while he waited at the post-office window for the letter. I\r\n    began to pat the horse, and that; and I said to the boy, \"Why, this is\r\n    Mr. Jones's mare!\" \"No, it a'nt.\" \"No?\" said I: \"she's very like Mr.\r\n    Jones's mare!\" \"She a'nt Mr. Jones's mare, anyhow,\" says he: \"it's Mr.\r\n    So-and-So's, of the Warwick Arms.\" And up he jumped, and off he\r\n    went--letter and all. I got a cab, followed on the box, and was so\r\n    quick after him, that I came into the stableyard of the Warwick Arms\r\n    by one gate just as he came in by another. I went into the bar, where\r\n    there was a young woman serving, and called for a glass of\r\n    brandy-and-water. He came in directly, and handed her the letter. She\r\n    casually looked at it without saying anything, and stuck it up behind\r\n    the glass over the chimney-piece. What was to be done next?\r\n\r\n    \"'I turned it over in my mind while I drank my brandy-and-water\r\n    (looking pretty sharp at the letter the while), but I couldn't see my\r\n    way out of it at all. I tried to get lodgings in the house, but there\r\n    had been a horse-fair, or something of that sort, and it was full. I\r\n    was obliged to put up somewhere else, but I came backwards and\r\n    forwards to the bar for a couple of days, and there was the letter,\r\n    always behind the glass. At last I thought I'd write a letter to Mr.\r\n    Pigeon myself, and see what that would do. So I wrote one, and posted\r\n    it; but I purposely addressed it, Mr. John Pigeon, instead of Mr.\r\n    Thomas Pigeon, to see what _that_ would do. In the morning (a very wet\r\n    morning it was) I watched the postman down the street, and cut into\r\n    the bar, just before he reached the Warwick Arms. In he came presently\r\n    with my letter. \"Is there a Mr. John Pigeon staying here?\" \"No!--stop\r\n    a bit though,\" says the barmaid; and she took down the letter behind\r\n    the glass. \"No,\" says she, \"it's Thomas, and _he_ is not staying here.\r\n    Would you do me a favour, and post this for me, as it is so wet?\" The\r\n    postman said \"Yes:\" she folded it in another envelope, directed it,\r\n    and gave it him. He put it in his hat, and away he went.\r\n\r\n    \"'I had no difficulty in finding out the direction of that letter. It\r\n    was addressed, \"Mr. Thomas Pigeon, Post-Office, R----,\r\n    Northamptonshire, to be left till called for.\" Off I started directly\r\n    for R----. I said the same at the post-office there as I had said at\r\n    B----; and again I waited three days before anybody came. At last\r\n    another chap on horseback came. \"Any letters for Mr. Thomas Pigeon?\"\r\n    \"Where do you come from?\" \"New Inn, near R----.\" He got the letter,\r\n    and away _he_ went at a canter.\r\n\r\n    \"'I made my inquiries about the New Inn, near R----, and hearing it\r\n    was a solitary sort of house, a little in the horse line, about a\r\n    couple of miles from the station, I thought I'd go and have a look at\r\n    it. I found it what it had been described, and sauntered in to look\r\n    about me. The landlady was in the bar, and I was trying to get into\r\n    conversation with her; asked her how business was, and spoke about the\r\n    wet weather, and so on; when I saw, through an open door, three men\r\n    sitting by the fire in a sort of parlour or kitchen, and one of those\r\n    men, according to the description I had of him, was Tally-ho Thompson!\r\n\r\n    \"'I went and sat down among 'em, and tried to make things agreeable;\r\n    but they were very shy--wouldn't talk at all--looked at me and at one\r\n    another in a way quite the reverse of sociable. I reckoned 'em up, and\r\n    finding that they were all three bigger men than me, and considering\r\n    that their looks were ugly--that it was a lonely place--railroad\r\n    station two miles off--and night coming on--thought I couldn't do\r\n    better than have a drop of brandy-and-water to keep my courage up. So\r\n    I called for my brandy-and-water; and as I was sitting drinking it by\r\n    the fire, Thompson got up and went out.\r\n\r\n    \"'Now, the difficulty of it was that I wasn't sure it _was_ Thompson,\r\n    because I had never set eyes on him before; and what I had wanted was\r\n    to be quite certain of him. However, there was nothing for it now but\r\n    to follow, and put a bold face upon it. I found him talking outside in\r\n    the yard with the landlady. It turned out afterwards that he was\r\n    wanted by a Northampton officer for something else, and that, knowing\r\n    that officer to be pock-marked (as I am myself), he mistook me for\r\n    him. As I have observed, I found him talking to the landlady outside.\r\n    I put my hand upon his shoulder--this way--and said, 'Tally-ho\r\n    Thompson, it's no use. I know you. I'm an officer from London, and I\r\n    take you into custody for felony!' 'That be d--d!' said Tally-ho\r\n    Thompson.\r\n\r\n    \"'We went back into the house, and the two friends began to cut up\r\n    rough, and their looks didn't please me at all, I assure you. 'Let the\r\n    man go. What are you going to do with him?' 'I'll tell you what I'm\r\n    going to do with him. I'm going to take him to London to-night, as\r\n    sure as I'm alive. I'm not alone here, whatever you may think. You\r\n    mind your own business, and keep yourselves to yourselves. It'll be\r\n    better for you, for I know you both very well.' _I_'d never seen or\r\n    heard of 'em in all my life, but my bouncing cowed 'em a bit, and they\r\n    kept off, while Thompson was making ready to go. I thought to myself,\r\n    however, that they might be coming after me on the dark road to rescue\r\n    Thompson; so I said to the landlady, 'What men have you got in the\r\n    house, missis!' 'We haven't got no men here,' she says, sulkily. 'You\r\n    have got an ostler, I suppose?' 'Yes, we've got an ostler.' 'Let me\r\n    see him.' Presently he came, and a shaggy-headed young fellow he was.\r\n    'Now, attend to me, young man,' says I; 'I'm a detective officer from\r\n    London. This man's name is Thompson. I have taken him into custody for\r\n    felony. I'm going to take him to the railroad station. I call upon\r\n    you, in the Queen's name, to assist me; and mind you, my friend,\r\n    you'll get yourself into more trouble than you know of, if you don't!'\r\n    You never saw a person open his eyes so wide. 'Now, Thompson, come\r\n    along!' says I. But when I took out the handcuffs, Thompson cries,\r\n    'No! None of that! I won't stand _them_! I'll go along with you quiet,\r\n    but I won't bear none of that!' 'Tally-ho Thompson,' I said, 'I'm\r\n    willing to behave as a man to you, if you are willing to behave as a\r\n    man to me. Give me your word that you will come peaceably along, and I\r\n    don't want to handcuff you.' 'I will,' says Thompson, 'but I'll have a\r\n    glass of brandy first.' 'I don't care if I've another,' said I. 'We'll\r\n    have two more, missis,' said the friends; 'and con-found you,\r\n    constable, you'll give your man a drop, won't you?' I was agreeable to\r\n    that; so we had it all round; and then my man and I took Tally-ho\r\n    Thompson safe to the railroad, and I carried him to London that night.\r\n    He was afterwards acquitted on account of a defect in the evidence;\r\n    and I understand he always praises me up to the skies, and says I'm\r\n    one of the best of men.'\"\r\n\r\nThe largest of all the classes of thieves, and that which employs the most\r\nextensive range of intellect, of age, and of dress, is the pickpocket.\r\nFrom the first-rate thief, who works about the banks for six or nine\r\nmonths until he gets a \"good thing\" to the miserable urchin who filches a\r\npocket-handkerchief, how vast a descent! Although strung together by the\r\ncommon thread of crime, and pursuing, as it were, the same line of\r\nbusiness, a duke could not, and certainly would not, look down upon a\r\nstreet-sweeper with half the hauteur that the leading rogues do upon the\r\nFagin-led urchin who replenishes with bandanas the stalls of Field-lane.\r\nThe popular notion of swellmobsmen is far wide of the truth. It is\r\nsupposed that they may be at once recognized by a certain ultra-foppish\r\nmanner of dressing, and an excess of jewellery, whereas the aim of a\r\nprofessor of the \"conveying\" art is to go about his occupation unobserved;\r\nfor to be known to the police is to be disappointed of his booty. He has\r\nhis clothes built by the most correct tailor, and gets himself up as much\r\nlike a gentleman as possible. The necessities of his art, it is true,\r\noblige him to carry a coat over his arm in all weathers; but so may any\r\nveritable man of fashion, without creating suspicion. Still, though he may\r\nmanage to pass free in a crowd, and frequent fashionable assemblies\r\nwithout being suspected by the public, the professed thief-catcher is\r\nrarely to be deceived by appearances. As the hunter marks his quarry by\r\npeculiar signs known only to his craft, so the detective can at once\r\nascertain whether the fine gentleman walking carelessly along is \"wrong,\"\r\nas the slang term is, or a respectable character.\r\n\r\nThe principal sign by which a thief may be distinguished in any assembly\r\nis the wandering of his eye. Whilst those about him are either listening\r\nto a speaker or witnessing a spectacle, his orbits are peering restlessly,\r\nnot to say anxiously around. When the thief-taker sees this, he knows his\r\nman. One of the detective police who attended at the laying of the\r\nfoundation-stone of the Duke of Wellington's College, thus explained to us\r\nthe capture of a gentlemanly-looking person who was present on that\r\noccasion:--\r\n\r\n    \"If you ask me to give my reason why I thought this person a thief the\r\n    moment I saw him, I could not tell you; I did not even know myself.\r\n    There was something about him, as about all swellmobsmen, that\r\n    immediately attracted my attention, and led me to bend my eye upon\r\n    him. He did not appear to notice my watching him, but passed on into\r\n    the thick of the crowd, but then he turned and looked towards the spot\r\n    in which I was--this was enough for me, although I had never seen him\r\n    before, and he had not, to my knowledge, attempted any pocket. I\r\n    immediately made my way towards him, and, tapping him on the shoulder,\r\n    asked him abruptly, 'What do you do here?' Without any hesitation, he\r\n    said, in an under tone, 'I should not have come if I had known I\r\n    should have seen any of you.' I then asked him if he was working with\r\n    any companions, and he said, 'No, upon my word, I am alone;' upon this\r\n    I took him off to the room which we had provided for the safe-keeping\r\n    of the swellmobsmen.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a daring stroke, but it succeeded as it deserved. If the man had\r\nbeen really honest, he would have turned indignantly upon the person who\r\nquestioned him; but pickpockets are essentially cowards, both morally and\r\nphysically, and they generally come down at once to save trouble, when the\r\nofficer has his eye upon them, as the opossums were wont to do when they\r\nespied that dead shot Colonel Crockett. There is a striking example of\r\nthis weakness of their tribe in the amusing work of the \"Englishwoman in\r\nAmerica.\" The scene is an American railway-carriage:--\r\n\r\n    \"I had found it necessary to study physiognomy since leaving England,\r\n    and was horrified by the appearance of my next neighbour. His forehead\r\n    was low, his deep-set and restless eyes significant of cunning, and I\r\n    at once set him down as a swindler or pickpocket. My convictions of\r\n    the truth of my inferences were so strong, that I removed my purse--in\r\n    which, however, acting by advice, I never carried more than five\r\n    dollars--from my pocket, leaving in it only my handkerchief and the\r\n    checks for my baggage, knowing that I could not possibly keep awake\r\n    the whole morning. In spite of my endeavours to the contrary, I soon\r\n    sank into an oblivious state, from which I awoke to the consciousness\r\n    that my companion was withdrawing his hand from my pocket. My first\r\n    impulse was to make an exclamation; my second, which I carried into\r\n    execution, to ascertain my loss; which I found to be the very alarming\r\n    one of my baggage-checks; my whole property being thereby placed at\r\n    this vagabond's disposal, for I knew perfectly well, that if I claimed\r\n    my trunks without my checks, the acute baggage-master would have set\r\n    me down as a bold swindler. The keen-eyed conductor was not in the\r\n    car, and, had he been there, the necessity for habitual suspicion,\r\n    incidental to his position, would so far have removed his original\r\n    sentiments of generosity as to make him turn a deaf ear to my request,\r\n    and there was not one of my fellow-travellers whose physiognomy would\r\n    have warranted me in appealing to him. So, recollecting that my checks\r\n    were marked Chicago, and seeing that the thief's ticket bore the same\r\n    name, I resolved to wait the chapter of accidents, or the reappearance\r\n    of my friends.... With a whoop like an Indian war-whoop the cars ran\r\n    into a shed--they stopped--the pickpocket got up--I got up too--the\r\n    baggage-master came to the door: 'This gentleman has the checks for my\r\n    baggage,' said I, pointing to the thief. Bewildered, he took them from\r\n    his waistcoat-pocket, gave them to the baggage master, and went\r\n    hastily away. I had no inclination to cry 'Stop thief!' and had\r\n    barely time to congratulate myself on the fortunate impulse which had\r\n    led me to say what I did, when my friends appeared from the next car.\r\n    They were too highly amused with my recital to sympathize at all with\r\n    my feelings of annoyance; and one of them, a gentleman filling a high\r\n    situation in the East, laughed heartily, saying, in a thoroughly\r\n    American tone, 'The English ladies must be 'cute customers' if they\r\n    can outwit Yankee pickpockets.'\"\r\n\r\nThe quickness and presence of mind of this lady was worthy of the\r\npractised skill of the detective who marked his man at the Wellington\r\nCollege ceremonial. That same gathering afforded another example of the\r\ncowardice of the swell mob. Immediately they came upon the ground,\r\nfourteen of them were netted before they had time to try the lightness of\r\ntheir fingers. They were confined in a single room with only two policemen\r\nto guard them, yet they never attempted to escape, although their\r\napprehension was illegal, but waited patiently until the crowd had\r\ndispersed. When the doors were thrown open, they immediately made a rush\r\nlike so many rats from a trap, and never stopped until they were well out\r\nof sight of the police. The rapidity with which they bolted was caused by\r\ntheir desire to avoid being paraded before the assembled constables, a\r\nmeasure which is often taken by the police, in order that they may know\r\ntheir men on another occasion. If, however, the swellmobsman's eye is for\r\never wandering in search of his prey, so also is that of the detective;\r\nand instances may occur when the one may be mistaken for the other. At the\r\nopening of the Crystal Palace, a party of detectives distributed among the\r\ncrowd, observed several foreigners looking about them in a manner\r\ncalculated to rouse their suspicions. These individuals were immediately\r\ntaken into custody, notwithstanding their strong and vehement\r\nexpostulations made in very good French. When brought before the\r\ninspector, it came out that they were Belgian police, sent over at the\r\nrequest of our Government to keep a look out on the _mauvais sujets_ of\r\ntheir own nation.\r\n\r\nThe swellmobsmen proper generally work together at races, in gangs of from\r\nthree to seven; those who \"cover,\" as it is termed, making a rush to\r\ncreate pressure, in order that the pickpocket may use his hand without\r\nbeing noticed. In taking watches it is generally supposed that the ring\r\nis cut by a pair of wire-nippers. This is rarely the case; thieves have no\r\ntime in operating to use any other implement than their own nimble\r\nfingers, and the ring of the watch is wrenched off with the utmost ease,\r\nas the purchase upon it is very great. A police magistrate, of large\r\nexperience, suggests that the way to baffle the fraternity would be to\r\n_make the ring work upon a swivel_. Inferior classes of thieves work in\r\nsmaller \"schools,\" say of a couple of women and a boy, whose little hand\r\nis capitally adapted for the work. Whilst one woman pushes, the lad\r\nattempts the pocket of the person nearest him, and the third \"watches it\r\noff,\" as it is called; if she observes that the youth's attentions have\r\nbeen noticed, she immediately draws him back with a \"Ha, Johnny, why do\r\nyou push the lady so!\" Look to your pockets, good reader, when you see\r\nforward little Johnnies about--especially at railway stations. Such places\r\nare the chief resort of this class of pickpockets, and we hear that\r\ntheatres and churches, just as the people are coming out, are favourite\r\nhaunts--the women creating a stoppage at the door, and the children taking\r\nadvantage of it. Women's pockets are much more easily picked than men's,\r\nfor the reason that the opening through the dress to it is larger, and it\r\nhangs by its weight free of the person. In a crowd, the operation is easy\r\nenough, as the general pressure masks the movement of the depredator's\r\nhand; when the victim is walking, a more artistic management is required.\r\nThe hand is inserted at the moment that the right leg is thrown forward,\r\nbecause the pocket then hangs behind the limb, an essential condition for\r\nthe thief, as the slightest motion is otherwise felt upon the leg. The\r\ntrowser-pockets of a man are never attempted in the streets: but in a\r\ncrowd, as at a race, he can be cleaned out by a school of mobsmen of\r\neverything in his possession, with little fear of detection. The first\r\nstep is to select their victim; to do this demands some caution; and if\r\nthey cannot see whether he carries a purse, and if they have no\r\nopportunity of watching him pull it out, they will feel all his pockets.\r\nThe \"spotter,\" as he is called, passes his hand across the clothes\r\nseemingly in the most accidental manner; sometimes twice when he is in\r\ndoubt. The fact that there is booty being ascertained, the confederates\r\nsurround him, and wait for the coming-off of a race. Just as the horse is\r\nat the winning-post, there is a rush forward of the crowd: of this the\r\nmobsmen take advantage, while the victim, perhaps, for better security,\r\nkeeps his hand over his pocket, but in vain. At a critical moment the man\r\nbehind tips his hat over his eyes, instinctively he lifts up his hand to\r\nset it right, and the next moment his pocket is hanging inside out. Few\r\nbetting men who attend much at races have escaped being thoroughly cleaned\r\nout. It is rarely that Londoners are robbed in the streets; they are too\r\nbusy, and move on too fast. Country people form the chief game of the\r\nlight-fingered gentry: as they stare about, they instantly betray\r\nthemselves to their watchful enemy, and in the midst of their admiration\r\nat everything about them, fall an easy prey. The thief in search of purses\r\nor handkerchiefs always makes his way trout-like against the stream. There\r\nare places, which, to carry out our piscatorial analogy, seem\r\n\"ground-baited\" for these fishers. Temple Bar, St. Paul's Churchyard, the\r\nShoreditch end of Bishopsgate, Holborn, Cheapside, and other crowded\r\nthoroughfares, all afford excellent sport for the pickpockets, and any one\r\nacquainted with their \"manners and customs\" may occasionally see them\r\nexercising their craft at these localities, if he watches narrowly. They\r\nlook out for a temporary stoppage in the stream of people, and a horse\r\nfallen in the highway, an altercation between a cabman and his fare, a\r\nfight, a crowd round a picture-shop, are all excellent opportunities, of\r\nwhich they instantly take advantage.\r\n\r\nThe May meetings at Exeter Hall, however, form the most splendid harvests\r\nfor the pickpocket. If the members of the various religious denominations\r\nwho flock thither escape the hustle on the hall stairs, they are waited\r\nupon with due attention in the omnibus. Ladies and gentlemen who attend\r\nthese May meetings are well known to be \"omnibus people:\" they lodge or\r\nvisit, for the short period of their sojourn in town, either at Islington,\r\nClapham, or Camberwell, and the \"Waterloos\" and the \"Victorias\" are\r\nfollowed by the fraternity as certainly as a sick ship in the tropics is\r\nfollowed by the sharks. Omnibuses are generally \"worked\" by a man and a\r\nwoman; the woman seats herself on the right-hand side of the most\r\nrespectable-looking female passenger she can see, and the man if possible\r\ntakes a place opposite the individual to be operated upon. If she be a\r\nyoung person, the man \"stares her out of countenance,\" and, whilst\r\nconfused by his impertinence, the \"pal,\" by the aid of a cloak thrown over\r\nher arm, or, if a man, by passing his hand through the pocket of his cloak\r\nmade open on the inside for the purpose, is able to rifle her pockets at\r\nleisure. If the victim be a middle-aged or elderly lady, her attention is\r\nengaged in conversation whilst the clearing-out process is going on. The\r\ntrick done, the confederates get out at the first convenient opportunity.\r\nIt is very rarely that a pickpocket pursues his avocation alone; but a\r\ncase has been reported lately in the newspapers, which proves that a\r\nclever artist can work single-handed. A man named William Henry Barber was\r\ncharged at the Worship-street court with robbing a lady of her\r\nportemonnaie in a Stoke Newington omnibus: he was well known to the\r\npolice, but had generally escaped by his adroitness. His manoeuvres were\r\nthus described by a lady, a resident of Stoke Newington, who had been\r\nrobbed by him on a previous occasion:--\r\n\r\n    \"She had got into an omnibus,\" she said, \"at Kingsland, several weeks\r\n    back, to convey her to town, and found herself next to a\r\n    gentlemanly-looking stout man, who was dressed in sober black, with a\r\n    white neckerchief, and apparently a dissenting minister. The gentleman\r\n    gradually encroached upon her, and pressed upon her; but she thought\r\n    nothing of it, as he was very intent upon reading a newspaper the\r\n    whole way--so intent, indeed, that she did not see his face, and he\r\n    did not seem to notice that his newspaper several times partially\r\n    covered her dress. The stranger shortly afterwards got out, and she\r\n    did so also in a few minutes, and upon then placing her hand in her\r\n    pocket to make some purchase, she found that her purse had been\r\n    stolen, and with it seven sovereigns and a quantity of silver.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Dissenting Minister\" had evidently worked the Stoke Newington road\r\nregularly, and no doubt the \"sober black\" and the white handkerchief were\r\nassumed with a perfect knowledge of the \"serious\" class of passenger he\r\nwas likely to encounter in omnibuses running to that suburb. Robberies of\r\nthis kind have enormously increased of late. The security with which\r\npickpockets can work, withdrawn as they are from the surveillance of the\r\npolice, is a great incentive to thieves to take to this particular line of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of what is called a \"school\" of boys, who pick pockets in\r\nconcert, under the eye of a master, must be considerable; for we were\r\nshown, some time since, a bill made out by one of those Fagins for the\r\nboard and lodging of his hopeful youths, from which it appeared that the\r\nregular charge for each was two guineas a week! This person was well known\r\nsome years since on the Surrey side of the water as Mo Clarke. He attended\r\nraces, dressed in the deepest black, with his young assistants in jackets\r\nand turned-down collars; and the whole group, to the eye of the general\r\nobserver, presented the sad spectacle of a widower left with a family of\r\nyoung children to lament the loss of an attached mother. Their appearance\r\ndisarmed suspicion, and enabled them to empty the pockets of those around\r\nthem at their leisure. The subsequent fate of two of the children, though\r\nnursed in hypocrisy and vice, proves that the old saying, \"once a thief\r\nalways a thief,\" is not invariably correct, for they are at the present\r\nmoment flourishing cab and omnibus proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of working out of sight of the police has lately led some of\r\nthe swell mob to go to church, prayer-book in hand, and pick pockets\r\neither in the pews or while the congregation is coming down the aisle.\r\nWomen are the greatest adepts at this kind of thieving, and they are\r\nconstant attendants at confirmations, plundering in sight of the most\r\ntouching rite of the Church. The dress of these females is perfect enough;\r\nbut with them, as with most other members of the swell mob, the finish is\r\nentirely on the outside; they scarcely ever have any education, and the\r\nmoment they open their mouths they betray themselves. This fact is of\r\nespecial service in detecting another large class, of thieves--the\r\nshoplifters. A lady cannot go into the shop of any silkmercer or\r\nlinendraper without being struck with the rude manner in which the shopman\r\nclears the counter immediately the purchaser takes her seat. The\r\nplundering to which they are subjected is some excuse for their\r\nsuspicions, for the assistants cannot tell at first who the customer may\r\nbe, and if expensive goods were left exposed while their backs were\r\nturned, serious robberies would inevitably occur. The value of the manner\r\nof speech, as diagnostic of character, was exemplified not long since at\r\nMessrs. Swan and Edgar's, where a lady-like person asked to look at some\r\n\"wallenciens.\" A watch was kept upon the \"lady,\" and she was speedily\r\ndetected secreting a card of valuable lace.\r\n\r\nThe extent of pilfering carried on even by ladies of rank and position is\r\nvery great; there are persons possessing a mania of this kind so well\r\nknown among the shopkeeping community, that their addresses and\r\ndescriptions are passed from hand to hand for mutual security. The\r\nattendants allow them to secrete what they like without seeming to observe\r\nthem, and afterwards send a bill with the prices of the goods purloined to\r\ntheir houses. Jewellers' shops are especially open to a class of thieving\r\ntermed \"palming.\" One of the gang goes in first, and engages the attention\r\nof the assistant; then another drops in, and makes inquiries for some\r\narticle which is on the other side of the shop; then perhaps a third,\r\nwithout recognizing his companions, follows, and asks for something,\r\nsaying he is in a hurry, as he has to be off by a certain train, and at\r\nthe same time pulls out his watch to show his eagerness to be served. The\r\nshopkeeper's attention is thus diverted from the confederates, who rob the\r\ntrays before them of their valuable contents. Some of these fellows are so\r\ndexterous that, if they perceive any person watching them, they can \"palm\"\r\nback the goods they have secreted, and, on being accused, put on an\r\nappearance of injured innocence, which makes the tradesman believe that\r\nhis own eyes must have deceived him. The higher order of thieves will\r\nsometimes \"ring the changes,\" as it is called. This must be ranked among\r\nthe fine arts of swindling. They will call on first-rate houses, and\r\nrequest to be shown valuable pieces of jewellery, such as diamonds,\r\nnecklaces, and bracelets, which are kept in cases. Having noted the case,\r\nthey go away, promising to call with \"a lady.\" A case exactly similar is\r\nthen made, with which they call a second time, and ask to see the\r\nidentical bracelet they before admired, and substituting the empty case\r\nfor that containing the jewels, depart with an apparent inability to\r\ndecide upon the purchase. Many robberies to a heavy amount have taken\r\nplace in this manner. Jewellers are liable to be attacked from without as\r\nwell as from within. From the narration communicated by a prisoner to\r\nCaptain Chesterton, when governor of Coldbath-fields prison, we extract\r\nthe following method of procedure in what is termed \"starring the\r\nglaze:\"--\r\n\r\n    \"One or two parties divert attention while another 'stars.' This is\r\n    either done by a diamond, or by inserting a small penknife through the\r\n    putty, near the corner of a pane, and cracking it; the wet finger\r\n    carries the crack in any direction; an angle is generally formed. The\r\n    piece is wrought to and through, and then removed; if necessary,\r\n    another piece is 'starred' to allow of the free ingress of the hand.\r\n    In a retired neighbourhood an opportunity is taken of tying the door,\r\n    in order to prevent any one coming out, and on passing of a heavy\r\n    carriage the hand is driven through a square of glass, upon which has\r\n    been laid a piece of strong paper, coated with treacle, to prevent\r\n    noise from the glass falling, and then articles of value are removed.\r\n    This is termed spanking the glaze. At other times the parties\r\n    intending to star go a night or two before and break one of the lower\r\n    squares of glass, a watch is then put upon the shop to know when the\r\n    square is renewed, which, of course, the putty being soft, can be\r\n    removed at pleasure; a piece of leather, upon which is spread some\r\n    pitch, being applied to the square to prevent it falling when pushed\r\n    in. Much time is saved this way.\"\r\n\r\nWe often hear of the march of intellect in thieving, and the height to\r\nwhich its professors have carried it in these latter days. There could be\r\nno greater delusion; all the tricks of card-sharpers, ring-droppers,\r\npurse-cutters, &c., are centuries old, and it does not appear that they\r\nare performed a bit more adroitly now than in the days of Elizabeth. Mr.\r\nCharles Knight, in his charming paper on London rogueries, gives examples\r\nof the tricks of the Shakspearian era, which prove, as he observes, that\r\npickpocketing in all its forms was taught as cleverly in the days of the\r\nTudors as by Fagin and his boys in \"Oliver Twist.\" His account of a school\r\nof thieves discovered in 1585 is an instance:--\r\n\r\n    \"Among the rest they found one Wolton, a gentleman born, and sometimes\r\n    a merchant of good credit, but fallen by time into decay. This man\r\n    kept an alehouse at Smart's Key, near Billingsgate, and after, for\r\n    some misdemeanour, put down, he reared up a new trade of life; and in\r\n    the same house he procured all the cut-purses in the city to repair to\r\n    his house. There was a schoolhouse set up to learn young boys to cut\r\n    purses. Two devices were hung up--one was a pocket and another was a\r\n    purse. The pocket had in it certain counters, and was hung about with\r\n    hawk's bells, and over the top did hang a little scaring bell; the\r\n    purse had silver in it, and he that could take out a counter without\r\n    any noise was allowed to be a public Foyster; and he that could take a\r\n    piece of silver out of the purse without noise of any of the bells,\r\n    was adjudged a judicial nypper, according to their terms of art.\"\r\n\r\nThe tricks we have enumerated all require cunning, lightness of hand, and\r\naddress, rather than strength and courage. As the swellmobsman stands at\r\nthe head of this school, so the cracksman or housebreaker stands on the\r\nhighest pinnacle of the other great division of crime which attains its\r\nends by force and courage. Since the ticket-of-leave system has been in\r\naction, this department has flourished to an alarming degree. The released\r\nconvict re-enters the community with the enlarged experience of the hulks\r\nand with a brutal disregard of danger. Suddenly thrown upon his resources,\r\nwith a blasted character, society leaves him no better means of livelihood\r\nthan his old course of crime. One fellow who was brought up to Bow-street\r\nhad committed no less than four burglaries within three weeks after he had\r\nbeen liberated! Bands of ruffians, with crape masks and with deadly arms,\r\nstand by the bed at dead of night, and, after robbing and terrifying their\r\nvictims, leave them gagged and bound in a manner that would disgrace\r\nbanditti. It is true these burglaries are confined to lonely houses\r\nsituated in the country; but housebreaking has been on the increase of\r\nlate even in the metropolis. Some of the craftsmen have become so expert,\r\nthat no system of bolts or bars is capable of keeping them out. It may be\r\nas well to state, however, that a sheet of iron, on the inside of a panel,\r\nwill often foil the most expert burglars; and all operators of this class\r\nwho have opened their minds upon the subject to the prison authorities\r\nadmit that it is totally impossible, without alarming the inmates, to\r\nforce a window that is lightly barred with a thin iron bar and supplied\r\nwith a bell. A shutter thus protected, and which gives a little with\r\npressure, will not allow the centrebit to work without creating a motion\r\nwhich is sure to ring the alarum.\r\n\r\nMost burglaries of any importance, especially those in which much plate is\r\nstolen, are what is termed \"put up;\" that is, the thieves are in\r\ncorrespondence with servants in the house, or with those that have been\r\ndiscarded. Many robberies that appear to have been accomplished in a most\r\nwonderful manner from without, are committed from within. In \"put up\"\r\nrobberies, however, the thieves seldom allow the confederate in the house\r\nto know when the robbery is to come off, for fear of what is termed a\r\n\"double plant;\" that is, lest the person who originally \"put up\" the\r\nrobbery should, from the stings of conscience, or for other reasons, have\r\nofficers in waiting to apprehend them. It is quite sufficient for adroit\r\nburglars to know where the valuables are kept, and the general\r\narrangements of the house. We are indebted to the Yankees for an extremely\r\nclever method of gaining entrance to hotel bed-chambers, even when the\r\ninmate has fastened the door. The end of the key which projects through\r\nthe lock is seized by a pair of steel pliers, and the door is unlocked\r\nwhilst the traveller sleeps in fancied security. Several robberies of this\r\nkind have lately taken place. The most ingenious pilfering of the \"put up\"\r\nkind we ever heard of occurred many years ago in a large town in\r\nHampshire. A gang of first-rate cracksmen, having heard that a certain\r\nbanker in a country town was in the habit of keeping large sums of money\r\nin the strong box of the banking-house in which he himself dwelt,\r\ndetermined to carry it off. For this purpose the most astute and\r\nrespectable-looking middle-aged man of the gang was despatched to the\r\ntown, to reconnoitre the premises and get an insight into the character of\r\ntheir victim. The banker, he ascertained, belonged to the sect of\r\nPrimitive Methodists, and held what is termed \"love-feasts.\" The cracksman\r\naccordingly got himself up as a preacher, studied the peculiar method of\r\nholding forth in favour with the sect, wore a white neckerchief, assumed\r\nthe nasal whine, and laid in a powerful stock of scripture phrases. Thus\r\narmed, he took occasion to hold forth, and that so \"movingly,\" that the\r\nrumour of his \"discourses\" soon came to the ears of the banker, and he was\r\nadmitted as a guest. His foot once inside the doors, he rapidly \"improved\r\nthe occasion\" in his own peculiar manner. The intimacy grew, and he was\r\nspeedily on such terms of friendship with every one in the house, that he\r\ncame and went without notice. He acquainted himself with the position of\r\nthe strong box, and took impressions in wax of the wards of the locks.\r\nThese he sent up to his pals in town, and in due course was supplied with\r\nfalse keys. With these he opened the strong box, made exact notes of the\r\nvalue and nature of its contents, and replaced everything as he found it.\r\nA plan of the street, the house, and of the particular chamber in which\r\nthe treasure was kept, was then prepared and forwarded to the confederates\r\nin London. He persuaded his kind friend the banker to hold a love-feast on\r\nthe evening fixed for the final stroke. A few minutes before the time\r\nappointed for the robbery, he proposed that the whole assembly should join\r\nwith him in raising their voices to the glory of the Lord. The cracksman\r\nlaboured hard and long to keep up the hymn, and noise enough was made to\r\ncover the designs of less adroit confederates than his own. The\r\npseudo-preacher, to disarm suspicion, remained with his friend for a\r\nfortnight after the theft, and on his departure all the women of the\r\n\"persuasion\" wept that so good a man should go away from among them!\r\n\r\nIn a large number of cases the servants are only the unconscious\r\ninstrument in the hands of the housebreaker. We will venture to say that\r\nmore house robberies are committed through the vanity of servant girls\r\nthan from any other cause. A smart young fellow, having heard that plunder\r\nis to be obtained in a certain house, manages to pick up an acquaintance\r\nwith one of the female domestics, and makes violent love to her. We all\r\nknow how communicative young women are to their sweethearts, and the\r\nconsequence is, that in a short time he gets from her every particular\r\nthat he requires,--the habits of the family, the times of their going out,\r\nthe position of the plate-chest, and the fastenings of the doors. Where\r\nonly a servant of all-work is kept, the process is more simple. The lover\r\ncalls in the absence of the family at church, proposes a walk, and takes\r\ncharge of the street-door key, which, unseen to the girl, is passed to a\r\nconfederate; and whilst the polite lover and his lass are enjoying the\r\ncool of the evening the house is being ransacked. An investigation took\r\nplace at the Lambeth Police Court a few months ago, where the poor girl\r\nwho had been made the tool of the housebreaker attempted to commit suicide\r\nin order to prevent the consequences of her folly. Her account of the\r\nmanner in which the \"plant\" was made upon her, affords a good example of\r\nthe style of \"putting up\" a house robbery:--\r\n\r\n    \"The young man with whom she had casually become acquainted called\r\n    after the family had gone out, and she asked him into the back\r\n    parlour. He then asked her to dress and go out with him, and he\r\n    remained in the back parlour while she dressed. While in the back\r\n    parlour he asked her if she could get a glass of wine, and she told\r\n    him that she could not, as the wine was locked up. He said it did not\r\n    matter, as they should have one when they went out, and that he\r\n    expected to meet his sister at the Elephant and Castle. They then left\r\n    the house and went for a walk, and on reaching the Elephant and Castle\r\n    remained there for some time, waiting for the young man's sister, but\r\n    did not see her. They next proceeded to a public-house, where they had\r\n    a glass of brandy-and-water, and the young man accompanied her to the\r\n    end of the street, where they parted, with the intention that they\r\n    should meet at one o'clock on the following day and spend the\r\n    afternoon together. On going to unlock the door, she found it ajar,\r\n    and on going in, found that the house had been robbed. On discovering\r\n    this, she did not know what to do, but thought she would make up a\r\n    story about thieves having got into the house, and took up the knife\r\n    and chopped her hand; but after this, not knowing how to face her\r\n    master or mistress after being so wicked, she took up the knife again,\r\n    intending to kill herself, and inflicted the wound on her throat.\"\r\n\r\nThis confession was enough for the officers, and her \"young man,\" with his\r\nconfederates, were caught and convicted. The frequency of these robberies\r\nshould put housekeepers on their guard as to what followers are allowed,\r\nlest the \"young man\" should turn out to be a regular cracksman in\r\ndisguise. We bid the housekeeper also beware of another danger that\r\nsometimes threatens him when he has an empty house for a neighbour.\r\nThieves always, if possible, make use of it as a basis of operations\r\nagainst the others. They creep towards the dusk of evening, when the\r\ninmates are generally down stairs, along the parapet, and enter\r\nsuccessively the bedrooms of the adjoining tenements. As many as half a\r\ndozen houses have thus been robbed on the same occasion. Police-constables\r\nalways keep a careful watch upon these untenanted houses, by placing\r\nprivate marks on some part of the premises; and if any of these signs are\r\ndisturbed, they suspect that something is wrong, and make a further\r\nexamination. In the City, where an immense amount of valuable property is\r\nstored in warehouses, the private marks are much more used than in other\r\nportions of the metropolis, and are continually changed, lest they should\r\nbecome known to thieves and be turned to their advantage.\r\n\r\nProfessional beggars are almost without exception thieves; but as they are\r\ngenerally recruited from the lowest portion of the population, they never\r\nattain any of the higher ranks, but confine themselves to petty acts of\r\nfilching, or to cunning methods of circumventing the honest. The\r\nhalf-naked wretch that appears to be addressing the basement floor in\r\npiteous terms, has a fine eye for the spoons he may see cleaning below;\r\nand the shipwrecked sailor just cast ashore from St. Giles's would be an\r\nawkward person to meet with in a dark suburban lane. Professional beggars\r\nare migratory in their habits. They travel from town to town, not in the\r\nfilthy rags we are accustomed to see them in, but in good clothing; the\r\nrags are carried by their women, and are only donned when they are nearing\r\nthe place in which they intend to beg.\r\n\r\nThere is an audacious class of thieves, termed \"dragsmen,\" who plunder\r\nvehicles. At the West End they chiefly operate upon cabs going to or\r\ncoming from the railway stations. As this kind of thieving is carried on\r\nunder the very eyes of the foot-passengers, it is rarely attempted except\r\nin the dusk of the evening. The dragsman manages to hang on behind, as\r\nthough he were merely taking a surreptitious ride, but in reality to cut\r\nleather thongs and undo fastenings, and be able at any convenient moment\r\nto slip off a box or parcel unobserved. The carelessness of the public is\r\nthe best confederate of this sort of thief. In the case of Lady\r\nEllesmere's jewels, the box was put not _inside_, but _outside_, the cab\r\nin which the valet rode, and not in the middle of other boxes, but the\r\n_hindermost_ of all--just the place in which the dragsman would have\r\nplanted it. It is now known that the robbery was effected between Berkeley\r\nSquare and Grosvenor Square, as a man was seen with the package standing\r\nat the corner of Mount Street, Davies Street, bargaining with a cabman to\r\ntake him to the City. The man and his booty were driven to a public-house,\r\nbut the box must have been shifted immediately, for in two hours from the\r\ntime it was lost it was found rifled of its contents in a waste piece of\r\nground in Shoreditch. It might perhaps for a moment be suspected that this\r\nwas a \"put up\" robbery, but we are precluded from adopting this view of\r\nthe case, as it is, we believe, suspected that the man sold the jewels,\r\nwhich were worth perhaps 25,000_l._, for a very trifling sum. He must have\r\nbeen entirely ignorant of their value, and having by a chance stroke\r\nobtained a magnificent booty, threw it away for an old song. Not many\r\nweeks after this extraordinary robbery, a plate-chest of her Majesty was\r\nstolen from a van between Buckingham Palace and the Great Western Railway.\r\nThere were persons walking alongside the vehicle, and it seems marvellous\r\nhow it could be possible to remove unseen a heavy chest under such\r\nconditions; but every facility was given in this case, as in the former,\r\nfor the plunderers to do their work unmolested. In the first place the box\r\nwas put in such a position that its bottom came flush with the ledge of\r\nthe van. Next, the journey from Buckingham Palace to Paddington was, in\r\nthe driver's idea, too far to go without baiting on the way; therefore\r\nbait he did at a little public-house, and every person in charge of the\r\nproperty went inside to drink. According to their own account, they did\r\nnot stop more than a minute; this minute was enough: like Laertes, the\r\nthief might have said, \"'Twill serve.\" In this instance also the box was\r\nfound empty in a field at Shoreditch, and it is believed that a\r\nticket-of-leave man had a hand in both robberies.\r\n\r\nThe habits of thieves have been somewhat modified since the institution of\r\nthe new police, and the adoption of the principle of prevention instead of\r\ndetection, in dealing with the criminal population. In the time of the old\r\nBow-street Runners the different classes of thieves had their houses of\r\ncall, in which they regularly assembled. The arrangement was winked at by\r\nthe magistrates, and approved by the officers, as useful to them in\r\nlooking after offenders that were wanted. John Townsend, when speaking of\r\nthe supposed advantage of these flash houses, said, \"I know\r\nfive-and-twenty, or six-and-twenty years ago, there were four houses where\r\nwe could pop in, and I have taken three or four, or five or six of them at\r\na time, and three or four of them have been convicted, and yet the\r\npublic-house was tolerably well conducted too.\" Perhaps officers who lived\r\nupon the capture of thieves had good reason for maintaining these flash\r\nhouses, in which most robberies were concocted; the case is far different\r\nnow that the police are paid by day rather than by piece-work, by weekly\r\nsalary rather than by blood-money, and all known flash houses have long\r\nbeen discontinued. Some fifteen years since a few remained in the Borough,\r\nbut Superintendent Haynes broke them up, and rooted them out. Thieves\r\ncannot meet now in respectable houses, for if they did, the constables\r\nwould become aware of the fact, and the landlord would speedily lose his\r\nlicense. The passing of the Common Lodging-house Act has also assisted in\r\ndispersing the desperate gangs, one of which, known under the name of \"The\r\nForty Thieves,\" infested the town a few years since. It may be asked, what\r\nsort of mutual fellowship exists among these outcasts who live below the\r\nsurface of \"society\"? Of the seven or eight thousand thieves in the\r\nmetropolis, very few are acquainted with each other; they are, in fact,\r\ndivided into as many sections as are to be found among honest men. Beyond\r\ntheir own peculiar set they do not associate with their kind. The\r\nswell-mobsman is as distinct a being from the cracksman as a Bond-street\r\ndandy from a South-Sea islander; they do not even talk the same slang, and\r\ncould no more practise each other's art, than a shoemaker could make a\r\ntable. These natural divisions of the underground world of rogues\r\nimmensely facilitate the operations of the police. The manner in which\r\nthey do their work is also in some cases a pretty good guide to the\r\ndetectives. Skill and individuality is evinced in unlawful as well as in\r\nlawful pursuits--in the manner in which a door is forced, as much as in\r\nthe style a picture is painted; and a clever officer, after carefully\r\nexamining a door or a window, will sometimes say, \"This looks like\r\n'Whiteheaded Bob's work,'\" or \"'Billy-go-Fast,' must have had a hand in\r\nthis job.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading swell-mobsmen are the only class of thieves who \"touch,\" if we\r\nmay term it, the ordinary society of better men. The practitioner in this\r\nline must dress and be as much like a gentleman as possible, in order to\r\npursue his avocation without suspicion. Accordingly, he lives with a\r\nwoman, who passes for his wife, in genteel lodgings, and generally in the\r\ndrawing-room floor. As his earnings are often very large, he has\r\neverything about him of the most expensive kind; his style of living is\r\nluxurious, and he drinks nothing less than hock and champagne. He\r\nsometimes keeps a banking account, and one man named Brown, lately\r\napprehended, had a balance at his banker's of 800_l._! As the members of\r\nthis fraternity work wholly in the daytime, going out in the morning and\r\nreturning in the evening, the landlady believes that they are engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits, and have business in the City; and, as it is part of\r\ntheir game to pay their way liberally, she esteems them to be model\r\nlodgers!\r\n\r\nThe domestic habits of thieves are all pretty much alike; fluctuating\r\nbetween the prison and the hulks, they exhibit the usual characteristics\r\nof men engaged in dangerous enterprises. They mainly pass their time, when\r\nnot at \"work,\" in gambling, smoking, and drinking, and in listening to the\r\nadventures of their companions. It must be remembered, however, that the\r\nprofessed thief, even if he drinks, is never _drunk_; he is employed in\r\ndesperate undertakings which require him to have his wits about him quite\r\nas much, if not more than the honest man. When a pickpocket is flush of\r\nmoney, he spends it in the most lavish manner,--takes a tour with his\r\nfemale companion to the Isle of Wight, or to any other place he has a wish\r\nto see, and puts up at the best hotels. In some of these trips he thinks\r\nnothing of spending 30_l._ in a fortnight, and when the money is gone he\r\ncomes back again \"to work.\" Thieves are generally faithful to each other;\r\nindeed the community of danger in which they live develops this virtue to\r\nan unusual extent. If a \"pal\" is apprehended, they cheerfully put down\r\ntheir guinea apiece to provide him with counsel for his trial; and if he\r\nshould be imprisoned, they make a collection for him when he comes out. A\r\ncurious circumstance is the rapidity with which news of any of the body\r\nhaving been arrested travels among his companions. We are assured that no\r\nsooner is a young thief captured and taken to the station-house, although\r\nhe may have been plundering far away from his home, than some associate\r\nbrings him his dinner or tea, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe best class of swell-mobsmen sometimes act upon the joint-stock\r\nprinciple \"with limited liabilities.\" When a good thing is in prospect--a\r\ngold-dust robbery or a bank robbery--it is not unusual for several of them\r\nto \"post\" as much as 50_l._ apiece in order to provide the sinews of war\r\nto carry on the plan in a business-like manner. If in the end the job\r\nsucceeds, the money advanced is carefully paid back to the persons\r\nadvancing it--several of whom have lived for years on plunder thus\r\nobtained, without the police being able to detect them. Often the\r\nreceivers make these adventures in crime, and plot the robbery of a\r\njeweller's shop with as much coolness and shrewdness as though it were an\r\nordinary mercantile speculation, and the produce is disposed of in the\r\nsame business-like manner. Watches are what is termed \"re-christened,\"\r\nthat is, the maker's names and numbers are taken out and fresh ones put\r\nin; they are then exported in large quantities to America. All articles of\r\nplate are immediately thrown into the crucible and melted down, so as to\r\nplace them beyond the hope of identification. In many cases, when the\r\nreceiver cannot thoroughly depend upon the thief, it is, we believe,\r\ncustomary to employ intermediate receivers so as to render it impossible\r\nto trace the property to its ultimate destination. It must not be supposed\r\nthat the passion for gain is always the sole incentive to robbery. \"Oh,\r\nhow I do love thieving! If I had thousands, I'd still be thief;\" such were\r\nthe words uttered by a youth in Coldbath-fields Prison, and overheard by\r\nthe governor.[49]\r\n\r\nIf the machinery for preventing and detecting crime has so vastly improved\r\nwithin this present century, the same may be said for the method of\r\ndispensing justice. Up to as late as 1792, the magistrates of\r\nBow-street--the first \"police-office,\" as it was then termed--were paid in\r\nthat most obnoxious of all modes, by fees, which were often obtained in a\r\nmanner so disgraceful that the magistrates got the name of \"trading\r\njustices\" and \"basket justices.\" Our old friend John Townsend, whom we\r\nmust summon once more to our aid, gives an insight into their proceedings,\r\nand he knew them well. He said, \"The plan used to be to issue warrants,\r\nand to take up all the poor devils in the streets, and then there was the\r\nbailing them, 2_s._ 4_d._, which the magistrate had. _In taking up a\r\nhundred girls_, that would make, at 2_s._ 4_d._, 11_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ They\r\nsent none to jail, _for the bailing them was so much better_!\" The old\r\nBow-street worthy then draws a picture of the magistrate settling the\r\namount of these ill-gotten fees with his clerk on the Monday morning. The\r\n\"basket justices\" were so called, because they allowed themselves to be\r\nbought over by presents of baskets of game. These enormities were so\r\nglaring, that, according to Townsend, \"they at last led to the Police\r\nBill, and it was a great blessing to the public to do away with these men,\r\nfor they were nothing better than the encouragers of blacklegs, vice, and\r\nplunderers. There is no doubt about it.\" In 1792 seven other \"offices\"\r\nwere established, namely, Queen-square, Great Marlborough-street, Hatton\r\nGarden, Worship-street, Lambeth, Shadwell, and Union-street, each office\r\nhaving three magistrates, who did the duties alternately. These, by the\r\naddition of the suburban courts, have since been augmented to eleven. They\r\nform the judgment-seats to which all offenders in this great capital of\r\n2,500,000 inhabitants are brought, either to be punished summarily, or to\r\nbe remanded to the sessions to take their trial.\r\n\r\nThe police-courts may be likened to so many shafts sunk in the smooth\r\nsurface of society, through which the seething mass of debauchery,\r\nviolence, and crime, are daily bubbling up before the public eye. A\r\nspectator cannot sit beside the magistrate on the bench for a couple of\r\nhours without feeling that there are currents of wickedness flowing among\r\nthe population as fixedly as the trade-winds in the tropics. A panorama\r\nof sin passes before his eye which he shudders to think is only like a\r\nsingle thread drawn from the fabric of vice which underlies the whole\r\nsystem of elegant, punctilious, and accomplished metropolitan life. On\r\nevery case that comes before him the magistrate unassisted has to decide\r\nrapidly and justly, unless he desires to call down upon his head the\r\nthunders of an ever-watchful press. In addition to his judicial duties, he\r\nhas to answer numberless questions, and to give advice upon law points to\r\ndistressed persons: and all this amid a pestilential atmosphere which is\r\ncalculated to depress both body and mind. Nevertheless, the work is done\r\nadmirably, and justice, as speedy as that dispensed by cadis in Eastern\r\ntales, and much more impartial, is dealt to the throng brought before him.\r\n\r\nFrom an analysis of the Criminal Returns of the Metropolitan Police, it is\r\napparent that crimes have their peculiar seasons. Thus attempts to commit\r\nsuicide generally occur in the months of June, July, and August, and\r\nrarely in November, according to the commonly accepted notion; comfort, it\r\nis evident, is considered even in the accomplishment of this desperate\r\nact. Common assaults and drunkenness also multiply wonderfully in the\r\ndog-days. In the winter, on the contrary, burglaries increase, and, for\r\nsome unknown reason, the uttering of counterfeit coin.\r\n\r\nThe character of the cases brought before the police-courts varies, in\r\nsome degree, according to the neighbourhood and other causes. Bow-street\r\nstill maintains the pre-eminence over the other courts which it exercised\r\nin the old days, when the horse-patrol and the detective police, known as\r\nthe Bow-street runners, were in existence; and this it does in consequence\r\nof its special jurisdiction over persons who are amenable to foreign law.\r\nThe cases of this class--arson, murder, or bankruptcy--are heard in\r\nprivate, generally by the chief magistrate, and the depositions are\r\nforwarded direct to the Foreign Office. Ticket-of-leave men who have\r\ncommitted fresh offences, are here deprived of their tickets and\r\napprehended by a warrant from the Home-Office. All Inland Revenue and\r\nPost-Office cases, such as stealing from letters, are adjudicated upon\r\nexclusively at Bow-street, which is, in fact, _the_ Government office.\r\n\r\nThe Thames police deals with mutinies and murders committed on the high\r\nseas, and all disputes under the Mercantile Marine Act come as a matter of\r\ncourse to this court, together with the major portion of the criminals,\r\nthe scene of whose offences is in the docks and on the river. Drunkenness,\r\nthe vice of the sailors, and the insubordination arising out of it, form a\r\nvery large portion of the charges of the district. Worship-street is\r\nfamous, or rather infamous, for wife-beaters. The reason is curious, and\r\nsupplies a hint to philanthropists to reform the dwellings of the poor,\r\nrather than pass harsh acts of parliament against the husbands, which in\r\nmany cases only serve to aggravate the evils arising from their brutality.\r\nThe majority of the wife-beaters come from Bethnal-green, where there are\r\na great number of large old mansions let out to the working-classes in\r\nfloors or flats. Sometimes as many as twenty families live in the same\r\nhouse. The children play about in the passages as a neutral ground,\r\ndisputes arise, and the mothers take the parts of their respective\r\noffspring with discordant fierceness. This drives the men to the\r\npublic-houses, where they drink their porter _iced_ and listen to more\r\npleasant sounds in the shape of gratuitous concerts. The wives in turn are\r\ndriven to the tavern doors to seek their mates, with words not too\r\nconciliatory, and are brutally assaulted by the drunken husbands, who are\r\ntaken up the next day and get six months' imprisonment, _the family being\r\nin most instances irretrievably broken up and ruined thereby_. Some of the\r\nmagistrates, seeing the baleful working of the system, have attempted a\r\nsolution of the difficulty by making the husband promise to allow the wife\r\nto receive his weekly wages from his master, whose consent to the\r\narrangement has been given. In many instances this plan has worked well,\r\nsince the husband knows that on the slightest infringement of the\r\nagreement his spouse may give him six months' imprisonment, judgment in\r\nthe case having been only suspended. But this power, again, is often\r\nabused by the woman, and it is a common thing for them on the least\r\nthreat of their mates to say, \"Mind what you are about, or I will give you\r\n'a sixer.'\"\r\n\r\nCases of begging are principally heard at the Marlborough-street\r\npolice-court, as the rich streets in its neighbourhood are the main scenes\r\nof the nuisance. Blind beggars especially affect Regent-street,\r\nOxford-street, and Piccadilly, the most thronged thoroughfares in the West\r\nEnd. We warn our readers against their charitable tendencies for these\r\npeople. If the truth was known, the cry, \"Pity the poor blind!\" far from\r\nexciting their pity, would arouse their disgust. Blind beggars, as a\r\nclass, are the most profligate scoundrels in the metropolis, thinking of\r\nnothing but their grosser appetites, and plundering the charitable for\r\ntheir satisfaction. One of these men lately taken into custody was\r\ndiscovered seated at the breakfast-table with ham and fourteen poached\r\neggs before him! At the Westminster police-court the foot-guards are\r\ncontinually visitors against their will; but it is remarked as\r\nextraordinary that not one of the horse-guards has been charged here for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA custom has grown up of making the police magistrates the almoners of the\r\npublic in cases which have attracted the attention of the charitable\r\nthrough the medium of the press. Many a poor forsaken creature has\r\nsuddenly found himself not only famous, but comparatively rich, by the\r\nsimple process of telling his tale in one of these courts. The news of it\r\nflies through the country in the pages of the _Times_, and in the course\r\nof two or three mornings the magistrate is oppressed with post-office\r\norders for the benefit of the sufferer, the donors simply requesting that\r\ntheir gifts should be acknowledged in the public journals. The annual\r\nreceipts at the different courts for special cases must amount to a large\r\nsum; and there is in addition a constant flow of small sums towards the\r\npoor-box, the contents of which are distributed at the discretion of the\r\nmagistrate. The annual income from this latter source is about 300_l._ per\r\nannum at Marlborough-street, and at Bow-street respectively, the greater\r\nportion of which is given to deserving objects whose cases have come\r\nbefore the court, and the remainder is dispensed at Christmas to the poor\r\nof the neighbourhood in the shape of coals and candles. We are\r\nparticularly anxious to make this fact known, in order that the charitable\r\nmay be aware that their gifts are well bestowed. The magistrates do not,\r\nwe believe, encourage these donations, as they consider that the\r\ndistribution of alms is incompatible with their office; but, on the other\r\nhand, it cannot be denied that a vast amount of temporary aid is thus\r\ngiven to persons whose needs cannot be satisfied by the union workhouse.\r\nDeserving people are often furnished with the means of obtaining a\r\nlivelihood, workmen whose tools have been burned in a conflagration\r\nsupplied with new ones, and in some cases women left behind by their\r\nhusbands, under circumstances of peculiar hardship, have been provided\r\nwith a passage to Australia. The thousands in England who only want to\r\nknow where genuine misfortune exists to hasten to its relief, have a\r\ngreater guarantee that they will not be imposed upon by these cases at the\r\npolice-courts than by private solicitations, as the magistrates have the\r\nmeans of sifting the statements of applicants. Nevertheless, even these\r\nastute public servants are now and then deceived, and comparatively large\r\nsums have been received by them for persons who have afterwards been\r\nascertained to be unworthy of relief; and in instances where the discovery\r\ntook place in time, the money, by the direction of the donors, has been\r\ntransferred to truer objects of charity.\r\n\r\nThe fees, penalties, and forfeitures received at the eleven metropolitan\r\npolice-courts and by the justices of the exterior police districts are\r\nvery considerable; in 1855 they amounted to 11,315_l._ 16_s._ 6_d._ This\r\nsum goes towards defraying the expenses of the courts, which, together\r\nwith the salaries of the officers, and other items, amounted in the same\r\nyear to 63,021_l._ 0_s._ 5_d._ The expenditure may be considered\r\nreasonable, when it is remembered that 60,000 cases are annually disposed\r\nof, many of which require a minute knowledge of statute and of common law.\r\nThe chief improvement required is the improvement of the buildings. The\r\nThames police-court is the only one at all suitable for its purpose. An\r\nenclosed yard is attached to it, in which the police-van can draw up and\r\ndischarge its prisoners without exposing them to the public gaze, an\r\nimportant point in times of public excitement. Clerkenwell and Westminster\r\nare the next best-arranged courts, but both want space and air; Lambeth,\r\nthough lately built, is a complete failure; many of the other courts are\r\nheld in small private houses; and in those of Marlborough Street and\r\nHammersmith, the business is transacted up stairs. In the latter court it\r\nis a common thing to hear it said of persons who have been taken before\r\nthe magistrates--\"he has been up the forty steps.\" With the common people,\r\nwith whom these institutions have mainly to deal, justice should be\r\ndispensed with regard to appearances; there should be the formality of the\r\nsuperior courts, and somewhat of their show. A magistrate sitting in a\r\nplain black dress like an ordinary gentleman, and a lawyer dispensing\r\njustice in his wig and gown, are two very different things to the lower\r\nclasses, whatever they may be to educated persons; and the want of all\r\nofficial costume, and the huddled style of doing business, inseparable\r\nfrom the present confined space, is not calculated to inspire the people\r\nwith much respect. The police should at least be put upon a level with the\r\ncounty-courts. The latter have to deal with less momentous interests.\r\nQuestions of paltry debt cannot be put in comparison with questions\r\ninvolving the liberty of the subject; the power of committing to prison\r\nfor six months with hard labour is far more important than that of\r\nadjudicating in money disputes under five pounds. It is not enough that\r\njustice is administered; it is the opinion which the people have of it\r\nthat produces the effect, and until the judgment-seat is rendered\r\ndignified, and those who sit on it are clothed with the habiliments which\r\ndistinguish the magistrate from the man, the law, by losing most of its\r\nimpressiveness, will lose its moral power over delinquents. The vulgar\r\nterror of punishment may remain, but the lesson which is conveyed to the\r\nfeelings by the solemn stateliness of the tribunal is entirely gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTALITY IN TRADES AND PROFESSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is but natural to suppose, that in such a busy hive of industry as\r\nEngland, where so large a proportion of the population--at least\r\none-half--is engaged in the prosecution of arts and manufactures, that the\r\neffects of unceasing toil, and the debilitating influences of many\r\nemployments, will have a certain effect upon the health and longevity of\r\nthe artisan. We cannot pit the tender muscles of the child against the\r\nsenseless energy of steam, without producing a strain upon the vital\r\nprinciple of the workers which must be highly injurious to it. We cannot\r\nconsign a population as large as that of many German States to live\r\nperpetually in the bowels of the earth, without being prepared for an\r\nincreased death-rate. The hundreds of diverse manufactures and\r\nhandicrafts, which make the land hum with labour, must all be prosecuted\r\nunder circumstances more or less inimical to perfect health. If we take\r\nthe agricultural labourer of the better class, whose daily toil is\r\nperformed under the roof of heaven, it must be clear that all trades which\r\npursue their monotonous vocations in the crowded workshops of crowded\r\ncities, in constrained attitudes, and subject to debilitating emanations,\r\nmust, to a certain extent, fall short of his standard of health.\r\nNevertheless, we do not think the public are prepared for the state of\r\nthings which a close examination of the sanitary condition of certain\r\nportions of the working population divulges. Accustomed to be furnished\r\nwith all the appliances of easy life and luxury, the great middle and\r\nupper classes have never perhaps given a thought as to the manner in\r\nwhich these wants and appliances are supplied. Accustomed to sip the\r\nhoney, it never strikes us that perhaps its product involves in some cases\r\nthe life of the working-bee. Yet the lady, who, from the silken ease of\r\nher fauteuil, surveys her drawing-room, may learn a lesson of compassion\r\nfor the poor workman in nearly every article that lies before her. Those\r\nglazed visiting cards, if they could speak, possibly could tell of the\r\nparalyzed hand that made them; that splendid mirror, which lights up the\r\nstately room, has, without doubt, reflected the trembling form of the\r\nemaciated Italian artificer poisoned with mercurial fumes; those hangings,\r\nso soft and delicate, may have produced permanent disease to the weaver,\r\nwhose stomach has been injured by its constant pressure against the beam;\r\nthe porcelain vase on the bracket has dragged the \"dipper's\" hand into a\r\npoison that, sooner or later, will destroy its power, and, may-be, produce\r\nin him mania and death; nay, the very paper on the walls, tinted with all\r\nthe vernal brightness of spring, has, for all we know, ulcerated with its\r\npoisonous dust the fingers of the hanger. The history of the manufacture\r\nof almost every article of elegance or _virtù_ would disclose to us\r\npictures of workmen transiently or permanently disabled in the production\r\nof them. All this suffering--much of it totally preventible--goes on\r\nwithout complaint, the workman falls out of the ranks, and another\r\ninstantly takes his place, to be succeeded perhaps by a third. We are\r\nconvinced that such a waste of health and life could not be endured, if\r\nthe public were fully alive to the magnitude of the evil; for this reason\r\nwe shall endeavour, in the following essay, to give a true picture of what\r\nmay, perhaps, without pedantry, be termed the pathology of industrial\r\noccupations and professions in this country.\r\n\r\nForemost among those artisans who suffer from the inhalation of dust and\r\nother gritty particles given off in the pursuit of their employment are\r\nthe grinders of Sheffield. Dr. J. C. Hall, in a series of papers published\r\nlately in the _British Medical Journal_, draws a picture of the condition\r\nof these unfortunate men, which is indeed appalling, and without doubt\r\ngives them the bad pre-eminence of pursuing the most deadly trade in\r\nexistence. Grinding is divided into dry, wet, and mixed; that is, the\r\nvarious articles of steel turned out of the cutler's shop of Sheffield are\r\nsubjected to the stone entirely dry, revolving in water, or to processes\r\ninvolving both methods. Of the three, the former is by far the most\r\ndeadly: forks, needles, brace-bits, &c., are ground entirely on the dry\r\nstone, and the amount of finely-divided metal dust and siliceous grit\r\ngiven out in the process may be imagined, when we state that a dozen of\r\nrazors, weighing 2lb. 4oz. as they come from the forge in the rough, lose\r\nin the process of \"shaping\" on the dry stone, upwards of five ounces, and\r\nthe stone itself, seven inches in diameter, would be reduced one inch. To\r\nreceive the mixture of stone and steel thus rapidly given off, the\r\nposition of the grinder is but too convenient; straddled across his\r\n\"horsing,\" as the frame in which the grindstone revolves is called, with\r\nhis knees bent in an acute angle, his body inclined forwards, and his head\r\nhanging over the work, his mouth is brought into fatal contact with the\r\npoisonous dust, and his eyes with the rush of the sparks. Fork-grinding is\r\nperformed entirely on the dry stone, and consequently it is the most\r\ndeadly occupation pursued in Sheffield. About 500 men and boys are at\r\npresent devoting themselves to destruction during the period of early\r\nmanhood, for the benefit of the users of steel forks. \"The silver fork\r\nschool\" imagines perhaps that these vile appliances have long been\r\nbanished to the same limbo as snuffers, and will be surprised to learn\r\nthat more steel forks than ever are thus fashioned in Sheffield, and the\r\npoor grinder, as he receives into his lungs the products of the\r\nfashioning, in his own person exemplifies the awful passage in the\r\nburial-service--\"dust to dust\"--as the disease thus induced cuts him off\r\nat the average age of twenty-nine years! \"I shall be thirty-six years old\r\nnext month,\" remarked a grinder, pathetically, to Dr. Hall, \"and you know,\r\nmeaster, that's getting _a very old man_ in our trade.\" Another operation,\r\nalmost as deadly as fork-grinding, is that of \"racing the stone.\" These\r\ngrindstones are but roughly reduced to the circular form by the quarry\r\nmen, and the grinder undertakes the business of reducing and removing all\r\ntheir asperities, which he does by revolving them against a piece of\r\nsteel--a tremendous dust being given off in the process. In wet grinding,\r\nwhich is employed in the manufacture of saws, files, sickles,\r\ntable-knives, and edge-tools, comparatively little dust is made, and in\r\nthese employments the grinders enjoy comparatively longer life; their\r\naverage age ranging from thirty-five to forty years. In addition to the\r\ndestructive effects of these particles of metal and stone upon the\r\ndelicate membrane of the lungs, the dry-grinder is subjected to serious\r\ninjury of the eyes from the red-hot particles of steel thrown off in the\r\nshape of sparks. The more careful of the workmen protect themselves from\r\nthe danger, however, by wearing large spectacles of ordinary window glass.\r\nThese spectacles, when they have been in use a little time, give practical\r\nevidence of their utility, for on examining them they are found to be\r\nspeckled all over with the particles of steel, which, when red-hot, become\r\nembedded in the glass.\r\n\r\nIn the rough nomenclature of the trade, the disease which thus early\r\ndestroys the fashioner of forks and needles is termed the _grinder's rot_.\r\nThe lung, when examined after death, looks as though it had been dipped in\r\nink, and the texture, instead of exhibiting the usual spongy character of\r\nthat organ when in health, cuts like a piece of india-rubber! The colour\r\nand the solidification of the dry-grinder's lung is owing to the chronic\r\ninflammation to which it has been subjected by the presence from an early\r\nage of irritating particles of steel and stone within its finest air\r\npassages. But why dry-grind at all, the reader will involuntarily exclaim,\r\nif the wages of the occupation are death? The grinder replies, that there\r\nare certain operations which cannot be done on the wet stone; giving the\r\nrounded back to razors, technically called \"humping,\" and the rounded side\r\nto scissors, are quoted as examples. The pressure during the process of\r\nshaping is so great, that the rolling friction would speedily make the\r\nstone wear, and the workman would be unable to hold the blade upon it.\r\nThen, again, we may ask, where is the necessity for this rounded\r\nform--would the shaver on a cold morning care a jot whether his razor had\r\na round or a square back? Would the lady, as she manipulated her lace-work\r\nwith her scissors, hesitate to accept a three-sided scissor-leg in place\r\nof a half-round one, if she knew that the difference involved the life of\r\na fellow-creature? Yet such trifling differences as these between round\r\nand flat, stand in the way of the health or misery of an entire class of\r\nworkers! We give a list of the average duration of life of artisans in\r\nsteel in Sheffield:--Dry-grinders of forks, 29 years; razors, 31 years;\r\nscissors, 32 years; edge-tool and wool-shears, 32 years; spring-knives, 34\r\nyears; table-knives, 35 years; files, 35 years; saws, 38 years; sickles,\r\n38 years--the ascending longevity being in proportion to the amount of\r\nwater used on the stone, and to the greater amount of adult labour\r\nemployed; such articles as saws, sickles, and tools are happily too heavy\r\nto be manipulated by the children employed, and thus early diseased in the\r\nmanufacture of the lighter articles.\r\n\r\nThe only relief to be gathered from this dismal picture of wasted life, is\r\nthe fact that things are not so bad as of old. By means of greater speed\r\nbeing given to the stone, many articles, such as pen and pocket-knives,\r\nare now ground with a wet stone that formerly were ground with the dry;\r\nand happily much of the dust has been abolished in the best shops, such as\r\nthat of Messrs. Rodgers, by the introduction of fans on the principle of a\r\nwinnowing-machine, which blows the dust and grit as it comes from the\r\ngrindstone clear away through a flue placed in connection with the\r\nchimney. This fan is, however, only partially used; the grinders\r\nthemselves, whom they are intended to benefit, complaining that the \"trade\r\nis bad enough as it is, and if men lived longer, it would be so over-full\r\nthat there would be no such a thing as getting a living:\" the same spirit\r\nrejected Mr. Abraham's mask of magnetized wire, invented many years ago\r\nfor the same object. There can be no doubt, however, that intelligence\r\nshould rule in this matter, and that the Legislature should make it a\r\nfineable offence to work a dry stone without a fan, just as it is to work\r\ndangerous machinery without guards; for where one life is lost by neglect\r\nin the latter case, thousands sink into a premature grave in the former.\r\nGrinders, wet or dry, may also protect their lungs, in a most remarkable\r\nmanner, by simply allowing the beard and moustache to grow. The hirsute\r\nappendages of the upper lip and chin are Nature's respirators, and it has\r\nbeen observed that those men who have allowed her in this respect to have\r\nher way, have discovered that she is somewhat wiser than fashion or\r\npopular usage.\r\n\r\nOf those artisans exposed to irritating dust, probably miners take the\r\nsecond place after the miserable dry grinders. If we investigate the\r\ncondition of these men, we are immediately struck with the lamentable\r\nconditions under which they labour, and astonished at the endurance and\r\npatience with which they submit to toil to which that of the well-fed,\r\nwell-housed felon is pleasant pastime. There are at present upwards of\r\n300,000 human beings acting the part of gnomes for the good of the\r\ncommunity at large, entering day by day into the bowels of the earth, and\r\nemerging in the evening. Of human life they see as little as the train of\r\nblack ants we watch emerging from their holes in the ground. Yet the miner\r\nis the industrial Atlas of England. Were he to cease to labour, this busy\r\nhive of men would speedily be hushed, and the giant limbs of machinery,\r\nwhich now do the drudgery of the world, become as still as the enchanted\r\ngarden of the fairy tale ere the advent of the prince. Without the coal\r\nand the iron, the copper and the tin, they toilfully evolve from vast\r\ndepths, England would be but a third-rate power. A life so cheerless, and\r\nyet so useful--nay, essential, to our national existence--should at least\r\nreceive at the hands of the Government every protection that can be thrown\r\naround it; yet, if we follow the miner into his gallery and working cell,\r\nwe are amazed at the dangers and the difficulties which are needlessly\r\nthrust upon him in the black realm in which he moves and has his being.\r\nLet us take the collier, for example. In many pits in the West of England,\r\nthe seams of coal are not more than twenty or twenty-five inches thick;\r\nand inasmuch as the object of the worker is to remove the coal with as\r\nlittle as possible of the surrounding soil, he often drives his working\r\nto a considerable distance through an aperture not more than, and often\r\nnot so much as, two feet high. If our adult male reader will condescend to\r\nsquat himself on the floor, _à la Turque_, say under the dining-table, for\r\ninstance, and then picture to himself the inconvenience of picking with an\r\naxe the under side of the prandial mahogany for twelve hours, he will\r\nobtain some slight idea of the muscular knot into which the poor collier\r\nhas to tie himself, for the whole term of his working life, having to use\r\nviolent exercise throughout. Can it be wondered at that, under such\r\ncircumstances, the Apollo-like form of man becomes permanently twisted and\r\nbent, like the gnarled root of an oak that has been doubled up in the\r\nfissure of some rock? If we look at a collier, we see instantly that his\r\nback is curved, his legs bowed, and the extensor muscles of his calves\r\nwithered through long disease. He has knotted himself so long, that the\r\nerect position of his race becomes a punishment to him. It is credibly\r\nrelated that a number of colliers, having been sentenced to imprisonment\r\nin Wakefield jail, with hard labour, the only complaint they made was,\r\nthat they were obliged, whilst at work, to keep the ordinary posture of\r\nrational creatures. But confined space is only one of the many evil\r\nconditions under which they labour. In the majority of cases the collier\r\nworks in foul air; for, notwithstanding all the official inspection, the\r\nventilation of mines is still execrable. The fire-damp either blasts him\r\ninto a cinder, or the choke-damp noiselessly blots out his life. However\r\ngood, moreover, the general system of ventilation in a mine, unforeseen\r\naccidents will happen at any moment. The pick of the collier strikes into\r\nthe gallery of an old pit, where carbonic acid gas has been gathering\r\nperhaps for a century; and the poisoned air rushes in and does its work in\r\nan instant; or a sudden invasion of carburetted hydrogen, disengaged by\r\nthe fall of a mass of coal, meets the miner, who is working, perhaps\r\nimprudently, with a naked candle;--and an explosion follows which crowds\r\nthe pit's mouth with a wailing multitude of newly-made widows and orphans.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 1,500 lives are annually lost, principally through these\r\ncauses, and not less than 10,000 accidents in the same period testify to\r\nthe dangerous nature of the miner's occupation, notwithstanding the strict\r\nGovernment inspection.[50] It is humiliating to know that England is yet\r\nfar behind continental nations in her methods of preventing these dreadful\r\ncatastrophes. Mr. Mackworth, in his lecture at the Society of Arts, stated\r\nthat the mortality from accidents was, in the coal mines of\r\n\r\n                      Killed   Persons.\r\n  Prussia              1·89 per 1000 per annum.\r\n  Belgium              2·8       \"\r\n  England              4·5       \"\r\n  Staffordshire        7·3       \"\r\n\r\nThis comparison, so humiliating to England, cannot be explained by the\r\nsuperior adventure of our countrymen, inasmuch as the production of coal\r\nin Belgium is half as much again per acre of the coal-field as in England.\r\nIt is not, however, to the dramatic accidents of coal mines which every\r\nnow and then startle the community, to which we wish to draw attention;\r\nbut rather to the silent progress of disease, which makes his death so\r\npremature, and his life so miserable. In addition to his cramped\r\ncondition, whilst at work, his supply of oxygen is small; for in all\r\nprobability the air supplied to him has to circulate many miles through\r\nthe mine, and to pass over the excrementitious deposits of man and horse,\r\nand the decaying woodwork of the mine, ere it finally reaches him, in\r\nenfeebled streams, in his solitary working cell. Long deprivation of solar\r\nlight, again, tends to impoverish his blood, to blanch him, in short, like\r\nvegetable products similarly deprived of the light of day. It is through\r\nthe lungs, however, that the health of the miner is principally attacked.\r\nThe air of a coal mine (such as it is) holds a vast amount of coal-dust in\r\nmechanical suspension, and this, as a matter of course, is constantly\r\npassing into the lungs of the miner. The proof of this is the so-called\r\n\"black spit\" of the collier, which, on being subjected to the microscope,\r\nis found to consist of mucus, filled with finely divided particles of\r\ncoal. The permanent inhalation of such an atmosphere results in what is\r\ntermed the \"black lung.\" The breathing apparatus of the collier becomes\r\nclogged, in short, with coal-dust, and after death it has the appearance\r\nof being dipped in ink. A writer,[51] who has lately investigated this\r\nsingular pathological condition, thus gives his experience of two\r\n_post-mortem_ examinations:--\r\n\r\n    \"In each case, the black treacly fluid obtained by thus cutting the\r\n    various portions of the lung (more especially the posterior and\r\n    inferior portions of the lower lobes), and by slitting up the\r\n    bronchial tubes, was evaporated to dryness, and the residuum being\r\n    broken up and subjected to a red heat in a porcelain tube retort,\r\n    behaved precisely as coal under similar circumstances, _i.e._ it\r\n    evolved a smoke-like gaseous product, which, on being slightly\r\n    condensed, deposited hydro-sulphide of ammonium and coal tar, and\r\n    being thus purified, burnt in all respects like the well-known\r\n    compounds of the two carbides of hydrogen (common gas).\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gregory, of Edinburgh, many years since, by destructive analysis, came\r\nto the same conclusion respecting the carbonaceous nature of this deposit.\r\nThe presence of this foreign body in the lungs leads to the whole train of\r\npulmonary diseases. Asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia are but too\r\nfrequent, and we are consequently not surprised to hear that the aggregate\r\namount of sickness experienced by this class, for the period of life from\r\ntwenty to sixty, is 95 weeks, or 67 per cent, more than the general\r\naverage.\r\n\r\nRheumatism, leading to heart disease, is another very common complaint of\r\nthe miner. Indeed, all the conditions of ill-managed mines seem ready\r\nprepared for the propagation of this disease. When mines are driven to any\r\nconsiderable depth, the temperature proportionably increases, and 80\r\ndegrees of Fahrenheit is a common temperature at the end of workings, all\r\nthe year round. After exposure to this oppressive atmosphere during the\r\nwhole day, the collier perhaps suddenly emerges into the open air at the\r\npit's mouth, vitally depressed by his prolonged exertion, when the bitter\r\nwind is shaving the surface of the earth at a temperature much below\r\nfreezing point. In the coal-field stretching from Valenciennes to\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, the mines are made conspicuous a long way off by the\r\npresence of huge buildings, which enclose the machinery and the top of\r\nthe pit. In these buildings apartments are prepared in which the colliers\r\nchange their clothes before and after labour, and wash themselves in baths\r\nfilled with hot water from the steam waste-pipe. The importance of this\r\nsanitary precaution is very great, inasmuch as colliers, like\r\nchimney-sweeps, are subject to a skin disease, in consequence of the\r\nbegrimed condition of their skins. Lady Bassett has established these\r\nbaths, we understand, at her mines at Camborne, in Cornwall; but we think\r\nthat the enforcement of a sanitary act of such importance should not be\r\nleft to the philanthropic tendencies of individuals, but should be\r\nrequired by the Government. If a provision of this kind were made\r\ncompulsory, and stricter legislation with respect to ventilating mines\r\nwere established, no doubt a vast amount of disease could be eliminated.\r\nIt is estimated that the worst coal mines can be ventilated thoroughly at\r\na cost of one penny per man per day, and that in well-constructed furnaces\r\nthe consumption of one ton of coals per day at the bottom of an up-cast\r\nshaft will enable each collier to cut one ton of coals more per day with\r\nthe same amount of exertion. Such being the case, there can be no excuse\r\nfor asphyxiating the miners wholesale. Those proprietors of mines, who are\r\nonly open to these breeches-pocket appeals, should know that it is their\r\ninterest, in a pecuniary sense, to ventilate well, inasmuch as the\r\npreservative effect of pure air upon the wood brattrices, which form so\r\nexpensive an item in mining, effects a saving of 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nOur remarks hitherto have been directed entirely to coal mines and\r\ncolliers, as these are by far the most extensive industrial occupations of\r\nthe kind. The metalliferous mines, such as the tin and copper mines of\r\nCornwall, and lead mines of Derbyshire, are in pretty much the same\r\npestiferous condition, but in one particular they are still more\r\ndestructive of life than coal mines. In the latter the tired workman is\r\nlifted from the depths of the mines to the surface by a rope. The Cornwall\r\nminer, on the other hand, has to carry his exhausted body in some cases\r\nthousands of feet up a series of steep ladders to the mouth of the mine.\r\nIt has been estimated that many miners have thus to make an exertion\r\nevery night equal to climbing to the summit of Cader Idris, and this in an\r\nup-cast shaft used for the extraction of the foul air! The disastrous\r\neffect upon the already weary miner has long been known, yet in only a few\r\nof the great mines of Cornwall has the tireless arm of the steam-engine\r\nbeen called in to save him from this unnecessary labour. The machinery\r\nused is called a man-machine, and differs entirely from that employed in\r\ncoal-pits. In place of a rope, a beam of wood or iron descends through the\r\nwhole length of the shaft; this beam, at regular intervals of ten feet,\r\nhas little platforms attached to it, sufficient to afford standing-room to\r\na miner; at the sides of the shaft are similar platforms, at the same\r\nintervals. At every stroke of the engine the beam ascends or descends\r\nthrough the space of ten feet, consequently the miner has only to step\r\nfrom the fixed platform to the moving one to be lifted ten feet every time\r\nit ascends. In this manner as many as a hundred men are lifted at the same\r\ntime several thousand feet in a few minutes, without any more exertion\r\nthan is necessary to make a few score steps. This curious invention has\r\nmaterially benefited the miner, and where it is used there is a manifest\r\nabsence of the heart disease, induced by the climbing of interminable\r\nladders placed in an almost vertical position.\r\n\r\nDr. Greenhow, in his report on the prevalence of certain diseases in\r\ndifferent districts of England and Wales, very clearly proves the\r\ndeleterious nature of the lead-miner's employment by the comparisons he\r\nmakes between the death-rates of the men and women of Reeth and Alston,\r\nwhich are purely lead-mining districts. In the former, the lead-miners die\r\nat the rate of 2,037 per 100,000 of all ages, whilst their wives, sisters,\r\nand daughters, who are variously employed, die at the reduced rate of\r\n1,711 per 100,000; in other words, lead-mining in this one typical\r\ndistrict caused an excess of no less than 3·26 deaths in every 100,000\r\ninhabitants; and if we make a comparison relative to the prevalence of\r\npulmonary disease between the two sexes, above the age of twenty, we find\r\nthe death-rate of the men is double that of the women. The evil influence\r\nof copper-mining on the male population is not quite so marked, but still\r\nit is apparent enough. Thus, in Redruth, in which this kind of labour is\r\nexclusively carried on, we find that in every 100,000 of population, 220\r\nmales die from pulmonary disease more than females; and in Penzance, which\r\nis exclusively a tin-mining district, the superior waste of male over\r\nfemale life, in the same population, of all ages, is 104.\r\n\r\nThe mason, like the miner, is particularly liable to suffer from the\r\npresence of irritating substances in the lungs. It has been asserted that\r\nin Edinburgh members of the craft rarely live more than fifty years. This\r\nis doubtless owing to the nature of the material they work upon. There is\r\ngreat reason to suppose that the degree of damage done to the delicate\r\nair-cells of the lung is to be measured by the nature of the particles\r\ninhaled. Thus, the ragged portions of granite detached by the chisel are\r\nmuch more likely to do harm than the less irregular dust of the\r\nbricklayer. In this manner we can account for the high rate of mortality\r\nsaid to exist among the masons of our northern metropolis. The scourers in\r\nthe potteries exercise their fearful trade in an atmosphere loaded with\r\npulverised flints, a mineral dust of the most distressing character: we\r\nare not surprised, therefore, to hear that in this process pulmonary\r\ndisease is still more rampant than among the Edinburgh masons, and is\r\nlittle inferior to that of the dry grinders of Sheffield, who receive into\r\ntheir lungs jagged particles of steel as well as grindstone dust.[52] It\r\nwill be unnecessary to consider all the trades which are affected by\r\ndust, inasmuch as the artisans employed in them are similarly subjected to\r\npulmonary affections, if not in a like degree. Thus millers are rendered\r\nconsumptive and asthmatic by the floating meal of their mills;\r\nsnuff-makers by the snuff which pervades the air of their places of work;\r\npearl-button-makers suffer still more from the same cause; and the men of\r\nSheffield who haft knives with cocoa-wood or ebony are affected with a\r\ndisease exactly like the hay-asthma. The shoddy-grinders of the West\r\nRiding, who grind and break up rags in a machine called \"a devil,\" are\r\nsubjected to what they term the shoddy fever, in consequence of the\r\ndevil's dust given off in the tearing process. The dressers and preparers\r\nof hair, especially of foreign hair, are speedily broken in health by the\r\ndust and stench produced by their operations.\r\n\r\nThe evil effects arising from the prosecution of these trades sink into\r\ninsignificance, however, when compared with the destruction caused by the\r\nfloating fluff of flax-mills. These mills employ children of tender years,\r\nwho have to work in an atmosphere loaded with vegetable particles to such\r\na degree, that in a measure it clouds the vision. The hecklers are the\r\nchief sufferers in this department of industry, especially the children,\r\nwho are, many of them, forced to work the same time as adults--that is, as\r\nlong as human nature can possibly hold out. We shall have more to say,\r\nhowever, when we come to consider the effects of bleaching and dyeing\r\nworks, respecting those trades which exhaust the youthful powers of large\r\nportions of the working population, and thus do infinitely more damage to\r\nthe race than the more curious diseases of smaller trades, which may be\r\nsevere enough, but do not affect more than infinitesimal portions of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIt would be supposed that workers on decomposing vegetable and animal\r\nmatter would suffer a sickness and mortality only inferior to the artisans\r\nsubjected to the emanations of poisonous metals. _A priori_, we should\r\nsay, for instance, that dustmen, night men, and the workers in sewers,\r\nwould be amongst the most unhealthy of the working classes, and, indeed,\r\nroutine sanitarians would summarily tell us that such must be the case.\r\nThe begrimed and dusty scavenger, whose very name is a reproach, spends\r\nthe best part of his life in clearing away the disgusting refuse of\r\ncivilization; he has yet another duty to perform which brings him into\r\nstill closer contact with unsavoury emanations. The lay-stall, or\r\nscavengers' yard, is of course a huge collection of the sweepings of the\r\nstreets, the refuse of the markets, and the night-soil and dust of the\r\nhouses, but it is not allowed to remain in a fermenting and indiscriminate\r\nmass. Almost as soon as it is deposited, men, women, and boys are employed\r\nto sift and sort the heap; bones, glass, woollen and linen rags, old iron\r\nand other metals, have to be eliminated from the mass and set aside, and\r\nthe coals and great cinders are extracted from the useless ashes by the\r\n\"hill-men.\" It would scarcely be possible to bring human life into closer\r\ncontact with filth of every kind than we find it to be in the workers in\r\nthese lay-stalls. Yet, strange to say, Dr. Guy, who has investigated their\r\nsanitary condition, finds them to be among the healthiest of our working\r\npopulation. \"They are, with a very few exceptions,\" he tells us, \"a\r\nhealthy-looking, ruddy-complexioned race;\" that is, they wear their\r\nnatural rouge under their artificial tint, reversing the more fashionable\r\nmethod of May Fair.\r\n\r\n\"One or two boys,\" he tells us, \"whom I saw at work, would have been\r\nexcellent models for the artist.\" Our London readers will perhaps remember\r\nto have seen troops of robust and rosy-looking young women, not perhaps in\r\nafternoon toilet, making their way, about five o'clock, from the Marble\r\nArch across Hyde Park; these are the \"hill-women,\" chiefly Irish, trooping\r\nhome to the rookeries of Westminster; their appearance quite confirms Dr.\r\nGuy's views as to the healthful appearance of these workers. The master\r\nscavengers, who live with all their families amid these heaps of dusty\r\ndesolation, excite the admiration of this searcher after truth still more;\r\nand at last, breaking out of the calm unimpassioned manner which the\r\nphilosophical statist, who deals only with general truths, is wont to\r\nimpose upon himself, he thus fairly gives vent to his admiration for the\r\ngenus dustman:--\r\n\r\n    \"To conclude this account of the health of this very useful class of\r\n    men, I will merely add that the score or so of master scavengers who\r\n    were brought together on more than one occasion by the trial already\r\n    alluded to (an indictment for nuisance against a lay-stall keeper), as\r\n    the origin of these inquiries, _are the healthiest set of men I have\r\n    ever seen_. I do not think, whether in town or country, such a body of\r\n    men could be brought together, except by selection; and it is not\r\n    going too far to assert of them, that if the comparison were limited\r\n    to the inhabitants of London, or our large towns, no score of selected\r\n    tradesmen could be found to match the same number of scavengers\r\n    brought casually together.\"\r\n\r\nThis is high praise, and doubtless deserved; but few people, however,\r\nwould have suspected that Hygeia clasped so closely to her bosom the grimy\r\nscavenger in his filthy frock. Dr. Guy, however, gives us hard figures for\r\nhis pleasant flourishes. If we compare the scavenger with other workmen\r\nplaced under somewhat similar circumstances, he rises triumphant over\r\nthem. Thus whilst the bricklayer's labourer, generally a very poor\r\nIrishman, it is true, suffers from fever, a ratio of 35-1/2 per cent., and\r\nthe brickmaker 21 per cent., the scavenger experiences only 8 per cent. of\r\nillness from the same cause. This result does seem astonishing when we\r\nremember that sanitarians sometimes attribute so much illness to the\r\npresence of a neglected dust-heap; but as Dr. Guy very justly remarks,\r\nthose emanations which may prove injurious when confined within a small\r\nspace--and our houses, like bell glasses, cover and keep in numberless\r\nimpurities--become innoxious when fully exposed to the air. We suspect,\r\nhowever, that the power of ashes to absorb noxious emanations of all\r\nkinds, is at the bottom of the striking immunity which the scavenger\r\nexhibits from all febrile complaints. Nightmen and sewer-men, again, are\r\nbrought into direct communication with the most disgusting, and as the\r\npublic are led to suppose, the most poisonous animal effluvia; they stir\r\nin the very nidus of fever, yet it has been remarked by many observers\r\nthat they are singularly exempt from this disease. Sir Anthony Carlisle\r\ntells us that out of fifty men employed in the sewers in his time, only\r\nthree had had fever. Thakrah declares that out of eighteen examined by his\r\nassistant, only two had even slight disorders, and they informed him that\r\nappetite was increased by the effluvia; and finally Dr. Guy tells us that\r\nout of thirty-four nightmen examined by him, only one had had an attack of\r\nfever, and he only through being out of work for three weeks; he suffered,\r\nin short, _from change of air_, and perhaps want of food. Dr. Guy, in the\r\nlittle pamphlet we have already quoted from, states a most remarkable\r\nfact, illustrative of the changes of opinion, even amongst medical men,\r\nrelative to the effects of snuffing sewer emanations. He says, that a\r\ngentleman who accompanied him in one of his inspections over a scavenger's\r\nyard, informed him that, \"he perfectly well recollects thirty years ago,\r\nwhen he was a lad, seeing as many as twelve patients directed by the\r\nfaculty of that day _to walk round the shoots_ for the night-soil on his\r\nfather's premises; and he appealed for confirmation of this statement to\r\nhis brother, who said that he had seen scores of patients industriously\r\ninhaling this curious dose of physic.\" Thakrah, who wrote his celebrated\r\n\"Treatise on the Effects of Trades and Professions on Health,\" about this\r\nperiod, tells us that the parents of consumptive youth, in his time,\r\nbrought them up to the business of a butcher, in the hope of averting that\r\nformidable malady. In endeavouring to avoid Scylla, they fell into\r\nCharybdis, inasmuch as it is a well-ascertained fact that butchers,\r\nalthough exempt from consumption and scrofula, are very prone to\r\ninflammatory diseases. They are seldom ill, but when ill, it goes hard\r\nwith them,--so much so, that, as a class, these jolly, red-faced men, the\r\nvery pictures of their own beef, are but short-lived. The effects of\r\nanimal emanations, and the contact of animal substances with the skin in\r\nprotecting workmen from consumption, is a very remarkable circumstance.\r\nTanners constantly at work among tan-pits, are rarely, we believe,\r\nattacked with phthisis; and those artisans in the woollen-manufacture\r\ntermed cloth-piecers, whose skins are smeared with oil in the course of\r\nthe day, present a remarkable contrast to the workers in cotton\r\nfactories,--their flesh being plump and rosy, and their muscles strong.\r\nMr. Thompson of Perth, who has investigated this subject, found the weight\r\nof one hundred young persons, so employed, increased in three months 575\r\nlbs., giving an average increase of 5-3/4 lbs., and in eight selected\r\ncases the gain during the same brief period averaged no less than 17 lbs.\r\neach person. The beneficial effect of this department of the\r\nwoollen-manufacture is so well known, that in Yorkshire the better classes\r\nfrequently send the delicate members of their families to the\r\nwoollen-mills for the benefit of their health. The application of oil,\r\nespecially of cod-liver oil, to the skin, has indeed been recommended to\r\nconsumptive patients, as thereby a greater amount of carbonaceous material\r\ncan be thrown into the system without deranging it than by any other.\r\nAfter having drawn attention to so many occupations which are positively\r\ninjurious to artisans, it is at least gratifying to be able to point to\r\none large and rapidly-increasing manufacture which is so clearly\r\nbeneficial in its operations upon human health.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of artisans which suffers from the inhalation of\r\npoisonous matters into the lungs, like the grinders and the masons, &c.,\r\nbut the foreign matter here presents itself in the form of a subtle\r\nvapour, rather than in that of dust. We little think, when we strike a\r\nlucifer-match,--that incomparable product of civilization, whose inventor\r\ndeserves a statue in every capital in Europe,--what suffering it may\r\npossibly have caused in its manufacture. The composition at the end of a\r\nmatch is composed of phosphorus combined with oxymuriate of potash and\r\nglue, made into a paste, and kept liquid by being placed over a heated\r\nmetal plate. Into this composition the \"dipper\" dips the bundle of\r\nmatches, and in doing so he is forced to inhale the vapour given off,\r\nwhich is strongly charged with phosphoric acid, the effect of which upon\r\nhim is sometimes most disastrous. After a time he experiences most\r\nexcruciating pains in the bones of the jaw, but principally in the lower\r\none; they begin to swell, a purulent discharge takes place, and, finally,\r\nthe bone dies and comes away. Mr. Stanley, one of the surgeons of St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital, had a patient who thus lost the whole of the lower\r\njaw. There appears to be considerable doubt whether the poison acts\r\nlocally or constitutionally. One would naturally suppose that if the\r\naction were local, it would first take effect upon the bones of the nose,\r\nbut, as far as the experience of surgery goes, the \"dipper\" always\r\npreserves his nose intact. That the poisonous fumes have a certain\r\nconstitutional effect, the aspect of the workman at once declares;\r\ncadaverous in complexion, emaciated to a degree, and painfully nervous, he\r\npresents the appearance of a person suffering from the presence of some\r\nirritant poison in the blood. It certainly is very remarkable that\r\nphosphorus, which, in the form of phosphate of lime, is a very important\r\nconstituent of bone, should have such an extraordinary effect upon it when\r\nreceived into the system in the manner we have described. We are not aware\r\nthat this drug, when received into the stomach only, has ever produced the\r\nlocal effect noticed; but, without doubt, it is the quantity of the\r\npoisonous agent to which the workman is subjected, as he not only receives\r\nthe fumes directly into his mouth and air-passages in the act of\r\n\"dipping,\" but the whole atmosphere of the factory becomes so impregnated\r\nwith phosphorus, in consequence of its volatilization when the process of\r\ndrying the matches is being proceeded with, that his clothes even become\r\nsaturated to such an extent that in the dark they appear quite luminous.\r\nIn Vienna, where enormous numbers of lucifer-matches are made, necrosis of\r\nthe jaw is of common occurrence among the workmen; and the German\r\nphysicians believe that the disease arises principally in persons of\r\nscrofulous habit, the periosteum or lining membrane of whose bones are\r\npeculiarly liable to take on inflammatory action, the death of the bone\r\nfollowing as a matter of course. If this view of the case be true, all\r\nscrofulous persons should be warned from the employment, as dangerous, and\r\nin all cases employers should adopt every precaution in their power to\r\nprevent the recurrence of such mischief to the employed. Mr. Stanley says\r\nthat the oil of turpentine, which is a solvent of phosphorous, when\r\nexposed in saucers, absorbs the vapour which does so much mischief, and\r\nthat its employment in a large lucifer-match factory in the neighbourhood\r\nof the London Hospital was attended with the happiest success. Thus we\r\nhave another example of the power of the chemist to make the good elements\r\nof his craft do battle with the evil ones in the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\nAnother and more common instance, in which the workman is sacrificed to\r\nluxury, is the case of the water-gilder. The skill of this artisan is\r\nemployed in gilding metals, principally silver, by the action of fire. The\r\nmetal to be gilded is coated with an amalgam of gold and mercury, and is\r\nthen exposed to the fumes of a charcoal fire, which drives off the\r\nmercury, and leaves the gold adherent to the metal. During the process the\r\nfumes of the mercury are inhaled by the workman, and, indeed, deposit\r\ntheir metalliferous particles over the entire surface of the skin. The\r\nresult is, that he speedily becomes afflicted with mercurial tremor, or,\r\nin the language of the workshop, he gets \"a fit of the trembles.\" If he\r\nproceeds with his work the tremor rapidly increases. Dr. Watson, in\r\ndescribing a patient thus afflicted, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"He was led into the room, walking with uncertain steps, his limbs\r\n    trembling and dancing, as though he had been hung on wires. While\r\n    sitting on a chair he was comparatively quiet,--you would not suppose\r\n    that he ailed anything; but, as soon as he attempted to rise and to\r\n    walk, his legs began to shake violently with a rapid movement. He\r\n    could neither hold them steadily nor direct them with precision.\"\r\n\r\nWere it not painful to contemplate, the incoherent muscular action of\r\nworkmen thus afflicted would appear ludicrous. In endeavouring to put his\r\nfood into his mouth he will sometimes, as in chorea, bob it against his\r\neye or his cheek; and extreme cases have been known in which the\r\nunfortunate water-gilder thus afflicted has been forced to take his food\r\nlike a quadruped. As the disease increases, the complexion becomes of a\r\nbrown hue, and presently delirium, and, lastly, want of consciousness\r\nsupervenes. To this complexion comes the water-gilder; and as the silverer\r\nof looking-glasses is exposed to the action of mercury, both by touch and\r\ninhalation, the same effects are produced upon him. If the charming belle,\r\nas she surveys her beauty in the glass, could but for a moment see\r\nreflected this poor shattered human creature, with trembling muscles,\r\nbrown visage, and blackened teeth, she would doubtless start with horror;\r\nbut, as it is, the slaves of luxury and vanity drop out of life unobserved\r\nand uncared for, as the stream of travellers disappeared one by one\r\nthrough the bridge of Mirza. Happily, the subtle finger of electricity has\r\nin a measure emancipated the water-gilder from the horrors of his art. The\r\nvoltaic battery now deposits the metal without the intervention of\r\nquicksilver, and science has eliminated another of those destructive\r\nagencies which have hitherto afflicted this class of artisans.\r\n\r\nThe silvering of mirrors and looking-glasses still remains a dangerous\r\noperation; but there can be no doubt that with properly-constructed flues\r\nthe floating metal would be entirely conducted away. Indeed, it is by the\r\nchimney that much of the metal now escapes; for Thakrah tells us that he\r\nhas been informed by a manufacturer that from the sweepings of the chimney\r\non one occasion he had collected twenty pounds of good quicksilver.\r\nAnother, and a very manageable expedient, sometimes resorted to by those\r\nexposed to the fumes and the oxide of mercury, is to cover the mouth with\r\na tube-like proboscis, which hangs out of the way of the floating metal,\r\nand thus conducts pure air to the operator.\r\n\r\nThakrah tells us that workers in brass also suffer from the inhalation of\r\nthe volatilized metal. The brass-melters of Birmingham suffer from\r\nintermittent fever, which they call the brass ague. This malady leaves\r\nthem in a state of great debility. The filers of brass, on the same\r\nauthority, are subject to a most peculiar affection, like Tittlebat\r\nTitmouse, their hair turning a vivid green. It is supposed that the copper\r\nin the brass-dust combines with the oil of the hair, and thus an oxide of\r\ncopper is formed. Coppersmiths are, of course, similarly affected.\r\nPlumbers, whilst casting, are subject to the volatilized oxide of lead,\r\nwhich in time produces paralysis; and while they are soldering, many\r\ndeleterious fumes arise, of a sweetish taste, and of a highly astringent\r\nnature, which often produces violent attacks of constipation.\r\n\r\nBut poisonous metals may attack the mucous membrane in the shape of\r\nfinely-divided powder used in the arts. There is an exceedingly beautiful\r\npaper, of an apple-green colour, which is often selected for the coolness\r\nand cheerfulness of its appearance. The writer was himself once deluded by\r\nthe seductive appearance of a paper of this description, and had his\r\nlibrary furnished with it. Strange to say, a violent cold seemed to seize\r\nevery one, even in the midst of summer, who stopped long in this\r\napartment, especially if they came much in contact with the walls. On\r\nquestioning the paper-hanger the mystery was speedily explained. \"I never\r\nhang that kind of paper,\" he said, \"without getting a bad sore throat and\r\na running of the eyes. All the trade knows it is good for a cold to have\r\nany dealings with it.\" The cheerful green of the paper is nothing less\r\ndeadly than the aceto-arsenite of copper, an irritant poison of the first\r\nclass. The flock part of the paper contains a large quantity of pigment in\r\nthe form of dust, which is of course liable to be detached from the walls\r\non very slight occasions. It has been erroneously supposed that the metal\r\nmust be volatilized by heat ere it can be separated from the paper; but\r\nthe action of detachment is mechanical, and not chemical; the poisonous\r\ndust either falls or is brushed off the wall, and becomes mixed with the\r\nordinary dust of the room; the lifting of a book, or the displacement of a\r\npile of papers, proves sufficient to set these particles in motion, and to\r\nbring them in contact with the mucous linings of the eyes, nose, and\r\nthroat; hence the violent irritation produced, which similates so closely\r\nthe effects of a bad cold in the head. Professor Taylor, the celebrated\r\nmedical toxocologist, has moreover proved the presence of arsenic in the\r\ndust fallen from this kind of paper. In a letter to the _Medical Times and\r\nGazette_, of January 1st, 1859, he says,--\r\n\r\n    \"I procured from the shop of Messrs. Marratt and Short, opticians, 68,\r\n    King William Street, London Bridge, a quantity of dust for the purpose\r\n    of analysis. The walls of this shop are covered with an unglazed\r\n    arsenical paper, and, as I am informed, they have been so covered for\r\n    a period of about three years. In collecting this dust from the tops\r\n    of the cases containing the instruments, great care was taken not to\r\n    touch the walls. The quantity thus collected for examination amounted\r\n    to about 450 grains. It was nearly black, and, under the microscope,\r\n    appeared to consist of fibres of sooty particles. It was very light\r\n    and flocculent. One hundred and fifty grains of the dust were examined\r\n    by Reinsch's process, and enough metallic arsenic was obtained from it\r\n    to coat about ten square inches of copper foil, in addition to a piece\r\n    of copper gauze. From the latter deposit, by the application of heat,\r\n    octahedral crystals of arsenic were readily obtained. The case had not\r\n    been dusted for a period of nine months. Even the dust of instruments\r\n    locked up in the cases, which were lined at the back only with the\r\n    green paper, was found to be charged with this poisonous pigment. Half\r\n    a grain of the dust sufficed to cover pretty thickly with metallic\r\n    arsenic a square inch of copper gauze. These facts,\" says Professor\r\n    Taylor, \"lead to the inevitable inference that the air of a room, of\r\n    which the walls are covered with an unglazed arsenical green paper, is\r\n    liable to be charged with the fine dust of the poisonous\r\n    aceto-arsenite of copper. Those who inhabit these rooms are exposed to\r\n    breathe the dust. The poison may thus find its way by the pulmonary\r\n    membrane into the system, or it may affect the eyes, nose, and throat\r\n    by local action.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this unimpeachable testimony to the poisonous character of the\r\npigment in this paper, it is not difficult to understand that the workmen\r\nemployed in its manufacture are particularly liable to attacks of illness\r\nwhich exhibit all the symptoms of acute influenza; or that the\r\npaper-hangers, in putting it up, are sometimes obliged to leave work for a\r\ntime, in order to get rid of the distressing symptoms to which its\r\nmanipulation gives rise.\r\n\r\nThere is in Sheffield an occupation connected with tool-making which\r\nforms, as it were, a connecting link between the diseases produced by\r\nworking in steel and those which flow from working in lead: we allude to\r\nfile-making. Unfortunately, the various preparations of lead enter very\r\nlargely into the arts and manufactures of this country; and as its action\r\nupon the human body is very great, its pernicious influence is felt in a\r\nvast number of occupations of a diverse nature. Thus, white-lead\r\nmanufacturers, sheet-lead rollers, painters, plumbers, potters, china\r\nmanufacturers, colour-grinders, glaziers, enamellers of cards,\r\nlead-miners, and shot-makers, all come under the saturnine influence; even\r\nthe poor lacemakers of Belgium do not escape, for the manufacturer, in\r\norder to make the fibre look white, requires them to dust it with\r\nwhite-lead powder, and possibly, by this means, it may find its way into\r\nthe fair skin of a duchess!\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that a worker in steel should suffer from the poison\r\nof lead, but it occurs in this manner:--The file-maker, in order to hold\r\nthe file securely, and, at the same time, to protect the fine edge of the\r\nsharp chisel with which he cuts the face of the file, places it upon a bed\r\nof lead which rests upon an anvil. In cutting the larger three-square\r\nfiles, the workman uses as much as a pound of lead a week; this is\r\ndetached from the mass by friction and the use of the chisel, in the form\r\nof a fine black powder. It is curious that the first portion of the\r\nfile-cutter's anatomy that is affected is the finger that rests upon the\r\nlead; at first it feels numb, and then becomes paralyzed. If the artisan\r\nwill not take warning by this fastidious touch of a digit, before long the\r\npoison grips him by the wrist, and then some fine morning he wakes and\r\nfinds that he has what is termed in the trade \"a dropped hand;\"[53] that\r\nis, the extensor muscles of the wrist are paralyzed, and the hand falls\r\nhelplessly forward, like the fore-paw of a kangaroo. Here the specific\r\naction of the poison has exerted itself through the skin of the part\r\naffected. The same thing is observable in painters, who are more subject\r\nto lead-paralysis than perhaps any other workers in lead. The finger which\r\nfirst touches the brush first suffers; and the potter, who has in the\r\ncourse of his trade to dip his ware in a preparation of lead and flints in\r\norder to form the glaze, is in like manner, but still more severely,\r\nafflicted. It is well ascertained, however, that the constitutional\r\neffects which show themselves in obstinate constipation and cholic, arise\r\nfrom the reception of the lead directly into the mouth, either in the\r\nshape of finely-divided particles, or floating in the air, or direct from\r\nthe fingers to the manipulators: thus, painters will eat their food with\r\nfingers soiled with the brush. The mere exhalations of paint are\r\nsufficient to paralyze some constitutions very speedily; a single night\r\nspent in a newly-painted house is sufficient to produce cholic,\r\nespecially in young children. And Dr. Watson, in his \"Practice of Physic,\"\r\nrelates a case in which a person suffered from dropped hands who had, she\r\nsaid, no concern with lead in any way: on cross-examining her, however, it\r\nat last came out that her sons \"had in the preceding summer occupied their\r\nleisure time with making birdcages and painting them green in the one room\r\nin which she habitually lived.\" The dippers, as they are termed in the\r\npotteries, are perhaps subjected to more frightful effects from\r\nlead-poisoning than any other workmen: in addition to paralysis and\r\ncholic, the subtle poison sometimes creeps into the brain, mania comes on,\r\nand they die raving mad. The grinding and packing of white lead is so\r\ndestructive, that the men can work at the occupation for a few hours in\r\nthe day only; the dust that is given off penetrates the clothes, and\r\ncovers the skin to such an extent that these artisans, after taking a\r\nmedicated bath of sulphuret of potassium in water, come out like\r\nblackamoors.\r\n\r\nIn these works rats and mice are speedily poisoned by the fine white-lead\r\ndust, which penetrates even to their holes. The artisan who handles lead\r\nin its various combinations may, however, vastly mitigate his trouble by\r\nadopting perfect cleanliness. Before every meal he should wash his hands\r\nthoroughly, and after work he should change his clothes. Medical science\r\nhas given him the means of being forewarned that lead is entering his\r\nsystem by a particular and rarely-failing diagnostic sign: where the metal\r\nhas entered the system a blue line will be discovered near the edge of the\r\ngums; when this blue Peter is hoisted he may know that danger is at hand,\r\nand that, unless he is more careful, his bread-earning hand will speedily\r\ndrop powerless by his side. In all cases, however, prevention is better\r\nthan cure; and we are glad to learn that almost perfect exemption from\r\npainter's cholic and paralysis has been secured in some extensive painting\r\nestablishments, by causing artisans to drink a lemonade made by adding a\r\ndrop of sulphuric acid to a gallon of water. The sulphuric acid is\r\nsupposed to form, with the lead received into the mouth and stomach, a\r\nsulphuret of that metal, which is insoluble, and, therefore, cannot be\r\ntaken up by the absorbents into the system.\r\n\r\nThere are many important classes of workers whose sufferings have nothing\r\neither curious or dramatic about them, who nevertheless furnish the\r\nlargest contingent to the army of death. At the head of these dismal\r\ncompanies march tailors, bakers, and milliners of large cities and towns.\r\nThese three classes supply more victims to what has been erroneously\r\ntermed \"the English death,\" or consumption, than any other. Yet there can\r\nbe no doubt that there is but one condition wanting to render these\r\nemployments comparatively speaking healthy, and that one want is pure air.\r\nDr. Arnot makes the monkeys in the Zoological Garden teach us a lesson in\r\nthis particular which should not be lost upon us. In his evidence before\r\nthe Health Commission he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"A new house was built to receive the monkeys, and no expense was\r\n    spared which, in the opinion of those intrusted with the management,\r\n    could ensure to those natives of a warm climate all attainable comfort\r\n    and safety. Unhappily, however, it was believed that the object would\r\n    be best secured by making the new room nearly what an English\r\n    gentleman's drawing-room is. For warming it, two ordinary drawing-room\r\n    grates were put in as close to the floor as possible, and with low\r\n    chimney openings, that the heated air in the room should not escape by\r\n    the chimneys, while the windows and other openings in the walls above\r\n    were made as close as possible. Some additional warm air was admitted\r\n    through the openings in the floor, from hot-water pipes placed beneath\r\n    it. For ventilation in cold weather, openings were made in the\r\n    skirting of the room below the floor, with the erroneous idea that the\r\n    carbonic acid produced in the respiration of these animals, because\r\n    heavier than the other air in the room, would separate from this and\r\n    escape below. When all this was done, about sixty healthy monkeys,\r\n    many of which had already borne several winters in England, were put\r\n    into the room. A month afterwards more than fifty of them were dead,\r\n    and the few remaining ones were dying. This room, only open below, was\r\n    as truly an extinguisher to the living monkeys as an inverted coffee\r\n    cup held over and around the flame of a candle is an extinguisher of\r\n    the candle. Not only the warmth of the fires and the warm air that was\r\n    allowed to enter by the openings in the floor, but the hot breath and\r\n    all the impure exhalations from the bodies of the monkeys ascended,\r\n    first to the upper part of the room to be completely incorporated with\r\n    the atmosphere there, and by no possibility could escape except as a\r\n    part of that impure atmosphere, gradually passing away by the chimneys\r\n    and openings in the skirting. Therefore, from the time the monkeys\r\n    went into the room until they died, they could not have had a single\r\n    breath of fresh air.\"\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ examination proved that these monkeys all died of\r\nconsumption; so that we have a practical proof that this dread disease\r\ncan be brought on at will. Now, what took place in the monkey-house is\r\ntaking place, in a milder form, in the hundreds of workshops in which\r\ntailors and milliners work in this metropolis. In the great majority of\r\ncases tailors work together in rooms by no means proportioned to the\r\nnumber that occupies them. In many cases they work knee to knee on the\r\nshop-board with the thermometer ranging from 95 to 100 degrees, no\r\nventilation whatever being present, for when it is provided, the enfeebled\r\nworkers, fearing catarrhal complaints, stop them up. The result is, an\r\namount of consumption among them second only to that prevalent among the\r\ngrinders of Sheffield and bakers. The cross-legged fashion in which he\r\nworks in some measure assimilates him to the collier. It has been\r\nsuggested that instead of thus doubling himself up for the whole time of\r\nhis working life, he should work on a board having a hole in it of the\r\ncircumference of his body, with a seat fixed for his support beneath. Such\r\na contrivance would render his position easy, and enable him to bring his\r\nwork pretty close to his eyes without his having to bend over it as he\r\ndoes at present. As the tailor is principally employed on black and dark\r\nclothes, his eyes are much strained, especially if he works by gas-light:\r\nhence he is subject to great impairment of vision.\r\n\r\nThe baker is subjected to a still greater number of debilitating\r\ninfluences as regards his health than the tailor. In all cases his place\r\nof work is in a confined basement, where the oven and the gas contrive to\r\nkeep the temperature at a tropical point. There is generally a privy close\r\nat hand, and the drains are not always in good order; the air, already\r\nfoul enough, has yet to be contaminated with the floating flour-dust so\r\nirritating to the fine air-passages of the lungs. In an atmosphere thus\r\ndeliberately poisoned with the elements of sickness, the journeyman baker\r\nis confined ordinarily from seven o'clock at night until four the\r\nfollowing morning, and towards the end of the week he is engaged nearly\r\ntwo entire days in succession. Is it surprising that their rate of\r\nsickness is dreadful--greater than even that of the tailors? Dr. Guy tells\r\nus that no less than thirty-one in the hundred spit blood, and that every\r\nother journeyman of the low-priced bakers, who work under still worse\r\nconditions, is subjected to this most dangerous disease. We feel convinced\r\nthat the public cannot be aware that they eat their daily bread at the\r\nexpense of the life-blood of the producers. Parliament has refused to\r\ninterfere in their behalf, but Lord Shaftesbury has taken up their cause,\r\nand we believe that ere long the force of public opinion will lead to the\r\nabolition of the nightwork, which is at the bottom of the evil. At all\r\nevents, those who wish to assist in the emancipation of these slaves of\r\ncivilization, will see with pleasure the introduction of the aërated\r\nbread, which by the aid of machinery manufactures the loaf in a much more\r\ncleanly method than by hand-labour, and performs the whole process in less\r\nthan an hour. The introduction of machinery into this trade will at once\r\ncure the evils complained of, which result in the majority of cases from\r\nthe confined establishments and insufficient means of the master-bakers.\r\n\r\nThe milliners, especially of London, are nearly as unhealthy as the\r\ntailors. The evidence given before the Select Committee of the House of\r\nLords in 1855, to inquire into the expediency of passing a bill for the\r\nprotection of needlewomen, certainly is appalling in the tale it tells of\r\nthe waste of youthful life. During the season of four months, the shortest\r\ntime these poor young creatures work is from six in the morning until\r\ntwelve at night, and when they are very hard pressed for time they are\r\nobliged to take their meals standing. At times of great pressure young\r\ngirls have been worked four days and nights consecutively; and Lord Ashley\r\npublicly made mention at the meeting at Exeter Hall, July 11th, 1856, of a\r\nwitness who had worked without going to bed from four o'clock on Thursday\r\nafternoon until half-past ten on Sunday night. Such toil as this in close\r\nrooms reeking with human exhalations, and further deteriorated by the\r\nexcessive use of gas, is scarcely to be matched in deadliness by any\r\noccupation engaged in even by the stronger sex; and we are not surprised\r\nto hear that it is a frequent thing in fashionable millinery\r\nestablishments to find the workers faint from sheer exhaustion; as the\r\nQueen's physician emphatically says, \"a mode of life more completely\r\ncalculated to destroy human health could scarcely be contrived.\" Mr.\r\nWhite Cooper, the Queen's oculist, states, in his lately-published work on\r\nthe eyes, that he has generally observed a great increase of patients of\r\nthis class come to him after there has been a general mourning. The\r\ncommittee of the Society of Arts which some few years since made a report\r\non the industrial pathology of trades which affect the eyes, recommend\r\nthat the light should be thrown on the work rather than the eye; they also\r\nrecommend that the colour of the material upon which needlewomen are\r\nengaged should be changed as often as possible, upon the ground that to\r\npreserve the tone of the organ it should have variety of stimulus, its\r\nlong application to the same colour inevitably exhausting it. The\r\nfollowing suggestion from a traveller, which is embodied in this\r\ninteresting report, is worthy of notice:--\"Needlewomen, embroiderers, and\r\nlacemakers should work in rooms hung with green blinds and curtains to the\r\nwindows. When in North China, I became convinced of the very great\r\nadvantage with which this rule has been adopted by the exquisite\r\nembroiderers of that part. Their books of patterns are frequently called\r\n'Books of the Lady of the Green Window.'\" Among the diseases affecting\r\nfemale workers we must not omit to mention an affection called\r\n\"housemaid's knee,\" which is peculiar to those servants who kneel much\r\nupon hard wet stones or boards. The pressure on the knee gives rise to a\r\nvery painful inflammation of the bursa, or pad, which nature has\r\ninterposed between the skin and the patella, or knee-cap.\r\n\r\nShoemakers live a sedentary life, like tailors and milliners, but they do\r\nnot work so frequently in company, consequently they escape the\r\ndestructive influence of foul air; they are subject, like weavers,\r\nhowever, to disease of the stomach, owing to the constant pressure made\r\nupon it, in their case, by the last. Some old cobblers are found to have a\r\ndepression at the pit of the stomach of the shape of the heel of the boot,\r\nmoulded in fact by the pressure of this article, which he clasps between\r\nthis portion of his body and his knees whilst sewing. Like the milliners\r\nand tailors, their sight suffers through having to direct so fine an\r\nobject as a needle point: patent bootmakers are particularly liable to\r\nsuffer in their eyes through the brilliant blackness of the material they\r\nwork upon. We perceive that sewing-machines have been introduced into this\r\ntrade at Northampton, much to the disgust of those whom they will benefit.\r\nThe introduction of this useful machine will at once elevate this and\r\nscores of other handicrafts, such as those of tailors, milliners, glovers,\r\nand all who use the needle, to the dignity of manufacturers requiring\r\nconsiderable capital, the presence of which is some guarantee for the\r\nintelligence and benevolence of the masters, and for the adoption of\r\nlarger and more healthful workshops for their people. As this very large\r\nclass of workers numbers upwards of half a million in Great Britain, we\r\nhail the sewing-machine as an emancipator from drudgery of no ordinary\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe compositor, who works in an atmosphere very similar to that breathed\r\nby the tailor and milliner, is, like them, subject to severe pulmonary\r\ndiseases. In some newspaper offices they are planted as thickly as their\r\ntype-cases can stand, and they carry on their monotonous labour, which is\r\nconfined to a multitude of small motions of the right hand, conveying to\r\nthe left types in course of \"setting up,\" Jobbing printers, who have a\r\nmuch greater variety of motion, are invariably healthier than newspaper\r\ncompositors; and Dr. Guy has remarked that those compositors who work in\r\nthe upper stories of large establishments, and consequently in an\r\natmosphere reeking with the impurities which have ascended from the\r\ncrowded rooms below, and possibly from an engine-room in addition, are\r\nmuch more troubled with spitting of blood and consumption than those\r\nworking beneath them. In a printing office thus foully ventilated, he was\r\nenabled to make a very instructive comparison; for instance, there were\r\nfifteen men employed on the second floor, and seventeen men in precisely\r\nthe same way on the third and uppermost floor. On making personal\r\ninquiries of each of the men respecting his health, four only out of the\r\nfifteen on the second floor made any complaint; one was subject to\r\nindigestion, a second to cough, the third to ulcers of the legs, and the\r\nfourth was what might be termed a valetudinarian. But of the seventeen\r\nemployed on the uppermost floor, three had had spitting of blood, two were\r\nsubject to affections of the lungs, and five to constant and severe colds.\r\nTen of these seventeen, therefore, were subject to diseases affecting the\r\nchest, while only one of the fifteen in the room beneath had a disease of\r\nthis nature. In the course of his inquiries respecting the health of\r\nworkers in printing-offices, the same intelligent statist hit upon another\r\nfact with respect to pressmen, which appears to be of general application.\r\nPressmen, or those who take the impressions of the types set up by the\r\ncompositors, are generally located in the same building with them, and\r\noften in the same room, under precisely similar conditions as regards\r\nventilation and quality of air; yet a series of inquiries brings out the\r\nfact that the pressmen are far the healthier of the two. The only manner\r\nof accounting for this difference lies in the nature of their labour. The\r\npressman has to use long-sustained and somewhat violent exertions in\r\nswinging round the lever of his press, unfolding and refolding the tympan,\r\nand screwing up its bed. Compared to these varied muscular movements, the\r\ncompositor's hardest work is lifting types from his case to his\r\ncomposing-stick; yet the result is, that the pressman's liability to\r\nconsumption is but half that of the compositor, and of other diseases a\r\nthird less.\r\n\r\nThis is a very remarkable fact, and irresistibly points to the conclusion\r\nthat foul air and a heated atmosphere can be borne with far greater\r\nimpunity by those who labour hard than by those who employ themselves in a\r\nsedentary manner. The fair lady who honours us with her attention will\r\nperhaps draw a conclusion of her own from this experience, which, no\r\ndoubt, tallies with her practice and her instinct, that it is far better\r\nto waltz till five o'clock in the morning in a crowded ball-room than to\r\nremain for the same period a disconsolate \"wall-flower.\" There appears\r\nalso to be another law, with respect to the two classes of workmen,\r\nequally worthy of remark. The pressman, although he enjoys the best\r\nhealth, and the greatest green age, does not, in individual cases, live as\r\nlong as the compositor. In the same manner, the stalwart blacksmith,\r\nalthough a far healthier man than the tailor, and generally longer-lived,\r\ndoes not yet count so many patriarchs among his ranks as snip does. This\r\ncomparison holds good between those who take much or little exercise out\r\nof doors. Mr. Neison, who has carefully worked the fact out, in his volume\r\non Vital Statistics, gives the following highly interesting table:--\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |    |             EXPECTATION OF LIFE IN               |\r\n  |    |--------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Age.|In-door occupation, with|Out-door occupation, with|\r\n  |    |------------------------|-------------------------|\r\n  |    |   Little  |   Great    |  Little   |    Great    |\r\n  |    | Exercise. | Exercise.  | Exercise. |  Exercise.  |\r\n  |----|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------|\r\n  | 20 |  41·8822  |   42·0133  |  37·8017  |   43·4166   |\r\n  | 30 |  35·1170  |   34·5022  |  30·1435  |   36·5832   |\r\n  | 40 |  27·9113  |   27·8004  |  23·0357  |   29·1284   |\r\n  | 50 |  20·5022  |   21·1805  |  17·2754  |   21·9732   |\r\n  | 60 |  14·0430  |   15·1413  |  11·0169  |   15·5635   |\r\n  | 70 |   8·6490  |   10·4407  |   4·5607  |    9·3313   |\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThus, between twenty and thirty, the gardener, the labourer, the thatcher,\r\nthe drover, and the whole class of men who earn their bread toilfully in\r\nwind, rain, and sun, have the expectation of living at least six years\r\nlonger than the coachman, the watchman, and others who are equally exposed\r\nto the weather, but whose blood is not equally circulated or sweetened by\r\ncontinual and active exertion. It will be remarked also, that the out-door\r\nworker with little exercise comes off but badly in the comparison with the\r\nsedentary in-door worker--in other words, the coachman's is a worse life\r\nthan the shopman's. We suspect, however, with Mr. Neison, that\r\nintemperance must thus kick the beam against sedentary out-door\r\nemployments. We all know, for instance, that Jehu is not a teetotaller,\r\nand our suspicions are, moreover, strengthened by the fact that\r\nengine-drivers, who are forced to maintain a strict sobriety, although\r\namong the class of sedentary out-door workers and exposed to a hurricane\r\nof air, and to driving wet during the greater part of their existence--are\r\nyet remarkably free from consumption--the fell disease which decimates\r\nthe poor printer, who cannot tolerate the minutest draft in his place of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend in the social scale, it would naturally be supposed that we\r\nshould find the value of life greater, and occupations more healthy. It is\r\na great question, however, if the artisan, subject as he is to so many\r\ninjurious circumstances, has not the advantage over the shopkeeper. This\r\nmay appear at first impossible, but when we come to consider the life led\r\nby the tradesman, and especially by the smaller ones, who form so large a\r\nproportion of the class, we find they are subjected to an accumulation of\r\nadverse influences. In the generality of cases the individual of this\r\ngenus confines himself to the smallest possible amount of room, in which\r\nhe can possibly carry on his business--the rest of the house he lets off\r\nfor offices. In this confined space he lives, without taking any adequate\r\nexercise, often lying perdu in a dark inner room, through a peep-hole of\r\nwhich he watches for customers. At night, he inhales an atmosphere\r\npolluted by many gas-lights, and when, finally, the shutters are closed,\r\nhe will often be found sorting and placing away the goods disturbed during\r\nthe day. Under such circumstances, is it wonderful that he perishes at a\r\nmore rapid rate than the artisan who labours all day at some noxious\r\ntrade, and sleeps at night in some wretched lodging? It is well-known that\r\nthere is scarcely such a thing to be found as a London tradesman of the\r\nthird generation. The class is entirely kept up by the rosy-faced youths\r\nwho come up from the country full of hope and health, and then gradually\r\nsubside into the pallid tradesman of middle life, taking on, as it were,\r\nthe sad colour and aspect of the great city, just as hares and foxes turn\r\nwhite in northern latitudes, when winter brings about her snow.\r\n\r\nThere are certain classes of tradesmen who suffer from singular skin\r\ndiseases consequent upon handling articles of their trade. Thus the\r\nmiller, whose hands are constantly immersed in his meal, is subject to an\r\nirruptive disease of those members, in consequence of the attacks of the\r\nmeal-mite--a small insect to be found in some kinds of flour. The\r\ngrocer's itch, again, is occasioned by handling sugar infected with an\r\nanimalcule peculiar to it. We have seen sugar which absolutely moved\r\nthroughout its entire mass in consequence of the immense number of insects\r\npresent in it, and these readily attack the hand, and produce an irruption\r\nsimilar to that of the ordinary itch. Chimney-sweepers, again, suffer from\r\na more formidable disease--cancer induced by the irritative qualities of\r\nthe soot upon certain portions of the skin of the body. Neither must we\r\nomit from the ranks of unhealthy town occupations the squalid race of\r\nclerks, whose monotonous occupation and posture perpetually fixed in the\r\nform of a Z, renders them a very unhealthy class of men.\r\n\r\nWaiters in hotels and taverns sap their health by surreptitious tippling.\r\nA medical friend says, his experience of them is, that with few\r\nexceptions, they are _all rotten with perpetual imbibition_. Footmen do\r\nnot drink so much, but they are so grossly overfed and under-worked, that\r\nthey are always suffering from plethora. \"Jeames'\" aim is to run to\r\ncalves, but he pays the penalty for his ambition. They are, in fact, in\r\nthe position of the convicts at Fremantle, Australia, who, during the time\r\nthat our soldiers were dying for want of food in the Crimea, suffered from\r\nwhat was significantly called the gluttony plague. Excessive over-feeding\r\nand under-working was, it appears, the rule at the convict establishment;\r\nand, in consequence, no less than 1554 patients were under medical\r\ntreatment in less than six months, with diseases of the digestive organs,\r\ninflammatory affections of the eyes, and cutaneous eruptions. The physic\r\nof short allowance and plenty of work soon set matters to rights. It is\r\nnot often that the lower or middle classes suffer from over-feeding; but\r\ndrink is the bane of many trades and occupations. The gigantic brewer's\r\ndrayman, who seems built as a match for the Flemish team he drives, is but\r\na giant with feet of clay; his jolly looks are a delusion and a snare. The\r\nenormous amount of beer and stout he is allowed by his employers--on the\r\nprinciple, we suppose, that you should not muzzle the ox that treadeth\r\nout the corn--so deteriorates his blood, that a scratch prostrates him,\r\nand any serious illness is pretty sure to carry him off. The common\r\nlabourer, who lives under pretty much the same condition, with the\r\nexception of the temptation to drink, has an average life of 47-1/2 years,\r\nbut he is cut off at the early age of 43 years.\r\n\r\nIf we take another class of persons thrown continually in the way of\r\ntippling, we find the result is equally unfavourable. The pot-boy of the\r\nmetropolis, with whose doughy face and pert leer we are so well\r\nacquainted, scarcely lives out half his days. In his case, in addition to\r\ncontinual potations, he is perpetually breathing, until twelve o'clock at\r\nnight, an atmosphere compounded of drunkards' breath, stale tobacco, and\r\nall the impurities arising from the brilliant gas illumination of a\r\ngin-palace; it is not, therefore, surprising to find that his average age\r\nis but 41-1/2 years; while the footman may reckon upon helping himself to\r\nhis master's venison until he is 44-1/2 years old. The publican is almost\r\nas great a sinner as his man in the way of intemperance, and his life in\r\nconsequence is at least 2-1/2 years shorter than the very limited span of\r\nthe tradesman.\r\n\r\nDr. Guy, who has taken considerable pains to ascertain the value of life\r\nin the educated classes, has worked out the extraordinary result that, the\r\nhigher the step in the social hierarchy, the greater the means of\r\nself-indulgence, the less the chance of long life. People have so long\r\nbeen accustomed to look upon the possession of wealth as the best\r\nguarantee for a flourishing bodily condition, that they will be surprised,\r\nperhaps, to hear that in proportion as the wholesome stimulus of labour is\r\nwithdrawn from any class, in the same proportion the value of its average\r\nterm of life is shortened. And yet our common experience but tallies with\r\nthe results of scientific inquiry in this matter. When a man who has lived\r\na long and active life, suddenly retires with the idea that he has earned\r\nhis ease, and that it is time for him to enjoy himself, ten to one but he\r\nhas taken the most effectual method of shortening his life; and much as we\r\nmay smile at the taste of the retired soap-boiler, who always made a\r\npoint of going down to his old shop on \"boiling days,\" yet we can see that\r\nhis instinct directed him rightly, for we can none of us bear idleness,\r\nleast of all those who have long practised industry.\r\n\r\nRegularity, sobriety, and activity of mind and body, are the pabulum on\r\nwhich vital force is fed; while, on the contrary, luxury, licentiousness,\r\nand sloth, are the cankers of life. A comparison of the longevity of the\r\ndifferent educated classes proves this in a remarkable manner. Let us\r\ntake, for instance, the three learned professions. If the reader were\r\nasked whether the clergyman, the lawyer, or the physician lived longest,\r\nmost probably he would say the lawyer. Accustomed to venerable age on the\r\njudgment-seat, and struck with the fact that our leading law lords have\r\ngenerally been, and still are, noblemen of very advanced age, he would\r\nperhaps be justified in giving the palm of longevity to them. Yet, in\r\ntruth, as a class, they are the shortest-lived. The race is neck and neck,\r\nit is true, but they lose by a neck. The clergyman, as we should naturally\r\nsuppose, enjoys a higher standard of health, and attains a greater age,\r\nthan any member of the community, excepting poor Hodge, the humblest\r\nmember of his flock. His average age, taking those persons only into\r\naccount who have passed their 50th year, is 74·04 years, or rather better\r\nthan one year longer than the physician, who lives to an average age of\r\n72·95 years. This trifling difference, we should expect, as the latter is\r\nsubject to many chances of infection, and lives more a town life than the\r\nformer. If the comparison is made, however, between the highest grades of\r\nthe two professions, between archbishops and bishops, and baronets who\r\nhave filled the posts of physicians and surgeons to the sovereign, the\r\nlatter have the advantage by four years, and in both cases the lawyer lags\r\nbehind in the race with clergymen and physicians: with the latter in his\r\nordinary rank by a few days only, and with the class of medical baronets,\r\nas compared with judges, upwards of four years, how much hard study,\r\nalternated with tawny port, has to do with the difference, we should\r\nscarcely like to say. The gentry may be reckoned to be about as\r\nlong-lived as the clergy; well-housed, well-fed, and living an\r\nagricultural life with active habits, they have few diseases, and are\r\nespecially exempt from consumption. Officers of the navy have slightly the\r\nadvantage of those of the army--say one year of life. From this point,\r\nwhere the social hierarchy takes a leap, and clothes itself in the purple\r\nand fine linen of nobility, the lamp of life begins rapidly to burn low.\r\nThe aristocracy of this country are shorter-lived, by more than one year,\r\nthan he who works with all the cares and anxieties of the priest, the\r\nlawyer, or the physician; and members of royal houses (calculated from the\r\nages of members of continental as well as English royalty) descend the\r\nladder of life so rapidly, that they have three years less of existence\r\nthan the peer; and, lastly, we come to the \"round and top of sovereignty\r\nitself.\" The potentate who stands on the highest pinnacle of human\r\ngreatness, surrounded, it would seem, with every condition favourable to\r\ncomfort and longevity, fenced about from casualties which constantly beset\r\nthe paths of ordinary mortals--his would appear indeed a charmed life; yet\r\nthe hard fact will stare us in the face, that the sands of life run far\r\nquicker with him than with any other of the educated classes. His years\r\nare on an average but 64, or 10 less than the clergy, who probably have to\r\nfight the hardest battle in the world--the fight of comparative poverty\r\nagainst appearances. It could be \"clearly shown,\" says Mr. Neison, in his\r\n\"Vital Statistics,\" \"by tracing the various classes of society in which\r\nthere exists sufficient means of subsistence, by beginning with the most\r\nhumble, and passing on to the middle and upper classes, that a gradual\r\ndeterioration in the duration of life takes place; and that just as life,\r\nwith all its wealth, pomp, and magnificence, would seem to become more\r\nvaluable and tempting, so are its opportunities and chances of enjoyment\r\nlessened. As far as the results of figures admit of judging, this\r\ncondition would seem to flow directly from the luxurious and pampered\r\nstyle of living among the wealthier classes, whose artificial habits\r\ninterfere with the nature and degree of those physical exercises which, in\r\na simpler class of society, are accompanied with long life.\" Truly, there\r\nis a spirit of compensation in this life, if we could only \"distil it\r\nforth.\" The poor countryman of thirty years of age, who takes his frugal\r\nrepast under a hedge, has a chance of thirteen years' longer life than the\r\nmonarch of the same age clothed in purple, and lord, perhaps, of half the\r\nhabitable world!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This _cophee-house_ in Sweeting's Rents is not alluded to by Mr.\r\nCunningham in his Handbook of London. He mentions the first as established\r\nin 1657, in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, and the second (no date\r\nmentioned) as set up at the Rainbow in Fleet Street. We think we must make\r\nway for this new discovery between the two.\r\n\r\n[2] A furniture broker made his fortune by an advertisement headed \"Advice\r\nto Persons about to Marry.\" Our witty friend _Punch_ followed up this\r\nprelude with the single word _Don't_, as the substitute for the lists of\r\nfour-posted beds.\r\n\r\n[3] In an article upon the teas of commerce, which appeared in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society_ for July, 1851.\r\n\r\n[4] Assam tea is the only exception to this rule, but very little of it is\r\nimported.\r\n\r\n[5] That sold by Messrs. Dakin, of St. Paul's Churchyard.\r\n\r\n[6] It will be scarcely necessary to say that the great London brewers\r\nhave never laid themselves open to the suspicion of having adulterated\r\ntheir liquor.\r\n\r\n[7] An act has lately been passed which will, we trust, check in some\r\ndegree the grosser food-frauds on the public.\r\n\r\n[8] Since gone to make bears' grease.\r\n\r\n[9] The great merit of this inference may be judged from the circumstance\r\nthat several eminent naturalists, out of an honest regard for the\r\nreputation of Professor Owen, endeavoured to prevent the publication of\r\nthe paper in which, with the sure sagacity of scientific genius, he\r\nconfidently announced the fact.\r\n\r\n[10] The history of the migrations of the rat is involved in doubt, and\r\nnone of the accounts can be relied on. Goldsmith had been assured that the\r\nNorway rat, as it is called, though it was quite unknown in that country\r\nwhen it established itself in England, came to us from the coast of\r\nIreland, whither it had been carried in the ships that traded in\r\nprovisions to Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[11] When the atmospheric railway to Epsom was at work, the rats came for\r\nthe grease which was used to make the endless leather valve, which ran on\r\nthe top of the suction-pipe, air-tight. Some of them entered the tube,\r\nfrom which they were sucked with every passing train; nevertheless, day by\r\nday, others were immolated in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[12] A native in India, observing one day a rat run across the floor,\r\nstooped to look after it. While in this position he suddenly felt\r\nsomething tugging him back by his hair, and on putting up his hand found a\r\nlarge cobra struggling to free his teeth from his locks. The reptile had\r\nalso observed the rat, and had dropped from the roof, when the peon\r\nsuddenly interposed his person between the hunter and his prey. The snake\r\nand the rat escaped; but the magistrate of the district having ordered the\r\nhouse to be pulled down the next day, the cobra was found with the rat\r\nhalf digested in his stomach.\r\n\r\n[13] A single dead rat beneath a floor will render a room uninhabitable. A\r\nfinancier, of European celebrity, found his drawing-room intolerable. He\r\nsupposed that the drains were out of order, and went to a great expense to\r\nremedy the evil. The annoyance continued, and a ratcatcher guessed the\r\ncause of the mischief. On pulling up the boards, a dead rat was discovered\r\nnear the bell-wire. The bell had been rung as he was passing, and the\r\ncrank had caught and strangled him.\r\n\r\n[14] In a comfortable little apartment, which looked quite domestic in\r\ncomparison with the workhouse wards of ordinary lunatic asylums, we saw,\r\non our last visit, a young musician playing on a violoncello to an\r\nadmiring audience. Touches of similar enjoyment continually meet the\r\nvisitor, lighting up the moral atmosphere of the building with a\r\ncheerfulness totally at variance with his preconceived notions of this\r\nnotorious madhouse.\r\n\r\n[15] Steps are being taken, we believe, to effect this necessary change;\r\nbut unless Parliament puts its pressure upon the Home-Office, we shall\r\nexpect to see the arrangement completed when the Nelson Column is\r\nfinished, and not before.\r\n\r\n[16] The walls of one of the wards of Colney Hatch are decorated\r\nthroughout with well-executed bas-relief pictures from Greek subjects by a\r\npatient. We are informed that the lunatics who are transferred here from\r\nthe undecorated wards, enter the apartment with expressions of delight,\r\nand are particularly careful to preserve the objects of their pleasure in\r\ngood condition. In some metropolitan asylums the inmates have adorned\r\ntheir prison-house with pieces of sculpture and pictures; and the Germans\r\nare fond of indulging the love of colour by filling some of the windows\r\nwith stained glass. In France, abundance of flowers are placed about the\r\nestablishment, as being eminent sources of delight. In these particulars\r\nwe have not a little to learn from our continental brethren.\r\n\r\n[17] These particulars respecting the pauper lunatic colony of Gheel are\r\ntaken from an article by Dr. Webster in Dr. Winslow's _Journal of\r\nPsychological Medicine_. This review, which originated with and from the\r\nfirst has been under the able editorship of Dr. Forbes Winslow, has given\r\nan immense impulse to the study of psychology. It has enlarged the views\r\nof the physician of the insane, and, by extending his horizon, has given\r\nhim a far better knowledge of the special department to which he formerly\r\nconfined his studies. It is as impossible to understand the workings of a\r\nmorbid mind without possessing a knowledge of its ordinary action as it is\r\nto interpret the sounds of a diseased lung without being first acquainted\r\nwith those of a healthy one. The great service which Dr. Forbes Winslow\r\nhas rendered by unravelling the phenomena of mind in its normal as well as\r\nin its disordered state, entitles him to a very high meed of praise, and\r\nhas deservedly ranked him among the first medico-psychologists of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[18] In the subjoined passage, which is extracted from an official\r\ncommunication to the Commissioners in Lunacy, and published in one of\r\ntheir parliamentary reports, Dr. Forbes Winslow explains the principles\r\nwhich should guide the physician in the moral treatment of the insane when\r\nplaced under legal control and supervision:--\"In the management of the\r\ninsane, and in the conduct of asylums, both public and private, the\r\nprinciple of treatment should consist in a full and liberal recognition of\r\nthe importance of extending to the insane the _maximum_ amount of liberty\r\nand indulgence compatible with their safety, security, and recovery; at\r\nthe same time, subjecting them to the _minimum_ degree of mechanical and\r\nmoral restraint, isolation, seclusion, and surveillance, consistent with\r\ntheir actual morbid state of mind at the time. It is also necessary to\r\nbear in mind as an essential principle of curative treatment, the\r\nimportance of bringing the insane confined in asylums, as much as\r\npossible, within the sphere of social, kindly, and domestic influences. In\r\nmany cases, isolation, seclusion, and an absolute immunity from all kinds\r\nof stimuli, physical and mental, are, during the acute and recent stages\r\nof insanity, indispensably necessary to recovery; but in certain forms of\r\nmelancholia, monomania, and in some chronic morbid states of mind, no mode\r\nof moral treatment is productive of such great curative results as that\r\nnow referred to. I need not observe that this system of treatment cannot\r\nbe adopted except in those establishments where there is an active,\r\nexperienced, and intelligent resident medical officer, who fully\r\nappreciates the great value of such homely family influences upon the\r\nminds of the insane. In our moral treatment, do we not occasionally\r\nexhibit an excess of caution, and exercise, with the best and kindest\r\nintentions, an undue amount of moral restraint and vigilance? I think we\r\nmay sometimes err in being a little too distrustful of the insane. Whilst\r\nurging the necessity, in certain forms of morbid mind, of great and\r\nconstant watchfulness, particularly in cases of suicidal monomania, and\r\nrecent and acute attacks, I would suggest, to those having the management\r\nof asylums, the necessity, with the view to the adoption of a curative\r\nprocess of treatment, of placing more confidence in those entrusted to\r\ntheir care, and of allowing the patients a greater amount of freedom,\r\nindulgence, and liberty than they at present enjoy in many of our public\r\nand private asylums. In many phases of insanity in which confinement is\r\nindispensable, the patient's word may fully be relied upon; and under\r\ncertain well-defined restrictions, he should be permitted to feel that\r\nconfidence is reposed in him, and that he is trusted, and not altogether\r\n(although in confinement) deprived of his free and independent agency. I\r\nfeel quite assured that a judicious liberality of this kind will be\r\ngenerally followed by the happiest curative results, and greatly conduce\r\nto the comfort and happiness of the patient. Patients should be permitted\r\noccasionally to attend divine worship out of the asylum, when\r\ncircumstances do not contra-indicate this practice; they should be allowed\r\nalso to walk out of the confines of the asylum, to attend places of\r\namusement, visit scientific exhibitions; and the resident medical officer\r\nshould make himself their friend and companion; thus inspiring them with\r\nconfidence in his skill and kindly intentions, and reconciling them to the\r\ndegree of moral restraint to which they may be unavoidably subjected.\"\r\n\r\n[19] In Belgium, where many of the pauper lunatics are located in\r\nreligious houses and are attended upon by the frères and soeurs of these\r\nestablishments, it is not uncommon to find the patients at certain times\r\nof the day totally deserted and left to their own devices--the attendants\r\nbeing engaged in their religious duties!\r\n\r\n[20] It may be as well to state that the Poor-Law Commissioners also\r\nworked out the problem with very similar conclusions in 1851, and that the\r\ninvestigations made by the Swedish Government into the condition of the\r\ninsane in Norway in 1835 further corroborate the statement that insanity\r\nprevails to a greater extent in rural than in urban districts.\r\n\r\n[21] If the spectator, while leaning over the rail of the wharf and\r\nwatching \"Oyster Street,\" as the costermongers call the line of\r\noyster-boats moored side by side, has ever been at a loss to understand\r\nwhy it is that in the very height of the market, when the decks are\r\ncrowded with purchasers, the sailors are seen hanging about the boats, or\r\nseated upon the bulwarks, taking their morning pipes, whilst the duty of\r\nmeasuring and carrying the oysters is being performed by the \"Fellowships\"\r\nbelonging to the corporation of London, he will now know the reason. Steam\r\nwill, however, surely abolish many of these city abuses, and rail-borne\r\noysters will lend their powerful aid to rail-borne coal in abolishing\r\nregulations which are not in accordance with the emancipated spirit of the\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[22] Since this was written, the new market in Copenhagen Fields has been\r\nopened, and a totally different state of things now obtained.\r\n\r\n[23] This return contains some small proportion of game, the quantity of\r\nwhich is not stated.\r\n\r\n[24] There is, we confess, some little discrepancy between this estimate\r\nof the country-killed meat at Newgate, and the known quantity brought in\r\nby railway, as most assuredly 161,200 oxen, 509,600 sheep, and 62,400\r\ncalves and pigs, far outweigh the 36,487 tons of meat brought by the\r\ndifferent lines, even \"sinking\" the offal. But so assured is Mr. Giblett,\r\nand the Smithfield Commissioners with him, that he is under the mark, that\r\nwe give credit to his estimate, and take it for granted that much\r\ncountry-killed meat must come to market by other conveyance than the\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\n[25] Since the above was written, these fine buildings have been taken\r\npossession of by Sir William Armstrong, where, under the veil of secrecy,\r\nhis extraordinary ordnance is now constructed to the entire exclusion of\r\nthe old style of cannon.\r\n\r\n[26] The French manufacturer who executed the order addressed a letter to\r\none of the Emperor's chamberlains, from which we take the following\r\nextract:--\"It is, I believe, the first time that England, who was hitherto\r\nregarded as able to supply the most unforeseen wants of her army, should\r\nfind herself obliged to have recourse to French industry. I had it too\r\nmuch at heart to sustain the reputation of my country in the eyes of our\r\nrivals to leave anything undone towards the execution of an order which\r\nwas intrusted to me, and I have had the satisfaction of receiving from the\r\nEnglish Government the most flattering compliments. With a view to\r\nperpetuate the memory of that operation, which is almost an event in\r\nindustry, I have ordered a medal to be engraved by M. Louis Merley, who\r\ngained the great prize at Rome, and who is one of the artists of whom\r\nFrance is proud. I desire earnestly to obtain the favour of presenting\r\nthis medal to his Majesty the Emperor, as also the model of the rifles\r\nfabricated for England; and I pray your Excellency to be good enough to\r\nsolicit for me an audience of his Majesty.\" The audience was granted, and\r\nthe medal and the model of the fire-arm presented in due form.\r\n\r\n[27] The merchants are provided annually with a sample of Waltham Abbey\r\npowder to guide them in their manufacture.\r\n\r\n[28] We may more truly liken the system to the warming apparatus of a\r\nhot-house. The hot waters of the Gulf, conducted across the Atlantic, are\r\nthe forcing power which stimulates the vegetation of Cornwall, whence the\r\nLondon market is supplied with its early vegetables.\r\n\r\n[29] The effect of this Act, which passed in 1839, was most marked. In the\r\nthree years previous, the average annual loss of timber ships was 56-1/2,\r\nand the loss of life 300. In the three years subsequent to its coming into\r\noperation the loss of ships fell to 23-1/2, and the loss of life to 106.\r\n\r\n[30] Whilst the civil workman is called in to do the work of the soldier\r\nat home, strangely enough we send out the soldier to do the work of the\r\nemigrant abroad. A force of Royal Engineers some time since left these\r\nshores for the purpose of discharging this office in British Columbia.\r\n\r\n[31] Mr. Jeffreys informs us that he saw during the mutiny a recruiting\r\nsergeant's placard in which there was an engraving of a British trooper\r\ncutting down a Sepoy and taking from him a bag of treasure.\r\n\r\n[32] This idea of a sanitary officer for armies in the field originated\r\nwith Mr. J. Ranald Martin, who has long advocated the measure in his\r\ncorrespondence with the medical journals, and with the East India\r\nGovernment. To this gentleman we also owe the suggestion of a health\r\nofficer in civil life.\r\n\r\n[33] Code of letter signals in the needle telegraph commonly used in\r\nEngland. Two needles are generally employed, in order to facilitate the\r\ntransmission of signals:--\r\n\r\nLet _a_ denote a deflection of the _left-hand needle to the left_, _a´ to\r\nthe right_; _b_ a deflection of the _right-hand needle to the left_, _b´\r\nto the right_. Then here is the code:\r\n\r\n  +  _a_\r\n  A  _a a_\r\n  B  _a a a_\r\n  C  _a´ a_\r\n  D  _a a´_\r\n  E  _a´_\r\n  F  _a´ a´_\r\n  G  _a´ a´ a´_\r\n  H  _b_\r\n  I  _b b_\r\n  K  _b b b_\r\n  L  _b´ b_\r\n  M  _b b´_\r\n  N  _b´_\r\n  O  _b´ b´_\r\n  P  _b´ b´ b´_\r\n  R  _a b_\r\n  S  _a a b b_\r\n  T  _a a a b b b_\r\n  U  _a´ a b´ b_\r\n  W  _a´ b´_\r\n  X  _a´ a´ b´ b´_\r\n  Y  _a´ a´ a´ b´ b´ b´_\r\n\r\nThus F is indicated by two successive deflections of the left-hand needle\r\nto the right; R by a simultaneous deflection of both needles to the left.\r\nWhere both needles are required they may be and are deflected\r\nsimultaneously; where one only is used its deflections must of necessity\r\nbe successive. The sign + means \"I do not understand;\" the letter E \"I do\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n[34] It may interest our readers to reproduce the first published notice\r\nwe can find of Professor Wheatstone's experiments relating to the electric\r\ntelegraph, and which appeared anterior to his connection with Mr.\r\nCooke:--\"During the month of June last year (1836), in a course of\r\nlectures delivered at King's College, London, Professor Wheatstone\r\nrepeated his experiments on the velocity of electricity which were\r\npublished in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1834, but with an\r\ninsulated circuit of copper wire, the length of which was now increased to\r\nnearly four miles; the thickness of the wire was 1-16th of an inch. When\r\nmachine electricity was employed, an electrometer placed on any point of\r\nthe circuit diverged, and, wherever the continuity of the circuit was\r\nbroken, bright sparks were visible. With a voltaic battery, or with a\r\nmagneto-electric machine, water was decomposed, the needle of the\r\ngalvanometer was deflected, &c., in the middle of the circuit. But, which\r\nhas a more direct reference to the subject of our esteemed correspondent's\r\ncommunication from Munich, Professor Wheatstone gave a sketch of the means\r\nby which he proposes to convert his apparatus into an electrical\r\ntelegraph, which, by the aid of a few finger stops, will instantaneously,\r\nand distinctly, convey communications between the most distant points.\r\nThese experiments are, we understand, still in progress, and the\r\napparatus, as it is at present constructed, is capable of conveying thirty\r\nsimple signals, which, combined in various manners, will be fully\r\nsufficient for the purposes of telegraphic communication.\"--From the\r\n_Magazine of Popular Science_ (Parker, Strand) for March 1, 1837.\r\n\r\n[35]\r\n\r\n  _a_ -\r\n  _b_ - ---- -\r\n  _c_ ---- - -\r\n  _d_ - - - ----\r\n  _e_ - -\r\n  _f_ ---- ----\r\n  _g_ - ---- - -\r\n  _h_ ---- ---- ----\r\n  _i_ - - -\r\n  _j_ - - ---- - -\r\n  _k_ - ---- ---- -\r\n  _l_ - ----\r\n  _m_ - ---- - ----\r\n  _n_ - ---- ----\r\n  _o_ - - - -\r\n  _p_ - - ---- -\r\n  _q_ ---- - ---- -\r\n  _r_ ----\r\n  _s_ ---- -\r\n  _t_ - - ----\r\n  _u_ - - - - -\r\n  _v_ ---- ---- -\r\n  _w_ ---- ---- - -\r\n  _x_ ---- - - ----\r\n  _y_ ---- - ----\r\n  _z_ ---- - - -\r\n\r\n[36] In justice to the Company, which is very properly jealous of the\r\nparticulars of its messages transpiring, we beg to state that we acquired\r\nthe above fact from a person totally disconnected with the Electric\r\nTelegraph Office.\r\n\r\n[37] Mr. Reuter now performs this duty both for home and foreign news.\r\n\r\n[38] The use of the metal or earth-plate will be understood from the\r\nfollowing statement of Steinheil:--\"Owing to the low conducting power of\r\nwater or the ground, compared with metals, it is necessary that at the two\r\nplaces where the metal conductor is in connection with the soil, the\r\nformer should present very large surfaces of contact. Assuming that water\r\nconducts two million times worse than copper, a surface of water\r\nproportional to this must be brought into contact with the water. If the\r\nsection of a copper wire is 0·5 of a square line, it will require a copper\r\nplate of 61 square feet surface in order to conduct the galvanic current\r\nthrough the ground, as the wire in question would conduct it.\"\r\n\r\n[39] It may be as well to state that nearly all the continental telegraphs\r\nhave formed themselves into a confederacy, called the Austro-Germanic\r\nUnion, which includes the lines of Austria, Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria,\r\nHanover, Würtemberg, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the Grand Duchy of\r\nBaden. The Union regulates the tariff and all questions relative to the\r\nworking of the allied lines.\r\n\r\n[40] See \"Tariff of the Rates charged for general Dispatches on the\r\nPittsburgh and Louisville Telegraph, Jones's Electric Telegraph, New\r\nYork,\" p. 105.\r\n\r\n[41] The West of England Fire-Office, which retains the command of its own\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n[42]\r\n\r\n  The following are the stations:--            No. of engines.\r\n\r\n  Watling Street (the principal station)              4\r\n  Wellclose Square                                    3\r\n  Farringdon Street                                   4\r\n  Chandos Street, Covent Garden                       3\r\n  Schoolhouse Lane, Ratcliffe                         1\r\n  Horseferry Road, Westminster                        1\r\n  Waterloo Road                                       1\r\n  Paradise Row, Rotherhithe                           1\r\n  Jeffrey Square, St. Mary-Axe                        2\r\n  Whitecross Street                                   1\r\n  High Holborn, No. 254                               2\r\n  Crown Street, Soho                                  2\r\n  Wells Street, Oxford Street                         1\r\n  Baker Street, Portman Square                        1\r\n  King Street, Golden Square                          3\r\n  Southwark Bridge Road                               3\r\n  Morgan's Lane, Tooley Street                        1\r\n  Floating engine, off King's Stairs, Rotherhithe     1\r\n          \"        off Southwark Bridge               1-36\r\n\r\n[43] Repeated reference to this valuable work has more than confirmed the\r\nopinion we originally expressed of it. There are few books of greater\r\nutility than what is in fact a \"History of London, Past and Present.\"\r\n\r\n[44] The roof of the pile of buildings composing Somerset-House is also\r\ncontinuous, thereby greatly increasing the risk of the entire building, if\r\none portion of it were to catch.\r\n\r\n[45] In Nottingham, where they have gypsum in the neighbourhood, as they\r\nhave in Paris, they form their floors and partitions in the same solid\r\nmanner, and the consequence is, that a building is rarely burned down in\r\nthat town.\r\n\r\n[46] The following are the stations of the fire-escapes:--\r\n\r\n_Western District._--1.

The love of books evinced by this\r\ngentleman sufficiently proves that literary tastes are not incompatible\r\nwith the energetic performance of police duties.\r\n\r\n[48] The partiality for the cook ascribed to the policeman is, we are\r\nassured, a slander upon the force. The commissariat at home is too good to\r\njustify any suspicion of this ignoble sort of cupboard love.\r\n\r\n[49] We have extracted this anecdote from the very interesting work\r\npublished by Captain Chesterton, entitled \"Revelations of Prison Life.\"\r\n\r\n[50] Since the above was written, the attention of Government has been\r\ndrawn to the condition of our mines, and a commission of inquiry will\r\nspeedily, we hear, be appointed.\r\n\r\n[51] W. T. Cox, Esq., in _British Medical Journal_.\r\n\r\n[52] A just appreciation of the value of life is, perhaps, of more\r\nimportance to Friendly Societies than to Insurance Offices, inasmuch, as\r\nthe range of sickness in the working classes is much more extensive than\r\nin the upper and middle walks of life. Mr. Hardwick, in his manual on\r\nenrolled Friendly Societies, has pointed out the fact that the vast\r\nmajority of these societies are based upon calculations which must in the\r\nend terminate in their bankruptcy: and among the causes which tend to this\r\ndisastrous result he mentions the total disregard evinced in these clubs\r\nto a proper estimate of the states of health in different occupations and\r\nlocalities. It must be clear that the potter, whose average amount of\r\nillness between the ages of 20 and 70 is more than 333 weeks, obtains a\r\nvery unfair advantage over clerks or schoolmasters who may happen to be in\r\nthe same club with him, and whose average of sickness during the same\r\nperiod is only 48 weeks. The dyer, again, who, under the present system of\r\nmanagement of Friendly Societies, may be admitted to a club on the same\r\nterms as a wheelwright, claims for 293 weeks of sickness against the\r\nwheelwright's 64. The healthy country artisan is thus made to pay for the\r\nunhealthy town mechanic. If we take the case, again, of the miner or the\r\nSheffield grinder, and huddle him, without inquiry, into the same Friendly\r\nSociety as the agricultural labourer, it must be clear that the latter\r\nmust pay for the more than average sickness of his fellows. Until the\r\nrelative value of life and of sickness among the working classes is\r\nthoroughly understood and acted upon, as regards the payments of members,\r\nit is clear that the healthy trades must be sacrificed to the unhealthy\r\nones.\r\n\r\n[53] An ingenious Frenchman, of the name of Bernot, has just invented a\r\nfile-cutting machine which will, we trust, come generally into use, and do\r\naway with the paralysis arising from the present handicraft. It is said\r\nthat the workmanship of the machine is more even than the hand-work: the\r\nfiles cut in the morning by the artisan being superior to those cut in the\r\nafternoon, in consequence of his muscles becoming tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _italics_.\r\n\r\nThe original text contains several images of a right-pointing hand.
