F. BRINKLEY, R. A.\r\n\r\nEditor of the \"Japan Mail\"\r\n\r\nWith the Collaboration of BARON KIKUCHI\r\n\r\nFormer President of the Imperial University at Kyoto\r\n\r\nWith 150 Illustrations Engraved on Wood by Japanese Artists;\r\nHalf-Tone Plates, and Maps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATED BY GRACIOUS PERMISSION TO HIS MAJESTY MEIJI TENNO, THE LATE\r\nEMPEROR OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nIt is trite to remark that if you wish to know really any people, it\r\nis necessary to have a thorough knowledge of their history, including\r\ntheir mythology, legends and folk-lore: customs, habits and traits of\r\ncharacter, which to a superficial observer of a different nationality\r\nor race may seem odd and strange, sometimes even utterly subversive\r\nof ordinary ideas of morality, but which can be explained and will\r\nappear quite reasonable when they are traced back to their origin.\r\nThe sudden rise of the Japanese nation from an insignificant position\r\nto a foremost rank in the comity of nations has startled the world.\r\nExcept in the case of very few who had studied us intimately, we were\r\na people but little raised above barbarism trying to imitate Western\r\ncivilisation without any capacity for really assimilating or adapting\r\nit. At first, it was supposed that we had somehow undergone a sudden\r\ntransformation, but it was gradually perceived that such could not be\r\nand was not the case; and a crop of books on Japan and the Japanese,\r\ndeep and superficial, serious and fantastic, interesting and\r\notherwise, has been put forth for the benefit of those who were\r\ncurious to know the reason of this strange phenomenon. But among so\r\nmany books, there has not yet been, so far as I know, a history of\r\nJapan, although a study of its history was most essential for the\r\nproper understanding of many of the problems relating to the Japanese\r\npeople, such as the relation of the Imperial dynasty to the people,\r\nthe family system, the position of Buddhism, the influence of the\r\nChinese philosophy, etc. A history of Japan of moderate size has\r\nindeed long been a desideratum; that it was not forthcoming was no\r\ndoubt due to the want of a proper person to undertake such a work.\r\nNow just the right man has been found in the author of the present\r\nwork, who, an Englishman by birth, is almost Japanese in his\r\nunderstanding of, and sympathy with, the Japanese people. It would\r\nindeed be difficult to find any one better fitted for the task--by no\r\nmeans an easy one--of presenting the general features of Japanese\r\nhistory to Western readers, in a compact and intelligible form, and\r\nat the same time in general harmony with the Japanese feeling. The\r\nWestern public and Japan are alike to be congratulated on the\r\nproduction of the present work. I may say this without any fear of\r\nreproach for self-praise, for although my name is mentioned in the\r\ntitle-page, my share is very slight, consisting merely in general\r\nadvice and in a few suggestions on some special points.\r\n\r\nDAIROKU KIKUCHI.\r\n\r\nKYOTO, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nDuring the past three decades Japanese students have devoted much\r\nintelligent labour to collecting and collating the somewhat\r\ndisjointed fragments of their country's history. The task would have\r\nbeen practically impossible for foreign historiographers alone, but\r\nnow that the materials have been brought to light there is no\r\ninsuperable difficulty in making them available for purposes of joint\r\ninterpretation. That is all I have attempted to do in these pages,\r\nand I beg to solicit pardon for any defect they may be found to\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nF.

FUJI SEEN FROM THE FUJI-GAWA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORIOGRAPHER'S ART IN OLD JAPAN\r\n\r\nMATERIALS FOR HISTORY\r\n\r\nIN the earliest eras of historic Japan there existed a hereditary\r\ncorporation of raconteurs (Katari-be) who, from generation to\r\ngeneration, performed the function of reciting the exploits of the\r\nsovereigns and the deeds of heroes. They accompanied themselves on\r\nmusical instruments, and naturally, as time went by, each set of\r\nraconteurs embellished the language of their predecessors, adding\r\nsupernatural elements, and introducing details which belonged to the\r\nrealm of romance rather than to that of ordinary history. These\r\nKatari-be would seem to have been the sole repository of their\r\ncountry's annals until the sixth century of the Christian era. Their\r\nrepertories of recitation included records of the great families as\r\nwell as of the sovereigns, and it is easy to conceive that the favour\r\nand patronage of these high personages were earned by ornamenting the\r\ntraditions of their households and exalting their pedigrees. But when\r\nthe art of writing was introduced towards the close of the fourth\r\ncentury, or at the beginning of the fifth, and it was seen that in\r\nChina, then the centre of learning and civilization, the art had been\r\napplied to the compilation of a national history as well as of other\r\nvolumes possessing great ethical value, the Japanese conceived the\r\nambition of similarly utilizing their new attainment. For reasons\r\nwhich will be understood by and by, the application of the\r\nideographic script to the language of Japan was a task of immense\r\ndifficulty, and long years must have passed before the attainment of\r\nany degree of proficiency.\r\n\r\nThus it was not until the time of the Empress Suiko (593-628) that\r\nthe historical project took practical shape. Her Majesty, at the\r\ninstance, doubtless, of Prince Shotoku, one of the greatest names in\r\nall Japan's annals, instructed the prince himself and her chief\r\nminister, Soga no Umako, to undertake the task of compiling\r\nhistorical documents, and there resulted a Record of the Emperors\r\n(Tennoki), a Record of the Country (Koki), and Original Records\r\n(Hongi) of the Free People (i.e., the Japanese proper as\r\ndistinguished from aliens, captives, and aborigines), of the great\r\nfamilies and of the 180 Hereditary Corporations (Be). This work was\r\ncommenced in the year 620, but nothing is known as to the date of its\r\ncompletion. It represents the first Japanese history. A shortlived\r\ncompilation it proved, for in the year 645, the Soga chiefs,\r\ncustodians of the documents, threw them into the fire on the eve of\r\ntheir own execution for treason. One only, the Record of the Country,\r\nwas plucked from the flames, and is believed to have been\r\nsubsequently incorporated in the Kojiki '(Records of Ancient\r\nThings).' No immediate attempt seems to have been made to remedy the\r\nloss of these invaluable writings. Thirty-seven years later the\r\nEmperor Temmu took the matter in hand. One of his reasons for doing\r\nso has been historically transmitted. Learning that \"the chronicles\r\nof the sovereigns and the original words in the possession of the\r\nvarious families deviated from the truth and were largely amplified\r\nwith empty falsehoods,\" his Majesty conceived that unless speedy\r\nsteps were taken to correct the confusion and eliminate the errors,\r\nan irremediable state of affairs would result.\r\n\r\nSuch a preface prepares us to learn that a body of experts was\r\nappointed to distinguish the true and the false, and to set down the\r\nformer alone. The Emperor did, in fact, commission a number of\r\nprinces and officials to compile an authentic history, and we shall\r\npresently see how their labours resulted. But in the first place a\r\nspecial feature of the situation has to be noted. The Japanese\r\nlanguage was then undergoing a transition. In order to fit it to the\r\nChinese ideographs for literary purposes, it was being deprived of\r\nits mellifluous polysyllabic character and reduced to monosyllabic\r\nterseness. The older words were disappearing, and with them many of\r\nthe old traditions. Temmu saw that if the work of compilation was\r\nabandoned solely to princely and official littérateurs, they would\r\nprobably sacrifice on the altar of the ideograph much that was\r\nvenerable and worthy to be preserved. He therefore himself undertook\r\nthe collateral task of having the antique traditions collected and\r\nexpurgated, and causing them to be memorized by a chamberlain, Hiyeda\r\nno Are, a man then in his twenty-eighth year, who was gifted with\r\nability to repeat accurately everything heard once by him. Are's mind\r\nwas soon stored with a mass of ancient facts and obsolescent\r\nphraseology, but before either the task of official compilation or\r\nthat of private restoration had been carried to completion the\r\nEmperor died (686), and an interval of twenty-five years elapsed\r\nbefore the Empress Gemmyo, on the 18th of September, 711, ordered a\r\nscholar, Ono Yasumaro, to transcribe the records stored in Are's\r\nmemory. Four months sufficed for the work, and on the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 712, Yasumaro submitted to the Throne the Kojiki (Records of\r\nAncient Things) which ranked as the first history of Japan, and which\r\nwill be here referred to as the Records.\r\n\r\nTHE NIHONGI AND THE NIHON SHOKI\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to revert now to the unfinished work of the classical\r\ncompilers, as they may be called, whom the Emperor Temmu nominated in\r\n682, but whose labours had not been concluded when his Majesty died\r\nin 686. There is no evidence that their task was immediately\r\ncontinued in an organized form, but it is related that during the\r\nreign of Empress Jito (690-696) further steps were taken to collect\r\nhistorical materials, and that the Empress Gemmyo (708-715)--whom we\r\nhave seen carrying out, in 712, her predecessor Temmu's plan with\r\nregard to Hiyeda no Are--added, in 714, two skilled littérateurs to\r\nTemmu's classical compilers, and thus enabled them to complete their\r\ntask, which took the shape of a book called the Nihongi (Chronicle of\r\nJapan).\r\n\r\nThis work, however, did not prove altogether satisfactory. It was\r\nwritten, for the most part, with a script called the Manyo syllabary;\r\nthat is to say, with Chinese ideographs employed phonetically, and it\r\ndid not at all attain the literary standard of its Chinese prototype.\r\nTherefore, the Empress entrusted to Prince Toneri and Ono Yasumaro\r\nthe task of revising it, and their amended manuscript, concluded in\r\n720, received the name of Nihon Shoki (Written Chronicles of Japan),\r\nthe original being distinguished as Kana Nihongi, or Syllabic\r\nChronicles. The Nihon Shoki consisted originally of thirty-one\r\nvolumes, but of these one, containing the genealogies of the\r\nsovereigns, has been lost. It covers the whole of the prehistoric\r\nperiod and that part of the historic which extends from the accession\r\nof the Emperor Jimmu (660 B.C.) to the abdication of the Empress Jito\r\n(A.D. 697). The Kojiki extends back equally far, but terminates at\r\nthe death of the Empress Suiko (A.D. 628).\r\n\r\nTHE FUDOKI\r\n\r\nIn the year 713, when the Empress Gemmyo was on the throne, all the\r\nprovinces of the empire received orders to submit to the Court\r\nstatements setting forth the natural features of the various\r\nlocalities, together with traditions and remarkable occurrences.\r\nThese documents were called Fudoki (Records of Natural Features).\r\nMany of them have been lost, but a few survive, as those of Izumo,\r\nHarima, and Hitachi.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE RECORDS AND THE CHRONICLES\r\n\r\nThe task of applying ideographic script to phonetic purposes is\r\nexceedingly difficult. In the ideographic script each character has a\r\ndistinct sound and a complete meaning. Thus, in China shan signifies\r\n\"mountain,\" and ming \"light.\" But in Japanese \"mountain\" becomes yama\r\nand \"light\" akari. It is evident, then, that one of two things has to\r\nbe done. Either the sounds of the Japanese words must be changed to\r\nthose of the Chinese ideographs; or the sounds of the Chinese\r\nideographs must alone be taken (irrespective of their meaning), and\r\nwith them a phonetic syllabary must be formed. Both of these devices\r\nwere employed by a Japanese scholar of early times. Sometimes\r\ndisregarding the significance of the ideographs altogether, he used\r\nthem simply as representing sounds, and with them built up pure\r\nJapanese words; at other times, he altered the sounds of Japanese\r\nwords to those of their Chinese equivalents and then wrote them\r\nfrankly with their ideographic symbols.\r\n\r\nIn this way each Japanese word came to have two pronunciations:\r\nfirst, its own original sound for colloquial purposes; and second,\r\nits borrowed sound for purposes of writing. At the outset the spoken\r\nand the written languages were doubtless kept tolerably distinct. But\r\nby degrees, as respect for Chinese literature developed, it became a\r\nlearned accomplishment to pronounce Japanese words after the Chinese\r\nmanner, and the habit ultimately acquired such a vogue that the\r\nlanguage of men--who wrote and spoke ideographically--grew to be\r\ndifferent from the language of women--who wrote and spoke\r\nphonetically. When Hiyeda no Are was required to memorize the annals\r\nand traditions collected and revised at the Imperial Court, the\r\nlanguage in which he committed them to heart was pure Japanese, and\r\nin that language he dictated them, twenty-nine years later, to the\r\nscribe Yasumaro. The latter, in setting down the products of Are's\r\nmemory, wrote for the most part phonetically; but sometimes, finding\r\nthat method too cumbersome, he had recourse to the ideographic\r\nlanguage, with which he was familiar. At all events, adding nothing\r\nnor taking away anything, he produced a truthful record of the myths,\r\ntraditions, and salient historical incidents credited by the Japanese\r\nof the seventh century.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed, nevertheless, that Are's memory, however\r\ntenacious, failed in many respects, and that his historical details\r\nwere comparatively meagre. An altogether different spirit presided at\r\nthe work subsequently undertaken by this same Yasumaro, when, in\r\nconjunction with other scholars, he was required to collate the\r\nhistorical materials obtained abundantly from various sources since\r\nthe vandalism of the Soga nobles. The prime object of these\r\ncollaborators was to produce a Japanese history worthy to stand side\r\nby side with the classic models of China. Therefore, they used the\r\nChinese language almost entirely, the chief exception being in the\r\ncase of the old poems, a great number of which appear in the Records\r\nand the Chronicles alike. The actual words of these poems had to be\r\npreserved as well as the metre, and therefore it was necessary to\r\nindite them phonetically. For the rest, the Nihon Shoki, which\r\nresulted from the labours of these annalists and literati, was so\r\nChinese that its authors did not hesitate to draw largely upon the\r\ncosmogonic myths of the Middle Kingdom, and to put into the mouths of\r\nJapanese monarchs, or into their decrees, quotations from Chinese\r\nliterature. \"As a repertory of ancient Japanese myth and legend there\r\nis little to choose between the Records and the Chronicles. The\r\nformer is, on the whole, the fuller of the two, and contains legends\r\nwhich the latter passes over in silence; but the Chronicles, as we\r\nnow have them, are enriched by variants of the early myths, the value\r\nof which, for purposes of comparison, is recognized by scientific\r\ninquirers. But there can be no comparison between the two works when\r\nviewed as history. Hiyeda no Are's memory cannot be expected to\r\ncompete in fullness and accuracy with the abundant documentary\r\nliterature accessible to the writers of the Chronicles, and an\r\nexamination of the two works shows that, in respect to the record of\r\nactual events, the Chronicles are far the more useful authority\".*\r\n\r\n*Aston's Nihongi.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be supposed, too, that the authors of both works\r\nconfused the present with the past, and, in describing the manners\r\nand customs of by-gone eras, unconsciously limned their pictures with\r\ncolours taken from the palette of their own times, \"when the national\r\nthought and institutions had become deeply modified by Chinese\r\ninfluences.\" Valuable as the two books are, therefore, they cannot be\r\naccepted without large limitations. The Nihon Shoki occupied a high\r\nplace in national esteem from the outset. In the year following its\r\ncompilation, the Empress Gensho summoned eminent scholars to the\r\nCourt and caused them to deliver lectures on the contents of the\r\nbook, a custom which was followed regularly by subsequent sovereigns\r\nand still finds a place among the New Year ceremonials. This book\r\nproved to be the precursor of five others with which it is commonly\r\nassociated by Japanese scholars. They are the Zoku Nihongi\r\n(Supplementary Chronicles of Japan), in forty volumes, which covers\r\nthe period from 697 to 791 and was finished in 798; the Nihon Koki\r\n(Later Chronicles of Japan), in forty volumes--ten only\r\nsurvive--which covers the period from 792 to 833; the Zoku Nihon Koki\r\n(Supplementary Later Chronicles), in twenty volumes, which covers the\r\nsingle reign of the Emperor Nimmyo (834-850) and was compiled in 869;\r\nthe Montoku Jitsu-roku (True Annals of Montoku), in ten volumes,\r\ncovering the reign of Montoku (851-858), and compiled in 879, and the\r\nSandai Jitsu-roku (True Annals of Three Reigns) in fifty volumes,\r\ncovering the period from 859 to 887 and compiled in 901. These five\r\ncompilations together with the Nihon Shoki are honoured as the Six\r\nNational Histories. It is noticeable that the writers were men of the\r\nhighest rank, from prime ministers downwards. In such honour was the\r\nhistoriographer's art held in Japan in the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY\r\n\r\nBefore beginning to read Japanese history it is necessary to know\r\nsomething of the chronology followed in its pages. There have been in\r\nJapan four systems for counting the passage of time. The first is by\r\nthe reigns of the Emperors. That is to say, the first year of a\r\nsovereign's reign--reckoning from the New Year's day following his\r\naccession--became the 1 of the series, and the years were thenceforth\r\nnumbered consecutively until his death or abdication. This method\r\nmight be sufficiently accurate if the exact duration of each reign\r\nwere known as well as the exact sequence of the reigns. But no such\r\nprecision could be expected in the case of unwritten history,\r\ntransmitted orally from generation to generation. Thus, while\r\nJapanese annalists, by accepting the aggregate duration of all the\r\nreigns known to them, arrive at the conclusion that the first\r\nEmperor, Jimmu, ascended the throne in the year 660 B.C., it is found\r\non analysis that their figures assign to the first seventeen\r\nsovereigns an average age of 109 years.\r\n\r\nThe second system was by means of periods deriving their name (nengo)\r\nfrom some remarkable incident. Thus, the discovery of copper in Japan\r\nwas commemorated by calling the year Wado (Japanese copper), and the\r\nera so called lasted seven years. Such a plan was even more liable to\r\nerror than the device of reckoning by reigns, and a specially\r\nconfusing feature was that the first year of the period dated\r\nretrospectively from the previous New Year's day, so that events were\r\noften recorded as having occurred in the final year of one period and\r\nin the opening year of another. This system was originally imported\r\nfrom China in the year A.D. 645, and is at present in use, the year\r\n1910 being the forty-third of the Meiji (Enlightenment and Peace)\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe third system was that of the sexagenary cycle. This was operated\r\nafter the manner of a clock having two concentric dials, the\r\ncircumference of the larger dial being divided into ten equal parts,\r\neach marked with one of the ten \"celestial signs,\" and the\r\ncircumference of the smaller dial being divided into twelve equal\r\nparts each marked with one of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The\r\nlong hand of the clock, pointing to the larger dial, was supposed to\r\nmake one revolution in ten years, and the shorter hand, pointing to\r\nthe small dial, revolved once in twelve years. Thus, starting from\r\nthe point where the marks on the two dials coincide, the long hand\r\ngained upon the short hand by one-sixtieth each year, and once in\r\nevery sixty years the two hands were found at the point of\r\nconjunction. Years were indicated by naming the \"celestial stem\" and\r\nthe zodiacal sign to which the imaginary hands happen to be pointing,\r\njust as clock-time is indicated by the minutes read from the long\r\nhand and the hours from the short. The sexagenary cycle came into use\r\nin China in 623 B.C. The exact date of its importation into Japan is\r\nunknown, but it was probably about the end of the fourth century A.D.\r\nIt is a sufficiently accurate manner of counting so long as the tale\r\nof cycles is carefully kept, but any neglect in that respect exposes\r\nthe calculator to an error of sixty years or some multiple of sixty.\r\nKeen scrutiny and collation of the histories of China, Korea, and\r\nJapan have exposed a mistake of at least 120 years connected with the\r\nearliest employment of the sexagenary cycle in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe fourth method corresponds to that adopted in Europe where the\r\nnumber of a year is referred to the birth of Christ. In Japan, the\r\naccession of the Emperor Jimmu--660 B.C.--is taken for a basis, and\r\nthus the Occidental year 1910 becomes the 2570th year of the Japanese\r\ndynasty. With such methods of reckoning some collateral evidence is\r\nneeded before accepting any of the dates given in Japanese annals.\r\nKaempfer and even Rein were content to endorse the chronology of the\r\nChronicles--the Records avoid dates altogether--but other Occidental\r\nscholars* have with justice been more sceptical, and their doubts\r\nhave been confirmed by several eminent Japanese historians in recent\r\ntimes. Where, then, is collateral evidence to be found?\r\n\r\n*Notably Bramsen, Aston, Satow, and Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of Chinese and Korean history. There is, of course, no\r\ninherent reason for attributing to Korean history accuracy superior\r\nto that of Japanese history. But in China the habit of continuously\r\ncompiling written annals had been practised for many centuries before\r\nJapanese events began even to furnish materials for romantic\r\nrecitations, and no serious errors have been proved against Chinese\r\nhistoriographers during the periods when comparison with Japanese\r\nannals is feasible. In Korea's case, too, verification is partially\r\npossible. Thus, during the first five centuries of the Christian era,\r\nChinese annals contain sixteen notices of events in Korea. If Korean\r\nhistory be examined as to these events, it is found to agree in ten\r\ninstances, to disagree in two, and to be silent in four.* This record\r\ntends strongly to confirm the accuracy of the Korean annals, and it\r\nis further to be remembered that the Korean peninsula was divided\r\nduring many centuries into three principalities whose records serve\r\nas mutual checks. Finally, Korean historians do not make any such\r\ndemand upon our credulity as the Japanese do in the matter of length\r\nof sovereigns' reigns. For example, while the number of successions\r\nto the throne of Japan during the first four centuries of the\r\nChristian era is set down as seven only, making fifty-six years the\r\naverage duration of a reign, the corresponding numbers for the three\r\nKorean principalities are sixteen, seventeen, and sixteen,\r\nrespectively, making the average length of a reign from twenty-four\r\nto twenty-five years. It is, indeed, a very remarkable fact that\r\nwhereas the average age of the first seventeen Emperors of Japan, who\r\nare supposed to have reigned from 660 B.C. down to A.D. 399, was 109\r\nyears, this incredible habit of longevity ceased abruptly from the\r\nbeginning of the fifth century, the average age of the next seventeen\r\nhaving been only sixty-one and a half years; and it is a most\r\nsuggestive coincidence that the year A.D. 461 is the first date of\r\nthe accepted Japanese chronology which is confirmed by Korean\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n*Aston's essay on Early Japanese History\r\n\r\nIn fact, the conclusion is almost compulsory that Japanese authentic\r\nhistory, so far as dates are concerned, begins from the fifth\r\ncentury. Chinese annals, it is true, furnish one noteworthy and much\r\nearlier confirmation of Japanese records. They show that Japan was\r\nruled by a very renowned queen during the first half of the third\r\ncentury of the Christian era, and it was precisely at that epoch that\r\nthe Empress Jingo is related by Japanese history to have made herself\r\ncelebrated at home and abroad. Chinese historiographers, however, put\r\nJingo's death in the year A.D. 247, whereas Japanese annalists give\r\nthe date as 269. Indeed there is reason to think that just at this\r\ntime--second half of the third century--some special causes operated\r\nto disturb historical coherence in Japan, for not only does Chinese\r\nhistory refer to several signal events in Japan which find no place\r\nin the latter's records, but also Korean history indicates that the\r\nJapanese dates of certain cardinal incidents err by exactly 120\r\nyears. Two cycles in the sexagenary system of reckoning constitute\r\n120 years, and the explanation already given makes it easy to\r\nconceive the dropping of that length of time by recorders having only\r\ntradition to guide them.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, whatever may be said as to the events of early Japanese\r\nhistory, its dates can not be considered trustworthy before the\r\nbeginning of the fifth century. There is evidently one other point to\r\nbe considered in this context; namely, the introduction of writing.\r\nShould it appear that the time when the Japanese first began to\r\npossess written records coincides with the time when, according to\r\nindependent research, the dates given in their annals begin to\r\nsynchronize with those of Chinese and Korean history, another very\r\nimportant landmark will be furnished. There, is such synchronism, but\r\nit is obtained at the cost of considerations which cannot be lightly\r\ndismissed. For, although it is pretty clearly established that an\r\nevent which occured at the beginning of the fifth century preluded\r\nthe general study of the Chinese language in Japan and may not\r\nunreasonably be supposed to have led to the use of the Chinese script\r\nin compiling historical records, still it is even more clearly\r\nestablished that from a much remoter era Japan had been on terms of\r\nsome intimacy with her neighbours, China and Korea, and had exchanged\r\nwritten communications with them, so that the art of writing was\r\nassuredly known to her long before the fifth century of the Christian\r\nera, to whatever services she applied it. This subject will present\r\nitself again for examination in more convenient circumstances.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: YUKIMIDORO (Style of Stone Lantern used in Japanese\r\nGardens)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"YATSUHASHI\" STYLE OF GARDEN BRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJAPANESE MYTHOLOGY\r\n\r\nKAMI\r\n\r\nTHE mythological page of a country's history has an interest of its\r\nown apart from legendary relations; it affords indications of the\r\npeople's creeds and furnishes traces of the nation's genesis. In\r\nJapan's mythology there is a special difficulty for the\r\ninterpreter--a difficulty of nomenclature. It has been the constant\r\nhabit of foreign writers of Japan's story to speak of an \"Age of\r\nGods\" (Kami no yo). But the Japanese word Kami* does not necessarily\r\nconvey any such meaning. It has no divine import. We shall presently\r\nfind that of the hundreds of families into which Japanese society\r\ncame to be divided, each had its Kami, and that he was nothing more\r\nthan the head of the household. Fifty years ago, the Government was\r\ncommonly spoken of as O Kami (the Honourable Head), and a feudatory\r\nfrequently had the title of Kami of such and such a locality. Thus to\r\ntranslate Kami by \"deity\" or \"god\" is misleading, and as the English\r\nlanguage furnishes no exact equivalent, the best plan is to adhere to\r\nthe original expression. That plan is adopted in the following brief\r\nsummary of Japanese mythology.\r\n\r\n*Much stress is laid upon the point by that most accurate scholar,\r\nMr. B. H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nCOSMOGONY\r\n\r\nJapanese mythology opens at the beginning of \"the heaven and the\r\nearth.\" But it makes no attempt to account for the origin of things.\r\nIt introduces us at once to a \"plain of high heaven,\" the dwelling\r\nplace of these invisible* Kami, one of whom is the great central\r\nbeing, and the other two derive their titles from their productive\r\nattributes. But as to what they produced or how they produced it, no\r\nspecial indication is given. Thereafter two more Kami are born from\r\nan elementary reedlike substance that sprouts on an inchoate earth.\r\nThis is the first reference to organic matter. The two newly born\r\nKami are invisible like their predecessors, and like them are not\r\nrepresented as taking any part in the creation. They are solitary,\r\nunseeable, and functionless, but the evident idea is that they have a\r\nmore intimate connexion with cosmos than the Kami who came previously\r\ninto existence, for one of them is named after the reed-shoot from\r\nwhich he emanated, and to the other is attributed the property of\r\nstanding eternally in the heavens.\r\n\r\n*The expression here translated \"invisible\" has been interpreted in\r\nthe sense that the Kami \"hid their persons,\" i.e., died, but the true\r\nmeaning seems to be that they were invisible.\r\n\r\nUp to this point there has not been any suggestion of measuring time.\r\nBut now the record begins to speak of \"generations.\" Two more\r\nsolitary and invisible beings are born, one called the Kami who\r\nstands eternally on earth, the other the \"abundant integrator.\" Each\r\nof these represents a generation, and it will be observed that up to\r\nthis time no direct mention whatever is made of sex. Now, however,\r\nfive generations ensue, each consisting of two Kami, a male and a\r\nfemale, and thus the epithet \"solitary\" as applied to the first seven\r\nKami becomes intelligible. All these generations are represented as\r\ngradually approximating to the exercise of creative functions, for\r\nthe names* become more and more suggestive of earthly relations. The\r\nlast couple, forming the fifth generation, are Izanagi and Izanami,\r\nappellations signifying the male Kami of desire and the female Kami\r\nof desire. By all the other Kami these two are commissioned to \"make,\r\nconsolidate, and give birth to the drifting land,\" a jewelled spear\r\nbeing given to them as a token of authority, and a floating bridge\r\nbeing provided to carry them to earth. Izanagi and Izanami thrust the\r\nspear downwards and stir the \"brine\" beneath, with the result that it\r\ncoagulates, and, dropping from the spear's point, forms the first of\r\nthe Japanese islands, Onogoro. This island they take as the basis of\r\ntheir future operations, and here they beget, by ordinary human\r\nprocesses--which are described without any reservations--first, \"a\r\ngreat number of islands, and next, a great number of Kami.\" It is\r\nrelated that the first effort of procreation was not successful, the\r\noutcome being a leechlike abortion and an island of foam, the former\r\nof which was sent adrift in a boat of reeds. The islands afterwards\r\ncreated form a large part of Japan, but between these islands and the\r\nKami, begotten in succession to them, no connexion is traceable. In\r\nseveral cases the names of the Kami seem to be personifications of\r\nnatural objects. Thus we have the Kami of the \"wind's breath,\" of the\r\nsea, of the rivers, of the \"water-gates\" (estuaries and ports), of\r\nautumn, of \"foam-calm,\" of \"bubbling waves,\" of \"water-divisions,\" of\r\ntrees, of mountains, of moors, of valleys, etc. But with very rare\r\nexceptions, all these Kami have no subsequent share in the scheme of\r\nthings and cannot be regarded as evidence that the Japanese were\r\nnature worshippers.\r\n\r\n*The Kami of mud-earth; the Kami of germ-integration; the Kami of the\r\ngreat place; the Kami of the perfect exterior, etc.\r\n\r\nA change of method is now noticeable. Hitherto the process of\r\nproduction has been creative; henceforth the method is transformation\r\npreceded by destruction. Izanami dies in giving birth to the Kami of\r\nfire, and her body is disintegrated into several beings, as the male\r\nand female Kami of metal mountains, the male and female Kami of\r\nviscid clay, the female Kami of abundant food, and the Kami of youth;\r\nwhile from the tears of Izanagi as he laments her decease is born the\r\nfemale Kami of lamentation. Izanagi then turns upon the child, the\r\nKami of fire, which has cost Izanami her life, and cuts off its head;\r\nwhereupon are born from the blood that stains his sword and spatters\r\nthe rocks eight Kami, whose names are all suggestive of the violence\r\nthat called them into existence. An equal number of Kami, all having\r\nsway over mountains, are born from the head and body of the\r\nslaughtered child.\r\n\r\nAt this point an interesting episode is recorded. Izanagi visits the\r\n\"land of night,\" with the hope of recovering his spouse.* He urges\r\nher to return, as the work in which they were engaged is not yet\r\ncompleted. She replies that, unhappily having already eaten within\r\nthe portals of the land of night, she may not emerge without the\r\npermission of the Kami** of the underworld, and she conjures him,\r\nwhile she is seeking that permission, not to attempt to look on her\r\nface. He, however, weary of waiting, breaks off one of the large\r\nteeth of the comb that holds his hair*** and, lighting it, uses it as\r\na torch. He finds Izanami's body in a state of putrefaction, and amid\r\nthe decaying remains eight Kami of thunder have been born and are\r\ndwelling. Izanagi, horrified, turns and flees, but Izanami, enraged\r\nthat she has been \"put to shame,\" sends the \"hideous hag of hades\" to\r\npursue him. He obtains respite twice; first by throwing down his\r\nhead-dress, which is converted into grapes, and then casting away his\r\ncomb, which is transformed into bamboo sprouts, and while the hag\r\nstops to eat these delicacies, he flees. Then Izanami sends in his\r\npursuit the eight Kami of thunder with fifteen hundred warriors of\r\nthe underworld.**** He holds them off for a time by brandishing his\r\nsword behind him, and finally, on reaching the pass from the nether\r\nto the upper world, he finds three peaches growing there with which\r\nhe pelts his pursuers and drives them back. The peaches are rewarded\r\nwith the title of \"divine fruit,\" and entrusted with the duty of\r\nthereafter helping all living people***** in the central land of\r\n\"reed plains\"****** as they have helped Izanagi.\r\n\r\n*It is unnecessary to comment upon the identity of this incident with\r\nthe legend of Orpheus and Eurydice.\r\n\r\n**It will be observed that we hear of these Kami now for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n***This is an obvious example of a charge often preferred against the\r\ncompilers of the Records that they inferred the manners and customs\r\nof remote antiquity from those of their own time.\r\n\r\n****Again we have here evidence that the story of creation, as told\r\nin the Records, is not supposed to be complete. It says nothing as to\r\nhow the denizens of the underworld came into existence.\r\n\r\n*****The first mention of human beings.\r\n\r\n******This epithet is given to Japan.\r\n\r\nThis curious legend does not end here. Finding that the hag of hades,\r\nthe eight Kami of thunder, and the fifteen hundred warriors have all\r\nbeen repulsed, Izanami herself goes in pursuit. But her way is\r\nblocked by a huge rock which Izanagi places in the \"even pass of\r\nhades,\" and from the confines of the two worlds the angry pair\r\nexchange messages of final separation, she threatening to kill a\r\nthousand folk daily in his land if he repeats his acts of violence,\r\nand he declaring that, in such event, he will retaliate by causing\r\nfifteen hundred to be born.\r\n\r\nIn all this, no mention whatever is found of the manner in which\r\nhuman beings come into existence: they make their appearance upon the\r\nscene as though they were a primeval part of it. Izanagi, whose\r\nreturn to the upper world takes place in southwestern Japan,* now\r\ncleanses himself from the pollution he has incurred by contact with\r\nthe dead, and thus inaugurates the rite of purification practised to\r\nthis day in Japan. The Records describe minutely the process of his\r\nunrobing before entering a river, and we learn incidentally that he\r\nwore a girdle, a skirt, an upper garment, trousers, a hat, bracelets\r\non each arm, and a necklace, but no mention is made of footgear.\r\nTwelve Kami are born from these various articles as he discards them,\r\nbut without exception these additions to Japanese mythology seem to\r\nhave nothing to do with the scheme of the universe: their titles\r\nappear to be wholly capricious, and apart from figuring once upon the\r\npages of the Records they have no claim to notice. The same may be\r\nsaid of eleven among fourteen Kami thereafter born from the pollution\r\nwhich Izanagi washes off in a river.\r\n\r\n*At Himuka in Kyushu, then called Tsukushi.\r\n\r\nBut the last three of these newly created beings act a prominent part\r\nin the sequel of the story. They are the \"heaven-shining Kami\"\r\n(Amaterasu-o-mi-Kami), commonly spoken of as the \"goddess of the\r\nSun;\" the Kami of the Moon, and the Kami of force.* Izanagi expresses\r\nmuch satisfaction at the begetting of these three. He hands his\r\nnecklace to the Kami of the Sun and commissions her to rule the\r\n\"plain of heaven;\" he confers upon the Kami of the Moon the dominion\r\nof night, and he appoints the Kami of force (Susanoo) to rule the\r\nsea-plain. The Kami of the Sun and the Kami of the Moon proceed at\r\nonce to their appointed task, but the Kami of force, though of mature\r\nage and wearing a long beard, neglects his duty and falls to weeping,\r\nwailing, and fuming. Izanagi inquires the cause of his discontent,\r\nand the disobedient Kami replies that he prefers death to the office\r\nassigned him; whereupon he is forbidden to dwell in the same land\r\nwith Izanagi and has to make his abode in Omi province. Then he forms\r\nthe idea of visiting the \"plain of high heaven\" to bid farewell to\r\nhis sister, the goddess of the Sun.\r\n\r\n*Mr. Chamberlain translates the title of this Kami \"brave, swift,\r\nimpetuous, male, augustness.\"\r\n\r\nBut his journey is attended with such a shaking of mountains and\r\nseething of rivers that the goddess, informed of his recalcitrancy\r\nand distrusting his purpose, makes preparations to receive him in\r\nwarlike guise, by dressing her hair in male fashion (i.e. binding it\r\ninto knots), by tying up her skirt into the shape of trousers, by\r\nwinding a string of five hundred curved jewels round her head and\r\nwrists, by slinging on her back two quivers containing a thousand\r\narrows and five hundred arrows respectively, by drawing a guard on\r\nher left forearm, and by providing herself with a bow and a sword.\r\n\r\nThe Records and the Chronicles agree in ascribing to her such an\r\nexercise of resolute force that she stamps her feet into the ground\r\nas though it had been soft snow and scatters the earth about.\r\nSusanoo, however, disavows all evil intentions, and agrees to prove\r\nhis sincerity by taking an oath and engaging in a Kami-producing\r\ncompetition, the condition being that if his offspring be female, the\r\nfact shall bear condemnatory import, but if male, the verdict shall\r\nbe in his favour. For the purpose of this trial, they stand on\r\nopposite sides of a river (the Milky Way). Susanoo hands his sword to\r\nAmaterasu-o-mi-Kami, who breaks it into three pieces, chews the\r\nfragments, and blowing them from her mouth, produces three female\r\nKami. She then lends her string of five hundred jewels to Susanoo\r\nand, he, in turn, crunches them in his mouth and blows out the\r\nfragments which are transformed into five male Kami. The beings thus\r\nstrangely produced have comparatively close connexions with the\r\nmundane scheme, for the three female Kami--euphoniously designated\r\nKami of the torrent mist, Kami of the beautiful island, and Kami of\r\nthe cascade--become tutelary goddesses of the shrines in Chikuzen\r\nprovince (or the sacred island Itsuku-shima), and two of the male\r\nKami become ancestors of seven and twelve families, respectively, of\r\nhereditary nobles.\r\n\r\nOn the \"high plain of heaven,\" however, trouble is not allayed. The\r\nSun goddess judges that since female Kami were produced from the\r\nfragments of Susanoo's sword and male Kami from her own string of\r\njewels, the test which he himself proposed has resulted in his\r\nconviction; but he, repudiating that verdict, proceeds to break down\r\nthe divisions of the rice-fields laid out by the goddess, to fill up\r\nthe ditches, and to defile the palace--details which suggest either\r\nthat, according to Japanese tradition, heaven has its agriculture and\r\narchitecture just as earth has, or that the \"plain of high heaven\"\r\nwas really the name of a place in the Far East. The Sun goddess makes\r\nvarious excuses for her brother's lawless conduct, but he is not to\r\nbe placated. His next exploit is to flay a piebald horse and throw it\r\nthrough a hole which he breaks in the roof of the hall where the\r\ngoddess is weaving garments for the Kami. In the alarm thus created,\r\nthe goddess* is wounded by her shuttle, whereupon she retires into a\r\ncave and places a rock at the entrance, so that darkness falls upon\r\nthe \"plain of high heaven\" and upon the islands of Japan,** to the\r\nconsternation of the Kami of evil, whose voices are heard like the\r\nbuzzing of swarms of flies.\r\n\r\n*According to the Records, it is the attendants of the goddess that\r\nsuffer injury.\r\n\r\n**Referring to this episode, Aston writes in his Nihongi:\r\n\"Amaterasu-o-mi-Kami is throughout the greater part of this narrative\r\nan anthropomorphic deity, with little that is specially\r\ncharacteristic of her solar functions. Here, however, it is plainly\r\nthe sun itself which witholds its light and leaves the world to\r\ndarkness. This inconsistency, which has greatly exercised the native\r\ntheologians, is not peculiar to Japanese myth.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows a scene perhaps the most celebrated in all the\r\nmythological legends; a scene which was the origin of the sacred\r\ndance in Japan and which furnished to artists in later ages a\r\nfrequent motive. The \"eight hundred myriads\" of Kami--so numerous\r\nhave the denizens of the \"plain of high heaven\" unaccountably\r\nbecome--assemble in the bed of the \"tranquil river\"* to confer about\r\na means of enticing the goddess from her retirement. They entrust the\r\nduty of forming a plan to the Kami of \"thought combination,\" now\r\nheard of for the first time as a son of one of the two producing\r\nKami, who, with the \"great central\" Kami, constituted the original\r\ntrinity of heavenly denizens. This deity gathers together a number of\r\nbarn-yard fowl to signal sunrise, places the Kami of the \"strong arm\"\r\nat the entrance of the cave into which the goddess has retired,\r\nobtains iron from the \"mines of heaven\" and causes it to be forged\r\ninto an \"eight-foot\" mirror, appoints two Kami to procure from Mount\r\nKagu a \"five-hundred branched\" sakaki tree (cleyera Japonica), from\r\nwhose branches the mirror together with a \"five-hundred beaded\"\r\nstring of curved jewels and blue and white streamers of hempen cloth\r\nand paper-mulberry cloth are suspended, and causes divination to be\r\nperformed with the shoulder blade of a stag.\r\n\r\n*The Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThen, while a grand liturgy is recited, the \"heaven-startling\" Kami,\r\nhaving girdled herself with moss, crowned her head with a wreath of\r\nspindle-tree leaves and gathered a bouquet of bamboo grass, mounts\r\nupon a hollow wooden vessel and dances, stamping so that the wood\r\nresounds and reciting the ten numerals repeatedly. Then the\r\n\"eight-hundred myriad\" Kami laugh in unison, so that the \"plain of\r\nhigh heaven\" shakes with the sound, and the Sun goddess, surprised\r\nthat such gaiety should prevail in her absence, looks out from the\r\ncave to ascertain the cause. She is taunted by the dancer, who tells\r\nher that a greater than she is present, and the mirror being thrust\r\nbefore her, she gradually comes forward, gazing into it with\r\nastonishment; whereupon the Kami of the \"strong arm\" grasps her hand\r\nand drags her out, while two other Kami* stretch behind her a rope\r\nmade of straw, pulled up by the roots,** to prevent her return, and\r\nsunshine once more floods the \"plain of high heaven.\"\r\n\r\n*These two are the ancestors of the Kami of the Nakatomi and the\r\nImibe hereditary corporations, who may be described as the high\r\npriests of the indigenous cult of Japan.\r\n\r\n**This kind of rope called shime-nawa, an abbreviation of\r\nshiri-kume-nawa may be seen festooning the portals of any Shinto\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\nThe details of this curious legend deserve attention for the sake of\r\ntheir close relation to the observances of the Shinto cult. Moreover,\r\nthe mythology now takes a new departure. At the time of Izanagi's\r\nreturn from hades, vague reference is made to human beings, but after\r\nSusanoo's departure from the \"plain of high heaven,\" he is\r\nrepresented as holding direct converse with them. There is an\r\ninterlude which deals with the foodstuffs of mortals. Punished with a\r\nfine of a great number of tables* of votive offerings, his beard cut\r\noff, and the nails of his fingers and toes pulled out, Susanoo is\r\nsentenced to expulsion from heaven. He seeks sustenance from the Kami\r\nof food, and she responds by taking from the orifices of her body\r\nvarious kinds of viands which she offers to him. But he, deeming\r\nhimself insulted, kills her, whereupon from her corpse are born rice,\r\nmillet, small and large beans, and barley. These are taken by one of\r\nthe two Kami of production, and by him they are caused to be used as\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n*The offerings of food in religious services were always placed upon\r\nsmall, low tables.\r\n\r\nThereafter Susanoo descends to a place at the headwaters of the river\r\nHi (Izumo province). Seeing a chop-stick float down the stream, he\r\ninfers the existence of people higher up the river, and going in\r\nsearch of them, finds an old man and an old woman lamenting over and\r\ncaressing a girl. The old man says that he is an earthly Kami, son of\r\nthe Kami of mountains, who was one of the thirty-five Kami borne by\r\nIzanami before her departure for hades. He explains that he had\r\noriginally eight daughters, but that every year an eight-forked\r\nserpent has come from the country of Koshi and devoured one of the\r\nmaidens, so that there remains only Lady Wonderful, whose time to\r\nshare her sisters' fate is now at hand. It is a huge monster,\r\nextending over eight valleys and eight hills, its eyes red like\r\nwinter cherries, its belly bloody and inflamed, and its back\r\novergrown with moss and conifers. Susanoo, having announced himself\r\nas the brother of the Sun goddess, receives Lady Wonderful and at\r\nonce transforms her into a comb which he places in his hair. He then\r\ninstructs the old man and his wife to build a fence with eight gates,\r\nplacing in every gate a vat of rice wine.\r\n\r\nPresently the serpent arrives, drinks the wine, and laying down its\r\nheads to sleep, is cut to pieces by Susanoo with his ten-span sabre.\r\nIn the body of the serpent the hero finds a sword, \"great and sharp,\"\r\nwhich he sends to the Sun goddess, at whose shrine in Ise it is\r\nsubsequently found and given to the famous warrior, Yamato-dake, when\r\nhe is setting out on his expedition against the Kumaso of the north.\r\nThe sword is known as the \"Herb-queller.\" Susanoo then builds for\r\nhimself and Lady Wonderful a palace at Suga in Izumo, and composes a\r\ncelebrated verse of Japanese poetry.* Sixth in descent from the\r\noffspring of this union is the \"Kami of the great land,\" called also\r\nthe \"Great-Name Possessor,\" or the \"Kami of the reed plains,\" or the\r\n\"Kami of the eight thousand spears,\" or the \"Kami of the great land\r\nof the living,\" the last name being antithetical to Susanoo's title\r\nof \"Ruler of Hades.\"\r\n\r\n*\"Many clouds arise,\r\nOn all sides a manifold fence,\r\nTo receive within it the spouse,\r\nThey form a manifold fence\r\nAh! that manifold fence.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral legends are attached to the name of this multinominal\r\nbeing--legends in part romantic, in part supernatural, and in part\r\nfabulous. His eighty brethren compel him to act as their servant when\r\nthey go to seek the hand of Princess Yakami of Inaba. But on the way\r\nhe succours a hare which they have treated brutally and the little\r\nanimal promises that he, not they, shall win the princess, though he\r\nis only their baggage-bearer. Enraged at the favour she shows him,\r\nthey seek in various ways to destroy him: first by rolling down on\r\nhim from a mountain a heated rock; then by wedging him into the cleft\r\nof a tree, and finally by shooting him. But he is saved by his\r\nmother, and takes refuge in the province of Kii (the Land of Trees)\r\nat the palace of the \"Kami of the great house.\"* Acting on the\r\nlatter's advice, he visits his ancestor, Susanoo, who is now in\r\nhades, and seeks counsel as to some means of overcoming his eighty\r\nenemies. But instead of helping him, that unruly Kami endeavours to\r\ncompass his death by thrusting him into a snake-house; by putting him\r\ninto a nest of centipedes and wasps, and finally by shooting an arrow\r\ninto a moor, sending him to seek it and then setting fire to the\r\ngrass. He is saved from the first two perils through the agency of\r\nmiraculous scarves given to him by Princess Forward, Susanoo's\r\ndaughter, who has fallen in love with him; and from the last dilemma\r\na mouse instructs him how to emerge.\r\n\r\n*A son of Susanoo. Under the name of Iso-Takeru he is recorded to\r\nhave brought with him a quantity of seeds of trees and shrubs, which\r\nhe planted, not in Korea, but in Tsukushi (Kyushu) and the eight\r\nislands of Japan. These words \"not in Korea\" are worthy of note, as\r\nwill presently be appreciated.\r\n\r\nA curious episode concludes this recital: Susanoo requires that the\r\nparasites shall be removed from his head by his visitor. These\r\nparasites are centipedes, but the Great-Name Possessor, again acting\r\nunder the instruction of Princess Forward, pretends to be removing\r\nthe centipedes, whereas he is in reality spitting out a mixture of\r\nberries and red earth. Susanoo falls asleep during the process, and\r\nthe Great-Name Possessor binds the sleeping Kami's hair to the\r\nrafters of the house, places a huge rock at the entrance, seizes\r\nSusanoo's life-preserving sword and life-preserving bow and arrows as\r\nalso his sacred lute,* and taking Princess Forward on his back,\r\nflees. The lute brushes against a tree, and its sound rouses Susanoo.\r\nBut before he can disentangle his hair from the rafters, the\r\nfugitives reach the confines of the underworld, and the enraged Kami,\r\nwhile execrating this visitor who has outwitted him, is constrained\r\nto direct him how to overcome his brethren and to establish his rule\r\nfirmly. In all this he succeeds, and having married Princess Yakami,\r\nto whom he was previously engaged,** he resumes the work left\r\nunfinished by Izanagi and Izanami, the work of \"making the land.\"\r\n\r\n*Sacred because divine revelations were supposed to be made through a\r\nlute-player.\r\n\r\n**In the story of this Kami, we find the first record of conjugal\r\njealousy in Japan. Princess Forward strongly objects to her husband's\r\nexcursions into novel fields.\r\n\r\nThe exact import of this process, \"making the land,\" is not\r\ndiscernible. In the hands of Izanagi and Izanami it resolves itself\r\ninto begetting, first, a number of islands and, then, a number of\r\nKami. At the outset it seems to have no more profound significance\r\nfor the Great-Name Possessor. Several generations of Kami are\r\nbegotten by him, but their names give no indication of the parts they\r\nare supposed to have taken in the \"making of the land.\" They are all\r\nborn in Japan, however, and it is perhaps significant that among them\r\nthe one child--the Kami of wells--brought forth by Princess Yakami,\r\nis not included. Princess Forward has no children, a fact which\r\ndoubtless augments her jealousy of her husband's amours; jealousy\r\nexpressed in verses that show no mean poetic skill. Thus, the\r\nGreat-Name Possessor on the eve of a journey from Izumo to Yamato,\r\nsings as he stands with one hand on his saddle and one foot in the\r\nstirrup:--\r\n\r\n   Though thou sayest thou willst not weep\r\n   If like the flocking birds, I flock and depart,\r\n   If like the led birds, I am led away and\r\n   Depart; thou wilt hang down thine head like\r\n   A single Eulalia upon the mountain and\r\n   Thy weeping shall indeed rise as the mist of\r\n   The morning shower.\r\n   Then the Empress, taking a wine-cup, approaches and offers it to\r\n      him, saying:\r\n   Oh! Thine Augustness, the Deity-of-Eight-Thousand-Spears!\r\n   Thou, my dear Master-of-the-Great-Land indeed,\r\n   Being a man, probably hast on the various island headlands thou\r\n      seest,\r\n   And on every beach-headland that thou lookest on,\r\n   A wife like the young herbs. But as for me, alas!\r\n   Being a woman, I have no man except thee; I have no spouse except\r\n      thee.\r\n   Beneath the fluttering of the ornamented fence,\r\n   Beneath the softness of the warm coverlet,\r\n   Beneath the rustling of the cloth coverlet,\r\n   Thine arms, white as rope of paper-mulberry bark softly patting\r\n      my breast soft as the melting snow,\r\n   And patting each other interlaced, stretching out and pillowing\r\n      ourselves on each other's arms,\r\n   True jewel arms, and with outstretched legs, will we sleep.*\r\n\r\n   *B. H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus sung, they at once pledged each other by the cup with\r\ntheir hands on each other's necks.\" It is, nevertheless, from among\r\nthe children born on the occasion of the contest between the Sun\r\ngoddess and Susanoo that the Great-Name Possessor first seeks a\r\nspouse--the Princess of the Torrent Mist--to lay the foundation of\r\nfifteen generations of Kami, whose birth seems to have been essential\r\nto the \"making of the land,\" though their names afford no clue to the\r\nfunctions discharged by them. From over sea, seated in a gourd and\r\nwearing a robe of wren's feathers, there comes a pigmy, Sukuna\r\nHikona, who proves to be one of fifteen hundred children begotten by\r\nthe Kami of the original trinity. Skilled in the arts of healing\r\nsickness and averting calamities from men or animals, this pigmy\r\nrenders invaluable aid to the Great-Name Possessor. But the useful\r\nlittle Kami does not wait to witness the conclusion of the work of\r\n\"making and consolidating the country.\" Before its completion he\r\ntakes his departure from Cape Kumano in Izumo to the \"everlasting\r\nland\"--a region commonly spoken of in ancient Japanese annals but not\r\nyet definitely located. He is replaced by a spirit whose coming is\r\nthus described by the Chronicles:\r\n\r\nAfter this (i.e. the departure of Sukuna), wherever there was in the\r\nland a part which was imperfect, the Great-Name Possessor visited it\r\nby himself and succeeded in repairing it. Coming at last to the\r\nprovince of Izumo, he spake and said: \"This central land of reed\r\nplains had always been waste and wild. The very rocks, trees, and\r\nhuts were all given to violence... But I have now reduced it to\r\nsubmission, and there is none that is not compliant.\" Therefore he\r\nsaid finally: \"It is I, and I alone, who now govern this land. Is\r\nthere, perchance, anyone who could join with me in governing the\r\nworld?\" Upon this a divine radiance illuminated the sea, and of a\r\nsudden there was something which floated towards him and said: \"Were\r\nI not here, how couldst thou subdue this land? It is because I am\r\nhere that thou hast been enabled to accomplish this mighty\r\nundertaking.\" Then the Great-Name Possessor inquired, saying, \"Then\r\nwho art thou?\" It replied and said: \"I am thy guardian spirit, the\r\nwonderous spirit.\" Then said the Great-Name Possessor: \"True, I know\r\ntherefore that thou art my guardian spirit, the wonderous spirit.\r\nWhere dost thou now wish to dwell?\" The spirit answered and said, \"I\r\nwish to dwell on Mount Mimoro in the province of Yamato.\" Accordingly\r\nhe built a shrine in that place and made the spirit go and dwell\r\nthere. This is the Kami of Omiwa.*\r\n\r\n*Aston's Translation of the Nihongi.\r\n\r\nAfter the above incident, another begetting of Kami takes place on a\r\nlarge scale, but only a very few of them--such as the guardian of the\r\nkitchen, the protector of house-entrances, the Kami of agriculture,\r\nand so forth--have any intelligible place in the scheme of things.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: CRESTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nJAPANESE MYTHOLOGY (Continued)\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJUGATION OF JAPAN\r\n\r\nTHE dividing line between mythological tradition and historical\r\nlegend is now reached. It will have been observed that, after the\r\ndescent of Susanoo, the Kami on the \"plain of high heaven\" took no\r\nfurther part in \"making\" or \"ruling\" the \"ever fruitful land of\r\nreed-covered moors, and luxuriant rice-fields,\" as Japan was called.\r\nEverything was left in the hands of Susanoo, the insubordinate Kami,\r\nwho had been expelled from heaven for his destructive violence. His\r\ndescendant in the sixth generation, the Great-Name Possessor, now\r\nheld supreme sway over the islands, in conjunction with a number of\r\nhis own relations, his seat of power being in the province of Izumo.\r\nAt this juncture the goddess of the Sun decided that a sovereign\r\nshould be sent down to govern the land of many islands, and she chose\r\nfor this purpose the son of the eldest* of the five Kami born from\r\nher necklace during the procreation competition with Susanoo.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, however, it was considered necessary to reduce\r\nthe country to order, observation having shown it to be in a state of\r\ntumult. For that purpose the second of the five necklace\r\nKami--considered \"the most heroic\" of all the beings on the \"plain of\r\nhigh heaven\"--was despatched. But he \"curried favour\" with the\r\nGreat-Name Possessor and took up his abode in Japan. At the end of\r\nthree years,** seeing that he had not returned, it was decided by the\r\nKami in council to send another envoy, the Heavenly Young Prince. But\r\nhe proved even more disloyal, for he married the daughter of the\r\nGreat-Name Possessor, famous for her beauty,*** and planning to\r\nsucceed his father-in-law as sovereign of the land, remained in Izumo\r\nfor eight years. A third conclave of the Kami was now convened by the\r\nSun goddess and her coadjutor, the Great-Producing Kami,* and they\r\ndecided to despatch a pheasant to make observations.\r\n\r\n*This Kami married a daughter of one of the two Great-Producing Kami\r\nwho belonged to the original trinity, and who co-operates with the\r\nSun goddess throughout.\r\n\r\n**This is the first mention of a measure of time in the Records.\r\n\r\n***She was called Princess Undershining, because her beauty shone\r\nthrough her raiment.\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and lit on a cassia tree at the gate of the\r\nHeavenly Young Prince's dwelling, whereupon the prince, at the\r\ninstigation of a female spy, taking a bow given to him originally by\r\nthe Great-Producing Kami, shot a shaft which pierced the bird's bosom,\r\nand, reaching the Milky Way where sat the Sun goddess and the\r\nGreat-Producing Kami, was recognized by the latter, who threw it back\r\nto earth, decreeing that it should strike the prince were he guilty\r\nof treason, and leave him unharmed if the blood on the arrow was that\r\nof the earthly Kami whom he had been sent to quell. The shaft struck\r\nthe prince and killed him.\r\n\r\nAt this point the course of the history is interrupted by an\r\nunintelligible description of the resulting obsequies--held in heaven\r\naccording to the Chronicles, on earth according to the Records. Wild\r\ngeese, herons, kingfishers, sparrows, and pheasants were the\r\nprincipal officiators; the mourning rites, which included singing,\r\nand dancing,* continued for eight days and eight nights, and the\r\nproceedings were rudely interrupted by the prince's brother-in-law,\r\nwho, coming to condole and being mistaken for the deceased, is so\r\nenraged by the error that he draws his sword, cuts down the mortuary\r\nhouse, and kicks away the pieces.\r\n\r\n*It has been conjectured, with much probability, that this singing\r\nand dancing was a ceremony in imitation of the rites performed to\r\nentice the Sun goddess from her cave. The motive was to resuscitate\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nThese two failures did not deter the Great-Producing Kami and the Sun\r\ngoddess. They again took counsel with the other beings on the \"plain\r\nof high heaven,\" and it was decided to have recourse to the Kami born\r\nfrom the blood that dropped from Izanagi's sword when he slew the\r\nKami of fire. To one of these--the Kami of courage--the mission of\r\nsubduing the land of many islands was entrusted, and associated with\r\nhim in the work was the Kami of boats, a son of Izanagi and Izanami.\r\nThe two descended to Izumo. They carried swords ten hand-breadths\r\nlong, and having planted these upside down, they seated themselves on\r\nthe points and delivered their message to the Great-Name Possessor,\r\nrequiring him to declare whether or not he would abdicate in favour\r\nof the newly named sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Great-Name Possessor replied that he must consult his son, who\r\nwas absent on a hunting expedition. Accordingly, the Kami of boats\r\nwent to seek him, and, on being conducted into his father's presence,\r\nthe latter declared his willingness to surrender, sealing the\r\ndeclaration by suicide.* There remained, then, only the second son of\r\nthe Great-Name Possessor to be consulted. He did not submit so\r\neasily. Relying on his great strength, he challenged the Kami of\r\ncourage to a trial of hand grasping. But when he touched the Kami's\r\nhand it turned first into an icicle and then into a sword-blade,\r\nwhereas his own hand, when seized by the Kami, was crushed and thrown\r\naside like a young reed. He fled away in terror, and was pursued by\r\nthe Kami as far as the distant province of Shinano, when he saved his\r\nlife by making formal submission and promising not to contravene the\r\ndecision of his father and elder brother.\r\n\r\n*He stepped on the side of his boat so as to upset it, and with hands\r\ncrossed behind his back sank into the sea.\r\n\r\nThen the Great-Name Possessor, having \"lost his sons, on whom he\r\nrelied,\" agreed to abdicate provided that a shrine were built in\r\nmemory of him, \"having its pillars made stout on the nethermost\r\nrock-bottom, and its cross-beams raised to the 'plain of high\r\nheaven.'\"* He handed over the broad-bladed spear which had assisted\r\nhim to pacify the land, and declaring that if he offered resistance,\r\nall the earthly Kami, too, would certainly resist, he \"hid in the\r\neighty road-windings.\"\r\n\r\n*This hyperbolical language illustrates the tone of the Records and\r\nthe Chronicles. Applied to the comparatively humble buildings that\r\nserved for residences in ancient Japan, the description in the text\r\nis curiously exaggerated. The phrase here quoted finds frequent\r\nreproduction in the Shinto rituals.\r\n\r\nThus, already in the eighth century when the Records and the\r\nChronicles were compiled, suicide after defeat in battle had become a\r\nrecognized practice. The submission and self-inflicted death of the\r\nGreat-Name Possessor did not, however, save his followers. All the\r\nrebellious Kami were put to the sword by the envoys from the \"plain\r\nof high heaven.\" This chapter of the annals ends with an account of\r\nthe shrine erected in memory of the Great-Name Possessor. It was\r\nplaced under the care of a grandson of the Kami born to Izanagi and\r\nIzanami, who is represented as declaring that he \"would continue\r\ndrilling fire for the Kami's kitchen until the soot hung down eight\r\nhand-breadths from the roof of the shrine of the Great-Producing Kami\r\nand until the earth below was baked to its nethermost rocks; and that\r\nwith the fire thus drilled he would cook for him the fish brought in\r\nby the fishermen, and present them to him in baskets woven of split\r\nbamboos which would bend beneath their weight.\"\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT UPON TSUKUSHI\r\n\r\nIt had been originally intended that the dominion of Japan should be\r\ngiven to the senior of the five Kami born of the five-hundred-jewel\r\nstring of the Sun goddess. But during the interval devoted to\r\nbringing the land to a state of submission, this Kami's spouse, the\r\nPrincess of the Myriad Looms of the Luxuriant Dragon-fly Island,* had\r\nborne a son, Hikoho no Ninigi, (Rice-Ears of Ruddy Plenty), and this\r\nboy having now grown to man's estate, it was decided to send him as\r\nruler of Japan. A number of Kami were attached to him as guards and\r\nassistants, among them being the Kami of \"thought combination,\" who\r\nconceived the plan for enticing the Sun goddess from her cave and who\r\noccupied the position of chief councillor in the conclave of high\r\nheaven; the female Kami who danced before the cave; the female Kami\r\nwho forged the mirror, and, in short, all the Kami who assisted in\r\nrestoring light to the world. There were also entrusted to the new\r\nsovereign the curved-jewel chaplet of the Sun goddess, the mirror\r\nthat had helped to entice her, and the sword (herb-queller) which\r\nSusanoo had taken from the body of the eight-headed serpent.\r\n\r\n*\"Dragon-fly Island\" was a name anciently given to Japan on account\r\nof the country's shape.\r\n\r\nThese three objects thenceforth became the three sacred things of\r\nJapan. Strict injunction was given that the mirror was to be regarded\r\nand reverenced exactly as though it was the spirit of the Sun\r\ngoddess, and it was ordered that the Kami of \"thought combination\"\r\nshould administer the affairs of the new kingdom. The fact is also to\r\nbe noted that among the Kami attached to Hikoho no Ninigi's person,\r\nfive--three male and two female--are designated by the Records as\r\nancestors and ancestresses of as many hereditary corporations, a\r\ndistinctive feature of the early Japan's polity. As to the manner of\r\nHikoho no Ninigi's journey to Japan, the Chronicles say that the\r\nGreat-Producing Kami threw the coverlet of his couch over him and\r\ncaused him to cleave his way downwards through the clouds; but the\r\nRecords allege that he descended \"shut up in the floating bridge of\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe point has some interest as furnishing a traditional trace of the\r\nnature of this so-called invasion of Japan, and as helping to confirm\r\nthe theory that the \"floating bridge of heaven,\" from which Izanagi\r\nthrust his spear downwards into the brine of chaos, was nothing more\r\nthan a boat. It will naturally be supposed that as Hikoho no Ninigi's\r\nmigration to Japan was in the sequel of a long campaign having its\r\nmain field in the province of Izumo, his immediate destination would\r\nhave been that province, where a throne was waiting to be occupied by\r\nhim, and where he knew that a rich region existed. But the Records\r\nand the Chronicles agree in stating that he descended on\r\nKirishimayama* in Tsukushi, which is the ancient name of the island\r\nof Kyushu. This is one of the first eight islands begotten by Izanagi\r\nand Izanami. Hence the alternative name for Japan, \"Land of the Eight\r\nGreat Islands.\"\r\n\r\n*Takachiho-dake is often spoken of as the mountain thus celebrated,\r\nbut Takachiho is only the eastern, and lower, of the two peaks of\r\nKirishima-yama.\r\n\r\nIt was, moreover, to a river of Tsukushi that Izanagi repaired to\r\ncleanse himself from the pollution of hades. But between Kyushu\r\n(Tsukushi) and Izumo the interval is immense, and it is accentuated\r\nby observing that the mountain Kirishima, specially mentioned in the\r\nstory, raises its twin peaks at the head of the Bay of Kagoshima in\r\nthe extreme south of Kyushu. There is very great difficulty in\r\nconceiving that an army whose ultimate destination was Izumo should\r\nhave deliberately embarked on the shore of Kagoshima. The landing of\r\nNinigi--his full name need not be repeated--was made with all\r\nprecautions, the van of his army (kume) being commanded by the\r\nancestor of the men who thenceforth held the highest military rank\r\n(otomo) through many centuries, and the arms carried being bows,\r\narrows, and swords.*\r\n\r\n*The swords are said to have been \"mallet-headed,\" but the term still\r\nawaits explanation.\r\n\r\nAll the annals agree in suggesting that the newcomers had no\r\nknowledge of the locality, but whereas one account makes Ninigi\r\nconsult and obtain permission from an inhabitant of the place,\r\nanother represents him as expressing satisfaction that the region lay\r\nopposite to Kara (Korea) and received the beams of the rising and the\r\nsetting sun, qualifications which it is not easy to associate with\r\nany part of southern Kyushu.\r\n\r\nAt all events he built for himself a palace in accordance with the\r\northodox formula--its pillars made stout on the nethermost\r\nrock-bottom and its cross-beams made high to the plain of heaven--and\r\napparently abandoned all idea of proceeding to Izumo. Presently he\r\nencountered a beautiful girl. She gave her name as Brilliant Blossom,\r\nand described herself as the daughter of the Kami of mountains one of\r\nthe thirty-five beings begotten by Izanagi and Izanami who would seem\r\nto have been then living in Tsukushi, and who gladly consented to\r\ngive Brilliant Blossom. He sent with her a plentiful dower--many\r\n\"tables\"* of merchandise--but he sent also her elder sister,\r\nEnduring-as-Rock, a maiden so ill favoured that Ninigi dismissed her\r\nwith disgust, thus provoking the curse of the Kami of mountains, who\r\ndeclared that had his elder daughter been welcomed, the lives of the\r\nheavenly sovereigns** would have been as long as her name suggested,\r\nbut that since she had been treated with contumely, their span of\r\nexistence would be comparatively short. Presently Brilliant Blossom\r\nbecame enceinte. Her lord, however, thinking that sufficient time had\r\nnot elapsed for such a result, suspected her of infidelity with one\r\nof the earthly Kami,*** whereupon she challenged the ordeal of fire,\r\nand building a parturition hut, passed in, plastered up the entrance,\r\nand set fire to the building. She was delivered of three children\r\nwithout mishap, and their names were Hosuseri (Fire-climax), Hohodemi\r\n(Fire-shine), and Hoori (Fire-subside).\r\n\r\n*This expression has reference to the fact that offerings at\r\nreligious ceremonials were always heaped on low tables for laying\r\nbefore the shrine.\r\n\r\n**The expression \"heavenly sovereign\" is here applied for the first\r\ntime to the Emperors of Japan.\r\n\r\n***The term \"earthly\" was applied to Kami born on earth, \"heavenly\"\r\nKami being those born in heaven.\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF THE SEA DRAGON\r\n\r\nAt this stage the annals digress to relate an episode which has only\r\ncollateral interest Hosuseri and Hohodemi made fishing and hunting,\r\nrespectively, their avocations. But Hohodemi conceived a fancy to\r\nexchange pursuits, and importuned Hosuseri to agree. When, however,\r\nthe former tried his luck at angling, he not only failed to catch\r\nanything but also lost the hook which his brother had lent him. This\r\nbecame the cause of a quarrel. Hosuseri taunted Hohodemi on the\r\nfoolishness of the original exchange and demanded the restoration of\r\nhis hook, nor would he be placated though Hohodemi forged his sabre\r\ninto five hundred hooks and then into a thousand. Wandering\r\ndisconsolate,* by the seashore, Hohodemi met the Kami of salt, who,\r\nadvising him to consult the daughter of the ocean Kami,** sent him to\r\nsea in a \"stout little boat.\"\r\n\r\n*\"Weeping and lamenting\" are the words in the Records.\r\n\r\n**One of the Kami begotten by Izanagi and Izanami.\r\n\r\nAfter drifting for a time, he found himself at a palace beside which\r\ngrew a many-branched cassia tree overhanging a well. He climbed into\r\nthe tree and waited. Presently the handmaidens of Princess Rich Gem,\r\ndaughter of the ocean Kami, came to draw water, and seeing a shadow\r\nin the well, they detected Hohodemi in the cassia tree. At his\r\nrequest they gave him water in a jewelled vessel, but instead of\r\ndrinking, he dropped into the vessel a gem from his own necklace, and\r\nthe handmaidens, unable to detach the gem, carried the vessel to\r\ntheir mistress. Then the princess went to look and, seeing a\r\nbeautiful youth in the cassia tree, \"exchanged glances\" with him. The\r\nocean Kami quickly recognized Hohodemi; led him in; seated him on a\r\npile of many layers of sealskins* overlaid by many layers of silk\r\nrugs; made a banquet for him, and gave him for wife Princess Rich\r\nGem.\r\n\r\n*Chamberlain translates this \"sea-asses' skins,\" and conjectures that\r\nsea-lions or seals may be meant.\r\n\r\nThree years passed tranquilly without the bridegroom offering any\r\nexplanation of his presence. At the end of that time, thoughts of the\r\npast visited him and he \"sighed.\" Princess Rich Gem took note of this\r\ndespondency and reported it to her father, who now, for the first\r\ntime, inquired the cause of Hohodemi's coming. Thereafter all the\r\nfishes of the sea, great and small, were summoned, and being\r\nquestioned about the lost hook, declared that the tai* had recently\r\ncomplained of something sticking in its throat and preventing it from\r\neating. So the lost hook was recovered, and the ocean Kami instructed\r\nHohodemi, when returning it to his brother, to warn the latter that\r\nit was a useless hook which would not serve its purpose, but would\r\nrather lead its possessor to ruin. He further instructed him to\r\nfollow a method of rice culture the converse of that adopted by his\r\nbrother, since he, the ocean Kami, would rule the waters so as to\r\nfavour Hohodemi's labours, and he gave him two jewels having the\r\nproperty of making the tide ebb and flow, respectively. These jewels\r\nwere to be used against Hosuseri, if necessary.\r\n\r\n*Pagrus major.\r\n\r\nFinally the Kami of the ocean instructed a crocodile to carry\r\nHohodemi to his home. This was accomplished, and in token of his safe\r\narrival, Hohodemi placed his stiletto on the crocodile's neck for\r\nconveyance to the ocean Kami.\r\n\r\nThe programme prescribed by the latter was now faithfully pursued, so\r\nthat Hosuseri grew constantly poorer, and finally organized a fierce\r\nattack upon his younger brother, who, using the tide-flowing jewel,\r\noverwhelmed his assailants until they begged for mercy, whereupon the\r\npower of the tide-ebbing jewel was invoked to save them. The result\r\nwas that Hosuseri, on behalf of himself and his descendants for all\r\ntime, promised to guard and respectfully serve his brother by day and\r\nby night. In this episode the hayabito had their origin. They were\r\npalace guards, who to their military functions added the duty of\r\noccasionally performing a dance which represented the struggles of\r\ntheir ancestor, Hosuseri, when he was in danger of drowning.\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF THE EMPEROR JIMMU\r\n\r\nAfter the composition of the quarrel described above, Princess Rich\r\nGem arrived from the castle of the ocean Kami, and built a\r\nparturition hut on the seashore, she being about to bring forth a\r\nchild. Before the thatch of cormorants' feathers could be completed,\r\nthe pains of labour overtook her, and she entered the hut, conjuring\r\nher husband not to spy upon her privacy, since, in order to be safely\r\ndelivered, she must assume a shape appropriate to her native land.\r\nHe, however, suffered his curiosity to overcome him, and peeping in,\r\nsaw her in the form of an eight-fathom crocodile. It resulted that\r\nhaving been thus put to shame, she left her child and returned to the\r\nocean Kami's palace, declaring that there should be no longer any\r\nfree passage between the dominions of the ocean Kami and the world of\r\nmen. \"Nevertheless afterwards, although angry at her husband's having\r\nwished to peep, she could not restrain her loving heart,\" and she\r\nsent her younger sister, Good Jewel, to nurse the baby and to be the\r\nbearer of a farewell song to Hohodemi.\r\n\r\nThe Records state that the latter lived to the age of 580 years and\r\nthat his mausoleum was built to the west of Mount Takachiho, on which\r\nhis palace stood. Thus for the first time the duration of a life is\r\nstated in the antique annals of Japan. His son, called Fuki-ayezu\r\n(Unfinished Thatch), in memory of the strange incident attending his\r\nbirth, married Princess Good Jewel, his own aunt, and by her had four\r\nsons. The first was named Itsuse (Five Reaches) and the youngest,\r\nIware (a village in Yamato province). This latter ultimately became\r\nEmperor of Japan, and is known in history as Jimmu (Divine Valour), a\r\nposthumous name given to him many centuries after his death.* From\r\nthe time of this sovereign dates and events are recorded with full\r\nsemblance of accuracy in the Chronicles, but the compilers of the\r\nRecords do not attempt to give more than a bald statement of the\r\nnumber of years each sovereign lived or reigned.\r\n\r\n*Posthumous names for the earthly Mikados were invented in the reign\r\nof Kwammu (A.D. 782-805), i.e., after the date of the compilation of\r\nthe Records and the Chronicles. But they are in universal use by the\r\nJapanese, though to speak of a living sovereign by his posthumous\r\nname is a manifest anomaly.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPEDITION TO YAMATO\r\n\r\nAccording to the Chronicles, the four sons of Fuki-ayezu engaged in a\r\ncelebrated expedition from Tsukushi (Kyushu) to Yamato, but one\r\nalone, the youngest, survived. According to the Records, two only\r\ntook part in the expedition, the other two having died before it set\r\nout. The former version seems more consistent with the facts, and\r\nwith the manner of the two princes' deaths, as described in the\r\nRecords. Looking from the east coast of the island of Kyushu, the\r\nprovince of Yamato lies to the northeast, at a distance of about 350\r\nmiles, and forms the centre of the Kii promontory. From what has\r\npreceded, a reader of Japanese history is prepared to find that the\r\nobjective of the expedition was Izumo, not Yamato, since it was to\r\nprepare for the occupation of the former province that the Sun\r\ngoddess and her coadjutors expended so much energy. No explanation\r\nwhatever of this discrepancy is offered, but it cannot be supposed\r\nthat Yamato was regarded as a halfway house to Izumo, seeing that\r\nthey lie on opposite coasts of Japan and are two hundred miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThe Chronicles assign the genesis of the enterprise to Prince Iware,\r\nwhom they throughout call Hohodemi, and into whose mouth they put an\r\nexhortation--obviously based on a Chinese model--speaking of a land\r\nin the east encircled by blue mountains and well situated, as the\r\ncentre of administrative authority. To reach Yamato by sea from\r\nKyushu two routes offer; one, the more direct, is by the Pacific\r\nOcean straight to the south coast of the Kii promontory; the other is\r\nby the Inland Sea to the northwestern coast of the same promontory.\r\nThe latter was chosen, doubtless because nautical knowledge and\r\nseagoing vessels were alike wanting.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, however, to speak with confidence as to the\r\nnature of the ships possessed by the Japanese in early times. The\r\nfirst mention of ships occurs in the story of Susanoo's arrival in\r\nJapan. He is said to have carried with him quantities of tree seeds\r\nwhich he planted in the Eight Island Country, the cryptomeria and the\r\ncamphor being intended to serve as \"floating riches,\" namely ships.\r\nThis would suggest, as is indeed commonly believed, that the boats of\r\nthat era were simply hollow trunks of trees.\r\n\r\nFive centuries later, however, without any intervening reference, we\r\nfind the Emperor Sujin urging the construction of ships as of\r\ncardinal importance for purposes of coastwise transport--advice which\r\nis hardly consistent with the idea of log boats. Again, in A.D. 274,\r\nthe people of Izu are recorded as having built and sent to the Court\r\na vessel one hundred feet long; and, twenty-six years later, this\r\nship having become old and unserviceable, was used as fuel for\r\nmanufacturing salt, five hundred bags of which were distributed among\r\nthe provinces with directions to construct as many ships.\r\n\r\nThere is no mention in either the Chronicles or the Records of any\r\nmarked change in the matter of marine architecture during all these\r\nyears. The nature of the Kyushu expeditionary ships must therefore\r\nremain a matter of conjecture, but that they were propelled by oars,\r\nnot sails, seems pretty certain. Setting out from some point in\r\nKyushu probably the present Kagoshima Bay the expedition made its way\r\nup the east coast of the island, and reaching the Bungo Channel,\r\nwhere the tide is very rapid, obtained the services of a fisherman as\r\npilot. Thence the fleet pushed on to Usa in the province of Buzen, at\r\nthe north of Kyushu, when two local chieftains built for the\r\nentertainment and residence of the princes and their followers a \"one\r\npillared palace\"--probably a tent. The next place of call was Oka (or\r\nOkada) in Chikuzen, where they passed a year before turning eastward\r\ninto the Inland Sea, and pushing on to one of the many islands off\r\nthe coast of Aki, they spent seven years before proceeding to another\r\nisland (Takashima) in Kibi, as the present three provinces of Bingo,\r\nBitchu, and Bizen were then called. There they delayed for eight\r\nyears the Chronicles say three--in order to repair the oars of their\r\nvessels and to procure provisions.\r\n\r\nUp to this time there had been no fighting or any attempt to effect a\r\nlodgment on the mainland. But the expedition was now approaching the\r\nnarrow westerly entrance to the present Osaka Bay, where an army\r\nmight be encountered at any moment. The boats therefore sailed in\r\nline ahead, \"the prow of each ship touching the stern of the other.\"\r\nOff the mouth of the river, now known as the Yodo, they encountered\r\nsuch a high sea that they called the place Nami-hana (Wave\r\nFlowers), a name subsequently abbreviated to Naniwa. Pushing\r\non, the expeditionary force finally landed at a place--not now\r\nidentifiable--in the province of Kawachi, which bounds Yamato on the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe whole voyage had occupied four years according to the Chronicles,\r\nsixteen according to the Records. At Kusaka they fought their first\r\nbattle against the army of Prince Nagasune and were repulsed, Prince\r\nItsuse being wounded by an arrow which struck his elbow. It was\r\ntherefore decided to change the direction of advance, so that instead\r\nof moving eastward in the face of the sun, a procedure unpleasing to\r\nthe goddess of that orb, they should move westward with the sun\r\nbehind them. This involved re-embarking and sailing southward round\r\nthe Kii promontory so as to land on its eastern coast, but the\r\ndangerous operation of putting an army on board ship in the presence\r\nof a victorious enemy was successfully achieved by the aid of\r\nskilfully used shields.\r\n\r\nOn the voyage round Kii, where stormy seas are frequent, the fleet\r\nencountered a heavy gale and the boats containing two of the princes\r\nwere lost.* Prince Itsuse had already died of his wound, so of the\r\nfour brothers there now remained only the youngest, Prince Iware. It\r\nis recorded that, at the age of fifteen, he had been made heir to the\r\nthrone, the principle of primogeniture not being then recognized, and\r\nthus the deaths of his brothers did not affect that question. Landing\r\nultimately at Kumano on the southeast of Kii, the expeditionary force\r\nwas stricken by a pestilence, the prince himself not escaping. But at\r\nthe behest of the Sun goddess, the Kami of thunder caused a sword of\r\nspecial virtue to come miraculously into the possession of an\r\ninhabitant of Kii, who carried it to the prince, and at once the\r\nsickness was stayed. When, however, the army attempted to advance\r\ninto the interior, no roads were found and precipitous mountains\r\nbarred the progress. In this dilemma the Sun goddess sent down the\r\nthree-legged crow of the Sun** to act as guide.\r\n\r\n*In the Chronicles the two princes are represented as having\r\ndeliberately entered the stormy sea, angered that such hardships\r\nshould overtake the descendants of the ocean Kami.\r\n\r\n**The Yang-wu, or Sun-crow (Japanese Yata-garasu), is a creature of\r\npurely Chinese myth. It is supposed to be red in colour, to have\r\nthree legs, and to inhabit the sun.\r\n\r\nThus indiscriminately are the miraculous and the commonplace\r\nintermixed. Following this bird, the invading force pushed on into\r\nYamato, receiving the allegiance of a body of men who fished with\r\ncormorants in the Yoshino River and who doubtless supplied the army\r\nwith food, and the allegiance of fabulous beings with tails, who came\r\nout of wells or through cliffs. It is related that the invaders\r\nforced the elder of two brothers into a gyn which he had prepared for\r\ntheir destruction; and that on ascending a hill to reconnoitre,\r\nPrince Iware observed an army of women and a force of eighty\r\n\"earth-hiders (Tsuchi-gumo) with tails,\" by which latter epithet is\r\nto be understood bandits or raiders who inhabited caves.\r\n\r\nHow it fared with the amazons the annals do not say, but the eighty\r\nbandits were invited to a banquet and slaughtered in their cups.\r\nStill the expeditionary force encountered great opposition, the roads\r\nand passes being occupied by numerous hostile bands. An appeal was\r\naccordingly made for divine assistance by organizing a public\r\nfestival of worship, the vessels employed--eighty platters and as\r\nmany jars--being made by the hands of the prince himself with clay\r\nobtained from Mount Kagu in Yamato.* Several minor arrangements\r\nfollowed, and finally swords were crossed with the army of Nagasune,\r\nwho had inflicted a defeat on the invaders on the occasion of their\r\nfirst landing at Kusaka, when Prince Itsuse received a mortal wound.\r\nA fierce battle ensued. Prince Iware burned to avenge his brother's\r\ndeath, but repeated attacks upon Nagasune's troops proved abortive\r\nuntil suddenly a golden-plumaged kite perched on the end of Prince\r\nIware's bow, and its effulgence dazzled the enemy so that they could\r\nnot fight stoutly.**\r\n\r\n*The Chronicles state that the prince made ame on the platters. Ame\r\nis confectioned from malted millet and is virtually the same as the\r\nmalt extract of the Occident.\r\n\r\n**This tradition of the golden kite is cherished in Japan. The \"Order\r\nof the Golden Kite\" is the most coveted military distinction.\r\n\r\nFrom this incident the place where the battle occurred was called\r\nTabi-no-mura, a name now corrupted into Tomi-no-mura. It does not\r\nappear, however, that anything like a decisive victory was gained by\r\nthe aid of this miraculous intervention. Nagasune sought a conference\r\nwith Prince Iware, and declared that the ruler of Yamato, whom he\r\nserved, was a Kami who had formerly descended from heaven. He offered\r\nin proof of this statement an arrow and a quiver belonging to the\r\nKami. But Prince Iware demonstrated their correspondence with those\r\nhe himself carried. Nagasune, however, declining to abstain from\r\nresistance, was put to death by the Kami he served, who then made act\r\nof submission to Prince Iware.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this last incident lies in the indication it seems to\r\nafford that a race identical with the invaders had already settled in\r\nYamato. Prince Iware now caused a palace to be built on the plain of\r\nKashiwa-bara (called Kashihara by some historians), to the southwest\r\nof Mount Unebi, and in it assumed the imperial dignity, on the first\r\nday of the first month of the year 660 B.C. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto say that this date must be received with all reserve, and that the\r\nepithet \"palace\" is not to be interpreted in the European sense of\r\nthe term. The Chronicles, which alone attempt to fix the early dates\r\nwith accuracy, indicate 667 B.C. as the year of the expedition's\r\ndeparture from Kyushu, and assign to Prince Iware an age of\r\nforty-five at the time. He was therefore fifty-two when crowned at\r\nKashiwa-bara, and as the same authority makes him live to an age of\r\n127, it might be supposed that much would be told of the last\r\nseventy-five years of his life.\r\n\r\nBut whereas many pages are devoted to the story of his adventures\r\nbefore ascending the throne, a few paragraphs suffice for all that is\r\nsubsequently related of him. While residing in Kyushu he married and\r\nhad two sons, the elder of whom, Tagishi-mimi, accompanied him on his\r\neastward expedition. In Yamato he married again and had three sons,\r\nthe youngest of whom succeeded to the throne. The bestowing of titles\r\nand rewards naturally occupied much attention, and to religious\r\nobservances scarcely less importance seems to have been attached. All\r\nreferences to these latter show that the offices of priest and king\r\nwere united in the sovereign of these days. Thus it was by the\r\nEmperor that formulae of incantation to dissipate evil influences\r\nwere dictated; that sacrifices were performed to the heavenly Kami so\r\nas to develop filial piety; and that shrines were consecrated for\r\nworshiping the Imperial ancestors. Jimmu was buried in a tumulus\r\n(misasagi) on the northeast of Mount Unebi. The site is officially\r\nrecognized to this day, and on the 3rd of April every year it is\r\nvisited by an Imperial envoy, who offers products of mountain, river,\r\nand sea.\r\n\r\nTRACES OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nWhat traces of Chinese or foreign influence are to be found in the\r\nlegends and myths set down above? It is tolerably certain that\r\ncommunication existed between China and Japan from a date shortly\r\nprior to the Christian era, and we naturally expect to find that\r\nsince China was at that time the author of Asiatic civilization, she\r\ncontributed materially to the intellectual development of her island\r\nneighbour. Examining the cosmogonies of the two countries, we find at\r\nthe outset a striking difference. The Chinese did not conceive any\r\ncreator, ineffable, formless, living in space; whereas the Japanese\r\nimagined a great central Kami and two producing powers, invisible and\r\nworking by occult processes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a marked similarity of thought. For, as\r\non the death of Panku, the giant toiler of Chinese myth on whom\r\ndevolved the task of chiselling out the universe, his left eye was\r\ntransmitted into the orb of day and his right into the moon, so when\r\nthe Japanese Kami returned from his visit to the underworld, the sun\r\nemerged from the washing of his left eye and the moon from the\r\nwashing of his right. Japanese writers have sought to differentiate\r\nthe two myths by pointing out that the sun is masculine in China and\r\nfeminine in Japan, but such an objection is inadequate to impair the\r\nclose resemblance.\r\n\r\nIn truth \"creation from fragments of a fabulous anthropomorphic being\r\nis common to Chaldeans, Iroquois, Egyptians, Greeks, Tinnehs,\r\nMangaians, and Aryan Indians,\" and from that fact a connexion between\r\nancient Japan and West Asia might be deduced by reference to the\r\nbeings formed out of the parts: of the fire Kami's body when Izanagi\r\nput him to the sword. On the other hand, the tale of which the birth\r\nof the sun and the moon forms a part, namely, the visit of Izanagi to\r\nhades in search of Izanami, is an obvious reproduction of the\r\nBabylonian myth of Ishtar's journey to the underworld in search of\r\nDu'uzu, which formed the basis of the Grecian legend of Orpheus and\r\nEurydice. Moreover, Izanami's objection to return, on the ground of\r\nhaving already eaten of the food of the underworld, is a feature of\r\nmany ancient myths, among which may be mentioned the Indian story of\r\nNachiketas, where the name Yama, the Indian god of the lower world,\r\nbears an obvious resemblance to the Japanese yomi (hades), as does,\r\nindeed, the whole Indian myth of Yami and Yama to that of Izanagi and\r\nIzanami.\r\n\r\nIs it not also more than a mere coincidence that as all the Semitic\r\ntribes worshipped the goddess Isis, so--the Japanese worshipped, for\r\nsupreme being, the goddess of the Sun? Thus, here again there would\r\nseem to have been some path of communication other than that via\r\nChina between Japan and the west of Asia. Further, the \"river of\r\nheaven\"--the Milky Way--which so often figures in Japanese mythology,\r\nis prominent in Chinese also, and is there associated with the\r\nSpinning Damsel, just as in the Japanese legend it serves the Kami\r\nfor council-place after the injury done by Susanoo's violence to the\r\nSun goddess and her spinning maidens. It has been remarked\r\n[Chamberlain] that the chop-stick which Susanoo found floating down\r\na river in Izumo, and the sake (rice-wine) which he caused to be made\r\nfor the purpose of intoxicating the eight-headed serpent, are\r\nobviously products of Chinese civilization, but as for the rescue of\r\nthe maiden from the serpent, it is a plain replica of the legend of\r\nPerseus and Andromeda, which, if it came through China, left no mark\r\nin transit.\r\n\r\nLess palpable, but still sufficiently striking, is the resemblance\r\nbetween the story of Atalanta's golden apples and the casting down of\r\nIzanagi's head-dress and comb as grapes and bamboo sprouts to arrest\r\nthe pursuit of the \"hag of hades.\" But indeed this throwing of his\r\ncomb behind him by Izanagi and its conversion into a thicket are\r\ncommon incidents of ancient folk-lore, while in the context of this\r\nKami's ablutions on his return from hades, it may be noted that Ovid\r\nmakes Juno undergo lustration after a visit to the lower regions and\r\nthat Dante is washed in Lethe when he passes out of purgatory. Nor is\r\nthere any great stretch of imagination needed to detect a likeness\r\nbetween the feathered messenger sent from the Ark and the three\r\nenvoys--the last a bird--despatched from the \"plain of high heaven\"\r\nto report upon the condition of disturbed Japan. This comparison is\r\npartially vitiated, however, by the fact that there is no tradition\r\nof a deluge in Japanese annals, though such phenomena are like ly to\r\noccur occasionally in all lands and to produce a great impression on\r\nthe national imagination. \"Moreover, what is specially known to us as\r\nthe deluge has been claimed as an ancient Altaic myth. Yet here we\r\nhave the oldest of the undoubtedly Altaic nations without any legend\r\nof the kind.\" [Chamberlain.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, further, from the account of the Great-Name Possessor's\r\nvisit to the underworld, that one Japanese conception of hades\r\ncorresponded exactly with that of the Chinese, namely, a place where\r\npeople live and act just as they do on earth. But the religion out of\r\nwhich this belief grew in China had its origin at a date long\r\nsubsequent to the supposed age of the Gods in Japan. The peaches with\r\nwhich Izanagi pelted and drove back the thunder Kami sent by Izanami\r\nto pursue him on his return from the underworld were evidently\r\nsuggested by the fabulous female, Si Wang-mu, of Chinese legend, who\r\npossessed a peach tree, the fruit of which conferred immortality and\r\nrepelled the demons of disease. So, too, the tale of the palace of\r\nthe ocean Kami at the bottom of the sea, with its castle gate and\r\ncassia tree overhanging a well which serves as a mirror, forms a page\r\nof Chinese legendary lore, and, in a slightly altered form, is found\r\nin many ancient annals.\r\n\r\nThe sea monster mentioned in this myth is written with a Chinese\r\nideograph signifying \"crocodile,\" but since the Japanese cannot have\r\nhad any knowledge of crocodiles, and since the monster is usually\r\nrepresented pictorially as a dragon, there can be little doubt that\r\nwe are here confronted by the Dragon King of Chinese and Korean\r\nfolk-lore which had its palace in the depths of the ocean. In fact,\r\nthe Japanese, in all ages, have spoken of this legendary edifice as\r\nRyu no jo (the Dragon's castle).\r\n\r\nThe eminent sinologue, Aston, has shrewdly pointed out that the term\r\nwani (crocodile) may be a corruption of the Korean word, wang-in\r\n(king), which the Japanese pronounced \"wani.\" As for the \"curved\r\njewels,\" which appear on so many occasions, the mineral jade, or\r\njadelike stone, of which many of them were made, has never been met\r\nwith in Japan and must therefore have come from the continent of\r\nAsia. The reed boat in which the leech, first offspring of Izanagi\r\nand Izanami, was sent adrift, \"recalls the Accadian legend of Sargon\r\nand his ark of rushes, the biblical story of Moses as an infant and\r\nmany more,\" though it has no known counterpart in Chinese mythology.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that in spite of the honour paid to the stars in the\r\nChinese cosmogony, the only star specially alluded to in Japanese\r\nmyth is Kagase, who is represented as the last of the rebellious Kami\r\non the occasion of the subjugation of Izumo by order of the Sun\r\ngoddess and the Great-Producing Kami. So far as the Records and the\r\nChronicles are concerned, \"the only stars mentioned are Venus, the\r\nPleiades, and the Weaver,\" the last being connected with a Chinese\r\nlegend, as shown above.\r\n\r\nTwo other points remain to be noticed. One is that divination by\r\ncracks in a deer's roasted shoulder blade, a process referred to more\r\nthan once in the Records and the Chronicles, was a practice of the\r\nChinese, who seem to have borrowed it from the Mongolians; the other,\r\nthat the sounding arrow (nari-kabura) was an invention of the Huns,\r\nand came to Japan through China. It had holes in the head, and the\r\nair passing through these produced a humming sound. As for the\r\nChronicles, they are permeated by Chinese influence throughout. The\r\nadoption of the Chinese sexagenary cycle is not unnatural, but again\r\nand again speeches made by Chinese sovereigns and sages are put into\r\nthe mouths of Japanese monarchs as original utterances, so that\r\nwithout the Records for purposes of reference and comparison, even\r\nthe small measure of solid ground that can be constructed would be\r\ncut from under the student's feet.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: BUNDAI SUZURI BAKO (A WRITING SET)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: 'NO' MASKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRATIONALIZATION\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nTHE southwestern extremity of the main island of Japan is embraced by\r\ntwo large islands, Kyushu and Shikoku, the former lying on the west\r\nof the latter and being, in effect, the southern link of the island\r\nchain which constitutes the empire of Japan. Sweeping northward from\r\nFormosa and the Philippines is a strong current known as the\r\nKuro-shio (Black Tide), a name derived from the deep indigo colour of\r\nthe water. This tide, on reaching the vicinity of Kyushu, is\r\ndeflected to the east, and passing along the southern coast of Kyushu\r\nand the Kii promontory, takes its way into the Pacific. Evidently\r\nboats carried on the bosom of the Kuro-shio would be likely to make\r\nthe shore of Japan at one of three points, namely, the south, or\r\nsoutheast, of Kyushu, the south of Shikoku or the Kii promontory.\r\n\r\nNow, according to the Records, the first place \"begotten\" by Izanagi\r\nand Izanami was an island called Awa, supposed to be in the vicinity\r\nof Awaji. The latter is a long, narrow island stretching from the\r\nnortheast of Shikoku towards the shore of the main island--which it\r\napproaches very closely at the Strait of Yura--and forming what may\r\nbe called a gate, closing the eastern entrance to the Inland Sea.\r\nAfter the island of Awa, the producing couple gave birth to Awaji and\r\nsubsequently to Shikoku, which is described as an island having four\r\nfaces, namely, the provinces of Awa, Iyo, Tosa, and Sanuki.\r\n\r\nRejecting the obviously allegorical phantasy of \"procreation,\" we may\r\nreasonably suppose ourselves to be here in the presence of an\r\nemigration from the South Seas or from southern China, which debarks\r\non the coast of Awaji and thence crosses to Shikoku. Thereafter, the\r\nimmigrants touch at a triplet of small islands, described as \"in the\r\noffing,\" and thence cross to Kyushu, known at the time as Tsukushi.\r\nThis large island is described in the Records as having, like\r\nShikoku, one body and four faces, and part of it was inhabited by\r\nKumaso, of whom much is heard in Japanese history. From Kyushu the\r\ninvaders pass to the islands of Iki and Tsushima, which lie between\r\nKyushu and Korea, and thereafter they sail northward along the coast\r\nof the main island of Japan until they reach the island of Sado.\r\n\r\nAll this--and the order of advance follows exactly the procreation\r\nsequence given in the Records--lends itself easily to the supposition\r\nof a party of immigrants coming originally from the south, voyaging\r\nin a tentative manner round the country described by them, and\r\nestablishing themselves primarily on its outlying islands.\r\n\r\nThe next step, according to the Records, was to Yamato. About this\r\nname, Yamato, there has been some dispute. Alike in ancient and in\r\nmodern times the term has been applied, on the one hand, to the whole\r\nof the main island, and, on the other, to the single province of\r\nYamato. The best authorities, however, interpret it in the latter\r\nsense for the purposes of the Izanagi-and-Izanami legend, and that\r\ninterpretation is plainly consistent with the probabilities, for the\r\nimmigrants would naturally have proceeded from Awaji to the Kii\r\npromontory, where the province of Yamato lies. Thereafter--on their\r\n\"return,\" say the Records, and the expression is apposite--they\r\nexplored several small islands not identifiable by their names but\r\nsaid to have been in Kibi, which was the term then applied to the\r\nprovinces of Bingo, Bitchu, and Bizen, lying along the south coast of\r\nthe Inland Sea and thus facing the sun, so that the descriptive\r\nepithet \"sun-direction\" applied to the region was manifestly\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the whole narrative concerts well with the idea of a band\r\nof emigrants carried on the breast of the \"Black Tide,\" who first\r\nmake the circuit of the outlying fringe of islands, then enter the\r\nmainland at Yamato, and finally sail down the Inland Sea, using the\r\nsmall islands off its northern shore as points d'appui for\r\nexpeditions inland.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE OPINION\r\n\r\nJapanese euhemerists, several of whom, in former times as well as in\r\nthe present, have devoted much learned research to the elucidation of\r\ntheir country's mythology, insist that tradition never intended to\r\nmake such a demand upon human credulity as to ask it to believe in\r\nthe begetting of islands by normal process of procreation. They\r\nmaintain that such descriptions must be read as allegories. It then\r\nbecomes easy to interpret the doings of Izanagi and Izanami as simple\r\nacts of warlike aggression, and to suppose that they each commanded\r\nforces which were to have co-operated, but which, by failing at the\r\noutset to synchronize their movements, were temporarily unsuccessful.\r\nIt will seem, as we follow the course of later history, that the\r\nleading of armies by females was common enough to be called a feature\r\nof early Japan, and thus the role assigned to Izanami need not cause\r\nany astonishment. At their first miscarriage the two Kami, by better\r\norganization, overran the island of Awaji and then pushed on to\r\nShikoku, which they brought completely under their sway.\r\n\r\nBut what meaning is to be assigned to the \"plain of high heaven\"\r\n(Takama-ga-hara)? Where was the place thus designated? By a majority\r\nof Japanese interpreters Takama-ga-hara is identified as the region\r\nof Taka-ichi in Yamato province. The word did not refer to anything\r\nsupernatural but was used simply in an honorific sense. In later ages\r\nCourt officials were called \"lords of the moon\" (gekhei) or\r\n\"cloud-guests\" (unkaku), while officials not permitted to attend the\r\nCourt were known as \"groundlings\" (jige); the residence of the\r\nEmperor was designated \"purple-clouds hall\" (shishin-deri); to go\r\nfrom the Imperial capital to any other part of the country was to\r\n\"descend,\" the converse proceeding being called to \"ascend,\" and the\r\npalace received the names of \"blue sky\" and \"above the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day in Yamato province there is a hill called Takama-yama and a\r\nplain named Takama-no. The Records say that when the Sun goddess\r\nretired to a rock cave, a multitude of Kami met at Taka-ichi to\r\nconcert measures for enticing her out, and this Taka-ichi is\r\nconsidered to be undoubtedly the place of the same name in Yamato.\r\nBut some learned men hold that Takama-ga-hara was in a foreign\r\ncountry, and that the men who emigrated thence to Japan belonged to a\r\nrace very superior to that then inhabiting the islands. When,\r\nhowever, the leader of the invaders had established his Court in\r\nYamato the designation Takama-ga-hara came to be applied to the\r\nlatter place.\r\n\r\nWhichever theory be correct--and the latter certainly commends itself\r\nas the more probable--it will be observed that both agree in\r\nassigning to Takama-ga-hara a terrestrial location; both agree in\r\nassigning the sense of \"unsettled and turbulent\" to the \"floating,\r\ndrifting\" condition predicated of the country when the Kami first\r\ninterested themselves in it, and both agree in interpreting as an\r\ninsignium of military authority the \"jewelled spear\" given to Izanagi\r\nand Izanami--an interpretation borne out by the fact that, in\r\nsubsequent eras of Japanese history, it was customary for a ruler\r\nto delegate authority in this manner. Applying the same process\r\nof reasoning to the socalled \"birth\" of Kami, that process\r\nresolves itself very simply into the creation of chieftains and\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\nRATIONALIZATION OF THE LEGEND OF THE VISIT TO HADES\r\n\r\nIt would seem that from Yamato the invaders prosecuted their campaign\r\ninto the interior, reaching Izumo on the west coast. The Records\r\nsay that after Izanami's death in giving birth to the Kami of fire,\r\nshe was buried at Mount Kagu on the confines of Izumo and Hoki.\r\nNow the land of Yomi generally interpreted \"underworld\"--which\r\nIzanagi visited in search of Izanami, was really identical with\r\nYomi-shima, located between the provinces of Hoki and Izumo, and\r\nNe-no-Kuni*--commonly taken to mean the \"netherland\"--subsequently\r\nthe place of Susanoo's banishment, was in fact a designation of\r\nIzumo, or had the more extensive application of the modern Sanin-do\r\nand Sanyo-do (districts in the shadow of the hill and districts on\r\nthe sunny side of the hill), that is to say, the western provinces\r\nand the south coast of the Inland Sea.\r\n\r\n*In the language of ancient Japan ne meant \"mountain,\" and Ne-no-Kuni\r\nsignified simply \"Land of Mountains.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the allegory of the visit to hades would seem to signify,\r\ntherefore, was that Izanami was defeated in a struggle with the local\r\nchieftains of Izumo or with a rebellious faction in that province;\r\nwas compelled to make act of submission before Izanagi arrived to\r\nassist her--allegorically speaking she had eaten of the food of\r\nhades--and therefore the conference between her and Izanagi proved\r\nabortive. The hag who pursued Izanagi on his retreat from Yomi\r\nrepresents a band of amazons--a common feature in old Japan--and his\r\nassailant, the Kami of thunder, was a rebel leader.\r\n\r\nAs for the idea of blocking the \"even pass of hades\" with rocks, it\r\nappears to mean nothing more than that a military force was posted at\r\nHirasaka--now called Ifuyo-saka in Izumo--to hold the defile against\r\nthe insurgent troops under Izanami, who finally took the field\r\nagainst Izanagi. It may be inferred that the struggle ended\r\nindecisively, although Izanagi killed the chieftain who had\r\ninstigated the rebellion (the so-called \"Kami of fire\"), and that\r\nIzanami remained in Izumo, becoming ruler of that province, while\r\nIzanagi withdrew to the eastern part of Tsukushi (Kyushu), where he\r\nperformed the ceremony of grand lustration.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF SUSANOO\r\n\r\nThe story of Susanoo lends itself with equal facility to\r\nrationalization. His desire to go to his \"mother's land\" instead of\r\nobeying his father and ruling the \"sea-plain\" (unabara)--an\r\nappellation believed by some learned commentators to apply to\r\nKorea--may easily be interpreted to mean that he threw in his lot\r\nwith the rebellious chiefs in Izumo. Leading a force into Yamato, he\r\nlaid waste the land so that the \"green mountains were changed into\r\nwithered mountains,\" and the commotion throughout the country was\r\nlike the noise of \"flies swarming in the fifth month.\" Finally he was\r\ndriven out of Yamato, and retiring to Izumo, found that the local\r\nprefect was unable to resist the raids of a tribe from the\r\nnorth under the command of a chief whose name--Yachimata no\r\nOrochi--signified \"eight-headed serpent.\"\r\n\r\nThis tribe had invaded the province and taken possession of the hills\r\nand valleys in the upper reaches of the river Hi, whence tradition\r\ncame to speak of the tribe as a monster spreading over hills and\r\ndales and having pine forests growing on its back. The tribute of\r\nfemales, demanded yearly by the tribe, indicates an exaction not\r\nuncommon in those days, and the sword said to have been found by\r\nSusanoo in the serpent's tail was the weapon worn by the last and the\r\nstoutest of Orochi's followers.\r\n\r\nThere is another theory equally accordant with the annals and in some\r\nrespects more satisfying. It is that Susanoo and his son, Iso-takeru,\r\nwhen they were expelled from Yamato, dwelt in the land of\r\nShiragi--the eastern of the three kingdoms into which Korea was\r\nformerly divided--and that they subsequently built boats and rowed\r\nover to Izumo. This is distinctly stated in one version of the\r\nChronicles, and another variant says that when Iso-takeru descended\r\nfrom Takama-ga-hara, he carried with him the seeds of trees in great\r\nquantities but did not plant them in \"the land of Han\" (Korea).\r\nFurther, it is elsewhere stated that the sword found by Susanoo in\r\nthe serpent's tail was called by him Orochi no Kara-suki (Orochi's\r\nKorean blade), an allusion which goes to strengthen the reading of\r\nthe legend.\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OF NINIGI\r\n\r\nOmitting other comparatively trivial legends connected with the age\r\nof Susanoo and his descendants, we come to what may be called the\r\nsecond great event in the early annals of Japan, namely, the descent\r\nof Ninigi on the southern coast of Tsukushi (Kyushu). The Records and\r\nthe Chronicles explicitly state that this expedition was planned in\r\nthe court at Takama-ga-hara (the \"plain of high heaven\"), and that,\r\nafter sending forces to subdue the disturbed country and to obtain\r\nthe submission of its ruler, the grandson (Ninigi) of the Sun goddess\r\nwas commissioned to take possession of the land. It is also clearly\r\nshown that Izumo was the centre of disturbance and that virtually all\r\nthe preliminary fighting took place there. Yet when Ninigi descends\r\nfrom Takama-ga-hara--a descent which is described in one account as\r\nhaving taken place in a closed boat, and in another, as having been\r\neffected by means of the coverlet of a couch--he is said to have\r\nlanded, not in Izumo or in Yamato, but at a place in the far south,\r\nwhere he makes no recorded attempt to fulfil the purpose of his\r\nmission, nor does that purpose receive any practical recognition\r\nuntil the time of his grandson Iware. The latter pushes northward,\r\nencountering the greatest resistance in the very province (Yamato)\r\nwhere his grandfather's expedition was planned and where the Imperial\r\nCourt was held.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that these conditions cannot be reconciled except on one\r\nof two suppositions: either that the Takama-ga-hara of this section\r\nof the annals was in a foreign country, or that the descent of Ninigi\r\nin the south of Japan was in the sequel of a complete defeat\r\ninvolving the Court's flight from Yamato as well as from Izumo.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the theory of a foreign country. Was it Korea\r\nor was it China? In favour of Korea there are only two arguments, one\r\nvague and the other improbable. The former is that one of Ninigi's\r\nalleged reasons for choosing Tsukushi as a landing-place was that it\r\nfaced Korea. The latter, that Tsukushi was selected because it\r\noffered a convenient base for defending Japan against Korea. It will\r\nbe observed that the two hypotheses are mutually conflicting, and\r\nthat neither accounts for debarkation at a part of Tsukushi\r\nconspicuously remote from Korea. It is not wholly impossible,\r\nhowever, that Ninigi came from China, and that the Court which is\r\nsaid to have commissioned him was a Chinese Court.\r\n\r\nIn the history of China a belief is recorded that the Japanese\r\nsovereigns are descended from a Chinese prince, Tai Peh, whose father\r\nwished to disinherit him in favour of a younger son. Tai Peh fled to\r\nWu in the present Chekiang, and thence passed to Japan about 800 B.C.\r\nAnother record alleges that the first sovereign of Japan was a son of\r\nShao-kang of the Hsia dynasty (about 850 B.C.), who tattooed his body\r\nand cut off his hair for purposes of disguise and lived on the bank\r\nof the Yangtsze, occupying himself with fishing until at length he\r\nfled to Japan.\r\n\r\nThat Ninigi may have been identical with one of these persons is not\r\ninconceivable, but such a hypothesis refuses to be reconciled with\r\nthe story of the fighting in Izumo which preceded the descent to\r\nTsukushi. The much more credible supposition is that the Yamato\r\nCourt, confronted by a formidable rebellion having its centre in\r\nIzumo, retired to Tsukushi, and there, in the course of years,\r\nmustered all its followers for an expedition ultimately led by the\r\ngrandson of the fugitive monarch to restore the sway of his house.\r\nThis interpretation of the legend consists with the fact that when\r\nJimmu reached Yamato, the original identity of his own race with that\r\nof the then ruler of the province was proved by a comparison of\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF THE OCEAN KAMI\r\n\r\nWith regard to the legend of the ocean Kami, the rationalists\r\nconceive that the tribe inhabiting Tsukushi at the time of Ninigi's\r\narrival there had originally immigrated from the south and had\r\ngradually spread inland. Those inhabiting the littoral districts were\r\nultimately placed by Ninigi under the rule of Prince Hohodemi, and\r\nthose inhabiting the mountain regions under the sway of Prince\r\nHosuseri. The boats and hooks of the legend are symbolical of\r\nmilitary and naval power respectively. The brothers having quarrelled\r\nabout the limits of their jurisdictions, Hohodemi was worsted, and by\r\nthe advice of a local elder he went to Korea to seek assistance.\r\nThere he married the daughter of the Ocean King--so called because\r\nKorea lay beyond the sea from Japan--and, after some years'\r\nresidence, was given a force of war-vessels (described in the legend\r\nas \"crocodiles\") together with minute instructions (the tide-ebbing\r\nand the tide-flowing jewels) as to their skilful management. These\r\nships ultimately enabled him to gain a complete victory over his\r\nelder brother.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE JAPANESE BELIEVE\r\n\r\nThese rationalizing processes will commend themselves in different\r\ndegrees to different minds. One learned author has compared such\r\nanalyses to estimating the historical residuum of the Cinderella\r\nlegend by subtracting the pumpkin coach and the godmother. But we are\r\nconstrained to acknowledge some background of truth in the annals of\r\nold Japan, and anything that tends to disclose that background is\r\nwelcome. It has to be noted, however, that though many learned\r\nJapanese commentators have sought to rationalize the events described\r\nin the Records and the Chronicles, the great bulk of the nation\r\nbelieves in the literal accuracy of these works as profoundly as the\r\ngreat bulk of Anglo-Saxon people believes in the Bible, its\r\ncosmogony, and its miracles.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the Japanese creed, as based on their ancient annals, may\r\nbe briefly summarized. They hold that when the Sun goddess handed the\r\nthree sacred objects to Ninigi--generally called Tenson, or \"heavenly\r\ngrandchild\"--she ordained that the Imperial Throne should be coeval\r\nwith heaven and earth. They hold that the instructions given with\r\nregard to these sacred objects comprised the whole code of\r\nadministrative ethics. The mirror neither hides nor perverts; it\r\nreflects evil qualities as faithfully as good; it is the emblem of\r\nhonesty and purity. The jewel illustrates the graces of gentleness,\r\nsoftness, amiability, and obedience, and is therefore emblematic of\r\nbenevolence and virtue.* The sword indicates the virtues of strength,\r\nsharpness, and practical decision, and is thus associated with\r\nintelligence and knowledge. So long as all these qualities are\r\nexercised in the discharge of administrative functions, there can be\r\nno misrule.\r\n\r\n*It must be remembered that the jewel referred to was a piece of\r\ngreen or white jade.\r\n\r\nThey further hold that when the Sun goddess detailed five Kami to\r\nform the suite of Ninigi, these Kami were entrusted with the\r\nministerial duties originally discharged by them, and becoming the\r\nheads of five administrative departments, transmitted their offices\r\nto generation after generation of their descendants. Thus Koyane was\r\nthe ancestor of the Nakatomi family who discharged the priestly\r\nduties of worship at the Court and recited the Purification Rituals;\r\nFutodama became the ancestor of the Imibe (or Imbe), a hereditary\r\ncorporation whose members performed all offices connected with\r\nmourning and funerals; Usume became ancestress of the Sarume, whose\r\nduties were to perform dances in honour of the deities and to act as\r\nmediums of divine inspiration; Oshihi was the ancestor of the Otomo\r\nchief who led the Imperial troops, and Kume became the ancestor of\r\nthe Kumebe, a hereditary corporation of palace guards. Further, they\r\nhold that whereas Ninigi and his five adjunct Kami all traced their\r\nlineage to the two producing Kami of the primal trinity, the special\r\ntitle of sovereignty conferred originally on the Sun goddess was\r\ntransmitted by her to the Tenson (heavenly grandchild), Ninigi, the\r\ndistinction of ruler and ruled being thus clearly defined. Finally\r\nthey hold that Ninigi and these five adjunct Kami, though occupying\r\ndifferent places in the national polity, had a common ancestor whom\r\nthey jointly worshipped, thus forming an eternal union.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ANCIENT CIVIL AND MILITARY HEAD-GEAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE JAPANESE NATION: HISTORICAL EVIDENCES\r\n\r\nIN considering the question of the origin of the Japanese nation four\r\nguides are available; namely, written annals, archaeological relics,\r\nphysical features, and linguistic affinities.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN ANNALS\r\n\r\nThe annals, that is to say, the Records and the Chronicles, speak of\r\nsix peoples; namely, first, Izanagi and his fellow Kami, who, as\r\nshown above, may reasonably be identified with the original\r\nimmigrants represented in the story of the so-called \"birth\" of the\r\nislands; secondly, Jimmu and his followers, who re-conquered the\r\nislands; thirdly, the Yemishi, who are identical with the modern\r\nAinu; fourthly, the Kumaso; fifthly, the Sushen; and sixthly the\r\nTsuchi-gumo (earth-spiders). By naming these six separately it is not\r\nintended to imply that they are necessarily different races: that\r\nremains to be decided. It will be convenient to begin with the\r\nSushen.\r\n\r\nTHE SUSHEN\r\n\r\nThe Sushen were Tungusic ancestors of the Manchu. They are first\r\nmentioned in Japanese annals in A.D. 549, when a number of them\r\narrived by boat on the north of Sado Island and settled there, living\r\non fish caught during spring and summer and salted or dried for\r\nwinter use. The people of Sado regarded them as demons and carefully\r\navoided them, a reception which implies total absence of previous\r\nintercourse. Finally they withdrew, and nothing more is heard of\r\ntheir race for over a hundred years, when, in A.D. 658, Hirafu, omi\r\nof Abe and warden of Koshi (the northwestern provinces, Etchu,\r\nEchizen, and Echigo), went on an expedition against them.\r\n\r\nNothing is recorded as to the origin or incidents of this campaign.\r\nOne account says that Hirafu, on his return, presented two white\r\nbears to the Empress; that he fought with the Sushen and carried back\r\nforty-nine captives. It may be assumed, however, that the enterprise\r\nproved abortive, for, two years later (660), he was again sent\r\nagainst the Sushen with two hundred ships. En route for his\r\ndestination he took on board his own vessel some of the inhabitants\r\nof Yezo (Yemishi) to act as guides, and the flotilla arrived\r\npresently in the vicinity of a long river, unnamed in the annals but\r\nsupposed to have been the Ishikari, which debouches on the west coast\r\nof Yezo. There a body of over a thousand Yemishi in a camp facing the\r\nriver sent messengers to report that the Sushen fleet had arrived in\r\ngreat force and that they were in imminent danger. The Sushen had\r\nover twenty vessels and were lying in a concealed port whence Hirafu\r\nin vain sent messengers to summon them.\r\n\r\nWhat ensued in thus told in the Chronicles: \"Hirafu heaped up on the\r\nbeach coloured silk stuffs, weapons, iron, etc.,\" to excite the\r\ncupidity of the Sushen, who thereupon drew up their fleet in order,\r\napproached \"with equal oars, flying flags made of feathers tied to\r\npoles, and halted in a shallow place. Then from one of their ships\r\nthey sent forth two old men who went round the coloured silk stuffs\r\nand other articles which had been piled up, examined them closely,\r\nwhereafter they changed the single garments they had on, and each\r\ntaking up a piece of cloth went on board their ship and departed.\"\r\nMeanwhile the Japanese had not made any attempt to molest them.\r\nPresently the two old men returned, took off the exchanged garments\r\nand, laying them down together with the cloth they had taken away,\r\nre-embarked and departed.\r\n\r\nUp to this Hirafu seems to have aimed at commercial intercourse. But\r\nhis overtures having been rejected, he sent to summon the Sushen.\r\nThey refused to come, and their prayer for peace having been\r\nunsuccessful, they retired to \"their own palisades.\" There the\r\nJapanese attacked them, and the Sushen, seeing that defeat was\r\ninevitable, put to death their own wives and children. How they\r\nthemselves fared is not recorded, nor do the Chronicles indicate\r\nwhere \"their own palisades\" were situated, but in Japan it has always\r\nbeen believed that the desperate engagement was fought in the Amur\r\nRiver, and its issue may be inferred from the fact that although the\r\nJapanese lost one general officer, Hirafu was able on his return to\r\npresent to the Empress more than fifty \"barbarians,\" presumably\r\nSushen. Nevertheless, it is recorded that in the same year (A.D.\r\n660), forty-seven men of Sushen were entertained at Court, and the\r\ninference is either that these were among the above \"savages\"--in\r\nwhich case Japan's treatment of her captured foes in ancient times\r\nwould merit applause--or that the Sushen had previously established\r\nrelations with Japan, and that Hirafu's campaign was merely to repel\r\ntrespass.\r\n\r\nDuring the next sixteen years nothing more is heard of the Sushen,\r\nbut, in A.D. 676, seven of them arrived in the train of an envoy from\r\nSinra, the eastern of the three kingdoms into which Korea was then\r\ndivided. This incident evokes no remark whatever from the compilers\r\nof the Chronicles, and they treat with equal indifference the\r\nstatement that during the reign of the Empress Jito, in the year A.D.\r\n696, presents of coats and trousers made of brocade, together with\r\ndark-red and deep-purple coarse silks, oxen, and other things were\r\ngiven to two men of Sushen. Nothing in this brief record suggests\r\nthat any considerable intercourse existed in ancient times between\r\nthe Japanese and the Tungusic Manchu, or that the latter settled in\r\nJapan in any appreciable numbers.\r\n\r\nTHE YEMISHI\r\n\r\nThe Yemishi are identified with the modern Ainu. It appears that the\r\ncontinental immigrants into Japan applied to the semi-savage races\r\nencountered by them the epithet \"Yebisu\" or \"Yemishi,\" terms which\r\nmay have been interchangeable onomatopes for \"barbarian.\" The\r\nYemishi are a moribund race. Only a remnant, numbering a few\r\nthousands, survives, now in the northern island of Yezo. Nevertheless\r\nit has been proved by Chamberlain's investigations into the origin of\r\nplace-names, that in early times the Yemishi extended from the north\r\ndown the eastern section of Japan as far as the region where the\r\npresent capital (Tokyo) stands, and on the west to the province now\r\ncalled Echizen; and that, when the Nihongi was written, they still\r\noccupied a large part of the main island.\r\n\r\nWe find the first mention of them in a poem attributed to the Emperor\r\nJimmu. Conducting his campaign for the re-conquest of Japan, Jimmu,\r\nuncertain of the disposition of a band of inhabitants, ordered his\r\ngeneral, Michi, to construct a spacious hut (muro) and invite the\r\neighty doubtful characters to a banquet. An equal number of Jimmu's\r\nsoldiers acted as hosts, and, at a given signal, when the guests were\r\nall drunk, they were slaughtered. Jimmu composed a couplet expressing\r\nhis troops' delight at having disposed of a formidable foe so easily,\r\nand in this verselet he spoke of one Yemishi being reputed to be a\r\nmatch for a hundred men.\r\n\r\nWhether this couplet really belongs to its context, however, is\r\nquestionable; the eighty warriors killed in the muro may not have\r\nbeen Yemishi at all. But the verse does certainly tend to show that\r\nthe Yemishi had a high fighting reputation in ancient times, though\r\nit will presently be seen that such fame scarcely consists with the\r\nfacts revealed by history. It is true that when next we hear of the\r\nYemishi more than seven and a half centuries have passed, and during\r\nthat long interval they may have been engaged in a fierce struggle\r\nfor the right of existence. There is no evidence, however, that such\r\nwas the case.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it would seem that the Japanese invaders encountered\r\nno great resistance from the Yemishi in the south, and were for a\r\nlong time content to leave them unmolested in the northern and\r\neastern regions. In A.D. 95, however, Takenouchi-no-Sukune was\r\ncommissioned by the Emperor Keiko to explore those regions. He\r\ndevoted two years to the task, and, on his return in 97, he submitted\r\nto his sovereign this request: \"In the eastern wilds there is a\r\ncountry called Hi-taka-mi (Sun-height). The people of this country,\r\nboth men and women, tie up their hair in the form of a mallet and\r\ntattoo their bodies. They are of fierce temper and their general name\r\nis Yemishi. Moreover, the land is wide and fertile. We should attack\r\nit and take it.\" [Aston's translation.] It is observable that the\r\nprincipal motive of this advice is aggressive. The Yemishi had not\r\nmolested the Japanese or shown any turbulence. They ought to be\r\nattacked because their conquest would be profitable: that was\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nTakenouchi's counsels could not be immediately followed. Other\r\nbusiness of a cognate nature in the south occupied the Court's\r\nattention, and thirteen years elapsed before (A.D. 110) the\r\ncelebrated hero, Prince Yamato-dake, led an expedition against the\r\nYemishi of the east. In commanding him to undertake this task, the\r\nEmperor, according to the Chronicles, made a speech which, owing to\r\nits Chinese tone, has been called apocryphal, though some, at any\r\nrate, of the statements it embodies are attested by modern\r\nobservation of Ainu manners and customs. He spoke of the Yemishi as\r\nbeing the most powerful among the \"eastern savages;\" said that their\r\n\"men and women lived together promiscuously,\" that there was \"no\r\ndistinction of father and child;\" that in winter \"they dwelt in holes\r\nand in summer they lived in huts;\" that their clothing consisted of\r\nfurs and that they drank blood; that when they received a favour they\r\nforgot it, but if an injury was done them they never failed to avenge\r\nit, and that they kept arrows in their top-knots and carried swords\r\nwithin their clothing. How correct these attributes may have been at\r\nthe time they were uttered, there are no means of judging, but the\r\ncustoms of the modern Ainu go far to attest the accuracy of the\r\nEmperor Keiko's remarks about their ancestors.\r\n\r\nYamato-dake prefaced his campaign by worshipping at the shrine of\r\nIse, where he received the sword \"Herb-queller,\" which Susanoo had\r\ntaken from the last chieftain of the Izumo tribesmen. Thence he\r\nsailed along the coast to Suruga, where he landed, and was nearly\r\ndestroyed by the burning of a moor into which he had been persuaded\r\nto penetrate in search of game. Escaping with difficulty, and having\r\ntaken a terrible vengeance upon the \"brigands\" who had sought to\r\ncompass his destruction, he pushed on into Sagami, crossed the bay to\r\nKazusa and, sailing north, reached the southern shore of Shimosa,\r\nwhich was the frontier of the Yemishi. The vessels of the latter\r\nassembled with the intention of offering resistance, but at the\r\naspect of the Japanese fleet and the incomparably superior arms and\r\narrows of the men it carried, they submitted unconditionally and\r\nbecame personal attendants on Yamato-dake.\r\n\r\nThree things are noticeable in this narrative. The first is that the\r\n\"brigands of Suruga\" were not Yemishi; the second, that the Yemishi\r\noffered no resistance, and the third, that the Yemishi chiefs are\r\ncalled in the Chronicles \"Kami of the islands\" and \"Kami of the\r\ncountry\"--titles which indicate that they were held in some respect\r\nby the Japanese. It is not explicitly recorded that Yamato-dake had\r\nany further encounter with the Yemishi, but figurative references\r\nshow that he had much fighting. The Chronicles quote him as saying,\r\nafter his return to Kii from an extended march through the\r\nnortheastern provinces and after penetrating as far as Hi-taka-mi\r\n(modern Hitachi), the headquarters of the Yemishi, that the only\r\nYemishi who remained unsubmissive were those of Shinano and Koshi\r\n(Echigo, Etchu, and Echizen). But although Yamato-dake subsequently\r\nentered Shinano, where he suffered much from the arduous nature of\r\nthe ground, and though he sent a general to explore Koshi, he\r\nultimately retired to Owari, where he died from the effects of\r\nfatigue and exposure according to some authorities, of a wound from a\r\npoisoned arrow according to others. His last act was to present as\r\nslaves to the shrine of Ise the Yemishi who had originally\r\nsurrendered and who had subsequently attached themselves to his\r\nperson. They proved so noisy, however, that the priestess of the\r\nshrine sent them to the Yamato Court, which assigned for them a\r\nsettlement on Mount Mimoro. Here, too, their conduct was so turbulent\r\nthat they received orders to divide and take up their abode at any\r\nplace throughout the five provinces of Harima, Sanuki, Iyo, Aki, and\r\nAwa, where, in after ages, they constituted a hereditary corporation\r\nof Saeki (Saekibe).\r\n\r\nThese details deserve to be recorded, for their sequel shows\r\nhistorically that there is an Yemishi element in the Japanese race.\r\nThus, in later times we find the high rank of muraji borne by a\r\nmember of the Saekibe. Fifteen years (A.D. 125) after the death of\r\nYamato-dake, Prince Sajima was appointed governor-general of the\r\nfifteen provinces of Tosan-do (the Eastern Mountain circuit); that is\r\nto say, the provinces along the east coast. He died en route and his\r\nson, Prince Mimoro, succeeded to the office. During his tenure of\r\npower the Yemishi raised a disturbance, but no sooner was force\r\nemployed against them than they made obeisance and threw themselves\r\non the mercy of the Japanese, who pardoned all that submitted.\r\n\r\nThis orderly condition remained uninterrupted until A.D. 367, when\r\nthe Yemishi in Kazusa made one of the very few successful revolts on\r\nrecord. They killed Tamichi, a Japanese general sent against them,\r\nand they drove back his forces, who do not appear to have taken very\r\neffective measures of retaliation. In 482 we find the Yemishi\r\nrendering homage to the Emperor Kenso, a ceremony which was repeated\r\non the accession of the Emperor Kimmei (540).\r\n\r\nBut, though meek in the presence of peril, the Yemishi appear to have\r\nbeen of a brawling temperament. Thus, in 561, several thousands of\r\nthem showed hostility on the frontier, yet no sooner were their\r\nchiefs threatened with death than they submitted. At that time all\r\nthe provinces in the northeast and northwest--then included in Mutsu\r\nand Dewa--were in Yemishi possession. They rebelled again in 637, and\r\nat first gained a signal success, driving the Japanese general,\r\nKatana, into a fortress where he was deserted by his troops. His wife\r\nsaved the situation. She upbraided her husband as he was scaling the\r\npalisades to escape by night, fortified him with wine, girded his\r\nsword on herself, and caused her female attendants--of whom there\r\nwere \"several tens\"--to twang bowstrings. Katana, taking heart of\r\ngrace, advanced single handed; the Yemishi, thinking that his troops\r\nhad rallied, gave way, and the Japanese soldiers, returning to their\r\nduty, killed or captured all the insurgents.\r\n\r\nNo other instance of equally determined resistance is recorded on the\r\npart of the Yemishi. In 642, several thousands made submission in\r\nKoshi. Four years later (646), we find Yemishi doing homage to the\r\nEmperor Kotoku. Yet in 645 it was deemed necessary to establish a\r\nbarrier settlement against them in Echigo; and whereas, in 655, when\r\nthe Empress Saimei ascended the throne, her Court at Naniwa\r\nentertained ninety-nine of the northern Yemishi and forty-five of the\r\neastern, conferring cups of honour on fifteen, while at the same time\r\nanother numerous body came to render homage and offer gifts, barely\r\nthree years had elapsed when, in 655, a Japanese squadron of 180\r\nvessels, under the command of Hirafu, omi of Abe, was engaged\r\nattacking the Yemishi at Akita on the northwest coast of the main\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAll this shows plainly that many districts were still peopled by\r\nYemishi and that their docility varied in different localities. In\r\nthe Akita campaign the usual surrender was rehearsed. The Yemishi\r\ndeclared that their bows and arrows were for hunting, not for\r\nfighting, and the affair ended in a great feast given by Hirafu, the\r\nsequel being that two hundred Yemishi proceeded to Court, carrying\r\npresents, and were appointed to various offices in the localities\r\nrepresented, receiving also gifts of arms, armour, drums, and flags.*\r\n\r\n*It is related that these flags had tops shaped like cuttlefish.\r\n\r\nAn interesting episode is recorded of this visit. One of the Yemishi,\r\nhaving been appointed to a high post, was instructed to investigate\r\nthe Yemishi population and the captive population. Who were these\r\ncaptives? They seem to have been Sushen, for at the feast given by\r\nHirafu his Yemishi guests came accompanied by thirty-five captives,\r\nand it is incredible that Japanese prisoners would have been thus\r\nhumiliated in the sight of their armed countrymen. There will be\r\noccasion to recur to this point presently. Here we have to note that\r\nin spite of frequent contact, friendly or hostile, and in spite of so\r\nmany years of intercourse, the Yemishi seem to have been still\r\nregarded by the Japanese as objects of curiosity. For, in the year\r\n654, envoys from Yamato to the Tang Emperor of China took with them a\r\nYemishi man and woman to show to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese sovereign was much struck by the unwonted appearance of\r\nthese people. He asked several questions, which are recorded verbatim\r\nin the Chronicles; and the envoys informed him that there were three\r\ntribes of Yemishi; namely, the Tsugaru* Yemishi, who were the most\r\ndistant; next, the Ara Yemishi (rough or only partially subdued), and\r\nlastly, the Nigi Yemishi (quiet or docile); that they sustained life\r\nby eating, not cereals, but flesh, and that they dispensed with\r\nhouses, preferring to live under trees and in the recesses of\r\nmountains. The Chinese Emperor finally remarked, \"When we look at the\r\nunusual bodily appearance of these Yemishi, it is strange in the\r\nextreme.\"\r\n\r\n*The Story of Korea, by Longford.\r\n\r\nEvidently whatever the original provenance of the Yemishi, they had\r\nnever been among the numerous peoples who observed the custom of\r\npaying visits of ceremony to the Chinese capital. They were\r\napparently not included in the family of Far Eastern nations. From\r\nthe second half of the seventh century they are constantly found\r\ncarrying tribute to the Japanese Court and receiving presents or\r\nbeing entertained in return. But these evidences of docility and\r\nfriendship were not indicative of the universal mood. The Yemishi\r\nlocated in the northeastern section of the main island continued to\r\ngive trouble up to the beginning of the ninth century, and throughout\r\nthis region as well as along the west coast from the thirty-eighth\r\nparallel of latitude northward the Japanese were obliged to build six\r\ncastles and ten barrier posts between A.D. 647 and 800.\r\n\r\nThese facts, however, have no concern with the immediate purpose of\r\nthis historical reference further than to show that from the earliest\r\ntimes the Yamato immigrants found no opponents in the northern half\r\nof the island except the Yemishi and the Sushen. One more episode,\r\nhowever, is germane. In the time (682) of the Emperor Temmu, the\r\nYemishi of Koshi, who had by that time become quite docile, asked for\r\nand received seven thousand families of captives to found a district.\r\nA Japanese writing alleges that these captives were subjects of the\r\nCrown who had been seized and enslaved by the savages. But that is\r\ninconsistent with all probabilities. The Yamato might sentence these\r\npeople to serfdom among men of their own race, but they never would\r\nhave condemned Japanese to such a position among the Yemishi.\r\nEvidently these \"captives\" were prisoners taken by the Yamato from\r\nthe Koreans, the Sushen, or some other hostile nation.\r\n\r\nTHE KUMASO\r\n\r\nThere has been some dispute about the appellation \"Kumaso.\" One high\r\nauthority thinks that Kuma and So were the names of two tribes\r\ninhabiting the extreme south of Japan; that is to say, the provinces\r\nnow called Hyuga, Osumi, and Satsuma. Others regard the term as\r\ndenoting one tribe only. The question is not very material. Among all\r\nthe theories formed about the Kumaso, the most plausible is that they\r\nbelonged to the Sow race of Borneo and that they found their way to\r\nJapan on the breast of the \"Black Tide.\" Many similarities of custom\r\nhave been traced between the two peoples. Both resorted freely to\r\nornamental tattooing; both used shields decorated with hair; both\r\nwere skilled in making articles of bamboo, especially hats; both were\r\nfond of dancing with accompaniment of singing and hand-clapping; and\r\nboth dressed their hair alike. Japanese annals use the word \"Kumaso\"\r\nfor the first time in connexion with the annexation of Tsukushi\r\n(Kyushu) by the Izanagi expedition, when one of the four faces of the\r\nisland is called the \"land of Kumaso.\" Plainly if this nomenclature\r\nmay be taken as evidence, the Kumaso must have arrived in Japan at a\r\ndate prior to the advent of the immigrants represented by Izanagi and\r\nIzanami; and it would further follow that they did not penetrate far\r\ninto the interior, but remained in the vicinity of the place of\r\nlanding, which may be supposed to have been some point on the\r\nsouthern coast of Kyushu. Nor does there appear to have been any\r\ncollision between the two tides of immigrants, for the first\r\nappearance of the Kumaso in a truculent role was in A.D. 81 when they\r\nare said to have rebelled.\r\n\r\nThe incident, though remote from the capital, was sufficiently\r\nformidable to induce the Emperor Keiko to lead a force against them\r\nin person from Yamato. En route he had to deal with \"brigands\"\r\ninfesting Suwo and Buzen, provinces separated by the Inland Sea and\r\nsituated respectively on the south of the main island and the north\r\nof Kyushu. These provinces were ruled by chieftainesses, who declared\r\nthemselves loyal to the Imperial cause, and gave information about\r\nthe haunts and habits of the \"brigands,\" who in Suwo had no special\r\nappellation but in Buzen were known as Tsuchi-gumo, a name to be\r\nspoken of presently. They were disposed of partly by stratagem and\r\npartly by open warfare. But when the Yamato troops arrived in Hyuga\r\nwithin striking distance of the Kumaso, the Emperor hesitated. He\r\ndeemed it wise not to touch the spear-points of these puissant foes.\r\nUltimately he overcame them by enticing the two daughters of the\r\nprincipal leaders and making a show of affection for one of them. She\r\nconducted Japanese soldiers to her father's residence, and having\r\nplied him with strong drink, cut his bow-string while he slept so\r\nthat the soldiers could kill him with impunity. It is recorded that\r\nKeiko put the girl to death for her unfilial conduct, but the\r\nassassination of her father helped the Japanese materially in their\r\ncampaign against the Kumaso, whom they succeeded in subduing and in\r\nwhose land the Emperor remained six years.\r\n\r\nThe Kumaso were not quelled, however. Scarcely eight years had\r\nelapsed from the time of Keiko's return to Yamato when they rebelled\r\nagain, \"making ceaseless raids upon the frontier districts;\" and he\r\nsent against them his son, Yamato-dake; with a band of skilled\r\narchers. This youth, one of the most heroic figures in ancient\r\nJapanese history, was only sixteen. He disguised himself as a girl\r\nand thus gained access to a banquet given by the principal Kumaso\r\nleader to celebrate the opening of a new residence. Attracted by the\r\nbeauty of the supposed girl, the Kumaso chieftain placed her beside\r\nhim, and when he had drunk heavily, Yamato-dake stabbed him to the\r\nheart,* subsequently serving all his band in the same way. After\r\nthis, the Kumaso remained quiet for nearly a century, but in the year\r\n193,** during the reign of the Emperor Chuai, they once more\r\nrebelled, and the Emperor organized an expedition against them. He\r\nfailed in the struggle and was killed by the Kumaso's arrows.\r\nThenceforth history is silent about them.\r\n\r\n*The Chronicles relate that when the Kumaso was struck down he asked\r\nfor a moment's respite to learn the name of his slayer, whose prowess\r\nastounded him. On receiving an answer he sought the prince's\r\npermission to give him a title, and declared that instead of being\r\ncalled Yamato Oguna, the name hitherto borne by him, he should be\r\ntermed Yamato-dake (Champion of Japan) because he had conquered the\r\nhitherto unconquerable. The prince accepted the name, and then gave\r\nthe Kumaso his coup de grace.\r\n\r\n**It should be understood that these dates, being prehistoric, are\r\nnot wholly reliable.\r\n\r\nWho, then, were they? It is related in the Chronicles that, after\r\nbreaking the power of the Kumaso, the Emperor Keiko made a tour of\r\ninspection in Tsukushi (Kyushu), and arriving at the district of\r\nKuma, summoned two brothers, princes of Kuma, to pay homage. One\r\nobeyed, but the other refused, and soldiers were therefore sent to\r\nput him to death. Now Kuma was the name of the three kingdoms into\r\nwhich the Korean peninsula was divided in ancient times, and it has\r\nbeen suggested [Aston] that the land of Kuma in Korea was the parent\r\ncountry of Kuma in Japan, Kom in the Korean language having the same\r\nmeaning (bear) as Kuma in the Japanese. This, of course, involves the\r\nconclusion that the Kumaso were originally Korean emigrants; a theory\r\nsomewhat difficult to reconcile with their location in the extreme\r\nsouth of Kyushu.\r\n\r\nThe apparent silence of the annals about the subsequent career of the\r\ntribe is accounted for by supposing that the Kumaso were identical\r\nwith the Hayato (falcon men), who make their first appearance upon\r\nthe scene in prehistoric days as followers of Hosuseri in his contest\r\nwith his younger brother, Hohodemi, the hero of the legend about the\r\npalace of the sea god. Hohodemi according to the rationalized version\r\nof the legend having obtained assistance in the shape of ships and\r\nmariners from an oversea monarch (supposed to have reigned in Korea),\r\nreturned to Tsukushi to fight his brother, and being victorious,\r\nspared Hosuseri's life on condition that the descendants of the\r\nvanquished through eighty generations should serve the victor's\r\ndescendants as mimes.\r\n\r\n\"On that account,\" says the Chronicles, \"the various Hayato,\r\ndescended from Hosuseri to the present time, do not leave the\r\nvicinity of the Imperial palace enclosure and render service instead\r\nof watch-dogs.\" The first mention of the name Hayato after the\r\nprehistoric battle in Kyushu, occurs in the year 399, when Sashihire,\r\none of the tribe, was induced to assassinate his master, an Imperial\r\nprince. This incident goes to show that individual members of the\r\ntribe were then employed at Court; an inference confirmed fifty-one\r\nyears later, when, on the death of Emperor Yuryaku, \"the Hayato\r\nlamented night and day beside the misasagi (tomb) and refused the\r\nfood offered to them, until at the end of seven days they died.\"\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be doubted that we have here a reversion to the old\r\ncustom which compelled slaves to follow their lords to the grave. The\r\nHayato serving in the Court at that epoch held the status generally\r\nassigned in ancient days to vanquished people, the status of serfs or\r\nslaves. Six times during the next 214 years we find the Hayato\r\nrepairing to the Court to pay homage, in the performance of which\r\nfunction they are usually bracketted with the Yemishi. Once (682) a\r\nwrestling match took place in the Imperial presence between the\r\nHayato of Osumi and those of Satsuma, and once (694) the viceroy of\r\nTsukushi (Kyushu) presented 174 Hayato to the Court.\r\n\r\nTHE TSUCHI-GUMO\r\n\r\nIn ancient Japan there was a class of men to whom the epithet\r\n\"Tsuchi\" (earth-spiders) was applied. Their identity has been a\r\nsubject of much controversy. The first mention made of them in\r\nJapanese annals occurs in connexion with the slaughter of eighty\r\nbraves invited to a banquet by the Emperor Jimmu's general in a\r\npit-dwelling at Osaka.* The Records apply to these men the epithet\r\n\"Tsuchi-gumo,\" whereas the Chronicles represent the Emperor as\r\ncelebrating the incident in a couplet which speaks of them as\r\nYemishi. It will be seen presently that the apparent confusion of\r\nepithet probably conveys a truth.\r\n\r\n*This incident has been already referred to under the heading\r\n\"Yemishi.\" It is to be observed that the \"Osaka\" here mentioned is\r\nnot the modern city of Osaka.\r\n\r\nThe next allusion to Tsuchi-gumo occurs in the annals of the year\r\n(662 B.C.) following the above event, according to the chronology of\r\nthe Chronicles. The Emperor, having commanded his generals to\r\nexercise the troops, Tsuchi-gumo were found in three places, and as\r\nthey declined to submit, a detachment was sent against them.\r\nConcerning a fourth band of these defiant folk, the Chronicles say:\r\n\"They had short bodies and long legs and arms. They were of the same\r\nclass as the pigmies. The Imperial troops wove nets of dolichos,\r\nwhich they flung over them and then slew them.\"\r\n\r\nThere are four comments to be made on this. The first is that the\r\nscene of the fighting was in Yamato. The second, that the chiefs of\r\nthe Tsuchi-gumo had Japanese names--names identical, in two cases,\r\nwith those of a kind of Shinto priest (hafuri), and therefore most\r\nunlikely to have been borne by men not of Japanese origin. The third,\r\nthat the presence of Tsuchi-gumo in Yamato preceded the arrival of\r\nJimmu's expedition. And the fourth, that the Records are silent about\r\nthe whole episode. As for the things told in the Chronicles about\r\nshort bodies, long limbs, pigmies, and nets of dolichos, they may be\r\ndismissed as mere fancies suggested by the name Tsuchi-gumo, which\r\nwas commonly supposed to mean \"earth-spiders.\" If any inference may\r\nbe drawn from the Chronicles' story, it is that there were Japanese\r\nin Yamato before Jimmu's time, and that Tsuchi-gumo were simply bands\r\nof Japanese raiders.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: AINUS (INHABITANTS OF HOKKAIDO, THE NORTHERN ISLAND)\r\n\r\nThey are heard of next in the province of Bungo (on the northeast of\r\nKyushu) where (A.D. 82) the Emperor Keiko led an army to attack the\r\nKumaso. Two bands of Tsuchi-gumo are mentioned as living there, and\r\nthe Imperial forces had no little difficulty in subduing them. Their\r\nchiefs are described as \"mighty of frame and having numerous\r\nfollowers.\" In dealing with the first band, Keiko caused his bravest\r\nsoldiers to carry mallets made from camellia trees, though why such\r\nweapons should have been preferred to the trenchant swords used by\r\nthe Japanese there is nothing to show. (Another account says\r\n\"mallet-headed swords,\" which is much more credible). In dealing with\r\nthe second, he was driven back once by their rain of arrows, and when\r\nhe attacked from another quarter, the Tsuchi-gumo, their submission\r\nhaving been refused, flung themselves into a ravine and perished.\r\n\r\nHere again certain points have to be noticed: that there were\r\nTsuchi-gumo in Kyushu as well as in Yamato; that if one account\r\ndescribes them as pigmies, another depicts them as \"mighty of frame,\"\r\nand that in Kyushu, as in Yamato, the Tsuchi-gumo had Japanese names.\r\nOnly once again do the annals refer to Tsuchi-gumo. They relate\r\ncurtly that on his return from quelling the Kumaso the Emperor Keiko\r\nkilled a Tsuchi-gumo in the province of Hizen. The truth seems to be\r\nthat factitious import has been attached to the Tsuchi-gumo. Mainly\r\nbecause they were pit-dwellers, it was assumed for a tune that they\r\nrepresented a race which had immigrated to Japan at some date prior\r\nto the arrival of the Yemishi (modern Ainu). This theory was founded\r\non the supposed discovery of relics of pit-dwellers in the islands of\r\nYezo and Itorop, and their hasty identification as Kuro-pok-guru--the\r\nAinu term for underground dwellers--whose modern representatives are\r\nseen among the Kurilsky or their neighbours in Kamchatka and\r\nSaghalien. But closer examination of the Yezo and Itorop pits showed\r\nthat there was complete absence of any mark of antiquity--such as the\r\npresence of large trees or even deep-rooted brushwood;--that they\r\nwere arranged in regular order, suggesting a military encampment\r\nrather than the abode of savages; that they were of uniform size,\r\nwith few exceptions; that on excavation they yielded fragments of\r\nhard wood, unglazed pottery, and a Japanese dirk, and, finally, that\r\ntheir site corresponded with that of military encampments established\r\nin Yezo and the Kuriles by the Japanese Government in the early part\r\nof the nineteenth century as a defence against Russian aggression.\r\n\r\nEvidently the men who constructed and used these pit-dwellings were\r\nnot prehistoric savages but modern Japanese soldiers. Further very\r\nconclusive testimony has been collected by the Rev. John Batchelor,\r\nwho has devoted profound study to the Ainu. He found that the\r\ninhabitants of Shikotan, who had long been supposed to be a remnant\r\nof pre-Ainu immigrants, were brought thither from an island called\r\nShimushir in the Kurile group in 1885 by order of the Japanese\r\nGovernment; that they declared themselves to be descended from men of\r\nSaghalien; that they spoke nothing but the Ainu language, and that\r\nthey inhabited pits in winter, as do also the Ainu now living in\r\nSaghalien. If any further proof were needed, it might be drawn from\r\nthe fact that no excavation has brought to light any relics whatever\r\nof a race preceding and distinct from the Yemishi (Ainu), all the\r\npits and graves hitherto searched having yielded Yamato or Yemishi\r\nskulls. Neither has there been found any trace of pigmies.\r\n\r\nAn Ainu myth is responsible for the belief in the existence of such\r\nbeings: \"In very ancient times, a race of people who dwelt in pits\r\nlived among us. They were so very tiny that ten of them could easily\r\ntake shelter beneath one burdock leaf. When they went to catch\r\nherrings they used to make boats by sewing the leaves together, and\r\nalways fished with a hook. If a single herring was caught, it took\r\nall the strength of the men of five boats, or ten sometimes, to hold\r\nit and drag it ashore, while whole crowds were required to kill it\r\nwith their clubs and spears. Yet, strange to say, these divine little\r\nmen used even to kill great whales. Surely these pit-dwellers were\r\ngods.\"*\r\n\r\n*\"The Ainu and their Folk-lore,\" by Batchelor.\r\n\r\nEvidently if such legends are to be credited, the existence of\r\nfairies must no longer be denied in Europe. Side by side with the\r\ntotal absence of all tangible relics may be set the fact that,\r\nwhereas numerous place-names in the main island of Japan have been\r\nidentified as Ainu words, none has been traced to any alien tongue\r\nsuch as might be associated with earlier inhabitants. Thus, the\r\ntheory of a special race of immigrants anterior to the Yemishi has to\r\nbe abandoned so far as the evidence of pit-dwelling is concerned.\r\nThe fact is that the use of partially underground residences\r\ncannot be regarded as specially characteristic of any race or as\r\ndifferentiating one section of the people of Japan from another. To\r\nthis day the poorer classes in Korea depend for shelter upon pits\r\ncovered with thatch or strong oil-paper. They call these dwellings um\r\nor um-mak, a term corresponding to the Japanese muro. Pit-dwellers\r\nare mentioned in old Chinese literature, and the references to the\r\nmuro in the Records and Chronicles show that the muro of those days\r\nhad a character similar to that of the modern Korean um-mak [Aston].\r\nWe read of a muro being dug; of steps down to it; and we read of a\r\nmuro big enough to hold 160 persons at one time. The muro was not\r\nalways simply a hole roofed over: it sometimes contained a house\r\nhaving a wooden frame lashed together with vine-tendrils, the walls\r\nlined with sedges and reeds and plastered with a mixture of grass and\r\nclay. The roof was thatched with reeds; there was a door opening\r\ninwards, and a raised platform served for sleeping purposes. A\r\ndwelling closely resembling this description was actually unearthed\r\nnear Akita in O-U, in 1807. Muro were used in ancient times by the\r\nhighest as Well as the poorest classes. Susanoo is said by the Izumo\r\nFudoki to have made for himself a muro; Jimmu's sort is represented\r\nas sleeping in a great muro, and the Emperor Keiko, when (A.D.82)\r\nprosecuting his campaign in Kyushu, is said to have constructed a\r\nmuro for a temporary palace. \"In fact, pit-dwelling in northern\r\nclimates affords no indication of race.\"\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION FROM HISTORICAL EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nThus the conclusion suggested by historical evidence is that the\r\nJapanese nation is composed of four elements: the Yamato; the Yemishi\r\n(modern Ainu); the Kumaso (or Hayato), and the Sushen. As to the last\r\nof these, there is no conclusive indication that they ever immigrated\r\nin appreciable numbers. It does not follow, of course, that the\r\nhistorical evidence is exhaustive, especially Japanese historical\r\nevidence; for the annalists of Japan do not appear to have paid any\r\nspecial attention to racial questions.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ANCIENT HANGING BELLS\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FUTAMI-GA-URA (The Husband and Wife Rocks)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE NATION: GEOGRAPHICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RELICS\r\n\r\nJAPAN'S CONNEXION WITH THE ASIATIC CONTINENT\r\n\r\nTHE group of islands forming Japan may be said to have routes of\r\ncommunication with the continent of Asia at six places: two in the\r\nnorth; two in the southwest, and two in the south. The principal\r\nconnexion in the north is across the narrow strait of Soya from the\r\nnorthwest point of Yezo to Saghalien and thence to the Amur region of\r\nManchuria. The secondary connexion is from the north-east point of\r\nYezo via the long chain of the Kuriles to Kamchatka. The first of the\r\nsouthwestern routes is from the northwest of Kyushu via the islands\r\nof Iki and Tsushima to the southeast of Korea; and the second is from\r\nthe south of the Izumo promontory in Japan, by the aid of the current\r\nwhich sets up the two southern routes. One of these is from the\r\nsouthwest of Kyushu via the Goto Islands to southeastern China; the\r\nother is from the south of Kyushu via the Ryukyu Islands, Formosa,\r\nand the Philippines to Malaysia and Polynesia. It has also been\r\nproved geologically* that the islands now forming Japan must at one\r\ntime have been a part of the Asiatic continent. Evidently these\r\nvarious avenues may have given access to immigrants from Siberia,\r\nfrom China, from Malaysia, and from Polynesia.\r\n\r\n*There have been found in the gravel Tertiary mammals including\r\nelephas primigenius, elephas Namadicus, stegodon Clifti, and unnamed\r\nvarieties of bear, deer, bison, ox, horse, rhinoceros, and whale.\r\n(Outlines of the Geology of Japan; Imperial Geological Survey).\r\n\r\nCULTURE\r\n\r\nArchaeological research indicates the existence of two distinct\r\ncultures in Japan together with traces of a third. One of these\r\ncultures has left its relics chiefly in shell-heaps or embedded in\r\nthe soil, while the remains of another are found mainly in sepulchral\r\nchambers or in caves. The relics themselves are palpably distinct\r\nexcept when they show transitional approach to each other.\r\n\r\nThe older culture is attested by more than four thousand residential\r\nsites and shell-heaps. Its most distinctive features are the absence\r\nof all metallic objects and the presence of pottery not turned on the\r\nwheel. Polished, finely chipped, and roughly hewn implements and\r\nweapons of stone are found, as are implements of bone and horn.\r\n\r\nIt was, in short, a neolithic culture. The vestiges of the other\r\nculture do not include weapons of stone. There are imitations of\r\nsheath-knives, swords, and arrow-heads, and there are some models of\r\nstone articles. But the alien features are iron weapons and hard\r\npottery always moulded on the wheel. Copper is present mainly in\r\nconnexion with the work of the goldsmith and the silversmith, and\r\narrow-heads, jingle-bells, mirrors, etc., are also present. The\r\nformer culture is identified as that of the aboriginal inhabitants,\r\nthe Yemishi; the latter belongs to the Yamato race, or Japanese\r\nproper. Finally, \"there are indications that a bronze culture\r\nintervened in the south between the stone and the iron phases.\"*\r\n\r\n*Munro's Prehistoric Japan.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE CULTURE\r\n\r\nThe neolithic sites occur much more frequently in the northern than\r\nin the southern half of Japan. They are, indeed, six times as\r\nnumerous on the north as on the south of a line drawn across the main\r\nisland from the coast of Ise through Orai. The neighbourhood of the\r\nsea, at heights of from thirty to three hundred feet, and the\r\nalluvial plains are their favourite positions. So far as the\r\ntechnical skill shown by the relics--especially the pottery--is\r\nconcerned, it grows higher with the latitude. The inference is that\r\nthe settlements of the aborigines in the south were made at an\r\nearlier period than those in the north; which may be interpreted to\r\nmean that whereas the stone-using inhabitants were driven back in the\r\nsouth at an early date, they held their ground in the north to a\r\ncomparatively modern era.\r\n\r\nThat is precisely what Japanese history indicates. Jimmu's conquests,\r\nwhich took place several centuries before the Christian era, carried\r\nhim as far as the Ise-Omi line, but Yamato-dake's expedition against\r\nthe Yemishi north of that line was not planned until the second\r\ncentury after Christ. Apart from the rough evidence furnished by the\r\nquality of the relics, calculations have been made of the age of an\r\nimportant shell-heap by assuming that it originally stood at the\r\nseaside, and by estimating the number of years required to separate\r\nit by the present interval from the coast at a fixed annual rate of\r\nsilting. The result is from five thousand to ten thousand years. A\r\nbook (the Hitachi Fudoki), published in A.D. 715, speaks of these\r\nkaizuka (shell-heaps) as existing already at that remote period, and\r\nattributes their formation to a giant living on a hill who stretched\r\nout his hand to pick up shell-fish. This myth remained current until\r\nthe eighteenth century, and stone axes exhumed from the heaps were\r\ncalled thunder-axes (rai-fu) just as similar relics in Europe were\r\ncalled elf-bolts or thunder-stones.\r\n\r\nThere is great diversity of size among the shell-heaps, some being of\r\ninsignificant dimensions and others extending to five hundred square\r\nyards. They are most numerous in the eight provinces forming the\r\nKwanto. In fact, in these ancient times, the Yamato race and the\r\naborigines had their headquarters in the same localities,\r\nrespectively, as the Imperial and Feudal governments had in mediaeval\r\nand modern times. But there are no distinct traces of palaeolithic\r\nculture; the neolithic alone can be said to be represented. Its\r\nrelics are numerous--axes, knives, arrow-heads, arrow-necks,\r\nbow-tips, spear-heads, batons, swords, maces, sling-stones, needles,\r\ndrill-bows, drill and spindle weights, mortars and pestles, paddles,\r\nboats, sinkers, fishing-hooks, gaffs, harpoons, mallets, chisels,\r\nscrapers, hoes, sickles, whetstones, hammers, and drills.\r\n\r\nIt must be premised that though so many kinds of implements are here\r\nenumerated, the nomenclature cannot be accepted as universally\r\naccurate. The so-called \"hoe,\" for example, is an object of disputed\r\nidentity, especially as agriculture has not been proved to have been\r\npractised among the primitive people of Japan, nor have any traces of\r\ngrain been found in the neolithic sites. On the other hand, the\r\nmodern Ainu, who are believed to represent the ancient population,\r\ninclude in their religious observances the worship of the first cakes\r\nmade from the season's millet, and unless that rite be supposed to\r\nhave been borrowed from the Yamato, it goes to indicate agricultural\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, one great obstacle to any confident differentiation\r\nof the customs and creeds prevalent in Japan. That obstacle consists\r\nin the great length of the period covered by the annals. It may\r\nreasonably be assumed that the neolithic aborigines were in more or\r\nless intimate contact with the invading Yamato for something like\r\ntwenty-five centuries, an interval quite sufficient to have produced\r\nmany interactions and to have given birth to many new traditions. An\r\nillustration is furnished by the mental attitude of the uneducated\r\nclasses in Japan towards the neolithic implements. So completely has\r\nall memory of the human uses of these implements faded, that they are\r\nregarded as relics of supernatural beings and called by such names as\r\nraifu (thunder-axe), raitsui (thunder-club), kitsune no kuwa\r\n(fox-hoe), raiko (thunder-pestle), and tengu no meshigai (rice-spoon\r\nof the goblins). Many of the neolithic relics show that the people\r\nwho used them had reached a tolerably high level of civilization.\r\n\r\nThis is specially seen in the matter of ceramics. It is true that the\r\nwheel was not employed, and that the firing was imperfect, but the\r\nvariety of vessels was considerable,* and the shapes and decorations\r\nwere often very praiseworthy. Thus, among the braziers are found\r\nshapes obviously the originals of the Japanese choji-buro\r\n(clove-censer) and the graceful rice-bowl, while community of\r\nconception with Chinese potters would seem to be suggested by some of\r\nthe forms of these ancient vases. Particularly interesting are\r\nearthenware images obtained from these neolithic sites. Many of them\r\nhave been conventionalized into mere anthropomorphs and are rudely\r\nmoulded. But they afford valuable indications of the clothing and\r\npersonal adornments of the aborigines.\r\n\r\n*Cooking-pots and pans, jars and vases, bowls and dishes, cups,\r\nbottles, nipple pots, lamps, braziers, ewers, strainers, spindles or\r\ndrill weights, stamps, ornaments, images, and plaques (Munro's\r\nPrehistoric Japan).\r\n\r\nWhat end these effigies were intended to serve remains an unsettled\r\nquestion. Some suggest that they were used as substitutes for human\r\nsacrifices, and that they point to a time when wives and slaves were\r\nrequired to follow their husbands and masters to the grave. They may\r\nalso have been suggested by the example of the Yamato, who, at a very\r\nremote time, began to substitute clay images for human followers of\r\nthe dead; or they may have been designed to serve as mere mementoes.\r\nThis last theory derives some force from the fact that the images are\r\nfound, not in graves or tombs, but at residential sites. No data have\r\nbeen obtained, however, for identifying burying-places: sepulture may\r\nhave been carried out in the house of the deceased. Whichever\r\nexplanation be correct, the fact confronts us that these clay\r\neffigies have no place in the cult of the modern Ainu. History\r\nteaches, however, that degeneration may become so complete as to\r\ndeprive a nation of all traces of its original civilization. Such\r\nseems to have been the case with the Ainu.\r\n\r\nINTERMEDIATE CULTURE\r\n\r\nTraces of a culture occupying a place intermediate between the\r\nprimitive culture and that of the Yamato are not conclusive. They are\r\nseen in pottery which, like the ware of the neolithic sites, is not\r\nturned on the wheel, and, like the Yamato ware, is decorated in a\r\nvery subdued and sober fashion. It is found from end to end of the\r\nmain island and even in Yezo, and in pits, shell-heaps, and\r\nindependent sites as well as in tombs, burial caves, and cairns of\r\nthe Yamato. Thus, there does not seem to be sufficient warrant for\r\nassociating it with a special race. It was possibly supplied to order\r\nof the Yamato by the aboriginal craftsmen, who naturally sought to\r\ncopy the salient features of the conquering immigrants' ware.\r\n\r\nBRONZE VESTIGES\r\n\r\nThere are also some bronze vestiges to which considerable interest\r\nattaches, for evidently people using bronze weapons could not have\r\nstood against men carrying iron arms, and therefore the people to\r\nwhom the bronze implements belonged must have obtained a footing in\r\nJapan prior to the Yamato, unless they came at the latter's\r\ninvitation or as their allies. Moreover, these bronze relics--with\r\nthe exception of arrow-heads--though found in the soil of western and\r\nsouthern Japan, do not occur in the Yamato sepulchres, which feature\r\nconstitutes another means of differentiation. Daggers, swords,\r\nhalberds, and possibly spear-heads constitute the hand-weapons. The\r\ndaggers have a certain resemblance to the Malay kris, and the swords\r\nand halberds are generally leaf-shaped. But some features, as\r\novershort tangs and unpierced loops, suggest that they were\r\nmanufactured, not for service in battle but for ceremonial purposes,\r\nbeing thus mere survivals from an era when their originals were in\r\nactual use, and possibly those originals may have been of iron. Some\r\nstraight-edged specimens have been classed as spear-heads, but they\r\nclosely resemble certain ancient bronze swords of China. As for\r\nbronze arrow-heads, they occur alike in Yamato sepulchres and in the\r\nsoil, so that no special inference is warranted in their case. The\r\nbronze hand-weapons have been found in twelve provinces of southern\r\nand western Japan: namely, five provinces of northwest Kyushu; three\r\non the Inland Sea; one facing Korea and China, and the rest on the\r\nislands of Iki and Tsushima.\r\n\r\nThese localities and the fact that similar swords have been met with\r\nin Shantung, suggest that the bronze culture came from central and\r\neastern Asia, which hypothesis receives confirmation from the\r\ncomplete absence of bronze vestiges in the southern provinces of\r\nKyushu, namely, Osumi and Satsuma. Bronze bells, of which there are\r\nmany, belong to a separate page of archaeology. Though they have been\r\nfound in no less than twenty-four provinces, there is no instance of\r\ntheir presence in the same sites with hand-weapons of bronze. In\r\nKyushu, Higo is the only province where they have been seen, whereas\r\nin the main island they extend as far east as Totomi, and are\r\nconspicuously numerous in that province and its neighbour, Mikawa,\r\nwhile in Omi they are most abundant of all. They vary in height from\r\nabout one foot four inches to four and a half feet, and are of highly\r\nspecialized shape, the only cognate type being bells used in China\r\nduring the Chou dynasty (1122-225 B.C.) for the purpose of giving\r\nmilitary signals. A Chinese origin is still more clearly indicated by\r\nthe decorative designs, which show a combination of the circle, the\r\ntriangle, and the spiral, obviously identical with the decorative\r\nmotive* on Chinese drums of the Han dynasty (202 B.C.-A.D. 220). The\r\ncircle and the triangle occur also in the sepulchral pottery of the\r\nYamato sites, and considering the fact together with the abundance of\r\nthe bells in districts where the Yamato were most strongly\r\nestablished, there seems to be warrant for attributing these curious\r\nrelics to the Yamato culture.\r\n\r\n*This resemblance has been pointed out by a Japanese archaeologist,\r\nMr. Teraishi. Dr. Munro states that the same elements are combined in\r\nan Egyptian decorative design.\r\n\r\nTo this inference it has been objected that no bells have been found\r\nin the tombs of the Yamato. The same is true, however, of several\r\nother objects known to have belonged to that people. If, then, the\r\nbells be classed as adjuncts of the Yamato culture, shall we be\r\njustified in assigning the bronze weapon to a different race? On the\r\nwhole, the most reasonable conclusion seems to be that all the bronze\r\nrelics, weapons, and bells alike, are \"vestiges of the Yamato\r\nprocession at a time anterior to the formation of the great dolmens\r\nand other tombs\" [Munro]. A corollary would be that the Yamato\r\nmigrated from China in the days of the Chou dynasty (1122-225 B.C.),\r\nand that, having landed in the province of Higo, they conquered the\r\ngreater part of Tsukushi (Kyushu), and subsequently passed up the\r\nInland Sea to Yamato; which hypothesis would invest with some\r\naccuracy the date assigned by the Chronicles to Jimmu's expedition\r\nand would constitute a general confirmation of the Japanese account\r\nof his line of advance.\r\n\r\nYAMATO CULTURE\r\n\r\nThe ancient Yamato are known chiefly through the medium of relics\r\nfound in their sepulchres. Residential sites exist in comparatively\r\nsmall numbers, so far as research ha hitherto shown, and such sites\r\nyield nothing except more or less scattered potsherds and low walls\r\nenclosing spaces of considerable area. Occasionally Yamato pottery\r\nand other relics are discovered in pits, and these evidences,\r\ncombined with historical references, go to show that the Yamato\r\nthemselves sometimes used pit-dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe tombs yield much more suggestive relics of metal, stone, and\r\npottery. Some four thousand of such sepulchres have been officially\r\ncatalogued, but it is believed that fully ten times that number\r\nexist. The most characteristic is a tomb of larger dimensions\r\nenclosing a dolmen which contains a coffin hollowed out from the\r\ntrunk of a tree, or a sarcophagus of stone,* the latter being much\r\nmore commonly found, as might be expected from its greater\r\ndurability. Burial-jars were occasionally used, as were also\r\nsarcophagi of clay or terracotta,** the latter chiefly in the\r\nprovinces of Bizen and Mimasaka, probably because suitable materials\r\nexisted there in special abundance. Moreover, not a few tombs\r\nbelonged to the category of cists; that is to say, excavations in\r\nrock, with a single-slabbed or many-slabbed cover; or receptacles\r\nformed with stone clubs, cobbles, or boulders.\r\n\r\n*The stone sarcophagus was of considerable size and various shapes,\r\nforming an oblong box with a lid of a boatlike form.\r\n\r\n**The terracotta sarcophagi were generally parallel, oblong or\r\nelongated oval in shape, with an arched or angular covering and\r\nseveral feet. One has been found with doors moving on hinges.\r\n\r\nThere is great difficulty in arriving at any confident estimate of\r\nage amid such variety. Dolmens of a most primitive kind \"exist side\r\nby side with stone chambers of highly finished masonry in\r\ncircumstances which suggest contemporaneous construction\" so that\r\n\"the type evidently furnishes little or no criterion of age,\" and,\r\nmoreover, local facilities must have largely influenced the method of\r\nbuilding. The dolmen is regarded by archaeologists as the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of the Yamato tombs. It was a chamber formed\r\nby setting up large slabs of stone, inclined slightly towards each\r\nother, which served as supports for another slab forming the roof.\r\nSeen in plan, the dolmens presented many shapes: a simple chamber or\r\ngallery; a chamber with a gallery, or a series of chambers with a\r\ngallery. Above the dolmen a mound was built, sometimes of huge\r\ndimensions (as, for example, the misasagi* of the Emperor Tenchi--d.\r\nA.D. 671--which with its embankments, measured 5040 feet square), and\r\nwithin the dolmen were deposited many articles dedicated to the\r\nservice of the deceased. Further, around the covering-mound there are\r\ngenerally found, embedded in the earth, terracotta cylinders\r\n(haniwa), sometimes surmounted with figures or heads of persons or\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n*By this name all the Imperial tombs were called.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Chronicles, incidents so shocking occurred in\r\nconnexion with the sacrifice of the personal attendants* of Prince\r\nYamato at his burial (A.D. 2) that the custom of making such\r\nsacrifices was thenceforth abandoned, clay images being substituted\r\nfor human beings. The Records speak of a \"hedge of men set up round a\r\ntumulus,\" and it would therefore seem that these terracotta figures\r\nusually found encircling the principal misasagi, represented that\r\nhedge and served originally as pedestals for images. Within the\r\ndolmen, also, clay effigies are often found, which appear to have\r\nbeen substitutes for retainers of high rank. Had the ancient custom\r\nbeen effectually abolished in the year A.D. 3, when the Emperor\r\nSuinin is recorded to have issued orders in that sense, a simple and\r\nconclusive means would be at hand for fixing the approximate date of\r\na dolmen, since all tombs containing clay effigies or encircled by\r\nterracotta haniwa would necessarily be subsequent to that date, and\r\nall tombs containing skeletons other than the occupants of the\r\nsarcophagi would be referable to an earlier era. But although\r\ncompulsory sacrifices appear to have ceased from about the first\r\ncentury of the Christian era, it is certain that voluntary sacrifices\r\ncontinued through many subsequent ages. This clue is therefore\r\nillusory. Neither does the custom itself serve to connect the Yamato\r\nwith any special race, for it is a wide-spread rite of animistic\r\nreligion, and it was practised from time immemorial by the Chinese,\r\nthe Manchu Tatars, and many other nations of northeastern Asia.\r\n\r\n*They are said to have been buried upright in the precincts of the\r\nmisasagi. \"For several days they died not, but wept and wailed day\r\nand night. At last they died and rotted. Dogs and crows gathered and\r\nate them.\" (Chronicles. Aston's translation.)\r\n\r\nThe substitution of images for living beings, however, appears to\r\nhave been a direct outcome of contact with China, for the device was\r\nknown there as early as the seventh century before Christ. It would\r\nseem, too, from the researches of a learned Japanese archaeologist\r\n(Professor Miyake), that the resemblance between Japanese and Chinese\r\nburial customs was not limited to this substitution. The dolmen also\r\nexisted in China in very early times, but had been replaced by a\r\nchamber of finished masonry not later than the ninth century B.C. In\r\nthe Korean peninsula the dolmen with a megalithic roof is not\r\nuncommon, and the sepulchral pottery bears a close resemblance to\r\nthat of the Yamato tombs. It was at one time supposed that the highly\r\nspecialized form of dolmen found in Japan had no counterpart anywhere\r\non the continent of Asia, but that supposition has proved erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the sepulchres, however, are more distinctive. They\r\nconsist of \"noble weapons and armour, splendid horse-trappings,\r\nvessels for food and drink, and various objects de luxe,\" though\r\narticles of wood and textile fabrics have naturally perished. Iron\r\nswords are the commonest relics. They are found in all tombs of all\r\nages, and they bear emphatic testimony to the warlike habits of the\r\nYamato, as well as to their belief that in the existence beyond the\r\ngrave weapons were not less essential than in life. Arrow-heads are\r\nalso frequently found and spear-heads sometimes.* The swords are all\r\nof iron. There is no positive evidence showing that bronze swords\r\nwere in use, though grounds exist for supposing, as has been already\r\nnoted, that they were employed at a period not much anterior to the\r\ncommencement of dolmen building, which seems to have been about the\r\nsixth or seventh century before Christ. The iron swords themselves\r\nappear to attest this, for although the great majority are\r\nsingle-edged and of a shape essentially suited to iron, about ten per\r\ncent, are double-edged with a central ridge distinctly reminiscent of\r\ncasting in fact, a hammered-iron survival of a bronze leaf-shaped\r\nweapon.** Occasionally these swords have, at the end of the tang, a\r\ndisc with a perforated design of two dragons holding a ball, a\r\ndecorative motive which already betrays Chinese origin. Other swords\r\nhave pommels surmounted by a bulb set at an angle to the tang,*** and\r\nhave been suspected to be Turanian origin.\r\n\r\n*The most comprehensive list of these objects is that given in\r\nMunro's Prehistoric Japan: \"Objects of iron--(1), Swords and daggers;\r\n(2), Hilt-guards and pommels; (3), Arrow-heads; (4), Spear-heads and\r\nhalberd-heads; (5) Armour and helmets; (6), Stirrups and bridle-bits;\r\n(7), Ornamental trappings for horses; (8), Axes, hoes, or chisels;\r\n(9), Hoes or spades; (10), Chains; (11), Rings; (12), Buckles; (13),\r\nSmith's tongs or pincers; (14), Nails; (15), Caskets, handles,\r\nhinges, and other fittings. Objects of copper and bronze--(1),\r\nArrow-heads; (2), Spear-heads; (3), Hilt-guards and pommels; (4),\r\nScabbard-covers and pieces of sheet-copper for ornamental uses; (5),\r\nHelmets; (6), Arm-and-leg guards; (7), Shoes; (8), Horse-trappings;\r\n(9), Belts; (10), Mirrors; (11), Bracelets and rings; (12), Various\r\nfittings. Silver and gold were employed chiefly in plating, but fine\r\nchains and pendants as well as rings of pure gold and silver have\r\nbeen met with.\r\n\r\n\"The stone objects may be divided into two classes, viz:\r\n\r\n\"A. Articles of use or ornaments--(1), Head-rest; (2), Mortar and\r\npestle; (3), Caskets and vessels; (4), Cups and other vessels; (5),\r\nBracelets; (6), Magatama; (7), Other ornaments; (8), Plumb-line\r\npendant; (9), Spindle-weight; (10), Objects of unascertained\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n\"B. Sepulchral substitutes--(1), Swords and daggers; (2),\r\nSheath-knife; (3), Arrow-head; (4), Spear-head; (5), Shield; (6);\r\nArmour; (7), Wooden dogs; (8), Mirror; (9), Comb; (10), Magatama;\r\n(11), Cooking-knife; (12), Sickle or scythe-blade; (13), Hoe or\r\nchisel; (14), Head of chisel or spear; (15), Bowl; (16), Table; (17),\r\nSword-pommel; (18), Nondescript objects.\" The above list does not\r\ninclude pottery.\r\n\r\n**The leaf-shaped bronze sword is found over all Europe from the\r\nMediterranean to Lapland, but generally without a central ridge.\r\n\r\n***Mr. Takahashi, a Japanese archaeologist, suggests that these\r\nweapons were the so called \"mallet-headed swords\" said to have been\r\nused by Keiko's soldiers (A.D. 82) against the Tsuchi-gumo. The name,\r\nkabutsuchi, supports this theory, kabu being the term for \"turnip,\"\r\nwhich is also found in kabuya, a humming arrow having a turnip-shaped\r\nhead perforated with holes.\r\n\r\nYet another form--found mostly in the Kwanto provinces and to the\r\nnorth of them, from which fact its comparatively recent use may be\r\ninferred--was known in western Asia and especially in Persia, whence\r\nit is supposed to have been exported to the Orient in connexion with\r\nthe flourishing trade carried on between China and Persia from the\r\nseventh to the tenth century. That a similar type is not known to\r\nexist in China proves nothing conclusive, for China's attitude\r\ntowards foreign innovations was always more conservative than\r\nJapan's. Scabbards, having been mostly of wood, have not survived,\r\nbut occasionally one is found having a sheeting of copper thickly\r\nplated with gold. Arrow-heads are very numerous. Those of bronze\r\nhave, for the most part, the leaf shape of the bronze sword, but\r\nthose of iron show many forms, the most remarkable being the\r\nchisel-headed, a type used in Persia.\r\n\r\nSpear-heads are not specially suggestive as to provenance, with the\r\nexception of a kind having a cross-arm like the halberd commonly used\r\nin China from the seventh century before Christ. Yamato armour\r\naffords little assistance to the archaeologist: it bears no\r\nparticularly close resemblance to any type familiar elsewhere. There\r\nwas a corset made of sheet iron, well rivetted. It fastened in front\r\nand was much higher behind than before, additioned protection for the\r\nback being provided by a lattice-guard which depended from the helmet\r\nand was made by fastening strips of sheet iron to leather or cloth.\r\nThe helmet was usually of rivetted iron, but occasionally of bronze,\r\nwith or without a peak in front. There were also guards of copper or\r\niron for the legs, and there were shoulder-curtains constructed in\r\nthe same manner as the back-curtain pendant from the helmet. Shoes of\r\ncopper complete the panoply.\r\n\r\nThe workmanship of these weapons and armour is excellent: it shows an\r\nadvanced stage of manufacturing skill. This characteristic is even\r\nmore remarkable in the case of horse-trappings. The saddle and\r\nstirrups, the bridle and bit, are practically the same as those that\r\nwere used in modern times, even a protective toe-piece for the\r\nstirrup being present. A close resemblance is observable between the\r\nring stirrups of old Japan and those of mediaeval Europe, and a much\r\ncloser affinity is shown by the bits, which had cheek-pieces and were\r\nusually jointed in the centre precisely like a variety common in\r\nEurope; metal pendants, garnished with silver and gold and carrying\r\nglobular jingle-bells in their embossed edges, served for horse\r\ndecoration. These facts are learned, not from independent relics\r\nalone, but also from terracotta steeds found in the tumuli and\r\nmoulded so as to show all their trappings.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of expert iron-work have also survived; as chains, rings\r\nand, buckles, which differ little from corresponding objects in\r\nEurope at the present day; and the same is true of nails, handles,\r\nhinges, and other fittings. Tools used in working metal are rarely\r\nfound, a fact easily accounted for when we remember that such objects\r\nwould naturally be excluded from sepulchres.\r\n\r\nThere is another important relic which shows that the Yamato were\r\n\"indebted to China for the best specimens of their decorative art.\"\r\nThis is a round bronze mirror, of which much is heard in early\r\nJapanese annals from the time of Izanagi downwards. In China the art\r\nof working in bronze was known and practised during twenty centuries\r\nprior to the Christian era; but although Japan seems to have\r\npossessed the knowledge at the outset of the dolmen epoch, (circ. 600\r\nB.C.), she had no copper mine of her own until thirteen centuries\r\nlater, and was obliged to rely on Korea for occasional supplies. This\r\nmust have injuriously affected her progress in the art of bronze\r\ncasting.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in almost all the dolmens and later tombs mirrors of\r\nbronze were placed. This custom came into vogue in China at an early\r\ndate, the mirror being regarded as an amulet against decay or a\r\nsymbol of virtue. That Japan borrowed the idea from her neighbour can\r\nscarcely be doubted. She certainly procured many Chinese mirrors,\r\nwhich are easily distinguished by finely executed and beautiful\r\ndecorative designs in low relief on their backs; whereas her own\r\nmirrors--occasionally of iron--did not show equal skill of technique\r\nor ornamentation. Comparative roughness distinguished them, and they\r\nhad often a garniture of jingle-bells (suzu) cast around the rim, a\r\nfeature not found in Chinese mirrors. They were, in fact, an inferior\r\ncopy of a Chinese prototype, the kinship of the two being further\r\nattested by the common use of the dragon as a decorative motive.\r\nBronze vases and bowls, simple or covered, are occasionally found in\r\nthe Yamato sepulchres. Sometimes they are gilt, and in no case do\r\ntheir shapes differentiate them from Chinese or modern Japanese\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that in the field of personal ornament some\r\nspecial features peculiar to the Yamato civilization should present\r\nthemselves. There is none. Bronze or copper bracelets,* closed or\r\nopen and generally gilt, recall the Chinese bangle precisely, except\r\nwhen they are cast with a garniture of suzu. In fact, the suzu\r\n(jingle-bell) seems to be one of the few objects purely of Yamato\r\norigin. It was usually globular, having its surface divided into\r\neight parts, and it served not only as part of a bangle and as a\r\npendant for horse-trappings but also as a post-bell (ekirei), which,\r\nwhen carried by nobles and officials, indicated their right to\r\nrequisition horses for travelling purposes.\r\n\r\n*Jasper also was employed for making bracelets, and there is some\r\nevidence that shells were similarly used.\r\n\r\nTo another object interest attaches because of its wide use in\r\nwestern Asia and among the Celtic peoples of Europe. This is the\r\npenannular (or open) ring. In Europe, it was usually of solid gold or\r\nsilver, but in Japan, where these metals were very scarce in early\r\ndays, copper, plated with beaten gold or silver, was the material\r\ngenerally employed. Sometimes these rings were hollow and sometimes,\r\nbut very rarely, flattened. The smaller ones seem to have served as\r\nearrings, worn either plain or with pendants.\r\n\r\nProminent among personal ornaments were magatama (curved jewels) and\r\nkudatama (cylindrical jewels). It is generally supposed that the\r\nmagatama represented a tiger's claw, which is known to have been\r\nregarded by the Koreans as an amulet. But the ornament may also have\r\ntaken its comma-like shape from the Yo and the Yin, the positive and\r\nthe negative principles which by Chinese cosmographists were\r\naccounted the great primordial factors, and which occupy a prominent\r\nplace in Japanese decorative art as the tomoye.* The cylindrical\r\njewels evidently owed their shape to facility for stringing into\r\nnecklaces or chaplets. The Chronicles and the Records alike show that\r\nthese jewels, especially the magatama, acted an important part in\r\nsome remarkable scenes in the mythological age.** Moreover, a sword,\r\na mirror, and a magatama, may be called the regalia of Japan. But\r\nthese jewels afford little aid in identifying the Yamato. Some of\r\nthem--those of jade, chrysoprase, and nephrite***--must have been\r\nimported, these minerals never having been found in Japan. But the\r\nlatter fact, though it may be held to confirm the continental origin\r\nof the Yamato, gives no indication as to the part of Asia whence they\r\nemigrated.\r\n\r\n*Professor Takashima has found magatama among the relics of the\r\nprimitive culture, but that is probably the result of imitation.\r\n\r\n**The goddess of the Sun, when awaiting the encounter with Susanoo,\r\ntwisted a complete string, eight feet long, with five hundred\r\nmagatama. Lesser Kami were created by manipulating the jewels. When\r\nAmaterasu retired into a cave, magatama were hung from the branches\r\nof a sakaki tree to assist in enticing her out. Several other\r\nreverential allusions are made to the jewels in later times.\r\n\r\n***The jewels were of jasper, agate, chalcedony, serpentine,\r\nnephrite, steatite, quartz, crystal, glass, jade (white and green),\r\nand chrysoprase. Mention is also made of rakan, but the meaning of\r\nthe term is obscure. Probably it was a variety of jade.\r\n\r\nYAMATO POTTERY\r\n\r\nThe pottery found in the Yamato tombs is somewhat more instructive\r\nthan the personal ornaments. It seems to have been specially\r\nmanufactured, or at any rate selected, for purposes of sepulture, and\r\nit evidently retained its shape and character from very remote if not\r\nfrom prehistoric times. Known in Japan as iwaibe (sacred utensils),\r\nit resembles the pottery of Korea so closely that identity has been\r\naffirmed by some archaeologists and imitation by others. It has\r\ncomparatively fine paste--taking the primitive pottery as\r\nstandard--is hard, uniformly baked, has a metallic ring, varies in\r\ncolour from dark brown to light gray, is always turned on the wheel,\r\nhas only accidental glaze, and is decorated in a simple, restrained\r\nmanner with conventionalized designs. The shapes of the various\r\nvessels present no marked deviation from Chinese or Korean models,\r\nexcept that, the tazzas and occasionally other utensils are sometimes\r\npierced in triangular, quadrilateral, and circular patterns, to which\r\nvarious meanings more or less fanciful have been assigned.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one curious form of iwaibe which does not appear\r\nto have any counterpart in China or Korea. It is a large jar, or\r\ntazza, having several small jars moulded around its shoulder,* these\r\nsmall jars being sometimes interspersed with, and sometimes wholly\r\nreplaced by, figures of animals.** It is necessary to go to the\r\nEtruscan \"black ware\" to find a parallel to this most inartistic kind\r\nof ornamentation.\r\n\r\n*This style of ornamentation was called komochi (child-bearing), the\r\nsmall jars being regarded as children of the large.\r\n\r\n**Mr. Wakabayashi, a Japanese archaeologist, has enumerated seven\r\nvarieties of figures thus formed on vases: horses, deer, wild boars,\r\ndogs, birds, tortoises; and human beings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general decorative methods of the iwaibe potters,\r\nit is noticeable, first, that apparent impressions of textiles are\r\nfound (they are seldom actual imprints, being usually imitations of\r\nsuch), and, secondly, that simple line decoration replaces the rude\r\npictorial representations of a primitive culture and suggests\r\npropagation from a centre of more ancient and stable civilization\r\nthan that of the Yamato hordes: from China, perhaps from Korea--who\r\nknows? As for the terracotta figures of human beings and sometimes of\r\nanimals found in connexion with Yamato sepulchres, they convey little\r\ninformation about the racial problem.* The idea of substituting such\r\nfigures for the human beings originally obliged to follow the dead to\r\nthe grave seems to have come from China, and thus constitutes another\r\nevidence of intercourse, at least, between the two countries from\r\nvery ancient times.\r\n\r\n*Chinese archaic wine-pots of bronze sometimes have on the lid\r\nfigures of human beings and animals, but these served a useful\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that \"the faces seen on these images by no means\r\npresent a typical Mongolian type; on the contrary, they might easily\r\npass for European faces, and they prompt the query whether the Yamato\r\nwere not allied to the Caucasian race.\" Further, \"the national\r\nvestiges of the Yamato convey an impression of kinship to the\r\ncivilization which we are accustomed to regard as our own, for their\r\nintimate familiarity with the uses of swords, armour, horse-gear, and\r\nso forth brings us into sympathetic relation to their civilization.\"\r\n[Munro.]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that archaeology, while it discloses\r\nto us the manners and customs of the ancient inhabitants of Japan,\r\ndoes not afford material for clearly differentiating more than three\r\ncultures: namely, the neolithic culture of the Yemishi; the iron\r\nculture of the Yamato, and the intermediate bronze culture of a race\r\nnot yet identified. There are no archaeological traces of the\r\nexistence of the Kumaso or the Tsuchi-gumo, and however probable it\r\nmay seem, in view of the accessibility of Japan from the mainland,\r\nnot only while she formed part of the latter but even after the two\r\nhad become separate, that several races co-existed with the Yemishi\r\nand that a very mixed population carried on the neolithic culture,\r\nthere is no tangible evidence that such was the case. Further, the\r\nindications furnished by mythology that the Yamato were\r\nintellectually in touch with central, if not with western Asia, are\r\nre-enforced by archaeological suggestions of a civilization and even\r\nof physical traits cognate with the Caucasian.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DRUM AND MASK\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"NO\" MASKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE\r\n\r\nHOWEVER numerous may have been the races that contributed originally\r\nto people Japan, the languages now spoken there are two only, Ainu\r\nand Japanese. They are altogether independent tongues. The former\r\nundoubtedly was the language of the Yemishi; the latter, that of the\r\nYamato. From north to south all sections of the Japanese nation--the\r\nAinu of course excepted--use practically the same speech. Varieties\r\nof local dialects exist, but they show no traits of survival from\r\ndifferent languages. On the contrary, in few countries of Japan's\r\nmagnitude does corresponding uniformity of speech prevail from end to\r\nend of the realm. It cannot reasonably be assumed that, during a\r\nperiod of some twenty-five centuries and in the face of steady\r\nextermination, the Yemishi preserved their language quite distinct\r\nfrom that of their conquerors, whereas the various languages spoken\r\nby the other races peopling the island were fused into a whole so\r\nhomogeneous as to defy all attempts at differentiation. The more\r\ncredible alternative is that from time immemorial the main elements\r\nof the Japanese nation belonged to the same race, and whatever they\r\nreceived from abroad by way of immigration became completely absorbed\r\nand assimilated in the course of centuries.\r\n\r\nNo diligent attempt has yet been made to trace the connexion--if any\r\nexist--between the Ainu tongue and the languages of northeastern\r\nAsia, but geology, history, and archaeology suffice to indicate that\r\nthe Yemishi reached Japan at the outset from Siberia. The testimony\r\nof these three sources is by no means so explicit in the case of the\r\nYamato, and we have to consider whether the language itself does not\r\nfurnish some better guide. \"Excepting the twin sister tongue spoken\r\nin the Ryukyu Islands,\" writes Professor Chamberlain, \"the Japanese\r\nlanguage has no kindred, and its classification under any of the\r\nrecognized linguistic families remains doubtful. In structure, though\r\nnot to any appreciable extent in vocabulary, it closely resembles\r\nKorean, and both it and Korean may possibly be related to Mongol and\r\nto Manchu, and might therefore lay claim to be included in the\r\nso-called 'Altaic group' In any case, Japanese is what philologists\r\ncall an agglutinative tongue; that is to say, it builds up its words\r\nand grammatical forms by means of suffixes loosely soldered to the\r\nroot or stem, which is invariable.\"\r\n\r\nThis, written in 1905, has been supplemented by the ampler researches\r\nof Professor S. Kanazawa, who adduces such striking evidences of\r\nsimilarity between the languages of Japan and Korea that one is\r\nalmost compelled to admit the original identity of the two. There are\r\nno such affinities between Japanese and Chinese. Japan has borrowed\r\nlargely, very largely, from China. It could scarcely have been\r\notherwise. For whereas the Japanese language in its original form--a\r\nform which differs almost as much from its modern offspring as does\r\nItalian from Latin--has little capacity for expansion, Chinese has\r\nthe most potential of all known tongues in that respect. Chinese may\r\nbe said to consist of a vast number of monosyllables, each expressed\r\nby a different ideograph, each having a distinct significance, and\r\neach capable of combination and permutation with one or more of the\r\nothers, by which combinations and permutations disyllabic and\r\ntrisyllabic words are obtained representing every conceivable shade\r\nof meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this wonderful elasticity that Japan, when suddenly\r\nconfronted by foreign arts and sciences, soon succeeded in building\r\nup for herself a vocabulary containing all the new terms, and\r\ncontaining them in self-explaining forms. Thus \"railway\" is expressed\r\nby tetsu-do, which consists of the two monosyllables tetsu (iron) and\r\ndo (way); \"chemistry\" by kagaku, or the learning (gaku) of changes\r\n(ka); \"torpedo\" by suirai, or water (sui) thunder (rai); and each of\r\nthe component monosylables being written with an ideograph which\r\nconveys its own meaning, the student has a term not only appropriate\r\nbut also instructive. Hundreds of such words have been manufactured\r\nin Japan during the past half-century to equip men for the study of\r\nWestern learning, and the same process, though on a very much smaller\r\nscale, had been going on continuously for many centuries, so that the\r\nJapanese language has come to embody a very large number of Chinese\r\nwords, though they are not pronounced as the Chinese pronounce the\r\ncorresponding ideographs.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this intimate relation, re-enforced as it is by a\r\ncommon script, the two languages remain radically distinct; whereas\r\nbetween Japanese and Korean the resemblance of structure and\r\naccidence amounts almost to identity. Japanese philologists allege\r\nthat no affinity can be traced between their language and the tongues\r\nof the Malay, the South Sea islanders, the natives of America and\r\nAfrica, or the Eskimo, whereas they do find that their language bears\r\na distinct resemblance to Manchu, Persian, and Turkish. Some go so\r\nfar as to assert that Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit are nearer to\r\nJapanese than they are to any European language. These questions\r\nawait fuller investigation.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RACES\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are of distinctly small stature. The average height of\r\nthe man is 160 centimetres (5 feet 3.5 inches) and that of the woman\r\n147 centimetres (4 feet 10 inches). They are thus smaller than any\r\nEuropean race, the only Occidentals over whom they possess an\r\nadvantage in this respect being the inhabitants of two Italian\r\nprovinces. [Baelz.] Their neighbours, the Chinese and the Koreans,\r\nare taller, the average height of the northern Chinese being 168\r\ncentimetres (5 feet 7 inches), and that of the Koreans 164\r\ncentimetres (5 feet 5.5 inches). Nevertheless, Professor Dr. Baelz,\r\nthe most eminent authority on this subject, avers that \"the three\r\ngreat nations of eastern Asia are essentially of the same race,\" and\r\nthat observers who consider them to be distinct \"have been misled by\r\nexternal appearances.\" He adds: \"Having made a special study of the\r\nrace question in eastern Asia, I can assert that comity of race in\r\ngeneral is clearly proved by the anatomical qualities of the body. In\r\nany case the difference between them is much smaller than that\r\nbetween the inhabitants of northern and southern Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe marked differences in height, noted above, do not invalidate this\r\ndictum: they show merely that the Asiatic yellow race has several\r\nsubdivisions. Among these subdivisions the more important are the\r\nManchu-Korean type, the Mongol proper, the Malay, and the Ainu. To\r\nthe first, namely the Manchu-Korean, which predominates in north\r\nChina and in Korea, Baelz assigns the higher classes in Japan; that\r\nis to say, the men regarded as descendants of the Yamato. They have\r\n\"slender, elegant and often tall figures, elongated faces with not\r\nvery prominent cheek-bones, more or less slanting eyes, aquiline\r\nnoses, large upper teeth, receding chins, long slender necks, narrow\r\nchests, long trunks, thin limbs, and often long fingers, while the\r\nhair on the face and body is scarce.\" Dr. Munro, however, another\r\neminent authority, holds that, \"judging from the Caucasian and often\r\nSemitic physiognomy seen in the aristocratic type of Japanese, the\r\nYamato were mainly of Caucasic, perhaps Iranian, origin. These were\r\nthe warriors, the conquerors of Japan, and afterwards the\r\naristocracy, modified to some extent by mingling with a Mongoloid\r\nrank and file, and by a considerable addition of Ainu.\" He remarks\r\nthat a white skin was the ideal of the Yamato, as is proved by their\r\nancient poetry.\r\n\r\nAs for the Mongol-proper type, which is seen in the lower classes and\r\neven then not very frequently, its representative is squarely built,\r\nand has prominent cheek-bones, oblique eyes, a more or less flat nose\r\nwith a large mouth. The Malay type is much commoner. Its\r\ncharacteristics are small stature, good and sometimes square build, a\r\nface round or angular, prominent cheek-bones, large horizontal eyes,\r\na weak chin, a short neck, broad well-developed chest, short legs,\r\nand small delicate hands. As for the Ainu type, Dr. Baelz finds it\r\nastonishing that they have left so little trace in the Japanese\r\nnation. \"Yet those who have studied the pure Ainu closely will\r\nobserve, particularly in the northern provinces, a not insignificant\r\nnumber of individuals bearing the marks of Ainu blood. The most\r\nimportant marks are: a short, thickly set body; prominent bones with\r\nbushy hair, round deep-set eyes with long divergent lashes, a\r\nstraight nose, and a large quantity of hair on the face and body all\r\nqualities which bring the Ainu much nearer to the European than to\r\nthe Japanese proper.\"\r\n\r\nGENERAL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nIn addition to physical characteristics which indicate distinctions\r\nof race among the inhabitants of Japan, there are peculiarities\r\ncommon to a majority of the nation at large. One of these is an\r\nabnormally large head. In the typical European the height of the head\r\nis less than one-seventh of the stature and in Englishmen it is often\r\none-eighth. In the Japanese is it appreciably more than one-seventh.\r\nSomething of this may be attributed to smallness of stature, but such\r\nan explanation is only partial.\r\n\r\nShortness of legs in relation to the trunk is another marked feature.\r\n\"Long or short legs are mainly racial in origin. Thus, in Europe, the\r\nnorthern, or Teutonic race--namely Anglo-Saxons, North Germans,\r\nSwedes, and Danes--are tail; long-legged, and small-headed, while the\r\nAlpine, or central European race are short of stature, have short\r\nlegs and large heads with short necks, thus resembling the Mongolian\r\nrace in general, with which it was probably originally connected.\"\r\n[Baelz.]\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese face, too, there are some striking points. The first\r\nis in the osseous cavity of the eyeball and in the skin round the\r\neye. \"The socket of the Japanese eye is comparatively small and\r\nshallow, and the osseous ridges at the brows being little marked, the\r\neye is less deeply set than in the European. Seen in profile,\r\nforehead and upper lid often form one unbroken line.\" Then \"the shape\r\nof the eye proper, as modelled by the lids, shows a most striking\r\ndifference between the European and the Mongolian races; the open eye\r\nbeing almost invariably horizontal in the former but very often\r\noblique in the latter on account of the higher level of the outer\r\ncorner. But even apart from obliqueness the shape of the corner is\r\npeculiar in the Mongolian eye. The inner corner is partly or entirely\r\ncovered by a fold of the upper lid continuing more or less into the\r\nlower lid. This fold, which has been called the Mongolian fold, often\r\nalso covers the whole free rim of the upper lid, so that the\r\ninsertion of the eyelashes is hidden. When the fold takes an upward\r\ndirection towards the outer corner, the latter is a good deal higher\r\nthan the inner corner, and the result is the obliqueness mentioned\r\nabove. The eyelashes are shorter and sparser than in the European,\r\nand whereas in the European the lashes of the upper and the lower lid\r\ndiverge, so that their free ends are farther distant than their\r\nroots, in the Japanese eye they converge, the free ends being nearer\r\ntogether than the insertions. Then again in the lower class the\r\ncheek-bones are large and prominent, making the face look flat and\r\nbroad, while in the higher classes narrow and elongated faces are\r\nquite common. Finally, the Japanese is less hairy than the European,\r\nand the hair of the beard is usually straight.\" [Baelz.]\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF JAPANESE ETHNOLOGISTS\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that the problem of their nation's origin has\r\noccupied much attention among the Japanese, and that their\r\nethnologists have arrived at more or less definite conclusions. The\r\noutlines of their ideas are that one of the great waves of emigration\r\nwhich, in a remote age, emerged from the cradle of the human race in\r\ncentral Asia, made its way eastward with a constantly expanding\r\nfront, and, sweeping up the Tarim basin, emerged in the region of the\r\nYellow River and in Manchuria. These wanderers, being an\r\nagricultural, not a maritime, race, did not contribute much to the\r\npeopling of the oversea islands of Japan. But in a later--or an\r\nearlier--era, another exodus took place from the interior of Asia. It\r\nturned in a southerly direction through India, and coasting along the\r\nsouthern seaboard, reached the southeastern region of China; whence,\r\nusing as stepping-stones the chain of islands that festoon eastern\r\nAsia, it made its way ultimately to Korea and Japan.\r\n\r\nAnterior to both of these movements another race, the neolithic\r\nYemishi of the shell-heaps, had pushed down from the northeastern\r\nregions of Korea or from the Amur valley, and peopled the northern\r\nhalf of Japan. The Korean peninsula, known in Chinese records as Han,\r\nappears in the form of three kingdoms at the earliest date of its\r\nhistorical mention: they were Sin-Han and Pyon-Han on the east and\r\nMa-Han on the West. The northeastern portion, from the present\r\nWon-san to Vladivostok, bore the name of Yoso, which is supposed to\r\nhave been the original of Yezo, the Yoso region thus constituting the\r\ncradle of the Yemishi race.\r\n\r\nJapanese ethnologists interpret the ancient annals as pointing to\r\nvery close intercourse between Japan and Korea in early days,* and\r\nregard this as confirming the theory stated above as to the\r\nprovenance of the Yamato race. Connexion with the colonists of\r\nnorthern China was soon established via Manchuria, and this fact may\r\naccount for some of the similarities between the civilization as well\r\nas the legends of the Yamato and those of Europe, since there is\r\nevidence that the Greeks and Romans had some hazy knowledge of China,\r\nand that the Chinese had a similarly vague knowledge of the Roman\r\nEmpire,** possibly through commercial relations in the second century\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n*The annals state of Princes Mikeno and Inahi, elder brothers of\r\nPrince Iware (afterwards Jimmu Tenno). that the former \"crossed over\r\nto the Eternal Land\" (Tokoyo-no-kuni) and the latter went down to the\r\nsea plain, it being his deceased mother's land. Japanese\r\narchaeologists identify \"mother's land\" as Shiragi in Korea, and\r\nTokoyo-no-kuni as the western country where the sun sets, namely\r\nChina. They further point out that Susanoo with his son, Itakeru,\r\nwent to Shiragi and lived at Soshi-mori, for which reason Susanoo's\r\nposthumous title was Gozu Tenno, gozu being the Japanese equivalent\r\nfor the Korean soshi-mori (ox head). Susanoo is also quoted as\r\nsaying, \"there are gold and silver in Koma and it were well that\r\nthere should be a floating treasury;\"* so he built a vessel of pine\r\nand camphor-wood to export these treasures to Japan. The \"Korea\" here\r\nspoken of is the present Kimhai in Kyongsan-do. It is further\r\nrecorded that Susanoo lived for a time at Kumanari-mine, which is the\r\npresent Kongju. Again, a Japanese book, compiled in the tenth century\r\nA.D., enumerates six shrines in the province of Izumo which were\r\ncalled Kara-kuni Itate Jinja, or shrine of Itakeru of Korea. A much\r\nabler work, Izuma Fudoki, speaks of Cape Kitsuki in Izumo as a place\r\nwhere cotton-stuffs were imported from Shiragi by Omitsu, son of\r\nSusanoo. There are other evidences to the same effect, and taken in\r\nconjunction with the remarkable similarity of the Korean and Japanese\r\nlanguages, these facts are held to warrant the conclusion that the\r\nmost important element of the Japanese nation came via Korea, its Far\r\nEastern colony being the ultima thule of its long wanderings from\r\ncentral Asia.\r\n\r\n**See Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Vol. 6, p. 189 b.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of Japan in Chinese records is contained in a book\r\ncalled Shan-hai-ching, which states that \"the northern and southern\r\nWo* were subject to the kingdom of Yen.\" Yen was in the modern\r\nprovince of Pechili. It existed as an independent kingdom from 1 122\r\nto 265 B.C. That the inhabitants of Japan were at any time subject to\r\nYen is highly improbable, but that they were tributaries is not\r\nunlikely. In other words, intercourse between Japan and northern\r\nChina was established in remote times via the Korean peninsula, and\r\npeople from Japan, travelling by this route, carried presents to the\r\nCourt of Yen, a procedure which, in Chinese eyes constituted an\r\nacknowledgement of suzerainty. The \"northern and southern Wo\" were\r\nprobably the kingdom of Yamato and that set up in Kyushu by Ninigi, a\r\nsupposition which lends approximate confirmation to the date assigned\r\nby Japanese historians for the expedition of Jimmu Tenno. It is also\r\nrecorded in the Chronicles of the Eastern Barbarians, a work of the\r\nHan dynasty (A.D. 25-221), that Sin-Han, one of the three Korean\r\nkingdoms, produced iron, and that Wo and Ma-Han, the western of these\r\nKorean kingdoms, traded in it and used it as currency. It is very\r\npossible that this was the iron used for manufacturing the ancient\r\ndouble-edged swords (tsurugi) and halberds of the Yamato, a\r\nhypothesis strengthened by the fact that the sword of Susanoo was\r\ncalled Orochi no Kara-suki, Kara being a Japanese name for Korea.\r\n\r\n*This word was originally pronounced Wa, and is written with the\r\nideograph signifying \"dwarf.\" It was applied to the Japanese by\r\nChinese writers in earliest times, but on what ground such an epithet\r\nwas chosen there is no evidence.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: JAPANESE SADDLE, BRIDLE, AND STIRRUPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS IN REMOTE ANTIQUITY\r\n\r\nIf it be insisted that no credence attaches to traditions unsupported\r\nby written annals, then what the Records and the Chronicles, compiled\r\nin the eighth century, tell of the manners and customs of Japan\r\ntwelve or thirteen hundred years previously, must be dismissed as\r\nromance. A view so extreme is scarcely justified. There must be a\r\nfoundation of truth in works which, for the most part, have received\r\nthe imprimatur of all subsequent generations of Japanese. Especially\r\ndoes that hold as to indications of manners, customs, and\r\ninstitutions. These, at least, are likely to be mirrored with a\r\ncertain measure of accuracy, though they may often reflect an age\r\nlater than that to which they are referred, and may even have been\r\npartially moulded to suit the ideas of their narrators. In briefly\r\nepitomizing this page of history, the plan here pursued is to adhere\r\nas far as possible to Japanese interpretations, since these must of\r\nnecessity be most intelligent.\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nAt the basis of the social structure stand the trinity of Kami,\r\nmythologically called the Central Master (Naka-Nushi) and the two\r\nConstructive Chiefs (Musubi no Kami). The Central Master was the\r\nprogenitor of the Imperial family; the Constructive Chiefs were the\r\nnobility, the official class. What was originally involved in the\r\nconception of official functions, we learn from incidents prefatory\r\nto the expedition conducted by Ninigi for the subjugation of Japan.\r\nAmaterasu (the Sun goddess) attached to the person of her grandson\r\nfour chiefs and one chieftainess. To two of the former (Koyane and\r\nFutodama) she entrusted all matters relating to religious rites, and\r\nthey became respectively the ancestors of the Nakatomi and the Imibe\r\nfamilies. To the female Kami (Usume) was entrusted the making of\r\nsacred music and she founded the Sarume family. Finally, all military\r\nfunctions were committed to the chiefs, Oshihi and Kume, whose\r\ndescendants constituted the Otomo and Kume families.\r\n\r\nIn every case these offices were hereditary for all time, and the\r\nfamilies of their holders constitute the aristocracy of the nation,\r\nmarrying among themselves and filling the highest offices from\r\ngeneration to generation. Their members bore the title of hiko (son\r\nof the Sun) and hime (daughter of the Sun), and those that governed\r\ntowns and villages were called tomo no miyatsuko, while those that\r\nheld provincial domains were entitled kuni no miyatsuko.\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the Japanese polity. The descendants of\r\nAmaterasu, herself a descendant of the Central Master, occupied the\r\nthrone in unbroken succession, and the descendants of the two\r\nConstructive Chiefs served as councillors, ministers, and generals.\r\nBut the lineage of all being traceable to three chiefs who originally\r\noccupied places of almost equal elevation, they were united by a bond\r\nof the most durable nature. At the same time it appears that this\r\nequality had its disadvantage; it disposed the members of the\r\naristocratic families to usurp the administrative power while\r\nrecognizing its source, the Throne, and it encouraged factional\r\ndissensions, which sometimes resulted disastrously. As to the middle\r\nand lower classes, no evidence bearing on their exact composition is\r\nforthcoming. It is plain, however, that they accepted a subordinate\r\nposition without active protest, for nothing like a revolt on their\r\npart is alluded to, directly or indirectly, in the Records or the\r\nChronicles. The term for all subjects was tomobe.\r\n\r\nDWELLING-HOUSES\r\n\r\nThe palace of the sovereign--called miya or odono--corresponded in\r\nappearance and construction with the shrines of the deities. It was\r\nbuilt by erecting central pillars--originally merely sunk in the\r\nground but in later times having a stone foundation--from which\r\nrafters sloped to corner posts, similarly erected, the sides being\r\nclapboarded. Nails were used, but the heavy timbers were tied\r\ntogether with ropes made by twisting the fibrous stems of climbing\r\nplants. A conspicuous feature was that the upper ends of the rafters\r\nprojected across each other, and in the V-shaped receptacle thus\r\nformed, a ridge-pole was laid with a number of short logs crossing it\r\nat right angles. This disposition of timbers was evidently devised to\r\nfacilitate tying and to impart stability to the thatch, which was\r\nlaid to a considerable thickness.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain whether in the earliest times floors were fully\r\nboarded, or whether boarding was confined to a dais running round the\r\nsides, the rest of the interior being of beaten mud. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, the whole floor was boarded. Chimneys were not provided;\r\ncharcoal being the principal fuel, its smoke did not incommode, and\r\nwhen firewood was employed, the fumes escaped through openings in the\r\ngable. For windows there were holes closed by shutters which, like\r\nthe doors, swung upon hooks and staples. Rugs of skin or of rush\r\nmatting served to spread on the boarded floor, and in rare cases silk\r\ncushions were employed.\r\n\r\nThe areas on which buildings stood were generally surrounded by\r\npalisades, and for a long time no other kind of defence save these\r\npalings seems to have been devised. Indeed, no mention of castles\r\noccurs until the first century B.C., when the strange term\r\n\"rice-castle\" (ina-ki) is found; the reference being apparently to a\r\npalisade fortified with rice-bags, or to a rice-granary used as a\r\nfortress. The palace of the sovereign towered so high by comparison\r\nthat it was termed Asahi-no-tada-sasu-miya (miya on which the morning\r\nsun shines direct), or Yuhi-no-hiteru-miya (miya illumined by the\r\nevening sun), or some other figurative epithet, and to the Emperor\r\nhimself was applied the title 0-mikado (great august Gate). The\r\ndwellings occupied by the nobility were similarly built, though on a\r\nless pretentious scale, and those of the inferior classes appear to\r\nhave been little better than huts, not a few of them being partially\r\nsunk in the ground, as is attested by the fact that the term \"enter\"\r\ntook the form of \"creep in\" (hairu).\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION AND WORSHIP\r\n\r\nIn the instruction said to have been given by Amaterasu to her\r\ngrandson Ninigi, on the eve of his expedition to Japan, the words are\r\nrecorded: \"My child, regard this mirror as you regard me. Keep it in\r\nthe same house with yourself, and make it the mirror of purity.\"\r\nAccordingly the insignia--the mirror, the jewel, and the sword--were\r\nalways kept in the main hall of the palace under the care of the\r\nNakatomi and the Imibe families. An ancient volume (Kogo-shui)\r\nrecords that when the palace of Kashihara was reached by Jimmu's\r\narmy, the grandson of the founder of the Imibe family--cutting timber\r\nwith a consecrated axe (imi-ono) and digging foundations with a\r\nconsecrated spade (imi-suki)--constructed a palace in which he placed\r\nthe mirror, the jewel, and the sword, setting out offerings and\r\nreciting prayers to celebrate the completion of the building and the\r\ninstallation of the insignia.\r\n\r\n\"At that time the sovereign was still very close to the Kami, and the\r\narticles and utensils for the latter were little distinguished from\r\nthose for the former. Within the palace there stood a store house\r\n(imi-kura), the Imibe family discharging daily and nightly the duties\r\nrelating to it.\" Thus it is seen that in remote antiquity religious\r\nrites and administrative functions were not distinguished. The\r\nsovereign's residence was the shrine of the Kami, and the term for\r\n\"worship\" (matsuri) was synonymous with that for \"government.\"\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS RITES\r\n\r\nThe ceremony spoken of above--the Odono matsuri, or consecration of\r\nthe palace--is the earliest religious rite mentioned. Next in\r\nimportance was the \"harvest festival.\" In the records of the\r\nmythological age it is related that Amaterasu obtained seeds of the\r\n\"five cereals,\" and, recognizing their value as food, caused them to\r\nbe cultivated, offering a part to the Kami when they were ripe and\r\neating some herself. This became a yearly custom, and when Ninigi set\r\nout to conquer Japan, his grandmother gave rice seed to the ancestors\r\nof the Nakatomi and the Imibe families, who thenceforth conducted the\r\nharvest festival (nii-name, literally \"tasting the new rice\") every\r\nautumn, the sovereign himself taking part, and the head of the\r\nNakatomi reciting a prayer for the eternity of the Imperial line and\r\nthe longevity of the Emperor. Other important rites were the \"great\r\npurification\" (Oharai) performed twice a year, on the last day of the\r\nsixth month and the last day of the twelfth month; the \"fire-subduing\r\nfete,\" the \"spirit-tranquillizing fete,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOf all these rites the principal features were the recitation of\r\nrituals and the offering of various objects, edible or otherwise\r\nuseful. The rituals (norito) being, in several cases, set formulas,\r\nlent themselves with special facility to oral transmission from\r\ngeneration to generation. It is certain that they were familiar to\r\nthe compilers of the Records and the Chronicles, and they contain\r\nexpressions dating from such a remote era as to have become\r\nincomprehensible before history began to be written in Japan. In the\r\nyear A.D. 927, seventy-five of the norito were transcribed into a\r\nbook (Yengi-shiki, or Ceremonial Law) which contains, in addition to\r\nthese rituals, particulars as to the practice of the Shinto religion;\r\nas to the organization of the priesthood--which included ten virgin\r\nprincesses of the Imperial family, one each for the two great temples\r\nof Watarai in Ise and Kamo in Yamashiro--and as to the Shinto shrines\r\nqualified to receive State support. These shrines totalled 3132,\r\namong which number 737 were maintained at the Emperor's charges.\r\nConsidering that the nation at that time (tenth century) did not\r\ncomprise more than a very few millions, the familiar criticism that\r\nthe Japanese are indifferent to religion is certainly not proved by\r\nany lack of places of worship. The language of the rituals is\r\noccasionally poetic, often figurative and generally solemn,* but they\r\nare largely devoted to enumeration of Kami, to formulae of praise for\r\npast favours, to petitions for renewed assistance, and to\r\nrecapitulations of the offerings made in support of these requests.\r\nAs for the offerings, they comprise woven stuffs, and their raw\r\nmaterials, models of swords, arrows, shields, stags' antlers, hoes,\r\nfish (dried and fresh), salt, sake, and, in some cases, a horse, a\r\ncock, and a pig. In short, the things offered were essentially\r\nobjects serviceable to living beings.\r\n\r\n*The Norito of the Great Purification Service has been translated by\r\nMr. W. G. Aston in his Japanese Literature.\r\n\r\nTHE KAMI\r\n\r\nThe Kami may be broadly divided into two groups, namely, those\r\noriginally regarded as superior beings and those elevated to that\r\nrank in consideration of illustrious deeds performed during life. Of\r\nthe former group the multitudinous and somewhat heterogenous\r\ncomponents have been supposed to suggest the amalgamation of two or\r\nmore religious systems in consequence of a blending of races alien to\r\none another. But such features may be due to survivals incidental to\r\nthe highest form of nature religion, namely, anthropomorphic\r\npolytheism.\r\n\r\nThere were the numerous Kami, more or less abstract beings without\r\nany distinguishing functions, who preceded the progenitors of the\r\nYamato race, and there was the goddess of the Sun, pre-eminent and\r\nsupreme, together with deities of the Moon, of the stars, of the\r\nwinds, of the rain, of fire, of water, of mountains, of mines, of\r\nfields, of the sea, of the trees, and of the grass--the last a female\r\ndivinity (Kaya-no-hime). The second group those deified for\r\nillustrious services during life--furnished the tutelary divinities\r\n(uji-gami or ubusuna-Kami) of the localities where their families\r\nlived and where their labours had been performed. Their protection\r\nwas specially solicited by the inhabitants of the regions where their\r\nshrines stood, while the nation at large worshipped the Kami of the\r\nfirst group. Out of this apotheosis of distinguished mortals there\r\ngrew, in logical sequence, the practice of ancestor worship. It was\r\nmerely a question of degrees of tutelary power. If the blessings of\r\nprosperity and deliverance could be bestowed on the denizens of a\r\nregion by the deity enshrined there, the same benefits in a smaller\r\nand more circumscribed measure might be conferred by the deceased\r\nhead of a family. As for the sovereign, standing to the whole nation\r\nin the relation of priest and intercessor with the deities, he was\r\nhimself regarded as a sacred being, the direct descendant of the\r\nheavenly ancestor (Tenson).\r\n\r\nTHERIANTHROPIC ELEMENTS\r\n\r\nThat the religion of ancient Japan--known as Shinto, or \"the way of\r\nthe gods\"--had not fully emerged from therianthropic polytheism is\r\nproved by the fact that, though the deities were generally\r\nrepresented in human shape, they were frequently conceived as\r\nspiritual beings, embodying themselves in all kinds of things,\r\nespecially in animals, reptiles, or insects. Thus, tradition relates\r\nthat the Kami of Mimoro Mountain appeared to the Emperor Yuryaku\r\n(A.D. 457-459) in the form of a snake; that during the reign of the\r\nEmperor Keitai (A.D. 507-531), a local deity in the guise of a\r\nserpent interfered with agricultural operations and could not be\r\nplacated until a shrine was built in its honour; that in the time of\r\nthe Emperor Kogyoku, the people of the eastern provinces devoted\r\nthemselves to the worship of an insect resembling a silkworm, which\r\nthey regarded as a manifestation of the Kami of the Moon; that the\r\nEmperor Keiko (A.D. 71-130) declared a huge tree to be sacred; that\r\nin the days of the Empress Suiko (A.D. 593-628), religious rites were\r\nperformed before cutting down a tree supposed to be an incarnation of\r\nthe thunder Kami; that on the mountain Kannabi, in Izumo, there stood\r\na rock embodying the spirit of the Kami whose expulsion from Yamato\r\nconstituted the objective of Ninigi's expedition, and that prayer to\r\nit was efficacious in terminating drought, that the deity\r\nKoto-shiro-nushi became transformed into a crocodile, and that \"the\r\nhero Yamato-dake emerged from his tomb in the shape of a white swan.\"\r\n\r\nMany other cognate instances might be quoted. A belief in amulets and\r\ncharms, in revelations by dreams and in the efficacy of ordeal,\r\nbelongs to this category of superstitions. The usual form of ordeal\r\nwas by thrusting the hand into boiling water. It has been alleged\r\nthat the Shinto religion took no account of a soul or made any\r\nscrutiny into a life beyond the grave. Certainly no ideas as to\r\nplaces of future reward or punishment seem to have engrossed\r\nattention, but there is evidence that not only was the spirit (tama)\r\nrecognized as surviving the body, but also that the spirit itself was\r\nbelieved to consist of a rough element (am) and a gentle element\r\n(nigi), either of which predominated according to the nature of the\r\nfunctions to be performed; as when a nigi-tama was believed to have\r\nattached itself to the person of the Empress Jingo at the time of her\r\nexpedition to Korea, while an ara-tama formed the vanguard of her\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nSome Japanese philosophers, however--notably the renowned\r\nMotoori--have maintained that this alleged duality had reference\r\nsolely to the nature of the influence exercised by a spirit on\r\nparticular occasions. Shinto has no sacred canon like the Bible, the\r\nKoran, or the Sutras. Neither has it any code of morals or body of\r\ndogma. Cleanliness may be called its most prominent feature.\r\nIzanagi's lustrations to remove the pollution contracted during his\r\nvisit to the nether world became the prototype of a rite of\r\npurification (misogi) which always prefaced acts of worship. A\r\ncognate ceremony was the harai (atonement). By the misogi the body\r\nwas cleansed; by the harai all offences were expiated; the origin of\r\nthe latter rite having been the exaction of certain penalties from\r\nSusanoo for his violent conduct towards the Sun goddess.* The two\r\nceremonies, physical cleansing and moral cleansing, prepared a\r\nworshipper to approach the shrine of the Kami. In later times both\r\nrites were compounded into one, the misogi-harai, or simply the\r\nharai. When a calamity threatened the country or befell it, a grand\r\nharai (o-harai) was performed in atonement for the sins supposed to\r\nhave invited the catastrophe. This principle of cleanliness found\r\nexpression in the architecture of Shinto shrines; plain white wood\r\nwas everywhere employed and ornamentation of every kind eschewed. In\r\nview of the paramount importance thus attached to purity, a\r\ncelebrated couplet of ancient times is often quoted as the unique and\r\ncomplete canon of Shinto morality,\r\n\r\n*His nails were extracted and his beard was plucked out.\r\n\r\n   \"Unsought in prayer,\r\n   \"The gods will guard\r\n   \"The pure of heart.\"*\r\n\r\n   *Kokoro dani\r\n    Makoto no michi ni\r\n    Kanai naba\r\n    Inorazu tote mo\r\n    Kami ya mamoran.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, however, that Shinto cannot be included in the category\r\nof ethical religions; it belongs essentially to the family of nature\r\nreligions.\r\n\r\nCRIMES\r\n\r\nThe acts which constituted crimes in ancient Japan were divided into\r\ntwo classes: namely, sins against heaven and sins against the State.\r\nAt the head of the former list stood injuries to agricultural\r\npursuits, as breaking down the ridges of rice-fields, filling up\r\ndrains, destroying aqueducts, sowing seeds twice in the same place,\r\nputting spits in rice-fields, flaying an animal alive or against the\r\ngrain, etc. The crimes against the State were cutting and wounding\r\n(whether the living or the dead), defilement on account of leprosy or\r\ncognate diseases, unnatural offences, evil acts on the part of\r\nchildren towards parents or of parents towards children, etc. Methods\r\nof expiating crime were recognized, but, as was the universal custom\r\nin remote times, very cruel punishments were employed against\r\nevil-doers and enemies. Death was inflicted for comparatively trivial\r\noffences, and such tortures were resorted to as cutting the sinews,\r\nextracting the nails and the hair, burying alive, roasting, etc.\r\nBranding or tattooing seems to have been occasionally practised, but\r\nessentially as a penalty or a mark of ignominy.\r\n\r\nDIVINATION\r\n\r\nAs is usually the case in a nation where a nature religion is\r\nfollowed, divination and augury were practised largely in ancient\r\nJapan. The earliest method of divination was by roasting the\r\nshoulder-blade of a stag and comparing the cracks with a set of\r\ndiagrams. The Records and the Chronicles alike represent Izanagi and\r\nIzanami as resorting to this method of presaging the future, and the\r\npractice derives interest from the fact that a precisely similar\r\ncustom has prevailed in Mongolia from time immemorial. Subsequently\r\nthis device was abandoned in favour of the Chinese method, heating a\r\ntortoise-shell; and ultimately the latter, in turn, gave way to the\r\nEight Trigrams of Fuhi. The use of auguries seems to have come at a\r\nlater date. They were obtained by playing a stringed instrument\r\ncalled koto, by standing at a cross-street and watching the passers,\r\nby manipulating stones, and by counting footsteps.\r\n\r\nMILITARY FORCES\r\n\r\nIt has been related that when the \"heavenly grandson\" undertook his\r\nexpedition to Japan, the military duties were entrusted to two\r\nmikoto* who became the ancestors of the Otomo and the Kume families.\r\nThere is some confusion about the subsequent differentiation of these\r\nfamilies, but it is sufficient to know that, together with the\r\nMononobe family, they, were the hereditary repositories of military\r\nauthority. They wore armour, carried swords, spears and bows, and not\r\nonly mounted guard at the palace but also asserted the Imperial\r\nauthority throughout the provinces. No exact particulars of the\r\norganization of these forces are on record, but it would seem that\r\nthe unit was a battalion divided into twenty-five companies, each\r\ncompany consisting of five sections of five men per section, a\r\ncompany being under the command of an officer whose rank was\r\nmiyatsuko.\r\n\r\n*\"August being,\" a term of respect applied to the descendants of the\r\nKami.\r\n\r\nFINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nNo mention is made of such a thing as currency in prehistoric Japan.\r\nCommerce appears to have been conducted by barter only. In order to\r\nprocure funds for administrative and religious purposes, officers in\r\ncommand of forces were despatched to various regions, and the\r\ninhabitants were required to contribute certain quantities of local\r\nproduce. Steps were also taken to cultivate useful plants and cereals\r\nand to promote manufactures. The Kogo-shui states that a certain\r\nmikoto inaugurated the fashioning of gems in Izumo, and that his\r\ndescendants continued the work from generation to generation, sending\r\nannual tribute of articles to the Court every year. Another mikoto\r\nwas sent to plant paper-mulberry and hemp in the province of Awa (awa\r\nsignifies \"hemp\"), and a similar record is found in the same book\r\nwith regard to the provinces of Kazusa and Shimosa, which were then\r\ncomprised in a region named Fusa-kuni. Other places owed their names\r\nto similar causes.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that, whatever may have been the case at the outset, this\r\nassignment of whole regions to the control of officials whose\r\nresponsibility was limited to the collection of taxes for the uses of\r\nthe Court, could not but tend to create a provincial nobility and\r\nthus lay the foundations of a feudal system. The mythological\r\naccounts of meetings of the Kami for purposes of consultation suggest\r\na kind of commonwealth, and recall \"the village assemblies of\r\nprimitive times in many parts of the world, where the cleverness of\r\none and the general willingness to follow his suggestions fill the\r\nplace of the more definite organization of later times.\"* But though\r\nthat may be true of the Yamato race in the region of its origin, the\r\nconditions found by it in Japan were not consistent with such a\r\nsystem, for Chinese history shows that at about the beginning of the\r\nChristian era the Island Empire was in a very uncentralized state and\r\nthat the sway of the Yamato was still far from receiving general\r\nrecognition. A great Japanese scholar** has contended that the\r\ncentralization which prevailed in later ages was wholly an imitation\r\nof Chinese bureaucracy, and that organized feudalism was the original\r\nform of government in Japan. The annals appear to support that view\r\nto a limited extent, but the subject will presently be discussed at\r\ngreater length.\r\n\r\n*B. H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n**Hirata Atsutane.\r\n\r\nRAIMENT\r\n\r\nIn the use of clothing and the specialization of garments the early\r\nJapanese had reached a high level. We read in the ancient legends of\r\nupper garments, skirts, trousers, anklets, and head-ornaments of\r\nstones considered precious.* The principal material of wearing\r\napparel was cloth woven from threads of hemp and mulberry bark.\r\nAccording to the annals, the arts of spinning, weaving, and dyeing\r\nwere known and practised from the earliest age. The Sun goddess\r\nherself is depicted as seated in the hall of the sacred loom, reeling\r\nsilk from cocoons held in her mouth, and at the ceremony of enticing\r\nher from her retirement, the weaving of blue-and-white stuffs\r\nconstituted an important adjunct. Terms are used (akarurtae and\r\nteru-tae) which show that colour and lustre were esteemed as much as\r\nquality. Ara-tae and nigi-tae were the names used to designate coarse\r\nand fine cloth respectively; striped stuff was called shidori, and\r\nthe name of a princess, Taku-hata-chiji, goes to show that corrugated\r\ncloth was woven from the bark of the taku. Silken fabrics were\r\nmanufactured, but the device of boiling the cocoons had not yet been\r\ninvented. They were held in the mouth for spinning purposes, and the\r\nthreads thus obtained being coarse and uneven, the loom could not\r\nproduce good results. Silk stuffs therefore did not find much favour:\r\nthey were employed chiefly for making cushions, cloth woven from\r\ncotton, hemp, or mulberry bark being preferred for raiment. Pure\r\nwhite was the favourite colour; red, blue, and black being placed in\r\na lower rank in that order. It has been conjectured that furs and\r\nskins were worn, but there is no explicit mention of anything of the\r\nkind. It would seem that their use was limited to making rugs and\r\ncovering utensils.** Sewing is not explicitly referred to, but the\r\nneedle is; and in spite of an assertion to the contrary made by the\r\nChinese author of the Shan-hai-ching (written in the fourth century\r\nA.D.) there is no valid reason to doubt that the process of sewing\r\nwas familiar.\r\n\r\n*B. H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n**In China the case was different. There, garments made of skins or\r\ncovered with feathers were worn in remote antiquity before the art of\r\nweaving had become known. The Records recount that in the age of the\r\nKami \"there came\" (to Japan) \"riding on the crest of the waves, a\r\nkami dressed in skins of geese,\" and this passage has been quoted as\r\nshowing that skins were used for garments in Japan. But it is pointed\r\nout by Japanese commentators that this Kami Sukuna-bikona is\r\nexplicitly stated to have come from a foreign country, and that if\r\nthe passage warrants any inference, it is that the visitor's place of\r\ndeparture had been China.\r\n\r\nAs to the form of the garments worn, the principal were the hakama\r\nand the koromo. The hakama was a species of divided skirt, used by\r\nmen and women alike. It has preserved its shape from age to age, and\r\nis to-day worn by school-girls throughout Japan. The koromo was a\r\ntunic having tight sleeves reaching nearly to the knees. It was\r\nfolded across the breast from right to left and secured by a belt of\r\ncloth or silk tied round the loins. Veils also were used by both\r\nsexes, one kind (the katsugi) having been voluminous enough to cover\r\nthe whole body. \"Combs are mentioned, and it is evident that much\r\nattention was devoted to the dressing of the hair.\"* Men divided\r\ntheirs in the middle and bound it up in two bunches, one over each\r\near. Youths tied theirs into a top-knot; girls wore their locks\r\nhanging down the back but bound together at the neck, and married\r\nladies \"dressed theirs after a fashion which apparently combined the\r\nlast two methods.\" Decoration of the head was carried far on\r\nceremonial occasions, gems, veils, and even coronets being used for\r\nthe purpose. \"There is no mention in any of the old books of cutting\r\nthe hair or beard except in token of disgrace; neither do we gather\r\nthat the sexes, but for this matter of head-dress, were distinguished\r\nby a diversity of apparel or ornamentation.\"*\r\n\r\n*B. H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nFOOD AND DRINK\r\n\r\nRice was the great staple of diet in ancient, as it is in modern,\r\ntimes. The importance attaching to it is shown by the fact that the\r\nSun goddess herself is represented as engaging in its cultivation and\r\nthat injuring a rice-field was among the greatest offences. Barley,\r\nmillet, wheat, and beans are mentioned, but the evidence that they\r\nwere grown largely in remote antiquity is not conclusive. The flesh\r\nof animals and birds was eaten, venison and wild boar being\r\nparticularly esteemed. Indeed, so extensively was the hunting of deer\r\npractised that bows and arrows were often called kago-yumi and\r\nkago-ya (kago signifies \"deer\"). Fish, however, constituted a much\r\nmore important staple of diet than flesh, and fishing in the\r\nabundantly stocked seas that surround the Japanese islands was\r\nlargely engaged in. Horses and cattle were not killed for food. It is\r\nrecorded in the Kogo-shui that the butchering of oxen to furnish meat\r\nfor workers in a rice-field roused the resentment of a Kami called\r\nMitoshi. There does not appear to have been any religious or\r\nsuperstitious scruple connected with this abstention: the animals\r\nwere spared simply because of their usefulness. Vegetables occupied a\r\nlarge space in the list of articles of food. There were the radish,\r\nthe cabbage, the lotus, the melon, and the wild garlic, as well as as\r\nseveral kinds of seaweed. Salt was used for seasoning, the process of\r\nits manufacture having been familiar from the earliest times. Only\r\none kind of intoxicating liquor was ever known in Japan until the\r\nopening of intercourse with the Occident. It was a kind of beer\r\nbrewed* from rice and called sake. The process is said to have been\r\ntaught by Sukuna, who, as shown above, came to Japan from a foreign\r\ncountry--probably China--when the Kami, Okuni-nushi, was establishing\r\norder in the Japanese islands.\r\n\r\n*The term for \"brew\" being kamu or kamosu, the former of which is\r\nhomonymous with the equivalent for \"to chew,\" some commentators have\r\nsupposed that sake was manufactured in early times by grinding rice\r\nwith the teeth. This is at once disproved by the term for \"yeast,\"\r\nnamely, kabi-tachi (fermenting).\r\n\r\nCOOKING AND TABLE EQUIPAGE\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial there were among the officials at the Imperial\r\nCourt men called kashiwa-de, or oak-leaf hands. They had charge of\r\nthe food and drink, and their appellation was derived from the fact\r\nthat rice and other edibles were usually served on oak leaves.\r\nEarthenware utensils were used, but their surface, not being glazed,\r\nwas not allowed to come into direct contact with the viands placed on\r\nthem. In this practice another example is seen of the love of\r\ncleanliness that has always characterized and distinguished the\r\nJapanese nation. Edibles having been thus served, the vessels\r\ncontaining them were ranged on a table, one for each person, and\r\nchop-sticks were used. Everything was cooked, with the exception of\r\ncertain vegetables and a few varieties of fish. Friction of wood upon\r\nwood provided fire, a fact attested by the name of the tree chiefly\r\nused for the purpose, hi-no-ki, or fire-tree. To this day the same\r\nmethod of obtaining a spark is practised at the principal religious\r\nceremonials. Striking metal upon stone was another device for the\r\nsame purpose, and there is no record in Japan, as there is in China,\r\nof any age when food was not cooked. Various vessels of unglazed\r\npottery are mentioned in the Records, as bowls, plates, jars,\r\nand wine-holders, the last being often made of metal. These\r\nwere all included in the term suemono, which may be translated\r\n\"table-utensils.\"\r\n\r\nARMS, ARMOUR, AND GEMS\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that archaeological research shows the\r\nYamato race to have been in possession of iron swords and spears, as\r\nwell as metal armour and shields, from a very early period, probably\r\nthe date of these colonists' first coming to Japan. They also used\r\nsaddles, stirrups, bridles, and bits for horses, so that a Yamato\r\nwarrior in full mail and with complete equipment was perhaps as\r\nformidable a fighting man as any contemporary nation could produce.\r\nBows and arrows were also in use. The latter, tipped with iron or\r\nstone and feathered, were carried in a quiver. The swords employed by\r\nmen were originally double-edged. Their names* show that they were\r\nused alike for cutting and thrusting, and that they varied in length\r\nfrom ten \"hands\" to five. There was also a small single-edged sword**\r\ncarried by women and fastened inside the robe. The value attached to\r\nthe sword is attested by numerous appellations given to blades of\r\nspecial quality. In later times the two-edged sword virtually fell\r\nout of use, being replaced by the single-edged.\r\n\r\n*Tsurugi (to pierce) and tachi (to cut).\r\n\r\n**This was originally called himo-kala-ha, which literally means\r\n\"cord single edge.\" subsequently kala-ha became katana, by which term\r\nall Japanese swords are now known.\r\n\r\nSometimes a spear was decorated with gems. It is curious that gems\r\nshould have been profusely used for personal adornment in ancient\r\ntimes by people who subsequently eschewed the custom well-nigh\r\naltogether, as the Japanese did. The subject has already been\r\nreferred to in the archaeological section, but it may be added here\r\nthat there were guilds of gem-makers (Tama-tsukuri-be) in several\r\nprovinces, and that, apart from imported minerals, the materials with\r\nwhich they worked were coral, quartz, amber, gold, silver, and\r\ncertain pebbles found in Izumo.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nIt appears that when the Yamato immigrants reached Japan, the coast\r\nlands were overgrown with reeds and the greater part of the island\r\nwas covered with primeval forests. Fabulous accounts are given of\r\nmonster trees. Thus, in the Tsukushi Fudoki we read of an oak in\r\nChikugo which towered to a height of 9700 feet, its branches shading\r\nthe peaks of Hizen in the morning and the mountains of Higo in the\r\nevening. The Konjaku Monogatari tells of another oak with a stem\r\nmeasuring 3000 feet in circumference and casting its shadow over\r\nTamba at dawn and on Ise at sunset. In the Fudoki of other provinces\r\nreference is made to forest giants in Harima, Bungo, Hitachi, etc.,\r\nand when full allowance has been made for the exaggerations of\r\ntradition, there remains enough to indicate that the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants did not attempt any work of reclamation.\r\n\r\nOver regions measuring scores of miles perpetual darkness reigned,\r\nand large districts were often submerged by the overflow of rivers.\r\nThere is no mention, however, of a deluge, and Professor Chamberlain\r\nhas called attention to the remarkable fact that a so-called \"Altaic\r\nmyth\" finds no place in the traditions of \"the oldest of the\r\nundoubtedly Altaic nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe annals are eloquent in their accounts of the peopling of the\r\nforests by wild and fierce animals and the infesting of the vallies\r\nby noxious reptiles. The Nihongi, several of the Fudoki, the Konjaku\r\nMonogatari, etc., speak of an eight-headed snake in Izumo, of a\r\nhorned serpent in Hitachi, and of big snakes in Yamato, Mimasaka,\r\nBungo, and other provinces; while the Nihon Bummei Shiryaku tells of\r\nwolves, bears, monkeys, monster centipedes, whales, etc., in Harima,\r\nHida, Izumo, Oki, Tajima, and Kaga. In some cases these gigantic\r\nserpents were probably bandit chiefs transfigured into reptiles by\r\ntradition, but of the broad fact that the country was, for the most\r\npart, in a state of natural wilderness there can be little doubt.\r\n\r\nUnder the sway of the Yamato, however, a great change was gradually\r\neffected. Frequent allusions are made to the encouragement of\r\nagriculture and even its direct pursuit by the Kami. The Sun goddess\r\nis represented as having obtained seeds of the five cereals from the\r\nfemale Kami, Ukemochi,* and as having appointed a village chief to\r\nsuperintend their culture. She had three regions of her own specially\r\ndevoted to rice growing, and her unruly brother, Susanoo, had a\r\nsimilar number, but the latter proved barren. The same goddess\r\ninaugurated sericulture, and entrusted the care of it to a princess,\r\nwho caused mulberry trees to be planted and was able to present silk\r\nfabrics to Amaterasu. In the reign of Jimmu, hemp is said to have\r\nbeen cultivated, and Susanoo, after his reformation, became the\r\nguardian of forests, one of his functions being to fix the uses of\r\nthe various trees, as pine and hinoki (ground-cypress) for house\r\nbuilding, maki (podocarpus Chinensis) for coffin making, and\r\ncamphor-wood for constructing boats. He also planted various kinds of\r\nfruit-trees. Thenceforth successive sovereigns encouraged\r\nagriculture, so that the face of the country was materially changed.\r\n\r\n*The Sun goddess, Amaterasu, and the goddess of Food (Ukemochi no\r\nKami) are the two deities now worshipped at the great shrine of Ise.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of farming implements, however, neither archaeology nor\r\nhistory indicates anything more than iron spades, wooden hoes shod\r\nwith bronze or iron, hand-ploughs, and axes. As to manufacturing\r\nindustries, there were spinners and weavers of cotton and silk,\r\nmakers of kitchen utensils, polishers of gems, workers in gold,\r\nsilver, copper, and iron, forgers of arms and armour, potters of\r\nornamental vessels, and dressers of leather. In later eras the\r\npersons skilled in these various enterprises formed themselves into\r\nguilds (be), each of which carried on its own industry from\r\ngeneration to generation.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there must have been an exchange of goods between these\r\nvarious groups is almost the only indication furnished by the annals\r\nas to trade or commerce. In the name of a daughter of Susa (Princess\r\nKamu-o-ichi) we find a suggestion that markets (ichi) existed, and\r\naccording to the Wei Records (A.D. 211-265) there were, at that time,\r\n\"in each province of Japan markets where the people exchanged their\r\nsuperfluous produce for articles of which they were in need.\" But\r\nJapanese history is silent on this subject.\r\n\r\nAbout the be, however, a great deal is heard. It may be described as\r\na corporated association having for purpose the securing of\r\nefficiency by specialization. Its members seem to have been at the\r\noutset men who independently pursued some branch of industry. These\r\nbeing ultimately formed into a guild, carried on the same pursuit\r\nfrom generation to generation under a chief officially appointed.\r\n\"Potters, makers of stone coffins, of shields, of arrows, of swords,\r\nof mirrors, saddlers, painters, weavers, seamstresses, local\r\nrecorders, scribes, farmers, fleshers, horse-keepers, bird-feeders,\r\nthe mibu who provided wet-nurses for Imperial princes, palace\r\nattendants, and reciters (katari) were organized into be under\r\nspecial chiefs who were probably responsible for their efficient\r\nservices. It would appear, however, that 'chief of be' was sometimes\r\na title bestowed for exceptional service and that it was occasionally\r\nposthumous.\"*\r\n\r\n*Munro.\r\n\r\nBe were also organized for the purpose of commemorating a name quite\r\nirrespective of industrial pursuits. \"The religious be were for\r\ngeneral or special purposes. For instance, there was a be of\r\nsun-worshippers, while the Imibe, a body of abstainers, were obliged\r\nto avoid ritual contamination or impurity. They carried out a\r\ntechnique of spiritual aseptics, both in their persons and through\r\nthe utensils which they employed, much as a modern surgeon guards\r\nagainst infection of his patient. Thus they were prepared to perform\r\nsacred functions.\"*\r\n\r\n*Munro.\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION AND FISHING\r\n\r\nNo information is obtainable as to the nature of the boats used in\r\nvery early times, but it may reasonably be inferred that the Yamato\r\nand other immigrant races possessed craft of some capacity. Several\r\nnames of boats are incidentally mentioned. They evidently refer to\r\nthe speed of the craft--as bird-boat (tori-fune), pigeon-boat\r\n(hato-fune)--or to the material employed, as \"rock-camphor boat\"\r\n(iwa-kusu-bune). \"The presence of neolithic remains on the islands\r\naround Japan proves that the boats of the primitive people were large\r\nenough to traverse fifty miles, or more, of open sea.\"* Only one\r\ndistinct reference to sailing occurs, however, in the ancient annals.\r\nOn the occasion of the alleged expedition to Korea (A.D. 200) under\r\nthe Empress Jingo, the Chronicles say, \"Sail was set from the harbour\r\nof Wani.\" At a date nearly three centuries earlier, there appears to\r\nhave been a marked deficiency of coasting vessels, for the Chronicles\r\nquote an Imperial decree issued B.C. 81, which says: \"Ships are of\r\ncardinal importance to the Empire. At present the people of the\r\ncoast, not having ships, suffer grievously by land transport.\r\nTherefore let every province be caused to have ships built;\"* and it\r\nis related that, a few months later, the building of ships was begun.\r\nAgain, in A.D. 274, a vessel (the Karano) one hundred feet in length,\r\nwas constructed in the province of Izu, and twenty-six years later,\r\naccording to the Chronicles, the Emperor issued this order: \"The\r\nGovernment ship named Karano was sent as tribute by the Lord of Izu.\r\nIt is rotten and unfit for use. It has, however, been in the\r\nGovernment use for a long time, and its services should not be\r\nforgotten. Shall we not keep the name of that ship from being lost\r\nand hand it down to after ages?\" The Karano was then broken and her\r\ntimbers being employed as firewood for roasting salt, the latter was\r\ngiven to the various provinces, which, in return, were caused to\r\nbuild ships for the State, the result being a fleet of five hundred\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n*Aston's Nihongi.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there was always an abundance of fishing-boats,\r\nfor fishing by traps, hooks, and nets was industriously carried on. A\r\npassage in the Records speaks of a thousand-fathom rope of\r\npaper-mulberry which was used to draw the net in perch fishing.\r\nSpearing was also practised by fishermen, and in the rivers\r\ncormorants were used just as they are to-day.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the marriage tie possessed any grave\r\nsignificance in ancient Japan, or that any wedding ceremony was\r\nperformed; unless, indeed, the three circuits made by Izanagi and\r\nIzanami prior to cohabitation round a \"heavenly august pillar\" be\r\ninterpreted as the circumambulatory rite observed in certain\r\nprimitive societies. Pouring water over a bride seems, however, to\r\nhave been practised and is still customary in some provinces, though\r\nas to its antiquity nothing can be said. An exchange of presents is\r\nthe only fact made clear by the annals. There did not exist in Japan,\r\nas in China, a veto on marriages between people of the same tribe,\r\nbut this difference does not signify any reproach to Japan: the\r\ninterdict was purely political in China's case, and corresponding\r\nconditions did not exist in Japan.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Japanese system permitted a degree of licence\r\nwhich in the Occident is called incest: brothers and sisters might\r\nintermarry provided that they had not been brought up together. To\r\nunderstand this condition it is necessary to observe that a bride\r\ngenerally continued to live in her family dwelling where she received\r\nher husband's visits, and since there was nothing to prevent a\r\nhusband from contracting many such alliances, it was possible for him\r\nto have several groups of children, the members of each group being\r\naltogether unknown to the members of all the rest. In a later, but\r\nnot definitely ascertained era, it became customary for a husband to\r\ntake his wife to his own home, and thereafter the veto upon such\r\nunions soon became imperative, so that a Prince Imperial in the fifth\r\ncentury who cohabited with his sister forfeited the succession and\r\nhad to commit suicide, his conduct being described in the Chronicles\r\nas \"a barbarous outrage.\"\r\n\r\nIn all eras sisters might marry the same man, and polygamy was\r\ncommon. A Chinese book, compiled in the early years of the Christian\r\nepoch, speaks of women being so numerous in Japan that nobles had\r\nfour or five wives and commoners two or three. Of course, the reason\r\nassigned for this custom is incorrect: not plenitude of females but\r\ndesire of abundant progeny was primarily the cause. It is notable\r\nthat although the line between nobles and commoners was strictly\r\ndrawn and rigidly observed, it did not extend to marriage in one\r\nsense: a nobleman could always take a wife or a concubine from the\r\nfamily of an inferior. In fact, orders were commonly issued to this\r\nor that province to furnish so many ladies-in-waiting (uneme)--a term\r\nhaving deeper significance than it suggests--and several instances\r\nare recorded of sovereigns summoning to court girls famed for beauty.\r\nThat no distinction was made between wives and concubines has been\r\nalleged, but is not confirmed by the annals. Differentiation by rank\r\nappears to have been always practised, and the offspring was\r\ncertainly thus distinguished.\r\n\r\nBIRTH AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\nA child in ancient Japan was born under considerable difficulties:\r\nits mother had to segregate herself in a parturition hut (ubuya),\r\nwhence even light was excluded and where she was cut off from all\r\nattendance. This strange custom was an outcome of the Shinto canon of\r\npurity. Soon after birth, a child received from its mother a name\r\ngenerally containing some appropriate personal reference. In the\r\nmost ancient times each person (so far as we can judge) bore one\r\nname, or rather one string of words compounded together into a sort\r\nof personal designation. But already at the dawn of the historical\r\nepoch we are met by the mention of surnames and of \"gentile names\r\nbestowed by the sovereign as a recompense for some noteworthy deed.\"*\r\nThese names constantly occur. The principal of them are suzerain\r\n(atae), departmental suzerain (agata-no-atae), departmental lord\r\n(agata-no-nushi), Court noble (ason), territorial lord (inaki), lord\r\n(iratsuko), lady (iratsume), duke (kimi), ruler (miyatsuko), chief\r\n(muraji), grandee (omi), noble (sukune), and lord (wake). In the case\r\nof the Emperors there are also canonical names, which were applied at\r\na comparatively late date in imitation of Chinese usages, and which\r\nmay be said to have completely replaced the names borne during life.\r\nThus, the Emperor known to posterity as Jimmu was called Iware in\r\nlife, the Emperor named Homuda while he sat on the throne is now\r\ndesignated Ojin, and the Emperor who ruled as Osazaki is remembered\r\nas Nintoku. In the Imperial family, and doubtless in the households\r\nof the nobility, wet-nurses were employed, if necessary, as also were\r\nbathing-women, washing-women, and rice-chewers.**\r\n\r\n*B.H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n**\"Rice, which is mainly carbohydrate, is transformed into grape-sugar\r\nby the action of the saliva. This practice is still common in China\r\nand used to be so in Japan where it is now rarely met with. It was\r\nemployed only until dentition was complete.\" (Munro.)\r\n\r\n\"To what we should call education, whether mental or physical, there\r\nis absolutely no reference made in the histories. All that can be\r\ninferred is that, when old enough to do so; the boys began to follow\r\none of the callings of hunter or fisherman, while the girls stayed at\r\nhome weaving the garments of the family. There was a great deal of\r\nfighting, generally of a treacherous kind, in the intervals of which\r\nthe warriors occupied themselves in cultivating patches of ground.\"*\r\n\r\n*B.H. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nBURIAL OF THE DEAD\r\n\r\nBurial rites were important ceremonials. The house hitherto tenanted\r\nby the deceased was abandoned--a custom exemplified in the removal of\r\nthe capital to a new site at the commencement of each reign--and the\r\nbody was transferred to a specially erected mourning-hut draped\r\ninside with fine, white cloth. The relatives and friends then\r\nassembled, and for several days performed a ceremony which resembled\r\nan Irish wake, food and sake being offered to the spirit of the dead,\r\nprayers put up, and the intervals devoted to weird singing and solemn\r\ndancing. Wooden coffins appear to have been used until the beginning\r\nof the Christian era, when stone is said to have come into vogue.\r\n\r\nAt the obsequies of nobles there was considerable organization. Men\r\n(mike-hito) were duly told off to take charge of the offerings of\r\nfood and liquor; others (kisari-mochi) were appointed to carry the\r\nviands; others (hahaki-mochi) carried brooms to sweep the cemetery;\r\nthere were females (usu-me) who pounded rice, and females (naki-me)\r\nwho sung dirges interspersed with eulogies of the deceased. The\r\nRecords mention that at the burial of Prince Waka a number of birds\r\nwere used instead of these female threnodists. It appears, further,\r\nthat those following a funeral walked round the coffin waving\r\nblue-and-red banners, carrying lighted torches, and playing music.\r\n\r\nIn the sepulchres the arms, utensils, and ornaments used daily by the\r\ndeceased were interred, and it was customary to bury alive around the\r\ntombs of Imperial personages and great nobles a number of the\r\ndeceased's principal retainers. The latter inhuman habit was\r\nnominally abandoned at the close of the last century before Christ,\r\nimages of baked clay being substituted for human sacrifices, but the\r\nspirit which informed the habit survived, and even down to modern\r\ntimes there were instances of men and women committing suicide for\r\nthe purpose of rejoining the deceased beyond the grave. As to the\r\nnature of the tombs raised over the dead, the main facts have been\r\nstated in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nTEETH BLACKENING AND FACE PAINTING\r\n\r\nThe habit of blackening the teeth has long prevailed among married\r\nwomen in Japan, but the Yamato tombs have thus far furnished only one\r\nexample of the practice, and no mention occurs in the ancient annals.\r\nFace painting, however, would seem to have been indulged in by both\r\nsexes. Several of the pottery images (haniwa) taken from the tombs\r\nindicate that red pigment was freely and invariably used for that\r\npurpose. It was applied in broad streaks or large patches, the former\r\nencircling the face or forming bands across it; the latter, covering\r\nthe eyes or triangulating the cheeks. It is probable that this\r\nbizarre decoration was used only on ceremonial occasions and that it\r\nappears in a greatly accentuated form on the haniwa.\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\nAs to amusements in prehistoric times little information is\r\nfurnished. Hunting the boar and the stag was the principal pastime,\r\nand hawking is described as having been practised in the fourth\r\ncentury of the Christian era. Music and dancing seem to have been in\r\nvogue from time immemorial, but there is nothing to tell what kind of\r\nmusical instruments were in the hands of the early Yamato. The koto,\r\na kind of horizontal lute, and the flute are spoken of in the\r\nChronicles, but the date of their introduction is not indicated.\r\nWrestling, cockfighting (with metal spurs), picnics, a kind of\r\ndrafts, gambling with dice, and football are all referred to, and\r\nwere probably indulged in from a very early date.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery existed among the Yamato. It will be\r\npresently spoken of.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that in the prehistoric age a high position\r\nwas accorded to women and that their rights received large\r\nrecognition. The facts that the first place in the Japanese pantheon\r\nwas assigned to a goddess; that the throne was frequently occupied by\r\nEmpresses; that females were chiefs of tribes and led armies on\r\ncampaign; that jealous wives turned their backs upon faithless\r\nhusbands; that mothers chose names for their children and often had\r\ncomplete charge of their upbringing--all these things go to show that\r\nthe self-effacing rank taken by Japanese women in later ages was a\r\nradical departure from the original canon of society. It is not to be\r\ninferred, however, that fidelity to the nuptial tie imposed any check\r\non extra-marital relations in the case of men: it had no such effect.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"IKEBANA\" FLOWER ARRANGEMENT\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ENTRANCE TO THE TOMB OF THE EMPEROR JIMMU IN UNEBI-YAMA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PREHISTORIC SOVEREIGNS\r\n\r\nJIMMU\r\n\r\nIT is held by eminent Japanese historians that the Emperor Jimmu,\r\nwhen he set out for Yamato, did not contemplate an armed campaign but\r\nmerely intended to change his capital from the extreme south to the\r\ncentre of the country. This theory is based on the words of the\r\naddress he made to his elder brothers and his sons when inviting them\r\nto accompany him on the expedition \"Why should we not proceed to\r\nYamato and make it the capital?\"--and on the fact that, on arriving\r\nin the Kibi district, namely, the region now divided into the three\r\nprovinces of Bizen, Bitchu, and Bingo, he made a stay of three years\r\nfor the purpose of amassing an army and provisioning it, the\r\nperception that he would have to fight having been realized for the\r\nfirst time. Subsequently he encountered strongest resistance at the\r\nhands of Prince Nagasune, whose title of Hiko (Child of the Sun)\r\nshowed that he belonged to the Yamato race, and who exercised\r\nmilitary control under the authority of Nigihayahi, elder brother of\r\nJimmu's father. This Nigihayahi had been despatched from the\r\ncontinental realm of the Yamato--wherever that may have been--at a\r\ndate prior to the despatch of his younger brother, Ninigi, for the\r\npurpose of subjugating the \"land of fair rice-ears and fertile reed\r\nplains,\" but of the incidents of his expedition history takes no\r\nnotice: it merely shows him as ruling in Yamato at the time of\r\nJimmu's arrival there, and describes how Nigihayahi, having been\r\nconvinced by a comparison of weapons of war that Jimmu was of his own\r\nlineage, surrendered the authority to him and caused, Prince Nagasune\r\nto be put to death.\r\n\r\nFrom a chronological point of view it is difficult to imagine the\r\nco-existence of Jimmu and his great-granduncle, but the story may\r\nperhaps be accepted in so far as it confirms the tradition that, in\r\nprosecuting his Yamato campaign, Jimmu received the submission of\r\nseveral chieftains (Kami) belonging to the same race as himself.\r\nReference to these facts is essential to an understanding of the\r\nclass distinctions found in the Japanese social system. All the\r\nchieftains who led the expedition from Kyushu were subsequently\r\ndesignated Tenshin--a term which may be conveniently rendered \"Kami\r\nof the descent\"--and all those who, like Nigihayahi, had previously\r\nbeen in occupation of the country, were styled kum-tsu-Kami,\r\nor \"territorial Kami.\" Another method of distinguishing was\r\nto include the former in the Kwobetsu and the latter in the\r\nShimbetsu--distinctions which will be more fully explained\r\nhereafter--and after apotheosis the members of these two classes\r\nbecame respectively \"deities of heaven\" and \"deities of earth,\" a\r\ndistinction possessing historical rather than qualificatory force.\r\n\r\nAs for subdivisions, the head of a Kwobetsu family had the title of\r\nomi (grandee) and the head of a Shimbetsu family that of muraji\r\n(chief). Thus, the organization of the State depended primarily on\r\nthe principle of ancestor worship. The sceptre descended by divine\r\nright without any regard to its holder's competence, while the\r\nadministrative posts were filled by men of the same race with a\r\nsimilar hereditary title. Aliens like the Yezo, the Tsuchi-gumo, and\r\nthe Kumaso were either exterminated or made slaves (nuhi).\r\n\r\nTHE TERM \"YAMATO\"\r\n\r\nAs to the term \"Yamato,\" it appears that, in the earliest times, the\r\nwhole country now called Japan was known as Yamato, and that\r\nsubsequently the designation became restricted to the province which\r\nbecame the seat of government. The Chinese, when they first took\r\ncognizance of the islands lying on their east, seem to have applied\r\nthe name Wado--pronounced \"Yamato\" by the Japanese--to the tribes\r\ninhabiting the western shores of Japan, namely, the Kumaso or the\r\nTsuchi-gumo, and in writing the word they used ideographs conveying a\r\nsense of contempt. The Japanese, not unnaturally, changed these\r\nideographs to others having the same sounds but signifying \"great\r\npeace.\" At a later time the Chinese or the Koreans began to designate\r\nthese eastern islands, Jih-pen, or \"Sunrise Island,\" a term which, in\r\nthe fifteenth century, was perverted by the Dutch into Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST NINE EMPERORS\r\n\r\nIn attempting to construct coherent annals out of the somewhat\r\nfragmentary Japanese histories of remote ages, the student is\r\nimmediately confronted by chronological difficulties. Apart from the\r\nbroad fact that the average age of the first seventeen Emperors from\r\nJimmu downwards is 109 years, while the average age of the next\r\nseventeen is only sixty-one and a half years, there are\r\nirreconcilable discrepancies in some of the dates themselves. Thus,\r\naccording to the Records, the eighth Emperor, Kogen, died at\r\nfifty-seven, but according to the Chronicles he ascended the throne\r\nat fifty-nine and reigned fifty-six years. Again, whereas the ninth\r\nsovereign, Kaikwa, is by the Records given a life of only sixty-three\r\nyears, the Chronicles make him assume the sceptre at fifty-one and\r\nwield it for fifty-nine years. Such conflicts of evidence are fatal\r\nto confidence. Nor do they disappear wholly until the beginning of\r\nthe fifth century, at which time, moreover, the incidents of Japanese\r\nhistory receive their first confirmation from the history of China\r\nand Korea.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not extravagant to conclude that the first ten and a\r\nhalf centuries covered by Japanese annals must be regarded as\r\nprehistoric. On the other hand, the incidents attributed to this long\r\ninterval are not by any means of such a nature as to suggest\r\ndeliberate fabrication. An annalist who was also a courtier, applying\r\nhimself to construct the story of his sovereign's ancestors, would\r\nnaturally be disposed to embellish his pages with narratives of great\r\nexploits and brilliant achievements. Neither the Records nor the\r\nChronicles can be said to display such a propensity in any marked\r\ndegree. The Chronicles do, indeed, draw upon the resources of Chinese\r\nhistory to construct ethical codes and scholarly diction for their\r\nImperial figures, but the Records show no traces of adventitious\r\ncolour nor make an attempt to minimize the evil and magnify the good.\r\n\r\nThus, while it is evident that to consolidate Jimmu's conquest and to\r\nestablish order among the heterogeneous elements of his empire he\r\nmust have been followed by rulers of character and prowess, the\r\nannals show nothing of the kind. On the contrary, the reigns of his\r\neight immediate successors are barren of all striking incident. The\r\nclosing chapter of Jimmu himself is devoted chiefly to his amours,\r\nand the opening page in the life of his immediate successor, Suisei,\r\nshows that the latter reached the throne by assassinating his elder\r\nbrother. For the rest, the annals of the eight sovereigns who reigned\r\nduring the interval between 561 and 98 B.C. recount mainly the\r\npolygamous habits of these rulers and give long genealogies of the\r\nnoble families founded by their offspring--a dearth of romance which\r\nbears strong witness to the self-restraint of the compilers. We learn\r\nincidentally that on his accession each sovereign changed the site of\r\nhis palace, seldom passing, however, beyond the limits of the\r\nprovince of Yamato, and we learn, also, that the principle of\r\nprimogeniture, though generally observed, was often violated.\r\n\r\nHSU FUH\r\n\r\nA Japanese tradition assigns to the seventy-second year of the reign\r\nof Korei the advent of a Chinese Taoist, by name Hsu Fuh. Korei,\r\nseventh in descent from Jimmu, held the sceptre from 290 to 215 B.C.,\r\nand the seventy-second year of his reign fell, therefore, in 219 B.C.\r\nNow, to the east of the town of Shingu in Kii province, at a place on\r\nthe seashore in the vicinity of the site of an ancient castle, there\r\nstands a tomb bearing the inscription \"Grave of Hsu Fuh from China,\"\r\nand near it are seven tumuli said to be the burial-places of Hsu's\r\ncompanions. Chinese history states that Hsu Fuh was a learned man who\r\nserved the first Emperor of the Chin dynasty (255-206 B.C.), and that\r\nhe obtained his sovereign's permission to sail to the islands of the\r\neast in search of the elixir of life. Setting out from Yentai (the\r\npresent Chefoo) in his native province of Shantung, Hsu landed at\r\nKumano in the Kii promontory, and failing to find the elixir,\r\npreferred to pass his life in Japan rather than to return\r\nunsuccessful to the Court of the tyranical Chin sovereign, burner of\r\nthe books and builder of the Great Wall. A poem composed in the Sung\r\ndynasty (A.D. 960-1280) says that when Hsu Fuh set out, the books had\r\nnot been burned, and that a hundred volumes thus survived in his\r\nkeeping. Of course, the date assigned by Japanese tradition to the\r\ncoming of Hsu may have been adapted to Chinese history, and it\r\ntherefore furnishes no evidence as to the accuracy of the Chronicles'\r\nchronology. But the existence of the tomb may be regarded as proving\r\nthat some communication took place between China and Japan at that\r\nremote epoch.*\r\n\r\n*The route taken by Hsu Fuh namely, from Chefoo down the China Sea\r\nand round the south of Japan is difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH EMPEROR, SUJIN\r\n\r\nThe reign of this sovereign (97-30 B.C.) is the first eventful period\r\nsince the death of Jimmu. It is memorable for the reorganization of\r\nreligious rites; for the extension of the effective sway of the\r\nThrone, and for the encouragement of agriculture. When the first\r\nEmperor installed the sacred insignia in the palace where he himself\r\ndwelt, the instinct of filial piety and the principle of ancestor\r\nworship were scarcely distinguishable. But as time passed and as the\r\nage of the Kami became more remote, a feeling of awe began to pervade\r\nthe rites more strongly than a sense of family affection, and the\r\nidea of residing and worshipping in the same place assumed a\r\ncharacter of sacrilege. This may have been directly suggested by a\r\npestilence which, decimating the nation, was interpreted as implying\r\nthe need of greater purity. A replica of the sacred mirror was\r\nmanufactured, and the grandson of the great worker in metal\r\nMahitotsu, the \"One-eyed\" was ordered to forge an imitation of the\r\nsacred sword. These imitations, together with the sacred jewel, were\r\nkept in the palace, but the originals were transferred to Kasanui in\r\nYamato, where a shrine for the worship of the Sun goddess had been\r\nbuilt. But though the pestilence was stayed, it brought an aftermath\r\nof lawlessness and produced much unrest in the regions remote from\r\nYamato. Sujin therefore organized a great military movement, the\r\ncampaign of the Shido shogun, or \"Generalissimo of the four\r\nCircuits.\"*\r\n\r\n*The term \"do\" indicates a group of provinces.\r\n\r\nThe leaders chosen for this task were all members of the Imperial\r\nfamily--a great-uncle, an uncle, a younger brother, and a first\r\ncousin of the Emperor--and the fields of operation assigned to them\r\nwere: first, to the west along the northern shore of the Inland Sea;\r\nsecondly, to the northwest into Tamba, Tango, and Tajima; thirdly, to\r\nthe north along the sea of Japan, and finally to the east along the\r\nroute now known as the Tokaido. No attempt is made by the writers of\r\neither the Records or the Chronicles to describe the preparations for\r\nthis extensive campaign. Tradition seems to have preserved the bare\r\nfact only.\r\n\r\nOne interesting interlude is described, however. Before the first\r\nbody of troops had passed beyond range of easy communication with\r\nMizugaki in Yamato, where the Court resided, the prince in command\r\nheard a girl singing by the wayside, and the burden of her song\r\nseemed to imply that, while foes at home menaced the capital, foes\r\nabroad should not be attacked. The prince, halting his forces,\r\nreturned to Mizugaki to take counsel, and the Emperor's aunt\r\ninterpreted the song to signify that his Majesty's half-brother,\r\nHaniyasu, who governed the adjacent province of Yamato, was plotting\r\ntreason. Then all the troops having been recalled, preparations to\r\nguard the capital were made, and soon afterwards, news came that\r\nHaniyasu, at the head of an army, was advancing from the direction of\r\nYamashiro, while his wife, Ata, was leading another force from Osaka,\r\nthe plan being to unite the two armies for the attack on Yamato. The\r\nEmperor's generals at once assumed the offensive. They moved first\r\nagainst Princess Ata, killed her and exterminated her forces; after\r\nwhich they dealt similarly with Haniyasu. This chapter of history\r\nillustrates the important part taken by women in affairs of State at\r\nthat epoch, and incidentally confirms the fact that armour was worn\r\nby men in battle.\r\n\r\nThe four Imperial generals were now able to resume their temporarily\r\ninterrupted campaigns. According to the Chronicles they completed the\r\ntasks assigned to them and returned to the capital within six months.\r\nBut such chronology cannot be reconciled with facts. For it is\r\nrelated that the generals sent northward by the western seaboard and\r\nthe eastern seaboard, respectively, came together at Aizu,* one\r\nreaching that place via Hitachi, the other via Echigo. Thus, it would\r\nresult that Yamato armies at that remote epoch marched hundreds of\r\nmiles through country in the face of an enemy within a few months.\r\nFurther, to bring the aboriginal tribes into subjugation, an isolated\r\ncampaign would have been quite inadequate. Some kind of permanent\r\ncontrol was essential, and there is collateral evidence that the\r\ndescendants of the four princely generals, during many generations,\r\noccupied the position of provincial magnates and exercised virtually\r\ndespotic sway within the localities under their jurisdiction. Thus in\r\nthe provinces of Omi, of Suruga, of Mutsu, of Iwashiro, of Iwaki, of\r\nEchigo, of Etchu, of Echizen, of Bizen, of Bitchu, of Bingo, of\r\nHarima, of Tamba, and elsewhere, there are found in later ages noble\r\nfamilies all tracing their descent to one or another of the Shido\r\nshoguns despatched on the task of pacifying the country in the days\r\nof the Emperor Sujin. The genealogies which fill pages of the Records\r\nfrom the days of Jimmu downwards point clearly to the growth of a\r\npowerful feudal aristocracy, for the younger sons born to successive\r\nsovereigns bear, for the most part, names indicative of territorial\r\nlordship; but it seems justifiable to conclude that the first great\r\nimpetus to that kind of decentralization was given by Sujin's\r\ndespatch of the Shido shoguns.\r\n\r\n*Hence the term \"Aizu,\" form, signifies \"to meet.\"\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND TAXATION\r\n\r\nThe digging of reservoirs and tunnels for irrigating rice-fields\r\nreceived unprecedented attention in the reign of this Emperor, and\r\nmention is for the first time made of taxes--tributes of \"bow-notches\r\nand of finger-tips,\" in other words, the produce of the chase and the\r\nproducts of the loom. A census was taken for taxation purposes, but\r\nunhappily the results are nowhere recorded. The Court gave itself\r\nsome concern about maritime transport also. A rescript ordered that\r\nships should be built by every province, but nothing is stated as to\r\ntheir dimensions or nature. In this rescript it is mentioned that\r\n\"the people of the coast not having ships, suffer grievously by land\r\ntransport.\" What they suffered may be inferred from a description in\r\nthe Chronicles where we read that at the building of the tomb of a\r\nprincess, \"the people, standing close to each other, passed the\r\nstones from hand to hand, and thus transported them from Osaka to\r\nYamato.\"\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nKorea, when Japanese history is first explicitly concerned with it,\r\nwas peopled by a number of semi-independent tribes, and the part of\r\nthe peninsula lying southward of the Han River--that is to say,\r\nsouthward of the present Seoul--comprised three kingdoms. Of these\r\nMa-Han occupied the whole of the western half of the peninsula along\r\nthe coast of the Yellow Sea; while Sin-Han and Pyong-Han formed the\r\neastern half, lying along the shore of the Sea of Japan. The three\r\nwere collectively spoken of as Sam-Han (the three Han). But Japan's\r\nrelations with the peninsula did not always involve these major\r\ndivisions. Her annals speak of Shiragi (or Sinra), Kara, Kudara, and\r\nKoma. Shiragi and Kara were principalities carved respectively out of\r\nthe southeast and south of Pyong-Han. Thus, they lay nearest to\r\nJapan, the Korea Strait alone intervening, and the Korea Strait was\r\nalmost bridged by islands. Kudara constituted the modern Seoul and\r\nits vicinity; Koma, (called also Korai and in Korea, Kokuli), the\r\nmodern Pyong-yang and its district. These two places were rendered\r\nspecially accessible by the rivers Han and Tadong which flowed\r\nthrough them to the Yellow Sea; but of course in this respect they\r\ncould not compare with Shiragi (Sinra) and Kara, of which latter\r\nplace the Japanese usually spoke as Mimana.\r\n\r\nThere can scarcely be any doubt that the Korean peninsula was largely\r\npermeated with Chinese influences from a very early date, but the\r\nprocesses which produced that result need not be detailed here. It\r\nhas been also shown above that, in the era prior to Jimmu,\r\nindications are found of intercourse between Japan and Korea, and\r\neven that Susanoo and his son held sway in Shiragi. But the first\r\ndirect reference made by Japanese annals to Korea occurs in the reign\r\nof Sujin, 33 B.C. when an envoy from Kara arrived at the Mizugaki\r\nCourt, praying that a Japanese general might be sent to compose a\r\nquarrel which had long raged between Kara and Shiragi, and to take\r\nthe former under Japan's protection. It appears that this envoy had\r\ntravelled by a very circuitous route. He originally made the port of\r\nAnato (modern Nagato), but Prince Itsutsu, who ruled there, claimed\r\nto be the sole monarch of Japan and refused to allow the envoy to\r\nproceed, so that the latter had to travel north and enter Japan via\r\nKehi-no-ura (now Tsuruga.)\r\n\r\nIncidentally this narrative corroborates a statement made in Chinese\r\nhistory (compiled in the Later Han era, A.D. 25-220) to the effect\r\nthat many Japanese provinces claimed to be under hereditary rulers\r\nwho exercised sovereign rights. Such, doubtless, was the attitude\r\nassumed by several of the Imperial descendants who had obtained\r\nprovincial estates. The Emperor Sujin received the envoy courteously\r\nand seemed disposed to grant his request, but his Majesty's death (30\r\nB.C.) intervened, and not until two years later was the envoy able to\r\nreturn. His mission had proved abortive, but the Emperor Suinin,\r\nSujin's successor, gave him some red-silk fabrics to carry home and\r\nconferred on his country the name Mimana, in memory of Sujin, whose\r\nappellation during life had been Mimaki.\r\n\r\nThese details furnish an index to the relations that existed in that\r\nera between the neighbouring states of the Far East. The special\r\ninterest of the incident lies, however, in the fact that it furnishes\r\nthe first opportunity of comparing Japanese history with Korean. The\r\nlatter has two claims to credence. The first is that it assigns no\r\nincredible ages to the sovereigns whose reigns it records. According\r\nto Japanese annals there were only seven accessions to the throne of\r\nYamato during the first four centuries of the Christian era.\r\nAccording to Korean annals, the three peninsular principalities had\r\nsixteen, seventeen, and sixteen accessions, respectively, in the same\r\ninterval. The second claim is that, during the same four centuries,\r\nthe histories of China and Korea agree in ten dates and differ in two\r\nonly.* On the whole, therefore, Korean annals deserve to be credited.\r\nBut whereas Japanese history represents warfare as existing between\r\nKara and Shiragi in 33 B.C., Korean history represents the conflict\r\nas having broken out in A.D. 77. There is a difference of just 110\r\nyears, and the strong probability of accuracy is on the Korean side.\r\n\r\n*For a masterly analysis of this subject see a paper on Early\r\nJapanese History by Mr. W. G. Aston in Vol. XVI of the \"Translations\r\nof the Asiatic Society of Japan.\"\r\n\r\nTHE ELEVENTH SOVEREIGN, SUININ (29 B.C.--A.D. 70)\r\n\r\nSuinin, second son of his predecessor, obtained the throne by a\r\nprocess which frankly ignored the principle of primogeniture. For\r\nSujin, having an equal affection for his two sons, confessed himself\r\nunable to choose which of them should be his successor and was\r\ntherefore guided by a comparison of their dreams, the result being\r\nthat the younger was declared Prince Imperial, and the elder became\r\nduke of the provinces of Kamitsuke (now Kotsuke) and Shimotsuke.\r\nSuinin, like all the monarchs of that age, had many consorts: nine\r\nare catalogued in the Records and their offspring numbered sixteen,\r\nmany of whom received local titles and had estates conferred in the\r\nprovinces. In fact, this process of ramifying the Imperial family\r\nwent on continuously from reign to reign.\r\n\r\nThere are in the story of this sovereign some very pathetic elements.\r\nPrince Saho, elder brother of the Empress, plotted to usurp the\r\nthrone. Having cajoled his sister into an admission that her brother\r\nwas dearer than her husband, he bade her prove it by killing the\r\nEmperor in his sleep. But when an opportunity offered to perpetrate\r\nthe deed as the sovereign lay sleeping with her knees as pillow, her\r\nheart melted, and her tears, falling on the Emperor's face, disturbed\r\nhis slumber. He sought the cause of her distress, and learning it,\r\nsent a force to seize the rebel. Remorse drove the Empress to die\r\nwith Prince Saho. Carrying her little son, she entered the fort where\r\nher brother with his followers had taken refuge. The Imperial troops\r\nset fire to the fort--which is described as having been built with\r\nrice-bags piled up--and the Empress emerged with the child in her\r\narms; but having thus provided for its safety, she fled again to the\r\nfort and perished with her brother. This terrible scene appears to\r\nhave given the child such a shock that he lost the use of speech, and\r\nthe Records devote large space to describing the means employed for\r\nthe amusement of the child, the long chase and final capture of a\r\nswan whose cry, as it flew overhead, had first moved the youth to\r\nspeech, and the cure ultimately effected by building a shrine for the\r\nworship of the deity of Izumo, who, in a previous age, had been\r\ncompelled to abdicate the sovereignty of the country in favour of a\r\nlater descendant of the Sun goddess, and whose resentment was\r\nthereafter often responsible for calamities overtaking the Court or\r\nthe people of Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE ISE SHRINE AND THE PRACTICE OF JUNSHI\r\n\r\nTwo events specially memorable in this reign were the transfer of the\r\nshrine of the Sun goddess to Ise, where it has remained ever since,\r\nand the abolition of the custom of junshi, or following in death. The\r\nlatter shocking usage, a common rite of animistic religion, was in\r\npart voluntary, in part compulsory. In its latter aspect it came\r\nvividly under the notice of the Emperor Suinin when the tomb of his\r\nyounger brother, Yamato, having been built within earshot of the\r\npalace, the cries of his personal attendants, buried alive around his\r\ngrave, were heard, day and night, until death brought silence. In the\r\nfollowing year (A.D. 3), the Empress having died, a courtier,\r\nNomi-no-Sukune, advised the substitution of clay figures for the\r\nvictims hitherto sacrificed. Nominally, the practice of compulsory\r\njunshi ceased from that date,* but voluntary junshi continued to find\r\noccasional observance until modern times.\r\n\r\n*Of course it is to be remembered that the dates given by Japanese\r\nhistorians prior to the fifth century A.D. are very apocryphal.\r\n\r\nWRESTLING\r\n\r\nThe name of Nomi-no-Sukune is associated with the first mention of\r\nwrestling in Japanese history. By the Chronicles a brief account is\r\ngiven of a match between Nomi and Taema-no-Kuehaya. The latter was\r\nrepresented to be so strong that he could break horns and straighten\r\nhooks. His frequently expressed desire was to find a worthy\r\ncompetitor. Nomi-no-Sukune, summoned from Izumo by the Emperor, met\r\nKuehaya in the lists of the palace of Tamaki and kicked him to death.\r\nWrestling thereafter became a national pastime, but its methods\r\nunderwent radical change, kicking being abolished altogether.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nIt is believed by Japanese historians that during the reign of Suinin\r\na local government station (chinju-fu) was established in Anra\r\nprovince of Mimana, and that this station, subsequently known as\r\nNippon-fu, was transferred to Tsukushi (Kyushu) and named Dazai-fu\r\nwhen Japan's influence in Mimana waned. The first general (shoguri)\r\nof the chinju-fu was Prince Shihotari, and the term kishi--which in\r\nKorea signified headman--was thenceforth incorporated into his family\r\nname. To the members of that family in later generations was\r\nentrusted the conduct of the Empire's foreign affairs. But it does\r\nnot appear that the Imperial Court in Yamato paid much attention to\r\noversea countries in early eras. Intercourse with these was\r\nconducted, for the most part, by the local magnates who held sway in\r\nthe western regions of Japan.\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of Suinin, if Japanese chronology be\r\naccepted, that notices of Japan began to appear in Chinese history--a\r\nhistory which justly claims to be reliable from 145 B.C. Under the\r\nLater Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220), great progress was made in\r\nliterature and art by the people of the Middle Kingdom, and this\r\nprogress naturally extended, not only to Korea, which had been\r\nconquered by the Chinese sovereign, Wu-Ti, in the second century\r\nbefore Christ and was still partly under the rule of Chinese\r\ngovernors, but also to the maritime regions of Japan, whence the\r\nshores of Korea were almost within sight. China in those ages was\r\nincomparably the greatest and most enlightened country in the Orient,\r\nand it had become the custom with adjacent States to send emissaries\r\nto her Court, bearing gifts which she handsomely requited; so that\r\nwhile, from one point of view, the envoys might be regarded as\r\ntribute-carriers, from another, the ceremony presented the character\r\nof a mere interchange of neighbourly civilities. In Japan, again,\r\nadministrative centralization was still imperfect. Some of the local\r\nmagnates had not yet been brought fully under the sway of the Yamato\r\ninvaders, and some, as scions of the Imperial family, arrogated a\r\nconsiderable measure of independence. Thus it resulted that several\r\nof these provincial dukes--or \"kings,\" as not a few of them were\r\ncalled--maintained relations with Korea, and through her despatched\r\ntribute missions to the Chinese Court from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it is not surprising to find the Chinese\r\nhistorians of the first century A.D. writing: \"The Wa (Japanese)\r\ndwell southeast of Han* (Korea) on a mountainous island in midocean.\r\nTheir country is divided into more than one hundred provinces. Since\r\nthe time when Wu-Ti (140-86 B.C.) overthrew Korea, they (the\r\nJapanese) have communicated with the Han (Korean) authorities by\r\nmeans of a postal service. There are thirty-two provinces which do\r\nso, all of which style their rulers 'kings' who are hereditary. The\r\nsovereign of Great Wa resides in Yamato, distant 12,000 li (4000\r\nmiles) from the frontier of the province of Yolang (the modern\r\nPyong-yang in Korea). In the second year of Chung-yuan (A.D. 57), in\r\nthe reign of Kwang-wu, the Ito** country sent an envoy with tribute,\r\nwho styled himself Ta-fu. He came from the most western part of the\r\nWa country. Kwang-wu presented him with a seal and ribbon.\" [Aston's\r\ntranslation.]\r\n\r\n*It is necessary to distinguish carefully between the Han dynasty of\r\nChina and the term \"Han\" as a designation of Korea.\r\n\r\n**The ideographs composing this word were pronounced \"I-to\" at the\r\ntime when they were written by the Hou-Han historians, but they\r\nsubsequently received the sound of \"Wo-nu\" or \"wa-do.\"\r\n\r\nThese passages have provoked much discussion, but Japanese annalists\r\nare for the most part agreed that \"Ito\" should be read \"I-no-na,\"\r\nwhich corresponds with the ancient Na-no-Agata, the present Naka-gori\r\nin Chikuzen, an identification consistent with etymology and\r\nsupported by the fact that, in 1764, a gold seal supposed to be the\r\noriginal of the one mentioned above, was dug out of the ground in\r\nthat region. In short, Na-no-Agata is identical with the ancient\r\nWatazumi-no-Kuni, which was one of the countries of Japan's\r\nintercourse. Further, the Yamato of the Hou-Han historians is not to\r\nbe regarded as the province of that name in central Japan, but as one\r\nof the western districts, whether Yamato in Higo, or Yamato in\r\nChikugo. It has been shrewdly suggested* that the example of Korea\r\nhad much influence in inducing the local rulers in the western and\r\nsouthern provinces to obtain the Chinese Court's recognition of their\r\nadministrative status, but, whatever may have been the dominant\r\nmotive, it seems certain that frequent intercourse took place between\r\nJapan and China via Korea immediately before and after the beginning\r\nof the Christian era. Again, that Koreans came freely to Japan and\r\nsettled there is attested by the case of a son of the King of Shiragi\r\nwho, coming to the Tajima region, took a Japanese wife and\r\nestablished himself there, founding a distinguished family. The\r\nclosing episode of the Emperor Suinin's life was the despatch of\r\nTajima Mori, this immigrant's descendant, to the country of Tokoyo,\r\nnominally for the purpose of obtaining orange-seeds, but probably\r\nwith the ulterior motive of exploration.\r\n\r\n*By Dr. Ariga, an eminent Japanese authority.\r\n\r\nThe reader is already familiar with this Tokoyo-no-Kuni (Eternal\r\nLand). We hear of it first as the home of \"long-singing birds\"\r\nsummoned to take part in enticing the Sun goddess from her cave. Then\r\nit figures as the final retreat of Sukuna-hikona, the Aescalapius of\r\nthe mythological age. Then we find one of Jimmu's elder brothers\r\ntreading on the waves to reach it. Then we hear of it as the\r\nbirthplace of the billows that make Ise their bourne, and now it is\r\ndescribed by Tajima Mori in his death-song as the \"mysterious realm\r\nof gods and genii,\" so distant that ten years were needed to reach it\r\nand return. It appears in fact to have been an epithet for China in\r\ngeneral, and the destination of Tajima Mori is believed to have been\r\nShantung, to reach which place by sea from Japan was a great feat of\r\nnavigation in those primitive days. Tajima Mori returned to find the\r\nEmperor dead, and in despair he committed suicide.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe reclamation of land for purposes of rice cultivation went on\r\nvigorously during Suinin's reign. More than eight hundred ponds and\r\naqueducts are said to have been constructed by order of the sovereign\r\nfor irrigation uses throughout the provinces. It would seem, too,\r\nthat the practice of formally consulting Court officials about\r\nadministrative problems had its origin at this time. No definite\r\norganization for the purpose was yet created, but it became customary\r\nto convene distinguished scions of the Imperial line and heads of\r\ngreat subject-families to discuss and report upon affairs of State.\r\nAnother innovation referred to in this era was the offering of\r\nweapons of war at the shrines. We read of as many as a thousand\r\nswords being forged to form part of the sacred treasures at the\r\nshrine of Ise-no-Kami, and the occasion was seized to organize a\r\nnumber of hereditary corporations (be) of arm-makers and armourers.\r\nThese were placed under the control of Prince Inishiki, another of\r\nthe captains of the Imperial life-guards (mononobe-no-Obito). It is\r\nthus evident that something more than a religious rite was involved\r\nin these measures.\r\n\r\nTHE TWELFTH EMPEROR, KEIKO (A.D. 71--130)\r\n\r\nAccording to the Records, Keiko was ten feet two inches high, and his\r\nshank measured four feet one inch. His nomination as Prince Imperial\r\nwas an even more arbitrary violation of the right of primogeniture\r\nthan the case of his predecessor had been, for he was chosen in\r\npreference to his elder brother merely because, when the two youths\r\nwere casually questioned as to what they wished for, the elder said,\r\n\"a bow and arrows,\" and the younger, \"the empire.\" The delusive\r\nnature of the Nihongi's chronology in these prehistoric epochs is\r\nexemplified in the annals of this sovereign, for he is represented as\r\nhaving been in his eighty-third year when he ascended the throne,\r\nyet, in the third year of his reign, he took a consort who bore him\r\nthirteen children, and altogether his progeny numbered eighty sons\r\nand daughters by seven wives. His plan of providing for these\r\nnumerous scions constituted the first systematization of a custom\r\nwhich had been observed in a fitful manner by several of his\r\npredecessors. They had given to their sons local titles and estates\r\nbut had not required them to leave the capital. Keiko, however,\r\nappointed his sons, with three exceptions, to the position of\r\nprovincial or district viceroy, preserving their Imperial connexion\r\nby calling them wake, or branch families. This subject will present\r\nitself for further notice during the reign of Keiko's successor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most memorable events in this epoch was the Emperor's\r\nmilitary expedition in person to quell the rebellious Kumaso (q.v.)\r\nin Kyushu. There had not been any instance of the sovereign taking\r\nthe field in person since Jimmu's time, and the importance attaching\r\nto the insurrection is thus shown. Allowance has to be made, however,\r\nfor the fact that the territory held by these Kumaso in the south of\r\nKyushu was protected by a natural rampart of stupendous mountain\r\nranges which rendered military access arduous, and which, in after\r\nages, enabled a great feudatory to defy the Central Government for\r\ncenturies. In connexion with this expedition a noteworthy fact is\r\nthat female chieftains were found ruling in the provinces of Suwo and\r\nBingo. They were not aliens, but belonged to the Yamato race, and\r\ntheir existence goes far to account for the appellation, \"Queens'\r\nCountry,\" applied by Chinese historians to the only part of Japan\r\nwith which the people of the Middle Kingdom were familiar, namely,\r\nKyushu and the west-coast provinces. Keiko's reign is remarkable\r\nchiefly for this expedition to the south, which involved a residence\r\nof six years in Hyuga, and for the campaigns of one of the greatest\r\nof Japan's heroes, Prince Yamato-dake. The military prowess of the\r\nsovereign, the fighting genius of Yamato-dake, and the administrative\r\nability of Takenouchi-no-Sukune, the first \"prime minister\" mentioned\r\nin Japanese history, combined to give signal eclat to the reign of\r\nKeiko.\r\n\r\nArriving at this stage of the annals, we are able to perceive what an\r\ninfluence was exercised on the fortunes of the country by its\r\ntopographical features. The southwestern sections of the islands are\r\ncomparatively accessible from the centre (Chogoku or Kinai), whether\r\nby sea or by land, but the northeastern are guarded by mountain\r\nchains which can be crossed only by arduous and easily defended\r\npasses. It was, therefore, in these northeastern provinces that the\r\nYemishi maintained their independence until their strength was broken\r\nby the splendid campaign of Yamato-dake; it was in these northeastern\r\nprovinces that the bushi, noblest product of Japanese civilization,\r\nwas nurtured; it was in the same provinces that the Taira family made\r\nits brilliant debut, and it was by abandoning these provinces for the\r\nsweets of Kyoto that the Taira fell; it was in the north-eastern\r\nprovinces that Minamoto Yoritomo, the father of military feudalism,\r\nestablished himself, to be followed in succession by the Hojo, the\r\nAshikaga, and the Tokugawa, and it is in the northeastern provinces\r\nthat the Meiji Government has its seat of power.\r\n\r\nWe can not wonder, therefore, that modern historiographers have\r\ndevoted much labour to tracing the route followed by Yamato-dake's\r\ntroops and rationalizing the figurative or miraculous features of the\r\nnarratives told in the Kojiki and the Nihongi. It is enough to know,\r\nhowever, that he overran the whole region stretching from the\r\nprovinces along the Eastern Sea as far as Iwaki; crossed westward\r\nthrough Iwashiro to Echigo on the west coast, and turning southward,\r\nmade his way through Shinano and Mino to Owari, whence, suffering\r\nfrom a wound caused by a poisoned arrow, he struggled on to Ise and\r\ndied there. This campaign seems to have occupied ten years, and\r\nYamato-dake was only thirty at the time of his death. He had marched\r\nagainst the Kumaso in the south at the age of sixteen. The Chronicles\r\nrelate that when crossing the Usui Pass and looking down on the sea\r\nwhere his loved consort had cast herself into the waves to quell\r\ntheir fury, the great warrior sighed thrice and exclaimed, \"My wife,\r\nmy wife, my wife!\" (Ago, tsuma haya), whereafter the provinces east\r\nof the mountain were designated Azuma.\r\n\r\nIt was imagined until quite recent times that the pass referred to\r\nwas the well-known Usui Toge on the Nakasendo road; but Dr. Kume has\r\nshown that such a supposition is inconsistent with any rational\r\nitinerary of Yamato-dake's march, and that the sea in question cannot\r\nbe seen from that defile. The pass mentioned in the Chronicles is\r\nanother of the same name not far from the Hakone region, and the term\r\n\"Azuma\" \"had always been used to designate the Eastern Provinces.\"\r\nThroughout the Records and the Chronicles frequent instances occur of\r\nattempts to derive place-names from appropriate legends, but probably\r\nin many cases the legend was suggested by the name. In connexion with\r\nYamato-dake's career, a circumstance is recorded which indirectly\r\npoints to the absence of history at that period. In order to\r\nimmortalize the memory of the hero, hereditary corporations (be)\r\ncalled after him were created. These Take-be gave their names to the\r\ndistricts where they lived, in Ise, Izumo, Mimasaka, and Bizen.\r\n\r\nFEMALE HOSTAGES\r\n\r\nAnother custom inaugurated by this sovereign was to require that the\r\nrulers of provinces should send to the Yamato Court female hostages.\r\nThe first example of this practice took place on the occasion of an\r\nImperial visit to the regions overrun by Yamato-dake's forces. Each\r\nof twelve kuni-yatsuko (provincial rulers) was required to send one\r\ndamsel for the purpose of serving in the culinary department of the\r\npalace. They were called makura-ko (pillow-child) and they seem to\r\nhave been ultimately drafted into the ranks of the uneme\r\n(ladies-in-waiting). Japanese historians hold that the makura-ko were\r\ndaughters of the local magnates by whom they were sent, though the\r\nfact of that relationship is not clearly stated in either the Records\r\nor the Chronicles.\r\n\r\nTABE AND MIYAKE\r\n\r\nIn the annals of Suinin's reign brief reference is made to granaries\r\n(miyake) erected by order of the Court. The number of these was\r\nincreased in Keiko's time, and it is further mentioned that a\r\nhereditary corporation of rice-field cultivators (tabe) were\r\norganized for service on the Imperial estates. The miyake were at\r\nonce storehouse and offices for administering agricultural affairs.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTEENTH EMPEROR, SEIMU (A.D. 131--190)\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth Emperor, Seimu, occupied the throne for fifty-nine\r\nyears, according to the Chronicles, but the only noteworthy feature\r\nof his reign was the organization of local government, and the\r\ndetails of his system are so vaguely stated as to be incomprehensible\r\nwithout much reference and some hypotheses. Speaking broadly, the\r\nfacts are these: Imperial princes who had distinguished themselves by\r\nevidences of ability or courage were despatched to places of special\r\nimportance in the provinces, under the name of wake, a term conveying\r\nthe signification of \"branch of the Imperial family.\" There is reason\r\nto think that these appointments were designed to extend the prestige\r\nof the Court rather than to facilitate the administration of\r\nprovincial affairs. The latter duty was entrusted to officials called\r\nkuni-no-miyatsuko and agata-nushi, which may be translated\r\n\"provincial governor\" and \"district headman.\" The word miyatsuko\r\nliterally signifies \"honourable (mi) servant (yatsuko or yakko).\"\r\n\r\nIn the most ancient times all subjects were yakko, but subsequently\r\nthose holding office at Court were distinguished as omi (grandee).\r\nPersons eligible for the post of provincial governor seem to have\r\nbeen chosen from among men of merit, or Imperial princes, or chiefs\r\nof aboriginal tribes. There was little exclusiveness in this respect.\r\nThe rate of expansion of the area under Imperial sway may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that whereas there were nine provinces (kuni) in\r\nJimmu's time, one was added by Kaikwa, eleven by Sujin, seven by\r\nKeiko, and sixty-three by Seimu, making a total of ninety-one. Yet,\r\nthough by the time of the last named sovereign almost the whole of\r\nthe southern and central regions were included in the administrative\r\ncircle, the northern provinces, some of the western, and certain\r\nregions in the south (Kyushu) were not yet fully wrested from the\r\nYemishi and the Kumaso. In subsequent reigns the rate of growth was\r\nas follows: Chuai (A.D. 192-200), two provinces; Ojin (270-310),\r\ntwenty-one; Nintoku (313-399), seven; Hansho (406-411) and Inkyo\r\n(412-453), one each; Yuryaku (457-459), three; Keitai (507-531), one;\r\nand eight others at untraceable periods, the total being one hundred\r\nthirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe agata was a division smaller than a province (kuni). It\r\ncorresponded to the modern kori or gun, and its nearest English\r\nequivalent is \"district.\" A distinction must be made, however,\r\nbetween agata and mi-agata. The latter were Imperial domains whence\r\nthe Court derived its resources, and their dimensions varied greatly.\r\nA smaller administrative district than the agata was the inagi.* This\r\nwe learn from a Chinese book--the Japanese annals being silent on the\r\nsubject--consisted of eighty houses, and ten inagi constituted a\r\nkuni. The terra inagi was also applied to the chief local official of\r\nthe region, who may be designated \"Mayor.\"\r\n\r\n*Supposed to be derived from ine (rice) and oki (store).\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTEENTH EMPEROR, CHUAI (A.D. 192--200) AND THE EMPRESS JINGO\r\n(A.D. 201--269)\r\n\r\nWere the Records our sole guide, the early incidents of Chuai's reign\r\nwould be wrapped in obscurity. For when we first meet him in the\r\npages of the Kojiki, he is in a palace on the northern shores of the\r\nShimonoseki Strait, whence he soon crosses to the Kashii palace in\r\nKyushu. His predecessors, while invariably changing their residences\r\non mounting the throne, had always chosen a site for the new palace\r\nin Yamato or a neighbouring province, but the Records, without any\r\nexplanation, carry Chuai to the far south after his accession. The\r\nChronicles are more explicit. From them we gather that Chuai--who was\r\nthe second son of Yamato-dake and is described as having been ten\r\nfeet high with \"a countenance of perfect beauty\"--was a remarkably\r\nactive sovereign. He commenced his reign by a progress to Tsuruga\r\n(then called Tsunuga) on the west coast of the mainland, and, a month\r\nlater, he made an expedition to Kii on the opposite shore. While in\r\nthe latter province he received news of a revolt of the Kumaso, and\r\nat once taking ship, he went by sea to Shimonoseki, whither he\r\nsummoned the Empress from Tsuruga. An expedition against the Kumaso\r\nwas then organized and partially carried out, but the Emperor's force\r\nwas beaten and he himself received a fatal arrow-wound. Both the\r\nRecords and the Chronicles relate that, on the eve of this disastrous\r\nmove against the Kumaso, the Empress had a revelation urging the\r\nEmperor to turn his arms against Korea as the Kumaso were not worthy\r\nof his steel. But Chuai rejected the advice with scorn, and the\r\nKojiki alleges that the outraged deities punished him with death,\r\nthough doubtless a Kumaso arrow was the instrument. His demise was\r\ncarefully concealed, and the Empress, mustering the troops, took\r\nvengeance upon the Kumaso.\r\n\r\nThereafter her Majesty became the central figure in a page of\r\nhistory--or romance--which has provoked more controversy than any\r\nincident in Japanese annals. A descendant of the Korean prince,\r\nAma-no-Hihoko, who settled in the province of Tajima during the reign\r\nof the Emperor Suinin, she must have possessed traditional knowledge\r\nof Shiragi, whence her ancestor had emigrated. She was the third\r\nconsort of Chuai. His first had borne him two sons who were of adult\r\nage when, in the second year of his reign, he married Jingo,* a lady\r\n\"intelligent, shrewd, and with a countenance of such blooming\r\nloveliness that her father wondered at it.\" To this appreciation of\r\nher character must be added the attributes of boundless ambition and\r\nbrave resourcefulness. The annals represent her as bent from the\r\noutset on the conquest of Korea and as receiving the support and\r\nencouragement of Takenouchi-no-Sukune, who had served her husband and\r\nhis predecessor as prime minister. A military expedition oversea led\r\nby a sovereign in person had not been heard of since the days of\r\nJimmu, and to reconcile officials and troops to such an undertaking\r\nthe element of divine revelation had to be introduced. At every stage\r\nsigns and portents were vouchsafed by the guardian deities. By their\r\nintervention the Empress was shown to be possessed of miraculous\r\nprowess, and at their instance troops and ships assembled\r\nspontaneously. The armada sailed under divine guidance, a gentle\r\nspirit protecting the Empress, and a warlike spirit leading the van\r\nof her forces. The god of the wind sent a strong breeze; the god of\r\nthe sea ruled the waves favourably; all the great fishes accompanied\r\nthe squadron, and an unprecendented tide bore the ships far inland.\r\nFighting became unnecessary. The King of Shiragi did homage at once\r\nand promised tribute and allegiance forever, and the other monarchs\r\nof the peninsula followed his example. In short, Korea was conquered\r\nand incorporated with the dominions of Japan.\r\n\r\n*It should be clearly understood that the names by which the\r\nsovereigns are called in these pages, are the posthumous appellations\r\ngiven to them in later times when Chinese ideographs came into use\r\nand Chinese customs began to be followed in such matters. The\r\nposthumous was compiled with reference to the character or\r\nachievements of the sovereign, Thus Jingo signifies \"divine merit,\"\r\non account of her conquests; \"Chuai\" means \"lamentable second son,\"\r\nwith reference to his evil fate, and \"Keiko\" implies \"great deeds.\"\r\nThese three sovereigns were called during life, Okinaga-Tarashi,\r\nTarashi-Nakatsu, and 0-Tarashi, respectively.\r\n\r\nCRITICISM OF THE ALLEGED CONQUEST OF KOREA\r\n\r\nBy some learned historiographers the whole of the above account is\r\npronounced a fiction. There was no such invasion of Korea, they say,\r\nnor does the narrative deserve more credit than the legend of the\r\nArgonauts or the tale of Troy. But that is probably too drastic a\r\nview. There can indeed be little doubt that the compilers of the\r\nNihongi embellished the bald tradition with imaginary details; used\r\nnames which did not exist until centuries after the epoch referred\r\nto; drew upon the resources of Chinese history for the utterances\r\nthey ascribe to the Empress and for the weapons they assign to her\r\nsoldiers, and were guilty of at least two serious anachronisms.\r\n\r\nBut none of these faults disfigures the story as told in the pages of\r\nthe Kojiki, which was written before the Nihongi. It has always to be\r\nremembered that the compilers of the latter essayed the impossible\r\ntask of adjusting a new chronology to events extending over many\r\ncenturies, and that the resulting discrepancies of dates does not\r\nnecessarily discredit the events themselves. It has also to be\r\nremembered that the same compilers were required to robe their facts\r\nin Chinese costume and that the consequent ill-fits and\r\nartificialities do not of necessity vitiate the facts. In the\r\nparticular case under consideration did the Kojiki stand alone,\r\nlittle doubt would ever have been entertained about the reality of an\r\narmed expedition to Korea, under the Empress Jingo. The sober and\r\nunexaggerated narrative of that history would have been accepted,\r\nless only the miraculous portents which accompany it.\r\n\r\nAs to the date of the invasion, however, it must have remained\r\nobscure: the Kojiki's narrative furnishes one clue. According to\r\nKorean history, an apparently unimportant descent upon Sinra\r\n(Shiragi) took place in A.D. 219; a more serious one in 233, when the\r\nJapanese ships were burned and their crews massacred, and a still\r\nmore formidable one in 249, when a Sinra statesman who had brought on\r\nthe invasion by using insulting language towards the sovereign of\r\nJapan in presence of a Japanese ambassador, gave himself up to the\r\nJapanese in the hope of appeasing their anger. They burnt him, and\r\nproceeded to besiege Keumsyong, the Sinra capital, but were\r\nultimately beaten off. \"No less than twenty-five descents by Japanese\r\non the Sinra coast are mentioned in Korean history in the first five\r\ncenturies of the Christian era, but it is impossible to identify any\r\none of them with Jingo's expedition.\" [Aston.] Nevertheless, modern\r\nJapanese historians are disposed to assign the Jingo invasion to the\r\nyear 364, when Nai-mul ruled Shiragi, from which monarch's era\r\ntribute seems to have been regularly sent to Yamato. Indeed the pages\r\nof the Nihongi which deal with the last sixty years of Jingo's reign\r\nare devoted almost entirely to descriptions of incidents connected\r\nwith the receipt of tribute and the advent or despatch of envoys. The\r\nchronology is certainly erroneous. In no less than four several cases\r\nevents obviously the same are attributed by the Korean annals to\r\ndates differing from those of the Nihongi by exactly two cycles; and\r\nin one important instance the Japanese work assigns to A.D. 205 an\r\noccurrence which the Tongkan* puts in the year 418.\r\n\r\n*Korean history. Its full title is Tong-kuk-lhong-kan.\r\n\r\nWhichever annals be correct--and the balance sways in favour of the\r\nKorean so far as those protohistoric eras are concerned--\"there can\r\nbe no doubt that Japan, at an early period, formed an alliance with\r\nPaikche\" (spoken of in Japan as \"Kudara,\" namely, the regions\r\nsurrounding the modern Seoul), \"and laid the foundation of a\r\ncontrolling power over the territory known as Imna (or Mimana), which\r\nlasted for several centuries.\" [Aston.] One evidence of this control\r\nis furnished in the establishment of an office called uchi-tsu-miyake\r\nin addition to the chinju-fu already spoken of. From early times it\r\nhad been customary in Japan that whenever any lands were acquired, a\r\nportion of them was included in the Imperial domain, the produce\r\nbeing thenceforth stored and the affairs of the estate managed at a\r\nmiyake presided over by a mikoto-mochi. Thus, on the inclusion of\r\ncertain Korean districts in Japan's dominions, this usage was\r\nobserved, and the new miyake had the syllables uchi-tsu (\"of the\r\ninterior\") prefixed to distinguish it as a part of Japan. It is on\r\nrecord that a mikoto-mochi was stationed in Shiragi, and in the days\r\nof Jingo's son (Ojin) the great statesman, Takenouchi-no-Sukune, took\r\nup his residence for a time in Tsukushi to assist this mikoto-mochi\r\nand the chinju-fu, should occasion arise. Modern Japanese historians\r\ndescribe this era as the first period of Japanese national\r\ndevelopment, for an almost immediate result of the oversea relations\r\nthus established was that silk and cotton fabrics of greatly improved\r\nquality, gold, silver, iron, implements, arts, and literature were\r\nimported in increasing quantities to the great benefit of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nSHIFTING OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nAn important change dates from the reign of Jingo. It has been shown\r\nabove that, from a period prior to the death of Suinin, the power and\r\ninfluence of the Imperial princes and nobles was a constantly growing\r\nquantity. But the political situation developed a new phase when the\r\nSukune family appeared upon the scene. The first evidence of this was\r\nmanifested in a striking incident. When the Emperor Chuai died, his\r\nconsort, Jingo, was enceinte* But the Emperor left two sons by a\r\nprevious marriage, and clearly one of them should have succeeded to\r\nthe throne. Nevertheless, the prime minister, Takenouchi-no-Sukune,\r\ncontrived to have the unborn child recognized as Prince Imperial.**\r\nNaturally the deceased Emperor's two elder sons refused to be\r\narbitrarily set aside in favour of a baby step-brother. The principle\r\nof primogeniture did not possess binding force in those days, but it\r\nhad never previously been violated except by the deliberate and\r\nostensibly reasonable choice of an Emperor. The two princes,\r\ntherefore, called their partisans to arms and prepared to resist the\r\nreturn of Jingo to Yamato. Here again Takenouchi-no-Sukune acted a\r\ngreat part. He carried the child by the outer sea to a place of\r\nsafety in Kii, while the forces of the Empress sailed up the Inland\r\nSea to meet the brothers at Naniwa (modern Osaka). Moreover, when the\r\nfinal combat took place, this same Takenouchi devised a strategy\r\nwhich won the day, and in every great event during the reign of the\r\nEmpress his figure stands prominent. Finally, his granddaughter\r\nbecame the consort of the Emperor Nintoku (313-399), an alliance\r\nwhich opened a channel for exercising direct influence upon the\r\nThrone and also furnished a precedent adopted freely in subsequent\r\ntimes by other noble families harbouring similarly ambitious aims. In\r\nshort, from the accession of the Empress Jingo a large part of the\r\nsovereign power began to pass into the hands of the prime minister.\r\n\r\n*As illustrating the confused chronology of the Nihongi, it may be\r\nnoted that, calculated by the incident of Chuai's career, he must\r\nhave been fully one hundred years old when he begot this child. That\r\nis marvellous enough, but to add to the perplexity the Nihongi says\r\nthat Chuai died at fifty-two.\r\n\r\n**The legend says of this child that its birth was artificially\r\ndelayed until the return of the empress from the Korean expedition,\r\nbut the fact seems to be that the Emperor died at the end of June and\r\nthe Empress' accouchement took place in the following April.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DEVIL WITH DRAGON HEAD (Sculptured Wood Figure in the\r\nMuseum at Kyoto)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HORSE RACE IN OLD JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PREHISTORIC SOVEREIGNS (Continued)\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nAT the beginning of the previous chapter brief reference was made to\r\nthe three great divisions of the inhabitants of Japan; namely, the\r\nShimbetsu (Kami class) the Kwobetsu (Imperial class) and the Bambetsu\r\n(aboriginal class). The Shimbetsu comprised three sub-classes;\r\nnamely, first, the Tenjin, a term used to designate the descendants\r\nof the great primeval trinity and of the other Kami prior to the Sun\r\ngoddess; secondly, the Tenson, or descendants of the Sun goddess to\r\nJimmu's father (Ugaya-fukiaezu), and thirdly, the Chigi, an\r\nappellation applied to the chiefs found in Izumo by the envoys of the\r\nSun goddess and in Yamato by Jimmu--chiefs who, though deprived of\r\npower, were recognized to be of the same lineage as their conquerors.\r\nIt is plain that few genealogical trees could be actually traced\r\nfurther back than the Chigi. Hence, for all practical purposes, the\r\nShimbetsu consisted of the descendants of vanquished chiefs, and the\r\nfact was tacitly acknowledged by assigning to this class the second\r\nplace in the social scale, though the inclusion of the Tenjin and the\r\nTenson should have assured its precedence. The Kwobetsu comprised all\r\nEmperors and Imperial princes from Jimmu downwards. This was the\r\npremier class. The heads of all its families possessed as a\r\nbirthright the title of omi (grandee), while the head of a Shimbetsu\r\nfamily was a muraji (group-chief). The Bambetsu ranked incomparably\r\nbelow either the Kwobetsu or the Shimbetsu. It consisted of\r\nforeigners who had immigrated from China or Korea and of aboriginal\r\ntribes alien to the Yamato race. Members of the Ban class were\r\ndesignated yakko (or yatsuko), a term signifying \"subject\" or\r\n\"servant.\"\r\n\r\nTHE UJI\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above three-class distribution, the whole Yamato\r\nnation was divided into uji, or families. An uji founded by one of\r\nthe Tenson took precedence of all others, the next in rank being one\r\nwith an Imperial prince for ancestor, and after the latter came the\r\nfamilies of the Tenjin and Chigi. All that could not thus trace their\r\ngenealogy were attached to the various uji in a subordinate capacity.\r\nIt is not to be supposed that one of these families consisted simply\r\nof a husband and wife, children, and servants. There were great uji\r\nand small uji, the former comprising many of the latter, and the\r\nsmall uji including several households. In fact, the small uji\r\n(ko-uji) may be described as a congeries of from fifty to ninety\r\nblood relations.\r\n\r\nIn the uji the principle of primogeniture was paramount. A successor\r\nto the headship of an uji must be the eldest son of an eldest son.\r\nThus qualified, he became the master of the household, ruled the\r\nwhole family, and controlled its entire property. The chief of an\r\nordinary uji (uji no Kami) governed all the households constituting\r\nit, and the chief of a great uji (o-uji no Kami) controlled all the\r\nsmall uji of which it was composed. In addition to the members of a\r\nfamily, each uji, small and great alike, had a number of dependants\r\n(kakibe or tomobe). In colloquial language, an o-uji was the original\r\nfamily; a ko-uji, a branch family. For example, if the Abe family be\r\nconsidered, Abe-uji is a great uji (o-uji), while such names as Abe\r\nno Shii, Abe no Osada, Abe no Mutsu, etc., designate small uji\r\n(ko-uji). If a great uji was threatened with extinction through lack\r\nof heir, the proper Kami of a small uji succeeded to the vacant\r\nplace. As for the kakibe or tomobe, they were spoken of as \"so and so\r\nof such and such an uji:\" they had no uji of their own.\r\n\r\nAll complications of minor importance were dealt with by the Kami* of\r\nthe uji in which they occurred, consultation being held with the Kami\r\nof the appropriate o-uji in great cases. Reference was not made to\r\nthe Imperial Court except in serious matters. On the other hand,\r\ncommands from the sovereign were conveyed through the head of an\r\no-uji, so that the chain of responsibility was well defined. An\r\ninteresting feature of this ancient organization was that nearly\r\nevery uji had a fixed occupation which was hereditary, the name of\r\nthe occupation being prefixed to that of the uji. Thus, the uji of\r\ngem-polishers was designated Tamatsukuri-uji, and that of boat\r\nbuilders, Fune-uji.\r\n\r\n*An uji no Kami was called uji no choja in later ages.\r\n\r\nThere were also uji whose members, from generation to generation,\r\nacted as governors of provinces (kuni no miyatsuko) or headmen of\r\ndistricts (agata-nushi). In these cases the name of the region was\r\nprefixed to the uji; as Munakata-uji, Izumo-uji, etc. Finally, there\r\nwere uji that carried designations given by the sovereign in\r\nrecognition of meritorious deeds. These designations took the form of\r\ntitles. Thus the captor of a crane, at sight of which a dumb prince\r\nrecovered his speech, was called Totori no Miyatsuko (the\r\nbird-catching governor), and Nomi-no-Sukune, who devised the\r\nsubstitution of clay figures (haniwa) for human sacrifices at\r\nImperial obsequies, was designated as Hashi no Omi (the Pottery\r\nGrandee).\r\n\r\nTHE TOMOBE\r\n\r\nThe tomobe (attendants)--called also mure (the herd) or kakibe\r\n(domestics)--constituted an important element of the people. They\r\nwere, in fact, serfs. We find them first spoken of in an active role\r\nas being sent to the provinces to provide foodstuffs for the Imperial\r\nhousehold, and in that capacity they went by the name of provincial\r\nImibe. Perhaps the most intelligible description of them is that they\r\nconstituted the peasant and artisan class, and that they were\r\nattached to the uji in subordinate positions for purposes of manual\r\nlabour. By degrees, when various kinds of productive operations came\r\nto be engaged in as hereditary pursuits, the tomobe were grouped\r\naccording to the specialty of the uji to which they wore attached,\r\nand we hear of Kanuchibe, or the corporation of blacksmiths; Yumibe,\r\nor the corporation of bow-makers; Oribe, or the corporation of\r\nweavers, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed, however, that all the tomobe were thus\r\norganized as special classes. Such was the case only when the\r\nuji to which they belonged pursued some definite branch of\r\nproductive work. Moreover, there were corporations instituted\r\nfor purposes quite independent of industry; namely, to perpetuate\r\nthe memory of an Imperial or princely personage who had died without\r\nissue or without attaining ancestral rank. Such tomobe were\r\ncollectively known as nashiro (namesakes) or koshiro (child\r\nsubstitutes). For example, when Prince Itoshi, son of the Emperor\r\nSuinin, died without leaving a son to perpetuate his name, the\r\nItoshibe was established for that purpose; and when Prince\r\nYamato-dake perished without ascending the throne, the Takebe was\r\nformed to preserve the memory of his achievements. A be thus\r\norganized on behalf of an Emperor had the title of toneri\r\n(chamberlain) suffixed. Thus, for the Emperor Ohatsuse (known in\r\nhistory as Yuryaku) the Hatsuse-be-no-toneri was formed; and for\r\nthe Emperor Shiraga (Seinei), the Shiraga-be-no-toneri. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that underlying the creation of these nashiro was the\r\naim of extending the Imperial estates, as well as the number of\r\nsubjects over whom the control of the Throne could be exercised\r\nwithout the intervention of an uji no Kami. For it is to be observed\r\nthat the sovereign himself was an o-uji no Kami, and all tomobe\r\ncreated for nashiro purposes or to discharge some other functions\r\nin connexion with the Court were attached to the Imperial uji.\r\n\r\nTAMIBE\r\n\r\nAnother kind of be consisted of aliens who had been naturalized in\r\nJapan or presented to the Japanese Throne by foreign potentates.\r\nThese were formed into tamibe (corporations of people). They became\r\ndirectly dependent upon the Court, and they devoted themselves to\r\nmanufacturing articles for the use of the Imperial household. These\r\nnaturalized persons were distinguished, in many cases, by technical\r\nskill or literary attainments. Hence they received treatment\r\ndifferent from that given to ordinary tomobe, some of them being\r\nallowed to assume the title and enjoy the privilege of uji,\r\ndistinguished, however, as uji of the Bambetsu. Thus, the descendants\r\nof the seamstresses, E-hime and Oto-hime, and of the weavers,\r\nKure-hatori and Ana-hatori, who were presented to the Yamato Court by\r\nan Emperor of the Wu dynasty in China, were allowed to organize\r\nthemselves into Kinu-nui-uji (uji of Silk-robe makers); and that a\r\nHata-uji (Weavers' uji) was similarly organized is proved by a\r\npassage in the records of the Emperor Ojin (A.D. 284) which relates\r\nthat the members of the Hata-uji had become scattered about the\r\ncountry and were carrying on their manufacturing work in various\r\njurisdictions. This fact having been related to the Throne, steps\r\nwere taken to bring together all these weavers into the Hata-uji, and\r\nto make them settle at villages to which the name of Kachibe was\r\ngiven in commemoration of the weavers' ancestor, Kachi. The records\r\nshow that during the first four centuries of the Christian era the\r\npeople presented to the Yamato Court by the sovereigns of the Wu\r\ndynasty and of Korea must have been very numerous, for no less than\r\n710 uji were formed by them in consideration of their skill in the\r\narts and crafts.\r\n\r\nSLAVES\r\n\r\nThe institution of slavery (nuhi) existed in ancient Japan as in so\r\nmany other countries. The slaves consisted of prisoners taken in war\r\nand of persons who, having committed some serious offence, were\r\nhanded over to be the property of those that they had injured. The\r\nfirst recorded instance of the former practice was when Yamato-dake\r\npresented to the Ise shrine the Yemishi chiefs who had surrendered to\r\nhim in the sequel of his invasion of the eastern provinces. The same\r\nfate seems to have befallen numerous captives made in the campaign\r\nagainst the Kumaso, and doubtless wholesale acts of self-destruction\r\ncommitted by Tsuchi-gumo and Kumaso when overtaken by defeat were\r\nprompted by preference of death to slavery. The story of Japan's\r\nrelations with Korea includes many references to Korean prisoners who\r\nbecame the property of their captors, and that a victorious general's\r\nspoils should comprise some slaves may be described as a recognized\r\ncustom. Of slavery as a consequence of crime there is also frequent\r\nmention, and it would appear that even men of rank might be overtaken\r\nby that fate, for when (A.D. 278) Takenouchi-no-Sukune's younger\r\nbrother was convicted of slandering him, the culprit's punishment\r\ntook the form of degradation and assignment to a life of slavery. The\r\nwhole family of such an offender shared his fate. There is no\r\nevidence, however, that the treatment of the nuhi was inhuman or even\r\nharsh: they appear to have fared much as did the tomobe in general.\r\n\r\nTHE LAND\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of territorial rights, and these, though now\r\nclearly differentiated, were more or less confounded in ancient\r\nJapan. One is the ruler's right--that is to say, competence to impose\r\ntaxes; to enact rules governing possession; to appropriate private\r\nlands for public purposes, and to treat as crown estates land not\r\nprivately owned. The second is the right of possession; namely, the\r\nright to occupy definite areas of land and to apply them to one's own\r\nends. At present those two rights are distinct. A landowner has no\r\ncompetence to issue public orders with regard to it, and a lessee of\r\nland has to discharge certain responsibilities towards the lessor. It\r\nwas not so in old Japan. As the Emperor's right to rule the people\r\nwas not exercised over an individual direct but through the uji no\r\nKami who controlled that individual, so the sovereign's right over\r\nthe land was exercised through the territorial owner, who was usually\r\nthe uji no Kami. The latter, being the owner of the land, leased a\r\npart of it to the members of the uji, collected a percentage of the\r\nproduce, and presented a portion to the Court when occasion demanded.\r\nHence, so long as the sovereign's influence was powerful, the uji no\r\nKami and other territorial magnates, respecting his orders, refrained\r\nfrom levying taxes and duly paid their appointed contributions to the\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nBut in later times, when the Throne's means of enforcing its orders\r\nceased to bear any sensible ratio to the puissance of the uji no Kami\r\nand other local lords, the Imperial authority received scanty\r\nrecognition, and the tillers of the soil were required to pay heavy\r\ntaxes to their landlords. It is a fallacy to suppose that the Emperor\r\nin ancient times not only ruled the land but also owned it. The only\r\nland held in direct possession by the Throne was that constituting\r\nthe Imperial household's estates and that belonging to members of the\r\nImperial family. The private lands of the Imperial family were called\r\nmi-agata.* The province of Yamato contained six of these estates, and\r\ntheir produce was wholly devoted to the support of the Court. Lands\r\ncultivated for purposes of State revenue were called miyake.** They\r\nexisted in several provinces, the custom being that when land was\r\nnewly acquired, a miyake was at once established and the remainder\r\nwas assigned to princes or Court nobles (asomi or asori). The\r\ncultivators of miyake were designated ta-be (rustic corporation); the\r\noverseers were termed ta-zukasa (or mi-ta no tsukasa), and the\r\nofficials in charge of the stores were mi-agata no obito.\r\n\r\n*The prefix mi (honourable) was and is still used for purposes of\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n**In ancient Japan, officials and their offices were often designated\r\nalike. Thus, miyake signified a public estate or the store for\r\nkeeping the produce, just as tsukasa was applied alike to an overseer\r\nand to his place of transacting business.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 3 B.C., according to Japanese chronology, we read of\r\nthe establishment of a miyake, and doubtless that was not the first.\r\nThenceforth there are numerous examples of a similar measure.\r\nConfiscated lands also formed a not unimportant part of the Court's\r\nestates. Comparatively trifling offences were sometimes thus\r\nexpiated. Thus, in A.D. 350, Aganoko, suzerain of the Saegi, being\r\nconvicted of purloining jewels from the person of a princess whom he\r\nhad been ordered to execute, escaped capital punishment only by\r\nsurrendering all his lands; and, in A.D. 534, a provincial ruler who,\r\nbeing in mortal terror, had intruded into the ladies' apartments in\r\nthe palace, had to present his landed property for the use of the\r\nEmpress. These facts show incidentally that the land of the country,\r\nthough governed by the sovereign, was not owned by him. Lands in a\r\nconquered country were naturally regarded as State property, but\r\nsufficient allusion has already been made to that custom.\r\n\r\nTHE SPHERE OF THE SOVEREIGN'S RULE\r\n\r\nIt is related in the Records that, in prehistoric days, the last of\r\nthe chieftains sent by Amaterasu to wrest Japan from its then holders\r\naddressed the leaders of the latter in these terms, \"The central land\r\nof reed plains owned (ushi-haku) by you is the country to be governed\r\n(shirasu) by my son.\" Japanese historiographers attach importance to\r\nthe different words here used. Ushi-haku signifies \"to hold in\r\nintimate lordship\"--as one wears a garment--whereas shirasu means \"to\r\nexercise public rights as head of a State.\" A Japanese Emperor\r\noccupied both positions towards mi-nashiro (q.v.), toward naturalized\r\nor conquered folks, towards mi-agata, miyake, and confiscated\r\nestates, but his functions with regard to the people and the land in\r\ngeneral were limited to governing (shirasu).\r\n\r\nIf the ancient prerogatives of the sovereign be tabulated, they stand\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n(1) to conduct the worship of the national deities as general head of\r\nall the uji;\r\n\r\n(2) to declare war against foreign countries and to make peace with\r\nthem, as representative of the uji, and (3) to establish or abolish\r\nuji, to nominate uji no Kami, and to adjudicate disputes between\r\nthem. The first of these prerogatives remains unaltered to the\r\npresent day. The second was partly delegated in medieval times to the\r\nmilitary class, but has now been restored to the Throne. As for the\r\nthird, its exercise is to-day limited to the office of the hereditary\r\nnobility, the Constitution having replaced the Crown in other\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years have seen no change in the Emperor's function of\r\nofficiating as the high priest of the nation. It was the sovereign\r\nwho made offerings to the deities of heaven and earth at the great\r\nreligious festivals. It was the sovereign who prayed for the aid of\r\nthe gods when the country was confronted by any emergency or when the\r\npeople suffered from pestilence. In short, though the powers of the\r\nEmperor over the land and the people were limited by the intervention\r\nof the uji, the whole nation was directly subservient to the Throne\r\nin matters relating to religion. From the earliest eras, too, war\r\nmight not be declared without an Imperial rescript, and to the\r\nEmperor was reserved the duty of giving audience to foreign envoys\r\nand receiving tribute. By foreign countries, China and Korea were\r\ngenerally understood, but the Kumaso, the Yemishi, and the Sushen\r\nwere also included in the category of aliens. It would seem that the\r\nobligation of serving the country in arms was universal, for in the\r\nreign of Sujin, when an oversea expedition was contemplated, the\r\npeople were numbered according to their ages, and the routine of\r\nservice was laid down. Contributions, too, had to be made, as is\r\nproved by the fact that a command of the same sovereign required the\r\nvarious districts to manufacture arms and store them in the shrines.\r\n\r\nTHE THRONE AND THE UJI\r\n\r\nThe sovereign's competence to adjudicate questions relating to the\r\nuji is illustrated by a notable incident referred to the year A.D.\r\n415, during the reign of Inkyo. Centuries had then passed since the\r\ninauguration of the uji, and families originally small with clearly\r\ndefined genealogies had multiplied to the dimensions of large clans,\r\nso that much confusion of lineage existed, and there was a\r\nwide-spread disposition to assert claims to spurious rank. It was\r\ntherefore commanded by the Emperor that, on a fixed day, all the uji\r\nno Kami should assemble, and having performed the rite of\r\npurification, should submit to the ordeal of boiling water\r\n(kuga-dachi). Numerous cauldrons were erected for the purpose, and it\r\nwas solemnly proclaimed that only the guilty would be scalded by the\r\ntest. At the last moment, those whose claims were willingly false\r\nabsconded, and the genealogies were finally rectified.\r\n\r\nInstances of uji created by the sovereign to reward merit, or\r\nabolished to punish offences, are numerously recorded. Thus, when\r\n(A.D. 413) the future consort of the Emperor Inkyo was walking in the\r\ngarden with her mother, a provincial ruler (miyatsuko), riding by,\r\nperemptorily called to her for a branch of orchid. She asked what he\r\nneeded the orchid for and he answered, \"To beat away mosquitoes when\r\nI travel mountain roads.\" \"Oh, honourable sir, I shall not forget,\"\r\nsaid the lady. When she became Empress, she caused the nobleman to be\r\nsought for, and had him deprived of his rank in lieu of execution.\r\nThere is also an instance of the killing of all the members of an uji\r\nto expiate the offence of the uji no Kami. This happened in A.D. 463,\r\nwhen Yuryaku sat on the throne. It was reported to the Court that\r\nSakitsuya, Kami of the Shimotsumichi-uji, indulged in pastimes\r\ndeliberately contrived to insult the occupant of the throne. Thus he\r\nwould match a little girl to combat against a grown woman, calling\r\nthe girl the Emperor and killing her if she won; or would set a\r\nlittle cock with clipped wings and plucked feathers to represent the\r\nsovereign in a fight with a big, lusty cock, which he likened to\r\nhimself, and if the small bird won, he would slaughter it with his\r\nown sword. The Emperor sent a company of soldiers, and Sakitsuya with\r\nall the seventy members of his uji were put to death.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe administrative organization in ancient Japan was simply a\r\ncombination of the uji. It was purely Japanese. Not until the seventh\r\ncentury of the Christian era were any foreign elements introduced.\r\nFrom ministers and generals of the highest class down to petty\r\nfunctionaries, all offices were discharged by uji no Kami, and as the\r\nlatter had the general name of kabane root of the uji the system was\r\nsimilarly termed. In effect, the kabane was an order of nobility.\r\nOffices were hereditary and equal. The first distribution of posts\r\ntook place when five chiefs, attached to the person of the Tenson at\r\nthe time of his descent upon Japan, were ordered to discharge at his\r\nCourt the same duties as those which had devolved on them in the\r\ncountry of their origin. The uji they formed were those of the\r\nShimbetsu,* the official title of the Kami being muraji (group chief)\r\nin the case of an ordinary uji, and o-muraji (great muraji) in the\r\ncase of an o-uji, as already stated. These were the men who rendered\r\nmost assistance originally in the organization of the State, but as\r\nthey were merely adherents of the Tenson, the latter's direct\r\ndescendants counted themselves superior and sought always to assert\r\nthat superiority.\r\n\r\n*The distinction of Shimbetsu and Kwobetsu was not nominally\r\nrecognized until the fourth century, but it undoubtedly existed in\r\npractice at an early date.\r\n\r\nThus, the title omi (grandee) held by the Kami of a Kwobetsu-uji was\r\ndeemed higher than that of muraji (chief) held by the Kami of a\r\nShimbetsu-uji. The blood relations of sovereigns either assisted at\r\nCourt in the administration of State affairs or went to the provinces\r\nin the capacity of governors. They received various titles in\r\naddition to that of omi, for example sukune (noble), ason or asomi\r\n(Court noble), kimi (duke), wake (lord), etc.\r\n\r\nHistory gives no evidence of a fixed official organization in ancient\r\ntimes. The method pursued by the sovereign was to summon such omi and\r\nmuraji as were notably influential or competent, and to entrust to\r\nthem the duty of discharging functions or dealing with a special\r\nsituation. Those so summoned were termed mae-isu-gimi (dukes of the\r\nPresence). The highest honour bestowed on a subject in those days\r\nfell to the noble, Takenouchi, who, in consideration of his services,\r\nwas named O-mae-tsu-gimi (great duke of the Presence) by the Emperor\r\nSeimu (A.D. 133). Among the omi and muraji, those conspicuously\r\npowerful were charged with the superintendence of several uji, and\r\nwere distinguished as o-omi and o-muraji. It became customary to\r\nappoint an o-omi and an o-muraji at the Court, just as in later days\r\nthere was a sa-daijin (minister of the Left) and an u-daijin\r\n(minister of the Right). The o-omi supervised all members of the\r\nKwobetsu-uji occupying administrative posts at Court, and the\r\no-muraji discharged a similar function in the case of members of\r\nShimbetsu-uji. Outside the capital local affairs were administered by\r\nkuni-no-miyatsuko or tomo-no-miyatsuko* Among the former, the heads\r\nof Kwobetsu-uji predominated among the latter, those of\r\nShimbetsu-uji.\r\n\r\n*Tomo is an abbreviation of tomo-be.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF LINEAGE\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that in old Japan lineage counted\r\nabove everything, alike officially and socially. The offices, the\r\nhonours and the lands were all in the hands of the lineal descendants\r\nof the original Yamato chiefs. Nevertheless the omi and the muraji\r\nstood higher in national esteem than the kuni-no-miyatsuko or the\r\ntomo-no-miyatsuko; the o-omi and the o-muraji, still higher; and the\r\nsovereign, at the apex of all. That much deference was paid to\r\nfunctions. Things remained unaltered in this respect until the sixth\r\ncentury when the force of foreign example began to make itself felt.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FISHERMAN'S BOAT AND NET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PREHISTORIC SOVEREIGNS (Continued)\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTEENTH SOVEREIGN, OJIN (A.D. 270-310)\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth Sovereign, Ojin, came to the throne at the age of\r\nseventy, according to the Chronicles, and occupied it for forty\r\nyears. Like a majority of the sovereigns in that epoch he had many\r\nconsorts and many children--three of the former (including two\r\nyounger sisters of the Emperor) and twenty of the latter. Comparison\r\nwith Korean history goes to indicate that the reign is antedated by\r\njust 120 years, or two of the sexagenary cycles, but of course such a\r\ncorrection cannot be applied to every incident of the era.\r\n\r\nMARITIME AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting features of Ojin's reign is that maritime\r\naffairs receive notice for the first time. It is stated that the\r\nfishermen of various places raised a commotion, refused to obey the\r\nImperial commands, and were not quieted until a noble, Ohama, was\r\nsent to deal with them. Nothing is stated as to the cause of this\r\ncomplication, but it is doubtless connected with requisitions of fish\r\nfor the Court, and probably the fishing folk of Japan had already\r\ndeveloped the fine physique and stalwart disposition that distinguish\r\ntheir modern representatives. Two years later, instructions were\r\nissued that hereditary corporations (be) of fishermen should be\r\nestablished in the provinces, and, shortly afterwards, the duty of\r\nconstructing a boat one hundred feet in length was imposed upon the\r\npeople of Izu, a peninsular province so remote from Yamato that its\r\nchoice for such a purpose is difficult to explain. There was no\r\nquestion of recompensing the builders of this boat: the product of\r\ntheir labour was regarded as \"tribute.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-six years later the Karano, as this vessel was called, having\r\nbecome unserviceable, the Emperor ordered a new Karano to be built,\r\nso as to perpetuate her name. A curious procedure is then recorded,\r\nillustrating the arbitrary methods of government in those days. The\r\ntimbers of the superannuated ship were used as fuel for roasting\r\nsalt, five hundred baskets of which were sent throughout the maritime\r\nprovinces, with orders that by each body of recipients a ship should\r\nbe constructed. Five hundred Karanos thus came into existence, and\r\nthere was assembled at Hyogo such a fleet as had never previously\r\nbeen seen in Japanese waters. A number of these new vessels were\r\ndestroyed almost immediately by a conflagration which broke out in\r\nthe lodgings of Korean envoys from Sinra (Shiragi), and the envoys\r\nbeing held responsible, their sovereign hastened to send a body of\r\nskilled shipmakers by way of atonement, who were thereafter organized\r\ninto a hereditary guild of marine architects, and we thus learn\r\nincidentally that the Koreans had already developed the shipbuilding\r\nskill destined to save their country in later ages.\r\n\r\nIDEALISM OF THE THIRD CENTURY\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the Karano incident, Japanese historians record a\r\ntale which materially helps our appreciation of the men of that\r\nremote age. A portion of the Karano's timber having emerged unscathed\r\nfrom the salt-pans, its indestructibility seemed curious enough to\r\nwarrant special treatment. It was accordingly made into a lute\r\n(koto),* and it justified that use by developing \"a ringing note that\r\ncould be heard from afar off.\" The Emperor composed a song on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n   \"The ship Karano\r\n   \"Was burned for salt:\r\n   \"Of the remainder\r\n   \"A koto was made.\r\n   \"When it is placed on\r\n   \"One hears the saya-saya\r\n   \"Of the summer trees,\r\n   \"Brushing against, as they stand,\r\n   \"The rocks of the mid-harbour,\r\n   \"The harbour of Yura.\" [Aston.]\r\n\r\n*The Japanese lute, otherwise called the Azuma koto, was an\r\ninstrument five or six feet long and having six strings. History\r\nfirst alludes to it in the reign of Jingo, and such as it was then,\r\nsuch it has remained until to-day.\r\n\r\nLAW, INDUSTRY, LOYALTY\r\n\r\nFive facts are already deducible from the annals of this epoch: the\r\nfirst, that there was no written law, unless the prohibitions in the\r\nRituals may be so regarded; the second, that there was no form of\r\njudicial trial, unless ordeal or torture may be so regarded; the\r\nthird, that the death penalty might be inflicted on purely ex-parte\r\nevidence; the fourth, that a man's whole family had to suffer the\r\npenalty of his crimes, and the fifth, that already in those remote\r\ntimes the code of splendid loyalty which has distinguished the\r\nJapanese race through all ages had begun to find disciples.\r\n\r\nAn incident of Ojin's reign illustrates all these things. Takenouchi,\r\nthe sukune (noble) who had served Ojin's mother so ably, and who had\r\nsaved Ojin's life in the latter's childhood, was despatched to\r\nTsukushi (Kyushu) on State business. During his absence his younger\r\nbrother accused him of designs upon the Emperor. At once, without\r\nfurther inquiry, Ojin sent men to kill the illustrious minister. But\r\nManeko, suzerain (atae) of Iki, who bore a strong resemblance to\r\nTakenouchi, personified him, and committing suicide, deceived the\r\nsoldiers who would have taken the sukune's life, so that the latter\r\nwas enabled to return to Yamato. Arriving at Court, he protested his\r\ninnocence and the ordeal of boiling water was employed. It took place\r\non the bank of the Shiki River. Takenouchi proving victorious; his\r\nbrother with all his family were condemned to become tomo-be of the\r\nsuzerain of Kii.\r\n\r\nTHE GRACE OF LIFE\r\n\r\nSide by side with these primitive conditions stands a romantic story\r\nof Ojin's self-denial in ceding to his son, Osazaki, a beautiful girl\r\nwhom the sovereign has destined to be his own consort. Discovering\r\nthat the prince loved her, Ojin invited him to a banquet in the\r\npalace, and, summoning the girl, made known by the aid of poetry his\r\nintention of surrendering her to his son, who, in turn, expressed his\r\ngratitude in verse. It is true that the character of this act of\r\nrenunciation is marred when we observe that Ojin was eighty years old\r\nat the time; nevertheless the graces of life were evidently not\r\nwanting in old-time Japan, nor did her historians deem them unworthy\r\nof prominent place in their pages. If at one moment they tell us of\r\nslanders and cruelty, at another they describe how a favourite\r\nconsort of Ojin, gazing with him at a fair landscape from a high\r\ntower, was moved to tears by the memory of her parents whom she had\r\nnot seen for years, and how the Emperor, sympathizing with her filial\r\naffection, made provision for her return home and took leave of her\r\nin verse:\r\n\r\n   \"Thou Island of Awaji\r\n   \"With thy double ranges;\r\n   \"Thou Island of Azuki\r\n   \"With thy double ranges\r\n   \"Ye good islands,\r\n   \"Ye have seen face to face\r\n   \"My spouse of Kibi.\"\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nThe most important feature of the Ojin era was the intercourse then\r\ninaugurated with China. It may be that after the establishment of the\r\nYamato race in Japan, emigrants from the neighbouring continent\r\nsettled, from early times, in islands so favoured by nature. If so,\r\nthey probably belonged to the lowest orders, for it was not until the\r\nthird and fourth centuries that men of erudition and skilled artisans\r\nbegan to arrive. Modern Japanese historians seem disposed to\r\nattribute this movement to the benign administration of the Emperor\r\nOjin and to the repute thus earned by Japan abroad. Without\r\naltogether questioning that theory, it may be pointed out that much\r\nprobably depended on the conditions existing in China herself. Liu\r\nFang, founder of the Han dynasty (202 B.C.), inaugurated the system\r\nof competitive examinations for civil appointments, and his\r\nsuccessors, Wen-Ti, Wu-Ti, and Kwang-wu, \"developed literature,\r\ncommerce, arts, and good government to a degree unknown before\r\nanywhere in Asia.\" It was Wu-Ti (140-86 B.C.) who conquered Korea,\r\nand unquestionably the Koreans then received many object lessons in\r\ncivilization. The Han dynasty fell in A.D. 190, and there ensued one\r\nof the most troubled periods of Chinese history. Many fugitives from\r\nthe evils of that epoch probably made their way to Korea and even to\r\nJapan. Then followed the after-Han dynasty (A.D. 211-265) when China\r\nwas divided into three principalities; one of which, since it ruled\r\nthe littoral regions directly opposite to Japan, represented China in\r\nJapanese eyes, and its name, Wu, came to be synonymous with China in\r\nJapanese years.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in the days of the Tsin dynasty (A.D. 265-317) and\r\nin those of the Eastern Tsin (A.D. 317-420) that under the pressure\r\nof the Hun inroads and of domestic commotions, numbers of emigrants\r\nfound their way from China to Korea and thence to Japan. The Eastern\r\nTsin occupied virtually the same regions as those held by the Wu\r\ndynasty: they, too, had their capital at Nanking, having moved\r\nthither from Loh-yang, and thus the name Wu was perpetuated for the\r\nJapanese. In the year A.D. 283, according to Japanese chronology,\r\nKoreans and Chinese skilled in useful arts began to immigrate to\r\nJapan. The first to come was a girl called Maketsu. She is said to\r\nhave been sent by the monarch of Kudara, the region corresponding to\r\nthe metropolitan province of modern Korea. It may be inferred that\r\nshe was Chinese, but as to her nationality history is silent. She\r\nsettled permanently in Japan, and her descendants were known as the\r\nkinu-nui (silk-clothiers) of Kume in Yamato. In the same year (A.D.\r\n283), Yuzu (called Yutsuki by some authorities), a Chinese Imperial\r\nprince, came from Korea and memorialized the Yamato Throne in the\r\nsense that he was a descendant of the first Tsin sovereign and that,\r\nhaving migrated to Korea at the head of the inhabitants of 120\r\ndistricts, he had desired to conduct them to Japan, but was unable to\r\naccomplish his purpose owing to obstruction offered by the people of\r\nSinra (Shiragi). Ojin sent two embassies--the second accompanied by\r\ntroops--to procure the release of these people, and in A.D. 285 they\r\nreached Japan, where they received a hearty welcome, and for the sake\r\nof their skill in sericulture and silk weaving, they were honoured by\r\norganization into an uji--Hata-uji (hata in modern Japanese signifies\r\n\"loom,\" but in ancient days it designated silk fabrics of all kinds).\r\n\r\nAn idea of the dimensions of this Chinese addition to the population\r\nof Japan is furnished by the fact that, 175 years later, the Hata-uji\r\nhaving been dispersed and reduced to ninety-two groups, steps were\r\ntaken to reassemble and reorganize them, with the result that 18,670\r\npersons were brought together. Again, in A.D. 289, a sometime subject\r\nof the after-Han dynasty, accompanied by his son, emigrated to Japan.\r\nThe names of these Chinese are given as Achi and Tsuka, and the\r\nformer is described as a great-grandson of the Emperor Ling of the\r\nafter-Han dynasty, who reigned from A.D. 168 to 190. Like Yuzu he had\r\nescaped to Korea during the troublous time at the close of the Han\r\nsway, and, like Yuzu, he had been followed to the peninsula by a\r\nlarge body of Chinese, who, at his request, were subsequently\r\nescorted by Japanese envoys to Japan. These immigrants also were\r\nallowed to assume the status of an uji, and in the fifth century the\r\ntitle of Aya no atae (suzerain of Aya) was given to Achi's\r\ndescendants in consideration of the skill of their followers in\r\ndesigning and manufacturing figured fabrics (for which the general\r\nterm was aya).\r\n\r\nWhen Achi had resided seventeen years in Japan, he and his son were\r\nsent to Wu (China) for the purpose of engaging women versed in making\r\ndress materials. The title of omi (chief ambassador) seems to have\r\nbeen then conferred on the two men, as envoys sent abroad were\r\nhabitually so designated. They did not attempt to go by sea. The\r\nstate of navigation was still such that ocean-going voyages were not\r\nseriously thought of. Achi and his son proceeded in the first\r\ninstance to Koma (the modern Pyong-yang) and there obtained guides\r\nfor the overland journey round the shore of the Gulf of Pechili. They\r\nare said to have made their way to Loh-yang where the Tsin sovereigns\r\nthen had their capital (A.D. 306). Four women were given to them,\r\nwhom they carried back to Japan, there to become the ancestresses of\r\nan uji known as Kure no kinu-nui and Kaya no kinu-nui (clothiers of\r\nKure and of Kaya), appellations which imply Korean origin, but were\r\nprobably suggested by the fact that Korea had been the last\r\ncontinental station on their route. The journey to and from Loh-yang\r\noccupied four years. This page of history shows not only the\r\nbeginning of Japan's useful intercourse with foreign countries, but\r\nalso her readiness to learn what they had to teach and her liberal\r\ntreatment of alien settlers.\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF WRITING\r\n\r\nIt is not infrequently stated that a knowledge of Chinese ideographs\r\nwas acquired by the Japanese for the first time during the reign of\r\nOjin. The basis of this belief are that, in A.D. 284, according to\r\nthe Japanese chronology--a date to which must be added two sexagenary\r\ncycles, bringing it to A.D. 404--the King of Kudara sent two fine\r\nhorses to the Yamato sovereign, and the man who accompanied them,\r\nAtogi by name, showed himself a competent reader of the Chinese\r\nclassics and was appointed tutor to the Prince Imperial. By Atogi's\r\nadvice a still abler scholar, Wani (Wang-in), was subsequently\r\ninvited from Kudara to take Atogi's place, and it is added that the\r\nlatter received the title of fumi-bito (scribe), which he transmitted\r\nto his descendants in Japan. But close scrutiny does not support the\r\ninference that Chinese script had remained unknown to Japan until the\r\nabove incidents. What is proved is merely that the Chinese classics\r\nthen for the first time became an open book in Japan.\r\n\r\nAs for the ideographs themselves, they must have been long familiar,\r\nthough doubtless to a very limited circle. Chinese history affords\r\nconclusive evidence. Thus, in the records of the later Han (A.D.\r\n25-220) we read that from the time when Wu-Ti (140-86 B.C.) overthrew\r\nKorea, the Japanese of thirty-two provinces communicated with the\r\nChinese authorities in the peninsula by means of a postal service.\r\nThe Wei annals (A.D. 220-265) state that in A.D. 238, the Chinese\r\nsovereign sent a written reply to a communication from the \"Queen of\r\nJapan\"--Jingo was then on the throne. In the same year, the Japanese\r\nCourt addressed a written answer to a Chinese rescript forwarded to\r\nYamato by the governor of Thepang--the modern Namwon in Chollado--and\r\nin A.D. 247, a despatch was sent by the Chinese authorities\r\nadmonishing the Japanese to desist from internecine quarrels. These\r\nreferences indicate that the use of the ideographs was known in Japan\r\nlong before the reign of Ojin, whether we take the Japanese or the\r\ncorrected date for the latter. It will probably be just to assume,\r\nhowever, that the study of the ideographs had scarcely any vogue in\r\nJapan until the coming of Atogi and Wani, nor does it appear to have\r\nattracted much attention outside Court circles even subsequently to\r\nthat date, for the records show that, in the reign of the Emperor\r\nBidatsu (A.D. 572-585), a memorial sent by Korea to the Yamato Court\r\nwas illegible to all the officials except one man, by name\r\nWang-sin-i, who seems to have been a descendant of the Paikche\r\nemigrant, Wan-i.\r\n\r\nBuddhism, introduced into Japan in A.D. 552, doubtless supplied the\r\nchief incentive to the acquisition of knowledge. But had the Japanese\r\na script of their own at any period of their history? The two oldest\r\nmanuscripts which contain a reference to this subject are the\r\nKogo-shui, compiled by Hironari in A.D. 808, and a memorial (kammori)\r\npresented to the Throne in A.D. 901 by Miyoshi Kiyotsura. Both\r\nexplicitly state that in remote antiquity there were no letters, and\r\nthat all events or discourses had to be transmitted orally. Not until\r\nthe thirteenth century does the theory of a purely Japanese script\r\nseem to have been conceived, and its author* had no basis for the\r\nhypothesis other than the idea that, as divination was practised in\r\nthe age of the Kami, letters of some kind must have been in use.\r\nSince then the matter has been much discussed. Caves used in ancient\r\ntimes as habitations or sepulchres and old shrines occasionally offer\r\nevidence in the form of symbols which, since they bear some\r\nresemblance to the letters of the Korean alphabet (onmuri), have been\r\nimagined to be at once the origin of the latter and the script of the\r\nKami-no-yo (Age of the Kami). But such fancies are no longer\r\nseriously entertained. It is agreed that the so-called \"letters\" are\r\nnothing more than copies of marks produced by the action of fire upon\r\nbones used in divination. The Japanese cleverly adapted the Chinese\r\nideographs to syllabic purposes, but they never devised a script of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n*Kanekata, who wrote the Shaku Nihongi in the era 1264--1274.\r\n\r\nETHICAL EFFECTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF CHINESE LITERATURE\r\n\r\nA generally accepted belief is that the study of the Chinese classics\r\nexercised a marked ethical influence upon the Japanese nation. That\r\nis a conclusion which may be profitably contrasted with the views of\r\nJapan's most distinguished historians. Mr. Abe Kozo says:\r\n\"Acquaintance with the Chinese classics may be supposed to have\r\nproduced a considerable moral effect on the people of Japan. Nothing\r\nof the kind seems to have been the case. The practical civilization\r\nof China was accepted, but not her ethical code. For any palpable\r\nmoral influence the arrival of Buddhism had to be awaited. Already\r\nthe principles of loyalty and obedience, propriety, and righteousness\r\nwere recognized in Japan though not embodied in any written code.\"\r\nDr. Ariga writes: \"Our countrymen did not acquire anything specially\r\nnew in the way of moral tenets. They must have been surprised to find\r\nthat in China men did not respect the occupants of the throne. A\r\nsubject might murder his sovereign and succeed him without incurring\r\nthe odium of the people.\" Rai Sanyo says: \"Moral principles are like\r\nthe sun and the moon; they cannot be monopolized by any one country.\r\nIn every land there are parents and children, rulers and ruled,\r\nhusbands and wives. Where these relations exist, there also filial\r\npiety and affection, loyalty and righteousness may naturally be\r\nfound. In our country we lack the precise terminology of the\r\nclassics, but it does not follow that we lack the principles\r\nexpressed. What the Japanese acquired from the classics was the\r\nmethod of formulating the thought, not the thought itself.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTEENTH SOVEREIGN, NINTOKU (A.D. 313-399)\r\n\r\nThis sovereign is represented by the Chronicles as having reigned\r\neighty-six years, and by the Records as having died at the age of\r\neighty-three. The same Chronicles make him the lover of a girl whom\r\nhis father, also her lover, generously ceded to him. This event\r\nhappened in A.D. 282. Assuming that Nintoku was then sixteen, he\r\ncannot have been less than 133 at the time of his death. It is thus\r\nseen that the chronology of this period, also, is untrustworthy.\r\nNintoku's reign is remembered chiefly on account of the strange\r\ncircumstances in which he came to the throne, his benevolent charity,\r\nand the slights he suffered at the hands of a jealous consort. His\r\nfather, Ojin, by an exercise of caprice not uncommon on the part of\r\nJapan's ancient sovereigns, had nominated a younger son,\r\nWaka-iratsuko, to be his heir. But this prince showed invincible\r\nreluctance to assume the sceptre after Ojin's death. He asserted\r\nhimself stoutly by killing one of his elder brothers who conspired\r\nagainst him, though he resolutely declined to take precedence of the\r\nother brother, and the latter, proving equally diffident, the throne\r\nremained unoccupied for three years when Waka-iratsuko solved the\r\nproblem by committing suicide.\r\n\r\nSuch are the simplest outlines of the story. But its details, when\r\nfilled in by critical Japanese historians of later ages, suggest a\r\ndifferent impression. When Ojin died his eldest two sons were living\r\nrespectively in Naniwa (Osaka) and Yamato, and the Crown Prince,\r\nWaka-iratsuko, was at Uji. They were thus excellently situated for\r\nsetting up independent claims. From the time of Nintoku's birth, the\r\nprime minister, head of the great Takenouchi family, had taken a\r\nspecial interest in the child, and when the lad grew up he married\r\nthis Takenouchi's granddaughter, who became the mother of three\r\nEmperors. Presently the representatives of all branches of the\r\nTakenouchi family came into possession of influential positions at\r\nCourt, among others that of o-omi, so that in this reign were laid\r\nthe foundations of the controlling power subsequently vested in the\r\nhands of the Heguri, Katsuragi, and Soga houses. In short, this epoch\r\nsaw the beginning of a state of affairs destined to leave its mark\r\npermanently on Japanese history, the relegation of the sovereign to\r\nthe place of a fainéant and the usurpation of the administrative\r\nauthority by a group of great nobles.\r\n\r\nNintoku had the active support of the Takenouchi magnates, and\r\nalthough the Crown Prince may have desired to assert the title\r\nconferred on him by his father, he found himself helpless in the face\r\nof obstructions offered by the prime minister and his numerous\r\npartisans. These suffered him to deal effectively with that one of\r\nhis elder brothers who did not find a place in their ambitious\r\ndesigns, but they created for Waka-iratsuko a situation so\r\nintolerable that suicide became his only resource. Nintoku's first\r\nact on ascending the throne explains the ideographs chosen for his\r\nposthumous name by the authors of the Chronicles, since nin signifies\r\n\"benevolence\" and toku, \"virtue.\" He made Naniwa (Osaka) his capital,\r\nbut instead of levying taxes and requisitioning forced labour to\r\nbuild his palace of Takatsu, he remitted all such burdens for three\r\nyears on observing from a tower that no smoke ascended from the roofs\r\nof the houses and construing this to indicate a state of poverty.\r\nDuring those three years the palace fell into a condition of\r\npractical ruin, and tradition describes its inmates as being\r\ncompelled to move from room to room to avoid the leaking rain.*\r\n\r\n*Doubts have been thrown on the reality of this incident because a\r\npoem, attributed to Nintoku on the occasion, is couched in obviously\r\nanachronistic language. But the poem does not appear in either the\r\nRecords or the Chronicles: it was evidently an invention of later\r\nages.\r\n\r\nUnder Nintoku's sway riparian works and irrigation improvements took\r\nplace on a large scale, and thus the eminent historian, Rai Sanyo,\r\nmay not be without warrant for attributing to this ruler the\r\nsentiment quoted in the Chronicles: \"A sovereign lives for his\r\npeople. Their prosperity is his enrichment; their poverty, his loss.\"\r\nYet it is in connexion with Nintoku's repairs of the Manda river-bank\r\nthat we find the first mention of a heinous custom occasionally\r\npractised in subsequent ages--the custom of sacrificing human life to\r\nexpedite the progress or secure the success of some public work.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, that habits indicating a higher civilization had\r\nalready begun to gain ground is proved by an incident which occurred\r\nto one of the Imperial princes during a hunting expedition. Looking\r\ndown over a moor from a mountain, he observed a pit, and, on inquiry,\r\nwas informed by the local headman that it was an \"ice-pit.\" The\r\nprince, asking how the ice was stored and for what it was used,\r\nreceived this answer: \"The ground is excavated to a depth of over ten\r\nfeet. The top is then covered with a roof of thatch. A thick layer of\r\nreed-grass is then spread, upon which the ice is laid. The months of\r\nsummer have passed and yet it is not melted. As to its use--when the\r\nhot months come it is placed in water or sake and thus used.\"\r\n[Aston's Nihongi.] Thenceforth the custom of storing ice was adopted\r\nat the Court. It was in Nintoku's era that the pastime of hawking,\r\nafterward widely practised, became known for the first time in Japan.\r\nKorea was the place of origin, and it is recorded that the falcon had\r\na soft leather strap fastened to one leg and a small bell to the\r\ntail. Pheasants were the quarry of the first hawk flown on the moor\r\nof Mozu.\r\n\r\nLight is also thrown in Nintoku's annals on the method of\r\nboatbuilding practised by the Japanese in the fourth century. They\r\nused dug-outs. The provincial governor* of Totomi is represented as\r\nreporting that a huge tree had floated down the river Oi and had\r\nstopped at a bend. It was a single stem forked at one end, and the\r\nsuzerain of Yamato was ordered to make a boat of it. The craft was\r\nthen brought round by sea to Naniwa, \"where it was enrolled among the\r\nImperial vessels.\" Evidently from the days of Ojin and the Karano a\r\nfleet formed part of the Imperial possessions. This two-forked boat\r\nfigures in the reign of Nintoku's successor, Richu, when the latter\r\nand his concubine went on board and feasted separately, each in one\r\nfork.\r\n\r\n*This term, \"provincial governor,\" appears now for the first time\r\nwritten with the ideographs \"kokushi.\" Hitherto it has been written\r\n\"kuni-no-miyatsuko.\" Much is heard of the koushi in later times. They\r\nare the embryo of the daimyo, the central figures of military\r\nfeudalism.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY OF TAKENOUCHI-NO-SUKUNE\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding of Japanese history at this stage, a\r\nword must be said about a family of nobles (sukune) who, from the\r\ndays of Nintoku, exercised potent sway in the councils of State.\r\nIt will have been observed that, in the annals of the Emperor\r\nKeiko's reign, prominence is given to an official designated\r\nTakenouchi-no-Sukune, who thereafter seems to have served sovereign\r\nafter sovereign until his death in the year 368, when he must have\r\nbeen from two hundred to three hundred years old. This chronological\r\ndifficulty has provoked much scepticism. Dr. Kume, an eminent\r\nJapanese historian, explains, however, that Takenouchi was the name\r\nnot of a person but of a family, and that it was borne by different\r\nscions in succeeding reigns. The first was a grandson of the Emperor\r\nKogen (B.C. 214-158), and the representatives of the family in\r\nNintoku's era had seven sons, all possessing the title sukune. They\r\nwere Hata no Yashiro, Koze no Ogara, Soga no Ishikawa, Heguri no\r\nTsuku, Ki no Tsunu, Katsuragi no Sotsu, and Wakugo.\r\n\r\nFrom these were descended the five uji of Koze, Soga, Heguri, Ki, and\r\nKatsuragi. Although its founder was an Emperor's grandson and\r\ntherefore entitled to be called \"Imperial Prince\" (O), the family\r\nconnexion with the Throne naturally became more remote as time\r\npassed, and from the reign of Ojin we find its members classed among\r\nsubjects. Nevertheless, the Empress Iwa, whose jealousy harrassed\r\nNintoku so greatly, was a daughter of Katsuragi no Sotsu, and, as\r\nwith the sole exception of the Emperor Shomu, every occupant of the\r\nthrone had taken for his Empress a lady of Imperial blood, it may be\r\nassumed that the relationship between the Imperial and the Takenouchi\r\nfamilies was recognized at that time. The roles which the five uji\r\nmentioned above acted in subsequent history deserve to be studied,\r\nand will therefore be briefly set down here.\r\n\r\nTHE KOZE-UJI\r\n\r\nThis uji had for founder Koze no Ogara. The representative of the\r\nfourth generation, Koze no Ohito, held the post of o-omi during the\r\nreign of the Emperor Keitai (A.D. 507-531), and his great-grandson\r\nwas minister of the Left under Kotoku (A.D. 545-654). Thereafter, the\r\nheads of the uji occupied prominent positions under successive\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nTHE SOGA-UJI\r\n\r\nSoga no Ishikawa founded this uji. His son, Machi, shared the\r\nadministrative power with Heguri no Tsuku in the reign of Richu (A.D.\r\n400-405), and Machi's great-grandson, Iname, immortalized himself by\r\npromoting the introduction of Buddhism in the reign of Kimmei (A.D.\r\n540-571). Iname's son, Umako, and the latter's son, Yemishi, will be\r\nmuch heard of hereafter. No family, indeed, affected the course of\r\nJapanese history in early days more than did the Soga-uji.\r\n\r\nTHE HEGURI-UJI\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the Emperor Richu (A.D. 400-405), Heguri no\r\nTsuku, founder of this uji, shared in the administration with Soga no\r\nMachi. His son, Heguri no Matori, was minister under Yuryaku (A.D.\r\n457-459), and the fate which he and his son, Shibi, brought upon\r\ntheir family is one of the salient incidents of Japanese history.\r\n\r\nTHE KI-UJI\r\n\r\nThe representatives of this uji, from the days of its founder, Ki\r\nno Tsunu, took a prominent share in the empire's foreign affairs,\r\nbut served also in the capacity of provincial governor and\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nTHE KATSURAGI-UJI\r\n\r\nNintoku's Empress, Iwa, was a daughter of the ancestor of this uji,\r\nKatsuragi no Sotsu, and the latter's great-granddaughter, Hae, was\r\nthe mother of two sovereigns, Kenso (A.D. 485-487) and Ninken (A.D.\r\n488-498).\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TOBACCO PIPE AND POUCH\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HINOMI YAGURA (FIRE WATCH TOWER)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PROTOHISTORIC SOVEREIGNS\r\n\r\nThe 17th Sovereign, Richu    A.D. 400-405\r\n\r\n\"   18th    \"       Hansho    \"   406-411\r\n\r\n\"   19th    \"       Inkyo     \"   412-453\r\n\r\n\"   20th    \"       Anko      \"   454-456\r\n\r\n\"   21st    \"       Yuryaku   \"   457-479\r\n\r\nRICHU'S REIGN\r\n\r\nTHE prehistoric era may be said to terminate with the accession of\r\nRichu. Thenceforth the lives and reigns of successive sovereigns\r\ncease to extend to incredible lengths, and though the chronology\r\nadopted by the writers of the Nihongi may not yet be implicitly\r\naccepted, its general accuracy is not open to dispute. The era of the\r\nfive sovereigns standing at the head of this chapter--an era of\r\nfifty-nine years--inherited as legacies from the immediate past: a\r\nwell-furnished treasury, a nation in the enjoyment of peace, a firmly\r\nestablished throne, and a satisfactory state of foreign relations.\r\nThese comfortable conditions seem to have exercised demoralizing\r\ninfluence. The bonds of discipline grew slack; fierce quarrels on\r\naccount of women involved fratricide among the princes of the blood,\r\nand finally the life of an Emperor was sacrificed--the only instance\r\nof such a catastrophe in Japanese history.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Nintoku's death this evil state of affairs was\r\ninaugurated by Prince Nakatsu, younger brother of the heir to the\r\nthrone, who had not yet assumed the sceptre. Sent by the Crown Prince\r\n(Richu) to make arrangements for the latter's nuptials with the lady\r\nKuro, a daughter of the Takenouchi family, Nakatsu personified Richu,\r\ndebauched the girl, and to avoid the consequences of the act, sought\r\nto take the life of the man he had betrayed. It does not redound to\r\nthe credit of the era that the debaucher found support and was\r\nenabled to hold his own for a time, though his treachery ultimately\r\nmet with its merited fate. At this crisis of his life, Richu received\r\nloyal assistance from a younger brother, and his gratitude induced\r\nhim to confer on the latter the title of Crown Prince. In thus\r\nacting, Richu may have been influenced by the fact that the\r\nalternative was to bequeath the throne to a baby, but none the less\r\nhe stands responsible for an innovation which greatly impaired the\r\nstability of the succession. It should be noted, as illustrating the\r\ninfluence of the Takenouchi family that, in spite of the shame she\r\nhad suffered, the lady Kuro became the Emperor's concubine. In fact,\r\namong the four nobles who administered the affairs of the empire\r\nduring Richu's reign, not the least powerful were Heguri no Tsuku and\r\nSoga no Machi. Moreover, Richu, as has been stated already, was a son\r\nof Iwa, a lady of the same great family, and his two successors,\r\nHansho and Inkyo, were his brothers by the same mother.\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nThe annals of Richu's reign confirm a principle which received its\r\nfirst illustration when the Emperor Keiko put to death for parricide\r\nthe daughter of a Kumaso chief, though she had betrayed her father in\r\nthe interest of Keiko himself. Similar deference to the spirit of\r\nloyalty led to the execution of Sashihire in the time of Richu. A\r\nretainer of the rebellious Prince Nakatsu, Sashihire, assassinated\r\nthat prince at the instance of Prince Mizuha, who promised large\r\nreward. But after the deed had been accomplished, Heguri no Tsuku\r\nadvised his nephew, Mizuha, saying, \"Sashihire has killed his own\r\nlord for the sake of another, and although for us he has done a great\r\nservice, yet towards his own lord his conduct has been heartless in\r\nthe extreme.\" Sashihire was therefore put to death. That this\r\nprinciple was always observed in Japan cannot be asserted, but that\r\nit was always respected is certain.\r\n\r\nIn Richu's reign there is found the first clear proof that tattooing\r\nwas not practised in Japan for ornamental purposes. Tattooing is\r\nfirst mentioned as a custom of the Yemishi when their country was\r\ninspected by Takenouchi at Keiko's orders. But in Richu's time it was\r\nemployed to punish the muraji of Atsumi, who had joined the rebellion\r\nof Prince Nakatsu. He was \"inked\" on the face. It appears also that\r\nthe same practice had hitherto been employed to distinguish\r\nhorse-keepers, but the custom was finally abandoned in deference to\r\nan alleged revelation from Izanagi, the deity of Awaji, on the\r\noccasion of a visit by Richu to that island. In the context of this\r\nrevelation it is noticeable that belief in the malign influence of\r\noffended deities was gaining ground. Thus, on the occasion of the\r\nsudden death of Princess Kuro, the voice of the wind was heard to\r\nutter mysterious words in the \"great void\" immediately before the\r\ncoming of a messenger to announce the event, and the Emperor\r\nattributed the calamity to the misconduct of an official who had\r\nremoved certain persons from serving at a shrine.\r\n\r\nThe annals of this reign are noteworthy as containing the earliest\r\nreference to the compilation of books. It is stated that in the year\r\nA.D. 403 \"local recorders were appointed for the first time in the\r\nvarious provinces, who noted down statements and communicated the\r\nwritings of the four quarters.\" An eminent critic--Mr. W. G.\r\nAston--regards this as an anachronism, since the coming of the Korean\r\nscholar, Wani (vide sup.), did not take place until the year 405,\r\nwhich date probably preceded by many years the appointment of\r\nrecorders. But it has been shown above that the innovation due to\r\nWani was, not the art of writing, but, in all probability, a\r\nknowledge of the Chinese classics.\r\n\r\nAnother institution established during this era was a treasury (A.D.\r\n405), and the two learned Koreans who had come from Paikche (Kudara)\r\nwere appointed to keep the accounts. A work of later date than the\r\nChronicles or Records--the Shokuin-rei--says that in this treasury\r\nwere stored \"gold and silver, jewels, precious utensils, brocade and\r\nsatin, saicenet, rugs and mattresses, and the rare objects sent as\r\ntribute by the various barbarians.\"\r\n\r\nHANSHO\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Hansho's short reign of five years is not remarkable for\r\nanything except an indirect evidence that Chinese customs were\r\nbeginning to be adopted at the Japanese Court. In the earliest eras,\r\nthe ladies who enjoyed the sovereign's favour were classed simply as\r\n\"Empress\" or \"consort.\" But from the days of Hansho we find three\r\nranks of concubines.\r\n\r\nINKYO\r\n\r\nInkyo was a younger brother of his predecessor, Hansho, as the latter\r\nhad been of Richu. No formal nomination of Inkyo as Prince Imperial\r\nhad taken place, and thus for the first time the sceptre was found\r\nwithout any legalized heir or any son of the deceased sovereign to\r\ntake it. In these circumstances, the ministers held a council and\r\nagreed to offer the throne to Inkyo, the elder of two surviving sons\r\nof Nintoku. Inkyo was suffering from a disease supposed to be\r\nincurable, and, distrusting his own competence, he persistently\r\nrefused to accept the responsibility. The incident responsible for\r\nhis ultimate consent was the intervention of a concubine, Onakatsu,\r\nafterwards Empress. Under pretext of carrying water for the prince\r\nshe entered his chamber, and when he turned his back on her entreaty\r\nthat he would comply with the ministers' desire, she remained\r\nstanding in the bitter cold of a stormy day of January, until the\r\nwater, which she had spilled over her arm, became frozen and she fell\r\nin a faint. Then the prince yielded. A year later envoys were sent to\r\nseek medical assistance in Korea, which was evidently regarded as the\r\nhome of the healing science as well as of many other arts borrowed\r\nfrom China. A physician arrived from Sinra, and Inkyo's malady was\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nIn this reign took place a celebrated incident, already referred to,\r\nwhen the lineage of the nobles was corrected by recourse to the\r\nordeal of boiling water. But a much larger space in the annals is\r\noccupied with the story of an affair, important only as illustrating\r\nthe manners and customs of the time. From an early period it had been\r\nusual that Japanese ladies on festive occasions should go through the\r\ngraceful performance of \"woven paces and waving hands,\" which\r\nconstituted dancing, and, in the era now occupying our attention,\r\nthere prevailed in the highest circles a custom that the danseuse\r\nshould offer a maiden to the most honoured among the guests. One\r\nwinter's day, at the opening of a new palace, the Empress Onakatsu\r\ndanced to the music of the Emperor's lute. Onakatsu had a younger\r\nsister, Oto, of extraordinary beauty, and the Emperor, fain to\r\npossess the girl but fearful of offending the Empress, had planned\r\nthis dance so that Onakatsu, in compliance with the recognized usage,\r\nmight be constrained to place her sister at his disposal. It fell out\r\nas Inkyo wished, but there then ensued a chapter of incidents in\r\nwhich the dignity of the Crown fared ill. Again and again the\r\nbeautiful Oto refused to obey her sovereign's summons, and when at\r\nlength, by an unworthy ruse, she was induced to repair to the palace,\r\nit was found impossible to make her an inmate of it in defiance of\r\nthe Empress' jealousy. She had to be housed elsewhere, and still the\r\nImperial lover was baffled, for he dared not brave the elder sister's\r\nresentment by visiting the younger. Finally he took advantage of the\r\nEmpress' confinement to pay the long-deferred visit, but, on learning\r\nof the event, the outraged wife set fire to the parturition house and\r\nattempted to commit suicide. \"Many years have passed,\" she is\r\nrecorded to have said to the Emperor, \"since I first bound up my hair\r\nand became thy companion in the inner palace. It is too cruel of\r\nthee, O Emperor! Wherefore just on this night when I am in childbirth\r\nand hanging between life and death, must thou go to Fujiwara?\" Inkyo\r\nhad the grace to be \"greatly shocked\" and to \"soothe the mind of the\r\nEmpress with explanations,\" but he did not mend his infidelity. At\r\nOto's request he built a residence for her at Chinu in the\r\nneighbouring province of Kawachi, and thereafter the compilers of the\r\nChronicles, with fine irony, confine their record of three\r\nconsecutive years' events to a repetition of the single phrase, \"the\r\nEmperor made a progress to Chinu.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, extravagant to surmise that the publicity\r\nattending this sovereign's amours and the atmosphere of loose\r\nmorality thus created were in part responsible for a crime committed\r\nby his elder son, the Crown Prince Karu. Marriage between children of\r\nthe same father had always been permitted in Japan provided the\r\nmother was different, but marriage between children of the same\r\nmother was incest. Prince Karu was guilty of this offence with his\r\nsister, Oiratsume, and so severely did the nation judge him that he\r\nwas driven into exile and finally obliged to commit suicide. With\r\nsuch records is the reign of Inkyo associated. It is perplexing that\r\nthe posthumous name chosen for him by historians should signify\r\n\"sincerely courteous.\" Incidentally, four facts present\r\nthemselves--that men wore wristbands and garters to which grelots\r\nwere attached; that a high value was set on pearls; that metal was\r\nused for the construction of great men's gates, and that the first\r\nearthquake is said to have been experienced in A.D. 416.\r\n\r\nANKO\r\n\r\nThe records of this sovereign's reign make a discreditable page of\r\nJapanese history. Anko, having ascended the throne after an armed\r\ncontest with his elder brother, which ended in the latter's suicide,\r\ndesired to arrange a marriage between his younger brother, Ohatsuse,\r\nand a sister of his uncle, Okusaka. He despatched Ne no Omi, a\r\ntrusted envoy, to confer with the latter, who gladly consented, and,\r\nin token of approval, handed to Ne no Omi a richly jewelled coronet\r\nfor conveyance to the Emperor. But Ne no Omi, covetous of the gems,\r\nsecreted the coronet, and told the Emperor that Okusaka had rejected\r\nthe proposal with scorn. Anko took no steps to investigate the truth\r\nof this statement. It has been already seen that such investigations\r\nwere not customary in those days. Soldiers were at once sent to\r\nslaughter Okusaka; his wife, Nakashi, was taken to be the Emperor's\r\nconsort, and his sister, Hatahi, was married to Prince Ohatsuse.\r\n\r\nNow, at the time of his death, Okusaka had a son, Mayuwa, seven years\r\nold. One day, the Emperor, having drunk heavily, confessed to the\r\nEmpress, Nakashi, that he entertained some apprehension lest this boy\r\nmight one day seek to avenge his father's execution. The child\r\noverheard this remark, and creeping to the side of his step-father,\r\nwho lay asleep with his head in Nakashi's lap, killed him with his\r\nown sword. Such is the tale narrated in the Chronicles and the\r\nRecords. But its incredible features are salient. A deed of the kind\r\nwould never have been conceived or committed by a child, and the\r\nEmpress must have been a conniving party.\r\n\r\nTo what quarter, then, is the instigation to be traced? An answer\r\nseems to be furnished by the conduct of Prince Ohatsuse. Between this\r\nprince and the throne five lives intervened; those of the Emperor\r\nAnko, of the latter's two brothers, Yatsuri no Shiro and Sakai no\r\nKuro, both older than Ohatsuse, and of two sons of the late Emperor\r\nRichu, Ichinobe no Oshiwa and Mima. Every one of these was removed\r\nfrom the scene in the space of a few days. Immediately after Anko's\r\nassassination, Ohatsuse, simulating suspicion of his two elder\r\nbrothers, killed the o-omi, who refused to give them up. Ohatsuse\r\nthen turned his attention to his grand-uncles, the two sons of Richu.\r\nHe sent a military force to destroy one of them without any pretence\r\nof cause; the other he invited to a hunting expedition and\r\ntreacherously shot. If Ohatsuse did not contrive the murder of Anko,\r\nas he contrived the deaths of all others standing between himself and\r\nthe throne, a great injustice has been done to his memory.\r\n\r\nLOYALTY\r\n\r\nThese shocking incidents are not without a relieving feature. They\r\nfurnished opportunities for the display of fine devotion. When Prince\r\nOkusaka died for a crime of which he was wholly innocent, two of his\r\nretainers, Naniwa no Hikaga, father and son, committed suicide in\r\nvindication of his memory. When Prince Sakai no Kuro and Mayuwa took\r\nrefuge in the house of the o-omi Tsubura, the latter deliberately\r\nchose death rather than surrender the fugitives. When Prince Kuro\r\nperished, Nie-no-Sukune took the corpse in his arms and was burned\r\nwith it. When Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa fell under the treacherous\r\narrow of Prince Ohatsuse, one of the former's servants embraced the\r\ndead body and fell into such a paroxysm of grief that Ohatsuse\r\nordered him to be despatched. And during this reign of Yuryaku, when\r\nLord Otomo was killed in a fatal engagement with the Sinra troops, his\r\nhenchman, Tsumaro, crying, \"My master has fallen; what avails that I\r\nalone should remain unhurt?\" threw himself into the ranks of the\r\nenemy and perished. Loyalty to the death characterized the Japanese\r\nin every age.\r\n\r\nYURYAKU\r\n\r\nThis sovereign was the Ohatsuse of whose unscrupulous ambition so\r\nmuch has just been heard. Some historians have described him as an\r\naustere man, but few readers of his annals will be disposed to\r\nendorse such a lenient verdict. He ordered that a girl, whose only\r\nfault was misplaced affection, should have her four limbs stretched\r\non a tree and be roasted to death; he slew one of his stewards at a\r\nhunt, because the man did not understand how to cut up the meat of an\r\nanimal; he removed a high official--Tasa, omi of Kibi--to a distant\r\npost in order to possess himself of the man's wife (Waka), and he\r\narbitrarily and capriciously killed so many men and women that the\r\npeople called him the \"Emperor of great wickedness.\" One act of\r\njustice stands to his credit. The slanderer, Ne no Omi, who for the\r\nsake of a jewelled coronet had caused the death of Prince Okusaka, as\r\nrelated above, had the temerity to wear the coronet, sixteen years\r\nsubsequently, when he presided at a banquet given in honour of envoys\r\nfrom China; and the beauty of the bauble having thus been noised\r\nabroad, Ne no Omi was required to show it at the palace. It was\r\nimmediately recognized by the Empress, sister of the ill-starred\r\nprince, and Ne no Omi, having confessed his crime, was put to death,\r\nall the members of his uji being reduced to the rank of serfs. One\r\nmoiety of them was formed into a hereditary corporation which was\r\norganized under the name of Okusakabe, in memory of Prince Okusaka.\r\n\r\nARTS AND CRAFTS\r\n\r\nThe reign of Yuryaku is partially saved from the reproach of selfish\r\ndespotism by the encouragement given to the arts and crafts. It has\r\nalready been related that the members of the Hata-uji, which had been\r\nconstituted originally with artisans from China, gradually became\r\ndispersed throughout the provinces and were suffering some hardships\r\nwhen Yuryaku issued orders for their reassembly and reorganization.\r\nSubsequently the sovereign gave much encouragement to sericulture,\r\nand, inspired doubtless by the legend of the Sun goddess, inaugurated\r\na custom which thereafter prevailed in Japan through all ages, the\r\ncultivation of silkworms by the Empress herself. At a later date,\r\nlearning from a Korean handicraftsman (tebito)--whose name has been\r\nhanded down as Kwan-in Chiri--that Korea abounded in experts of\r\nsuperior skill, Yuryaku commissioned this man to carry to the King of\r\nKudara (Paikche) an autograph letter asking for the services of\r\nseveral of these experts. This request was complied with, and the\r\nnewcomers were assigned dwellings at the village of Tsuno in Yamato;*\r\nbut as the place proved unhealthy, they were afterwards distributed\r\namong several localities.\r\n\r\n*There were potters, saddlers, brocade-weavers, and interpreters.\r\n\r\nIt is also recorded that, about this time, there came from China a\r\nman called An Kiko, a descendant of one of the Wu sovereigns. He\r\nsettled in Japan, and his son, Ryu afterwards--named Shinki--is\r\nreputed to have been the first exponent of Chinese pictorial art in\r\nJapan. In the year A.D. 470, there was another arrival of artisans,\r\nthis time from Wu (China), including weavers and clothiers. They\r\nlanded in the province of Settsu, and to commemorate their coming a\r\nroad called the \"Kure-saka\" (Wu acclivity) was constructed from that\r\nport to the Shihatsu highway. The descendants of these immigrants\r\nwere organized into two hereditary corporations (be) of\r\nsilk-clothiers, the Asuka no Kinu-nui-be and the Ise no Kinu-nui-be.\r\nTwo years later (472), orders were issued for the cultivation of\r\nmulberry trees in all suitable provinces, and at the same time the\r\npreviously reassembled members of the Hata-uji were once more\r\ndistributed to various localities with the object of widening their\r\nsphere of instruction.\r\n\r\nIn the year 473 a very interesting event is recorded. The muraji of\r\nthe Hanishi was ordered to furnish craftsmen to manufacture \"pure\r\nutensils\" for serving viands daily in the palace. These Hanishi are\r\nfirst spoken of as having been employed at the suggestion of\r\nNomi-no-Sukune, in the days of the Emperor Suinin (A.D. 3), to make\r\nclay substitutes for the human beings thitherto inhumed at the\r\nsepulchres of notables. In response to this order the muraji summoned\r\nhis own tami-be (private hereditary corporation) then located at\r\nseven villages in the provinces of Settsu, Yamashiro, Ise, Tamba,\r\nTajima, and Inaba. They were organized into the Nie no Hanishibe, or\r\nhereditary corporation of potters of table-utensils. Ceramists had\r\npreviously come from Kudara (Paikche), and there can be no doubt that\r\nsome progress was made in the art from the fifth century onwards. But\r\nthere does not appear to be sufficient ground for a conclusion formed\r\nby some historians that the \"pure utensils\" mentioned above were of\r\nglazed pottery. The art of applying glaze to ceramic manufactures was\r\nnot discovered until a much later period.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH KOREA\r\n\r\nWhen Yuryaku ascended the throne, Japan still enjoyed her original\r\nfriendship with Paikche (Kudara), whence ladies-in-waiting were sent\r\nperiodically to the Yamato Court. She also retained her military post\r\nat Mimana (Imna) and kept a governor there, but her relations with\r\nShiragi (Sinra) were somewhat strained, owing to harsh treatment of\r\nthe latter's special envoys who had come to convey their sovereign's\r\ncondolences on the death of the Emperor Inkyo (453). From the time of\r\nYuryaku's accession, Shiragi ceased altogether to send the usual\r\ngifts to the Emperor of Japan. In the year 463, Yuryaku, desiring to\r\npossess himself of the wife of a high official, Tasa, sent him to be\r\ngovernor of Mimana, and in his absence debauched the lady. Tasa,\r\nlearning how he had been dishonoured, raised the standard of revolt\r\nand sought aid of the Shiragi people. Then Yuryaku, with\r\ncharacteristic refinement of cruelty, ordered Tasa's son, Oto, to\r\nlead a force against his father. Oto seemingly complied, but, on\r\nreaching the peninsula, opened communication with his father, and it\r\nwas agreed that while Tasa should hold Imna, breaking off all\r\nrelations with Japan, Oto should adopt a similar course with regard\r\nto Paikche. This plot was frustrated by Oto's wife, Kusu, a woman too\r\npatriotic to connive at treason in any circumstances. She killed her\r\nhusband, and the Court of Yamato was informed of these events.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, however, Japan's hold upon the peninsula was shaken.\r\nYuryaku sent four expeditions thither, but they accomplished nothing\r\npermanent. The power of Koma in the north increased steadily, and it\r\nhad the support of China. Yuryaku's attempts to establish close\r\nrelations with the latter--the Sung were then on the throne--seem to\r\nhave been inspired by a desire to isolate Korea. He failed, and\r\nultimately Kudara was overrun by Koma, as will be seen by and by. It\r\nis scarcely too much to say that Japan lost her paramount status in\r\nKorea because of Yuryaku's illicit passion for the wife of one of his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe first absolute agreement between the dates given in Japanese\r\nhistory and those given in Korean occurs in this reign, namely, the\r\nyear A.D. 475. The severest critics therefore consent to admit the\r\ntrustworthiness of the Japanese annals from the third quarter of the\r\nfifth century.\r\n\r\nTREASURIES\r\n\r\nIn the record of Richu's reign, brief mention has been made of the\r\nestablishment of a Government treasury. In early days, when religious\r\nrites and administrative functions were not differentiated, articles\r\nneeded for both purposes were kept in the same store, under the\r\ncharge of the Imibe-uji. But as the Court grew richer, owing to\r\nreceipt of domestic taxes and foreign \"tribute,\" the necessity of\r\nestablishing separate treasuries, was felt and a \"domestic store\"\r\n(Uchi-kura) was formed during Richu's reign, the Koreans, Achi and\r\nWani, being appointed to keep the accounts. In Yuryaku's time a third\r\ntreasury had to be added, owing to greatly increased production of\r\ntextile fabrics and other manufactures. This was called the Okura, a\r\nterm still applied to the Imperial treasury, and there were thus\r\nthree stores, Okura, Uchi-kura, and Imi-kura. Soga no Machi was\r\nplaced in supreme charge of all three, and the power of the Soga\r\nfamily grew proportionately.\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nIt is observable that at this epoch the sovereigns of Japan had not\r\nyet begun to affect the sacred seclusion which, in later ages, became\r\ncharacteristic of them. It is true that, after ascending the throne,\r\nthey no longer led their troops in war, though they did so as\r\nImperial princes. But in other respects they lived the lives of\r\nordinary men--joining in the chase, taking part in banquets, and\r\nmixing freely with the people. As illustrating this last fact a\r\nstrange incident may be cited. One day the Emperor Yuryaku visited\r\nthe place where some carpenters were at work and observed that one of\r\nthem, Mane, in shaping timber with an axe, used a stone for ruler but\r\nnever touched it with the axe. \"Dost thou never make a mistake and\r\nstrike the stone?\" asked the monarch. \"I never make a mistake,\"\r\nreplied the carpenter. Then, to disturb the man's sang-froid, Yuryaku\r\ncaused the ladies-in-waiting (uneme) to dance, wearing only\r\nwaist-cloths. Mane watched the spectacle for a while, and on resuming\r\nhis work, his accuracy of aim was momentarily at fault. The Emperor\r\nrebuked him for having made an unwarranted boast and handed him over\r\nto the monono-be for execution. After the unfortunate man had been\r\nled away, one of his comrades chanted an impromptu couplet lamenting\r\nhis fate, whereat the Emperor, relenting, bade a messenger gallop off\r\non \"a black horse of Kai\" to stay the execution. The mandate of mercy\r\narrived just in time, and when Mane's bonds were loosed, he, too,\r\nimprovised a verse:\r\n\r\n   \"Black as the night\r\n   \"Was the horse of Kai.\r\n   \"Had they waited to\r\n   \"Saddle him, my life were lost\r\n   \"O, horse of Kai!\"\r\n\r\nThe whole incident is full of instruction. A sovereign concerning\r\nhimself about trivialities as petty as this pretext on which he sends\r\na man to death; the shameful indignity put upon the ladies-in-waiting\r\nto minister to a momentary whim; the composition of poetry by common\r\ncarpenters, and the ride for life on a horse which there is not time\r\nto saddle. It is an instructive picture of the ways of Yuryaku's\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nIn truth, this couplet-composing proclivity is one of the strangest\r\nfeatures of the Yamato race as portrayed in the pages of the Records\r\nand the Chronicles. From the time when the fierce Kami, Susanoo, put\r\nhis thoughts into verse as he sought for a place to celebrate his\r\nmarriage, great crises and little crises in the careers of men and\r\nwomen respectively inspire couplets. We find an Emperor addressing an\r\node to a dragon-fly which avenges him on a gad-fly; we find a prince\r\nreciting impromptu stanzas while he lays siege to the place whither\r\nhis brother has fled for refuge; we find a heartbroken lady singing a\r\nverselet as for the last time she ties the garters of her lord going\r\nto his death, and we find a sovereign corresponding in verse with his\r\nconsort whose consent to his own dishonour he seeks to win.\r\n\r\nYet in the lives of all these men and women of old, there are not\r\nmany other traces of corresponding refinement or romance. We are\r\nconstrained to conjecture that many of the verses quoted in the\r\nRecords and the Chronicles were fitted in after ages to the events\r\nthey commemorate. Another striking feature in the lives of these\r\nearly sovereigns is that while on the one hand their residences are\r\nspoken of as muro, a term generally applied to dwellings partially\r\nunderground, on the other, we find more than one reference to high\r\ntowers. Thus Yuryaku is shown as \"ordering commissioners to erect a\r\nlofty pavilion in which he assumes the Imperial dignity,\" and the\r\nEmperor Nintoku is represented as \"ascending a lofty tower and\r\nlooking far and wide\" on the occasion of his celebrated sympathy with\r\nthe people's poverty.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ANCIENT ACROBATIC PERFORMANCE\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DAIRISAMA (KINO) AND OKUSAMA (QUEEN) OF THE FEAST OF THE\r\nDOLLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PROTOHISTORIC SOVEREIGNS (Continued)\r\n\r\nThe 22nd Sovereign, Seinei  A.D. 480-484\r\n\r\n \"  23rd    \"       Kenso    \"   485-487\r\n\r\n \"  24th    \"       Ninken   \"   488-498\r\n\r\n \"  25th    \"       Muretsu  \"   499-506\r\n\r\n \"  26th    \"       Keitai   \"   507-531\r\n\r\n \"  27th    \"       Ankan    \"   534-535\r\n\r\n \"  28th    \"       Senkwa   \"   536-539\r\n\r\nDISPUTE ABOUT THE SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nTHE Emperor Yuryaku's evil act in robbing Tasa of his wife, Waka,\r\nentailed serious consequences. He selected to succeed to the throne\r\nhis son Seinei, by Princess Kara, who belonged to the Katsuragi\r\nbranch of the great Takenouchi family. But Princess Waka conspired to\r\nsecure the dignity for the younger of her own two sons, Iwaki and\r\nHoshikawa, who were both older than Seinei. She urged Hoshikawa to\r\nassert his claim by seizing the Imperial treasury, and she herself\r\nwith Prince Iwaki and others accompanied him thither. They\r\nunderestimated the power of the Katsuragi family. Siege was laid to\r\nthe treasury and all its inmates were burned, with the exception of\r\none minor official to whom mercy was extended and who, in token of\r\ngratitude, presented twenty-five acres of rice-land to the o-muraji,\r\nLord Otomo, commander of the investing force.\r\n\r\nTHE FUGITIVE PRINCES\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Seinei had no offspring, and for a time it seemed that\r\nthe succession in the direct line would be interrupted. For this lack\r\nof heirs the responsibility ultimately rested with Yuryaku. In his\r\nfierce ambition to sweep away every obstacle, actual or potential,\r\nthat barred his ascent to the throne, he inveigled Prince Oshiwa,\r\neldest son of the Emperor Richu, to accompany him on a hunting\r\nexpedition, and slew him mercilessly on the moor of Kaya. Oshiwa had\r\ntwo sons, Oke and Woke, mere children at the time of their father's\r\nmurder. They fled, under the care of Omi, a muraji, who, with his\r\nson, Adahiko, secreted them in the remote province of Inaba. Omi\r\nultimately committed suicide in order to avoid the risk of capture\r\nand interrogation under torture, and the two little princes, still\r\naccompanied by Adahiko, calling themselves \"the urchins of Tamba,\"\r\nbecame menials in the service of the obito of the Shijimi granaries\r\nin the province of Harima.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four years had been passed in that seclusion when it chanced\r\nthat Odate, governor of the province, visited the obito on an\r\noccasion when the latter was holding a revel to celebrate the\r\nbuilding of a new house, it fell to the lot of the two princes to act\r\nas torch-bearers, the lowest role that could be assigned to them, and\r\nthe younger counselled his brother that the time had come to declare\r\nthemselves, for death was preferable to such a life. Tradition says\r\nthat, being invited to dance \"when the night had become profound,\r\nwhen the revel was at its height and when every one else had danced\r\nin turn,\" the Prince Woke, accompanying his movements with verses\r\nextemporized for the occasion, danced so gracefully that the governor\r\ntwice asked him to continue, and at length he announced the rank and\r\nlineage of his brother and himself. The governor, astonished, \"made\r\nrepeated obeisance to the youths, built a palace for their temporary\r\naccommodation, and going up to the capital, disclosed the whole\r\naffair to the Emperor, who expressed profound satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nOke, the elder of the two, was made Prince Imperial, and should have\r\nascended the throne on the death of Seinei, a few months later.\r\nArguing, however, that to his younger brother, Woke it was entirely\r\ndue that they had emerged from a state of abject misery, Oke\r\nannounced his determination to cede the honour to Woke, who, in turn,\r\ndeclined to take precedence of his elder brother. This dispute of\r\nmutual deference continued for a whole year, during a part of which\r\ntime the administration was carried on by Princess Awo, elder sister\r\nof Woke. At length the latter yielded and assumed the sceptre. His\r\nfirst care was to collect the bones of his father, Prince Oshiwa,\r\nwho had been murdered and buried unceremoniously on the moor of Kaya\r\nin Omi province. It was long before the place of interment could be\r\ndiscovered, but at length an old woman served as guide, and the bones\r\nof the prince were found mingled in inextricable confusion with those\r\nof his loyal vassal, Nakachiko, who had shared his fate.\r\n\r\nThe ethics of that remote age are illustrated vividly in this page of\r\nthe record. A double sepulchre was erected in memory of the murdered\r\nprince and his faithful follower and the old woman who had pointed\r\nout the place of their unhonoured grave was given a house in the\r\nvicinity of the palace, a rope with a bell attached being stretched\r\nbetween the two residences to serve as a support for her infirm feet\r\nand as a means of announcing her coming when she visited the palace.\r\nBut the same benevolent sovereign who directed these gracious doings\r\nwas with difficulty dissuaded from demolishing the tomb and\r\nscattering to the winds of heaven the bones of the Emperor Yuryaku,\r\nunder whose hand Prince Oshiwa had fallen.\r\n\r\nTHE VENDETTA\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this, the introduction of the principle of the\r\nvendetta has to be noted. Its first practical application is\r\ngenerally referred to the act of the boy-prince, Mayuwa, who stabbed\r\nhis father's slayer, the Emperor Anko (A.D. 456). But the details of\r\nAnko's fate are involved in some mystery, and it is not until the\r\ntime (A.D. 486) of Kenso that we find a definite enunciation of the\r\nConfucian doctrine, afterwards rigidly obeyed in Japan, \"A man should\r\nnot live under the same heaven with his father's enemy.\" History\r\nalleges that, by his brother's counsels, the Emperor Kenso was\r\ninduced to abandon his intention of desecrating Yuryaku's tomb, but\r\nthe condition of the tomb to-day suggests that these counsels were\r\nnot entirely effective.\r\n\r\nBANQUETS\r\n\r\nThe annals of this epoch refer more than once to banquets at the\r\npalace. Towards the close of Seinei's reign we read of \"a national\r\ndrinking-festival which lasted five days,\" and when Kenso ascended\r\nthe throne he \"went to the park, where he held revel by the winding\r\nstreams,\" the high officials in great numbers being his guests. On\r\nthis latter occasion the ministers are said to have \"uttered\r\nreiterated cries of 'banzai'\"*, which has come into vogue once more in\r\nmodern times as the equivalent of \"hurrah.\"\r\n\r\n*Banzai means literally \"ten thousand years,\" and thus corresponds to\r\nviva.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR NINKEN\r\n\r\nThe twenty-fourth sovereign, Ninken, was the elder of the two\r\nbrothers, Oke and Woke, whose escape from the murderous ambition of\r\nthe Emperor Yuryaku and their ultimate restoration to princely rank\r\nhave been already described. He succeeded to the throne after the\r\ndeath of his younger brother, and occupied it for ten years of a most\r\nuneventful reign. Apart from the fact that tanners were invited from\r\nKorea to improve the process followed in Japan, the records contain\r\nnothing worthy of attention. One incident, however, deserves to be\r\nnoted as showing the paramount importance attached in those early\r\ndays to all the formalities of etiquette. The Empress dowager\r\ncommitted suicide, dreading lest she should be put to death for a\r\nbreach of politeness committed towards Ninken during the life of his\r\npredecessor, Kenso. At a banquet in the palace she had twice\r\nneglected to kneel when presenting, first, a knife and, secondly, a\r\ncup of wine to Ninken, then Prince Imperial. It has already been\r\nrelated that the Empress Onakatsu, consort of Inkyo, was disposed to\r\ninflict the death penalty on a high official who had slighted her\r\nunwittingly prior to her husband's accession. There can be no doubt\r\nthat differences of rank received most rigid recognition in early\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR MURETSU\r\n\r\nThis sovereign was the eldest son of his predecessor, Ninken.\r\nAccording to the Chronicles, his reign opened with a rebellion by the\r\ngreat Heguri family, whose representative, Matori, attempted to usurp\r\nthe Imperial dignity while his son, Shibi, defiantly wooed and won\r\nfor himself the object of the Emperor's affections. Matori had been\r\nYuryaku's minister, and his power as well as his family influence\r\nwere very great, but the military nobles adhered to the sovereign's\r\ncause and the Heguri were annihilated. In the Records this event is\r\nattributed to the reign of Seinei in a much abbreviated form, but the\r\naccount given in the Chronicles commands the greater credence. The\r\nChronicles, however, represent Muretsu as a monster of cruelty, the\r\nNero of Japanese history, who plucked out men's nails and made them\r\ndig up yams with their mutilated fingers; who pulled out people's\r\nhair; who made them ascend trees which were then cut down, and who\r\nperpetrated other hideous excesses. Here again the Records, as\r\nwell as other ancient authorities are absolutely silent, and the\r\nstory in the Chronicles has attracted keen analyses by modern\r\nhistoriographers. Their almost unanimous conclusion is that the\r\nannals of King Multa of Kudara have been confused with those of the\r\nEmperor Muretsu. This Korean sovereign, contemporary with Muretsu,\r\ncommitted all kinds of atrocities and was finally deposed by his\r\npeople. There are evidences that the compilers of the Chronicles drew\r\nlargely on the pages of Korean writers, and it is not difficult to\r\nimagine accidental intermixing such as that suggested by the critics\r\nin this case.\r\n\r\nKEITAI\r\n\r\nThe death of the Emperor Muretsu left the throne without any\r\nsuccessor in the direct line of descent, and for the first time since\r\nthe foundation of the Empire, it became necessary for the great\r\nofficials to make a selection among the scions of the remote Imperial\r\nfamilies. Their choice fell primarily on the representative of the\r\nfifth generation of the Emperor Chuai's descendants. But as their\r\nmethod of announcing their decision was to despatch a strong force of\r\narmed troops to the provincial residence of the chosen man, he\r\nnaturally misinterpreted the demonstration and sought safety in\r\nflight. Then the o-omi and the o-muraji turned to Prince Odo, fifth\r\nin descent from the Emperor Ojin on his father's side and eighth in\r\ndescent from the Emperor Suinin on his mother's. Arako, head of the\r\nhorse-keepers, had secretly informed the prince of the ministers'\r\nintentions, and thus the sudden apparition of a military force\r\ninspired no alarm in Odo's bosom. He did, indeed, show seemly\r\nhesitation, but finally he accepted the insignia and ascended the\r\nthrone, confirming all the high dignitaries of State in their\r\nprevious offices. From the point of view of domestic affairs his\r\nreign was uneventful, but the empire's relations with Korea continued\r\nto be much disturbed, as will be presently explained.\r\n\r\nANKAN\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Keitai had a large family, but only one son was by the\r\nEmpress, and as he was too young to ascend the throne immediately\r\nafter his father's death, he was preceded by his two brothers, Ankan\r\nand Senkwa, sons of the senior concubine. This complication seems to\r\nhave caused some difficulty, for whereas Keitai died in 531, Ankan's\r\nreign did not commence until 534. The most noteworthy feature of his\r\nera was the establishment of State granaries in great numbers, a\r\nproof that the Imperial power found large extension throughout the\r\nprovinces. In connexion with this, the o-muraji, Kanamura, is quoted\r\nas having laid down, by command of the Emperor, the following\r\nimportant doctrine, \"Of the entire surface of the soil, there is no\r\npart which is not a royal grant in fee; under the wide heavens there\r\nis no place which is not royal territory.\" The annals show, also,\r\nthat the custom of accepting tracts of land or other property in\r\nexpiation of offences was obtaining increased vogue.\r\n\r\nSENKWA\r\n\r\nSenkwa was the younger brother of Ankan. He reigned only three years\r\nand the period of his sway was uneventful, if we except the growth of\r\ncomplications with Korea, and the storing of large quantities of\r\ngrain in Tsukushi, as a \"provision against extraordinary occasions,\"\r\nand \"for the cordial entertainment of our good guests\" from \"the\r\ncountries beyond the sea.\"\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH KOREA\r\n\r\nWith whatever scepticism the details of the Empress Jingo's\r\nexpedition be regarded, it appears to be certain that at a very early\r\ndate, Japan effected lodgement on the south coast of Korea at Mimana,\r\nand established there a permanent station (chinju-fu) which was\r\ngoverned by one of her own officials. It is also apparent that,\r\nduring several centuries, the eminent military strength of Yamato\r\nreceived practical recognition from the principalities into which the\r\npeninsula was divided; that they sent to the Court of Japan annual\r\npresents which partook of the nature of tribute, and that they\r\ntreated her suggestions, for the most part, with deferential\r\nattention. This state of affairs received a rude shock in the days of\r\nYuryaku, when that sovereign, in order to possess himself of the wife\r\nof a high official named Tasa, sent the latter to distant Mimana as\r\ngovernor, and seized the lady in his absence. Tasa revolted, and from\r\nthat time Japan's position in the peninsula was compromised. The\r\nKoreans perceived that her strength might be paralyzed by the sins of\r\nher sovereigns and the disaffection of her soldiers. Shiragi (Sinra),\r\nwhose frontier was conterminous with that of the Japanese settlement\r\non the north, had always been restive in the proximity of a foreign\r\naggressor. From the time of Yuryaku's accession she ceased to convey\r\nthe usual tokens of respect to the Yamato Court, and, on the other\r\nhand, she cultivated the friendship of Koma as an ally in the day of\r\nretribution.\r\n\r\nIt may be broadly stated that Korea was then divided into three\r\nprincipalities: Shiragi in the south and east; Kudara in the centre\r\nand west, with its capital at the modern Seoul, and Koma in the\r\nnorth, having Pyong-yang for chief city. This last had recently\r\npushed its frontier into Manchuria as far as the Liao River, and was\r\nalready beginning to project its shadow over the southern regions of\r\nthe peninsula, destined ultimately to fall altogether under its sway.\r\nIn response to Shiragi's overtures, the King of Koma sent a body of\r\ntroops to assist in protecting that principality against any\r\nretaliatory essay on the part of the Japanese in Mimana. But the men\r\nof Shiragi, betrayed into imagining that these soldiers were destined\r\nto be the van of an invading army, massacred them, and besought\r\nJapanese succour against Koma's vengeance. The Japanese acceded, and\r\nShiragi was saved for a time, but at the cost of incurring, for\r\nherself and for Japan alike, the lasting enmity of Koma. Shiragi\r\nappears to have concluded, however, that she had more to fear from\r\nKoma than from Japan, for she still withheld her tribute to the\r\nlatter, and invaded the territory of Kudara, which had always\r\nmaintained most friendly relations with Yamato. The Emperor Yuryaku\r\nsent two expeditions to punish this contumacy, but the result being\r\ninconclusive, he resolved to take the exceptional step of personally\r\nleading an army to the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThis design, which, had it matured, might have radically changed the\r\nhistory of the Far East, was checked by an oracle, and Yuryaku\r\nappointed three of his powerful nobles to go in his stead. The\r\nShiragi men fought with desperate tenacity. One wing of their army\r\nwas broken, but the other held its ground, and two of the Japanese\r\ngenerals fell in essaying to dislodge it. Neither side could claim a\r\ndecisive victory, but both were too much exhausted to renew the\r\ncombat. This was not the limit of Japan's misfortunes. A feud broke\r\nout among the leaders of the expedition, and one of them, Oiwa, shot\r\nhis comrade as they were en route for the Court of the Kudara\r\nmonarch, who had invited them in the hope of composing their\r\ndissensions, since the existence of his own kingdom depended on\r\nJapan's intervention between Koma and Shiragi.\r\n\r\nOwing to this feud among her generals, Japan's hold on Mimana became\r\nmore precarious than ever while her prestige in the peninsula\r\ndeclined perceptibly. Nevertheless her great military name still\r\nretained much of its potency. Thus, ten years later (A.D. 477), when\r\nthe King of Koma invaded Kudara and held the land at his mercy, he\r\ndeclined to follow his generals' counsels of extermination in\r\ndeference to Kudara's long friendship with Yamato. It is related\r\nthat, after this disaster, the Japanese Emperor gave the town of\r\nUng-chhon (Japanese, Kumanari) to the remnant of the Kudara people,\r\nand the latter's capital was then transferred from its old site in\r\nthe centre of the peninsula--a place no longer tenable--to the\r\nneighbourhood of Mimana. Thenceforth Yuryaku aided Kudara zealously.\r\nHe not only despatched a force of five hundred men to guard the\r\npalace of the King, but also sent (480) a flotilla of war-vessels to\r\nattack Koma from the west coast. The issue of this attempt is not\r\nrecorded, and the silence of the annals may be construed as\r\nindicating failure. Koma maintained at that epoch relations of\r\nintimate friendship with the powerful Chinese dynasty of the Eastern\r\nWei, and Yuryaku's essays against such a combination were futile,\r\nthough he prosecuted them with considerable vigour.\r\n\r\nAfter his death the efficiency of Japan's operations in Korea was\r\ngreatly impaired by factors hitherto happily unknown in her foreign\r\naffairs--treason and corruption. Lord Oiwa, whose shooting of his\r\nfellow general, Karako, has already been noted, retained his post as\r\ngovernor of Mimana for twenty-one years, and then (487), ambitious of\r\nwider sway, opened relations with Koma for the joint invasion of\r\nKudara, in order that he himself might ascend the throne of the\r\nlatter. A desperate struggle ensued. Several battles were fought, in\r\nall of which the victory is historically assigned to Oiwa, but if he\r\nreally did achieve any success, it was purely ephemeral, for he\r\nultimately abandoned the campaign and returned to Japan, giving\r\nanother shock to his country's waning reputation in the peninsula. If\r\nthe Yamato Court took any steps to punish this act of lawless\r\nambition, there is no record in that sense. The event occurred in the\r\nlast year of Kenso's reign, and neither that monarch nor his\r\nsuccessor, Ninken, seems to have devoted any special attention to\r\nKorean affairs.\r\n\r\nNothing notable took place until 509, when Keitai was on the throne.\r\nIn that year, a section of the Kudara people, who, in 477, had been\r\ndriven from their country by the Koma invaders and had taken refuge\r\nwithin the Japanese dominion of Mimana, were restored to their homes\r\nwith Japanese co-operation and with renewal of the friendly relations\r\nwhich had long existed between the Courts of Yamato and Kudara. Three\r\nyears later (512), Kudara preferred a singular request. She asked\r\nthat four regions, forming an integral part of the Yamato domain of\r\nMimana, should be handed over to her, apparently as an act of pure\r\nbenevolence. Japan consented. There is no explanation of her\r\ncomplaisance except that she deemed it wise policy to strengthen\r\nKudara against the growing might of Shiragi, Yamato's perennial foe.\r\nThe two officials by whose advice the throne made this sacrifice were\r\nthe o-muraji, Kanamura, and the governor of Mimana, an omi called\r\nOshiyama. They went down in the pages of history as corrupt statesmen\r\nwho, in consideration of bribes from the Kudara Court, surrendered\r\nterritory which Japan had won by force of arms and held for five\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (513) the Kudara Court again utilized the\r\nservices of Oshiyama to procure possession of another district, Imun\r\n(Japanese, Komom), which lay on the northeast frontier of Mimana.\r\nKudara falsely represented that this region had been wrested from her\r\nby Habe, one of the petty principalities in the peninsula, and the\r\nYamato Court, acting at the counsels of the same o-muraji (Kanamura)\r\nwho had previously espoused Kudara's cause, credited Kudara's story.\r\nThis proved an ill-judged policy. It is true that Japan's prestige in\r\nthe peninsula received signal recognition on the occasion of\r\npromulgating the Imperial decree which sanctioned the transfer of the\r\ndisputed territory. All the parties to the dispute, Kudara, Shiragi,\r\nand Habe, were required to send envoys to the Yamato Court for the\r\npurpose of hearing the rescript read, and thus Japan's pre-eminence\r\nwas constructively acknowledged. But her order provoked keen\r\nresentment in Shiragi and Habe. The general whom she sent with five\r\nhundred warships to escort the Kudara envoys was ignominiously\r\ndefeated by the men of Habe, while Shiragi seized the opportunity to\r\ninvade Mimana and to occupy a large area of its territory.\r\n\r\nFor several years the Yamato Court made no attempt to re-assert\r\nitself, but in 527 an expedition of unprecedented magnitude was\r\norganized. It consisted of sixty thousand soldiers under the command\r\nof Keno no Omi, and its object was to chastise Shiragi and to\r\nre-establish Mimana in its original integrity. But here an\r\nunforeseeable obstacle presented itself. For all communication with\r\nthe Korean peninsula, Tsukushi (Kyushu) was an indispensable basis,\r\nand it happened that, just at this time, Kyushu had for ruler\r\n(miyatsuko) a nobleman called Iwai, who is said to have long\r\nentertained treasonable designs. A knowledge of his mood was conveyed\r\nto Shiragi, and tempting proposals were made to him from that place\r\nconditionally on his frustrating the expedition under Keno no Omi.\r\nIwai thereupon occupied the four provinces of Higo, Hizen, Bungo, and\r\nBuzen, thus effectually placing his hand on the neck of the\r\ncommunications with Korea and preventing the embarkation of Keno no\r\nOmi's army. He established a pseudo-Court in Tsukushi and there gave\r\naudience to tribute-bearing envoys from Koma, Kudara and Shiragi.\r\n\r\nFor the space of a twelvemonth this rebel remained master of the\r\nsituation, but, in A.D. 528, the o-muraji, Arakahi, crushed him after\r\na desperate conflict in the province of Chikugo.* Iwai effected his\r\nescape to Buzen and died by his own hand in a secluded valley.\r\nAlthough, however, this formidable rebellion was thus successfully\r\nquelled, the great expedition did not mature. Keno, its intended\r\nleader, did indeed proceed to Mimana and assume there the duties of\r\ngovernor, but he proved at once arrogant and incompetent, employing\r\nto an extravagant degree the ordeal of boiling water, so that many\r\ninnocent people suffered fatally, and putting to death children of\r\nmixed Korean and Japanese parentage instead of encouraging unions\r\nwhich would have tended to bring the two countries closer together.\r\n\r\n*In the Chikugo Fudoki a minute description is given of Iwai's\r\nsepulchre, built during his lifetime but presumably never occupied by\r\nhis body. The remarkable feature of the tomb was a number of stone\r\nimages, several representing grave-guards, and one group being\r\napparently designed to represent the judicial trial of a poacher.\r\n\r\nIn all her relations with Korea at this epoch, Japan showed more\r\nloyalty than sagacity. She was invariably ready to accede to\r\nproposals from her old friend, Kudara, and the latter, taking astute\r\nadvantage of this mood, secured her endorsement of territorial\r\ntransfers which brought to the Yamato Court nothing but the enmity of\r\nKudara's rivals. By these errors of statesmanship and by the\r\nmisgovernment of officials like Keno, conditions were created which,\r\nas will be seen hereafter, proved ultimately fatal to Japan's sway in\r\nthe peninsula. Meanwhile, every student of Japanese ancient annals\r\ncannot but be struck by the large space devoted to recording her\r\nrelations with Korea. As the eminent historian, Rai Sanyo, said in\r\nlater times, her soldiers were wearied by constant campaigns oversea,\r\nand her agriculturists were exhausted by frequent requisitions for\r\nsupplies. During the epoch of Jingo and Ojin, Japan was palpably\r\ninferior to her peninsular neighbour in civilization, in wealth, and\r\nin population. But in one respect the superiority was largely on her\r\nside; namely, in the quality of her soldiers. Therefore, she utilized\r\nher military strength for campaigns which cost comparatively little\r\nand produced much. The peninsula, at that time, verified the term\r\ncommonly applied to it, Uchi-tsurmiyake, or the \"Granary of the\r\nHome-land.\" But as the material development of Japan and her\r\ncivilization progressed, she stood constantly to lose more and gain\r\nless by despatching expeditions to a land which squandered much of\r\nits resources on internecine quarrels and was deteriorating by\r\ncomparison. The task of maintaining Mimana and succouring Kudara then\r\nbecame an obligation of prestige which gradually ceased to interest\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nIn the period now under consideration no system of land taxation had\r\nyet come into existence. The requirements of the Court were met by\r\nthe produce of the mi-agata (Imperial domains), and rice for public\r\nuse was grown in the miyake districts, being there stored and devoted\r\nto the administrative needs of the region. Occasionally the contents\r\nof several miyake were collected into one district, as, for example,\r\nwhen (A.D. 536) the Emperor Senkwa ordered a concentration of\r\nfoodstuffs in Tsukushi. The miyake were the property of the Crown, as\r\nwere also a number of hereditary corporations (be), whose members\r\ndischarged duties, from building and repairing palaces--no light\r\ntask, seeing that the site of the palace was changed with each change\r\nof occupant--to sericulture, weaving, tailoring, cooking, and arts\r\nand handicrafts of all descriptions, each be exercising its own\r\nfunction from generation to generation, and being superintended by\r\nits own head-man (obito or atae).\r\n\r\nAny insufficiency in the supplies furnished by the sovereign's own\r\npeople was made good by levying on the tomo-no-miyatsuko. It will be\r\nseen that there was no annual tax regularly imposed on the people in\r\ngeneral, though universal requisitions were occasionally made to meet\r\nthe requirements of public works, festivals or military operations.\r\nHence when it is said that the Emperor Nintoku remitted all taxes for\r\nthe space of three years until the people's burdens were lightened,\r\nreference is made only to the be and tomobe belonging to the Throne\r\nitself. Doubtless this special feature of Yamato finance was due in\r\npart to the fact that all the land and all the people, except those\r\nappertaining to the Crown, were in the possession of the uji, without\r\nwhose co-operation no general fiscal measure could be adopted. When\r\nrecourse to the nation at large was necessitated to meet some\r\nexceptional purpose, orders had to be given, first, to the o-omi and\r\no-muraji; next, by these to the Kami of the several o-uji; then, by\r\nthe latter to the Kami of the various ko-uji, and, finally, by these\r\nlast to every household.\r\n\r\nThe machinery was thorough, but to set it in motion required an\r\neffort which constituted an automatic obstacle to extortion. The\r\nlands and people of the uji were governed by the Emperor but were not\r\ndirectly controlled by him. On the other hand, to refuse a\r\nrequisition made by the Throne was counted contumelious and liable to\r\npunishment. Thus when (A.D. 534) the Emperor Ankan desired to include\r\na certain area of arable land in a miyake established for the purpose\r\nof commemorating the name of the Empress, and when Ajihari, suzerain\r\n(atae) of the region, sought to evade the requisition by\r\nmisrepresenting the quality of the land, he was reprimanded and had\r\nto make atonement by surrendering a portion of his private property.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that as the population increased and\r\nas uncultivated areas grew less frequent, the arbitrary establishment\r\nof koshiro or of nashiro became more and more irksome, and the pages\r\nof history indicate that from the time of Keitai (A.D. 507-531) this\r\npractice was gradually abandoned.\r\n\r\nCRIMINAL LAW\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of the ideographic script became well known from the\r\nfifth century, everything goes to show that no written law existed at\r\nthat time, or, indeed, for many years afterwards. Neither are there\r\nany traces of Korean or Chinese influence in this realm. Custom\r\nprescribed punishments, and the solemnity of a judicial trial found\r\nno better representative than the boiling-water ordeal. If a man took\r\noath to the deities of his innocence and was prepared to thrust his\r\narm into boiling mud or water, or to lay a red-hot axe on the palm of\r\nhis hand, he was held to have complied with all the requirements. The\r\nfamiliar Occidental doctrine, \"the King can do no wrong,\" received\r\nimperative recognition in Japan, and seems to have been extended to\r\nthe Crown Prince also. There were no other exemptions. If a man\r\ncommitted a crime, punishment extended to every member of his family.\r\nOn the other hand, offences might generally be expiated by presenting\r\nlands or other valuables to the Throne. As for the duty of executing\r\nsentences, it devolved on the mononobe, who may be described as the\r\nmilitary corporation. Death or exile were common forms of punishment,\r\nbut degradation was still more frequent. It often meant that a\r\nfamily, noble and opulent to-day, saw all its members handed over\r\nto-morrow to be the serfs or slaves of some uji in whose be they were\r\nenrolled to serve thenceforth, themselves and their children, through\r\nall generations in some menial position,--it might be as\r\nsepulchre-guards, it might be as scullions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTattooing on the face was another form of penalty. The first mention\r\nof it occurs in A.D. 400 when Richu condemned the muraji, Hamako, to\r\nbe thus branded, but whether the practice originated then or dated\r\nfrom an earlier period, the annals do not show. It was variously\r\ncalled hitae-kizamu (slicing the brow), me-saku (splitting the eyes),\r\nand so on, but these terms signified nothing worse than tattooing on\r\nthe forehead or round the eyes. The Emperor Richu deemed that such\r\nnotoriety was sufficient penalty for high treason, but Yuryaku\r\ninflicted tattooing on a man whose dog had killed one of his\r\nMajesty's fowls.\r\n\r\nDeath at the stake appears to have been very uncommon. This terrible\r\nform of punishment seems to have been revived by Yuryaku. He caused\r\nit to be inflicted on one of the ladies-in-waiting and her paramour,\r\nwho had forestalled him in the girl's affections. The first instance\r\nis mentioned in the annals of the Empress Jingo, but the victim was a\r\nKorean and the incident happened in war. To Yuryaku was reserved the\r\ninfamy of employing such a penalty in the case of a woman. Highly\r\nplaced personages were often allowed to expiate an offence by\r\nperforming the religious rite of harai (purification), the offender\r\ndefraying all expenses.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nAs Chinese literature became familiar and as the arts of the Middle\r\nKingdom and Korea were imported into Japan, the latter's customs\r\nnaturally underwent some changes. This was noticeable in the case of\r\narchitecture. Lofty buildings, as has been already stated, began to\r\ntake the place of the partially subterranean muro. The annals make no\r\nspecial reference to the authors of this innovation, but it is\r\nmentioned that among the descendants of the Chinese, Achi, and the\r\nKorean, Tsuka, there were men who practised carpentry. Apparently the\r\nfashion of high buildings was established in the reign of Anko when\r\n(A.D. 456) the term ro or takadono (lofty edifice) is, for the first\r\ntime, applied to the palace of Anko in Yamato. A few years later\r\n(468), we find mention of two carpenters,* Tsuguno and Mita, who,\r\nespecially the latter, were famous experts in Korean architecture,\r\nand who received orders from Yuryaku to erect high buildings. It\r\nappears further that silk curtains (tsumugi-kaki) came into use in\r\nthis age for partitioning rooms, and that a species of straw mat\r\n(tatsu-gomo) served for carpet when people were hunting, travelling,\r\nor campaigning.\r\n\r\n*It should be remembered that as all Japanese edifices were made of\r\ntimber, the carpenter and the architect were one and the same.\r\n\r\nSHIPS\r\n\r\nOccasional references have been made already to the art of\r\nshipbuilding in Japan, and the facts elicited may be summed up very\r\nbriefly. They are that the first instance of naming a ship is\r\nrecorded in the year A.D. 274, when the Karano (one hundred feet\r\nlong) was built to order of the Emperor Ojin by the carpenters of Izu\r\npromontory, which place was famed for skill in this respect; that the\r\ngeneral method of building was to hollow out tree-trunks,* and that\r\nthe arrival of naval architects from Shiragi (A.D. 300) inaugurated a\r\nsuperior method of construction, differing little from that employed\r\nin later ages.\r\n\r\n*Such dug-outs were named maruki-bune, a distinguishing term which\r\nproves that some other method of building was also employed.\r\n\r\nVEHICLES\r\n\r\nA palanquin (koshi) used by the Emperor Ojin (A.D. 270-310) was\r\npreserved in the Kyoto palace until the year 1219, when a\r\nconflagration consumed it. The records give no description of it, but\r\nthey say that Yuryaku and his Empress returned from a hunting\r\nexpedition on a cart (kuruma), and tradition relates that a man named\r\nIsa, a descendant in the eighth generation of the Emperor Sujin,\r\nbuilt a covered cart which was the very one used by Yuryaku. It is,\r\nindeed, more than probable that a vehicle which had been in use in\r\nChina for a long time must have become familiar to the Japanese at an\r\nearly epoch.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL ART\r\n\r\nFor relief in sickness supplication to the gods and the performance\r\nof religious rites were chiefly relied on. But it is alleged* that\r\nmedicines for internal and external use were in existence and that\r\nrecourse to thermal springs was commonly practised from remote times.\r\n\r\n*By the Nihon Bummei Shiryaku.\r\n\r\nPICTORIAL ART\r\n\r\nWhile Yuryaku was on the throne, Korea and China sent pictorial\r\nexperts to Japan. The Korean was named Isuraka, and the Chinese,\r\nShinki. The latter is said to have been a descendant of the Emperor\r\nWen of the Wei dynasty. His work attracted much attention in the\r\nreign of Muretsu, who bestowed on him the uji title of Ooka no Obito.\r\nHis descendants practised their art with success in Japan, and from\r\nthe time of the Emperor Tenchi (668-671) they were distinguished as\r\nYamato no eshi (painters of Yamato).\r\n\r\nPOETRY\r\n\r\nIf we credit the annals, the composition of poetry commenced in the\r\nearliest ages and was developed independently of foreign influences.\r\nFrom the sovereign down to the lowest subject, everyone composed\r\nverses. These were not rhymed; the structure of the Japanese language\r\ndoes not lend itself to rhyme. Their differentiation from prose\r\nconsisted solely in the numerical regularity of the syllables in\r\nconsecutive lines; the alternation of phrases of five and seven\r\nsyllables each. A tanka (short song) consisted of thirty-one\r\nsyllables arranged thus, 5, 7, 5, 7, and 7; and a naga-uta (long\r\nsong) consisted of an unlimited number of lines, all fulfilling the\r\nsame conditions as to number of syllables and alternation of phrases.\r\nNo parallel to this kind of versification has been found yet in the\r\nliterature of any other nation. The Chronicles and the Records abound\r\nwith tanka and naga-uta, many of which have been ascribed by skeptics\r\nto an age not very remote from the time when those books were\r\ncompiled. But the Japanese themselves think differently. They connect\r\nthe poems directly with the events that inspired them. Further\r\nreference to the subject will be made hereafter. Here it will suffice\r\nto note that the composing of such verselets was a feature of every\r\nage in Japan.\r\n\r\nUTA-GAKI\r\n\r\nA favourite pastime during the early historic period was known as\r\nuta-gaki or uta-kai. In cities, in the country, in fields, and on\r\nhills, youths and maidens assembled in springtime or in autumn and\r\nenjoyed themselves by singing and dancing. Promises of marriage were\r\nexchanged, the man sending some gifts as a token, and the woman, if\r\nher father or elder brother approved, despatching her head-ornament\r\n(oshiki no tamakatsura) to her lover. On the wedding day it was\r\ncustomary for the bride to present \"table-articles\" (tsukue-shiro) to\r\nthe bridegroom in the form of food and drink. There were places\r\nspecially associated in the public mind with uta-gaki--Tsukuba\r\nMountain in Hitachi, Kijima-yama in Hizen, and Utagaki-yama in\r\nSettsu. Sometimes men of noble birth took part in this pastime, but\r\nit was usually confined to the lower middle classes. The great\r\nfestival of bon-odori, which will be spoken of by and by, is said to\r\nbe an outgrowth of the uta-gaki.\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIONS\r\n\r\nNo influences of alien character affected the religious beliefs of\r\nthe Japanese during the period we are now considering (fourth, fifth,\r\nand sixth centuries). The most characteristic feature of the time was\r\na belief in the supernatural power of reptiles and animals. This\r\ncredulity was not limited to the uneducated masses. The Throne itself\r\nshared it. Yuryaku, having expressed a desire to see the incarnated\r\nform of the Kami of Mimoro Mountain, was shown a serpent seventy feet\r\nlong. In the same year a group of snakes harrassed a man who was\r\nreclaiming a marsh, so that he had to take arms against them and\r\nenter into a compact of limitations and of shrine building. Other\r\nrecords of maleficent deities in serpent shape were current, and\r\nmonkeys and dragons inspired similar terror. Of this superstition\r\nthere was born an evil custom, the sacrifice of human beings to\r\nappease the hostile spirits. The Kami of Chusan in Mimasaka province\r\nwas believed to be a giant ape, and the Kami of Koya, a big reptile.\r\nThe people of these two districts took it in turn to offer a girl at\r\nthe shrines of those Kami, and in the province of Hida another\r\ncolossal monkey was similarly appeased. There were further cases of\r\nextravagant superstition.\r\n\r\nARTS AND CRAFTS\r\n\r\nOf the development of sericulture and of the arts of weaving and\r\nceramics in this era enough has already been written; but, as showing\r\nthe growth of refinement, it may be noted that among the articles\r\nordered by the Emperor Yuryaku were a silk hat and a sashiha, or\r\nround fan with a long handle. The colour of the fan was purple, and\r\nit is said to have been hung up as an ornament in the palace.\r\n\r\nFORM OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe original form of government under the Yamato seems to have been\r\nfeudal. The heads of uji were practically feudal chiefs. Even orders\r\nfrom the Throne had to pass through the uji no Kami in order to reach\r\nthe people. But from the time of Nintoku (313-349) to that of Yuryaku\r\n(457-479), the Court wielded much power, and the greatest among the\r\nuji chiefs found no opportunity to interfere with the exercise of the\r\nsovereign's rights. Gradually, however, and mainly owing to the\r\nintrusion of love affairs or of lust, the Imperial household fell\r\ninto disorder, which prompted the revolt of Heguri, the o-omi of the\r\nKwobetsu (Imperial families); a revolt subdued by the loyalty of the\r\no-muraji of the Shimbetsu (Kami families).\r\n\r\nFrom the days of the Emperor Muretsu (499-506), direct heirs to\r\nsucceed to the sceptre were wanting in more than one instance, and a\r\nunique opportunity thus offered for traitrous essays. There was none.\r\nMen's minds were still deeply imbued with the conviction that by the\r\nTenjin alone might the Throne be occupied. But with the introduction\r\nof Buddhism (A.D. 552), that conviction received a shock. That the\r\nBuddha directed and controlled man's destiny was a doctrine\r\ninconsistent with the traditional faith in the divine authority of\r\nthe \"son of heaven.\" Hence from the sixth century the prestige of the\r\nCrown began to decline, and the puissance of the great uji grew to\r\nexceed that of the sovereign. During a short period (645-670) the\r\nauthority of the Throne was reasserted, owing to the adoption of the\r\nTang systems of China; but thereafter the great Fujiwara-uji became\r\nparamount and practically administered the empire.\r\n\r\nFor the sake, therefore, of an intelligent sequence of conception,\r\nthere is evidently much importance in determining whether, in remote\r\nantiquity, the prevailing system was feudal, or prefectural, or a\r\nmixture of both. Unfortunately the materials for accurate\r\ndifferentiation are wanting. Much depends on a knowledge of the\r\nfunctions discharged by the kuni-no-miyatsuko, who were hereditary\r\nofficials, and the kuni-no-tsukasa (or kokushi) who were appointed by\r\nthe Throne. The closest research fails to elucidate these things with\r\nabsolute clearness. It is not known even at what date the office of\r\nkokushi was established. The first mention of these officials is made\r\nin the year A.D. 374, during the reign of Nintoku, but there can be\r\nlittle doubt that they had existed from an earlier date. They were,\r\nhowever, few in number, whereas the miyatsuko were numerous, and this\r\ncomparison probably furnishes a tolerably just basis for estimating\r\nthe respective prevalence of the prefectural and the feudal systems.\r\nIn short, the method of government inaugurated at the foundation of\r\nthe empire appears to have been essentially feudal in practice,\r\nthough theoretically no such term was recognized; and at a later\r\nperiod--apparently about the time of Nintoku--when the power of the\r\nhereditary miyatsuko threatened to grow inconveniently formidable,\r\nthe device of reasserting the Throne's authority by appointing\r\ntemporary provincial governors was resorted to, so that the\r\nprefectural organization came into existence side by side with the\r\nfeudal, and the administration preserved this dual form until the\r\nmiddle of the seventh century. There will be occasion to refer to the\r\nmatter again at a later date.\r\n\r\nANNALS OF THE UJI\r\n\r\nIt is essential to an intelligent appreciation of Japanese history\r\nthat some knowledge should be acquired of the annals of the great\r\nuji.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Nintoku (A.D. 313-399) until the introduction of\r\nBuddhism (A.D. 552), there were four uji whose chiefs participated\r\nconspicuously in the government of the country. The first was that of\r\nHeguri. It belonged to the Imperial class (Kwobetsu) and was\r\ndescended from the celebrated Takenouchi-no-Sukune. In the days of\r\nthe Emperor Muretsu (499-506), the chief of this uji attempted to\r\nusurp the throne and was crushed. The second was the Otomo. This uji\r\nbelonged to the Kami class (Shimbetsu) and had for ancestor Michi no\r\nOmi, the most distinguished general in the service of the first\r\nEmperor Jimmu. The chiefs of the Otomo-uji filled the post of general\r\nfrom age to age, and its members guarded the palace gates. During the\r\nreign of Yuryaku the office of o-muraji was bestowed upon Moroya,\r\nthen chief of this uji, and the influence he wielded may be inferred\r\nfrom the language of an Imperial rescript where it is said that \"the\r\ntami-be of the o-muraji fill the country.\" His son, Kanamura,\r\nsucceeded him. By his sword the rebellion of Heguri no Matori was\r\nquelled, and by his advice Keitai was called to the Throne. He served\r\nalso under Ankan, Senkwa, and Kimmei, but the miscarriage of Japan's\r\nrelations with Korea was attributed to him, and the title of o-muraji\r\nwas not conferred on any of his descendants.\r\n\r\nThe uji of Mononobe next calls for notice. \"Monono-be\" literally\r\nsignifies, when expanded, a group (be) of soldiers (tsuwamono). In\r\nlater times a warrior in Japan was called mono-no-fu (or bushi),\r\nwhich is written with the ideographs mono-be. This uji also belonged\r\nto the Kami class, and its progenitor was Umashimade, who surrendered\r\nYamato to Jimmu on the ground of consanguinity. Thenceforth the\r\nmembers of the uji formed the Imperial guards (uchi-tsu-mononobe) and\r\nits chiefs commanded them. Among all the uji of the Kami class the\r\nMononobe and the Otomo ranked first, and after the latter's failure\r\nin connexion with Korea, the Mononobe stood alone. During the reign\r\nof Yuryaku, the uji's chief became o-muraji, as did his grandson,\r\nOkoshi, and the latter's son, Moriya, was destroyed by the o-omi,\r\nSoga no Umako, in the tumult on the accession of Sushun (A.D. 588).\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the great uji was the Soga, descended from\r\nTakenouchi-no-Sukune. After the ruin of the Heguri, this uji stood at\r\nthe head of all the Imperial class. In the reign of Senkwa (536-539),\r\nIname, chief of the Soga, was appointed o-omi, and his son, Umako,\r\nwho held the same rank, occupies an important place in connexion with\r\nthe introduction of Buddhism. It will be observed that among these\r\nfour uji, Heguri and Soga served as civil officials and Otomo and\r\nMononobe as military.\r\n\r\nThere are also three other uji which figure prominently on the stage\r\nof Japanese history. They are the Nakotomi, the Imibe, and the Kume.\r\nThe Nakatomi discharged the functions of religious supplication and\r\ndivination, standing, for those purposes, between (Naka) the Throne\r\nand the deities. The Imibe had charge of everything relating to\r\nreligious festivals; an office which required that they should\r\nabstain (imi suru) from all things unclean. The Kume were descended\r\nfrom Amatsu Kume no Mikoto, and their duties were to act as\r\nchamberlains and as guards of the Court.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was the Oga-uji, descended from Okuninushi, which\r\nmakes the eighth of the great uji. From the time of the Emperor Jimmu\r\nto that of the Empress Suiko (A.D. 593-628), the nobles who served in\r\nministerial capacities numbered forty and of that total the Mononobe\r\nfurnished sixteen; the Otomo, six; the o-omi houses (i.e. the\r\nKwobetsu), nine; the Imibe, one; the Nakatomi, six; and the Oga, two.\r\nThus, the military uji of Mononobe and Otomo gave to the State\r\ntwenty-two ministers out of forty during a space of some twelve\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PROFESSIONAL STORY-TELLER\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SHIGURETEI AND KASA-NO-CHAYA IN THE KODAIJI (Examples of\r\nAncient Tea Houses)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFROM THE 29TH TO THE 35TH SOVEREIGN\r\n\r\nThe 29th Sovereign, Kimmei  A.D. 540-571\r\n\r\n \"  30th    \"       Bidatsu  \"   572-585\r\n\r\n \"  31st    \"       Yomei    \"   586-587\r\n\r\n \"  32nd    \"       Sushun   \"   588-592\r\n\r\n \"  33rd    \"       Suiko    \"   593-628\r\n\r\n \"  34th    \"       Jomei    \"   629-641\r\n\r\n \"  35th    \"       Kogyoku  \"   642-645\r\n\r\nTHE seven reigns five Emperors and two Empresses commencing with the\r\nEmperor Kimmei and ending with the Empress Kogyoku, covered a period\r\nof 105 years, from 540 to 645, and are memorable on three accounts:\r\nthe introduction of Buddhism; the usurpation of the great uji, and\r\nthe loss of Japan's possessions in Korea.\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF BUDDHISM\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the Emperor Ming of the Hou-Han dynasty, in the\r\nyear AD. 65, a mission was sent from China to procure the Buddhist\r\nSutras as well as some teachers of the Indian faith. More than three\r\ncenturies elapsed before, in the year 372, the creed obtained a\r\nfooting in Korea; and not for another century and a half did it find\r\nits way (522) to Japan. It encountered no obstacles in Korea. The\r\nanimistic belief of the early Koreans has never been clearly studied,\r\nbut whatever its exact nature may have been, it certainly evinced no\r\nbigotry in the presence of the foreign faith, for within three years\r\nof the arrival of the first image of Sakiya Muni in Koma, two large\r\nmonasteries had been built, and the King and his Court were all\r\nconverts.\r\n\r\nNo such reception awaited Buddhism in Japan when, in 522, a Chinese\r\nbonze, Shiba Tachito, arrived, erected a temple on the Sakata plain\r\nin Yamato, enshrined an image, of Buddha there, and endeavoured to\r\npropagate the faith. At that time, Wu, the first Emperor of the Liang\r\ndynasty in China, was employing all his influence to popularize the\r\nIndian creed. Tradition says that Shiba Tachito came from Liang, and\r\nin all probability he took the overland route via the Korean\r\npeninsula, but the facts are obscure. No sensible impression seems to\r\nhave been produced in Japan by this essay. Buddhism was made known to\r\na few, but the Japanese showed no disposition to worship a foreign\r\ngod. Twenty-three years later (545), the subject attracted attention\r\nagain. Song Wang Myong, King of Kudara, menaced by a crushing attack\r\non the part of Koma and Shiragi in co-operation, made an image of the\r\nBuddha, sixteen feet high, and petitioned the Court of Yamato in the\r\nsense that as all good things were promised in the sequel of such an\r\neffort, protection should be extended to him by Japan. Tradition says\r\nthat although Buddhism had not yet secured a footing in Yamato, this\r\nimage must be regarded as the pioneer of many similar objects\r\nsubsequently set up in Japanese temples.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, A.D. 552 is usually spoken of as the date of Buddhism's\r\nintroduction into Japan. In that year the same King of Kudara\r\npresented direct to the Yamato Court a copper image of Buddha plated\r\nwith gold; several canopies (tengai), and some volumes of the sacred\r\nbooks, by the hands of Tori Shichi (Korean pronunciation, Nori\r\nSachhi) and others. The envoys carried also a memorial which said:\r\n\"This doctrine is, among all, most excellent. But it is difficult to\r\nexplain and difficult to understand. Even the Duke Chou and Confucius\r\ndid not attain to comprehension. It can produce fortune and\r\nretribution, immeasurable, illimitable. It can transform a man into a\r\nBodhi. Imagine a treasure capable of satisfying all desires in\r\nproportion as it is used. Such a treasure is this wonderful doctrine.\r\nEvery earnest supplication is fulfilled and nothing is wanting.\r\nMoreover, from farthest India to the three Han, all have embraced the\r\ndoctrine, and there is none that does not receive it with reverence\r\nwherever it is preached. Therefore thy servant, Myong, in all\r\nsincerity, sends his retainer, Nori Sachhi, to transmit it to the\r\nImperial country, that it may be diffused abroad throughout the home\r\nprovinces,* so as to fulfil the recorded saying of the Buddha, 'My\r\nlaw shall spread to the East.'\"** It is highly probable that in the\r\neffort to win the Yamato Court to Buddhism, King Myong was influenced\r\nas much by political as by moral motives. He sought to use the\r\nforeign faith as a link to bind Japan to his country, so that he\r\nmight count on his oversea neighbour's powerful aid against the\r\nattacks of Koma and Shiragi.\r\n\r\n*That is to say, the Kinai, or five provinces, of which Yamato is the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n**The memorial is held by some critics to be of doubtful\r\nauthenticity, though the compilers of the Chronicles may have\r\ninserted it in good faith.\r\n\r\nA more interesting question, however, is the aspect under which the\r\nnew faith presented itself to the Japanese when it first arrived\r\namong them as a rival of Shinto and Confucianism. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the form in which it became known at the outset was the\r\nHinayana, or Exoteric, as distinguished from the Mahayana, or\r\nEsoteric. But how did the Japanese converts reconcile its acceptance\r\nwith their allegiance to the traditional faith, Shinto? The clearest\r\navailable answer to this question is contained in a book called\r\nTaishiden Hochu, where, in reply to a query from his father, Yomei,\r\nwho professed inability to believe foreign doctrines at variance with\r\nthose handed down from the age of the Kami, Prince Shotoku is\r\nrecorded to have replied:\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty has considered only one aspect of the matter. I am\r\nyoung and ignorant, but I have carefully studied the teachings of\r\nConfucius and the doctrine of the Kami. I find that there is a plain\r\ndistinction. Shinto, since its roots spring from the Kami, came into\r\nexistence simultaneously with the heaven and the earth, and thus\r\nexpounds the origin of human beings. Confucianism, being a system of\r\nmoral principles, is coeval with the people and deals with the middle\r\nstage of humanity. Buddhism, the fruit of principles, arose when the\r\nhuman intellect matured. It explains the last stage of man. To like\r\nor dislike Buddhism without any reason is simply an individual\r\nprejudice. Heaven commands us to obey reason. The individual cannot\r\ncontend against heaven. Recognizing that impossibility, nevertheless\r\nto rely on the individual is not the act of a wise man or an\r\nintelligent. Whether the Emperor desire to encourage this creed is a\r\nmatter within his own will. Should he desire to reject it, let him do\r\nso; it will arise one generation later. Should he desire to adopt it,\r\nlet him do so; it will arise one generation earlier. A generation is\r\nas one moment in heaven's eyes. Heaven is eternal. The Emperor's\r\nreign is limited to a generation; heaven is boundless and\r\nillimitable. How can the Emperor struggle against heaven? How can\r\nheaven be concerned about a loss of time?\"\r\n\r\nThe eminent modern Japanese historiographer, Dr. Ariga, is disposed\r\nto regard the above as the composition of some one of later date than\r\nthe illustrious Shotoku, but he considers that it rightly represents\r\nthe relation assigned to the three doctrines by the Japanese of the\r\nsixth and seventh centuries. \"Shinto teaches about the origin of the\r\ncountry but does not deal with the present or the future.\r\nConfucianism discusses the present and has no concern with the past\r\nor the future. Buddhism, alone, preaches about the future. That life\r\nends with the present cannot be believed by all. Many men think of\r\nthe future, and it was therefore inevitable that many should embrace\r\nBuddhism.\"\r\n\r\nBut at the moment when the memorial of King Myong was presented to\r\nthe Emperor Kimmei, the latter was unprepared to make a definite\r\nreply. The image, indeed, he found to be full of dignity, but he left\r\nhis ministers to decide whether it should be worshipped or not. A\r\ndivision of opinion resulted. The o-omi, Iname, of the Soga family,\r\nadvised that, as Buddhism had won worship from all the nations on the\r\nWest, Japan should not be singular. But the o-muraji, Okoshi, of the\r\nMononobe-uji, and Kamako, muraji of the Nakatomi-uji, counselled that\r\nto bow down to foreign deities would be to incur the anger of the\r\nnational gods. In a word, the civil officials advocated the adoption\r\nof the Indian creed; the military and ecclesiastical officials\r\nopposed it. That the head of the Mononobe-uji should have adopted\r\nthis attitude was natural: it is always the disposition of soldiers\r\nto be conservative, and that is notably true of the Japanese soldier\r\n(bushi). In the case of the Nakatomi, also, we have to remember that\r\nthey were, in a sense, the guardians of the Shinto ceremonials: thus,\r\ntheir aversion to the acceptance of a strange faith is explained.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be said, however, of the apparently radical policy of the\r\nSoga chief? Why should he have advocated so readily the introduction\r\nof a foreign creed? There are two apparent reasons. One is that the\r\nHata and Aya groups of Korean and Chinese artisans were under the\r\ncontrol of the Soga-uji, and that the latter were therefore disposed\r\nto welcome all innovations coming from the Asiatic continent. The\r\nother is that between the o-muraji of the Kami class (Shimbetsu) and\r\nthe o-omi of the Imperial class (Kwobetsu) there had existed for some\r\ntime a political rivalry which began to be acute at about the period\r\nof the coming of Buddhism, and which was destined to culminate, forty\r\nyears later, in a great catastrophe. The Emperor himself steered a\r\nmiddle course. He neither opposed nor approved but entrusted the\r\nimage to the keeping of the Soga noble. Probably his Majesty was not\r\nunwilling to submit the experiment to a practical test vicariously,\r\nfor it is to be noted that, in those days, the influence of the Kami\r\nfor good or for evil was believed to be freely exercised in human\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThis last consideration does not seem to have influenced Soga no\r\nIname at all. He must have been singularly free from the\r\nsuperstitions of his age, for he not only received the image with\r\npleasure but also enshrined it with all solemnity in his Mukuhara\r\nresidence, which he converted wholly into a temple.\r\n\r\nVery shortly afterwards, however, the country was visited by a\r\npestilence, and the calamity being regarded as an expression of the\r\nKami's resentment, the o-muraji of the Mononobe and the muraji of the\r\nNakatomi urged the Emperor to cast out the emblems of a foreign\r\nfaith. Accordingly, the statue of the Buddha was thrown into the\r\nNaniwa canal and the temple was burned to the ground. Necessarily\r\nthese events sharply accentuated the enmity between the Soga and the\r\nMononobe. Twenty-five years passed, however, without any attempt to\r\nrestore the worship of the Buddha. Iname, the o-omi of the Soga,\r\ndied; Okoshi, the o-muraji of the Mononobe, died, and they were\r\nsucceeded in these high offices by their sons, Umako and Moriya,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor Bidatsu ascended the throne in A.D. 572, the\r\npolitical stage was practically occupied by these two ministers only;\r\nthey had no competitors of equal rank. In 577, the King of Kudara\r\nmade a second attempt to introduce Buddhism into Japan. He sent to\r\nthe Yamato Court two hundred volumes of sacred books; an ascetic; a\r\nyogi (meditative monk); a nun; a reciter of mantras (magic spells); a\r\nmaker of images, and a temple architect. If any excitement was caused\r\nby this event, the annals say nothing of the fact. It is briefly\r\nrelated that ultimately a temple was built for the new-comers in\r\nNaniwa (modern Osaka). Two years later, Shiragi also sent a Buddhist\r\neidolon, and in 584--just sixty-two years after the coming of Shiba\r\nTachito from Liang and thirty-two years after Soga no Iname's attempt\r\nto popularize the Indian faith--two Japanese high officials returned\r\nfrom Korea, carrying with them a bronze image of Buddha and a stone\r\nimage of Miroku.* These two images were handed over, at his request,\r\nto the o-omi, Umako, who had inherited his father's ideas about\r\nBuddhism. He invited Shiba Tachito, then a village mayor, to\r\naccompany one Hida on a search throughout the provinces for Buddhist\r\ndevotees. They found a man called Eben, a Korean who had originally\r\nbeen a priest, and he, having resumed the stole, consecrated the\r\ntwelve-year-old daughter of Shiba Tachito, together with two other\r\ngirls, as nuns. The o-omi now built a temple, where the image of\r\nMiroku was enshrined, and a pagoda on the top of whose central pillar\r\nwas deposited a Buddhist relic which had shown miraculous powers.\r\n\r\n*The Sanskrit Maitreya, the expected Messiah of the Buddhist.\r\n\r\nThus, once more the creed of Sakiya Muni seemed to have found a\r\nfooting in Japan. But again the old superstitions prevailed. The\r\nplague of small-pox broke out once more. This fell disease had been\r\ncarried from Cochin China by the troops of General Ma Yuan during the\r\nHan dynasty, and it reached Japan almost simultaneously with the\r\nimportation of Buddhism. The physicians of the East had no skill in\r\ntreating it, and its ravages were terrible, those that escaped with\r\ntheir lives having generally to lament the loss of their eyes. So\r\nsoon as the malady made its second appearance in the immediate sequel\r\nof the new honours paid to Buddhism, men began to cry out that the\r\nKami were punishing the nation's apostacy, and the o-muraji, Moriya,\r\nurged the Emperor (Bidatsu) to authorize the suppression of the alien\r\nreligion. Bidatsu, who at heart had always been hostile to the\r\ninnovation, consented readily, and the o-muraji, taking upon himself\r\nthe duty of directing the work of iconoclasm, caused the pagoda and\r\nthe temple to be razed and burned, threw the image into the canal,\r\nand flogged the nuns. But the pestilence was not stayed. Its ravages\r\ngrew more unsparing. The Emperor himself, as well as the o-omi,\r\nUmako, were attacked, and now the popular outcry took another tone:\r\nmen ascribed the plague to the wrath of Buddha. Umako, in turn,\r\npleaded with the Emperor, and was permitted to rebuild the temple and\r\nreinstate the nuns, on condition that no efforts were made to\r\nproselytize.\r\n\r\nThus Buddhism recovered its footing, but the enmity between the\r\no-muraji and the o-omi grew more implacable than ever. They insulted\r\neach other, even at the obsequies of the sovereign, and an occasion\r\nalone was needed to convert their anger into an appeal to arms.\r\n\r\nDISPUTES ABOUT THE ACCESSION\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor Bidatsu died (A.D. 585) no nomination of a Prince\r\nImperial had taken place, and the feud known to exist between the\r\no-omi and the o-muraji increased the danger of the situation. The\r\nfollowing genealogical table will serve to elucidate the relation in\r\nwhich the Soga-uji stood to the Imperial Family, as well as the\r\nrelation between the members of the latter:\r\n\r\n                                                   \\\r\n                                                   |  Prince Shotoku******\r\n                           / Emperor Yomei**        > (married to a daughter\r\n          /             \\  | (originally Prince Oe)|  of Soga no Umako)\r\n       |Princess Kitashi|  |                       /\r\n       |(consort of      ><  Empress Suiko*****\r\n       |Emperor Kimmei* |  | (originally consort\r\n       |                /  | of Emperor Bidatsu***\r\nSoga   |                   \\\r\n no   <\r\nIname  |                \\  /\r\n       |Oane-kimi       |  | Prince Anahobe*******\r\n       |(consort of      ><\r\n       |Emperor Kimmei) |  | Emperor Sushun****\r\n       |                /  \\\r\n       |\r\n       |Omako-Emishi-Iruka\r\n       \\\r\n\r\n*The Emperor Kimmei was the elder brother-in-law of Soga no Umako.\r\n**The Emperor Yomei was the nephew of Soga no Umako.\r\n***The Emperor Bidatsu was a nephew of Umako.\r\n****The Emperor Sushun was a nephew of Umako.\r\n*****The Empress Suiko was a niece of Umako.\r\n******Prince Shotoku was son-in-law of Umako.\r\n*******Prince Anahobe was a nephew of Umako.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the great uji of Soga was closely related to all\r\nthe Imperial personages who figured prominently on the stage at this\r\nperiod of Japanese history.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR YOMEI\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Yomei was the fourth son of the Emperor Kimmei and a\r\nnephew of the o-omi, Umako. The Chronicles say that he \"believed in\r\nthe law of Buddha and reverenced Shinto\" which term now makes its\r\nfirst appearance on the page of Japanese history, the Kami alone\r\nhaving been spoken of hitherto. Yomei's accession was opposed by his\r\nyounger brother, Prince Anahobe (vide above genealogical table), who\r\nhad the support of the o-muraji, Moriya; but the Soga influence was\r\nexerted in Yomei's behalf. Anahobe did not suffer his discomfiture\r\npatiently. He attempted to procure admission to the mourning chamber\r\nof the deceased Emperor for some unexplained purpose, and being\r\nresisted by Miwa Sako, who commanded the palace guards, he laid a\r\nformal complaint before the o-omi and the o-muraji. In the sequel\r\nSako was killed by the troops of the o-muraji, though he merited\r\nrather the latter's protection as a brave soldier who had merely done\r\nhis duty, who opposed Buddhism, and who enjoyed the confidence of the\r\nEmpress Dowager. To Umako, predicting that this deed of undeserved\r\nviolence would prove the beginning of serious trouble, Moriya\r\ninsultingly retorted that small-minded men did not understand such\r\nmatters. Moriya's mind was of the rough military type. He did not\r\nfathom the subtle unscrupulous intellect of an adversary like Umako,\r\nand was destined to learn the truth by a bitter process.\r\n\r\nSHOTOKU TAISHI\r\n\r\nUmayado, eldest son of the Emperor Yomei, is one of the most\r\ndistinguished figures in the annals of Japan. He has been well called\r\n\"the Constantine of Buddhism.\" In proof of his extraordinary\r\nsagacity, the Chronicles relate that in a lawsuit he could hear the\r\nevidence of ten men without confusing them. From his earliest youth\r\nhe evinced a remarkable disposition for study. A learned man was\r\ninvited from China to teach him the classics, and priests were\r\nbrought from Koma to expound the doctrine of Buddhism, in which faith\r\nhe ultimately became a profound believer. In fact, to his influence,\r\nmore than to any other single factor, may be ascribed the final\r\nadoption of the Indian creed by Japan. He never actually ascended the\r\nthrone, but as regent under the Empress Suiko he wielded Imperial\r\nauthority. In history he is known as Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).\r\n\r\nFINAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE MONONOBE AND THE SOGA\r\n\r\nIn the second year of his reign, the Emperor Yomei was seized with\r\nthe malady which had killed his father. In his extremity he desired\r\nto be received into the Buddhist faith to which he had always\r\ninclined, and he ordered the leading officials to consider the\r\nmatter. A council was held. Moriya, o-muraji of the Mononobe, and\r\nKatsumi, muraji of the Nakatomi, objected resolutely. They asked why\r\nthe Kami of the country should be abandoned in a moment of crisis.\r\nBut Umako, o-omi of the Soga, said: \"It is our duty to obey the\r\nImperial commands and to give relief to his Majesty. Who will dare to\r\nsuggest contumely?\" Buddhist priests were then summoned to the\r\npalace. It was a moment of extreme tension. Prince Umayado (Shotoku)\r\ngrasped the hands of the o-omi and exclaimed, \"If the minister had\r\nnot believed in Buddhism, who would have ventured to give such\r\ncounsel?\" Umako's answer is said to have been: \"Your Imperial\r\nHighness will work for the propagation of the faith. I, a humble\r\nsubject, will maintain it to the death.\" Moriya, the o-muraji, made\r\nno attempt to hide his resentment, but recognizing that his adherents\r\nin the palace were comparatively few, he withdrew to a safe place and\r\nthere concentrated his forces, endeavouring, at the same time, to\r\nenlist by magic rites the assistance of the Kami against the\r\ndisciples of the foreign faith. Meanwhile the Emperor's malady ended\r\nfatally. His reign had lasted only one year. At the point of death he\r\nwas comforted by an assurance that the son of Shiba Tachito would\r\nrenounce the world to revere his Majesty's memory and would make an\r\nimage of the Buddha sixteen feet high.\r\n\r\nBuddhism had now gained a firm footing at the Yamato Court, but its\r\nopponents were still active. Their leader, the o-muraji, thought that\r\nhis best chance of success was to contrive the accession of Prince\r\nAnahobe, whose attempt to take precedence of his elder brother, the\r\nEmperor Yomei, has been already noted. The conspiracy was discovered,\r\nand the Soga forces, acting under the nominal authority of the\r\ndeceased Emperor's consort, Umako's niece, moved against Anahobe and\r\nMoriya, who had not been able to combine their strength. The\r\ndestruction of Prince Anahobe was easily effected, but the work of\r\ndealing with the o-muraji taxed the resources of the Soga to the\r\nutmost. Moriya himself ascended a tree and by skill of archery held\r\nhis assailants long at bay. Archery had been practised assiduously by\r\nthe Yamato warrior from time immemorial, and arrows possessing\r\nremarkable power of penetration had been devised. During the reign of\r\nNintoku, when envoys from Koma presented to the Court iron shields\r\nand iron targets, a Japanese archer, Tatebito, was able to pierce\r\nthem; and in the time of Yuryaku, a rebel named Iratsuko shot a shaft\r\nwhich, passing through his adversary's shield and twofold armour,\r\nentered the flesh of his body to the depth of an inch. There was an\r\narchery hall within the enclosure of the palace; whenever envoys or\r\nfunctionaries from foreign countries visited Yamato they were invited\r\nto shoot there; frequent trials of skill took place, and when oversea\r\nsovereigns applied for military aid, it was not unusual to send some\r\nbundles of arrows in lieu of soldiers.\r\n\r\nThus, the general of the Mononobe, perched among the branches of a\r\ntree, with an unlimited supply of shafts and with highly trained\r\nskill as a bowman, was a formidable adversary. Moriya and his large\r\nfollowing of born soldiers drove back the Soga forces three times.\r\nSuccess seemed to be in sight for the champion of the Kami. At this\r\ndesperate stage Prince Shotoku--then a lad of sixteen--fastened to\r\nhis helmet images of the \"Four Guardian Kings of Heaven\"* and vowed\r\nto build a temple in their honour if victory was vouchsafed to his\r\narms. At the same time, the o-omi, Umako, took oath to dedicate\r\ntemples and propagate Buddhism. The combat had now assumed a\r\ndistinctly religious character. Shotoku and Umako advanced again to\r\nthe attack; Moriya was shot down; his family and followers fled, were\r\nput to the sword or sent into slavery, and all his property was\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\n*The \"Four Guardian Kings\" (Shi-Tenno) are the warriors who guard the\r\nworld against the attacks of demons.\r\n\r\nAn incident of this campaign illustrates the character of the\r\nJapanese soldier as revealed in the pages of subsequent history: a\r\ncharacter whose prominent traits were dauntless courage and romantic\r\nsympathy. Yorozu, a dependent of the o-muraji, was reduced to the\r\nlast straits after a desperate fight. The Chronicles say: \"Then he\r\ntook the sword which he wore, cut his bow into three pieces, and\r\nbending his sword, flung it into the river. With a dagger which he\r\nhad besides, he stabbed himself in the throat and died. The governor\r\nof Kawachi having reported the circumstances of Yorozu's death to the\r\nCourt, the latter gave an order by a stamp* that his body should be\r\ncut into eight pieces and distributed among the eight provinces.\"**\r\nIn accordance with this order the governor was about to dismember the\r\ncorpse when thunder pealed and a great rain fell. \"Now there was a\r\nwhite dog which had been kept by Yorozu. Looking up and looking down,\r\nit went round, howling beside the body, and at last, taking up the\r\nhead in its mouth, it placed it on an ancient mound, lay down close\r\nby, and starved to death. When this was reported to the Court, the\r\nlatter, moved by profound pity, issued an order that the dog's\r\nconduct should be handed down to after ages, and that the kindred of\r\nYorozu should be allowed to construct a tomb and bury his remains.\"\r\n\r\n*A stamp in red or black on the palm of the hand.\r\n\r\n**This custom of dismembering and distributing the remains was\r\npractised in Korea until the time, at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when the peninsula came under Japanese protection. It was\r\nnever customary in Japan.\r\n\r\nBUILDING OF TEMPLES\r\n\r\nAfter order had been restored, Prince Shotoku fulfilled his vow by\r\nbuilding in the province of Settsu a temple dedicated to the Four\r\nGuardian Kings of Heaven (Shitenno-ji), and by way of endowment there\r\nwere handed over to it one-half of the servants of the o-muraji,\r\ntogether with his house and a quantity of other property. The o-omi,\r\nUmako, also erected a temple called Hoko-ji in Asuka near Kara. It\r\nhas been shown above that Soga no Iname converted one of his houses\r\ninto a temple to receive the Buddhist image sent by Myong in 552, and\r\nthat his son, Umako, erected a temple on the east of his residence to\r\nenshrine a stone image of Miroku, in 584. But these two edifices\r\npartook largely of the nature of private worship. The first public\r\ntemples for the service of Buddhism were Shotoku's Shitenno-ji and\r\nUmako's Hoko-ji erected in 587.\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF THE O-MURAJI'S PROPERTY\r\n\r\nIn the Annals of Prince Shotoku (Taishi-deri) it is recorded that the\r\nparts of the o-muraji's estate with which the temple of the Four\r\nKings was endowed were 273 members of his family and household; his\r\nthree houses and movable property, together with his domain measuring\r\n186,890 shiro, and consisting of two areas of 128,640 shiro and\r\n58,250 shiro in Kawachi and Settsu, respectively. The shiro is\r\nvariously reckoned at from 5% to 7.12 tsubo (1 tsubo = 36 square\r\nfeet). Taking the shiro as 6 tsubo, the above three areas total 1000\r\nacres approximately. That this represented a part only of the\r\no-muraji's property is held by historians, who point to the fact that\r\nthe o-omi's wife, a younger sister of the o-muraji, incited her\r\nhusband to destroy Moriya for the sake of getting possession of his\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR SUSHUN\r\n\r\nThe deaths of Prince Anahobe and Moriya left the Government\r\ncompletely in the hands of Soga no Umako. There was no o-muraji; the\r\no-omi was supreme. At his instance the crown was placed upon the head\r\nof his youngest nephew, Sushun. But Sushun entertained no friendship\r\nfor Umako nor any feeling of gratitude for the latter's action in\r\ncontriving his succession to the throne. Active, daring, and astute,\r\nhe judged the o-omi to be swayed solely by personal ambition, and he\r\nplaced no faith in the sincerity of the great official's Buddhist\r\npropaganda. Meanwhile, the fortunes of the new faith prospered. When\r\nthe dying Emperor, Yomei, asked to be qualified for Nirvana, priests\r\nwere summoned from Kudara. They came in 588, the first year of\r\nSushun's reign, carrying relics (sarira), and they were accompanied\r\nby ascetics, temple-architects, metal-founders, potters, and a\r\npictorial artist.\r\n\r\nThe Indian creed now began to present itself to the Japanese people,\r\nnot merely as a vehicle for securing insensibility to suffering in\r\nthis life and happiness in the next, but also as a great protagonist\r\nof refined progress, gorgeous in paraphernalia, impressive in rites,\r\neminently practical in teachings, and substituting a vivid rainbow of\r\npositive hope for the negative pallor of Shinto. Men began to adopt\r\nthe stole; women to take the veil, and people to visit the hills in\r\nsearch of timbers suited for the frames of massive temples. Soga no\r\nUmako, the ostensible leader of this great movement, grew more and\r\nmore arrogant and arbitrary. The youthful Emperor unbosomed himself\r\nto Prince Shotoku, avowing his aversion to the o-omi and his\r\nuncontrollable desire to be freed from the incubus of such a\r\nminister. Shotoku counselled patience, but Sushun's impetuosity could\r\nnot brook delay, nor did he reflect that he was surrounded by\r\npartisans of the Soga.\r\n\r\nA Court lady betrayed his designs to the o-omi, and the latter\r\ndecided that the Emperor must be destroyed. An assassin was found in\r\nthe person of Koma, a naturalized Chinese, suzerain of the Aya uji,\r\nand, being introduced into the palace by the o-omi under pretence of\r\noffering textile fabrics from the eastern provinces, he killed the\r\nEmperor. So omnipotent was the Soga chief that his murderous envoy\r\nwas not even questioned. He received open thanks from his employer\r\nand might have risen to high office had he not debauched a daughter\r\nof the o-omi. Then Umako caused him to be hung from a tree and made a\r\ntarget of his body, charging him with having taken the Emperor's\r\nlife. \"I knew only that there was an o-omi,\" retorted the man. \"I did\r\nnot know there was an Emperor.\" Many others shared Koma's comparative\r\nignorance when the Soga were in power. At the Emperor Yomei's death,\r\nonly one person honoured his memory by entering the Buddhist\r\npriesthood. When Soga no Umako died, a thousand men received the\r\ntonsure. The unfortunate Sushun was interred on the day of his\r\nmurder, an extreme indignity, yet no one ventured to protest; and\r\neven Prince Shotoku, while predicting that the assassin would\r\nultimately suffer retribution, justified the assassination on the\r\nground that previous misdeeds had deserved it.\r\n\r\nShotoku's conduct on this occasion has inspired much censure and\r\nsurprise when contrasted with his conspicuous respect for virtue in\r\nall other cases. But the history of the time requires intelligent\r\nexpansion. Cursory reading suggests that Umako's resolve to kill\r\nSushun was taken suddenly in consequence of discovering the latter's\r\nangry mood. The truth seems to be that Sushun was doomed from the\r\nmoment of his accession. His elder brother had perished at the hands\r\nof Umako's troops, and if he himself did not meet the same fate,\r\nabsence of plausible pretext alone saved him. To suffer him to reign,\r\nharbouring, as he must have harboured, bitter resentment against his\r\nbrother's slayer, would have been a weakness inconsistent with\r\nUmako's character. Sushun was placed on the throne as a concession to\r\nappearance, but, at the same time, he was surrounded with creatures\r\nof the o-omi, so that the latter had constant cognizance of the\r\nsovereign's every word and act.\r\n\r\nWhen the o-omi judged the time fitting, he proposed to the Emperor\r\nthat an expedition should be despatched to recover Mimana, which had\r\nbeen lost to Japan some time previously. An army of twenty thousand\r\nmen, commanded by a majority of the omi and muraji, was sent to\r\nTsukushi, and all potential opponents of the Soga chief having been\r\nthus removed, he proceeded to carry out his design against the\r\nEmperor's life. The very indignity done to Sushun's remains testifies\r\nthe thoroughness of the Soga plot. It has been shown that in early\r\ndays the erection of a tomb for an Imperial personage was a heavy\r\ntask, involving much time and labour. Pending the completion of the\r\nwork, the corpse was put into a coffin and guarded day and night, for\r\nwhich purpose a separate palace was* erected. When the sepulchre had\r\nbeen fully prepared, the remains were transferred thither with\r\nelaborate ceremonials,** and the tomb was thenceforth under the care\r\nof guardians (rioko).\r\n\r\n*Called Araki-no-miya, or the \"rough palace.\" The interval during\r\nwhich time the coffin remained there was termed kari-mo-gari, or\r\n\"temporary mourning.\"\r\n\r\n**Known as kakushi-matsuri, or the \"rite of hiding.\" It would seem\r\nthat the term of one year's mourning prescribed in the case of a\r\nparent had its origin in the above arrangement.\r\n\r\nAll these observances were dispensed with in the case of the Emperor\r\nSushun. His remains did not receive even the measure of respect that\r\nwould have been paid to the corpse of the commonest among his\r\nsubjects. Nothing could indicate more vividly the omnipotence of the\r\no-omi; everything had been prepared so that his partisans could bury\r\nthe body almost before it was cold. Had Prince Shotoku protested, he\r\nwould have been guilty of the futility described by a Chinese proverb\r\nas \"spitting at the sky.\" Besides, Shotoku and Umako were allies\r\notherwise. The Soga minister, in his struggle with the military\r\nparty, had needed the assistance of Shotoku, and had secured it by\r\ncommunity of allegiance to Buddhism. The prince, in his projected\r\nstruggle against the uji system, needed the assistance of Buddhist\r\ndisciples in general, and in his effort to reach the throne, needed\r\nthe assistance of Umako in particular. In short, he was building the\r\nedifice of a great reform, and to have pitted himself, at the age of\r\nnineteen, against the mature strength of the o-omi would have been to\r\nperish on the threshold of his purpose.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPRESS SUIKO\r\n\r\nBy the contrivance of Umako, the consort of the Emperor Bidatsu was\r\nnow placed on the throne, Prince Shotoku being nominated Prince\r\nImperial and regent. The Soga-uji held absolute power in every\r\ndepartment of State affairs.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF SHOTOKU\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable documents in Japanese annals is the\r\nJushichi Kempo, or Seventeen-Article Constitution, compiled by\r\nShotoku Taishi in A.D. 604. It is commonly spoken of as the first\r\nwritten law of Japan. But it is not a body of laws in the proper\r\nsense of the term. There are no penal provisions, nor is there any\r\nevidence of promulgation with Imperial sanction. The seventeen\r\narticles are simply moral maxims, based on the teachings of Buddhism\r\nand Confucianism, and appealing to the sanctions of conscience.\r\nPrince Shotoku, in his capacity of regent, compiled them and issued\r\nthem to officials in the guise of \"instructions.\"\r\n\r\nI. Harmony is to be valued, and the avoidance of wanton opposition\r\nhonoured. All men are swayed by class feeling and few are\r\nintelligent. Hence some disobey their lords and fathers or maintain\r\nfeuds with neighbouring villages. But when the high are harmonious\r\nand the low friendly, and when there is concord in the discussion of\r\naffairs, right views spontaneously find acceptance. What is there\r\nthat cannot be then accomplished?\r\n\r\nII. Reverence sincerely the Three Treasures--Buddha, the Law, and the\r\nPriesthood--for these are the final refuge of the Four Generated\r\nBeings* and the supreme objects of faith in all countries. What man\r\nin what age can fail to revere this law? Few are utterly bad: they\r\nmay be taught to follow it. But if they turn not to the Three\r\nTreasures, wherewithal shall their crookedness be made straight?\r\n\r\n*Beings produced in transmigration by the four processes of being\r\nborn from eggs, from a womb, from fermentation, or from\r\nmetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nIII. When you receive the Imperial Commands fail not to obey\r\nscrupulously. The lord is Heaven; the vassal, Earth. Heaven\r\noverspreads; Earth upbears. When this is so, the four seasons follow\r\ntheir due course, and the powers of Nature develop their efficiency.\r\nIf the Earth attempt to overspread, Heaven falls in ruin. Hence when\r\nthe lord speaks, the vassal hearkens; when the superior acts, the\r\ninferior yields compliance. When, therefore, you receive an Imperial\r\nCommand, fail not to carry it out scrupulously. If there be want or\r\ncare in this respect, a catastrophe naturally ensues.\r\n\r\nIV. Ministers and functionaries should make decorous behavior their\r\nguiding principle, for decorous behavior is the main factor in\r\ngoverning the people. If superiors do not behave with decorum,\r\ninferiors are disorderly; if inferiors are wanting in proper\r\nbehaviour, offences are inevitable. Thus it is that when lord and\r\nvassal behave with propriety, the distinctions of rank are not\r\nconfused; and when the people behave with propriety, the government\r\nof the State proceeds of itself.\r\n\r\nV. Refraining from gluttony and abandoning covetous desires, deal\r\nimpartially with the suits brought before you. Of complaints\r\npreferred by the people there are a thousand in one day: how many,\r\nthen, will there be in a series of years? Should he that decides\r\nsuits at law make gain his ordinary motive and hear causes with a\r\nview to receiving bribes, then will the suits of the rich man be like\r\na stone flung into water,* while the plaints of the poor will\r\nresemble water cast on a stone. In such circumstances, the poor man\r\nwill not know whither to betake himself, and the duty of a minister\r\nwill not be discharged.\r\n\r\n*That is to say, they will encounter no opposition.\r\n\r\nVI. Chastise that which is evil and encourage that which is good.\r\nThis was the excellent rule of antiquity. Conceal not, therefore, the\r\ngood qualities of others, and fail not to correct that which is wrong\r\nwhen you see it. Flatterers and deceivers are a sharp weapon for the\r\noverthrow of the State, and a pointed sword for the destruction of\r\nthe people. Sycophants are also fond, when they meet, of dilating to\r\ntheir superiors on the errors of their inferiors; to their inferiors,\r\nthey censure the faults of their superiors. Men of this kind are all\r\nwanting in fidelity to their lord, and in benevolence towards the\r\npeople. From such an origin great civil disturbances arise.\r\n\r\nVII. Let every man have his own charge, and let not the spheres of\r\nduty be confused. When wise men are entrusted with office, the sound\r\nof praise arises. If unprincipled men hold office, disasters and\r\ntumults are multiplied. In this world, few are born with knowledge:\r\nwisdom is the product of earnest meditation. In all things, whether\r\ngreat or small, find the right man, and they will surely be well\r\nmanaged: on all occasions, be they urgent or the reverse, meet with\r\nbut a wise man and they will of themselves be amenable. In this way\r\nwill the State be eternal and the Temples of the Earth and of Grain*\r\nwill be free from danger. Therefore did the wise sovereigns of\r\nantiquity seek the man to fill the office, and not the office for the\r\nsake of the man.\r\n\r\n*A Chinese expression for the Imperial house.\r\n\r\nVIII. Let the ministers and functionaries attend the Court early in\r\nthe morning, and retire late. The business of the State does not\r\nadmit of remissness, and the whole day is hardly enough for its\r\naccomplishment. If, therefore, the attendance at Court is late,\r\nemergencies cannot be met: if officials retire soon, the work cannot\r\nbe completed.\r\n\r\nIX. Good faith is the foundation of right. In everything let there be\r\ngood faith, for in it there surely consists the good and the bad,\r\nsuccess and failure. If the lord and the vassal observe good faith\r\none with another, what is there which cannot be accomplished? If the\r\nlord and the vassal do not observe good faith towards one another,\r\neverything without exception ends in failure.\r\n\r\nX. Let us cease from wrath, and refrain from angry looks. Nor let us\r\nbe resentful when others differ from us. For all men have hearts, and\r\neach heart has its own leanings. Their right is our wrong, and our\r\nright is their wrong. We are not unquestionably sages nor are they\r\nunquestionably fools. Both of us are simply ordinary men. How can\r\nanyone lay down a rule by which to distinguish right from wrong? For\r\nwe are all, one with another, wise and foolish like a ring which has\r\nno end. Therefore, although others give way to anger, let us, on the\r\ncontrary, dread our own faults, and though we alone may be in the\r\nright, let us follow the multitude and act like them.\r\n\r\nXI. Give clear appreciation to merit and demerit, and deal out to\r\neach its sure reward or punishment. In these days, reward does not\r\nattend upon merit, nor punishment upon crime. Ye high functionaries\r\nwho have charge of public affairs, let it be your task to make clear\r\nrewards and punishments.\r\n\r\nXII. Let not the provincial authorities or the kuni no miyatsuko levy\r\nexactions on the people. In a country there are not two lords; the\r\npeople have not two masters. The sovereign is the master of the\r\npeople of the whole country. The officials to whom he gives charge\r\nare all his vassals. How can they, as well as the Government, presume\r\nto levy taxes on the people?\r\n\r\nXIII. Let all persons entrusted with office attend equally to their\r\nfunctions. Owing to illness or despatch on missions their work may\r\nsometimes be neglected. But whenever they are able to attend to\r\nbusiness, let them be as accommodating as though they had cognizance\r\nof it from before, and let them not hinder public affairs on the\r\nscore of not having had to do with them.\r\n\r\nXIV. Ministers and functionaries, be not envious. If we envy others,\r\nthey, in turn, will envy us. The evils of envy know no limit. If\r\nothers excel us in intelligence, it gives us no pleasure; if they\r\nsurpass us in ability, we are envious. Therefore it is not until\r\nafter the lapse of five hundred years that we at last meet with a\r\nwise man, and even in a thousand years we hardly obtain one sage. But\r\nif wise men and sages be not found, how shall the country be\r\ngoverned?\r\n\r\nXV. To turn away from that which is private and to set one's face\r\ntowards that which is public this is the path of a minister. If a man\r\nis influenced by private motives, he will assuredly feel resentment;\r\nif he is influenced by resentment, he will assuredly fail to act\r\nharmoniously with others; if he fails to act harmoniously with\r\nothers, he will assuredly sacrifice the public interest to his\r\nprivate feelings. When resentment arises, it interferes with order\r\nand is subversive of law. Therefore, in the first clause it was said\r\nthat superiors and inferiors should agree together. The purport is\r\nthe same as this.\r\n\r\nXVI. Let the employment of the people in forced labour be at\r\nseasonable times. This is an ancient and excellent rule. Let them be\r\nemployed, therefore, in the winter months when they have leisure. But\r\nfrom spring to autumn, when they are engaged in agriculture or with\r\nthe mulberry trees, the people should not be employed. For if they do\r\nnot attend to agriculture, what will they have to eat? If they do not\r\nattend to the mulberry trees, what will they do for clothing?\r\n\r\nXVII. Decisions on important matters should not be rendered by one\r\nperson alone: they should be discussed by many. But small matters\r\nbeing of less consequence, need not be consulted about by a number of\r\npeople. It is only in the discussion of weighty affairs, when there\r\nis an apprehension of miscarriage, that matters should be arranged in\r\nconcert with others so as to arrive at the right conclusion.*\r\n\r\n*The above is taken almost verbatim from Aston's translation of the\r\nNihongi.\r\n\r\nFor a document compiled at the beginning of the seventh century these\r\nseventeen ethical precepts merit much approbation. With the exception\r\nof the doctrine of expediency, enunciated at the close of the tenth\r\narticle, the code of Shotoku might be taken for guide by any\r\ncommunity in any age. But the prince as a moral reformer* cannot be\r\ncredited with originality; his merit consists in having studied\r\nConfucianism and Buddhism intelligently. The political purport of his\r\ncode is more remarkable. In the whole seventeen articles there is\r\nnothing to inculcate worship of the Kami or observance of Shinto\r\nrites. Again, whereas, according to the Japanese creed, the sovereign\r\npower is derived from the Imperial ancestor, the latter is nowhere\r\nalluded to. The seventh article makes the eternity of the State and\r\nthe security of the Imperial house depend upon wise administration by\r\nwell-selected officials, but says nothing of hereditary rights. How\r\nis such a vital omission to be interpreted, except on the supposition\r\nthat Shotoku, who had witnessed the worst abuses incidental to the\r\nhereditary system of the uji, intended by this code to enter a solemn\r\nprotest against that system?\r\n\r\n*It is a curious fact that tradition represents this prince as having\r\nbeen born at the door of a stable. Hence his original name, Umayado\r\n(Stable-door).\r\n\r\nFurther, the importance attached to the people* is a very prominent\r\nfeature of the code. Thus, in Article IV, it is stated that \"when the\r\npeople behave with propriety the government of the State proceeds of\r\nitself;\" Article V speaks of \"complaints preferred by the people;\"\r\nArticle VI refers to \"the overthrow of the State\" and \"the\r\ndestruction of the people;\" Article VII emphasises \"the eternity of\r\nthe State;\" that \"the sovereign is the master of the people of the\r\nwhole country;\" that \"the officials to whom he gives charge are all\r\nhis vassals,\" and that these officials, whether miyatsuko or\r\nprovincial authorities, must not \"presume, as well as the Government,\r\nto levy taxes on the people.\" All those expressions amount to a\r\ndistinct condemnation of the uji system, under which the only people\r\ndirectly subject to the sovereign were those of the minashiro, and\r\nthose who had been naturalized or otherwise specially assigned, all\r\nthe rest being practically the property of the uji, and the only\r\nlands paying direct taxes to the Throne were the domains of the\r\nmiyake.\r\n\r\n*The word used is hyakusho, which ultimately came to be applied to\r\nfarmers only.\r\n\r\nForty-two years later (A.D. 646), the abolition of private property\r\nin persons and lands was destined to become the policy of the State,\r\nbut its foundations seem to have been laid in Shotoku's time. It\r\nwould be an error to suppose that the neglect of Shinto suggested by\r\nthe above code was by any means a distinct feature of the era, or\r\neven a practice of the prince himself. Thus, an Imperial edict,\r\npublished in the year 607, enjoined that there must be no remissness\r\nin the worship of the Kami, and that they should be sincerely\r\nreverenced by all officials, In the sequel of this edict Prince\r\nShotoku himself, the o-omi, and a number of functionaries worshipped\r\nthe Kami of heaven and of earth. In fact, Shotoku, for all his\r\nenthusiasm in the cause of Buddhism, seems to have shrunk from\r\nanything like bigoted exclusiveness. He is quoted* as saying: \"The\r\nmanagement of State affairs cannot be achieved unless it is based on\r\nknowledge, and the sources of knowledge are Confucianism, Buddhism,\r\nand Shinto.\"** He who inclines to one of these three, must study the\r\nother two also; for what one knows seems reasonable, but that of\r\nwhich one is ignorant appears unreasonable. Therefore an\r\nadministrator of public affairs should make himself acquainted with\r\nall three and should not affect one only, for such partiality\r\nsignifies maladministration.\r\n\r\n*In the Sankyo-ron.\r\n\r\n**The order of this enumeration is significant.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF SHOTOKU TAISHI\r\n\r\nPrince Shotoku died in the year 621. The Records do not relate\r\nanything of his illness: they say merely that he foresaw the day and\r\nhour of his own death, and they say also that when the Buddhist\r\npriest, Hyecha of Koma, who had instructed the prince in the \"inner\r\ndoctrine,\" learned of his decease, he also announced his\r\ndetermination to die on the same day of the same month in the\r\nfollowing year so as \"to meet the prince in the Pure Land and,\r\ntogether with him, pass through the metempsychosis of all living\r\ncreatures.\"\r\n\r\nThe last months of Shotoku's life were devoted to compiling, in\r\nconcert with the o-omi Umako, \"a history of the Emperors; a history\r\nof the country, and the original record of the omi, the muraji, the\r\ntomo no miyatsuko, the kuni no miyatsuko, the 180 be, and the free\r\nsubjects.\" This, the first Japanese historical work, was completed in\r\nthe year 620. It was known afterwards as the Kujihongi, and\r\ntwenty-five years later (645) when--as will presently be seen--the\r\nexecution of the Soga chief took place, the book was partially\r\nconsumed by fire. Yet that it had not suffered beyond the possibility\r\nof reconstruction, and that it survived in the Ko-jiki was never\r\ndoubted until the days (1730-1801) of \"the prince of Japanese\r\nliterati,\" Motoori Norinaga. The question of authenticity is still\r\nunsettled.\r\n\r\nShotoku's name is further connected with calendar making, though no\r\nparticulars of his work in that line are on record. Japanese\r\nhistorians speak of him as the father of his country's civilization.\r\nThey say that he breathed life into the nation; that he raised the\r\nstatus of the Empire; that he laid the foundations of Japanese\r\nlearning; that he fixed the laws of decorum; that he imparted a new\r\ncharacter to foreign relations, and that he was an incarnation of the\r\nBuddha, specially sent to convert Japan. The Chronicles say that at\r\nhis death nobles and commoners alike, \"the old, as if they had lost a\r\ndear child, the young, as if they had lost a beloved parent, filled\r\nthe ways with the sound of their lamenting.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SPREAD OF BUDDHISM AND THE CONTROL OF ITS PRIESTS\r\n\r\nThe roots of Japanese Buddhism were watered with blood, as have been\r\nthe roots of so many religions in so many countries. From the day of\r\nthe destruction of the military party under the o-muraji Moriya, the\r\nforeign faith flourished. Then--as has been shown--were built the\r\nfirst two great temples, and then, for the first time, a Buddhist\r\nplace of worship was endowed* with rich estates and an ample number\r\nof serfs to till them. Thenceforth the annals abound with references\r\nto the advent of Buddhist priests from Korea, bearing relics or\r\nimages. The omi and the muraji vied with each other in erecting\r\nshrines, and in 605, we find the Empress Suiko commanding all high\r\ndignitaries of State to make 16-foot images of copper** and of\r\nembroidery. Buddhist festivals were instituted in 606, and their\r\nmagnificence, as compared with the extreme simplicity of the Shinto\r\nrites, must have deeply impressed the people. In a few decades\r\nBuddhism became a great social power, and since its priests and nuns\r\nwere outside the sphere of ordinary administration, the question of\r\ntheir control soon presented itself. It became pressing in 623 when a\r\npriest killed his grandfather with an axe. The Empress Suiko, who was\r\nthen on the throne, would have subjected the whole body of priests\r\nand nuns to judicial examination, a terrible ordeal in those days of\r\ntorture; but at the instance of a Korean priest, officials\r\ncorresponding to bishops (sojo), high priests (sozu) and abbots\r\n(hotto) were appointed from the ranks of Buddhism, and the duty of\r\nprescribing law and order was entrusted to them. This involved\r\nregistration of all the priesthood, and it was thus found (623) that\r\nthe temples numbered 46; the priests 816, and the nuns 569.\r\n\r\n*The endowment of religious edifices was not new in Japan. A\r\nconspicuous instance was in A.D. 487, when rice-fields were dedicated\r\nto the Moon god and to the ancestor of the Sun goddess.\r\n\r\n**The metal employed was of gold and copper; in the proportion of one\r\npart of the former to 430 of the latter. It is related that when\r\nthese images were completed, the temple door proved too low to admit\r\nthem, and the artisan--Tori the Saddle-maker--whose ingenuity\r\novercame the difficulty without pulling down the door, received large\r\nhonour and reward.\r\n\r\nINTERCOURSE WITH CHINA\r\n\r\nThat not a few Chinese migrated to Japan in remote times is clear.\r\nThe Records show that in the year A.D. 540, during the reign of\r\nKimmei, immigrants from Tsin and Han were assembled and registered,\r\nwhen their number was found to be 7053 households. The terms \"Tsin\"\r\nand \"Han\" refer to Chinese dynasties of those names, whose sway\r\ncovered the period between 255 B.C. and A.D. 419. Hence the\r\nexpression is too vague to suggest any definite idea of the advent of\r\nthose settlers; but the story of some, who came through Korea, has\r\nalready been traced. It was in A.D. 552, during the reign of this\r\nsame Kimmei, that Buddhism may be said to have found a home in Japan.\r\nChina was then under the sceptre of the Liang dynasty, whose first\r\nsovereign, Wu, had been such an enthusiastic Buddhist that he\r\nabandoned the throne for a monastery.. Yet China took no direct part\r\nin introducing the Indian faith to Japan, nor does it appear that\r\nfrom the fourth century A.D. down to the days of Shotoku Taishi,\r\nJapan thought seriously of having recourse to China as the\r\nfountain-head of the arts, the crafts, the literature, and the moral\r\ncodes which she borrowed during the period from Korea.\r\n\r\nSomething of this want of enterprise may have been attributable to\r\nthe unsettled state of China's domestic politics; something to the\r\nwell-nigh perpetual troubles between Japan and Korea--troubles which\r\nnot only taxed Japan's resources but also blocked the sole route by\r\nwhich China was then accessible, namely, the route through Korea. But\r\nwhen the Sui dynasty (A.D. 589-619) came to the Chinese throne, its\r\nfounder, the Emperor Wen, on the one hand, devoted himself to\r\nencouraging literature and commerce; and on the other, threw Korea\r\nand Japan into a ferment by invading the former country at the head\r\nof a huge army.* This happened when Shotoku Taishi was in his\r\nsixteenth year, and though the great expedition proved abortive for\r\naggressive purposes, it brought China into vivid prominence, and when\r\nnews reached Japan of extensions of the Middle Kingdom's territories\r\nunder Wen's successor, the Japanese Crown Prince determined to open\r\ndirect intercourse with the Sui Court; not only for literary and\r\nreligious purposes, but also to study the form of civilization which\r\nthe whole Orient then revered. This resolve found practical\r\nexpression in the year 607, when the omi Imoko was sent as envoy to\r\nthe Sui Court, a Chinese of the Saddlers' Corporation, by name\r\nFukuri, being attached to him in the capacity of interpreter. China\r\nreceived these men hospitably and sent an envoy of her own, with a\r\nsuite of twelve persons, to the Yamato sovereign in the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n*Reputed to have mustered 300,000 strong.\r\n\r\nThe annals contain an instructive description of the ceremony\r\nconnected with the reception of this envoy in Japan. He was met in\r\nTsukushi (Kyushu) by commissioners of welcome, and was conducted\r\nthence by sea to Naniwa (now Osaka), where, at the mouth of the\r\nriver, thirty \"gaily-decked\" boats awaited him, and he and his suite\r\nwere conducted to a residence newly built for the occasion. Six weeks\r\nlater they entered the capital, after a message of welcome had been\r\ndelivered to them by a muraji. Seventy-five fully caparisoned horses\r\nwere placed at their disposal, and after a further rest of nine days,\r\nthe envoy's official audience took place. He did not see the Empress'\r\nface. Her Majesty was secluded in the hall of audience to which only\r\nthe principal ministers were admitted. Hence the ceremony may be said\r\nto have taken place in the court-yard. There the gifts brought by the\r\nenvoy were ranged, and the envoy himself, introduced by two high\r\nofficials, advanced to the front of the court, made obeisance twice,\r\nand, kneeling, declared the purport of his mission. The despatch\r\ncarried by him ran as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Emperor greets the sovereign of Wa.* Your envoy and his suite\r\nhave arrived and have given us full information. We, by the grace of\r\nheaven, rule over the universe. It is Our desire to diffuse abroad\r\nour civilizing influence so as to cover all living things, and Our\r\nsentiment of loving nurture knows no distinction of distance. Now We\r\nlearn that Your Majesty, dwelling separately beyond the sea, bestows\r\nthe blessings of peace on Your subjects; that there is tranquillity\r\nwithin Your borders, and that the customs and manners are mild. With\r\nthe most profound loyalty You have sent Us tribute from afar, and We\r\nare delighted at this admirable token of Your sincerity. Our health\r\nis as usual, notwithstanding the increasing heat of the weather.\r\nTherefore We have sent Pei Shieh-ching, Official Entertainer of the\r\nDepartment charged with the Ceremonial for the Reception of Foreign\r\nAmbassadors, and his suite, to notify to you the preceding. We also\r\ntransmit to you the products of which a list is given separately.**\r\n\r\n*It has already been stated that Japan was generally known in China\r\nand Korea by the term \"Wa,\" which, being written with an ideograph\r\nsignifying \"dwarf\" or \"subservient,\" was disliked by the Japanese.\r\nThe envoy sent from Yamato in 607 was instructed to ask for the\r\nsubstitution of Nippon (Place of Sunrise), but the Sui sovereign\r\ndeclined to make the change and Japan did not receive the designation\r\n\"Nippon\" in China until the period Wu Teh (A.D. 618-626) of the Tang\r\ndynasty. It is not certain at what time exactly the Japanese\r\nthemselves adopted this nomenclature, but it certainly was before the\r\nseventh century.\r\n\r\n**Translated by Aston in the Nihongi.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading of the document was concluded, a high noble stepped\r\nforward, took it from the envoy's hands and advanced with it towards\r\nthe audience-hall, from which another noble came out to meet him,\r\nreceived the letter, deposited it on a table before the chief\r\nentrance, and then reported the facts to the Empress. This ended the\r\nceremony. The haughty condescension of the Chinese despatch does not\r\nappear to have offended the Japanese, nor did they cavil at the\r\nomission of one important ideograph from the title applied to their\r\nEmpress. China's greatness seems to have been fully recognized. When,\r\na month later, the envoy took his departure, the same Imoko was\r\ndeputed to accompany him, bearing a despatch* in which, to China's\r\nsimple \"greeting,\" Japan returned a \"respectful address;\" to China's\r\nexpression of ineffable superiority Japan replied that the coming of\r\nthe embassy had \"dissolved her long-harboured cares;\" and to China's\r\ngrandiloquent prolixity Japan made answer with half a dozen brief\r\nlines. Imoko was now accompanied by eight students four of literature\r\nand four of religion. Thus was established, and for long afterwards\r\nmaintained, a bridge over which the literature, arts, ethics, and\r\nphilosophies of China were copiously imported into Japan.\r\n\r\n*In this despatch Japan called herself \"the place where the sun comes\r\nforth,\" and designated China as \"the place where the sun sets.\" The\r\nidea, doubtless, was merely to distinguish between east and west, but\r\nthe Sui sovereign resented the diction of this \"barbarian letter.\"\r\n\r\nRANKS\r\n\r\nIt will be recognized by considering the uji system that while many\r\ntitles existed in Japan, there was practically no promotion. A man\r\nmight be raised to uji rank. Several instances of that kind have been\r\nnoted, especially in the case of foreign artists or artisans\r\nmigrating to the island from Korea or China. But nothing higher was\r\nwithin reach, and for the hereditary Kami of an uji no reward offered\r\nexcept a gift of land, whatever services he might render to the\r\nState. Such a system could not but tend to perfunctoriness in the\r\ndischarge of duty. Perception of this defect induced the regent,\r\nShotoku, to import from China (A.D. 603) the method of official\r\npromotion in vogue under the Sui dynasty and to employ caps as\r\ninsignia of rank.* Twelve of such grades were instituted, and the\r\nterminology applied to them was based on the names of six moral\r\nqualities--virtue, benevolence, propriety, faith, justice, and\r\nknowledge--each comprising two degrees, \"greater\" and \"lesser.\" The\r\ncaps were made of sarcenet, a distinctive colour for each grade, the\r\ncap being gathered upon the crown in the shape of a bag with a border\r\nattached. The three highest ranks of all were not included in this\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\n*In China to-day the distinguishing mark is a button of varying\r\nmaterial fastened on the top of the cap.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR JOMEI AND THE EMPRESS KOGYOKU\r\n\r\nIn the year 626, the omnipotent Soga chief, the o-omi Umako, died.\r\nHis brief eulogy in the Chronicles is that he had \"a talent for\r\nmilitary tactics,\" was \"gifted with eloquence,\" and deeply reverenced\r\n\"the Three Precious Things\" (Buddha, Dharma, and Samgha). In the\r\ncourt-yard of his residence a pond was dug with a miniature island in\r\nthe centre, and so much attention did this innovation attract that\r\nthe great minister was popularly called Shima (island) no o-omi. His\r\noffice of o-omi was conferred on his son, Emishi, who behaved with\r\neven greater arrogance and arbitrariness than his father had shown.\r\nThe Empress Suiko died in 628, and the question of the accession at\r\nonce became acute. Two princes were eligible; Tamura, grandson of the\r\nEmperor Bidatsu, and Yamashiro, son of Shotoku Taishi. Prince\r\nYamashiro was a calm, virtuous, and faithful man. He stated\r\nexplicitly that the Empress, on the eve of her demise, had nominated\r\nhim to be her successor. But Prince Tamura had the support of the\r\no-omi, Emishi, whose daughter he admired. No one ventured to oppose\r\nthe will of the Soga chieftain except Sakaibe no Marise, and he with\r\nhis son were ruthlessly slain by the orders of the o-omi.\r\n\r\nPrince Tamura then (629) ascended the throne--he is known in history\r\nas Jomei--but Soga no Emishi virtually ruled the empire. Jomei died\r\nin 641, after a reign of twelve years, and by the contrivance of\r\nEmishi the sceptre was placed in the hands of an Empress, Kogyoku, a\r\ngreat-granddaughter of the Emperor Bidatsu, the claims of the son of\r\nShotoku Taishi being again ignored. One of the first acts of the new\r\nsovereign was to raise Emishi to the rank held by his father, the\r\nrank of o-omi, and there then came into prominence Emishi's son,\r\nIruka, who soon wielded power greater than even that possessed by his\r\nfather. Iruka's administration, however, does not appear to have been\r\naltogether unwholesome. The Chronicles say that \"thieves and robbers\r\nwere in dread of him, and that things dropped on the highway were not\r\npicked up.\" But Emishi rendered himself conspicuous chiefly by aping\r\nImperial state. He erected an ancestral temple; organized\r\nperformances of a Chinese dance (yatsura) which was essentially an\r\nImperial pageant; levied imposts on the people at large for the\r\nconstruction of tombs--one for himself, another for his son,\r\nIruka--which were openly designated misasagi (Imperial sepulchres);\r\ncalled his private residence mikado (sacred gate); conferred on his\r\nchildren the title of miko (august child), and exacted forced labour\r\nfrom all the people of the Kamutsumiya estate, which belonged to the\r\nShotoku family.\r\n\r\nThis last outrage provoked a remonstrance from Shotoku Taishi's\r\ndaughter, and she was thenceforth reckoned among the enemies of the\r\nSoga. One year later (643), this feud ended in bloodshed. Emishi's\r\nusurpation of Imperial authority was carried so far that he did not\r\nhesitate to confer the rank of o-omi on his son, Iruka, and upon the\r\nlatter's younger brother also. Iruka now conceived the design of\r\nplacing upon the throne Prince Furubito, a son of the Emperor Jomei.\r\nIt will be remembered that the Soga chief, Emishi, had lent his\r\nomnipotent influence to secure the sceptre for Jomei, because of the\r\nlatter's affection for Emishi's daughter. This lady, having become\r\none of Jomei's consorts, had borne to him Prince Furubito, who was\r\nconsequently Iruka's uncle. Iruka determined that the prince should\r\nsucceed the Empress Kogyoku. To that end it was necessary to remove\r\nthe Shotoku family, against which, as shown above, the Soga had also\r\na special grudge. Not even the form of devising a protest was\r\nobserved. Orders were simply issued to a military force that the\r\nShotoku house should be extirpated. Its representative was Prince\r\nYamashiro, the same who had effaced himself so magnanimously at the\r\ntime of Jomei's accession. He behaved with ever greater nobility on\r\nthis occasion. Having by a ruse escaped from the Soga troops, he was\r\nurged by his followers to flee to the eastern provinces, and there\r\nraising an army, to march back to the attack of the Soga.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to think that this policy would have succeeded. But\r\nthe prince replied: \"I do not wish it to be said by after generations\r\nthat, for my sake, anyone has mourned the loss of a father or a\r\nmother. Is it only when one has conquered in battle that one is to be\r\ncalled a hero? Is he not also a hero who has made firm his country at\r\nthe expense of his own life?\" He then returned to the temple at\r\nIkaruga, which his father had built, and being presently besieged\r\nthere by the Soga forces, he and the members of his family,\r\ntwenty-three in all, committed suicide. This tragedy shocked even\r\nEmishi. He warned Iruka against the peril of such extreme measures.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FUJIWARA KAMATAKI\r\n\r\nThere now appears a statesman destined to leave his name indelibly\r\nwritten on the pages of Japanese history, Kamatari, muraji of the\r\nNakatomi-uji. The Nakatomi's functions were specially connected with\r\nShinto rites, and Kamatari must be supposed to have entertained\r\nlittle good-will towards the Soga, who were the leaders of the\r\nBuddhist faction, and whose feud with the military party sixty-seven\r\nyears previously had involved the violent death of Katsumi, then\r\n(587) muraji of the Nakatomi. Moreover, Kamatari makes his first\r\nappearance in the annals as chief Shinto official. Nevertheless, it\r\nis not apparent that religious zeal or personal resentment was\r\nprimarily responsible for Kamatari's determination to compass the\r\nruin of the Soga. Essentially an upright man and a loyal subject, he\r\nseems to have been inspired by a frank resolve to protect the Throne\r\nagainst schemes of lawless ambitions, unconscious that his own\r\nfamily, the Fujiwara, were destined to repeat on a still larger scale\r\nthe same abuses.\r\n\r\nThe succession may be said to have had three aspirants at that time:\r\nfirst, Prince Karu, younger brother of the Empress Kogyoku; secondly,\r\nPrince Naka, her son, and thirdly, Prince Furubito, uncle of Soga no\r\nIruka. The last was, of course, excluded from Kamatari's\r\ncalculations, and as between the first two he judged it wiser that\r\nPrince Karu should have precedence in the succession, Prince Naka not\r\nbeing old enough. The conspiracy that ensued presents no specially\r\nremarkable feature. Kamatari and Prince Naka became acquainted\r\nthrough an incident at the game of football, when the prince, having\r\naccidently kicked off his shoe, Kamatari picked it up and restored it\r\nto him on bended knee. The two men, in order to find secret\r\nopportunities for maturing their plans, became fellow students of the\r\ndoctrines of Chow and Confucius under the priest Shoan, who had been\r\namong the eight students that accompanied the Sui envoy on his return\r\nto China in the year 608.\r\n\r\nIntimate relations were cemented with a section of the Soga through\r\nKurayamada, whose daughter Prince Naka married, and trustworthy\r\nfollowers having been attached to the prince, the conspirators\r\nwatched for an occasion. It was not easy to find one. The Soga\r\nmansion, on the eastern slope of Mount Unebi, was a species of\r\nfortress, surrounded by a moat and provided with an armoury having\r\nample supply of bows and arrows. Emishi, the o-omi, always had a\r\nguard of fifty soldiers when he went abroad, and Iruka, his son, wore\r\na sword \"day and night.\" Nothing offered except to convert the palace\r\nitself into a place of execution. On the twelfth day of the sixth\r\nmonth, 645, the Empress held a Court in the great hall of audience to\r\nreceive memorials and tribute from the three kingdoms of Korea. All\r\npresent, except her Majesty and Iruka, were privy to the plot. Iruka\r\nhaving been beguiled into laying aside his sword, the reading of the\r\nmemorials was commenced by Kurayamada, and Prince Naka ordered the\r\ntwelve gates to be closed simultaneously. At that signal, two\r\nswordsmen should have advanced and fallen upon Iruka; but they showed\r\nthemselves so timorous that Prince Naka himself had to lead them to\r\nthe attack. Iruka, severely wounded, struggled to the throne and\r\nimplored for succour and justice; but when her Majesty in terror\r\nasked what was meant, Prince Naka charged Iruka with attempting to\r\nusurp the sovereignty. The Empress, seeing that her own son led the\r\nassassins, withdrew at once, and the work of slaughtering Iruka was\r\ncompleted, his corpse being thrown into the court-yard, where it lay\r\ncovered with straw matting.\r\n\r\nPrince Naka and Karaatari had not been so incautious as to take a\r\nwide circle of persons into their confidence. But they were\r\nimmediately joined by practically all the nobility and high\r\nofficials, and the o-omi's troops having dispersed without striking a\r\nblow, Emishi and his people were all executed. The Empress Kogyoku at\r\nonce abdicated in favour of her brother, Prince Kara, her son, Prince\r\nNaka, being nominated Prince Imperial. Her Majesty had worn the\r\npurple for only three years. All this was in accord with Kamatari's\r\ncarefully devised plans. They were epoch making.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH KOREA DURING THE SEVEN REIGNS FROM KIMMEI TO KOGYOKU\r\n(A.D. 540-645)\r\n\r\nThe story of Japan's relations with Korea throughout the period of\r\nover a century, from the accession of Kimmei (540) to the abdication\r\nof Kogyoku (645), is a series of monotonously similar chapters, the\r\nresult for Japan being that she finally lost her position at Mimana.\r\nThere was almost perpetual fighting between the petty kingdoms which\r\nstruggled for mastery in the peninsula, and Kudara, always nominally\r\nfriendly to Japan, never hesitated to seek the latter's assistance\r\nagainst Shiragi and Koma. To these appeals the Yamato Court lent a\r\nnot-unready ear, partly because they pleased the nation's vanity, but\r\nmainly because Kudara craftily suggested danger to Mimana unless\r\nJapan asserted herself with arms. But when it came to actually\r\nrendering material aid, Japan did nothing commensurate with her\r\ngracious demeanour. She seems to have been getting weary of expensive\r\ninterference, and possibly it may also have occurred to her that no\r\nvery profound sympathy was merited by a sovereign who, like the King\r\nof Kudara, preferred to rely on armed aid from abroad rather than\r\nrisk the loss of his principality to his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nAt all events, in answer to often iterated entreaties from Kudara,\r\nthe Yamato Court did not make any practical response until the year\r\n551, when it sent five thousand koku of barley-seed (?), followed,\r\ntwo years later, by two horses, two ships, fifty bows with arrows,\r\nand--a promise. Kudara was then ruled by a very enterprising prince\r\n(Yo-chang). Resolving to strike separately at his enemies, Koma and\r\nShiragi, he threw himself with all his forces against Koma and gained\r\na signal victory (553). Then, at length, Japan was induced to assist.\r\nAn omi was despatched (554) to the peninsula with a thousand\r\nsoldiers, as many horses and forty ships. Shiragi became at once the\r\nobjective of the united forces of Kudara and Japan. A disastrous\r\ndefeat resulted for the assailants. The Kudara army suffered almost\r\ncomplete extermination, losing nearly thirty thousand men, and\r\nhistory is silent as to the fate of the omi's contingent.\r\nNevertheless the fear of Japanese vengeance induced Shiragi to hold\r\nits hand, and, in the year 561, an attempt was made twice to renew\r\nfriendly relations with the Yamato Court by means of tribute-bearing\r\nenvoys. Japan did not repel these overtures, but she treated the\r\nenvoy of the victorious Shiragi with less respect than that extended\r\nto the envoy of the vanquished Kudara.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year (562), Shiragi invaded Mimana,\r\ndestroyed the Japanese station there and overran the whole region\r\n(ten provinces). No warning had reached Japan. She was taken entirely\r\nunawares, and she regarded it as an act of treachery on Shiragi's\r\npart to have transformed itself suddenly from a tribute-bearing\r\nfriend into an active enemy. Strangely enough, the King of Shiragi\r\ndoes not appear to have considered that his act precluded a\r\ncontinuance of friendly relations with the Yamato Court. Six months\r\nafter his invasion of Mimana he renewed the despatch of envoys to\r\nJapan, and it was not until their arrival in Yamato that they learned\r\nJapan's mood. Much to the credit of the Yamato Court, it did not\r\nwreak vengeance on these untimely envoys, but immediately afterwards\r\nan armed expedition was despatched to call Shiragi to account. The\r\nforces were divided into two corps, one being ordered to march under\r\nKi no Omaro northwest from Mimana and effect a junction with Kudara;\r\nthe other, under Kawabe no Nie, was to move eastward against Shiragi.\r\nThis scheme became known to the Shiragi generals owing to the seizure\r\nof a despatch intended for Kudara. They attempted to intercept\r\nOmaro's corps, but were signally defeated.\r\n\r\nThe movement under Kawabe no Nie fared differently. Japanese annals\r\nattempt to palliate his discomfiture by a story about the abuse of a\r\nflag of truce, but the fact seems to have been that Kawabe no Nie was\r\nan incompetent and pusillanimous captain. He and his men were all\r\nkilled or taken prisoners, the only redeeming feature being the\r\nintrepidity of a Japanese officer, Tsugi no Ikina, who, with his wife\r\nand son, endured to be tortured and killed rather than utter an\r\ninsult against their country.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to interpret the sequence of events after this\r\ncatastrophe. Japan immediately despatched a strong army--from thirty\r\nto forty thousand men--but instead of directing it against Shiragi,\r\nsent it to the attack of Koma, under advice of the King of Kudara.\r\nPossibly the idea may have been to crush Koma, and having thus\r\nisolated Shiragi, to deal with the latter subsequently. If so, the\r\nplan never matured. Koma, indeed, suffered a signal defeat at the\r\nhands of the Japanese, Satehiko, muraji of the Otomo, but Shiragi\r\nremained unmolested, and nothing accrued to Japan except some\r\nattractive spoils--curtains of seven-fold woof, an iron house, two\r\nsuits of armour, two gold-mounted swords, three copper belts with\r\nchasings, two variously coloured flags, and two beautiful women. Even\r\nas to the ultimate movements of Satehiko and his army the annals are\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThings remained thus for nine years. Tribute-bearing envoys arrived\r\nat intervals from Koma, but with Shiragi there was no communication.\r\nAt last, in 571, an official was sent to demand from Shiragi an\r\nexplanation of the reasons for the destruction of Mimana. The\r\nintention may have been to follow up this formality with the\r\ndespatch of an effective force, but within a month the Emperor\r\nKimmei died. On his death-bed he is said to have taken the Prince\r\nImperial--Bidatsu--by the hand and said: \"That which comes after\r\ndevolves on thee. Thou must make war on Shiragi and establish Mimana\r\nas a feudal dependency, renewing a relationship like that of husband\r\nand wife, just as it was in former days. If this be done, in my grave\r\nI shall rest content.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve years passed before Bidatsu took any step to comply with this\r\ndying injunction. During that long interval there were repeated\r\nenvoys from Koma, now a comparatively feeble principality, and\r\nShiragi made three unsuccessful overtures to renew amicable\r\nrelations. At length, in 583, the Emperor announced his intention of\r\ncarrying out the last testament of his predecessor. To that end his\r\nMajesty desired to consult with a Japanese, Nichira, who had served\r\nfor many years at the Kudara Court and was thoroughly familiar with\r\nthe conditions existing in Korea. Nichira came to Japan, but the\r\nannals indicate that his counsels were directed wholly against\r\nKudara, which was ostensibly on the friendliest terms with Japan, and\r\nnot at all against Shiragi, whose punishment was alone in question.\r\nBesides, instead of advising an appeal to arms, he urged the\r\nnecessity of developing Japan's material resources, so that her\r\nneighbours might learn to count her formidable and her people might\r\nacquire ardour in her cause. Whether the wisdom of this advice\r\nappealed to Bidatsu, or whether the disputes consequent upon the\r\nintroduction of Buddhism paralyzed his capacity for oversea\r\nenterprise, he made no further attempt to resolve the Korean problem.\r\n\r\nIn the year 591, the ill-fated Emperor Sushun conceived the idea of\r\nsending a large army to re-establish his country's prestige in the\r\npeninsula, but his own assassination intervened, and for the space of\r\nnine years the subject was not publicly revived. Then, in 600, the\r\nEmpress Suiko being on the throne, a unique opportunity presented\r\nitself. War broke out between Shiragi and Mimana. The Yamato Court at\r\nonce despatched a force of ten thousand men to Mimana's aid, and\r\nShiragi, having suffered a signal defeat, made act of abject\r\nsubmission, restoring to Mimana six of its original provinces and\r\npromising solemnly to abstain from future hostilities. The Japanese\r\ncommitted the error of crediting Shiragi's sincerity. They withdrew\r\ntheir forces, but no sooner had their ships passed below the horizon\r\nthan Shiragi once more invaded Mimana. It seemed at this juncture as\r\nthough the stars in their courses fought against Japan. Something,\r\nindeed, must be ascribed to her own methods of warfare which appear\r\nto have been overmerciful for the age. Thus, with the bitter\r\nexperience of Shiragi's treachery fresh in her recollection, she did\r\nnot execute a Shiragi spy seized in Tsushima, but merely banished him\r\nto the province of Kozuke. Still, she must be said to have been the\r\nvictim of special ill-fortune when an army of twenty-five thousand\r\nmen, assembled in Tsukushi for the invasion of Shiragi, was twice\r\nprevented from sailing by unforseeable causes, one being the death of\r\nPrince Kume, its commander-in-chief; the other, the death of the\r\nconsort of his successor, Prince Taema.*\r\n\r\n*Early Japanese history furnishes several examples showing that wives\r\noften accompanied their husbands on campaigns.\r\n\r\nThese things happened in the year 603, and for the next five years\r\nall relations with Korea seem to have been severed. Then (608) a\r\nbrief paragraph in the Chronicles records that \"many persons from\r\nShiragi came to settle in Japan.\" It is certainly eloquent of the\r\nYamato Court's magnanimity that it should have welcomed immigrants\r\nfrom a country with which it was virtually at war. Two years later\r\n(610), Shiragi and Mimana, acting in concert, sent envoys who were\r\nreceived with all the pomp and ceremony prescribed by Shotoku\r\nTaishi's code of decorum. Apparently this embassy was allowed to\r\nserve as a renewal of friendly relations, but it is not on record\r\nthat the subject of former dispute was alluded to in any way, nor was\r\nthe old-time habit of annual tribute-bearing envoys revived. Visitors\r\nfrom Korea were, indeed, few and far-between, as when, in 616,\r\nShiragi sent a golden image of Buddha, two feet high, whose\r\neffulgence worked wonders; or in 618, when an envoy from Korea\r\nconveyed the important tidings that the invasion of the peninsula by\r\nthe Sui sovereign, Yang, at the head of three hundred thousand men,\r\nhad been beaten back. This envoy carried to Yamato presents in the\r\nform of two captive Chinese, a camel, and a number of flutes,\r\ncross-bows, and catapults (of which instruments of war mention is\r\nthus made for the first time in Japanese history).\r\n\r\nThe Yamato Court had evidently now abandoned all idea of punishing\r\nShiragi or restoring the station at Mimana; while Shiragi, on her\r\nside, was inclined to maintain friendly relations though she did not\r\nseek frequent intercourse. After an interval of five years'\r\naloofness, she presented (621) a memorial on an unrecorded subject,\r\nand in the following year, she presented, once more, a gold image of\r\nBuddha, a gold pagoda, and a number of baptismal flags.* But Shiragi\r\nwas nothing if not treacherous, and, even while making these valuable\r\npresents to the Yamato Court, and while despatching envoys in company\r\nwith those from Mimana, she was planning another invasion of the\r\nlatter. It took place that very year (622). When the news reached\r\nJapan, the Empress Suiko would have sent an envoy against Shiragi,\r\nbut it was deemed wiser to employ diplomacy in the first place, for\r\nthe principalities of Korea were now in close relations with the\r\ngreat Tang dynasty of China and might even count on the latter's\r\nprotection in case of emergency.\r\n\r\n*\"The Buddhist baptism consists in washing the top of the head with\r\nperfumed water. The baptismal flags were so called because they had\r\nthe same efficiency, raising those who passed under them, first, to\r\nthe rank of Tchakra Radja, and, ultimately, to that of a Buddha.\"\r\n(Aston.)\r\n\r\nTwo plenipotentiaries were therefore sent from Japan. Their mission\r\nproved very simple. Shiragi acquiesced in all their proposals and\r\npledged herself once for all to recognize Mimana as a dependency of\r\nJapan. But after the despatch of these plenipotentiaries, the\r\nwar-party in Japan had gained the ascendancy, and just as the\r\nplenipotentiaries, accompanied by tribute-bearing envoys from Shiragi\r\nand Mimana, were about to embark for Japan, they were astounded by\r\nthe apparition of a great flotilla carrying thousands of armed men.\r\nThe exact dimensions of this force are not on record: it is merely\r\ndescribed as having consisted of \"several tens of thousands of men,\"\r\nbut as it was commanded by two generals of the first rank and seven\r\nof the second, it must have been a very formidable army, and nothing\r\nis more remarkable about it than that it was assembled and embarked\r\nin the space of a few weeks. Shiragi did not attempt to resist. The\r\nKing tendered his submission and it was accepted without a blow\r\nhaving been struck. But there were no tangible results. Japan did not\r\nattempt to re-establish her miyake in Mimana, and Shiragi refrained\r\nfrom sending envoys to Yamato except on special occasions. Friendly,\r\nthough not intimate, relations were still maintained with the three\r\nkingdoms of Korea, mainly because the peninsula long continued to be\r\nthe avenue by which the literature, arts, and crafts of China under,\r\nthe Tang dynasty found their way to Japan. Since, however, the office\r\nin Mimana no longer existed to transact business connected with this\r\nintercourse, and since Yamato was too distant from the port of\r\ndeparture and arrival--Anato, now Nagato--a new office was\r\nestablished in Tsukushi (Kyushu) under the name of the Dazai-fu.\r\n\r\nLESSONS TAUGHT BY THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN JAPAN AND KOREA\r\n\r\nThe record of Japan's relations with Korea, so far as it has been\r\ncarried above--namely, to the close of the Empress Kogyoku's reign\r\n(A.D. 645)--discloses in the Korean people a race prone to\r\nself-seeking feuds, never reluctant to import foreign aid into\r\ndomestic quarrels, and careless of the obligations of good faith. In\r\nthe Japanese we see a nation magnanimous and trustful but of\r\naggressive tendencies.\r\n\r\nIMPORTATION OF CHINESE CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nAlthough Japan's military influence on the neighbouring continent\r\nwaned perceptibly from the reign of Kimmei (540-571) onwards, a\r\nstream of Chinese civilization flowed steadily into the Island Empire\r\nfrom the west, partly coming direct from the fountain head; partly\r\nfiltering, in a more or less impure form, through Korean channels.\r\nMany of the propagandists of this civilization remained permanently\r\nin Japan, where they received a courteous welcome, being promoted to\r\npositions of trust and admitted to the ranks of the nobility. Thus a\r\nbook (the Seishi-roku), published in 814, which has been aptly termed\r\nthe \"peerage of Japan,\" shows that, at that time, nearly one-third of\r\nthe Japanese nobility traced their descent to Chinese or Korean\r\nancestors in something like equal proportions. The numbers are,\r\nChina, 162 families; Kudara, 104; Koma, 50; Mimana, 9; Shiragi, 9;\r\ndoubtful, 47. Total, 381 Chinese and Korean families out of a grand\r\naggregate of 1177. But many of the visitors returned home after\r\nhaving sojourned for a time as teachers of literature, art, or\r\nindustrial science.\r\n\r\nThis system of brief residence for purposes of instruction seems to\r\nhave been inaugurated during the reign of Keitai, in the year 513,\r\nwhen Tan Yang-i, a Chinese expounder of the five classics, was\r\nbrought to Yamato by envoys from Kudara as a gift valued enough to\r\npurchase political intervention for the restoration of lost\r\nterritory; and when, three years later, a second embassy from the\r\nsame place, coming to render thanks for effective assistance in the\r\nmatter of the territory, asked that Tan might be allowed to return in\r\nexchange for another Chinese pundit, Ko An-mu. The incident suggests\r\nhow great was the value attached to erudition even in those remote\r\ndays. Yet this promising precedent was not followed for nearly forty\r\nyears, partly owing to the unsettled nature of Japan's relations.\r\nwith Korea.\r\n\r\nAfter the advent of Buddhism (552), however, Chinese culture found\r\nnew expansion eastward. In 554, there arrived from Kudara another\r\nChinese literatus, and, by desire of the Emperor, Kimmei, a party of\r\nexperts followed shortly afterwards, including a man learned in the\r\ncalendar, a professor of divination, a physician, two herbalists, and\r\nfour musicians. The record says that these men, who, with the\r\nexception of the Chinese doctor of literature, were all Koreans, took\r\nthe place of an equal number of their countrymen who had resided in\r\nJapan for some years. Thenceforth such incidents were frequent. Yet,\r\nat first, a thorough knowledge of the ideographic script seems to\r\nhave spread very slowly in Japan, for in 572, when the Emperor\r\nBidatsu sought an interpretation of a memorial presented by the Koma\r\nsovereign, only one man among all the scribes (fumi-bito), and he\r\n(Wang Sin-i) of Chinese origin, was found capable of reading the\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nBut from the accession of the Empress Suiko (593), the influence of\r\nShotoku Taishi made itself felt in every branch of learning, and\r\nthenceforth China and Japan may be said to have stood towards each\r\nother in the relation of teacher and pupil. Literature, the\r\nideographic script,* calendar compiling, astronomy, geography,\r\ndivination, magic, painting, sculpture, architecture, tile-making,\r\nceramics, the casting of metal, and other crafts were all cultivated\r\nassiduously under Chinese and Korean instruction. In architecture,\r\nall substantial progress must be attributed to Buddhism, for\r\nit was by building temples and pagodas that Japanese ideas of\r\ndwelling-houses were finally raised above the semi-subterranean type,\r\nand to the same influence must be attributed signal and rapid\r\nprogress in the art of interior decoration. The style of architecture\r\nadopted in temples was a mixture of the Chinese and the Indian.\r\nIndeed, it is characteristic of this early epoch that traces of the\r\narchitectural and glyptic fashions of the land where Buddhism was\r\nborn showed themselves much more conspicuously than they did in later\r\neras; a fact which illustrates Japan's constant tendency to break\r\naway from originals by modifying them in accordance with her own\r\nideals.\r\n\r\n*The oldest ideographic inscription extant in Japan is carved on a\r\nstone in Iyo province dating from A.D. 596. Next in point of\r\nantiquity is an inscription on the back of an image of Yakushi which\r\nstands in the temple Horyu-ji. It is ascribed to the year A.D. 607.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THE KONDO, HALL or THE HORYU-JI TEMPLE (Ji means temple)\r\n\r\nNone of the religious edifices then constructed has survived in its\r\nintegrity to the present day. One, however,--the Horyu-ji, at\r\nNara--since all its restorations have been in strict accord with\r\ntheir originals, is believed to be a true representative of the most\r\nancient type. It was founded by Shotoku Taishi and completed in 607.\r\nAt the time of its construction, this Horyu-ji was the chief academy\r\nof Buddhist teaching, and it therefore received the name of\r\nGakumon-ji (Temple of Learning). Among its treasures is an image of\r\ncopper and gold which was cast by the Korean artist, Tori--commonly\r\ncalled Tori Busshi, or Tori the image-maker--to order of Shotoku; and\r\nthere is mural decoration from the brush of a Korean priest, Doncho.\r\nThis building shows that already in the seventh century an imposing\r\ntype of wooden edifice had been elaborated--an edifice differing from\r\nthose of later epochs in only a few features; as, slight inequality\r\nin the scantling of its massive pillars; comparatively gentle pitch\r\nof roof; abnormally overhanging eaves, and shortness of distance\r\nbetween each storey of the pagoda. These sacred buildings were roofed\r\nwith tiles, and were therefore called kawara-ya (tiled house) by way\r\nof distinction, for all private dwellings, the Imperial palace not\r\nexcepted, continued to have thatched roofs in the period now under\r\nconsideration,* or at best roofs covered with boards. The annals show\r\nthat when the Empress Kogyoku built the Asuka palace, timber was\r\nobtained from several provinces; labour was requisitioned throughout\r\na district extending from Omi in the east to Aki in the west; the\r\nfloor of the \"great hall\"** was paved with tiles; there were twelve\r\ngates, three on each of the four sides, and the whole was in the\r\narchitectural style of the Tang dynasty. Yet for the roofs, boards\r\nalone were used.\r\n\r\n*Down to A.D. 645.1\r\n\r\n**It was here that the assassination of Soga no Iruka took place.\r\n\r\nPAINTING\r\n\r\nLittle is recorded about the progress of painting in this epoch. It\r\nhas been shown above that during Yuryaku's reign pictorial experts\r\ncrossed to Japan from Korea and from China. The Chronicles add that,\r\nin A.D. 604, when the Empress Suiko occupied the throne, two schools\r\nof painters were established, namely, the Kibumi and the Yamashiro.\r\nIt is elsewhere explained that the business of those artists was to\r\npaint Buddhist pictures, the special task of the Kibumi men being to\r\nilluminate scrolls of the Sutras. We read also that, in 603, on the\r\noccasion of the dedication of the temple of Hachioka, Prince Shotoku\r\npainted banners as offerings. These had probably the same designs as\r\nthose spoken of a century later (710) when, at a ceremony in the\r\ngreat hall of the palace, there were set up flags emblazoned with a\r\ncrow,* the sun, an azure dragon, a red bird, and the moon, all which\r\ndesigns were of Chinese origin. Shotoku Taishi himself is\r\ntraditionally reported to have been a skilled painter and sculptor,\r\nand several of his alleged masterpieces are preserved to this day,\r\nbut their authenticity is disputed.\r\n\r\n*The three-legged crow of the sun.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nIn the field of agriculture this epoch offers nothing more remarkable\r\nthan the construction of nine reservoirs for irrigation purposes and\r\nthe digging of a large canal in Yamashiro province. It is also\r\nthought worthy of historical notice that a Korean prince\r\nunsuccessfully attempted to domesticate bees on a Japanese mountain.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress seems to have been made in tradal matters.\r\nMarkets were opened at several places in the interior, and coastwise\r\ncommerce developed so much that, in A.D. 553, it was found expedient\r\nto appoint an official for the purpose of numbering and registering\r\nthe vessels thus employed. The Chinese settler, Wang Sin-i, who has\r\nalready been spoken of as the only person able to decipher a Korean\r\nmemorial, was given the office of fune no osa (chief of the shipping\r\nbureau) and granted the title of fune no fubito (registrar of\r\nvessels). Subsequently, during the reign of Jomei (629-641), an\r\nakinai-osa (chief of trade) was appointed in the person of Munemaro,\r\nwhose father, Kuhi, had brought scales and weights from China during\r\nthe reign of Sushun (558-592), and this system was formally adopted\r\nin the days of Jomei (629-641). There had not apparently been any\r\nofficially recognized weights and measures in remote antiquity. The\r\nwidth of the hand (ta or tsuka) and the spread of the arms (hiro)\r\nwere the only dimensions employed. By and by the Korean shaku (foot),\r\nwhich corresponds to 1.17 shaku of the present day, came into use. In\r\nKenso's time (485-487) there is mention of a measure of rice being\r\nsold for a piece of silver, and the Emperor Kimmei (540-571) is\r\nrecorded to have given 1000 koku of seed-barley to the King of\r\nKudara. But it is supposed that the writer of the Chronicles, in\r\nmaking these entries, projected the terminology of his own time into\r\nthe previous centuries. There were neither coins nor koku in those\r\neras.\r\n\r\nCOSTUME AND COIFFURE\r\n\r\nUp to the time (A.D. 603) of the institution of caps as marks of\r\nrank, men were in the habit of dividing their hair in the centre and\r\ntying it above the ears in a style called mizura. But such a fashion\r\ndid not accord with the wearing of caps which were gathered up on the\r\ncrown in the shape of a bag. Hence men of rank took to binding the\r\nhair in a queue on the top of the head. The old style was continued,\r\nhowever, by men having no rank and by youths. A child's hair was\r\nlooped on the temples in imitation of the flower of a gourd--hence\r\ncalled hisago-bana--and women wore their tresses hanging free. The\r\ninstitution of caps interfered also with the use of hairpins, which\r\nwere often made of gold and very elaborate. These now came to be\r\nthrust, not directly into the hair, but through the cord employed to\r\ntie the cap above. It is recorded that, in the year 611, when the\r\nEmpress Suiko and her Court went on a picnic, the colour of the\r\nministers' garments agreed with that of their official caps, and that\r\neach wore hair-ornaments which, in the case of the two highest\r\nfunctionaries, were made of gold; in the case of the next two, of\r\nleopards' tails; and in the case of lower ranks, of birds' tails.\r\n\r\nOn a more ceremonious occasion, namely, the reception of the Chinese\r\nenvoys from the Sui Court, the Chronicles state that Japanese princes\r\nand ministers \"all wore gold hair-ornaments,* and their garments were\r\nof brocade, purple, and embroidery, with thin silk stuffs of various\r\ncolours and patterns.\" Costume had become thus gorgeous after the\r\ninstitution of Buddhism and the establishment of intercourse direct\r\nwith the Sui, and, subsequently, the Tang dynasty. Even in the manner\r\nof folding the garments over the breast--not from right to left but\r\nfrom left to right--the imported fashion was followed. Wadded\r\ngarments are incidently mentioned in the year A.D. 643.\r\n\r\n*These were called usu. They were, in fact, hairpins, generally\r\nshaped like a flower.\r\n\r\nMUSIC AND AMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\nIt has already been recorded that, in the middle of the sixth\r\ncentury, musicians were sent from the Kudara Court to the Yamato, and\r\nsince these are said to have taken the place of others then\r\nsojourning in Japan, the fact is established that such a visit was\r\nnot then without precedent. Music, indeed, may be said to have\r\nbenefitted largely by the advent of Buddhism, for the services of the\r\nlatter required a special kind of music. The first foreign teacher of\r\nthe art was a Korean, Mimashi, who went to Japan in A.D. 612, after\r\nhaving studied both music and dancing for some years in China. A\r\ndwelling was assigned to him at Sakurai (in Yamato) and he trained\r\npupils. At the instance of Prince Shotoku and for the better\r\nperformance of Buddhist services, various privileges were granted to\r\nthe professors of the art. They were exempted from the discharge of\r\nofficial duties and their occupation became hereditary. Several\r\nancient Japanese books contain reference to music and dancing, and in\r\none work* illustrations are given of the wooden masks worn by dancers\r\nand the instruments used by musicians of the Wu (Chinese) school.\r\nThese masks were introduced by Mimashi and are still preserved in the\r\ntemple Horyu-ji.\r\n\r\n*The Horyu-ji Shizai-cho, composed in A.D. 747.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of pastimes, a favourite practice, first mentioned in\r\nthe reign of the Empress Suiko, was a species of picnic called\r\n\"medicine hunting\" (kusuri-kari). It took place on the fifth day of\r\nthe fifth month. The Empress, her ladies, and the high functionaries,\r\nall donned gala costumes and went to hunt stags, for the purpose of\r\nprocuring the young antlers, and to search for \"deer-fungus\"\r\n(shika-take), the horns and the vegetables being supposed to have\r\nmedical properties. All the amusements mentioned in previous sections\r\ncontinued to be followed in this era, and football is spoken of as\r\nhaving inaugurated the afterwards epoch-making friendship between\r\nPrince Naka and Kamatari. It was not played in the Occidental manner,\r\nhowever. The game consisted in kicking a ball from player to player\r\nwithout letting it fall. This was apparently a Chinese innovation.\r\nHere, also, mention may be made of thermal springs. Their sanitary\r\nproperties were recognized, and visits were paid to them by invalids.\r\nThe most noted were those of Dogo, in Iyo, and Arima, in Settsu. The\r\nEmperor Jomei spent several months at each of these, and Prince\r\nShotoku caused to be erected at Dogo a stone monument bearing an\r\ninscription to attest the curative virtues of the water.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThat Buddhism obtained a firm footing among the upper classes during\r\nthe first century after its introduction must be attributed in no\r\nsmall measure to the fact that the throne was twice occupied by\r\nEmpresses in that interval. The highly decorative aspects of the\r\ncreed appealing to the emotional side of woman's nature, these\r\nImperial ladies encouraged Buddhist propagandism with earnest\r\nmunificence. But the mass of the people remained, for the most part,\r\noutside the pale. They continued to believe in the Kami and to\r\nworship them. Thus, when a terribly destructive earthquake* occured\r\nin 599, it was to the Kami of earthquakes that prayers were offered\r\nat his seven shrines in the seven home provinces (Kinai), and not to\r\nthe Merciful Buddha, though the saving grace of the latter had then\r\nbeen preached for nearly a cycle. The first appeal to the foreign\r\ndeity in connexion with natural calamity was in the opening year\r\n(642) of the Empress Kogyoku's reign when, in the presence of a\r\ndevastating drought, sacrifices of horses and cattle to the Shinto\r\nKami, changes of the market-places,** and prayers to the river gods\r\nhaving all failed to bring relief, an imposing Buddhist service was\r\nheld in the south court of the Great Temple. \"The images of Buddha,\r\nof the bosatsu, and of the Four Heavenly Kings were magnificently\r\nadorned; a multitude of priests read the Mahayana Sutra, and the\r\no-omi, Soga no Emishi, held a censer, burned incense, and prayed.\"\r\nBut there was no success; and not until the Empress herself had made\r\na progress to the source of a river and worshipped towards the four\r\nquarters, did abundant rain fall.\r\n\r\n*Only three earthquakes are recorded up to the year A.D. 645, and the\r\nsecond alone (A.D. 599) is described as destructive.\r\n\r\n**This was a Chinese custom, as was also the sacrificial rite\r\nmentioned in the same context.\r\n\r\nSuch an incident cannot have contributed to popularize the Indian\r\ncreed. The people at large adhered to their traditional cult and were\r\neasily swayed by superstitions. The first half of the seventh century\r\nwas marked by abnormal occurrences well calculated to disturb men's\r\nminds. There were comets (twice); there was a meteor of large\r\ndimensions; there were eclipses of the sun and moon; there were\r\noccultations of Venus; there was snow in July and hail \"as large as\r\npeaches\" in May, and there was a famine (621) when old people ate\r\nroots of herbs and died by the wayside, when infants at the breast\r\nperished with their mothers, and when thieves and robbers defied\r\nauthority. It is not, perhaps, surprising in such circumstances, and\r\nwhen witches and wizards abounded, that people fell into strange\r\nmoods, and were persuaded to regard a caterpillar as the \"insect of\r\nthe everlasting world,\" to worship it, and to throw away their\r\nvaluables in the belief that riches and perpetual youth would be thus\r\nwon. A miyatsuko, by name Kawakatsu, had the courage to kill the\r\ndesigning preacher of this extravagance, and the moral epidemic was\r\nthus stayed.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ONE OF THE STATUES OF \"SHITENNO\" IN THE KAIDAN-IN, TODAIJI\r\n(Tembyo Sculpture, Eighth Century)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: UTENSILS USED IN THE TEA CEREMONY (CHA-NO-YU)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE DAIKA REFORMS\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTY-SIXTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KOTOKU (A.D. 645-654)\r\n\r\nAFTER the fall of the Soga and the abdication of the Empress Kogyoku,\r\nher son, Prince Naka, would have been the natural successor, and such\r\nwas her own expressed wish. But the prince's procedure was largely\r\nregulated by Kamatari, who, alike in the prelude and in the sequel of\r\nthis crisis, proved himself one of the greatest statesmen Japan ever\r\nproduced. He saw that the Soga influence, though broken, was not\r\nwholly shattered, and he understood that the great administrative\r\nreform which he contemplated might be imperilled were the throne\r\nimmediately occupied by a prince on whose hands the blood of the Soga\r\nchief was still warm. Therefore he advised Prince Naka to stand aside\r\nin favour of his maternal uncle, Prince Karu, who could be trusted to\r\nco-operate loyally in the work of reform and whose connexion with the\r\nSoga overthrow had been less conspicuous. But to reach Prince Karu it\r\nwas necessary to pass over the head of another prince, Furubito,\r\nNaka's half-brother, who had the full sympathy of the remnant of the\r\nSoga clan, his mother having been a daughter of the great Umako. The\r\nthrone was therefore offered to him. But since the offer followed,\r\ninstead of preceding the Empress' approval of Prince Karu, Furubito\r\nrecognized the farce, and knowing that, though he might rule in\r\ndefiance of the Kamatari faction, he could not hope to rule with its\r\nconsent, he threw away his sword and declared his intention of\r\nentering religion.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Buddhist monastery at Yoshino, where he received the\r\ntonsure, became a rallying point for the Soga partisans, and a war\r\nfor the succession seemed imminent. Naka, however, now Prince\r\nImperial, was not a man to dally with such obstacles. He promptly\r\nsent to Yoshino a force of soldiers who killed Furubito with his\r\nchildren and permitted his consorts to strangle themselves. Prince\r\nNaka's name must go down to all generations as that of a great\r\nreformer, but it is also associated with a terrible injustice. Too\r\nreadily crediting a slanderous charge brought against his\r\nfather-in-law, Kurayamada, who had stood at his right hand in the\r\ngreat coup d'etat of 645, he despatched a force to seize the alleged\r\ntraitor. Kurayamada fled to a temple, and there, declaring that he\r\nwould \"leave the world, still cherishing fidelity in his bosom,\" he\r\ncommitted suicide, his wife and seven children sharing his fate.\r\nSubsequent examination of his effects established his innocence, and\r\nhis daughter, consort of Prince Naka, died of grief.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIKA, OR \"GREAT CHANGE\"\r\n\r\nNot for these things, however, but for sweeping reforms in the\r\nadministration of the empire is the reign of Kotoku memorable. Prince\r\nNaka and Kamatari, during the long period of their intimate\r\nintercourse prior to the deed of blood in the great hall of audience,\r\nhad fully matured their estimates of the Sui and Tang civilization as\r\nrevealed in documents and information carried to Japan by priests,\r\nliterati, and students, who, since the establishment of Buddhism, had\r\npaid many visits to China. They appreciated that the system\r\nprevailing in their own country from time immemorial had developed\r\nabuses which were sapping the strength of the nation, and in sweeping\r\nthe Soga from the path to the throne, their ambition had been to gain\r\nan eminence from which the new civilization might be authoritatively\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, their main objects were to abolish the system of\r\nhereditary office-holders; to differentiate aristocratic titles from\r\nofficial ranks; to bring the whole mass of the people into direct\r\nsubjection to the Throne, and to establish the Imperial right of\r\nownership in all the land throughout the empire. What these changes\r\nsignified and with what tact and wisdom the reformers proceeded, will\r\nbe clearly understood as the story unfolds itself. Spectacular effect\r\nwas enlisted as the first ally. A coronation ceremony of\r\nunprecedented magnificence took place. High officials, girt with\r\ngolden quivers, stood on either side of the dais forming the throne,\r\nand all the great functionaries--omi, muraji, and miyatsuko--together\r\nwith representatives of the 180 hereditary corporations (be) filed\r\npast, making obeisance. The title of \"Empress Dowager\" was conferred\r\nfor the first time on Kogyoku, who had abdicated; Prince Naka was\r\nmade Prince Imperial; the head of the great uji of Abe was nominated\r\nminister of the Left (sa-daijiri); Kurayamada, of the Soga-uji, who\r\nhad shared the dangers of the conspiracy against Emishi and Iruka,\r\nbecame minister of the Right (u-daijiri), and Kamatari himself\r\nreceived the post of minister of the Interior (nai-daijin), being\r\ninvested with the right to be consulted on all matters whether of\r\nstatecraft or of official personnel.\r\n\r\nThese designations, \"minister of the Left\"*, \"minister of the Right,\"\r\nand \"minister of the Interior,\" were new in Japan.** Hitherto, there\r\nhad been o-omi and o-muraji, who stood between the Throne and the two\r\ngreat classes of uji, the o-omi and the o-muraji receiving\r\ninstructions direct from the sovereign, and the two classes of uji\r\nacknowledging no control except that of the o-omi and the o-muraji.\r\nBut whereas the personal status of Kurayamada was only omi (not\r\no-omi), and the personal status of Kamatari, only muraji (not\r\no-muraji), neither was required, in his new capacity, to take\r\ninstructions from any save the Emperor, nor did any one of the three\r\nhigh dignitaries nominally represent this or that congeries of uji. A\r\nsimultaneous innovation was the appointment of a Buddhist priest,\r\nBin, and a literatus, Kuromaro, to be \"national doctors.\" These men\r\nhad spent some years at the Tang Court and were well versed in\r\nChinese systems.\r\n\r\n*The left takes precedence of the right in Japan.\r\n\r\n**The offices were borrowed from the Tang system of China a remark\r\nwhich applies to nearly all the innovations of the epoch.\r\n\r\nThe next step taken was to assemble the ministers under a patriarchal\r\ntree, and, in the presence of the Emperor, the Empress Dowager, and\r\nthe Prince Imperial, to pronounce, in the names of the Kami of heaven\r\nand the Kami of earth--the Tenshin and the Chigi--a solemn\r\nimprecation on rulers who attempted double-hearted methods of\r\ngovernment, and on vassals guilty of treachery in the service of\r\ntheir sovereign. This amounted to a formal denunciation of the Soga\r\nas well as a pledge on the part of the new Emperor. The Chinese\r\nmethod of reckoning time by year-periods was then adopted, and the\r\nyear A.D. 645 became the first of the Daika era. But before\r\nproceeding to really radical innovations, two further precautions\r\nwere taken. In order to display reverence for the foundations of the\r\nState, the sovereign publicly declared that \"the empire should be\r\nruled by following the footsteps of the Emperors of antiquity,\" and\r\nin order to win the sympathy of the lower orders, his Majesty\r\ndirected that inquiry should be made as to the best method of\r\nalleviating the hardships of forced labour. Further, a solemn\r\nceremony of Shinto worship was held by way of preface.\r\n\r\nThen the reformers commenced their work in earnest. Governors\r\n(kokushi) were appointed to all the eastern provinces. These\r\nofficials were not a wholly novel institution. It has been shown that\r\nthey existed previously to the Daika era, but in a fitful and\r\nuncertain way, whereas, under the system now adopted, they became an\r\nintegral part of the administrative machinery. That meant that the\r\ngovernment of the provinces, instead of being administered by\r\nhereditary officials, altogether irrespective of their competence,\r\nwas entrusted for a fixed term to men chosen on account of special\r\naptitude. The eastern provinces were selected for inaugurating this\r\nexperiment, because their distance from the capital rendered the\r\nchange less conspicuous. Moreover, the appointments were given, as\r\nfar as possible, to the former miyatsuko or mikotomochi. An ordinance\r\nwas now issued for placing a petition-box in the Court and hanging a\r\nbell near it. The box was intended to serve as a receptacle for\r\ncomplaints and representations. Anyone had a right to present such\r\ndocuments. They were to be collected and conveyed to the Emperor\r\nevery morning, and if a reply was tardy, the bell was to be struck.\r\n\r\nSide by side with these measures for bettering the people's lot,\r\nprecautions against any danger of disturbance were adopted by taking\r\nall weapons of war out of the hands of private individuals and\r\nstoring them in arsenals specially constructed on waste lands. Then\r\nfollowed a measure which seems to have been greatly needed. It has\r\nbeen already explained that a not inconsiderable element of the\r\npopulation was composed of slaves, and that these consisted of two\r\nmain classes, namely, aborigines or Koreans taken prisoners in war,\r\nand members of an uji whose Kami had been implicated in crime. As\r\ntime passed, there resulted from intercourse between these slaves and\r\ntheir owners a number of persons whose status was confused, parents\r\nasserting the manumission of their children and masters insisting on\r\nthe permanence of the bond. To correct these complications the whole\r\nnation was now divided into freemen (ryomin) and bondmen (senmin),\r\nand a law was enacted that, since among slaves no marriage tie was\r\nofficially recognized, a child of mixed parentage must always be\r\nregarded as a bondman. On that basis a census was ordered to be\r\ntaken, and in it were included not only the people of all classes,\r\nbut also the area of cultivated and throughout the empire.\r\n\r\nAt the same time stringent regulations were enacted for the control\r\nand guidance of the provincial governors. They were to take counsel\r\nwith the people in dividing the profits of agriculture. They were not\r\nto act as judges in criminal cases or to accept bribes from suitors\r\nin civil ones; their staff, when visiting the capital, was strictly\r\nlimited, and the use of public-service horses* as well as the\r\nconsumption of State provisions was vetoed unless they were\r\ntravelling on public business. Finally, they were enjoined to\r\ninvestigate carefully all claims to titles and all alleged rights of\r\nland tenure. The next step was the most drastic and far-reaching of\r\nall. Hereditary corporations were entirely abolished, alike those\r\nestablished to commemorate the name of a sovereign or a prince and\r\nthose employed by the nobles to cultivate their estates. The estates\r\nthemselves were escheated. Thus, at one stroke, the lands and titles\r\nof the hereditary aristocracy were annulled, just as was destined to\r\nbe the case in the Meiji era, twelve centuries later.\r\n\r\n*Everyone having a right to use public-service horses was required to\r\ncarry a token of his right in the shape of a small bronze bell, or\r\ngroup of bells, indicating by their shape and number how many horses\r\nthe bearer was entitled to.\r\n\r\nThis reform involved a radical change in the system and method of\r\ntaxation, but the consideration of that phase of the question is\r\ndeferred for a moment in order to explain the nature and the amount\r\nof the new fiscal burdens. Two kinds of taxes were thenceforth\r\nimposed, namely, ordinary taxes and commuted taxes. The ordinary\r\nconsisted of twenty sheaves of rice per cho* (equivalent to about\r\neight sheaves per acre), and the commuted tax--in lieu of forced\r\nlabour--was fixed at a piece of silk fabric forty feet in length by\r\ntwo and a half feet in breadth per cho, being approximately a length\r\nof sixteen feet per acre. The dimensions of the fabric were doubled\r\nin the case of coarse silk, and quadrupled in the case of cloth woven\r\nfrom hemp or from the fibre of the inner bark of the paper-mulberry.\r\nA commuted tax was levied on houses also, namely, a twelve-foot\r\nlength of the above cloth per house. No currency existed in that age.\r\nAll payments were made in kind. There is, therefore, no method of\r\ncalculating accurately the monetary equivalent of a sheaf of rice.\r\nBut in the case of fabrics we have some guide. Thus, in addition to\r\nthe above imposts, every two townships--a township was a group of\r\nfifty houses--had to contribute one horse of medium quality (or one\r\nof superior quality per two hundred houses) for public service; and\r\nsince a horse was regarded as the equivalent of a total of twelve\r\nfeet of cloth per house, it would follow, estimating a horse of\r\nmedium quality at £5, ($25.), that the commuted tax in the case of\r\nland was above 5s.4d., ($1.30) per acre. Finally, each homestead was\r\nrequired to provide one labourer as well as rations for his support;\r\nand every two homesteads had to furnish one palace waiting-woman\r\n(uneme), who must be good-looking, the daughter or sister of a\r\ndistrict official of high rank, and must have one male and two female\r\nservants to attend on her--these also being supported by the two\r\nhomesteads. In every homestead there was an alderman who kept the\r\nregister, directed agricultural operations, enforced taxes, and took\r\nmeasures to prevent crime as well as to judge it.\r\n\r\n*The cho was two and a half acres approximately.\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that a regular system of national taxation was\r\nintroduced and that the land throughout the whole empire was\r\nconsidered to be the property of the Crown. As for the nobles who\r\nwere deprived of their estates, sustenance gifts were given to them,\r\nbut there is no record of the bases upon which these gifts were\r\nassessed. With regard to the people's share in the land, the plan\r\npursued was that for every male or female over five years of age two\r\ntan (about half an acre) should be given to the former and one-third\r\nless to the latter, these grants being made for a period of six\r\nyears, at the end of which time a general restoration was to be\r\neffected. A very striking evidence of the people's condition is that\r\nevery adult male had to contribute a sword, armour, a bow and arrows,\r\nand a drum. This impost may well have outweighed all the others.\r\n\r\nSEPULCHRES\r\n\r\nAnother important reform regulated the dimensions of burial mounds.\r\nThe construction of these on the grand scale adopted for many\r\nsovereigns, princes, and nobles had long harrassed the people, who\r\nwere compelled to give their toil gratis for such a purpose. What\r\nsuch exactions had entailed may be gathered from Kotoku's edict,\r\nwhich said, \"Of late the poverty of our people is absolutely due to\r\nthe construction of tombs.\" Nevertheless, he did not undertake to\r\nlimit the size of Imperial tombs. The rescript dealt only with those\r\nfrom princes downwards. Of these, the greatest tumulus permitted was\r\na square mound with a side of forty-five feet at the base and a\r\nheight of twenty-five feet, measured along the slope, a further\r\nrestriction being that the work must not occupy more than one\r\nthousand men for seven days. The maximum dimensions were similarly\r\nprescribed in every case, down to a minor official, whose grave must\r\nnot give employment to more than fifty men for one day. When ordinary\r\npeople died, it was directed that they should be buried in the ground\r\nwithout a day's delay, and, except in the case of an Emperor or an\r\nEmpress, the custom of temporary interment was strictly vetoed.\r\nCemeteries were ordered to be constructed for the first time, and\r\nperemptory injunctions were issued against self-destruction to\r\naccompany the dead; against strangling men or women by way of\r\nsacrifice; against killing the deceased's horse, and against cutting\r\nthe hair or stabbing the thighs by way of showing grief. It must be\r\nassumed that all these customs existed.\r\n\r\nABUSES\r\n\r\nOther evil practices are incidentally referred to in the context of\r\nthe Daika reforms. Thus it appears that slaves occasionally left\r\ntheir lawful owners owing to the latter's poverty and entered the\r\nservice of rich men, who thereafter refused to give them up; that\r\nwhen a divorced wife or concubine married into another family, her\r\nformer husband, after the lapse of years, often preferred claims\r\nagainst her new husband's property; that men, relying on their power,\r\ndemanded people's daughters in marriage, and in the event of the girl\r\nentering another house, levied heavy toll on both families; that when\r\na widow, of ten or twenty years' standing, married again, or when a\r\ngirl entered into wedlock, the people of the vicinity insisted on the\r\nnewly wedded couple performing the Shinto rite of harai (purgation),\r\nwhich was perverted into a device for compelling offerings of goods\r\nand wine; that the compulsory performance of this ceremony had become\r\nso onerous as to make poor men shrink from giving burial to even\r\ntheir own brothers who had died at a distance from home, or hesitate\r\nto extend aid to them in mortal peril, and that when a forced\r\nlabourer cooked his food by the roadside or borrowed a pot to boil\r\nhis rice, he was often obliged to perform expensive purgation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nAt the head of all officials were the sa-daijin (minister of the\r\nLeft), the u-daijin (minister of the Right) and the nai-daijin\r\n(minister of the Interior), and after them came the heads of\r\ndepartments, of which eight were established, after the model\r\nof the Tang Court in China. They were the Central Department\r\n(Nakatsukasa-sho); the Department of Ceremonies (Shikibu-sho); the\r\nDepartment of Civil Government (Jibu-sho); the Department of Civil\r\nAffairs (Mimbu-sho); the Department of War (Hyobu-sho); the\r\nDepartment of Justice (Gyobu-sho); the Treasury (Okura-sho), and the\r\nHousehold Department (Kunai-sho). These departments comprised a\r\nnumber of bureaux. All officials of high rank had to assemble at the\r\nsouth gate of the palace in time to enter at sunrise, and they\r\nremained there until some time between 11 A.M. and 1 P.M.\r\n\r\nIn a province the senior official was the governor, and under him\r\nwere heads of districts, aldermen of homesteads (fifty houses),\r\nelders of five households--all the houses being divided into groups\r\nof five for purposes of protection--and market commissioners who\r\nsuperintended the currency (in kind), commerce, the genuineness of\r\nwares, the justness of weights and measures, the prices of\r\ncommodities, and the observance of prohibitions. Since to all\r\nofficial posts men of merit were appointed without regard to lineage,\r\nthe cap-ranks inaugurated by Prince Shotoku were abolished, inasmuch\r\nas they designated personal status by inherited right only, and they\r\nwere replaced by new cap-grades, nineteen in all, which were\r\ndistinguished partly by their borders, partly by their colours, and\r\npartly by their materials and embroidery. Hair-ornaments were also a\r\nmark of rank. They were cicada-shaped, of gold and silver for the\r\nhighest grades, of silver for the medium grades, and of copper for\r\nthe low grades. The caps indicated official status without any\r\nreference to hereditary titles.\r\n\r\nRATIONALE OF THE NEW SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe radical changes outlined above were all effected in the short\r\nspace of eight years. If it be asked what motive inspired the\r\nreformers, the obvious answer is that experience, culminating in the\r\nusurpations of the Soga, had fully displayed the abuses incidental to\r\nthe old system. Nothing more memorable than this flood of reforms has\r\nleft its mark upon Japan's ancient history. During the first thirteen\r\ncenturies of the empire's existence--if we accept the traditional\r\nchronology--the family was the basis of the State's organization.\r\nEach unit of the population either was a member of an uji or belonged\r\nto the tomobe of an uji, and each uji was governed by its own omi or\r\nmuraji, while all the uji of the Kwobetsu class were under the o-omi\r\nand all those of the Shimbetsu class, under the o-muraji. Finally, it\r\nwas through the o-omi and the o-muraji alone that the Emperor\r\ncommunicated his will. In other words, the Japanese at large were not\r\nrecognized as public people, the only section that bore that\r\ncharacter being the units of the hereditary corporations instituted\r\nin memory of some Imperial personage and the folk that cultivated the\r\nmiyake (State domains).\r\n\r\nAll these facts, though already familiar to the reader, find a\r\nfitting place in the context of the great political development of\r\nthe Daika era. For the main features of that development were that\r\nthe entire nation became the public people of the realm and the whole\r\nof the land became the property of the Crown, the hereditary nobles\r\nbeing relegated to the rank of State pensioners. This metamorphosis\r\nentailed taking an accurate census of the population; making a survey\r\nof the land; fixing the boundaries of provinces, districts, and\r\nvillages; appointing officials to administer the affairs of these\r\nlocal divisions, and organizing the central government with boards\r\nand bureaux. The system of taxation also had to be changed, and the\r\nland had to be apportioned to the people. In former days, the only\r\ncharges levied by the State on the produce of the land were those\r\nconnected with religious observances and military operations, and\r\neven in imposing these the intervention of the heads of uji had to be\r\nemployed. But by the Daika reforms the interest of the hereditary\r\nnobility in the taxes Avas limited to realizing their sustenance\r\nallowances; while as for the land, it was removed entirely beyond\r\ntheir control and partitioned among the people, in the proportion\r\nalready noted, on leases terminable at the end of six years.\r\n\r\nOf course, whatever political exigency may have dictated this\r\nshort-tenure system, it was economically unsound and could not remain\r\nlong in practice. The measures adopted to soften the aspect of these\r\nwholesale changes in the eyes of the hereditary nobility whom they so\r\ngreatly affected, have been partly noted above. It may here be added,\r\nhowever, that not only was the office of district governor--who\r\nranked next to the provincial governor (kokushi)--filled as far as\r\npossible by former kuni no miyatsuko, but also these latter were\r\nentrusted with the duty of observing and reporting upon the conduct\r\nof the new officials as to assiduity and integrity, to which duty\r\nthere were also nominated special officials called choshu-shi. By the\r\naid of these and other tactful devices, the operation of the new\r\nsystem was guaranteed against disturbance. Nothing was deemed too\r\ntrivial to assist in promoting that end. Even such a petty incident\r\nas the appearance of a white pheasant was magnified into a special\r\nindication of heaven's approval, and a grand Court ceremony having\r\nbeen held in honour of the bird, the Emperor proclaimed a general\r\namnesty and ordered that the name of the period should be changed to\r\nHaku-chi (White Pheasant). Something of this may be set down frankly\r\nto the superstitious spirit of the time. But much is evidently\r\nattributable to the statecraft of the Emperor's advisers, who sought\r\nto persuade the nation that this breaking away from all its venerable\r\nold traditions had supernatural approval.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, one defect in the theory of the new system. From\r\ntime immemorial the polity of the empire had been based on the family\r\nrelation. The sovereign reigned in virtue of his lineage, and the\r\nhereditary nobles owed their high positions and administrative\r\ncompetence equally to descent. To discredit the title of the nobles\r\nwas to disturb the foundation of the Throne itself, and to affirm\r\nthat want of virtue constituted a valid reason for depriving the\r\nscions of the gods of their inherited functions, was to declare\r\nconstructively that the descendant of Amaterasu also held his title\r\nby right of personal worthiness. That was the Chinese theory. Their\r\nhistory shows plainly that they recognized the right of men like Tang\r\nor Wu to overturn tyrants like Chieh of the Hsia dynasty, and Chou of\r\nthe Yen dynasty. The two Japanese Emperors, Kotoku and Tenchi\r\n(668-671), seem to have partially endorsed a cognate principle. But\r\nnothing could be at greater variance with the cardinal tenet of the\r\nJapanese polity, which holds that \"the King can do no wrong\" and that\r\nthe Imperial line must remain unbroken to all eternity.\r\n\r\nENVOYS TO CHINA\r\n\r\nThe importance attached to intercourse with China during the reign of\r\nKotoku was illustrated by the dimensions of the embassies sent to the\r\nTang Court and by the quality of the envoys. Two embassies were sent\r\nin 653, one consisting of 121 persons and the other of 120.* The\r\nformer included seventeen student-priests, and among them was the\r\neldest son of Kamatari himself. Another embassy was despatched in\r\n654, and the records show incidently that the sea route was taken,\r\nfor after a voyage lasting some months and therefore presumably of a\r\ncoasting character, the envoys landed at Laichou in Shantung. They\r\nfinally reached Changan, the Tang capital, and were most hospitably\r\nreceived by the Emperor Kao-sung. The hardships of the journey are\r\nattested by the fact that three of the student-priests died at sea.\r\nOne remained in China for thirty-six years, and Joye, Kamatari's son,\r\ndid not return to Japan for twelve years.\r\n\r\n*The ship carrying the embassy was wrecked off the south coast of\r\nJapan, and out of 120 persons only five escaped.\r\n\r\nIn short, when these students left their country in search of\r\nliterary, religious, and political lore, they had no assurance of\r\never thereafter finding an opportunity to see their homes again. The\r\noverland journey was almost impossible without guides and guards, and\r\ncommunication by sea seems to have been fitful and uncertain. The\r\nlast of the above three embassies was led by no less a person than\r\nthe renowned scholar, Kuromaro, who had been associated with the\r\npriest, Bin, in modelling the new administrative system of Japan.\r\nKuromaro never returned from China; he died there. A few months\r\nbefore the despatch of Kuromaro as envoy, his illustrious coadjutor,\r\nBin, expired in the temple of Azumi. The Emperor repaired in person\r\nto the sick priest's chamber, and said, \"If you die to-day, I will\r\nfollow you to-morrow.\" So great was the reverence showed towards\r\nlearning and piety in that era. Thus, hazardous and wearisome as was\r\nthe voyage to China over stormy waters in a rude sailing boat, its\r\nsuccessful accomplishment established a title to official preferment\r\nand high honour. It will be seen by and by that similar treatment was\r\nextended in the nineteenth century to men who visited Europe and\r\nAmerica in the pursuit of knowledge.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTY-SEVENTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS SAIMEI (A.D. 655-661)\r\n\r\nOn the demise of Kotoku, in 654, his natural successor would have\r\nbeen Prince Naka, who, ten years previously, had chosen to reform the\r\nempire rather than to rule it. But the prince deemed that the course\r\nof progress still claimed his undivided attention, and therefore the\r\nEmpress Kogyoku was again raised to the throne under the name of*\r\nSaimei--the first instance of a second accession in Japanese history.\r\nShe reigned nearly seven years, and the era is remarkable chiefly for\r\nexpeditions against the Yemishi and for complications with Korea. To\r\nthe former chapter of history sufficient reference had already been\r\nmade, but the latter claims a moment's attention.\r\n\r\n*It is scarcely necessary to remind the reader that all\r\nthe names given in these pages to Japanese sovereigns are\r\nposthumous. Thus Saimei, during her lifetime, was called\r\nAme-toyo-takara-ikashi-hi-tarashi-hime.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH KOREA\r\n\r\nIt has been shown how, in A.D. 562, the Japanese settlement in Mimana\r\nwas exterminated; how the Emperor Kimmei's dying behest to his\r\nsuccessor was that this disgrace must be removed; how subsequent\r\nattempts to carry out his testament ended in failure, owing largely\r\nto Japan's weak habit of trusting the promises of Shiragi, and how,\r\nin 618, the Sui Emperor, Yang, at the head of a great army, failed to\r\nmake any impression on Korea.\r\n\r\nThereafter, intercourse between Japan and the peninsula was of a\r\nfitful character unmarked by any noteworthy event until, in the\r\nsecond year (651) of the \"White Pheasant\" era, the Yamato Court\r\nessayed to assert itself in a futile fashion by refusing to give\r\naudience to Shiragi envoys because they wore costumes after the Tang\r\nfashion without offering any excuse for such a caprice. Kotoku was\r\nthen upon the Japanese throne, and Japan herself was busily occupied\r\nimporting and assimilating Tang institutions. That she should have\r\ntaken umbrage at similar imitation on Shiragi's part seems\r\ncapricious. Shiragi sent no more envoys, and presently (655), finding\r\nherself seriously menaced by a coalition between Koma and Kudara, she\r\napplied to the Tang Court for assistance. The application produced no\r\npractical response, but Shiragi, who for some time had been able to\r\ndefy the other two principalities, now saw and seized an opportunity\r\noffered by the debauchery and misrule of the King of Kudara. She\r\ncollected an army to attack her neighbour and once more supplicated\r\nTang's aid. This was in the year 660. The second appeal produced a\r\npowerful response. Kao-sung, then the Tang Emperor, despatched a\r\ngeneral, Su Ting-fang, at the head of an army of two hundred thousand\r\nmen. There was now no long and tedious overland march round the\r\nlittoral of the Gulf of Pechili and across Liaotung. Su embarked his\r\nforces at Chengshan, on the east of the Shantung promontory, and\r\ncrossed direct to Mishi-no-tsu--the modern Chemulpo--thus attacking\r\nKudara from the west while Shiragi moved against it from the east.\r\nKudara was crushed. It lost ten thousand men, and all its prominent\r\npersonages, from the debauched King downwards, were sent as prisoners\r\nto Tang. But one great captain, Pok-sin, saved the situation.\r\nCollecting the fugitive troops of Kudara he fell suddenly on Shiragi\r\nand drove her back, thereafter appealing for Japanese aid.\r\n\r\nAt the Yamato Court Shiragi was now regarded as a traditional enemy.\r\nIt had played fast and loose again and again about Mimana, and in the\r\nyear 657 it had refused safe conduct for a Japanese embassy to the\r\nTang Court. The Empress Saimei decided that Kudara must be succoured.\r\nLiving in Japan at that time was Phung-chang,* a younger brother of\r\nthe deposed King of Kudara. It was resolved that he should be sent to\r\nthe peninsula accompanied by a sufficient force to place him on the\r\nthrone. But Saimei died before the necessary preparations were\r\ncompleted, and the task of carrying out a design which had already\r\nreceived his endorsement devolved upon Prince Naka, the great\r\nreformer. A fleet of 170 ships carrying an army of thirty-seven\r\nthousand men escorted Phung-chang from Tsukushi, and the kingdom of\r\nKudara was restored. But the conclusive battle had still to be\r\nfought. It took place in September, 662, at Paik-chhon-ku (Ung-jin),\r\nbetween the Chinese under Liu Jen-kuei, a Tang general, and the\r\nJapanese under Atsumi no Hirafu. The forces were about equal on each\r\nside, and it was the first signal trial of strength between Chinese\r\nand Japanese. No particulars have been handed down by history.\r\nNothing is known except that the Japanese squadron drove straight\r\nahead, and that the Chinese attacked from both flanks. The result was\r\na crushing defeat for the Japanese. They were shattered beyond the\r\npower of rallying, and only a remnant found its way back to Tsukushi.\r\nKudara and Koma fell, and Japan lost her last footing in a region\r\nwhere her prestige had stood so high for centuries.\r\n\r\n*He was a hostage. The constant residence of Korean hostages in Japan\r\nspeaks eloquently of the relations existing between the two\r\ncountries. There were no Japanese hostages in Korea.\r\n\r\nShiragi continued during more than a hundred years to maintain a\r\nsemblance of deferential intercourse, but her conduct became\r\nultimately so unruly that, in the reign of Nimmyo (834-850), her\r\npeople were prohibited from visiting Japan. From Kudara, however,\r\nafter its overthrow by China, there migrated almost continuously for\r\nsome time a number of inhabitants who became naturalized in Japan.\r\nThey were distributed chiefly in the provinces of Omi and Musashi,\r\nSon-Kwang, a brother of the former King of Kudara, being required to\r\nlive in Naniwa (Osaka) for the purpose of controlling them. Koma,\r\nalso, when it fell into Chinese hands, sent many settlers to Japan,\r\nand during the reign of the Empress Gemmyo (708-715), they were\r\ntransferred from the six provinces of Suruga, Kai, Sagami, Kazusa,\r\nShimosa, and Hitachi to Musashi, where the district inhabited by them\r\nwas thenceforth called Koma-gori. Thus, Japan extended her\r\nhospitality to the men whose independence she had not been able to\r\nassert. Her relations with her peninsular neighbour ended humanely\r\nthough not gloriously. They had cost her heavily in life and\r\ntreasure, but she had been repaid fully with the civilization which\r\nKorea helped her to import.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTY-EIGHTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR TENCHI (A.D. 668-671)\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that although the thirty-seventh sovereign, the\r\nEmpress Saimei, died in the year 661, the reign of her successor,\r\nTenchi, did not commence historically until 668. There thus appears\r\nto have been an interregnum of seven years. The explanation is that\r\nthe Crown Prince, Naka, while taking the sceptre, did not actually\r\nwield it. He entrusted the administrative functions to his younger\r\nbrother, Oama, and continued to devote himself to the great work of\r\nreform. He had stood aside in favour of Kotoku sixteen years\r\npreviously and in favour of the Empress Saimei six years previously,\r\nand now, for seven years longer, he refrained from identifying\r\nhimself with the Throne until the fate of his innovations was known.\r\nHaving assumed the task of eradicating abuses which, for a thousand\r\nyears, had been growing unchecked, he shrank from associating the\r\nCrown directly with risks of failure. But in the year 668, judging\r\nthat his reforms had been sufficiently assimilated to warrant\r\nconfidence, he formally ascended the throne and is known in history\r\nas Tenchi (Heavenly Intelligence).\r\n\r\nOnly four years of life remained to him, and almost immediately after\r\nhis accession he lost his great coadjutor, Kamatari. Of the four men\r\nwho had worked out the \"Daika restoration,\" Kuromaro, the student,\r\ndied in China a year (654) after the demise of the illustrious\r\npriest, Bin; Kamatari barely survived until success came in sight,\r\nand Prince Naka (Tenchi) was taken two years later (671). It is\r\nrelated that in the days when the prince and Kamatari planned the\r\noutlines of their great scheme, they were accustomed to meet for\r\npurposes of conference in a remote valley on the east of the capital,\r\nwhere an aged wistaria happened to be in bloom at the most critical\r\nof their consultations. Kamatari therefore desired to change his uji\r\nname from Nakatomi to Fujiwara (wistaria), and the prince, on\r\nascending the throne, gave effect to this request. There thus came\r\ninto existence a family, the most famous in Japanese history. The\r\nsecluded valley where the momentous meetings took place received the\r\nname of Tamu* no Mine, and a shrine stands there now in memory of\r\nKamatari. The Emperor would fain have attended Kamatari's obsequies\r\nin person, but his ministers dissuaded him on the ground that such a\r\ncourse would be unprecedented. His Majesty confined himself therefore\r\nto conferring on the deceased statesman posthumous official rank, the\r\nfirst instance of a practice destined to became habitual in Japan.\r\n\r\n*\"Tamu\" signifies to converse about military affairs.\r\n\r\nTHE OMI STATUES AND THE CENSUS REGISTER\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Tenchi no rescript embodying signal\r\nadministrative changes was issued, though the reforms previously\r\ninaugurated seem to have made steady progress. But by a legislative\r\noffice specially organized for the purpose there was enacted a body\r\nof twenty-two laws called the Omi Ritsu-ryo (the Omi Statutes), Omi,\r\non the shore of Lake Biwa, being then the seat of the Imperial Court.\r\nShotoku Taishi's Jushichi Kempo, though often spoken of as a\r\nlegislative ordinance, was really an ethical code, but the Omi\r\nRitsu-ryo had the character of genuine laws, the first of their kind\r\nin Japan. Unfortunately this valuable document did not survive. Our\r\nknowledge of it is confined to a statement in the Memoirs of Kamatari\r\nthat it was compiled in the year 667. Two years later--that is to\r\nsay, in the year after Tenchi's actual accession--the census\r\nregister, which had formed an important feature of the Daika reforms,\r\nbecame an accomplished fact. Thenceforth there was no further\r\noccasion to appeal to the barbarous ordeal of boiling water\r\n(kuga-dachi) when questions of lineage had to be determined.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTY-NINTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KOBUN (A.D. 672-672)\r\n\r\nAmong four \"palace ladies\" (uneme) upon whom the Emperor Tenchi\r\nlooked with favour, one, Yaka of Iga province, bore him a son known\r\nin his boyhood days as Prince Iga but afterwards called Prince Otomo.\r\nFor this lad his father conceived a strong affection, and would\r\ndoubtless have named him heir apparent had he not been deterred by\r\nthe consideration that during his own abstention from actually\r\noccupying the throne, administrative duties would have to be\r\nentrusted mainly to the hands of a Prince Imperial, and Otomo, being\r\nonly thirteen years of age, could not undertake such a task. Thus, on\r\nTenchi's younger brother, Oama, the dignity of Crown Prince was\r\nconferred, and he became the Emperor's locum tenens, in which\r\nposition he won universal applause by sagacity and energy. But during\r\nthese seven years of nominal interregnum, the fame of Prince Otomo\r\nalso grew upon men's lips. An ancient book speaks of him as \"wise and\r\nintelligent; an able administrator alike of civil and of military\r\naffairs; commanding respect and esteem; sage of speech, and rich in\r\nlearning.\" When the Emperor actually ascended the throne, Otomo had\r\nreached his twentieth year, and four years later (671) the sovereign\r\nappointed him prime minister (dajo daijin), an office then created\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\nThenceforth the question of Tenchi's successor began to be\r\ndisquieting. The technical right was on Oama's side, but the paternal\r\nsympathy was with Otomo. Tradition has handed down a tale about a\r\ncertain Princess Nukata, who, having bestowed her affections\r\noriginally on Prince Oama, was afterwards constrained to yield to the\r\naddresses of the Emperor Tenchi, and thus the two brothers became\r\nenemies. But that story does not accord with facts. It is also\r\nrelated that during a banquet at the palace on the occasion of\r\nTenchi's accession, Prince Oama thrust a spear through the floor from\r\nbelow, and the Emperor would have punished the outrage with death had\r\nnot Kamatari interceded for the prince. These narratives are cited to\r\nprove that the Emperor Tenchi's purpose was to leave the throne to\r\nOtomo, not Oama. There is, however, no valid reason to infer any such\r\nintention. What actually occurred was that when, within a few months\r\nof Otomo's appointment as dajo daijin, the sovereign found himself\r\nmortally sick, he summoned Oama and named him to succeed But Oama,\r\nhaving been warned of a powerful conspiracy to place Otomo on the\r\nthrone, and not unsuspicious that it had the Emperor's sympathy,\r\ndeclined the honour and announced his intention of entering religion,\r\nwhich he did by retiring to the monastery at Yoshino. The\r\nconspirators, at whose head were the minister of the Left, Soga no\r\nAkae, and the minister of the Right, Nakatomi no Kane, aimed at\r\nreverting to the times when, by placing on the throne a prince of\r\ntheir own choice, one or two great uji had grasped the whole\r\npolitical power. The prime mover was Kane, muraji of the Nakatomi.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Tenchi's death, which took place at the close of\r\n671, and after the accession of Prince Otomo--known in history as the\r\nEmperor Kobun--the conspirators began to concert measures for the\r\ndestruction of Prince Oama, whom they regarded as a fatal obstacle to\r\nthe achievement of their purpose. But the Emperor Kobun's consort,\r\nToichi, was a daughter of Prince Oama, and two sons of the latter,\r\nTakaichi and Otsu, were also in the Court at Omi. By these three\r\npersons Yoshino was kept fully informed of everything happening at\r\nOmi. Oama fled precipitately. He did not even wait for a palanquin or\r\na horse. His course was shaped eastward, for two reasons: the first,\r\nthat his domains as Prince Imperial had been in Ise and Mino; the\r\nsecond, that since in the eastern provinces the Daika reforms had\r\nbeen first put into operation, in the eastern provinces, also,\r\nconservatism might be expected to rebel with least reluctance.\r\n\r\nThe struggle that ensued was the fiercest Japan had witnessed since\r\nthe foundation of the empire. For twenty days there was almost\r\ncontinuous fighting. The prince's first measure was to block the\r\npasses on the eastward high-roads, so that the Omi forces could not\r\nreach him till he was fully ready to receive them. Thousands flocked\r\nto his standard, and he was soon able to assume the offensive. On the\r\nother hand, those whom the Omi Court summoned to arms declined for\r\nthe most part to respond. The nation evidently regarded Prince Oama\r\nas the champion of the old against the new. The crowning contest took\r\nplace at the Long Bridge of Seta, which spans the waters of Lake Biwa\r\nat the place where they narrow to form the Seta River. Deserted by\r\nmen who had sworn to support him, his army shattered, and he himself\r\na fugitive, the Emperor fled to Yamazaki and there committed suicide.\r\nHis principal instigator, muraji of the Nakatomi and minister of the\r\nRight, with eight other high officials, suffered the extreme penalty;\r\nAkae, omi of the Soga and minister of the Left, had to go into exile,\r\nbut the rest of Kobun's followers were pardoned. Not because of its\r\nmagnitude alone but because its sequel was the dethronement and\r\nsuicide of a legitimate Emperor, this struggle presents a shocking\r\naspect to Japanese eyes. It is known in history as the \"Jinshin\r\ndisturbance,\" so called after the cyclical designation of the year\r\n(672) when it occurred.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTIETH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR TEMMU (A.D. 673-686)\r\n\r\nPrince Oama succeeded to the throne and is known in history as the\r\nfortieth Sovereign, Temmu. During the fourteen years of his reign he\r\ncompleted the administrative systems of the Daika era, and asserted\r\nthe dignity and authority of the Court to an unprecedented degree.\r\nAmong the men who espoused his cause in the Jinshin struggle there\r\nare found many names of aristocrats who boasted high titles and owned\r\nhereditary estates. Whatever hopes these conservatives entertained of\r\na reversion to the old-time-order of things, they were signally\r\ndisappointed. The Daika reformers had invariably contrived that\r\nconciliation should march hand in hand with innovation. Temmu relied\r\non coercion. He himself administered State affairs with little\r\nrecourse to ministerial aid but always with military assistance in\r\nthe background. He was especially careful not to sow the seeds of the\r\nabuses which his immediate predecessors had worked to eradicate.\r\nThus, while he did not fail to recognize the services of those that\r\nhad stood by him in the Jinshin tumult, he studiously refrained from\r\nrewarding them with official posts, and confined himself to bestowing\r\ntitles of a purely personal character together with posthumous rank\r\nin special cases.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that in the so-called \"code\" of Shotoku Taishi\r\nprominent attention was directed to the obligations of decorum. This\r\nprinciple received much elaboration in Temmu's reign. A law,\r\ncomprising no less than ninety-two articles, was enacted for guidance\r\nin Court ceremonials, the demeanour and salutation of each grade of\r\nofficials being explicitly set forth. It is worthy of note that a\r\nveto was imposed on the former custom of kneeling to make obeisance\r\nand advancing or retreating in the presence of a superior on the\r\nknees and hands; all salutations were ordered to be made standing.\r\nFurther, the clear differentiation of official functions, which had\r\nbeen commenced under the sway of Tenchi, was completed in this reign.\r\n\r\nBut, though relying on military force in the last resort, Temmu did\r\nnot neglect appeals to religion and devices to win popularity. On the\r\none hand, we find him establishing a War-Office (Heisei-kan) and\r\nmaking it second in grade and importance to the Privy Council\r\n(Dajo-kwan) alone; on the other, he is seen endowing shrines,\r\nerecting temples, and organizing religious fetes on a sumptuous\r\nscale. If, again, all persons in official position were required to\r\nsupport armed men; if the provincials were ordered to practise\r\nmilitary exercises, and if arms were distributed to the people in the\r\nhome provinces (Kinai), at the same time taxes were freely remitted,\r\nand amnesties were readily granted. Further, if much attention was\r\npaid to archery, and if drastic measures were adopted to crush the\r\npartisans of the Omi Court who still occasionally raised the standard\r\nof revolt, the sovereign devoted not less care to the discharge of\r\nthe administrative functions, and his legislation extended even to\r\nthe realm of fishery, where stake-nets and other methods of an\r\ninjurious nature were strictly interdicted. The eating of flesh was\r\nprohibited, but whether this veto was issued in deference to Buddhism\r\nor from motives of economy, there is no evidence to show.\r\n\r\nOne very noteworthy feature of Temmu's administration was that he\r\nnever appointed to posts in the Government men who did not give\r\npromise of competence. All those who possessed a claim on his\r\ngratitude were nominated chamberlains (toneri), and having been thus\r\nbrought under observation, were subsequently entrusted with official\r\nfunctions commensurate with their proved ability. The same plan was\r\npursued in the case of females. With regard to the titles conferred\r\nby this sovereign in recognition of meritorious services, they were\r\ndesigned to replace the old-time kabane (or sei), in that whereas the\r\nkabane had always been hereditary, and was generally associated with\r\nan office, the new sei was obtained by special grant, and, though it\r\nthereafter became hereditary, it was never an indication of office\r\nbearing. Eight of these new titles were instituted by Temmu, namely,\r\nmahito, asomi, sukune, imiki, michi-no-shi, omi, muraji, and inagi,\r\nand their nearest English equivalents are, perhaps, duke, marquis,\r\ncount, lord, viscount, baron, and baronet. It is unnecessary to give\r\nany etymological analysis of these terms; their order alone is\r\nimportant. But two points have to be noted. The first is that the\r\ntitle imiki was generally that chosen for bestowal on naturalized\r\nforeigners; the second, that a conspicuously low place in the list is\r\ngiven to the revered old titles, ami and muraji. This latter feature\r\nis significant. The new peerage was, in fact, designed not only to\r\nsupplant, but also to discredit, the old.\r\n\r\nThus, in the first place, the system was abolished under which all\r\nuji having the title of omi were controlled by the o-omi, and all\r\nhaving the title of muraji by the o-muraji; and in the second, though\r\nthe above eight sei were established, not every uji was necessarily\r\ngranted a title. Only the most important received that distinction,\r\nand even these found themselves relegated to a comparatively low\r\nplace on the list. All the rest, however, were permitted to use their\r\nold, but now depreciated kabane, and no change was made in the\r\ntraditional custom of entrusting the management of each uji's affairs\r\nto its own Kami. But, in order to guard against the abuses of the\r\nhereditary right, an uji no Kami ceased in certain cases to succeed\r\nby birthright and became elective, the election requiring Imperial\r\nendorsement.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these measures was almost revolutionary. They changed\r\nthe whole fabric of the Japanese polity. But in spite of all Temmu's\r\nprecautions to accomplish the centralization of power, success was\r\nmenaced by a factor which could scarcely have been controlled. The\r\narable lands in the home provinces at that time probably did not\r\nexceed 130,000 acres, and the food stuffs produced cannot have\r\nsufficed for more than a million persons. As for the forests, their\r\ncapacities were ill developed, and thus it fell out that the\r\nsustenance fiefs granted to omi and muraji of the lower grades did\r\nnot exceed a few acres. Gradually, as families multiplied, the\r\nconditions of life became too straightened in such circumstances, and\r\nrelief began to be sought in provincial appointments, which furnished\r\nopportunities for getting possession of land. It was in this way that\r\nlocal magnates had their origin and the seeds of genuine feudalism\r\nwere sown. Another direction in which success fell short of purpose\r\nwas in the matter of the hereditary guilds (be). The Daika reforms\r\nhad aimed at converting everyone in the empire into a veritable unit\r\nof the nation, not a mere member of an uji or a tomobe. But it proved\r\nimpossible to carry out this system in the case of the tomobe (called\r\nalso kakibe), or labouring element of the uji, and the yakabe, or\r\ndomestic servants of a family. To these their old status had to be\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-FIRST SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS JITO (A.D. 690-697)\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Temmu died in 686, and the throne remained nominally\r\nunoccupied until 690. A similar interregnum had separated the\r\naccession of Tenchi from the death of his predecessor, the Empress\r\nSaimei, and both events were due to a cognate cause. Tenchi did not\r\nwish that his reforms should be directly associated with the Throne\r\nuntil their success was assured; Temmu desired that the additions\r\nmade by him to the Daika system should be consolidated by the genius\r\nof his wife before the sceptre passed finally into the hands of his\r\nson. Jito had stood by her husband's side when, as Prince Oama, he\r\nhad barely escaped the menaces of the Omi Court, and there is reason\r\nto think that she had subsequently shared his administrative\r\nconfidence as she had assisted at his military councils. The heir to\r\nthe throne, Prince Kusakabe, was then in his twenty-fifth year, but\r\nhe quietly endorsed the paternal behest that his mother should direct\r\nState affairs. The arrangement was doubtless intended to be\r\ntemporary, but Kusakabe died three years later, and yielding to the\r\nsolicitations of her ministers, Jito then (690) finally ascended the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nHer reign, however, was not entirely free from the family strife\r\nwhich too often accompanied a change of sovereigns in Japan's early\r\ndays. In addition to his legitimate offspring, Kusakabe, the Emperor\r\nTemmu left several sons by secondary consorts, and the eldest\r\nsurvivor of these, Prince Otsu, listening to the counsels of the Omi\r\nCourt's partisans and prompted by his own well-deserved popularity\r\nand military prowess, intrigued to seize the throne. He was executed\r\nin his house, and his fate is memorable for two reasons: the first,\r\nthat his young wife, Princess Yamanobe, \"hastened thither with her\r\nhair dishevelled and her feet bare and joined him in death;\" the\r\nsecond, that all his followers, over thirty in number, were\r\npardoned--rare clemency in those days. Prince Otsu is said to have\r\ninaugurated a pastime which afterwards became very popular--the\r\ncomposition of Chinese verses.\r\n\r\nSLAVES\r\n\r\nThe most important legislation of the Empress Jito's reign related to\r\nslaves.* In the year of her accession (690), she issued an edict\r\nordering that interest on all debts contracted prior to, or during\r\nthe year (685) prior to Temmu's death should be cancelled. Temmu\r\nhimself had created the precedent for this. When stricken by mortal\r\nillness, he had proclaimed remission of all obligations, \"whether in\r\nrice or in valuables,\" incurred on or before the last day of the\r\npreceding year. But Jito's edict had a special feature. It provided\r\nthat anyone already in servitude on account of a debt should be\r\nrelieved from serving any longer on account of the interest. Thus it\r\nis seen that the practice of pledging the service of one's body in\r\ndischarge of debt was in vogue at that epoch, and that it received\r\nofficial recognition with the proviso that the obligation must not\r\nextend to interest. Debts, therefore, had become instruments for\r\nswelling the ranks of the slave class.\r\n\r\n*The senmin, or slave class, was divided into two groups, namely,\r\npublic slaves (kwanko ryoko, and ko-nuhi), and private slaves (kenin\r\nand shi-nuhi).\r\n\r\nBut while sanctioning this evil custom, the tendency of the law was\r\nto minimize its results. In another edict of the same reign it was\r\nlaid down that, when a younger brother of the common people\r\n(hyakusei) was sold by his elder brother, the former should still be\r\nclassed as a freeman (ryomin), but a child sold by its father became\r\na serf (senmin); that service rendered to one of the senmin class by\r\na freeman in payment of a debt must not affect the status of the\r\nfreeman, and that the children of freemen so serving, even though\r\nborn of a union with a slave, should be reckoned as freemen. It has\r\nbeen shown already that degradation to slavery was a common\r\npunishment or expiation of a crime, and the annals of the period\r\nunder consideration indicate that men and women of the slave class\r\nwere bought and sold like any other chattels. Documents certainly not\r\nof more recent date than the ninth century, show particulars of some\r\nof these transactions. One runs as follows:\r\n\r\n   Men   (nu)       3\r\n   Women (hi)       3\r\n                   --\r\n   Total            6\r\n\r\n   2 at 10000 bundles of rice each\r\n   2 at   800 bundles of rice each.\r\n   1 at   700 bundles of rice.\r\n   1 at   600 bundles of rice.\r\n        -----\r\n   Total 4900 bundles\r\n\r\n   1 man (nu) named Kokatsu; age 34; with a mole under the left eye\r\n   Price 1000 bundles of rice.\r\n   The above are slaves of Kannawo Oba of Okambe in Yamagata district.\r\n\r\nComparison of several similar vouchers indicates that the usual price\r\nof an able-bodied slave was one thousand bundles of rice, and as one\r\nbundle gave five sho of unhulled rice, one thousand bundles\r\nrepresented fifty koku, which, in the modern market, would sell for\r\nabout six hundred yen. It is not to be inferred, however, that the\r\nsale of freemen into slavery was sanctioned by law. During the reign\r\nof the Emperor Temmu, a farmer of Shimotsuke province wished to sell\r\nhis child on account of a bad harvest, but his application for\r\npermission was refused, though forwarded by the provincial governor.\r\nIn fact, sales or purchases of the junior members of a family by the\r\nseniors were not publicly permitted, although such transactions\r\nevidently took place. Even the manumission of a slave required\r\nofficial sanction. Thus it is recorded that, in the reign of the\r\nEmpress Jito, Komaro, an asomi, asked and obtained the Court's\r\npermission to grant their freedom to six hundred slaves in his\r\npossession. Another rule enacted in Jito's time was that the slaves\r\nof an uji, when once manumitted, could not be again placed on the\r\nslaves' register at the request of a subsequent uji no Kami. Finally\r\nthis same sovereign enacted that yellow-coloured garments should be\r\nworn by freemen and black by slaves. History shows that the sale and\r\npurchase of human beings in Japan, subject to the above limitations,\r\nwas not finally forbidden until the year 1699.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the Emperors Kotoku and Temmu attached much\r\nimportance to the development of military efficiency and that they\r\nissued orders with reference to the training of provincials, the\r\narmed equipment of the people, the storage of weapons of war, and the\r\nmaintenance of men-at-arms by officials. Compulsory service, however,\r\ndoes not appear to have been inaugurated until the reign of the\r\nEmpress Jito, when (689) her Majesty instructed the local governors\r\nthat one-fourth of the able-bodied men in each province should be\r\ntrained every year in warlike exercises. This was the beginning of\r\nthe conscription system in Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF SUCCESSION OF THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThat the throne should be occupied by members of the Imperial family\r\nonly had been a recognized principle of the Japanese polity from\r\nremotest epochs. But there had been an early departure from the rule\r\nof primogeniture, and since the time of Nintoku the eligibility of\r\nbrothers also had been acknowledged in practice. To this latitude of\r\nchoice many disturbances were attributable, notably the fell Jinshin\r\nstruggle, and the terrors of that year were still fresh in men's\r\nminds when, during Jito's reign, the deaths of two Crown Princes in\r\nsuccession brought up the dangerous problem again for solution. The\r\nprinces were Kusakabe and Takaichi. The former had been nominated by\r\nhis father, Temmu, but was instructed to leave the reins of power in\r\nthe hands of his mother, Jito, for a time. He died in the year 689,\r\nwhile Jito was still regent, and Takaichi, another of Temmu's sons,\r\nwho had distinguished himself as commander of a division of troops in\r\nthe Jinshin campaign, was made Prince Imperial. But he too died in\r\n696, and it thus fell out that the only surviving and legitimate\r\noffspring of an Emperor who had actually reigned was Prince Kuzuno,\r\nson of Kobun.\r\n\r\nTo his accession, however, there was this great objection that his\r\nfather, though wielding the sceptre for a few months, had borne arms\r\nin the Jinshin disturbance against Temmu and Jito, and was held to\r\nhave forfeited his title by defeat and suicide. His assumption of the\r\nsceptre would have created a most embarrassing situation, and his\r\nenforced disqualification might have led to trouble. In this dilemma,\r\nthe Empress convened a State council, Prince Kuzuno also being\r\npresent, and submitted the question for their decision. But none\r\nreplied until Kuzuno himself, coming forward, declared that unless\r\nthe principle of primogeniture were strictly followed, endless\r\ncomplications would be inevitable. This involved the sacrifice of his\r\nown claim and the recognition of Karu, eldest son of the late\r\nKusakabe. The 14th of March, 696, when this patriotic declaration was\r\nmade, is memorable in Japanese history as the date when the principle\r\nof primogeniture first received official approval. Six months\r\nafterwards, the Empress abdicated in favour of Prince Karu, known in\r\nhistory as forty-second sovereign, Mommu. She herself was honoured by\r\nher successor with the title of Dajo-Tenno (Great Superior).\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ONE OF THE ORNAMENTAL GATES USED IN JAPANESE GARDENS\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SWORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DAIHO LAWS AND THE YORO LAWS\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-SECOND SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR MOMMU (A.D. 697-707)\r\n\r\nTHE Emperor Mommu took for consort a daughter of Fuhito,\r\nrepresentative of the Fujiwara family and son of the great Kamatari.\r\nShe did not receive the title of Empress, that distinction having\r\nbeen hitherto strictly confined to spouses chosen from a Kwobetsu\r\nfamily, whereas the Fujiwara belonged to the Shimbetsu. But this\r\nunion proved the first step towards a practice which soon became\r\nhabitual and which produced a marked effect on the history of Japan,\r\nthe practice of supplying Imperial consorts from the Fujiwara family.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIHO LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nOn Mommu's accession the year-period took his name, that being then\r\nthe custom unless some special reason suggested a different epithet.\r\nSuch a reason was the discovery of gold in Tsushima in 701, and in\r\nconsequence the year-name was altered to Daiho (Great Treasure). It\r\nis a period memorable for legislative activity. The reader is aware\r\nthat, during the reign of Tenchi, a body of statutes in twenty-two\r\nvolumes was compiled under the name of Omi Ritsu-ryo, or the \"Code\r\nand Penal Law of Omi,\" so called because the Court then resided at\r\nShiga in Omi. History further relates that these statutes were\r\nrevised by the Emperor Mommu, who commenced the task in 681 and that,\r\neleven years later, when the Empress Jito occupied the throne, this\r\nrevised code was promulgated.\r\n\r\nBut neither in its original nor in its revised form has it survived,\r\nand the inference is that in practice it was found in need of a\r\nsecond revision, which took place in the years 700 and 701 under\r\ninstructions from the Emperor Mommu, the revisers being a committee\r\nof ten, headed by Fuhito of the Fujiwara family, and by Mahito (Duke)\r\nAwada. There resulted eleven volumes of the Code (ryo) and six of the\r\nPenal Law (ritsu), and these were at once promulgated, expert jurists\r\nbeing despatched, at the same time, to various quarters to expound\r\nthe new legislation. Yet again, seventeen years later (718), by order\r\nof the Empress Gensho, revision was carried out by another committee\r\nheaded by the same Fujiwara Fuhito, now prime minister, and the\r\namended volumes, ten of the Code and ten of the Law, were known\r\nthenceforth as the \"New Statutes,\" or the \"Code and Law of the Yoro\r\nPeriod.\" They were supplemented by a body of official rules (kyaku)\r\nand operative regulations (shiki), the whole forming a very elaborate\r\nassemblage of laws.\r\n\r\nThe nature and scope of the code will be sufficiently understood from\r\nthe titles of its various sections: (1) Official Titles; (2) Duties\r\nof Officials; (3) Duties of Officials of the Empress' Household; (4)\r\nDuties of Officials in the Household of the Heir Apparent; (5) Duties\r\nof Officials in the Households of Officers of High Rank; (6) Services\r\nto the Gods; (7) Buddhist Priests; (8) the Family; (9) the Land; (10)\r\nTaxation; (11) Learning; (12) Official Ranks and Titles; (13) The\r\nDescent of the Crown and Dignities of Imperial Persons; (14)\r\nMeritorious Discharge of Official Duties; (15) Salaries; (16) Court\r\nGuards; (17) Army and Frontier Defences; (18) Ceremonies; (19)\r\nOfficial Costumes; (20) Public Works; (21) Mode of addressing Persons\r\nof Rank; (22) Stores of Rice and other Grain; (23) Stables and\r\nFodder; (24) Duties of Medical Officers attached to the Court; (25)\r\nOfficial Vacations; (26) Funerals and Mourning; (27) Watch and Ward\r\nand Markets; (28) Arrest of Criminals; (29) Jails, and (30)\r\nMiscellaneous, including Bailment, Finding of Lost Goods, etc.*\r\n\r\nThis \"Code and the Penal Law\" accompanying it went into full\r\noperation from the Daiho era and remained in force thereafter,\r\nsubject to the revisions above indicated. There is no reason to doubt\r\nthat the highly artificial organization of society which such\r\nstatutes indicate, existed, in outline at all events, from the reign\r\nof Kotoku, but its plainly legalized reality dates, so far as history\r\nis concerned, from the Daiho era. As for the rules (kyaku) and\r\nregulations (shiki), they were re-drafted: first, in the Konin era\r\n(810-824) by a commission under the direction of the grand\r\ncouncillor,* Fujiwara Fuyutsugu; next, in the Jokwan era (859-877) by\r\nFujiwara Ujimune and others, and finally in the Engi era (901-923) by\r\na committee with Fujiwara Tadahira for president. These three sets of\r\nprovisions were spoken of in subsequent ages as the \"Rules and\r\nRegulations of the Three Generations\" (Sandai-kyaku-shiki). It will\r\nbe observed that just as this remarkable body of enactments owed its\r\ninception in Japan to Kamatari, the great founder of the Fujiwara\r\nfamily, so every subsequent revision was presided over by one of his\r\ndescendants. The thirty sections of the code comprise 949 articles,\r\nwhich are all extant, but of the penal laws in twelve sections there\r\nremain only 322 articles.\r\n\r\n*Tarring, in the \"Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be broadly stated that the Daika reformation, which formed the\r\nbasis of this legislation, was a transition from the Japanese system\r\nof heredity to the Chinese system of morality. The penal law (ritsu),\r\nalthough its Chinese original has not survived for purposes of\r\ncomparison, was undoubtedly copied from the work of the Tang\r\nlegislators, the only modification being in degrees of punishment;\r\nbut the code, though it, too, was partially exotic in character,\r\nevidently underwent sweeping alterations so as to bring it into\r\nconformity with Japanese customs and traditions. Each of the\r\nrevisions recorded above must be assumed to have extended this\r\nadaptation.\r\n\r\nThe basic principle of the Daiho code was that the people at large,\r\nwithout regard to rank or pedigree, owed equal duty to the State;\r\nthat only those having special claims on public benevolence were\r\nentitled to fixed exemptions, and that not noble birth but\r\nintellectual capacity and attainments constituted a qualification for\r\noffice. Nevertheless Japanese legislators did not find it possible to\r\napply fully these excellent principles. Habits of a millennium's\r\ngrowth could not be so lightly eradicated. Traces of the old obtrude\r\nthemselves plainly from between the lines of the new. Thus the \"Law\r\nof Descent\" (Keishi-ryo), which formed the thirteenth section of the\r\ncode, was a special embodiment of Japanese social institutions,\r\nhaving no parallel in the Tang statutes, and further, while declaring\r\nerudition and intelligence to be the unique qualifications for\r\noffice, no adequate steps were taken to establish schools for\r\nimparting the former or developing the latter. In short, the nobles\r\nstill retained a large part of their old power, and the senmin\r\n(slave) class still continued to labour under various disabilities.\r\n\r\nThat several important provisions of the Land Code (Den-ryo) should\r\nhave fallen quickly into disuse will be easily comprehended when we\r\ncome presently to examine that system in detail, but for the neglect\r\nof portions of the Military Code (Gumbo-ryo), of the Code of Official\r\nRanks and Titles, and of the Code relating to the Meritorious\r\nDischarge of Official Duties, it is necessary to lay the\r\nresponsibility on the shoulders of the hereditary nobles, whose\r\ninfluence out-weighed the force of laws. It may indeed be broadly\r\nstated that the potency of the Daiho code varied in the direct ratio\r\nof the centralization of administrative authority. Whenever feudalism\r\nprevailed, the code lost its binding force. In the realm of criminal\r\nlaw it is only consistent with the teaching of all experience to find\r\nthat mitigation of penalties was provided according to the rank of\r\nthe culprit. There were eight major crimes (hachi-gyaku), all in the\r\nnature of offences against the State, the Court, and the family, and\r\nthe order of their gravity was: (1) high treason (against the State);\r\n(2) high treason (against the Crown); (3) treason; (4) parricide,\r\nfratricide, etc.; (5) offences against humanity; (6) lése majesté;\r\n(7) unfilial conduct, and (8) crimes against society. But there were\r\nalso six mitigations (roku-gi), all enacted with the object of\r\nlightening punishments according to the rank, official position, or\r\npublic services of an offender. As for slaves, being merely a part of\r\ntheir proprietor's property like any other goods and chattels, the\r\nlaw took no cognizance of them.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nUnder the Daiho code a more elaborate system of administrative\r\norganization was effected than that conceived by the Daika reformers.\r\nIn the Central Government there were two boards, eight departments,\r\nand one office, namely: (1). The Jingi-kwan, or Board of Religion\r\n(Shinto). This stood at the head of all, in recognition of the divine\r\norigin of the Imperial family. A Japanese work (Nihon Kodaiho\r\nShakugi) explains the fundamental tenet of the nation's creed thus:\r\n\"If a State has its origin in military prowess, which is essentially\r\nhuman, then by human agencies also a State may be overthrown. To be\r\nsecure against such vicissitudes a throne must be based upon\r\nsomething superior to man's potentialities. Divine authority alone\r\nfulfils that definition, and it is because the throne of Japan had a\r\nsuperhuman foundation that its existence is perennial. Therefore the\r\nJingi-kwan stands above all others in the State.\" In another, book\r\n(Jingi-ryo) we find it stated: \"All the deities* of heaven and earth\r\nare worshipped in the Jingi-kwan. On the day of the coronation the\r\nNakatomi performs service to the deities of heaven and the Imibe\r\nmakes offerings of three kinds of sacred articles.\"\r\n\r\n*The eight Kami specially worshipped in the Jingi-kwan were\r\nTaka-mi-musubi, Kammi-musubi, Tamatsume-musubi, Iku-musubi,\r\nTaru-musubi, Omiya no me, Miketsu, and Koto-shiro-nushi.\r\n\r\nThus, though the models for the Daiho system were taken from China,\r\nthey were adapted to Japanese customs and traditions, as is proved by\r\nthe premier place given to the Jingi-kwan. Worship and religious\r\nceremonial have always taken precedence of secular business in the\r\nCourt of Japan. Not only at the central seat of government did the\r\nyear commence with worship, but in the provinces, also, the first\r\nthing recorded by a newly appointed governor was his visit to the\r\nShinto shrines, and on the opening day of each month he repaired\r\nthither to offer the gohei.* Religious rites, in short, were the\r\nprime function of government, and therefore, whereas the office\r\ncharged with these duties ranked low in the Tang system, it was\r\nplaced at the head of all in Japan.\r\n\r\n*Angular bunches of white paper stripes, representing the cloth\r\nofferings originally tied to branches of the sacred cleyera tree at\r\nfestival time.\r\n\r\n(2). The Daijo-kwan (called also Dajo-kwari), or Board of Privy\r\nCouncil. This office ranked next to the Board of Religion and had the\r\nduty of superintending the eight State departments. Its personnel\r\nconsisted of the prime minister (daijo-daijin or dajo-daijin), the\r\nminister of the Left (sa-daijiri), and the minister of the Right\r\n(u-daijiri).\r\n\r\n(3). The Nakatsukasa-sho, or Central Department of State (literally,\r\n\"Intermediate Transacting Department\"), which was not an executive\r\noffice, its chief duties being to transmit the sovereign's decrees to\r\nthe authorities concerned and the memorials of the latter to the\r\nformer, as well as to discharge consultative functions.\r\n\r\n(4). The Shikibu-sho, or Department of Ceremonies. This office had to\r\nconsider and determine the promotion and degradation of officials\r\naccording to their competence and character.\r\n\r\n(5). The Jibu-sho, or Department of Civil Government, which examined\r\nand determined everything concerning the position of noblemen, and\r\nadministered affairs relating to priests, nuns, and members of the\r\nBambetsu,* that is to say, men of foreign nationality residing in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n*The reader is already familiar with the terms \"Kwobetsu\" and\r\n\"Shimbetsu.\" All aliens were classed as Bambetsu.\r\n\r\n(6). The Mimbu-sho, or Department of Civil Affairs. An office which\r\nmanaged affairs relating to the land and the people, to taxes and to\r\nforced services.\r\n\r\n(7). The Gyobu-sho, or Department of Justice.\r\n\r\n(8). The Okura-sho, or Department of Finance.\r\n\r\n(9). The Kunai-sho, or Imperial Household Department.\r\n\r\n(10). The Hyobu-sho, or Department of War.\r\n\r\n(11). The Danjo-dai, or Office of Censorship, This office had the\r\nduty of correcting civil customs and punishing and conduct on the\r\npart of officials. In the year 799, Kwammu being then on the throne,\r\na law was enacted for the Danjo-dai. It consisted of eighty-three\r\narticles, and it had the effect of greatly augmenting the powers of\r\nthe office. But in the period 810-829, it was found necessary to\r\norganize a special bureau of kebiishi, or executive police, to which\r\nthe functions of the Danjo-dai subsequently passed, as did also those\r\nof the Gyobu-sho in great part. These two boards, eight departments,\r\nand one office all had their locations within the palace enclosure,\r\nso that the Imperial Court and the Administration were not\r\ndifferentiated.\r\n\r\nLOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY\r\n\r\nFor administrative purposes the capital was divided into two\r\nsections, the Eastern and the Western, which were controlled by a\r\nLeft Metropolitan Office and a Right Metropolitan Office,\r\nrespectively. In Naniwa (Osaka) also, which ranked as a city of\r\nspecial importance, there was an executive office called the\r\nSettsu-shoku--Settsu being the name of the province in which the town\r\nstood--and in Chikuzen province there was the Dazai-fu (Great\r\nAdministrative Office), which had charge of foreign relations in\r\naddition to being the seat of the governor-generalship of the whole\r\nisland of Kyushu. In spite of its importance as an administrative\r\npost, the Dazai-fu, owing to its distance from the capital, came to\r\nbe regarded as a place of exile for high officials who had fallen out\r\nof Imperial favour.\r\n\r\nThe empire was divided into provinces (kuni) of four classes--great,\r\nsuperior, medium, and inferior,--and each province was subdivided\r\ninto districts (kori) of five classes--great, superior, medium,\r\ninferior, and small. The term \"province\" had existed from remote\r\nantiquity, but it represented at the outset a comparatively small\r\narea, for in the time of the Emperor Keitai (A.D. 507-531), there\r\nwere 144 kuni. This number was largely reduced in the sequel of\r\nsurveys and re-adjustments of boundaries during the Daika era\r\n(645-650), and after the Daiho reforms (701-704) it stood at\r\nfifty-eight, but subsequently, at an uncertain date, it grew to\r\nsixty-six and remained permanently thus. The kori (district) of the\r\nDaika and Daiho reforms had originally been called agata (literally\r\n\"arable land\"), and had been subdivided into inaki (granary) and mura\r\n(village). A miyatsuko had administered the affairs of the kuni,\r\nholding the office by hereditary right, and the agata of which there\r\nwere about 590, a frequently changing total as well as the inaki and\r\nthe mura had been under officials called nushi. But according to the\r\nDaika and Daiho systems, each kuni was placed under a governor\r\n(kokushi), chosen on account of competence and appointed for a term\r\nof four years; each district (kori) was administered by a cho\r\n(chief).\r\n\r\nMILITARY INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nIn the capital there were three bodies of guards; namely, the emon-fu\r\n(gate guards); the sa-eji-fu and the u-eji-fu (Left and Right\r\nwatches). There was also the sa-ma-ryo and the u-ma-ryo (cavalry of\r\nthe Left and of the Right), and the sa-hyogo-ryo and the u-hyogo-ryo\r\n(Left and Right Departments of Supply). These divisions into \"left\"\r\nand \"right,\" and the precedence given to the left, were derived from\r\nChina, but it has to be observed in Japan's case that the metropolis\r\nitself was similarly divided into left and right quarters. Outside\r\nthe capital each province had an army corps (gundan), and one-third\r\nof all the able-bodied men (seitei), from the age of twenty to that\r\nof sixty, were required to serve with the colours of an army corps\r\nfor a fixed period each year. From these provincial troops drafts\r\nwere taken every year for a twelve-month's duty as palace guards\r\n(eji) in the metropolis, and others were detached for three-years'\r\nservice as frontier guards (saki-mori) in the provinces lying along\r\nthe western sea board.\r\n\r\nThe army corps differed numerically according to the extent of the\r\nprovince where they had their headquarters, but for each thousand men\r\nthere were one colonel (taiki) and two lieutenant-colonels (shoki);\r\nfor every five hundred men, one major (gunki); for every two hundred,\r\none captain (koi); for every one hundred, a lieutenant (ryosui), and\r\nfor every fifty, a sergeant-major (taisei). As for the privates, they\r\nwere organized in groups of five (go); ten (kwa), and fifty (tai).\r\nThose who could draw a bow and manage a horse were enrolled in the\r\ncavalry, the rest being infantry. From each tai two specially robust\r\nmen were selected as archers, and for each kwa there were six\r\npack-horses. The equipment of a soldier on campaign included a large\r\nsword (tachi) and a small sword (katana or sashi-zoe) together with a\r\nquiver (yanagui or ebira); but in time of peace these were kept in\r\nstore, the daily exercises being confined to the use of the spear,\r\nthe catapult (ishi-yumi) and the bow, and to the practice of\r\nhorsemanship. When several army corps were massed to the number of\r\nten thousand or more, their staff consisted of a general (shogun),\r\ntwo lieutenant-generals (fuku-shogun), two army-inspectors (gunkan),\r\nfour secretaries (rokuji), and four sergeants (gunso). If more than\r\none such force took the field, the whole was commanded by a\r\ngeneral-in-chief.\r\n\r\nAPPOINTMENT AND PROMOTION\r\n\r\nThe law provided that appointment to office and promotion should\r\ndepend, not upon rank, but upon knowledge and capacity. Youths who\r\nhad graduated at the university were divided into three categories:\r\nnamely, those of eminent talent (shusai); those having extensive\r\nknowledge of the Chinese classics (meikei), and those advanced in\r\nknowledge (shinshi). Official vacancies were filled from these three\r\nclasses in the order here set down, and promotion subsequently\r\ndepended on proficiency. But though thus apparently independent of\r\ninherited rank, the law was not so liberal in reality. For admission\r\nto the portals of the university was barred to all except nobles or\r\nthe sons and grandsons of literati. Scions of noble families down to\r\nthe fifth rank had the right of entry, and scions of nobles of the\r\nsixth, seventh, and eighth ranks were admitted by nomination.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL EMOLUMENT\r\n\r\nRemuneration to officials took the form of revenue derived from lands\r\nand houses, but this subject can be treated more intelligently when\r\nwe come to speak of the land.\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nAccording to the Daiho laws one family constituted a household. But\r\nthe number of a family was not limited: it included brothers and\r\ntheir wives and children, as well as male and female servants, so\r\nthat it might comprise as many as one hundred persons. The eldest\r\nlegitimate son was the head of the household, and its representative\r\nin the eyes of the law. A very minute census was kept. Children up to\r\nthree years of age were classed as \"yellow\" (kwo); those between\r\nthree and sixteen, as \"little\" (sho); those members of the household\r\nbetween sixteen and twenty, as \"middling\" (chu); those between twenty\r\nand sixty, as \"able-bodied\" (tei), and those above sixty as \"old\" or\r\n\"invalids,\" so as to secure their exemption from forced labour\r\n(kayaku or buyaku). The census was revised every six years, two\r\ncopies of the revised document being sent to the privy council\r\n(Daijo-kwan) and one kept in the district concerned. It was\r\ncustomary, however, to preserve permanently the census of every\r\nthirtieth year* for purposes of record, and moreover the census taken\r\nin the ninth year of Tenchi's reign (670)** was also kept as a\r\nreference for personal names. To facilitate the preservation of good\r\norder and morality, each group of five households was formed into an\r\n\"association of five\" (goho or gonin-gumi) with a recognized head\r\n(hocho); and fifty households constituted a village (sato or mura),\r\nwhich was the smallest administrative unit. The village had a mayor\r\n(richo), whose functions were to keep a record of the number of\r\npersons in each household; to encourage diligence in agriculture and\r\nsericulture; to reprove, and, if necessary, to report all evil\r\nconduct, and to stimulate the discharge of public service. Thus the\r\ndistrict chief (guncho or gunryo) had practically little to do beyond\r\nsuperintending the richo.\r\n\r\n*This was called gohi-seki; i.e., comparative record for a period of\r\nfive times six years.\r\n\r\n**It was designated the Kogoanen-seki, from the cyclical name of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nTHE LAND\r\n\r\nThe land laws of the Daiho era, like those of the Daika, were based\r\non the hypothesis that all land throughout the country was the\r\nproperty of the Crown, and that upon the latter devolved the\r\nresponsibility of equitable distribution among the people. Rice being\r\nthe chief staple of diet and also the standard of exchange,\r\nrice-lands--that is to say, irrigated fields--were regarded as most\r\nimportant. The law--already referred to in connexion with the Daika\r\nera but here cited again for the sake of clearness--enacted that all\r\npersons, on attaining the age of five, became entitled to two tan of\r\nsuch land, females receiving two-thirds of that amount. Land thus\r\nallotted was called kubun-den, or \"sustenance land\" (literally,\r\n\"mouth-share land\"). The tan was taken for unit, because it\r\nrepresented 360 bu (or ho), and as the rice produced on one bu\r\nconstituted one day's ration for an adult male, a tan yielded enough\r\nfor one year (the year being 360 days).*\r\n\r\n*The bu in early times represented 5 shaku square, or 25 square shaku\r\n(1 seki = 1 foot very nearly); but as the shaku (10 sun) then\r\nmeasured 2 sun (1 sun = 1.2 inch) more than the shaku of later ages,\r\nthe modern bu (or tsubo) is a square of 6 shaku side, or 36 square\r\nshaku, though in actual dimensions the ancient and the modern are\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nThe theory of distribution was that the produce of one tan served for\r\nfood, while with the produce of the second tan the cost of clothes\r\nand so forth was defrayed. The Daika and Daiho legislators alike laid\r\ndown the principle that rice-fields thus allotted should be held for\r\na period of six years only, after which they were to revert to the\r\nCrown for redistribution, and various detailed regulations were\r\ncompiled to meet contingencies that might arise in carrying out the\r\nsystem. But, of course, it proved quite unpracticable, and though\r\nthat lesson obviously remained unlearned during the cycle that\r\nseparated the Daika and the Daiho periods, there is good reason to\r\nthink that these particular provisions of the land law (Den-ryo) soon\r\nbecame a dead letter.\r\n\r\nA different method was pursued, however, in the case of uplands (as\r\ndistinguished from wet fields). These--called onchi*--were parcelled\r\nout among the families residing in a district, without distinction\r\nof age or sex, and were held in perpetuity, never reverting to the\r\nCrown unless a family became extinct. Such land might be bought or\r\nsold--except to a Buddhist temple--but its tenure was conditional\r\nupon planting from one hundred to three hundred mulberry trees\r\n(for purposes of sericulture) and from forty to one hundred\r\nlacquer trees, according to the grade of the tenant family.\r\nOwnership of building-land (takuchi) was equally in perpetuity,\r\nthough its transfer required official approval, but dwellings or\r\nwarehouses--which in Japan have always been regarded as distinct from\r\nthe land on which they stand--might be disposed of at pleasure. It\r\nis not to be inferred from the above that all the land throughout\r\nthe Empire was divided among the people. Considerable tracts\r\nwere reserved for special purposes. Thus, in five home provinces\r\n(Go-Kinai) two tracts of seventy-five acres each were kept for the\r\nCourt in Yamato and Settsu, and two tracts of thirty acres each in\r\nKawachi and Yamashiro, such land being known as kwanden (official\r\nfields), and being under the direct control of the Imperial Household\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n*Called also yenchi--These uplands were regarded as of little value\r\ncompared with rice-fields.\r\n\r\nThere were also three other kinds of special estates, namely, iden,\r\nor lands granted to mark official ranks; shokubunden, or lands given\r\nas salary to office-holders; and koden, or lands bestowed in\r\nrecognition of merit. As to the iden, persons of the four Imperial\r\nranks received from one hundred to two hundred acres, and persons\r\nbelonging to any of the five official grades--in each of which there\r\nwere two classes--were given from twenty to two hundred, females\r\nreceiving two-thirds of a male's allotment. Coming to salary lands,\r\nwe find a distinction between officials serving in the capital\r\n(zaikyo) and those serving in the provinces (zaige). Among the\r\nformer, the principal were the prime minister (one hundred acres),\r\nthe ministers of the Left and Right (seventy-five acres each) and the\r\ngreat councillor (fifty acres). As for provincial officials, the\r\nhighest, namely, the governor of Kyushu (who had his seat at the\r\nDazai-fu), received twenty-five acres, and the lowest, one and a half\r\nacres. Governors of provinces--which were divided into four classes\r\n(great, superior, medium, and inferior)--received from four acres to\r\nsix and a half acres; an official (dai-hanji), corresponding to a\r\nchief-justice, had five acres; a puisne justice (sho-hanji), four\r\nacres; an officer in command of an army corps, four acres, and a\r\nliterary professor (hakushi), four acres. Grants of land as salaries\r\nfor official duties were made even to post-towns for the purpose of\r\ndefraying the expense of coolies and horses for official use.\r\nFinally, there were koden, or lands bestowed in recognition of\r\ndistinguished public services. Of such services four grades were\r\ndifferentiated: namely, \"great merit\" (taiko), for which the grant\r\nwas made in perpetuity; \"superior merit\" (joko), which was rewarded\r\nwith land held for three generations; \"medium merit\" (chuko), in\r\nwhich case the land-title had validity to the second generation only,\r\nand \"inferior merit\" (geko), where the land did not descend beyond a\r\nson or a daughter. It is worthy of note that in determining the order\r\nof eligibility for grants of sustenance land (kubunden), preference\r\nwas given to the poor above the rich, and that the officials in a\r\nprovince were allowed to cultivate unoccupied land for their own\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nTAXATION\r\n\r\nThere were three kinds of imposts; namely, tax (so), forced service\r\n(yo or kayaku) and tribute (cho). The tax was three per cent, of the\r\ngross produce of the land--namely, three sheaves of rice out of every\r\nhundred in the case of a male, and two out of sixty-six in the case\r\nof a female. The tribute was much more important, for it meant that\r\nevery able-bodied male had to pay a fixed quantity of silk-fabric,\r\npongee, raw-silk, raw-cotton, indigo (675 grains troy), rouge (the\r\nsame quantity), copper (two and a quarter lbs.), and, if in an\r\nImperial domain, an additional piece of cotton cloth, thirteen feet\r\nlong. Finally, the forced service meant thirty days' labour annually\r\nfor each able-bodied male and fifteen days for a minor. Sometimes\r\nthis compulsory service might be commuted at the rate of two and a\r\nhalf feet of cotton cloth for each day's work. Exemption from forced\r\nlabour was granted to persons of and above the grade of official rank\r\nand to their families through three generations; to persons of and\r\nabove the fifth grade and to their families for two generations; to\r\nmen of the Imperial blood; to the sick, the infirm, the deformed,\r\nfemales, and slaves. Forced labourers were allowed to rest from noon\r\nto 4 P.M. in July and August. They were not required to work at\r\nnight. If they fell sick so as to be unable to labour out of doors,\r\nthey were allowed only half rations. If they were taken ill on their\r\nway to their place of work, they were left to the care of the local\r\nauthorities and fed at public charge. If they died, a coffin was\r\nfurnished out of the public funds, and the corpse, unless claimed,\r\nwas cremated, the ashes being buried by the wayside and a mark set\r\nup. Precise rules as to inheritance were laid down. A mother and a\r\nstep-mother ranked equally with the eldest son for that purpose, each\r\nreceiving two parts; younger sons received one part, and concubines\r\nand female children received one-half of a part. There were also\r\nstrict rules as to the measure of relief from taxation granted in the\r\nevent of crop-failure.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF DAIHO LAWS\r\n\r\nWhat has been set down above constitutes only a petty fraction of the\r\nDaiho legislation, but it will suffice to furnish an idea of Japanese\r\ncivilization in the eighth century of the Christian era a\r\ncivilization which shared with that of China the credit of being the\r\nmost advanced in the world at that time.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HATSUNE-NO-TANA (A Gold-lacquered Stand or Cabinet)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: STATUES OF SHAKA AND TWO BOSATSUS IN THE KONDO OF THE\r\nHORYU-JI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE NARA EPOCH\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-THIRD SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS GEMMYO (A.D. 708-715)\r\n\r\nTHE Empress Gemmyo, fourth daughter of the Emperor Tenchi and consort\r\nof Prince Kusakabe, was the mother of the Emperor Mommu, whose\r\naccession had been the occasion of the first formal declaration of\r\nthe right of primogeniture (vide Chapter XV). Mommu, dying, willed\r\nthat the throne should be occupied by his mother in trust for his\r\ninfant son--afterwards Emperor Shomu.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL TO NARA\r\n\r\nIn ancient times it was customary to change the locality of the\r\nImperial capital with each change of sovereign. This custom, dictated\r\nby the Shinto conception of impurity attaching to sickness and death,\r\nexercised a baleful influence on architectural development, and\r\nconstituted a heavy burden upon the people, whose forced labour was\r\nlargely requisitioned for the building of the new palace. Kotoku,\r\nwhen he promulgated his system of centralized administration,\r\nconceived the idea of a fixed capital and selected Naniwa. But the\r\nEmperor Tenchi moved to Omi, Temmu to Asuka (in Yamato) and the\r\nEmpress Jito to Fujiwara (in Yamato). Mommu remained at the latter\r\nplace until the closing year (707) of his reign, when, finding the\r\nsite inconvenient, he gave orders for the selection of another. But\r\nhis death interrupted the project, and it was not until the second\r\nyear of the Empress Gemmyo's reign that the Court finally removed to\r\nNara, where it remained for seventy-five years, throughout the reigns\r\nof seven sovereigns. Nara, in the province of Yamato, lies nearly due\r\nsouth of Kyoto at a distance of twenty-six miles from the latter.\r\nHistory does not say why it was selected, nor have any details of its\r\nplan been transmitted. To-day it is celebrated for scenic beauties--a\r\nspacious park with noble trees and softly contoured hills, sloping\r\ndown to a fair expanse of lake, and enshrining in their dales ancient\r\ntemples, wherein are preserved many fine specimens of Japanese art,\r\nglyptic and pictorial, of the seventh and eighth centuries. Nothing\r\nremains of the palace where the Court resided throughout a cycle and\r\na half, nearly twelve hundred years ago, but one building, a\r\nstorehouse called Shoso-in, survives in its primitive form and\r\nconstitutes a landmark in the annals of Japanese civilization, for it\r\ncontains specimens of all the articles that were in daily use by the\r\nsovereigns of the Nara epoch.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE COINS\r\n\r\nThere is obscurity about the production of the precious metals in old\r\nJapan. That gold, silver, and copper were known and used is certain,\r\nfor in the dolmens,--which ceased to be built from about the close of\r\nthe sixth century (A.D.)--copper ear-rings plated with gold are\r\nfound, and gold-copper images of Buddha were made in the reign of the\r\nEmpress Suiko (605), while history says that silver was discovered in\r\nthe island of Tsushima in the second year of the Emperor Temmu's\r\nreign (674). From the same island, gold also is recorded to have come\r\nin 701, but in the case of the yellow and the white metal alike, the\r\nsupply obtained was insignificant, and indeed modern historians are\r\ndisposed to doubt whether the alleged Tsushima gold was not in\r\nreality brought from Korea via that island. On the whole, the\r\nevidence tends to show that, during the first seven centuries of the\r\nChristian era, Japan relied on Korea mainly, and on China partially,\r\nfor her supply of the precious metals. Yet neither gold, silver, nor\r\ncopper coins seem to have been in anything like general use until the\r\nWado era (708-715).\r\n\r\nCoined money had already been a feature of Chinese civilization since\r\nthe fourth century before Christ, and when Japan began to take models\r\nfrom her great neighbour during the Sui and Tang dynasties, she\r\ncannot have failed to appreciate the advantages of artificial media\r\nof exchange. The annals allege that in A.D. 677 the first mint was\r\nestablished, and that in 683 an ordinance prescribed that the silver\r\ncoins struck there should be superseded by copper. But this rule did\r\nnot remain long in force, nor have there survived any coins, whether\r\nof silver or of copper, certainly identifiable as antecedent to the\r\nWado era. It was in the year of the Empress Gemmyo's accession (708)\r\nthat deposits of copper were found in the Chichibu district of\r\nMusashi province, and the event seemed sufficiently important to call\r\nfor a change of year-name to Wado (refined copper). Thenceforth,\r\ncoins of copper--or more correctly, bronze--were regularly minted and\r\ngradually took the place of rice or cotton cloth as units of value.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that, from the close of the seventh century, a wave of\r\nmining industry swept over Japan. Silver was procured from the\r\nprovinces of Iyo and Kii; copper from Inaba and Suo, and tin from\r\nIse, Tamba, and Iyo. All this happened between the years 690 and 708,\r\nbut the discovery of copper in the latter year in Chichibu was on\r\ncomparatively the largest scale, and may be said to have given the\r\nfirst really substantial impetus to coining. For some unrecorded\r\nreason silver pieces were struck first and were followed by copper a\r\nfew months later. Both were of precisely the same form--round with a\r\nsquare hole in the middle to facilitate threading on a string--both\r\nwere of the same denomination (one won), and both bore the same\r\nsuperscription (Wado Kaiho, or \"opening treasure of refined copper\"),\r\nthe shape, the denomination, and the legend being taken from a coin\r\nof the Tang dynasty struck eighty-eight years previously. It was\r\nordered that in using these pieces silver should be paid in the case\r\nof sums of or above four mon, and copper in the case of sums of or\r\nbelow three won, the value of the silver coin being four times that\r\nof the copper. But the silver tokens soon ceased to be current and\r\ncopper mainly occupied the field, a position which it held for 250\r\nyears, from 708 to 958. During that interval, twelve forms of sen*\r\nwere struck. They deteriorated steadily in quality, owing to growing\r\nscarcity of the supply of copper; and, partly to compensate for the\r\nincreased cost of the metal, partly to minister to official greed,\r\nthe new issues were declared, on several occasions, to have a value\r\nten times as great as their immediate predecessors. Concerning that\r\nvalue, the annals state that in 711 the purchasing power of the mon\r\n(i.e., of the one-sen token) was sixty go of rice, and as the daily\r\nration for a full-grown man is five go, it follows that one sen\r\noriginally sufficed for twelve days' sustenance.**\r\n\r\n*The ideograph sen signified originally a \"fountain,\" and its\r\nemployment to designate a coin seems to have been suggested by an\r\nidea analogous to that underlying the English word \"currency.\"\r\n\r\n**\"At the present time the wages of a carpenter are almost a yen a\r\nday. Now the yen is equal to 1000 mon of the smaller sen and to 500\r\nmon of the larger ones, so that he could have provided himself with\r\nrice, if we count only 500 mon to the yen, for sixteen years on the\r\nwages which he receives for one day's labour in 1900.\" (Munro's Coins\r\nof Japan.)\r\n\r\nMuch difficulty was experienced in weaning the people from their old\r\ncustom of barter and inducing them to use coins. The Government seems\r\nto have recognized that there could not be any effective spirit of\r\neconomy so long as perishable goods represented the standard of\r\nvalue, and in order to popularize the use of the new tokens as well\r\nas to encourage thrift, it was decreed that grades of rank would be\r\nbestowed upon men who had saved certain sums in coin. At that time\r\n(711), official salaries had already been fixed in terms of the Wado\r\nsen. The highest received thirty pieces of cloth, one hundred hanks\r\nof silk and two thousand mon, while in the case of an eighth-class\r\nofficial the corresponding figures were one piece of cloth and twenty\r\nmon.* The edict for promoting economy embodied a schedule according\r\nto which, broadly speaking, two steps of executive rank could be\r\ngained by amassing twenty thousand mon and one step by saving five\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n*These figures sound ludicrously small if translated into present-day\r\nmoney, for 1000 mon go to the yen, and the latter being the\r\nequivalent of two shillings, 20 mon represents less then a\r\nhalf-penny. But of course the true calculation is that 20 mon\r\nrepresented 240 days' rations of rice in the Wado schedule of values.\r\n\r\nObserving that the fundamental principle of a sound token of exchange\r\nwas wholly disregarded in these Wado sen, since their intrinsic value\r\nbore no appreciable ratio to their purchasing power, and considering\r\nalso the crudeness of their manufacture, it is not surprising to find\r\nthat within a few months of their appearance they were extensively\r\nforged. What is much more notable is that the Wado sen remained in\r\ncirculation for fifty years. The extraordinary ratio, however, by\r\nwhich copper and silver were linked together originally, namely, 4 to\r\n1, did not survive; in 721 it was changed to 25 to 10, and in the\r\nfollowing year to 50 to 10. Altogether, as was not unnatural, the\r\nearly treatment of this coinage question by Japanese statesmen showed\r\nno trace of scientific perception. The practice, pursued almost\r\ninvariably, of multiplying by ten the purchasing power of each new\r\nissue of sen, proved, of course, enormously profitable to the\r\nissuers, but could not fail to distress the people and to render\r\nunpopular such arbitrarily varying tokens.\r\n\r\nThe Government spared no effort to correct the latter result, and\r\nsome of the devices employed were genuinely progressive. In that\r\nepoch travellers had to carry their own provisions, and not\r\nuncommonly the supply ran short before they reached their\r\ndestination, the result sometimes being death from starvation on the\r\nroadside. It was therefore ordered that in every district (korf) a\r\ncertain portion of rice should be stored at a convenient place for\r\nsale to wayfarers, and these were advised to provide themselves with\r\na few sen before setting out. It is evident that, since one of the\r\nWado coins sufficed to buy rice for twelve days' rations, a traveller\r\nwas not obliged to burden himself with many of these tokens. Wealthy\r\npersons in the provinces were also admonished to set up roadside\r\nshops for the sale of rice, and anyone who thus disposed of one\r\nhundred koku in a year was to be reported to the Court for special\r\nreward. Moreover, no district governor (gunryo), however competent,\r\nwas counted eligible for promotion unless he had saved six thousand\r\nsen, and it was enacted that all taxes might be paid in copper coin.\r\nIn spite of all this, however, the use of metallic media was limited\r\nfor a long time to the upper classes and to the inhabitants of the\r\nfive home provinces. Elsewhere the old habit of barter continued.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-FOURTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS GENSHO (A.D. 715-723)\r\n\r\nIn the year 715, the Empress Gemmyo, after a reign of seven years,\r\nabdicated in favour of her daughter, Gensho. This is the only\r\ninstance in Japanese history of an Empress succeeding an Empress.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL COMPILATION\r\n\r\nThe reigns of these two Empresses are memorable for the compilation\r\nof the two oldest Japanese histories which have been handed down to\r\nthe present epoch, the Kojiki and the Nihongi; but as the\r\ncircumstances in which these works, as well as the Fudoki (Records of\r\nNatural Features), were written have been sufficiently described\r\nalready (vide Chapter I), it remains only to refer to a custom\r\ninaugurated by Gemmyo in the year (721) after the compilation of the\r\nNihongi, the custom of summoning to Court learned men (hakase) and\r\nrequiring them to deliver lectures on that work. Subsequent\r\ngenerations of sovereigns followed this example, and to this day one\r\nof the features of the New Year's observances is a historical\r\ndiscourse in the palace. The writing of history became thenceforth an\r\nimperially patronized occupation. Six works, covering the period from\r\n697 to 887, appeared in succession and were known through all ages as\r\nthe Six National Histories. It is noticeable that in the compilation\r\nof all these a leading part was taken by one or another of the great\r\nFujiwara ministers, and that the fifth numbered among its authors the\r\nillustrious Sugawara Michizane.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-FIFTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR SHOMU (A.D. 724-748)\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor Mommu died (707), his son, the Prince Imperial, was\r\ntoo young to succeed. Therefore the sceptre came into the hands of\r\nMommu's mother, who, after a reign of seven years, abdicated in\r\nfavour of her daughter, the Empress Gensho, and, eight years later,\r\nthe latter in turn abdicated in favour of her nephew, Shomu, who had\r\nnow reached man's estate. Shomu's mother, Higami, was a daughter of\r\nFujiwara Fuhito, and as the Fujiwara family did not belong to the\r\nKwobetsu class, she had not attained the rank of Empress, but had\r\nremained simply Mommu's consort (fujiri). Her son, the Emperor Shomu,\r\nmarried another daughter of the same Fujiwara Fuhito by a different\r\nmother; that is to say, he took for consort his own mother's\r\nhalf-sister, Asuka. This lady, Asuka, laboured under the same\r\ndisadvantage of lineage and could not properly be recognized as\r\nEmpress. It is necessary to note these details for they constitute\r\nthe preface to a remarkable page of Japanese history. Of Fujiwara\r\nFuhito's two daughters, one, Higami, was the mother of the reigning\r\nEmperor, Shomu, and the other, Asuka, was his consort. The blood\r\nrelationship of the Fujiwara family to the Court could scarcely have\r\nbeen more marked, but its public recognition was impeded by the\r\ndefect in the family's lineage.\r\n\r\nTHE FUJIWARA CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\nImmediately after Shomu's accession, his mother, Higami, received the\r\ntitle of Kwo-taifujin (Imperial Great Lady). But the ambition of her\r\nfamily was to have her named Kwo-taiko (Empress Dowager). The Emperor\r\nalso desired to raise his consort, Asuka, to the position of Empress.\r\nConsulting his ministers on the subject, he encountered opposition\r\nfrom Prince Nagaya, minister of the Left. This prince, a\r\ngreat-grandson of the Emperor Temmu, enjoyed high reputation as a\r\nscholar, was looked up to as a statesman of great wisdom, and\r\npossessed much influence owing to his exalted official position. He\r\nurged that neither precedent nor law sanctioned nomination of a lady\r\nof the Shimbetsu class to the rank of Empress. The Daiho code was\r\nindeed very explicit on the subject. In China, whither the drafters\r\nof the code went for models, no restrictions were imposed on a\r\nsovereign's choice of wife. But the Japanese legislators clearly\r\nenacted that an Empress must be taken from among Imperial princesses.\r\nPrince Nagaya, in his position as minister of the Left, opposed any\r\ndeparture from that law and thus thwarted the designs of the\r\nFujiwara.\r\n\r\nThe lady Asuka bore a son to the Emperor three years after his\r\naccession. His Majesty was profoundly pleased. He caused a general\r\namnesty to be proclaimed, presented gratuities to officials, and\r\ngranted gifts to all children born on the same day. When only two\r\nmonths old, the child was created Prince Imperial, but in his\r\neleventh month he fell ill. Buddhist images were cast; Buddhist\r\nSutras were copied; offerings were made to the Kami, and an amnesty\r\nwas proclaimed. Nothing availed. The child died, and the Emperor was\r\ndistraught with grief. In this incident the partisans of the Fujiwara\r\nsaw their opportunity. They caused it to be laid to Prince Nagaya's\r\ncharge that he had compassed the death of the infant prince by charms\r\nand incantations. Two of the Fujiwara nobles were appointed to\r\ninvestigate the accusation, and they condemned the prince to die by\r\nhis own hand. He committed suicide, and his wife and children died\r\nwith him. The travesty of justice was carefully acted throughout. A\r\nproclamation was issued promising capital punishment to any one, of\r\nwhatever rank or position, who compassed the death or injury of\r\nanother by spells or incantations, and, six months later, the lady\r\nAsuka was formally proclaimed Empress.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the Fujiwara conspirators showed themselves clumsy.\r\nThe rescript justified Asuka's elevation by reference to the case of\r\nIwa, a daughter of the Takenouchi, whom the Emperor Nintoku had made\r\nhis Empress. But the Takenouchi family belonged to the Kwobetsu\r\nclass, and the publication of a special edict in justification could\r\nbe read as self-condemnation only. Nevertheless, the Fujiwara had\r\ncompassed their purpose. Thenceforth they wielded the power of the\r\nState through the agency of their daughters. They furnished Empresses\r\nand consorts to the reigning sovereigns, and took their own wives\r\nfrom the Minamoto family, itself of Imperial lineage. To such an\r\nextent was the former practice followed that on two occasions three\r\nFujiwara ladies served simultaneously in the palace. This happened\r\nwhen Go-Reizei (1222-1232) had a Fujiwara Empress, Kwanko, and two\r\nFujiwara consorts, Fumi and Hiro. At one moment it had seemed as\r\nthough fate would interfere to thwart these astute plans. An epidemic\r\nof small-pox, originating (735) in Kyushu, spread over the whole\r\ncountry, and carried off the four sons of Fuhito--Muchimaro,\r\nFusazaki, Umakai, and Maro--leaving the family's fortunes in the\r\nhands of juniors, who occupied only minor official positions. But the\r\nFujiwara genius rose superior to all vicissitudes. The elevation of\r\nthe lady Asuka to be Empress Komyo marks an epoch in Japanese\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS WITH CHINA\r\n\r\nIn spite of the length and perils of a voyage from Japan to China in\r\nthe seventh and eighth centuries--one embassy which sailed from\r\nNaniwa in the late summer of 659 did not reach China for 107\r\ndays--the journey was frequently made by Japanese students of\r\nreligion and literature, just as the Chinese, on their side,\r\ntravelled often to India in search of Buddhist enlightenment. This\r\naccess to the refinement and civilization of the Tang Court\r\ncontributed largely to Japan's progress, both material and moral, and\r\nis frankly acknowledged by her historians as a main factor in her\r\nadvance. When Shomu reigned at Nara, the Court in Changan had entered\r\nthe phase of luxury and epicurism which usually preludes the ruin of\r\na State. Famous literati thronged its portals; great poets and\r\npainters enjoyed its patronage, and annalists descanted on its\r\nmagnificence. Some of the works of these famous men were carried to\r\nJapan and remained with her as models and treasures. She herself\r\nshowed that she had competence to win some laurels even amid such a\r\ngalaxy. In the year 716, Nakamaro, a member of the great Abe family,\r\naccompanied the Japanese ambassador to Tang and remained in China\r\nuntil his death in 770. He was known in China as Chao Heng, and the\r\ngreat poet, Li Pai, composed a poem in his memory, while the Tang\r\nsovereign conferred on him the posthumous title of \"viceroy of\r\nLuchou.\" Not less celebrated was Makibi,* who went to China at the\r\nsame time as Nakamaro, and after twenty years' close study of\r\nConfucius, returned in 735, having earned such a reputation for\r\nprofound knowledge of history, the five classics, jurisprudence,\r\nmathematics, philosophy, calendar making, and other sciences that the\r\nChinese parted with him reluctantly. In Japan he was raised to the\r\nhigh rank of asomi, and ultimately became minister of the Right\r\nduring the reign of Shotoku.\r\n\r\n*Generally spoken of as \"Kibi no Mabi,\" and credited by tradition\r\nwith the invention of the katakana syllabary.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents speak eloquently of the respect paid in Japan to\r\nmental attainments and of the enlightened hospitality of China. In\r\nthe realm of Buddhism perhaps even more than in that of secular\r\nscience, this close intercourse made its influence felt. Priests went\r\nfrom Japan to study in China, and priests came from China to preach\r\nin Japan. During the Nara era, three of these men attained to special\r\neminence. They were Doji, Gembo, and Kanshin. Doji was the great\r\npropagandist of the Sanron sect, whose tenets he had studied in China\r\nfor sixteen years (701-717). From plans prepared by him and taken\r\nfrom the monastery of Hsi-ming in China, the temple Daian-ji was\r\nbuilt under the auspices of the Emperor Shomu, and having been richly\r\nendowed, was placed in Doji's charge as lord-abbot. Gembo, during a\r\nsojourn of two years at the Tang Court, studied the tenets of the\r\nHosso sect, which, like the Sanron, constituted one of the five sects\r\noriginally introduced into Japan. Returning in 736, he presented to\r\nthe Emperor Shomu five thousand volumes of the Sutras, together with\r\na number of Buddhist images, and he was appointed abbot of the\r\ncelebrated temple, Kofuku-ji. The third of the above three religious\r\ncelebrities was a Chinese missionary named Kanshin. He went to Japan\r\naccompanied by fourteen priests, three nuns, and twenty-four laymen,\r\nand the mission carried with it many Buddhist relics, images, and\r\nSutras. Summoned to Nara in 754, he was treated with profound\r\nreverence, and on a platform specially erected before the temple\r\nTodai-ji, where stood the colossal image of Buddha--to be presently\r\nspoken of--the sovereign and many illustrious personages performed\r\nthe most solemn rite of Buddhism under the ministration of Kanshin.\r\nHe established a further claim on the gratitude of the Empress by\r\ncuring her of an obstinate malady, and her Majesty would fain have\r\nraised him to the highest rank (dai-sojo) of the Buddhist priesthood.\r\nBut he declined the honour. Subsequently, the former palace of Prince\r\nNittabe was given to him as a residence and he built there the temple\r\nof Shodai-ji, which still exists.\r\n\r\nRELIGION AND POLITICS\r\n\r\nThe great Confucianist, Makibi, and the Buddhist prelate, Gembo, met\r\nwith misfortune and became the victims of an unjust accusation\r\nbecause they attempted to assert the Imperial authority as superior\r\nto the growing influence of the Fujiwara. Makibi held the post of\r\nchamberlain of the Empress' household, and Gembo officiated at the\r\n\"Interior monastery\" (Nai-dojo) where the members of the Imperial\r\nfamily worshipped Buddha. The Emperor's mother, Higami, who on her\r\nson's accession had received the title of \"Imperial Great Lady\" (vide\r\nsup.), fell into a state of melancholia and invited Gembo to\r\nprescribe for her, which he did successfully. Thus, his influence in\r\nthe palace became very great, and was augmented by the piety of the\r\nEmpress, who frequently listened to discourses by the learned\r\nprelate. Makibi naturally worked in union with Gembo in consideration\r\nof their similar antecedents. Fujiwara Hirotsugu was then governor of\r\nYamato. Witnessing this state of affairs with uneasiness, he\r\nimpeached Gembo. But the Emperor credited the priest's assertions,\r\nand removed Hirotsugu to the remote post of Dazai-fu in Chikuzen.\r\nThere he raised the standard of revolt and was with some difficulty\r\ncaptured and executed. The Fujiwara did not tamely endure this check.\r\nThey exerted their influence to procure the removal of Makibi and\r\nGembo from the capital, both being sent to Tsukushi (Kyushu), Makibi\r\nin the capacity of governor, and Gembo to build the temple\r\nKwannon-ji. Gembo died a year later, and it was commonly reported\r\nthat the spirit of Hirotsugu had compassed his destruction, while\r\nmore than one book, professing to be historical, alleged that his\r\nprime offence was immoral relations with the \"Imperial Great Lady,\"\r\nwho was then some sixty years of age! There can be little doubt that\r\nthe two illustrious scholars suffered for their fame rather than for\r\ntheir faults, and that their chief offences were overshadowing renown\r\nand independence of Fujiwara patronage.\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM IN THE NARA EPOCH\r\n\r\nFrom what has been related above of the priests Kanshin and Gembo, it\r\nwill have been observed that the Emperor Shomu was an earnest\r\ndisciple of Buddhism. The heritage of administrative reforms\r\nbequeathed to him by Tenchi and Temmu should have engrossed his\r\nattention, but he subserved everything to religion, and thus the\r\ngreat national work, begun in the Daika era and carried nearly to\r\ncompletion in the Daiho, suffered its first check. Some annalists\r\nhave pleaded in Shomu's behalf that he trusted religious influence to\r\nconsolidate the system introduced by his predecessors. However that\r\nmay be, history records as the most memorable event of his reign his\r\nabdication of the throne in order to enter religion, thus\r\ninaugurating a practice which was followed by several subsequent\r\nsovereigns and which materially helped the Fujiwara family to usurp\r\nthe reality of administrative power. Shomu, on receiving the tonsure,\r\nchanged his name to Shoman, and thenceforth took no part in secular\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIn all this, however, his procedure marked a climax rather than a\r\ndeparture. In fact, never did any foreign creed receive a warmer\r\nwelcome than that accorded to Buddhism by the Japanese after its\r\nfirst struggle for tolerance. Emperor after Emperor worshipped the\r\nBuddha. Even Tenchi, who profoundly admired the Confucian philosophy\r\nand whose experience of the Soga nobles' treason might well have\r\nprejudiced him against the faith they championed; and even Temmu,\r\nwhose ideals took the forms of frugality and militarism, were lavish\r\nin their offerings at Buddhist ceremonials. The Emperor Mommu enacted\r\na law for the better control of priests and nuns, yet he erected the\r\ntemple Kwannon-ji. The great Fujiwara statesmen, as Kamatari, Fuhito,\r\nand the rest, though they belonged to a family (the Nakatomi) closely\r\nassociated with Shinto worship, were reverent followers of the Indian\r\nfaith. Kamatari approved of his eldest son, Joye, entering the\r\npriesthood, and sent him to China to study the Sutras. He also gave\r\nup his residence at Yamashina for conversion into a monastery.\r\nFujiwara Fuhito built the Kofuku-ji, and his son, Muchimaro, when\r\ngovernor of Omi, repaired temples in the provinces, protected their\r\ndomains, and erected the Jingu-ji.\r\n\r\nThat among the occupants of the throne during 165 years, from 593 to\r\n758, no less than seven were females could not but contribute to the\r\nspread of a religion which owed so much to spectacular effect. Every\r\none of these sovereigns lent earnest aid to the propagation of\r\nBuddhism, and the tendency of the age culminated in the fanaticism of\r\nShomu, re-enforced as it was by the devotion of his consort, Komyo.\r\nTradition has woven into a beautiful legend the nation's impression\r\nof this lady's piety. In an access of humility she vowed to wash the\r\nbodies of a thousand beggars. Nine hundred and ninety-nine had been\r\ncompleted when the last presented himself in the form of a loathsome\r\nleper. Without a sign of repugnance the Empress continued her task,\r\nand no sooner was the ablution concluded than the mendicant ascended\r\nheavenwards, a glory of light radiating from his body. It is also\r\ntold of her that, having received in a dream a miniature golden image\r\nof the goddess of Mercy (Kwannon) holding a baby in her arms, she\r\nconceived a daughter who ultimately reigned as the Empress Koken.*\r\n\r\n*The resemblance between the legend and the Buddhist account of the\r\nIncarnation is plain. It has to be remembered that Nestorians had\r\ncarried Christianity to the Tang Court long before the days of Komyo.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of all this zeal for Buddhism, the nation did not\r\nentirely abandon its traditional faith. The original cult had been\r\nancestor worship. Each great family had its uji no Kami, to whom it\r\nmade offerings and presented supplications. These deities were now\r\nsupplemented, not supplanted. They were grafted upon a Buddhist stem,\r\nand shrines of the uji no Kami became uji-tera, or \"uji temples.\"*\r\nThenceforth the temple (tera) took precedence of the shrine\r\n(yashiro). When spoken of together they became ji-sha. This was the\r\nbeginning of Ryobu Shinto, or mixed Shinto, which found full\r\nexpression when Buddhist teachers, obedient to a spirit of toleration\r\nborn of their belief in the doctrines of metempsychosis and universal\r\nperfectibility, asserted the creed that the Shinto Kami were avatars\r\n(incarnations) of the numerous Buddhas.\r\n\r\n*Thus, Kofukuji, built by Kamatari and Fuhito was called O-Nakatomi\r\nno uji-tera; Onjo-ji, erected by Otomo Suguri, was known as Otomo no\r\nuji-tera, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe Nara epoch has not bequeathed to posterity many relics of the\r\ngreat religious edifices that came into existence under Imperial\r\npatronage during its seventy-five years. Built almost wholly of wood,\r\nthese temples were gradually destroyed by fire. One object, however,\r\ndefied the agent of destruction. It is a bronze Buddha of huge\r\nproportions, known now to all the world as the \"Nara Daibutsu.\" On\r\nthe fifteenth day of the tenth month of the fifteenth year of\r\nTembyo--7th of November, 743--the Emperor Shomu proclaimed his\r\nintention of undertaking this work. The rescript making the\r\nannouncement is extant. It sets out by declaring that \"through the\r\ninfluence and authority of Buddha the country enjoys tranquillity,\"\r\nand while warning the provincial and district governors against in\r\nany way constraining the people to take part in the project, it\r\npromises that every contributor shall be welcome, even though he\r\nbring no more than a twig to feed the furnace or a handful of clay\r\nfor the mould. The actual work of casting began in 747 and was\r\ncompleted in three years, after seven failures. The image was not\r\ncast in its entirety; it was built up with bronze plates soldered\r\ntogether. A sitting presentment of the Buddha, it had a height of\r\nfifty-three and a half feet and the face was sixteen feet long, while\r\non either side was an attendant bosatsu standing thirty feet high.\r\nFor the image, 986,030,000 lbs. of copper were needed, and on the\r\ngilding of its surface 870 lbs. of refined gold were used.\r\n\r\nThese figures represented a vast fortune in the eighth century.\r\nIndeed it seemed likely that a sufficiency of gold would not be\r\nprocurable, but fortunately in the year 749 the yellow metal was\r\nfound in the province of Mutsu, and people regarded the timely\r\ndiscovery as a special dispensation of Buddha. The great hall in\r\nwhich the image stood had a height of 120 feet and a width of 290\r\nfeet from east to west, and beside it two pagodas rose to a height of\r\n230 feet each. Throughout the ten years occupied in the task of\r\ncollecting materials and casting this Daibutsu, the Emperor solemnly\r\nworshipped Rushana Buddha three times daily, and on its completion he\r\ntook the tonsure. It was not until the year 752, however, that the\r\nfinal ceremony of unveiling took place technically called \"opening\r\nthe eyes\" (kaigan). On that occasion the Empress Koken, attended by\r\nall the great civil and military dignitaries, held a magnificent\r\nfete, and in the following year the temple--Todai-ji--was endowed\r\nwith the taxes of five thousand households and the revenue from\r\ntwenty-five thousand acres of rice-fields.\r\n\r\nPROVINCIAL TEMPLES\r\n\r\nWhile all this religious fervour was finding costly expression among\r\nthe aristocrats in Nara, the propagandists and patrons of Buddhism\r\ndid not neglect the masses. In the year 741, provincial temples were\r\nofficially declared essential to the State's well-being. These\r\nedifices had their origin at an earlier date. During the reign of\r\nTemmu (673-686) an Imperial rescript ordered that throughout the\r\nwhole country every household should provide itself with a Buddhist\r\nshrine and place therein a sacred image. When the pious Empress Jito\r\noccupied the throne (690-696), the first proselytizing mission was\r\ndespatched to the Ezo, among whom many converts were won; and, later\r\nin the same reign, another rescript directed that a certain\r\nSutra--the Konkwo myo-kyo, or Sutra of Golden Effulgence--should be\r\nread during the first month of every year in each province, the fees\r\nof the officiating priests and other expenses being defrayed out of\r\nthe local official exchequers.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PAGODA OF YAKUSHI-JI, NARA\r\n\r\nDuring Mommu's time (697-707), Buddhist hierarchs (kokushi) were\r\nappointed to the provinces. Their chief functions were to expound the\r\nSutra and to offer prayers. The devout Shomu not only distributed\r\nnumerous copies of the Sutras, but also carried his zeal to the\r\nlength of commanding that every province should erect a sixteen-foot\r\nimage of Shaka with attendant bosatsu (Bodhisattva), and, a few years\r\nlater, he issued another command that each province must provide\r\nitself with a pagoda seven storeys high. By this last rescript the\r\nprovincial temples (kokubun-ji) were called into official existence,\r\nand presently their number was increased to two in each province, one\r\nfor priests and one for nuns. The kokushi attached to these temples\r\nlaboured in the cause of propagandism and religious education side by\r\nside with the provincial pundits (kunihakase), whose duty was to\r\ninstruct the people in law and literature; but it is on record that\r\nthe results of the former's labours were much more conspicuous than\r\nthose of the latter.\r\n\r\nGYOGI\r\n\r\nIt is said to have been mainly at the instance of the Empress Komyo\r\nthat the great image of Todai-ji was constructed and the provincial\r\ntemples were established. But undoubtedly the original impulse came\r\nfrom a priest, Gyogi. He was one of those men who seem to have been\r\nspecially designed by fate for the work they undertake. Gyogi, said\r\nto have been of Korean extraction, had no learning like that which\r\nwon respect for Kanshin and Gembo. But he was amply gifted with the\r\npersonal magnetism which has always distinguished notably successful\r\npropagandists of religion. Wherever he preached and prayed, thousands\r\nof priests and laymen flocked to hear him, and so supreme was his\r\ninfluence that under his direction the people gladly undertook\r\nextensive works of bridge building and road making. Like Shotoku\r\nTaishi, his name is associated by tradition with achievements not\r\nproperly assignable to him, as the invention of the potter's\r\nwheel--though it had been in use for centuries before his time--and\r\nthe production of various works of art which can scarcely have\r\noccupied the attention of a religious zealot. By order of the Empress\r\nGensho, Gyogi was thrown into prison for a time, such a disturbing\r\neffect did his propagandism produce on men's pursuit of ordinary\r\nbread winning; but he soon emerged from durance and was taken into\r\nreverent favour by the Emperor Shomu, who attached four hundred\r\npriests as his disciples and conferred on him the titles of Dai-Sojo\r\n(Great Hierarch) and Dai-Bosatsu (Great Bodhisattva).\r\n\r\nThe enigma of the people's patience under the stupendous burdens\r\nimposed on them by the fanatic piety of Shomu and his consort, Komyo,\r\nfinds a solution in the co-operation of Gyogi, whose speech and\r\npresence exercised more influence than a hundred Imperial edicts. It\r\nis recorded that, by way of corollary to the task of reconciling the\r\nnation to the Nara Court's pious extravagance, Gyogi compassed the\r\nerection of no less than forty-nine temples. But perhaps the most\r\nmemorable event in his career was the part he took in reconciling the\r\nindigenous faith and the imported. However fervent Shomu's belief in\r\nBuddhism, the country he ruled was the country of the Kami, and on\r\ndescent from the Kami his own title to the throne rested. Thus,\r\nqualms of conscience may well have visited him when he remembered the\r\ncomparatively neglected shrine of the Sun goddess at Ise. Gyogi\r\nundertook to consult the will of the goddess, and carried back a\r\nrevelation which he interpreted in the sense that Amaterasu should be\r\nregarded as an incarnation of the Buddha. The Emperor then despatched\r\nto Ise a minister of State who obtained an oracle capable of similar\r\ninterpretation, and, on the night after receipt of this utterance,\r\nthe goddess, appearing to his Majesty in a vision, told him that the\r\nsun was Birushana (Vairotchana Tathagata); or Dainishi (Great Sun)\r\nNyorai.\r\n\r\nThus was originated a theory which enabled Buddhism and Shinto to\r\nwalk hand in hand for a thousand years, the theory that the Shinto\r\nKami are avatars of the Buddha. Some historians contend that this\r\nidea must have been evolved and accepted before the maturity of the\r\nproject for casting the colossal image at Nara, and that the credit\r\nprobably belongs to Gembo; others attribute it to the immortal priest\r\nKukai (Kobo Daishi), who is said to have elaborated the doctrine in\r\nthe early years of the ninth century. Both seem wrong.\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITIONS\r\n\r\nSide by side with the vigorous Buddhism of the Nara epoch, strange\r\nsuperstitions obtained currency and credence. Two may be mentioned as\r\nillustrating the mood of the age. One related to an ascetic, En no\r\nUbasoku, who was worshipped by the people of Kinai under the name of\r\nEn no Gyoja (En the anchorite). He lived in a cave on Katsuragi Mount\r\nfor forty years, wore garments made of wistaria bark, and ate only\r\npine leaves steeped in spring water. During the night he compelled\r\ndemons to draw water and gather firewood, and during the day he rode\r\nupon clouds of five colours. The Kami Hitokotonushi, having been\r\nthreatened by him for neglecting his orders, inspired a man to accuse\r\nhim of treasonable designs, and the Emperor Mommu sent soldiers to\r\narrest him. But as he was able to evade them by recourse to his art\r\nof flying, they apprehended his mother in his stead, whereupon he at\r\nonce gave himself up. In consideration of his filial piety his\r\npunishment was commuted to exile on an island off the Izu coast, and\r\nin deference to the Imperial orders he remained there quietly\r\nthroughout the day, but devoted the night to flying to the summit of\r\nMount Fuji or gliding over the sea. This En no Gyoja was the founder\r\nof a sect of priests calling themselves Yamabushi.\r\n\r\nThe second superstition relates to one of the genii named Kume. By\r\nthe practice of asceticism he obtained supernatural power, and while\r\nriding one day upon a cloud, he passed above a beautiful girl washing\r\nclothes in a river, and became so enamoured of her that he lost his\r\nsuperhuman capacities and fell at her feet. She became his wife.\r\nYears afterwards it chanced that he was called out for forced labour,\r\nand, being taunted by the officials as a pseudo-genius, he fasted and\r\nprayed for seven days and seven nights. On the eighth morning a\r\nthunder-storm visited the scene, and after it, a quantity of heavy\r\ntimber was found to have been moved, without any human effort, from\r\nthe forest to the site of the projected building. The Emperor,\r\nhearing of this, granted him forty-five acres, on which he built the\r\ntemple of Kume-dera.\r\n\r\nSuch tales found credence in the Nara epoch, and indeed all through\r\nthe annals of early Japan there runs a well-marked thread of\r\nsuperstition which owed something of its obtrusiveness to intercourse\r\nwith Korea and China, whence came professors of the arts of\r\ninvisibility and magic. A thunder deity making his occasional abode\r\nin lofty trees is gravely spoken of in the context of a campaign, and\r\nif at one moment a river is inhabited by a semi-human monster, at\r\nanother a fish formed like a child is caught in the sea. There is, of\r\ncourse, an herb of longevity--\"a plant resembling coral in shape,\r\nwith clustering leaves and branches; some red, others purple, others\r\nblack, others golden coloured, and some changing their colours in the\r\nfour seasons.\" In the reign of the Empress Kogyoku, witches and\r\nwizards betray the people into all sorts of extravagances; and a\r\nKorean acolyte has for friend a tiger which teaches him all manner of\r\nwonderful arts, among others that of healing any disease with a magic\r\nneedle. Later on, these and cognate creations of credulity take their\r\nappropriate places in the realm of folk-lore, but they rank with\r\nsober history in the ancient annals. In this respect Japan did not\r\ndiffer from other early peoples.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-SIXTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS KOKEN (A.D. 749-758)\r\n\r\nIn July, 749, the Emperor Shomu abdicated in favour of his daughter,\r\nPrincess Abe, known in history as Koken. Her mother was the\r\ncelebrated Princess Asuka, who, in spite of the Shimbetsu lineage of\r\nher Fujiwara family, had been made Shomu's Empress, and whose name\r\nhad been changed to Komyo (Refulgence) in token of her illustrious\r\npiety. The daughter inherited all the mother's romance, but in her\r\ncase it often degenerated into a passion more elementary than\r\nreligious ecstasy. Shomu, having no son, made his daughter heir to\r\nthe throne. Japanese history furnished no precedent for such a step.\r\nThe custom had always been that a reign ceased on the death of a\r\nsovereign unless the Crown Prince had not yet reached maturity, in\r\nwhich event his mother, or some other nearly related princess,\r\noccupied the throne until he came of age and then surrendered the\r\nreigns of government to his hands. Such had been the practice in the\r\ncase of the Empresses Jito, Gemmyo, and Gensho. Shomu, however, not\r\nonly bequeathed the throne to a princess, but while himself still in\r\nthe prime of life, abdicated in her favour.\r\n\r\nThereafter, at the recognized instance of the all-powerful Fujiwara\r\nfamily, Emperors often surrendered the sceptre to their heirs,\r\nthemselves retiring into religious life with the secular title of\r\nDa-joko (Great ex-Emperor) and the ecclesiastical designation of Ho-o\r\n(pontiff). Shomu was the originator of this practice, but the annals\r\nare silent as to the motive that inspired him. It will be presently\r\nseen that under the skilful manipulation of the Fujiwara nobles, this\r\ndevice of abdication became a potent aid to their usurpation of\r\nadministrative power, and from that point of view the obvious\r\ninference is that Shomu's unprecedented step was taken at their\r\nsuggestion. But the Buddhist propagandists, also, were profoundly\r\ninterested. That the sovereign himself should take the tonsure could\r\nnot fail to confer marked prestige on the Church. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that Shomu was swayed by both influences--that of the\r\nBuddhists, who worked frankly in the cause of their creed, and that\r\nof the Fujiwara, who desired to see a lady of their own lineage upon\r\nthe throne.\r\n\r\nKOKEN AND NAKAMARO\r\n\r\nThe fanaticism of the Emperor Shomu and his consort, Komyo, bore\r\nfruit during the reign of Koken. In the third year after Shomu's\r\nabdication, a decree was issued prohibiting the taking of life in any\r\nform. This imposed upon the State the responsibility of making\r\ndonations of rice to support the fishermen, whose source of\r\nlivelihood was cut off by the decree. Further, at the ceremony of\r\nopening the public worship of the great image of Buddha, the Empress\r\nin person led the vast procession of military, civil, and religious\r\ndignitaries to the temple Todai-ji. It was a fete of unparalleled\r\ndimensions. All officials of the fifth grade and upwards wore full\r\nuniform, and all of lesser grades wore robes of the colour\r\nappropriate to their rank. Ten thousand Buddhist priests officiated,\r\nand the Imperial musicians were re-enforced by those from all the\r\ntemples throughout the home provinces. Buddhism in Japan had never\r\npreviously received such splendid homage.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the Empress visited the residence of the grand\r\ncouncillor, Fujiwara no Nakamaro. Fourteen hundred years had elapsed,\r\naccording to Japanese history, since the first of the Yamato\r\nsovereigns set up his Court, and never had the Imperial house\r\nincurred such disgrace as now befell it. Fujiwara no Nakamaro was a\r\ngrandson of the great Kamatari. He held the rank of dainagon and was\r\nat once a learned man and an able administrator. From the time of\r\nthat visit to the Tamura-no-tei (Tamura mansion), as his residence\r\nwas called, the Empress repaired thither frequently, and finally made\r\nit a detached palace under the name of Tamura-no-miya. Those that\r\ntried to put an end to the liaison were themselves driven from\r\noffice, and Nakamaro's influence became daily stronger.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-SEVENTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR JUNNIN (758-764 A.D.)\r\n\r\nIn August, 758, the Empress, after a reign of four years, nominally\r\nabdicated in favour of the Crown Prince, Junnin, but continued to\r\ndischarge all the functions of government herself. Her infatuation\r\nfor Nakamaro seemed to increase daily. She bestowed on him titles of\r\nadmiration and endearment under the guise of homonymous ideographs,\r\nand she also bestowed on him in perpetuity the revenue from 3000\r\nhouseholds and 250 acres of land. But Koken's caprice took a new\r\nturn. She became a nun and transferred her affection to a priest,\r\nYuge no Dokyo. Nakamaro did not tamely endure to be thus discarded.\r\nHe raised the standard of revolt and found that the nun could be as\r\nrelentless as the Empress had been gracious. The rebellion--known by\r\nirony of fate as that of Oshikatsu (the Conqueror), which was one of\r\nthe names bestowed on him by Koken in the season of her\r\nfavour--proved a brief struggle. Nakamaro fell in battle and his\r\nhead, together with those of his wife, his children, and his devoted\r\nfollowers to the number of thirty-four, was despatched to Nara. The\r\ntumult had a more serious sequel. It was mainly through Nakamaro's\r\ninfluence that Junnin had been crowned six years previously, and his\r\nMajesty naturally made no secret of his aversion for the new\r\nfavourite. The Dowager Empress--so Koken had called herself--did not\r\nhesitate a moment. In the very month following Nakamaro's\r\ndestruction, she charged that the Emperor was in collusion with the\r\nrebel; despatched a force of troops to surround the palace; dethroned\r\nJunnin; degraded him to the rank of a prince, and sent him and his\r\nmother into exile, where the conditions of confinement were made so\r\nintolerable that the ex-Emperor attempted to escape, was captured and\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THE KASUGA JINJA SHRINE AT KARA\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-EIGHTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS SHOTOKU (765-770 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe nun Koken now abandoned the veil and re-ascended the throne under\r\nthe name of Shotoku. Her affection for Dokyo had been augmented by\r\nhis constant ministrations during her illness while on a visit to the\r\n\"detatched palace\" at Omi, and she conferred on him a priestly title\r\nwhich made him rank equally with the prime minister. All the civil\r\nand military magnates had to pay homage to him at the festival of the\r\nNew Year in his exalted capacity. Yet her Majesty was not satisfied.\r\nAnother step of promotion was possible. In the year after her second\r\nascent of the throne she named him Ho-o (pontiff), a title never\r\npreviously borne by any save her father, the ex-Emperor Shomu. Dokyo\r\nrose fully to the level of the occasion. He modelled his life in\r\nevery respect on that of a sovereign and assumed complete control of\r\nthe administration of the empire. He not only fared sumptuously but\r\nalso built many temples, and as the Empress was not less extravagant,\r\nthe burden of taxation became painfully heavy. But the priestly\r\nfavourite, who seems to have now conceived the ambition of ascending\r\nthe throne, abated nothing of his pomp. Whether at his instigation or\r\nbecause his favour had become of paramount importance to all men of\r\nambition, Asomaro, governor of the Dazai-fu, informed the Empress\r\nthat, according to an oracle delivered by the god of War (Hachiman)\r\nat Usa, the nation would enjoy tranquillity and prosperity if Dokyo\r\nwere its ruler.\r\n\r\nThe Empress had profound reverence for Hachiman, as, indeed, was well\r\nknown to Asomaro and to Dokyo. Yet she hesitated to take this extreme\r\nstep without fuller assurance. She ordered Wake no Kiyomaro to\r\nproceed to Usa and consult the deity once more. Kiyomaro was a\r\nfearless patriot. That Shotoku's choice fell on him at this juncture\r\nmight well have been regarded by his countrymen as an intervention of\r\nheaven. Before setting out he had unequivocal evidence of what was to\r\nbe expected at Dokyo's hands by the bearer of a favourable revelation\r\nfrom Hachiman. Yet the answer carried back by him from the Usa shrine\r\nwas explicitly fatal to Dokyo's hope. \"Since the establishment of the\r\nState the distinction of sovereign and subject has been observed.\r\nThere is no instance of a subject becoming sovereign. The successor\r\nof the throne must be of the Imperial family and a usurper is to be\r\nrejected.\" Dokyo's wrath was extreme. He ordered that Kiyomaro's name\r\nshould be changed to Kegaremaro, which was equivalent to substituting\r\n\"foul\" for \"fair;\" he banished him to Osumi in the extreme south of\r\nKyushu, and he sent emissaries whose attempt to assassinate him was\r\nbalked by a thunder-storm. But before he could bring any fresh design\r\nto maturity, the Empress died. Dokyo and Asomaro were banished, and\r\nKiyomaro was recalled from exile.\r\n\r\nHistorians have been much perplexed to account for the strangely\r\napathetic demeanour of the high dignitaries of State in the presence\r\nof such disgraceful doings as those of the Empress and her favourite.\r\nThey specially blame Kibi no Makibi, the great scholar. He had\r\nrecovered from his temporary eclipse in connexion with the revolt of\r\nFujiwara Hirotsugu, and he held the office of minister of the Right\r\nduring a great part of Koken's reign. Yet it is not on record that he\r\noffered any remonstrance. The same criticism, however, seems to apply\r\nwith not less justice to his immediate predecessors in the post of\r\nministers of the Right, Tachibana no Moroe and Fujiwara no Toyonari;\r\nto the minister of the Left, Fujiwara no Nagate; to the second\r\ncouncillor, Fujiwara no Matate, and to the privy councillors,\r\nFujiwara no Yoshitsugu, Fujiwara no Momokawa, and Fujiwara no Uwona.\r\nIt was with the Fujiwara families that the responsibility rested\r\nchiefly, and the general conduct of the Fujiwara at that period of\r\nhistory forbids us to construe their apparent indifference in a\r\nwholly bad sense. Probably the simplest explanation is the true one:\r\nKoken herself was a Fujiwara.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\nIn the days of Shomu and Koken administrative abuses were not limited\r\nto the capital, they extended to the provinces also. Among the Daika\r\nand Daiho laws, the first that proved to be a failure was that\r\nrelating to provincial governors. At the outset men of ability were\r\nchosen for these important posts, and their term of service was\r\nlimited to four years. Soon, however, they began to petition for\r\nreappointment, and under the sway of the Empress Koken a via media\r\nwas found by extending the period of office to six years. Moreover,\r\nwhereas at first a newly appointed governor was supposed to live in\r\nthe official residence of his predecessor, it quickly became the\r\ncustom to build a new mansion for the incoming dignitary and leave\r\nthe outgoing undisturbed.\r\n\r\nWhat that involved is plain when we observe that such edifices were\r\nall constructed by forced labour. These governors usually possessed\r\nlarge domains, acquired during their period of office. The Court\r\nendeavoured to check them by despatching inspectors (ansatsu-shi) to\r\nexamine and report on current conditions; but that device availed\r\nlittle. Moreover, the provincial governors exercised the power of\r\nappointing and dismissing the district governors (gunshi) in their\r\nprovinces, although this evil system had been prohibited in the time\r\nof Gemmyo. In connexion, too, with the rice collected for public\r\npurposes, there were abuses. This rice, so long as it lay in the\r\nofficial storehouses, represented so much idle capital. The\r\nprovincial governors utilized it by lending the grain to the farmers\r\nin the spring, partly for seed purposes and partly for food, on\r\ncondition that it should be paid back in the autumn with fifty per\r\ncent, increment. Subsequently this exorbitant figure was reduced to\r\nthirty per cent. But the result was ruin for many farmers. They had\r\nto hand over their fields and houses or sell themselves into bondage.\r\n\r\nThus, outlaws, living by plunder, became a common feature of the\r\ntime, and there arose a need for guards more capable than those\r\nsupplied by the system of partial conscription. Hence, in the reign\r\nof Shomu, the sons and brothers of district governors (gunshi)\r\nproficient in archery and equestrianism were summoned from Omi, Ise,\r\nMino, and Echizen, and to them was assigned the duty of guarding the\r\npublic storehouses in the provinces. At the same time many men of\r\nprominence and influence began to organize guards for their private\r\nprotection. This was contrary to law, but the condition of the time\r\nseemed to warrant it, and the authorities were powerless to prevent\r\nit. The ultimate supremacy of the military class had its origin in\r\nthese circumstances. The Government itself was constrained to\r\norganize special corps for dealing with the brigands and pirates who\r\ninfested the country and the coasts.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said by a Japanese historian that the fortunes of\r\nthe Yamato were at their zenith during the reigns of the three\r\nEmperors Jimmu, Temmu, and Mommu. From the beginning of the eighth\r\ncentury they began to decline. For that decline, Buddhism was largely\r\nresponsible. Buddhism gave to Japan a noble creed in the place of a\r\ncolourless cult; gave to her art and refinement, but gave to her also\r\nsomething like financial ruin. The Indian faith spread with wonderful\r\nrapidity among all classes and betrayed them into fanatical\r\nextravagance. Anyone who did not erect or contribute largely to the\r\nerection of a temple or a pagoda was not admitted to the ranks of\r\nhumanity. Men readily sacrificed their estates to form temple domains\r\nor to purchase serfs (tera-yakko) to till them. The sublimity of\r\nthese edifices; the solemn grandeur of the images enshrined there;\r\nthe dazzling and exquisite art lavished on their decoration; the\r\nstrange splendour of the whole display might well suggest to the\r\nJapanese the work of some supernatural agencies.\r\n\r\nIn the Nara epoch, the Government spent fully one-half of its total\r\nincome on works of piety. No country except in time of war ever\r\ndevoted so much to unproductive expenditures. The enormous quantities\r\nof copper used for casting images not only exhausted the produce of\r\nthe mines but also made large inroads upon the currency, hundreds of\r\nthousands of cash being thrown into the melting-pot. In 760 it was\r\nfound that the volume of privately coined cash exceeded one-half of\r\nthe State income, and under pretext that to suspend the circulation\r\nof such a quantity would embarrass the people, the Government struck\r\na new coin--the mannen tsuho--which, while not differing appreciably\r\nfrom the old cash in intrinsic value, was arbitrarily invested with\r\nten times the latter's purchasing power. The profit to the treasury\r\nwas enormous; the disturbance of values and the dislocation of trade\r\nwere proportionately great. Twelve years later (772), another\r\nrescript ordered that the new coin should circulate at par with the\r\nold. Such unstable legislation implies a very crude conception of\r\nfinancial requirements.\r\n\r\nRECLAIMED UPLANDS\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the Daika reforms regarded all \"wet fields\" as\r\nthe property of the Crown, while imposing no restriction on the\r\nownership of uplands, these being counted as belonging to their\r\nreclaimers. Thus, large estates began to fall into private\r\npossession; conspicuously in the case of provincial and district\r\ngovernors, who were in a position to employ forced labour, and who\r\nfrequently abused their powers in defiance of the Daika code and\r\ndecrees, where it was enacted that all profits from reclaimed lands\r\nmust be shared with the farmers.* So flagrant did these practices\r\nbecome that, in 767, reclamation was declared to constitute\r\nthereafter no title of ownership. Apparently, however, this veto\r\nproved unpractical, for five years later (772), it was rescinded, the\r\nonly condition now attached being that the farmers must not be\r\ndistressed. Yet again, in 784, another change of policy has to be\r\nrecorded. A decree declared that governors must confine their\r\nagricultural enterprise to public lands, on penalty of being punished\r\ncriminally. If the language of this decree be read literally, a very\r\nevil state of affairs would seem to have existed, for the governors\r\nare denounced as wholly indifferent to public rights or interests,\r\nand as neglecting no means of exploiting the farmers. Finally, in\r\n806, the pursuit of productive enterprise by governors in the\r\nprovinces was once more sanctioned.\r\n\r\n*The term \"farmers,\" as used in the times now under consideration,\r\nmust not be interpreted strictly in the modern sense of the word. It\r\nmeant, rather, the untitled and the unofficial classes in the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nThus, between 650 and 806, no less than five radical changes of\r\npolicy are recorded. It resulted that this vascillating legislation\r\nreceived very little practical attention. Great landed estates\r\n(shoen) accumulated in private hands throughout the empire, some\r\nowned by nobles, some by temples; and in order to protect their\r\ntitles against the interference of the Central Government, the\r\nholders of these estates formed alliances with the great Court nobles\r\nin the capital, so that, in the course of time, a large part of the\r\nland throughout the provinces fell under the control of a few\r\ndominant families.\r\n\r\nIn the capital (Nara), on the other hand, the enormous sums\r\nsquandered upon the building of temples, the casting or carving of\r\nimages, and the performance of costly religious ceremonials gradually\r\nproduced such a state of impecuniosity that, in 775, a decree was\r\nissued ordering that twenty-five per cent, of the revenues of the\r\npublic lands (kugaideri) should be appropriated to increase the\r\nemoluments of the metropolitan officials. This decree spoke of the\r\nlatter officials as not having sufficient to stave off cold or\r\nhunger, whereas their provincial confreres were living in opulence,\r\nand added that even men of high rank were not ashamed to apply for\r\nremoval to provincial posts. As illustrating the straits to which the\r\nmetropolitans were reduced and the price they had to pay for relief,\r\nit is instructive to examine a note found among the contents of the\r\nShoso-in at Nara.\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT OF MON (COPPER CASH) LENT\r\n\r\n           Total, 1700 Mon.

The price of accommodation being so onerous, it\r\nis not difficult to infer the costliness of the necessaries of life.\r\nWhen the Daika reforms were undertaken, the metropolitan magnates\r\nlooked down upon their provincial brethren as an inferior order of\r\nbeings, but in the closing days of the Nara epoch the situations were\r\nreversed, and the ultimate transfer of administrative power from the\r\nCourt to the provincials began to be foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nTHE FUJIWARA FAMILY\r\n\r\nThe religious fanaticism of the Emperor Shomu and his consort, Komyo,\r\nbrought disorder into the affairs of the Imperial Court, and gave\r\nrise to an abuse not previously recorded, namely, favouritism with\r\nits natural outcome, treasonable ambition. It began to be doubtful\r\nwhether the personal administration of the sovereign might not be\r\nproductive of danger to the State. Thus, patriotic politicians\r\nconceived a desire not to transfer the sceptre to outside hands but\r\nto find among the scions of the Imperial family some one competent to\r\nsave the situation, even though the selection involved violation of\r\nthe principle of primogeniture. The death of the Empress Shotoku\r\nwithout issue and the consequent extinction of the Emperor Temmu's\r\nline furnished an opportunity to these loyal statesmen, and they\r\navailed themselves of it to set Konin upon the throne, as will be\r\npresently described.\r\n\r\nIn this crisis of the empire's fortunes, the Fujiwara family acted a\r\nleading part. Fuhito, son of the illustrious Kamatari, having\r\nassisted in the compilation of the Daika code and laws, and having\r\nserved throughout four reigns--Jito, Mommu, Gemmyo, and Gensho--died\r\nat sixty-two in the post of minister of the Right, and left four\r\nsons, Muchimaro, Fusazaki, Umakai, and Maro. These, establishing\r\nthemselves independently, founded the \"four houses\" of the Fujiwara.\r\nMuchimaro's home, being in the south (nan) of the capital, was called\r\nNan-ke; Fusazaki's, being in the north (hoku), was termed Hoku-ke;\r\nUmakai's was spoken of as Shiki-ke, since he presided over the\r\nDepartment of Ceremonies (Shiki), and Maro's went by the name of\r\nKyo-ke, this term also having reference to his office. The\r\ndescendants of the four houses are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                       /\r\n          /            | Toyonari--Tsugunawa\r\n          | Muchimaro <  Nakamaro (Emi no Oshikatsu)\r\n          | (Nan-ke)   | Otomaro--Korekimi\r\n          |            \\\r\n          |\r\n          |            /                              /\r\n          |            | Nagate                       | Nagayoshi (Mototsune)\r\n          | Fusazaki  <  Matate--Uchimaro--Fuyutsugu <      adopted\r\n          | (Hoku-ke)  | Kiyokawa                     | Yoshifusa--Mototsune-+\r\n          |            \\                              \\                      |\r\n          |                                                                  |\r\n          |            /                                                     |\r\n          |            | Hirotsugu                                           |\r\n          | Umakai    <  Yoshitsugu--Tanetsugu-- / Nakanari                  |\r\n          | (Shiki-ke) | --Kiyonari              \\ Kusuko                    |\r\n          |            | Momokawa--Otsugu                                    |\r\nKamatari- |            \\                                                     |\r\nFuhito   <                                                                   |\r\n          |            +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n          | Maro       |\r\n          | (Kyo-ke)   | Tokihira                /\r\n          | Miyako     | Nakahira  /             | Koretada\r\n          | (Consort   |           | Saneyori    | Kanemichi\r\n          | of Mommu)  | Tadahira <  Morosuke-- <  Kaneiye ----+\r\n          |            |           | Morotada    | Tamemitsu   |\r\n          |            \\           \\             | Kinsuye     |\r\n          |                                      \\             |\r\n          | Asuka                                              |\r\n          | (Empress                                           |\r\n          | of Shomu)                                          |\r\n          \\                                                    |\r\n                                                               |\r\n          +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n          |\r\n          |            / Korechika\r\n          | Michitaka <\r\n          |            \\ Takaiye\r\n          | Michikane\r\n          |            / Yorimichi--Morozane--Moromichi -------+\r\n          | Michinaga <                                        |\r\n          \\            \\ Norimichi                             |\r\n                                                               |\r\n                                                               |\r\n          +----------------------------------------------------+\r\n          |\r\n          |            / Tadamichi\r\n          | Tadazane  <\r\n          |            \\ Yorinaga\r\n          \\\r\n\r\nIt has already been related how the four heads of these families all\r\ndied in one year (736) during an epidemic of small-pox, but it may be\r\ndoubted whether this apparent calamity did not ultimately prove\r\nfortunate, for had these men lived, they would have occupied\r\ncommanding positions during the scandalous reign of the Empress Koken\r\n(afterwards Shotoku), and might have supported the ruinous disloyalty\r\nof Nakamaro or the impetuous patriotism of Hirotsugu. However that\r\nmay be, the Fujiwara subsequently took the lead in contriving the\r\nselection and enthronement of a monarch competent to stem the evil\r\ntendency of the time, and when the story of the Fujiwara usurpations\r\ncomes to be written, we should always remember that it had a long\r\npreface of loyal service, a preface extending to four generations.\r\n\r\nTHE FORTY-NINTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KONIN (A.D. 770-781)\r\n\r\nWhen the Empress Shotoku died, no successor had been designated, and\r\nit seemed not unlikely that the country would be thrown into a state\r\nof civil war. The ablest among the princes of the blood was\r\nShirakabe, grandson of the Emperor Tenchi. He was in his sixty-second\r\nyear, had held the post of nagon, and unquestionably possessed\r\nerudition and administrative competence. Fujiwara Momokawa warmly\r\nespoused his cause, but for unrecorded reason Kibi no Makibi offered\r\nopposition. Makibi being then minister of the Right and Momokawa only\r\na councillor, the former's views must have prevailed had not Momokawa\r\nenlisted the aid of his brother, Yoshitsugu, and of his cousin,\r\nFujiwara Nagate, minister of the Left. By their united efforts Prince\r\nShirakabe was proclaimed and became the Emperor Konin, his youngest\r\nson, Osabe, being appointed Prince Imperial.\r\n\r\nKonin justified the zeal of his supporters, but his benevolent and\r\nupright reign has been sullied by historical romanticists, who\r\nrepresent him as party to an unnatural intrigue based on the alleged\r\nlicentiousness and shamelessness of his consort, Princess Inokami, a\r\nlady then in her fifty-sixth year with a hitherto blameless record.\r\nMuch space has been given to this strange tale by certain annalists,\r\nbut its only apparent basis of fact would seem to be that Momokawa,\r\nwishing to secure the succession to Prince Yamabe--afterwards Emperor\r\nKwammu--compassed the deaths of the Empress Inokami and her son,\r\nOsabe, the heir apparent. They were probably poisoned on the same\r\nday, and stories injurious to the lady's reputation--stories going so\r\nfar as to accuse her of attempting the life of the Emperor by\r\nincantation--were circulated in justification of the murder. Certain\r\nit is, however, that to Momokawa's exertions the Emperor Kwammu owed\r\nhis accession, as had his father, Konin. Kwammu, known in his days of\r\npriesthood as Yamabe, was Konin's eldest son, and would have been\r\nnamed Prince Imperial on his father's ascent of the throne had not\r\nhis mother, Takano, been deficient in qualifications of lineage. He\r\nhad held the posts of president of the University and minister of the\r\nCentral Department, and his career, alike in office and on the\r\nthrone, bore witness to the wisdom of his supporters.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the religious faith of the age, it is noteworthy that\r\nMomokawa, by way of promoting Prince Yamabe's interests, caused a\r\nstatue to be made in his likeness, and, enshrining it in the temple\r\nBonshaku-ji, ordered the priests to offer supplications in its\r\nbehalf. The chronicle further relates that after the deaths of the\r\nEmpress (Inokami) and her son (Osabe), Momokawa and Emperor Konin\r\nwere much troubled by the spirits of the deceased. That kind of\r\nbelief in the maleficent as well as in the beneficent powers of the\r\ndead became very prevalent in later times. Momokawa died before the\r\naccession of Kwammu, but to him was largely due the great influence\r\nsubsequently wielded by the Fujiwara at Court. It is on record that\r\nKwammu, speaking in after years to Momokawa's son, Otsugu, recalled\r\nhis father's memory with tears, and said that but for Momokawa he\r\nwould never have reigned over the empire.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Fujiwara were a natural outcome of the\r\nsituation. The Tang systems, which Kamatari, the great founder of the\r\nfamily, had been chiefly instrumental in introducing, placed in the\r\nhands of the sovereign powers much too extensive to be safely\r\nentrusted to a monarch qualified only by heredity. Comprehending the\r\nlogic of their organization, the Chinese made their monarchs' tenure\r\nof authority depend upon the verdict of the nation. But in Japan the\r\ntitle to the crown being divinely bequeathed, there could be no\r\nquestion of appeal to a popular tribunal. So long as men like Kotoku,\r\nTenchi, and Temmu occupied the throne, the Tang polity showed no\r\nflagrant defects. But when the exercise of almost unlimited authority\r\nfell into the hands of a religious fanatic like Shomu, or a\r\nlicentious lady like Koken, it became necessary either that the\r\nprinciple of heredity should be set aside altogether, or that some\r\nmethod of limited selection should be employed.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the Fujiwara became a species of electoral college,\r\nnot possessing, indeed, any recognized mandate from the nation, yet\r\nacting in the nation's behalf to secure worthy occupants for the\r\nthrone. For a time this system worked satisfactorily, but ultimately\r\nit inosculated itself with the views it was designed to nullify, and\r\nthe Fujiwara became flagrant abusers of the power handed down to\r\nthem. Momokawa's immediate followers were worthy to wear his mantle.\r\nTanetsugu, Korekimi, Tsugunawa--these are names that deserve to be\r\nprinted in letters of gold on the pages of Japan's annals. They\r\neither prompted or presided over the reforms and retrenchments that\r\nmarked Kwammu's reign, and personal ambition was never allowed to\r\ninterfere with their duty to the State.\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL PRINCES\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the rise of the Fujiwara to the highest places\r\nwithin reach of a subject, an important alteration took place in the\r\nstatus of Imperial princes. There was no relation of cause and effect\r\nbetween the two things, but in subsequent times events connected them\r\nintimately. According to the Daika legislation, not only sons of\r\nsovereigns but also their descendants to the fifth generation were\r\nclassed as members of the Imperial family and inherited the title of\r\n\"Prince\" (0). Ranks (hon-i) were granted to them and they often\r\nparticipated in the management of State affairs. But no salaries were\r\ngiven to them; they had to support themselves with the proceeds of\r\nsustenance fiefs. The Emperor Kwammu was the first to break away from\r\nthis time-honoured usage. He reduced two of his own sons, born of a\r\nnon-Imperial lady, from the Kwobetsu class to the Shimbetsu,\r\nconferring on them the uji names of Nagaoka and Yoshimine, and he\r\nfollowed the same course with several of the Imperial grandsons,\r\ngiving them the name of Taira.\r\n\r\nThenceforth, whenever a sovereign's offspring was numerous, it became\r\ncustomary to group them with the subject class under a family name. A\r\nprince thus reduced received the sixth official rank (roku-i), and\r\nwas appointed to a corresponding office in the capital or a province,\r\npromotion following according to his ability and on successfully\r\npassing the examination prescribed for Court officials. Nevertheless,\r\nto be divested of the title of \"Prince\" did not mean less of princely\r\nprestige. Such nobles were always primi inter pares. The principal\r\nuji thus created were Nagaoka, Yoshimine, Ariwara, Taira, and\r\nMinamoto.\r\n\r\nTHE TAIRA FAMILY\r\n\r\nPrince Katsurabara was the fifth son of the Emperor Kwammu.\r\nIntelligent, reserved, and a keen student, he is said to have\r\nunderstood the warnings of history as clearly as its incentives. He\r\npetitioned the Throne that the title of should be exchanged in his\r\nchildren's case for that of Taira no Asomi (Marquis of Taira). This\r\nrequest, though several times repeated, was not granted until the\r\ntime (889) of his grandson, Takamochi, who became the first Taira no\r\nAsomi and governor of Kazusa province. He was the grandfather of\r\nMasakado and great-grandfather of Tadamori, names celebrated in\r\nJapanese history. For generations the Taira asomi were appointed\r\ngenerals of the Imperial guards conjointly with the Minamoto, to be\r\npresently spoken of. The name of Taira was conferred also on three\r\nother sons of Kwammu, the Princes Mamta, Kaya, and Nakano, so that\r\nthere were four Tairahouses just as there were four Fujiwara.\r\n\r\nTHE MINAMOTO FAMILY\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Saga (810) had fifty children. From the sixth son\r\ndownwards they were grouped under the uji of Minamoto. All received\r\nappointments to important offices. This precedent was even more\r\ndrastically followed in the days of the Emperor Seiwa (859-876). To\r\nall his Majesty's sons, except the Crown Prince, the uji of Minamoto\r\nwas given. The best known among these early Minamoto was Tsunemoto,\r\ncommonly called Prince Rokuson. He was a grandson of the Emperor\r\nSeiwa, celebrated for two very dissimilar attainments, which,\r\nnevertheless, were often combined in Japan--the art of composing\r\ncouplets and the science of commanding troops. Appointed in the\r\nShohyo era (931-937) to be governor of Musashi, the metropolitan\r\nprovince of modern Japan, his descendants constituted the principal\r\namong fourteen Minamoto houses. They were called the Seiwa Genji, and\r\nnext in importance came the Saga Genji and the Murakami Genji.*\r\n\r\n*That is to say, descended from the Emperor Murakami (947-967). Gen\r\nis the Chinese sound of Minamoto and ji (jshi) represents uji. The\r\nMinamoto are alluded to in history as either the Genji or the\r\nMinamoto. Similarly, hei being the Chinese pronunciation of Taira,\r\nthe latter are indiscriminately spoken of Taira or Heike (ke =\r\nhouse). Both names are often combined into Gen-pei.\r\n\r\nUJI NO CHOJA AND GAKU-IN NO BETTO\r\n\r\nThe imperially descended uji spoken of above, each consisting of\r\nseveral houses, were grouped according to their names, and each group\r\nwas under the supervision of a chief, called uji no choja or uji no\r\ncho. Usually, as has been already stated, the corresponding position\r\nin an ordinary uji was called uji no Kami and belonged to the\r\nfirst-born of the principal house, irrespective of his official rank.\r\nBut in the case of the imperially descended uji, the chief was\r\nselected and nominated by the sovereign with regard to his\r\nadministrative post. With the appointment was generally combined that\r\nof Gaku-in no betto, or commissioner of the academies established for\r\nthe youths of the uji. The principal of these academies was the\r\nKwangaku-in of the Fujiwara. Founded by Fujiwara Fuyutsugu,\r\nminister of the Left, in the year 821, and endowed with a substantial\r\npart of his estate in order to afford educational advantages for the\r\npoorer members of the great family, this institution rivalled even\r\nthe Imperial University, to be presently spoken of. It was under the\r\nsuperintendence of a special commissioner (benkwari).\r\n\r\nNext in importance was the Shogaku-in of the Minamoto, established by\r\nAriwara Yukihira in the year 881. Ariwara being a grandson of the\r\nEmperor Saga, a member of the Saga Genji received the nomination of\r\nchief commissioner; but in the year 1140, the minister of the Right,\r\nMasasada, a member of the Murakami Genji, was appointed to the\r\noffice, and thenceforth it remained in the hands of that house. Two\r\nother educational institutions were the Junna-in of the O-uji and the\r\nGakukwan-in of the Tachibana-iyt, the former dating from the year 834\r\nand the latter from 820. It is not on record that there existed any\r\nspecial school under Taira auspices.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nOne of the principal duties of local governors from the time of the\r\nDaika reforms was to encourage agriculture. A rescript issued by the\r\nEmpress Gensho in the year 715 declared that to enrich the people was\r\nto make the country prosperous, and went on to condemn the practice\r\nof devoting attention to rice culture only and neglecting upland\r\ncrops, so that, in the event of a failure of the former, the latter\r\ndid not constitute a substitute. It was therefore ordered that barley\r\nand millet should be assiduously grown, and each farmer was required\r\nto lay down two tan (2/3 acre) annually of these upland cereals.\r\nRepeated proclamations during the eighth century bear witness to\r\nofficial solicitude in this matter, and in 723 there is recorded a\r\ndistribution of two koku (nearly ten bushels) of seeds, ten feet of\r\ncotton cloth, and a hoe (kuwa) to each agriculturist throughout the\r\nempire. Such largesse suggests a colossal operation, but, in fact, it\r\nmeant little more than the remission of about a year's taxes.\r\nNecessarily, as the population increased, corresponding extension of\r\nthe cultivated area became desirable, and already, in the year 722, a\r\nwork of reclamation on a grand scale was officially undertaken by\r\norganizing a body of peasants and sending them to bring under culture\r\na million cho (two and a half million acres) of new land. This\r\ninteresting measure is recorded without any details whatever.\r\n\r\nPrivate initiative was also liberally encouraged. An Imperial\r\nrescript promised that any farmer harvesting three thousand koku\r\n(fifteen thousand bushels) of cereals from land reclaimed by himself\r\nshould receive the sixth class order of merit (kun roku-to), while a\r\ncrop of over a thousand koku and less than three thousand would carry\r\nlifelong exemption from forced labour. The Daika principle that the\r\nland was wholly the property of the Crown had thus to yield partially\r\nto the urgency of the situation, and during the third decade of the\r\neighth century it was enacted that, if a man reclaimed land by\r\nutilizing aqueducts and reservoirs already in existence, the land\r\nshould belong to him for his lifetime, while if the reservoirs and\r\naqueducts were of his own construction, the right of property should\r\nbe valid for three generations.* From the operation of this law the\r\nprovincial governors were excepted; the usufruct of lands reclaimed\r\nby them was limited to the term of their tenure of office, though, as\r\nrelated already, legislation in their case varied greatly from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\n*This system was called Sansei-isshin no ho. It is, perhaps,\r\nadvisable to note that the Daika system of dividing the land for\r\nsustenance purposes applied only to land already under cultivation.\r\n\r\nFor a certain period the system of \"three generations, or one life\"\r\nworked smoothly enough; but subsequently it was found that as the\r\nlimit of time approached, farmers neglected to till the land and\r\nsuffered it to lie waste. Therefore, in the year 743, the Government\r\nenacted that all reclaimed land should be counted the perpetual\r\nproperty of the reclaimer, with one proviso, namely, that three years\r\nof neglect to cultivate should involve confiscation. The recognition\r\nof private ownership was not unlimited. An area of five hundred cho\r\n(1250 acres) was fixed as the superior limit, applicable only to the\r\ncase of a \"First Class\" prince, the quantities being thereafter on a\r\nsliding scale down to ten cho (twenty-five acres). Any excess\r\nresulting from previous accretions was to revert to the State.\r\nEvidently the effective operation of such a system predicated\r\naccurate surveys and strict supervision. Neither of these conditions\r\nexisted in Japan at that remote period. The prime purpose of the\r\nlegislators was achieved, since the people devoted themselves\r\nassiduously to land reclamation; but by free recourse to their power\r\nof commanding labour, the great families acquired estates largely in\r\nexcess of the legal limit. A feature of the Nara epoch was the\r\nendowment of the Buddhist temples with land by men of all classes,\r\nand the sho-en, or temple domain, thus came into existence.\r\n\r\nSTOCK FARMING\r\n\r\nInformation on the subject of stock farming is scanty and indirect,\r\nbut in the year 713 we find a rescript ordering the provincials of\r\nYamashiro to provide and maintain fifty milch-cows, and in 734,\r\npermission was given that all the districts in the Tokai-do, the\r\nTosan-do, and the Sanin-do might trade freely in cattle and horses.\r\nSeven years later (741), when Shomu occupied the throne, and when\r\nBuddhism spread its protecting mantle over all forms of life, an\r\nedict appeared condemning anyone who killed a horse or an ox to be\r\nflogged with a hundred strokes and to be fined heavily. Only one\r\nother reference to stock farming appears in the annals of the Nara\r\nepoch: the abolition of the two pastures at Osumi and Himeshima in\r\nthe province of Settsu was decreed in 771, but no reason is recorded.\r\n\r\nSERICULTURE\r\n\r\nFrom the remotest times sericulture was assiduously practised in\r\nJapan, the ladies of the Imperial Court, from the Empress downwards,\r\ntaking an active part in the pursuit. The wave of Buddhist zeal which\r\nswept over Japan in the eighth century gave a marked impulse to this\r\nbranch of industry, for the rich robes of the priests constituted a\r\nspecial market.\r\n\r\nORANGES\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in the Chronicles that Tajimamori, a Korean emigrant\r\nof royal descent, was sent to the \"Eternal Land\" by the Emperor\r\nSuinin, in the year A.D. 61, to obtain \"the fragrant fruit that grows\r\nout of season;\" that, after a year's absence, he returned, and\r\nfinding the Emperor dead, committed suicide at his tomb. The\r\n\"fragrant fruit\" is understood to have been the orange, then called\r\ntachibana (Citrus nobilis). If the orange really reached Japan at\r\nthat remote date, it does not appear to have been cultivated there,\r\nfor the importation of orange trees from China is specially mentioned\r\nas an incident of the early Nara epoch.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nOne of the unequivocal benefits bestowed on Japan by Buddhism was a\r\nstrong industrial and artistic impulse. Architecture made notable\r\nprogress owing to the construction of numerous massive and\r\nmagnificent temples and pagodas. One of the latter, erected during\r\nthe reign of Temmu, had a height of thirteen storeys. The arts of\r\ncasting and of sculpture, both in metal and in wood, received great\r\ndevelopment, as did also the lacquer industry. Vermilion lacquer was\r\ninvented in the time of Temmu, and soon five different colours could\r\nbe produced, while to the Nara artisans belongs the inception of\r\nlacquer strewn with makie. Lacquer inlaid with mother-of-pearl was\r\nanother beautiful concept of the Nara epoch. A special tint of red\r\nwas obtained with powdered coral, and gold and silver were freely\r\nused in leaf or in plates. As yet, history does not find any Japanese\r\npainter worthy of record. Chinese and Korean masters remained supreme\r\nin that branch of art.\r\n\r\nTRADE\r\n\r\nCommerce with China and Korea was specially active throughout the\r\neighth century, and domestic trade also nourished. In the capital\r\nthere were two markets where people assembled at noon and dispersed\r\nat sunset. Men and women occupied different sections, and it would\r\nseem that transactions were subject to strict surveillance. Thus, if\r\nany articles of defective quality or adulterated were offered for\r\nsale, they were liable to be confiscated officially, and if a buyer\r\nfound that short measure had been given, he was entitled to return\r\nhis purchase. Market-rates had to be conformed with, and purchasers\r\nwere required to pay promptly. It appears that trees were planted to\r\nserve as shelter or ornament, for we read of \"trees in the Market of\r\nthe East\" and \"orange trees in the market of Kaika.\"\r\n\r\nHABITATIONS\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist temple, lofty, spacious, with towering tiled roof,\r\nmassive pillars and rich decoration of sculpture and painting, could\r\nnot fail to impart an impetus to Japanese domestic architecture,\r\nespecially as this impressive apparition was not evolved gradually\r\nunder the eyes of the nation but was presented to them suddenly in\r\nits complete magnificence. Thus it is recorded that towards the close\r\nof the seventh century, tiled roofs and greater solidity of structure\r\nbegan to distinguish official buildings, as has been already noted.\r\nBut habitations in general remained insignificant and simple. A poem\r\ncomposed by the Dowager Empress Gensho (724) with reference to the\r\ndwelling of Prince Nagaya is instructive:\r\n\r\n   \"Hata susuki\"          (Thatched with miscanthus)\r\n   \"Obana sakafuki\"       (And eularia)\r\n   \"Kuro-ki mochi\"        (Of ebon timbers built, a house)\r\n   \"Tsukureru yado wa\"    (Will live a myriad years.)\r\n   \"Yorozu yo made ni.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture of a nobleman's dwelling in the eighth century is not\r\nimposing. In the very same year the Emperor Shomu, responding to an\r\nappeal from the council of State, issued an edict that officials of\r\nthe fifth rank and upwards and wealthy commoners should build\r\nresidences with tiled roofs and walls plastered in red. This\r\ninjunction was only partly obeyed: tiles came into more general use,\r\nbut red walls offended the artistic instinct of the Japanese. Nearly\r\nfifty years later, when (767-769) the shrine of Kasuga was erected at\r\nNara in memory of Kamatari, founder of the Fujiwara family, its\r\npillars were painted in vermilion, and the fashion inaugurated found\r\nfrequent imitation in later years.\r\n\r\nOf furniture the houses had very little as compared with Western\r\ncustoms. Neither chairs nor bedsteads existed; people sat and slept\r\non the floor, separated from it only by mats made of rice-straw, by\r\ncushions or by woollen carpets, and in aristocratic houses there was\r\na kind of stool to support the arm of the sitter, a lectern, and a\r\ndais for sitting on. Viands were served on tables a few inches high,\r\nand people sat while eating. From the middle of the seventh century a\r\nclepsydra of Chinese origin was used to mark the hours.\r\n\r\nThe first of these instruments is recorded to have been made in A.D.\r\n660, and tradition does not tell what device had previously served\r\nthe purpose. When temple bells came into existence, the hours were\r\nstruck on them for public information, and there is collateral\r\nevidence that some similar system of marking time had been resorted\r\nto from early eras. But the whole story is vague. It seems, however,\r\nthat the method of counting the hours was influenced by the manner of\r\nstriking them. Whether bronze bell or wooden clapper was used, three\r\npreliminary strokes were given by way of warning, and it therefore\r\nbecame inexpedient to designate any of the hours \"one,\" \"two,\" or\r\n\"three.\" Accordingly the initial number was four, and the day being\r\ndivided into six hours, instead of twelve, the highest number became\r\nnine, which corresponded to the Occidental twelve.*\r\n\r\n*There were no subdivisions into minutes and seconds in old Japan.\r\nThe only fraction of an hour was one-half.\r\n\r\nBELLS\r\n\r\nConcerning the bells here mentioned, they are one of the unexplained\r\nachievements of Japanese casters. In Europe the method of producing a\r\nreally fine-toned bell was evolved by \"ages of empirical trials,\" but\r\nin Japan bells of huge size and exquisite note were cast in apparent\r\ndefiance of all the rules elaborated with so much difficulty in the\r\nWest. One of the most remarkable hangs in the belfry of Todai-ji at\r\nNara. It was cast in the year 732 when Shomu occupied the throne; it\r\nis 12 feet 9 inches high; 8 feet 10 inches in diameter; 10 inches\r\nthick, and weighs 49 tons. There are great bells also in the temples\r\nat Osaka and Kyoto, and it is to be noted that early Japanese bronze\r\nwork was largely tributary and subsidiary to temple worship. Temple\r\nbells, vases, gongs, mirrors and lanterns are the principal items in\r\nthis class of metal-working, until a much later period with its\r\nsmaller ornaments.\r\n\r\nVery few references to road making are found in the ancient annals,\r\nbut the reign of the Empress Gensho (715-723) is distinguished as the\r\ntime when the Nakasen-do, or Central Mountain road, was constructed.\r\nIt runs from Nara to Kyoto and thence to the modern Tokyo, traversing\r\nsix provinces en route. Neither history nor tradition tells whether\r\nit was wholly made in the days of Gensho or whether, as seems more\r\nprobable, it was only commenced then and carried to completion in the\r\nreign of Shomu (724-748), when a large force of troops had to be sent\r\nnorthward against the rebellious Yemishi. Doubtless the custom of\r\nchanging the capital on the accession of each sovereign had the\r\neffect of calling many roads into existence, but these were of\r\ninsignificant length compared with a great trunk highway like the\r\nNakasen-do.\r\n\r\nAlong these roads the lower classes travelled on foot; the higher on\r\nhorseback, and the highest in carts drawn by bullocks. For\r\nequestrians who carried official permits, relays of horses could\r\nalways be obtained at posting stations. Among the ox-carts which\r\nserved for carriages, there was a curious type, distinguished by the\r\nfact that between the shafts immediately in front of the dashboard\r\nstood a figure whose outstretched arm perpetually pointed south. This\r\ncompass-cart, known as the \"south-pointing chariot,\" was introduced\r\nfrom China in the year 658. There was also a \"cloud-chariot,\" but\r\nthis served for war purposes only, being a movable erection for\r\noverlooking an enemy's defensive work, corresponding to the turris of\r\nRoman warfare. Borrowed also from China was a battering engine which\r\nmoved on four wheels, and, like the cloud-chariot, dated from 661,\r\nwhen a Tang army invaded Korea.\r\n\r\nHABILIMENTS\r\n\r\nA reader of the Chronicles is struck by the fact that from the close\r\nof the seventh century much official attention seems to have been\r\nbestowed on the subject of costume. Thus, during the last five years\r\nof the Emperor Temmu's reign--namely, from 681--we find no less than\r\nnine sumptuary regulations issued. The first was an edict, containing\r\nninety-two articles, of which the prologue alone survives, \"The\r\ncostumes of all, from the princes of the Blood down to the common\r\npeople, and the wearing of gold and silver, pearls and jewels,\r\npurple, brocade, embroidery, fine silks, together with woollen\r\ncarpets, head-dresses, and girdles, as well as all kinds of coloured\r\nstuffs, are regulated according to a scale, the details of which are\r\ngiven in the written edict.\" In the next year (682), another edict\r\nforbids the wearing of caps of rank, aprons, broad girdles, and\r\nleggings by princes or public functionaries, as well as the use of\r\nshoulder-straps or mantillas by palace stewards or ladies-in-waiting.\r\nThe shoulder-strap was a mark of manual labour, and its use in the\r\npresence of a superior has always been counted as rude in Japan.\r\n\r\nA few days later, this meticulous monarch is found commanding men and\r\nwomen to tie up their hair, eight months being granted to make the\r\nchange, and, at the same time, the practice of women riding astride\r\non horseback came into vogue, showing that female costume had much in\r\ncommon with male. Caps of varnished gauze, after the Chinese type,\r\nbegan to be worn by both sexes simultaneously with the tying-up of\r\nthe hair. Two years later, women of forty years or upwards were given\r\nthe option of tying up their hair or letting it hang loose, and of\r\nriding astride or side-saddle as they pleased. At the same time, to\r\nboth sexes, except on State occasions, liberty of choice was accorded\r\nin the matter of wearing sleeveless jackets fastened in front with\r\nsilk cords and tassels, though in the matter of trousers, men had to\r\ngather theirs in at the bottom with a lace. By and by, the tying up\r\nof the hair by women was forbidden in its turn; the wearing of\r\nleggings was sanctioned, and the colours of Court costumes were\r\nstrictly determined according to the rank of the wearer red, deep\r\npurple, light purple, dark green, light green, deep grape-colour and\r\nlight grape-colour being the order from above downwards.\r\n\r\nAll this attention to costume is suggestive of much refinement. From\r\nthe eighth century even greater care was devoted to the subject. We\r\nfind three kinds of habiliments prescribed--full dress (reifuku),\r\nCourt dress (chofuku) and uniform (seifuku)--with many minor\r\ndistinctions according to the rank of the wearer. Broadly speaking,\r\nthe principal garments were a paletot, trousers, and a narrow girdle\r\ntied in front. The sleeves of the paletot were studiously regulated.\r\nA nobleman wore them long enough to cover his hands, and their\r\nwidth--which in after ages became remarkable--was limited in the Nara\r\nepoch to one foot. The manner of folding the paletot over the breast\r\nseems to have perplexed the legislators for a time. At first they\r\nprescribed that the right should be folded over the left (hidarimae),\r\nbut subsequently (719) an Imperial decree ordered that the left\r\nshould be laid across the right (migimae), and since that day, nearly\r\ntwelve hundred years ago, there has not been any departure from the\r\nlatter rule. Court officials carried a baton (shaku), that, too,\r\nbeing a habit borrowed from China.\r\n\r\nFOOD\r\n\r\nWhen the influence of Buddhism became supreme in Court circles, all\r\ntaking of life for purposes of food was interdicted. The first\r\nprohibitory decree in that sense was issued by Temmu (673-686), and\r\nthe veto was renewed in more peremptory terms by Shomu (724-748),\r\nwhile the Empress Shotoku (765-770) went so far as to forbid the\r\nkeeping of dogs, falcons, or cormorants for hunting or fishing at\r\nShinto ceremonials. But such vetoes were never effectually enforced.\r\nThe great staple of diet was rice, steamed or boiled, and next in\r\nimportance came millet, barley, fish of various kinds (fresh or\r\nsalted), seaweed, vegetables, fruit (pears, chestnuts, etc.), and the\r\nflesh of fowl, deer, and wild boar. Salt, bean-sauce, and vinegar\r\nwere used for seasoning. There were many kinds of dishes; among the\r\ncommonest being soup (atsumono) and a preparation of raw fish in\r\nvinegar (namasu). In the reign of Kotoku (645-654), a Korean named\r\nZena presented a milch cow to the Court, and from that time milk was\r\nrecognized as specially hygienic diet. Thus, when the Daiho laws were\r\npublished at the beginning of the eighth century, dairies were\r\nattached to the medical department, and certain provinces received\r\norders to present butter (gyuraku) for the Court's use.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGES AND FUNERALS\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the marriage ceremony in old Japan. That\r\nthere was a nuptial hut is attested by very early annals, and from\r\nthe time of the Emperor Richu (400-405) wedding presents are\r\nrecorded. But for the rest, history is silent, and it is impossible\r\nto fix the epoch when a set ceremonial began to be observed.\r\n\r\nAs to funerals, there is fuller but not complete information. That a\r\nmortuary chamber was provided for the corpse pending the preparation\r\nof the tomb is shown by the earliest annals, and from an account,\r\npartly allegorical, contained in the records of the prehistoric age,\r\nwe learn that dirges were sung for eight days and eight nights, and\r\nthat in the burial procession were marshalled bearers of viands to be\r\noffered at the grave, bearers of brooms to sweep the path, women who\r\nprepared the viands, and a body of hired mourners. But the Kojiki,\r\ndescribing the same ceremony, speaks of \"making merry\" with the\r\nobject of recalling the dead to life, as the Sun goddess had been\r\nenticed from her cave. From the days of the Emperor Bidatsu\r\n(572-585), we find the first mention of funeral orations, and\r\nalthough the contents of tombs bear witness to the fact that articles\r\nother than food were offered to the deceased, it is not until the\r\nburial of the Emperor's consort, Katachi, (612) that explicit mention\r\nis made of such a custom. On that occasion Tori, omi of the Abe-uji,\r\noffered to the spirit of the dead \"sacred utensils and sacred\r\ngarments, fifteen thousand kinds in all.\" Fifty years later, white is\r\nmentioned as the mourning colour, but when next (683) we hear of\r\nfunerals, it is evident that their realm had been invaded by Chinese\r\ncustoms, for it is recorded that \"officials of the third rank were\r\nallowed at their funerals one hearse, forty drums, twenty great\r\nhorns, forty little horns, two hundred flags, one metal gong, and one\r\nhand-bell, with lamentation for one day.\" At Temmu's obsequies (687)\r\nmention is made of an \"ornamented chaplet,\" the first reference to\r\nthe use of flowers, which constitute such a prominent feature of\r\nBuddhist obsequies.\r\n\r\nBut there is no evidence that Buddhist rites were employed at\r\nfunerals until the death of the retired Emperor Shomu (756).\r\nThereafter, the practice became common. It was also to a Buddhist\r\npriest, Dosho, that Japan owed the inception of cremation. Dying in\r\nthe year 700, Dosho ordered his disciples to cremate his body at\r\nKurihara, and, two years later, the Dowager Empress Jito willed that\r\nher corpse should be similarly disposed of. From the megalithic tombs\r\nof old Japan to the little urn that holds the handful of ashes\r\nrepresenting a cremated body, the transition is immense. It has been\r\nshown that one of the signal reforms of the Daika era was the setting\r\nof limits to the size of sepulchres, a measure which afforded to the\r\nlower classes much relief from forced labour. But an edict issued in\r\n706 shows that the tendance of the resting place of the dead was\r\nstill regarded as a sacred duty, for the edict ordered that, alike at\r\nthe ancestral tombs of the uji and in the residential quarter of the\r\ncommon people, trees should be planted.\r\n\r\nNot yet, however, does the custom of erecting monuments with\r\ninscriptions seem to have come into vogue. The Empress Gemmyo (d.\r\n721) appears to have inaugurated that feature, for she willed not\r\nonly that evergreens should be planted at her grave but also that a\r\ntablet should be set up there. Some historians hold that the donning\r\nof special garments by way of mourning had its origin at that time,\r\nand that it was borrowed from the Tang code of etiquette. But the\r\nChronicles state that in the year A.D. 312, when the Prince Imperial\r\ncommitted suicide rather than occupy the throne, his brother,\r\nOsasagi, \"put on plain unbleached garments and began mourning for\r\nhim.\" White ultimately became the mourning colour, but in the eighth\r\ncentury it was dark,* and mourning habiliments were called\r\nfuji-koromo, because they were made from the bark of the wisteria\r\n(fuji). Among the Daiho statutes was one providing that periods of\r\nmourning should be of five grades, the longest being one year and the\r\nshortest seven days.\r\n\r\n*\"On the death of the Emperor Inkyo (A.D. 453), the Korean Court sent\r\neighty musicians robed in black, who marched in procession to the\r\nYamato palace, playing and singing a dirge as they went.\"\r\n\r\nPASTIMES\r\n\r\nForemost among the pastimes of the Japanese people in all epochs was\r\ndancing. We hear of it in the prehistoric age when the \"monkey\r\nfemale\" (Sarume) performed a pantominic dance before the rock cave of\r\nthe Sun goddess; we hear of it in protohistoric times when Inkyo's\r\nconsort was betrayed into an offer that wrecked her happiness, and we\r\nhear of it in the historic epoch when the future Emperor Kenso danced\r\nin the disguise of a horse-boy. But as the discussion of this subject\r\nbelongs more intelligently to the era following the Nara, we confine\r\nourselves here to noting that even the religious fanatic Shomu is\r\nrecorded as having repaired to the Shujaku gate of the palace to\r\nwitness a performance of song and dance (utagaki) in which 240\r\npersons, men and women, took part; and that, in the same year (734),\r\n230 members of six great uji performed similarly, all robed in blue\r\ngarments fastened in front with long red cords and tassels.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the Japanese has always been to accompany their\r\nfeasting and merry-making with music, versifying, and dancing. At the\r\ntime now under consideration there was the \"winding-water fete\"\r\n(kyoku-sui no en), when princes, high officials, courtiers, and noble\r\nladies seated themselves by the banks of a rivulet meandering gently\r\nthrough some fair park, and launched tiny cups of mulled wine upon\r\nthe current, each composing a stanza as the little messenger reached\r\nhim, or drinking its contents by way of penalty for lack of poetic\r\ninspiration. There were also the flower festivals--that for the plum\r\nblossoms, that for the iris, and that for the lotus, all of which\r\nwere instituted in this same Nara epoch--when the composition of\r\ncouplets was quite as important as the viewing of the flowers. There\r\nwas, further, the grand New Year's banquet in the Hall of\r\nTranquillity at the Court, when all officials from the sixth grade\r\ndownwards sang a stanza of loyal gratitude, accompanying themselves\r\non the lute (koto). It was an era of refined effeminate amusements.\r\nWrestling had now become the pursuit of professionals. Aristocrats\r\nengaged in no rougher pastime than equestrian archery, a species of\r\nfootball, hawking, and hunting. Everybody gambled. It was in vain\r\nthat edicts were issued against dicing (chobo and sugoroku). The vice\r\ndefied official restraint.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE AND POETRY\r\n\r\nHaving no books of her own, Japan naturally borrowed freely from the\r\nrich mine of Chinese literature. By the tutors of the Imperial\r\nfamily, at the colleges of the capital, and in the provincial schools\r\nthe classics constituted virtually the whole curriculum. The\r\nadvantages of education were, however, enjoyed by a comparatively\r\nsmall element of the population. During the Nara epoch, it does not\r\nappear that there were more than five thousand students attending the\r\nschools and colleges at one time. The aim of instruction was to\r\nprepare men for official posts rather than to impart general culture\r\nor to encourage scientific research. Students were therefore selected\r\nfrom the aristocrats or the official classes only. There were no\r\nprinted books; everything had to be laboriously copied by hand, and\r\nthus the difficulties of learning were much enhanced. To be able to\r\nadapt the Chinese ideographs skilfully to the purposes of written\r\nJapanese was a feat achieved by comparatively few. What the task\r\ninvolved has been roughly described in the opening chapter of this\r\nvolume, and with what measure of success it was achieved may be\r\nestimated from the preface to the Records (Kojiki), written by Ono\r\nYasumaro, from the Chronicles (Nihon Shoki) and from the Daiho\r\nRitsu-ryo, which three works may be called the sole surviving prose\r\nessays of the epoch.\r\n\r\nMuch richer, however, is the realm of poetry. It was during the Nara\r\nepoch that the first Japanese anthology, the Manyo-shu (Collection of\r\na Myriad Leaves), was compiled. It remains to this day a revered\r\nclassic and \"a whole mountain of commentary has been devoted to the\r\nelucidation of its obscurities.\" [Chamberlain.] In the Myriad Leaves\r\nare to be found poems dating nominally from the reigns of Yuryaku and\r\nNintoku, as well as from the days of Shotoku Taishi, but much more\r\nnumerous are those of Jomei's era (629-641) and especially those of\r\nthe Nara epoch. The compiler's name is not known certainly; he is\r\nbelieved to have been either Tachibana no Moroe or Otomo no\r\nYakamochi. Old manuscripts and popular memory were the sources, and\r\nthe verselets total 4496, in twenty volumes. Some make love their\r\ntheme; some deal with sorrow; some are allegorical; some draw their\r\ninspiration from nature's beauties, and some have miscellaneous\r\nmotives. Hitomaru, who flourished during the reign of the Empress\r\nJito (690-697), and several of whose verses are to be found in the\r\nMyriad Leaves, has been counted by all generations the greatest of\r\nJapanese poets. Not far below him in fame is Akahito, who wrote in\r\nthe days of Shomu (724-749). To the same century--the eighth--as the\r\nManyo-shu, belongs the Kiraifu-so, & volume containing 120 poems in\r\nChinese style, composed by sixty-four poets during the reigns of\r\nTemmu, Jito, and Mommu, that is to say, between 673 and 707. Here\r\nagain the compiler's name is unknown, but the date of compilation is\r\nclear, November, 751.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that, while bequeathing to posterity only two national\r\nhistories and a few provincial records (the Fudo-ki), the Nara epoch\r\nhas left two anthologies, it will be inferred readily that the\r\nwriting of poetry was a favourite pursuit in that age. Such, indeed,\r\nwas the case. The taste developed almost into a mania. Guests bidden\r\nto a banquet were furnished with writing materials and invited to\r\nspend hours composing versicles on themes set by their hosts. But\r\nskill in writing verse was not merely a social gift; it came near to\r\nbeing a test of fitness for office.\r\n\r\n\"In their poetry above everything the Japanese have remained\r\nimpervious to alien influences. It owes this conservation to its\r\nprosody. Without rhyme, without variety of metre, without elasticity\r\nof dimensions, it is also without known counterpart. To alter it in\r\nany way would be to deprive it of all distinguishing characteristics.\r\nAt some remote date a Japanese maker of songs seems to have\r\ndiscovered that a peculiar and very fascinating rhythm is produced by\r\nlines containing 5 syllables and 7 syllables alternately. That is\r\nJapanese poetry (uta or tanka). There are generally five lines: the\r\nfirst and third consisting of 5 syllables, the second, fourth and\r\nfifth of 7, making a total of 31 in all. The number of lines is not\r\ncompulsory: sometimes they may reach to thirty, forty or even more,\r\nbut the alternation of 5 and 7 syllables is compulsory. The most\r\nattenuated form of all is the hokku (or haikai) which consists of\r\nonly three lines, namely, 17 syllables. Necessarily the ideas\r\nembodied in such a narrow vehicle must be fragmentary. Thus it\r\nresults that Japanese poems are, for the most part, impressionist;\r\nthey suggest a great deal more than they actually express. Here is an\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n   Momiji-ha wo\r\n   Kaze ni makasete\r\n   Miru yori mo\r\n   Hakanaki mono wa\r\n   Inochi nari keri\r\n\r\nThis may be translated:\r\n\r\nMore fleeting than the glint of withered leaf wind-blown, the thing\r\ncalled life.\"*\r\n\r\n*See Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, article \"Japan.\"\r\n\r\nThe sketchy nature of Japanese poetry, especially in this five-line\r\nstanza, may be illustrated further by two poems quoted by Prof. B. H.\r\nChamberlain in his \"Things Japanese\" (pp. 375-376),\r\n\r\nThe first:\r\n\r\n   Hototogisu\r\n   Nakitsuru kata wo\r\n   Nagamureba--\r\n   Tada ari-ake no\r\n   Tsuki zo nokoreru\r\n\r\nis literally translated by Professor Chamberlain as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When I gaze towards the place where the cuckoo has been singing,\r\nnought remains but the moon in the early dawn.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the conventional and pictorial character of the literary form is\r\nillustrated again in the lines:\r\n\r\n   Shira-kumo ni\r\n   Hane uchi-kawashi\r\n   Tobu kari no\r\n   Kazu sae miyuru\r\n   Aki no yo no tsuki!\r\n\r\nwhich the same eminent scholar translates: \"The moon on an autumn\r\nnight making visible the very number of the wild-geese that fly past\r\nwith wings intercrossed in the white clouds.\" It is to be noted that\r\nthis last is, to Occidental notions, a mere poetic phrase and not a\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nOf course, the very exigencies of the case make the three-line stanza\r\n(or hokku), containing only 17 syllables, even more sketchy--hardly\r\nmore indeed than a tour de force composed of a limited number of\r\nbrush strokes! The Western critic, with his totally different\r\nliterary conventions, has difficulty in bringing himself to regard\r\nJapanese verse as a literary form or in thinking of it otherwise than\r\nas an exercise in ingenuity, an Oriental puzzle; and this notion is\r\nheightened by the prevalence of the couplet-composing contests, which\r\ndid much to heighten the artificiality of the genre.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN THE SEXES\r\n\r\nThere was probably no more shocking sexual vice or irregularity in\r\nthe Nara epoch than there had been before nor than there was\r\nafterwards. The only evidence adduced to prove that there was\r\nanything of the sort is the fact that laws were promulgated looking\r\nto the restraint of illicit intercourse. These laws seem to have\r\naccomplished little or nothing and the existence of the laws argues\r\nrather a growing sense of the seriousness of the evil than any sudden\r\nincrease in the prevalence of the evil itself. There can be no\r\nquestion, however, of the wide diffusion of concubinage in this\r\nperiod. Not morals nor repute nor public opinion, but the wealth and\r\nwishes of each man limited him in his amours of this sort. The\r\nessential of a virtuous woman was that she be faithful to her husband\r\nor lover; no such faithfulness was expected of him. And neither in\r\nthe case of man nor woman did the conventions of the period depend at\r\nall on the nature of the relationship between the two. Wives no\r\nlonger lived in their fathers' homes after marriage, but the\r\nnewly-wedded husband built new rooms for his wife's especial use, so\r\nthat, by a fiction such as the Oriental delights in and Occidental\r\nlaw is not entirely ignorant of, her home was still not his. Before\r\nbetrothal, girls were not allowed to call themselves by a family\r\nname. At the betrothal her affianced first bound up in a fillet the\r\nhair that she had formerly worn loose around her face. Even more\r\nsymbolical was the custom upon lovers' parting of tying to the\r\nwoman's undergarment a string from the man's; this knot was to be\r\nunloosed only when they met again.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOSO-IN\r\n\r\nAt Nara, in Yamato province, near the temple of Todai-ji, a store\r\nhouse built of wood and called the Shoso-in was constructed in the\r\nNara epoch, and it still stands housing a remarkable collection of\r\nfurniture and ornaments from the Imperial palace. There is some\r\nquestion whether this collection is truly typical of the period, or\r\neven of the palace of the period; but the presence of many utensils\r\nfrom China, some from India (often with traces of Greek influence),\r\nand a few from Persia certainly shows the degree of cosmopolitan\r\nculture and elegance there was in the palace at Nara. At the present\r\nday, strangers may visit the collection only by special permission\r\nand only on two days each year; and the museum has always had a\r\nmingled imperial and sacred character. When the power of the\r\nshogunate was at its height, the Shoso-in was never opened except by\r\norders of the Emperor. Among the contents of this museum are:\r\npolished mirrors with repousse backs, kept in cases lined with\r\nbrocaded silk; bronze vases; bronze censers; hicense-boxes made of\r\nPaulownia wood or of Chinese ware; two-edged swords, which were tied\r\nto the girdle, instead of being thrust through it; narrow leather\r\nbelts with silver or jade decoration; bamboo flutes; lacquer\r\nwriting-cases, etc.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE SHOSO-IN AT NARA\r\n\r\nREFORM OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS\r\n\r\nTo the Emperor Konin belongs the credit of correcting some flagrant\r\nabuses in provincial administration. There was an inconvenient\r\noutcome of the religious mania which pervaded the upper classes\r\nduring the reigns of Shomu and Koken. To meet the expense of building\r\ntemples and casting images, men of substance in the provinces were\r\nurged to make contributions of money, cereals, or land, and in return\r\nfor this liberality they were granted official posts. It resulted\r\nthat no less than thirty-one supernumerary provincial governors were\r\nborne on the roll at one time, and since all these regarded office as\r\na means of recouping the cost of nomination, taxpayers and persons\r\nliable to the corvée fared ill. In 774, Koken issued an edict that\r\nprovincial governors who had held office for five years or upwards\r\nshould be dismissed at once, those of shorter terms being allowed to\r\ncomplete five years and then removed.\r\n\r\nAnother evil, inaugurated during the reign of Shomu, when faith in\r\nthe potency of supernatural influences obsessed men's minds, was\r\nseverely dealt with by Konin. Office-seekers resorted to the device\r\nof contriving conflagrations of official property, rewarding the\r\nincendiaries with the plunder, and circulating rumours that these\r\ncalamities were visitations of heaven to punish the malpractices of\r\nthe provincial governors in whose jurisdictions they occurred. It is\r\non record that, in several cases, these stories led to the dismissal\r\nof governors and their replacement by their traducers. Konin decreed\r\nthat such crimes should be punished by the death of all concerned.\r\nThese reforms, supplemented by the removal of many superfluous\r\nofficials, earned for Konin such popularity that for the first time\r\nin Japan's history, the sovereign's birthday became a festival*,\r\nthereafter celebrated through all ages.\r\n\r\n*Called Tenchosetsu.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that compulsory military service was introduced in\r\n689, during the reign of the Empress Jito, one-fourth of all the\r\nable-bodied men in each province being required to serve a fixed time\r\nwith the colours. It has also been noted that under the Daiho\r\nlegislation the number was increased to one-third. This meant that no\r\ndistinction existed between soldier and peasant. The plan worked ill.\r\nNo sufficient provision of officers being made, the troops remained\r\nwithout training, and it frequently happened that, instead of\r\nmilitary exercises, they were required to labour for the enrichment\r\nof a provincial governor.\r\n\r\nThe system, being thus discredited, fell into abeyance in the year\r\n739, but that it was not abolished is shown by the fact that, in 780,\r\nwe find the privy council memorializing the Throne in a sense\r\nunfavourable to the drafting of peasants into the ranks. The memorial\r\nalleged that the men lacked training; that they were physically\r\nunfit; that they busied themselves devising pretexts for evasion;\r\nthat their chief function was to perform fatigue-duty for local\r\ngovernors, and that to send such men into the field of battle would\r\nbe to throw away their lives fruitlessly. The council recommended\r\nthat indiscriminate conscription of peasants should be replaced by a\r\nsystem of selection, the choice being limited to men with some\r\nprevious training; that the number taken should be in proportion to\r\nthe size of the province, and that those not physically robust should\r\nbe left to till the land. These recommendations were approved. They\r\nconstituted the first step towards complete abolishment of compulsory\r\nservice and towards the glorifying of the profession of arms above\r\nthat of agriculture. Experience quickly proved, however, that some\r\nmore efficient management was necessary in the maritime provinces,\r\nand in 792, Kwammu being then on the throne, an edict abolished the\r\nprovincial troops in all regions except those which, by their\r\nproximity to the continent of Asia, were exposed to danger, namely,\r\nDazai-fu in Kyushu, and in Mutsu, Dewa, and Sado in the north. Some\r\nspecially organized force was needed also for extraordinary service\r\nand for guarding official storehouses, offices, and places where\r\npost-bells (suzu) were kept. To that end the system previously\r\npractised during the reign of Shomu (724-749) was reverted to; that\r\nis to say, the most robust among the sons and younger brothers of\r\nprovincial governors and local officials were enrolled in corps of\r\nstrength varying with the duties to be performed. These were called\r\nkondei or kenji. We learn from the edict that the abuse of employing\r\nsoldiers as labourers was still practised, but of course this did not\r\napply to the kondei.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the time was against imposing military service on the\r\nlower classes. During the period 810-820, the forces under the\r\nDazai-fu jurisdiction, that is to say, in the six provinces of\r\nChikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, Higo, Buzen, and Bungo, were reduced from\r\n17,100 to 9000. Dazai-fu and Mutsu being littoral regions, the\r\nconscription system still existed there, but in Mutsu there were not\r\nonly heishi, that is to say, local militiamen of the ordinary type\r\nand kenji or kondei, but also chimpei, or guards who were required to\r\nserve at a distance from home. Small farmers, upon whom this duty\r\ndevolved, had no choice but to take their wives and children with\r\nthem, the family subsisting on the pittance given as rations eked out\r\nby money realized from sales of chattels and garments. Thus, on the\r\nexpiration of their service they returned to their native place in a\r\nwholly destitute condition, and sometimes perished of hunger on the\r\nway. In consideration of the hardships of such a system, it was\r\nabolished, and thus the distinction between the soldier and the\r\npeasant received further accentuation.\r\n\r\nThere is no record as to the exact dimensions of Japan's standing\r\narmy in the ninth century, but if we observe that troops were raised\r\nin the eight littoral provinces only--six in the south and two in the\r\nnorth--and in the island of Sado, and that the total number in the\r\nsix southern provinces was only nine thousand, it would seem\r\nreasonable to conclude that the aggregate did not exceed thirty\r\nthousand. There were also the kondei (or kenji), but these, since\r\nthey served solely as guards or for special purposes, can scarcely be\r\ncounted a part of the standing army. The inference is that whatever\r\nthe Yamato race may have been when it set out upon its original\r\ncareer of conquest, or when, in later eras, it sent great armies to\r\nthe Asiatic continent, the close of the fifth cycle after the coming\r\nof Buddhism found the country reduced to a condition of comparative\r\nmilitary weakness. As to that, however, clearer judgment may be\r\nformed in the context of the campaign--to be now spoken of--conducted\r\nby the Yamato against the Yemishi tribes throughout a great part of\r\nthe eighth century and the early years of the ninth.\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF THE YEMISHI\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the close of the third decade of the eighth\r\ncentury saw the capital established at Nara amid conditions of great\r\nrefinement, and saw the Court and the aristocracy absorbed in\r\nreligious observances, while the provincial governments were, in many\r\ncases, corrupt and inefficient. In the year 724, Nara received news\r\nof an event which illustrated the danger of such a state of affairs.\r\nThe Yemishi of the east had risen in arms and killed Koyamaro, warden\r\nof Mutsu. At that time the term \"Mutsu\" represented a much wider area\r\nthan the modern region of the same name: it comprised the five\r\nprovinces now distinguished as Iwaki, Iwashiro, Rikuzen, Rikuchu, and\r\nMutsu--in other words, the whole of the northeastern and northern\r\nlittoral of the main island. Similarly, the provinces now called Ugo\r\nand Uzen, which form the northwestern littoral, were comprised in the\r\nsingle term \"Dewa.\" Nature has separated these two regions, Mutsu and\r\nDewa, by a formidable chain of mountains, constituting the backbone\r\nof northern Japan. Within Dewa, Mutsu, and the island of Yezo, the\r\naboriginal Yemishi had been held since Yamato-dake's signal campaign\r\nin the second century A.D., and though not so effectually quelled as\r\nto preclude all danger of insurrection, their potentialities caused\r\nlittle uneasiness to the Central Government.\r\n\r\nBut there was no paltering with the situation which arose in 724.\r\nRecourse was immediately had to the Fujiwara, whose position at the\r\nImperial Court was paramount, and Umakai, grandson of the renowned\r\nKamatari, set out at the head of thirty thousand men, levied from the\r\neight Bands provinces, by which term Sagami, Musashi, Awa, Kazusa,\r\nShimosa, Hitachi, Kotsuke, and Shimotsuke were designated. The\r\nexpanded system of conscription established under the Daiho code was\r\nthen in force, and thus a large body of troops could easily be\r\nassembled. Umakai's army did not experience any serious resistance.\r\nBut neither did it achieve anything signal. Marching by two routes,\r\nit converged on the castle of Taga, a fortress just constructed by\r\nOno Azumahito, the lord warden of the Eastern Marches. The plan\r\npursued by the Yamato commanders was to build castles and barriers\r\nalong the course of rivers giving access to the interior, as well as\r\nalong the coast line. Taga Castle was the first of such works, and,\r\nby the year 767, the programme had been carried in Mutsu as far as\r\nthe upper reaches of the Kitakami River,* and in Dewa as far as\r\nAkita.\r\n\r\n*A monument still stands on the site of the old Taga Castle. It was\r\nput up in A.D. 762, and it records that the castle stood fifty miles\r\nfrom the island of Yezo.\r\n\r\nHistory has nothing further to tell about the Yemishi until the year\r\n774, when they again took up arms, captured one (Mono) of the\r\nJapanese forts and drove out its garrison. Again the eight Bando\r\nprovinces were ordered to send levies, and at the head of the army\r\nthus raised a Japanese general penetrated far into Mutsu and\r\ndestroyed the Yemishi's chief stronghold. This success was followed\r\nby an aggressive policy on the part of the lord-warden, Ki no\r\nHirozumi. He extended the chain of forts to Kabe in Dewa, and to\r\nIsawa in Mutsu. This was in 780. But there ensued a strong movement\r\nof reprisal on the part of the Yemishi. Led by Iharu no Atamaro, they\r\noverwhelmed Hirozumi's army, killed the lord-warden himself, and\r\npushed on to Taga Castle, which they burned, destroying vast stores\r\nof arms and provisions. It was precisely at this time that the State\r\ncouncil, as related above, memorialized the Throne, denouncing the\r\nincompetency of the provincial conscripts and complaining that the\r\nprovincial authorities, instead of training the soldiers, used them\r\nfor forced labour. The overthrow of the army in Mutsu and the\r\ndestruction of Taga Castle justified this memorial.\r\n\r\nThe Court appointed Fujiwara Tsugunawa to take command of a punitive\r\nexpedition, and once again Bando levies converged on the site of the\r\ndismantled castle of Taga. But beyond that point no advance was\r\nessayed, in spite of bitter reproaches from Nara. \"In summer,\" wrote\r\nthe Emperor (Konin), \"you plead that the grass is too dry; in winter\r\nyou allege that bran is too scant. You discourse adroitly but you get\r\nno nearer to the foe.\" Konin's death followed shortly afterwards, but\r\nhis successor, Kwammu, zealously undertook the pursuit of the\r\ncampaign. Notice was sent (783) to the provincial authorities\r\ndirecting them to make preparations and to instruct the people that\r\nan armed expedition was inevitable. News had just been received of\r\nfresh outrages in Dewa. The Yemishi had completely dispersed and\r\ndespoiled the inhabitants of two districts, so that it was found\r\nnecessary to allot lands to them elsewhere and to erect houses for\r\ntheir shelter.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor said in his decree that the barbarian tribes, when\r\npursued, fled like birds; when unmolested, gathered like ants; that\r\nthe conscripts from the Bando provinces were reported to be weak and\r\nunfit for campaigning, and that those skilled in archery and\r\nphysically robust stood aloof from military service, forgetting that\r\nthey all owed a common duty to their country and their sovereign.\r\nTherefore, his Majesty directed that the sons and younger brothers of\r\nall local officials or provincial magnates should be examined with a\r\nview to the selection of those suited for military service, who\r\nshould be enrolled and drilled, to the number of not less than five\r\nhundred and not more than two thousand per province according to its\r\nsize. Thus, the eight Bando provinces must have furnished a force of\r\nfrom four to sixteen thousand men, all belonging to the aristocratic\r\nclass. These formed the nucleus of the army. They were supplemented\r\nby 52,800 men, infantry and cavalry, collected from the provinces\r\nalong the Eastern Sea (Tokai) and the Eastern Mountains (Tosan). so\r\nthat the total force must have aggregated sixty thousand. The command\r\nin chief was conferred on Ki no Kosami, thirteenth in descent from\r\nthe renowned Takenouchi-no-Sukune, who had been second in command of\r\nthe Fujiwara Tsugunawa expedition nine years previously. A sword was\r\nconferred on him by the Emperor, and he received authority to act on\r\nhis own discretion without seeking instructions from the Throne.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the province of Mutsu had been ordered to send 35,000 koku\r\n(175,000 bushels) of hulled rice to Taga Castle, and the other\r\nprovinces adjacent were required to store 23,000 koku (115,000\r\nbushels) of hoshi-i (rice boiled and dried) and salt at the same\r\nplace. The troops were to be massed at Taga, and all the provisions\r\nand munitions were collected there by April, 789. These figures are\r\nsuggestive of the light in which the Government regarded the affair.\r\nKosami moved out of Taga at the appointed time and pushed northward.\r\nBut with every forward movement the difficulties multiplied. Snow in\r\nthose regions lies many feet deep until the end of May, and the thaw\r\nensuing brings down from the mountains heavy floods which convert the\r\nrivers into raging torrents and the roads into quagmires. On reaching\r\nthe bank of the Koromo River, forty-five miles north of Taga, the\r\ntroops halted. Their delay provoked much censure in the capital where\r\nthe climatic conditions do not appear to have been fully understood\r\nor the transport difficulties appreciated. Urged by the Court to push\r\non rapidly, Kosami resumed his march in June; failed to preserve\r\nefficient connexion between the parts of his army; had his van\r\nambushed; fled precipitately himself, and suffered a heavy defeat,\r\nthough only 2500 of his big army had come into action. His casualties\r\nwere 25 killed, 245 wounded, and 1036 drowned. A truce was effected\r\nand the forces withdrew to Taga, while, as for Kosami, though he\r\nattempted to deceive the Court by a bombastic despatch, he was\r\nrecalled and degraded together with all the senior officers of his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as though this disaster to one comparatively small\r\nsection of a force aggregating from fifty to sixty thousand men need\r\nnot have finally interrupted the campaign, especially when the enemy\r\nconsisted of semi-civilized aborigines. The Government thought\r\ndifferently, however. There was no idea of abandoning the struggle,\r\nbut the programme for its renewal assumed large dimensions, and\r\nevents in the capital were not propitious for immediate action. The\r\ntraining of picked soldiers commenced at once, and the provision of\r\narms and horses. Kosami's discomfiture took place in 789, and during\r\nthe next two years orders were issued for the manufacture of 2000\r\nsuits of leather armour and 3000 of iron armour; the making of 34,500\r\narms, and the preparation of 1 10,000 bushels of hoshi-i. To the\r\ncommand-in-chief the Emperor (Kwammu) appointed Saka-no-ye no\r\nTamuramaro.\r\n\r\nThis selection illustrates a conclusion already proved by the annals,\r\nnamely, that racial prejudice had no weight in ancient Japan. For\r\nTamuramaro was a direct descendant of that Achi no Omi who, as\r\nalready related, crossed from China during the Han dynasty and became\r\nnaturalized in Japan. His father, Karitamaro, distinguished himself\r\nby reporting the Dokyo intrigue, in the year 770, and received the\r\npost of chief of the palace guards, in which corps his son,\r\nTamuramaro, thereafter served. Tradition has assigned supernatural\r\ncapacities to Tamuramaro, and certainly in respect of personal\r\nprowess no less than strategical talent he was highly gifted. In\r\nJune, 794, he invaded Mutsu at the head of a great army and, by a\r\nseries of rapidly delivered blows, effectually crushed the\r\naborigines, taking 457 heads, 100 prisoners, and 85 horses, and\r\ndestroying the strongholds of 75 tribes. Thereafter, until the year\r\nof his death (811), he effectually held in check the spirit of\r\nrevolt, crushing two other insurrections--in 801 and 804--and\r\nvirtually annihilating the insurgents. He transferred the garrison\r\nheadquarters from Taga to Isawa, where he erected a castle,\r\norganizing a body of four thousand militia (tonden-hei) to guard it;\r\nand in the following year (803), he built the castle of Shiba at a\r\npoint still further north.\r\n\r\nNATIONALITY OF THE INSURGENTS\r\n\r\nAnnals of historical repute are confined to the above account. There\r\nis, however, one unexplained feature, which reveals itself to even a\r\ncasual reader. In their early opposition to Yamato aggression, the\r\nYemishi--or Ainu, or Yezo, by whatever name they be called--displayed\r\nno fighting qualities that could be called formidable. Yet now, in\r\nthe eighth century, they suddenly show themselves men of such prowess\r\nthat the task of subduing them taxes the resources of the Yamato to\r\nthe fullest. Some annalists are disposed to seek an explanation of\r\nthis discrepancy in climatic and topographical difficulties. Kosami,\r\nin his despatch referring to the Koromo-gawa campaign, explains that\r\n12,440 men had to be constantly employed in transporting provisions\r\nand that the quantity carried by them in twenty-four days did not\r\nexceed eleven days' rations for the troops. The hardship of\r\ncampaigning in a country where means of communication were so\r\ndefective is easily conjectured, and it has also to be noted that\r\nduring only a brief period in summer did the climate of Mutsu permit\r\ntaking the field. But these conditions existed equally in the eras of\r\nYamato-dake and Hirafu. Whatever obstacles they presented in the\r\neighth century must have been equally potent in the second and in the\r\nseventh.\r\n\r\nTwo explanations are offered. They are more or less conjectural. One\r\nis that the Yemishi of Mutsu were led by chieftains of Yamato origin,\r\nmen who had migrated to the northeast in search of fortune or\r\nimpelled by disaffection. It seems scarcely credible, however, that a\r\nfact so special would have eluded historical reference, whereas only\r\none passing allusion is made to it and that, too, in a book not fully\r\ncredible. The other explanation is that the Yemishi were in league\r\nwith hordes of Tatars who had crossed from the mainland of Asia, or\r\ntravelled south by the islands of Saghalien and Yezo. The main\r\nevidence in support of this theory is furnished by the names of the\r\ninsurgent leaders Akuro-o, Akagashira, and Akahige. Ideographists\r\npoint out that the character aku is frequently pronounced o, and with\r\nthat reading the name \"Akuro-o\" becomes \"Oro-o,\" which was the term\r\nused for \"Russian.\" As for \"Akagashira\" and \"Akahige,\" they frankly\r\nsignify \"red head\" and \"red beard,\" common Japanese names for\r\nforeigners. In a shrine at Suzuka-yama in Ise, to which point the\r\ninsurgents pushed southward before Tamuramaro took the field, there\r\nused to be preserved a box, obviously of foreign construction, said\r\nto have been left there by the \"Eastern Barbarians;\" and in the\r\nTsugaru district of the modern Mutsu province, relics exist of an\r\nextensive fortress presenting features not Japanese, which is\r\nconjectured to have been the basis of the Tatar invaders. But all\r\nthese inferences rest on little more than hypothesis.\r\n\r\nRISE OF MILITARY HOUSES\r\n\r\nWhat is certain, however, is that a collateral result of these\r\ndisturbances was to discredit the great Court nobles--the Otomo, the\r\nTachibana, the Ki, and the Fujiwara--as leaders of armies, and to lay\r\nthe foundation of the military houses (buke) which were destined to\r\nbecome feudal rulers of Japan in after ages. Ki no Hirozumi, Ki no\r\nKosami, Otomo Yakamochi, Fujiwara Umakai, and Fujiwara Tsugunawa\r\nhaving all failed, the Court was compelled to have recourse to the\r\nrepresentatives of a Chinese immigrant family, the Saka-no-ye. By\r\nthose who trace the ringer of fate in earthly happenings, it has been\r\ncalled a dispensation that, at this particular juncture, a descendant\r\nof Achi no Omi should have been a warrior with a height of six feet\r\nnine inches,* eyes of a falcon, a beard like plaited gold-wire, a\r\nfrown that terrified wild animals, and a smile that attracted\r\nchildren. For such is the traditional description of Tamuramaro.\r\nAnother incidental issue of the situation was that conspicuous credit\r\nfor fighting qualities attached to the troops specially organized in\r\nthe Bando (Kwanto) provinces with the sons and younger brothers of\r\nlocal officials. These became the nucleus of a military class which\r\nultimately monopolized the profession of arms.\r\n\r\n*The height recorded is five feet eight inches, but as that would be\r\na normal stature, there can be little doubt that \"great\" (dai)\r\nmeasure is referred to and that the figures indicate six feet nine\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH KOREA\r\n\r\nDuring the eighth century relations of friendship were once more\r\nestablished with Koma. A Manchurian tribe, migrating from the valley\r\nof the Sungali River (then called the Sumo), settled on the east of\r\nthe modern province of Shengking, and was there joined by a remnant\r\nof the Koma subjects after the fall of the latter kingdom. Ultimately\r\nreceiving investiture at the hands of the Tang Court, the sovereign\r\nof the colony took the name of Tsuying, King of Pohai, and his son,\r\nWu-i, sent an envoy to Japan in 727, when Shomu was on the throne.\r\nWhere the embassy embarked there is no record, but, being blown out\r\nof their course, the boats finally made the coast of Dewa, where\r\nseveral of the envoy's suite were killed by the Yemishi. The envoy\r\nhimself reached Nara safely, and, representing his sovereign as the\r\nsuccessor of the Koma dynasty, was hospitably received, the usual\r\ninterchange of gifts taking place.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later (752), another envoy arrived. The Empress\r\nKoken then reigned at Nara, and her ministers insisted that, in the\r\ndocument presented by the ambassador, Pohai must distinctly occupy\r\ntowards Japan the relation of vassal to suzerain, such having been\r\nthe invariable custom observed by Koma in former times. The\r\ndifficulty seems to have been met by substituting the name \"Koma\" for\r\n\"Pohai,\" thus, by implication, admitting that the new kingdom held\r\ntowards Japan the same status as that formerly held by Koma.\r\nThroughout the whole of her subsequent intercourse with the Pohai\r\nkingdom, intercourse which, though exceedingly fitful, lasted for\r\nnearly a century and a half, Japan uniformly insisted upon the\r\nmaintenance of that attitude.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: EMPEROR KWAMMU\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE HEIAN EPOCH\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTIETH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KWAMMU (A.D. 782-805)\r\n\r\nJAPANESE history divides itself readily into epochs, and among them\r\nnot the least sharply defined is the period of 398 years separating\r\nthe transfer of the Imperial palace from Nara to Kyoto (794) and the\r\nestablishment of an administrative capital at Kamakura (1192). It is\r\ncalled the Heian epoch, the term \"Heian-jo\" (Castle of Peace) having\r\nbeen given to Kyoto soon after that city became the residence of the\r\nMikado. The first ruler in the epoch was Kwammu. This monarch, as\r\nalready shown, was specially selected by his father, Konin, at the\r\ninstance of Fujiwara Momokawa, who observed in the young prince\r\nqualities essential to a ruler of men. Whether Kwammu's career as\r\nEmperor reached the full standard of his promise as prince,\r\nhistorians are not agreed.\r\n\r\nKonin receives a larger meed of praise. His reforms of local abuses\r\nshowed at once courage and zeal But he did not reach the root of the\r\nevil, nor did his son Kwammu, though in the matter of intention and\r\nardour there was nothing to choose between the two. The basic trouble\r\nwas arbitrary and unjust oppression of the lower classes by the\r\nupper. These latter, probably educated in part by the be system,\r\nwhich tended to reduce the worker with his hands to a position of\r\nmarked subservience, had learned to regard their own hereditary\r\nprivileges as practically unlimited, and to conclude that well nigh\r\nany measure of forced labour was due to them from their inferiors.\r\nKonin could not correct this conception, and neither could Kwammu.\r\nIndeed, in the latter's case, the Throne was specially disqualified\r\nas a source of remonstrance, for the sovereign himself had to make\r\nextravagant demands upon the working classes on account of the\r\ntransfer of the capital from Nara to Kyoto. Thus, although Kwammu's\r\nwarnings and exhortations were earnest, and his dismissals and\r\ndegradations of provincial officials frequent, he failed to achieve\r\nanything radical.\r\n\r\nTRANSFER OF THE CAPITAL TO KYOTO\r\n\r\nThe reign of Kwammu is remarkable for two things: the conquest of the\r\neastern Yemishi by Tamuramaro and the transfer of the capital from\r\nNara to Kyoto. Nara is in the province of Yamato; Kyoto, in the\r\nneighbouring province of Yamashiro,* and the two places lie twenty\r\nmiles apart as the crow flies. It has been stated that to change the\r\nsite of the capital on the accession of a sovereign was a common\r\ncustom in Japan prior to the eighth century. In those early days the\r\nterm \"miyako,\" though used in the sense of \"metropolis,\" bore chiefly\r\nthe meaning \"Imperial residence,\" and to alter its locality did not\r\noriginally suggest a national effort. But when Kwammu ascended the\r\nthrone, Nara had been the capital during eight reigns, covering a\r\nperiod of seventy-five years, and had grown into a great city, a\r\ncentre alike of religion and of trade. To transfer it involved a\r\ncorrespondingly signal sacrifice. What was Kwammu's motive? Some have\r\nconjectured a desire to shake off the priestly influences which\r\npermeated the atmosphere of Nara; others, that he found the Yamato\r\ncity too small to satisfy his ambitious views or to suit the quickly\r\ndeveloping dimensions and prosperity of the nation. Probably both\r\nexplanations are correct. Looking back only a few years, a ruler of\r\nKwammu's sagacity must have appreciated that religious fanaticism, as\r\npractised at Nara, threatened to overshadow even the Imperial Court,\r\nand that the influence of the foreign creed tended to undermine the\r\nShinto cult, which constituted the main bulwark of the Throne.\r\n\r\n*Previously to becoming the metropolitan province, Yamashiro was\r\nwritten with ideographs signifying \"behind the mountain\" (yama no\r\nushiro), but these were afterwards changed to \"mountain castle\"\r\n(yamashiro).\r\n\r\nWe shall presently see how this latter danger was averted at Kyoto,\r\nand it certainly does not appear extravagant to credit Kwammu with\r\nhaving promoted that result. At all events, he was not tempted by the\r\nsuperior advantages of any other site in particular. In 784, when he\r\nadopted the resolve to found a new capital, it was necessary to\r\ndetermine the place by sending out a search party under his most\r\ntrusted minister, Fujiwara Tanetsugu. The choice of Tanetsugu fell,\r\nnot upon Kyoto, but upon Nagaoka in the same province. There was no\r\nhesitation. The Emperor trusted Tanetsugu implicitly and appointed\r\nhim chief commissioner of the building, which was commenced at once,\r\na decree being issued that all taxes for the year should be paid at\r\nNagaoka where also forced labourers were required to assemble and\r\nmaterials were collected. The Records state that the area of the site\r\nfor the new palace measured 152 acres, for which the owners received\r\ncompensation amounting to the equivalent of £2580 ($12,550); or an\r\naverage of £17 ($82) per acre. The number of people employed is put\r\nat 314,000,* and the fund appropriated, at 680,000 sheaves of rice,\r\nhaving a value of about £40,800 ($200,000) according to modern\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n*This does not mean that 314,000 persons were employed\r\nsimultaneously, but only that the number of workmen multiplied by the\r\nnumber of days of work equalled 314,000.\r\n\r\nThe palace was never finished. While it was still uncompleted, the\r\nEmperor took up his abode there, in the fall of 784, and efforts to\r\nhasten the work were redoubled. But a shocking incident occurred. The\r\nCrown Prince, Sagara, procured the elevation of a member of the Saeki\r\nfamily to the high post of State councillor (sangi), and having been\r\nimpeached for this unprecedented act by Fujiwara Tanetsugu, was\r\ndeprived of his title to the throne. Shortly afterwards, the Emperor\r\nrepaired to Nara, and during the absence of the Court from Nagaoka,\r\nPrince Sagara compassed the assassination of Tanetsugu. Kwammu\r\nexacted stern vengeance for his favourite minister. He disgraced the\r\nprince and sent him into exile in the island of Awaji, which place he\r\ndid not reach alive, as was perhaps designed.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: COURTYARD OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE, AT KYOTO\r\n\r\nThese occurrences moved the Emperor so profoundly that Nagaoka became\r\nintolerable to him. Gradually the work of building was abandoned,\r\nand, in 792, a new site was selected by Wake no Kiyomaro at Uda in\r\nthe same province. So many attractions were claimed for this village\r\nthat failure to choose it originally becomes difficult to understand.\r\nImperial decrees eulogized its mountains and rivers, and people\r\nrecalled a prediction uttered 170 years previously by Prince Shotoku\r\nthat the place would ultimately be selected for the perpetual capital\r\nof the empire. The Tang metropolis, Changan, was taken for model.\r\nCommenced in April, 794, the new metropolis was finished in December,\r\n805.\r\n\r\nThe city was laid out with mathematical exactness in the form of a\r\nrectangle, nearly three and one-half miles long, from north to south,\r\nand about three miles wide, from east to west. In each direction were\r\nnine principal thoroughfares, those running east and west crossing\r\nthe north and south streets at right angles. The east and west\r\nstreets were numbered from 1 to 9, and, although the regularity of\r\nstructure and plan of the city has been altered by fire and other\r\ncauses in eleven hundred years, traces of this early system of\r\nnomenclature are still found in the streets of Kyoto.* Running north\r\nfrom the centre of the south side was a great avenue, two hundred and\r\neighty feet wide, which divided the city into two parts, the eastern,\r\ncalled \"the left metropolis\" (later Tokyo, \"eastern capital\"), and\r\n\"the right metropolis\" (or Saikyo, \"western capital\"),--the left, as\r\nalways in Japan, having precedence over the right, and the direction\r\nbeing taken not from the southern entrance gate but from the Imperial\r\npalace, to which this great avenue led and which was on the northern\r\nlimits of the city and, as the reader will see, at the very centre of\r\nthe north wall. Grouped around the palace were government buildings\r\nof the different administrative departments and assembly and audience\r\nhalls.\r\n\r\n*The Kyoto of today is only a remnant of the ancient city; it was\r\nalmost wholly destroyed by fire in the Onin war of 1467.\r\n\r\nThe main streets, which have already been mentioned as connecting the\r\ngates in opposite walls, varied in width from 80 feet to 170 feet.\r\nThey divided the city into nine districts, all of the same area\r\nexcept the ones immediately east of the palace. The subdivisions were\r\nas formal and precise. Each of the nine districts contained four\r\ndivisions. Each division was made up of four streets. A street was\r\nmade up of four rows, each row containing eight \"house-units.\" The\r\nhouse-unit was 50 by 100 feet. The main streets in either direction\r\nwere crossed at regular intervals by lanes or minor streets, all\r\nmeeting at right angles.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial citadel in the north central part of the city was 4600\r\nfeet long (from north to south) and 3840 feet wide, and was\r\nsurrounded by a fence roofed with tiles and pierced with three gates\r\non either side. The palace was roofed with green tiles of Chinese\r\nmanufacture and a few private dwellings had roofs made of\r\nslate-coloured tiles, but most of them were shingled. In the earlier\r\nperiod, it is to be remembered, tiles were used almost exclusively\r\nfor temple roofs. The architecture of the new city was in general\r\nvery simple and unpretentious. The old canons of Shinto temple\r\narchitecture had some influence even in this city built on a Chinese\r\nmodel. Whatever display or ornament there was, appeared not on the\r\nexterior but in inner rooms, especially those giving on inner court\r\nyards. That these resources were severely taxed, however, cannot be\r\ndoubted, especially when we remember that the campaign against the\r\nYemishi was simultaneously conducted. History relates that\r\nthree-fifths of the national revenues were appropriated for the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nINTERCOURSE WITH CHINA AND BUDDHIST PROPAGANDISM\r\n\r\nThe fact that the metropolis at Changan was taken for model in\r\nbuilding Kyoto prepares us to find that intercourse with the Middle\r\nKingdom was frequent and intimate. But although China under the Tang\r\ndynasty in the ninth century presented many industrial, artistic, and\r\nsocial features of an inspiring and attractive nature, her\r\nadministrative methods had begun to fall into disorder, which\r\ndiscredited them in Japanese eyes. We find, therefore, that although\r\nrenowned religionists went from Japan during the reign of Kwammu and\r\nfamiliarized themselves thoroughly with the Tang civilization, they\r\ndid not, on their return, attempt to popularize the political system\r\nof China, but praised only her art, her literature, and certain forms\r\nand conceptions of Buddhism which they found at Changan.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PRIEST SAICHO, AFTERWARD KNOWN AS DENGYO DAISHI\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of these religionists were Saicho and\r\nKukai--immortalized under their posthumous names of Dengyo Daishi and\r\nKobo Daishi, respectively. The former went to Changan in the train of\r\nthe ambassador, Sugawara Kiyokimi, in 802, and the latter accompanied\r\nFujiwara Kuzunomaro, two years later. Saicho was specially sent to\r\nChina by his sovereign to study Buddhism, in order that, on his\r\nreturn, he might become lord-abbot of a monastery which his Majesty\r\nhad caused to be built on Hie-no-yama--subsequently known as\r\nHiei-zan--a hill on the northeast of the new palace in Kyoto. A\r\nJapanese superstition regarded the northeast as the \"Demon's Gate,\"\r\nwhere a barrier must be erected against the ingress of evil\r\ninfluences. Saicho also brought from China many religious books.\r\n\r\nDown to that time the Buddhist doctrine preached in Japan had been of\r\na very dispiriting nature. It taught that salvation could not be\r\nreached except by efforts continued through three immeasurable\r\nperiods of time. But Saicho acquired a new doctrine in China. From\r\nthe monastery of Tientai (Japanese, Tendai) he carried back to\r\nHiei-zan a creed founded on the \"Lotus of the Good Law\"--a creed that\r\nsalvation is at once attainable by a knowledge of the Buddha nature,\r\nand that such knowledge may be acquired by meditation and wisdom.\r\nThat was the basic conception, but it underwent some modification at\r\nJapanese hands. It became \"a system of Japanese eclecticism, fitting\r\nthe disciplinary and meditative methods of the Chinese sage to the\r\npre-existing foundations of earlier sects.\"* This is not the place to\r\ndiscuss details of religious doctrine, but the introduction of the\r\nTendai belief has historical importance. In the first place, it\r\nillustrates a fact which may be read between the lines of all\r\nJapanese annals, namely, that the Japanese are never blind borrowers\r\nfrom foreign systems: their habit is \"to adapt what they borrow so as\r\nto fit it to what they possess.\" In the second place, the Tendai\r\nsystem became the parent of nearly all the great sects subsequently\r\nborn in Japan. In the third place, the Buddhas of Contemplation, by\r\nwhose aid the meditation of absolute truth is rendered possible,\r\nsuggested the idea that they had frequently been incarnated for the\r\nwelfare of mankind, and from that theory it was but a short step to\r\nthe conviction that \"the ancient gods whom the Japanese worshipped\r\nare but manifestations of these same mystical beings, and that the\r\nBuddhist faith had come, not to destroy the native Shinto, but to\r\nembody It into a higher and more universal system. From that moment\r\nthe triumph of Buddhism was secured.\"** It is thus seen that the\r\nvisit of Saicho (Dengyo Daishi) to China at the beginning of the\r\nninth century and the introduction of the Tendai creed into Japan\r\nconstitute landmarks in Japanese history.\r\n\r\n*Developments of Japanese Buddhism, by the Rev. A. Lloyd. M. A.\r\n\r\n**The doctrines that the Shinto deities were incarnations of the\r\nBuddhas of Contemplation (Dhyani) had already been enunciated by\r\nGyogi but its general acceptance dates from the days of Dengyo\r\nDaishi. The doctrine was called honchi-suishaku.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PRIEST KOKAI, AFTERWARD KNOWN AS KOBO DAISHI\r\n\r\nKOBO DAISHI\r\n\r\nContemporary with and even greater in the eyes of his countrymen than\r\nDengyo Daishi, was Kobo Daishi (known as Kukai during his lifetime).\r\nHe, too, visited China as a student of Buddhism, especially to learn\r\nthe interpretation of a Sutra which had fallen into his hands in\r\nJapan, and on his return he founded the system of the True Word\r\n(Shingori), which has been practically identified with the Gnosticism\r\nof early Christian days. Kobo Daishi is the most famous of all\r\nJapanese Buddhist teachers; famous alike as a saint, as an artist,\r\nand as a calligraphist. His influence on the intellectual history of\r\nhis country was marked, for he not only founded a religious system\r\nwhich to this day has a multitude of disciples, but he is also said\r\nto have invented, or at any rate to have materially improved, the\r\nJapanese syllabary (hira-gana).\r\n\r\nTHE SUBSERVIENCE OF SHINTO\r\n\r\nThat the disciples of the Shinto cult so readily endorsed a doctrine\r\nwhich relegated their creed to a subordinate place has suggested\r\nvarious explanations, but the simplest is the most convincing,\r\nnamely, that Shinto possessed no intrinsic power to assert itself in\r\nthe presence of a religion like Buddhism. At no period has Shinto\r\nproduced a great propagandist. No Japanese sovereign ever thought of\r\nexchanging the tumultuous life of the Throne for the quiet of a\r\nShinto shrine, nor did Shinto ever become a vehicle for the\r\ntransmission of useful knowledge.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: OKUNO-IN (Kobo Daishi's shrine) AT MT. KOYASAN\r\n\r\nWith Buddhism, the record is very different. Many of its followers\r\nwere inspired by the prospect of using it as a stepping-stone to\r\npreferment rather than as a route to Nirvana. Official posts being\r\npractically monopolized by the aristocratic classes, those born in\r\nlowlier families found little opportunity to win honour and\r\nemoluments. But by embracing a religious career, a man might aspire\r\nto become an abbot or even a tutor to a prince or sovereign. Thus,\r\nlearned and clever youths flocked to the portals of the priesthood,\r\nand the Emperor Saga is said to have lamented that the Court nobility\r\npossessed few great and able men, whereas the cloisters abounded in\r\nthem. On the other hand, it has been observed with much reason that\r\nas troublers of the people the Buddhist priests were not far behind\r\nthe provincial governors. In fact, it fared with Buddhism as it\r\ncommonly fares with all human institutions--success begot abuses. The\r\nexample of Dokyo exercised a demoralizing influence. The tonsure\r\nbecame a means of escaping official exactions in the shape of taxes\r\nor forced labour, and the building of temples a device to acquire\r\nproperty and wealth as well as to evade fiscal burdens. Sometimes the\r\nBuddhist priests lent themselves to the deception of becoming nominal\r\nowners of large estates in order to enable the real owners to escape\r\ntaxation. Buddhism in Japan ultimately became a great militant power,\r\nready at all times to appeal to force.\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTY-FIRST SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR HEIJO (A.D. 806-809)\r\n\r\nHeijo, the fifty-first sovereign, was the eldest son of Kwammu. The\r\nlatter, warned by the distress that his own great expenditures on\r\naccount of the new capital had produced, and fully sensible of the\r\nabuses practised by the provincial officials, urged upon the Crown\r\nPrince the imperative necessity of retrenchment, and Heijo, on\r\nascending the throne, showed much resolution in discharging\r\nsuperfluous officials, curtailing all unneeded outlays, and\r\nsimplifying administrative procedure. But physical weakness--he was a\r\nconfirmed invalid--and the influence of an ambitious woman wrecked\r\nhis career. While still Crown Prince, he fixed his affections on\r\nKusu, daughter of Fujiwara Tanetsugu, who had been assassinated by\r\nPrince Sagara during Kwammu's reign, and when Heijo ascended the\r\nthrone, this lady's influence made itself felt within and without the\r\npalace, while her brother, Nakanari, a haughty, headstrong man,\r\ntrading on his relationship to her, usurped almost Imperial\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nHeijo's ill-health, however, compelled him to abdicate after a reign\r\nof only three years. He retired to the old palace at Nara, entrusting\r\nthe sceptre to his brother, Saga. This step was profoundly\r\ndisappointing to Kusu and her brother. The former aimed at becoming\r\nEmpress--she possessed only the title of consort--and Fujiwara\r\nNakanari looked for the post of prime minister. They persuaded the\r\nex-Emperor to intimate a desire of reascending the throne. Saga\r\nacquiesced and would have handed over the sceptre, but at the\r\neleventh hour, Heijo's conscientious scruples, or his prudence,\r\ncaused a delay, whereupon Kusu and her brother, becoming desperate,\r\npublicly proclaimed that Heijo wished to transfer the capital to\r\nNara. Before they could consummate this programme, however, Saga\r\nsecured the assistance of Tamuramaro, famous as the conqueror of the\r\nYemishi, and by his aid Fujiwara Nakanari was seized and thrown into\r\nprison, the lady Kusu being deprived of her rank as consort and\r\ncondemned to be banished from Court. Heijo might have bowed to\r\nNakanari's fate, but Kusu's sentence of degradation and exile\r\novertaxed his patience. He raised an army and attempted to move to\r\nthe eastern provinces. In Mino, his route was intercepted by a force\r\nunder Tamuramaro, and the ex-Emperor's troops being shattered, no\r\nrecourse offered except to retreat to Nara. Then the Jo-o (Heijo)\r\ntook the tonsure, and his consort Kusu committed suicide. Those who\r\nhad rallied to the ex-Emperor's standard were banished.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST JAPANESE THAT ENTERED INDIA\r\n\r\nWhen Heijo ceded the throne to Saga, the former's son, Takaoka, was\r\nnominated Crown Prince, though Saga had sons of his own. Evidently\r\nthat step was taken for the purpose of averting precisely such\r\nincidents as those subsequently precipitated by the conspiracy to\r\nrestore Heijo. Therefore on the day following Heijo's adoption of the\r\ntonsure, Takaoka was deprived of his rank.* Entering the priesthood,\r\nhe called himself Shinnyo, retired to Higashi-dera and studied the\r\ndoctrine of the True Word (Shingori). In 836, he proceeded to China\r\nto prosecute his religious researches, and ultimately made his way to\r\nIndia (in his eighty-first year), where he was killed by a tiger in\r\nthe district now known as the Laos States of Siam. This prince is\r\nbelieved to have been the first Japanese that travelled to India. His\r\nfather, the ex-Emperor Heijo, was a student of the same Buddhist\r\ndoctrine (Shingon) and received instruction in it from Kukai. Heijo\r\ndied in 824, at the age of fifty-one.\r\n\r\n*His family was struck off the roll of princes and given the uji of\r\nAriwara Asomi.\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTY-SECOND SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR SAGA (A.D. 810-823)\r\n\r\nIt is memorable in the history of the ninth century that three\r\nbrothers occupied the throne in succession, Heijo, Saga, and Junna.\r\nHeijo's abdication was certainly due in part to weak health, but his\r\nsubsequent career proves that this reason was not imperative. Saga,\r\nafter a most useful reign of thirteen years, stepped down frankly in\r\nfavour of his younger brother. There is no valid reason to endorse\r\nthe view of some historians that these acts of self-effacement were\r\ninspired by an indolent distaste for the cares of kingship. Neither\r\nHeijo nor Saga shrank from duty in any form. During his brief tenure\r\nof power the former unflinchingly effected reforms of the most\r\ndistasteful kind, as the dismissal of superfluous officials and the\r\ncurtailing of expenses; and the latter's reign was distinguished by\r\nmuch useful legislation and organization. Heijo's abdication seems to\r\nhave been due to genuine solicitude for the good of the State, and\r\nSaga's to a sense of reluctance to be outdone in magnanimity.\r\nReciprocity of moral obligation (giri) has been a canon of Japanese\r\nconduct in all ages.\r\n\r\nSANGI AND KURANDO\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest acts of Saga's reign was to establish the office\r\nof Court councillor (sangi) definitely and to determine the number of\r\nthese officials at eight. The post of sangi had been instituted more\r\nthan a century previously, but its occupants had neither fixed\r\nfunction, rank, nor number: they merely gave fortuitous advice about\r\npolitical affairs. Another office, dating from the same time (810),\r\nwas that of kurando (called also kurodo). This seems to have been\r\nmainly a product of the political situation. At the palace of the\r\nretired Emperor in Nara--the Inchu, as it was called--the ambitious\r\nFujiwara Nakanari and the Imperial consort, Kusu, were arrogating a\r\nlarge share of administrative and judicial business, and were\r\nflagrantly abusing their usurped authority. Saga did not know whom to\r\ntrust. He feared that the council of State (Dajo-kwan) might include\r\nsome traitors to his cause, and he therefore instituted a special\r\noffice to be the depository of all secret documents, to adjudicate\r\nsuits at law, to promulgate Imperial rescripts and decrees, to act as\r\na kind of palace cabinet, and to have charge of all supplies for the\r\nCourt. Ultimately this last function became the most important of the\r\nkurando's duties.\r\n\r\nKEBIISHI AND TSUIHOSHI\r\n\r\nIt has already been explained that the Daiho legislators, at the\r\nbeginning of the eighth century, having enacted a code (ryo) and a\r\npenal law (ritsu), supplemented these with a body of official rules\r\n(kyaku) and operative regulations (shiki). The necessity of revising\r\nthese rules and regulations was appreciated by the Emperor Kwammu,\r\nbut he did not live to witness the completion of the work, which he\r\nhad entrusted to the sa-daijin, Fujiwara Uchimaro, and others. The\r\ntask was therefore re-approached by a committee of which the\r\ndainagon, Fujiwara Fuyutsugu, was president, under orders from the\r\nEmperor Saga. Ten volumes of the rules and forty of the regulations\r\nwere issued in 819, the former being a collection of all rescripts\r\nand decrees issued since the first year of Daiho (701), and the\r\nlatter a synopsis of instructions given by various high officials and\r\nproved by practice since the same date. Here, then, was a\r\nsufficiently precise and comprehensive body of administrative guides.\r\nBut men competent to utilize them were not readily forthcoming. The\r\nprovincial governors and even the metropolitan officials, chosen from\r\namong men whose qualifications were generally limited to literary\r\nability or aristocratic influence, showed themselves incapable of\r\ndealing with the lawless conditions existing in their districts.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs had been noticeable ever since the reign of\r\nShomu (724-749), but not until the time of Saga was a remedy devised.\r\nIt took the form of organizing a body of men called kebiishi, upon\r\nwhom devolved the duty of pursuing and arresting lawbreakers. At\r\nfirst this measure was on a small scale and of a tentative character.\r\nBut its results proved so satisfactory that the system was extended\r\nfrom the capital to the provinces, and, in 830, a Kebiishi-cho (Board\r\nof Kebiishi) was duly formed, the number and duties of its staff\r\nbeing definitely fixed four years later. The importance attaching to\r\nthe post of chief of this board is attested by the fact that only the\r\nemon no Kami or the hyoye no Kami* was eligible originally, the bushi\r\n(military men) in the hereditary service of these high dignitaries\r\nbeing entrusted--under the name of tsuiho-shi--with the duty of\r\nenforcing the law against all violators. Ultimately the judicial\r\nfunctions hitherto discharged by the Efu (Guard Office), the\r\nDanjo-dai (Police Board) and the Gyobu-sho (Department of Justice)\r\nwere all transferred to the Kebiishi-cho, and the latter's orders\r\nranked next to Imperial decrees.\r\n\r\n*Three corps of military guards formed part of the organization. The\r\nsenior corps were the Imperial guards (konoe): then came the military\r\nguards (hyoye) and then the gate-guards (yemon). Each was divided\r\ninto two battalions; a battalion of the Left and a battalion of the\r\nRight. Then there were the sa-konye and the u-konye, the sa-hyoye and\r\nthe u-hyoye, the sa-yemon and the u-yemon. These six offices were\r\nknown as roku-yefu, and the officer in chief command of each corps\r\nwas a kami.\r\n\r\nThese kebiishi and tsuiho-shi have historical importance. They\r\nrepresent the unequivocal beginning of the military class which was\r\ndestined ultimately to impose its sway over the whole of Japan. Their\r\ninstitution was also a distinct step towards transferring the conduct\r\nof affairs, both military and civil, from the direct control of the\r\nsovereign to the hands of officialdom. The Emperor's power now began\r\nto cease to be initiative and to be limited to sanction or veto. The\r\nKurando-dokoro was the precursor of the kwampaku; the Kebiishi-cho,\r\nof the so-tsuihoshi.\r\n\r\nFUJIWARA FUYUTSUGU\r\n\r\nFujiwara Fuyutsugu, who, as mentioned above, took such an important\r\npart in the legislation of his era, may be adduced as illustrating\r\nthe error of the too common assertion that because the Fujiwara\r\nnobles abused their opportunities in the later centuries of the Heian\r\nepoch, the great family's services to its country were small.\r\nFujiwara Fuyutsugu was at once a statesman, a legislator, an\r\nhistorian, and a soldier. Serving the State loyally and assiduously,\r\nhe reached the rank of first minister (sa-daijiri) though he died at\r\nthe early age of fifty-two, and it is beyond question that to his\r\nability must be attributed a large measure of the success achieved by\r\nhis Imperial master, Saga. The story of his private life may be\r\ngathered from the fact that he established and richly endowed an\r\nasylum for the relief of his indigent relatives; a college (the\r\nKwangaku-iri) for the education of Fujiwara youths, and an uji-tera\r\n(Nanyen-do) at Nara for soliciting heaven's blessing on all that bore\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nTHE JAPANESE PEERAGE\r\n\r\nAn interesting episode of Saga's reign was the compilation of a\r\nrecord of all the uji (family names). Originally the right to use a\r\nfamily name had been guarded as carefully as is a title of nobility\r\nin Europe. The uji was, in truth, a hereditary title. But, as has\r\nbeen occasionally noted in these pages, an uji was from time to time\r\nbestowed on families of aliens, and thus, in the course of ages,\r\nconfusion gradually arose. From the middle of the eighth century,\r\nefforts to compile a trustworthy record were made, and in Kwammu's\r\nreign a genealogical bureau (kankei-jo) was actually organized, its\r\nlabours resulting in a catalogue of titles (seishi mokuroku). This\r\nproved defective, however, as did a subsequent effort in Heijo's\r\ntime. Finally, the Emperor Saga entrusted the task to Prince Mamta,\r\nwho, with a large staff of assistants, laboured for ten years, and,\r\nin 814, produced the Seishi-roku (Record of Uji) in thirty volumes.\r\nThough not absolutely exhaustive, this great work remained a classic\r\ndown to modern times. It divided into three classes the whole body of\r\nuji--1182--enrolled in its pages: namely, Kwobetsu, or those of\r\nImperial lineage; Shimbetsu, or those descended from the Kami, and\r\nBambetsu, or those of alien origin (Chinese or Korean). A few who\r\ncould not be clearly traced were placed in a \"miscellaneous list.\"\r\nThis paragraph of history suggests the quality of Japanese\r\ncivilization in the ninth century.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HYO-NO-MA ROOM IN THE KOHOAN OF DAITOKU-JI, AT KYOTO\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTY-THIRD SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR JUNNA (A.D. 824-833)\r\n\r\nJunna was Kwammu's third son. He ascended the throne on the\r\nabdication of his elder brother, Saga, and he himself abdicated in\r\nfavour of the latter's son, Nimmyo, nine years later. Junna's reign\r\nis not remarkable for any achievement. No special legislation was\r\ninaugurated nor any campaign against abuses undertaken. The three\r\nbrothers, Heijo, Saga, and Junna, may be said to have devoted\r\nparamount attention to the study of Chinese literature. History\r\nrefuses, however, to connect this industry with a desire for ethical\r\ninstruction. Their efforts are said to have been limited to the\r\ntracing of ideographs and the composition of verselets. A perfectly\r\nformed ideograph possesses in Japanese eyes many of the qualities\r\nthat commend a pictorial masterpiece to Western appreciation. Saga\r\nachieved the distinction of being reckoned among the \"Three Penmen\"\r\nof his era,* and he carried his enthusiasm so far as to require that\r\nall the scions of the aristocracy should be instructed in the Chinese\r\nclassics. Junna had less ability, but his admiration was not less\r\nprofound for a fine specimen of script or a deftly turned couplet. It\r\nis, nevertheless, difficult to believe that these enthusiasts\r\nconfined themselves to the superficialities of Chinese learning. The\r\nillustrations of altruism which they furnished by abdicating in one\r\nanother's favour may well have been inspired by perusing the writings\r\nof Confucius.** However that may be, the reign of Junna, though not\r\nsubjectively distinguished, forms a landmark in Japanese history as\r\nthe period which closed the independent exercise of sovereign\r\nauthority. When Junna laid down the sceptre, it may be said, as we\r\nshall presently see, to have been taken up by the Fujiwara.\r\n\r\n*The other two were Kobo Daishi, and Tachibana Hayanari.\r\n\r\n**Vide the remarks of the Chinese sage on Tai-pei, Chou-kung,\r\nWen-wang, and Wu-wang.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"SHAKUHACHI,\" FLUTES MADE OF BAMBOO\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"KARAMON\" GATE OF NISHI HONGWAN-JI TEMPLE, AT KYOTO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE HEIAN EPOCH (Continued)\r\n\r\n54th Sovereign, Nimmyo    A.D. 834-850\r\n\r\n55th     \"      Montoku        851-858\r\n\r\n56th     \"      Seiwa          859-876\r\n\r\n57th     \"      Yozei          877-884\r\n\r\n58th     \"      Koko           885-887\r\n\r\n59th     \"      Uda            888-897\r\n\r\n60th     \"      Daigo          898-930\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF FUJIWARA SUPREMACY\r\n\r\nTHE events that now occurred require to be prefaced by a table:\r\n\r\n           /\r\n           | Heijo\r\n           |\r\n           | Saga--Nimmyo (m.

The\r\nlatter was married to Jun, daughter of Fujiwara Fuyutsugu, and had a\r\nson, Prince Michiyasu. But, in consideration of the fact that Junna\r\nhad handed over the sceptre to Nimmyo, Nimmyo, in turn, set aside the\r\nclaim of his own son, Michiyasu, and conferred the dignity of Prince\r\nImperial on Prince Tsunesada, Junna's son. A double debt of gratitude\r\nwas thus paid, for Tsunesada was not only Junna's son but also Saga's\r\ngrandson, and thus the abdications of Saga and Junna were both\r\ncompensated. The new Prince Imperial, however, being a man of much\r\nsagacity, foresaw trouble if he consented to supplant Nimmyo's son.\r\nHe struggled to avoid the nomination, but finally yielded to the\r\nwishes of his father and his grandfather.\r\n\r\nWhile these two ex-Emperors lived, things moved smoothly, to all\r\nappearances. On their demise trouble arose immediately. The Fujiwara\r\nfamily perceived its opportunity and decided to profit by it.\r\nFujiwara Fuyutsugu had died, and it chanced that his son Yoshifusa\r\nwas a man of boundless ambition. By him and his partisans a slander\r\nwas framed to the effect that the Crown Prince, Tsunesada, harboured\r\nrebellious designs, and the Emperor, believing the story--having, it\r\nis said, a disposition to believe it--pronounced sentence of exile\r\nagainst Prince Tsunesada, as well as his friends, the celebrated\r\nscholar, Tachibana no Hayanari, and the able statesman, Tomo no\r\nKowamine, together with a number of others. It is recorded that the\r\nsympathy of the people was with the exiles.\r\n\r\nThese things happened in the year 843. The Fujiwara sought a\r\nprecedent in the action of their renowned ancestor, Momokawa, who, in\r\n772, contrived the degradation and death of the Crown Prince Osabe on\r\na charge of sorcery But Momokawa acted from motives of pure\r\npatriotism, whereas Yoshifusa worked in the Fujiwara interests only.\r\nThis, in fact, was the first step towards the transfer of\r\nadministrative power from the Throne to the Fujiwara.\r\n\r\nFRESH COMPLICATIONS ABOUT THE SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nAnother table may be consulted with advantage:\r\n\r\n                                                   \\\r\n   Emperor Heijo--Prince Aho--Ariwara no Narihira  |\r\n                                                    >\r\n                 /                                 |\r\n                 |            Aritsune--a daughter |\r\n                 |                                 /\r\n   Ki no Natora <                    \\\r\n                 | Shizu--a daughter  |\r\n                 \\                    |\r\n                                       > Prince Koretaka\r\n          Emperor Montoku             |\r\n                                      /\r\n                                                 \\\r\n                   Emperor Montoku               |\r\n                                                 |\r\n                      \\                           > Prince Korehito\r\n   Fujiwara Yoshifusa |                          |  (Emperor Seiwa)\r\n   Princess Kiyo       >  Aki (Empress Somedono) |\r\n   (daughter of Saga) |                          /\r\n                      /\r\n\r\nIn the year 851, the Emperor Montoku ascended the throne, and\r\nFujiwara Yoshifusa was appointed minister of the Right. Yoshifusa\r\nmarried Princess Kiyo, daughter of the Emperor Saga. She had been\r\ngiven the uji of Minamoto in order to legalize this union, and she\r\nbore to Yoshifusa a daughter who became Montoku's Empress under the\r\nname of Somedono. By her, Montoku had a son, Prince Korehito, whose\r\nchance of succeeding to the crown should have been very slender since\r\nhe had three half-brothers, the oldest of whom, Prince Koretaka, had\r\nalready attained his fourth year at the time of Korehito's birth, and\r\nwas his father's favourite. In fact, Montoku would certainly have\r\nnominated Koretaka to be Prince Imperial had he not feared to offend\r\nthe Fujiwara. These let it be seen very plainly what they designed.\r\nThe baby, Korehito, was taken from the palace into Yoshifusa's\r\nmansion, and when only nine months old was nominated Crown Prince.\r\nThe event enriched Japanese literature. For Montoku's first born,\r\nPrince Koretaka, seeing himself deprived of his birthright, went into\r\nseclusion in Ono at the foot of Mount Hiei, and there, in the shadow\r\nof the great Tendai monastery, devoted his days to composing\r\nverselets. In that pastime he was frequently joined by Ariwara no\r\nNarihira, who, as a grandson of the Emperor Heijo, possessed a title\r\nto the succession more valid than even that of the disappointed\r\nKoretaka. In the celebrated Japanese anthology, the Kokin-shu,\r\ncompiled at the beginning of the tenth century, there are found\r\nseveral couplets from the pens of Koretaka and Narihira.\r\n\r\nTHE FUJIWARA REGENCY\r\n\r\nIt was in the days of Fujiwara Yoshifusa that the descendants of\r\nKamatari first assumed the role of kingmakers. Yoshifusa obtained the\r\nposition of minister of the Right on the accession of Montoku (851),\r\nand, six years later, he was appointed chancellor of the empire (dajo\r\ndaijin) in the sequel of the intrigues which had procured for his own\r\ngrandson (Korehito) the nomination of Prince Imperial. The latter,\r\nknown in history as the Emperor Seiwa, ascended the throne in the\r\nyear 859. He was then a child of nine, and naturally the whole duty\r\nof administration devolved upon the chancellor. This situation fell\r\nshort of the Fujiwara leader's ideal in nomenclature only. There had\r\nbeen many \"chancellors\" but few \"regents\" (sessho). In fact, the\r\noffice of regent had always been practically confined to princes of\r\nthe Blood, and the qualifications for holding it were prescribed in\r\nvery high terms by the Daiho statutes. Yoshifusa did not possess any\r\nof the qualifications, but he wielded power sufficient to dispense\r\nwith them, and, in the year 866, he celebrated the Emperor's\r\nattainment of his majority by having himself named sessho. The\r\nappointment carried with it a sustenance fief of three thousand\r\nhouses; the privilege of being constantly attended by squadrons of\r\nthe Right and Left Imperial guards, and the honour of receiving the\r\nallowances and the treatment of the Sangu, that is to say, of an\r\nEmpress, a Dowager Empress, or a Grand Dowager Empress. Husband of an\r\nEmpress, father of an Empress Dowager, grandfather of a reigning\r\nEmperor, chancellor of the empire, and a regent--a subject could\r\nclimb no higher. Yoshifusa died in 872 at the age of sixty-eight.\r\nHaving no son of his own, he adopted his nephew, Mototsune, son of\r\nFujiwara Nagara.\r\n\r\nSEIWA'S EMPRESS\r\n\r\nSeiwa abdicated in 876, at the age of twenty-seven. Some historians\r\nascribe his abdication to a sentiment of remorse. He had ascended the\r\nthrone in despite of the superior claims of his elder brother,\r\nKoretaka, and the usurpation weighed heavily on his conscience. It is\r\nat least credible that since, in taking the sceptre he obeyed the\r\ndictates of the Fujiwara, so in laying it down he followed the same\r\nguidance. We cannot be sure as to the exact date when the great\r\nfamily's policy of boy-sovereigns first took definite shape, but the\r\nannals seem to show that Yoshifusa conceived the programme and that\r\nhis adopted son, Mototsune, carried it out. A halo rests on Seiwa's\r\nhead for the sake of his memorable descendants, the Minamoto chiefs,\r\nYoritomo, Takauji, and Ieyasu. Heaven is supposed to have compensated\r\nthe brevity of his own tenure of power by the overwhelming share that\r\nhis posterity enjoyed in the administration of the empire.\r\n\r\nBut Seiwa was undoubtedly a good man as well as a zealous sovereign.\r\nOne episode in his career deserves attention as illustrating the\r\ncustoms of the era. Mention has already been made of Ariwara no\r\nNarihira, a grandson of the Emperor Heijo and one of the most\r\nrenowned among Japanese poets. He was a man of singular beauty, and\r\nhis literary attainments, combined with the melancholy that marked\r\nhis life of ignored rights, made him a specially interesting figure.\r\nHe won the love of Taka, younger sister of Fujiwara Mototsune and\r\nniece of Yoshifusa. Their liaison was not hidden. But Yoshifusa, in\r\ndefault of a child of his own, was just then seeking some Fujiwara\r\nmaiden suitable to be the consort of the young Emperor, Seiwa, in\r\npursuance of the newly conceived policy of building the Fujiwara\r\npower on the influence of the ladies' apartments in the palace. Taka\r\npossessed all the necessary qualifications. In another age the\r\nobstacle of her blemished purity must have proved fatal. Yoshifusa's\r\naudacity, however, was as limitless as his authority. He ordered the\r\npoet prince to cut his hair and go eastward in expiation of the crime\r\nof seeking to win Taka's affections, and having thus officially\r\nrehabilitated her reputation, he introduced her into the household of\r\nthe Empress Dowager, his own daughter, through whose connivance the\r\nlady soon found her way to the young Emperor's chamber and became the\r\nmother of his successor, Yozei.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. Though only a Fujiwara, and a soiled Fujiwara at\r\nthat, Taka was subsequently raised to the rank of Empress.\r\nUltimately, when Empress Dowager, her name was coupled with that of\r\nthe priest Zenyu of Toko-ji, as the Empress Koken's had been with\r\nthat of Dokyo, a hundred years previously, and she suffered\r\ndeprivation of Imperial rank. As for Narihira, after a few years he\r\nwas allowed to return from exile, but finding that all his hopes of\r\npreferment were vain, he abandoned himself to a life of indolence and\r\ndebauchery. His name, however, will always stand next to those of\r\nHitomaro and Akahito on the roll of Japanese poets.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FUJIWARA SEIWA\r\n\r\nYOZEI, UDA, AND THE KWAMPAKU\r\n\r\nThe fifty-seventh sovereign was Yozei, offspring of the Emperor\r\nSeiwa's union with the lady Taka. He ascended the throne in the year\r\n877, at the age of ten, and Fujiwara Mototsune--Yoshifusa had died\r\nfive years previously--became regent (sessho), holding also the post\r\nof chancellor (dajo-daijin). When Yozei was approaching his\r\nseventeenth year he was overtaken by an illness which left him a\r\nlunatic. It is related that he behaved in an extraordinary manner. He\r\nset dogs and monkeys to fight and then slaughtered them; he fed toads\r\nto snakes, and finally compelling a man lo ascend a tree, he stabbed\r\nhim among the branches. The regent decided that he must be dethroned,\r\nand a council of State was convened to consider the matter. There had\r\nnever been an example of an act so sacrilegious as the deposition of\r\nan Emperor at the dictate of his subjects. The ministers hesitated.\r\nThen one of the Fujiwara magnates (Morokuzu) loudly proclaimed\r\nthat anyone dissenting from the chancellor's proposal would have\r\nto answer for his contumacy. Thereafter, no one hesitated--so\r\novershadowing was the power of the Fujiwara. When carried to a\r\nspecial palace--thenceforth called Yozei-in--and informed that he\r\nhad been dethroned for killing a man, the young Emperor burst into a\r\nflood of tears.\r\n\r\nNo hesitation was shown in appointing Yozei's successor. Prince\r\nTokiyasu, son of the Emperor Nimmyo, satisfied all the requirements.\r\nHis mother, a daughter of Fujiwara Tsugunawa, was Mototsune's\r\nmaternal aunt, and the Prince himself, already in his fifty-fifth\r\nyear, had a son, Sadami, who was married to the daughter of Fujiwara\r\nTakafuji, a close relation to Mototsune. There can be no doubt that\r\nthe latter had the whole programme in view when he proposed the\r\ndethronement of Yozei. Shortly after his accession, Prince\r\nTokiyasu--known in history as the Emperor Koko--fell ill, and at\r\nMototsune's instance the sovereign's third son (Sadami) was nominated\r\nPrince Imperial. He succeeded to the throne as Emperor Uda on the\r\ndeath of his father, which occurred (887) after a reign of two years.\r\n\r\nThis event saw fresh extension of the Fujiwara's power. Uda was\r\ntwenty-two years of age when he received the sceptre, but recognizing\r\nthat he owed his elevation to Mototsune's influence and that his\r\nprospects of a peaceful reign depended upon retaining the Fujiwara's\r\nfavour, his first act was to decree that the administration should be\r\ncarried on wholly by the chancellor, the latter merely reporting to\r\nthe Throne. This involved the exercise of power hitherto\r\nunprecedented. To meet the situation a new office had to be created,\r\nnamely, that of kwampaku. The actual duties of this post were those\r\nof regent to a sovereign who had attained his majority, whereas\r\nsessho signified regent to a minor. Hence the kwampaku was obviously\r\nthe more honourable office, since its incumbent officiated in lieu of\r\nan Emperor of mature years. Accordingly, the kwampaku--or mayor of\r\nthe palace, as the term is usually translated--took precedence of all\r\nother officials. A subject could rise no higher without ceasing to\r\nyield allegiance. As Mototsune was the first kwampaku, he has been\r\ncalled the most ambitious and the least scrupulous of the Fujiwara.\r\nBut Mototsune merely stood at the pinnacle of an edifice, to the\r\nbuilding of which many had contributed, and among those builders not\r\na few fully deserved all they achieved. The names of such members of\r\nthe Fujiwara family as Mimori, Otsugu, Yoshino, Sadanushi, Nagara,\r\nYoshisuke, and Yasunori, who wrought and ruled in the period from\r\nHeijo and Saga to Montoku and Seiwa, might justly stand high in any\r\nrecord.*\r\n\r\n*The office of Kwampaku was continued from the time of its creation,\r\n882, to 1868.\r\n\r\nTHE AKO INCIDENT\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Uda, as already stated, owed everything to the Fujiwara.\r\nHe himself did not possess even the claim of primogeniture, since he\r\nwas the third among several sons, and he had stepped out of the ranks\r\nof the Imperial princes by accepting a family name. His decree\r\nconferring administrative autocracy on Mototsune was thus a natural\r\nexpression of gratitude.\r\n\r\nYet this very document proved a source of serious trouble. It was\r\ndrafted by Tachibana Hiromi, a ripe scholar, whose family stood as\r\nhigh on the aristocratic roll as did that of the Fujiwara themselves.\r\nAt that time literary attainments conferred immense prestige in\r\nKyoto. To be skilled in calligraphy; to be well versed in the\r\nclassics; to be capable of composing a sonorous decree or devising a\r\ngraceful couplet--such accomplishments constituted a passport not\r\nonly to high office but even to the love of women. Tachibana Hiromi\r\nwas one of the leading literati of his era. He rendered into most\r\nacademical terms the Emperor's intentions towards Mototsune. From\r\ntime immemorial it has always been a canon of Japanese etiquette not\r\nto receive anything with avidity. Mototsune declined the rescript;\r\nthe Emperor directed Hiromi to re-write it. Thus far the procedure\r\nhad been normal. But Hiromi's second draft ran thus: \"You have toiled\r\nfor the welfare of the country. You have aided me in accordance with\r\nthe late sovereign's will. You are the chief servant of the empire,\r\nnot my vassal. You will henceforth discharge the duties of ako.\" This\r\nterm \"ako\" occurs in Chinese history. It signifies \"reliance on\r\nequity,\" a name given by an early Emperor to the administration of\r\nthe sage, I Yin. Hiromi inserted it solely to impart a classical\r\nflavour to the decree and in all good faith.\r\n\r\nBut Fujiwara Sukeyo, a rival literatus who possessed the confidence\r\nof Mototsune, persuaded the latter that the epithet \"ako\" could not\r\napply to the discharge of active duties. What followed was\r\ncharacteristic. Mototsune caused a number of horses to be let loose\r\nin the city, his explanation being that, as he had no official\r\nfunctions to discharge, neither had he any need of horses. Naturally\r\na number of horses running wild in the streets of the capital caused\r\nconfusion which soon came to the notice of the palace. The Emperor at\r\nonce convoked a meeting of literati to discuss the matter, but these\r\nhesitated so long between their scholarly convictions and their\r\npolitical apprehensions that, for several months, a state of\r\nadministrative anarchy prevailed, and the Emperor recorded in his\r\ndiary a lament over the corruption of the age. At last, by the advice\r\nof the minister of the Left, Minamoto Toru, his Majesty sacrificed\r\nHiromi. A third decree was drafted, laying the blame on Hiromi's\r\nshoulders, and Mototsune graciously consented to resume the duties of\r\nthe first subject in the empire. Just forty-five years previously,\r\nHayanari, another illustrious scholar of the Tachibana family, had\r\nbeen among the victims of the false charge preferred against the\r\nCrown Prince, Tsunesada, by the Fujiwara partisans. Mototsune may\r\nwell have been desirous of removing from the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof the throne the representative of a family having such a cause of\r\numbrage against the Fujiwara.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is only just to note that he found ready\r\ncoadjutors among the jealous schoolmen of the time. Rival colleges,\r\nrival academies, and rival literati quarrelled with all the rancour\r\nof medieval Europe. The great luminaries of the era were Sugawara\r\nMichizane, Ki no Haseo, Koze no Fumio, Miyoshi Kiyotsura, and\r\nTachibana Hiromi. There was little mutual recognition of talent.\r\nKiyotsura abused Haseo as a pundit inferior to any of his\r\npredecessors. Michizane ridiculed Fumio's panegyric of Kiyotsura, The\r\npupils of these men endorsed their teachers' verdicts. Ajnong them\r\nall, Tachibana Hiromi occupied the most important position until the\r\nday of his downfall. He practically managed the affairs of the Court\r\nunder Yozei, Koko, and Uda. Fujiwara Sukeyo, a greatly inferior\r\nscholar, served as his subordinate, and was the willing tool in\r\ncontriving his degradation. It did not cause the Fujiwara any serious\r\nconcern that in compassing the ruin of Hiromi, they effectually\r\nalienated the sympathies of the sovereign.\r\n\r\nCESSATION OF EMBASSIES TO CHINA\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that in an era when Chinese literati attracted so\r\nmuch attention, visits to the Middle Kingdom were frequent. But from\r\nthe closing years of the eighth century, the great Tang dynasty began\r\nto fall into disorder, and the embassies sent from Japan reported a\r\ndiscouraging state of affairs. The last of these embassies\r\n(kento-shi) was in the year 838. It had long ceased to take the\r\noverland route via Liaoyang; the envoys' vessels were obliged to go\r\nby long sea, and the dangers were so great that to be named for this\r\nduty was regarded with consternation. In Uda's reign a project was\r\nformed to appoint Sugawara Michizane as kento-shi, and Ki no Haseo as\r\nhis lieutenant. There is reason to think that this suggestion came\r\nfrom Michizane's enemies who wished to remove him from a scene where\r\nhis presence threatened to become embarrassing. The course Michizane\r\nadopted at this crisis showed moral courage, whatever may be thought\r\nof its expediency. He memorialized the Throne in the sense that the\r\ndangers of the journey were not compensated by its results. The\r\nmemorial was approved. Since the days of the Empress Suiko, when the\r\nfirst kento-shi was despatched by Prince Shotoku, 294 years had\r\nelapsed, and by some critics the abandonment of the custom has been\r\ncondemned. But it is certain that China in the ninth century had\r\nlittle to teach Japan in the matter of either material or moral\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nTHE AFFAIR OF THE ENGI ERA\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Uda not only possessed great literary knowledge but was\r\nalso deeply sensible of the abuse that had grown out of the virtual\r\nusurpation of administrative authority by one family. As illustrating\r\nhis desire to extend the circle of the Throne's servants and to\r\nenlist erudite men into the service of the State, it is recorded that\r\nhe caused the interior of the palace to be decorated* with portraits\r\nof renowned statesmen and literati from the annals of China. Fate\r\nseemed disposed to assist his design, for, in the year 891, the\r\nall-powerful Fujiwara Mototsune died, leaving three sons, Tokihira,\r\nNakahira, and Tadahira, the eldest of whom was only twenty-one.\r\nDuring the life of Mototsune, to whom the Emperor owed everything, it\r\nwould not have been politically or morally possible to contrive any\r\nradical change of system, and even after his death, the Fujiwara\r\nfamily's claim to the Throne's gratitude precluded any direct attempt\r\non Uda's part to supplant them. Therefore, he formed the plan of\r\nabdicating in favour of his son, as soon as the latter should attain\r\na suitable age--a plan inspired in some degree by his own feeble\r\nhealth and by a keen desire to pass the closing years of his life in\r\ncomparative retirement. He carried out this design in the year 897,\r\nand was thenceforth known as Uda-in.**\r\n\r\n*It is on this occasion that we hear of Koze no Kanaoka, the first\r\nJapanese artist of great repute.\r\n\r\n**The suffix in was now first used for the names of retired Emperors.\r\n\r\nHis son, Daigo, who now ascended the throne, was thirteen years old,\r\nbut no Fujiwara regent was appointed, Tokihira, the one person\r\neligible in respect of lineage, being precluded by youth. Therefore\r\nthe office of minister of the Left was conferred on Tokihira, and\r\nSugawara Michizane (called also Kwanko) became minister of the Right.\r\n\r\nIt was to this Michizane that the ex-Emperor looked for material\r\nassistance in the prosecution of his design. The Sugawara family\r\ntraced its descent to Nomi no Sukune, the champion wrestler of the\r\nlast century before Christ and the originator of clay substitutes for\r\nhuman sacrifices at burials, though the name \"Sugawara\" did not\r\nbelong to the family until eight hundred years later, when the\r\nEmperor Konin bestowed it on the then representative in recognition\r\nof his great scholarship. Thenceforth, the name was borne by a\r\nsuccession of renowned literati, the most erudite and the most famous\r\nof all being Michizane.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Emperor, on the accession of his thirteen-year-old son, Daigo,\r\nhanded to the latter an autograph document known in history as the\r\nCounsels of the Kwampei Era. Its gist was: \"Be just. Do not be swayed\r\nby love or hate. Study to think impartially. Control your emotion and\r\nnever let it be externally visible. The sa-daijin, Fujiwara Tokihira,\r\nis the descendant of meritorious servants of the Crown. Though still\r\nyoung, he is already well versed in the administration of State\r\naffairs. Some years ago, he sinned with a woman,* but I have no\r\nlonger any memory of the event. You will consult him and be guided by\r\nhis counsels. The u-daijin, Sugawara Michizane, is a man of profound\r\nliterary knowledge. He is also acquainted with politics. Frequently I\r\nhave profited by his admonitions. When I was elected Crown Prince I\r\nhad but Michizane to advise me. Not only has he been a loyal servant\r\nto me, but he will be a loyal servant to my successor also.\" Plainly\r\nthe intention of the document was to place Michizane on a footing at\r\nleast equal to that of Tokihira. Michizane understood the perils of\r\nsuch preferment. He knew that the scion of a comparatively obscure\r\nfamily would not be tolerated as a rival by the Fujiwara. Three times\r\nhe declined the high post offered to him. In his second refusal he\r\ncompared himself to a man walking on thin ice, and in the third he\r\nsaid: \"If I myself am astounded at my promotion, how must others\r\nregard it? The end will come like a flash of lightning.\" But the\r\nEmperor and the ex-Emperor had laid their plans, and Michizane was an\r\nindispensable factor.\r\n\r\n*A liaison with his uncle's wife.\r\n\r\nEvents moved rapidly. Two years later (900), the Emperor, in concert\r\nwith the cloistered sovereign, proposed to raise Michizane to the\r\npost of chancellor and to entrust the whole administration to him.\r\nThis was the signal for the Fujiwara to take action. One opportunity\r\nfor slandering Michizane offered; his daughter had been married to\r\nPrince Tokiyo, the Emperor's younger brother. A rumour was busily\r\ncirculated that this meant a plot for the dethronement of Daigo in\r\nfavour of Tokiyo. Miyoshi Kiyotsura, an eminent scholar, acting\r\nsubtly at the instance of the Fujiwara, addressed a seemingly\r\nfriendly letter to Michizane, warning him that his career had become\r\ndangerously rapid and explaining that the stars presaged a revolution\r\nin the following year. At the same time, Minamoto Hikaru, son of the\r\nEmperor Nimmyo; Fujiwara Sadakuni, father-in-law of Daigo, and\r\nseveral others who were jealous of Michizane's preferment or of his\r\nscholarship, separately or jointly memorialized the Throne,\r\nimpeaching Michizane as a traitor who plotted against his sovereign.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SUGAWARA MICHIZANE\r\n\r\nSupplemented by Miyoshi's \"friendly\" notice of a star-predicated\r\ncataclysm, this cumulative evidence convinced, and doubtless the\r\nnumber and rank of the accusers alarmed the Emperor, then only in his\r\nseventeenth year. Michizane was not invited to defend himself. In the\r\nfirst year (901) of the Engi era, a decree went out stripping him of\r\nall his high offices, and banishing him to Dazai-fu in Kyushu as\r\nvice-governor. Many other officials were degraded as his partisans.\r\nThe ex-Emperor, to whose pity he pleaded in a plaintive couplet, made\r\na resolute attempt to aid him. His Majesty repaired to the palace for\r\nthe purpose of remonstrating with his son, Daigo. Had a meeting taken\r\nplace, Michizane's innocence would doubtless have been established.\r\nBut the Fujiwara had provided against such an obvious miscarriage of\r\ntheir design. The palace guards refused to admit the ex-Emperor, and,\r\nafter waiting throughout a winter's day seated on a straw mat before\r\nthe gate, Uda went away in the evening, sorehearted and profoundly\r\nhumiliated. Michizane's twenty-three children were banished to five\r\nplaces, and he himself, having only a nominal post, did not receive\r\nemoluments sufficient to support him in comfort. Even oil for a\r\nnight-lamp was often unprocurable, and after spending twenty-five\r\nmonths in voluntary confinement with only the society of his sorrows,\r\nhe expired (903) at the age of fifty-eight, and was buried in the\r\ntemple Anraku-ji in Chikuzen.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SHRINE OF SUGAWARA MICHIZANE AT KITANO, KYOTO\r\n\r\nNo figure in Japanese history has received such an abundant share of\r\nnational sympathy. His unjust fate and the idea that he suffered for\r\nhis sovereign appealed powerfully to popular imagination. Moreover,\r\nlightning struck the palace in Kyoto, and the three principal\r\ncontrivers of Michizane's disgrace, Fujiwara Tokihira, Fujiwara\r\nSugane, and Minamoto Hikaru, all expired within a few years'\r\ninterval. At that epoch a wide-spread belief existed in the powers of\r\ndisembodied spirits for evil or for good. Such a creed grew logically\r\nout of the cult of ancestor worship. It began to be whispered abroad\r\nthat Michizane's spirit was taking vengeance upon his enemies. The\r\nEmperor was the first to act upon this superstition. He restored\r\nMichizane's titles, raised him to the first grade of the second rank,\r\nand caused all the documents relating to his exile to be burned.\r\nRetribution did not stop there. Forty-five years after Michizane's\r\ndeath, the people of Kyoto erected to his memory the shrine of Temman\r\nTenjin,* and in the year 1004, the Emperor Ichijo not only conferred\r\non him the posthumous office of chancellor with the unprecedented\r\nhonour of first grade of the first rank, but also repaired in person\r\nto worship at the shrine. In later times, memorial shrines were built\r\nin various places, and to this day he is fervently worshipped as the\r\ndeity of calligraphy, so high was he elevated by the Fujiwara's\r\nattempt to drag him down.\r\n\r\n*Michizane was apotheosized under the name of Tenjin. He is known\r\nalso as Kan Shojo, and Temmangu.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SAMISEN (A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SANJU-SANGEN-DO TEMPLE AT KYOTO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE HEIAN EPOCH (Continued)\r\n\r\n60th Sovereign, Daigo (Continued)\r\n61st    \"       Emperor Shujaku    A.D. 931-946\r\n\r\nTHE ENGI ERA (A.D. 901-923)\r\n\r\nIn the year 909, Fujiwara Tokihira died and was followed to the\r\ngrave, in 913, by Minamoto Hikaru. For an interval of some years no\r\nminister of State was nominated; the Emperor Daigo himself\r\nadministered affairs. For this interregnum in the sway of the\r\nFujiwara, the Engi era is memorable.\r\n\r\nIt is memorable for other things also; notably for the compilation of\r\ndocuments which throw much light on the conditions then existing in\r\nJapan. The Emperor, in 914, called upon the Court officials to submit\r\nmemorials which should supply materials for administrative reforms.\r\nThe great scholar, Miyoshi Kiyotsura, responded with ability so\r\nconspicuous that posterity has been disposed to question the justice\r\nof the charges against him in connexion with Michizane's fate. He set\r\nout by stating that, in the early times, the national sentiment had\r\nbeen kind and simple; the people loyal to the Throne and obedient to\r\nparents; the taxes moderate. But, thereafter, customs had gradually\r\ndeteriorated. Laws and regulations were promulgated with bewildering\r\nrapidity. Taxes and forced labour grew heavier day by day. Cultivated\r\nlands were suffered to lie fallow. Buddhism established such a hold\r\nupon men's minds that people of all classes impoverished themselves\r\nto build places of worship and to cast images. Upon the erection of\r\nthe provincial temples (Kokubun-ji) five-tenths of the national taxes\r\nwere expended; and in connexion with the removal of the capital to\r\nKyoto and the building of new palaces, a further sum of three-tenths\r\nwas paid out. Again, the Emperor Nimmyo's (834-850) love of luxury\r\nand display led to architectural extravagance entirely unprecedented,\r\nand involved the squandering of yet another tenth of the remaining\r\nincome of the State. Thereafter, in the Jokwan era (859-876),\r\nfrequent conflagrations destroyed the Imperial edifice, and its\r\nrestoration cost a tenth of the remaining revenue, so that only\r\none-twentieth was ultimately available for general expenses.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the state of the rural regions, the memorialist\r\ninstanced the case of Bitchu, a province on the Inland Sea, where he\r\nheld an official appointment in the year 893. The local records\r\n(Fudoki) showed that a levy made there about the middle of the\r\nseventh century had produced twenty thousand able-bodied soldiers,*\r\nwhereas a century later, there were found only nineteen hundred; yet\r\nanother century afterwards, only seventy; at the close of the ninth\r\ncentury, nine, and in the year 911, not one. To such a state of\r\ndesolation had the district been reduced in the space of 250 years,\r\nand its story might be taken as typical.\r\n\r\n*The district was consequently named Nima, an abbreviation of ni\r\n(two) man (ten thousand).\r\n\r\nPassing to the question of religion, the memorialist declared that\r\nthe Shinto ceremonials to secure good harvests had lost all\r\nsincerity. The officials behaved as though there were no such thing\r\nas deities. They used the offerings for their own private purposes,\r\nsold the sacred horses, and recited the rituals without the least\r\nshow of reverence. As for Buddhist priests, before asking them to\r\npray for the welfare of their parishioners, they must be asked to\r\npurge themselves of their own sins. The priests who ministered at the\r\nprovincial temples had lost all sense of shame. They had wives, built\r\nhouses, cultivated lands, and engaged in trade. Was it to be supposed\r\nthat heaven would hearken to the intervention of such sinners?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, luxury and extravagance had reached an extreme degree. On\r\none suit of clothes a patrimony was expended, and sometimes a year's\r\nincome barely sufficed for a single banquet. At funeral services all\r\nclasses launched into flagrant excesses. Feasts were prepared on such\r\na scale that the trays of viands covered the entire floor of a\r\ntemple. Thousands of pieces of gold were paid to the officiating\r\npriests, and a ceremony, begun in mourning, ended in revelry.\r\nCorresponding disorder existed with regard to the land. The original\r\ndistribution into kubunden, as we saw, had been partly for purposes\r\nof taxation. But now these allotments were illegally appropriated, so\r\nthat they neither paid imposts nor furnished labourers; and while\r\ngovernors held worthless regions, wealthy magnates annexed great\r\ntracts of fertile land. Another abuse, prevalent according to Miyoshi\r\nKiyotsura's testimony, was that accusations were falsely preferred by\r\nofficials against their seniors. Provincial governors were said to\r\nhave frequently indulged in this treacherous practice and to have\r\nbeen themselves at times the victims of similar attacks. The Court,\r\non receipt of such charges, seldom scrutinized them closely, but at\r\nonce despatched officers to deal with the incriminated persons, and\r\nin the sequel, men occupying exalted positions were obliged to plead\r\non an equal footing with officials of low grade or even common\r\npeople. Self-respecting persons chose to stand aside altogether from\r\nofficial life rather than to encounter such risks.\r\n\r\nThis was an almost inevitable result of the exceptional facilities\r\ngiven to petitioners under the Daika and Daiho systems. Miyoshi\r\nKiyotsura urged that all petitioning and all resulting inquiries by\r\nspecially appointed officials should be interdicted, except in\r\nmatters relating to political crime, and that all offenders should be\r\nhanded over to the duly constituted administrators of justice. As to\r\nthese latter, he spoke very plainly. The kebiishi, he wrote, who,\r\nbeing appointed to the various provinces, have to preserve law and\r\norder within their jurisdictions, should be men specially versed in\r\nlaw, whereas a majority of those serving in that capacity are\r\nignorant and incompetent persons who have purchased their offices. To\r\nillustrate further the want of discrimination shown in selecting\r\nofficials, he refers to the experts appointed in the maritime\r\nprovinces for manufacturing catapults, and declares that many of\r\nthese so-called \"experts\" had never seen a catapult.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FAMILY LIFE OF NOBLES, HEIAN EPOCH, A.D. 782-1192\r\n\r\nIt is against the Buddhist priests and the soldiers of the six guards\r\nthat he inveighs most vehemently, however. He calls them \"vicious and\r\nferocious,\" Those who take the tonsure, he says, number from two to\r\nthree thousand yearly, and about one-half of that total are wicked\r\nmen--low fellows who, desiring to evade taxation and forced labour,\r\nhave shaved their heads and donned priests vestments, aggregate\r\ntwo-thirds of the population. They marry, eat animal food, practise\r\nrobbery, and carry on coining operations without any fear of\r\npunishment. If a provincial governor attempts to restrain them, they\r\nflock together and have recourse to violence. It was by bandits under\r\nthe command of wicked priests that Fujiwara Tokiyoshi, governor of\r\nAki, and Tachibana Kinkado, governor of Kii, were waylaid and\r\nplundered.\r\n\r\nAs for the soldiers of the guards, instead of taking their monthly\r\nterm of duty at the palace, they are scattered over the country, and\r\nbeing strong and audacious, they treat the people violently and the\r\nprovincial governors with contumacy, sometimes even forming leagues\r\nto rob the latter and escaping to the capital when they are hard\r\npressed. (These guardsmen had arms and horses of their own and called\r\nthemselves bushi, a term destined to have wide vogue in Japan.) It is\r\ninteresting to note that they make their historical debut thus\r\nunfavourably introduced. Miyoshi Kiyotsura says that instead of being\r\n\"metropolitan tigers\" to guard the palace, they were \"rural wolves\"\r\nto despoil the provinces.\r\n\r\nAPPRECIATIONS OF THE MIYOSHI MEMORIAL\r\n\r\nThis celebrated document consisted of twelve articles and contained\r\nfive thousand ideographs, so that nothing was wanting in the matter\r\nof voluminousness. The writer did not confine himself to enumerating\r\nabuses: he also suggested remedies. Thus he urged that no man, having\r\nbecome an equerry (toneri) of the six corps of guards, should be\r\nallowed to return to his province during his term of service; that\r\nthe spurious priests should be all unfrocked and punished; that the\r\noffice of kebiishi should be restricted to men having legal\r\nknowledge; that the upper classes should set an example of economy in\r\ncostumes and observances; that the ranks of the Buddhist priesthood\r\nshould be purged of open violators of the laws of their creed, and so\r\nforth. Historians have justly eulogized the courage of a memorialist\r\nwho thus openly attacked wide-spread and powerful abuses. But they\r\nhave also noted that the document shows some reservations. For\r\ngenerations the Fujiwara family had virtually usurped the governing\r\npower; had dethroned Emperors and chosen Empresses; had consulted\r\ntheir own will alone in the administrations of justice and in the\r\nappointment and removal of officials. Yet of these things Miyoshi\r\nKiyotsura says nothing whatever. The sole hope of their redress lay\r\nin Michizane; but instead of supporting that ill-starred statesman,\r\nMiyoshi had contributed to his downfall. Could a reformer with such a\r\nrecord be regarded as altogether sincere?\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF THE EMPEROR DAIGO\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Daigo, who ruled thirty-two years--from 898 to 930--is\r\nbrought very close to us by the statement of a contemporary historian\r\nthat he was \"wise, intelligent, and kind-hearted,\" and that he always\r\nwore a smiling face, his own explanation of the latter habit being\r\nthat he found it much easier to converse with men familiarly than\r\nsolemnly. A celebrated incident of his career is that one winter's\r\nnight he took off his wadded silk garment to evince sympathy with the\r\npoor who possessed no such protection against the cold. Partly\r\nbecause of his debonair manner and charitable impulses he is\r\npopularly remembered as \"the wise Emperor of the Engi era.\" But close\r\nreaders of the annals do not fully endorse that tribute. They note\r\nthat Daigo's treatment of his father, Uda, on the celebrated occasion\r\nof the latter's visit to the palace to intercede for Michizane, was\r\nmarkedly unfilial; that his Majesty believed and acted upon slanders\r\nwhich touched the honour of his father no less than that of his\r\nwell-proved servant, and that he made no resolute effort to correct\r\nthe abuses of his time, even when they had been clearly pointed out\r\nby Miyoshi Kiyotsura. The usurpations of the Fujiwara; the\r\nprostitution of Buddhism to evil ends; the growth of luxurious and\r\ndissipated habits, and the subordination of practical ability to\r\npedantic scholarship--these four malignant growths upon the national\r\nlife found no healing treatment at Daigo's hands.\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSICAL AGE OF LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe Engi era and the intervals of three or four decades before and\r\nafter it may be regarded as the classical age of literature in Japan.\r\nProse composition of a certain class was wholly in Chinese. All works\r\nof a historical, scientific, legal, or theological nature were in\r\nthat language, and it cannot be said that they reached a very high\r\nlevel. Yet their authors had much honour. During the reigns of Uda\r\nand Daigo (888-930), Sugawara Michizane, Miyoshi Kiyotsura, Ki no\r\nHaseo, and Koze no Fumio, formed a quartet of famous masters of\r\nChinese literature. From one point of view, Michizane's overthrow by\r\nFujiwara Tokihira may be regarded as a collision between the\r\nConfucian doctrines which informed the polity of the Daika epoch and\r\nthe power of aristocratic heredity. Kibi no Makibi and Sugawara no\r\nMichizane were the only two Japanese subjects that attained to be\r\nministers of State solely in recognition of their learning, but\r\nseveral littérateurs reached high office, as chief chamberlain,\r\ncouncillor of State, minister of Education, and so forth. Miyoshi\r\nKiyotsura ranks next to Michizane among the scholars of that age. He\r\nwas profoundly versed in jurisprudence, mathematics (such as they\r\nwere at the time), the Chinese classics, and history. But whereas\r\nMichizane bequeathed to posterity ten volumes of poems and two\r\nhundred volumes of a valuable historical work, no production of\r\nKiyotsura's pen has survived except his celebrated memorial referred\r\nto above. He received the post of minister of the Household in 917\r\nand died in the following year.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the work of these scholars appealed to\r\nonly a very limited number of their countrymen. The ako incident (pp.\r\n239-240) illustrates this; the rescript penned by Tachibana no Hiromi\r\nwas not clearly comprehended outside a narrow circle of scholars.\r\nOfficial notices and enactments were intelligible by few men of the\r\ntrading classes and by no women. But a different record is found in\r\nthe realm of high literature. Here there is much wealth. The Nara\r\nepoch gave to Japan the famous Manyo-shu (Myriad Leaves), and the\r\nEngi era gave her the scarcely less celebrated Kokin-shu, an\r\nanthology of over eleven hundred poems, ancient and modern. As\r\nbetween the two books, the advantage is with the former, though not\r\nby any means in a marked degree, but in the abundance and excellence\r\nof its prose writings--pure Japanese writings apart from the Chinese\r\nworks referred to above--\"the Heian epoch leaves the Nara far behind.\r\nThe language had now attained to its full development. With its rich\r\nsystem of terminations and particles it was a pliant instrument in\r\nthe writer's hands, and the vocabulary was varied and copious to a\r\ndegree which is astonishing when we remember that it was drawn almost\r\nexclusively from native sources. The few words of Chinese origin\r\nwhich it contains seem to have found their way in through the spoken\r\nlanguage and are not taken straight from Chinese books, as at a later\r\nstage when Japanese authors loaded their periods with alien\r\nvocables.\"\r\n\r\nThis Heian literature \"reflects the pleasure-loving and effeminate,\r\nbut cultured and refined, character of the class of Japanese who\r\nproduced it. It has no serious masculine qualities and may be\r\ndescribed in one word as belles-lettres--poetry, fiction, diaries,\r\nand essays of a desultory kind. The lower classes of the people had\r\nno share in the literary activity of the time. Culture had not as yet\r\npenetrated beyond a very narrow circle. Both writers and readers\r\nbelonged exclusively to the official caste. It is remarkable that a\r\nvery large and important part of the best literature which Japan has\r\nproduced was written by women. A good share of the Nara poetry is of\r\nfeminine authorship, and, in the Heian period, women took a still\r\nmore conspicuous part in maintaining the honour of the native\r\nliterature. The two greatest works which have come down from Heian\r\ntime are both by women.* This was no doubt partly due to the\r\nabsorption of the masculine intellect in Chinese studies. But there\r\nwas a still more effective cause. The position of women in ancient\r\nJapan was very different from what it afterwards became when Chinese\r\nideals were in the ascendant. The Japanese of this early period did\r\nnot share the feeling common to most Eastern countries that women\r\nshould be kept in subjection and as far as possible in seclusion.\r\nThough the morality which the Heian literature reveals is anything\r\nbut strait-laced, the language is uniformly refined and decent, in\r\nthis respect resembling the best literature of China.\"**\r\n\r\n*The Genji Monogatari by Murasaki Shikibu, and the Makura Soshi by\r\nSei Shonagon.\r\n\r\n**Japanese Literature, by W. G. Aston.\r\n\r\nWith the Heian epoch is connected the wide use of the phonetic script\r\nknown as kana, which may be described as a syllabary of forty-seven\r\nsymbols formed from abbreviated Chinese ideographs. There are two\r\nvarieties of the kana--the kata-kana and the hiragana* The former is\r\nsaid to have been devised by Makibi, the latter by Kobo Daishi\r\n(Kukai), but doubts have been cast on the accuracy of that record,\r\nand nothing can be certainly affirmed except that both were known\r\nbefore the close of the ninth century, though they do not seem to\r\nhave been largely used until the Heian epoch, and even then almost\r\nentirely by women.\r\n\r\n*Katakana means \"side kana\" because its symbols are fragments (sides)\r\nof Chinese forms of whole ideographs.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MURASAKI SHIKIBU (COURT LADY AND POETESS)\r\n\r\n\"Much of the poetry of this time was the outcome of poetical\r\ntournaments at which themes were proposed to the competitors by\r\njudges who examined each phrase and word with the minutest critical\r\ncare before pronouncing their verdict. As might be expected, the\r\npoetry produced in those circumstances is of a more or less\r\nartificial type, and is wanting in the spontaneous vigour of the\r\nearlier essays of the Japanese muse. Conceits, acrostics, and\r\nuntranslatable word-plays hold much too prominent a place, but for\r\nperfection of form the poems of this time are unrivalled. It is no\r\ndoubt to this quality that the great popularity of the Kokin-shu is\r\ndue. Sei Shonagon, writing in the early years of the eleventh\r\ncentury, sums up a young lady's education as consisting of writing,\r\nmusic, and the twenty volumes of the Kokin-shu.\"*\r\n\r\n*Japanese Literature, by W. G. Aston.\r\n\r\nThe first notable specimen of prose in Japanese style (wabun) was the\r\npreface to the Kokin-shu, written by Ki no Tsurayuki, who contended,\r\nand his own composition proved, that the introduction of Chinese\r\nwords might well be dispensed with in writing Japanese. But what may\r\nbe called the classical form of Japanese prose was fixed by the\r\nTaketori Monogatari,* an anonymous work which appeared at the\r\nbeginning of the Engi era (901),** and was quickly followed by\r\nothers. Still, the honour in which the ideograph was held never\r\ndiminished. When Tsurayuki composed the Tosa Nikki (Tosa Diary), he\r\ngave it out as the work of a woman, so reluctant was he to identify\r\nhimself with a book written in the kana syllabary; and the Emperor\r\nSaga, Kobo Daishi, and Tachibana Hayanari will be remembered forever\r\nin Japan as the \"Three Calligraphists\" (Sampitsu).\r\n\r\n*The expression \"monogatari\" finds its nearest English equivalent in\r\n\"narrative.\"\r\n\r\n**An excellent translation of this has been made by Mr. F. V. Dickins\r\nin the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,\" Jan., 1887.\r\n\r\nIn short, an extraordinary love of literature and of all that\r\npertained to it swayed the minds of Japan throughout the Nara and the\r\nHeian epochs. The ninth and tenth centuries produced such poets as\r\nAriwara no Yukihira and his younger brother, Narihira; Otomo no\r\nKuronushi, Ochikochi no Mitsune, Sojo Henjo, and the poetess Ono no\r\nKomachi; gave us three anthologies (Sandai-shu), the Kokin-shu, the\r\nGosen-shu, and the Shui-shu, as well as five of the Six National\r\nHistories (Roku Kokushi), the Zoku Nihonki, the Nihon Koki, the Zoku\r\nNihon Koki, the Montoku Jitsuroku, and the Sandai Jitsuroku; and saw\r\na bureau of poetry (W aka-dokoro) established in Kyoto. Fine art also\r\nwas cultivated, and it is significant that calligraphy and painting\r\nwere coupled together in the current expression (shogwa) for products\r\nof pictorial art. Kudara no Kawanari and Koze no Kanaoka, the first\r\nJapanese painters to achieve great renown, flourished in the ninth\r\nand tenth centuries, as did also a famous architect, Hida no Takumi.\r\n\r\nINTERVAL BETWEEN THE CAPITAL AND THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\nThus, in the capital, Kyoto, where the Fujiwara family constituted\r\nthe power behind the Throne, refinements and luxury were constantly\r\ndeveloped, and men as well as women amused themselves composing\r\nChinese and Japanese poems, playing on musical instruments, dancing,\r\nand making picnics to view the blossoms of the four seasons. But in\r\nthe provincial districts very different conditions existed. There,\r\nmen, being virtually without any knowledge of the ideographic script,\r\nfound the literature and the laws of the capital a sealed book to\r\nthem, and as for paying periodical visits to Kyoto, what that\r\ninvolved may be gathered from the fact that the poet Tsurayuki's\r\nreturn to the capital from the province of Tosa, where he had served\r\nas acting governor, occupied one hundred days, as shown in his Tosa\r\nNikki (Diary of a Journey from Tosa), and that thirteen days were\r\nneeded to get from the mouth of the Yodo to the city. The pageant of\r\nmetropolitan civilization and magnificence never presented itself to\r\nprovincial eyes.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE SHOEN\r\n\r\nMuch has already been said on the subject of land tenure; but as this\r\nproblem is responsible for some cardinal phases of Japanese history,\r\na brief resume will be useful here. There were four chief causes for\r\nthe existence of shoen, or manors. The first was reclamation. In the\r\nyear 723, it was decreed that persons who reclaimed land should\r\nacquire a de facto title of tenure for three generations, and, twenty\r\nyears later, the tenure of title was made perpetual, limits of area\r\nbeing fixed, however--1250 acres for princes and nobles of the first\r\nrank, and thereafter by various gradations, to twenty-five acres for\r\na commoner. But these limits were not enforced, and in the year 767\r\nit became necessary to issue a decree prohibiting further\r\nreclamation, which was followed, seventeen years later, by a rescript\r\nforbidding provincial governors to exact forced labour for tilling\r\ntheir manors.\r\n\r\nThat this did not check the evil is proved by an official record,\r\ncompiled in 797, from which it appears that princes and influential\r\nnobles possessed manors of great extent; that they appointed\r\nintendants to manage them; that these intendants themselves engaged\r\nin operations of reclamation; that they abused their power by\r\ndespoiling the peasants, and that dishonest farmers made a practice\r\nof evading taxes and tribute by settling within the bounds of a\r\nmanor. These abuses reached their acme during the reigns of Uda and\r\nDaigo (888-930), when people living in the vicinity of a manor were\r\nruthlessly robbed and plundered by the intendant and his servants,\r\nand when it became habitual to elude the payment of taxes by making\r\nspurious assignments of lands to influential officials in the\r\ncapital. In vain was the ownership of lands by powerful nobles\r\ninterdicted, and in vain its purchase by provincial governors: the\r\nmetropolis had no power to enforce its vetoes in the provinces, and\r\nthe provincials ignored them. Thus the shoen grew in number and\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe second factor which contributed to the extension of manors was\r\nthe bestowal of estates in perpetuity on persons of conspicuous\r\nability, and afterwards on men who enjoyed Imperial favour. Land thus\r\ngranted was called shiden and enjoyed immunity from taxation. Then\r\nthere were tracts given in recognition of public merit. These koden\r\nwere originally of limited tenure, but that condition soon ceased to\r\nbe observed, and the koden fell into the same category with manors\r\n(shoen).\r\n\r\nFinally we have the jiden, or temple lands. These, too, were at the\r\noutset granted for fixed terms, but when Buddhism became powerful the\r\nlimitation ceased to be operative, and moreover, in defiance of the\r\nlaw, private persons presented tracts, large or small, to the temples\r\nwhere the mortuary tablets of their families were preserved, and the\r\ntemples, oh their own account, acquired estates by purchase or by\r\nreclamation. The jiden, like the other three kinds of land enumerated\r\nabove, were exempt from taxation. Owned by powerful nobles or\r\ninfluential families, the shoen were largely cultivated by forced\r\nlabour, and as in many cases it paid the farmers better to rent such\r\nland; and thus escape all fiscal obligations, than to till their own\r\nfields, the latter were deserted pan passu with the development of\r\nthe manor system, and thus the State revenues suffered dual\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of the tenth century peremptory edicts were\r\nissued to check this state of affairs, but the power of the Court to\r\nexact obedience had then dwindled almost to cipher. History records\r\nthat during the Ho-en era (1135-1140), the regent Fujiwara\r\nTadamichi's manor of Shimazu comprised one-fourth of the province of\r\nOsumi. On these great manors, alike of nobles and of temples, armed\r\nforces soon began to be maintained for purposes nominally of police\r\nprotection but ultimately of military aggression. This was especially\r\nthe case on the shoen of the puissant families of Taira and Minamoto.\r\nThus, Minamoto Yoshitomo came to own fifteen of the eastern\r\nprovinces, and in the tumult of the Heiji era (1159-1160), he lost\r\nall these to Taira no Kiyomori, who, supplementing them with his own\r\nalready large manors and with the shoen of many other nobles and\r\ntemples, became owner of five hundred districts comprising about\r\none-half of the empire. Subsequently, when the Minamoto crushed the\r\nTaira (1185), the whole of the latter's estates were distributed by\r\nthe former among the nobles who had fought under the Minamoto\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nIn that age the holders of manors were variously called ryoshu,\r\nryoke, shoya, or honjo, and the intendants were termed shocho, shoji,\r\nkengyo, betto, or yoryudo, a diversity of nomenclature that is often\r\nvery perplexing. In many cases reclaimed lands went by the name of\r\nthe person who had reclaimed them. Such manors were spoken of as\r\nmyoden (name-land), and those owning large tracts were designated\r\ndaimyo (great name), while smaller holders were termed shomyo. Yet\r\nanother term for the intendants of these lands was nanushi-shoku.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that in the presence of such a system the\r\nlands paying taxes to the Central Government became steadily less and\r\nless. Thus, in the reign of the Emperor Toba (1108-1123), the State\r\ndomains administered by the provincial governors are recorded to have\r\nbeen only one per cent, of the area of the provinces. In these\r\ncircumstances, the governors deemed it unnecessary to proceed\r\nthemselves to their posts; they remained in Kyoto and despatched\r\ndeputies to the provinces, a course which conspired to reduce the\r\nauthority of the Crown.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of intelligent sequence of ideas, the above synopsis\r\nmakes some departure from the chronological order of these pages.\r\nReturning to the early part of the tenth century, the historian may\r\naffirm that the salient features of the era were virtual abrogation\r\nof the Daiho laws imposing restrictions upon the area and period of\r\nland-ownership; rapid growth of tax-free manors and consequent\r\nimpoverishment of the Court in Kyoto; the appearance of provincial\r\nmagnates who yielded scant obedience to the Crown, and the\r\norganization of military classes which acknowledged the authority of\r\ntheir own leaders only.\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF TAIRA NO MASAKADO\r\n\r\nThe above state of affairs soon bore practical fruit. In the year\r\n930, the Emperor Daigo died and was succeeded by his son Shujaku, a\r\nchild of eight, whose mother was a daughter of Fujiwara Mototsune. In\r\naccordance with the system now fully established, Fujiwara Tadahira\r\nbecame regent. History depicts this Tadahira as an effeminate\r\ndilettante, one of whose foibles was to have a cuckoo painted on his\r\nfan and to imitate the cry of the bird whenever he opened it. But as\r\nrepresentative of the chief aristocratic family in an age when to be\r\na Fujiwara was to possess a title superior to that conferred by\r\nability in any form and however conspicuous, his right to administer\r\nthe government in the capacity of regent obtained universal\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nIt had become the custom at that time for the provincial magnates to\r\nsend their sons to Kyoto, where they served in the corps of guards,\r\nbecame acquainted with refined life, and established relations of\r\nfriendship with the Taira and the Minamoto, the former descended from\r\nthe Emperor Kwammu, the latter from the Emperor Seiwa. Thus, at the\r\ntime of Daigo's death, a scion of the Taira, by name Masakado, was\r\nserving under Tadahira in the capital. Believing himself endowed with\r\nhigh military capacity, Masakado aspired to be appointed kebiishi of\r\nhis native province, Shimosa. But his archery, his horsemanship, and\r\nhis fencing elicited no applause in Kyoto, whereas a relative,\r\nSadabumi, attracted admiration by a licentious life.\r\n\r\nMasakado finally retired to Shimosa in an angry mood. At first,\r\nhowever, the idea of revolt does not seem to have occurred to him. On\r\nthe contrary, the evidence is against such a hypothesis. For his\r\nmilitary career began with family feuds, and after he had killed one\r\nof his uncles on account of a dispute about the boundaries of a\r\nmanor, and sacked the residence of another in consequence of a\r\ntrouble about a woman, he did not hesitate to obey a summons to Kyoto\r\nto answer for his acts of violence. Such quarrels were indeed of not\r\nuncommon occurrence in the provinces, as is shown by the memorial of\r\nMiyoshi Kiyotsura, and the capital appears to have left them severely\r\nalone, so far as practical interference was concerned, though the\r\npretence of jurisdiction might be preserved. Thus, Masakado was\r\nacquitted after the formality of investigation had been satisfied.\r\nNaturally this judgment did not prove a deterrent; on the contrary,\r\nit amounted to a mandate.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Kwanto, Masakado was soon found once more in the\r\narena. The details of his campaign have little interest except as\r\nindicating that the provincial officials followed the example of\r\nKyoto in suffering local disturbances to settle themselves, and that\r\nthe abuses catalogued in the Miyoshi memorial were true to fact. A\r\nraid that Masakado made into Musashi province is memorable as the\r\noccasion of the first collision between the Taira and the Minamoto,*\r\nwhich great families were destined ultimately to convert all Japan\r\ninto a battlefield. Finally, Masakado carried his raids so far that\r\nhe allowed himself to be persuaded of the hopelessness of pardon. It\r\nwas then that he resolved to revolt. Overrunning the whole eight\r\nprovinces of the Kwanto, he appointed his own partisans to all posts\r\nof importance and set up a court after the Kyoto model. A letter\r\nwritten by him at this time to the regent Tadahira affords an\r\ninteresting guide to the ethics of the era:\r\n\r\n\"The genealogy of my house shows that I am the fifth in descent from\r\nthe Emperor Kwammu. Therefore, though I hold one-half of a province,\r\nthat cannot be attributed to mere good fortune. In the history of\r\nancient times there are occasions where a whole country was\r\nappropriated by force of arms. Nature has endowed me with military\r\ntalent. None, I presume, excels me in that respect. You, however, had\r\nno praise to bestow on me. Rather was I frequently reprimanded when I\r\nserved in the capital, so that my shame was unendurable, whereas your\r\nsympathy would have delighted me. While Masakado was still a youth he\r\nserved Tadahira, the prime minister, for tens of years, and when\r\nTadahira became regent, Masakado never entertained his present\r\nproject. I have no words to express my regret. Though I have\r\nconspired to revolt, I will not forget my old master, and I hope that\r\nhe will make allowances for the circumstances in which I am placed.\"\r\n\r\n*The vice-governor of Musashi, Minamoto Tsunemoto, was at feud with\r\nthe governor, Prince Okiyo, and Masakado espoused the latter's cause.\r\n\r\nHad it rested with Kyoto to subdue this revolt, Masakado might have\r\nattained his goal. But chance and the curious spirit of the time\r\nfought for the Court. A trifling breach of etiquette on the part of\r\nMasakado--not pausing to bind up his hair before receiving a\r\nvisitor--forfeited the co-operation of a great soldier, Fujiwara\r\nHidesato, (afterwards known as Tawara Toda), and the latter, joining\r\nforces with Taira Sadamori, whose father Masakado had killed,\r\nattacked the rebels in a moment of elated carelessness, shattered\r\nthem completely, and sent Masakado's head to the capital. The whole\r\naffair teaches that the Fujiwara aristocrats, ruling in Kyoto, had\r\nneither power nor inclination to meddle with provincial\r\nadministration, and that the districts distant from the metropolis\r\nwore practically under the sway of military magnates in whose eyes\r\nmight constituted right. This was especially notable in the case of\r\nthe Kwanto, that is to say the eight provinces surrounding the\r\npresent Tokyo Bay, extending north to the Nikko Mountains. Musashi,\r\nindeed, was so infested with law-breakers that, from the days of the\r\nEmperor Seiwa (859-876), it became customary to appoint one kebiishi\r\nin each of its districts, whereas elsewhere the establishment was one\r\nto each province. The kebiishi represented the really puissant arm of\r\nthe law, the provincial governors, originally so powerful, having now\r\ndegenerated into weaklings.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLT OF FUJIWARA SUMITOMO\r\n\r\nAnother event, characteristic of the time, occurred in Nankai-do (the\r\nfour provinces of the island of Shikoku) contemporaneously with the\r\nrevolt of Masakado. During the Shohei era (931-937) the ravages of\r\npirates became so frequent in those waters that Fujiwara no Sumitomo\r\nwas specially despatched from Kyoto to restrain them. This he\r\neffected without difficulty. But instead of returning to the capital,\r\nhe collected a number of armed men together with a squadron of\r\nvessels, and conducted a campaign of spoliation and outrage in the\r\nwaters of the Inland Sea as well as the channels of Kii and Bungo.\r\nMasakado's death, in 939, relieved the Court from the pressure in the\r\neast, and an expedition was despatched against Sumitomo under the\r\ncommand of Ono no Yoshifuru, general of the guards.\r\n\r\nYoshifuru mustered only two hundred ships whereas Sumitomo had\r\nfifteen hundred. The issue might have been foretold had not the\r\npirate chief's lieutenant gone over to the Imperial forces. Sumitomo,\r\nafter an obstinate resistance and after one signal success, was\r\nfinally routed and killed. Some historians* have contended that\r\nMasakado and Sumitomo, when they were together in Kyoto, conspired a\r\nsimultaneous revolt in the east and the south; but such a conclusion\r\nis inconsistent with the established fact that Masakado's treason was\r\nnot premeditated.\r\n\r\n*Notably the authors of the Okagami and the Nihon Gwaishi.\r\n\r\nThat the two events synchronized is attributable wholly to the\r\nconditions of the time. We have seen what was the state of affairs in\r\nKwanto, and that of Kyushu and Shikoku is clearly set forth in a\r\nmemorial presented (946) by Ono Yoshifuru on his return from the\r\nSumitomo campaign. In that document he says: \"My information is that\r\nthose who pursue irregular courses are not necessarily sons of\r\nprovincial governors alone. Many others make lawless use of power and\r\nauthority; form confederacies; engage daily in military exercises;\r\ncollect and maintain men and horses under pretext of hunting game;\r\nmenace the district governors; plunder the common people; violate\r\ntheir wives and daughters, and steal their beasts of burden and\r\nemploy them for their own purposes, thus interrupting agricultural\r\noperations. Yesterday, they were outcasts, with barely sufficient\r\nclothes to cover their nakedness; to-day, they ride on horseback and\r\ndon rich raiment. Meanwhile the country falls into a state of decay,\r\nand the homesteads are desolate. My appeal is that, with the\r\nexception of provincial governors' envoys, any who enter a province\r\nat the head of parties carrying bows and arrows, intimidate the\r\ninhabitants, and rob them of their property, shall be recognized as\r\ncommon bandits and thrown into prison on apprehension.\"\r\n\r\nIn a word, the aristocratic officialdom in Kyoto, headed by the\r\nFujiwara, though holding all the high administrative posts, wielded\r\nno real power outside the capital, nor were they competent to\r\npreserve order even within its precincts, for the palace itself was\r\nnot secure against incendiarism and depredation. When the heads of\r\nthe Minamoto and the Taira families were appointed provincial\r\ngovernors in the Kwanto, they trained their servants in the use of\r\narms, calling them iye-no-ko (house-boys) or rodo (retainers), and\r\nother local magnates purchased freedom from molestation by doing\r\nhomage and obeying their behests. Taira Masakado, Minamoto Tsunemoto,\r\nFujiwara Hidesato, and Taira Sadamori, who figure in the above\r\nnarrative, were all alike provincial chiefs, possessing private\r\nestates and keeping armed retinues which they used for protection or\r\nfor plunder. The Imperial Court, when confronted with any crisis, was\r\nconstrained to borrow the aid of these magnates, and thus there came\r\ninto existence the buke, or military houses, as distinguished from\r\nthe kuge, or Court houses.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: UMBRELLAS\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KINKAKU-JI, AT KYOTO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITAL AND THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE FUJIWARA\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at a period of Japanese history in which the relations\r\nof the Fujiwara family to the Throne are so complicated as greatly to\r\nperplex even the most careful reader. But as it is not possible to\r\nconstruct a genealogical table of a really helpful character, the\r\nfacts will be set down here in their simplest form.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-SECOND SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR MURAKAMI (A.D. 947-967)\r\n\r\nMurakami, son of Daigo by the daughter of the regent, Fujiwara\r\nMototsune, ascended the throne in succession to Shujaku, and Fujiwara\r\nTadahira held the post of regent, as he had done in Shujaku's time,\r\nhis three sons, Saneyori, Morosuke, and Morotada, giving their\r\ndaughters; one, Morosuke's offspring, to be Empress, the other two to\r\nbe consorts of the sovereign. Moreover, Morosuke's second daughter\r\nwas married to the Emperor's younger brother, Prince Takaaki, who\r\nafterwards descended from princely rank to take the family name of\r\nMinamoto. Saneyori, Morosuke, and Takaaki took a prominent part in\r\nthe administration of State affairs, and thus indirectly by female\r\ninfluence at Court, or by their own direct activity, the Fujiwara\r\nheld a supreme place. Murakami has a high position among Japan's\r\nmodel sovereigns. He showed keen and intelligent interest in\r\npolitics; he sought to employ able officials; he endeavoured to check\r\nluxury, and he solicited frank guidance from his elders. Thus later\r\ngenerations learned to indicate Engi (901-923), when Daigo reigned,\r\nand Tenryaku (947-957), when Murakami reigned, as essentially eras of\r\nbenevolent administration. But whatever may have been the personal\r\nqualities of Murakami, however conspicuous his poetical ability and\r\nhowever sincere his solicitude for the welfare of his subjects, he\r\nfailed signally to correct the effeminate tendency of Kyoto society\r\nor to protect the lives and property of his people. Bandits raided\r\nthe capital, broke into the palace itself, set fire to it, and\r\ncommitted frequent depredations unrestrained. An age when the\r\nmachinery for preserving law and order was practically paralyzed\r\nscarcely deserves the eulogies of posterity.\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nThe lady with whom Murakami first consorted was a daughter of\r\nFujiwara Motokata, who represented a comparatively obscure branch of\r\nthe great family, and had attained the office of chief councillor of\r\nState (dainagori) only. She bore to his Majesty a son, Hirohira, and\r\nthe boy's grandfather confidently looked to see him named Prince\r\nImperial. But presently the daughter of Fujiwara Morosuke, minister\r\nof the Right, entered the palace, and although her Court rank was not\r\nat first superior to that of the dainagon's daughter, her child had\r\nbarely reached its third month when, through Morosuke's irresistible\r\ninfluence, it was nominated heir to the throne. Motokata's\r\ndisappointment proved so keen that his health became impaired and he\r\nfinally died--of chagrin, the people said. In those days men believed\r\nin the power of disembodied spirits for evil or for good. The spirit\r\nof the ill-fated Sugawara Michizane was appeased by building shrines\r\nto his memory, and a similar resource exorcised the angry ghost of\r\nthe rebel, Masakado; but no such prevention having been adopted in\r\nthe case of Motokata, his spirit was supposed to have compassed the\r\nearly deaths of his grandson's supplanter, Reizei, and of the\r\nlatter's successors, Kwazan and Sanjo, whose three united reigns\r\ntotalled only five years.\r\n\r\nA more substantial calamity resulted, however, from the habit of\r\nignoring the right of primogeniture in favour of arbitrary selection.\r\nMurakami, seeing that the Crown Prince (Reizei) had an exceedingly\r\nfeeble physique, deemed it expedient to transfer the succession to\r\nhis younger brother, Tamehira. But the latter, having married into\r\nthe Minamoto family, had thus become ineligible for the throne in\r\nFujiwara eyes. The Emperor hesitated, therefore, to give open\r\nexpression to his views, and while he waited, he himself fell\r\nmortally ill. On his death-bed he issued the necessary instruction,\r\nbut the Fujiwara deliberately ignored it, being determined that a\r\nconsort of their own blood must be the leading lady in every Imperial\r\nhousehold. Then the indignation of the other great families, the\r\nMinamoto and the Taira, blazed out. Mitsunaka, representing the\r\nformer, and Shigenobu the latter, entered into a conspiracy to\r\ncollect an army in the Kwanto and march against Kyoto with the sole\r\nobject of compelling obedience to Murakami's dying behest. The plot\r\nwas divulged by Minamoto Mitsunaka in the sequel of a quarrel with\r\nTaira no Shigenobu; the plotters were all exiled, and Takaaki,\r\nyoungest son of the Emperor Daigo, though wholly ignorant of the\r\nconspiracy, was falsely accused to the Throne by Fujiwara Morotada,\r\ndeprived of his post of minister of the Left, to which his accuser\r\nwas nominated, and sent to that retreat for disgraced officials, the\r\nDazai-fu. Another instance is here furnished of the readiness with\r\nwhich political rivals slandered one another in old Japan, and\r\nanother instance, also, of the sway exercised over the sovereign by\r\nhis Fujiwara ministers.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-THIRD SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR REIZEI (A.D. 968-969)\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-FOURTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR ENYU (A.D. 970-984)\r\n\r\nThe reigns of Reizei and Enyu are remarkable for quarrels among the\r\nmembers of the Fujiwara family--quarrels which, to be followed\r\nintelligently, require frequent reference to the genealogical table\r\n(page 203). Fujiwara Morosuke had five sons, Koretada, Kanemichi,\r\nKaneiye, Tamemitsu, and Kinsuye. Two of these, Koretada and Kaneiye,\r\npresented one each of their daughters to the Emperor Reizei, and\r\nKoretada's daughter gave birth to Prince Morosada, who afterwards\r\nreigned as Kwazan, while Kaneiye's daughter bore Okisada,\r\nsubsequently the Emperor Sanjo. After one year's reign, Reizei, who\r\nsuffered from brain disease, abdicated in favour of his younger\r\nbrother, Enyu, then only in his eleventh year. Fujiwara Saneyori\r\nacted as regent, but, dying shortly afterwards, was succeeded in that\r\noffice by his nephew, Koretada, who also had to resign on account of\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nBetween this latter's two brothers, Kanemichi and Kaneiye, keen\r\ncompetition for the regency now sprang up. Kanemichi's eldest\r\ndaughter was the Empress of Enyu, but his Majesty favoured Kaneiye,\r\nwho thus attained much higher rank than his elder brother. Kanemichi,\r\nhowever, had another source of influence. His sister was Murakami's\r\nEmpress and mother of the reigning sovereign, Enyu. This Imperial\r\nlady, writing to his Majesty Enyu at Kanemichi's dictation, conjured\r\nthe Emperor to be guided by primogeniture in appointing a regent, and\r\nEnyu, though he bitterly disliked Kanemichi, could not gainsay his\r\nmother. Thus Kanemichi became chancellor and acting regent. The\r\nstruggle was not concluded, however. It ended in the palace itself,\r\nwhither the two brothers repaired almost simultaneously, Kanemichi\r\nrising from his sick-bed for the purpose. In the presence of the boy\r\nEmperor, Kanemichi arbitrarily transferred his own office of kwampaku\r\nto Fujiwara Yoritada and degraded his brother, Kaneiye, to a\r\ncomparatively insignificant post. The sovereign acquiesced; he had no\r\nchoice. A few months later, this dictator died. It is related of him\r\nthat his residence was more gorgeous than the palace and his manner\r\nof life more sumptuous than the sovereign's. The men of his time were\r\nwont to say, \"A tiger's mouth is less fatal than the frown of the\r\nregent, Kanemichi.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-FIFTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KWAZAN (A.D. 985-986)\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-SIXTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR ICHIJO (A.D. 987-1011)\r\n\r\nEldest son of the Emperor Reizei, Kwazan ascended the throne in 985.\r\nHis mother was a daughter of Fujiwara Koretada, and Yoritada, whose\r\nappointment as regent has just been described, continued to act in\r\nthat capacity. Kaneiye's opportunity had now come. Kwazan having\r\nsucceeded Enyu, nominated the latter's son to be Crown Prince,\r\ninstead of conferring the position on his own brother, Prince Okisada\r\n(afterwards Sanjo). Now the Crown Prince was the son of Kaneiye's\r\ndaughter, and that ambitious noble determined to compass the\r\nsovereign's abdication without delay. Kwazan, originally a fickle\r\nlover, had ultimately conceived an absorbing passion for the lady\r\nTsuneko. He could not be induced to part with her even at the time of\r\nher pregnancy, and as there was no proper provision in the palace for\r\nsuch an event, Tsuneko died in labour. Kwazan, distraught with grief,\r\nwas approached by Kaneiye's son, Michikane, who urged him to retire\r\nfrom the world and seek in Buddhism the perfect peace thus alone\r\nattainable. Michikane declared his own intention of entering the\r\n\"path,\" and on a moonlight night the two men, leaving the palace,\r\nrepaired to the temple Gwangyo-ji to take the tonsure. There,\r\nMichikane, pretending he wished to bid final farewell to his family,\r\ndeparted to return no more, and the Emperor understood that he had\r\nbeen deceived.\r\n\r\nRetreat was now impossible, however. He abdicated in favour of\r\nIchijo, a child of seven, and Kaneiye became regent and chancellor.\r\nHe emulated the magnificence of his deceased brother and rival,\r\nKanemichi, and his residence at Higashi-Sanjo in Kyoto was built\r\nafter the model of the \"hall of freshness\" in the palace. He had five\r\nsons, the most remarkable of whom were Michitaka, Michikane, and\r\nMichinaga. It will be presently seen that in the hands of the last\r\nthe power of the Fujiwara reached its zenith. On the death of Kaneiye\r\nthe office of kwampaku fell to his eldest son, Michitaka, and, in\r\n993, the latter being seriously ill, his son, Korechika, looked to be\r\nhis successor. But the honour fell to Michitaka's brother, Michikane.\r\nSeven days after his nomination, Michikane died, and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, men said that he had been done to death by the incantations\r\nof his ambitious nephew. Again, however, the latter was disappointed.\r\nKaneiye's third son, Michinaga, succeeded to the regency.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, the new regent seems to have determined that his\r\ndaughter should be Empress. But the daughter of his elder brother,\r\nthe late Michitaka, already held that position. This, however,\r\nconstituted no sort of obstacle in the eyes of the omnipotent\r\nMichinaga. He induced--\"required\" would probably be a more accurate\r\nexpression--the Empress to abandon the world, shave her head, and\r\nremove to a secluded palace, (the Kokideri); where-after he caused\r\nhis own daughter to become the Imperial consort under the title of\r\nchugu,* her residence being fixed in the Fujitsubo, which was the\r\nrecognized palace of the Empress.\r\n\r\n*A lady on introduction to the palace received the title of jokwan.\r\nIf the daughter of a minister of State, she was called nyogo. Chugu\r\nwas a still higher title devised specially for Michinaga's purpose,\r\nand naturally it became a precedent.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be imagined that with such a despotic regent, the\r\nEmperor himself exercised any real authority. The annals show that\r\nIchijo was of benevolent disposition; that he sympathized with his\r\npeople; that he excelled in prose composition and possessed much\r\nskill in music. Further, during his reign of twenty-four years many\r\nable men graced the era. But neither their capacity nor his own found\r\nopportunity for exercise in the presence of Michinaga's proteges,\r\nand, while profoundly disliking the Fujiwara autocrat, Ichijo was\r\nconstrained to suffer him.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-SEVENTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR SANJO (A.D. 1012-1017)\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTY-EIGHTH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-ICHIJO (A.D. 1017-1036)\r\n\r\nPrince Okisada, younger brother of the Emperor Kwazan, ascended the\r\nthrone at the age of thirty-six, on the abdication of Ichijo, and is\r\nknown in history as Sanjo. Before his accession he had married the\r\ndaughter of Fujiwara Naritoki, to whom he was much attached, but with\r\nthe crown he had to accept the second daughter of Michinaga as chugu,\r\nhis former consort becoming Empress. His Majesty had to acquiesce in\r\nanother arbitrary arrangement also. It has been shown above that\r\nMichinaga's eldest daughter had been given the title of chugu in the\r\npalace of Ichijo, to whom she bore two sons, Atsunari and Atsunaga.\r\nNeither of these had any right to be nominated Crown Prince in\r\npreference to Sanjo's offspring. Michinaga, however, caused Atsunari\r\nto be appointed Prince Imperial, ignoring Sanjo's son, since his\r\nmother belonged to an inferior branch of the Fujiwara. Further, it\r\ndid not suit the regent's convenience that a ruler of mature age\r\nshould occupy the throne. An eye disease from which Sanjo suffered\r\nbecame the pretext for pressing him to abdicate, and, in 1017,\r\nAtsunari, then in his ninth year, took the sceptre as Emperor\r\nGo-Ichijo, or Ichijo II. Michinaga continued to act as regent,\r\nholding, at the same time, the office of minister of the Left, but he\r\nsubsequently handed over the regency to his son, Yorimichi, becoming\r\nhimself chancellor.\r\n\r\nGo-Ichijo was constrained to endure at Michinaga's hands the same\r\ndespotic treatment as that previously meted out to Sanjo. The\r\nlegitimate claim of his offspring to the throne was ignored in favour\r\nof his brother, Atsunaga, who received for consort the fourth\r\ndaughter of Michinaga. Thus, this imperious noble had controlled the\r\nadministration for thirty years; had given his daughters to three\r\nEmperors; had appointed his son to be regent in his place, and had\r\nthe Crown Prince for grandson. Truly, as his historians say, he held\r\nthe empire in the hollow of his hand. His estates far exceeded those\r\nof the Crown; the presents offered to him by all ranks reached an\r\nenormous total; he built for himself a splendid mansion (Jotomon)\r\nwith forced labour requisitioned from the provinces, and for his wife\r\na scarcely less magnificent residence (Kyogoku) was erected at the\r\ncharges of the Emperor Go-Ichijo. At the approach of illness he took\r\nrefuge in Buddhism, but even here the gorgeous ostentation of his\r\nlife was not abated. He planned the building of a monastery which\r\nshould prove a worthy retreat for his declining years, and it is on\r\nrecord that his order to the provincial governor was, \"though you\r\nneglect your official duties, do not neglect to furnish materials and\r\nlabour for the building of Hojo-ji.\" Even from the palace itself\r\nstones were taken for this monastery, and the sums lavished upon it\r\nwere so enormous that they dwarfed Michinaga's previous\r\nextravagances. Michinaga retired there to die, and on his death-bed\r\nhe received a visit from the Emperor, who ordered three months' Court\r\nmourning on his decease. There is a celebrated work entitled Eigwa\r\nMonogatari (Tales of Splendour), wherein is depicted the fortunes and\r\nthe foibles of the Fujiwara family from the days (889) of the Emperor\r\nUda to those (1092) of the Emperor Horikawa. Specially minute is the\r\nchronicle when it treats of the Mido kwampaku, as Michinaga was\r\ncalled after he set himself to build the monastery Hojo-ji.\r\n\r\nLoyal Japanese historians shrink from describing this era, when the\r\noccupants of the throne were virtually puppets in the hands of the\r\nFujiwara. There was, however, one redeeming feature: amid this luxury\r\nand refinement literature flourished vigorously, so that the era of\r\nTenryaku (947-957) lives in the memory of the nation as vividly as\r\nthat of Engi (901-923). Oye Tomotsuna, Sugawara Fumitoki, Minamoto\r\nShitago--these were famous littérateurs, and Minamoto Hiromasa,\r\ngrandson of the Emperor Uda, attained celebrity as a musical genius.\r\nComing to the reigns of Kwazan, Enyu, and Ichijo (985-1011), we find\r\nthe immortal group of female writers, Murasaki Shikibu, Izumi\r\nShikibu, Sei Shonagon, and Akazome Emon; we find also in the Imperial\r\nfamily, Princes Kaneakira and Tomohira; we find three famous scribes,\r\nFujiwara Yukinari, Fujiwara Sari, and Ono no Tofu, and, finally the\r\n\"Four Nagon\" (Shi-nagori), Fujiwara Yukinari, Fujiwara Kinto.\r\nMinamoto Narinobu, and Minamoto Toshikata.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that in this necessarily brief summary the name\r\n\"Minamoto\" occurs several times, as does that of \"Fujiwara\" also. But\r\nthat the scions of either family confined themselves to the arts of\r\npeace, is not to be inferred. There were Fujiwara among the military\r\nmagnates in the provinces, and we shall presently see the Minamoto\r\ntaking the lead in the science of war. Already, indeed, the Fujiwara\r\nin the capital were beginning to recognize the power of the Minamoto.\r\nIt has been related above that one of the rebel Masakado's earliest\r\nopponents was a Minamoto, vice-governor of Musashi. His son,\r\nMitsunaka, a redoubtable warrior, assisted the Fujiwara in Kyoto, and\r\nMitsunaka's sons, Yorimitsu and Yorinobu, contributed materially to\r\nthe autocracy of the regent Michinaga. Yorimitsu was appointed by the\r\nregent to command the cavalry of the guard, and he is said to have\r\nbrought that corps to a state of great efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, much need of a strong hand. One had only to emerge\r\nfrom the palace gates to find oneself among the haunts of bandits.\r\nThe names of such robber chiefs as Hakamadare no Yasusuke, Kidomaru,\r\nOeyama Shutendoji, and Ibaraki-doji have been handed down as the\r\nheroes in many a strange adventure and the perpetrators of many\r\nheinous crimes. Even the Fujiwara residences were not secure against\r\nthe torches of these plunderers, and during the reign of Ichijo the\r\npalace itself was frequently fired by them. In Go-Ichijo's tune, an\r\nedict was issued forbidding men to carry bows and arrows in the\r\nstreets, but had there been power to enforce such a veto, its\r\nenactment would not have been necessary. Its immediate sequel was\r\nthat the bandits broke into Government offices and murdered officials\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nTHE INVASION OF JAPAN BY THE TOI\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1019, when Go-Ichijo occupied the throne, a large\r\nhost of invaders suddenly poured into the island of Tsushima. There\r\nhad not been any warning. Tsushima lies half-way between the south of\r\nKorea and the northeast of Kyushu, distant about sixty miles from\r\neither coast. Since the earliest times, its fine harbours had served\r\nas a military station for ships plying between Japan and Korea, but\r\nsuch intercourse had long been interrupted when this invasion took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe invaders were the Toi, originally called Sushen or Moho, under\r\nthe former of which names they make their appearance in Japanese\r\nhistory in the middle of the sixth century. They inhabited that part\r\nof the Asiatic continent which lies opposite to the island of Ezo,\r\nbut there is nothing to show what impulse they obeyed in making this\r\nsudden descent upon Japan. Their fleet comprised some fifty vessels\r\nonly, each from forty to sixty feet long and propelled by thirty or\r\nforty oars, but of how many fighting men the whole force consisted,\r\nno record has been preserved. As to arms, they carried swords, bows,\r\nspears, and shields, and in their tactical formation spearmen\r\noccupied the front rank, then came swordsmen, and finally bowmen.\r\nEvery man had a shield. Their arrows were short, measuring little\r\nover a foot, but their bows were powerful, and they seem to have\r\nfought with fierce courage.\r\n\r\nAt first they carried everything before them. The governor of\r\nTsushima, being without any means of defence, fled to the Dazai-fu in\r\nKyushu, and the inhabitants were left to the mercy of the invaders,\r\nwho then pushed on to the island of Iki. There the governor, Fujiwara\r\nMasatada, made a desperate resistance, losing his own life in the\r\nbattle. It is said that of all the inhabitants, one only, a Buddhist\r\npriest, escaped to tell the story.\r\n\r\nTen days after their first appearance off Tsushima, the Toi effected\r\na landing in Chikuzen and marched towards Hakata, plundering,\r\nburning, massacring old folks and children, making prisoners of\r\nadults, and slaughtering cattle and horses for food. It happened,\r\nfortunately, that Takaiye, younger brother of Fujiwara Korechika, was\r\nin command at the Dazai-fu, whither he had repaired partly out of\r\npique, partly to undergo treatment for eye disease at the hands of a\r\nChinese doctor. He met the crisis with the utmost coolness, and made\r\nsuch skilful dispositions for defence that, after three days'\r\nfighting, in which the Japanese lost heavily, Hakata remained\r\nuncaptured.\r\n\r\nHigh winds and rough seas now held the invaders at bay, and in that\r\ninterval the coast defences were repaired and garrisoned, and a fleet\r\nof thirty-eight boats having been assembled, the Japanese assumed the\r\noffensive, ultimately driving the Toi to put to sea. A final attempt\r\nwas made to effect a landing at Matsuura in the neighbouring province\r\nof Hizen, but, after fierce fighting, the invaders had to withdraw\r\naltogether. The whole affair had lasted sixteen days, and the\r\nJapanese losses were 382 killed and 1280 taken prisoners. Two hundred\r\nand eighty of the latter--60 men and 220 women--were subsequently\r\nreturned. They were brought over from Koma six months later by a Koma\r\nenvoy, Chong Cha-ryang, to whom the Court presented three hundred\r\npieces of gold.\r\n\r\nKyoto's attitude towards this incident was most instructive. When the\r\nfirst tidings of the invasion reached the capital, the protection of\r\nheaven was at once invoked by services at Ise and ten other shrines.\r\nBut when, on receipt of news that the danger had been averted, the\r\nquestion of rewarding the victors came up for discussion, a majority\r\nof the leading statesmen contended that, as the affair had been\r\nsettled before the arrival of an Imperial mandate at the Dazai-fu, no\r\nofficial cognizance could be taken of it. This view was ultimately\r\noverruled since the peril had been national, but the rewards\r\nsubsequently given were insignificant, and the event clearly\r\nillustrates the policy of the Central Government--a policy already\r\nnoted in connexion with the revolt of Masakado--namely, that any\r\nemergency dealt with prior to the receipt of an Imperial rescript\r\nmust be regarded as private, whatever its nature, and therefore\r\nbeyond the purview of the law.\r\n\r\nA more effective method of decentralization could not have been\r\ndevised. It was inevitable that, under such a system, the provincial\r\nmagnates should settle matters to their own liking without reference\r\nto Kyoto, and that, the better to enforce their will, they should\r\nequip themselves with armed retinues. In truth, it is not too much to\r\nsay that, from the tenth century, Japan outside the capital became an\r\narena of excursions and alarms, the preservation of peace being\r\nwholly dependent on the ambitions of local magnates.\r\n\r\nA history of all these happenings would be intolerably long and\r\ntedious. Therefore only those that have a national bearing will be\r\nhere set down. Prominent among such is the struggle between the Taira\r\nand the Minamoto in the Kwanto. The origin of these two families has\r\nalready been recounted. Some historians have sought to differentiate\r\nthe metropolitan section of the Minamoto from the provincial\r\nsection--that is to say, the men of luxury and literature who\r\nfrequented the capital, from the men of sword and bow who ruled in\r\nthe provinces. Such differentiation is of little practical value.\r\nSimilar lines of demarcation might be drawn in the case of the Taira\r\nand Fujiwara themselves. If there were great captains in each of\r\nthese famous families, there were also great courtiers. To the former\r\ncategory belonged Taira Tadatsune. For generations his family had\r\nruled in the province of Shimosa and had commanded the allegiance of\r\nall the bushi of the region. Tadatsune held at one time the post of\r\nvice-governor of the neighbouring province of Kazusa, where he\r\nacquired large manors (shoen). In the year 1028, he seized the chief\r\ntown of the latter province, and pushing on into Awa, killed the\r\ngovernor and obtained complete control of the province.* The Court,\r\non receiving news of these events, ordered Minamoto Yorinobu,\r\ngovernor of Kai, and several other provincial governors to attack the\r\nTaira chief.\r\n\r\n*Murdoch, in his History of Japan, says that in three years\r\nTadatsune's aggressions \"reduced the Kwanto to a tangled wilderness.\r\nThus, in the province of Shimosa, in 1027, there had been as much as\r\n58,000 acres under cultivation; but in 1031 this had shrunk to\r\nforty-five acres.\"\r\n\r\nYorinobu did not wait for his associates. Setting out with his son,\r\nYoriyoshi, in 1031, he moved at once against Tadatsune's castle,\r\nwhich stood on the seashore of Shimosa, protected by moats and\r\npalisades, and supposed to be unapproachable from the sea except by\r\nboats, of which Tadatsune had taken care that there should not be any\r\nsupply available. But the Minamoto general learned that the shore\r\nsloped very slowly on the castle front, and marching his men boldly\r\nthrough the water, he delivered a crushing attack.\r\n\r\nFor this exploit, which won loud plaudits, he was appointed\r\ncommandant of the local government office, a post held by his\r\ngrandfather, Tsunemoto, whom we have seen as vice-governor of Musashi\r\nin the days of Masakado; by his father, Mitsunaka, one of the pillars\r\nof the Minamoto family, and by his elder brother, Yorimitsu, who\r\ncommanded the cavalry of the guards in Kyoto. The same post was\r\nsubsequently bestowed on Yorinobu's son, Yoriyoshi, and on the\r\nlatter's son, Yoshiiye, known by posterity as \"Hachiman Taro,\"\r\nJapan's most renowned archer, to whom the pre-eminence of the\r\nMinamoto family was mainly due. Tadatsune had another son, Tsunemasa,\r\nwho was appointed vice-governor of Shimosa and who is generally\r\nspoken of as Chiba-no-suke. The chief importance of these events is\r\nthat they laid the foundation of the Minamoto family's supremacy in\r\nthe Kwanto, and thus permanently influenced the course of Japanese\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF ZEN-KUNEN\r\n\r\nIt is advisable at this stage to make closer acquaintance with the\r\nJapanese bushi (soldier), who has been cursorily alluded to more than\r\nonce in these pages, and who, from the tenth century, acts a\r\nprominent role on the Japanese stage. History is silent as to the\r\nexact date when the term \"bushi\" came into use, but from a very early\r\nera its Japanese equivalent, \"monono-fu,\" was applied to the guards\r\nof the sovereign's palace, and when great provincial magnates began,\r\nabout the tenth century, to support a number of armed retainers,\r\nthese gradually came to be distinguished as bushi. In modern times\r\nthe ethics of the bushi have been analysed under the name \"bushido\"\r\n(the way of the warrior), but of course no such term or any such\r\ncomplete code existed in ancient days. The conduct most appropriate\r\nto a bushi was never embodied in a written code. It derived its\r\nsanctions from the practice of recognized models, and only by\r\nobserving those models can we reach a clear conception of the thing\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HALL OF BYODOIN TEMPLE (1052), AT UJI\r\n\r\nTo that end, brief study may be given to the principal campaigns of\r\nthe eleventh century, namely, the century immediately preceding the\r\nestablishment of military feudalism. It must be premised, however,\r\nthat although the bushi figured mainly on the provincial stage, he\r\nacted an important part in the capital also. There, the Throne and\r\nits Fujiwara entourage were constrained to enlist the co-operation of\r\nthe military nobles for the purpose of controlling the lawless\r\nelements of the population. The Minamoto family were conspicuous in\r\nthat respect. Minamoto Mitsunaka--called also Manchu--served at the\r\nCourt of four consecutive sovereigns from Murakami downwards, was\r\nappointed governor of several provinces, and finally became\r\ncommandant of the local Government office. Yorimitsu, his son, a\r\nstill greater strategist, was a prominent figure at five Courts, from\r\nthe days of Enyu, and his brothers, Yorichika and Yorinobu, rendered\r\nmaterial assistance in securing the supremacy of the great Fujiwara\r\nchief, Michinaga. Indeed, the Minamoto were commonly spoken of as the\r\n\"claws\" of the Fujiwara. It was this Yorinobu who won such fame by\r\nescalading the castle of Taira Tadatsune and who established his\r\nfamily's footing in the Kwanto. His uncle, Yoshimitsu, had a large\r\nestate at Tada in Settsu, and this branch of the family was known as\r\nTada Genji.*\r\n\r\nThen there were:\r\n\r\nThe Yamato Genji descended from Yorichika\r\n\r\n \"  Suruga   \"        \"      \"  Mitsumasa\r\n\r\n \"  Shinano  \"        \"      \"  Mitsunaka\r\n\r\n \"  Uda      \"   of Omi, called also the Sasaki family\r\n\r\n \"  Saga     \"   of Settsu \"     \"    \"  Watanabe\r\n\r\n \"  Hizen    \"   of Hizen  \"     \"    \"  Matsuura\r\n\r\nThe Taira family became famous from the time of Sadamori, who quelled\r\nthe insurrection of Masakado. Of this clan, there were these\r\nbranches:\r\n\r\nThe Daijo-uji of Hitachi, so called because for generations they held\r\nthe office of daijo in Hitachi.\r\n\r\nThe Ise-Heishi of Ise, descended from Korehira, son of Sadamori.\r\n\r\n \"  Shiro-uji of Mutsu, Dewa, Shinano, and Echigo, descended from\r\nShigemori and Koremochi\r\n\r\n \"  Nishina-uji   \"      \"      \"       \"    \"       \"         \" \"\r\n\r\n \"  Iwaki-uji     \"      \"      \"       \"    \"       \"         \" \"\r\n\r\n \"  Miura-no-suke of Musashi, Kazusa, and Shimosa, descendants of\r\nTaira no Yoshibumi\r\n\r\n \"  Chiba-no-suke       \"        \"           \"       \" \"\r\n\r\n \"  Chichibu-uji        \"        \"           \"       \" \"\r\n\r\nSoma family, who succeeded to the domains of Masakado.\r\n\r\n*\"Gen\" is the alternative pronunciation of \"Minamoto\" as \"Hei\" is of\r\n\"Taira.\" The two great families who occupy such a large space in the\r\npages of Japanese history are spoken of together as \"Gen-Pei,\" and\r\nindependently as \"Genji\" and \"Heishi,\" or \"Minamoto\" and\r\n\r\nThe Fujiwara also had many provincial representatives, descended\r\nmainly from Hidesato, (called also Tawara Toda), who distinguished\r\nhimself in the Masakado crisis. There were the Sano-uji of\r\nShimotsuke, Mutsu, and Dewa; and there were the Kondo, the Muto, the\r\nKoyama, and the Yuki, all in different parts of the Kwanto. In fact,\r\nthe empire outside the capital was practically divided between the\r\nMinamoto, the Taira, and the Fujiwara families, so that anything like\r\na feud could scarcely fail to have wide ramifications.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh century may be said to have been the beginning of such\r\ntumults. Not long after the affair of Taira Tadatsune, there occurred\r\nthe much larger campaign known as Zen-kunen no Sodo, or the \"Prior\r\nNine Years' Commotion.\" The scene of this struggle was the vast\r\nprovince of Mutsu in the extreme north of the main island. For\r\nseveral generations the Abe family had exercised sway there, and its\r\nrepresentative in the middle of the eleventh century extended his\r\nrule over six districts and defied the authority of the provincial\r\ngovernors. The Court deputed Minamoto Yoriyoshi to restore order. The\r\nAbe magnate was killed by a stray arrow at an early stage of the\r\ncampaign, but his son, Sadato, made a splendid resistance.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1057, Yoriyoshi, at the head of eighteen hundred men,\r\nled a desperate assault on the castle of Kawasaki, garrisoned by\r\nSadato with four thousand picked soldiers. The attack was delivered\r\nduring a heavy snow-storm, and in its sequel the Minamoto general\r\nfound his force reduced to six men. Among these six, however, was his\r\neldest son, Yoshiiye, one of the most skilful bowmen Japan ever\r\nproduced. Yoshiiye's mother was a Taira. When she became enceinte her\r\nhusband dreamed that the sacred sword of the war deity, Hachiman, had\r\nbeen given to him, and the boy came to be called Hachiman Taro. This\r\nname grew to be a terror to the enemy, and it was mainly through his\r\nprowess that his father and their scanty remnant of troops escaped\r\nover roads where the snow lay several feet deep.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent occasion in the same campaign, Yoshiiye had Sadato at\r\nhis mercy and, while fixing an arrow to shoot him, composed the first\r\nline of a couplet, \"The surcoat's warp at last is torn.\" Sadato,\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation, capped the line, \"The threads at last\r\nare frayed and worn,\"* and Yoshiiye, charmed by such a display of\r\nready wit, lowered his bow. Nine years were needed to finish the\r\ncampaign, and, in its sequel, Yoriyoshi was appointed governor of\r\nIyo, and Yoshiiye, governor of Mutsu, while Kiyowara Takenori,\r\nwithout whose timely aid Sadato could scarcely have been subdued,\r\nreceived the high post of chinju-fu shogun (commandant of the local\r\nGovernment office). Yoshiiye's magnanimity towards Sadato at the\r\nfortress of Koromo-gawa has always been held worthy of a true bushi.\r\n\r\n*The point of this couplet is altogether lost in English. It turns\r\nupon the fact that the word tate used by Yoshiiye means either a\r\nfortress or the vertical threads in woven stuff, and that koromo was\r\nthe name of the fortress where the encounter took place and had also\r\nthe significance of \"surcoat.\"\r\n\r\nSadato was ultimately killed, but his younger brother Muneto had the\r\naffection and full confidence of Yoshiiye. Muneto, however,\r\nremembered his brother's fate and cherished a desire to take\r\nvengeance on Yoshiiye, which mood also was recognized as becoming to\r\na model bushi. One night, the two men went out together, and Muneto\r\ndecided that the opportunity for vengeance had come. Drawing his\r\nsword, he looked into the ox-carriage containing Yoshiiye and found\r\nhim sound asleep. The idea of behaving treacherously in the face of\r\nsuch trust was unendurable, and thereafter Muneto served Yoshiiye\r\nwith faith and friendship. The confidence that the Minamoto hero\r\nreposed in the brother of his old enemy and the way it was\r\nrequited--these, too, are claimed as traits of the bushi.\r\n\r\nYet another canon is furnished by Yoshiiye's career--the canon of\r\nhumility. Oye no Masafusa was overheard remarking that Yoshiiye had\r\nsome high qualities but was unfortunately ignorant of strategy. This\r\nbeing repeated to Yoshiiye, he showed no resentment but begged to\r\nbecome Masafusa's pupil. Yet he was already conqueror of the Abe and\r\ngovernor of Dewa.\r\n\r\nTHE GO-SANNEN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nThereafter the provinces of Mutsu and Dewa were again the scene of\r\nanother fierce struggle which, since it began in the third year\r\n(1089) of the Kwanji era and ended in the fifth year (1091), was\r\ncalled the \"After Three-years War.\" With regard to the nature of this\r\ncommotion, no enumeration of names is necessary. It was a family\r\nquarrel between the scions of Kiyowara Takenori, a magnate of Mutsu\r\nwho had rendered conclusive assistance to Yoshiiye in the Nine-years'\r\nWar; and as a great landowner of Dewa, Kimiko Hidetake, took part,\r\nthe whole north of Japan may be said to have been involved. It fell\r\nto Yoshiiye, as governor of Mutsu, to quell the disturbance, and very\r\ndifficult the task proved, so difficult that the issue might have\r\nbeen different had not Fujiwara Kiyohira--who will be presently\r\nspoken of--espoused the Minamoto cause.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the struggle reached Kyoto, Yoshiiye's younger brother,\r\nYoshimitsu, who held the much coveted post of kebiishi, applied for\r\npermission to proceed at once to his brother's assistance. The Court\r\nrefused his application, whereupon he resigned his office and, like a\r\ntrue bushi, hastened to the war. Yoshimitsu was a skilled performer\r\nupon a musical instrument called the sho. He had studied under a\r\ncelebrated master, Toyohara Tokimoto, now no more, and, on setting\r\nout for the field of battle in the far north, he became apprehensive\r\nlest the secrets imparted to him by his teacher should die with him.\r\nHe therefore invited Tokimoto's son, Tokiaki, to bear him company\r\nduring the first part of his journey, and to him he conveyed all the\r\nknowledge he possessed. The spectacle of this renowned soldier giving\r\ninstruction in the art of music to the son of his deceased teacher on\r\nmoonlit nights as he travelled towards the battlefield, has always\r\nappealed strongly to Japanese conception of a perfect samurai, and\r\nhas been the motive of many a picture.\r\n\r\nThis Go-sannen struggle furnished also another topic for frequent\r\npictorial representation. When about to attack the fortress of\r\nKanazawa, to which the approaches were very difficult, Yoshiiye\r\nobserved a flock of geese rising in confusion, and rightly inferred\r\nan ambuscade of the enemy. His comment was, \"Had not Oye Masafusa\r\ntaught me strategy, many brave men had been killed to-night.\" Yet one\r\nmore typical bushi may be mentioned in connexion with this war.\r\nKamakura Gongoro, a youth of sixteen, always fought in the van of\r\nYoshiiye's forces and did great execution. A general on the enemy's\r\nside succeeded in discharging a shaft which entered the boy's eye.\r\nGongoro, breaking the arrow, rode straight at the archer and cut him\r\ndown. A shrine in Kamakura was erected to the memory of this intrepid\r\nlad.\r\n\r\nWhen Yoshiiye reported to the Throne the issue of this sanguinary\r\nstruggle, Kyoto replied that the war had been a private feud and that\r\nno reward or distinctions would be conferred. Yoshiiye therefore\r\ndevoted the greater part of his own manors to recompensing those that\r\nhad followed his standard. He thus won universal respect throughout\r\nthe Kwanto. Men competed to place their sons and younger brothers as\r\nkenin (retainers) in his service and the name of Hachiman-ko was on\r\nall lips. But Yoshiiye died (1108) in a comparatively low rank. It is\r\neasy to comprehend that in the Kwanto it became a common saying,\r\n\"Better serve the Minamoto than the sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nTHE FUJIWARA OF THE NORTH\r\n\r\nFujiwara Kiyohira, who is mentioned above as having espoused the\r\ncause of the Minamoto in the Go-sannen, was descended from Hidesato,\r\nthe conqueror of Masakado. After the Go-sannen outbreak he succeeded\r\nto the six districts of Mutsu which had been held by the insurgent\r\nchiefs. This vast domain descended to his son Motohira, and to the\r\nlatter's son, Hidehira, whose name we shall presently find in large\r\nletters on a page of Japanese history.\r\n\r\nThe Mutsu branch of the Fujiwara wielded paramount sway in the north\r\nfor several generations. Near Hiraizumi, in the province of Rikuchu,\r\nmay still be seen four buildings forming the monastery Chuson-ji. In\r\none of these edifices repose the remains of Kiyohira, Motohira, and\r\nHidehira. The ceiling, floor and four walls of this Konjiki-do\r\n(golden hall) were originally covered with powdered gold, and its\r\ninterior pillars are inlaid with mother-of-pearl on which are traced\r\nthe outlines of twelve Arhats. In the days of Kiyohira the monastery\r\nconsisted of forty buildings and was inhabited by three hundred\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: A CONJUROR\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SIDE VIEW OF THE \"KOHO-AN\" OF DAITOKU-JI, AT KYOTO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nRECOVERY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY BY THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThe 69th Sovereign, the Emperor Go-Shujaku   A.D. 1037-1045\r\n\r\n    70th     \"             \"    Go-Reizei         1046-1068\r\n\r\n    71st     \"             \"    Go-Sanjo          1069-1072\r\n\r\n    72nd     \"             \"    Shirakawa         1073-1086\r\n\r\n    73rd     \"             \"    Horikawa          1087-1107\r\n\r\n    74th     \"             \"    Toba              1108-1123\r\n\r\n    75th     \"             \"    Sutoku            1124-1141\r\n\r\n    76th     \"             \"    Konoe             1142-1155\r\n\r\n    77th     \"             \"    Go-Shirakawa      1156-1158\r\n\r\nDECADENCE OF FUJIWARA AUTOCRACY\r\n\r\nDuring two centuries the administrative power remained in the hands\r\nof the Fujiwara. They lost it by their own timidity rather than\r\nthrough the machinations of their enemies. When the Emperor\r\nGo-Shujaku was mortally ill, he appointed his eldest son, Go-Reizei,\r\nto be his successor, and signified his desire that the latter's\r\nhalf-brother, Takahito, should be nominated Crown Prince. Fujiwara\r\nYorimichi was then regent (kwampaku). To him, also, the dying\r\nsovereign made known his wishes. Now Takahito had not been born of a\r\nFujiwara mother. The regent, therefore, while complying at once in\r\nGo-Reizei's case, said that the matter of the Crown Prince might be\r\ndeferred, his purpose being to wait until a Fujiwara lady should bear\r\na son to Go-Reizei.\r\n\r\nIn thus acting, Yorimichi obeyed the policy from which his family had\r\nnever swerved through many generations, and which had now become an\r\nunwritten law of the State. But his brother, Yoshinobu, read the\r\nsigns of the times in a sinister light. He argued that the real power\r\nhad passed to the military magnates, and that by attempting to stem\r\nthe current the Fujiwara might be swept away altogether. He therefore\r\nrepaired to the palace, and simulating ignorance of what had passed\r\nbetween the late sovereign and the kwampaku, inquired whether it was\r\nintended that Prince Takahito should enter a monastery. Go-Reizei\r\nreplied emphatically in the negative and related the facts, whereupon\r\nYoshinobu declared that the prince should be nominated forthwith. It\r\nwas done, and thus for the first time in a long series of years a\r\nsuccessor to the throne was proclaimed who had not the qualification\r\nof a Fujiwara mother.\r\n\r\nThere remained to the kwampaku only one way of expressing his\r\ndissent. During many years it had been customary that the Prince\r\nImperial, on his nomination, should receive from the Fujiwara regent\r\na famous sword called Tsubo-kiri (Jar-cutter). Yorimichi declined to\r\nmake the presentation in the case of Prince Takahito on the ground\r\nthat he was not of Fujiwara lineage. The prince--afterwards\r\nGo-Sanjo--had the courage to deride this omission. \"Of what service\r\nis the sword to me?\" he said. \"I have no need of it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch an attitude was very significant of the changing times. During\r\nmore than twenty years of probation as Crown Prince, this sovereign,\r\nGo-Sanjo, had ample opportunity of observing the arbitrary conduct of\r\nthe Fujiwara, and when he held the sceptre he neglected no means of\r\nasserting the authority of the Crown, one conspicuous step being to\r\ntake a daughter of Go-Ichijo into the palace as chugu, a position\r\ncreated for a Fujiwara and never previously occupied by any save a\r\nFujiwara.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Go-Sanjo stands an imposing figure in the annals of his\r\ncountry. Erudition he possessed in no small degree, and it was\r\nsupplemented by diligence, high moral courage and a sincere love of\r\njustice. He also set to his people an example of frugality. It is\r\nrelated that, observing as he passed through the streets one day, an\r\nox-carriage with gold mountings, he stopped his cortege and caused\r\nthe gold to be stripped off. Side by side with this record may be\r\nplaced his solicitude about the system of measures, which had fallen\r\ninto disorder. With his own hands he fashioned a standard which was\r\nknown to later generations as the senshi-masu of the Enkyu era\r\n(1069-1074). The question of tax-free manors (shoen) also received\r\nmuch attention. During the reign of Go-Shujaku, decrees were\r\nfrequently issued forbidding the creation of these estates. The\r\nFujiwara shoen were conspicuous. Michinaga possessed wide manors\r\neverywhere, and Yorimichi, his son, was not less insatiable. Neither\r\nGo-Shujaku nor Go-Reizei could check the abuse. But Go-Sanjo resorted\r\nto a really practical measure. He established a legislative office\r\nwhere all titles to shoen had to be examined and recorded, the Daiho\r\nsystem of State ownership being restored, so that all rights of\r\nprivate property required official sanction, the Court also becoming\r\nthe judge in all disputes as to validity of tenure.\r\n\r\nThese orders came like a clap of thunder in a blue sky. Many great\r\npersonages had acquired vast manorial tracts by processes that could\r\nnot endure the scrutiny of the Kiroku-jo (registrar's office).\r\nYorimichi, the kwampaku, was a conspicuous example. On receipt of the\r\norder to register, he could only reply that he had succeeded to his\r\nestates as they stood and that no documentary evidence was available.\r\nNevertheless, he frankly added that, if his titles were found\r\ninvalid, he was prepared to surrender his estates, since the position\r\nhe occupied required him to be an administrator of law, not an\r\nobstacle to its administration. This was the same noble who had\r\nrefused to present the sword, Tsubo-kiri, to Go-Sanjo when the latter\r\nwas nominated Crown Prince. The Emperor might now have exacted heavy\r\nreparation. But his Majesty shrank from anything like spoliation. A\r\nspecial decree was issued exempting from proof of title all manors\r\nheld by chancellors, regents, or their descendants.\r\n\r\nSALE OF OFFICES AND RANKS\r\n\r\nAnother abuse with which Go-Sanjo sought to deal drastically was the\r\nsale of offices and ranks. This was an evil of old standing. Whenever\r\nspecial funds were required for temple building or palace\r\nconstruction, it had become customary to invite contributions from\r\nlocal magnates, who, in return, received, or were renewed in their\r\ntenure of, the post of provincial governor. Official ranks were\r\nsimilarly disposed of. At what time this practice had its origin the\r\nrecords do not show, but during the reign of Kwammu (782-805,) the\r\nbestowal of rank in return for a money payment was interdicted, and\r\nMiyoshi Kiyotsura, in his celebrated memorial to Daigo (898-930),\r\nurged that the important office of kebiishi should never be conferred\r\nin consideration of money. But in the days of Ichijo, the acquisition\r\nof tax-free manors increased rapidly and the treasury's income\r\ndiminished correspondingly, so that it became inevitable, in times of\r\nState need, that recourse should be had to private contributions, the\r\ncontributors being held to have shown \"merit\" entitling them to rank\r\nor office or both.\r\n\r\nGo-Sanjo strictly interdicted all such transactions. But this action\r\nbrought him into sharp collision with the then kwampaku, Fujiwara\r\nNorimichi. The latter built within the enclosure of Kofuku-ji at Nara\r\nan octagonal edifice containing two colossal images of Kwannon. On\r\nthis nanen-do the regent spent a large sum, part of which was\r\ncontributed by the governor of the province. Norimichi therefore\r\napplied to the Emperor for an extension of the governor's term of\r\noffice. Go-Sanjo refused his assent. But Norimichi insisted. Finally\r\nthe Emperor, growing indignant, declared that the kwampaku's sole\r\ntitle to respect being derived from his maternal relationship to the\r\nsovereign, he deserved no consideration at the hands of an Emperor\r\nwhose mother was not a Fujiwara. It was a supreme moment in the\r\nfortunes of the Fujiwara. Norimichi angrily swept out of the\r\npresence, crying aloud: \"The divine influence of Kasuga Daimyojin*\r\nceases from to-day. Let every Fujiwara official follow me.\" Thereat\r\nall the Fujiwara courtiers flocked out of the palace, and the Emperor\r\nhad no choice but to yield. Victory rested with the Fujiwara, but it\r\nwas purchased at the loss of some prestige.\r\n\r\n*Titulary deity of the Fujiwara-uji.\r\n\r\nCAMERA SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\nTheir obviously selfish device of seating a minor on the throne and\r\nreplacing him as soon as he reached years of discretion, had been\r\ngradually invested by the Fujiwara with an element of spurious\r\naltruism. They had suggested the principle that the tenure of\r\nsovereign power should not be exercised exclusively. Go-Sanjo held,\r\nhowever, that such a system not only impaired the Imperial authority\r\nbut also was unnatural. No father, he argued, could be content to\r\ndivest himself of all practical interest in the affairs of his\r\nfamily, and to condemn the occupant of the throne to sit with folded\r\nhands was to reduce him to the rank of a puppet. Therefore, even\r\nthough a sovereign abdicated, he should continue to take an active\r\npart in the administration of State affairs. This was, in short,\r\nGo-Sanjo's plan for rendering the regent a superfluity. He proposed\r\nto substitute camera government (Insei) for control by a kwampaku.\r\nBut fate willed that he should not carry his project into practice.\r\nHe abdicated, owing to ill health, in 1073, and died the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSHIRAKAWA\r\n\r\nGo-Sanjo was succeeded by his eldest son, Shirakawa. He had taken for\r\nconsort the daughter of Fujiwara Yorimichi. This lady, Kenko, had\r\nbeen adopted into the family of Fujiwara Morozane, and it is recorded\r\nthat Yorimichi and Morozane shed tears of delight when they heard of\r\nher selection by the Crown Prince--so greatly had the influence of\r\nthe Fujiwara declined. Shirakawa modelled himself on his father. He\r\npersonally administered affairs of State, displaying assiduity and\r\nability but not justice. Unlike his father he allowed himself to be\r\nswayed by favour and affection, arbitrarily ignored time-honoured\r\nrules, and was guilty of great extravagance in matters of religion.\r\nBut he carried into full effect the camera (or cloistered) system of\r\ngovernment, thereafter known as Insei. For, in 1086, after thirteen\r\nyears' reign, he resigned the sceptre to an eight-year-old boy,\r\nHorikawa, his son by the chugu, Kenko. The untimely death of the\r\nlatter, for whom he entertained a strong affection, was the proximate\r\ncause of Shirakawa's abdication, but there can be little doubt that\r\nhe had always contemplated such a step. He took the tonsure and the\r\nreligious title of Ho-o (pontiff), but in the Toba palace, his new\r\nresidence, he organized an administrative machine on the exact lines\r\nof that of the Court.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KO-NO-MA (ROOM) NISHI (WEST) HONGWAN-JI TEMPLE, AT KYOTO\r\n(An example of \"Shoinzukuri\" building)\r\n\r\nThenceforth the functions of Imperialism were limited to matters of\r\netiquette and ceremony, all important State business being transacted\r\nby the Ho-o and his camera entourage. If the decrees of the Court\r\nclashed with those of the cloister, as was occasionally inevitable,\r\nthe former had to give way. Thus, it can scarcely be said that there\r\nwas any division of authority. But neither was there any progress.\r\nThe earnest efforts made by Go-Sanjo to check the abuse of sales of\r\nrank and office as well as the alienation of State lands into private\r\nmanors, were rendered wholly abortive under the sway of Shirakawa.\r\nThe cloistered Emperor was a slave of superstition. He caused no less\r\nthan six temples* to be built of special grandeur, and to the\r\nprincipal of these (Hosho-ji) he made frequent visits in state, on\r\nwhich occasions gorgeous ceremonies were performed. He erected the\r\nTemple of the 33,333 Images of Kwannon (the Sanjusangen-do) in Kyoto;\r\nhe made four progresses to the monastery at Koya and eight to that at\r\nKumano; he commissioned artists to paint 5470 Buddhist pictures,\r\nsculptors to cast 127 statues each sixteen feet high; 3150 life-size,\r\nand 2930 of three feet or less, and he raised twenty-one large\r\npagodas and 446,630 small ones.\r\n\r\n*These were designated Roku-sho-ji, or \"six excellent temples.\"\r\n\r\nHis respect for Buddhism was so extreme that he strictly interdicted\r\nthe taking of life in any form, a veto which involved the destruction\r\nof eight thousand fishing nets and the loss of their means of\r\nsustenance to innumerable fishermen, as well as the release of all\r\nfalcons kept for hawking. It has even been suggested that Shirakawa's\r\npiety amounted to a species of insanity, for, on one occasion, when\r\nrain prevented a contemplated progress to Hosho-ji, he sentenced the\r\nrain to imprisonment and caused a quantity to be confined in a\r\nvessel.* To the nation, however, all this meant something very much\r\nmore than a mere freak. It meant that the treasury was depleted and\r\nthat revenue had to be obtained by recourse to the abuses which\r\nGo-Sanjo had struggled so earnestly to check, the sale of offices and\r\nranks, even in perpetuity, and the inclusion of great tracts of State\r\nland in private manors.\r\n\r\n*This silliness was spoken of by the people as ame-kingoku (the\r\nincarceration of the rain).\r\n\r\nTOBA\r\n\r\nHorikawa died in 1107, after a reign of twenty years, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Toba, a child of five. Affairs of State\r\ncontinued to be directed by the cloistered sovereign, and he chose\r\nfor his grandson's consort Taiken-mon-in, who bore to him a son, the\r\nfuture Emperor Sutoku. Toba abdicated, after a reign of fifteen\r\nyears, on the very day of Sutoku's nomination as heir apparent, and,\r\nsix years later, Shirakawa died (1128), having administered the\r\nempire from the cloister during a space of forty-three years.\r\n\r\nAs a device to wrest the governing power from the grasp of the\r\nFujiwara, Go-Sanjo's plan was certainly successful, and had he lived\r\nto put it into operation himself, the results must have been\r\ndifferent. But in the greatly inferior hands of Shirakawa this new\r\ndivision of Imperial authority and the segregation of its source\r\nundoubtedly conspired to prepare the path for military feudalism and\r\nfor curtained Emperors.\r\n\r\nToba, with the title of Ho-o, took the tonsure and administered from\r\nthe cloister after Shirakawa's death. One of his first acts after\r\nabdication was to take another consort, a daughter of Fujiwara\r\nTadazane, whom he made Empress under the name of Kaya-no-in; but as\r\nshe bore him no offspring, he placed in the Toba palace a second\r\nFujiwara lady, Bifuku-mon-in, daughter of Nagazane. By her he had\r\n(1139) a son whom he caused to be adopted by the Empress, preparatory\r\nto placing him on the throne as Emperor Konoe, at the age of three.\r\nThus, the cloistered sovereigns followed faithfully in the footsteps\r\nof the Fujiwara.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER-PRIESTS\r\n\r\nA phenomenon which became conspicuous during the reign of Shirakawa\r\nwas recourse to violence by Buddhist priests. This abuse had its\r\norigin in the acquisition of large manors by temples and the\r\nconsequent employment of soldiers to act as guards. Ultimately, great\r\nmonasteries like Kofuku-ji, Onjo-ji, and Enryaku-ji came to possess\r\nthousands of these armed men, and consequently wielded temporal\r\npower. Shirakawa's absorbing belief in Buddhism created opportunities\r\nfor the exercise of this influence. Keenly anxious that a son should\r\nbe born of his union with Kenko, the daughter of Fujiwara Yorimichi,\r\nhis Majesty bespoke the prayers of Raigo, lord-abbot of Onjo-ji. It\r\nhappened that unsuccessful application had frequently been made by\r\nthe Onjo-ji monks for an important religious privilege. Raigo\r\ninformed the Emperor that, if this favour were promised, the prayer\r\nfor a prince would certainly be heard. Shirakawa made the promise,\r\nand Kenko gave birth to Prince Atsubumi. But when the Emperor would\r\nhave fulfilled his pledge, the priests of Enryaku-ji (Hiei-zan),\r\njealous that a privilege which they alone possessed should be granted\r\nto priests of another monastery, repaired to the Court en masse to\r\nprotest. Shirakuwu yielded to this representation and despatched Oye\r\nno Masafusa to placate Raigo. But the abbot refused to listen. He\r\nstarved himself to death, passing day and night in devotion, and\r\nshortly after his demise the little prince, born in answer to his\r\nprayers, died of small-pox.\r\n\r\nIn an age when superstition prevailed widely the death of the child\r\nwas, of course, attributed to the incantations of the abbot. From\r\nthat time a fierce feud raged between Onjo-ji and Enryaku-ji. In the\r\nyear 1081, the priest-soldiers of the latter set the torch to the\r\nformer, and, flocking to Kyoto in thousands, threw the capital into\r\ndisorder. Order was with difficulty restored through the exertions of\r\nthe kebiishi and the two Minamoto magnates, Yoshiiye and Yoshitsuna,\r\nbut it was deemed expedient to guard the palace and the person of\r\nthe Emperor with bushi. Twelve years later (1093), thousands of\r\ncenobites, carrying the sacred tree of the Kasuga shrine, marched\r\nfrom Nara to Kyoto, clamouring for vengeance on the governor of\r\nOmi, whom they charged with arresting and killing the officials\r\nof the shrine. This became a precedent. Thereafter, whenever the\r\npriests had a grievance, they flocked to the palace carrying the\r\nsacred tree of some temple or shrine. The soldier cenobites of\r\nEnryaku-ji--yama-hoshi, as they were called--showed themselves\r\nnotably turbulent. They inaugurated the device of replacing the\r\nsacred tree with the \"divine car,\" against which none dare raise a\r\nhand or shoot an arrow. If their petition were rejected, they would\r\nabandon the car in the streets of the capital, thus placing the city\r\nunder a curse.\r\n\r\nA notable instance occurred, in 1095, when these yama-hoshi of\r\nHiyoshi preferred a charge of blood-guiltiness against Minamoto\r\nYoshitsuna, governor of Mino. They flocked to the palace in a\r\ntruculent mob, but the bushi on duty, being under the command of a\r\nMinamoto, did not hesitate to use their bows. Thereupon the\r\nyama-hoshi discarded the divine car, hastened back to the temple, and\r\nassembling all the priests, held a solemn service invoking the wrath\r\nof heaven on the State. In an age of profound superstition such\r\naction threw the Court into consternation, and infinite pains were\r\ntaken to persuade Shinto officials of an independent shrine to carry\r\nthe divine car back to Hiei-zan.\r\n\r\nInstances of such turbulence were not infrequent, and they account in\r\npart for the reckless prodigality shown by Shirakawa in building and\r\nfurnishing temples. The cenobites did not confine themselves to\r\ndemonstrations at the palace; they had their own quarrels also.\r\nKofuku-ji's hand was against Kimbusen and Todai-ji, and not a few\r\npriests doffed the stole and cassock to engage in temporary\r\nbrigandage. The great Taira leader, Tadamori, and his son,\r\nKiyomori--one of the most prominent figures on the stage of medieval\r\nJapan--dealt strongly with the Shinto communities at Hiyoshi and\r\nGion, and drove the Kofuku-ji priests out of the streets of Kyoto,\r\nthe result being that this great military family became an object of\r\nexecration at Kofuku-ji and Enryaku-ji alike. With difficulty the\r\nCourt kept peace between them. It is related of Shirakawa Ho-o that\r\nthe three things which he declared to defy his control were the\r\nwaters of the Kamo River, the fall of the dice, and the yama-hoshi.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PLAYING BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK (From a painting)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE HEIAN EPOCH\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTHE period we are considering is a long one which owes its unity to\r\nthe sole fact that the capitol was at Kyoto. It is, therefore, unsafe\r\nto generalize on its manners and customs. But we may say with a\r\ndegree of accuracy that the epoch was marked by an increasing luxury\r\nand artificiality, due largely to the adoption of Chinese customs.\r\nThe capital city was built on a Chinese pattern and the salient\r\ncharacteristics of the Court during the period named from the new\r\ncapital are on the Chinese pattern too. The Chinese idea of a civil\r\nservice in which worth was tested by examinations was carried to a\r\npedantic extreme both in administration and in society. In these\r\nexaminations the important paper was in Chinese prose composition,\r\nwhich was much as if Latin prose were the main subject to prove the\r\nfitness of a candidate for an English or American administrative\r\npost! And the tests of social standing and the means of gaining fame\r\nat Court were skill in verse-writing, in music and dancing, in\r\ncalligraphy and other forms of drawing, and in taste in landscape\r\ngardening.\r\n\r\nIchijo was famed as a musician and a prose writer, and Saga as a\r\ncalligraphist. The Ako incident (see p. 240) illustrates the lengths\r\nto which pedantry was carried in matters of administration. And the\r\nstory of the ill-success at the capital of the young soldier Taira\r\nMasakado, contrasted with the popularity of his showily vicious\r\nkinsman Sadabumi (see p. 253), illustrate what Murdoch means when he\r\nsays that the early emperors of the Heian epoch had an \"unbalanced\r\ncraze for Chinese fashions, for Chinese manners, and above all for\r\nChinese literature.\" Remarkable though the power of the Japanese\r\npeople always seems to have been to assimilate foreign culture in\r\nlarge doses and speedily, it is hardly to be expected that at this\r\nperiod, any more than at a later one when there came in a sudden\r\nflood of European civilization, the nation should not have suffered\r\nsomewhat--that it should not have had the defects of its qualities.\r\n\r\nLUXURY OF THE COURT\r\n\r\nOf Nimmyo's luxury and architectural extravagance we have already\r\nspoken, and of the arraignment of prodigality in dress, banquets, and\r\nfunerals in the famous report of Miyoshi Kiyotsura (see p. 246).\r\nIndeed, we might almost cite the madness of the Emperor Yozei as\r\nbeing a typical, though extreme, case of the hysteria of the young\r\nand affected court nobles. Two of the Fujiwara have been pilloried in\r\nnative records for ostentation: one for carrying inside his clothes\r\nhot rice-dumplings to keep himself warm, and, more important, to\r\nfling them away one after another as they got cold; and the other for\r\ncarrying a fan decorated with a painting of a cuckoo and for\r\nimitating the cuckoo's cry whenever he opened the fan.\r\n\r\nCONVENTION AND MORALITY\r\n\r\nIf the men of the period were effeminate and emotional, the women\r\nseem to have sunk to a lower stage of morals than in any other era,\r\nand sexual morality and wifely fidelity to have been abnormally bad\r\nand lightly esteemed. The story of Ariwara Narihira, prince, poet,\r\npainter and Don Juan, and of Taka and her rise to power (see p. 238)\r\nhas already been told; and it is to be noted that the Fujiwara\r\nworking for the control of the Throne through Imperial consorts\r\ninduced, even forced, the Emperors to set a bad example in such\r\nmatters. But over all this vice there was a veneer of elaborate\r\netiquette. Even in the field a breach of etiquette was a deadly\r\ninsult: as we have seen (p. 254) Taira Masakado lost the aid of a\r\ngreat lieutenant in his revolt because he forgot to bind up his hair\r\nproperly before he received a visitor. At Court, etiquette and\r\nceremony became the only functions of the nominal monarch after the\r\ncamera government of the cloistered ex-Emperors had begun. And\r\naristocratic women, though they might be notoriously unfaithful, kept\r\nup a show of modesty, covering their faces in public, refusing to\r\nspeak to a stranger, going abroad in closed carriages or heavily\r\nveiled with hoods, and talking to men with their faces hid by a fan,\r\na screen, or a sliding door, these degrees of intimacy being nicely\r\nadjusted to the rank and station of the person addressed. Love-making\r\nand wooing were governed by strict and conventional etiquette, and an\r\ninterchange of letters of a very literary and artificial type and of\r\npoems usually took the place of personal meetings. Indeed, literary\r\nskill and appreciation of Chinese poetry and art were the main things\r\nsought for in a wife.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ARIWARA NARIHARA (Poet and Painter)\r\n\r\nAMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe pastimes of Court society in these years differed not so much in\r\nkind as in degree from those of the Nara epoch. In amusement, as in\r\nall else, there was extravagance and elaboration. What has already\r\nbeen said of the passion for literature would lead us to expect to\r\nfind in the period an extreme development of the couplet-tournament\r\n(uta awase) which had had a certain vogue in the Nara epoch and was\r\nnow a furore at Court. The Emperor Koko and other Emperors in the\r\nfirst half of the Heian epoch gave splendid verse-making parties,\r\nwhen the palace was richly decorated, often with beautiful flowers.\r\nIn this earlier part of the period the gentlemen and ladies of the\r\nCourt were separated, sitting on opposite sides of the room in which\r\nthe party was held. Later in the Heian epoch the composition of love\r\nletters was a favorite competitive amusement, and although canons of\r\nelegant phraseology were implicitly followed, the actual contents of\r\nthese fictitious letters were frankly indecent.\r\n\r\nOther literary pastimes were: \"incense-comparing,\" a combination of\r\npoetical dilletantism and skill in recognizing the fragrance of\r\ndifferent kinds of incense burned separately or in different\r\ncombinations; supplying famous stanzas of which only a word or so was\r\ngiven; making riddles in verse; writing verse or drawing pictures on\r\nfans,--testing literary and artistic skill; and making up lists of\r\nrelated ideographs. The love of flowers was carried to extravagant\r\nlengths. The camera Court in particular organized magnificent picnics\r\nto see the cherry-trees of Hosho-ji and the snowy forest at Koya.\r\nThere were spring festivals of sunrise at Sagano and autumn moonlight\r\nexcursions to the Oi River. The taste of the time was typified in\r\nsuch vagaries as covering trees with artificial flowers in winter and\r\nin piling up snow so that some traces of snowy landscapes might still\r\nbe seen in spring or summer. Such excess reminds the student of\r\ndecadent Rome as portrayed by the great Latin satirists.\r\n\r\nOther favorite amusements at Court were: gathering sweet-flag in\r\nsummer and comparing the length of its roots, hawking, fan-lotteries,\r\na kind of backgammon called sugoroku, and different forms of\r\ngambling. Football was played, a Chinese game in which the winner was\r\nhe who kicked the ball highest and kept it longest from touching the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAnother rage was keeping animals as pets, especially cats and dogs,\r\nwhich received human names and official titles and, when they died,\r\nelaborate funerals. Kittens born at the palace at the close of the\r\ntenth century were treated with consideration comparable to that\r\nbestowed on Imperial infants. To the cat-mother the courtiers sent\r\nthe ceremonial presents after childbirth, and one of the\r\nladies-in-waiting was honoured by an appointment as guardian to the\r\nyoung kittens.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SKETCH OF \"SHINDENZUKUBI\" (Style of Dwelling House of\r\nNobles in the Heian Epoch)\r\n\r\nMUSIC AND DANCING\r\n\r\nWith the growth of luxury in the Heian epoch and the increase of\r\nextravagant entertainment and amusement, there was a remarkable\r\ndevelopment of music and the dance. Besides the six-stringed harp or\r\nwagon, much more complex harps or lutes of thirteen or twenty-five\r\nstrings were used, and in general there was a great increase in the\r\nnumber and variety of instruments. Indeed, we may list as many as\r\ntwenty kinds of musical instruments and three or four times as many\r\nvarieties of dance in the Heian epoch. Most of the dances were\r\nforeign in their origin, some being Hindu, more Korean, and still\r\nmore Chinese, according to the usual classification. But imported\r\ndances, adaptations of foreign dances, and the older native styles\r\nwere all more or less pantomimic.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPE GARDENING\r\n\r\nExcept in the new capital city with its formal plan there were no\r\ngreat innovations in architecture. Parks around large houses and\r\nwillows and cherry-trees planted along the streets of Kyoto relieved\r\nthis stiffness of the great city. Landscape-gardening became an art.\r\nGardens were laid out in front of the row of buildings that made up\r\nthe home of each noble or Court official.\r\n\r\nConvention was nearly as rigid here as it was in Court etiquette. In\r\nthe centre of this formal garden was a miniature lake with bridges\r\nleading to an island; there was a waterfall feeding the lake, usually\r\nat its southern end; and at the eastern and western limits of the\r\ngarden, respectively, a grotto for angling and a \"hermitage of spring\r\nwater\"--a sort of picnic ground frequented on summer evenings. The\r\ngreat artist, Kanaoka, of the end of the ninth century worked at\r\nlaying out these rockeries and tiny parks. A native school of\r\narchitects, or more correctly carpenters, had arisen in the province\r\nof Hida. There was less temple building than in the Nara epoch and\r\nmore attention was given to the construction of elegant palaces for\r\ncourt officials and nobles. But these were built of wood and were far\r\nfrom being massive or imposing. As in other periods of Japanese\r\narchitecture, the exterior was sacrificed to the interior where there\r\nwere choice woodworking and joinery in beautiful woods, and\r\noccasionally screen-or wall-painting as decoration. There was still\r\nlittle house-furnishing. Mats (tatami), fitted together so as to\r\ncover the floor evenly, were not used until the very close of the\r\nperiod; and then, too, sliding doors began to be used as partitions.\r\nThe coverings of these doors, silk or paper, were the \"walls\" for\r\nJapanese mural paintings of the period. As the tatami came into more\r\ngeneral use, the bedstead of the earlier period, which was itself a\r\nlow dais covered with mats and with posts on which curtains and nets\r\nmight be hung, went out of use, being replaced by silken quilts\r\nspread on the floor-mats. Cushions and arm-rests were the only other\r\nimportant pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nCOSTUME\r\n\r\nIn the Heian epoch, Court costume was marked by the two\r\ncharacteristics that we have seen elsewhere in the\r\nperiod--extravagance and convention. Indeed, it may be said that\r\nChinese dress and etiquette, introduced after the time of Kwammu were\r\nthe main source of the luxury of the period. Costume was extreme, not\r\nalone in being rich and costly, but in amount of material used.\r\nPrincely and military head-dresses were costly, jewelled, and\r\nenormously tall, and women wore their hair, if possible, so that it\r\ntrailed below their elaborate skirts. Men's sleeves and trousers were\r\ncut absurdly large and full; and women's dress was not merely baggy\r\nbut voluminous. At a palace fete in 1117 the extreme of elegance was\r\nreached by ladies each wearing a score or so of different coloured\r\nrobes. In this period the use of costly and gorgeous brocades and\r\nsilks with beautiful patterns and splendid embroideries began.\r\n\r\nWomen at Court, and the Court dandies who imitated them, painted\r\nartificial eye-brows high on the forehead, shaving or plucking out\r\nthe real brows, powdered and rouged their faces and stained their\r\nteeth black.\r\n\r\nART\r\n\r\nCeramics did not advance in the Heian epoch, but in all other\r\nbranches of art there were rapid strides forward. The development of\r\ninterior decoration in temples, monasteries, and palaces was due to\r\nprogress on the part of lacquerers and painters. Gold lacquer,\r\nlacquer with a gold-dust surface (called nashi-ji), and lacquer\r\ninlaid with mother-of-pearl were increasingly used. Thanks in part to\r\nthe painters' bureau (E-dokoro) in the palace, Japanese painters\r\nbegan to be ranked with their Chinese teachers. Koze Kanaoka was the\r\nfirst to be thus honored, and it is on record that he was engaged to\r\npaint figures of arhats on the sliding doors of the palace. The epoch\r\nalso boasted Fujiwara Tameuji, founder of the Takuma family of\r\nartists, and Fujiwara Motomitsu, founder of the Tosa academy. The\r\nsculpture of the time showed greater skill, but less grandeur of\r\nconception, than the work of the Nara masters. Sculpture in wood was\r\nimportant, dating especially from the 11th century. Jocho, possibly\r\nthe greatest of the workers in this medium, followed Chinese models,\r\nand carved a famous Buddha for Michinaga's temple of Hosho-ji (1022).\r\nJocho's descendant Unkei was the ancestor of many busshi or sculptors\r\nof Buddhist statues; and Kwaikei, a pupil of Unkei's brother Jokaku,\r\nis supposed to have collaborated with Unkei on the great\r\ngate-guardians of the Todai-ji temple. It is important to note that,\r\nespecially in the latter half of the Heian epoch, painters and\r\nsculptors were usually men of good family. Art had become\r\nfashionable.\r\n\r\nTwo minor forms of sculpture call for special attention. The\r\ndecoration of armour reached a high pitch of elaboration; and the\r\nbeautiful armour of Minamoto Yoshitsune is still preserved at Kasuga,\r\nNara. And masks to be used in mimetic dances, such as the No,\r\nreceived attention from many great glyptic artists.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: RAKAN (BUDDHIST DISCIPLE) (Carving in Stone at Horiuji)\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nIn the year 799, cotton-seed, carried by an Indian junk which drifted\r\nto the coast of Mikawa, was sown in the provinces of Nankai-do and\r\nSaikai-do, and fifteen years later, when Saga reigned, tea plants\r\nwere brought from overseas and were set out in several provinces. The\r\nEmperor Nimmyo (834-850) had buckwheat sown in the home provinces\r\n(Kinai), and the same sovereign encouraged the cultivation of\r\nsorghum, panic-grass, barley, wheat, large white beans, small red\r\nbeans, and sesame. It was at this time that the ina-hata (paddy-loom)\r\nwas devised for drying sheaves of rice before winnowing. Although it\r\nwas a very simple implement, it nevertheless proved of such great\r\nvalue that an Imperial command was issued urging its wide use. In\r\nshort, in the early years of the Heian epoch, the Throne took an\r\nactive part in promoting agriculture, but this wholesome interest\r\ngradually declined in proportion to the extension of tax-free manors\r\n(shoen).\r\n\r\nTRADE\r\n\r\nThe story of trade resembled that of agriculture prosperous\r\ndevelopment at the beginning of the era, followed by stagnation and\r\ndecline. Under Kwummu (782-805) and his immediate successors, canals\r\nand roads were opened, irrigation works were undertaken, and coins\r\nwere frequently cast. But coins were slow in finding their way into\r\ncirculation, and taxes were generally paid in kind. Nevertheless, for\r\npurposes of trade, prices of staples were fixed in terms of coin.\r\nThus in the year 996, a koku (about 5 bushels) of rice was the\r\nequivalent of 1000 cash (ik-kan-mon); a koku of barley was valued at\r\n2500 cash, and a hiki (25 yards) of silk at 2000 cash. Yet in actual\r\npractice, commodities were often assessed in terms of silk or rice.\r\nGoods were packed in stores (kura) or disposed on shelves in shops\r\n(machi-ya), and at ports where merchantmen assembled there were\r\nhouses called tsuya (afterwards toiya) where wholesale transactions\r\nwere conducted on the commission system.\r\n\r\nThe city of Kyoto was divided into two parts, an eastern capital\r\n(Tokyo) and a western capital (Saikyo). During the first half of\r\nevery month all commercial transactions were conducted in the eastern\r\ncapital, where fifty-one kinds of commodities were sold in fifty-one\r\nshops; and during the second half the western capital alone was\r\nfrequented, with its thirty-three shops and thirty-three classes of\r\ngoods. After the abolition of embassies to China, at the close of the\r\nninth century, oversea trade declined for a time. But the inhabitants\r\nof Tsukushi and Naniwa, which were favourably located for voyages,\r\ncontinued to visit China and Korea, whence they are reported to have\r\nobtained articles of value. Other ports frequented by foreign-going\r\nships were Kanzaki, Eguchi, Kaya, Otsu, and Hakata.\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITION\r\n\r\nTurning to the inner life of the people in the Heian epoch, we may\r\nsay with little fear of exaggeration that the most notable thing was\r\nthe increase of superstition. This was due in part at least to the\r\ngrowth in Japan of the power of Buddhism, and, be it understood, of\r\nBuddhism of a degraded and debased form. The effort to combine\r\nBuddhism and Shinto probably robbed the latter of any power it might\r\notherwise have had to withstand superstition. Although men of the\r\ngreatest ability went into the Buddhist monasteries, including many\r\nImperial princes, their eminence did not make them better leaders and\r\nguides of the people, but rather aided them in misleading and\r\nbefooling the laity. Murdoch in speaking of the beginning of the 12th\r\ncentury says: \"At this date, Buddhism in Japan from a moral point of\r\nview was in not a whit better case than was the Church of Rome\r\nbetween the death of Sylvester II and the election of Leo IX.\" An\r\ninteresting parallel might be drawn between Japanese and European\r\nsuperstition, as each was consequent on the low standards of the\r\nclergy of the times. The famous report of Miyoshi Kiyotsura, to which\r\nwe have so often alluded, spoke in no measured terms of the greed and\r\nvice of the Buddhist priests. And the character of these hireling\r\nshepherds goes far to explain the gross superstition of the tune. We\r\nhave told (p. 274) the story of the abbot Raigo and how the Court was\r\nforced to purchase from him intercessory prayers for the birth of an\r\nheir,--and of the death of the heir in apparent consequence of\r\nRaigo's displeasure. Near the end of the ninth century one Emperor\r\nmade a gift of 500,000 yen for prayers that seemed to have saved the\r\nlife of a favourite minister. Prayers for rain, for prolonged life,\r\nfor victory over an enemy, were implicitly believed to be efficient,\r\nand priests received large bribes to make these prayers. Or they\r\nreceived other rewards: the privilege of coming to Court in a\r\ncarriage was granted to one priest for bringing rain after a long\r\ndrought and to another for saving the life of a sick prince in 981.\r\nAs men got along in years they had masses said for the prolongation\r\nof their lives,--with an increase in the premium each year for such\r\nlife insurance. Thus, at forty, a man had masses said in forty\r\nshrines, but ten years later at fifty shrines in all.\r\n\r\nIn this matter, as in others, the influence of the Fujiwara was\r\ngreat. They were in a close alliance with the priests, and they\r\ncontrolled the Throne through consorts and kept the people in check\r\nthrough priests and superstitions.\r\n\r\nWith the widespread belief in the power of priestly prayer there was\r\nprevalent a fear of spirits and demons. Oda received a promise in a\r\ndream that he would become Emperor. In the next generation the\r\nEmperor Daigo exiled Sugawara Michizane to Kyusml, where the exile\r\ndied in two years. Soon afterwards the Emperor fell sick; and this,\r\nthe disaster of 930 when a thunderstorm killed many nobles in the\r\nImperial palace, and the sudden death of Michizane's accusers and of\r\nthe Crown Prince were explained as due to the ill-will of the injured\r\nman's spirit. His titles were restored and everything possible was\r\ndone to placate the ghost (see p. 244). To an earlier period belongs\r\nthe similar story of Kwammu and his efforts to placate the spirit of\r\nhis younger brother whom he had exiled and killed. Kwammu, fearing\r\nthat death was coming upon him, built a temple to the shade of this\r\nbrother. A cloud over the palace of another Emperor was interpreted\r\nas a portentous monster, half monkey and half snake, and one of the\r\nMinamoto warriors won fame for his daring in shooting an arrow at the\r\ncloud, which then vanished. Equally foolhardy and marvellous was the\r\ndeed of Fujiwara Michinaga, who alone of a band of courtiers in the\r\npalace dared one dark night to go unattended and without lights from\r\none end of the palace to the other.\r\n\r\nWhen the new city of Kyoto was built, a Buddhist temple was put near\r\nthe northeast gate to protect the capital from demons, since the\r\nnortheast quarter of the sky belonged to the demons; and on a hill a\r\nclay statue was erected, eight feet high and armed with bow, arrows\r\nand cuirass, to guard the city. So implicit was the belief in the\r\npower of this colossal charm that it was said that it moved and\r\nshouted to warn the city of danger.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: EARTHEN-WARE HOUSE FOR ORNAMENT\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, no organized system of schools in this period,\r\nbut education was not neglected. A university was established in the\r\nnewly built capital, and there were five family schools or academies\r\nfor the youth of the separate uji. A school and hospital, founded by\r\nFujiwara Fuyutsugu in 825, received an Imperial endowment. At almost\r\nexactly the same time (823) the Bunsho-in was founded by Sugawara.\r\nThe Sogaku-in was founded in 831 by Arihara Yukihara. In 850 the\r\nconsort of the emperor Saga built the Gakkwan-in for the Tachibana\r\nfamily; and in 841 the palace of Junna became a school. And there was\r\none quasi-public school, opened in 828, in the Toji monastery south\r\nof the capital, which was not limited to any family and was open to\r\ncommoners.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: NETSUKE (Hand-carvings in Ivory)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ARCHERY IN OLD JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EPOCH OF THE GEN (MINAMOTO) AND THE HEI (TAIRA)\r\n\r\nSUPREMACY OF THE MILITARY CLASS\r\n\r\nDESCRIBED superficially, the salient distinction between the epochs\r\nof the Fujiwara and the Gen-pei was that during the former the\r\nadministrative power lay in the hands of the Court nobles in Kyoto,\r\nwhereas, during the latter, it lay in the hands of the military\r\nmagnates in the provinces. The processes by which this change was\r\nevolved have already been explained in part and will be further\r\nelucidated as we advance. Here, however, it is advisable to note that\r\nthis transfer of authority was, in one sense, a substitution of\r\nnative civilization for foreign, and, in another, a reversion to the\r\nconditions that had existed at the time of the Yamato conquest. It\r\nwas a substitution of native civilization for foreign, because the\r\nexotic culture imported from China and Korea had found its chief\r\nfield of growth in the capital and had never extended largely to the\r\nprovinces; and it was a reversion to the conditions existing at the\r\ntime of the Yamato conquest, because at that time the sword and the\r\nsceptre had been one.\r\n\r\nThe Mononobe and the Otomo families constituted the pillars of the\r\nState under the early Emperors. Their respective ancestors were\r\nUmashimade no Mikoto and Michi no Omi no Mikoto. The Japanese term\r\nmonobe (or mononofu) was expressed by Chinese ideographs having the\r\nsound, bushi. Thus, though it is not possible to fix the exact date\r\nwhen the expression, bushi, came into general use, it is possible to\r\nbe sure that the thing itself existed from time immemorial. When the\r\nYamato sovereign undertook his eastward expedition, Umashimade with\r\nhis monobe subdued the central districts, and Michi no Omi with his\r\notomo and Okume-be consolidated these conquests. Thereafter the\r\nmonobe were organized into the konoe-fu (palace guards) and the otomo\r\ninto the emon-fu (gate guards). Not military matters alone, but also\r\ncriminal jurisdiction, belonged to the functions of these two.\r\n\r\nTHE BUSHI\r\n\r\nThe earliest type of the Yamato race having thus been military, it\r\nbecomes important to inquire what tenets constituted the soldier's\r\ncode in old Japan. Our first guide is the celebrated anthology,\r\nManyo-shu, compiled in the ninth century and containing some poems\r\nthat date from the sixth. From this we learn that the Yamato\r\nmonono-fu believed himself to have inherited the duty of dying for\r\nhis sovereign if occasion required. In that cause he must be prepared\r\nat all times to find a grave, whether upon the desolate moor or in\r\nthe stormy sea. The dictates of filial piety ranked next in the\r\nethical scale. The soldier was required to remember that his body had\r\nbeen given to him by his parents, and that he must never bring\r\ndisgrace upon his family name or ever disregard the dictates of\r\nhonour. Loyalty to the Throne, however, took precedence among moral\r\nobligations. Parent, wife, and child must all be abandoned at the\r\ncall of patriotism. Such, as revealed in the pages of the Myriad\r\nLeaves, were the simple ethics of the early Japanese soldier. And it\r\nwas largely from the Mononobe and Otomo families that high officials\r\nand responsible administrators were chosen at the outset.\r\n\r\nWhen Buddhism arrived in the sixth century, we have seen that it\r\nencountered resolute opposition at the hands of Moriya, the o-muraji\r\nof the Mononobe family. That was natural. The elevation of an alien\r\ndeity to a pedestal above the head of the ancestral Kami seemed\r\nspecially shocking to the soldier class. But the tendency of the time\r\nwas against conservatism. The Mononobe and the Otomo forfeited their\r\nposition, and the Soga stepped into their place, only to be succeeded\r\nin turn by the Fujiwara. These last, earnest disciples of Chinese\r\ncivilization, looked down on the soldier, and delegated to him alone\r\nthe use of brute force and control of the criminal classes, reserving\r\nfor themselves the management of civil government and the pursuit of\r\nliterature, and even leaving politics and law in the hands of the\r\nschoolmen.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the military families of Minamoto (Gen) and\r\nTaira (Hei), performing the duties of guards and of police, gradually\r\nacquired influence; were trusted by the Court on all occasions\r\ndemanding an appeal to force, and spared no pains to develop the\r\nqualities that distinguished them--the qualities of the bushi. Thus,\r\nas we turn the pages of history, we find the ethics of the soldier\r\ndeveloping into a recognized code. His sword becomes an object of\r\nprofound veneration from the days of Minamoto Mitsunaka, who summons\r\na skilled swordsmith to the capital and entrusts to him the task of\r\nforging two blades, which, after seven days of fasting and prayer and\r\nsixty days of tempering, emerge so trenchant that they are thereafter\r\nhanded down from generation to generation of the Minamoto as\r\ntreasured heirlooms.*\r\n\r\n*The swords were named \"Knee-cutter\" and \"Beard-cutter,\" because when\r\ntested for decapitating criminals, they severed not only the necks\r\nbut also the beard and the knees.\r\n\r\nThat the bushi's word must be sacred and irrevocable is established\r\nby the conduct of Minamoto Yorinobu who, having promised to save the\r\nlife of a bandit if the latter restore a child taken as a hostage,\r\nrefuses subsequently to inflict any punishment whatever on the\r\nrobber. That a bushi must prefer death to surrender is a principle\r\nobserved in thousands of cases, and that his family name must be\r\ncarefully guarded against every shadow of reproach is proved by his\r\nhabit of prefacing a duel on the battle-field with a recitation of\r\nthe titles and deeds of his ancestors. To hold to his purpose in\r\nspite of evil report; to rise superior to poverty and hardship; not\r\nto rest until vengeance is exacted for wrong done to a benefactor or\r\na relation; never to draw his sword except in deadly earnest--these\r\nare all familiar features of the bushi's practice, though the order\r\nand times of their evolution cannot be precisely traced.\r\n\r\nEven more characteristic is the quality called fudoshin, or\r\nimmobility of heart. That this existed in practice from an early era\r\ncannot be doubted, but its cultivation by a recognized system of\r\ntraining dates from the beginning of the thirteenth century, when the\r\nintrospective tenet (kwanshin-ho) of the Zen sect of Buddhism taught\r\nbelievers to divest themselves wholly of passion and emotion and to\r\neducate a mind unmoved by its environment, so that, in the storm and\r\nstress of battle, the bushi remains as calm and as self-possessed as\r\nin the quietude of the council chamber or the sacred stillness of the\r\ncloister. The crown of all his qualities was self-respect. He rated\r\nhimself too high to descend to petty quarrels, or to make the\r\nacquisition of rank his purpose, or to have any regard for money.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ART\r\n\r\nAs for tactics, individual prowess was the beginning and the end of\r\nall contests, and strategy consisted mainly of deceptions, surprises,\r\nand ambushes. There were, indeed, certain recognized principles\r\nderived from treatises compiled by Sung and 'Ng,* two Chinese\r\ngenerals of the third century A.D. These laid down that troops for\r\noffensive operations in the field must be twice as numerous as the\r\nenemy; those for investing a fortress should be to the garrison as\r\nten to one, and those for escalade as five to one. Outflanking\r\nmethods were always to be pursued against an adversary holding high\r\nground, and the aim should be to sever the communications of an army\r\nhaving a mountain or a river on its rear. When the enemy selected a\r\nposition involving victory or death, he was to be held, not attacked,\r\nand when it was possible to surround a foe, one avenue of escape\r\nshould always be left to him, since desperate men fight fiercely. In\r\ncrossing a river, much space should separate the van from the rear of\r\nthe crossing army, and an enemy crossing was not to be attacked until\r\nhis forces had become well engaged in the operation. Birds soaring in\r\nalarm should suggest an ambush, and beasts breaking cover, an\r\napproaching attack. There was much spying. A soldier who could win\r\nthe trust of the enemy, sojourn in his midst, and create dissensions\r\nin his camp, was called a hero.\r\n\r\n*See Captain Calthrop's The Book of War.\r\n\r\nJudged by this code of precepts, the old-time soldier of the East\r\nhas been denounced by some critics as representing the lowest\r\ntype of military ethics. But such a criticism is romantic. The\r\nsecret-intelligence department of a twentieth-century army employs\r\nand creates opportunities just as zealously as did the disciples of\r\nSung and 'Ng. It is not here that the defects in the bushi's ethics\r\nmust be sought. The most prominent of those defects was indifference\r\nto the rights of the individual. Bushido taught a vassal to sacrifice\r\nhis own interest and his own life on the altar of loyalty, but it did\r\nnot teach a ruler to recognize and respect the rights of the ruled.\r\nIt taught a wife to efface herself for her husband's sake, but it did\r\nnot teach a husband any corresponding obligation towards a wife. In a\r\nword, it expounded the relation of the whole to its parts, but left\r\nunexpounded the relation of the parts to one another.\r\n\r\nA correlated fault was excessive reverence for rank and rigid\r\nexclusiveness of class. There was practically no ladder for the\r\ncommoner,--the farmer, the artisan, and the merchant--to ascend into\r\nthe circle of the samurai. It resulted that, in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries, gifted men of the despised grades sought in the\r\ncloister an arena for the exercise of their talents, and thus, while\r\nthe bushi received no recruits, the commoners lost their better\r\nelements, and Buddhism became a stage for secular ambition. It can\r\nnot be doubted that by closing the door of rank in the face of merit,\r\nbushido checked the development of the nation. Another defect in the\r\nbushido was indifference to intellectual investigation. The schoolmen\r\nof Kyoto, who alone received honour for their moral attainments, were\r\nnot investigators but imitators, not scientists but classicists. Had\r\nnot Chinese conservatism been imported into Japan and had it not\r\nreceived the homage of the bushi, independent development of original\r\nJapanese thought and of intellectual investigation might have\r\ndistinguished the Yamato race. By a learned Japanese philosopher (Dr.\r\nInouye Tetsujiro) the ethics of the bushi are charged with\r\ninculcating the principles of private morality only and ignoring\r\nthose of public morality.\r\n\r\nMILITARY FAMILES AND THEIR RETAINERS\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that the disposition of the Central Government\r\nwas to leave the provincial nobles severely alone, treating their\r\nfeuds and conflicts as wholly private affairs. Thus, these nobles\r\nbeing cast upon their own resources for the protection of their lives\r\nand properties, retained the services of bushi, arming them well and\r\ndrilling them assiduously, to serve as guards in time of peace and as\r\nsoldiers in war. One result of this demand for military material was\r\nthat the helots of former days were relieved from the badge of\r\nslavery and became hereditary retainers of provincial nobles, nothing\r\nof their old bondage remaining except that their lives were at the\r\nmercy of their masters.\r\n\r\nFIEFS AND TERRITORIAL NAMES\r\n\r\nAs the provincial families grew in numbers and influence they\r\nnaturally extended their estates, so that the landed property of a\r\ngreat sept sometimes stretched over parts, or even the whole, of\r\nseveral provinces. In these circumstances it became convenient to\r\ndistinguish branches of a sept by the names of their respective\r\nlocalities and thus, in addition to the sept name (uji or sei), there\r\ncame into existence a territorial name (myoji or shi). For example,\r\nwhen the descendants of Minamoto no Yoshiiye acquired great\r\nproperties at Nitta and Ashikaga in the provinces of Kotsuke and\r\nShimotsuke, they took the territorial names of Nitta and Ashikaga,\r\nremaining always Minamoto; and when the descendants of Yoshimitsu,\r\nyounger brother of Yoshiiye, acquired estates in the province of Kai,\r\nthey began to call themselves Takeda.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to pursue the subject further than to note that,\r\nwhile the names of the great septs (uji) were few, the territorial\r\ncognomens were very numerous; and that while the use of myoji (or\r\nshi) was common in the case of the Fujiwara, the Taira, and the\r\nMinamoto septs, the uji alone was employed by the Abe, the Ono, the\r\nTakahashi, the Kusakabe, the Ban, the Hata, and certain others. It\r\nwill readily be conceived that although the territorial sections of\r\nthe same sept sometimes quarrelled among themselves, the general\r\npractice was that all claiming common descent supported each other in\r\nwar. The Minamoto (Gen) bushi recognized as the principal family line\r\nthat of Tsunemoto from whom were descended the following illustrious\r\nchiefs:\r\n\r\n   Minamoto (Gen) no Tsunemoto, commander-in-chief of local Governments\r\n                             |\r\n                         Mitsunaka\r\n                             |\r\n                   +---------+--------+\r\n                   |                  |\r\n               Yorimitsu          Yorinobu\r\n                                      |\r\n                                  Yoriyoshi\r\n                                      |\r\n                                  Yoshiiye\r\n                                      |\r\n        +----------+------------+-----+-----+-----------+-----------+\r\n        |          |            |           |           |           |\r\n   Yoshimune   Yoshichika   Yoshikuni   Yoshitada   Yoshitoki   Yoshitaka\r\n                   |\r\n               Tameyoshi\r\n                   |\r\n        +----------+------------+-----------+\r\n        |          |            |           |\r\n   Yoshitomo   Yoshikata    Tametomo    Twenty others\r\n        |          |\r\n        |      Yoshinaka\r\n        |      (of Kiso)\r\n        |\r\n        +----------+---------+-----------+------------+\r\n                   |         |           |            |\r\n               Yoritomo   Noriyori   Yoshitsune   Six others\r\n\r\nA similar table for the Taira (Hei) runs thus:\r\n\r\n   Taira (Hei) no Sadamori (quelled the Masakado revolt).\r\n                     |\r\n                  Korehira (of Ise province)\r\n                     |\r\n                  -------\r\n                     |\r\n                  -------\r\n                     |\r\n                  Masamori (governed Ise, Inaba, Sanuki, etc.;\r\n                     |     quelled the rebellion of Minamoto\r\n          +----------+     Yoshichika).\r\n          |          |\r\n      Tadamasa    Tadamori (served the Emperors Shirakawa,\r\n                     |     Horikawa, and Toba;* subdued the\r\n                     |     pirates of Sanyo-do and Nankai-do)\r\n                     |\r\n                  Kiyomori (crushed the Minamoto and temporarily\r\n                     |     established the supremacy of the Taira).\r\n                     |\r\n                  Shigemori\r\n\r\nIn its attitude towards these two families the Court showed\r\nshort-sighted shrewdness. It pitted one against the other; If the\r\nTaira showed turbulence, the aid of the Minamoto was enlisted; and\r\nwhen a Minamoto rebelled, a Taira received a commission to deal with\r\nhim. Thus, the Throne purchased peace for a time at the cost of\r\nsowing, between the two great military clans, seeds of discord\r\ndestined to shake even the Crown. In the capital the bushi served as\r\npalace guards; in the provinces they were practically independent.\r\nSuch was the state of affairs on the eve of a fierce struggle known\r\nin history as the tumult of the Hogen and Heiji eras (1150-1160).\r\n\r\n*It is of this noble that history records an incident illustrative of\r\nthe superstitions of the eleventh century. The cloistered Emperor\r\nShirakawa kept Tadamori constantly by his side. One night, Shirakawa,\r\naccompanied by Tadamori, went to visit a lady favourite in a detached\r\npalace near the shrine of Gion. Suddenly the two men saw an\r\napparition of a demon covered with wirelike hair and having a\r\nluminous body. The Emperor ordered Tadamori to use his bow. But\r\nTadamori advanced boldly and, seizing the demon, found that it was an\r\nold man wearing straw headgear as a protection against the rain, and\r\ncarrying a lamp to kindle the light at the shrine. This valiant deed\r\non Tadamori's part elicited universal applause, as indeed it might in\r\nan era of such faith in the supernatural.\r\n\r\nTHE HOGEN INSURRECTION\r\n\r\nIt has been related in Chapter XXII that Taiken-mon-in, consort of\r\nthe Emperor Toba, was chosen for the latter by his grandfather, the\r\ncloistered Emperor Shirakawa, and that she bore to Toba a son who\r\nultimately ascended the throne as Sutoku. But, rightly or wrongly,\r\nToba learned to suspect that before she became his wife, the lady's\r\nrelations with Shirakawa had been over-intimate and that Sutoku was\r\nillegitimate. Therefore, immediately after Shirakawa's demise, Toba\r\ntook to himself an Empress, Kaya-no-in, daughter of Fujiwara\r\nTadazane; and failing offspring by her, chose another Fujiwara lady,\r\nBifuku-mon-in, daughter of Nagazane. For this, his third consort, he\r\nconceived a strong affection, and when she bore to him a prince, Toba\r\nplaced the latter on the throne at the age of three, compelling\r\nSutoku to resign. This happened in the year 1141, and there were\r\nthenceforth two cloistered Emperors, Toba and Sutoku, standing to\r\neach other in the relation of grandfather and grandson. The baby\r\nsovereign was called Konoe, and Fujiwara Tadamichi, brother of\r\nBifu-ku-mon-in, became kwampaku.\r\n\r\nBetween this Tadamichi and his younger brother, Yorinaga, who held\r\nthe post of sa-daijin, there existed acute rivalry. The kwampaku had\r\nthe knack of composing a deft couplet and tracing a graceful\r\nideograph. The sa-daijin, a profound scholar and an able economist,\r\nridiculed penmanship and poetry as mere ornament. Their father's\r\nsympathies were wholly with Yorinaga, and he ultimately went so far\r\nas to depose Tadamichi from his hereditary position as o-uji of the\r\nFujiwara. Thus, the enmity between Tadamichi and Yorinaga needed only\r\nan opportunity to burst into flame, and that opportunity was soon\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Konoe died (1155) at the early age of seventeen, and the\r\ncloistered sovereign, Sutoku, sought to secure the throne for his son\r\nShigehito, whom Toba's suspicions had disqualified. But\r\nBifuku-mon-in, believing, or pretending to believe, that the\r\npremature death of her son had been caused by Sutoku's incantations,\r\npersuaded the cloistered Emperor, Toba, in that sense, and having\r\nsecured the co-operation of the kwampaku, Tadamichi, she set upon the\r\nthrone Toba's fourth son, under the name of Go-Shirakawa (1156-1158),\r\nthe latter's son, Morihito, being nominated Crown Prince, to the\r\ncomplete exclusion of Sutoku's offspring. So long as Toba lived the\r\narrangement remained undisturbed, but on his death in the following\r\nyear (1156), Sutoku, supported by the sa-daijin, Yorinaga, planned to\r\nascend the throne again, and there ensued a desperate struggle.\r\nStated thus briefly, the complication suggests merely a quarrel for\r\nthe succession, but, regarded more closely, it is seen to derive\r\nrancour chiefly from the jealousies of the Fujiwara brothers,\r\nYorinaga and Tadamichi, and importance from the association of the\r\nMinamoto and the Taira families. For when Sutoku appealed to arms\r\nagainst the Go-Shirakawa faction, he was incited by Fujiwara Yorinaga\r\nand his father Tadazane, and supported by Taira Tadamasa as well as\r\nby jthe two Minamoto, Tameyoshi and Tametomo; while Go-Shirakawa's\r\ncause was espoused by Fujiwara Tadamichi, by Taira no Kiyomori, and\r\nby Minamoto Yoshitomo.\r\n\r\nAmong this group of notables the most memorable in a historical sense\r\nare Minamoto Tametomo and Taira Kiyomori. Of the latter there will\r\npresently be occasion to speak again. The former was one of those\r\nborn warriors illustrated by Yamato-dake, Saka-no-ye no Tamura-maro,\r\nand Minamoto no Yoshiiye. Eighth son of Minamoto Tameyoshi, he showed\r\nhimself so masterful, physically and morally, that his father deemed\r\nit wise to provide a distant field for the exercise of his energies\r\nand to that end sent him to Bungo in the island of Kyushu. Tametomo\r\nwas then only thirteen. In two years he had established his sway over\r\nnearly the whole island, and the ceaseless excursions and alarms\r\ncaused by his doings having attracted the attention of the Court,\r\norders for his chastisement were issued to the Dazai-fu, in\r\nChikuzen--futile orders illustrating only Kyoto's ignorance.\r\nTameyoshi, his father, was then removed from office as a punishment\r\nfor his son's contumacy, and thereupon Tametomo, esteeming filial\r\npiety as one of the bushi's first obligations, hastened to the\r\ncapital, taking with him only twenty-five of his principal retainers.\r\nHis age was then seventeen; his height seven feet; his muscular\r\ndevelopment enormous, and he could draw a bow eight feet nine inches\r\nin length. His intention was to purchase his father's pardon by his\r\nown surrender, but on reaching Kyoto he found the Hogen tumult just\r\nbreaking out, and, of course, he joined his father's party.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the opposing nobles deserves to be studied, as\r\nthis was probably one of the most unnatural struggles on record.\r\n\r\n   CLOISTERED EMPEROR'S SIDE   REIGNING EMPEROR'S SIDE\r\n\r\n   Sutoku (the Jo-o)          Go-Shirakawa, younger brother of Sutoku.\r\n\r\n   Fujiwara Yorinaga          Fujiwara Tadamichi, son of Tadazane\r\n                               and brother of Yorinaga.\r\n\r\n   Fujiwara Tadazane\r\n\r\n   Minamoto Tameyoshi         Minamoto Yoshitomo, son of Tameyoshi\r\n                               and brother of Tametomo.\r\n\r\n   Minamoto Tametomo\r\n\r\n   Taira no Tadamasa          Taira no Kiyomori, nephew of Tadamasa\r\n\r\nSutoku's party occupied the Shirakawa palace. Unfortunately for the\r\nex-Emperor the conduct of the struggle was entrusted to Fujiwara\r\nYorinaga, and he, in defiance of Tametomo's advice, decided to remain\r\non the defensive; an evil choice, since it entailed the tenure of\r\nwooden buildings highly inflammable. Yoshitomo and Kiyomori took full\r\nadvantage of this strategical error. They forced the Shirakawa\r\npalace, and after a desperate struggle,* the defenders took to\r\nflight. Thus far, except for the important issues involved and the\r\nunnatural division of the forces engaged, this Hogen tumult would not\r\nhave differed materially from many previous conflicts. But its sequel\r\nacquired terrible notoriety from the cruel conduct of the victors.\r\nSutoku was exiled to Sanuki, and there, during three years, he\r\napplied himself continuously to copying a Buddhist Sutra, using his\r\nown blood for ink. The doctrine of the Zen sect had not yet prevailed\r\nin Japan, and to obtain compensation in future happiness for the\r\npains he had suffered in life, it was essential that the exile's\r\nlaboriously traced Sutra should be solemnly offered to the Buddha. He\r\nsent it to Kyoto, praying that the necessary step should be taken.\r\nBut by the orders of his own brother, the Emperor, the request was\r\nrefused, and the manuscript returned. Superstition ultimately\r\nsucceeded where natural affection had failed; for the ex-Emperor,\r\nhaving inscribed maledictions on each of the five volumes of the\r\nSutra with blood obtained by biting his tongue, and having hastened\r\nhis demise by self-inflicted privations,--he died (1164) eight years\r\nafter being sent into exile--the evils of the time were attributed to\r\nhis unquiet spirit and a shrine was built to his memory.\r\n\r\n*One incident of the fight has been admiringly handed down to\r\nposterity. The duty of holding the west gate of the Shirakawa palace\r\nfell to Tametomo and his handful of followers. The duty of attacking\r\nit happened to devolve on his brother, Yoshitomo. To avert such an\r\nunnatural conflict, Tametomo, having proclaimed his identity, as was\r\nusual among bushi, drew his bow with such unerring aim that the arrow\r\nshore off an ornament from Yoshitomo's helmet without injuring him in\r\nany way. Yoshitomo withdrew, and the Taira took up the attack.\r\n\r\nNot less heartless was the treatment of the vanquished nobles. The\r\nFujiwara alone escaped. Yorinaga had the good fortune to fall on the\r\nfield of battle, and his father, Tadazane, was saved by the\r\nintercession of his elder son, Tadamichi, of whose dislike he had\r\nlong been a victim. But this was the sole spot of light on the sombre\r\npage. By the Emperor's orders, the Taira chief, Kiyomori, executed\r\nhis uncle, Tadamasa; by the Emperor's orders, though not without\r\nprotest, the Minamoto chief, Yoshitomo, put to death his father,\r\nTameyoshi; by the Emperor's orders all the relatives of Yorinaga were\r\nsent into exile; by the Emperor's orders his nephew, Prince\r\nShigehito, was compelled to take the tonsure, and by the Emperor's\r\norders the sinews of Tametomo's bow-arm were cut and he was banished\r\nto the Izu island.* In justice it has to be noted that Go-Shirakawa\r\ndid not himself conceive these merciless measures. He was prompted\r\nthereto by Fujiwara Michinori, commonly known as Shinzei, whose\r\ncounsels were all-powerful at the Court in those days.\r\n\r\n*The celebrated littérateur, Bakin, adduced many proofs that Tametomo\r\nultimately made his way to Ryukyu and that his descendants ruled the\r\nisland. The great soldier himself died ultimately by his own hand in\r\nthe sequel of an unsuccessful engagement with the forces of the\r\nvice-governor of Izu.\r\n\r\nGO-SHIRAKAWA\r\n\r\nGo-Shirakawa, the seventy-seventh sovereign, occupied the throne\r\nduring two years only (1156-1158), but he made his influence felt\r\nfrom the cloister throughout the long period of thirty-four years\r\n(1158 to 1192), directing the administration from his \"camera palace\"\r\n(Inchu) during the reigns of five Emperors. Ambition impelled him to\r\ntread in the footsteps of Go-Sanjo. He re-opened the Office of\r\nRecords (Kiroku-jo), which that great sovereign had established for\r\nthe purpose of centralizing the powers of the State, and he sought to\r\nrecover for the Throne its administrative functions. But his\r\nindependence was purely nominal, for in everything he took counsel of\r\nFujiwara Michinori (Shinzei) and obeyed that statesman's guidance.\r\nMichinori's character is not to be implicitly inferred from the cruel\r\ncourses suggested by him after the Hogen tumult. He was a man of keen\r\nintelligence and profound learning, as learning went in those days:\r\nthat is to say, he knew the classics by heart, had an intimate\r\nacquaintance with Buddhism and astrology, and was able to act as\r\ninterpreter of the Chinese language. With his name is associated the\r\norigin of the shirabyoshi, or \"white measure-markers\"--girls clad in\r\nwhite, who, by posture and gesture, beat time to music, and, in after\r\nages, became the celebrated geisha of Japan. To the practice of such\r\narts and accomplishments Michinori devoted a great part of his life,\r\nand when, in 1140, that is to say, sixteen years before the Hogen\r\ndisturbance, he received the tonsure, all prospect of an official\r\ncareer seemed to be closed to him. But the accession of Go-Shirakawa\r\ngave him an opportunity. The Emperor trusted him, and he abused the\r\ntrust to the further unhappiness of the nation.\r\n\r\nTHE HEIJI TUMULT\r\n\r\nGo-Shirakawa's son, Morihito, ascended the throne in 1159 and is\r\nknown in history as Nijo, the seventy-eighth sovereign of Japan. From\r\nthe very outset he resented the ex-Emperor's attempt to interfere in\r\nthe administration of affairs, and the two Courts fell into a state\r\nof discord, Fujiwara Shinzei inciting the cloistered Emperor to\r\nassert himself, and two other Fujiwara nobles, Tsunemune and\r\nKorekata, prompting Nijo to resist. These two, observing that another\r\nnoble of their clan, Fujiwara Nobuyori; was on bad terms with\r\nShinzei, approached Nobuyori and proposed a union against their\r\ncommon enemy. Shinzei had committed one great error; he had alienated\r\nthe Minamoto family. In the Hogen struggle, Yoshitomo, the Minamoto\r\nchief, an able captain and a brave soldier, had suggested the\r\nstrategy which secured victory for Go-Shirakawa's forces. But in the\r\nsubsequent distribution of rewards, Yoshitomo's claims received scant\r\nconsideration, his merits being underrated by Shinzei.\r\n\r\nThis had been followed by a still more painful slight. To Yoshitomo's\r\nformal proposal of a marriage between his daughter and Shinzei's son,\r\nnot only had a refusal been given, but also the nuptials of the youth\r\nwith the daughter of the Taira chief, Kiyomori, had been subsequently\r\ncelebrated with much eclat. In short, Shinzei chose between the two\r\ngreat military clans, and though such discrimination was neither\r\ninconsistent with the previous practice of the Fujiwara nor\r\nill-judged so far as the relative strength of the Minamoto and the\r\nTaira was concerned for the moment, it erred egregiously in failing\r\nto recognize that the day had passed when the military clans could be\r\nthus employed as Fujiwara tools. Approached by Nobuyori, Yoshitomo\r\njoined hands with the plotters, and the Minamoto troops, forcing\r\ntheir way into the Sanjo palace, set fire to the edifice and killed\r\nShinzei (1159). The Taira chief, Kiyomori, happened to be then absent\r\nin Kumano, and Yoshitomo's plan was to attack him on his way back to\r\nKyoto before the Taira forces had mustered. But just as Fujiwara\r\nYorinaga had wrecked his cause in the Hogen tumult by ignoring\r\nMinamoto Tametomo's advice, so in the Heiji disturbance, Fujiwara\r\nNobuyori courted defeat by rejecting Minamoto Yoshitomo's strategy.\r\nThe Taira, thus accorded leisure to assemble their troops, won such a\r\nsignal victory that during many years the Minamoto disappeared almost\r\ncompletely from the political stage, and the Taira held the empire in\r\nthe hollow of their hands.\r\n\r\nJapanese historians regard Fujiwara Shinzei as chiefly responsible\r\nfor these untoward events. Shinzei's record shows him to have been\r\ncruel, jealous, and self-seeking, but it has to be admitted that the\r\nconditions of the time were calculated to educate men of his type, as\r\nis shown by the story of the Hogen insurrection. For when Sutoku's\r\npartisans assembled at the palace of Shirakawa, Minamoto Tametomo\r\naddressed them thus: \"I fought twenty battles and two hundred minor\r\nengagements to win Kyushu, and I say that when an enemy is\r\noutnumbered, its best plan is a night attack. If we fire the\r\nTakamatsu palace on three sides to-night and assault it from the\r\nfourth, the foe will surely be broken. I see on the other side only\r\none man worthy to be called an enemy. It is my brother Yoshitomo, and\r\nwith a single arrow I can lay him low. As for Taira Kiyomori, he will\r\nfall if I do but shake the sleeve of my armour. Before dawn we shall\r\nbe victors.\"\r\n\r\nFujiwara Yorinaga's reply to this counsel was: \"Tametomo's method of\r\nfighting is rustic. There are here two Emperors competing for the\r\nthrone, and the combat must be conducted in a fair and dignified\r\nmanner.\" To such silliness the Minamoto hero made apt answer. \"War,\"\r\nhe said, \"is not an affair of official ceremony and decorum. Its\r\nmanagement were better left to the bushi whose business it is. My\r\nbrother Yoshitomo has eyes to see an opportunity. To-night, he will\r\nattack us.\". It is true that Tametomo afterwards refrained from\r\ntaking his brother's life, but the above proves that he would not\r\nhave exercised any such forbearance had victory been attainable by\r\nruthlessness. History does not often repeat itself so exactly as it\r\ndid in these Hogen and Heiji struggles. Fujiwara Yorinaga's refusal\r\nto follow Tametomo's advice and Fujiwara Nobuyori's rejection of\r\nYoshitomo's counsels were wholly responsible for the disasters that\r\nensued, and were also illustrative of the contempt in which the\r\nFujiwara held the military magnates, who, in turn, were well aware of\r\nthe impotence of the Court nobles on the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe manner of Yoshitomo's death, too, reveals something of the ethics\r\nof the bushi in the twelfth century. Accompanied by Kamada Masaie and\r\na few others, the Minamoto chief escaped from the fight and took\r\nrefuge in the house of his concubine, Enju, at Awobaka in Owari.\r\nThere they were surrounded and attacked by the Taira partisans. The\r\nend seemed inevitable. Respite was obtained, however, by one of those\r\nheroic acts of self-sacrifice that stand so numerously to the credit\r\nof the Japanese samurai. Minamoto Shigenari, proclaiming himself to\r\nbe Yoshitomo, fought with desperate valour, killing ten of the enemy.\r\nFinally, hacking his own face so that it became unrecognizable, he\r\ncommitted suicide. Meanwhile, Yoshitomo had ridden away to the house\r\nof Osada Tadamune, father of his comrade Masaie's wife. There he\r\nfound a hospitable reception. But when he would have pushed on at\r\nonce to the east, where the Minamoto had many partisans, Tadamune,\r\npointing out that it was New Year's eve, persuaded him to remain\r\nuntil the 3d of the first month.\r\n\r\nWhether this was done of fell purpose or out of hospitality is not on\r\nrecord, but it is certain that Tadamune and his son, Kagemune, soon\r\ndetermined to kill Yoshitomo, thus avoiding a charge of complicity\r\nand earning favour at Court. Their plan was to conceal three men in a\r\nbathroom, whither Yoshitomo should be led after he had been plied\r\nwith sake at a banquet. The scheme succeeded in part, but as\r\nYoshitomo's squire, Konno, a noted swordsman, accompanied his chief\r\nto the bath, the assassins dared not attack. Presently, however,\r\nKonno went to seek a bath-robe, and thereupon the three men leaped\r\nout. Yoshitomo hurled one assailant from the room, but was stabbed to\r\ndeath by the other two, who, in their turn, were slaughtered by the\r\nsquire. Meanwhile, Masaie was sitting, unsuspicious, at the\r\nwine-party in a distant chamber. Hearing the tumult he sprang to his\r\nfeet, but was immediately cut down by Tadamune and Kagemune. At this\r\njuncture Masaie's wife ran in, and crying, \"I am not faithless and\r\nevil like my father and my brother; my death shall show my\r\nsincerity,\" seized her husband's sword and committed suicide, at\r\nwhich sight the dying man smiled contentedly. As for Konno, after a\r\nfutile attempt to lay hands on Tadamune and Kagemune, he cut his way\r\nthrough their retainers and rode off safely. The heads of Yoshitomo\r\nand Masaie were carried to Kyoto by Tadamune and Kagemune, but they\r\nmade so much of their exploit and clamoured for such high reward that\r\nKiyomori threatened to punish them for the murder of a close\r\nconnexion--Kiyomori, be it observed, on whose hands the blood of his\r\nuncle was still wet.\r\n\r\nYoshitomo had many sons* but only four of them escaped from the Heiji\r\ntumult. The eldest of these was Yoritomo, then only fourteen. After\r\nkilling two men who attempted to intercept his flight, he fell into\r\nthe hands of Taira Munekiyo, who, pitying his youth, induced\r\nKiyomori's step-mother to intercede for his life, and he was finally\r\nbanished to Izu, whence, a few years later, he emerged to the\r\ndestruction of the Taira. A still younger son, Yoshitsune, was\r\ndestined to prove the most renowned warrior Japan ever produced. His\r\nmother, Tokiwa, one of Yoshitomo's mistresses, a woman of rare\r\nbeauty, fled from the Minamoto mansion during a snow-storm after the\r\nHeiji disaster, and, with her three children, succeeded in reaching a\r\nvillage in Yamato, where she might have lain concealed had not her\r\nmother fallen into the hands of Kiyomori's agents. Tokiwa was then\r\nrequired to choose between giving herself up and suffering her mother\r\nto be executed. Her beauty saved the situation. Kiyomori had no\r\nsooner seen her face than he offered to have mercy if she entered his\r\nhousehold and if she consented to have her three sons educated for\r\nthe priesthood. Thus, Yoshitsune survived, and in after ages people\r\nwere wont to say of Kiyomori's passion and its result that his\r\nblissful dream of one night had brought ruin on his house.\r\n\r\n*One of these sons, Tomonaga, fell by his father's hand. Accompanying\r\nYoshitomo's retreat, he had been severely wounded, and he asked his\r\nfather to kill him rather than leave him at Awobake to fall into the\r\nhands of the Taira. Yoshitomo consented, though the lad was only\r\nfifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nTHE TAIRA AND THE FUJIWARA\r\n\r\nIn human affairs many events ascribed by onlookers to design are\r\nreally the outcome of accident or unforseen opportunity. Historians,\r\ntracing the career of Taira no Kiyomori, ascribe to him singular\r\nastuteness in creating occasions and marked promptness in utilizing\r\nthem. But Kiyomori was not a man of original or brilliant\r\nconceptions. He had not even the imperturbability essential to\r\nmilitary leadership. The most prominent features of his character\r\nwere unbridled ambition, intolerance of opposition, and unscrupulous\r\npursuit of visible ends. He did not initiate anything but was content\r\nto follow in the footsteps of the Fujiwara. It has been recorded that\r\nin 1158--after the Hogen tumult, but before that of Heiji--he married\r\nhis daughter to a son of Fujiwara Shinzoi. In that transaction,\r\nhowever, Shinzei's will dominated. Two years later, the Minamoto's\r\npower having been shattered, Kiyomori gave another of his daughters\r\nto be the mistress of the kwampaku, Fujiwara Motozane. There was no\r\noffspring of this union, and when, in 1166, Motozane died, he left a\r\nfive-year-old son, Motomichi, born of his wife, a Fujiwara lady. This\r\nboy was too young to succeed to the office of regent, and therefore\r\nhad no title to any of the property accruing to the holder of that\r\npost, who had always been recognized as de jure head of the Fujiwara\r\nfamily. Nevertheless, Kiyomori, having contrived that the child\r\nshould be entrusted to his daughter's care, asserted its claims so\r\nstrenuously that many of the Fujiwara manors and all the heirlooms\r\nwere handed over to it, the result being a visible weakening of the\r\ngreat family's influence.*\r\n\r\n*See Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF THE HOGEN AND HEIJI INSURRECTIONS\r\n\r\nThe most signal result of the Hogen and Heiji insurrections was to\r\ntransfer the administrative power from the Court nobles to the\r\nmilitary chiefs. In no country were class distinctions more\r\nscrupulously observed than in Japan. All officials of the fifth rank\r\nand upwards must belong to the families of the Court nobility, and no\r\noffice carrying with it rank higher than the sixth might be occupied\r\nby a military man. In all the history of the empire down to the\r\ntwelfth century there had been only one departure from this rule, and\r\nthat was in the case of the illustrious General Saka-no-ye no\r\nTamura-maro, who had been raised to the third rank and made dainagon.\r\n\r\nThe social positions of the two groups were even more rigidly\r\ndifferentiated; those of the fifth rank and upwards being termed\r\ntenjo-bito, or men having the privilege of entree to the palace and\r\nto the Imperial presence; while the lower group (from the sixth\r\ndownwards) had no such privilege and were consequently termed\r\nchige-bito, or groundlings. The three highest offices (spoken of as\r\nsan-ko) could not be held by any save members of the Fujiwara or Kuga\r\nfamilies; and for offices carrying fifth rank upwards (designated\r\ntaifu) the range of eligible families extended to only four others,\r\nthe Ariwara, the Ki, the Oye, and the Kiyowara. All this was changed\r\nafter the Heiji commotion. The Fujiwara had used the military leaders\r\nfor their own ends; Kiyomori supplemented his military strength with\r\nFujiwara methods. He caused himself to be appointed sangi (councillor\r\nof State) and to be raised to the first grade of the third rank, and\r\nhe procured for his friends and relations posts as provincial\r\ngovernors, so that they were able to organize throughout the empire\r\nmilitary forces devoted to the Taira cause.\r\n\r\nThese steps were mere preludes to his ambitious programme. He married\r\nhis wife's elder sister to the ex-Emperor, Go-Shirakawa, and the\r\nfruit of this union was a prince who subsequently ascended the throne\r\nas Takakura. The Emperor Nijo had died in 1166, after five years of\r\neffort, only partially successful, to restrain his father,\r\nGo-Shirakawa's, interference in the administration. Nijo was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Rokujo, a baby of two years; and, a few months\r\nlater, Takakura, then in his seventh year, was proclaimed Prince\r\nImperial. Rokujo (the seventy-ninth sovereign) was not given time to\r\nlearn the meaning of the title \"Emperor.\" In three years he was\r\ndeposed by Go-Shirakawa with Kiyomori's co-operation, and Takakura\r\n(eightieth sovereign) ascended the throne in 1169, occupying it until\r\n1180. Thus, Kiyomori found himself uncle of an Emperor only ten years\r\nof age. Whatever may have been the Taira leader's defects, failure to\r\nmake the most of an opportunity was not among them. The influence he\r\nexercised in the palace through his sister-in-law was far more\r\nexacting and imperious than that exercised by Go-Shirakawa himself,\r\nand the latter, while bitterly resenting this state of affairs, found\r\nhimself powerless to correct it. Finally, to evince his discontent,\r\nhe entered the priesthood, a demonstration which afforded Kiyomori\r\nmore pleasure than pain. On the nomination of Takakura to be Crown\r\nPrince the Taira leader was appointed--appointed himself would be a\r\nmore accurate form of speech--to the office of nai-daijin, and within\r\na very brief period he ascended to the chancellorship, overleaping\r\nthe two intervening posts of u-daijin and sa-daijin. This was in the\r\nfiftieth year of his life. At fifty-one, he fell seriously ill and\r\ntook the tonsure by way of soliciting heaven's aid. People spoke of\r\nhim as Dajo Nyudo, or the \"lay-priest chancellor.\" Recovering, he\r\ndeveloped a mood of increased arrogance. His residence at Rokuhara\r\nwas a magnificent pile of building, as architecture then went,\r\nstanding in a park of great extent and beauty. There he administered\r\nState affairs with all the pomp and circumstance of an Imperial\r\ncourt. He introduced his daughter, Toku, into the Household and very\r\nsoon she was made Empress, under the name of Kenrei-mon-in.\r\n\r\nThus completely were the Fujiwara beaten at their own game and the\r\ntraditions of centuries set at naught. A majority of the highest\r\nposts were filled by Kiyomori's kinsmen. Fifteen of his family were\r\nof, or above, the third rank, and thirty were tenjo-bito.\r\n\"Akitsushima (Japan) was divided into sixty-six provinces. Of these\r\nthirty were governed by Taira partisans. Their manors were to be\r\nfound in five hundred places, and their fields were innumerable.\r\nTheir mansions were full of splendid garments and rich robes like\r\nflowers, and the spaces before their portals were so thronged with\r\nox-carriages and horses that markets were often held there. Not to be\r\na Taira was not to be a man.\"*\r\n\r\n*Gen-pei Seisuiki (Records of the Vicissitudes of the Minamoto and\r\nthe Taira).\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to note, too, with regard to these manors, that many\r\nof them were tax-free lands (koderi) granted in perpetuity. Such\r\ngrants, as has been already shown, were not infrequent. But they had\r\nbeen made, for the most part, to civilian officials, by whose serfs\r\nthey were farmed, the proceeds being forwarded to Kyoto for the\r\nsupport of their owners; whereas the koden bestowed on Taira officers\r\nwere, in effect, military fiefs. It is true that similar fiefs\r\nexisted in the north and in the south, but their number was so\r\ngreatly increased in the days of Taira ascendancy as almost to\r\nconstitute a new departure. Kiyomori was, in truth, one of the most\r\ndespotic rulers that ever held sway in Japan. He organized a band of\r\nthree hundred youths whose business was to go about Kyoto and listen\r\nto the citizens' talk. If anyone was reported by these spies as\r\nhaving spoken ill of the Taira, he was seized and punished. One day\r\nKiyomori's grandson, Sukemori, met the regent, Fujiwara Motofusa, and\r\nfailing to alight from his carriage, as etiquette required, was\r\ncompelled by the regent's retinue to do so. On learning of this\r\nincident, Kiyomori ordered three hundred men to lie in wait for the\r\nregent, drag him from his car and cut off his cue.\r\n\r\nPLOTS AGAINST THE TAIRA: KIYOMORI'S LAST YEARS\r\n\r\nAll these arbitrary acts provoked indignation among every class of\r\nthe people. A conspiracy known in history as the \"Shishi-ga-tani\r\nplot,\" from the name of the place where the conspirators met to\r\nconsult, was organized in 1177, having for object a general uprising\r\nagainst the Taira. At the Court of the cloistered Emperor the post of\r\ngon-dainagon was filled by Fujiwara Narichika, who harboured\r\nresentment against Kiyomori's two sons, Shigemori and Munemori,\r\ninasmuch as they held positions for which he had striven in vain,\r\nthe Left and Right generals of the guards. There was also a bonze,\r\nSaiko, who enjoyed the full confidence of Go-Shirakawa. In those days\r\nany cause was legitimized if its advocates could show an Imperial\r\nedict or point to the presence of the sovereign in their midst.\r\nThus, in the Heiji insurrection, the Minamoto received their severest\r\nblow when Fujiwara Korekata contrived that, under cover of darkness,\r\nthe Emperor, disguised as a maid-of-honour in the household\r\nof the Empress, should be transported in her Majesty's suite,\r\nfrom the Kurodo palace to the Taira mansion at Rokuhara. The\r\nMinamoto were thus transformed into rebels, and the Taira became\r\nthe representatives of Imperial authority. Therefore, in the\r\nShishi-ga-tani plot the part assigned to the priest Saiko was to\r\ninduce Go-Shirakawa to take active interest in the conspiracy and to\r\nissue a mandate to the Minamoto bushi throughout the country. No such\r\nmandate was issued, nor does it appear that the ex-Emperor attended\r\nany of the meetings in Shishi-ga-tani, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat he had full cognizance of, and sympathized with, what was in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy never matured. It was betrayed by Minamoto Yukitsuna.\r\nSaiko and his two sons were beheaded; Narichika was exiled and\r\nsubsequently put to death, and all the rest were banished. The great\r\nquestion was, how to deal with Go-Shirakawa. Kiyomori was for leading\r\ntroops to arrest his Majesty, and to escort him as a prisoner to the\r\nToba palace or the Taira mansion. None of the despot's kinsmen or\r\nadherents ventured to gainsay this purpose until Kiyomori's eldest\r\nson, Shigemori, appeared upon the scene. Shigemori had contributed\r\nmuch to the signal success of the Taira. Dowered with all the\r\nstrategical skill and political sagacity which his father lacked, he\r\nhad won victories for the family arms, and again and again had\r\nrestrained the rash exercise of Kiyomori's impetuous arrogance. The\r\nTaira chief had learned to stand in awe of his son's reproaches, and\r\nwhen Shigemori declared that he would not survive any violence done\r\nto Go-Shirakawa, Kiyomori left the council chamber, bidding Shigemori\r\nto manage the matter as he thought fit.* Thus, Go-Shirakawa escaped\r\nall the consequences of his association with the conspirators. But\r\nKiyomori took care that a copy of the bonze Saiko's confession,\r\nextracted under torture and fully incriminating his Majesty, should\r\ncome into the Imperial hands.\r\n\r\n*It is recorded that, on this occasion, Kiyomori, learning of his\r\nson's approach, attempted unsuccessfully to conceal under priestly\r\nrobes the armour he had donned to go to the arrest of Go-Shirakawa.\r\n\r\nA final rupture between the ex-Emperor and the Taira leader became\r\ndaily imminent. Two events contributed to precipitate it. One was\r\nthat in the year following the Shishi-ga-tani conspiracy, Kiyomori's\r\ndaughter, Toku, bore to Takakura a prince--the future Emperor Antoku\r\n(eighty-first sovereign). The Taira chief thus found himself\r\ngrandfather of an heir to the throne, a fact which did not tend to\r\nabate his arrogance. The second was the death of Shigemori, which\r\ntook place in 1179.\r\n\r\nShigemori's record shows him to have been at once a statesman and a\r\ngeneral. He never hesitated to check his father's extravagances, and\r\nit has to be recorded in Kiyomori's favour that, however, intolerant\r\nof advice or opposition he habitually showed himself, his eldest\r\nson's remonstrances were seldom ignored. Yet, though many untoward\r\nissues were thus averted, there was no sign that growing\r\nresponsibility brought to Kiyomori any access of circumspection. From\r\nfirst to last he remained the same short-sighted, passion-driven,\r\nimpetuous despot and finally the evil possibilities of the situation\r\nweighed so heavily on Shigemori's nerves that he publicly repaired to\r\na temple to pray for release from life. As though in answer to his\r\nprayer he was attacked by a disease which carried him off at the age\r\nof forty-two. There is a tradition that he installed forty-eight\r\nimages of Buddha in his mansion, and for their services employed many\r\nbeautiful women, so that sensual excesses contributed to the\r\nsemi-hysterical condition into which he eventually fell. That is not\r\nimpossible, but certainly a sense of impotence to save his father and\r\nhis family from the calamities he clearly saw approaching was the\r\nproximate cause of his breakdown.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KIYOMIZU-DEKA TEMPLE, AT KYOTO\r\n\r\nResults soon became apparent. The ex-Emperor, who had truly estimated\r\nShigemori's value as a pillar of Taira power, judged that an\r\nopportunity for revolt had now arrived, and the Taira chief, deprived\r\nof his son's restraining influence, became less competent than ever\r\nto manage the great machine which fortune had entrusted to his\r\ndirection. The first challenge came from the ex-Emperor's side. It\r\nhas been related above that one of Kiyomori's politic acts after the\r\nHeiji insurrection was to give his daughter to the regent; that, on\r\nthe latter's death, his child, Motomichi, by a Fujiwara, was\r\nentrusted to the care of the Taira lady; that a large part of the\r\nFujiwara estates were diverted from the regent and settled upon\r\nMotomichi, and that the latter was taken into a Taira mansion. The\r\nregent who suffered by this arbitrary procedure was Fujiwara\r\nMotofusa, the same noble whom, a few years later, Kiyomori caused to\r\nbe dragged from his car and docked of his queue because Motofusa had\r\ninsisted on due observance of etiquette by Kiyomori's grandson.\r\nNaturally, Motofusa was ready to join hands with Go-Shirakawa in any\r\nanti-Taira procedure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in 1179, on the death of Kiyomori's daughter, to whose\r\ncare Motomichi had been entrusted in his childhood, the ex-Emperor,\r\nat the instance of Motofusa, appropriated all her manors and those of\r\nMotomichi. Moreover, on the death of Shigemori shortly afterwards,\r\nthe same course was pursued with his landed property, and further,\r\nMotomichi, though lawful head of the Fujiwara family, son-in-law of\r\nKiyomori, and of full age, had been refused the post of chunagon, the\r\nclaim of a twelve year-old son of Motofusa being preferred.* The\r\nsignificance of these doings was unmistakable. Kiyomori saw that the\r\ngauntlet had been thrown in his face. Hastening from his villa of\r\nFukuhara, in Settsu, at the head of a large force of troops, he\r\nplaced the ex-Emperor in strict confinement in the Toba palace,\r\nsegregating him completely from the official world and depriving him\r\nof all administrative functions; he banished the kwampaku, Motofusa,\r\nand the chancellor, Fujiwara Moronaga; he degraded and deprived of\r\ntheir posts thirty-nine high officials who had formed the entourage\r\nof Go-Shirakawa; he raised Motomichi to the office of kwampaku, and\r\nhe conferred on his son, Munemori, the function of guarding Kyoto,\r\nstrong bodies of soldiers being posted in the two Taira mansions of\r\nRokuhara on the north and south of the capital.\r\n\r\n*See Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE YORIMASA CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\nIn 1180, at the instance of Kiyomori and partly, no doubt, because of\r\nthe difficult position in which he found himself placed with regard\r\nto his imprisoned father, the Emperor Takakura, then in his twentieth\r\nyear, resigned the throne in favour of Kiyomori's grandson, Antoku\r\n(eighty-first sovereign), a child of three. This was the culmination\r\nof the Taira's fortunes. There was at that time among the Kyoto\r\nofficials a Minamoto named Yorimasa, sixth in descent from Minamoto\r\nMitsunaka, who flourished in the tenth century and by whose order the\r\nheirloom swords, Hige-kiri and Hiza-kiri, were forged. This Yorimasa\r\nwas an expert bowman, a skilled soldier, and an adept versifier,\r\naccomplishments not infrequently combined in one person during the\r\nHeian epoch. Go-Shirakawa, appreciating Yorimasa's abilities,\r\nnominated him director of the Imperial Estates Bureau (Kurando) and\r\nafterwards made him governor of Hyogo.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until he had reached the age of seventy-five that, on\r\nKiyomori's recommendation, he received promotion, in 1178, to the\r\nsecond grade of the third rank (ju-sammi), thus for the first time\r\nobtaining the privilege of access to the Imperial presence. The\r\nexplanation of this tardy recognition is, perhaps, to be sought in\r\nYorimasa's preference of prudence to loyalty. In the year of Heiji,\r\nhe held his little band of bushi in the leash until the issue of the\r\nbattle could be clearly forseen, and then he threw in his lot with\r\nthe Taira. Such shallow fealty seldom wins its way to high place. Men\r\ndid not forget Yorimasa's record. His belated admission to the ranks\r\nof the tenjo-bito provoked some derision and he was commonly spoken\r\nof as Gen-sammi (the Minamoto third rank).\r\n\r\nBut even for one constitutionally so cautious, the pretensions of the\r\nTaira became intolerable. Yorimasa determined to strike a blow for\r\nthe Minamoto cause, and looking round for a figure-head, he fixed\r\nupon Prince Mochihito, elder brother of Takakura. This prince, being\r\nthe son of a concubine, had never reached Imperial rank, though he\r\nwas thirty years of age, but he possessed some capacity, and a noted\r\nphysiognomist had recognized in him a future Emperor. In 1170, at\r\nYorimasa's instance, Prince Mochihito secretly sent to all the\r\nMinamoto families throughout the empire, especially to Yoritomo at\r\nhis place of exile in Izu, a document impeaching the conduct of the\r\nTaira and exhorting the Minamoto to muster and attack them.\r\n\r\nYorimasa's story shows that he would not have embarked upon this\r\nenterprise had he not seen solid hope of success. But one of the aids\r\nhe counted on proved unsound. That aid was the Buddhist priesthood.\r\nKiyomori had offended the great monasteries by bestowing special\r\nfavour on the insignificant shrine of Itsukushima-Myojin. A\r\nrevelation received in a dream having persuaded him that his fortunes\r\nwere intimately connected with this shrine, he not only rebuilt it on\r\na scale of much magnificence, but also persuaded Go-Shirakawa to\r\nmake three solemn progresses thither. This partiality reached its\r\nacme at the time of Takakura's abdication (1180), for instead of\r\ncomplying with the custom hitherto observed on such occasions--the\r\ncustom of worshipping at one or more shrines of the three\r\ngreat monasteries--Enryaku (Hiei-zan), Kofuku (Nara), or Onjo\r\n(Miidera)--Takakura, prompted by Kiyomori, proceeded to Itsukushima.*\r\n\r\n*See Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nA monster demonstration on the part of the offended monasteries was\r\ntemporarily quieted, but deep umbrage rankled in the bosoms of the\r\npriests, and Yorimasa counted on their co-operation with his\r\ninsurrection. He forgot, however, that no bond could be trusted to\r\nhold them permanently together in the face of their habitual rivalry,\r\nand it was here that his scheme ultimately broke down. At an early\r\nstage, some vague news of the plot reached Kiyomori's ears and he\r\nhastened from his Fukuhara villa to Kyoto. But it soon became evident\r\nthat his information was incomplete. He knew, indeed, that Prince\r\nMochihito was involved, but he suspected Go-Shirakawa also, and he\r\nentertained no conception of Yorimasa's complicity. Thus, while\r\nremoving Go-Shirakawa to Rokuhara and despatching a force to seize\r\nMochihito, he entrusted the direction of the latter measure to\r\nYorimasa's son, Kanetsuna, who, it need scarcely be said, failed to\r\napprehend the prince or to elicit any information from his followers.\r\n\r\nPresently Kiyomori learned that the prince had escaped to Onjo-ji\r\n(Miidera). Thereupon secret negotiations were opened between Rokuhara\r\nand Enryaku-ji (Hiei-zan), not that the Taira chief suspected the\r\nlatter, but because he appreciated that if Hiei-zan joined Miidera,\r\nthe situation would become formidable. Meanwhile, his trust in\r\nYorimasa remaining still unshaken, he sent him to attack Onjo-ji,\r\nwhich mission the old Minamoto warrior fulfilled by entering the\r\nmonastery and joining forces with the prince. Yorimasa took this step\r\nin the belief that immediate aid would be furnished from Hiei-zan.\r\nBut before his appeal reached the latter, Kiyomori's overtures had\r\nbeen accepted. Nothing now remained for Yorimasa and Mochihito except\r\nto make a desperate rush on Kyoto or to ride away south to Nara,\r\nwhere temporary refuge offered. The latter course was chosen, in\r\nspite of Yorimasa's advice. On the banks of the Uji River in a dense\r\nfog they were overtaken by the Taira force, the latter numbering\r\ntwenty thousand, the fugitives three or four hundred. The Minamoto\r\nmade a gallant and skilful resistance, and finally Yorimasa rode off\r\nwith a handful of followers, hoping to carry Mochihito to a place of\r\nsafety. Before they passed out of range an arrow struck the old\r\nwarrior. Struggling back to Byodo-in, where the fight was still in\r\nprogress, he seated himself on his iron war-fan and, having calmly\r\ncomposed his death-song, committed suicide.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF CAPITAL AND DEATH OF KIYOMORI\r\n\r\nThese things happened in May, 1180, and in the following month\r\nKiyomori carried out a design entertained by him for some time. He\r\ntransferred the capital from Kyoto to Fukuhara, in Settsu, where the\r\nmodern town of Kobe stands. Originally the Taira mansions were at the\r\ntwo Fukuhara, one on the north of Kyoto, the other on the south, the\r\ncity being dominated from these positions. But Kiyomori seems to have\r\nthought that as the centres of Taira strength lay in the south and\r\nwest of the empire, the province of Settsu would be a more convenient\r\ncitadel than Kyoto. Hence he built at Fukuhara a spacious villa and\r\ntook various steps to improve the harbour--then called Muko--as well\r\nas to provide maritime facilities, among which may be mentioned the\r\nopening of the strait, Ondo no Seto. But Fukuhara is fifty miles from\r\nKyoto, and to reach the latter quickly from the former in an\r\nemergency was a serious task in the twelfth century. Moreover, Kyoto\r\nwas devastated in 1177 by a conflagration which reduced one-third of\r\nthe city to ashes, and in April of 1180 by a tornado of most\r\ndestructive force, so that superstitious folk, who abounded in that\r\nage, began to speak ominously of the city's doom.\r\n\r\nWhat weighed most with the Taira leader, however, was the propinquity\r\nof the three great monasteries; Hiei-zan on the north, Miidera on the\r\neast, and Nara on the south. In fact, the city lay at the mercy of\r\nthe soldier-priests. At any moment they might combine, descend upon\r\nthe capital, and burn it before adequate succour could be marshalled.\r\nThat such a peril should have been dreaded from such a source seems\r\nstrange; but the Buddhist priests had shown a very dangerous temper\r\nmore than once, and from Kiyomori's point of view the possibility of\r\ntheir rising to restore the fortunes of the Fujiwara was never\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nKiyomori carried with him to Fukuhara the boy-Emperor (Antoku), the\r\nex-Emperor (Takakura), the cloistered Emperor (Go-Shirakawa), the\r\nkwampaku (Motomichi), and all the high Court officials with rare\r\nexceptions. The work of construction at Fukuhara not being yet\r\ncomplete, Go-Shirakawa had to be lodged in a building thirty feet\r\nsquare, to which men gave the name of the \"jail palace.\" Kyoto, of\r\ncourse, was thrown into a state of consternation. Remonstrances,\r\npetitions, and complaints poured into the Fukuhara mansion. Meanwhile\r\nthe Minamoto rose. In August of 1180, their white flag was hoisted,\r\nand though it looked very insignificant on the wide horizon of Taira\r\npower, Kiyomori did not underrate its meaning. At the close of the\r\nyear, he decided to abandon the Fukuhara scheme and carry the Court\r\nback to Kyoto. On the eve of his return he found an opportunity of\r\ndealing a heavy blow to the monasteries of Miidera and Nara. For, it\r\nhaving been discovered that they were in collusion with the newly\r\nrisen Minamoto, Kiyomori sent his sons, Tomomori and Shigehira, at\r\nthe head of a force which sacked and burned Onjo-ji, Todai-ji, and\r\nKofuku-ji. Thereafter a terrible time ensued for Kyoto, for the home\r\nprovinces (Kinai), and for the west of the empire. During the greater\r\npart of three years, from 1180 to 1182 inclusive, the people\r\nsuffered, first from famine and afterwards from pestilence. Pitiful\r\naccounts are given by contemporary writers. Men were reduced to the\r\ndirest straits. Hundreds perished of starvation in the streets of\r\nKyoto, and as, in many cases, the corpses lay unburied, pestilence of\r\ncourse ensued. It is stated that in Kyoto alone during two months\r\nthere were forty-two thousand deaths. The eastern and western\r\nregions, however, enjoyed comparative immunity. By the priests and\r\nthe political enemies of the Taira these cruel calamities were\r\nattributed to the evil deeds of Kiyomori and his fellow clansmen, so\r\nthat the once omnipotent family gradually became an object of popular\r\nexecration. Kiyomori, however, did not live to witness the ruin of\r\nhis house. He expired at the age of sixty in March, 1181, just three\r\nmonths after the restoration of Kyoto to metropolitan rank. Since\r\nAugust of the preceding year, the Minamoto had shown signs of\r\ntroublesome activity, but as yet it seemed hardly possible that their\r\npuny onsets should shake, still less pull down, the imposing edifice\r\nof power raised by the Taira during twenty years of unprecedented\r\nsuccess. Nevertheless, Kiyomori, impatient of all reverses, bitterly\r\nupbraided his sons and his officers for incompetence, and when, after\r\nseven days' sickness, he saw the end approaching, his last commission\r\nwas that neither tomb nor temple should be raised to his memory until\r\nYoritomo's head had been placed on his grave.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ARTIST'S SEAL\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SWORD-GUARDS (Tsuba) HAND-CARVED IN BRONZE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE EPOCH OF THE GEN AND THE HEI (Continued)\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE CONFLICT\r\n\r\nWHEN, after the great struggle of 1160, Yoritomo, the eldest of\r\nYoshitomo's surviving sons, fell into the hands of Taira Munekiyo and\r\nwas carried by the latter to Kyoto, for execution, as all supposed,\r\nand as would have been in strict accord with the canons of the time,\r\nthe lad, then in his fourteenth year, won the sympathy of Munekiyo by\r\nhis nobly calm demeanour in the presence of death, and still more by\r\nanswering, when asked whether he did not wish to live, \"Yes, since I\r\nalone remain to pray for the memories of my father and my elder\r\nbrothers.\" Munekiyo then determined to save the boy if possible, and\r\nhe succeeded through the co-operation of Kiyomori's step-mother, whom\r\nhe persuaded that her own son, lost in his infancy, would have grown\r\nup to resemble closely Yoritomo.\r\n\r\nIt was much to the credit of Kiyomori's heart but little to that of\r\nhis head that he listened to such a plea, and historians have further\r\ncensured his want of sagacity in choosing Izu for Yoritomo's place of\r\nexile, seeing that the eastern regions were infested by Minamoto\r\nkinsmen and partisans. But Kiyomori did not act blindly. He placed\r\nYoritomo in the keeping of two trusted wardens whose manors were\r\npractically conterminous in the valley of the Kano stream on the\r\nimmediate west of Hakone Pass. These wardens were a Fujiwara, Ito\r\nSukechika, and a Taira, who, taking the name Hojo from the locality\r\nof his manor, called himself Hojo Tokimasa. The dispositions of these\r\ntwo men did not agree with the suggestions of their lineage.\r\nSukechika might have been expected to sympathize with his ward in\r\nconsideration of the sufferings of the Fujiwara at Kiyomori's hands.\r\nTokimasa, as a Taira, should have been wholly antipathetic. Yet had\r\nTokimasa shared Sukechika's mood, the Minamoto's sun would never have\r\nrisen over the Kwanto.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is that Tokimasa belonged to a large group of\r\nprovincial Taira who were at once discontented because their claims\r\nto promotion had been ignored, and deeply resentful of indignities\r\nand ridicule to which their rustic manners and customs had exposed\r\nthem at the hands of their upstart kinsmen in Kyoto. Moreover, it is\r\nnot extravagant to suppose, in view of the extraordinary abilities\r\nsubsequently shown by Tokimasa, that he presaged the instability of\r\nthe Taira edifice long before any ominous symptoms became outwardly\r\nvisible. At any rate, while remaining Yoritomo's ostensible warden,\r\nhe became his confidant and abettor.\r\n\r\nThis did not happen immediately, however. Yoritomo was placed\r\noriginally under Sukechika's care, and during the latter's absence in\r\nKyoto a liaison was established between his daughter and the Minamoto\r\ncaptive, with the result that a son was born. Sukechika, on his\r\nreturn, caused the child to be thrown into a cataract, married its\r\nmother to Ema Kotaro, and swore to have the life of his ward. But\r\nYoritomo, warned of what was pending, effected his escape to\r\nTokimasa's manor. It is recorded that on the way thither he prayed at\r\nthe shrine of Hachiman, the tutelary deity of his family: \"Grant me\r\nto become sei-i-shogun and to guard the Imperial Court. Or, if I may\r\nnot achieve so much, grant me to become governor of Izu, so that I\r\nmay be revenged on Sukechika. Or, if that may not be, grant me\r\ndeath.\" With Tokimasa he found security. But here again, though now a\r\nman over thirty, he established relations with Masa, his warden's\r\neldest daughter. In all Yoritomo's career there is not one instance\r\nof a sacrifice of expediency or ambition on the altar of sentiment or\r\naffection. He was a cold, calculating man. No cruelty shocked him nor\r\ndid he shrink from any severity dictated by policy. It is in the last\r\ndegree improbable that he risked his political hopes for the sake of\r\na trivial amour. At any rate the event suggests crafty deliberation\r\nrather than a passing passion. For though Tokimasa simulated\r\nignorance of the liaison and publicly proceeded with his previous\r\nengagement to wed Masa to Taira Kanetaka, lieutenant-governor of Izu,\r\nhe privately connived at her flight and subsequent concealment.\r\n\r\nThis incident is said to have determined Yoritomo. He disclosed all\r\nhis ambitions to Hojo Tokimasa, and found in him an able coadjutor.\r\nYoritomo now began to open secret communications with several of the\r\nmilitary families in Izu and the neighbouring provinces. In making\r\nthese selections and approaches, the Minamoto exile was guided and\r\nassisted by Tokimasa. Confidences were not by any means confined to\r\nmen of Minamoto lineage. The kith and kin of the Fujiwara, and even\r\nof the Taira themselves, were drawn into the conspiracy, and although\r\nthe struggle finally resolved itself into a duel à l'outrance between\r\nthe Taira and the Minamoto, it had no such exclusive character at the\r\noutset.\r\n\r\nIn May, or June, 1180, the mandate of Prince Mochihito reached\r\nYoritomo, carried by his uncle, Minamoto Yukiiye, whose figure\r\nthenceforth appears frequently upon the scene. Yoritomo showed the\r\nmandate to Tokimasa, and the two men were taking measures to obey\r\nwhen they received intelligence of the deaths of Mochihito and\r\nYorimasa and of the fatal battle on the banks of the Uji.\r\n\r\nYoritomo would probably have deferred conclusive action in such\r\ncircumstances had there not reached him from Miyoshi Yasunobu in\r\nKyoto a warning that the Taira were planning to exterminate the\r\nremnant of the Minamoto and that Yoritomo's name stood first on the\r\nblack-list. Moreover, the advisability of taking the field at once\r\nwas strongly and incessantly urged by a priest, Mongaku, who, after a\r\nbrief acquaintance, had impressed Yoritomo favourably. This bonze had\r\nbeen the leading figure in an extraordinary romance of real life.\r\nOriginally Endo Morito, an officer of the guards in Kyoto, he fell in\r\nlove with his cousin, Kesa,* the wife of a comrade called Minamoto\r\nWataru. His addresses being resolutely rejected, he swore that if\r\nKesa remained obdurate, he would kill her mother. From this dilemma\r\nthe brave woman determined that self-sacrifice offered the only\r\neffective exit. She promised to marry Morito after he had killed her\r\nhusband, Wataru; to which end she engaged to ply Wataru with wine\r\nuntil he fell asleep. She would then wet his head, so that Morito,\r\nentering by an unfastened door and feeling for the damp hair, might\r\nconsummate his purpose surely. Morito readily agreed, but Kesa,\r\nhaving dressed her own hair in male fashion and wet her head, lay\r\ndown in her husband's place.\r\n\r\n*Generally spoken of as \"Kesa Gozen,\" but the latter word signifies\r\n\"lady.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Morito found that he had killed the object of his passionate\r\naffection, he hastened to confess his crime and invited Wataru to\r\nslay him. But Wataru, sympathizing with his remorse, proposed that\r\nthey should both enter religion and pray for the rest of Kesa's\r\nspirit. It is related that one of the acts of penance performed by\r\nMongaku--the monastic name taken by Morito--was to stand for\r\ntwenty-one days under a waterfall in the depth of winter.\r\nSubsequently he devoted himself to collecting funds for\r\nreconstructing the temple of Takao, but his zeal having betrayed him\r\ninto a breach of etiquette at the palace of Go-Shirakawa, he was\r\nbanished to Izu, where he obtained access to Yoritomo and counselled\r\nhim to put his fortune to the test.*\r\n\r\n*Tradition says that among the means employed by Mongaku to move\r\nYoritomo was the exhibition of Yoshitomo's bones.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STAGE OF THE STRUGGLE\r\n\r\nThe campaign was opened by Hojo Tokimasa on the 8th of September,\r\n1180. He attacked the residence of the lieutenant-governor of Izu,\r\nTaira Kanetaka, burned the mansion, and killed Kanetaka, whose\r\nabortive nuptials with the lady Masa had been celebrated a few months\r\npreviously. Yoritomo himself at the head of a force of three hundred\r\nmen, crossed the Hakone Pass three days later en route for Sagami,\r\nand encamped at Ishibashi-yama. This first essay of the Minamoto\r\nshowed no military caution whatever. It was a march into space.\r\nYoritomo left in his rear Ito Sukechika, who had slain his infant son\r\nand sworn his own destruction, and he had in his front a Taira force\r\nof three thousand under Oba Kagechika. It is true that many Taira\r\nmagnates of the Kwanto were pledged to draw the sword in the Minamoto\r\ncause. They had found the selfish tyranny of Kiyomori not at all to\r\ntheir taste or their profit. It is also true that the Oba brothers\r\nhad fought staunchly on the side of Yoritomo's father, Yoshitomo, in\r\nthe Heiji war. Yoritomo may possibly have entertained some hope that\r\nthe Oba army would not prove a serious menace.\r\n\r\nWhatever the explanation may be, the little Minamoto band were\r\nattacked in front and rear simultaneously during a stormy night. They\r\nsuffered a crushing defeat. It seemed as though the white flag* was\r\nto be lowered permanently, ere it had been fully shaken out to the\r\nwind. The remnants of the Minamoto sought shelter in a cryptomeria\r\ngrove, where Yoritomo proved himself a powerful bowman. But when he\r\nhad tune to take stock of his followers, he found them reduced to six\r\nmen. These, at the suggestion of Doi Sanehira, he ordered to scatter\r\nand seek safety in flight, while he himself with Sanehira hid in a\r\nhollow tree. Their hiding-place was discovered by Kajiwara Kagetoki,\r\na member of the Oba family, whose sympathies were with the Minamoto.\r\nHe placed himself before the tree and signalled that the fugitives\r\nhad taken another direction. Presently, Oba Kagechika, riding up,\r\nthrust his bow into the hollow tree, and as two pigeons flew out, he\r\nconcluded that there was no human being within.\r\n\r\n*The Taira flew a red ensign; the Minamoto, a white.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MINAMOTO YORITOMO\r\n\r\nFrom the time of this hairbreadth escape, Yoritomo's fortunes rose\r\nrapidly. After some days of concealment among the Hakone mountains,\r\nhe reached the shore of Yedo Bay, and crossing from Izu to Awa, was\r\njoined by Tokimasa and others. Manifestoes were then despatched in\r\nall directions, and sympathizers began to flock in. Entering Kazusa,\r\nthe Minamoto leader secured the cooperation of Taira Hirotsune and\r\nChiba Tsunetane, while Tokimasa went to canvass in Kai. In short,\r\neight provinces of the Kwanto responded like an echo to Yoritomo's\r\ncall, and, by the time he had made his circuit of Yedo Bay, some\r\ntwenty-five thousand men were marshalled under his standard.\r\nKamakura, on the seacoast a few miles south of the present Yokohama,\r\nwas chosen for headquarters, and one of the first steps taken was to\r\nestablish there, on the hill of Tsurugaoka, a grand shrine to\r\nHachiman, the god of War and tutelary deity of the Minamoto.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tokimasa had secured the allegiance of the Takeda family\r\nof Kai, and was about to send a strong force to join Yoritomo's army.\r\nBut by this time the Taira were in motion. Kiyomori had despatched a\r\nbody of fifty thousand men under Koremori, and Yoritomo had decided\r\nto meet this army on the banks of the Fuji river. It became\r\nnecessary, therefore, to remove all potential foes from the Minamoto\r\nrear, and accordingly Hojo Tokimasa received orders to overrun Suruga\r\nand then to direct his movements with a view to concentration on the\r\nFuji. Thither Yoritomo marched from Kamakura, and by the beginning of\r\nNovember, 1180, fifty thousand Taira troops were encamped on the\r\nsouth bank of the river and twenty-seven thousand Minamoto on the\r\nnorth. A decisive battle must be fought in the space of a few days.\r\nIn fact, the 13th of November had been indicated as the probable\r\ndate. But the battle was never fought. The officer in command of the\r\nTaira van, Fujiwara no Tadakiyo, laboured under the disadvantage of\r\nbeing a coward, and the Taira generals, Koremori and Tadamori,\r\ngrandson and youngest brother, respectively, of Kiyomori, seem to\r\nhave been thrown into a state of nervous prostration by the\r\nunexpected magnitude of the Minamoto's uprising. They were debating,\r\nand had nearly recognized the propriety of falling back without\r\nchallenging a combat or venturing their heads further into the\r\ntiger's mouth, when something--a flight of water-birds, a\r\nreconnaissance in force, a rumour, or what not--produced a panic, and\r\nbefore a blow had been struck, the Taira army was in full retreat for\r\nKyoto.\r\n\r\nYOSHITSUNE\r\n\r\nIn the Minamoto camp there was some talk of pursuing the fugitive\r\nTaira, and possibly the most rapid results would thus have been\r\nattained. But it was ultimately decided that the allegiance of the\r\nwhole Kwanto must be definitely secured before denuding it of troops\r\nfor the purpose of a western campaign. This attitude of caution\r\npointed specially to the provinces of Hitachi and Shimotsuke, where\r\nthe powerful Minamoto families of Satake and Nitta, respectively,\r\nlooked coldly upon the cause of their kinsman, Yoritomo. Therefore\r\nthe army was withdrawn to a more convenient position on the Kiso\r\nRiver, and steps, ultimately successful, were taken to win over the\r\nNitta and the Satake.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that there arrived in Yoritomo's camp a youth of\r\ntwenty-one with about a score of followers. Of medium stature and of\r\nframe more remarkable for grace than for thews, he attracted\r\nattention chiefly by his piercing eyes and by the dignified\r\nintelligence of his countenance. This was Yoshitsune, the youngest\r\nson of Yoshitomo. His life, as already stated, had been saved in the\r\nHeiji disturbance, first, by the intrepidity of his mother, Tokiwa,\r\nand, afterwards, by the impression her dazzling beauty produced upon\r\nthe Taira leader. Placed in the monastery of Kurama, as stipulated by\r\nKiyomori, Yoshitsune had no sooner learned to think than he became\r\ninspired with an absorbing desire to restore the fortunes of his\r\nfamily. Tradition has surrounded the early days of this, the future\r\nBayard of Japan, with many romantic legends, among which it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish the true from the false. What is certain,\r\nhowever, is that at the age of fifteen he managed to effect his\r\nescape to the north of Japan. The agent of his flight was an\r\niron-merchant who habitually visited the monastery on matters of\r\nbusiness, and whose dealings took him occasionally to Mutsu.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Yoshitsune's novitiate in the Kurama temple, the\r\npolitical power in Japan may be said to have been divided between the\r\nTaira, the provincial Minamoto, the Buddhist priests, and the\r\nFujiwara, and of the last the only branch that had suffered no\r\neclipse during the storms of Hogen and Heiji had been the Fujiwara of\r\nMutsu. It has been shown in the story of the Three Years' War, and\r\nspecially in the paragraph entitled \"The Fujiwara of the North,\" that\r\nthe troops of Fujiwara Kiyohira and Minamoto Yoshiiye had fought side\r\nby side, and that, after the war, Kiyohira succeeded to the six\r\ndistricts of Mutsu, which constituted the largest estate in the hands\r\nof any one Japanese noble. That estate was in the possession of\r\nHidehira, grandson of Kiyohira, at the time when the Minamoto family\r\nsuffered its heavy reverses. Yoshitsune expected, therefore, that at\r\nleast an asylum would be assured, could he find his way to Mutsu. He\r\nwas not mistaken. Hidehira received him with all hospitality, and as\r\nMutsu was practically beyond the control of Kyoto, the Minamoto\r\nfugitive could lead there the life of a bushi, and openly study\r\neverything pertaining to military art. He made such excellent use of\r\nthese opportunities that, by the time the Minamoto standard was\r\nraised anew in Izu, Yoshitsune had earned the reputation of being the\r\nbest swordsman in the whole of northern Japan.\r\n\r\nThis was the stripling who rode into Yoritomo's camp on a November\r\nday in the year 1180. The brothers had never previously seen each\r\nother's faces, and their meeting in such circumstances was a dramatic\r\nevent. Among Yoshitsune's score of followers there were several who\r\nsubsequently earned undying fame, but one deserves special mention\r\nhere. Benkei, the giant halberdier, had turned his back upon the\r\npriesthood, and, becoming a free lance, conceived the ambition of\r\nforcibly collecting a thousand swords from their wearers. He wielded\r\nthe halberd with extraordinary skill, and such a huge weapon in the\r\nhand of a man with seven feet of stalwart stature constituted a\r\nmenace before which a solitary wayfarer did not hesitate to surrender\r\nhis sword. One evening, Benkei observed an armed acolyte approaching\r\nthe Gojo bridge in Kyoto. The acolyte was Yoshitsune, and the time,\r\nthe eve of his departure for Mutsu. Benkei made light of disarming a\r\nlad of tender years and seemingly slender strength. But already in\r\nhis acolyte days Yoshitsune had studied swordsmanship, and he\r\nsupplemented his knowledge by activity almost supernatural. The giant\r\nBenkei soon found himself praying for life and swearing allegiance to\r\nhis boy conqueror, an oath which he kept so faithfully as to become\r\nthe type of soldierly fidelity for all subsequent generations of his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nKISO YOSHINAKA\r\n\r\nLooking at the map of central Japan, it is seen that the seven\r\nprovinces of Suruga, Izu, Awa, Kai, Sagami, Musashi, and Kazusa are\r\ngrouped approximately in the shape of a Japanese fan (uchiwa), having\r\nIzu for the handle. Along the Pacific coast, eastward of this fan,\r\nlie the provinces of Shimosa and Hitachi, where the Nitta and the\r\nSatake, respectively, gave employment for some time to the diplomatic\r\nand military resources of the Minamoto. Running inland from the\r\ncircumference of the fan are Shinano and Kotsuke, in which two\r\nprovinces, also, a powerful Minamoto resurrection synchronized with,\r\nbut was independent of, the Yoritomo movement.\r\n\r\nThe hero of the Shinano-Kotsuke drama was Minamoto no Yoshinaka,\r\ncommonly called Kiso Yoshinaka, because his youth was passed among\r\nthe mountains where the Kiso River has its source. In the year 1155,\r\nYoshitomo's eldest son, Yoshihira,* was sent to Musashi to fight\r\nagainst his uncle, Yoshikata. The latter fell, and his son,\r\nYoshinaka, a baby of two, was handed to Saito Sanemori to be\r\nexecuted; but the latter sent the child to Shinano, where it was\r\nbrought up by Nakahara Kaneto, the husband of its nurse. Yoshinaka\r\nattained an immense stature as well as signal skill in archery and\r\nhorsemanship. Like Yoritomo and Yoshitsune, he brooded much on the\r\nevil fortunes of the Minamoto, and paid frequent visits to Kyoto to\r\nobserve the course of events. In the year 1180, the mandate of Prince\r\nMochihito reached him, and learning that Yoritomo had taken the\r\nfield, he gathered a force in Shinano. Between the two leaders there\r\ncould be no final forgetfulness of the fact that Yoritomo's brother\r\nhad killed Yoshinaka's father, and had ordered the slaying of\r\nYoshinaka himself. But this evil memory did not obtrude itself at the\r\noutset. They worked independently. Yoshinaka gained a signal victory\r\nover the Taira forces marshalled against him by the governor of\r\nShinano, and pushing thence eastward into Kotsuke, obtained the\r\nallegiance of the Ashikaga of Shimotsuke and of the Takeda of Kai.\r\nThus, the year 1180 closed upon a disastrous state of affairs for the\r\nTaira, no less than ten provinces in the east having fallen\r\npractically under Minamoto sway.\r\n\r\n*This Yoshihira was a giant in stature. He shares with Tametomo the\r\nfame of having exhibited the greatest prowess in the Hogen and Heiji\r\nstruggles. It was he who offered to attack Kyoto from Kumano a\r\nmeasure which, in all probability, would have reversed the result of\r\nthe Heiji war.\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nKiyomori expired in March, 1181, as already related. His last behest,\r\nthat the head of Yoritomo should be laid on his grave, nerved his\r\nsuccessors to fresh efforts. But the stars in their courses seemed to\r\nbe fighting against the Taira. Kiyomori's son, Munemori, upon whom\r\ndevolved the direction of the great clan's affairs, was wholly\r\nincompetent for such a trust. One gleam of sunshine, however,\r\nillumined the fortunes of the Heike. Two months after Kiyomori's\r\ndeath, a Taira army under Shigehira attacked Yukiiye, Yoritomo's\r\nuncle, who had pushed westward as far as Owari. This Yukiiye never\r\nshowed any qualities of generalship. He was repeatedly defeated, the\r\nonly redeeming feature of his campaigns being that he himself always\r\nescaped destruction. On this occasion he was driven out of Owari and\r\nforced to retire within the confines of the Kwanto.\r\n\r\nBut now the home provinces and the west fell into the horrors of\r\nfamine and pestilence, as described above; and in such circumstances\r\nto place armies in the field and to maintain them there became\r\nimpossible. The Taira had to desist from all warlike enterprises\r\nuntil the summer of 1182, when a great effort was made to crush the\r\nrapidly growing power of the Minamoto. Commissions of provincial\r\ngovernor were sent to Jo no Nagashige, a puissant Taira magnate of\r\nEchigo; to Taira no Chikafusa, of Etchu, and to Fujiwara Hidehira, of\r\nMutsu, who were all ordered to attack Yoritomo and Yoshinaka.\r\nHidehira made no response, but Nagashige set in motion against\r\nYoshinaka a strong force, swelled by a contingent from Kyoto under\r\nMichimori. The results were signal defeat for the Taira and the\r\ncarrying of the white flag by Yoshinaka into Echigo, Etchu, Noto, and\r\nKaga.\r\n\r\nDISSENSIONS AMONG THE MINAMOTO\r\n\r\nMeanwhile discord had declared itself between Yoritomo and Yoshinaka.\r\nIt has been shown that the records of the two families afforded no\r\nbasis of mutual confidence, and it has also been shown that the\r\nTakeda clan of Kai province were among the earliest adherents of the\r\nMinamoto cause. In view of Yoshinaka's brilliant successes, Takeda\r\nNobumitsu proposed a marriage between his daughter and Yoshinaka's\r\nson, Yoshitaka. This union was declined by Yoshinaka, whereupon\r\nNobumitsu suggested to Yoritomo that Yoshinaka's real purpose was to\r\nally his house with the Taira by marriage. Whether Nobumitsu believed\r\nthis, or whether his idea had its origin in pique, history does not\r\nindicate. But there can be no hesitation in concluding that a rupture\r\nbetween the two Minamoto chiefs was presaged by Yoritomo's entourage,\r\nwho judged that two Richmonds could not remain permanently in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThings gradually shaped themselves in accordance with that forecast.\r\nThe malcontents in Yoritomo's camp or his discomfited opponents began\r\nto transfer their allegiance to Yoshinaka; a tendency which\r\nculminated when Yoritomo's uncle, Yukiiye, taking umbrage because a\r\nprovincial governorship was not given to him, rode off at the head of\r\na thousand cavalry to join Yoshinaka. The reception given by\r\nYoshinaka to these deserters was in itself sufficient to suggest\r\ndoubts of his motives. Early in the year 1183, Yoritomo sent a force\r\ninto Shinano with orders to exterminate Yoshinaka. But the latter\r\ndeclined the combat. Quoting a popular saying that the worst enemies\r\nof the Minamoto were their own dissensions, he directed his troops to\r\nwithdraw into Echigo, leaving to Yoritomo a free hand in Shinano.\r\nWhen this was reported to Yoritomo, he recalled his troops from\r\nShinano, and asked Yoshinaka to send a hostage. Yoshinaka replied by\r\nsending his son Yoshitaka, the same youth to whom Takeda Nobumitsu\r\nhad proposed to marry his daughter. He was now wedded to Yoritomo's\r\ndaughter, and the two Minamoto chiefs seemed to have been effectually\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nADVANCE OF YOSHINAKA ON KYOTO\r\n\r\nYoshinaka's desire to avoid conflict with Yoritomo had been partly\r\ndue to the fact that the Taira leaders were known to be just then\r\nstraining every nerve to beat back the westward-rolling tide of\r\nMinamoto conquest. They had massed all their available forces in\r\nEchizen, and at that supreme moment Yoritomo's active hostility would\r\nhave completely marred Yoshinaka's great opportunity. In May, 1183,\r\nthis decisive phase of the contest was opened; Koremori, Tamemori,\r\nand Tomonori being in supreme command of the Taira troops, which are\r\nsaid to have mustered one hundred thousand strong. At first, things\r\nfared badly with the Minamoto. They lost an important fortress at\r\nHiuchi-yama, and Yukiiye was driven from Kaga into Noto. But when the\r\nmain army of the Minamoto came into action, the complexion of affairs\r\nchanged at once. In a great battle fought at Tonami-yama in Echizen,\r\nYoshinaka won a signal victory by the manoeuvre of launching at the\r\nTaira a herd of oxen having torches fastened to their horns.\r\nThousands of the Taira perished, including many leaders.\r\n\r\nOther victories at Kurikara and Shinowara opened the road to Kyoto.\r\nYoshinaka pushed on and, in August, reached Hiei-zan; while Yukiiye,\r\nthe pressure on whose front in Noto had been relieved, moved towards\r\nYamato; Minamoto no Yukitsuna occupied Settsu and Kawachi, and\r\nAshikaga Yoshikiyo advanced to Tamba. Thus, the capital lay at the\r\nmercy of Yoshinaka's armies. The latter stages of the Minamoto march\r\nhad been unopposed. Munemori, after a vain attempt to secure the\r\nalliance of the Hiei-zan monks, had recalled his generals and decided\r\nto retire westward, abandoning Kyoto. He would have taken with him\r\nthe cloistered Emperor, but Go-Shirakawa secretly made his way to\r\nHiei-zan and placed himself under the protection of Yoshinaka,\r\nrejoicing at the opportunity to shake off the Taira yoke.\r\n\r\nRETREAT OF THE TAIRA\r\n\r\nOn August 14, 1183, the evacuation of Kyoto took place. Munemori,\r\nrefusing to listen to the counsels of the more resolute among his\r\nofficers, applied the torch to the Taira mansions at northern and\r\nsouthern Rokuhara, and, taking with him the Emperor Antoku, then in\r\nhis sixth year, his Majesty's younger brother, and their mother,\r\ntogether with the regalia--the mirror, the sword, and the\r\ngem--retired westward, followed by the whole remnant of his clan.\r\nArrived at Fukuhara, they devoted a night to praying, making sacred\r\nmusic, and reading Sutras at Kiyomori's tomb, whereafter they set\r\nfire to all the Taira palaces, mansions, and official buildings, and\r\nembarked for the Dazai-fu in Chikuzen. They reckoned on the\r\nallegiance of the whole of Kyushu and of at least one-half of\r\nShikoku.\r\n\r\nEIGHTY-SECOND SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-TOBA (A.D. 1184-1198)\r\n\r\nThe Taira leaders having carried off the Emperor Antoku, there was no\r\nactually reigning sovereign in Kyoto, whither the cloistered Emperor\r\nnow returned, an imposing guard of honour being furnished by\r\nYoshinaka. Go-Shirakawa therefore resumed the administration of State\r\naffairs, Yoshinaka being given the privilege of access to the\r\nPresence and entrusted with the duty of guarding the capital. The\r\ndistribution of rewards occupied attention in the first place. Out of\r\nthe five hundred manors of the Taira, one hundred and fifty were\r\ngiven to Yoshinaka and Yukiiye, and over two hundred prominent Taira\r\nofficials were stripped of their posts and their Court ranks.\r\nYoritomo received more gracious treatment than Yoshinaka, although\r\nthe Kamakura chief could not yet venture to absent himself from the\r\nKwanto for the purpose of paying his respects at Court. For the rest,\r\nin spite of Yoshinaka's brilliant success, he was granted only the\r\nfifth official rank and the governorship of the province of Iyo.\r\n\r\nThese things could not fail to engender some discontent, and\r\npresently a much graver cause for dissatisfaction presented itself.\r\nFujiwara Kanezane, minister of the Right, memorialized the Court in\r\nthe sense that, as Antoku had left the capital, another occupant to\r\nthe throne should be appointed, in spite of the absence of the\r\nregalia. He pointed out that a precedent for dispensing with these\r\ntokens of Imperialism had been furnished in the case of the Emperor\r\nKeitai (507-531). No valid reason existed for such a precipitate\r\nstep. Antoku had not abdicated. His will had not been consulted at\r\nall by the Taira when they carried him off; nor would the will of a\r\nchild of six have possessed any validity in such a matter. It is\r\nplain that the proposal made by the minister of the Right had for\r\nmotive the convenience of the Minamoto, whose cause lacked legitimacy\r\nso long as the sovereign and the regalia were in the camp of the\r\nTaira.\r\n\r\nBut the minister's advice had a disastrous sequel. Yoshinaka was\r\nresolutely bent on securing the succession for the son of Prince\r\nMochihito, who had been killed in the Yorimasa emeute. It was\r\npractically to Mochihito that the Court owed its rescue from the\r\nTaira tyranny, and his son--now a youth of seventeen, known as Prince\r\nHokuriku, because he had founded an asylum at a monastery in\r\nHokuriku-do after his father's death--had been conducted to Kyoto by\r\nYoshinaka, under a promise to secure the succession for him. But\r\nGo-Shirakawa would not pay any attention to these representations. He\r\nheld that Prince Hokuriku was ineligible, since his father had been\r\nborn out of wedlock, and since the prince himself had taken the\r\ntonsure; the truth being that the ex-Emperor had determined to obtain\r\nthe crown for one of his own grandsons, younger brothers of Antoku.\r\nIt is said that his Majesty's manner of choosing between the two lads\r\nwas most capricious. He had them brought into his presence, whereupon\r\nthe elder began to cry, the younger to laugh, and Go-Shirakawa at\r\nonce selected the latter, who thenceforth became the Emperor Go-Toba.\r\n\r\nFALL OF YOSHINAKA\r\n\r\nYoshinaka's fortunes began to ebb from the time of his failure to\r\nobtain the nomination of Prince Hokuriku. A force despatched to\r\nBitchu with the object of arresting the abduction of Antoku and\r\nrecovering possession of the regalia, had the misfortune to be\r\nconfronted by Taira no Noritsune, one of the stoutest warriors on the\r\nside of the Heike. Ashikaga Yoshikiyo, who commanded the pursuers,\r\nwas killed, and his men were driven back pele-mele. This event\r\nimpaired the prestige of Yoshinaka's troops, while he himself and his\r\nofficers found that their rustic ways and illiterate education\r\nexposed them constantly to the thinly veiled sneers of the dilettanti\r\nand pundits who gave the tone to metropolitan society. The soldiers\r\nresented these insults with increasing roughness and recourse to\r\nviolence, so that the coming of Yoritomo began to be much desired.\r\nGo-Shirakawa sent two messages at a brief interval to invite the\r\nKamakura chief's presence in the capital. Yoritomo replied with a\r\nmemorial which won for him golden opinions, but he showed no sign of\r\nvisiting Kyoto. His absorbing purpose was to consolidate his base in\r\nthe east, and he had already begun to appreciate that the military\r\nand the Imperial capitals should be distinct.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when the fact of these pressing invitations to Yoritomo\r\nreached Yoshinaka's ears, he felt some resentment, and this was\r\nreflected in the demeanour of his soldiers, outrages against the\r\nlives and properties of the citizens becoming more and more frequent.\r\nEven the private domains of the cloistered Emperor himself, to say\r\nnothing of the manors of the courtiers, were freely entered and\r\nplundered, so that public indignation reached a high pitch. The\r\numbrage thus engendered was accentuated by treachery. Driven from\r\nKyushu, the Taira chiefs had obtained a footing in Shikoku and had\r\nbuilt fortifications at Yashima in Sanuki, which became thenceforth\r\ntheir headquarters. They had also collected on the opposite coast of\r\nthe Inland Sea a following which seemed likely to grow in dimensions,\r\nand, with the idea of checking that result, it was proposed to send\r\ntroops to the Sanyo-do under Minamoto Yukiiye, who had been named\r\ngovernor of Bizen. Taught, however, by experience that disaster was\r\nlikely to be the outcome of Yukiiye's generalship, Yoshinaka\r\ninterfered to prevent his appointment, and Yukiiye, resenting this\r\nslight, became thenceforth a secret foe of Yoshinaka.\r\n\r\nIn analyzing the factors that go to the making of this complicated\r\nchapter of Japanese history, a place must be given to Yukiiye. He\r\nseems to have been an unscrupulous schemer. Serving originally under\r\nYoritomo, who quickly took his measure, he concluded that nothing\r\nsubstantial was to be gained in that quarter. Therefore, he passed\r\nover to Yoshinaka, who welcomed him, not as an enemy of Yoritomo, but\r\nas a Minamoto. Thenceforth Yukiiye's aim was to cause a collision\r\nbetween the two cousins and to raise his own house on the ruins of\r\nboth. He contributed materially to the former result, but as to the\r\nlatter, the sixth year of his appearance upon the stage as Prince\r\nMochihito's mandate-bearer saw his own head pilloried in Kyoto.\r\n\r\nYoshinaka, however, had too frank a disposition to be suspicious. He\r\nbelieved until the end that Yukiiye's heart was in the Minamoto\r\ncause. Then, when it became necessary to choose, between taking\r\nstupendous risks in the west or making a timely withdrawal to the\r\neast, he took Yukiiye into his confidence. That was the traitor's\r\nopportunity. He secretly informed the ex-Emperor that Yoshinaka had\r\nplanned a retreat to the east, carrying his Majesty with him, and\r\nthis information, at a time when the excesses committed by\r\nYoshinaka's troops had provoked much indignation, induced\r\nGo-Shirakawa to obtain from Hiei-zan and Miidera armed monks to form\r\na palace-guard under the command of the kebiishi, Taira Tomoyasu, a\r\ndeclared enemy of Yoshinaka. At once Yoshinaka took a decisive step.\r\nHe despatched a force to the palace; seized the persons of\r\nGo-Shirakawa and Go-Toba; removed Motomichi from the regency,\r\nappointing Moroie, a boy of twelve, in his place, and dismissed a\r\nnumber of Court officials.\r\n\r\nIn this strait, Go-Shirakawa, whose record is one long series of\r\nundignified manoeuvres to keep his own head above water, applied\r\nhimself to placate Yoshinaka while privately relying on Yoritomo. His\r\nMajesty granted to the former the control of all the domains\r\npreviously held by the Taira; appointed him to the high office of\r\nsei-i tai-shogun (barbarian-subduing generalissimo), and commissioned\r\nhim to attack Yoritomo while, at the same time, the latter was\r\nsecretly encouraged to destroy his cousin. At that moment (February,\r\n1184), Yoritomo's two younger brothers, Yoshitsune and Noriyori, were\r\nen route for Kyoto, where they had been ordered to convey the Kwanto\r\ntaxes. They had a force of five hundred men only, but these were\r\nquickly transformed into the van of an army of fifty or sixty\r\nthousand, which Yoritomo, with extraordinary expedition, sent from\r\nKamakura to attack Yoshinaka.\r\n\r\nThe \"Morning Sun shogun\" (Asahi-shogun), as Yoshinaka was commonly\r\ncalled with reference to his brilliant career, now at last saw\r\nhimself confronted by the peril which had long disturbed his\r\nthoughts. At a distance of three hundred miles from his own base,\r\nwith powerful foes on either flank and in a city whose population was\r\nhostile to him, his situation seemed almost desperate. He took a step\r\ndictated by dire necessity--made overtures to the Taira, asking that\r\na daughter of the house of Kiyomori be given him for wife. Munemori\r\nrefused. The fortunes of the Taira at that moment appeared to be\r\nagain in the ascendant. They were once more supreme in Kyushu; the\r\nwest of the main island from coast to coast was in their hands; they\r\nhad re-established themselves in Fukuhara, and at any moment they\r\nmight move against Kyoto. They could afford, therefore, to await the\r\nissue of the conflict pending between the Minamoto cousins, sure that\r\nit must end in disaster for one side and temporary weakness for the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the situation was almost hopeless for Yoshinaka. There had\r\nnot been time to recall the main body of his troops which were\r\nconfronting the Taira. All that he could do was to arrest momentarily\r\nthe tide of onset by planting handfuls of men to guard the chief\r\navenues at Uji and Seta where, four years previously, Yorimasa had\r\ndied for the Minamoto cause, and Seta, where a long bridge spans the\r\nwaters of Lake Biwa as they narrow to form the Setagawa. To the Uji\r\nbridge, Nenoi Yukichika was sent with three hundred men; to the Seta\r\nbridge, Imai Kanehira with five hundred. The names of these men and\r\nof their brothers, Higuchi Kanemitsu and Tate Chikatada, are immortal\r\nin Japanese history. They were the four sons of Nakahara Kaneto, by\r\nwhom Yoshinaka had been reared, and their constant attendance on his\r\nperson, their splendid devotion to him, and their military prowess\r\ncaused people to speak of them as Yoshinaka's Shi-tenno--the four\r\nguardian deities of Buddhist temples. Their sister, Tomoe, is even\r\nmore famous. Strong and brave as she was beautiful, she became the\r\nconsort of Yoshinaka, with whom she had been brought up, and she\r\naccompanied him in all his campaigns, fighting by his side and\r\nleading a body of troops in all his battles. She was with him when he\r\nmade his final retreat and she killed a gigantic warrior, Uchida\r\nIeyoshi, who attempted to seize her on that occasion. Yoshinaka\r\ncompelled her to leave him at the supreme moment, being unwilling\r\nthat she should fall into the enemy's hands; and after his death she\r\nbecame a nun, devoting the rest of her days to prayers for his\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nBut it is not to be supposed that Yoshinaka repaid this noble\r\ndevotion with equal sincerity. On the contrary, the closing scene of\r\nhis career was disfigured by passion for another woman, daughter of\r\nthe kwampaku, Fujiwara Motofusa. Attracted by rumours of her beauty\r\nafter his arrival in Kyoto, he compelled her to enter his household,\r\nand when news came that the armies of Yoshitsune and Noriyori were\r\napproaching the capital, this great captain, for such he certainly\r\nwas, instead of marshalling his forces and making dispositions for\r\ndefence, went to bid farewell to the beautiful girl who resided in\r\nhis Gojo mansion. Hours of invaluable time passed, and still Asahi\r\nshogun remained by the lady's side. Finally, two of his faithful\r\ncomrades, Echigo Chuta and Tsuwata Saburo, seated themselves in front\r\nof the mansion and committed suicide to recall their leader to his\r\nsenses. Yoshinaka emerged, but it was too late. He could not muster\r\nmore than three hundred men, and in a short time Yoshitsune rode into\r\nthe city at the head of a large body of cavalry.\r\n\r\nYoshitsune had approached by way of Uji. He was not at all deterred\r\nby the fact that the enemy had destroyed the bridge. His mounted\r\nbowmen dashed into the river* and crossed it with little loss. A few\r\nhours brought them to Kyoto, where they made small account of the\r\nfeeble resistance that Yoshinaka was able to offer. Wounded and with\r\nlittle more than half a score of followers, Yoshinaka rode off, and\r\nreaching the plain Of Awazu, met Imai Kanehira with the remnant of\r\nhis five hundred men who had gallantly resisted Noriyori's army of\r\nthirty thousand. Imai counselled instant flight eastward. In Shinano,\r\nYoshinaka would find safety and a dominion, while to cover his\r\nretreat, Imai would sacrifice his own life. Such noble deeds were the\r\nnormal duty of every true bushi. Yoshinaka galloped away, but, riding\r\ninto a marsh, disabled his horse and was shot down. Meanwhile Imai,\r\nin whose quiver there remained only eight arrows, had killed as many\r\nof the pursuing horsemen, and then placing the point of his sword in\r\nhis mouth, had thrown himself headlong from his horse. One incident,\r\nshocking but not inconsistent with the canons of the time, remains to\r\nbe included in this chapter of Japanese history. It has been related\r\nthat Yoshinaka's son, Yoshitaka, was sent by his father to Kamakura\r\nas a hostage, and was married to Yoritomo's daughter. After the\r\nevents above related Yoshitaka was put to death at Kamakura,\r\napparently without Yoritomo's orders, and his widow, when pressed by\r\nher brother to marry again, committed suicide.\r\n\r\n*Japanese tradition loves to tell of a contest between Sasaki\r\nTakatsuna and Kajiwara Kagesue as to which should cross the river\r\nfirst. Kagesue was the son of that Kajiwara who had saved. Yoritomo's\r\nlife in the episode of the hollow tree.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF ICHI-NO-TANI\r\n\r\nThe victory of the armies led by Noriyori and Yoshitsune brought\r\nKamakura and Fukuhara into direct conflict, and it was speedily\r\ndecided that these armies should at once move westward to attack the\r\nTaira. A notable feature of the military operations of that era was\r\ncelerity. Less than a month sufficed to mobilize an army of fifty\r\nthousand men and to march it from Kamakura to Kyoto, a distance of\r\nthree hundred miles, and within ten days of the death of Yoshinaka\r\nthis same army, augmented to seventy-six thousand, began to move\r\nwestward from Kyoto (March 19, 1184). The explanation of this\r\nrapidity is furnished, in part, by simplicity of commisariat, and by\r\nthe fact that neither artillery nor heavy munitions of war had to be\r\ntransported. Every man carried with him a supply of cooked rice,\r\nspecially prepared so as to occupy little space while sufficing for\r\nseveral days' food, and this supply was constantly replenished by\r\nrequisitions levied upon the districts traversed. Moreover, every man\r\ncarried his own implements of war--bow and arrows, sword, spear, or\r\nhalberd--and the footgear consisted of straw sandals which never hurt\r\nthe feet, and in which a man could easily march twenty miles a day\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply to all the fighting men of whatever part of\r\nJapan, but as to the Kwanto bushi, their special characteristics are\r\nthus described by a writer of the twelfth century: \"Their ponderous\r\nbows require three men or five to bend them. Their quivers, which\r\nmatch these bows, hold fourteen or fifteen bundles of arrows. They\r\nare very quick in releasing their shafts, and each arrow kills or\r\nwounds two or three foemen, the impact being powerful enough to\r\npierce two or three thicknesses of armour at a time, and they never\r\nfail to hit the mark. Every daimyo (owner of a great estate) has at\r\nleast twenty or thirty of such mounted archers, and even the owner of\r\na small barren estate has two or three. Their horses are very\r\nexcellent, for they are carefully selected, while as yet in pasture,\r\nand then trained after their own peculiar fashion. With five or ten\r\nsuch excellent mounts each, they go out hunting deer or foxes and\r\ngallop up and down mountains and forests. Trained in these wild\r\nmethods, they are all splendid horsemen who know how to ride but\r\nnever how to fall. It is the habit of the Kwanto bushi that if in the\r\nfield of battle a father be killed, the son will not retreat, or if a\r\nson be slain the father will not yield, but stepping over the dead,\r\nthey will fight to the death.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Taira, as noted above, had by this time largely recovered from\r\nthe disasters suffered in their first encounters with Yoshinaka's\r\nforces. In the western provinces of the main island, in Shikoku, and\r\nin Kyushu, scions of the clan had served as governors in former\r\ntimes, so that ties of close intimacy had been established with the\r\ninhabitants. Since the first flight to Kyushu in August, 1183, their\r\ngenerals, Shigehira, Michimori, Noritsune, and others had defeated\r\nthe forces of Yoshinaka at Mizushima and those of Yukiiye at\r\nMuroyama, so that no less than fourteen provinces of the Sanyo-do and\r\nthe Nankai-do owned Taira sway, and by the beginning of 1184 they had\r\nre-occupied the Fukuhara district, establishing themselves at a\r\nposition of great natural strength called Ichi-no-tani in the\r\nprovince of Harima. Their lines extended several miles, over which\r\nspace one hundred thousand men were distributed. They lay within a\r\nsemi-circle of mountains supposed to be inaccessible from the north;\r\ntheir camp was washed on the south by the sea where a thousand\r\nwar-vessels were assembled; the east flank rested on a forest, and\r\nthe west was strongly fortified.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 1184, the Kamakura armies delivered their assault on\r\nthis position; Noriyori with fifty-six thousand men against the east\r\nflank at Ikuta; Yoshitsune's lieutenants with twenty thousand men\r\nagainst the west at Suma. Little progress was made. Defence and\r\nattack were equally obstinate, and the advantage of position as well\r\nas of numbers was with the former. But Yoshitsune himself had\r\nforeseen this and had determined that the best, if not the only, hope\r\nof victory lay in delivering an assault by descending the northern\r\nrampart of mountains at Hiyodori Pass. Access from that side being\r\ncounted impracticable, no dispositions had been made by the Taira to\r\nguard the defile. Yoshitsune selected for the venture seventy-five\r\nmen, among them being Benkei, Hatakeyama Shigetada, and others of his\r\nmost trusted comrades. They succeeded in riding down the steep\r\ndeclivity, and they rushed at the Taira position, setting fire to\r\neverything inflammable.\r\n\r\nWhat ensued is soon told. Taken completely by surprise, the Taira\r\nweakened, and the Minamoto, pouring in at either flank, completed the\r\nrout which had already commenced. Munemori was among the first of the\r\nfugitives. He embarked with the Emperor Antoku and the regalia, and\r\nsteered for Yashima, whither he was quickly followed by the remnants\r\nof his force. Shigehira, Kiyomori's fifth son, was taken prisoner.\r\nMichimori, Tadanori, and Atsumori were killed. Several illustrative\r\nincidents marked this great fight. Michimori's wife threw herself\r\ninto the sea when she heard of her husband's death. Tomoakira, the\r\nseventeen-year-old son of Tomomori, deliberately sacrificed himself\r\nto save his father, and the latter, describing the incident\r\nsubsequently to his brother, Munemori, said with tears: \"A son died\r\nto save his father; a father fled, leaving his son to die. Were it\r\ndone by another man, I should spit in his face. But I have done it\r\nmyself. What will the world call me?\" This same Tomomori afterwards\r\nproved himself the greatest general on the Taira side. Okabe\r\nTadazumi, a Minamoto captain, took the head of Tadanori but could not\r\nidentify it. In the lining of the helmet, however, was found a roll\r\nof poems and among them one signed \"Tadanori:\"\r\n\r\n   Twilight upon my path,\r\n   And for mine inn to-night\r\n   The shadow of a tree,\r\n   And for mine host, a flower.\r\n\r\nThis little gem of thought has gleamed on Tadanori's memory through\r\nall the centuries and has brought vicarious fame even to his slayer,\r\nTadazumi. Still more profoundly is Japanese sympathy moved by the\r\nepisode of Taira no Atsumori and Kumagaye Naozane. Atsumori, a\r\nstripling of fifteen, was seized by Naozane, a stalwart warrior on\r\nthe Minamoto side. When Naozane tore off the boy's helmet,\r\npreparatory to beheading him, and saw a young face vividly recalling\r\nhis own son who had perished early in the fight, he was moved with\r\ncompassion and would fain have stayed his hand. To have done so,\r\nhowever, would merely have been to reserve Atsumori for a crueller\r\ndeath. He explained his scruples and his sorrows to the boy, who\r\nsubmitted to his fate with calm courage. But Naozane vowed never to\r\nwield weapon again. He sent Atsumori's head and a flute found on his\r\nperson to the youth's father, Tsunemori, and he himself entered the\r\npriesthood, devoting the remaining years of his life to prayers for\r\nthe soul of the ill-fated lad. Such incidents do not find a usual\r\nplace in the pages of history, but they contribute to the\r\ninterpretation of a nation's character.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF YASHIMA\r\n\r\nThe battle of Ichi-no-tani was not by any means conclusive. It drove\r\nthe Taira out of Harima and the four provinces on the immediate west\r\nof the latter, but it did not disturb them in Shikoku or Kyushu, nor\r\ndid it in any way cripple the great fleet which gave them a signal\r\nadvantage. In these newly won provinces Yoritomo placed military\r\ngovernors and nominated to these posts Doi Sanehira and Kajiwara\r\nKagetoki, heroes, respectively, of the cryptomeria forest and the\r\nhollow tree. But this contributed little to the solution of the vital\r\nproblem, how to get at the Taira in Shikoku and in Kyushu. Noriyori\r\nreturned to Kamakura to consult Yoritomo, but the latter and his\r\nmilitary advisers could not plan anything except the obvious course\r\nof marching an army from Harima westward to the Strait of\r\nShimonoseki, and thereafter collecting boats to carry it across to\r\nKyushu. That, however, was plainly defective strategy. It left the\r\nflank of the westward-marching troops constantly exposed to attack\r\nfrom the coast where the Taira fleet had full command of the sea; it\r\ninvited enterprises against the rear of the troops from the enemy's\r\nposition at Yashima in Shikoku, and it assumed the possibility of\r\ncrossing the Strait of Shimonoseki in the presence of a greatly\r\nsuperior naval force.\r\n\r\nYet no other plan of operations suggested itself to the Kamakura\r\nstrategists. Yoshitsune was not consulted. He remained in Kyoto\r\ninstead of repairing to Kamakura, and he thereby roused the suspicion\r\nof Yoritomo, who began to see in him a second Yoshinaka. Hence, in\r\npresenting a list of names for reward in connexion with the campaign\r\nagainst the \"Morning Sun shogun,\" Yoritomo made no mention of\r\nYoshitsune, and the brilliant soldier would have remained entirely\r\nwithout recognition had not the cloistered Emperor specially\r\nappointed him to the post of kebiishi. Thus, when the largely\r\naugmented Minamoto force began to move westward from Harima in\r\nOctober, 1184, under the command of Noriyori, no part was assigned to\r\nYoshitsune. He remained unemployed in Kyoto.\r\n\r\nNoriyori pushed westward steadily, but not without difficulty. He\r\nhalted for a time in the province of Suwo, and finally, in March,\r\n1185, five months after moving out of Harima, he contrived to\r\ntransfer the main part of his force across Shimonoseki Strait and to\r\nmarshall them in Bungo in the north of Kyushu. The position then was\r\nthis: first, a Taira army strongly posted at Yashima in Sanuki\r\n(Shikoku), due east of Noriyori's van in Bungo, and threatening his\r\nline of communications throughout its entire length from Harima to\r\nthe Strait of Shimonoseki; secondly, another Taira army strongly\r\nposted on Hikoshima, an island west of Shimonoseki Strait, which army\r\nmenaced the communications between Noriyori's van across the water in\r\nBungo and his advanced base in Suwo, and thirdly, the command of the\r\nwhole Inland Sea in the hands of the Taira.\r\n\r\nEvidently, in such conditions, no advance into Kyushu could be made\r\nby Noriyori without inviting capital risks. The key of the situation\r\nfor the Minamoto was to wrest the command of the sea from the Taira\r\nand to drive them from Shikoku preparatory to the final assault upon\r\nKyushu. This was recognized after a time, and Kajiwara Kagetoki\r\nreceived orders to collect or construct a fleet with all possible\r\nexpedition, which orders he applied himself to carry out at Watanabe,\r\nin Settsu, near the eastern entrance to the Inland Sea. In justice to\r\nYoritomo's strategy it must be noted that these orders were given\r\nalmost simultaneously with the departure of the Minamoto army\r\nwestward from Harima, so that by the time of Noriyori's arrival in\r\nBungo, the military governor, Kagetoki, had got together some four\r\nhundred vessels at Watanabe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Yoshitsune had been chafing in Kyoto. To a man of his\r\ntemperament enforced passivity on the eve of such epoch-making events\r\nmust have been intolerable. He saw plainly that to drive the Taira\r\nfrom Shikoku was an essential preliminary to their ultimate defeat,\r\nand he saw, too, that for such an enterprise a larger measure of\r\nresolution and daring was needed than Kajiwara Kagetoki seemed\r\ndisposed to employ. He therefore obtained from the cloistered Emperor\r\nthe commission of tai-shogun (great general) and hastened to Settsu\r\nto take command. Complications ensued at once. Kagetoki objected to\r\nbe relegated to a secondary place, and Go-Shirakawa was induced to\r\nrecall Yoshitsune. But the latter refused to return to Kyoto, and, of\r\ncourse, his relations with Kagetoki were not cordial. The situation\r\nwas complicated by an unpleasant incident. Kagetoki wished to equip\r\nthe war-junks with sakaro. Yoshitsune asked what that meant, and\r\nbeing informed that sakaro signified oars at the bow of a boat for\r\nuse in the event of going astern, he said that such a provision could\r\ntend only to suggest a movement fatal to success.\r\n\r\n\"Do you contemplate retiring?\" he asked Kagetoki. \"So far as I am\r\nconcerned, I desire only to be equipped for advancing.\" Kagetoki\r\nindignantly replied: \"A skilful general advances at the right moment\r\nand retires at the right moment. You know only the tactics of a wild\r\nboar.\" Yoshitsune angrily retorted, \"I know not whether I am a boar\r\nor whether I am a deer, but I do know that I take pleasure in\r\ncrushing a foe by attacking him.\" From that moment the relations\r\nbetween the two generals were distinctly strained, and it will\r\npresently be seen that the consequences of their estrangement became\r\nhistorical.\r\n\r\nThe 21st of March, 1185, was a day of tempest. Yoshitsune saw his\r\nopportunity. He proposed to run over to the opposite coast and attack\r\nYashima under cover of the storm. Kagetoki objected that no vessel\r\ncould live in such weather. Yoshitsune then called for volunteers.\r\nAbout one hundred and fifty daring spirits responded. They embarked\r\nin five war-junks, some of the sailors being ordered to choose\r\nbetween manning the vessels or dying by the sword. Sweeping over the\r\nHarima Nada with the storm astern, Yoshitsune and his little band of\r\nheroic men landed safely on the Awa coast, and dashed at once to the\r\nassault of the Taira, who were taken wholly by surprise, never\r\nimagining that any forces could have essayed such an enterprise in\r\nsuch a tempest. Some fought resolutely, but ultimately all that had\r\nnot perished under the swords of the Minamoto obeyed Munemori's\r\norders to embark, and the evening of the 23rd of March saw the Taira\r\nfleet congregated in Shido Bay and crowded with fugitives. There they\r\nwere attacked at dawn on the 24th by Yoshitsune, to whom there had\r\narrived on the previous evening a re-enforcement of thirty war-junks,\r\nsent, not by Kagetoki, but by a Minamoto supporter who had been\r\ndriven from the province of Iyo some time previously by the Taira.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the impetuosity of Yoshitsune's onset carried everything\r\nbefore it. Soon the Taira fleet was flying down the Inland Sea, and\r\nwhen Kajiwara Kagetoki, having at length completed his preparations,\r\narrived off Yashima on the 25th of March with some four hundred\r\nwar-vessels, he found only the ashes of the Taira palaces and\r\npalisades. Munemori, with the boy Emperor and all the survivors of\r\nthe Taira, had fled by sea to join Tomomori at Hikoshima. This\r\nenterprise was even more brilliant and much more conclusive than that\r\nof Ichi-no-tani. During three consecutive days, with a mere handful\r\nof one hundred and fifty followers, Yoshitsune had engaged a powerful\r\nTaira army on shore, and on the fourth day he had attacked and routed\r\nthem at sea, where the disparity of force must have been evident and\r\nwhere no adventitious natural aids were available.\r\n\r\nWhen every allowance is made for the incompetence of the Taira\r\ncommander, Munemori, and for the crippling necessity of securing the\r\nsafety of the child-sovereign, Antoku, the battle of Yashima still\r\nremains one of the most extraordinary military feats on record. Among\r\nthe incidents of the battle, it is recorded that Yoshitsune himself\r\nwas in imminent peril at one time, and the details illustrate the\r\nmanner of fighting in that era. He dropped his bow into the sea\r\nduring the naval engagement, and when he essayed to pick it up, some\r\nTaira soldiers hooked his armour with a grapnel. Yoshitsune severed\r\nthe haft of the grapnel with his sword and deliberately picked up the\r\nbow. Asked why he had imperilled his person for a mere bow, he\r\nreplied, \"Had it been a bow such as my uncle Tametomo bent, its\r\nfalling into the enemy's possession would not matter; but a weak bow\r\nlike mine would give them something to laugh at.\" Observing this\r\nincident, Noritsune, one of the best fighters and most skilled\r\narchers among the Taira, made Yoshitsune the target of his shafts.\r\nBut Sato Tsuginobu, member of the band of trusted comrades who had\r\naccompanied the Minamoto hero from Mutsu, interposed his body and\r\nreceived the arrow destined for Yoshitsune. Kikuo, Noritsune's\r\nsquire, leaped from his boat to decapitate the wounded Tsuginobu, but\r\nwas shot down by the latter's younger brother. Yoshitsune pillowed\r\nTsuginobu's head on his knees and asked the dying man whether he had\r\nany last message. The answer was: \"To die for my lord is not death. I\r\nhave longed for such an end ever since we took the field. My only\r\nregret is that I cannot live to see the annihilation of the Taira.\"\r\nYoshitsune, weeping, said, \"To annihilate the Taira is a mere matter\r\nof days, but all time would not suffice to repay your devotion.\"\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF DAN-NO-URA\r\n\r\nThe fight at Yashima was followed by a month's interval of\r\ncomparatively minor operations, undertaken for the purpose of\r\nbringing Shikoku completely under Minamoto sway. During that time the\r\ntwo clans prepared for final action. The Taira would have withdrawn\r\naltogether into Kyushu, but such a course must have been preceded by\r\nthe dislodging of Noriyori, with his army of thirty thousand men,\r\nfrom Bungo province, which they had occupied since the beginning of\r\nMarch. It is true that Noriyori himself was unable to make any\r\nfurther incursion into Kyushu so long as his maritime communications\r\nwith his advanced base in Suwo remained at the mercy of the Taira\r\nfleet. But it is equally true that the Taira generals dared not enter\r\nKyushu so long as a strong Minamoto force was planted on the left\r\nflank of their route.\r\n\r\nThus, a peculiar situation existed at the beginning of April, 1185.\r\nOf the two provinces at the extreme south of the main island, one,\r\nthe eastern (Suwo), was in Minamoto occupation; the other, the\r\nwestern (Nagato), was mainly held by the Taira; and of the three\r\nprovinces forming the northern littoral of Kyushu, two, the western\r\n(Chikuzen and Buzen), were in Taira hands, and the third, the eastern\r\n(Bungo), was the camp of Noriyori with his thirty thousand men.\r\nFinally, the Strait of Shimonoseki between Chikuzen and Buzen was in\r\nTaira possession. Evidently the aim of the Taira must be to eliminate\r\nNoriyori from the battle now pending, and to that end they selected\r\nfor arena Dan-no-ura, that is to say, the littoral of Nagato province\r\nimmediately east of the Shimonoseki Strait.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that ever since the Ichi-no-tani fight, the Minamoto\r\ngenerals, especially Kajiwara Kagetoki, had been actively engaged in\r\nbuilding, or otherwise acquiring, war-junks. By April, 1185, they had\r\nbrought together a squadron of seven to eight hundred; whereas, in\r\nthe sequel of Yashima and minor engagements, the Taira fleet had been\r\nreduced to some five hundred. The war-junk of those days was not a\r\ncomplicated machine. Propelled by oars, it had no fighting capacities\r\nof its own, its main purpose being to carry its occupants within\r\nbow-range or sword-reach of their adversaries. Naval tactics\r\nconsisted solely in getting the wind-gage for archery purposes.\r\n\r\nBy the 22nd of April, 1185, the whole of the Minamoto fleet had\r\nassembled at Oshima, an island lying off the southeast of Suwo, the\r\nTaira vessels, with the exception of the Hikoshima contingent, being\r\nanchored at Dan-no-ura. On that day, a strong squadron, sent out by\r\nYoshitsune for reconnoitring purposes, marshalled itself at a\r\ndistance of about two miles from the Taira array, and this fact\r\nhaving been signalled to the Taira general, Tomomori, at Hikoshima,\r\nhe at once passed the strait and joined forces with the main fleet at\r\nDan-no-ura. Yoshitsune's design had been to deliver a general attack\r\nimmediately after the despatch of the reconnoitring squadron, but\r\nthis was prevented by a deluge of blinding rain which lasted until\r\nthe night of the 24th.\r\n\r\nThus, it was not until the 25th that the battle took place. It\r\ncommenced with an inconclusive archery duel at long range, whereafter\r\nthe two fleets closed up and a desperate hand-to-hand struggle\r\nensued. Neither side could claim any decisive advantage until Taguchi\r\nShigeyoshi deserted from the Taira and passed over with all his ships\r\nto the Minamoto. This Taguchi had been originally an influential\r\nmagnate of Iyo in Shikoku, whence he had accompanied the Taira\r\nretreat to Nagato, leaving his son with three thousand men to defend\r\nthe family manors in Iyo. The son was so generously treated by the\r\nMinamoto that he threw in his lot with them and sent letters urging\r\nhis father to adopt the same cause. Taguchi not only followed his\r\nson's advice but also chose the moment most disastrous for the Taira.\r\n\r\nHis defection was followed quickly by the complete rout of the Heike.\r\nA resolute attempt was made to defend the ship containing the young\r\nEmperor, his mother, his grandmother, and several other Taira ladies;\r\nbut the vessel finally passed into Minamoto possession. Not before\r\nshe had been the scene of a terrible tragedy, however. Kiyomori's\r\nwidow, the Ni-i-no-ama, grandmother of Antoku, took the six-year old\r\nchild in her arms and jumped into the sea, followed by Antoku's\r\nmother, the Empress Dowager (Kenrei-mon-in), carrying the regalia,\r\nand by other court ladies. The Empress Dowager was rescued, as were\r\nalso the sacred mirror and the gem, but the sword was irrevocably\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe Taira leader, Munemori, and his son, Kiyomune, were taken\r\nprisoner, but Tomomori, Noritsune, and seven other Taira generals\r\nwere drowned. Noritsune distinguished himself conspicuously. He\r\nsingled out Yoshitsune for the object of his attack, but being unable\r\nto reach him, he seized two Minamoto bushi and sprang into the sea\r\nwith them. Tomomori, Munemori's brother, who had proved himself a\r\nmost able general, leaped overboard carrying an anchor. Yoshitsune\r\nspoke in strongly laudatory terms of Noritsune and ascribed to him\r\nmuch of the power hitherto wielded by the Taira. Munemori and his son\r\nwere executed finally at Omi. Shigehira, in response to a petition\r\nfrom the Nara priests whose fanes he had destroyed by Kiyomori's\r\norders, was handed over to the monks and put to death by them at\r\nNarasaka. But Kiyomori's brother, who had interceded for the life of\r\nYoritomo after the Heiji emeule, was pardoned, his rank and property\r\nbeing restored to him; and Taira no Munekiyo, who also had acted an\r\nimportant part in saving Yoritomo at that time, was invited to visit\r\nKamakura where he would have been received with honour; but he\r\ndeclined the invitation, declaring that a change of allegiance at\r\nsuch a moment would be unworthy of a bushi.\r\n\r\nIt may here be noted that, although several of the Taira leaders who\r\ntook the field against the Minamoto were killed in the campaign or\r\nexecuted or exiled after it, the punitory measures adopted by\r\nYoritomo were not by any means wholesale. To be a Taira did not\r\nnecessarily involve Kamakura's enmity. On the contrary, not only was\r\nclemency extended to several prominent members of Kiyomori's kith and\r\nkin, but also many local magnates of Taira origin whose estates lay\r\nin the Kwanto were from first to last staunch supporters and friends\r\nof the Minamoto. After Dan-no-ura, the Heike's sun permanently ceased\r\nto dominate the political firmament, but not a few Heike stars rose\r\nsubsequently from time to time above the horizon.\r\n\r\nMUNEMORI AND ANTOKU\r\n\r\nThe record of Munemori, whose leadership proved fatal to the Taira\r\ncause, stamps him as something very rare among Japanese bushi--a\r\ncoward. He was the first to fly from every battle-field, and at\r\nDan-no-ura he preferred surrender to death. Tradition alleges that in\r\nthis final fight Munemori's reputed mother, Ni-i-no-ama, before\r\nthrowing herself into the sea with the Emperor in her arms, confessed\r\nthat Munemori was not her son. After she had borne Shigemori she\r\nbecame enceinte and her husband, Kiyomori, looked eagerly for the\r\nbirth of another boy. But a girl was born. Just at that time the wife\r\nof a man who combined the occupations of bonze and umbrella-maker,\r\nbore a son, and the two children were surreptitiously exchanged. This\r\nstory does not rest upon infallible testimony. Nor does another\r\nnarrative, with regard to the motives which induced Kiyomori's widow\r\nto drown the young Emperor. Those motives are said to have been two.\r\nOne was to fix upon the Minamoto the heinous crime of having done a\r\nsovereign to death, so that some avenger might rise in future years;\r\nthe other was to hide the fact that Antoku was in reality a girl\r\nwhose sex had been concealed in the interest of the child's maternal\r\ngrandfather, Kiyomori.\r\n\r\nYOSHITSUNE'S FATE\r\n\r\nYoshitsune's signal victories were at Ichi-no-tani and at Yashima.\r\nThe fight at Dan-no-ura could not have made him famous, for its issue\r\nwas determined by defection in the enemy's ranks, not by any\r\nstrategical device or opportune coup on the side of the victors. Yet\r\nJapan accords to Yoshitsune the first place among her great captains.\r\nUndoubtedly this estimate is influenced by sympathy. Pursued by the\r\nrelentless anger of his own brother, whose cause he had so splendidly\r\nchampioned, he was forced to fly for refuge to the north, and was\r\nultimately done to death. This most cruel return for glorious deeds\r\nhas invested his memory with a mist of tears tending to obscure the\r\ntrue outlines of events, so that while Yoritomo is execrated as an\r\ninhuman, selfish tyrant, Yoshitsune is worshipped as a faultless\r\nhero. Yet, when examined closely, the situation undergoes some\r\nmodifications. Yoritomo's keen insight discerned in his\r\nhalf-brother's attitude something more than mere rivalry. He\r\ndiscovered the possible establishment of special relations between\r\nthe Imperial Court and a section of the Minamoto.\r\n\r\nYoshitsune's failure to repair to Kamakura after the battle of\r\nIchi-no-tani inspired Yoritomo's first doubts. Japanese annals offer\r\nno explanation of Yoshitsune's procedure on that occasion. It would\r\nhave been in the reasonable sequence of events that the military\r\ngenius which planned and carried out the great coup at Ichi-no-tani\r\nshould have been available at the subsequent council of strategists\r\nin Kamakura, and it would have been natural that the younger brother\r\nshould have repaired, as did his elder brother, Noriyori, to the\r\nheadquarters of the clan's chief. Yet Yoshitsune remained at Kyoto,\r\nand that by so doing he should have suggested some suspicions to\r\nYoritomo was unavoidable. The secret of the Court nobles' ability to\r\nexclude the military magnates from any share in State administration\r\nwas no secret in Yoritomo's eyes. He saw clearly that this\r\ndifferentiation had been effected by playing off one military party\r\nagainst the other, or by dividing the same party against itself; and\r\nhe saw clearly that opportunities for such measures had been\r\nfurnished by subjecting the military leaders to constant contact with\r\nthe Court nobility.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he determined to keep two aims always in view. One was to\r\nestablish a military and executive capital entirely apart from, and\r\nindependent of, the Imperial and administrative metropolis; the\r\nother, to preserve the unity of the Minamoto clan in all\r\ncircumstances. Both of these aims seemed to be threatened with\r\nfailure when Yoshitsune preferred the Court in Kyoto to the camp in\r\nKamakura; still more so when he accepted from Go-Shirakawa rank and\r\noffice for which Yoritomo had not recommended him, and yet further\r\nwhen he obtained from the ex-Emperor a commission to lead the\r\nMinamoto armies westward without any reference to, and in despite of,\r\nthe obvious intention of the Minamoto chief at Kamakura.\r\n\r\nAll these acts could scarcely fail to be interpreted by Yoritomo as\r\npreluding the very results which he particularly desired to avert,\r\nnamely, a house of Minamoto divided against itself and the\r\nre-establishment of Court influence over a strong military party in\r\nKyoto. His apprehensions received confirmation from reports furnished\r\nby Kajiwara Kagetoki. Yoritomo trusted this man implicitly. Never\r\nforgetting that Kajiwara had saved his life in the affair of the\r\nhollow tree, he appointed him to the post of military governor and to\r\nthe command of the army destined to drive the Taira from Shikoku\r\nafter the battle of Ichi-no-tani. In that command Kajiwara had been\r\nsuperseded by Yoshitsune, and had moreover been brought into ridicule\r\nin connexion not only with the shipbuilding incident but also, and in\r\na far more flagrant manner, with the great fight at Yashima. He seems\r\nfrom the first to have entertained doubts of Yoshitsune's loyalty to\r\nYoritomo, and his own bitter experiences may well have helped to\r\nconvert those doubts into certainties. He warned Kamakura in very\r\nstrong terms against the brilliant young general who was then the\r\nidol of Kyoto, and thus, when Yoshitsune, in June, 1185, repaired to\r\nKamakura to hand over the prisoners taken in the battle of Dan-no-ura\r\nand to pay his respects to Yoritomo, he was met at Koshigoe, a\r\nvillage in the vicinity, by Hojo Tokimasa, who conveyed to him\r\nYoritomo's veto against his entry to Kamakura. A letter addressed by\r\nYoshitsune to his brother on that occasion ran, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\nHere am I, weeping crimson tears in vain at thy displeasure. Well was\r\nit said that good medicine tastes bitter in the mouth, and true words\r\nring harsh in the ear. This is why the slanders that men speak of me\r\nremain unproved, why I am kept out of Kamakura unable to lay bare my\r\nheart. These many days 1 have lain here and could not gaze upon my\r\nbrother's face. The bond of our blood-brotherhood is sundered.\r\n\r\nBut a short season after I was born, my honoured sire passed to\r\nanother world, and I was left fatherless. Clasped in my mother's\r\nbosom, I was carried down to Yamato, and since that day I have not\r\nknown a moment free from care and danger. Though it was but to drag\r\nout a useless life, we wandered round the capital suffering hardship,\r\nhid in all manner of rustic spots, dwelt in remote and distant\r\nprovinces, whose rough inhabitants did treat us with contumely. But\r\nat last I was summoned to assist in overthrowing the Taira house, and\r\nin this conflict I first laid Kiso Yoshinaka low. Then, so that I\r\nmight demolish the Taira men, I spurred my steed on frowning\r\nprecipices. Careless of death in the face of the foe, I braved the\r\ndangers of wind and wave, not recking that my body might sink to the\r\nbottom of the sea, and be devoured by monsters of the deep. My pillow\r\nwas my harness, arms my trade. [Translated by W. G. Aston.]\r\n\r\nThis letter breathes the spirit of sincerity. But its perusal did not\r\nsoften Yoritomo, if it ever reached his eyes. He steadily refused to\r\ncancel his veto, and after an abortive sojourn of twenty days at\r\nKoshigoe, Yoshitsune returned to Kyoto where his conduct won for him\r\nincreasing popularity. Three months later, Yoritomo appointed him\r\ngovernor of Iyo. It is possible that had not the situation been\r\ncomplicated by a new factor, the feud between the brothers might have\r\nended there. But Minamoto Yukiiye, learning of these strained\r\nrelations, emerged from hiding and applied himself to win the\r\nfriendship of Yoshitsune, who received his advances graciously.\r\nYoritomo, much incensed at this development, sent the son of Kajiwara\r\nKagetoki to Yoshitsune with a mandate for Yukiiye's execution. Such a\r\nchoice of messenger was ill calculated to promote concord.\r\nYoshitsune, pleading illness, declined to receive the envoy, and it\r\nwas determined at Kamakura that extreme measures must be employed.\r\nVolunteers were called for to make away with Yoshitsune, and, in\r\nresponse, a Nara bonze, Tosabo Shoshun, whose physical endowments had\r\nbrought him into prominence at Kamakura, undertook the task on\r\ncondition that a substantial reward be given him beforehand.\r\n\r\nShoshun did not waste any time. On the eighth night after his\r\ndeparture from Kamakura, he, with sixty followers, attacked\r\nYoshitsune's mansion at Horikawa in Kyoto. By wholesale oaths, sworn\r\nin the most solemn manner, he had endeavoured to disarm the\r\nsuspicions of his intended victim, and he so far succeeded that, when\r\nthe attack was delivered, Yoshitsune had only seven men to hold the\r\nmansion against sixty. But these seven were the trusty and stalwart\r\ncomrades who had accompanied Yoshitsune from Mutsu and had shared all\r\nthe vicissitudes of his career. They held their assailants at bay\r\nuntil Yukiiye, roused by the tumult, came to the rescue, and the\r\nissue of Shoshun's essay was that his own head appeared on the\r\npillory in Kyoto. Yoshitsune was awakened and hastily armed on this\r\noccasion by his beautiful mistress, Shizuka, who, originally a\r\ndanseuse of Kyoto, followed him for love's sake in weal and in woe.\r\nTokiwa, Tomoe, Kesa, and Shizuka--these four heroines will always\r\noccupy a prominent place in Japanese history of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nAfter this event there could be no concealments between the two\r\nbrothers. With difficulty and not without some menaces, Yoshitsune\r\nobtained from Go-Shirakawa a formal commission to proceed against\r\nYoritomo by force of arms. Matters now moved with great rapidity.\r\nYoritomo, always prescient, had fully foreseen the course of events.\r\nShoshun's abortive attack on the Horikawa mansion took place on\r\nNovember 10, 1185, and before the close of the month three strong\r\ncolumns of Kamakura troops were converging on Kyoto. In that\r\ninterval, Yoshitsune, failing to muster any considerable force in the\r\ncapital or its environs, had decided to turn his back on Kyoto and\r\nproceed westward; he himself to Kyushu, and Yukiiye to Shikoku. They\r\nembarked on November 29th, but scarcely had they put to sea when they\r\nencountered a gale which shattered their squadron. Yoshitsune and\r\nYukiiye both landed on the Izumi coast, each ignorant of the other's\r\nfate. The latter was captured and beheaded a few months later, but\r\nthe former made his way to Yamato and found hiding-places among the\r\nvalleys and mountains of Yoshino. The hero of Ichi-no-tani and\r\nYashima was now a proscribed fugitive. Go-Shirakawa, whose fate was\r\nalways to obey circumstances rather than to control them, had issued\r\na new mandate on the arrival of Yoritomo's forces at Kyoto, and\r\nKamakura was now authorized to exterminate Yoshitsune with all his\r\npartisans, wherever they could be found.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the capture of Yukiiye, whose fate excites\r\nno pity, the fair girl, Shizuka, was apprehended and brought before\r\nHojo Tokimasa, who governed Kyoto as Yoritomo's lieutenant. Little\r\nmore than a year had elapsed since she first met Yoshitsune after his\r\nreturn from Dan-no-ura, and her separation from him now had been\r\ninsisted on by him as the only means of saving her life. Indifferent\r\nto her own fate, she quickly fell into the hands of Tokimasa's\r\nemissaries and was by them subjected to a fruitless examination,\r\nrepeated with equally abortive results on her arrival at Kamakura.\r\nThere, in spite of her vehement resistance, she was constrained to\r\ndance before Yoritomo and his wife, Masa, but instead of confining\r\nherself to stereotyped formulae, she utilized the occasion to chant\r\nto the accompaniment of her dance a stanza of sorrow for separation\r\nfrom her lover. It is related that Yoritomo's wrath would have\r\ninvolved serious consequences for Shizuka had not the lady Masa\r\nintervened. The beautiful danseuse, being enceinte at the time, was\r\nkept in prison until her confinement. She had the misfortune to give\r\nbirth to a son, and the child was killed by Yoritomo's order, the\r\nmother being released. The slaughter of an innocent baby sounds very\r\nshocking in modern ears, but it is just to remember that the Kamakura\r\nchief and his three younger brothers would all have been executed by\r\nKiyomori had not their escape been contrived by special agencies. The\r\nConfucian doctrine, which had passed into the bushi's code, forbade a\r\nman to live under the same sky with his father's slayer. Deeds like\r\nthe killing of Yoshitsune's son were the natural consequence of that\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Yoshitsune had been passing from one place of concealment\r\nto another in the three contiguous provinces of Izumi, Yamato, and\r\nKii. He escaped deadly peril in the Yoshino region through the\r\ndevotion of Sato Tadanobu, whose brother, Tsuginobu, had died to save\r\nYoshitsune's life in the battle of Yashima. Attacked by the monks of\r\nZo-o-do in overwhelming force, Yoshitsune had prepared to meet death\r\nwhen Tadanobu offered to personify him and hold the position while\r\nYoshitsune escaped. With much difficulty Yoshitsune was induced to\r\nconsent. Tadanobu not only succeeded in covering the retreat of his\r\nchief, but also managed himself to escape to Kyoto where, being\r\ndiscovered, he died by his own hand. Finally, in the spring of 1187,\r\nYoshitsune and his followers, disguised as mendicant friars, made\r\ntheir way up the west coast, and, after hairbreadth escapes, found\r\nasylum in the domain of Fujiwara Hidehira, who had protected\r\nYoshitsune in his youth. Hidehira owned and administered the whole of\r\nthe two provinces of Mutsu and Dewa, which in those days covered some\r\nthirty thousand square miles and could easily furnish an army of a\r\nhundred thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of this great fief had always been an object of keen\r\nsolicitude to Yoritomo. At one time there were rumours that Hidehira\r\nintended to throw in his lot with Yoshinaka; at another, that he was\r\nabout to join hands with the Taira. Yoritomo could never be certain\r\nthat if the Kwanto were denuded of troops for some westward\r\nexpedition, an overwhelming attack might not be delivered against\r\nKamakura from the north. Thus, when he learned that Yoshitsune had\r\nescaped to Mutsu, all his apprehensions were roused. By that time\r\nHidehira had died, in his ninety-first year, but he had committed to\r\nhis son, Yasuhira, the duty of guarding Yoshitsune. Hence, when, in\r\nthe spring of 1188, Kamakura became aware of Yoshitsune's presence in\r\nMutsu, two consecutive messages were sent thither, one from Yoritomo,\r\nthe other from the Court, ordering Yoshitsune's execution. Yasuhira\r\npaid no attention, and Go-Shirakawa commissioned Yoritomo to punish\r\nthe northern chief's contumacy. Yasuhira now became alarmed. He sent\r\na large force to attack Yoshitsune at Koromo-gawa. Benkei and the\r\nlittle band of comrades who had followed Yoshitsune's fortunes\r\ncontinuously during eight years, died to a man fighting for him, and\r\nYoshitsune, having killed his wife and children, committed suicide.\r\nHis head was sent to Kamakura.\r\n\r\nBut this did not satisfy Yoritomo. He wanted something more than\r\nYoshitsune's head; he wanted the great northern fief, and he had no\r\nidea of losing his opportunity. Three armies soon marched northward.\r\nThey are said to have aggregated 284,000 of all arms. One moved up\r\nthe western littoral; another up the eastern, and the third, under\r\nYoritomo himself, marched by the inland route. The men of Mutsu\r\nfought stoutly, but after a campaign of some two months, Yasuhira,\r\nfinding himself in a hopeless position, opened negotiations for\r\nsurrender. His overtures being incontinently rejected, he appreciated\r\nthe truth, namely, that Yoritomo was bent upon exterminating the\r\nFujiwara of the north and taking possession of their vast estates.\r\nThen Yasuhira fled to Ezo, where, shortly afterwards, one of his own\r\nsoldiers assassinated him and carried his head to Yoritomo, who,\r\ninstead of rewarding the man, beheaded him for treachery. Thus, from\r\n1189, Yoritomo's sway may be said to have extended throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of Japan. In the storehouses of the Fujiwara, who,\r\nsince the days of Kiyohira had ruled for a hundred years in the\r\nnorth, there were found piles of gold, silver, and precious stuffs\r\nwith which Yoritomo recompensed his troops.\r\n\r\nYORITOMO'S SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe system of government established by Yeritomo towards the close of\r\nthe twelfth century and kept in continuous operation thereafter until\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth, was known as the Bakufu, a word\r\nliterally signifying \"camp office,\" and intended to convey the fact\r\nthat the affairs of the empire were in the hands of the military.\r\nNone of the great Japanese captains prior to Yoritomo recognized that\r\nif their authority was to be permanent, it must be exercised\r\nindependently of the Court and must be derived from some source\r\noutside the Court. The Taira chief, in the zenith of his career, had\r\nsufficient strength to do as Yoritomo did, and at one moment, that is\r\nto say, when he established his headquarters at Fukuhara, he appears\r\nto have had a partial inspiration. But he never recognized that\r\nwhatever share he obtained in the administration of State affairs was\r\nderived solely from the nature of the office conferred on him by the\r\nCourt, and could never exceed the functions of that office or survive\r\nits loss. The Fujiwara were astuter politicians. By their plan of\r\nhereditary offices and by their device of supplying maidens of their\r\nown blood to be Imperial consorts, they created a system having some\r\nelements of permanency and some measure of independence.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HACHIMAN SHRINE AT KAMAKURA\r\n\r\nBut it was reserved for Yoritomo to appreciate the problem in all its\r\nbearings and to solve it radically. The selection of Kamakura for\r\ncapital was the first step towards solution. Kamakura certainly has\r\ntopographical advantages. It is surrounded by mountains except on one\r\nface, which is washed by the sea. But this feature does not seem to\r\nhave counted so much in Yoritomo's eyes as the fact that his father,\r\nYoshitomo, had chosen Kamakura as a place of residence when he\r\nexercised military sway in the Kwanto, and Yoritomo wished to\r\npreserve the tradition of Minamoto power. He wished, also, to select\r\na site so far from Kyoto that the debilitating and demoralizing\r\ninfluence of the Imperial metropolitan society might be powerless to\r\nreach the military capital. Kamakura was then only a fishing hamlet,\r\nbut at the zenith of its prosperity it had grown to be a city of at\r\nleast a quarter of a million of inhabitants. During a period of one\r\nhundred and fifty years it remained the centre of military society\r\nand the focus of a civilization radically different from that of\r\nKyoto. The Taira had invited their own ruin by assimilating the ways\r\nof the Fujiwara and of the courtiers; the Minamoto aimed at\r\npreserving and developing at Kamakura the special characteristics of\r\nthe buke.\r\n\r\nPOLICY TOWARDS RELIGION\r\n\r\nYoritomo seems to have believed that the Taira had owed their\r\ndownfall largely to divine wrath, in that they had warred against the\r\nmonasteries and confiscated manors belonging to shrines and temples.\r\nHe himself adopted the policy of extending the utmost consideration\r\nto religion, whether Shinto or Buddhism, and to its devotees and\r\ntheir possessions. At Kamakura, though it has well-nigh reverted to\r\nits original rank as a fishing hamlet, there exist to-day eloquent\r\nevidences of the Minamoto chief's reverent mood; among them being the\r\ntemple of Hachiman; a colossal bronze image of Buddha which, in\r\nmajesty of conception and execution, is not surpassed by any idol in\r\nthe world;* a temple of Kwannon, and several other religious\r\nedifices, though the tomb of Yoritomo himself is \"a modest little\r\nmonument covered with creepers.\"\r\n\r\n*This image was not actually erected by Yoritomo, but the project is\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nYORITOMO'S MEMORIAL\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that, after the retreat of the Taira from\r\nFukuhara, in 1183, Go-Shirakawa sent an envoy to Kamakura inviting\r\nYoritomo's presence in Kyoto. Restrained, however, by a sense of\r\ninsecurity,* the Minamoto chief declined to leave Kamakura, and sent\r\nin his stead a memorial to the Throne. This document commenced with a\r\nstatement that the ruin of the Taira had been due not to human\r\nprowess but to divine anger against the plunderers of sacred lands.\r\nTherefore, all manors thus improperly acquired should be at once\r\nrestored to their original owners. Passing on to the case of estates\r\ntaken by the Taira from princes, Court nobles, officials, and private\r\nindividuals, Yoritomo urged that only by full restitution of this\r\nproperty could a sense of security be imparted to the people. \"If any\r\nof these manors be now granted to us, the indignation roused by the\r\nTaira's doings will be transferred simultaneously with the estates.\r\nTo change men's misery to happiness is to remove their resentment and\r\nrepining. Finally,\" the memorial continued, \"if there be any Taira\r\npartisans who desire to submit, they should be liberally treated even\r\nthough their offences deserve capital punishment. I myself was\r\nformerly an offender,** but having had the good fortune to be\r\npardoned, I have been enabled to subdue the insurgents. Thus, even\r\nmen who have been disloyal on the present occasion may serve a loyal\r\npurpose at some future time.\"\r\n\r\n*Kamakura was always exposed to pressure from the north. It had long\r\nbeen proverbial that white the eight provinces of the Kwanto could\r\ndefy the whole empire, 0-U (Oshu and Ushu-Mutsu and Dewa) could defy\r\nthe eight provinces.\r\n\r\n**In allusion to the fact that owing to the Emperor's presence in the\r\ncamp of the Taira during the emeule, the Minamoto occupied the\r\nposition of rebels.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this memorial, Go-Shirakawa ordered that the manors\r\nheld by the Taira in the Tokai-do and Tosan-do should all be restored\r\nto their original owners, the duty of adjudicating in each case being\r\ndelegated to Yoritomo. How much of this admirably conceived document\r\nwas inspired by political acumen we may not venture to judge, but it\r\nis proper to note that the principles enunciated in the memorial\r\nfound expression in the practice of Yoritomo himself. He always\r\nextended clemency to a defeated enemy if he deemed the latter's\r\nsubmission to be sincere, and throughout his whole career he showed a\r\nstrong respect for justice. The men of his time ultimately gave him\r\ncredit for sincerity, and his memorial won universal approval and\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nPOLITY OF THE KAMAKURA BAKUFU\r\n\r\nUnder the Dadka (A.D. 645) system, various administrative organs were\r\ncreated in accordance with Tang models, and a polity at once imposing\r\nand elaborate came into existence. But when the capital was overtaken\r\nby an era of literary effeminacy and luxurious abandonment, the\r\nImperial exchequer fell into such a state of exhaustion that\r\nadministrative posts began to be treated as State assets and bought\r\nand sold like commercial chattels, the discharge of the functions\r\nconnected with them becoming illusory, and the constant tendency\r\nbeing in the direction of multiplication of offices with a\r\ncorresponding increase of red tape. Yoritomo and his councillors\r\nappreciated the evils of such a system and were careful not to\r\nimitate it at Kamakura. They took brevity and simplicity for guiding\r\nprinciples, and constructed a polity in marked contrast with that of\r\nKyoto.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the whole stood the shogun, or commander-in-chief of\r\nthe entire body of bushi, and then followed three sections. They\r\nwere, first, the Samurai-dokoro, which term, according to its literal\r\nrendering, signified \"samurai place\" and may be appropriately\r\ndesignated \"Central Staff Office.\" Established in 1180, its functions\r\nwere to promote or degrade military men; to form a council of war; to\r\ndirect police duties so far as they concerned bushi', to punish\r\ncrime, and to select men for guards and escorts. The president\r\n(betto) obviously occupied a post of prime importance, as he\r\npractically controlled all the retainers (keniri) of the Minamoto\r\nclan and its allied houses. Its first occupant was Wada Yoshimori,\r\nrepresentative of a famous family in the Kwanto, who had greatly\r\ndistinguished himself in the Gen-Hei War. He held the post until the\r\nyear 1213, when, taking up arms against Hojo Yoshitoki, he was\r\ndefeated and killed. Thereafter, it being deemed inadvisable that the\r\nfunctions of such an important office should be delegated\r\nindependently, they were made supplementary to those of the military\r\nregent (shikken), to be presently spoken of.\r\n\r\nMAN-DOKORO\r\n\r\nThe second of the three great sections of the Bakufu polity was the\r\nMandokoro (literally, \"place of administration\"), which, at the time\r\nof its establishment in 1184, was designated Kumon-jo, the change of\r\nname to Man-dokoro being made after Yoritomo's first visit to Kyoto\r\n(1190), when he was nominated gon-dainagon as well as general of the\r\nRight division of the guards (u-kon-e taisho). In fact, the office\r\nMan-dokoro had long existed in the establishment of the civil regent\r\n(kwampaku) at the Imperial capital, and a concession to Kyoto usages\r\nin the matter of nomenclature appealed to Yoritomo's taste for\r\nsimplicity. The Man-dokoro had to discharge the duties and general\r\nbusiness of the Bakufu. Its president was called betto; its\r\nvice-president, rei; there were secretaries, a manager (shitsuji),\r\nwhose functions were mainly financial, and certain minor officials.\r\nOye no Hiromoto was the first president, and the office of shitsuji\r\nbecame hereditary in the Nikaido family.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the betto of the Man-dokoro corresponded to the\r\nregent in the Kyoto polity, the only difference being that the former\r\nofficiated in military government, the latter in civil. The betto of\r\nthe Man-dokoro was, in fact, designated by the alternative name of\r\nshikken (literally, \"holder of authority\") Thus there were two\r\nregents, one in Kyoto, one in Kamakura. In succession to Oye no\r\nHiromoto, the military regency fell to Hojo Tokimasa, and\r\nsubsequently to his son Yoshitoki, who, as shown above, held the post\r\nof betto of the Samurai-dokoro. In short, both offices became\r\nhereditary in the Hojo family, who thus acquired virtually all the\r\npower of the Bakufu. The shikken, standing at the head of the\r\nSamurai-dokoro and the Man-dokoro simultaneously, came to wield such\r\nauthority that even the appointment of the shogun depended upon his\r\nwill, and though a subject of the Emperor, he administered functions\r\nfar exceeding those of the Imperial Court. In the year 1225, a\r\nreorganization of the Man-dokoro was effected. An administrative\r\ncouncil was added (Hyojoshu), the councillors, fifteen or sixteen in\r\nnumber, being composed, in about equal parts, of men of science and\r\nmembers of the great clans. The regent (shikken) presided ex-officio.\r\n\r\nMONJU-DOKORO\r\n\r\nThe third of the Bakufu offices was the Monju-dokoro, or \"place for\r\nrecording judicial inquiries;\" in other words, a high court of\r\njustice and State legislature. Suits at law were heard there and were\r\neither decided finally or transferred to other offices for approval.\r\nThis office was established in 1184. Its president was called\r\nshitsuji (manager), indicating that he ranked equally with the\r\nMan-dokoro official having the same appellation. The first occupant\r\nof the post was Miyoshi Yasunobu. He not only presided over the\r\nMonju-dokoro in a judicial capacity but also attended the meetings of\r\nthe Man-dokoro council (Hyojoshu) ex-officio.\r\n\r\nThis Miyoshi Yasunobu,* as well as the representative of the Nikaido\r\nwho occupied the post of shitsuji in the Man-dokoro; the Oye family,\r\nwho furnished the president of the latter, and the Nakahara, who\r\nserved as the secretaries, were all men of erudition whom Yoritomo\r\ninvited from Kyoto to fill posts in his administrative system at\r\nKamakura. In these unquiet and aristocratically exclusive times,\r\nofficial promotion in the Imperial capital had largely ceased to be\r\nwithin reach of scholastic attainments, and Yoritomo saw an\r\nopportunity to attract to Kamakura men of learning and of competence.\r\nHe offered to them careers which were not open in Kyoto, and their\r\nready response to his invitations was a principal cause of the\r\nsuccess and efficacy that attended the operation of the Bakufu system\r\nin the early days.\r\n\r\n*Miyoshi Yasunobu held the office of chugu no sakan in Kyoto. He was\r\npersonally known to Yoritomo, and he was instrumental in securing the\r\nservices of the astute Oye no Hiromoto, whose younger brother,\r\nChikayoshi, was governor of Aki at the time of receiving Yoritomo's\r\ninvitation. His descendants received the uji of Nagai and Mori; those\r\nof Yasunobu, the uji of Ota and Machine, and those of Chikayoshi, the\r\nuji of Settsu and Otomo.\r\n\r\nHIGH CONSTABLES AND LAND-STEWARDS\r\n\r\nThe most far-reaching change effected by Yoritomo was prompted by Oye\r\nno Hiromoto, at the close of 1185, when, Yoshitsune and Yukiiye\r\nhaving gone westward from Kyoto, the Kamakura chief entertained an\r\napprehension that they might succeed in raising a revolt in the\r\nSanyo-do, in Shikoku, and in Kyushu. He sought advice from the high\r\nofficials of the Bakufu as to the best preventive measures, and Oye\r\nno Hiromoto presented a memorial urging that the Emperor's sanction\r\nbe obtained for appointing in each province a high constable (shugo)\r\nand a land-steward (jito), these officials being nominated from\r\nKamakura, while Yoritomo himself became chief land-steward (so-jito)\r\nand subsequently lord high constable (so-tsuihoshi) for the sixty-six\r\nprovinces. The object of these appointments was to insure that the\r\ncontrol of local affairs should be everywhere in the hands of the\r\nBakufu, whose nominees would thus be in a position to check all\r\nhostile movements or preparations.\r\n\r\nYoritomo recognized the important bearings of this project. He at\r\nonce sent Hojo Tokimasa to guard Kyoto and to submit to the Court a\r\nstatement that it would be far more effective and economical to\r\nprevent acts of insurrection than to deal with them after their full\r\ndevelopment, and that, to the former end, trustworthy local officials\r\nshould be appointed, the necessary funds being obtained by levying\r\nfrom the twenty-six provinces of the Go-Kinai, Sanin, Sanyo, Nankai,\r\nand Saikai a tax of five sho of rice per tan (two bushels per acre).\r\nGo-Shirakawa seems to have perceived the radical character of the\r\nproposed measure. He evinced much reluctance to sanction it. But\r\nYoritomo was too strong to be defied. The Court agreed, and from that\r\nmoment military feudalism may be said to have been established in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the land system fixed by the Daiho-ryo had\r\nfallen into confusion. Private manors existed everywhere, yielding\r\nincomes to all classes from princes to soldiers. In the days of the\r\nFujiwara and the Taira more than one-half of the arable land\r\nthroughout the empire was absorbed into such estates, which paid no\r\ntaxes to anyone except their direct owners. The provincial governor\r\nappointed by the Court gradually ceased to exercise control over the\r\nshoen in his district, unless he happened to be a military man with a\r\nsufficient force of armed retainers (kenin) to assert his authority.\r\nHence it became customary for provincial governors not to proceed in\r\nperson to the place of their function. They appointed deputies\r\n(mokudai), and these limited their duties to the collection of taxes\r\nfrom manors. Lands constituting the domains of great families were\r\nunder the complete control of their holders, and there being no one\r\nresponsible for the preservation of general peace and order, bandits\r\nand other lawbreakers abounded.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs was remedied by the appointment of high\r\nconstables and land-stewards. The high constable had to arrest\r\ninsurgents, assassins, and robbers wherever he found them, and to\r\nmuster the soldiers for service in the Kyoto guards. The land-steward\r\nwas to collect taxes from all private manors. Soon, however, these\r\nfunctions were extended, so that the high constables exercised\r\njudicial and administrative powers, and the land-stewards not only\r\ncollected taxes, and, after deducting their own salaries, handed the\r\nremainder to those entitled to receive it, but also were responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of peace and order within the manors entrusted to\r\ntheir charge. High constables and land-stewards alike were\r\nresponsible to Kamakura alone; they were beyond the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Imperial Court. Thus, the sway of the Minamoto extended\r\nthroughout the whole country. It may be stated at once here that the\r\nlandsteward system did not work altogether satisfactorily. The acts\r\nof these officials created friction in several quarters, and they\r\nwere soon withdrawn from all manors other than those owned or\r\nadministered by Taira. The high constables remained, however, and\r\nwere in full control of local military affairs, the Kamakura chief\r\ncontrolling the whole in his capacity of lord high constable.\r\n\r\nEXEMPTION OF SHRINES AND TEMPLES FROM THE SHUGO SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his policy of special benevolence towards religious\r\ninstitutions, Yoritomo exempted the manors of temples and shrines\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of high constables. Thus military men were not\r\npermitted to make an arrest within the enclosure of a fane, or to\r\ntrespass in any way on its domains, these being tax-free.\r\n\r\nREFORM OF THE COURT\r\n\r\nYoritomo did not confine himself to re-casting the system of\r\nprovincial administration. He extended his reforms to the Court,\r\nalso. Thrice within the short space of five years he had been\r\nproscribed as a rebel by Imperial decree once at the instance of the\r\nTaira; once at the instance of Yoshinaka, and once at the instance of\r\nYoshitsune. In short, the Court, being entirely without military\r\npower of its own, was constrained to bow to any display of force from\r\nwithout. As a means of correcting this state of affairs, Hojo\r\nTokimasa was despatched to the Imperial capital at the close of 1185,\r\nto officiate there as high constable and representative of the\r\nBakufu. A strong force of troops was placed at his disposal, and\r\nefficient means of speedy communications between the east and the\r\nwest were organized. Moreover, a new office, that of scrutator\r\n(nairari), was instituted, and to him were transferred some of the\r\npowers hitherto wielded by the regent (kwampaku). Fujiwara Kanezane\r\nwas the first occupant of this post. Further, a body of twelve\r\ncouncillors (giso), headed by Kanezane, were organized in the\r\ncloistered Emperor's Court (Inchu), and to this council was entrusted\r\nthe duty of discussing and deciding all State affairs. These\r\nimportant steps were taken early in 1186.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, a number of Court officials, including all that had\r\nbeen connected with Yoshitsune and Yukiie, lost their posts, and,\r\nshortly afterwards, Kanezane, becoming regent (kwampaku) in place of\r\nFujiwara Motomichi, co-operated with Oye no Hiromoto in effecting\r\nmany important changes, the latter operating at Kamakura, the former\r\nat Kyoto. It may be noted here that Kanezane's descendants received\r\nthe name of Kujo, those of Motomichi being called Konoe, and the\r\ncustom of appointing the kwampaku alternately from these two families\r\ncame into vogue from that time. All the above reforms having been\r\neffected during the year 1186, the Bakufu recalled Hojo Tokimasa and\r\nappointed Nakahara Chikayoshi to succeed him. But, as the latter was\r\nnot a scion of a military family, the Court desired to have a Hojo\r\nappointed, and Yoritomo acceded by sending Hojo Tokisada.\r\n\r\nPALACES AND FANES\r\n\r\nYoritomo maintained from first to last a reverential attitude towards\r\nthe Throne and towards religion. It has already been shown how\r\ngenerously he legislated in the matter of estates belonging to\r\ntemples and shrines, and we may add that his munificence in that\r\nrespect was stimulated by a terrible earthquake which visited Kyoto\r\nin the autumn of 1185. While the city trembled under repeated shocks,\r\nthe citizens told each other that this was the work of vengeful\r\nspirits of the Taira who, having fallen in the great sea-fight, were\r\nstill without full rites of sepulture. The Kamakura chief seems to\r\nhave accepted that view, for he not only gave substantial\r\nencouragement to the burning of incense and intoning of memorial\r\nSutras, but he also desisted largely from his pursuit of the Taira\r\nsurvivors. Two years later (1187), he sent Oye no Hiromoto to the\r\nImperial capital with authority and ample competence to repair the\r\npalaces there. The city was then infested with bandits, a not\r\nunnatural product of the warlike era. Chiba Tsunetane, specially\r\ndespatched from Kamakura, dealt drastically with this nuisance, and\r\ngood order was finally restored.\r\n\r\nYORITOMO VISITS KYOTO\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of his signal triumphs Yoritomo was invited to\r\nKyoto on several occasions. Various considerations deterred him. He\r\nwished, in the first place, to dispel the popular illusion that the\r\nImperial capital was the centre of all dignity and power. People must\r\nbe taught to recognize that, although Kyoto might be the ultimate\r\nsource of authority, Kamakura was its place of practical exercise. He\r\nwished, in the second place, not to absent himself from Kamakura\r\nuntil he could be absolutely assured that his absence would not\r\nafford an opportunity to his enemies; which sense of security was not\r\nfully reached until the death of Yoshitsune and Fujiwara no Yasuhira,\r\nand the complete subjugation of the great northern fief of Oshti in\r\nthe year 1189. Finally, he wished to appear in Kyoto, not merely as\r\nthe representative of military power, but also as a benefactor who\r\nhad rebuilt the fanes and restored the palaces.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of November, in the year 1190, he set out from Kamakura\r\nand reached Kyoto on December 5th. His armies had shown that, for the\r\npurpose of a campaign, the distance would be traversed in little more\r\nthan half of that time. But Yoritomo's journey was a kind of Imperial\r\nprogress. Attended by a retinue designed to surprise even the\r\ncitizens of the Imperial metropolis, he travelled at a leisurely pace\r\nand made a pause of some duration in Owari to worship at his father's\r\ntomb. The Court received him with all consideration. He had already\r\nbeen honoured with the first grade of the second rank, so that he\r\nenjoyed the right of access to the Presence, and the cloistered\r\nEmperor held with him long conversations, sometimes lasting a whole\r\nday. But Yoritomo did not achieve his purpose. It is true that he\r\nreceived the appointments of gon-dainagon and general of the Right\r\ndivision of the guards. These posts, however, were more objectionable\r\non account of their limitations than acceptable as marks of honour.\r\nTheir bestowal was a mere formality, and Yoritomo resigned them in a\r\nfew days, preferring to be nominated so-tsuihoshi.\r\n\r\nWhat he really desired, however, was the office of sei-i tai-shogun\r\n(barbarian-subduing great general). This high title had been\r\nconferred more than once previously, but only for the purpose of some\r\nfinite and clearly indicated purpose, on the attainment of which the\r\noffice had to be surrendered. The Kamakura chief's plan was to remove\r\nthese limitations, and to make the appointment not only for life but\r\nalso general in the scope of its functions and hereditary in his own\r\nfamily, reserving to the sovereign the formal right of investiture\r\nalone. Go-Shirakawa, however, appreciated the far-reaching effects of\r\nsuch an arrangement and refused to sanction it. Thus, Yoritomo had to\r\ncontent himself with the post of lord high constable of the empire\r\n(so-tsuihoshi), an office of immense importance, but differing\r\nradically from that of sei-i tai-shogun in that, whereas the latter\r\nhad competence to adopt every measure he pleased without reference to\r\nany superior authority, the former was required to consult the\r\nImperial Court before taking any step of a serious nature. The\r\nMinamoto chief returned quietly to Kamakura, but he left many\r\npowerful friends to promote his interests in Kyoto, and when\r\nGo-Shirakawa died, in 1192, his grandson and successor, Go-Toba, a\r\nboy of thirteen, had not occupied the throne more than three months\r\nbefore the commission of sei-i tai-shogun was conveyed to Yoritomo by\r\nspecial envoys. Thereafter it became the unwritten law of the empire\r\nthat the holder of this high post must be either the head of the\r\nprincipal Minamoto family or an Imperial prince.\r\n\r\nNever before had there been such encroachment upon the prerogatives\r\nof the Crown. We have seen that, in the centuries antecedent to the\r\nDaika (A.D. 645) reforms, the sovereign's contact with his subjects\r\nhad been solely through the medium of the o-omi or the o-muraji. By\r\nthese, the Imperial commands were transmitted and enforced, with such\r\nmodifications as circumstances might suggest, nor did the prerogative\r\nof nominating the o-omi or the o-muraji belong practically to the\r\nThrone. The Daika reforms, copying the Tang polity called into\r\nexistence a cabinet and a body of officials appointable or removable\r\nby the sovereign at will, each entrusted with definite functions. But\r\nalmost before that centralized system had time to take root, the\r\nFujiwara grafted on it a modification which, in effect, substituted\r\ntheir own family for the o-omi and the o-muraji of previous times.\r\nAnd now, finally, came the Minamoto with their separate capital and\r\ntheir sei-i tai-shogun, who exercised the military and administrative\r\npowers of the empire with practically no reference to the Emperor.\r\nYoritomo himself was always willing and even careful to envelop his\r\nown personality in a shadow of profound reverence towards the\r\noccupant of the throne, but he was equally careful to preserve for\r\nKamakura the substance of power.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF YORITOMO\r\n\r\nYoritomo lived only seven years after he had reached the summit of\r\nhis ambition. He received the commission of sei-i tai-shogun in the\r\nspring of 1192, and, early in 1199, he was thrown from his horse and\r\nkilled, at the age of fifty-three. He had proceeded to the pageant of\r\nopening a new bridge over the Sagami River, and it was popularly\r\nrumoured that he had fallen from his horse in a swoon caused by the\r\napparition of Yoshitsune and Yukiiye on the Yamato plain and that of\r\nthe Emperor Antoku at Inamura promontory. Just twenty years had\r\nelapsed since he raised the Minamoto standard in Sagami. His career\r\nwas short but meteoric, and he ranks among the three greatest\r\nstatesmen Japan has ever produced, his compeers being Hideyoshi and\r\nIeyasu.\r\n\r\nYORITOMO's CHARACTER\r\n\r\nJapanese historians have written much about this illustrious man.\r\nTheir views may be condensed into the following: Yoritomo was short\r\nin stature with a disproportionately large head. He had a ringing\r\nvoice, gentle manners, an intrepid and magnanimous heart, profound\r\ninsight, and extraordinary caution. The power of imposing his will\r\nupon others was one of his notable characteristics, as was also\r\nmunificence to those that served him. Retainers of the Taira or of\r\nthe Minamoto--he made no distinction. All that swore fealty to him\r\nwere frankly regarded as go-kenin of the Bakufu. Estates were given\r\nto them, whether restored or newly bestowed, and they were treated\r\nmuch as were the hatamoto of the Yedo shogunate in later times. He\r\nspared no pains to preserve Kamakura against the taint of Kyoto's\r\ndemoralizing influences. The bushi of the Kwanto were made the centre\r\nof society; were encouraged to observe the canons of their\r\ncaste--frugality, loyalty, truth, valour, and generosity--canons\r\ndaily becoming crystallized into inflexible laws. When Toshikane,\r\nlord of Chikugo, appeared at the Kamakura Court in a magnificent\r\ncostume, Yoritomo evinced his displeasure by slashing the sleeves of\r\nthe nobleman's surcoat. Skill in archery or equestrianism was so much\r\nvalued that it brought quick preferment and even secured pardon for a\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, neglect of these arts, or conduct unbecoming a\r\nsamurai, was mercilessly punished. When Hayama Muneyori retired to\r\nhis province without accompanying the army sent to attack O-U, he was\r\nseverely censured and deprived of his estates. Cognate instances\r\nmight be multiplied. In the year 1193, the first case of the vendetta\r\noccurred in Japan. Yoritomo organized a grand hunting party on the\r\nmoors at the southern base of Fuji-yama. Among those that accompanied\r\nhim was Kudo Suketsune, who had done to death Soga no Sukeyasu. The\r\nlatter's sons, Sukenari (commonly called Juro) and Tokimune (Goro),\r\nhaving sworn to avenge their father, broke into Yoritomo's camp and\r\ntook the head of their enemy. The elder was killed in the enterprise;\r\nthe younger, captured and beheaded. Yoritomo would fain have saved\r\nGoro's life, though the youth declared his resolve not to survive his\r\nbrother. But the Kamakura chief was constrained to yield to the\r\ndemands of Suketsune's son. He, however, marked his appreciation of\r\nJuro and Goro's filial piety by carefully observing their last\r\ntestament, and by exonerating the Soga estate from the duty of paying\r\ntaxes in order that funds might be available for religious rites on\r\naccount of the spirits of the brothers.\r\n\r\nThis encouragement of fidelity may well have been dictated by selfish\r\npolicy rather than by moral conviction. Yet that Yoritomo took every\r\nconspicuous opportunity of asserting the principle must be recorded.\r\nThus, he publicly declared Yasuhira a traitor for having done to\r\ndeath his guest, Yoshitsune, though in so doing Yasuhira obeyed the\r\norders of Yoritomo himself; he executed the disloyal retainer who\r\ntook Yasuhira's head, though the latter was then a fugitive from the\r\npursuit of the Kamakura armies, and he pardoned Yuri Hachiro, one of\r\nYasuhira's officers, because he defended Yasuhira's reputation in\r\ndefiance of Yoritomo's anger.\r\n\r\nGratitude Yoritomo never failed to practise within the limit of\r\npolicy. Rumour said that he had fallen in his first battle at\r\nIshibashi-yama. Thereupon, Miura Yoshiaki, a man of eighty-nine, sent\r\nout all his sons to search for Yoritomo's body, and closing his\r\ncastle in the face of the Taira forces, fell fighting. Yoritomo\r\nrepaid this loyal service by appointing Yoshiaki's son, Wada\r\nYoshimori, to be betto of the Samurai-dokoro, one of the very highest\r\nposts in the gift of the Kamakura Government. Again, it will be\r\nremembered that when, as a boy of fourteen, Yoritomo had been\r\ncondemned to death by Kiyomori, the lad's life was saved through the\r\nintercession of Kiyomori's step-mother, Ike, who had been prompted by\r\nTaira no Munekiyo. After the fall of the Taira, Yoritomo prayed the\r\nCourt to release Ike's son, Yorimori, and to restore his rank and\r\nestates, while in Munekiyo's case he made similar offers but they\r\nwere rejected.\r\n\r\nTowards his own kith and kin, however, he showed himself implacable.\r\nIn Yoshitsune's case it has been indicated that there was much to\r\nawaken Yoritomo's suspicions. But his brother Noriyori had no\r\nqualities at all likely to be dangerously exercised. A commonplace,\r\nsimple-hearted man, he was living quietly on his estate in Izu when\r\nfalse news came that Yoritomo had perished under the sword of the\r\nSoga brothers. Yoritomo's wife being prostrated by the intelligence,\r\nNoriyori bade her be reassured since he, Noriyori, survived. When\r\nthis came to Yoritomo's ears, doubtless in a very exaggerated form,\r\nhe sent a band of assassins who killed Noriyori. Assassination was a\r\ndevice from which the Kamakura chief did not shrink at all. It has\r\nbeen shown how he sent Tosabo Shoshun to make away with Yoshitsune in\r\nKyoto, and we now see him employing a similar instrument against\r\nNoriyori, as he did also against his half-brother, Zensei. It would\r\nseem to have been his deliberate policy to remove every potential\r\nobstacle to the accession of his own sons. Many historians agree in\r\nascribing these cruelties to jealousy. But though Yoritomo might have\r\nbeen jealous of Yoshitsune, he could not possibly have experienced\r\nany access of such a sentiment with regard to Noriyori or Zensei.\r\n\r\nTowards religion, it would seem that his attitude was sincere. Not in\r\nKyoto and Kamakura alone did he adopt drastic measures for the\r\nrestoration or erection of temples and shrines, but also throughout\r\nthe provinces he exerted his all-powerful influence in the same\r\ncause. He himself contributed large sums for the purpose, and at his\r\ninstance the Courts of the Emperor and of the Bakufu granted special\r\nrights and privileges to bonzes who went about the country collecting\r\nsubscriptions. Thus encouraged, the priests worked with conspicuous\r\nzeal, and by men like Mongaku, Jugen, Eisai, and their comrades not\r\nonly were many imposing fanes erected and many images cast, but also\r\nroads were opened, harbours constructed, and bridges built. Yoritomo\r\nknew what an important part religion had contributed in past ages to\r\nthe country's national development, and he did not neglect to utilize\r\nits services in the interests, first, of the nation's prosperity and,\r\nsecondly, of the Bakufu's popularity. Incidentally all this building\r\nof fanes and restoration of palaces promoted in no small degree the\r\ndevelopment of art, pure and applied. Experts in every line made\r\ntheir appearance, and many masterpieces of architecture and sculpture\r\nenriched the era. These reflected the change which the spirit of the\r\nnation was undergoing in its passage from the delicacy and weakness\r\nof the Fujiwara type to the strength, directness, and dignity of the\r\nbushi's code.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: CANDLE-STICKS\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SAMURAI'S RESIDENCE IN THE KAMAKURA PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE KAMAKURA BAKUFU\r\n\r\nABDICATION OF GO-TOBA\r\n\r\nIN the year 1198, the Emperor Go-Toba abdicated the throne in favour\r\nof his son, who reigned during twelve years (1199-1210) under the\r\nname of Tsuchi-mikado, eighty-third sovereign. Of Go-Toba much will\r\nbe said by and by. It will suffice to note here, however, that his\r\nabdication was altogether voluntary. Ascending the throne in 1184, at\r\nthe age of four, he had passed the next eight years as a mere puppet\r\nmanipulated by his grandfather, Go-Shirakawa, the cloistered Emperor,\r\nand on the latter's death in 1192, Go-Toba fell into many of the\r\nfaults of youth. But at eighteen he became ambitious of governing in\r\nfact as well as in name, and as he judged that this could be\r\naccomplished better from the Inchu (retired palace) than from the\r\nthrone, he abdicated without consulting the Kamakura Bakufu. It is\r\nmore than probable that Yoritomo would have made his influence felt\r\non this occasion had any irregularity furnished a pretext. But the\r\nadvisers of the Kyoto Court were careful that everything should be in\r\norder, and the Kamakura chief saw no reason to depart from his\r\nhabitually reverent attitude towards the Throne.\r\n\r\nYORIIYE, THE LADY MASA, AND HOJO TOKIMASA\r\n\r\nOn the demise of Yoritomo (1199), his eldest son, Yoriiye, succeeded\r\nto the compound office of lord high constable and chief land-steward\r\n(so-shugo-jito), his investiture as shogun being deferred until\r\nKyoto's sanction could be obtained. Yoriiye was then in his\r\neighteenth year, and he had for chief adviser Hatakeyama Shigetada,\r\nappointed to the post by Yoritomo's will. He inherited nothing of his\r\nfather's sagacity. On the contrary, he did not possess even average\r\nability, and his thoughts were occupied almost uniquely with physical\r\npleasures. His mother, Masa, astute, crafty, resourceful, and heroic,\r\nwell understood the deficiency of his moral endowments, but as her\r\nsecond son, Sanetomo, was only seven years old, Yoriiye's accession\r\npresented itself in the light of a necessity. She therefore\r\ndetermined to give him every possible aid. Even during her husband's\r\nlife she had wielded immense influence, and this was now greatly\r\naugmented by the situation. She shaved her head--after the manner of\r\nthe cloistered Emperors--and taking the name of Ni-i-no-ama,\r\nvirtually assumed charge of the Bakufu administration in association\r\nwith her father, Hojo Tokimasa.\r\n\r\nExactly what part this remarkable man acted in the episodes of\r\nYoritomo's career, can never be known. He exerted his influence so\r\nsecretly that contemporary historians took little note of him; and\r\nwhile, in view of his final record, some see in him the spirit that\r\nprompted Yoritomo's merciless extirpation of his own relatives,\r\nothers decline to credit him with such far-seeing cruelty, and hold\r\nthat his ultimately attempted usurpations were inspired solely by\r\nfortuitous opportunity which owed nothing to his contrivance.\r\nWherever the truth may lie as between these views, it is certain that\r\nafter Yoritomo's death, Hojo Tokimasa conspired to remove the\r\nMinamoto from the scene and to replace them with the Hojo.\r\n\r\nTHE DELIBERATIVE COUNCIL\r\n\r\nThe whole coterie of illustrious men--legislators, administrators,\r\nand generals--whom Yoritomo had assembled at Kamakura, was formed\r\ninto a council of thirteen members to discuss the affairs of the\r\nBakufu after his death. This body of councillors included Tokimasa\r\nand his son, Yoshitoki; Oye no Hiromoto, Miyoshi Yasunobu; Nakahara\r\nChikayoshi, Miura Yoshizumi, Wada Yoshimori, Hiki Yoshikazu, and five\r\nothers. But though they deliberated, they did not decide. All final\r\ndecision required the endorsement of the lady Masa and her father,\r\nHojo Tokimasa.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF YORIIYE\r\n\r\nYoriiye had been at the head of the Bakufu for three years before his\r\ncommission of shogun came from Kyoto, and in the following year\r\n(1203), he was attacked by a malady which threatened to end fatally.\r\nThe question of the succession thus acquired immediate importance.\r\nYoriiye's eldest son, Ichiman, the natural heir, was only three years\r\nold, and Yoritomo's second son, Sanetomo, was in his eleventh year.\r\nIn this balance of claims, Hojo Tokimasa saw his opportunity. He\r\nwould divide the Minamoto power by way of preliminary to supplanting\r\nit. Marshalling arguments based chiefly on the advisability of\r\naverting an armed struggle, he persuaded the lady Masa to endorse a\r\ncompromise, namely, that to Sanetomo should be given the office of\r\nland-steward in thirty-eight provinces of the Kwansai; while to\r\nIchiman should be secured the title of shogun and the offices of lord\r\nhigh constable and land-steward in twenty-eight provinces of the\r\nKwanto.\r\n\r\nNow the maternal grandfather of Ichiman was Hiki Yoshikazu, a captain\r\nwho had won high renown in the days of Yoritomo. Learning of the\r\nprojected partition and appreciating the grave effect it must produce\r\non the fortunes of his grandson, Hiki commissioned his daughter to\r\nrelate the whole story to Yoriiye, and applied himself to organize a\r\nplot for the destruction of the Hojo. But the facts came to the lady\r\nMasa's ears, and she lost no time in communicating them to Tokimasa,\r\nwho, with characteristic promptitude, invited Hiki to a conference\r\nand had him assassinated. Thereupon, Hiki's son, Munetomo, assembled\r\nall his retainers and entrenched himself in Ichiman's mansion, where,\r\nbeing presently besieged by an overwhelming force of Tokimasa's\r\npartisans, he set fire to the house and perished with the child,\r\nIchiman, and with many brave soldiers. The death of his son, of his\r\nfather-in-law, and of his brother-in-law profoundly affected Yoriiye.\r\nHe attempted to take vengeance upon his grandfather, Tokimasa, but\r\nhis emissaries suffered a signal defeat, and he himself, being now\r\ncompletely discredited, was constrained to follow his mother, Masa's,\r\nadvice, namely, to take the tonsure and retire to the monastery\r\nShuzen-ji in Izu. There he was followed and murdered by Tokimasa's\r\nagents. It is apparent that throughout these intrigues the lady Masa\r\nmade no resolute attempt to support her first-born. She recognized in\r\nhim a source of weakness rather than of strength to the Minamoto.\r\n\r\nSANETOMO\r\n\r\nAfter Yoriiye's retirement, in 1204, to the monastery in Izu, Masa,\r\nwith the concurrence of her father, Tokimasa, decided on the\r\naccession of her second son, Sanetomo, then in his twelfth year, and\r\napplication for his appointment to the office of shogun having been\r\nduly made, a favourable and speedy reply was received from Kyoto. The\r\nmost important feature of the arrangement was that Hojo Tokimasa\r\nbecame shikken, or military regent, and thus wielded greater powers\r\nthan ever--powers which he quickly proceeded to abuse for\r\nrevolutionary purposes. His policy was to remove from his path, by\r\nany and every measure, all potential obstacles to the consummation of\r\nhis ambition.\r\n\r\nAmong these obstacles were the lady Masa and the new shogun,\r\nSanetomo. So long as these two lived, the Yoritomo family could count\r\non the allegiance of the Kwanto, and so long as that allegiance\r\nremained intact, the elevation of the Hojo to the seats of supreme\r\nauthority could not be compassed. Further, the substitution of Hojo\r\nfor Minamoto must be gradual. Nothing abrupt would be tolerable. Now\r\nthe Hojo chief's second wife, Maki, had borne to him a daughter who\r\nmarried Minamoto Tomomasa, governor of Musashi and lord constable of\r\nKyoto, in which city he was serving when history first takes\r\nprominent notice of him. This lady Maki seems to have been of the\r\nsame type as her step-daughter, Masa. Both possessed high courage and\r\nintellectual endowments of an extraordinary order, and both were\r\nprofoundly ambitious. Maki saw no reason why her husband, Hojo\r\nTokimasa, should lend all his great influence to support the\r\ndegenerate scions of one of his family in preference to the able and\r\ndistinguished representative of the other branch. Tomomasa was both\r\nable and distinguished. By a prompt and vigorous exercise of military\r\ntalent he had crushed a Heike rising in Ise, which had threatened for\r\na time to become perilously formidable. His mother may well have\r\nbelieved herself justified in representing to Hojo Tokimasa that such\r\na man would make a much better Minamoto shogun than the half-witted\r\nlibertine, Yoriiye, or the untried boy, Sanetomo. It has been\r\ninferred that her pleading was in Tokimasa's ears when he sent a band\r\nof assassins to murder Yoriiye in the Shuzen-ji monastery. However\r\nthat may be, there can be little doubt that the Hojo chief, in the\r\nclosing episodes of his career, favoured the progeny of his second\r\nwife, Maki, in preference to that of his daughter, Masa.\r\n\r\nHaving \"removed\" Yoriiye, he extended the same fate to Hatakeyama\r\nShigetada, one of the most loyal and trusted servants of Yoritomo.\r\nShigetada would never have connived at any measure inimical to the\r\ninterests of his deceased master. Therefore, he was put out of the\r\nway. Then the conspirators fixed their eyes upon Sanetomo. The\r\ntwelve-year-old boy was to be invited to Minamoto Tomomasa's mansion\r\nand there destroyed. This was the lady Maki's plan. The lady Masa\r\ndiscovered it, and hastened to secure Sanetomo's safety by carrying\r\nhim to the house of her brother, Yoshitoki. The political career of\r\nHojo Tokimasa ended here. He had to take the tonsure, surrender his\r\npost of regent and go into exile in Izu, where he died, in 1215,\r\nafter a decade of obscurity. As for Minamoto Tomomasa, he was killed\r\nin Kyoto by troops despatched for the purpose. This conflict in 1205,\r\nthough Hojo Tokimasa and Minamoto Tomomasa figured so largely in it,\r\nis by some historians regarded as simply a conflict between the\r\nladies Maki and Masa. These two women certainly occupied a prominent\r\nplace on the stage of events, but the figure behind the scenes was\r\nthe white-haired intriguer, Tokimasa. Had the lady Maki's son-in-law\r\nsucceeded Sanetomo, the former would have been the next victim of\r\nTokimasa's ambition, whereafter the field would have been open for\r\nthe grand climacteric, the supremacy of the Hojo.\r\n\r\nHOJO YOSHITOKI\r\n\r\nCrafty and astute as was Hojo Tokimasa, his son Yoshitoki excelled\r\nhim in both of those attributes as well as in prescience. It was to\r\nthe mansion of Yoshitoki that Sanetomo was carried for safety when\r\nhis life was menaced by the wiles of Tokimasa. Yet in thus espousing\r\nthe cause of his sister, Masa, and his nephew, Sanetomo, against his\r\nfather, Tokimasa, and his brother-in-law, Tomomasa, it is not to be\r\nsupposed that Yoshitoki's motive was loyalty to the house of\r\nYoritomo. On the contrary, everything goes to show that he would have\r\nassociated himself with his father's conspiracy had he not deemed the\r\ntime premature and the method clumsy. He waited patiently, and when\r\nthe occasion arrived, he \"covered his tracks\" with infinite skill\r\nwhile marching always towards the goal of Tokimasa's ambition.\r\n\r\nThe first to be \"removed\" was Wada Yoshimori, whom Yoritomo had\r\ngratefully appointed betto of the Samurai-dokoro. Yoritomo's eldest\r\nson, Yoriiye, had left two sons, Kugyo and Senju-maru. The former had\r\ntaken the tonsure after his father's and elder brother's deaths, in\r\n1204, but the cause of the latter was espoused with arms by a Shinano\r\nmagnate, Izumi Chikahira, in 1213. On Wada Yoshimori, as betto of the\r\nSamurai-dokoro, devolved the duty of quelling this revolt. He did so\r\neffectually, but in the disposition of the insurgents' property, the\r\nshikken, Yoshitoki, contrived to drive Wada to open rebellion. He\r\nattacked the mansion of the shogun and the shikken, captured and\r\nburned the former, chiefly through the prowess of his giant son,\r\nAsahina Saburo; but was defeated and ultimately killed, Senju-maru,\r\nthough only thirteen years old, being condemned to death on the\r\npretext that his name had been used to foment the insurrection! After\r\nthis convenient episode, Yoshitoki supplemented his office of shikken\r\nwith that of betto of the Samurai-dokoro, thus becoming supreme in\r\nmilitary and civil affairs alike.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF SANETOMO\r\n\r\nHow far Sanetomo appreciated the situation thus created there is much\r\ndifficulty in determining. The sentiment of pity evoked by his tragic\r\nfate has been projected too strongly upon the pages of his annals to\r\nleave them quite legible. He had seen his elder brother and two of\r\nthe latter's three sons done to death. He had seen the \"removal\" of\r\nseveral of his father's most trusted lieutenants. He had seen the\r\ngradual upbuilding of the Hojo power on this hecatomb of victims.\r\nThat he perceived something of his own danger would seem to be a\r\nnatural inference. Yet if he entertained such apprehensions, he never\r\ncommunicated them to his mother, Masa, who, from her place of high\r\nprestige and commanding intellect, could have reshaped the issue.\r\n\r\nThe fact would appear to be that Hojo Yoshitoki's intrigues were too\r\nsubtle for the perception of Sanetomo or even of the lady Masa.\r\nYoshitoki had learned all the lessons of craft and cunning that his\r\nfather could teach and had supplemented them from the resources of\r\nhis own marvellously fertile mind. His uniformly successful practice\r\nwas to sacrifice the agents of his crimes in order to hide his own\r\nconnexion with them, and never to seize an opportunity until its\r\npossibilities were fully developed. Tokimasa had feigned ignorance of\r\nhis daughter's liaison with Yoritomo, but had made it the occasion to\r\nraise an army which could be directed either against Yoritomo or in\r\nhis support, as events ordered. There are strong reasons to think\r\nthat the vendetta of the Soga brothers was instigated by Tokimasa and\r\nYoshitoki, and that Yoritomo was intended to be the ultimate victim.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a long series of intrigues which led to the\r\ndeaths of Yoriiye and two of his sons, of Hatakeyama Shigetada, of\r\nMinamoto Tomomasa, of Wada Yoshimori, and of many a minor partisan of\r\nthe Yoritomo family. In the pursuit of his sinister design, there\r\ncame a time when Yoshitoki had to choose between his father and his\r\nsister. He sacrificed the former unhesitatingly, and it is very\r\nprobable that such a choice helped materially to hide from the lady\r\nMasa the true purport of his doings. For that it did remain hidden\r\nfrom her till the end is proved by her failure to guard the life of\r\nSanetomo, her own son, and by her subsequent co-operation with his\r\nslayer, Yoshitoki, her brother. A mother's heart would never\r\nwittingly have prompted such a course.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that Sanetomo provoked the resentment of Masa\r\nand Yoshitoki by accepting high offices conferred on him by\r\nKyoto--chunagon, and general of the Left division of the guards--in\r\ndefiance of Yoritomo's motto, \"Wield power in fact but never in\r\nname,\" and contrary to remonstrances addressed to him through the\r\nagency of Oye no Hiromoto. There is also a tradition that, under\r\npretense of visiting China in the company of a Chinese bonze, Chen\r\nHosiang, he planned escape to the Kinai or Chugoku (central Japan),\r\nthere to organize armed resistance to the Hojo designs. But it is\r\nvery doubtful whether these pages of history, especially the latter,\r\nshould not be regarded in the main as fiction. Sanetomo was too much\r\nof a littérateur to be an astute politician, and what eluded the\r\nobservation of his lynx-eyed mother might well escape his perception.\r\n\r\nIn 1217, Yoshitoki invited Kugyo from Kyoto and appointed him to be\r\nbetto of the shrine of Hachiman (the god of War) which stood on the\r\nhill of Tsurugaoka overlooking the town of Kamakura. Kugyo was the\r\nsecond and only remaining legitimate son of Yoriiye. He had seen his\r\nfather and his two brothers done to death, and he himself had been\r\nobliged to enter religion, all of which misfortunes he had been\r\ntaught by Yoshitoki's agents to ascribe to the partisans of his\r\nuncle, Sanetomo. Longing for revenge, the young friar waited. His\r\nopportunity came early in 1219. Sanetomo, having been nominated\r\nminister of the Left by the Kyoto Court, had to repair to the\r\nTsurugaoka shrine to render thanks to the patron deity of his family.\r\nThe time was fixed for ten o 'clock on the night of February 12th.\r\nOye no Hiromoto, who had cognizance of the plot, hid his guilty\r\nknowledge by offering counsels of caution. He advised that the\r\nfunction should be deferred until daylight, or, at any rate, that the\r\nshogun should wear armour. Minamoto Nakaakira combatted both\r\nproposals and they were rejected. Sanetomo had a vague presentiment\r\nof peril. He gave a lock of his hair to one of his squires and\r\ncomposed a couplet:\r\n\r\n   Though I am forth and gone,\r\n   And tenantless my home;\r\n   Forget not thou the Spring,\r\n   Oh! plum tree by the eaves.\r\n\r\nThen he set out, escorted by a thousand troopers, his sword of State\r\nborne by the regent, Yoshitoki. But at the entrance to the shrine\r\nYoshitoki turned back, pretending to be sick and giving the sword to\r\nNakaakira. Nothing untoward occurred until, the ceremony being\r\nconcluded, Sanetomo had begun to descend a broad flight of stone\r\nsteps that led from the summit of the hill. Then suddenly Kugyo\r\nsprang out, killed Sanetomo and Nakaakira, carrying off the head of\r\nthe former, and, having announced himself as his father's avenger,\r\nsucceeded in effecting his escape. But he had been the agent of\r\nYoshitoki's crime, and his survival would have been inconvenient.\r\nTherefore, when he appealed to the Miura mansion for aid, emissaries\r\nwere sent by the regent's order to welcome and to slay him. Sanetomo\r\nperished in his twenty-eighth year. All accounts agree that he was\r\nnot a mere poet--though his skill in that line was remarkable--but\r\nthat he also possessed administrative talent; that he strove\r\nearnestly to live up, and make his officers live up, to the ideals of\r\nhis father, Yoritomo, and that he never wittingly committed an\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE HOJO REGENCY\r\n\r\nThus, after three generations occupying a period of only forty years,\r\nthe Minamoto family was ruined, and the reins of power were\r\neffectually transferred to Hojo hands. It would seem natural, in the\r\nsequence of events, that the office of shogun should now descend to\r\nthe Hojo. But Yoshitoki understood that such a measure would convict\r\nhim of having contrived the downfall of Yoritomo's progeny in Hojo\r\ninterests. Therefore a step was taken, worthy of the sagacity of the\r\nlady Masa and her brother, the regent. The Bakufu petitioned the\r\nKyoto Court to appoint an Imperial prince to the post of shogun. That\r\nwould have invested the Kamakura Government with new dignity in the\r\neyes of the nation. But the ex-Emperor, Go-Toba, upon whom it\r\ndevolved to decide the fate of this petition, rejected it\r\nincontinently.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, as will presently be seen, was seeking to contrive the\r\ndownfall of the Bakufu, and the idea of associating one of his own\r\nsons with its fortunes must have revolted him. In the face of this\r\nrebuff, nothing remained for the Bakufu except recourse to the\r\ndescendants of the Minamoto in the female line. Yoritomo's elder\r\nsister had married into the Fujiwara family, and her greatgrandson,\r\nYoritsune, a child of two, was carried to Kamakura and installed as\r\nthe head of the Minamoto. Not until 1226, however, was he invested\r\nwith the title of shogun, and in that interval of seven years a\r\nmomentous chapter was added to the history of Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOKYU STRUGGLE\r\n\r\nThe Shokyu era (1219-1222) gave its name to a memorable conflict\r\nbetween Kyoto and Kamakura. Affairs in the Imperial capital were\r\nruled at that time by the ex-Emperor, Go-Toba. We have seen how, in\r\n1198, he abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Tsuchimikado. It is\r\nnot impossible that the idea of rebelling, sooner or later, against\r\nthe Bakufu had begun to germinate in the mind of Go-Toba at that\r\ndate, but the probability is that, in laying aside the sceptre, his\r\ndominant aim was to enjoy the sweets of power without its\r\nresponsibilities, and to obtain leisure for pursuing polite\r\naccomplishments in which he excelled. His procedure, however,\r\nconstituted a slight to the Bakufu, for the change of sovereign was\r\naccomplished without any reference whatever to Kamakura. Tsuchimikado\r\nwas a baby of three at the time of his accession. He had been chosen\r\nby lot from among three sons of Go-Toba, but the choice displeased\r\nthe latter, and in 1210, Tsuchimikado, then in his fifteenth year,\r\nwas compelled to abdicate in favour of his younger brother, Juntoku,\r\naged thirteen, the eighty-fourth occupant of the throne. Again,\r\nKamakura was not consulted; but the neglect evoked no remonstrance,\r\nfor Sanetomo held the post of shogun at the time, and Sanetomo always\r\nmaintained an attitude of deference towards the Imperial Court which\r\nhad nominated him to high office.\r\n\r\nJuntoku held the sceptre eleven years, and then (1221) he, too,\r\nabdicated at his father's request. Very different considerations,\r\nhowever, were operative on this occasion. Go-Toba had now definitely\r\nresolved to try armed conclusions with the Bakufu, and he desired to\r\nhave the assistance of his favourite son, Juntoku. Thus three\r\ncloistered Emperors had their palaces in Kyoto simultaneously. They\r\nwere distinguished as Hon-in (Go-Toba), Chu-in (Tsuchimikado) and\r\nShin-in* (Juntoku). As for the occupant of the throne, Chukyo\r\n(eighty-fifth sovereign) he was a boy of two, the son of Juntoku.\r\nMuch has been written about Go-Toba by romanticists and little by\r\nsober historians. The pathos of his fate tends to obscure his true\r\ncharacter. That he was gifted with exceptional versatility is\r\nscarcely questionable; but that he lacked all the qualities making\r\nfor greatness appears equally certain. That his instincts were so\r\ncruel as to make him derive pleasure from scenes of human suffering,\r\nsuch as the torture of a prisoner, may have been due to a neurotic\r\ncondition induced by early excesses, but it must always stand to his\r\ndiscredit that he had neither judgment to estimate opportunities nor\r\nability to create them.\r\n\r\n*Shin-in signifies the \"original recluse;\" Chu-in, the \"middle\r\nrecluse;\" and Shin-in \"the new recluse.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly summarized, the conditions which contributed mainly to the\r\nShokyu struggle had their origin in the system of land supervision\r\ninstituted by Yoritomo at the instance of Oye no Hiromoto. The\r\nconstables and the stewards despatched by the Bakufu to the provinces\r\ninterfered irksomely with private rights of property, and thus there\r\nwas gradually engendered a sentiment of discontent, especially among\r\nthose who owed their estates to Imperial benevolence. A well-known\r\nrecord (Tai-hei-ki) says: \"In early morn the stars that linger in the\r\nfirmament gradually lose their brilliancy, even though the sun has\r\nnot yet appeared above the horizon. The military families did not\r\nwantonly show contempt towards the Court. But in some districts the\r\nstewards were more powerful than the owners of the estates, and the\r\nconstables were more respected than the provincial governors. Thus\r\ninsensibly the influence of the Court waned day by day and that of\r\nthe military waxed.\"\r\n\r\nThere were other causes also at work. They are thus summarized by the\r\nKamakura Jidaishi: \"The conditions of the time called two parties\r\ninto existence: the Kyoto party and the military party. To the former\r\nbelonged not only many officials of Shinto shrines, priests of\r\nBuddhist temples, and managers of private manors, but also a few\r\nnominal retainers of the Bakufu. These last included men who, having\r\noccupied posts in the Imperial capital for a long time, had learned\r\nto regard the Court with gratitude; others who had special grievances\r\nagainst the Bakufu, and yet others who, having lost their estates,\r\nwere ready to adopt any means of recovering them. The family system\r\nof the time paid no heed to primogeniture. Parents fixed the\r\nsuccession by favouritism, and made such divisions as seemed\r\nexpedient in their eyes. During a parent's lifetime there could be no\r\nappeal nor any remonstrance. But no sooner was a father's tombstone\r\nabout to be erected, than his children engaged in disputes or\r\nappealed to the courts. Therefore the Bakufu, seeking to correct this\r\nevil state of affairs, issued an order that the members of a family\r\nshould be subservient to the directions of the eldest son; which\r\norder was followed, in 1202, by a law providing that disputes between\r\nbrothers must be compromised, and by another, in 1214, ruling that\r\napplications for official posts must have the approval of the members\r\nof the applicants' family in conclave instead of being submitted\r\ndirect, as theretofore. Under such a system of family autocracy it\r\nfrequently happened that men were ousted from all share in their\r\npaternal estates, and these men, carrying their genealogical tables\r\nconstantly in their pockets, were ready to join in any enterprise\r\nthat might better their circumstances. Hence the Shokyu struggle may\r\nbe said to have been, politically, a collision between the Imperial\r\nCourt and the Bakufu, and, socially, a protest against family\r\nautocracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe murder of Sanetomo inspired the Court with strong hope that a\r\nsuicidal feud had commenced at Kamakura, and when the Fujiwara baby,\r\nYoritsune, was sent thither, peace-loving politicians entertained an\r\nidea that the civil and the military administration would soon be\r\nfound co-operating. But neither event made any change in the\r\nsituation. The lady Masa and her brother remained as powerful as ever\r\nand as careless of the Court's dignity.\r\n\r\nTwo events now occurred which materially hastened a rupture. One was\r\nconnected with an estate, in the province of Settsu, conferred by\r\nGo-Toba on a favourite--a shirabyoshi, \"white measure-marker,\" as a\r\ndanseuse of those days was called. The land-steward of this estate\r\ntreated its new owner, Kamegiku, with contumely, and Go-Toba was\r\nsufficiently infatuated to lodge a protest, which elicited from\r\nKamakura an unceremonious negative. One of the flagrant abuses of the\r\ntime was the sale of offices to Court ladies, and the Bakufu's\r\nattitude in the affair of the Settsu estates amounted to an indirect\r\ncondemnation of such evil practices. But Go-Toba, profoundly\r\nincensed, applied himself from that day to mustering soldiers and\r\npractising military tactics. The second incident which precipitated\r\nan appeal to arms was the confiscation of a manor owned by a bushi\r\nnamed Nishina Morito, who, though a retainer (keriin) of the Bakufu,\r\nhad taken service at the Imperial Court. Go-Toba asked that the\r\nestate should be restored, but Yoshitoki flatly refused. It was then\r\n(1221) that Go-Toba contrived the abdication of his son, Juntoku, a\r\nyoung man of twenty-four, possessing, apparently, all the qualities\r\nthat make for success in war, and thereafter an Imperial decree\r\ndeprived Yoshitoki of his offices and declared him a rebel. The die\r\nwas now cast. Troops were summoned from all parts of the Empire to\r\nattack Kamakura, and a motley crowd mustered in Kyoto.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TAKEN BY THE BAKUFU\r\n\r\nIt was on June 6, 1221, that the Imperial decree outlawing Hojo\r\nYoshitoki appeared, and three days later Kamakura was informed of the\r\nevent. The lady Masa at once summoned the leading generals of the\r\nBakufu to her presence and addressed them thus: \"To-day the time of\r\nparting has come. You know well what kind of work the late shogun, my\r\nhusband, accomplished. But slanderers have misled the sovereign and\r\nare seeking to destroy the Kwanto institutions. If you have not\r\nforgotten the favours of the deceased shogun, you will join hearts\r\nand hands to punish the traducers and to preserve the old order. But\r\nif any of you wish to proceed to the west, you are free to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThis astute appeal is said to have moved the generals greatly. There\r\nwas not one instance of disaffection; a sufficiently notable fact\r\nwhen we remember that the choice lay between the Throne and the\r\nBakufu. A military council was at once convened by Yoshitoki to\r\ndiscuss a plan of campaign, and the view held by the great majority\r\nwas that a defensive attitude should be adopted by guarding the\r\nAshigara and Hakone passes.\r\n\r\nAlone, Oye no Hiromoto opposed that programme. Regarding the\r\nsituation from a political, not a strategical, standpoint, he saw\r\nthat every day they remained unmolested must bring an access of\r\nstrength to the Imperial forces, and he strenuously urged that a dash\r\nshould be made for Kyoto at once. Even the lady Masa did not rise to\r\nHiromoto's height of discernment; she advocated a delay until the\r\narrival of the Musashi contingent. Another council was convened, but\r\nHiromoto remained inflexible. He went so far as to urge that the\r\nMusashi chief--Yoshitoki's eldest son, Yasutoki--ought to advance\r\nalone, trusting his troops to follow. Then the lady Masa summoned\r\nMiyoshi Yasunobu and asked his opinion. He said: \"The fate of the\r\nKwanto is at stake. Strike at once.\" Thereupon Hojo Yoshitoki ordered\r\nYasutoki, his son, to set out forthwith from Kamakura, though his\r\nfollowing consisted of only eighteen troopers.\r\n\r\nThereafter, other forces mustered in rapid succession. They are said\r\nto have totalled 190,000. Tokifusa, younger brother of Yasutoki, was\r\nadjutant-general, and the army moved by three routes, the Tokai-do,\r\nthe Tosan-do, and the Hokuriku-do, all converging upon the Imperial\r\ncapital. On the night of his departure from Kamakura, Yasutoki\r\ngalloped back all alone and, hastening to his father's presence,\r\nsaid: \"I have my orders for the disposition of the forces and for\r\ntheir destination. But if the Emperor in person commands the western\r\narmy, I have no orders to guide me.\" Hojo Yoshitoki reflected for a\r\ntime and then answered: \"The sovereign cannot be opposed. If his\r\nMajesty be in personal command, then strip off your armour, cut your\r\nbow-strings, and assume the mien of low officials. But if the Emperor\r\nbe not in command, then fight to the death. Should you be defeated I\r\nwill never see your face again.\"\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE\r\n\r\nWhen they learned that a great army was advancing from the Kwanto,\r\nthe courtiers in Kyoto lost heart at once. There was no talk of\r\nGo-Toba or of Juntoku taking the field. Defensive measures were alone\r\nthought of. The Imperialist forces moved out to Mino, Owari, and\r\nEtchu. Their plan was to shatter the Bakufu columns separately, or,\r\nif that might not be, to fall back and cover the capital. It was a\r\nmost unequal contest. The Kyoto troops were a mere mob without\r\nintelligence or coherence. They broke everywhere under the onset of\r\nthe Kwanto veterans. At the river Uji, where their last stand was\r\nmade, they fought gallantly and obstinately. But their efforts only\r\ndeferred the result by a few hours. On the twenty-fifth day (July 6,\r\n1221) after he had marched out of Kamakura, Yasutoki entered Kyoto.\r\nThe Throne had no hesitation as to the course to be pursued in such\r\ncircumstances. From the palace of the Shin-in a decree was issued\r\nrestoring the official titles of the Hojo chief, and cancelling the\r\nedict for his destruction, while, through an envoy sent to meet him,\r\nhe was informed that the campaign against the Bakufu had been the\r\nwork of irresponsible subjects; that the sovereign did not sanction\r\nit, and that any request preferred by Kamakura would be favourably\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nYasutoki received these gracious overtures with a silent obeisance,\r\nand taking up his quarters at Rokuhara, proceeded to arrest the\r\nleaders of the anti-Bakufu enterprise; to execute or exile the\r\ncourtiers that had participated in it, and to confiscate all their\r\nestates. In thus acting, Yasutoki obeyed instructions from his\r\nimplacable father in Kamakura. He himself evinced a disposition to be\r\nmerciful, especially in the case of the Court nobles. These he sent\r\neastward to the Bakufu capital, which place, however, very few of\r\nthem reached alive, their deaths being variously compassed on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nTo the Imperial family no pity was shown. Even the baby Emperor* was\r\ndethroned, and his place given to Go-Horikawa (1221-1232), the\r\neighty-sixth sovereign, then a boy of ten, son of Morisada, Go-Toba's\r\nelder brother. Go-Toba, himself was banished to the island of Oki,\r\nand Juntoku to Sado, while Tsuchimikado, who had essayed to check the\r\nmovement against the Bakufu, might have remained in Kyoto had not the\r\nexile of his father and brother rendered the city intolerable. At his\r\nown request he was transferred, first, to Tosa, and then, to Awa. The\r\nthree ex-Emperors died in exile. Go-Toba seems to have suffered\r\nspecially from his reverse of fortunes. He lived in a thatched hut\r\nbarely impervious to rain, and his lot is said to have been pitiful,\r\neven from the point of view of the lower orders.\r\n\r\n*To this child, Kanenari, who lived a virtual prisoner in Kyoto for\r\nthirteen years subsequently, the Bakufu declined to give the title of\r\nEmperor. Not until the Meiji Restoration (1870) was he enrolled in\r\nthe list of sovereigns under the name of Chukyo.\r\n\r\nYASUTOKI'S EXPLANATION\r\n\r\nThere had not been any previous instance of such treatment of the\r\nImperial family by a subject, and public opinion was not unnaturally\r\nsomewhat shocked. No little interest attaches, therefore, to an\r\nexplanation given by Yasutoki himself and recorded in the Biography\r\nof Saint Myoe (Myoe Shonin-deri). Visiting the temple after his\r\nvictory, Yasutoki was thus addressed by Myoe:\r\n\r\nThe ancients used to say, \"When men are in multitude they may\r\novercome heaven for a moment, but heaven in the end triumphs.\" Though\r\na country be subdued by military force, calamities will soon overtake\r\nit unless it be virtuously governed. From time immemorial in both\r\nJapan and China sway founded on force has never been permanent. In\r\nthis country, since the Age of Deities down to the present reign, the\r\nImperial line has been unbroken through ninety generations. No prince\r\nof alien blood has ascended the throne. Everything in the realm is\r\nthe property of the Crown. Whatever the Throne may appropriate, the\r\nsubject must acquiesce. Even life must be sacrificed if the cause of\r\ngood government demands it. But you have broken an Imperial army;\r\ndestroyed Imperial palaces; seized the persons of sovereigns;\r\nbanished them to remote regions, and exiled Empresses and princes of\r\nthe Blood. Such acts are contrary to propriety. Heaven will inflict\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nThese words are said to have profoundly moved Yasutoki. He replied: I\r\ndesire to express my sincere views. The late shogun (Yoritomo) broke\r\nthe power of the Heike; restored peace of mind to the Court; removed\r\nthe sufferings of the people, and rendered loyal service to the\r\nsovereign. Among those that served the shogun there was none that did\r\nnot reverence the Emperor. It seems that his Majesty recognized these\r\nmeritorious deeds, for he bestowed ranks and titles. Yoritomo was not\r\nonly appointed dainagon and taisho, but also given the post of\r\nso-tsuihoshi with powers extending to all parts of the empire.\r\nWhenever such honours were offered, he firmly declined to be their\r\nrecipient, his contention being that not for personal reward but for\r\nthe sake of the Throne he had striven to subdue the insurgents and to\r\ngovern the people mercifully. Pressed again and again, however, he\r\nhad been constrained finally to accede, and thus his relatives also\r\nhad benefitted, as my grandfather, Tokimasa, and my father,\r\nYoshitoki, who owed their prosperity to the beneficence of the\r\ncloistered Emperor.\r\n\r\nBut after the demise of his Majesty and of the shogun, the Court's\r\nadministration degenerated. The loyal and the faithful were not\r\nrecognized and often the innocent were punished. When it was reported\r\nthat an Imperial army numbering tens of thousands was advancing\r\nagainst the Kwanto, my father, Yoshitoki, asked my views as to\r\ndealing with it. I replied: \"The Kwanto has been loyal and has erred\r\nin nothing. Yet we are now to be punished. Surely the Court is in\r\nerror? Still the whole country belongs to the sovereign. What is now\r\nthreatened must take its course. There is nothing for us but to bow\r\nour heads, fold our hands, and supplicate for mercy. If,\r\nnevertheless, death be our portion, it will be lighter than to live\r\ndisloyal. If we be pardoned, we can end our lives in mountain\r\nforests.\" My father, after reflecting for a space, answered: \"What\r\nyou say may be right, but it applies only when the sovereign has\r\nproperly administered the country. During the present reign, however,\r\nthe provinces under Imperial sway are in confusion; the peace is\r\ndisturbed, and the people are in misery; whereas those under the\r\nBakufu are peaceful and prosperous. If the administration of the\r\nCourt be extended to all the land, misrule and unhappiness will be\r\nuniversal. I do not resist the mandate for selfish reasons. I resist\r\nit in the cause of the people. For them I sacrifice my life if heaven\r\nbe not propitious. There are precedents. Wu of Chou and Kao-tsu of\r\nHan acted similarly, but, when victorious, they themselves ascended\r\nthe throne, whereas if we succeed, we shall merely set up another\r\nprince of the same dynasty. Amaterasu and Hachiman will not reproach\r\nus. We will punish only the evil councillors who have led the Throne\r\nastray. You will set out with all expedition.\"\r\n\r\nThus instructed, I took the road to Kyoto. But before departing, I\r\nwent to worship at the shrine of Hachiman. There I prayed that if my\r\ntaking the field was improper, I might be struck dead forthwith; but\r\nthat if my enterprise could in any wise aid the country, bring peace\r\nto the people, and contribute to the prosperity of the shrines and\r\ntemples, then might I receive the pity and sympathy of heaven. I took\r\noath before the shrine of Mishima Myojin, also, that my purpose was\r\nfree from all selfish ambition. Thus, having placed my life in the\r\nhand of heaven, I awaited my fate. If to this day I have survived all\r\nperil, may I not regard it as an answer to my prayer?\r\n\r\nA difference will be detected between the views here attributed to\r\nYoshitoki and his previously narrated instructions to his son,\r\nYasutoki. There can be little doubt that the record in the Myoe\r\nShonin-den is the correct version. Yoshitoki obeyed the Chinese\r\npolitical ethics; he held that a sovereign had to answer for his\r\ndeeds at the bar of public opinion. Yasutoki's loyalty was of a much\r\nmore whole-hearted type: he recognized the occupant of the throne as\r\naltogether sacrosanct. If he obeyed his father's instructions in\r\ndealing with the Court, he condemned himself to the constant\r\ncompanionship of regret, which was reflected in the excellence of his\r\nsubsequent administration.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES\r\n\r\nBy the Shokyu war the camera system of administration (Insei) at the\r\nCourt was destroyed, and a great change took place in the relations\r\nof the Throne to the Bakufu. For, whereas the latter's authority in\r\nKyoto had hitherto been largely nominal, it now became a supreme\r\nreality. Kamakura had been represented in the Imperial capital by a\r\nhigh constable only, whereas two special officials, called\r\n\"inquisitors\" (tandai) were now appointed, and the importance\r\nattaching to the office becomes apparent when we observe that the\r\nfirst tandai were Yasutoki himself and his uncle, Tokifusa. They\r\npresided over administrative machinery at the two Rokuhara--in the\r\nnorthern and southern suburbs of the city--organized exactly on the\r\nlines of the Kamakura polity; namely, a Samurai-dokoro, a Man-dokoro,\r\nand a Monju-dokoro. Further, in spite of imposing arrangements in\r\nKyoto, no question was finally decided without previous reference to\r\nKamakura, which thus became, in very truth, the administrative\r\nmetropolis of the empire.\r\n\r\nTHE SHIMPO-JITO\r\n\r\nWhen Yoritomo appointed retainers of his own to be land-stewards in\r\nthe various manors, these officials did not own the estates where\r\nthey were stationed; they merely collected the taxes and exercised\r\ngeneral supervision. After the Shokyu struggle, however, some three\r\nthousand manors, hitherto owned by courtiers hostile to the Bakufu,\r\nwere confiscated by the latter and distributed among the Minamoto,\r\nthe Hojo, and their partisans. The recipients of these estates were\r\nappointed also to be their land-stewards, and thus there came into\r\nexistence a new class of manor-holders, who were at once owners and\r\njito, and who were designated shimpo-jito, or \"newly appointed\r\nland-stewards,\" to distinguish them from the hompo-jito, or\r\n\"originally appointed.\"\r\n\r\nThese shimpo-jito, in whom were vested at once the rights of\r\nownership and of management, were the first genuine feudal chiefs in\r\nJapan--prototypes of the future daimyo and shomyo. It should be here\r\nnoted that, in the distribution of these confiscated estates, the\r\nKamakura regent, Yoshitoki, did not benefit to the smallest extent;\r\nand that the grants made to the two tandai in Kyoto barely sufficed\r\nto defray the charges of their administrative posts. Yoshitoki is, in\r\ntruth, one of the rare figures to whom history can assign the credit\r\nof coveting neither wealth nor station. Out of the three thousand\r\nmanors that came into his hands as spolia opima of the Shokyu war, he\r\nmight have transferred as many as he pleased to his own name; and\r\nwielding absolute authority in Kyoto, he could have obtained any\r\ntitle he desired. Yet he did not take a rood of land, and his\r\nofficial status at the time of his death was no higher than the\r\nfourth rank.\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDERS OF THE BAKUFU\r\n\r\nThe great statesmen, legislators, and judges who contributed so much\r\nto the creation of the Bakufu did not long survive the Shokyu\r\nstruggle. Miyoshi Yasunobu, who presided over the Department of\r\nJustice (Monju-dokoro) from the time of its establishment, had been\r\nattacked by mortal sickness before the Imperial army commenced its\r\nmarch eastward. His last advice was given to the lady Masa when he\r\ncounselled an immediate advance against Kyoto. Soon afterwards he\r\ndied at the age of eighty-two. The great Oye no Hiromoto, who\r\ncontributed more than any other man to the conception and\r\norganization of the Kamakura system, and of whom history says that\r\nwithout him the Minamoto had never risen to fame, survived his\r\ncolleague by only four years, dying, in 1225, at the age of\r\nseventy-eight. The lady Masa, one of the world's heroines, expired in\r\nthe same year, and 1224 had seen the sudden demise of the regent,\r\nHojo Yoshitoki. Fortunately for the Bakufu, the regent's son,\r\nYasutoki, proved himself a ruler of the highest ability, and his\r\nimmediate successors were not less worthy of the exalted office they\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SILK TASSEL\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ITSUKUSHIMA JINJA (SHRINE), AT MIYAJIMA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE HOJO\r\n\r\nTHE HOJO IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nTHERE was nothing perfunctory in the administration of the \"Two\r\nRokuhara\" (Ryo-Rokuhara) in Kyoto. The northern and the southern\r\noffices were presided over by the most prominent members of the Hojo\r\nfamily, men destined to fill the post of regent (shikkeri)\r\nsubsequently in Kamakura. Thus, when Hojo Yoshitoki died suddenly, in\r\n1224, his son, Yasutoki, returned at once to Kamakura to succeed to\r\nthe regency, transferring to his son, Tokiuji, the charge of northern\r\nRokuhara, and a short time afterwards the control of southern\r\nRokuhara was similarly transferred from Yoshitoki is brother,\r\nTokifusa, to the latter's son, Tokimori. Nominally, the jurisdiction\r\nof the two Rokuhara was confined to military affairs, but in reality\r\ntheir influence extended to every sphere within Kyoto and to the\r\nKinai and the Saikai-do without.\r\n\r\nTHE HYOJOSHU\r\n\r\nSo long as the lady Masa lived, the administrative machinery at\r\nKamakura suggested no sense of deficiency. That great woman accepted\r\nall the responsibility herself. But in the year (1225) of her death,\r\nYasutoki, who had just succeeded to the regency, made an important\r\nreform. He organized within the Man-dokoro a council of fifteen or\r\nsixteen members, which was called the Hyojo-shu, and which virtually\r\nconstituted the Bakufu cabinet. The Samurai-dokoro and the\r\nMonju-dokoro remained unchanged, but the political administration\r\npassed from the Monju-dokoro to the Hyojoshu, and the betto of the\r\nformer became in effect the finance minister of the shogun.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD ADMINISTRATION OF THE HOJO\r\n\r\nCommencing with Yasutoki (1225), down to the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, Japan was admirably ruled by a succession of Hojo regents.\r\nAmong them, Yasutoki deserves the highest credit, for he established\r\na standard with the aid of very few guiding precedents. When he came\r\ninto power he found the people suffering grievously from the\r\nextortions of manorial chiefs. It was not an uncommon practice for\r\nthe owner of an estate to hold in custody the wives and daughters of\r\ndefaulting tenants until the latter paid their rents, however\r\nexorbitant, and seldom indeed did the holder of a manor recognize any\r\nduty of succouring the peasants in time of distress. The former cruel\r\npractice was strictly forbidden by Yasutoki, and, to correct the\r\nlatter defect, he adopted the plan of setting a fine example himself.\r\nIt is recorded that in the Kwanki era (1229-1232), when certain\r\nplaces were suffering from crop failure, the regent distributed nine\r\nthousand koku of rice (45,000 bushels approximately) among the\r\ninhabitants and remitted all taxes throughout more than one thousand\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nIn the Azuma Kagami, a contemporaneous history generally trustworthy,\r\nwe find various anecdotes illustrative at once of the men and the\r\nethics of the time. Thus, it is related that the farmers of a village\r\ncalled Hojo being in an embarrassed condition, seed-rice was lent to\r\nthem in the spring by the regent's order, they undertaking to repay\r\nit in the autumn. But a storm having devastated their fields, they\r\nwere unable to keep their pledge. Nothing seemed to offer except\r\nflight. When they were on the eve of decamping, however, they\r\nreceived from Yasutoki an invitation to a feast at which their bonds\r\nwere burned in their presence and every debtor was given half a\r\nbushel of rice. Elsewhere, we read that the regent himself lived in a\r\nhouse so unpretentious that the interior was visible from the\r\nhighroad, owing to the rude nature of the surrounding fence. Urged to\r\nmake the fence solid, if only as a protection against fire, his reply\r\nwas: \"However economically a new wall and fence be constructed, the\r\noutlay would be at the cost of the people. As for me, if I do my duty\r\nto the State, my life and my house will be safe. If I fail, the\r\nstrongest fence will not avail.\"\r\n\r\nIn estimating what his bountiful assistance to the farmers meant, it\r\nis necessary to remember that he was very poor, The greater part of\r\nthe comparatively small estates bequeathed to him by his father he\r\ndivided among his half-brothers by a Fujiwara mother, reserving to\r\nhimself only a little, for, said he: \"I am the regent. What more do I\r\ndesire?\" One day, while attending a meeting of the Hyojoshu, he\r\nreceived news that the house of his brother, Tomotoki, was attacked.\r\nImmediately he hastened to the rescue with a small band of followers.\r\nSubsequently, one of his principal retainers remonstrated with him\r\nfor risking his life in an affair so insignificant. Yasutoki\r\nanswered: \"How can you call an incident insignificant when my\r\nbrother's safety was concerned? To me it seemed as important as the\r\nShokyu struggle. If I had lost my brother, what consolation would my\r\nrank have furnished?\"\r\n\r\nYasutoki never made his rank a pretext for avoiding military service;\r\nhe kept his watch in turn with the other guards, remaining up all\r\nnight and attending to all his duties. When he periodically visited\r\nthe temple of Yoritomo, he always worshipped without ascending to the\r\naisle, his reason being that, were the shogun, Yoritomo, alive, the\r\nregent would not venture to sit on the dais by his side. Thrifty and\r\neminently practical, he ridiculed a priest who proposed to\r\ntranquillize the nation by building fanes. \"How can peace be brought\r\nto the people,\" he asked, \"by tormenting them to subscribe for such a\r\npurpose?\" He revered learning, regarded administration as a literary\r\nart rather than a military, and set no store whatever by his own\r\nability or competence.\r\n\r\nTHE JOEI CODE\r\n\r\nThe most memorable achievement during Yasutoki's regency was the\r\ncompilation of a code of law called the Joei Shikimoku* after the\r\nname of the era (Joei, 1232-1233) when it was promulgated. What\r\nrendered this legislation essentially necessary was that the Daiho\r\ncode of the eighth century and all the laws founded on it were\r\ninspired primarily by the purpose of centralizing the administrative\r\npower and establishing the Throne's title of ownership in all the\r\nland throughout the realm, a system diametrically opposed to the\r\nspirit of feudalism. This incongruity had made itself felt in\r\nYoritomo's time, and had suggested the compilation of certain \"Rules\r\nfor Decisions\" (Hanketsu-rei), which became the basis of the Joei\r\ncode in Yasutoki's days. Another objection to the Daiho code and its\r\ncorrelated enactments was that, being written with Chinese ideographs\r\nsolely, they were unintelligible to the bulk of those they concerned.\r\nConfucius laid down as a fundamental maxim of government that men\r\nshould be taught to obey, not to understand, and that principle was\r\nadopted by the Tokugawa in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\nBut in the thirteenth, the aim of Yasutoki and his fellow legislators\r\nwas to render the laws intelligible to all, and with that object they\r\nwere indited mostly in the kana syllabary.\r\n\r\n*Called also the Kwanto Goseibai Shikimoku.\r\n\r\nThe actual work of compilation was done by Hokkyo Enzen (a renowned\r\nbonze), but the idea originated with Hojo Yasutoki and Miyoshi\r\nYasutsura, and every provision was carefully scanned and debated by\r\nthe Bakufu's State council (Hyojoshu). There was no intention of\r\nsuppressing the Daiho code. The latter was to remain operative in all\r\nregions to which the sway of the Kyoto Court extended direct. But in\r\nproportion as the influence of the Bakufu grew, the Joei laws\r\nreceived new adherents and finally became universally effective. A\r\ngreat modern authority, Dr. Ariga, has opined that the motive of the\r\nBakufu legislation was not solely right for right's sake. He thinks\r\nthat political expediency figured in the business, the Kamakura\r\nrulers being shrewd enough to foresee that a reputation for\r\nadministering justice would prove a potent factor in extending their\r\ninfluence. If so, the scheme was admirably worked out, for every\r\nmember of the council had to sign a pledge, inserted at the end of\r\nthe Shikimoku, invoking* the vengeance of heaven on his head if he\r\ndeparted from the laws or violated their spirit in rendering\r\njudgment. Nothing, indeed, stands more signally to the credit of the\r\nBakufu rulers from the days of Yoritomo and his wife, Masa,\r\ndownwards, than their constant endeavour to do justice between man\r\nand man.\r\n\r\n*\"This oath indicates, among other things, the deep sense of the\r\nimportance of unanimity, of a united front, of the individual sharing\r\nfully in the collective responsibility, that was cherished by the\r\nBakufu councillors. This was, indeed, one of the chief secrets of the\r\nwonderful stability and efficiency of the machine.\" (Murdoch.)\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE CODE\r\n\r\nThe Joei Shikimoku is not a voluminous document: it contains only\r\nfifty-one brief articles, which the poet Basho compares to the\r\nluminosity of the full moon. It has been excellently translated and\r\nannotated by Mr. Consul-General J. C. Hall in the \"Transactions of\r\nthe Asiatic Society of Japan\" (Vol. XXXIV, Part I), and Mr. J.\r\nMurdoch, in his admirable History of Japan, summarizes its provisions\r\nlucidly. We learn that slavery still existed in the thirteenth\r\ncentury in Japan; but the farmer was guarded against cruel processes\r\nof tax-collecting and enjoyed freedom of domicile when his dues were\r\npaid. Fiefs might not be sold, but a peasant might dispose of his\r\nholding. \"Village headmen, while held to a strict discharge of their\r\nduties and severely punished for various malpractices, were\r\nsafeguarded against all aggression or undue interference on the part\r\nof the jito. The law of property was almost entirely synonymous with\r\nthat of fiefs. These, if originally conferred for public services\r\nrendered by the grantee, could not be sold. On the death of the\r\nholder it was not necessarily the eldest son--even though\r\nlegitimate--that succeeded. The only provision affecting the father's\r\ncomplete liberty of bequest or gift to his widow--or concubine, in\r\none article--or children, was that a thoroughly deserving eldest son,\r\nwhether of wife or concubine, could claim one-fifth of the estate.\r\n\r\n\"Not only could women be dowered with, or inherit, fiefs, and\r\ntransmit a legal title to them to their own children, but a childless\r\nwoman was even fully empowered to adopt an heir. Yoritomo had been\r\nthe first to sanction this broadminded and liberal principle. In\r\nKamakura, an adulterer was stripped of half of his fief if he held\r\none; and if he had none, he was banished. For an adulteress the\r\npunishment was no severer, except that if she possessed a fief, the\r\nwhole of it was confiscated. A good many sections of the code deal\r\nwith legal procedure and the conduct and duty of magistrates, the\r\ngreat objects being to make the administration of justice simple,\r\nprompt, and pure, while repressing everything in the shape of\r\npettifogging or factious litigation.\r\n\r\n\"The penalties were neither cruel nor ferocious. Death for the worst\r\noffences--among which theft is specially mentioned--confiscation of\r\nfief, and banishment, these exhaust the list. The only other\r\npunishment mentioned is that of branding on the face, inflicted on a\r\ncommoner for the crime of forgery, a bushi's punishment in this case\r\nbeing banishment, or simply confiscation of his fief, if possessed of\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"Bakufu vassals were strictly forbidden directly to solicit the\r\nImperial Court for rank or office; they must be provided with a\r\nspecial recommendation from Kamakura. But once invested with Court\r\nrank, they might be promoted in grade without any further\r\nrecommendation, while they were free to accept the position of\r\nhebiishi. Analogous restrictions were placed on the Kwanto clergy,\r\nwho were to be summarily removed from their benefices if found\r\nappealing to Kyoto for promotion, the only exception being in favour\r\nof Zen-shu priests. In their case the erring brother guilty of such\r\nan offence got off comparatively lightly--'an influential member of\r\nthe same sect will be directed to administer a gentle admonition.'\r\nThe clergy within the Bakufu domains were to be kept strictly in\r\nhand; if they squandered the revenues of their incumbency and\r\nneglected the fabric and the established services therein, they were\r\nto be displaced. As regards the monasteries and priests outside the\r\nBakufu domain, the case was entirely different; they were virtually\r\nindependent, and Kamakura interfered there only when instructed to do\r\nso by Imperial decree.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nFURTHER LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that the Joei Shikimoku represents the whole\r\noutcome of Kamakura legislation. Many additions were made to the code\r\nduring the fourteenth century, but they were all in the nature of\r\namplifications or modifications. Kyoto also was busy with enactments\r\nin those times--busier, indeed, than Kamakura, but with smaller\r\npractical results.\r\n\r\nFALL OF THE MIURA\r\n\r\nYasutoki died in 1242, having held the regency (shikken) for eighteen\r\nyears. His two sons had preceded him to the grave, and therefore his\r\ngrandson, Tsune-toki, became shikken. Tsunetoki resembled his\r\ngrandfather in many respects, but, as he died in 1246, he had little\r\nopportunity of distinguishing himself. Nevertheless, during his brief\r\ntenure of power, he took a step which had momentous consequences. It\r\nwill be remembered that after the murder of Minamoto Sanetomo by his\r\nnephew Kugyo, in 1219, some difficulty was experienced in persuading\r\nthe Imperial Court to appoint a successor to the shogunate, and\r\nfinally the choice fell upon Fujiwara Yoritsune, then a child of two,\r\nwho was not actually nominated shogun until 1226. This noble, when\r\n(1244) in the twenty-seventh year of his age and the eighteenth of\r\nhis shogunate, was induced by the regent, Tsunetoki, to resign, the\r\nalleged reason being portents in the sky, and a successor was found\r\nfor him in his son, Yoritsugu.\r\n\r\nNow, for many years past the Miura family had ranked next to the Hojo\r\nin power and above it in wealth, but the two had always been loyal\r\nfriends. Some umbrage was given to the Miura at this time, however,\r\nowing to the favours enjoyed at the regency by the Adachi family, one\r\nof whose ladies was the mother of the two shikken, Tsunetoki and\r\nTokiyori. The situation thus created had its issue in a plot to kill\r\nTokiyori, and to replace him by an uncle unconnected with the Adachi.\r\nWhether the Miura family were really involved in this plot, history\r\ngives no definite indication; but certainly the ex-shogun, Yoritsune,\r\nwas involved, and his very marked friendship with Miura Mitsumura\r\ncould scarcely fail to bring the latter under suspicion. In the end,\r\nthe Miura mansion was suddenly invested by a Hojo force. Mitsumura\r\nand his elder brother, Yasumura, escaped to a temple where, after a\r\nstubborn resistance, they and 270 of their vassals committed suicide.\r\nNo mercy was shown. The Miura were hunted and slaughtered everywhere,\r\ntheir wide, landed estates being confiscated and divided among the\r\nBakufu, the fanes, and the courtiers at Kyoto.\r\n\r\nThe terribly drastic sequel of this affair illustrates the vast power\r\nwielded by the Hojo throughout the empire in the thirteenth century.\r\nYoritomo's system of high constables and land-stewards brought almost\r\nevery part of the country under the effective sway of Kamakura. It is\r\nnot to be supposed, however, that these high constables and\r\nland-stewards were suffered to subject the people within their\r\njurisdiction to arbitrary or extortionate treatment. Not only could\r\ncomplaints of any such abuses count on a fair hearing and prompt\r\nredress at the hands of the Bakufu, but also inspectors were\r\ndespatched, periodically or at uncertain dates, to scrutinize with\r\nthe utmost vigilance the conduct of the shugo and jito, who, in their\r\nturn, had a staff of specially trained men to examine the land survey\r\nand adjust the assessment and incidence of taxation.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HOJO TOKIYORI\r\n\r\nHOJO TOKIYORI\r\n\r\nTokiyori, younger brother of Tsunetoki, held the post of shikken at\r\nthe time of the Miura tragedy. He had succeeded to the position, in\r\n1246, on the death of Tsunetoki, and he nominally abdicated in 1256,\r\nwhen, in the sequel of a severe illness, he took the tonsure. A\r\nzealous believer, from his youth upwards, in the doctrines of the Zen\r\nsect of Buddhism, he built a temple called Saimyo-ji among the hills\r\nof Kamakura, and retired thither to tend his health--entrusting the\r\noffice of shikken to a relative, Nagatoki, as his own son, Tokimune,\r\nwas still of tender age--but continuing himself to administer\r\nmilitary and judicial affairs, especially when any criminal or civil\r\ncase of a complicated or difficult nature occurred. Thus, there was a\r\ncloistered regent at Kamakura, just as there had so often been a\r\ncloistered Emperor in Kyoto. Tradition has busied itself much with\r\nTokiyori's life. He carried to extreme lengths the virtue of economy\r\nso greatly extolled by his grandfather, Yasutoki. Such was the\r\nfrugality of his mode of life that we read of him searching for\r\nfragments of food among the remnants of a meal, so that he might\r\nserve them to a friend, and we read, also, of his mother repairing\r\nwith her own hands the paper covering of a shoji in expectation of a\r\nvisit from him. He is further said to have disguised himself as an\r\nitinerent bonze and to have travelled about the provinces, observing\r\nthe state of the people and learning their complaints. His\r\nexperiences, on this pilgrimage read like a romance. Lodging at one\r\ntime with an aged widow, he learns that she has been robbed of her\r\nestate and reduced to painful poverty, a wrong which Tokiyori hastens\r\nto redress; at another time his host is an old samurai whose loyal\r\nrecord comes thus to the knowledge of the shikken and is subsequently\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed that these tales rest on very slender\r\nevidence. Better attested is the story of Aoto Fujitsuna, which\r\nillustrates at once the character of Tokiyori and the customs of the\r\ntime. This Fujitsuna was a man of humble origin but considerable\r\nlearning. One year, the country being visited by drought, Tokiyori\r\ngave rice and money to priests for religious services, and himself\r\nworshipped at the shrine of Mishima. These measures were vehemently\r\ncriticized by Fujitsuna, who described them as enriching the wealthy\r\nto help the impoverished. When informed of this, Tokiyori, instead of\r\nresenting it, sent for Fujitsuna and nominated him a member of the\r\nCourt of Recorders,* where he earned the reputation of being one of\r\nJapan's greatest judges.** It is related of him that he devoted his\r\nwhole fortune to objects of charity, and that when Tokiyori, claiming\r\na revelation from heaven, proposed to increase his endowments, his\r\nanswer was, \"Supposing heaven revealed to you that you should put me\r\nto death, would you obey?\" ***\r\n\r\n*The Hikitsuke-shii, a body of men who kept the archives of the\r\nMan-dokoro and conducted preliminary judicial investigations. It was\r\norganized in Tokiyori's, time and from its members the Hyojoshu was\r\nrecruited.\r\n\r\n**The other was Ooka Tadasuke of the Tokugawa period.\r\n\r\n***It is related of this Aoto Fujitsuna that, having dropped a few\r\ncash into the Namera River at night, he expended many times the\r\namount in paying torch-bearers to recover the lost coins, his\r\nargument being that the money thus expended was merely put into\r\ncirculation, whereas the dropped money would have been irrevocably\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nTokiyori, as already related, though he nominally resigned and\r\nentered religion in 1256, really held the reins of power until his\r\ndeath, in 1263. Thus the Insei (camera administration) came into\r\nbeing in Kamakura, as it had done previously in Kyoto. There were\r\naltogether nine of the Hojo regents, as shown below:\r\n\r\n(1) Tokimasa  1203-1205\r\n\r\n(2) Yoshitoki 1205-1224\r\n\r\n(3) Yasutoki  1224-1242\r\n\r\n(4) Tsunetoki 1242-1246\r\n\r\n(5) Tokiyori  1246-1256  Retired in 1256, but ruled in camera till\r\n1263\r\n\r\n(6) Tokimune  1256-1284\r\n\r\n(7) Sadatoki  1284-1301  Retired in 1301, but ruled in camera till\r\n1311\r\n\r\n(8) Morotoki  1301-1311\r\n\r\n(9) Takatoki  1311-1333\r\n\r\nThe first six of these were men of genius, but neither Tokimasa nor\r\nYoshitoki can be called really great administrators, if in the\r\nscience of administration its moral aspects be included. The next\r\nfour, however, from Yasutoki down to Tokimune, are distinctly\r\nentitled to a high place in the pages of history. Throughout the\r\nsixty years of their sway (1224-1284), the Japanese nation was\r\ngoverned with justice* and clemency rarely found in the records of\r\nany medieval State, and it is a strange fact that Japan's debt to\r\nthese Hojo rulers remained unrecognized until modern times.\r\n\r\n*It is recorded that the first half of every month in Kamakura was\r\ndevoted to judicial proceedings, and that at the gate of the Record\r\nOffice there was hung a bell, by striking which a suitor or\r\npetitioner could count on immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOGUNS IN KAMAKURA\r\n\r\nIn the Minamoto's original scheme of government the office of shogun\r\nwas an administrative reality. Its purpose was to invest the Bakufu\r\nchief with permanent authority to command all the military and naval\r\nforces throughout the empire for the defence and tranquillization of\r\nthe country. In that light the shogunate was regarded while it\r\nremained in the hands of Yoritomo and his two sons, Yoriie and\r\nSanetomo. But with the death of Sanetomo, in 1219, and the political\r\nextinction of the Minamoto family, the shogunate assumed a different\r\ncharacter in the eyes of the Minamoto's successors, the Hojo. These\r\nlatter, not qualified to hold the office themselves, regarded it as a\r\nlink between Kamakura and Kyoto, and even as a source from which\r\nmight be derived lawful sanction for opposing the Throne should\r\noccasion arise. Therefore they asked the Emperor Go-Toba to nominate\r\none of his younger sons, and on receiving a refusal, they were fain\r\nto be content with a member of the Fujiwara family, who had long held\r\nthe Court in the hollow of their hands. This nomination was never\r\nintended to carry with it any real authority. The shoguns were mere\r\npuppets. During the interval of 114 years between the death of\r\nSanetomo (1219) and the fall of the Hojo (1333), there were six of\r\nthese fainéant officials:\r\n\r\n                                                  Age at   Age at\r\n                                                  Appn't   Depos'n\r\n\r\nFujiwara Yoritsune,                    1219-1244      2        27\r\n\r\nYoritsugu                              1244-1252      5        13\r\n\r\nPrince Munetaka,                       1252-1266     10        24\r\nelder brother of Go-Fukakusa\r\n\r\nPrince Koreyasu, son of Munetaka       1266-1289      3        26\r\n\r\nPrince Hisaakira, son of Go-Fukakusa   1289-1308     13        32\r\n\r\nPrince Morikuni, son of Hisaakira      1308-1333      7        32\r\n\r\nThe record shows that all these officials were appointed at an age\r\nwhen independent thought had not yet become possible, and that they\r\nwere removed as soon as they began to think for themselves. It will\r\nbe observed that there is a palpable break in the uniformity of the\r\nlist. Yoritsugu alone was stripped of office while still in his\r\nteens. That was because his father, the ex-shogun, engaged in a plot\r\nto overthrow the Hojo. But the incident was also opportune. It\r\noccurred just at the time when other circumstances combined to\r\npromote the ambition of the Hojo in the matter of obtaining an\r\nImperial prince for shogun. The throne was then occupied by\r\nGo-Fukakusa (the eighty-ninth sovereign), a son of Go-Saga (the\r\neighty-eighth sovereign), who, as we shall see, owed his elevation to\r\nthe influence exercised by Hojo Yasutoki after the Shokyu war. Now it\r\nhappened that, in 1252, a conspiracy against Go-Saga was found to\r\nhave been fomented by the head of that branch of the Fujiwara family\r\nfrom which the Kamakura shoguns were taken. The conspiracy was a\r\nthing of the past and so were its principal fomenters, but it served\r\nas a conclusive reason for not creating another Fujiwara shogun.\r\nPrince Munetaka, an elder brother of the reigning Emperor, was\r\nchosen, and thus the last four Bakufu shoguns were all of Imperial\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nTheir lineage, however, did not avail much as against Bakufu\r\narbitrariness. The Hojo adopted towards the shoguns the same\r\npolicy as that previously pursued by the Fujiwara towards the\r\nsovereigns--appointment during the years of childhood and removal\r\non reaching full manhood.* But the shoguns were not unavenged.\r\n\r\n*It is related that when the regent, Sadatoki, in 1289, removed\r\nPrince Koreyasu from the office of shogun, he ordered that the bamboo\r\npalanquin in which the prince journeyed to Kyoto should be carried\r\nwith the back in front. The people said that the prince was banished\r\nto Kyoto.\r\n\r\nIt was owing to the social influence exercised by their entourage\r\nthat the frugal and industrious habits of the bushi at Kamakura were\r\ngradually replaced by the effeminate pastimes and enervating\r\naccomplishments of the Imperial capital. For the personnel and\r\nequipage of a shogun's palace at Kamakura differed essentially from\r\nthose of Hojo regents (shikken) like Yasutoki and his three immediate\r\nsuccessors. In the former were seen a multitude of highly paid\r\nofficials whose duties did not extend to anything more serious than\r\nthe conservation of forms of etiquette; the custody of gates, doors,\r\nand shutters; the care of pavilions and villas; the practice and\r\nteaching of polite accomplishments, such as music and versification;\r\ndancing, handball, and football; the cultivation of refined archery\r\nand equestrianism, and the guarding of the shogun's person.*\r\n\r\n*The officials of the shogun's court were collectively called banshu.\r\n\r\nAt the regency, on the other hand, functions of the most arduous\r\ncharacter were continuously discharged by a small staff of earnest,\r\nunpretentious men, strangers to luxury or leisure and solicitous,\r\nprimarily, to promote the cause of justice and to satisfy the canons\r\nof efficiency. The contrast could not but be demoralizing. Not\r\nrapidly or without a struggle, but slowly and inevitably, the poison\r\nof bad example permeated Kamakura society, and the sinecures in the\r\nshogun's household came to be coveted by the veterans of the Bakufu,\r\nwho, throughout the peaceful times secured by Hojo rule, found no\r\nmeans of gaining honours or riches in the field, and who saw\r\nthemselves obliged to mortgage their estates in order to meet the\r\ncost of living, augmented by extravagant banquets, fine buildings,\r\nand rich garments. Eight times between 1252 and 1330, edicts were\r\nissued by the Bakufu fixing the prices of commodities, vetoing costly\r\nresidences, prohibiting expensive garments, censuring neglect of\r\nmilitary arts, and ordering resumption of the old-time sports and\r\nexercises. These attempts to check the evil had only very partial\r\nsuccess. The vices spread, and \"in the complex of factors that led to\r\nthe downfall of the Bakufu, the ultimate ascendancy of Kyoto's social\r\nstandards in Kamakura must probably be regarded as the most\r\nimportant.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO LINES OF EMPERORS\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to turn for a moment to the story of the Imperial\r\ncity, which, since the appearance of the Bakufu upon the scene, has\r\noccupied a very subordinate place in these pages, as it did in fact.\r\nNot that there was any outward or visible sign of diminishing\r\nimportance. All the old administrative machinery remained operative,\r\nthe old codes of etiquette continued to claim strict observance, and\r\nthe old functions of government were discharged. But only the shadow\r\nof authority existed at Kyoto; the substance had passed effectually\r\nto Kamakura. As for the throne, its chiefly remarkable feature was\r\nthe brevity of its occupation by successive sovereigns:\r\n\r\n   Order of Succession    Name         Date\r\n\r\n   77th Sovereign       Go-Shirakawa   1156-1158\r\n\r\n   78th    \"            Nijo           1159-1166\r\n\r\n   79th    \"            Rokuju         1166-1168\r\n\r\n   80th    \"            Takakura       1169-1180\r\n\r\n   81st    \"            Antoku         1181-1183\r\n\r\n   82nd    \"            Go-Toba        1184-1198\r\n\r\n   83rd    \"            Tsuchimikado   1199-1210\r\n\r\n   84th    \"            Juntoku        1211-1221\r\n\r\n   85th    \"            Chukyo         1221\r\n\r\n   86th    \"            Go-Horikawa    1221-1232\r\n\r\n   87th    \"            Shijo          1233-1242\r\n\r\n   88th    \"            Go-Saga        1243-1246\r\n\r\nHere are seen twelve consecutive Emperors whose united reigns covered\r\na period of ninety-one years, being an average of seven and one-half\r\nyears, approximately. It has been shown that Go-Horikawa received the\r\npurple practically from the hands of the Hojo in the sequel of the\r\nShokyu disturbance, and the same is true of Go-Saga, he having been\r\nnominated from Kamakura in preference to a son of Juntoku, whose\r\ncomplicity in that disturbance had been notorious. Hence Go-Saga's\r\nattitude towards Kamakura was always one of deference, increased by\r\nthe fact that his eldest son, Munetaka, went to Kamakura as shogun,\r\nin 1252. Vacating the throne in 1246, he named his second son,\r\nGo-Fukakusa, to succeed; and his third, Kameyama, to be Prince\r\nImperial. The former was only three years old when (1246) he became\r\nnominal sovereign, and, after a reign of thirteen years, he was\r\ncompelled (1259) to make way for his father's favourite, Kameyama,\r\nwho reigned from 1259 to 1274.\r\n\r\nTo understand what followed, a short genealogical table will assist:\r\n\r\n               88th Sovereign, Go-Saga (1243-1246)\r\n                                |\r\n                 +--------------+-------------+\r\n                 |                            |\r\n     89th, Go-Fukakusa (1246-1259)   90th, Kameyama (1259-1274)\r\n                 |                            |\r\n        92nd, Fushimi (1287-1298)     91st, Go-Uda (1274-1287)\r\n                 |                            |\r\n           +-----+----+                 +-----+-----+\r\n           |          |                 |           |\r\n         93rd,       95th,             94th,       96th,\r\n      Go-Fushimi   Hanazono           Go-Nijo    Go-Daigo\r\n      (1298-1301) (1307-1318)       (1301-1307) (1318-1339)\r\n           |          |                 |           |\r\n           +-----+----+                 +-----+-----+\r\n                 |                            |\r\n          Jimyo-in family             Daikagu-ji Family\r\n   (called afterwards Hoku-cho,   (called afterwards Nan-cho,\r\n      or the Northern Court)         or the Southern Court)\r\n\r\nThe cloistered Emperor, Go-Saga, abdicating after a reign of four\r\nyears, conducted the administration according to the camera system\r\nduring twenty-six years. It will be observed from the above table\r\nthat he essayed to hold the balance equally between the families of\r\nhis two sons, the occupant of the throne being chosen from each\r\nalternately. But everything goes to show that he favoured the\r\nKameyama branch. Like Go-Toba, he cherished the hope of seeing the\r\nImperial Court released from the Bakufu shackles, and to that end the\r\nalert, enterprising Kameyama seemed better suited than the dull,\r\nresourceless Takakura, just as in Go-Toba's eyes Juntoku had appeared\r\npreferable to Tsuchimikado.\r\n\r\nDying in 1272, Go-Saga left a will with injunctions that it should be\r\nopened in fifty days. It contained provisions destined to have\r\ndisastrous consequences. One clause entrusted to the Bakufu the duty\r\nof deciding whether the administrative power should be placed in the\r\nhands of the cloistered Emperor, Go-Fukakusa, or in those of the\r\nreigning sovereign, Kameyama. Another provided that a very large\r\nproperty, known as the Chokodo estates, should be inherited by the\r\nmonarch thus deposed from authority; while a comparatively small\r\nbequest went to the depository of power. In framing this curious\r\ninstrument, Go-Saga doubtless designed to gild the pill of permanent\r\nexclusion from the seats of power, believing confidently that the\r\nImperial succession would be secured to Kameyama and his direct\r\ndescendants. This anticipation proved correct. The Bakufu had\r\nrecourse to a Court lady to determine the trend of the deceased\r\nsovereign's wishes, and the result was that Kameyama triumphed.\r\n\r\nIn the normal order of things the cloistered Emperor Go-Fukakusa\r\nwould have succeeded to the administrative place occupied by Go-Saga,\r\nand a large body of courtiers, whose chances of promotion and\r\nemolument depended upon that arrangement, bitterly resented the\r\ninnovation. The palace became divided into two parties, the Naiho\r\n(interior section) and the Inho (camera section), a division which\r\ngrew more accentuated when Kameyama's son ascended the throne as\r\nGo-Uda, in 1274. Go-Fukakusa declared that he would leave his palace\r\nand enter a monastery were such a wrong done to his children.\r\nThereupon Kameyama--now cloistered Emperor--submitted the matter to\r\nthe Bakufu, who, after grave deliberation, decided that Go-Fukakusa's\r\nson should be named Crown Prince and should reign in succession to\r\nGo-Uda. This ruler is known in history as Fushimi.\r\n\r\nShortly after his accession a sensational event occurred. A bandit\r\nmade his way during the night into the palace and seizing one of the\r\ncourt ladies, ordered her to disclose the Emperor's whereabouts. The\r\nsagacious woman misdirected him, and then hastened to inform the\r\nsovereign, who disguised himself as a female and escaped. Arrested by\r\nthe guards, the bandit committed suicide with a sword which proved to\r\nbe a precious heirloom of the Sanjo family. Sanjo Sanemori, a former\r\ncouncillor of State, was arrested on suspicion, but his examination\r\ndisclosed nothing. Then a grand councillor (dainagori) charged the\r\ncloistered Emperor, Kameyama, with being privy to the attempt, and\r\nFushimi showed a disposition to credit the charge. Kameyama, however,\r\nconveyed to the Bakufu a solemn oath of innocence, with which Fushimi\r\nwas fain to be ostensibly content. But his Majesty remained\r\nunconvinced at heart. He sent to Kamakura a secret envoy with\r\ninstructions to attribute to Kameyama an abiding desire to avenge the\r\nwrongs of Go-Toba and wipe out the Shokyu humiliation. This vengeful\r\nmood might find practical expression at anytime, and Fushimi, warned\r\nthe Bakufu to be on their guard. \"As for me,\" he concluded, \"I leave\r\nmy descendants entirely in the hands of the Hojo. With Kamakura we\r\nstand or fall.\"\r\n\r\nHow much of this was sincere, how much diplomatic, it is not possible\r\nto determine. In Kamakura, however, it found credence. Sadatoki, then\r\nregent (shikken), took prompt measures to have Fushimi's son\r\nproclaimed Prince Imperial, and, in 1298, he was enthroned as\r\nGo-Fushimi. This evoked an indignant protest from the then cloistered\r\nEmperor, Go-Uda, and after some consideration the Kamakura regent,\r\nSadatoki, suggested--\"directed\" would perhaps be a more correct form\r\nof speech--that thenceforth the succession to the throne should\r\nalternate between the two families descended from Go-Fukakusa and\r\nKameyama, the length of a reign being limited to ten years.\r\nNominally, this arrangement was a mark of deference to the testament\r\nof Go-Saga, but in reality it was an astute device to weaken the\r\nauthority of the Court by dividing it into rival factions. Kamakura's\r\nfiat received peaceful acquiescence at first. Go-Uda's eldest son\r\ntook the sceptre in 1301, under the name of Go-Nijo, and, after seven\r\nyears, he was succeeded by Fushimi's son, Hanazono, who, in twelve\r\nyears, made way for Go-Uda's second son, Go-Daigo.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of Kameyama were called the \"Daigaku-ji family,\" and\r\nthe descendants of Go-Fukakusa received the name of the \"Jimyo-in\r\nfamily.\" When a member of the latter occupied the throne, the Court\r\nenjoyed opulence, owing to its possession of the extensive Chokodo\r\nestates; but when the sovereign was of the Daigaku-ji line\r\ncomparative penury was experienced. There can be little doubt that,\r\nthroughout the complications antecedent to this dual system, the\r\nFushimi princes acted practically as spies for the Bakufu. After all,\r\nthe two Imperial families were descended from a common ancestor and\r\nshould have shrunk from the disgrace of publishing their rivalries.\r\nIt is true, as we shall presently see, that the resulting\r\ncomplications involved the destruction of the Hojo; but it is also\r\ntrue that they plunged the nation into a fifty years' war.\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE REGENT FAMILIES\r\n\r\nIt has already been related how, by Yoritomo's contrivance, the post\r\nof family--descended from Fujiwara Kanezane--and scions of the Konoe\r\nfamily--descended from Fujiwara Motomichi. This system was\r\nsubsequently extended at the instance of the Hojo. The second and\r\nthird sons of Michiiye, grandson of Kanezane, founded the houses of\r\nNijo and Ichijo, respectively; while Kanehira, the second of two\r\ngrandsons of Motomichi, established the house of Takatsukasa. These\r\nfive families--Konoe, Kujo, Nijo, Ichijo, and Takatsukasa--were\r\ncollectively called Go-sekke (the Five Regent Houses) in recognition\r\nof the fact that the regent in Kyoto was supposed to be taken from\r\nthem in succession. The arrangement led to frequent strife with\r\nresulting weakness, thus excellently achieving the purpose of its\r\ncontrivers, the Hojo.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MONGOL INVASION\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Hojo synchronized with two events of prime importance\r\nthe invasion of Japan by a Mongolian army, first in 1274, and\r\nsubsequently in 1281. Early in the twelfth century, the Emperor of\r\nChina, which was then under the sway of the Sung dynasty, invited the\r\nGolden Tatars to deal with the Khitan Tatars, who held Manchuria, and\r\nwho, in spite of heavy tribute paid annually by the Sung Court,\r\ncontinually raided northeastern China. The Golden Tatars responded to\r\nthe invitation by not only expelling the Khitans but also taking\r\ntheir place in Manchuria and subsequently overrunning China, where\r\nthey established a dynasty of their own from 1115 to 1234.\r\n\r\nThese struggles and dynastic changes did not sensibly affect Japan.\r\nHer intercourse with the Asiatic continent in those ages was confined\r\nmainly to an interchange of visits by Buddhist priests, to industrial\r\nenterprise, and to a fitful exchange of commodities. It does not\r\nappear that any branch of the Tatars concerned themselves practically\r\nabout Japan or the Japanese. Ultimately, however, in the first part\r\nof the thirteenth century, the Mongols began to sweep down on the\r\nMiddle Kingdom under the leadership of Jenghiz Khan. They crushed the\r\nGolden Tatars, transferred (1264) the Mongol capital from central\r\nAsia to Peking (Cambaluc), and, in 1279, under Kublai, completely\r\nconquered China. Nearly thirty years before the transfer of the\r\ncapital to Peking, the Mongols invaded the Korean peninsula, and\r\nbrought it completely under their sway in 1263, receiving the final\r\nsubmission of the kingdom of Koma, which alone had offered any\r\nstubborn resistance.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Kublai's ambition, whetted by extensive\r\nconquests, would have turned in the direction of Japan sooner or\r\nlater, but tradition indicates that the idea of obtaining the homage\r\nof the Island Empire was suggested to the great Khan by a Korean\r\ntraveller in 1265. Kublai immediately acted on the suggestion. He\r\nsent an embassy by way of Korea, ordering the Koma sovereign to make\r\narrangements for the transport of the envoys and to re-enforce them\r\nwith a Korean colleague. A tempest interrupted this essay, and it was\r\nnot repeated until 1268, when the Khan's messengers, accompanied by a\r\nKorean suite, crossed safely to Chikuzen and delivered to the\r\nDazai-fu a letter from Kublai with a covering despatch from the\r\nKorean King. The Korean sovereign's despatch was plainly inspired by\r\na desire to avert responsibility from himself. He explained that in\r\ntransporting the embassy he acted unavoidably, but that, in sending\r\nit, the Khan was not actuated by any hostile feeling, his sole\r\npurpose being to include Japan in the circle of his friendly\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Koma prince--he no longer could properly be called a\r\nmonarch--would have been only too pleased to see Japan pass under the\r\nMongol yoke as his own kingdom had already done. Kublai's letter,\r\nhowever, though not deliberately arrogant, could not be construed in\r\nany sense except as a summons to send tribute-bearing envoys to\r\nPeking. He called himself \"Emperor\" and addressed the Japanese ruler\r\nas \"King;\" instanced, for fitting example, the relation between China\r\nand Korea, which he described at once as that of lord and vassal and\r\nthat of parent and child, and predicated that refusal of intercourse\r\nwould \"lead to war.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese interpreted this to be an offer of suzerainty or\r\nsubjugation. Two courses were advocated; one by Kyoto, the other by\r\nKamakura. The former favoured a policy of conciliation and delay; the\r\nlatter, an attitude of contemptuous silence. Kamakura, of course,\r\ntriumphed. After six months' retention the envoys were sent away\r\nwithout so much as a written acknowledgment. The records contain\r\nnothing to show whether this bold course on the part of the Bakufu\r\nhad its origin in ignorance of the Mongol's might or in a conviction\r\nof the bushi's fighting superiority. Probably both factors were\r\noperative; for Japan's knowledge of Jenghiz and his resources reached\r\nher chiefly through religious channels, and the fact that Koreans\r\nwere associated with Mongols in the mission must have tended to lower\r\nthe affair in her estimation. Further, the Japanese had been taught\r\nby experience the immense difficulties of conducting oversea\r\ncampaigns, and if they understood anything about the Mongols, it\r\nshould have been the essentially non-maritime character of the\r\nmid-Asian conquerors.\r\n\r\nBy Kublai himself that defect was well appreciated. He saw that to\r\ncarry a body of troops to Japan, the seagoing resources of the\r\nKoreans must be requisitioned, and on the bootless return of his\r\nfirst embassy, he immediately issued orders to the Koma King to build\r\none thousand ships and mobilize forty thousand troops. In vain the\r\nrecipient of these orders pleaded inability to execute them. The Khan\r\ninsisted, and supplemented his first command with instructions that\r\nagricultural operations should be undertaken on a large scale in the\r\npeninsula to supply food for the projected army of invasion.\r\nMeanwhile he despatched embassy after embassy to Japan, evidently\r\nbeing desirous of carrying his point by persuasion rather than by\r\nforce. The envoys invariably returned re infecta. On one occasion\r\n(1269), a Korean vessel carried off two Japanese from Tsushima and\r\nsent them to Peking. There, Kublai treated them kindly, showed them\r\nhis palace as well as a parade of his troops, and sent them home to\r\ntell what they had seen. But the Japanese remained obdurate, and\r\nfinally the Khan sent an ultimatum, to which Tokimune, the Hojo\r\nregent, replied by dismissing the envoys forthwith.\r\n\r\nWar was now inevitable. Kublai massed 25,000 Mongol braves in Korea,\r\nsupplemented them with 15,000 Korean troops, and embarking them in a\r\nflotilla of 900 vessels manned by 8000 Koreans, launched this paltry\r\narmy against Japan in November, 1274. The armada began by attacking\r\nTsushima and Iki, islands lying in the strait that separates the\r\nKorean peninsula from Japan. In Tsushima, the governor, So Sukekuni,*\r\ncould not muster more than two hundred bushi. But these two hundred\r\nfought to the death, as did also the still smaller garrison of Iki.\r\nBefore the passage of the narrow strait was achieved, the invaders\r\nmust have lost something of their faith in the whole enterprise. On\r\nNovember 20th, they landed at Hako-zaki Gulf in the province of\r\nChikuzen There they were immediately assailed by the troops of five\r\nKyushu chieftains. What force the latter represented there is no\r\nrecord, but they were certainly less numerous than the enemy.\r\nMoreover, the Yuan army possessed a greatly superior tactical system.\r\nBy a Japanese bushi the battle-field was regarded as an arena for the\r\ndisplay of individual prowess, not of combined force. The Mongols, on\r\nthe contrary, fought in solid co-operation, their movements directed\r\nby sound of drum from some eminence where the commander-in-chief\r\nwatched the progress of the fight. If a Japanese approached to defy\r\none of them to single combat, they enveloped and slew him. Further,\r\nat close quarters they used light arms dipped in poison, and for\r\nlong-range purposes they had powerful crossbows, which quite\r\noutclassed the Japanese weapons. They were equipped also with\r\nexplosives which they fired from metal tubes, inflicting heavy loss\r\non the Japanese, who were demoralized by such an unwonted weapon.\r\nFinally, they were incomparable horsemen, and in the early encounters\r\nthey put the Japanese cavalry out of action by raising with drums and\r\ngongs a din that terrified the latter's horses. But, in spite of all\r\nthese disadvantages, the Japanese fought stubbornly. Whenever they\r\ngot within striking distance of the foe, they struck desperately, and\r\ntowards evening they were able to retire in good order into cover\r\n\"behind the primitive fortifications of Mizuki raised for Tenchi\r\nTenno by Korean engineers six centuries before.\"\r\n\r\n*Grandson of Taira no Tomomori, admiral of the Hei fleet in the\r\nbattle of Dan-no-ura.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: REPULSE OF THE MONGOL INVADERS (From a scroll painting in\r\npossession of the Imperial Household)\r\n\r\nThat night the west coast of Kyushu was menaced by one of those\r\nfierce gales that rage from time to time in sub-tropical zones. The\r\nKorean pilots knew that their ships could find safety in the open sea\r\nonly. But what was to be done with the troops which had debarked? Had\r\ntheir commanders seen any certain hope of victory, they would not\r\nhave hesitated to part temporarily from the ships. The day's\r\nfighting, however, appears to have inspired a new estimate of the\r\nbushi's combatant qualities. It was decided to embark the Yuan forces\r\nand start out to sea. For the purpose of covering this movement, the\r\nHakozaki shrine and some adjacent hamlets were fired, and when\r\nmorning dawned the invaders' flotilla was seen beating out of the\r\nbay. One of their vessels ran aground on Shiga spit at the north of\r\nthe haven and several others foundered at sea, so that when a tally\r\nwas finally called, 13,200 men did not answer to their names. As to\r\nwhat the Japanese casualties were, there is no information.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND MONGOL INVASION\r\n\r\nOf course Kublai did not acknowledge this as a defeat at the hands of\r\nthe Japanese. On the contrary, he seems to have imagined that the\r\nfight had struck terror into the hearts of the islanders by\r\ndisclosing their faulty tactics and inferior weapons. He therefore\r\nsent another embassy, which was charged to summon the King of Japan\r\nto Peking, there to do obeisance to the Yuan Emperor. Kamakura's\r\nanswer was to decapitate the five leaders of the mission and to\r\npillory their heads outside the city. Nothing, indeed, is more\r\nremarkable than the calm confidence shown at this crisis by the\r\nBakufu regent, Tokimune. His country's annalists ascribe that mood to\r\nfaith in the doctrines of the Zen sect of Buddhism; faith which he\r\nshared with his father, Tokiyori, during the latter's life. The Zen\r\npriests taught an introspective philosophy. They preached that life\r\nsprings from not-living, indestructibility from destruction, and that\r\nexistence and non-existence are one in reality. No creed could better\r\ninspire a soldier.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that Tokimune was not guided in this matter\r\nsolely by religious instincts: he used the Zen-shu bonzes as a\r\nchannel for obtaining information about China. Some plausibility is\r\ngiven to that theory by the fact that he sat, first, at the feet of\r\nDoryu, originally a Chinese priest named Tao Lung, and that on\r\nDoryu's death he invited (1278) from China a famous bonze, Chu Yuan\r\n(Japanese, Sogen), for whose ministrations the afterwards celebrated\r\ntemple Yengaku-ji was erected. Sogen himself, when officiating at the\r\ntemple of Nengjen, in Wenchow, had barely escaped massacre at the\r\nhands of the Mongols, and he may not have been averse to acting as a\r\nmedium of information between China and Kamakura.\r\n\r\nTokimune's religious fervour, however, did not interfere with his\r\nsecular preparations. In 1280, he issued an injunction exhorting\r\nlocal officials and vassals (go-kenin) to compose all their\r\ndissensions and work in unison. There could be no greater crime, the\r\ndocument declared, then to sacrifice the country's interests on the\r\naltar of personal enmities at a time of national crisis. Loyal\r\nobedience on the part of vassals, and strict impartiality on the side\r\nof high constables--these were the virtues which the safety of the\r\nState demanded, and any neglect to practise them should be punished\r\nwith the utmost severity. This injunction was issued in 1280, and\r\nalready steps had been taken to construct defensive works at all\r\nplaces where the Mongols might effect a landing--at Hakozaki Bay in\r\nKyushu; at Nagato, on the northern side of the Shimonoseki Strait; at\r\nHarima, on the southern shore of the Inland Sea; and at Tsuruga, on\r\nthe northwest of the main island. Among these places, Hakozaki and\r\nNagato were judged to be the most menaced, and special offices, after\r\nthe nature of the Kyoto tandai, were established there.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HOJO TOKIMUNE\r\n\r\nSeven years separated the first invasion from the second. It was not\r\nof deliberate choice that Kublai allowed so long an interval to\r\nelapse. The subjugation of the last supporters of the Sung dynasty in\r\nsouthern China had engrossed his attention, and with their fall he\r\nacquired new competence to prosecute this expedition to Japan,\r\nbecause while the Mongolian boats were fit only for plying on inland\r\nwaters, the ships of the southern Chinese were large, ocean-going\r\ncraft. It was arranged that an army of 100,000 Chinese and Mongols\r\nshould embark at a port in Fuhkien opposite the island of Formosa,\r\nand should ultimately form a junction in Tsushima Strait with an\r\narmada of 1000 Korean ships, carrying, in addition to their crews, a\r\nforce of 50,000 Mongols and 20,000 Koreans.\r\n\r\nBut before launching this formidable host, Kublai made a final effort\r\nto compass his end without fighting. In 1280, he sent another embassy\r\nto Japan, announcing the complete overthrow of the Sung dynasty, and\r\nsummoning the Island Empire to enter into friendly relations.\r\nKamakura's answer was to order the execution of the envoys at the\r\nplace where they had landed, Hakata in Chikuzen. Nothing now remained\r\nexcept an appeal to force. A weak point in the Yuan strategy was that\r\nthe two armadas were not operated in unison. The Korean fleet sailed\r\nnearly a month before that from China. It would seem that the\r\ntardiness of the latter was not due wholly to its larger dimensions,\r\nbut must be attributed in part to its composition. A great portion of\r\nthe troops transported from China were not Mongols, but Chinese, who\r\nhad been recently fighting against the Yuan, and whose despatch on a\r\nforeign campaign in the service of their victors suggested itself as\r\na politic measure. These men were probably not averse to delay and\r\ncertainly cannot have been very enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1281, the flotilla from Korea appeared off Tsushima.\r\nUnfortunately, the annals of medieval Japan are singularly reticent\r\nas to the details of battles. There are no materials for constructing\r\na story of the events that occurred on the Tsushima shores, more than\r\nsix centuries ago. We do not even know what force the defenders of\r\nthe island mustered. But that they were much more numerous than on\r\nthe previous occasion, seven years before, is certain. Already, in\r\n1280, Tokimune had obtained from Buddhist sources information of the\r\nMongol preparations--preparations so extensive that the felling of\r\ntimber to make ships inspired a Chinese poem in which the green hills\r\nwere depicted as mourning for their trees--and he would not have\r\nfailed to garrison strongly a position so cardinal as the midchannel\r\nisland of Tsushima. It was not reduced. The enemy were able to effect\r\na lodgement, but could not overrun the island or put its defenders to\r\nthe sword, as had been done in 1274. The Korean ships remained at\r\nTsushima awaiting the arrival of the Chinese flotilla. They lost\r\nthree thousand men from sickness during this interval, and were\r\ntalking of retreat when the van of the southern armada hove in sight.\r\nA junction was effected off the coast of Iki island, and the garrison\r\nof this little place having been destroyed on June 10th, the combined\r\nforces stood over towards Kyushu and landed at various places along\r\nthe coast of Chikuzen, making Hakozaki Bay their base.\r\n\r\nSuch a choice of locality was bad, for it was precisely along the\r\nshores of this bay that the Japanese had erected fortifications. They\r\nwere not very formidable fortifications, it is true. The bushi of\r\nthese days knew nothing about bastions, curtains, glacis, or cognate\r\nrefinements of military engineering. They simply built a stone wall\r\nto block the foe's advance, and did not even adopt the precaution of\r\nprotecting their flanks. But neither did they fall into the error of\r\nacting entirely on the defensive. On the contrary, they attacked\r\nalike on shore and at sea. Their boats were much smaller than those\r\nof the invaders, but the advantage in dash and daring was all on the\r\nside of the Japanese. So furious were their onsets, and so deadly was\r\nthe execution they wrought with their trenchant swords at close\r\nquarters, that the enemy were fain to lash their ships together and\r\nlay planks between them for purposes of speedy concentration. It is\r\nmost improbable that either the Korean or the Chinese elements of the\r\ninvading army had any heart for the work, whereas on the side of the\r\ndefenders there are records of whole families volunteering to serve\r\nat the front. During fifty-three days the campaign continued; that is\r\nto say, from June 23rd, when the first landing was effected, until\r\nAugust 14th, when a tornado swept off the face of the sea the main\r\npart of the Yuan armada.\r\n\r\nNo account has been preserved, either traditionally or historically,\r\nof the incidents or phases of the long fight. We know that the\r\ninvaders occupied the island of Hirado and landed in Hizen a strong\r\nforce intended to turn the flank of the Hakozaki Bay parapet. We\r\nknow, inferentially, that they never succeeded in turning it. We know\r\nthat, after nearly two months of incessant combat, the Yuan armies\r\nhad made no sensible impression on the Japanese resistance or\r\nestablished any footing upon Japanese soil. We know that, on August\r\nthe 14th and 15th, there burst on the shores of Kyushu a tempest\r\nwhich shattered nearly the whole of the Chinese flotilla. And we know\r\nthat the brunt of the loss fell on the Chinese contingent, some\r\ntwelve thousand of whom were made slaves. But no such momentous\r\nchapter of history has ever been traced in rougher outlines. The\r\nannalist is compelled to confine himself to marshalling general\r\nresults. It was certainly a stupendous disaster for the Yuan arms.\r\nYet Kublai was not content; he would have essayed the task again had\r\nnot trouble nearer home diverted his attention from Japan. The Island\r\nEmpire had thus the honour of being practically the only state in the\r\nOrient that did not present tribute to the all-conquering Mongols.\r\n\r\nBut, by a strangely wayward fate, these victories over a foreign\r\ninvader brought embarrassment to the Hojo rulers rather than renown.\r\nIn the first place, there could not be any relaxation of the\r\nextraordinary preparations which such incidents dictated. Kublai's\r\nsuccessor, Timur, lost no time in countermanding all measures for a\r\nrenewed attack on Japan, and even adopted the plan of commissioning\r\nBuddhist priests to persuade the Bakufu of China's pacific\r\nintentions. One of these emissaries, Nei-issan (Chinese\r\npronunciation, Ning I-shan), settled permanently in Japan, and his\r\nholy ministrations as a Zen-shu propagandist won universal respect.\r\nBut the Bakufu did not relax their precautions, and for more than a\r\nscore of years a heavy burden of expense had to be borne on this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nFurther, when the wave of invasion broke on the shores of Kyushu, the\r\nCourt in Kyoto set the example of appealing to the assistance of\r\nheaven. Prayers were offered, liturgies were chanted, and incense was\r\nburned at many temples and shrines throughout the empire. Several of\r\nthe priests did not hesitate to assert that their supplications had\r\nelicited signs and portents indicating supernatural aid. Rich rewards\r\nwere bestowed in recognition of these services, whereas, on the\r\ncontrary, the recompense given to the soldiers who had fought so\r\ngallantly and doggedly to beat off a foreign foe was comparatively\r\npetty. Means of recompensing them were scant. When Yoritomo overthrew\r\nthe Taira, the estates of the latter were divided among his followers\r\nand co-operators. After the Shokyu disturbance, the property of the\r\nCourt nobles served a similar purpose. But the repulse of the Mongols\r\nbrought no access of wealth to the victors, and for the first time\r\nmilitary merit had to go unrequited while substantial grants were\r\nmade to the servants of religion. The Bakufu, fully conscious of this\r\ndangerous discrepancy, saw no resource except to order that strict\r\nsurveys should be made of many of the great estates, with a view to\r\ntheir delimitation and reduction, if possible. This, however, was a\r\nslow progress, and the umbrage that it caused was more than\r\ncommensurate with the results that accrued. Thus, to the Bakufu the\r\nconsequences of a war which should have strengthened allegiance and\r\ngratitude were, on the contrary, injurious and weakening.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FIVE STRING BIWA (JAPANESE MANDOLIN)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KOTO, 13-STRINGED HORIZONTAL HARP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nART, RELIGION, LITERATURE, CUSTOMS, AND COMMERCE IN THE KAMAKURA\r\nPERIOD\r\n\r\nART\r\n\r\nFrom the establishment of the Bakufu, Japanese art separated into two\r\nschools, that of Kamakura and that of Kyoto. The latter centered in\r\nthe Imperial Court, the former in the Court of the Hojo. Taken\r\noriginally from Chinese masters of the Sui and Tang dynasties, the\r\nKyoto art ultimately developed into the Japanese national school,\r\nwhereas the Kamakura art, borrowed from the academies of Sung and\r\nYuan, became the favourite of the literary classes and preserved its\r\nChinese traditions. Speaking broadly, the art of Kyoto showed a\r\ndecorative tendency, whereas that of Kamakura took landscape and\r\nseascape chiefly for motives, and, delighting in the melancholy\r\naspects of nature, appealed most to the student and the cenobite.\r\nThis distinction could be traced in calligraphy, painting,\r\narchitecture, and horticulture. Hitherto penmanship in Kyoto had\r\ntaken for models the style of Kobo Daishi and Ono no Tofu. This was\r\ncalled o-ie-fu (domestic fashion), and had a graceful and cursive\r\ncharacter. But the Kamakura calligraphists followed the pure Chinese\r\nmode (karayo), as exemplified by the Buddhist priests, Sogen (Chu\r\nYuan) and Ichinei (I Ning).\r\n\r\nIn Kyoto, painting was represented by the schools of Koze, Kasuga,\r\nSumiyoshi, and Tosa; in Kamakura, its masters were Ma Yuan, Hsia\r\nKwei, and Mu Hsi, who represented the pure Southern Academy of China,\r\nand who were followed by Sesshu, Kao, and Shubun. So, too, the art of\r\nhorticulture, though there the change was a transition from the stiff\r\nand comparatively artificial fashion of the no-niwa (moor garden) to\r\nthe pure landscape park, ultimately developed into a Japanese\r\nspecialty. Tradition ascribes to a Chinese bonze, who called himself\r\nNei-issan (or Ichinei), the planning of the first landscape garden,\r\nproperly so designated in Japan. He arrived in Kyushu, under the name\r\nof I Ning, as a delegate from Kublai Khan in the days of Hojo\r\nSadatoki, and was banished, at first, to the province of Izu.\r\nSubsequently, however, the Bakufu invited him to Kamakura and\r\nassigned the temple Kencho-ji for his residence and place of\r\nministrations. It was there that he designed the first landscape\r\ngarden, furnishing suggestions which are still regarded as models.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe conservatism of the Imperial city is conspicuously illustrated in\r\nthe realm of literature. Careful perusal of the well-known work,\r\nMasukagami, shows that from year's end to year's end the same\r\npastimes were enjoyed, the same studies pursued The composition of\r\npoetry took precedence of everything. Eminent among the poetasters of\r\nthe twelfth century was the Emperor Go-Toba. The littérateurs of his\r\nera looked up to him as the arbiter elegantiarum, especially in the\r\ndomain of Japanese versification. Even more renown attached to\r\nFujiwara no Toshinari, whose nom de plume was Shunzei, and who earned\r\nthe title of the \"Matchless Master.\" His son, Sadaiye, was well-nigh\r\nequally famous under the name of Teika.\r\n\r\nAfter the Shokyu disturbance (1221), the empire enjoyed a long spell\r\nof peace under the able and upright sway of the Hojo, and during that\r\ntime it became the custom to compile anthologies. The first to essay\r\nthat task was Teika. Grieving that the poets of his time had begun to\r\nprefer affectation and elegance to sincerity and simplicity, he\r\nwithdrew to a secluded villa on Mount Ogura, and there selected, a\r\nhundred poems by as many of the ancient authors. These he gave to the\r\nworld, calling the collection Hyakunin-isshu, and succeeding\r\ngenerations endorsed his choice so that the book remains a classic to\r\nthis day. Teika's son, Tameiye, won such favour in the eyes of the\r\nKamakura shogun, Sanetomo, that the latter conferred on him the manor\r\nof Hosokawa, in Harima. Dying, Tameiye bequeathed this property to\r\nhis son, Tamesuke, but he, being robbed of it by his step-brother,\r\nfell into a state of miserable poverty which was shared by his\r\nmother, herself well known as an authoress under the name of\r\nAbutsu-ni. This intrepid lady, leaving her five sons in Kyoto,\r\nrepaired to Kamakura to bring suit against the usurper, and the\r\njournal she kept en route--the Izayoi-nikki--is still regarded as a\r\nmodel of style and sentiment. It bears witness to the fact that\r\nstudents of poetry in that era fell into two classes: one adhering to\r\nthe pure Japanese style of the Heian epoch; the others borrowing\r\nfreely from Chinese literature.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at Kamakura, the Bakufu regents, Yasutoki, Tokiyori and\r\nTokimune, earnest disciples of Buddhism, were building temples and\r\nassigning them to Chinese priests of the Sung and Yuan eras who\r\nreached Japan as official envoys or as frank propagandists. Five\r\ngreat temples thus came into existence in the Bakufu capital, and as\r\nthe Chinese bonzes planned and superintended their construction,\r\nthese buildings and their surroundings reflected the art-canons at\r\nonce of China, of Japan, and of the priests themselves. The same\r\nforeign influence made itself felt in the region of literature. But\r\nwe should probably be wrong in assuming that either religion or art\r\nor literature for their own sakes constituted the sole motive of the\r\nHojo regents in thus acting. It has already been shown that they\r\nwelcomed the foreign priests as channels for obtaining information\r\nabout the neighbouring empire's politics, and there is reason to\r\nthink that their astute programme included a desire to endow Kamakura\r\nwith an artistic and literary atmosphere of its own, wholly\r\nindependent of Kyoto and purged of the enervating elements that\r\npermeated the latter.\r\n\r\nThis separation of the civilizations of the east (Kwanto) and the\r\nwest (Kyoto) resulted ultimately in producing asceticism and\r\nreligious reform. The former, because men of really noble instincts\r\nwere insensible to the ambition which alone absorbed a Kyoto\r\nlittérateur--the ambition of figuring prominently in an approved\r\nanthology--and had, at the same time, no inclination to follow the\r\npurely military creed of Kamakura. Such recluses as Kamo Chomei,\r\nSaigyo Hoshi and Yoshida Kenko were an outcome of these conditions.\r\nChomei has been called the \"Wordsworth of Japan.\" He is immortalized\r\nby a little book of thirty pages, called Hojoki (Annals of a Cell.)\r\nIt is a volume of reflections suggested by life in a hut measuring\r\nten feet square and seven feet high, built in a valley remote from\r\nthe stir of life. The style is pellucid and absolutely unaffected;\r\nthe ideas are instinct with humanity and love of nature. Such a work,\r\nso widely admired, reveals an author and an audience instinct with\r\ngraceful thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn the career of Saigyo--\"the reverend,\" as his title \"hoshi\"\r\nsignifies--there were episodes vividly illustrating the manners and\r\ncustoms of the tune. Originally an officer of the guards in Kyoto, he\r\nattained considerable skill in military science and archery, but his\r\npoetic heart rebelling against such pursuits, he resigned office,\r\ntook the tonsure, and turning his back upon his wife and children,\r\nbecame a wandering bard. Yoritomo encountered him one day, and was so\r\nstruck by his venerable appearance that he invited him to his mansion\r\nand would have had him remain there permanently. But Saigyo declined.\r\nOn parting, the Minamoto chief gave him as souvenir a cat chiselled\r\nin silver, which the old ascetic held in such light esteem that he\r\nbestowed it on the first child he met. Yoshida Kenko, who became a\r\nrecluse in 1324, is counted among the \"four kings\" of Japanese\r\npoetry--Ton-a, Joben, Keiun, and Kenko. He has been called the\r\n\"Horace of Japan.\" In his celebrated prose work, Weeds of Tedium\r\n(Tsure-zure-gusa), he seems to reveal a lurking love for the vices he\r\nsatirizes. These three authors were all pessimistic. They reflected\r\nthe tendency of the time.\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\nThe earliest Buddhist sect established in Japan was the Hosso. It\r\ncrossed from China in A.D. 653, and its principal place of worship\r\nwas the temple Kofuku-ji at Nara. Then (736) followed the Kegon sect,\r\nhaving its headquarters in the Todai-ji, where stands the colossal\r\nDaibutsu of Nara, Next in order was the Tendai, introduced from China\r\nby Dengyo in 805, and established at Hiei-zan in the temple\r\nEnryaku-ji; while fourth and last in the early group of important\r\nsects came the Shingon, brought from China in 809 by Kukai, and\r\nhaving its principal metropolitan place of worship at Gokoku-ji (or\r\nTo-ji) in Kyoto, and its principal provincial at Kongobo-ji on\r\nKoya-san. These four sects and some smaller ones were all introduced\r\nduring a period of 156 years. Thereafter, for a space of 387 years,\r\nthere was no addition to the number: things remained stationary until\r\n1196, when Honen began to preach the doctrines of the Jodo sect, and\r\nin the space of fifty-six years, between 1196 and 1252, three other\r\nsects were established, namely, the Zen, the Shin, and the Nichiren.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO GROUPS OF SECTS\r\n\r\nIn what did the teachings of the early groups of sects differ from\r\nthose of the later groups, and why did such a long interval separate\r\nthe two? Evidently the answers to these questions must have an\r\nimportant bearing on Japanese moral culture. From the time of its\r\nfirst introduction (A.D. 522) into Japan until the days of Shotoku\r\nTaishi (572-621), Japanese Buddhism followed the lines indicated in\r\nthe land of its provenance, Korea. Prince Shotoku was the first to\r\nappreciate China as the true source of religious learning, and by him\r\npriests were sent across the sea to study. But the first sect of any\r\nimportance--the Hosso--that resulted from this movement does not seem\r\nto have risen above the level of idolatry and polytheism. It was a\r\n\"system built up on the worship of certain perfected human beings\r\nconverted into personal gods; it affirmed the eternal permanence of\r\nsuch beings in some state or other, and it gave them divine\r\nattributes.\"* Some of these were companions and disciples of Shaka\r\n(Sakiya Muni); others, pure creations of fancy, or borrowed from the\r\nmythological systems of India. It is unnecessary here to enter into\r\nany enumeration of these deities further than to say that, as helpers\r\nof persons in trouble, as patrons of little children, as healers of\r\nthe sick, and as dispensers of mercy, they acted an important part in\r\nthe life of the people. But they did little or nothing to improve\r\nmen's moral and spiritual condition, and the same is true of a\r\nmultitude of arhats, devas, and other supernatural beings that go to\r\nmake up a numerous pantheon.\r\n\r\n*Lloyd's Developments of Japanese Buddhism, \"Transactions of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Japan,\" Vol. XXII; and Shinran and His Work, by\r\nthe same author.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of the eighth century that Japanese Buddhism\r\nrose to a higher level, and the agent of its elevation was Dengyo\r\nDaishi, whom the Emperor Kwammu sent to China to study the later\r\ndevelopments of the Indian faith. Dengyo and his companions in 802\r\nfound their way to the monastery of Tientai (Japanese, Tendai), and\r\nacquired there a perception of the true road to Saving Knowledge, a\r\nmiddle route \"which includes all and rejects none, and in which alone\r\nthe soul can be satisfied.\" Meditation and wisdom were declared to be\r\nthe stepping-stones to this route, and to reach them various rules\r\nhad to be followed, namely, \"the accomplishment of external\r\nmeans\"--such as observing the precepts, regulating raiment and food,\r\nfreedom from all worldly concerns and influences, promotion of all\r\nvirtuous desires, and so forth; \"chiding of evil desires\"--such as\r\nthe lust after beauty, the lust of sound, of perfumes, of taste, and\r\nof touch; \"casting away hindrances;\" \"harmonizing the faculties,\" and\r\n\"meditating upon absolute truth.\"\r\n\r\nNow first we meet with the Buddhas of Contemplation, and with a creed\r\nwhich seems to embody a Father, a Son, and a Holy Spirit. Such, in\r\nbriefest outline, was the doctrine taught at the close of the sixth\r\ncentury by a Chinese bonze at the monastery of Tientai, and carried\r\nthence to Japan two hundred years later by Dengyo, who established\r\nthe Tendai sect on Mount Hiei near Kyoto. Dengyo did not borrow\r\nblindly; he adapted, and thus the Tendai creed, as taught at\r\nHiei-zan, became in reality \"a system of Japanese education, fitting\r\nthe disciplinary and meditative methods of the Chinese propagandist\r\non the pre-existing foundations of earlier sects.\"\r\n\r\n\"The comprehensiveness of the Tendai system caused it to be the\r\nparent of many schisms. Out of it came all the large sects, with the\r\nexception of the Shingon,\" to be presently spoken of. \"On the other\r\nhand, this comprehensiveness ensured the success of the Tendai sect.\r\nWith the conception of the Buddhas of Contemplation came the idea\r\nthat these personages had frequently been incarnated for the welfare\r\nof mankind; that the ancient gods whom the Japanese worshipped were\r\nbut manifestations of these same mystical beings, and that the\r\nBuddhist faith had come, not to destroy the native Shinto, but to\r\nembody it into a higher and more universal system.\"*\r\n\r\n*\"The Buddhists recognized that the Shinto gods were incarnations of\r\nsome of the many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas brought from India and\r\nChina, and then the two faiths amalgamated and for centuries\r\ncomfortably shared the same places of worship.\"--Every-Day Japan, by\r\nLloyd.\r\n\r\nTHE SHINGON SECT\r\n\r\nIt was not to Dengyo, however, that Japan owed her most mysterious\r\nform of Buddhism, but to his contemporary, Kukai, remembered by\r\nposterity as Kobo Daishi. The traditions that have been handed down\r\nwith reference to this great teacher's life and personality reveal\r\none of those saints whose preaching and ministration have bestowed a\r\nperpetual blessing on humanity. Here, it must suffice to say that he\r\nfound no peace of mind until a visit to China brought comprehension\r\nof a Sutra which he had vainly studied in Japan. On his return, in\r\n806, he appeared before the emperor and many bonzes, and astonished\r\nall by his eloquence and his knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere are three \"vehicles\" in Buddhism, but only two of them need be\r\nmentioned here--the Hina-yana, or Small Vehicle, and the Maha-yana,\r\nor Great Vehicle. The term \"vehicle\" signifies a body of doctrine on\r\nwhich \"a believer may ride to the perfect consummation of his\r\nhumanity.\" The difference between these two requires many words to\r\nexplain fully, whereas only a few can be devoted to the purpose here.\r\n\"The Hina-yana Sutra is intended for beginners; the Maha-yana for\r\nthose more advanced in the path of the law.\" The teaching in the\r\nformer is negative; in the latter, positive. In the Hina-yana the\r\nperfect path is to abstain from four things--women, palaces,\r\nbeautiful objects, and riches. In the Maha-yana perfect virtue is the\r\npresence of four things--the spirit of wisdom, the love of virtue,\r\npatience and firmness, and the retired life. By the \"spirit of\r\nwisdom\" is meant the constant desire for the truth; by the \"love\r\nof virtue\" is signified the abhorrence of evil; by \"patience and\r\nfirmness\" are indicated perfect manliness as exhibited towards\r\nthe weak; by \"the retired life\" is designated humility and\r\nself-effacement.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing in the world like the Chinese scriptures of the\r\nMaha-yana. The canon in China is seven hundred times the amount of\r\nthe New Testament,\" and, of course, this vast extent means that there\r\nis a correspondingly wide field for eclecticism. \"The Hina-yana did\r\nnot trouble itself with metaphysical speculation; that was reserved\r\nfor the Maha-yana, and Kukai was the greatest Japanese teacher of the\r\narcana of Buddhism. How much of his system he owed to studies\r\nconducted in China, how much to his own inspiration, research has not\r\nyet determined. An essentially esoteric system, it conceived a world\r\nof ideas,\" grouped logically and systematically according to genera\r\nand species, forming a planetary cosmos, the members of which, with\r\ntheir satellites, revolved not only on their own axes but also round\r\na central sun.\r\n\r\nThis was the \"world of golden effulgence\"--a world permeated by the\r\nlight of truth. The sect was called the Shingon (True Word); and the\r\ncentral body was Dainichi (Great Sun), the Spirit of Truth, anterior\r\nto Shaka and greater than him. \"To reach the realization of the Truth\r\nthat Dainichi is omnipresent and that everything exists only in him,\r\na disciple must ascend by a double ladder, each half of which has ten\r\nsteps, namely, the intellectual ladder and the moral ladder.\" These\r\nladders constitute, in fact, a series of precepts, warnings, and\r\nexhortations; some easily comprehensible, others demanding profound\r\nthought, and the whole calculated to educate an absorbing aspiration\r\nfor the \"transcendental virtues,\" to possess which is to attain to\r\nperfect Buddhahood. Unquestionably the offspring of a great mind,\r\nthis Shingon system, with its mysterious possibilities and its lofty\r\nmorality, appealed strongly to the educated and leisured classes in\r\nKyoto during the peaceful Heian epoch, while for the illiterate and\r\nthe lower orders the simpler canons of the Tendai had to suffice.\r\n\r\nTHE JODO SECT\r\n\r\nIt has been shown, however, that the preachers of these sects, one\r\nand all, were readily prone to resort to violence and bloodshed in\r\npursuit of worldly interests, not even the exponents of the exalted\r\n\"True Word\" creed being exempt from the reproach. Teachers of a\r\ndoctrine having for cardinal tenet the sacredness of life, the\r\ninmates of the great monasteries nevertheless did not hesitate to\r\nappeal to arms, at any time, in defence of their temporal privileges\r\nor in pursuit of their ambitious designs. Yet the discredit attaching\r\nto such a flagrant discrepancy between precept and practice might not\r\nhave produced very signal result had not the twelfth century brought\r\nthe Gen-Hei struggle, which plunged the empire into a state of\r\nturbulence and reduced the lower orders to a condition of pitiable\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nFor this distress neither the Tendai doctrines nor the Shingon\r\nconceptions were sufficiently simple to supply a remedy. Something\r\nmore tangible and less recondite was needed, and it came (1196), in\r\nthe sequel of twenty-five years' meditation and study, to\r\nGenku--posthumously called Honen Shonin--a priest of the Tendai sect.\r\nThe leading characteristics of the Jodo (pure land) system introduced\r\nby him are easily stated. \"Salvation is by faith, but it is a faith\r\nritually expressed. The virtue that saves comes, not from imitation\r\nof, and conformity to, the person and character of the saviour,\r\nAmida, but from blind trust in his efforts and from ceaseless\r\nrepetition of pious formulae. It does not necessitate any conversion\r\nor change of heart. It is really a religion of despair rather than of\r\nhope. It says to the believer: 'The world is so very evil that you\r\ncan not possibly reach to Buddha-ship here. Your best plan,\r\ntherefore, is to give up all such hope and simply set your mind upon\r\nbeing born in Amida's paradise after death.'\"*\r\n\r\n*Lloyd's Development of Japanese Buddhism and Shinran and His Work.\r\n\r\nTHE SHIN SECT\r\n\r\nAn immediate offspring of the Jodo, though not directly following it\r\nin the chronological sequence of sects, was the Shin, established\r\n(1224) under the name of Jodo Shin-shu* (True Sect of Jodo), and\r\nowing its inception to Shinran, a pupil of Genku. It was even simpler\r\nand less exacting than its parent, the Jodo-shu, for it logically\r\nargued that if faith alone was necessary to salvation, the believer\r\nneed not trouble himself about metaphysical subtleties and profound\r\nspeculations; nor need he perform acts of religion and devotion; nor\r\nneed he keep a multitude of commandments; nor need he leave his home,\r\nrenounce matrimony, or live by rule. Only he must not worship any\r\nsave Amida, or pray for anything that does not concern his salvation.\r\nAs for the time of attaining salvation, the Jodo sect taught that if\r\nthe mercy of Amida be called to remembrance, he would meet the\r\nbeliever at the hour of death and conduct him to paradise; whereas\r\nShin-shu preaches that the coming of Amida was present and immediate;\r\nin other words, that \"Buddha dwelt in the heart now by faith.\"\r\n\r\n*It is called also the Monto-shu.\r\n\r\nTHE ZEN SECT\r\n\r\nIn the Jodo and the Shin sects an ample spiritual rest was provided\r\nfor the weary in mind or body, for the illiterate, and for the\r\noppressed. But there was for a time no creed which appealed specially\r\nto the military men; no body of doctrine which, while strengthening\r\nhim for the fight, could bring to him peace of mind. The Zen-shu\r\nultimately satisfied that want. Zen is the Japanese equivalent of the\r\nIndian term dhyana, which signifies \"meditation.\" In fact, the Zen is\r\na contemplative sect. Its disciples believe that, \"knowledge can be\r\ntransmitted from heart to heart without the intervention of words.\"\r\nBut though purely a contemplative rite at the time of its\r\nintroduction into Japan, 1168, it was subsequently modified--from\r\n1223--by two teachers, in whose hands it took the form known as the\r\nSoto sect. This \"joined scholarship and research to contemplation,\"\r\nand taught that, when the highest wisdom and most perfect\r\nenlightenment are attained, all the elements of phenomenal existence\r\nare seen to be empty, vain, and unreal. \"Form does not differ from\r\nspace or space from form; all things surrounding us are stripped of\r\ntheir qualities, so that in this highest state of enlightenment,\r\nthere can be no longer birth or death, defilement or purity, addition\r\nor destruction. There is, therefore, no such thing as ignorance, and\r\ntherefore none of the miseries that result from it. If there is no\r\nmisery, decay, or death, there is no such thing as wisdom, and no\r\nsuch thing as attaining to happiness or rest. Hence, to arrive at\r\nperfect emancipation we must grasp the fact of utter and entire\r\nvoid.\" Such a creed effectually fortified the heart of a soldier.\r\nDeath ceased to have any terrors for him or the grave any reality.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: NICHIREN PREACHING IN THE STREET\r\n\r\nTHE NICHIREN SECT\r\n\r\nThis is the only one among Japanese sects of Buddhism that derives\r\nits name from that of its founder. And justly so, for Nichiren's\r\npersonality pervades it. The son of a fisherman, from youth he\r\napplied himself to the study of Buddhism, became a bonze of the\r\nShingon sect, and took the name of Nichiren (lotus of the sun). He,\r\ntoo, studied originally at Hiei-zan under Tendai tutors, but he\r\nultimately followed an eclectic path of his own, which led him to the\r\n\"Scripture of the Lotus of Good Law,\" and he taught that salvation\r\ncould be attained merely by chaunting the formula, \"namu myo ho renge\r\nkyo\" (\"hail to the Scripture of the Lotus of Good Law\") with\r\nsufficient fervour and iteration. In fact, Nichiren's methods partook\r\nof those of the modern Salvation Army. He was distinguished, also, by\r\nthe fanatical character of his propagandism. Up to his time, Japanese\r\nBuddhism had been nothing if not tolerant. The friars were quick to\r\ntake up arms for temporal purposes, but sectarian aggressiveness was\r\nvirtually unknown until Nichiren undertook to denounce everyone\r\ndiffering from his views.* His favourite formula for denouncing other\r\nsects was, \"nembutsu mugen, Zen temma, Shingon bokoku, Ritsu\r\nkokuzoku\" (\"incantations are phantasms; the Zen is a demon; the\r\nShingon, national ruin; and the Ritsu, a rebel\"). Nichiren gained\r\ngreat credit for predicting, on the eve of the Mongol invasion, that\r\na heavy calamity was about to fall upon the country, but owing to an\r\naccusation of political intrigues, he was first condemned to be\r\nbeheaded, and then was banished to the island of Sado. His sentence\r\nwas soon revoked, however, by the regent Tokimune, who granted him\r\nwritten permission to propagate his doctrines. Thereafter the spread\r\nof his sect was very rapid.\r\n\r\n*Out of some 72,000 temples in Japan to-day, 20,000, approximately,\r\nbelong to the Shin sect; an equal number to the Zen; 13.000 to the\r\nShingon; 8000 to the Jodo; and smaller numbers to the rest.\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nWith the decentralization of the administrative power there was a\r\ncorresponding growth of the vassal class. Of course the Court nobles\r\nhad vassals in their households, but the power exercised over these\r\nvassals had legal limits, whereas the vassals of the provincial\r\nchiefs were liable to imprisonment or even death by order of their\r\nchiefs. One result was that the provinces came gradually into\r\npossession of a large body of men skilled in arms and in\r\nadministration. Moreover, among these provincial vassals, men\r\noriginally of humble origin, found themselves raised to the level of\r\nhonoured subjects, and a man's status came to be determined by his\r\noccupation rather than by his lineage. The lines of this new\r\ndiscrimination were fourfold, namely, shi, no, ko, sho--that is to\r\nsay, military, agricultural, industrial, and commercial. The\r\ntradesman stood at the bottom of the scale, and the farmer, as the\r\nprincipal taxpayer, ranked next to the military man. It will be\r\nobserved that this classification does not include any persons whose\r\noccupation involved pollution. This was a result of religious\r\nprejudice. Degradation attended every profession that required\r\ncontact with the sick, the dead, or offal of any kind. Persons\r\npractising such callings were designated eta (men of many\r\nimpurities). All belonging to the class inferior to tradesmen were\r\noriginally regarded as outlaws, but subsequently, when society was\r\nreorganized on a military basis, an official was specially entrusted\r\nwith absolute control over persons excluded from the quadruple\r\nclassification of soldier, farmer, mechanic, and merchant. Beggars\r\nconstituted an important section of the outcasts (hiniri). Next to\r\nthem were professional caterers for amusement, from dog-trainers,\r\nsnake-charmers, riddle-readers, acrobats, and trainers of animals, to\r\nbrothel-keepers and executioners.\r\n\r\nDWELLING-HOUSES\r\n\r\nDuring the two centuries from the middle of the twelfth, aristocratic\r\ndwellings in the capital underwent little change. Military\r\nresidences, however, developed some special features, though, in\r\ngeneral, their architecture was of the simplest character. They had\r\ntwo enclosures, each surrounded by a boarded fence, and the whole was\r\nencircled by a fosse crossed by outer and inner gates. There were\r\nranges for archery and there were watch-towers, but the dwelling\r\nitself was small and plain. It consisted mainly of a hall, having a\r\ndais with a lacquered chair for important visitors; an apartment for\r\nwomen; a servants' room, and a kitchen, heat being obtained from a\r\nhearth sunk in the floor. Austere simplicity was everywhere aimed at,\r\nand it is related that great provincial chiefs did not think the\r\nveranda too lowly for a sleeping-place. The use of the tatami was\r\ngreatly extended after the twelfth century. No longer laid on the\r\ndais only, these mats were used to cover the whole of the floors, and\r\npresently they were supplemented by cushions made of silk crepe\r\nstuffed with cotton-wool. In the great majority of cases, roofs were\r\ncovered with boards. Only in the houses of magnates was recourse had\r\nto tiles imported from China or slates of copper-bronze. In the\r\nbetter class of house, the roof-boards were held in place by girders,\r\nbut humble folks used logs of timber, or stones, to prevent\r\nwind-stripping, and these weights imparted an untidy, rude appearance\r\nto the structure.\r\n\r\nCOSTUME\r\n\r\nA notable feature of costume in this era was that the skirt of an\r\nofficial's outer garment had to be long in proportion to his rank.\r\nBut military men did not observe this rule. It was followed only by\r\nthe comparatively effeminate Court nobles and civil officials, who\r\nshaved their eyebrows, painted their cheeks, and blackened their\r\nteeth, as women did. While the soldiers of the Kamakura period wore\r\ntheir hair short and shaved the top of the head,--possibly for\r\ngreater comfort when they were accoutred in heavy helmets,--the Court\r\nnoble and the exquisite of the day wore their hair long and gathered\r\nin a queue which was bound with paper.\r\n\r\nAs for women, long hair was counted a beauty, and when a lady of rank\r\nleft the house, her tresses were gathered in a box carried by an\r\nattendant who walked behind; and when she seated herself, this\r\nattendant's duty was to spread the hair symmetrically on the ground\r\nlike a skirt. Girls in their teens had a pretty fashion of wearing\r\ntheir hair in three clearly distinguished lengths--a short fringe\r\nover the forehead, two cascades falling below the shoulders, and a\r\nlong lock behind. Women's hairdressing was simple in one respect:\r\nthey wore no ornaments in the hair. Aristocratic ladies continued to\r\nwear loose trousers, but robes with skirts began to form a part of\r\nthe costume of the lower classes and of unmarried girls. The girdle,\r\nso characteristic of Japanese habiliments in later days, had not yet\r\ncome into use. Its predecessor was a narrow belt of silk encircling\r\nthe waist and knotted in front, the outer garment being a long\r\nflowing robe, reaching from the neck to the heels and having\r\nvoluminous sleeves. Female headgear was various. A woman walking\r\nabroad wore a large hat like an inverted bowl, and when she rode on\r\nhorseback, she suspended from the rim of this hat a curtain from\r\nthree to four feet long.\r\n\r\nThere were other fashions, but only one of them need be mentioned,\r\nnamely, a hood to envelop the face so that the eyes alone remained\r\nvisible. In the city streets women of the town wore a distinctive\r\ncostume as courtesans did in certain parts of Europe in the Middle\r\nAges. The badge in Japan was a spirally twisted pyramidal cap of\r\nlinen, about a foot and a half high. The materials of which clothing\r\nwere made varied from rich Chinese brocade to coarse homespun, but,\r\nin general, the use of brocade was forbidden except to persons who\r\nhad received it as a gift from the Court in Kyoto or Kamakura.\r\nHistorical mention is first made of badges during the war of the\r\nMinamoto and the Taira. Their use was originally confined to purposes\r\nof distinction, and ultimately they came to be employed as a family\r\ncrest by military men. A chrysanthemum flower with sixteen petals and\r\na bunch of Paulownia leaves and buds constituted the Imperial badges,\r\nthe use of which was interdicted to all subjects. It is not to be\r\nsupposed, however, that badges were necessarily a mark of\r\naristocracy: they might be woven or dyed on the garments of\r\ntradespeople or manufacturers. Footgear, also, offered opportunities\r\nfor embellishment. Common people wore brown-leather socks, but those\r\nof position used blue leather having decorative designs embroidered\r\nin white thread.\r\n\r\nBRAZIERS, ETC.\r\n\r\nBraziers now came into general use, and quickly became objects of\r\nornament as well as of utility. Manufactured of brass or bronze, and\r\nsometimes even of silver, they had decorative designs repousse or\r\nchiselled, and sometimes they took the shape of a metal receptacle\r\ninserted in a case of finely grained or richly lacquered wood.\r\nAnother important warming utensil was the kotatsu, a latticed wooden\r\nframe enclosing a brazier and covered by a quilt. Lanterns were also\r\nemployed. They consisted of a candle fixed in a skeleton frame on\r\nwhich an envelope of thin paper was stretched. Their introduction was\r\nquickly followed by that of a kind of match which took the form of a\r\nthin piece of wood tipped with sulphur.\r\n\r\nDIET\r\n\r\nThe military class did not allow themselves to be influenced by any\r\nreligious scruples in their choice of viands. They ate everything\r\nexcept the flesh of oxen or horses. In serving meals, tables of\r\nChinese form ceased altogether to be used, edibles being placed on a\r\ntray which stood about four inches high. These trays and cups, and\r\nthe bowls and plates ranged on them, showed great refinement, rich\r\nlacquer, silver, and gold being freely used in aristocratic\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nAgriculture was, of course, greatly interrupted by the long\r\ncontinuance of military campaigns; but, on the other hand, it\r\nreceived every encouragement from the Minamoto and the Hojo. The most\r\nimportant incident of the era in this context was the introduction of\r\nthe tea-shrub from China in 1191. As for industrial pursuits, signal\r\nprogress took place in the art of tempering steel. The Japanese\r\nswordsmith forged the most trenchant weapon ever produced by any\r\nnation. The ceramic industry, also, underwent great development from\r\nthe thirteenth century onwards. It may be said to have owed its\r\nartistic beginning to Kato Shirozaemon Kagemasa, who visited China at\r\nthat time, and \"learned the art of applying glaze to pottery biscuit,\r\na feat not previously achieved in Japan.\" Another profession carried\r\nto high excellence was the sculpturing of Buddhist images. This\r\nreached its acme in a celebrated bronze Buddha which was set up at\r\nKamakura, in 1252, and which remains to this day \"one of the most\r\nmajestic creations of art in any country.\"\r\n\r\nSUMPTUARY EDICTS\r\n\r\nThe laws enacted by the Hojo regents bear ample testimony to their\r\ndesire of enforcing frugality. In the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, they went so far as to interdict the brewing of sake\r\nthroughout the empire, and another ordinance vetoed the serving of\r\ncakes at meals. Such interdicts could not possibly be strictly\r\nenforced, but they undoubtedly exercised much influence, so that the\r\nsamurai limited themselves to two meals a day and partook only of the\r\ncoarsest fare.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: WRESTLERS\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DAIMYO'S GATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nFALL OF THE HOJO AND RISE OF THE ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nTHE DAYS OF SADATOKI\r\n\r\nWITH the accession (1284) of the seventh Hojo regent, Sadatoki, the\r\nprosperous era of the Bakufu came to an end. Sadatoki himself seems\r\nto have been a man of much ability and fine impulses. He succeeded\r\nhis father, Tokimune, at the age of fourteen, and during nine years\r\nhe remained under the tutelage of the prime minister, Taira no\r\nYoritsuna, thereafter taking the reins of government into his own\r\nhands. The annals are unfortunately defective at this, period. They\r\nfail to explain the reason for Sadatoki's retirement and adoption of\r\nreligion, in 1301, after eight years of active rule. It may be that\r\nthe troubles of the time disgusted him. For alike politically and\r\nfinancially an evil state of affairs prevailed. In 1286, the Adachi\r\nclan, falling under suspicion of aiming at the shogunate, was\r\nextirpated. A few years later, the same fate overtook Taira no\r\nYoritsuna, who had been the chief accuser of the Adachi, and who,\r\nbeing now charged by his own first-born with coveting the regency\r\n(shikken), was put to death with his second son and all his\r\nretainers. Yet again, three years subsequently to this latter\r\ntragedy, Yoshimi, a scion of Yoritomo's brother, the unfortunate\r\nYoshinori, fell a victim to accusations of treachery, and it needed\r\nno great insight to appreciate that the Bakufu was becoming a house\r\ndivided against itself.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, also, that the military families of the Kwanto\r\nin general and of Kamakura in particular began to find their incomes\r\ndistressingly inadequate to meet the greatly increased and constantly\r\nincreasing outlays that resulted from following the costly customs of\r\nKyoto as reflected at the shogun's palace. Advantage was taken of\r\nthis condition by professional money-lenders, by ambitious nobles,\r\nand even by wealthy farmers, who, supplying funds at exorbitant rates\r\nof interest, obtained possession of valuable estates. The Bakufu made\r\nseveral futile legislative essays to amend this state of affairs, and\r\nfinally, in the year 1297, they resorted to a ruinous device called\r\ntokusei, or the \"benevolent policy.\" This consisted in enacting a law\r\nwhich vetoed all suits for the recovery of interest, cancelled all\r\nmortgages, and interdicted the pledging of military men's property.\r\n\r\nOf course, such legislation proved disastrous. Whatever temporary\r\nrelief it afforded to indigent and improvident debtors, was far\r\noutweighed by the blow given to credit generally, and by the\r\nindignation excited among creditors. The Bakufu owed much of the\r\nstability of their influence to the frugality of their lives and to\r\ntheir unsullied administration of justice. But now the Kwanto bushi\r\nrivalled the Kyoto gallants in extravagance; the Kamakura tribunals\r\nforfeited the confidence of the people, and the needy samurai began\r\nto wish for the return of troublous times, when fortunes could be won\r\nwith the sword. Amid such conditions Sadatoki took the tonsure in\r\n1300, and was succeeded nominally by his cousin Morotoki, who,\r\nhowever, administered affairs in consultation with the retired\r\nregent. In 1303, a son was born to Sadatoki, and the latter, dying in\r\n1311, bequeathed the office of regent to this boy when he should\r\nreach years of discretion, entrusting him, meanwhile, to the\r\nguardianship of two officials, the more active of whom was a lay\r\npriest, Nagasaki Enki.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the confusion existing at that time in Kamakura may be\r\ngathered from the fact that, during the five years between the death\r\nof Sadatoki and the accession of his son Takatoki (1316), no less\r\nthan four members of the Hojo family held the regency in succession.\r\nTakatoki was destined to be the last of the Hojo regents. Coming into\r\npower at the age of thirteen, his natural giddiness of character is\r\nsaid to have been deliberately encouraged by his guardian, Nagasaki,\r\nbut even had he been a stronger man it is doubtful whether he could\r\nhave saved the situation. Corruption had eaten deeply into the heart\r\nof the Bakufu. In 1323, a question concerning right of succession to\r\nthe Ando estate was carried to Kamakura for adjudication, and the\r\nchief judge, Nagasaki Takasuke, son of the old lay priest mentioned\r\nabove, having taken bribes from both of the litigants, delivered an\r\ninscrutable opinion. Save for its sequel, this incident would merely\r\nhave to be catalogued with many cognate injustices which disfigured\r\nthe epoch. But the Ando family being one of the most powerful in\r\nnorthern Japan, its rival representatives appealed to arms in support\r\nof their respective claims, and the province of Oshu was thrown into\r\nsuch confusion that a force had to be sent from Kamakura to restore\r\norder. This expedition failed, and with its failure the prestige of\r\nthe Hojo fell in a region where hitherto it had been untarnished--the\r\narena of arms. The great Japanese historian, Rai Sanyo, compared the\r\nBakufu of that time to a tree beautiful outwardly but worm-eaten at\r\nthe core, and in the classical work, Taiheiki, the state of affairs\r\nis thus described:\r\n\r\nThe Dengaku mime was then in vogue among all classes in Kyoto.\r\nTakatoki, hearing of this, summoned two rival troupes of Dengaku\r\nplayers to Kamakura and witnessed their performances without regard\r\nto the passage of time. He distributed the members of the troupes\r\namong the noble families related to the Hojo, and made these nobles\r\ncompete to furnish the performers with magnificent costumes. At a\r\nbanquet when a Dengaku mime was acted, the regent and his guests vied\r\nwith one another in pulling off their robes and throwing them into a\r\nheap, to be redeemed afterwards for heavy sums which were given to\r\nthe actors. The custom thus inaugurated became perpetual. One day, a\r\nnumber of dogs gathered in the garden of Takatoki's mansion and had a\r\nfight. This so amused the regent that orders were despatched to\r\ncollect dogs by way of taxes, the result being that many people in\r\nthe provinces took steps to breed dogs and presented them by tens or\r\nscores to Kamakura, where they were fed on fish and fowl, kept in\r\nkennels having gold and silver ornaments, and carried in palanquins\r\nto take the air. When these distinguished animals were borne along\r\nthe public thoroughfares, people hastening hither and thither on\r\nbusiness had to dismount and kneel in obeisance, and farmers, instead\r\nof cultivating the fields, had to act as bearers of the dogs'\r\nsedan-chairs. Thus, the city of Kamakura presented the curious\r\nspectacle of a town filled with well-fed dogs, clothed in tinsel and\r\nbrocades, and totalling from four to five thousand. Twelve days in\r\nevery month used to be devoted to dog-fights, and on these occasions,\r\nthe regent, the nobles, and the people inside and outside the mansion\r\nused to assemble as spectators, sitting on the verandas or the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nTHE COURT IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nAll these things were watched with keen interest in Kyoto. It has\r\nbeen shown in Chapter XXVI that the Imperial family had been divided\r\ninto two branches ever since the days of Go-Saga (1242-1246), one\r\ndescended from his elder son, Go-Fukakusa, the other from his\r\nyounger, Kameyama. These two branches may be conveniently\r\ndistinguished as the senior and the junior, respectively. It has also\r\nbeen shown that the princes of the senior branch uniformly relied on\r\nKamakura and kept the Bakufu informed of all intrigues devised in\r\nKyoto, whereas those of the junior branch constantly cherished the\r\nhope of reasserting the independence of the throne. A representative\r\nof the junior branch, Go-Daigo (1318-1339), happened to be on the\r\nthrone when Takatoki, holding the regency at Kamakura, scandalized\r\nthe nation by his excesses and discredited the Hojo by his\r\nincompetence.\r\n\r\nGo-Daigo was an able sovereign. He dispensed justice scrupulously and\r\nmade the good of the country his prime aim. It appeared to him that\r\nthe time had come for Kyoto to shake off the fetters of Kamakura.\r\nWith that object he took into his confidence two Fujiwara nobles,\r\nSuketomo, a councillor of State, and Toshimoto, minister of Finance.\r\nThese he despatched on a secret tour of inspection through the\r\nprovinces, instructing them at the same time to canvass for adherents\r\namong the local samurai. They met with considerable success. Among\r\nthe provincial families there were some of Taira origin who cherished\r\ntraditional hatred towards the Minamoto; there were some of Minamoto\r\nblood who chafed at the supremacy of the Hojo, and there were some\r\nwho, independently of lineage, longed for a struggle and its\r\ncontingent possibilities. Leading representatives of these classes\r\nbegan to hold conclaves in Kyoto. The meetings were marked by\r\ncomplete absence of ceremony, their object being to promote free\r\ninterchange of ideas. Presently, suspicions were suggested to\r\nKamakura. The regent, Takatoki, who, though a careless libertine in\r\nhis habits, living in the society of his thirty concubines, his\r\ntroops of dancing mimes, and his packs of fighting dogs, was capable\r\nof stern resolution on occasions, threatened to dethrone the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIn this sore strait, Go-Daigo did not hesitate to make solemn avowal\r\nof the innocence of his purpose, and Kamakura refrained from any\r\nharsh action towards the Throne. But it fared ill with the\r\nsovereign's chief confidant, Fujiwara no Suketomo. He was exiled to\r\nSado Island and there killed by Takatoki's instructions. This\r\nhappened in 1325. Connected with it was an incident which illustrates\r\nthe temper of the bushi. In spite of his mother's tearful\r\nremonstrances, Kunimitsu, the thirteen-year-old son of the exiled\r\nnoble, set out from Kyoto for Sado to bid his father farewell. The\r\ngovernor of the island was much moved by the boy's affection, but,\r\nfearful of Kamakura, he refused to sanction a meeting and\r\ncommissioned one Homma Saburo, a member of his family, to kill the\r\nprisoner. Kunimitsu determined to avenge his father, even at the\r\nexpense of his own life. During a stormy night, he effected an entry\r\ninto the governor's mansion, and, penetrating to Saburo's chamber,\r\nkilled him. The child then turned his weapon against his own bosom.\r\nBut, reflecting that he had his mother to care for, his sovereign to\r\nserve, and his father's will to carry out, he determined to escape if\r\npossible. The mansion was surrounded by a deep moat which he could\r\nnot cross. But a bamboo grew on the margin, and climbing up this, he\r\nfound that it bent with his weight so as to form a bridge. He reached\r\nKyoto in safety and ultimately attained the high post (chunagon)\r\nwhich his father had held.\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThe year 1326 witnessed the decease of the Crown Prince, Kuninaga,\r\nwho represented the senior branch of the Imperial family. Thereupon,\r\nGo-Daigo conceived the project of appointing his own son, Morinaga,\r\nto be Prince Imperial. That would have given the sceptre twice in\r\nsuccession to the junior branch, and the Bakufu regent, insisting\r\nthat the rule of alternate succession must be followed, proposed to\r\nnominate Prince Kazuhito, a son of the cloistered Emperor,\r\nGo-Fushimi, who belonged to the senior branch. The question was\r\nvehemently discussed at Kamakura, Go-Daigo being represented by\r\nFujiwara no Fujifusa, and Go-Fushimi by another noble. The former\r\ncontended that never since the days of Jimmu had any subject dared to\r\nimpose his will on the Imperial family. Go-Saga's testament had\r\nclearly provided the order of succession to the throne, yet the\r\nBakufu had ventured to set that testament aside and had dictated the\r\nsystem of alternate succession. Thus, the princes of the elder branch\r\nnot only became eligible for the throne, but also enjoyed great\r\nrevenues from the Ghokodo estate, though it had been bequeathed as a\r\nsolatium for exclusion from the succession; whereas the princes of\r\nthe junior branch, when not occupying the throne, were without a foot\r\nof land or the smallest source of income. Fujifusa was instructed to\r\nclaim that the usufruct of the Chokodo estate should alternate in the\r\nsame manner as the succession, or that the latter should be\r\nperpetually vested in the junior branch. To this just demand the\r\nregent, Takatoki, refused to accede. Kazuhito was named Prince\r\nImperial, and thus the seeds of a sanguinary struggle were sown.\r\n\r\nCONSPIRACY IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nGo-Daigo now conspired actively for the overthrow of the Hojo. He\r\ntook Prince Morinaga into his confidence, and, under the name Oto no\r\nMiya, made him lord-abbot of the great monastery of Hiei-zan, thus\r\nsecuring at once a large force of soldier cenobites. To the same end\r\nother religious establishments were successfully approached. During\r\nthe space of five years this plot escaped Kamakura's attention. But,\r\nin 1331, the Bakufu, becoming suspicious, laid hands on several of\r\nthe plotters and, subjecting them to judicial examination after the\r\nmerciless fashion of the age, soon elicited a part, at any rate, of\r\nthe truth. Yet Kamakura does not appear to have appreciated the\r\nsituation until, Go-Daigo having summoned the Enryaku monks to his\r\nassistance, the cloistered Emperor of the senior branch, Go-Fushimi,\r\ndespatched an urgent message to the Bakufu, declaring that unless\r\nprompt action were taken the situation would elude control.\r\n\r\nHasty council was now held in Kamakura. Nagasaki Takasuke, the\r\ncorrupt kwanryo, advised that Go-Daigo should be dethroned and sent\r\ninto exile, together with Oto no Miya, and that all implicated in the\r\nplot should be severely punished. This violent course was opposed by\r\nNikaido Sadafusa, who pleaded eloquently for the respect due to the\r\nThrone, and contended that without the sovereign's favour the Bakufu\r\ncould not exist. But Takasuke's advice prevailed, re-enforced as it\r\nwas by reference to the Shokyu disturbance when vigorous daring had\r\nwon the day. With all possible expedition an army under the command\r\nof Sadafusa marched from Kamakura for Kyoto. Advised of these doings,\r\nPrince Morinaga persuaded the Emperor to change costumes with\r\nFujiwara Morokata; whereafter the latter, riding in the Imperial\r\npalanquin, took ostensible refuge at Hiei-zan, and the sovereign,\r\ntravelling in a Court lady's ox-car, made his way, first, to Nara and\r\nthence to Kasagi in Yamato, guarded by the troops of Fujiwara\r\nFujifusa. Rokuhara was then under the command of Hojo Nakatoki, and\r\nupon him devolved the duty of seizing the Emperor's person. He\r\ndirected an army against Hiei-zan, where Go-Daigo was believed to\r\nhave found asylum. But Fujiwara Morokata, who personified the\r\nsovereign, managed to escape, as did also Prince Morinaga (Oto no\r\nMiya). Go-Daigo then sent to Kusunoki Masashige a mandate to raise\r\ntroops and move against the \"rebels,\" for to that category the Hojo\r\nnow belonged in the absence of an Imperial commission.\r\n\r\nThis Kusunoki Masashige (called Nanko) is one of Japan's ideal types\r\nof loyalty and courage. He and Nitta Yoshisada are the central\r\nfigures in the long campaign upon which Japan now entered. Masashige\r\nbelonged to the Tachibana family, which stood second among the four\r\ngreat septs of Japan--the Fujiwara, the Tachibana, the Minamoto, and\r\nthe Taira--and Yoshisada claimed kinship with the Minamoto. Receiving\r\nGo-Daigo's order, Kusunoki Masashige quickly collected a troop of\r\nlocal bushi and constructed entrenchments at Akasaka, a naturally\r\nstrong position in his native province of Kawachi. Takatoki now\r\ncaused Prince Kazuhito to be proclaimed sovereign under the name of\r\nKogon. But this monarch was not destined to find a place among the\r\nrecognized occupants of the throne. For a time, indeed, fortune\r\nsmiled on the Hojo. Within a few days after Kogon's assumption of the\r\nsceptre, Go-Daigo's retreat at Kasagi became untenable, and he fled,\r\nstill escorted by the faithful Fujiwara Fujifusa. It must be\r\nrecognized that, whatever the Fujiwara family's usurpations in the\r\npast, their loyalty to the Throne throughout this era of cruel\r\nvicissitudes redeems a multitude of sins.\r\n\r\nDuring his flight from Kasagi, the Emperor was without food for three\r\ndays, and had to sleep with a rock for pillow. Overtaken by the\r\nRokuhara troops, his Majesty was placed in a bamboo palanquin and\r\ncarried to the temple Byodoin, where, after the battle of the Uji\r\nBridge, the aged statesman and general, Yorimasa, had fallen by his\r\nown hand, a century and a half previously. Here Go-Daigo received a\r\nperemptory order to surrender the Imperial insignia to the Hojo\r\nnominee, Kogon. He refused. The mirror and gem, he alleged, had been\r\nlost, and there remained only the sacred sword, which he kept to\r\ndefend himself against the traitors when they fell upon him. The high\r\ncourage of this answer would have been finer had Go-Daigo's statement\r\nbeen true; but in reality the three insignia were intact. It was then\r\nannounced to his Majesty that he should be removed to Rokuhara where\r\nhe would be entirely in the power of the Hojo. Nevertheless, he\r\nmaintained his lofty bearing, and refused to make the journey unless\r\nall appropriate forms of etiquette were observed. At Rokuhara the\r\ndemand for the insignia was repeated and the Emperor handed over\r\nduplicates, secretly retaining the genuine articles himself. Takatoki\r\nnow issued orders for Go-Daigo to be removed to the island of Oki,\r\nsent all the members of his family into exile elsewhere, and banished\r\nor killed his principal supporters.\r\n\r\nRAISING OF A LOYAL ARMY\r\n\r\nKusunoki Masashige had but five hundred men under his command when he\r\nentrenched himself at Akasaka. There for twenty days he held out\r\nagainst the attacks of the greatly superior Hojo forces, until\r\nfinally, no help arriving and his provisions being exhausted, he\r\nwould have committed suicide had he not realized that his life\r\nbelonged to the Imperial cause. He contrived to escape through the\r\nenemy's lines, and thus the only organized loyal force that remained\r\nin the field was that operating in Bingo under the command of\r\nSakurayama Koretoshi. Thither a false rumour of Masashige's death\r\nhaving been carried, Koretoshi's troops dispersed and he himself\r\ncommitted suicide. Kojima Takanori, too, commonly known as Bingo no\r\nSaburo, was about to raise the banner of loyalty when the false news\r\nof Masashige's death reached him. This Takanori is the hero of an\r\nincident which appeals strongly to the Japanese love of the romantic.\r\nLearning that the Emperor was being transported into exile in the\r\nisland of Oki, and having essayed to rescue him en route, he made his\r\nway during the night into the enclosure of the inn where the Imperial\r\nparty had halted, and having scraped off part of the bark of a cherry\r\ntree, he inscribed on the trunk the couplet:\r\n\r\n   Heaven destroy not Kou Chien,\r\n   He is not without a Fan Li.\r\n\r\nThis alluded to an old-time Chinese king (Kou Chien) who, after\r\ntwenty years of exile, was restored to power by the efforts of a\r\nvassal (Fan Li). The Emperor's guards, being too illiterate to\r\ncomprehend the reference, showed the writing to Go-Daigo, who thus\r\nlearned that friends were at hand. But Takanori could not accomplish\r\nanything more, and for a season the fortunes of the Throne were at a\r\nvery low ebb, while at Kamakura the regent resumed his life of\r\ndebauchery. Neither Prince Morinaga nor Masashige was idle, however.\r\nBy skilful co-operation they recovered the entrenchments at Akasaka\r\nand overran the two provinces of Izumi and Kawachi, gaining many\r\nadherents. The fall of 1332 saw Masashige strongly posted at the\r\nChihaya fortress on Kongo Mountain; his lieutenants holding Akasaka;\r\nPrince Morinaga in possession of Yoshino Castle, and Akamatsu\r\nNorimura of Harima blocking the two highways called the Sanindo and\r\nthe Sanyodo.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Imperialists held the group of provinces forming\r\nthe northern littoral of the Inland Sea and commanded the approaches\r\nfrom the south. But now again Kamakura put forth its strength. At the\r\nclose of February, 1333, a numerous force under the Hojo banners\r\nattacked Yoshino and its fall became inevitable. Prince Morinaga,\r\nwounded in several places, had resolved to make the castle his\r\n\"death-pillow,\" when he was saved by one of those acts of heroic\r\ndevotion so frequently recorded in the annals of the Japanese bushi.\r\nMurakami Yoshiteru insisted on donning the prince's armour and\r\npersonating him so as to cover his retreat. At the supreme moment,\r\nYoshiteru ascended the tower of the entrenchments and loudly\r\nproclaiming himself the prince, committed suicide. His son would fain\r\nhave shared his fate, but Yoshiteru bade him live for further\r\nservice. Subsequently, he fell fighting against Morinaga's pursuers,\r\nbut the prince escaped safely to the great monastery of Koya in\r\nKishu.* The victorious Hojo then turned their arms against Akasaka,\r\nand having carried that position, attacked Chihaya where Masashige\r\ncommanded in person. But the great soldier held his foes successfully\r\nat bay and inflicted heavy losses on them. Thus, the early months of\r\n1333 witnessed a brighter state of affairs for the Imperial cause. It\r\nwas supported by Kusunoki Masashige, in Yamato, with Chihaya for\r\nheadquarters; Prince Morinaga, at Koya-san in Kishu; Akamatsu\r\nNorimura, in Harima and Settsu, whence his fortress of Maya menaced\r\nRokuhara, and by Doi Michiharu and Tokuno Michikoto, in Iyo, whence,\r\ncrossing to Nagato, they had attacked and defeated Hojo Tokinao, the\r\ntandai of the province.\r\n\r\n*Yoshiteru's loyal sacrifice received official recognition, in 1908,\r\non the occasion of military manoeuvres in the neighbourhood of the\r\nscene of the tragedy. The Emperor honoured his memory by bestowing on\r\nhim high posthumous rank.\r\n\r\nESCAPE OF THE EMPEROR FROM OKI\r\n\r\nThe Oki group of islands lie in the Sea of Japan forty miles from the\r\ncoast of the provinces Izumo and Hoki. Beppu, in Nishi-no-shima, one\r\nof the smallest of the group, was Go-Daigo's place of exile. By\r\nemploying the services of a fishing-boat, Prince Morinaga succeeded\r\nin conveying to his Majesty some intelligence of the efforts that\r\nwere being made in the Imperial cause. This was early in 1333, and\r\nwhen the news spread among the guards at Beppu, they began to talk of\r\nthe duties of loyalty. Narita Kosaburo and the Nawa brothers,\r\nYasunaga and Nagataka--the name of the last was afterwards changed by\r\nthe Emperor to Nagatoshi--thus became associated in a scheme for\r\nassisting the exile to recover his freedom. To remove him from\r\nNishi-no-Shima was not difficult to contrive, but to traverse the\r\nprovinces of Izumo or Hoki en route for a safe asylum seemed at first\r\nimpossible, for in Izumo not only the governor but also the chief\r\nofficial of the great Shinto shrine were hostile, and in Hoki the\r\nstrictest watchfulness had been enjoined from Rokuhara.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it became necessary to make the attempt at once or\r\nrefrain altogether. On the 8th of April, 1333, the guards at Beppu\r\nwere given a quantity of sake on the plea that the accouchement of a\r\nCourt lady was imminent. Custom prescribed that in such a case the\r\nlady should be removed to a different house, and therefore when the\r\nguards had well drunk, a palanquin was carried out, bearing\r\nostensibly this lady only, but in reality freighted with the\r\nsovereign also. The night was passed in the village, and at daybreak\r\nthe little party, leaving the lady behind, set out on foot for the\r\nnearest seaport, Chiba. The Emperor could scarcely walk, but happily\r\na man was encountered leading a pack-horse, and on this Go-Daigo\r\nrode. The next three days were devoted to seeking a safe landing in\r\nIzumo and endeavouring to procure provisions. On one occasion, being\r\npursued by servants of the great shrine, they had to re-embark and\r\nput out to sea, the Emperor and his sole attendant, Tadaaki, lying\r\nhid in the bottom of the boat beneath a quantity of seaweed and under\r\nthe feet of the sailors. Finally, on the 13th of April, they made\r\nKatami port in the province of Hoki, and, being cordially welcomed by\r\nNawa Nagataka, Go-Daigo was ultimately taken to a mountain called\r\nFunanoe, which offered excellent defensive facilities. It is recorded\r\nthat on the first stage of this journey from Nagataka's residence to\r\nthe mountain, the Emperor had to be carried on the back of Nagataka's\r\nbrother, Nagashige, no palanquin being available. Very soon many\r\nbushi flocked to the Imperial standard and Funanoe was strongly\r\nentrenched. It was on this occasion that Go-Daigo changed Nagataka's\r\nname to Nagatoshi, and conferred on him the title of \"captain of the\r\nLeft guards\" (saemon-no-jo).\r\n\r\nDOWNFALL OF THE HOJO\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor's escape from Oki became known, loyal samurai in\r\ngreat numbers espoused the Imperial cause, and a heavy blow was given\r\nto the prestige of the Hojo by Akamatsu Norimura who, after several\r\nsuccessful engagements with the Rokuhara army in Settsu, pushed\r\nnorthward from the fortress of Maya, where his forces were almost\r\nwithin sight of Kyoto. Takatoki, appreciating that a crisis had now\r\narisen in the fortunes of the Hojo, ordered Ashikaga Takauji to lead\r\na powerful army westward. Takauji represented a junior branch of the\r\nMinamoto family. He was descended from the great Yoshiiye, and when\r\nYoritomo rose against the Taira, in 1180, he had been immediately\r\njoined by the then Ashikaga chieftain, who was his brother-in-law.\r\nTakau ji, therefore, had ambitions of his own, and his mood towards\r\nthe Hojo had been embittered by two recent events; the first, that,\r\nthough in mourning for the death of his father, he had been required\r\nto join the attack on Masashige's fortress at Kasagi; the second,\r\nthat his own illness after returning from that campaign had not\r\navailed to save him from frequent summonses to conference with\r\nTakatoki.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ASHIKAGA TAKAUJI\r\n\r\nThus, this second order to take the field found him disposed to join\r\nin the overthrow of the Hojo rather than in their support. Learning\r\nsomething of this mood, Takatoki demanded that the Ashikaga chief,\r\nbefore commencing his march, should hand in a written oath of\r\nloyalty, and further, should leave his wife, his children, and his\r\nbrother-in-law as hostages in Kamakura. Takauji, who shrunk from no\r\nsacrifice on the altar of his ambition, complied readily, and the\r\nconfidence of the Bakufu having thus been restored, a parting banquet\r\nwas given in his honour, at which the Hojo representative presented\r\nhim with a steed, a suit of armour, a gold-mounted sword, and a white\r\nflag, this last being an heirloom from the time of Hachiman\r\n(Yoshiiye), transmitted through the hands of Yoritomo's spouse, Masa.\r\n\r\nAll these things did not turn Takauji by a hair's-breadth from his\r\npurpose. His army had not marched many miles westward before he\r\ndespatched a message to the entrenchments in Hoki offering his\r\nservices to the Emperor, who welcomed this signal accession of\r\nstrength and commissioned Takauji to attack the Bakufu forces.\r\nEntirely ignorant of these things, Hojo Takaiye, who commanded at\r\nRokuhara, made dispositions to move against the Hoki fortress in\r\nco-operation with Takauji. The plan of campaign was that Takaiye's\r\narmy should march southward through Settsu, and, having crushed\r\nAkamatsu Norimura, who occupied that province, should advance through\r\nHarima and Mimasaka into Hoki; while Takauji, moving northward at\r\nfirst by the Tamba highway, should ultimately turn westward and reach\r\nHoki by the littoral road of the Japan Sea. In addition to these two\r\narmies, the Hojo had a powerful force engaged in beleaguering the\r\nfortress of Chihaya, in Yamato, where Kusunoki Masashige commanded in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that, at this time (May, 1333), the Imperialists\r\nwere everywhere standing on the defensive, and the Bakufu armies were\r\nattacking on the southeast, south, and north of Kyoto. Nothing seemed\r\nless probable than that the Imperial capital itself should become the\r\nobject of an assault by the partisans of Go-Daigo. But the unexpected\r\ntook place. Hojo Takaiye was killed and his force shattered in the\r\nfirst collision with Norimura, who immediately set his troops in\r\nmotion towards Kyoto, intending to take advantage of Rokuhara's\r\ndenuded condition. Meanwhile, Takauji, whose march into Tamba had\r\nbeen very deliberate, learned the course events had taken in Settsu,\r\nand immediately proclaiming his allegiance to the Imperial cause,\r\ncountermarched for Kyoto, his army receiving constant accessions of\r\nstrength as it approached the city. Rokuhara, though taken by\r\nsurprise, fought stoutly. Attacked simultaneously from three\r\ndirections by the armies of Norimura, Takauji, and Minamoto Tadaaki,\r\nand in spite of the death of their commandant, Hojo Tokimasu, they\r\nheld out until the evening, when Hojo Nakatoki escaped under cover of\r\ndarkness, escorting the titular sovereign, Kogon, and the two\r\nex-Emperors. Their idea was to flee to Kamakura, but taking an escort\r\ntoo large for rapid movement, they were overtaken; the three leaders\r\ntogether with four hundred men killed, and Kogon together with the\r\ntwo ex-Emperors seized and carried back to Kyoto.\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF KAMAKURA\r\n\r\nThese things happened at the close of June, 1333, and immediately\r\nafter the fall of Rokuhara, Nitta Yoshisada raised the Imperial\r\nstandard in the province of Kotsuke. Yoshisada represented the tenth\r\ngeneration of the great Yoshiiye's family. Like Ashikaga Takauji he\r\nwas of pure Minamoto blood, though Takauji belonged to a junior\r\nbranch. The Nitta estates were in the district of that name in the\r\nprovince of Kotsuke; that is to say, in the very heart of the Kwanto.\r\nHitherto, the whole of the eastern region had remained loyal to the\r\nHojo; but the people were growing weary of the heavy taxes and\r\nrequisitions entailed by this three-years' struggle, and when Nitta\r\nYoshisada declared against the Hojo, his ranks soon swelled to\r\nformidable dimensions. It has been stated by some historians that\r\nYoshisada's resolve was first taken on receipt of news that Rokuhara\r\nwas lost to the Hojo. But there can be no doubt that, like others of\r\nhis sept, he had long resented the comparatively subordinate position\r\noccupied by Yoritomo's descendants, and the most trustworthy annals\r\nshow that already while engaged in besieging Masashige in Chihaya\r\nfortress, he conceived the idea of deserting the Hojo's cause.\r\nThrough one of his officers, Funada Yoshimasa, he obtained a mandate\r\nfrom Prince Morinaga, and then, feigning sickness, he left the camp\r\nin Yamato and returned to Kotsuke, where he lost no time in making\r\npreparations for revolt.\r\n\r\nThis actual declaration did not come, however, until the arrival of\r\nan officer from Kamakura, carrying a requisition for a great quantity\r\nof provisions to victual an army which the Hojo were hastily\r\nequipping to recover Rokuhara. The officer was put to death, and\r\nYoshisada with his brother, Yoshisuke, set their forces in motion for\r\nKamakura. Menaced thus closely, the Hojo made a supreme effort. They\r\nput into the field an army said to have numbered one hundred thousand\r\nof all arms. But their ranks were perpetually reduced by defections,\r\nwhereas those of the Imperialists received constant accessions. The\r\ncampaign lasted only a fortnight. For the final attack Yoshisada\r\ndivided his army into three corps and advanced against Kamakura from\r\nthe north, the east, and the west. The eastern column was repulsed\r\nand its general slain, but the western onset, commanded by Yoshisada\r\nhimself, succeeded. Taking advantage of a low tide, he led his men\r\nover the sands and round the base of a steep cliff,* and carried the\r\ncity by storm, setting fire to the buildings everywhere. The Hojo\r\ntroops were shattered and slaughtered relentlessly. Takatoki\r\nretreated to his ancestral cemetery at the temple Tosho-ji, and there\r\ncommitted suicide with all the members of his family and some eight\r\nhundred officers and men of his army. Thus, Kamakura fell on the 5th\r\nof July, 1333, a century and a half after the establishment of the\r\nBakufu by Yoritomo. Many heroic incidents marked the catastrophe and\r\nshowed the spirit animating the bushi of that epoch. A few of them\r\nwill find a fitting place here.\r\n\r\n*This cliff--Inamura-ga-saki--may be seen at Kamakura to-day.\r\nTradition says that Yoshisada threw his sword into the waves,\r\nsupplicating the god of the Sea to roll back the water and open a\r\npath for the loyal army. At dawn on the following day the tide was\r\nfound to have receded sufficiently.\r\n\r\nHEROIC DEATHS\r\n\r\nIt has been related above that, when Ashikaga Takauji marched\r\nwestward from Kamakura, he left his family and his brother-in-law as\r\nhostages in the hands of the Bakufu. Subsequently, on the occasion of\r\nthe assault by Nitta Yoshisada, this brother-in-law (Akabashi\r\nMoritoki) resisted stoutly but was defeated at the pass of Kobukoro.\r\nHe committed suicide, remarking calmly, \"It is better to die trusted\r\nthan to live doubted.\"\r\n\r\nOsaragi Sadanao, one of the Hojo generals, was in danger of defeat by\r\nOdate Muneuji at the defence of Kamakura, when Homma Saemon, a\r\nretainer of the former, who was under arrest for an offence, broke\r\nhis arrest and galloping into the field, restored the situation by\r\nkilling the enemy's general, Odate Muneuji. Carrying the head of\r\nMuneuji, Saemon presented it to his chief and then disembowelled\r\nhimself in expiation of his disobedience. Sadanao, crying that his\r\nfaithful follower should not go unaccompanied to the grave, dashed\r\ninto the enemy's ranks and fell, covered with wounds.\r\n\r\nAndo Shoshu, returning from the successful defence of the eastern\r\napproaches to Kamakura on the 5th of July, 1333, found the Government\r\nbuildings a mass of charred ruins, and being ignorant of the\r\nmultitude of suicides that had taken place in the cemetery at\r\nTosho-ji, cried out: \"The end of a hundred years! How is it that none\r\nwas found to die the death of fidelity?\" Dismounting he prepared to\r\ntake his own life when a messenger arrived carrying a letter from his\r\nniece, the wife of Nitta Yoshisada. This letter counselled surrender.\r\nShoshu exclaimed furiously: \"My niece is a samurai's daughter. How\r\ncould she venture to insult me with words so shameless? And how was\r\nit that Yoshisada allowed her to do such a thing?\" Then, wrapping the\r\nletter round the hilt of his sword, he disembowelled himself.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST SCENE\r\n\r\nThe last act of the Hojo tragedy, which took place in the cemetery of\r\nthe temple Tosho-ji, showed the fidelity of the samurai character at\r\nits best. Among the Kamakura warriors was one Takashige, son of that\r\nNagasaki Takasuke who had made himself notorious by corrupt\r\nadministration of justice. Takashige, a skilled soldier of enormous\r\nphysical power, returned from the battle when all hope of beating\r\nback Nitta Yoshisada's army had disappeared, and having warned the\r\nregent, Takatoki, that the bushi's last resource alone remained,\r\nasked for a few moments' respite to strike a final stroke. Followed\r\nby a hundred desperate men, he plunged into the thick of the fight\r\nand had almost come within reach of Yoshisada when he was forced\r\nback. Galloping to Tosho-ji, he found Takatoki and his comrades\r\ndrinking their farewell cup of sake. Takatoki handed the cup to\r\nTakashige, and he, after draining it thrice, as was the samurai's\r\nwont, passed it to Settsu Dojun, disembowelled himself, and tore out\r\nhis intestines. \"That gives a fine relish to the wine,\" cried Dojun,\r\nfollowing Takashige's example. Takatoki, being of highest rank, was\r\nthe last to kill himself.\r\n\r\nEight hundred suicides bore witness to the strength of the creed held\r\nby the Kamakura bushi. An eminent Japanese author* writes: \"Yoritomo,\r\nconvinced by observation and experience that the beautiful and the\r\nsplendid appeal most to human nature, made it his aim to inculcate\r\nfrugality, to promote military exercises, to encourage loyalty, and\r\nto dignify simplicity. Moral education he set before physical. The\r\nprecepts of bushido he engraved on the heart of the nation and gave\r\nto them the honour of a precious heirloom. The Hojo, by exalting\r\nbushido, followed the invaluable teaching of the Genji, and\r\nsupplemented it with the doctrines of Shinto, Confucianism, and\r\nBuddhism. Thus every bushi came to believe that the country's fate\r\ndepended on the spirit of the samurai.\" Another and more renowned\r\nannalist** wrote: \"The Hojo, rising from a subordinate position,\r\nflourished for nine generations. Their success was due to observing\r\nfrugality, treating the people with kindness, meting out strict\r\njustice, and faithfully obeying the ancestral behest to abstain from\r\nseeking high titles.\" They took the substance and discarded the\r\nshadow. The bushido that they developed became a model in later ages,\r\nespecially in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n*Yamada Tesshu (modern).\r\n\r\n**Rai Sanyo (1780-1832).\r\n\r\nLAST HOJO ARMY\r\n\r\nWhen Kamakura fell the only Hojo force remaining in the field was\r\nthat which had been engaged for months in the siege of Chihaya, where\r\nKusunoki Masashige held his own stoutly. This army had retired to\r\nNara on receipt of the news of Rokuhara's capture, and when Kamakura\r\nmet with the same fate, the leaders of the last Hojo force\r\nsurrendered at the summons of Ashikaga Takauji's emissaries.\r\nSubsequently, fifteen of these leaders were led out at midnight and\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION OF THE KEMMU ERA\r\n\r\nThe conditions that now resulted are spoken of in Japanese history as\r\n\"the Restoration of the Kemmu era\" (1334-1336). It will be presently\r\nseen that the term is partly misleading. After his escape from Oki,\r\nGo-Daigo remained for some time in the fortress of Funanoe, in Hoki.\r\nKamakura fell on the 5th of July, and his Majesty entered Kyoto on\r\nthe 17th of that month. While in Hoki he issued various rescripts\r\nhaving special significance. They may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom bushi down to priests, any man who performs meritorious deeds in\r\nbattle will be duly recompensed, in addition to being confirmed in\r\nthe possession of his previously held domain, and that possession\r\nwill be continued in perpetuity to his descendants. In the case of\r\npersons killed in fight, suitable successors to their domains will be\r\nselected from their kith and kin.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Court officials and bushi down to temple priests and\r\nfunctionaries of Shinto shrines, any that come immediately to join\r\nthe Imperial forces will be rewarded, in addition to being confirmed\r\nin the tenure of their original estates.\r\n\r\nSimilar consideration will be shown to all who, though unable to come\r\nin person, supply provisions or military necessaries, submit\r\nsuggestions with loyal intent, or otherwise work in the interests of\r\nthe Imperial army. Men surrendering in battle will be pardoned for\r\ntheir previous offences, and will be rewarded for services\r\nsubsequently rendered.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the eastern outlaws (i.e. the Hojo) being sealed, their\r\ndestruction is imminent. They have slain many innocent people;\r\nplundered the property of all classes, despoiled temples, burned\r\nhouses, and conducted themselves with extreme wickedness. Unless they\r\nbe punished, public peace cannot be restored. Our army has to remove\r\nthose evils, and therefore all in its ranks, while uniting to attack\r\nthe rebels, will be careful not to inflict any suffering on the\r\npeople or to plunder them and will treat them with all benevolence.\r\nIf prisoners be common soldiers, they shall be released at once, and\r\nif officers, they shall be held in custody pending Imperial\r\ninstructions. They shall not be punished without judgment. No\r\nbuildings except the enemy's fortresses and castles shall be burned,\r\nunless the conditions of a battle dictate such a course, and it is\r\nstrictly forbidden to set fire to shrines and temples. When the\r\nImperial forces enter a city and have to be quartered in private\r\nhouses, the owners of the latter shall be duly recompensed. If these\r\ninjunctions be obeyed, the deities of heaven and earth and the\r\nancestral Kami will protect the virtuous army in its assault upon the\r\nwicked traitors.\r\n\r\nThese edicts make it clear that in one most important respect,\r\nnamely, the terms of land tenure, there was no idea of reverting to\r\nthe old-time system which recognized the right of property to be\r\nvested in the Throne and limited the period of occupation to the\r\nsovereign's will.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nWhen Go-Daigo entered Kyoto on the 17th of July, 1333, it was\r\nsuggested by some of his advisers that a ceremony of coronation\r\nshould be again held. But the sa-daijin, Nijo Michihira, opposed that\r\ncourse. He argued that although his Majesty had not resided in the\r\ncapital for some time, the sacred insignia had been always in his\r\npossession, and that his re-entering the capital should be treated as\r\nreturning from a journey. This counsel was adopted. It involved the\r\nexclusion of Kogon from the roll of sovereigns, though the title of\r\n\"retired Emperor\" was accorded to him.\r\n\r\nThere were thus three ex-Emperors at the same time. Go-Daigo assigned\r\nthe Chokodo estates for their support, retaining for himself only the\r\nprovincial taxes of Harima. The Bakufu no longer having any official\r\nexistence, the machinery of the Government in Kyoto was organized on\r\nthe hypothesis of genuine administrative efficiency. There was no\r\nchancellor (dajo daijiri) or any regent (kwampaku). These were\r\ndispensed with, in deference to the \"Restoration\" theory, namely,\r\nthat the Emperor himself should rule, as he had done in the eras of\r\nEngi and Tenryaku (901-957). But for the rest, the old offices were\r\nresuscitated and filled with men who had deserved well in the recent\r\ncrisis or who possessed hereditary claims. Prince Morinaga, the\r\nsometime lord-abbot of Hiei-zan, was nominated commander-in-chief\r\n(tai-shoguri), and for the sake of historical lucidity hereafter the\r\nfollowing appointments should be noted:\r\n\r\nPrince Narinaga to be governor-general (kwanryo) of the Kwanto, with\r\nhis headquarters at Kamakura, and with Ashikaga Tadayoshi (brother of\r\nTakauji) for second in command.\r\n\r\nPrince Yoshinaga to be governor-general of O-U (Mutsu and Dewa),\r\nassisted by Kitabatake Chikafusa (an able statesman and a historian),\r\nand the latter's son, Akiiye, as well as by the renowned warrior,\r\nYuki Munehiro.\r\n\r\nNijo Michihira to be sa-daijin.\r\n\r\nKuga Nagamichi to be u-daijin.\r\n\r\nDoin Kinkata to be nai-daijin.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the occupants of all these great offices were\r\nCourt nobles. The creed of the Kemmu era was that the usurping buke\r\n(military families) had been crushed and that the kuge (Court\r\nnobility) had come to their own again. As for the provinces, the main\r\npurpose kept in view by the new Government was to efface the traces\r\nof the shugo system. Apparently the simplest method of achieving that\r\nend would have been to appoint civilian governors (kokushi)\r\neverywhere. But in many cases civilian governors would have been\r\npowerless in the face of the conditions that had arisen under\r\nmilitary rule, and thus the newly nominated governors included\r\n\r\nAshikaga Takauji, governor of Musashi, Hitachi, and Shimosa.\r\n\r\nAshikaga Tadayoshi (brother of Takauji), governor of Totomi.\r\n\r\nKusunoki Masashige, governor of Settsu, Kawachi, and Izumi.\r\n\r\nNawa Nagatoshi, governor of Inaba and Hoki.\r\n\r\nNitta Yoshisada, governor of Kotsuke and Harima.\r\n\r\nNitta Yoshiaki (son of Yoshisada), governor of Echigo.\r\n\r\nWakiya Yoshisuke (brother of Yoshisada), governor of Suruga.\r\n\r\nOne name left out of this list was that of Akamatsu Norimura, who had\r\ntaken the leading part in driving the Hojo from Rokuhara, and who had\r\nbeen faithful to the Imperial cause throughout. He now became as\r\nimplacable an enemy as he had previously been a loyal friend. The\r\nfact is significant. Money as money was despised by the bushi of the\r\nKamakura epoch. He was educated to despise it, and his nature\r\nprepared him to receive such education. But of power he was supremely\r\nambitious--power represented by a formidable army of fully equipped\r\nfollowers, by fortified castles, and by widely recognized authority.\r\nThe prime essential of all these things was an ample landed estate To\r\ncommand the allegiance of the great military families without placing\r\nthem under an obligation by the grant of extensive manors would have\r\nbeen futile. On the other hand, to grant such manors in perpetuity\r\nmeant the creation of practically independent feudal chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the restored Government of Go-Daigo was that it\r\nhalted between these two alternatives. Appreciating that its return\r\nto power had been due to the efforts of certain military magnates, it\r\nrewarded these in a measure; but imagining that its own\r\nadministrative authority had been replaced on the ancient basis, it\r\nallowed itself to be guided, at the same time, by capricious\r\nfavouritism. Even in recognizing the services of the military\r\nleaders, justice was not observed. The records clearly show that on\r\nthe roll of merit the first place, after Prince Morinaga, should have\r\nbeen given to Kusunoki Masashige's name. When Kasagi fell and when\r\nthe Emperor was exiled, Masashige, alone among the feudatories of\r\nsixty provinces, continued to fight stoutly at the head of a small\r\nforce, thus setting an example of steadfast loyalty which ultimately\r\nproduced many imitators. Nitta Yoshisada ought to have stood next in\r\norder; then Akamatsu Norimura; then Nawa Nagatoshi, and finally\r\nAshikaga Takauji.* In the case of Takauji, there was comparatively\r\nlittle merit. He had taken up arms against the Imperial cause at the\r\noutset, and even in the assault on Rokuhara he had been of little\r\nservice. Yet to him the Crown allotted the greatest honour and the\r\nrichest rewards. Some excuse may be found in Takauji's lineage, but\r\nin that respect he was inferior to Nitta Yoshisada.\r\n\r\n*Arai Hakuseki (1656-1725).\r\n\r\nStill more flagrant partiality was displayed in other directions.\r\nRelying on the promises of the Funanoe edicts epitomized above,\r\nthousands of military officers thronged the Court in Kyoto,\r\nclamouring for recognition of their services. Judges were appointed\r\nto examine their pleas, but that proved a tedious task, and in the\r\nmeanwhile all the best lands had been given away by favour or\r\naffection. Go-Daigo himself appropriated the manors of Hojo Takatoki;\r\nthose of Hojo Yasuie were assigned to Prince Morinaga; those\r\nof Osaragi Sadanao went to the Imperial consort, Renko. The\r\nimmediate attendants of the sovereign, priests, nuns, musicians,\r\nlittérateurs--all obtained broad acres by the Imperial fiat, and\r\nwhen, in the tardy sequel of judicial procedure, awards were made to\r\nmilitary men, no spoil remained to be divided. Soon a cry went up,\r\nand gained constantly in volume and vehemence, a cry for the\r\nrestoration of the military regime. As for Go-Daigo, whatever ability\r\nhe had shown in misfortune seemed to desert him in prosperity. He\r\nneglected his administrative duties, became luxurious and arrogant,\r\nand fell more and more under the influence of the lady Ren. Of\r\nFujiwara lineage, this lady had shared the Emperor's exile and\r\nassisted his escape from Oki. It had long been her ambition to have\r\nher son, Tsunenaga, nominated Crown Prince, but as Prince Morinaga\r\nwas older and had established a paramount title by his merits, his\r\nremoval must precede the accomplishment of her purpose. Fate\r\nfurnished a powerful ally. Prince Morinaga, detecting that Ashikaga\r\nTakauji concealed a treacherous purpose under a smooth demeanour,\r\nsolicited the Emperor's mandate to deal with him. Go-Daigo refused,\r\nand thereafter the lady Ren and the Ashikaga chief, whose influence\r\nincreased daily, entered into a league for the overthrow of Prince\r\nMorinaga.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, when symptoms of disorder were growing more and\r\nmore apparent, that Fujiwara Fujifusa, a high dignitary of the Court\r\nand one of the great statesmen of his era, addressed a solemn warning\r\nto Go-Daigo. The immediate occasion was curious. There had been\r\npresented to the Court by the governor of Izumo a horse of\r\nextraordinary endurance, capable of travelling from Tomita, in that\r\nprovince, to Kyoto, a distance of one hundred and sixty miles,\r\nbetween dawn and darkness. The courtiers welcomed the appearance of\r\nthis horse as an omen of peace and prosperity, but Fujiwara Fujifusa\r\ninterpreted it as indicating that occasion to solicit speedy aid from\r\nremote provinces would soon arise. He plainly told the Emperor that\r\nthe officials were steeped in debauchery; that whereas, in the early\r\ndays of the restoration, the palace gates had been thronged with\r\nwarriors, to-day none could be seen, thousands upon thousands having\r\nleft the capital disgusted and indignant to see Court favourites\r\nenriched with the rewards which should have fallen to the military;\r\nthat the already distressed people were subjected to further heavy\r\nexactions for building or beautifying Imperial palaces; that grave\r\ninjustice had been done to Akamatsu Norimura, and that unless the\r\nsovereign refrained from self-indulgence and sought to govern\r\nbenevolently, a catastrophe could not be averted. But Go-Daigo was\r\nnot moved, and finally, after repeating his admonition on several\r\noccasions, Fujifusa left the Court and took the tonsure. It says much\r\nfor the nobility of the Emperor's disposition that he commissioned\r\nNobufusa, father of Fujifusa, to seek out the persistent critic and\r\noffer him a greatly higher office if he would consent to return, and\r\nit says much for Fujifusa's sincerity that, hoping to give weight to\r\nhis counsels, he embraced the life of a recluse and was never seen in\r\npublic again.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF PRINCE MORINAGA\r\n\r\nThings now went from bad to worse in Kyoto, while in the provinces\r\nthe remnants of the Hojo's partisans began to raise their heads. The\r\never-loyal Kusunoki Masashige and Nawa Nagatoshi entered the capital\r\nto secure it against surprise; Ashikaga Takauji, ostensibly for the\r\nsame purpose, summoned large forces from the provinces, and Prince\r\nMorinaga occupied Nawa with a strong army. Takauji saw that the time\r\nhad come to remove the prince, in whom he recognized the great\r\nobstacle to the consummation of his ambitious designs. Securing the\r\nco-operation of the lady Ren by a promise that her son, Narinaga,\r\nshould be named Crown Prince and commander-in-chief (shoguri) in\r\nsuccession to Morinaga, he informed the Emperor that Prince Morinaga\r\nwas plotting Go-Daigo's deposition and the elevation of his own son\r\nto the throne. The Emperor credited the accusation, summoned the\r\nusurping Morinaga to the palace, and caused him to be arrested. This\r\nhappened in November, 1334. Morinaga vehemently declared his\r\ninnocence. In a memorial to the Throne he recounted the loyal service\r\nhe had rendered to his sovereign and father, and concluded with these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this I have unwittingly offended. I would appeal to\r\nheaven, but the sun and moon have no favour for an unfilial son. I\r\nwould bow my head and cry to the earth for help, but the mountains\r\nand the rivers do not harbour a disloyal subject. The tie between\r\nfather and son is severed, and I am cast away. I have no longer\r\nanything to hope in the world. If I may be pardoned, stripped of my\r\nrank, and permitted to enter religion, there will be no cause for\r\nregret. In my deep sorrow I cannot say more.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad this piteous appeal reached Go-Daigo, he might have relented. But\r\njust as the memorial addressed by Yoshitsune to his brother,\r\nYoritomo, was suppressed by Hiromoto, so the chamberlain to whom\r\nPrince Morinaga entrusted his protest feared to carry it to the\r\nsovereign. Before the close of the year, the prince was exiled to\r\nKamakura, and there placed in charge of Takauji's brother, Tadayoshi,\r\nwho confined him in a cave dug for the purpose. He never emerged\r\nalive. Seven months later, Tadayoshi, on the eve of evacuating\r\nKamakura before the attack of Hojo Tokiyuki, sent an emissary to\r\nassassinate Morinaga in the cave. The unfortunate prince was in his\r\ntwenty-eighth year. His name must be added to the long list of noble\r\nmen who fell victims to slander in Japan. A Japanese annalist*\r\ncontends that Morinaga owed his fate as much to his own tactlessness\r\nas to the wiles of his enemies, and claims that in accusing Takauji\r\nto the throne, the prince forgot the Emperor's helplessness against\r\nsuch a military magnate as the Ashikaga chief. However that may have\r\nbeen, subsequent events clearly justified the prince's suspicions of\r\nTakauji's disloyalty. It must also be concluded that Go-Daigo\r\ndeliberately contemplated his son's death when he placed him in\r\ncharge of Takauji's brother.\r\n\r\n*Raj Sanyo.\r\n\r\nASHIKAGA TAKAUJI OCCUPIES KAMAKURA\r\n\r\nThe course of events has been somewhat anticipated above in order to\r\nrelate the end of Prince Morinaga's career. It is necessary, now, to\r\nrevert to the incident which precipitated his fate, namely, the\r\ncapture of Kamakura by Hojo Tokiyuki. This Tokiyuki was a son of\r\nTakatoki. He escaped to Shinano province at the time of the Hojo\r\ndownfall, and being joined there by many of his family's vassals, he\r\nfound himself strong enough to take the field openly in July, 1335,\r\nand sweeping away all opposition, he entered Kamakura in August.\r\nAshikaga Takauji's brother was then in command at Kamakura. It\r\nseemed, indeed, as though the Emperor deliberately contemplated the\r\nrestoration of the old administrative machinery in the Kwanto,\r\nchanging only the personnel; for his Majesty appointed his tenth son,\r\nPrince Narinaga, a boy of ten, to be shogun at Kamakura, and placed\r\nAshikaga Tadayoshi in a position amounting, in fact though not in\r\nname, to that of regent (shikken). Probably these measures were\r\nmerely intended to placate the Kwanto. Before there had been time to\r\ntest their efficacy, the Hojo swept down on Kamakura, and Tadayoshi\r\nand the young shogun found themselves fugitives. Meanwhile, Ashikaga\r\nTakauji in Kyoto had been secretly fanning the discontent of the\r\nunrecompensed bushi, and had assured himself that a reversion to the\r\nmilitary system would be widely welcomed. He now applied for a\r\ncommission to quell the Hojo insurrection, and on the eve of setting\r\nout for that purpose, he asked to be nominated shogun, which request\r\nbeing rejected, he left the capital without paying final respects to\r\nthe Throne, an omission astutely calculated to attract partisans.\r\n\r\nThe Hojo's resistance was feeble, and in a few weeks the Ashikaga\r\nbanners were waving again over Kamakura. The question of returning to\r\nKyoto had now to be considered. Takauji's brother, Tadayoshi,\r\nstrongly opposed such a step. He compared it to putting one's head\r\ninto a tiger's mouth, and in fact information had already reached\r\nKamakura in the sense that the enemies of the Ashikaga were busily\r\nslandering the victorious general. It may fairly be assumed, however,\r\nthat Takauji had never intended to return to Kyoto except as\r\ndictator. He assumed the title of shogun; established his mansion on\r\nthe site of Yoritomo's old yashiki; undertook control of the whole\r\nKwanto; confiscated manors of his enemies; recompensed meritorious\r\ndeeds liberally, and granted pardons readily. In fact, he presented\r\nto public gaze precisely the figure he desired to present, the strong\r\nruler who would unravel the perplexities of a distraught age. From\r\nall quarters the malcontent bushi flocked to his flag.\r\n\r\nTAKAUJI AND YOSHISADA\r\n\r\nA serious obstacle to the achievement of the Ashikaga chief's purpose\r\nwas Nitta Yoshisada. Both men were of the Minamoto family, but\r\nYoshisada's kinship was the closer and his connexion with the Hojo\r\nhad always been less intimate. Further, he had never borne arms\r\nagainst Go-Daigo's cause, as Takauji had done, and his unswerving\r\nloyalty made him an inconvenient rival. Therefore, the Ashikaga\r\nleader took an extreme step. He seized the domains of the Nitta\r\nfamily in the Kwanto and distributed them among his own followers; he\r\ncaused his brother, Tadayoshi, to send letters inviting the adherence\r\nof many bushi; he addressed to the Throne a memorial impeaching\r\nYoshisada on the ground that, whereas the latter's military successes\r\nhad been the outcome entirely of opportunities furnished by the\r\nprowess of the Ashikaga, he did not hesitate to slander Takauji to\r\nthe sovereign, and he asked for an Imperial commission to destroy the\r\nNitta leader, whom he dubbed a \"national thief.\"\r\n\r\nYoshisada, when he learned of the presentation of this memorial,\r\nseized the Ashikaga manors within his jurisdiction and addressed to\r\nthe Throne a countermemorial in which he conclusively proved the\r\nfalsehood of Takauji's assertion with reference to military affairs;\r\ncharged him with usurping the titles of governor-general of the\r\nKwanto, and shogun; declared that Prince Morinaga, the mainstay of\r\nthe restoration, had become the victim of Takauji's slanders, and\r\nasked for an Imperial mandate to punish Takauji and his brother,\r\nTadayoshi. It is significant that the leal and gallant Yoshisada did\r\nnot hesitate thus openly to assert the innocence and merits of Prince\r\nMorinaga, though only a few months had elapsed since the Emperor\r\nhimself had credited his most unhappy son's guilt. While Go-Daigo\r\nhesitated, news from various provinces disclosed the fact that\r\nTakauji had been tampering with the bushi in his own interests. This\r\nsettled the question. Takauji and Tadayoshi were proclaimed rebels,\r\nand to Nitta Yoshisada was entrusted the task of chastising them\r\nunder the nominal leadership of Prince Takanaga, the Emperor's second\r\nson, to whom the title of shogun was granted.\r\n\r\nTAKAUJI ENTERS KYOTO\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of November, 1335, the Imperial force moved\r\neastward. It was divided into two armies. One, under Yoshisada's\r\ndirect orders, marched by the Tokaido, or eastern littoral road; the\r\nother, under Yoshisada's brother, Wakiya Yoshisuke, with Prince\r\nTakanaga for titular general, advanced along the Nakasen-do, or\r\ninland mountain-road. The littoral army, carrying everything before\r\nit, pushed on to the capital of Izu, and had it forced its attack\r\nhome at once, might have captured Kamakura. But the Nitta chief\r\ndecided to await the arrival of the Nakasen-do army, and the respite\r\nthus afforded enabled the Ashikaga forces to rally. Tadayoshi reached\r\nthe Hakone Pass and posted his troops on its western slopes in a\r\nposition of immense natural vantage, while Takauji himself occupied\r\nthe routes on the north, his van being at Takenoshita.\r\n\r\nThe Imperialists attacked both positions simultaneously. Takauji not\r\nonly held his ground, but also, being joined by a large contingent of\r\nthe Kyoto men who, under the leadership of Enya Takasada, had\r\ndeserted in the thick of the fight, he shattered his opponents, and\r\nwhen this news reached Hakone on the following morning, a panic\r\nseized Yoshisada's troops so that they either fled or surrendered.\r\nThe Nitta chieftain himself retired rapidly to Kyoto with a mere\r\nremnant of his army, and effected a union with the forces of the\r\never-loyal Kusunoki Masashige and Nawa Nagatoshi, who had given\r\nasylum to Go-Daigo at the time of the escape from Oki. The cenobites\r\nof Hiei-zan also took the field in the Imperial cause. Meanwhile,\r\nTakauji and Tadayoshi, utilizing their victories, pushed rapidly\r\ntowards Kyoto. The heart of the samurai was with them, and they\r\nconstantly received large accessions of strength. Fierce fighting now\r\ntook place on the south and east of the capital. It lasted for\r\nseveral days and, though the advantage was with the Ashikaga, their\r\nvictory was not decisive.\r\n\r\nAn unlooked-for event turned the scale. It has been related above\r\nthat, in the struggle which ended in the restoration of Go-Daigo,\r\nAkamatsu Norimura was chiefly instrumental in driving the Hojo from\r\nRokuhara; and it has also been related that, in the subsequent\r\ndistribution of rewards, his name was omitted for the slight reason\r\nthat he had, at one period, entered religion. He now moved up from\r\nHarima at the head of a strong force and, attacking from the south,\r\neffected an entry into Kyoto, just as he had done three years\r\npreviously. Go-Daigo fled to Hiei, carrying the sacred insignia with\r\nhim, and on the 24th of February, 1336, the Ashikaga armies marched\r\ninto the Imperial capital.\r\n\r\nTAKAUJI RETIRES TO KYUSHU\r\n\r\nAt this stage succour arrived for the Imperialists from the extreme\r\nnorth. In the arrangement of the local administration after Go-Daigo\r\nre-occupied the throne, the two northern provinces of Mutsu and Dewa\r\nhad been separated from the Kwanto and placed under the control of\r\nPrince Yoshinaga, with Kitabatake Akiiye for lieutenant. The latter,\r\na son of the renowned Chikafusa, was in his nineteenth year when the\r\nAshikaga revolted. He quickly organized a powerful army with the\r\nintention of joining Yoshisada's attack upon Kamakura, but not being\r\nin time to carry out that programme, he changed the direction of his\r\nmarch and hastened towards Kyoto. He arrived there when the Ashikaga\r\ntroops were laying siege to Hiei-zan, and effecting a union with the\r\nImperialists, he succeeded in raising the siege and recovering the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow in detail the vicissitudes that ensued.\r\nStratagems were frequent. At one time we find a number of Yoshisada's\r\nmen, officers and privates alike, disguising themselves, mingling\r\nwith the Ashikaga army, and turning their arms against the latter at\r\na critical moment. At another, Kusunoki Masashige spreads a rumour of\r\nYoshisada's death in battle, and having thus induced Takauji to\r\ndetach large forces in pursuit of the deceased's troops, falls on\r\nhim, and drives him to Hyogo, where, after a heavy defeat, he has to\r\nflee to Bingo. Now, for a second time, the Ashikaga cause seemed\r\nhopeless when Akamatsu Norimura again played a most important role.\r\nHe provided an asylum for Takauji and Tadayoshi; counselled them to\r\ngo to the west for the purpose of mustering and equipping their\r\nnumerous partisans; advised them to obtain secretly a mandate from\r\nthe senior branch of the Imperial family so that they too, as well as\r\ntheir opponents, might be entitled to fly the brocade banner, and\r\nhaving furnished them with means to effect their escape, returned to\r\nHarima and occupied the fortress of Shirahata with the object of\r\nchecking pursuit. At this point there is a break in the unrelenting\r\ncontinuity of the operations. It should obviously have been the aim\r\nof the Imperialists to strike a conclusive blow before the Ashikaga\r\nleaders had time to assemble and organize their multitudinous\r\nsupporters in Shikoku, Kyushu, and the provinces on the north of the\r\nInland Sea. This must have been fully apparent to Kusunoki Masashige,\r\nan able strategist. Yet a delay of some weeks occurred.\r\n\r\nA quasi-historical record, the Taiheiki, ascribes this to Yoshinaga's\r\ninfatuated reluctance to quit the company of a Court beauty whom the\r\nEmperor had bestowed on him. Probably the truth is that the\r\nImperialists were seriously in want of rest and that Yoshisada fell\r\nill with fever. Something must also be attributed to a clever ruse on\r\nthe part of Akamatsu Norimura. He sent to Yoshisada's headquarters a\r\nmessage promising to give his support to the Imperialists if he was\r\nappointed high constable of Harima. Ten days were needed to obtain\r\nthe commission from Kyoto, and Norimura utilized the interval to\r\nplace the defenses of Shirahata fortress in a thoroughly secure\r\ncondition. Thus, when his patent of high constable arrived, he\r\nrejected it with disdain, saying that he had already received a\r\npatent from the shogun, Takauji, and was in no need of an Imperial\r\ngrant which \"could be altered as easily as turning one's hand.\"\r\n\r\nYoshisada, enraged at having been duped, laid siege to Shirahata but\r\nfound it almost invulnerable. It was on March 11, 1336, that Takauji\r\nwent westward from Bingo; it was on the 2nd of April that Yoshisada\r\ninvested Shirahata, and it was on the 3rd of July that the siege was\r\nraised. The Ashikaga brothers had enjoyed a respite of more than\r\nthree months, and had utilized it vigorously. They were at the\r\nDazai-fu in Chikuzen in June when a message reached them that\r\nShirahata could not hold out much longer. Immediately they set their\r\nforces in motion, advancing by land and water with an army said to\r\nhave numbered twenty thousand and a fleet of transports and war-junks\r\ntotalling seven thousand. At the island, Itsukushima, they were met\r\nby a Buddhist priest, Kenshun, bearer of a mandate signed by the\r\nex-Emperor Kogon of the senior branch, and thus, in his final\r\nadvance, the Ashikaga chief was able to fly the brocade banner. In\r\nthe face of this formidable force the Imperialists fell back to\r\nHyogo--the present Kobe--and it became necessary to determine a line\r\nof strategy.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MASASHIGE\r\n\r\nGo-Daigo, in Kyoto, summoned Kusunoki Masashige to a conference. That\r\nable general spoke in definite tones. He declared it hopeless for the\r\nImperialists with their comparatively petty force of worn-out\r\nwarriors to make head against the great Ashikuga host of fresh\r\nfighters. The only wise course was to suffer the enemy to enter\r\nKyoto, and then, while the sovereign took refuge at Hiei-zan, to\r\nmuster his Majesty's partisans in the home provinces for an unceasing\r\nwar upon the Ashikaga's long line of communications--a war\r\nculminating in an attack from the front and the rear simultaneously.\r\nThus, out of temporary defeat, final victory would be wrested.\r\n\r\nAll present at the conference, with one exception, endorsed\r\nMasashige's view as that of a proved strategist. The exception was a\r\ncouncillor, Fujiwara Kiyotada. He showed himself a veritable example\r\nof \"those whom the gods wish to destroy.\" Declaring that all previous\r\nsuccesses had been achieved by divine aid, which took no count of\r\nnumerical disparity, he urged that if the sovereign quitted the\r\ncapital before his troops had struck a blow, officers and men alike\r\nwould be disheartened; and if refuge was again taken at Hiei-zan, the\r\nImperial prestige would suffer. To these light words the Emperor\r\nhearkened. Masashige uttered no remonstrance. The time for\r\ncontroversy had passed. He hastened to the camp and bid farewell to\r\nhis son, Masatsura: \"I do not think that I shall see you again in\r\nlife. If I fall to-day, the country will pass under the sway of the\r\nAshikaga. It will be for you to judge in which direction your real\r\nwelfare lies. Do not sully your father's loyalty by forgetting the\r\nright and remembering only the expedient. So long as a single member\r\nof our family remains alive, or so much as one of our retainers, you\r\nwill defend the old castle of Kongo-zan and give your life for your\r\nnative land.\"\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THE PARTING OF KUSONOKI MASASHIGE AND HIS SON MASATSURA\r\n\r\nHe then handed to his son a sword which he himself had received from\r\nthe Emperor. Passing thence to Hyogo, Masashige joined Nitta\r\nYoshisada, and the two leaders devoted the night to a farewell\r\nbanquet. The issue of the next day's combat was a foregone\r\nconclusion. Masashige had but seven hundred men under his command. He\r\nposted this little band at Minato-gawa, near the modern Kobe, and\r\nwith desperate courage attacked the van of the Ashikaga army.\r\nGradually he was enveloped, and being wounded in ten places he, with\r\nhis brother and sixty followers, entered the precincts of a temple\r\nand died by their own hands.* Takauji and his captains, lamenting the\r\nbrave bushi's death, sent his head to his family; and history\r\nrecognizes that his example exercised an ennobling influence not only\r\non the men of his era but also on subsequent generations. After\r\nMasashige's fall a similar fate must have overtaken Yoshisada, had\r\nnot one of those sacrifices familiar on a Japanese field of battle\r\nbeen made for his sake. Oyamada Takaiye gave his horse to the Nitta\r\ngeneral and fell fighting in his stead, while Yoshisada rode away. At\r\nfirst sight these sacrifices seem to debase the saved as much as they\r\nexalt the saver. But, according to Japanese ethics, an institution\r\nwas always more precious than the person of its representative, and a\r\nprinciple than the life of its exponent. Men sacrificed themselves in\r\nbattle not so much to save the life of a commanding officer, as to\r\navert the loss his cause would suffer by his death. Parity of\r\nreasoning dictated acceptance of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n*Kusunoki Masashige is the Japanese type of a loyal and true soldier.\r\nHe was forty-three at the time of his death. Three hundred and\r\nfifty-six years later (1692), Minamoto Mitsukuni, feudal chief of\r\nMito, caused a monument to be erected to his memory at the place of\r\nhis last fight. It bore the simple epitaph \"The Tomb of Kusunoki, a\r\nloyal subject.\"\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: OSONAE (New Year Offering to Family Tutelary Deity)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PALANQUINS (Used in Old Japan Only by the Nobility)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF THE DYNASTIES\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF KYOTO BY ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nIN July, 1336, Takauji entered Kyoto and established his headquarters\r\nat the temple Higashi-dera. Go-Daigo had previously taken refuge at\r\nthe Hiei-zan monastery, the ex-Emperors, Hanazono and Kogon,\r\nremaining in the capital where they looked for the restoration of\r\ntheir branch of the Imperial family. The Ashikaga leader lost no time\r\nin despatching a force to attack Hiei-zan, but the Imperialists,\r\nsupported by the cenobites, resisted stoutly, and no impression was\r\nmade on the defences for a considerable time. In one of the\r\nengagements, however, Nawa Nagatoshi, who had harboured Go-Daigo\r\nafter the flight from Oki, met his death, and the Imperialist forces\r\ngradually dwindled. Towards the close of August, Takauji caused\r\nPrince Yutahito (or Toyohito, according to gome authorities), younger\r\nbrother of Kogon, to be proclaimed Emperor, and he is known as Komyo.\r\nCharacteristic of the people's political ignorance at that time is\r\nthe fact that men spoke of the prince's good fortune since, without\r\nany special merit of his own, he had been granted the rank of\r\nsovereign by the shogun.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the investment of the Hiei monastery made little progress,\r\nand Takauji had recourse to treachery. At the close of October he\r\nopened secret communications with Go-Daigo; assured him that the\r\nAshikaga did not entertain any disloyal purpose; declared that their\r\nseemingly hostile attitude had been inspired by the enmity of the\r\nNitta brothers; begged Go-Daigo to return to Kyoto, and promised not\r\nonly that should all ideas of revenge be foregone, but also that the\r\nadministration should be handed over to the Court, and all their\r\nranks and estates restored to the Emperor's followers.\r\n\r\nGo-Daigo ought surely to have distrusted these professions. He must\r\nhave learned from Takauji's original impeachment of Yoshisada how\r\nunscrupulous the Ashikaga leader could be on occasion, and he should\r\nhave well understood the impossibility of peace between these two\r\nmen. Yet his Majesty relied on Takauji's assurances. It was in vain\r\nthat Horiguchi Sadamitsu recounted Yoshisada's services, detailed the\r\nimmense sacrifices he had made in the Imperial cause, and declared\r\nthat if the Emperor were determined to place himself in Takauji's\r\nhands, he should prepare his departure from Hiei-zan by summoning to\r\nhis presence Yoshisada with the other Nitta leaders and sentencing\r\nthem to death. Go-Daigo was not to be moved from his purpose. He gave\r\nYoshisada fair words indeed: \"I profoundly praise your loyal\r\nservices. My wish is to pacify the country by the assistance of your\r\nfamily, but heaven has not yet vouchsafed its aid. Our troops are\r\nworn out and the hour is unpropitious. Therefore, I make peace for\r\nthe moment and bide my time. Do you repair to Echizen and use your\r\nbest endeavours to promote the cause of the restoration. Lest you be\r\ncalled a rebel after my return to Kyoto, I order the Crown Prince to\r\naccompany you.\"\r\n\r\nThus Go-Daigo, truly faithful neither to the one side nor to the\r\nother, set out for the capital. That night, Yoshisada prayed at the\r\nshrine of Hiyoshi: \"Look down on my loyalty and help me to perform my\r\njourney safely so that I may raise an army to destroy the insurgents.\r\nIf that is not to be, let one of my descendants achieve my aim.\" Two\r\nhundred and six years later, there was born in Mikawa of the stock of\r\nYoshisada one of the greatest generals and altogether the greatest\r\nruler that Japan has ever produced, Minamoto Ieyasu. Heaven answered\r\nYoshisada's prayer tardily but signally.\r\n\r\nTAKAUJI'S FAITH\r\n\r\nNot one of Takauji's promises did he respect. He imprisoned Go-Daigo;\r\nhe stripped all the courtiers of their ranks and titles; he placed in\r\nconfinement all the generals and officers of the Imperial forces, and\r\nhe ordered the transfer of the insignia to the sovereign of his own\r\nnomination, Komyo. Tradition has it that Go-Daigo, victim of so many\r\ntreacheries, practised one successful deception himself: he reserved\r\nthe original of the sacred sword and seal and handed counterfeits to\r\nKomyo. This took place on November 12, 1336. Some two months later,\r\nJanuary 23, 1337, Go-Daigo, disguised as a woman for the second time\r\nin his career, fled from his place of detention through a broken\r\nfence, and reached Yoshino in Yamato, where he was received by\r\nMasatsura, son of Kusunoki Masashige, and by Kitabatake Chikafusa.\r\n\r\nYoshino now became the rendez-vous of Imperialists from the home\r\nprovinces, and Go-Daigo sent a rescript to Yoshisada in Echizen,\r\nauthorizing him to work for the restoration.\r\n\r\nThus commenced the War of the Dynasties, known in history as the\r\nConflict of the Northern and Southern Courts, terms borrowed from the\r\nfact that Yoshino, where Go-Daigo had his headquarters, lay to the\r\nsouth of Kyoto. Hereafter, then, the junior branch of the Imperial\r\nFamily will be designated the Southern Court and the senior branch\r\nwill be spoken of as the Northern Court.\r\n\r\nThe struggle lasted from 1337 to 1392, a period of fifty-five years.\r\nMuch has been written and said about the relative legitimacy of the\r\ntwo Courts. It does not appear that there is any substantial material\r\nfor doubt. Go-Daigo never abdicated voluntarily, or ever surrendered\r\nthe regalia. Before his time many occupants of the throne had stepped\r\ndown at the suggestion of a Fujiwara or a Hojo. But always the\r\nsemblance of free-will had been preserved. Moreover, the transfer of\r\nthe true regalia constituted the very essence of legitimate\r\nsuccession. But these remained always in Go-Daigo's possession.\r\nTherefore, although in the matter of lineage no distinction could be\r\njustly set up between the Northern and the Southern Courts, the\r\ncollaterals of legitimacy were all with the latter.\r\n\r\nOf course each complied with all the forms of Imperialism. Thus,\r\nwhereas the Southern Court used the year-name Engen for 1336-1339,\r\nthe North kept the year-name Kemmu for two years, and as there were\r\ndifferent nengo names for half a century, a new element of confusion\r\nwas added to the already perplexing chronology of Japan. In\r\nadministrative methods there was a difference. The Northern Court\r\nadhered to the camera system: that is to say, the actual occupant of\r\nthe throne was a mere figurehead, the practical functions of\r\nGovernment being discharged by the cloistered sovereign. In the\r\nSouthern Court the Emperor himself, nominally at all events, directed\r\nthe business of administration. Further, the office of shogun in the\r\nSouthern Court was held generally by an Imperial Prince, whereas in\r\nthe Northern Court its holder was an Ashikaga. In brief, the\r\nsupporters of the Northern Court followed the military polity of the\r\nBakufu while the Southern adopted Imperialism.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nAs the question at issue lay solely between two claimants to the\r\nsuccession, readers of history naturally expect to find the war\r\nresolve itself into a campaign, or a succession of campaigns, between\r\ntwo armies. Such was by no means the case. Virtually the whole empire\r\nwas drawn into the turmoil, and independent fighting went on at\r\nseveral places simultaneously. The two Courts perpetually made Kyoto\r\ntheir objective. Regardless of its strategical disadvantages, they\r\ndeemed its possession cardinal. Takauji had been more highly lauded\r\nand more generously rewarded than Yoshisada, because the former had\r\nrecovered Kyoto whereas the latter had only destroyed Kamakura. Thus,\r\nwhile Go-Daigo constantly struggled to capture Kyoto, Komyo's\r\nabsorbing aim was to retain it. This obsession in favour of the\r\nImperial metropolis left its mark upon many campaigns; as when, in\r\nthe spring operations of 1336, Yoshisada, instead of being allowed to\r\npursue and annihilate Takauji, was recalled to guard Kyoto, and when,\r\nin July of the same year, Kusunoki Masashige was sent to his death\r\nrather than temporarily vacate the capital. It must have been fully\r\napparent to the great captains of the fourteenth century that Kyoto\r\nwas easy to take and hard to hold. Lake Biwa and the river Yodo are\r\nnatural bulwarks of Yamato, not of Yamashiro. Hiei-zan looks down on\r\nthe lake, and Kyoto lies on the great plain at the foot of the hill.\r\nIf, during thirteen generations, the Ashikaga family struggled for\r\nKyoto, they maintained, the while, their ultimate base and\r\nrallying-place at Kamakura, and thus, even when shattered in the\r\nwest, they could recuperate in the east. The Southern Court had no\r\nsuch depot and recruiting-ground. They had, indeed, a tolerable place\r\nof arms in the province of Kawachi, but in the end they succumbed to\r\ntopographical disadvantages.\r\n\r\nDEATHS OF YOSHISADA AND AKIIYE\r\n\r\nIn the fact that he possessed a number of sons, Go-Daigo had an\r\nadvantage over his fourteen-year-old rival, Komyo, for these Imperial\r\nprinces were sent out to various districts to stimulate the loyal\r\nefforts of local bushi. With Yoshisada to Echizen went the Crown\r\nPrince and his brother Takanaga. They entrenched themselves at\r\nKana-ga-saki, on the seacoast, whence Yoshisada's eldest son,\r\nYoshiaki, was despatched to Echigo to collect troops, and a younger\r\nbrother, Yoshisuke, to Soma-yama on a similar errand. Almost\r\nimmediately, Ashikaga Takatsune with an army of twenty thousand men\r\nlaid siege to Kanaga-saki. But Yoshiaki and Yoshisuke turned in their\r\ntracks and delivered a rear attack which scattered the besiegers.\r\nThis success, however, proved only temporary. The Ashikaga leader's\r\ndeep resentment against Yoshisada inspired a supreme effort to crush\r\nhim, and the Kana-ga-saki fortress was soon invested by an\r\noverwhelming force on sea and on shore. Famine necessitated\r\nsurrender. Yoshiaki and Prince Takanaga committed suicide, the latter\r\nfollowing the former's example and using his blood-stained sword. The\r\nCrown Prince was made prisoner and subsequently poisoned by Takauji's\r\norders. Yoshisada and his brother Yoshisuke escaped to Soma-yama and\r\nrallied their partisans to the number of three thousand.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Kana-ga-saki occurred in April, 1338, and, two months\r\nlater, Go-Daigo took the very exceptional course of sending an\r\nautograph letter to Yoshisada. The events which prompted his Majesty\r\nwere of prime moment to the cause of the Southern Court. Kitabatake\r\nAkiiye, the youthful governor of Mutsu and son of the celebrated\r\nChikafusa, marched southward at the close of 1337, his daring project\r\nbeing the capture, first, of Kamakura, and next, of Kyoto The nature\r\nof this gallant enterprise may be appreciated by observing that Mutsu\r\nlies at the extreme north of the main island, is distant some five\r\nhundred miles from Kyoto, and is separated from the latter by several\r\nregions hostile to the cause which Akiiye represented. Nevertheless,\r\nthe brilliant captain, then in his twenty-first year, seized Kamakura\r\nin January, 1338, and marched thence in February for Yoshino. He\r\ngained three victories on the way, and had nearly reached his\r\nobjective when, at Ishizu, he encountered a great army of Ashikaga\r\ntroops under an able leader, Ko no Moronao, and after a fierce\r\nengagement the Southern forces were shattered, Akiiye himself falling\r\nin the fight. This disaster occurred on June 11, 1338. A brave rally\r\nwas made by Akiiye's younger brother, Akinobu. He gathered the\r\nremnants of the Mutsu army and occupied Otokoyama, which commands\r\nKyoto.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage of the campaign that Go-Daigo resorted to the\r\nexceptional measure of sending an autograph letter to Yoshisada, then\r\nentrenched at Somayama, in Echizen. His Majesty conjured the Nitta\r\nleader to march to the assistance of Akinobu at Otoko-yama. Yoshisada\r\nresponded at once. He despatched his brother, Yoshisuke, with twenty\r\nthousand men, remaining himself to cover the rear of the expedition.\r\nBut Otoko-yama surrendered before this succour reached it, and the\r\nNitta brothers then combined their forces to operate against the\r\nAshikaga. Nothing decisive resulted, and in September, 1338,\r\nYoshisada fell in an insignificant combat near the fortress of\r\nFujishima in Echizen. He caused a comrade to behead him and carry off\r\nthe head, but the enemy identified him by means of the Imperial\r\nletter found on his person.\r\n\r\nYoshisada was only thirty-eight at the time of his death (September,\r\n1338). Rai Sanyo (1780-1832), the great Japanese historian, says: \"I\r\nsaw a letter written by Yoshisada with his own hand for the purpose\r\nof admonishing the members of his family. In it he wrote: 'An officer\r\nin command of an army should respect the sovereign; treat his\r\nsubordinates with clemency but decision; leave his fate in heaven's\r\nhands, and not blame others.' Yoshisada is open to criticism for not\r\npursuing the Ashikaga when they fled westward from Kyoto; yet it must\r\nbe remembered that he had no firm base, being hurried from one\r\nquarter to another. The strategy he used was not his own free choice\r\nnor were the battles he fought contrived by himself. But his devotion\r\nto the Imperial cause, his unfailing loyalty, and his indifference to\r\nself-interest have kept his memory fresh and will always keep it\r\nfresh. If, two hundred years after his death, a chieftain was born of\r\nhis blood to carry the Minamoto name to the pinnacle of glory, who\r\nshall say that heaven did not thus answer the prayer put up by\r\nYoshisada at the shrine of Hiyoshi?\"\r\n\r\nDEATH OF GO-DAIGO\r\n\r\nDuring these events, Go-Daigo sojourned at Yoshino, which was\r\nprotected by Kusunoki Masatsura, Wada Masatomo, and others. At the\r\nclose of August, 1339, his Majesty falling ill, and feeling that his\r\nend was near, resigned the throne to his twelve-year-old son, the\r\nCrown Prince Yoshinaga, whose historical name is Go-Murakami.\r\nGo-Daigo's will declared that his only regret in leaving the world\r\nwas his failure to effect the restoration, and that though his body\r\nwas buried at Yoshino, his spirit would always yearn for Kyoto.\r\nTradition says that he expired holding a sword in his right hand, the\r\nHokke-kyo-sutra in his left, and that Kitabatake Chikafusa spoke of\r\nthe event as a dream within a dream.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded to Ashikaga Takauji's credit that, when the news\r\nreached Kyoto, he ordered five days' mourning; that he himself\r\nundertook to transcribe a sacred volume by way of supplication for\r\nthe repose of Go-Daigo's spirit, and that he caused a temple to be\r\nbuilt for the same purpose. Of course, these events cast a cloud over\r\nthe fortunes of the Southern Court, but its adherents did not abate\r\ntheir activities. Everywhere they mustered in greater or less force.\r\nThe clearest conception of their strength may be obtained by\r\ntabulating the names of their families and of the latter's\r\nlocalities:\r\n\r\n   FAMILIES                             PROVINCES\r\n\r\n   Kitabatake                           Mutsu and Ise\r\n\r\n   Nitta                                Musashi, Shimotsuke, Echizen\r\n\r\n   Kusunoki                             Kawachi\r\n\r\n   Kojima, Sakurayama, Arii, Yoshikawa  Sanyo-do\r\n\r\n   Nawa and Misumi                      Sanin-do\r\n\r\n   Kikuchi, Matsura, Kusano             Saikai-do\r\n\r\n   Doi, Tokuno, Yuasa, Yamamoto         Nankai-do\r\n\r\n   Ii                                   Totomi\r\n\r\n   Neo                                  Mino\r\n\r\n   Shinto officials                     Atsuta\r\n\r\nThis table suggests that partisans of the Southern Court existed in\r\nalmost every part of the empire. So, in truth, they did. But friends\r\nof the Northern Court existed also, and thus it resulted that at no\r\ntime throughout the fifty-five years of the struggle were the\r\nprovinces free from strife. It resulted also that frequent changes of\r\nallegiance took place, for a family had often to choose between total\r\nruin, on the one hand, and comparative prosperity at the sacrifice of\r\nconstancy, on the other. Some historians have adduced the incidents\r\nof this era as illustrating the shallowness of Japanese loyalty. But\r\nit can scarcely be said that loyalty was ever seriously at stake. In\r\npoint of legitimacy there was nothing to choose between the rival\r\nbranches of the Imperial family. A samurai might-pass from the\r\nservice of the one to that of the other without doing any violence to\r\nhis reverence for the Throne.\r\n\r\nWhat was certainly born of the troubled era, however, was a sentiment\r\nof contempt for central authority and a disposition to rely on one's\r\nown right arm. It could not have been otherwise. In several provinces\r\nofficial nominees of both Courts administered simultaneously, and men\r\nwere requisitioned for aid, to-day, to the Northern cause, to-morrow,\r\nto the Southern. To be strong enough to resist one or the other was\r\nthe only way to avoid ruinous exactions. From that to asserting one's\r\nstrength at the expense of a neighbour who followed a different flag\r\nwas a short step, if not a duty, and thus purely selfish\r\nconsiderations dictated a fierce quarrel and inspired many an act of\r\nunscrupulous spoliation. A few cases are on record of families which\r\nresorted to the device of dividing themselves into two branches, each\r\ndeclaring for a different cause and each warring nominally with the\r\nother. Thus the sept as a whole preserved its possessions, in part at\r\nany rate, whichever Court triumphed. But such double-faced schemes\r\nwere very rare. A much commoner outcome of the situation was the\r\ngrowth of powerful families which regulated their affairs by means of\r\na council of leading members without reference to Kamakura, Kyoto, or\r\nYoshino. At the same time, minor septs in the neighbourhood saw the\r\nadvantage of subscribing to the decisions of these councils and\r\ndeferring to their judgments.\r\n\r\n\"This was an important step in the development of the feudal system.\r\nAnother was the abolition of feudal fiefs, as well as of the\r\nsuccession of women to real estate, and a curtailment of the\r\ninheritance, not so much of younger sons, as of all sons except the\r\none selected as lord of the clan.\"* The shugo (high constables) also\r\nbecame a salient element of feudalism. Originally liable to frequent\r\ntransfers of locality, some of them subsequently came to hold their\r\noffice hereditarily, and these, together with the great majority of\r\ntheir confreres who had been appointed by the Bakufu, espoused the\r\nAshikaga cause; a choice which impelled many of the military families\r\nin their jurisdiction to declare for the Southern Court. The Ashikaga\r\nshugo ultimately became leading magnates, for they wielded twofold\r\nauthority, namely, that derived from their power as owners of broad\r\nestates, and that derived from their commission as shogun's delegates\r\nentitled to levy taxes locally. The provincial governors, at the\r\noutset purely civil officials, occasionally developed military\r\ncapacity and rivalled the hereditary shugo in armed influence, but\r\nsuch instances were rare.\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE COURSE OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Kusunoki Masashige, of Nitta Yoshisada, and of\r\nKitabatake Akiiye, the strategical direction of the war devolved\r\nmainly upon Kitabatake Chikafusa, so far as the Southern Court was\r\nconcerned. The greater part of the nation may be said to have been in\r\narms, but only a small section took actual part in the main campaign,\r\nthe troops in the distant provinces being occupied with local\r\nstruggles. Chikafusa's general plan was to menace Kyoto and Kamakura\r\nsimultaneously. Just as the eight provinces of the Kwanto formed the\r\nbase of the Ashikaga armies, so the eight provinces constituting the\r\nKii peninsula--Yamato, Kawachi, Izumi, Ise, Iga, Shima, Kii (in\r\npart), and Omi (in part)--served as bases for the partisans of the\r\nSouth. To strike at Kyoto from this base required the previous\r\nsubjugation of Settsu, and, on the other hand, a strong army in\r\nSettsu menaced Yoshino.\r\n\r\nChikafusa's plan, then, was to marshal in Kawachi force sufficient to\r\nthreaten, if not to overrun, Settsu, and then to push on into the\r\nmetropolitan province from Omi and Iga, the Ashikaga having been\r\npreviously induced to uncover Kyoto by the necessity of guarding\r\nKamakura. From the Kii peninsula the obvious route to the Kwanto is\r\nby sea. Therefore, the Southerners established a naval base at\r\nShingu, on the east coast of the peninsula, and used it for the\r\npurpose not only of despatching a force northward, but also of\r\nmaintaining communications with Shikoku and Kyushu, where they had\r\nmany partisans. Chikafusa himself led the oversea expedition to the\r\nKwanto, but the flotilla was wrecked by a storm, and he reached Yedo\r\nBay with only a small following. Nevertheless, he established himself\r\nat Oda, in Hitachi, and being there joined by many of the Ashikaga's\r\nenemies, he managed, not indeed to seriously menace Kamakura, but at\r\nall events to give occupation to a large force of the Northerners.\r\nDriven out at last (1343), after more than four years' operations, he\r\nreturned to Yoshino, where he found Kusunoki Masatsura, son of\r\nMasashige, carrying on from Kawachi a vigorous campaign against the\r\nAshikaga in Settsu.\r\n\r\nAfter many minor engagements, in all of which he was successful,\r\nMasatsura inflicted such a severe defeat on his opponents at\r\nSumiyoshi that the Bakufu became alarmed, and mustering an army of\r\nsixty thousand men, sent it under Ko Moronao and his brother,\r\nMoroyasu, to attack Masatsura. This was in December, 1347. Then\r\nMasatsura and his younger brother, Masatoki, together with Wada\r\nKatahide and other bushi, to the number of 140, made oath to conquer\r\nin fight or to die. They repaired to Yoshino, and having taken leave\r\nof the Emperor, Go-Murakami, they worshipped at the shrine of the\r\nlate sovereign, Go-Daigo, inscribed their names upon the wall, and\r\nwrote under them:\r\n\r\n   We that our bows here\r\n   Swear nevermore to slacken\r\n   Till in the land of life we\r\n   Cease to be counted,\r\n   Our names now record.\r\n\r\nIt was in February, 1348, that the battle took place at Shijo-nawate\r\nin Kawachi. Moronao had sixty thousand men at his disposal; Masatsura\r\nonly three thousand. The combat raged during six hours, the Kusunoki\r\nbrothers leading thirty charges, until finally they were both covered\r\nwith wounds, and only fifty men remained out of the sworn band. Then\r\nthis remnant committed suicide. Moronao, following up his victory,\r\nmarched into Yamato, and set fire to the palace there. Go-Murakami\r\nescaped to Kanao, and presently the Nitta family in the east and the\r\nKitabatake in the west showed such activity that the Southern cause\r\nrecovered its vitality, a turn of events largely promoted by\r\ndissensions in the Northern camp and by the consequent return of\r\nMoronao's forces to Kyoto. It is necessary, therefore, to direct our\r\neyes for a moment to the course of affairs on the side of the\r\nAshikaga.\r\n\r\nTHE ASHIKAGA POLITY\r\n\r\nAshikaga Takauji's original idea was to follow the system of Yoritomo\r\nin everything. Kamakura was to be his capital and he assumed the\r\ntitle of shogun. This was in 1335. Three years later he received the\r\nshogunate in due form from the Northern sovereign, Komyo. But he now\r\ndiscovered that Kyoto must be his headquarters so long as the War of\r\nthe Dynasties lasted, and he therefore established the Bakufu at\r\nMuromachi in that city, modelling it on the lines of Yoritomo's\r\ninstitution, but dispensing with a regent (shikkeri) and substituting\r\nfor him a second shitsuji. The first two shitsuji at Muromachi were\r\nKo Moronao, the great general, and Uesugi Tomosada, a connexion of\r\nTakauji. Kamakura was not neglected, however. It became a secondary\r\nbasis, Takauji's eight-year-old son, Yoshiakira, being installed\r\nthere as governor-general (kwanryo) of the Kwanto under the\r\nguardianship of Uesugi Noriaki as shitsuji, and the old\r\nadministrative machinery of the Hojo was revived in the main.\r\nTakauji's brother, Tadayoshi, became chief of the general staff in\r\nKyoto, and \"several Kamakura literati--descendants of Oye, Nakahara,\r\nMiyoshi, and others--were brought up to fill positions on the various\r\nboards, the services of some of the ablest priests of the time being\r\nenlisted in the work of drafting laws and regulations.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nTo these priests and literati was entrusted the task of compiling a\r\ncode based on the Joei Shikimoku of the Hojo regents, and there\r\nresulted the Kemmu Shikimoku, promulgated in 1337.* This was not a\r\nlaw, properly so called, but rather a body of precepts contained in\r\nseventeen articles. They have much interest as embodying the ethics\r\nof the time in political circles. \"Economy must be universally\r\npractised. Drinking parties and wanton frolics must be suppressed.\r\nCrimes of violence and outrage must be quelled. The practice of\r\nentering the private dwellings of the people and making inquisitions\r\ninto their affairs must be given up.\" Then follow two articles\r\ndealing with the ownership of vacant plots and rebuilding of houses\r\nand fireproof godowns in the devastated sections of the capital. The\r\nsubsequent paragraphs provide that men of special ability for\r\ngovernment work should be chosen for the office of shugo; that a stop\r\nmust be put to the practice of influential nobles and women of all\r\nsorts and Buddhist ecclesiastics making interested recommendations\r\n(to the sovereign); that persons holding public posts must be liable\r\nto reprimand for negligence and idleness; that bribery must be firmly\r\nput down; that presents made from all quarters to those attached to\r\nthe palace, whether of the inside or outside service, must be sent\r\nback; that those who are to be in personal attendance on the rulers\r\nmust be selected for that duty; that ceremonial etiquette should be\r\nthe predominant principle; that men noted for probity and adherence\r\nto high principle should be rewarded by more than ordinary\r\ndistinction; that the petitions and complaints of the poor and lowly\r\nshould be heard and redress granted; that the petitions of temples\r\nand shrines should be dealt with on their merits, and that certain\r\nfixed days should be appointed for the rendering of decisions and the\r\nissue of government orders.**\r\n\r\n*Kemmu was the Northern Court's name of the year-period 1334 to 1338:\r\nsee p. 398.\r\n\r\n**The Kemmu Shikimoku by Mr. Consul-General Hall, in the\r\n\"Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan;\" epitomized by\r\nMurdoch.\r\n\r\nTHE JINNO SHOTOKI\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the history of this troubled era, it is\r\nadvisable to speak of a great political brochure which was compiled\r\nby Kitabatake Chikafusa during the period (1340-1343) of his attempt\r\nto harass the Ashikaga from the direction of Hitachi. This was a work\r\ndesigned to establish the divine claim of the sovereign of the\r\nSouthern Court. Hence the title of the treatise, Correct Genealogy\r\n(Shotoki) of the Divine Emperor (Jinno). The reader knows that when,\r\nin the eighth century, Japan went to Chinese sources for\r\njurisprudential inspiration, she had to eliminate the Confucian and\r\nMencian doctrine that the sceptre may not be wielded by anyone whose\r\nvirtues do not qualify him for the task in the eyes of the nation.\r\nThis same doctrine permeated by construction the commentaries that\r\naccompanied the articles of the Kemmu Shikimoku as quoted above, and\r\nin that fact Chikafusa saw an opportunity of winning adherents for\r\nthe Southern Court by proclaiming its heaven-conferred rights.\r\n\r\n\"Great Yamato,\" Kitabatake wrote, \"is a divine country. It is only\r\nour land whose foundations were first laid by the divine ancestor. It\r\nalone has been transmitted by the Sun goddess to a long line of her\r\ndescendants. There is nothing of this kind in foreign countries.\r\nTherefore it is called the divine land. . . It is only our country\r\nwhich from the time when the heaven and earth were first unfolded,\r\nhas preserved the succession to the throne intact in one single\r\nfamily. Even when, as sometimes naturally happened, it descended to a\r\nlateral branch, it was held according to just principles. This shows\r\nthat the oath of the gods (to preserve the succession) is ever\r\nrenewed in a way which distinguishes Japan from all other countries.\r\n. . . It is the duty of every man born on the Imperial soil to yield\r\ndevoted loyalty to his sovereign, even to the sacrifice of his own\r\nlife. Let no one suppose for a moment that there is any credit due to\r\nhim for doing so. Nevertheless, in order to stimulate the zeal of\r\nthose who came after, and in loving memory of the dead, it is the\r\nbusiness of the ruler to grant rewards in such cases (to the\r\nchildren). Those who are in an inferior position should not enter\r\ninto rivalry with them. Still more should those who have done no\r\nspecially meritorious service abstain from inordinate ambitions. I\r\nhave already touched on the principles of statesmanship. They are\r\nbased on justice and mercy, in the dispensing of which firm action is\r\nrequisite. Such is the clear instruction vouchsafed to us by the Sun\r\ngoddess.\"*\r\n\r\n*Aston's Japanese Literature.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that these doctrines produced any\r\nwide-spread influence on public opinion at the time of their\r\npromulgation. In the first place they were not generally accessible;\r\nfor not until the year 1649 was Kitabatake's brochure printed. That\r\nit remained in manuscript during three centuries after its\r\ncompilation is not attributable to technical difficulties. The art of\r\nblockprinting came to Japan from China in very early times, and it is\r\non record that, in 770, the Empress Shotoku caused a million Buddhist\r\namulets to be printed. But the Jinno Shotoki did not fall on fruitful\r\nsoil. Either its teaching was superfluous or men were too much\r\nengrossed with fighting to listen to academical disquisitions.\r\nChikafusa's work was destined to produce great and lasting effects in\r\nfuture ages, but, for the moment, it accomplished little.\r\n\r\nDISCORD IN THE CAMP OF THE ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nA prominent feature of the Ashikaga family's annals was continuity of\r\ninternecine strife. The Hojo's era had been conspicuously free from\r\nany such blemish; the Ashikaga's was markedly disfigured by it, so\r\nmuch so that by the debilitating effects of this discord the\r\nsupremacy of the sept was long deferred. The first outward\r\nindications of the trouble were seen in 1348, when the able general,\r\nKo Moronao, instead of following up his victory over the Southern\r\nCourt after the death of Kusunoki Masatsura, turned suddenly\r\nnorthward from Yamato and hastened back to Kyoto. His own safety\r\ndictated that step. For during his absence from the capital on\r\ncampaign, a plot to effect his overthrow had matured under the\r\nleadership of Ashikaga Tadayoshi and Uesugi Shigeyoshi.\r\n\r\nThe latter held the office of shitsuji, and was therefore Moronao's\r\ncomrade, while Tadayoshi, as already stated, had the title of\r\ncommander-in-chief of the general staff and virtually directed\r\nadministrative affairs, subject, of course, to Takauji's approval.\r\nMoronao undoubtedly possessed high strategical ability, and being\r\nassisted by his almost equally competent brother, Moroyasu, rendered\r\nsterling military service to the Ashikaga cause. But the two brothers\r\nwere arrogant, dissipated, and passionate. It is recorded of Moronao\r\nthat he abducted the wife of Enya Takasada, and of Moroyasu that he\r\ndesecrated the grave of Sugawara in order to enclose its site within\r\nhis mansion, both outrages being condoned by the shogun, Takauji, In\r\ntruth, even in the days of Taira overlordship, Kyoto was never so\r\ncompletely under the heel of the military as it was in early Ashikaga\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nRokuhara did not by any means arrogate such universal authority as\r\ndid Muromachi. The Court nobles in the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury had no functions except those of a ceremonial nature and were\r\nfrankly despised by the haughty bushi. It is on record that Doki\r\nYorito, meeting the cortege of the retired Emperor Kogon, pretended\r\nto mistake the escorts' cry of \"In\" (camera sovereign) for \"inu\"\r\n(dog), and actually discharged an arrow at the Imperial vehicle.\r\nYorito suffered capital punishment, but the incident illustrates the\r\ndemeanour of the military class.\r\n\r\nThe two Ko brothers were conspicuously masterful and made many\r\nenemies. But the proximate cause of the plot alluded to above was\r\njealousy on the part of Ashikaga Tadayoshi and Uesugi Shigeyoshi, who\r\nresented the trust reposed by Takauji in Moronao and Moroyasu. The\r\nconspirators underestimated Moronao's character. Reaching Kyoto by\r\nforced marches from Yamato, he laid siege to Tadayoshi's mansion, and\r\npresently Tadayoshi had to save himself by taking the tonsure, while\r\nShigeyoshi was exiled to Echizen, whither Moronao sent an assassin to\r\nmake away with him. The Ashikaga chief, whose trust in Moronao was\r\nnot at all shaken by these events, summoned from Kamakura his eldest\r\nson, Yoshiakira, and entrusted to him the functions hitherto\r\ndischarged by his uncle, Tadayoshi, replacing him in Kamakura by a\r\nyounger son, Motouji.\r\n\r\nYoshiakira was not Takauji's eldest son; he was his eldest legitimate\r\nson. An illegitimate son, four years older, had been left in Kamakura\r\nas a priest, but was recognized as the possessor of such abilities\r\nthat, although his father refused to meet him, his uncle, Tadayoshi,\r\nsummoned him to Kyoto and procured for him the high office of tandai\r\nof the west. This Tadafuyu was discharging his military duties in\r\nBingo when news reached him of Moronao's coup d'etat in Kyoto and of\r\nhis own patron, Tadayoshi's discomfiture. At once Tadafuyu crossed\r\nthe sea to Higo in Kyushu, where a large number of discontented\r\nsamurai rallied to his banner, and Shoni, the Ashikaga tandai of\r\nKyushu, soon found himself vigorously attacked. The struggle\r\npresently assumed such importance that Kyoto's attention was\r\nattracted. The normal course would have been for Moronao to take the\r\nfield against Tadafuyu. But Moronao was looking always for an\r\nopportunity to compass the death of his enemy, Tadayoshi, and\r\nthinking that his chance had now come, he persuaded Takauji to take\r\npersonal command of the expedition to Kyushu, the idea being to\r\nfinally dispose of Tadayoshi during the absence of the Ashikaga\r\nshogun from Kyoto. Tadayoshi, however, obtained timely information of\r\nthis design and escaping to Yamato, offered to surrender to the\r\nSouthern Court. This was in January, 1350.\r\n\r\nThe advisers of the Emperor Go-Murakami differed radically in their\r\ncounsels, but it was finally decided that every effort should be made\r\nto widen the rift in the Ashikaga lute, and the Court commissioned\r\nTadayoshi to attack Takauji and recover Kyoto. Thus was presented the\r\nspectacle of a father (Takauji) fighting against his son (Tadafuyu),\r\nand a brother (Tadayoshi) fighting against a brother (Takauji).\r\nTadayoshi was joined by many men of note and puissance whom the\r\narrogance of the two Ko, Moronao and Moroyasu, had offended. A\r\ndesperate struggle ensued, and the Ko generals had to retreat to\r\nHarima, where they joined with Takauji, the latter having abandoned\r\nhis expedition to Kyushu. Meanwhile, Yoshiakira, Takauji's eldest\r\nson, had escaped from Kyoto and entered his father's camp. After a\r\ntime negotiations for peace were concluded (1351), one of the\r\nconditions being that Moronao and Moroyasu should lay down their\r\noffices and enter the priesthood. But the blood of the shitsuji,\r\nUesugi Shigeyoshi, was still fresh on Moronao's hands. Shigeyoshi's\r\nson, Akiyoshi, waylaid the two Ko on their route to Kyoto to take the\r\ntonsure, and Moronao and Moroyasu were both killed.\r\n\r\nYEAR-PERIODS AND COURTS\r\n\r\nThree years before the death of Moronao, that is to say, in 1348, the\r\nsovereign of the Northern Court, Komyo, abdicated in favour of Suko.\r\nEver since 1332 there had been a dual year-period, outcome of the\r\ndivided Imperialism, and history was thus not a little complicated.\r\nIt will be convenient here to tabulate, side by side, the lines of\r\nthe two dynasties:\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN COURT                             NORTHERN COURT\r\n\r\n96th Sovereign, Go-Daigo     1318-1339     Kogon      1332-1335\r\n\r\n97th     \"      Go-Murakami  1339-1368     Komyo      1335-1348\r\n\r\n98th     \"      Chokei       1368-1372     Suko       1348-1352\r\n\r\n99th     \"      Go-Kameyama  1372-1392     Go-Kogon   1352-1371\r\n\r\n                                           Go-Enyu    1371-1382\r\n\r\n100th    \"      Go-Komatsu   1392-1412     Go-Komatsu 1382-1412\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the average duration of a Southern sovereign's\r\nreign was eighteen years, whereas that of a Northern sovereign was\r\nonly thirteen years.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF TADAYOSHI\r\n\r\nThe peace concluded between the Ashikaga chief and his brother,\r\nTadayoshi, was of brief duration; their respective partisans\r\ndistrusted one another too much. The Nikki, the Hosokawa, the Doki,\r\nand the Sasaki, all followed Takauji, but the Ishido, the Uesugi, and\r\nthe Momonoi adhered to Tadayoshi. At last the situation became so\r\nstrained that Tadayoshi withdrew to Echizen and from thence made his\r\nway to Kamakura. In these circumstances, Takauji desired to take the\r\nfield himself, but since to do so would have exposed Kyoto to danger\r\nfrom the south, he attempted to delude the Court at Yoshino into\r\ncrediting his loyalty and his willingness to dethrone Suko by way of\r\npreliminary to welcoming the return of Go-Murakami to Kyoto.\r\n\r\nTakauji's professions were now appraised at their true value,\r\nhowever. The Court at Yoshino commissioned him to punish his\r\nrebellious brother, but took steps, as will presently be seen, to\r\nturn the resulting situation to its own advantage. Takauji now placed\r\nhimself at the head of a strong army, and moving eastward, marched to\r\nKamakura practically unopposed. Tadayoshi escaped to Izu, where he\r\ntook poison, or was given it. Takauji remained in the Kwanto during\r\nthe greater part of two years (1352-1353). The task of restoring\r\norder and re-establishing the Ashikaga supremacy demanded all his\r\nability and resources. \"In the Kwanto alone, during these two years,\r\nmore battles were fought--some of considerable magnitude--than during\r\nthe thirty years between 1455 and 1485 in England.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN COURT IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs the Southern Court found its opportunity. In\r\naccepting Takauji's overtures, Kitabatake Chikafusa, who directed the\r\npolitics and strategy of the Southern Court, had designed to dethrone\r\nSuko, to adopt the year name, Shohei, solely, and to establish an\r\nadministrative council in Kyoto under his own presidency. He knew\r\nwell that Takauji's surrender had not been sincere, but he counted on\r\nan access of strength from the partisans of Tadayoshi, and he looked\r\nfor some occasion capable of being turned to advantage. Yoshiakira,\r\nwho ruled Kyoto in the absence of his father, Takauji, made no\r\ndifficulty about dethroning Suko and requesting the return of the\r\nSouthern sovereign, Go-Murakami. Neither did he hesitate to hand over\r\nthe false insignia which had been given by Go-Daigo to the Northern\r\nCourt. In February, 1352, Go-Murakami paid a visit to Otoko-yama on\r\nthe southeast of Kyoto, and ordered a number of officials, under\r\nKitabatake Chikafusa and Kusunoki Masanori, to enter the capital and\r\nconduct affairs. But his Majesty did not trust his own person into\r\nthe city. He waited until his plans were mature, and then a strong\r\nforce of Southern troops was launched against Kyoto, while a powerful\r\narmy of Kwanto bushi, led by the Nitta brothers, Yoshioki and\r\nYoshimune, as well as by Wakiya Yoshiharu, marched into Musashi and\r\ndefeated Takauji on the Kotesashi moor.\r\n\r\nThe invaders actually got possession of Kamakura, but the superior\r\nstrategy of the Ashikaga chief ultimately reversed the situation.\r\nYoshimune had to fly to Echigo with a petty remnant of followers, and\r\nYoshioki and Yoshiharu, evacuating Kamakura, took refuge in the\r\nKawamura fortress. Meanwhile, in Kyoto, things had fared in a\r\nsomewhat similar manner. The Southern generals carried everything\r\nbefore them at the outset, and Yoshiakira had to fly to Omi. But,\r\nafter a brief period of quiet, the Northern troops rallied and\r\nexpelled the Southern. Yoshiakira found himself again supreme. A\r\nstrange dilemma presented itself, however. There was no sovereign.\r\nThe retired sovereigns, Kogon, Komyo, and Suko, had all been carried\r\nto a place well within the Southern lines, and even the false regalia\r\nwere not available. Nevertheless, Yoshiakira, regardless of forms,\r\nraised to the throne the younger brother of Suko, who is known in\r\nhistory as Go-Kogon. Thenceforth, on the accession of a Northern\r\nsovereign a merely nominal ceremony of transferring the sacred\r\nregalia sufficed. As for the ex-Emperors Kogon and Komyo, they turned\r\ntheir backs finally on the world and became priests of the Zen sect\r\nof Buddhism.\r\n\r\nCAPTURE AND RE-CAPTURE OF KYOTO\r\n\r\nIn 1353, the Southern court received a signal accession of strength\r\nin the allegiance of the Yamana family and of Tadafuyu. The latter\r\nhas already been spoken of as an illegitimate son of Takauji, who,\r\nthrough the influence of his uncle, Tadayoshi, was appointed tandai\r\nof the western provinces. The death of his patron inclined this able\r\ncaptain to join the Southern Court, and his inclination was\r\ntranslated into action early in 1353, owing to need of support\r\nagainst the partisans of the Ashikaga in the island of Kyushu and the\r\nwestern provinces. As for the Yamana, they were of Minamoto lineage;\r\ntheir influence was supreme in Hoki and Inaba, and they faithfully\r\nespoused the Ashikaga cause until an unfulfilled promise of a manor\r\nalienated their good-will. For to such considerations of\r\nself-interest men not infrequently sacrificed their duty of\r\nallegiance in the troublous times of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nThus re-enforced, the Southern troops, under the supreme command of\r\nTadafuyu, marched against Kyoto in July, 1353, and captured the city.\r\nYoshiakira, guarding the young sovereign, Go-Kogon, effected his\r\nescape, and the Southern Emperor, Go-Murakami, issued a decree\r\ndepriving of their official ranks and possessions all Court nobles\r\nwho had assisted at the ceremony of the fugitive monarch's\r\ncoronation. But the supremacy of the South did not last long. In\r\nAugust, Yoshiakira was strong enough to countermarch against the\r\ncapital and to drive out Tadafuyu. Moreover, Takauji himself now\r\nfound it safe to leave the Kwanto. Placing his son Motouji in charge\r\nat Kamakura, he returned to Kyoto accompanying the Emperor Go-Kogon,\r\nand thenceforth during nearly two years the supremacy of the North\r\nwas practically undisputed.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF CHIKAFUSA\r\n\r\nFate willed that while his enemies were thus triumphant, death should\r\novertake the great statesman, strategist, and historian, Kitabatake\r\nChikafusa. He died in 1354, at the age of sixty-two. Japanese\r\nannalists say of Chikafusa: \"It was through his ability that the\r\nSouthern forces were co-ordinated and kept active in all parts of the\r\nempire. It was due to his clever strategy that Kyoto lay under\r\nconstant menace from the south. If the first great protagonists in\r\nthe struggle between the Northern and the Southern Courts were Prince\r\nMorinaga and Takauji, and those of the next were Nitta Yoshisada and\r\nTakauji, the third couple was Kitabatake Chikafusa and Takauji.\"\r\nChikafusa was of wide erudition; he had a wonderful memory, and his\r\nperpetual guides were justice and righteousness. After his death the\r\nSouthern Court fell into a state of division against itself; and its\r\nspirit sensibly declined.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF TAKAUJI\r\n\r\nTakauji survived Chikafusa by only four years; he expired in 1358.\r\nUndoubtedly his figure is projected in very imposing dimensions on\r\nthe pages of his country's history, and as the high mountain in the\r\nChinese proverb is gilded by the sunbeams and beaten by the storm, so\r\ncondemnation and eulogy have been poured upon his head by posterity.\r\nAn annalist of his time says: \"Yoritomo was impartial in bestowing\r\nrewards, but so severe in meting out punishments as to seem almost\r\ninhuman. Takauji, however, in addition to being humane and just, is\r\nstrong-minded, for no peril ever summons terror to his eye or\r\nbanishes the smile from his lip; merciful, for he knows no hatred and\r\ntreats his foes as his sons; magnanimous, for he counts gold and\r\nsilver as stones or sand, and generous, for he never compares the\r\ngift with the recipient, but gives away everything as it comes to\r\nhand. It is the custom for people to carry many presents to the\r\nshogun on the first day of the eighth month, but so freely are those\r\nthings given away that nothing remains by the evening, I am told.\"\r\n\r\nA later historian, Rai Sanyo (1780-1832), wrote: \"There were as brave\r\nmen and as clever in the days of the Minamoto as in the days of the\r\nAshikaga. Why, then, did the former never dare to take up arms\r\nagainst the Bakufu, whereas the latter never ceased to assault the\r\nAshikaga? It was because the Minamoto and the Hojo understood the\r\nexpediency of not entrusting too much power to potential rivals,\r\nwhereas the Ashikaga gave away lands so rashly that some families--as\r\nthe Akamatsu, the Hosokawa, and the Hatakeyama--came into the\r\npossession of three or four provinces, and in an extreme case one\r\nfamily--that of Yamana--controlled ten provinces, or one-sixth of the\r\nwhole empire. These septs, finding themselves so powerful, became\r\nunmanageable. Then the division of the Ashikaga into the Muromachi\r\nmagnates and the Kamakura chiefs brought two sets of rulers upon the\r\nsame stage, and naturally intrigue and distrust were born, so that,\r\nin the end, Muromachi was shaken by Hosokawa, and Kamakura was\r\noverthrown by Uesugi. An animal with too ponderous a tail cannot wag\r\nit, and a stick too heavy at one end is apt to break. The Ashikaga\r\nangled with such valuable bait that they ultimately lost both fish\r\nand bait. During the thirteen generations of their sway there was no\r\nrespite from struggle between family and family or between chief and\r\nvassal.\" Takauji's record plainly shows that deception was one of his\r\nweapons. He was absolutely unscrupulous. He knew also how to entice\r\nmen with gain, but he forgot that those who came for gain will go\r\nalso for gain. It would seem, too, that he sacrificed justice to the\r\nfear of alienating his supporters. Not otherwise can we account for\r\nhis leniency towards the Ko brothers, who were guilty of such\r\nviolations of propriety.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND ASHIKAGA SHOGUN\r\n\r\nTakauji was succeeded in the shogunate by his eldest son, Yoshiakira,\r\nof whom so much has already been heard. The fortunes of the Southern\r\nCourt were now at low ebb. During the year (1359) after Takauji's\r\ndeath, Kamakura contributed materially to the support of the Ashikaga\r\ncause. The Kwanto was then under the sway of Takauji's fourth son,\r\nMotouji, one of the ablest men of his time. He had just succeeded in\r\nquelling the defection of the Nitta family, and his military power\r\nwas so great that his captains conceived the ambition of marching to\r\nKyoto and supplanting Yoshiakira by Motouji. But the latter, instead\r\nof adopting this disloyal counsel, despatched a large army under\r\nHatakeyama Kunikiyo to attack the Southern Court. Marching by the two\r\nhighways of Settsu and Kawachi, this army attacked Yoshino and gained\r\nsome important successes. But the fruits of these victories were not\r\ngathered. The Hatakeyama chief developed ambitions of his own, and,\r\non returning to the Kwanto, was crushed by Motouji and deprived of\r\nhis office of shitsuji, that post being given again to Uesugi\r\nNoriaki, \"who had been in exile since the death of Tadayoshi in 1352.\r\nAt, or shortly after, this time, Kai and Izu and, later on, Mutsu,\r\nwere put under Kamakura jurisdiction, and their peaceful and orderly\r\ncondition formed a marked contrast to the general state of the rest\r\nof the empire.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe next event of cardinal importance in this much disturbed period\r\nwas the defection of Hosokawa Kiyouji, one of the shitsuji in Kyoto.\r\nThis powerful chief, disappointed in his expectations of reward, went\r\nover to the Southern Court in 1361, and the result was that the\r\nAshikaga shogun had to flee from Kyoto, escorting Go-Kogon. The\r\nsituation soon changed however. Hosokawa Kiyouji, returning to his\r\nnative province, Awa, essayed to bring the whole of Shikoku into\r\nallegiance to the Southern Court, but was signally worsted by his\r\ncousin, Hosokawa Yoriyuki--afterwards very famous,--and scarcely a\r\nmonth had elapsed before Yoshiakira was back in the capital. In the\r\nsame year (1362), the Northerners received a marked increase of\r\nstrength by the accession of the Yamana family, which was at that\r\ntime supreme in the five central provinces of eastern Japan--namely,\r\nTamba, Inaba, Bizen, Bitchu, and Mimasaka. During ten years this\r\nfamily had supported the Southern Court, but its chief, Tokiuji, now\r\nyielded to the persuasion of Yoshiakira's emissaries, and espoused\r\nthe Ashikaga cause on condition that he, Tokiuji, should be named\r\nhigh constable of the above five provinces.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the partisans of the late Tadayoshi--the Kira, the Ishido,\r\nthe Momonoi, the Nikki, and others--constituted a source of perpetual\r\nmenace, and even among the Ashikaga themselves there was a rebel\r\n(Takatsune). Yoshiakira became weary of the unceasing strife. He\r\naddressed overtures to the Southern Court and they were accepted on\r\ncondition that he made formal act of surrender. This the shogun\r\nrefused to do, but he treated Go-Murakami's envoy with every mark of\r\nrespect, and though the pourparlers proved finally abortive, they had\r\ncontinued for five months, an evidence that both sides were anxious\r\nto find a path to peace. Yoshiakira died in the same year, 1367.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN COURT\r\n\r\nPreviously to this event, a new trouble had occurred in the Southern\r\nCourt. The Emperor Go-Murakami signified his desire to abdicate, and\r\nthereupon the Court nobles who had followed the three ex-Emperors\r\ninto the Southern lines in 1352 fell into two cliques, each\r\nadvocating the nomination of a different successor. This discord\r\nexercised a debilitating influence, and when Go-Murakami died (1368),\r\nthe Southerners found themselves in a parlous condition. For his son\r\nand successor, Chokei, failing to appreciate the situation,\r\nimmediately planned an extensive campaign against Kyoto from the east\r\nand the south simultaneously. Then Kusunoki Masanori passed into the\r\nNorthern camp. Few events have received wider historical comment in\r\nJapan. The Kusunoki family stood for everything loyal and devoted in\r\nthe bushi's record, and Masanori was a worthy chief of the sept. So\r\nconspicuous were his virtues and so attractive was his personality\r\nthat a samurai of the Akamatsu family, who had planned a vendetta\r\nagainst him, committed suicide himself rather than raise his hand to\r\nslay such a hero.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to account for Masanori's infidelity to the cause\r\nhe had embraced? The answer of his country's most credible annalists\r\nis that his motive was to save the Southern Court. He saw that if the\r\nyoung Emperor. Chokei, persisted in his design of a general campaign\r\nagainst Kyoto, a crushing defeat must be the outcome, and since the\r\nsovereign would not pay heed to his remonstrances, he concluded that\r\nthe only way to arrest the mad enterprise was his own defection,\r\nwhich would weaken the South too much to permit offensive action.\r\nAshikaga Yoshimitsu was then shogun at Muromachi. He had succeeded to\r\nthat office in 1367, at the age of nine, and his father, then within\r\na year of death, had entrusted him to the care of Hosokawa Yoriyuki,\r\none of the ablest men of his own or any generation. There are strong\r\nreasons for thinking that between this statesman and Masanori an\r\nunderstanding existed. So long as Yoriyuki remained in power there\r\nwas nothing worthy of the name of war between the two Courts, and\r\nwhen, after his retirement in 1379, the struggle re-opened under the\r\ndirection of his successor (a Yamana chief), Masanori returned to his\r\nold allegiance and took the field once more in the Southern cause.\r\nHis action in temporarily changing his allegiance had given ten\r\nyears' respite to the Southerners.\r\n\r\nPEACE BETWEEN THE TWO COURTS\r\n\r\nThe Southern Emperor, Chokei, coming to the throne in 1368, abdicated\r\nin 1372 in favour of his brother, known in history as Go-Kameyama.\r\nDuring his brief tenure of power Chokei's extensive plans for the\r\ncapture of Kyoto did not mature, but he had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the whole island of Kyushu wrested from Ashikaga hands. It is\r\ntrue that under the able administration of Imagawa Sadayo (Ryoshun),\r\na tandai appointed by the Ashikaga, this state of affairs was largely\r\nremedied during the next ten years, but as the last substantial\r\ntriumph of the Yoshino arms the record of Chokei's reign is\r\nmemorable. It was, in truth, the final success. The decade of\r\ncomparative quiet that ensued on the main island proved to be the\r\ncalm before the storm.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent figures in the closing chapter of the great\r\ndynastic struggle are Hosokawa Yoriyuki and Yamana Mitsuyuki. When\r\nthe second Ashikaga shogun, Yoshiakira, recognized that his days were\r\nnumbered, he summoned his trusted councillor, Hosokawa Yoriyuki, and\r\nhis son Yoshimitsu, and said to the latter, \"I give you a father,\"\r\nand to the former, \"I give you a son.\" Yoriyuki faithfully discharged\r\nthe trust thus reposed in him. He surrounded his youthful charge with\r\nliterary and military experts, and secured to him every advantage\r\nthat education could confer. Moreover, this astute statesman seems to\r\nhave apprehended that if the cause of the Southern Court were not\r\nactually opposed, it would die of inanition, and he therefore\r\nemployed all his influence to preserve peace. He endeavoured also to\r\nenforce strict obedience to the economical precepts of the Kemmu\r\ncode, and altogether the ethics he favoured were out of harmony with\r\nthe social conditions of Kyoto at the time and with the natural\r\nproclivities of the young shogun himself. In fine, he had to leave\r\nthe capital, too full of his enemies, and to retire to his native\r\nprovince, Awa.\r\n\r\nDuring ten years he remained in seclusion. But, in 1389, a journey\r\nmade by the shogun to Miya-jima revealed so many evidences of\r\nYoriyuki's loyalty that he was invited to return to Kyoto, and with\r\nhis assistance the organization of the Ashikaga forces at Muromachi\r\nwas brought to a high state of efficiency, partly because the astute\r\nYoriyuki foresaw trouble with the Yamana family, which was then\r\nsupreme in no less than ten provinces, or nearly one-sixth of all\r\nJapan. In 1391 Yamana Ujikiyo and his kinsman Mitsuyuki took the\r\nfield against Kyoto under the standard of the Southern Court. He\r\ncommanded a great army, and there resulted a desperate struggle known\r\nin history as the Meitoku War, after the name of the year-period when\r\nit occurred. The Yamana leader was killed and his army completely\r\nrouted. In the following year, the great Hosokawa Yoriyuki died. He\r\nhad lived to see the ten provinces recovered from Yamana rule and\r\npartitioned among the Muromachi generals.\r\n\r\nBut he expired just before the final triumph to which his genius had\r\nso materially contributed. For within a few months of his demise the\r\nWar of the Dynasties came at last to a close. The proximate cause was\r\nthe fall of the Kusunoki stronghold, which had been built by\r\nMasashige, and during sixty years had remained unconquered. With its\r\nreduction, preceded as it had been by the annihilation of the Yamana,\r\nthe fortunes of the Southern Court had become hopeless, and overtures\r\ncarried from Kyoto by one of the most distinguished of the Muromachi\r\ngenerals, Ouchi Yoshihiro, were accepted. Go-Komatsu then occupied\r\nthe Northern throne. He had succeeded Go-Enyu, in 1382, and the\r\nlatter, had succeeded Go-Kogon, in 1371. Go-Komatsu, having been only\r\nsix years of age at the time of his accession, was in his sixteenth\r\nyear when the two Courts came to an agreement.\r\n\r\nFor a time the terms proved very difficult of adjustment, but\r\nultimately it was decided that the Southern sovereign, Go-Kameyama,\r\nshould abdicate in favour of the Northern, the former being\r\nthenceforth treated as the latter's father. This compact having been\r\nconcluded, the sacred insignia were transported from Yoshino to Kyoto\r\nwith all solemnity. Six Court nobles accompanied them from the South;\r\ntwenty went out from the North to receive them, and a numerous body\r\nof troops formed the escort. The retiring Emperor spent ten days at\r\nthe palace in Kyoto, throughout which time a magnificent banquet was\r\nheld to celebrate the conclusion of the fifty-five years' war.\r\nYoshino and other districts were assigned for the support of the\r\nex-Emperor, and pensions or domains were conferred on the Court\r\nnobles of the South, some of whom, however, declining to compromise\r\ntheir sense of honour by accepting favours from the North, withdrew\r\nto the provinces; and their exile was shared by several of the\r\nmilitary leaders who had remained true to the South throughout. There\r\ncan be little doubt that among these apparent implacables were some\r\nof a selfishly calculating disposition, who, anticipating a reversion\r\nto the system of alternate succession, as instituted by the Hojo\r\ninterpreters of Go-Saga's testament, looked for greater personal\r\nadvantage when the Crown should come to the Southern branch than\r\nanything that could be hoped for by submitting to the Northern. They\r\nwere mistaken. That testament, which had done so much mischief in its\r\ntime, was ignored from the close of the War of the Dynasties. It did\r\nnot fall into total abeyance, however, without some further\r\nbloodshed, and the facts may be interpolated here so as to dispose\r\nfinally of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn 1412, the abdication of Go-Komatsu should have been followed by\r\nthe accession of a Southern prince had the principle of alternation\r\nbeen pursued. It was not so followed. On the contrary, the sceptre\r\nfell to Shoko--101st sovereign--son of Go-Komatsu. Hence, in 1413,\r\nDate Yasumune, in Mutsu, and, in 1414, Kitabatake Mitsumasa, in Ise,\r\nmade armed protests, gallant but ineffective. Again, in 1428, on the\r\nchildless death of Shoko, the claims of the Southern line were\r\ntacitly ignored in favour of Go-Hanazono, grandson of the third\r\nNorthern Emperor, Suko. The same Mitsumasa now took the field, aided\r\nthis time by Masahide, head of the ever loyal house of Kusunoki, but\r\nsignal failure ensued. The last struggle in behalf of the Southern\r\nline took place in 1443, when \"a band of determined men under\r\nKusunoki Jiro and the Court noble, Hino Arimitsu, suddenly assailed\r\nthe palace from two directions; all but succeeded in killing or\r\ncapturing the Emperor, and actually got possession of the regalia.\r\nThey were soon driven out, however, and in their flight to Hiei-zan,\r\nwhere one body of them entrenched themselves, the mirror and the\r\nsword were dropped and recovered by the pursuers. The other body made\r\ngood their escape to the wilds of Odai-ga-hara, carrying with them\r\nthe seal; and it was not till a year later that it found its way back\r\nto Kyoto, when the rebels had been destroyed.\"*\r\n\r\n*Murdoch's History of Japan.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KOZUKA AND MENUKI (SWORD FURNITURE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nTWO BRANCHES OF THE ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nTHE Ashikaga family was divided into two main branches, both\r\ndescended from Takauji. The representatives of one, the senior,\r\nbranch had their headquarters at Muromachi in Kyoto and held the\r\noffice of shogun as a hereditary right. There were fifteen\r\ngenerations:\r\n\r\n       Name            Born Succeeded Abdicated Died\r\n\r\n   (1) Takauji         1305 1338      ....      1358\r\n\r\n   (2) Yoshiakira      1330 1358      1367      1368\r\n\r\n   (3) Yoshimitsu      1358 1367      1395      1408\r\n\r\n   (4) Yoshimochi      1386 1395      1423      1428\r\n\r\n   (5) Yoshikazu       1407 1423      ....      1425\r\n\r\n   (6) Yoshinori       1394 1428      ....      1441\r\n\r\n   (7) Yoshikatsu      1433 1441      ....      1443\r\n\r\n   (8) Yoshimasa       1435 1443      1474      1490\r\n\r\n   (9) Yoshihisa       1465 1474      ....      1489\r\n\r\n   (10) Yoshitane (#1) 1465 1490      1493      ....\r\n\r\n   (11) Yoshizumi      1478 1493      1508      1511\r\n\r\n        Yoshitane (#2) .... 1508      1521      1522\r\n\r\n   (12) Yoshiharu      1510 1521      1545      1550\r\n\r\n   (13) Yoshiteru      1535 1545      ....      1565\r\n\r\n   (14) Yoshihide      1565 1565      ....      1568\r\n\r\n   (15) Yoshiaki       1537 1568      1573      1597\r\n\r\nThe apparent clashing of dates in the case of the fourth and fifth\r\nshoguns, Yoshimochi and Yoshikazu, is due to the fact that on the\r\ndeath of the latter, in 1425, the former resumed the office and held\r\nit until his own death, in 1428.\r\n\r\n   THE KAMAKURA KWANRYO AND KUBO\r\n\r\n                    Born   Died\r\n\r\n   (1) Motouji      1340   1367\r\n\r\n   (2) Ujimitsu     1357   1398\r\n\r\n   (3) Mitsukane    1376   1409\r\n\r\n   (4) Mochiuji     1398   1439\r\n\r\n   (5) Shigeuji     1434   1497\r\n\r\n   (6) Masatomo     ....   1491\r\n\r\n   (7) Takamoto     ....   ....\r\n\r\n   (8) Haruuji      ....   1560\r\n\r\n   (9) Yoshiuji     ....   ....\r\n\r\nThe title \"kwanryo,\" as already stated, signifies \"governor-general,\"\r\nand the region governed was the eight provinces of the Kwanto,\r\ntogether with Izu and Kai. The first of the Ashikaga kwanryo,\r\nMotouji, was Takauji's youngest son, and the following eight names on\r\nthe above list were direct descendants. But not all had the title of\r\nkwanryo or wielded the extensive power attached to that office. Only\r\nthe first four were thus fortunate. From the days of the fifth,\r\nShigeuji, evil times overtook the family. Driven out of Kamakura by\r\nthe Uesugi, who had hitherto served as manager (shitsuji), they were\r\nobliged to change their domicile to Koga in Shimosa; their sphere of\r\njurisdiction was reduced to four provinces, namely, Shimosa,\r\nShimotsuke, Kazusa, and Awa; their official title was altered to\r\ngosho or kubo, and their former title of kwanryo passed to the Uesugi\r\nfamily who also replaced them at Kamakura. These things fell out in\r\n1439, when Mochiuji died. To avoid confusion it is necessary to note\r\nthat the chief official in the shogun's court at Muromachi in Kyoto\r\nwas also called kwanryo. He had originally been termed \"manager\"\r\n(shitsuji), but, in 1367, this was changed to \"governor-general,\" and\r\nthe corresponding functions were practically those discharged by the\r\nregent (shikken) in the polity of the old Bakufu. The first Muromachi\r\nkwanryo was Shiba Yoshimasa, and it became the ultimate custom to\r\ngive the post to a member of one of three families, the Shiba, the\r\nHosokawa, and the Hatakeyama.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE PROVINCES\r\n\r\nWhen swords were sheathed after the long and wasting War of the\r\nDynasties, the Ashikaga found themselves in a strong position. Having\r\nfull control of the Court, they could treat as a rebel anyone\r\nopposing them by force of arms, and their partisans were so numerous\r\nin Kyoto and its vicinity that they could impose their will upon all.\r\nIn the east, the Kwanto was effectually ruled by a branch of their\r\nown family, and in the north as well as in the south they were\r\nrepresented by tandai, who governed stoutly and loyally. But trouble\r\nbegan very soon. In Kyushu the office of tandai was held by Imagawa\r\nRyoshun, a man ever memorable in Japanese history as the author of\r\nthe precept that military prowess without education is worse than\r\nuseless. Ryoshun had been selected for service in Kyushu by the great\r\nshitsuji of Muromachi, Hosokawa Yoriyuki, who saw that only by the\r\nstrongest hands could the turbulent families of the southern island\r\nbe reduced to order--the Shimazu, the Otomo, the Shoni, and the\r\nKikuchi. Everything went to show that Imagawa would have succeeded\r\nhad not that familiar weapon, slander, been utilized for his\r\noverthrow. The Otomo chief persuaded Ouchi Yoshihiro to traduce\r\nRyoshun, and since the Ouchi sept exercised great influence in the\r\ncentral provinces and had taken a prominent part in composing the War\r\nof the Dynasties, the shogun, Yoshimitsu, could not choose but listen\r\nto charges coming from such a source. Imagawa Ryoshun was recalled\r\n(1396), and thenceforth Kyushu became the scene of almost perpetual\r\nwarfare which the Muromachi authorities were powerless to check.\r\n\r\nTHE OUCHI FAMILY\r\n\r\nIt was to the same Ouchi family that the Muromachi shogun owed his\r\nfirst serious trouble after the close of the War of the Dynasties.\r\nThe ancestor of the family had been a Korean prince who migrated to\r\nJapan early in the seventh century, and whose descendants, five and a\r\nhalf centuries later, were admitted to the ranks of the samurai. The\r\noutbreak of the War of the Dynasties had found the Ouchi ranged on\r\nthe Southern side, but presently they espoused the Ashikaga cause,\r\nand distinguished themselves conspicuously against the Kikuchi in\r\nKyushu and, above all, in promoting the conclusion of the dynastic\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nThese eminent services were recognized by Ouchi Yoshihiro's\r\nappointment to administer no less than six provinces--Nagato, Suwo,\r\nAki, Buzen, Kii, and Izumi. In fact he guarded the western and\r\neastern entrances of the Inland Sea, and held the overlordship of\r\nwestern Japan. At his castle in Sakai, near Osaka, he amassed wealth\r\nby foreign trade, and there he received and harboured representatives\r\nof the Kusunoki and Kikuchi families, while at the same time he\r\ncarried on friendly communications with the Doki, the Ikeda, and the\r\nYamana. In short, he grew too powerful to receive mandates from\r\nMuromachi, especially when they came through a kwanryo of the\r\nHatakeyama family who had just risen to that distinction.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in November, 1399, the Ouchi chief appeared in Izumi at the\r\nhead of a force of twenty-three thousand men, a force which received\r\nrapid and numerous accessions. His grounds of disaffection were that\r\nhe suspected the shogun of a design to deprive him of the two\r\nprovinces of Kii and Izumi, which were far remote from the other five\r\nprovinces in his jurisdiction and which placed him within arm's\r\nlength of Kyoto, and, further, that no sufficient reward had been\r\ngiven to the family of his younger brother, who fell in battle. There\r\nwere minor grievances, but evidently all were pretexts: the real\r\nobject was to overthrow Muromachi. The shogun, Yoshimitsu, acted with\r\ngreat promptitude. He placed Hatakeyama Mitsuiye at the head of a\r\npowerful army, and on January 18, 1400, Sakai fell and Yoshihiro\r\ncommitted suicide. Thereafter the province of Kii was placed under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Hatakeyama family, and Izumi under that of\r\nHosokawa, while the Shiba ruled in Echizen, Owari, and Totomi. In\r\nshort, these three families became the bulwarks of the Ashikaga.\r\n\r\nKAMAKURA AND MUROMACHI\r\n\r\nAn important episode of the Ouchi struggle was that Mitsukane, the\r\nthird Kamakura kwanryo of the Ashikaga line, moved an army into\r\nMusashi to render indirect assistance to the Ouchi cause. In truth,\r\nfrom an early period of Kamakura's tenure by an Ashikaga\r\ngovernor-general of the Kwanto, there had been an ambition to\r\ntransfer the office of shogun from the Kyoto to the Kamakura branch\r\nof the family. The matter was not mooted during Takauji's lifetime,\r\nbut when, on his demise, the comparatively incompetent Yoshiakira\r\ncame into power at Muromachi, certain military magnates of the\r\neastern provinces urged the Kamakura kwanryo, Motouji, to usurp his\r\nbrother's position. Motouji, essentially as loyal as he was astute,\r\nspurned the proposition. But it was not so with his son and\r\nsuccessor, Ujimitsu. To him the ambition of winning the shogunate\r\npresented itself strongly, and was only abandoned when Uesugi\r\nNoriharu committed suicide to add weight to a protest against such an\r\nessay. Japanese annals contain many records of lives thus sacrificed\r\non the altar of devotion and loyalty. From the outset the Uesugi\r\nfamily were the pillars of the Ashikaga kwanryo in Kamakura. Uesugi\r\nNoriaki served as shitsuji in the time of the first kwanryo, and the\r\nsame service was rendered by Noriaki's son, Yoshinori, and by the\r\nlatter's nephew, Tomomune, in the time of the second kwanryo,\r\nUjimitsu. Confusing as are the multitude of names that confront the\r\nforeign student of Japanese history, it is necessary to note that\r\nfrom the time of their appointment as shitsuji at Kamakura, Yoshinori\r\ntook the family name of Yamanouchi, and Tomomune that of Ogigayatsu.\r\nBalked in his design against Kyoto, Ujimitsu turned his hand against\r\nthe Nitta, old enemies of his family, and crushing them, placed the\r\nAshikaga power on a very firm basis in the Kwanto. His son,\r\nMitsukane, had the gift of handling troops with great skill, and in\r\nhis time the prestige of the Kamakura kwanryo reached its highest\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the military men of the eastern provinces, the\r\nshogun in distant Kyoto counted for little compared with the\r\ngovernor-general in adjacent Kamakura. The latter's mansion was\r\ncalled gosho (palace); its occupant was termed kubo, an epithet\r\nhitherto applied to the shogun only, and the elder and younger\r\nbranches of the Uesugi family, in which the office of kwanryo of\r\nMuromachi was hereditary, were designated Ryo Uesugi (the Two\r\nUesugi). Mitsukane, when he abetted the Ouchi's attempt to overthrow\r\nthe Kyoto shogun, persuaded himself that he was only carrying out his\r\nfather's unachieved purpose, and the shogun, Yoshimitsu, took no step\r\nto punish him, preferring to accept his overtures--made through\r\nUesugi Tomomune.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTRAVAGANCE OF YOSHIMITSU\r\n\r\nThere is little question that whatever applause history can extend to\r\nthe administration of the third Ashikaga shogun, Yoshimitsu, was won\r\nfor him by his profoundly sagacious guardian and chief minister,\r\nHosokawa Yoriyuki. After the latter's death, in 1392, many abuses and\r\nfew meritorious acts appear in the shogun's record. Alike, the wise\r\nself-effacement and the admirable frugality which distinguished the\r\nHojo rule were wholly foreign to the mood of Yoshimitsu. He insisted\r\non being raised to the post of chancellor of the empire, and he\r\nopenly spoke of himself as \"king,\" designating as Go-sekke (Five\r\nRegent Houses) the families of Shiba, Hosokawa, Hatakeyama, Rokkaku,\r\nand Yumana. At the ceremony of his investiture as chancellor (dajo\r\ndaijiri) he presented to the Throne a sword forged by Kunimitsu; one\r\nhundred pieces of white silk; one thousand silver coins; ten tigers'\r\nskins, and fifty pounds of dyed silk. To the ex-Emperor he gave a\r\nthousand silver coins; fifty pieces of white silk, and a sword, and\r\namong the Imperial princes and Court nobles he distributed ten\r\nthousand pieces of silver. Such was his parade of opulence.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ASHIKAGA YOSHIMITSU\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle to conferring on him the title of chancellor had\r\nbeen that the records contained only one instance of a military man's\r\nappointment to that exalted post. That instance was Taira no\r\nKiyomori, whose example should have been deterrent to a Minamoto.\r\nYoshimitsu overcame the difficulty by nominally transferring his\r\nmilitary functions to his son Yoshimochi (1423), and constituting\r\nhimself the patron of literature. It was now that his love of luxury\r\nand splendour assumed its full dimensions. He had already beautified\r\nhis Muromachi mansion by constructing there a park so spacious and so\r\nbrilliant at all seasons that it went by the name of Hana no Gosho\r\n(Palace of Flowers). This he now assigned as a residence for his son\r\nand successor, Yoshimochi, transferring his own place of abode to the\r\nsite occupied by the Saionji family, to whom was given in exchange an\r\nextensive manor in Kawachi. Here the Ashikaga chancellor built a\r\npalace of such dimensions that sixteen superintendents and twenty\r\nassistant superintendents were required to oversee the work. Most\r\nconspicuous was the Kinkaku-ji, or golden pavilion shrine, so called\r\nbecause its interior was gilt, the gold foil being thickly superposed\r\non lacquer varnish. On this edifice, on the adjacent palace, and on a\r\npark where deer roamed and noble pine trees hung over their own\r\nshadows in a picturesque lake, immense sums were expended. Works of\r\nart were collected from all quarters to enhance the charm of a palace\r\nconcerning which the bonze Sekkei declared that it could not be\r\nexchanged for paradise.\r\n\r\nYoshimitsu prayed the Emperor to visit this unprecedentedly beautiful\r\nretreat and Go-Komatsu complied. During twenty days a perpetual round\r\nof pastimes was devised for the entertainment of the sovereign and\r\nthe Court nobles--couplet composing, music, football, boating,\r\ndancing, and feasting. All this was typical of the life Yoshimitsu\r\nled after his resignation of the shogun's office. Pleasure trips\r\nengrossed his attention--trips to Ise, to Yamato, to Hyogo, to\r\nWakasa, and so forth. He set the example of luxury, and it found\r\nfollowers on the part of all who aimed at being counted fashionable,\r\nwith the inevitable result that the producing classes were taxed\r\nbeyond endurance. It has to be noted, too, that although Yoshimitsu\r\nlived in nominal retirement at his Kita-yama palace, he really\r\ncontinued to administer the affairs of the empire.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL HUMILIATION\r\n\r\nIt is not for arrogance, or yet for extravagance, that Japanese\r\nhistorians chiefly reproach Yoshimitsu. His unpardonable sin in their\r\neyes is that he humiliated his country. From the accession of the\r\nMing dynasty (1368) China made friendly overtures to Japan,\r\nespecially desiring the latter to check the raids of her corsairs\r\nwho, as in the days of the Hojo after the repulse of the Mongol\r\narmada, so also in the times of the Ashikaga, were a constant menace\r\nto the coastwise population of the neighbouring continent. Upon the\r\nattitude of the shogun towards these remonstrances and overtures\r\ndepended the prosecution of commerce with the Middle Kingdom, and the\r\nprofits accruing from that commerce were too considerable to be\r\nneglected by a ruler like Yoshimitsu, whose extravagance required\r\nconstant accessions of revenue. Moreover, the Muromachi shogun was a\r\ndisciple and patron of the Zen sect of Buddhism, and the priests of\r\nthat sect always advocated peaceful intercourse with China, the\r\nsource of philosophic and literary learning.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations induced the Ashikaga chief not only to issue\r\norders for the restraint of the corsairs, but also to receive from\r\nthe Chinese Court despatches in which he was plainly designated the\r\nking of a country tributary to China, and to make answer in language\r\nunequivocally endorsing the propriety of such terminology. In one\r\ndespatch, dated February, 1403, Yoshimitsu described himself as a\r\n\"subject of Ming\" and, \"prostrate, begged to present twenty horses,\r\nten thousand catties of sulphur, thirty-two pieces of agate, three\r\ngold-foil folding screens, one thousand lances, one hundred swords, a\r\nsuit of armour, and an ink-stone.\" It is recorded that he even\r\nhumbled himself so far as to ask for supplies of Chinese coins, and\r\ncertainly these comparatively pure copper tokens remained largely in\r\ncirculation in Japan down to Tokugawa times, under the name of\r\nEiraku-tsuho, Eiraku being the Japanese sound of the Chinese\r\nyear-period, Yunglo (1403-1422).\r\n\r\nDEATH OF YOSHIMITSU\r\n\r\nYoshimitsu died in 1408. He was accorded by the Court the posthumous\r\nrank of Dajo Tenno (ex-Emperor), a proof of the extraordinary\r\nconfusion of etiquette caused by his arrogant pretensions. The\r\nChinese sovereign, Yunglo, sent a message of sympathy to the Japanese\r\npotentate's son, Yoshimochi, in which the deceased was designated\r\n\"Prince Kung-hsien,\" but Yoshimochi, though not distinguished for\r\nability, had sufficient wisdom ultimately to adopt the advice of the\r\nkwanryo, Shiba Yoshimasa, and to decline the rank of Dajo Tenno, as\r\nwell as to break off relations with the Ming ruler. Yoshimochi also\r\nhanded over the magnificent edifice at Kita-yama to the Buddhist\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR SHOKO\r\n\r\nIn 1412, the Emperor Go-Komatsu abdicated in favour of his son Shoko\r\n(101st sovereign), then twelve years old. This sovereign abandoned\r\nhimself to the profligacy of the era. It is doubtful whether his\r\nreason was not unhinged. Some accounts say that he fell into a state\r\nof lunacy; others, that he practised magic arts. At all events he\r\ndied childless in 1428, and was succeeded by a grandson of the\r\nEmperor Suko, Go-Hanazono, then in his tenth year. Thus, the claims\r\nof the Southern dynasty were ignored twice consecutively, and its\r\npartisans made armed protests in the provinces, as has been already\r\nnoted. But these struggles proved abortive, and thereafter history is\r\nno more troubled with such episodes. The Daikagu-ji line disappears\r\naltogether from view, and the throne is occupied solely by\r\nrepresentatives of the Jimyo-in. There can be very little doubt that\r\nthe former was the legitimate branch; but fortune was against it.\r\n\r\nYOSHIMOCHI, YOSHIKAZU, AND YOSHINORI\r\n\r\nYoshimochi, son of Yoshimitsu, became shogun (1395) at the age of\r\nnine, and the administration was conducted by Hosokawa Mitsumoto,\r\nShiba Yoshishige, and Hatakeyama Mitsuiye. Twenty-eight years later,\r\nthat is to say, in 1423, he abdicated in favour of his son,\r\nYoshikazu. The cause of that step deserves notice. Yoshimitsu had\r\nintended to pass over Yoshimochi, his first-born, in favour of his\r\nsecond son, Yoshitsugu, but death prevented the consummation of that\r\ndesign. Yoshimochi, however, knew that it had been entertained.\r\nTherefore, after the death of their father, he seized Yoshitsugu,\r\nthrew him into prison, and ultimately caused him to be killed. With\r\nthe blood of his younger brother on his hands he abdicated in favour\r\nof his own sixteen-year-old son, Yoshikazu. But the latter died--some\r\nhistorians say that dissipation destroyed him--in two years, and\r\nhaving no second son to succeed, Yoshimochi himself resumed the\r\noffice of shogun, holding it until his death, in 1428.\r\n\r\nDuring his thirty-three years' tenure of power this ruler seems to\r\nhave aimed solely at enjoying the sweets of ease and tranquillity. He\r\nleft the provinces severely alone and thought only of the peace of\r\nthe metropolis. Turbulent displays on the part of self-appointed\r\npartisans of the Southern Court; intrigues in the Kwanto; revolts\r\namong his own immediate followers--all these things were treated by\r\nYoshimochi with gloved hands so long as the atmosphere of Kyoto was\r\nnot troubled. In 1428, he fell sick, and, the end being in sight, he\r\nordered his advisers to consult about his successor. Some advocated\r\nthe appointment of his kinsman, Mochiuji, governor-general of the\r\nKwanto, and Mochiuji himself prayed that it should be so. But the\r\nchoice ultimately fell on Yoshimochi's younger brother, Gien, who had\r\nembraced religion and was then serving as abbot of the temple\r\nShoren-in.\r\n\r\nThis man, then in his thirty-fourth year, hesitated to accept the\r\nnomination, but was induced to do so. He changed his name to\r\nYoshinori, and assuming the office in 1428, showed high talents and\r\ngreat intrepidity. He was, in truth, a ruler as efficient as his\r\npredecessor had been perfunctory. One of the most important events of\r\nhis time was the ruin of the Ashikaga Bakufu at Kamakura. Between\r\nKamakura and Muromachi there had been friction from an early date. We\r\nhave seen the second and third governors-general of the Kwanto,\r\nUjimitsu and Mitsukane, plotting to supplant the elder branch of\r\ntheir family in Kyoto, and we have seen how the accession of the\r\npriest, Yoshinori, had disappointed the ambition of the fourth\r\ngovernor-general, Mochiuji, who, if unable to become shogun himself,\r\nwould fain have obtained that high office for his son, Yoshihisa.\r\nSeveral years previously, namely, in 1417, there had occurred a feud\r\nbetween the Yamanouchi and the Ogigayatsu branches of the Uesugi\r\nfamily in the Kwanto, the former represented by Norimoto, the latter\r\nby Ujinori. The Uesugi stood next to the Ashikaga at Kamakura, the\r\nimportant office of manager (shitsuji) being invariably held by the\r\nhead of the former house. It would have been well-nigh impossible\r\ntherefore for the governor-general to view such a feud with\r\nindifference. Mochiuji, then in his twentieth year, sympathized with\r\nNorimoto, and in the sequel, Ujinori, with whom was allied Mochiuji's\r\nyounger brother, Mochinaka, took the field at the head of such a\r\nforce that the governor-general must have succumbed had not the\r\nshogun, Yoshimochi, rendered aid.\r\n\r\nThis should have placed Kamakura under a heavy debt of gratitude to\r\nMuromachi. But Mochiuji was not subject to such emotions. He rebelled\r\nvehemently against the lenient treatment accorded to Ujinori's son\r\nafter their father's death, and the shogun had difficulty in\r\nplacating him. So long, however, as Yoshimochi ruled in Kyoto, the\r\nKamakura kwanrya abstained from further intrigues; but on the\r\naccession of the sometime bonze, Yoshinori, to the shogunate, all\r\nsense of restraint was removed. The governor-general now made no\r\nattempt to conceal his hostility to the Muromachi shogun. Certain\r\nfamily rights imperatively demanding reference to the shogun were not\r\nso referred, and Mochiuji not only spurned the remonstrances of the\r\nmanager (shitsuji), Uesugi Norimoto, but even attempted to kill the\r\nlatter's son, Norizane. All efforts to reconcile the Kwanto and the\r\nshitsuji proved futile, and Norizane had to flee to Kotsuke. No\r\nsooner did these things come to the ears of the shogun, Yoshinori,\r\nthan he obtained an Imperial commission to quell the insurgents, and\r\nplacing an army under the orders of Mochifusa, a son of Ujinori,\r\ndirected him to march against Kamakura.\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed as if the Kamakura men would emerge victorious. At\r\nthe easily defended passes of Hakone they inflicted several\r\nsuccessive though not signal defeats upon Mochifusa's army. But the\r\nappearance of Norizane in the field quickly changed the complexion of\r\nthe campaign. Very soon the Kamakura force was shattered, and\r\nMochiuji himself fled to the temple Shomyo-ji in Kanazawa, where he\r\nbegged to be allowed to retire from the world. But the shogun\r\ndeclined to pardon him and remained obdurate in spite of earnest and\r\nrepeated petitions from Norizane, praying that Mochiuji should be\r\nforgiven and allowed to retire in favour of his son, Yoshihisa. In\r\nthe end, Mochiuji, his son, his uncle, and many others all died by\r\ntheir own hands. These things happened in 1439. The redeeming feature\r\nof the sombre family feud was the fine loyalty of Norizane. Though it\r\nhad been against him chiefly that Mochiuji raged, and though his\r\ndeath was certain had he fallen under the power of the Kamakura\r\nkwanryo, Mochiuji's fate caused him such remorse that he attempted to\r\ncommit suicide and finally became a priest. Thenceforth, the title of\r\ngovernor-general of the Kwanto passed to the Uesugi, two of whom were\r\nappointed to act simultaneously. As for the Kamakura Ashikaga, the\r\nthree remaining sons of Mochiuji fled to Koga in Shimosa, where two\r\nof them were subsequently killed by a Kamakura army, and the third,\r\nShigeuji, fared as has already been described.\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF THE SHOGUN\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that Akamatsu Norimura was among the captains who\r\ncontributed most to the triumph of the Ashikaga cause. In recognition\r\nof his distinguished services the offices of high constable in the\r\nfive provinces of Settsu, Inaba, Harima, Mimasaka, and Bizen were\r\ngiven to his three sons. Mitsusuke, grandson of the eldest of these,\r\nadministered three of the above provinces in the days of the fourth\r\nAshikaga shogun, Yoshimochi. A puny man of contemptible presence,\r\nMitsusuke received little consideration at Muromachi, and the shogun\r\nwas induced to promise his office of high constable to a handsome\r\nkinsman, Mochisada. Enraged at such partiality, Mitsusuke set fire to\r\nhis mansion in Kyoto and withdrew to his castle at Shirahata in\r\nHarima. When, however, the shogun would have sent an army against\r\nhim, none was found to take command, Mochisada having given universal\r\noffence by his haughty arrogance. In the sequel, Mitsusuke had to be\r\npardoned and Mochisada ordered to kill himself.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the shogun, Yoshimochi, Mitsusuke fell into fresh\r\ntrouble. The new shogun, Yoshinori, belonged to a very different\r\ncategory of men from his immediate predecessors. He conquered the\r\nKitabatake family in Ise; repressed the remnants of the Southern\r\nCourt league; crushed the military monks by capturing Nara and\r\nHiei-zan; put an end finally to Kamakura's intrigues; obtained\r\ncontrol of the west, and quelled his enemies in all directions. It\r\nnow became his task to bend to his will the overstrong and\r\nover-presumptuous among the concerted families of the Ashikaga.\r\nForemost of these were the Akamatsu, their chief, a man whose\r\npersonality invited contumely. The shogun disliked Mitsusuke, and\r\nfound it an agreeable occupation to slight him. Gradually the\r\nAkamatsu leader became bitterly estranged. Moreover, he saw his\r\nyounger sister executed for disobedience though she was the shogun's\r\nmistress; he saw the nephew of his old enemy, Mochisada, treated with\r\nmarked favour by the Muromachi potentate, and he learned, truly or\r\nuntruly, that his own office of high constable was destined to be\r\nbestowed on this favourite.\r\n\r\nIt was now the time when Kamakura's mischievous potentialities had\r\nbeen finally destroyed, and to commemorate the event, entertainments\r\nin the shogun's honour were organized by the heads of the great\r\nmilitary families. On the 6th of August, 1441, it fell to Akamatsu\r\nMitsusuke to act as his host. So soon as the shogun and his personal\r\nattendants had passed the portals of the Akamatsu mansion, the horses\r\nin the stables were set free as though by accident; the gates were\r\nclosed to prevent the escape of the animals; Yoshinori with his small\r\nretinue, being thus caught in a trap, were butchered; the mansion was\r\nfired, and Mitsusuke with seven hundred followers rode off in broad\r\ndaylight to his castle in Harima, whence, assisted by the monk,\r\nGison, he sent circulars in all directions inciting to revolt. Thus\r\nmiserably perished a ruler whose strong hand, active brain, and\r\nfearless measures, had he been spared a few years longer, might have\r\nsaved his country from some of the terrible suffering she was\r\ndestined to undergo in the century and a half subsequent to his\r\ndeath. He did not live long enough to reach a high place in history.\r\nBut all his measures were designed to make for the eradication of\r\nimmorality and corruption, and for the restoration of law and order\r\nthroughout the country. His fault seems to have been precipitancy. So\r\nmany suffered by his reforms, and in such quick succession, that the\r\nhatred he provoked could scarcely have been kept within control. In\r\nthe matter of finance, too, he resorted, as will be presently seen,\r\nto devices quite irreconcilable with just administration.\r\n\r\nYOSHIKATSU AND YOSHIMASA\r\n\r\nThe murder of Yoshinori left the shogun's office without any\r\ndesignate occupant, but the heads of the great military families lost\r\nno time in electing Yoshikatsu*, the eight-year-old son of Yoshinori,\r\nand at the latter's nominal instance the Emperor ordered him to\r\nattack his father's assassin. The three Yamana chiefs, Mochitoyo\r\n(called also Sozen, or the \"Red Monk,\" one of the ablest captains of\r\nhis country), Noriyuki, and Norikiyo; the Hosokawa chief, Mochitsune;\r\nand Sadamura, representing the Akamatsu family, all joined forces for\r\nthe expedition, and presently an army of fifty thousand men sat down\r\nbefore Shirahata Castle. In October, 1441, the stronghold fell.\r\nMitsusuke perished, and the three provinces he had administered were\r\ntransferred to the Yamana--Harima to Mochitoyo, Mimasaka to Norikiyo,\r\nand Bizen to Noriyuki.\r\n\r\n*To be distinguished from Yoshikazu (shogun 1423-1425), son of\r\nYoshimochi.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, in 1392, the Yamana family was shattered in a\r\nrevolt against the authority of the shogun, Yoshimitsu. We now see\r\nthe fortunes of the family thoroughly rehabilitated. The young\r\nshogun, however, did not long survive the punishment of his father's\r\nmurderers. He died in 1443, at the age of ten, and was succeeded by\r\nhis brother Yoshimasa, then in his eighth year. During the latter's\r\nminority, the administration fell into the hands of Hatakeyama\r\nMochikuni and Hosokawa Katsumoto, who held the office of Muromachi\r\nkwanryo alternately. The country now began to experience the\r\nconsequences of Yoshinori's death before his plans to limit the power\r\nof the great military septs had matured. Disorder became the normal\r\ncondition in the provinces. The island of Kyushu took the lead. There\r\nthe Shoni, the Kikuchi, the Otomo, and the Shiba had always defied a\r\ncentral authority, and now Norishige, a younger brother of the\r\nassassin, Akamatsu Mitsusuke; found among them supporters of a scheme\r\nto restore the fortunes of his house. In the Kwanto partisans of the\r\nlate kwanryo, Mochiuji, raised their heads. In the home provinces the\r\nwarrior-priests of Nara sought to avenge the chastisement they had\r\nsuffered at Yoshinori's hands, and among the immediate entourage of\r\nMuromachi, the Hosokawa, the Hatakeyama, the Shiba, and others\r\nengaged in desperate struggles about questions of succession.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ASHIKAGA YOSHIMASA\r\n\r\nTHE TOKUSEI\r\n\r\nEven when he reached man's estate, Yoshimasa proved wholly\r\nincompetent to deal with these complications. He abandoned himself to\r\ndissipation and left everything, great or small, to be managed by his\r\nwife, Fujiwara Tomiko, and by his consort, Kasuga no Tsubone. Bribery\r\nand corruption were the motive forces of the time. The innocent were\r\npunished; the unworthy rewarded. The shogun remained indifferent\r\neven when his mandates were neglected or contravened. The building\r\nof splendid residences, the laying out of spacious parks, the\r\ngratification of luxurious tastes, and the procuring of funds to\r\ndefray the cost of his vast extravagance--these things occupied his\r\nentire attention.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the Ashikaga shogunate is a financial device known in\r\nhistory as tokusei, a term signifying \"virtuous administration.\"\r\nOriginally imported from China, the tokusei meant nothing more than\r\na temporary remission of taxes in times of distress. But during\r\nthe financial straits to which the country was reduced after the\r\nMongol invasion, the Hojo deemed it necessary to afford relief to\r\nlandowners who had mortgaged their property, and thus, in 1297, a\r\nlaw--tokusei-rei--was enacted, providing that eviction for debt must\r\nnot be enforced. Under the Ashikaga, the tokusei received a still\r\nwider import. It was interpreted as including all debts and pecuniary\r\nobligations of any kind. In other words, the promulgation of a\r\ntokusei ordinance meant that all debtors, then and there, obtained\r\ncomplete relief. The law was not construed exactly alike everywhere.\r\nThus, in Nara a debtor must discharge one-third of his obligation\r\nbefore claiming exemption, and elsewhere a nominal sum had to be paid\r\nfor release. Naturally, legislation so opposed to the fundamental\r\nprinciples of integrity led to flagrant abuses. Forced by riotous\r\nmobs, or constrained by his own needs, the Muromachi shogun issued\r\ntokusei edicts again and again, incurring the hot indignation of the\r\ncreditor class and disturbing the whole economic basis of society.\r\nYoshimasa was conspicuously reckless; he put the tokusei system into\r\nforce thirteen times.\r\n\r\nEXTRAVAGANCE AND INCOMPETENCE OF YOSHIMASA\r\n\r\nIt is stated in the records of the Onin era (1467-1469) that\r\nYoshimasa subordinated his duties altogether to his pleasures, and\r\nthat his thoughts seemed to turn wholly on banquets and fetes. His\r\nfavourites, especially females, had the control of affairs and were\r\nthe final arbiters in all important matters. Thus, a domain which had\r\nbeen in the undisputed possession of a family for generations might\r\nbe alienated in favour of any claimant sufficiently unscrupulous and\r\nsufficiently rich to \"commend\" his title, and a judgment delivered by\r\na court of law in the morning was liable to be reversed in the\r\nevening by the fiat of the ladies in the Muromachi \"palace.\"\r\nStability of policy had no existence. In a period of twenty-four\r\nyears (1444-1468), three sentences each of punishment and pardon were\r\npronounced in the case of the Hatakeyama family, and in twenty years,\r\nYoshikado and Yoshitoshi of the Shiba sept were each punished and\r\npardoned three times. In Kyoto it became a current saying that loyal\r\nacts, not evil deeds, were penalized, and the truth of the comment\r\nfound confirmation in the case of an official, Kumagaya, who was\r\ndismissed from his post and deprived of his property for venturing to\r\nmemorialize the shogun in a critical manner.\r\n\r\nThese same records of the Onin year-period also make clear that one\r\nof the factors chiefly responsible for the disturbance was\r\nYoshimasa's curious lack of sympathy with the burdens of the people.\r\nEven one grand ceremony in the course of from five to six years\r\nsufficed to empty the citizens' pockets. But in Yoshimasa's time\r\nthere Were nine of such fetes in five years, and four of them had no\r\nwarrant whatever except pleasure seeking--as a performance of the\r\nSarugaku mime on an immense scale; a flower-viewing party; an\r\nal-fresco entertainment, and a visit to the cherry blossoms. On each\r\nof these occasions the court officials and the military men had to\r\npawn their estates and sell their heirlooms in order to supply\r\nthemselves with sufficiently gorgeous robes, and the sequel was the\r\nimposition of house taxes and land taxes so heavy that the provincial\r\nfarmers often found vagrancy more lucrative than agricultural\r\nindustry. Pawnshops were mercilessly mulcted. In the days of\r\nYoshimitsu, they were taxed at each of the four seasons; in\r\nYoshinori's time the same imposts were levied once a month, and under\r\nYoshimasa's rule the pawnbrokers had to pay nine times in November,\r\n1466, and eight times in December of the same year.\r\n\r\nEven after full allowance has been made for exaggeration, natural in\r\nthe presence of such extravagance, there remains enough to convict\r\nYoshimasa of something like a mania for luxury. He built for himself\r\na residence so splendid that it went by the name of the Palace of\r\nFlowers (Hana no Gosho) and of materials so costly that the outlay\r\ntotalled six hundred thousand strings of cash;* and he built for his\r\nmother, Shigeko, a mansion concerning which it is recorded that two\r\nof the sliding doors for the interior cost twenty thousand strings.**\r\nYet at times this same Yoshimasa was reduced to such straits for\r\nmoney that we read of him borrowing five hundred \"strings\" on the\r\nsecurity of his armour, to pay for a parturition chamber.\r\n\r\n*£4,500,000--$22,000,000.\r\n\r\n**£150,000--$7,300,000.\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Flowers came into existence in 1459, just on the eve of\r\na period of natural calamities which culminated in famine and\r\npestilence. In 1462, these conditions were at their worst. From\r\nvarious, provinces people flocked to the capital seeking food, and\r\ndeaths from starvation became frequent in the city. A Buddhist\r\npriest, Gwana, constructed grass huts to which the famished sufferers\r\nwere carried on bamboo stretchers to be fed with soft, boiled millet.\r\nIt is recorded that, during the first two months of 1462, the number\r\nof persons thus relieved totalled eighty-two thousand. Another\r\nBuddhist priest erected a monument to the dead found in the bed of\r\nthe river below the bridge, Gojo. They aggregated twelve hundred.\r\nScores of corpses received no burial, and the atmosphere of the city\r\nwas pervaded with a shocking effluvium.\r\n\r\nBut even the presence of these horrors does not seem to have sobered\r\nthe Muromachi profligate. The costly edifices were pushed on and the\r\npeople's resources continued to be squandered. Even the Emperor,\r\nGo-Hanazono, was sufficiently shocked to compose a couplet indirectly\r\ncensuring Yoshimasa, and a momentary sense of shame visited the\r\nsybarite. But only momentary. We find him presently constructing in\r\nthe mansion of his favourite retainer, Ise Sadachika, a bath-house\r\nwhich was the wonder of the time, a bath-house where the bathers were\r\nexpected to come robed in the most magnificent costumes. One of the\r\nedifices that formed part of his palace after his retirement from\r\nactive life, in 1474, was a \"Silver Pavilion\" intended to rival the\r\n\"Golden Pavilion\" of his ancestor, Yoshimitsu. During the last\r\nsixteen years of his life--he died in 1490--he patronized art with a\r\ndegree of liberality that atones for much of his previous profligacy.\r\nIn the halls of the Jisho-ji monastery, constructed on a grand scale\r\nas his retreat in old age, he collected chefs d'oeuvre of China and\r\nJapan, so that the district Higashi-yama where the building stood\r\nbecame to all ages a synonym for choice specimens, and there, too, he\r\ninstituted the tea ceremonial whose votaries were thenceforth\r\nrecognized as the nation's arbitri elegantiarum. Landscape gardens\r\nalso occupied his attention. Wherever, in province or in capital, in\r\nshrine, in temple, in private house, or in official residence, any\r\nquaintly shaped rock or picturesque tree was found, it was\r\nimmediately requisitioned for the park of Higashi-yama-dono, as men\r\nthen called Yoshimasa, and under the direction of a trio of great\r\nartists, So-ami, Gei-ami, and No-ami, there grew up a plaisance of\r\nunprecedented beauty, concerning which a poet of the time wrote that\r\n\"every breeze coming thence wafted the perfume of tea.\" The pastimes\r\nof \"listening to incense,\" of floral arrangement, of the dramatic\r\nmime, and of the parlour farce were all practised with a zest which\r\nprovoked the astonishment even of contemporary annalists.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: A PICNIC DURING THE FLOWER SEASON IN THE ASHIKAGA PERIOD\r\n\r\nAll this contributed materially to educate the nation's artistic\r\nfaculties, but the cost was enormous and the burden of taxation\r\ncorrespondingly heavy. It was under this financial pressure that\r\nYoshimasa approached the Ming emperor seeking pecuniary aid. Thrice\r\nthe shogun's applications were successful, and the amounts thus\r\nobtained are said to have totalled three hundred thousand strings of\r\ncash (equivalent of £450,000, or $2,200,000). His requests are said\r\nto have assumed the guise of appeals in behalf of famine-stricken\r\npeople, but there is no evidence that any of the presents were\r\ndevoted to that purpose. Partial apologists for Yoshimasa's\r\ninfatuation are not wanting. Thus, it is alleged that he was weary of\r\nfailure to reform the administration; that the corruption and\r\nconfusion of society induced him to seek consolation in art; that\r\noutside the precincts of his palace he was restrained by the\r\nprovincial magnates, and inside he had to obey the dictation of his\r\nwife, Tomi, of her brother, Katsumitsu, and of his own favourite\r\npage, Ise Sadachika, so that only in his tea reunions and his private\r\ntheatricals could a semblance of independence be obtained; that his\r\norders were not obeyed or his injunctions respected by any save the\r\nartists he had gathered around him, and that in gratifying his\r\nluxurious tastes, he followed the example of his grandfather,\r\nYoshimitsu. But such exculpations amount to saying that he was an\r\nessentially weak man, the slave of his surroundings.\r\n\r\nTHE KWANTO TUMULT\r\n\r\nThe lawlessness of the time and the indifference with which the\r\nshogun's mandates were treated find illustration in the story of the\r\nKwanto. When (1439) Mochiuji perished, the only member of his family\r\nthat survived was his five-year-old son, Shigeuji. This child placed\r\nhimself under the protection of Muromachi. It will be remembered that\r\nUesugi Norizane, lamenting his unwilling share in Mochiuji's\r\ndestruction, had entered religion. His son, Noritada, was then\r\nappointed to act as manager (shitsuji) to Shigeuji, his colleague\r\nbeing Uesugi Akifusa (Ogigayatsu Uesugi). But the Yuki family, who\r\nhad given shelter to two sons of Mochiuji, objected to bow their\r\nheads to the Uesugi, and persuaded Shigeuji to have Noritada killed.\r\nTherefore, the partisans of the murdered man placed themselves under\r\nthe banner of his brother, Fusaaki, and having received a commission\r\nfrom Muromachi as well as a powerful contingent of troops under\r\nImagawa Noritada, they marched in great force against Kamakura from\r\nKotsuke, Kazusa, and Echigo.\r\n\r\nKamakurawas well-nigh reduced to ruins, but Shigeuji retired to the\r\nfortress of Koga in Shimosa, and his cause against the Uesugi was\r\nespoused by the eight families of Chiba, Koyama, Satomi, Satake, Oda,\r\nYuki, Utsunomiya, and Nasu, thenceforth known as the \"eight generals\"\r\nof the Kwanto. Against such a league it was difficult to operate\r\nsuccessfully. Masatomo, a younger brother of Yoshimasa, built for\r\nhimself a fortress at Horigoe, in Izu, which was thereafter known as\r\nHorigoe Gosho (the Horigoe Palace), Shigeuji in his castle of Koga\r\nbeing designated Koga Kuba (the Koga shogun). Castle building\r\nacquired from this time greatly increased vogue. Uesugi Mochitomo\r\nfortified Kawagoe in Musashi; Ota Sukenaga (called also Dokan), a\r\nvassal of the Ogigayatsu Uesugi, built at Yedo a fort destined to\r\nhave world-wide celebrity, and his father, Sukekiyo, entrenched\r\nIwatsuki in the same province of Musashi. Thus the Kwanto became the\r\narena of warring factions.\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE ONIN WAR\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at a chapter of Japanese history infinitely perplexing\r\nto the reader. It is generally called the Onin War because the\r\nstruggle described commenced in the year-period of that name, but\r\nwhereas the Onin period lasted only two years (1467-1469), the Onin\r\nWar continued for eleven years and caused shocking destruction of\r\nlife and property. When war is spoken of, the mind naturally\r\nconjectures a struggle between two or perhaps three powers for a\r\ncause that is respectable from some points of view. But in the Onin\r\nWar a score of combatants were engaged, and the motive was invariably\r\npersonal ambition. It has been described above that when the Ashikaga\r\nchief, Takauji, undertook to re-establish the Minamoto Bakufu, he\r\nessayed to overcome opposition by persuasion rather than by force.\r\nPursuing that policy, he bestowed immense estates upon those that\r\nyielded to him, so that in time there came into existence holders of\r\nlands more extensive than those belonging to the shogun himself.\r\nThus, while the landed estates of the Muromachi shogun measured only\r\n15,798 cho* there were no less than eight daimyo more richly endowed.\r\nThey were:\r\n\r\n*A cho at that time represented 3 acres. It is now 2.5 acres.\r\n\r\n   Daimyo                    Area of Estates in cho (3 acres)\r\n\r\n   (1) Yanada Takasuke        32,083\r\n\r\n   (2) Uesugi Akisada         27,239\r\n\r\n   (3) Ouchi Mochiyo          25,435\r\n\r\n   (4) Hosokawa Katsumoto     24,465\r\n\r\n   (5) Shiba Mochitane        23,576\r\n\r\n   (6) Sasaki Takayori        16,872\r\n\r\n   (7) Hatakeyama Yoshmari    16,801\r\n\r\n   (8) Sasaki Mochikiyo       16,725\r\n\r\nIf we examine the list still more minutely, we find no less than\r\ntwenty-two families, each of whose estates was equal to, or larger\r\nthan, one-half of the Muromachi manors. Some families consisted of\r\nseveral branches whose aggregate properties represented an immense\r\narea. This was notably the case of the Yamana; their five branches\r\nheld lands totalling 45,788 cho. The owners of such estates must not\r\nbe confounded with the high constables (shugo). Thus Yamana Sozen, as\r\nthe high constable of Harima province, held administrative authority\r\nin fourteen districts covering an area of 10,414 cho, and if to this\r\nbe added the expanse of his fief, namely, 8016 cho, we get a total\r\nnearly equal to the manors of Hosokawa Katsumoto. Again, Shiba\r\nYoshitoshi, in addition to owning 10,816 cho, officiated as tandai of\r\nKyushu, which gave him jurisdiction over another extent of 106,553\r\ncho, though it is true that his authority was defied in the provinces\r\nof Satsuma and Osumi. The military owner of one of these great\r\nestates levied a revenue on a scale which will be presently\r\ndiscussed, but the high constable was nominally empowered to collect\r\nand transmit only such taxes as were payable to the Bakufu, namely,\r\nthe \"military dues\" (buke-yaku) and the \"farmers' dues\"\r\n(hyakusho-yaku), whereof the former were originally assessed at two\r\nper cent., and subsequently raised to five per cent., of a family\r\nincome; and the latter varied from one to two per cent, of a\r\nhomestead's earnings. So long as a high constable or a tandai was\r\nloyal to the Bakufu, the latter received the appointed quota of\r\nimposts; but in times of insurrection, the shugo or tandai\r\nappropriated to his own purposes the proceeds alike of the buke-yaku\r\nand the hyakusho-yaku.\r\n\r\nNot merely inequalities of wealth operated to produce political\r\nunrest. It has also to be noted that each great military family\r\nsupported a body of armed retainers whose services were at all times\r\navailable; further, we must remember that the long War of the\r\nDynasties had educated a wide-spread spirit of fighting, which the\r\ndebility of the Ashikaga Bakufu encouraged to action. The Onin\r\ndisturbance had its origin in disputes about inheritance. It has been\r\nrecorded that the high post of kwanryo (governor-general) in the\r\nMuromachi polity was filled by a member of one of three families, the\r\nHosokawa, the Hatakeyama, and the Shiba. The Hosokawa were the most\r\npowerful, and had for representative in the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury an administrator, Katsumoto, who to extensive erudition and a\r\nprofound knowledge of medicine added very exceptional gifts of\r\nstatecraft and organizing ability. The Hatakeyama had for head\r\nMochikuni, called also Tokuhon, a man of parts; and it happened that\r\nthe rival family of Yamana was led by Mochitoyo, or Sozen, who, on\r\naccount of his powerful physique, shaved head, and peculiar\r\ncomplexion, sometimes received the name of the \"Red Monk\"\r\n(Aka-nyudo).\r\n\r\nTokuhon being without a legitimate son, adopted his nephew, Masanaga,\r\nbut subsequently desired to secure the succession to Yoshinari, a son\r\nborne to him by a concubine. This change was not viewed with\r\nequanimity by all the vassals of Tokuhon, and to solve the problem\r\nthe latter appealed to the shogun, Yoshimasa, who authorized the\r\ndeath of Masanaga. Tokuhon, in his capacity of kwanryo, naturally had\r\nmuch weight with the shogun, but Yoshimasa's conduct on that occasion\r\nmust be attributed mainly to a laisser-aller mood which he had then\r\ndeveloped, and which impelled him to follow the example set by the\r\nImperial Court in earlier times by leaving the military families in\r\nthe provinces to fight their own battles. Masanaga sought succour\r\nfrom Hosokawa Katsumoto, and that magnate, welcoming the opportunity\r\nof avenging an old injury at the hands of the Hatakeyama, laid siege\r\nto the mansion of Tokuhon, who barely escaped with his life, his son,\r\nYoshinari, fleeing to the fortress of Wakae, in Kawachi, whence he\r\nwas presently driven by the forces of Katsumoto and Sozen, then\r\nacting in conjunction but destined afterwards to become bitter\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe shogun, true to his complacent policy, now recognized Masanaga as\r\nhead of the house of Hatakeyama, Tokuhon having just died (1455). But\r\nYoshinari did not acquiesce. In 1456, he marched with a Kawachi army\r\nagainst Masanaga, and a deadly struggle was barely prevented by the\r\nintervention of the shogun. Thenceforth, the Hatakeyama became\r\ndivided into two families, Masanaga's branch being the more powerful,\r\nbut Yoshinari obtaining favour at Muromachi and being nominated\r\nkwanryo. Owing, however, to some petty causes, the shogun's good-will\r\nwas subsequently estranged, and Yoshinari had to flee from Kyoto,\r\npursued by Masanaga, who now held a commission from Muromachi to kill\r\nhim. A seven-years' fight (1460-1467) ensued in Kawachi and Yamato.\r\nYoshinari displayed greatly superior skill as a strategist, and\r\nfinally Yamana Sozen, who had always entertained a good opinion of\r\nhim even while opposing his succession at the outset, openly espoused\r\nYoshinari's cause. The immediate result was that Masanaga, who had\r\nbeen named kwanryo in 1464, had to give way to SOzen's nominee, Shiba\r\nYoshikado, and found himself in deadly peril.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to recall the murder of the shogun Yoshinori, in\r\n1441. That crime had resulted in the fall of the Akamatsu family, the\r\ndirect agent of its overthrow being the united forces of Hosokawa,\r\nTakeda, and Yamana. There were no bonds of genuine friendship between\r\nthe Hosokawa chief, Katsumoto, and Yamana Sozen. Their union was\r\nprimarily due to Katsumoto's ambition. He desired to break the power\r\nof Hatakeyama Tokuhon, and with that ultimate object he courted the\r\nalliance of Sozen, giving his own daughter to the latter in marriage\r\nand himself adopting Sozen's son, Koretoyo. Thus, the two chiefs were\r\nsubsequently found acting together against Tokuhon's attempt to\r\nsubstitute his son, albeit illegitimate, for his nephew, as heir to\r\nthe Hatakeyama estates. Neither Katsumoto nor Sozen cared anything\r\nabout the succession itself. Their object was simply to crush the\r\nHatakeyama; and Sozen, who never relied on argument where force was\r\napplicable, lost no time in attacking Tokuhon and driving him from\r\nhis burning mansion, as has been already stated. From the legal\r\nconsequences of that violence, Sozen was saved by Katsumoto's\r\nintercession at Muromachi, and the alliance (1454) between the\r\nHosokawa and the Yamana seemed stronger than ever. But Sozen did not\r\ngreatly trust his crafty ally, with whose gifts of political strategy\r\nhe was well acquainted. He suspected Katsumoto of a design to restore\r\nthe fortunes of the once powerful Akamatsu family, and he began to\r\nmuster forces for the great struggle which he anticipated. Therefore\r\nit was that, in 1467, as shown above, he not only espoused the cause\r\nof Hatakeyama Yoshinari, in whom he recognized an able captain, but\r\nalso championed Shiba Yoshikado.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this latter, it is necessary to recognize that he also\r\nfigured in a succession dispute. The great family of Shiba being\r\nwithout a direct heir, a relative was appointed to the headship in\r\n1452. This successor, Yoshitoshi, attempting to enforce the\r\nacquiescence of one of his vassals, was defeated and became a\r\nfugitive, a successor, Yoshikado, being nominated by the Shiba\r\nvassals. But a sister of the fugitive subsequently married the\r\nshogun's favourite, Ise Sadachika, and through her influence the\r\nshogun was induced (1466) to recall Yoshitoshi and to declare him\r\nrightful head of the Shiba family. Yamana Sozen, who had given his\r\ndaughter in marriage to Yoshitoshi's rival, Yoshikado, immediately\r\nset a powerful army in motion for Kyoto, and the alarmed shogun\r\n(Yoshimasa) not only recognized Yoshikado and drove out Yoshitoshi,\r\nbut also nominated the former to be kwanryo.\r\n\r\nFrom this grievously complicated story the facts which emerge\r\nessentially and conspicuously are: first, that Yamana Sozen now\r\noccupied the position of champion to representatives of the two great\r\nfamilies of Hatakeyama and Shiba; secondly, that the rival successors\r\nof these families looked to Hosokawa Katsumoto for aid; thirdly, that\r\nthe relations between Sozen and Katsumoto had become very strained,\r\nand fourthly, that the issue at stake in every case was never more\r\nlofty than personal ambition.. The succession to the shogunate also\r\nwas in dispute. Yoshimasa, being childless, desired to adopt as his\r\nheir his younger brother who had entered religion under the name of\r\nGijin. The latter declined the honour until Yoshimasa swore that were\r\na son subsequently born to him, it should be made a priest but never\r\na shogun. Gijin then took the name of Yoshimi, and was for a time\r\nrecognized as heir-apparent, Hosokawa Katsumoto being appointed\r\nmanager (shitsuji). Presently, however, the shogun's consort, Tomi,\r\ngave birth to a boy, Yoshihisa, and the mother persuaded Yoshimasa to\r\ncontrive that her son should supplant the sometime priest. Of\r\nnecessity, the aid of Sozen was sought to accomplish this scheme,\r\nKatsumoto being already officially attached to Yoshimi. The Yamana\r\nchief readily assented, and thus the situation received its final\r\nelement, a claimant whose right rested on a deliberately violated\r\noath.\r\n\r\nTHE ONIN WAR\r\n\r\nBy the close of 1466, the two great protagonists, Katsumoto and\r\nSozen, had quietly collected in Kyoto armies estimated at 160,000 and\r\n110,000 men, respectively. The shogun attempted to limit the area of\r\ndisturbance by ordering that the various rival inheritors should be\r\nleft to fight their own battles, and by announcing that whoever\r\nstruck the first blow in their behalf would be proclaimed a rebel.\r\nSuch injunctions were powerless, however, to restrain men like Sozen.\r\nIn February, 1467, his followers attacked the former kwanryo,\r\nHatakeyama Masanaga, and drove him from the capital. Katsumoto made\r\nno move, however; he remained on the watch, confident that thus the\r\nlegitimacy of his cause would obtain recognition. In fact, the shogun\r\nwas actually under guard of the Hosokawa troops, who, being encamped\r\non the east and north of Muromachi, received the name of the Eastern\r\nArmy; the Yamana forces, which were massed on the west and south,\r\nbeing distinguished as the Western Army.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that if either side retreated, the other would\r\nperforce be acknowledged by the Bakufu, and both were reluctant to\r\nput their fortunes to the final test. At length, early in July, 1467,\r\na petty skirmish precipitated a general engagement. It was\r\ninconclusive, and the attitude of mutual observation was resumed. Two\r\nmonths later re-enforcements reached the Western Army, and\r\nthereafter, for nearly two years, victory rested with the Yamana. But\r\nKatsumoto clung desperately to his position. Kyoto was reduced almost\r\ncompletely to ruins, the Imperial palace, Buddhist temples, and other\r\nmansions being laid in ashes, countless rare works of art being\r\ndestroyed, and the Court nobles and other civil officials being\r\ncompelled to flee to the provinces for shelter. A celebrated poet of\r\nthe time said that the evening lark soared over moors where formerly\r\nthere had been palaces, and in the Onin Records it is stated that the\r\nmetropolis became a den for foxes and wolves, and that Imperial\r\nmandates and religious doctrines were alike unheeded.\r\n\r\nAt one time things looked as though the ultimate triumph must be with\r\nSozen. But what Katsumoto lacked in military ability he more than\r\ncompensated in statecraft. From the outset he took care to legalize\r\nhis cause by inducing the Emperor and the ex-Emperor to remove to\r\nMuromachi, where they were guarded by the Hosokawa troops, and the\r\ndefections to which this must ultimately expose Sozen's ranks were\r\nsupplemented by fomenting in the domains of the Yamana and their\r\nallies intrigues which necessitated a diversion of strength from the\r\nKyoto campaign. Curious and intricate was the attitude of the\r\nHosokawa towards the rival aspirants to the shogunate. Sozen's aid,\r\nas related above, had originally been invoked and exercised in behalf\r\nof Yoshimasa, the shogun's son by the lady Tomi.\r\n\r\nHence, it is not surprising to find the Yamana leader turning his\r\nback upon the sometime bonze, Yoshimi, in October, 1469. But it is\r\nsurprising to see him openly espouse this same Yoshimi's cause two\r\nmonths later. The fact was that Sozen might not choose. He had been\r\noutmanoeuvered by his astute opponent, who now held complete control\r\nof the shogun, and who not only obtained an Imperial decree depriving\r\nYoshimi of his offices, but also contrived that, early in 1469, the\r\nlady Tomi's four-year-old son, Yoshihisa, should be officially\r\ndeclared heir to the shogunate. In this matter, Katsumoto's\r\nvolte-face had been nearly as signal as Sozen's, for the former was\r\nYoshimi's champion at the beginning. Henceforth the war assumed the\r\ncharacter of a struggle for the succession to the shogunate. The\r\ncrude diplomacy of the Yamana leader was unable to devise any\r\neffective reply to the spectacular pageant of two sovereigns, a\r\nshogun, and a duly-elected heir to the shogunate all marshalled on\r\nthe Hosokawa side. Nothing better was conceived than a revival of the\r\nSouthern dynasty, which had ceased to be an active factor\r\nseventy-eight years previously. But this farce did little service to\r\nthe cause of the Yamana. By degrees the hostile forces withdrew from\r\nthe capital, of which the western half (called Saikyo) alone remained\r\nintact, and the strategy of the hostile leaders became concerned\r\nchiefly about preserving their own commissariat or depriving the\r\nenemy of his.\r\n\r\nIn 1472, a new feature was introduced: Hatakeyama joined the Eastern\r\nArmy by order of the shogun, Yoshimasa. This was not merely a great\r\naccession of numerical strength, it also opened the road to the north\r\nwhere the Hatakeyama estates lay, and thus the Eastern Army found a\r\nsolution of the problem which dominated the situation at Kyoto--the\r\nproblem of provisions. The scale of success now swung in the\r\ndirection of Hosokawa and his allies. But still no crushing victory\r\nwas won, and meanwhile the war had continued seven years, with\r\nimmense loss of life and treasure. There is evidence that alike\r\nKatsumoto and Sozen were fain to sheathe the sword in 1472, but\r\nduring the long struggle conditions had developed which rendered\r\npeace difficult. In May, 1473, Sozen died and was followed to the\r\ngrave in less than a month by Katsumoto. Still the struggle went on\r\nin a desultory way until December, 1477, when the Yamana forces\r\nburned their cantonments and withdrew, Yoshimi coming to terms with\r\nMuromachi and retiring to Mino. Peace at length dawned for Kyoto. But\r\nnot yet for the provinces. There the sword was not immediately\r\nsheathed. In Echizen, Owari, and Totomi the great Shiba family was\r\nsubjected to weakening onsets by the Asakura, the Oda, and the\r\nImagawa. In Kaga, the Togashi house was divided against itself. In\r\nKyushu there were bitter struggles between the Shimazu and the Ito,\r\nthe Sagara and the Nawa, and the Otomo, the Shoni, and the Ouchi.\r\nFinally, Shinano, Suruga, and Mikawa were all more or less convulsed.\r\n\r\nYOSHIHISA\r\n\r\nIn 1474, Yoshimasa retired from office and, at the close of the year,\r\nhis nine-year-old son, Yoshihisa, succeeded him as shogun, the\r\nkwanryo being that Hatakeyama Yoshinari whose appearance in the field\r\npractically terminated the Onin War. The shogun Yoshimasa was in his\r\nthirty-ninth year at the time of this abdication, and he survived for\r\nsixteen years, not the least dissipated of his life, in which he\r\ninstituted costly art reunions and carried self-indulgence to its\r\nextreme. During these years Tomi and her younger brother, Ise\r\nSadachika, acquired such influence as to interfere in the\r\nadministration, and under the pretext of procuring funds to rebuild\r\nthe palace destroyed during the Onin War, they restored the\r\ntoll-gates which had previously stood at the seven chief entrances to\r\nKyoto, appropriating all the proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe young Yoshihisa could scarcely fail to be tainted by such an\r\nenvironment. Much to his credit, however, he showed sagacity and\r\ndiligence, eschewing his father's luxurious habits, studying\r\nliterature and military art, and taking lessons in statecraft from\r\nthe ex-regent, Ichijo Kaneyoshi. Very early he became familiar with\r\nscenes of violence, for, goaded to madness by the taxes exacted at\r\nthe seven toll-gates, a mob of the metropolitan citizens rose in\r\narms, beat off the troops sent to quell them and threatened to sack\r\nthe city, when, they were appeased by the issue of a tokusei\r\nordinance, which, as already explained, meant the remission of all\r\ndebts and the cancellation of all financial obligations. Socialism in\r\nsuch a genial form appealed not only to the masses but also to bushi\r\nwho had pledged their property as security for loans to meet warlike\r\noutlays or the demands of luxurious extravagance.\r\n\r\nAlike in the home provinces and in distant Kaga, Noto, Etchu, and the\r\nsouth, tokusei riots took place. Notably incompatible with any\r\nefficient exercise of Muromachi authority was the independence which\r\nthe provincial magnates had now learned to display. They levied what\r\ntaxes they pleased; employed the proceeds as seemed good to them;\r\nenacted and administered their own laws; made war or peace as they\r\nwished, and granted estates or revenues to their vassals at will. In\r\nshort, the bushi had gradually constructed for themselves a full suit\r\nof feudal garments, and to bring them once again under the effective\r\ncontrol of the sovereign or the shogun was almost a hopeless task.\r\nYoshihisa might perhaps have refrained from attempting it had the\r\nempire been at peace. But, in truth, the empire was on the threshold\r\nof a century-long struggle compared with which the Onin War proved a\r\nbagatelle. The mutterings of the coming storm made themselves very\r\naudible during the years of Yoshihisa's early manhood. The Uesugi\r\nsepts, and the Hojo and the Satomi, were fighting in the Kwanto; the\r\nwestern provinces, the central provinces, and Kyushu were the scenes\r\nof constant conflicts, and no prospect of tranquillity presented\r\nitself. Yoshihisa determined to undertake the work of subjugating the\r\nwhole country as Yoritomo had done effectually and as Takauji had\r\ndone partially. But he died in his twenty-fifth year when engaged in\r\nconducting a campaign against the Rokkaku branch of the Sasaki\r\nfamily, in Omi province; a campaign which but for his death would\r\ncertainly have been successful.\r\n\r\nYOSHITANE\r\n\r\nYoshihisa, whose death took place in 1489, left no son, and his\r\nfather, the ex-shogun Yoshimasa, made tardy atonement to his brother,\r\nYoshimi, the sometime priest, by obtaining the high office of shogun\r\nfor the latter's son, Yoshitane, a youth of twenty-five. In the\r\nfollowing year Yoshimasa died, and, two years later (1492), Yoshitane\r\nplaced himself at the head of an army to resume the Omi campaign\r\nwhich Yoshihisa's death had interrupted. His opponent was of Minamoto\r\nlineage, head of the Rokkaku branch of the Sasaki family, whose\r\nrepresentative in the days of the Kamakura Bakufu had been high\r\nconstable of four provinces, Omi, Izumo, Aki, and Iwami.\r\n\r\nThat the shogun, Yoshihisa, and his successor, Yoshitane, turned\r\ntheir weapons so resolutely against this magnate was due to a cause\r\nillustrative of the abuses of the era. From the outset the Ashikaga\r\nsway over the provinces had been a vanishing quantity, and had\r\ndisappeared almost entirely during the Onin War. Not alone did the\r\nwrit of the sovereign or the shogun cease to run in regions outside\r\nKyoto and its immediate vicinity, but also the taxes, though duly\r\ncollected, did not find their way to the coffers of either Muromachi\r\nor the Court. Shugo there still existed, and jito and kokushi; but\r\nneither high constable nor land-steward nor civil governor acted as\r\npractical representative of any Central Government: each functioned\r\nfor his own hand, swallowing up for his own use, or for inclusion in\r\nsome local fief, the manors which had once been the property of the\r\nState or of the Court nobility.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently of prime necessity from the Muromachi point of view\r\nthat a state of affairs which crippled the shogun by impoverishing\r\nhim should be remedied. Sasaki Takayori, head of the Rokkaku house,\r\nwas a conspicuous product of his time. He had seized the manors of\r\nnearly fifty landowners in the province of Omi, and to punish his\r\naggressions signally would furnish a useful object lesson. That was\r\ndone effectually by Yoshitane's generals, and Sasaki had to flee from\r\nOmi. But the young shogun's triumph was short lived. He allowed\r\nhimself to be drawn by Hatakeyama Masanaga into a private feud. We\r\nhave already seen this Masanaga engaged with Yoshinari in a struggle\r\nfor the Hatakeyama succession on the eve of the Onin War. Yoshinari\r\nwas no longer alive, but he had bequeathed to his son, Yoshitoyo, a\r\nheritage of resentment against Masanaga, and the latter, who now held\r\nthe post of kwanryo for the fourth time, induced the shogun to order\r\nan attack upon Yoshitoyo in the provinces of Kii and Kawachi. But\r\nYoshitoyo managed to enlist the aid of the recently discomfited\r\nSasaki, of the soldier-monks of Kofuku-ji, and, above all, of\r\nHosokawa Masamoto, son of Hatakeyama Masanaga's old opponent,\r\nHosokawa Katsumoto. With these co-operated the Yamana, the Isshiki,\r\nand other septs, so that Yoshitane found himself between two powerful\r\narmies, one in Kyoto, the other in Kii. In the sequel, Masanaga\r\ncommitted suicide, and the shogun, Yoshitane, escaped to Suwo.\r\n\r\nYOSHIZUMI AND YOSHIHARU\r\n\r\nHosokawa Masamoto was now master of the situation in Kyoto. It was\r\nfor him to nominate a new shogun in lieu of the fugitive Yoshitane.\r\nHe went to the Kwanto for a candidate. In 1461, Masatomo, brother of\r\nYoshimasa, had been nominated governor-general (kwanryo) of the eight\r\neastern provinces. His son, Yoshizumi, was chosen by Hosokawa to rule\r\nat Muromachi, and Hosokawa himself became kwanryo. The new shogun\r\nheld office in name only; all administrative power was usurped by the\r\nkwanryo and his nominees. Now, as Hosokawa Masamoto practised\r\nasceticism for the better pursuit of necromancy, in which he was a\r\nbeliever, he had no offspring. Therefore he adopted three sons: the\r\nfirst, Sumiyuki, being the child of the regent, Fujiwara Masamoto;\r\nthe second and third, Sumimoto and Takakuni, being kinsmen of his\r\nown. The first of these three was entrusted to Kasai Motochika; the\r\nlast two were placed in the care of Miyoshi Nagateru. These guardians\r\nwere Hosokawa's principal vassals in Shikoku, where they presently\r\nbecame deadly rivals. Motochika, believing that Hosokawa's ultimate\r\nintention was to elevate Sumimoto to the shogunate, in which event\r\nthe latter's guardian, Nagateru, would obtain a large access of\r\npower, compassed the murder of Hosokawa, the kwanryo, and proclaimed\r\nSumiyuki head of the Hosokawa house. Thereupon Miyoshi Nagateru moved\r\nup from Shikoku at the head of a strong army, and, after a fierce\r\nconflict, Motochika and Sumiyuki were killed, and Sumimoto, then in\r\nhis eleventh year, became chief of the Hosokawa family, receiving\r\nalso the office of kwanryo.\r\n\r\nThe Motochika faction, however, though defeated, were not destroyed.\r\nThey conceived the plan of reinstating the shogun, Yoshitane, then a\r\nfugitive in the province of Suwo, and of securing the office of\r\nkwanryo for Takakuni, third son (by adoption) of the late Hosokawa\r\nMasamoto. The powerful Ouchi sept, which had its manors in Suwo,\r\nespoused the conspiracy, and escorted Yoshitane to Kyoto with a great\r\narmy, the result being that the shogun, Yoshizumi, had to flee to\r\nOmi; that Yoshitane took his place, and that Ouchi Yoshioki became\r\ndeputy kwanryo.\r\n\r\nThese things happened in 1508. Thenceforth, the great protagonists in\r\nthe Kyoto arena were the two factions of the Hosokawa house, led by\r\nSumimoto and Takakuni, respectively; the former championing the cause\r\nof the shogun, Yoshizumi, and in alliance with the Miyoshi; the\r\nlatter supporting the shogun, Yoshitane, and aided by the Ouchi. One\r\nreverse befell the Yoshitane-Ouchi combination, but they quickly\r\nrecovered from it, and from 1508 until 1518 a gleam of peace and\r\nprosperity shone once more in Kyoto under the administration of Ouchi\r\nYoshioki, who governed with skill and impartiality, and whose\r\ninfluence seemed likely to restore the best days of the Bakufu. But,\r\nin 1518, he was recalled to his province by an attack from the shugo\r\nof Izumo, and by financial embarrassment resulting from his own\r\ngenerosity in supplying funds to the Crown and the shogun.\r\n\r\nHosokawa Takakuni now became kwanryo, exercising his authority with a\r\nhigh hand. Then the Sumimoto branch of the Hosokawa, taking advantage\r\nof Ouchi's absence, mustered a force in Shikoku and moved against\r\nKyoto. Takakuni found himself in a difficult position. In the capital\r\nhis overbearing conduct had alienated the shogun, Yoshitane, and from\r\nthe south a hostile army was approaching. He chose Hyogo for\r\nbattle-field, and, after a stout fight, was discomfited and fled to\r\nOmi, the position of kwanryo being bestowed on his rival, Sumimoto,\r\nby the shogun. In a few months, however, Takakuni, in alliance with\r\nthe Rokkaku branch of the Sasaki family under Sadayori, marched into\r\nKyoto in overwhelming force. Miyoshi Nagateru retired to Chion-in,\r\nwhere he committed suicide; Sumimoto fled to Awa, dying there a few\r\nmonths later, and Yoshitane, after brief refuge in the island of\r\nAwaji, died in Awa, in 1523. Thus, Hosokawa Takakuni found himself\r\nsupreme in Kyoto, and he proceeded to appoint a shogun, without\r\nawaiting the demise of Yoshitane. Yoshizumi, the eleventh shogun,\r\nwho, as related above, fled from Kyoto in 1508, dying three years\r\nlater in exile, left two sons: Yoshiharu, whom he committed to the\r\ncharge of Akamatsu Yoshimura, and Yoshikore, whom he entrusted to\r\nHosokawa Sumimoto. In 1521, Takakuni invited Yoshiharu, then eleven\r\nyears old, to the capital and procured his nomination to the\r\nshogunate.\r\n\r\nANARCHY\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the confusion grows worse confounded. The\r\nMiyoshi of Awa are found in co-operation with Yanamoto Kataharu\r\nespousing the cause of the shogun's younger brother, Yoshikore, and\r\nof Harumoto, a son of Hosokawa Sumimoto. We see this combination\r\nexpelling Yoshiharu and Takakuni from Kyoto, and we see the fugitives\r\nvainly essaying to reverse the situation. Thereafter, during several\r\nyears, there is practically no government in the capital. Riot and\r\ninsurrection are daily features, and brigandage prevails unchecked.\r\nKataharu, though not holding the office of kwanryo, usurps its\r\nfunctions so ostentatiously that the assassin's dagger is turned\r\nagainst him. Again the two Hosokawa chiefs, Takakuni and Harumoto,\r\nfight for power, and, in 1531, Takakuni is killed, Harumoto becoming\r\nsupreme. Soon the Miyoshi brothers, Motonaga and Masanaga, engage in\r\na fierce quarrel about their inheritance, and the former, with\r\nYoshikore as candidate for the shogunate and Hatakeyama as auxiliary,\r\nraises the standard against Harumoto, who, aided by the\r\nsoldier-priests of Hongwan-ji, kills both Yoshitaka and Motonaga and\r\ntakes Yoshikore prisoner. Thereafter, Harumoto quarrels with the\r\nHongwan-ji bonzes, and being attacked by them, obtains the aid of\r\nRokkaku Sadayori and the Nichiren priests, with the result that the\r\nsplendid fane of Hongwan-ji is reduced to ashes. A reconciliation is\r\nthen effected between Harumoto and the shogun, Yoshiharu, while\r\nMiyoshi Masanaga is appointed to high office. Yet once more the\r\nuntiring Takakuni, aided by Miyoshi Norinaga, Motonaga's son, called\r\nalso Chokei, drives Yoshiharu and Harumoto from the metropolis, and\r\npresently a reconciliation is effected by the good offices of Rokkaku\r\nSadayori, the real power of the kwanryo being thenceforth exercised\r\nby the Miyoshi family. Japanese historians have well called it an age\r\nof anarchy.\r\n\r\nYOSHITERU\r\n\r\nIn 1545, the shogun, Yoshiharu, resigned in favour of his son,\r\nYoshiteru. Two years of quiet ensued in Kyoto, and then the old feud\r\nbroke out once more. The Hosokawa, represented by Harumoto, and the\r\nMiyoshi, by Chokei, fought for supremacy. Victory rested with the\r\nMiyoshi. The Hosokawa's power was shattered, and Chokei ruled in\r\nKyoto through his vassal, Matsunaga Hisahide. The era is memorable\r\nfor the assassination of a shogun. Yoshiteru had become reconciled\r\nwith Chokei and was suffered to live quietly at Muromachi. But after\r\nChokei's death (he was poisoned by Hisahide), Yoshiteru's cousin,\r\nYoshihide, a son of Yoshikore, sought to be nominated successor to\r\nthe shogunate through the aid of Masanaga and Hisahide. In 1565, this\r\nplot matured. Hisahide suddenly sent a force which attacked\r\nYoshiteru's palace and killed the shogun. Yoshihide replaced the\r\nmurdered potentate, and the Matsunaga family succeeded to the power\r\npreviously wielded by the Miyoshi. Yoshiteru's younger brother,\r\nYoshiaki, fled to Omi, but afterwards made his way to Owari, where\r\nOda Nobunaga took him by the hand and ultimately placed him in the\r\nshogun's seat at Kyoto.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nAmong the fifteen representatives of the Ashikaga, two were slain by\r\ntheir own vassals, five died in exile, and one had to commit suicide.\r\nFrom the accession of Takauji, in 1338, to the death of Yoshiaki, in\r\n1597, a period of 259 years, there was not so much as one decade of\r\nsignal success and efficient government. With justice the story of\r\nthe time has been summed up in the epithet \"ge-koku-jo,\" or the\r\noverthrow of the upper by the lower. The appreciation of the eminent\r\nhistorian, Rai Sanyo, is most faithful. Every great conflict\r\nthroughout the era was marked by similar features. It is a weary\r\nrecord of broken promises, violated allegiances, and family feuds. If\r\nthe Hatakeyama, the Hosokawa, and the Miyoshi set their own interests\r\nabove those of the shogun, the Ashikaga, in turn, sacrificed the\r\ninterests of the Throne on the altar of their own ambition. A river\r\ncannot be purer than its source. If the Miyoshi vassals plotted\r\nagainst their chiefs, so did the latter against the Hosokawa; so did\r\nthe Hosokawa against the Ashikaga; so did the Ashikaga against the\r\nImperial family, and so did one branch of the Imperial family against\r\nanother. Everywhere there was lack of loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty wanting among masters was equally deficient among\r\nservants. There is no more treacherous episode in the Middle Ages\r\nthan Matsunaga Hisahide's poisoning of his liege lord to compass the\r\ndownfall of the Miyoshi family and slaying the shogun, Yoshiteru, to\r\noverthrow the Ashikaga, though he enjoyed the confidence of both. The\r\nDai Nihon-rekishi (History of Great Japan) observes that the ethical\r\nprimers, with which a literary education had formerly familiarized\r\nthe nation, lost their influence in this military era. There was no\r\ninordinate desire for landed property until the Gen-Hei epoch, when a\r\nmanor became the principal reward of a successful soldier.\r\nThereafter, greed for domains acquired strength every year. Again,\r\nwhen Yoritomo became so-tsuihoshi (commander-in-chief) and so-jito\r\n(general steward) of the whole country, and his meritorious vassals\r\nwere appointed shugo and jito in each province, local authority\r\npassed from the Throne to the military families, and when, after the\r\nShokyu struggle, the shugo and the jito came into actual possession\r\nof the estates they had previously administered, military feudalism\r\nwas practically established. The Hojo, by their just administration\r\nand astute measures, brought this system into esteem, but under the\r\nAshikaga regime the reality of landed possession grew to be the\r\nunique aim of existence, and, to achieve it, sons forgot their\r\npaternal relation and vassals lost sight of fealty. The nation\r\nengaged in an armed scramble; individualism became paramount, and\r\nsocial obligations were ignored. This is the more noteworthy because\r\nloyalty is so typical a Japanese virtue.\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ASHIKAGA\r\n\r\nThe common saying that the Kamakura Bakufu brought the entire country\r\nunder one administrative control requires modification. It was not\r\nuntil Tokugawa days in the seventeenth century that the whole sixty\r\nprovinces passed under one feudal ruler. Still as between the\r\nKamakura Bakufu and the Muromachi, the latter, though its military\r\nsupremacy was less complete, may be said to have extended its\r\ninfluence theoretically over the whole of the lands throughout the\r\nempire except the Chokodo estates.\r\n\r\nIn another respect, also, the advantage lay with the Muromachi\r\nshogunate. During the Kamakura era, the Court magnates continued to\r\ndespise the Bakufu adherents, and the distance between the capital\r\nand Kamakura imparted to the latter an element of rusticity. But with\r\nthe establishment of the Muromachi shogunate a change took place. The\r\nBakufu, the visible repository of power, stood side by side with the\r\nCourt, and opportunities for close relations existed constantly.\r\nMoreover, the Court nobles, notably antagonistic to the military\r\nregime, followed the fortunes of the Southern dynasty, those alone\r\nremaining in the capital who were on more or less intimate terms with\r\nthe military. Such were the Nijo, the Saionji, the Hino, and so\r\nforth. These observed the behests of the Bakufu, sought to acquire\r\nthe latter's confidence, and always paid respect to the Hana no\r\nGosho, as the shogun was called. So close were the relations that for\r\nceremonial purposes at the Bakufu, it was customary to employ Court\r\nofficials, and witty writers of the time discourse amusingly on the\r\noften clumsy efforts made by the courtiers to ape the customs and\r\nacquire the dialects of the provincial soldiers.\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE CENTRAL BAKUFU\r\n\r\nThe administrative power having been transferred from the Court to\r\nthe Bakufu, it may be said that the sei-i tai-shogun exercised\r\nsupreme authority throughout the empire. But the shogun himself did\r\nnot actually discharge administrative duties. That was done by the\r\nkwanryo with the shogun's consent. Originally this official was\r\ncalled shitsuji (manager), and his functions were to look after the\r\naffairs of a provincial magnate's establishment. During the Kamakura\r\nera, the Ashikaga family occupied a high place. Of Minamoto origin,\r\nit was connected with the Hojo by marriage, and for generations its\r\nshitsuji had been a member of the Ko family. Ashikaga Takauji\r\nmade Ko no Moronao his shitsuji, and a highly competent captain\r\nhe proved himself. Subsequently, in 1362, Shiba Yoshimasa was\r\nappointed shitsuji, but soon his title was changed to kwanryo\r\n(governor-general), and it thenceforth became customary for the\r\nlatter position to be occupied by a member of one of the three\r\nfamilies, Shiba, Hosokawa, and Hatakeyama, in succession.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, the kwanryo corresponded to the skikken (regent) of\r\nKamakura days. But whereas, the Kamakura shikken exercised virtually\r\nautocratic authority, the shogun being a minor, the Muromachi\r\nkwanryo, nominally, at all events, was under the control of an adult\r\nshogun. In fact, the kwanryo in the Muromachi polity resembled the\r\nbetto of the Man-dokoro in Yoritomo's time. For the rest, the\r\nMuromachi Bakufu was organized on practically the same lines as its\r\nKamakura prototype. There was a Man-dokoro, a Monju-dokoro, and a\r\nSamurai-dokoro, and the staff of these offices was taken originally,\r\nas far as possible, from the families of men who had distinguished\r\nthemselves as legislators and administrators at Kamakura. There were\r\nalso officials called bugyo (commissioners) who directed the\r\nenforcement of laws and ordinances. These commissioners numbered\r\nthirty-six, and each had his own sphere of duties: as the shonin\r\nbugyo, who controlled judicial affairs; the tosen bugyo, who dealt\r\nwith affairs of foreign trade; the jisha bugyo, who superintended\r\ntemples and shrines; the onsho bugyo, who had to do with official\r\nrewards, etc.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\nAt Kamakura, also, there was a kwanryo to guard the eastern provinces\r\n(Kwanto). In Takauji's time, his second son, Motouji, was appointed\r\nto this office, and it was thenceforth inherited for some\r\ngenerations, the Uesugi family furnishing a shitsuji. Ultimately the\r\nKamakura kwanryo became a powerful military satrap, hostile to the\r\nMuromachi shogun. The holder of the office then received the title of\r\nkubo, and the hitherto shitsuji became kwanryo. In other respects the\r\nKamakura polity retained the form it had under Yoritomo: a Hyojo-shu\r\n(Council), a Hikitsuke-shu, a Monju-dokoro, a Samurai-dokoro, and\r\nvarious bugyo. In Kyushu and Dewa, the principal officer was called\r\nshugo, that post being of special importance; while in the other\r\nprovinces shugo and jito (high constables and land-stewards)\r\ncontinued to officiate as before.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of these high constables--great military magnates or\r\nrelatives of the shogun--extended to two or more provinces, and the\r\nshugo were then called kuni-mochi-shu (province-holder). A daimyo\r\n(great name, i.e. feudal lord), in communicating with Muromachi, had\r\nto make a kuni-mochi his medium. For the Kwanto and Shikoku, the\r\nHosokawa house was the kunimochi; for Shinano, Etchu, Echigo, and\r\nKaga, the Hatakeyama; for Ise, Kai, and Suruga, the Yamana; and for\r\nKyushu, the tandai. After the power of the tandai had declined, the\r\nOuchi family took its place. In the days of Yoshinori's shogunate,\r\nthere were twenty-two shugo in the country, and seven of them\r\nadministered three provinces or more, each. The provincial governors\r\nappointed by the Southern Court disappeared, for the most part,\r\nduring the War of the Dynasties, and on the restoration of peace the\r\nonly one of these high officials that remained was Kitabatake of Ise.\r\n\r\nSHUGO AND JITO\r\n\r\nOriginally appointed for administrative and fiscal purposes only, the\r\nshugo said jito acquired titles of land-ownership from the beginning\r\nof the Ashikaga era. To plunder and annex a neighbouring province\r\nbecame thenceforth a common feat on the part of these officials. In\r\n1390, tracts of land measuring from one-half of a province to two or\r\nthree provinces are found to have been converted from the shugo's\r\njurisdictional areas into military domains. Such magnates as Yamana\r\nTokiuji held from five to eleven provinces. These puissant captains\r\nhad castles and armies of their own. At first, they respected the\r\nrequisitions of the Bakufu. Thus, in 1463, when an elaborate Buddhist\r\nceremony had to be performed on the decease of Yoshimasa's mother, a\r\ntax in the form of cotton cloth was levied from the shugo, a ruler of\r\nthree provinces contributing ten thousand pieces; a ruler of two\r\nprovinces, five thousand, and so on.*\r\n\r\n*A \"piece\" was 40 feet, approximately. When the castle of Edo was\r\nbuilt in Tokugawa days--seventeenth century--each daimyo had to\r\ncontribute \"aid\" (otetsudai), after the Ashikaga custom.\r\n\r\nBut after the Onin War (1467-1469), military magnates resided wholly\r\non their own domains and paid no attention to requisitions from the\r\nBakufu. Further, these magnates compelled all jito and go-kenin\r\nwithin their jurisdiction to serve as their vassals. Previously to\r\nthe Onin era the shugo had resided, for the most part, in Kyoto,\r\ndelegating the discharge of their provincial functions to deputies\r\n(shugo-dai), chosen by the shugo and approved by the Bakufu.\r\nPresently, the process of selection was dispensed with, and the\r\noffice became hereditary. Thus, Yusa of the Hatakeyama, Oda of the\r\nShiba, Uragami of the Akamatsu, and so forth are examples of deputies\r\nwho resided permanently in the provinces concerned and acquired\r\ninfluence there superior even to that of their principals. The\r\ndeputies, in turn, had their vice-deputies (ko-shugo-dai), to whom\r\nthe name daikwan (another term for \"deputy\") was often given. These\r\ndaikwan were selected from among the members or vassals of a shugo's\r\nfamily to act provisionally as shugo-dai. As for the jito, from the\r\nmiddle of the Kamakura epoch their posts became mere sinecures, the\r\nemoluments going to support their families, or being paid over to a\r\ntemple or shrine. Occasionally the office was sold or pawned. The\r\ncomparatively small areas of land within which the jito officiated\r\nsoon came to be recognized as their private domains, but after the\r\nOnin commotion this system underwent a change, the jito becoming\r\nvassals of the shugo. Many, however, held their original position\r\nuntil the middle of the sixteenth century. In the days of Toyotomi\r\nHideyoshi and Oda Nobunaga--namely, the second half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury--the name jito was given to the headman of a village or\r\ndistrict, who served as the immediate representative of authority.\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nCultivated land (koden) was the great source of official revenue. The\r\narea under rice--the principal staple of production--in the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century was about a million of cho,* or two and a half\r\nmillion acres; and this was owned by the Court, the Court nobles, the\r\nmilitary magnates, the temples, and the shrines. From an uncertain\r\ndate, but probably the close of the Kamakura Bakufu, the area of a\r\ndomain ceased to be calculated in terms of cho and tan and was\r\nexpressed in kwan (one thousand cash, or mori). The use of the\r\nkwanior this purpose had reference to the military service leviable\r\nupon the land. Thus, when land of one hundred kwan-mon was mentioned,\r\nan area capable of supporting military service valued at one hundred\r\nkwan-mon was understood. The calculation was very simple: one tsubo\r\ncorresponded to one mon, so that one kwan-mon represented one\r\nthousand tsubo for the purposes of this assessment.**\r\n\r\n*The cho was equal to 10 tan, and the tan comprised 360 tsubo, the\r\ntsubo being a square of 6 feet side. At present the area under\r\ncultivation is some 3 millions of cho (7.5 millions of acres).\r\n\r\n**In the Ashikaga era the unit of currency may be said to have been\r\nthe copper cash of China--called Eiraku-sen after the name (Chinese,\r\nYunglo) of the Chinese year period when it was issued. Gold and\r\nsilver coins were also in use; namely, the gold ryo, which was\r\nequivalent to 10 silver ryo; but their circulation was comparatively\r\nsmall. The gold ryo was equal to 2000 mon of copper coins, and as 100\r\nmon purchased 1 to (one-tenth part of a koku) of rice, it follows\r\nthat the gold ryo represented 2 koku, or 30 yen of modern currency,\r\nthe silver ryo representing 3 yen (1 yen=2 shillings-50 cents). It\r\nfollows also that 10 strings of cash (one kwan) were worth a koku of\r\nrice, or 15 yen. As for silk piece-goods, 1 roll (hiki = 48 yards) of\r\nthe best kind was worth 45 yen, and the second and third-class kinds\r\nranged from 33 to 22.5 yen. Finally, in the year 1498, the records\r\nshow that the daily wage of a labourer was some 16 sen of modern\r\nmoney (about 4 pence or 8 cents).\r\n\r\nFrom various documents it appears that the three grades of\r\nland--best, medium, and inferior--were taxed at the rate of sixty,\r\nforty, and thirty per cent., respectively, of the yield. In other\r\nwords, the average land-tax was forty per cent, of the yield--called\r\nshi-ko roku-min--or four parts to the Government and six to the\r\nfarmer. If we consider the rates between the current price of land\r\nand the tax, there is a record, dated 1418, which shows that the tax\r\nlevied by a temple--Myoko-ji--was twenty per cent, of the market\r\nprice of the land. But it would seem that the ratio in the case of\r\nGovernment taxation was much smaller, being only one and a half per\r\ncent, of the market value. There were, however, other imposts, which,\r\nthough not accurately stated, must have brought the land-tax to much\r\nmore than forty per cent, of the yield.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Imperial Court, we find it supported by domains\r\nhereditarily held; by contributions from the seizei (expediency\r\ntaxes, that is to say, taxes set aside for extraordinary State\r\nrequirements); by occasional presents, and by revenues from kugoden\r\n(private Imperial land). The Court nobles had their own domains,\r\nusually small. All these estates, those of the Crown, of princes, and\r\nof Court nobles, were subject to a system called hansai. That is to\r\nsay, one-half of their revenues were leviable for military purposes.\r\nOriginally this impost was understood to be a loan to the Bakufu, but\r\nultimately it came to be regarded as a normal levy, though its\r\npractical effect was to reduce the revenue from such domains by\r\none-half. Moreover, as the arrogance of the military magnates in the\r\nprovinces grew more insistent, and as the Bakufu's ability to oppose\r\nthem became less effective, the domain of the Court nobles suffered\r\nfrequent encroachments.\r\n\r\nREVENUES OF THE BAKUFU\r\n\r\nOne source of revenue for the Bakufu was its domains in various\r\nplaces; another was the buke-yaku, or military-house dues. These were\r\nat first two per cent, of the land-tax of the house concerned, but\r\nafterwards they increased to five per cent. Thus an estate paying one\r\nhundred koku in the form of land-tax, had to pay a further five koku\r\nas buke-yaku, the latter proceeds being sent to Kyoto for the use of\r\nthe shogun's household. Another important levy was the tansen, which,\r\nas its name implies, was a land-rate levied at so much per tan\r\n(one-quarter of an acre), the proceeds being devoted to special\r\npurposes, as, for example, to defray the cost of grand ceremonials or\r\nof new edifices. The records show one payment of tansen which works\r\nout at fifty mon per tan. Another document indicates that the monthly\r\nexpenses of the Man-dokoro were some sixty kwanmon and that they were\r\ndefrayed by levying taxes upon pawnbrokers and sake-dealers in Kyoto\r\nand in Omi province. The latter tax (shuko-zei) is shown to have\r\nbeen, on one occasion, two kwan eight hundred mon per house. The\r\nBakufu collected dues on foreign commerce, also, and miscellaneous\r\nimposts of an irregular character made no small addition to its\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nREVENUE OF SHRINES AND TEMPLES\r\n\r\nTemples and shrines derived part of their income from port-dues and\r\nbarrier-tolls. Thus, the Hachiman temple of Iwashimizu received tolls\r\nfrom all traffic passing the Yamazaki barrier; Kofuku-ji levied\r\nduties on vessels entering Hyogo port, and Engaku-ji of Kamakura\r\ncollected tolls at the Hakone barrier (sekisho). Such taxes proving\r\nvery prolific and easy to levy, the number of barriers increased\r\nrapidly, to the no small obstruction of trade and travel. Further,\r\nthe priests were constantly enriched with donations of land and\r\nmoney, in addition to the rents and taxes obtained from their own\r\ndomains, and thus it resulted that several of the great monasteries\r\npossessed much wealth. To that fact is to be attributed the numerous\r\nestablishments of soldier-priests maintained at Enryaku-ji, on\r\nHiei-zan, and at Kofuku-ji, in Nara. To that also is to be ascribed\r\nin part the signal development of literature among the friars, and\r\nthe influence wielded by the Shinto officials of Kitano and the betto\r\nof Hachiman.\r\n\r\nREVENUE OF JITO\r\n\r\nA special tax levied by the jito was the hyakusho-yaku, or farmers'\r\ndues. These were one per cent, of the land-tax originally, but the\r\nrate was subsequently doubled. Other heavy imposts were frequently\r\nand arbitrarily enacted, and there can be no doubt that financial\r\ndisorder contributed materially to bringing about the terrible\r\ncalamities of the Battle era (Sengoku Jidai), as the period of eleven\r\ndecades ending in 1600 is called. For, if the fiscal system was thus\r\ndefective during the comparatively prosperous age of the Ashikaga, it\r\nfell into measureless confusion at a later date. It has been stated\r\nabove that the area under rice cultivation at the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century was about one million did; at the close of that\r\ncentury the figure was found to have decreased by more than fifty\r\nthousands of cho. From such a result, opposed as it is to all records\r\nof normal development, the unhappy plight of the agricultural classes\r\nmay be inferred.\r\n\r\nTOKENS OF CURRENCY\r\n\r\nMinting operations also were discontinued under the Ashikaga. Cotton\r\ncloth and rice served as principal media of exchange. Fortunately,\r\ncommerce with China in the days of the Ming rulers, and Yoshimasa's\r\nundignified though practical requests, brought a large supply of\r\nYunglo (Japanese, Eiraku) copper cash, which, with other Chinese\r\ncoins of the Tang and Sung dynasties, served the Japanese as media.\r\nThis fortuitous element was conspicuous in all the domain of finance,\r\nespecially after the Onin War, when the territorial magnates fixed\r\nthe taxes at their own convenience and without any thought of\r\nuniformity. One of the only sincere and statesmanlike efforts of\r\nreform was made, in 1491, by Hojo Soun. He reduced the rate then\r\nruling, namely, equal parts to the tax-collector and to the taxpayer,\r\nand made it forty per cent, to the former and sixty to the latter,\r\nand he ordained that any jito collecting so much as a mon in excess\r\nof the official figure, should be severely punished. How the people\r\nfared elsewhere it is not possible to say accurately, but the records\r\nshow that extraordinary imposts were levied frequently, and that the\r\ntansen was exacted again and again, as also were taxes on trades. As\r\nfor the Imperial household, such was its condition that it barely\r\nsubsisted on presents made by certain military magnates, so complete\r\nwas the decentralization of the empire in this period.\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE ASHIKAGA TOWARDS THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Ashikaga towards the Daikagu-ji line (the Southern\r\nCourt) of the Imperial house was evidently one of complete\r\nelimination at the outset. But the impossibility of achieving such a\r\nprogramme soon came to be recognized and reconciliation was\r\nsubstituted. Thenceforth, in appearance at all events, the\r\nrepresentatives of the Daikagu-ji line received due consideration and\r\nwere sufficiently provided with incomes, as witness the treatment of\r\nthe ex-Emperor Go-Kameyama by Yoshimitsu. But subsequent and repeated\r\nneglect of the claims of the Southern branch in regard to the vital\r\nmatter of the succession betrayed the insincerity of the Ashikaga,\r\nand provoked frequent appeals to arms.\r\n\r\nThe situation may be said to have been saved by the habit inaugurated\r\nat the close of the Heian epoch. From that time princes and nobles\r\nwho saw no prospect of secular distinction began to take the tonsure,\r\nand this retirement to the cloister was assiduously encouraged by the\r\nMuromachi shoguns. A similar policy commended itself in the case of\r\nprinces of the Jimyo-in branch (the Northern Court). It is true that,\r\nfrom the first, the representatives of this line had relied on the\r\nBakufu, whether of Kamakura or of Muromachi. But in their hearts they\r\ndeeply resented the usurpation of the shogunate, and the latter,\r\nfully cognisant of that sentiment, guarded against its effective\r\ndisplay by providing only meagre allowances for the support of the\r\nImperial household (Kinri) and the ex-Emperor's household (Sendo),\r\nand by contriving that only young and delicate princes should succeed\r\nto the throne. Thus, of seven sovereigns who reigned between 1336 and\r\n1464, the oldest was only sixteen at the time of his succession and\r\nthe youngest was six. When an Emperor reached maturity, it was usual\r\nthat he should abdicate and administer thenceforth from the Inchu.\r\nThus the influence of the Court was divided between the Kinri and the\r\nSendo--the reigning sovereign and the retired. But the real\r\ndepository of power was the shikken (regent) of the Inchu, to which\r\noffice a member of the Hino family, maternal relatives of the Bakufu,\r\nwas habitually appointed. When Yoshinori was shogun, he himself acted\r\nas shikken of the Inchu. As for the Court officials properly so\r\ncalled, from the kwampaku downwards, they were mere figureheads.\r\nHolding their posts, indeed, as of old, they constituted, not\r\nadministrative actors, but an audience.\r\n\r\nYOSHIMITSU AND THE THRONE\r\n\r\nThe shogun Yoshimitsu instituted the custom of inviting the sovereign\r\nto his mansion, and thenceforth such visits became a recognized\r\nfeature of the relations between the Imperial and the Muromachi\r\nCourts. Yoshimitsu himself frequently repaired to the Kinri and the\r\nSendo, and frequently accompanied the Empresses and their ladies on\r\nsocial visits or pleasure excursions. He is said to have gone in and\r\nout at the Imperial palaces without the slightest reserve, and on\r\nmore than one occasion history accuses him of flagrantly\r\ntransgressing the limits of decency in his intercourse with\r\nSuken-mon-in, mother of the Emperor Go-Enyu. As a subverter of public\r\nmorals, however, the palm belongs, not to Yoshimitsu, but to his\r\nimmediate successor, Yoshimochi. He is said to have visited the Kinri\r\nand the Sendo six or seven times every month, and to have there\r\nindulged in all kinds of licence. History says, indeed, that he was\r\noften unable to appear at Court owing to illness resulting from\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\nPRINCES AND PRIESTS\r\n\r\nAs to the fact that, from the close of the Heian epoch, the cloister\r\noften proved a prison for Imperial princes whose ambition might have\r\nbeen troublesome had they remained at large, the following figures\r\nare eloquent:\r\n\r\n                                                        Number\r\n                                                       entering\r\n                                                       religion\r\n\r\n   Of 8 sons born to Emperor Fushimi    (1287-1298)         7\r\n\r\n      9  \"     \"   \" Emperor Go-Fushimi (1298-1301)         9\r\n\r\n      4  \"     \"   \" Emperor Hanazono   (1307-1318)         4\r\n\r\n      2  \"     \"   \" Emperor Suko       (1348-1352)         2\r\n\r\n      9  \"     \"   \" Prince Sadatsune,                      8\r\n              grandson of the Emperor Suko\r\n\r\n     14 \"     \"   \"  Emperor Go-Kogon   (1352-1371)        14\r\n\r\nAbsolute accuracy is not claimed for these figures, but they are\r\ncertainly close approximations. In fact, under the Muromachi Bakufu,\r\nevery son of a sovereign, except the Prince Imperial, was expected to\r\nbecome a monk. The Ashikaga adopted a similar system and applied it\r\nruthlessly in their own families. In truth, the Ashikaga epoch was\r\nnotorious for neglect of the obligations of consanguinity. Father is\r\nfound pitted against son, uncle against nephew, and brother against\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TILES OF THE DAIBUTSUDEN OF TODAI-JI\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DECORATION OF TOKONOMA (AN ALCOVE IN A JAPANESE\r\nPARLOUR)--Muromachi Period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INTERCOURSE, LITERATURE, ART, RELIGION, MANNERS, AND CUSTOMS\r\nIN THE MUROMACHI EPOCH\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nAFTER the Mongol invasion of Kyushu, Japan held no intercourse with\r\nthe outer world for several decades, nor does her friendship seem to\r\nhave been sought by any oversea nation. In the closing year of the\r\nthirteenth century, merchantmen flying the Yuan flag are reported to\r\nhave arrived, but the record is nebulous, and the same may be said of\r\na passing reference that, in 1341, Japanese vessels were sent to\r\nChina to procure articles manufactured there. We reach more solid\r\nground a year later (1342), when the Ashikaga chief, Takauji, being\r\nengaged in building the temple Tenryu-ji, opened trade with China for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining apparatus, vestments, and works of art. The\r\nnumber of vessels was limited to two annually, and the trade must not\r\nexceed five hundred kwan-mon (£750, or $3700). Some of the objects\r\nthen carried to Japan survive to this day in the form of celadon\r\nvases known in Japan as Tenryuji-seiji.* Meanwhile, not a few\r\nBuddhist priests crossed the sea from China to preach their faith,\r\nand it is certain that during the War of the Dynasties in Japan, when\r\nthe south of the country was in a state of anarchy, privateering in\r\nKorean waters was freely resorted to by Japanese adventurers. A\r\nKorean envoy arrived at Fukuhara, in Settsu, in 1367, bearer of a\r\nstrong protest against this marauding, and declaring that for a\r\ndecade past assassination and plunder had been freely practised by\r\nJapanese subjects on the inhabitants of the Korean littoral. China\r\nand Korea were then in a troubled condition.\r\n\r\n*The merchantmen received the name of Tenryuji-bune (bune signifies\r\n\"ship\")\r\n\r\nIn the year (1368) after the arrival of this envoy, the Yuan dynasty\r\nwent down in China before the Ming, and in Korea the kingdom of Koma\r\nwas overthrown, the Yi dynasty rising on its ruins and calling the\r\npeninsula Chosen. The Ming sovereign immediately attempted to\r\nestablish tradal intercourse with Japan, but the negotiations failed,\r\nand not until 1392 is there any record of oversea relations. Then, at\r\nlength, Korea's protest elicited a reply from Japan. The shogun,\r\nYoshimitsu, sent to Chosen a despatch, signifying that piracy had\r\nbeen interdicted, that all captives would be returned, and that he\r\ndesired to establish friendly relations. It appears that at that time\r\nChina also suffered from the depredations of Japanese corsairs, for\r\nthe annals say that she repeatedly remonstrated, and that, in 1401,\r\nYoshimitsu despatched to China an envoy carrying presents and\r\nescorting some Chinese subjects who had been cast away on the\r\nJapanese coast or carried captive thither. Another record suggests\r\nthat the Chinese Emperor was perplexed between the two warring Courts\r\nin Japan. At the time of his accession, a body of Mongol fugitives\r\nestablished themselves in Shantung, where they received assistance\r\nfrom some Japanese adventurers. The Ming sovereign opened\r\ncommunications on the subject with Prince Kanenaga, who held Kyushu\r\nin the interests of the Southern Court, but the tone of the Chinese\r\nmonarch was so arrogant that Prince Kanenaga made no reply. Then\r\nTaitsu employed a Buddhist priest, but the character of this bonze\r\nhaving been detected, he was thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nThese things happened in 1380. In the following year Taitsu\r\ndespatched a duly credited envoy who used menacing language and was\r\nsent back with a defiance from Prince Kanenaga. The priest, however,\r\nwas set free in 1382, and having learned while in Japan that two\r\nCourts were disputing the title to the Crown, he informed the Chinese\r\nsovereign in that sense, and the latter subsequently addressed\r\nhimself to Kyoto, with the result noted above, namely, that\r\nYoshimitsu opened friendly relations (1401). It was to the Ouchi\r\nfamily of Suwo that the management of intercourse with Chosen was\r\nentrusted, the latter sending its envoys to Yamaguchi. Subsequently,\r\nafter Ouchi Yoshihiro's disaffection and disaster, a Buddhist priest\r\nand well-known artist, Soami, acted as Muromachi's envoy to the Ming\r\nCourt, being accompanied by a merchant, Koetomi, who is described as\r\nthoroughly conversant with Chinese conditions. By these two the first\r\ncommercial treaty was negotiated. It provided that an envoy should be\r\nsent by each of the contracting parties in every period of ten years,\r\nthe suite of this envoy to be limited to two hundred, and any ship\r\ncarrying arms to be regarded as a pirate.\r\n\r\nThe first envoy from the Ming Court under this treaty was met by\r\nYoshimitsu himself at Hyogo, and being escorted to Kyoto, was\r\nhospitably lodged in a hotel there. Instructions were also issued\r\nfrom Muromachi to the officials in Kyushu, peremptorily interdicting\r\npiracy and ordering the arrest of any that contravened the veto.\r\nFurther, the high constables in several provinces were enjoined to\r\nencourage trade with China by sending the best products of their\r\nlocalities. In fact, Yoshimitsu showed himself thoroughly earnest in\r\npromoting oversea commerce, and a considerable measure of success\r\nattended his efforts. Unfortunately, an interruption was caused in\r\n1419, when some seventeen thousand Koreans, Mongolians, and \"southern\r\nbarbarians\"--a name given promiscuously to aliens--in 227 ships, bore\r\ndown on Tsushima one midsummer day and were not driven off until the\r\ngreat families of Kyushu--the Otomo, the Shoni, the Kikuchi, and the\r\nShiba--had joined forces to attack the invaders. The origin of this\r\nincident is wrapped in mystery, but probably the prohibition of\r\nJapanese pirates was not enforced for the protection of Chosen, and\r\nthe assault on Tsushima was a desperate attempt at retaliation.\r\n\r\nYoshimochi, however, who was then shogun, seems to have associated\r\nChina with the invasion, for a Ming envoy, arriving just at the time\r\nof the contest, was indignantly refused audience. Thereafter, the\r\ntandai appointed from Muroinachi to administer the affairs of Kyushu\r\nwas driven out by the Shoni family, and the shogun's policy of\r\nchecking piracy ceased to be enforced, so that the coasts of China\r\nand Chosen were much harried, all legitimate commerce being\r\nsuspended. When Yoshinori became shogun, however, this was one of the\r\ndirections in which he turned his reforming hand. A Buddhist priest,\r\nDoen, proceeded to the Ming Court as Muromachi's delegate, and the\r\nChinese sovereign agreed to restore the old relations, transmitting\r\nfor that purpose a hundred tallies to be carried by the merchantmen.\r\nThese tallies were distributed to several high constables, to five\r\ngreat temples, and to merchants in Hyogo and Sakai, the corresponding\r\ntallies* being entrusted to the Ouchi family, which, having now\r\nrecovered its power, was charged with the duty of superintending the\r\ntrade with China. Meanwhile, So Sadamori of Tsushima had established\r\ncommercial relations with Chosen, and received from thence a yearly\r\nconsignment of two hundred koku of soy beans, the vessel that carried\r\nthe staple being guarded by boats known as Tsushima-bune.\r\n\r\n*The tallies were cards on which a line of ideographs were inscribed.\r\nThe card was then cut along the line, and a moiety was given to the\r\ntrader, the corresponding moiety being kept by the superintendent.\r\n\r\nThus, it fell out that the right of supervising the trade with China\r\nand Korea came into the exclusive possession of the Ouchi and the So,\r\nrespectively, and being liberally encouraged, brought great wealth to\r\nthem as well as to other territorial magnates of the central and\r\nsouthern provinces. The records show that large profits were\r\nrealized. Four or five hundred per cent, is spoken of, and, further,\r\nthe Ming sovereign, in Yoshimasa's time, responded generously, as has\r\nbeen already shown, to the shogun's appeal for supplies of copper\r\ncash. One Japanese fan could be exchanged for a copy of a valuable\r\nbook, and a sword costing one kwan-mon in Japan fetched five kwan-mon\r\nin China. Such prices were paid, however, for rare goods only,\r\nnotably for Japanese raw silk, fifty catties (sixty-seven lbs.) of\r\nwhich sold for ten kwan-mon (£15, or $75, approximately). Gold, too,\r\nwas much more valuable in China than in Japan. Ten ryo of the yellow\r\nmetal could be obtained in Japan for from twenty to thirty kwan-mon\r\nand sold in China for 130. Sealskins, swords, spears, pepper,\r\nsulphur, fans, lacquer, raw silk, etc. were the chief staples of\r\nexports; and velvet, musk, silk fabrics, porcelains, etc.,\r\nconstituted the bulk of the imports. The metropolis being Kyoto, with\r\nits population of some 900,000, Hyogo was the most important harbour\r\nfor the trade, and after it came Hakata,* in Chikuzen; Bonotsu, in\r\nSatsuma; Obi, in Hyuga, and Anotsu, in Ise. The customs duties at\r\nHyogo alone are said to have amounted to the equivalent of £15,000,\r\nor $75,000, annually.\r\n\r\n*Hakata's place was subsequently taken by Hirado.\r\n\r\nIn China, Ningpo was the chief port. It had a mercantile-marine\r\noffice and an inn for foreign guests. The tribute levied on the trade\r\nwas sent thence to Nanking. In size the vessels employed were from 50\r\nto 130 tons, greater dimensions being eschewed through fear of loss.\r\nAn invoice shows that the goods carried by a ship in 1458 were:\r\nsulphur (410,750 lbs.); copper (206,000 lbs.); spears (11); fans\r\n(1250); swords (9500); lacquered wares (634 packages), and sapan-wood\r\n(141,333 lbs.). During the days of Yoshimasa's shogunate such profits\r\nwere realized that overtrading took place, and there resulted a\r\ntemporary cessation. Fifty years later, when Yoshiharu ruled at\r\nMuromachi (1529), a Buddhist priest, Zuisa, sent by the shogun to\r\nChina, and an envoy, Sosetsu, despatched by the Ouchi family, came\r\ninto collision at Ningpo. It was a mere question of precedence, but\r\nin the sequel Zuisa was seized, Ningpo was sacked, and its governor\r\nwas murdered. The arm of the shogun at that time could not reach the\r\nOuchi family, and a demand for the surrender of Sosetsu was in vain\r\npreferred at Muromachi through the medium of the King of Ryukyu.\r\nYoshiharu could only keep silence.\r\n\r\nThe Ming sovereign subsequently (1531) attempted to exact redress by\r\nsending a squadron to Tsushima, but the deputy high constable of the\r\nOuchi compelled these ships to fly, defeated, and thereafter all\r\nfriendly intercourse between Japan and China was interrupted,\r\npiratical raids by the Japanese taking its place. This estrangement\r\ncontinued for seventeen years, until (1548) Ouchi Yoshitaka\r\nre-established friendly relations with Chosen and, at the same time,\r\nmade overtures to China, which, being seconded by the despatch of an\r\nenvoy--a Buddhist priest--Shuryo from Muromachi, evoked a favourable\r\nresponse. Once more tallies were issued, but the number of vessels\r\nbeing limited to three and their crews to three hundred, the\r\nresulting commerce was comparatively small. Just at this epoch, too,\r\nOccidental merchantmen arrived in China, and the complexion of the\r\nlatter's oversea trade underwent alteration. Thereafter, the Ashikaga\r\nfell, and their successor, Oda Nobunaga, made no attempt to re-open\r\ncommerce with China, while his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, planned\r\nthe invasion of the Middle Kingdom, so that the sword was more in\r\nevidence than the soroban.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE PIRACY\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace the beginnings of Japanese piracy in Far\r\nEastern waters, but certainly it dated from a remote past and reached\r\nits extreme in the middle of the sixteenth century. The records show\r\nthat Murakami Yoshihiro, of Iyo province, obtained control of all the\r\ncorsairs in neighbouring seas and developed great puissance. Nor did\r\nany measure of opprobrium attach to his acts, for on his death he was\r\nsucceeded by Morokiyo, a scion of the illustrious Kitabatake family.\r\nNumbers flocked to his standard during the disordered era of the War\r\nof the Dynasties, and from Korea in the north to Formosa and Amoy in\r\nthe south the whole littoral was raided by them.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of protection the Ming rulers divided the coast into\r\nfive sections, Pehchihli, Shantung, Chekiang, Fuhkien, and\r\nLiangkwang, appointing a governor to each, building fortresses and\r\nenrolling soldiers. All this proving inefficacious, the Emperor\r\nTaitsu, as already stated, addressed to Ashikaga Yoshimitsu a\r\nremonstrance which moved the shogun to issue a strict injunction\r\nagainst the marauders. It was a mere formality. Chinese annals show\r\nthat under its provisions some twenty pirates were handed over by the\r\nJapanese and were executed by boiling in kettles. No such\r\ninternational refinement as extra-territorial jurisdiction existed in\r\nthose days, and the Japanese shogun felt no shame in delivering his\r\ncountrymen to be punished by an alien State. It is not wonderful that\r\nwhen Yoshimitsu died, the Chinese Emperor bestowed on him the\r\nposthumous title Kung-hsien-wang, or \"the faithful and obedient\r\nking.\" But boiling a score of the Wokou* in copper kettles did not at\r\nall intimidate the corsairs. On nearly all the main islands of the\r\nInland Sea and in the Kyushu waters they had their quarters. In fact,\r\nthe governors of islands and a majority of the military magnates\r\nhaving littoral estates, took part in the profitable pursuit. No less\r\nthan fourteen illustrious families were so engaged, and four of them\r\nopenly bore the title of kaizoku tai-shogun (commander-in-chief of\r\npirates). Moreover, they all obeyed the orders of the Ouchi family.\r\nIt is on record that Ouchi Masahiro led them in an incursion into\r\nChollado, the southern province of Korea, and exacted from the\r\nsovereign of Chosen a promise of yearly tribute to the Ouchi. This\r\nwas only one of several profitable raids. The goods appropriated in\r\nKorea were sometimes carried to China for sale, the pirates assuming,\r\nnow the character of peaceful traders, now that of ruthless\r\nplunderers. The apparition of these Pahan** ships seems to have\r\ninspired the Chinese with consternation. They do not appear to have\r\nmade any effective resistance. The decade between 1553 and 1563 was\r\nevidently their time of greatest suffering; and their annals of that\r\nera repay perusal, not only for their direct interest but also for\r\ntheir collateral bearing on the story of the invasion of Korea at the\r\nclose of the century.\r\n\r\n\"On the 23d of the fifth month of 1553, twenty-seven Japanese vessels\r\narrived at Lungwangtang. They looked like so many hills and their\r\nwhite sails were as clouds in the sky. On the fifth day of the fourth\r\nmonth of 1554, there appeared on the horizon a large ship which\r\npresently reached Lungwang-tang. Her crew numbered 562. They blew\r\nconches after the manner of trumpets, marshalled themselves in battle\r\narray, and surrounding the castle with flying banners, attacked it.\r\nOn the fourth day of the ninth month of 1555, a two-masted ship\r\ncarrying a crew of some hundreds came to Kinshan-hai, and on the next\r\nday she was followed by eight five-masted vessels with crews\r\ntotalling some thousands. They all went on shore and looted in\r\nsuccession. On the 23d of the second month of 1556, pirate ships\r\narrived at the entrance to Kinshan-hai. Their masts were like a dense\r\nforest of bamboo.\"\r\n\r\n*Yamato enemies.\r\n\r\n**Chinese pronunciation of the ideographs read by the Japanese\r\n\"Hachiman\" (god of War). The pirates inscribed on their sails the\r\nlegend Hachiman Dai-bosatsu.\r\n\r\nFurther records show that in 1556 the pirates entered Yang-chou,\r\nlooted and burned the city; that in 1559 they attacked Chekiang; that\r\nin 1560, they made their way to Taitsang, and thence pushed on\r\ntowards Shanghai, Sungteh, etc., looting towns almost daily. There\r\nwas no effective resistance. We find also the following appreciation\r\nof Japanese ships:\r\n\r\n\"The largest of the Japanese vessels can carry about three hundred\r\nmen; the medium-sized, from one to two hundred, and the smallest from\r\nfifty to eighty. They are constructed low and narrow. Thus, when they\r\nmeet a big ship they have to look up to attack her. The sails are not\r\nrigged like those of our ships which can be navigated in any wind.\r\nBut wicked people on the coast of Fuhkien sold their ships to the\r\nforeigners; and the buyers, having fitted them with double bottoms\r\nand keels shaped so as to cleave the waves, came to our shores in\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently the Chinese were better skilled in the art of shipbuilding\r\nthan the Japanese. As for the defensive measures of the Chinese the\r\nfollowing is recorded:\r\n\r\n\"The Government troops on sea and on land made every effort to keep\r\noff the pirates. They flew banners at morn and eve and fired guns\r\nseaward, so that the enemy, understanding by the flash and the\r\ndetonation that we were prepared to resist, abstained from landing.\r\nBut when the pirates handled their swords skilfully, their attack was\r\nfearful. Our countrymen when they saw these swordsmen, trembled and\r\nfled. Their fear of the Japanese was fear of the swords. The pirates'\r\nfirearms were only guns such as men use in pursuit of game. They did\r\nnot range over one hundred paces. But their skill in using their guns\r\nwas such that they never missed. We could not defeat them. They rise\r\nearly in the morning and take their breakfast kneeling down.\r\nAfterwards their chief ascends an eminence and they gather below to\r\nhear his orders. He tells them off in detachments not exceeding\r\nthirty men, and attaching them to officers, sends them to loot\r\nplaces. The detachments operate at distances of from five hundred to\r\na thousand yards, but unite at the sound of a conch.\r\n\r\n\"To re-enforce a detachment in case of emergency, small sections of\r\nthree or four swordsmen move about. At the sight of them our men\r\nflee. Towards dark the detachments return to headquarters and hand in\r\ntheir loot, never making any concealment. It is then distributed.\r\nThey always abduct women, and at night they indulge in drinking and\r\ndebauchery. They always advance in single rank at a slow pace, and\r\nthus their extension is miles long. For tens of days they can run\r\nwithout showing fatigue. In camping, they divide into many companies,\r\nand thus they can make a siege effective. Against our positions they\r\nbegin by sending a few men who by swift and deceptive movements cause\r\nour troops to exhaust all their projectiles fruitlessly, and then the\r\nassault is delivered. They are clever in using ambushes, and often\r\nwhen they seem to be worsted, their hidden forces spring up in our\r\nrear and throw our army into a panic.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt the truth of these records, naive as are\r\nsome of the descriptions. Unquestionably the Wokou were a terrible\r\nscourge to the Chinese on the eastern littoral.\r\n\r\nINTERCOURSE WITH RYUKYU\r\n\r\nJapanese annals say that the royal family of Ryukyu was descended\r\nfrom the hero Minamoto Tametomo who was banished to the island in\r\n1156, and certainly the inhabitants of the archipelago are a race\r\nclosely allied to the Japanese. But in 1373, the then ruler, Chuzan,\r\nsent an envoy to the Ming Court and became a tributary of the latter.\r\nIn 1416, however, an ambassador from the islands presented himself at\r\nthe Muromachi shogunate, and twenty-five years later (1441), the\r\nshogun Yoshinori, just before his death, bestowed Ryukyu on Shimazu\r\nTadakuni, lord of Satsuma, in recognition of meritorious services.\r\nSubsequently (1471) the shogun Yoshimasa, in compliance with a\r\nrequest from the Shimazu family, forbade the sailing of any vessel to\r\nRyukyu without a Shimazu permit, and when, a few years later, Miyake\r\nKunihide attempted to invade Ryukyu, the Shimazu received Muromachi's\r\n(Yoshitane's) commission to punish him. Historically, therefore,\r\nRyukyu formed part of Japan, but its rulers maintained a tributary\r\nattitude towards China until recent times, as will presently be seen.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE DURING THE MUROMACHI PERIOD\r\n\r\nThroughout the Muromachi period of two and a half centuries a group\r\nof military men held the administration and reaped all rewards and\r\nemoluments of office so that literary pursuits ranked in\r\ncomparatively small esteem. Some education was necessary, indeed, for\r\nmen of position, but eminent scholars were exceptional. Noteworthy\r\namong the latter were Nijo Yoshimoto, Ichijo Fuyuyoshi, Doin Kinsada,\r\nSanjonishi Sanetaka, and Kiyowara Naritada. Most renowned was Ichijo\r\nKaneyoshi. Equally versed in the classics of China and Japan, as well\r\nas in Buddhism and Confucianism, he composed several works of high\r\nmerit. A feature of the period was the erudition of the priests.\r\nGen-e, a bonze of the temple Hiei-zan, adopted the commentaries of\r\nthe Sung savants, Chengtzu and Chutsu, rejecting those of the earlier\r\nHan and Tang writers. In other words, he adopted the eclectic system\r\nof Buddhism and Confucianism as compounded by the scholars of the\r\nSung and the Yuan epochs, in preference to the system of earlier\r\npundits. The Emperor Go-Daigo invited Gen-e to Court and directed him\r\nto expound the Sutras. Thereafter, the Sung philosophy obtained wide\r\nallegiance, being preached by the priests of the Five Great Temples\r\nin Kyoto, and by all their provincial branches. On the other hand,\r\nthe hereditary schools of Oye and Sugawara, adhering to their old\r\ndogmas, fell behind the times and declined in influence.\r\n\r\nThe feature of the age in point of learning was that scholarship\r\nbecame a priestly specialty. From the Five Temples (Go-zari) students\r\nconstantly flocked to China, where they received instructions in the\r\nexoterics and esoterics of Buddhism, as modified by the creed of\r\nConfucius, laying the foundations of systems upon which philosophers\r\nof later ages, as Kazan and Seiga, built fair edifices. These priests\r\nof the Five Temples were more than religious propagandists: they were\r\nministers of State, as Tenkai and Soden were in after times under the\r\nTokugawa, and they practically commanded the shoguns. One reason\r\noperating to produce this result was that, in an age when lineage or\r\nmilitary prowess was the sole secular step to fortune, men of civil\r\ntalent but humble birth had to choose between remaining in hopeless\r\ninsignificance or entering the priesthood where knowledge and virtue\r\nwere sure passports to distinction. It was thus that in nearly every\r\nmonastery there were found men of superior intellect and erudition.\r\nThe fact was recognized. When Ashikaga Takauji desired to take\r\ncounsel of Muso Kokushi, he repaired to that renowned priest's temple\r\nand treated him as a respected parent; and Yoshimitsu, the third of\r\nthe Ashikaga shoguns, showed equal respect towards Gido, Zekkai and\r\nJorin, whose advice he constantly sought.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, indeed, that in an age when the sword was the\r\nparamount tribunal, the highest dignitaries in the land revered the\r\nexponents of ethics and literature. Takauji and his younger brother,\r\nTadayoshi, sat at the feet of Gen-e as their preceptor. Yoshimitsu\r\nappointed Sugawara Hidenaga to be Court lecturer. Ujimitsu, the\r\nKamakura kwanryo, took Sugawara Toyonaga for preacher. Yoshimasa's\r\nlove of poetry impelled him to publish the Kinshudan.* Above all,\r\nYoshihisa was an earnest scholar. He had a thorough knowledge of\r\nChinese and Japanese classics; he was himself a poetaster of no mean\r\nability; he read canonical books even as he sat in his palanquin;\r\nunder his patronage Ichijo Kaneyoshi wrote the Shodan-chiyo and** the\r\nBummei Ittoki; Fujiwara Noritane compiled the Teio-keizu; Otsuki\r\nMasabumi lectured on the analects and Urabe Kanetomo expounded the\r\nstandard literature of the East.\r\n\r\n*The Embroidered Brocade Discourse.\r\n\r\n**Rustic Ideals of Government.\r\n\r\nYet, side by side with these patrons of learning stood a general\r\npublic too ignorant to write its own name. Military men, who formed\r\nthe bulk of the nation, were engrossed with the art of war and the\r\nscience of intrigue to the exclusion of all erudition. The priests\r\nwere always available to supply any need, and the priests utilized\r\nthe occasion. Nevertheless, it stands to the credit of these bonzes\r\nthat they made no attempt to monopolize erudition. Their aim was to\r\npopularize it. They opened temple-seminaries (tera-koya) and exercise\r\nhalls (dojo) where youths of all classes could obtain instruction and\r\nwhere an excellent series of text-books was used, the Iroha-uta* the\r\nDoji-kyo, the Teikin-orai** and the Goseibai-shikimoku.*** The\r\nDoji-kyo has been translated by Professor Chamberlain (in Vol. VIII\r\nof the \"Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan\"). A few\r\nextracts will serve to show the nature of the ethical teaching given\r\nto Japanese children in medieval days:\r\n\r\n*A syllabary of moral precepts like the ethical copy-books of\r\nOccidentals.\r\n\r\n**A model letter-writer.\r\n\r\n***The criminal laws of Hojo Yasutoki. All these text-books remained\r\nin use until the Meiji era.\r\n\r\nLet nothing lead thee into breaking faith with thy friend, and depart\r\nnot from thy word. It is the tongue that is the root of misfortunes;\r\nif the mouth were made like unto the nose, a man would have no\r\ntrouble till his life's end. In the house where virtue is accumulated\r\nthere will surely be superabundant joy. No man is worthy of honour\r\nfrom his birth; 'tis the garnering-up of virtue that bringeth him\r\nwisdom and virtue; the rich man may not be worthy of honour. In thin\r\nraiment on a winter's night, brave the cold and be reading the whole\r\nnight through; with scanty fare on a summer's day, repel hunger and\r\nbe learning the whole day long. . . . A father's loving kindness is\r\nhigher than the mountains; a mother's bounty is deeper than the sea.\r\n. . . He that receiveth benefits and is not grateful is like unto the\r\nbirds that despoil the branches of the trees they perch on. . . .\r\nAbove all things, men must practise charity; it is by almsgiving that\r\nwisdom is fed; less than all things, men must grudge money; it is by\r\nriches that wisdom is hindered. . . . The merit of an alms given with\r\na compassionate heart to one poor man is like unto the ocean; the\r\nrecompense of alms given to a multitude for their own sake is like\r\nunto a grain of poppy-seed.\r\n\r\nThis text-book, the Doji-kyo, was compiled by a priest, Annen, who\r\nlived in the second half of the ninth century. Its origin belongs,\r\ntherefore, to a much more remote era than that of the Muromachi\r\nshoguns, but, in common with the other text-books enumerated above,\r\nits extensive use is first mentioned in the Ashikaga epoch. The Five\r\nTemples of Kyoto--to be spoken of presently--were seats of learning;\r\nand many names of the littérateurs that flourished there have been\r\nhanded down. Not the least celebrated were Gido and Zekkai, who paid\r\nseveral visits to China, the fountain-head of ideographic lore. But\r\nthese conditions were not permanent. The Onin War created a serious\r\ninterruption. Kyoto was laid in ruins, and rare books lay on the\r\nroadside, no one caring to pick them up.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nThroughout the Ashikaga period the Kyoto university existed in name\r\nonly, and students of Japanese literature in the provinces\r\ndisappeared. A few courtiers, as Nakahara, Dye, Sugawara, Miyoshi,\r\netc., still kept up the form of lecturing but they did not receive\r\nstudents at large. Nevertheless, a few military magnates, retaining\r\nsome appreciation of the value of erudition, established schools and\r\nlibraries. Among these, the Kanazawa-bunko and the Ashikaga-gakko\r\nwere the most famous. The former had its origin in the closing years\r\nof the Kamakura Bakufu. It was founded during the reign of Kameyama\r\n(1260-1274) by Sanetoki, grandson of Hojo Yoshitoki. A large\r\ncollection of Chinese and Japanese works filled its shelves, and all\r\ndesirous of studying had free access. Akitoki, son of Sanetoki,\r\nadopted Kanazawa as his family name and added largely to the library.\r\nHe caused the ideographs Kanazawa-bunko to be stamped in black on all\r\nConfucian works, and in red on Buddhist.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in the Hojo Kudaiki that men of all classes, laymen\r\nand priests alike, were shut up daily in this library where they\r\nstudied gratis, and that Akitoki's son, Sadaaki, was as ardent a\r\nstudent as his father, so that men spoke of him as well fitted to be\r\nregent (shikken), thus showing that literary skill was counted a\r\nqualification for high office. Fire, the destroyer of so many fine\r\nrelics of Japanese civilization, visited this library more than once,\r\nbut during the reign of Go-Hanazono (1429-1464) it was restored and\r\nextended by the Uesugi family, who also rebuilt and endowed schools\r\nfor the study of Japanese literature in the province of Kotsuke.\r\nAmong these schools was the Ashikaga-gakko, under the presidency of a\r\npriest, Kaigen, in the day of whose ninth successor, Kyuka, the\r\npupils attending the schools totalled three thousand. A few great\r\nfamilies patronized literature without recourse to priests. This was\r\nnotably the case with the Ouchi, whose tradal connexions gave them\r\nspecial access to Chinese books. Ouchi Yoshitaka, in particular,\r\ndistinguished himself as an author. He established a library which\r\nremained for many generations; he sent officials to China to procure\r\nrare volumes, and it is incidentally mentioned that he had several\r\nmanuscripts printed in the Middle Kingdom, although the art of\r\nblock-printing had been practised in Japan since the close of the\r\neighth century. A composition which had its origin at this epoch was\r\nthe yokyoku, a special kind of libretto for mimetic dances. Books on\r\nart also were inspired by the Higashiyama craze for choice specimens\r\nof painting, porcelain, and lacquer. Commentaries, too, made their\r\nappearance, as did some histories, romances, and anthologies.\r\n\r\nPICTORIAL ART\r\n\r\nAs Japan during the Ashikaga period sat at the feet of the Sung\r\nmasters in philosophy and literature, so it was in the realm of art.\r\nThere is, indeed, a much closer relation between literature and\r\npictorial art in China than in any Occidental country, for the two\r\npursuits have a common starting-point--calligraphy. The ideograph is\r\na picture, and to trace it in such a manner as to satisfy the highest\r\ncanons is a veritably artistic achievement. It has been shown above\r\nthat in the Muromachi era the priests of Buddha were the channels\r\nthrough which the literature and the philosophy of Sung reached\r\nJapan, and it will presently be seen that the particular priests who\r\nimported and interpreted this culture were those of the Zen sect.\r\nThere is natural sequence, therefore, in the facts that these same\r\npriests excelled in calligraphy and introduced Japan to the pictorial\r\nart of the immortal Sung painters.\r\n\r\nThere were in China, at the time of the Ashikaga, two schools of\r\npainters: a Northern and a Southern. The term is misleading, for the\r\ndistinction was really not one of geography but one of method. What\r\ndistinguished the Southern school was delicacy of conception,\r\ndirectness of execution, and lightness of tone. To produce a maximum\r\nof effect with a minimum of effort; to suggest as much as to depict,\r\nand to avoid all recourse to heavy colours--these were the cardinal\r\ntenets of the Southern school. They were revealed to Japan by a\r\npriest named Kao, who, during the reign of Go-Daigo (1318-1339),\r\npassed ten years in China, and returning to Kyoto, opened a studio in\r\nthe temple Kennin-ji, where he taught the methods of Li Lungmin of\r\nthe Sung dynasty and Yen Hui of the Yuan. He revolutionized Japanese\r\nart. After him Mincho is eminent. Under the name of Cho Densu--the\r\nAbbot Cho--he acquired perpetual fame by his paintings of Buddhist\r\nsaints.\r\n\r\nBut Mincho's religious pictures did not help to introduce the Sung\r\nacademy to Japan. That task was reserved for Josetsu--a priest of\r\nChinese or Japanese origin--who, during the second half of the\r\nfourteenth century, became the teacher of many students at the temple\r\nShokoku-ji, in Kyoto. Among his pupils was Shubun, and the latter's\r\nfollowers included such illustrious names as Sotan, Sesshu, Shinno;\r\nMasanbbu, and Motonobu. It is to this day a question whether Japan\r\never produced greater artists than Sesshu and Motonobu. To the same\r\ngalaxy belongs Tosa no Mitsunobu, the founder of the Tosa school as\r\nMotonobu was of the Kano. That official patronage was extended to\r\nthese great men is proved by the fact that Mitsunobu was named\r\npresident of the E-dokoro, or Court Academy of Painting; and Motonobu\r\nreceived the priestly rank of hogen.\r\n\r\nAPPLIED ART\r\n\r\nIndustries in general suffered from the continual wars of the\r\nAshikaga epoch, but the art of forging swords flourished beyond all\r\nprecedent. Already Awadaguchi, Bizen, Osafune, and others had\r\nattained celebrity, but for Okazaki Masamune, of Kamakura, who worked\r\nduring the reign of Go-Daigo (1318-1339) was reserved the renown of\r\npeerlessness. His long travels to investigate the methods of other\r\nmasters so as to assimilate their best features, are historically\r\nrecorded, and at the head of the great trinity of Japanese\r\nswordsmiths his name is placed by universal acclaim, his companions\r\nbeing Go no Yoshihiro and Fujiwara Yoshimitsu.* In Muromachi days so\r\nmuch depended on the sword that military men thought it worthy of all\r\nhonour. A present of a fine blade was counted more munificent than a\r\ngift of a choice steed, and on the decoration of the scabbard, the\r\nguard, and the hilt extraordinary skill was expended. Towards the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century, a wonderful expert in metals, Goto\r\nYujo, devoted himself to the production of these ornaments, and his\r\ndescendants perpetuated his fame down to the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The Gotos, however, constitute but a small section of the\r\nhost of masters who will always be remembered in this branch of art.\r\nIn the Muromachi period alone we have such names as Aoki Kaneiye,\r\nMyochin Nobuiye, Umetada Akihisa and others.** Armour making also was\r\ncarried to a point of high achievement during the epoch, especially\r\nby Nobuiye.***\r\n\r\n*Chamberlain in Things Japanese says: \"Japanese swords excel even the\r\nvaunted products of Damascus and Toledo. To cut through a pile of\r\ncopper coins without nicking the blade is, or was, a common feat.\r\nHistory, tradition, and romance alike re-echo with the exploits of\r\nthis wonderful weapon.\"\r\n\r\n**For an exhaustive analysis see Brinkley's China and Japan.\r\n\r\n***See Conder's History of Japanese Costume; Vol. IX. of the\r\n\"Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan.\"\r\n\r\nLACQUER\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that the Japanese surpass all nations in the\r\nart of making lacquer. They not only developed the processes to a\r\ndegree unknown to their original teacher, China, but they also\r\nintroduced artistic features of great beauty. Unfortunately, history\r\ntransmits the names of Jew masters in this line. We can only say that\r\nin the days of Yoshimasa's shogunate, that is, during the second half\r\nof the fifteenth century, several choice varieties began to be\r\nmanufactured, as the nashiji, the togidashi, the negoro-nuri, the\r\nkonrinji-nuri, the shunkei-nuri, the tsuishu, and the tsuikoku.\r\nChoice specimens received from later generations the general epithet\r\nHigashiyama-mono, in reference to the fact that they owed so much to\r\nthe patronage of Yoshimasa in his mansion at Higashi-yama.\r\n\r\nPORCELAIN AND FAIENCE\r\n\r\nTo the Muromachi epoch belongs also the first manufacture of faience,\r\nas distinguished from unglazed pottery, and of porcelain, as\r\ndistinguished from earthenware. The former innovation is ascribed--as\r\nalready noted--to Kato Shirozaemon, a native of Owari, who visited\r\nChina in 1223 and studied under the Sung ceramists; the latter, to\r\nShonzui, who also repaired to China in 1510, and, on his return, set\r\nup a kiln at Arita, in Hizen, where he produced a small quantity of\r\nporcelain, using materials obtained from China, as the existence of\r\nJapanese supplies was not yet known. The faience industry found many\r\nfollowers, but its products all bore the somewhat sombre impress of\r\nthe cha-no-yu (tea ceremonial) canons.\r\n\r\nARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\nThe architectural feature of the time was the erection of\r\ntea-parlours according to the severe type of the cha-no-yu cult. Such\r\nedifices were remarkable for simplicity and narrow dimensions. They\r\npartook of the nature of toys rather than of practical residences,\r\nbeing, in fact, nothing more than little chambers, entirely\r\nundecorated, where a few devotees of the tea ceremonial could meet\r\nand forget the world. As for grand structures like the \"Silver\r\nPavilion\" of Yoshimasa and the \"Golden Pavilion\" of Yoshimitsu, they\r\nshowed distinct traces of Ming influence, but with the exception of\r\nelaborate interior decoration they do not call for special comment.\r\n\r\nA large part of the work of the Japanese architect consisted in\r\nselecting rare woods and uniquely grown timber, in exquisite joinery,\r\nand in fine plastering. Display and ornament in dwelling-houses were\r\nnot exterior but interior; and beginning with the twelfth century,\r\ninterior decoration became an art which occupied the attention of the\r\ngreat schools of Japanese painters. The peculiar nature of Japanese\r\ninterior division of the house with screens or light partitions\r\ninstead of walls lent itself to a style of decoration which was quite\r\nas different in its exigencies and character from Occidental mural\r\ndecorations as was Japanese architecture from Gothic or Renaissance.\r\nThe first native school of decorative artists was the Yamato-ryu,\r\nfounded in the eleventh century by Fujiwara Motomitsu and reaching\r\nthe height of its powers in the twelfth century. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury Fujiwara Tsunetaka, a great painter of this school, took the\r\ntitle of Tosa. Under him the Tosa-ryu became the successor of the\r\nYamato-ryu and carried on its work with more richness and charm. The\r\nTosa school was to a degree replaced after the fifteenth century in\r\ninterior painting by the schools of Sesshu and Kano.\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\nAs one of Yoritomo's first acts when he organized the Kamakura Bakufu\r\nhad been to establish at Tsurugaoka a shrine to Hachiman (the god of\r\nWar), patron deity of the Minamotos' great ancestor, Yoshiiye, so\r\nwhen Takauji, himself a Minamoto, organized the Muromachi Bakufu, he\r\nworshipped at the Iwashimizu shrine of Hachiman, and all his\r\nsuccessors in the shogunate followed his example. Of this shrine\r\nTanaka Harukiyo was named superintendent (betto), and with the\r\nAshikaga leader's assistance, he rebuilt the shrine on a sumptuous\r\nscale, departing conspicuously from the austere fashion of pure\r\nShinto.* It may, indeed, be affirmed that Shinto had never been\r\nregarded as a religion in Japan until, in the days of the Nara Court,\r\nit was amalgamated with Buddhism to form what was called\r\nRyobu-shinto. It derived a further character of religion from the\r\ntheory of Kitabatake Chikafusa, who contended that Shinto, Buddhism,\r\nand Confucianism were all capable of being welded into one whole.\r\nMoreover, in the Muromachi period, the eminent scholar, Ichijo\r\nKaneyoshi (1402-81), wrote a thesis which gave some support to the\r\nviews of Chikafusa.\r\n\r\n*The shrine covered a space of 400 square yards and had a golden\r\ngutter, 80 feet long, 13 feet wide, and over 1 inch thick.\r\n\r\nBut, during the reign of Go-Tsuchimikado (1465-1500), Urabe Kanetomo,\r\nprofessing to interpret his ancestor, Kanenobu, enunciated the\r\ndoctrine of Yuiitsu-shinto (unique Shinto), namely, that as between\r\nthree creeds, Shinto was the root; Confucianism, the branches, and\r\nBuddhism, the fruit. This was the first explicit differentiation of\r\nShinto. It found favour, and its propounder's son, Yoshida, asserted\r\nthe principles still more strenuously. The fact is notable in the\r\nhistory of religion in Japan. Yoshida was the forerunner of Motoori,\r\nHirata, and other comparatively modern philosophers who contended for\r\nthe revival of \"Pure Shinto.\" Many Japanese annalists allege that\r\nShinto owes its religious character solely to the suggestions of\r\nBuddhism, and point to the fact that the Shinto cult has never been\r\nable to inspire a great exponent.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: BELL TOWER OF TODAI-JI\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Ashikaga towards Buddhism was even more\r\nreverential. They honoured the Zen sect almost exclusively. Takauji\r\nbuilt the temple Tenryu-ji, in Kyoto, and planned to establish a\r\ngroup of provincial temples under the name of Ankoku-ji. There\r\ncan be little doubt that his animating purpose in thus acting\r\nwas to create a counterpoise to the overwhelming strength of the\r\nmonasteries of Nara and Hiei-zan. The latter comprised three thousand\r\nbuildings--temples and seminaries--and housed a host of soldier-monks\r\nwho held Kyoto at their mercy and who had often terrorized the city\r\nand the palace. In the eighth century, when the great temple,\r\nTodai-ji, was established at Nara, affiliated temples were built\r\nthroughout the provinces, under the name of Kokubun-ji.\r\n\r\nIt was in emulation of this system that Takauji erected the Tenryu-ji\r\nand planned a provincial net-work of Ankoku-ji. His zeal in the\r\nmatter assumed striking dimensions. On the one hand, he levied heavy\r\nimposts to procure funds; on the other, he sent to China ships--hence\r\ncalled Tenryuji-bune--to obtain furniture and fittings. Thus, in the\r\nspace of five years, the great edifice was completed (1345), and\r\nthere remained a substantial sum in the Muromachi treasury. The monks\r\nof Enryaku-ji (Hiei-zan) fathomed Takauji's purpose. They flocked\r\ndown to the capital, halberd in hand and sacred car on shoulder, and\r\ntruculently demanded of the Emperor that Soseki, high priest of the\r\nnew monastery, should be exiled and the edifice destroyed. But the\r\nAshikaga leader stood firm. He announced that if the soldier-monks\r\npersisted, their lord-abbot should be banished and their property\r\nconfiscated; before which evidently earnest menaces the mob of friars\r\nturned their faces homeward. Thereafter, Takauji, and his brother\r\nTadayoshi celebrated with great pomp the ceremony of opening the new\r\ntemple, and the Ashikaga leader addressed to the priest, Soseki, a\r\ndocument pledging his own reverence and the reverence of all his\r\nsuccessors at Muromachi. But that part of his programme which related\r\nto the provincial branch temples was left incomplete. At no time,\r\nindeed, were the provinces sufficiently peaceful and sufficiently\r\nsubservient for the carrying out of such a plan by the Ashikaga.\r\n\r\nGREAT PRIESTS\r\n\r\nThe priest Soseki--otherwise called \"Muso Kokushi,\" or \"Muso, the\r\nnational teacher\"--was one of the great bonzes in an age when many\r\nmonasteries were repositories of literature and statesmanship. His\r\npupils, Myoo and Chushin, enjoyed almost equal renown in the days of\r\nthe third Ashikaga shogun, Yoshimitsu, whose piety rivalled that of\r\nTakauji. He assigned to them a residence in the Rokuon-ji, his own\r\nfamily temple, and there he visited them to hear discourses on\r\nBuddhist doctrine and to consult about administrative affairs. A\r\nstill more illustrious bonze was Ryoken, of Nanzen-ji. It is related\r\nof him that he repaired, on one occasion, to the Kita-yama palace of\r\nthe shogun Yosh mitsu, wearing a ragged garment. Yoshimitsu at once\r\nchanged his own brocade surcoat for the abbot's torn vestment, and\r\nsubsequently, when conducting his visitor on a boating excursion, the\r\nshogun carried the priest's footgear. It is not possible for a\r\nJapanese to perform a lowlier act of obeisance towards another than\r\nto be the bearer of the latter's sandals. Yoshimitsu was in a\r\nposition to dictate to the Emperor, yet he voluntarily performed a\r\nmenial office for a friar.\r\n\r\nThese four priests, Soseki, Myoo, Chushin, and Ryoken, all belonged\r\nto the Zen sect. The doctrines of that sect were absolutely paramount\r\nin Muromachi days, as they had been in the times of the Kamakura\r\nBakufu. A galaxy of distinguished names confronts us on the pages of\r\nhistory--Myocho of Daitoku-ji; Gen-e of Myoshin-ji; Ikkyu Zenji of\r\nDaitoku-ji, a descendant of the Emperor Go-Komatsu; Tokuso of\r\nNanzen-ji; Shiren of Tofuku-ji; Shushin of Nanzen-ji; Juo of\r\nMyoshin-ji; Tetsuo of Daitoku-ji, and Gazan of Soji-ji. All these\r\nwere propagandists of Zen-shu doctrine. It has been well said that\r\nthe torch of religion burns brightest among dark surroundings. In\r\ncircumstances of tumultuous disorder and sanguinary ambition, these\r\ngreat divines preached a creed which taught that all worldly things\r\nare vain and valueless. Moreover, the priests themselves did not\r\npractise the virtues they inculcated. They openly disregarded their\r\nvow of chastity; bequeathed their temples and manors to their\r\nchildren; employed hosts of stoled soldiers; engaged freely in the\r\nfights of the era, and waxed rich on the spoils of their arms.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of Kenju (called also Rennyo Shoniri), eighth\r\nsuccessor of Shinran, that his eloquence brought him not only a crowd\r\nof disciples but also wealth comparable with that of a great\r\nterritorial magnate; that he employed a large force of armed men, and\r\nthat by dispensing with prohibitions he made his doctrine popular.\r\nThis was at the close of the fifteenth century when Yoshimasa\r\npractised dilettanteism at Higashi-yama. It became in that age a\r\ncommon habit that a man should shave his head and wear priest's\r\nvestments while still taking part in worldly affairs. The distinction\r\nbetween bonze and layman disappeared. Some administrative officials\r\nbecame monks; some daimyo fought wearing sacerdotal vestments over\r\ntheir armour, and some priests led troops into battle. If a bonze\r\nearned a reputation for eloquence or piety, he often became the\r\ntarget of jealous violence at the hands of rival sectarians and had\r\nto fly for his life from the ruins of a burning temple. Not until the\r\nadvent of Christianity, in the middle of the sixteenth century, did\r\nthese outrages cease.\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE TEMPLES OF KYOTO\r\n\r\nThe Zen sect had been almost equally popular during the epoch of the\r\nHojo. They built for it five great temples in Kamakura, and that\r\nexample was followed by the Ashikaga in Kyoto. The five fanes in the\r\ncapital were called collectively, Go-zan. They were Kennin-ji,\r\nTofuku-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenryu-ji, and Shokoku-ji. After the conclusion\r\nof peace between the Northern and Southern Courts the temple\r\nShokoku-ji was destroyed by fire and it remained in ashes until the\r\ntime of Yoshimasa, when the priest, Chushin, persuaded the shogun to\r\nundertake the work of reconstruction. A heavy imposition of land-tax\r\nin the form of tansen, and extensive requisitions for timber and\r\nstones brought funds and materials sufficient not only to restore the\r\nedifice and to erect a pagoda 360 feet high, but also to replenish\r\nthe empty treasury of the shogun. Thus, temple-building enterprises\r\non the part of Japanese rulers were not prompted wholly by religious\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nThe frugal austerity of life under the rule of the Hojo was changed\r\nto lavish extravagance under the Ashikaga. Yet things should have\r\nbeen otherwise, for in Takauji's time there was enacted and\r\npromulgated the code of regulations already referred to as the Kemmu\r\nShikimoku, wherein were strictly forbidden basara, debauchery,\r\ngambling, reunions for tea drinking and couplet composing, lotteries,\r\nand other excesses. Basara is a Sanskrit term for costly luxuries of\r\nevery description, and the compilers of the code were doubtless\r\nsincere in their desire to popularize frugality. But the Ashikaga\r\nrulers themselves did not confirm their precepts by example. They\r\nseemed, indeed, to live principally for sensuous indulgence.\r\n\r\nA Japanese writer of the fifteenth century, in a rhapsodical account\r\nof the Kyoto of his day, dwells on the wonderful majesty of the\r\n\"sky-piercing roofs\" and \"cloud-topping balconies\" of the Imperial\r\npalace. And he points with evident pride to the fact that this\r\nsplendor--a splendor only a little less--was to be found besides in\r\nmany other elegant residences which displayed their owners' taste and\r\nwealth. The chronicler notes that even those who were not noble,\r\nincluding some who had made their money by fortune-telling or by the\r\npractice of medicine, were sometimes able to make such display, to\r\nlive in pretentious houses and have many servants. So could the\r\nprovincial nobles, who it seems did not in other periods make much of\r\na showing at the capital.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers in these mansions lived up to their environment. The\r\ndegree of their refinement may be inferred from the fact that cooking\r\nbecame a science; they had two principal academies and numerous rules\r\nto determine the sizes and shapes of every implement and utensil, as\r\nwell as the exact manner of manipulating them. The nomenclature was\r\nnot less elaborate. In short, to become a master of polite\r\naccomplishments and the cuisine in the military era of Japan demanded\r\npatient and industrious study.\r\n\r\nMODE OF TRAVELLING\r\n\r\nThe fashions of the Heian epoch in the manner of travelling underwent\r\nlittle change during the military age. The principal conveyance\r\ncontinued to be an ox-carriage or a palanquin. The only notable\r\naddition made was the kago, a kind of palanquin slung on a single\r\npole instead of on two shafts. The kago accommodated one person and\r\nwas carried by two. Great pomp and elaborate organization attended\r\nthe outgoing of a nobleman, and to interrupt a procession was counted\r\na deadly crime, while all persons of lowly degree were required to\r\nkneel with their hands on the ground and their heads resting on them\r\nas a nobleman and his retinue passed.\r\n\r\nLANDSCAPE GARDENING\r\n\r\nGreat progress was made in the art of landscape gardening during the\r\nMuromachi epoch, but this is a subject requiring a volume to itself.\r\nHere it will suffice to note that, although still trammelled by its\r\nChinese origin, the art received signal extension, and was converted\r\ninto something like an exact science, the pervading aim being to\r\nproduce landscapes and water-scapes within the limits of a\r\ncomparatively small park without conveying any sense of undue\r\nrestriction. Buddhist monks developed signal skill in this branch of\r\nesthetics, and nothing could exceed the delightful harmony which they\r\nachieved between nature and art. It may be mentioned that the first\r\ntreatise on the art of landscape gardening appeared from the pen of\r\nGokyogoku Yoshitsune in the beginning of the thirteenth century. It\r\nhas been well said that the chief difference between the parks of\r\nJapan and the parks of Europe is that, whereas the latter are planned\r\nsolely with reference to a geometrical scale of comeliness or in pure\r\nand faithful obedience to nature's indications, the former are\r\nintended to appeal to some particular mood or to evoke special\r\nemotion, while, at the same time, preserving a likeness to the\r\nlandscapes and water-scapes of the world about us.\r\n\r\nMINIATURE LANDSCAPE GARDENING\r\n\r\nBy observing the principles and practical rules of landscape\r\ngardening while reducing the scale of construction so that a\r\nlandscape or a water-scape, complete in all details and perfectly\r\nbalanced as to its parts, is produced within an area of two or three\r\nsquare feet, the Japanese obtained a charming development of the\r\ngardener's art. Admirable, however, as are these miniature\r\nreproductions of natural scenery and consummate as is the skill\r\ndisplayed in bringing all their parts into exact proportion with the\r\nscale of the design, they are usually marred by a suggestion of\r\ntriviality. In this respect, greater beauty is achieved on an even\r\nsmaller scale by dwarfing trees and shrubs so that, in every respect\r\nexcept in dimensions, they shall be an accurate facsimile of what\r\nthey would have been had they grown for cycles unrestrained in the\r\nforest. The Japanese gardener \"dwarfs trees so that they remain\r\nmeasurable only by inches after their age has reached scores, even\r\nhundreds, of years, and the proportions of leaf, branch and stem are\r\npreserved with fidelity. The pots in which these wonders of patient\r\nskill are grown have to be themselves fine specimens of the\r\nkeramist's craft, and as much as £200 is sometimes paid for a notably\r\nwell-trained tree.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, article \"Japan,\" Brinkley.\r\n\r\nTEA CEREMONIAL\r\n\r\nThe tea ceremonial (cha-no-yu) is essentially Japanese in its\r\ndevelopments though its origin came from China. It has been well\r\ndescribed as \"a mirror in which the extraordinary elaborations of\r\nJapanese social etiquette may be seen vividly reflected.\" In fact,\r\nthe use of tea as a beverage had very little to do with the refined\r\namusement to which it was ultimately elevated. The term \"tasting\"\r\nwould apply more accurately to the pastime than \"drinking.\" But even\r\nthe two combined convey no idea of the labyrinth of observances which\r\nconstituted the ceremonial. The development of the cha-no-yu is\r\nmainly due to Shuko, a priest of the Zen sect of Buddhism, who seems\r\nto have conceived that tea drinking might be utilized to promote the\r\nmoral conditions which he associated with its practice. Prof. H. B.\r\nChamberlain notes that \"It is still considered proper for tea\r\nenthusiasts to join the Zen sect of Buddhism, and it is from\r\nthe abbot of Daitokuji at Kyoto that diplomas of proficiency\r\nare obtained.\" The bases of Shuko's system were the four\r\nvirtues--urbanity, purity, courtesy, and imperturbability--and little\r\nas such a cult seemed adapted to the practices of military men, it\r\nnevertheless received its full elaboration under the feudal system.\r\nBut although this general description is easy enough to formulate,\r\nthe etiquette and the canons of the cha-no-yu would require a whole\r\nvolume for an exhaustive description.\r\n\r\nINCENSE COMPARING\r\n\r\nThe Muromachi epoch contributed to aristocratic pastimes the growth\r\nof another amusement known as ko-awase, \"comparing of incense,\" a\r\ncontest which tested both the player's ability to recognize from\r\ntheir odour different varieties of incense and his knowledge of\r\nancient literature. As early as the seventh century the use of\r\nincense had attained a wide vogue in Japan. But it was not until the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century that Shino Soshin converted the\r\npastime into something like a philosophy. From his days no less than\r\nsixty-six distinct kinds of incense were recognized and distinguished\r\nby names derived from literary allusions. This pastime is not so\r\nelaborate as the cha-no-yu, nor does it furnish, like the latter, a\r\nseries of criteria of art-objects. But it shows abundant evidence of\r\nthe elaborate care bestowed upon it by generation after generation of\r\nJapanese dilettanti.\r\n\r\nIKE-BANA\r\n\r\nThe English language furnishes no accurate equivalent for what the\r\nJapanese call ike-bana. The literal meaning of the term is \"living\r\nflower,\" and this name well explains the fundamental principle of the\r\nart, namely, the arrangement of flowers so as to suggest natural\r\nlife. In fact, the blossoms must look as though they were actually\r\ngrowing and not as though they were cut from the stems. It is here\r\nthat the fundamental difference between the Occidental and the\r\nJapanese method of flower arrangement becomes apparent; the former\r\nappeals solely to the sense of colour, whereas the latter holds that\r\nthe beauty of a plant is not derived from the colour of its blossoms\r\nmore than from the manner of their growth. In fact, harmony of colour\r\nrather than symmetry of outline was the thing desired in a Japanese\r\nfloral composition. It might be said that Western art, in general,\r\nand more particularly the decorative art of India, Persia and\r\nGreece--the last coming to Japan through India and with certain Hindu\r\nmodifications--all aim at symmetry of poise; but that Japanese floral\r\narrangement and decorative art in general have for their fundamental\r\naim a symmetry by suggestion,--a balance, but a balance of\r\ninequalities. The ike-bana as conceived and practised in Japan is a\r\nscience to which ladies, and gentlemen also, devote absorbing\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nOTHER PASTIMES\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that to the pastimes mentioned above as\r\noriginating in military times must be added others bequeathed from\r\nprevious eras. Principal among these was \"flower viewing\" at all\r\nseasons; couplet composing; chess; draughts; football; mushroom\r\npicking, and maple-gathering parties, as well as other minor\r\npursuits. Gambling, also, prevailed widely during the Muromachi epoch\r\nand was carried sometimes to great excesses, so that samurai actually\r\nstaked their arms and armour on a cast of the dice. It is said that\r\nthis vice had the effect of encouraging robbery, for a gambler staked\r\nthings not in his possession, pledging himself to steal the articles\r\nif the dice went against him.\r\n\r\nSINGING AND DANCING\r\n\r\nOne of the chief contributions of the military era to the art of\r\nsinging was a musical recitative performed by blind men using the\r\nfour-stringed Chinese lute, the libretto being based on some episode\r\nof military history. The performers were known as biwa-bozu, the name\r\n\"bozu\" (Buddhist priest) being derived from the fact that they shaved\r\ntheir heads after the manner of bonzes. These musicians developed\r\nremarkable skill of elocution, and simulated passion so that in\r\nsucceeding ages they never lost their popularity. Sharing the vogue\r\nof the biwa-bozu, but differing from it in the nature of the story\r\nrecited as well as in that of the instrument employed, was the\r\njoruri, which derived its name from the fact that it was originally\r\nfounded on the tragedy of Yoshitsune's favourite mistress, Joruri. In\r\nthis the performer was generally a woman, and the instrument on which\r\nshe accompanied herself was the samisen. These two dances may be\r\ncalled pre-eminently the martial music of Japan, both by reason of\r\nthe subject and the nature of the musical movement.\r\n\r\nThe most aristocratic performance of all, however, was the yokyoku,\r\nwhich ultimately grew into the no. This was largely of dramatic\r\ncharacter and it owed its gravity and softness of tone to priestly\r\ninfluence, for the monopoly of learning possessed in those ages by\r\nthe Buddhist friars necessarily made them pre-eminent in all literary\r\naccomplishments. The no, which is held in just as high esteem to-day\r\nas it was in medieval times, was performed on a stage in the open air\r\nand its theme was largely historical. At the back of the stage was\r\nseated a row of musicians who served as chorus, accompanying the\r\nperformance with various instruments, chiefly the flute and the drum,\r\nand from time to time intoning the words of the drama. An adjunct of\r\nthe no was the kyogen. The no was solemn and stately; the kyogen\r\ncomic and sprightly. In fact, the latter was designed to relieve the\r\nheaviness of the former, just as on modern stages the drama is often\r\nrelieved by the farce. It is a fact of sober history that the shogun\r\nYoshimasa officially invested the no dance with the character of a\r\nceremonious accomplishment of military men and that Hideyoshi himself\r\noften joined the dancers on the stage.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FLOWER POTS AND DWARF TREE\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SWORDS PRESERVED AT SHOSO-IN TEMPLE, AT NARA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE EPOCH OF WARS (Sengoku Jidai)\r\n\r\nLIST OF EMPERORS\r\n\r\nOrder of Succession   Name            Date\r\n\r\n97th Sovereign        Go-Murakami   A.D. 1339-1368\r\n\r\n98th                  Chokei             1368-1372\r\n\r\n99th                  Go-Kameyama        1372-1392\r\n\r\n100th                 Go-Komatsu         1392-1412\r\n\r\n101st                 Shoko              1412-1428\r\n\r\n102d                  Go-Hanazono        1428-1465\r\n\r\n103d                  Go-Tsuchimikado    1465-1500\r\n\r\n104th                 Go-Kashiwabara     1500-1526\r\n\r\n105th                 Go-Nara            1526-1557\r\n\r\n106th                 Okimachi           1557-1586\r\n\r\n107th                 Go-Yozei           1586-1611\r\n\r\nTHE sovereigns of the Northern Court, not being recognized as\r\nlegitimate by Japanese annalists, are excluded from the above list.\r\nGo-Komatsu, however, is made an exception. He reigned from 1382 to\r\n1392 as representing the Northern Court, and thereafter, the two\r\nCourts having ceased their rivalry, he reigned undisputed until 1412.\r\nIt has further to be noted that many histories make the number of\r\nsovereigns greater by two than the figures recorded in the lists of\r\nthis volume. That is because the histories in question count as two\r\nthe Empresses Kogyoku (642-645) and Saimei (655-661), although they\r\nrepresent the same sovereign under different names, and because they\r\nadopt a similar method of reckoning in the case of the Empresses\r\nKoken (749-758) and Shotoku (765-770), whereas in this volume the\r\nactual number of sovereigns is alone recorded.\r\n\r\nTHE COURT\r\n\r\nThe interval between the close of the fifteenth century and the end\r\nof the sixteenth is set apart by Japanese annalists as the most\r\ndisturbed period of the country's history and is distinguished by the\r\nterm Sengoku Jidai, or the Epoch of Wars. It would be more accurate\r\nto date the beginning of that evil time from the Onin year-period\r\n(1467-1469); for in the Onin era practical recognition was extended\r\nto the principle that the right of succession to a family estate\r\njustifies appeal to arms, and that such combats are beyond the\r\npurview of the central authority. There ensued disturbances\r\nconstantly increasing in area and intensity, and not only involving\r\nfinally the ruin of the Ashikaga shogunate but also subverting all\r\nlaw, order, and morality. Sons turned their hand against fathers,\r\nbrothers against brothers, and vassals against chiefs. Nevertheless,\r\namid this subversion of ethics and supremacy of the sword, there\r\nremained always some who reverenced the Throne and supported the\r\ninstitutions of the State; a noteworthy feature in the context of the\r\nfact that, except during brief intervals, the wielder of the sceptre\r\nin Japan never possessed competence to enforce his mandates but was\r\nalways dependent in that respect on the voluntary co-operation of\r\ninfluential subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the Sengoku period the fortunes of the Imperial Court fell to\r\ntheir lowest ebb. The Crown lands lay in the provinces of Noto, Kaga,\r\nEchizen, Tamba, Mino, and so forth, and when the wave of warfare\r\nspread over the country, these estates passed into the hands of\r\nmilitary magnates who absorbed the taxes into their own treasuries,\r\nand the collectors sent by the Court could not obtain more than a\r\nsmall percentage of the proper amount. The exchequer of the Muromachi\r\nBakufu suffered from a similar cause, and was further depleted by\r\nextravagance, so that no aid could be obtained from that source. Even\r\nworse was the case with the provincial manors of the Court nobles,\r\nwho were ultimately driven to leave the capital and establish direct\r\nconnexion with their properties. Thus, the Ichijo family went to\r\nTosa; the Ane-no-koji to Hida, and when Ouchi Yoshioki retired to\r\nSuwo on resigning his office (kwanryo), many Court magnates who had\r\nbenefitted by his generosity in Kyoto followed him southward.\r\n\r\nSo impoverished was the Imperial exchequer that, in the year 1500,\r\nwhen the Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado died, the corpse lay for forty days\r\nin a darkened room of the palace, funds to conduct the funeral rites\r\nnot being available. Money was finally provided by Sasaki Takayori,\r\nand in recognition of his munificence he was authorized to use the\r\nImperial crest (chrysanthemum and Paulownia); was granted the right\r\nof entree to the palace, and received an autographic volume from the\r\npen of the Emperor Go-Kogon. If there was no money to bury\r\nGo-Tsuchimikado, neither were any funds available to perform the\r\ncoronation of his successor, Go-Kashiwabara. Muromachi made a futile\r\nattempt to levy contributions from the daimyo, and the kwanryo,\r\nHosokawa Masamoto, is recorded to have brusquely said, in effect,\r\nthat the country could be administered without crowning any\r\nsovereign. Twenty years passed before the ceremony could be\r\nperformed, and means were ultimately (1520) furnished by the Buddhist\r\npriest Koken--son of the celebrated Rennyo Shonin, prelate of the\r\nShin sect--who, out of the abundant gifts of his disciples, placed at\r\nthe disposal of the Court a sum of ten thousand gold ryo,* being\r\nmoved to that munificence by the urging of Fujiwara Sanetaka, a\r\nformer nai-daijin. In recognition of this service, Koken was raised\r\nto high ecclesiastical rank.\r\n\r\n*£30,000--$145,000.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, early in this sixteenth century,\r\nYoshioki, deputy kwanryo and head of the great Ouchi house, had\r\ncontributed large sums to the Muromachi treasury; had contrived the\r\nrestoration of several of the Court nobles' domains to their\r\nimpoverished owners, and had assisted with open hand to relieve the\r\npenury of the throne. The task exhausted his resources, and when\r\nrecalled to his province by local troubles in 1518, the temporary\r\nalleviation his generosity had brought was succeeded by hopeless\r\npenury. From time immemorial it had been the universal rule to\r\nrebuild the two great shrines at Ise every twentieth year, but\r\nnothing of the kind had been possible in the case of the Naigu (inner\r\nshrine) since 1462, and in the case of the Gegu (outer shrine) since\r\n1434. Such neglect insulted the sanctity of the Throne; yet appeals\r\nto the Bakufu produced no result. In 1526, the Emperor Go-Kashiwabara\r\ndied. It is on record that his ashes were carried from the\r\ncrematorium in a box slung from the neck of a general officer, and\r\nthat the funeral train consisted of only twenty-six officials. For\r\nthe purposes of the coronation ceremony of this sovereign's\r\nsuccessor, subscriptions had to be solicited from the provincial\r\nmagnates, and it was not until 1536 that the repairs of the palace\r\ncould be undertaken, so that the Emperor Go-Nara was able to write in\r\nhis diary, \"All that I desired to have done has been accomplished,\r\nand I am much gratified.\" On this occasion the Ouchi family again\r\nshowed its generosity and its loyalty to the Throne.\r\n\r\nThe extremity of distress was reached during the Kyoroku era\r\n(1528-1531), when the struggle between the two branches of the\r\nHosokawa family converted Kyoto once more into a battle-field and\r\nreduced a large part of the city to ashes. The Court nobles, with\r\ntheir wives and children, had to seek shelter and refuge within the\r\nImperial palace, the fences of which were broken down and the\r\nbuildings sadly dilapidated.\r\n\r\nA contemporary record tells with much detail the story of the decay\r\nof the capital and the pitiful plight of the Throne. The Emperor\r\nGo-Nara (1527-1557) was reduced to earning his own living. This he\r\ndid by his skill as a calligrapher--at least one instance of\r\nsomething useful resulting from the penchant of the Court for the\r\nniceties of Chinese art and letters. Any one might leave at the\r\npalace a few coins for payment and order a fair copy of this or that\r\nexcerpt from a famous classic. The palace was overrun, the chronicler\r\nsays. Its garden became a resort for tea-drinking among the lower\r\nclasses and children made it a play-ground. It was no longer walled\r\nin, but merely fenced with bamboo. The whole city was in a similar\r\ndesolation, things having become worse and worse beginning with the\r\nOnin disturbance of 1467 and the general exodus of the samurai from\r\nthe capital at that time. At this time the military nobles came to\r\nthe city only to fight, and the city's population melted away. All\r\nwas disorder. The city was flooded and the dike which was built to\r\ncheck the flooded rivers came to be thought a fine residence place in\r\ncomparison with lower parts of the town.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that men might be observed begging for rice in\r\nthe streets of the capital. They carried bags to receive\r\ncontributions which were designated kwampaku-ryo (regent's money).\r\nSome of the bags thus used are preserved by the noble family of Nijo\r\nto this day. Another record says that the stewardess of the Imperial\r\nhousehold service during this reign (Go-Nara), on being asked how\r\nsummer garments were to be supplied for the ladies-in-waiting,\r\nreplied that winter robes with their wadded linings removed should be\r\nused. The annals go so far as to allege that deaths from cold and\r\nstarvation occurred among the courtiers. An important fact is that\r\none of the provincial magnates who contributed to the succour of the\r\nCourt at this period was Oda Nobuhide of Owari, father of the\r\ncelebrated Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SHINRAN SHONIN\r\n\r\nBUDDHIST VIOLENCE\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Muromachi Bakufu's authority encouraged the monks\r\nas well as the samurai to become a law to themselves. Incidental\r\nreferences have already been made to this subject, but the religious\r\ncommotions of the Sengoku period invite special attention. The\r\nBuddhists of the Shin sect, founded by Shinran Shonin (1184-1268),\r\nwhich had for headquarters the great temple Hongwan-ji in Kyoto, were\r\nfrom the outset hostile to the monks of Enryaku-ji. Religious\r\ndoctrine was not so much concerned in this feud as rivalry. Shinran\r\nhad been educated in the Tendai tenets at Enryaku-ji. Therefore, from\r\nthe latter's point of view he was a renegade, and while vehemently\r\nattacking the creed of his youth, he had acquired power and influence\r\nthat placed the Hongwan-ji almost on a level with the great Hiei-zan.\r\nIn the days of Kenju, popularly called Rennyo Shonin (1415-1479),\r\nseventh in descent from the founder, Shinran, the Ikko--by which name\r\nthe Shin sect was known--developed conspicuous strength. Kenju\r\npossessed extraordinary eloquence. Extracts from his sermons were\r\nprinted on an amulet and distributed among worshippers, who grew so\r\nnumerous and so zealous that the wealth of the sect became enormous,\r\nand its leaders did not hesitate to provide themselves with an armed\r\nfollowing. Finally the monks of Hiei-zan swept down on Hongwan-ji,\r\napplied the torch to the great temple, and compelled the abbot,\r\nKenju, to fly for his life.\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the time that this outrage received no\r\npunishment. Kenju escaped through Omi to Echizen, where the high\r\nconstable, an Asakura, combining with the high constable, a Togashi,\r\nof the neighbouring province of Kaga, erected a temple for the\r\nfugitive abbot, whose favour was well worth courting. The Ikko-shu,\r\nhowever, had its own internal dissensions. In the province of Kaga, a\r\nsub-sect, the Takata, endeavoured to oust the Hongwan disciples, and\r\nrising in their might, attacked (1488) the high constable; compelled\r\nhim to flee; drove out their Takata rivals; invaded Etchu; raided\r\nNoto, routing the forces of the high constable, Hatakeyama Yoshizumi;\r\nseized the three provinces--Kaga, Noto, and Etchu--and attempted to\r\ntake possession of Echizen. This wholesale campaign was spoken of as\r\nthe Ikko-ikki (revolt of Ikko). A few years later, the Shin believers\r\nin Echizen joined these revolters, and marched through the province,\r\nlooting and burning wherever they passed. No measure of secular\r\nwarfare had been more ruthless than were the ways of these monks. The\r\nhigh constable, Asakura Norikage, now took the field, and after\r\nfierce fighting, drove back the fanatics, destroyed their temples,\r\nand expelled their priests.\r\n\r\nThis was only one of several similar commotions. So turbulent did the\r\nmonks show themselves under the influence of Shin-shu teachers that\r\nthe Uesugi of Echigo, the Hojo of Izu, and other great daimyo\r\ninterdicted the propagandism of that form of Buddhism altogether. The\r\nmost presumptuous insurrection of all stands to the credit of the\r\nOsaka priests. A great temple had been erected there to replace the\r\nHongwan-ji of Kyoto, and in, 1529, its lord-abbot, Kokyo, entered\r\nKaga, calling himself the \"son of heaven\" (Emperor) and assigning to\r\nhis steward, Shimoma Yorihide, the title of shogun. This was called\r\nthe \"great revolt\" (dai-ikki), and the movement of opposition\r\nprovoked by it was termed the \"small revolt\" (sho-ikki). Again\r\nrecourse was had to the most cruel methods. Men's houses were robbed\r\nand burned simply because their inmates stood aloof from the\r\ninsurrection. Just at that time the septs of Hosokawa and Miyoshi\r\nwere engaged in a fierce struggle for supremacy. Kokyo threw in his\r\nlot with Hosokawa Harumoto, and, at the head of fifty thousand\r\ntroops, attacked and killed Miyoshi Motonaga. Very soon, however, the\r\nHosokawa chief fell out with his cassocked allies. But he did not\r\nventure to take the field against them single handed. The priests of\r\nthe twenty-one Nichiren temples in Kyoto, old enemies of the Ikko,\r\nwere incited to attack the Hongwan-ji in Osaka. This is known in\r\nhistory as the Hokke-ikki, Hokke-shu being the name of the Nichiren\r\nsect. Hiei-zan was involved in the attack, but the warlike monks of\r\nEnryaku-ji replied by pouring down into the capital, burning the\r\ntwenty-one temples of the Nichiren and butchering three thousand of\r\ntheir priests. Such were the ways of the Buddhists in the Sengoku\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nTHE KWANTO\r\n\r\nDuring the Sengoku period (1490-1600) the Japanese empire may be\r\ncompared to a seething cauldron, the bubbles that unceasingly rose to\r\nthe surface disappearing almost as soon as they emerged, or uniting\r\ninto groups with more or less semblance of permanence. To follow in\r\ndetail these superficial changes would be a task equally interminable\r\nand fruitless. They will therefore be traced here in the merest\r\noutline, except in cases where large results or national effects are\r\nconcerned. The group of eight provinces called collectively Kwanto\r\nfirst claims attention as the region where all the great captains and\r\nstatesmen of the age had their origin and found their chief sphere of\r\naction. It has been seen that the fifth Ashikaga kwanryo, Shigeuji,\r\ndriven out of Kamakura, took refuge at Koga in Shimotsuke; that he\r\nwas thenceforth known as Koga Kubo; that the Muromachi shogun,\r\nYoshimasa, then sent his younger brother, Masatomo, to rule in the\r\nKwanto; that he established his headquarters at Horigoe in Izu, and\r\nthat he was officially termed Horigoe Gosho. His chief retainers were\r\nthe two Uesugi families--distinguished as Ogigayatsu Uesugi and\r\nYamanouchi Uesugi, after the names of the palaces where their\r\nmansions were situated--both of whom held the office of kwanryo\r\nhereditarily.\r\n\r\nThese Uesugi families soon engaged in hostile rivalry, and the\r\nOgigayatsu branch, being allied with Ota Dokwan, the founder of Yedo\r\nCastle, gained the upper hand, until the assassination of Dokwan,\r\nwhen the Yamanouchi became powerful. It was at this time--close of\r\nthe fifteenth century--that there occurred in the Horigoe house one\r\nof those succession quarrels so common since the Onin era. Ashikaga\r\nMasatomo, seeking to disinherit his eldest son, Chachamaru, in favour\r\nof his second son, Yoshimichi, was killed by the former, the latter\r\ntaking refuge with the Imagawa family in Suruga, by whom he was\r\nescorted to the capital, where he became the Muromachi shogun under\r\nthe name of Yoshizumi. Parricides and fratricides were too common in\r\nthat disturbed age for Chachamaru's crime to cause any moral\r\ncommotion. But it chanced that among the rear vassals of the Imagawa\r\nthere was one, Nagauji, who, during many years, had harboured designs\r\nof large ambition. Seizing the occasion offered by Chachamaru's\r\ncrime, he constituted himself Masatomo's avenger, and marching into\r\nIzu, destroyed the Horigoe mansion, and killed Chachamaru. Then\r\n(1491) Nagauji quietly took possession of the province of Izu,\r\nbuilding for himself a castle at Hojo. He had no legal authority of\r\nany kind for the act, neither command from the Throne nor commission\r\nfrom the shogun.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: HOJO SOUN\r\n\r\nIt was an act of unqualified usurpation. Yet its perpetrator showed\r\nthat he had carefully studied all the essentials of stable\r\ngovernment--careful selection of official instruments; strict\r\nadministration of justice; benevolent treatment of the people, and\r\nthe practice of frugality. Being descended from the Taira of Ise and\r\nhaving occupied the domains long held by the Hojo, he adopted the uji\r\nname of \"Hojo,\" and having extended his conquests to Sagami province,\r\nbuilt a strong castle at Odawara. He is often spoken of as Soun, the\r\nname he adopted in taking the tonsure, which step did not in any\r\ndegree interfere with his secular activities. A profoundly skilled\r\ntactician, he never met with a military reverse, and his fame\r\nattracted adherents from many provinces. His instructions to his son\r\nUjitsuna were characteristic. Side by side with an injunction to hold\r\nhimself in perpetual readiness for establishing the Hojo sway over\r\nthe whole of the Kwanto, as soon as the growing debility of the\r\nUesugi family offered favourable opportunity, stood a series of rules\r\nelementary almost to affectation: to believe in the Kami; to rise\r\nearly in the morning; to go to bed while the night is still young,\r\nand other counsels of cognate simplicity formed the ethical thesaurus\r\nof a philosopher wise enough to formulate the astute maxim that a\r\nruler, in choosing his instruments, must remember that they, too,\r\nchoose him.\r\n\r\nUjitsuna proved himself a worthy son of Soun, but much had still to\r\nbe accomplished before the Kwanto was fully won. Among the eight\r\nprovinces, two, Awa and Kazusa, which looked across the sea to\r\nOdawara, were under the firm sway of the Satomi family--one of the\r\n\"eight generals\" of the Kwanto--and not until 1538 could the Hojo\r\nchief find an opportunity to crush this strong sept. The fruits of\r\nhis victory had hardly been gathered when death overtook him, in\r\n1543. His sword descended, however, to a still greater leader, his\r\nson Ujiyasu, who pushed westward into Suruga; stood opposed to Kai in\r\nthe north, and threatened the Uesugi in the east. The two branches of\r\nthe Uesugi had joined hands in the presence of the Hojo menace, and a\r\npowerful league including the Imagawa and the Ashikaga of Koga, had\r\nbeen formed to attack the Hojo. So long did they hesitate in view of\r\nthe might of Odawara, that the expression \"Odawara-hyogi\" passed into\r\nthe language as a synonym for reluctance; and when at length they\r\nmoved to the attack with eighty thousand men, Hojo Ujiyasu, at the\r\nhead of a mere fraction of that number, inflicted a defeat which\r\nsettled the supremacy of the Kwanto.\r\n\r\nThe name of Hojo Ujiyasu is enshrined in the hearts of Japanese\r\nbushi. He combined in an extraordinary degree gentleness and bravery,\r\nmagnanimity and resolution, learning and martial spirit. It was\r\ncommonly said that from the age of sixteen he had scarcely doffed his\r\narmour; had never once showed his back to a foe, and had received\r\nnine wounds all in front.* Before he died (1570) he had the\r\nsatisfaction of establishing a double link between the Hojo and the\r\nhouse of the great warrior, Takeda Shingen, a son and a daughter from\r\neach family marrying a daughter and a son of the other.**\r\n\r\n*Thus a frontal wound came to be designated by his name.\r\n\r\n**The present Viscount Hojo is a descendant of Ujiyasu.\r\n\r\nTHE TAKEDA AND THE UESUGI\r\n\r\nDescended (sixteenth generation) from Minamoto Yoshimitsu, Takeda\r\nHarunobu (1521-1573) took the field against his father, who had\r\nplanned to disinherit him in favour of his younger brother. Gaining\r\nthe victory, Harunobu came into control of the province of Kai, which\r\nhad long been the seat of the Takeda family. This daimyo, commonly\r\nspoken of as Takeda Shingen, the latter being the name he took on\r\nreceiving the tonsure, ranks among Japan's six great captains of the\r\nsixteenth century, the roll reading thus:\r\n\r\n   Takeda Shingen     (1521-1573)\r\n\r\n   Uesugi Kenshin     (1530-1578)\r\n\r\n   Hojo Ujimasa       (1538-1590)\r\n\r\n   Oda Nobunaga       (1534-1582)\r\n\r\n   Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-1598)\r\n\r\n   Tokugawa Ieyasu    (1542-1616)\r\n\r\nThe second of the above, Uesugi Kenshin, was not member of the great\r\nUesugi family which took such an important part in the affairs of the\r\nKwanto. He belonged to the Nagao, which originally stood in a\r\nrelation of vassalage to the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi in\r\nEchigo, and his father attained an independent position. Kagetora, as\r\nKenshin was called in his youth, found himself engaged in his\r\ntwenty-first year in a contest with his elder brother, whom he\r\nkilled, and, by way of penance for the fratricide, he took the\r\ntonsure under the name of Kenshin and would have retired from the\r\nworld had not his generals insisted on his remaining in command. It\r\nwas at this time that Kenshin became a member of the Uesugi sept. In\r\n1505, the two branches of the Kwanto Uesugi joined hands against\r\ntheir common enemy, Hojo Soun, and from that time the contest was\r\ncontinued until 1551, when Ujiyasu, grandson of Soun, drove Uesugi\r\nNorimasa from his castle of Hirai in Kotsuke. The vanquished general\r\nfled to Echigo to seek succour from his family's old-time vassal,\r\nNagao Kagetora, already renowned under the name of Kenshin. Norimasa\r\nbestowed the office of kwanryo as well as the uji of Uesugi on\r\nKenshin, who thenceforth became known as Uesugi Kenshin, and who thus\r\nconstituted himself the foe of the Hojo. At a somewhat earlier date,\r\nKenshin had been similarly supplicated by Murakami Yoshikiyo, whose\r\ncastle was at Kuzuo in Shinano, whence he had been driven by Takeda\r\nShingen.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: UESUGI KENSHIN\r\n\r\nIt thus fell out that Uesugi Kenshin had for enemies the two captains\r\nof highest renown in his era, Hojo Ujimasa and Takeda Shingen. This\r\norder of antagonism had far-reaching effects. For Kenshin's ambition\r\nwas to become master of the whole Kwanto, under pretence of\r\nre-establishing the original Uesugi, but his expansion southward from\r\nEchigo was barred by Shingen in Shinano and Kai, and his expansion\r\neastward by the Hojo in Sagami and Musashi. The place of the struggle\r\nbetween Shingen-and Kenshin was Kawanaka-jima, an arena often\r\npictured by artists of later generations and viewed to-day by\r\npilgrims to the venerable temple, Zenko-ji. There the two generals,\r\nrecognized as the two greatest strategists of that epoch, met four\r\ntimes in fierce strife, and though a Japanese historian compares the\r\nstruggle to the eruption of volcanoes or the blowing of gales of\r\nblood, victory never rested on either standard.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TAKEDA SHINGEN\r\n\r\nPeace having been at length restored for a moment, in 1558, Kenshin\r\nvisited Kyoto in the following year. There he was received with\r\ndistinction. The Emperor--Okimachi--bestowed on him a sword, and the\r\nshogun, Yoshiteru, entitled him to incorporate the ideograph \"teru\"\r\nin his name, which was thus changed from Kagetora to Terutora. He was\r\nalso granted the office of kwanryo. On his return to Echigo, Kenshin\r\nproceeded to assert his new title. Mustering an army said to have\r\nbeen 110,000 strong, he attacked the Hojo in Odawara. But Ujiyasu\r\nwould not be tempted into the open. He remained always behind the\r\nramparts, and, in the meanwhile incited Shingen to invade Echigo, so\r\nthat Kenshin had to raise the siege of Odawara and hasten to the\r\ndefence of his home province. There followed another indecisive\r\nbattle at Kawanaka-jima, and thereafter renewed attacks upon the\r\nHojo, whose expulsion from the Kwanto devolved on Kenshin as kwanryo.\r\nBut the results were always vague: the Hojo refrained from final\r\nresistance, and Shingen created a diversion. The chief sufferers were\r\nthe provinces of the Kwanto, a scene of perpetual battle. In the end,\r\nafter Etchu and Kotsuke had been brought under Kenshin's sway, peace\r\nwas concluded between him and the Hojo, and he turned his full\r\nstrength against his perennial foe, Shingen. But at this stage the\r\nsituation was entirely changed by the appearance of Oda Nobunaga on\r\nthe scene, as will be presently narrated. It is recorded that, on the\r\neve of his death, Shingen advised his son to place himself and his\r\ndomains in Kenshin's keeping, for, said he, \"Kenshin now stands\r\nunrivalled, and Kenshin will never break faith with you;\" and it is\r\nrecorded of Kenshin that when he heard of Shingen's death, he shed\r\ntears and exclaimed, \"Would that the country had such another hero!\"*\r\n\r\n*The present Count Uesugi is descended from Kenshin.\r\n\r\nTHE IMAGAWA, THE KITABATAKE, THE SAITO, AND THE ODA FAMILIES\r\n\r\nThe Imagawa, a branch of the Ashikaga, served as the latter's bulwark\r\nin Suruga province during many generations. In the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century the head of the family was Yoshimoto. His sway\r\nextended over the three provinces of Suruga, Totomi, and Mikawa,\r\nwhich formed the littoral between Owari Bay and the Izu promontory.\r\nOn the opposite side of Owari Bay lay Ise province, the site of the\r\nprincipal Shinto shrine and the original domain of the Taira family,\r\nwhere, too, the remnants of the Southern Court had their home. Its\r\nhereditary governor was a Kitabatake, and even after the union of the\r\ntwo Courts that great family, descendants of the immortal historian\r\nand philosopher, Chikafusa, continued to exercise sway. But, in 1560,\r\ndiscord among the chief retainers of the sept furnished a pretext for\r\nthe armed intervention of Oda Nobunaga, who invested his son,\r\nNobukatsu, with the rights of government. On the northern littoral of\r\nOwari Bay, and therefore separating Ise and Mikawa, was situated the\r\nprovince of Owari, which, in turn, opened on the north into Mino. In\r\nthis latter province the Doki family was destroyed by the Saito, and\r\nthese in turn were crushed by the Oda, in 1561, who, from their\r\nheadquarters in Owari, shattered the Imagawa of Mikawa and the Saito\r\nin Mino, thereafter sweeping over Ise.\r\n\r\nTHE ROKKAKU, THE ASAI, THE ASAKURA, AND THE HATAKEYAMA FAMILIES\r\n\r\nThe province of Omi had special importance as commanding the\r\napproaches to Kyoto from the east. Hence it became the scene of much\r\ndisturbance, in which the Hosokawa, the Kyogoku, the Rokkaku, and the\r\nAsai families all took part. Finally, in the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the Asai gained the ascendancy by obtaining the assistance\r\nof the Asakura of Echizen. This latter province, conterminous with\r\nthe north of Omi, was originally under the control of the Shiba\r\nfamily, but the Asakura subsequently obtained the office of high\r\nconstable, and acquired a great access of power at the time of the\r\nIkko revolt by driving the turbulent priests from the province. At\r\nthat era, or a little later, the provinces of Kii, Kawachi, Izumi,\r\nand Yamato were all the scenes of fierce fighting, but the pages of\r\nhistory need not be burdened with details of the clash of purely\r\nprivate ambitions.\r\n\r\nTHE MORI AND THE AMAKO FAMILIES\r\n\r\nThe Ouchi family was very powerfully situated. Descended from a\r\nKorean Crown Prince who migrated to Japan early in the seventh\r\ncentury, its representative, Yoshioki (1477-1528), controlled the\r\nsouthern provinces of the main island--Iwami, Aki, Suwo, and\r\nNagato--as well as the two northern provinces of Kyushu--Chikuzen and\r\nBuzen. This was the chieftain who, in 1508, marched to Kyoto at the\r\nhead of a great army, and restored the Ashikaga shogun Yoshitane,\r\nhimself receiving the office of kwanryo. Eleven years later, on his\r\nreturn to the south, he was followed by many nobles from Kyoto, and\r\nhis chief provincial town, Yamaguchi, on the Shimonoseki Strait,\r\nprospered greatly. But his son Yoshitaka proved a weakling, and being\r\ndefeated by his vassal, Suye Harukata--called also Zenkyo--he\r\ncommitted suicide, having conjured another vassal, Mori Motonari, to\r\navenge him.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MORI MOTONARI\r\n\r\nThe Mori family* had for ancestor the great statesman and legislator\r\nof Yoritomo's time, Oye Hiromoto, and its representative, Motonari\r\n(1497-1571), had two sons scarcely inferior to himself in strategical\r\nability, Kikkawa Motoharu and Kohayakawa Takakage. A commission\r\nhaving been obtained from Kyoto, Motonari took the field in 1555, and\r\nwith only three thousand men succeeded, by a daring feat, in\r\nshattering Harukata with twenty thousand. Thus far, Mori Motonari had\r\nobeyed the behest of his late chief. But thereafter he made no\r\nattempt to restore the Ouchi family. On the contrary, he relentlessly\r\nprosecuted the campaign against Suye Harukata, with whom was\r\nassociated Ouchi Yoshinaga, representing the Ouchi house by adoption,\r\nuntil ultimately Yoshinaga committed suicide and, the Ouchi family\r\nbecoming extinct, Motonari succeeded to all its domains.\r\n\r\n*Now represented by Prince Mori.\r\n\r\nAt that time the province of Izumo, which is conterminous with Iwami\r\nalong its western frontier, was under the control of the high\r\nconstable, Amako Tsunehisa (1458-1540), who, profiting by the fall of\r\nthe great Yamana sept, had obtained possession of the provinces Bingo\r\nand Hoki as well as of the Oki Islands. This daimyo was a puissant\r\nrival of the Ouchi family, and on the downfall of the latter he soon\r\ncame into collision with Mori Motonari. Tsunehisa's grandson,\r\nYoshihisa (1545-1610), inherited this feud, which ended with the\r\nextinction of the Amako family and the absorption of its domains by\r\nthe Mori, the latter thus becoming supreme in no less than thirteen\r\nprovinces of the Sanyo-do and the Sanin-do.\r\n\r\nTHE MIYOSHI, THE ICHIJO, THE CHOSOKABE, AND THE KONO FAMILIES\r\n\r\nWith the island of Shikoku (four provinces) are connected the names\r\nof the Hosokawa, the Miyoshi, the Ichijo, the Chosokabe, and the Kono\r\nfamilies. Early in the fourteenth century, the celebrated Hosokawa\r\nYoriyuki was banished to Sanuki, and in the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury we find nearly the whole of the island under the sway of\r\nHosokawa Katsumoto. Then, in the Daiei era (1521-1528), the Miyoshi,\r\nvassals of the Hosokawa, came upon the scene in Awa. From 1470 to\r\n1573, the province of Tosa was governed by the Ichijo, but, in the\r\nlatter year, Motochika, head of the Chosokabe, one of the seven\r\nvassal families of the Ichijo, usurped the province, and then\r\nreceived orders from Oda Nobunaga to conquer the other three\r\nprovinces of the island in the interests of Nobunaga's son. Motochika\r\nobeyed, but on the death of Nobunaga and his son he constituted\r\nhimself master of Shikoku until Hideyoshi deprived him of all save\r\nTosa. From 1156 to 1581 the Kono family held the province of Iyo, but\r\nthere is nothing of historical interest in their career.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIMYO IN KYUSHU\r\n\r\nConnected with Kyushu are the families of Shoni, Otomo, Ryuzoji,\r\nKikuchi and Shimazu. The term \"shoni\" originally signified\r\nvice-governor. Its first bearer was Muto Sukeyori (Fujiwara), who\r\nreceived the commission of Dazai no shoni from Minamoto Yoritomo.\r\nSubsequently it became a family name, and the Shoni are found\r\nfighting against the Mongol invaders; stoutly supporting the Southern\r\nCourt; passing over to the side of the Ashikaga, and losing their\r\nplaces in history after the suicide of Tokihisa (1559), who had\r\nsuffered repeated defeats at the hands of the Ryuzoji.\r\n\r\nThe Otomo family was a branch of the Fujiwara. One of its members,\r\nNakahara Chikayoshi, received from Minamoto Yoritomo the office of\r\nhigh constable of the Dazai-fu, and to his son, Yoshinao, was given\r\nthe uji of Otomo, which, as the reader knows, belonged originally to\r\nMichi no Omi, a general of the Emperor Jimmu. In Kyushu, the Otomo\r\nespoused the cause of the Northern Court, and made themselves masters\r\nof Buzen, Bungo, Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, and Higo. In 1396, the\r\nhead of the family--Chikayo--held the office of tandai of Kyushu.\r\nYoshishige, commonly called Sorin (1530-1587), fought successfully\r\nwith the Kikuchi and the Akizuki, and the closing years of his life\r\nwere devoted to a futile struggle against the Shimazu, the Ryuzoji,\r\nand the Akizuki. He escaped disaster by obtaining succour from\r\nHideyoshi, but the Otomo domain was reduced to the single province of\r\nBungo.\r\n\r\nThe Ryuzoji first appear in history as vassals of the Shoni, under\r\nwhose banner they fought against the Otomo, in 1506. Subsequently\r\nthey became independent and established a stronghold in Hizen, which\r\nprovince was granted to them in fief by Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nThe Kikuchi, a branch of the Fujiwara, held office in Kyushu from the\r\ntenth century. They are chiefly noteworthy for their gallant defence\r\nof the cause of the Southern Court. After many vicissitudes the\r\nfamily disappeared from history in the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe ancestor of the Shimazu family was Tadahisa, an illegitimate son\r\nof Minamoto Yoritomo. His mother, to escape the resentment of\r\nYoritomo's wife, Masa, fled to Kyushu, and Tadahisa, having been\r\nnamed governor of Satsuma, proceeded thither, in 1196, and by\r\nconquest added to it the two provinces, Hyuga and Osumi. The Shimazu\r\nfamily emerged victorious from all campaigns until Hideyoshi in\r\nperson took the field against them, as will be presently related.*\r\n\r\n*The family is now represented by Prince Shimazu.\r\n\r\nTHE O-U REGION\r\n\r\nThe 0-U region (Mutsu-Dewa) was the home of many septs which fought\r\namong themselves for supremacy. Of these the most influential were\r\nthe Mogami of Yamagata, the Date of Yonezawa, and the Ashina of Aizu.\r\nIn the extreme north were the Nambu who, however, lived too remote\r\nfrom the political centres to occupy historical attention. The Date\r\nmaintained friendly relations with the Ashikaga, and Harumune was\r\nnominated tandai of Oshu by the shogun Yoshiharu, of whose name one\r\nideograph (haru) was given to the Date chief. The family attained its\r\ngreater distinction in the time of Masamune (1566-1636), and was\r\nfortunate in being able to stand aloof from some of the internecine\r\nstrife of the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, the region was\r\nsufficiently disturbed. Thus, the Tsugaru and the Nambu struggled in\r\nthe north, while the Date, further north, shattered the power of the\r\nNikaido, the Nihonmatsu, the Ashina, and the Tamura, or fought less\r\ndecisively against the Satake (of Hitachi), and in Ushu (Dewa) the\r\nMogami were confronted by the Uesugi of Echigo.\r\n\r\nDATE MASAMUNE\r\n\r\nThe most renowned of the Date family was Masamune, who to great\r\nmilitary skill added artistic instincts and considerable poetic\r\nability. Tradition has handed down some incidents which illustrate\r\nthe ethics of that time as well as the character of the man. It is\r\nstated that Masamune came into possession of a scroll on which were\r\ninscribed a hundred selected poems copied by the celebrated Fujiwara\r\nIetaka. Of this anthology Masamune was much enamoured, for the sake\r\nalike of its contents and of its calligraphy. But learning\r\naccidentally that the scroll had been pawned to the merchant from\r\nwhom he had obtained it, he instituted inquiries as to its owner, and\r\nultimately restored the scroll to him with the addition of five gold\r\nryo. The owner was a knight-errant (ronin) named Imagawa Motome, who\r\nthereafter entered Masamune's service and ultimately rose to be a\r\ngeneral of infantry (ashigaru). The sympathy which taught Masamune to\r\nestimate the pain with which the owner of the scroll must have parted\r\nwith it was a fine trait of character. Another incident in this\r\nremarkable man's career happened at an entertainment where he\r\naccidentally trod on the robe of one Kanematsu, a vassal of the\r\nTokugawa. Enraged by an act of carelessness which amounted almost to\r\na deliberate insult, Kanematsu struck Masamune, A commotion at once\r\narose, the probable outcome being that Masamune would return the blow\r\nwith his sword. But he remained pertly cool, making no remark except\r\nthat he had been paid for his want of care, and that, at any rate,\r\nKanematsu was not an adversary worthy of his resentment.\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE CENTRES\r\n\r\nAmong the welter of warring regions glanced at above, five sections\r\ndetach themselves as centres of disturbance. The first is the Court\r\nin Kyoto and the Muromachi Bakufu, where the Hosokawa, the Miyoshi,\r\nand the Matsunaga deluged the streets with blood and reduced the city\r\nto ashes. The second is the Hojo of Odawara, who compassed the\r\ndestruction of the kubo at Koga and of the two original Uesugi\r\nfamilies. The third is Takeda of Kai, who struggled on one side with\r\nthe Uesugi of Echigo and on the other with the Imagawa of Suruga. The\r\nfourth is Oda Nobunaga, who escorted the shogun to the capital. And\r\nthe fifth is the great Mori family, who, after crushing the Ouchi and\r\nthe Amako, finally came into collision with the armies of Oda under\r\nthe leadership of Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"EMA\" (Pictures Painted on Wood, Especially of Horses,\r\nHung up in the Temple as Motive Offerings)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ODA NOBUNAGA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA, HIDEYOSHI, AND IEYASU\r\n\r\nODA NOBUNAGA\r\n\r\nWHEN the Taira sept was shattered finally at Dan-no-ura, a baby\r\ngrandson of Kiyomori was carried by its mother to the hamlet of\r\nTsuda, in Omi province. Subsequently this child, Chikazane, was\r\nadopted by a Shinto official of Oda, in Echizen, and thus acquired\r\nthe name of Oda. For generations the family served uneventfully at\r\nthe shrine in Omi, but in the disturbed days of the Ashikaga shoguns,\r\nthe representative of the eighth generation from Chikazane emerged\r\nfrom the obscurity of Shinto services and was appointed steward\r\n(karo) of the Shiba family, which appointment involved removal of his\r\nresidence to Owari. From that time the fortunes of the family became\r\nbrighter. Nobuhide, its representative at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, acquired sufficient power to dispute the Imagawa's\r\nsway over the province of Mikawa, and sufficient wealth to contribute\r\nfunds to the exhausted coffers of the Court in Kyoto.\r\n\r\nThis man's son was Nobunaga. Born in 1534, and destined to bequeath\r\nto his country a name that will never die, Nobunaga, as a boy, showed\r\nmuch of the eccentricity of genius. He totally despised the canons of\r\nthe time as to costume and etiquette. One of his peculiarities was a\r\nlove of long swords, and it is related that on a visit to Kyoto in\r\nhis youth he carried in his girdle a sword which trailed on the\r\nground as he walked. Rough and careless, without any apparent\r\ndignity, he caused so much solicitude to his tutor and guardian,\r\nHirate Masahide, and showed so much indifference to the latter's\r\nremonstrances, that finally Masahide had recourse to the faithful\r\nvassal's last expedient--he committed suicide, leaving a letter in\r\nwhich the explanation of his act was accompanied by a stirring appeal\r\nto the better instincts of his pupil and ward. This proved the\r\nturning-point in Nobunaga's career. He became as circumspect as he\r\nhad previously been careless, and he subsequently erected to the\r\nmemory of his brave monitor a temple which may be seen to this day by\r\nvisitors to Nagoya.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said of Nobunaga that his indifference to detail and\r\nhis lack of patience were glaring defects in his moral endowment. But\r\nthat accusation can scarcely be reconciled with facts. Thus, when\r\nstill a young man, it is related of him that he summoned one of his\r\nvassals to his presence but, giving no order, allowed the man to\r\nretire. This was repeated with two others, when the third, believing\r\nthat there must be something in need of care, looked about\r\nattentively before retiring, and observing a piece of torn paper on\r\nthe mats, took it up and carried it away. Nobunaga recalled him,\r\neulogized his intelligence, and declared that men who waited\r\nscrupulously for instructions would never accomplish much. The\r\nfaculties of observation and initiation were not more valued by\r\nNobunaga than those of honesty and modesty. It is recorded that on\r\none occasion he summoned all the officers of his staff, and showing\r\nthem a sword by a famous maker, promised to bestow it upon the man\r\nwho should guess most correctly the number of threads in the silk\r\nfrapping of the hilt. All the officers wrote down their guesses with\r\none exception, that of Mori Rammaru. Asked for the reason of his\r\nabstention, Mori replied that he happened to know the exact number of\r\nthreads, having counted them on a previous occasion when admiring the\r\nsword. Nubunaga at once placed the weapon in his hands, thus\r\nrecognizing his honesty. Again, after the construction of the famous\r\ncastle at Azuchi, to which reference will be made hereafter,\r\nNobunaga, desiring to have a record compiled in commemoration of the\r\nevent, asked a celebrated priest, Sakugen, to undertake the\r\ncomposition and penning of the document. Sakugen declared the task to\r\nbe beyond his literary ability, and recommended that it should be\r\nentrusted to his rival, Nankwa. Nobunaga had no recourse but to adopt\r\nthis counsel, and Nankwa performed the task admirably, as the\r\ndocument, which is still in existence, shows. In recognition of this\r\nsuccess, Nobunaga gave the compiler one hundred pieces of silver, but\r\nat the same time bestowed two hundred on Sakugen for his magnanimity\r\nin recommending a rival.\r\n\r\nNobunaga unquestionably had the gift of endearing himself to his\r\nretainers, though there are records which show that he was subject to\r\noutbursts of fierce anger. Even his most trusted generals were not\r\nexempt from bitter words or even blows, and we shall presently see\r\nthat to this fault in his character was approximately due his tragic\r\nend. Nevertheless, he did not lack the faculty of pity. On the\r\noccasion of a dispute between two of his vassals about the boundaries\r\nof a manor, the defeated litigant bribed one of Nobunaga's principal\r\nstaff-officers to appeal for reversal of the judgment. This officer\r\nadduced reasons of a sufficiently specious character, but Nobunaga\r\ndetected their fallacy, and appeared about to take some precipitate\r\naction when he happened to observe the wrinkles which time had\r\nwritten on the suppliant's face. He recovered his sang-froid and\r\ncontented himself with sending the officer from his presence and\r\nsubsequently causing to be handed to him a couplet setting forth the\r\nevils of bribery and corruption. He forgave the guilty man in\r\nconsideration of his advanced age, and the incident is said to have\r\nclosed with the suicide of the old officer. Frugality was another\r\ntrait of Nobunaga's character. But he did not save money for money's\r\nsake. He spent with lavish hand when the occasion called for\r\nmunificence; as when he contributed a great sum for the rebuilding of\r\nthe Ise shrines. Perhaps nothing constitutes a better clue to his\r\ndisposition than the verses he habitually quoted:\r\n\r\n   Life is short; the world is a mere dream to the idle.\r\n   Only the fool fears death, for what is there of life that does\r\n   Not die once, sooner or later?\r\n   Man has to die once and once only;\r\n   He should make his death glorious.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that Nobunaga's demeanour in battle truly reflected\r\nthe spirit of these verses.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI\r\n\r\nNobunaga certainly deserved the success he achieved, but that he\r\nachieved it must be attributed in part to accident. That accident was\r\nhis association with Hideyoshi.* It has been sometimes said that\r\ncircumstances beget the men to deal with them. Fallacious as such a\r\ndoctrine is, it almost compels belief when we observe that the second\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century in Japan produced three of the greatest\r\nmen the world has ever seen, and that they joined hands to accomplish\r\nthe stupendous task of restoring peace and order to an empire which\r\nhad been almost continuously torn by war throughout five consecutive\r\ncenturies. These three men were born within an interval of eight\r\nyears: Nobunaga, in 1534; Hideyoshi, in 1536, and Ieyasu, in 1542.\r\n\r\n*To avoid needless difficulty the name \"Hideyoshi\" is used solely\r\nthroughout this history. But, as a matter of fact, the great\r\nstatesman and general was called in his childhood Nakamura Hiyoshi;\r\nhis adult name was Tokichi; afterwards he changed this to Hashiba and\r\nultimately, he was known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories about Hideyoshi's early days, but the details\r\nare obscured by a record called the Taikoki, which undoubtedly makes\r\nmany excursions into the region of romance. The plain facts appear to\r\nbe that Hideyoshi was the son of a humble farmer named Kinoshita\r\nYaemon, who lived in the Aichi district of Owari province, and who\r\npreferred the life of a foot-soldier (ashigaru) to the pursuit of\r\nagriculture. Yaemon served the Oda family, and died when Hideyoshi\r\nwas still a youth. In Owari province, at a homestead called Icho-mura\r\nfrom the name of the tree (maiden-hair tree) that flourishes there in\r\nabundance, there stands a temple built in the year 1616 on the site\r\nof the house where Hideyoshi was born. This temple is known as\r\nTaiko-zan--\"Taiko\" having been the title of Hideyoshi in the latter\r\nyears of his life--and in the grounds of the temple may be seen the\r\nwell from which water was drawn to wash the newly born baby. The\r\nchild grew up to be a youth of dimunitive stature, monkey-like face,\r\nextraordinary precocity, and boundless ambition. Everything was\r\nagainst him--personal appearance, obscurity of lineage, and absence\r\nof scholarship. Yet he never seems to have doubted that a great\r\nfuture lay before him.\r\n\r\nMany curious legends are grouped about his childhood. They are for\r\nthe most part clumsily constructed and unconvincing, though probably\r\nwe shall be justified in accepting the evidence they bear of a mind\r\nsingularly well ordered and resourceful. At the age of sixteen he was\r\nemployed by a Buddhist priest to assist in distributing amulets, and\r\nby the agency of this priest he obtained an introduction to\r\nMatsushita Yukitsuna, commandant of the castle of Kuno at Hamamatsu,\r\nin Totomi province. This Matsushita was a vassal of Imagawa\r\nYoshimoto. He controlled the provinces of Mikawa, Totomi, and Suruga,\r\nwhich lie along the coast eastward of Owari, and he represented one\r\nof the most powerful families in the country. Hideyoshi served in the\r\ncastle of Kuno for a period variously reckoned at from one year to\r\nfive. Tradition says that he abused the trust placed in him by his\r\nemployer, and absconded with the sum of six ryo wherewith he had been\r\ncommissioned to purchase a new kind of armour which had recently come\r\ninto vogue in Owari province. But though this alleged theft becomes\r\nin certain annals the basis of a picturesque story as to Hideyoshi\r\nrepaying Matsushita a thousandfold in later years, the unadorned\r\ntruth seems to be that Hideyoshi was obliged to leave Kuno on account\r\nof the jealousy of his fellow retainers, who slandered him to\r\nYukitsuna and procured his dismissal.\r\n\r\nReturning to Owari, he obtained admission to the ranks of Oda\r\nNobunaga in the humble capacity of sandal-bearer. He deliberately\r\nchose Nobunaga through faith in the greatness of his destiny, and\r\nagain the reader of Japanese history is confronted by ingenious tales\r\nas to Hideyoshi's devices for obtaining admission to Nobunaga's\r\nhouse. But the most credible explanation is, at the same time, the\r\nsimplest, namely, that Hideyoshi's father, having been borne on the\r\nmilitary roll of Nobunaga's father, little difficulty offered in\r\nobtaining a similar favour for Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nNobunaga was then on the threshold of his brilliant career. In those\r\ndays of perpetual war and tumult, the supreme ambition of each great\r\nterritorial baron in Japan was to fight his way to the capital, there\r\nto obtain from the sovereign and the Muromachi Bakufu a commission to\r\nsubdue the whole country and to administer it as their lieutenant.\r\nNobunaga seems to have cherished that hope from his early years,\r\nthough several much more powerful military magnates would surely\r\noppose anything like his pre-eminence. Moreover, in addition to\r\ncomparative weakness, he was hampered by local inconvenience. The\r\nprovince of Owari was guarded on the south by sea, but on the east it\r\nwas menaced directly by the Imagawa family and indirectly by the\r\ncelebrated Takeda Shingen, while on the north it was threatened by\r\nthe Saito and on the west by the Asai, the Sasaki, and the\r\nKitabatake. Any one of these puissant feudatories would have been\r\nmore than a match for the Owari chieftain, and that Imagawa Yoshimoto\r\nharboured designs against Owari was well known to Nobunaga, for in\r\nthose days spying, slander, forgery, and deceit of every kind had the\r\napproval of the Chinese writers on military ethics whose books were\r\nregarded as classics by the Japanese. Hideyoshi himself figures at\r\nthis very time as the instigator and director of a series of acts of\r\nextreme treachery, by which the death of one of the principal Imagawa\r\nvassals was compassed; and the same Hideyoshi was the means of\r\ndiscovering a plot by Imagawa emissaries to delay the repair of the\r\ncastle of Kiyosu, Nobunaga's headquarters, where a heavy fall of rain\r\nhad caused a landslide. Nobunaga did not venture to assume the\r\noffensive against the Imagawa chief. He chose as a matter of\r\nnecessity to stand on the defensive, and when it became certain that\r\nImagawa Yoshimoto had taken the field, a general impression prevailed\r\nthat the destruction of the Oda family was unavoidable.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF OKEHAZAMA\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto crossed the border into\r\nOwari at the head of a force stated by the annals to have been\r\nforty-six thousand strong. Just two years had elapsed since\r\nHideyoshi's admission to the service of the Owari baron in the office\r\nof sandal-bearer. Nevertheless, some generally credible records do\r\nnot hesitate to represent Hideyoshi as taking a prominent part in the\r\ngreat battle against the Imagawa, and as openly advising Nobunaga\r\nwith regard to the strategy best adapted to the situation. It is\r\nincredible that a private soldier, and a mere youth of twenty-two at\r\nthat, should have risen in such a short time to occupy a place of\r\nequality with the great generals of Nobunaga's army. But that\r\nHideyoshi contributed more or less to the result of the fight may be\r\nconfidently asserted.\r\n\r\nThe battle itself, though the forces engaged were not large, must be\r\ncounted one of the great combats of the world, for had not Nobunaga\r\nemerged victorious the whole course of Japanese history might have\r\nbeen changed. At the outset, no definite programme seems to have been\r\nconceived on Nobunaga's side. He had no allies, and the numerical\r\ninferiority of his troops was overwhelming. The latter defect was\r\nremedied in a very partial degree by the resourcefulness of\r\nHideyoshi. In his boyhood he had served for some time under a\r\ncelebrated chief of freebooters, by name Hachisuka Koroku,* and he\r\npersuaded that chieftain with his fifteen hundred followers to march\r\nto the aid of the Owari army, armour and weapons having been\r\nfurnished by Sasaki Shotei, of Omi province. Sasaki regarded\r\nNobunaga's plight as too hopeless to warrant direct aid, but he was\r\nwilling to equip Hachisuka's men for the purpose, although the\r\naddition of fifteen hundred soldiers could make very little\r\ndifference in the face of such a disparity as existed between the\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\n*Ancestor of the present Marquis Hachisuka.\r\n\r\nShortly before these events, Owari had been invaded from the west by\r\nthe Kitabatake baron, whose domain lay in Ise, and the invaders had\r\nbeen beaten back by a bold offensive movement on Nobunaga's part. The\r\nultimate result had not been conclusive, as Nobunaga advisedly\r\nrefrained from carrying the war into Ise and thus leaving his own\r\nterritory unguarded. But the affair had taught the superiority of\r\noffensive tactics, and thus Nobunaga's impulse was to attack the army\r\nof Imagawa, instead of waiting to be crushed by preponderate force.\r\nHis most trusted generals, Shibata Katsuiye, Sakuma Nobumori, and\r\nHayashi Mitsukatsu, strenuously opposed this plan. They saw no\r\nprospect whatever of success in assuming the offensive against\r\nstrength so superior, and they urged the advisability of yielding\r\ntemporarily and awaiting an opportunity to recover independence.\r\nHere, Hideyoshi is reputed to have shown conspicuous wisdom at the\r\ncouncil-table. He pointed out that there could be no such thing as\r\ntemporary surrender. The Imagawa would certainly insist on hostages\r\nsufficiently valuable to insure permanent good faith, and he further\r\ndeclared that it was a mistake to credit the Imagawa with possessing\r\nthe good-will of any of the other great feudatories, since they were\r\nall equally jealous of one another.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was resolved that seven forts should be built and\r\ngarrisoned, and that five of them should be allowed to fall into the\r\nenemy's hands if resistance proved hopeless. In the remaining two\r\nforts the garrisons were to be composed of the best troops in the\r\nOwari army, and over these strongholds were to be flown the flags of\r\nNobunaga himself and of his chief general. It was hoped that by their\r\nsuccess in five of the forts the Imagawa army would be at once\r\nphysically wearied and morally encouraged to concentrate their entire\r\nstrength and attention on the capture of the last two fortresses.\r\nMeanwhile, Nobunaga himself, with a select body of troops, was to\r\nmarch by mountain roads to the rear of the invading forces and\r\ndeliver a furious attack when such a manoeuvre was least expected.\r\nThe brave men who engaged in this perilous enterprise were\r\nstrengthened by worshipping at the shrine of Hachiman in the village\r\nof Atsuta, and their prayers evoked appearances which were\r\ninterpreted as manifestations of divine assistance. Most fortunately\r\nfor the Owari troops, their movements were shrouded by a heavy\r\nrainfall, and they succeeded in inflicting serious loss on the\r\ninvading army, driving it pele-mele across the border and killing its\r\nchief, Yoshimoto. No attempt was made to pursue the fugitives into\r\nMikawa. Nobunaga was prudently content with his signal victory. It\r\nraised him at once to a level with the greatest provincial barons in\r\nthe empire, and placed him in the foremost rank of the aspirants for\r\nan Imperial commission.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TOKUGAWA IEYASU\r\n\r\nTOKUGAWA IEYASU\r\n\r\nThe battle of Okehazama led to another incident of prime importance\r\nin Japanese history. It brought about an alliance between Oda\r\nNobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Among the small barons subject to the\r\nImagawa there was one called Matsudaira Motoyasu. He had taken the\r\nname, Motoyasu, by adopting one of the ideographs of Yoshimoto's\r\nappellation. His family, long in alliance with the Imagawa, were at a\r\nvariance with the Oda, and in the battle of Okehazama this Motoyasu\r\nhad captured one of the Owari forts. But on the defeat and death of\r\nYoshimoto, the Matsudaira chieftain retired at once to his own castle\r\nof Okazaki, in the province of Mikawa. He had then to consider his\r\nposition, for by the death of Yoshimoto, the headship of the Imagawa\r\nfamily had fallen to his eldest son, Ujizane, a man altogether\r\ninferior in intellect to his gifted father. Nobunaga himself\r\nappreciated the character of the new ruler, and saw that the wisest\r\nplan would be to cement a union with Matsudaira Motoyasu. Accordingly\r\nhe despatched an envoy to Okazaki Castle to consult the wishes of\r\nMotoyasu. The latter agreed to the Owari chief's proposals, and in\r\nFebruary, 1562, proceeded to the castle of Kiyosu, where he\r\ncontracted with Oda Nobunaga an alliance which endured throughout the\r\nlatter's lifetime. In the following year, Motoyasu changed his name\r\nto Ieyasu, and subsequently he took the uji of Tokugawa. The alliance\r\nwas strengthened by intermarriage, Nobuyasu, the eldest son of\r\nIeyasu, being betrothed to a daughter of Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA'S POSITION\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, according to Japanese annalists, that Nobunaga\r\nseriously conceived the ambition of making Kyoto his goal. The\r\nsituation offered inducements. In the presence of a practically\r\nacknowledged conviction that no territorial baron of that era might\r\nventure to engage in an enterprise which denuded his territory of a\r\nprotecting army, it was necessary to look around carefully before\r\nembarking upon the Kyoto project. Nobunaga had crushed the Imagawa,\r\nfor though his victory had not been conclusive from a military point\r\nof view, it had placed the Imagawa under incompetent leadership and\r\nhad thus freed Owari from all menace from the littoral provinces on\r\nthe east. Again, in the direction of Echigo and Shinano, the great\r\ncaptain, Uesugi Kenshin, dared not strike at Nobunaga's province\r\nwithout exposing himself to attack from Takeda Shingen. But Shingen\r\nwas not reciprocally hampered. His potentialities were always an\r\nunknown quality. He was universally recognized as the greatest\r\nstrategist of his time, and if Nobunaga ventured to move westward,\r\nthe Kai baron would probably seize the occasion to lay hands upon\r\nOwari. It is true that the alliance with Tokugawa Ieyasu constituted\r\nsome protection. But Ieyasu was no match for Shingen in the field.\r\nSome other check must be devised, and Nobunaga found it in the\r\nmarriage of his adopted daughter to Shingen's son, Katsuyori.\r\n\r\nTHE COURT APPEALS TO NOBUNAGA\r\n\r\nIn Kyoto, at this time, a state of great confusion existed. The\r\nEmperor Okimachi had ascended the throne in 1557. But in the presence\r\nof the violent usurpations of the Miyoshi and others, neither the\r\nsovereign nor the shogun could exercise any authority, and, as has\r\nbeen shown already, the Throne was constantly in pecuniarily\r\nembarassed circumstances. Nobunaga's father, Nobuhide, had\r\ndistinguished himself by subscribing liberally to aid the Court\r\nfinancially, and this fact being now recalled in the context of\r\nNobunaga's rapidly rising power, the Emperor, in the year 1562,\r\ndespatched Tachiri Munetsugu nominally to worship at the shrine of\r\nAtsuta, but in reality to convey to Nobunaga an Imperial message\r\ndirecting him to restore order in the capital. The Owari baron\r\nreceived this envoy with marked respect. It is recorded that he\r\nsolemnly performed the ceremony of lustration and clothed himself in\r\nhitherto unworn garments on the occasion of his interview with the\r\nenvoy. It was not in his power, however, to make any definite\r\narrangement as to time. He could only profess his humble\r\ndetermination to obey the Imperial behest, and promise the utmost\r\nexpedition. But there can be no doubt that the arrival of this envoy\r\ndecided the question of a march to Kyoto, though some years were\r\ndestined to elapse before the project could be carried out.\r\n\r\nTwo things were necessary, however, namely, a feasible route and a\r\nplausible pretext. Even in those times, when wars were often\r\nundertaken merely for the purpose of deciding personal supremacy,\r\nthere remained sufficient public morality to condemn any baron who\r\nsuffered himself to be guided openly by ambition alone. Some\r\nreasonably decent cause had to be found. Now the Emperor, though, as\r\nabove stated, communicating his will verbally to Nobunaga, had not\r\nsent him any written commission. The necessary pretext was furnished,\r\nhowever, by the relations between the members of the Saito family of\r\nMino province, which lay upon the immediate north of Owari, and\r\nconstituted the most convenient road to Kyoto. Hidetatsu, the head of\r\nthat family, had fought against Nobunaga's father, Nobuhide, and one\r\nof the conditions of peace had been that the daughter of Hidetatsu\r\nshould become the wife of Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Saito household was disturbed by one of the family\r\nfeuds so common during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in\r\nJapan. Hidetatsu, desiring to disinherit his eldest son, Yoshitatsu,\r\nhad been attacked and killed by the latter, and Nobunaga announced\r\nhis intention of avenging the death of his father-in-law. But before\r\nthis intention could be carried out, Yoshitatsu died (1561), and his\r\nson, Tatsuoki, a man of little resource or ability, had to bear the\r\nonset from Owari. Nobunaga, at the head of a large force, crossed the\r\nKiso River into Mino. But he found that, even under the leadership of\r\nTatsuoki, the Mino men were too strong for him, and he was ultimately\r\ncompelled to adopt the device of erecting on the Mino side of the\r\nriver a fortress which should serve at once as a basis of military\r\noperations and as a place for establishing relations with the minor\r\nfamilies in the province. The building of this fort proved a very\r\ndifficult task, but it was finally accomplished by a clever device on\r\nthe part of Hideyoshi, who, a master of intrigue as well as of\r\nmilitary strategy, subsequently won over to Nobunaga's cause many of\r\nthe principal vassals of the Saito family, among them being Takenaka\r\nShigeharu, who afterwards proved a most capable lieutenant to\r\nHideyoshi.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries arranged, Nobunaga once more crossed the Kiso\r\n(1564) at the head of a large army, and after many days of severe\r\nfighting, captured the castle of Inaba-yama, which had been strongly\r\nfortified by Yoshitatsu, and was deemed impregnable. Nobunaga\r\nestablished his headquarters at this castle, changing its name to\r\nGifu, and thus extending his dominion over the province of Mino as\r\nwell as Owari. He had now to consider whether he would push on at\r\nonce into the province of Omi, which alone lay between him and Kyoto,\r\nor whether he would first provide against the danger of a possible\r\nattack on the western littoral of Owari from the direction of Ise. He\r\nchose the latter course, and invaded Ise at the head of a\r\nconsiderable force. But he here met with a repulse at the hands of\r\nKusunoki Masatomo, who to the courage and loyalty of his immortal\r\nancestor, Masashige, added no small measure of strategical ability.\r\nHe succeeded in defending his castle of Yada against Nobunaga's\r\nattacks, and finally the Owari general, deceived by a rumour to the\r\neffect that Takeda Shingen had reached the neighbourhood of Gifu with\r\na strong army, retired hurriedly from Ise.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that three years later, in 1568, Hideyoshi\r\nsucceeded in inducing all the territorial nobles of northern Ise,\r\nexcept Kusunoki Masatomo, to place themselves peacefully under\r\nNobunaga's sway. Hideyoshi's history shows him to have been a\r\nconstant believer in the theory that a conquered foe generally\r\nremains an enemy, whereas a conciliated enemy often becomes a friend.\r\nActing on this conviction and aided by an extraordinary gift of\r\npersuasive eloquence, he often won great victories without any\r\nbloodshed. Thus he succeeded in convincing the Ise barons that\r\nNobunaga was not swayed by personal ambition, but that his ruling\r\ndesire was to put an end to the wars which had devastated Japan\r\ncontinuously for more than a century. It is right to record that the\r\nfailures made by Nobunaga himself in his Ise campaign were in the\r\nsequel of measures taken in opposition to Hideyoshi's advice, and\r\nindeed the annals show that this was true of nearly all the disasters\r\nthat overtook Nobunaga throughout his career, whereas his many and\r\nbrilliant successes were generally the outcome of Hideyoshi's\r\ncounsels.\r\n\r\nANOTHER SUMMONS FROM THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\nIn November, 1567, the Emperor again sent Tachiri Munetsugu to invite\r\nNobunaga's presence in Kyoto. His Majesty still refrained from the\r\ndangerous step of giving a written commission to Nobunaga, but he\r\ninstructed Munetsugu to carry to the Owari chieftain a suit of armour\r\nand a sword. Two years previously to this event, the tumult in Kyoto\r\nhad culminated in an attack on the palace of the shogun Yoshiteru,\r\nthe conflagration of the building, and the suicide of the shogun amid\r\nthe blazing ruins. Yoshiteru's younger brother, Yoshiaki, effected\r\nhis escape from the capital, and wandered about the country during\r\nthree years, supplicating one baron after another to take up his\r\ncause. This was in 1568, just nine months after the Emperor's second\r\nmessage to Nobunaga, and the latter, acting upon Hideyoshi's advice,\r\ndetermined to become Yoshiaki's champion, since by so doing he would\r\nrepresent not only the sovereign but also the shogun in the eyes of\r\nthe nation. Meanwhile--and this step also was undertaken under\r\nHideyoshi's advice--a friendly contract had been concluded with Asai\r\nNagamasa, the most powerful baron in Omi, and the agreement had been\r\ncemented by the marriage of Nobunaga's sister to Nagamasa.\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA PROCEEDS TO KYOTO\r\n\r\nIn October, 1568, Nobunaga set out for Kyoto at the head of an army\r\nsaid to have numbered thirty thousand. He did not encounter any\r\nserious resistance on the way, but the coming of his troops threw the\r\ncity into consternation, the general apprehension being that the\r\nadvent of these provincial warriors would preface a series of\r\ndepredations such as the people were only too well accustomed to. But\r\nNobunaga lost no time in issuing reassuring proclamations, which, in\r\nthe sequel, his officers proved themselves thoroughly capable of\r\nenforcing, and before the year closed peace and order were restored\r\nin the capital, Yoshiaki being nominated shogun and all the\r\nceremonies of Court life being restored. Subsequently, the forces of\r\nthe Miyoshi sept made armed attempts to recover the control of the\r\ncity, and the shogun asked Nobunaga to appoint one of his most\r\ntrusted generals and ablest administrators to maintain peace. It was\r\nfully expected that Nobunaga would respond to this appeal by\r\nnominating Shibata, Sakuma, or Niwa, who had served under his banners\r\nfrom the outset, and in whose eyes Hideyoshi was a mere upstart. But\r\nNobunaga selected Hideyoshi, and the result justified his choice, for\r\nduring Hideyoshi's sway Kyoto enjoyed such tranquillity as it had not\r\nknown for a century.\r\n\r\nNobunaga omitted nothing that could make for the dignity and comfort\r\nof the new shogun. He caused a palace to be erected for him on the\r\nsite of the former Nijo Castle, contributions being levied for the\r\npurpose on the five provinces of the Kinai as well as on six others;\r\nand Nobunaga himself personally supervised the work, which was\r\ncompleted in May, 1569. But it may fairly be doubted whether Nobunaga\r\nacted in all this matter with sincerity. At the outset his attitude\r\ntowards the shogun was so respectful and so considerate that Yoshiaki\r\nlearned to regard and speak of him as a father. But presently\r\nNobunaga presented a memorial, charging the shogun with faults which\r\nwere set forth in seventeen articles. In this impeachment, Yoshiaki\r\nwas accused of neglecting his duties at Court; of failing to\r\npropitiate the territorial nobles; of partiality in meting out\r\nrewards and punishments; of arbitrarily confiscating private\r\nproperty; of squandering money on needless enterprises; of listening\r\nto flatterers; of going abroad in the disguise of a private person,\r\nand so forth. It is claimed by some of Nobunaga's biographers that he\r\nwas perfectly honest in presenting this memorial, but others, whose\r\njudgment appears to be more perspicacious, consider that his chief\r\nobject was to discredit Yoshiaki and thus make room for his own\r\nsubsequent succession to the shogunate.\r\n\r\nAt all events Yoshiaki interpreted the memorial in that sense. He\r\nbecame openly hostile to Nobunaga, and ultimately took up arms.\r\nNobunaga made many attempts to conciliate him. He even sent Hideyoshi\r\nto solicit Yoshiaki's return to Kyoto from Kawachi whither the shogun\r\nhad fled. But Yoshiaki, declining to be placated, placed himself\r\nunder the protection of the Mori family, and thus from the year 1573,\r\nNobunaga became actual wielder of the shogun's authority. Ten years\r\nlater, Yoshiaki returned to the capital, took the tonsure and changed\r\nhis name to Shozan. At the suggestion of Hideyoshi a title and a\r\nyearly income of ten thousand koku were conferred on him. He died in\r\nOsaka and thus ended the Ashikaga shogunate.\r\n\r\nSAKAI\r\n\r\nOne of the incidents connected with Hideyoshi's administration in\r\nKyoto illustrates the customs of his time. Within eight miles of the\r\ncity of Osaka lies Sakai, a great manufacturing mart. This latter\r\ntown, though originally forming part of the Ashikaga domain,\r\nnevertheless assisted the Miyoshi in their attack upon the shogunate.\r\nNobunaga, much enraged at such action, proposed to sack the town, but\r\nHideyoshi asked to have the matter left in his hands. This request\r\nbeing granted, he sent messengers to Sakai, who informed the citizens\r\nthat Nobunaga contemplated the destruction of the town by fire.\r\nThereupon the citizens, preferring to die sword in hand rather than\r\nto be cremated, built forts and made preparations for resistance.\r\n\r\nThis was just what Hideyoshi designed. Disguising himself, he\r\nrepaired to Sakai and asked to be informed as to the object of these\r\nmilitary preparations. Learning the apprehensions of the people, he\r\nridiculed their fears; declared that Nobunaga had for prime object\r\nthe safety and peace of the realm, and that by giving ear to such\r\nwild rumours and assuming a defiant attitude, they had committed a\r\nfault not to be lightly condoned. Delegates were then sent from Sakai\r\nat Hideyoshi's suggestion to explain the facts to Nobunaga, who acted\r\nhis part in the drama by ordering the deputies to be thrown into\r\nprison and promising to execute them as well as their fellow\r\ntownsmen. In this strait the people of Sakai appealed to a celebrated\r\nBuddhist priest named Kennyo, and through his intercession Hideyoshi\r\nagreed to ransom the town for a payment of twenty thousand ryo. The\r\nfunds thus obtained were devoted to the repair of the palaces of the\r\nEmperor and the shogun, a measure which won for Nobunaga the applause\r\nof the whole of Kyoto.\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA'S SITUATION\r\n\r\nOda Nobunaga was now in fact shogun. So far as concerned legalized\r\npower he had no equal in the empire, but his military strength was by\r\nno means proportionate. In the north, in the east, in the west, and\r\nin the south, there were great territorial nobles who could put into\r\nthe field armies much larger than all the Owari chief's troops.\r\nTakeda Shingen, in the Kwanto, was the most formidable of these\r\nopponents. In the year 1570, when the events now to be related\r\noccurred, the Hojo sept was under the rule of Ujimasa, and with him\r\nShingen had concluded an alliance which rendered the latter secure\r\nagainst attack on the rear in the event of movement against Kyoto.\r\nThe better to ensure himself against Hojo designs, Shingen joined\r\nhands with the Satomi family in Awa, and the Satake family in\r\nHitachi; while to provide against irruptions by the Uesugi family he\r\nenlisted the co-operation of the priests in Kaga, Echizen, and Noto.\r\nShingen further established relations of friendship with Matsunaga\r\nHisahide in the far west. It was this baron that had attacked the\r\npalace of Nijo when Yoshiteru, the shogun, had to commit suicide, and\r\nShingen's object in approaching him was to sow seeds of discord\r\nbetween the shogunate and Nobunaga. Most imminent of all perils,\r\nhowever, was the menace of the Asai family in Omi, and the Asakura\r\nfamily in Echizen. A glance at the map shows that the Asai were in a\r\nposition to sever Nobunaga's communications with his base in Mino,\r\nand that the Asakura were in a position to cut off his communications\r\nwith Kyoto. In this perilous situation Nobunaga's sole resource lay\r\nin Tokugawa Ieyasu and in the latter's alliance with the Uesugi,\r\nwhich compact the Owari chief spared no pains to solidify. But from a\r\nmilitary point of view Ieyasu was incomparably weaker than Shingen.\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE WITH THE ASAKURA AND THE ASAI\r\n\r\nIn 1570, Nobunaga determined to put his fortunes to a final test.\r\nHaving concentrated a large body of troops in Kyoto, he declared war\r\nagainst Asakura Yoshikage, who had refused to recognize the new\r\nshogun. Success crowned the early efforts of the Owari forces in this\r\nwar, but the whole situation was changed by Asai Nagamasa, who\r\nsuddenly marched out of Omi and threatened to attack Nobunaga's rear.\r\nIt is true that before setting out for Kyoto originally, Nobunaga had\r\ngiven his sister in marriage to Nagamasa, and had thus invited the\r\nlatter's friendship. But Nagamasa had always been on terms of close\r\namity with Yoshikage, and, indeed, had stipulated from the outset\r\nthat Nobunaga should not make war against the latter. It cannot be\r\nsaid, therefore, that Nagamasa's move constituted a surprise.\r\nNobunaga should have been well prepared for such contingencies. He\r\nwas not prepared, however, and the result was that he found himself\r\nmenaced by Yoshikage's army in front and by Nagamasa's in rear.\r\nTokugawa Ieyasu, who had associated himself by invitation with this\r\nexpedition into Echizen, advised Nobunaga to countermarch with all\r\nrapidity for Kyoto, and it was so determined. Hideyoshi was left with\r\nthree thousand men to hold Yoshikage's forces in some degree of\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe situation at that moment was well-nigh desperate. There seemed to\r\nbe no hope for either Nobunaga or Hideyoshi. But Nobunaga was saved\r\nby the slowness of Nagamasa, who, had he moved with any rapidity,\r\nmust have reached Kyoto in advance of Nobunaga's forces; and\r\nHideyoshi was saved by an exercise of the wonderful resourcefulness\r\nwhich peril always awoke in this great man. Calculating that\r\nYoshikage's army would reach Kanagasaki Castle at nightfall,\r\nHideyoshi, by means of thousands of lanterns and banners gave to a\r\nfew scores of men a semblance of a numerous army. Yoshikage, who\r\nbelieved that Nobunaga had retired, was visited by doubts at the\r\naspect of this great array, and instead of advancing to attack at\r\nonce, he decided to await the morning. Meanwhile, Hideyoshi with his\r\nlittle band of troops, moved round Yoshikage's flank, and delivering\r\na fierce attack at midnight, completely defeated the Echizen forces.*\r\n\r\n*See A New Life of Toyolomi Hideyoshi, by W. Dening.\r\n\r\nThis episode was, of course, not conclusive. It merely showed that so\r\nlong as Nagamasa and Yoshikage worked in combination, Nobunaga's\r\nposition in Kyoto and his communications with his base in Mino must\r\nremain insecure. He himself would have directed his forces at once\r\nagainst Nagamasa, but Hideyoshi contended that the wiser plan would\r\nbe to endeavour to win over some of the minor barons whose\r\nstrongholds lay on the confines of Omi and Mino. This was gradually\r\naccomplished, and after an unsuccessful attempt upon the part of\r\nSasaki Shotei of Omi to capture a castle (Choko-ji) which was under\r\nthe command of Nobunaga's chief general, Katsuiye, the Owari forces\r\nwere put in motion against Nagamasa's principal strongholds, Otani\r\nand Yoko-yama. The former was attacked first, Nobunaga being assisted\r\nby a contingent of five thousand men under the command of Ieyasu.\r\nThree days of repeated assaults failed to reduce the castle, and\r\nduring that interval Nagamasa and Yoshikage were able to enter the\r\nfield at the head of a force which greatly outnumbered the Owari\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nIn midsummer, 1570, there was fought, on the banks of the Ane-gawa,\r\none of the great battles of Japanese history. It resulted in the\r\ncomplete discomfiture of the Echizen chieftains. The records say that\r\nthree thousand of their followers were killed and that among them\r\nwere ten general officers. The castle of Otani, however, remained in\r\nNagamasa's hands. Nobunaga now retired to his headquarters in Gifu to\r\nrest his forces.\r\n\r\nBut he was quickly summoned again to the field by a revolt on the\r\npart of the Buddhist priests in the province of Settsu, under the\r\nbanner of Miyoshi Yoshitsugu and Saito Tatsuoki. Nobunaga's attempt\r\nto quell this insurrection was unsuccessful, and immediately Nagamasa\r\nand Yoshikage seized the occasion to march upon Kyoto. The priests of\r\nHiei-zan received them with open arms, and they occupied on the\r\nmonastery's commanding site, a position well-nigh impregnable, from\r\nwhich they constantly menaced the capital. It was now the\r\ncommencement of winter. For the invading troops to hold their own\r\nupon Hiei-zan throughout the winter would have been even more\r\ndifficult than for Nobunaga's army to cut off their avenues of\r\nretreat and supply.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances peace presented itself to both sides as the\r\nmost feasible plan, and the forces of Nagamasa and Yoshikage were\r\nallowed to march away unmolested to Omi and Echizen, respectively.\r\nThis result was intensely mortifying to Hideyoshi, who had devoted\r\nhis whole energies to the destruction of these dangerous enemies. But\r\nthe final issue was only postponed. By contrivances, which need not\r\nbe related in detail, Nagamasa was again induced to take the field,\r\nand, in 1573, the Owari forces found themselves once more confronted\r\nby the allied armies of Echizen and Omi. By clever strategy the\r\nEchizen baron was induced to take the fatal step of separating\r\nhimself from his Omi colleague, and at Tone-yama he sustained a\r\ncrushing defeat, leaving two thousand of his men and twenty-three of\r\nhis captains dead upon the field. He himself fled and for a time\r\nremained concealed, but ultimately, being closely menaced with\r\ncapture, he committed suicide. Meanwhile, Nagamasa had withdrawn to\r\nhis stronghold of Otani, where he was besieged by Nobunaga. The\r\ncastle ultimately fell, Nagamasa and his son dying by their own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThis year witnessed also the death of Takeda Shingen, and thus\r\nNobunaga not only established his sway over the whole of the\r\nprovinces of Omi and Echizen but also was relieved from the constant\r\nmenace of a formidable attack by a captain to whom public opinion\r\njustly attributed the leading place among Japanese strategists. The\r\nwhole of Nagamasa's estates, yielding an annual return of 180,000\r\nkoku, was given to Hideyoshi, and he was ordered to assume the\r\ncommand of Otani Castle, whence, however, he moved shortly afterwards\r\nto Nagahama.\r\n\r\nHIEI-ZAN\r\n\r\nIt was now possible for Nobunaga to devote his entire attention to\r\nthe soldier-priests who had allied themselves with his enemies. It\r\nhas been shown that the monastery of Hiei-zan had afforded shelter\r\nand sustenance to the forces of Echizen and Omi during the winter of\r\n1570-1571, and it has been shown also that Nobunaga, underrating the\r\nstrength of the priests in the province of Settsu, sustained defeat\r\nat their hands. He now (1574) sent an army to hold the soldier-monks\r\nof Settsu in check while he himself dealt with Hiei-zan. This great\r\nmonastery, as already shown, was erected in the ninth century in\r\nobedience to the Buddhist superstition that the northeastern quarter\r\nof the heavens is the \"Demon's Gate,\" and that a temple must be\r\nerected there to afford security against evil influences. The temple\r\non Hiei-zan had received the munificent patronage of monarch after\r\nmonarch, and had grown to be a huge monastery, containing some three\r\nthousand priests. This miniature city completely commanded Kyoto, and\r\nwas guarded in front by a great lake. But, above all, it was\r\nsanctified by the superstition of the people, and when Nobunaga\r\ninvested it, he found the greatest reluctance on the part of his\r\ngenerals to proceed to extremities. Nevertheless, he overcame these\r\nscruples, and drawing a cordon of troops round the great monastery,\r\nhe applied the torch to the buildings, burnt to death nearly all its\r\ninmates, including women, confiscated its estates, and built, for\r\npurposes of future prevention, a castle at Sakamoto, which was placed\r\nunder the command of Akechi Mitsuhide. When, in after years, this\r\nsame Mitsuhide treacherously compassed Nobunaga's death, men said\r\nthat the opening of the Demon's Gate had entailed its due penalty.\r\n\r\nOTHER PRIESTLY DISTURBANCES\r\n\r\nIt was not in Settsu and at Hiei-zan only that the Buddhist soldiers\r\nturned their weapons against Nobunaga. The Asai sept received\r\nassistance from no less than ten temples in Omi; the Asakura family\r\nhad the ranks of its soldiers recruited from monasteries in Echizen\r\nand Kaga; the Saito clan received aid from the bonzes in Izumi and\r\nIga, and the priests of the great temple Hongwan-ji in Osaka were in\r\nfriendly communication with the Mori sept in the west, with the\r\nTakeda in Kai, and with the Hojo in Sagami. In fact, the difficulties\r\nencountered by Nobunaga in his attempts to bring the whole empire\r\nunder the affective sway of the Throne were incalculably accentuated\r\nby the hostility of the great Shin sect of Buddhism. He dealt\r\neffectually with all except the monastery at Ishi-yama in Osaka. The\r\nimmense natural strength of the position and the strategical ability\r\nof its lord-abbot, Kosa, enabled it to defy all the assaults of the\r\nOwari chief, and it was not until 1588--six years after Nobunaga's\r\ndeath--that, through the intervention of the Emperor, peace was\r\nfinally restored. After eleven years of almost incessant struggle,\r\nhis Majesty's envoy, Konoe Sakihisa, succeeded in inducing the Ikko\r\npriests to lay down their arms. It will be presently seen that the\r\ninveterate hostility shown by the Buddhists to Nobunaga was largely\r\nresponsible for his favourable attitude towards Christianity.\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF AZUCHI\r\n\r\nThe lightness and flimsiness of construction in Japanese houses has\r\nbeen noted already several times. Even though there was continual\r\nwarfare in the provinces of family against family, the character of\r\nthe fighting and of the weapons used was such that there was little\r\nneed for the building of elaborate defenses, and there was\r\npractically nothing worthy the name of a castle. Watch-towers had\r\nbeen built and roofs and walls were sometimes protected by putting\r\nnails in the building points outward,--a sort of chevaux de frise.\r\nBut a system of outlying defenses, ditch, earthen wall and wooden\r\npalisade, was all that was used so long as fighting was either\r\nhand-to-hand or with missiles no more penetrating than arrows. But\r\nwhen fire-arms were introduced in 1542, massively constructed castles\r\nbegan to be built. These were in general patterned after Western\r\nmodels, but with many minor modifications.\r\n\r\nThe first of these fortresses was built at Azuchi, in Omi, under the\r\nauspices of Oda Nobunaga. Commenced in 1576, the work was completed\r\nin 1579. In the centre of the castle rose a tower ninety feet high,\r\nstanding on a massive stone basement seventy-two feet in height, the\r\nwhole forming a structure absolutely without precedent in Japan. The\r\ntower was of wood, and had, therefore, no capacity for resisting\r\ncannon. But, as a matter of fact, artillery can scarcely be said to\r\nhave been used in Japan until modern days. Nobunaga's castle is\r\nstated by some historians to have been partially attributable to\r\nChristianity, but this theory seems to rest solely upon the fact that\r\nthe central tower was known as Tenshu-kaku, or the \"tower of the lord\r\nof Heaven.\" There were more numerous indications that the spirit of\r\nBuddhism influenced the architect, for in one of the highest storeys\r\nof the tower, the four \"guardian kings\" were placed, and in the lower\r\nchamber stood an effigy of Tamon (Ananda). The cost of constructing\r\nthis colossal edifice was very heavy, and funds had to be collected\r\nfrom the whole of the eleven provinces then under Nobunaga's sway.\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA AND IEYASU\r\n\r\nIt has already been noted that Ieyasu was Nobunaga's sole ally in the\r\neast of Japan at the time of the fall of the Imagawa clan. It has\r\nalso been noted that Ujizane, the son of Imagawa Yoshimoto, was a\r\nnegligible quantity. During many years, however, Ieyasu had to stand\r\nconstantly on the defensive against Takeda Shingen. But, in 1572,\r\nShingen and Ieyasu made a compact against the Imagawa, and this was\r\nfollowed by a successful campaign on the part of the Tokugawa leader\r\nagainst Ujizane. The agreement between Shingen and Ieyasu lasted only\r\na short time. In November, 1572, Shingen led a large force and seized\r\ntwo of the Tokugawa castles, menacing the third and most important at\r\nHamamatsu, where Ieyasu himself was in command. Nobunaga thereupon\r\ndespatched an army to succour his ally, and in January, 1573, a\r\nseries of bloody engagements took place outside Hamamatsu. One\r\nof Nobunaga's generals fled; another died in battle, and Ieyasu\r\nbarely escaped into the castle, which he saved by a desperate\r\ndevice--leaving the gates open and thus suggesting to the enemy that\r\nthey would be ambushed if they entered. This battle, known in history\r\nas the War of Mikata-ga-hara, was the greatest calamity that ever\r\nbefell Ieyasu, and that he would have suffered worse things at the\r\nhands of Takeda Shingen cannot be doubted, had not Shingen's death\r\ntaken place in May, 1573.\r\n\r\nVarious traditions have been handed down about the demise of this\r\ncelebrated captain, undoubtedly one of the greatest strategists Japan\r\never possessed. Some say that he was shot by a soldier of Ieyasu;\r\nothers that he was hit by a stray bullet, but the best authorities\r\nagree that he died of illness. His son, Katsuyori, inherited none of\r\nhis father's great qualities except his bravery. Immediately on\r\ncoming into power, he moved a large army against the castle of\r\nNagashino in the province of Mikawa, one of Ieyasu's strongholds.\r\nThis was in June, 1575, and on the news reaching Nobunaga, the latter\r\nlost no time in setting out to succour his ally. On the way a samurai\r\nnamed Torii Suneemon arrived from the garrison of Nagashino with news\r\nthat unless succour were speedily given the fortress could not hold\r\nout. This message reached Ieyasu, who was awaiting the arrival of\r\nNobunaga before marching to the relief of the beleagured fortress.\r\nIeyasu assured the messenger that help would come on the morrow, and\r\nurged Suneemon not to essay to re-enter the fortress. But the man\r\ndeclared that he must carry the tidings to his hard-set comrades. He\r\nwas taken prisoner by the enemy and led into the presence of\r\nKatsuyori, who assured him that his life would be spared if he\r\ninformed the inmates of the castle that no aid could be hoped for.\r\nSuneemon simulated consent. Despatched under escort to the\r\nneighbourhood of the fort, he was permitted to address the garrison,\r\nand in a loud voice he shouted to his comrades that within a short\r\ntime they might look for succour. He was immediately killed by his\r\nescort.\r\n\r\nThis dramatic episode became a household tradition in Japan. Side by\r\nside with it may be set the fact that Hideyoshi, who accompanied\r\nNobunaga in this campaign, employed successfully against the enemy\r\none of the devices recommended by the Chinese strategists, whose\r\nbooks on the method of conducting warfare were closely studied in\r\nthose days by the Japanese. Sakuma Nobumori, one of Nobunaga's\r\ncaptains, was openly, and of set purpose, insulted and beaten by\r\norders of his general, and thereafter he escaped to the camp of the\r\nTakeda army, pretending that the evil treatment he had undergone was\r\ntoo much for his loyalty. Katsuyori, the Takeda commander, received\r\nthe fugitive with open arms, and acting in accordance with his\r\nadvice, disposed his troops in such a manner as to forfeit all the\r\nadvantages of the position. The battle that ensued is memorable as\r\nthe first historical instance of the use of firearms on any\r\nconsiderable scale in a Japanese campaign. Nobunaga's men took\r\nshelter themselves behind palisades and fusilladed the enemy so hotly\r\nthat the old-fashioned hand-to-hand fighting became almost\r\nimpossible. The losses of the Takeda men were enormous, and it may be\r\nsaid that the tactics of the era underwent radical alteration from\r\nthat time, so that the fight at Takinosawa is memorable in Japanese\r\nhistory. Hideyoshi urged the advisability of pushing on at once to\r\nKatsuyori's capital, but Nobunaga hesitated to make such a call upon\r\nthe energies of his troops, and the final overthrow of the Takeda\r\nchief was postponed.\r\n\r\nMILITARY TACTICS\r\n\r\nThe Mongol invasion should have taught to the Japanese the great\r\nadvantages of co-operating military units, but individual prowess\r\ncontinued to be the guiding factor of field tactics in Japan down to\r\nthe second half of the sixteenth century, when the introduction of\r\nfirearms inspired new methods. Japanese historians have not much to\r\nsay upon this subject. Indeed Rai Sanyo, in the Nihon-gwaishi, may\r\nalmost be said to be the sole authority. He writes as follows: \"The\r\ngeneralship of Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin was something quite\r\nnew in the country at their time. Prior to their day the art of\r\nmanoeuvring troops had been little studied. Armies met, but each\r\nindividual that composed them relied on his personal prowess and\r\nstrength for victory. These two barons, however, made a special study\r\nof strategy and military tactics, with the result that they became\r\nauthorities on the various methods of handling troops. In reference\r\nto the employment of cavalry, the Genji warriors and the first of the\r\nAshikaga shoguns made use of horses largely, but in later days the\r\nAshikaga did not move away from Kyoto and had no use for horses.\r\nNobunaga, being near Kyoto, and most of the wars in which he engaged\r\ninvolving no very long marches, relied almost solely on infantry.\r\nBoth Takeda and Uesugi were well supplied with mounted troops, but\r\nowing to the hilly nature of their territories, they made no special\r\nstudy of cavalry exercises and, almost invariably, the soldiers\r\nemployed their horses solely for rapid movement from one place to\r\nanother; when a battle commenced they alighted and fought on foot. It\r\nis therefore correct to say that at this time cavalry had gone out of\r\nuse. Bows and arrows were, of course, superseded when firearms came\r\ninto use.\r\n\r\n\"Thenceforth, the gun and the long spear were the chief weapons\r\nrelied on. Peasants did not rank as soldiers, but their services were\r\nvariously utilized in time of war. They were trained in the use of\r\nmuskets, and of bows and arrows on hunting expeditions, and thus,\r\nwhen hostilities broke out, they were able to render considerable\r\nassistance in the defense of their houses. Highwaymen were frequently\r\nemployed as spies and scouts. Both Takeda and Uesugi sanctioned this\r\npractice. These two generals also agreed in approving the following\r\ntactical arrangement: the van-guard, consisting of musketeers,\r\nartillerymen, and archers, was followed by companies of infantry\r\narmed with long spears. Then came the cavalry, and after them the\r\nmain body, attached to which were drummers and conch-blowers. The\r\nwhole army was divided into right and left wings, and a body of men\r\nwas kept in reserve. At the opening of the battle, the horsemen\r\ndismounted and advanced on foot. This order was occasionally modified\r\nto suit altered circumstances, but as a rule, it was strictly\r\nfollowed.\"*\r\n\r\n*Quoted by W. Dening in A New Life of Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nThe artillery mentioned in the above quotation must be taken in a\r\nstrictly limited sense. Indeed, it would be more correct to speak of\r\nheavy muskets, for cannon, properly so called, may scarcely be said\r\nto have formed any part of the equipment of a Japanese army until\r\nmodern times. When the Portuguese discovered Japan, in 1542, they\r\nintroduced the musket to the Japanese, and the weapon was long known\r\nas Tanegashima, that being the name of the island where the\r\nPortuguese ship first touched. Thenceforth, the manufacture of\r\nfirearms was carried on with more or less success at various places,\r\nespecially Sakai in Izumi and Negoro in Kii. \"Small guns\" (kozutsu)\r\nand \"large guns\" (ozutsu) are mentioned in the annals of the time,\r\nbut by ozutsuwe must understand muskets of large calibre rather than\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nINVASION OF CHUGOKU.\r\n\r\nAt this time nearly the whole of central Japan (Chugoku) was under\r\nthe sway of Mori Terumoto, who succeeded his grandfather, Motonari,\r\nhead of the great Mori family and ancestor of the present Prince\r\nMori. One of these central provinces, namely, Harima, had just been\r\nthe scene of a revolt which Hideyoshi crushed by his wonted\r\ncombination of cajolery and conquest. The ease with which this feat\r\nwas accomplished and the expediency of maintaining the sequence of\r\nsuccesses induced Hideyoshi to propose that the subjugation of the\r\nwhole of central Japan should be entrusted to him and that he should\r\nbe allowed to adopt Nobunaga's second son, Hidekatsu, to whom the\r\nrule of Chugoku should be entrusted, Hideyoshi keeping for himself\r\nonly the outlying portions. Nobunaga readily agreed, and, in 1577,\r\nHideyoshi set out on this important expedition, with a force of some\r\nten thousand men, all fully equipped and highly trained. It is\r\nnoteworthy that, before leaving Azuchi, Hideyoshi declared to\r\nNobunaga his intention of conquering Kyushu after the reduction of\r\nChugoku, and thereafter he announced his purpose of crossing to Korea\r\nand making that country the basis of a campaign against China. \"When\r\nthat is effected,\" Hideyoshi is quoted as saying, \"the three\r\ncountries, China, Korea, and Japan, will be one. I shall do it all as\r\neasily as a man rolls up a piece of matting and carries it under his\r\narm.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these words that the project of invading Korea and\r\nChina was entertained by Hideyoshi nearly twenty years before--as\r\nwill presently be seen--he attempted to carry it into practice.\r\nHideyoshi marched in the first place to Harima, where his operations\r\nwere so vigorous and so successful that Ukita Naoiye, who held the\r\nneighbouring provinces of Bizen and Mimasaka under the suzerainty of\r\nMori Terumoto, espoused Nobunaga's cause without fighting. It is\r\nunnecessary to follow the details of the campaign that ensued. It\r\nlasted for five years, and ended in the subjection of as many\r\nprovinces, namely, Harima, Tamba, Tango, Tajima, and Inaba. Hideyoshi\r\nthen returned to Azuchi and presented to Nobunaga an immense quantity\r\nof spolia opima which are said to have exceeded five thousand in\r\nnumber and to have covered all the ground around the castle.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF THE TAKEDA\r\n\r\nShortly before Hideyoshi's triumphant return from his first brilliant\r\ncampaign in the central provinces, a memorable event occurred in Kai.\r\nNobunaga's eldest son, Nobutada, uniting his forces with those of\r\nIeyasu, completely destroyed the army of Takeda Katsuyori at\r\nTemmoku-zan, in the province of Kai. So thorough was the victory that\r\nKatsuyori and his son both committed suicide. Nobunaga then gave the\r\nprovince of Suruga to Ieyasu, and divided Shinano and Kotsuke into\r\nmanors, which were distributed among the Owari generals as rewards.\r\nTakigawa Kazumasu was nominated kwanryo of the Kwanto, chiefly in\r\norder to watch and restrain the movements of the Hojo family, now the\r\nonly formidable enemy of Nobunaga in the east.\r\n\r\nRESUMPTION OF THE CHUGOKU CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rest, Hideyoshi again left Kyoto for the central\r\nprovinces. He commenced operations on this second occasion by\r\ninvading the island of Awaji, and having reduced it, he passed on to\r\nBitchu, where he invested the important castle of Takamatsu, then\r\nunder the command of Shimizu Muneharu. This stronghold was so well\r\nplanned and had such great natural advantages that Hideyoshi\r\nabstained from any attempt to carry it by assault, and had recourse\r\nto the device of damming and banking a river so as to flood the\r\nfortress. About two miles and a half of embankment had to be made,\r\nand during the progress of the work, Mori Terumoto, who had been\r\nconducting a campaign elsewhere, found time to march a strong army to\r\nthe relief of Takamatsu. But Terumoto, acting on the advice of his\r\nbest generals, refrained from attacking Hideyoshi's army. He sought\r\nrather to invite an onset from Hideyoshi, so that, during the\r\nprogress of the combat, the garrison might find an opportunity to\r\ndestroy the embankment. Hideyoshi, however, was much too astute to be\r\ntempted by such tactics. He saw that the fate of the castle must be\r\nsealed in a few days, and he refrained from any offensive movement.\r\nBut, in order to gratify Nobunaga by simulating need of his\r\nassistance, a despatch was sent to Azuchi begging him to come and\r\npersonally direct the capture of the fort and the shattering of\r\nTerumoto's army.\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF NOBUNAGA\r\n\r\nAmong Nobunaga's vassal barons at that time was Akechi Mitsuhide. A\r\nscion of the illustrious family of Seiwa Genji, Mitsuhide had served\r\nunder several suzerains prior to 1566, when he repaired to Gifu and\r\noffered his sword to Nobunaga. Five years afterwards he received a\r\nfief of one hundred thousand koku and the title of Hyuga no Kami.\r\nThis rapid promotion made him Nobunaga's debtor, but a shocking\r\nevent, which occurred in 1577, seems to have inspired him with the\r\ndeepest resentment against his patron. Mitsuhide, besieging the\r\ncastle of Yakami in Tamba province, promised quarter to the brothers\r\nHatano, who commanded its defence, and gave his own mother as\r\nhostage. But Nobunaga, disregarding this promise, put the Hatano\r\nbrothers to the sword, and the latter's adherents avenged themselves\r\nby slaughtering Mitsuhide's mother. The best informed belief is that\r\nthis incident converted Mitsuhide into Nobunaga's bitter enemy, and\r\nthat the spirit of revenge was fostered by insults to which Nobunaga,\r\nalways passionate and rough, publicly subjected Mitsuhide. At all\r\nevents, when, as stated above, Hideyoshi's message of invitation\r\nreached Nobunaga at Azuchi, the latter gave orders for the despatch\r\nof a strong force to Takamatsu, one body, consisting of some thirty\r\nthousand men, being placed under the command of Mitsuhide. Nobunaga\r\nhimself repaired to Kyoto and took up his quarters at the temple\r\nHonno-ji, whence he intended to follow his armies to the central\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nMitsuhide concluded that his opportunity had now come. He determined\r\nto kill Nobunaga, and then to join hands with Mori Terumoto. He made\r\nknown his design to a few of his retainers, and these attempted\r\nfruitlessly to dissuade him, but, seeing that his resolution was\r\nirrevocable, they agreed to assist him. The troops were duly\r\nassembled and put in motion, but instead of taking the road westward,\r\nthey received an unexpected intimation, \"The enemy is in Honno-ji,\"\r\nand their route was altered accordingly. Nobunaga defended himself\r\nvaliantly. But being at last severely wounded and recognizing the\r\nhopelessness of resistance, he set fire to the temple and committed\r\nsuicide, his fourteen-year-old son, Katsunaga, perishing with him.\r\nHis eldest son, Nobutada, who had just returned from the campaign in\r\nthe east, followed his father to Kyoto, and was sojourning in the\r\ntemple Myogaku-ji when news reached him of Mitsuhide's treachery. He\r\nattempted to succour his father, but arrived too late. Then he\r\nrepaired to the Nijo palace and, having entrusted his infant son to\r\nthe care of Maeda Gen-i with instructions to carry him to Kiyosu, he\r\nmade preparation for defence against Mitsuhide. Finally, overwhelmed\r\nby numbers, he killed himself, and his example was followed by ninety\r\nof his retainers. Mitsuhide then proceeded to Azuchi and having\r\npillaged the castle, returned to Kyoto, where he was received in\r\naudience by the Emperor, and he then took the title of shogun.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE ASSASSINATION\r\n\r\nNobunaga was assassinated on the second day of the sixth month,\r\naccording to Japanese reckoning. News of the event reached the camp\r\nof the besiegers of Takamatsu almost immediately, but a messenger\r\nsent by Mitsuhide to convey the intelligence to Mori and to solicit\r\nhis alliance was intercepted by Hideyoshi's men. A great deal of\r\nhistorical confusion envelops immediately subsequent events, but the\r\nfacts seem simple enough. Hideyoshi found himself in a position of\r\ngreat difficulty. His presence in Kyoto was almost a necessity, yet\r\nhe could not withdraw from Takamatsu without sacrificing all the\r\nfruits of the campaign in the west and exposing himself to a probably\r\ndisastrous attack by Mori's army. In this emergency he acted with his\r\nusual talent. Summoning a famous priest, Ekei, of a temple in Aki,\r\nwho enjoyed the confidence of all parties, he despatched him to\r\nMori's camp with proposals for peace and for the delimitation of the\r\nfrontiers of Mori and Nobunaga, on condition that the castle of\r\nTakamatsu should be surrendered and the head of its commander,\r\nShimizu Muneharu, presented to his conquerer.\r\n\r\nMori was acting entirely by the advice of his two uncles, Kikkawa and\r\nKohayakawa, both men of profound insight. They fully admitted the\r\ndesirability of peace, since Hideyoshi's army effectually commanded\r\nthe communications between the eastern and western parts of Chugoku,\r\nbut they resolutely rejected the notion of sacrificing the life of\r\nShimizu on the altar of any compact. When the priest carried this\r\nanswer to Hideyoshi, the latter suggested, as the only recourse, that\r\nShimizu himself should be consulted. Ekei accordingly repaired to the\r\ncastle and explained the situation to its commandant. Shimizu had not\r\na moment's hesitation. He declared himself more than willing to die\r\nfor the sake of his liege-lord and his comrades, and he asked only\r\nthat fish and wine, to give the garrison the rare treat of a good\r\nmeal, should be furnished. On the 5th of the sixth month this\r\nagreement was carried into effect. Shimizu committed suicide, the\r\ncompact between Mori and Hideyoshi was signed, and the latter,\r\nstriking his camp, prepared to set out for Kyoto. It was then for the\r\nfirst time that Mori and his generals learned of the death of\r\nNobunaga. Immediately there was an outcry in favour of disregarding\r\nthe compact and falling upon the enemy in his retreat; but Kikkawa\r\nand Kohayakawa stubbornly opposed anything of the kind. They declared\r\nthat such a course would disgrace the house of Mori, whereas, by\r\nkeeping faith, the friendship of Hideyoshi and his fellow barons\r\nwould be secured. Accordingly the withdrawal was allowed to take\r\nplace unmolested.\r\n\r\nIEYASU\r\n\r\nThe life of the Tokugawa chieftain was placed in great jeopardy by\r\nthe Mitsuhide incident. After being brilliantly received by Nobunaga\r\nat Azuchi, Ieyasu, at his host's suggestion, had made a sightseeing\r\nexcursion to Kyoto, whence he prolonged his journey to Osaka and\r\nfinally to Sakai. The news of the catastrophe reached him at the\r\nlast-named place, and his immediate impulse was to be avenged upon\r\nthe assassin. But it was pointed out to him that his following was\r\nmuch too small for such an enterprise, and he therefore decided to\r\nset out for the east immediately. Mitsuhide, well aware of the\r\nTokugawa baron's unfriendliness, made strenuous efforts to waylay\r\nIeyasu on the way, and with great difficulty the journey eastward was\r\naccomplished by avoiding all the highroads.\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA\r\n\r\nNobunaga perished at the age of forty-nine. The great faults of his\r\ncharacter seem to have been want of discrimination in the treatment\r\nof his allies and his retainers, and want of patience in the conduct\r\nof affairs. In his eyes, a baron of high rank deserved no more\r\nconsideration than a humble retainer, and he often gave offence which\r\ndisturbed the achievement of his plans. As for his impetuousness, his\r\ncharacter has been well depicted side by side with that of Hideyoshi\r\nand Ieyasu in three couplets familiar to all Japanese. These couplets\r\nrepresent Nobunaga as saying:\r\n\r\n   Nakaneba korosu\r\n   Hototogisu.\r\n   (I'll kill the cuckoo\r\n   If if it won't sing)\r\n\r\nBy Hideyoshi the same idea is conveyed thus:--\r\n\r\n   Nakashite miyo\r\n   Hototogisu.\r\n   (I'll try to make the cuckoo sing.)\r\n\r\nWhereas, Ieyasu puts the matter thus:--\r\n\r\n   Nakumade mato\r\n   Hototogisu.\r\n   (I'll wait till the cuckoo does sing.)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever Nobunaga may have lost by these defects, the\r\nfact remains that in the three decades of his military career he\r\nbrought under his sway thirty-three provinces, or one-half of the\r\nwhole country, and at the time of his death he contemplated the\r\nfurther conquest of Shikoku, Chugoku, and Kyushu. To that end he had\r\nappointed Hideyoshi to be Chikuzen no Kami; Kawajiri Shigeyoshi to be\r\nHizen no Kami, while his own son, Nobutaka, with Niwa Nagahide for\r\nchief of staff, had been sent to subdue Shikoku. Even admitting that\r\nhis ambition was self-aggrandizement in the first place, it is\r\nundeniable that he made the peace of the realm, the welfare of the\r\npeople, and the stability of the throne his second purposes, and that\r\nhe pursued them with ardour. Thus, one of his earliest acts when he\r\nobtained the control in Kyoto was to appoint officials for\r\nimpartially administering justice, to reduce the citizens' taxes; to\r\nsuccour widows and orphans, and to extend to all the blessings of\r\nsecurity and tranquillity. In 1572, we find him sending messengers to\r\nthe provinces with instructions to put in hand the making of roads\r\nhaving a width of from twenty-one to twelve feet; to set up\r\nmilestones and plant trees along these roads; to build bridges; to\r\nremove barriers, and generally to facilitate communications.\r\n\r\nTowards the Throne he adopted a demeanour emphatically loyal. In this\r\nrespect, he followed the example of his father, Nobuhide, and\r\ndeparted radically from that of his predecessors, whether Fujiwara,\r\nTaira, or Ashikaga. As concrete examples may be cited the facts that\r\nhe restored the shrines of Ise, and reinstituted the custom of\r\nrenovating them every twenty years; that, in the year following his\r\nentry into the capital, he undertook extensive repairs of the palace;\r\nthat he granted considerable estates for the support of the Imperial\r\nhousehold, and that he organized a commission to repurchase all the\r\nproperties which had been alienated from the Court. Finally, it is on\r\nrecord that when, in recognition of all this, the sovereign proposed\r\nto confer on him the rank of minister of the Left, he declined the\r\nhonour, and suggested that titles of lower grade should be given to\r\nthose of his subordinates who had shown conspicuous merit.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MITSUHIDE\r\n\r\nIt was plainly in Hideyoshi's interests that he should figure\r\npublicly as the avenger of Nobunaga's murder, and to this end his\r\nspeedy arrival in Kyoto was essential. He therefore set out at once,\r\nafter the fall of Takamatsu, with only a small number of immediate\r\nfollowers. Mitsuhide attempted to destroy him on the way, and the\r\ndetails of this attempt have been magnified by tradition to\r\nincredible dimensions. All that can be said with certainty is that\r\nHideyoshi was, for a moment, in extreme danger but that he escaped\r\nscathless. Immediately on arriving in Kyoto, he issued an appeal to\r\nall Nobunaga's vassal-barons, inviting them to join in exterminating\r\nMitsuhide, whose heinous crime \"provoked both heaven and earth.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was no part of Hideyoshi's policy to await the arrival of\r\nthese barons. He had already at his command an army of some thirty\r\nthousand men, and with this he moved out, challenging Mitsuhide to\r\nfight on the plains of Yamazaki. Mitsuhide did not hesitate to put\r\nhis fortunes to the supreme test. He accepted Hideyoshi's challenge,\r\nand, on the 12th of June, a great battle was fought, the issue of\r\nwhich was decided by two things; first, the defection of Tsutsui\r\nJunkei, who refrained from striking until the superior strength of\r\nHideyoshi had been manifested, and secondly, the able strategy of\r\nHideyoshi, who anticipated Mitsuhide's attempt to occupy the position\r\nof Tenno-zan, which commanded the field. From the carnage that ensued\r\nMitsuhide himself escaped, but while passing through a wood he\r\nreceived from a bamboo spear in the hands of a peasant a thrust which\r\ndisabled him, and he presently committed suicide. Thus, on the\r\nthirteenth day after Nobunaga's death, the head of his assassin was\r\nexposed in Kyoto in front of the temple of Honno-ji where the murder\r\nhad taken place, and Mitsuhide's name went down in history as the\r\n\"Three days' shogun\" (Mikkakubo).\r\n\r\nCONFERENCE AT KIYOSU\r\n\r\nBy this time the principal of Nobunaga's vassal-barons were on their\r\nway at the head of contingents to attack Mitsuhide. On learning of\r\nthe assassin's death, these barons all directed their march to\r\nKiyosu, and in the castle from which Nobunaga had moved to his early\r\nconquests thirty years previously, a momentous council was held for\r\nthe purpose of determining his successor. The choice would have\r\nfallen naturally on Samboshi, eldest son of Nobunaga's first-born,\r\nNobutada, who, as already described, met his death in the Mitsuhide\r\naffair. But Hideyoshi was well understood to favour Samboshi's\r\nsuccession, and this sufficed to array in opposition several of the\r\nbarons habitually hostile to Hideyoshi. Thus, in spite of the fact\r\nthat both were illegitimate and had already been adopted into other\r\nfamilies, Nobunaga's two sons, Nobukatsu and Nobutaka, were put\r\nforward as proper candidates, the former supported by Ikeda Nobuteru\r\nand Gamo Katahide; the latter, by Shibata Katsuiye and Takigawa\r\nKazumasu.\r\n\r\nAt one moment it seemed as though this question would be solved by an\r\nappeal to violence, but ultimately, at the suggestion of Tsutsui\r\nJunkei, it was agreed that Samboshi should be nominated Nobunaga's\r\nsuccessor; that Nobukatsu and Nobutaka should be appointed his\r\nguardians, and that the administrative duties should be entrusted to\r\na council consisting of Shibata Katsuiye, Niwa Nagahide, Ikeda\r\nNobuteru, and Hideyoshi, each taking it in turn to discharge these\r\nfunctions and each residing for that purpose in Kyoto three months\r\nduring the year. An income of one hundred thousand koku in the\r\nprovince of Omi was assigned to Samboshi pending the attainment of\r\nhis majority, when he should be placed in possession of much larger\r\nestates, which were to be entrusted in the meanwhile to the keeping\r\nof one of the four barons mentioned above. Nobukatsu received the\r\nprovince of Owari, and Nobutaka that of Mino, the remainder of\r\nNobunaga's dominions being apportioned to his generals, with the\r\nexception of Hideyoshi, to whom were assigned the provinces recently\r\noverrun by him in the midlands--Tajima, Harima, Inaba, and Tamba.\r\n\r\nSuch an arrangement had no elements of stability. The four\r\ncouncillors could not possibly be expected to work in harmony, and it\r\nwas certain that Katsuiye, Sakuma Morimasa, and Takigawa Kazumasu\r\nwould lose no opportunity of quarrelling with Hideyoshi. Indeed, that\r\nresult was averted solely by Hideyoshi's tact and long suffering, for\r\nwhen, a few days later, the barons again met at Kiyosu for the\r\npurpose of discussing territorial questions, every possible effort\r\nwas made to find a pretext for killing him. But Hideyoshi's\r\nastuteness and patience led him successfully through this maze of\r\nintrigues and complications. He even went so far as to hand over his\r\ncastle of Nagahama to Katsuiye, and to endure insults which in\r\nordinary circumstances must have been resented with the sword.\r\nTradition describes a grand memorial ceremony organized in Kyoto by\r\nHideyoshi in honour of Nobunaga, and, on that occasion, incidents are\r\nsaid to have occurred which bear the impress of romance. It is, at\r\nall events, certain that the immediate issue of this dangerous time\r\nwas a large increase of Hideyoshi's authority, and his nomination by\r\nthe Court to the second grade of the fourth rank as well as to the\r\nposition of major-general. Moreover, the three barons who had been\r\nappointed with Hideyoshi to administer affairs in Kyoto in turn, saw\r\nthat Hideyoshi's power was too great to permit the peaceful working\r\nof such a programme. They therefore abandoned their functions, and\r\nHideyoshi remained in sole charge of the Imperial Court and of the\r\nadministration in the capital.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF SHIBATA KATSUIYE\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that Nobunaga's sons, Nobutaka and\r\nNobukatsu, were bitter enemies and that Nobutaka had the support of\r\nTakigawa Kazumasu as well as of Shibata Katsuiye. Thus, Hideyoshi was\r\nvirtually compelled to espouse the cause of Nobukatsu. In January,\r\n1583, he took the field at the head of seventy-five thousand men, and\r\nmarched into Ise to attack Kazumasu, whom he besieged in his castle\r\nat Kuwana. The castle fell, but Kazumasu managed to effect his\r\nescape, and in the mean while Katsuiye entered Omi in command of a\r\ngreat body of troops, said to number sixty-five thousand. At the last\r\nmoment, however, he had failed to secure the co-operation of Maeda\r\nToshiiye, an important ally, and his campaign therefore assumed a\r\ndefensive character. Hideyoshi himself, on reconnoitring the\r\nposition, concluded that he had neither numerical preponderance nor\r\nstrategical superiority sufficient to warrant immediate assumption of\r\nthe offensive along the whole front. He therefore distributed his\r\narmy on a line of thirteen redoubts, keeping a reserve of fifteen\r\nthousand men under his own direct command, his object being to hold\r\nthe enemy's forces in check while he attacked Gifu, which place he\r\nassaulted with such vigour that the garrison made urgent appeals to\r\nKatsuiye for succour.\r\n\r\nIn this situation it was imperative that some attempt should be made\r\nto break the line of redoubts, but it was equally imperative that\r\nthis attempt should not furnish to the enemy a point of\r\nconcentration. Accordingly, having ascertained that the weakest point\r\nin the line was at Shizugatake, where only fifteen hundred men were\r\nposted, Katsuiye instructed his principal general, Sakuma Morimasa,\r\nto lead the reserve force of fifteen thousand men against that\r\nposition, but instructed him at the same time to be content with any\r\nsuccess, however partial, and not to be betrayed into pushing an\r\nadvantage, since by so doing he would certainly furnish a fatal\r\nopportunity to the enemy. Morimasa neglected this caution. Having\r\nsuccessfully surprised the detachment at Shizugatake, and having\r\ninflicted heavy carnage on the defenders of the redoubt, who lost\r\nvirtually all their officers, he not only sat down to besiege the\r\nredoubt, whose decimated garrison held out bravely, but he also\r\nallowed his movements to be hampered by a small body of only two\r\nscore men under Niwa Nagahide, who took up a position in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, and displaying their leader's flag, deceived\r\nMorimasa into imagining that they had a powerful backing. These\r\nthings happened during the night of April 19, 1583. Katsuiye, on\r\nreceipt of the intelligence, sent repeated orders to Morimasa\r\nrequiring him to withdraw forthwith; but Morimasa, elated by his\r\npartial victory, neglected these orders.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the facts were communicated to Hideyoshi, at\r\nOgaki, distant about thirty miles from Shizugatake, who immediately\r\nappreciated the opportunity thus furnished. He set out at the head of\r\nhis reserves, and in less than twenty-four hours his men crossed\r\nswords with Morimasa's force. The result was the practical\r\nextermination of the latter, including three thousand men under\r\nKatsuiye's adopted son, Gonroku. The latter had been sent to insist\r\nstrenuously on Morimasa's retreat, but learning that Morimasa had\r\ndetermined to die fighting, Gonroku announced a similar intention on\r\nhis own part. This incident was characteristic of samurai canons.\r\nHideyoshi's victory cost the enemy five thousand men, and demoralized\r\nKatsuiye's army so completely that he subsequently found himself able\r\nto muster a total force of three thousand only. Nothing remained but\r\nflight, and in order to withdraw from the field, Katsuiye was obliged\r\nto allow his chief retainer, Menju Shosuke, to impersonate him, a\r\nfeat which, of course, cost Shosuke's life.\r\n\r\nKatsuiye's end is one of the most dramatic incidents in Japanese\r\nhistory. He decided to retire to his castle of Kitano-sho, and, on\r\nthe way thither, he visited his old friend, Maeda Toshiiye, at the\r\nlatter's castle of Fuchu, in Echizen. Thanking Toshiiye for all the\r\nassistance he had rendered, and urging him to cultivate friendship\r\nwith Hideyoshi, he obtained a remount from Toshiiye's stable, and,\r\nfollowed by about a hundred samurai, pushed on to Kitano-sho. Arrived\r\nthere, he sent away all who might be suspected of sympathizing with\r\nHideyoshi, and would also have sent away his wife and her three\r\ndaughters. This lady was a sister of Nobunaga. She had been given, as\r\nalready stated, to Asai Nagamasa, and to him she bore three children.\r\nBut after Nagamasa's destruction she was married to Katsuiye, and was\r\nliving at the latter's castle of Kitano-sho when the above incidents\r\noccurred. She declined to entertain the idea of leaving the castle,\r\ndeclaring that, as a samurai's daughter, she should have shared her\r\nfirst husband's fate, and that nothing would induce her to repeat\r\nthat error. Her three daughters were accordingly sent away, and she\r\nherself joined in the night-long feast which Katsuiye and his\r\nprincipal retainers held while Hideyoshi's forces were marching to\r\nthe attack. When the sun rose, the whole party, including the ladies,\r\ncommitted suicide, having first set fire to the castle.\r\n\r\nYODOGOMI\r\n\r\nOne of the three daughters of Asai Nagamasa afterwards became the\r\nconcubine of Hideyoshi and bore to him a son, Hideyori, who, by her\r\nadvice, subsequently acted in defiance of Ieyasu, thus involving the\r\nfall of the house of Hideyoshi and unconsciously avenging the fate of\r\nNobunaga.\r\n\r\nNOBUTAKA\r\n\r\nNobunaga's son, Nobutaka, who had been allied with Katsuiye, escaped,\r\nat first, to Owari on the latter's downfall, but ultimately followed\r\nKatsuiye's example by committing suicide. As for Samboshi, Nobunaga's\r\ngrandson and nominal heir, he attained his majority at this time, but\r\nproving to be a man of marked incompetence, the eminent position for\r\nwhich he had been destined was withheld. He took the name of Oda\r\nHidenobu, and with an income of three hundred thousand koku settled\r\ndown contentedly as Hideyoshi's vassal.\r\n\r\nOSAKA CASTLE\r\n\r\nHideyoshi left behind him a striking monument of his greatness of\r\nthought and power of execution. At Osaka where in 1532 the priests of\r\nthe Hongwan-ji temple had built a castle which Nobunaga captured in\r\n1580 only after a long and severe siege, Hideyoshi built what is\r\ncalled The Castle of Osaka. It is a colossal fortress, which is still\r\nused as military headquarters for garrison and arsenal, and the\r\ndimensions of which are still a wonder, though only a portion of the\r\nbuilding survives. Materials for the work were requisitioned from\r\nthirty provinces, their principal components being immense granite\r\nrocks, many of which measured fourteen feet in length and breadth,\r\nand some were forty feet long and ten feet wide. These huge stones\r\nhad to be carried by water from a distance of several miles. The\r\noutlying protection of this great castle consisted of triple moats\r\nand escarpments. The moats were twenty feet deep, with six to ten\r\nfeet of water. The total enclosed space was about one hundred acres,\r\nbut only one-eighth of this was the hominaru, or keep, inside the\r\nthird moat.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the plan of the castle was to have it divided\r\ninto spaces separately defensible, so that an enemy had to establish\r\nhis footing by a series of repeated efforts.\r\n\r\nAnd the second respect in which it was a novelty in Japanese\r\ndefensive warfare was that the castle donjon was heavily built and\r\narmoured after a fashion. The three-storey donjon was framed in huge\r\ntimbers, quite unlike the flimsy structure of most Japanese\r\nbuildings, and the timbers were protected against fire by a heavy\r\ncoat of plaster. Roof and gates were covered with a sort of\r\narmor-plate, for there was a copper covering to the roof and the\r\ngates were faced with iron sheets and studs. In earlier \"castles\"\r\nthere had been a thin covering of plaster which a musket ball could\r\neasily penetrate; and stone had been used only in building\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nTHE KOMAKI WAR\r\n\r\nAfter the suicide of his brother, Nobutaka, and when he saw that his\r\nnephew, Samboshi (Hidenobu), was relegated to the place of a vassal\r\nof Hideyoshi, Nobukatsu seems to have concluded that the time had\r\ncome to strike a final blow in assertion of the administrative\r\nsupremacy of the Oda family. He began, therefore, to plot with that\r\nobject. Hideyoshi, who was well served by spies, soon learned of\r\nthese plots, and thinking to persuade Nobukatsu of their\r\nhopelessness, he established close relations with the latter's three\r\nmost trusted retainers. No sooner did this come to the cognizance of\r\nNobukatsu than he caused these three retainers to be assassinated,\r\nand applied to Ieyasu for assistance, Ieyasu consented. This action\r\non the part of the Tokugawa baron has been much commented on and\r\nvariously interpreted by historians, but it has always to be\r\nremembered that Ieyasu had been Oda Nobunaga's ally; that the two had\r\nfought more than once side by side, and that had the Tokugawa leader\r\nrejected Nobukatsu's appeal, he would not only have suffered in\r\npublic estimation, but would also have virtually accepted a position\r\ninferior to that evidently claimed by Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nThe course of subsequent events seems to prove that Ieyasu, in taking\r\nthe field on this occasion, aimed simply at asserting his own\r\npotentiality and had no thought of plunging the empire into a new\r\ncivil war. In March, 1584, he set out from Hamamatsu and joined\r\nNobukatsu at Kiyosu, in Owari. The scheme of campaign was extensive.\r\nIeyasu placed himself in communication with Sasa Narimasa, in\r\nEchizen; with Chosokabe Motochika, in Shikoku, and with the military\r\nmonks in the province of Kii. The programme was that Narimasa should\r\nraise his standard in Echizen and Kaga, and that Motochika, with the\r\nmonks of Kii, should move to the attack of Osaka, so that Hideyoshi\r\nwould be compelled to carry on three wars at the same time. Hideyoshi\r\nmet this combination with his usual astuteness. He commissioned\r\nUesugi Kagekatsu to attack the Sasa troops in rear while Maeda\r\nToshiiye menaced them from the front; he told off Hachisuka to oppose\r\nthe soldier-monks of Kii; he posted Sengoku Hidehisa in Awaji to hold\r\nin check the forces of Chosokabe Motochika, and he stationed Ukita\r\nHideiye at Okayama to provide against the contingency of hostility on\r\nthe part of the Mori family. Fighting commenced in the province of\r\nIse, and success at the outset crowned the arms of Hideyoshi's\r\ngenerals. They captured two castles, and Ieyasu thereupon pushed his\r\nvan to an isolated hill called Komaki-yama, nearly equidistant from\r\nthe castles of Inu-yama and Kiyosu, in Owari, which he entrenched\r\nstrongly, and there awaited the onset of the Osaka army. The war thus\r\ncame to be known as that of Komaki.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi himself would have set out for the field on the 19th of\r\nMarch, but he was obliged to postpone his departure for some days,\r\nuntil Kuroda and Hachisuka had broken the offensive strength of the\r\nmonks of Kii. It thus fell out that he did not reach the province of\r\nOwari until the 27th of March. His army is said to have numbered one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand men. It is commonly alleged that this was\r\nthe only war between Ieyasu and Hideyoshi, and that the latter\r\nsuffered defeat at the hands of the former. But the fact is that two\r\nof Hideyoshi's generals, Ikeda Nobuteru and Mori Nagayoshi, acted in\r\ndirect contravention of his orders, and thus precipitated a\r\ncatastrophe for which Hideyoshi cannot justly be held responsible.\r\nThese two captains argued that as Ieyasu had massed a large force at\r\nKomaki and at the Obata entrenchments in the same district, he had\r\nprobably left his base in Mikawa comparatively undefended. They\r\nproposed, therefore, to lead a force against Mikawa. Hideyoshi showed\r\ngreat reluctance to sanction this movement, but he allowed himself to\r\nbe at last persuaded, with the explicit reservation that no success\r\nobtained in Mikawa province should be followed up, and that whatever\r\nthe achievement of Nobukatsu's troops, they should at once rejoin the\r\nmain army in Owari.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably Hideyoshi had in vivid recollection the disaster which\r\nhad overtaken Katsuiye at Shizugatake. Ieyasu, fully cognizant of the\r\nsituation through the medium of a spy, knew the limitations set by\r\nHideyoshi. On April the 7th, Nobuteru attacked the fortress of\r\nIwasaki, in Mikawa, killed its commandant, and captured the castle.\r\nBut elated by this victory, he neglected Hideyoshi's caution, and the\r\ngenerals of Ieyasu, closing in on him, inflicted a crushing defeat at\r\na place called Nagakude. It is thus evident that Hideyoshi's share in\r\nthe disaster was of a most indirect character. He immediately\r\nhastened to Nagakude, but only to find that Ieyasu had retired to\r\nObata, and subsequently, when Hideyoshi returned to his headquarters,\r\nIeyasu placed a still longer interval between the two armies by\r\nmarching back to Komaki.\r\n\r\nThe war thenceforth may be said to have consisted of a series of\r\nmenaces and evasions. Each general sought to entice his opponent out\r\nof an entrenched position, and each general showed an equal\r\ndetermination not to be so enticed. At last, Hideyoshi pushed a force\r\ninto Mino and captured several castles in that province. But even\r\nthis failed to change Ieyasu's attitude. The Tokugawa leader entered\r\nthe fortress of Kiyosu, and Nobukatsu repaired to that of Nagashima,\r\nin Ise. After eight months of this comparatively fruitless\r\nmanoeuvring, a treaty was concluded, on December the 11th, between\r\nHideyoshi and Nobukatsu, and subsequently between Hideyoshi and\r\nIeyasu, the latter giving his son Ogimaru to be adopted by Hideyoshi.\r\nThe boy was eleven years of age at the time. His name was changed to\r\nHashiba Hideyasu, and he received the appointment of governor of\r\nMikawa province.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in which this treaty was concluded have provoked\r\nmuch historical discussion. Did the overtures come originally from\r\nHideyoshi, or did they emanate from Ieyasu and Nobukatsu? Some\r\nannalists have endeavoured to prove that Hideyoshi assumed the\r\nattitude of a suppliant, while others have attributed that demeanour\r\nto the Tokugawa chieftain. The situation, however, presents one\r\nfeature which is very significant. It was not until the month of\r\nNovember, 1584, that Chosokabe Motochika effectually brought the\r\nisland of Shikoku under his sway, and thus became free to lead a\r\nstrong army, including the monks of Kii province, against Osaka. This\r\nformidable danger could not but influence Hideyoshi in the direction\r\nof clasping hands with his eastern foes, and it is therefore more\r\nthan probable that a statesman who had never previously allowed\r\nconsiderations of personal dignity to interfere with the prosecution\r\nof a vital policy, did not hesitate to bow his head to Nobukatsu, in\r\norder to recover the free use of the great army assembled in Owari,\r\nMino, and Ise. Most fortunate was it for Japan that events took this\r\nturn, for, had Ieyasu and Hideyoshi remained mutually hostile, the\r\ncountry would probably have been plunged into a repetition of the\r\nterrible struggle from which nothing enabled it to emerge except the\r\ncombined labours of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu. It was not,\r\nhowever, until the early summer of 1586 that Hideyoshi and Ieyasu\r\nestablished genuinely friendly relations. During a year and a half\r\nsubsequent to the conclusion of the treaty which ended the Komaki\r\nWar, Ieyasu held severely aloof and refrained from visiting Kyoto.\r\nFinally, Hideyoshi despatched Asano Nagamasa to propose that Ieyasu\r\nshould take into his household Hideyoshi's younger sister, and that\r\nHideyoshi should send his mother as a hostage to Okazaki, to remain\r\nthere during a visit by Ieyasu to Kyoto. Four months were needed by\r\nIeyasu to consider this proposal, and in September, 1586, he repaired\r\nto Osaka and thence accompanied Hideyoshi to Kyoto.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI BECOMES REGENT\r\n\r\nIn May, 1583, after the downfall of Katsuiye, the Emperor appointed\r\nHideyoshi to be a councillor of State, and conferred on him the\r\nfourth order of rank. In November of the following year, he received\r\nanother step of rank and was nominated gon-dainagon. The Emperor\r\nOkimachi at that time contemplated abdication, but the palace which\r\nhe would have occupied as ex-Emperor had fallen into such a state of\r\ndisrepair as to be virtually uninhabitable. Hideyoshi signalized his\r\nloyalty on this occasion by spending a large sum on the renovation of\r\nthe palace, and in recognition of his services the Emperor raised him\r\nto the high post of nai-daijin. It was confidently expected that he\r\nwould then become sa-daijin, but, owing to complications which need\r\nnot be related here, the outcome of the matter was that he received\r\nthe still higher post of kwampaku (regent). There can be no doubt\r\nthat he himself had contemplated becoming shogun. In fact, it is on\r\nrecord that he made proposals in that sense to Yoshiaki, the last of\r\nthe Ashikaga shoguns. But it had come by that time to be recognized\r\nthat only a scion of the Minamoto family could be eligible for the\r\npost of shogun, and thus Yoshiaki declined Hideyoshi's overtures,\r\nthough to accept them would have materially altered the fallen\r\nfortunes of the Ashikaga sept. Hideyoshi ultimately became prime\r\nminister of State (dajo daijiri) and took the family name of\r\nToyotomi. It is stated, but the evidence is not conclusive, that in\r\norder to reach these high posts, he had to be adopted into the house\r\nof a Fujiwara noble. He had been a Taira when he served under\r\nNobunaga, and to become a Fujiwara for courtly purposes was not\r\nlikely to cause him much compunction.\r\n\r\nTHE MONKS, SHIKOKU, AND ETCHU\r\n\r\nImmediately on the termination of the Komaki War, Hideyoshi took\r\nsteps to deal effectually with the three enemies by whom his\r\nmovements had been so much hampered, namely, the Buddhist priests of\r\nKii, the Chosokabe clan in Shikoku, and the Sasa in Etchu. It has\r\nalready been stated that the priests of Kii had their headquarters at\r\nNegoro, where there stood the great monastery of Dai-Dembo-In,\r\nbelonging to the Shingon sect and enjoying almost the repute of\r\nKoya-san. Scarcely less important was the monastery of Sawaga in the\r\nsame province. These two centres of religion had long been in\r\npossession of large bodies of trained soldiers whose ranks were from\r\ntime to time swelled by the accession of wandering samurai (ronin).\r\nThe army despatched from Osaka in the spring of 1585 to deal with\r\nthese warlike monks speedily captured the two monasteries, and, for\r\npurposes of intimidation, crucified a number of the leaders. For a\r\ntime, Koya-san itself was in danger, several of the fugitive monks\r\nhaving taken refuge there. But finally Koya-san was spared in\r\nconsideration of surrendering estates yielding twenty-one thousand\r\nkoku of rice, which properties had been violently seized by the\r\nmonasteries in former years.\r\n\r\nThree months later, Hideyoshi turned his arms against the Chosokabe\r\nsept in Shikoku. This being an enterprise of large dimensions, he\r\nentrusted its conduct to five of his most competent generals, namely,\r\nUkita Hideiye, Hachisuka Iemasa, Kuroda Nagamasa, Kikkawa Motoharu,\r\nand Kohayakawa Takakage. Hideyoshi himself would have assumed the\r\ndirect command, and had actually set out for that purpose from Osaka,\r\nwhen couriers met him with intelligence that less than one month's\r\nfighting had brought the whole of the Island of the Four Provinces\r\ninto subjection. He therefore turned eastward, and entering Etchu,\r\ndirected the operations, in progress there under the command of Maeda\r\nToshiiye against Sasa Narimasa. This campaign lasted seven days, and\r\nended in the surrender of Narimasa, to whom Hideyoshi showed\r\nremarkable clemency, inasmuch as he suffered him to remain in\r\npossession of considerable estates in Etchu.\r\n\r\nTHE UESUGI\r\n\r\nAt this time Hideyoshi cemented relations of friendship with the\r\nUesugi family of Echigo, whose potentialities had always been a\r\nsubject of apprehension to Nobunaga. The powerful sept was then ruled\r\nby Kagekatsu, nephew of the celebrated Kenshin. This daimyo had given\r\nevidence of good-will towards Hideyoshi during the Komaki War, but it\r\nwas naturally a matter of great importance to establish really\r\ncordial relations with so powerful a baron. History relates that, on\r\nthis occasion, Hideyoshi adopted a course which might well have\r\ninvolved him in serious peril. He entered Echigo with a mere handful\r\nof followers, and placed himself practically at the mercy of\r\nKagekatsu, judging justly that such trustful fearlessness would win\r\nthe heart of the gallant Kagekatsu. Hideyoshi's insight was justified\r\nby the sequel. Several of the principal retainers of Kagekatsu\r\nadvised that advantage should be taken of Hideyoshi's rashness, and\r\nthat his victorious career should be finally terminated in Echigo.\r\nBut this vindictive counsel was rejected by the Uesugi baron, and\r\nrelations of a warmly friendly character were established between the\r\ntwo great captains.\r\n\r\nINVASION OF KYUSHU\r\n\r\nThere now remained only three really formidable enemies of Hideyoshi.\r\nThese were Hojo Ujimasa, in the Kwanto; Date Masamime, in Dewa and\r\nMutsu, and Shimazu Yoshihisa, in Kyushu. Of these, the Shimazu sept\r\nwas probably the most powerful, and Hideyoshi determined that Kyushu\r\nshould be the scene of his next warlike enterprise. The Island of the\r\nNine Provinces was then under the rule of three great clans; the\r\nShimazu, in the south; the Otomo, in Bungo, and the Ryuzoji, in\r\nHizen. The most puissant of these had at one time been Ryuzoji\r\nTakanobu, but his cruel methods had alienated the sympathy of many of\r\nhis vassals, among them being Arima Yoshizumi, who threw off his\r\nallegiance to Takanobu and joined hands with Shimazu Yoshihisa.\r\nTakanobu sent an army against Yoshizumi, but the Satsuma baron\r\ndespatched Shimazu Masahisa to Yoshizumi's aid, and a sanguinary\r\nengagement at Shimabara in 1585 resulted in the rout of Takanobu's\r\nforces and his own death.\r\n\r\nTakanobu's son and successor, who was named Masaiye, being still a\r\nboy, advantage was taken of the fact by Otomo Yoshishige, who invaded\r\nHizen, so that Masaiye had to apply to the Shimazu family for\r\nsuccour. The Satsuma chieftain suggested that the matter might be\r\nsettled by mutual withdrawal of forces, but Yoshishige declined this\r\noverture, and the result was a battle in which the Otomo troops were\r\ncompletely defeated. Otomo Yoshishige then (1586) had recourse to\r\nHideyoshi for assistance, thus furnishing the opportunity of which\r\nOsaka was in search. Orders were immediately issued to Mori, Kikkawa,\r\nKohayakawa, and Chosokabe Motochika to assemble their forces for an\r\noversea expedition, and in the mean while, Sengoku Hidehisa was\r\ndespatched to Kyushu bearing a letter in which Hideyoshi, writing\r\nover his title of kwampaku, censured the Shimazu baron for having\r\nfailed to pay his respects to the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and called\r\nupon him to do so without delay. This mandate was treated with\r\ncontempt. Shimazu Yoshihisa threw the document on the ground,\r\ndeclaring that his family had ruled in Satsuma for fourteen\r\ngenerations; that only one man in Japan, namely Prince Konoe, had\r\ncompetence to issue such an injunction, and that the head of the\r\nhouse of Shimazu would never kneel to a monkey-faced upstart.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi had foreseen something of this kind, and had warned Sengoku\r\nHidehisa in the sense that whatever might be the action of the\r\nSatsuma baron, no warlike measures were to be precipitately\r\ncommenced. Hidehisa neglected this warning. Yielding to the anger of\r\nthe moment, he directed the Otomo troops to attack the Satsuma\r\nforces, and the result was disastrous. When the fighting ended, the\r\nSatsuma baron had pushed into Bungo and taken sixteen forts there, so\r\nthat fully one-half of Kyushu was now under the sway of the Shimazu.\r\nHideyoshi, on receiving news of these disasters, confiscated the\r\nestates of Sengoku Hidehisa, and issued orders to thirty-seven\r\nprovinces to provide commissariat for three hundred thousand men and\r\ntwenty thousand horses for a period of one year. Soon an army of one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men assembled at Osaka, and the van,\r\nnumbering sixty thousand, embarked there on the 7th of January, 1587,\r\nand landed at Yunoshima in Bungo on the 19th of the same month--dates\r\nwhich convey some idea of the very defective system of maritime\r\ntransport then existing. In Bungo, the invading army was swelled by\r\nthirty thousand men under the leadership of Kohayakawa and Kikkawa,\r\nand the whole force, under the command-in-chief of Hidenaga,\r\nHideyoshi's brother, moved to invest the castle of Takashiro.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow the fighting in all its details. The\r\nsalient facts are that Hideyoshi left Osaka with the main army of one\r\nhundred and thirty thousand men on the 22d of January, 1587, and,\r\ntravelling by land, reached the Strait of Akamagasaki--now called\r\nShimonoseki--on the 17th of February. He marched through Chikuzen,\r\nmaking friends of the local chieftains by forbearance and diplomacy,\r\nand fighting the first great battle of the campaign at Oguchi on the\r\nSendai-gawa. The Satsuma baron's younger brother, Iehisa, after a\r\ngallant resistance, surrendered to Hideyoshi, and was employed by the\r\nlatter to communicate direct with his chief, Yoshihisa. It was\r\ngenerally supposed that Iehisa would never return from this mission,\r\nbut would remain in the camp of Shimazu. He did return, however, his\r\nword of honour being of more importance in his estimation than the\r\nopportunity of recovering his liberty.\r\n\r\nHistory states that Hideyoshi thereafter treated this noble man with\r\nthe greatest consideration, but it is difficult to reconcile that\r\naccount with the fact that Hideyoshi subsequently pressed Iehisa to\r\nguide the Osaka army through the mountains and rivers which\r\nconstituted natural defences for the fief of Satsuma. Iehisa, of\r\ncourse, refused, and to Hideyoshi's credit it stands on record that\r\nhe did not press the matter with any violence. This difficulty of\r\ninvading an unknown country without any maps or any guides, a country\r\ncelebrated for its topographical perplexities, was ultimately\r\novercome by sending Buddhist priests to act as spies in the dominions\r\nof Shimazu. These spies were led by the abbot, Kennyo, with whose\r\nname the reader is already familiar, and as the Shimazu family were\r\nsincere believers in Buddhism, no obstacles were placed in the way of\r\nthe treacherous monks. They were able ultimately to guide the Osaka\r\narmy through the forests and mountains on the north of Kagoshima, and\r\nHideyoshi adopted the same strategy as that pursued in a similar case\r\nthree hundred years later, namely, sending a force of fifty thousand\r\nmen by sea with orders to advance against Kagoshima from the south.\r\nThe Satsuma troops were completely defeated, and only the castle of\r\nKagoshima remained in their hands.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the campaign Hideyoshi behaved with remarkable\r\nmagnanimity and foresight. Contrary to the advice of some of his\r\nprincipal retainers, he refused to proceed to extremities against the\r\nShimazu clan, and agreed to make peace, on the basis that the clan\r\nshould be left in possession of the provinces of Satsuma, Osumi, and\r\nHyuga, the only further stipulation being that the then head of the\r\nhouse, Yoshihisa, should abdicate in favour of his younger brother,\r\nYoshihiro. As for the Buddhist priests who had sacrificed their\r\nhonour to their interests, those that had acted as guides to the\r\ninvading army were subsequently crucified by order of the Satsuma\r\nbaron, and the Shin sect, to which they belonged, was interdicted\r\nthroughout the whole of the Shimazu fief. Yoshihiro was summoned to\r\nKyoto by Hideyoshi to answer for this action, but he pleaded that\r\nsuch treachery amply deserved such punishment, and that he was\r\nprepared to bow to Hideyoshi's judgment in the matter. The defence\r\nwas admitted by Hideyoshi, but the abbot Kennyo received such large\r\nrewards that he was able to erect the great temple Nishi Hongwan-ji,\r\n\"which became the wonder of after-generations of men and which has\r\noften been erroneously referred to by foreign writers as a proof of\r\nthe deep religious feelings of Buddhist converts three hundred years\r\nago.\"*\r\n\r\n*A New Life of Hideyoshi, by W. Dening.\r\n\r\nTHE HOJO\r\n\r\nFrom end to end of Japan there were now only two powerful barons\r\nwhose allegiance had not been formally rendered to Hideyoshi and to\r\nthe Emperor under the new regime. These were Date Masamune and Hojo\r\nUjimasa. The origin and eminence of the Hojo family from the days of\r\nits founder, Nagauji, have already been described in these pages, and\r\nit need only be added here that Ujimasa enjoyed a reputation second\r\nto none of his predecessors. That he should stand aloof from all his\r\nbrother barons seemed to the latter an intolerable evidence of pride,\r\nand they urged Hideyoshi to resort at once to extreme measures. There\r\ncan be no doubt that this was the intention of Hideyoshi himself, but\r\nwith characteristic prudence he had recourse at the outset to pacific\r\ndevices. He therefore sent an envoy to the Hojo's stronghold at\r\nOdawara, urging Ujimasa to lose no time in paying his respects to the\r\nCourt at Kyoto. The Hojo chief's reply was that Sanada Masayuki had\r\nencroached upon the Hojo estates in Numata, and that if this\r\nencroachment were rectified, the desired obeisance to the Throne\r\nwould be made.\r\n\r\nThereupon, Hideyoshi caused the restoration of Numata, but the Hojo\r\nbaron, instead of carrying out his part of the agreement, made this\r\nrestoration the pretext for an unwarrantable act of aggression.\r\nWhatever sympathy might have been felt in Kyoto with the Hojo family\r\nwas forfeited by this procedure, and in March, 1590, an army of over\r\ntwo hundred thousand men was set in motion for the Kwanto.\r\nHideyoshi's troops moved in three columns. One, commanded by Ieyasu,\r\nmarched by the seacoast road, the Tokaido; another, under Uesugi\r\nKagekatsu and Maeda Toshiiye, marched by the mountain road, the\r\nTosando, and the third attacked from the sea. None of these armies\r\nencountered any very serious resistance. The first approached Odawara\r\nby the Hakone range and the second by way of the Usui pass. The\r\ncastle at Odawara, however, was so strongly built and so stoutly held\r\nthat its capture by storm seemed impossible, and Hideyoshi's forces\r\nwere obliged to have recourse to a regular siege which lasted nearly\r\nfour months. During the latter part of that time, Hideyoshi\r\nencouraged his soldiers to indulge in all sorts of amusements, and\r\nthus the camp of the besiegers constantly echoed the notes of musical\r\nperformances and the shouts of dancers and sake drinkers. Finally, in\r\nJuly, 1590, the great fortress surrendered, and the Hojo baron,\r\nUjimasa, was put to death, his head being sent to Kyoto for exposure,\r\nbut the life of his son, Ujinao, was spared on condition that he\r\nenter a monastery.\r\n\r\nHOJO UJINORI\r\n\r\nOne incident of this struggle is very characteristic of the ethics of\r\nthe era. During the interchange of messages that preceded recourse to\r\narms, the Hojo baron sent his brother, Ujinori, to Kyoto as an envoy\r\nto discuss the situation with Hideyoshi. The latter received Ujinori\r\nwith all courtesy and endeavoured to impress upon him the imperative\r\nnecessity of his chief's acquiescence. Ujinori promised to contribute\r\nto that end as far as lay in his power, but history describes him as\r\nadding: \"Should my brother fail to comply with your commands, and\r\nshould it be necessary for you to send an army against the Kwanto, it\r\nmust be clearly understood that this visit of mine to your Excellency\r\nshall not in any way prejudice my loyalty to my brother. On the\r\ncontrary, if the peace be broken, I shall probably have to command\r\nthe van of my brother's forces, and in that event I may have to offer\r\nto your Excellency a flight of my rusty arrows.\"\r\n\r\nHideyoshi is narrated to have laughingly replied that the peace was\r\nin no danger of being broken and that he trusted Ujinori to use his\r\nbest endeavours to avert war. On his return to the Kwanto, Ujinori\r\nwas ordered to defend the castle of Nira-yama with seven thousand\r\nmen, and he soon found himself attacked by fifty thousand under seven\r\nof Hideyoshi's generals. Ujinori reminded his comrades that Nira-yama\r\nhad been the birthplace of the founder of the Hojo family, and\r\ntherefore it would be an eternal shame if even one of the\r\nentrenchments were lost. Not one was lost. Again and again assaults\r\nwere delivered, but they were unsuccessful, and throughout the whole\r\nof the Kwanto, Nira-yama alone remained flying the Hojo flag to the\r\nend. Ujinori surrendered in obedience to Ujimasa's instructions after\r\nthe fall of Odawara, but Hideyoshi, instead of punishing him for the\r\nheavy losses he had inflicted on the Osaka army, lauded his fidelity\r\nand bravery, and presented him with an estate of ten thousand koku.\r\n\r\nDATE MASAMUNE\r\n\r\nWhen news reached Date Masamune of the fall of all the Hojo's\r\noutlying forts and of the final investment of Odawara, he recognized,\r\nfrom his place in Mutsu and Dewa, that an attitude of aloofness could\r\nno longer be maintained with safety. Accordingly, braving\r\nconsiderable danger, he made his way with a small retinue to Odawara\r\nand signified his willingness to comply with any terms imposed by\r\nHideyoshi. Thus, for the first time since the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the whole of the empire was pacified.\r\n\r\nYEDO\r\n\r\nIt is historically related that, during the siege of Odawara,\r\nHideyoshi invited Ieyasu to the former's headquarters on Ishigaki\r\nHill, whence an uninterrupted view of the interior of the castle\r\ncould be had. The Tokugawa baron was then asked whether, if the eight\r\nprovinces of the Kwanto were handed over to him, he would choose\r\nOdawara for central stronghold. He replied in the affirmative.\r\nHideyoshi pointed out the superior advantages of Yedo from a\r\nstrategical and commercial point of view, and ultimately when he\r\nconferred the Kwanto on Ieyasu, he chose Yedo for the latter's\r\ncapital, the accompanying revenue being about two and a half million\r\nkoku. Hideyoshi further proposed to appoint Oda Nobukatsu to the\r\nlordship of the five provinces which had hitherto constituted the\r\ndomain of Ieyasu, namely, Suruga, Totomi, Mikawa, Kai, and Shinano.\r\nNobukatsu, however, alleging that he did not desire any large domain,\r\nasked to be allowed to retain his old estates in Owari and Ise.\r\n\r\nThis attitude angered Hideyoshi for reasons which will presently be\r\napparent. He assigned to Nobukatsu a comparatively insignificant fief\r\nat Akita, in the remote province of Dewa, and gave the estates in\r\nOwari and Ise to Hidetsugu, the nephew and adopted successor of\r\nHideyoshi, while the five provinces hitherto under the sway of Ieyasu\r\nwere divided among Hideyoshi's generals and retainers. In September,\r\n1590, Ieyasu entered Yedo, and subdivided his extensive domain among\r\nhis followers in order of merit, thus establishing the Tokugawa\r\nsystem of hereditary daimyo and founding a new Bakufu. All this was\r\nvery significant. In such matters, Hideyoshi had repeatedly shown\r\nhimself to be a man of great magnanimity, and had allowed even his\r\nenemies to retain possession of lands which would certainly have been\r\ntaken from them by other conquerors. Thus, in the case of the Mori\r\nsept, fully half of the midland counties was left in their\r\noccupation, and, in the case of the Shimazu family, they were\r\nsuffered to retain two and a half provinces.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Ieyasu, however, Hideyoshi behaved with marked\r\ncaution. By granting to the Tokugawa chieftain the whole of the\r\nKwanto, Hideyoshi made it appear as though he were conferring a\r\nsignal favour; but in reality his object was to remove Ieyasu out of\r\nthe zone of potential danger to Kyoto. Ieyasu fully recognized this\r\nmanoeuvre, but bowed to it as the less of two evils. As a further\r\nmeasure of precaution, Hideyoshi interposed one of his own family,\r\nHidetsugu, between the Kwanto and Kyoto, and with the object of\r\nmenacing the rear of Ieyasu and restraining the movements of the\r\nDate, he placed Gamo Ujisato at Aizu in Oshu. He further posted\r\nIshida Katsushige at Sawa-yama (now called Hikone) in the province of\r\nOmi, to cover the principal route to Kyoto, and for similar reasons\r\nwith regard to the Yamato and Tamba roads he assigned to his brother,\r\nHidenaga, the castle of Kori-yama, which commanded Izumi and Kii, and\r\nto his adopted son, Hidekatsu, the castle at Fukuchi-yama in Tamba.\r\nThis plan of distributing their domains, so that the daimyo should be\r\nmutually repressive, was followed with still greater care by Ieyasu\r\nwhen he, in turn, became supreme.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI AND BUDDHISM\r\n\r\nThere are evidences that, from his childhood, Hideyoshi had little\r\nreverence for the Buddhist faith. When only twelve years of age he is\r\nsaid to have beaten and smashed an image of Amida because it remained\r\nalways insensible to the offerings of food placed daily before it.\r\nAgain, when on his way to Kyoto to avenge the assassination of\r\nNobunaga, he saw an idol floating on a stream, and seizing the effigy\r\nhe cut it into two pieces, saying that the deity Daikoku, having\r\ncompetence to succour one thousand persons only, could be of little\r\nuse to him at such a crisis as he was now required to meet. Finally,\r\non the occasion of his expedition against the Hojo of Odawara, when\r\nthe sailors of Mishima, in Sagami, objected to carrying war-horses in\r\ntheir boats on the plea that the god of the sea, Ryujin, hated\r\neverything equine, Hideyoshi did not hesitate to remove these\r\nscruples by addressing a despatch to the deity with orders to watch\r\nover the safety of the steeds.\r\n\r\nYet this same Hideyoshi evidently recognized that the Buddhist faith\r\nhad great potentialities in Japan, and that its encouragement made\r\nfor the peace and progress of the country. Buddhism suffered terribly\r\nat the hands of Nobunaga. The great monastery of Enryaku-ji was a\r\nmass of blackened ruins at the time of the Oda baron's death, and it\r\nhas been shown that the monasteries of Kii and Osaka fared almost\r\nequally badly at the hands of Hideyoshi. Nevertheless the latter had\r\nno sooner grasped the supreme administrative power than he showed\r\nhimself a protector and promotor of Buddhism. Scattered throughout\r\nthe empire and apparently crippled for all time, the monks of\r\nHiei-zan very soon gave evidence of the vitality of their faith by\r\ncommencing a vigorous propaganda for the restoration of the great\r\nmonastery. Many renowned priests, as Zenso, Gosei, and others, headed\r\nthis movement; Prince Takatomo, adopted son of the Emperor Okimachi,\r\nagreed to become lord-abbot of the sect (Tendai), and the Imperial\r\nCourt issued a proclamation exhorting the people to subscribe for the\r\npious purpose. Hideyoshi, Ieyasu, and other great barons addressed\r\ntheir vassals in a similar sense, and in Hideyoshi's proclamation the\r\nimperative necessity of Enryaku-ji as a barrier at the \"Demon's Gate\"\r\nwas distinctly stated. Under such auspices the monastery quickly rose\r\nfrom its ashes, though in point of size and magnificence it was\r\ninferior to its predecessor. At the same time Hideyoshi steadily\r\npursued the policy of checking the military tendencies of the monks,\r\nand it may be said that, from his era, the soldier-priest ceased to\r\nbe a factor in the political situation.\r\n\r\nTHE KYOTO DAIBUTSU\r\n\r\nThe erection of a colossal image of the Buddha at Nara, in the eighth\r\ncentury, and at Kamakura, in the thirteenth century, marked the\r\nconsummation of great political programmes in which religious\r\ninfluence acted a strong part. Hideyoshi determined to set up a still\r\nmore imposing effigy in Kyoto, and, in 1586, the work was commenced\r\nunder the superintendence of Maeda Gen-i. All the principal\r\nidol-makers were summoned to the capital, and among them were said to\r\nhave been some Chinese experts. Hideyoshi declared that whereas the\r\nNara Daibutsu had taken twenty-seven years to build, the Kyoto image\r\nshould be finished in five. He kept his word. No less than twenty-one\r\nprovinces were placed under requisition for labour and materials. The\r\nenclosure of the temple containing the image measured 260 yards by\r\n274, and the great hall had dimensions of 110 yards by 74.\r\n\r\nThe original intention had been to make the idol of copper; but as\r\nthe statue was to have a height of 160 feet, the quantity of metal\r\nrequired could not have been obtained within the time fixed, and\r\nlacquered wood was therefore substituted for copper. It is related\r\nthat timbers of sufficient scantling could not be found anywhere\r\nexcept in the forests at the base of Fuji-yama, and Ieyasu employed\r\nfifty thousand labourers at a cost of a one thousand ryo in gold, for\r\nthe purpose of felling the trees and transporting them to Kyoto. The\r\noperations furnished evidence of the curiously arbitrary methods\r\npractised officially in that age. Thus, when the building was\r\ninterrupted owing to a lack of large stones for constructing the\r\npedestal, messengers were sent to appropriate rocks standing in\r\nprivate gardens, without consulting the convenience of the owners,\r\nand many beautiful parks were thus deprived of their most picturesque\r\nelements. Moreover, on the plea of obtaining iron to make nails,\r\nclamps, and so forth, a proclamation was issued calling upon the\r\ncivilian section of the population at large to throw their swords,\r\ntheir spears, their muskets, and their armour into the melting-pot.\r\nThis proclamation, though couched in terms of simulated benevolence,\r\namounted in reality to a peremptory order. The people were told that\r\nthey only wasted their substance and were impeded in the payment of\r\ntheir taxes by spending money upon weapons of war, whereas by giving\r\nthese for a religious purpose, they would invoke the blessings of\r\nheaven and promote their own prosperity. But, at the foot of these\r\nspecious arguments, there was placed a brief command that the weapons\r\nmust be surrendered and that those concerned should take due note of\r\ntheir duty in the matter. The import of such an injunction was not\r\nlost on the people, and general disarming of the agricultural and the\r\nartisan classes marked the success of Hideyoshi's policy. It is on\r\nrecord that he himself actually joined in the manual labour of\r\ndragging stones and timbers into position, and that, clad in hempen\r\ngarments, he led the labourers' chorus of \"Kiyari.\"\r\n\r\nTHE JURAKU-TEI\r\n\r\nIn the year 1586, the Emperor Okimachi resigned the throne to his\r\ngrandson, Go-Yozei. Like Nobunaga, Hideyoshi was essentially loyal to\r\nthe Imperial Court. He not only provided for the renovation of the\r\nshrines of Ise, but also built a palace for the retiring Emperor's\r\nuse. On the 11th of the seventh month of 1585, he was appointed\r\nregant (kwampaku), and on the 13th of the same month he proceeded to\r\nthe Court to render thanks. He himself, however, was without a\r\nresidence in the capital, and to remedy that deficiency he built a\r\npalace called Juraku-tei (Mansion of Pleasure) which, according to\r\nthe accounts transmitted by historians, was an edifice of exceptional\r\nmagnificence. Thus, the Taikoki (Annals of the Taiko) speak of \"gates\r\nguarded by iron pillars and copper doors; of high towers which shone\r\nlike stars in the sky; of roof-tiles which roared in the wind, and of\r\ngolden dragons which sang songs among the clouds.\" Nothing now\r\nremains of all this grandeur except some of the gates and other\r\ndecorative parts of the structure, which were given to the builders\r\nof the temples of Hongwan-ji after the destruction of the Juraku-tei\r\nwhen Hidetsugu and his whole family died under the sword as traitors.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that the edifice represented every\r\npossible feature of magnificence and refinement characteristic of the\r\nera.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi took up his abode there in 1587, and at the ensuing New\r\nYear's festival he prayed to be honoured by a visit from the Emperor.\r\nThis request was complied with during the month of May in the same\r\nyear. All the details of the ceremony were ordered in conformity with\r\nprecedents set in the times of the Ashikaga shoguns, Yoshimitsu and\r\nYoshimasa, but the greatly superior resources of Hideyoshi were\r\nenlisted to give eclat to the fete. The ceremonies were spread over\r\nfive days. They included singing, dancing, couplet composing, and\r\npresent giving. The last was on a scale of unprecedented dimensions.\r\nThe presents to the Imperial household and to the Court Nobles Varied\r\nfrom three hundred koku of rice to 5530 ryo of silver, and in the\r\ncase of the Court ladies, the lowest was fifty koku and the highest\r\nthree hundred.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was utilized by Hideyoshi for an important ceremony,\r\nwhich amounted to a public recognition of his own supremacy. A\r\nwritten oath was signed and sealed by six great barons, of whom the\r\nfirst four represented the Toyotomi (Hideyoshi's) family and the last\r\ntwo were Ieyasu and Nobukatsu. The signatories of this oath solemnly\r\nbound themselves to respect eternally the estates and possessions of\r\nthe members of the Imperial house, of the Court nobles, and of the\r\nImperial princes, and further to obey faithfully all commands issued\r\nby the regent. This obligation was guaranteed by invoking the curse\r\nof all the guardian deities of the empire on the head of anyone\r\nviolating the engagement. A similar solemn pledge in writing was\r\nsigned by twenty-two of the great military barons.\r\n\r\nTHE KITANO FETE\r\n\r\nThe esoterics of the tea ceremonial and the vogue it obtained in the\r\ndays of the shogun Yoshimasa, have already been described. But note\r\nmust be taken here of the extraordinary zeal displayed by Hideyoshi\r\nin this matter. Some claim that his motive was mainly political;\r\nothers that he was influenced by purely esthetic sentiments, and\r\nothers, again, that both feelings were responsible in an equal\r\ndegree. There is no material for an exact analysis. He doubtless\r\nappreciated the point of view of the historian who wrote that\r\n\"between flogging a war-steed along the way to death and discussing\r\nesthetic canons over a cup of tea in a little chamber nine feet\r\nsquare, there was a radical difference.\" But it must also have\r\nappealed keenly to his fancy that he, a veritable upstart, by birth a\r\nplebeian and by habit a soldier, should ultimately set the lead in\r\nartistic fashions to the greatest aristocrats in the empire in a cult\r\nessentially pacific.\r\n\r\nHowever these things may have been, the fact remains that on the 1st\r\nof November, 1587, there was organized by his orders on the Pine\r\nPlain (Matsubara) of Kitano a cha-no-yu fete of unprecedented\r\nmagnitude. The date of the fete was placarded in Kyoto, Nara, Osaka,\r\nSakai, and other towns of importance more than a month in advance;\r\nall lovers of the tea cult were invited, whether plebeian or\r\npatrician, whether rich or poor; frugality was enjoined, and the\r\nproclamations promised that the choicest among the objects of art\r\ncollected by Hideyoshi during many decades should be exhibited. It is\r\nrecorded that over 360 persons attended the fete. Some erected simple\r\nedifices under the pine trees; some set up a monster umbrella for a\r\nroof, and some brought portable pavilions. These various edifices are\r\nsaid to have occupied a space of six square miles. Three pavilions\r\nwere devoted to Hideyoshi's art-objects, and he himself served tea\r\nand exhibited his esthetic treasures to Ieyasu, Nobukatsu, Toshiiye,\r\nand other distinguished personages.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI'S LARGESSE\r\n\r\nHideyoshi's love of ostentation when political ends could be served\r\nthereby was strikingly illustrated by a colossal distribution of gold\r\nand silver. One morning in June, 1589, the space within the main gate\r\nof the Juraku palace was seen to be occupied throughout a length of\r\nnearly three hundred yards with gold and silver coins heaped up on\r\ntrays each containing one hundred and fifty pieces. Immediately\r\nwithin the gate sat Hideyoshi, and beside him was the Emperor's\r\nyounger brother, Prince Roku. The mass of glittering treasure was\r\nguarded by officials under the superintendence of Maeda Gen-i, and\r\npresently the names of the personages who were to be recipients of\r\nHideyoshi's largesse were read aloud, whereupon each of those\r\nindicated advanced and received a varying number of the precious\r\ntrays. The members of Hideyoshi's family were specially favoured in\r\nthis distribution. His mother received 3000 ryo of gold and 10,000\r\nryo of silver; his brother, Hidenaga, 3000 ryo of gold and 20,000 of\r\nsilver; and his nephew, Hidetsugu, 3000 of gold and 10,000 of silver.\r\nTo Nobukatsu, to Ieyasu, to Mori Terumoto, to Uesugi Kagekatsu, and\r\nto Maeda Toshiiye, great sums were given, varying from 3000 ryo of\r\ngold and 10,000 of silver to 1000 of gold and 10,000 of silver. It is\r\nsaid that the total of the coins thus bestowed amounted to 365,000\r\nryo, a vast sum in that era. A history of the time observes that the\r\nchief recipients of Hideyoshi's generosity were the members of his\r\nown family, and that he would have shown better taste had he made\r\nthese donations privately. Perhaps the deepest impression produced by\r\nthis grand display was a sense of the vast treasure amassed by\r\nHideyoshi; and possibly he contemplated something of the kind.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SNOW IMAGE OF DHARMA\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: A FENCING OUTFIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE INVASION OF KOREA\r\n\r\nCAUSES\r\n\r\nHAVING brought the whole of Japan under his control, Hideyoshi\r\nconceived the project of conquering China. That appears to be the\r\nsimplest explanation of his action. His motive, however, has been\r\nvariously interpreted. Some historians maintain that his prime\r\npurpose was to find occupation for the vast host of soldiers who had\r\nbeen called into existence in Japan by four centuries of almost\r\ncontinuous warfare. Others do not hesitate to allege that this\r\noversea campaign was designed for the purpose of assisting to\r\nexterminate the Christian converts. Others, again, attempt to prove\r\nthat personal ambition was Hideyoshi's sole incentive. It does not\r\nseem necessary to estimate the relative truth of these analyses,\r\nespecially as the evidence adduced by their several supporters is\r\nmore or less conjectural. As to the idea that Hideyoshi was\r\ninfluenced by anti-Christian sentiment, it is sufficient to observe\r\nthat out of nearly a quarter of a million of Japanese soldiers who\r\nlanded in Korea during the course of the campaign, not so much as ten\r\nper cent, were Christians, and with regard to the question of\r\npersonal ambition, it may be conceded at once that if Hideyoshi's\r\ncharacter lays him open to such a charge, his well-proven statecraft\r\nexonerates him from any suspicion of having acted without thought for\r\nhis country's good.\r\n\r\nOne fact which does not seem to have been sufficiently considered by\r\nannalists is that during the sixteenth century the taste for foreign\r\nadventure had grown largely in Japan. Many persons had gone abroad in\r\nquest of fortune and had found it. It is on record that emigrants\r\nfrom the province of Hizen had established themselves in considerable\r\nnumbers in China, and that their success induced their feudal lord,\r\nNabeshima, to seek the Central Government's permission for returning\r\nhis province to the latter and taking, in lieu, the district near\r\nNingpo, where his vassals had settled. Hideyoshi doubtless shared the\r\ngeneral belief that in oversea countries Japanese enterprise could\r\nfind many profitable opportunities, and it is easy to believe that\r\nthe weakened condition of China towards the close of the Ming dynasty\r\nled him to form a not very flattering estimate of that country's\r\npower of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Korea had not in itself any special temptation. He\r\nregarded the peninsula simply as a basis for an attack upon China,\r\nand he made it quite clear to the Korean sovereign that, if the\r\nlatter suffered his territories to be converted into a stepping-stone\r\nfor that purpose, friendship with Japan might be confidently\r\nanticipated. Korea, at that time, was under the sway of a single\r\nruler, whose dynasty enjoyed the protection of the Chinese Court, and\r\nbetween the two sovereigns embassies were regularly exchanged. It has\r\nalready been stated in these pages that towards the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century Japanese settlers in Korea had been assigned three\r\nplaces of residence, but owing to the exactions suffered at the hands\r\nof the local authorities, these settlers had risen in revolt and had\r\nfinally been expelled from Korea until the year 1572, when a\r\nconcession was once more set apart for Japanese use at Fusan. No\r\nlonger, however, were envoys sent from Korea to Japan, and evidence\r\nof the outrages committed from time to time by Japanese pirates is\r\nfurnished by a decree of the Korean Government that a Japanese\r\nsubject landing anywhere except at Fusan would be treated as a\r\ncorsair.\r\n\r\nSuch were the existing conditions when, in 1587, Hideyoshi called\r\nupon the Korean monarch to explain the cessation of the old-time\r\ncustom of exchanging envoys. To this the King of Korea replied that\r\nhe would willingly renew the ancient relations provided that the\r\nJapanese authorities seized and handed over a number of Korean\r\nrenegades, who had been acting as guides to Japanese pirates in\r\ndescents on the Korean coast. This stipulation having been complied\r\nwith, a Korean embassy was duly despatched by Kyoto, and after some\r\ndelay its members were received by Hideyoshi in the hall of audience.\r\nWhat happened on this occasion is described in Korean annals,\r\ntranslated as follows by Mr. Aston*:\r\n\r\n*Hideyoshi's Invasion of Korea, by Aston. \"Transactions of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Japan,\" Vol. VI.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors were allowed to enter the palace gate borne in their\r\npalanquins. They were preceded the whole way by a band of music. They\r\nascended into the hall, where they performed their obeisances.\r\nHideyoshi is a mean and ignoble-looking man; his complexion is dark,\r\nand his features are wanting in distinction. But his eyeballs send\r\nout fire in flashes--enough to pierce one through. He sat upon a\r\nthreefold cushion with his face to the south. He wore a gauze hat and\r\na dark-coloured robe of State. His officers were ranged round him,\r\neach in his proper place. When the ambassadors were introduced and\r\nhad taken their seats, the refreshments offered them were of the most\r\nfrugal description. A tray was set before each, on which was one dish\r\ncontaining steamed mochi (rice-cake), and sake of an inferior quality\r\nwas handed round a few times in earthenware cups and in a very\r\nunceremonious way. The civility of drinking to one another was not\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval, Hideyoshi retired behind a curtain, but all\r\nhis officers remained in their places. Soon after, a man came out\r\ndressed in ordinary clothes, with a baby in his arms, and strolled\r\nabout the hall. This was no other than Hideyoshi himself, and\r\neveryone present bowed down his head to the ground. Looking out\r\nbetween the pillars of the hall, Hideyoshi espied the Korean\r\nmusicians. He commanded them to strike up all together as loud as\r\nthey could, and was listening to their music when he was reminded\r\nthat babies could despise ceremonies as much as princes, and\r\nlaughingly called one of his attendants to take the child and bring\r\nhim a change of clothing. He seemed to do exactly as he pleased, and\r\nwas as unconcerned as if nobody else were present. The ambassadors,\r\nhaving made their obeisance, retired, and this audience was the only\r\noccasion on which they were admitted to Hideyoshi's presence.\r\n\r\nAfter long delay Hideyoshi replied to the letter carried by the above\r\nenvoys, and his language is important as clearly indicating the part\r\nwhich he designed for Korea in the pending war. The document is thus\r\ntranslated by Mr. Aston:\r\n\r\nThis empire has of late years been brought to ruin by internal\r\ndissensions which allowed no opportunity for laying aside armour.\r\nThis state of things roused me to indignation, and in a few years I\r\nrestored peace to the country. I am the only remaining scion of a\r\nhumble stock, but my mother once had a dream in which she saw the sun\r\nenter her bosom, after which she gave birth to me. There was then a\r\nsoothsayer who said: \"Wherever the sun shines, there will be no place\r\nwhich shall not be subject to him. It may not be doubted that one day\r\nhis power will overspread the empire.\" It has therefore been my boast\r\nto lose no favourable opportunity, and taking wings like a dragon, I\r\nhave subdued the east, chastised the west, punished the south, and\r\nsmitten the north. Speedy and great success has attended my career,\r\nwhich has been like the rising sun illuminating the whole earth.\r\n\r\nWhen I reflect that the life of man is less than one hundred years,\r\nwhy should I spend my days in sorrow for one thing only? I will\r\nassemble a mighty host, and, invading the country of the great Ming,\r\nI will fill with the hoar-frost from my sword the whole sky over the\r\nfour hundred provinces. Should I carry out this purpose, I hope that\r\nKorea will be my vanguard. Let her not fail to do so, for my\r\nfriendship with your honourable country depends solely on your\r\nconduct when I lead my army against China.\r\n\r\nThe Korean envoys entrusted with the delivery of the above despatch\r\nwere accompanied by one of the chief vassals of the Tsushima baron,\r\nand a monk, named Genso, who acted in the capacity of interpreter. By\r\nthese two Japanese the Korean Government was clearly informed that\r\nnothing was required of Korea beyond throwing open the roads to\r\nChina, and that she would not be asked to give any other assistance\r\nwhatever in the war against her northern neighbour. In the context of\r\nthis explanation, the Seoul Government was reminded that, three\r\ncenturies previously, Korea had permitted her territory to be made a\r\nbasis of Mongolian operations against Japan, and therefore the\r\npeninsula might well allow itself to be now used as a basis of\r\nJapanese operations against China. From Korean annals we learn that\r\nthe following despatch was ultimately sent by the Korean sovereign to\r\nHideyoshi*:\r\n\r\n*Hulbert's History of Korea.\r\n\r\nTwo letters have already passed between us, and the matter has been\r\nsufficiently discussed. What talk is this of our joining you against\r\nChina? From the earliest times we have followed law and right. From\r\nwithin and from without all lands are subject to China. If you have\r\ndesired to send your envoys to China, how much more should we? When\r\nwe have been unfortunate she has helped us. The relations which\r\nsubsist between us are those of parent and child. This you know well.\r\nCan we desert both Emperor and parent and join with you? You\r\ndoubtless will be angry at this, and it is because you have not been\r\nadmitted to the Court of China. Why is it that you are not willing to\r\nadmit the suzerainty of the Emperor, instead of harbouring such\r\nhostile intents against him? This truly passes our comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of this language was intensified by a comment made to\r\nthe Japanese envoys when handing them the above despatch. His Majesty\r\nsaid that Japan's programme of conquering China resembled an attempt\r\nto bail out the ocean with a cockle-shell. From Korea's point of view\r\nher attitude was perfectly justifiable. The dynasty by which the\r\npeninsula was then ruled owed its very existence to China's aid, and\r\nduring two centuries the peninsula had enjoyed peace and a certain\r\nmeasure of prosperity under that dynasty. On the other hand, Korea\r\nwas not in a position to think of resisting Japan on the\r\nbattle-field. The only army which the former could boast of\r\npossessing consisted of men who were too indigent to purchase\r\nexemption from service with the colours, and thus she may be said to\r\nhave been practically without any efficient military organization.\r\nMoreover, her troops were not equipped with either artillery or\r\nmatch-locks. The only advantage which she possessed may be said to\r\nhave been exceedingly difficult topographical features, which were\r\npractically unknown to the Japanese. Japan had not at that time even\r\nthe elements of the organization which she was ultimately destined to\r\ncarry to such a high point of perfection. She had no secret-service\r\nagents or any cartographers to furnish her generals with information\r\nessential to the success of an invasion, and from the moment that her\r\ntroops landed in Korea, their environment would be absolutely\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nJAPAN'S PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\nThese considerations did not, however, deter Hideyoshi. Immediately\r\non receipt of the above despatch from the Korean Court, preparations\r\nwere commenced for an oversea expedition on a colossal scale. Nagoya,\r\nin the province of Hizen, was chosen for the home-basis of\r\noperations. It has been observed by several critics that if\r\nHideyoshi, instead of moving by Korea, had struck at China direct\r\noversea, he would in all probability have seen his flag waving over\r\nPeking in a few months, and the whole history of the Orient would\r\nhave been altered. That may possibly be true. But we have to remember\r\nthat the Korean peninsula lies almost within sight of the shores of\r\nJapan, whereas to reach China direct by water involves a voyage of\r\nseveral hundred miles over seas proverbially tempestuous and\r\ndangerous. Even in modern times, when maritime transport has been so\r\ngreatly developed, a general might well hesitate between the choice\r\nof the Korean and the ocean routes to China from Japan, were he\r\nrequired to make a choice. In the face of the certainty of Korean\r\nhostility, however, Hideyoshi's selection was certainly open to\r\ncriticism. Nevertheless, the event showed that he did not err in his\r\ncalculations so far as the operations on shore were concerned.\r\n\r\nHe himself remained in Japan throughout the whole war. He went to\r\nNagoya towards the close of 1592 and stayed there until the beginning\r\nof 1594, and it was generally understood that he intended ultimately\r\nto assume direct command of the oversea armies. In fact, at a council\r\nheld to consider this matter, he proposed to cross the water at the\r\nhead of one hundred and fifty thousand men, handing over the\r\nadministration of affairs in Japan to Ieyasu. On that occasion, one\r\nof his most trusted followers, Asano Nagamasa, provoked a violent\r\noutburst of temper on Hideyoshi's part by declaring that such a\r\nscheme would be an act of lunacy, since Hideyoshi's presence alone\r\nsecured the empire against recurrence of domestic strife. The annals\r\nare not very clear at this point, but everything seems to indicate\r\nthat Hideyoshi's purpose of leading the armies in person would have\r\nbeen carried into practice had it not become certain that the\r\ninvasion of China would have to be abandoned. The time and the manner\r\nin which this failure became clear will be seen as we proceed.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FROM THE INVADER'S POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\nThe sea which separates Japan from the Korean peninsula narrows on\r\nthe south to a strait divided by the island of Tsushima into two\r\nchannels of nearly equal width. Tsushima had, for centuries, been the\r\nJapanese outpost in this part of the empire. To reach the island from\r\nthe Japanese side was always an easy and safe task, but in the\r\nfifty-six-mile channel that separates Tsushima from the peninsula of\r\nKorea an invading flotilla had to run the risk of an attack by Korean\r\nwarships.* The army assembled at Nagoya totalled over three hundred\r\nthousand men, whereof some seventy thousand constituted the first\r\nfighting line and eighty-seven thousand the second, the remainder\r\nforming a reserve to meet contingencies. The question of maritime\r\ntransport presented some difficulty, but was solved by the expedient\r\nof ordering each maritime feudatory to furnish two large ships for\r\nevery hundred thousand koku of the fief's assessment, and their crews\r\nwere obtained by compelling each fishing village to furnish ten\r\nsailors for every hundred houses it contained. These were not\r\nfighting vessels but mere transports. Fighting men to the number of\r\nninety-two hundred were, however, distributed among the ships, and\r\nwere armed with match-locks, bows, and swords. The problem of\r\ncommissariat was very formidable. This part of the enterprise was\r\nentrusted solely to Asano Nagamasa, minister of Justice, one of the\r\nfive bugyo,--that is to say, five officials called administrators, in\r\nwhose intelligence and competence Hideyoshi placed signal reliance.\r\nIn the records of the Asano family it is stated that an immense\r\nquantity of rice was shipped at the outset, but that on landing in\r\nKorea the army found ample supplies of grain in every castle\r\nthroughout the peninsula. Nevertheless, the problem of provisions\r\nultimately became exceedingly difficult, as might well have been\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\n*See the Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nPLAN OF CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nAs for the plan of campaign, it was precisely in accord with the\r\nprinciples of modern strategy. The van, consisting of three army\r\ncorps, was to cross rapidly to Fusan on the south coast of the\r\npeninsula, whence a movement northward, towards the capital, Seoul,\r\nwas to be immediately commenced, one corps marching by the eastern\r\ncoast-road, one by the central route, and one by the western.\r\n\"Thereafter the other four corps, which formed the first fighting\r\nline, together with the corps under the direct orders of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, Ukita Hideiye, were to cross for the purpose of\r\neffectually subduing the regions through which the van had passed;\r\nand, finally, the two remaining corps of the second line were to be\r\ntransported by sea up the west coast of the peninsula, to form a\r\njunction with the van which, by that time, should be preparing to\r\npass into China over the northern boundary of Korea, namely, the Yalu\r\nRiver. For the landing-place of these re-enforcements the town of\r\nPyong-yang was adopted, being easily accessible by the Tadong River\r\nfrom the coast. In later ages, Japanese armies were destined to move\r\ntwice over these same regions, once to the invasion of China [in\r\n1894], once to the attack of Russia [in 1904], and they adopted\r\nalmost the same strategical plan as that mapped out by Hideyoshi in\r\nthe year 1592. The forecast was that the Koreans would offer their\r\nchief resistance, first, at the capital, Seoul; next at Pyong-yang,\r\nand finally at the Yalu, as the approaches to all these places\r\nconstituted positions capable of being utilized to great advantage\r\nfor defensive purposes.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH TO SEOUL\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May, 1592, the first army corps (18,700 men), under\r\nthe command of Konishi Yukinaga, crossed unmolested to the peninsula.\r\nSo little did the Koreans anticipate an invasion that the earliest\r\nintelligence they had of the advent of the invaders was furnished by\r\nthe commandant of Fusan, who happened that day to be hunting on Deer\r\nIsland at the entrance to the harbour, and who sighted the approach\r\nof the hostile flotilla. On the 25th, Konishi's troops carried the\r\ncastle of Fusan by storm, after a brave resistance by the garrison,\r\nand, on the 27th, the same fate befell another and stronger fortress\r\nlying three miles inland and garrisoned by twenty thousand picked\r\nsoldiers. Four days after the landing of Konishi's army, the second\r\ncorps (20,800 strong), under Kato Kiyomasa, reached Fusan, and\r\nimmediately took the east-coast road, according to the programme of\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThenceforth, however, it was really a race between the two armies as\r\nto which should form the van. At the pass of Cho-ryung a reunion was\r\neffected. This position offered exceptional facilities for defence,\r\nbut owing to some unexplained reason no attempt was made by the\r\nKoreans to hold it. A few miles further north stood a castle reckoned\r\nthe strongest fortress in the peninsula. Konishi and Kato continued\r\nthe combination of their forces as they approached this position,\r\nbut, contrary to expectation, the Koreans fought in the open and the\r\ncastle fell without difficulty. Thereafter, the two corps separated,\r\nKato taking the westerly road and Konishi the direct route to Seoul.\r\nIn short, although the two generals have been accused of crippling\r\nthemselves by jealous competition, the facts indicate that they\r\nco-operated effectively as far as the river Imjin, where a strenuous\r\neffort to check them was expected to be made by the Koreans.\r\n\r\nFrom the landing place at Fusan to the gates of Seoul the distance is\r\n267 miles. Konishi's corps covered that interval in nineteen days,\r\nstorming two forts, carrying two positions, and fighting one pitched\r\nbattle on the way. Kato's corps, travelling by a circuitous and more\r\narduous road but not meeting with so much resistance, traversed the\r\ndistance between Fusan and the capital in four days less. At Seoul,\r\nwith its thirty thousand battlements and three times as many\r\nembrasures, requiring a garrison ninety thousand strong, only seven\r\nthousand were available, and nothing offered except flight, a course\r\nwhich the Royal Court adopted without hesitation, leaving the city to\r\nbe looted and partially destroyed, not by the Japanese invaders but\r\nby the Korean inhabitants themselves.\r\n\r\nThe King did not halt until he had placed the Imjin River between\r\nhimself and the enemy. Moreover, as soon as he there received news of\r\nthe sack of the city, he renewed his flight northward and took up his\r\nquarters at Pyong-yang. It was on the 12th of June that the Korean\r\ncapital fell, and by the 16th four army corps had assembled there,\r\nwhile four others had effected a landing at Fusan. After a rest of\r\nfifteen days, the northern advance was resumed from Seoul, with the\r\nexpectation that a great struggle would take place on the banks of\r\nthe Imjin. The conditions were eminently favourable for defence,\r\ninasmuch as the approach to the river from the south was only by one\r\nnarrow gulch, whereas, on the northern side, lay a long, sandy\r\nstretch where troops could easily be deployed. Moreover the Japanese\r\nhad no boats wherewith to negotiate a broad and swiftly flowing\r\nriver. During ten days the invaders remained helpless on the southern\r\nbank. Then the Koreans allowed themselves to be betrayed by the\r\ncommon device of a simulated retreat. They crossed in exultant\r\npursuit, only to find that they had been trapped into an ambush.\r\nKonishi and Kato now again separated, the former continuing the\r\ndirect advance northward, and the latter taking the northeastern\r\nroute, which he ultimately followed along the whole of the coast as\r\nfar as Kyong-sang, whence he turned inland and finally reached\r\nHai-ryong, a place destined to acquire much importance in modern\r\ntimes as the point of junction of the Kilin-Korean railways.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Seoul to Pyong-yang on the Tadong is 130 miles, and\r\nit was traversed by the Japanese in eighteen days, ten of which had\r\nbeen occupied in forcing the passage of the Imjin. On the southern\r\nbank of the Tadong, the invaders found themselves in a position even\r\nmore difficult than that which had confronted them at the Imjin. They\r\nhad to pass a wide rapid river with a walled city of great strength\r\non its northern bank and with all the boats in the possession of the\r\nKorean garrison, which was believed to be very numerous. Some\r\nparleying took place, and the issue of the situation seemed very\r\ndoubtful when the Koreans lost patience and crossed the river, hoping\r\nto destroy the Japanese by a night attack. They miscalculated the\r\ntime required for this operation, and daylight compelled them to\r\nabandon the enterprise when its only result had been to disclose to\r\nthe invaders the whereabouts of the fords. Then ensued a disorderly\r\nretreat on the part of the Koreans, and there being no time for the\r\nlatter to fire the town, storehouses full of grain fell into the\r\nhands of the invaders. The Korean Court resumed its flight as far as\r\nWi-ju, a few miles south of the Yalu River, whence messengers were\r\nsent to China to solicit succour.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMAND OF THE SEA\r\n\r\nThus far, everything had marched in perfect accord with the Japanese\r\nprogramme. A force of nearly two hundred thousand men had been\r\ncarried over the sea and had overrun practically the whole of Korea.\r\n\"At this point, however, the invasion suffered a check owing to a\r\ncause which in modern times has received much attention, though in\r\nHideyoshi's days it had been little considered; the Japanese lost the\r\ncommand of the sea. The Japanese idea of sea fighting in those times\r\nwas to use open boats propelled chiefly by oars. They closed as\r\nquickly as possible with the enemy and then fell on with the\r\ntrenchant swords which they used so skilfully. Now, during the\r\nfifteenth century and part of the sixteenth, the Chinese had been so\r\nharassed by Japanese piratical raids that their inventive genius,\r\nquickened by suffering, suggested a device for coping with these\r\nformidable adversaries. Once allow the Japanese swordsman to come to\r\nclose quarters and he carried all before him. To keep him at a\r\ndistance, then, was the great desideratum, and the Chinese compassed\r\nthis in maritime warfare by completely covering their boats with\r\nroofs of solid timber, so that those within were protected against\r\nmissiles or other weapons, while loop-holes and ports enabled them to\r\npour bullets and arrows on a foe.\r\n\r\n\"The Koreans learned this device from the Chinese and were the first\r\nto employ it in actual warfare. Their own history alleges that they\r\nimproved upon the Chinese model by nailing sheet iron over the roofs\r\nand sides of the 'turtle-shell' craft and studding the whole surface\r\nwith chevaux de frise, but Japanese annals indicate that in the great\r\nmajority of cases timber alone was used. It seems strange that the\r\nJapanese should have been without any clear perception of the immense\r\nfighting superiority possessed by such protected war-vessels over\r\nsmall open boats. But certainly they were either ignorant or\r\nindifferent. The fleet which they provided to hold the command of\r\nKorean waters did not include one vessel of any magnitude; it\r\nconsisted simply of some hundreds of row-boats manned by seven\r\nthousand men. Hideyoshi himself was perhaps not without misgivings.\r\nSix years previously, he had endeavoured to obtain two war-galleons\r\nfrom the Portuguese, and had he succeeded, the history of the Far\r\nEast might have been radically different. Evidently, however, he\r\ncommitted a blunder which his countrymen in modern times have\r\nconspicuously avoided; he drew the sword without having fully\r\ninvestigated his adversary's resources.\r\n\r\n\"Just about the time when the van of the Japanese army was entering\r\nSeoul, the Korean admiral, Yi Sun-sin, at the head of a fleet of\r\neighty vessels, attacked the Japanese squadron which lay at anchor\r\nnear the entrance to Fusan harbour, set twenty-six of the vessels on\r\nfire, and dispersed the rest. Four other engagements ensued in rapid\r\nsuccession. The last and most important took place shortly after the\r\nJapanese troops had seized Pyong-yang. It resulted in the sinking of\r\nover seventy Japanese vessels, transports and fighting ships\r\ncombined, which formed the main part of a flotilla carrying\r\nreinforcements by sea to the van of the invading army. This despatch\r\nof troops and supplies by water had been a leading feature of\r\nHideyoshi's plan of campaign, and the destruction of the flotilla to\r\nwhich the duty was entrusted may be said to have sealed the fate of\r\nthe war by isolating the army in Korea from its home base.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that Konishi Yukinaga, who commanded the first division,\r\ndesired to continue his northward march from Pyong-yang without\r\ndelay. He argued that China was wholly unprepared, and that the best\r\nhope of ultimate victory lay in not giving her time to collect her\r\nforces. But the commander-in-chief, Ukita Hideiye, refused to endorse\r\nthis plan. He took the view that since the Korean provinces were\r\nstill offering desperate resistance, supplies could not be drawn from\r\nthem, neither could the troops engaged in subjugating them be freed\r\nfor service at the front. Therefore it was essential to await the\r\nconsummation of the second phase of Hideyoshi's plan, namely, the\r\ndespatch of re-enforcements and munitions by water to Pyong-yang. The\r\nreader has seen how that second phase fared. The Japanese commander\r\nat Pyong-yang never received any accession of strength. His force\r\nsuffered constant diminution from casualties, and the question of\r\ncommissariat became daily more difficult. . . . Japanese historians\r\nthemselves admit the fact that no wise effort was made to conciliate\r\nthe Korean people. They were treated so harshly that even the humble\r\npeasant took up arms, and thus the peninsula, instead of serving as a\r\nbasis of supplies, had to be garrisoned perpetually by a strong\r\narmy.\"* Korean historians give long and minute accounts of the\r\ndevelopment and exploits of guerilla bands, which, though they did\r\nnot obtain any signal victory over the invaders, harassed the latter\r\nperpetually, and compelled them to devote a large part of their force\r\nto guarding the lines of communication.\r\n\r\n*Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by Brinkley.\r\n\r\nCHINESE INTERFERENCE\r\n\r\nHaving suffered for their loyalty to China, the Koreans naturally\r\nlooked to her for succour. Peking should have understood the\r\nsituation thoroughly. Even without any direct communication from\r\nJapan, the Peking Court had cognizance of Hideyoshi's intentions. A\r\nletter addressed by him in the year 1591 to the King of Ryukyu stated\r\nclearly his intention of extending Japanese sovereignty throughout\r\nthe whole Orient, and the ruler of Ryukyu had lost no time in making\r\nthis fact known to Peking.* Yet it does not appear that the Chinese\r\nhad any just appreciation of the situation. Their first response to\r\nKorea's appeal was to mobilize a force of five thousand men in the\r\nLiaotung peninsula, which force crossed the Yalu and moved against\r\nPyong-yang, where the Japanese van had been lying idle for over two\r\nmonths. This occurred early in October, 1592. The incident\r\nillustrated China's confidence in her own superiority. \"The whole of\r\nthe Korean forces had been driven northward throughout the entire\r\nlength of the peninsula by Japanese armies, yet Peking considered\r\nthat five thousand Chinese braves would suffice to roll back this\r\ntide of invasion.\"\r\n\r\n*There is still extant a letter addressed by Hideypshi in June, 1592,\r\nto Hidetsugu, his nephew, and then nominal successor. In this\r\ndocument it is distinctly stated that the attention of the Emperor of\r\nJapan should be directed to the Chinese capital, inasmuch as the\r\nJapanese Court would pay a visit to Peking in 1594, on which occasion\r\nthe ten provinces surrounding the Chinese capital would be presented\r\nto his Majesty, and out of this territory the Court nobles would\r\nreceive estates.\r\n\r\nThe result was a foregone conclusion. Three thousand of the Chinese\r\nwere killed, and the rest fled pele-mele across the Yalu. China now\r\nbegan to be seriously alarmed. She despatched to Pyong-yang an envoy\r\nnamed Chen Weiching--known in Japanese history as Chin Ikei--who was\r\ninstructed not to conclude peace but only to make such overtures as\r\nmight induce the Japanese to agree to an armistice, thus enabling the\r\nChinese authorities to mobilize a sufficient force. Konishi Yukinaga\r\nfell into this trap. He agreed to an armistice of fifty days, during\r\nwhich the Japanese pledged themselves not to advance more than three\r\nmiles northward of Pyong-yang while Chen proceeded to Peking to\r\narrange terms of peace. It is very evident that had the Japanese seen\r\nany certain prospect of proceeding to the invasion of China, they\r\nwould not have agreed to such an arrangement as this--an arrangement\r\nwhich guaranteed nothing except leisure for the mobilization of a\r\nstrong Chinese army. It had, indeed, become plain to the Japanese\r\ncommanders, after six months of operations in the peninsula, that the\r\nwisest course for them was to arrange a satisfactory peace.\r\n\r\nThe second force put in the field by China is estimated by the\r\nJesuits and the Japanese at 200,000 men and at 51,000 by Korean\r\nhistory. Probably the truth lies midway between the two extremes.\r\nThis powerful army moved across Manchuria in the dead of winter and\r\nhurled itself against Pyong-yang during the first week of February,\r\n1593. The Japanese garrison at that place cannot have greatly\r\nexceeded twenty thousand men, for nearly one-half of its original\r\nnumber had been detached to hold a line of forts guarding the\r\ncommunications with Seoul. Neither Chinese nor Japanese history\r\ncomments on the instructive fact that the arrival of this army under\r\nthe walls of Pyong-yang was China's answer to her envoy's promise of\r\na satisfactory peace, nor does it appear that any discredit attached\r\nto Chen Weiching for the deception he had practised; his competence\r\nas a negotiator was subsequently admitted without cavil. The Chinese,\r\nthough their swords were much inferior to the Japanese weapon,\r\npossessed great superiority in field artillery and cavalry, as well\r\nas in the fact that their troopers wore iron mail which defied the\r\nkeenest blade. Thus, after a severe fight which cost the Japanese\r\ntwenty-three hundred men, they had to evacuate Pyong-yang and retreat\r\ntowards Seoul, the army under Kato Kiyomasa retiring at the same time\r\nfrom the northeast and fighting its way back to the central route.\r\nOrders were then issued by the commander-in-chief, Ukita, for the\r\nwhole of the Japanese forces in the north of the peninsula to\r\nconcentrate in Seoul, but Kohayakawa, one of Hideyoshi's most trusted\r\ngenerals, whose name has occurred more than once in these annals,\r\nconducted a splendid covering movement at a place a few miles\r\nnorthward of Seoul, the result of which was that the Chinese fled in\r\nhaste over the Injin, losing ten thousand men in their retreat.\r\n\r\nBut, though the Japanese had thus shaken off the pursuit, it was\r\nimpossible for them to continue in occupation of Seoul. The\r\nconditions existing there were shocking. Widespread famine menaced,\r\nwith its usual concomitant, pestilence. According to Korean history,\r\nthe streets of the city and the roads in the suburbs were piled with\r\ncorpses to a height of ten feet above the wall. The Japanese,\r\ntherefore, made proposals of peace, and the Chinese agreed, on\r\ncondition that the Japanese gave up two Korean princes held captive\r\nby them, and retired to the south coast of the peninsula. These terms\r\nwere accepted, and on May 9, 1593, that is to say, 360 days after the\r\nlanding of the invaders' van at Fusan, the evacuation of the Korean\r\ncapital took place. The Chinese commanders showed great lack of\r\nenterprise. They failed to utilize the situation, and in October of\r\nthe same year they withdrew from the peninsula all their troops\r\nexcept ten thousand men. Negotiations for permanent peace now\r\ncommenced between the Governments of Japan and China, but while the\r\npourparlers were in progress the most sanguinary incident of the\r\nwhole war took place. During the early part of the campaign a\r\nJapanese attack had been beaten back from Chinju, which was reckoned\r\nthe strongest fortress in Korea. Hideyoshi now ordered that the\r\nJapanese troops, before sailing for home, should rehabilitate their\r\nreputation by capturing this place, where the Koreans had mustered a\r\nstrong army. The order was obeyed. Continuous assaults were delivered\r\nagainst the fortress during the space of nine days, and when it\r\npassed into Japanese possession the Koreans are said to have lost\r\nbetween sixty and seventy thousand men and the casualties on the\r\nJapanese side must have been almost as numerous.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGOTIATIONS\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Chinju, all the Japanese troops, with the exception\r\nof Konishi's corps, were withdrawn from Korea, and the Japanese\r\nconfined their operations to holding a cordon of twelve fortified\r\ncamps along the southern coast of the peninsula. These camps were\r\nnothing more than bluffs overlooking the sea on the south, and\r\nprotected on the land side by moats and earthworks. The action at\r\nChinju had created some suspicion as to the integrity of Japan's\r\ndesigns, but mainly through the persistence and tact of the Chinese\r\nenvoy, Chen Weiching, terms were agreed upon, and on October 21,\r\n1596, a Chinese mission reached Japan and proceeded to Osaka. The\r\nisland had just then been visited by a series of uniquely disastrous\r\nearthquakes, which had either overthrown or rendered uninhabitable\r\nall the great edifices in and around Kyoto. One corner of Osaka\r\nCastle alone remained intact, and there the mission was received.\r\nHideyoshi refused to give audience to the Korean members of the\r\nmission, and welcomed the Chinese members only, from whom he expected\r\nto receive a document placing him on a royal pinnacle at least as\r\nhigh as that occupied by the Emperor of China. The document actually\r\ntransmitted to him was of a very different significance as the\r\nfollowing extract shows:\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, who respects and obeys heaven and is favoured by\r\nProvidence, commands that he be honoured and loved wherever the\r\nheavens overhang and the earth upbears. The Imperial command is\r\nuniversal; even as far as the bounds of ocean where the sun rises,\r\nthere are none who do not obey it. In ancient times our Imperial\r\nancestors bestowed their favours on many lands: the Tortoise Knots\r\nand the Dragon Writing were sent to the limits of far Japan; the pure\r\nalabaster and the great-seal character were granted to the monarchs\r\nof the submissive country. Thereafter came billowy times when\r\ncommunications were interrupted, but an auspicious opportunity has\r\nnow arrived when it has pleased us again to address you. You,\r\nToyotomi Taira Hideyoshi, having established an Island kingdom and\r\nknowing the reverence due to the Central Land, sent to the west an\r\nenvoy, and with gladness and affection offered your allegiance. On\r\nthe north you knocked at the barrier of ten thousand li, and\r\nearnestly requested to be admitted within our dominions. Your mind is\r\nalready confirmed in reverent submissiveness. How can we grudge our\r\nfavour to so great meekness? We do, therefore, specially invest you\r\nwith the dignity of \"King of Japan,\" and to that intent issue this\r\nour commission. Treasure it carefully. As a mark of our special\r\nfavour towards you, we send you over the sea a robe and crown\r\ncontained in a costly case, so that you may follow our ancient custom\r\nas respects dress. Faithfully defend the frontier of our empire; let\r\nit be your study to act worthily of your position as our minister;\r\npractice moderation and self-restraint; cherish gratitude for the\r\nImperial favour so bountifully bestowed upon you; change not your\r\nfidelity; be humbly guided by our admonitions; continue always to\r\nfollow our instructions.*\r\n\r\n*Quoted by W. Dening in A New Life of Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi had already donned the robe and crown mentioned in the\r\nabove despatch, his belief being that they represented his\r\ninvestiture as sovereign of Ming. On learning the truth, he tore off\r\nthe insignia and flung them on the ground in a fit of ungovernable\r\nwrath at the arrogance of the Chinese Emperor's tone. It had never\r\nbeen distinctly explained how this extraordinary misunderstanding\r\narose, but the most credible solution of the problem is that Naito,\r\nbaron of Tamba, who had proceeded to Peking for the purpose of\r\nnegotiating peace, was so overawed by the majesty and magnificence of\r\nthe Chinese Court that, instead of demanding Hideyoshi's investiture\r\nas monarch of China, he stated that nothing was needed except China's\r\nformal acknowledgement of the kwampaku's real rank. Hideyoshi, in his\r\nnatural anger, ordered the Chinese ambassadors to be dismissed\r\nwithout any written answer and without any of the gifts usual on such\r\noccasions according to the diplomatic custom of the Orient.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, induced not to prosecute his quarrel with the Middle\r\nKingdom, and he turned his anger entirely against Korea. Accordingly,\r\non March 19, 1597, nine fresh corps were mobilized for oversea\r\nservice, and these being thrown into Korea, brought the Japanese\r\nforces in that country to a total of 141,000 men. But the campaign\r\nwas not at first resumed with activity proportionate to this great\r\narmy. The Japanese commanders seem to have waited for some practical\r\nassurances that the command of the sea would not be again wrested\r\nfrom them; a natural precaution seeing that, after five years' war,\r\nKorea herself was no longer in a position to make any contributions\r\nto the commissariat of the invaders. It is a very interesting fact\r\nthat, on this occasion, the Japanese victories at sea were as signal\r\nas their defeats had been in 1592. The Korean navy comprised the same\r\nvessels which were supposed to have proved so formidable five years\r\npreviously, but the Japanese naval architects had risen to the level\r\nof the occasion, and the Korean fleet was well-nigh annihilated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Chinese had sent a powerful army to southern Korea,\r\nand against these fresh forces the Japanese attacks were directed.\r\nEverywhere the invaders were victorious, and very soon the three\r\nsouthern provinces of the peninsula had been captured. No actual\r\nreverse was met with throughout, but an indecisive victory near\r\nChiksan, in the north of the metropolitan province, rendered it\r\nimpossible for the Japanese to establish themselves in Seoul before\r\nthe advent of winter, and they therefore judged it advisable to\r\nretire to their seaboard chain of entrenched camps. Early in 1598, a\r\nfresh army of forty thousand men reached Seoul from China, and for a\r\nmoment the situation seemed to threaten disaster for the Japanese.\r\nTheir strategy and desperate valour proved invincible, however, and\r\nthe Kagoshima samurai won, on October 30, 1598, a victory so signal\r\nthat the ears and noses of thirty-seven thousand Chinese heads were\r\nsent to Japan and buried under a tumulus near the temple of Daibutsu\r\nin Kyoto, where this terrible record, called Mimizuka (Mound of\r\nEars), may be seen to-day.\r\n\r\nJust about this time, intelligence of the death of Hideyoshi reached\r\nthe Japanese commanders in Korea, and immediately an armistice was\r\narranged. The withdrawal of the invading forces followed, not without\r\nsome serious difficulties, and thus the six years' campaign\r\nterminated without any direct results except an immense loss of life\r\nand treasure and the reduction of the Korean peninsula to a state of\r\ndesolation. It has been repeatedly pleaded for the wholly\r\nunprogressive state into which Korea thenceforth fell. But to\r\nconclude that a nation could be reduced by a six-years' war to three\r\ncenturies of hopelessness and helplessness is to credit that nation\r\nwith a very small measure of resilient capacity.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe war was not altogether without indirect results of some value to\r\nJapan. Among these may be cited the fact that, a few decades later,\r\nwhen the Tsing dynasty destroyed the Ming in China, subjugated Korea,\r\nand assumed a position analogous to that previously held by the Yuan,\r\nno attempt was made to defy Japan. The memory of her soldiers'\r\nachievements on the Korean battle-fields sufficed to protect her\r\nagainst foreign aggression. Another material result was that, in\r\ncompliance with Hideyoshi's orders, the returning Japanese generals\r\nbrought back many Korean art-artisans who contributed largely to the\r\ndevelopment of the ceramic industry. On no less than seven different\r\nkinds of now well-known porcelain and pottery in Japan did these\r\nexperts exercise marked influence, and their efforts were specially\r\ntimely in view of the great vogue then enjoyed by all utensils used\r\nin connexion with the tea ceremonial. It is not to be supposed,\r\nhowever, that these Korean artisans showed any superiority to the\r\nJapanese as artists. The improvements they introduced were almost\r\nentirely of a technical character. Another benefit derived by Japan\r\nfrom her contact with Korea at this time was the introduction of\r\nmovable type. Up to this time the art of printing had been in a very\r\nprimitive condition in Japan, and the first book printed with movable\r\ntype made its appearance in the Bunroku era (1592-1595).\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SIGNATURE OF TAKEDA SHINGEN\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: NAGOYA CASTLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE MOMO-YAMA EPOCH\r\n\r\nMOMO-YAMA\r\n\r\nTHE epochs of Japanese history from the eighth century until the fall\r\nof the Ashikaga shogunate are generally divided into the Nara, the\r\nHeian, the Kamakura, the Muromachi, and the Higashi-yama. To these\r\nhas now to be added the Momo-yama (Peach Hill), a term derived from\r\nthe name of a palatial residence built by Hideyoshi in the Fushimi\r\nsuburb of Kyoto. The project was conceived in 1593, that is to say,\r\nduring the course of the Korean campaign, and the business of\r\ncollecting materials was managed on such a colossal scale that the\r\nfoundations could be laid by September in the same year. Two months\r\nsufficed not only to construct a mansion of extraordinary\r\nmagnificence and most elaborate interior decoration, but also to\r\nsurround it with a spacious park presenting all the choicest features\r\nof Japanese landscape gardens. The annals state that fifty thousand\r\nmen were engaged on the work, and the assertion ceases to seem\r\nextravagant when we consider the nature of the task and the\r\nsingularly brief period devoted to its completion. It was Hideyoshi's\r\nfoible to surpass all his predecessors and contemporaries alike in\r\nthe magnitude of his designs and in the celerity of their\r\nachievement. Even his pastimes were conceived on the same stupendous\r\nscale. Thus, in 1594, at the very time when his armies in Korea were\r\nconducting an oversea campaign of unprecedented magnitude, he planned\r\na flower-viewing fete which will live in the pages of history as more\r\nsumptuous and more magnificent than the hitherto unrivalled\r\nfestivities of Yoshimasa. The places visited were the cherry-clad\r\nhills of Yoshino and the venerable monastery of Koya, and some idea\r\nof the scale of the fete may be gathered from the fact that to a\r\nshrine on Koya-san, dedicated to the memory of his mother, Hideyoshi\r\npresented a sum equivalent to £14,000 or $68,000.\r\n\r\nStill more lavish was a party organized four years later to visit the\r\ncherry blossoms at Daigo in the suburbs of Kyoto. This involved the\r\nrebuilding of a large Buddhist temple (Sambo-in) to accommodate\r\nHideyoshi and his party as a temporary resting-place, and involved\r\nalso the complete enclosing of the roads from Momo-yama to Daigo, as\r\nwell as of a wide space surrounding the slopes of the cherry-clad\r\nhills, with fences festooned in silk curtains. Numerous tea pavilions\r\nwere erected, and Hideyoshi, having sent home all his male guests and\r\nattendants, remained himself among a multitude of gorgeously\r\napparelled ladies, and passed from pavilion to pavilion, listening to\r\nmusic, witnessing dancing, and viewing works of art.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI'S FAMILY\r\n\r\nA conspicuous figure at the Daigo fete was Hideyori, the\r\nfive-year-old son of Hideyoshi. Fate treated Hideyoshi harshly in the\r\nmatter of a successor. His younger brother, Hidenaga, perished on the\r\nthreshold of a career that promised to be illustrious; his infant\r\nson, Tsurumatsu, passed away in September, 1591, and Hideyoshi, being\r\nthen in his fifty-fourth year, saw little prospect of becoming again\r\na father. He therefore adopted his nephew, Hidetsugu, ceding to him\r\nthe office of regent (kwampaku), and thus himself taking the title of\r\nTaiko, which by usage attached to an ex-regent.* Hidetsugu, then in\r\nhis twenty-fourth year, had literary gifts and polite accomplishments\r\nmuch above the average. But traditions--of somewhat doubtful\r\nveracity, it must be admitted--attributed to him an inhuman love of\r\ntaking life, and tell of the indulgence of that mood in shocking\r\nways. On the other hand, if credence be due to these tales, it seems\r\nstrange that they were not included in the accusations preferred\r\nfinally against Hidetsugu by the Taiko, when the former's overthrow\r\nbecame advisable in the latter's eyes. For it did so become. Within\r\nless than two years of Hidetsugu's elevation to the post of regent,\r\nanother son was born to Hideyoshi by the same lady, Yodo, the demise\r\nof whose child, Tsurumatsu, had caused Hideyoshi to despair of being\r\nsucceeded by an heir of his own lineage. A niece of Oda Nobunaga,\r\nthis lady was the eldest of three daughters whose mother shared the\r\nsuicide of her husband, the great general, Shibata Katsuiye.\r\nHideyoshi placed her among his consorts, bestowing upon her the\r\ncastle of Yodo, hence her name, Yodogimi. Her rare beauty captivated\r\nthe veteran statesman and soldier, and won for her suggestions a\r\nmeasure of deference which they did not intrinsically deserve. Soon\r\nthe court became divided into two cliques, distinguished as the\r\n\"civil\" and the \"military.\" At the head of the latter stood\r\nHideyoshi's wife, Yae, a lady gifted with large discernment, who had\r\nshared all the vicissitudes of her husband's fortunes, and acted as\r\nhis shrewd and loyal adviser on many occasions. With her were Kato\r\nKiyomasa and other generals and nobles of distinction. The civil\r\nparty espoused the cause of the lady Yodo, and among its followers\r\nwas Ishida Katsushige, to whom chiefly the ultimate catastrophe is\r\nattributed by history.\r\n\r\n*It is by this title, \"Taiko,\" that Hideyoshi is most frequently\r\nspoken of in History.\r\n\r\nThe birth of Hideyori on August 29, 1593, immediately actuated the\r\ndissensions among these two cliques. Ishida Katsushige, acting in\r\nHideyori's interests, set himself to convince the Taiko that\r\nHidetsugu harboured treacherous designs, and Hideyoshi, too readily\r\nallowing himself to credit tales which promised to remove the one\r\nobstacle to his son's succession, ordered Hidetsugu to commit\r\nsuicide, and at the same time (August 8, 1595), sentenced his\r\nconcubines to be executed in the dry bed of the river Sanjo. Their\r\nheads, together with that of Hidetsugu himself, were buried in the\r\nsame grave, over which was set a tablet bearing the inscription,\r\n\"Tomb of the Traitor, Hidetsugu.\" To this day, historians remain\r\nuncertain as to Hidetsugu's guilt. If the evidence sufficed to\r\nconvict him, it does not appear to have been transmitted to\r\nposterity. The Taiko was not by nature a cruel man. Occasionally fits\r\nof passion betrayed him to deeds of great violence. Thus, on one\r\noccasion he ordered the crucifixion of twenty youths whose sole\r\noffence consisted in scribbling on the gate-posts of the Juraku\r\npalace. But in cold blood he always showed himself forebearing, and\r\nletters written by his own hand to his mother, his wife, and others\r\ndisclose an affectionate and sympathetic disposition. It would be\r\nunjust to assume that without full testimony such a man sentenced a\r\nwhole family of his own relatives to be executed.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MAEDA TOSHIIYE\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI'S DEATH\r\n\r\nA few months after the Daigo fete, Hideyoshi was overtaken by mortal\r\nsickness. His last days were tormented by the thought that all his\r\nskill as an organizer and all his power as a ruler were incompetent\r\nto devise a system such as would secure the succession to his child.\r\nIn June, 1596, he had procured the investiture of Hideyori, then\r\nthree years old, with the title of regent, and when, just two years\r\nlater, his own sickness began to develop alarming features, he\r\nresolved to place all his trust in Ieyasu. After much thought three\r\nboards were ordered to be formed: one consisted of five senior\r\nministers (dairo), its personnel being Tokugawa Ieyasu, Mori\r\nTerumoto, Ukita Hideiye, Maeda Toshiiye, and Uesugi Kagekatsu. By\r\nthese five statesmen the great affairs of the empire were to be\r\nmanaged. The second board was formed with three nobles of lesser\r\nnote. They were designated the \"middle ministers\" (churo), whose duty\r\nwas to arbitrate between the board of senior ministers and the third\r\nboard, namely that of five \"administrators\" (bugyo). This third board\r\nhad been originally organized by Hideyoshi in 1585, but it had not,\r\nof course, been associated with the other two boards which came into\r\nexistence after Hideyoshi's death, though its personnel and its\r\nfunctions remained throughout the same as they had been originally.\r\nAgain and again, with almost pitiable iteration, the Taiko conjured\r\nthe thirteen nobles forming these boards to protect Hideyori and to\r\nensure to him the heirship of his father's great fortunes. Each was\r\nrequired to subscribe a written oath of eight articles:\r\n\r\n(1) That they would serve Hideyori with the same single-minded\r\nloyalty they had shown to his father.\r\n\r\n(2) That the rules of Hideyoshi's house were not to be altered; and\r\nthat if, in the administration of public affairs, the five bugyo were\r\nunable to determine a course of action, they should consult Hideyori\r\nthrough Ieyasu and Toshiie; or, if necessary before taking action,\r\nthe Emperor was to be consulted.\r\n\r\n(3) That there were to be no factions among them, personal\r\nconsiderations and partiality of every kind being excluded from their\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\n(4) That they must endeavour to work together in the discharge of\r\ntheir duties, suppressing all petty jealousies and differences.\r\n\r\n(5) That, in settling matters, the opinion of the majority was\r\nusually to be followed, but, at the same time, if the opinion of the\r\nminority showed no sign of being dictated by personal interests, it\r\nshould be duly considered. That without permission from Hideyori no\r\nadministrator should dispose of any of his (the administrator's)\r\nterritory to another person.\r\n\r\n(6) That all accounts were to be kept in a manner above suspicion;\r\nthat there were to be no irregularities and no pursuing of personal\r\ninterests; that no questions concerning landed estates should be\r\ndealt with during the minority of Hideyori; that no petitions should\r\nbe presented to him, and that Ieyasu himself would neither ask for\r\nchanges to be made in the matter of land-ownership nor accept any\r\ngift of land from Hideyori during the latter's minority.\r\n\r\n(7) That whatever Hideyori desired to have kept secret, whether\r\nconnected with his private life or with the Government, must on no\r\naccount be allowed to leak out.\r\n\r\n(8) That if any of the administrators or their subordinates found\r\nthat they had unwittingly acted contrary to orders, they should at\r\nonce report the fact to their superiors, who would then deal\r\nleniently with them.\r\n\r\nThe above document was solemnly endorsed, the gods being called upon\r\nto punish any one violating its provisions. It was further ordered\r\nthat Hidetada, son of Ieyasu, should give his daughter in marriage to\r\nHideyori; that Ieyasu, residing in the Fushimi palace, should act as\r\nregent until Hideyori reached the age of fifteen, and that Maeda\r\nToshiiye, governing the castle of Osaka, should act as guardian of\r\nHideyori. It is recorded by some historians that the taiko conferred\r\non Ieyasu discretionary power in the matter of Hideyori's succession,\r\nauthorizing the Tokugawa baron to be guided by his own estimate of\r\nHideyori's character as to whether the latter might be safely trusted\r\nto discharge the high duties that would devolve on him when he\r\nreached his majority. But the truth of this allegation is open to\r\ndoubt. It may well have been invented, subsequently, by apologists\r\nfor the line adopted by Ieyasu. Hideyoshi died on September 18, 1598.\r\nHis last thoughts were directed to the troops in Korea. He is said to\r\nhave addressed to Asano Nagamasa and Ishida Katsushige orders to go\r\nin person to the peninsula, and to provide that \"the spirits of one\r\nhundred thousand Japanese soldiers serving there should not become\r\ndisembodied in a foreign land.\" For a time the death of the great\r\nstatesman was kept secret, but within three months the newly created\r\nboards found themselves strong enough to cope with the situation, and\r\nthe remains of Hideyoshi were publicly interred at the shrine of\r\nAmida-ga-mine, near Kyoto.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI'S CHARACTER\r\n\r\nIn modern times many distinguished Japanese historians have\r\nundertaken to analyze Hideyoshi's character and attainments. They are\r\ndivided in their estimate of his literary capacity. Some point to his\r\nletters, which, while they display a not inconsiderable familiarity\r\nwith Chinese ideographs, show also some flagrant neglect of the uses\r\nof that script. Others refer to his alleged fondness for composing\r\nJapanese poems and adduce a verselet said to have been written by him\r\non his death-bed:\r\n\r\n   Ah! as the dew I fall,\r\n   As the dew I vanish.\r\n   Even Osaka fortress\r\n   Is a dream within a dream.\r\n\r\nIt is not certain, however, that Hideyoshi composed this couplet, and\r\nprobably the truth is that his labours as a soldier and a statesman\r\nprevented him from paying more than transitory attention to\r\nliterature. But there can be no question that he possessed an almost\r\nmarvellous power of reading character, and that in devising the best\r\nexit from serious dilemmas and the wisest means of utilizing great\r\noccasions, he has had few equals in the history of the world. He knew\r\nwell, also, how to employ pomp and circumstance and when to dispense\r\nwith all formalities. Above all, in his choice of agents he never\r\nallowed himself to be trammelled by questions of birth or lineage,\r\nbut chose his officers solely for the sake of their ability and\r\nattainments, and neither tradition nor convention had any influence\r\non the appointments he made. He was passionate but not resentful, and\r\nhe possessed the noble quality of not shrinking from confession of\r\nerror. As for his military genius and his statecraft, it is only\r\nnecessary to consider his achievements. They entitle him to stand in\r\nthe very front of the world's greatest men. Turning to his\r\nlegislation, we find much that illustrates the ethics of the time. It\r\nwas in 1585 that he organized the board of five administrators, and\r\nthe gist of the regulations issued in the following year for their\r\nguidance was as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) No subordinate shall leave his liege lord without the latter's\r\npermission, nor shall anyone give employment to a violator of this\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n(2) Farmers must remain on the land assigned to them and must never\r\nleave it untilled. On the other hand, landowners should visit their\r\ntenants and should investigate in company with the latter the actual\r\namount of the harvest reaped. One-third of this should be left to the\r\nfarmer and two-thirds should go to the owner of the land.\r\n\r\n(3) If owing to natural calamity the harvest be less than two bushels\r\nper acre, the whole of the yield shall go to the farmer. But if the\r\nharvest exceed that figure, it shall be divided in the proportions\r\nindicated in (2).\r\n\r\n(4) No farmer shall move away from his holding to avoid the land-tax\r\nor to escape forced labour. Anyone harbouring a violator of this rule\r\nshall expose to punishment not only himself but also the inhabitants\r\nof the entire village where he resides.\r\n\r\n(5) The lord of a fief must issue such instructions as shall\r\nguarantee his agricultural vassals against trouble or annoyance, and\r\nshall himself investigate local affairs instead of entrusting that\r\nduty to a substitute. Landowners who issue unreasonable orders to\r\nfarmers shall be punished.\r\n\r\n(6) In calculating cubic contents, the regulated unit of measure\r\nshall be used, and two per cent, shall be the maximum allowance for\r\nshortage.\r\n\r\n(7) Embankments injured by floods and other mischief wrought by\r\nnatural calamities must be repaired during the first month of the\r\nyear when agriculturists are at leisure. In the case, however, of\r\ndamage which exceeds the farmers' capacity to repair, the facts\r\nshould be reported to the taiko who will grant necessary assistance.\r\n\r\nThere follow various sumptuary regulations. We have next a series of\r\ninteresting instructions known as \"wall-writings\" of the castle of\r\nOsaka:\r\n\r\n(1) Intermarriages between daimyo's families require the previous\r\nconsent of the Taiko.\r\n\r\n(2) Neither daimyo nor shomyo is permitted to enter into secret\r\nengagements or to exchange written oaths, or to give or take\r\nhostages.\r\n\r\n(3) In a quarrel the one who forebears shall be recognized as having\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n(4) No man, whatever his income, should keep a large number of\r\nconcubines.\r\n\r\n(5) The amount of sake imbibed should be limited to one's capacity.\r\n\r\n(6) The use of sedan-chairs shall be confined to Ieyasu, Toshiie,\r\nKagekatsu, Terumoto, Takakage, the court nobles, and high priests.\r\nEven a daimyo, when young, should ride on horseback. Those over fifty\r\nyears of age may use a sedan-chair when they have to travel a\r\ndistance of over one ri (two and a half miles). Priests are exempted\r\nfrom this veto.\r\n\r\nVery interesting, too, is the Taiko Shikimoku, consisting of\r\nseventy-three articles, of which thirteen are translated as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Free yourself from the thraldom of passion.\r\n\r\n(2) Avoid heavy drinking.\r\n\r\n(3) Be on your guard against women.\r\n\r\n(4) Be not contentious or disputatious.\r\n\r\n(5) Rise early.\r\n\r\n(6) Beware of practical jokes.\r\n\r\n(7) Think of your own future.\r\n\r\n(8) Do not tire of things.\r\n\r\n(9) Beware of thoughtless people.\r\n\r\n(10) Beware of fire.\r\n\r\n(11) Stand in awe of the law.\r\n\r\n(12) Set up fences in your hearts against wandering or extravagant\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n(13) Hold nobody in contempt.\r\n\r\nThe sumptuary rules referred to above were that, so far as a man's\r\nmeans permitted, all garments except those worn in winter should be\r\nlined with silk, and that this exception did not apply to the members\r\nof the Toyotomi family a strange provision showing that Hideyoshi did\r\nnot expect his own kith and kin to set an example of economy, however\r\ndesirable that virtue might be in the case of society at large.\r\nFurther, it was provided that no wadded garment should be worn after\r\nthe 1st of April--corresponding to about the 1st of May in the\r\nGregorian calendar; that pantaloons and socks must not be lined; that\r\nmen of inferior position must not wear leather socks, and that\r\nsamurai must use only half-foot sandals, a specially inexpensive kind\r\nof footgear. Finally, no one was permitted to employ a crest composed\r\nwith the chrysanthemum and the Paulownia imperialis unless specially\r\npermitted by the Taiko, who used this design himself, though\r\noriginally it was limited to the members of the Imperial family. So\r\nstrict was this injunction that even in the case of renovating a\r\ngarment which carried the kiku-kiri crest by permission, the badge\r\nmight not be repeated on the restored garment. Supplementary\r\nregulations enjoined members of the priesthood, whether Buddhist or\r\nShinto, to devote themselves to the study of literature and science,\r\nand to practise what they preached. Moreover, men of small means were\r\nurged not to keep more than one concubine, and to assign for even\r\nthis one a separate house. It was strictly forbidden that anyone\r\nshould go about with face concealed, a custom which had prevailed\r\nlargely in previous eras.\r\n\r\nMOTIVES OF LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThe 7th of August, 1595, was the day of the Hidetsugu tragedy, and\r\nthe above regulations and instructions were promulgated for the most\r\npart early in September of the same year. It is not difficult to\r\ntrace a connexion. The provision against secret alliances and\r\nunsanctioned marriages between great families; the veto against\r\npassing from the service of one feudal chief to that of another\r\nwithout special permission, and the injunction against keeping many\r\nconcubines were obviously inspired with the purpose of averting a\r\nrepetition of the Hidetsugu catastrophe. Indirectly, the spirit of\r\nsuch legislation suggests that the signatories of these\r\nlaws--Takakage, Terumoto, Toshiiye, Hideiye, and Ieyasu--attached\r\nsome measure of credence to the indictment of treason preferred\r\nagainst Hidetsugu.\r\n\r\nAGRARIAN LAWS\r\n\r\nThe agrarian legislation of Hideyoshi is worthy of special attention.\r\nIt shows a marked departure from the days when the unit of rice\r\nmeasurement was a \"handful\" and when thirty-six handfuls made a\r\n\"sheaf,\" the latter being the tenth part of the produce of a tan. In\r\nHideyoshi's system, all cubic measurements were made by means of a\r\nbox of accurately fixed capacity--10 go, which was the tenth part of\r\na koku (5.13 bushels)--the allowance for short measure was limited to\r\ntwo per cent., and the rule of 360 tsubo to the tan (a quarter of an\r\nacre) was changed to 300 tsubo.\r\n\r\nAt the same time (1583), land surveyors (kendenshi) were appointed to\r\ncompile a map of the entire country. A similar step had been taken by\r\nthe Ashikaga shogun, Yoshiteru, in 1553, but the processes adopted on\r\nthat occasion were not by any means so accurate or scientific as\r\nthose prescribed by the Taiko. The latter entrusted the work of\r\nsurvey to Nazuka Masaiye, with whom was associated the best\r\nmathematician of the era, Zejobo, and it is recorded that owing to\r\nthe minute measures pursued by these surveyors and to the system of\r\ntaking two-thirds of the produce for the landlord instead of one-half\r\nor even less, and owing, finally, to estimating the tan at 300 tsubo\r\ninstead of at 360 without altering its taxable liability, the\r\nofficial revenue derived from the land throughout the empire showed a\r\ntotal increase of eight million koku, equivalent to about £11,000,000\r\nor $54,000,000.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi has been charged with extortion on account of these\r\ninnovations. Certainly, there is a striking contrast between the\r\nsystem of Tenchi and that of Toyotomi. The former, genuinely\r\nsocialistic, divided the whole of the land throughout the empire in\r\nequal portions among the units of the nation, and imposed a land-tax\r\nnot in any case exceeding five per cent, of the gross produce. The\r\nlatter, frankly feudalistic, parcelled out the land into great\r\nestates held by feudal chiefs, who allotted it in small areas to\r\nfarmers on condition that the latter paid sixty-six per cent, of the\r\ncrops to the lord of the soil. But in justice to Hideyoshi, it must\r\nbe owned that he did not devise this system. He was not even the\r\noriginator of its new methods, namely, the abbreviation of the tan\r\nand the expansion of the rate. Both had already been put into\r\npractice by other daimyo. It must further be noted that Hideyoshi's\r\nera was essentially one of war. The outlays that he was obliged to\r\nmake were enormous and perpetual. He became accustomed, as did his\r\ncontemporary barons, to look lightly at vast expenditure. Not\r\notherwise can we account for the fact that, within the brief period\r\nof eleven years, he undertook and completed five great works\r\ninvolving enormous cost. These works were the Osaka Castle, in 1583;\r\na palace for the retiring Emperor Okimachi, in 1586; the palace of\r\nJuraku, in 1587; the Kyoto Daibutsu, in 1586, and the Momo-yama\r\nPalace, in 1594. What sum these outlays aggregated no attempt has\r\nbeen made to calculate accurately, but the figure must have been\r\nimmense. In fact, when Hideyoshi's financial measures are considered,\r\nit should always be in the context of his achievements and his\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\nCOINS\r\n\r\nAnother important feature of Hideyoshi's era was the use of coins.\r\nDuring the time of the Ashikaga shogunate, two kinds of gold coins\r\nwere minted, and both were called after the name of the era when they\r\nfirst went into circulation; they were known as the Shocho koban\r\n(1428-1429) and the Tembun koban (1532-1555). But these coins were so\r\nrare that they can scarcely be said to have been current. As tokens\r\nof exchange, copper coins were imported from China, and were known in\r\nJapan as Eiraku-sen, Eiraku being the Japanese pronunciation of the\r\nChinese era, Yunglo. These were of pure metal, and side by side with\r\nthem were circulated an essentially inferior iron coin struck in\r\nJapan and known as bita-sen. Oda Nobunaga, appreciating the\r\ndisastrous effects produced by such currency confusion, had planned\r\nremedial measures when death overtook him, and the task thus devolved\r\nupon Hideyoshi. Fortunately, the production of gold and silver in\r\nJapan increased greatly at this epoch, owing to the introduction of\r\nscientific metallurgical methods from Europe. The gold mines of Sado\r\nand the silver mines of Ikuno quadrupled or quintupled their output,\r\nand Hideyoshi caused an unprecedented quantity of gold and silver\r\ncoins to be struck; the former known as the Tensho koban and the\r\nTensho oban,* and the latter as the silver bu (ichibu-giri) and the\r\nsilver half-bu (nishu-gin.)\r\n\r\n*The oban was an oval plate measuring 7 inches by 4, and weighing 53\r\nounces. It contained 63.84 per cent, of gold and 20 per cent, of\r\nsilver. The koban was one-tenth of the value of the oban.\r\n\r\nGold and silver thenceforth became the standards of value, and as the\r\nmines at Sado and Ikuno belonged to the Government, that is to say,\r\nto Hideyoshi, his wealth suddenly received a conspicuous increase.\r\nThat he did possess great riches is proved by the fact that when, in\r\nSeptember, 1596, a terrible earthquake overthrew Momo-yama Castle and\r\nwrecked all the great structures referred to above, involving for\r\nHideyoshi a loss of \"three million pieces of gold,\" he is described\r\nas having treated the incident with the utmost indifference, merely\r\ndirecting that works of reparation should be taken in hand forthwith.\r\nThe records say that Osaka Castle, which had suffered seriously and\r\nbeen rendered quite uninhabitable, was put in order and sumptuously\r\nfitted up within the short space of six weeks. Of course, much of the\r\nresulting expense had to be borne by the great feudatories, but the\r\nshare of Hideyoshi himself cannot have been inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE, ART, AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that in spite of the disorder and unrest\r\nwhich marked the military era, that era saw the birth of a great art\r\nmovement under the Ashikaga shogun, Yoshimasa. It has now to be noted\r\nthat this movement was rapidly developed under the Taiko. \"The latter\r\nit was whose practical genius did most to popularize art. Although\r\nhis early training and the occupations of his life until a late\r\nperiod were not calculated to educate esthetic taste, he devoted to\r\nthe cause of art a considerable portion of the sovereign power that\r\nhis great gifts as a military leader and a politician had brought\r\nhim.\" His earnest patronage of the tea ceremonial involved the\r\ncultivation of literature, and although he himself did not excel in\r\nthat line, he did much to promote the taste for it in others. In the\r\nfield of industrial art, however, his influence was much more marked.\r\nNot only did he bestow munificent allowances on skilled artists and\r\nart artisans, but also he conferred on them distinctions which proved\r\nstronger incentives than any pecuniary remuneration, and when he\r\nbuilt the celebrated mansions of Juraku and Momo-yama, so vast were\r\nthe sums that he lavished on their decoration, and such a certain\r\npassport to his favour did artistic merit confer, that the little\r\ntown of Fushimi quickly became the art capital of the empire, and\r\nmany of the most skilful painters, lacquerers, metal-workers, and\r\nwood-carvers within the Four Seas congregated there.\r\n\r\nHistorians speak with profound regret of the dismantling and\r\ndestruction of these splendid edifices a few years after the Taiko's\r\ndeath; but it is more than probable that the permanent possession of\r\neven such monuments of applied art could not have benefited the\r\ncountry nearly as much as did their destruction. For the immediate\r\nresult was an exodus of all the experts who, settling at Fushimi, had\r\nbecome famous for the sake of their Momo-yama work. They scattered\r\namong the fiefs of the most powerful provincial nobles, who received\r\nthem hospitably and granted them liberal revenues. From that time,\r\nnamely, the close of the sixteenth century, there sprang up an\r\ninter-fief rivalry of artistic production which materially promoted\r\nthe development of every branch of art and encouraged refinement of\r\nlife and manners. Not less noteworthy in the history of this military\r\nepoch is the improvement that took place in the social status of the\r\nmerchant during the sixteenth century. Much was due to the liberal\r\nviews of the Taiko. He encouraged commercial voyages by his\r\ncountrymen to Macao and to Cambodia, to Annam, and to other places.\r\nNine ships engaged in this trade every year. They carried licences\r\nbearing the Taiko's vermilion stamp, and the ports of departure were\r\nNagasaki, Osaka, and Sakai.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SIGNATURE OF TOKUGAWA IEYASU\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MOUNTAIN \"KAGO\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY IN JAPAN\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF JAPAN BY EUROPEANS\r\n\r\nTHE Portuguese discovered Japan in 1542 or 1543--the precise date is\r\nnot known. Three of them, travelling by junk from Spain to Macao,\r\nwere driven from their course and landed at Tanegashima, a small\r\nisland off the south of Kyushu. The strangers were hospitably\r\nreceived by the Japanese, and great interest was excited by their\r\narquebuses, the first firearms ever seen in Japan. It was, of course,\r\nout of the question to hold any oral direct conversation, but a\r\nChinese member of the junk's crew, by tracing ideographs upon the\r\nsand, explained the circumstances of the case. Ultimately, the junk\r\nwas piloted to a convenient port, and very soon the armourers of the\r\nlocal feudatory were busily engaged manufacturing arquebuses. News of\r\nthe discovery of Japan circulated quickly, and several expeditions\r\nwere fitted out by Portuguese settlements in the Orient to exploit\r\nthe new market. All steered for Kyushu, and thus the Island of the\r\nNine Provinces became the principal stage for European intercourse\r\nduring the second half of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nTHE JESUITS\r\n\r\nThere were, at that time, not a few Jesuits at Macao, Goa, and other\r\noutposts of Western commerce in the Far East. But not until 1549 was\r\nany attempt made to proselytize Japan. On August 15th of that year,\r\nFrancis Xavier, a Jesuit priest, landed at Kagoshima. Before his\r\ncoming, the Portuguese traders had penetrated as far as Kyoto, which\r\nthey reported to be a city of some ninety-six thousand houses, and\r\ntheir experience of the people had been very favourable, especially\r\nwith regard to receptivity of instruction. Xavier was weary of\r\nattempting to convert the Indians, whom he had found \"barbarous,\r\nvicious, and without inclination to virtue,\" and his mind had been\r\nturned towards Japan by a message from a Japanese daimyo (whose\r\nidentity and reasons for inviting him have never been explained), and\r\nby a personal appeal from a Japanese, whose name appears in\r\nPortuguese annals as \"Anjiro,\" and who, having committed a serious\r\ncrime in Japan, had taken refuge in a Portuguese vessel, whose master\r\nadvised him to repair to Malacca and confess his sins to Xavier.\r\n\r\nThis man, Anjiro, already possessed some knowledge of the Portuguese\r\nlanguage, and he soon became sufficiently proficient in it to act as\r\ninterpreter, thus constituting a valuable aid to the Portuguese\r\npropagandists. Xavier, with two fellow countrymen and Anjiro,\r\nrepaired to Kagoshima, where the Satsuma baron gave them unqualified\r\npermission to preach their doctrine. Not that he had any sympathy\r\nwith Christianity, about which he knew nothing, but solely because he\r\nwished to secure a share in the oversea commerce which had brought so\r\nmuch wealth to his fellow barons on the main island. He thought, in\r\nshort, that the Jesuits would be followed by merchant ships, and when\r\nPortuguese trading vessels did actually appear in the Satsuma waters,\r\nbut, instead of making any stay there, passed on to the comparatively\r\npetty principality of Hirado, Xavier and his comrades were quickly\r\nordered to leave Kagoshima. It seems, also, that Xavier's zeal had\r\noutrun his discretion. The Buddhist priests in Kagoshima were ready\r\nat first to listen respectfully to his doctrines, but were quickly\r\nalienated by his aggressive intolerance. They urged upon the Satsuma\r\nbaron the dangers that attended such propagandism, and he, already\r\nsmarting from commercial disappointment, issued an edict, in 1550,\r\ndeclaring it a capital offence to embrace Christianity. The edict was\r\nnot retrospective. About one hundred and fifty converts whom Xavier,\r\naided by Anjiro, had won during his two years' sojourn, were not\r\nmolested, but Xavier himself passed on to the island of Hirado, where\r\nhe was received by salvos of artillery from Portuguese vessels lying\r\nin harbour. Matsuura, the Hirado baron, had already been captivated\r\nby the commerce of the newcomers, and seeing the marked reverence\r\nextended by them to Xavier, the baron issued orders that respectful\r\nattention should be paid to the teaching of the foreign propagandist.\r\nDoubtless owing in large part to these orders, one hundred converts\r\nwere made during the first ten days of Xavier's residence in Hirado.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, evident that the attitude of the official classes\r\ntowards the new-comers was mainly influenced by the prospect of\r\ntrade, and that the attitude of the non-official classes towards the\r\nforeign religion depended largely on the mood of their superiors.\r\nXavier argued that \"if the favour of such a small prince was so\r\npotent for the conversion of his subjects, it would be quite another\r\nthing if he (Xavier) could have the protection of the Emperor.\" He\r\ntherefore, resolved to visit Kyoto. His journey took him in the first\r\nplace to Yamaguchi, capital of the Choshu fief. This town lay on the\r\nnorthern shore of Shimonoseki Strait, and had long been the principal\r\nemporium of trade with China and Korea. But the ruler of the fief,\r\nthough courteous to the new-comers, evinced no disposition to show\r\nany special cordiality towards humble missionaries unconnected with\r\ncommerce. Therefore, finding that their preaching produced little\r\neffect, Xavier and his companion, Fernandez, continued their journey\r\nto Kyoto, which they reached after travelling for nearly two months\r\non foot in the depth of winter. It happened, however, that the\r\ncapital was then suffering sharply from the effects of internecine\r\nstrife, and the two missionaries failed to obtain access to either\r\nthe sovereign or the shogun.\r\n\r\nNothing remained, therefore, but recourse to street preaching, and\r\nfor this they were ill equipped, for Xavier, constitutionally a bad\r\nlinguist, knew very little of the Japanese language, and his\r\ncompanion, Fernandez, even less, while as for Anjiro, he had remained\r\nin Kagoshima. After devoting a few days to this unproductive task,\r\nXavier returned to Yamaguchi. He had not made any converts in Kyoto,\r\nbut he had learned a useful lesson, namely, that religious\r\npropagandism, to be successful in Japan, must be countenanced by the\r\nruling classes. He therefore caused his canonicals to be sent to him\r\nfrom Hirado, together with his credentials from the viceroy of India,\r\nthe governor of Malacca, and the bishop of Goa. These documents he\r\nsubmitted to the Choshu baron, accompanying them with certain rare\r\nobjects of European manufacture, including a clock and a harpsicord.\r\nA permit to preach Christianity was now obtained without difficulty,\r\nand the Yamaguchi officials went so far as to issue a proclamation\r\nexpressing approval of the Western religion and granting entire\r\nliberty to embrace it. An empty Buddhist monastery was assigned as a\r\nresidence for Xavier and his companions, and the fact is certainly an\r\neloquent testimony to the magnanimity of the Buddhist priests.\r\n\r\nMany converts were now made, and fresh proof was obtained that the\r\nroad to success lay in associating propagandism with commerce. It was\r\nnearly a decade since the Portuguese had effected their first landing\r\non Tanegashima, and throughout that interval trade had flourished in\r\ntheir hands. They had not sought any new markets on the main island;\r\nfirst, because their ignorance of the coasts rendered navigation\r\nrisky; and, secondly, because internecine war raged throughout almost\r\nthe whole of the main island, whereas Kyushu enjoyed comparative\r\ntranquillity. Xavier now took advantage of a Portuguese vessel which\r\ncalled at Yamaguchi en route for Bungo, a province on the eastern\r\nlittoral of Kyushu. His intention was to return for a time to the\r\nIndies, but on reaching Bungo he learned that its ruler, Otomo,\r\nwielded exceptional power and showed a disposition to welcome the\r\nJesuit father.\r\n\r\nThis Otomo was destined ultimately to act a leading part on the stage\r\nof Christianity in Japan. Xavier now had recourse to methods\r\nsuggested by his recent experiences. On a visit to Otomo he caused\r\nhimself to be escorted by a large number of the Portuguese crew, who\r\nwore rich garments, carried arms, and flaunted banners. This\r\nprocedure seems to have weighed cogently with Otomo, who was keenly\r\ndesirous of attracting foreign traders and obtaining from them not\r\nonly wealth but also novel and effective weapons of war. Seeing that\r\nXavier was almost deified by the Portuguese, Otomo naturally applied\r\nhimself to win the good-will of the Jesuits, and for that purpose not\r\nonly accorded to them entire liberty to teach and to preach, but also\r\ndespatched a messenger to his younger brother (who had just succeeded\r\nto the lordship of Yamaguchi), advising him to protect the two\r\nJesuits then residing there, namely, Torres and Fernandez. Xavier\r\nremained four months in Bungo and then set sail for Goa in February,\r\n1552. He died in December of the same year, and thus his intention of\r\nreturning to Japan was defeated. His stay in Japan had lasted\r\ntwenty-seven months, and in that interval he and his comrades had won\r\nsome 760 converts.\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF PROPAGANDISM\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to recapitulate here the main events during this\r\nfirst epoch of Christian propagandism in Japan. It has been shown\r\nthat in more than a year's labours in Kagoshima, Xavier, with the\r\nassistance of Anjiro as an interpreter, obtained 150 believers. Now,\r\n\"no language lends itself with greater difficulty than Japanese to\r\nthe discussion of theological questions. The terms necessary for such\r\na purpose are not current among laymen, and only by special study,\r\nwhich, it need scarcely be said, must be preluded by accurate\r\nacquaintance with the tongue itself, can a man hope to become duly\r\nequipped for the task of exposition and dissertation. It is open to\r\ngrave doubt whether any foreigner has ever attained the requisite\r\nproficiency. Leaving Anjiro in Kagoshima, to care for the converts\r\nmade there, Xavier pushed on to Hirado, where he baptized a hundred\r\nJapanese in a few days. Now, we have it on the authority of Xavier\r\nhimself that, in this Hirado campaign, 'none of us knew Japanese.'\r\nHow, then, did they proceed? 'By reciting a semi-japanese volume' (a\r\ntranslation made by Anjiro of a treatise from Xavier's pen) 'and by\r\ndelivering sermons, we brought several over to the Christian cult.'\r\n\r\n\"Sermons preached in Portuguese or Latin to a Japanese audience on\r\nthe island of Hirado in the year 1550 can scarcely have attracted\r\nintelligent interest. On his first visit to Yamaguchi, Xavier's means\r\nof access to the understanding of his hearers was confined to the\r\nrudimentary knowledge of Japanese which Fernandez had been able to\r\nacquire in fourteen months, a period of study which, in modern times\r\nwith all the aids now procurable, would not suffice to carry a\r\nstudent beyond the margin of the colloquial. No converts were won.\r\nThe people of Yamaguchi probably admired the splendid faith and\r\ndevotion of these over-sea philosophers, but as for their doctrine,\r\nit was unintelligible. In Kyoto, the same experience was repeated\r\nwith an addition of much physical hardship. But, when the Jesuits\r\nreturned to Yamaguchi in the early autumn of 1551, they baptized five\r\nhundred persons, including several members of the military class.\r\nStill Fernandez with his broken Japanese was the only medium for\r\ncommunicating the profound doctrines of Christianity. It must be\r\nconcluded that the teachings of the missionaries produced much less\r\neffect than the attitude of the local chieftain.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nBut the Jesuits have not left any misgivings on record. They relate\r\nthat during Xavier's sojourn in Bungo he had numerous public\r\ndebates--one continuing for five days--with Buddhist priests, but\r\neven Fernandez not being available as an interpreter, these debates\r\nmust have been either farcical or imaginary, though brilliant results\r\nare claimed for them by the Church historians. That Xavier himself\r\nwas not satisfied is proved by his determination to transfer his\r\nministrations to China, for he said, \"if the Chinese adopt the\r\nChristian religion, the Japanese also will abandon the religions they\r\nhave introduced from China.\"\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD OF PROPAGANDISM\r\n\r\nTorres and Fernandez remained in Japan after Xavier's departure and\r\nwere there joined soon afterwards by three others. The new-comers\r\nlanded at Kagoshima and found that the Satsuma baron was as keen as\r\never in welcoming foreign trade, although his attitude towards the\r\nalien religion continued antipathetic. Bungo now became the\r\nheadquarters of the Jesuits in Japan. Local disturbances had\r\ncompelled them to leave Yamaguchi, where their disputes with Buddhist\r\npriests had become so violent that an official proscription of the\r\nWestern religion was pronounced. In Funai, the capital of the\r\nprovince of Bungo, they built their first church in Japan and also a\r\nhospital. From that place, too, they began to send yearly reports\r\nknown as the Annual Letters to their generals in Rome, and these\r\nLetters give an interesting insight into the conditions then existing\r\nin Japan. The writers \"describe a state of abject poverty among the\r\nlower orders--poverty so cruel that the destruction of children by\r\ntheir famishing parents was an every-day occurrence.\" This terrible\r\nstate of affairs was due to the civil wars which had entered their\r\nmost violent phase in the Onin era (1467-1468), and had continued\r\nwithout intermission ever since. The trade carried on by the\r\nPortuguese did not, however, suffer any interruption. Their vessels\r\nrepaired to Hirado as well as to Funai, and the masters and seamen of\r\nthe ships appear to have treated the missionaries with such\r\nscrupulous respect that the Japanese formed an almost exaggerated\r\nconception of the civil influence wielded by the religionists. It\r\nfurther appears that in those early days the Portuguese seamen\r\nrefrained from the riotous excesses which had already won for them a\r\nmost unenviable reputation in China.\r\n\r\nIn fact, their good conduct constituted an object lesson in the\r\ninterests of Christianity. We learn, incidentally that, in 1557, two\r\nof the fathers, visiting Hirado at the instance of some Portuguese\r\nsailors who felt in want of religious ministrations, organized a kind\r\nof propagandism which anticipated the methods of the Salvation Army.\r\nThey \"sent brothers to parade the streets, ringing bells, and\r\nchaunting litanies; they organized bands of boys for the same\r\npurpose; they caused the converts, and even children, to flagellate\r\nthemselves at a model of Mount Calvary, and they worked miracles,\r\nhealing the sick by contact with scourges or with a booklet in which\r\nXavier had written litanies and prayers. It may well be imagined that\r\nsuch doings attracted surprised attention in Japan. They were\r\nsupplemented by even more striking practices. For a sub-feudatory of\r\nthe Hirado chief, having been converted, showed his zeal by\r\ndestroying Buddhist temples and throwing down the idols, thus\r\ninaugurating a campaign of violence destined to mark the progress of\r\nChristianity throughout the greater part of its history in Japan.\r\nThere followed the overthrowing of a cross in the Christian cemetery,\r\nthe burning of a temple in the town of Hirado, and a street riot, the\r\nsequel being that the Jesuit fathers were compelled to return once\r\nmore to Bungo.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nAll this conveys an idea of the guise under which Christianity was\r\npresented originally to the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Portuguese\r\ntraders did not allow their commerce to be interrupted by any\r\nmisfortunes which overtook the Jesuits. Hirado continued to be\r\nfrequented by Portuguese merchantmen, and news of the value of their\r\ntrade induced Sumitada, feudatory of Omura, to invite the Jesuits in\r\nBungo to his fief, offering them a free port for ten years, an\r\nextensive tract of land, a residence for the missionaries, and other\r\nprivileges. This induced the Hirado feudatory to revoke the edict\r\nwhich he had issued against the Jesuits, and they were preparing to\r\ntake advantage of his renewed hospitality when a Portuguese\r\nmerchantman entered Hirado. Its appearance convinced the local\r\nchieftain that trade could be had without the accompaniment of\r\nreligion, towards which he renewed his hostility. When, however, this\r\nchange of demeanour was communicated to Funai, the Jesuit leader,\r\nTorres, hastened thence to Hirado, and induced the master of the\r\nmerchantman to leave the port on the ground that he could not remain\r\nin a country where they maltreated those who professed the same\r\nreligion as himself. Thereafter, for some years, Hirado remained\r\noutside the pale of foreign trade. But ultimately three merchant\r\nvessels appeared in the offing and announced their willingness to put\r\nin provided that the anti-Christian ban was removed. This\r\nremonstrance proved effective. A parallel case occurred a few years\r\nlater in the island of Amakusa. There a petty baron, avowedly for the\r\npurpose of attracting foreign trade, embraced Christianity and\r\nrequired all his vassals to follow his example. But when no\r\nPortuguese ship arrived, he apostatized; ordered his vassals to\r\nreturn to their old faith, and expelled the missionaries.\r\n\r\n\"In fact, the competition for the patronage of Portuguese traders was\r\nso keen that the Hirado feudatory attempted to burn several of their\r\nvessels because they frequented the territorial waters of his\r\nneighbour and rival, Sumitada. The latter became a most stalwart\r\nChristian when his wish was gratified. He set himself to eradicate\r\nidolatry throughout his fief with the strong arm, and his fierce\r\nintolerance provoked revolts which ended in the destruction of the\r\nChristian town at the newly opened free port. Sumitada, however,\r\nquickly reasserted his authority, and five years later (1567), he\r\ntook a step which had far-reaching consequences, namely, the building\r\nof a church at Nagasaki, in order that Portuguese commerce might have\r\na centre and the Christians an assured asylum. Nagasaki was then a\r\nlittle fishing village. In five years it grew to be a town of thirty\r\nthousand inhabitants, and Sumitada became one of the richest of the\r\nKyushu feudatories.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nThis baron appears to have been sincere in his adoption of the\r\nforeign religion. \"When in 1573, successful conflicts with\r\nneighbouring fiefs brought him an access of territory, he declared\r\nthat he owed these victories to the influence of the Christian God,\r\nand shortly afterwards he proclaimed banishment for all who would not\r\naccept the foreign faith. There were then no Jesuits by his side, but\r\nimmediately two hastened to join him, and 'these accompanied by a\r\nstrong guard, but yet not without danger of their lives, went round\r\ncausing the churches of the Gentiles, with their idols, to be thrown\r\ndown to the ground, while three Japanese Christians went preaching\r\nthe law of God everywhere.'\" They further record that three fathers\r\nwho were in the neighbouring fief \"all withdrew therefrom to work in\r\nthis abundant harvest, and in the space of seven months twenty\r\nthousand persons were baptized, including the bonzes of about sixty\r\nmonasteries.\"* The Jesuit vice-provincial (Francis Cabral), relating\r\nthese events, speaks with marked satisfaction of the abasement of the\r\nBuddhist priests, and adds, \"That these should now come to such a\r\nhumility that they throw themselves on the ground before two ragged\r\nmembers of the Company is one of the miracles worked by the Divine\r\nMajesty.\"\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nIn Funai things were by no means so satisfactory. The Jesuits, as\r\nstated above, had a hospital there, which had been built at the\r\ncharges of a devout Portuguese. But Francis Cabral, writing from\r\nBungo, in 1576, said: \"Down to this hour the Christians have been so\r\nabject and vile that they have shown no desire to acknowledge\r\nthemselves, partly from being few in the midst of so many Gentiles,\r\npartly because the said Christianity began in the hospital where we\r\ncure the people of low condition and those suffering from contagious\r\ndiseases, like the French evil and such others. Whence the Gospel\r\ncame to be of such little reputation that no man of position would\r\ndare to accept it (although it seemed good and true to him) merely\r\nlest he should be confounded with this rabble (con quella plebe). And\r\nalthough we gave much edification with such works, the thing\r\nnevertheless was a great obstacle to the spread of the holy faith.\r\nAnd thus, during the twenty years we have had a residence in Funai,\r\none gentleman became a Christian, and this after having been cured of\r\nthe said evil in his house; but as soon as he was cured he afterwards\r\nthought it shame to acknowledge his Christianity in the presence of\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nThis most disheartening record underwent a complete change in 1576,\r\nwhen the son of the Bungo feudatory, a youth of some sixteen years,\r\nand, two years later, the feudatory himself, Otomo, embraced the\r\nChristian faith. In the first Annual Letter sent to Rome after these\r\nevents a striking admission is made: \"It is Otomo, next to God, whom\r\nthe Jesuits have to thank for their success in Japan.\" This\r\nappreciation looks somewhat exaggerated when placed side by side with\r\nthe incidents that occurred in Sumitada's fief, as related above.\r\nNevertheless, Otomo certainly did render powerful aid, not within his\r\nown fief alone but also through his influence elsewhere. Thus, he did\r\nnot hesitate to have recourse to arms in order to obtain for the\r\nJesuits access to the island of Amakusa, where one of the local\r\nbarons, tempted originally by tradal prospects and afterwards urged\r\nby his wife, called upon his vassals to choose between conversion or\r\nexile, and issued an order that any Buddhist priests refusing to\r\naccept Christianity would have their property confiscated and their\r\npersons banished.\r\n\r\nPractically the whole population became converts under the pressure\r\nof these edicts, and it is thus seen that Christianity owed much of\r\nits success in Kyushu to methods which recall Islam and the\r\nInquisition. Another illustration of this is furnished by the Arima\r\nfief, which adjoined that of Omura where Sumitada ruled. The heads of\r\nthese two fiefs were brothers, and thus when Sumitada embraced\r\nChristianity the Jesuits received an invitation to visit Arima at the\r\nports of Kuchinotsu and Shimabara, where from that time Portuguese\r\nships repaired frequently. In 1576, the Arima baron, seeing the\r\nprosperity and power which had followed the conversion of his brother\r\nSumitada, accepted baptism and became the \"Prince Andrew\" of\r\nmissionary records. In those records we read that \"the first thing\r\nPrince Andrew did after his baptism was to convert the chief temple\r\nof his capital into a church, its revenues being assigned for the\r\nmaintenance of the building and the support of the missionaries. He\r\nthen took measures to have the same thing done in the other towns of\r\nhis fief, and he seconded the preachers of the Gospel so well in\r\neverything else that he could flatter himself that he soon would not\r\nhave one single idolater in his states.\" This fanatical \"Prince\r\nAndrew\" survived his baptism by two years only, but during that time\r\ntwenty thousand converts were made in Arima. His successor, however,\r\nwas a believer in Buddhism. He caused the Christian churches to be\r\ndestroyed and the crosses to be thrown down; he ordered the Jesuits\r\nto quit his dominions, and he required the converts to return to\r\nBuddhism. Under this pressure about one-half of the converts\r\napostatized, but the rest threatened to leave Kuchinotsu en masse.\r\nHowever this would have meant the loss of foreign trade, and as a\r\nresult of this circumstance the anti-Christian edicts were radically\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nJust at that time, also, a fortunate incident occurred. It had become\r\nthe custom for a large vessel from Macao to visit Japan every year,\r\nand the advent of this ship had great importance from a commercial\r\npoint of view. It chanced that she made the port of Kuchinotsu her\r\nplace of call in 1578, and her presence suggested such a pleasing\r\noutcome that the feudatory embraced Christianity and allowed his\r\nvassals to do the same. By this \"great ship from Macao\" the Jesuit\r\nvice-general, Valegnani was a passenger. A statesman as well as a\r\npreacher, this astute politician made such a clever use of the\r\nopportunity that, in 1580, \"all the city was made Christian, and the\r\npeople burned their idols and destroyed forty temples, reserving some\r\nmaterials to build churches.\"\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF THE FIRST THREE DECADES OF PROPAGANDISM\r\n\r\nThe record achieved by the Christian propagandists up to this time\r\nwas distinctly satisfactory. In the Annual Letter of 1582 we find it\r\nstated that, at the close of 1581, that is to say, thirty-two years\r\nafter Xavier's landing in Japan there were about 150,000 converts. Of\r\nthese some 125,000 were in Kyushu; the remainder in Yamaguchi, Kyoto,\r\nand the vicinity of the latter city. As for the Jesuits in Japan,\r\nthey then numbered seventy-five, but down to the year 1563 there had\r\nnever been more than nine. \"The harvest was certainly great in\r\nproportion to the number of sowers. But it was a harvest mainly of\r\nartificial growth, forced by despotic insistence of feudal chiefs who\r\npossessed the power of life and death over their vassals, and were\r\ninfluenced by a desire to attract foreign trade.\"\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\n\"To the Buddhist priests this movement of Christian propagandism had\r\nbrought an experience hitherto almost unknown in Japan--persecution\r\nsolely on account of creed. They had suffered for interfering in\r\npolitics, but the cruel vehemence of the Christian fanatic may be\r\nsaid to have now become known for the first time to men themselves\r\nusually conspicuous for tolerance of heresy and for receptivity of\r\ninstruction. They had had little previous experience of humanity in\r\nthe garb of an Otomo of Bungo, who, in the words of Crasset, Svent to\r\nthe chase of the bonzes as to that of wild beasts, and made it his\r\nsingular pleasure to exterminate them from his states.'\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by Brinkley.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE EMBASSY TO EUROPE\r\n\r\nAnother important result of the coming of Valegnani to Japan was\r\nthat, in 1582, an embassy sailed from Nagasaki for Europe. It\r\nconsisted of four young men, representing the fiefs of Arima, Omura,\r\nand Bungo, and it is related that at Lisbon, Madrid, and Rome they\r\nwere received with an elaborate show of dazzling magnificence, so\r\nthat they carried back to their island home a vivid impression of the\r\nmight and wealth of Western countries.\r\n\r\nKYOTO AND CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the visit to Kyoto by Xavier and\r\nFernandez was wholly unsuccessful. Such was not the case, however,\r\nwhen another visit was made to the same city by Vilela, in the year\r\n1559. This eminent missionary had been invited to Kyoto by the abbot\r\nof the celebrated Buddhist monastery of Hiei-zan, who desired to\r\ninvestigate the Christian doctrine. It is to be noted that, at this\r\ntime, Christian propagandism in Kyushu had not yet begun to be\r\ndisfigured by acts of violence. Vilela carried letters of\r\nintroduction from the Bungo feudatory, but before he reached the\r\ncapital the Buddhist abbot of Hiei-zan had died, and his successor\r\ndid not show the same liberal spirit of inquiry. Still, Vilela was\r\npermitted to expound his doctrines in the presence of a gathering of\r\npriests in the great monastery, and afterwards the good offices of\r\none of these bonzes, supplemented by the letter of the Bungo\r\nfeudatory, procured for the Jesuit father the honour of being\r\nreceived by the shogun, Yoshiteru, who treated him with much\r\nconsideration and assigned a house for his residence.\r\n\r\nVilela does not seem to have allowed himself to be influenced in any\r\ndegree by the aid that he received on this occasion from his Buddhist\r\nfriend, who is described as \"one of the most respected men in the\r\ncity.\" The Jesuit father seized the first opportunity to denounce\r\nBuddhism and its followers in unmeasured terms, and soon the bonzes\r\nbegan to intrigue with corresponding vehemence for the expulsion of\r\nthe foreign propagandists. But the shogun extended his protection to\r\nVilela, by issuing a decree which made it a capital punishment to\r\ninjure the missionaries or obstruct their work. The times, however,\r\nwere very troublous, so that Vilela and his fellow workers had to\r\nencounter much difficulty and no little danger. Nothing, however,\r\ndamped their ardour, and five years after their arrival in Kyoto they\r\nhad not only obtained many converts but had organized churches in\r\nfive towns within a radius of fifty miles from the capital. Two\r\nincidents may be specially mentioned illustrating the loyal spirit\r\nwith which the Japanese of that time approached controversy. Among\r\nVilela's converts were two Buddhist priests who had been nominated\r\nofficially to investigate and report upon the novel doctrines, and\r\nwho, in the sequel of their investigation, openly embraced\r\nChristianity though they had originally been vehemently opposed to\r\nit. The second incident was the conversion of a petty feudatory,\r\nTakayama, whose fief lay at Takatsuki in the vicinity of the capital.\r\nHe challenged Vilela to a public discussion of the merits of the two\r\ncreeds, and being vanquished, he frankly acknowledged his defeat,\r\nadopted Christianity, and invited his vassals as well as his family\r\nto follow his example. His son, Yusho, became one of the most loyal\r\nsupporters of Christianity in all Japan. He is the \"Don Justo\r\nUkondono\" of the Jesuits' annals.\r\n\r\nNOBUNAGA AND CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nAt the time of Vilela's visit to Kyoto civil war was raging. It led\r\nto the death of the shogun, Yoshiteru, and to the issue of an\r\nImperial decree proscribing Christianity, Vilela and his two comrades\r\nwere obliged to take refuge in the town of Sakai, and they remained\r\nthere during three years, when they were invited to an interview with\r\nOda Nobunaga, who, at this time, had risen almost to the pinnacle of\r\nhis immense power. Had Nobunaga shown himself hostile to\r\nChristianity, the latter's fate in Japan would have been quickly\r\nsealed; but not only was he a man of wide and liberal views, but also\r\nhe harboured a strong antipathy against the Buddhists, whose armed\r\ninterference in politics had caused him much embarrassment. He\r\nwelcomed Christianity largely as an opponent of Buddhism, and when\r\nTakayama conducted Froez from Sakai to Nobunaga's presence, the\r\nJesuit received a cordial welcome. Thenceforth, during the fourteen\r\nremaining years of his life, Nobunaga steadily befriended the\r\nmissionaries in particular and foreign visitors to Japan in general.\r\nHe stood between the Jesuits and the Throne when, in reply to an\r\nappeal from Buddhist priests, the Emperor Okimachi, for the second\r\ntime, issued an anti-Christian decree (1568); he granted a site for a\r\nchurch and a residence at Azuchi on Lake Biwa, where his new castle\r\nstood; he addressed to various powerful feudatories letters\r\nsignifying a desire for the spread of Christianity; he frequently\r\nmade handsome presents to the fathers, and whenever they visited him\r\nhe showed himself accessible and gracious. The Jesuits said of him:\r\n\"This man seems to have been chosen by God to open and prepare the\r\nway for our faith. In proportion to the intensity of his enmity to\r\nthe bonzes and their sects is his good-will towards our fathers who\r\npreach the law of God, whence he has shown them so many favours that\r\nhis subjects are amazed and unable to divine what he is aiming at in\r\nthis. I will only say that, humanly speaking, what has above all\r\ngiven great credit and reputation to the fathers is the great favour\r\nNobunaga has shown for the Company.\" It is not to be supposed,\r\nhowever, that Nobunaga's attitude towards the Jesuits signified any\r\nbelief in their doctrines. In 1579, he took a step which showed\r\nplainly that policy as a statesman ranked much higher in his\r\nestimation than duty towards religion. For, in order to ensure the\r\narmed assistance of a certain feudatory, a professing Christian,\r\nNobunaga seized the Jesuits in Kyoto, and threatened to ban their\r\nreligion altogether unless they persuaded the feudatory to adopt\r\nNobunaga's side. Nevertheless, that Christianity benefited much by\r\nhis patronage there can be no dissentient opinion.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI AND CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nAfter Nobunaga's death, in 1582, the supreme power fell into the\r\nhands of Hideyoshi, and had he chosen to exercise it, he could have\r\neasily undone the whole work hitherto achieved by the Jesuits at the\r\ncost of much effort and devotion. But, at first, Hideyoshi followed\r\nNobunaga's example. He not only accorded a friendly audience to\r\nFather Organtino, as representative of the fathers, but also he went\r\nin person to assign to the Company a site for a church and a\r\nresidence in Osaka. At this time, \"many Christian converts were\r\nserving in high positions, and in 1584, the Jesuits placed it on\r\nrecord that 'Hideyoshi was not only not opposed to the things of God,\r\nbut he even showed that he made much account of them (the fathers)\r\nand preferred them to all the sects of the bonzes. . . He is\r\nentrusting to Christians his treasures, his secrets, and his\r\nfortresses of most importance, and he shows himself well pleased that\r\nthe sons of the great lords about him should adopt our customs and\r\nour law.' Two years later in Osaka he received with every mark of\r\ncordiality and favour a Jesuit mission which had come from Nagasaki\r\nseeking audience, and on that occasion his visitors recorded that he\r\nspoke of an intention of christianizing one half of Japan.\" Nor did\r\nhe confine himself to licensing the missionaries to preach throughout\r\nall Japan: he exempted not only churches from the billeting of\r\nsoldiers but also the priests themselves from local burdens.\r\n\r\n\"This was in 1586, on the eve of his great military enterprise, the\r\ninvasion of Kyushu. . . He carried that difficult campaign to\r\ncompletion by the middle of 1587, and throughout its course he\r\nmaintained a uniformly friendly demeanour toward the Jesuits. But\r\nsuddenly, when on the return journey he reached Hakata in the north\r\nof the island, his policy underwent a radical metamorphosis. Five\r\nquestions were by his orders propounded to the vice-provincial of the\r\nJesuits: 'Why and by what authority he and his fellow propagandists\r\nhad constrained Japanese subjects to become Christians? Why they had\r\ninduced their disciples and their sectaries to overthrow temples? Why\r\nthey persecuted the bonzes? Why they and other Portuguese ate animals\r\nuseful to men, such as oxen and cows? Why the vice-provincial allowed\r\nmerchants of his nation to buy Japanese and make slaves of them in\r\nthe Indies?' To these queries Coelho, the vice-provincial, made\r\nanswer that the missionaries had never themselves resorted, or\r\nincited, to violence in their propagandism, or persecuted bonzes;\r\nthat if their eating of beef was considered inadvisable, they would\r\ngive up the practice, and that they were powerless to prevent or\r\nrestrain the outrages perpetrated by their countrymen. Hideyoshi read\r\nthe vice-provincial's reply and, without comment, sent him word to\r\nretire to Hirado, assemble all his followers there, and quit the\r\ncountry within six months. On the next day (July 25, 1587) the\r\nfollowing edict was published:\r\n\r\n'Having learned from our faithful councillors that foreign priests\r\nhave come into our estates, where they preach a law contrary to that\r\nof Japan, and that they have even had the audacity to destroy temples\r\ndedicated to our Kami and Hotoke; although the outrage merits the\r\nmost extreme punishment, wishing nevertheless to show them mercy, we\r\norder them under pain of death to quit Japan within twenty days.\r\nDuring that space no harm or hurt will be done, to them. But at the\r\nexpiration of that term, we order that if any of them be found in our\r\nestates, they should be seized and punished as the greatest\r\ncriminals. As for the Portuguese merchants, we permit them to enter\r\nour ports, there to continue their accustomed trade, and to remain in\r\nour estates provided our affairs need this. But we forbid them to\r\nbring any foreign priests into the country, under the penalty of the\r\nconfiscation of their ships and goods.'\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nHow are we to account for this seemingly rapid change of mood on\r\nHideyoshi's part? A comparison of dates furnishes some assistance in\r\nreplying to that question. The Kyushu campaign took place in 1587,\r\nand it was in 1586 that Hideyoshi commenced the construction of the\r\ncolossal image of Buddha in Kyoto. The Taiko was by no means a\r\nreligious man. That is amply shown by the stories told in the\r\nprevious pages. But his political sagacity taught him that to\r\ncontinue Nobunaga's crusade against Buddhism would not be wise\r\nstatesmanship, and that if the bonzes could be disarmed and diverted\r\nfrom military pursuits, they would become useful agents of\r\nintellectual and moral progress. His idea of setting up a gigantic\r\nidol in the capital marked his final substitution of a conciliatory\r\nprogramme for the fiercely destructive methods of Nobunaga. Of\r\nnecessity he had, then, to reconsider his demeanour towards\r\nChristianity, and it is on record that before leaving Osaka for\r\nKyushu he publicly stated, \"I fear much that all the virtue of the\r\nEuropean priests is merely a mask of hypocrisy and serves only to\r\nconceal pernicious designs against the empire.\" Then, in Kyushu, two\r\nthings influenced him strongly. One was that he now saw with his own\r\neyes what militant Christianity really meant--ruined temples,\r\noverthrown idols, and coerced converts. Such excesses had not\r\ndisgraced Christian propagandism in Kyoto or in the metropolitan\r\nprovinces, but in Kyushu the unsightly story was forced upon\r\nHideyoshi's attention. The second special feature of the situation in\r\nKyushu was that relations of an altogether exceptional character were\r\nestablished between Hideyoshi and Kennyo, abbot of the Shin sect. By\r\nthe contrivance of that prelate, Hideyoshi's troops were enabled to\r\nfollow a secret road to the stronghold of the Satsuma baron, and in\r\nreturn for such valuable services Hideyoshi may well have been\r\npersuaded to proscribe Christianity.\r\n\r\nSome importance, though probably of a less degree, attaches also to\r\nthe last of the five questions propounded by Hideyoshi to the\r\nvice-provincial--why the priests allowed merchants of their nation to\r\nbuy Japanese subjects and carry them into slavery in the Indies. It\r\nwas in Kyushu only that these abuses were perpetrated. With respect\r\nto this matter the following passage appears in the archives of the\r\nAcademy of History at Madrid: \"Even the Lascars and scullions of the\r\nPortuguese purchase and carry slaves away. Hence it happens that many\r\nof them die on the voyage, because they are heaped up one upon the\r\nother, and if their master fall sick (these masters are sometimes\r\nKaffirs and the negroes of the Portuguese), the slaves are not cared\r\nfor. It even often happens that the Kaffirs cannot procure the\r\nnecessary food for them. I here omit the excesses committed in the\r\nlands of pagans where the Portuguese spread themselves to recruit\r\nyouth and girls, and where they live in such a fashion that the\r\npagans themselves are stupefied at it.\" Nevertheless, the fact that\r\nthe Taiko specially exempted the Portuguese merchants from his decree\r\nof banishment indicates that he did not attach cardinal importance to\r\ntheir evil doings in the matter of slaves. It seems rather to have\r\nbeen against the Jesuits that his resentment was directed, for he did\r\nnot fail to perceive that, whereas they could and did exact the\r\nutmost deference from their country's sailors and traders when the\r\nends of Christian propagandism were served thereby, they professed\r\nthemselves powerless to dissuade these same traders and sailors from\r\noutrages which would have disgraced any religion. He cannot but have\r\nconcluded that if these Portuguese merchants and seamen were to be\r\nregarded as specimens of the products of Christianity, then, indeed,\r\nthat creed had not much to recommend it. All these things seem amply\r\nsufficient to account for the change that manifested itself in\r\nHideyoshi's attitude towards Christianity at the close of the Kyushu\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL OF THE EDICT OF BANISHMENT\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, of whom it must be said that they never consulted their\r\nown safety when the cause of their faith could be advanced by\r\nself-sacrifice, paid no attention to the Taiko's edict. They did\r\nindeed assemble at Hirado to the number of 120, but when they\r\nreceived orders to embark at once, they decided that only those\r\nneeded for service in China should leave Japan. The rest remained and\r\ncontinued to perform their religious duties as usual, under the\r\nprotection of the converted feudatories. The latter also appear to\r\nhave concluded that it was not necessary to follow Hideyoshi's\r\ninjunctions strictly concerning the expulsion of the priests. It\r\nseemed, at first, as though nothing short of extermination was\r\ncontemplated by the Taiko. He caused all the churches in Kyoto,\r\nOsaka, and Sakai to be pulled down, and he sent troops to raze the\r\nChristian places of worship in Kyushu. But the troops accepted gifts\r\noffered to them by the feudatories and left the churches standing,\r\nwhile Hideyoshi not only failed to enforce his edict, but also\r\nallowed himself in the following year, 1588, to be convinced by a\r\nPortuguese envoy that unless the missionaries were suffered to\r\nremain, oversea trade could not possibly be carried on in a peaceful\r\nand orderly manner. For the sake of that trade, Hideyoshi agreed to\r\ntolerate the Christian propagandists, and, for a time, the foreign\r\nfaith continued to flourish in Kyushu and found a favourable field\r\neven in Kyoto.\r\n\r\nAt this time, in response to a message from the Jesuits, the viceroy\r\nof the Indies sent an ambassador to thank Hideyoshi for the favours\r\nhe had hitherto bestowed upon the missionaries, and in the train of\r\nthis nominally secular embassy came a number of fresh Jesuits to\r\nlabour in the Japanese field. The ambassador was Valegnani, a man of\r\nprofound tact. Acting upon the Taiko's unequivocal hints, Valegnani\r\ncaused the missionaries to divest their work of all ostentatious\r\nfeatures and to comport themselves with the utmost circumspection, so\r\nthat official attention should not be attracted by any salient\r\nevidences of Christian propagandism. Indeed, at this very time, as\r\nstated above, Hideyoshi took a step which plainly showed that he\r\nvalued the continuance of trade much more highly than the extirpation\r\nof Christianity. \"Being assured that Portuguese merchants could not\r\nfrequent Japan unless they found Christian priests there, he\r\nconsented to sanction the presence of a limited number of Jesuits,\"\r\nthough he was far too shrewd to imagine that their services could be\r\nlimited to men of their own nationality, and too clever to forget\r\nthat these very Portuguese, who professed to attach so much\r\nimportance to religious ministrations, were the same men whose\r\nflagrant outrages the fathers declared themselves powerless to check.\r\nIf any further evidence were needed of Hideyoshi's discrimination\r\nbetween trade and religion, it is furnished by his despatches to the\r\nviceroy of the Indies written in 1591:--\r\n\r\nThe fathers of the Company, as they are called, have come to these\r\nislands to teach another religion here; but as that of the Kami is\r\ntoo surely founded to be abolished, this new law can serve only to\r\nintroduce into Japan a diversity of cults prejudicial to the welfare\r\nof the State. It is for this reason that, by Imperial edict, I have\r\nforbidden these foreign doctors to continue to preach their doctrine.\r\nI have even ordered them to quit Japan, and I am resolved no longer\r\nto allow any one of them to come here to spread new opinions. I\r\nnevertheless desire that trade between you and us should always be on\r\nthe same footing [as before]. I shall have every care that the ways\r\nare free by sea and land: I have freed them from all pirates and\r\nbrigands. The Portuguese will be able to traffic with my subjects,\r\nand I will in no wise suffer any one to do them the least wrong.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of 1595 showed that there were then in Japan 137\r\nJesuit fathers with 300,000 native converts, including seventeen\r\nfeudal chiefs and not a few bonzes.\r\n\r\nHIDEYOSHI'S FINAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nFor ten years after the issue of his anti-Christian decree at Hakata,\r\nHideyoshi maintained a tolerant demeanour. But in 1597, his\r\nforbearance was changed to a mood of uncompromising severity. Various\r\nexplanations have been given of this change, but the reasons are\r\nobscure. \"Up to 1593 the Portuguese had possessed a monopoly of\r\nreligious propagandism and oversea commerce in Japan. The privilege\r\nwas secured to them by agreement between Spain and Portugal and by a\r\npapal bull. But the Spaniards in Manila had long looked with somewhat\r\njealous eyes on this Jesuit reservation, and when news of the\r\nanti-Christian decree of 1587 reached the Philippines, the Dominicans\r\nand Franciscans residing there were fired with zeal to enter an arena\r\nwhere the crown of martyrdom seemed to be the least reward within\r\nreach. The papal bull, however, demanded obedience, and to overcome\r\nthat difficulty a ruse was necessary: the governor of Manila agreed\r\nto send a party of Franciscans as ambassadors to Hideyoshi. In that\r\nguise, the friars, being neither traders nor propagandists,\r\nconsidered that they did not violate either the treaty or the bull.\r\nIt was a technical subterfuge very unworthy of the object\r\ncontemplated, and the friars supplemented it by swearing to Hideyoshi\r\nthat the Philippines would submit to his sway. Thus they obtained\r\npermission to visit Kyoto, Osaka, and Fushimi, but with the explicit\r\nproviso that they must not preach.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nHow far they observed the terms and the spirit of this arrangement\r\nmay be gathered from the facts that \"very soon they had built a\r\nchurch in Kyoto, consecrated it with the utmost pomp, and were\r\npreaching sermons and chaunting litanies there in flagrant defiance\r\nof Hideyoshi's veto. Presently, their number received an access of\r\nthree friars who came bearing gifts from the governor of Manila, and\r\nnow they not only established a convent in Osaka, but also seized a\r\nJesuit church in Nagasaki and converted the circumspect worship\r\nhitherto conducted there by the fathers into services of the most\r\npublic character. Officially checked in Nagasaki, they charged the\r\nJesuits in Kyoto with having intrigued to impede them, and they\r\nfurther vaunted the courageous openness of their own ministrations as\r\ncompared with the clandestine timidity of the methods which wise\r\nprudence had induced the Jesuits to adopt. Retribution would have\r\nfollowed quickly had not Hideyoshi's attention been engrossed by an\r\nattempt to invade China through Korea. At this stage, however, a\r\nmemorable incident occurred. Driven out of her course by a storm, a\r\ngreat and richly laden Spanish galleon, bound for Acapulco from\r\nManila, drifted to the coast of Tosa province, and running--or being\r\npurposely run--on a sand-bank as she was towed into port by Japanese\r\nboats, broke her back. She carried goods to the value of some six\r\nhundred thousand crowns, and certain officials urged Hideyoshi to\r\nconfiscate her as derelict, conveying to him, at the same time, a\r\ndetailed account of the doings of the Franciscans and their open\r\nflouting of his orders. Hideyoshi, much incensed, commanded the\r\narrest of the Franciscans and despatched officers to Tosa to\r\nconfiscate the San Felipe. The pilot of the galleon sought to\r\nintimidate these officers by showing them, on a map of the world, the\r\nvast extent of Spain's dominions, and being asked how one country had\r\nacquired such wide sway, replied,* 'Our kings begin by sending into\r\nthe countries they wish to conquer missionaries who induce the people\r\nto embrace our religion, and when they have made considerable\r\nprogress, troops are sent who combine with the new Christians, and\r\nthen our kings have not much trouble in accomplishing the rest.'\"**\r\n\r\n*Charlevoix, referring to this incident, says, \"This unfortunate\r\nstatement inflicted a wound on religion which is bleeding still after\r\na century and a half.\"\r\n\r\n**Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CHRISTIAN MARTYRS IN JAPAN\r\n\r\nThe words of the San Felipe's master were immediately reported to\r\nHideyoshi. They roused him to hot anger. He is reported to have\r\ncried: \"What! my States are filled with traitors, and their numbers\r\nincrease every day. I have proscribed the foreign doctors, but out of\r\ncompassion for the age and infirmity of some among them, I have\r\nallowed their remaining in Japan. I shut my eyes to the presence of\r\nseveral others because I fancied them to be quiet and incapable of\r\nforming bad designs, and they are serpents I have been cherishing in\r\nmy bosom. The traitors are entirely employed in making me enemies\r\namong my own subjects and perhaps in my own family. But they will\r\nlearn what it is to play with me... I am not anxious for myself. So\r\nlong as the breath of life remains, I defy all the powers of the\r\nearth to attack me. But I am perhaps to leave the empire to a child,\r\nand how can he maintain himself against so many foes, domestic and\r\nforeign, if I do not provide for everything incessantly?\"\r\n\r\nThen, finally, the Franciscans were arrested and condemned to have\r\ntheir noses and ears cut off;* to be promenaded through Kyoto, Osaka,\r\nand Sakai, and to be crucified at Nagasaki. \"I have ordered these\r\nforeigners to be treated thus,\" Hideyoshi is recorded to have stated,\r\n\"because they have come from the Philippines to Japan, calling\r\nthemselves ambassadors, although they were not so; because they have\r\nremained here for long without my permission; because in defiance of\r\nmy prohibition they have built churches, preached their religion, and\r\ncaused disorders.\" These men were the first martyrs in Japan.\r\n\r\n*The mutilation was confined to the lobe of one ear.\r\n\r\nThey numbered twenty-six, namely, six Franciscans, three Jesuits, and\r\nseventeen native Christians who were chiefly domestic servants of the\r\nFranciscans. They met their fate with noble fortitude. Hideyoshi did\r\nnot stop there. He took measures to have his edict of 1587 converted\r\ninto a stern reality. The governor of Nagasaki received orders to\r\nsend away all the Jesuits, permitting only two or three to remain for\r\nthe service of Portuguese merchants.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, however, were not to be deterred by personal peril.\r\nThere were 125 of them in Japan at that time, and of these only\r\neleven left Nagasaki by sea in October, 1597, though the same vessel\r\ncarried a number of pretended Jesuits who were, in reality, disguised\r\nsailors. This deception was necessarily known to the local\r\nauthorities; but their sympathies being with the Jesuits, they kept\r\nsilence until early the following year, when, owing to a rumour that\r\nHideyoshi himself contemplated a visit to Kyushu, they took really\r\nefficient measures to expel all the fathers. No less than 137\r\nchurches throughout Kyushu were thrown down, as well as several\r\nseminaries and residences of the fathers, and, at Nagasaki, all the\r\nJesuits in Japan were assembled for deportation to Macao in the\r\nfollowing year when the \"great ship\" was expected to visit that port.\r\nBut before her arrival Hideyoshi died, and a respite was thus gained\r\nfor the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN POLICY OF THE TOKUGAWA FAMILY\r\n\r\nIt has been confidently stated that Tokugawa Ieyasu regarded\r\nChristian nations and Christian propagandists with distrust not less\r\nprofound than that harboured by Hideyoshi. But facts are opposed to\r\nthat view. Within less than three months of the Taiko's death, the\r\nTokugawa chief had his first interview with a Christian priest. The\r\nman was a Franciscan, by name Jerome de Jesus. He had been a member\r\nof the fictitious embassy from Manila, and his story illustrates the\r\nzeal and courage that inspired the Christian fathers in those days.\r\n\"Barely escaping the doom of crucifixion which overtook his\r\ncompanions, he had been deported from Japan to Manila at a time when\r\ndeath seem to be the certain penalty of remaining. But no sooner had\r\nhe been landed in Manila than he took passage in a Chinese junk, and,\r\nreturning to Nagasaki, made his way secretly from the far south of\r\nJapan to the province of Kii. There arrested, he was brought into the\r\npresence of Ieyasu, and his own record of what ensued is given in a\r\nletter subsequently sent to Manila:\r\n\r\n\"'When the Prince saw me he asked how I managed to escape the previous\r\npersecution. I answered him that at that date God had delivered me in\r\norder that I might go to Manila and bring back new colleagues from\r\nthere--preachers of the divine law--and that I had returned from\r\nManila to encourage the Christians, cherishing the desire to die on\r\nthe cross in order to go to enjoy eternal glory like my former\r\ncolleagues. On hearing these words the Emperor began to smile,\r\nwhether in his quality of a pagan of the sect of Shaka which teaches\r\nthat there is no future life, or whether from the thought that I was\r\nfrightened at having to be put to death. Then, looking at me kindly,\r\nhe said, \"Be no longer afraid and no longer conceal yourself and no\r\nlonger change your habit, for I wish you well; and as for the\r\nChristians who every year pass within sight of Kwanto where my\r\ndomains are, when they go to Mexico with their ships, I have a keen\r\ndesire for them to visit the harbours of this island, to refresh\r\nthemselves there, and to take what they wish, to trade with my\r\nvassals, and to teach them how to develop silver mines; and that my\r\nintentions may be accomplished before my death, I wish you to\r\nindicate to me the means to take to realize them.\"\r\n\r\n\"'I answered that it was necessary that Spanish pilots should take the\r\nsoundings of his harbours, so that ships might not be lost in future\r\nas the San Felipe had been, and that he should solicit this service\r\nfrom the governor of the Philippines. The Prince approved of my\r\nadvice, and accordingly he has sent a Japanese gentleman, a native of\r\nSakai, the bearer of this message.... It is essential to oppose no\r\nobstacle to the complete liberty offered by the Emperor to the\r\nSpaniards and to our holy order, for the preaching of the holy\r\ngospel. ... The same Prince (who is about to visit the Kwanto)\r\ninvites me to accompany him to make choice of a house, and to visit\r\nthe harbour which he promises to open to us; his desires in this\r\nrespect are keener than I can express.'\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nSubsequent events confirm the accuracy of the above story. Father\r\nJerome was allowed to build the first Christian church in Yedo and to\r\nofficiate there. Moreover, Ieyasu sent \"three embassies in succession\r\nto the Philippines, proposing reciprocal freedom of commerce,\r\noffering to open ports in the Kwanto, and asking for competent naval\r\narchitects.\" These architects never came, and the trade that resulted\r\nfrom the Tokugawa chief's overtures was paltry in comparison with the\r\nnumber of friars that accompanied it to Japan. It has been suggested\r\nthat Ieyasu designed these Spanish monks to serve as a counterpoise\r\nto the influence of the Jesuits. For he must have known that the\r\nFranciscans opened their mission in Yedo by \"declaiming with violence\r\nagainst the fathers of the Company of Jesus,\" and he must have\r\nunderstood that the Spanish monks assumed towards the Jesuits in\r\nJapan the same intolerent and abusive tone that the Jesuits\r\nthemselves had previously assumed towards Buddhism.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ANJIN-ZUKA, NEAR YOKOSUKA, THE TOMB OF WILL ADAMS\r\n\r\nWILL ADAMS\r\n\r\nAt about this time a Dutch merchant ship named the Liefde arrived in\r\nJapan. In 1598, a squadron of five ships sailed from Holland to\r\nexploit the sources of Portuguese commerce in the Orient, and of the\r\nfive vessels only one, the Liefde, was ever heard of again. She\r\nreached Japan in the spring of 1600, with only four and twenty\r\nsurvivors of her original crew, numbering 110. Towed into the harbour\r\nof Funai, she was visited by Jesuits, who, on discovering her\r\nnationality, denounced her to the local authorities as a pirate. On\r\nboard the Liefde, serving in the capacity of pilot major was an\r\nEnglishman, Will Adams, of Gillingham in Kent. Ieyasu summoned him to\r\nOsaka, and between the rough English sailor and the Tokugawa chief\r\nthere commenced a curiously friendly intercourse which was not\r\ninterrupted until the death of Adams, twenty years later.\r\n\r\n\"The Englishman became master-shipbuilder to the Yedo Government; was\r\nemployed as diplomatic agent when other traders from his own country\r\nand from Holland arrived in Japan, received in perpetual gift a\r\nsubstantial estate, and from first to last possessed the implicit\r\nconfidence of the shogun. Ieyasu quickly discerned the man's honesty;\r\nperceived that whatever benefits foreign commerce might confer would\r\nbe increased by encouraging competition among the foreigners, and\r\nrealized that English and Dutch trade presented the wholesome feature\r\nof complete dissociation from religious propagandism. On the other\r\nhand, he showed no intolerance to either Spaniards or Portuguese. He\r\nissued (1601) two official patents sanctioning the residence of the\r\nfathers in Kyoto, Osaka, and Nagasaki; he employed Father Rodriguez\r\nas interpreter at the Court in Yedo, and, in 1603 he gave munificent\r\nsuccour to the Jesuits who were reduced to dire straits owing to the\r\ncapture of the great ship from Macao by the Dutch and the consequent\r\nloss of several years' supplies for the mission in Japan.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF IEYASU TOWARDS CHRISTIANITY AND FOREIGN\r\nINTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nFrom what has been written above it will have been evident that each\r\nof Japan's great trio of sixteenth century statesmen--Nobunaga,\r\nHideyoshi, and Ieyasu--adopted originally a tolerant demeanour\r\ntowards Christianity, and an emphatically favourable attitude towards\r\nforeign commerce. The causes of Hideyoshi's change of mood are\r\ntolerably clear, but it is not possible to analyse the case of Ieyasu\r\nwith certainty. That the Tokugawa baron strongly patronized Buddhism\r\nmight be regarded as a sufficient explanation of his ultimate\r\nhostility to the foreign faith, but cannot be reconciled with his\r\namicable attitude at the outset. The more credible explanation is\r\nthat he was guided by intelligence obtained direct from Europe. He\r\nsent thither at the end of the sixteenth century an emissary whose\r\ninstructions were to observe closely the social and political\r\nconditions in the home of Christianity. The better to accomplish his\r\npurpose this envoy embraced the Christian faith, and was thus enabled\r\nto carry on his observations from within as well as from without.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily conceived that the state of affairs in Europe at\r\nthat time, when recounted to Ieyasu, could scarcely fail to shock and\r\nastonish the ruler of a country where freedom of conscience may be\r\nsaid to have always existed. The Inquisition and the stake; wholesale\r\naggressions in the name of the Cross; a head of the Church whose\r\nauthority extended to confiscation of the realms of heretical\r\nsovereigns; religious wars, and profound fanaticism--these were the\r\nelements of the story told to Ieyasu by his returned envoy. The\r\ndetails could not fail to produce an evil impression. Already his own\r\nobservation had disclosed to the Tokugawa chief abundant evidence of\r\nthe spirit of strife engendered by Christian dogma in those times. No\r\nsooner had the Franciscans and the Dominicans arrived in Japan than a\r\nfierce quarrel broke out between them and the Jesuits--a quarrel\r\nwhich even community of suffering could not compose. \"Not less\r\nrepellent was an attempt on the part of the Spaniards to dictate to\r\nIeyasu the expulsion of all Hollanders from Japan, and an attempt on\r\nthe part of the Jesuits to dictate the expulsion of the Spaniards.\r\nThe former proposal, couched almost in the form of a demand, was\r\ntwice formulated, and accompanied on the second occasion by a\r\nscarcely less insulting offer, namely, that Spanish men-of-war would\r\nbe sent to Japan to burn all Dutch ships found in the ports of the\r\nempire. If in the face of proposals so contumelious of his authority\r\nIeyasu preserved a calm and dignified mein, merely replying that his\r\ncountry was open to all comers, and that, if other nations had\r\nquarrels among themselves, they must not take Japan for\r\nbattle-ground, it is nevertheless unimaginable that he did not\r\nstrongly resent such interference with his own independent foreign\r\npolicy, and that he did not interpret it as foreshadowing a\r\ndisturbance of the realm's peace by sectarian quarrels among\r\nChristians.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nThe repellent aspects under which Christianity thus presented itself\r\nto Ieyasu were supplemented by an act of fraud and forgery\r\nperpetrated in the interest of a Christian feudatory by a trusted\r\nofficial, himself a Christian. This experience persuaded the Tokugawa\r\nruler that it was unsafe to employ Christians at his Court. He not\r\nonly dismissed all those so employed, but also banished them from\r\nYedo and forbade any feudal chief to harbour them. Another incident,\r\nnot without influence, was connected with the survey of the Japanese\r\ncoast by a Spanish mariner and a Franciscan friar. An envoy from New\r\nSpain (Mexico) had obtained permission for this survey, but \"when the\r\nmariner (Sebastian) and the friar (Sotelo) hastened to carry out the\r\nproject, Ieyasu asked Will Adams to explain this display of industry.\r\nThe Englishman replied that such a proceeding would be regarded in\r\nEurope as an act of hostility, especially on the part of the\r\nSpaniards or Portuguese, whose aggressions were notorious. He added,\r\nin reply to further questions, that 'the Roman priesthood had been\r\nexpelled from many parts of Germany, from Sweden, Norway, Denmark,\r\nHolland, and England, and that, although his own country preserved\r\nthe pure form of the Christian faith from which Spain and Portugal\r\nhad deviated, yet neither English nor Dutch considered that that fact\r\nafforded them any reason to war with, or to annex, States which were\r\nnot Christian solely for the reason that they were non-Christian.'\"*\r\nHearing these things from Will Adams, Ieyasu is said to have\r\nremarked, \"If the sovereigns of Europe do not tolerate these priests,\r\nI do them no wrong if I refuse to tolerate them.\"\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nAnother incident, too complicated to describe in detail, may be\r\nsummed up by saying that some Japanese Christians were discovered to\r\nhave conspired for the overthrow of the Tokugawa Government by the\r\naid of foreign troops. It was not an extensive plot, but it helped to\r\ndemonstrate that the sympathy of the priests and their converts was\r\nplainly with the enemies of Tokugawa's supremacy. Ieyasu, however,\r\nabstained from extreme measures in the case of any of the foreign\r\npriests, and he might have been equally tolerant towards native\r\nChristians, also, had not the Tokugawa authority been openly defied\r\nin Yedo itself by a Franciscan father--the Sotelo mentioned above.\r\n\"Then (1613) the first execution of Japanese converts took place,\r\nthough the monk himself was released after a short incarceration. At\r\nthat time... insignificant differences of custom sometimes induced\r\nserious misconceptions. A Christian who had violated a secular law\r\nwas crucified in Nagasaki. Many of his fellow-believers kneeled\r\naround his cross and prayed for the peace of his soul. A party of\r\nconverts were afterwards burnt to death in the same place for\r\nrefusing to apostatize, and their Christian friends crowded to carry\r\noff portions of their bodies as holy relics. When these things were\r\nreported to Ieyasu, he said, 'Without doubt that must be a diabolic\r\nfaith which persuades people not only to worship criminals condemned\r\nto death for their crimes, but also to honour those who have been\r\nburned or cut to pieces by the order of their lord.'\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by Brinkley.\r\n\r\nSUPPRESSION OF CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nThe first prohibition of Christianity was issued by Ieyasu in\r\nSeptember, 1612, and was followed by another in April, 1613; but both\r\nbore the character of warnings rather than of punitive regulations.\r\nIt was on the 27th of January, 1614--that is to say, fifty-four years\r\nand five months after the landing of Xavier at Kagoshima--that an\r\nedict appeared ordering that all the foreign priests should be\r\ncollected in Nagasaki preparatory to removal from Japan; that all\r\nchurches should be pulled down, and that all converts should be\r\ncompelled to abjure Christianity. There were then in Japan 156\r\nministers of Christianity, namely, 122 Jesuits, 14 Franciscans, 9\r\nDominicans, 4 Augustinians, and 7 secular priests. It is virtually\r\ncertain that if these men had obeyed the orders of the Japanese\r\nGovernment by leaving the country finally, not so much as one\r\nforeigner would have suffered for his faith in Japan, except the six\r\nFranciscans executed on the \"Martyrs' Mount\" at Nagasaki by\r\nHideyoshi's order, in 1597. But the missionaries did not obey.\r\nSuffering or even death counted for nothing with these men as against\r\nthe possibility of saving souls. \"Forty-seven of them evaded the\r\nedict, some by concealing themselves at the time of its issue, the\r\nrest by leaving their ships when the latter had passed out of sight\r\nof the shore of Japan, and returning by boats to the scene of their\r\nformer labours. Moreover, in a few months, those that had actually\r\ncrossed the sea re-crossed it in various disguises.\"* The Japanese\r\nGovernment had then to consider whether it would suffer its authority\r\nto be thus defied by foreign visitors or whether it would resort to\r\nextreme measures.\r\n\r\n*Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition; article \"Japan,\" by Brinkley.\r\n\r\nPERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO 1613\r\n\r\nThroughout a period of two years immediately following the issue of\r\nthe anti-Christian edict of 1614, the attention of Ieyasu, and indeed\r\nof the whole Japanese nation, was concentrated on the struggle which\r\ntook place between the adherents of the Tokugawa and the supporters\r\nof Hideyori. That struggle culminated in an assault on the castle of\r\nOsaka, and fresh fuel was added to the fire of anti-Christian\r\nresentment inasmuch as many Christian converts espoused Hideyori's\r\ncause, and in one part of the field the troops of Ieyasu had to fight\r\nagainst a foe whose banners were emblazoned with a cross and with\r\nimages of Christ and of St. James, the patron saint of Spain.\r\nNevertheless, the Christian converts possessed the sympathy of so\r\nmany of the feudal chiefs that much reluctance was shown to inflict\r\nthe extreme penalty of the law on men and women whose only crime was\r\nthe adoption of an alien religion. Some of the feudal chiefs, even at\r\nthe risk of losing their estates, gave asylum to the converts; others\r\nfalsely reported a complete absence of Christians in their dominions,\r\nand some endeavoured earnestly to protect the fanatics; while, as to\r\nthe people at large, their liberal spirit is shown in the fact that\r\nfive priests who were in Osaka Castle at the time of its capture were\r\nable to make their way to distant refuges without any risk of\r\nbetrayal.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: GREEN-ROOM OF A THEATRE (In the Middle of the Tokugawa\r\nPeriod)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were not wanting feudatories who, judging\r\nthat zeal in obeying the edict would prove a passport to official\r\nreward, acted on that conviction. Notably was this true of Hasegawa,\r\nwho received the fief of Arima by way of recompense for barbarous\r\ncruelty towards the Christians. Yet it is on record that when this\r\nbaron sent out a mixed force of Hizen and Satsuma troops to harry the\r\nconverts, these samurai warned the Christians to flee and then\r\nreported that they were not to be found anywhere. During these events\r\nthe death of Ieyasu took place (June 1, 1616), and pending the\r\ndedication of his mausoleum the anti-Christian crusade was virtually\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nENGLISH AND DUTCH INTRIGUES AGAINST SPANIARDS AND PORTUGUESE\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently alleged that if the Spaniards and the\r\nPortuguese endeavoured to bring the Hollanders into bad odour, the\r\nEnglish and the Dutch intrigued equally against the Portuguese and\r\nthe Spaniards. The accusation cannot be rebutted. Cocks, the factor\r\nof the English commercial mission to Japan, has himself left it on\r\nrecord that, being at the Yedo Court in the fall of 1616, \"I enformed\r\nthe two secretaries that yf they lookt out well about these two\r\nSpanish shipps in Xaxama [Satsuma] full of men and treasure, they\r\nwould fynd that they were sent off purpose by the king of Spaine,\r\nhaving knowledge of the death of the ould Emperour [Ieyasu], thinking\r\nsom papisticall tono [daimyo] might rise and rebell and so draw all\r\nthe papists to flock to them and take part, by which means they might\r\non a sudden seaz upon som strong place and keepe it till more succors\r\ncame, they not wanting money nor men for thackomplishing such a\r\nstrattgin.\" The two vessels in question were \"greate shipps arrived\r\nout of New Spaine, bound, as they said, for the Philippines, but\r\ndriven into that place per contrary wynd, both shipps being full of\r\nsouldiers, with great store of treasure, as it is said, above five\r\nmillions of pezos.\" It is true that a Spanish captain sent from these\r\nvessels to pay respects to the Court in Yedo \"gave it out that our\r\nshipps and the Hollanders which were at Firando [Hirado] had taken\r\nand robbed all the China junks, which was the occasion that very few\r\nor non came into Japan this yeare,\" and therefore Cocks was somewhat\r\njustified in saying \"so in this sort I cried quittance with the\r\nSpaniards.\" It appears, however, that the Spaniards were not\r\nbelieved, whereas the Englishman could boast, \"which speeches of myne\r\nwrought so far that the Emperour sent to stay them, and had not the\r\ngreate shipp cut her cable in the hawse so as to escape, she had been\r\narrested.\" It was this same Cocks who told a Japanese \"admirall\" that\r\n\"My opinion was he might doe better to put it into the Emperour's\r\nmynd to make a conquest of the Manillas, and drive those small crew\r\nof Spaniards from thence.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, none of the four Occidental nationalities then in Japan had\r\nany monopoly of slandering its rivals. The accusation preferred by\r\nCocks, however, must have possessed special significance, confirming,\r\nas it did, what the pilot of the San Felipe had said twenty years\r\npreviously as to the political uses to which the propagandists of\r\nChristianity were put by the King of Spain, and what Will Adams had\r\nsaid four years earlier as to the Imperial doctrine of Spain and\r\nPortugal that the annexation of a non-Christian country was always\r\njustifiable. The \"greate shipps out of New Spaine,\" laden with\r\nsoldiers and treasure and under orders to combine with any Christian\r\nconverts willing to revolt against the Yedo Government, were concrete\r\nevidence of the truth of the Spanish sailor's revelation and of the\r\nEnglish exile's charge. It has always to be remembered, too, that\r\nKyushu, the headquarters of Christianity in Japan, did not owe to the\r\nTokugawa shoguns the same degree of allegiance that it had been\r\nforced to render to Hideyoshi. A colossal campaign such as the latter\r\nhad conducted against the southern island, in 1587, never commended\r\nitself to the ambition of Ieyasu or to that of his comparatively\r\nfeeble successor, Hidetada. Hence, the presence of Spanish or\r\nPortuguese ships in Satsuma suggested danger of an exceptional\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nIn the very month (September, 1616) when Cocks \"cried quittance with\r\nthe Spaniards,\" a new anti-Christian edict was promulgated by\r\nHidetada, son and successor of Ieyasu. It pronounced sentence of\r\nexile against all Christian priests, not excluding even those whose\r\npresence had been sanctioned for the purpose of ministering to the\r\nPortuguese merchants; it forbade the Japanese, under penalty of being\r\nburned alive and having all their property confiscated, to connect\r\nthemselves in any way with the Christian propagandists or with their\r\nco-operators or servants, and above all, to show them any\r\nhospitality. The same penalties were extended to women and children,\r\nand to the five neighbours on both sides of a convert's abode, unless\r\nthese became informers. Every feudal chief was forbidden to keep\r\nChristians in his service, and the edict was promulgated with more\r\nthan usual severity, although its enforcement was deferred until the\r\nnext year on account of the obsequies of Ieyasu. This edict of 1616\r\ndiffered from that issued by Ieyasu in 1614, since the latter did not\r\nexplicitly prescribe the death-penalty for converts refusing to\r\napostatize. But both agreed in indicating expulsion as the sole\r\nmanner of dealing with the foreign priests. It, is also noteworthy\r\nthat, just as the edict of Ieyasu was immediately preceded by\r\nstatements from Will Adams about the claim of Spain and Portugal to\r\nabsorb all non-Christian countries, so the edict of Hidetada had for\r\npreface Cock's attribution of aggressive designs to the Spanish ships\r\nat Kagoshima in conjunction with Christian converts. Not without\r\njustice, therefore, have the English been charged with some share of\r\nresponsibility for the terrible things that ultimately befell the\r\npropagandists and the professors of Christianity in Japan. As for the\r\nshogun, Hidetada, and his advisers, it is probable that they did not\r\nforesee much occasion for actual recourse to violence. They knew that\r\na great majority of the converts had joined the Christian Church at\r\nthe instance, or by the command, of their local rulers, and nothing\r\ncan have seemed less likely than that a creed thus lightly embraced\r\nwould be adhered to in defiance of torture and death. The foreign\r\npropagandists also might have escaped all peril by obeying the\r\nofficial edict and leaving Japan. They suffered because they defied\r\nthe laws of the land.\r\n\r\nSome fifty of them happened to be in Nagasaki at the time of\r\nHidetada's edict. Several of these were apprehended and deported, but\r\na number returned almost immediately. This happened under the\r\njurisdiction of Omura, who had been specially charged with the duty\r\nof sending away the bateren (padres). He seems to have concluded that\r\na striking example must be furnished, and he therefore ordered the\r\nseizure and decapitation of two fathers, De l'Assumpcion and Machado.\r\nThe result completely falsified his calculations, for so far from\r\nproving a deterrent, the fate of the two fathers appealed widely to\r\nthe people's sense of heroism. Multitudes flocked to the grave in\r\nwhich the two coffins were buried. The sick were carried thither to\r\nbe restored to health, and the Christian converts derived new courage\r\nfrom the example of these martyrs. Numerous conversions and numerous\r\nreturns of apostates took place everywhere.\r\n\r\nWhile this enthusiasm was at its height, Navarette, vice-provincial\r\nof the Dominicans, and Ayala, vice-provincial of the Augustins,\r\nemerged from hiding, and robed in their full canonicals, commenced an\r\nopen propaganda, heralding their approach by a letter addressed to\r\nOmura and couched in the most defiant terms. Thus challenged, Omura\r\nwas obliged to act promptly, especially as Navarette declared that he\r\n(Navarette) did not recognize the Emperor of Japan but only the\r\nEmperor of Heaven. The two fanatics were seized, conveyed secretly to\r\nthe island of Takashima, and there decapitated; their coffins being\r\nweighted with big stones and sunk in the sea, so as to prevent a\r\nrepetition of the scenes witnessed at the tomb of the fathers\r\nmentioned above. Thereupon, the newly elected superior of the\r\nDominicans at once sent three of his priests to preach in Omura's\r\nterritories, and two of them, having been seized, were cast into\r\nprison where they remained for five years. Even more directly defiant\r\nwas the attitude of the next martyred priest, an old Franciscan monk,\r\nJuan de Santa Martha. He had for three years suffered all the horrors\r\nof a medieval Japanese prison, yet when it was proposed to release\r\nhim and deport him to New Spain, his answer was that, if released, he\r\nwould stay in Japan and preach there. He laid his head on the block\r\nin August, 1618.\r\n\r\nThroughout the next four years, however, no other foreign missionary\r\nwas capitally punished in Japan, though many arrived and continued\r\ntheir propagandism. During that interval, also, there occurred\r\nanother incident calculated to fix upon the Christians still deeper\r\nsuspicion of political designs. In a Portuguese ship, captured by the\r\nDutch, a letter was found instigating Japanese converts to revolt,\r\nand promising that, when the number of disaffected became sufficient,\r\nmen-of-war would be sent from Portugal to aid them. Another factor\r\ntending to invest the converts with political potentialities was the\r\nwriting of pamphlets by apostates, attributing the zeal of foreign\r\npropagandists solely to traitorous motives. Further, the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese propagandists were indicted in a despatch addressed to the\r\nsecond Tokugawa shogun, in 1620, by the admiral in command of the\r\nBritish and Dutch fleet of defence, then cruising in Oriental waters.\r\nThe admiral unreservedly charged the friars with treacherous\r\nmachinations, and warned the shogun against the aggressive designs of\r\nPhilip of Spain.\r\n\r\nThis cumulative evidence dispelled the last doubts of the Japanese,\r\nand a time of sharp suffering ensued for the fathers and their\r\nconverts. There were many shocking episodes. Among them may be\r\nmentioned the case of Zufliga, son of the marquis of Villamanrica. He\r\nvisited Japan as a Dominican in 1618, but the governor of Nagasaki\r\npersuaded him to withdraw. Yielding for the moment, he returned two\r\nyears later, accompanied by Father Flores. They travelled in a vessel\r\ncommanded by a Japanese Christian, and off Formosa she was overhauled\r\nby an English warship, which took off the two priests and handed them\r\nover to the Dutch at Hirado. There they were tortured and held in\r\nprison for sixteen months, when an armed attempt made by some\r\nJapanese Christians to rescue them precipitated their fate. By order\r\nfrom Yedo, Zuniga, Flores, and the Japanese master of the vessel\r\nwhich had carried them, were roasted to death in Nagasaki on August\r\n19, 1622. Thus the measures adopted against the missionaries are seen\r\nto have gradually increased in severity. The first two fathers put to\r\ndeath, De l'Assumpcion and Machado, were beheaded in 1617, not by the\r\ncommon executioner but by one of the principal officers of the\r\ndaimyo. The next two, Navarette and Ayala, were decapitated by the\r\nexecutioner. Then, in 1618, Juan de Santa Martha was executed like a\r\ncommon criminal, his body being dismembered and his head exposed.\r\nFinally, in 1622, Zuniga and Flores were burned alive.\r\n\r\nThe same year was marked by the \"great martyrdom\" at Nagasaki, when\r\nnine foreign priests went to the stake together with nineteen\r\nJapanese converts. Apprehension of a foreign invasion seems to have\r\ngreatly troubled the shogun at this time. He had sent an envoy to\r\nEurope who, after seven years abroad, returned on the eve of the\r\n\"great martyrdom,\" and made a report thoroughly unfavourable to\r\nChristianity. Hidetada therefore refused to give audience to the\r\nPhilippine embassy in 1624, and ordered that all Spaniards should be\r\ndeported from Japan. It was further decreed that no Japanese\r\nChristians should thenceforth be allowed to go to sea in search of\r\ncommerce, and that although non-Christians or men who had apostatized\r\nmight travel freely, they must not visit the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThus ended all intercourse between Japan and Spain. The two countries\r\nhad been on friendly terms for thirty-two years, and during that time\r\na widespread conviction that Christianity was an instrument of\r\nSpanish aggression had been engendered. Iemitsu, son of Hidetada, now\r\nruled in Yedo, though Hidetada himself remained \"the power behind the\r\nthrone.\" The year (1623) of the former's accession to the shogunate\r\nhad seen the re-issue of anti-Christian decrees and the martyrdom of\r\nsome five hundred Christians within the Tokugawa domains, whither the\r\ntide of persecution now flowed for the first time. From that period\r\nonwards official attempts to eradicate Christianity in Japan were\r\nunceasing. Conspicuously active in this cause were two governors of\r\nNagasaki, by name Mizuno and Takenaka, and the feudal chief of\r\nShimabara, by name Matsukura. To this last is to be credited the\r\nterrible device of throwing converts into the solfataras at Unzen,\r\nand under him, also, the punishment of the \"fosse\" was resorted to.\r\nIt consisted in suspension by the feet, head downwards in a pit until\r\ndeath ensued. By many this latter torture was heroically endured to\r\nthe end, but in the case of a few the pains proved unendurable.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that the menace of a Spanish invasion seemed so\r\nimminent to Matsukura and Takenaka that they proposed an attack on\r\nthe Philippines so as to deprive the Spaniards of their base in the\r\nEast. This bold measure failed to obtain approval in Yedo. In\r\nproportion as the Christian converts proved invincible, the severity\r\nof the repressive measures increased. There are no accurate\r\nstatistics showing the number of victims. Some annalists allege that\r\ntwo hundred and eighty thousand perished up to the year 1635, but\r\nthat figure is probably exaggerated, for the converts do not seem to\r\nhave aggregated more than three hundred thousand at any time, and it\r\nis probable that a majority of these, having embraced the alien creed\r\nfor light reasons, discarded it readily under menace of destruction.\r\n\"Every opportunity was given for apostatizing and for escaping death.\r\nImmunity could be secured by pointing out a fellow convert, and when\r\nit is observed that among the seven or eight feudatories who embraced\r\nChristianity only two or three died in that faith, we must conclude\r\nthat not a few cases of recanting occurred among the vassals.\r\nRemarkable fortitude, however, is said to have been displayed.\"\r\nCaron, one of the Dutch traders of Hirado, writing in 1636, says:\r\n\r\nAt first the believers in Christ were only beheaded and afterwards\r\nattached to a cross, which was considered as a sufficiently heavy\r\npunishment. But when many of them were seen to die with emotions of\r\njoy and pleasure, some even to go singing to the place of execution;\r\nand when although thirty and sometimes one hundred were put to death\r\nat a time, and it was found that their numbers did not appear to\r\ndiminish, it was then determined to use every exertion to change\r\ntheir joy into grief and their songs into tears and groans of misery.\r\nTo effect this they were tied to stakes and burned alive; were\r\nbroiled on wooden gridirons, and thousands were thus wretchedly\r\ndestroyed. But as the number of Christians was not perceptibly\r\nlessened by these cruel punishments, they became tired of putting\r\nthem to death, and attempts were then made to make the Christians\r\nabandon their faith by the infliction of the most dreadful torments\r\nwhich the most diabolical invention could suggest. The Japanese\r\nChristians, however, endured these persecutions with a great deal of\r\nsteadiness and courage; very few, in comparison with those who\r\nremained steadfast in the faith, were the number of those who fainted\r\nunder the trials and abjured their religion. It is true that these\r\npeople possess, on such occasions, a stoicism and an intrepidity of\r\nwhich no examples are to be met with in the bulk of other nations.\r\nNeither men nor women are afraid of death. Yet an uncommon\r\nsteadfastness in the faith must, at the same time, be requisite to\r\ncontinue in these trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe intrepidity of the native converts was rivalled by the courage of\r\ntheir foreign teachers. Again and again these latter defied the\r\nJapanese authorities by visiting Japan--not for the first time but\r\noccasionally even after having been deported. Contrary to the orders\r\nof the governors of Macao and Manila, nay of the King of Spain\r\nhimself, the priests arrived, year after year, with the certainty of\r\nbeing apprehended and sent to the stake after brief periods of\r\npropagandism. In 1626, when the campaign of persecution was at its\r\nheight, more than three thousand converts were baptized by these\r\nbrave priests, of whom none is known to have escaped death except\r\nthose that apostatized under torture, and they were very few,\r\nalthough not only could life be saved by abandoning the faith but\r\nalso ample allowances of money could be obtained from the\r\nauthorities. Anyone denouncing a propagandist received large reward,\r\nand the people were required to prove their orthodoxy by trampling\r\nupon a picture of Christ.\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE DUTCH AND THE PORTUGUESE\r\n\r\nWhile the above events were in progress, the disputes between the\r\nDutch, the Portuguese, and the Spaniards went on without cessation.\r\nIn 1636, the Dutch discovered in a captured Portuguese vessel a\r\nreport written by the governor of Macao, describing a festival which\r\nhad just been held there in honour of Vieyra, who had been martyred\r\nin Japan. The Dutch transmitted this document to the Japanese \"in\r\norder that his Majesty may see more clearly what great honour the\r\nPortuguese pay to those he had forbidden his realm as traitors to the\r\nState and to his crown.\" It does not appear that this accusation\r\nadded much to the resentment and distrust against the Portuguese. At\r\nany rate, the Bakufu in Yedo took no step distinctly hostile to\r\nPortuguese laymen until the following year (1637), when an edict was\r\nissued forbidding \"any foreigners to travel in the empire lest\r\nPortuguese with passports bearing Dutch names might enter.\"\r\n\r\nTHE SHIMABARA REVOLT\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1637, there occurred a rebellion, historically known\r\nas the \"Christian Revolt of Shimabara,\" which put an end to Japan's\r\nforeign intercourse for over two hundred years. The Gulf of Nagasaki\r\nis bounded on the west by the island of Amakusa and by the promontory\r\nof Shimabara. In the early years of Jesuit propagandism in Japan,\r\nShimabara and Amakusa had been the two most thoroughly Christianized\r\nregions, and in later days they were naturally the scene of the\r\nseverest persecutions. Nevertheless, the people might have suffered\r\nin silence, as did their fellow believers elsewhere, had they not\r\nbeen taxed beyond endurance to supply funds for an extravagant\r\nfeudatory. Japanese annalists, however, relegate the taxation\r\ngrievance to an altogether secondary place, and attribute the revolt\r\nsolely to the instigation of five samurai who led a roving life to\r\navoid persecution for their adherence to Christianity. Whichever\r\nversion be correct, it is certain that the outbreak attracted all the\r\nChristians from the surrounding regions, and was officially regarded\r\nas a Christian rising. The Amakusa insurgents passed over from that\r\nisland to Shimabara, and on the 27th of January, 1638, the whole\r\nbody--numbering, according to some authorities, twenty thousand\r\nfighting men with thirteen thousand women and children; according to\r\nothers, little more than one-half of these figures--took possession\r\nof the dilapidated castle of Kara, which stood on a plateau with\r\nthree sides descending one hundred feet perpendicularly to the sea\r\nand with a swamp on the fourth side.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents fought under flags inscribed with red crosses and\r\ntheir battle cries were \"Jesus,\" \"Maria,\" and \"St. Iago.\" They\r\ndefended the castle successfully against repeated assaults until the\r\n12th of April, when, their provisions and their ammunition alike\r\nbeing exhausted, they were overwhelmed and put to the sword, with the\r\nexception of 105 prisoners. During this siege the Dutch gave\r\npractical proof of their enmity to the Christianity of the Spaniards\r\nand Portuguese. For, the guns in the possession of the besiegers\r\nbeing too light to accomplish anything effective, application was\r\nmade to Koeckebacker, the Dutch factor at Hirado, to lend ships\r\ncarrying heavier metal. He complied by despatching the De Ryp, and\r\nher twenty guns threw 426 shots into the castle in fifteen days.\r\nThere has been handed down a letter carried by an arrow from the\r\ncastle to the besiegers. It was not an appeal for mercy but a simple\r\nenumeration of reasons:--\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of our people we have now resorted to this castle. You\r\nwill no doubt think that we have done this with the hope of taking\r\nlands and houses. Such is by no means the case. It is simply because\r\nChristianity is not tolerated as a distinct sect, which is well known\r\nto you. Frequent prohibitions have been published by the shogun, to\r\nour great distress. Some among us there are who consider the hope of\r\nfuture life as of the highest importance. For these there is no\r\nescape. Because they will not change their religion they incur\r\nvarious kinds of severe punishments, being inhumanly subjected to\r\nshame and extensive suffering, till at last for their devotion to the\r\nLord of Heaven, they are tortured to death. Others, even men of\r\nresolution, solicitous for the sensitive body and dreading the\r\ntorture, have, while hiding their grief, obeyed the royal will and\r\nrecanted. Things continuing in this state, all the people have united\r\nin an uprising in an unaccountable and miraculous manner. Should we\r\ncontinue to live as heretofore and the above laws not be repealed, we\r\nmust incur all sorts of punishments hard to be endured; we must, our\r\nbodies being weak and sensitive, sin against the infinite Lord of\r\nHeaven and from solicitude for our brief lives incur the loss of what\r\nwe highly esteem. These things fill us with grief beyond endurance.\r\nHence we are in our present condition. It is not the result of a\r\ncorrupt doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that of the remaining Japanese Christians the great\r\nbulk perished at the massacre of Kara. Thenceforth there were few\r\nmartyrs, and though Christianity was not entirely extirpated in\r\nJapan, it survived only in remote places and by stealth.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: NANBAN BELL\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THE \"KAIYO KWAN,\" THE FIRST WARSHIP OF JAPAN (Built in\r\nHolland for the Tokugawa Feudal Government)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE TOKUGAWA SHOGUNATE\r\n\r\nTHE Tokugawa family traced its descent from Nitta Yoshishige of the\r\nMinamoto sept (the Seiwa Genji) who flourished at the beginning of\r\nthe thirteenth century. His son's place of residence was at the\r\nvillage of Tokugawa in Kotsuke province: hence the name, Tokugawa.\r\nAfter a few generations, Chikauji, the then representative of the\r\nfamily, had to fly to the village of Matsudaira in Mikawa province,\r\ntaking the name of Matsudaira. Gradually the family acquired\r\npossession of about one-half of Mikawa province, and in the seventh\r\ngeneration from Chikauji, the head of the house, Hirotada, crossing\r\nswords with Oda Nobuhide, father of Nobunaga, sought succour from the\r\nImagawa family, to which he sent his son, Ieyasu, with fifty other\r\nyoung samurai as hostages. This was in 1547, Ieyasu being then in his\r\nfifth year.\r\n\r\nOn the way from Okazaki, which was the stronghold of Hirotada, the\r\nparty fell into the hands of Nobuhide's officers, and Ieyasu was\r\nconfined in a temple where he remained until 1559, when he obtained\r\npermission to return to Okazaki, being then a vassal of the Imagawa\r\nfamily. But when (1569) the Imagawa suffered defeat in the battle of\r\nOkehazama, at the hands of Oda Nobunaga, Ieyasu allied himself with\r\nthe latter. In 1570, he removed to Hamamatsu, having subjugated the\r\nprovinces of Mikawa and Totomi. He was forty years old at the time of\r\nNobunaga's murder, and it has been shown above that he espoused the\r\ncause of the Oda family in the campaign of Komak-yama. At forty-nine\r\nhe became master of the Kwanto and was in his fifty-sixth year when\r\nHideyoshi died. Ieyasu had nine sons: (1) Nobuyasu; (2) Hideyasu\r\n(daimyo of Echizen); (3) Hidetada (second shoguri); (4) Tadayoshi\r\n(daimyo of Kiyosu); (5) Nobuyoshi (daimyo of Mito); (6) Tadateru\r\n(daimyo of Echigo); (7) Yoshinao (daimyo of Owari); (8) Yorinobu\r\n(daimyo of Kii), and (9) Yorifusa (daimyo of Mito). He had also three\r\ndaughters; the first married to Okudaira Masanobu; the second to\r\nIkeda Terumasa, and the third to Asano Nagaakira.\r\n\r\nEVENTS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE BATTLE OF SEKIGAHARA\r\n\r\nThe political complications that followed the death of the Taiko are\r\nextremely difficult to unravel, and the result is not commensurate\r\nwith the trouble. Several annalists have sought to prove that Ieyasu\r\nstrenuously endeavoured to observe faithfully the oath of loyalty\r\nmade by him to Hideyoshi on the latter's death-bed. They claim for\r\nhim that until his hands were forced he steadfastly and faithfully\r\nworked in the interests of Hideyoshi. But his acts do not lend\r\nthemselves to any such interpretation. The best that can be said of\r\nhim is that he believed himself to have been entrusted by the Taiko\r\nwith discretionary power to determine the expediency of Hideyori's\r\nsuccession, and that he exercised that power in the interests of the\r\nTokugawa family, not of the Toyotomi.\r\n\r\nCircumstances helped him as they do generally help great men. From\r\nthe time of the birth of the lady Yodo's second son, the official\r\nworld in Kyoto had been divided into two factions. The Hidetsugu\r\ncatastrophe accentuated the lines of division, and the Korean\r\ncampaign had a similar effect by affording a field for bitter rivalry\r\nbetween the forces of Konishi Yukinaga, who belonged to the Yodo\r\nfaction, and Kato Kiyomasa, who was a protege of Hideyoshi's wife,\r\nYae. Further fuel was added to this fire of antagonism when the order\r\nwent forth that the army should leave Korea, for the Kato faction\r\nprotested against surrendering all the fruits of the campaign without\r\nany tangible recompense, and the Konishi party insisted that the\r\nTaiko's dying words must be obeyed implicitly. In this dispute,\r\nIshida Katsushige, the chief actor in the Hidetsugu tragedy, took a\r\nprominent part. For, when in their capacity as belonging to the Board\r\nof Five Administrators, Ishida and Asano Nagamasa were sent to Kyushu\r\nto superintend the evacuation of the Korean peninsula, they, too,\r\nfell into a controversy on the same subject. Ieyasu stood aloof from\r\nboth parties. His policy was to let the feud develop and to step in\r\nhimself at the supreme moment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was the aim of Ishida Katsushige to involve the\r\nTokugawa chief, thus compassing his downfall and opening an avenue\r\nfor the ascension of Ishida himself to the place of dictator. Allied\r\nwith Ishida in this plot was his colleague on the Board of Five\r\nAdministrators, Masuda Nagamori. Their method was to create enmity\r\nbetween Ieyasu and Maeda Toshiiye, to whom the Taiko had entrusted\r\nthe guardianship of Hideyori and of the Osaka Castle. This design was\r\nbarely thwarted by the intervention of Hosokawa Tadaoki (ancestor of\r\nthe present Marquis Hosokawa). Ieyasu was well informed as to\r\nIshida's schemes on two other occasions; the first immediately\r\nbefore, the second just after, the death of the Taiko. In each case\r\nrumours of an armed outbreak were suddenly circulated in Fushimi for\r\nthe purpose of creating confusion such as might furnish an\r\nopportunity to strike suddenly at Ieyasu. These essays failed in both\r\ninstances, and the Tokugawa chief, instead of retaliating by direct\r\nimpeachment of Ishida, applied himself to cementing close relations\r\nwith certain great daimyo by matrimonial alliances. Such unions had\r\nbeen implicitly interdicted by the Taiko, and the procedure of Ieyasu\r\nelicited a written protest from the boards of the Five Senior\r\nMinisters and the Five Administrators. They threatened Ieyasu with\r\ndismissal from the former board unless he furnished a satisfactory\r\nexplanation. This he declined to do and for some time a very strained\r\nsituation existed in Kyoto, an armed struggle being ultimately\r\naverted by the good offices of the Three Middle Ministers.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, however, that the circumstances had become critical,\r\nand it was further evident that, as long as Ishida Katsushige's\r\nintrigues continued, a catastrophe might at any moment be\r\nprecipitated. Sensible of these things, a party of loyal men, spoken\r\nof in history as the \"seven generals\"--Ikeda Terumasa (ancestor of\r\nthe present Marquis Ikeda); Kato Kiyomasa; Kuroda Nagamasa (son of\r\nKuroda Yoshitaka, and ancestor of the present Marquis Kuroda);\r\nFukushima Masanori, Asano Yukinaga (son of Asano Nagamasa and\r\nancestor of the present Marquis Asano); Hosokawa Tadaoki, and Kato\r\nYoshiaki (ancestor of the present Viscount Kato)--vowed to take\r\nIshida's life, while he was still in Osaka Castle, whither he had\r\ngone (1599) to attend the death-bed of his friend, Maeda Toshiiye.\r\nIshida, finding himself powerless to resist such a combination after\r\nthe death of Maeda, took an extraordinary step; he appealed to the\r\nprotection of Ieyasu--that is to say, to the protection of the very\r\nman against whom all his plots had been directed. And Ieyasu\r\nprotected him.\r\n\r\nWe are here confronted by a riddle which has never been clearly\r\ninterpreted. Why did Ishida seek asylum from Ieyasu whom he had\r\npersistently intrigued to overthrow, and why did Ieyasu, having full\r\nknowledge of these intrigues, grant asylum? Possibly an answer to the\r\nformer question can be furnished by the fact that Ishida was in sore\r\nstraits. Attending Maeda Toshiiye's death-bed, he had seen the\r\npartisans of the deceased baron transfer their allegiance to Ieyasu\r\nthrough the intervention of Hosokawa Tadaoki, and he had learned that\r\nhis own life was immediately threatened by the seven generals. Even\r\nif he succeeded (which was very problematical) in escaping from Osaka\r\nto his own castle of Sawa-yama, in Omi province, the respite could\r\nhave been but brief and such a step would have been equivalent to\r\nabandoning the political arena. Only a very strong arm could save\r\nhim, and with consummate insight he may have appreciated the Tokugawa\r\nchief's unreadiness to precipitate a crucial struggle by consenting\r\nto his death.\r\n\r\nBut what is to be said of Ieyasu? Unwilling to admit that his\r\nastuteness could ever have been at fault, some historians allege that\r\nthe Tokugawa chief saved Ishida's life with the deliberate purpose of\r\nletting him discredit himself and his partisans by continued\r\nintrigues. These annalists allege, in fact, that Ieyasu, acting on\r\nthe advice of Honda Masanobu, by whose profound shrewdness he was\r\nlargely guided, saved the life of Ishida in order that the latter's\r\nsubsequent intrigues might furnish a pretext for destroying Hideyori.\r\nThat, however, is scarcely conceivable, for Ishida had many powerful\r\nconfederates, and the direct outcome of the leniency shown by Ieyasu\r\non that occasion was an armed struggle from which he barely emerged\r\nvictorious. The truth seems to be that, for all his profound wisdom,\r\nIeyasu erred in this instance. Ishida Kotsushige outwitted him. For,\r\nduring the very days of his asylum in Fushimi, under the protection\r\nof Ieyasu, Ishida opened secret communication with Uesugi Kagekatsu\r\nand invited him to strike at the Tokugawa. Uesugi consented. It must\r\nbe observed that the character of Ishida has been portrayed for\r\nposterity mainly by historians who were under Tokugawa influence.\r\nModern and impartial annalists are by no means so condemnatory in\r\ntheir judgment of the man. In whatever arts of deception Ishida\r\nexcelled, Ieyasu was at least his equal; while in the matter of\r\nloyalty to the Toyotomi family, Ishida's conduct compares favourably\r\nwith that of the Tokugawa leader; and if we look at the men who\r\nattached themselves to Ishida's cause and fought by his side, we are\r\nobliged to admit that he must have been highly esteemed by his\r\ncontemporaries, or, at any rate, that they recognized in him the\r\nchampion of Hideyori, at whose father's hands they had received such\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE AT THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH\r\nCENTURY\r\n\r\nThe realm of Japan was then held by 214 feudatories, each having an\r\nannual income of at least 10,000 koku (omitting minor landowners).\r\nThese 214 estates yielded to their holders a total income of nearly\r\nnineteen million koku, and of that aggregate the domains of the five\r\nnoblemen forming the Board of Senior Statesmen constituted one-third.\r\nTokugawa Ieyasu was the wealthiest. His domains in the eight\r\nprovinces forming the Kwanto yielded an income of 2,557,000 koku.\r\nNext on the list came Mori Terumoto with 2,205,000 koku, and Uesugi\r\nKagekatsu with 1,200,000 koku. The latter two were partisans of\r\nIshida. But direct communication between their forces was difficult,\r\nfor while the Mori domains covered the nine provinces on the extreme\r\nwest of the main island, Uesugi's lay on the north of the Kwanto,\r\nwhence they stretched to the shore of the Japan Sea. Fourth and fifth\r\non the Board of Senior Statesmen were Maeda Toshiiye, whose fief\r\n(835,000 koku) occupied Kaga and Etchu; and Ukita Hideiye (574,000\r\nkoku), whose castle stood at Oka-yama, in Bizen. All these, except\r\nMaeda embraced the anti-Tokugawa cause of Ishida Katsushige, and it\r\nthus becomes easy to understand the desire of Ishida to win over\r\nMaeda Toshinaga, son of Toshiiye, to his camp. On the side of\r\nIeyasu's foes were also marshalled Shimazu Yoshihisa, feudal chief of\r\nSatsuma (700,000 koku); Satake Yoshinobu of Hitachi province (545,700\r\nkoku); Konishi Yukinaga in Higo (200,000 koku), who was counted one\r\nof the greatest captains of the era, and, nominally, Kohayakawa\r\nHideaki in Chikuzen (522,500 koku). With Ieyasu were the powerful\r\ndaimyo: Date Masamune of Sendai (580,000 koku); Kato Kiyomasa of\r\nKumamoto (250,000 koku); Hosokawa Tadaoki of Tango (230,000 koku);\r\nIkeda Terumasa of Mikawa (152,000 koku), and Kuroda Nagamasa of\r\nChikuzen (250,000 koku). This analysis omits minor names.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF SEKIGAHARA\r\n\r\nThe plan of campaign formed by Ishida and his confederates was that\r\nUesugi and Satake should attack the Kwanto from the north and the\r\neast simultaneously, while Mori and Ukita should move against Fushimi\r\nand occupy Kyoto. In May, 1600, Ieyasu went through the form of\r\nrequiring Uesugi to repair to Kyoto and explain his obviously\r\ndisaffected preparations. The reply sent by Uesugi was defiant.\r\nTherefore, the Tokugawa chief proceeded to mobilize his own and his\r\nallies' forces. He seems to have clearly foreseen that if he himself\r\nmoved eastward to Yedo, Momo-yama would be assaulted in his absence.\r\nBut it being necessary to simulate trust in Mori and Ukita, then\r\nnominally his supporters, he placed in Momo-yama Castle a garrison of\r\nonly two thousand men under his old and staunch friend, Torii\r\nMototada. Ieyasu planned that Uesugi should be attacked\r\nsimultaneously from five directions; namely from Sendai by Date; from\r\nKaga by Maeda; from Dewa by Mogami; from Echigo by Hori, and from\r\nHitachi by Satake. But among these five armies that of Satake\r\ndeclared for Ishida, while those of Maeda and Hori were constrained\r\nto adopt a defensive attitude by the menace of hostile barons in\r\ntheir vicinity, and thus it fell out that Date and Mogami alone\r\noperated effectively in the cause of Ieyasu.\r\n\r\nThe Tokugawa chief himself lost no time in putting his troops in\r\nmotion for Yedo, where, at the head of some sixty thousand men, he\r\narrived in August, 1600, his second in command being his third son,\r\nHidetada. Thence he pushed rapidly northward with the intention of\r\nattacking Uesugi. But at Oyama in Shimotsuke news reached him that\r\nIshida and his partisans had drawn the sword in the west, and had\r\nseized Osaka, together with the wives and families of several of the\r\ncaptains who were with Ieyasu's army. A council was immediately held\r\nand these captains were given the option of continuing to serve under\r\nIeyasu or retiring to join the western army and thus ensuring the\r\nsafety of their own families. They chose the former, and the council\r\nfurther decided that, leaving Date and Mogami to deal with Uesugi and\r\nSatake, and posting for the same purpose at Utsunomiya, Hideyasu,\r\nsecond son of Ieyasu, the main army should countermarch to meet the\r\nwestern forces at some point remote from Yedo.\r\n\r\nThe Tokugawa battalions, following two routes--the Tokaido and the\r\nNakasendo--made rapid progress westward, and on September 21st, the\r\nvan of the division under Fukushima and Ikeda reached Kiyosu. But the\r\nNakasendo column of thirty-eight thousand men under Hidetada\r\nencountered such desperate resistance before the castle of Ueda, at\r\nthe hands of Sanada Masayuki, that it did not reach Sekigahara until\r\nthe great battle was over. Meanwhile, the western army had pushed\r\nsteadily eastward. Its first exploit was to capture and burn the\r\nMomo-yama castle, which was splendidly defended by the veteran Torii\r\nMototada, then in his sixty-second year. With a garrison of only two\r\nthousand men he held at bay during eleven days an investing force of\r\nforty thousand. The torch was set to the castle on the 8th of\r\nSeptember by traitors in the garrison, and Mototada committed\r\nsuicide. Thereafter, the van of the western army advanced to Gifu\r\nalong the Nakasendo, and the main body, making a detour through Ise,\r\nultimately pushed forward into Mino.\r\n\r\nWith this army were no less than forty-three generals of renown, and\r\nthe number of feudal barons, great and small, who sent troops to\r\nswell its ranks was thirty-one. Undoubtedly these barons were\r\npartially influenced by the conception generally prevalent that the\r\nfortunes of the two great families of Toyotomi and Tokugawa depended\r\non the issue of this struggle. But it must also be admitted that had\r\nIshida Katsushige been as black as the Tokugawa historians paint him,\r\nhe could never have served for the central figure of such an array.\r\nHe is seen inciting the besiegers of Momo-yama Castle to their\r\nsupreme and successful effort. He is seen winning over to the\r\nToyotomi cause baron after baron. He is seen leading the advance of\r\nthe western army's van. And he is seen fighting to the end in the\r\ngreat battle which closed the campaign. Some heroic qualities must\r\nhave accompanied his gift of statesmanship. The nominal leader of the\r\nwestern army, which mustered 128,000 strong, was Mori Terumoto, and\r\nunder him were ranged Ukita Hideiye, Mori Hidemoto, Shimazu\r\nYoshihiro, Konishi Yukinaga, and many other captains of repute. Under\r\nthe Tokugawa banners there marched 75,000 men, their van led by Ii\r\nNaomasa and Honda Tadakatsu.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1600, the great battle of Sekigahara was fought. The\r\nstrategy on the side of the western forces was excellent. Their units\r\nwere disposed along a crescent-shaped line recessed from the enemy,\r\nso that an attacking army, unless its numerical strength was greatly\r\nsuperior, had to incur the risk of being enveloped from both\r\nflanks--a risk much accentuated by the fact that these flanking\r\ntroops occupied high ground. But on the side of the western army\r\nthere was a feature of weakness which no strategy could remove: all\r\nthe battalions constituting the right wing were pledged to espouse\r\nthe cause of Ieyasu at the crisis of the struggle. There were six of\r\nthese battalions, large or small, and they were commanded by Akakura,\r\nOgawa, Kuchiki, Wakizaka, Kohayakawa, and Kikkawa. Thus, not only\r\nwere the eastern troops able to deliver their attack in full force\r\nagainst the centre and left of their foes, but also the latter were\r\nexposed to the most demoralizing of all eventualities, treachery.\r\n\r\nAfter a fierce fight the western army was completely defeated. Some\r\naccounts put its losses at 35,000 men; others, with greater\r\nprobability, estimating that only 100,000 men were actually engaged\r\non both sides--namely, 60,000 on the Tokugawa side, and 40,000 on the\r\nToyotomi--conclude that the losses were 6000 and 9000, respectively.\r\nShimazu of Satsuma, at the head of a handful of samurai, cut his way\r\nthrough the lines of Ieyasu, and reaching Osaka, embarked hastily for\r\nKyushu. Ishida Katsushige lay concealed in a cave for a few days, but\r\nwas ultimately seized and beheaded, in company with Konishi Yukinaga\r\nand Ankokuji Ekei, at the execution ground in Kyoto. This one battle\r\nended the struggle: there was no rally. Punishment followed quickly\r\nfor the feudatories who had fought against the Tokugawa. Thus Mori\r\nTerumoto's domain, originally covering eight provinces and yielding a\r\nrevenue of 1,205,000 koku, was reduced to the two provinces of Suwo\r\nand Nagato, yielding 300,000 koku. The three provinces of Ukita\r\nHideiye were entirely forfeited, and he himself was banished to the\r\nisland Hachijoshima. Oda Hidenobu, grandson of Nobunaga, Masuda\r\nNagamori, and Sanada Masayuki, with his son, were ordered to take the\r\ntonsure and retire to the monastery of Koya-san. The fief of Uesugi\r\nKagekatsu was reduced from 1,200,000 koku in Aizu to 300,000 koku in\r\nYonezawa; and the 800,000 koku of the Satake family in Hitachi were\r\nexchanged for 200,000 koku in Akita. Only the Shimazu family of\r\nSatsuma remained without loss. Secured by inaccessibility, it\r\ncontinued to hold the provinces of Satsuma, Osumi, and Hyuga, with a\r\nrevenue of 700,000 koku.\r\n\r\nREDISTRIBUTION OF THE FIEFS\r\n\r\nThese measures represented only a fraction of the readjustments then\r\neffected. Ieyasu, following the example, set on a small scale by the\r\nTaiko, parcelled out the country in such a manner as to provide\r\nsecurity against future trouble. Dividing the feudatories into\r\nhereditary vassals (fudai no kerai) and exterior nobles (tozama), he\r\nassigned to the former small but greatly increased estates situated\r\nso as to command the main highways as well as the great cities of\r\ncentral Japan, and he located the exterior nobles--many of them with\r\nlargely reduced domains--in districts remote not only from Yedo and\r\nKyoto but also from each other, wherever such method of distribution\r\nwas possible. Moreover, in the most important places--as Osaka,\r\nFushimi, Sakai, Nagasaki, Yamada (in Ise), and Sado (the gold mines),\r\nthere were appointed administrators (bugyo), direct nominees of the\r\nTokugawa; while Kyoto was put under the sway of a deputy of the\r\nshogun (shoshidai). Again, although the tozama daimyo received\r\ntolerably munificent treatment in the matter of estates, their\r\nresources were seriously crippled by the imposition of costly public\r\nworks. These works consisted mainly of restoring dilapidated castles\r\nor building new ones on a scale so colossal as to be exceeded by only\r\nthe stronghold at Osaka. It is recorded that when Fukushima Masanori,\r\nlord of Kiyosu in Owari, complained of the crippling effects of these\r\nsevere requisitions, Kato Kiyomasa told him that there was no\r\nalternative except to retire to his castle and defy Yedo. The most\r\ncostly of the edifices that came into existence in these\r\ncircumstances was the castle of Nagoya, which is still one of the\r\nwonders of Japan. Twenty great barons took part in erecting it; the\r\nleading artists of the time were engaged in its interior decoration,\r\nand the roof of its donjon was crowned with, two gold dolphins,\r\nmeasuring nearly nine feet in height.\r\n\r\nIEYASU BECOMES SHOGUN\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of March, 1603, the Emperor nominated Ieyasu to be\r\nminister of the Right and sei-i tai-shogun, presenting to him at the\r\nsame time the conventional ox-chariot and military baton. Nine days\r\nlater, the Tokugawa chief repaired to the palace to return thanks for\r\nthese honours. The Emperor with his own hands gave him the\r\ndrinking-cup and expressed profound gratification that through his\r\nmilitary skill the wars which had convulsed the nation were ended,\r\nand the foundations of the empire's peace securely laid. Ieyasu was\r\nthen in his sixty-second year. In the following May, Hideyori was\r\nmade nai-daijin, and in the same month a marriage was contracted\r\nbetween him, then in his eleventh year, and Tenju-in, the\r\nseven-year-old daughter of Hidetada, son and successor of Ieyasu.\r\n\r\nYEDO AND KYOTO\r\n\r\nIeyasu now took up his residence at Momo-yama Castle and Hidetada was\r\nordered to live in Yedo. But the former made it a custom to go\r\neastward every autumn on the pretext of enjoying the sport of\r\nfalconry, and to remain in Yedo until the next spring. In February,\r\n1605, the Tokugawa chief's return to Kyoto from the Kwanto capital\r\nwas made the occasion of a great military display. Both Ieyasu and\r\nHidetada travelled at the same time with a following of 170,000\r\nsoldiers, who were encamped outside the city whence they marched in,\r\nten thousand daily, during seventeen consecutive days. This martial\r\nparade is said to have produced a great effect upon the nobles of the\r\nKinai and the western provinces. But Ieyasu did not long retain the\r\noffice of shogun. In 1605, he conveyed to the Imperial Court his\r\ndesire to be relieved of military functions, in favour of his son\r\nHidetada, and the Emperor at once consented, so that Hidetada\r\nsucceeded to all the offices of his father, and Ieyasu retired to the\r\ncastle of Sumpu, the capital of Suruga. His income was thenceforth\r\nreduced to 120,000 koku annually, derived from estates in the\r\nprovinces of Mino, Ise, and Omi. But this retirement was in form\r\nrather than in fact. All administrative affairs, great or small, were\r\nmanaged in Sumpu, the shogun in Yedo exercising merely the power of\r\nsanction. Ieyasu made, frequent journeys to Yedo under the pretext of\r\nhawking but in reality for government purposes.\r\n\r\nTHE YEDO BAKUFU\r\n\r\nIt was on the 30th of August, 1590, that Ieyasu made his first formal\r\nentry into Yedo from Sumpu. Yedo Castle had previously been occupied\r\nby an agent of the Hojo clan. It was very small, and its surroundings\r\nconsisted of barren plains and a few fishing villages. On the\r\nnorthwest was the moor of Musashi, and on the southeast a forest of\r\nreeds marked the littoral of Yedo Bay. The first task that devolved\r\nupon Ieyasu was the reclamation of land for building purposes. Some\r\nsubstantial work was done, yet the place did not suggest any fitness\r\nfor the purpose of an administrative centre, and not until the battle\r\nof Sekigahara placed him in command of immense resources, did Ieyasu\r\ndecide to make Yedo his capital. He then had large recourse to labour\r\nrequisitioned from the feudatories. By these means hills were\r\nlevelled, swamps reclaimed, and embankments built, so that the whole\r\naspect of the region was changed, and sites were provided for the\r\nresidences of various barons and for the establishment of shops and\r\nstores whose owners flocked to the new city from Osaka, Kyoto, and\r\nother towns. Thereafter, a castle of colossal dimensions, exceeding\r\neven the Osaka fortress in magnitude and magnificence, was rapidly\r\nconstructed, the feudatories being required to supply labour and\r\nmaterials in a measure which almost overtaxed their resources.\r\n\r\nHistorians differ as to the exact date of the establishment of the\r\nYedo Bakufu, but the best authorities are agreed that the event should\r\nbe reckoned from the battle of Sekigahara, since then, for the first\r\ntime, the administrative power came into the hand of the Tokugawa\r\nbaron, he having previously been simply the head of a board\r\ninstituted by the Taiko. There can be no doubt, that in choosing Yedo\r\nfor his capital, Ieyasu was largely guided by the example of Yoritomo\r\nand by the experience of the Ashikaga. Kamakura had been a success as\r\nsignal as Muromachi had been a failure. In the former, Ieyasu had\r\nmuch to imitate; in the latter, much to avoid. We have seen that he\r\ndistributed the estates of the feudatories so as to create a system\r\nautomatically unfavourable to disturbance, in which contrivance he\r\nborrowed and extended the ideas of Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. It remains\r\nto note that what Hojo Tokimasa and Oye Hiromoto were to Minamoto\r\nYoritomo as advisers and organizers, and what Ashikaga Tadayoshi and\r\nKono Moronao were to Ashikaga Takauji in the same roles, such, also,\r\nwere Honda Masanobu and Honda Masazumi to Tokugawa Ieyasu.\r\n\r\nHIDEYORI AND IEYASU\r\n\r\nIn May, 1605, Hideyori was nominated u-daijin. At that time the\r\nnation was divided pretty evenly into two factors; one obedient to\r\nthe Tokugawa, the other disposed to await Hideyori's coming of age,\r\nwhich event was expected to restore the authority of the Toyotomi\r\nfamily. Fukushima Masanori and Kato Kiyomasa were the most\r\nenthusiastic believers in the latter forecast. Up to that time Ieyasu\r\nhad not given any definite indication of the attitude he intended to\r\nassume towards the Taiko's heir. It was not till the year 1611 that\r\nhe found an opportunity of forming a first-hand estimate of\r\nHideyori's character. He then had a meeting with the latter at Nijo\r\nCastle, and is said to have been much struck with the bearing and\r\nintelligence of Hideyori. In fact, whereas common report had spoken\r\nin very disparaging terms of the young man's capacities--Hideyori was\r\nthen seventeen years old--the Tokugawa chief found a dignified and\r\nalert lad whose aspect suggested that if he was suffered to remain in\r\npossession of Osaka a few years longer, Yedo would run the risk of\r\nbeing relegated to a secondary place.\r\n\r\nIeyasu after that interview is said to have felt like \"a man who,\r\nhaving still a long distance to travel, finds himself enveloped in\r\ndarkness.\" He saw that the time for considering justice and humanity\r\nhad passed, and he summoned Honda Masanobu to whom he said: \"I see\r\nthat Hideyori is grown up to be a son worthy of his father. By and by\r\nit will be difficult for such a man to remain subservient to\r\nanother.\" Masanobu, whom history describes as the \"Tokugawa's\r\nstorehouse of wisdom,\" is recorded to have replied: \"So I, too,\r\nthink, but there is no cause for anxiety. I have an idea.\" What this\r\nidea was events soon disclosed. Summoning one of the officials in the\r\nservice of Hideyori's wife--Hidetada's daughter--Masanobu spoke as\r\nfollows: \"Hideyori is the only son of the late Taiko and it is the\r\ndesire of the O-gosho\" (the title given to Ieyasu after his\r\nretirement from the shogunate) \"that he, Hideyori, should have a\r\nnumerous and thriving family. Therefore, if any woman takes his\r\nfancy, she must be enrolled among his attendants to whatever class\r\nshe may belong. Moreover, if there be among these ladies any who show\r\njealousies or make disturbances, no complaint need be preferred to\r\nthe O-gosho. I will undertake to settle the matter.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time Hideyori lived among women. A word may here be said\r\nabout the marriage between Hideyori and the granddaughter of Ieyasu,\r\nthe bride and the bridegroom alike being mere children. According to\r\na recognized historical authority, writing in the Tokugawa Jidaishi,\r\nsuch marriages were inspired by one or more of the following motives:\r\n(1) that the bride or bridegroom should serve as a hostage; (2) that\r\nthe wedding should contribute to cement an alliance between the\r\nfamilies of the bride and the bridegroom; (3) that the wedding should\r\nbecome a means of spying into the affairs of one of the families; (4)\r\nthat it should be an instrument for sowing seeds of enmity between\r\nthe two families. The objects of Ieyasu in wedding his granddaughter\r\nat seven years of age to Hideyori at eleven were doubtless of the\r\nnature indicated in the third and fourth of the above definitions. On\r\nthe one hand, he seemed to the Osaka party to be conforming to the\r\nwill of the Taiko; on the other, he was able to introduce into the\r\nhousehold of Hideyori an unlimited number of spies among the retinue\r\nof his granddaughter.\r\n\r\nKATAGIRI KATSUMOTO\r\n\r\nJust before his death, Hideyoshi specially conjured Koide Hidemasa\r\nand Katagiri Katsumoto to labour for the safety of the Toyotomi\r\nfamily. Hidemasa soon followed his patron to the grave, and the duty\r\nof managing the affairs of the family devolved entirely upon\r\nKatsumoto in his capacity of administrator (bugyo). He devoted\r\nhimself to the task with the utmost sincerity and earnestness, and he\r\nmade it the basic principle of his policy to preserve harmony between\r\nthe Tokugawa and the Toyotomi. His belief was that Ieyasu had not\r\nmany years more to live, and that on his demise the administrative\r\npower would revert wholly to Hideyori as a natural consequence. Hence\r\nthe wisest course was to avoid any collision in the meanwhile.\r\n\r\nTHE OATH OF FEALTY\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May, 1601, that is to say, shortly after the battle of\r\nSekigahara, all the feudatories were invited to subscribe a written\r\noath of loyalty to the Tokugawa. This oath consisted of three\r\narticles. The first was a promise to observe strictly all\r\ninstructions issued by the Bakufu in Yedo. The second was an\r\nengagement not to harbour or protect any person who had either\r\nviolated or opposed the will of the shogun. The third was a pledge\r\nnot to give employment to any samurai reported to be a traitor or an\r\nassassin. By these stipulations the signatories swore to abide\r\nstrictly, and declared that any violation of the provisions of the\r\noath would render the violator liable to severe punishment. Among the\r\nsignatories there were not found any members of the Osaka party.\r\nThese put forward the last will of the Taiko as a reason for refusing\r\nto sign, and from that time it became evident that the situation must\r\nterminate in an armed struggle.\r\n\r\nONO HARUNAGA\r\n\r\nAmong the Osaka partisans was one called Ono Harunaga, the son of the\r\nlady Yodo's nurse. This youth led a life of great profligacy, and\r\nalthough not wanting in any of the attributes of the samurai, he\r\naltogether lacked political insight. Thus, his relations with\r\nKatsumoto were strained, and Harunaga constantly essayed to undermine\r\nKatsumoto's influence. Hideyori himself did not want for ability, but\r\nacting by the advice of his mother, Yodo, and of his friend,\r\nHarunaga, he adopted a false policy of opposition to Ieyasu.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF OSAKA\r\n\r\nThe fact that the feudatories who called themselves friends of the\r\nOsaka party had refused to sign the oath of fealty, and the fact that\r\nthe lady Yodo and Harunaga threw their influence into the\r\nanti-Tokugawa scale, had the effect of isolating Osaka so far as the\r\nlaws of the Bakufu were concerned. Men who had broken those laws or\r\notherwise offended against the shogun took refuge in Osaka. Such was\r\nthe case with the son of Hosokawa Tadaoki; with Goto Matabei, chief\r\nvassal of Kuroda Nagamasa, and with Nambu Saemon, principal retainer\r\nof Nambu Nobunao. These three and many others repaired to the castle\r\nof Osaka, and being there secure against any unarmed attempt of the\r\nTokugawa to arrest them, they virtually defied Ieyasu's control. By\r\ndegrees a constant stream of ronin, or free-lances, flowed into that\r\ncity, and a conspicuous element among its inhabitants consisted of\r\nChristian feudatories, who, regardless of the edicts of the Bakufu,\r\nopenly preached their faith and were in no wise checked by the\r\nToyotomi rulers. Even the Buddhist and Shinto priests in Osaka and\r\nits territories were independent of the Bakufu authority, and there\r\nwere cases of boundary disputes in which the Tokugawa officials\r\ndeclined to give judgment since they were not in a position to\r\nenforce it. It may well be supposed that this state of affairs grew\r\nsteadily more obnoxious to the Tokugawa. Ieyasu only awaited a\r\npretext to assert the supremacy of his authority.\r\n\r\nINSCRIPTION ON THE BELL\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that, in the year 1586, a colossal image\r\nof Buddha was erected by Hideyoshi at the Hoko-ji in Kyoto. This idol\r\nwas made of wood, and the great earthquake of 1596 destroyed it.\r\nSubsequently, Ieyasu advised Hideyori to replace the wooden idol with\r\na bronze one. Ono Harunaga stood opposed to this idea, but Katagiri\r\nKatsumoto, constant to his policy of placating Ieyasu, threw his\r\ninfluence into the other scale. It is impossible to tell whether, in\r\nmaking this proposal, Ieyasu had already conceived the extraordinary\r\nscheme which he ultimately carried out. It would appear more\r\nprobable, however, that his original policy was merely to impoverish\r\nthe Toyotomi family by imposing upon it the heavy outlay necessary\r\nfor constructing a huge bronze Buddha. Many thousands of ryo had to\r\nbe spent, and the money was obtained by converting into coin a number\r\nof gold ingots in the form of horses, which Hideyoshi had stored in\r\nthe treasury of the Osaka castle as a war fund. Five years later,\r\nthat is to say, in 1614, the great image was completed and an\r\nimposing ceremony of dedication was organized. A thousand priests\r\nwere to take part, and all the people in the capital, as well as many\r\nfrom the surrounding provinces, assembled to witness the magnificent\r\nfete. Suddenly an order was issued in the name of Ieyasu,\r\ninterdicting the consummation of the ceremony on the ground that the\r\ninscription carried by the bell for the idol's temple was designedly\r\ntreasonable to the Tokugawa. This inscription had been composed and\r\nwritten by a high Buddhist prelate, Seikan, reputed to be one of the\r\ngreatest scholars and most skilful calligraphists of his time.\r\n\r\nIt was inconceivable that such a man should err flagrantly in the use\r\nof the ideographic script. Ieyasu, however, despatched to Kyoto two\r\nrival prelates, Soden and Tengai, with instructions to convoke a\r\nmeeting of the priests of the Five Temples and invite them to express\r\nan opinion about the inscription. Soden held the post of\r\nadministrator of temples. This placed him officially at the head of\r\nall the other priests, and thus the opinions he expressed at the\r\ninstance of Ieyasu possessed special weight. It was in vain that\r\nSeikan repudiated all intention of disrespect and pointed out that\r\nthe inscription did not for a moment lend itself to the\r\ninterpretation read into it by the Tokugawa chief. Only one priest,\r\nKaizan of Myoshin-ji, had sufficient courage to oppose Soden's view,\r\nand the cause of the Tokugawa chief triumphed.\r\n\r\nWithout a full knowledge of the Chinese ideographic script it is\r\nimpossible to clearly understand either the charges preferred by the\r\nTokugawa or the arguments employed in rebuttal. Western readers may,\r\nhowever, confidently accept the unanimous verdict of all modern\r\nscholars, that the interpretation assigned to the inscription in the\r\nfirst place by the Tokugawa officials, and in the second by Hayashi\r\nDoshun, representing the Confucianists, and Soden and Tengai,\r\nrepresenting the Buddhists, was grossly unreasonable. That many\r\nexperts should be found to range themselves on the side of a ruler so\r\npowerful as Ieyasu was not wonderful, but it says little for the\r\nmoral independence of the men of the time that only one Buddhist\r\npriest among many thousand had the courage to withhold his consent to\r\na judgment which outraged truth and justice.\r\n\r\nNaturally the news of the decision threw Osaka into a state of great\r\nexcitement. Lady Yodo hastened to despatch to Sumpu her principal\r\nlady-in-waiting, Okura-no-Tsubone, accompanied by another dame of the\r\nchamber. These two were received by Acha-no-Tsubone at the court of\r\nIeyasu, and through her they conveyed fervent apologies to the\r\nTokugawa chief. Ieyasu treated the whole matter lightly. He granted\r\nan interview to the two ladies from Osaka and sent them on to Yedo to\r\nvisit the wife of Hidetada, the lady Yodo's younger sister. The Osaka\r\ndeputies naturally drew favourable inferences from this courteous\r\nmood, and taking an opportunity to refer to the affair of the\r\ninscription on the bell, elicited from Ieyasu an assurance that the\r\nmatter need not be regarded with concern.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment suspecting any deception, Okura-no-Tsubone and her\r\ncompanion took their way to Osaka. On the other hand, Honda Masanobu\r\nand the priest, Tengai, were instructed to inform Katsumoto that the\r\numbrage of Ieyasu was deeply roused, and that some very strong\r\nmeasure would be necessary to restore the Bakufu's confidence in\r\nHideyori. Katsumoto vainly sought some definite statement as to the\r\nnature of the reparation required. He was merely told to answer the\r\nquestion himself. He accordingly proposed one of three courses,\r\nnamely, that the lady Yodo should be sent to Yedo as a hostage; that\r\nHideyori should leave Osaka and settle at some other castle; or,\r\nfinally, that he should acknowledge himself a vassal of the Tokugawa.\r\nTo these proposals the only reply that could be elicited from Ieyasu\r\nwas that Yodo and her son should choose whichever course they\r\npleased, and, bearing that answer, the disquieting import of which he\r\nwell understood, Katsumoto set out from Sumpu for Osaka. Travelling\r\nrapidly, he soon overtook Okwra-no-Tsubone and explained to her the\r\nevents and their import. But the lady was incredulous. She was more\r\nready to suspect Katsumoto's sincerity than to believe that Ieyasu\r\nhad meant to deceive her.\r\n\r\nHad Katsumoto been free to continue his journey to Osaka, reaching it\r\nin advance of Okura-no-Tsubone's party, the result might have been\r\ndifferent. But Ieyasu did not contemplate any such sequence of\r\nevents. He instructed Itakura Katsushige to invite Katsumoto to call\r\nat Kyoto on the way to Osaka with the object of discussing an\r\nimportant affair. Katsumoto had no choice but to delay his journey,\r\nand Katsushige took care that the delay should be long enough to\r\nafford time for Okura-no-Tsubone's party to reach Osaka, and to\r\npresent their report, together with their suspicions of Katsumoto's\r\ndisloyalty.\r\n\r\nLady Yodo was incensed when she learned the terms that Katsumoto had\r\noffered. \"I am Hideyori's mother,\" she is reported to have cried. \"I\r\nwill never bend my knee to the Kwanto. Rather will I and my son make\r\nthis castle our death-pillow.\" Then, with Ono Harunaga, she formed a\r\nplot to kill Katsumoto and to draw the sword against the Tokugawa.\r\nSubsequently, when Katsumoto returned to Osaka and reported the\r\nresult of his mission, he stated his conviction that the only exit\r\nfrom the dilemma was one of the three courses indicated above.\r\nYodogimi, on being informed of this opinion, intimated her desire to\r\nsee Katsumoto. But when the day named for the meeting came and\r\nKatsumoto was on the point of leaving his residence for the purpose\r\nof repairing to the conference, he received information that the\r\nintention was to kill him en route. He therefore fled to his domain\r\nin the remote province of Ibaraki. It is recorded that Katsumoto's\r\nplan was to offer to send Yodo as a hostage to Yedo. Then the\r\nquestion would arise as to a place of residence for her in the\r\neastern capital, and the processes of preparing a site and building a\r\nhouse were to be supplemented by accidental conflagrations, so that\r\nthe septuagenarian, Ieyasu, might easily pass away before the actual\r\ntransfer of the hostage took place. Such was Katsumoto's device, but\r\nhe had to flee from Osaka before he could carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF OSAKA CASTLE\r\n\r\nIn the year 1614, Ieyasu issued orders for the attack of Osaka\r\nCastle, on the ground that Katsumoto's promise had not been\r\nfulfilled. The Tokugawa chief set out from Sumpu and his son,\r\nHidetada, from Yedo. Their armies, combined with the forces of\r\nseveral of the feudatories, are said to have aggregated one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand men. In Osaka, also, a great host was assembled,\r\nand among its leaders were several renowned warriors, including\r\nSanada Yukimura, Goto Matabei, Hanawa Naotsugu, and others, who,\r\nalthough not originally vassals of the Toyotomi, supported Hideyori\r\nloyally. As for the castle, its enormous strength rendered it\r\nwell-nigh impregnable, and after weeks of effort the Tokugawa forces\r\nhad nothing to show for their repeated attacks except a long list of\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nIeyasu now had recourse to intrigue. The mother of Kyogoku Takatsugu,\r\ndaimyo of Obama, in Wakasa, was the younger sister of the lady Yodo.\r\nIeyasu induced her to open communications with Yodo, and to represent\r\nto the latter the advisability of concluding peace with the Tokugawa\r\ninstead of remaining perpetually beleaguered in a fortress, thus\r\nmerely postponing an end which could not be finally averted. A\r\ncouncil was convened in the castle to consider this advice. Opinions\r\nwere divided. Some held that Ieyasu could not be believed, and that\r\nif the struggle were maintained for a few years, the face of affairs\r\nmight change radically. Others urged that the loyalty of the garrison\r\nwas not above suspicion, and that if the fight went on much longer,\r\ntreachery might be practised, to which risk a speedy peace, even at\r\nsome cost, would be preferable. Ono Harunaga was among the advocates\r\nof surrender, but Hideyori himself showed that his character had not\r\nbeen mistaken by Ieyasu. He indignantly reminded Harunaga and the\r\nlatter's fellow thinkers that arms had been taken up by their advice\r\nand in opposition to the loyal efforts of Katsumoto in the cause of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nLady Yodo, however, threw her influence into the scale with Ono\r\nHarunaga, and finally peace was concluded on terms highly favourable\r\nto the Toyotomi. It was agreed that Hideyori should remain in the\r\npossession of the castle and of all his domains, and that the\r\ngarrison, as well as the unattached samurai who formed part of it,\r\nshould not be punished but should be provided for subsequently. It\r\nmight have occurred to the leaders of the Osaka party that these\r\nlenient conditions covered some occult designs; nothing was less\r\nlikely than that a statesman like Ieyasu would be content with so\r\nsignal a failure. But a short-sighted sentiment of confidence seems\r\nto have obscured the judgment of the Osaka folks. They actually gave\r\nheed to Ieyasu's complaint that he, the o-gosho, and his son, the\r\nshogun, must not be allowed to have taken so much trouble for\r\nnothing; that it was customary to give hostages to an army which\r\nagreed to raise a siege, and that at least a portion of the castle's\r\ndefences should be destroyed. As to the last point, the Tokugawa\r\nchief was kind enough to say that the work of demolition should not\r\ncost the garrison anything, since labour would be supplied gratis by\r\nthe shoguni.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable correspondence it was agreed that Harunaga's son\r\nshould go to Yedo as a hostage, and that a portion of the outer moat\r\nof Osaka Castle should be filled up. Ieyasu did not lose a moment in\r\ngiving effect to this latter provision. He ordered some of the fudai\r\ndaimyo of the Kwanto to proceed to Osaka with several thousands of\r\nmen, who should go to work forthwith to tear down the parapets and\r\nfill up the moats of the castle. These orders were implicitly obeyed,\r\nand as Ieyasu had omitted to indicate any limit for the work of\r\ndestruction, it went on without check, and presently the second line\r\nof parapets began to follow the first. The Osaka leaders protested\r\nand essayed to stay the destruction. But the officers who were in\r\ncommand of the operation said that without a direct message from\r\nHonda Masazumi, who represented Ieyasu, they could not suspend their\r\ntask. Efforts were then made to approach Honda, but he was\r\nconveniently absent \"on account of his health,\" and the ensuing\r\ncorrespondence occupied several days, during which the pulling-down\r\nand filling-up went on by day and by night. More than one-half of the\r\nsecond moat had disappeared before Masazumi could be found. His\r\nanswer was that he had been merely told to fill up the moat. Possibly\r\nhe had mistaken the scope of his instructions and he would refer the\r\nmatter to Ieyasu. This involved further delay and more filling,\r\nuntil, finally, Masazumi acknowledged that he had made a mistake,\r\ndeclared himself prepared to undergo punishment, and withdrew his men\r\nto Fushimi.\r\n\r\nIeyasu supplied the sequel of the farce. When complaint was made\r\nagainst Masazumi, the Tokugawa leader simulated astonishment,\r\nexpressed much regret, and said that he would condemn Masazumi to\r\ncommit suicide were it permissible to mar this happy occasion by any\r\ncapital sentence. \"Peace,\" declared the astute old statesman, \"has\r\nnow been fortunately concluded. Let us not talk any more about the\r\ncastle's moats or parapets.\" Against such an attitude the Osaka men\r\ncould not enter any protest, and the farce ended there. Had the Osaka\r\nleaders possessed any measure of the wisdom that marked all the\r\ndoings of Ieyasu, they would not have suffered matters to rest at\r\nsuch a stage. But they foolishly imagined that some retaliation might\r\nbe effected by calling upon the Tokugawa to supplement that part of\r\nthe peace provisions which related to allowances for the samurai who\r\nhad fought on the side of the garrison. A demand in that sense was\r\npreferred to Ieyasu. But he had now laid aside his transient suavity.\r\nThe Osaka people were brusquely informed that they must look to the\r\nToyotomi family for recompense, and that as for rewarding unattached\r\nsamurai who had drawn the sword against the shogun, the Osaka people,\r\nwere they obedient to the dictates of loyalty, would of their own\r\naccount peremptorily reject such an unwarranted proposition, even\r\nthough Ieyasu himself were disposed to consent to it.\r\n\r\nOf course this answer profoundly enraged the Osaka party. They\r\nappreciated for the first time that they had been deceived\r\nthroughout, and that by a series of adroit manoeuvres they had been\r\nremoved from an almost impregnable position to a practically helpless\r\nplight. Not a few turned their backs on the castle, but a great\r\nmajority determined to renew the conflict and to die at their posts.\r\nThe circumstances, however, had now undergone a radical change. The\r\ncastle had been converted from the strongest fortress in Japan into a\r\nmere semblance of strength, and no garrison, however brave and\r\nhowever resolute, could have defended it successfully against the\r\nforces that the Tokugawa were able to marshal.\r\n\r\nAs for Ieyasu, he knew that his task had been immensely lightened. On\r\nthe 3rd of May, 1615, he started from Sumpu for Osaka at the head of\r\nan army numbering scarcely one-third of the force previously led\r\nagainst the castle. Nevertheless, one contingency presented itself in\r\na dangerous light. It was always possible that Hideyori himself\r\nshould make a sortie from the fortress, and, in that event, the\r\nprestige attaching to the memory of his father, Hideyoshi, might have\r\ndemoralized a large section of the Tokugawa troops. To avert this\r\ndanger, Ieyasu had recourse to his wonted methods of deception. It\r\nhas been shown that he held Harunaga's son, as a hostage. This youth\r\nwas required to write a letter to his father stating that collusion\r\nexisted between parties within and without the fortress, and that the\r\ntraitors had plotted to induce Hideyori to make a sortie, whereupon\r\nthe castle would be given up and Hideyori would be delivered into the\r\nhands of his enemies. Harunaga does not appear to have entertained\r\nany doubt as to the trustworthiness of this letter. He carried it\r\nhastily to Hideyori, who was in the act of preparing to sally out of\r\nthe castle and throw himself upon the beleaguering forces.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of the letter naturally led to a change of plan, and\r\nalthough desperate fighting subsequently took place, the castle was\r\nfinally set on fire by traitors and its fate was seen to be hopeless.\r\nHideyori's wife, granddaughter of Ieyasu, repaired to the Tokugawa\r\nheadquarters to plead for the life of her husband and his mother. But\r\nIeyasu was inexorable. He granted asylum to his granddaughter, but\r\nreplied to her prayer by ordering a renewal of the attack upon the\r\ncastle. On June 4th, Hideyori committed suicide, and his mother,\r\nYodo, was killed by one of his retainers. Some thirty men and women\r\nkilled themselves at the same time.\r\n\r\nMen spoke of the first fruitless assault upon the castle as the\r\n\"Winter Campaign,\" and of the second and successful assault as\r\nthe \"Summer Campaign.\" But the two operations were radically\r\ndifferent in their character. For, whereas in the first assault the\r\ngarrison--numbering something like one hundred and eighty thousand\r\nmen--stood strictly on the defensive, wisely relying on the immense\r\nstrength of the fortress, on the second occasion most of the fighting\r\ntook place outside the walls, the garrison preferring to rely upon\r\nstrategy and courage rather than on ruined parapets and half-filled\r\nmoats. Thus, the details of the second campaign occupy a large space\r\nin Japanese histories, but these tedious features of strategy and\r\ntactics are abbreviated here. There can be no doubt that Ieyasu, so\r\nfar from seeking to save Hideyori's life, deliberately planned his\r\ndestruction. Moreover, when it became known that an illegitimate son\r\nof Hideyori, called Kunimatsu, had been carried from the castle by\r\nsome common soldiers and secreted at a farmhouse in Fushimi, Ieyasu\r\ncaused this child of six to be seized and beheaded by a common\r\nexecutioner at Sanjo-kawara in Kyoto. This episode reflects no credit\r\nwhatever on the Tokugawa leader. That he should extirpate every scion\r\nof the Toyotomi family was not inconsistent with the canons of the\r\ntune or with the interests of his own security. But death at the\r\nhands of a common executioner ought never to have been decreed for\r\nthe son of the u-daijin, and the cruelty of the order finds no\r\nexcuse. No tenet of bushido can be reconciled with such inhumanity.\r\n\r\nTo this chapter of history belongs the attitude of Ieyasu towards the\r\nmemory of his old friend and benefactor, Hideyoshi. He caused to be\r\nlevelled with the ground the temple of Toyokuni Daimyo-jin, where the\r\nspirit of Hideyoshi was worshipped, and he ordered the removal of the\r\ntomb of the Taiko from Amidagamine to a remote corner of the Daibutsu\r\nenclosure. Finally, he sought and obtained the Emperor's sanction to\r\nrevoke the sacred title conferred posthumously on Hideyoshi. One\r\nlooks in vain for any fragment of magnanimity among such acts. Ieyasu\r\nis reported to have avowedly adopted for guidance the precept,\r\n\"Before taking any step propound to your heart the query, how about\r\njustice?\" He certainly did not put any such query to his own\r\nconscience in connexion with the castle of Osaka or its inmates.\r\n\r\nTHE GENNA YEAR-PERIOD (1615-1623)\r\n\r\nThe battle of Sekigahara is often spoken of as the last great\r\ninternecine campaign in Japanese history, but this is hardly borne\r\nout by the facts. Indeed, from what has been said above, it will be\r\nseen that Sekigahara was merely a prelude to Osaka, and that the\r\nformer stood to the latter almost in the relation of a preliminary\r\nskirmish. It is from August, 1615, that we must date the commencement\r\nof the long period of peace with which Japan was blessed under\r\nTokugawa rule. The year-name was then changed to Genna.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF IEYASU\r\n\r\nIn February, 1616, Ieyasu fell sick, and in April the Emperor sent an\r\nenvoy to confer on him the title of dajo daijin. He expired a few\r\ndays afterwards at the age of seventy-five and was apotheosized as\r\nTosho Dai-Gongen (Light of the East and Great Incarnation). He was\r\nburied on the summit of Mount Kuno in Suruga, and ultimately his\r\nashes were carried to Nikko for interment. It is recorded, though not\r\non independent authority, that when his end was drawing near he spoke\r\nto those at his side in the folio whig terms: \"My death is now in\r\nsight, but happily the country is at peace, and Hidetada has already\r\ndischarged the duties of shogun for several years. I have, therefore,\r\nno cause for anxiety. If, after I am gone, Hidetada should make any\r\nfailure in his administration of public affairs, or if he should lose\r\ncontrol of the people, any one of you to whom the Imperial order may\r\nbe addressed, should assume the functions of shogun, for, as you well\r\nknow, that post is not the property of this or that person in\r\nparticular, nor will my rest in the grave be disturbed though such an\r\nevent occurs.\"\r\n\r\nAnother record, however, represents Ieyasu as following the example\r\nof the Taiko and conjuring his most trusted retainers to devote their\r\nstrength to the support of the Tokugawa family. To Hidetada he is\r\nsaid to have suggested the advisability of compelling the daimyo to\r\nremain in Yedo for three full years after his (Ieyasu's) demise, in\r\norder to test thoroughly their attitude. Hidetada replied that while\r\nmost unwilling to reject his father's advice, his intention was to\r\nallow the feudatories to leave Yedo at once, and if any one of them\r\nevinced hostile feeling by shutting himself up in his castle, he,\r\nHidetada, would follow him thither and level his parapets with the\r\nground. Such an object lesson was, in his opinion, the best\r\nstepping-stone to supremacy. Ieyasu is reported to have received this\r\nanswer with profound satisfaction, and to have declared that he was\r\nnow assured of the permanence of peace. He then had all his sons\r\ncalled to his side and enjoined upon them the duty of serving the\r\nshogun faithfully. To his grandson, Iemitsu, he specially addressed\r\nhimself, saying: \"It will fall to your lot, some day, to govern the\r\ncountry. On that day remember that benevolence should be the first\r\nprinciple of a ruler.\"\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF IEYASU\r\n\r\nFrugality is one of the virtues which Ieyasu certainly possessed.\r\nStriking example of its display is connected with Yedo Castle. This\r\nfortress, as built originally by Ota Dokwan, was not of imposing\r\ndimensions even as a military stronghold, and the dwelling-house in\r\nthe keep presented most homely features, having a thatched roof and a\r\nporch of rough boat-planks. Yet Ieyasu was content to make this\r\nedifice his palace, and while he devoted much care to strengthening\r\nthe fortifications, he bestowed none on the enlargement and adornment\r\nof the dwelling. The system he adopted to populate the city may be\r\nsaid to have been colonial. He encouraged his vassals to settle\r\nthere, giving them lands to cultivate and breeding-grounds for\r\nhorses, so that within a brief time the city obtained numerous\r\ninhabitants and developed a prosperous condition. It was in planning\r\nthe details of all enterprises that he particularly excelled. To\r\neverything he brought an almost infinite capacity of patient study\r\nand minute examination; his principle being that to achieve success\r\nthe first desideratum is to avoid mistakes. Doubtless he owed this\r\nfaculty of profound painstaking to the vicissitudes of his early\r\nlife. The years that he passed under the control of the Imagawa and\r\nafterwards under that of Oda taught him patience and self-restraint,\r\nand made the study of literature obligatory for him, at the same time\r\nbegetting in his mind a feeling of reverence for the Buddhist faith.\r\n\r\nJapanese historians generally credit him with the virtues of\r\nhumanity, magnanimity, justice, and affability. That he was always\r\npleased to receive advice from others and that he set an example of\r\ncourtesy and zeal, there can be no doubt. Neither will anyone deny\r\nthat his resourcefulness amounted to genius. On the other hand, his\r\nrecord shows that he was unscrupulous in utilizing opportunities,\r\nwhether created by himself or made accessible by fortune, and from\r\nthe same record we are compelled to infer that he could be cruel and\r\nimplacable on occasion. His favourite sayings afford perhaps the best\r\nindex that we possess to his disposition:--\r\n\r\n   Man's life is like a long journey toiling under a heavy burden.\r\n\r\n   Never be in a hurry.\r\n\r\n   He that regards destitution as his habitual lot will never feel\r\n   the pressure of want.\r\n\r\n   When the spirit of ambition arises in your bosom, recall the\r\n   days of your distress.\r\n\r\n   To forbear is the source of harmlessness and the road to\r\n   success.\r\n\r\n   Regard anger as an enemy.\r\n\r\n   He that knows how to win only and does not know how to lose,\r\n   will achieve nothing useful.\r\n\r\n   Blame yourself and acquit others.\r\n\r\n   To fall short is better than to exceed.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SIGNATURE OF ASHIKAGA TAKAUJI\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THEATRICAL PLAY OF OLD JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD OF THE TOKUGAWA BAKUFU; FROM THE FIRST TOKUGAWA SHOGUN,\r\nIEYASU, TO THE FOURTH, IETSUNA (1603-1680)\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION\r\n\r\nTHE Tokugawa family having brought the whole empire under its sway,\r\nIeyasu applied himself to legislative work with a degree of\r\nthoroughness and earnestness that far exceeded anything in the\r\nhistory of his predecessors. The terms of the oath of allegiance that\r\nhe dictated to the feudatories after the battle of Sekigahara have\r\nbeen already referred to. Ten years later, that is to say, in 1611,\r\nhe required all the provincial governors to subscribe this same oath,\r\nand, in 1613, he enacted a law for the Court nobles (kugeshu-hatto),\r\nto which the Imperial assent was obtained. This was the first\r\ninstance of a military man legislating for the nobles of the capital;\r\nbut it must be noted that the latter by their own misconduct\r\nfurnished an opportunity for such interference. A Court scandal\r\nassumed such dimensions, in 1607, that the Emperor ordered the Bakufu\r\nto investigate the matter and to inflict suitable punishment. Ieyasu\r\nsummoned a number of the offenders to Sumpu, where he subjected\r\nfourteen of them to severe examination. Ultimately some were\r\nsentenced to exile and others were deprived of their ranks, while the\r\nprincipal malefactor, Inokuma, general of the Left, was condemned to\r\ndeath. This affair demonstrated that the effective power was in the\r\nhands of the military, and throughout the Tokugawa rule they never\r\nfailed to exercise it. In September of the year that witnessed the\r\nfall of Osaka Castle, Ieyasu and Hidetada summoned all the provincial\r\ngovernors to Momo-yama, and handed to them a body of rules entitled\r\nthe \"Laws of the Military Houses.\" These laws ran as follows:-*\r\n\r\n*The translation of these laws is taken from a paper read by Mr.\r\nConsul-General J. C. Hall and recorded in the \"Transactions of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Japan\" for 1911.\r\n\r\n\"(1) Literature, arms, archery, and horsemanship are, systematically,\r\nto be the favourite pursuits.\r\n\r\n\"Literature first, and arms next was the rule of the ancients. They\r\nmust both be cultivated concurrently. Archery and horsemanship are\r\nthe more essential for the military houses. Weapons of warfare are\r\nill-omened words to utter; the use of them, however, is an\r\nunavoidable necessity. In times of peace and good order we must not\r\nforget that disturbance may arise. Dare we omit to practise our\r\nwarlike exercise and drill?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this provision ostensibly encouraged the pursuit of literary\r\nand military arts, those who read the law too implicitly and devoted\r\nthemselves too earnestly to the pursuit of arms quickly found that\r\nthey were not in touch with the time or with the intention of the\r\nlegislators. In fact, the purpose of the latter was to bracket\r\nliterature and the art of war together, giving no preference to\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\"(2) Drinking parties and gaming amusements must be kept within due\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\n\"In our Instructions it is laid down that strict moderation in these\r\nrespects is to be observed. To be addicted to venery and to make a\r\npursuit of gambling is the first step towards the loss of one's\r\ndomain.\"\r\n\r\nThis rule may be said to define what is known in Europe as \"conduct\r\nunbecoming an officer.\" Not to know how to order one's tongue was as\r\ngrave an offence as debauchery, according to the canons of the\r\nsamurai.\r\n\r\n\"(3) Offenders against the law are not to be harboured in feudal\r\ndomains.\r\n\r\n\"Law is the very foundation of ceremonial decorum and of social order.\r\nTo infringe the law in the name of reason is as bad as to outrage\r\nreason in the name of law. To disregard the law (laid down by us) is\r\nan offence which will not be treated with leniency.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision was directly suggested by the Government's desire to\r\nsuppress Christianity.\r\n\r\n\"(4) Throughout the domains whether of the greater or lesser barons\r\n(daimyo and shomyo) or of the holders of minor benefits, if any of\r\nthe gentry or soldiers (shi and sotsu) in their service be guilty of\r\nrebellion or murder, such offenders must be at once expelled from\r\ntheir domain.\r\n\r\n\"Fellows of savage disposition (being retainers) are an apt weapon for\r\noverthrowing the domain or the family employing them, and a deadly\r\ninstrument for cutting off the common people. How can such be\r\ntolerated?\"\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Yedo Bakufu it was not uncommon for a\r\nfeudatory to enrol among his vassals refugee samurai who had blood on\r\ntheir hands. These would often be pursued into the fiefs where they\r\nhad taken refuge, and much disorder resulted. The above provision\r\nremoved these murderers from the protection of the feudatory in whose\r\nservice they had enlisted.\r\n\r\n\"(5) Henceforth no social intercourse is to be permitted outside of\r\none's own domain with the people (gentry and commoners) of another\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n\"In general, the customs of the various domains are all different from\r\none another, each having its own peculiarities. To divulge the\r\nsecrets of one's own domain is a sure indication of an intent to\r\ncurry favour.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that by the Chinese masters of strategy whose works\r\nwere studied in Japan the art of espionage was placed on a high\r\npinnacle. This teaching appears to have produced such evil results\r\nthat the Tokugawa legislated against it.\r\n\r\n\"(6) The residential castles in the domains may be repaired; but the\r\nmatter must invariably be reported. Still more imperative is it that\r\nthe planning of structural innovations of any kind must be absolutely\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\"A castle with a parapet exceeding three thousand feet by ten is a\r\nbane to a domain. Crenelated walls and deep moats (of castles) are\r\ncauses of anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision was important as a means of enfeebling the barons.\r\nThey were not at liberty to repair even a fence of the most\r\ninsignificant character or to dredge a moat, much more to erect a\r\nparapet, without previous sanction from the Bakufu.\r\n\r\n\"(7) If, in a neighbouring domain, innovations are being hatched or\r\ncliques being formed, the fact is to be reported without delay.\r\n\r\n\"Men are always forming groups; whilst, on the other hand, few ever\r\ncome to anything. On this account, they fail to follow their lords or\r\nfathers, and soon come into collision with those of neighbouring\r\nvillages. If the ancient prohibitions are not maintained, somehow or\r\nother innovating schemes will be formed.\"\r\n\r\nEverything in the form of combination, whether nominally for good or\r\nfor evil, was regarded with suspicion by the Bakufu, and all unions\r\nwere therefore interdicted. Of course, the most important incident\r\nwhich the law was intended to prevent took the form of alliances\r\nbetween barons of adjacent provinces.\r\n\r\n\"(8) Marriages must not be contracted at private convenience.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the marriage union is a result of the harmonious blending of the\r\nIn and Yo (i.e. the Yin and Yang of Chinese metaphysics, the female\r\nand male principles of nature). It is therefore not a matter to be\r\nlightly undertaken. It is said in the 'Scowling' passage of the\r\n(Chow) Book of Changes, 'Not being enemies they unite in marriage.'\r\nWhilst (the elders are) thinking of making advances to the opponent\r\n(family), the proper time (for the marriage of the young couple) is\r\nallowed to slip by. In the 'Peach Young' poem of the Book of Odes it\r\nis said, 'If the man and woman, duly observing what is correct, marry\r\nat the proper time of life, there will be no widows in the land.' To\r\nform cliques (political parties) by means of matrimonial connexions\r\nis a source of pernicious stratagems.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision was, in fact, a codification of the veto pronounced by\r\nHideyoshi on his death-bed against marriages between the families of\r\ndifferent daimyo. Ieyasu himself had been the first to violate the\r\nveto, and he was the first to place it subsequently on the statute\r\nbook. The third Tokugawa shogun, Iemitsu, extended the restriction by\r\nordering that even families having estates of only three thousand\r\nkoku should not intermarry without Yedo's previous consent.\r\n\r\n\"(9) As to the rule that the daimyo shall come (to the shogun's court\r\nat Yedo) to do service:--\r\n\r\n\"In the Shoku Nihongi (The Continuation of the Chronicles of Japan) it\r\nis recorded amongst the enactments,\r\n\r\n\"'Except when entrusted with some official duty to assemble, no one\r\n(dignitary) is allowed at his own pleasure to assemble his tribe\r\nwithin the limits of the capital, no one is to go about attended by\r\nmore than twenty horsemen, etc.'\r\n\r\n\"Hence it is not permissible to lead about a large force of soldiers.\r\nFor daimyo whose revenues range from 1,000,000 koko down to 200,000\r\nkoku, the number of twenty horsemen is not to be exceeded. For those\r\nwhose revenues are 100,000 koku and under, the number is to be in the\r\nsame proportion.\r\n\r\n\"On occasions of official service, however (i.e. in time of warfare),\r\nthe number of followers is to be in proportion to the social standing\r\nof each daimyo.\"\r\n\r\nThe above rule of repairing to the capital to pay respects\r\n(go-sankin) was an old fashion, and barons were accustomed to go with\r\nlarge retinues. Thus, it often happened that collisions occurred\r\nbetween the corteges of hostile feudatories, and it was to prevent\r\nthese sanguinary encounters that the Tokugawa set strict limits to\r\nthe number of samurai accompanying a military chief.\r\n\r\n\"(10) There must be no confusion in respect of dress uniforms, as\r\nregards the materials thereof.\r\n\r\n\"The distinction between lord and vassal, between superior and\r\ninferior, must be clearly marked by the apparel. Retainers\r\nmay not, except in rare cases by special favour of their lords,\r\nindiscriminately wear silk stuffs, such as shiro-aya (undyed silk\r\nwith woven patterns), shiro-kosode (white wadded silk coats),\r\nmurasaki-awase (purple silk coats, lined), murasaki-ura (silk coats\r\nlined with purple); nori (white gloss silk), mumon (silk coat without\r\nthe wearer's badge dyed on it), kosode (a coloured silk-wadded coat).\r\nIn recent times, retainers and henchmen (soldiers) have taken to\r\nwearing rich damasks and silk brocade. This elaborate display was not\r\nallowed by the ancient laws and it must be severely kept within\r\nbounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"(11) Miscellaneous persons are not at their pleasure to ride in\r\npalanquins.\r\n\r\n\"There are families who for special reasons from of old have\r\n(inherited) the privilege of riding in palanquins without permission\r\nfrom the authorities: and there are others who by permission of the\r\nauthorities exercise that privilege. But, latterly, even sub-vassals\r\nand henchmen of no rank have taken to so riding. This is a flagrant\r\nimpertinence. Henceforward the daimyo of the provinces, and such of\r\ntheir kinsfolk as are men of distinction subordinate to them, may\r\nride without applying for Government permission. Besides those, the\r\nfollowing have permission, viz., vassals and retainers of high\r\nposition about their lords; doctors and astrologers; persons of over\r\nsixty years of age, and sick persons and invalids. If ordinary\r\nretainers, or inferior henchmen (sotsu) are allowed to ride in\r\npalanquins, it will be considered to be the fault of their lords.\r\n\r\n\"This proviso, however, does not apply to Court nobles, abbots, or\r\necclesiastics in general.\r\n\r\n\"(12) The samurai throughout the provinces are to practise frugality.\r\n\r\n\"Those who are rich like to make a display, whilst those who are poor\r\nare ashamed of not being on a par with the others. There is no other\r\ninfluence so pernicious to social observances as this; and it must be\r\nstrictly kept in check.\"\r\n\r\nFrugality always occupied a prominent place in the Bakufu's list of\r\nessentials. Frequent and strenuous efforts were made by successive\r\nshoguns to encourage people in this virtue, but with the long peace\r\nenjoyed by the country under Tokugawa rule, a tendency to increasing\r\nluxury constantly prevailed, and the Government's aims in this\r\nrespect were not realized except for brief periods. During the\r\nadministration of the first three Tokugawa shoguns, and under the\r\neighth shogun (Yoshimune), some success attended official injunctions\r\nof economy, but on the whole a steady growth of extravagance\r\ncharacterized the era.\r\n\r\n\"(13) The lords of domain (kokushu, masters of provinces) must select\r\nmen of capacity for office.\r\n\r\n\"The way to govern is to get hold of the proper men. The merits and\r\ndemerits (of retainers) should be closely scanned, and reward or\r\nreproof unflinchingly distributed accordingly. If there be capable\r\nmen in the administration, that domain is sure to flourish; if there\r\nbe not capable men, then the domain is sure to go to ruin. This is an\r\nadmonition which the wise ones of antiquity all agree in giving\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tenor of the foregoing rules must be obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Keicho, 20th year, 7th month (September 23, 1615).\"\r\n\r\nThe above body of laws may be regarded as the Tokugawa Constitution.\r\nThey were re-enacted by each shogun in succession on assuming office.\r\nThe custom was to summon all the daimyo to Yedo, and to require their\r\nattendance at the Tokugawa palace, where, in the presence of the\r\nincoming shogun, they listened with faces bowed on the mats to the\r\nreading of the laws. Modifications and additions were, of course,\r\nmade on each occasion, but the provisions quoted above remained\r\nunaltered in their essentials. Up to the time of the third shogun\r\n(Iemitsu), the duty of reading aloud the laws at the solemn\r\nceremonial of the new shogun's investiture devolved on a high\r\nBuddhist priest, but it was thereafter transferred to the\r\nrepresentative of the Hayashi family (to be presently spoken\r\nof). Any infraction of the laws was punished mercilessly, and\r\nas their occasionally loose phraseology left room for arbitrary\r\ninterpretation, the provisions were sometimes utilized in the\r\ninterest of the shogun and at the expense of his enemies.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THE IMPERIAL COURT AND COURT NOBLES\r\n\r\nIn the same month of the same year there was promulgated a body of\r\nlaws called the \"Rules of the Imperial Court, and the Court Nobles\"\r\n(Kinchu narabi ni Kugeshu Sho-hatto). This enactment bore the\r\nsignatures of the kwampaku and the shogun and had the Imperial\r\nsanction. It consisted of seventeen articles, but only five of them\r\nhad any special importance:\r\n\r\n\"(1) Learning is the most essential of all accomplishments. Not to\r\nstudy is to be ignorant of the doctrines of the ancient sages, and an\r\nignorant ruler has never governed a nation peacefully.\"\r\n\r\nThis specious precept was not intended to be literally obeyed. The\r\nshoguns had no desire for an erudite Emperor. Their conception of\r\nlearning on the part of the sovereign was limited to the composition\r\nof Japanese verselets. A close study of the doctrines of the ancient\r\nChinese sages might have exposed the illegitimacy of the Bakufu\r\nadministration. Therefore, Yedo would have been content that the\r\nMikado should think only of spring flowers and autumn moonlight, and\r\nshould not torment his mind by too close attention to the classics.\r\n\r\n\"(2) A man lacking in ability must not be appointed to the post of\r\nregent or minister of State even though he belong to the Go-sekke\r\n(Five Designated Families), and it is needless to say that none but a\r\nmember of those families may serve in such a position.\"\r\n\r\n\"(3) A man of ability, even though he be old, shall not be allowed to\r\nresign the post of regent or minister of State in favour of another.\r\nIf he attempts to resign, his resignation should be refused again and\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe above two provisions practically conferred on the Bakufu the\r\npower of not only appointing the regent and ministers of State but\r\nalso of keeping them in office. For, as the law had been framed in\r\nYedo, in Yedo also was vested competence to judge the ability or\r\ndisability of a candidate. Hence, when the Emperor proposed to\r\nappoint a regent or a minister, the Bakufu had merely to intimate\r\nwant of confidence in the nominee's ability; and similarly, if the\r\nsovereign desired to dismiss one of those high officials, the shogun\r\ncould interfere effectually by reference to the letter of the law.\r\nThus, the power of appointing and dismissing the great officials in\r\nKyoto, which is one of the important prerogatives of the crown, was\r\npractically usurped by the shogun.\r\n\r\n\"(4) An adopted son shall always be chosen from the family of his\r\nadopter; and a female shall never be adopted to be the head of a\r\nfamily, no such custom having existed in Japan at any time.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision had two main objects. The first was to avert adoptions\r\nhaving the effect of combinations; the second, to prevent adoption of\r\nImperial princes into other families. The Bakufu sought, as far as\r\npossible, to bring about the taking of the tonsure by all princes of\r\nthe Blood who were not in the direct line of the succession, and to\r\nkeep these princes from attaining to the posts of regents or\r\nministers of State.\r\n\r\n\"(5) All reports shall be submitted to the Emperor by the regent, the\r\ndenso, or an administrator (bugyo). Any other person who, in\r\ndisregard of this rule, attempts to address the Throne direct, shall\r\nbe sent into exile, whatever his rank.\"\r\n\r\nThe denso mentioned in this provision was an official appointed by\r\nthe Bakufu for that special purpose. The whole arrangement as to\r\ncommunication with the Throne constituted a powerful buttress of\r\nBakufu influence. Generally, the latter could contrive, as has been\r\nshown above, to control the appointment and continuance in office of\r\na regent or a minister, while as for the administrators (bugyo), they\r\nwere nominees of Yedo. It thus resulted that the Throne was\r\napproachable through the channel of the Bakufu only.\r\n\r\nLAWS WITH REFERENCE TO BUDDHISM\r\n\r\nThe above laws remained unchanged throughout the Tokugawa era. A\r\nspecial law was also enacted with reference to Buddhist sects and the\r\nprincipal Buddhist temples. Ieyasu secured to these temples the\r\npossession of their manors by granting title-deeds bearing what was\r\ncalled the \"go-shuinji,\" or \"vermilion signature.\" The term was not\r\nreally applicable in the case of Ieyasu. It is true that Hideyoshi,\r\ndoubtless in imitation of Chinese custom, stamped a vermilion seal\r\nupon documents of this character; but the Tokugawa shoguns employed a\r\nblack signature written with a pen. Nevertheless, the term\r\n\"go-shuinji\" continued to be used from the time of the Taiko\r\ndownwards. It was an outcome of Ieyasu's astuteness that the great\r\nHongwan temple was divided into two branches, eastern and western, by\r\nwhich process its influence was prevented from becoming excessive.\r\nDuring the administration of the third shogun, every daimyo was\r\nrequired to adhere to a definite sect of Buddhism, and to the\r\nBuddhist and Shinto temples was entrusted the duty of keeping an\r\naccurate census of their parishioners. The direct purpose of these\r\nlatter laws was to facilitate the extermination of Christianity.\r\nAnyone whose name was not enrolled on one of the above lists fell\r\nunder suspicion of embracing the foreign faith.\r\n\r\nA JAPANESE HISTORIAN'S OPINION\r\n\r\nReferring to the above laws the Tokugawa Jidaishi says:\r\n\r\n\"The above laws and regulations were the Constitution of the Tokugawa\r\nBakufu. By the aid of their provisions the influence of Yedo was\r\nextended to every part of the nation from the Imperial Court to the\r\nworld of religion. No such codes had ever previously existed in\r\nJapan. Any unit of the nation, whether a Court noble, a great\r\nfeudatory, a priest, or a common samurai, had to yield implicit\r\nobedience or to suffer condign punishment. Thus, it fell out that\r\neverybody being anxious to conform with the rules, the universal\r\ntendency was to share in preserving the peace. From the point of view\r\nof this system, Ieyasu was eminently above all modern and ancient\r\nheroes. Hideyoshi won brilliant victories in war, but he saw no\r\nbetter method of maintaining peace at home than to send the country's\r\narmies to fight abroad. He seems to have conceived a hope that his\r\ngenerals would find goals for their ambition in Korea or China, and\r\nwould exhaust their strength in endeavouring to realize their dreams.\r\nBut his plan brought about the contrary result; for the generals\r\nformed fresh enmities among themselves, and thus the harvest that was\r\nsubsequently reaped at Sekigahara found hands to sow it.\r\n\r\n\"Ieyasu, however, prized literature above militarism. He himself\r\nbecame a pioneer of learning, and employed many scholars to assist in\r\nconstructing a solid framework of peace. The territorial nobles had\r\nto follow his example. Even Kato Kiyomasa, Asano Yukinaga, and Kuroda\r\nNagamasa, each of whom during his lifetime was counted a divinely\r\ninspired general, found themselves constrained to study the Chinese\r\nclassics under the guidance of Funabashi Hidekata and Fujiwara\r\nSeigwa. How much more cogent, then, was the similar necessity under\r\nwhich lesser men laboured. Thus, Ieyasu's love of literature may be\r\nregarded as a cause of the peace that prevailed under the Tokugawa\r\nfor 260 years.\"\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF LEARNING\r\n\r\nIeyasu employed four instruments for educational purposes--the\r\nestablishment of schools, the engagement of professors, the\r\ncollection of ancient literary works, and the printing of books. In\r\naccordance with his last will his son Yoshinao, daimyo of Owari,\r\nbuilt, in 1636, the Daiseiden College beside the temple of Kiyomizu\r\nin Ueno Park, near the villa of Hayashi Kazan, the celebrated\r\nConfucian scholar; but, in 1691, the college was moved to the slope\r\ncalled Shohei-zaka, where a bridge--Shohei-bashi--was thrown across\r\nthe river. \"Shohei\" is the Japanese pronunciation of \"Changping,\"\r\nConfucius's birthplace, and the school was known as the Shohei-ko. It\r\nreceived uniform patronage at the hands of the Tokugawa, whose\r\nkinsmen and vassals were required to study there, their proficiency,\r\nas determined by its examinations, being counted a passport to\r\noffice. Yoshinao laid the foundation of a great library at the school\r\nand the number of volumes was constantly increased.\r\n\r\nDuring the lifetime of Ieyasu, one of the most noted scholars was\r\nFujiwara Seigwa. By the invitation of the Tokugawa chief he lectured\r\non the classics in Kyoto, and it is recorded that Ieyasu, who had\r\njust (1600) arrived in that city, attended one of these lectures,\r\nwearing his ordinary garments. Seigwa is related to have fixed his\r\neyes on Ieyasu and addressed him as follows: \"The greatest work of\r\nConfucius teaches that to order oneself is the most essential of\r\nachievements. How shall a man who does not order himself be able to\r\norder his country? I am lecturing on ethics to one who behaves in a\r\ndisorderly and discourteous manner. I believe that I preach in vain.\"\r\nIeyasu immediately changed his costume, and the event contributed\r\nmaterially to the reputation alike of the intrepid teacher and of the\r\nmagnanimous student, as well as to the popularity of Seigwa's\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nHayashi Kazan was a disciple of Seigwa whose reputation as a scholar\r\nhe rivalled. Ieyasu employed him extensively in drafting laws; and\r\nmany of his disciples subsequently served as teachers of the Chinese\r\nclassics. The scripture of Hayashi's school of ethics was Chu Hi's\r\ncommentary on the \"Great Learning\" of Confucius. In this system,\r\nethics become a branch of natural philosophy. \"Corresponding to the\r\nregular change of the seasons in nature is right action in man (who\r\nis the crown of nature), in the relation of sovereign and subject,\r\nparent and child, elder brother and younger brother, husband and\r\nwife, friend and friend. To his sovereign, or lord, he is bound to be\r\nfaithful; to his parents, dutiful, and to his elder brother,\r\nrespectful. Affection should characterize the relations of husband\r\nand wife and trust those of friend with friend.\"\r\n\r\nA moment's consideration of this ethical system shows that it cannot\r\nbe reconciled with such a form of administration as that existing\r\nunder the Bakufu. Genuine loyalty to the sovereign found no place in\r\nthe practical code of Tokugawa. Whether Ieyasu appreciated that fact\r\nor whether he ignored it in consideration of the civilizing and\r\ntranquillizing influences of Confucianism, there is nothing to show.\r\nUltimately, however, it was to the ethics of the Chinese sage that\r\nthe Tokugawa downfall became indirectly attributable.\r\n\r\nIeyasu showed much earnestness in searching for and collecting\r\nancient books. Before and after the war of Osaka, he ordered\r\npriests to copy old books and records preserved in Buddhist\r\ntemples and noblemen's houses. Subsequently, during the Kwanei\r\nera--1621-1643--there was built within the castle of Yedo a library\r\ncalled Momijiyama Bunko where the books were stored. He was also\r\ninstrumental in causing the compilation and publication of many\r\nvolumes whose contents contribute materially to our historical\r\nknowledge. The writing of history in the Imperial Court had been\r\nabandoned for many years, and the scholars employed by Ieyasu had\r\nrecourse to private diaries for materials. Hayashi Kazan (Doshuri)\r\nwas entrusted with the duty of distinguishing between the true and\r\nthe false in using these records, and there resulted two memorable\r\nworks. The second of these consisted in the main of genealogical\r\ntables. It extended to 372 volumes and subsequently became the Kwanei\r\nShoke Keizu-den. The first, a national history, was originally called\r\nthe Honcho Hennen-roku. Before its compilation Kazan (Doshun) died,\r\nand the book was concluded by his son, Harukatsu, in the year 1635.\r\nIt consisted of three hundred volumes in all, and covered the period\r\nfrom the age of the Gods to the year 1610. It is now known as the\r\nHoncho Tsugan. The two works having been published to the order and\r\nunder the patronage of the Bakufu, their contents were by no means\r\nfree from the stain of favour and affection, but they nevertheless\r\npossess inestimable historical value.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND TOKUGAWA SHOGUN, HIDETADA\r\n\r\nHidetada, third son of Ieyasu, was born in 1579; succeeded to the\r\nshogunate in 1605; abdicated in 1622, and died in 1632. His\r\nappearance on the historical stage was not very glorious, for, as\r\nalready shown, when marching to join his father's army before the\r\nbattle of Sekigahara, he allowed himself to be detained so long at\r\nthe siege of Ueda Castle that he failed to be present at the great\r\ncombat, and Ieyasu, as a mark of displeasure, refused to meet him\r\nuntil Honda Masazumi pleaded Hidetada's cause. During the first\r\neleven years of his shogunate he exercised little real authority, the\r\nadministration being conducted by Ieyasu himself from his nominal\r\nplace of retirement in Sumpu. Thus, the period of Hidetada's\r\nindependent sway extended over six years only. But during the ten\r\nsubsequent years he continued to exercise much camera influence over\r\nthe Government, though his power was inferior to that which had been\r\nwielded by Ieyasu in nominal retirement. Honda Masazumi, who had\r\nbefriended him at the critical time mentioned above, occupied the\r\nhighest post in the administration, the second place being assigned\r\nto Sakai Tadayo, while in Kyoto the Tokugawa interests were guarded\r\nby Itakura Katsushige and Matsudaira Masatsuna.\r\n\r\nThe era of Hidetada was essentially one of organization, and by the\r\nexercise of sincerity and justice he contributed much to the\r\nstability of the Tokugawa rule. Not the least memorable step taken by\r\nhim related to the fortress of Yedo. In the year following his\r\nsuccession, he ordered the feudatories of the east to construct the\r\ncastle which remains to this day one of the marvels of the world.\r\n\"Around it stretched a triple line of moats, the outermost measuring\r\nnine and a half miles in length, the innermost one and a half, their\r\nscarps constructed with blocks of granite nearly as colossal as those\r\nof the Osaka stronghold, though in the case of the Yedo fortification\r\nevery stone had to be carried hundreds of miles over the sea. The\r\ngates were proportionately as huge as those at Osaka, well-nigh the\r\nmost stupendous works ever undertaken, not excepting even the\r\nPyramids of Egypt. There is not to be found elsewhere a more striking\r\nmonument of military power, nor can anyone considering such a work,\r\nas well as its immediate predecessor, the Taiko's stronghold at\r\nOsaka, and its numerous contemporaries of lesser but still striking\r\nproportions in the principal fiefs, refuse to credit the Japanese\r\nwith capacity for large conceptions and competence to carry them into\r\npractice.\"\r\n\r\nCONJUGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE IMPERIAL FAMILY AND THE TOKUGAWA\r\n\r\nIt had been one of the most cherished wishes of Ieyasu to follow the\r\nFujiwara precedent by establishing conjugal relations between the\r\nImperial family and the Tokugawa. But the ex-Emperor, Go-Yozei,\r\nturned a deaf ear to this proposal on the ground that a lady born in\r\na military house had never been chosen consort of a sovereign.\r\nIeyasu, however, did not abandon his purpose. He entrusted its\r\nprosecution to Todo Takatora, and in 1616, the year of Ieyasu's\r\ndeath, Todo induced Konoe Nobuhiro, minister of the Right, to promote\r\nthis undertaking. Nobuhiro, being the Emperor's younger brother, was\r\nable to exert much influence, and finally the ex-Emperor gave his\r\nconsent. In June, 1620, Kazuko, daughter of Hidetada, became first\r\nlady-in-waiting, and ultimately Empress under the name of\r\nTofuku-mon-in. It is recorded that 1180 chests were required to carry\r\nher trousseau from Yedo, and that the costs of her outfit and of her\r\njourney to Kyoto aggregated more than a million sterling. She gave\r\nbirth to two princes and five princesses, and the house of Konoe,\r\nwhich had been instrumental in procuring her summons to the Court,\r\nbecame the leader of the Go-sekke.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF HIDETADA AND HIS CHARACTER\r\n\r\nAfter resigning the shogunate in 1622, Hidetada retired to the inner\r\ncastle (Nishi Maru) in Yedo and there continued to direct affairs. He\r\ndied ten years later, at the age of fifty-eight, and was interred at\r\nthe temple Zojo-ji, in the Shiba district of the eastern capital.\r\nJapanese historians agree that Hidetada's character was adapted for\r\nthe work of consolidation that fell to his lot. He resembled his\r\nfather, Ieyasu, in decision and perseverance; he never dealt lightly\r\nwith any affair, and while outwardly gentle and considerate, he was\r\nat heart subtle and uncompromising. An interesting illustration of\r\nthe administrative canons of the time is afforded in the advice said\r\nto have been given by Hosokawa Tadaoki when consulted by Hidetada.\r\n\"There is an old proverb,\" Tadaoki replied, \"that if a round lid be\r\nput on a square vessel, those within will have ease; but if a square\r\nlid be used to cover a square vessel, there will result a feeling of\r\ndistress.\" Asked for a standard by which to judge qualifications for\r\nsuccess, the same nobleman answered that an oyster shell found on the\r\nAkashi shore is the best type of a man qualified to succeed, for the\r\nshell has been deprived of all its angles by the beating of the\r\nwaves. Of Hidetada himself there is told an anecdote which shows him\r\nto have been remarkably free from superstition. A comet made its\r\nappearance and was regarded with anxiety by the astrologists of\r\nKyoto, who associated its advent with certain misfortune. Hidetada\r\nridiculed these fears. \"What can we tell,\" he said, \"about the\r\nsituation of a solitary star in the wide universe, and how can we\r\nknow that it has anything to do with this little world?\"\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD SHOGUN, IEMITSU\r\n\r\nIemitsu, son of Hidetada, was born in 1603; succeeded to the\r\nshogunate in 1622, and held that post until his death, in 1651. His\r\nprincipal ministers were Ii Naotaka (who had occupied the post of\r\npremier since the days of Ieyasu), Matsudaira Nobutsuna, and Abe\r\nTadaaki, one of the ablest officers that served the Tokugawa. He\r\ndevoted himself to consolidating the system founded by his\r\ngrandfather, Ieyasu, and he achieved remarkable success by the\r\nexercise of exceptional sagacity and determination. In 1626, he\r\nproceeded to Kyoto at the head of a large army, simply for the\r\npurpose of conveying to the feudal nobles a significant intimation\r\nthat he intended to enforce his authority without hesitation. Up to\r\nthat, time the feudal chiefs were not officially required to reside\r\nin Yedo for any fixed time or at any fixed interval. But now it was\r\nclearly enacted that the feudatories of the east and those of the\r\nwest should repair to the Bakufu capital, at different seasons in the\r\nyear; should remain there a twelvemonth,--in the case of feudal lords\r\nfrom the Kwanto only six months--and should leave their wives and\r\nfamilies as hostages during the alternate period of their own absence\r\nfrom the shogun's city, which they spent in the provinces.\r\n\r\nThis system was technically called sankin kotai, that is \"alternate\r\nresidence in capital.\" From the point of view of the Tokugawa the\r\nplan was eminently wise, for it bound the feudal chiefs closer to the\r\nshogun, keeping them under his eye half the time and giving hostages\r\nfor their good behaviour the other half; and it helped the growth of\r\nYedo both in financial and political power, by bringing money into it\r\nand by making it more than before an administrative headquarters. On\r\nthe other hand there was a corresponding drain on the provinces, all\r\nthe greater since the standard of living at Yedo was higher than in\r\nrural districts and country nobles thus learned extravagance. To\r\nprevent other families from growing too rich and powerful seems to\r\nhave been a part of Ieyasu's definite plan for holding in check\r\npossible rivals of the Tokugawa, so that it is not impossible that he\r\nforesaw this very result. At any rate it is known that in the\r\ninstructions for government which he handed down to his successors he\r\nurged them to keep strict surveillance over their feudal lords and if\r\nany one of them seemed to be growing rich to impose upon him such a\r\nburden of public works as would cripple him.\r\n\r\nIn 1632, Iemitsu made another military demonstration at Kyoto, and on\r\nthis occasion the Emperor would have conferred on him the post of\r\nprime minister (dajo daijiri). But he refused to accept it. This\r\nrefusal was subsequently explained as a hint to the feudal chiefs\r\nthat inordinate ambition should be banished from their bosoms; but in\r\nreality Iemitsu was influenced by the traditional principle that the\r\nThrone had no higher gift to bestow on a subject than the shogunate.\r\n\r\nPROMINENT FEATURES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF IEMITSU\r\n\r\nThe prominent feature of this able ruler's administration was that he\r\nthoroughly consolidated the systems introduced by his grandfather and\r\nconfirmed by his father. From the time of Iemitsu downwards, cardinal\r\nforms were never changed, alterations being confined to\r\nnon-essentials. On his death-bed he desired that his prime minister,\r\nHotta Masamori, and several other notables should accompany him to\r\nthe tomb, and on the night of the 10th of June, 1651, Hotta Masamori\r\n(aged forty-six), Abe Shigetsugu (aged fifty-two), Uchida Masanobu\r\n(aged thirty-three), Masamori's mother (aged sixty-three), Saegusa\r\nMoriyoshi, and Okuyama Yasushige all committed suicide. Their tombs\r\nstand to this day in Nikko.\r\n\r\nTHE NIKKO SHRINE AND THE KWANEI TEMPLE\r\n\r\nIt has been related how largely Ieysau was aided against the Osaka\r\nparty by Tengai, abbot of Enryaku-ji. This priest it was that devised\r\nthe singular accusation connected with the inscription on a bell at\r\nHoko-ji. He received from Ieyasu the diocese of Nikko in Shimotsuke\r\nprovince, where he built a temple which ultimately served as the\r\nshrine of Ieyasu. But the first Tokugawa shogun, faithful to his\r\nfrugal habits, willed that the shrine should be simple and\r\ninexpensive, and when Hidetada died, his mausoleum (mitamaya) at the\r\ntemple Zojo-ji in Yedo presented by its magnificence such a contrast\r\nto the unpretending tomb at Nikko, that Iemitsu ordered Akimoto\r\nYasutomo to rebuild the latter, and issued instructions to various\r\nfeudal chiefs to furnish labour and materials. The assistance of even\r\nKorea, Ryukyu, and Holland was requisitioned, and the Bakufu treasury\r\npresented 700,000 ryo of gold. The shrine was finished in 1636 on a\r\nscale of grandeur and artistic beauty almost unsurpassed in any other\r\ncountry. The same priest, Tengai, was instrumental in building the\r\ntemple known as Kwanei-ji, and at his suggestion, Hidetada asked the\r\nImperial Court to appoint a prince to the post of abbot (monsu).\r\n\r\nThis system already existed in the case of Enryaku-ji on Hiei-zan in\r\nKyoto, and it was Tengai's ambition that his sect, the Tendai, should\r\npossess in Yedo a temple qualified to compete with the great\r\nmonastery of the Imperial capital. Thus, Ueno hill on which the Yedo\r\nstructure stood was designated \"Toei-zan,\" as the site of the Kyoto\r\nmonastery was designated \"Hiei-zan,\" and just as the temple on the\r\nlatter received the name of \"Enryaku-ji,\" after the era of its\r\nconstruction (Enryaku), so that in Yedo was named \"Kwanei-ji,\" the\r\nname of the year period of its foundation being Kwanei. Finally, the\r\nKwanei-ji was intended to guard the \"Demon's Gate\" of the Bakufu city\r\nas the Enryaku-ji guarded the Imperial capital. Doubtless, in\r\nfurthering this plan, Iemitsu had for ultimate motive the association\r\nof an Imperial prince with the Tokugawa family, so that in no\r\ncircumstances could the latter be stigmatized as \"rebels.\" Not until\r\nthe day of the Tokugawa's downfall did this intention receive\r\npractical application, when the priest-prince of Ueno (Prince\r\nKitashirakawa) was set up as their leader by the remnants of the\r\nBakufu army.\r\n\r\nISE AND NIKKO\r\n\r\nThrough many centuries it had been the custom of the Imperial Court\r\nto worship at the great shrine of Ise and to offer suitable gifts.\r\nThis ceremony was long suspended, however, on account of continuous\r\nwars as well as the impecunious condition of the Court. Under the\r\nsway of the Oda and the Toyotomi, fitful efforts were made to renew\r\nthe custom, but it was left for the Tokugawa to re-establish it. The\r\nthird shogun, Iemitsu, petitioned the Court in that sense, and\r\nassigned an estate in Yamashiro as a means of defraying the necessary\r\nexpenses, the Fujinami family being appointed to perform the ceremony\r\nhereditarily. At the same time Iemitsu petitioned that the Court\r\nshould send an envoy to worship at Nikko every year on the\r\nanniversary of the death of Ieyasu, and this request having been\r\ngranted, Nikko thenceforth became to the Tokugawa what Ise was to the\r\nImperial Court.\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the Shimabara revolt finally induced the\r\nBakufu Government to adopt the policy of international seclusion and\r\nto extirpate Christianity. In carrying out the latter purpose,\r\nextensive recourse was had to the aid of Buddhism. The chief temple\r\nof each sect of that religion was officially fixed, as were also the\r\nbranch temples forming the parish of the sect; every unit of the\r\nnation was required to register his name in the archives of a temple,\r\nand the Government ordered that the priests should keep accurate\r\nlists of births and deaths. Anyone whose name did not appear on these\r\nlists was assumed to belong to the alien faith. This organization was\r\ncompleted in the time of Iemitsu.\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH SHOGUN, IETSUNA\r\n\r\nIetsuna, the fourth Tokugawa shogun, eldest son of Iemitsu, was born\r\nin 1642 and succeeded to the office in 1651, holding it until his\r\ndeath in 1680. In bequeathing the administrative power to a youth in\r\nhis tenth year, Iemitsu clearly foresaw that trouble was likely to\r\narise. He therefore instructed his younger brother, Hoshina Masayuki,\r\nbaron of Aizu, to render every assistance to his nephew, and he\r\nappointed Ii Naotaka to be prime minister, associating with him Sakai\r\nTadakatsu, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, Abe Tadaaki, and other statesmen of\r\nproved ability. These precautions were soon seen to be necessary, for\r\nthe partisans of the Toyotomi seized the occasion to attempt a coup.\r\nThe country at that time swarmed with ronin (wave-men); that is to\r\nsay, samurai who were, for various reasons, roving free-lances. There\r\nseems to have been a large admixture of something very like European\r\nchivalry in the make up of these ronin, for some of them seem to have\r\nwandered about merely to right wrongs and defend the helpless. Others\r\nsought adventure for adventure's sake and for glory's, challenging\r\nthe best swordsman in each place to which they came. Many seem to\r\nhave taken up the lives of wanderers out of a notion of loyalty; the\r\nfeudal lords to whom they had owed allegiance had been crushed by the\r\nTokugawa and they refused to enter the service of the shogun.\r\n\r\nThe last-named reason seems to have been what prompted the revolt of\r\n1651, when Ietsuna, aged ten, had just succeeded in the shogunate his\r\nfather Iemitsu who had exalted the power of the Tokugawa at the\r\nexpense of their military houses. The ronin headed by Yui Shosetsu\r\nand Marubashi Chuya plotted to set fire to the city of Yedo and take\r\nthe shogun's castle. The plot was discovered. Shosetsu committed\r\nsuicide, and Chuya was crucified. In the following year (1652)\r\nanother intrigue was formed under the leadership of Bekki Shoetnon,\r\nalso a ronin. On this occasion the plan was to murder Ii Naotaka, the\r\nfirst minister of State, as well as his colleagues, and then to set\r\nfire to the temple Zojo-ji on the occasion of a religious ceremony.\r\nBut this plot, also, was discovered before it matured, and it proved\r\nto be the last attempt that was made to overthrow the Bakufu by force\r\nuntil more than two hundred years had passed.\r\n\r\nTHE LEGISLATION OF IEMITSU AND IETSUNA\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of August, 1635, a body of laws was issued by Iemitsu\r\nunder the title of Buke Sho-hatto, and these laws were again\r\npromulgated on June 28, 1665, by the fourth shogun, Ietsuna, with a\r\nfew alterations. The gist of the code of Iemitsu was as follows: That\r\nliterature and arms were to be the chief object of cultivation; that\r\nthe great and small barons were to do service by turns in Yedo,\r\nstrict limits being set to the number of their retainers; that all\r\nwork on new castles was strictly interdicted, and that all repairs of\r\nexisting castles must not be undertaken without sanction from the\r\nYedo administration; that in the event of any unwonted occurrence,\r\nall barons present at the scene must remain and await the shogun's\r\norders; that no person other than the officials in charge might be\r\npresent at an execution; that there must be no scheming innovations,\r\nforming of parties, or taking of oaths; that private quarrels were\r\nstrictly interdicted, and that all matters difficult of arrangement\r\nmust be reported to the Yedo administration; that barons having an\r\nincome of ten thousand koku or more, and their chief officials, must\r\nnot form matrimonial alliances without the shogun's permission; that\r\ngreater simplicity and economy must be obeyed in social observances,\r\nsuch as visits of ceremony, giving and receiving presents,\r\ncelebrating marriages, entertaining at banquets, building residences,\r\nand general striving after elegance; that there must be no\r\nindiscriminate intermingling (of ranks); that, as regards the\r\nmaterials of dress, undyed silk with woven patterns (shiro aya) must\r\nbe worn only by Court nobles (kuge) and others of the highest ranks;\r\nthat wadded coats of undyed silk might be worn by daimyo and others\r\nof higher rank; that lined coats of purple silk, silk coats with the\r\nlining of purple, white gloss silk, and coloured silk coats without\r\nthe badge were not to be worn at random; that coming down to\r\nretainers, henchmen, and men-at-arms, the wearing by such persons of\r\nornamental dresses such as silks, damask, brocade, or embroideries\r\nwas quite unknown to the ancient laws, and a stop must be put to it;\r\nthat all the old restrictions as to riding in palanquins must be\r\nobserved; that retainers who had a disagreement with their original\r\nlord were not to be taken into employment by other daimyo; that if\r\nany such was reported as having been guilty of rebellion or homicide,\r\nhe was to be sent back (to his former lord); that any who manifests a\r\nrefractory disposition must either be sent back or expelled; that\r\nwhere the hostages given by sub-vassals to their mesne lords had\r\ncommitted an offence requiring punishment by banishment or death, a\r\nreport in writing of the circumstances must be made to the\r\nadministrators' office and their decision awaited; that in case the\r\ncircumstances were such as to necessitate or justify the instant\r\ncutting-down of the offender, a personal account of the matter must\r\nbe given to the administrator; that lesser feudatories must honestly\r\ndischarge the duties of their position and refrain from giving\r\nunlawful or arbitrary orders (to the people of their fiefs); that\r\nthey must take care not to impair the resources or well-being of the\r\nprovince or district in which they are; that roads, relays of\r\npost-horses, boats, ferries, and bridges must be carefully attended\r\nto, so as to ensure that there should be no delays or impediments to\r\nquick communication; that no private toll-bars might be erected or\r\nany existing ferry discontinued; that no vessels of over five hundred\r\nkoku burden were to be built; that the glebe lands of shrines and\r\ntemples scattered throughout the provinces, having been attached to\r\nthem from ancient times to the present day, were not to be taken from\r\nthem; that the Christian sect was to be strictly prohibited in all\r\nthe provinces and in all places; that in case of any unfilial conduct\r\nthe offender should be dealt with under the penal law; that in all\r\nmatters the example set by the laws of Yedo was to be followed in all\r\nthe provinces and places.\r\n\r\nAs has been noted above, this same body of laws was re-enacted under\r\nthe authority of Ietsuna, with the following slight alterations,\r\nnamely, that the veto was removed from the wearing of costly\r\nornamented dresses by retainers, henchmen, and men-at-arms, and that\r\nthe restriction as to size should not apply to a cargo vessel. At the\r\nsame time a prohibition of junshi (following in death) was issued in\r\nthese terms:\r\n\r\n\"That the custom of following a master in death is wrong and\r\nunprofitable is a caution which has been at times given from of old;\r\nbut owing to the fact that it has not actually been prohibited, the\r\nnumber of those who cut their belly to follow their lord on his\r\ndecease has become very great. For the future, to those retainers who\r\nmay be animated by such an idea, their respective lords should\r\nintimate, constantly and in very strong terms, their disapproval of\r\nthe custom. If, notwithstanding this warning, any instance of the\r\npractice should occur, it will be deemed that the deceased lord was\r\nto blame for unreadiness. Henceforward, moreover, his son and\r\nsuccessor will be held blameworthy for incompetence, as not having\r\nprevented the suicides.\"*\r\n\r\n*From a paper read by Mr. Consul-General J. C. Hall and recorded in\r\nthe \"Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan\" for 1911.\r\n\r\nRELEASE OF HOSTAGES\r\n\r\nAnother memorable step was taken during the administrative period of\r\nIetsuna. It had been the custom to require that all the great nobles\r\nshould send a number of their chief retainers or the latter's\r\nfathers, brothers, and sons to Yedo, where they were held as hostages\r\nfor the peaceful conduct of their feudal chiefs. But when the system\r\nof sankin kotai had been in operation for some time, and when the\r\npower of the Tokugawa Bakufu had been fully consolidated, this\r\npractice of exacting hostages became superfluous and vexatious. It\r\nwas therefore abandoned in the year 1665 and the hostages were all\r\nsuffered to leave Yedo.\r\n\r\nTHE MING DYNASTY\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Ming dynasty in China took place in the thirteenth\r\nyear of Ietsuna's succession, and for a moment it seemed that Japan\r\nmight possibly take the field against the conquering Tatars. A\r\nChinese immigrant who had settled in the island of Hirado, in Hizen,\r\nmarried the daughter of a Japanese farmer, and had a son by her. The\r\nimmigrant's name was Cheng Chi-lung, and when the partisans of the\r\nMing dynasty made their last stand at Foochaw, they chose Cheng for\r\ngeneral, through him soliciting aid from the Yedo Bakufu. Their\r\nrequest was earnestly discussed in Yedo, and it is possible that had\r\nthe Ming officers held out a little longer, Japan might have sent an\r\nexpedition across the sea. Cheng Chi-lung's son, Cheng Cheng-kung,\r\nresisted to the last, and when he fell fighting at Macao, his\r\nJapanese mother committed suicide. Other fugitives from China,\r\nnotably an able scholar named Chu Chi-yu, settled in Japan at this\r\ntime, and contributed not a little to the promotion of art and\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nYEDO\r\n\r\nThe influence of the sankin kotai system upon the prosperity of Yedo,\r\nas well as upon the efficiency of the Tokugawa administration, has\r\nalready been noticed. Indeed, Yedo in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury was one of the most populous and prosperous cities in the\r\nworld. But very little intelligence had been exercised in planning\r\nit. The streets were narrow and there were no bridges across the main\r\nriver. Thus, in 1657, a fire broke out which, being fanned by a\r\nviolent wind, burned for two days, destroying the greater part of the\r\ncity together with the residences of nearly all the daimyo. The\r\ncalamity occurred in the month of February and was accompanied by a\r\nviolent snowstorm, which greatly increased the sufferings of the\r\ncitizens. Tradition says that 108,000 persons lost their lives, but\r\nthat number is probably an exaggeration. In the following year,\r\nanother similar catastrophe occurred on almost the same scale, and it\r\nseemed as though Yedo could never rise from its ashes. Yet the result\r\nof these calamities was salutary. The Bakufu selected suitable\r\nsituations for the residences of the daimyo, and issued a law\r\nrequiring that the main thoroughfares must have a width of sixty feet\r\nand even the by-streets must not be narrower than from thirty to\r\nthirty-six feet. Moreover, three bridges, namely, the Ryogoku, the\r\nEitai, and the Shin-o, were thrown across the Sumida. This river,\r\nwhich formed the eastern boundary of the city, had hitherto been left\r\nunbridged for military reasons, and the result was that on the\r\noccasion of the great conflagration thousands of people, caught\r\nbetween the flames and the river bank, had to choose death by burning\r\nor by drowning. Nevertheless, some officials opposed the building of\r\nbridges, and were only silenced by the astute remark of Sakai\r\nTadakatsu that if Yedo was ever to be a great city, the convenience\r\nof its inhabitants must be first consulted, for, after all, the\r\npeople themselves constituted the best stronghold. This may be\r\nregarded as an evidence of the deference that was beginning then to\r\nbe paid to the non-military classes by the samurai.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time (1658), also, that the city of Yedo obtained its\r\nfirst supply of good water. There was already an aquaduct from\r\nInokashira Lake to the Kanda district of the city, but it carried\r\nonly a very small volume of water, and the idea of harnessing the\r\nTama-gawa to supply the town was due to two citizens, Shoemon and\r\nSeiemon, who subsequently received the family name of Tamagawa. The\r\nBakufu granted a sum of 7500 ryo towards the expense, and on the\r\ncompletion of the work within two years, gifts of 300 ryo were made\r\nto the two projectors. The water had to be carried through a distance\r\nof over thirty miles, and the enterprise did high credit to the\r\nengineering skill of the men of the time.\r\n\r\nDECADENCE OF THE BAKUFU ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nThe era of this fourth Tokugawa shogun, Ietsuna, was remarkable for\r\nthings other than the lawlessness of the \"wave-men.\" From that time\r\nthe Tokugawa began to fare as nearly all great families of previous\r\nages had fared: the substance of the administrative power passed into\r\nthe hands of a minister, its shadow alone remaining to the shogun.\r\nSakai Tadakiyo was the chief author of this change. Secluded from\r\ncontact with the outer world, Ietsuna saw and heard mainly through\r\nthe eyes and ears of the ladies of his household. But Tadakiyo caused\r\nan order to be issued forbidding all access to the Court ladies\r\nexcept by ministerial permit, and thenceforth the shogun became\r\npractically deaf and dumb so far as events outside the castle were\r\nconcerned. Some Japanese historians describe this event as an access\r\nof \"weariness\" on the shogun's part towards the duties of\r\nadministration. This is a euphemism which can be interpreted by what\r\nhas been set down above. From 1666, when he became prime minister in\r\nYedo, Sakai Tadakiyo seems to have deliberately planned the\r\nrelegation of his master to the position of a fainéant and the\r\nsuccession of the shogun's son to supreme power. Tadakiyo's lust of\r\nauthority was equalled only by his cupidity. Everything went to the\r\nhighest bidder. It had gradually become the fashion that the daimyo\r\nshould invite to their Yedo residences all the leading administrators\r\nof the Bakufu. On these entertainments great sums were squandered and\r\nvaluable presents were a feature of the fetes. It also became\r\nfashionable to pay constant visits at the mansions of the chief\r\nofficials and these visits were always accompanied with costly gifts.\r\nIt is recorded that the mansion of Tadakiyo was invariably so crowded\r\nby persons waiting to pay their respects that a man repairing thither\r\nat daybreak could scarcely count on obtaining access by evening-fall.\r\nThe depraved state of affairs brought the administration of the\r\nTokugawa into wide disrepute, and loyal vassals of the family sadly\r\ncontrasted the evil time with the days of Ieyasu, seventy years\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nTHE COURTS OF KYOTO AND OF YEDO\r\n\r\nThe great financial straits to which the Imperial Court was reduced\r\nduring the time of the Muromachi shoguns have been already described.\r\nBoth Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi made some endeavours to\r\ncorrect this evil state of affairs, and when Tokugawa Ieyasu came\r\ninto power he adopted still more liberal methods. In 1604, he\r\nincreased the revenue of the Court by 10,000 koku annually, and in\r\nthe course of the next few years he caused the palace to be rebuilt\r\non a scale of considerable grandeur. The same policy was pursued by\r\nthe second shogun, Hidetada, who assigned to the ex-Emperor an income\r\nof 3000 koku and made various allowances to princes and other members\r\nof the Imperial family. The recipients of these allowances totalled\r\n140, and it is on record that, in the year 1706, the revenues of the\r\nImperial Court aggregated 29,000 koku; those of the ex-Emperor\r\n15,000; those of the princes and Court nobles, 44,000; those of the\r\nMonzeki* temples, 19,000; those of the Court ladies and Imperial\r\nnuns, 7500, and those of the Court officials 2300, the whole making a\r\ntotal of about 120,000 koku. The income of the retired shogun alone\r\nequalled that amount, and it was enormously surpassed by the revenues\r\nof many of the daimyo. It must be noted, however, that although the\r\nrice provided for the above purposes was made a charge upon the Kinai\r\nprovinces as well as upon Tamba and Omi, neither to the Emperor nor\r\nto the Imperial princes nor to the Court nobles were estates granted\r\ndirectly. These incomes were collected and transmitted by officials\r\nof the Bakufu, but not a tsubo of land was under the control of\r\neither sovereign or prince.\r\n\r\n*Temples governed by Imperial princes.\r\n\r\nMilitary affairs, civil administration, financial management,\r\nincluding the casting of coins, judicial and legislative affairs, the\r\nsuperintendence of temples, and so forth, were all in the hands of\r\nthe Bakufu in Yedo or of provincial officials nominated by the\r\nshogun. Nothing could have been more complete than the exclusion of\r\nthe Kyoto Court from the whole realm of practical government; nor\r\ncould any system have contrasted more flagrantly with the theory of\r\nthe Daika reforms, according to which every acre of land throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the empire was the property of the\r\nsovereign. It might have been expected that the Tokugawa shoguns\r\nwould at least have endeavoured to soften this administrative\r\neffacement by pecuniary generosity; but so little of that quality did\r\nthey display that the Emperor and the ex-Emperor were perpetually in\r\na state of financial embarrassment. As for the Court nobles, their\r\nincomes did not always suffice even for the needs of every-day life,\r\nand they were obliged to have recourse to various devices, such as\r\nmarrying their daughters to provincial governors or selling\r\nprofessional diplomas, the right of conferring which was vested in\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\nTHE SEKKE, DENSO, AND SHOSHIDAI\r\n\r\nThe sole functions left to the Imperial Court were those of\r\nappointing the shogun--which of course was only formal--conferring\r\nranks, fixing the name of year-periods, ordering the calendar, taking\r\npart in ceremonials, nominating priests and officials, and\r\nsanctioning the building of temples. Thus, the regent (kwampaku) was\r\nthe sovereign's appointee. He had to be chosen in succession from one\r\nof the five families--Konoe, Takatsukasa, Kujo, Nijo, and Ichijo, to\r\nwhich the general name Go-sekke (the Five Regent Families) was given.\r\nBut the regent was practically without power of any kind. Very\r\ndifferent was the case of the denso, who had direct access to the\r\nThrone. Appointed by the shogun from one of seventeen families\r\nclosely related to the Tokugawa, a denso, before entering upon the\r\nduties of his office, was obliged to swear that he would minutely and\r\nunreservedly report to the Bakufu everything coming to his knowledge.\r\nHis principal duty was to communicate direct with the Throne. There\r\nwas also another Bakufu nominee called the giso, who administered the\r\naffairs of the Imperial Court, and who held, in addition, the post of\r\ndai-nagon, chu-nagon, or sho-nagon, which offices were reserved for\r\nmembers of the Tokugawa family. Yet another official representing the\r\nBakufu was the shoshidai, who managed all matters connected with the\r\nguarding of the Imperial Court and the Court nobles, at the same time\r\ntransacting financial business. In the event of any disturbance\r\noccurring in Court circles in Kyoto, it was reported, first, to the\r\nshoshidai and, then, by him, to the senior officials in Yedo, while\r\nany disturbance occurring in Yedo was equally reported, first to the\r\nshoshidai and afterwards by the latter to the sovereign. The\r\nshoshidai was in fact a governor-general, with powers far superior to\r\nthose of any Court noble, and his sway extended to the eight\r\nprovinces in the neighbourhood of Kyoto. By means of the shoshidai\r\nall circumstances of the Imperial Court were fully conveyed to the\r\nBakufu in Yedo and complete control was exercised over the Imperial\r\ncapital and its environs. The Bakufu were careful to choose for this\r\npost a man whose loyalty and ability stood beyond question. Finally,\r\nreference may be made to the administrator of the reigning\r\nsovereign's Court (Kinri-zuki bugyo) and the administrator of the\r\nex-Emperor's court (Sendo-zuki bugyo), both of whom were Bakufu\r\nnominees.\r\n\r\nTHE 107TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-YOZEI (A.D. 1586-1611)\r\n\r\nThis Emperor held the sceptre throughout the memorable epoch from the\r\ndeath of Nobunaga till that of Ieyasu, and he continued to exercise\r\npower during six years after his abdication. It was he that conferred\r\nthe post of shogun on Ieyasu and gave him his posthumous title of\r\nTosho Gongen. His Majesty was the eldest son of the Emperor Okimachi.\r\nHe surrendered the throne to his third son in 1611, dying at the age\r\nof forty-seven in 1617.\r\n\r\nTHE 108TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-MIZU-NO-O (A.D. 1611-1629)\r\n\r\nThis sovereign had for consort a daughter of the shogun Hidetada, as\r\nalready described. The wedding took place in the year 1620, and its\r\nmagnificence offered a theme for enthusiastic comment by contemporary\r\nhistorians. The shogun was careful to surround the Imperial bride\r\nwith officials of his own choosing, and these, joining hands with the\r\nshoshidai and the denso, constituted an entourage which ordered\r\neverything at Kyoto in strict accordance with the interests of the\r\nTokugawa. The new Empress was dowered with an estate much larger than\r\nthat of the Emperor himself, although the latter's allowance was\r\nincreased by ten thousand koku. It is related that his Majesty's\r\nimpecuniosity compelled the curtailment of various ceremonies and\r\nprevented the giving of presents in the ordinary routine of social\r\nconventions, so that it became necessary to replenish the Imperial\r\npurse by lending rice and money to the citizens at high rates of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nA serious collision occurred during Go-Mizu-no-o's reign between the\r\nCourts of Kyoto and Yedo. The Emperor, who inclined to literature and\r\nreligion, conceived a profound reverence for two Buddhist prelates of\r\ngreat learning and conspicuously holy lives. To these priests, Takuan\r\nand Gyokushitsu, his Majesty presented purple robes, a mark of the\r\nhighest distinction, in apparently unwitting violation of the\r\necclesiastical laws promulgated by Ieyasu, which forbade the giving\r\nof such robes to any bonzes except those of Kennin-ji. On learning of\r\nthe incident, the Bakufu summoned these prelates to Yedo, deprived\r\nthem of the robes, and sent them into banishment. The Emperor,\r\nnaturally much offended, declared that he would no longer occupy the\r\nthrone, and in 1629, the year of the two priests' transportation, he\r\ncarried out his threat, abdicating in favour of the Imperial\r\nprincess, Oki, his eldest daughter by the Tokugawa Empress.\r\n\r\nTHE 109TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS MYOSHO (A.D. 1629-1643)\r\n\r\nThe Princess Oki, eldest daughter of Tokufu-mon-in and the Emperor\r\nGo-Mizu-no-o, was only seven years of age when thus called on to\r\noccupy the throne. During eight hundred years no female had wielded\r\nthe sceptre of Japan, and the princess was not without a brother\r\nolder than herself, though born of a different mother. Thus, the\r\nannouncement of the Emperor's intention created profound astonishment\r\nin the Imperial Court. The partisans of the Bakufu supported the\r\nproject, but the friends of the Imperial family denounced it\r\nstrenuously. Nothing moved the Emperor, however. His Majesty appears\r\nto have thought that to bestow the princess' hand on a subject and to\r\nelevate her elder brother to the throne would surely be productive of\r\nserious mischief, since the husband of the princess, supported by the\r\nBakufu, would prove an invincible power in the State.\r\n\r\nAs for the Tokugawa statesmen, some accounts allege that they\r\nobjected to the Emperor's project, but others say that when the\r\nmatter was reported in Yedo, the shogun signified that his Majesty\r\nmight consult his own judgment. What is certain is that the Bakufu\r\nsent to Kyoto the prime minister, Sakai Tadakiyo, with three other\r\nrepresentatives, and that shortly after their arrival in the Imperial\r\ncapital, arrangements were completed for the proposed change. The\r\nImperial consort, Tofuku-mon-in, was declared ex-Empress with a\r\nrevenue of 10,000 koku, and the little princess, who is known in\r\nhistory as Myosho, received an income of 20,000 koku; while to the\r\nex-Emperor, Go-Mizu-no-o, only 3000 koku were allotted. Not until\r\n1634, on the occasion of a visit made by Iemitsu, was this glaring\r\ncontrast corrected: the shogun then increased the ex-Emperor's\r\nallowance to 7000 koku, and his Majesty continued to administer\r\npublic affairs from his place of retirement until 1680, when he died\r\nhi his eighty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nTHE 110TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-KOMYO (A.D. 1643-1654)\r\n\r\nThis sovereign was a brother of the Empress Myosho but of a different\r\nmother. He was brought up by Tofuku-mon-in as though he were her real\r\nchild, until he succeeded to the throne at the age of eleven,\r\noccupying it for eleven years. Form his earliest youth he showed\r\nsagacity, magnanimity, and benevolence. His love of literature was\r\nabsorbing, and he studied earnestly, taking the priests of the Five\r\nTemples as his teachers. He is said to have arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat a sovereign should never study any useless branch of learning,\r\nand as he failed to see the utility of Buddhism, he turned to\r\nConfucianism in preference. Moreover, dissatisfied with the old\r\ncommentaries of the Han and Tang dynasties, he chose in their stead\r\nthe new classics composed by Chengtsz and Chutsz; and as for Japanese\r\nliterature, he condemned as grossly misleading works like the Genji\r\nMonogatari and the Ise Monogatari.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this sovereign conceived the ambition of\r\nrecovering the administrative authority. His reign extended from the\r\ntwenty-second year of Iemitsu's sway to the fifth of Ietsuna's, and\r\nin the troubles of that period he thought that he saw his\r\nopportunity. It is related that he devoted much attention to sword\r\nexercise, and the shoshidai Itakura Shigemune warned him that the\r\nstudy of military matters did not become the Imperial Court and would\r\nprobably provoke a remonstrance from Yedo should the fact become\r\nknown there. The Emperor taking no notice of this suggestion,\r\nShigemune went so far as to declare his intention of committing\r\nsuicide unless the fencing lessons were discontinued. Thereupon the\r\nyoung Emperor calmly observed: \"I have never seen a military man kill\r\nhimself, and the spectacle will be interesting. You had better have a\r\nplatform erected in the palace grounds so that your exploit may be\r\nclearly witnessed.\" When this incident was reported by the shoshidai\r\nto Yedo, the Bakufu concluded that some decisive measure must be\r\ntaken, but before their resolve had materialized and before the\r\nsovereign's plans had matured, he died of small-pox, in 1654, at the\r\nage of twenty-two, having accomplished nothing except the restoration\r\nand improvement of certain Court ceremonials, the enactment of a few\r\nsumptuary laws, and the abandonment of cremation in the case of\r\nImperial personages.\r\n\r\nTHE 111TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-SAIEN (A.D. 1654-1663) AND\r\nTHE 112TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR REIGEN (A.D. 1663-1686)\r\n\r\nGo-Saien was the sixth son of the Emperor Go-Mizu-no-o. His reign is\r\nremarkable in connexion with the attitude of the Yedo Bakufu towards\r\nthe Throne. In 1657, as already related, Yedo was visited by a\r\nterrible conflagration, and another of scarcely less destructive\r\nviolence occurred in the same city the following year, while, in\r\n1661, the Imperial palace itself was burned to the ground, the same\r\nfate overtaking the principal Shinto shrine in Ise, and nearly every\r\nprovince suffering more or less from a similar cause. Moreover, in\r\n1662, a series of earthquakes disturbed the country throughout a\r\nwhole month, and the nation became almost demoralized in the face of\r\nthese numerous calamities. Then the Bakufu took an extraordinary\r\nstep. They declared that such visitations must be referred to the\r\nsovereign's want of virtue and that the only remedy lay in his\r\nabdication. The shogun, Ietsuna, was now ruling in Yedo. He sent\r\nenvoys to Kyoto conveying an order for the dethronement of the\r\nEmperor, and although his Majesty was ostensibly allowed to abdicate\r\nof his own will, there could be no doubt as to the real circumstances\r\nof the case. His brother, Reigen, succeeded him, and after holding\r\nthe sceptre for twenty-four years, continued to administer affairs\r\nfrom his place of retirement until his death, in 1732.\r\n\r\nSANKE AND SANKYO\r\n\r\nWhen Ieyasu, after the battle of Sekigahara, distributed the fiefs\r\nthroughout the Empire, he gave four important estates to his own\r\nsons, namely, Echizen to Hideyasu; Owari to Tadayoshi; Mito to\r\nNobuyoshi, and Echigo to Tadateru. Subsequently, after the deaths of\r\nTadayoshi and Nobuyoshi, he assigned Owari to his sixth son,\r\nYoshinao, and appointed his seventh son, Yorinobu, to the Kii fief,\r\nwhile to his eighth son, Yorifusa, Mito was given. These last three\r\nwere called the Sanke (the Three Families). From them the successor\r\nto the shogunate was chosen in the event of failure of issue in the\r\ndirect line. Afterwards this system was extended by the addition of\r\nthree branch-families (Sankyo), namely those of Tayasu and\r\nHitotsubashi by Munetake and Munetada, respectively, sons of the\r\nshogun Yoshimune, and that of Shimizu by Shigeyoshi, son of the\r\nshogun Ieshige. It was enacted that if no suitable heir to the\r\nshogunate was furnished by the Sanke, the privilege of supplying one\r\nshould devolve on the Sankyo, always, however, in default of an heir\r\nin the direct line. The representatives of the Sanke had their\r\nestates and castles, but no fiefs were assigned to the Sankyo; they\r\nresided in Yedo close to the shogun's palace, and received each an\r\nannual allowance from the Bakufu treasury.\r\n\r\nTHE FEUDAL SYSTEM OF THE TOKUGAWA\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that in distributing the fiefs Ieyasu aimed at\r\nparalyzing the power of the tozama daimyo and vitalizing that of the\r\nfudai barons. This he effected, as far as concerned the tozama\r\nfeudatories, by isolating them from each other, or by placing those\r\nof equal strength in juxtaposition, so that they might become rivals;\r\nwhile in the case of fudai barons, he established an effective system\r\nof communications between them, so that co-operation and\r\nconcentration of forces were facilitated. Broadly speaking, this\r\nmethod had for result the planting of the tozama daimyo in the west\r\nand of the fudai barons in the east, as well as along the main roads\r\nbetween the two capitals. The plan worked admirably during 270 years,\r\nbut at the Restoration, in 1867, the western daimyo combined to\r\noverthrow the shogunate.\r\n\r\nVery noticeable were the steps taken to provide facilities for\r\ncommunication between Yedo and Kyoto. No less than fifty-three\r\nposting stations were established along the road from the Bakufu\r\ncapital to the Imperial city, and at several places barriers were set\r\nup. Among these latter, Hakone was considered specially important.\r\nThe duty of guarding the barrier there was assigned to the Okubo\r\nfamily, who enjoyed the full confidence of the Tokugawa and who had\r\ntheir castle in Odawara. No one could pass this barrier without a\r\npermit. Women were examined with signal strictness, they being\r\nregarded as part of the system which required that the wives of the\r\ndaimyo should live in Yedo as hostages. Thus, whereas a man was\r\ngranted ingress or egress if he carried a passport signed by his own\r\nfeudal chief and addressed to the guards at the barrier, a woman\r\nmight not pass unless she was provided with an order signed by a\r\nBakufu official. Moreover, female searchers were constantly on duty\r\nwhose business it was to subject women travellers to a scrutiny of\r\nthe strictest character, involving, even, the loosening of the\r\ncoiffure. All these precautions formed part of the sankin kotai\r\nsystem, which proved one of the strongest buttresses of Tokugawa\r\npower. But, from the days of Ietsuna, the wives and children of the\r\ndaimyo were allowed to return to their provinces, and under the\r\neighth shogun, Yoshimune, the system of sankin kotai ceased to be\r\nbinding. This was because the Tokugawa found themselves sufficiently\r\npowerful to dispense with such artificial aids.\r\n\r\nTHE FIEFS\r\n\r\nThere were certain general divisions of the feudatories. Everyone\r\npossessing a fief of 10,000 koku or upwards was called a daimyo. The\r\ntitle included the Sanke, the Sankyo, the gokemon (governor of\r\nEchizen), the fudai (hereditary vassals), and the tozama. These were\r\nagain subdivided into three classes according to the sizes of their\r\nfiefs. In the first class stood the kokushu (called also kuni-mochi,\r\nor provincial barons) who possessed revenues of at least 300,000\r\nkoku. The second class consisted of the joshu (called also\r\nshiro-mochi, or castle-owning barons) whose incomes ranged between\r\n100,000 and 300,000 koku. Finally, the third class was composed of\r\nthe ryoshu (sometimes known as shiro-nashi, or castleless barons),\r\nwhose revenues ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 koku. These feudatories\r\nmight be recommended by the shogun for Court rank in Kyoto, but the\r\nhighest office thus conferred was that of dainagon (great\r\ncouncillor), from which fact the attitude of the feudatories towards\r\nimperially conferred distinctions can be easily appreciated.\r\nNevertheless, the rules of etiquette were strictly observed by\r\nprovincial magnates attending Court functions. They had to conform\r\ncarefully to the order of their precedence and with the sumptuary\r\nrules as to colour and quality of garments, and any departure from\r\nthese conventions was severely punished.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSION\r\n\r\nIf a feudatory committed some crime or died childless, the law\r\nrequired that he should be transferred to another province, or that\r\nhis successor should suffer a considerable reduction of revenue.\r\nExperience showed, however, that as many of the feudatories died\r\nchildless, there were numerous losses of fiefs, and ultimately it was\r\nenacted that a baron might adopt a successor by way of precaution,\r\nunless he deferred that step until he lay dying or sought permission\r\nto take it before he reached the age of seventeen. This meant that if\r\nany feudal chief died before reaching his seventeenth year, his\r\nestate was lost to his family. By way of correcting such a hardship,\r\nthe adoption of an heir was afterwards sanctioned without reference\r\nto the age of the adopter, and it was further decided that a man of\r\nfifty or upwards might adopt a son even on his death-bed. Finally, in\r\nthe year 1704, all these restrictions were virtually abolished, and\r\nespecially the rule that an adopted son must necessarily belong to\r\nthe family of his adopter.\r\n\r\nSEVERITY OF THE TOKUGAWA TOWARDS THE FEUDATORIES\r\n\r\nAlthough Ieyasu and his successors in the shogunate did not fail to\r\nprovide large estates for their own kith and kin, they never showed\r\nany leniency in dealing with the latter's offences. Ieyasu professed\r\nto believe in the potency of justice above all administrative\r\ninstruments, and certainly he himself as well as his successors\r\nobeyed that doctrine unswervingly in so far as the treatment of their\r\nown families was concerned. They did not hesitate to confiscate\r\nfiefs, to pronounce sentence of exile, or even to condemn to death.\r\nThus, in the year of Ieyasu's decease, his sixth son, Matsudaira\r\nTadateru, was deprived of his fief--610,000 koku--and removed from\r\nEchigo to Asama, in Ise. Tadateru's offence was that he had unjustly\r\ndone a vassal of the shogun to death, and had not moved to the\r\nassistance of the Tokugawa in the Osaka War. Moreover, when his elder\r\nbrother, the shogun Hidetada, repaired to the Imperial palace,\r\nTadateru had pretended to be too ill to accompany him, though in\r\nreality he was engaged in a hunting expedition. This was the first\r\ninstance of the Bakufu punishing one of their own relatives.\r\n\r\nAnother example was furnished in 1623 when Matsudaira Tadanao, lord\r\nof Echizen, was sentenced to confinement in his own house and was\r\nordered to hand over his fief of 750,000 koku to his heir. This\r\nTadanao was a grandson of Ieyasu, and had shown himself a strong\r\nsoldier in the Osaka War. But subsequently he fell into habits of\r\nviolence and lawlessness, culminating in neglect of the sankin kotai\r\nsystem. His uncle, the shogun Hidetada, sentenced him as above\r\ndescribed. Under the administration of Iemitsu this unflinching\r\nattitude towards wrongdoers was maintained more relentlessly than\r\never. The dai nagon, Tadanaga, lord of Suruga and younger brother of\r\nIemitsu by the same mother, received (1618) in Kai province a fief of\r\n180,000 koku, and, seven years later, this was increased by Suruga\r\nand Totomi, bringing the whole estate up to 500,000 koku. He resided\r\nin the castle of Sumpu and led an evil life, paying no attention\r\nwhatever to the remonstrances of his vassals. In 1632, Iemitsu\r\nconfiscated his fief and exiled him to Takasaki in Kotsuke, where he\r\nwas compelled to undergo confinement in the Yashiki of Ando\r\nShigenaga. Fourteen months later, sentence of death was pronounced\r\nagainst him at the early age of twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nOther instances might be quoted showing how little mercy the Tokugawa\r\nshoguns extended to wrongdoers among their own relatives. It need\r\nhardly be said that outside clans fared no better. Anyone who gave\r\ntrouble was promptly punished. Thus, in 1614, Okubo Tadachika, who\r\nhad rendered good service to the Bakufu in early days, and who\r\nenjoyed the full confidence of the shogun, was deprived of his castle\r\nat Odawara and sentenced to confinement for the comparatively\r\ntrifling offence of contracting a private marriage. Again, in 1622,\r\nthe prime minister, Honda Masazumi, lord of Utsunomiya, lost his fief\r\nof 150,000 koku and was exiled to Dawe for the sin of rebuilding his\r\ncastle without due permission, and killing a soldier of the Bakufu.\r\nTo persons criticising this latter sentence as too severe, Doi\r\nToshikatsu is recorded to have replied that any weakness shown at\r\nthis early stage of the Tokugawa rule must ultimately prove fatal to\r\nthe permanence of the Bakufu, and he expressed the conviction that\r\nnone would approve the punishment more readily than Masazumi's dead\r\nfather, Masanobu, were he still living to pass judgment.\r\n\r\nDoubtless political expediency, not the dictates of justice, largely\r\ninspired the conduct of the Bakufu in these matters, for in\r\nproportion as the material influence of the Tokugawa increased, that\r\nof the Toyotomi diminished. In 1632, when the second shogun,\r\nHidetada, died, it is related that the feudal barons observed the\r\nconduct of his successor, Iemitsu, with close attention, and that a\r\nfeeling of some uneasiness prevailed. Iemitsu, whether obeying his\r\nown instinct or in deference to the advice of his ministers, Sakai\r\nTadakatsu and Matsudaira Nobutsuna, summoned the feudal chiefs to his\r\ncastle in Yedo and addressed them as follows: \"My father and my\r\ngrandfather, with your assistance and after much hardship, achieved\r\ntheir great enterprise to which I, who have followed the profession\r\nof arms since my childhood, now succeed. It is my purpose to treat\r\nyou all without distinction as my hereditary vassals. If any of you\r\nobject to be so treated, let him return to his province and take the\r\nconsequences.\"\r\n\r\nDate Masamune assumed the duty of replying to that very explicit\r\nstatement. \"There is none here,\" he said, \"that is not grateful for\r\nthe benevolence he has received at the hands of the Tokugawa. If\r\nthere be such a thankless and disloyal person, and if he conceive\r\ntreacherous designs, I, Masamune, will be the first to attack him and\r\nstrike him down. The shogun need not move so much as one soldier.\"\r\nWith this spirited reply all the assembled daimyo expressed their\r\nconcurrence, and Iemitsu proceeded to distribute his father's\r\nlegacies to the various barons and their vassals. Very soon after his\r\naccession he had to order the execution of his own brother, Tadanaga,\r\nand the banishment of Kato Tadahiro, son of the celebrated Kato\r\nKiyomasa. The latter was punished on the ground that he sent away his\r\nfamily from Yedo during the time of mourning for the late shogun,\r\nHidetada. He was deprived of his estate at Kumamoto in Higo and was\r\nexiled to Dewa province.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of these two barons is said to have been in the sequel\r\nof a device planned by Iemitsu and carried out by Doi Toshikatsu. The\r\nlatter, being accused of a simulated crime, was sentenced to\r\nconfinement in his mansion. Thence he addressed to all the daimyo a\r\nsecret circular, urging them to revolt and undertaking to make\r\nTadanaga shogun instead of Iemitsu. With two exceptions every baron\r\nto whose hands this circular came forwarded it to the Bakufu in Yedo.\r\nThe exceptions were Tadanaga and Tadahiro, who consequently fell\r\nunder the shogun's suspicion. Thereafter, it is related that some of\r\nthe barons set themselves to deceive the Bakufu by various wiles.\r\nThus, Maeda Toshinaga had recourse to the manoeuvre of allowing the\r\nhair in his nostrils to grow long, a practice which speedily earned\r\nfor him the reputation of insanity, and Date Masamune conceived the\r\ndevice of carrying a sword with a wooden blade. The apprehensions of\r\nwhich such acts were indicative cannot be considered surprising in\r\nview of the severe discipline exercised by the Bakufu. Thus, during\r\nthe shogunate of Hidetada, no less than forty changes are recorded to\r\nhave been made among the feudatories, and in the time of Iemitsu\r\nthere were thirty-five of such incidents. History relates that to be\r\ntransferred from one fief to another, even without nominal loss of\r\nrevenue, was regarded as a calamity of ten years' duration. All this\r\nwas partly prompted by the Bakufu's policy of weakening the\r\nfeudatories. To the same motive must be assigned constant orders for\r\ncarrying out some costly public work.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FANS\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"THE BUGAKU,\" ANCIENT DANCING AND MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nMIDDLE PERIOD OF THE TOKUGAWA BAKUFU; FROM THE FIFTH SHOGUN,\r\nTSUNAYOSHI, TO THE TENTH SHOGUN, IEHARU (1680-1786)\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF TSUNAYOSHI\r\n\r\nIN 1680, the fourth shogun, Ietsuna, fell dangerously ill, and a\r\ncouncil of the chief Bakufu officials was held to decide upon his\r\nsuccessor. The Bakufu prime minister, Sakai Tadakiyo, proposed that\r\nthe example of Kamakura should be followed, and that an Imperial\r\nprince should be invited to assume the office of shogun. Thereupon\r\nHotta Masatoshi, one of the junior ministers, vehemently\r\nremonstrated. \"Is the prime minister jesting?\" he is reported to have\r\nasked. \"There is no question whatever as to the succession. That\r\ndignity falls to Tsunayoshi and to Tsunayoshi alone. He is the\r\nlegitimate son of the late shogun, Iemitsu, and the only brother of\r\nthe present shogun, Ietsuna. If the minister is not jesting, his\r\nproposition is inexplicable.\" This bold utterance was received with\r\nprofound silence, and after a few moments Sakai Tadakiyo retired from\r\nthe council chamber.\r\n\r\nIt has to be remembered in connexion with this incident, that\r\nTadakiyo exercised almost complete sway in the Bakufu Court at that\r\ntime, and the fact that he yielded quietly to Hotta Masatoshi's\r\nremonstrance goes far to acquit him of any sinister design such as\r\nsecuring the whole administrative power for himself by setting up an\r\nImperial prince as a mere figurehead. The more probable explanation\r\nis that as one of the consorts of the shogun Ietsuna was enceinte at\r\nthat time, the Bakufu prime minister desired to postpone any family\r\ndecision until the birth of her child, since to dispense with an\r\nImperial prince would be as easy to procure one, whereas if one of\r\nthe shogun's lineage were nominated, he would be difficult to\r\ndisplace. There had been born to Iemitsu five sons, of whom the\r\neldest, Ietsuna, had succeeded to the shogunate, and three others had\r\ndied, the only one remaining alive being Tsunayoshi, who, having been\r\nborn in 1646, was now (1680) in his thirty-fourth year.\r\n\r\nHOTTA MASATOSHI\r\n\r\nOn Tsunayoshi's accession the prime minister, Sakai Tadakiyo, was\r\nreleased from office, and Hotta Masatoshi became his successor.\r\nNaturally, as Masatoshi had been instrumental in obtaining the\r\nsuccession for Tsunayoshi, his influence with the latter was very\r\ngreat. But there can be no question that he deserves to rank as one\r\nof Japan's leading statesmen in any age, and that he devoted his\r\nsignal abilities to the cause of progress and administrative purity.\r\nThe result of his strenuous services was to check the corruption\r\nwhich had come to pervade every department of State in the closing\r\nyears of the fourth shogun's sway, and to infuse the duties of\r\ngovernment with an atmosphere of diligence and uprightness.\r\n\r\nTHE ECHIGO COMPLICATION\r\n\r\nFor several years prior to the accession of Tsunayoshi, the province\r\nof Echigo had been disturbed by an intrigue in the family of\r\nMatsudaira Mitsunaga. It is unnecessary to enter into further\r\ndetails. The incident was typical of the conditions existing in many\r\nof the barons' households, and the history of Japan furnishes\r\nnumerous parallel cases. But connected with this particular example\r\nis the remarkable fact that the shogun himself finally undertook in\r\nthe hall of justice to decide the issue, and that the rendering of\r\njustice by the chief of the Bakufu became thenceforth a not\r\ninfrequently practised habit. Instructed by his prime minister, the\r\nshogun swept aside all the obstacles placed in the path of justice by\r\ncorruption and prejudice; sentenced the principal intriguer to death;\r\nconfiscated the Mitsunaga family's estate of 250,000 koku on the\r\nground of its chief's incompetence, and severely punished all the\r\nBakufu officials who had been parties to the plot.\r\n\r\nTHE ATAKA MARU\r\n\r\nAnother act of Tsunayoshi stands to the credit of his acumen.\r\nAlthough the third shogun, Iemitsu, had vetoed the building of any\r\nvessels exceeding five hundred koku capacity, his object being to\r\nprevent oversea enterprise, he caused to be constructed for the use\r\nof the Bakufu a great ship called the Ataka Maru, which required a\r\ncrew several hundred strong and involved a yearly outlay figuring in\r\nthe official accounts at one hundred thousand koku. One of\r\nTsunayoshi's first orders was that this huge vessel should be broken\r\nup, and when his ministers remonstrated on the ground that she would\r\nbe invaluable in case of emergency, he replied that if an\r\ninsurrection could not be suppressed without such extraordinary\r\ninstruments, the Bakufu might step down at once from the seats of\r\npower. \"As for me,\" he added, \"I have no desire to preserve such an\r\nevidence of constant apprehension and at such a charge on the coffers\r\nof the State.\"\r\n\r\nENCOURAGEMENT OF VIRTUE\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi also instructed his officials to search throughout the\r\nempire for persons of conspicuous filial piety and women of noted\r\nchastity. To these he caused to be distributed presents of money or\r\npensions, and he directed the littérateurs of the Hayashi family to\r\nwrite the biographies of the recipients of such rewards. In fact, the\r\nearly years of the shogun's administration constitute one of the\r\nbrightest periods in the history of the Tokugawa Bakufu.\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF HOTTA MASATOSHI\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October, 1684, the Bakufu prime minister, Hotta\r\nMasatoshi, was assassinated in the shogun's palace by one of the\r\njunior ministers, Inaba Masayasu, who met his death immediately at\r\nthe hands of the bystanders. This extraordinary affair remains\r\nshrouded in mystery until the present day. Hotta Masatoshi was the\r\nthird son of Masamori, who died by his own hand to follow his master,\r\nIemitsu, to the grave. Masatoshi, inheriting a part of his father's\r\ndomain, received the title of Bitchu no Kami, and resided in the\r\ncastle of Koga, ultimately (1680) becoming prime minister (dairo)\r\nwith an annual revenue of 130,000 koku. His high qualities are\r\nrecorded above, but everything goes to show that he had more than the\r\nordinary reformer's stubbornness, and that tolerance of a\r\nsubordinate's errors was wholly foreign to his disposition. Even to\r\nthe shogun himself he never yielded in the smallest degree, and by\r\nthe majority of those under him he was cordially detested. The\r\nrecords say that on one occasion, when remonstrated with by his\r\nfriend, the daimyo of Hirado, who warned him that his hardness and\r\nseverity might involve him in trouble, Masatoshi replied, \"I thank\r\nyou for your advice, but so long as I am endeavouring to reform the\r\ncountry, I have no time to think of myself.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that a man of such methods had enemies\r\nsufficiently numerous and sufficiently resolute to compass his death.\r\nOn the other hand, Masayasu, his assassin, was related to him by\r\nmarriage, and possessed an estate of 25,000 koku, as well as holding\r\nthe position of junior minister of State. It is extremely unlikely\r\nthat a man in such a position would have resorted to such a desperate\r\nact without great provocation or ample sanction. The question is, was\r\nthe shogun himself privy to the deed? It is recorded that there was\r\nfound on Masayasu's person a document expressing deep gratitude for\r\nthe favours he had received at the hands of the shogun, and declaring\r\nthat only by taking the life of Masatoshi could any adequate return\r\nbe made. It is further recorded that the steward of the Bakufu,\r\naddressing the corpse of Masayasu, declared that the deceased had\r\nshown unparallelled loyalty. Again, history says that Mitsukuni,\r\ndaimyo of Mito, repaired to the Inaba mansion after the incident, and\r\nexpressed to Masayasu's mother his condolences and his applause.\r\nFinally, after Masatoshi's death, his son was degraded in rank and\r\nremoved to a greatly reduced estate. All these things are difficult\r\nto explain except on the supposition that the shogun himself was\r\nprivy to the assassination.\r\n\r\nENCOURAGEMENT OF CONFUCIANISM\r\n\r\nThe third shogun, Iemitsu, addressing the mother of his son,\r\nTsimayoshi, is said to have expressed profound regret that his own\r\neducation had been confined to military science. \"That is to me,\" he\r\nis reported to have said, \"a source of perpetual sorrow, and care\r\nshould be taken that Tsunayoshi, who seems to be a clever lad, should\r\nreceive full instruction in literature.\" In compliance with this\r\nadvice, steps were taken to interest Tsunayoshi in letters, and he\r\nbecame so attached to this class of study that even when sick he\r\nfound solace in his books. The doctrines of Confucius attracted him\r\nabove all other systems of ethics. He fell into the habit of\r\ndelivering lectures on the classics, and to show his reverence for\r\nthe Chinese sages, he made it a rule to wear full dress on these\r\noccasions, and to worship after the manner of all Confucianists. It\r\nhas already been related that a shrine of Confucius was built in Ueno\r\nPark by the Tokugawa daimyo of Owari, and that the third shogun,\r\nIemitsu, visited this shrine in 1633 to offer prayer. Fifty years\r\nlater, the fifth shogun, Tsunayoshi, followed that example, and also\r\nlistened to lectures on the classics by Hayashi Nobuatsu.\r\nSubsequently (1691), a new shrine was erected at Yushima in the Kongo\r\ndistrict of Yedo, and was endowed with an estate of one thousand koku\r\nto meet the expenses of the spring and autumn festivals. Further, the\r\ndaimyo were required to contribute for the erection of a school in\r\nthe vicinity of the shrine. At this school youths of ability,\r\nselected from among the sons of the Bakufu officials and of the\r\ndaimyo, were educated, the doctrines of Confucius being thus rendered\r\nmore and more popular.\r\n\r\nUnder Tsunayoshi's auspices, also, many books were published which\r\nremain to this day standard works of their kind. Another step taken\r\nby the shogun was to obtain from the Court in Kyoto the rank of\r\njunior fifth class for Hayashi Nobuatsu, the great Confucian scholar,\r\nwho was also nominated minister of Education and chief instructor at\r\nKongo College. Up to that time it had been the habit of Confucianists\r\nand of medical men to shave their heads and use titles corresponding\r\nto those of Buddhist priests. In these circumstances neither\r\nConfucianists nor physicians could be treated as samurai, and they\r\nwere thus excluded from all State honours. The distinction conferred\r\nupon Hayashi Nobuatsu by the Imperial Court effectually changed these\r\nconditions. The Confucianists ceased to shave their heads and became\r\neligible for official posts. Thereafter, ten of Hayashi's disciples\r\nwere nominated among the shogun's retainers, and were required to\r\ndeliver lectures periodically at the court of the Bakufu. In short,\r\nin whatever related to learning, Tsunayoshi stands easily at the head\r\nof all the Tokugawa shoguns.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF CALENDAR\r\n\r\nA noteworthy incident of Tsunayoshi's administration was a change of\r\ncalendar, effected in the year 1683. The credit of this achievement\r\nbelongs to a mathematician called Shibukawa Shunkai. A profound\r\nstudent, his researches had convinced him that the Hsuan-ming\r\ncalendar, borrowed originally from China and used in Japan ever since\r\nthe year A.D. 861, was defective. He pointed out some of its errors\r\nin a memorial addressed to the Bakufu under the sway of the fourth\r\nshogun, but the then prime minister, Sakai Tadakiyo, paid no\r\nattention to the document. Shunkai, however, did not desist. In 1683,\r\nan eclipse of the moon took place, and he demonstrated that it was\r\nerroneously calculated in the Chinese calendar. The fifth shogun,\r\nTsunayoshi, was then in power, and the era of his reforming spirit\r\nhad not yet passed away. He adopted Shunkai's suggestion and obtained\r\nthe Imperial sanction for a change of calendar so that the Husan-ming\r\nsystem went out of force after 822 years of use in Japan.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE LITERATURE\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi did not confine his patronage to Chinese literature; he\r\ndevoted much energy to the encouragement of Japanese classical\r\nstudies, also. Thus, in 1689, he invited to Yedo Kitamura Kigin and\r\nhis son Shuncho and bestowed upon the former the title of Hoin\r\ntogether with a revenue of five hundred koku. This marked the\r\ncommencement of a vigorous revival of Japanese literature in the\r\nBakufu capital. Moreover, in Osaka a scholar named Keichu Ajari\r\npublished striking annotations of the celebrated anthologies, the\r\nManyo-shu and the Kokin-shu, which attracted the admiration of\r\nTokugawa Mitsukuni, baron of Mito. He invited Keichu to his castle\r\nand treated him with marked consideration. These littérateurs were\r\nthe predecessors of the celebrated Kamo and Motoori, of whom there\r\nwill be occasion to speak by and by.\r\n\r\nFINE ARTS\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi's patronage extended also to the field of the fine arts.\r\nThe Tokugawa Bakufu had hitherto encouraged the Kano School only\r\nwhereas the Tosa Academy was patronized by the Court at Kyoto. This\r\npartiality was corrected by Tsunayoshi., He invited Sumiyoshi\r\nGukei--also called Hirozumi--the most distinguished pupil of Tosa\r\nMitsuoki, bestowed on him a revenue of two hundred koku, and gave him\r\nthe official position of chief artist of the Tosa-ryu, placing him on\r\nan equal footing with the chief of the Kano-ryu. It was at this time\r\nalso that the ukiyoe (genre picture) may be said to have won popular\r\nfavour. Contemporaneously there appeared some dramatic authors of\r\nhigh ability, and as the ukiyoe and the drama appealed mainly to the\r\nmiddle and lower classes, the domain of literature and the fine arts\r\nreceived wide extension. Thus, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, of Osaka, the\r\ngreatest dramatist that his country ever possessed, composed plays\r\nwhich have earned for him the title of the \"Shakespeare of Japan;\"\r\nand as for the light literature of the era, though it was disfigured\r\nby erotic features, it faithfully reflected in other respects the\r\nsocial conditions and sentiments of the time.\r\n\r\nTHE MERCANTILE CLASS\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of Japanese history down to the second half of\r\nthe seventeenth century, the canons and customs were dictated solely\r\nby the upper class, and neither merchants nor artisans were\r\nrecognized as possessing any social or literary influence whatever.\r\nBut in the middle period of the Tokugawa Bakufu--the Genroku period,\r\nas it is commonly called--the tradesman became a comparatively\r\nconspicuous figure. For example, in the realm of poetry, hitherto\r\nstrictly reserved for the upper classes, the classic verse called\r\nrenga (linked song) was considered to be sullied by the introduction\r\nof any common or every-day word, and therefore could be composed only\r\nby highly educated persons. This now found a substitute in the\r\nhaikai, which admitted language taken from purely Japanese sources\r\nand could thus be produced without any exercise of special\r\nscholarship. Afterwards, by the addition of the hokku, an\r\nabbreviation of the already brief renga and haikai, which adapted\r\nitself to the capacities of anyone possessing a nimble wit or a\r\nsparkling thought, without any preparation of literary study, the\r\nrange of poetry was still further extended. Matsuo Basho Was the\r\nfather of the haikai and the hokku, and his mantle descended upon\r\nKikaku, Ransetsu, Kyoriku, and other celebrities. They travelled\r\nround the country popularizing their art and immensely expanding the\r\nfield of literature. The craft of penmanship flourished equally, and\r\nwas graced by such masters as Hosoi Kotaku and Kitamura Sessan. Yedo,\r\nthe metropolis of wealth and fashion, became also the capital of\r\nliterature and the fine arts, and a characteristic of the era was the\r\ndisappearance of charlatans, whether laymen or bonzes, who professed\r\nto teach the arcana of special accomplishments. In short, every\r\nbranch of study passed out of the exclusive control of one or two\r\nmasters and became common property, to the great advantage of\r\noriginal developments.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE ROJU\r\n\r\nWhat has thus far been written depicts the bright side of\r\nTsunayoshi's administration. It is necessary now to look at the\r\nreverse of the picture. There we are first confronted by an important\r\nchange of procedure. It had been the custom ever since the days of\r\nIeyasu to conduct the debates of the council of ministers (Roju) in a\r\nchamber adjoining the shogun's sitting-room, so that he could hear\r\nevery word of the discussion, and thus keep himself au courant of\r\npolitical issues. After the assassination of Hotta Masatoshi this\r\narrangement was changed. The council chamber was removed to a\r\ndistance, and guards were placed in the room where it had originally\r\nassembled, special officials being appointed for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining communications between the shogun and the Roju. This\r\ninnovation was nominally prompted by solicitude for the shogun's\r\nsafety, but as its obvious result was to narrow his sources of\r\ninformation and to bring him under the direct influence of the newly\r\nappointed officials, there is strong reason to believe that the\r\nmeasure was a reversion to the evil schemes of Sakai Tadakiyo, who\r\nplotted to usurp the shogun's authority.\r\n\r\nYANAGISAWA YASUAKI\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi had at that time a favourite attendant on whom he\r\nconferred the rank of Dewa no Kami with an estate at Kawagoe which\r\nyielded 100,000 koku annually. The friendship of the shogun for this\r\nmost corrupt official had its origin in community of literary taste.\r\nTsunayoshi lectured upon the \"Doctrine of the Mean,\" and Yasuaki on\r\nthe Confucian \"Analects,\" and after these learned discourses a\r\nSarugaku play, or some other form of light entertainment, was\r\norganized. The shogun was a misogynist, and Yasuaki understood well\r\nthat men who profess to hate women become the slave of the fair sex\r\nwhen their alleged repugnance is overcome. He therefore set himself\r\nto lead the shogun into licentious habits, and the lecture-meetings\r\nultimately changed their complexion. Tsunayoshi, giving an ideograph\r\nfrom his name to Yasuaki, called him Yoshiyasu, and authorized him to\r\nassume the family name of Matsudaira, conferring upon him at the same\r\ntime a new domain in the province of Kai yielding 150,000 koku.\r\nThenceforth, the administration fell entirely into the hands of this\r\nschemer. No prime minister (dairo) was appointed after the\r\nassassination of Hotta Masatoshi; the council of ministers became a\r\nmere echo of Yoahiyasu's will and the affairs of the Bakufu were\r\nmanaged by one man alone.\r\n\r\nDOG MANIA\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi lost his only son in childhood and no other being born to\r\nhim, he invited a high Buddhist priest to pray for an heir to the\r\nshogunate. This priest, Ryuko by name, informed Tsunayoshi that his\r\nchildless condition was a punishment for taking animal life in a\r\nprevious state of existence, and that if he wished to be relieved of\r\nthe curse, he must show mercy, particularly to dogs, as he had been\r\nborn in the year whose zodiacal sign was that of the \"Dog.\" It seems\r\nstrange that such an earnest believer in the Confucian doctrine\r\nshould have had recourse to Buddhism in this matter. But here also\r\nthe influence of Yoshiyasu is discernible. At his suggestion the\r\nshogun built in Yedo two large temples, Gokoku-ji and Goji-in, and\r\nRyuko was the prelate of the former. An order was accordingly issued\r\nagainst slaughtering dogs or taking life in any form, the result\r\nbeing that all wild animals multiplied enormously and wrought great\r\ndamage to crops. Thereupon the Bakufu issued a further notice to the\r\neffect that in case wild animals committed ravages, they might be\r\ndriven away by noise, or even by firing blank cartridges, provided\r\nthat an oath were made not to kill them. Should these means prove\r\ndefective, instructions must be sought from the judicial department.\r\nMoreover, if any animal's life was taken under proper sanction, the\r\ncarcass must be buried without removing any part of its flesh or\r\nskin. Violations of this order were to be severely punished, and it\r\nwas enacted that an accurate register must be kept of all dogs owned\r\nby the people, strict investigations being made in the event of the\r\ndisappearance of a registered dog, and the officials were specially\r\nwarned against permitting one animal to be substituted for another.\r\nStrange dogs were to be well fed, and any person neglecting this\r\nobligation was to be reported to the authorities.\r\n\r\nAt first these orders were not very seriously regarded, but by and\r\nby, when many persons had been banished to Hachijo-jima for killing\r\ndogs; when several others had been reproved publicly for not giving\r\nfood to homeless animals, and when officials of the supreme court\r\nwere condemned to confinement for having taken no steps to prevent\r\ndog-fights, the citizens began to appreciate that the shogun was in\r\ngrim earnest. A huge kennel was then constructed in the Nakano suburb\r\nof Yedo as a shelter for homeless dogs. It covered an area of about\r\n138 acres, furnished accommodation for a thousand dogs, and was under\r\nthe management of duly appointed officials, while the citizens had to\r\ncontribute to a dog-fund, concerning which it was said that a dog's\r\nration for a day would suffice a man for a day and a half.\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi came to be spoken of as Inu-kubo (Dog-shogun), but all his\r\nmeasures did not bring him a son; neither did their failure shake his\r\nsuperstitious credulity. Solemn prayers were offered again and again\r\nwith stately pomp and profuse circumstance, and temple after temple\r\nwas built or endowed at enormous cost, while the laws against taking\r\nanimal life continued in force more vigorously than ever. Birds and\r\neven shell-fish were included in the provisions, and thus not only\r\nwere the nation's foodstuffs diminished, but also its crops lay at\r\nthe mercy of destructive animals and birds. It is recorded that a\r\npeasant was exiled for throwing a stone at a pigeon, and that one man\r\nwas put to death for catching fish with hook and line, while another\r\nmet the same fate for injuring a dog, the head of the criminal being\r\nexposed on the public execution ground and a neighbour who had\r\nreported the offence being rewarded with thirty ryo. We read, also,\r\nof officials sentenced to transportation for clipping a horse or\r\nfurnishing bad provender. The annals relate a curious story connected\r\nwith these legislative excesses. The Tokugawa baron of Mito, known in\r\nhistory as Komon Mitsukuni, on receiving evidence as to the\r\nmonstrous severity with which the law protecting animals was\r\nadministered, collected a large number of men and organized a hunting\r\nexpedition on a grand scale. Out of the animals killed, twenty dogs\r\nof remarkable size were selected, and their skins having been\r\ndressed, were packed in a case for transmission to Yanagisawa\r\nYoshiyasu, whom people regarded as chiefly responsible for the\r\nshogun's delirium. The messengers to whom the box was entrusted were\r\nordered to travel with all speed, and, on arriving in Yedo, to repair\r\nforthwith to the Yanagisawa mansion, there handing over the skins\r\nwith a written statement that the Mito baron, having found such\r\narticles useful in the cold season, availed himself of this\r\nopportunity to submit his experience together with a parcel of\r\ndressed hides to the shogun through Yoshiyasu. It is said that the\r\nrecipient of this sarcastic gift conceived a suspicion of the Mito\r\nbaron's sanity and sent a special envoy to examine his condition.\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nIn the sequel of this corrupt administration, this constant building\r\nof temples, and this profusion of costly ceremonials, the shogun's\r\nGovernment found itself seriously embarrassed for money. Ieyasu had\r\nalways made frugality and economy his leading principles. He had\r\nescaped the heavy outlays to which his fellow barons were condemned\r\nin connexion with the Korean campaign, since his share in the affair\r\ndid not extend beyond collecting a force in the province of Hizen.\r\nThroughout his life he devoted much attention to amassing a reserve\r\nfund, and it is said that when he resigned the shogunate to his son,\r\nhe left 150,000 gold oban (one and a half million ryo), and nearly\r\ntwo million ounces (troy) of silver in the treasury. Further, during\r\nhis retirement at Sumpu, he saved a sum of one million ryo. The same\r\neconomy was practised by the second shogun, although he was compelled\r\nto spend large sums in connexion with his daughter's promotion to be\r\nthe Emperor's consort, as well as on the repairs of Yedo Castle and\r\non his several progresses to Kyoto. On the occasion of these\r\nprogresses, Hidetada is said to have distributed a total of 4.217,400\r\nryo of gold and 182,000 ryo of silver among the barons throughout the\r\nempire. The third shogun, Iemitsu, was open handed. We find him\r\nmaking frequent donations of 5000 kwamme of silver to the citizens of\r\nKyoto and Yedo; constructing the inner castle at Yedo twice; building\r\na huge warship; entertaining the Korean ambassadors with much pomp;\r\ndisbursing 400,000 ryo on account of the Shimabara insurrection, and\r\ndevoting a million ryo to the construction and embellishment of the\r\nmausolea at Nikko. Nevertheless, on the whole Iemitsu must be\r\nregarded as an economical ruler.\r\n\r\nAs for his successor, Ietsuna, he had to deal with several calamitous\r\noccurrences. After the great fire in Yedo, he contributed 160,000 ryo\r\nfor the relief of the sufferers; he rebuilt Yedo Castle, and he\r\nreconstructed the Imperial palace of Kyoto twice. In the Empo era\r\n(1673-1680), the country was visited by repeated famines, which had\r\nthe effect of reducing the yield of the taxes and calling for large\r\nmeasures of relief. In these circumstances, a proposal was formally\r\nsubmitted recommending the debasement of the gold coinage, but it\r\nfailed to obtain official consent. It may be mentioned that, in the\r\nyear 1659, the treasury was reduced to ashes, and a quantity of gold\r\ncoin contained therein was melted. With this bullion a number of gold\r\npieces not intended for ordinary circulation were cast, and stamped\r\nupon them were the words, \"To be used only in cases of national\r\nemergency.\" The metal thus reserved is said to have amounted to\r\n160,000 ryo. The register shows that when the fifth shogun succeeded\r\nto power, there were 3,850,000 gold ryo in the treasury. But this\r\nenormous sum did not long survive the extravagance of Tsunayoshi.\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination of Hotta Masatoshi, the administrative power\r\nfell entirely into the hands of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, and the example\r\nset by him for those under his guidance, and by his master, the\r\nshogun, soon found followers among all classes of the people. As an\r\ninstance of ludicrous luxury it may be mentioned that the timbers\r\nintended for the repair of the castle in Yedo were wrapped in wadded\r\nquilts when transported to the city from the forest. Finally, the\r\ntreasury became so empty that, when the shogun desired to repair to\r\nthe mausolea at Nikko, which would have involved a journey of ten\r\ndays at the most, he was compelled to abandon the idea, as the\r\nofficials of the treasury declared themselves unable to find the\r\nnecessary funds. That sum was calculated at 100,000 ryo, or about as\r\nmany pounds sterling, which fact is alone sufficient to convey an\r\nidea of the extravagance practised in everything connected with the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe immediate outcome of this incident was the summoning of a council\r\nto discuss the financial situation, and after much thought the\r\nsuggestion of Hagiwara Shigehide, chief of the Treasury, was\r\naccepted, namely, wholesale debasement of the gold, silver, and\r\ncopper coins. The old pieces, distinguished as \"Keicho coins,\" that\r\nbeing the name of the year period (1596-1614) when they were minted,\r\nwere replaced by greatly inferior \"Genroku coins\" (1688-1703), with\r\nthe natural results--appreciation of commodities and much forging of\r\ncounterfeit coins. Presently the Government is found levying a tax\r\nupon 27,200 sake brewers within the Kwanto, and, in 1703, fresh\r\nexpedients became necessary to meet outlays incurred owing to a great\r\nearthquake and conflagration which destroyed a large part of Yedo\r\nCastle and of the daimyo's mansions. Further debasement of the\r\ncurrency was resorted to, the new coins being distinguished by the\r\nterm \"Hoei,\" after the name of the year-period when they were\r\nminted.\r\n\r\nAbout this time several of the feudatories found themselves in such\r\nstraits that they began to issue paper currency within their\r\ndominions, and this practice having been interdicted by the Bakufu,\r\nthe daimyo fell back upon the expedient of levying forced loans from\r\nwealthy merchants in Osaka. Meanwhile, the crime of forgery became so\r\nprevalent that, in the interval between 1688 and 1715, no less than\r\n541 counterfeiters were crucified within the districts under the\r\ndirect control of the Bakufu., The feudatory of Satsuma is credited\r\nwith having justly remarked that the victims of this cruel fate\r\nsuffered for their social status rather than for their offence\r\nagainst the law, the real counterfeiters being Yanagisawa and\r\nHagiwara, who were engaged continuously in uttering debased coins.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted in behalf of the financiers of that era that\r\ntheir difficulties were much accentuated by natural calamities. The\r\ndestructive earthquake of 1703 was followed, in 1707, by an eruption\r\nof Fuji, with the result that in the three provinces of Musashi,\r\nSagami, and Suruga, considerable districts were buried in ashes to\r\nthe depth of ten feet, so that three years and a heavy expenditure\r\nof, money were required to restore normal conditions. Thenceforth the\r\nstate of the Bakufu treasury went from bad to worse. Once again\r\nHagiwara Shigehide had recourse to adulteration of the coinage. This\r\ntime he tampered mainly with the copper tokens, but owing to the\r\nunwieldy and impure character of these coins, very great difficulty\r\nwas experienced in putting them into circulation, and the Bakufu\r\nfinanciers finally were obliged to fall back upon the reserve of gold\r\nkept in the treasury for special contingencies. There can be no doubt\r\nthat Japan's foreign trade contributed materially to her financial\r\nembarrassment, but this subject will be subsequently dealt with.\r\n\r\nTSUNAYOSHI'S FAVOURITE\r\n\r\nWhen Tsunayoshi became shogun, Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu occupied the\r\nposition of a low-class squire in the shogun's household and was in\r\nreceipt of a salary of three hundred koku yearly. Four years later,\r\nhe received the title of Dewa no Kami and his revenue was increased\r\nto 100,000 koku. Finally, in 1703, he was appointed daimyo of Kai\r\nprovince and came into the enjoyment of a total income of 150,000\r\nkoku. This was the more remarkable inasmuch as, owing to the\r\nstrategical importance of Kai, it had been reserved as a fief for one\r\nof the Tokugawa family, and its bestowal on a complete outsider was\r\nequivalent to the admission of the latter into the Tokugawa circle.\r\nThis remarkable promotion in rank and income shows how completely the\r\nshogun had fallen under the influence of his favourite, Yoshiyasu,\r\nwho exhibited wonderful skill in appealing at once to the passions\r\nand to the intellect of his master. Some historians of the time\r\nrelate that the shogun's infatuation betrayed him into promising to\r\nraise Yoshiyasu's revenue to a million koku, and to nominate as\r\nsuccessor to the shogunate a son borne by Yoshiyasu's wife to\r\nTsunayoshi; but according to tradition, these crowning extravagances\r\nwere averted on the very night preceding the day of their intended\r\nconsummation, the shogun being stabbed to death by his wife, who\r\nimmediately committed suicide. This tale, however, has been shown to\r\nbe an invention with no stronger foundation than the fact that\r\nTsunayoshi's death took place very suddenly at a highly critical\r\ntime. It is not to be doubted that many of the excesses and\r\nadministrative blunders committed by the fifth Tokugawa shogun were\r\ndue to the pernicious influence of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu.\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF THE SAMURAI SPIRIT\r\n\r\nThe no dance was among the indulgences which Tsunayoshi affected and\r\namong the accomplishments in which he himself excelled. He took into\r\nhis service a number of skilled dancers of the no, and treated them\r\nas hereditary vassals, setting aside the chamber of the Paulownia for\r\ntheir use. These performers, whatever their origin, received the\r\ntreatment of samurai, and their dainty posturing in the dance became\r\na model for the lords of the Bakufu Court, so that the simple\r\ndemeanour of military canons was replaced by a mincing and\r\nmeretricious mien. Another favourite dance in Yedo Castle was the\r\nfuryu. A book of the period describes the latter performance in these\r\nterms: \"Sixteen youths made their appearance; they all wore\r\nwide-sleeved robes and purple figured silk with embroidery of oak\r\nleaves in gold and silver threads. They carried two swords with gold\r\nmountings and scarlet tassels, so that when they danced in harmony\r\nwith the flutes and drums the spectacle presented was one of dazzling\r\nbrilliancy.\" Thenceforth this \"Genroku dance,\" as it came to be\r\ncalled, obtained wide vogue. The same is true of the joruri, which is\r\none of the most emotional forms of chant. Hitherto the samisen had\r\nbeen regarded as a vulgar instrument, and its use had never received\r\nthe sanction of aristocratic circles. But it now came into favour\r\nwith all classes of women from the highest to the lowest, and the\r\nsinging of the joruri was counted a far more important accomplishment\r\nthan any kind of domestic education.\r\n\r\nSuch an appeal to the emotional side of human nature could not fail\r\nto undermine the stoicism of the samurai and the morality of society\r\nin general. The practice of the military arts went out of fashion,\r\nand it became an object with the bushi not only to have his sword\r\nhighly ornamented, but also to adapt its dimensions to the fashion of\r\nthe moment, thus sacrificing utility to elegance. In short, the\r\nGenroku era (1688-1703) was essentially a time of luxury and\r\nextravagance, its literature abounding in theatrical plays, songs,\r\nverses, and joruri, and its ideals involving the sacrifice of the\r\nnoble to the elegant. Men were promoted in rank not merely because\r\nthey could dance gracefully, but also because they made themselves\r\nconspicuous for kindness to dogs, in obedience to the shogun's\r\nfoible, and as many of these men had not learned to ride on horseback\r\nthey petitioned for permission to use palanquins. This marked a\r\nsignal departure from the severe rules of former days. Street\r\npalanquins (machi-kago) ultimately came into use by all who could\r\nafford the luxury. In short, the ancient order of educational\r\nprecedence was reversed, and polite accomplishments took the place of\r\nmilitary science.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: FORTY-SEVEN RONIN\r\n\r\nTHE AKO VENDETTA\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this degenerate era produced one of the most remarkable\r\nacts of self-sacrificing loyalty that stand to the credit of Japanese\r\nsamurai. On the 7th of February, 1703, forty-seven bushi, under the\r\nleadership of Oishi Yoshio, forced their way into the mansion of Kira\r\nYoshihide; killed him in order to avenge the death of their feudal\r\nchief, Asano Naganori, daimyo of Ako; and then surrendered themselves\r\nto justice. Under the title of The Forty-seven Ronins, this story has\r\nbeen told in history, on the stage, and in all forms of literature,\r\nso that its details need not be repeated here. It will suffice to say\r\nthat, under great provocation, the Ako feudatory drew his sword in\r\nthe precincts of Yedo Castle and cut down Kira Yoshihide, for which\r\nbreach of court etiquette rather than for the deed of violence, the\r\nAko baron was condemned to commit suicide and his estates were\r\nconfiscated. Thereupon, forty-seven of his principal vassals pledged\r\nthemselves to wreak vengeance, and, after nearly two years of\r\nplanning and watching, they finally succeeded in achieving their\r\npurpose. Degenerate as was the spirit of the time, this bold deed\r\naroused universal admiration. The vendetta was not illegal in Japan.\r\nIt had been practised from medieval times and often with direct\r\nsanction of the authorities. But in no circumstances was it\r\nofficially permissible within the cities of Kyoto, Yedo, Osaka, and\r\nSumpu, or in the vicinity of the shogun's shrines. The forty-seven\r\nronins had therefore committed a capital crime. Yet they had only\r\nobeyed the doctrine of Confucius, and the shogun therefore\r\nendeavoured to save their lives. More than a year was spent\r\ndiscussing the issue, and it is recorded that Tsunayoshi appealed to\r\nthe prince-abbot of Ueno in order to secure his intervention in the\r\ncause of leniency. The day was ultimately carried by the advocates of\r\nstern justice, and the forty-seven ronins were ordered to commit\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed without a murmur. One of them, Terasaka Kichiemon by\r\nname, had been sent to carry the news to Ako immediately after the\r\nperpetration of the deed of vengeance. He returned when his comrades\r\nwere condemned and gave himself up to the authorities, but they\r\ndeclined to punish him on the ground that the case had already been\r\ndisposed of. The eminent Confucian scholar, Hayashi Nobuatsu,\r\npetitioned for the pardon of the ronins, and the scarcely less\r\ncelebrated Muro Kyuso compiled a book describing the incident; but,\r\nfor some reason never fully explained, the noteworthy scholar, Ogyu\r\nSorai, took the opposite side. One act of the authorities is eloquent\r\nas to the sentiment prevailing at the time. They condemned\r\nYoshihide's son, Yoshikata, to be deprived of his ancestral domain\r\nfor not having died in company with his father. As for the feeling of\r\nthe nation at large, it was abundantly manifested by many of the\r\ngreat feudatories, who vied with one another in conferring offices\r\nand revenues on the sons and grandsons of the \"Forty-seven.\"\r\n\r\nYAMAGA SOKO\r\n\r\nThe affair of the forty-seven ronins helped to bring into eminence\r\nthe name of Yamaga Soko, a firm believer in Confucianism and an\r\nardent follower of military science. Amid an environment of\r\nunfavourable conditions Soko preached the cult of bushido, and was\r\nthe first to embody that philosophy in a written system. His\r\nbooks--the Shi-do (Way of the Warrior) and Bukyo Shogaku (Military\r\nPrimer)--contain minute instructions as to the practice and the\r\nmorale of the samurai. Soko rejected the Chutsz interpretation, then\r\nin vogue, of the Chinese classics, and insisted on the pure doctrine\r\nof the ancient sages, so that he found himself out of touch with the\r\neducational spirit of the time. Thus, falling under the displeasure\r\nof the Bakufu, he was charged with propagating heterodox views and\r\nwas sent to Ako to be kept in custody by Asano Naganori, who treated\r\nhim throughout with courtesy and respect. In return, Soko devoted his\r\nwhole energy during nineteen years to the education of the Ako\r\nvassals, and the most prominent of the Forty-seven Ronins was among\r\nhis pupils.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH SHOGUN, IENOBU\r\n\r\nTsunayoshi died of small-pox in 1709, after a brief illness. He had\r\nno son, and: five years previously, his nephew Ienobu (third son of\r\nhis deceased elder brother, Tsunashige) had been declared heir to the\r\nshogunate. Having been born in 1662, Ienobu was in his forty-seventh\r\nyear when he succeeded to the office of shogun. His first act was to\r\nabolish Tsunayoshi's legislation for the protection of animals. He is\r\nsaid to have offered the following explanation at the tomb of the\r\ndeceased shogun: \"You desired to protect living animals and strictly\r\ninterdicted the slaughter of any such. You willed that even after\r\nyour death the prohibition should be observed. But hundreds of\r\nthousands of human beings are suffering from the operation of your\r\nlaw. To repeal it is the only way of bringing peace to the nation.\"\r\n\r\nARAI HAKUSEKI\r\n\r\nIenobu gave evidence of his sagacity by dismissing Yanagisawa\r\nYoshiyasu, the corrupt favourite of the late shogun; by appointing in\r\nhis stead Manabe Norifusa to the office of personal assistant (soba\r\nyoniri), and by reposing full confidence in Arai Hakuseki. This last\r\nis recognized by posterity as the most distinguished among Japanese\r\nConfucianists. He studied the literature of both the Tang and the\r\nSung dynasties, and he laboured to apply the precepts of Chinese\r\nphilosophy to the practical needs of his own country. Moreover, he\r\ndevoted exceptional attention to the conditions existing in\r\nOccidental States, and he embodied his thoughts and researches on the\r\nlatter subject in a book called Sairan Igen, the first treatise of\r\nits kind published in Japan.\r\n\r\nA practical illustration of his knowledge was furnished in connexion\r\nwith the reception of Korean envoys. It had been customary to convey\r\nto these officials an imposing conception of Japanese magnificence by\r\ntreating them with lavish hospitality. Hakuseki was able to detect\r\nthat the conduct of the envoys violated in many respects the rules of\r\nChinese etiquette, and having obtained the shogun's nomination to\r\nreceive the envoy, Cho, he convinced the latter that there must be no\r\nmore neglect of due formalities. He then memorialized the shogun in\r\nthe sense that these Korean ambassadors were merely Chinese spies,\r\nand that instead of receiving a lavish welcome, they should be\r\nrequired to limit their journey to the island of Tsushima, where only\r\na very restricted ceremonial should be performed in their honour.\r\nThis shrewd, though somewhat conservative, suggestion elicited\r\ngeneral approval, but was not carried into effect until the time of\r\nthe eleventh shogun.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: ARAI HAKUSEKI\r\n\r\nADJUSTMENT OF THE FINANCES\r\n\r\nIt has been shown above that the fifth shogun bequeathed to his\r\nsuccessor a much embarrassed treasury. In this realm, also, the\r\nadvice of Arai Hakuseki proved invaluable. In his volume of\r\nreminiscences there is an interesting statement connected with\r\nfinance. It quotes Hagiwara Shigehide, commissioner of the Treasury,\r\nas saying that the shogun's estate at that time yielded four million\r\nkoku annually, in addition to which there accrued from 760,000 ryo to\r\n770,000 ryo in money, representing the proceeds of dues and taxes. In\r\nthis latter sum was included 40,000 ryo, customs duties collected at\r\nNagasaki, and 6000 ryo yielded by a tax on sake. The same report\r\nmentions that a sum of 160,000 ryo had been expended in clearing away\r\nthe volcanic ashes which fell in the three provinces of Musashi,\r\nSagami, and Suruga after the great eruption of Fujisan. Arai Hakuseki\r\nwas able to prove the erroneous character of this report, but his\r\ndemonstration did not impugn any of the above figures. Incidentally\r\nit is mentioned in Arai's comments that 700,000 ryo were allotted for\r\nbuilding an addition to Yedo Castle, and 200,000 ryo for the\r\nconstruction of the deceased shogun's mausoleum, out of which total\r\nHakuseki explicitly charges the officials, high and low alike, with\r\ndiverting large sums to their own pockets in collusion with the\r\ncontractors and tradesmen employed on the works. Another interesting\r\ninvestigation made by Arai Hakuseki is in connexion with the\r\ncountry's foreign trade. He showed that the amount of coins exported\r\nfrom Nagasaki alone, during one year, totalled 6,192,800 ryo of gold;\r\n1,122,687 kwamme of silver and 228,000,000 kin of copper.* He alleged\r\nthat the greater part of this large outflow of specie produced\r\nnothing except luxuries with which the nation could very well\r\ndispense, and he therefore advised that the foreign trade of Nagasaki\r\nshould be limited to thirteen Chinese junks and two Dutch vessels\r\nannually, while stringent measures should be adopted to prevent\r\nsmuggling.\r\n\r\n*One kin equals 1.25 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance based upon this advice consisted of two hundred\r\narticles, and is known in history as the \"New Nagasaki Trade Rules of\r\nthe Shotoku Era\" (1711-1715). One portion of the document ran as\r\nfollows: \"During the Jokyo era (1684-1687), the trade with Chinese\r\nmerchants was limited to 6000 kwamme of silver, and that with Dutch\r\ntraders to 50,000 ryo of gold, while the number of Chinese vessels\r\nwas not allowed to exceed seventy per annum. After a few years,\r\nhowever, copper coins came into use as media of exchange in addition\r\nto silver, and moreover there was much smuggling of foreign goods.\r\nThus, it resulted that gold, silver, and copper flowed out of the\r\ncountry in great quantities. Comparing the aggregate thus exported\r\nduring the 107 years since the Keicho era with the amount coined in\r\nJapan during the same interval, it is found that one-quarter of the\r\ngold coins and three-quarters of the silver left the country. If that\r\nstate of affairs continue, it is obvious that after a hundred years\r\nfrom the present time one-half of the empire's gold will be carried\r\naway and there will be no silver at all left. As for copper, the sum\r\nremaining in the country is insufficient, not only for purposes of\r\ntrade but also for the needs of everyday life. It is most regrettable\r\nthat the nation's treasure should thus be squandered upon foreign\r\nluxuries. The amount of currency needed at home and the amount\r\nproduced by the mines should be investigated so as to obtain a basis\r\nfor limiting the foreign trade at the open ports of Nagasaki,\r\nTsushima, and Satsuma, and for fixing the maximum number of foreign\r\nvessels visiting those places.\"\r\n\r\nIMPEACHMENT OF HAGIWARA SHIGEHIDE\r\n\r\nIn connexion with Arai Hakuseki's impeachment of the Treasury\r\ncommissioner, Hagiwara Shigehide, it was insisted that an auditor's\r\noffice must be re-established, and it was pointed out that the yield\r\nof rice from the shogun's estates had fallen to 28.9 per cent, of the\r\ntotal produce instead of being forty per cent., as fixed by law.\r\nNevertheless, the condition of the farmers was by no means improved,\r\nand the inevitable inference was that the difference went into the\r\npockets of the local officials. Similarly, enormous expenses were\r\nincurred for the repair of river banks without any corresponding\r\ndiminution of floods, and hundreds of thousands of bags of rice went\r\nnominally to the bottom of the sea without ever having been shipped.\r\nDuring the year that followed the reconstruction of the auditor's\r\noffice, the yield of the estates increased by 433,400 bags of rice,\r\nand the cost of riparian works decreased by 38,000 ryo of gold,\r\nwhile, at the same time, the item of shipwrecked cereals disappeared\r\nalmost completely from the ledgers. In consequence of these charges\r\nthe commissioner, Shigehide, was dismissed. History says that\r\nalthough his regular salary was only 3000 koku annually, he embezzled\r\n260,000 ryo of gold by his debasement of the currency, and that\r\nultimately he starved himself to death in token of repentance.\r\n\r\nIenobu and his able adviser, Hakuseki, desired to restore the\r\ncurrency to the system pursued in the Keicho era (1596-1614), but\r\ntheir purpose was thwarted by insufficiency of the precious metals.\r\nThey were obliged to be content with improving the quality of the\r\ncoins while decreasing their weight by one half. These new tokens\r\nwere called kenji-kin, as they bore on the reverse the ideograph ken,\r\nsignifying \"great original.\" The issue of the new coins took place\r\nin the year 1710, and at the same time the daimyo were strictly\r\nforbidden to issue paper currency, which veto also was imposed at the\r\nsuggestion of Arai Hakuseki.\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH SHOGUN, IETSUGU\r\n\r\nThe seventh Tokugawa shogun, Ietsugu, son of his predecessor, Ienobu,\r\nwas born in 1709, succeeded to the shogunate in April, 1713, and died\r\nin 1716. His father, Ienobu, died on the 13th of November, 1712, so\r\nthat there was an interval of five months between the demise of the\r\nsixth shogun and the accession of the seventh. Of course, a child of\r\nfour years who held the office of shogun for the brief period of\r\nthree years could not take any part in the administration or have any\r\nvoice in the appointment or dismissal of officials. Thus, Arai\r\nHakuseki's tenure of office depended upon his relations with the\r\nother ministers, and as all of these did not approve his drastic\r\nreforms, he was obliged to retire, but Manabe Norifusa remained in\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TOKUGAWA YOSHIMUNE\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH SHOGUN, YOSHIMUNE\r\n\r\nBy the death of Ietsugu, in 1716, the Hidetada line of the Tokugawa\r\nfamily became extinct, and a successor to the shogunate had to be\r\nsought from the Tokugawa of Kii province in the person of Yoshimune,\r\ngrandson of Yorinobu and great-grandson of Ieyasu. Born in 1677,\r\nYoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa shogun, succeeded to office in 1716,\r\nat the age of thirty-nine. The son of a concubine, he had been\r\nobliged to subsist on the proceeds of a very small estate, and he\r\ntherefore well understood the uses of economy and the condition of\r\nthe people. His habits were simple and plain, and he attached as much\r\nimportance as Ieyasu himself had done to military arts and literary\r\npursuits. It had become a custom on the occasion of each shogun's\r\nsuccession to issue a decree confirming, expanding, or altering the\r\nsystems of the previous potentate. Yoshimune's first decree placed\r\nspecial emphasis on the necessity of diligence in the discharge of\r\nadministrative functions and the eschewing of extravagance. Always he\r\nmade it his unflagging aim to restore the martial spirit which had\r\nbegun to fade from the samurai's bosom, and in the forefront of\r\nimportant reforms he placed frugality. The Bakufu had fallen into the\r\nhabit of modelling their systems and their procedure after Kyoto\r\nexamples. In fact, they aimed at converting Yedo into a replica of\r\nthe Imperial capital. This, Yoshimune recognized as disadvantageous\r\nto the Bakufu themselves and an obstacle to the resuscitation of\r\nbushido. Therefore, he set himself to restore all the manners and\r\ncustoms of former days, and it became his habit to preface decrees\r\nand ordinances with the phrase \"In pursuance of the methods, fixed\r\nby Gongen\" (Ieyasu). His idea was that only the decadence of bushido\r\ncould result from imitating the habits of the Imperial Court, and as\r\nManabe Norifusa did not endorse that view with sufficient zeal, the\r\nshogun relieved him of his office of minister of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nOne of Yoshimune's measures was to remodel the female department of\r\nthe palace on the lines of simplicity and economy. All the\r\nladies-in-waiting were required to furnish a written oath against\r\nextravagance and irregular conduct of every kind, and in the sixth\r\nyear after his accession the shogun ordered that a list should be\r\nfurnished setting forth the names and ages of such of these ladies as\r\nwere, conspicuously beautiful. Fifty were deemed worthy of\r\ninscription, and quite a tremor of joyful excitement was caused, the\r\nmeasure being regarded as prefacing the shogun's choice of consorts.\r\nBut Yoshimune's purpose was very different. He discharged all these\r\nfair-faced ladies and kept only the ill-favoured ones, his assigned\r\nreason being that as ugly females find a difficulty in getting\r\nhusbands, it would be only charitable to retain their services.\r\n\r\nHe revived the sport of hawking, after the manner of Ieyasu, for he\r\ncounted it particularly suitable to soldiers; and he pursued the\r\npastime so ardently that men gave him the name of the Taka-shogun\r\n(Falcon shogun). He also inaugurated a new game called uma-gari\r\n(horse-hunting); and it is on record that he required the samurai to\r\npractise swimming in the sea. By way of giving point to his\r\nordinances inculcating frugality, he himself made a habit of wearing\r\ncotton garments in winter and hempen in summer--a custom habitually\r\npractised by the lower orders only. The very detailed nature of his\r\neconomical measures is illustrated by an incident which has\r\nindependent interest. Observing that the fences erected on the scarp\r\nof Yedo Castle were virtually useless for purposes of defence and\r\nvery costly to keep in repair, he caused them all to be pulled down\r\nand replaced by pine trees. This happened in 1721, and the result was\r\nthat the battlements of this great castle were soon overhung by noble\r\ntrees, which softened and beautified the military aspect of the\r\ncolossal fortress. To the same shogun Yedo owes the cherry and plum\r\ngroves of Asuka-yama, of the Sumida-gawa, and of Koganei. The\r\nsaplings of these trees were taken from the Fukiage park, which\r\nremains to-day one of the most attractive landscape gardens in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS OF WOMEN, KYOHO ERA\r\n\r\nOTHER MEASURES\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of acquiring accurate information about the condition\r\nof the people, Yoshimune appointed officials who went by the name of\r\nniwa-ban (garden watchmen). They moved about among the lower orders\r\nand reported everything constituting knowledge useful for\r\nadministrative purposes. Moreover, to facilitate the ends of justice,\r\nthe shogun revived the ancient device of petition-boxes\r\n(meyasu-bako), which were suspended in front of the courthouse in\r\norder that men might lodge there a written statement of all\r\ncomplaints. It was by Yoshimune, also, that the celebrated Ooka\r\nTadasuke, the \"Solomon of Japan,\" was invited from Yamada and\r\nappointed chief justice in Yedo. The judgments delivered by him in\r\nthat capacity will be famous as long as Japan exists. It has to be\r\nnoted, however, that the progressive spirit awakened by Yoshimune's\r\nadministration was not without untoward results. Extremists fell into\r\nthe error of believing that everything pertaining to the canons of\r\nthe immediate past must be abandoned, and they carried this\r\nconception into the realm of foreign trade, so that the restrictions\r\nimposed in the Shotoku era (1711-1715) were neglected. It became\r\nnecessary to issue a special decree ordering the enforcement of these\r\nregulations, although, as will presently be seen, Yoshimune's\r\ndisposition towards the civilization of the Occident was essentially\r\nliberal.\r\n\r\nCODES OF LAW\r\n\r\nBy this time the miscarriages of justice liable to occur when the law\r\nis administered with regard to precedent only or mainly, began to be\r\nplainly observable, and the shogun, appreciating the necessity for\r\nwritten codes, appointed a commission to collect and collate the laws\r\nin operation from ancient times; to embody them in codes, and to\r\nillustrate them by precedents. Matsudaira Norimura, one of the\r\nministers of State, was appointed chief commissioner, and there\r\nresulted, after four years of labour, the first genuine Japanese code\r\n(Oshioki Ojomoku). This body of laws was subsequently revised by\r\nMatsudaira Sadanobu, and under the name of Osadame Hyakkajo (\"Hundred\r\nArticles of Law\"), it remained long in practice.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE\r\n\r\nYoshimune was not behind any of his ancestors in appreciation of\r\nlearning. In 1721, when his administrative reforms were still in\r\ntheir infancy, he invited to Yedo Kinoshita Torasuke (son of the\r\ncelebrated Kinoshita Junan), Muro Nawokiyo, and other eminent men of\r\nletters, and appointed them to give periodical lectures. Nawokiyo was\r\nnamed \"adviser to the shogun,\" who consulted him about administrative\r\naffairs, just as Arai Hakuseki had been consulted by Ienobu. In fact,\r\nit was by the advice of Arai Hakuseki that Nawokiyo (whose literary\r\nname was Kyuso), entered the service of Yoshimune. Contemporaneous\r\nwith these littérateurs was the renowned Ogyu Sorai, whose profound\r\nknowledge of finance and of administrative affairs in general made\r\nhim of great value to the Bakufu. He compiled a book called Seidan\r\n(Talks on Government) which, immediately became a classic. Special\r\nfavour was shown to the renowned Confucianist, Hayashi Nobuatsu. He\r\nand his son were asked to deliver regular lectures at the Shohei\r\nCollege, and these lectures were the occasion of a most important\r\ninnovation, namely, the admission of all classes of people, whereas\r\npreviously the audience at such discourses had been strictly limited\r\nto military men.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that in the days of Yoshimune's shogunate the\r\nphilosophy of Chutsz (Shu-shi) was preferred to all others. It\r\nreceived the official imprimatur, the philosophy of Wang Yang-ming (O\r\nYo-mei) being set aside. One consequence of this selection was that\r\nthe Hayashi family came to be regarded as the sole depositories of\r\ntrue Confucianism. Yoshimune himself, however, was not disposed to\r\nset any dogmatic limits to the usefulness of men of learning. He\r\nassumed an absolutely impartial attitude towards all schools;\r\nadopting the good wherever it was found, and employing talent to\r\nwhatever school it belonged. Thus when Kwanno Chqkuyo established a\r\nplace of education in Yedo, and Nakai Seishi did the same in Osaka,\r\nliberal grants of land were made by the Bakufu to both men. Another\r\nstep taken by the shogun was to institute a search for old books\r\nthroughout the country, and to collect manuscripts which had been\r\nkept in various families for generations. By causing these to be\r\ncopied or printed, many works which would otherwise have been\r\ndestroyed or forgotten were preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that all this admirable industry had one untoward\r\nresult: Japanese literature came into vogue in the Imperial capital,\r\nand was accompanied by the development of a theory that loyalty to\r\nthe sovereign was inconsistent with the administration of the Bakufu.\r\nThe far-reaching consequences of this conception will be dealt with\r\nin a later chapter. Here, it is sufficient to say that one of the\r\ngreatest and most truly patriotic of the Tokugawa shoguns himself\r\nunwittingly sowed the seeds of disaffection destined to prove fatal\r\nto his own family.\r\n\r\nADOPTION OF WESTERN LEARNING\r\n\r\nYoshimune was fond of astronomy. He erected a telescope in the\r\nobservatory at Kanda, a sun-dial in the palace park, and a rain-gauge\r\nat the same place. By his orders a mathematician named Nakane Genkei\r\ntranslated the Gregorian calendar into Japanese, and Yoshimune,\r\nconvinced of the superior accuracy of the foreign system, would have\r\nsubstituted it for the Chinese then used in Japan, had not his\r\npurpose excited such opposition that he judged it prudent to desist.\r\nIt was at this time that the well-informed Nishikawa Masayasu and\r\nShibukawa Noriyasu were appointed Government astronomers.\r\n\r\nPreviously the only sources of information about foreign affairs had\r\nbeen the masters of the Dutch ships, the Dutch merchants, and the\r\nJapanese interpreters at Nagasaki. The importation of books from the\r\nOccident having been strictly forbidden by the third shogun, Iemitsu,\r\nYoshimune appreciated the disadvantage of such a restriction, and\r\nbeing convinced of the benefits to be derived from the study of\r\nforeign science and art, he rescinded the veto except in the case of\r\nbooks relating to Christianity. Thus, for the first time, Japanese\r\nstudents were brought into direct contact with the products of\r\nWestern intelligence. In 1744, Aoki Konyo received official orders to\r\nproceed to Nagasaki for the purpose of seeking instruction in Dutch\r\nfrom Dutch teachers. Shibukawa and Aoki are regarded as the pioneers\r\nof Occidental learning in Japan, and, in the year 1907, posthumous\r\nhonours were conferred on them by the reigning Emperor of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTHE SANKIN KOTAI\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the financial embarrassment of the\r\nBakufu in Yoshimune's time was as serious as it had been in his\r\npredecessor's days. Moreover, in 1718, the country was swept by a\r\nterrible tornado, and in 1720 and 1721, conflagrations reduced large\r\nsections of Yedo to ashes. Funds to succour the distressed people\r\nbeing imperatively needed, the shogun called upon all the feudatories\r\nto subscribe one hundred koku of rice for every ten thousand koku of\r\ntheir estates. By way of compensation for this levy he reduced to\r\nhalf a year the time that each feudal chief had to reside in Yedo.\r\nThis meant, of course, a substantial lessening of the great expenses\r\nentailed upon the feudatories by the sankin kotai system, and the\r\nrelief thus afforded proved most welcome to the daimyo and the shomyo\r\nalike. Yoshimune intended to extend this indulgence ultimately by\r\nreleasing the barons from the necessity of coming to Yedo more than\r\nonce in from three to five years, and, in return, he contemplated a\r\ncorresponding increase of the special levy of rice. But his ministers\r\nopposed the project on the ground that it would dangerously loosen\r\nthe ties between the feudatories and the Bakufu, and inasmuch as\r\nevents proved that this result threatened to accrue from even the\r\nmoderate indulgence granted by the shogun, not only was no extension\r\nmade but also, in 1731, the system of sankin kotai was restored to\r\nits original form. The experiment, indeed proved far from\r\nsatisfactory. The feudatories did not confine themselves to\r\nassertions of independence; they also followed the example of the\r\nBakufu by remitting some of the duties devolving on their retainers\r\nand requiring the latter to show their gratitude for the remissions\r\nby monetary payments. Nominally, these payments took the form of\r\nloans, but in reality the amount was deducted from the salaries of\r\nvassals. This pernicious habit remained in vogue among a section of\r\nthe feudatories, even after the sankin kotai had been restored to its\r\noriginal form.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL SALARIES\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times it had been the habit of the Bakufu to assign\r\nimportant offices to men who were in enjoyment of large hereditary\r\nincomes. This was mainly for financial reasons. Salaries were paid in\r\nthe form of additions to the hereditary estates in other words, the\r\nemoluments of office became permanent, and the charge upon the Bakufu\r\nbeing correspondingly increased, it was obviously expedient to fill\r\nhigh administrative posts with men already in possession of ample\r\nincomes. This system was radically changed by Yoshimune. He enacted\r\nthat a clear distinction should be made between temporary salary and\r\nhereditary income. Thenceforth, salary was to be received only during\r\nthe tenure of office and was to cease on laying down official\r\nfunctions. This reform had the effect not only of lightening the\r\nburden upon the Bakufu income, but also of opening high offices to\r\nable men without regard to their private fortunes.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS OF WOMEN, KYOHO EHA\r\n\r\nTHE CURRENCY\r\n\r\nFrom the first day of assuming administrative power, Yoshimune gave\r\nearnest thought to reform of the currency. His ambition was to\r\nrestore the gold and silver coins to the quality and sizes existing\r\nin the Keicho era. This he effected, though not on a sufficiently\r\nlarge scale. Each of the new coins was equal in intrinsic value to\r\ntwo of the corresponding kenji coins, and the circulation of the\r\nlatter was suspended, the new coins being called Kyoho-kin after the\r\nyear-name of the era (1716-1735) when they made their appearance. It\r\nwas a thoroughly wholesome measure, but the quality of the precious\r\nmetals available did not suffice. Thus, whereas the gold coins struck\r\nduring ten years of the Kyoho era totalled only 8,290,000 ryo, a\r\ncensus taken in 1732 showed a total population of 26,921,816.\r\nTherefore, the old coins could not be wholly withdrawn from\r\ncirculation, and people developed a tendency to hoard the new and\r\nmore valuable tokens.\r\n\r\nOther untoward effects also were produced. The shogun paid much\r\nattention to promoting agriculture and encouraging land reclamation,\r\nso that the yield of rice increased appreciably. But this proved by\r\nno means an unmixed blessing. Side by side with an increase in the\r\nquantity of rice appearing in the market, the operation of the new\r\ncurrency tended to depreciate prices, until a measure of grain which\r\ncould not have been bought at one time for less than two ryo became\r\npurchasable for one. In fact, the records show that a producer\r\nconsidered himself fortunate if he obtained half a ryo of gold for a\r\nkoku of rice. This meant an almost intolerable state of affairs for\r\nthe samurai who received his salary in grain and for the petty\r\nfarmer. Thus, a man whose income was three rations of rice annually,\r\nand who consequently had to live on 5.4 koku for a whole year, found\r\nthat when he set aside from three to four koku for food, there\r\nremained little more than one ryo of assets to pay for salt, fuel,\r\nclothes, and all the other necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nSo acute was the suffering of the samurai that a rice-exchange was\r\nestablished at Dojima, in Osaka, for the purpose of imparting some\r\nmeasure of stability to the price of the cereal. Just at this time\r\n(1732), the central and western provinces were visited by a famine\r\nwhich caused seventeen thousand deaths and reduced multitudes to the\r\nverge of starvation. The Bakufu rendered aid on a munificent scale,\r\nbut the price of rice naturally appreciated, and although this\r\nbrought relief to the military class, it was misconstrued by the\r\nlower orders as a result of speculation on 'Change. Riots resulted,\r\nand rice-merchants fearing to make purchases, the market price of the\r\ncereal fell again, so that farmers and samurai alike were plunged\r\ninto their old difficulties.\r\n\r\nUltimately, in 1735, the Bakufu inaugurated a system of officially\r\nfixed prices (osadame-soba), according to which 1.4 koku of rice had\r\nto be exchanged for one ryo of gold in Yedo, the Osaka rate being\r\nfixed at forty-two momme of silver for the same quantity of the\r\ncereal. Anyone violating this rule was fined ten momme of silver for\r\neach koku of rice purchased or sold by him. It is related that the\r\nosadame-soba was operative in name only, and that the merchants\r\nsecretly dealt in the cereal at much lower prices than those\r\nofficially fixed. The Yedo financiers now concluded that the quantity\r\nof currency in circulation was insufficient and its quality too good.\r\nAccordingly, the gold and silver coins were once more reminted,\r\nsmaller and less pure tokens being issued under the name of bunji-kin\r\nwith reference to the Genbun era (1736-1740) of their issue. Thus,\r\nthe reform of the currency, achieved with so much difficulty in the\r\nearly years of Yoshimune's administration, had to be abandoned, and\r\nthings reverted to their old plight.\r\n\r\nIf this difficulty operated so acutely under a ruler of Yoshimune's\r\ntalent, the confusion and disorder experienced when he withdrew his\r\nable hand from the helm of State may be imagined. The feudatories\r\nwere constantly distressed to find funds for supporting their Yedo\r\nmansions, as well as for carrying out the public works imposed on\r\nthem from time to time, and for providing the costly presents which\r\nhad become a recognized feature of ordinary and extraordinary\r\nintercourse. As an example of the luxury of the age, it may be\r\nmentioned that when the fifth shogun visited the Kaga baron, the\r\nlatter had to find a sum of a million ryo to cover the expenses\r\nincidental to receiving such a guest. In these circumstances, there\r\narose among the feudatories a habit of levying monetary contributions\r\nfrom wealthy persons in their fiefs, the accommodation thus afforded\r\nbeing repaid by permission to carry swords or by promotion in rank.\r\nThe poorer classes of samurai being increasingly distressed, they,\r\ntoo, borrowed money at high rates of interest from merchants and\r\nwealthy farmers, which loans they were generally unable to repay.\r\nUltimately, the Bakufu solved the situation partially by decreeing\r\nthat no lawsuit for the recovery of borrowed money should be\r\nentertained--a reversion to the tokusei system of the Ashikaga\r\nshoguns.\r\n\r\nOf course, credit was completely undermined by the issue of this\r\ndecree. It is strange that such conditions should have existed under\r\nsuch a ruler as Yoshimune. But even his strenuous influence did not\r\nsuffice to stem the current of the time. The mercantile instinct\r\npervaded all the transactions of every-day life. If a man desired to\r\nadopt a son, he attached much less importance to the latter's social\r\nstatus or personality than to the dimensions of his fortune, and thus\r\nit came about that the family names of petty feudatories were freely\r\nbought and sold. Yoshimune strictly interdicted this practice, but\r\nhis veto had no efficiency; wealthy farmers or merchants freely\r\npurchased their way into titled families. From this abuse to\r\nextortion of money by threats the interval was not long, and the\r\noutcome, where farmers were victims, took the form of agrarian riots.\r\nIt was to the merchants, who stood between the farmers and the\r\nsamurai, that fortune offered conspicuously favourable opportunities\r\nin these circumstances. The tradesmen of the era became the centre of\r\nextravagance and luxury, so that in a certain sense the history of\r\nthe Yedo Bakufu may be said to be the history of mercantile\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\nYoshimune devoted much attention to the encouragement of industrial\r\nprogress. Deeming that a large import of drugs and sugar caused a\r\nruinous drain of specie, he sent experts hither and thither through\r\nthe country to encourage the domestic production of these staples as\r\nwell as of vegetable wax. The feudatories, in compliance with his\r\nsuggestion, took similar steps, and from this time tobacco growing in\r\nSagami and Satsuma; the weaving industry in Kotsuke and Shimotsuke;\r\nsericulture in Kotsuke, Shinano, Mutsu, and Dewa; indigo cultivation\r\nin Awa; orange growing in Kii, and the curing of bonito in Tosa and\r\nSatsuma--all these began to flourish. Another feature of the time was\r\nthe cultivation of the sweet potato at the suggestion of Aoki Konyo,\r\nwho saw in this vegetable a unique provision against famine.\r\nIrrigation and drainage works also received official attention, as\r\ndid the reclamation of rice-growing areas and the storing of cereals.\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH SHOGUN, IESHIGE\r\n\r\nIn 1745, Yoshimune resigned his office to his son, Ieshige, who,\r\nhaving been born in 1702, was now in his forty-third year. Yoshimune\r\nhad three sons, Ieshige, Munetake, and Munetada. Of these the most\r\npromising was the second, Munetake, whose taste for literature and\r\nmilitary art almost equalled his father's. Matsudaira Norimura, prime\r\nminister, recognizing that Ieshige, who was weak, passionate, and\r\nself-willed, would not be able to fill worthily the high office of\r\nshogun, suggested to Yoshimune the advisability of nominating\r\nMunetake. But Yoshimune had his own programme. Ieshige's son, Ieharu,\r\nwas a very gifted youth, and Yoshimune reckoned on himself retaining\r\nthe direction of affairs for some years, so that Ieshige's functions\r\nwould be merely nominal until Ieharu became old enough to succeed to\r\nthe shogunate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to prevent complications and avert dangerous rivalry,\r\nYoshimune assigned to Munetake and Munetada residences within the\r\nTayasu and Hitotsubashi gates of the castle, respectively, gave the\r\nnames of these gates as family titles, and bestowed on each a revenue\r\nof one hundred thousand koku, together with the privilege of\r\nsupplying an heir to the shogunate in the event of failure of issue\r\nin the principal house of Tokugawa or in one of the \"Three Families.\"\r\nThe shogun, Ieshige, followed the same plan with his son, Yoshishige,\r\nand as the latter's residence was fixed within the Shimizu gate,\r\nthere came into existence \"Three Branch Families\" called the Sankyo,\r\nin supplement of the already existing Sanke.*\r\n\r\n*The present Princes Tokugawa are the representatives of the main\r\nline of the shogun; the Marquises Tokugawa, representatives of the\r\nSanke, and the Counts Tokugawa, of the Sankyo.\r\n\r\nOf course, the addition of the Shimizu family had the approval of\r\nYoshimune. In fact, the whole arrangement as to the Sankyo was an\r\nillustration of his faithful imitation of the institutions of Ieyasu.\r\nThe latter had created the Sanke, and Yoshimune created the Sankyo;\r\nIeyasu had resigned in favour of his son and had continued to\r\nadminister affairs from Sumpu, calling himself 0-gosho; Yoshimune\r\nfollowed his great ancestor's example in all these respects except\r\nthat he substituted the western part of Yedo Castle for Sumpu.\r\nIeshige's most salient characteristic was a passionate disposition.\r\nMen called him the \"short-tempered shogun\" (kanshaku kubo). He gave\r\nhimself up to debauchery, and being of delicate physique, his\r\nself-indulgence quickly undermined his constitution. So long as\r\nYoshimune lived, his strong hand held things straight, but after his\r\ndeath, in 1751, the incompetence of his son became very marked. He\r\nallowed himself to fall completely under the sway of his immediate\r\nattendants, and, among these, Tanuma Okitsugu succeeded in\r\nmonopolizing the evil opportunity thus offered. During nearly ten\r\nyears the reforms effected by Yoshimune steadily ceased to be\r\noperative, and when Ieshige resigned in 1760, the country had fallen\r\ninto many of the bad customs of the Genroku era.\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH SHOGUN, IEHARU\r\n\r\nAfter his abdication in 1760, Ieshige survived only fourteen months,\r\ndying, in 1761, at the age of fifty-one. He was succeeded, in 1760,\r\nby his son, Ieharu, who, having been born in 1737, was twenty-three\r\nyears old when he began to administer the country's affairs. One of\r\nhis first acts was to appoint Tanuma Okitsugu to be prime minister,\r\nbestowing on him a fief of fifty-seven thousand koku in the province\r\nof Totomi, and ordering him to construct a fortress there. At the\r\nsame time Okitsugu's son, Okitomo, received the rank of Yamato no\r\nKami and the office of junior minister. These two men became\r\nthenceforth the central figures in an era of maladministration and\r\ncorruption. So powerful and all-reaching was their influence that\r\npeople were wont to say, \"Even a bird on the wing could not escape\r\nthe Tanuma.\" The shogun was not morally incapable, but his\r\nintelligence was completely overshadowed by the devices of Okitsugu,\r\nwho took care that Ieharu should remain entirely ignorant of popular\r\nsentiment. Anyone attempting to let light into this state of darkness\r\nwas immediately dismissed. It is related of a vassal of Okitsugu that\r\nhe was found one day with three high officials of the shogun's court\r\nbusily engaged in applying a moxa to his foot. The three officials\r\nknew that their places depended on currying favour with this vassal;\r\nhow much more, then, with his master, Okitsugu! Everything went by\r\nbribery. Justice and injustice were openly bought and sold. Tanuma\r\nOkitsugu was wont to say that human life was not so precious as gold\r\nand silver; that by the liberality of a man's gifts his sincerity\r\nmight truly be gauged, and that the best solace for the trouble of\r\nconducting State affairs was for their administrator to find his\r\nhouse always full of presents.\r\n\r\nIeharu, however, knew nothing of all this, or anything of the natural\r\ncalamities that befell the country under his sway--the eruption of\r\nthe Mihara volcano, in 1779, when twenty feet of ashes were piled\r\nover the adjacent country through an area of several miles; the\r\nvolcanic disturbance at Sakura-jima, in Osumi, which took place about\r\nthe same time and ended in the creation of several new islands; the\r\noutbreak of the Asama crater, in 1783, when half the provinces of the\r\nKwanto were covered with ashes; and the loss of forty thousand lives\r\nby a flood in the Tone-gawa. Of all these visitations the shogun\r\nremained uninformed, and, in spite of them, luxury and extravagance\r\nmarked the lives of the upper classes. Many, however, were\r\nconstrained to seek loans from wealthy merchants in Osaka, and these\r\ntradesmen, admonished by past incidents, refused to lend anything. At\r\nlast the intolerable situation culminated in a deed of violence. In\r\nApril, 1784, Sano Masakoto, a hereditary vassal of the shogun, drew\r\nhis sword upon Okitsugu within the precincts of the castle in Yedo\r\nand wounded him severely. Masakoto was seized and sentenced to commit\r\nsuicide, but the justice of his attempt being recognized, the\r\ninfluence of Okitsugu and his son began to decline. Two years later\r\n(1786), there appeared a decree in the name of the Bakufu, ordering\r\nthat the temples in all the provinces, the farmers, the artisans, and\r\nthe merchants should send their gold and silver every spring to the\r\nCentral Government, to the end that the latter might lend this\r\ntreasure to the feudatories, who would pledge themselves to pay it\r\nback after five years.*\r\n\r\n*The funds thus obtained were called yuzu-kin (accommodation money).\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the shogun himself knew nothing of\r\nthis ordinance until a multitude of complaints and remonstrances\r\nfound their way, in part, to his ears. At all events, the\r\nextraordinary decree proved to be the last act of Okitsugu's official\r\nlife. He was dismissed from office, though whether the credit of that\r\nstep belongs to the Sanke and the elder officials or to the shogun,\r\nis not certain, for Ieharu is said to have died just before the final\r\ndisgrace of the corrupt statesman was consummated. The Yedo upon\r\nwhich he closed his eyes in October, 1786, presented features of\r\ndemoralization unsurpassed in any previous era. In fact, during the\r\nperiod of forty-one years between the accession of the ninth shogun,\r\nIeshige, in 1745, and the death of the tenth, Ieharu, in 1786, the\r\nmanners and customs of the citizens developed along very evil lines.\r\nIt was in this time that the city Phryne (machi-geisha) made her\r\nappearance; it was in this time that the theatre, which had hitherto\r\nbeen closed to the better classes, began to be frequented by them; it\r\nwas in this time that gambling became universal; it was in this time\r\nthat parents learned to think it an honour to see their daughters\r\nwinning favour as dancing girls, and it was in this time that the\r\nsamurai's noble contempt for money gave place to the omnipotence of\r\ngold in military and civil circles alike.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL COURT. THE 113TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR HIGASHIYAMA\r\n(A.D. 1687-1710)\r\n\r\nIn 1687, the Emperor Reigen abdicated in favour of Higashiyama, then\r\na boy of thirteen, Reigen continuing to administer affairs from\r\nbehind the curtain as was usual. Tsunayoshi was then the shogun in\r\nYedo. He showed great consideration for the interests of the Imperial\r\nCourt. Thus, he increased his Majesty's allowance by ten thousand\r\nkoku of rice annually, and he granted an income of three thousand\r\nkoku to the ex-Emperor. Moreover, all the Court ceremonies, which had\r\nbeen interrupted for want of funds, were resumed, and steps were\r\ntaken to repair or rebuild the sepulchres of the sovereigns\r\nthroughout the empire.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN THE FEUDATORIES AND THE COURT NOBLES\r\n\r\nAccording to a rule made in the beginning of the Tokugawa dynasty, a\r\nlady of Tokugawa lineage was forbidden to marry a Court noble, but\r\nthe shogun himself was expected to take a consort from one of the\r\nnoble houses in the Imperial capital. From the days of Iemitsu this\r\nlatter custom was steadily maintained, and gradually the feudatories\r\ncame to follow the shogun's example, so that marriages between\r\nmilitary magnates and noble ladies of Kyoto Were frequent. To these\r\nunions the Court nobles were impelled by financial reasons and the\r\nmilitary men by ambition. The result was the gradual formation of an\r\nImperial party and of a Bakufu party in Kyoto, and at times there\r\nensued sharp rivalry between the two cliques. In the days of the\r\nseventh shogun, Ietsugu, the Emperor Reigen would have given his\r\ndaughter Yaso to be the shogun's consort for the purpose of restoring\r\nreal friendship between the two Courts, but the death of the shogun\r\nin his boyhood interrupted the project.\r\n\r\nTHE 114TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR NAKANOMIKADO (A.D. 1710-1735)\r\n\r\nHigashiyama abdicated (1710) in favour of Nakanomikado, who reigned\r\nfor twenty-five years. This reign is remarkable for a change in the\r\nsystem hitherto uniformly pursued, namely, that all Imperial princes\r\nwith the exception of the direct heir should become Buddhist priests\r\n(ho-shinnd), and all princesses except those chosen as consorts of\r\nthe shoguns, should become Buddhist nuns (bikuni-gosho). It has\r\nalready been shown that this custom found many followers in the days\r\nof Ashikaga administration, and it was observed with almost equal\r\nstrictness under the Tokugawa, who certainly aimed at the gradual\r\nweakening of the Imperial household's influence. Arai Hakuseki\r\nremonstrated with the shogun, Ienobu, on the subject. He contended\r\nthat however humble a man's lot may be, his natural desire is to see\r\nhis children prosper, whereas in the case of Imperial princes, they\r\nwere condemned to the ascetic career of Buddhist priests. He\r\ndenounced such a system as opposed to the instincts of humanity, and\r\nhe advised not only that certain princes should be allowed to form\r\nfamilies of their own, but also that Imperial princesses should marry\r\ninto branches of the Tokugawa. Ienobu is said to have acknowledged\r\nthe wisdom of this advice, and its immediate result was the\r\nestablishment of the princely house of Kanin, which, with the houses\r\nof Fushimi, Kyogoku (afterwards Katsura), and Arisugawa, became the\r\nfour Shinnoke. Among other privileges these were designated to\r\nfurnish an heir to the throne in the event of the failure of direct\r\nissue. When Yoshimune succeeded to the headship of the Bakufu, and\r\nafter Arai Hakuseki was no longer in office, this far-seeing policy\r\nwas gradually abandoned, and all the relations between the Imperial\r\nCourt and the Bakufu became somewhat strained.\r\n\r\nTHE 115TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR SAKURAMACHI (A. D, 1732-1735), AND\r\nTHE 116TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR MOMOZONO (A.D. 1735-1762)\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the ex-Emperor Reigen (1732), the Emperor\r\nNakanomikado administered affairs himself during three years, and\r\nthen abdicated in 1735 in favour of Sakuramachi, who was sixteen\r\nyears of age, and who reigned until 1747, when he abdicated in favour\r\nof Momozono, then seven years of age. It was in this reign that there\r\nappeared an eminent scholar, Yamazaki Ansai, who, with his scarcely\r\nless famous pupil, Takenouchi Shikibu, expounded the Chinese classics\r\naccording to the interpretation of Chutsz. They sought to combine the\r\ncults of Confucianism and Shinto, and to demonstrate that the Mikados\r\nwere descendants of gods; that everything possessed by a subject\r\nbelonged primarily to the sovereign, and that anyone opposing his\r\nMajesty's will must be killed, though his brothers or his parents\r\nwere his slayers. The obvious effect of such doctrines was to\r\ndiscredit the Bakufu shoguns, and information having ultimately been\r\nlodged in Yedo through an enemy of Takenouchi, seventeen Court nobles\r\ntogether with others were arrested and punished, some capitally and\r\nsome by exile. Among those executed the most remarkable was Yamagata\r\nDaini, a master of military science, who, having endured the torture\r\nwithout confession, was finally put to death on the ground that in\r\nteaching the method of attacking a fortress he used drawings of Yedo\r\nCastle. This incident is remarkable as indicating the first potent\r\nappearance of a doctrine to the prevalence of which the fall of the\r\nTokugawa Bakufu was ultimately referable.\r\n\r\nTHE 117TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPRESS GO-SAKURAMACHI (A.D. 1762-1770), AND\r\nTHE 118TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR GO-MOMOZONO (A.D. 1770-1780)\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Momozono died in 1762 after having administered the\r\nGovernment for sixteen years. His eldest son, Prince Hidehito, being\r\na mere baby, it was decided that Princess Tomo, Momozono's elder\r\nsister, should occupy the throne, Prince Hidehito becoming the Crown\r\nPrince. Her Majesty is known in history as Go-Sakuramachi. Her reign\r\nlasted only eight years, and in 1770 she abdicated in favour of her\r\nnephew, Hidehito, who ascended the throne as the Emperor Go-Momozono\r\nand died after a reign of nine years. This exhausted the lineal\r\ndescendants of the Emperor Nakanomikado.\r\n\r\nTHE 119TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KOKAKU (A.D. 1780-1816)\r\n\r\nIn default of a direct heir it became necessary to have recourse to\r\none of the \"Four Princely Families,\" and the choice fell upon Prince\r\nTomohito, representing the Kanin house. He succeeded as Kokaku, and a\r\nJapanese historian remarks with regard to the event and to the growth\r\nof the spirit fostered by Yamazaki Ansai, Takenouchi Shikibu, and\r\nYamagata Daini, that \"the first string of the Meiji Restoration lyre\r\nvibrated at this time in Japan.\" Kokaku's reign will be referred to\r\nagain later on.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: (Keyari) SPEAR CARRIER (One of a Daimyo's Procession)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: PICKING TEA LEAVES IN UJI, A CELEBRATED TEA DISTRICT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE LATE PERIOD OF THE TOKUGAWA BAKUFU.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEVENTH SHOGUN, IENARI. (1786-1838)\r\n\r\nNATURAL CALAMITIES\r\n\r\nTHE misgovernment of Tanuma and his son was not the only calamity\r\nthat befell the country during the closing years of the tenth shogun,\r\nIeharu's, administration. The land was also visited by famine and\r\npestilence of unparallelled dimensions. The evil period began in 1783\r\nand lasted almost without intermission for four years. It is recorded\r\nthat when the famine was at its height, rice could not be obtained in\r\nsome parts of the country for less than forty ryo a koku. Sanguinary\r\nriots took place in Yedo, Kyoto, Osaka, and elsewhere. The stores of\r\nrice-merchants and the residences of wealthy folks were plundered\r\nand, in many cases, destroyed. To such extremities were people driven\r\nthat cakes made from pine-tree bark served as almost the sole means\r\nof subsistence in some districts, and the Government is found gravely\r\nproclaiming that cakes made of straw were more nutritious. There are\r\nrecords of men deserting their families, wandering into other\r\nprovinces in search of food and dying by thousands on the way. An\r\nofficial who had been sent to Matsumae, in the province of Mutsu, to\r\nobserve the state of affairs, reported that the villages to the east\r\nof Nambu had been practically depopulated and the once fertile fields\r\nconverted into barren plains. \"Although farmhouses stood in the\r\nhamlets, not a solitary person was to be seen on the road; not a\r\nhuman voice was to be heard. Looking through a window, one saw dead\r\nbodies lying without anyone to bury them, and sometimes skeletons\r\ncovered with quilts reposed on the mats, while among the weeds\r\ncountless corpses were scattered.\"\r\n\r\nTHE ELEVENTH SHOGUN, IENARI\r\n\r\nAmong these terrible conditions the tenth shogun, Ieharu died, in\r\n1786, and was succeeded by Ienari, a son of Hitotsubashi Harunari and\r\na great-grandson of Yoshimune. Ienari was in his fifteenth year, and,\r\nof course, at such a tender age he could not possibly deal with the\r\nfinancial, economic, and administrative problems that presented\r\nthemselves at this, the darkest period of Tokugawa sway. Fortunately\r\na man of genius was found to grapple with the situation. Matsudaira\r\nSadanobu, son of Tayasu Munetake and grandson of Yoshimune, proved\r\nhimself one of the most capable administrators Japan had hitherto\r\nproduced. In 1788, he was appointed prime minister, assisted by a\r\ncouncil of State comprising the heads of the three Tokugawa families\r\nof Mito, Kii, and Owari. Sadanobu was in his thirtieth year, a man of\r\nboundless energy, great insight, and unflinching courage. His first\r\nstep was to exorcise the spectre of famine by which the nation was\r\nobsessed. For that purpose he issued rules with regard to the storing\r\nof grain, and as fairly good harvests were reaped during the next few\r\nyears, confidence was in a measure restored. The men who served the\r\nBakufu during its middle period in the capacity of ministers had been\r\ntaken almost entirely from the families of Ii, Sakai, and Hotta, but\r\nnone of them had shown any marked ability; they had allowed their\r\nfunctions to be usurped by the personal attendants of the shogun.\r\nThis abuse was remedied by the appointment of the heads of the three\r\nTokugawa families to the post of ministers, and for a time Sadanobu\r\nreceived loyal and efficient support from his colleagues.\r\n\r\nCONFLAGRATION IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nThe series of calamities which commenced with the tempests, floods,\r\nand famines of 1788 culminated in a fire such as never previously had\r\nswept Kyoto. It reduced to ashes the Imperial palace, Nijo Castle,\r\n220 Shinto shrines, 128 Buddhist temples, and 183,000 houses. The\r\nloss of life (2600) was not by any means as severe as that in the\r\ngreat fire of Yedo, but the Imperial city was practically destroyed.\r\nIshikawa Jinshiro, who commanded at Nijo Castle, immediately\r\ndistributed a thousand koku of rice from the Government's store to\r\nrelieve the distressed citizens. He acted in this matter without\r\nwaiting to seek sanction from the Bakufu, and his discretion was\r\nrewarded by appointment to the high office of inspector-general of\r\npolice (o-metsuke).\r\n\r\nThe problem of restoring the palace presented much difficulty in the\r\nimpoverished state of the country, but the Bakufu did not hesitate to\r\ntake the task in hand, and to issue the necessary requisitions to the\r\nfeudatories of the home provinces. Sadanobu himself repaired to Kyoto\r\nto superintend the work, and took the opportunity to travel\r\nthroughout a large part of the country. During his tour all that had\r\nany grievances were invited to present petitions, and munificent\r\nrewards were bestowed on persons who had distinguished themselves by\r\nacts of filial piety or by lives of chastity. Such administrative\r\nmeasures presented a vivid contrast with the corrupt oppression\r\npractised by the Tanuma family, and it is recorded that men and women\r\nkneeled on the road as Sadanobu passed and blessed him with tears.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SANNO FESTIVAL OF TOKYO IN EARLY DAYS\r\n\r\nSUMPTUARY REGULATIONS\r\n\r\nConvinced that the most important step towards economic improvement\r\nwas the practice of frugality, Sadanobu caused rules to be compiled\r\nand issued which dealt with almost every form of expenditure. He\r\nhimself made a practice of attending at the castle wearing garments\r\nof the coarsest possible materials, and the minute character of his\r\nordinances against extravagance almost taxes credulity.\r\n\r\nThus, he forbade the custom of exchanging presents between official\r\ncolleagues; ordered that everyone possessing an income of less than\r\nten thousand koku should refrain from purchasing anything new,\r\nwhether clothing, utensils, or furniture; interdicted the wearing of\r\nwhite robes except on occasions of ceremony; ordained that wedding\r\npresents should henceforth be reduced by one-half, advised that dried\r\nlobsters should be substituted for fresh fish in making presents;\r\nprohibited the wearing of brocade or embroidered silk by ladies not\r\nof the highest class; enjoined simplicity in costumes for the no\r\ndance, in children's toys, in women's pipes, or tobacco-pouches, and\r\nin ladies' hairpins or hairdress; forbade gold lacquer in any form\r\nexcept to delineate family crests; limited the size of dolls; vetoed\r\nbanquets, musical entertainments, and all idle pleasures except such\r\nas were justified by social status, and actually went to the length\r\nof ordering women to dress their own hair, dispensing entirely with\r\nprofessional Hairdressers, who were bade to change their occupation\r\nfor tailoring or laundry work.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable statesman laboured for the ethical improvement of his\r\ncountrymen as well as for their frugality of life. In 1789, we find\r\nhim legislating against the multiplication of brothels, and, two\r\nyears later, he vetoed mixed bathing of men and women. One of the\r\nfashions of the time was that vassals left in charge of their lords'\r\nmansions in Yedo used to organize mutual entertainments by way of\r\npromoting good-fellowship, but in reality for purposes of\r\ndissipation. These gatherings were strictly interdicted.\r\nSimultaneously with the issue of this mass of negative legislation,\r\nSadanobu took care to bestow rewards and publish eulogies. Whoever\r\ndistinguished himself by diligent service, by chastity, by filial\r\npiety, or by loyalty, could count on honourable notice.\r\n\r\nTHE KWANSEI VAGABONDS\r\n\r\nDuring the Kwansei era (1789-1800), Yedo was infested by vagabonds,\r\nwho, having been deprived of their livelihood by the famine during\r\nthe years immediately previous, made a habit of going about the town\r\nin groups of from three to five men committing deeds of theft or\r\nincendiarism. Sadanobu, acting on the advice of the judicial\r\nofficials, dealt with this evil by establishing a house of correction\r\non Ishikawa Island. There homeless vagrants were detained and\r\nprovided with work, those ignorant of any handicraft being employed\r\nas labourers. The inmates were fed and clothed by the Government, and\r\nset free after three years, their savings being handed to them to\r\nserve as capital for some occupation. The institution was placed\r\nunder the care of Hasegawa Heizo, five hundred bags of rice and five\r\nhundred ryo being granted annually by the Bakufu for its support.\r\n\r\nADOPTION\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that one of the abuses which came into large\r\npractice from the middle period of the Tokugawa Bakufu was the\r\nadoption of children of ignoble birth into samurai families in\r\nconsideration of monetary payments by their parents. This mercenary\r\ncustom was strictly interdicted by the Matsudaira regent, who justly\r\nsaw in it a danger to the solidity of the military class. But it does\r\nnot appear that his veto received full observance.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nSince the shogun Tsunayoshi (1680-1709) appointed Hayashi Nobuatsu as\r\nchief of Education in Yedo, and entrusted to him the conduct of the\r\ncollege called Seido, Hayashi's descendants succeeded to that post by\r\nhereditary right. They steadily followed the principles of\r\nConfucianism as interpreted by Chutsz, a Chinese philosopher who died\r\nin the year 1200, but in accordance with the inevitable fate of all\r\nhereditary offices, the lapse of generations brought inferiority of\r\nzeal and talent. During the first half of the seventeenth century,\r\nthere appeared in the field of Japanese philosophy Nakaye Toju, who\r\nadopted the interpretation of Confucianism given by a later Chinese\r\nphilosopher, Wang Yang-ming (1472-1529). At a subsequent date Yamaga\r\nSoko, Ito Jinsai, and Ogyu Sorai (called also Butsu Sorai) asserted\r\nthe superiority of the ancient Chinese teaching; and finally\r\nKinoshita Junan preached the rule of adopting whatever was good,\r\nwithout distinction of Tang or Sung.\r\n\r\nThese four schools engaged in vehement controversy, and showed such\r\npassion in their statements and such intolerance in their\r\ncontradictions, that they seemed to have altogether forgotten the\r\nethical principles underlying their own doctrines. In the last\r\nquarter of the eighteenth century, other schools came into being, one\r\ncalling itself the \"eclectic school,\" another the \"inductive school,\"\r\nand so forth, so that in the end one and the same passage of the\r\nConfucian Analects received some twenty different interpretations,\r\nall advanced with more or less abuse and injury to the spirit of\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the educational chief in Yedo lost control of\r\nthe situation. Even among his own students there were some who\r\nrejected the teachings of Chutsz, and Confucianism threatened to\r\nbecome a stumbling-block rather than an aid to ethics. The prime\r\nminister, Sadanobu, now appointed four philosophers of note to assist\r\nthe Hayashi family, and these famous teachers attended in turn at the\r\nSeido to lecture, commoners as well as samurai being allowed to\r\nattend. Sadanobu further directed that the heads of Government\r\ndepartments should send in a list of those best educated among their\r\nsubordinates, and the men thus recommended were promoted after\r\nexamination. Moreover, the prime minister himself, attended by his\r\ncolleagues and the administrators, made a habit of inspecting\r\npersonally, from time to time, the manner of teaching at the college,\r\nand finally, in 1795, the Seido was definitely invested with the\r\ncharacter of a Government college, a yearly grant of 1130 koku being\r\napportioned to meet the expenses, and an income of 1500 koku being\r\nbestowed upon the Hayashi family.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, it was decreed that no one should be eligible for a\r\npost in the civil service unless he was an avowed follower of the\r\nChutsz philosophy. This bigoted measure, spoken of as the\r\n\"prohibition of heterodoxy,\" did not produce the desired effect. It\r\ntended rather to accentuate the differences between the various\r\nschools, and a petition was presented to the Bakufu urging that the\r\ninvidious veto should be rescinded. The petitioners contended that\r\nalthough the schools differed from each other, their differences were\r\nnot material, since all stood on common foundations, namely, the\r\ndoctrines of Confucius and Mencius, and all agreed in inculcating the\r\nvirtues of filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, humanity,\r\nrighteousness, politeness, and general tranquillity.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHIES OF CHUTSZ AND WANG YANG-MING\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to pause here a moment in order to inquire\r\nbriefly the nature of the philosophies which occupied Japanese\r\nthought throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. We\r\nneed not go beyond the schools of Chutsz and Wang Yang-ming, for the\r\nthird, or \"ancient,\" school adopted the teachings of Confucius and\r\nMencius in their purity, rejecting all subsequent deductions from the\r\nactual words used by these sages. These two schools have been well\r\ndistinguished as follows by a modern philosopher, Dr. Inouye\r\nTetsujiro:\r\n\r\n\"(1) Chutsz maintained that it is necessary to make an extensive\r\ninvestigation of the world and its laws before determining what is\r\nthe moral law. Wang held that man's knowledge of moral law precedes\r\nall study and that a man's knowledge of himself is the very highest\r\nkind of learning. Chutsz's method may be said to be inductive;\r\nWang's, deductive.\r\n\r\n\"(2) The cosmogony of Chutsz was dualistic. All nature owed its\r\nexistence to the Ri and Ki, the determining principle and the vital\r\nforce of primordial aura that produces and modifies motion. Wang held\r\nthat these two were inseparable. His teaching was therefore monistic.\r\n\r\n\"(3) Chutsz taught that the primary principle, Ri, and the mind of\r\nman were quite separate, and that the latter was attached to the Ki.\r\nWang held that the mind of man and the principle of the universe were\r\none and the same, and argued that no study of external nature was\r\nrequired in order to find out nature's laws. To discover these, man\r\nhad only to look within his own heart. He that understands his own\r\nheart understands nature, says Wang.\r\n\r\n\"(4) Chutsz's system makes experience necessary in order to\r\nunderstand the laws of the universe, but Wang's idealism dispenses\r\nwith it altogether as a teacher.\r\n\r\n\"(5) Chutsz taught that knowledge must come first and right conduct\r\nafter. Wang contended that knowledge and conduct cannot be separated.\r\nOne is part of the other. Chutsz may be said to exalt learned\r\ntheories and principles, and Wang to extol practice.\r\n\r\n\"The moral results of the systems briefly stated were as follows:\r\nChutsz 'a teaching produced many learned men in this country, but not\r\ninfrequently these men were inferior, being narrow-minded,\r\nprejudiced, and behind the age. Wang's doctrines, on the other hand,\r\nwhile they cannot escape the charge of shallowness on all occasions,\r\nserve the moral purpose for which they were propagated better than\r\nthose of the rival school. Though in the ranks of the Japanese\r\nfollowers of Chutsz there were numbers of insignificant, bigoted\r\ntraditionalists, the same cannot be said of those who adopted Wang's\r\nviews. They were as a class fine specimens of humanity, abreast, if\r\nnot ahead, of the age in which they lived. No system of teaching has\r\nproduced anything approaching such a number of remarkable men. If a\r\ntree is to be judged by its fruit, Wang's philosophy in Japan must be\r\npronounced one of the greatest benefits that she received from the\r\nneighbouring continent, though not a little of its power in this\r\ncountry is to be traced to the personality of the man who was the\r\nfirst to make it thoroughly known to his fellow countrymen, Nakaye\r\nToju.\"*\r\n\r\n*See Professor Walter Dening's brochure on Confucian Philosophy in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nDr. Inouye adds: \"By exclusive attention to the dictates of\r\nconscience and by sheer force of will the Wang school of philosophers\r\nsucceeded in reaching a standard of attainment that served to make\r\nthem models for posterity. The integrity of heart preached by his\r\nfollowers in Japan has become a national heritage of which all\r\nJapanese are proud. In the West, ethics has become too exclusively a\r\nsubject of intellectual inquiry, a question as to which of rival\r\ntheories is the most logical. By the Japanese, practical virtue has\r\nbeen exalted to the pedestal of the highest honour.\"\r\n\r\nThe same authority, discussing the merits of the Chutsz school, says:\r\n\"To the question which has so often been asked during the past few\r\nyears, whence comes the Japanese fine ethical standard, the answer is\r\nthat it undoubtedly originated with the teaching of Chutsz as\r\nexplained, modified, and carried into practice in Japan. The moral\r\nphilosophy of the Chutsz school in Japan compared with that of the\r\nother two schools was moderate in tone, free from eccentricities, and\r\npractical in a rare degree. In the enormous importance it attached to\r\nself-culture and what is known in modern terminology as\r\nself-realization, the teaching of the Chutsz school of Japanese\r\nmoralists differed in no material respects from the doctrines of the\r\nNew Kantians in England.\"\r\n\r\nRETIREMENT OF SADANOBU\r\n\r\nAfter six years of most enlightened service, Matsudaira Sadanobu\r\nresigned office in 1793 to the surprise and consternation of all\r\ntruly patriotic Japanese. History is uncertain as to the exact cause\r\nof his retirement, but the explanation seems to be, first, that his\r\nuncompromising zeal of reform had earned him many enemies who watched\r\nconstantly for an opportunity to attack him, and found it during his\r\nabsence on a visit to inspect the coasts of the empire with a view to\r\nenforcing the veto against foreign trade; and secondly, that a\r\nquestion of prime importance having arisen between the Courts of\r\nKyoto and Yedo, Sadanobu's influence was exercised in a manner deeply\r\nresented by the sovereign as well as by the loyalists throughout the\r\nempire. This important incident will be presently referred to in\r\ndetail. Here it will suffice to state that Sadanobu did not retire in\r\ndisgrace. He was promoted to the rank of general of the Left, which\r\nhonour was supplemented by an invitation to attend at the castle on\r\nState occasions. He chose, however, to live in retirement, devoting\r\nhimself to the administration of his own domain and to literary\r\npursuits. The author of several well-known books, he is remembered by\r\nhis pen-name, Rakuo, almost as constantly as by his historical,\r\nSadanobu. He died in 1829, at the age of seventy-two.\r\n\r\nHITOTSUBASHI HARUNARI\r\n\r\nAfter Sadanobu's resignation of the post of prime minister, the\r\nshogun's father, Hitotsubashi Harunari, moved into the western\r\ncitadel of Yedo Castle, and thenceforth the great reforms which\r\nSadanobu had effected by the force of genius and unflagging\r\nassiduity, were quickly replaced by an age of retrogression, so that\r\nposterity learned to speak of the prodigality of the Bunka and Bunsei\r\neras (1804-1829), instead of the frugality of the Kwansei\r\n(1789-1800). As for the shogun, Ienari, he received from the Throne\r\nthe highest rank attainable by a subject, together with the office of\r\ndaijo-daijin. Such honour was without precedent since the time of\r\nIeyasu. Ienari had more than fifty daughters, all born of different\r\nmothers, from which fact the dimensions of his harem may be inferred.\r\n\r\nTHE 119TH SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KOKAKU (A.D. 1780-1816)\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Kokaku ascended the throne in 1780 and abdicated in 1816.\r\nHe was undoubtedly a wise sovereign and as a classical scholar he won\r\nconsiderable renown. After reigning for thirty-six years, he\r\nadministered State affairs from the Palace of Retirement during\r\ntwenty-four, and throughout that long interval of sixty years, the\r\ncountry enjoyed profound peace. The period of Sadanobu's service as\r\nprime minister of the Bakufu coincided with the middle of Kokaku's\r\nreign, and in those days of happiness and prosperity men were wont to\r\nsay that with a wise sovereign in the west a wise subject had\r\nappeared in the east. Up to that time the relations between Kyoto and\r\nYedo were excellent, but Sadanobu's resignation and the cause that\r\nled to it produced between the two Courts a breach which contributed\r\nmaterially, though indirectly, to the ultimate fall of the Tokugawa.\r\n\r\nREBUILDING OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE\r\n\r\nIt has already been noted that after the great fire of 1788, the\r\nBakufu, acting, of course, at the instance of their prime minister,\r\nordered Sadanobu to supervise the work of reconstructing the Imperial\r\npalace. Since the days of Oda and Toyotomi, the palace had been\r\nrebuilt or extensively repaired on several occasions, but always the\r\nplans had been too small for the requirements of the orthodox\r\nceremonials. Sadanobu determined to correct this fault. He called for\r\nplans and elevations upon the bases of those of the tenth century,\r\nand from the gates to the roofs he took care that everything should\r\nbe modelled on the old lines. The edifices are said to have been at\r\nonce chaste and magnificent, the internal decorations being from the\r\nbrushes of the best artists of the Tosa and Sumiyoshi Academies.\r\nSealed estimates had been required from several leading architects,\r\nand Sadanobu surprised his colleagues by awarding the work to the\r\nhighest bidder, on the ground that cheapness could not consist with\r\ntrue merit in such a case, and that any thought of cost would evince\r\na want of reverence towards the Imperial Court. The buildings were\r\nfinished in two years, and the two Emperors, the reigning and the\r\nretired, took up their residence there. His Majesty Kokaku rewarded\r\nthe shogun with an autograph letter of thanks as well as a verse of\r\npoetry composed by himself, and on Sadanobu he conferred a sword and\r\nan album of poems. The shogun Ienari is said to have been profoundly\r\ngratified by this mark of Imperial favour. He openly attributed it to\r\nSadanobu's exertions, and he presented to the latter a facsimile of\r\nthe autograph letter.\r\n\r\nTHE TITLE TROUBLE\r\n\r\nIn the very year (1791) following the Emperor's entry into the new\r\npalace, a most untoward incident occurred. Up to that time the\r\nrelations between the Courts of Kyoto and Yedo had left nothing to be\r\ndesired, but now a permanent breach of amity took place. The\r\nsovereign was the son of Prince Tsunehito, head of the Kanin family.\r\nThis prince, in spite of his high title, was required by Court\r\netiquette to sit below the ministers of State on ceremonial occasions\r\nin the palace. Such an order of precedence offended the sovereign,\r\nand his Majesty proposed that the rank of dajo tenno should be given\r\nto his father, thus placing him in the position of a retired Emperor.\r\nOf course it was within the prerogative of the Emperor to confer\r\ntitles. The normal procedure would have been to give the desired rank\r\nto Prince Tsunehito, and then to inform the Bakufu of the\r\naccomplished fact. But, in consideration of the very friendly\r\nrelations existing between the two Courts, the sovereign seems to\r\nhave been unwilling to act on his own initiative in a matter of such\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nYedo was consulted, and to the surprise of Kyoto, the Bakufu prime\r\nminister assumed an attitude hostile to the Court's desire. The\r\nexplanation of this singular act on Sadanobu's part was that a\r\nprecisely analogous problem perplexed Yedo simultaneously. When\r\nIenari was nominated shogun, his father, Hitotsubashi Harunari, fully\r\nexpected to be appointed guardian of the new potentate, and being\r\ndisappointed in that hope, he expressed his desire to receive the\r\ntitle of o-gosho (retired shogun), so that he might enter the western\r\ncitadel of Yedo Castle and thence administer affairs as had been done\r\nby ex-Emperors in Kyoto for hundreds of years, and by ex-shoguns on\r\nseveral occasions under the Tokugawa. Disappointed in this\r\naspiration, Harunari, after some hesitation, invited the attention of\r\nthe shogun to the fact that filial piety is the basis of all moral\r\nvirtues, and that, whereas the shogun's duty required him to set a\r\ngood example to the people, he subjected his own father to unbecoming\r\nhumiliation, Ienari referred the matter to the State council, but the\r\ncouncillors hesitated to establish the precedent of conferring the\r\nrank of o-gosho on the head of one of the Sankyo families--Tayasu,\r\nShimizu, and Hitotsubashi--who had never discharged the duties of\r\nshogun.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister, Sadanobu, however, had not a moment's hesitation\r\nin opposing Harunari's project. He did, indeed, order a well-known\r\nConfucian scholar to search the annals in order to find whether any\r\nprecedent existed for the proposed procedure, either in Japan or in\r\nChina, but he himself declared that if such an example were set in\r\nthe shogun's family, it might be the cause of grave inconvenience\r\namong the people. In other words, a man whose son had been adopted\r\ninto another family might claim to be regarded as the head of that\r\nfamily in the event of the death of the foster-father. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that other and stronger reasons influenced the Bakufu prime\r\nminister. Hitotsubashi Harunari was generally known as Wagamama\r\nIrikyo (the Wayward Recluse*). His most intimate friends were the\r\nshogun's father-in-law, Shimazu Ei-O, and Ikeda Isshinsai. The latter\r\ntwo were also inkyo and shared the tastes and foibles of Harunari.\r\nOne of their greatest pleasures was to startle society. Thus, when\r\nSadanobu was legislating with infinite care against prodigality of\r\nany kind, the above three old gentlemen loved to organize parties on\r\nan ostentatiously extravagant scale, and Sadanobu naturally shrank\r\nfrom seeing the title of o-gosho conferred on such a character, thus\r\ninvesting him with competence to interfere arbitrarily in the conduct\r\nof State affairs.\r\n\r\n*It has always been a common custom in Japan for the head of a family\r\nto retire nominally from active life after he attains his fiftieth\r\nyear. He is thenceforth known as inkyo (or recluse). The same is true\r\nof women.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, the Court in Kyoto preferred its application, and\r\nSadanobu at once appreciated that if the rank of dajo tenno were\r\nconferred on Prince Tsunehito, it would be impossible to withhold\r\nthat of o-gosho from Harunari. Consequently the Bakufu prime minister\r\nwrote privately to the Kyoto prime minister, Takatsukasa Sukehira,\r\npointing out the inadvisability of the proposed step. This letter,\r\nthough not actually an official communication, had the effect of\r\nshelving the matter for a time, but, in 1791, the Emperor re-opened\r\nthe question, and summoned a council in the palace to discuss it. The\r\nresult was that sixty-five officials, headed by the prime minister\r\nand the minister of the Right, supported the sovereign's views, but\r\nthe ex-premier, Takatsukasa Sukehira, and his son, the minister of\r\nthe Left, with a few others, opposed them.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of this council with an autograph covering-letter\r\nfrom the sovereign were sent to the Bakufu, in 1792, but for a long\r\ntime no answer was given. Meanwhile Prince Tsunehito, already an old\r\nman, showed signs of declining health, and the Imperial Court pressed\r\nYedo to reply. Ultimately the Bakufu officially disapproved the\r\nproject. No statement of reasons accompanied the refusal, but it was\r\nsoftened by a suggestion that an increase of revenue might be\r\nconferred on the sovereign's father. This already sufficiently\r\ncontumelious act was supplemented by a request from the Bakufu that\r\nthe Imperial Court should send to Yedo the high secretary and the\r\nchief of the Household. Unwillingly the Court complied, and after\r\nhearing the arguments advanced by these two officials, Sadanobu\r\nsentenced them to be placed in confinement for a hundred days, and\r\nfifty days, respectively, which sentence was carried out at the\r\ntemple Seisho-ji in Yedo, and the two high officials were thereafter\r\nsent back to Kyoto under police escort. Ultimately they were both\r\ndismissed from office, and all the Court dignitaries who had\r\nsupported the sovereign's wishes were cautioned not to associate\r\nthemselves again with such \"rash and unbecoming acts.\" It can\r\nscarcely be denied that Sadanobu exercised his power in an extreme\r\nand unwise manner on this occasion. A little recourse to tact might\r\nhave settled the matter with equal facility and without open\r\ndisrespect to the Throne. But the Bakufu prime minister behaved after\r\nthe manner of the deer-stalker of the Japanese proverb who does not\r\nsee the mountain, and he thus placed in the hands of the Imperialist\r\nparty a weapon which contributed materially to the overthrow of the\r\nBakufu seventy years later.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: YO-MEI-MON GATE, AT NIKKO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION, CENTRAL AND LOCAL; CURRENCY AND THE LAWS OF THE\r\nTOKUGAWA BAKAFU\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE TOKUGAWA BAKUFU\r\n\r\nTHE organization of the Tokugawa Bakufu cannot be referred to any\r\nearlier period than that of the third shogun, Iemitsu. The\r\nfoundations indeed were laid after the battle of Sekigahara, when the\r\nadministrative functions came into the hands of Ieyasu. By him a\r\nshoshidai (governor) was established in Kyoto together with municipal\r\nadministrators (machi bugyo). But it was reserved for Iemitsu to\r\ndevelop these initial creations into a competent and consistent\r\nwhole. There was, first, what may be regarded as a cabinet, though\r\nthe name of its members (roju, or seniors) does not suggest the\r\nfunctions generally discharged by ministers of State. One of the roju\r\nwas appointed to the post of dairo (great senior). He corresponded to\r\nthe prime minister in a Western Cabinet, and the other roju may be\r\ncounted as ministers. Then there were junior ministers, and after\r\nthem came administrators of accounts, inspectors, administrators of\r\nshrines and temples, and municipal administrators. The place where\r\nState business was discharged went by the name of Go-Yo-beya. There,\r\nthe senior and junior ministers assembled to transact affairs, and\r\nthe chamber being situated in the immediate vicinity of the shogun's\r\nsitting-room, he was able to keep himself au courant of important\r\nadministrative affairs. During the time of the fifth shogun, however,\r\nas already related, this useful arrangement underwent radical\r\nalteration. As for judicial business, there did not originally exist\r\nany special place for its transaction. A chamber in the official\r\nresidence was temporarily assigned for the purpose, but at a later\r\ndate a court of justice (Hyojo-sho) was established at Tatsunokuchi\r\nin Yedo. This organization, though carried within sight of completion\r\nin the days of the third shogun, required to be supplemented by the\r\neighth, and was not actually perfected until the time of the\r\neleventh.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRO\r\n\r\nThe duties of the dairo--sometimes called karo or o-doshiyori--were\r\nto preside over the roju and to handle important administrative\r\naffairs. In many respects his functions resembled those discharged by\r\nthe regent (shikken) of the Kamakura Bakufu. To the office of dairo a\r\nspecially distinguished member of the roju was appointed, and if no\r\none possessing the necessary qualifications was available, that post\r\nhad to be left vacant. Generally the Ii, the Hotta, or the Sakai\r\nfamily supplied candidates for the office.\r\n\r\nTHE ROJU\r\n\r\nThe roju or senior ministers--called also toshiyori--discharged the\r\nadministration. They resembled the kwanryo of the Muromachi\r\nGovernment. There were five of these ministers and they exercised\r\ncontrol over all matters relating to the Imperial palace, the palace\r\nof the ex-Emperor (Sendo), the Imperial princes, the princely abbots\r\n(monzeki) and all the daimyo. It was customary to choose the roju\r\nfrom among officials who had previously served as governors of Osaka\r\nor Kyoto or as soshaban, who will be presently spoken of at greater\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nTHE WAKA-DOSHIYORI\r\n\r\nThere were five junior ministers (waka-doshiyori) whose principal\r\nfunctions were to exercise jurisdiction over the hatamoto and the\r\nkenin. These latter names have already been alluded to, but for the\r\nsake of clearness it may be well to explain that whereas the fudai\r\ndaimyo consisted of the one hundred and seventy-six barons who joined\r\nthe standard of Ieyasu before the battle of Sekigahara, the hatamoto\r\n(bannerets), while equally direct vassals of the shogun, were lower\r\nthan the daimyo though higher than the go-kenin, who comprised the\r\nbulk of the Tokugawa samurai. Members of the waka-doshiyori might at\r\nany time be promoted to the post of roju. Their functions were wide\r\nas well as numerous, and resembled those performed by the Hyojo-shu\r\nand the hikitsuke-shu of the Kamakura and Muromachi Governments. A\r\njunior minister must previously have occupied the post of\r\nadministrator of temples and shrines (jisha-bugyo) or that of\r\nchamberlain (o-soba-shu) or that of chief guard (o-ban). The offices\r\nof minister and junior minister were necessarily filled by daimyo who\r\nwere hereditary vassals of the shogun.\r\n\r\nSECRETARIES\r\n\r\nThere were two secretariats, the oku-yuhitsu (domestic secretariat)\r\nand the omote-yuhitsu (external secretariat). They discharged, on\r\naccount of the senior ministers, the duties of scribes, and were\r\npresided over by a todori, who, in later days, wielded large\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nTHE JISHA-BUGYO\r\n\r\nThe jisha-bugyo, as their name suggests, supervised all affairs\r\nrelating to shrines, temples, Shinto officials, bonzes, and nuns as\r\nwell as persons residing within the domains of shrines and temples.\r\nThey also discharged judicial functions in the case of these various\r\nclasses. The number of these administrators of shrines and temples\r\nwas originally three, but afterwards it was increased to four, who\r\ntransacted business for a month at a time in succession. The\r\nsoshaban, who were entitled to make direct reports to the shogun, had\r\nto fill the office of jisha-bugyo in addition to their other\r\nfunctions, which were connected with the management of matters\r\nrelating to ceremony and etiquette.\r\n\r\nAt first there were only two of these soshaban, but subsequently\r\ntheir number was increased to twenty-four, and it became customary\r\nfor one of them to keep watch in the castle at night. They were\r\ngenerally ex-governors of Osaka and Fushimi, and they were\r\nnecessarily daimyo who had the qualification of direct vassalage to\r\nthe shogun. The jisha-bugyo performed their judicial functions in\r\ntheir own residences, each administrator employing his own vassals\r\nfor subordinate purposes, and these vassals, when so employed, were\r\ndistinguished as jisha-yaku or toritsugi. Further, officiating\r\nin conjunction with the jisha-bugyo f were chief inspectors\r\n(daikenshi), and assistant inspectors (shokenshi) whose duties\r\nrequire no description. The classes of people to whom the\r\njisha-bugyo's jurisdiction extended were numerous: they embraced the\r\ncemetery-keepers at Momiji-yama, the bonzes, the fire-watchmen, the\r\nmusicians, the Shinto officials, the poets, the players at go or\r\nchess, and so forth.\r\n\r\nTHE MACHI-BUGYO\r\n\r\nThe municipal administrator (machi-bugyo) controlled affairs relating\r\nto the citizens in general. This was among the oldest institutions of\r\nthe Tokugawa, and existed also in the Toyotomi organization. At first\r\nthere were three machi-bugyo, but when the Tokugawa moved to Yedo,\r\nthe number was decreased to one, and subsequently increased again to\r\ntwo in the days of Iemitsu. Judicial business occupied the major part\r\nof the machi-bugyo's time. His law-court was in his own residence,\r\nand under his direction constables (yoriki or doshiri) patrolled the\r\ncity. He also transacted business relating to prisons and the\r\nmunicipal elders of Yedo (machi-doshiyori) referred to him all\r\nquestions of a difficult or serious nature.\r\n\r\nTHE KANJO-BUGYO\r\n\r\nThe financial administrator (kanjo-bugyo) received also the\r\nappellation of kitchen administrator (daidokoro-bugyo), and his\r\nduties embraced everything relating to the finance of the Bakufu,\r\nincluding, of course, their estates and the persons residing on those\r\nestates. The eight provinces of the Kwanto were under the direct\r\ncontrol of this bugyo, but other districts were administered by a\r\ndaikwan (deputy). There were two kinds of kanjo-bugyo, namely, the\r\nkuji-kata and the katte-kata (public and private), the latter of whom\r\nhad to adjudicate all financial questions directly affecting the\r\nBakufu, and the former had to perform a similar function in cases\r\nwhere outsiders were concerned. Various officials served as\r\nsubordinates of these important bugyo, who were usually taken from\r\nthe roju or the waka-doshiyori, and, in the days of the sixth shogun,\r\nit was found necessary to appoint an auditor of accounts\r\n(kanjo-gimmiyaku), who, although nominally of the same rank as the\r\nkanjo-bugyo, really acted in a supervisory capacity. The Bakufu court\r\nof law was the Hyojo-sho. Suits involving issues that lay entirely\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of one bugyo were tried by him in his own\r\nresidence, but where wider interests were concerned the three bugyo\r\nhad to conduct the case at the Hyojo-sho, where they formed a\r\ncollegiate court. On such occasions the presence of the censors was\r\ncompulsory. Sometimes, also, the three bugyo met at the Hyojo-sho\r\nmerely for purposes of consultation.\r\n\r\nTHE CENSORS\r\n\r\nAn important figure in the Tokugawa organization was the censor\r\n(metsuke), especially the great censor (o-metsuke). The holder of the\r\nlatter office served as the eyes and ears of the roju and supervised\r\nthe feudal barons. There were four or five great censors. One of them\r\nheld the additional office of administrator of roads (dochu-bugyo),\r\nand had to oversee matters relating to the villages, the towns, and\r\nthe postal stations along the five principal highways. Another had to\r\ninspect matters relating to religious sects and firearms--a strange\r\ncombination. Under the great censors were placed administrators of\r\nconfiscated estates. The ordinary censors had to exercise\r\nsurveillance over the samurai of the hatamoto and were under the\r\njurisdiction of the waka-doshiyori. There were altogether sixty\r\nmetsuke, and they travelled constantly throughout the empire\r\nobtaining materials for reports which were submitted to the\r\nwaka-doshiyori. Among them are found censors who performed the duties\r\nof coroners.*\r\n\r\n*The employment of censors by the Bakufu has been severely criticized\r\nas indicating a system of espionage. It scarcely seems necessary to\r\nobserve that the same criticism applies to all highly organized\r\nOccidental Governments with their secret services, their detectives\r\nand their inquiry agencies.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMBERLAINS\r\n\r\nEven more important than the censors were the chamberlains (soba\r\nyonin) who had to communicate to the shogun all reports submitted by\r\nthe roju, and to offer advice as to the manner of dealing with them.\r\nThey also noted the shogun's decisions and appended them to\r\ndocuments. The exercise of these functions afforded opportunities for\r\ninterfering in administrative affairs, and such opportunities were\r\nfully utilized, to the great detriment of public interest. There were\r\nalso pages (kosho); castle accountants (nando); literati to the\r\nshogun (oku-jusha), and physicians (oku-isha).\r\n\r\nMASTERS OF CEREMONIES\r\n\r\nThe duty of transmitting messages from the shogun to the Emperor and\r\nof regulating all matters of ceremony connected with the castle was\r\ndischarged by fifteen masters of ceremonies (koke) presided over by\r\nfour chiefs (the office of chief being hereditary in such families as\r\nthe Osawa and the Kira) who, although their fiefs were comparatively\r\nsmall, possessed influence not inferior to that of the daimyo. A koke\r\nwas usually on watch in the castle by day. These masters of\r\nceremonies are not to be confounded with the chamberlains (soshaban)\r\nalready spoken of. The latter numbered twenty-four. They regulated\r\naffairs connected with ceremonies in which all Government officials\r\nwere concerned, and they kept watch at the castle by night.\r\nSubordinate to the koke and the chamberlains were various officials\r\nwho conveyed presents from the feudal lords to the shogun; directed\r\nmatters of decoration and furniture; had charge of miscellaneous\r\nworks in the castle, and supervised all persons, male or female,\r\nentering or leaving the shogun's harem. Officials of this last class\r\nwere under the command of a functionary called o-rusui who had\r\ngeneral charge of the business of the harem; directed the issue of\r\npassports to men and women of the samurai class or to commoners, and\r\nhad the care of all military stores in the castle. The name rusui\r\nsignifies a person in charge during the absence of his master, and\r\nwas applied in this case since the o-rusui had to guard the castle\r\nwhen the shogun was not present. The multifarious duties entrusted to\r\nofficials over whom the o-rusui presided required a large number and\r\na great variety of persons to discharge them, but these need not be\r\nenumerated in detail here.\r\n\r\nTHE TAMARIZUME\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the elaborate etiquette observed at the shogun's\r\ncastle was the existence of semi-officials called tamarizume, whose\r\nchief duty in ordinary times was to repair to the castle once every\r\nfive days, and to inquire through the roju as to the state of the\r\nshogun's health. On occasions of emergency they participated in the\r\nadministration, taking precedence of the roju and the other\r\nfeudatories. The Matsudaira of Aizu, Takamatsu, and Matsuyama; the Ii\r\nof Hikone, and the Sakai of Himeji--these were the families which\r\nperformed the functions of tamarizume as a hereditary right. It is\r\nunnecessary to describe the organization and duties of the military\r\nguards to whom the safety of the castle was entrusted, but the fact\r\nhas to be noted that both men and officers were invariably taken from\r\nthe hatamoto class.\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS\r\n\r\nIn the o-oku, or innermost buildings of the shogun's castle,\r\nthe harem was situated. Its chief official was a woman called\r\nthe o-toshiyori (great elder), under whom were a number of\r\nladies-in-waiting, namely, the toshiyori, the rojo, the churo, the\r\nkojoro, and others. There were also ladies who attended solely to\r\nvisitors; others who kept the keys; others who carried messages to\r\npublic officers, and others who acted as secretaries. All this part\r\nof the organization would take pages to describe in detail,* and is\r\nnecessarily abbreviated here. We may add, however, that there were\r\nofficial falconers, sailors, grooms, gardeners, and every kind of\r\nartist or mechanician.\r\n\r\n*For fuller particulars of the manner of daily life at the shogun's\r\ncourt, see Chapter 1. Vol. IV, of Brinkley's \"Oriental Series.\"\r\n\r\nTHE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIn organizing a system of local government the Tokugawa Bakufu began\r\nby appointing a shoshidai in Kyoto to guard the Imperial palace, to\r\nsupervise Court officials, and to oversee financial measures as well\r\nas to hear suits-at-law, and to have control over temples and\r\nshrines. The shoshidai enjoyed a high measure of respect. He had to\r\nvisit Yedo once in every five or six years for the purpose of making\r\na report to the shogun in person. The municipal administrator of\r\nKyoto and the administrators of Nara and Fushimi, the Kyoto deputy\r\n(daikwan), and all the officials of the Nijo palace were under the\r\njurisdiction of the shoshidai. To qualify for this high office a man\r\nmust have served as governor of Osaka. In the Imperial city the\r\nmunicipal administrator heard suits-at-law presented by citizens,\r\nmanaged the affairs of temples and shrines, and was responsible for\r\ncollecting the taxes in the home provinces. There were two of these\r\nofficials in Kyoto and, like their namesakes in Yedo, they had a\r\nforce of constables (yoriki) and policemen (doshin) under their\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nTHE JODAI\r\n\r\nRegarded with scarcely less importance than that attaching to the\r\nshoshidai was an official called the jodai of Osaka, on whom devolved\r\nthe responsibility of guarding the Kwansei. For this office a\r\nhereditary daimyo of the Tokugawa family was selected, and he must\r\npreviously have occupied the offices of soshaban and jisha-bugyo. The\r\nroutine of promotion was from the jodai of Osaka to the shoshidai of\r\nKyoto and from thence to the roju. Originally there were six jodai\r\nbut their number was ultimately reduced to one. Sumpu also had a\r\njodai, who discharged duties similar to those devolving on his Osaka\r\nnamesake. In Nagasaki, Sado, Hakodate, Niigata, and other important\r\nlocalities, bugyo were stationed, and in districts under the direct\r\ncontrol of the Bakufu the chief official was the daikwan.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION IN FIEFS\r\n\r\nThe governmental system in the fiefs closely resembled the system of\r\nthe Bakufu. The daimyo exercised almost unlimited power, and the\r\nbusiness of their fiefs was transacted by factors (karo). Twenty-one\r\nprovinces consisted entirely of fiefs, and in the remaining provinces\r\npublic and private estates were intermixed.\r\n\r\nLOCAL AUTONOMY\r\n\r\nBoth the Bakufu and the feudatories were careful to allow a maximum\r\nof autonomy to the lower classes. Thus the farmers elected a village\r\nchief--called nanushi or shoya--who held his post for life or for one\r\nyear, and who exercised powers scarcely inferior to those of a\r\ngovernor. There were also heads of guilds (kumi-gashira) and\r\nrepresentatives of farmers (hyakushodai) who participated in\r\nadministering the affairs of a village. Cities and towns had\r\nmunicipal elders (machi-doshiyori), under whom also nanushi\r\nofficiated. The guilds constituted a most important feature of this\r\nlocal autonomic system. They consisted of five householders each,\r\nbeing therefore called gonin-gumi, and their main functions were to\r\nrender mutual aid in all times of distress, and to see that there\r\nwere no evasions of the taxes or violations of the law. In fact, the\r\nBakufu interfered as little as possible in the administrative systems\r\nof the agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial classes, and the\r\nfeudatories followed the same rule.\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nThe subject of finance in the Bakufu days is exceedingly complicated,\r\nand a very bare outline will suffice. It has already been noted that\r\nthe unit of land-measurement varied from time to time and was never\r\nuniform throughout the empire. That topic need not be further\r\ndiscussed. Rice-fields were divided into five classes, in accordance\r\nwith which division the rates of taxation were fixed. Further, in\r\ndetermining the amount of the land-tax, two methods were followed;\r\none by inspection, the other by average. In the case of the former,\r\nthe daikwan repaired in the fall of each year to the locality\r\nconcerned, and having ascertained the nature of the crop harvested,\r\nproceeded to determine the rate of tax. This arrangement lent itself\r\nso readily to abuse that the system of averages was substituted as\r\nfar as possible. That is to say, the average yield of crops for the\r\npreceding ten or twenty years served as a standard.\r\n\r\nThe miscellaneous taxes were numerous. Thus, there were taxes on\r\nbusiness; taxes for post-horses and post-carriers; taxes in the form\r\nof labour, which were generally fixed at the rate of fifty men per\r\nhundred koku, the object in view being work on river banks, roads,\r\nand other public institutions; taxes to meet the cost of collecting\r\ntaxes, and taxes to cover defalcations. Sometimes the above taxes\r\nwere levied in kind or in actual labour, and sometimes they were\r\ncollected in money. To facilitate collection in cities, merchants\r\nwere required to form guilds according to their respective\r\nbusinesses, and the head of each guild had to collect the tax payable\r\nby the members. Thus, upon a guild of sake-brewers a tax of a\r\nthousand gold ryo was imposed, and a guild of wholesale dealers in\r\ncotton had to pay five hundred ryo. There was a house-tax which was\r\nassessed by measuring the area of the land on which a building stood,\r\nand there was a tax on expert labour such as that of carpenters and\r\nmatmakers. In order to facilitate the levy of this last-named tax\r\nthe citizens were required to locate themselves according to the\r\nnature of their employment, and thus such names were found as\r\n\"Carpenter's street,\" \"Matmaker's street,\" and so forth. Originally\r\nthese imposts were defrayed by actual labour, but afterwards money\r\ncame to be substituted.\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the taxation system was the imposition of\r\nbuke-yaku, (military dues). For these the feudatories were liable,\r\nand as the amount was arbitrarily fixed by the Bakufu, though always\r\nwith due regard to the value of the fief, such dues were often very\r\nonerous. The same is true in an even more marked degree as to taxes\r\nin labour, materials, or money, which were levied upon the\r\nfeudatories for the purposes of any great work projected by the\r\nBakufu. These imposts were called aids (otetsudai).\r\n\r\nMANNER OF PAYING TAXES\r\n\r\nThe manner of paying taxes varied accordingly to localities. Thus, in\r\nthe Kwanto, payment was generally made in rice for wet fields and in\r\nmoney for uplands, at the rate of one gold ryo per two and a half\r\nkoku of rice. In the Kinai and western provinces as well as in the\r\nNankai-do, on the other hand, the total tax on wet fields and uplands\r\nwas divided into three parts, two of which were paid with rice and\r\none with money, the value of a koku of rice being fixed at\r\nforty-eight mon of silver (four-fifths of a gold ryo). As a general\r\nrule, taxes imposed on estates under the direct control of the Bakufu\r\nwere levied in rice, which was handed over to the daikwan of each\r\nprovince, and by him transported to Yedo, Kyoto, or Osaka, where it\r\nwas placed in stores under the control of store-administrators\r\n(kura-bugyo).\r\n\r\nIn the case of cash payments the money was transported to the castle\r\nof Yedo or Osaka, where it came under the care of the finance\r\nadministrator (kane-bugyo). Finally, the accounts connected with such\r\nreceipts of cash were compiled and rendered by the administrator of\r\naccounts (kane-bugyo), and were subsequently audited by officials\r\nnamed katte-kata, over which office a member of the roju or\r\nwaka-doshiyori presided. Statistics compiled in 1836 show that the\r\nrevenue annually collected from the Tokugawa estates in rice and\r\nmoney amounted to 807,068 koku and 93,961 gold ryo respectively. As\r\nfor the rate of the land-tax, it varied in different parts of the\r\nprovinces, from seventy per cent, for the landlord and thirty for the\r\ntenant to thirty for the landlord and seventy for the tenant.\r\n\r\nCURRENCY\r\n\r\nIt has been shown above that, from the time of the fifth shogun,\r\ndebasement of the coins of the realm took place frequently. Indeed it\r\nmay be said that whenever the State fell into financial difficulty,\r\ndebasement of the current coins was regarded as a legitimate device.\r\nMuch confusion was caused among the people by repeated changes in the\r\nquality of the coins. Thus, in the days of the eighth shogun, no less\r\nthan four varieties of a single silver token were in circulation.\r\nWhen the country renewed its foreign intercourse in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, there were no less than eight kinds of gold coin\r\nin circulation, nine of silver, and four of copper or iron. The\r\nlimits within which the intrinsic value of gold coins varied will be\r\nunderstood when we say that whereas the gold oban of the Keicho era\r\n(1596-1614) contained, approximately, 29.5 parts of gold to 13 of\r\nsilver and was worth about seventy-five yen. The corresponding coin\r\nof the Man-en era (1860) contained 10.33 parts of pure gold to 19.25\r\nof silver, and was worth only twenty-eight yen.\r\n\r\nPAPER CURRENCY\r\n\r\nThe earliest existing record of the use of paper currency dates from\r\n1661, when the feudal chief of Echizen obtained permission from the\r\nBakufu to employ this medium of exchange, provided that its\r\ncirculation was limited to the fief where the issue took place. These\r\npaper tokens were called hansatsu (fief notes), and one result of\r\ntheir issue was that moneys accruing from the sale of cereals and\r\nother products of a fief were preserved within that fief. The example\r\nof Echizen in this matter found several followers, but the system\r\nnever became universal.\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURE\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice in the Tokugawa days was based solely\r\non ethical principles. Laws were not promulgated for prospective\r\napplication. They were compiled whenever an occasion arose, and in\r\ntheir drafting the prime aim was always to make their provisions\r\nconsonant with the dictates of humanity. Once, indeed, during the\r\ntime of the second shogun, Hidetada, a municipal administrator,\r\nShimada Yuya, having held the office for more than twenty years, and\r\nhaving come to be regarded as conspicuously expert in rendering\r\njustice, it was proposed to the shogun that the judgments delivered\r\nby this administrator should be recorded for the guidance of future\r\njudges. Hidetada, however, objected that human affairs change so\r\nradically as to render it impossible to establish universally\r\nrecognizable precedents, and that if the judgments delivered in any\r\nparticular era were transmitted as guides for future generations, the\r\nresult would probably be slavish sacrifice of ethical principles on\r\nthe altar of stereotyped practice.\r\n\r\nIn 1631, when the third shogun, Iemitsu, ruled in Yedo, a public\r\ncourthouse (Hyojo-sho) was for the first time established. Up to that\r\ntime the shogun himself had served as a court of appeal in important\r\ncases. These were first brought before a bugyo, and subsequently, if\r\nspecially vital issues were at stake, the shogun personally sat as\r\njudge, the duty of executing his judgments being entrusted to the\r\nbugyo and other officials.\r\n\r\nThenceforth, the custom came to be this: Where comparatively minor\r\ninterests were involved and where the matter lay wholly within the\r\njurisdiction of one administrator, that official sat as judge in a\r\nchamber of his own mansion; but in graver cases and where the\r\ninterests concerned were not limited to one jurisdiction, the\r\nHyojo-sho became the judicial court, and the three administrators,\r\nthe roju, together with the censors, formed a collegiate tribunal.\r\nThere were fixed days each month for holding this collegiate court,\r\nand there were also days when the three administrators alone met at\r\none of their residences for purposes of private conference. The\r\nhearing by the shogun was the last recourse, and before submission to\r\nhim the facts had to be investigated by the chamberlains (sobashu),\r\nwho thus exercised great influence. A lawsuit instituted by a\r\nplebeian had to be submitted to the feudatory of the region, or to\r\nthe administrator, or to the deputy (daikwari), but might never be\r\nmade the subject of a direct petition to the shogun. If the feudatory\r\nor the deputy Were held to be acting contrary to the dictates of\r\nintegrity and reason, the suitor might change his domicile for the\r\npurpose of submitting a petition to the authorities in Yedo; and the\r\nlaw provided that no obstruction should be placed in the way of such\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nLAW\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the original principle of the Bakufu was to avoid\r\ncompiling any written criminal code. But from the days of the sixth\r\nand the seventh shoguns, Ienobu and Ietsugu, such provisions of\r\ncriminal law as related to ordinary offences came to be written in\r\nthe most intelligible style and placarded throughout the city of Yedo\r\nand provincial towns or villages. On such a placard (kosatsu) posted\r\nup, in the year 1711, at seven places in Yedo, it was enjoined on\r\nparents, sons, daughters, brothers, husbands, wives, and other\r\nrelatives that they must maintain intimate and friendly relations\r\namong themselves; and that, whereas servants must be faithful and\r\nindustrious, their masters should have compassion and should obey the\r\ndictates of right in dealing with them; that everyone should be hard\r\nworking and painstaking; that people should not transgress the limits\r\nof their social status; that all deceptions should be carefully\r\navoided; that everyone should make it a rule of life to avoid doing\r\ninjury or causing loss to others; that gambling should be eschewed;\r\nthat quarrels and disputes of every kind should be avoided; that\r\nasylum should not be given to wounded persons; that firearms should\r\nnot be used without cause; that no one should conceal an offender;\r\nthat the sale or purchase of human being, should be strictly\r\nprohibited except in cases where men or women offered their services\r\nfor a fixed term of years or as apprentices, or in cases of\r\nhereditary servitude; finally, that, though hereditary servants went\r\nto other places and changed their domicile, it should not be lawful\r\nto compel their return.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the eighth shogun, Yoshimune, it being held that\r\ncrimes were often due to ignorance of law, the feudatories and\r\ndeputies were directed to make arrangements for conveying to the\r\npeople tinder their jurisdiction some knowledge of the nature of the\r\nstatutes; and the result was that the mayors (nanushi) of provincial\r\ntowns and villages had to read the laws once a month at a meeting of\r\ncitizens or villagers convened for the purpose. Previously to this\r\ntime, namely, in the days of the fourth shogun, Ietsugu, the office\r\nof recorder (tome-yaku) was instituted in the Hyojo-sho for the\r\npurpose of committing to writing all judgments given in lawsuits. But\r\nin the days of Yoshimune, the rules and regulations issued by the\r\nBakufu from the time of Ieyasu downwards were found to have fallen\r\ninto such confusion that the difficulty of following them was\r\npractically insuperable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in 1742, Matsudaira Norimura, one of the roju, together\r\nwith the three administrators, was commissioned to compile a body of\r\nlaws, and the result was a fifteen volume book called the Hatto-gaki\r\n(Prohibitory Writings). The shogun himself evinced keen interest in\r\nthis undertaking. He frequently consulted with the veteran officials\r\nof his court, and during a period of several years he revised \"The\r\nRules for Judicial Procedure.\" Associated with him in this work were\r\nKada Arimaro, Ogyu Sorai, and the celebrated judge, Ooka Tadasuke,\r\nand not only the Ming laws of China, but also the ancient Japanese\r\nDaiho-ritsu were consulted.\r\n\r\nThis valuable legislation, which showed a great advance in the matter\r\nof leniency, except in the case of disloyal or unfilial conduct, was\r\nfollowed, in 1767, by reforms under the shoqun, Ieharu, when all the\r\nlaws and regulations placarded or otherwise promulgated since the\r\ndays of Ieyasu were collected and collated to form a prefatory\r\nvol-ume to the above-mentioned \"Rules for Judicial Procedure,\" the\r\ntwo being thenceforth regarded as a single enactment under the title\r\nof Kajo-ruiten. \"The Rules for Judicial Procedure\" originally\r\ncomprised 103 articles, but, in 1790, Matsudaira Sadanobu revised\r\nthis code, reducing the number of articles to one hundred, and\r\ncalling it Tokugawa Hyakkajd, or \"One Hundred Laws and Regulations of\r\nthe Tokugawa.\" This completed the legislative work of the Yedo\r\nBakufu. But it must not be supposed that these laws were disclosed to\r\nthe general public. They served simply for purposes of official\r\nreference. The Tokugawa in this respect strictly followed the\r\nConfucian maxim, \"Make the people obey but do not make them know.\":\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MATSUDAIRA SADANORU\r\n\r\nCRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS\r\n\r\nIn Tokugawa days the principal punishments were; six: namely,\r\nreprimand (shikari), confinement (oshikome), flogging (tataki),\r\nbanishment (tsuiho), exile to an island (ento), and death (shikei).\r\nThe last named was divided into five kinds, namely, deprivation of\r\nlife (shizai), exposing the head after decapitation (gokumon),\r\nburning at the stake (hiaburi), crucifixion (haritsuke), and sawing\r\nto death (nokogiri-biki). There were also subsidiary penalties, such\r\nas public exposure (sarashi), tattooing (irezumi)--which was resorted\r\nto not less for purposes of subsequent identification than as a\r\ndisgrace--confiscation of an estate (kessho), and degradation to a\r\nstatus below the hinin (hininteshita).\r\n\r\nThe above penalties were applicable to common folk. In the case of\r\nsamurai the chief punishments were detention (hissoku), confinement\r\n(heimon or chikkyo), deprivation of status (kaieki), placing in the\r\ncustody of a feudatory (azuke), suicide (seppuku), and decapitation\r\n(zanzai). Among these, seppuku was counted the most honourable. As a\r\nrule only samurai of the fifth official rank and upwards were\r\npermitted thus to expiate a crime, and the procedure was spoken of as\r\n\"granting death\" (shi wo tamau). The plebeian classes, that is to\r\nsay, the farmers, the artisans, and the tradesmen, were generally\r\npunished by fines, by confinement, or by handcuffing (tegusari).\r\nPriests were sentenced to exposure (sarashi), to expulsion from a\r\ntemple (tsui-iri), or to exile (kamai).\r\n\r\nFor women the worst punishment was to be handed over as servants\r\n(yakko) or condemned to shave their heads (teihatsu). Criminals who\r\nhad no fixed domicile and who repeated their evil acts after\r\nexpiration of a first sentence, were carried to the island of\r\nTsukuda, in Yedo Bay, or to Sado, where they were employed in various\r\nways. Blind men or beggars who offended against the law were handed\r\nover to the chiefs of their guilds, namely, the soroku in the case of\r\nthe blind, and the eta-gashira in the case of beggars.* Some of the\r\nabove punishments were subdivided, but these details are unimportant.\r\n\r\n*For fuller information about these degraded classes see Brinkley's\r\n\"Oriental Series,\" Vol. II.\r\n\r\nPRISONS\r\n\r\nIn Yedo, the buildings employed as prisons were erected at Demmacho\r\nunder the hereditary superintendence of the Ishide family. The\r\ngovernor of prisons was known as the roya-bugyo. Each prison was\r\ndivided into five parts where people were confined according to their\r\nsocial status. The part called the agari-zashiki was reserved for\r\nsamurai who had the privilege of admission to the shogun's presence;\r\nand in the part called the agariya common, samurai and Buddhist\r\npriests were incarcerated. The oro and the hyakusho-ro were reserved\r\nfor plebeians, and in the onna-ro women were confined. Each section\r\nconsisted of ten rooms and was capable of accommodating seven hundred\r\npersons. Sick prisoners were carried to the tamari, which were\r\nsituated at Asakusa and Shinagawa, and were under the superintendence\r\nof the hinin-gashira. All arrangements as to the food, clothing, and\r\nmedical treatment of prisoners were carefully thought out, but it is\r\nnot to be supposed that these Bakufu prisons presented many of the\r\nfeatures on which modern criminology insists. On the contrary, a\r\nprisoner was exposed to serious suffering from heat and cold, while\r\nthe coarseness of the fare provided for him often caused disease and\r\nsometimes death. Nevertheless, the Japanese prisons in Tokugawa days\r\nwere little, if anything, inferior to the corresponding institutions\r\nin Anglo-Saxon countries at the same period.\r\n\r\nLOYALTY AND FILIAL PIETY\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the Tokugawa legislators the cardinal virtues were\r\nloyalty and filial piety, and in the inculcation of these, even\r\njustice was relegated to an inferior place. Thus, it was provided\r\nthat if a son preferred any public charge against his father, or if a\r\nservant opened a lawsuit against his master, the guilt of the son or\r\nof the servant must be assumed at the outset as an ethical principle.\r\nTo such a length was this ethical principle carried that in\r\nregulations issued by Itakura Suo no Kami for the use of the Kyoto\r\ncitizens, we find the following provision: \"In a suit-at-law between\r\nparent and son judgment should be given for the parent without regard\r\nto the pleading of the son. Even though a parent act with extreme\r\ninjustice, it is a gross breach of filial duty that a son should\r\ninstitute a suit-at-law against a parent. There can be no greater\r\nimmorality, and penalty of death should be meted out to the son\r\nunless the parent petitions for his life.\" In an action between uncle\r\nand nephew a similar principle applied. Further, we find that in\r\nnearly every body of law promulgated throughout the whole of the\r\nTokugawa period, loyalty and filial piety are placed at the head of\r\nethical virtues; the practice of etiquette, propriety, and military\r\nand literary accomplishments standing next, while justice and\r\ndeference for tradition occupy lower places in the schedule.\r\n\r\nA kosatsu (placard) set up in 1682, has the following inscription:\r\n\"Strive to be always loyal and filial. Preserve affection between\r\nhusbands and wives, brothers, and all relatives; extend sympathy and\r\ncompassion to servants.\" Further, in a street notice posted in Yedo\r\nduring the year 1656, we find it ordained that should any disobey a\r\nparent's directions, or reject advice given by a municipal elder or\r\nby the head of a five-households guild, such a person must be brought\r\nbefore the administrator, who, in the first place, will imprison him;\r\nwhereafter, should the malefactor not amend his conduct, he shall be\r\nbanished forever; while for anyone showing malice against his father,\r\narrest and capital punishment should follow immediately.\r\n\r\nIn these various regulations very little allusion is made to the\r\nsubject of female rights. But there is one significant provision,\r\nnamely, that a divorced woman is entitled to have immediately\r\nrestored to her all her gold and silver ornaments as well as her\r\ndresses; and at the same time husbands are warned that they must not\r\nfail to make due provision for a former wife. The impression conveyed\r\nby careful perusal of all Tokugawa edicts is that their compilers\r\nobeyed, from first to last, a high code of ethical principles.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"INRO,\" LACQUERED MEDICINE CASE CARRIED CHIEFLY BY SAMURAI\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TOKUGAWA MITSUKUNI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF THE SHINTO CULT\r\n\r\nRYOBU SHINTO\r\n\r\nTHE reader is aware that early in the ninth century the celebrated\r\nBuddhist priest, Kukai (Kobo Daishi), compounded out of Buddhism and\r\nShinto a system of doctrine called Ryobu Shinto. The salient feature\r\nof this mixed creed was the theory that the Shinto deities were\r\ntransmigrations of Buddhist divinities. Thereafter, Buddhism became\r\nthe national religion, which position it held until the days of the\r\nTokugawa shoguns, when it was supplanted among educated Japanese by\r\nthe moral philosophy of Confucius, as interpreted by Chutsz, Wang\r\nYang-ming, and others.\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF PURE SHINTO\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm and the intolerance showed by the disciples of Chinese\r\nphilosophy produced a reaction in Japan, and this culminated in the\r\nrevival of Shinto, during which process the anomalous position\r\noccupied by the shogun towards the sovereign was clearly\r\ndemonstrated, and the fact contributed materially to the downfall of\r\nthe Tokugawa. It was by Ieyasu himself that national thought was\r\nturned into the new channel, though it need scarcely be said that the\r\nfounder of the Tokugawa shogunate had no premonition of any results\r\ninjurious to the sway of his own house.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Sekigahara had established his administrative\r\nsupremacy, and after he had retired from the shogunate in favour of\r\nHidetada, Ieyasu applied himself during his residence at Sumpu to\r\ncollecting old manuscripts, and shortly before his death he directed\r\nthat the Japanese section of the library thus formed should be handed\r\nover to his eighth son, the baron of Owari, and the Chinese portion\r\nto his ninth son, the baron of Kii. Another great library was\r\nsubsequently brought together by a grandson of Ieyasu, the celebrated\r\nMitsukuni (1628-1700), baron of Mito, who, from his youthful days,\r\ndevoted attention to Japanese learning, and, assembling a number of\r\neminent scholars, composed the Dai Nihon-shi (History of Great\r\nJapan), which consisted of 240 volumes and became thenceforth\r\nthe standard history of the country. It is stated that the\r\nexpenditures involved in producing this history, together with a\r\nfive-hundred-volume work on the ceremonies of the Imperial Court,\r\namounted to one-third of the Mito revenues, a sum of about 700,000\r\nryo. There can be little doubt that Mitsukuni's proximate purpose in\r\nundertaking the colossal work was to controvert a theory advanced by\r\nHayashi Razan that the Emperor of Japan was descended from the\r\nChinese prince, Tai Peh, of Wu, of the Yin dynasty.\r\n\r\nChiefly concerned in the compilation of the Dai Nihon-shi were Asaka\r\nKaku, Kuriyama Gen, and Miyake Atsuaki. They excluded the Empress\r\nJingo from the successive dynasties; they included the Emperor Kobun\r\nin the history proper, and they declared the legitimacy of the\r\nSouthern Court as against the Northern. But in the volume devoted to\r\nenumeration of the constituents of the empire, they omitted the\r\nislands of Ezo and Ryukyu. This profound study of ancient history\r\ncould not fail to expose the fact that the shogunate usurped powers\r\nwhich properly belonged to the sovereign and to the sovereign alone.\r\nBut Mitsukuni and his collaborators did not give prominence to this\r\nfeature. They confined themselves rather to historical details.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KAMO MABUCHI\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MOTOORI NOBINAGA\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for four other men to lay bare the facts of the\r\nMikado's divine right and to rehabilitate the Shinto cult. These men\r\nwere Kada Azumamaro (1668-1736), Kamo Mabuchi (1697-1769), Motoori\r\nNorinaga (1730-1801), and Hirata Atsutane (1776-1834). Associated\r\nwith them were other scholars of less note, but these are\r\novershadowed by the four great masters. Kada, indeed, did not achieve\r\nmuch more than the restoration of pure Japanese literature to the\r\npedestal upon which it deserved to stand. That in itself was no\r\ninsignificant task, for during the five centuries that separated the\r\nGen-Hei struggle from the establishment of the Tokugawa family,\r\nJapanese books had shared the destruction that overtook everything in\r\nthis period of wasting warfare, and the Japanese language itself had\r\nundergone such change that to read and understand ancient books, like\r\nthe Kojiki and the Manyo-shu, demanded a special course of study. To\r\nmake that study and to prepare the path for others was Kada's task,\r\nand he performed it so conscientiously that his successors were at\r\nonce able to obtain access to the treasures of ancient literature. It\r\nwas reserved for Mabuchi to take the lead in championing Japanese\r\nethical systems as against Chinese. By his writings we are taught the\r\nnature of the struggle waged throughout the Tokugawa period between\r\nChinese philosophy and Japanese ethics, and we are enabled, also, to\r\nreach a lucid understanding of the Shinto cult as understood by the\r\nJapanese themselves. The simplest route to that understanding is to\r\nlet the four masters speak briefly, each for himself:\r\n\r\n\"Learning is a matter in which the highest interests of the empire\r\nare involved, and no man ought to be vain enough to imagine that he\r\nis able by himself to develop it thoroughly. Nor should the student\r\nblindly adhere to the opinions of his teacher. Anyone who desires to\r\nstudy Japanese literature should first acquire a good knowledge of\r\nChinese, and then pass over to the Manyo-shu, from which he may\r\ndiscover the ancient principles of the divine age. If he resolve\r\nbravely to love and admire antiquity, there is no reason why he\r\nshould fail to acquire the ancient style in poetry as well as in\r\nother things. In ancient times, as the poet expressed only the\r\ngenuine sentiments of his heart, his style was naturally direct, but\r\nsince the practice of writing upon subjects chosen by lot came into\r\nvogue, the language of poetry has become ornate and the ideas forced.\r\nThe expression of fictitious sentiment about the relations of the\r\nsexes and miscellaneous subjects is not genuine poetry. [Kada\r\nAzumamaro.]\r\n\r\n\"Wherein lies the value of a rule of conduct? In its conducing to the\r\ngood order of the State. The Chinese for ages past have had a\r\nsuccession of different dynasties to rule over them, but Japan has\r\nbeen faithful to one uninterrupted line of sovereigns. Every Chinese\r\ndynasty was founded upon rebellion and parricide. Sometimes, a\r\npowerful ruler was able to transmit his authority to his son and\r\ngrandson, but they, in their turn, were inevitably deposed and\r\nmurdered, and the country was in a perpetual state of civil war. A\r\nphilosophy which produces such effects must be founded on a false\r\nsystem. When Confucianism was first introduced into Japan, the\r\nsimple-minded people, deceived by its plausible appearance, accepted\r\nit with eagerness and allowed it to spread its influence everywhere.\r\nThe consequence was the civil war which broke out immediately after\r\nthe death of Tenji Tenno, in A.D. 671, between that Emperor's brother\r\nand son, which only came to an end in 672 by the suicide of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\"In the eighth century, the Chinese costume and etiquette were adopted\r\nby the Court. This foreign pomp and splendour covered the rapid\r\ndepravation of men's hearts, and created a wide gulf between the\r\nMikado and his people. So long as the sovereign maintains a simple\r\nstyle of living, the subjects are contented with their own hard lot.\r\nTheir wants are few and they are easily ruled. But if a sovereign has\r\na magnificent palace, gorgeous clothing, and crowds of finely dressed\r\nwomen to wait on him, the sight of these things must cause in others\r\na desire to possess themselves of the same luxuries; and if they are\r\nnot strong enough to take them by force, their envy is excited. Had\r\nthe Mikado continued to live in a house roofed with shingles and\r\nhaving walls of mud, to carry his sword in a scabbard wound round\r\nwith the tendrils of some creeping plant, and to go to the chase\r\ncarrying his bow and arrows, as was the ancient custom, the present\r\nstate of things would never have come about. But since the\r\nintroduction of Chinese manners, the sovereign, while occupying a\r\nhighly dignified place, has been degraded to the intellectual level\r\nof a woman. The power fell into the hands of servants, and although\r\nthey never actually assumed the title, they were sovereigns in fact,\r\nwhile the Mikado became an utter nullity. . .\r\n\r\n\"In ancient times, when men's dispositions were straightforward, a\r\ncomplicated system of morals was unnecessary. It would naturally\r\nhappen that bad acts might occasionally be committed, but the\r\nintegrity of men's dispositions would prevent the evil from being\r\nconcealed and growing in extent. In these days, therefore, it was\r\nunnecessary to have a doctrine of right and wrong. But the Chinese,\r\nbeing bad at heart, were only good externally, in spite of the\r\nteaching they received, and their evil acts became of such magnitude\r\nthat society was thrown into disorder. The Japanese, being\r\nstraightforward, could do without teaching. It has been alleged that,\r\nas the Japanese had no names for 'benevolence,' 'righteousness,'\r\n'propriety,' 'sagacity,' and 'truth' they must have been without\r\nthese principles. But these things exist in every country, in the\r\nsame way as the four seasons which make their annual rounds. In the\r\nspring, the weather does not become mild all at once, or in the\r\nsummer, hot. Nature proceeds by gradual steps. According to the view\r\nof the Chinese, it is not summer or spring unless it becomes hot or\r\nmild all of a sudden. Their principles sound very plausible but are\r\nunpractical. [Kamo Mabuchi.]\r\n\r\n\"Japan is the country which gave birth to the goddess of the Sun,\r\nwhich fact proves its superiority over all other countries that also\r\nenjoy her favours. The goddess having endowed her grandson with the\r\nThree Sacred Treasures, proclaimed him sovereign of Japan for ever\r\nand ever. His descendants shall continue to rule it as long as the\r\nheavens and earth endure. Being invested with this complete\r\nauthority, all the gods under heaven and all mankind submitted to\r\nhim, with the exception of a few wretches who were quickly subdued.\r\nTo the end of time each Mikado is the son of the goddess. His mind is\r\nin perfect harmony of thought and feeling with hers. He does not seek\r\nout new inventions but rules in accordance with precedents which date\r\nfrom the Age of the Gods, and if he is ever in doubt, he has recourse\r\nto divination, which reveals to him the mind of the great goddess. In\r\nthis way the Age of the Gods and the present age are not two ages,\r\nbut one, for not only the Mikado but also his ministers and people\r\nact up to the tradition of the divine age. Hence, in ancient times,\r\nthe idea of michi, or way, (ethics) was applied to ordinary\r\nthoroughfares only, and its application to systems of philosophy,\r\ngovernment, morals, religion, and so forth is a foreign notion.\r\n\r\n\"As foreign countries (China and India, particularly the former) are\r\nnot the special domain of the Sun goddess, they have no permanent\r\nrulers, and evil spirits, finding a field of action there, have\r\ncorrupted mankind. In those countries, any bad man who could manage\r\nto seize the power became a sovereign. Those who had the upper hand\r\nwere constantly scheming to maintain their positions, while their\r\ninferiors were as constantly on the watch for opportunities to oust\r\nthem. The most powerful and cunning of these rulers succeeded in\r\ntaming their subjects, and having secured their position, became an\r\nexample for others to imitate. In China the name of 'holy men' has\r\nbeen given to these persons. But it is an error to count these 'holy\r\nmen' as in themselves supernatural and good beings, superior to the\r\nrest of the world as are the gods. The principles they established\r\nare called michi (ethics), and may be reduced to two simple rules,\r\nnamely, to take other people's territory and to keep fast hold of it.\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese 'holy men' also invented the Book of Changes, by which\r\nthey pretended to discover the workings of the universe; a vain\r\nattempt, since it is impossible for man with his limited intelligence\r\nto discover the principles which govern the acts of the gods. In\r\nimitation of them, the Chinese nation has since given itself up to\r\nphilosophizing, to which are to be attributed its constant internal\r\ndissensions. When things go right of themselves, it is best to leave\r\nthem alone. In ancient times, although there was no prosy system in\r\nJapan, there, were no popular disturbances, and the empire was\r\npeacefully ruled. It is because the Japanese were truly moral in\r\ntheir practice that they required no theory of morals, and the fuss\r\nmade by the Chinese about theoretical morals is owing to their laxity\r\nin practice. It is not wonderful that students of Chinese literature\r\nshould despise their own country for being without a system of\r\nmorals, but that the Japanese, who were acquainted with their own\r\nancient literature, should pretend that Japan too had such a system,\r\nsimply out of a feeling of envy, is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"When Chinese literature was imported into Japan, the people adopted\r\nmany Chinese ideas, laws, customs, and practices, which they so mixed\r\nup with their own that it became necessary to adopt a special name\r\nfor the ancient native customs, which were in consequence called Kami\r\nno michi or Shinto, the word 'michi' being applied in the same sense\r\nas the Chinese Tao, and Kami because of their divine origin. These\r\nnative customs survived only in ceremonies with which the native gods\r\nare worshipped. Every event in the universe is the act of the gods.\r\nThey direct the changes of the seasons, the wind and the rain, the\r\ngood and bad fortune of States and individuals. Some of the gods are\r\ngood, others bad, and their acts partake of their own natures.\r\nBuddhists attribute events to 'retribution' (Inga), while the Chinese\r\nascribe them to be the 'decree of heaven' (Tien ming). This latter is\r\na phrase invented by the so-called 'holy men' to justify murdering\r\nsovereigns and seizing their dominions. As neither heaven nor earth\r\nhas a mind, they cannot issue decrees. If heaven really could issue\r\ndecrees, it would certainly protect the good rulers and take care to\r\nprevent bad men from seizing the power, and, in general, while the\r\ngood would prosper, the bad would suffer misfortune. But in reality\r\nwe find many instances of the reverse. Whenever anything goes wrong\r\nin the world, it is to be attributed to the action of the evil gods\r\ncalled 'gods of crookedness,' whose power is so great that the Sun\r\ngoddess and the Creator-gods are sometimes unable to restrain them;\r\nmuch less are human beings able to resist their influence. The\r\nprosperity of the wicked and the misfortunes of the good, which seem\r\nopposed to ordinary justice, are their doing. The Chinese, not\r\npossessing the traditions of the Divine Age, were ignorant of this\r\ntruth, and were driven to invent the theory of heaven's decrees.\r\n\r\n\"The eternal endurance of the dynasty of the Mikado is a complete\r\nproof that the 'way,' called Kami no michi or Shinto, infinitely\r\nsurpasses the systems of all other countries. The 'holy men' of\r\nChina were merely unsuccessful rebels. The Mikado is the sovereign\r\nappointed by the pair of deities, Izanagi and Izanami, who created\r\nthis country. The Sun goddess never said, 'Disobey the Mikado if he\r\nbe bad,' and therefore, whether he be good or bad, no one attempts to\r\ndeprive him of his authority. He is the Immovable Ruler who must\r\nendure to the end of time, as long as the sun and moon continue to\r\nshine. In ancient language the Mikado was called a god, and that is\r\nhis real character. Duty, therefore, consists in obeying him\r\nimplicitly without questioning his acts. During the Middle Ages, such\r\nmen as Hojo Yoshitoki, Hojo Yasutoki, Ashikaga Takauji, and others,\r\nviolated this duty (michi) and look up arms against him. Their\r\ndisobedience to the Mikado is attributable to the influence of the\r\nChinese learning. This 'way' was established by Izanagi and Izanami\r\nand delivered by them to the Sun goddess, who handed it down, and\r\nthis is why it is called the 'way of the gods.'\r\n\r\n\"The nature of this 'way' is to be learned by studying the Kojiki and\r\nancient writings, but mankind has been turned aside from it, by the\r\nspirits of crookedness, to Buddhism and Chinese philosophy. The\r\nvarious doctrines taught under the name of Shinto are without\r\nauthority, Human beings, having been produced by the spirit of the\r\ntwo creative deities, are naturally endowed with the knowledge of\r\nwhat they ought to do, and what they ought to refrain from doing. It\r\nis unnecessary for them to trouble their heads with systems of\r\nmorality. If a system of morals were necessary, men would be inferior\r\nto animals, all of whom are endowed with the knowledge of what they\r\nought to do, only in an inferior degree to man. If what the Chinese\r\ncall benevolence, modesty, filial piety, propriety, love, fidelity,\r\nand truth really constituted the duty of man, they would be so\r\nrecognized and practised without any teaching; but since they were\r\ninvented by the so-called 'holy men' as instruments for ruling a\r\nviciously inclined population, it became necessary to insist on more\r\nthan the actual duty of man. Consequently, although plenty of men\r\nprofess these doctrines, the number of those that practise them is\r\nvery small. Violations of this teaching were attributed to human\r\nlusts. As human lusts are a part of man's nature, they must be a part\r\nof the harmony of the universe, and cannot be wrong according to the\r\nChinese theory. It was the vicious nature of the Chinese that\r\nnecessitated such strict rules, as, for instance, that persons\r\ndescended from a common ancestor, no matter how distantly related,\r\nshould not intermarry. These rules, not being founded on the harmony\r\nof the universe, were not in accordance with human feelings and were\r\ntherefore seldom obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"In ancient times, Japanese refrained from intermarriage among\r\nchildren of the same mother, but the distance between the noble and\r\nthe mean was duly preserved. Thus, the country was spontaneously well\r\ngoverned, in accordance with the 'way' established by the gods. Just\r\nas the Mikado worshipped the gods in heaven and earth, so his people\r\npray to the good gods in order to obtain blessings, and perform rites\r\nin honour of the bad gods in order to avert their displeasure. If\r\nthey committed crimes or denied themselves, they employed the usual\r\nmethods of purification taught them by their own hearts. Since there\r\nare bad as well as good gods, it is necessary to propitiate them with\r\nofferings of agreeable food, playing the lute, blowing the flute,\r\nsinging and dancing, and whatever else is likely to put them in good\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\n\"It has been asked whether the Kami no michi is not the same as the\r\nTaoism of Laotzu. Laotzu hated the vain conceits of the Chinese\r\nscholars, and honoured naturalness, from which a resemblance may be\r\nargued; but as he was born in a dirty country not under special\r\nprotection of the Sun goddess, he had heard only the theories of the\r\nsuccession of so-called 'holy men,' and what he believed to be\r\nnaturalness was simply what they called natural. He did not know that\r\nthe gods are the authors of every human action, and this ignorance\r\nconstituted a cause of radical difference. To have acquired the\r\nknowledge that there is no michi (ethics) to be learned and practised\r\nis really to have learned to practise the 'way of the gods.' . . .\r\nMany miracles occurred in the Age of the Gods, the truth of which was\r\nnot disputed until men were taught by the Chinese philosophy to\r\nanalyse the acts of the gods by the aid of their own feeble\r\nintelligence. The reason assigned for disbelieving in miracles is\r\nthat they cannot be explained; but in fact, although the Age of the\r\nGods has passed away, wondrous miracles surround us on all sides. For\r\ninstance, is the earth suspended in space or does it rest upon\r\nsomething else? If it be said that the earth rests upon something\r\nelse, then what is it that supports that something else? According to\r\none Chinese theory, the earth is a globe suspended in space with the\r\nheavens revolving round it. But even if we suppose the heavens to be\r\nfull of air, no ordinary principles will account for the land and sea\r\nbeing suspended in space without moving. The explanation offered is\r\nas miraculous as the supposition previously made. It seems plausible\r\nenough to say that the heavens are merely air and are without any\r\ndefinite form. If this be true, there is nothing but air outside the\r\nearth, and this air must be infinite or finite in extent. If it is\r\ninfinite in extent, we cannot fix any point as its centre, so that it\r\nis impossible to understand why the earth should be at rest; for if\r\nit be not in the centre it cannot be at rest. If it be finite, what\r\ncauses the air to condense in one particular spot, and what position\r\nshall we assign to it?\r\n\r\n\"In any case all these things are miraculous and strange. How absurd\r\nto take these miracles for granted, and at the same time to\r\ndisbelieve in the wonders of the Divine Age! Think again of the human\r\nbody. Seeing with the eyes, hearing With the ears, speaking with the\r\nmouth, walking on the feet, and performing all manner of acts with\r\nthe hands are strange things; so also the flight of birds and insects\r\nthrough the air, the blossoming of plants and trees, the ripening of\r\ntheir fruits and seeds are strange; and the strangest of all is the\r\ntransformation of the fox and the badger into human form. If rats,\r\nweasels, and certain birds see in the dark, why should not the gods\r\nhave been endowed with a similar faculty?.... The facts that many of\r\nthe gods are invisible now and have never been visible furnish no\r\nargument against their existence. Existence can be made known to us\r\nby other senses than those of sight, such as odour or sound, while\r\nthe wind, which is neither seen, heard, nor smelt is recognized by\r\nthe impression which it makes upon our bodies. [Motoori Norinaga].\r\n\r\n\"Although numbers of Japanese cannot state with any certainty from\r\nwhat gods they are descended, all of them have tribal names (kabane)\r\nwhich were originally bestowed by the Mikado, and those who make it\r\ntheir province to study genealogies can tell from a man's ordinary\r\nsurname who his remotest ancestor must have been. From the fact of\r\nthe divine descent of the Japanese people proceeds their immeasurable\r\nsuperiority to the natives of other countries in courage and\r\nintelligence.*\r\n\r\n*Although Hirata claims the superiority for his own countrymen, he\r\nfrankly acknowledges the achievements of the Dutch in natural\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\". . . The accounts given in other countries, whether by Buddhism or\r\nby Chinese philosophy, of the form of the heavens and earth and the\r\nmanner in which they came into existence, are all inventions of men\r\nwho exercised all their ingenuity over the problem, and inferred that\r\nsuch things must actually be the case. As for the Indian account, it\r\nis nonsense fit only to deceive women and children, and I do not\r\nthink it worthy of reflection. The Chinese theories, on the other\r\nhand, are based upon profound philosophical speculations and sound\r\nextremely plausible, but what they call the absolute and the finite,\r\nthe positive and negative essences, the eight diagrams, and the five\r\nelements, are not real existences, but are fictitious names invented\r\nby the philosophers and freely applied in every direction. They say\r\nthat the whole universe was produced by agencies, and that nothing\r\nexists which is independent of them. But all these statements are\r\nnonsense. The principles which animate the universe are beyond the\r\npower of analysis, nor can they be fathomed by human intelligence,\r\nand all statements founded upon pretended explanations of them are to\r\nbe rejected. All that man can think and know is limited by the powers\r\nof sight, feeling, and calculation, and what goes beyond these\r\npowers, cannot be known by any amount of thinking. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese accounts sound as if based upon profound principles, and\r\none fancies that they must be right, while the Japanese accounts\r\nsound shallow and utterly unfounded in reason. But the former are\r\nlies while the latter are the truth, so that as time goes on and\r\nthought attains greater accuracy, the erroneous nature of these\r\nfalsehoods becomes even more apparent whale the true tradition\r\nremains intact. In modern times, men from countries lying far off in\r\nthe West have voyaged all round the seas as their inclinations\r\nprompted them, and have ascertained the actual shape of the earth.\r\nThey have discovered that the earth is round and that the sun and the\r\nmoon revolve round it in a vertical direction, and it may thus be\r\nconjectured how full of errors are all the ancient Chinese accounts,\r\nand how impossible it is to believe anything that professes to be\r\ndetermined a priori. But when we come to compare our ancient\r\ntraditions as to the origin of a thing in the midst of space and its\r\nsubsequent development, with what has been ascertained to be the\r\nactual shape of the earth, we find that there is not the slightest\r\nerror, and this result confirms the truth of our ancient traditions.\r\nBut although accurate discoveries made by the men of the Far West as\r\nto the actual shape of the earth and its position in space infinitely\r\nsurpass the theories of the Chinese, still that is only a matter of\r\ncalculation. There are many other things actually known to exist\r\nwhich cannot be solved by that means; and still less is it possible\r\nto solve the question of how the earth, sun, and moon came to assume\r\ntheir form. Probably those countries possess theories of their own,\r\nbut whatever they may be, they can but be guesses after the event,\r\nand probably resemble the Indian and the Chinese theories.\r\n\r\n\"The most fearful crimes which a man commits go unpunished by society\r\nso long as they are undiscovered, but they draw down on him the\r\nhatred of the invisible gods. The attainment of happiness by\r\nperforming good acts is regulated by the same law. Even if the gods\r\ndo not punish secret sins by the usual penalties of law, they inflict\r\ndiseases, misfortunes, short life, and extermination of the race.\r\nNever mind the praise or blame of fellow men, but act so that you\r\nneed not be ashamed before the gods of the Unseen.

Very different was\r\nthe case in the days of the four literati quoted above. The arrogant\r\nand intolerant demeanour of Japanese students of Chinese philosophy\r\nwho elevated the Middle Kingdom on a pedestal far above the head of\r\ntheir own country, gradually provoked bitter resentment among\r\npatriotic Japanese, thus lending collateral strength to the movement\r\nwhich took place in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in\r\nfavour of reversion to the customs and canons of old times.\r\n\r\nAs soon as attention was intelligently concentrated on the history of\r\nthe past, it was clearly perceived that, in remote antiquity, the\r\nempire had always been administered from the Throne, and, further,\r\nthat the functions arrogated to themselves by the Hojo, the Oda, the\r\nToyotomi, and the Tokugawa were pure usurpations, which deprived the\r\nImperial Court of the place properly belonging to it in the State\r\npolity. Just when this reaction was developing strength, the dispute\r\nabout the title of the ex-Emperor occurred in Kyoto, and furnished an\r\nobject lesson more eloquent than any written thesis. The situation\r\nwas complicated by the question of foreign intercourse, but this will\r\nbe treated separately.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: MITSUGUMI-NO-SAKAZUKI (Sake Cups used only on Happy\r\nOccasions such as Weddings and New Year Days)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DIFFERENT STYLES OF COIFFURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS AND THE DECLINE OF THE TOKUGAWA\r\n\r\nFOREIGN TRADE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nFROM what has been stated in previous chapters, it is clearly\r\nunderstood that Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu were all well\r\ndisposed towards foreign intercourse and trade, and that the Tokugawa\r\nchief made even more earnest endeavours than Hideyoshi to\r\ndifferentiate between Christianity and commerce, so that the fate of\r\nthe former might not overtake the latter. Ieyasu, indeed, seems to\r\nhave kept three objects steadfastly in view, namely, the development\r\nof oversea trade, the acquisition of a mercantile marine, and the\r\nprosecution of mining enterprise. To the Spaniards, to the\r\nPortuguese, to the English, and to the Dutch, he offered a site for a\r\nsettlement in a suburb of Yedo, and had the offer been accepted,\r\nJapan might never have been closed to foreign intercourse. At that\r\ntime the policy of the empire was free trade. There were no customs\r\ndues, though it was expected that the foreign merchants would make\r\nliberal presents to the feudatory into whose port they carried their\r\nwares. The Tokugawa baron gave plain evidence that he regarded\r\ncommerce with the outer world as a source of wealth, and that he\r\nwished to attract it to his own domains. On more than one occasion he\r\nsent an envoy to Manila to urge the opening of trade with the regions\r\nin the vicinity of Yedo, and to ask the Spaniards for expert naval\r\narchitects. His attitude is well shown by a law enacted in 1602:\r\n\r\n\"If any foreign vessel by stress of weather is obliged to touch at\r\nany principality or to put into any harbour of Japan, we order that,\r\nwhoever these foreigners may be, absolutely nothing whatever that\r\nbelongs to them, or that they may have brought in their ship, shall\r\nbe taken from them. Likewise, we rigorously prohibit the use of any\r\nviolence in the purchase or sale of any of the commodities brought by\r\ntheir ship, and if it is not convenient for the merchants of the ship\r\nto remain in the port they have entered, they may pass to any other\r\nport that may suit them, and therein buy and sell in full freedom.\r\nLikewise, we order, in a general manner, that foreigners may freely\r\nreside in any part of Japan they choose, but we rigorously forbid\r\nthem to propagate their faith.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1605, the Tokugawa chief granted a permit to the Dutch\r\nfor trade in Japan, his expectation being that the ships which they\r\nundertook to send every year would make Uraga, or some other place\r\nnear Yedo, their port of entry. In this he was disappointed. The\r\nfirst Hollanders that set foot in Japan were eighteen survivors of\r\nthe crew of the wrecked Liefde. These men were at first placed in\r\nconfinement, and during their detention they were approached by\r\nemissaries from the feudatory of Hirado, who engaged some of them to\r\ninstruct his vassals in the art of gun casting and the science of\r\nartillery, and who also made such tempting promises with regard to\r\nHirado that the Dutch decided to choose that place for headquarters,\r\nalthough it was then, and always subsequently remained, an\r\ninsignificant little fishing village. The Dutch possessed one great\r\nadvantage over their rivals from Manila and Macao: they were prepared\r\nto carry on commerce while eschewing religious propagandism. It was\r\nthis element of the situation that the Hirado feudatory shrewdly\r\nappreciated when he enticed the Dutchmen to make Hirado their port of\r\nentry.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the desire of Ieyasu to exploit the mining resources\r\nof his country, the fact is demonstrated by an incident which\r\noccurred at the time. The governor--general of the Philippines\r\n(Rodrigo Yivero y Velasco), whose ship had been cast away on the\r\ncoast of Japan while en route for Acapulco, had an interview with\r\nIeyasu, and in response to the latter's application for fifty mining\r\nexperts, the Spaniards made a proposal, to the terms of which,\r\nonerous as they were, Ieyasu agreed; namely that one half of the\r\nproduce, of the mines should go to the miners; that the other half\r\nshould be divided equally between Ieyasu and the King of Spain; that\r\nthe latter might send officials to Japan to protect his mining\r\ninterests, and that these officials might be accompanied by priests,\r\nwho would have the right to erect public churches, and to hold\r\nreligious services there.* These things happened in 1609. Previous to\r\nthat time, the Tokugawa chief had repeatedly imposed a strict veto on\r\nChristian propagandism; yet we now find him removing that veto\r\npartially, for the sake of obtaining foreign expert assistance. Like\r\nHideyoshi, Ieyasu had full confidence in himself and in his\r\ncountrymen. He did not doubt his ability to deal with emergencies if\r\nthey arose, and he made no sacrifice to timidity. But his courageous\r\npolicy died with him, and the miners never came. Moreover, the\r\nSpaniards seemed incapable of any successful effort to establish\r\ntrade with Japan. Fitful visits were paid by their vessels at Uraga,\r\nbut the Portuguese continued to monopolize the commerce.\r\n\r\n*It is to be understood, of course, that these ministrations were\r\nintended to be limited to Spaniards resident in Japan.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: OLD SPANISH CLOCK PRESERVED IN KUNOZAN.\r\n\r\nThat commerce, however, was not without rude interruptions. One,\r\nespecially memorable, occurred at the very time when Rodrigo's vessel\r\nwas cast away. \"In a quarrel at Macao some Japanese sailors lost\r\ntheir lives, and their comrades were compelled by the commandant,\r\nPessoa, to sign a declaration exonerating the Portuguese. The\r\nsignatories, however, told a different tale when they returned to\r\nJapan, and their feudal chief, the daimyo of Arima, was much\r\nincensed, as also was Ieyasu In the following year (1609), this same\r\nPessoa arrived at Nagasaki in command of the Madre de Dios, carrying\r\ntwelve Jesuits and a cargo worth a million crowns. Ieyasu ordered the\r\nArima feudatory to seize her. Surrounded by an attacking force of\r\ntwelve hundred men in boats, Pessoa fought his ship for three days,\r\nand then, exploding her magazine, sent her to the bottom with her\r\ncrew, her passenger-priests, and her cargo.\"\r\n\r\nFifty-eight years before the date of this occurrence, Xavier had\r\nconveyed to Charles V a warning that if ships from New Spain\r\n\"attempted to conquer the Japanese by force of arms, they would have\r\nto do with a people no less covetous than warlike, who seem likely to\r\ncapture any hostile fleet, however strong.\" It was a just\r\nappreciation. The Portuguese naturally sought to obtain satisfaction\r\nfor the fate of Pessoa, but Ieyasu would not even reply to their\r\ndemands, though he made no attempt to prevent the resumption of trade\r\nwith Macao.\r\n\r\nOPENING OF ENGLISH AND DUTCH TRADE\r\n\r\nIn the year 1609, Ieyasu had reason to expect that the Spaniards and\r\nthe Dutch would both open trade with Japan. His expectation was\r\ndisappointed in the case of the Spaniards, but, two years later, the\r\nDutch flag was seen in Japanese waters. It was flown by the Brack, a\r\nmerchantman which, sailing from Patani, reached Hirado with a cargo\r\nof pepper, cloth, ivory, silk, and lead. Two envoys were on board the\r\nvessel, and her arrival in Japan nearly synchronized with the coming\r\nof the Spanish embassy from Manila, which had been despatched\r\nexpressly for the purpose of \"settling the matter regarding the\r\nHollanders.\" Nevertheless, the Dutch obtained a liberal patent from\r\nIeyasu.\r\n\r\nTwelve years previously, the merchants of London, stimulated by a\r\nspirit of rivalry with the Dutch, had organized the East India\r\nCompany, which at once began to send ships eastward. As soon as news\r\ncame that the Dutch were about to establish a trading station in\r\nJapan, the East India Company issued orders that the Clove, commanded\r\nby Saris, should proceed to the Far Eastern islands. The Clove\r\nreached Hirado on the 11th of June, 1613. Her master, Saris, soon\r\nproved that he did not possess the capacity essential to success. He\r\nwas self-opinionated, suspicious, and of shallow judgment. Though\r\nstrongly urged by Will Adams to make Uraga the seat of the new trade;\r\nthough convinced of the excellence of the harbour there, and though\r\ninstructed as to the great advantage of proximity to the shogun's\r\ncapital, he appears to have harboured some distrust of Adams, for he\r\nfinally selected Hirado in preference to Uraga, \"which was much as\r\nthough a German going to England to open trade should prefer to\r\nestablish himself at Dover or Folkestone rather than in the vicinity\r\nof London.\" Nevertheless he received from Ieyasu a charter so liberal\r\nthat it plainly displayed the mood of the Tokugawa shogun towards\r\nforeign trade:\r\n\r\n\"(1) The ship that has now come for the first time from England over\r\nthe sea to Japan may carry on trade of all kinds without hindrance.\r\nWith regard to future visits (of English ships), permission will be\r\ngiven in regard to all matters.\r\n\r\n\"(2) With regard to the cargoes of ships, requisition will be made by\r\nlist according to the requirements of the shogunate.\r\n\r\n\"(3) English ships are free to visit any port in Japan. If disabled\r\nby storms they may put into any harbour.\r\n\r\n\"(4) Ground in Yedo in the place which they may desire shall be given\r\nto the English, and they may erect houses and reside and trade there.\r\nThey shall be at liberty to return to their country whenever they\r\nwish to do so, and to dispose as they like of the houses they have\r\nerected.\r\n\r\n\"(5) If an Englishman dies in Japan of disease or any other cause,\r\nhis effects shall be handed over without fail.\r\n\r\n\"(6) Forced sales of cargo and violence shall not take place.\r\n\r\n\"(7) If one of the English should commit an offence, he should be\r\nsentenced by the English general according to the gravity of his\r\noffence.\"*\r\n\r\n*In this article, Ieyasu recognizes the principle of\r\nextra-territorial jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the above show that Saris was expected to make Yedo his\r\nheadquarters. Had he done so he would have been practically free from\r\ncompetition; would have had the eastern capital of the empire for\r\nmarket, and would have avoided many expenses and inconveniences\r\nconnected with residence elsewhere. But he did not rise to the\r\noccasion, and the result of his mistaken choice as well as of bad\r\nmanagement was that, ten years later (1623), the English factory at\r\nHirado had to be closed, the losses incurred there having aggregated\r\n£2000--$10,000. It has to be noted that, a few months after the death\r\nof Ieyasu, the above charter underwent a radical modification. The\r\noriginal document threw open to the English every port in Japan; the\r\nrevised document limited them to Hirado. But this restriction may be\r\nindirectly traced to the blunder of not accepting a settlement in\r\nYedo and a port at Uraga. For the foreign policy of the Tokugawa was\r\nlargely swayed by an apprehension that the Kyushu feudatories, many\r\nof whom were not over-well disposed to the rule of the Bakufu, might\r\nderive from the assistance of foreign trade such a fleet and such an\r\narmament as would ultimately enable them to overthrow the Tokugawa.\r\nTherefore, the precaution was adopted of confining the English and\r\nthe Dutch to Hirado, the domain of a feudatory too petty to become\r\nformidable, and to Nagasaki, which was one of the four Imperial\r\ncities, the other three being Yedo, Kyoto, and Osaka.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THE \"ATAKA MARU\" (Shogun's Barge)\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that an English factory in Yedo and English ships\r\nat Uraga would have strengthened the Tokugawa ruler's hand instead of\r\nsupplying engines of war to his political foes; and it must further\r\nbe noted that the question of locality had another injurious outcome.\r\nFor alike at Hirado and at Nagasaki, the foreign traders \"were\r\nexposed to a crippling competition at the hands of rich Osaka\r\nmonopolists, who, as representing an Imperial city and therefore\r\nbeing pledged to the Tokugawa interests, enjoyed special indulgences\r\nfrom the Bakufu. These shrewd traders who were then, as they are now,\r\nthe merchant-princes of Japan, not only drew a ring around Hirado,\r\nbut also sent vessels on their own account to Cochin China, Siam,\r\nTonkin, Cambodia, and other foreign lands with which the English and\r\nthe Dutch carried on trade.\" One can scarcely be surprised that\r\nCocks, the successor of Saris, wrote, in 1620, \"which maketh me\r\naltogether aweary of Japan.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, certain that the closure of the English factory at\r\nHirado was voluntary; from the beginning to the end no serious\r\nfriction had occurred between the English and the Japanese. When, the\r\nformer withdrew from the Japanese trade, their houses and stores at\r\nHirado were not sold, but were left in the safe-keeping of the local\r\nfeudatory, who promised to restore them to their original owners\r\nshould the English company desire to re-open business in Japan. The\r\ncompany did think of doing so on more than one occasion, but the idea\r\ndid not mature until the year 1673, when a merchantman, the Return,\r\nwas sent to obtain permission. \"The Japanese authorities, after\r\nmature reflection, made answer that as the king of England was\r\nmarried to a Portuguese princess, British subjects could not be\r\npermitted to visit Japan. That this reply was suggested by the Dutch\r\nis very probable; that it truly reflected the feeling of the Japanese\r\nGovernment towards Roman Catholics is certain.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica (11th Edition)'; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE PORTUGUESE TRADE WITH JAPAN\r\n\r\nIn the year 1624, the expulsion of the Spaniards from Japan took\r\nplace, and in 1638 the Portuguese met the same fate. Two years prior\r\nto the latter event, the Yedo Bakufu adopted a measure which\r\neffectually terminated foreign intercourse. They ruled that to leave\r\nthe country, or to attempt to do so, should constitute a capital\r\ncrime; that any Japanese subject residing abroad should be executed\r\nif he returned; that the entire kith and kin of the Spaniards in\r\nJapan should be expelled, and that no ships of ocean-going dimensions\r\nshould be built in Japan. This meant not only the driving out of all\r\nprofessing Christians, but also the imprisonment of the entire nation\r\nwithin the limits of the Japanese islands, as well as an effectual\r\nveto on the growth of the mercantile marine. It is worth noting that\r\nno act of spoliation was practised against these tabooed people.\r\nThus, when those indicated by the edict--to the number of 287--left\r\nthe country for Macao, they were allowed to carry away with them\r\ntheir whole fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the Spaniards did not leave the Portuguese in an\r\nimproved condition. Humiliating restrictions continued to be imposed\r\nupon them. If a foreign priest were found upon any galleon bound for\r\nJapan, such priest and the whole of the crew of the galleon were\r\nliable to be executed, and many other irksome conditions were\r\ninstituted for the control of the trade. Nor had the aliens even the\r\nsatisfaction of an open market, for all the goods carried in their\r\ngalleons had to be sold at a fixed price to a ring of licensed\r\nJapanese merchants from Osaka. In spite of all these deterrents,\r\nhowever, the Portuguese continued to send galleons to Nagasaki until\r\nthe year 1637, when their alleged connexion with the Shimabara\r\nrebellion induced the Japanese to issue the final edict that\r\nhenceforth any Portuguese ship coming to Japan should be burned,\r\ntogether with her cargo, and everyone on board should be executed.\r\n\r\nThis law was not enforced with any undue haste; ample time was given\r\nfor compliance with its provisions. Possibly misled by this\r\nprocrastination, the Portuguese at Macao continued to strive for the\r\nre-establishment of commercial relations until 1640, when a very sad\r\nevent put an end finally to all intercourse. Four aged men, selected\r\nfrom among the most respected citizens of Macao, were sent to\r\nNagasaki as ambassadors. Their ships carried rich presents and an\r\nearnest petition for the renewal of commercial intercourse. They were\r\nat once imprisoned, and having declined to save their lives by\r\nabjuring the Christian faith, the four old men and fifty-seven of\r\ntheir companions were decapitated, thirteen only being left alive for\r\nthe purpose of conveying the facts to Macao. To these thirteen there\r\nwas handed at their departure a document setting forth that, \"So long\r\nas the sun warms the earth, any Christian bold enough to come to\r\nJapan, even if he be King Philip himself or the God of the\r\nChristians, shall pay for it with his head.\" One more effort to\r\nrestore the old intimacy was made by the Portuguese in 1647, but it\r\nfailed signally, and would certainly have entailed sanguinary results\r\nhad not the two Portuguese vessels beat a timely retreat.\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH AT DESHIMA\r\n\r\nIn 1609, the Dutch made their appearance in Japan, and received an\r\nexcellent welcome. Ieyasu gave them a written promise that \"no man\r\nshould do them any wrong and that they should be maintained and\r\ndefended as his own vassals.\" He also granted them a charter that\r\nwherever their ships entered, they should be shown \"all manner of\r\nhelp, favour, and assistance.\" Left free to choose their own trading\r\nport, they made the mistake of selecting Hirado, which was eminently\r\nunsuited to be a permanent emporium of interstate commerce.\r\nNevertheless, owing partly to their shrewdness, partly to their\r\nexclusive possession of the Spice Islands, and partly to their\r\nbelligerent co-operation with the English against the Spaniards, they\r\nsucceeded in faring prosperously for a time.\r\n\r\nThe day came, however, when, being deprived of freedom of trade and\r\nlimited to dealings with a guild of Nagasaki and Osaka merchants,\r\nthey found their gains seriously affected. Other vicissitudes\r\novertook them, and finally the Japanese concluded that the safest\r\ncourse was to confine the Dutch to some position where, in a moment\r\nof emergency, they could easily be brought under Japanese control.\r\nNagasaki was chosen as suitable, and there a Dutch factory was\r\nestablished which, for a time, flourished satisfactorily. From seven\r\nto ten Dutch vessels used to enter the port annually--their cargoes\r\nvalued at some eighty thousand pounds (avdp.) of silver, and the\r\nchief staples of import being silk and piece-goods. Customs duties\r\namounting to five per cent, were levied; 495 pounds of silver had to\r\nbe paid annually as a rent for the little island of Deshima, and\r\nevery year a mission had to proceed to Yedo from the factory,\r\ncarrying presents for the chief Bakufu officials, which presents are\r\nsaid to have aggregated some 550 pounds of silver on each occasion.\r\nThe Dutch traders, nevertheless, found their business profitable\r\nowing to purchases of gold and copper, which metals could be procured\r\nin Japan at much lower rates than they commanded in Europe. Thus, the\r\nnow familiar question of an outflow of specie was forced upon\r\nJapanese attention at that early date, and, by way of remedy, the\r\nGovernment adopted, in 1790, the policy of restricting to one vessel\r\nannually the Dutch ships entering Nagasaki, and forbidding that\r\nvessel to carry away more than 350 tons of copper.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS PRODUCED UPON JAPAN BY THE POLICY OF EXCLUSION\r\n\r\nWhatever losses Japan's policy of seclusion caused to the nations\r\nwhich were its victims, there can be no doubt that she herself was\r\nthe chief sufferer. During two and a half centuries she remained\r\nwithout breathing the atmosphere of international competition, or\r\nderiving inspiration from an exchange of ideas with other countries.\r\nWhile the world moved steadily forward, Japan stood practically\r\nunchanging, and when ultimately she emerged into contact with the\r\nOccident, she found herself separated by an immense interval from the\r\nmaterial civilization it had developed.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the Japan of the middle of the sixteenth and\r\nthat of the middle of the seventeenth century has often been made by\r\nthe historian of foreign influence. In 1541 the country was open to\r\nforeign trade, foreign civilization and foreign ideas and these were\r\nwelcomed eagerly and, in accordance with the remarkable natural\r\naptitude of the Japanese for adaptation, were readily assimilated.\r\nNot only were foreign traders allowed to come to Japan, but Japanese\r\nwere allowed to go abroad. And all this was in the line of a\r\nlong-continued Japanese policy--the policy thanks to which Chinese\r\ninfluence had made itself so strongly felt in Japan, and which had\r\nbrought in Buddhism and Confucianism, not to speak of arts and\r\nletters of foreign provenance.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the hundred years, in 1641, all was changed. Japan\r\nwas absolutely isolated. Foreigners were forbidden to enter, except\r\nthe Dutch traders who were confined to the little island of Deshima.\r\nAnd natives were forbidden to go out, or to accept at home the\r\nreligious teachings of foreigners. Only ships suited for the\r\ncoastwise trade might be built. The nation's intercourse with\r\nOccidental civilization was shut off, and its natural power of change\r\nand growth through foreign influences was thus held in check. The\r\nwonder is that it was not destroyed by this inhibition. The whole\r\nstory of foreign intercourse as it has so far been told makes it\r\nplain that the reason why it was prohibited was in the nature of\r\nforeign propaganda and not in any unreadiness of the Japanese for\r\nwestern civilization.\r\n\r\nSECOND ERA OF FOREIGN TRADE\r\n\r\nJapan's seclusion was maintained unflinchingly. But, though her goods\r\nfound a market in China, only during her period of self-effacement,\r\nthe reputation of her people for military prowess was such that no\r\noutside nation thought of forcing her to open her ports. A British\r\nseaman, Sir Edward Michelborne, in the sequel of a fight between his\r\ntwo ships and a Japanese junk near Singapore, left a record that \"The\r\nJapanese are not allowed to land in any part of India with weapons,\r\nbeing a people so desperate and daring that they are feared in all\r\nplaces where they come.\" Nevertheless, Russian subjects, their shores\r\nbeing contiguous with those of Japan, occasionally found their way as\r\nsailors or colonists into the waters of Saghalien, the Kuriles, and\r\nYezo. The Japanese did not then exercise effective control over Yezo,\r\nalthough the island was nominally under their jurisdiction. Its\r\ngovernment changed from one hand to another in the centuries that\r\nseparated the Kamakura epoch from the Tokugawa, and in the latter\r\nepoch we find the Matsumae daimyo ruling all the islands northward of\r\nthe Tsugaru Straits. But the Matsumae administration contented itself\r\nwith imposing taxes and left the people severely alone. Thus, when in\r\n1778, a small party of Russians appeared at Nemuro seeking trade, no\r\npreparations existed to impose the local government's will on the\r\nstrangers. They were simply promised an answer in the following year,\r\nand that answer proved to be that all Japan's oversea trade must by\r\nlaw be confined to Nagasaki.\r\n\r\nThe Russians did not attempt to dispute this ruling. They retired\r\nquietly. But their two visits had shown them that Yezo was capable of\r\nmuch development, and they gradually began to flock thither as\r\ncolonists. Officials sent from Japan proper to make an investigation\r\nreported that Kamchatka, hitherto a dependency of Japan, had been\r\ntaken possession of by Russians, who had established themselves in\r\nthe island of Urup and at other places. The report added that the\r\nsituation would be altogether lost unless resolute steps were taken\r\nto restore it. Unfortunately, the death of the tenth shogun having\r\njust then occurred, the Yedo Court found it inconvenient to take\r\naction in remote Yezo. Thus, Russian immigration and Japanese\r\ninaction continued for some time, and not until 1792 were commissions\r\nagain despatched from Yedo to inquire and report. They made an\r\nexhaustive investigation, and just as it reached the hands of the\r\nBakufu, a large Russian vessel arrived off Nemuro, carrying some\r\nship-wrecked Japanese sailors whom her commander offered to restore\r\nto their country, accompanying this offer with an application for the\r\nopening of trade between Russia and Japan. Negotiations ensued, the\r\nresult being that Nagasaki was again referred to as the only port\r\nwhere foreign trade might be lawfully conducted, and the Russians,\r\ntherefore, declared their intention of proceeding thither, a passport\r\nbeing handed to them for the purpose. It does not appear, however,\r\nthat they availed themselves of this permit, and in the mean while\r\nthe Yedo commissioners pursued their journey northward, and pulled up\r\na number of boundary posts which had been erected by the Russians in\r\nUrup.\r\n\r\nThe Bakufu now began to appreciate the situation more fully. They\r\ntook under their own immediate control the eastern half of Yezo,\r\nentrusting the western half to Matsumae. The next incident of note\r\nwas a survey of the northern islands, made in 1800 by the famous\r\nmathematician, Ino Tadayoshi, and the despatch of another party of\r\nBakufu investigators. Nothing practical was done, however, and, in\r\n1804, a Russian ship arrived at Nagasaki carrying a number of\r\nJapanese castaways and again applying for permission to trade. But it\r\nsoon appeared that the Bakufu were playing fast and loose with their\r\nvisitors and that they had no intention of sanctioning general\r\nforeign commerce, even at Nagasaki. Incensed by such treatment, the\r\nRussians, in 1806, invaded Saghalien, carried away several Japanese\r\nsoldiers, and partially raided Etorop and other places. They\r\nthreatened further violence in the following year unless\r\ninternational trade was sanctioned.\r\n\r\nThe Bakufu had now a serious problem to solve, and their ideas of its\r\nsolution were almost comical. Thus, one statesman recommended the\r\norganization of a special force recruited from the ranks of vagrants\r\nand criminals and stationed permanently in the northern islands, A\r\nmore practical programme was the formation of a local militia. But\r\nneither of these suggestions obtained approval, nor was anything done\r\nbeyond removing the Matsumae feudatory and placing the whole of the\r\nislands under the direct sway of the Bakufu.\r\n\r\nFor a period of five years after these events the Russians made no\r\nfurther attempt to establish relations with Japan, and their next\r\nessay, namely, the despatch of a warship--the Diana--to survey the\r\nYezo coasts, was unceremoniously interrupted by the Japanese. Another\r\nvessel flying the Russian flag visited Kunajiri, in 1814. On that\r\noccasion the Japanese managed to seize some members of the Russian\r\ncrew, who were ultimately saved by the shrewdness of one of their\r\nofficers. These events imparted fresh vigour to Japan's prejudices\r\nagainst foreign intercourse, but, as for the Russians, not a few of\r\nthem found their way to Saghalien and settled there without any\r\nresolute attempt on the part of the Bakufu to expel them.\r\n\r\nCOAST DEFENCE\r\n\r\nOne effect of the events related above was to direct Japanese\r\nattention to the necessity of coast defence, a subject which derived\r\nmuch importance from information filtering through the Dutch door at\r\nNagasaki. Under the latter influence a remarkable book (Kai-koku\r\nHei-dan) was compiled by Hayashi Shibei, who had associated for some\r\ntime with the Dutch at Deshima. He urged frankly that Japan must\r\nremain helpless for naval purposes if her people were forbidden to\r\nbuild ocean-going vessels while foreigners sailed the high seas, and\r\nhe further urged that attention should be paid to coast defence, so\r\nthat the country might not be wholly at the mercy of foreign\r\nadventurers. The brave author was thrown into prison and the\r\nprinting-blocks of his book were destroyed, but his enlightenment\r\nbore some fruit, for immediately afterwards the Bakufu prime minister\r\nmade a journey along the coasts of the empire to select points for\r\nthe erection of fortifications, and to encourage the feudatories to\r\ntake steps for guarding these important positions.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN LITERATURE\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that in the days of the shogun Yoshimune\r\n(1716-1745) the veto against studying foreign books was removed. But\r\nfor some time this liberal measure produced no practical effect,\r\nsince there did not exist even a Dutch-Japanese vocabulary to open\r\nthe pages of foreign literature for Japanese study. Indeed, very few\r\nbooks were procurable from the Dutch at Deshima. The most accessible\r\nwere treatises on medicine and anatomy, and the illustrations in\r\nthese volumes served as a guide for interpreting their contents.\r\nEarnestness well-nigh incredible was shown by Japanese students in\r\ndeciphering the strange terms, and presently the country was placed\r\nin possession of The History of Russia, Notes on the Northern\r\nIslands, Universal Geography, A Compendium of Dutch Literature,\r\nTreatises on the Art of Translation, a Dutch-Japanese Dictionary and\r\nso forth, the immediate result being a nascent public conviction of\r\nthe necessity of opening the country,--a conviction which, though not\r\nwidely held, contributed materially to the ultimate fall of the\r\nBakufu.\r\n\r\nThe Yedo Court, however, clung tenaciously to its hereditary\r\nconservatism. Thus, in 1825, the Bakufu issued a general order that\r\nany foreign vessel coming within range of the coast batteries should\r\nat once be fired upon, and not until 1842 was this harsh command\r\nmodified in the sense that a ship driven into a Japanese port by\r\nstress of weather might be given food, water, and provisions, but\r\nshould be warned to resume her voyage immediately. Meanwhile,\r\nstrenuous efforts were made to strengthen the littoral defences, and\r\na very active revival of the study of the military art took place\r\nthroughout the empire, though, at the same time, the number of\r\npatriots sufficiently brave and clear-sighted to condemn the policy\r\nof seclusion grew steadily.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: \"OHARAME\" (A FEMALE LABOURER IN THE SUBURBS OF KYOTO)\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: TWO DRUMS AND TSUZUMI--A and D are Drums; B and C are\r\nTsuzumi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS AND THE DECLINE OF THE TOKUGAWA: (Continued)\r\n\r\nTHE TWELFTH SHOGUN, IEYOSHI (1838-1853)\r\n\r\nFROM the period of this shogun the strength of the Bakufu began to\r\nwane steadily, and the restoration of the administrative power to the\r\nsovereign came to be discussed, with bated breath at first, but\r\ngradually with increased freedom. It is undeniable, however, that the\r\ndecline of the Tokugawa was due as much to an empty treasury as to\r\nthe complications of foreign intercourse. The financial situation in\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century may be briefly described as\r\none of expenditures constantly exceeding income, and of repeated\r\nrecourse by the Bakufu to the fatal expedient of debasing the\r\ncurrency. Public respect was steadily undermined by these displays of\r\nimpecuniosity, and the feudatories in the west of the empire--that is\r\nto say, the tozama daimyo, whose loyalty to the Bakufu was weak at\r\nthe best--found an opportunity to assert themselves against the Yedo\r\nadministration, while the appreciation of commodities rendered the\r\nburden of living constantly more severe and thus helped to alienate\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nSUMPTUARY LAWS\r\n\r\nWhile with one hand scattering abroad debased tokens of exchange, the\r\nBakufu legislators laboured strenuously with the other to check\r\nluxury and extravagance. Conspicuous among the statesmen who sought\r\nto restore the economical habit of former days was Mizuno Echizen no\r\nKami, who, in 1826 and the immediately subsequent years, promulgated\r\ndecree after decree vetoing everything in the nature of needless\r\nexpenditures. It fared with his attempt as it always does with such\r\nlegislation. People admired the vetoes in theory but paid little\r\nattention to them in practice.\r\n\r\nFAMINE IN THE TEMPO ERA (1830-1844)\r\n\r\nFrom 1836 onward, through successive years, one bad harvest followed\r\nanother until the prices of rice and other cereals rose to\r\nunprecedented figures. The Bakufu were not remiss in their measures\r\nto relieve distress. Free grants of grain were made in the most\r\nafflicted regions; houses of refuge were constructed where the\r\nindigent might be fed and lodged during a maximum period of 210 days,\r\neach inmate receiving in addition a daily allowance of money which\r\nwas handed to him on leaving the refuge, and this example of charity\r\nwas obeyed widely by the feudatories. It is on record that twenty\r\nthousand persons availed themselves of these charitable institutions\r\nin Yedo alone. One particularly sad episode marks the story. Driven\r\nto desperation by the sight of the people's pain and by his own\r\nfailure to obtain from wealthy folks a sufficient measure of aid,\r\nalthough he sold everything he himself possessed by way of example, a\r\npolice official, Oshio Heihachiro, raised the flag of revolt and\r\nbecame the instrument of starting a tumult in which eighteen thousand\r\nbuildings were destroyed in Osaka. In a manifesto issued before\r\ncommitting suicide in company with his son, Heihachiro charged the\r\nwhole body of officials with corrupt motives, and declared that the\r\nsovereign was treated as a recluse without any practical authority;\r\nthat the people did not know where to make complaint; that the\r\ndispleasure of heaven was evinced by a succession of natural\r\ncalamities, and that the men in power paid no attention to these\r\nwarnings.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh shogun, Ienari, after fifty-one years of office,\r\nresigned in favour of his son, Ieyoshi, who ruled from 1838 to 1853.\r\nIenari survived his resignation by four years, during which he\r\nresided in the western castle, and, under the title of o-gosho,\r\ncontinued to take part in the administration. As for Ieyoshi, his\r\ntenure of power is chiefly notable for the strenuous efforts made by\r\nhis prime minister, Mizuno Echizen no Kami, to substitute economy for\r\nthe costly luxury that prevailed. Reference has already been made to\r\nthis eminent official's policy, and it will suffice here to add that\r\nhis aim was to restore the austere fashions of former times. The\r\nschedule of reforms was practically endless. Expensive costumes were\r\nseized and burned; theatres were relegated to a remote suburb of the\r\ncity; actors were ostracized; a censorship of publications checked\r\nunder severe penalties the compilation of all anti-foreign or immoral\r\nliterature, and even children's toys were legislated for.\r\n\r\nAt first these laws alarmed people, but it was soon found that\r\ncompetence to enforce was not commensurate with ability to compile,\r\nand the only result achieved was that splendour and extravagance were\r\nmore or less concealed. Yet the Bakufu officials did not hesitate to\r\nresort to force. It is recorded that storehouses and residences were\r\nsealed and their inmates banished; that no less than 570 restaurants\r\nwere removed from the most populous part of the city, and that the\r\nmaidservants employed in them were all degraded to the class of\r\n\"licensed prostitutes.\" This drastic effort went down in the pages of\r\nhistory as the \"Tempo Reformation.\" It ended in the resignation of\r\nits author and the complete defeat of its purpose.\r\n\r\nTOKUGAWA NARIAKI\r\n\r\nContemporaneous with the wholesale reformer, Mizuno, was Tokugawa\r\nNariaki (1800-1860), daimyo of Mito, who opposed the conciliatory\r\nforeign policy, soon to be described, of Ii Naosuke (Kamon no Kami).\r\nNariaki inherited the literary tastes of his ancestor, Mitsukuni, and\r\nat his court a number of earnest students and loyal soldiers\r\nassembled. Among them were Fujita Toko (1806-1855) and Toda Tadanori,\r\nwho are not less remarkable as scholars and historians than as\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nJapan now began to make the acquaintance of American citizens, who,\r\npursuing the whaling industry in the seas off Alaska and China,\r\npassed frequently in their ships within easy sight of the island of\r\nYezo. Occasionally, one of these schooners was cast away on Japan's\r\nshores, and as a rule, her people were treated with consideration and\r\nsent to Deshima for shipment to Batavia. Japanese sailors, also, were\r\noccasionally swept by hurricanes and currents to the Aleutian\r\nIslands, to Oregon, or to California, and in several cases these\r\nmariners were sent back to Japan by American vessels. It was on such\r\nan errand of mercy that the sailing ship Morrison entered Yedo Bay,\r\nin 1837, and being required to repair to Kagoshima, was driven from\r\nthe latter place by cannon shot. It was on such an errand, also, that\r\nthe Manhattan reached Uraga and lay there four days before she was\r\ncompelled to take her departure. It would seem that the experiences\r\ncollected by Cooper, master of the latter vessel, and published after\r\nhis return to the United States, induced the Washington Government to\r\nessay the opening of Japan. A ninety-gun ship of the line and a\r\nsloop, sent on this errand, anchored off Uraga in 1846, and their\r\ncommander, Commodore Biddle, applied for the sanction of trade. He\r\nreceived a positive refusal, and in pursuance of his instructions to\r\nabstain from any act calculated to excite hostility or distrust, he\r\nweighed anchor and sailed away.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN AND OTHER POWERS\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1846, a French ship touched at the Ryukyu\r\narchipelago, and attempted to persuade the islanders that if they\r\nwished for security against British aggression, they must place\r\nthemselves under the protection of France. England, indeed, was now\r\nmuch in evidence in the seas of southern China, and the Dutch at\r\nDeshima, obeying the instincts of commercial rivalry, warned Japan\r\nthat she must be prepared for a visit from an English squadron at any\r\nmoment. The King of Holland now (1847) intervened. He sent to Yedo a\r\nnumber of books together with a map of the world and a despatch\r\nurging Japan to open her ports. This was not done for Japan's sake.\r\nThe apparent explanation is that the trade at Deshima having ceased\r\nto be worth pursuing, the Dutch East India Company had surrendered\r\nits monopoly to the Netherlands Government, so that the latter's\r\nadvice to Japan is explained. But his Majesty's efforts had no\r\nimmediate result, though they doubtless augmented Japan's feeling of\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nTwelve months later, the Preble, an American brig under Commander\r\nGlynn, anchored off Nagasaki and threatened to bombard the town\r\nunless immediate delivery was made of fifteen foreign seamen held by\r\nthe Japanese for shipment to Batavia. The castaways were surrendered,\r\nand Commander Glynn found evidence to prove that Japan was by no\r\nmeans ignorant of American doings in Mexico, and that she was\r\nbeginning to comprehend how close the world was approaching her\r\nshores. Once again in the following year (1849), the King of Holland\r\nwrote, telling the Japanese to expect an American fleet in their\r\nwaters twelve months later, and to look for war unless they agreed to\r\ninternational commerce. This was no empty threat. The Washington\r\nGovernment had actually addressed to European nations a memorandum\r\njustifying an expedition to Japan on the ground that it would inure\r\nto the advantage of all, and the King of Holland appended to his\r\nletter a draft of the treaty which would be presented in Yedo. \"All\r\nthese things render it obvious that in the matter of renewing their\r\nrelations with the outer world, the Japanese were not required to\r\nmake any sudden decision under stress of unexpected menace; they had\r\nample notice of the course events were taking.\"\r\n\r\nTHE 121ST SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR KOMEI (A.D. 1846-1867)\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Ninko died in 1846 and was succeeded by his son, Komei,\r\nthe 121st sovereign. The country's foreign relations soon became a\r\nsource of profound concern to the new ruler. Among the Court nobles\r\nthere had developed in Ninko's reign a strong desire to make their\r\ninfluence felt in the administration of the empire, and thus to\r\nemerge from the insignificant position to which the Bakufu system\r\ncondemned them. In obedience to their suggestions, the Emperor Ninko\r\nestablished a special college for the education of Court nobles, from\r\nthe age of fifteen to that of forty. This step does not seem to have\r\ncaused any concern to the Bakufu officials. The college was duly\r\norganized under the name of Gakushu-jo (afterwards changed to\r\nGakushu-iri). The Yedo treasury went so far as to contribute a\r\nsubstantial sum to the support of the institution, and early in the\r\nreign of Komei the nobles began to look at life with eyes changed by\r\nthe teaching thus afforded. Instructors at the college were chosen\r\namong the descendants of the immortal scholars, Abe no Seimei,\r\nSugawara no Michizane, and others scarcely less renowned. The Emperor\r\nNinko had left instructions that four precepts should be inscribed\r\nconspicuously in the halls of the college, namely:\r\n\r\nWalk in the paths trodden by the feet of the great sages.\r\n\r\nRevere the righteous canons of the empire.\r\n\r\nHe that has not learned the sacred doctrines, how can he govern\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\nHe that is ignorant of the classics, how can he regulate his own\r\nconduct?\r\n\r\nA manifest sign of the times, the portals of this college were soon\r\nthronged by Court nobles, and the Imperial capital began to awake\r\nfrom its sleep of centuries. The Emperor himself evinced his\r\nsolicitude about foreign relations by fasting and by praying at the\r\nshrines of the national deities, his Majesty's constant formula of\r\nworship being a supplication that his life might be accepted as a\r\nsubstitute for the safety of his country. The fact was that the\r\noverthrow of the Yedo Bakufu had begun to constitute an absorbing\r\nobject with many of the high officials in Kyoto. It had hitherto been\r\nan invariable rule that any policy contemplated in Yedo became an\r\naccomplished fact before a report was presented in the Imperial\r\ncapital. But very soon after his coronation, the Emperor Komei\r\ndeparted from this time-honoured sequence of procedure and formally\r\ninstructed the Bakufu that the traditional policy of the empire in\r\nforeign affairs must be strictly maintained. The early Tokugawa\r\nshoguns would have strongly resented such interference, but times had\r\nchanged, and Ieyoshi bowed his head quietly to the new order.\r\nThenceforth the Bakufu submitted all questions of foreign policy to\r\nthe Imperial Court before final decision.\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE PERRY\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853, Commodore Perry of the United States Navy appeared\r\nin Uraga Bay with a squadron of four warships and 560 men. The advent\r\nof such a force created much perturbation in Yedo. Instead of dealing\r\nwith the affair on their own absolute authority, the Bakufu summoned\r\na council of the feudatories to discuss the necessary steps.\r\nMeanwhile, the shogun, who had been ill for some time, died, and his\r\ndecease was pleaded as a pretext for postponing discussion with the\r\nAmericans. Perry being without authority to resort to force, did not\r\npress his point. He transmitted the President's letter to the\r\nsovereign of Japan, and steamed away on the 17th of July, declaring\r\nhis intention to return in the following year. This letter was\r\ncirculated among the feudatories, who were invited to express their\r\nopinions on the document. Their replies are worthy of perusal as\r\npresenting a clear idea of Japanese views at that time with regard to\r\nforeign intercourse. The gist of the replies may be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n-The ultimate purpose of foreigners in visiting Japan is to\r\nreconnoitre the country. This is proved by the action of the Russians\r\nin the north. What has been done by Western States in India and China\r\nwould doubtless be done in Japan also if opportunity offered. Even\r\nthe Dutch are not free from suspicion of acting the part of spies.\r\n\r\n-Foreign trade, so far from benefitting the nation, cannot fail to\r\nimpoverish it, inasmuch as oversea commerce simply means that,\r\nwhereas Japan receives a number of unnecessary luxuries, she has to\r\ngive in exchange quantities of precious metals.\r\n\r\n-To permit foreign intercourse would be to revoke the law of\r\nexclusion which has been enforced for centuries, and which was the\r\noutcome of practical experience.\r\n\r\nThese opinions were subscribed by a great majority of the\r\nfeudatories. A few, however, had sufficient foresight and courage to\r\nadvocate foreign intercourse. The leaders of this small minority\r\nwere, Ii Naosuke, baron of Hikone, historically remembered as Ii\r\nKamon no Kami; Toda Izu no Kami, bugyo of Uraga; Takashima Kihei\r\n(called also Shirodayu, or Shuhan); Egawa Tarozaemon, bugyo of\r\nNirayama; and Otsuki Heiji, a vassal of the baron of Sendai. The\r\nviews of these statesmen may be briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n-It is not to be denied that many illustrious and patriotic men,\r\nanticipating injury to the country's fortunes and perversion of the\r\nnation's moral canons, are implacably opposed to foreign intercourse.\r\nBut the circumstances of the time render it impossible to maintain\r\nthe integrity of the empire side by side with the policy of\r\nseclusion. The coasts are virtually unprotected. The country is\r\npractically without a navy. Throughout a period of nearly two and a\r\nhalf centuries the building of any ship having a capacity of over one\r\nhundred koku has been forbidden, and in the absence of war-vessels\r\nthere is no means of defence except coast batteries, which are\r\npractically non-existent.\r\n\r\n-When inaugurating the policy of seclusion, the Bakufu Government\r\ntook care to leave China and Holland as a bridge between Japan and\r\nthe rest of the world. It will be wise to utilize that bridge for\r\ndealing with foreign States, so as to gain time for preparations of\r\ndefence, instead of rushing blindly into battle without any supply of\r\neffective weapons. If the Americans have need of coal, there is an\r\nabundant supply in Kyushu. If they require provisions and water,\r\ntheir needs can easily be satisfied. As for returning distressed\r\nforeign seamen, that has hitherto been done voluntarily, and an\r\narrangement on this subject can be made through the medium of the\r\nDutch. As for foreign trade, the times have changed radically since a\r\nveto was imposed on all commercial transactions, and it by no means\r\nfollows that what was wise then is expedient now. Japan must have\r\nocean-going vessels, and these cannot be procured in a moment. Her\r\nbest way is to avail herself of the services of the Dutch as\r\nmiddlemen in trade, and to lose no time in furnishing herself with\r\npowerful men-of-war and with sailors and gunners capable of\r\nnavigating and fighting these vessels.\r\n\r\n-In short, the wisest plan is to make a show of commerce and\r\nintercourse, and thus gain time to equip the country with a knowledge\r\nof naval architecture and warfare. The two things most essential are\r\nthat Christianity should not be admitted in the train of foreign\r\ntrade, and that the strictest economy should be exercised by all\r\nclasses of the people so as to provide funds for the building of a\r\nnavy and the fortification of the coasts.\r\n\r\nThe question alluded to at the close of the above, namely, the\r\nquestion of finance, was a paramount difficulty for the Bakufu. In\r\nthe very year of Perry's coming, a member of the Cabinet in Yedo\r\nwrote as follows to Fujita Toko, chief adviser of the Mito feudatory:\r\n\"Unless I tell you frankly about the condition of the treasury you\r\ncannot appreciate the situation. If you saw the accounts you would be\r\nstartled, and would learn at a glance the hopelessness of going to\r\nwar. The country could not hold out even for a twelvemonth, and there\r\nis nothing for it except that everyone should join in saving money\r\nfor purposes of equipment. If we keep the peace now and toil\r\nunremittingly for ten years, we may hope to restore the situation.\"\r\nIn truth, the Bakufu had practically no choice. \"On one hand,\r\nthousands of publicists, who believed themselves patriotic, clamoured\r\nfor the policy of seclusion, even at the cost of war; on the other,\r\nthe Yedo Government knew that to fight must be to incur crushing\r\ndefeat.\" The Bakufu then issued the following temporizing decree:\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the despatch from the United States Government, the\r\nviews of competent men have been taken and have been carefully\r\nconsidered by the shogun. The views expressed are variously worded\r\nbut they advocate either peace or war. Everyone has pointed out that\r\nwe are without a navy and that our coasts are undefended. Meanwhile,\r\nthe Americans will be here again next year. Our policy shall be to\r\nevade any definite answer to their request, while at the same time\r\nmaintaining a peaceful demeanour. It may be, however, that they will\r\nhave recourse to violence. For that contingency we must be prepared\r\nlest the country suffer disgrace. Therefore every possible effort\r\nwill be made to prepare means of defence. Above all it is imperative\r\nthat everyone should practise patience, refrain from anger, and\r\ncarefully observe the conduct of the foreigners. Should they open\r\nhostilities, all must at once take up arms and fight strenuously for\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\nA less vertebrate policy could scarcely have been formulated, but the\r\nconduct of the Bakufu statesmen was more stalwart than their\r\nlanguage. Under the guidance of Abe Masahiro, one of the ablest\r\nstatesmen that Yedo ever possessed, batteries were built at Shinagawa\r\nto guard the approaches to Yedo; defensive preparations were made\r\nalong the coasts of Musashi, Sagami, Awa, and Kazusa; the veto\r\nagainst the construction of ocean-going ships was rescinded, and the\r\nfeudatories were invited to build and arm large vessels; a commission\r\nwas given to the Dutch at Deshima to procure from Europe a library of\r\nuseful books; cannon were cast; troops were drilled, and everyone who\r\nhad acquired expert knowledge through the medium of the Dutch was\r\ntaken into official favour.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut all these efforts tended only to expose their own feebleness, and\r\non the 2nd of November, 1853, instructions were issued that if the\r\nAmericans returned, they were to be dealt with peacefully. \"In short,\r\nthe sight of Perry's steam-propelled ships, their powerful armament,\r\nand the specimens they carried of Western wonders had practically\r\nbroken down the barriers of Japan's isolation without any need of\r\ntreaties or conventions.\" Thus, when the American commodore returned\r\nin the following February with ten ships and crews numbering two\r\nthousand, he easily obtained a treaty by which Japan promised kind\r\ntreatment to shipwrecked sailors; permission to foreign vessels to\r\nobtain stores and provisions within her territory, and an engagement\r\nthat American vessels might anchor in the ports of Shimoda and\r\nHakata. Much has been written about Perry's judicious display of\r\nforce and about his sagacious tact in dealing with the Japanese, but\r\nit may be doubted whether the consequences of his exploit did not\r\ninvest its methods with extravagant lustre.\r\n\r\nTREATIES OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\nRussia, Holland, and England speedily obtained treaties similar to\r\nthat concluded by Commodore Perry in 1854. These, however, were not\r\ncommercial conventions. It was reserved for Mr. Townsend Harris,\r\nAmerican consul-general in Japan, to open the country to trade.\r\nArriving in August, 1856, he concluded in March, 1857, a treaty\r\nsecuring to United States citizens the right of permanent residence\r\nat Shimoda and Hakodate, as well as that of carrying on trade at\r\nNagasaki and establishing consular jurisdiction. Nevertheless,\r\nnothing worthy to be called commercial intercourse was allowed by the\r\nBakufu, and it was not until Mr. Harris, with infinite patience and\r\ntact, had gone to Yedo alter ten months' delay that he secured the\r\nopening of ports other than Nagasaki to international commerce. In\r\nthis achievement he was assisted by Hotta Masamutsu, successor to the\r\ngreat Masahiro, and, like most of his colleagues, a sincere advocate\r\nof opening the country.\r\n\r\nJapan has been much blamed for her reluctance in this matter, but\r\nwhen we recall the danger to which the Yedo administration was\r\nexposed by its own weakness, and when we observe that a strong\r\nsentiment was growing up in favour of abolishing the dual form of\r\ngovernment, we can easily appreciate that to sanction commercial\r\nrelations might well have shaken the Bakufu to their foundations. It\r\nwas possible to construe the Perry convention and the first Harris\r\nconvention as mere acts of benevolence towards strangers, but a\r\ncommercial treaty would not have lent itself to any such\r\nconstruction. We cannot wonder that the shogun's ministers hesitated\r\nto take an apparently suicidal step. They again consulted the\r\nfeudatories and again received an almost unanimously unfavourable\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nIn fact, history has preserved only one unequivocal expression of\r\nconsent. It was formulated by Matsudaira Yoshinaga, baron of Echizen.\r\nHe had been among the most ardent exclusionists in the first council\r\nof feudatories; but his views had subsequently undergone a radical\r\nchange, owing to the arguments of one of his vassals, Hashimoto\r\nSanae--elder brother of Viscount Hashimoto Tsunatsune, president of\r\nthe Red Cross Hospital, who died in 1909. \"Not only did this\r\nremarkable man frankly advocate foreign trade for its own sake and as\r\na means of enriching the nation, thus developing its capacity for\r\nindependence, but he also recommended the fostering of industries,\r\nthe purchase of ships and firearms, the study of foreign arts and\r\nsciences, and the despatch of students and publicists to Western\r\ncountries for purposes of instruction. Finally, he laid down the\r\nprinciple that probity is essential to commercial success.\" Such\r\ndoctrines were then much in advance of the time. Nevertheless, Harris\r\nachieved his purpose. He had audience of the shogun in November,\r\n1857, and, on the 29th of the following July, a treaty was concluded\r\nopening Yokohama, from the 1st of July, 1858, to commerce between the\r\nUnited States and Japan.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was concluded in spite of the failure of two attempts to\r\nobtain the sanction of the Throne. Plainly the Bakufu shrank from\r\nopenly adopting a policy which, while recognizing its necessity, they\r\ndistrusted their own ability to force upon the nation. They had,\r\nhowever, promised Mr. Harris that the treaty should be signed, and\r\nthey kept their word at a risk, of whose magnitude the American\r\nconsul-general had no conception. Mr. Harris had brought to this\r\nconference exceptional diplomatic skill and winning tact, but it\r\ncannot be denied that he derived assistance from contemporaneous\r\nevents in China, where the Peiho forts had just been captured and the\r\nChinese forced to sign a treaty. He was thus able to warn the\r\nJapanese that the British and the French fleets might be expected at\r\nany moment to enter Yedo Bay, and that the best way to avert irksome\r\ndemands at the hands of the British was to establish a comparatively\r\nmoderate precedent by yielding to the American proposals.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRTEENTH SHOGUN, IESADA (1853-1858)\r\n\r\nBetween the conclusion of the Harris commercial treaty and its\r\nsignature, the Bakufu prime minister visited Kyoto, for the purpose\r\nof persuading the Imperial Court to abandon its anti-foreign\r\nattitude. His mission was quite unsuccessful, the utmost concession\r\nobtained by him being that the problem of the treaty should be\r\nsubmitted to the feudatories. Another question raised on this\r\noccasion in Kyoto was the succession to the shogunate. The twelfth\r\nshogun, Ieyoshi, had died in 1853, and was succeeded by Iesada, a\r\nphysically incompetent ruler. Iesada had been married to the daughter\r\nof the Satsuma feudatory, as planned by the former Bakufu premier,\r\nAbe, who hoped thus to cement friendly relations with the great\r\nsouthern baron, a hereditary enemy of the Tokugawa. There was no\r\nissue of the marriage, and it being certain that there could be no\r\nissue, two candidates for the shogunate were proposed. They were\r\nKeiki, son of Nariaki of Mito a man of matured intellect and high\r\ncapacities, and Iemochi, son of Nariyuki of Kii, a boy of thirteen.\r\nPublic opinion supported the former, and his connexion with the house\r\nof Mito seemed to assure an anti-foreign bias. Chiefly for the latter\r\nreason, the Court in Kyoto favoured his nomination.\r\n\r\nBut Keiki was not really an advocate of national seclusion. Had the\r\nsuccession been given to him then, he would doubtless have adopted a\r\nliberal policy. On the other hand, his appointment would have been\r\nequivalent to the abdication of Iesada, and in order to avert that\r\ncatastrophe, the shogun's entourage contrived to obtain the\r\nappointment of Ii Kamon no Kami to the post of prime minister in\r\nYedo. This baron was not less capable than courageous. He immediately\r\ncaused the young daimyo of Kii to be nominated successor to the\r\nshogunate, and he signed the Harris treaty. A vehement outcry ensued.\r\nIt was claimed that the will of the Imperial Court had been set at\r\nnought by signing the treaty without the sovereign's sanction, and\r\nthat unconditional yielding to foreign demands was intolerable. The\r\nMito baron headed this opposition. But it is observable that even he\r\ndid not insist upon the maintenance of absolute seclusion. All that\r\nhe and his followers demanded was that a delay should be imposed in\r\norder to obtain time for definite preparation, whereas the premier,\r\nIi, was for the immediate opening of the country.\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTEENTH SHOGUN, IEMOCHI (1858-1866)\r\n\r\nIesada died in 1858, and the reluctance of the Imperial Court to\r\nsanction the succession of Iemochi was evidenced by a long delay in\r\nthe transmission of the necessary Imperial document. During that\r\ninterval, the feudatories of Mito and Echizen had a memorable\r\ninterview with the premier, Ii, whose life seemed at that time to\r\nhang by a thread, but who, nevertheless, advanced unflinchingly\r\ntowards his goal. The three feudatories offered to compromise; in\r\nother words, they declared their willingness to subscribe the\r\ncommercial convention provided that Keiki was appointed shogun; the\r\nimportant fact being thus established that domestic politics had\r\ntaken precedence of foreign. Ii not only declined this offer, but\r\nalso did not hesitate to punish the leaders of the opposition by\r\nconfinement and by temporary exclusion from the Court.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN MILITARY SCIENCE\r\n\r\nIt was during the days of the thirteenth shogun that Japan may be\r\nsaid to have commenced her practical study of foreign military\r\nscience. Instructors were imported from Holland, and a college was\r\nestablished at Nagasaki. Among its graduates were several historical\r\ncharacters, notably Katsu Rintaro, after-wards Count Katsu, minister\r\nof Marine in the Meiji Government. A naval college (Gunkan Kyojujo)\r\nalso was organized at Tsukiji, in Yedo, while at Akunoura, in\r\nNagasaki, an iron-foundry was erected. There, the first attempt at\r\nshipbuilding on foreign lines was made, and there, also, is now\r\nsituated the premier private dockyard in Japan, namely, that of the\r\nMitsubishi Company. Already, in 1854, the Dutch Government had\r\npresented to Japan her first steamship, the Kanko Maru.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES AND THE BAKUFU\r\n\r\nAn indirect consequence of these disputes between the Throne and the\r\nCourt nobles, on one side, and the Bakufu officials, on the other,\r\nwas to perplex the foreign representatives who were now residing in\r\nYedo. These representatives learned to believe that the shogun's\r\nministers were determined either to avoid making treaties or to evade\r\nthem when made. However natural this suspicion may have been, it\r\nlacked solid foundation. That is proved by a memorial which the Yedo\r\nstatesmen addressed to the Throne after the negotiation of the Harris\r\ntreaty. They made it quite plain that they were acting in perfect\r\ngood faith, the only doubtful point in the memorial being that, after\r\nthe organization of a competent army and navy, the problem of peace\r\nor war might be decided. \"If peaceful relations be maintained by\r\nratifying the treaty,\" they wrote, \"the avaricious aliens will\r\ndefinitely see that there is not much wealth in the country, and\r\nthus, abandoning the idea of gain, they will approach us with\r\nfriendly feelings only and ultimately will pass under our Emperor's\r\ngrace. They may then be induced to make grateful offerings to his\r\nMajesty, and it will no longer be a question of trade but of\r\ntribute.\" Something of sinister intention seems to present itself\r\nbetween the lines of this document. But we have to remember that it\r\nwas addressed ultimately to the Kyoto nobles, whose resentment would\r\nhave been at once excited by the use of friendly or self-effacing\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThere is also on record correspondence that passed between the Bakufu\r\npremier, Ii, and certain friends of his in the Imperial capital. From\r\nthese letters it appears that Yedo was advised by the far-seeing\r\nsection of the Kyoto statesmen to simulate the policy of bringing\r\naliens under Japanese influence, and of using for purposes of\r\nmilitary and naval development the wealth that would accrue from\r\noversea trade. In a word, the Bakufu had to disguise their policy in\r\nterms such as might placate the Kyoto conservatives, and this\r\ndeception was once carried so far that an envoy sent to Kyoto from\r\nYedo represented the shogun as hostile at heart to foreigners, though\r\ntolerating them temporarily as a matter of prudence. It cannot be\r\nwondered at that the foreign representatives found much to perplex\r\nthem in these conditions, or that at the legations in Yedo, as well\r\nas among the peoples of Europe and America, an uneasy feeling grew up\r\nthat Japan waited only for an opportunity to repudiate her treaty\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nINTRIGUES IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nAbout this time there began to assemble in the Imperial capital a\r\nnumber of men who, though without social or official status, were at\r\nonce talented; patriotic, and conservative. At their head stood Umeda\r\nGenjiro, who practised as a physician and wrote political brochures\r\nunder the nom de plume of Umpin. He soon became the centre of\r\na circle of loyalists whose motto was Son-0 Jo-I (Revere the\r\nsovereign, expel the barbarians), and associated with him were\r\nRai Miki, a son of Rai Sanyo; Yanagawa Seigan; Yoshida Shoin; Saigo\r\nKichinosuke--better known as Saigo Takamori, the leader of the\r\nSatsuma rebellion of 1877,--Hashimoto Sanae, and others who have been\r\nnot unjustly described as the real motive force that brought about\r\nthe Restoration of 1867.\r\n\r\nThese men soon came to exercise great influence over the Court\r\nnobles--especially Konoe, Takatsukasa, Ichijo, Nijo, and Sanjo--and\r\nwere consequently able to suggest subjects for the sovereign's\r\nrescripts. Thus his Majesty was induced to issue an edict which\r\nconveyed a reprimand to the shogun for concluding a treaty without\r\npreviously referring it to the feudatories, and which suggested that\r\nthe Mito and Owari feudatories should be released from the sentence\r\nof confinement passed on them by Ii Kamon no Kami. This edict\r\nstartled the Bakufu. They at once sent from Yedo envoys to\r\nremonstrate with the conservatives, and after a controversy lasting\r\nfour months, a compromise was effected by which the sovereign\r\npostponed any action for the expulsion of foreigners and the shogun\r\ndeclared that his tolerance of international commerce was only\r\ntemporary. This was regarded as a victory for the shogunate. But the\r\nYedo envoys, during their stay in Kyoto, discovered evidences of a\r\nplot to overthrow the Bakufu. Great severity was shown in dealing\r\nwith this conspiracy. The leaders were beheaded, banished, or ordered\r\nto commit suicide; the Mito feudatory being sentenced to perpetual\r\nconfinement in his fief; the daimyo of Owari, to permanent\r\nretirement; and Keiki, former candidate for the succession to the\r\nshogunate, being deprived of office and directed to live in\r\nseclusion. Many other notable men were subjected to various\r\npenalties, and this \"Great Judgment of Ansei\"--the name of the\r\nera--caused a profound sensation throughout the empire. The nation\r\nmourned for many sincere patriots who had been sentenced on the\r\nflimsiest evidence, and the whole incident tended to accentuate the\r\nunpopularity of foreign intercourse.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: II NAOSUKE\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET EDICT\r\n\r\nThe compromise mentioned above as having been effected between Yedo\r\nand Kyoto had the effect of stultifying the previously drafted edict\r\nwhich condemned the shogun for concluding a treaty without consulting\r\nthe feudatories. The edict had not been publicly promulgated, but it\r\nhad come into the possession of the Mito feudatory, and by his orders\r\nhad been enclosed in the family tomb, where it was guarded night and\r\nday by a strong troop of samurai. The Bakufu insisted that to convey\r\nsuch a document direct from the Throne to a feudatory was a plain\r\ntrespass upon the shogun's authority. Mito, however, refused to\r\nsurrender it. The most uncompromising conservatives of the fief\r\nissued a manifesto justifying their refusal, and, as evidence of\r\ntheir sincerity, committed suicide.\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF II\r\n\r\nNariaki, the Mito baron, now instructed his vassals to surrender the\r\nedict. He may have shared the views of his retainers, but he was not\r\nprepared to assert them by taking up arms against his own family. In\r\nthe face of this instruction the conservative samurai had no choice\r\nbut to disperse or commit suicide. Some twenty of them, however, made\r\ntheir way to Yedo bent upon killing Ii Kamon no Kami, whom they\r\nregarded as the head and front of the evils of the time. The deed was\r\nconsummated on the morning of the 24th of March, 1860, as Ii was on\r\nhis way to the shogun's castle. All the assassins lost their lives or\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE JAPANESE SAMURAI\r\n\r\nThe slaying of Ii was followed by several similar acts, a few against\r\nforeigners and several against Japanese leaders of progress. Many\r\nevil things have been said of the men by whom these deeds of blood\r\nwere perpetrated. But we have always to remember, that in their own\r\neyes they obeyed the teachings of hereditary conviction and the\r\ndictates of patriotism towards their country as well as loyalty\r\ntowards their sovereign. It has been abundantly shown in these pages\r\nthat the original attitude of the Japanese towards foreigners was\r\nhospitable and liberal. It has also been shown how, in the presence\r\nof unwelcome facts, this mood was changed for one of distrust and\r\ndislike. Every Japanese patriot believed when he refused to admit\r\nforeigners to his country in the nineteenth century that he was\r\nobeying the injunctions handed down from the lips of his most\r\nillustrious countrymen, Hideyoshi, Ieyasu, and Iemitsu--believed, in\r\nshort, that to re-admit aliens would be to expose the realm to\r\nextreme peril and to connive at its loss of independence. He was\r\nprepared to obey this conviction at the cost of his own life, and\r\nthat sacrifice seemed a sufficient guarantee of his sincerity.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST FOREIGNERS\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded, too, that the nineteenth-century foreigner did\r\nnot present himself to Japan in a very lovable light. His demeanour\r\nwas marked by all the arrogance habitually shown by the Occidental\r\ntowards the Oriental, and though the general average of the oversea\r\ncomers reached a high standard, they approached the solution of all\r\nJapanese problems with a degree of suspicion which could not fail to\r\nbe intensely irksome to a proud nation. Even the foreign\r\nrepresentatives made it their habit to seek for trickery or abuse in\r\nall Japanese doings, official or private, and though they doubtless\r\nhad much warrant for this mood, its display did not tend to\r\nconciliate the Japanese. Many instances might be cited from the pages\r\nof official records and from the columns of local newspapers, but\r\nthey need not be detailed here.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there were difficulties connected with trade. The framers\r\nof the treaties had found it necessary to deal with the currency\r\nquestion, and their manner of dealing with it was to stipulate that\r\nforeign coins should be exchangeable with Japanese, weight for\r\nweight. This stipulation did not take into any account the ratio\r\nbetween the precious metals, and as that ratio was fifteen to one in\r\nEurope and five to one in Japan, it is obvious that, by the mere\r\nprocess of exchange, a foreign merchant could reap a rich harvest. Of\r\ncourse this was never intended by the framers of the treaty, and when\r\nthe Japanese saw the yellow metal flowing away rapidly from the\r\nrealm, they adopted the obvious expedient of changing the relative\r\nweights of the gold and silver coins.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether any state would have hesitated to apply\r\nthat remedy. Yet by the foreigner it was censured as a \"gross\r\nviolation of treaty right\" and as \"a deliberate attempt on the part\r\nof the Japanese authorities to raise all the prices of the native\r\nproduce two hundred per cent, against the foreign purchaser.\" The\r\nBritish representative, Sir Rutherford Alcock, in a despatch written\r\nto his Government, at the close of 1859, penned some very caustic\r\ncomments on the conduct of his countrymen, and did not hesitate to\r\ndeclare that \"in estimating the difficulties to be overcome in any\r\nattempt to improve the aspect of affairs, if the ill-disguised enmity\r\nof the governing classes and the indisposition of the Executive\r\nGovernment to give partial effect to the treaties be classed among\r\nthe first and principal of these, the unscrupulous character and\r\ndealings of foreigners who frequent the ports for purposes of trade\r\nare only second and scarcely inferior in importance, from the\r\nsinister character of the influence they exercise.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only just, however, to note the other side of the picture, and\r\nto observe that the foreign merchant had many causes of legitimate\r\ndissatisfaction; that his business was constantly hampered and\r\ninterrupted by Japanese official interference; that the ready\r\nrecourse which Japanese samurai had to deeds of blood against\r\npeaceful strangers seemed revoltingly cruel; that he appeared to be\r\nsurrounded by an atmosphere of perplexity and double dealing, and\r\nthat the large majority of the Anglo-Saxon tradesmen visiting Japan\r\nin the early days of her renewed intercourse had nothing whatever in\r\ncommon with the men described in the above despatch.\r\n\r\nKYOTO\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the sequence of events, it is necessary to revert\r\nto Kyoto, which, as the reader will have perceived, was the centre of\r\nnational politics in this troublous era. An incident apparently of\r\nthe greatest importance to the Bakufu occurred in 1861. The shogun\r\nreceived the Emperor's sister in marriage. But the auspicious event\r\nhad to be heavily paid for, since the Bakufu officials were obliged\r\nto pledge themselves to expel foreigners within ten years. This\r\ninspired new efforts on the part of the conservatives. A number of\r\nsamurai visited Yokohama, and promised death to any Japanese merchant\r\nentering into transactions with the aliens. These conservatives\r\nfurther announced the doctrine that the shogun's title of sei-i\r\n(barbarian-expelling) indicated explicitly that to expel foreigners\r\nwas his duty, and the shogun's principal officials were so craven\r\nthat they advised him to apologize for failing to discharge that duty\r\ninstead of wholly repudiating the extravagant interpretation of the\r\nanti-foreign party.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by these successes, the extremists in Kyoto induced the\r\nsovereign to issue an edict in which, after speaking of the\r\n\"insufferable and contumelious behaviour of foreigners,\" of \"the loss\r\nof prestige and of honour constantly menacing the country,\" and of\r\nthe sovereign's \"profound solicitude,\" his Majesty openly cited the\r\nshogun's engagement to drive out the aliens within ten years, and\r\nexplicitly affirmed that the grant of an Imperial princess' hand to\r\nthe shogun had been intended to secure the unity required for that\r\nachievement. Such an edict was in effect an exhortation to every\r\nJapanese subject to organize an anti-foreign crusade, and it\r\n\"publicly committed the Bakufu Court to a policy which the latter had\r\nneither the power to carry out nor any intention of attempting to\r\ncarry out.\"\r\n\r\nBut at this juncture something like a reaction took place in the\r\nImperial capital. A party of able men, led by Princes Konoe and\r\nIwakura, had the courage to denounce the unwisdom of the extremists,\r\nat whose head stood Princes Arisugawa and Sanjo. At that time the\r\nmost powerful fiefs in Japan were Satsuma and Choshu. Both were\r\nhereditarily hostile to the Tokugawa, but were mutually separated by\r\na difference of opinion in the matter of foreign policy, so that when\r\nthe above two cabals were organized in Kyoto, the Choshu men attached\r\nthemselves to the extremists, the Satsuma to the moderates. The\r\nlatter contrived to have an Imperial rescript sent to Yedo by the\r\nhands of the Satsuma feudatory, Shimazu Hisamitsu. This rescript\r\nindicated three courses, one of which the shogun was asked to choose:\r\nnamely, first, that he himself should proceed to Kyoto for the\r\npurpose of there conferring with the principal feudatories as to the\r\nbest means of tranquillizing the nation; secondly, that the five\r\nprincipal littoral fiefs should be ordered to prepare coast defences,\r\nand, thirdly, that Keiki of Mito and the feudatory of Echizen should\r\nbe appointed to high office in the Bakufu administration.\r\n\r\nTo obey this rescript was to violate the fundamental law of the\r\nBakufu, namely, that all interference in administrative affairs was\r\nforbidden to the Kyoto Court. The only dignified course for the\r\nshogun to take was to refuse compliance or to resign, and probably\r\nhad he done so he would have recovered the power of which he had\r\ngradually been deprived by the interference of Kyoto. But his\r\nadvisers lacked courage to recommend such a course. At their\r\nsuggestion the shogun signified his willingness to comply with the\r\nfirst and the third of the conditions embodied in the edict. The\r\nSatsuma feudatory strongly counselled that the shogun should decline\r\nto proceed to Kyoto and should reject all proposals for the expulsion\r\nof foreigners, but the Bakufu ignored his advice.\r\n\r\nTHE NAMAMUGI INCIDENT\r\n\r\nAt this time there occurred an incident which had the most\r\nfar-reaching consequences. A party of British subjects, three\r\ngentlemen and a lady, met, at Namamugi on the Tokaido, the cortege of\r\nthe Satsuma feudatory as he was returning from Yedo. Unacquainted\r\nwith the strict etiquette enforced in Japan in such situations, the\r\nforeigners attempted to ride through the procession, the result being\r\nthat one, Mr. Richardson, was killed, and two of the others were\r\nwounded. The upshot of this affair was that the British Government,\r\nhaving demanded the surrender of the samurai implicated in the\r\nmurder, and having been refused, sent a naval squadron to bombard\r\nKagoshima, the capital of the Satsuma baron. In this engagement, the\r\nSatsuma men learned for the first time the utter helplessness of\r\ntheir old weapons and old manner of fighting, and their conversion to\r\nprogressive ideas was thoroughly effected.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED INTRIGUES IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nThe submissive attitude of the Bakufu towards the Imperial Court\r\nencouraged the extremists in Kyoto to prefer fresh demands. Instead\r\nof waiting for the shogun to repair to Kyoto, as he had pledged\r\nhimself to do in compliance with the edict mentioned above, they\r\ncontrived the issue of another rescript, requiring the Bakufu to\r\nproclaim openly the adoption of the alien-expelling policy, and to\r\nfix a date for its practical inception. Again the Bakufu yielded.\r\nThey did not, indeed, actually take the steps indicated in the\r\nrescript, but they promised to consider its contents as soon as the\r\nshogun arrived in Kyoto. The extremists, however, could not reconcile\r\nthemselves to even that delay. In the spring of 1863, they\r\nconstrained Keiki, who had been appointed guardian to the shogun and\r\nwho was then in Kyoto, to give an engagement that on the shogun's\r\nreturn to Yedo decisive measures to put an end to foreign intercourse\r\nshould be begun. This engagement the shogun found awaiting him on his\r\narrival in the Imperial capital, and at the same time messages daily\r\nreached him from Yedo, declaring that unless he returned at once to\r\nYedo to settle the Namamugi affair, war with Great Britain would be\r\ninevitable. But the conservatives would not allow him to return. They\r\nprocured the issue of yet another Imperial decree directing that \"if\r\nthe English barbarians wanted a conference, they should repair to\r\nOsaka Harbour and receive a point-blank refusal; that the shogun\r\nshould remain in Kyoto to direct defensive operations, and that he\r\nshould accompany the Emperor to the shrine of the god of War where a\r\n'barbarian-quelling sword' would be handed to him.\" Illness saved the\r\nshogun from some of his perplexities and, in his absence, the Yedo\r\nstatesmen paid the indemnity required by Great Britain for the\r\nNamamugi outrage and left her to exact whatever further redress she\r\ndesired. Accordingly, in July, 1863, a British squadron proceeded to\r\nKagoshima and bombarded it as already described.\r\n\r\nTHE SHIMONOSEKI COMPLICATION\r\n\r\nIf the Satsuma men thus received a conclusive lesson as to the\r\nsuperiority of Western armaments, the Choshu fief was destined to be\r\nsimilarly instructed not long afterwards. It will have been perceived\r\nthat at this epoch the Imperial Court was very prolific in\r\nanti-foreign edicts. One of these actually appointed the 11th of May,\r\n1863, as the date for commencing the barbarian-expelling campaign,\r\nand copies of the edict were sent direct to the feudatories without\r\nprevious reference to the shogun. The Choshu daimyo found the edict\r\nso congenial that, without waiting for the appointed day, he opened\r\nfire on American, French, and Dutch merchantmen passing the Strait of\r\nShimonoseki, which his batteries commanded. The ships suffered no\r\ninjury, but, of course, such an act could not be condoned, and the\r\nBakufu Government being unwilling or unable to give full reparation,\r\nthe three powers whose vessels had been fired on joined hands with\r\nEngland for the purpose of despatching a squadron to destroy the\r\nChoshu forts, which result was attained with the greatest ease. This\r\n\"Shimonoseki Expedition,\" as it was called, enormously strengthened\r\nthe conviction which the bombardment of Kagoshima had established.\r\nThe nation thoroughly appreciated its own belligerent incapacity when\r\nforeign powers entered the lists, and patriotic men began to say\r\nunhesitatingly that their country was fatally weakened by the dual\r\nsystem of government.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF OPINION IN KYOTO\r\n\r\nThe sway exercised by the extremists in Kyoto now received a check\r\nowing to their excessive zeal. They procured the drafting of an\r\nImperial edict which declared the Emperor's resolve to drive out the\r\nforeigners, and announced a visit by his Majesty to the great shrines\r\nto pray for success. This edict never received the Imperial seal. The\r\nextremists appear to have overrated their influence at Court. They\r\ncounted erroneously on his Majesty's post facto compliance, and they\r\nthus created an opportunity of which the moderates took immediate\r\nadvantage. At the instance of the latter and in consideration of the\r\nfictitious edict, Mori Motonori of Choshu, leader of the extremists,\r\nwas ordered to leave the capital with all the nobles who shared his\r\nopinions. Doubtless the bombardment of Kagoshima contributed not a\r\nlittle to this measure, but the ostensible cause was the irregularity\r\nof the edict. There was no open disavowal of conservatism, but, on\r\nthe other hand, there was no attempt to enforce it. The situation for\r\nthe extremists was further impaired by an appeal to force on the part\r\nof the Choshu samurai. They essayed to enter Kyoto under arms, for\r\nthe ostensible purpose of presenting a petition to the Throne but\r\nreally to make away with the moderate leaders. This political coup\r\nfailed signally, and from that time the ardent advocates of the\r\nanti-foreign policy began to be regarded as rebels. Just at this time\r\nthe Shimonoseki expedition gave an object lesson to the nation, and\r\nhelped to deprive the barbarian-expelling agitation of any semblance\r\nof Imperial sanction.\r\n\r\nCHOSHU AND THE BAKUFU\r\n\r\nWhen the Choshu feudatory attempted to close the Shimonoseki Strait\r\nby means of cannon, the Bakufu sent a commissioner to remonstrate.\r\nBut the Choshu samurai insisted that they had merely obeyed the\r\nsovereign's order, and the better to demonstrate their resolution,\r\nthey put the commissioner to death. Thus directly challenged, the\r\nBakufu mustered a powerful force and launched it against Choshu. But\r\nby this time the two great southern clans, having learned the madness\r\nof appealing to force for the purpose of keeping the country closed,\r\nhad agreed to work together in the interests of the State. Thus, when\r\nthe Bakufu army, comprising contingents from thirty-six feudatories,\r\nreached Choshu, the latter appealed to the clemency of the invading\r\ngenerals, among whom the Satsuma baron was the most powerful, and the\r\nappeal resulted in the withdrawal of the punitory expedition without\r\nthe imposition of any conditions. The Bakufu were naturally much\r\nincensed. Another formidable force was organized to attack Choshu,\r\nbut it halted at Osaka and sent envoys to announce the punishment of\r\nthe rebellious fief, to which announcements the fief paid not the\r\nleast attention.\r\n\r\nTHE HYOGO DEMONSTRATION\r\n\r\nWhile things were at this stage, Sir Harry Parkes, representative of\r\nGreat Britain, arrived upon the scene in the Far East. A man of\r\nremarkably luminous judgment and military methods, this distinguished\r\ndiplomatist appreciated almost immediately that the ratification of\r\nthe treaties by the sovereign was essential to their validity, and\r\nthat by investing the ratification with all possible formality, the\r\nEmperor's recovery of administrative power might be accelerated. He\r\ntherefore conceived the idea of repairing to Hyogo with a powerful\r\nnaval squadron for the purpose of seeking, first, the ratification of\r\nthe treaty; secondly, the reduction of the import tariff from an\r\naverage of fifteen per cent, ad valorem (at which figure it had been\r\nfixed by the original treaty) to five per cent., and, thirdly, the\r\nopening of the ports of Hyogo and Osaka at once, instead of nearly\r\ntwo years hence, as previously agreed.\r\n\r\nAmong the penalties imposed upon Choshu by the four powers which\r\ncombined to destroy the forts at Shimonoseki was a fine of three\r\nmillion dollars, and the Bakufu, being unable to collect this money\r\nfrom Choshu, had taken upon themselves the duty of paying it and had\r\nalready paid one million. Sir Harry Parkes's plan was to remit the\r\nremaining two millions in consideration of the Government endorsing\r\nthe three demands formulated above. It need hardly be said that the\r\nappearance of a powerful squadron of foreign warships at the very\r\nportals of the Imperial palace threw the nation into a ferment. The\r\neight vessels cast anchor off Hyogo in November, 1866, and it seemed\r\nto the nation that the problem of foreign intercourse had been\r\nrevived in an aggravated form.\r\n\r\nOnce again the anti-foreign agitators recovered their influence, and\r\ninveighed against the Bakufu's incompetence to avert such trespasses\r\neven from the sacred city. Under the pressure brought to bear by\r\nthese conservatives, the Emperor dismissed from office or otherwise\r\npunished the ministers appointed by the shogun to negotiate with the\r\nforeign representatives, and in the face of this humiliating\r\ndisavowal of Bakufu authority, the shogun had no alternative except\r\nto resign. He did so. But the Imperial Court hesitated to accept the\r\nresponsibilities that would have resulted from sanctioning his\r\nresignation. The Bakufu were informed that the Emperor sanctioned the\r\ntreaties and that the shogun was authorized to deal with them, but\r\nthat steps must be taken to revise them in consultation with the\r\nfeudatories, and that Hyogo and Osaka must not be opened, though the\r\nproposed change of tariff-rate would be permitted. Nothing definite\r\nwas said about remitting the two million dollars remaining from the\r\nChoshu fine, and Sir Harry Parkes was able to say triumphantly that\r\nhe had obtained two out of three concessions demanded by him without\r\nhaving given any quid pro whatever.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE TOKUGAWA SHOGUNS\r\n\r\nThe measures against Choshu were now recommenced, but with complete\r\nunsuccess, and thus a final blow was given to the prestige of the\r\nYedo Government. It was at this time (1866) that the fourteenth\r\nshogun, Iemochi, passed away and was succeeded by Yoshinobu, better\r\nknown, as Keiki. Whatever the political views of this nobleman may\r\nhave been when he was put forward by the conservatives, in 1857, as a\r\ncandidate for succession to the shogunate, he no sooner attained that\r\ndignity, in 1866, than he became an ardent advocate of progress.\r\nFrench experts were engaged to remodel the army, and English officers\r\nto organize the navy; the shogun's brother was sent to the Paris\r\nExposition, and Occidental fashions were introduced at the ceremonies\r\nof the Bakufu Court.\r\n\r\nSATSUMA AND CHOSHU\r\n\r\nWhen Keiki assumed office he had to deal speedily with two problems;\r\nthat is to say, the complication with Choshu, and the opening of\r\nHyogo. The Emperor's reluctant consent to the latter was obtained for\r\nthe beginning of 1868, and an edict was also issued for the\r\npunishment of Choshu. The result was two-fold: fresh life was\r\nimparted to the anti-foreign agitation, and the Satsuma and Choshu\r\nfeudatories were induced to join hands against the Tokugawa. Alike in\r\nSatsuma and in Choshu, there were a number of clever men who had long\r\nlaboured to combine the forces of the two fiefs in order to unite the\r\nwhole empire under the sway of the Kyoto Court. Saigo and Okubo on\r\nthe Satsuma side, Kido and Sanjo on the Choshu became leading figures\r\non the stage of their country's new career. Through their influence,\r\naided by that of Ito, afterwards prince, and Inouye, afterwards\r\nmarquis, the two great clans were brought into alliance, and when, in\r\n1867, the shogun, Keiki, sought and obtained Imperial sanction for\r\nthe punishment of Choshu, Satsuma agreed to enter the lists on the\r\nlatter's side.\r\n\r\nTOSA MEMORIAL\r\n\r\nAn incident of a most striking and unexpected nature now occurred.\r\nYodo, the Tosa feudatory, addressed to the shogun a memorial exposing\r\nthe helpless condition of the Bakufu and strongly urging that the\r\nadministration should be restored to the Emperor in order that the\r\nnation might be united to face the dangers of its new career. It is\r\nnecessary to note here that, although the feudatories have been\r\nfrequently referred to in these pages as prominent figures in this or\r\nthat public drama, the feudal chiefs themselves exercised, in\r\nTokugawa days, very little influence on the current of events. A\r\nmodern historian speaks justly when he says:\r\n\r\n\"In this respect the descendants of the great Tokugawa statesman\r\nfound themselves reduced to a position precisely analogous to that of\r\nthe emperor in Kyoto. Sovereign and shogun were alike mere\r\nabstractions so far as the practical work of the government was\r\nconcerned. With the great mass of the feudal chiefs things fared\r\nsimilarly. These men who, in the days of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and\r\nIeyasu, had directed the policies of their fiefs and led their armies\r\nin the field, were gradually transformed, during the lone peace of\r\nthe Tokugawa era, into voluptuous fainéants or, at best, thoughtless\r\ndilettanti, willing to abandon the direction of their affairs to\r\nseneschals and mayors, who, while on the whole their administration\r\nwas able and loyal, found their account in contriving and\r\nperpetuating the effacement of their chiefs. Thus, in effect, the\r\ngovernment of the country, taken out of the hands of the shogun and\r\nthe feudatories, fell into those of their vassals. There were\r\nexceptions, of course, but so rare as to be mere accidental. . . The\r\nrevolution which involved the fall of the shogunate, and ultimately\r\nof feudalism, may be called democratic with regard to the personnel\r\nof those who planned and directed it. They were, for the most part,\r\nmen without either rank or social standing.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition; article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nKeiki himself, although the memorial was directed against him, may\r\nfairly be reckoned among these longsighted patriots. The Tosa\r\nmemorial appealed so forcibly to the convictions he entertained that\r\nhe at once summoned a council of all feudatories and high officials\r\nthen in Kyoto; informed them of his resolve to adopt the advice of\r\nthe memorialist, and, on the following day, handed in his resignation\r\nto the Emperor. This memorable event took place on the 14th of\r\nOctober, 1867; and the answer of the Emperor before the assembly of\r\nDecember 15th marked the end of the shogunate.\r\n\r\nTHE 122ND SOVEREIGN, THE EMPEROR MUTSUHITO (A.D. 1867-1912)\r\n\r\nThe throne was occupied at this time by Mutsuhito, who had succeeded\r\non the 13th of February, 1867, at the death of his father, Komei, and\r\nwho himself died on the 29th day of July 1912. At the time of his\r\naccession, the new monarch was in his fifteenth year, having been\r\nborn on the 3rd of November, 1852.\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESIGNATION\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Keiki's resignation was presented in all good faith. It\r\ndeserves to rank among the most memorable incidents of the world's\r\nhistory, for such a sacrifice has seldom been made by any ruler in\r\nthe interests of his nation. But by the Satsuma and Choshu\r\nfeudatories, the sincerity of the shogun was not recognized. Through\r\ntheir influence the youthful Emperor was induced to issue an edict\r\ncalling Keiki a traitor, accusing him of arrogance and disloyalty,\r\ndeclaring that he had not hesitated to violate the commands of the\r\nlate Emperor, and directing that he should be destroyed. In obedience\r\nto this rescript the Tokugawa officials were treated with such\r\nharshness that Keiki found it impossible to calm their indignation;\r\nit culminated in an abortive attack upon Kyoto. Thereupon, Keiki\r\nretired to Yedo, which city he subsequently surrendered\r\nunconditionally. But all his former adherents did not show themselves\r\nequally placable. An attempt was made to set up a rival candidate for\r\nthe throne in the person of the Imperial lord-abbot of the Ueno\r\nmonastery in Yedo; the Aizu clan made a gallant and unsuccessful\r\nresistance in the northern provinces, and the shogun's admiral,\r\nYenomoto (afterwards viscount), essayed to establish a republic in\r\nYezo, whither he had retired with the Tokugawa warships. But these\r\npetty incidents were altogether insignificant compared with the great\r\nevent of which they were a sequel.\r\n\r\nTHE MEIJI GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nThe year-name was now changed to Meiji (Enlightened Government), from\r\nJanuary 1, 1868, a term fully justified by events. One of the\r\nearliest acts of the new Government was to invite the foreign\r\nrepresentatives to the Imperial city, where the Emperor himself\r\nreceived them in audience, an act of extreme condescension according\r\nto Japanese canons of etiquette. Thereafter, an Imperial decree\r\nannounced the sovereign's determination to cement amicable relations\r\nwith foreign nations, and declared that any Japanese subject guilty\r\nof violence to a foreigner would be acting in contravention of his\r\nsovereign's commands, as well as injuriously to the dignity and good\r\nfaith of the country in the eyes of the powers with which his Majesty\r\nhad pledged himself to maintain friendship. So signal was the change\r\nthat had taken place in the demeanour of the nation's leaders towards\r\nforeign intercourse! Only two years earlier, the advent of a squadron\r\nof foreign war-vessels at Hyogo had created almost a panic and had\r\ncaused men to cry out that the precincts of the sacred city of Kyoto\r\nwere in danger of desecration by barbarian feet. But now the Emperor\r\ninvited the once hated aliens to his presence, treated them with the\r\nutmost courtesy, and publicly greeted them as welcome guests. Such a\r\nmetamorphosis has greatly perplexed some students of Japanese\r\nhistory. Yet the explanation is simple. The Kagoshima and Shimonoseki\r\nexpeditions had taught Japan that she was powerless in the face of\r\nWestern armaments; she had learned that national effacement must be\r\nthe sequel of seclusion, and, above all, she had come to an\r\nunderstanding that her divided form of government paralyzed her for\r\npurposes of resistance to aggression from abroad.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: STONE AND WOODEN LANTERNS ERECTED IN FRONT OF SHRINES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nTHE MEIJI GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nTHE LEADERS OF REFORM\r\n\r\nIN describing the events that culminated in the fall of the Tokugawa,\r\nfrequent references have been made to the feudatories. But it should\r\nbe clearly understood that the feudal chiefs themselves had very\r\nlittle to do with the consummation of this great change. \"The men\r\nthat conceived and achieved the Revolution of 1867, were chiefly\r\nsamurai of inferior grade.\" They numbered fifty-five in all, and of\r\nthese only thirteen were aristocrats, namely, five feudal barons and\r\neight court nobles. The average age of these fifty-five did not\r\nexceed thirty years.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR'S OATH\r\n\r\nThe great clans which took part in bringing about this restoration of\r\nthe administrative power to the Emperor did not altogether trust one\r\nanother. Hitherto, all political commotions had been planned for the\r\nsake of some prominent family or eminent leader, and had resulted\r\nmerely in altering the personnel of those occupying the seats of\r\npower. It was not unnatural that history should have been expected to\r\nrepeat itself in 1867, especially since the clan mainly responsible,\r\nSatsuma, overshadowed all its associates with one exception.\r\nTherefore, to many onlookers it seemed that the Tokugawa Government\r\nhad been overthrown to make room for the all-powerful southern\r\nfeudatory. In order to provide a safeguard against such a danger, the\r\nyoung Emperor was asked to make oath that a broadly based\r\ndeliberative assembly should be convened for the purpose of\r\nconducting State affairs in conformity with public opinion. This\r\n\"coronation oath,\" as it was subsequently called, came to occupy an\r\nimportant place in political appreciation, and to be interpreted as a\r\npromise of a national assembly. But most assuredly it was not\r\noriginally intended to carry any such meaning. Its framers never\r\ncontemplated a parliament in the Occidental sense of the term. Their\r\nsole object was to place a barrier in the path of their own selfish\r\nambitions.\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF FEUDALISM\r\n\r\nIt is more than doubtful whether the abolition of the feudal system\r\nfound a place in the original plan of the leaders of progress.\r\nLooking back to remote centuries, they may well have imagined that\r\nthe unification of the empire under one supreme ruler, administering\r\nas well as governing, was not incompatible with the existence of the\r\nfiefs. But when they examined the problem more closely, they\r\nrecognized that a universally operative system of laws, a central\r\ntreasury, and the supreme command of the nation's armaments were\r\nessential to the end they had in view, namely, strength derived from\r\nunity. Hitherto, each feudatory had assessed and collected taxes\r\nwithin his fief according to his own free-will, had exercised the\r\nright of legislation, and had held the command of all troops within\r\nhis territories.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of such conditions would have defeated the purpose of\r\nthe reformers. This they recognized. But how were these prescriptive\r\nprivileges to be abolished? An Imperial mandate might indeed have\r\nbeen issued, but even an Imperial mandate without the means of\r\nenforcing it would probably have proved futile. In fact, compulsion\r\nin any form could not be employed: the only resource was persuasion.\r\nThe feudatories of Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, and Hizen were the four\r\nmost puissant in the empire. They were persuaded to surrender their\r\nfiefs to the Throne and to ask for reorganization under a uniform\r\nsystem of law. This example found many imitators. Out of the whole\r\n276 feudatories only seventeen failed to make a similar surrender. It\r\nwas a wonderful display of patriotic altruism in the case of some, at\r\nany rate, of the daimyo. But, at the same time, many undoubtedly\r\nobeyed the suggestions of their chief vassals without fully\r\nappreciating the cost of obedience. It had long been their habit to\r\nabandon the management of their affairs to seneschals (karo), and\r\nthey followed the custom on this occasion without profound\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nWith the samurai at large, however, the case was different. For them,\r\nthe preservation of the fief had always been the prime object of\r\ninterest and fealty. To uphold it concerned their honour; to preserve\r\nit, their means of livelihood. Nothing could have been more\r\nremarkable than that these men should have quietly acquiesced in the\r\nsurrender of legislative and financial autonomy by their chiefs. The\r\nmost credible explanation is that on this great occasion the samurai\r\nobeyed their habitual custom of associating some form of\r\nself-immolation with every signal deed.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe total abolition of feudalism may be said to have now come in\r\nsight, but the leading progressists adopted all precautions to\r\nconsummate their programme without disturbance. They resolved to\r\npreserve, at the outset, the semblance of the old system, and to that\r\nend the ex-feudatories were nominated to the post of governor in the\r\ndistricts where they had formerly exercised autonomic power. The\r\nsamurai, however, were left in possession of their incomes and\r\nofficial positions. It was enacted that each governor should receive\r\nyearly one-tenth of the revenue of his former fief; that the\r\nemoluments of the samurai should be taken in full from the same\r\nsource, and that the surplus, if any, should go to the Central\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe latter was organized with seven departments, namely, Religion,\r\nHome Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Army and Navy, Finance, Justice, and\r\nLaw. This Cabinet was presided over by a premier--necessarily an\r\nImperial prince--and by a vice-premier. Moreover, it was assisted by\r\na body of eighteen councillors, who comprised the leaders of reform.\r\nEvidently, however, all this was only partial. It is true that the\r\nfiefs (hari) had been converted into prefectures (ken), and it is\r\nalso true that the daimyo had become mere governors. But, on the\r\nother hand, the local revenues continued to pass through the hands of\r\nthe governors, and in the same hands remained the control of the\r\nsamurai and the right of appointing and dismissing prefectural\r\nofficials. A substantial beginning had been made, however, and\r\npresently another appeal being addressed to the ex-daimyo, they were\r\ninduced to petition for the surrender of their local autonomy. The\r\nsame plan was pursued in the case of the samurai. It was essential\r\nthat these should cease to be hereditary soldiers and officials and\r\nshould be reabsorbed into the mass of the people from whom they had\r\nsprung originally. Following the course which had proved so\r\nsuccessful with the feudatories, a number of samurai were induced to\r\nmemorialize for permission to lay aside their swords and revert to\r\nagriculture. But neither in the case of the feudatories nor in that\r\nof the samurai were these self-sacrificing petitions carried into\r\nimmediate practice. They merely served as models.\r\n\r\nCLAN REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that the ambitions of the great clans by\r\nwhich this revolution has been effected proved somewhat difficult\r\nto reconcile. The Satsuma feudatory was the first to take umbrage.\r\nHe contended that, in selecting the high officials of the new\r\norganization, sufficient account had not been taken of the services\r\nof his fief. With considerable difficulty he was satisfied by his\r\nown appointment to an office second only to that of prime minister.\r\nThis incident led, however, to an agreement under which each of\r\nthe great clans, Satsuma, Choshu, Hizen, and Tosa, should be\r\nequally represented in the Government. Thus, the \"principle\r\nof clan-representation received practical recognition in the\r\norganization of the Government. It continued to be recognized for\r\nmany years, and ultimately became the chief target of attack by\r\nparty-politicians.\" It was further arranged, at this time, that each\r\nof the above four clans should furnish a contingent of troops to\r\nguard the sovereign's person and to form the nucleus of a national\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY\r\n\r\nIt being now considered safe to advance to the next stage of the\r\nmediatization of the fiefs, the Emperor issued an edict abolishing\r\nlocal autonomy; removing the sometime daimyo from their post of\r\nprefectural governor; providing that the local revenues should\r\nthereafter be sent into the central treasury; declaring the\r\nappointment and dismissal of officials to be among the prerogatives\r\nof the Imperial Government; directing that the ex-feudatories should\r\ncontinue to receive one-tenth of their former incomes but that they\r\nshould make Tokyo* their place of permanent residence, and ordaining\r\nthat the samurai should be left in continued and undisturbed\r\npossession of all their hereditary pensions and allowances.\r\n\r\n*Yedo was now called Tokyo, or \"Eastern Capital;\" and Kyoto was named\r\nSaikyo, or \"Western Capital.\"\r\n\r\nThese changes were not so momentous as might be supposed at first\r\nsight. It is true that the ex-feudatories were reduced to the\r\nposition of private gentlemen without even a patent of nobility. But,\r\nas a matter of fact, the substance of administrative power had never\r\nbeen possessed by them: it had been left in most cases to their\r\nseneschals. Thus, the loss of what they had never fully enjoyed did\r\nnot greatly distress them. Moreover, they were left in possession of\r\nthe accumulated funds of their former fiefs, and, at the same time,\r\nan income of one-tenth of their feudal revenues was guaranteed to\r\nthem--a sum which generally exceeded their former incomes when from\r\nthe latter had been deducted all charges on account of the\r\nmaintenance of the fiefs. Therefore, the sacrifice they were required\r\nto make was not so bitter after all, but that it was a very\r\nsubstantial sacrifice there can be no question.\r\n\r\nTHE SAMURAI'S POSITION\r\n\r\nThe above edict was promulgated on August 29, 1871; that is to say,\r\nnearly four years after the fall of the Tokugawa. The samurai,\r\nhowever, remained to be dealt with. Feudalism could not be said to\r\nhave been abolished so long as the samurai continued to be a class\r\napart. These men numbered four hundred thousand and with their\r\nfamilies represented a total of about two million souls. They were\r\nthe empire's soldiers, and in return for devoting their lives to\r\nmilitary service they held incomes, some for life, others hereditary,\r\nand these emoluments aggregated two millions sterling annually. No\r\nreformer, however radical, would have suggested the sudden\r\ndisestablishment of the samurai system or advocated the wholesale\r\ndeprivation of incomes won by their forefathers as a reward for loyal\r\nservice to the State or to the fiefs.\r\n\r\nThe Government dealt with this problem much as it had done with the\r\nproblem of the feudatories. In 1873, an Imperial decree announced\r\nthat the treasury was ready to commute the samurai's incomes on the\r\nbasis of six-years' purchase in the place of hereditary pensions and\r\nfour years for life-pensions, half of the money to be paid in cash\r\nand the remainder in bonds carrying eight per cent, interest. This\r\nmeasure was in no sense compulsory; the samurai were free to accept\r\nor reject it. Not a few chose the former course, but a large majority\r\ncontinued to wear their swords and draw their pensions as of old. The\r\nGovernment, however, felt that there could be no paltering with the\r\nsituation. Shortly after the issue of the above edict a conscription\r\nlaw was enacted, by which every adult male became liable for military\r\nservice, whatever his social status. Naturally, this law shocked the\r\nsamurai. The heavy diminution of their incomes hurt them less,\r\nperhaps, than the necessity of laying aside their swords and of\r\ngiving up their traditional title to represent their country in arms.\r\nThey had imagined that service in the army and navy would be reserved\r\nexclusively for them and their sons, whereas by the conscription law\r\nthe commonest unit of the people became equally eligible.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: KIDO KOIN\r\n\r\nFRICTION AMONG THE LEADERS OF REFORM\r\n\r\nIt could not have: been expected that this manner of treating the\r\nsamurai would obtain universal approval. Already, too, the strain of\r\nconstructive statesmanship had developed friction among the\r\nprogressist leaders who had easily marched abreast for destructive\r\npurposes. They differed about the subject of a national assembly,\r\nsome being inclined to attach more practical importance than others\r\nto the Emperor's coronation oath that a broadly based deliberative\r\nassembly should be convened. A small number of zealous reformers\r\nwished to regard this as a promise of a national assembly, but the\r\ngreat majority of the progressist leaders interpreted it merely as a\r\nguarantee against the undue preponderance of any one clan. In fact,\r\naccording to the view of the latter party the broadly based\r\ndeliberative assembly was regarded solely as an instrument for\r\neliciting the views of the samurai, and entirely without legislative\r\npower. Such an assembly was actually convened in the early years of\r\nthe Meiji era, but its second session proved it to be nothing more\r\nthan a debating club and it was suffered to lapse out of existence.\r\n\r\nA more perplexing problem now (1873) presented itself, however. The\r\nKorean Court deliberately abandoned the custom followed by it since\r\nthe time of Hideyoshi's invasion--the custom of sending a\r\npresent-bearing embassy to felicitate the accession of each shogun.\r\nMoreover, this step was accompanied by an offensive despatch\r\nannouncing a determination to cease all relations with a renegade\r\nfrom the civilization of the Orient. It may well be imagined how\r\nindignantly this attitude of the neighbouring kingdom was resented by\r\nJapan. The prominent leaders of national reform at that time were\r\nSanjo and Iwakura, originally Court nobles;* Saigo and Okubo, samurai\r\nof Satsuma, and Kido, a samurai of Choshu. In the second rank were\r\nseveral men destined afterwards to attain great celebrity--the late\r\nPrince Ito, Marquis Inouye, Count Okuma, Count Itagaki--often spoken\r\nof as the \"Rousseau of Japan\"--and several others.\r\n\r\n*The distinction between Court nobles and territorial nobles had been\r\nabolished in 1871.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SANJO SANETOMI\r\n\r\nThe first five, however, were pre-eminent at the moment when Korea\r\nsent her offensive message. They were not, however, absolutely united\r\nas to policy. Saigo Takamori held some conservative opinions, the\r\nchief of which was that he wished to preserve the military class in\r\ntheir old position of the empire's only soldiers. He had, therefore,\r\ngreatly resented the conscription law, and while his discontent was\r\nstill fresh, the Korean problem presented itself for solution. In\r\nSaigo's eyes an oversea war offered the only chance of saving the\r\nsamurai, since the conscription law had not yet produced any\r\ntrustworthy soldiers. He therefore voted to draw the sword at once,\r\nand in this he obtained the support of several influential men who\r\nburned to avenge the nation's disgrace. On the other hand, those in\r\nfavour of peace insisted that the country must not venture to engage\r\nin a foreign war during the era of radical transition.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was carried to the Emperor's presence; the peace-party\r\nprevailed, and Saigo with three other Cabinet ministers resigned. One\r\nof the seceders, Eto Shimpei, had recourse to arms, but was speedily\r\ncrushed. Another, Itagaki Taisuke, from that moment stood forth as\r\nthe champion of representative institutions. The third, the most\r\nprominent of all, Saigo Takamori, retired to Satsuma and devoted\r\nhimself to organizing and equipping a strong body of samurai. It is\r\nnot by any means clear that, in thus acting, Saigo had any\r\nrevolutionary intention. Posterity agrees in thinking that he sought\r\nto exercise control rather than to inspire revolt. He had the support\r\nof Shimazu Saburo (Hisamitsu), former feudatory of Satsuma, who,\r\nalthough a reformer, resented a wholesale abandonment of Japanese\r\ncustoms in favour of foreign. The province of Satsuma thus became a\r\nseed-plot of conservative influences, where \"Saigo and his constantly\r\naugmenting band of samurai found a congenial environment.\" On the one\r\nhand, the Central Government steadily proceeded with the organization\r\nof a conscript army, teaching it foreign tactics and equipping it\r\nwith foreign arms. On the other, the southern clan cherished its band\r\nof samurai, arming them with the rifle and drilling them in the\r\nmanner of Europe, but leaving them always in possession of the\r\nsamurai's sword.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: IWAKURA TOMOYOSHI\r\n\r\nTHE FORMOSAN EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nBefore these curious conditions bore any practical fruit, Japan found\r\nit necessary to send a military expedition to Formosa. That island\r\nwas claimed as part of China's domains, but it was not administered\r\nby her effectively, and its inhabitants showed great barbarity in\r\ntheir treatment of castaways from the Ryukyu, or Loochoo, Islands.\r\nThe Chinese Government's plain function was to punish these acts of\r\ncruelty, but as the Peking statesmen showed no disposition to\r\ndischarge their duty in that respect, Japan took the law into her own\r\nhands. A double purpose was thus served. For the expedition to\r\nFormosa furnished employment for the Satsuma samurai, and, at the\r\nsame time, assured the Ryukyu islanders that Japan was prepared to\r\nprotect them.\r\n\r\nThe campaign in Formosa proved a very tame affair. It amounted to the\r\nshooting-down of a few semi-savages. No attempt was made to penetrate\r\ninto the ulterior of the island, where, as modern experience shows,\r\nmany great difficulties would have had to be overcome. Peking took\r\nserious umbrage on account of Japan's high-handed conduct--for such\r\nit seemed to Chinese eyes. In the first place, the statesmen of the\r\nMiddle Kingdom contended that the Ryukyu Islands could not properly\r\nbe regarded as an integral part of the Japanese empire; and in the\r\nsecond place, they claimed that, in attacking Formosa, Japan had\r\ninvaded Chinese territory. After a long interchange of despatches the\r\nTokyo Government sent an ambassador to Peking, and a peaceful\r\nsolution was found in the payment by China of a small indemnity, and\r\nthe recognition of Formosa as a part of the Middle Kingdom.*\r\n\r\n*The indemnity amounted to 500,000 dollars (Mexican).\r\n\r\nTHE KOREAN QUESTION AGAIN\r\n\r\nThe Formosan expedition took place in 1874, and, in the fall of 1875,\r\na Korean fort opened fire on a Japanese warship which was engaged in\r\nsurveying the coast. Such an insult could not be tamely endured.\r\nJapan marshalled an imposing number of warships and transports, but,\r\nfollowing the example set in her own case by Commodore Perry, she\r\nemployed this flotilla to intimidate Korea into signing a treaty of\r\namity and commerce and opening certain ports to foreign trade. Thus,\r\nKorea was drawn from her hereditary isolation, and to Japan fell the\r\ncredit of having become an instrument for extending the principle of\r\nuniversal intercourse which she had herself so stoutly opposed during\r\ntwo and a half centuries. It was a clever coup, but it earned little\r\ncredit with the samurai. They regarded such a settlement as\r\nderogatory to their country.\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF THE SAMURAI\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that the Tokyo Government felt itself strong\r\nenough to resort to conclusive measures in the cases of the samurai.\r\nThree years had now passed since the wearing of swords had been\r\ndeclared optional and since a scheme for the voluntary commutation of\r\nthe samurai's pensions had been elaborated. The leaders of progress\r\nfelt that the time had now come to make these measures compulsory,\r\nand, accordingly, two edicts were issued in that sense. The edicts,\r\nespecially their financial provisions, imposed a heavy sacrifice. But\r\nit is very noticeable that the momentary question evoked no protests.\r\nIt was to the loss of their swords that a number of samurai objected\r\nstrenuously. Some scores of them, wearing old-fashioned armour and\r\nequipped with hereditary weapons, attacked a castle, killed or\r\nwounded three hundred of the garrison, and then died by their own\r\nhands. Here and there throughout the empire a few equally vain\r\nprotests were raised, and finally the Satsuma samurai took the field.\r\n\r\nTHE SATSUMA REBELLION\r\n\r\nThis insurrection in the south severely taxed the resources of the\r\nCentral Government. The Satsuma samurai were led by Saigo Takamori,\r\nbut it has always been claimed for him that he undertook the command,\r\nnot for the purpose of overthrowing the Meiji Government, but in the\r\nhope of restraining his followers. Ultimately, however, he seems to\r\nhave been swept away by the tide of their enthusiasm. The insurgents\r\nnumbered some forty thousand; they all belonged to the samurai class,\r\nwere fully trained in Occidental tactics, and were equipped with\r\nrifles and field-guns. Their avowed purpose was to restore the\r\nmilitary class to its old position, and to insure to it all the posts\r\nin the army and the navy.\r\n\r\nFighting began on January 29, 1877, and ended on September 24th of\r\nthe same year. All the rebel leaders fell in battle or died by their\r\nown hands. During these eight months of warfare, the Government put\r\nsixty-six thousand men into the field, and the casualties on both\r\nsides totalled thirty-five thousand, or thirty-three per cent, of the\r\nwhole. Apart from the great issue directly at stake, namely, whether\r\nJapan should have a permanent military class, a secondary problem of\r\nmuch interest found a solution in the result. It was the problem\r\nwhether an army of conscripts, supposed to be lacking in the fighting\r\ninstinct and believed to be incapable of standing up to do battle\r\nwith the samurai, could hold its own against the flower of the bushi,\r\nas the Satsuma men undoubtedly were. There really never was any\r\nsubstantial reason for doubt about such a subject. The samurai were\r\nnot racially distinct from the bulk of the nation. They had\r\noriginally been mere farmers, possessing no special military\r\naptitude. Nevertheless, among all the reforms introduced during the\r\nMeiji era, none was counted so hazardous as the substitution of a\r\nconscript army for the nation's traditional soldiers. The Satsuma\r\nrebellion disposed finally of the question.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SAIGO TAKAMORI\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF THE NATION\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Government had been strenuously seeking to equip the\r\npeople with the products of Western civilization. It has been shown\r\nthat the men who sat in the seats of power during the first decade of\r\nthe Meiji era owed their exalted position to their own intellectual\r\nsuperiority and far-seeing statesmanship. That such men should become\r\nthe nation's teachers would have been natural anywhere. But in Japan\r\nthere was a special reason for the people's need of official\r\nguidance. It had become a traditional habit of the Japanese to look\r\nto officialdom for example and direction in everything, and this\r\nhabit naturally asserted itself with special force when there was\r\nquestion of assimilating a foreign civilization which for nearly\r\nthree centuries had been an object of national repugnance. The\r\nGovernment, in short, had to inspire the reform movement and, at the\r\nsame time, to furnish models of its working.\r\n\r\nThe task was approached with wholesale energy by those in power. In\r\ngeneral the direction of the work was divided among foreigners of\r\ndifferent nations. Frenchmen were employed in revising the criminal\r\ncode and in teaching strategy and tactics to the Japanese army. The\r\nbuilding of railways, the installation of telegraphs and of\r\nlighthouses, and the new navy were turned over to English engineers\r\nand sailors. Americans were employed in the formation of a postal\r\nservice, in agricultural reforms, and in planning colonization and an\r\neducational system. In an attempt to introduce Occidental ideas of\r\nart Italian sculptors and painters were brought to Japan. And German\r\nexperts were asked to develop a system of local government, to train\r\nJapanese physicians, and to educate army officers. Great misgivings\r\nwere expressed by foreign onlookers at this juncture. They found it\r\nimpossible to believe that such wholesale adoption of an alien\r\ncivilization could not be attended with due eclecticism, and they\r\nconstantly predicted a violent reaction. But all these pessimistic\r\nviews were contradicted by results. There was no reaction, and the\r\nmemory of the apprehensions then freely uttered finds nothing but\r\nridicule to-day.\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nOne of the chief difficulties with which the Meiji statesmen had to\r\ncontend was finance. When they took over the treasury from the Bakufu\r\nthere were absolutely no funds in hand, and for some years, as has\r\nbeen shown above, all the revenues of the former fiefs were locally\r\nexpended, no part of them, except a doubtful surplus, finding its way\r\nto the Imperial treasury. The only resource was an issue of paper\r\nmoney. Such tokens of exchange had been freely employed since the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, and at the time of the\r\nmediatization of the fiefs, 1694 kinds of notes were in circulation.\r\n\r\nThe first business of the Government should have been to replace\r\nthese unsecured tokens with uniform and sound media of exchange. But\r\ninstead of performing that duty the Meiji statesmen saw themselves\r\ncompelled to follow the evil example set by the fiefs in past times.\r\nGovernment notes were issued. They fell at the outset to a discount\r\nof fifty per cent, and various devices, more or less despotic, were\r\nemployed to compel their circulation at par. By degrees, however, the\r\nGovernment's credit improved, and thus, though the issues of\r\ninconvertible notes aggregated sixty million yen at the close of the\r\nfirst five years of the Meiji era, they passed freely from hand to\r\nhand without discount. But, of course, the need for funds in\r\nconnexion with the wholesale reforms and numerous enterprises\r\ninaugurated officially became more and more pressing, so that in the\r\nfourteenth year (1881) after the Restoration, the face value of the\r\nnotes in circulation aggregated 180 million yen, and they stood at a\r\nheavy discount.\r\n\r\nThe Government, after various tentative and futile efforts to correct\r\nthis state of depreciation, set themselves to deal radically with the\r\nproblem. Chiefly by buying exporters' bills and further by reducing\r\nadministrative expenditures as well as by taxing alcohol, a\r\nsubstantial specie reserve was gradually accumulated, and, by 1885,\r\nthe volume of fiduciary notes having been reduced to 119 millions,\r\nwhereas the treasury vaults contained forty-five millions of precious\r\nmetals, the resumption of specie payments was announced. As for the\r\nnational debt, it had its origin in the commutation of the\r\nfeudatories' incomes and the samurai's pensions. A small fraction of\r\nthese outlays was defrayed with ready money, but the great part took\r\nthe form of public loan-bonds. These bonds constituted the bulk of\r\nthe State's liabilities during the first half-cycle of the Meiji era,\r\nand when we add the debts of the fiefs, which the Central Government\r\ntook over; two small foreign loans; the cost of quelling the Satsuma\r\nrebellion, and various debts incurred on account of public works,\r\nnaval construction, and minor purposes, we arrive at the broad fact\r\nthat the entire national debt of Japan did not exceed 305 million yen\r\nat the close of the twenty-eighth year of her new era.\r\n\r\nA war with China in 1894-1895--to be presently spoken of--and a war\r\nwith Russia in 1904-1905, together with the price paid for the\r\nnationalization of railways and for various undertakings, brought the\r\nwhole debt of the nation to 2300 million yen in 1907, which is now\r\nbeing paid off at the rate of fifty million yen annually. It remains\r\nto be noted that, in 1897, Japan took the momentous step of adopting\r\ngold monometallism. The indemnity which she obtained from China after\r\nthe war of 1894-1895 brought to her treasury a stock of gold\r\nsufficient to form a substantial specie reserve. Moreover, gold had\r\nappreciated so that its value in terms of silver had exactly doubled\r\nduring the first thirty years of the Meiji era. There was\r\nconsequently no arithmetical complication connected with the adoption\r\nof the single gold standard. It was only necessary to double the\r\ndenomination, leaving the silver subsidiary coins unchanged.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nIn the field of education the Meiji statesmen effected speedy\r\nreforms. Comparatively little attention had been directed to this\r\nsubject by the rulers of medieval Japan, and the fact that the Meiji\r\nleaders appreciated the necessity of studying the arts and sciences\r\nof the new civilization simultaneously with the adoption of its\r\nproducts, bears strong testimony to the insight of these remarkable\r\nmen. Very shortly after the abolition of feudalism, an extensive\r\nsystem of public schools was organized and education was made\r\ncompulsory. There were schools, colleges, and universities, all\r\nmodelled on foreign lines with such alterations as the special\r\ncustoms of the nation dictated. These institutions grew steadily in\r\npublic favour, and to-day over ninety per cent, of boys and girls who\r\nhave attained the school age receive education in the common\r\nelementary schools, the average annual cost per child being about 8s.\r\n6d. ($2.00), to which the parents contribute 1.75d. (3.5 cents) per\r\nmonth. Youths receiving education enjoy certain exemption from\r\nconscription, but as this is in strict accordance with the Western\r\nsystem, it need not be dwelt upon here.\r\n\r\nLOCAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nFor purposes of local administration the empire is divided into\r\nprefectures (ken), counties (gun), towns (shi), and districts (cho or\r\nson). The three metropolitan prefectures of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto\r\nare called fu, and their districts are distinguished as \"urban\" (cho)\r\nand \"rural\" (son), according to the number of houses they contain.\r\nThe prefectures derive their names from their chief towns. The\r\nprinciple of popular representation is strictly adhered to, every\r\nprefecture, every county, every town, and every district having its\r\nown local assembly, wherein the number of members is fixed in\r\nproportion to the population. These bodies are all elected. The\r\nenjoyment of the franchise depends upon a property qualification\r\nwhich, in the case of prefectural and county assemblies, is an annual\r\npayment of direct national taxes to the amount of three yen (6s.,\r\n$1.50); in the case of town and district assemblies two yen; and in\r\nthe case of prefectural assemblies, ten yen. There are other\r\narrangements to secure the due representation of property, the\r\nelectors being divided into classes according to their aggregate\r\npayment to the national treasury. Three such classes exist, and each\r\nelects one-third of an assembly's members. There is no payment for\r\nthe members of an assembly, but all salaried officials, ministers of\r\nreligion, and contractors for public works, as well as persons unable\r\nto write their own names and the names of the candidates for whom\r\nthey vote, are denied the franchise.\r\n\r\nA prefectural assembly holds one session of thirty days annually; and\r\na county assembly, one session of not more than fourteen days; while\r\nthe town and district assemblies are summoned by the mayor or the\r\nheadman whenever recourse to their deliberation appears expedient.\r\nEach prefecture has a prefect (governor) and each county assembly has\r\na headman. Both are appointed by the Central Administration, but an\r\nassembly has competence to appeal to the minister of Home Affairs\r\nfrom the prefect's decisions. In the districts, also, there are\r\nheadmen, but their post is always elective and generally\r\nnon-salaried. Other details of the local-government system are here\r\nomitted. It suffices to say that the system has been in operation for\r\nover thirty years and has been found satisfactory in practice.\r\nMoreover, these assemblies constitute excellent schools for the\r\npolitical education of the people.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the sovereign's so-called coronation\r\noath did not contemplate a national assembly in the Western sense of\r\nthe term. The first assembly convened in obedience to the oath\r\nconsisted of nobles and samurai only, and was found to be a virtually\r\nuseless body. Not till 1873, when Itagaki Taisuke, seceding from the\r\nCabinet on account of the Korean complication, became a warm advocate\r\nof appealing national questions to an elective assembly, did the\r\npeople at large come to understand what was involved in such an\r\ninstitution. Thenceforth Itagaki became the centre of a more or less\r\nenthusiastic group of men advocating a parliamentary system, some\r\nfrom sincere motives, and others from a conviction that their failure\r\nto obtain posts was in a manner due to the oligarchical form of their\r\ncountry's polity.\r\n\r\nWhen the Satsuma rebellion broke out, four years later, this band of\r\nTosa agitators memorialized the Government, charging it with\r\nadministering affairs in despite of public opinion; with ignoring\r\npopular rights, and with levelling down instead of up, since the\r\nsamurai had been reduced to the class of commoners, whereas the\r\nlatter should have been educated to the standard of the former. But\r\nthe statesmen in power insisted that the nation was not yet ready to\r\nenjoy constitutional privileges. They did not, indeed, labour under\r\nany delusion as to the ultimate direction in which their reforms\r\ntended, but they were determined to move gradually, not\r\nprecipitately. They had already (1874) arranged for the convention of\r\nan annual assembly of prefects who should act as channels of\r\ncommunication between the central authorities and the people in the\r\nprovinces. This was designed to be the embryo of representative\r\ninstitutions, though obviously it bore that character in a very\r\nlimited degree only.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1875), the second step was taken by organizing\r\na Senate (Genro-in), which consisted of official nominees and was\r\ncharged with the duty of discussing and revising laws and ordinances\r\nprior to their promulgation. But it had no power of initiative, and\r\nits credit in the eyes of the nation was more or less injured by the\r\nfact that its members consisted for the most part of men for whom no\r\nposts could be found in the administration and who, without some\r\nsteadying influence, might have been drawn into the current of\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, an event occurred which probably moved the Government\r\nto greater expedition. In the spring of 1878, the great statesman,\r\nOkubo Toshimitsu, who had acted such a prominent part on the stage of\r\nthe reformation drama, was assassinated. His slayers were avowedly\r\nsympathizers of Saigo, but in their statement of motives they\r\nassigned as their principal incentive the Government's failure to\r\nestablish representative institutions. They belonged to a province\r\nfar removed from Satsuma, and their explanation of the murder showed\r\nthat they had little knowledge of Saigo's real sentiments. But the\r\nnation saw in them champions of a constitutional form of government,\r\nand the authorities appreciated the necessity of greater expedition.\r\nThus, two months after Okubo's death, the establishment of elective\r\nassemblies in the prefectures and cities was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: OKUBO TOSHIMITSU\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to these and it will suffice here to\r\nnote that their principal functions were to determine the amount and\r\nobject of local taxes; to audit the accounts for the previous year;\r\nand to petition the Central Government, should that seem expedient.\r\nThese assemblies represented the foundations of genuinely\r\nrepresentative institutions, for although they lacked legislative\r\npower, they discharged parliamentary functions in other respects. In\r\nfact, they served as excellent training schools for the future Diet.\r\nBut this did not at all satisfy Itagaki and his followers. They had\r\nnow persuaded themselves that without a national assembly it would be\r\nimpossible to oust the clique of clansmen who monopolized the prizes\r\nof power. Accordingly, Itagaki organized an association called\r\nJiyu-to (Liberals), the first political party in Japan. Between the\r\nmen in office and these visionary agitators a time of friction, more\r\nor less severe, ensued. The Government withheld from the people the\r\nprivileges of free speech and public meeting, so that the press and\r\nthe platform found themselves in frequent collision with the police.\r\nThus, little by little, the Liberals came to be regarded as victims\r\nof official tyranny, so that they constantly obtained fresh\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nThree years subsequently (1881), another political crisis occurred.\r\nOkuma Shigenobu resigned his portfolio, and was followed into private\r\nlife by many able politicians and administrators. These organized\r\nthemselves into a party ultimately called Progressists (Shimpo-to),\r\nwho, although they professed the same doctrine as the Liberals, were\r\ncareful to maintain an independent attitude; thus showing that\r\n\"Japan's first political parties were grouped, not about principles,\r\nbut about persons.\"*\r\n\r\n*Encyclopaedia Britannica (11th edition); article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed for a moment that the Progressists were\r\nconservative. There was no such thing as real conservatism in Japan\r\nat that time. The whole nation exhaled the breath of progress.\r\nOkuma's secession was followed quickly by an edict promising the\r\nconvention of a national assembly in ten years. Confronted by this\r\nengagement, the political parties might have been expected to lay\r\ndown their arms. But a great majority of them aimed at ousting the\r\nclan-statesmen rather than at setting up a national assembly. Thus,\r\nhaving obtained a promise of a parliament, they applied themselves to\r\nexciting anti-official sentiments in the future electorates; and as\r\nthe Government made no attempt to controvert the prejudices thus\r\nexcited, it was evident that when the promised parliament came into\r\nexistence, it would become an arena for vehement attacks upon the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nOf course, as might have been expected, the ten years of agitated\r\nwaiting, between 1881 and 1891, were often disfigured by recourse to\r\nviolence. Plots to assassinate ministers; attempts to employ\r\ndynamite; schemes to bring about an insurrection in Korea--such\r\nthings were not infrequent. There were also repeated dispersions of\r\npolitical meetings by order of police inspectors, as well as\r\nsuspensions or suppressions of newspapers by the fiat of the Home\r\nminister. Ultimately it became necessary to enact a law empowering\r\nthe police to banish persons of doubtful character from Tokyo without\r\nlegal trial, and even to arrest and detain such persons on suspicion.\r\nIn 1887, the Progressist leader, Okuma, rejoined the Cabinet for a\r\ntime as minister of Foreign Affairs, but after a few months of office\r\nhis leg was shattered by a bomb and he retired into private life and\r\nfounded the Waseda University in Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be asserted that during the decade immediately prior to\r\nthe opening of the national assembly, \"an anti-Government propaganda\r\nwas incessantly preached from the platform and in the press.\" The\r\nTokyo statesmen, however, were not at all discouraged. They proceeded\r\nwith their reforms unflinchingly. In 1885, the ministry was recast,\r\nIto Hirobumi--the same Prince Ito who afterwards fell in Manchuria\r\nunder the pistol of an assassin--being appointed premier and the\r\ndepartments of State being reorganized on European lines. Then a\r\nnobility was created, with five orders, prince, marquis, count,\r\nviscount, and baron. The civil and penal laws were codified. The\r\nfinances were placed on a sound footing. A national bank with a\r\nnetwork of subordinate institutions was established. Railway\r\nconstruction was pushed on steadily. Postal and telegraph services\r\nwere extended. The foundations of a strong mercantile marine were\r\nlaid. A system of postal savings-banks was instituted. Extensive\r\nschemes of harbour improvement, roads, and riparian works were\r\nplanned and put into operation. The portals of the civil service were\r\nmade accessible solely by competitive examination. A legion of\r\nstudents was sent westward to complete their education, and the\r\ncountry's foreign affairs were managed with comparative skill.\r\n\r\nPROMULGATION OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February, 1889, the Constitution was promulgated amid\r\nsigns of universal rejoicing. The day was signalized, however, by a\r\nterrible deed. Viscount Mori, one of Japan's most enlightened\r\nstatesmen, was stabbed to death by Nishino Buntaro, a mere stripling,\r\nthe motive being to avenge what the murderer regarded as a\r\nsacrilegious act, namely, that the viscount, when visiting the shrine\r\nat Ise in the previous year, had partially raised one of the curtains\r\nwith his cane. The explanation given of this extraordinary act by a\r\nmodern historian is that \"Japan was suffering at the time from an\r\nattack of hysterical loyalty, and the shrine at Ise being dedicated\r\nto the progenitrix of the country's sovereigns, it seemed to Nishino\r\nBuntaro that when high officials began to touch the sacred\r\nparaphernalia with walking-sticks, the foundations of Imperialism\r\nwere menaced.\" An interesting light is thrown upon the Japanese\r\ncharacter in the sequel of this crime. During many subsequent years\r\nthe tomb of Nishino received the homage of men and women who\r\n\"worshipped achievement without regard to the nature of the thing\r\nachieved.\" There was a similar furore of enthusiasm over the would-be\r\nassassin of Okuma.\r\n\r\nPROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution, chief among whom was Prince Ito,\r\nnaturally took care not to make its provisions too liberal. The\r\nminimum age for electors and elected was fixed at twenty-five and the\r\nproperty qualification at payment of direct taxes aggregating not\r\nless than fifteen yen (30s. $7.20) annually.\r\n\r\nA bicameral system was adopted. The House of Peers was in part\r\nhereditary, in part elective (one representative of the highest\r\ntax-payers in each prefecture), and in part nominated by the\r\nsovereign (from among men of signal attainments), while the House of\r\nRepresentatives consisted of three hundred elected members. In the\r\neyes of party politicians this property qualification was much too\r\nhigh; it restricted the number of franchise-holders to 460,000 in a\r\nnation of nearly fifty millions. A struggle for the extension of the\r\nfranchise commenced immediately, and, after nearly ten years, the\r\nGovernment framed a bill lowering the qualification to ten yen for\r\nelectors; dispensing with it altogether in the case of candidates;\r\ninaugurating secret ballots; extending the limits of the electorates\r\nso as to include the whole of a prefecture, and increasing the\r\nmembers of the lower house to 363. By this change of qualification\r\nthe number of franchise holders was nearly doubled.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: THE LATE PRINCE ITO\r\n\r\nAs for the provisions of the Constitution, they differed in no\r\nrespect from those of the most advanced Western standard. One\r\nexception to this statement must be noted, however. The wording of\r\nthe document lent itself to the interpretation that a ministry's\r\ntenure of office depended solely on the sovereign's will. In other\r\nwords, a Cabinet received its mandate from the Throne, not from the\r\nDiet. This reservation immediately became an object of attack by\r\nparty politicians. They did not venture to protest against the\r\narrangement as an Imperial prerogative. The people would not have\r\nendured such a protest. The only course open for the party\r\npoliticians was to prove practically that a ministry not responsible\r\nto the legislature is virtually impotent for legislation.\r\n\r\nSuccess has not attended this essay. The Throne continues, nominally\r\nat all events, to appoint and dismiss ministers. As for the\r\nproceedings of the diet, the most salient feature was that, from the\r\nvery outset, the party politicians in the lower chamber engaged in\r\nsuccessive attacks upon the holders of power. This had been fully\r\nanticipated; for during the whole period of probation antecedent to\r\nthe meeting of the first Diet, the party politicians had been\r\nsuffered to discredit the Cabinet by all possible means, whereas the\r\nCabinet had made no effort to win for themselves partisans in the\r\nelectorates. They relied wholly upon the sovereign's prerogative, and\r\nstood aloof from alliances of any kind, apparently indifferent to\r\neverything but their duty to their country. Fortunately, the House of\r\nPeers ranged itself steadfastly on the side of the Cabinet throughout\r\nthis struggle, and thus the situation was often saved from apparently\r\npressing danger. The war with China (1894-1895) greatly enhanced the\r\nDiet's reputation; for all the political parties, laying aside their\r\ndifferences, without a dissenting voice voted funds for the\r\nprosecution of the campaign.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\nDuring several years the House of Representatives continued to be\r\ndivided into two great parties with nearly equally balanced\r\npower--the Liberals and the Progressists, together with a few minor\r\ncoteries. But, in 1898, the Liberals and Progressists joined hands,\r\nthus coming to wield a large majority in the lower house. Forthwith,\r\nthe Emperor, on the advice of Prince Ito, invited Counts Okuma and\r\nItagaki to form a Cabinet. An opportunity was thus given to the\r\nparties to prove the practical possibility of the system they had so\r\nlong lauded in theory. The united parties called themselves\r\nConstitutionists (Kensei-to). Their union lasted barely six months,\r\nand then \"the new links snapped under the tension of the old\r\nenmities.\"\r\n\r\nA strange thing now happened. The Liberals invited Prince Ito to be\r\ntheir leader, and he agreed on condition that his followers should\r\nobey him implicitly. A new and powerful party was thus formed under\r\nthe designation of Friends of the Constitution (Rikken Seiyukai).\r\nThus, the Liberals not only enlisted under the statesmen whose\r\noverthrow they had for nearly twenty years sought to effect, but also\r\nthey practically expunged from their platform an essential article of\r\nfaith--parliamentary cabinets. Another proof was here furnished that\r\npolitical combinations in Japan were based rather on persons than on\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nAs for the new party, even Prince Ito's wonderful talents and\r\nunequalled prestige failed to hold successfully the reins of the\r\nheterogeneous team which he had now undertaken to drive. The House of\r\nPeers opposed him on account of his association with political\r\nparties, and he at once resigned the premiership. The party he had\r\nformed did not, however, dissolve. Prince Ito, indeed, stepped out of\r\nits ranks, but he was succeeded by his intimate friend, Marquis\r\nSaionji, one of Japan's blue-blooded aristocrats, and to him the\r\nConstitutionists have yielded implicit obedience ever since. For the\r\nrest, it is impossible to foresee what the outcome of the\r\nparliamentary system will be in Japan. Up to the present the\r\nprincipal lesson learned by politicians seems to have been the value\r\nof patience. The Constitutionists have shown that they are quite\r\nready to support a Cabinet entirely independent of parties, where its\r\nmeasures seem conducive to the nation's good. Such a Cabinet was that\r\nof Prince Katsura, who, in turn, after three years' tenure of office,\r\nstepped down quietly in August, 1911, to make way for the\r\nConstitutionists, under Marquis Saionji. In a word, the nation seems\r\nto have arrived at the conclusion that these parliamentary problems\r\ncannot be safely solved except by long and deliberate experiment.*\r\n\r\n*For minute information about party politics and parliamentary\r\nprocedure see the \"Oriental Series,\" Vol. IV.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe growth of agricultural and industrial enterprise is one of the\r\nmost remarkable features of modern Japan. Up to the beginning of the\r\nMeiji era, agriculture almost monopolized attention, manufacturing\r\nindustry being altogether of a domestic character. Speaking broadly,\r\nthe gross area of land in Japan, exclusive of Saghalien, Korea, and\r\nFormosa is seventy-five million acres, and of this only some\r\nseventeen millions are arable. It may well be supposed that as rice\r\nis the principal staple of foodstuff, and as the area over which it\r\ncan be produced is so limited, the farmers have learned to apply very\r\nintensive methods of cultivation. Thus it is estimated that they\r\nspend annually twelve millions sterling--$60,000,000--on fertilizers.\r\nBy unflinching industry and skilled processes, the total yield of\r\nrice has been raised to an annual average of about fifty million\r\nkoku; that is to say, two hundred and fifty million bushels. But the\r\nday cannot be far distant when the growth of the population will\r\noutstrip that of this essential staple, and unless the assistance of\r\nKorea and Formosa can be successfully enlisted, a problem of extreme\r\ndifficulty may present itself. Meanwhile, manufacturing industry has\r\nincreased by leaps and bounds. Thus, whereas at the opening of the\r\nMeiji era, every manufacture was of a domestic character, and such a\r\nthing as a joint-stock company did not exist, there are now fully\r\n11,000 factories giving employment to 700,000 operatives, and the\r\nnumber of joint-stock companies aggregates 9000. Evidently, Japan\r\nthreatens to become a keen competitor of Europe and America in all\r\nthe markets of the Orient, for she possesses the advantage of\r\npropinquity, and as well an abundance of easily trained labour. But\r\nthere are two important conditions that offset these advantages. In\r\nthe first place Japanese wages have increased so rapidly that in the\r\nlast fifteen years they have nearly doubled, and, secondly, it must\r\nbe remembered that Japanese labour is not so efficient as that of\r\nEurope and America.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SEAL OF MUTSUHITO, THE LATE EMPEROR\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThe work of railway construction, which may be said to have commenced\r\nwith the Meiji era, has not advanced as rapidly as some other\r\nundertakings. The country has now only 5770 miles of lines open to\r\ntraffic and 1079 miles under construction. All these railways may be\r\nsaid to have been built with domestic capital. Nearly the whole was\r\nnationalized in 1907, so that the State has paid out altogether\r\nsixty-six million pounds sterling--$325,000,000--on account of\r\nrailways, an investment which yields a net return of about three and\r\na half millions sterling--$17,000,000--annually.\r\n\r\nTHE MERCANTILE MARINE\r\n\r\nAnother direction in which Japanese progress has been very marked is\r\nin the development of a mercantile marine. At an early period of the\r\ncountry's modern history, her statesmen recognized that transports\r\nare as necessary to the safety of a State as are soldiers, and, in\r\nfact, that the latter cannot be utilized without the former. The\r\nGovernment, therefore, encouraged with liberal subsidies and\r\ngrants-in-aid the purchase or construction of ships, the result being\r\nthat whereas, in 1871, Japan's mercantile marine comprised only\r\nforty-six ships with a total tonnage of 17,948, the corresponding\r\nfigures in 1910 were 6436 and 1,564,443 respectively. In the war with\r\nChina in 1894-1895, as well as in that with Russia in 1904-1905,\r\nJapan was able to carry large armies to the Asiatic continent in her\r\nown vessels, thus demonstrating the wisdom of the policy pursued by\r\nthe Government, although it had been habitually denounced by the\r\nenemies of subsidies in any circumstances. Shipbuilding yards had\r\nalso been called into existence, and there are now four of them where\r\nvessels aggregating 87,495 tons have been built.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the Satsuma rebellion of 1877 severely taxed\r\nthe military resources of the empire. In fact, the organization of\r\nspecial brigades to supplement the conscripts was found necessary.\r\nTherefore, two years later, the conscription law was revised, the\r\ntotal term of service being increased from seven years to ten, with\r\nthe result that the number of trained soldiers who could be called\r\nout in case of war became larger by fully one-half. Further, in 1882,\r\nanother expansion of armaments was effected in obedience to an\r\nImperial decree, so that when war with China broke out in 1894, Japan\r\npossessed an available force of seven divisions (including the\r\nguards), and these, raised to a war-footing, represented about\r\n150,000 men. She had already learned that, however civilized the\r\nOccident might claim to be, all the great States of the West depended\r\nmainly on military and naval force, and that only by a demonstration\r\nof that force could international respect be won.\r\n\r\nOf course, this creed was not publicly proclaimed. Firmly as Japanese\r\nstatesmen believed it, they could not confess their conviction openly\r\nin the Diet, and therefore much difficulty was experienced in\r\ninducing the two houses to endorse the Government's scheme of\r\nincreased armaments. Indeed, the subject came to be a frequent topic\r\nof discussion between the Cabinet and the House of Representatives,\r\nand in the end Japan was obliged to go into war against China without\r\na single line-of-battle ship, though her adversary possessed two.\r\nNevertheless, the Island Empire emerged signally victorious.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that she would then rest content with the\r\nassurance of safety her prowess had won. But, in the immediate sequel\r\nof the war, three of the great European powers, Russia, Germany, and\r\nFrance, joined hands to deprive Japan of the fruits of her victory by\r\ncalling upon her to vacate the southern littoral of Manchuria from\r\nthe mouth of the Yalu to the Liaotung peninsula. Japan thus acquired\r\nthe conviction that her successes against China were not estimated by\r\nWestern States as any great evidence of belligerent power, and that\r\nit would be necessary for her to fight again if she hoped to win any\r\nconsiderable measure of international respect. Prince Ito, then prime\r\nminister, keenly appreciated this necessity. He invited the Diet to\r\nvote for a substantial increment of land and sea forces, and after\r\nmuch opposition in the House of Representatives, funds were obtained\r\nfor raising the army to thirteen divisions and for an increase of the\r\nnavy which will be by and by spoken of.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of these measures found full justification, in 1904, when\r\nswords had to be crossed with Russia. After that war, which raised\r\nJapan to a leading place among the nations, the old problem came up\r\nagain for solution. Once more the Elder Statesmen--as the Meiji\r\nleaders were called--asked the Diet to maintain the organization of\r\nthe army at the point to which it had been carried during the war,\r\nand once more the lower house of the Diet proved very difficult to\r\npersuade. Ultimately, however, the law of military service was\r\nrevised so that the fixed establishment became nineteen divisions,\r\ntogether with various special corps. It is not possible to speak with\r\nabsolute accuracy of the force that Japan is now capable of\r\nmobilizing, but when the new system is in full working order, she\r\nwill be able to put something like a million and a half of men into\r\nthe fighting line. Her military budget amounts to only seven millions\r\nsterling--$35,000,000--a wonderfully small sum considering the\r\nresults obtained.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY\r\n\r\nIt has been shown how, in the year 1636, the Bakufu Government\r\nstrictly interdicted the building of all vessels of ocean-going\r\ncapacity. The veto naturally precluded enterprise in the direction of\r\nnaval expansion, and when Commodore Perry, at the head of a powerful\r\nsquadron, arrived in Uraga Bay, two centuries afterwards, the\r\nJapanese were suddenly and vividly instructed in the enormous power\r\nof a nation wielding such weapons of war. This object lesson having\r\nbeen most practically inculcated by the bombardments of Kagoshima and\r\nShimonoseki, Japan saw that she must not lose one moment in equipping\r\nherself with a naval force. At first, she had to purchase all her\r\nships from foreign countries, and so difficult was it to obtain\r\nparliamentary support for these acquisitions that, as already stated,\r\nwhen war with the neighbouring empire broke out in 1894, she did not\r\npossess a single ironclad, her strongest vessels being four\r\nsecond-class cruisers, which, according to modern ideas, would not be\r\nworthy of a place in the fighting line.\r\n\r\nDuring the next ten years the teachings of experience took deeper\r\nroot, and when the great combat with Russia commenced, the Japanese\r\nnavy included four ironclads and six armoured cruisers. The signal\r\nvictories obtained by her in that war did not induce any sentiment of\r\nself-complacency. She has gone on ever since increasing her navy, and\r\nthe present programme of her statesmen is that by the end of 1921,\r\nshe will possess twenty-five units of the first fighting line; that\r\nfigure being based on the principle that she should be competent to\r\nencounter the greatest force which any foreign State, England\r\nexcluded, will be able to mass in Far Eastern waters ten years hence.\r\nHer annual expenditure on account of the up-keep of her navy is at\r\npresent three and one-quarter million pounds sterling $17,000,000. No\r\nfeature is more remarkable than the fact that Japan can now build and\r\nequip in her own yards and arsenals warships of the largest size. She\r\nis no longer dependent on foreign countries for these essentials of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: NIJU-BASHI (DOUBLE BRIDGE) (Entrance to the present\r\nImperial Palace, at Tokyo)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nWARS WITH CHINA AND RUSSIA\r\n\r\nTHE SAGHALIEN COMPLICATION\r\n\r\nONE of the problems which invited the attention of the new Government\r\nearly in the Meiji era had been handed down from the days of\r\nfeudalism. In those days, neither Yezo nor Saghalien nor the Kurile\r\nIslands were under effective Japanese administration. The feudatory\r\nof Matsumae had his castle at the extreme south of Yezo, but the\r\njurisdiction he exercised was only nominal. Yet the earliest\r\nexplorers of Saghalien were certainly Japanese. As far back as 1620,\r\nsome vassals of the Matsumae feudatory landed on the island and\r\nremained there throughout a winter. The supposition then was that\r\nSaghalien formed part of the Asiatic mainland. But, in 1806, Mamiya\r\nRinzo, a Japanese traveller, voyaged up and down the Amur, and,\r\ncrossing to Saghalien, discovered that a narrow strait separated it\r\nfrom the continent. There still exists in Europe a theory that\r\nSaghalien's insular character was discovered first by a Russian,\r\nCaptain Nevelskoy, in 1849, but in Japan the fact had already been\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nSaghalien commands the estuary of the Amur, and Muravieff, the\r\ndistinguished Russian commander in East Asia, appreciated the\r\nnecessity of acquiring the island for his country. In 1858, he\r\nvisited Japan with a squadron and demanded that the Strait of La\r\nPérouse, which separates Saghalien from Yezo, should be regarded as\r\nthe Russo-Japanese frontier. Japan naturally refused a proposal which\r\nwould have given the whole of Saghalien to Russia, and Muravieff then\r\nresorted to the policy of sending emigrants to settle on the island.\r\nTwo futile attempts to prevent this process of gradual absorption\r\nwere made by the Japanese Government; they first proposed a division\r\nof the island, and afterwards they offered to purchase the Russian\r\nportion for a sum of about £400,000--$2,000,000. St. Petersburg\r\nseemed inclined to acquiesce, but the bargain provoked opposition in\r\nTokyo, and not until 1875 was a final settlement reached, the\r\nconditions being that Japan should recognize Russia's title to the\r\nwhole of Saghalien and Russia should recognize Japan's title to the\r\nKuriles. These latter islands had always been regarded as Japanese\r\nproperty, and therefore the arrangement now effected amounted to the\r\npurchase of an area of Japanese territory by Russia, who paid for it\r\nwith a part of Japan's belongings. An interesting sequel to this\r\nchapter of history is that, thirty years later, Saghalien became the\r\nscene of a Japanese invasion and was ultimately divided between the\r\ntwo nations along the fiftieth parallel, which was precisely what the\r\nBakufu statesmen had originally proposed.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMOSAN EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Formosa in 1874 has already been spoken of.\r\nInsignificant in itself, the incident derived vicarious interest from\r\nits effect upon the relations between Japan and China in connexion\r\nwith the ownership of the Ryukyu Islands. Lying a little south of\r\nJapan, these islands had for some centuries been regarded as an\r\nappanage of the Satsuma fief, and the language spoken by their\r\ninhabitants showed unmistakable traces of affinity with the Japanese\r\ntongue. Therefore when, in 1873, the crew of a wrecked Ryukyuan junk\r\nwas barbarously treated by the Formosan aborigines, the Yedo\r\nGovernment at once sought redress from Peking. But the Chinese paid\r\nno attention to this demand until a force of Japanese troops had made\r\na punitory visit to Formosa, and China, recognizing that her\r\nterritory had been invaded, lodged a protest which would probably\r\nhave involved the two empires in a war had not the British minister\r\nin Peking intervened. The arrangement made was that China should\r\nindemnify Japan to the extent of the expenses incurred by the latter\r\nin punishing the aborigines.\r\n\r\nTHE RYUKYU COMPLICATION\r\n\r\nA fact collaterally established by the Formosan affair was that the\r\nRyukyu Islands belonged to Japan, and, in 1876, the system of local\r\ngovernment already inaugurated in Japan proper was extended to\r\nRyukyu, the ruler of the latter being pensioned. China now formulated\r\na protest. She claimed that Ryukyu had always been a tributary of her\r\nempire. But China's interpretation of \"tribute\" was essentially\r\nunpractical. \"So long as her own advantage could be promoted, she\r\nregarded as a token of vassalage the presents periodically carried to\r\nher Court from neighbouring States, but so soon as there arose any\r\nquestion of discharging a suzerain's duties, she classed these\r\nofferings as an insignificant interchange of neighbourly courtesy.\"\r\nUndoubtedly Ryukyu, from time to time, had followed the custom of\r\ndespatching gift-bearing envoys to Peking, just as Japan herself had\r\ndone. But it was on clear record that Ryukyu had been subdued by\r\nSatsuma without any attempt whatever on China's part to save the\r\nislands from that fate; that thereafter, during two centuries, they\r\nhad been included in the Satsuma fief, and that China, in the\r\nsettlement of the Formosan complication, had constructively\r\nacknowledged Japan's title to the group. Each empire asserted its\r\nclaims with equal assurance, and things remained thus until 1880,\r\nwhen General Grant, who visited Japan in the course of a tour round\r\nthe world, suggested a peaceful compromise. A conference met in\r\nPeking, and it was agreed that the islands should be divided, Japan\r\ntaking the northern part and China the southern. But at the moment of\r\nsigning the convention, China drew back, and the discussion ended in\r\nJapan retaining the islands, China's protests being pigeonholed.\r\n\r\nKOREAN COMPLICATION\r\n\r\nSufficient reference has already been made in these pages to the\r\nseries of events that terminated in 1875, when Japan, by a display of\r\npartly fictitious force, drew Korea out of international isolation\r\nand signed with the Peninsular Kingdom a treaty acknowledging the\r\nlatter's independence.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH CHINA\r\n\r\nDuring the centuries when China occupied the undisputed position of\r\nfirst in might and first in civilization on the Asiatic continent,\r\nher habit was to use as buffer states the small countries lying\r\nimmediately beyond her borders. But she always took care to avoid any\r\nresponsibilities that might grow out of this arrangement. In a word,\r\nthe tide of foreign aggression was to be checked by an understanding\r\nthat these little countries shared the inviolability of great China,\r\nbut it was understood, at the same time, that the consequences of\r\ntheir own acts must rest upon their own heads. Such a system, having\r\nno bases except sentiment and prestige, soon proved futile in the\r\nface of Occidental practicality. Burma, Siam, Annam, and Tonking, one\r\nby one, ceased to be dependent on China and independent towards all\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nIn Korea's case, however, the fiction proved more tenacious, since\r\nthe peninsula furnished easy access to Manchuria, the cradle of the\r\nManchu dynasty. But while seeking to maintain the old-time relations\r\nwith Korea, Chinese statesmen clung uniformly to traditional methods.\r\nThey refrained from declaring Korea a dependency of China, yet they\r\nsought to keep up \"the romance of ultimate dependency and\r\nintermediate sovereignty.\" It was thus that, in 1876, Korea was\r\nallowed to conclude with Japan a treaty describing the former as \"an\r\nindependent State enjoying the same rights as Japan,\" nor did the\r\nPeking Government make any protest when the United States, Great\r\nBritain, and other powers concluded similar treaties.\r\n\r\nTo exercise independence in practice, however, was not permitted to\r\nKorea. A Chinese resident was stationed in Seoul, the Korean capital,\r\nand he quickly became an imperium in imperio. Thenceforth Japan, in\r\nall her dealings with the Peninsular Kingdom, found the latter\r\nbehaving as a Chinese dependency, obeying the Chinese resident in\r\neverything. Again and again, Japanese patience was tried by these\r\nanomalous conditions, and although nothing occurred of sufficient\r\nmagnitude to warrant official protest, the Tokyo Government became\r\nsensible of perpetual rebuffs and humiliating interferences at\r\nChina's hands. Korea herself suffered seriously from this state of\r\nnational irresponsibility. There was no security of life and\r\nproperty, or any effective desire to develop the country's resources.\r\nIf the victims of oppression appealed to force, China readily lent\r\nmilitary assistance to suppress them, and thus the royal family of\r\nKorea learned to regard its tenure of power as dependent on ability\r\nto conciliate China.\r\n\r\nOn Japan's side, also, the Korean question caused much anxiety. It\r\nwas impossible for the Tokyo statesmen to ignore the fact that their\r\ncountry's safety depended largely on preserving Korea from the grasp\r\nof a Western power. They saw plainly that such a result might at any\r\nmoment be expected if Korea was suffered to drift into a state of\r\nadministrative incompetence. Once, in 1882, and again, in 1884, when\r\nChinese soldiers were employed to suppress reform movements which\r\nwould have impaired the interests of the Korean monarch, the latter's\r\npeople, counting Japan to be the source of progressive tendencies in\r\nthe East, destroyed her legation in Seoul, driving its inmates out of\r\nthe city. Japan was not yet prepared to assert herself forcibly in\r\nredress of such outrages, but in the ensuing negotiations she\r\nacquired titles that \"touched the core of China's alleged\r\nSuzerainty.\" Thus, in 1882, Japan obtained recognition of her right\r\nto protect her legation with troops; and, in 1885, a convention,\r\nsigned at Tientsin, pledged each of the contracting parties not to\r\nsend a military force to Korea without notifying the other.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these agreements China's arbitrary and unfriendly\r\ninterference in Korean affairs continued to be demonstrated to Japan.\r\nEfforts to obtain redress proved futile, and even provoked threats of\r\nChinese armed intervention. Finally, in the spring of 1894, an\r\ninsurrection of some magnitude broke out in Korea, and in response to\r\nan appeal from the Royal family, China sent twenty-five hundred\r\ntroops, who went into camp at Asan, on the southwest coast of the\r\npeninsula. Notice was duly given to the Tokyo Government, which now\r\ndecided that Japan's vital interests as well as the cause of\r\ncivilization in the East required that an end must be put to Korea's\r\ndangerous misrule and to China's arbitrary interference. Japan did\r\nnot claim for herself anything that she was not willing to accord to\r\nChina. But the Tokyo statesmen were sensible that to ask their\r\nconservative neighbour to promote in the Peninsular Kingdom a\r\nprogressive programme which she had always steadily rejected and\r\ndespised in her own case, must prove a chimerical attempt, if\r\nordinary diplomatic methods alone were used. Accordingly, on receipt\r\nof Peking's notice as to the sending of troops to the peninsula,\r\nJapan gave corresponding notice on her own part, and thus July, 1894,\r\nsaw a Chinese force encamped at Asan and a Japanese force in the\r\nvicinity of Seoul.\r\n\r\nIn having recourse to military aid, China's nominal purpose was to\r\nquell the Tonghak insurrection, and Japan's motive was to obtain a\r\nposition such as would strengthen her demand for drastic treatment of\r\nKorea's malady. In giving notice of the despatch of troops, China\r\ndescribed Korea as her \"tributary State,\" thus emphasizing a\r\ncontention which at once created an impossible situation. During\r\nnearly twenty years Japan had treated Korea as her own equal, in\r\naccordance with the terms of the treaty of 1876, and she could not\r\nnow agree that the Peninsular Kingdom should be officially classed as\r\na tributary of China. Her protests, however, were contemptuously\r\nignored, and Chinese statesmen continued to apply the offensive\r\nappellation to Korea, while at the same time they asserted the right\r\nof limiting the number of troops sent by Japan to the peninsula as\r\nwell as the manner of their employment.\r\n\r\nStill desirous of preserving the peace, Japan proposed a union\r\nbetween herself and China for the purpose of restoring order in Korea\r\nand amending that country's administration. China refused. She even\r\nexpressed supercilious surprise that Japan, while asserting Korea's\r\nindependence, should suggest the idea of peremptorily reforming its\r\nadministration. The Tokyo Cabinet now announced that the Japanese\r\ntroops should not be withdrawn without \"some understanding that would\r\nguarantee the future peace, order, and good government of Korea,\" and\r\nas China still refused to come to such an understanding, Japan\r\nundertook the work single-handed.\r\n\r\nThe Tonghak rebellion, which Chinese troops were originally sent to\r\nquell, had died of inanition before they landed. The troops,\r\ntherefore, had been withdrawn. But China kept them in Korea, her\r\navowed reason being the presence of the Japanese military force near\r\nSeoul. In these circumstances, Peking was notified that a despatch of\r\nre-enforcements on China's side must be construed as an act of\r\nhostility. Notwithstanding this notice, China not only sent a further\r\nbody of troops by sea to encamp at Asan, but also despatched an army\r\noverland across the Yalu. These proceedings precipitated hostilities.\r\nThree Chinese warships, convoying a transport with twelve hundred\r\nsoldiers on board, met and opened fire on two Japanese cruisers. The\r\nresult was signal. One of the Chinese warships was captured, another\r\nwas so riddled with shot that she had to be beached and abandoned;\r\nthe third escaped in a dilapidated condition, and the transport,\r\nrefusing to surrender, was sent to the bottom. These things happened\r\non the 25th of July, 1894, and war was declared by each empire six\r\ndays subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese took the initiative. They despatched from Seoul a column\r\nof troops and routed the Chinese entrenched at Asan, many of whom\r\nfled northward to Pyong-yang, a town on the Tadong River, memorable\r\nas the scene of a battle between a Chinese and a Japanese army in\r\n1592. Pyong-yang offered great facilities for defence. The Chinese\r\nmassed there a force of seventeen thousand men, and made preparations\r\nfor a decisive contest, building parapets, mounting guns, and\r\nstrengthening the position by every device of modern warfare. Their\r\ninfantry had the advantage of being armed with repeating rifles, and\r\nthe configuration of the ground offered little cover for an attacking\r\narmy. Against this strong position the Japanese moved in two columns;\r\none marching northward from Seoul, the other striking westward from\r\nYuensan. Forty days elapsed before the Japanese forces came into\r\naction, and one day's fighting sufficed to carry all the Chinese\r\npositions, the attacking armies having only seven hundred casualties\r\nand the defenders, six thousand.\r\n\r\nThe next day, September 17th, Japan achieved an equally conspicuous\r\nsuccess at sea. Fourteen Chinese warships and six torpedo-boats,\r\nsteering homeward after convoying a fleet of transports to the mouth\r\nof the Yalu River, fell in with eleven Japanese war-vessels cruising\r\nin the Yellow Sea. The Chinese squadron was not seeking an encounter.\r\nTheir commanding officer did not appear to appreciate the value of\r\nsea-power. His fleet included two armoured battle-ships of over seven\r\nthousand tons' displacement, whereas the Japanese had nothing\r\nstronger than belted cruisers of four thousand. Therefore a little\r\nenterprise on China's part might have severed Japan's maritime\r\ncommunications and compelled her to evacuate Korea. The Chinese,\r\nhowever, used their war-vessels as convoys only, keeping them\r\ncarefully in port when no such duty was to be performed. It is\r\nevident that, as a matter of choice, they would have avoided the\r\nbattle of the Yalu, though when compelled to fight they fought\r\nstoutly. After a sharp engagement, four of their vessels were sunk,\r\nand the remainder steamed into Weihaiwei, their retreat being covered\r\nby torpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nBy this victory the maritime route to China lay open to Japan. She\r\ncould now attack Talien, Port Arthur, and Weihaiwei, naval stations\r\non the Liaotung and Shantung peninsulas, where strong permanent\r\nfortifications had been built under the direction of European\r\nexperts. These forts fell one by one before the assaults of the\r\nJapanese troops as easily as the castle of Pyong-yang had fallen.\r\nOnly by the remains of the Chinese fleet at Weihaiwei was a stubborn\r\nresistance made, under the command of Admiral Ting. But, after the\r\nentire squadron of torpedo craft had been captured, and after three\r\nof the largest Chinese ships had been sent to the bottom by Japanese\r\ntorpedoes, and one had met the same fate by gunfire, the remainder\r\nsurrendered, and their gallant commander, Admiral Ting, rejecting all\r\novertures from the Japanese, committed suicide.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Weihaiwei ended the war. It had lasted seven and a half\r\nmonths, and during that time the Japanese had operated with five\r\ncolumns aggregating 120,000 men. \"One of these columns marched\r\nnorthward from Seoul, won the battle of Pyong-yang, advanced to the\r\nYalu, forced its way into Manchuria, and moved towards Mukden by\r\nFeng-hwang, fighting several minor engagements, and conducting the\r\ngreater part of its operations amid deep snow in midwinter. The\r\nsecond column diverged westward from the Yalu, and, marching through\r\nsouthern Manchuria, reached Haicheng, whence it advanced to the\r\ncapture of Niuchwang. The third landed on the Liaotung peninsula,\r\nand, turning southward, carried Talien and Port Arthur by assault.\r\nThe fourth moved up the Liaotung peninsula, and, having seized\r\nKaiping, advanced against Niuchwang, where it joined hands with the\r\nsecond column. The fifth crossed from Port Arthur to Weihaiwei, which\r\nit captured.\" In all these operations the Japanese casualties\r\ntotalled 1005 killed and 4922 wounded; the deaths from disease\r\naggregated 16,866, and the monetary expenditure amounted to twenty\r\nmillions sterling, about $100,000,000. It had been almost universally\r\nbelieved that, although Japan might have some success at the outset,\r\nshe would ultimately be shattered by impact with the enormous mass\r\nand the overwhelming resources of China. Never was forecast more\r\nsignally contradicted by events.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF PEACE\r\n\r\nLi Hung-chang, viceroy of Pehchili, whose troops had been chiefly\r\nengaged during the war, and who had been mainly responsible for the\r\ndiplomacy that had led up to it, was sent by China as plenipotentiary\r\nto discuss terms of peace. The conference took place at Shimonoseki,\r\nJapan being represented by Marquis (afterwards Prince) Ito, and on\r\nthe 17th of April, 1895, the treaty was signed. It recognized the\r\nindependence of Korea; ceded to Japan the littoral of Manchuria lying\r\nsouth of a line drawn from the mouth of the river Anping to the\r\nestuary of the Liao, together with the islands of Formosa and the\r\nPescadores; pledged China to pay an indemnity of two hundred million\r\ntaels; provided for the occupation of Weihaiwei by Japan pending\r\npayment of that sum; secured the opening of four new places to\r\nforeign trade and the right of foreigners to engage in manufacturing\r\nenterprises in China, and provided for a treaty of commerce and amity\r\nbetween the two empires, based on the lines of China's treaty with\r\nOccidental powers.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INTERFERENCE\r\n\r\nScarcely was the ink dry upon this agreement when Russia, Germany,\r\nand France presented a joint note to the Tokyo Government, urging\r\nthat the permanent occupation of the Manchurian littoral by Japan\r\nwould endanger peace. Japan had no choice but to bow to this mandate.\r\nThe Chinese campaign had exhausted her treasury as well as her\r\nsupplies of war material, and it would have been hopeless to oppose a\r\ncoalition of three great European powers. She showed no sign of\r\nhesitation. On the very day of the ratified treaty's publication, the\r\nEmperor of Japan issued a rescript, in which, after avowing his\r\ndevotion to the cause of peace, he \"yielded to the dictates of\r\nmagnanimity, and accepted the advice of the three powers.\"\r\n\r\nBut although the Tokyo Government sought to soften the situation by\r\nthe grace of speedy acquiescence, the effect produced upon the nation\r\nwas profound. There was no difficulty in appreciating the motives of\r\nRussia and France. It was natural that the former should object to\r\nthe propinquity of a warlike people like the Japanese, and it was\r\nnatural that France should remain true to her ally. But Germany's\r\ncase defied interpretation. She had no interest in the ownership of\r\nManchuria, and she professed herself a warm friend of Japan. It\r\nseemed, therefore, that she had joined in snatching from the lips of\r\nthe Japanese the fruits of their victory simply for the sake of\r\nestablishing some shadowy title to Russia's good-will.\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE CRISIS OF 1900\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the year 1900 an anti-foreign outbreak, known\r\nas the \"Boxer Rebellion,\" broke out in the province of Shantung, and,\r\nspreading thence to Pehchili, produced a situation of imminent peril\r\nfor the foreign communities of Peking and Tientsin. No Western power\r\ncould intervene with sufficient promptness. Japan alone was within\r\neasy reach of the commotion. But Japan held back. She had fully\r\nfathomed the distrust with which the growth of her military strength\r\nhad inspired some European nations, and she appreciated the wisdom of\r\nnot seeming to grasp at an opportunity for armed display. In fact,\r\nshe awaited a clear mandate from Europe and America, and, on\r\nreceiving it, she rapidly sent a division (20,000 men) to Pehchili.\r\nTientsin was relieved first, and then a column of troops provided by\r\nseveral powers, the Japanese in the van, marched to the succour of\r\nPeking. In this campaign the Japanese greatly enhanced their\r\nbelligerent reputation as they fought under the eyes of competent\r\nmilitary critics. Moreover, after the relief of the legations in\r\nPeking, they withdrew one-half of their forces, and they subsequently\r\ncooperated heartily with Western powers in negotiating peace terms,\r\nthus disarming the suspicions with which they had been regarded at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nWAR WITH RUSSIA\r\n\r\nFrom the time (1895) when the three-power mandate dictated to Japan a\r\ncardinal alteration of the Shimonoseki treaty, Japanese statesmen\r\nconcluded that their country must one day cross swords with Russia.\r\nNot a few Occidental publicists shared that view, but the great\r\nmajority, arguing that the little Island Empire of the Far East would\r\nnever risk annihilation by such an encounter, believed that\r\nforbearance sufficient to avert serious trouble would always be\r\nforthcoming on Japan's side. Yet neither geographical nor historical\r\nconditions warranted that confidence. The Sea of Japan, which, on the\r\neast, washes the shores of the Japanese islands and on the west those\r\nof Russia and Korea, has virtually only two routes communicating with\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. One is in the north, namely, the Tsugaru Strait;\r\nthe other is in the south, namely, the channel between the Korean\r\npeninsula and the Japanese island of Kyushu. Tsugaru Strait is\r\npractically under Japan's complete control; she can close it at any\r\nmoment with mines. But the channel between the Korean peninsula and\r\nKyushu has a width of 102 miles, and would therefore be a fine open\r\nseaway were it free from islands. Midway in this channel, however,\r\nlie the twin islands of Tsushima, and the space that separates them\r\nfrom Japan is narrowed by another island, Iki. Tsushima and Iki have\r\nbelonged to Japan from time immemorial, and thus the avenues from the\r\nPacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan are controlled by the Japanese\r\nempire. In other words, access to the Pacific from Korea's eastern\r\nand southern coasts, and access to the Pacific from Russia's Maritime\r\nProvince depend upon Japan's good-will.\r\n\r\nThese geographical conditions had no great concern for Korea in\r\nformer days. But with Russia the case was different. Vladivostok, the\r\nprincipal port in the Far East, lay at the southern extremity of the\r\nMaritime Province. Freedom of passage by the Tsushima Strait was\r\ntherefore a matter of vital importance, and to secure it one of two\r\nthings was essential, namely, that she herself should possess a\r\nfortified port on the Korean side, or that Japan should be restrained\r\nfrom acquiring such a port. Here, then, was a strong inducement for\r\nRussian aggression in Korea. When the eastward movement of the great\r\nnorthern power brought it to the mouth of the Amur, the acquisition\r\nof Nikolaievsk for a naval basis was the immediate reward. But\r\nNikolaievsk, lying in an inhospitable region, far away from all the\r\nmain routes of the world's commerce, offered itself only as a\r\nstepping-stone to further acquisitions. To push southward from this\r\nnew port became an immediate object.\r\n\r\nThere lay an obstacle in the way. The long strip of seacoast from the\r\nmouth of the Amur to the Korean frontier--an area then called the\r\nUsuri region because that river forms part of its western\r\nboundary--belonged to China, and she, having conceded much to Russia\r\nin the way of the Amur, showed no inclination to make further\r\nconcessions in the matter of the Usuri. She was persuaded to agree,\r\nhowever, that the region should be regarded as common property,\r\npending a convenient opportunity for clear delimitation. That\r\nopportunity soon came. Seizing the moment (1860) when China had been\r\nbeaten to her knees by England and France, Russia secured the final\r\ncession of the Usuri region, which then became the Maritime Province\r\nof Siberia. Then Russia shifted her naval basis in the Pacific to a\r\npoint ten degrees south from Nikolaievsk, namely, Vladivostok.\r\nImmediately after this transfer an attempt was made to obtain\r\npossession of Tsushima. A Russian man-of-war proceeded thither, and\r\nquietly began to establish a settlement which would soon have\r\nconstituted a title of ownership had not Great Britain interfered.\r\nThe same instinct that led Russia from the mouth of the Amur to\r\nVladivostok prompted the acquisition of Saghalien also, which, as\r\nalready related, was accomplished in 1875.\r\n\r\nBut all this effort did not procure for Russia an unobstructed avenue\r\nfrom Vladivostok to the Pacific or an ice-free port in the Far East.\r\nIn Korea seemed to lie a facile hope of saving the maritime results\r\nof Russia's great trans-Asian march from Lake Baikal to the Maritime\r\nProvince and to Saghalien. Korea seemed to offer every facility for\r\nsuch an enterprise. Her people were unprogressive; her resources\r\nundeveloped; her self-defensive capacities insignificant; her\r\ngovernment corrupt. On the other hand, it could not be expected that\r\nJapan and China would acquiesce in any aggressions against their\r\nneighbour, Korea, and it became necessary that Russia should seek\r\nsome other line of communication supplementing the Amur waterway and\r\nthe long ocean route. Therefore she set about the construction of a\r\nrailway across Asia. This railway had to be carried along the\r\nnorthern bank of the Amur where engineering and economic difficulties\r\nabound. Moreover, the river makes a huge semicircular sweep\r\nnorthward, and a railway following its northern bank to Vladivostok\r\nmust make the same detour. If, on the contrary, the road could be\r\ncarried south of the river along the diameter of the semicircle, it\r\nwould be a straight, and therefore a shorter, line, technically\r\neasier and economically better. To follow this diameter, however,\r\nwould involve passing through Chinese territory, namely, Manchuria,\r\nand an excuse for soliciting China's permission was not in sight. In\r\n1894, however, war broke out between Japan and China, and in its\r\nsequel Japan passed into possession of the southern littoral of\r\nManchuria, which meant that Russia could never get nearer to the\r\nPacific than Vladivostok, unless she swept Japan from her path. It is\r\nhere, doubtless, that we must find Russia's true motive in inducing\r\nGermany and France to unite with her for the purpose of ousting Japan\r\nfrom Manchuria. The \"notice to quit\" gave for reasons that the tenure\r\nof the Manchurian littoral by Japan would menace the security of the\r\nChinese capital, would render the independence of Korea illusory, and\r\nwould constitute an obstacle to the peace of the Orient. Only one\r\nsaving clause offered for Japan--to obtain from China a guarantee\r\nthat no portion of Manchuria should thereafter be leased or ceded to\r\na foreign State. But France warned the Tokyo Government that to press\r\nfor such a guarantee would offend Russia, and Russia declared that,\r\nfor her part, she entertained no design of trespassing in Manchuria.\r\nThus, Japan had no choice but to surrender quietly the main fruits of\r\nher victory. She did so, and proceeded to double her army and treble\r\nher navy.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA'S AND GERMANY'S REWARDS\r\n\r\nAs a recompense for the assistance nominally rendered to China in the\r\nabove matter, Russia obtained permission in Peking to divert her\r\ntrans-Asian railway from the huge bend of the Amur to the straight\r\nline through Manchuria. Neither Germany nor France received any\r\nimmediate compensation. But three years later, by way of indemnity\r\nfor the murder of two missionaries by a Chinese mob, Germany seized a\r\nportion of the province of Shantung, and forthwith Russia obtained a\r\nlease of the Liaotung peninsula, from which she had driven Japan in\r\n1895. This act she followed by extorting from China permission to\r\nconstruct a branch of the trans-Asian railway from north to south,\r\nthat is to say from Harbin through Mukden to Talien and Port Arthur.\r\nRussia's maritime aspirations had now assumed a radically altered\r\nphase. Hitherto her programme had been to push southward from\r\nVladivostok along the coast of Korea, but she had now suddenly leaped\r\nKorea and found access to the Pacific by the Liaotung peninsula.\r\nNothing was wanting to establish her as practical mistress of\r\nManchuria except a plausible excuse for garrisoning the place. Such\r\nan excuse was furnished by the Boxer rising, in 1900. The conclusion\r\nof that complication found her in practical occupation of the whole\r\nregion. But here her diplomacy fell somewhat from its usually high\r\nstandard. Imagining that the Chinese could be persuaded, or\r\nintimidated, to any concession, she proposed a convention virtually\r\nrecognizing her title to Manchuria.\r\n\r\nJAPAN'S ATTITUDE\r\n\r\nJapan watched all these things with profound anxiety. If there\r\nwere any reality in the dangers which Russia, Germany, and France\r\nhad declared to be incidental to Japanese occupation of a part\r\nof Manchuria, the same dangers must be doubly incidental to\r\nRussian occupation of the whole of Manchuria. There were other\r\nconsiderations, also. The reasons already adduced show that the\r\nindependence of Korea was an object of supreme solicitude to Japan.\r\nIt was to establish that independence that she fought with China,\r\nin 1894, and the same motive led her after the war to annex the\r\nManchurian littoral adjacent to Korea's northern frontier. If Russia\r\ncame into possession of all Manchuria, her subsequent absorption of\r\nKorea would be almost inevitable. Manchuria is larger than France and\r\nthe United Kingdom put together. The addition of such an immense area\r\nto Russia's East Asiatic dominions, together with its littoral on the\r\nGulf of Pehchili and the Yellow Sea, would necessitate a\r\ncorresponding expansion of her naval force in the Far East. With the\r\nexception of Port Arthur and Talien, however, the Manchurian coast\r\ndoes not offer any convenient naval base. It is only in the harbours\r\nof southern Korea that such bases can be found. In short, without\r\nKorea, Russia's East Asian extension would have been economically\r\nincomplete and strategically defective.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why, apart from history and national sentiment, Japan\r\nshould object to Russia in Korea, the answer is, first, because there\r\nwould thus be planted almost within cannon-shot of her shores a power\r\nof enormous strength and traditional ambition; secondly, because\r\nwhatever voice in Manchuria's destiny Russia derived from her\r\nrailway, the same voice in Korea's destiny was possessed by Japan, as\r\nthe sole owner of the railways in the Korean peninsula; thirdly, that\r\nwhereas Russia had an altogether insignificant share in the foreign\r\ncommerce of Korea and scarcely ten bona fide settlers, Japan did the\r\ngreater part of the oversea trade and had tens of thousands of\r\nsettlers; fourthly, that if Russia's dominions stretched\r\nuninterruptedly from the sea of Okhotsk to the Gulf of Pehchili, her\r\nultimate absorption of northern China would be inevitable, and\r\nfifthly, that such domination and such absorption would involve the\r\npractical closure of all that immense region to the commerce and\r\nindustry of every Western nation except Russia.\r\n\r\nThis last proposition did not rest solely on the fact that in\r\nopposing artificial barriers to free competition lies Russia's sole\r\nhope of utilizing, to her own benefit, any commercial opportunities\r\nbrought within her reach. It rested, also, on the fact that Russia\r\nhad objected to foreign settlement at the Manchurian marts recently\r\nopened, by Japan's treaty with China, to American and Japanese\r\nsubjects. Without settlements, trade at those marts would be\r\nimpossible, and thus Russia had constructively announced that there\r\nshould be no trade but the Russian, if she could prevent it. Against\r\nsuch dangers Japan would have been justified in adopting any measure\r\nof self-protection. She had foreseen them for six years and had been\r\nstrengthening herself to avert them. But she wanted peace. She wanted\r\nto develop her material resources and to accumulate some measure of\r\nwealth without which she must remain insignificant among the nations.\r\n\r\nTwo pacific programmes offered and she adopted them both. Russia,\r\ninstead of trusting time to consolidate her tenure of Manchuria, had\r\nmade the mistake of pragmatically importuning China for a\r\nconventional title. If, then, Peking could be strengthened to resist\r\nthis demand, some arrangement of a distinctly terminable nature might\r\nbe made. The United States, Great Britain, and Japan, joining hands\r\nfor that purpose, did succeed in so far stiffening China's backbone\r\nthat her show of resolution finally induced Russia to sign a treaty\r\npledging herself to withdraw her troops from Manchuria in three\r\ninstallments, each step of evacuation to be accomplished by a fixed\r\ndate. That was one of the pacific programmes. The other suggested\r\nitself in connexion with the new commercial treaties which China had\r\nagreed to negotiate in the sequel of the Boxer troubles. These\r\ndocuments contained clauses providing for the opening of three places\r\nin Manchuria to foreign trade. It seemed a reasonable hope that the\r\npowers, having secured commercial access to Manchuria by covenant\r\nwith its sovereign, would not allow Russia to restrict arbitrarily\r\ntheir privileges. Both of these hopes were disappointed. When the\r\ntime came for evacuation, Russia behaved as though no promise had\r\nbeen given. She proposed new conditions which would have strengthened\r\nher grasp of Manchuria instead of loosening it.\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND JAPAN\r\n\r\nChina being powerless to offer any practical protest, and Japan's\r\ninterest ranking next in order of importance, the Tokyo Government\r\napproached Russia direct. They did not ask for anything that could\r\nhurt her pride or impair her position. Appreciating fully the\r\neconomical status she had acquired in Manchuria by large outlays of\r\ncapital, they offered to recognize that status, provided that Russia\r\nwould extend similar recognition to Japan's status in Korea; would\r\npromise, in common with Japan, to respect the sovereignty and the\r\nterritorial integrity of China and Korea, and would be a party to a\r\nmutual engagement that all nations should have equal commercial and\r\nindustrial opportunities in Manchuria and in the Korean peninsula. In\r\na word, they invited Russia to subscribe the policy originally\r\nenunciated by the United States and Great Britain, the policy of the\r\nopen door and of the integrity of the Chinese and Korean empires.\r\n\r\nThus commenced negotiations which lasted five and a half months.\r\nJapan gradually reduced her demands to a minimum. Russia never made\r\nany appreciable reduction of hers. She refused to listen to Japan for\r\none moment about Manchuria. Eight years previously, Japan had been in\r\nmilitary possession of the littoral of Manchuria when Russia, with\r\nthe assistance of Germany and France, had expelled her for reasons\r\nwhich concerned Japan much more than they concerned any of these\r\nthree powers. Now, Russia had the assurance to declare that none of\r\nthese things concerned Japan at all. The utmost she would admit was\r\nJapan's partial right to be heard about Korea. At the same time, she\r\nherself commenced a series of aggressions in northern Korea. That was\r\nnot all. While she studiously deferred her answers to Japan's\r\nproposals, and while she protracted the negotiations to an extent\r\nvisibly contemptuous, she hastened to make substantial additions to\r\nher fleet and her army in far-eastern Asia. It was impossible to\r\nmistake her purpose. She intended to yield nothing, but to prepare\r\nsuch a parade of force that her obduracy would command submission.\r\nThe only alternatives for Japan were war or permanent effacement in\r\nAsia. She chose war.\r\n\r\nEXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the story of this war, it is necessary to refer to\r\ntwo incidents of Japan's foreign relations, both of which preceded\r\nher struggle with Russia. The first was the restoration of her\r\njudicial autonomy. It has always been regarded as axiomatic that the\r\nsubjects or citizens of Western countries, when they travel or reside\r\nin Oriental territories, should be exempted from the penalties and\r\nprocesses of the latter's criminal laws. In other words, there is\r\nreserved to a Christian the privilege, when within the territories of\r\na pagan State, of being tried for penal offences by Christian judges.\r\nIn civil cases the jurisdiction is divided, the question at issue\r\nbeing adjudicated by a tribunal of the defendant's nationality;\r\nbut in criminal cases jurisdiction is wholly reserved. Therefore\r\npowers making treaties with Oriental nations establish within\r\nthe latter's borders consular courts which exercise what is called\r\n\"extraterritorial jurisdiction.\" This system was, of course, pursued\r\nin Japan's case. It involved the confinement of the foreign residents\r\nto settlements grouped around the sites of their consular courts; for\r\nit would plainly have been imprudent that such residents should have\r\nfree access to provincial districts remote from the only tribunals\r\ncompetent to control them.\r\n\r\nThis provision, though inserted without difficulty in the early\r\ntreaties with Japan, provoked much indignation among the conservative\r\nstatesmen in Kyoto. Accordingly, no sooner had the Meiji Restoration\r\nbeen effected than an embassy was despatched to the Occident to\r\nnegotiate for a revision of the treaties so as to remove the clause\r\nabout consular jurisdiction, and to restore the customs tariff to the\r\nfigure at which it had stood prior to Sir Harry Parkes' naval\r\ndemonstration at Hyogo. The Japanese Government was entitled to raise\r\nthis question in 1871, for the treaties were textually subject to\r\nrevision in that year. No time was lost in despatching the embassy.\r\nBut its failure was a foregone conclusion. The conditions originally\r\nnecessitating extraterritorial jurisdiction had not, by 1871\r\nundergone any change justifying its abolition. It is not to be\r\ndenied, on the other hand, that the consular courts themselves\r\ninvited criticism. Some of the great Western powers had organized\r\ncompetent tribunals with expert judicial officials, but others, whose\r\ntrade with Japan was comparatively insignificant, were content to\r\nentrust consular duties to merchants, who not only lacked legal\r\ntraining but were also themselves engaged in the commercial\r\ntransactions upon which they might, at any moment, be required to\r\nadjudicate magisterially.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: DANJURO, A FAMOUS ACTOR, AS BENKEI IN KANJINCHO (A PLAY)\r\n\r\nIt cannot be contended that this obviously imperfect system was\r\ndisfigured by many abuses. On the whole, it worked passably well, and\r\nif its organic faults helped to discredit it, there is no denying\r\nthat it saved the Japanese from complications which would inevitably\r\nhave arisen had they been entrusted with jurisdiction which they were\r\nnot prepared to exercise satisfactorily. Moreover, the system had\r\nvicarious usefulness; for the ardent desire of Japanese patriots to\r\nrecover the judicial autonomy, which is a fundamental attribute of\r\nevery sovereign State, impelled them to recast their laws and\r\nreorganize their law courts with a degree of diligence which would\r\notherwise have probably been less conspicuous. Twelve years of this\r\nwork, carried on with the aid of thoroughly competent foreign\r\njurists, placed Japan in possession of codes of criminal and civil\r\nlaw in which the best features of European jurisprudence were applied\r\nto the conditions and usages of Japan. Then, in 1883, Japan renewed\r\nher proposal for the abolition of consular jurisdiction, and by way\r\nof compensation she promised to throw the country completely open and\r\nto remove all restrictions hitherto imposed on foreign trade, travel,\r\nand residence within her realm.\r\n\r\nBut this was a problem against whose liberal solution the\r\ninternational prejudice of the West was strongly enlisted. No\r\nOriental State had ever previously sought such recognition, and the\r\nOccident, without exception, was extremely reluctant to entrust the\r\nlives and properties of its subjects and citizens to the keeping of a\r\n\"pagan\" people. Not unnaturally the foreigners resident in Japan, who\r\nwould have been directly affected by the change, protested against it\r\nwith great vehemence. Many of them, though not averse to trusting\r\nJapan, saw that her reforms had been consummated with celerity\r\namounting to haste, and a great majority fought simply for consular\r\njurisdiction as a privilege of inestimable value, not to be\r\nsurrendered without the utmost deliberation. The struggle that ensued\r\nbetween foreign distrust and Japanese aspirations often developed\r\npainful phases, and did much to intensify the feeling of antagonism\r\nwhich had existed between the Japanese and the foreign residents at\r\nthe outset and which even to-day has not wholly disappeared. The\r\nGovernment and citizens of the United States of America never failed\r\nto show sympathy with Japanese aspirations in this matter, and, as a\r\ngeneral rule, \"foreign tourists and publicists discussed the problem\r\nliberally and fairly, perhaps because, unlike the foreign communities\r\nresident in Japan, they had no direct interest in its solution.\"\r\n\r\nThe end was not reached until 1894. Then Great Britain agreed that\r\nfrom July, 1899, jurisdiction over all British subjects within the\r\nconfines of Japan should be entrusted to Japanese tribunals, provided\r\nthat the new Japanese codes of law should have been in operation\r\nduring at least one year before the surrender of jurisdiction. Japan,\r\non her side, promised to throw the whole country open from the same\r\ndate, removing all limitations upon trade, travel, and residence of\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nTariff autonomy had been an almost equal object of Japanese ambition,\r\nand it was arranged that she should recover it after a period of\r\ntwelve years, an increased scale of import duties being applied in\r\nthe interval. It will be observed that Great Britain took the lead in\r\nabandoning the old system. It was meet that she should do so; for, in\r\nconsequence of her preponderating commercial interests, she had stood\r\nat the head of the combination of powers by which the irksome\r\nconditions were originally imposed upon Japan. The other Occidental\r\nStates followed her example with more or less celerity, and the\r\nforeign residents, now that nothing was to be gained by continuing\r\nthe struggle, showed clearly that they intended to bow gracefully to\r\nthe inevitable. The Japanese also took some conspicuous steps.\r\n\r\n\"An Imperial rescript declared in unequivocal terms that it was the\r\nsovereign's policy and desire to abolish all distinctions between\r\nnatives and foreigners, and that, by fully carrying out the friendly\r\npurpose of the treaties, his people would best consult his wishes,\r\nmaintain the character of the nation, and promote its prestige. The\r\npremier and other ministers of State issued instructions to the\r\neffect that the responsibility now devolved on the Government, and\r\nthe duty on the people, of enabling foreigners to reside confidently\r\nand contentedly in every part of the country. Even the chief Buddhist\r\nprelates addressed to the priests and parishioners of their dioceses\r\ninjunctions pointing out that freedom of conscience being now\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution, men professing alien creeds must be\r\ntreated as courteously as the disciples of Buddhism and must enjoy\r\nthe same privileges.\"*\r\n\r\n*Brinkley, article \"Japan,\" Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition.\r\n\r\nIt may here be stated once for all that Japan's recovery of her\r\njudicial autonomy has not been attended by any of the disastrous\r\nresults freely predicted at one time. Her laws are excellent, and her\r\njudiciary is competent and just.\r\n\r\nFIRST ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE\r\n\r\nThe second of the two incidents alluded to above was an alliance\r\nbetween England and Japan, signed on January 30, 1902. The preamble\r\nof this agreement--the first of its kind ever concluded between\r\nEngland and an Oriental power--affirmed that the contracting parties\r\nwere solely actuated by a desire to preserve the status quo and the\r\ngeneral peace of the Far East; that they were both specially\r\ninterested in maintaining the independence and territorial integrity\r\nof the empires of China and Korea, and in securing equal\r\nopportunities in these countries for all nations; that they mutually\r\nrecognized it as admissible for either of the contracting parties to\r\ntake such measures as might be indispensable to safeguard these\r\ninterests against a threat of aggressive action by any other power,\r\nor against disturbances in China or Korea, and that, if one of the\r\ncontracting parties became involved in war in defence of these\r\ninterests, the other should maintain strict neutrality and endeavour\r\nto prevent any third power from joining in hostilities against its\r\nally. Finally, should a third power join in such hostilities, then\r\nthe other contracting party promised to come to the assistance of its\r\nally, to conduct the war in common, and to make peace by mutual\r\nagreement only. The alliance was to hold good for five years from the\r\ndate of signature, but if either ally was engaged in war at such\r\ntime, the alliance was to continue until the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell upon the influence exerted by this compact\r\non the Russo-Japanese war. It kept the field clear for Japan and\r\nguaranteed her against a repetition of such a combination as that\r\nwhich must be regarded as the remote cause of the struggle.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY PHASES OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nJapan's great problem in crossing swords with Russia was to obtain a\r\nsafe avenue for her troops over the sea. Russia might at once have\r\ngained an overwhelming advantage had she seized and controlled the\r\nlines of communication between the Japanese islands and the continent\r\nof Asia. Her strategists can scarcely have failed to appreciate that\r\nfact, and would doubtless have acted accordingly had they obtained a\r\nfew months' leisure to mass an overwhelmingly strong fleet in the\r\nseas of China and Japan. They had such a fleet actually in esse; for,\r\nat the moment when war broke out, the Russian squadrons assembled in\r\nthe East, or en route thither, comprised no less than fifty-nine\r\nfighting ships, mounting 1350 guns and manned by 18,000 men. But\r\nthese figures included the Mediterranean squadron which, surprised by\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities, abandoned its journey to the Pacific.\r\nObviously, Japan's wisest course was to anticipate the combination of\r\nRussia's sea forces, and consciousness of that fact operated to\r\nhasten the current of events.\r\n\r\nPort Arthur, where the bulk of the Russian Pacific squadron lay, is\r\nsomewhat difficult of ingress and egress. On January 31, 1904, the\r\noperation of extracting the ships and parading them outside was\r\ncommenced, being brought to a conclusion on February 3rd, whereafter\r\nthe squadron steamed out to sea, and, having made a short cruise off\r\nthe coast of the Shantung promontory, returned to its position on the\r\nfollowing day. The fleet taking part in this manoeuvre consisted of\r\ntwenty-six ships, and the whole Russian naval force then in eastern\r\nAsia comprised seven battle-ships, four armoured cruisers, seven\r\nprotected cruisers, four gunboats, six sloops, twenty-five\r\ndestroyers, two mining transports, and fourteen first-class\r\ntorpedo-boats.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, on their side, had six battle-ships, eight armoured\r\ncruisers, thirteen protected cruisers, fourteen small cruisers,\r\nnineteen destroyers, and eighty-five torpedo-boats. This enumeration\r\nshows a numerical superiority on the Japanese side, but in fighting\r\ncapacity the two fleets were nearly equal. For, though the Russians\r\npossessed seven battle-ships to six Japanese, the latter had better\r\ngun-protection and greater weight of broadside fire than the former;\r\nand though Japan could muster eight armoured cruisers against\r\nRussia's four, the latter were supplemented by five protected\r\ncruisers which ranked far above anything of the same class on the\r\nJapanese side.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST NAVAL OPERATION\r\n\r\nWhen the Russian ships returned on the 4th of February from their\r\ncruise off the Shantung promontory, they took up their stations\r\noutside Port Arthur, all the harbour lights and beacons being left in\r\nposition, and no special precaution being taken except that a patrol\r\nof three torpedo-boats was sent out. Yet the Russians should have\r\nappreciated the presence of danger. For, on the 6th of February,\r\nJapan had broken off the negotiations in St. Petersburg, and had\r\ngiven official information of her intention to take measures for\r\nprotecting her menaced interests. That signified war and nothing but\r\nwar, and the \"Official Messenger\" of the same evening published the\r\nintimation, which was immediately communicated to Admiral Alexieff at\r\nPort Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe Russian fleet was then divided into three squadrons. The largest\r\nbody lay off Port Arthur, and two very much smaller squadrons were\r\nposted, one at Chemulpo on the west coast of Korea, and another at\r\nVladivostok. It is obvious that such division of the fleet on the eve\r\nof hostilities should have been carefully avoided. The ships should\r\nall have been held together with an extensive network of scouts so as\r\nto enable them swiftly and strongly to fall upon any Japanese\r\ntransports carrying troops to the mainland, or to meet effectually\r\nand crush any attempt of the Japanese squadrons to obtain command of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 8th-9th, three Japanese squadrons of\r\ndestroyers, aggregating ten vessels, steamed across a calm, moonlit\r\nsea and delivered a torpedo attack on the Russian squadron at Port\r\nArthur, the result being that the battle-ships Retvisan and\r\nTsarevitch together with the cruiser Pallada were holed. These\r\nbattle-ships were the most powerful vessels in the Russian squadron,\r\nand the Pallada was a first-class protected cruiser of 6630 tons'\r\ndisplacement. The Japanese destroyers had left Sasebo on the 6th of\r\nFebruary and they returned thither uninjured, having materially\r\nweakened the Russian fleet. On the day following this surprise,\r\nAdmiral Togo, the Japanese commander-in-chief, engaged the remains of\r\nthe Russian squadron with the heavy guns of his battle-ships at a\r\nrange of eight thousand yards, and succeeded in inflicting some\r\ninjury on the battle-ship Poltava, the protected cruisers Diana and\r\nAskold, and a second-class cruiser Novik. The Russians ultimately\r\nretreated towards the harbour with the intention of drawing the\r\nJapanese under closer fire of the land batteries, but the Japanese\r\nfleet declined to follow after them, and, instead, steamed away.\r\nThree days later (February 11th) another disaster overtook the\r\nRussians. The Yenisei, one of the two mining-transports included in\r\ntheir fleet, struck a mine and sank so rapidly in Talien Bay that\r\nninety-six of her crew perished. The Japanese had no part at all in\r\nthis catastrophe. It was purely accidental.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMULPO AFFAIR\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening at Port Arthur, a squadron of the\r\nJapanese navy, under Admiral Uryu, escorted a number of transports to\r\nChemulpo, the port of the Korean capital, Seoul. There the Russian\r\nprotected cruiser Variag (6500 tons) together with the gunboat\r\nKorietz and the transport Sungari were lying. It does not appear that\r\nAdmiral Uryu's prime object was to engage these Russian ships. But\r\nChemulpo having been chosen as the principal landing-place of the\r\nJapanese army corps which was to operate in Korea, it was, of course,\r\nimperative that the harbour should be cleared of Russian war-vessels.\r\nOn February 8th, the Russians at Chemulpo were surprised by a summons\r\nfrom Admiral Uryu to leave the port or undergo bombardment at their\r\nanchorage. The vessels stood out bravely to sea, and after an\r\nengagement lasting thirty-five minutes at ranges varying from five to\r\nten thousand yards, they were so badly injured that they returned to\r\nthe port and were sunk by their own crews, together with the\r\ntransport Sungari. The moral effect of the destruction of these\r\nvessels was incalculable.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF WAR\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February, the Czar and the Mikado respectively issued\r\ndeclarations of war. The former laid stress upon Russia's pacific\r\nintentions in proposing revision of the agreements already existing\r\nbetween the two empires with regard to Korean affairs, and accused\r\nthe Japanese of making a sudden attack on the Russian squadron at\r\nPort Arthur \"without previously notifying that the rupture of\r\ndiplomatic relations implied the beginning of warlike action.\" The\r\nJapanese declaration insisted that the integrity of Korea was a\r\nmatter of the gravest concern to Japan, inasmuch as the separate\r\nexistence of the former was essential to the safety of the latter,\r\nand charged that \"Russia, in disrespect of her solemn treaty pledges\r\nto China and of her repeated assurances to other powers, was still in\r\noccupation of Manchuria, had consolidated and strengthened her hold\r\nupon those provinces, and was bent upon their final annexation.\" With\r\nregard to Russia's accusation against Japan of drawing the sword\r\nwithout due notice, a distinguished British publicist made the\r\nfollowing comment in the columns of The Times (London):\r\n\r\n\"Far from thinking the Japanese attack on the night of February 8th,\r\ntwo full days after the announcement of the intention to take action,\r\nwas an exception to, or a deviation from, tradition and precedent, we\r\nshould rather count ourselves fortunate if our enemy, in the next\r\nnaval war we have to wage, does not strike two days before blazoning\r\nforth his intention, instead of two days after. The tremendous and\r\ndecisive results of success for the national cause are enough to\r\nbreak down all the restraining influences of the code of\r\ninternational law and Christian morality.\"\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MILITARY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when war became inevitable, the problem of absorbing\r\ninterest was to determine Russia's strategy, and it was ultimately\r\nseen that the two main groups of her forces were to be posted at Port\r\nArthur and on the Yalu; the latter to resist an advance from Korea,\r\nand the former to defend the Liaotung peninsula, which constituted\r\nthe key of the Russian position. Between the mouth of the Yalu and\r\nthe Liaotung peninsula, a distance of 120 miles, there were many\r\npoints where raiding parties might have been landed to cut the\r\nRussian railway. Against this danger, flying squadrons of Cossacks\r\nwere employed. After the destruction of the three Russian vessels in\r\nChemulpo and the crippling of the Port Arthur squadron, Japanese\r\ntransports entered the former port and quietly landed some three\r\nthousand troops, which advanced immediately upon Seoul and took\r\npossession of it.\r\n\r\nFrom that time there could be no doubt that the intention of the\r\nJapanese was to make their first attack upon the enemy by marching up\r\nthe Korean peninsula, and that the capital of Korea was chosen for a\r\nbase of operations because of climatic considerations. Chemulpo,\r\nhowever, was not the only landing-place. Fusan also served for that\r\npurpose, as subsequently did also Chinnampo, an inlet on the west\r\ncoast of the peninsula. The distance from the port of Fusan to the\r\nYalu River is four hundred miles, in round numbers, and the roads are\r\nvery bad throughout the whole country. Hence the advance of the\r\nJapanese, which was made in a leisurely manner with the utmost\r\ncircumspection and attention to detail, involved so much time that\r\nApril had drawn to its close before the troops deployed on the banks\r\nof the Yalu. They consisted of three divisions constituting an army\r\ncorps, and each division had a ration-strength of 19,000 men with a\r\ncombatant strength of 14,000 sabres and rifles and thirty-six\r\nfield-guns. It may be assumed, therefore, that when the Japanese\r\nFirst Army under General (afterwards Count) Kuroki reached the Yalu,\r\nit had a fighting-strength of between forty and fifty thousand men.\r\nThere had practically been no collision during the interval of the\r\nadvance from the southern extremity of the peninsula to its northern\r\nboundary. It is true that, on March 28th, a squadron of Cossacks\r\nattempted to surprise the Japanese cavalry at Chong-ju, but the essay\r\nproved a failure, and the Cossacks were driven back upon Wiju, which\r\nthey evacuated without any further struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Russian plan of operations did not originally contemplate a\r\nserious stand at the Yalu. The idea was to retire gradually, drawing\r\nthe Japanese into Manchuria towards the railway, and engaging them in\r\nthe exceedingly difficult country crowned by the Motien Mountains.\r\nBut at the last moment General Kuropatkin, Russian commander-in-chief\r\nin Manchuria, issued orders to General Sassulitch, commander of the\r\nSecond Siberian Army Corps, to hold the line of the Yalu with all his\r\nstrength. Sassulitch could muster for this purpose only five\r\nregiments and one battalion of infantry; forty field-guns; eight\r\nmachine-guns, and some Cossacks--twenty thousand combatants,\r\napproximately. Kuroki disposed his troops so that their front\r\nextended some twenty miles along the Yalu, the centre being at\r\nKiuliencheng, a walled town standing about 180 feet above the river.\r\nFrom this point southward, the right, or Manchurian, bank has a\r\nconsiderable command over the left, and at Kiuliencheng a tributary\r\nstream, called the Ai, joins the main river, \"which thenceforth\r\nwidens from 4000 to 7000 yards and runs in three channels between the\r\nislands and the mainland. The central channel is navigable by small\r\ncraft, and the other channels are fordable waist-deep. The Ai River\r\nis also fordable in many places during the spring.\" On the right bank\r\nof the Yalu, at the point of its junction with the Ai, the ground\r\nrises so as to command the position taken by the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Japanese commander was to threaten an attack on the\r\nlower radius of the river; to throw two divisions against\r\nKiuliencheng, and to use the remaining division in a wide flanking\r\nmovement, crossing the river higher up. The battle took place on\r\nSunday, the 1st of May. During the preceding nights, the Japanese\r\nplaced a strong force of artillery in cleverly masked batteries, and\r\nunder cover of these guns, threw seven bridges across the river, the\r\nhighest upstream being thirteen miles above Kiuliencheng and the\r\nlower two being directed to the centre of the Russian position.\r\nGeneral Kuroki then telegraphed to Tokyo that he proposed to attack\r\nat dawn on Sunday, his plan being to march one division across the\r\nfords of the Ai River, and to employ the other two, one in crumpling\r\nup the Russian left, the other in attacking Antung, where a large\r\nRussian force was in position. This programme was accurately carried\r\nout. The Japanese infantry forded the Ai breast-deep, and, swarming\r\nup the heights, drove the Russians from these strong positions.\r\nMeanwhile, the Japanese guards' division had crossed on the left and\r\ndirected its march upon Antung, while the remaining division had\r\ncompletely turned the Russian left flank. The fiercest struggle\r\noccurred at Homutang, where a Russian regiment and a battery of\r\nartillery made a splendid stand to save their comrades at Antung from\r\nbeing cut off.\r\n\r\nThe casualties on the Japanese side were 318 killed, including five\r\nofficers, and 783 wounded, including thirty-three officers. The\r\nRussian casualties numbered 1363 killed and 613 prisoners, but the\r\ndetail of wounded was not published. The Japanese captured twenty-one\r\nquick-firing field-guns, eight machine-guns, 1021 rifles and a\r\nquantity of ammunition, etc. The moral result of this battle can\r\nhardly be overestimated. It had never been seriously believed in\r\nEurope that a Russian army could be conquered by a Japanese in a fair\r\nfight, and probably that incredulity influenced Kuropatkin when he\r\nordered Sassulitch to defy strategical principles by attempting to\r\nhold a radically defective position against a greatly superior force.\r\nIn a moment, the Japanese were crowned with military laurels and\r\nplaced on a pedestal for the world to admire. But the Japanese\r\nthemselves were not deceived. They saw clearly that the contest had\r\nbeen between six battalions of Russians and two divisions of\r\nJapanese, a disparity of strength amply sufficient to account for the\r\nresult in any circumstances.\r\n\r\nNAVAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nDuring the period of eleven weeks immediately subsequent to the\r\nbattle of the Yalu, there were no military operations of a striking\r\ncharacter. Japan was preparing to despatch a second army to\r\nManchuria, and pending its shipment the chief duty to be discharged\r\ndevolved upon the fleet, namely, the further crippling of the Port\r\nArthur squadron in order to secure the transports against its\r\nenterprises. The object was promoted on the 13th of April by the loss\r\nof the Russian battle-ship Petropavlovsk. She struck one of the mines\r\nlaid by the Japanese and sank in a few minutes, carrying the Russian\r\nadmiral, Makaroff, together with about six hundred sailors, to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThis event, although it materially weakened the Port Arthur squadron,\r\nhad nothing to do with the fixed programme of Admiral Togo, which\r\nprogramme was to block the narrow channel forming the entrance of\r\nPort Arthur by sinking merchant vessels in the fairway. Three\r\nattempts to accomplish this were made. The first was on February\r\n24th; the second, on March 2nd-3rd. In the first essay, five steamers\r\nwere employed, their crews consisting of seventy-seven volunteers.\r\nThey failed. On the second occasion four steamers of at least two\r\nthousand tons each were sent in under the orders of Commander Hirose.\r\nOn this occasion, again, the steamers failed to reach vital points in\r\nthe channel, and their experience alone remained to compensate the\r\nloss of many lives. These two attempts were watched by the public\r\nwith keen interest and high admiration. The courage and coolness\r\ndisplayed by officers and men alike elicited universal applause. But\r\nit was generally believed that the successful prosecution of such a\r\ndesign was impossible and that no further essay would be made. The\r\nJapanese, however, are not easily deterred. On the night of May 2nd,\r\neight steamers, aggregating some 17,000 tons, were driven into the\r\nchannel in the face of mines, batteries, and torpedoes, and five of\r\nthem reached their allotted positions, so that the blocking of the\r\nharbour for the passage of large vessels was accomplished. The list\r\nof casualties proved very heavy. Out of 159 persons only eight\r\nofficers and thirty-six men returned unhurt. The whole of the\r\nremainder, including twenty officers, were killed, wounded, or\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nLANDING OF THE SECOND ARMY\r\n\r\nOn the very night after the accomplishment of this third blocking\r\noperation, a second Japanese army commenced to land at Pitszewo,\r\neastward of the Liaotung peninsula. This was precisely the point\r\nchosen for a similar purpose by the Japanese in the war with China,\r\nten years previously, and such close adherence to the former\r\nprogramme was condemned by some critics, especially as transports\r\ncannot get close to the shore at Pitszewo, but have to lie four miles\r\ndistant, the intervening space consisting, for the most part, of mud\r\nflats. But the Japanese were perfectly familiar with every inch of\r\nthe coast from the mouth of the Yalu to Port Arthur, and had the\r\nRussian commanders possessed equally accurate knowledge, they would\r\nhave recognized that Pitszewo was designated by natural features as\r\nthe best available landing-place, and knowing that, they might have\r\nmade effective dispositions to oppose the Japanese there, whereas ten\r\nthousand men had been put on shore before any suspicion seems to have\r\nbeen roused in the Russian camp.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF KINCHOU\r\n\r\nAfter its landing at Pitszewo, on May 5th and the following days, the\r\nSecond Japanese Army, consisting of three divisions under General\r\n(afterwards Count) Oku, pushed westward, driving away the Russian\r\ndetachments in the vicinity and securing the control of the Port\r\nArthur railway. Then, at Kinchou, on the 26th of May, a great battle\r\nwas fought. A little south of Kinchou lies a narrow neck of land\r\nconnecting the Kwangtung promontory with the mainland. It is a neck\r\nonly a mile and three-quarters broad, having Kinchou Bay on the\r\nnorthwest and Hand Bay on the southeast. On each side the ground near\r\nthe sea is low, but along the centre of the neck a ridge rises, which\r\nculminates in a point about 350 feet above the sea. This point is\r\nknown as Nanshan, and its commanding position is such that an army\r\nholding it blocks all access to the Kwangtung peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe problem for the Japanese was to obtain possession of this neck as\r\nthe sole road of access to Port Arthur; while General Stossel, who\r\ncommanded the Russian troops, knew that if the neck fell into\r\nJapanese hands, Port Arthur would become unapproachable by land. \"The\r\nNanshan position offered unusual advantages for defence, and had been\r\ndiligently prepared for permanent occupation during many weeks. Ten\r\nforts of semi-permanent character had been built, and their armament\r\nshowed that, on this occasion, the Russian artillery was vastly\r\nsuperior, both in calibre and in range, to the Japanese guns. Forts,\r\ntrenches, and rifle-pits, covered by mines and wire entanglements,\r\nwere constructed on every point of vantage and in separate tiers.\r\nSearchlights were also employed, and every advantage was taken of the\r\nproximity of a great fortress and its ample plant.\"*\r\n\r\n*The War in the Far East, by the Military Correspondent of \"The\r\nTimes.\"\r\n\r\nIt will occur to the reader that war-vessels might have been\r\nadvantageously used for the attack and defence of such a position,\r\nand, as a matter of fact, Russian gunboats manoeuvred in Hand Bay on\r\nthe southeastern shore of the neck. But, on the western side, the\r\nshoal waters of Kinchou Bay prevented access by Japanese vessels in\r\nthe face of the heavy batteries erected by the Russians on dominating\r\nsites. This splendid position was held by a Russian army mustering\r\nten thousand strong with fifty siege-guns and sixteen quick-firers. A\r\nfrontal attack seemed suicidal but was deliberately chosen. At\r\ndaybreak the battle commenced, and, after sixteen hours of incessant\r\nfighting, a Japanese infantry force turned the left flank of the\r\nRussian line and the day was won. Over seven hundred Russian dead\r\nwere buried by the Japanese, and into the latter's hands fell\r\nsixty-eight cannon of all calibres with ten machine-guns. The\r\nJapanese casualties totalled 4912.\r\n\r\nThis battle finally solved the problem as to whether Japanese\r\ninfantry could hold its own against Russian. \"With almost everything\r\nin its favour, a strong, fresh, and confident Russian army, solidly\r\nentrenched behind almost inaccessible fortifications and supported by\r\na formidable and superior artillery, was, in a single day, fairly\r\nswept out of its trenches.\"* The victorious Japanese pressed forward\r\nrapidly, and on the 30th of May obtained possession of Dalny, a base\r\npresenting incalculable advantages for the prosecution of an attack\r\nupon Port Arthur, which fortress it was now evident that the Japanese\r\nhad determined to capture.\r\n\r\n*The War in the Far East, by the Military Correspondent of \"The\r\nTimes.\"\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF TELISSU\r\n\r\nTo have left the Japanese in undisturbed possession of the neck of\r\nthe Liaotung peninsula would have been to abandon Port Arthur to its\r\nfate. On the other hand, the Russians ought not to have entertained\r\nany hope of their own ability to carry such a position by assault\r\nafter they had signally failed to hold it in the face of attack.\r\nNevertheless, finding it intolerable, alike to their prestige and to\r\ntheir sense of camaraderie, to take no measure in behalf of the great\r\nfortress and its thirty thousand defenders, they determined to march\r\nat once to its assistance. To that end celerity was all important,\r\nand on June 14th, that is to say, only eighteen days after the battle\r\nof Kinchou, a Russian army of some thirty-five thousand combatants,\r\nunder the command of General Baron Stackelberg, moving down the\r\nrailway to recover Kinchou and Nanshan, came into collision with the\r\nJapanese and fought the battle of Telissu. The Russian general,\r\nclinging always to the railway, advanced with such a restricted front\r\nthat the Japanese, under General Oku, outflanked him, and he was\r\ndriven back with a loss of about ten thousand, killed and wounded,\r\nfourteen guns, and four hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\nNAVAL INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nOn June 15th, the very day after the Telissu victory, the Japanese\r\nmet their only naval catastrophe. While their fleet was watching the\r\nenemy off Port Arthur, the battleships Hatsuse and Yashima struck\r\nmines and sank immediately. Moreover, on the same day, the cruisers\r\nKasuga and Yoshino collided in a dense fog, and the latter vessel was\r\nsent to the bottom. As the Japanese possessed only six battle-ships,\r\nthe loss of two was a serious blow, and might have emboldened the\r\nRussians to despatch a squadron from the Baltic to take the earliest\r\npossible advantage of this incident. Foreseeing this, the Japanese\r\ntook care to conceal the loss of the Hatsuse and Yashima, and the\r\nfact did not become known until after the battle of Tsushima, a year\r\nlater, when the Russian fleet had been practically annihilated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Russian squadron at Vladivostok had accomplished\r\nlittle. This squadron consisted originally of three armoured\r\ncruisers, Gromovoi, Rossia, and Rurik, with one protected cruiser,\r\nBogatyr. But the last-named ship ran on a rock near Vladivostok and\r\nbecame a total wreck in the middle of May, a month marked by many\r\nheavy losses. These cruisers made several excursions into the Sea of\r\nJapan, sinking or capturing a few Japanese merchantmen, and cleverly\r\nevading a Japanese squadron under Admiral Kamimura, detailed to watch\r\nthem. But their only achievement of practical importance was the\r\ndestruction of two large Japanese transports, the Hitachi Maru and\r\nthe Sado Maru. In achieving this feat the Russians appeared off\r\nTsushima in the Straits of Korea, on June 15th, and the transports\r\nwhich they sunk or disabled carried heavy guns for the bombardment of\r\nPort Arthur.\r\n\r\nOf course, nothing was publicly known about the cargo of the Hitachi\r\nand her consort, but there could be no question that, in timing their\r\nattack with such remarkable accuracy, the Russians must have obtained\r\nsecret information as to the movements of the transports and the\r\nnature of their cargo. Considerable criticism was uttered against\r\nAdmiral Kamimura for failure to get into touch with the Vladivostok\r\nvessels during such a long interval. But much of the censure was\r\nsuperficial. Kamimura redeemed his reputation on the 14th of August\r\nwhen, in a running fight between Fusan and Vladivostok, the Rurik was\r\nsunk and the Gromovoi and Rossia were so seriously damaged as to be\r\nunable to take any further part in the war. On this occasion six\r\nhundred Russians were rescued by the Japanese from the sinking Rurik,\r\nand it was noted at the time that the Russians had made no attempt to\r\nsave Japanese life at the sinking of the Hitachi Maru.\r\n\r\nTHE JAPANESE FORCES\r\n\r\nImmediately after the landing of the army corps under General Oku and\r\nthe capture of Dalny in the sequel of the battle of Kinchou, the\r\nJapanese began to pour troops into Dalny, and soon they had there\r\nthree divisions under the command of General (afterwards Count) Nogi.\r\nThis force was henceforth known as the Third Army, that of General\r\nKuroki being the First, and that under General Oku, the Second. The\r\nnext operation was to land another army at Takushan, which lies on\r\nthe south coast of Manchuria, between Pitszewo and the estuary of the\r\nYalu. This army was under the command of General (afterwards Count)\r\nNozu, and its purpose was to fill the gap between the First Army and\r\nthe Second. Nozu's corps thus became the Fourth Army. In fact, the\r\nJapanese repeated, in every respect, the plan of campaign pursued by\r\nthem ten years previously in the war with China.\r\n\r\nThere was one ultimate difference, however. In the latter war, the\r\nforce which captured Port Arthur was subsequently carried oversea to\r\nthe Shantung province, where it assaulted and took the great Chinese\r\nnaval port at Weihaiwei. But the army sent against Port Arthur, in\r\n1904, was intended to march up the Liaotung peninsula after the\r\ncapture of the fortress, so, as to fall into line with the other\r\nthree armies and to manoeuvre on their left flank during the general\r\nadvance northward. Thus considered, the plan of campaign suggests\r\nthat General Nogi and his three divisions were expected to capture\r\nPort Arthur without much delay, and indeed their early operations\r\nagainst the fortress were conducted on that hypothesis. But, as a\r\nmatter of fact, in spite of heroic efforts and unlimited bravery on\r\nthe Japanese side, Port Arthur, with its garrison of thirty thousand\r\nmen, its splendid fortifications, and its powerful artillery, backed\r\nby the indomitable resolution and stubborn resistance of Russian\r\nsoldiers, did not fall until the last day of 1904, and Nogi's army\r\nwas unable to take part in the great field-battles which marked the\r\nadvance of the three other Japanese armies from the seacoast to the\r\ncapital of Manchuria.\r\n\r\nStep by step, however, though at heavy sacrifice of life, the\r\nJapanese fought their way through the outer lines of the Russian\r\ndefences, and the end of July saw the besiegers in such a position\r\nthat they were able to mount guns partly commanding the anchorage\r\nwithin the port. An intolerable situation being thus created for the\r\nRussian squadron, it determined to put to sea, and on August 10th\r\nthis was attempted. Without entering into details of the fight that\r\nensued, it will suffice to state briefly that the result of the\r\nsortie was to deprive the Russian squadron of the services of one\r\nbattle-ship, three cruisers, and five torpedo craft, leaving to\r\nRear-Admiral Prince Ukhtonsky, who commanded the vessels in Port\r\nArthur, only five battle-ships, two cruisers (of which one was\r\ninjured), and three destroyers. On August 18th, a gunboat; on August\r\n23d, another battle-ship, and on August 24th another destroyer were\r\nsunk or disabled by striking Japanese mines, and it may be said\r\nbriefly that the Russian squadron thenceforth ceased to be a menace\r\nto the Japanese, and that only the land forces had to be counted\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nFIELD OPERATIONS PRIOR TO BATTLE OF LIAOYANG\r\n\r\nBy the close of June the three Japanese armies under Generals Kuroki,\r\nNozu, and Oku were fully deployed and ready to advance in unison. The\r\ntask before them was to clear the Russians from the littoral of the\r\nKorean Sea and force them through the mountains of Manchuria into the\r\nvalley of the Liao River. In these operations the Japanese acted\r\nuniformly on the offensive, whereas the Russians occupied positions\r\ncarefully chosen and strictly fortified, where they stood always on\r\nthe defensive. Five heavy engagements, beginning with Fenshuiling on\r\nthe 26th of June and ending with Yangtzuling on July 31st, were\r\nfought in these circumstances, and in every instance the Japanese\r\nemerged victorious. From the commencement of the land campaign until\r\nthe end of July the invading army's casualties were 12,000, while the\r\nRussian losses, exclusive of those at Port Arthur, aggregated 28,000\r\nkilled and wounded, and 113 light siege-and field-guns, together with\r\neighteen machine-guns, captured.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF LIAOYANG\r\n\r\nThe first great phase of the field-operations may be said to have\r\nterminated with the battle of Liaoyang, which commenced on August\r\n25th and continued almost without interruption for nine days,\r\nterminating on the 3rd of September. In this historic contest the\r\nRussians had 220,000 men engaged. They were deployed over a front of\r\nabout forty miles, every part of which had been entrenched and\r\nfortified with the utmost care and ingenuity. In fact, the position\r\nseemed impregnable, and as the Japanese could muster only some\r\n200,000 men for the attack, their chances of success appeared very\r\nsmall. Desperate fighting ensued, but no sensible impression could be\r\nmade on the Russian lines, and finally, as a last resource, a strong\r\nforce of Kuroki's army was sent across the Taitsz River to turn the\r\nenemy's left flank. The Russian general, Kuropatkin, rightly\r\nestimated that the troops detached by General Kuroki for this purpose\r\nwere not commensurate with the task assigned to them, whereas the\r\nRussians could meet this flanking movement with overwhelming\r\nstrength. Therefore, Kuropatkin sent three army corps across the\r\nriver, and by September 1st, the Japanese flanking forces were\r\nconfronted by a powerful body.\r\n\r\nStrategists are agreed that, had Kuropatkin's plans found competent\r\nagents to execute them, the Japanese advance would have been at least\r\nchecked at Liaoyang. In fact, the Japanese, in drafting their\r\noriginal programme, had always expected that Nogi's army would be in\r\na position on the left flank in the field long before there was any\r\nquestion of fighting at Liaoyang. It was thus due to the splendid\r\ndefence made by the garrison of the great fortress that Kuropatkin\r\nfound himself in such a favourable position at the end of August. But\r\nunfortunately for the Russians, one of their generals, Orloff, who\r\nhad thirteen battalions under his command, showed incompetence, and\r\nfalling into an ambuscade in the course of the counter-flanking\r\noperation, suffered defeat with heavy losses. The Japanese took full\r\nadvantage of this error, and Kuropatkin, with perhaps excessive\r\ncaution, decided to abandon his counter-movement and withdraw from\r\nLiaoyang. He effected his retreat in a manner that bore testimony to\r\nthe excellence of his generalship. The casualties in this great\r\nbattle were very heavy. From August 25th, when the preliminary\r\noperations may be said to have commenced, to September 3rd, when the\r\nfield remained in the possession of the Japanese, their losses were\r\n17,539, namely, 4866 in the First Army, 4992 in the Fourth, and 7681\r\nin the Second, while the Russian casualties were estimated at 25,000.\r\n\r\nBATTLES OF SHAHO AND OF HEIKAUTAI\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of October, General Kuropatkin issued from his\r\nheadquarters in Mukden an order declaring that the \"moment for the\r\nattack, ardently desired by the army, had at last arrived, and that\r\nthe Japanese were now to be compelled to do Russia's will.\" Barely a\r\nmonth had elapsed since the great battle at Liaoyang, and it still\r\nremains uncertain what had happened in that interval to justify the\r\nissue of such an order. But the most probable explanation is that\r\nKuropatkin had received re-enforcements, so that he could marshal\r\n250,000 to 260,000 troops for the proposed offensive, and that his\r\nnews from Port Arthur suggested the necessity of immediate and\r\nstrenuous efforts to relieve the fortress. His plan was to throw\r\nforward his right so as to outflank the Japanese, recover possession\r\nof Liaoyang, and obtain command of the railway.\r\n\r\nHe set his troops in motion on the 9th of October, but he was driven\r\nback after more than a week's fighting. No less than 13,333 Russian\r\ndead were left on the field, and at the lowest calculation,\r\nKuropatkin's casualties must have exceeded 60,000 men exclusive of\r\nprisoners. There can be no doubt whatever that the Russian army had\r\nsuffered one of the most overwhelming defeats in its history, and\r\nthat after a fortnight's hard marching and nine days' hard fighting,\r\nwith little food or sleep, it had been reduced by terrible losses and\r\ndepressing fatigues to a condition bordering on extermination. Such\r\nwas the result of Kuropatkin's first attempt to assume the offensive.\r\nThereafter, fully three months of complete inaction ensued, and the\r\nonlooking world occupied itself with conjectures as to the\r\nexplanation of this apparent loss of time.\r\n\r\nYet the chief reason was very simple. The weather in central\r\nManchuria at the close of the year is such as to render military\r\nmanoeuvres almost impossible on a large scale, and this difficulty is\r\ngreatly accentuated by the almost complete absence of roads. In fact,\r\nthe reasons which induced Kuropatkin to defy these obstacles, and\r\nrenew his outflanking attempts after the beginning of the cold\r\nweather, have never been fully explained. The most probable theory is\r\nthat held by Japanese strategists, namely, that he desired to find\r\nsome opening for the vigorous campaign which he intended to pursue in\r\nthe spring, and that his attention was naturally directed to the\r\nregion between the Hun and the Liao rivers, a region unoccupied by\r\neither army and yet within striking distance of the bases of both.\r\nMoreover, he had received nearly three whole divisions from Europe,\r\nand he looked to these fresh troops with much confidence. He set his\r\nforces in motion on the 25th of January, 1905. Seven Russian\r\ndivisions were engaged, and the brunt of the fighting was borne by\r\ntwo Japanese divisions and a brigade of cavalry. Two other divisions\r\nwere engaged, but the part they acted in the fight was so subordinate\r\nthat it need scarcely be taken into account. The Russians were\r\nfinally driven back with a loss of some twenty thousand killed,\r\nwounded, or prisoners. This battle of Heikautai was the last\r\nengagement that took place before the final encounter.\r\n\r\nPORT ARTHUR\r\n\r\nThe relief of Port Arthur had ceased to be an important objective of\r\nKuropatkin before he planned his Heikautai attack. The great fortress\r\nfell on the last day of 1904. It was not until the middle of May that\r\nthe Kinchou isthmus and Dalny came into Japanese hands, nor was the\r\nsiege army under General Nogi marshalled until the close of June.\r\nDuring that interval, General Stossel, who commanded, on the Russian\r\nside, availed himself of all possible means of defence, and the\r\ninvesting force had to fight for every inch of ground. The attack on\r\nthe outlying positions occupied fully a month, and not till the end\r\nof July had the Japanese advanced close enough to attempt a coup de\r\nmain. There can be no doubt that they had contemplated success by\r\nthat method of procedure, but they met with such a severe repulse,\r\nduring August, that they recognized the necessity of recourse to the\r\ncomparatively slow arts of the engineer. Thereafter, the story of the\r\nsiege followed stereotyped lines except that the colossal nature of\r\nthe fortifications entailed unprecedented sacrifice of life on the\r\nbesiegers' part. The crucial point of the siege-operations was the\r\ncapture of a position called 203-Metre Hill. This took place on\r\nNovember 30th after several days of the most terrible fighting ever\r\nwitnessed, fighting which cost the Japanese ten thousand casualties.\r\nThe importance of the hill was that it furnished a post of\r\nobservation whence indications could be given to guide the heavy\r\nJapanese artillery in its cannonade of the remaining Russian ships in\r\nthe harbour.\r\n\r\nNothing then remained for the Russians except to sink the ships, and\r\nthis they did, so that Russia lost a squadron which, all told,\r\nrepresented an outlay of over thirty millions sterling--$150,000,000.\r\nIn a telegram despatched to his own Government on January 1st,\r\nGeneral Stossel said: \"Great Sovereign, forgive! We have done all\r\nthat was humanly possible. Judge us; but be merciful. Eleven months\r\nhave exhausted our strength. A quarter only of the defenders, and\r\none-half of them invalids, occupy twenty-seven versts of\r\nfortifications without supports and without intervals for even the\r\nbriefest repose. The men are reduced to shadows!\" On the previous day\r\nStossel had written to General Nogi, declaring that further\r\nresistance would merely entail useless loss of life considering the\r\nconditions within the fortress. The total number of prisoners who\r\nsurrendered at the fall of the fortress was 878 officers and 23,491\r\nmen, and the captured material included 546 guns; 35,252 rifles; 60\r\ntorpedoes; 30,000 kilograms of powder; 82,670 rounds of\r\ngun-ammunition; two and a quarter million rounds of small-arm\r\nammunition; a number of wagons; 1,920 horses; four battle-ships; two\r\ncruisers; fourteen gunboats and torpedo-craft; ten steamers;\r\nthirty-three steam launches, and various other vessels. These figures\r\nare worthy of study, as one of General Stossel's alleged reasons for\r\nsurrendering was scarcity of ammunition.\r\n\r\nMISHCHENKO'S RAID\r\n\r\nThe capture of Port Arthur meant something more than the fall of a\r\nfortress which had been counted impregnable and which had dominated\r\nthe strategical situation for fully seven months. It meant, also,\r\nthat General Nogi's army would now be free to join their comrades\r\nbeyond the Liao River, and that Kuropatkin would find his opponents'\r\nstrength increased by four divisions. It became, therefore, important\r\nto ascertain how soon this transfer was likely to be effected, and,\r\nif possible, to interrupt it by tearing up the railway. Accordingly,\r\non January 8th, General Mishchenko's division of Cossacks,\r\nCaucasians, and Dragoons, mustering six thousand sabres, with six\r\nbatteries of light artillery, crossed the Hun River and marched south\r\non a five-mile front. Throughout the war the Cossacks, of whom a very\r\nlarge force was with the Russian army, had hitherto failed to\r\ndemonstrate their usefulness, and this raid in force was regarded\r\nwith much curiosity. It accomplished very little. Its leading\r\nsquadrons penetrated as far south as Old Niuchwang, and five hundred\r\nmetres of the railway north of Haicheng were destroyed, a bridge also\r\nbeing blown up. But this damage was speedily restored, and as for the\r\nreconnoitring results of the raid, they seem to have been very\r\ntrifling.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF MUKDEN\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Heikautai, which cost the Russians twenty\r\nthousand casualties and exposed the troops to terrible hardships,\r\nKuropatkin's army did not number more than 260,000 effectives. On the\r\nother hand, he could rely upon a constant stream of re-enforcements\r\nfrom Europe, as the efficiency of the railway service had been\r\nenormously increased by the genius and energy of Prince Khilkoff,\r\nRussian minister of Ways and Communications. In fact, when all the\r\nforces under orders for Manchuria had reached their destination,\r\nKuropatkin would have under his command twelve army corps, six\r\nrifle-brigades, and nine divisions of mounted troops, a total of\r\nsomething like half a million men. Evidently the Japanese would not\r\nhave acted wisely in patiently awaiting the coming of these troops.\r\nMoreover, since the break-up of winter would soon render temporarily\r\nimpossible all operations in the field, to have deferred any forward\r\nmovement beyond the month of March would have merely facilitated the\r\nmassing of Russian re-enforcements in the lines on the Shaho, where\r\nthe enemy had taken up his position after his defeat at Heikautai.\r\nThese considerations induced Marshal Oyama to deliver an attack with\r\nhis whole force during the second half of February, and there\r\nresulted a conflict which, under the name of the \"battle of Mukden,\"\r\nwill go down in the pages of history as the greatest fight on record.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed by the Russians that Kuropatkin was thinking of\r\nassuming the offensive when the Japanese forced his hand; but however\r\nthat may be, the fact is that he fought on the defensive as he had\r\ndone throughout the whole war with two exceptions. Nevertheless, we\r\nmay confidently assert that at no previous period had the Russians\r\nbeen so confident and so strong. According to the Japanese estimate,\r\nthe accuracy of which may be trusted, Kuropatkin had 376 battalions,\r\n171 batteries, and 178 squadrons; representing 300,000 rifles, 26,000\r\nsabres and 1368 guns, while the defences behind which these troops\r\nwere sheltered were of the most elaborate character, superior to\r\nanything that the Japanese had encountered during the previous\r\nbattles of the field-campaign. On the other hand, the Japanese also\r\nwere in unprecedented strength. Up to the battle of Heikautai,\r\nKuropatkin had been confronted by only three armies, namely, the\r\nFirst, Second, and Fourth, under Generals Kuroki, Oku, and Nozu,\r\nrespectively. In the middle of February, these numbered three, four,\r\nand two divisions, respectively. But there had now been added a\r\nconsiderable number of reserve brigades, bringing up the average\r\nstrength of most of the divisions to from 22,000 to 25,000 men.\r\nFurther, in addition to these armies, two others were in the field,\r\nnamely, the Third, under General Nogi, and the Fifth, under General\r\nKawamura. General Nogi's force had marched up from Port Arthur, but\r\nGeneral Kawamura's was a new army formed of special reservists and\r\nnow put in the field for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe Russians occupied a front forty-four miles in extent and from\r\nfive to six miles in depth. They did not know, apparently, that\r\nGeneral Kawamura's army had joined Oyama's forces, nor did they know\r\nwhere Nogi's army was operating. The Japanese programme was to hold\r\nthe Russian centre; to attack their left flank with Kawamura's army,\r\nand to sweep round their right flank with Nogi's forces. The latter\r\nwere therefore kept in the rear until Kawamura's attack had developed\r\nfully on the east and until the two centres were hotly engaged. Then\r\n\"under cover of the smoke and heat generated by the conflict of the\r\nother armies on an immense front, and specially screened by the\r\nviolent activity of the Second Army, Nogi marched in echelon of\r\ncolumns from the west on a wide, circling movement; swept up the Liao\r\nvalley, and bending thence eastward, descended on Mukden from the\r\nwest and northwest, giving the finishing blow of this gigantic\r\nencounter; severing the enemy's main line of retreat, and forcing him\r\nto choose between surrender and flight. To launch, direct, and\r\nsupport four hundred thousand men engaged at such a season over a\r\nfront one hundred miles in length was one of the most remarkable\r\ntasks ever undertaken on the field of battle by a modern staff.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, all these events did not move exactly as planned, but the\r\nmain feature of the great fight was that Kuropatkin, deceived by\r\nKawamura's movement, detached a large force to oppose him, and then\r\nrecalled these troops too late for the purpose of checking General\r\nNogi's flanking operation. The fighting was continuous for almost two\r\nweeks, and on the morning of March 16th, the Russians had been driven\r\nout of Mukden and forced northward beyond Tiehling. In fact, they did\r\nnot pause until March 20th, when Linievitch, who had succeeded\r\nKuropatkin in the chief command, was able to order a halt at\r\nSupingchieh, seventy miles to the north of Mukden. \"The Russian\r\nlosses in this most disastrous battle included, according to Marshal\r\nOyama's reports, 27,700 killed and 110,000 wounded,\" while an immense\r\nquantity of war material fell into the hands of the victors. The\r\nJapanese losses, up to the morning of March 12th, were estimated at\r\n41,222.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF TSUSHIMA\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, both sides had appreciated the enormous\r\npreponderance that would be conferred by command of the sea. It was\r\nin obedience to this conviction that the Russian authorities were in\r\nthe act of taking steps to increase largely their Pacific squadron\r\nwhen the outbreak of war compelled them to suspend the despatch of\r\nre-enforcements. They did not, however, relinquish their\r\npreparations. Evidently, any vessels sent to the scene of combat\r\nafter fighting had begun must be competent to defend themselves\r\nagainst attack, which condition entailed strength to form an\r\nindependent squadron. The preparations to acquire this competence\r\ninvolved a long delay, and it was not until the 16th of October,\r\n1904, that Admiral Rozhdestvensky left Libau with some forty ships.\r\nThe world watched this adventure with astonished eyes. Thitherto\r\nGreat Britain, equipped as she is with coaling-stations all round the\r\nglobe, had been the only power thought capable of sending a large\r\nfleet on an ocean voyage. Rozhdestvensky's squadron consumed over\r\nthree thousand tons of coal daily when steaming at a reduced speed,\r\nand how this supply was to be kept up in the absence of ports of\r\ncall, no one was able to conjecture. The difficulty was ultimately\r\novercome by the very benevolent character which the neutrality of\r\ncertain powers assumed, and in May, 1905, the Baltic squadron, as the\r\nvessels under Rozhdestvensky were called, made its appearance in Far\r\nEastern waters.\r\n\r\nIt had been supposed that the Russians would seek to envelop their\r\nmovements in obscurity, but they seem to have appreciated, from the\r\noutset, the absurdity of endeavouring to conceal the traces of a\r\nfleet of forty vessels steaming along the routes of the world's\r\ncommerce. They therefore proceeded boldly on their way, slowly but\r\nindomitably overcoming all obstacles. It will be observed that the\r\ndate of their departure from Libau was just two months after the\r\nlast attempt of the Port Arthur squadron to escape to Vladivostok.\r\nDoubtless, this sortie, which ended so disastrously for the\r\nRussians, was prompted in part by anticipation of the Baltic\r\nfleet's approaching departure, and had the Port Arthur squadron,\r\nor any considerable portion of it, reached Vladivostok before\r\nRozhdestvensky's coming, Admiral Togo might have been caught between\r\ntwo fires. The result of the sortie, however, dispelled that hope.\r\nLong before Rozhdestvensky reached the Far East, he fell into touch\r\nwith Japanese scouts, and every movement of his ships was flashed to\r\nthe enemy. That Vladivostok was his objective and that he would try\r\nto reach that place if possible without fighting, were unquestionable\r\nfacts. But by what avenue would he enter the Sea of Japan? The query\r\noccupied attention in all the capitals of the world during several\r\ndays, and conjectures were as numerous as they were conflicting. But\r\nAdmiral Togo had no moment of hesitation. He knew that only two\r\nroutes were possible, and that one of them, the Tsugaru Strait, could\r\nbe strewn with mines at very brief notice. The Russians dare not take\r\nthat risk. Therefore Togo waited quietly at his base in the Korean\r\nStrait and on the 27th of May his scouts reported by wireless\r\ntelegraphy at 5 A.M., \"Enemy's fleet sighted in 203 section. He seems\r\nto be steering for the east channel.\"\r\n\r\nIn the historic action which ensued, Rozhdestvensky had under his\r\ncommand eight battle-ships, nine cruisers, three coast-defence ships,\r\nnine destroyers, an auxiliary cruiser, six special-service steamers,\r\nand two hospital ships. Togo's fleet consisted of five battle-ships\r\n(one of them practically valueless), one coast-defence vessel, eight\r\narmoured cruisers, ten protected cruisers, twenty destroyers, and\r\nsixty-seven torpedo-boats. Numerically, the advantage was on the\r\nJapanese side, although in first-class fighting material the\r\ndisparity was not remarkable. As for the result, it can only be\r\ncalled annihilation for the Russian squadron. Out of the thirty-eight\r\nships composing it, twenty were sunk; six captured; two went to the\r\nbottom or were shattered while escaping; six were disarmed and\r\ninterned in neutral ports to which they had fled; one was released\r\nafter capture, and of one the fate is unknown. Only two escaped out\r\nof the whole squadron. This wonderful result justifies the comment of\r\na competent authority:\r\n\r\n\"We can recognize that Togo is great--great in the patience he\r\nexercised in the face of much provocation to enter upon the fight\r\nunder conditions less favourable to the success of his cause; great\r\nin his determination to give decisive battle despite advice offered\r\nto him to resort to methods of evasion, subterfuge, and finesse;\r\ngreat in his use of not one but every means in his power to crush his\r\nenemy, and great, greatest perhaps of all, in his moderation after\r\nvictory unparalleled in the annals of modern naval war.\r\n\r\n\"The attitude of the Japanese people in the presence of this\r\nepoch-making triumph is a sight for men and gods. They have the grand\r\nmanner of the ancients, and their invariable attitude throughout the\r\nwar, whether in the hour of victory or in that of disappointment, has\r\nbeen worthy of a great people. No noisy and vulgar clamour, no\r\nself-laudation, no triumph over a fallen enemy, but deep\r\nthankfulness, calm satisfaction, and reference of the cause of\r\nvictory to the illustrious virtue of their Emperor.\"*\r\n\r\n*The War in the Far East, by the Military Correspondent of \"The\r\nTimes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Japanese losses in the two-days' fighting were three\r\ntorpedo-boats, and they had 116 killed and 538 wounded.\r\n\r\nPEACE RESTORED\r\n\r\nAfter the battles of Mukden and Tsushima, which were great enough to\r\nterminate the greatest war, the Russians and the Japanese alike found\r\nthemselves in a position which must either prelude another stupendous\r\neffort on both sides or be utilized to negotiate peace. Here the\r\nPresident of the United States of America intervened, and, on the 9th\r\nof June, 1905, the American minister in Tokyo and the ambassador in\r\nSt. Petersburg, instructed from Washington, handed an identical note\r\nto the Japanese and the Russian Governments respectively, urging the\r\ntwo countries to approach each other direct. On the following day,\r\nJapan intimated her frank acquiescence, and Russia lost no time in\r\ntaking a similar step. Two months nevertheless elapsed before the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the two powers met, on August 10th, at\r\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire. Russia sent M. (afterwards Count) de Witte\r\nand Baron Rosen; Japan, Baron (afterwards Marquis) Komura, who had\r\nheld the portfolio of Foreign Affairs throughout the war, and Mr.\r\n(afterwards Baron) Takahira. The Japanese statesmen well understood\r\nthat much of the credit accruing to them for their successful conduct\r\nof the war must be forfeited in the sequel of the negotiations. For\r\nthe people of Japan had accustomed themselves to expect that Russia\r\nwould recoup a great part, if not the whole, of the expenses incurred\r\nby their country in the contest, whereas the ministry in Tokyo knew\r\nthat to look for payment of indemnity by a great State whose\r\nterritory has not been invaded effectively or its existence menaced\r\nmust be futile.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, diplomacy required that this conviction should be\r\nconcealed, and thus Russia carried to the conference a belief that\r\nthe financial phase of the discussion would be crucial. Baron\r\nKomura's mandate was, however, that the only radically essential\r\nterms were those formulated by Japan prior to the war. She must\r\ninsist on securing the ends for which she had fought, since she\r\nbelieved them to be indispensable to the peace of the Far East, but\r\nbeyond that she would not go. The Japanese plenipotentiaries,\r\ntherefore, judged it wise to submit their terms in the order of the\r\nreal importance, leaving their Russian colleagues to imagine, as they\r\nprobably would, that the converse method had been adopted, and that\r\neverything prefatory to questions of finance and territory was of\r\nminor consequence.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations, commencing on the 10th of August, were not\r\nconcluded until the 5th of September, when a treaty of peace was\r\nsigned. There had been a moment when the onlooking world believed\r\nthat unless Russia agreed to ransom the island of Saghalien by paying\r\nto Japan a sum of 120 millions sterling,--$580,000,000, the\r\nconference would be broken off. Nor did such an exchange seem\r\nunreasonable, for were Russia expelled from the northern part of\r\nSaghalien, which commands the estuary of the Amur, her position in\r\nSiberia would have been compromised. But Japan's statesmen were not\r\ndisposed to make any display of territorial aggression. The southern\r\nhalf of Saghalien had originally belonged to Japan and had passed\r\ninto Russia's possession by an arrangement which the Japanese nation\r\nstrongly resented. To recover that portion of the island seemed,\r\ntherefore, a legitimate ambition. Japan did not contemplate any\r\nlarger demand, nor did she seriously insist on an indemnity. Thus,\r\nthe negotiations were never in real danger of failure.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Portsmouth recognized Japan's \"paramount political,\r\nmilitary, and economic interests\" in Korea; provided for the\r\nsimultaneous evacuation of Manchuria by the contracting parties;\r\ntransferred to Japan the lease of the Liaotung peninsula, held by\r\nRussia from China, together with that of the Russian railways south\r\nof Kwanchengtsz and all collateral mining or other privileges; ceded\r\nto Japan the southern half of Saghalien, the fiftieth parallel of\r\nlatitude to be the boundary between the two parties; secured\r\nfishing-rights for Japanese subjects along the coasts of the seas of\r\nJapan, Okhotsk, and Bering; laid down that the expense incurred by\r\nthe Japanese for the maintenance of the Russian prisoners during the\r\nwar should be reimbursed by Russia, less the outlays made by the\r\nlatter on account of Japanese prisoners, by which arrangement Japan\r\nobtained a payment of some four million sterling $20,000,000, and\r\nprovided that the contracting parties, while withdrawing their\r\nmilitary force from Manchuria, might maintain guards to protect their\r\nrespective railways, the number of such guards not to exceed fifteen\r\nper kilometre of line. There were other important restrictions:\r\nfirst, the contracting parties were to abstain from taking, on the\r\nRusso-Korean frontier, any military measures which might menace the\r\nsecurity of Russian or Korean territory; secondly, the two powers\r\npledged themselves not to exploit the Manchurian railways for\r\nstrategic purposes, and thirdly, they promised not to build on\r\nSaghalien or its adjacent islands any fortifications or other similar\r\nworks, or to take any military measures which might impede the free\r\nnavigation of the Strait of La Pérouse and the Gulf of Tatary.\r\n\r\nThe above provisions concerned the two contracting parties only. But\r\nChina's interests also were considered. Thus, it was agreed to\r\n\"restore entirely and completely to her exclusive administration\" all\r\nportions of Manchuria then in the occupation, or under the control,\r\nof Japanese or Russian troops, except the leased territory; that her\r\nconsent must be obtained for the transfer to Japan of the leases and\r\nconcessions held by the Russians in Manchuria; that the Russian\r\nGovernment should disavow the possession of \"any territorial\r\nadvantages or preferential or exclusive concessions in impairment of\r\nChinese sovereignty or inconsistent with the principle of equal\r\nopportunity in Manchuria,\" and that Japan and Russia \"engaged\r\nreciprocally not to obstruct any general measures common to all\r\ncountries which China might take for the development of the commerce\r\nand industry of Manchuria.\"\r\n\r\nThis distinction between the special interests of the contracting\r\nparties and the interests of China herself, as well as of foreign\r\nnations generally, is essential to clear understanding of a situation\r\nwhich subsequently attracted much attention. From the time of the\r\nOpium War (1857) to the Boxer rising (1900), each of the great\r\nWestern powers struggled for its own hand in China, and each sought\r\nto gain for itself exclusive concessions and privileges with\r\ncomparatively little regard for the interests of others and with no\r\nregard whatsoever for China's sovereign rights. The fruits of this\r\nperiod were permanently ceded territories (Hongkong and Macao);\r\nleases temporarily establishing foreign sovereignty in various\r\ndistricts (Kiao-chou, Weihaiwei, and Kwang-chow); railway and mining\r\nconcessions, and the establishment of settlements at open ports where\r\nforeign jurisdiction was supreme. But when, in 1900, the Boxer rising\r\nforced all the powers into a common camp, they awoke to full\r\nappreciation of a principle which had been growing current for the\r\npast two or three years, namely, that concerted action on the lines\r\nof maintaining China's integrity and securing to all alike equality\r\nof opportunity and a similarly open door, was the only feasible\r\nmethod of preventing the partition of the Chinese empire and averting\r\na clash of rival interests which might have disastrous results. This,\r\nof course, did not mean that there was to be any abandonment of\r\nspecial privileges already acquired or any surrender of existing\r\nconcessions. The arrangement was not to be retrospective in any\r\nsense. Vested interests were to be strictly guarded until the lapse\r\nof the periods for which they had been granted, or until the maturity\r\nof China's competence to be really autonomous.\r\n\r\nA curious situation was thus created. International professions of\r\nrespect for China's sovereignty, for the integrity of her empire, and\r\nfor the enforcement of the open door and equal opportunity co-existed\r\nwith legacies from an entirely different past. Russia endorsed this\r\nnew policy, but not unnaturally declined to abate any of the\r\nadvantages previously enjoyed by her in Manchuria. Those advantages\r\nwere very substantial. They included a twenty-five-year lease--with\r\nprovision for renewal--of the Liaotung peninsula, within which area\r\nof 1220 square miles Chinese troops might not penetrate, whereas\r\nRussia would not only exercise full administrative authority, but\r\nalso take military and naval action of any kind; they included\r\nthe creation of a neutral territory on the immediate north of the\r\nformer and still more extensive, which remained under Chinese\r\nadministration, and where neither Chinese nor Russian troops might\r\nenter, nor might China, without Russia's consent, cede land, open\r\ntrading marts, or grant concessions to any third nationality; and\r\nthey included the right to build some sixteen hundred miles of\r\nrailway (which China would have the opportunity of purchasing at cost\r\nprice in the year 1938, and would be entitled to receive gratis in\r\n1982), as well as the right to hold extensive zones on either side of\r\nthe railway, to administer these zones in the fullest sense, and to\r\nwork all mines lying along the lines.\r\n\r\nUnder the Portsmouth treaty these advantages were transferred to\r\nJapan by Russia, the railway, however, being divided so that only the\r\nportion (521.5 miles) to the south of Kwanchengtsz fell to Japan's\r\nshare, while the portion (1077 miles) to the north of that place\r\nremained in Russia's hands. China's consent to the above transfers\r\nand assignments was obtained in a treaty signed at Peking on the 22nd\r\nof December, 1905. Thus, Japan came to hold in Manchuria a position\r\nsomewhat contradictory. On the one hand, she figured as the champion\r\nof the Chinese empire's integrity and as an exponent of the new\r\nprinciple of equal opportunity and the open door. On the other, she\r\nappeared as the legatee of many privileges more or less inconsistent\r\nwith that principle. But, at the same time, nearly all the great\r\npowers of Europe were similarly circumstanced. In their cases, also,\r\nthe same incongruity was observed between the newly professed policy\r\nand the aftermath of the old practice. It was scarcely to be expected\r\nthat Japan alone should make a large sacrifice on the altar of a\r\ntheory to which no other State thought of yielding any retrospective\r\nobedience whatever. She did, indeed, furnish a clear proof of\r\ndeference to the open-door doctrine, for instead of reserving the\r\nrailway zones to her own exclusive use, as she was fully entitled to\r\ndo, she sought and obtained from China a pledge to open to foreign\r\ntrade sixteen places within these zones.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, however, the inconsistency between the past and the\r\npresent, though existing throughout the whole of China, was nowhere\r\nso conspicuous as in the three eastern provinces (Manchuria); not\r\nbecause there was any real difference of degree, but because\r\nManchuria had been the scene of the greatest war of modern times;\r\nbecause that war had been fought by Japan in the cause of the new\r\npolicy, and because the principles of the equally open door and of\r\nChina's integrity had been the main bases of the Portsmouth treaty,\r\nof the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and of the subsequently concluded\r\nententes with France and Russia. In short, the world's eyes were\r\nfixed on Manchuria and diverted from China proper, so that every act\r\nof Japan was subjected to an exceptionally rigorous scrutiny, and the\r\nnations behaved as though they expected her to live up to a standard\r\nof almost ideal altitude. China's mood, too, greatly complicated the\r\nsituation. She had the choice between two moderate and natural\r\ncourses; either to wait quietly until the various concessions granted\r\nby her to foreign powers in the evil past should lapse by maturity,\r\nor to qualify herself by earnest reforms and industrious developments\r\nfor their earlier recovery. Nominally she adopted the latter course,\r\nbut in reality she fell into a mood of much impatience. Under the\r\nname of a \"rights-recovery campaign\" her people began to protest\r\nvehemently against the continuance of any conditions which impaired\r\nher sovereignty, and as this temper coloured her attitude towards the\r\nvarious questions which inevitably grew out of the situation in\r\nManchuria, her relations with Japan became somewhat strained in the\r\nearly part of 1909.\r\n\r\nJAPAN IN KOREA AFTER THE WAR WITH RUSSIA\r\n\r\nHaving waged two wars on account of Korea, Japan emerged from the\r\nsecond conflict with the conviction that the policy of maintaining\r\nthe independence of that country must be modified, and that since the\r\nidentity of Korean and Japanese interests in the Far East and the\r\nparamount character of Japanese interests in Korea would not permit\r\nJapan to leave Korea to the care of any third power, she must assume\r\nthe charge herself. Europe and America also recognized that view of\r\nthe situation, and consented to withdraw their legations from Seoul,\r\nthus leaving the control of Korean foreign affairs entirely in the\r\nhands of Japan, who further undertook to assume military direction in\r\nthe event of aggression from without or disturbance from within. But\r\nin the matter of internal administration, she continued to limit\r\nherself to advisory supervision. Thus, though a Japanese\r\nresident-general in Seoul, with subordinate residents throughout the\r\nprovinces, assumed the functions hitherto discharged by foreign\r\nministers and consuls, the Korean Government was merely asked to\r\nemploy Japanese experts in the position of counsellors, the right to\r\naccept or reject their counsels being left to their employers.\r\n\r\nOnce again, however, the futility of looking for any real reforms\r\nunder this optional system was demonstrated. Japan sent her most\r\nrenowned statesman, Prince Ito, to discharge the duties of\r\nresident-general; but even he, in spite of patience and tact, found\r\nthat some less optional methods must be resorted to. Hence, on the\r\n24th of July, 1907, a new agreement was signed, by which the\r\nresident-general acquired initiative as well as consultative\r\ncompetence to enact and enforce laws and ordinances; to appoint and\r\nremove Korean officials, and to place capable Japanese subjects in\r\nthe ranks of the administration. That this constituted a heavy blow\r\nto Korea's independence could not be gainsaid. That it was inevitable\r\nseemed to be equally obvious. For there existed in Korea nearly all\r\nthe worst abuses of medieval systems. The administration of justice\r\ndepended solely on favour or interest. The police contributed by\r\ncorruption and incompetence to the insecurity of life and property.\r\nThe troops were a body of useless mercenaries. Offices being allotted\r\nby sale, thousands of incapables thronged the ranks of the executive.\r\nThe Emperor's Court was crowded by diviners and plotters of all\r\nkinds, male and female. The finances of the Throne and those of the\r\nState were hopelessly confused. There was nothing like an organized\r\njudiciary. A witness was in many cases considered particeps criminis;\r\ntorture was commonly employed to obtain evidence, and defendants in\r\ncivil cases were placed under arrest. Imprisonment meant death or\r\npermanent disablement for a man of means. Flogging so severe as to\r\ncripple, if not to kill, was a common punishment; every major offence\r\nfrom robbery upwards was capital, and female criminals were\r\nfrequently executed by administering shockingly painful poisons. The\r\ncurrency was in a state of the utmost confusion. Extreme corruption\r\nand extortion were practised in connexion with taxation. Finally,\r\nwhile nothing showed that the average Korean lacked the elementary\r\nvirtue of patriotism, there had been repeated proofs that the safety\r\nand independence of the empire counted for little with political\r\nintriguers. Japan must step out of Korea altogether or effect drastic\r\nreforms there.\r\n\r\nShe necessarily chose the latter alternative, and the things which\r\nshe accomplished between the beginning of 1906 and the close of 1908\r\nmay be briefly described as the elaboration of a proper system of\r\ntaxation; the organization of a staff to administer annual budgets;\r\nthe re-assessment of taxable property; the floating of public loans\r\nfor productive enterprises; the reform of the currency; the\r\nestablishment of banks of various kinds, including agricultural and\r\ncommercial; the creation of associations for putting bank-notes into\r\ncirculation; the introduction of a warehousing system to supply\r\ncapital to farmers; the lighting and buoying of the coasts; the\r\nprovision of posts, telegraphs, roads, and railways; the erection of\r\npublic buildings; the starting of various industrial enterprises\r\n(such as printing, brick making, forestry and coal mining); the\r\nlaying out of model farms; the beginning of cotton cultivation; the\r\nbuilding and equipping of an industrial training school; the\r\ninauguration of sanitary works; the opening of hospitals and medical\r\nschools; the organization of an excellent educational system; the\r\nconstruction of waterworks in several towns; the complete\r\nremodelling of the Central Government; the differentiation of the\r\nCourt and the executive, as well as of the administrative and the\r\njudiciary; the formation of an efficient body of police; the\r\norganization of law-courts with a majority of Japanese jurists on the\r\nbench; the enactment of a new penal code, and drastic reforms in the\r\ntaxation system.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1907, the resident-general advised the Throne to\r\ndisband the standing army as an unserviceable and expensive force.\r\nThe measure was, doubtless desirable, but the docility of the troops\r\nhad been overrated. Some of them resisted vehemently, and many became\r\nthe nucleus of an insurrection which lasted in a desultory manner for\r\nnearly two years; cost the lives of 21,000 insurgents and 1300\r\nJapanese, and entailed upon Japan an outlay of nearly a million\r\nsterling. Altogether, what with building 642 miles of railway, making\r\nloans to Korea, providing funds for useful purposes and quelling the\r\ninsurrection, Japan was fifteen millions sterling $72,000,000 out of\r\npocket on Korea's account by the end of 1909. She had also lost the\r\nveteran statesman, Prince Ito, who was assassinated at Harbin by a\r\nKorean fanatic on the 26th of October, 1909.*\r\n\r\n*Encylopaedia Britannica, (11th Edition); article \"Japan,\" by\r\nBrinkley.\r\n\r\nANNEXATION OF KOREA\r\n\r\nJapan finally resolved that nothing short of annexation would suit\r\nthe situation, and that step was taken on August 22, 1910. At what\r\nprecise moment this conviction forced itself upon Japan's judgment it\r\nis impossible to say, She knows how to keep her counsel. But it was\r\ncertainly with great reluctance that she, hitherto the exponent and\r\nchampion of Korean independence, accepted the role of annexation. The\r\nexplanation given by her own Government is as follows:\r\n\r\n-\"In its solicitude to put an end to disturbing conditions, the\r\nJapanese Government made an arrangement, in 1905, for establishing a\r\nprotectorate over Korea and they have ever since been assiduously\r\nengaged in works of reform, looking forward to the consummation of\r\nthe desired end. But they have failed to find in the regime of a\r\nprotectorate sufficient hope for a realization of the object which\r\nthey had in view, and a condition of unrest and disquietude still\r\nprevails throughout the whole peninsula. In these circumstances, the\r\nnecessity of introducing fundamental changes in the system of\r\ngovernment in Korea has become entirely manifest, and an earnest and\r\ncareful examination of the Korean problem has convinced the Japanese\r\nGovernment that the regime of a protectorate cannot be made to adapt\r\nitself to the actual condition of affairs in Korea, and that the\r\nresponsibilities devolving upon Japan for the due administration of\r\nthe country cannot be justly fulfilled without the complete\r\nannexation of Korea to the Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus the dynasty of sovereigns, which had continued in an unbroken\r\nline from 1392, came to an end with the independence of this country,\r\nwhose national traditions and history had extended over four thousand\r\nyears, whose foundation as a kingdom was coeval with that of the\r\nAssyrian empire; and the two last living representatives of the\r\ndynasty exchanged their positions as Imperial dignitaries for those\r\nof princes and pensioners of Japan.\"* Since that drastic step was\r\ntaken, events seem to have fully justified it. Under the able\r\nmanagement of Count Terauchi, the evil conditions inimical to the\r\nprosperity and happiness of the people are fast disappearing.\r\nComparative peace and order reign; and there appears to be no reason\r\nwhy the fruits of progressive civilization should not ultimately be\r\ngathered in Japan's new province as plentifully as they are in Japan\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n*The Story of Korea, by Longford.\r\n\r\nSITUATION IN 1911\r\n\r\nThe unstable element of the East Asian situation to-day is the\r\nposition occupied by Japan and Russia in Manchuria. Both powers\r\npossess privileges there which will not be easily surrendered, and\r\nwhich are likely, sooner or later, to prove incompatible with China's\r\nautonomy. It was apprehended at the outset that Russia would not long\r\nconsent to occupy the place assigned to her by the Treaty of\r\nPortsmouth, and that she would quickly prepare for a war of revenge.\r\nHer statesmen, however, showed as much magnanimity as wisdom. On July\r\n30, 1906, they signed with Japan a convention pledging the\r\ncontracting parties to respect all the rights accruing to one or the\r\nother under the Portsmouth Treaty. If international promises can be\r\ntrusted, continuous peace is assured between the two powers. Russia,\r\nhowever, is not only doubling the track of her Siberian Railway, but\r\nis also building a second line along the Amur; while Japan will soon\r\ncommand access to central Manchuria by three lines; one from Dalny to\r\nKwanchengtsz; another from Fusan via Wiju to Mukden, and a third from\r\nthe northeastern coast of Korea via Hoiryong, on the Tumen, to Kilin.\r\n\r\nThese developments do not suggest that when the lease of Liaotung and\r\nthe charter of the railways mature--in twenty-five years and thirty\r\nyears, respectively, from the date of their signature--either Japan\r\nor Russia will be found ready to surrender these properties.\r\nMeanwhile, the United States of America is gradually constituting\r\nitself the guardian of China's integrity in Manchuria, and the\r\ncitizens of the Pacific slope, under the influence of the labour\r\nquestion, are writing and speaking as though war between the great\r\nrepublic and the Far Eastern empire were an inevitable outcome of the\r\nfuture. This chimera is unthinkable by anyone really familiar with\r\nthe trend of Japanese sentiment, but it may encourage in China a\r\ndangerous mood, and it helps always to foster an unquiet feeling. On\r\nthe whole, when we add the chaotic condition into which China is\r\napparently falling, it has to be admitted that the second decade of\r\nthe twentieth century does not open a peaceful vista in the Far East.\r\n\r\nSTEADY-POINTS\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two steady-points upon the horizon. One is the\r\nAnglo-Japanese treaty: not the treaty of 1902, spoken of already\r\nabove, but a treaty which replaced it and which was concluded on\r\nAugust 12, 1905. The latter document goes much further than the\r\nformer. For, whereas the treaty of 1902 merely pledged each of the\r\ncontracting parties to observe neutrality in the event of the other\r\nbeing engaged in defence of its interests, and to come to that\r\nother's assistance in the event of any third power intervening\r\nbelligerently, the treaty of 1905 provides that:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever in the opinion of either Japan or Great Britain, any of the\r\nrights and interests referred to in the preamble of this agreement\r\nare in jeopardy, the two Governments will communicate with one\r\nanother fully and frankly, and will consider in common the measures\r\nwhich should be taken to safeguard those menaced rights or\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\n\"If, by reason of unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever\r\narising, on the part of any other power or powers, either contracting\r\nparty should be involved in war in defence of its territorial rights\r\nor special interests mentioned in the preamble of this agreement, the\r\nother contracting party will at once come to the assistance of its\r\nally, and will conduct the war in common, and make peace in mutual\r\nagreement with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"rights and interests\" here referred to are defined as follows\r\nin the preamble:\r\n\r\n\"The consolidation and maintenance of the general peace in the\r\nregions of eastern Asia and of India.\"\r\n\r\n\"The preservation of the common interests of all powers in China by\r\ninsuring the independence and integrity of the Chinese empire and the\r\nprinciple of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all\r\nnations in China.\"\r\n\r\n\"The maintenance of the territorial rights of the high contracting\r\nparties in the regions of eastern Asia and of India, and the defence\r\nof their special interests in the said regions.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable agreement came into force from the date of its\r\nsignature, and its period of duration was fixed at ten years. During\r\nits existence the two powers, England and Japan, are pledged to use\r\nall endeavours for maintaining not only peace in the East, but also\r\nthe independence and integrity of China. The significance of such a\r\npledge is appreciated when we recall the dimensions of the British\r\nnavy supplemented by the Japanese, and when we further recall that\r\nJapan, with her base of operations within easy reach of the Asiatic\r\ncontinent, can place half a million of men in the field at any\r\nmoment. The second steady-point is China's financial condition. She\r\nis the debtor of several Western nations, and they may be trusted to\r\navert from her any vicissitude that would impair her credit as a\r\nborrower. Prominent among such vicissitudes is the dismemberment of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING: SEAL OF SESSHO, THE PAINTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

The present Agreement shall, subject to the provisions\r\nof Article VI, come into effect immediately after the date of its\r\nsignature, and remain in force for ten years from that date.\r\n\r\nIn case neither of the High Contracting Parties should have notified\r\ntwelve months before the expiration of the said ten years the\r\nintention of terminating it, it shall remain binding until the\r\nexpiration of one year from the day on which either of the High\r\nContracting Parties shall have denounced it.
