It may truly be said that the history of every\r\none of our northern tier of commonwealths, from Maine to Minnesota,\r\nhas its roots in the French régime. It is not true, as Bancroft avers,\r\nthat the Jesuit was ever the pioneer of New France; we now know that in\r\nthis land, as elsewhere in all ages, the trader nearly always preceded\r\nthe priest. But the trader was not often a letter-writer or a diarist:\r\nhence, we owe our intimate knowledge of New France, particularly in\r\nthe seventeenth century, chiefly to the wandering missionaries of the\r\nSociety of Jesus. Coming early to the shores of Nova Scotia (1611),\r\nnearly a decade before the landing of the Plymouth Pilgrims, and\r\neventually spreading throughout the broad expanse of New France, ever\r\nclose upon the track of the adventurous coureur de bois, they met\r\nthe American savage before contact with civilization had seriously\r\naffected him. With heroic fortitude, often with marvellous enterprise,\r\nthey pierced our wilderness while still there were but Indian trails\r\nto connect far-distant villages of semi-naked aborigines. They saw\r\nNorth America and the North Americans practically in the primitive\r\nstage. Cultivated men, for the most part,--trained to see as well as to\r\nthink, and carefully to make record of their experiences,--they left\r\nthe most luxurious country in Europe to seek shelter in the foul and\r\nunwelcome huts of one of the most wretched races of man. To win these\r\ncrude beings to the Christian Faith, it was necessary to know them\r\nintimately, in their daily walks. No coureur de bois was more expert\r\nin forest lore than were the Jesuit Fathers; and the records made by\r\nthese soldiers of the Cross,--explicit and detailed, while familiar\r\nin tone,--are of the highest scientific value, often of considerable\r\nliterary interest. The body of contemporary, documentary material\r\nwhich, in their _Relations_ and Letters, the Jesuits of New France\r\nhave bequeathed to the historian, the geographer, and the ethnologist,\r\nentitles them to the enduring gratitude of American scholars. For forty\r\nyears, these documents have, in part, been more or less familiar to\r\nAmericanists as a rich storehouse of material. But, hitherto, they\r\nhave existed only in rare and costly forms, when in print at all,--as\r\noriginal products of ancient French, Italian, and German presses, or\r\nas reprints issued in sparse number for small circles of bibliophiles;\r\nwhile many important papers, capable of throwing light upon certain\r\nportions of Canadian history hitherto in shade, have as yet remained in\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nWe cannot promise for this series the entire body of existing Jesuit\r\ndocuments, either printed or in manuscript, which illustrate the\r\nhistory of New France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This\r\nwould carry us, even were they all obtainable, far beyond the necessary\r\nlimits of this series; for the fathers were profuse writers, and their\r\npapers are in many archives. It is of necessity a matter of selection.\r\nWe shall, however, reissue all of the documents usually designated\r\nas _Relations_,--the Cramoisys, the Quebec reissue, the Shea and\r\nO'Callaghan reprints; and to these will be added a very considerable\r\ncollection of miscellaneous papers of importance, from printed sources\r\nand from manuscripts, in order to fill the chronological gaps and\r\nround out and complete the story. It is the purpose of the Editor to\r\npresent this mass of selected material in chronological order, so\r\nfar as proves practicable, and to furnish such scholarly helps as\r\nwill tend to render it more available than hitherto for daily use by\r\nstudents of American history. To this end will be given an English\r\ntranslation, side by side with the original text. While translations\r\nof many of the briefest documents, and of portions of others, have\r\nalready appeared in one form of other, this is the first attempt to\r\ntranslate the entire body of the _Relations_. In many cases, where\r\ncorruptions in text have crept in, we shall be enabled, by recourse to\r\noriginal manuscripts, to restore correct renderings; this care has been\r\ntaken, wherever practicable, even to the examination of manuscripts in\r\nEuropean archives; but occasionally we shall be obliged to follow our\r\npredecessors blindly in this regard, either from inability to discover\r\nthe whereabouts of the original, or to obtain access to it, when found.\r\nIn the case of each document, we shall invariably state the source\r\nwhence we obtained our copy, and shall give additional bibliographical\r\ndata as to other editions known to us. All maps and other illustrations\r\nappearing in previous editions will be reproduced in this; and these\r\nwill be supplemented by other important contemporary aids of like\r\ncharacter. At the end of each volume will appear such Notes as seem\r\nnecessary to the elucidation of the text. The closing volume of the\r\nseries will contain--and probably will be wholly devoted to--an\r\nexhaustive analytical Index, a feature without which the work would\r\nlose much of its value. In short, no pains have been, or will be,\r\nspared to render all possible service to scholars, in the present\r\nwork. But the field is wide, the difficulties are many, and the Editor\r\nmakes no claims to perfection. He will be grateful to any who, in the\r\ncourse of publication,--promising to extend through several years yet\r\nto come,--will offer helpful suggestions in any department of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nWhile seeking to reproduce the old texts as closely as practicable,\r\nwith their legitimate typographic and orthographic peculiarities, it\r\nhas been found advisable here and there to make a few minor changes.\r\nThe original printer was sometimes careless,--Cramoisy especially\r\nso,--and his proof-reader negligent. The result was that certain\r\ntypographical errors crept into the original prints,--errors not of the\r\nauthor's making, and therefore not illustrative of his methods. These\r\nconsist in the main, of: (1) turned letters; (2) transposed letters;\r\n(3) slipped letters; and (4) mis-spacings. To these obvious errors may\r\nbe added such as, e.g., mistaking the verb _gratter_ for _grauer_,\r\nevidently through a failure on the part of the writer to cross his\r\nt's,--the context plainly showing what was written; the printing,\r\ne.g., of _beau[(c]oup_ for _beaucoup_; or the repetition on the next\r\nline of a syllable in a divided word, resulting in such a redundancy\r\nas, _poupouuant_ for _pouuant_. Palpable blemishes like these, we\r\nhave deemed it advisable to correct without specific mention; in\r\nsome instances, however, the original error has been retained, and in\r\njuxtaposition the correct rendering given within brackets.\r\n\r\nAnother and more annoying class of errors is, the wrong numbering of\r\nchapters and pages in the old issues, chiefly the fruit of carelessness\r\nin make-up. We indicate, throughout, the original pagination, by\r\ninclosing within brackets the number of each page at its beginning,\r\ne.g. [148]; in case of misnumbering, the correct figure is also given,\r\ne.g. [150, i.e. 149]. A similar device is adopted as to chapter\r\nmisnumbering, e.g. Chapitre XXX. [i.e. XXIX.].\r\n\r\nA difference in the typographic style of the documents presented in the\r\npresent series, will occasionally be noticed. In following originals of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we have of course reproduced\r\ntheir peculiarities, such as the long \"s,\" and character diphthongs;\r\nbut where our sole copy has been a modern reprint, in a modern\r\ntypographic dress, we have followed its style, deeming it inadvisable,\r\nfor mere sake of uniformity, to masquerade the document in olden guise.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the work, which has now been under way for some\r\nsixteen months, many persons beside the present staff have tendered\r\nhelping hands. To them, the Editor returns, for the Publishers and\r\nfor himself, grateful acknowledgment. It is impracticable to name\r\nthem all in this place; but of a few from whom special favors have\r\nbeen received, it is only just to speak: The Reverend Arthur E.\r\nJones, S. J., archivist of St. Mary's College, Montreal, from the\r\nfirst opened his heart to this enterprise, and has not only given us\r\n_carte blanche_ to ransack his priceless stores, but has contributed\r\ninvaluable suggestions and data, almost without number. To Wilberforce\r\nEames, librarian of Lenox Library, and his assistant, Victor H.\r\nPaltsits, we owe much; for in their institution the greater part\r\nof the transcription is being done, and their daily courtesies and\r\nkindnesses materially lighten the task. Superintendent Robbins Little,\r\nand Librarian Frederick Saunders, of Astor Library, have also been of\r\nmuch assistance in the conduct of the work. To John Nicholas Brown,\r\nof Providence, R. I., and to his librarian, George Parker Winship,\r\nwe are indebted for numerous courtesies and suggestions during the\r\ncopying and photographing of documents in the John Carter Brown Library\r\nof Americana. Similar aid is being rendered by Dr. Justin Winsor, of\r\nHarvard College Library, and his assistants, W. H. Tillinghast and T.\r\nJ. Kiernan; by the librarians of St. Francis Xavier College, New York,\r\nand the Jesuit Colleges at Georgetown, D. C., and Woodstock, Md.; by L.\r\nP. Sylvani, assistant librarian of the Library of Parliament, Ottawa;\r\nand by C. H. Gould, librarian of McGill University Library, Montreal,\r\nand his assistant, Henry Mott. Donald Guthrie McNab, of Montreal,\r\nhas kindly permitted us to photograph and reproduce his excellent\r\noil portraits of the early fathers; and, in this connection, we feel\r\nunder especial obligations to Messrs. Notman & Son, of Montreal, for\r\ntheir intelligent advice and patience in photographing paintings and\r\nmanuscripts for the series. Marked privileges have been granted by\r\nthe officials of the Bibliothèque Nationale and the Bibliothèque de\r\nl'Arsenal, of Paris. Numerous antiquarians have rendered generous aid,\r\nnotably Peter A. Porter, of Niagara Falls, N. Y.; W. M. Beauchamp,\r\nof Baldwinsville, N. Y.; l'Abbé H. A. B. Verreau, of Montreal; Mgr.\r\nT. E. Hamel, of Quebec; and A. F. Hunter, of Barrie, Ontario. Further\r\nacknowledgment of assistance will be rendered in the several volumes,\r\nas they appear.\r\n\r\n  R. G.

But five centuries passed\r\nwithout result, and we cannot properly call them pioneers of American\r\ncivilization. Columbus it was, who unlocked the eastern door of the\r\nNew World. Five years later, John Cabot, in behalf of England, was\r\nsighting the gloomy headlands of Cape Breton. Cortereal appeared in\r\nthe neighborhood, in 1501, seeking lands for the Portuguese crown.\r\nAbout this time, at intervals, there came to Newfoundland certain\r\nNorman, Breton, and Basque fishers, who, erecting little huts and\r\ndrying-scaffolds along the rocky shore, sowed the first seed of that\r\npolyglot settlement of French, Portuguese, Spanish, and English which\r\nhas come down to our day almost uninterruptedly. By 1511, these\r\nfishermen appear to have known the mainland to the west; for on the\r\nmap of Sylvanus, in his edition of Ptolemy, that year, we find a\r\ndelineation of the \"Square Gulf,\" which answers to the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence. In 1520, Fagundus visited these waters for the Portuguese,\r\nand four years later Verrazano was making for the French an exploration\r\nof the coast between North Carolina and Newfoundland. Whether or not\r\nCartier (1535) was the first to sail up the St. Lawrence \"until land\r\ncould be seen on either side,\" no man can now tell; apparently, he was\r\nthe first to leave a record of doing so. Progress up the river was\r\nchecked by Lachine Rapids, and he spent the winter on Montreal Island.\r\n\r\nFrance and Spain were just then engaged in one of their periodical\r\nquarrels, and adventurers were needed to fight battles at home, so\r\nthat it was six years before any attempts were made to colonize the\r\nriver-lands to which Cartier had led the way. In 1541, a Picard\r\nseigneur named Roberval, enjoying the friendship of Francis I., was\r\ncommissioned as viceroy of the new country beyond the Atlantic, with\r\nCartier as his chief pilot and captain-general, and a choice selection\r\nof jail-birds for colonists. Cartier started off before his chief,\r\nbuilt a fort at Quebec, and, after a long and miserable winter, picked\r\nup a quantity of glittering stones which he took to be gold and\r\ndiamonds, and gladly set sail for home. Tradition has it that Roberval\r\nmet him near the mouth of the river, but was unable to induce him to\r\nreturn to his cheerless task of founding a state in an inhospitable\r\nwilderness, with convicts for citizens. Roberval, however, proceeded\r\nto Quebec with his consignment of prison dregs, and throughout another\r\nprotracted winter the flag of France floated from the little intrenched\r\ncamp which Cartier had planted on the summit of the cliff. Roberval's\r\nprincipal occupation appears to have been the disciplining of his\r\nunruly followers, a work in which the gibbet and the lash were freely\r\nemployed. He also essayed explorations up the river; but the rude task\r\nwas not to his liking, and, with what remained of his battered band, he\r\nfollowed Cartier to France.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that Canada was abandoned by the French between\r\nthe going of Roberval and the coming of Champlain. But, though little\r\nwas done toward colonizing on the St. Lawrence, Newfoundland was by\r\nno means neglected. Its fishing industry grew apace. The rules of the\r\nChurch, prescribing a fish diet on certain holy days, led to a large\r\nuse of salted fish throughout Catholic Europe; and, by 1578, full a\r\nhundred and fifty French vessels alone, chiefly Breton, were employed\r\nin the Newfoundland fisheries, while a good trade with the mainland\r\nIndians, as far south as the Potomac, had now sprung up. The island\r\ncolony proved valuable as a supply and repair station for traders and\r\nexplorers, and thus served as a nucleus of both French and English\r\nsettlement in America.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us of to-day to realize that, at any time in the\r\nworld's history, enlightened folk should have thought good colonists\r\ncould be made out of the sweepings of the jails and gutters of the Old\r\nWorld. But in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that delusion\r\nwas quite generally entertained by would-be founders of states across\r\nsea; it required the lessons of more than a hundred years of disastrous\r\nexperiments to teach discerning men that only the best of the middle\r\nclass and the masses, can successfully plant a new community in\r\nthe wilderness. The experiences of Cartier and Roberval on the St.\r\nLawrence, and of Laudonnière in Florida (1564), were of no avail in\r\ninfluencing governmental policy at Paris. In 1590, the Marquis de la\r\nRoche was sent out with the usual dissolute crew to succeed Roberval as\r\nthe king's agent on the banks of the St. Lawrence. Leaving part of his\r\nill-favored gang on the desert Sable Isle, off Nova Scotia (where early\r\nin the century Baron de Léry had vainly attempted to plant a colony),\r\nLa Roche set forth to explore the mainland for a site. A wild storm\r\nblew his vessels to France, and the wretched skin-clad survivors of the\r\nband which he had left behind were not rescued until thirteen years had\r\nelapsed. Their tale of horror long rang in the ears of France.\r\n\r\nIn 1600-1603, Chauvin and Pontgravé made successful trading voyages\r\nto the St. Lawrence. Samuel de Champlain was one of the party\r\nwhich, in the latter year, followed in Cartier's track to Montreal.\r\nThe same season, a Calvinist, named De Monts, was given the\r\nvice-royalty and fur-trade monopoly of Acadia, and in 1604 he landed\r\na strangely-assorted company of vagabonds and gentlemen on St. Croix\r\nIsland, near the present boundary between Maine and New Brunswick; but\r\nin the spring following they settled at Port Royal, near where is now\r\nAnnapolis, Nova Scotia, thus planting the first French agricultural\r\nsettlement in America. Five years later, Champlain reared a permanent\r\npost on the rock of Quebec, and New France was at last, after a century\r\nof experiments, fairly under way.\r\n\r\nVarious motives influenced the men who sought to establish French\r\ncolonization in America. The ill-fated agricultural colony of the\r\nHuguenots in Florida (1562-68), was avowedly an attempt of Admiral\r\nColigny to found an enduring asylum for French Protestants. The\r\nenterprise of New France, on the other hand, was the outgrowth of\r\ninterests more or less conflicting. Doubtless the court had deepest\r\nat heart the kingly passion for territorial aggrandizement; next\r\nuppermost, was the pious wish to convert heathen nations to the\r\nCatholic faith, explorers like Cartier being authorized to discover\r\nnew lands \"in order the better to do what is pleasing to God, our\r\nCreator and Redeemer, and what may be for the increase of his holy\r\nand sacred name, and of our holy mother, the Church;\" the desire for\r\npelf, through the agency of the fur trade, and the possibility of the\r\ndiscovery of precious metals, gave commercial zest to the undertaking,\r\nand to many was the _raison d'être_ of the colony; and lastly, was the\r\nalmost universal yearning for adventure, among a people who in the\r\nseventeenth century were still imbued with that chivalric temper which\r\namong Englishmen is assigned to the Middle Ages. The inner life of New\r\nFrance, throughout its century and a half of existence, was largely a\r\nwarring between these several interests.\r\n\r\nMissionaries came early upon the scene. With the Calvinist De Monts\r\nwere Huguenot ministers for the benefit of the settlers, and Catholic\r\npriests to open a mission among the savages, for the court had\r\nstipulated with him that the latter were to be instructed only in the\r\nfaith of Rome. But no missionary work was done, for the colony was\r\nthrough several years on the verge of dissolution, and the priests\r\nbecame victims of scurvy. Poutrincourt, who held under De Monts the\r\npatent for Port Royal, did nothing to further the purposes of the\r\ncourt in this regard, until 1610, when, admonished for his neglect,\r\nhe brought out with him a secular priest, Messire Jessé Fléché,\r\nof Langres, who on June 24, \"apparently in some haste,\" baptized\r\ntwenty-one Abenakis, including the district sagamore, or chief. The\r\naccount of this affair, which Poutrincourt sent in triumph to France,\r\nis the initial document in the present series.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of June, 1611, there arrived at Port Royal, at the\r\ninstance of King Henry IV., two Jesuit fathers, Pierre Biard and\r\nEnnemond Massé. They were, however, not favorably received by\r\nPoutrincourt and his followers; they found great practical difficulties\r\nin acquiring the Indian languages and made slight progress in the\r\nherculean task to which they had been set. To them, came the following\r\nyear, a lay brother, Gilbert du Thet, who was soon dispatched to the\r\nhead of the order, in France, with an account of the situation. In the\r\nspring of 1613, he returned, in company with Father Quentin. The little\r\nband of missionaries had no sooner established themselves at the new\r\nFrench colony on Mt. Desert Island, than the latter was attacked and\r\ndispersed by the Virginian Argall. Du Thet was killed in the fight,\r\nMassé was, with other colonists, set adrift in a boat, and Biard and\r\nQuentin were taken to Virginia, to be eventually shipped to England,\r\nand thence allowed to return into France. Several of the earlier\r\ndocuments of our series have to do with this first and apparently\r\nunfruitful mission of the Jesuits to Acadia.\r\n\r\nIn 1615, Champlain thought the time ripe for the institution of Indian\r\nmissions upon the St. Lawrence, a spiritual field hitherto neglected,\r\nand introduced to Quebec four members of the fraternity of Récollets,\r\nthe most austere of the three orders of Franciscans; these were\r\nFathers Denis Jamay, Jean d'Olbeau, and Joseph le Caron, and a lay\r\nbrother, Pacifique du Plessis. To D'Olbeau was assigned the conversion\r\nof the Montagnais of the Lower St. Lawrence; Le Caron went to the\r\nHurons, or Wyandots, in the vast stretch of forested wilderness west\r\nof the Ottawa River, and before the coming of autumn had established\r\na bark chapel in their midst; Jamay and Du Plessis remained in the\r\nneighborhood of Quebec, ministering to the colonists and the wandering\r\nsavages who came to the little settlement for purposes of trade or\r\nsociability, or through fear of scalp-hunting Iroquois. For ten years\r\ndid these gray friars practice the rites of the church in the Canadian\r\nwoods, all the way from the fishing and trading outpost of Tadoussac\r\nto the western Lake of the Nipissings. Barefooted, save for heavy\r\nwooden sandals, coarsely clad in gown and hood, enduring in a rigorous\r\nclimate, to which they were unused, all manner of hardships by flood\r\nand field, they were earnestly devoted to their laborious calling in a\r\ntime when elsewhere the air of New France was noisy with the strife of\r\nself-seeking traders and politicians. Yet somehow their mission seemed\r\nwithout important result. Even less successful was the enterprise of\r\nsome fellow Récollets, who, in 1619, began independent work among the\r\nFrench fishermen and Micmacs of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Gaspé,\r\nbut were forced in 1624, after many disasters, to abandon their task,\r\nthree of them joining the party at Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe little band on the St. Lawrence, although thus reinforced, felt\r\nimpelled, in 1625, to invite the powerful aid of the Jesuits, who\r\nin the face of great odds were just then holding most successful\r\nmissions in Asia, Africa, and South America. In response to the call,\r\nthree fathers of the black gown came to Quebec this year,--Massé, who\r\nhad been of the old Acadian mission, Charles Lalemant, and that giant\r\namong them, in both stature and deeds, Jean de Brébeuf. Immediately\r\nthe work began to broaden, but the records of the dual mission do not\r\ngive evidence of many converts,--a few Huron youth taken to France, and\r\nthere instructed and baptized, being the chief gains. The wandering\r\nhabits of the Indians were not favorable to persistent instruction\r\nof the young, and adults were unwilling to commit themselves to the\r\nnew doctrine, even when not openly opposed to its promulgation. The\r\nsummer months were usually spent by the missionaries at Tadoussac,\r\nQuebec, and Three Rivers, where trading parties from the tribes were\r\nwont to assemble; and, when the latter scattered for their winter\r\nhunts, the missionaries accompanied them, sharing the toils, dangers,\r\nand discomforts of the movable camps, and often suffering much from\r\npositive abuse at the hands of their not over-willing hosts.\r\n\r\nThe settlements of Port Royal and Quebec were at this time wretched\r\nlittle hamlets of a few dozen huts each, surrounded by a palisade, and\r\nthese fell an easy prey to small English naval forces (1628-29). With\r\ntheir fall, ended the slender mission of the Récollets and Jesuits, who\r\nwere in triumph carried off to England. For a few months, France did\r\nnot hold one foot of ground in North America. But as peace had been\r\ndeclared between France and England before this conquest, the former\r\nreceived back all of its possessions, and the inevitable struggle for\r\nthe mastery of the continent was postponed for four generations longer.\r\n\r\nWith the release of Canada to France, in 1632, the Jesuits were by the\r\nhome authorities placed in sole charge of the spiritual interests of\r\nboth settlers and Indians, and the history of their greatest missions\r\nbegins at this time. On the fifth of July, there landed at Quebec,\r\nFathers Paul le Jeune and Anne de Nouë, and a lay brother named\r\nGilbert. Le Jeune was the superior, and at once devoted himself to\r\nlearning the language and customs of the savages, and so studying the\r\nenormous field before him as intelligently to dispose of his meagre\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe existence of rival tribes among the Red Indians of North America,\r\nwas, perhaps, the most formidable obstacle in the path of the\r\nmissionaries. It has always been impossible to make any hard-and-fast\r\nclassification; yet the Indians presented a considerable variety\r\nof types, ranging from the Southern Indians, some of whose tribes\r\nwere in a relatively high stage of material advancement and mental\r\ncalibre, down to the savage root-eaters of the Rocky Mountain region.\r\nThe migrations of some of the Indian tribes were frequent, and they\r\noccupied overlapping territories, so that it is impossible to fix the\r\ntribal boundaries with any degree of exactness. Again, the tribes\r\nwere so merged by intermarriage, by affiliation, by consolidation, by\r\nthe fact that there were numerous polyglot villages of renegades, by\r\nsimilarities in manner, habits, and appearance, that it is difficult\r\neven to separate the savages into families. It is only on philological\r\ngrounds that these divisions can be made at all. In a general way we\r\nmay say that between the Atlantic and the Rockies, Hudson Bay and the\r\nGulf of Mexico, there were four Indian languages in vogue, with great\r\nvarieties of local dialect:\r\n\r\nI. The Algonkins were the most numerous, holding the greater portion of\r\nthe country from the unoccupied \"debatable land\" of Kentucky northward\r\nto Hudson Bay, and from the Atlantic westward to the Mississippi. Among\r\ntheir tribes were the Micmacs of Acadia, the Penobscots of Maine, the\r\nMontagnais of the St. Lawrence, the ill-defined tribes of the country\r\nround about Lake St. John, and the Ottawas, Chippewas, Mascoutens,\r\nSacs, Foxes, Pottawattomies, and Illinois of the Upper Lakes. These\r\nsavages were rude in life and manners, were intensely warlike, depended\r\nfor subsistence chiefly on hunting and fishing, lived in rude wigwams\r\ncovered with bark, skins, or matted reeds, practised agriculture in\r\na crude fashion, and were less stable in their habitations than the\r\nSouthern Indians. They have made a larger figure in our history than\r\nany other family, because through their lands came the heaviest and\r\nmost aggressive movement of white population, French or English.\r\nEstimates of early Indian populations necessarily differ, in the\r\nabsence of accurate knowledge; but it is now believed that the number\r\nwas never so great as was at first estimated by the Jesuit fathers and\r\nthe earliest English colonists. A careful modern estimate is, that the\r\nAlgonkins at no time numbered over 90,000 souls, and possibly not over\r\n50,000.\r\n\r\nII. In the heart of this Algonkin land was planted the ethnic group\r\ncalled the Iroquois, with its several distinct branches, often at war\r\nwith each other. The craftiest, most daring, and most intelligent\r\nof North American Indians, yet still in the savage hunter state, the\r\nIroquois were the terror of every native band east of the Mississippi,\r\nbefore the coming of the whites, who in turn learned to dread their\r\nferocious power. The five principal tribes of this family--Mohawks,\r\nOneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas, all stationed in palisaded\r\nvillages south and east of lakes Erie and Ontario--formed a loose\r\nconfederacy styled by themselves and the French \"The Long House,\" and\r\nby the English \"The Five Nations,\" which firmly held the waterways\r\nconnecting the Hudson and Ohio rivers and the Great Lakes. The\r\npopulation of the entire group was not over 17,000--a remarkably small\r\nnumber, considering the active part they played in American history,\r\nand the control which they exercised through wide tracts of wilderness.\r\nRelated to, but generally at war with them, were the Hurons of Canada,\r\namong whom the Jesuits planted their earliest missions. Champlain,\r\nin an endeavor to cultivate the friendship of his Huron and Algonkin\r\nneighbors, early made war on the Iroquois, and thus secured for New\r\nFrance a heritage of savage enmity which contributed more than any\r\nother one cause to cripple its energies and render it at last an easy\r\nprey to the rival power of the English colonies.\r\n\r\nIII. The Southern Indians occupied the country between the Tennessee\r\nRiver and the Gulf, the Appalachian Ranges and the Mississippi. Of\r\na milder disposition than their Northern cousins, the Cherokees,\r\nChickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks, and Seminoles were rather in a barbarous\r\nthan in a savage state; by the time of the Revolution, they were not\r\nfar behind the white proprietors in industrial or domestic methods,\r\nand numbered not above 50,000 persons. With them, this story of the\r\nJesuit missions has little to do; the Louisiana mission, an offshoot of\r\nthat of New France, did faithful work here, but the documentary result\r\nwas neither as interesting nor as prolific, and necessarily occupies\r\nbut small space in the present series.\r\n\r\nIV. The Dakotah, or Sioux, family occupied for the most part the\r\ncountry beyond the Mississippi. They were and are a fierce, high-strung\r\npeople, genuine nomads, and war appears to have been their chief\r\noccupation. The Jesuits worked among them but in slight measure, on\r\nthe waters of the Upper Mississippi; they met this family, chiefly in\r\nthe persons of the Winnebagoes, one of their outlying bands, which at\r\nthe time of the French occupation was resident on and about Green Bay\r\nof Lake Michigan, at peace and in confederacy with the Algonkins who\r\nhedged them about.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the French Jesuits to these widely-scattered hordes of\r\nsavages forms one of the most thrilling chapters in human history. It\r\nis impossible, in this brief Introduction, to attempt anything more\r\nthan the barest outline of the theme; Rochemonteix, Shea, and Parkman\r\nhave told the story in detail, from differing points of view, and with\r\nthese authorities the student of the following documents in the case\r\nis presumed to be familiar. A rapid summary of results will, however,\r\nbe useful; and this we may best obtain, at the expense of occasional\r\nrepetition of narrative, by following the fortunes of the pioneers of\r\nthe Cross through the several district missions into which their work\r\nwas naturally divided.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE ABENAKI MISSION.\r\n\r\nThis mission was chiefly in Maine and Acadia, and on Cape Breton\r\nIsland. The Abenakis (or Abnakis) were a strong but mild-mannered\r\nAlgonkin tribe, settled in villages or cantonments; but, like others\r\nof their race, in the habit of taking long semi-annual journeys,--each\r\nwinter to hunt, and each summer to fish. We have seen that the\r\nFrench Jesuits, Biard and Massé, were in the field as early as 1611,\r\nsoon after the establishment of Port Royal; their predecessor being\r\nthe secular French priest, Fléché, who had been introduced to the\r\ncountry by Poutrincourt, the patentee. Biard and Massé met with\r\nmany discouragements, chiefly the opposition of Poutrincourt's son,\r\nBiencourt (sometimes called Baron St. Just), who had been left in\r\ncharge of the colony. Nevertheless the missionaries learned the native\r\nlanguage, and made many long journeys of exploration, one of Biard's\r\ntrips extending as far as the mouth of the Kennebec. They were later\r\njoined by a lay brother, Du Thet, and by Fathers Quentin and Lalemant.\r\nJoining the new French colony on Mt. Desert Island, in the spring\r\nof 1613, the establishment was almost immediately destroyed by the\r\nVirginian Argall. In the skirmish, Du Thet was killed.\r\n\r\nIn 1619, a party of Récollets, from Aquitaine, began a mission on St.\r\nJohn River, in Acadia, but five years later, as we have seen above,\r\nabandoned the task, the survivors joining the Quebec mission of their\r\norder. Other Récollets were in Acadia, however, between 1630 and 1633,\r\nand later we have evidence of a small band of Capuchins ministering to\r\nFrench settlers on the Penobscot and Kennebec; but it is probable that\r\nthey made no attempt to convert the natives.\r\n\r\nA Jesuit mission was founded on Cape Breton in 1634, by Father Julian\r\nPerrault; and a few years later, Father Charles Turgis was at Miscou.\r\nOther missionaries soon came to minister to the Micmacs, but for many\r\nyears their efforts were without result; and sickness, resulting from\r\nthe hardships of the situation, caused most of the early black gowns to\r\nretreat from the attempt. Finally, an enduring mission was established\r\namong these people, and, until about 1670, was conducted with some\r\nmeasure of success by Fathers Andrew Richard, Martin de Lyonne, and\r\nJames Fremin. About 1673, the Récollets took up the now abandoned work,\r\noccasionally aided by secular priests from the Seminary of Quebec,\r\nand Jesuits, until at last the Micmacs from Gaspé to Nova Scotia were\r\ndeclared to be entirely converted to the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nFather Gabriel Druillettes, of the Jesuit mission at Sillery, near\r\nQuebec, went to the Kennebec country in 1646, invited thither by\r\nconverted Abenakis who had been at Sillery, and during visits,\r\nextending through a period of eleven years, was more than ordinarily\r\nsuccessful in the task of gaining Indian converts to Christianity. In\r\n1650, he made a notable visit to the Puritans of Eastern Massachusetts,\r\nduring which was discussed the proposed union between New France\r\nand New England, against the Iroquois. Upon the final departure of\r\nDruillettes in 1657, the Abenakis were but spasmodically served with\r\nmissionaries; occasionally a Jesuit appeared among them, but the field\r\ncould not be persistently worked, owing to the demands upon the order\r\nfrom other quarters. The fathers now sought to draw Abenaki converts\r\nto Sillery, and later to St. Francis de Sales, at the falls of the\r\nChaudière, which soon became almost exclusively an Abenaki mission.\r\n\r\nIn 1688, Father Bigot, of this mission, again entered the field of\r\nthe Kennebec, at the same time that Rev. Peter Thury, a priest of the\r\nQuebec Seminary, opened a mission on the Penobscot, and the Récollet\r\nF. Simon gathered a flock at Medoktek, near the mouth of the St.\r\nJohn. They were in time aided and succeeded by others: the Jesuits\r\nbeing Julian Binneteau, Joseph Aubery, Peter de la Chasse, Stephen\r\nLauverjeat, Loyard, and Sebastian Rale; the death of Rale, the greatest\r\nof them all, at the hands of New England partisans in the border\r\nstrife of 1724, is a familiar incident in American history. Jesuits\r\nsucceeded to the Penobscot mission in 1703, and with great zeal, but\r\namid continual hardships and discouragements, carried on the principal\r\nwork among the Abenakis until the downfall of New France in 1763. The\r\nmajority of the Kennebec converts, however, emigrated to the mission\r\nof St. Francis de Sales, and from there frequently went forth upon\r\navenging expeditions against the New England borderers.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MONTAGNAIS MISSION.\r\n\r\nThis was centered at Tadoussac, and ministered to the Montagnais,\r\nBersiamites, Porcupines, Oumaniwek, Papinachois, and other tribes\r\nof the Lower St. Lawrence and the Saguenay. Tadoussac had, from the\r\nearliest historic times, been a favorite harbor and trading-station\r\nfor the French; for, being at the junction of two great rivers, it\r\nwas convenient as a place of assembly for the natives of the lower\r\ncountry. The first priests in the district had said mass there; but it\r\nwas not until 1640 that a Jesuit mission was formed by Father Jean du\r\nQuen, its sphere of influence soon reaching to the upper waters of the\r\nSaguenay, Lake St. John, Hudson Bay, and the coast of Labrador. Du Quen\r\nwas actively assisted by Charles Meiachkwat, a Montagnais convert, who\r\nerected the first chapel, became a catechist, and made extended tours\r\nthrough the neighboring tribes. In time, there were associated with\r\nDu Quen, Fathers Buteux and Druillettes. Protracted missionary tours\r\nwere made by them, with results which were considered satisfactory as\r\ncompared with other missions; although they had serious difficulties\r\nto contend with, in the prevalent intemperance which the fur trade\r\nintroduced among the natives, the belief in dreams, the laxity of\r\nmorals, and the wiles of medicine-men, or sorcerers, as they were\r\ncalled by the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years, the missionaries spent their winters in\r\nQuebec, ministering to the colonists, and each spring went down to\r\nTadoussac to meet the summer trading parties; but greater persistency\r\nof effort was deemed desirable, and thereafter, instead of returning\r\nhome in the autumn, they followed the Indians upon their winter hunts,\r\nand in the course of these wanderings endured the usual privations and\r\nhardships of traveling camps. Bailloquet, Nouvel, Beaulieu, Albanel,\r\nDe Crépieul, Dalmas, Boucher, Peter Michael Laure, and Jean Baptiste\r\nLabrosse, are other names of Jesuit fathers who at different periods\r\nwere engaged upon this toilsome mission.\r\n\r\nIn 1670, Tadoussac was almost deserted, owing to Iroquois raids and the\r\nravages of smallpox; the Montagnais and kindred tribes were in hiding,\r\nthrough the vast country between Lake St. John and Hudson Bay. They\r\nwere still followed by their devoted shepherds, whom no hardship could\r\ndiscourage. The following year, Crépieul began a mission on Hudson Bay,\r\nand here in 1694 his auxiliary Dalmas was killed. Laure (1720-37) left\r\nus a monument of his labors in a Montagnais grammar and dictionary.\r\nLabrosse, the last of his order at Tadoussac, instructed many of his\r\nflock to read and write, and left a legacy of native education, which\r\nhas lasted unto the present day; he lived and taught long after his\r\norder had been suppressed in New France, and died at Tadoussac in 1782.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE QUEBEC AND MONTREAL MISSIONS.\r\n\r\nThese included the several missions at Quebec, Montreal, Three Rivers,\r\nSillery, Bécancourt, and St. Francis de Sales, which were designed for\r\nthe wandering Montagnais of the district, those Algonkins of the West\r\nwho could be induced to come and settle on the lower waters, and in\r\nlater years such Abenakis of Acadia and Maine as sought an asylum upon\r\ndistinctively French soil.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Récollets were first at Quebec, ministering both to\r\ncolonists and Indians, and that, in 1625, they invited the Jesuits\r\nto aid them. In 1629, the joint mission came to a close through the\r\nsurrender of Quebec to the English. When the mission was reopened in\r\n1632, Jesuits alone were in charge, their operations being at first\r\nconfined to the neighboring Montagnais, although they soon spread\r\nthroughout the entire Canadian field. In 1658, Bishop Laval founded\r\nthe Seminary of Quebec, whereupon the Jesuits resigned their parishes\r\namong the colonists, and thereafter confined themselves to their\r\ncollege and the Indian missions. In addition to their parish work, the\r\npriests of the seminary conducted missions in Acadia, Illinois, and on\r\nthe lower Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe year following the return of the Jesuits to Canada, Father Buteux,\r\nof that order, began his labors at Three Rivers, which was a convenient\r\ngathering-place for the fur trade. The village was frequently raided\r\nby Iroquois, but remained until the fall of New France one of the\r\nprominent centers of missionary influence. The efforts of Buteux, which\r\nlasted until his death at the hands of Iroquois in 1652, met with\r\nconsiderable success. His custom, like that of the other missionaries,\r\nwas to be present at the French posts during the annual trading\r\n\"meets,\" and when the savages returned to the wilderness, to accompany\r\nsome selected band. In thus following the nomadic tribes, he made some\r\nof the longest and most toilsome journeys recorded in the annals of the\r\nSociety of Jesus, and shared with his flock all the horrors of famine,\r\npestilence, and inter-tribal war.\r\n\r\nIt was soon realized by the missionaries that but meagre results could\r\nbe obtained until the Indians were induced to lead a sedentary life.\r\nTheir wandering habit nullified all attempts at permanent instruction\r\nto the young; it engendered improvidence and laziness, bred famine and\r\ndisease; and the constant struggle to kill fur-bearing animals for\r\ntheir pelts rapidly depleted the game, while the fur trade wrought\r\ncontamination in many forms. Missionary efforts were at first conducive\r\nto the interests of the fur trade, by bringing far-distant tribes\r\nwithin the sphere of French influence; but so soon as the Jesuit\r\nsought to change the habits of the natives, to cause them to become\r\nagriculturists instead of hunters, and to oppose the rum traffic\r\namong them, then the grasping commercial monopoly which controlled\r\nthe fortunes of New France, and was merely \"working\" the colony for\r\nfinancial gains, saw in the Jesuit an enemy, and often placed serious\r\nobstacles in his path.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the sedentary policy, and also to protect the wretched\r\nMontagnais from Iroquois war-parties, the Jesuits, in 1637, established\r\nfor them a palisaded mission four miles above Quebec, at first\r\ngiving it the name St. Joseph, but later that of Sillery, in honor\r\nof Commander Noël Brulart de Sillery, of France, who had given ample\r\nfunds for the founding of this enterprise. Here were at first gathered\r\ntwenty of the Indians, who began cultivation of the soil, varied by\r\noccasional hunting and fishing trips, which the missionaries could not\r\nprevent. The little town slowly grew in importance, both Algonkins and\r\nMontagnais being represented in its population. Three years later,\r\nnuns opened a hospital at Sillery, for the reception of both French\r\nand Indian patients, and thus greatly added to the popularity of\r\nthe mission. But in 1646 the nuns removed their hospital to Quebec;\r\na few years later, the church and mission house were destroyed by\r\nfire; disease made sad havoc in the settlement; the thin soil became\r\nexhausted through careless tillage; Iroquois preyed upon the converts,\r\nuntil at last the Algonkins almost entirely disappeared; and although\r\ntheir place was taken by Abenakis from Maine and Acadia, until the\r\nattendance became almost solely Abenaki, the enterprise waned. In\r\n1685, it was abandoned in favor of St. Francis de Sales, a new mission\r\nestablished at the falls of the Chaudière River, not far from the St.\r\nLawrence. Beyond a monument of later days, to the memory of Fathers\r\nMassé and De Nouë, whose names are prominently connected with this\r\nwork, nothing now remains to mark the site of the old Sillery mission.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Francis, the mission work began to spread into Maine. Of\r\nits character and extent there, mention has already been made. St.\r\nFrancis achieved a certain measure of prosperity, as Indian missions\r\ngo. It became in time a source of serious trouble to the New England\r\nborderers, for many a French and Indian war-party was here fitted out\r\nagainst the latter, during the series of bloody conflicts which marked\r\nthe three-quarters of a century previous to the fall of New France.\r\nFinally, in September, 1759, Maj. Robert Rogers descended upon the\r\nvillage with his famous rangers, and in retaliation pillaged and burned\r\nthe houses, and killed \"at least two hundred Indians.\" New France\r\nsoon after fell into the hands of the English, and, the Jesuits being\r\nsuppressed, we hear little more of St. Francis de Sales.\r\n\r\nIn 1641, the missionary settlement of Montreal was founded by\r\nMaisonneuve. The Jesuits were the first resident clergy, and soon began\r\nmission work among the neighboring Indians and those who resorted\r\nthither from the valleys of the Lower St. Lawrence and the Ottawa.\r\nSoon, however, the Sulpitians, established in Paris by the Abbé Olier,\r\none of the Society of Montreal, took charge of the mission on Montreal\r\nIsland, which in after years was moved to the Sault au Récollet, and\r\nthence to the Lake of the Two Mountains, where there was gathered a\r\npolyglot village composed of Iroquois, Algonkins, and Nipissings. Upon\r\nthe opening of the English régime, the Jesuit and Récollet missions\r\nwere suppressed, but those of the Sulpitians were undisturbed, so that\r\nthis mission at the lake is the oldest now extant in Canada.\r\n\r\nAmong the Algonkins of the Ottawa River (or Grande Rivière), no\r\npermanent missions were attempted by any of the orders. Long the chief\r\nhighway to the West, the river was familiar to travelling missionaries,\r\nwho frequently ministered to the tribesmen along its banks, either at\r\nthe native villages or during the annual trading councils at the French\r\nposts of Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE HURON MISSION.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the advent of the French, the Hurons (or Wyandots),\r\nallied in origin and language to the Iroquois, numbered about 16,000\r\nsouls, and dwelt in several large villages in a narrow district on the\r\nhigh ground between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay of Lake Huron. Their\r\ndwellings were bark cabins, clustered within stoutly-palisaded walls,\r\nand near each fortified town were fields of corn, beans, pumpkins,\r\nand tobacco. Agricultural in habit, keen traders, and in the main\r\nsedentary, these semi-naked savages made short hunting and fishing\r\nexpeditions, and laid up stores for the winter. They were better\r\nfighters than the Algonkins around them, yet were obliged gradually\r\nto withdraw northward and westward from Iroquois persecution, and\r\nduring the period of the Jesuit missions were almost annihilated by\r\nthe latter. To the southwest, across a wide stretch of unpopulated\r\nforest, were the allies and kindred of the Hurons, the Tionontates,\r\ncalled also Petuns, or Tobacco Nation, a term having its origin in\r\ntheir custom of cultivating large fields of tobacco, which commodity\r\nthey used in a wide-spread barter with other tribes. To the southeast\r\nof the Petuns, west of Lake Ontario and on both sides of the gorge of\r\nNiagara, were the peaceful Atiwandaronks, who, being friends alike of\r\nIroquois, Algonkins, and Hurons, were known as the Neutral Nation. To\r\nthe eastward of the Neutrals, strongly intrenched in the interlocking\r\nbasins of the Genesee and the Mohawk, lay the dread confederacy of the\r\nIroquois, who in time were to spread like a pestilence over the lands\r\nof all their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence and mobility of the Hurons rendered the early\r\nprospects for missionary effort among them more promising than with\r\nthe rude and nomadic Algonkins. But while at first the missionaries\r\nof New France were well received, the innate savagery of these people\r\nin time asserted itself. Their medicine-men, as bitterly fanatical as\r\nthe howling dervishes of the Orient, plotted the destruction of the\r\nmessengers of the new faith; the introduction of European diseases\r\nwas attributed to the \"black gowns;\" the ravages of the Iroquois were\r\nthought to be brought on by the presence of the strangers; the rites\r\nof the church were looked upon as infernal incantations, and the lurid\r\npictures of the Judgment, which were displayed in the little forest\r\nchapels, aroused unspeakable terror among this simple people; finally,\r\nan irresistible wave of superstitious frenzy led to the blotting out of\r\nthe mission, accompanied by some of the most heart-rending scenes in\r\nthe history of Christian evangelization.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in 1615 the Récollet friar, Joseph le\r\nCaron, made his way into the far-away country of the Hurons, but\r\nreturned in the following year, having learned much of their language\r\nand customs. Five years later, another of his order, William Poulin,\r\ntook up the weary task, being joined in 1623 by Fathers Le Caron and\r\nNicholas Viel, and the historian of the Récollet missions, Brother\r\nGabriel Sagard. All of them soon left the field, however, save Viel,\r\nwho alone, amid almost incredible hardships, attained some measure of\r\nsuccess; but in 1625, when descending the Ottawa to meet and arrange\r\nfor co-operation with the Jesuit Brébeuf, at Three Rivers, he was\r\nwillfully drowned by his Indian guide in the last rapid of Des Prairies\r\nRiver, just back of Montreal. Such is the origin of the name of the\r\ndread Sault au Récollet.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, the Jesuits Brébeuf and Anne de Nouë, having received some\r\nlinguistic instruction from Récollets who had been in the Huron field,\r\nproceeded thither, with a Récollet friar, Joseph de la Roche Daillon,\r\nto resume the work which the Récollets had abandoned. Daillon attempted\r\na mission to neighboring Neutrals, but, being roughly handled by\r\nthem, rejoined his Jesuit friends among the Hurons. Two years later,\r\nhe returned to Quebec, having been preceded by De Nouë, who found it\r\nimpossible to master the difficult language of their dusky flock.\r\nBrébeuf, now left alone, labored gallantly among these people, and,\r\nwinning the hearts of many by his easy adoption of their manners,\r\ngathered about him a little colony of those favorably inclined to his\r\nviews. He was recalled to Quebec in 1629, arriving there just in time\r\nto fall into the hands of Louis Kirk, and be transported to England.\r\n\r\nWhen Canada was restored to France, by the treaty of St. Germain, the\r\nJesuits were given sole charge of the Indian missions, but it was 1634\r\nbefore the Huron mission could be reopened. In September, Brébeuf,\r\nAntoine Daniel, and Davost returned to Brébeuf's old field, and\r\ncommenced, in the large town of Ihonatiria, the greatest Jesuit mission\r\nin the history of New France. Others soon joined them. Additional\r\nmissions were opened in neighboring towns, some of the strongest of\r\nthese being each served by four fathers, who were assisted by laymen\r\ndonnés, or given men; while in the cultivation of the soil, and the\r\nfashioning of implements and utensils both for the fathers and for the\r\nIndians, numerous hired laborers, from the French colonies on the St.\r\nLawrence, were employed in and about the missions. Charles Garnier and\r\nIsaac Jogues, with their attendants, made a tour of the Petun villages;\r\nother Jesuits were sent among the Neutrals; and even the Algonkins as\r\nfar northwestward as Sault Ste. Marie were visited (1641) by Raymbault\r\nand Jogues, and looked and listened with awe at the celebration of the\r\nmass. In 1639, there was built, on the River Wye, the fortified mission\r\nhouse of St. Mary's, to serve as a center for the wide-spread work, as\r\na place for ecclesiastical retreat for the fathers, and a refuge when\r\nenemies pressed too closely upon them.\r\n\r\nThe story of the hardships and sufferings of the devoted missionaries,\r\nas told us by Rochemonteix, Shea, and Parkman, and with rare modesty\r\nrecorded in the documents to be contained in this series, is one of\r\nthe most thrilling in the annals of humanity. Space forbids us here\r\nto dwell upon the theme. No men have, in the zealous exercise of\r\ntheir faith, performed hardier deeds than these Jesuits of the Huron\r\nmission; yet, after three years of unremitting toil, they could (1640)\r\ncount but a hundred converts out of a population of 16,000, and these\r\nwere for the most part sick infants or aged persons, who had died\r\nsoon after baptism. The rugged braves scorned the approaches of the\r\nfathers, and unmercifully tormented their converts; the medicine-men\r\nwaged continual warfare on their work; smallpox and the Iroquois were\r\ndecimating the people.\r\n\r\nJogues was (1642) sent down to the colonies for supplies for the\r\nmissions, but with his Huron companions was captured by an Iroquois\r\nwar-party, who led them to the Mohawk towns. There most of the Hurons\r\nwere killed, and Jogues and his donné, René Goupil, were tortured\r\nand mutilated, and made to serve as slaves to their savage jailers.\r\nFinally Goupil, a promising young physician, was killed, and Jogues,\r\nbeing rescued by the Dutch allies of the Mohawks, was sent to Europe.\r\nSupplies thus failing them, the Huron missionaries were in a sad plight\r\nuntil finally (1644) relieved by an expedition to the lower country\r\nundertaken at great hazards by Brébeuf, Garreau, and Noël Chabanel. The\r\nsame season, Francis Joseph Bressani, attempting to reach the Huron\r\nmissions, had been captured and tortured by Mohawks; like Jogues, he\r\nwas rescued through Dutch intercession and sent back to Europe, but\r\nboth of these zealots were soon back again facing the cruel dangers of\r\ntheir chosen task.\r\n\r\nA temporary peace followed, in 1645, and the hope of the Jesuits was\r\nrekindled, for they now had five missions in as many Huron towns, and\r\nanother established for Algonkins who were resident in the Huron\r\ndistrict. But in July, 1648, the Iroquois attacked Teanaustayé, the\r\nchief Huron village, and while encouraging the frenzied defense Father\r\nDaniel lost his life at the hands of the enemy. He was thus the first\r\nJesuit martyr in the Huron mission, and the second in New France,--for\r\nJogues had been tortured to death in the Iroquois towns, two years\r\nbefore. The spirit of the Hurons was crushed in this bloody foray;\r\nlarge bands, deserting their towns, fled in terror to seek protection\r\nof the Petuns, while others made their way to the Manitoulin Islands of\r\nLake Huron, and even as far west as the islands of Green Bay and the\r\nmatted pine forests of Northern Wisconsin. Here and there a town was\r\nleft, however, and one of the largest of these, called St. Ignatius\r\nby the Jesuits, was stormed by a thousand Iroquois, March 16, 1649.\r\nThe three survivors fled through the woods to neighboring St. Louis,\r\nwhere were Brébeuf, now grown old in his service of toil, and young\r\nGabriel Lalemant. Bravely did they aid in defending St. Louis, and\r\nadministering to wounded and dying; but at last were captured, and\r\nbeing taken to the ruined town of St. Ignatius were most cruelly\r\ntortured until relieved by death. Early in November, Fathers Garnier\r\nand Chabanel met their death in the Petun country, the former at the\r\nhands of Iroquois, the latter being killed by a Huron who imagined that\r\nthe presence of the Jesuits had brought curses upon his tribe.\r\n\r\nThe missions in the Huron country were now entirely abandoned. A\r\nfew of the surviving Jesuits followed their flocks to the islands\r\nin Lake Huron; but in June, 1650, the enterprise was forsaken, and\r\nthe missionaries, with a number of their converts, retired to a\r\nvillage, founded for them, on the Island of Orleans, near Quebec. This\r\nsettlement being in time ravaged by the Iroquois, a final stand was\r\nmade at Lorette, also in the outskirts of Quebec, which mission exists\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nThe great Huron mission, which had been conducted for thirty-five\r\nyears, had employed twenty-nine missionaries, of whom seven had lost\r\ntheir lives in the work. This important field forsaken, many of the\r\nmissionaries had returned to Europe disheartened, and apparently\r\nthe future for Jesuit missions in New France looked gloomy enough.\r\nThe Iroquois had now practically destroyed the Montagnais between\r\nQuebec and the Saguenay, the Algonkins of the Ottawa, and the Hurons,\r\nPetuns, and Neutrals. The French colonies of Quebec, Three Rivers,\r\nand Montreal, had suffered from repeated raids of the New York\r\nconfederates, and their forest trade was now almost wholly destroyed.\r\nIn this hour of darkness, light suddenly broke upon New France.\r\nThe politic Iroquois, attacked on either side by the Eries and the\r\nSusquehannas, and fearing that while thus engaged their northern\r\nvictims might revive for combined vengeance, sent overtures of peace to\r\nQuebec, and cordially invited to their cantonments the once detested\r\nblack gowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE IROQUOIS MISSION.\r\n\r\nChamplain had early made enemies of the Iroquois, by attacking them\r\nas the allies of his Algonkin neighbors. This enmity extended to all\r\nNew France, and lasted, with brief intervals of peace, for over half\r\na century. We have seen that Jogues was the first of his order (1642)\r\nto enter the Iroquois country, as a prisoner of the Mohawks, the\r\neasternmost of the five tribes of the confederacy. Two years later,\r\nBressani, while on his way to the Huron missions, was also captured by\r\nthe Mohawks, passed through a similar experience of torture, was sold\r\nto the Dutch, and transported back to France, and, again like Jogues\r\nresumed his hazardous task of attempting to tame the American savage.\r\nDuring the first peace (May, 1646), Jogues, now in civilian costume,\r\npaid a brief visit to his former tormentors on the Mohawk, this time\r\nconveying only expressions of good-will from the governor of New\r\nFrance. His political errand accomplished, he returned to Quebec; but\r\nin August was back again, with a young French attendant named Lalande,\r\nintent on opening admission among the Iroquois. Meanwhile, there had\r\nbeen a revulsion of sentiment on their part, and the two Frenchmen had\r\nno sooner reached the Mohawk than they were tortured and killed.\r\n\r\nDuring an Iroquois attack upon Quebec, seven years later (1653),\r\nFather Joseph Anthony Poncet was taken prisoner by the marauders and\r\ncarried to the Mohawk, where he suffered in the same manner as his\r\npredecessors; but his captors being now desirous of a renewal of\r\npeace with the French, spared his life, and sent him back to Quebec\r\nwith overtures for a renewal of negotiations. Early in July, 1654,\r\nFather Simon le Moyne was sent forth upon a tour of inspection, and\r\nreturned to Quebec in September, with glowing reports of the fervor\r\nof his reception by both Mohawks and Onondagas. It was determined to\r\nrear a mission among the latter, and thither (1655),--a four weeks'\r\nvoyage,--proceeded Claude Dablon and Peter Mary Joseph Chaumonot;\r\nwhile, to appease the jealous Mohawks, Le Moyne at the same time\r\nreopened a brief but unprosperous mission among that tribe.\r\n\r\nAt first, Dablon and Chaumonot had high hopes of their Onondaga\r\nenterprise; but mistrust soon arose in the minds of the natives,\r\nand Dablon found it necessary to proceed to Quebec and obtain fresh\r\nevidences of the friendship of the French. He returned in the early\r\nsummer of 1656, accompanied by Fathers Francis Le Mercier, superior of\r\nthe Canadian mission, and René Ménard, two lay brothers, and a party\r\nof French colonists under a militia captain, who designed founding\r\na settlement in the land of the Iroquois. By the close of the year,\r\nthe work was in a promising stage; a number of Christianized Hurons,\r\nwho had been adopted into the confederacy, formed a nucleus for\r\nproselyting, several Iroquois converts had been made, and all five of\r\nthe tribes had been visited by the missionaries.\r\n\r\nFathers Paul Ragueneau and Joseph Imbert Dupéron, who had been sent\r\nout from Quebec in July, 1657, to assist the Onondaga mission, reached\r\nit only after many perils en route; for meanwhile, there had been\r\na fresh Iroquois uprising against the Hurons and Ottawas, in which\r\nFather Leonard Garreau lost his life near Montreal, and the entire\r\nconfederacy was soon in an uproar against the white allies of its\r\nancient enemies. The intrepid Le Moyne joined the party in November,\r\nand in the following March (1658), on learning that all of the French\r\nhad been condemned to death, the entire colony stole away in the night,\r\nand reached Montreal only after a long and hazardous voyage. The great\r\nIroquois mission, which had promised so happily and cost so much in\r\nblood and treasure, was now thought to be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, still another chapter to the story. In the summer\r\nof 1660, after two years of bloody forays against New France, a Cayuga\r\nsachem, who had been converted at Onondaga, came to Montreal as a peace\r\nmessenger, asking for another black gown to minister to the native\r\nconverts and a number of French captives in the Iroquois towns. Once\r\nmore, Le Moyne cheerfully set out upon what seemed a path to death; but\r\nhe passed the winter without molestation, and in the spring following\r\nwas allowed to return to Canada with the French prisoners.\r\n\r\nIt was five years later (1665), before the government of New France\r\nfelt itself sufficiently strong to threaten chastisement of the raiding\r\nIroquois, who had long been making life a torment in the colonies on\r\nthe St. Lawrence. The Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas sued\r\nfor peace; but the Mohawks were obstinate, and their villages were\r\nwasted by fire until they too asked for mercy and the ministrations of\r\nthe Jesuits. Fathers James Fremin, James Bruyas, and John Pierron were\r\nsent out in 1667; later, they were assisted by Julian Garnier, Stephen\r\nde Carheil, Peter Milet, and Boniface, so that by the close of 1668 a\r\nmission was in progress in each of the five cantonments. A few notable\r\nconverts were made, among them Catharine Tegakouita, known as the\r\n\"Iroquois saint;\" Catharine Ganneaktena, an Erie captive who afterwards\r\nfounded a native mission village on the banks of the St. Lawrence;\r\nthe head-men Assendasé, Kryn, and Soenrese. But a great success\r\nwas never possible; here as elsewhere, the vices and superstitions\r\nof the tribesmen were deep-rooted, and they had not yet reached\r\na stage of culture where the spiritual doctrines of Christianity\r\nappealed strongly, save to a few emotional natures. The converts\r\nwere subjected to so many annoyances and dangers, that isolation\r\nwas thought essential, and there was established for them opposite\r\nMontreal the palisaded mission of St. Francis Xavier; this settlement,\r\nfostered by the French as a buffer against Iroquois attack on the\r\ncolonists, was subsequently removed to Sault St. Louis, and is known\r\nin our day as Caughnawaga. This mission, and that of the Sulpitians on\r\nMontreal Mountain--later removed to the neighboring Lake of the Two\r\nMountains,--and at Quinté Bay, were frequently recruited by Iroquois\r\nChristians, who were carefully instructed by the missionaries in the\r\narts of agriculture and the rites of the church.\r\n\r\nThis depletion of the Iroquois population alarmed the sachems of the\r\nconfederacy. To please them, Governor Dongan of New York, himself a\r\nCatholic, introduced to the Five Nations three English Jesuits, who\r\nsought in vain to counteract the movement. The French did not abandon\r\nthe Iroquois mission-field until 1687, when the rising power of the\r\nEnglish obliged them to withdraw from the country. We have, however,\r\nglimpses of occasional attempts thereafter to revive the work, Bruyas\r\nbeing on the ground in 1701, joined the following year by James de\r\nLamberville, Garnier, and Le Valliant, and later by James d'Hue\r\nand Peter de Marieul. The entire party were again driven from the\r\ncantonments in 1708, De Marieul being the last of his order to remain\r\non duty.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the Jesuits were chiefly devoted to their mission at\r\nCaughnawaga, whither many Iroquois retreated before the inroads of\r\nDutch and English settlers who were now crowding upon their lands. When\r\nthe black gowns were at last expelled from New France, secular priests\r\ncontinued their work among the remnants of those New York Indians who\r\nhad sought protection by settling among the French colonists on the St.\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE OTTAWA MISSION.\r\n\r\nThis embraced the tribes beyond Lake Huron,--the Chippewas at Sault\r\nSte. Marie, the Beavers, the Crees, the Ottawas and refugee Hurons\r\non Lake Superior, the Menomonees, Pottawattomies, Sacs, Foxes,\r\nWinnebagoes, Miamis, Illinois, and those of the Sioux who lived on or\r\nnear the banks of the Mississippi. The Ottawas were the first Indians\r\nfrom the upper lakes to trade with the French, hence that vast district\r\nbecame early known as the country of the Ottawas.\r\n\r\nThe Huron mission was the door to the Ottawa mission. Jogues and\r\nRaimbault were with the Chippewas at Sault Ste. Marie in 1641; but it\r\nwas nineteen years after that (1660), before they were followed by\r\nanother Jesuit, the veteran Father Ménard, who accompanied an Ottawa\r\nfleet up the great river of that name, through Lake Huron and the\r\nSault, and on to Keweenaw Bay, where he said the first mass heard\r\non the shores of the northern sea. After a wretched winter on that\r\ninhospitable coast, spent in a shanty of fir boughs, with savage\r\nneighbors who reviled his presence, he proceeded inland intent on\r\nministering to some Hurons who had fled from Iroquois persecution to\r\nthe gloomy pine forest about the upper waters of Black River, in what\r\nis now Wisconsin. In August, 1661, he lost his life at a portage, thus\r\nbeing the first martyr upon the Ottawa mission.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Claude Alloüez set out for Lake Superior, and\r\nreaching Chequamegon Bay in October (1665), built a little chapel of\r\nbark upon the southwest shore of that rock-bound estuary,--the famous\r\nmission of La Pointe. His flock was a medley, Hurons and Algonkins here\r\nclustering in two villages, where they lived on fish, safe at last\r\nfrom the raging Iroquois, although much pestered by the wild Sioux of\r\nthe West. For thirty years did Alloüez travel from tribe to tribe,\r\nthrough the forests and over the prairies of the vast wilderness which\r\na century later came to be organized into the Northwest Territory, and\r\nestablished missions at Green Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, on the Miami, and,\r\nwith Marquette, among the Illinois at Kaskaskia.\r\n\r\nLater, there arrived on the scene Fathers Louis Nicholas, James\r\nMarquette, Dablon, Louis André, Druillettes, Albanel, and others. The\r\nfield of the Northwest seemed at first, as did the Huron mission,\r\nhighly promising. The missionaries were everywhere greeted by large\r\naudiences, and much curiosity was displayed concerning the rites of\r\nthe church; but, as usual, the nomadic habits of the Indians rendered\r\ninstruction difficult. The fathers, with great toil and misery, and\r\nsubject to daily danger and insult, followed their people about upon\r\nlong hunting and fishing expeditions; and even when the bands had\r\nreturned to the squalid villages, life there was almost as comfortless\r\nas upon the trail. Among the donnés and the Jesuit coadjutor brothers\r\nwere skillful workers in metal, who repaired the guns and utensils of\r\nthe natives, and taught them how best to obtain and reduce the ore from\r\nlead and copper deposits. We have evidence that the copper region\r\nof Lake Superior was at times resorted to by the lay followers and\r\ntheir Indian attendants, to obtain material for crucifixes and for the\r\nmedals which the missionaries gave to converts; and in the lead mines\r\ncentering about where are now Dubuque, Iowa, and Galena, Ill., the\r\nmissionary attendants and Indians obtained lead for barter with French\r\nfur-traders, who, like the soldiers of the Cross, were by this time\r\nwandering all over the Northwest.\r\n\r\nMarquette had succeeded Alloüez at La Pointe, in 1669; but it was\r\nnot long before the Hurons and Ottawas of Chequamegon Bay foolishly\r\nincurred the fresh hostility of the Sioux, and the following year\r\nwere driven eastward like autumn leaves before a blast. Marquette\r\nestablished them in a new mission, at Point St. Ignace, opposite\r\nMackinaw; and it was from here that, in 1673, he joined the party of\r\nLouis Joliet, en route to the Mississippi River. The St. Ignace mission\r\nbecame the largest and most successful in the Northwest, there being\r\nencamped there, during Marquette's time, about 500 Hurons and 1,300\r\nOttawas. The interesting story of Marquette, a familiar chapter in\r\nAmerican history, will be fully developed in the documents of this\r\nseries; and we shall be able to present for the first time a facsimile\r\nof the original MS. Journal of his final and fatal voyage (1674), which\r\nis preserved among the many treasures of the Jesuit College of St.\r\nMary's, in Montreal.\r\n\r\nAfter the suspension of the publication of the _Relations_, in 1673,\r\nwe obtain few glimpses of the Ottawa mission, save in the occasional\r\nreferences of travelers. The several local missions in the district\r\nwere, in the main, probably more successful than those in any of the\r\nother fields of endeavor. La Pointe, Green Bay; St. Ignace (later\r\nMackinac), Sault Ste. Marie, St. Joseph's, and Kaskaskia became the\r\nmost important of them all; and at some of these points Catholic\r\nmissions are still maintained by Franciscan friars and secular priests,\r\nfor resident French Creoles and Indians. The uprising of the Foxes\r\nagainst French power, which lasted spasmodically from about 1700 to\r\n1755, greatly hampered the work of the Jesuits; they did not, during\r\nthis period, entirely absent themselves from the broad country of the\r\nOttawas, but conversions were few and the records slight.\r\n\r\nThere was, for a time, governmental attempt to supplant the Western\r\nJesuits with Récollets. Several friars were with La Salle, who had\r\na great antipathy to the disciples of Loyola,--Father Hennepin's\r\nadventures belong to this period of Récollet effort, his colleagues at\r\nFort Crèvecoeur being Brothers Ribourde and Membré; but their mission\r\nclosed with the Iroquois repulse of the French from Crèvecoeur, and\r\nthe consequent death of Ribourde. When La Salle retired from the\r\nregion, Alloüez resumed the Illinois mission of the Jesuits; and soon\r\nafter there arrived upon the ground Fathers Gravier, Marest, Mermet,\r\nand Pinet, who, because of the more docile character of the tribes\r\ncollectively known as the Illinois,--Kaskaskias, Cahokias, Peorias,\r\nand Tamaroas,--found here a relatively fruitful field. In time, French\r\nsettlements grew up around the palisaded missions, intermarriages\r\noccurred, and the work flourished for many years. Black gowns visited\r\nthe prosperous Illinois towns as late as 1781, when the death of Father\r\nMeurin closed the work of his order in the Northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE LOUISIANA MISSION.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Marquette was in Louisiana in 1673, but established no\r\nmission. Nine years later, Membré, of the Récollets, accompanied\r\nLa Salle into the region, and instructed natives as far down the\r\nMississippi as the mouth; and with La Salle at his death were\r\nAnastasius Douay, of the Récollets, and the Sulpitian Cavalier. In\r\n1698, Francis Jolliet de Montigny and Anthony Davion, priests of the\r\nSeminary of Quebec, established missions on the Yazoo, among the\r\nNatchez, and elsewhere in the neighborhood; to their aid, soon came\r\nothers of their house,--St. Côme, Gaulin, Fonçault, and Erborie, who\r\nlabored until about 1710, when, St. Côme and Fonçault being killed by\r\nroving Indians, the survivors retired to the North. The Jesuit Du Rue\r\naccompanied Iberville into the country in 1699-1700, followed by De\r\nLimoges and Dongé, of his order, their work continuing until about 1704.\r\n\r\nIn 1721, Father Charlevoix reported that but two priests were then\r\nin Louisiana, one at Yazoo and another in New Orleans; at the latter\r\npost, a chaplain of some sort was established throughout the French\r\nrégime. Capuchins and Jesuits were both admitted to Louisiana, in\r\n1722, the former to serve as priests to the French of the country,\r\nchiefly at New Orleans and Natchez, while the Jesuits were restricted\r\nto the Indian missions, although permitted to maintain a house in the\r\noutskirts of New Orleans. It was not long before the Illinois mission\r\nbecame attached to Louisiana, and missionaries for that field usually\r\nentered upon their work by way of the New Orleans house. Missions were\r\nmaintained in the villages of the Arkansas, Yazoo, Choctaws, and\r\nAlibamons; but the uprising of the Indians in the Natchez district, in\r\n1727, led to the fall of these several missions, together with that\r\nof French colonies above New Orleans. Father Du Poisson was killed\r\nby savages at Natchez, where he was temporarily supplying the French\r\nsettlers in the absence of their Capuchin friar; Souel fell a victim\r\nto the Yazoos, at whose hands Doutreleau narrowly escaped destruction.\r\nHowever, the Jesuits did not despair, but soon returned to the Lower\r\nMississippi, where they continued their labors until about 1770,\r\nalthough the order had in 1762 been suppressed in France.\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana mission of the Jesuits, while producing several martyrs,\r\nand rich in striking examples of missionary zeal, has yielded but\r\nmeagre documentary results; few of the papers in the present series\r\ntouch upon its work, and indeed detailed knowledge thereof is not\r\neasily obtainable. Severed from Canada by a long stretch of wilderness,\r\ncommunication with the St. Lawrence basin was difficult and spasmodic,\r\nand in the case of the Jesuits generally unnecessary; for, having their\r\nown superior at New Orleans, his allegiance was to the general of the\r\norder in France, not to his fellow-superiors in Quebec and Montreal.\r\nThe several missions of New France played a large part in American\r\nhistory; that of Louisiana, although interesting, is of much less\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nA few explorers like Champlain, Radisson, and Perrot have left valuable\r\nnarratives behind them, which are of prime importance in the study\r\nof the beginnings of French settlement in America; but it is to the\r\nJesuits that we owe the great body of our information concerning the\r\nfrontiers of New France in the seventeenth century. It was their\r\nduty annually to transmit to their superior in Quebec, or Montreal,\r\na written journal of their doings; it was also their duty to pay\r\noccasional visits to their superior, and to go into retreat at the\r\ncentral house of the Canadian mission. Annually, between 1632 and 1673,\r\nthe superior made up a narrative, or _Relation_, of the most important\r\nevents which had occurred in the several missionary districts under\r\nhis charge, sometimes using the exact words of the missionaries, and\r\nsometimes with considerable editorial skill summarizing the individual\r\njournals in a general account, based in part upon the oral reports\r\nof visiting fathers. This annual _Relation_, which in bibliographies\r\noccasionally bears the name of the superior, and at other times of the\r\nmissionary chiefly contributing to it, was forwarded to the provincial\r\nof the order in France, and, after careful scrutiny and re-editing,\r\npublished by him in a series of duodecimo volumes, known collectively\r\nas _The Jesuit Relations_.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the journals which formed the basis of the _Relations_\r\nwere for the most part men of trained intellect, acute observers, and\r\npractised in the art of keeping records of their experiences. They\r\nhad left the most highly civilized country of their times, to plunge\r\nat once into the heart of the American wilderness, and attempt to win\r\nto the Christian faith the fiercest savages known to history. To gain\r\nthese savages, it was first necessary to know them intimately,--their\r\nspeech, their habits, their manner of thought, their strong points and\r\ntheir weak. These first students of the North American Indian were\r\nnot only amply fitted for their undertaking, but none have since had\r\nbetter opportunity for its prosecution. They were explorers, as well\r\nas priests. Bancroft was inexact when he said, in oft-quoted phrase,\r\n\"Not a cape was turned, not a river entered, but a Jesuit led the\r\nway.\" The actual pioneers of New France were almost always coureurs de\r\nbois, in the prosecution of the fur trade; but coureurs de bois, for\r\nobvious reasons, seldom kept records, even when capable of doing so,\r\nand as a rule we learn of their previous appearance on the scene only\r\nthrough chance allusions in the _Relations_. The Jesuits performed\r\na great service to mankind in publishing their annals, which are,\r\nfor historian, geographer, and ethnologist, among our first and best\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nMany of the _Relations_ were written in Indian camps, amid a chaos of\r\ndistractions. Insects innumerable tormented the journalists, they were\r\nimmersed in scenes of squalor and degradation, overcome by fatigue and\r\nlack of proper sustenance, often suffering from wounds and disease,\r\nmaltreated in a hundred ways by hosts who, at times, might more\r\nproperly be called jailers; and not seldom had savage superstition\r\nrisen to such a height, that to be seen making a memorandum was certain\r\nto arouse the ferocious enmity of the band. It is not surprising\r\nthat the composition of these journals of the Jesuits is sometimes\r\ncrude; the wonder is, that they could be written at all. Nearly always\r\nthe style is simple and direct. Never does the narrator descend to\r\nself-glorification, or dwell unnecessarily upon the details of his\r\ncontinual martyrdom; he never complains of his lot; but sets forth\r\nhis experience in phrases the most matter-of-fact. His meaning is\r\nseldom obscure. We gain from his pages a vivid picture of life in the\r\nprimeval forest, as he lived it; we seem to see him upon his long canoe\r\njourneys, squatted amidst his dusky fellows, working his passage at the\r\npaddles, and carrying cargoes upon the portage trail; we see him the\r\nbutt and scorn of the savage camp, sometimes deserted in the heart of\r\nthe wilderness, and obliged to wait for another flotilla, or to make\r\nhis way alone as best he can. Arrived at last, at his journey's end,\r\nwe often find him vainly seeking for shelter in the squalid huts of\r\nthe natives, with every man's hand against him, but his own heart open\r\nto them all. We find him, even when at last domiciled in some far-away\r\nvillage, working against hope to save the unbaptized from eternal\r\ndamnation; we seem to see the rising storm of opposition, invoked\r\nby native medicine-men,--who to his seventeenth-century imagination\r\nseem devils indeed,--and at last the bursting climax of superstitious\r\nfrenzy which sweeps him and his before it. Not only do these devoted\r\nmissionaries,--never, in any field, has been witnessed greater personal\r\nheroism than theirs,--live and breathe before us in the _Relations_;\r\nbut we have in them our first competent account of the Red Indian, at\r\na time when relatively uncontaminated by contact with Europeans. We\r\nseem, in the _Relations_, to know this crafty savage, to measure him\r\nintellectually as well as physically, his inmost thoughts as well as\r\nopen speech. The fathers did not understand him from an ethnological\r\npoint of view, as well as he is to-day understood; their minds were\r\ntinctured with the scientific fallacies of their time. But, with what\r\nis known to-day, the photographic reports in the _Relations_ help the\r\nstudent to an accurate picture of the untamed aborigine, and much\r\nthat mystified the fathers, is now, by aid of their careful journals,\r\neasily susceptible of explanation. Few periods of history are so well\r\nilluminated as the French régime in North America. This we owe in large\r\nmeasure to the existence of the Jesuit _Relations_.\r\n\r\nWhat are generally known as the _Relations_ proper, addressed\r\nto the superior and published in Paris, under direction of the\r\nprovincial, commence with Le Jeune's _Brieve Relation du Voyage de la\r\nNouvelle-France_ (1632); and thereafter a duodecimo volume, neatly\r\nprinted and bound in vellum, was issued annually from the press\r\nof Sebastien Cramoisy, in Paris, until 1673, when the series was\r\ndiscontinued, probably through the influence of Frontenac, to whom\r\nthe Jesuits were distasteful. The _Relations_ at once became popular\r\nin the court circles of France; their regular appearance was always\r\nawaited with the keenest interest, and assisted greatly in creating\r\nand fostering the enthusiasm of pious philanthropists, who for many\r\nyears substantially maintained the missions of New France. In addition\r\nto these forty volumes, which to collectors are technically known\r\nas \"Cramoisys,\" many similar publications found their way into the\r\nhands of the public, the greater part of them bearing date after the\r\nsuppression of the Cramoisy series. Some were printed in Paris and\r\nLyons by independent publishers; others appeared in Latin and Italian\r\ntexts, at Rome, and other cities in Italy; while in such journals as\r\n_Mercure François_ and _Annuæ Litteræ Societatis Jesu_, occasionally\r\nwere published letters from the missionaries, of the same nature as the\r\n_Relations_, but briefer and more intimate in tone.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, however, that popular interest in these\r\npublications materially affected the secular literature of the period;\r\nthey were largely used in Jesuit histories of New France, but by others\r\nwere practically ignored. General literary interest in the _Relations_\r\nwas only created about a half century ago, when Dr. E. B. O'Callaghan,\r\neditor of the _Documentary History of New York_, called attention to\r\ntheir great value as storehouses of contemporary information. Dr.\r\nJohn G. Shea, author of _History of the Catholic Missions among the\r\nIndian Tribes of the United States_, and Father Felix Martin, S. J., of\r\nMontreal, soon came forward, with fresh studies of the _Relations_.\r\nCollectors at once commenced searching for Cramoisys, which were found\r\nto be exceedingly scarce,--most of the originals having been literally\r\nworn out in the hands of their devout seventeenth-century readers;\r\nfinally, the greatest collector of them all, James Lenox, of New York,\r\noutstripped his competitors and laid the foundation, in the Lenox\r\nLibrary, of what is to-day probably the only complete collection in\r\nAmerica. In 1858, the Canadian government reprinted the Cramoisys, with\r\na few additions, in three stout octavo volumes, carefully edited by\r\nAbbés Làverdière, Plante, and Ferland. These, too, are now rare, copies\r\nseldom being offered for sale.\r\n\r\nThe Quebec reprint was followed by two admirable series brought\r\nout by Shea and O'Callaghan respectively. Shea's _Cramoisy Series_\r\n(1857-1866), numbers twenty-five little volumes, the edition of\r\neach of which was limited to a hundred copies, now difficult to\r\nobtain; it contains for the most part entirely new matter, chiefly\r\n_Relations_ prepared for publication by the superiors, after 1672,\r\nand miscellaneously printed; among the volumes, however, are a few\r\nreprints of particularly rare issues of the original Cramoisy press.\r\nThe O'Callaghan series, seven in number (the edition limited to\r\ntwenty-five copies), contains different material from Shea's, but of\r\nthe same character. A further addition to the mass of material was\r\nmade by Father Martin, in _Relations Inédites de la Nouvelle-France_,\r\n1672-79 (2 vols., Paris, 1861); and by Father Carayon in _Première\r\nMission des Jésuites au Canada_ (Paris, 1864). In 1871, there was\r\npublished at Quebec, under the editorship of Abbés Laverdière and\r\nCasgrain, _Le Journal des Jésuites_, from the original manuscript in\r\nthe archives of the Seminary of Quebec (now Laval University). The\r\nmemoranda contained in this volume,--a rarity, for the greater part\r\nof the edition was accidentally destroyed by fire,--were not intended\r\nfor publication, being of the character of private records, covering\r\nthe operations of the Jesuits in New France between 1645 and 1668. The\r\n_Journal_ is, however, an indispensable complement of the _Relations_.\r\nIt was reprinted by a Montreal publisher (J. M. Valois) in 1892, but\r\neven this later edition is already exhausted. Many interesting epistles\r\nare found in _Lettres Édifiantes et Curieuses, écrites des Missions\r\nÉtrangères_, which cover the Jesuit missions in many lands, between the\r\nyears 1702 and 1776; only a small portion of this publication (there\r\nare several editions, ranging from 1702-1776 to 1875-77) is devoted to\r\nthe North American missions.\r\n\r\nAmerican historians, from Shea and Parkman down, have already made\r\nliberal use of the _Relations_, and here and there antiquarians and\r\nhistorical societies have published fragmentary translations. The\r\ngreat body of the _Relations_ and their allied documents, however, has\r\nnever been Englished. The text is difficult, for their French is not\r\nthe French of the modern schools; hence these interesting papers have\r\nbeen doubly inaccessible to the majority of our historical students.\r\nThe present edition, while faithfully reproducing the old French text,\r\neven in most of its errors, offers to the public for the first time, an\r\nEnglish rendering side by side with the original.\r\n\r\nIn breadth of scope, also, this edition will, through the generous\r\nenterprise of the publishers, readily be first in the field. Not only\r\nwill it embrace all of the original Cramoisy series, the Shea and\r\nO'Callaghan series, those collected by Fathers Martin and Carayon, the\r\n_Journal des Jésuites_, and such of the _Lettres Édifiantes_ as touch\r\nupon the North American missions, but many other valuable documents\r\nwhich have not previously been reprinted; it will contain, also,\r\nconsiderable hitherto-unpublished material from the manuscripts in the\r\narchives of St. Mary's College, Montreal, and other depositories. These\r\nseveral documents will be illustrated by faithful reproductions of all\r\nthe maps and other engravings appearing in the old editions, besides\r\nmuch new material obtained especially for this edition, a prominent\r\nfeature of which will be authentic portraits of many of the early\r\nfathers, and photographic facsimiles of pages from their manuscript\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to each volume will be given such Bibliographical\r\nData concerning its contents, as seem necessary to the scholar. The\r\nappended Notes consist of historical, biographical, archæological, and\r\nmiscellaneous comment, which it is hoped may tend to the elucidation of\r\nthe text. An exhaustive General Index to the English text will appear\r\nin the final volume of the series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO VOL. I\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a dramatic unity in the Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents,\r\nas they will be presented in this series. Commencing with a report of\r\nthe first conversion of savages in New France, in 1610, by a secular\r\npriest, and soon drifting into the records of Jesuit missionary effort,\r\nthey touch upon practically every important enterprise of the Jesuits,\r\nin Canada and Louisiana, from the coming of Fathers Biard and Massé, in\r\n1611, to the death, in the closing decade of the eighteenth century, of\r\nFather Well, \"the last Jesuit of Montreal.\"\r\n\r\nI. The series fitly opens with Lescarbot's _La Conversion des\r\nSavvages_. Marc Lescarbot, a Paris lawyer, a Huguenot poet as well as\r\nhistorian, and in many respects a picturesque character in the early\r\nscenes of our drama, adroitly seeks in this document to convince the\r\nCatholic Queen of France that his Huguenot patrons, De Monts and\r\nPoutrincourt, are so wisely ordering affairs in their New World domain\r\nthat not only will the glory of France be enhanced, but the natives\r\nbe won to Christ through the medium of the Church; for it was part of\r\nthe agreement entered into with the Crown, by these adventurers, that\r\nwhile their colonists should be permitted to have Huguenot ministers,\r\nthe aborigines must be converted only by Catholic priests. To this end,\r\nLescarbot describes with unction the sudden conversion by a secular\r\npriest, Messire Jessé Fléché, of old Chief Membertou and twenty other\r\nMicmacs, and their formal baptism on the beach at Port Royal. The\r\nobject is, of course, to ward off the threatened invasion of New France\r\nby the Jesuits, by showing how thoroughly the work of proselyting is\r\nbeing carried forward without their aid.\r\n\r\nII. By the same ship which, in the hands of Poutrincourt's son,\r\nBiencourt, carries to France this ingenious document, one Bertrand,\r\na Huguenot layman, sends a message to his friend, the Sieur de\r\nla Tronchaie. In his _Lettre Missive_, M. Bertrand describes the\r\nconversion of Membertou and his fellow savages, and speaks with\r\nenthusiasm of the new country: as well he may, for in Volume II. we\r\nshall find Lescarbot testifying that in Paris the worthy Bertrand was\r\n\"daily tormented by the gout,\" while at Port Royal he was \"entirely\r\nfree\" from it.\r\n\r\nIII. Lescarbot's fervid description of Father Fléché's conversions\r\ndid not succeed in keeping the Jesuits from New France. The present\r\ndocument is a letter written at Dieppe, by Father Pierre Biard, of the\r\nSociety of Jesus, to his general at Rome, telling of the adventures\r\nwhich had befallen Father Ennemond Massé and himself, since they,\r\nthe pioneers of their order in the New World, had been ordered from\r\nFrance to Port Royal. Certain Huguenot merchants of Dieppe conspired to\r\nprevent the passage of the Jesuits to America; but finally the queen\r\nand other court ladies, favoring the missionaries, purchased control of\r\nthe Huguenots' ship and cargo, and the exultant fathers are now on the\r\neve of sailing.\r\n\r\nIV. In this letter, written by Biard to his provincial, a few weeks\r\nafter the arrival at Port Royal, the missionary gives the details\r\nof his voyage, describes the spiritual and material condition\r\nof Poutrincourt's colony, and outlines plans for work among the\r\nIndians--only Huguenot ministers being, as yet, allowed under the\r\ncharter to serve the spiritual needs of the colonists themselves.\r\n\r\nV. In this letter, Biard notifies his general of the safe arrival of\r\nMassé and himself.\r\n\r\nVI. A like duty is here performed by Massé.\r\n\r\nVII. Father Jouvency, one of the eighteenth-century historians of the\r\nSociety of Jesus, herein gives an historical account of the Canadian\r\nmissions of his order, in 1611-13; and, by way of comparison, tells of\r\nthe condition of the same missions in 1703, ending with a list of the\r\nJesuit missions in North America in the year 1710, the date of original\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nVIII. Herein, Jouvency gives a detailed account of the Indian tribes of\r\nCanada,--their customs, characteristics, superstitions, etc. Although\r\nnot in strict chronological order, these chapters are given here as\r\nbeing from the same work as the foregoing.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of several of the Notes to Volume I., the Editor has\r\nhad some assistance from Mrs. Jane Marsh Parker, of Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  R. G.

Nous scavons par les histoires que\r\nla voix des Apôtres a eclaté par tout le monde de deça dés il y a\r\nplusieurs siecles passez, quoy qu'aujourd'hui les royaumes Chrétiens\r\nen soient la moindre partie. Mais quant au nouveau monde decouvert\r\ndepuis environ six-vingts ans, nous n'auons aucun vestige que la\r\nparole de Dieu y ait onques [8] esté annoncée avant ces derniers\r\ntemps, si ce n'est que nous voulions adjouter quelque foy à ce que\r\nIehan de Leri rapporte, que comme il racontoit vn jour aux Bresiliens\r\nles grandes merveilles de Dieu en la creation du monde, & mysteres\r\nde nôtre redemption, vn vieillart lui dit qu'il auoit oui dire à son\r\ngrand pere qu'autrefois vn homme barbu (or les Bresiliens ne le sont\r\npoint) estoit venu vers eux, & leur avoit dit choses semblables: mais\r\nqu'on ne le voulut point écouter, & depuis s'estoi[~e]t entre-tuez &\r\nmangez les vns les autres. Quant aux autres nations de dela quelques\r\nvns ont bien quelque sourde nouvelle du deluge, & de l'immortalité\r\ndes ames, ensemble dela beatitude des bi[~e]vivans apres cette vie,\r\nmais ils peuvent avoir retenu cette obscure doctrine de main en main\r\npar tradition depuis le cataclisme vniversel qui avint au temps de\r\nNoé. Reste donc à deplorer la miserable condition de ces peuples\r\nqui occupent vne terre si grande, que le monde de deça ne vient en\r\ncomparaison avec elle, si nous comprenons la terre qui est outre le\r\ndetroit de Magellan dite, [9] _Terra del fugo_, tant en son etenduë\r\nvers la Chine, & le Iapan, que vers la Nouvelle Guinée: comme aussi\r\ncelle qui est outre la grande riviere de Canada, qui s'estend vers\r\nl'Orient & est baignée de la grande mer Occidentale. Toutes lesquelles\r\ncontrees sont en vne miserable ignorance, & n'y a point d'apparence\r\nqu'elles aient onques eu le v[~e]t de l'Evangile, sinon qu'en ce\r\ndernier siecle l'Hespagnol parmi la cruauté & l'avarice y a apporté\r\nquelque lumiere de la religion Chrétienne. Mais cela est si peu\r\nde chose, qu'on n'en peut pas faire si grand estat qu'il pourroit\r\nsembler, d'autant que par la confession méme de ceux qui en ont écrit\r\nles histoires ils ont preque tué tous les naturels du païs, & en fait\r\nnombre vn certain historien, de plus de vingt millions, dés il y a\r\nsoixante dix ans. L'Anglois depuis vingt-cinq ans a pris pié en vne\r\nterre qui git entre la Floride, & le païs des Armouchiquois, laquelle\r\nterre a esté appellée Virginie en l'honneur de la defuncte Royne\r\nd'Angleterre.

Peu apres que i'eu\r\npublié mon Histoire de la Nouvelle France on fit vn embarquem[~e]t\r\nde huit cens hommes pour y envoyer. Il n'est point mention qu'ils se\r\nsoient lavé les mains au sang de ces peuples. En quoy ils ne sont ni\r\nà loüer, ni à blamer: car il n'y a aucune loy, ni aucun pretexte,\r\nqui permette de tuer qui que ce soit, & méme ceux des biens desquelz\r\nnous-nous emparons. Mais ils sont à priser s'ils montrent à ces\r\npauvres ignorans le chemin de salut par la vraye & non fardée doctrine\r\nEvangelique. Quant à noz François ie me suis assez plaint en madite\r\nHistoire de la poltronnerie du temps d'aujourd'huy, & du peu de zele\r\nque nous avons soit à redresser ces pauvres errans, soit à faire que\r\nle nom de Dieu soit coneu exalté & glorifié en ces terres d'outre mer,\r\noù jamais il ne le fut. Et toutefois nous voulons que cela porte le\r\nnom de France, nom tant auguste & venerable, que nous ne pouvons sans\r\nhonte nous glorifier d'vne France qui n'est point Chrétienne. Ie sçay\r\nqu'il ne manque pas de gens de bõne volonté pour y aller. Mais pourquoy\r\n[11] l'Eglise, qui possede tant de biens; mais pourquoy les Grands,\r\nqui sont tant de depenses superflues, ne financent-ilz quelque chose\r\npour l'execution d'vn si sainct oeuvre? Deux Gentils-hommes pleins\r\nde courage en ces derniers t[~e]ps se sont trouvez zelés à ceci, les\r\nSieurs de Monts, & de Poutrincourt, lesquels à leurs dépens se sont\r\nenervés, & ont fait plus que leurs forces ne pouvoient porter. L'vn\r\n& l'autre ont continué jusques à present leurs voyages. Mais l'vn a\r\nesté deceu par deux fois, & est tombé en grand interest pour s'estre\r\nrendu trop credule aux paroles de quelques vns. Or d'autant que les\r\ndernieres nouvelles que nous avons de nôtre Nouvelle-France viennent\r\nde la part du Sieur de Poutrincourt, nous dirons ici ce qui est de son\r\nfait: & avons iuste sujet d'exalter son courage, entant que ne pouvant\r\nviure parmi la tourbe des hommes oisifs, dont nous n'abondons que\r\ntrop; & voyant nôtre France comme languir au repos d'vn calme ennuieux\r\naux hõmes de travail: apres avoir en mille occasions fait preuve de\r\nsa valeur depuis vingt quatre ans ença; il a voulu coroner [12] ses\r\nlabeurs vrayement Herculeens par la cause de Dieu, pour laquelle\r\nil employe ses moyens & ses forces, & va hazardant sa vie, pour\r\naccroitre le nombre des citoyens des cieux, & amener à la bergerie de\r\nIesus-Christ nôtre souverain Pasteur, les brebis egarées, lesquelles il\r\nseroit bien-seant aux Prelats de l'Eglise d'aller recuillir (du moins\r\ncontribuer à cet effect) puis qu'ils en ont le moyen. Mais avec combien\r\nde travaux s'est-il employé jusques ici à cela? Voici la troisieme\r\nfois qu'il passe le grand Ocean pour parvenir à ce but. La premiere\r\nannée se passa avec le sieur de Monts à chercher vne demeure propre &\r\nvn port asseuré pour la retraite des vaisseaux & des hommes. Ce qui\r\nne succeda pas bien. La seconde année fut employée à la mesme chose,\r\n& lors il estoit en France. En la troisieme nous fimes epreuve de la\r\nterre, laquelle nous rendit abondamment le fruict de nôtre culture:\r\nCette annee icy voyant par vne mauvaise experience que les hommes sont\r\ntrompeurs, il ne s'est plus voulu attendre à autre qu'à luy-méme, &\r\n[s']est mis en mer le 26. Fevrier, ayant eu [13] temps fort contraire\r\nen sa navigation, laquelle a esté la plus longue dont i'aye jamais ouï\r\nparler. Certes la nôtre nous fut fort ennuieuse il y a trois ans, ayans\r\nesté vagabons l'espace de deux mois & demi sur la mer avant qu'arriver\r\nau Port Royal. Mais en cette-ci ils ont esté trois mois entiers. De\r\nsorte qu'vn indiscret se seroit mutiné jusques à faire de mauvaises\r\nconspirations: toutesfois la benignité dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt &\r\nle respect du lieu où il demeuroit à Paris, lui ont serui de bouclier\r\npour luy garentir la vie. [_Terrir, c'est à dire decouvrir la terre._]\r\nLa premiere côte où territ iceluy Sieur de Poutrincourt fut au port au\r\nMouton. De là parmi les brouïllas qui sont fort frequens le long de\r\nl'Eté en cette mer, il se trouva en quelques perils, principalement\r\nvers le Cap de Sable, où son vaisseau pensa toucher sur les brisans.\r\n[_Hist. de la Nouvelle-France liv._ 2. _chap._ 37. _p._ 527.] Depuis\r\nvoulant gaigner le Port Royal, il fut porté par la violence des vents\r\nquarante lieuës par-dela, c'est à sçavoir à la riviere de Norombega\r\ntant celebrée & fabuleusement décrite par les Geographes & Historiens,\r\nainsi que i'ay monstré en madite Histoire, là où se pourra voir cette\r\nnavigation par la Table geographique [14] que i'y ay mise. De-là il\r\nvint à la riviere sainct Iehan qui est vis à vis du Port Royal pardela\r\nla Baye Françoise, où il trouva vn navire de S. Malo, qui troquoit avec\r\nles Sauvages du païs. Et là il eut plainte d'vn Capitaine Sauvage qu'vn\r\ndudit navire lui auoit ravi sa femme, & en abusoit: dont ledit Sieur\r\nfit informer, & print celui là prisonnier, & le navire aussi. Mais il\r\nlaissa aller ledit navire & les matelots se contentant de garder le\r\nmalfaiteur: lequel neantmoins s'evada dans vne chaloupe & se retira\r\navec les Sauvages, les detournant de l'amitié des François, comme nous\r\ndirons ci-apres. En fin arriués audit Port Royal il ne se peut dire\r\navec combien de ioye ces pauvres peuples receurent ledit Sieur & sa\r\ncompagnie. Et de verité le sujet de cette ioye estoit d'autant plus\r\ngrand qu'ils n'avoient plus d'esperance de voir les François habiter\r\naupres d'eux, desquels ils auoient ressenti les courtoisies lors que\r\nnous y estions, dont se voyans priués, aussi pleuroient ils à chaudes\r\nlarmes quand nous partimes de là il y a trois ans. En ce Port Royal est\r\nla demeure [15] dudict sieur de Poutrincourt, le plus beau sejour que\r\nDieu ait formé sur la terre, remparé d'un rang de 12 ou 15. lieuës de\r\nmontagnes du côté du Nort, sur lesquelles bat le Soleil tout le iour: &\r\nde cotaux au côte du Su, ou Midi: lequel au reste peut contenir vingt\r\nmilles vaisseaux en asseurance, ayant vingt brasses de profond à son\r\nentrée, vne lieuë & demie de large, & quatre de long jusques à vne ile\r\nqui a vne lieuë Françoise de circuit: dans lequel i'ay veu quelquefois\r\nà l'aise noüer vne moyenne Baleine, qui venoit auec le flot à huict\r\nheures au matin par chacun jour. Au reste dans ce port se peche en la\r\nsaison grande quantité de harens, d'eplans, (ou eperlans) sardines,\r\nbars, moruës, loups-marins, & autre poissons: & quant aux coquillages,\r\non y recueille force houmars, crappes, palourdes, coques, moules,\r\nescargots, & chatagines de mer. Mais qui voudra aller au dessus du\r\nflot de la mer il pechera en la riviere force eturgeons & saumons, à\r\nla dessaicte desquels il y a vn singulier plaisir. Or pour reprendre\r\nnôstre fil, le Sieur de Poutrincourt arrivé [6 i.e. 16] là a trouvé\r\nses batimens tout entiers sans que les Sauvages (ainsi a-on appellé\r\nces peuples là iusques à maintenant) y eussent touché en aucune façon,\r\nny méme aux meubles qu'on y avoit laissé. Et soucieux de leurs vieux\r\namis ils demandoient comme vn chacun d'eux se portoit, les nommant\r\nparticulierement par leurs noms communs, & demandans pourquoy tels &\r\ntels n'y estoient retournez. Ceci demontre vne grãde debõnaireté en\r\nce peuple, lequel aussi ayant en nous reconu toute humanité, ne nous\r\nfuit point; comme il fait l'Hespagnol en tout ce grand monde nouveau.\r\nEt consequemment par vne douceur & courtoisie, qui leur est aussi\r\nfamiliere qu'à nous, il est aisé de les faire plier à tout ce que l'on\r\nvoudra, & particulierement pour ce qui touche le point de la Religion,\r\nde laquelle nous leur avions baillé de bonnes impressiõs lors que nous\r\nestions aupres d'eux, & ne desiroient pas mieux que de se ranger souz\r\nla banniere de Iesus-Christ: à quoy ils eussent esté receuz dés lors,\r\nsi nous eussions eu vn pié ferme en la terre. Mais comme nous pensions\r\ncontinuer, [17] avint que le sieur de Monts ne pouvant plus fournir à\r\nla depense, & le Roy ne l'assistant point, il fut contraint de revoquer\r\ntous ceux qui estoient pardelà, lesquels n'avoient porté les choses\r\nnecessaires à vne plus longue demeure. Ainsi c'eust esté temerité\r\n& folie de conferer le baptéme à ceux qu'il eust fallu par apres\r\nabandonner, & leur donner sujet de retourner à leur vomissement. Mais\r\nmaintenant que c'est à bon escient, & que ledit sieur de Poutrincourt\r\nfait pardelà sa demeure actuelle, il est loisible de leur imprimer le\r\ncharactere Chrétien sur le front & en l'ame, apres les avoir instruit\r\nés principaux articles de nôtre Foy. [_Aux Hebr._ 11. _vers._ 6.] Ce\r\nqu'a eu soin de faire ledit Sieur, sachant ce que dit l'Apôtre, que\r\n_celuy qui s'approche de Dieu doibt croire que Dieu est_: & apres cette\r\ncroyance, peu à peu on vient aux choses qui sont plus eloignées du sens\r\ncommun, comme de croire que d'vn rien Dieu ait fait toutes choses,\r\nqu'il se soit fait homme, qu'il soit nay d'vne Vierge, qu'il ait voulu\r\nmourir pour l'homme, &c. Et d'autant que les hommes Ecclesiastics qui\r\nont esté portés pardelà ne sont encore [18] instruits en la langue\r\nde ces peuples, ledit Sieur a pris la peine de les instruire & les\r\nfaire instruire par l'organe de son fils ainé jeune Gentilhomme qui\r\nentend & parle fort bien ladite langue, & qui s[~e]ble estre né pour\r\nleur ouvrir le chemin des cieux. Les hommes qui sont au Port Royal, &\r\nterres adjacentes tirant vers la Terre-neuve, s'appellent Souriquois,\r\n& ont leur langue propre. Mais passée la Baye Françoise, qui a environ\r\n40. lieuës de profond dans les terres, & 10. ou 12. lieuës de large,\r\nles hommes de l'autre part s'appellent Etechemins, & plus loin sont\r\nles Armouchiquois peuple distingué de langage de ceux-ci, & lequel\r\nest heureux en quãtité de belles vignes & gros raisins, s'il sçavoit\r\nconoitre l'vtilité de ce fruit, lequel (ainsi que nos vieux Gaullois)\r\nil pense estre poison. [_Ammian Marcellin._] Il a aussi de la chãve\r\nexcellente que la nature lui donne, laquelle en beauté and bõté passe\r\nde beaucoup la nôtre: & outre ce le Sassafras, force chenes, noyers,\r\npruniers, chataigniers, & autres fruits qui ne sont venus à nôtre\r\nconoissance. Quant au Port Royal ie veux confesser qu'il n'y a pas\r\n[19] tant de fruits: & neantmoins la terre y est plantureuse pour y\r\nesperer tout ce que la France Gaulloise nous produit. Tous ces peuples\r\nse gouvernent par Capitaines qu'ils appellent Sagamos, mot qui est\r\npris és Indes Orientales en méme signification, ainsi que i'ay leu\r\nen l'histoire de Maffeus, & lequel i'estime venir du mot Hebrieu\r\n_Sagan_, qui signifie Grand Prince, selon Rabbi David, & quelquefois\r\ncelui qui tient le second lieu apres le souverain Pontife. [_Esai._\r\n41. _vers._ 25, _Ierem._ 51. _vers._ 23. _Santes Pagnin_, 9.] En\r\nla version ordinaire de la Bible il est pris pour le Magistrat: &\r\nneantmoins là méme les interpretes Hebrieux le tourn[~e]t Prince.\r\nEt de fait nous lisons dans Berose que Noé fut appellé Saga tant\r\npour ce qu'il estoit grand Prince, que pour ce qu'il avoit enseigné\r\nla Theologie, & les ceremonies du service divin, avec beaucoup de\r\nsecrets, des choses natureles, aux Scytes Armeniens, que les anciens\r\nCosmographes appellerent Sages du nom de Noé. Et paraventure pour\r\ncette méme consideration ont esté appellés nos Tectosages, qui sont\r\nles Tolosains. Car ce bon pere restaurateur du monde vint en Italie,\r\n& envoya [20] repeupler les Gaulles apres le Deluge, donnant son nom\r\nde Gaulois (car Xenophon dit qu'il fut aussi appellé de ce nom) à ceux\r\nqu'il y envoya, par ce qu'il avoit esté echappé des eaux. Et n'est\r\npas inconvenient que lui-méme n'ait imposé le nom aux Tectosages.\r\nRevenons à nôtre mot de Sagamos lequel est le tiltre d'honneur des\r\nCapitaines en ces Terres neuves dont nous parlons. Au Port Royal le\r\nCapitaine, ou Sagamos dudit lieu s'appelle en son nom Membertou. Il\r\nest âgé de cent ans pour le moins, & peut naturellement vivre encore\r\nplus de cinquante. Il a sous soy plusieurs familles, ausquelles il\r\ncommande, non point avec tant d'authorité que fait nôtre Roy sur ses\r\nsujets, mais pour haranguer, donner conseil, marcher à la guerre, faire\r\nraison à celui qui reçoit quelque injure, & choses s[~e]blables. Il\r\nne met point d'impost sur le peuple. Mais s'il y a de la chasse il\r\nen a sa part sans qu'il soit tenu d'y aller. Vray est qu'on lui fait\r\nquelquefois des presens de peaux de Castors, ou autre chose, quand il\r\nest employé pour la guerison de quelque malade, ou pour interroger [21]\r\nson dæmon (qu'il appelle _Aoutem_) afin d'auoir nouvelle de quelque\r\nchose future, ou absente: car chaque village, ou compagnie de Sauvages,\r\nayant vn _Aoutmoin_, c'est à dire Devin, qui fait cet office, Membertou\r\nest celui qui de grande ancienneté à prattiqué cela entre ceux parmi\r\nlesquels il a conversé. Si bien qu'il est en credit pardessus tous les\r\nautres Sagamos du païs, aiãt dés sa jeunesse esté grand Capitaine, &\r\nparmi cela exercé l'office de Devin & de Medecin, qui sont les trois\r\nchoses plus efficaces à obliger les hommes, & à se rendre necessaire\r\nen ceste vie humaine. Or ce Membertou aujourd'huy par la grace de Dieu\r\nest Chrétien avec toute sa famille, aiant esté baptizé, & vingt autres\r\napres lui, le jour sainct Iehan dernier 24. Iuin. I'en ay lettres dudit\r\nSieur de Poutrincourt en datte du vnzieme jour de Iuillet ensuivant.\r\nLedit Membertou a esté nommé du nom de nôtre feu bon Roy HENRY IIII.\r\n& son fils ainé du nom de Monseigneur le Dauphin aujourd'huy nôtre\r\nRoy LOVIS XIII. que Dieu benie. Et ainsi consequemment la femme de\r\nMembertou a [22] esté nommée MARIE du nom de la Royne Regente, & à sa\r\nfille a esté imposé le nom de la Roine MARGVERITE. Le second fils de\r\nMembertou dit Actaudin fut nommé PAVL du nom de nôtre sainct Pere le\r\nPape de Rome. La fille du susdit Louis eut nom CHRISTINE en l'honneur\r\nde Madame la soeur ainee du Roy. Et consequemment à chacun fut imposé\r\nle nom de quelque illustre, ou notable personnage de deça. Plusieurs\r\nautres Sauvages estoient lors allez cabanner ailleurs (comme c'est\r\nleur coutume de se disperser par bendes quand l'esté est venu) lors\r\nde ces solennitez de regeneration Chrétienne, lesquels nous estimons\r\nestre aujourd'huy enrollés en la famille de Dieu par le méme lavem[~e]t\r\ndu sainct bapteme. Mais le diable, qui iamais ne dort, en ceste\r\noccurrence ici a témoigné la jalousie qu'il avoit du salut annoncé à\r\nce peuple, & de voir que le nom de Dieu fust glorifié en cette terre:\r\nayant suscité vn mauvais François, non François, mais Turc: non Turc,\r\nmais Athée, pour detourner du sentier de salut plusieurs Sauvages qui\r\nestoient Chrétiens en leur ame & de [23] volonté dés il y a trois ans:\r\n& entre autres vn Sagamos nommé ChKoudun homme de grand credit, duquel\r\ni'ay fait honorable m[~e]tion en mon Histoire de la Nouvelle-Frãce,\r\npar ce que je l'ay veu sur tous autres aymer les François, & qu'il\r\nadmiroit nos inventions au pris de leur ignorance: mémes que s'estant\r\nquelquefois trouvé aux remontrances Chrétiennes qui se faisoient par-de\r\nlà à noz Frãçois par chacun Dimanche, il s'y rendoit attentif, encores\r\nqu'il n'y ent[~e]dist rien: & davantage avoit pendu devant sa poitrine\r\nle signe de la Croix, lequel il faisoit aussi porter à ses domestics\r\n& avoit à nôtre imitation planté vne grande Croix en la place de son\r\nvillage dit _Oigoudi_, sur le port de la riuiere sainct Iehan, à dix\r\nlieuës du port Royal. Or cet homme avec les autres, a esté détourné\r\nd'estre Chrétien par l'avarice maudite de ce mauvais François que\r\ni'ay touché ci-dessus, lequel ie ne veux nõmer pour cette heure pour\r\nl'amour & reverence que ie porte à son pere, mais avec protestation de\r\nl'eterniser s'il ne s'amende. Celui-là, di-ie, pour attraper quelques\r\nCastors de ce Sagamos [24] ChKoudun, l'alla en Iuin dernier suborner,\r\napres s'estre euadé des mains dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt, disãt que\r\ntout ce qu'icelui Poutrincourt leur disoit de Dieu n'estoit rien qui\r\nvaille, qu'il ne le falloit point croire, & que c'estoit vn abuseur, &\r\nqu'il les feroit mourir pour avoir leurs Castors. Ie laisse beaucoup\r\nde mechans discours qu'il peut avoir adjouté à cela. S'il estoit de la\r\nReligion de ceux qui se disent Reformez ie l'excuserois aucunement:\r\nmais il mõtre bien qu'il n'est ni de l'vne, ny de l'autre. Si diray-ie\r\ntoutefois qu'il a sujet de remercier Dieu du dãger où il s'est veu en\r\nnôtre voiage. Ce Sagamos pouvoit estant Chrétien en r[~e]dre bon nombre\r\nsemblables à lui, à son imitation. Mais ie veux esperer, ou plustot\r\ncroire pour certain qu'il ne demeurera plus gueres long t[~e]ps en cet\r\nerreur, & que ledit Sieur aura trouvé moyen de l'attirer (avec beaucoup\r\nd'autres) pres de soy, pour luy imprimer derechef les vives persuasions\r\ndont il luy avoit autrefois touché l'ame en ma presence. Car l'esprit\r\nde Dieu est puissant pour faire tõber sur ce champ vne nouvelle rousee,\r\nqui fera regermer ce que la grele a desseché & abbatu. Dieu vueille par\r\nsa grace conduire le tout en sorte que la chose reüssisse à sa gloire\r\n& à l'edification de ce peuple, pour lequel tous Chrétiens doivent\r\nfaire continuelles prieres à sa divine bonté, à ce qu'il lui plaise\r\nconfirmer & avancer l'oeuvre qu'il lui a pleu susciter en ce temps pour\r\nl'exaltation de son nom, & le salut de ses creatures.\r\n\r\nFIN.\r\n\r\n[25] Il y a pardela des hommes d'Eglise de bon sçavoir que le seul\r\nzele de la Religion y a porté, lesquels ne manqueront de faire tout ce\r\nque la pieté requerra en ce regard. Or quant à present il n'est pas\r\nbesoin de ces Docteurs sublimes, qui peuvent estre plus vtiles pardeça\r\nà combattre les vices & les heresies. Ioint qu'il y a certaine sorte\r\nde gens desquels on ne se peut pas bien asseurer faisans métier de\r\ncensurer tout ce qui ne vient à leurs maximes, & voulans commander par\r\ntout. Il suffit d'estre veillé au dehors sans avoir de ces epilogueurs\r\nqui considerent tous les mouvemens de vôtre corps & de vôtre coeur\r\npour en faire regitres, desquels les plus grands Rois mémes ne se\r\npeuv[~e]t defendre. Et puis, que serviroi[~e]t pardela tãt de gens de\r\ncette sorte, quãt à present, si ce n'est qu'ils voulussent s'addonner\r\nà la culture de la terre? Car ce n'est pas tout que d'aller là. Il\r\nfaut considerer ce que l'on y fera y estant arrivé. Pour ce qui est\r\nde la demeure du Sieur de Poutrincourt il s'est fourni au depart de\r\nce qui lui estoit necessaire. Mais s'il prenoit envie à quelques gens\r\nde bien d'y [26] avancer l'Evangile, ie seroy d'avis qu'ils fissent\r\ncinq ou six bandes, avec chacun vn navire bien equippé, & qu'ils\r\nallassent planter des colonies en diverses places de ces quartiers\r\nlà, comme à Tadoussac, Gachepé, Campseau, la Héve, Oigoudi, Saincte\r\nCroix, Pemptegoet, KinibeKi, & autres endroits où sont les assemblées\r\nde Sauvages, lesquels il faut que le temps ameine à la Religion\r\nChrétienne: si ce n'est qu'vn grand Pere de famille tel que le Roy\r\nen vueille avoir la gloire totale, & face habiter ces lieux. Car d'y\r\npenser vivre à leur mode i'estime cela estre hors de nôtre pouvoir.\r\n[_Façon de vivre des Souriquois & Ethechemins._] Et pour le montrer,\r\nleur façon de vivre est telle, que depuis la premiere terre (qui est\r\nla Terre-neuve) insques aux Armouchiquois, qui sont pres de trois cens\r\nlieuës, les hommes vivent vagabons, sans labourage, n'estans iamais\r\nplus de cinq ou six semaines en vn lieu. Pline à fait mention de\r\ncertains peuples dits Ichthyophages, c'est à dire Mangeurs de poissons,\r\nviuans de cela. Ceux ci sont tout de méme les trois parts de l'année.\r\nCar venant le Print[~e]ps ils se divisent par troupes sur les rives\r\nde mer insques à [27] l'Hiver, lequel venãt, par ce que le poissõ se\r\nretire au fond des grandes eaux salées, ilz cherchent les lacs & ombres\r\ndes bois, où ilz pechent les Castors, dont ilz viv[~e]t, & d'autres\r\nchasses, comme Ellans, Caribous, Cerfs, & autres animaux moindres que\r\nceux-lá. Et neantmoins quelquefois, en Eté méme ilz ne laissent point\r\nde chasser: & d'ailleurs ont infinie quantité d'oyseaux en certaines\r\niles és mois de May, Iuin, Iuillet, & Aoust. [_le coucher._] Quant à\r\nleur coucher, vne peau etendue sur la terre leur sert de matelas. Et\r\nen cela n'avons dequoy nous mocquer d'eux, par ce que noz vieux peres\r\nGaullois en faisoient de méme, & dinoi[~e]t aussi sur des peaux de\r\nchiens & de loups, si Diodore & Strabon disent vray. [_Armouchiquois._]\r\nMais quant au pais des Armouchiquois & Iroquois, il y a plus grande\r\nmoisson à faure pour ceux qui sont poussez d'vn zele religieux, par\r\nce que le peuple y est beaucoup plus frequent, & cultive la terre,\r\nde laquelle il retire vn grand soulagement de vie. Vray est qu'il\r\nn'entent pas bien la façõ de faire le pain, n'ayant les inventiõs des\r\nmoulins, ni du levain, ni des fours; ains broye son blé en certaine\r\nfaçon de [28] mortiers, & l'empâte au mieux qu'il peut pour le faire\r\ncuire entre deux pierres echauffées au feu: ou bien rotit ledit blé en\r\nepic sur la braise, ainsi que faisoient les vieux Romains, au dire de\r\nPline. [_Plin. liv._ 18. _chap._ 2. _&_ 10.] Depuis on trouva le moyen\r\nde faire des gateaux souz la cendre: & depuis encore les boulengers\r\ntrouverent la façon des fours. Or ces peuples cultivans la terre sont\r\narretés, ce que les autres ne sont point, n'ayans rien de propre, tels\r\nqu'estoient les Allemans au temps de Tacite, lequel a décrit leurs\r\nanciennes façons de vivre. [_Iroquois._] Plus avant dans les terres\r\nau dessus des Armouchiquois sont les Iroquois peuples aussi arretés,\r\npar-ce qu'ilz cultivent la terre, d'où ils recueillent du blé mahis\r\n(ou Sarazin) dés féves, des bõnes racines, & bref tout ce que nous\r\navons dit du pays desdits Armouchiquois, voire encore plus, car par\r\nnecessité ilz vivent de la terre, estans loin de la mer. Neantmoins ils\r\nont vn grand lac d'étendue merveilleuse, comme d'environ 60. lieuës,\r\nà lentour duquel ils sont cabãnés. Dans ledit lac il y a des iles\r\nbelles & grandes, habitées desdits Iroquois, qui sont vn grand peuple,\r\n& plus on va [29] avant dans les terres plus on les trouve habitées:\r\n[_Nouveau Mexique._] si bien que (s'il en faut croire les Hespagnols)\r\nau pays dit le Nouveau Mexique bien loin pardela lesdits Iroquois, en\r\ntirant au Suroüest, il y a des villes baties, & des maisons à trois &\r\nquatre etages: méme du bestial privé: d'où ils ont appellé vne certaine\r\nriviere _Rio de las Vaccas_, La riviere des Vaches, pour y en avoir\r\nveu en grand nombre paturer le lõg de la riviere. [_Grand lac outre\r\nCanada._] Et est-ce pays directement au Nort à plus de cinq cens lieuës\r\ndu vieil Mexique, avoisinant, comme ie croy, l'extremité du grand lac\r\nde la riviere de Canada, lequel (selon le rapport des Sauvages) a\r\ntrente journées de long. Ie croiroy que des hommes robustes & bien\r\ncomposés pourroient vivre parmi ces peuples là, & faire grand fruit\r\nà l'avancement de la Religion Chrétienne. Mais quant aux Souriquois,\r\n& Etechemins, qui sont vagabons & divisés, il les faut assembler par\r\nla culture de la terre, & obliger par ce moyen à demeurer en vn lieu.\r\nCar quiconque a pris la peine de cultiver vne terre il ne la quitte\r\npoint aisement. Il cõbat pour la conserver de tout son courage. [30]\r\nMais ie trouve ce dessein de longue execution si nous n'y allons\r\nd'autre zele, & si vn Roy ou riche Prince ne prent cette cause en main,\r\nlaquelle certes est digne d'vn royaume tres-Chrétien. [_Conquete de la\r\nPalestine comparee à celle de la Nouvelle-France._] On a jadis fait\r\ntant de depenses & pertes d'hommes à la reconqueste de la Palestine, à\r\nquoy on a peu proufité: & aujourd'hui à peu de frais on pourroit faire\r\ndes merveilles, & acquerir infinis peuples à Dieu sans coup ferir: &\r\nnous sommes touchés d'vne ie ne sçay quelle lethargie en ce qui est du\r\nzele religieux qui bruloit noz peres anciennement. Si on n'esperoit\r\naucun fruit temporel en ceci ie pardonnerois à l'imbecillité humaine.\r\nMais il y a de si certaines esperances d'vne bõne vsure, qu'elles\r\nferment la bouche à tous les ennemis de ce pays là, lesquels le\r\ndecrient afin de ne perdre la traite des Castors & autres pelleteries\r\ndont ils vivent, & sans cela mourroyent de faim, ou ne sçauroient à\r\nquoy s'employer. [_Au Roy & à la Royne._] Que s'il plaisoit au Roy,\r\n& à la Royne Regente sa mere, en laquelle Dieu a allume vn brasier\r\nde pieté, prendre goust à ceci (cõme certes elle a faict au rapport\r\nde la Conversiõ des Sauvages baptizés par le [31] soin du Sieur de\r\nPoutrincourt) & laisser quelque memoire d'elle, ou plustot s'asseurer\r\nde la beatitude des cieux par cette action qui est toute de Dieu, on ne\r\npeut dire quelle gloire à l'avenir ce lui seroit d'estre la premiere\r\nqui auroit planté l'Evangile en de si grandes terres, qui (par maniere\r\nde dire) n'ont point de bornes. Si Helene mere de l'Empereur Cõstantin\r\neust trouvé tant de sujet de bien-faire, elle eust beaucoup mieux\r\naimé edifier à Dieu des temples vivans que tant d'edifices de marbre\r\ndont elle a rempli la terre saincte. Et au bout l'esperance de la\r\nremuneration temporelle n'en est po[~i]t vaine. Car d'une part le Sieur\r\nde Poutrincourt demeure toujours serviteur du Roy en la terre que sa\r\nMaiesté luy a octroyée: en laquelle il seroit le rendezvous & support\r\nde tant de vaisseaux qui vont tous les ans aux Terres neuves, où ilz\r\nreçoivent mille incommodités, & en perit grand nombre, comme nous\r\navons veu & oui dire. [_Moyens pour aller aux Molucques par le Ponant\r\n& le Nort._] Dailleurs penetrant dans les terres, nous pourrions nous\r\nrendre familier le chemin de la Chine, & des Molucques par vn climat\r\n& parallele t[~e]peré, en faisant quelques statiõs ou [32] demeures\r\nau Saut de la grande riviere de Canada, puis aux lacs qui sont plus\r\noutre, le dernier desquels n'est pas loin de la grande mer Occidentale,\r\npar laquelle les Hespagnols vont aujourd'hui en l'Orient: Ou bien on\r\npouroit faire la méme entreprise par la riviere de Saguenay, outre\r\nlaquelle les Sauvages rapportent qu'il y a vne mer dont ilz n'ont veu\r\nle bout, qui est sans doute ce passage par le Nort, lequel en vain l'on\r\na tant recherché. [_Vtilités._] De sorte que nous aurions des epices,\r\n& autres drogues sans les mendier desdits Hespagnols, & demeureroit\r\nés mains du Roy le proufit qu'il tire de nous sur ces denrées:\r\nLaissant à part l'vtilité des cuirs, paturages, pecheries, & autres\r\nbiens. Mais il faut semer avant que recuillir. Par ces exercices on\r\noccuperoit beaucoup de ieunesse Françoise, dont vne partie languit ou\r\nde pauvreté, ou d'oisiveté: ou vont aux provinces etrangeres enseigner\r\nles metiers qui nous estoient iadis propres & particuliers, au moyen\r\ndequoy la France estoit remplie de biens, au lieu qu'aujourd'hui vne\r\nlongue paix ne l'a encore peu remettre en son premier lustre, tant\r\n[33] pour la raison que dessus, que pour le nombre de gens oisifs, &\r\nmendians valides & volontaires que le public nourrit. [_Chiquanerie._]\r\nEntre lesquelles incommodités on pourrait mettre encore le mal de\r\nla chiquanerie qui mange nostre nation, dõt elle a esté blamée de\r\ntout temps. A quoy [_Ammiã Marcellin._] seroit aucunement obvié par\r\nles frequ[~e]tes navigations: estant ainsi qu'une partie de ceux qui\r\nplaident auroient plustot fait de conquester nouvelle terre, demeurans\r\nen l'obeissance du Roy, que de poursuivre ce qu'ilz debattent avec\r\ntant de ruines, longueurs, solicitudes, & travaux. Et en ce ie repute\r\nheureux tous ces pauvres peuples que ie deplore ici. [_Felicité des\r\nSauvages._] Car la blafarde Envie ne les amaigrit po[~i]t ilz ne\r\nressentent point les inhumanités d'vn qui sert Dieu en torticoli, pour\r\nsouz cette couleur tourmenter les hommes; ilz ne sont point sujets au\r\ncalcul de ceux qui manquans de vertu & de bonté s'affublent d'vn faux\r\npretexte de pieté pour nourrir leur ambition. S'ilz ne conoissent point\r\nDieu, au moins ne le blasphement ilz point, comme font la pluspart des\r\nChretiens. Ilz ne sçavent que c'est d'empoisonner, ni de corrompre la\r\n[34] chasteté par artifice diabolique. Il n'y a point de pauvres, ny\r\nde mendians entre eux. Tous sont riches, entant que tous travaillent\r\n& vivent. Mais entre nous il va bien autrement. Car il y en a plus de\r\nla moitié qui vit du labeur d'autrui, ne faisant aucun metier qui soit\r\nnecessaire à la vie humaine. Que si ce païs là estoit etabli, tel y a\r\nqui n'ose faire ici ce qu'il feroit là. [_Pour ceux qui vont en la N.\r\nFrance._] Il n'ose point ici estre bucheron, laboureur, vigneron, &c.\r\npar ce que sõ pere est chiquaneur, barbier, apothicaire &c. Et là il\r\noublieroit toutes ces aprehensions de reproche, & prendroit plaisir à\r\ncultiver sa terre, ayant beaucoup de compagnons d'aussi bonne maison\r\nque lui. Et cultiver la terre c'est le metier le plus innocent, & plus\r\ncertain, exercice de ceux de qui nous sommes tous descendus, & de ces\r\nbraves Capitaines Romains qui sçavoient domter & ne point estre domtés.\r\nMais depuis que la pompe & la malice se sont introduits parmi les\r\nhommes, ce qui estoit vertu a tourné en reproche, & les faineans sont\r\nvenus en estime. [_A la Royne._] Or laissons ces gens là, & revenons au\r\nSieur de Poutrincourt, ains plustot a vous, ô Royne Tres-Chretienne,\r\n[35] la plus grande, & plus cherie des cieux que l'oeil du monde voye\r\nen la rõde qu'il fait chaque iour alentour de cet vnivers. Vous qui\r\navés le maniement du plus noble Empire dici bas, Quoy souffrirez vous\r\nde voir vn Gentil-hõme de si bonne volonté sans l'employer & sans le\r\nsecourir? Voulez vous qu'il emporte la premiere gloire du monde par\r\ndessus vous, & que le triomphe de cet affaire luy demeure sans que\r\nvous y participiés? Non, non, Madame, il faut que le tout vous en soit\r\nrapporté, & que cõme les etoilles empruntent leur lumiere du soleil,\r\naussi que du Roy & de vous qui nous l'avés dõné toutes les belles\r\nactiõs des François dep[~e]dent. Il faut donc prevenir cette gloire, &\r\nne la ceder à autre, tandis que vous avés vn Poutrincourt bon François,\r\n& qui a servi le feu Roy de regretable memoire vôtre Epoux (que Dieu\r\nabsolve) en des affaires d'Estat dont les histoires ne font mention.:\r\nEn haine dequoy sa maison & ses biens ont passé par l'examen du feu. Il\r\nne passe point l'Ocean pour voir le païs, comme ont fait préque tous\r\nles autres qui ont entrepris de semblables navigations [36] aux dépens\r\nde noz Roys. Mais il mõtre par effect quelle est son intentiõ, si bien\r\nqu'on n'en peut point douter, & ne hazarderez rien maintenant quand\r\nvôtre Majesté l'employera à bon escient à l'amplificatiõ de la religion\r\nChrétienne és terres Occidentales d'outre mer. Vous reconoissez son\r\nzele, le vôtre est incomparable, mais il faut aviser où se pourra\r\nmieux faire vôtre emploite. Ie louë les Princesses & Dames qui depuis\r\nquinze ans ont dõné de leurs biens pour le repos de ceux ou celles qui\r\nse veulent sequestrer du monde. Mais i'estime (sauf correction) que\r\nleur pieté seroit plus illustre si elle se montroit envers ces pauvres\r\npeuples Occidentaux qui gemissent, & dont le defaut d'instruction crie\r\nvengeance à Dieu contre ceux qui les peuvent ayder à estre Chrétiens,\r\n& ne le font pas. Vne Royne de Castille a esté cause que la religion\r\nChrétienne a esté portée és terres que tient l'Hespagnol en Occident:\r\nfaites ô lumiere des Roynes du monde, que par vous bientot on oye\r\neclater le nom de Dieu par tout ce monde nouveau où il n'est point\r\nencore coneu. Or reprenant le fil de mõ [37] Histoire, puisque nous\r\navons parlé du voyage dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt, il ne sera point\r\nhors de propos si apres avoir touché les incommodités & longueurs de sa\r\nnavigation, qui l'ont reculé d'vn an, nous disons vn mot du retour de\r\nson vaisseau. Ce qui sera bref, d'autant qu'ordinairement sont bréves\r\nles navigations qui se font des terres Occidentales en deça hors le\r\nTropique du Cancre. [_Liv. 1. ch._ 24. & _li._ 2. _ch._ 41. & 42.]\r\nI'ay rendu la raison de cela en mon Histoire de la Nouvelle-France,\r\noù ie renvoye le Lecteur: comme aussi pour sçavoir la raison pourquoy\r\nen Eté la mer y est remplie de brumes en telle sorte que pour vn jour\r\nserein il y en a deux de broüillas: & deux fois m'y suis trouvé parmi\r\ndes brumes de huict jours entiers. [_Que c'est ce Banc Voy la dite\r\nHistoire liv._ 2. _chap._ 24.] Ceci e esté cause que ledit Sieur de\r\nPoutrincourt renvoyant son fils en France pour faire nouvelle charge,\r\nil a demeuré aussi long temps à gaigner le grand Banc aux Moruës\r\ndepuis le Port Royal, comme à gaigner la France depuis ledit Banc: &\r\ntoutefois depuis icelui Banc jusques à la terre de France il y a huit\r\ncens bonnes lieuës: & de là méme jusques audit Port Royal il n'y en\r\na gueres [38] plus de trois cens. C'est sur ledit Banc qu'on trouve\r\nordinairement tout l'Eté force navires qui font la Pecherie des Moruës\r\nqu'on apporte pardeça, lesquelles on appelle Moruës de Terre-neuve.\r\nAinsi le fils dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt (dit le Baron de Sainct\r\nIust) arrivãt audit Banc fit provision de viande freche, & pecherie\r\nde poisson. [_La maniere de cette pecherie, voy au lieu sus-dit._] En\r\nquoy faisant il eut en rencontre vn navire Rochelois & vn autre du\r\nHavre de Grace, d'où il eut nouvelles de la mort lamentable de nôtre\r\ndefunct bon Roy, sans sçavoir par qui, ni comment. Mais apres eut en\r\nrencontre vn autre navire Anglois, d'où il entendit la méme chose,\r\naccusans du parricide des gens que ie ne veux ici nõmer: car ils le\r\ndisoient par haine & envie, n'ayans plus grans adversaires qu'eux.\r\n[_En_ 15. _jours du Banc en France._] En quinze jours donc ledit\r\nSieur de Sainct Iust fut rendu dudit Banc en France, ayant toujours\r\neu vent en poupe: navigation certes beaucoup plus agreable que celle\r\ndu vingtsixieme de Février mentionnée-ci-dessus. Les gens du Sieur de\r\nMonts partirent du Havre de Grace neuf ou dix jours apres ledit jour\r\n26. Février pour aller à Kebec, 40. lieuës pardela [39] la riviere de\r\nSaguenay, où icelui Sieur de Monts s'est fortifié. Mais ilz furent\r\ncontraints de relacher pour les mauvais vents. Et là dessus courut\r\nvn bruit que le Sieur de Poutrincourt estoit peri en mer, & tout son\r\nequipage. A quoy ie n'adjoutay onques foy, croyant pour certain que\r\nDieu l'aidera, & le fera passer par-dessus toutes difficultez. [_Kebec\r\nFort du Sieur de Monts._] Nous n'avons encore nouvelles dudit Kebec, &\r\nen attendons bien-tot. Mais ie puis dire pour la verité que si jamais\r\nquelque chose de bon reüssit de la Nouvelle-France la posterité en\r\naura de l'obligatiõ audit Sieur de Monts autheur de ces choses, auquel\r\nsi on n'eust point oté le privilege qui lui avoit esté baillé pour la\r\ntraite de Castors & autres pelleteries, aujourd'hui nous aurions force\r\nbestiaux, arbres fruictiers, peuples, & batim[~e]s en ladite province.\r\nCar il a desiré ardamment de voir pardela les affaires etablies à\r\nl'honneur de Dieu & de la France. Et jaçoit qu'on lui ait oté le sujet\r\nde continuer, si ne s'est il point decouragé jusques à present de\r\nfaire ce qu'il a peu, ayant fait batir vn Fort audit Kebec, avec des\r\nlogemens fort beaux & commodes. En ce lieu de Kebec cette [40] grande &\r\nimmense riviere de Canada est reduite à l'étroit, & n'a que la portée\r\nd'vn fauconneau de large, abõdante en poissons autant que riviere du\r\nmonde. Pour le pays il est beau à merveilles, & abondant en chasse.\r\nMais estant en pays plus froid que le port Royal, assavoir quatre\r\nvingtz lieuës plus au Nort, aussi la pelleterie y est elle beaucoup\r\nplus belle. Car (entre autres) les Renars y sont noirs, & d'vn poil si\r\nbeau, qu'il semble faire honte à la Martre. Les Sauvages du Port Royal\r\ny peuvent aller en dix ou douze jours par le moyen des rivieres sur\r\nlesquelles ils navigent préque jusques à la source, & de là portans\r\nleurs petits canots d'écorce par quelque espace dans les bois, ils\r\ngaignent vne autre riviere qui va tomber dans ledit fleuve de Canada,\r\n& ainsi expedient bien-tot de lõgs voyages: ce que de nous-mémes ne\r\nsçaurions faire en l'etat qu'est le païs. Et par mer audit Kebec il\r\ny a dudit Port Royal plus de quatre cens lieuës en allant par le Cap\r\nBreton. Ledit Sieur de Monts y auoit envoyé des vaches dés il y a deux\r\nans & demi, mais faute de quelque femme de village qui entendist le\r\n[41] gouvernement d'icelles, on en a laissé mourir la pluspart en se\r\ndechargeant de leurs veaux. [_Femmes combien necessaires._] En quoy\r\nse reconoit combien vne femme est necessaire en vne maison, laquelle\r\nie ne sçay pourquoy tant de gens rejettent, & ne s'en peuvent passer.\r\nQuant à moy ie seray toujours d'auis qu'en quelque habitation que ce\r\nsoit on ne fera jamais fruit sans la compagnie des femmes. Sans elles\r\nla vie est triste, les maladies viennent, & meurt on sans secours.\r\nC'est pourquoy ie me mocque de ces mysogames qui leur ont voulu tant\r\nde mal, & particulierement i'en veux à ce fol qu'on a mis au nombre\r\ndes sept Sages, lequel disoit que la femme est vn mal necessaire, veu\r\nqu'il n'y a bien au monde comparable à elle. [_Ecclesi._ 4 _vers._ 10.]\r\nAussi Dieu la il baillée _pour compagne à l'homme, afin de l aider\r\n& consoler_: & le Sage dit que _Malheureux est l'hõme qui est seul,\r\ncar il n'a personne qui l echauffe, & s'il tombe en la fosse il n'a\r\npersonne pour le relever_. Que s'il y a des femmes folles, il faut\r\nestimer que les hommes ne sont point sãs faute. De ce defaut de vaches\r\nplusieurs se sont ressentis, car estant tombés malades ilz n'ont pas\r\neu toutes les douceurs [42] qu'autrement ils eussent euës, & s'en sont\r\nallez promener aux champs Elisées. [_Conspiration chatiee._] Vn autre\r\nqui auoit esté de nôtre voyage, n'eut point la patience d'attendre\r\ncela, & voulut gaigner le ciel par escalade dés le commencement de\r\nson arrivée, par vne conspiration contre le sieur Champlein son\r\nCapitaine. Les complices furent condemnés aux galeres, & ramenés en\r\nFrance. [_Voyage aux Iroquois._] L'Eté venu assavoir il y a vn an,\r\nledit Champlein desireux de voir le païs des Iroquois, afin qu'en\r\nson absence les Sauvages ne se saisissent point de son Fort, il leur\r\npersuada d'aller là faire la guerre, & partirent avec lui & deux autres\r\nFrançois, en nõbre de quatre-vingts ou cent, iusques au lac desdits\r\nIroquois, à deux c[~e]s lieües loin dudit Kebec. [_Peuples ennemis._]\r\nDe tout temps il y a eu guerre entre ces deux nations, comme entre les\r\nSouriquois & Armouchiquois: & se sont quelquefois elevés les Iroquois\r\njusques au nõbre de huit mille hommes, pour guerroyer & exterminer\r\ntous ceux qui habitoient la grande riviere de Canada: comme il est\r\nà croire qu'ils ont fait, d'autant que là n'est plus aujourd'hui le\r\nlangage qui s'y parloit au [43] temps de Iacques Quartier, qui y fut\r\nil y a quatre-vingts ans. [_Guerre._] Ledit Champlein avec ses troupes\r\narrivé là, ilz ne se peurent si bien cacher qu'ilz ne fussent apperceuz\r\nde ces peuples, qui ont toujours des sentinelles sur les avenües de\r\nleurs ennemis: & s'estans les vns & les autres bien remparés, il fut\r\nconvenu entre eux de ne point combattre pour ce jour là, mais de\r\nremettre l'affaire au lendemain. Le temps lors estoit serein: si bien\r\nque l'Aurore n'eut point plutot chassé les ombres de la nuit, que la\r\nrumeur s'emeût par tout le camp. Quelque enfant perdu des Iroquois\r\nayant voulu sortir de ses rempars, fut transpercé non d'un trait\r\nd'Apollon, ou de l'Archerot aux yeux bendés, mais d'un vray trait\r\nmateriel & bien poignant qui le mit à la renverse. Là dessus, la colere\r\nmonte au front des offensés & chacun se met en ordre pour attaquer &\r\nse defendre. Comme la troupe des Iroquois s'avançoit, Champlein qui\r\navoit chargé son mousquet à deux balles, voyant deux Iroquois marcher\r\ndevant avec des panaches sur la tête, se douta que c'estoient deux\r\nCapitaines, & voulut s'avancer [44] pour les mirer. Mais les Sauvages\r\nde Kebec l'empecherent, disans: Il n'est pas bon qu'ilz te voyent,\r\ncar incontinent, n'ayans point accoutumé de voir telles gens, ilz\r\ns'en fuiront. Mais retire toy derriere le premier rang des nôtres, &\r\npuis quand nous serons prets, tu devanceras. Ce qu'il fit: & par ce\r\nmoyen furent les deux Capitaines tout ensemble emportés d'vn coup de\r\nmousquet. [_Victorie._] Lors victoire gaignée. Car chacun se debende,\r\n& ne restoit qu'à poursuivre. [_Tabagie, c'est fest[~i]._] Ce qui fut\r\nfait avec peu de resistance, & emporterent environ cinquante têtes de\r\nleurs ennemis, dont au retour ilz firent de merveilleuses fêtes en\r\nTabagies, danses, & chansons continuelles, selon leur coutume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] The Conversion of the Savages who have been baptized in New France\r\nduring this year, 1610.\r\n\r\n[_Matth. 24, verse 14._]\r\n\r\nTHE unchangeable word of our Savior Jesus Christ bears witness to us\r\nthrough the lips of saint Matthew that _This Gospel of the kingdom,\r\nshall be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to all nations,\r\nand then shall the consummation come_. History shows that the voice\r\nof the Apostles has resounded for several centuries past throughout\r\nall the old world, although to-day the Christian kingdoms form the\r\nsmallest part of it. But as to the new world, discovered some hundred\r\nand twenty years ago, we have no proof that the word of God has ever\r\n[8] been proclaimed there prior to these later times; unless we are to\r\nbelieve the story of Jean de Lery,[5] who says that one day as he was\r\ntelling the Brazilians about the great miracles of God in the creation\r\nof the world, and the mysteries of our redemption, an old man told\r\nhim that he had heard his grandfather say that, many years before, a\r\nbearded man (Brazilians have no beards) had come among them and had\r\nrelated something similar; but that they would not listen to him, and\r\nsince then had been killing and eating each other. As to the other\r\ncountries beyond the sea, some of them have indeed a certain vague\r\nknowledge of the deluge, and of the immortality of the soul, together\r\nwith the future reward of those who live aright; but they might have\r\nhanded this obscure doctrine down, from generation to generation, since\r\nthe universal deluge which happened in the time of Noah. It remains\r\nnow to deplore the wretched condition of these people who occupy a\r\ncountry so large that the old world bears no comparison with it, if we\r\ninclude the land which lies beyond the straits of Magellan, called [9]\r\n_Terra del fugo_, extending as far toward China and Japan as toward\r\nNew Guinea; and also the country beyond the great river of Canada,[6]\r\nwhich stretches out to the East and is washed by the great Western\r\nocean. Dense ignorance prevails in all these countries, where there is\r\nno evidence that they have ever felt the breath of the Gospel, except\r\nin this last century when the Spaniard carried thither some light of\r\nthe Christian religion, together with his cruelty and avarice.[7] But\r\nthis was so little that it should not receive much consideration, since\r\nby the very confession of those who have written their histories, they\r\nhave killed almost all the natives of the country, who, only seventy\r\nyears ago, according to a certain historian,[8] numbered more than\r\ntwenty millions. For more than twenty-five years, the English have\r\nretained a foothold in a country called, in honor of the deceased\r\nQueen of England, Virginia, which lies between Florida and the land\r\nof the Armouchiquois.[9] But that country carries on its affairs with\r\nso much secrecy, that very few persons know [10] anything definite\r\nabout it. Soon after I published my History of New France,[10] there\r\nwas an embarkation of eight hundred men to be sent there. It is not\r\nreported that they bathed their hands in the blood of those people, for\r\nwhich they are neither to be praised nor blamed: for there is no law\r\nnor pretext which permits us to kill anyone, whosoever he may be, and\r\nespecially the persons whose property we have seized. But they are\r\nto be commended if they show to these poor ignorant people the way of\r\nsalvation by the true and unvarnished doctrine of the Gospel. As to our\r\nFrench people, I have complained enough in my History of the cowardice\r\nof these later times, and of our lack of zeal either in reclaiming\r\nthese poor erring ones, or in making known, exalted, and glorified,\r\nthe name of God in the lands beyond the seas, where it never has been\r\nproclaimed. And yet we wish that country to bear the name of France,\r\na name so august and venerable that we cannot, without a feeling of\r\nshame, glory in an un-Christianized France. I know that there are any\r\nnumber of people who are willing to go there. But why is it that [11]\r\nthe Church, which has so much wealth; why is it that the Nobility, who\r\nexpend so much needlessly, do not establish some fund for the execution\r\nof so holy a work? Two courageous Gentlemen, Sieurs de Monts and de\r\nPoutrincourt, have in these later times shown such great zeal in this\r\nwork, that they have weakened their resources by their outlays, and\r\nhave done more than their strength justified them in doing. Both have\r\ncontinued their voyages up to the present time. But one of them has\r\nbeen frustrated twice, and has had heavy losses through too great\r\nconfidence in the words of certain persons. Now, inasmuch as the latest\r\nnews of our New France comes from Sieur de Poutrincourt, we shall speak\r\nhere of what he has accomplished, and we have good reason to praise his\r\ncourage; for (not being able to live among the crowd of idle men, of\r\nwhom we have only too many, and seeing our France seeming to languish\r\nin a monotonous calm that was wearisome to men of action), after having\r\ngiven a thousand proofs of his valor, during the last twenty-four\r\nyears, he sought to crown [12] his truly Herculean labors in the cause\r\nof God, for which he employs his means and strength, and endangers his\r\nlife, by increasing the number of celestial citizens, and leading to\r\nthe fold of Jesus Christ, our sovereign Shepherd, the wandering sheep,\r\nwhom it would be becoming to the Prelates of the Church to go out and\r\ngather in (at least to contribute to this end) since they have the\r\nmeans of doing so. But with what difficulty has he labored in this\r\ncause up to the present time? Thrice has he crossed the great Ocean\r\nto carry on his enterprises. The first year was passed with sieur de\r\nMonts in seeking a suitable dwelling and a safe port for the withdrawal\r\nof the ships and their crews. In this, they did not meet with much\r\nsuccess. The second year passed in the same way, and then he returned\r\nto France. During the third year, we experimented with the soil, which\r\nyielded abundantly to our cultivation. This present year, discovering\r\nthrough an unfortunate experience that men are not always to be\r\ntrusted, he made up his mind to depend upon no one but himself, and put\r\nto sea on the twenty-sixth of February; the [13] weather being very\r\nunfavorable, he made the longest voyage of which I have ever heard;\r\ncertainly our own, three years ago, was tedious enough, when we drifted\r\nabout upon the sea for the space of two months and a half before\r\nreaching Port Royal. But this one lasted three whole months, so that\r\none reckless man was about to mutiny, going so far as to form wicked\r\nconspiracies; but Sieur de Poutrincourt's kindness, and respect for the\r\nplace where he lived in Paris, served as a shield to protect his life.\r\n[_Terrir, meaning to discover the land._] The first coast which Sieur\r\nde Poutrincourt discovered was port Mouton; there, among the fogs\r\nwhich are very common in this sea during the Summer, he encountered\r\nserious dangers, principally in the neighborhood of Cape Sable,\r\nwhere his ship came near foundering. [_History of New France, book\r\n2, chap. 37, p. 527._] Thence, in trying to reach Port Royal, he was\r\ncarried by violent winds forty leagues beyond, namely to the Norombega\r\nriver,[11] so celebrated and so fabulously described by Geographers and\r\nHistorians, as I have shown in my said History, where this voyage may\r\nbe seen in the geographical Chart [14] which I have inserted therein.\r\nThence he came to the river saint John, which is opposite Port Royal\r\nbeyond French Bay,[12] where he found a ship from St. Malo trading with\r\nthe Savages of the country. Here complaint was made to him by a Captain\r\nof the Savages, that one of the crew of the said ship had stolen\r\naway his wife and was abusing her: the Sieur informed himself about\r\nthe matter and then made a prisoner of the malefactor and seized the\r\nship.[13] But he released the ship and the sailors, contenting himself\r\nby retaining the guilty one, who escaped, however, in a shallop, and\r\nwent off with the Savages, prejudicing them against the French, as we\r\nshall relate hereafter. Arrived at last at Port Royal, it is impossible\r\nto describe the joy with which these poor people received the Sieur and\r\nhis company. And, in truth, there was still greater reason for this\r\njoy, since they had lost all hope of ever again seeing the French live\r\namong them. They had had some experience of our kind treatment while we\r\nwere there, and, seeing themselves deprived of it, they wept bitterly\r\nwhen we left them three years ago.\r\n\r\nThis Port Royal, the home [15] of sieur de Poutrincourt, is the most\r\nbeautiful earthly habitation that God has ever made. It is fortified\r\nupon the North by a range of 12 or 15 leagues of mountains, upon\r\nwhich the Sun beats all day, and by hills on the Southern or Meridian\r\nshore, which forms a port that can securely harbor twenty thousand\r\nships, being twenty fathoms deep at its entrance, a league and a half\r\nin width, and four leagues long, extending to an island which is a\r\nFrench league in circumference: here I have sometimes seen swimming\r\nat ease a medium-sized Whale, which came in with the tide at eight\r\no'clock every morning. Furthermore, there can be caught in this\r\nport, in their season, great quantities of herring, smelt, sardines,\r\nbarbels, codfish, seals and other fish; and as to shell-fish, there\r\nis an abundance of lobsters, crabs, palourdes,[14] cockles, mussels,\r\nsnails, and porpoises. But whoever is disposed to go beyond the tides\r\nof the sea will find in the river quantities of sturgeon and salmon,\r\nand will have plenty of sport in landing them. Now, to return to our\r\nstory; When Sieur de Poutrincourt arrived [6 i.e. 16] there, he found\r\nhis buildings entire, the Savages (as these people have been called up\r\nto the present) not having touched them in any way, even the furniture\r\nremaining as we had left it. Anxious about their old friends, they\r\nasked how they were all getting along, calling each individual by his\r\nname, and asking why such and such a one had not come back. This shows\r\nthe great amiability of these people, who, having seen in us only the\r\nmost humane qualities, never flee from us, as they do from the Spaniard\r\nin this whole new world. And consequently by a certain gentleness and\r\ncourtesy, which are as well known to them as to us, it is easy to make\r\nthem pliant to all our wishes, and especially so in regard to Religion,\r\nof which we left them some good impressions when we were there; and\r\nthey seemed to wish for nothing better than to enroll themselves under\r\nthe banner of Jesus Christ, where they would have been received at\r\nonce if we had had a firm foothold in the country. But just as we were\r\nhoping to continue [17] the work, it happened that sieur de Monts,\r\nbeing unable longer to meet the expenses, and not receiving any help\r\nfrom the King, was obliged to recall all those who were over there, who\r\nhad not taken with them the means necessary to a longer sojourn. So it\r\nwould have been rash and unwise to administer baptism to people whom\r\nit was necessary afterwards to abandon, and give them an opportunity\r\nto return to their corruption. But now that the work is being carried\r\non in earnest, and as sieur de Poutrincourt has actually settled\r\nthere, it is lawful to impress upon their minds and souls the stamp of\r\nChristianity, after having instructed them in the principal articles of\r\nour Faith. [_Hebrews 11, vers. 6._] Sieur de Poutrincourt is careful\r\nto do this, remembering what the Apostle said, _He that cometh to God,\r\nmust believe that he is_; and after believing this, one comes gradually\r\nto ideas which are farther removed from mere sensual apprehension, such\r\nas the belief that out of nothing God created all things, that he made\r\nhimself man, that he was born of a Virgin, that he consented to die for\r\nman, etc. And inasmuch as the Ecclesiastics who have been taken over\r\nthere, are not [18] familiar with the language of these people, the\r\nSieur has taken the trouble to teach them and to have them taught by\r\nhis eldest son, a young Gentleman who understands and speaks the native\r\nlanguage very well, and who seems to have been destined to open up to\r\nthe Savages the way to heaven. The people who are at Port Royal, and\r\nin the adjacent countries extending toward Newfoundland, are called\r\nSouriquois[15] and have a language of their own. But beyond French Bay,\r\nwhich extends into the land about forty leagues, and is ten or twelve\r\nleagues wide, the people on the other side are called Etechemins; and\r\nstill farther away are the Armouchiquois, whose language is different\r\nfrom that of the Etechemins, and who are fortunate in having an\r\nabundance of vines and large grapes, if they only knew how to make use\r\nof this fruit, which they believe (as did our ancient Gauls) to be\r\npoisonous. [_Ammianus Marcellinus._] They also have excellent hemp,\r\nwhich grows wild, and in quality and appearance is much superior to\r\nours. Besides this they have Sassafras, and a great abundance of oak,\r\nwalnut, plum and chestnut trees, and other fruits which are unknown to\r\nus. As to Port Royal, I must confess that there is not [19] much fruit\r\nthere; and yet the land is productive enough to make us hope from it\r\nall that Gallic France yields to us. All these tribes are governed by\r\nCaptains called Sagamores, a word used with the same signification in\r\nthe East Indies, as I have read in the History by Maffeus,[16] and\r\nwhich I believe comes from the Hebrew word _Sagan_, which, according\r\nto Rabbi David, means Great Prince, and sometimes means the one who\r\nholds the second place after the sovereign Pontiff. [_Isaiah 41, vers.\r\n25, Jerem. 51, vers. 23, Santes Pagnin, 9._] In the usual version of\r\nthe Bible it is defined \"Magistrate,\" and yet even there the Hebrew\r\ninterpreters translate it by the word \"Prince.\" And in fact we read\r\nin Berosus[17] that Noah was called Saga, as much because he was a\r\ngreat Prince as because he had taught Theology and the ceremonies\r\nof divine service, and also many of the secrets of nature, to the\r\nArmenian Scythians, whom the ancient Cosmographers called \"Sages,\"\r\nafter Noah. And perhaps for this very same reason our Tectosages,\r\nwho are the Tolosains,[18] are so called. For this good father, who\r\nrestored the world, came into Italy and sent [20] a new population\r\ninto Gaul after the Deluge, giving his name, Gauls (for Xenophon says\r\nthat he was also called by this name), to those whom he sent there,\r\nbecause he had escaped from the waters. And it is not improbable that\r\nhe himself imposed this name upon the Tectosages. Let us return to\r\nour word Sagamore, which is the title of honor given to the Captains\r\nin these new Lands, of which we are speaking. At Port Royal, the name\r\nof the Captain or Sagamore of the place is Membertou.[19] He is at\r\nleast a hundred years old, and may in the course of nature live more\r\nthan fifty years longer. He has under him a number of families whom he\r\nrules, not with so much authority as does our King over his subjects,\r\nbut with sufficient power to harangue, advise, and lead them to war,\r\nto render justice to one who has a grievance, and like matters. He\r\ndoes not impose taxes upon the people, but if there are any profits\r\nfrom the chase he has a share of them, without being obliged to take\r\npart in it. It is true that they sometimes make him presents of Beaver\r\nskins and other things, when he is occupied in curing the sick; or in\r\nquestioning [21] his demon (whom he calls _Aoutem_) to have news of\r\nsome future event or of the absent: for, as each village, or company\r\nof Savages, has an _Aoutmoin_, or Prophet, who performs this office,\r\nMembertou is the one who, from time immemorial, has practiced this art\r\namong his followers. He has done it so well that his reputation is\r\nfar above that of all the other Sagamores of the country, he having\r\nbeen since his youth a great Captain, and also having exercised the\r\noffices of Soothsayer and Medicine-man, which are the three things\r\nmost efficacious to the well-being of man, and necessary to this human\r\nlife. Now this Membertou to-day, by the grace of God, is a Christian,\r\ntogether with all his family, having been baptized, and twenty others\r\nwith him, on last saint John's day, the 24th of June. I have letters\r\nfrom Sieur de Poutrincourt about it, dated the eleventh day of July\r\nfollowing. He said Membertou was named after our late good King HENRI\r\nIV., and his eldest son after Monseigneur the Dauphin, to-day our King\r\nLOUIS XIII., whom may God bless. And so, as a natural consequence, the\r\nwife of Membertou [22] was named MARIE after the Queen Regent, and her\r\ndaughter received the name of the Queen, MARGUERITE. The second son of\r\nMembertou, called Actaudin, was named PAUL after our holy Father, the\r\nPope of Rome. The daughter of the aforesaid Louis was named CHRISTINE\r\nin honor of Madame, the eldest sister of the King. And thus to each\r\none was given the name of some illustrious or notable personage here\r\nin France. A number of other Savages were about to camp elsewhere (as\r\nit is their custom to scatter in bands when summer comes) at the time\r\nof these ceremonies of Christian regeneration, whom we believe to be\r\nto-day enrolled in the family of God by the same cleansing water of\r\nholy baptism.[20] But the devil, who never sleeps, has shown the\r\njealousy which he felt at the salvation of these people, and at seeing\r\nthat the name of God was glorified in this land, by inciting a wicked\r\nFrenchman, not a Frenchman but a Turk, not a Turk but an Atheist, to\r\ndivert from the path of righteousness several Savages who had been\r\nChristians in their hearts and [23] souls for three years; and among\r\nothers a Sagamore named Chkoudun, a man of great influence, of whom\r\nI have made honorable mention in my History of New France, because I\r\nsaw that he, more than all the others, loved the French, and that he\r\nadmired our civilization more than their ignorance: to such an extent,\r\nthat being present sometimes at the Christian admonitions, which were\r\ngiven every Sunday to our French people, he listened attentively,\r\nalthough he did not understand a word; and moreover wore the sign of\r\nthe Cross upon his bosom, which he also had his servants wear; and he\r\nhad in imitation of us, a great Cross erected in the public place of\r\nhis village, called _Oigoudi_, at the port of the river saint John,\r\nten leagues from Port Royal. Now this man, with others, was turned\r\naway from Christianity, by the cursed avarice of this wicked Frenchman\r\nto whom I have referred above, and whom I do not wish to name now on\r\naccount of the love and reverence I bear his father, but I protest that\r\nI will immortalize him if he does not mend his ways. He, I say, in\r\norder to defraud this Sagamore [24], Chkoudun, of a few Beavers, went\r\nlast June to bribe him, after having escaped from the hands of Sieur de\r\nPoutrincourt, saying that all this Poutrincourt told them about God was\r\nnonsense, that they need not believe it, that he was an impostor, that\r\nhe would kill them and get their Beavers. I omit a great many wicked\r\nstories that he may have added to this. If he were of the religious\r\nbelief of those who call themselves Reformed, I might somewhat excuse\r\nhim. But he plainly shows that he is neither of the one nor the\r\nother. But I will say, however, that he has reason to thank God for\r\nhis escape from imminent peril on our voyage. This Sagamore, being\r\na Christian, by his good example might have caused a great number of\r\nothers to become Christians. But I am willing to hope, or rather firmly\r\nbelieve, that he will not remain much longer in this error, and that\r\nthe Sieur will have found some means of attracting him with many others\r\nto himself, to impress upon him the vital truths with which he had\r\nformerly, in my presence, touched his soul. For the spirit of God has\r\npower to drop upon this field fresh dew, which will bring forth a new\r\ngermination where all has been laid waste and beaten down by the hail.\r\nMay God, by his grace, guide all in such a way that it will redound\r\nto his glory and to the edification of this people, for whom all\r\nChristians ought to make continual supplication to his divine goodness,\r\nto the end that he may consent to confirm and advance the work, which\r\nhe has been pleased to begin at this time for the exaltation of his\r\nname and for the salvation of his creatures.[21]\r\n\r\nEND.\r\n\r\n[25] There are in that country some men of the Church, of good\r\nscholarship, whom nothing but their religious zeal has taken there,\r\nand who will not fail to do all that piety requires in this respect.\r\nNow, for the present, there is no need of any learned Doctors who may\r\nbe more useful in combating vices and heresies at home. Besides, there\r\nis a certain class of men in whom we cannot have complete confidence,\r\nwho are in the habit of censuring everything that is not in harmony\r\nwith their maxims, and wish to rule wherever they are. It is enough to\r\nbe watched from abroad without having these fault-finders, from whom\r\neven the greatest Kings cannot defend themselves, come near enough to\r\nrecord every movement of our hearts and souls. And then what would be\r\nthe use of so many such men over there at present, unless they wanted\r\nto devote themselves to the cultivation of the soil? For going there\r\nis not all. What they will do, when they get there, must be taken into\r\nconsideration. As to Sieur de Poutrincourt's residence, he provided\r\nhimself at his departure with everything that was necessary. But if\r\na few honest people were seized with a desire to [26] advance the\r\ncause of the Gospel there, I would advise them to make up five or six\r\nparties, each one having a well-equipped ship, and to go and establish\r\ncolonies in different parts of New France, as at Tadoussac, Gachepé,\r\nCampseau, la Héve, Oigoudi, Ste. Croix, Pemptegoet, Kinibeki, and in\r\nother places, where there are assemblages of Savages, whom time must\r\nlead to the Christian Religion: unless the head of some great family,\r\nlike the King, wishes to have the sole glory of peopling these lands.\r\nFor to think of living as the Savages do seems to me out of all reason.\r\nAnd to prove this, the following is an example of their way of living:\r\n[_Manner of living of the Souriquois and Ethechemins._] From the first\r\nland (which is Newfoundland) to the country of the Armouchiquois,\r\na distance of nearly three hundred leagues, the people are nomads,\r\nwithout agriculture, never stopping longer than five or six weeks in\r\na place. Pliny mentions a certain people called Ichthyophagi, i.e.,\r\nFish-eaters, living in the same way. These Savages get their living in\r\nthis manner during three seasons of the year. For, when Spring comes,\r\nthey divide into bands upon the shores of the sea, until [27] Winter;\r\nand then as the fish withdraw to the bottom of the great salt waters,\r\nthey seek the lakes and the shades of the forests, where they catch\r\nBeavers, upon which they live, and other game, as Elk, Caribou, Deer,\r\nand still smaller animals. And yet, sometimes even in Summer, they do\r\nnot give up hunting: besides, there are an infinite number of birds on\r\ncertain islands in the months of May, June, July and August. [_Their\r\nbeds._] As to their beds, a skin spread out upon the ground serves as\r\nmattress. And in this we have nothing to jest about, for our old Gallic\r\nancestors did the same thing, and even dined from the skins of dogs\r\nand wolves, if Diodorus and Strabo tell the truth. [_Armouchiquois._]\r\nBut as to the Armouchiquois and Iroquois countries, there is a greater\r\nharvest to be gathered there by those who are inspired by religious\r\nzeal, because they are not so sparsely populated, and the people\r\ncultivate the soil, from which they derive some of the comforts of\r\nlife. It is true that they do not understand very well how to make\r\nbread, not having mills, yeast, or ovens; so they pound their corn in\r\na kind of [28] mortar, and make a paste of it as best they can, and\r\nbake it between two stones heated at the fire; or they roast this corn\r\non the ear upon the live coals, as did the old Romans, according to\r\nPliny. [_Pliny, book 18, chap. 2 and 10._] Afterwards people learned\r\nto bake cakes under the embers; and still later bakers began to make\r\nuse of ovens. Now these people who cultivate the soil are stationary,\r\nnot like the others who have nothing of their own, just as the Germans\r\nin the time of Tacitus, who has described their ancient way of living.\r\n[_Iroquois._] Farther inland, and beyond the Armouchiquois, are the\r\nIroquois tribes, also stationary, because they till the soil, whence\r\nthey gather maize wheat (or Buckwheat), beans, edible roots, and in\r\nshort all that we have mentioned in describing the Armouchiquois, even\r\nmore, for from necessity they draw their sustenance from the earth,\r\nas they are far from the sea. However, they have a great lake in their\r\ncountry, of wonderful extent, perhaps about sixty leagues, around which\r\nthey encamp. [_New Mexico._] In this lake there are large and beautiful\r\nislands inhabited by the Iroquois, who are a great people; the farther\r\n[29] we penetrate into the country, the more we find it inhabited: so\r\nmuch so that (if we can believe the Spaniards) in the country called\r\nNew Mexico, a long distance to the Southwest of these Iroquois, there\r\nare regularly built cities and houses of three and four stories, and\r\neven domesticated cattle, whence they have named a certain river, _Rio\r\nde las Vaccas_, or Cow river, because they saw a large number of them\r\ngrazing on its banks. [_A great lake beyond Canada._] And this country\r\nis more than five hundred leagues directly to the north of old Mexico,\r\nbeing near, I believe, the end of the great lake of the river of Canada\r\nwhich (according to the Savages) is a thirty days' journey in length.\r\nI believe that robust and hardy men could live among these people, and\r\ndo great work for the advancement of the Christian Religion. But as to\r\nthe Souriquois and Etechemins, who are nomadic and divided, they must\r\nbe made sedentary by the cultivation of the land, thus obliging them to\r\nremain in one place. For any one who has taken the trouble to cultivate\r\na piece of land does not readily abandon it, but struggles valiantly\r\nto keep it. [30] But, I think, the execution of this plan will be very\r\nslow unless we take hold of it with more zeal, and unless a King, or\r\nsome rich Prince, take this cause in hand, which is certainly worthy\r\na most Christian kingdom. [_Conquest of Palestine compared with that\r\nof New France._] Great expense and loss of life were once incurred\r\nin the re-conquest of Palestine, from which there was little profit;\r\nand to-day at slight expense wonders could be accomplished, and an\r\ninfinite number of people won over to God, without striking a blow:\r\nand yet we are touched by an inexplicable apathy in religious matters,\r\nwhich is quite different from the fervid zeal, which of old burned in\r\nthe bosoms of our fathers. If we did not expect any temporal fruit\r\nfrom these labors, I would pardon this human weakness. But there are\r\nsuch well-founded hopes of good usury, that they close the mouths of\r\nall the enemies of that country, who decry it in order not to lose the\r\ntraffic in Beaver and other furs from which they gain a livelihood, and\r\nwithout which they would die of starvation or would not know what to\r\ndo. [_Appeal to the King and the Queen Regent._] But if the King and\r\nthe Queen Regent, his mother, in whom God has kindled a fire of piety,\r\nshould be pleased to take an interest in this (as she has certainly\r\ndone in the report of the Conversion of the Savages, baptized through\r\nthe [31] instrumentality of Sieur de Poutrincourt) and would leave some\r\nmemorial of herself, or rather would secure for herself the blessedness\r\nof heaven by this most godly act, no one can tell how great would be\r\nher future glory in being the first to establish the Gospel in such\r\nvast territories, which (so to speak) have no bounds. If Helena, the\r\nmother of the Emperor Constantine, had found such a field for good\r\nwork, she would have greatly preferred to glorify God with living\r\ntemples, instead of building so many marble edifices, with which she\r\nhas filled the holy land. And, after all, the hope of temporal profit\r\nis not vain. For on one hand Sieur de Poutrincourt will continue to be\r\nthe servant of the King in the country which his Majesty has granted\r\nhim; where he would afford a rendezvous and give assistance to all the\r\nvessels which go every year to the new World, where they encounter\r\na thousand hardships and, as we have seen and heard, great numbers of\r\nthem are lost. [_Means of reaching the Moluccas through the Northern\r\nroute._] On the other hand, penetrating into the country, we might\r\nbecome familiar with the route to China and the Moluccas, through\r\na mild climate and latitude, establishing a few stations, or [32]\r\nsettlements, at the Falls of the great Canadian river, then at the\r\nlakes which are beyond, the last of which is not far from the great\r\nWestern sea, through which the Spaniards to-day reach the Orient. Or,\r\nindeed, the same enterprise could be carried on through the Saguenay\r\nriver, beyond which the Savages say there is a sea of which they have\r\nnever seen the end, which is without doubt that Northern passage that\r\nhas been so long sought in vain. [_Advantages._] So that we could have\r\nspices and other drugs without begging them from the Spaniards, and\r\nthe profits derived from us upon these commodities would remain in\r\nthe hands of the King, not counting the advantages of having hides,\r\npasturage, fisheries, and other sources of wealth. But we must sow\r\nbefore we can reap. In this work we could give employment to many of\r\nthe youth of France, a part of whom languish in poverty or in idleness:\r\nwhile others go to foreign countries to teach the trades which in\r\nformer times belonged strictly and peculiarly to us, and by means of\r\nwhich France was filled with prosperity; whereas, to-day, a long period\r\nof peace has not yet been able to restore to her her former glory, as\r\nmuch [33] for the reasons just given, as for the number of idle men,\r\nand of able-bodied and voluntary mendicants, whom the public supports.\r\n[_Chicanery._] Among these obstacles we may place also the evil of\r\nchicanery, which preys upon our nation, and which has always been a\r\nreproach to it. [_Ammianus Marcellinus._] This would be somewhat\r\nobviated by frequent voyages; for a part of these pettifoggers would\r\nsooner conquer some new land, remaining under the dominion of the King,\r\nthan follow up their cause here with so much loss, delay, anxiety, and\r\nlabor. [_Happiness of the Savages._] And, in this respect, I consider\r\nall these poor savages, whom we commiserate, to be very happy; for pale\r\nEnvy doth not emaciate them, neither do they feel the inhumanity of\r\nthose who serve God hypocritically, harassing their fellow-creatures\r\nunder this mask; nor are they subject to the artifices of those who,\r\nlacking virtue and goodness wrap themselves up in a mantle of false\r\npiety to nourish their ambition. If they do not know God, at least they\r\ndo not blaspheme him, as the greater number of Christians do. Nor do\r\nthey understand the art of poisoning, or of corrupting [34] chastity by\r\ndevilish artifice. There are no poor nor beggars among them. All are\r\nrich, because all labor and live. But among us it is very different,\r\nfor more than half of us live from the labors of the others, having\r\nno trades which serve to the support of human life. [_Opportunities\r\nfor emigrants to New France._] If that country were settled, there are\r\nmen who would do there what they have not courage to do here. Here\r\nthey would not dare to be wood-cutters, husbandmen, vinedressers,\r\netc., because their fathers were pettifoggers, barber-surgeons, and\r\napothecaries. But over yonder they would forget their fear of being\r\nridiculed, and would take pleasure in cultivating their land, having a\r\ngreat many companions of as good families as theirs. Cultivating the\r\nsoil is the most innocent of occupations and the most sure; it was\r\nthe occupation of those from whom we have all descended, and of those\r\nbrave Roman Captains who knew how to subjugate, but not how to be\r\nsubjugated. But now, since pomp and malice have been introduced among\r\nmen, what was virtue has been turned into reproach, and idlers have\r\nrisen into favor. [_To the Queen._] However, let us leave these people,\r\nand return to Sieur de Poutrincourt, or rather to you, O most Christian\r\nQueen, [35] the greatest and most cherished of heaven, whom the eye of\r\nthe world looks down upon in its daily round about this universe. You\r\nwho have the control of the most noble Empire here below, how can you\r\nsee a Gentleman so full of good will, without employing and helping\r\nhim? Will you let him carry off the greatest honor in the world when\r\nit might have been yours, and will you let the triumph of this affair\r\nremain with him and not share in it yourself? No, no, Madame, all must\r\nproceed from you, and as the stars borrow their light from the sun, so\r\nupon the King, and upon you who have given him to us, all the great\r\ndeeds of the French depend. We must then anticipate this glory, and not\r\nyield it to another, while you have a Poutrincourt, a loyal Frenchman\r\nwho served the late lamented King, your Husband (may God give him\r\nabsolution), in affairs of State which are not recorded in history. In\r\nrevenge for which his house and property passed through the ordeal of\r\nfire. He is not crossing the Ocean to see the country, as have nearly\r\nall the others who have undertaken similar voyages [36] at the expense\r\nof our Kings. But he shows so plainly what his intentions are, that we\r\ncannot doubt them, and your Majesty will risk nothing by employing him\r\nin earnest for the propagation of the Christian religion in the Western\r\nlands beyond the sea. You recognize his zeal, your own is incomparable;\r\nbut you must take thought as to how you may best employ it. I commend\r\nthe Princesses and Ladies who for fifteen years have given of their\r\nmeans for the repose of those men or women who wished to sequester\r\nthemselves from the world. But I believe (under correction) that their\r\npiety would shine with greater luster if it were shown in behalf of\r\nthese poor Western nations, who are in a lamentable condition, and\r\nwhose lack of instruction cries to God for vengeance against those\r\nwho might help them to become Christians, and will not. A Queen of\r\nCastille caused the Christian religion to be introduced into the lands\r\nof the West which belong to Spain; so act, O light of the Queens of the\r\nworld, that through your instrumentality, the name of God may soon be\r\nproclaimed throughout all this new world; where it is not yet known.\r\nNow resuming the thread of our [37] History, as we have spoken of the\r\nvoyage of Sieur de Poutrincourt, it will not be out of place, if, after\r\nhaving touched upon the hardships and tediousness of his journey,\r\nwhich retarded him one year, we say a word about the return of his\r\nship, which will be brief, inasmuch as the voyages from the Western\r\nworld, this side of the Tropic of Cancer, are usually so. [_Book 1,\r\nch. 24, and book 2, ch. 41 and 42._] I have given the reason for this\r\nin my History of New France, to which I refer the Reader, where he\r\nwill also learn why it is that in Summer the sea there is overhung\r\nwith fogs to such an extent that for one clear day there are two foggy\r\nones; and twice we were in fogs which lasted eight entire days. [_For\r\nthese Banks, see the said History, book 2, ch. 24._] This is why Sieur\r\nde Poutrincourt's son, when he was sent back to France for fresh\r\nsupplies, was as long in reaching the great Codfish Banks from Port\r\nRoyal, as in getting to France from the said Banks; and yet from these\r\nBanks to the coast of France there are eight hundred good leagues;\r\nand thence to Port Royal there are hardly [38] more than three\r\nhundred. It is upon these Banks that a great many ships are usually\r\nfound all the Summer, fishing for Cod, which are brought to France\r\nand are called Newfoundland Codfish. [_For their manner of fishing,\r\nsee the above-mentioned place._] So Sieur de Poutrincourt's son (who\r\nis called Baron de Sainct Just), on arriving at these Banks, laid in\r\na supply of fresh meat and fish. While doing this he met a ship from\r\nRochelle and another from Havre de Grace, whence he heard the news of\r\nthe lamentable death of our late good King, without knowing by whom or\r\nhow he was killed. But afterwards he met an English ship from which he\r\nheard the same thing, certain persons being accused of this parricide\r\nwhom I will not here name; for they brought this accusation through\r\nhatred and envy, being great enemies of those whom they accused. [_In\r\n15 days from the Banks to France._] So in fifteen days Baron de Sainct\r\nJust made the distance between the Banks and France, always sailing\r\nbefore the wind; a voyage certainly much more agreeable than that of\r\nthe twenty-sixth day of February mentioned above. Sieur de Monts's\r\ncrew left Havre de Grace nine or ten days after this twenty-sixth\r\nof February to go to Kebec, forty leagues beyond [39] the Saguenay\r\nriver, where Sieur de Monts has fortified himself. But contrary winds\r\ncompelled them to put into port. And thereupon a report was circulated\r\nthat Sieur de Poutrincourt was lost in the sea with all his crew. I\r\ndid not believe this for an instant, trusting that God would help him\r\nand would enable him to surmount all difficulties. [_Kebec, Sieur de\r\nMonts's fort._] We have as yet no news from Kebec, but expect to hear\r\nfrom there soon. I can say truly that if ever any good comes out of New\r\nFrance, posterity will be indebted for it to Sieur de Monts, author of\r\nthese enterprises: and if they had not taken away the license which\r\nwas granted him to trade in Beaver and other skins, to-day we should\r\nhave had a vast number of cattle, fruit-trees, people, and buildings\r\nin the said province. For he earnestly desired to see everything\r\nestablished there to the honor of God and of France. And, although he\r\nhas been deprived of the motive for continuing, yet up to the present\r\nhe does not seem discouraged in doing what he can; for he has had built\r\nat Kebec a Fort and some very good and convenient dwellings. Here at\r\nKebec this [40] great and mighty river of Canada narrows down and is\r\nonly a falcon-shot wide; it has as great a supply of fish as any river\r\nin the world. As to the country, it is wonderfully beautiful, and\r\nabounds in game. But being in a colder region than port Royal, since it\r\nis eighty leagues farther North, the fur there is all the finer. For\r\n(among other animals) the Foxes are black and of such beautiful fur\r\nthat they seem to put the Martens to shame. The Savages of Port Royal\r\ncan go to Kebec in ten or twelve days by means of the rivers, which\r\nthey navigate almost up to their sources; and thence, carrying their\r\nlittle bark canoes for some distance through the woods, they reach\r\nanother stream which flows into the river of Canada, and thus greatly\r\nexpedite their long voyages, which we ourselves could not do in the\r\npresent state of the country. And from Port Royal to Kebec by sea it\r\nis more than four hundred leagues, going by way of Cape Breton. Sieur\r\nde Monts sent some cows there two years and a half ago, but for want\r\nof some village housewife who understood [41] taking care of them,\r\nthey let the greater part die in giving birth to their calves. [_The\r\nneed of women._] Which shows how necessary a woman is in a house,\r\nand I cannot understand why so many people slight them, although they\r\ncannot do without them. For my part, I shall always believe that, in\r\nany settlement whatsoever, nothing will be accomplished without the\r\npresence of women. Without them life is sad, sickness comes, and we die\r\nuncared-for. Therefore I despise those woman-haters who have wished\r\nthem all sorts of evil, which I hope will overtake that lunatic in\r\nparticular, who has been placed among the number of the seven Sages,\r\nwho said that woman is a necessary evil, since there is no blessing\r\nin the world to be compared to her. [_Ecclesiastes 4, verse 10._]\r\nTherefore God gave her _as a companion to man, to aid and comfort him_:\r\nand the Wise Man says:--_Woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth,\r\nhe hath none to lift him up. And if two lie together, they shall warm\r\none another_. If there are some worthless women, we must remember that\r\nmen are not faultless. Several suffered because of this lack of cows,\r\nfor, when they fell ill they did not have all the comforts [42] that\r\nthey would have had otherwise, and so they have departed to the Elysian\r\nfields. [_A conspiracy punished._] Another, who had been with us on the\r\nvoyage, did not have the patience to wait for death, but must needs\r\ngo to heaven by scaling the walls, as soon as he arrived there, by a\r\nconspiracy against sieur de Champlein, his Captain. His accomplices\r\nwere condemned to the galleys and sent back to France. [_Journey to the\r\nland of the Iroquois._] When Summer came, that is a year ago, Champlein\r\nwishing to see the country of the Iroquois, to prevent the Savages\r\nfrom seizing his Fort in his absence, persuaded them to go and make\r\nwar against them; so they departed with him and two other Frenchmen,\r\nto the number of eighty or a hundred, to the lake of the Iroquois,\r\ntwo hundred leagues distant from Kebec. [_Hostile nations._] There has\r\nalways been war between these two nations, as there has been between\r\nthe Souriquois and Armouchiquois: and sometimes the Iroquois have\r\nraised as many as eight thousand men to war against and exterminate all\r\nthose who live near the great river of Canada: and it seems that they\r\ndid this, as to-day the language which was spoken in the [43] time of\r\nJacques Quartier, who was there eighty years ago, is no longer heard\r\nin that region.[22] [_War._] When Champlein arrived there with his\r\ntroops, they could not conceal themselves so well but that they were\r\nperceived by the Iroquois, who always have sentinels upon the routes\r\nof their enemies: and each side being well fortified, it was agreed\r\namong them not to fight that day, but to postpone the affair until\r\nthe morrow. The weather then was very clear; so clear that scarcely\r\nhad Aurora chased away the shadows of the night, than a din was heard\r\nthroughout the camp. An Iroquois skirmisher having tried to issue from\r\nthe fortifications, was pierced through, not by one of the arrows of\r\nApollo, nor of the little Archer with the blindfolded eyes, but by a\r\ngenuine and very painful arrow, which stretched him out upon his back.\r\nThereupon the eyes of the offended were full of ire, and each one takes\r\nhis place in the line of attack and defense. As the band of Iroquois\r\nadvances, Champlein, who had charged his musket with two balls, seeing\r\ntwo Iroquois, their heads adorned with feathers, marching on in front,\r\nsupposed they were two Captains, and wanted to advance [44] and aim at\r\nthem. But the Kebec Savages prevented him, saying:--\"It is not well\r\nthat they should see thee, for, never having been accustomed to see\r\nsuch people as thou art, they would immediately run away. But withdraw\r\nbehind our first rank, and when we are ready, thou shalt advance.\" He\r\ndid so, and in this way the two Captains were both slain by one musket\r\nshot. [_Victory._] Victory ensued at once. For they all disbanded, and\r\nit only remained to pursue them. [_Tabagie is celebrated._] This was\r\ndone with little opposition, and they carried off some fifty of their\r\nenemies' heads, a triumph which, upon their return, they celebrated\r\nwith great festivities, consisting of continual Tabagies,[23] dances,\r\nand chants, according to their custom.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[45] Extrait dv Regitre de Bapteme de l'Eglise dv Port Royal en la\r\nNouvelle France.

The Grand Sagamore, whom we call in our\r\nlanguage Grand Captain of the Savages, and chief of all, was baptized\r\non last saint John the Baptist's day; [4] with his wife, children, and\r\nchildren's children, to the number of twenty; with as much enthusiasm,\r\nfervor, and zeal for Religion as would have been evinced by a person\r\nwho had been instructed in it for three or four years. He promises to\r\nhave the others baptized, or else make war upon them. [_The news of the\r\nKing's death had not then reached Canada._] Monsieur de Poutrincourt\r\nand his son acted as sponsors for them in the name of the King, and\r\nof Monseigneur the Dauphin. We have already made this good beginning,\r\nwhich I believe will become still better hereafter. As to the country,\r\nI have never seen anything so beautiful, better, or more fertile;\r\nand I can say to you, truly and honestly, that if I had three or\r\nfour Laborers with me now, and [5] the means of supporting them for\r\none year, and some wheat to sow in the ground tilled by their labor\r\nalone, I should expect to have a yearly trade in Beaver and other\r\nSkins amounting to seven or eight thousand livres, with the surplus\r\nwhich would remain to me after their support. I am very sorry that I\r\ndid not know before my departure what I know now; if I had, I should\r\nhave left no stone unturned to bring with me two or three farmers,\r\nand two hogsheads of wheat, which is a mere trifle. I assure you it\r\nis delightful to engage in trade over here and to make such handsome\r\nprofits. If you wish to take a hand in it, let me know your intentions\r\nby the bearer, who desires to return and traffic here in pursuance of\r\nwhat he has seen. I [6] shall say no more, except to pray God to give\r\nyou, Sir and Brother, a long life and perfect health.

Je vous donnerai seulement un précis des événements.\r\n\r\nQuand les marchands hérétiques nous virent à Dieppe, au jour fixé pour\r\nle départ, le 27 octobre de l'année dernière, 1610 (nous étions en\r\neffet convenus qu'on partirait de Dieppe), ils imaginèrent un moyen\r\nqu'ils crurent favorable pour nous nuire. Deux d'entre eux avaient fait\r\nun contrat avec M. de Potrincourt pour charger et équiper son navire,\r\n[5] sur lequel nous devions voyager. Ils déclarèrent aussitôt qu'ils ne\r\nvoulaient plus s'occuper du vaisseau, s'il devait porter des Jésuites.\r\nC'était une insigne malice, et elle était facile à prouver, surtout\r\nquand les catholiques leur ajoutaient que le devoir ne leur permettait\r\npas de refuser les Jésuites, puisque c'était l'ordre formel de la Reine.\r\n\r\nOn ne put cependant rien gagner sur eux. Il fallut avoir encore recours\r\nà la Reine. Sa Majesté écrit au gouverneur de la ville, catholique\r\nplein de zèle et de piété, et lui enjoint de signifier aux hérétiques\r\nque c'est sa volonté que les Jésuites soient reçus dans le vaisseau qui\r\nva partir pour la Nouvelle-France, et qu'on n'y mette aucun obstacle.\r\n\r\nA la réception de ces lettres, le gouverneur assemble ce qu'on\r\nappelle le consistoire, c'est-à-dire tous les fidèles disciples de\r\nCalvin. Il donne lecture des lettres de la Reine, et les invite à\r\nl'obéissance.--Quelques-uns, c'est-à-dire ceux qui étaient bons, disent\r\nhautement qu'ils sont eux aussi du même avis, et ils engagent les\r\nmarchands à se soumettre; mais ils déclarent que pour eux ils ne sont\r\nmaîtres de rien. Tel était leur langage en public; mais en particulier,\r\nun des marchands qui était chargé d'équiper le navire, protesta qu'il\r\nn'y mettrait rien; que la Reine, si elle le voulait, pouvait lui [6]\r\nôter son droit, mais que pour lui, il ne le céderait pas autrement.\r\n\r\nQue faire? Certainement tout était arrêté; car cette société n'avait\r\npas de contrat écrit, et ces sortes d'engagements entre gens nobles ne\r\nse mettent pas ordinairement sur papier. On ne pouvait donc pas agir\r\ncontre ces hérétiques.\r\n\r\nOn s'adresse de nouveau à la Reine. A la vue d'une pareille\r\neffronterie, elle dit en manière de proverbe: \"Il ne faut s'abaisser à\r\nprier des vilains\"; et elle ajouta que les Pères partiraient une autre\r\nfois.\r\n\r\nLes catholiques consternés déclarent alors aux hérétiques que les\r\nJésuites ne monteront pas dans ce vaisseau, qu'ils peuvent en\r\nconséquence le fréter, et que, dans tous les cas, si les Jésuites y\r\nprenaient place, ils payeraient auparavant eux-mêmes le prix de la\r\ncargaison.\r\n\r\nCette assurance une fois donnée, on vit à nu toute la malice des\r\ncalvinistes; car ils chargèrent aussitôt le navire complétement et de\r\nmarchandises et de toute espèce d'objets, ne pouvant s'imaginer que les\r\ncatholiques pussent jamais trouver de quoi payer le prix de tant de\r\nchoses.\r\n\r\nA cette nouvelle, Madame la marquise de Guercheville, première dame\r\nd'honneur de la Reine, [7] s'indigna de voir les efforts de l'enfer\r\nprévaloir et la malice des hommes pervers détruire ces grandes\r\nespérances que l'on avait de procurer la gloire de Dieu. C'est\r\npourquoi, afin que Satan ne demeurât pas le maître et ne renversât pas\r\nl'espoir que l'on avait de fonder une église au Canada, elle sollicita\r\nelle-même les aumônes des Grands, des Princes et de toute la Cour pour\r\nsoustraire les Jésuites à la méchanceté des hérétiques.\r\n\r\nQu'arriva-t-il? Le navire déjà chargé était prêt à prendre la mer,\r\nquand cette dame envoya aux catholiques 4,000 livres avec d'autres\r\nsecours. Alors, pour ne pas agir par surprise, ils vont dire\r\nadroitement aux hérétiques qu'ils veulent avoir avec eux les Jésuites,\r\nque telle est la volonté de la Reine, et que, par conséquent, il faut\r\nqu'ils les laissent monter dans le vaisseau, ou bien que les marchands\r\nacceptent le prix de la cargaison et qu'ils se retirent. Ceux-ci\r\ndéclarent qu'ils veulent le prix de leurs marchandises (Je crois qu'ils\r\nne pensaient pas que les catholiques eussent assez d'argent, ou qu'ils\r\nespéraient trouver quelque autre moyen de déjouer leurs projets). On\r\nleur donne le prix demandé, et ce à quoi personne ne se serait attendu,\r\nnous sommes si pleinement substitués à leur place, que la moitié du\r\nbâtiment nous appartient, et que nous avons déjà ce qu'il faut pour\r\ncommencer [8] cette fondation que le Seigneur daignera bénir dans sa\r\ngénérosité et dans sa bonté.\r\n\r\nAinsi donc, mon Très-Révérend et bon Père, Votre Paternité voit combien\r\nla malice du démon et de ses suppôts a tourné à notre avantage. Nous\r\nne demandions d'abord qu'un petit coin dans ce vaisseau, et à prix\r\nd'argent; maintenant nous y sommes les maîtres. Nous allions dans une\r\nrégion déserte, sans grande espérance d'un secours de longue durée, et\r\nnous recevons déjà le commencement de la fondation. Nous étions forcés\r\nd'enrichir les hérétiques d'une partie de nos aumônes, et maintenant\r\nils renoncent d'eux-mêmes à profiter d'une occasion qui les devait\r\nenrichir.\r\n\r\nMais je crois que le grand sujet de leur douleur, c'est précisément le\r\ntriomphe du Seigneur Jésus; et fasse le ciel qu'il triomphe toujours!\r\nAinsi soit-il!\r\n\r\nDieppe, le 21 janvier 1611.\r\n\r\n  De Votre Paternité\r\n\r\n  Le fils en Jésus-Christ et le serviteur indigne,\r\n  PIERRE BIARD S. J.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I.] Nous ajouterons aux lettres de nos premiers missionnaires au\r\nCanada un fragment d'un mémoire intitulé: _Monumenta Novæ Franciæ,\r\nab anno 1607, ad annum 1737.--Insulæ Martinicæ ab anno 1678.--Insulæ\r\nCayennensis ab anno 1668._\r\n\r\nLa traduction du chapitre II de ce manuscrit, conservé dans nos\r\narchives de Rome, donnera un ensemble de faits sur la Nouvelle- [2]\r\nFrance, qui ne se trouve pas dans les lettres que nous publions.\r\n\r\nParmi les gentilshommes qui s'offrirent à Henri-le-Grand, d'heureuse\r\nmémoire, pour entreprendre la colonisation de la Nouvelle-France, était\r\nle sieur de Potrincourt. Le roi lui accorda tout ce qu'il demandait,\r\nmais en lui signifiant qu'il aurait à emmener avec lui des religieux\r\npris dans notre Compagnie pour les employer, selon ses ordres, à\r\nprocurer le salut des sauvages; que du reste la dépense de cette\r\nmission ne serait nullement à sa charge, mais que le Trésor royal y\r\npourvoirait.\r\n\r\nLe R. P. Pierre Coton, alors confesseur et prédicateur du roi, et qui\r\nétait fort estimé de Sa Majesté, comme on sait, fut chargé par lui de\r\nchoisir, dans sa Compagnie, des hommes capables, pour mener à bien\r\ncette périlleuse et sainte entreprise.\r\n\r\nBeaucoup de nos religieux s'offrirent pour cette mission lointaine.\r\nParmi eux on remarquait le P. Pierre Biard, homme dont la vertu égalait\r\nle talent, et qui occupait alors la chaire de théologie à Lyon. Le\r\nchoix des supérieurs tomba sur lui et sur le P. Ennemond Masse, dont\r\nnous aurons à parler plus loin.\r\n\r\nIls partirent tous les deux en 1608 pour Bordeaux, où ils devaient\r\ns'embarquer, mais il fallut attendre trois ans. Car le gentilhomme,\r\ndont nous avons déjà parlé, retarda son départ; puis ensuite il\r\nprétexta la nécessité de faire un voyage d'essai, afin, disait-il, de\r\npréparer une habitation convenable pour les Pères. Il fit en effet ce\r\nvoyage accompagné d'un prêtre séculier, lequel, se laissant aller à un\r\nzèle peu réfléchi, baptisa une centaine de sauvages, sans les avoir\r\nsuffisamment instruits et éprouvés. Plus tard, on s'aperçut que ces\r\npauvres gens n'avaient pas même compris ce qu'ils avaient reçu.\r\n\r\nTrois ans après, de retour de son voyage, le sieur de Potrincourt,\r\npressé par la reine-mère, se chargea de conduire nos Pères au [3]\r\nCanada. Mais ce ne fut pas sans grandes difficultés et beaucoup de\r\nsouffrances que nos Pères arrivèrent au Port-Royal, sur les côtes de\r\nl'Acadie.\r\n\r\nL'année qui suivit leur arrivée, deux autres des Nôtres allèrent les\r\nrejoindre: ce furent le P. Quentin et le Frère coadjuteur Gilbert\r\ndu Thet. Deux ans de séjour à Port-Royal démontrèrent à nos Pères\r\nl'impossibilité de fixer là le centre de leur mission, soit à cause de\r\nla difficulté d'y attirer un grand concours de sauvages, soit à cause\r\ndes tracasseries de ceux qui commandaient. Ils transportèrent le siége\r\nde leur mission sur un autre point de la même côte, au 45e degré 30\r\nminutes de latitude, et cela sur un décret du roi. Cette fondation prit\r\nle nom de Saint-Sauveur. Ils y étaient établis depuis peu de temps,\r\nlorsque les anglais, survenant à l'improviste, s'emparèrent du vaisseau\r\nfrançais, saisirent les lettres-patentes du commandant, et, par une\r\ninsigne fourberie, le traitèrent de pirate. Au moment de l'attaque,\r\nplusieurs français furent tués, et parmi eux le frère Gilbert du Thet,\r\nhomme remarquable par son courage et sa piété.\r\n\r\nLes anglais victorieux, après avoir pillé tout à leur aise,\r\nabandonnèrent dans une mauvaise barque une partie de français, et\r\nemmenèrent avec eux, en Virginie, les PP. Biard et Quentin. Nos deux\r\nprisonniers s'attendaient à être condamnés à mort, surtout lorsque,\r\nreconduits à Port-Royal, ils refusèrent de faire connaître la retraite\r\ndes français qui se tenaient cachés dans les environs. Dirigés une\r\nseconde fois sur la Virginie, ils y auraient probablement trouvé la\r\nmort, si la divine Providence n'eût rendu inutiles tous les efforts des\r\nmarins anglais pour y aborder. La violence de la tempête les rejeta\r\nsur les îles Açores appartenant aux portugais, et où, malgré eux, ils\r\nfurent obligés de prendre terre.\r\n\r\nLes anglais eux-mêmes furent forcés d'admirer la loyauté et la [4]\r\ncharité de nos Pères qui, en se montrant aux portugais, pouvaient\r\namener la saisie du navire et faire condamner les anglais, comme\r\npirates, au dernier supplice. Avant d'entrer dans le port, ils avaient\r\nexigé de leurs prisonniers la promesse de ne pas les dénoncer et de\r\nse tenir cachés durant tout leur séjour aux Açores. Pendant la visite\r\ndu vaisseau faite par les portugais, les Pères restèrent à fond de\r\ncale, où ils échappèrent à tous les regards. Cette générosité et cette\r\nfidélité à garder la parole donnée surprirent tellement les anglais,\r\nqu'ils changèrent immédiatement de procédés envers leurs captifs et les\r\nemmenèrent directement en Angleterre, où ils firent publiquement leur\r\néloge.\r\n\r\nL'ambassadeur de France, à la nouvelle de leur arrivée, se hâta de les\r\nréclamer et les fit reconduire honorablement dans leur patrie, au mois\r\nde mai 1614.\r\n\r\nCe premier voyage de nos missionnaires, si stérile en apparence, eut\r\ncependant d'heureux résultats. Outre l'expérience acquise et dont on\r\nprofita, le zèle des catholiques français, ranimé par les paroles des\r\nPères, créa de nouvelles ressources, et dès que la colonie française\r\nfut délivrée des anglais, les Jésuites reprirent la route du Canada, où\r\nils fondèrent enfin une des plus belles missions de la Compagnie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FIRST MISSION OF THE JESUITS IN CANADA.[II.][26]\r\n\r\nLetter from Father Pierre Biard,[27] to the Very Reverend Father Claude\r\nAquaviva,[28] General of the Society of Jesus, Rome.\r\n\r\n(_Translated from the Latin original, preserved in the Archives of\r\nJesus, at Rome_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  DIEPPE, January 21st, 1611.[29]\r\n\r\n  MY VERY REVEREND FATHER,\r\n  The peace of Christ be with you.\r\n\r\nWould that I could recount how great and numerous have been the mercies\r\nof God, the fruits of his blessing and, of our prayers in this our\r\nlittle enterprise; that is to say, how [2] we have emerged from grave\r\nand multiplied difficulties, and how, delivered from every obstacle,\r\nwe depart for New France, the place to which we [3] are bound, as Your\r\nReverence knows. For this you may rejoice with great consolation in the\r\nname of the Lord.\r\n\r\n[4] But it has already struck midnight, and we are to sail at break of\r\nday, so I shall give you only a summary of the events which have taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhen the heretic merchants saw us at Dieppe, upon the day fixed for\r\nour departure, the 27th of October of last year, 1610 (we had, in\r\nfact, agreed to sail from Dieppe), they contrived a plan which they\r\nconsidered capable of injuring us. Two of them[31] had made a contract\r\nwith Monsieur de Potrincourt to load and equip his ship, [5] in which\r\nwe were to make the voyage. They straightway declared that they would\r\nhave nothing more to do with the vessel, if it were going to carry\r\nany Jesuits. It was a remarkable exhibition of malice, as was easy to\r\nprove, especially when the catholics informed them that they were in\r\nduty bound not to reject the Jesuits, since it was the formal order of\r\nthe Queen.[32]\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing could be gained from them, and the Catholics were\r\nagain obliged to have recourse to the Queen. Her Majesty writes to the\r\ngovernor of the city, a zealous and pious catholic, and charges him to\r\ninform the heretics that it is her will that the Jesuits be received in\r\nthe ship which is about to depart for New France, and that no obstacle\r\nbe put in their way.\r\n\r\nWhen these letters are received, the governor assembles what is called\r\nthe consistory, namely, all faithful disciples of Calvin. He reads the\r\nQueen's letters and urges them to be obedient. Some of them, namely,\r\nthose who were well disposed toward us, boldly declare that they also\r\nare of the same opinion; and they try to induce the merchants to yield.\r\nBut they declare that for their part they are not the masters. At\r\nleast they say this in public; but in private one of the merchants who\r\nwas charged with fitting out the vessel, protested that he would put\r\nnothing into it; that the Queen, if she wished, could deprive him [6]\r\nof his right, but that he certainly would not yield it otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? In truth, all proceedings were at a standstill;\r\nfor this society had no written contract, since agreements of this kind\r\namong noblemen are not usually put upon paper. Therefore they could not\r\nprosecute these heretics.\r\n\r\nThey address themselves anew to the Queen. In the presence of such\r\neffrontery she quoted the words of the proverb: \"Never stoop to entreat\r\na churl,\" and added that the Fathers should go another time.\r\n\r\nThe dismayed catholics then declare to the heretics that the Jesuits\r\nwill not embark upon their vessel, and that consequently they may go\r\non freighting it; and that, in any event, if the Jesuits did occupy a\r\nplace therein, they themselves would first pay the price of the cargo.\r\n\r\nThis assurance once given, the malice of these calvinists was exposed\r\nin all its nakedness; for they immediately loaded every part of the\r\nship not only with merchandise, but with all kinds of goods, never\r\ndreaming that the catholics would be able to find the means of paying\r\nfor all these things.\r\n\r\nAt this news, the marchioness de Guercheville, first lady of honor to\r\nthe Queen, [7] was indignant at seeing the forces of hell prevail, and\r\nthe malice of wicked men destroy one's strong hopes of securing the\r\nglory of God.[33] Therefore, in order to prevent the triumph of Satan\r\nand the overthrow of their hopes of founding a church in Canada, she\r\nherself solicited alms from Nobles, Princes, and from all the Court, to\r\nrescue the Jesuits from the malevolence of the heretics.\r\n\r\nWhat happened? The ship, already loaded, was about to sail, when\r\nthis lady sent to the catholics 4,000 livres, with other means of\r\nassistance. Then, not to be underhand, they go directly to the heretics\r\nand say that they want the Jesuits to go with them, that such is the\r\nwill of the Queen; and so consequently they must allow them to embark,\r\nor else the merchants must accept the price of the cargo and withdraw.\r\nThe latter declare that they want the value of their merchandise. (I\r\nbelieve they did not think the catholics would have enough money, or\r\nelse they hoped to baffle them by some other means.) They give them\r\nthe price they asked; and, what no one could have expected, we so\r\ncompletely take their place, that half the ship belongs to us, and we\r\nhave already means enough to begin [8] laying the foundation, which the\r\nLord, in his generosity and goodness, will condescend to bless.\r\n\r\nSo now, my Very Reverend and good Father, you see how entirely the\r\nmalice of the evil one and of his tools has been turned to our\r\nadvantage. At first we only asked a little corner in this vessel at\r\ntheir price. Now we are masters of it. We were going into a dreary\r\nwilderness, without much hope of permanent help; and we have already\r\nreceived enough to begin laying the foundation. We were to enrich the\r\nheretics by a portion of our alms; and now they, of their own accord,\r\nrefuse to profit by an occasion which was to benefit them.\r\n\r\nBut I believe that the great source of their grief, is nothing else\r\nthan the triumph of the Lord Jesus; and may heaven grant that he always\r\ntriumph! Amen!\r\n\r\nDieppe, January 21, 1611.\r\n\r\n  Of Your Reverence,\r\n\r\n  The son and unworthy servant in Jesus Christ,\r\n  PIERRE BIARD S. J.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[II.] We shall add to the letters of our first missionaries to Canada\r\na fragment of a memoir entitled: _Records of New France, from the year\r\n1607 to the year 1737.--Of the Island of Martinique from the year\r\n1678.--Of the Island of Cayenne from the year 1668._\r\n\r\nThe translation of chapter II. of this manuscript, preserved in our\r\narchives at Rome, will give a collection of facts about New [2] France,\r\nwhich are not found in the letters we publish.\r\n\r\nAmong the gentlemen who offered themselves to Henry the Great, of happy\r\nmemory, to undertake the colonization of New France, was sieur de\r\nPotrincourt. The king granted him all that he asked, but at the same\r\ntime gave him to understand that he must take with him some religious\r\npersons from our Society for the purpose of securing, according to his\r\norders, the salvation of the savages; furthermore, that the expense\r\nof this mission would in no respect devolve upon him, but would be\r\nprovided for from the royal Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Father Pierre Coton, then confessor and preacher to the\r\nking, and who was very highly esteemed by His Majesty, as we know, was\r\ncommissioned by him to select, from his Society, some men capable of\r\nconducting to a successful issue this perilous and holy enterprise.\r\n\r\nMany of our religious offered themselves for this distant mission.\r\nAmong them was noticed Father Pierre Biard, a man whose integrity\r\nequaled his talent and who then occupied the chair of theology at\r\nLyons. The choice of the superiors fell upon him and upon Father\r\nEnnemond Masse, of whom we shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nThey both departed in 1608 for Bordeaux, where they intended to embark,\r\nbut they were obliged to wait three years. For the gentleman, of whom\r\nwe have already spoken, postponed his departure; then he offered as\r\nan excuse the necessity of making a trial voyage, in order, said\r\nhe, to prepare a suitable dwelling for the Fathers. In fact he did\r\nmake this journey, accompanied by a secular priest, who, yielding\r\nto a thoughtless zeal, baptized a hundred savages without having\r\nsufficiently instructed and tested them. Later, it was discovered that\r\nthese poor people had not even understood what they had received.\r\n\r\nThree years afterwards, on returning from his voyage, sieur de\r\nPotrincourt, urged by the queen-mother, undertook to convey our Fathers\r\nto [3] Canada. But it was not without great difficulty and much\r\nsuffering that they reached Port Royal, upon the coast of Acadia.\r\n\r\nThe year following their arrival, two others of our Society went\r\nto join them, namely, Father Quentin and Gilbert du Thet, a\r\nBrother-coadjutor.[30] A two years' sojourn in Port Royal demonstrated\r\nto them the impossibility of making that the center of their mission,\r\neither on account of the difficulty of attracting there a great\r\nassemblage of savages, or because of the bickerings of those in\r\ncommand. They transferred the seat of their mission to another point\r\nupon the same coast, in latitude 45° 30', according to a decree of the\r\nking. This settlement received the name of Saint Savior. They had been\r\nestablished there but a short time, when the English, coming upon them\r\nsuddenly, took possession of the French ship, seized the letters-patent\r\nof the commander, and, by a piece of outrageous rascality, treated him\r\nas a pirate. At the moment of attack several Frenchmen were killed, and\r\namong them brother Gilbert du Thet, a man remarkable for his courage\r\nand piety.\r\n\r\nThe victorious English, after having pillaged as much as they liked,\r\nabandoned part of the French in a miserable bark, and took with them\r\nto Virginia Fathers Biard and Quentin. Our two prisoners expected\r\nto be condemned to death, especially when, being taken back to Port\r\nRoyal they refused to make known the hiding-place of the French who\r\nwere concealed in the neighborhood. Turning their course a second time\r\ntoward Virginia, they would probably have met death there, had not\r\ndivine Providence frustrated all the efforts of the English sailors\r\nto land. A violent storm cast them upon the Azores islands, which\r\nbelong to Portugal; and there, in spite of all their efforts, they were\r\nobliged to disembark.\r\n\r\nEven the English were forced to admire the loyalty and charity [4]\r\nof our Fathers, who, by showing themselves to the Portuguese, might\r\nhave caused the seizure of the ship, and had the English condemned\r\nand executed as pirates. Before entering port they exacted from their\r\nprisoners the promise not to denounce them, and to keep themselves\r\nconcealed during their entire sojourn at the Azores. While the\r\nPortuguese were visiting the ship, the Fathers remained in the bottom\r\nof the hold, where they escaped observation. This generosity and\r\nloyalty in keeping their word so surprised the English that they\r\nimmediately changed their treatment of their captives, and took them\r\ndirectly to England, where they publicly eulogized them.\r\n\r\nThe French ambassador, on hearing of their arrival, hastened to reclaim\r\nthem, and had them taken back honorably into their own country, in the\r\nmonth of May, 1614.\r\n\r\nThis first voyage of our missionaries, apparently so futile, had,\r\nhowever, fortunate results. Beside the experience acquired, of which\r\ngood use was made, the zeal of French catholics, revived by the stories\r\nof the Fathers, created new resources; and as soon as the French colony\r\nwas delivered from the English, the Jesuits resumed their voyages to\r\nCanada, where they finally founded one of the finest missions of the\r\nSociety.--[Carayon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] Lettre du P.

Par la\r\nmisericorde de Dieu et par les prieres de Vostre Reverence et de nos\r\nbons Peres et Freres, nous voicy au bout de nostre course, et au lieu\r\ntant souhaité. Voicy aussi la premiere commodité qui se presente pour\r\nescrire à Vostre Reverence, et lui faire sçavoir de nos nouvelles et de\r\nl'estat auquel nous nous retrouvons. Je suis marry que le peu de temps\r\nde nostre arrivée en ce pays ne me permette pas d'en discourir, et\r\ncomme je désirerois [10] plus amplement, et de l'estat de cette pauvre\r\nnation; neantmoins je m'efforceray de vous descrire non-seulement\r\nce qui s'est passé en nostre voyage, mais aussy tout ce qu'avons\r\npeu apprendre de ce peuple depuis que nous y sommes, selon que, je\r\npense, tous nos bons seigneurs et amis avec Vostre Reverence (doivent)\r\nl'attendre et le desirer.\r\n\r\nEt, pour commencer par le préparatif de nostre voyage, Vostre Reverence\r\naura sceu l'effort que firent deux marchants de Dieppe de la religion\r\npretendue, qui avoient charge de fretter le navire, pour empescher que\r\nn'y fussions reçus. Il y avoit jà quelques années que ceux qui avoient\r\ncommencé et continué le voyage de Canada, avoient desiré quelques uns\r\nde nostre Compagnie pour s'employer à la conversion de ce peuple là; et\r\nle feu Roy d'heureuse memoire Henry le Grand avoit assigné cinq cents\r\nescus pour le voyage des premiers qui y seroient envoyés, quand le R.\r\nP. Enmond Masse et moy, deputés pour ce voyage, après avoir salué la\r\nReyne Regente, entendu de sa propre bouche le saint zele qu'elle avoit\r\nde la conversion de ces peuples barbares, reçu les susdicts cinq cents\r\nescus pour nostre viatique, aydés aussi de la pieuse libéralité de\r\nMesdames les Marquises de Guercheville, Verneuil et de Sourdis, partis\r\nde Paris, arrivasmes à Dieppe au jour que nous avait assigné [11]\r\nMonsieur de Biancourt, fils de Monsieur de Potrincourt, pour nous y\r\nprendre, sçavoir le 27 d'Octobre 1610.\r\n\r\nLes deux susdicts marchants, aussitost qu'ils ouïrent que deux Iesuites\r\ndebvoient aller au Canada, s'adresserent à Monsieur de Biancourt[III.]\r\net luy denoncerent que si lesdicts Iesuites entroient au navire, ils\r\nn'y vouloient rien avoir. On leur respondit que la venuë des Iesuites\r\nne leur nuyroit en rien; que, Dieu mercy et la Reyne, ils avoient\r\nmoyen de payer leur pension sans grever aucunement leur fret. Ils\r\npersistent toute fois en leur negative; et quoyque Monsieur de Sicoine,\r\ngouverneur de la ville, fort zelé catholique, s'en entremeslast de\r\nbonne affection, si ne pût-il rien obtenir d'eux. A cette cause,\r\nMonsieur Robbin,[IV.] le fils, autrement de Coloigne, associé avec\r\nMonsieur de Biancourt pour le voyage, se delibera d'aller en Cour et\r\ndéclarer à la Reyne cet accrochement; ce qu'il fit. La Reyne sur cela\r\ndonna lettres addressantes à Monsieur de Sicoigne, à ce qu'il eust à\r\ndeclarer la volonté du Roy à present regnant, être telle, et avoir\r\npareillement [12] esté telle celle du feu Roy d'eternelle memoire,\r\nque lesdicts Iesuites allent en Canada; et par ainsy entendissent les\r\ncontrariants sur ce fait, qu'ils se trouveroient en opposition contre\r\nle bon plaisir de leur Prince. Les lettres estoient fort affectueuses;\r\net plût à Monsieur de Sicoigne de mander à soy tout le consistoire, et\r\nleur en faire lecture. Si est-ce que pour tout cela, les marchants sus\r\nmentionnés ne voulurent en rien démordre; seulement fut accordé que,\r\nlaissant à part la question des Iésuites, on chargeroit promptement\r\nle vaisseau, de peur que cet embarras et dispute n'apportast du\r\nretardement au secours qui promptement debvoit estre donné à Monsieur\r\nde Potrincourt.\r\n\r\nLors je pensois bien quasi toutes nos attentes estre mises au rouët, et\r\nne sçavois quelle clef nous en pourroit assez desgager. Mais Monsieur\r\nde Coloigne ne desespera point; ains, se montrant de sa grâce toujours\r\nplus ardent à poursuivre pour nous, fit entendre en Cour, par un\r\nsecond voyage qu'il fit, y avoir bien moyen de debouter les susdits\r\nmarchants, sçavoir est, en leur payant leur marchandise, et ainsi\r\nles dédommageant. Madame de la Guercheville, dame de grande vertu,\r\nrecognoissant cet expédient, et jugeant n'estre convenable à la piété\r\nde la cour que pour si peu un oeuvre de Dieu fust arresté, et satan en\r\neust ainsi le [13] dessus, se délibera de faire un queste pour mettre\r\nensemble la somme de deniers requise, et le fist avec telle diligence\r\net si heureusement, par la pieuse liberalité de plusieurs des Seigneurs\r\net Dames de la cour, qu'elle assembla bientost quatre mil livres, et\r\nles envoya à Dieppe. Ainsy lesdits marchants furent exclus de tout le\r\ndroict qu'ils eussent pû avoir sur le vaisseau, sans rien perdre, et\r\nnous y fusmes introduits.\r\n\r\nCet affaire et plusieurs autres qui survinrent dans l'aprest de nostre\r\nvoyage, furent cause que ne pusmes partir de Dieppe avant le 26\r\njanvier 1611. Monsieur de Biancourt, jeune seigneur fort accomply et\r\nexpert en la maryne, estoit nostre conducteur, et chef du vaisseau.\r\nNous estions 36 personnes dans un navire appelé _la Grace de Dieu_,\r\nd'environ soixante tonneaux. Nous n'eusmes que deux jours de bon vent;\r\nau troisiesme, nous nous vismes subitement, par un vent et marées\r\ncontraires, emportés jusques à cent ou deux cents pas des esquillons\r\nl'isle d'Wytht, en Angleterre; et bien nous en print que nous y\r\nrencontrasmes bon ancrage; sans cela resoluement c'estoit faict de nous.\r\n\r\nEschappés de là, nous relaschasmes à Hyrmice et depuis à Niéport; en\r\nquoy nous consumasmes 18 jours. Le 16 de février, premier jour de\r\ncaresme, [14] un bon norouest s'élevant, nous donna moyen de partir,\r\net nous accompagna jusques hors de la Manche. Ors ont accoustumé les\r\nmariniers, venant à Port-Royal, de ne point prendre la droite route\r\ndes isles Ouessants jusqu'au Cap de Sable, ce qui abregeroit beaucoup\r\nle chemin; car en cette façon, de Dieppe à Port-Royal, n'y auroit\r\nqu'environ mil lieues; ains leur coustume est de descendre vers le Sud\r\njusqu'aux Açores, et de là tirer au grand banc, pour du grand banc,\r\nselon que les vents se présentent, viser au Cap de Sable, ou bien à\r\nCampseaux, ou bien autre part. Ils m'ont dict que pour trois raisons\r\nils descendent ainsi aux Açores: la première pour esviter la mer du\r\nnort, qui est fort haute, disent-ils; la seconde, pour s'ayder des\r\nvents du sud, qui volontiers reignent le plus; la troisiesme, pour\r\nassurer leur estime: autrement il est difficile qu'ils se recognoissent\r\net dressent leur voyage sans erreur. Mais nulle de ces causes a eu\r\neffet quant à nous, qui neantmoins avons suivy cette coustume: non la\r\npremiere, parce que nous avons experimenté tant de tempestes et la mer\r\nsi rude, que je ne pense pas y avoir beaucoup de gain, nort ou sud,\r\nsud ou nort; non la seconde, parce que souvent, quand nous voulions le\r\nSud, le Nort souffloit, et à retours; non enfin la troisiesme, d'autant\r\nque nous ne pusmes point voir ces Açores, quoyque nous fussions [15]\r\ndescendus jusqu'à 39 degrés et demy. Ainsi toute l'estime de nos\r\nconducteurs s'embrouilla, et nous n'estions pas encore aux Açores du\r\ngrand banc, quand quelques-uns opinoient que nous l'eussions desjà\r\npassé.\r\n\r\nLe grand banc aux molües n'est pas, comme j'estimois en France, quelque\r\nbanc de sablon ou terre qui apparoisse hors de la mer, ains est une\r\ngrande lisiere de terre soubs l'eau à 35, 40 et 45 brasses, large en\r\nquelques endroits de 25 lieuës. On l'appelle banc, parce que c'est là\r\npremierement où venant des abismes de l'ocean, l'on trouve terre avec\r\nla sonde. Or, sur le bord de ce grand banc, les vagues sont d'ordinaire\r\nfort furieuses trois ou quatre lieues durant, et ces trois ou quatre\r\nlieues on appelle les Açores.\r\n\r\nNous estions environ ces Açores le mardy de Pasques, quand nous\r\nvoicy en prouë notre ennemy conjuré, l'Ouest, avec telle furie et\r\nopiniastreté, que peu s'en fallut que nous ne perissions. De huict\r\njours entiers, il ne nous donna relasche, adjoustant à sa malice le\r\nfroid et souvent la pluie ou la neige.\r\n\r\nNaviger en ce traject de la Nouvelle-France, si dangereux et si\r\naspre, principalement en petits vaisseaux et mal munitionnez, est un\r\nsommaire de toutes les miseres de la vie. Nous n'avions repos ni [16]\r\njour ni nuict. Si nous pensions prendre nostre refection, nostre plat\r\nsubitement eschappoit contre la tête de quelqu'un; un autre tomboit\r\nsour nous, et nous contre quelque coffre, et tourneboulions avec\r\nd'autres pareillement renversez; nostre tasse se versoit sur nostre\r\nlict, et le bidon dans nostre seing, ou bien un coup de mer mandoit\r\nnostre plat.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Biancourt m'honoroit de tant, que je couchois dans sa\r\nchambre. Une belle nuict ainsy qu'estant au lict nous pensions prendre\r\nquelque repos, voicy qu'un gentil et hardy coup de mer qui faussa\r\nles fermetures de la fenestre, la rompt et nous vient couvrir bien\r\nhautement; autant en eusmes nous une autre fois de jour. En outre,\r\nle froid estoit si violent, et l'a esté plus de six semaines durant,\r\nqu'à peine nous sentions nous d'engourdissement et de gel. Le bon Père\r\nMasse a pati beaucoup. Il a demeuré quelques quarante jours malade sans\r\nmanger que bien peu, et quasi sans bouger du lict; encore vouloit-il\r\njeusner avec tout cela. Après Pasque, il meliora tousjours, Dieu mercy\r\nde plus en plus. Pour moy, j'estois gaillard, quand mesme plusieurs des\r\nmatelots se rendoient, et la Dieu grâce, je n'ay jamais tenu le lict\r\npour mal que j'eusse.\r\n\r\nEschappés des tourmentes, nous entrasmes dans les glaces sur les Açores\r\ndu banc, degrez du nort 46. Aucunes des glaces sembloient des isles,\r\nautres [17] des petits bourgs, autres des grandes églises ou dômes bien\r\nhaults, ou superbes chasteaux: toutes flottoient. Pour les esviter,\r\nnous prismes au sud; mais ce fut tomber, comme l'on dict, de Charybdis\r\nen Sylla, car de ces haults rochers, nous tombasmes en un pavé de\r\nbasse glace, la mer en estant toute couverte autant que la vue pouvoit\r\nporter. Nous ne savions en passer; et n'eust esté la hardiesse de M. de\r\nBiancourt, nos mariniers demeuroient sans expedient; mais il fit passer\r\noutre, non obstant le murmure de plusieurs, par où la glace estoit plus\r\nrare, et Dieu, par sa bonté, nous assista.\r\n\r\nLe 5 de may, nous descendismes à Campceau, et eusmes le moyen d'y\r\ncelebrer la sainte messe après tant de temps, et nous sustenter de\r\nce pain qui nourit sans deffaut, et console sans fin. Depuis, nous\r\ncostoyames terre jusqu'à Port-Royal, et y sommes arrivés à bons et\r\nheureux auspices le saint jour de Pencoste de bon matin, sçavoir est\r\nle 22 de may,[V.] jour auquel le soleil entre dans les Iumeaux. Nostre\r\nvoyage avoit duré quatre mois.\r\n\r\nIl n'est possible d'exprimer l'ayse que reçurent de nostre arrivée\r\nMonsieur de Potrincourt et les siens, lesquels, durant tout cet hyver,\r\nse trouvèrent [18] en de très-grandes necessités, comme je vous vais\r\ndeclarer.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Potrincourt avoit accompagné son fils revenant en France\r\nsur la fin de juillet 1610, et y estoit venu jusques au port Saint\r\nIean,[VI.] autrement dict Chachippé, distant du Port-Royal 70 lieuës\r\nest et sud. Revenant et ayant redoublé le Cap de Sable, se trouvant en\r\nla baye courante, accablé de fatigues, il fut contraint de ceder le\r\ngouvernail pour un peu dormir, donnant mandement à celuy qui succedoit\r\nde suivre toujours terre, jusqu'au plus profond de la Baye. Ce\r\nsuccesseur, ne sçay pourquoy, ne suyvit pas le commandement, ains peu\r\nde temps après changea, et abandonna terre.\r\n\r\nLe Sauvage Membertou, qui suyvoit dans sa chaloupe, fut estonné\r\nde cette route; néanmoins, n'en sçachant pas la cause, n'en imita\r\npas l'exemple, et si n'en dit rien. Aussi arriva-t-il bientost à\r\nPort-Royal, là où M. de Potrincour erra par six semaines en danger de\r\nse perdre; car le bon seigneur, s'estant esveillé, fut bien esbahy de\r\nse veoir en pleine mer, à perte de terre, dans une chaloupe. Il avait\r\nbeau regarder son cadran, car ne sçachant [19] quelle route son gentil\r\ngouverneur avoit tenué, il ne pouvoit deviner ni où il estoit, ni où\r\nil convenoit addresser. Un autre mal, sa chaloupe ne pouvoit aller à\r\nla boline,[VII.] ayant esté, ne scay comment, brisée par les flancs.\r\nAinsi, voulust-il ou non, il estoit necessité à prendre toujours vent\r\nderriere.\r\n\r\nUn tiers inconvenient et grief: ils n'avoient de vivres. Néantmoins,\r\nc'est une homme qui ne se rend pas facilement, et bonheur l'accompagne.\r\nDonc, en cette perplexité de route, il se determina heureusement de\r\nprendre au nord, et Dieu lui envoya ce qu'il souhaitoit, un favorable\r\nSud. Contre le mal de la faim, sa prudence luy servit; car il avoit\r\nchassé et gardé certain nombre de cormorans.[VIII.] Mais quel moyen\r\nde les rôtir en une chaloupe, pour les manger et garder? De bonne\r\nfortune, il se trouva avoir quelque planche, sur laquelle il dressa\r\nun foyer, et ainsi rotit son gibier, à l'ayde duquel il arriva à\r\nPentegouët, anciennement la Norembegue, et de là aux Etechemins, puis à\r\nl'embouscheure du Port-Royal, où, par desastre, il pensa faire naufrage.\r\n\r\nIl faisoit obscur quand il se trouva en cette entrée, et ses gens\r\ncommencerent à lui, contredire, [20] niant assurément que ce fust\r\nl'embouscheure du Port-Royal. Luy ouït volontiers les opinions de ses\r\ngens, et malheur qu'encore les suyvit-il, et aynsi prenant en bas de la\r\nBaye Françoise, il s'en alla roder bien loing à la mercy des vents et\r\ndes marées. Cependant ses gens estoient bien en peine au Port-Royal, et\r\njà quasi tenoient-ils pour tout assuré qu'il fust peri; à cela aydoit\r\nle sauvage Membertou, qui affirmoit luy avoir veu prendre vers la mer à\r\nperte de vuë; d'où l'on inferoit, comme l'on croit autant facilement ce\r\nque l'on craint comme ce que l'on ayme, que puisque tels ou tels vents\r\navoient régné, il estoit impossible qu'avec une chaloupe, il eust peu\r\neschapper. Et jà traitoit-on du retour en France. Or bien esbahis, et\r\nensemble bien joyeux furent-ils, quand ils virent leur Thésée, revenu\r\nde l'autre monde; ce fut six semaines après son depart, au même temps\r\nque M. de Biancourt arrivoit en France, le retour duquel estoit attendu\r\nà Port-Royal pour tout Novembre de la même annèe 1610. Mais on fut\r\nbien estonné, quand non seulement on ne le vit pas à Noël, mais aussi\r\non perdit espérance, à cause de l'hiver, de le revoir avant la fin\r\nd'apvril ensuivant.\r\n\r\nCette fut raison pour quoy on se retrancha de vivres; mais ce\r\nretranchement profitoit peu, d'autant que le Sieur de Potrincourt ne\r\nrabattoit rien [21] de ses libéralités vers les Sauvages, craingnant\r\nles aliener de la foy chrestienne. C'est un seigneur vrayment liberal\r\net magnanime, mesprisant toute recompense des biens qu'il leur fait;\r\nde maniere que les Sauvages, quand par fois on leur demande pourquoy\r\nils ne lui redonnent quelque chose pour tant de biens qu'il leur faict,\r\nont de coustumes de respondre malitieusement: _Endries ninan metaij\r\nSagamo_: c'est-à-dire, Monsieur ne se soucie point de nos peaux de\r\ncastor. Néantmoins ils envoyoient par fois quelques pieces d'orignac,\r\nqui aydoyent à toujours gagner le temps. Or, bon moyen pour espargner,\r\nvoicy que, l'hyver venu, leur moulin se glace, et n'y avoit moyen de\r\nfaire farine. Bon pour eux, qu'ils trouverent provision de pois et\r\nfebves; cette fut leur manne et ambroisie sept semaines durant.\r\n\r\nLà estoit venu Apvril, mais non pas le navire, et lors le moulin eut\r\nbeau se glacer, car aussi bien n'y avoit-il rien pour la tremye. Que\r\nfera-on? la faim est un meschant mal. On se met à pescher sur eau, et\r\nfouiller soubs terre: sur eau, on eut des esplans et du harang; soubs\r\nterre, on trouva de fort bonnes racines, qu'on appelle _chiqueli_, et\r\nabondent fort en de certains endroits.\r\n\r\nAinsi contentoit-on aucunement cet importun crediteur; je dis\r\naucunement parce que, le pain leur [22] manquant, toute autre chose\r\nleur estoit peu, et jà faisoit-on estat que, si le navire ne venoit\r\npour tout le mois de may, que l'on se mettroit par la coste en\r\nrecherche de quelques navires, pour repasser au doux pays de froment et\r\nvignoble. C'estoyent les gens de Monsieur de Potrincourt qui parloient\r\nainsi; car pour luy, il avoit le courage, et si sçavoit bien les moyens\r\nde faire attendre jusques à la saint Iean. Il n'en fut pas de besoing,\r\nDieu mercy, car comme dict est, nous arrivasmes le 22 de may. Or si,\r\nà cette venue, l'allegresse de Monsieur de Potrincourt et de ceux de\r\nl'habitation fut grande, ceux là le pourront conjecturer, qui sçavent\r\nce que c'est de la faim, du desespoir, de la crainte, de patir, d'estre\r\npere, et veoir ses entreprises et travaux à volleau.\r\n\r\nNous pleurasmes tous au rencontre, et nous estimions quasi songer;\r\npuis, quand nous fusmes un peu revenus et entrez en propos, cette\r\nquestion fut mise en avant, sçavoir: mon (de vrai) qui estoit le plus\r\nayse des deux, ou M. de Potrincourt et les siens, ou M. de Biancourt\r\net nous. De vray, nous avions bien tous le coeur bien eslargy, et\r\nDieu, par sa misericorde, donna signe d'y prendre plaisir; car, après\r\nla messe et le disner, comme ce ne fusse qu'allée et venue du navire\r\nà l'habitation et de l'habitation au [23] navire, chacun voulant\r\ncaresser, et estre caressé de ses amis, comme après l'hyver on se\r\nresjouït du beau temps, et après le siége de la liberté, il arriva que\r\ndeux de l'habitation prindrent un canot des sauvages pour aller au\r\nnavire. Ces canots sont tellement faits que, si on ne s'y tient pas\r\nbien juste et à plomb, aussitost on vire; arriva donc que, voulant\r\nretourner dans le mesme canot du navire à l'habitation ne sçay comment\r\nne charrierent pas droict, et eux dans l'eau.\r\n\r\nLe bonheur porta que pour lors je me promenois avec M. de Potrincourt\r\nà la rive. Nous voyons l'accident, et, à nostre pouvoir faisions\r\nsigne avec nos chapeaux à ceux du navire, de courir au secours; car\r\nde crier, rien n'eust proffité, tant le navire estoit esloigné, et le\r\nvent faisoit du bruit. Personne n'y prenoit garde du commencement; de\r\nmaniere que nostre recours fut à l'oraison, et de nous mettre à genou,\r\nn'y voyant autre remede; et Dieu eut pitié de nous. L'un des deux se\r\nsaisit du canot renversé, et se jette dessus; l'autre, à la parfin,\r\nfut secouru d'une chaloupe, et tous deux ainsi retirez et sauvez nous\r\ncomblerent de liesse, voyant comme la bonté divine, par sa toute\r\nparternelle douceur, n'avoit point voulu permettre que le malin esprit\r\nnous enviast et funestast un si bon jour. A elle soit gloire à tout\r\njamays. Ainsy soit-il.\r\n\r\n[24] Or maintenant il est temps qu'arrivés par la grâce de Dieu en\r\nsanté nous jettions les yeux sur le pays, et y considerions un peu\r\nl'estat de la chrestienté que nous y trouvons. Tout son fondement\r\nconsiste après Dieu en cette petite habitation d'une famille\r\nd'environ vingt personnes. Messire Iessé Flesche, vulgairement dict\r\nle Patriarche, en a eu la charge, et, dans un an qu'il y a demeuré, a\r\nbaptizé quelque cent ou tant des Sauvages. Le mal a esté qu'il ne les\r\na pu instruire comme il eust bien désiré, faute de sçavoir la langue,\r\net avoir de quoy les entretenir; car celui qui leur nourrit l'âme\r\nfaut quand et quand qu'il se delibere de sustenter leur corps. Ce bon\r\npersonnage nous a fait beaucoup d'amitié, et a remercié Dieu de nostre\r\nvenue; car il avoit jà de longtemps resolu de repasser en France à la\r\npremiere commodité; ce qu'il est bien ayse de faire maintenant, sans le\r\nregret d'abandonner une vigne qu'il auroit plantée.\r\n\r\nOn n'a pû jusques à maintenant traduire au langage du pays la croyance\r\ncommune ou symbole, l'oraison de nostre Seigneur, les commandemens de\r\nDieu, les Sacremens et autres chefs totalement necessaires à faire un\r\nchrestien.\r\n\r\nEstant dernièrement au port Saint-Iean, je fus adverty qu'entre les\r\nautres Sauvages, il y en avoit cinq jà chrestiens. Ie prends de là\r\noccasion de leur [25] donner des images, et planter une croix devant\r\nleur cabane, chantant un _Salve Regina_. Ie leur fis faire le signe\r\nde la croix; mais je me trouvois bien esbahy, car autant quasi y\r\nentendoient les non-baptizés, que les chrestiens. Ie demandois à un\r\nchacun son nom de baptesme; quelques-uns ne le sçavoient pas, et\r\nceux-là s'appeloient _Patriarches_; et la cause est parce que c'est le\r\nPatriarche qui leur impose le nom; car ils concluënt ainsy, il faut\r\nqu'ils s'appellent _Patriarches_, quand ils ont oublié leur vray nom.\r\n\r\nIl y eut aussi pour rire, car lorsque je leur demandois s'ils estoient\r\nchrestiens, ils ne m'entendoient pas; quand je leur demandois s'ils\r\nestoient baptizés, ils me respondoient: _Hetaion enderquir Vortmandia\r\nPatriarché_; c'est à-dire: \"Oui, le Patriarche nous a fait semblables\r\naux Normans.\" Or, appellent-ils Normans tous les Françoys hormis les\r\nMalouins, qu'ils appellent Samaricois, et les Basques qu'ils disent\r\nBascua.\r\n\r\nLe _sagamo_, c'est-à-dire le seigneur du port Saint-Iean, est un\r\nappelé Cacagous, fin et matois s'il n'y en a point en la coste; c'est\r\ntout ce qu'il a rapporté de France (car il a esté en France), et me\r\ndisoit qu'il avoit esté baptizé à Bajonne, me racontant cela comme\r\nqui raconteroit d'avoir esté par amitié conduit à un bal. Sur quoy,\r\nvoyant le mal, et [26] voulant esprouver si je luy esmouverois point\r\nla conscience, je luy demandois combien il avoit de femmes. Il me\r\nrespondit qu'il en avoit huict; et de fait, il m'en compta sept, qu'il\r\navoit là presentes, me les désignant avec autant de gloire, tant s'en\r\nfaut qu'avec honte, comme si je luy eusse demandé combien il avoit de\r\nfils legitimes.\r\n\r\nUn autre, qui cherchoit plusieurs femmes, comme je luy dissuadasse,\r\nluy alleguant qu'il estoit chrestien, me paya de cette response:\r\n_Reroure quiro Nortmandia_: c'est à-dire Cela est bon pour vous\r\nautres, Normans. Aussi ne voit-on gueres de changement en eux après le\r\nbaptesme. La mesme sauvagine et les mesmes moeurs demeurent, ou peu\r\ns'en faut, mesmes coustumes, ceremonies, us, façons et vices, au moins\r\nà ce qu'on en peut sçavoir, sans point observer aucune distinction de\r\ntemps, jours, offices, exercices, prieres, debvoirs, vertus ou remedes\r\nspirituels.\r\n\r\nMembertou, comme celuy qui hante le plus M. de Potrincourt dés long\r\ntemps, est aussi le plus zelé, et montre le plus de foy; mais encore\r\nil se plaint de ne nous pas assez entendre, et desireroit d'estre\r\nprescheur, dit-il, s'il estoit bien instruict. Ce fut luy qui me fit\r\nl'autre jour une plaisante repartie; car, comme je luy enseignois son\r\n_Pater_, selon la traduction que m'en a fait M. de Biancourt, sur ce\r\n[27] que je lui faisois dire: _Nui en caraco nac iquem esmoi ciscou_;\r\nc'est-à-dire, donne-nous aujourd'huy nostre pain quotidien. \"Mais,\r\ndit-il, si je ne luy demandois que du pain, je demeurerois sans orignac\r\nou poisson.\"\r\n\r\nLe bon vieillard nous contoit avec grande affection comme Dieu\r\nl'assiste depuis qu'il est chrestien, et nous disoit que ce printemps,\r\nluy arriva de patir grande faim luy et les siens; que sur ce il luy\r\nsouvint qu'il estoit chrestien, et par ce il pria Dieu. Après sa\r\nprière, allant veoir à la riviere, il trouva des esplans à suffisance.\r\nEt puisque je suis sur ce vieux sagamo, premices de cette gentilité, je\r\nvous diray encore ce qui luy est arrivé cet hyver.\r\n\r\nIl a esté malade, et ce qui est plus, jugé à mort par les _aoutmoins_\r\nou sorciers du pays. Or est la coustume que dès aussitost que les\r\nAoutmoins ont sentencié la maladie ou plaie estre mortelle, dès lors\r\nle patient ne mange plus; aussy ne luy donne-t-on rien. Ains, prenant\r\nsa belle robe, il entonne luy-mesme le chant de sa mort; après lequel\r\ncantique, s'il tarde trop à mourir, on luy jette force seaux d'eau\r\ndessus, pour l'advancer, et quelquefois l'enterre-t-on à demy vif. Or\r\nles enfants de Membertou, quoy que chrestien, se preparoient à user\r\nde ce beau devoir de pieté envers leur père; jà ils ne luy donnoient\r\nplus à manger, et luy ayant prins sa [28] belle robe de loutre, avoit,\r\ncomme un cygne, chanté et conclu sa Nænie ou chant funerail. Une chose\r\nl'affligeoit encore, c'est qu'il ne sçavoit pas pomment il debvoit\r\nbien mourir en chrestien, et qu'il ne disoit point adieu à M. de\r\nPotrincourt. Ces choses entendues, M. de Potrincourt vint à luy, luy\r\nremonstre et l'asseure qu'en despit de tous les Aoutmoins et Pilotois,\r\nil vivroit et recouvreroit santé, s'il vouloit manger; ce qu'il estoit\r\ntenu de faire, estant chrestien. Le bon homme crut, et fut sauvé;\r\naujourd'huy il raconte cecy avec grand contentement, et rememore bien à\r\npropos comme Dieu a misericordieusement en cela fait entendre la malice\r\net mensonge de leurs aoutmoins.\r\n\r\nJe raconteray icy un autre faict du mesme Sieur de Potrincourt, et\r\nqui a beaucoup proffité à toute cette gentilité. Un sauvage chrestien\r\nestoit mort, et (marque de sa constance) il avoit mandé icy à\r\nl'habitation, pendant sa maladie, qu'il se recommandoit aux prieres.\r\nAprès sa mort, les autres Sauvages se preparoient de l'enterrer à leur\r\nmode: leur mode est qu'ils prennent tout ce qui appartient au defunct,\r\npeaux, arcs, utensiles, cabannes, etc. bruslent tout cela, hurlants,\r\nbrayants avec certains clameurs, sorceleries et invocations du malin\r\nesprit. M. de Potrincourt delibera de vertueusement resister à ces\r\nceremonies. Il met donc en armes toutes ses gens, et [29] s'en va\r\naux Sauvages en main forte, obtient par ce moyen ce qu'il demandoit,\r\nsçavoir est que le corps fust donné à M. le Patriarche, et ainsi\r\nl'enterrement fut faict à la chrestienne. Cet acte, d'autant qu'il n'a\r\npû estre contrarié par les Sauvages, a esté loué par eux, et l'est\r\nencores.\r\n\r\nLa chappelle qu'on a eue jusque à maintenant, est fort petite, pirement\r\naccomodée, et en toutes façons incommode à tous exercices de religion.\r\nPour remede, M. de Potrincourt nous a donné tout un quartier de\r\nson habitation, si nous pouvons le couvrir et accomoder. Seulement\r\nj'adjousteray encore un mot, que plusieurs seront bien ayses et édifiés\r\nd'ouïr.\r\n\r\nAprès mon arrivée icy à Port-Royal, j'ay esté avec M. de Potrincourt\r\njusque aux Etechemins. Là, Dieu voulut que je rencontrasse le jeune du\r\nPont de Sainct Malo, lequel ne sçays comment effarouché,[IX.] avoit\r\npassé toute l'année avec les Sauvages, vivant de mesme qu'eux. C'est un\r\njeune homme d'une grande force d'esprit et de corps, n'y ayant sauvage\r\nqui courre, agisse ou patisse ou parle mieux que luy. Il estoit en\r\ngrandes apprehensions de M. de [30] Potrincourt; mais Dieu me donna\r\ntant de croyance envers luy, que sur ma parole il vint avec moy dans\r\nnostre navire, et, après quelques submissions et debvoir rendu par\r\nluy, la paix fut faite au grand contentement de tous. Au départir,\r\ncomme les canonades bruyèrent, il me pria de luy assigner heure pour\r\nsa confession. Au lendemain matin, luy mesme prevint l'heure, tant il\r\nestoit en ferveur, et se confessa en l'orée de la mer, en la présence\r\nde tous les Sauvages, qui s'émerveilloient d'ainsy le voir à genoux\r\ndevant moy si long temps. Depuis, il communia avec grand exemple, et\r\npuis dire que les larmes m'en vinrent aux yeux, et ne fus pas seul. Le\r\ndiable fut confus de cet acte: aussy pensa-il subitement tout troubler\r\nl'aprés disnée suivante; mais Dieu mercy, par l'équité et bonté de M.\r\nde Potrincourt, le tout a esté remis en son entier.\r\n\r\nVoilà, mon Révérend Pere, le discours de nostre voyage et des choses\r\nsurvenues tant en yceluy que devant celuy, et depuis nostre arrivée à\r\ncette habitation. Reste maintenant à vous dire que la conversion de ce\r\npays à l'Evangile, et de ce peuple à la civilité, n'est pas petite, ni\r\nsans beaucoup de difficultez; car en premier lieu, si nous considerons\r\nle pays, ce n'est qu'une forest, sans autre commodité pour la vie\r\nque celles qu'on apportera de France, et avec le temps on pourroit\r\nretirer du terroir, après qu'on [31] l'aura cultivé. La nation est\r\nsauvage, vagabonde, mal habituée, rare et d'assez peu de gens. Elle\r\nest, dis-je, sauvage, courant les bois, sans lettres, sans police, sans\r\nbonnes moeurs; elle est vagabonde, sans aucun arrest, ni des maisons\r\nni de parenté, ni des possessions ni de patrie; elle est mal habituée,\r\ngens extremement paresseux, gourmans, irreligieux, traitres, cruels\r\nen vengeance, et adonnés à toute luxure, hommes et femmes, les hommes\r\nayant plusieurs femmes et les abandonnant à autruy, et les femmes ne\r\nleur servant que d'esclaves qu'ils battent et assomment de coups, sans\r\nqu'elles osent se plaindre; et après avoir esté demy meurtries, s'il\r\nplaist au meurtrier, il faut qu'elles rient et luy fassent caresses.\r\n\r\nAvec tous ces maux, ils sont extrêmement glorieux: ils s'estiment\r\nplus vaillans, que nous, meilleurs que nous, plus ingenieux que nous,\r\net, chose difficile à croire, plus riches que nous. Ils s'estiment,\r\ndis-je, plus vaillants que nous, se vantant qu'ils ont tué des Basques\r\net Malouins, et fait beaucoup de mal aux navires, sans que jamays on\r\nen ait tiré vengeance, voulant dire que ce a esté faute de coeur.\r\nIls s'estiment meilleurs: \"Car, disent-ils, vous ne cessez de vous\r\nentrebattre et quereller l'un l'autre; nous vivons en paix. Vous\r\nestes envieux les uns des autres, et détractez les uns des autres\r\nordinairement; [32] vous estes larrons et trompeurs; vous estes\r\nconvoiteux, sans liberalité et misericorde: quant à nous, si nous avons\r\nun morceau du pain, nous le partissons entre nous.\"\r\n\r\nTelles et semblables choses disent-ils communement, voyant les\r\nsusdictes imperfections en quelques-uns de nos gens; et, se flattent\r\nde ce que quelques-uns d'entre eux ne les ont si éminentes, ne\r\nconsiderant (pas) qu'ils ont tous des vices beaucoup plus énormes, et\r\nque la meilleure part des nostres n'ont pas mesmes les vices susdicts,\r\nconcluent universellement qu'ils vallent mieux que tous les chrestiens.\r\nC'est l'amour propre qui les aveugle, et le malin esprit qui les\r\nseduit, ne plus ne moins que vous voyez en nostre France les desvoyés\r\nde la foy s'estimer et se vanter estre meilleurs que les catholiques,\r\nd'autant qu'en quelques-uns ils voyent beaucoup de vices, ne regardants\r\nni les vertus des autres catholiques, ni leurs vices beaucoup plus\r\ngrands; ne voulant, comme Cyclopes, avoir, qu'un seul oeil, et celuy\r\nfiché sur aucuns vices de quelques catholiques, et jamays sur les\r\nvertus des autres, ni sur eux, sinon pour se tromper.\r\n\r\nIls s'estiment aussi plus ingenieux, d'autant qu'ils nous voyent\r\nadmirer aucunes de leurs manufactures, comme oeuvres de personnes si\r\nrudes et grossieres, [33] et admirent peu ce que nous leur monstrons,\r\nquoy que beaucoup plus digne d'estre admiré, faute d'esprit. De là\r\nvient qu'ils s'estiment beaucoup plus riches que nous, quoy qu'ils\r\nsoyent extremement pauvres et souffreteux.\r\n\r\nCacagous, duquel j'ai cy-devant parlé, a bonne grace, quand il a un\r\npeu haussé le ton; car pour monstrer sa bonne affection envers les\r\nFrançoys, il se vante de vouloir aller veoir le Roy, et luy porter un\r\npresent de cent castors, et fait estat, ce faisant, de le faire le plus\r\nriche de tous ses predecesseurs. La cause aussy de ce jugement leur\r\nvient de l'extreme et bruslante convoitise de leurs castors qu'ils\r\nvoyent regner en quelques-uns des nostres.\r\n\r\nNon moins plaisant est le discours d'un certain Sagamo, qui ayant ouy\r\nraconter de M. de Potrincourt, que le Roy estoit jeune et à marier:\r\n\"Peut-estre, dit-il, luy pourray-je donner ma fille pour femme; mais,\r\nselon les us et coustumes du pays, il faudroit que le Roy lui fist de\r\ngrands presens: sçavoir, quatre ou cinq barriques de pain, trois de\r\npois ou de febves, un de petun, quatre ou cinq chapots de cent sols\r\npièce, avec quelques arcs, flesches, harpons, et semblables denrées.\"\r\n\r\nVoylà les marques de l'esprit de cette nation, qui est fort peu\r\npeuplée, principalement les Soriquois et Etechemins qui avoysinent\r\nla mer, combien, que [34] Membertou assure qu'en sa jeunesse il a\r\nveu _chimonuts_, c'est-à-dire des Sauvages aussi dru semés que les\r\ncheveux de la teste. On tient qu'ils sont ainsi diminués depuis que\r\nles François ont commencé à y hanter: car, depuis ce temps-là, ils ne\r\nfont tout l'esté que manger; d'où vient que, prenant une tout autre\r\nhabitude, et amassant de humeurs, l'automne et l'hyver ils payent\r\nleurs intemperies par pleurésies, esquinances, flux de sang, qui les\r\nfont mourir. Seulement cette année, soixante en sont morts au Cap de\r\nla Hève, qui est la plus grande partie de ce qu'ils y estoient; et\r\nneantmoins personne du petit peuple de M. de Potrincourt n'a esté\r\nseulement malade, nonobstant toute l'indigence qu'ils ont paty; ce qui\r\na faict apprehender les Sauvages que Dieu nous deffend et protége comme\r\nson peuple particulier et bien-aymé.\r\n\r\nCe que je dis de cette rareté d'habitants de cette contrée, se doict\r\nentendre de ceux qui paroissent en la coste de la mer; car, dans les\r\nterres, principalement des Etechemins, il y a force peuple, à ce qu'on\r\ndit. Toutes ces choses conjoinctes avec la difficulté du langage, le\r\ntemps qu'il y faudra consommer, les despends qu'il y faudra faire,\r\nles grandes incommoditez et labeurs et disettes qu'il faudra endurer,\r\ndeclarent assez la grandeur de cette entreprise, et les difficultés qui\r\nla pourront traverser. Toutes [35] fois plusieurs choses m'encouragent\r\nà la poursuite d'icelle.\r\n\r\nPremierement l'esperance que j'ay en la bonté et providence de Dieu.\r\nEsaïe nous assure que le royaume de nostre Redempteur doict estre\r\nrecognu par toute la terre, et qu'il ne doict avoir ni antres de\r\ndragons, ni cavernes de basilisques, ni rochers inaccessibles, ni\r\nabysmes tant profonds que son humanité n'adoucisse, son salut ne\r\nguerisse, son abondance ne fertilise, son humilité ne surhausse,\r\net enfin que sa croix ne triomphe victorieusement. Et pour quoy\r\nn'esperay-je que le temps est venu auquel cette prophetie doict estre\r\naccomplie en ces quartiers? Que si cela est, qu'y a-t-il de tant\r\ndifficile que nostre Dieu ne puisse faciliter?\r\n\r\nEn second lieu, je mets la consideration du Roy nostre Sire. C'est\r\nun Roy qui nous promet rien de moindre que le feu Roy son pere\r\nl'incomparable Henri le Grand. Cet oeuvre a commencé avec son reigne,\r\net peut on dire que depuis cent années la France s'est approprié ce\r\npays, ou en a si veritablement pris possession, ny tant faict, que\r\ndepuis son reigne, que Dieu remplisse de toutes benedictions. Il ne\r\nvoudra permettre que son nom et ses armes paroissent en ces regions\r\navec le paganisme, son authorité avec la barbarie, sa renommée avec la\r\nsauvagine, son pouvoir avec l'indigence, [36] sa foy avec manquement,\r\nses subjects sans ayde ni secours. Sa mère aussy, une autre Reyne\r\nBlanche, visant à la gloire de Dieu, contemplera ces deserts et\r\nnouveliers siens, où, au commencement de sa Regence, le coutre de\r\nl'Evangile a par son moyen ouvert quelque esperance de moisson, et se\r\nsouviendra de ce que le feu Roy, grand de sagesse aussi bien que de\r\nvaleur, prononça au Sieur de Potrincourt venant en ce pays: \"Allez,\r\ndit-il, je trace l'édifice; mon fils le bastira.\" Ce que nous supplions\r\nvostre Reverence de luy representer, et ensemble le bon oeuvre que\r\nleurs Majestés peuvent faire en ces quartiers, si c'estoit leur bon\r\nplaysir de fonder et donner quelque honneste revenu à cette residence,\r\nde laquelle se pourroit s'epandre par toute cette contrée ceux qui y\r\nseroyent eslevés et entretenus.\r\n\r\nVoylà le second fondement de nostre esperance, auquel j'adjousteray\r\nla pieté et largesse que nous avons experimenté sur nostre depart\r\nès-seigneurs et dames de cette tres-noble et tres-chrestienne cour,\r\nme promettant qu'ils ne voudront manquer de favoriser de leurs moyens\r\ncette entreprise, pour ne perdre ce que desjà ils y ont employé, ce qui\r\nleur sert d'ares de gloire et de felicité immortelle devant Dieu.\r\n\r\nM. de Potrincourt, Seigneur doux et équitable, [37] vaillant, amé et\r\nexperimenté en ces quartiers, et M. de Biancourt son fils, imitateur\r\ndes vertus et belles qualitez de son pere, tous deux zelés au service\r\nde Dieu, qui nous honorent et cherissent plus que nous ne meritons,\r\nnous donnent aussi grand courage de nous employer en ceste ouvrage de\r\ntout nostre pouvoir.\r\n\r\nFinalement, l'assiete et condition de ce lieu, qui promet beaucoup pour\r\nl'usage de la vie humaine, s'il est cultivé, et sa beauté, qui me fait\r\nesmerveiller de ce qu'il a esté si peu recherché jusques à maintenant,\r\noù est ce port où nous sommes, fort propre pour d'icy nous estendre\r\naux Armouchiquois, Iroquois et Montagnes, nos voisins, qui sont grands\r\npeuples, et labourent les terres comme nous; ce lieu, dis-je, nous fait\r\nesperer quelque chose à l'advenir. Que si nos Souriquois sont peu, ils\r\nse peuvent peupler; s'ils sont sauvages, c'est pour les domestiquer\r\net civiliser qu'on vient icy; s'ils sont rudes; nous ne devons point\r\nestre pour cela paresseux; s'ils ont jusqu'ici peu profité, ce n'est\r\nmerveille, ce seroit rigueur d'exiger si tost fruict d'un gref, et\r\ndemander sens et barbe d'un enfant.\r\n\r\nPour conclusion, nous esperons avec le temps les rendre susceptible de\r\nla doctrine de la foy et religion chrestienne et catholique, et après,\r\npasser [38] plus avant aux regions de deçà plus habitées et cultivées,\r\ncomme dict est; esperance que nous appuyons sur la bonté et misericorde\r\nde Dieu, sur le zele et fervente charité de tous les gens de bien qui\r\naffectueusement desirent le royaume de Dieu, particulierement sur les\r\nsainctes prieres de Vostre Reverence et de nos RR. PP. et très-chers\r\nFF. auxquels très-affectueusement nous nous recommandons.\r\n\r\nDu Port-Royal en la Nouvelle-France, ce dixiesme juin mil six cents\r\nonze.\r\n\r\n  PIERRE BIARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n[III.] Charles de Biencourt, écuyer, sieur de Saint-Just et fils de\r\nM. de Poutrincourt.

By the mercy of God,\r\nand through the prayers of Your Reverence and of our good Fathers\r\nand Brothers, here we are at the end of our journey and in the\r\nlong-wished-for place. And I am now taking the first opportunity which\r\npresents itself to write to Your Reverence, and to communicate to you\r\nnews of ourselves and of our present situation. I am sorry that the\r\nshort time we have been in this country does not permit me to write\r\nabout it at length, as I was desirous [10] of doing, and about the\r\ncondition of these poor people; however, I will try to describe to you\r\nnot only what happened in our voyage, but also all that we have been\r\nable to learn of these peoples since our arrival, as I believe all our\r\ngood noblemen and friends, as well as Your Reverence, expect and desire\r\nme to do.\r\n\r\nSo, to begin with the preparations for our voyage, Your Reverence\r\nmust know about the effort put forth by two Dieppe merchants of the\r\npretended religion, who were charged with freighting the ship, to\r\nprevent our being received upon it. For a number of years past, those\r\nwho began and continued to make voyages to Canada have wished some of\r\nour Society to be employed for the conversion of the people of that\r\ncountry; and Henry the Great, the late King, of happy memory, had set\r\naside five hundred écus[34] for the voyage of the first ones who should\r\nbe sent there: at this time Reverend Father Enmond Masse and I, chosen\r\nfor this mission, after having saluted the Queen Regent and learned\r\nfrom her own utterances the holy zeal which she felt for the conversion\r\nof this barbarous people, and having received the above-mentioned five\r\nhundred écus for our viaticum,[35] aided also by the pious liberality\r\nof the Marchionesses de Guercheville, Verneuil, and de Sourdis,[36]\r\nleft Paris and arrived at Dieppe upon the day which [11] Monsieur de\r\nBiancourt, son of Monsieur de Potrincourt, had designated for our\r\ndeparture, the 27th of October, 1610.\r\n\r\nThe two above-mentioned merchants, as soon as they heard that two\r\nJesuits were going to Canada, addressed themselves to Monsieur de\r\nBiancourt[X.] and warned him that, if the said Jesuits intended to\r\nembark upon the ship, they would have nothing to do with it: they were\r\ntold that the presence of the Jesuits would in no wise interfere with\r\nthem; that, thanks to God and the Queen, they had the money to pay\r\ntheir passage without in the least disturbing their cargo. They still\r\npersisted, however, in their refusal; and although Monsieur de Sicoine,\r\ngovernor of the city, a very zealous catholic, kindly interposed, he\r\ncould gain nothing from them. For this reason, Monsieur Robbin,[XI.]\r\nhis son, otherwise called de Coloigne,[37] a partner of Monsieur de\r\nBiancourt in this voyage, thought he would go to Court and make known\r\nthis difficulty to the Queen; he did so. The Queen, thereupon, sent\r\nletters addressed to Monsieur de Sicoigne, telling him to announce that\r\nthe will of the present King, as well as [12] that of the late King of\r\neternal memory, was that these Jesuits should go to Canada; and that\r\nthose who were opposing their departure were doing so against the will\r\nof their Prince. The letters were very kind: and Monsieur de Sicoigne\r\nwas pleased to assemble the consistory, and read them to that body.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, the merchants would not yield in the least;\r\nit was merely granted that, leaving the Jesuits out of the question,\r\nthey should promptly load their ship, lest these perplexities and\r\ndisputes should cause some delay in bringing the succor to Monsieur de\r\nPotrincourt, which must be given promptly. Then I almost made up my\r\nmind that all our hopes were doomed to disappointment, for I did not\r\nsee how we were to be extricated from these difficulties. Monsieur de\r\nColoigne did not despair; but, showing himself in his kindness always\r\nmore eager to pursue the case for us, by a second journey he convinced\r\nthe Court of an excellent plan for thwarting the merchants; namely, by\r\npaying them for their cargo, and thus indemnifying them. Madame de\r\nla Guercheville, a lady of great virtue, recognizing the expediency of\r\nthis plan, and deeming it inconsistent with real piety to allow a godly\r\nwork to be checked for such a trifle, and thus [13] that satan should\r\nbe permitted to triumph, determined to try and raise the sum of money\r\nrequired; and she did so with such diligence and success, through the\r\npious generosity of several Noblemen and Ladies of the court, that she\r\nsoon collected four thousand livres and sent them to Dieppe. Thus the\r\nmerchants were deprived of all the rights which they might have had in\r\nthe vessel, without losing anything, and we were admitted into it.\r\n\r\nThis, and other incidents interfering with the preparations for our\r\nvoyage, were the reasons why we could not leave Dieppe before the 26th\r\nof January, 1611. Monsieur de Biancourt, a very accomplished young\r\ngentleman, and well versed in matters pertaining to the sea, was our\r\nleader and commander. There were thirty-six of us in the ship, which\r\nwas called _la Grace de Dieu_, of about sixty tons burden. We had\r\nonly two days of favorable winds; on the third day we suddenly found\r\nourselves carried, by contrary winds and tides, to within a hundred or\r\ntwo hundred paces of the breakers of the isle of Wight, in England;\r\nand it was fortunate for us that we found good anchorage there, for\r\notherwise we certainly should have been lost.\r\n\r\nLeaving this place we put into port at Hyrmice, and then at Newport; by\r\nwhich we lost eighteen days. The 16th of February, first day of lent,\r\n[14] a good northwester arising allowed us to depart, and accompanied\r\nus out of the English Channel. Now mariners, in coming to Port Royal,\r\nare not accustomed to take the direct route from the Ouessant islands\r\nto Cape Sable, which would lessen the distance, for in this way, from\r\nDieppe to Port Royal, there would only be about one thousand leagues;\r\nbut they are in the habit of going South as far as the Azores, and from\r\nthere to the great bank, thence, according to the winds, to strike for\r\nCape Sable, or Campseaux, or elsewhere. They have told me that they go\r\nby way of the Azores for three reasons: first, in order to avoid the\r\nnorth sea, which is very stormy, they say; second, to make use of the\r\nsouth winds, which usually prevail there; third, to be sure of their\r\nreckonings; for otherwise it is difficult to take their bearings and\r\narrange their route without error. But none of these causes affected\r\nus, although we followed this custom. Not the first, for we were so\r\ntossed about by tempests and high seas, that I do not think we gained\r\nmuch by going north or south, south or north; nor the second, because\r\noften when we wanted the South, the North wind blew, and vice versa;\r\nand certainly not the third, inasmuch as we could not even see the\r\nAzores, although we went [15] down as far as 39° 30'. Thus all the\r\ncalculations of our leaders were confounded, and we had not yet reached\r\nthe Azores of the great bank when some of them thought we had passed\r\nit.[38]\r\n\r\nThe great codfish bank is not, as I thought in France, a kind of sand\r\nor mud-bank, appearing above the surface of the sea; but is a great\r\nsub-marine plateau 35, 40 and 45 fathoms deep, and in some places\r\ntwenty-five leagues in extent. They call it bank, because, in coming\r\nfrom the deep sea, it is the first place where bottom is found with the\r\nsounding lead. Now upon the border of this great bank, for the space of\r\nthree or four leagues, the waves are generally very high, and these\r\nthree or four leagues are called the Azores.\r\n\r\nWe were near these Azores on Tuesday of Easter week, when suddenly we\r\nbecame a prey to our sworn foe, the West wind, which was so violent and\r\nobstinate that we very nearly perished. For eight entire days it gave\r\nus no quarter, its vindictiveness being augmented by cold and sometimes\r\nrain or snow.\r\n\r\nIn taking this route to New France, so rough and dangerous, especially\r\nin small and badly-equipped boats, one experiences the sum total of all\r\nthe miseries of life. We could rest neither [16] day nor night. When we\r\nwished to eat, a dish suddenly slipped from us and struck somebody's\r\nhead. We fell over each other and against the baggage, and thus found\r\nourselves mixed up with others who had been upset in the same way;\r\ncups were spilled over our beds, and bowls in our laps, or a big wave\r\ndemanded our plates.\r\n\r\nI was so highly honored by Monsieur de Biancourt as to share his cabin.\r\nOne fine night, as we were lying in bed, trying to get a little rest,\r\na neat and impudent wave bent our window fastenings, broke the window,\r\nand covered us over completely; we had the same experience again,\r\nduring the day. Furthermore, the cold was so severe, and continued to\r\nbe for more than six weeks, that we lost nearly all sensation from\r\nnumbness and exposure. Good Father Masse suffered a great deal.[39] He\r\nwas ill about forty days, eating very little and seldom leaving his\r\nbed; yet, notwithstanding all that, he wanted to fast. After Easter he\r\ncontinued to improve, thank God, more and more. As for me, I was gay\r\nand happy, and, by the grace of God, was never ill enough to stay in\r\nbed even when several of the sailors had to give up.\r\n\r\nAfter escaping from these trials, we entered the ice at the Azores\r\nof the bank, 46 degrees north latitude. Some of these masses of ice\r\nseemed like islands, others [17] little villages, others grand churches\r\nor lofty domes, or magnificent castles: all were floating. To avoid\r\nthem we steered towards the south; but this was falling, as they say,\r\nfrom Charybdis into Scylla, for from these high rocks we fell into a\r\nlevel field of low ice, with which the sea was entirely covered, as\r\nfar as the eye could reach. We did not know how to steer through it;\r\nand had it not been for the fearlessness of Monsieur de Biancourt, our\r\nsailors would have been helpless; but he guided us out, notwithstanding\r\nthe protests of many of them, through a place where the ice was more\r\nscattered, and God, in his goodness, assisted us.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May, we disembarked at Campceau,[40] and there had the\r\nopportunity of celebrating holy mass after so long a time, and of\r\nstrengthening ourselves with that bread which never fails to nourish\r\nand console. Then we coasted along until we reached Port Royal, where\r\nwe arrived under good and happy auspices early in the morning[41] of\r\nthe holy day of Pentecost, the 22nd of May,[XII.] the day upon which\r\nthe sun enters the constellation Gemini. Our voyage had lasted four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe joy of Monsieur de Potrincourt and his followers, at our arrival,\r\nis indescribable. They had been, during the entire winter, reduced [18]\r\nto sore straits, as I am going to explain to you.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Potrincourt had accompanied his son a part of the way\r\nupon the latter's return to France the last of July, 1610, and had\r\ngone as far as port Saint John,[XIII.] otherwise called Chachippé,[42]\r\n70 leagues east and south of Port Royal. When he was returning, as\r\nhe veered around Cape Sable, he found himself in a strong current;\r\nweakened by hardships, he was obliged to yield the helm, in order to\r\ntake a little rest, commanding his successor to always keep near the\r\nshore, even in the deepest part of the Bay. This pilot, I know not why,\r\ndid not follow his orders, but soon afterward changed his course and\r\nleft the shore.\r\n\r\nThe Savage, Membertou, who was following in his boat, was astonished\r\nthat Poutrincourt should take this route; but, not knowing why he did\r\nso, neither followed him nor said anything about it. So he soon arrived\r\nat Port Royal, while Monsieur de Potrincourt drifted about for six\r\nweeks, in danger of being hopelessly lost; for this worthy gentleman,\r\nwhen he awoke, was very much surprised at seeing himself in a small\r\nboat in the open sea, out of sight of land. He looked at his dial in\r\nvain, for not knowing [19] what route his amiable pilot had taken, he\r\ncould not guess where he was, nor in what direction to turn. Another\r\nmisfortune was that his boat would not sail on a bowline,[XIV.] having\r\nbeen somehow damaged in the sides. So, whether he wished to do so or\r\nnot, he was always obliged to sail before the wind.\r\n\r\nA third inconvenience and misfortune was a lack of food. However, he\r\nis a man who does not easily give up, and good luck follows him. Now\r\nin this perplexity about the route, he fortunately decided to turn to\r\nthe north, and God sent him what he desired, a favorable South wind.\r\nHis thrift served him against the misfortune of hunger, for he had\r\nhunted and kept a certain number of cormorants.[XV.] But how could they\r\nbe roasted in a small boat, so as to be eaten and kept? Fortunately\r\nhe found he had a few planks, upon which he built a fire-place, and\r\nthus roasted the game; by the aid of which he arrived at Pentegouët,\r\nformerly Norembegue, and from there to the Etechemins, thence to the\r\nharbor of Port Royal, where by a piece of ill luck, he was nearly\r\nshipwrecked.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when he entered this harbor, and his crew began to oppose\r\nhim, stoutly denying [20] that they were in the harbor of Port Royal.\r\nHe was willing to listen to their objections, and unfortunately even\r\nyielded to them; and so turning to the lower part of French Bay, he\r\nwent wandering away off at the mercy of the winds and waves. Meanwhile\r\nthe colonists of Port Royal were in great anxiety and had already\r\nnearly made up their minds that he was lost; the savage, Membertou,\r\nstrengthened this fear by asserting that he had seen him sail out of\r\nsight upon the sea; whence it was inferred, since people believe as\r\neasily what they fear as what they favor, that as such and such a wind\r\nhad prevailed, it was impossible for them to escape in such a boat.\r\nAnd they were already planning their return to France. Now they were\r\ngreatly astonished, and at the same time exceedingly happy when they\r\nsaw their Theseus return from another world; this was six weeks after\r\nhis departure, just when Monsieur de Biancourt arrived in France,\r\nwhose return was expected at Port Royal during the whole month of\r\nNovember of the same year, 1610. But they were very much surprised\r\nwhen they did not see him at Christmas; then they lost all hope, on\r\naccount of the winter weather, of seeing him again before the end of\r\nthe following April.\r\n\r\nFor this reason they cut down their rations; but such economy was\r\nof little avail, since Sieur de Potrincourt did not lessen [21] his\r\nliberality toward the Savages, fearing to alienate them from the\r\nChristian faith. He is truly a liberal and magnanimous gentleman,\r\nrefusing all recompense for the good he does them; so when they are\r\noccasionally asked why they do not give him something in return for so\r\nmany favors, they are accustomed to answer, cunningly: _Endries ninan\r\nmetaij Sagamo_, that is to say, \"Monsieur does not care for our beaver\r\nskins.\" Nevertheless, they have now and then sent him some pieces of\r\nelk meat, which have helped him to gain time [i.e., to save his own\r\nprovisions]. But they, the French, had a good chance of economizing\r\nwhen winter came, for their mill froze up, and they had no way of\r\nmaking flour. Happily for them they found a store of peas and beans,\r\nwhich proved to be their manna and ambrosia for seven weeks.\r\n\r\nThen April came, but not the ship; now it was just as well that the\r\nmill was frozen up, for they had nothing to put in the hopper. What\r\nwere they to do? Hunger is a bad complaint. Some began to fish, others\r\nto dig. From their fishing they obtained some smelts and herrings; from\r\ntheir digging some very good roots, called _chiqueli_, which are very\r\nabundant in certain places.\r\n\r\nThus this importunate creditor was somewhat satisfied; I say somewhat,\r\nbecause, when there was no bread, [22] everything else was of little\r\naccount; and they had already made up their minds that, if the ship did\r\nnot come during the month of May, they would resort to the coast, in\r\nsearch of ships to take them back to the sweet land of wheat and vines.\r\nIt was Monsieur de Potrincourt's followers who talked this way; as for\r\nhim, he was full of courage and knew well how he could manage to hold\r\nout until saint John's day [midsummer]. Thank God, there was no need of\r\nthis, for, as has been said, we arrived the 22nd of May. Those who know\r\nwhat hunger, despair, fear and suffering are, what it is to be a leader\r\nand see all one's enterprises and hard work come to nought, can imagine\r\nwhat must have been the joy of Monsieur de Potrincourt and his colony\r\nupon seeing us arrive.\r\n\r\nWe all wept at this meeting, which seemed almost like a dream; then\r\nwhen we had recovered ourselves a little and had begun to talk, this\r\nquestion (mine, in fact) was proposed, to wit: Which was the happier\r\nof the two, Monsieur de Potrincourt and his people, or Monsieur de\r\nBiancourt and his? Truly, our hearts swelled within us, and God, in his\r\nmercy, showed that he took pleasure in our joy; for, after mass and\r\ndinner, there was nothing but going and coming from the ship to the\r\nsettlement, and from the settlement to the [23] ship, each one wanting\r\nto embrace and be embraced by his friends, just as, after the winter,\r\nwe rejoice in the beautiful spring, and after a siege, in our freedom.\r\nIt happened that two persons from the settlement took one of the canoes\r\nof the savages to go to the ship. These canoes are so made that, if you\r\ndo not sit very straight and steady, they immediately tip over; now\r\nit chanced that, wishing to come back in the same canoe from the ship\r\nto the settlement, somehow they did not properly balance it, and both\r\nfell into the water.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it occurred at a time when I happened to be walking upon\r\nthe shore with Monsieur de Potrincourt. Seeing the accident, we made\r\nsigns with our hats as best we could to those upon the ship to come to\r\ntheir aid; for it would have been useless to call out, so far away was\r\nthe ship, and so loud the noise of the wind. At first no one paid any\r\nattention to us, so we had recourse to prayer, and fell upon our knees,\r\nthis being our only alternative; and God had pity upon us. One of the\r\ntwo caught hold of the canoe, which was turned upside down, and threw\r\nhimself upon it: the other was finally saved by a boat, and thus both\r\nwere rescued; so our cup of joy was full in seeing how God in his all\r\npaternal love and gentleness, would not permit the evil one to trouble\r\nus and to destroy our happiness upon this good day. To him be the glory\r\nforever. Amen!\r\n\r\n[24] But now that we have arrived in good health, by the grace of God,\r\nit is time we were casting our eyes over the country, and were giving\r\nsome consideration to the condition in which we find christianity here.\r\nIts whole foundation consists, after God, in this little settlement\r\nof a family of about twenty persons. Messire Jessé Flesche, commonly\r\ncalled the Patriarch, has had charge of it; and, in the year that he\r\nhas lived here, has baptized about one hundred Savages. The trouble is,\r\nhe has not been able to instruct them as he would have wished, because\r\nhe did not know the language, and had nothing with which to support\r\nthem; for he who would minister to their souls, must at the same\r\ntime resolve to nourish their bodies. This worthy man has shown great\r\nfriendliness toward us, and thanked God for our coming; for he had made\r\nup his mind some time ago to return to France at the first opportunity,\r\nwhich he is now quite free to do without regret at leaving a vine which\r\nhe has planted.\r\n\r\nThey have not yet succeeded in translating into the native language the\r\ncommon creed or symbol, the Lord's prayer, the commandments of God, the\r\nSacraments, and other principles quite necessary to the making of a\r\nchristian.\r\n\r\nRecently, when I was at port Saint John, I was informed that among the\r\nother Savages there were five who were already christians. Thereupon\r\nI took occasion to give them [25] some pictures, and to erect a cross\r\nbefore their wigwams, singing a _Salve Regina_. I had them make the\r\nsign of the cross; but I was very much astonished, for the unbaptized\r\nunderstood almost as much about it as the christians. I asked each one\r\nhis baptismal name; some did not know theirs, so they called themselves\r\n_Patriarchs_, because it is the Patriarch who gives them their names,\r\nand thus they conclude that, when they have forgotten their own names,\r\nthey ought to be called _Patriarchs_.\r\n\r\nIt was also rather amusing that, when I asked them if they were\r\nchristians, they did not know what I meant; when I asked them if\r\nthey had been baptized, they answered: _Hetaion enderquir Vortmandia\r\nPatriarché_, that is to say, \"Yes, the Patriarch has made us like\r\nthe Normans.\" Now they call all the French \"Normans,\" except the\r\nMalouins,[43] whom they call Samaricois, and the Basques, Bascua.\r\n\r\nThe name of the _sagamore_, that is, the lord of port Saint John, is\r\nCacagous, a man who is shrewd and cunning as are no others upon the\r\ncoast; that is all that he brought back from France (for he has been in\r\nFrance); he told me he had been baptized in Bayonne, relating his story\r\nto me as one tells about going to a ball out of friendship. Whereupon,\r\nseeing how wicked he was, and [26] wishing to try and arouse his\r\nconscience, I asked him how many wives he had. He answered that he had\r\neight; and in fact he counted off seven to me who were there present,\r\npointing them out with as much pride, instead of an equal degree of\r\nshame, as if I had asked him the number of his legitimate children.\r\n\r\nAnother, who was looking out for a number of wives, made the following\r\nanswer to my objections on the ground that he was a Christian: _Reroure\r\nquiro Nortmandia_: which means, \"That is all well enough for you\r\nNormans.\" So there is scarcely any change in them after their baptism.\r\nThe same savagery and the same manners, or but little different, the\r\nsame customs, ceremonies, usages, fashions, and vices remain, at least\r\nas far as can be learned; no attention being paid to any distinction of\r\ntime, days, offices, exercises, prayers, duties, virtues, or spiritual\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nMembertou, as the one who has most associated with Monsieur de\r\nPotrincourt for a long time, is also the most zealous and shows the\r\ngreatest faith, but even he complains of not understanding us well\r\nenough; he would like to become a preacher, he says, if he were\r\nproperly taught. He gave me a witty answer the other day, as I was\r\nteaching him his _Pater_, according to the translation made of it by M.\r\nde Biancourt, when [27] I had him say: _Nui en caraco nac iquem esmoi\r\nciscou_; that is, \"Give us this day our daily bread.\" \"But,\" said he,\r\n\"if I did not ask him for anything but bread, I would be without\r\nmoose-meat or fish.\"\r\n\r\nThe good old man told us, with a great deal of feeling, how God is\r\nhelping him since he has become a Christian, saying that this spring\r\nit happened that he and his family were suffering much from hunger;\r\nthen he remembered that he was a christian, and therefore prayed to\r\nGod. After his prayer, he went to the river and found all the smelts he\r\nwanted. And while I am speaking of this old sagamore, the first fruit\r\nof this heathen nation, I will tell you also what happened this winter.\r\n\r\nHe was sick, and what is more, had been given up to die by the native\r\n_aoutmoins_, or sorcerers. Now it is the custom, when the Aoutmoins\r\nhave pronounced the malady or wound to be mortal, for the sick man to\r\ncease eating from that time on, nor do they give him anything more.\r\nBut, donning his beautiful robe, he begins chanting his own death-song;\r\nafter this, if he lingers too long, a great many pails of water are\r\nthrown over him to hasten his death, and sometimes he is buried half\r\nalive. Now the children of Membertou, though christians, were prepared\r\nto exercise this noble and pious duty toward their father; already\r\nthey had ceased giving him anything to eat and had taken away his [28]\r\nbeautiful otter robe, and he had, like the swan, finished his Nænie,\r\nor funeral chant. One thing still troubled him, that he did not know\r\nhow to die like a christian, and he had not taken farewell of Monsieur\r\nde Potrincourt. When M. de Potrincourt heard these things, he went to\r\nsee him, remonstrated with him, and assured him that, in spite of all\r\nthe Aoutmoins and Pilotois, he would live and recover his health if he\r\nwould eat something, which he was bound to do, being a christian. The\r\ngood man believed and was saved; to-day he tells this story with great\r\nsatisfaction, and very aptly points out how God has thereby mercifully\r\nexposed the malice and deceit of their aoutmoins.\r\n\r\nI shall here relate another act of the same Sieur de Potrincourt, which\r\nhas been of great benefit to all these heathen. A christian savage had\r\ndied, and (as a mark of his constancy) he had sent word here to the\r\nsettlement during his sickness, that he desired our prayers. After his\r\ndeath the other Savages prepared to bury him in their way; they are\r\naccustomed to take everything that belongs to the deceased, skins,\r\nbows, utensils, wigwams, etc., and burn them all, howling and shouting\r\ncertain cries, sorceries, and invocations to the evil spirit. M. de\r\nPotrincourt firmly resolved to oppose these ceremonies. So he armed all\r\nhis men, and [29] going to the Savages in force, by this means obtained\r\nwhat he asked, namely, that the body should be given to the Patriarch,\r\nand so the burial took place according to christian customs. This act,\r\ninasmuch as it could not be prevented by the Savages, was and still is,\r\ngreatly praised by them.\r\n\r\nThe chapel they have been using until now is very small, badly\r\narranged, and in every way unsuited for religious services. To remedy\r\nthis, M. de Poutrincourt has given us an entire quarter of his\r\nhabitation, if we can roof it over and adapt it to our needs. But I\r\nshall add one more word which will be pleasant and edifying news to\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nAfter my arrival here at Port Royal, I went with M. de Potrincourt as\r\nfar as the Etechemins. There God willed that I should meet young du\r\nPont, of Sainct Malo,[44] who, having been for some reason frightened\r\naway [from the settlement],[XVI.] had passed the entire year with the\r\nSavages, living just as they did. He is a young man of great physical\r\nand mental strength, excelled by none of the savages in the chase, in\r\nalertness and endurance, and in his ability to speak their language.\r\nHe was very much afraid of M. de [30] Potrincourt: but God inspired me\r\nwith so much faith in him that, relying upon my word, Du Pont came with\r\nme to our ship; and after making some apologies and promises, peace was\r\ndeclared, to the great satisfaction of all. When he departed, as the\r\ncannon were sounding, he begged me to appoint an hour to receive his\r\nconfession. The next morning, in his great eagerness, he anticipated\r\nthe hour, and made his confession upon the shores of the sea in the\r\npresence of all the Savages, who were greatly astonished at thus\r\nseeing him upon his knees so long before me. Then he took communion in\r\na most exemplary manner, at which I can say tears came into my eyes,\r\nand not into mine alone. The devil was confounded at this act; so he\r\nstraightway planned trouble for us that very afternoon; but thank God,\r\nthrough the justice and goodness of M. de Potrincourt, harmony was\r\neverywhere restored.\r\n\r\nAnd now you have had, my Reverend Father, an account of our voyage,\r\nof what happened in it, and before it, and since our arrival at this\r\nsettlement. It now remains to tell you that the conversion of this\r\ncountry to the Gospel, and of these people to civilization, is not a\r\nsmall undertaking nor free from great difficulties; for, in the first\r\nplace, if we consider the country, it is only a forest, without other\r\nconveniences of life than those which will be brought from France,\r\nand what in time may be obtained from the soil after [31] it has been\r\ncultivated. The nation is savage, wandering and full of bad habits; the\r\npeople few and isolated. They are, I say, savage, haunting the woods,\r\nignorant, lawless and rude: they are wanderers, with nothing to attach\r\nthem to a place, neither homes nor relationship, neither possessions\r\nnor love of country; as a people they have bad habits, are extremely\r\nlazy, gluttonous, profane, treacherous, cruel in their revenge, and\r\ngiven up to all kinds of lewdness, men and women alike, the men having\r\nseveral wives and abandoning them to others, and the women only serving\r\nthem as slaves, whom they strike and beat unmercifully, and who\r\ndare not complain; and after being half killed, if it so please the\r\nmurderer, they must laugh and caress him.\r\n\r\nWith all these vices, they are exceedingly vainglorious: they think\r\nthey are better, more valiant and more ingenious than the French;\r\nand, what is difficult to believe, richer than we are. They consider\r\nthemselves, I say, braver than we are, boasting that they have killed\r\nBasques and Malouins, and that they do a great deal of harm to the\r\nships, and that no one has ever resented it, insinuating that it was\r\nfrom a lack of courage. They consider themselves better than the\r\nFrench; \"For,\" they say, \"you are always fighting and quarreling among\r\nyourselves; we live peaceably. You are envious and are all the time\r\nslandering each other; [32] you are thieves and deceivers; you are\r\ncovetous, and are neither generous nor kind; as for us, if we have a\r\nmorsel of bread we share it with our neighbor.\"\r\n\r\nThey are saying these and like things continually, seeing the\r\nabove-mentioned imperfections in some of us, and flattering themselves\r\nthat some of their own people do not have them so conspicuously, not\r\nrealizing that they all have much greater vices, and that the better\r\npart of our people do not have even these defects, they conclude\r\ngenerally that they are superior to all christians. It is self-love\r\nthat blinds them, and the evil one who leads them on, no more nor\r\nless than in our France, we see those who have deviated from the\r\nfaith holding themselves higher and boasting of being better than the\r\ncatholics, because in some of them they see many faults; considering\r\nneither the virtues of the other catholics, nor their own still greater\r\nimperfections; wishing to have, like Cyclops, only a single eye, and to\r\nfix that one upon the vices of a few catholics, never upon the virtues\r\nof the others, nor upon themselves, unless it be for the purpose of\r\nself-deception.\r\n\r\nAlso they [the savages] consider themselves more ingenious, inasmuch as\r\nthey see us admire some of their productions as the work of people so\r\nrude and ignorant; [33] lacking intelligence, they bestow very little\r\nadmiration upon what we show them, although much more worthy of being\r\nadmired. Hence they regard themselves as much richer than we are,\r\nalthough they are poor and wretched in the extreme.\r\n\r\nCacagous, of whom I have already spoken, is quite gracious when he is\r\na little elated about something; to show his kindly feelings toward\r\nthe French he boasts of his willingness to go and see the King, and to\r\ntake him a present of a hundred beaver skins, proudly suggesting that\r\nin so doing he will make him richer than all his predecessors. They\r\nget this idea from the extreme covetousness and eagerness which our\r\npeople display to obtain their beaver skins.\r\n\r\nNot less amusing is the remark of a certain Sagamore, who, having\r\nheard M. de Potrincourt say that the King was young and unmarried:\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said he, \"I may let him marry my daughter; but according\r\nto the usages and customs of the country, the King must make me some\r\nhandsome presents; namely, four or five barrels of bread, three of peas\r\nor beans, one of tobacco, four or five cloaks worth one hundred sous\r\napiece, bows, arrows, harpoons, and other similar articles.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the marks of intelligence in the people of these countries,\r\nwhich are very sparsely populated, especially those of the Soriquois\r\nand Etechemins, which are near the sea; although [34] Membertou assures\r\nus that in his youth he has seen _chimonuts_, that is to say, Savages,\r\nas thickly planted there as the hairs upon his head. It is maintained\r\nthat they have thus diminished since the French have began to frequent\r\ntheir country; for, since then they do nothing all summer but eat;\r\nand the result is that, adopting an entirely different custom and\r\nthus breeding new diseases, they pay for their indulgence during the\r\nautumn and winter by pleurisy, quinsy and dysentery, which kill them\r\noff. During this year alone sixty have died at Cape de la Hève, which\r\nis the greater part of those who lived there; yet not one of all M.\r\nde Potrincourt's little colony has even been sick, notwithstanding\r\nall the privations they have suffered; which has caused the Savages\r\nto apprehend that God protects and defends us as his favorite and\r\nwell-beloved people.\r\n\r\nWhat I say about the sparseness of the population of these countries\r\nmust be understood as referring to the people who live upon the coast;\r\nfor farther inland, principally among the Etechemins, there are, it is\r\nsaid, a great many people. All these things, added to the difficulty of\r\nacquiring the language, the time that must be consumed, the expenses\r\nthat must be incurred, the great distress, toil and poverty that must\r\nbe endured, fully proclaim the greatness of this enterprise and the\r\ndifficulties which beset it. Yet [35] many things encourage me to\r\ncontinue in it.\r\n\r\nFirst, my trust in the goodness and providence of God. Isaiah assures\r\nus that the kingdom of our Redeemer shall be recognized throughout\r\nthe earth; and that there shall be neither caves of dragons nor dens\r\nof cockatrices, nor inaccessible rocks, nor abysses so deep, that his\r\ngrace will not soften and his salvation cure, his abundance fertilize,\r\nhis humility raise up, and over which his cross will not at last\r\nvictoriously triumph. And why shall I not hope that the time has come\r\nwhen this prophecy is to be fulfilled in these lands? If that be so,\r\nwhat can there be so difficult that our Lord cannot make it easy?\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I rely upon the King, our Sire. He is a Sovereign\r\nwho promises us nothing less than the late King, his father, the\r\nincomparable Henry the Great. This work began in the latter's reign,\r\nand it may be said that in the century since France has appropriated\r\nthis country, or has so completely taken possession of it, there\r\nhas not been so much accomplished at any time as since our present\r\nking became sovereign; may God fill his reign with all blessings. He\r\nwill not permit his name and arms to stand in these regions side by\r\nside with paganism, his authority with barbarism, his renown with\r\nsavagery, his power with poverty, [36] his faith with lack of works,\r\nnor leave his subjects without aid or succor. His mother also, another\r\nQueen Blanche,[45] looking to the glory of God, will contemplate these\r\nlately-acquired wildernesses, where in the beginning of her Regency the\r\nGospel plough has, through her instrumentality, created some hope of a\r\nharvest; and will recall what the late King, great in wisdom as well as\r\nin courage, said to Sieur de Potrincourt when he came to this country:\r\n\"Go,\" said he. \"I plan the edifice; my son will build it.\" We beg your\r\nReverence to lay this matter before him, together with the work which\r\nmight be done by their Majesties in these lands, if it were their good\r\npleasure to endow and to give a fair revenue to this mission, from\r\nwhich all those who would be educated and maintained here might go\r\nforth through the whole country.\r\n\r\nThat is the second resource upon which our hopes are founded; to\r\nwhich I will add the piety and liberality which we experienced upon\r\nour departure from the lords and ladies of this most noble and most\r\nchristian court, who promised me that they would not fail to assist\r\nthis enterprise with their means, in order not to lose what they have\r\nalready invested in it, which serves them as monuments of glory and of\r\neternal happiness before God.\r\n\r\nM. de Potrincourt, a mild and upright Gentleman, [37] brave, beloved\r\nand well-known in these parts, and M. de Biancourt, his son, who\r\nreflects the virtues and good qualities of his father, both zealous in\r\nserving God, and who honor and cherish us more than we deserve, also\r\nencourage us in devoting all our energy to this work.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are encouraged by the situation and condition of this\r\nplace, which, if it is cultivated, promises to furnish a great deal\r\nfor the needs of human life; and its beauty causes me to wonder that\r\nit has been so little sought up to the present time. From this port\r\nwhere we now are, it is very convenient for us to spread out to the\r\nArmouchiquois, Iroquois, and Montagnais, our neighbors, which are\r\npopulous nations and till the soil as we do; this situation, I say,\r\nmakes us hope something for the future. For, if our Souriquois are few,\r\nthey may become numerous; if they are savages, it is to domesticate\r\nand civilize them that we have come here; if they are rude, that is no\r\nreason that we should be idle; if they have until now profited little,\r\nit is no wonder, for it would be too much to expect fruit from this\r\ngrafting, and to demand reason and maturity from a child.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we hope in time to make them susceptible of receiving\r\nthe doctrines of the faith and of the christian and catholic religion,\r\nand later, to penetrate [38] farther into the regions beyond, which\r\nthey say are more populous and better cultivated. We base this hope\r\nupon Divine goodness and mercy, upon the zeal and fervent charity of\r\nall good people who earnestly desire the kingdom of God, particularly\r\nupon the holy prayers of Your Reverence and of our Reverend Fathers and\r\nvery dear Brothers, to whom we most affectionately commend ourselves.\r\n\r\nFrom Port Royal, New France, this tenth day of June, one thousand six\r\nhundred and eleven.\r\n\r\n  PIERRE BIARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[X.] Charles de Biencourt, esquire, sieur de Saint-Just and son of\r\nMonsieur de Poutrincourt.

I am giving to the Reverend Father\r\nProvincial the narrative in French of our whole undertaking, and of the\r\ncondition in which we found things here. This seemed to me the more\r\nnecessary and useful, as it was impossible for me to write it at the\r\nsame time in Latin. I have not yet been settled a week in Port Royal,\r\nand all the time has [42] been taken up by continual interruptions and\r\nin providing the necessities of life. As to ourselves, Father Masse\r\nand I, we are feeling very well, thank God; but we have been obliged\r\nto take a servant to do the drudgery. We could not dispense with one\r\nwithout a great deal of anxiety and trouble.\r\n\r\nM. de Potrincourt, who commands here in the name of the King, loves and\r\nesteems us in proportion to his piety.\r\n\r\nWe shall take the first opportunity to impart to you what may be, by\r\nthe grace of God, our prospects of success in this country.\r\n\r\nThe ship has already gone. I shall be obliged to overtake it in a\r\ncanoe, that it may not leave without my letters.\r\n\r\nI conjure Your Reverence, through the merits of Jesus Christ, to\r\nremember us and these solitary lands, and to come to our aid in so far\r\nas you are able, not only by the fervent prayers of our Society, but\r\nalso by the blessing and favor of our Holy Father the Pope (which I\r\nhave already invoked). Surely we sow in great poverty and in tears; may\r\nthe Lord grant that we some day reap in joy. Which will come to pass,\r\nas I hope and have said, [43] through the prayers and blessings of Your\r\nReverence, which are humbly solicited by your\r\n\r\n  Unworthy son and servant,\r\n  PIERRE BIARD, S.

With the desire of\r\npropagating religion, he had journeyed to the barbarous Canadians,\r\nand had been among the first settlers of that country, as has been\r\nnarrated in the fifth part (of this volume). Upon being driven\r\nthence by the heretical English, and compelled to return to France,\r\nhe entirely devoted himself [ii] to the service of his countrymen;\r\nand, that he might provide for their salvation, in no respect showed\r\nhimself deficient either in labor or diligence. His industry, however,\r\nwas especially enjoyed by the Paray le Monial, in the prefecture\r\nof Charolles, which community he long served with the customary\r\nministrations of the order. Finally, the prefect of the district,\r\nMarchio Ragne, upon being ordered by the king to lead troops into\r\nCampania against Ernest von Mansfeld,[47] who was threatening the\r\nfrontiers of France, had selected Biard as his companion during the\r\nexpedition, and as a minister of sacred rites. Upon that occasion one\r\nwould doubt whether the charity of the apostolic man, or his patience,\r\nwere the more remarkable. There was in the camp a great scarcity of\r\nprovisions. Rations were so poorly furnished to the soldiers that\r\nsome perished with hunger. Biard divided among the most needy of\r\nthem, both his own allowance and whatever small sums of money he had\r\ncollected by begging from the more wealthy, depriving himself of daily\r\nsustenance, that he might do a kindness to others. He had retired to\r\nAvignon, [iii] at last, that he might with a few days' leisure refresh\r\nhis energies, which had been worn out by so many toils. But divining,\r\nas it were, that the end of all labors and of life was at hand, he\r\nspent all that period in disciplining his spirit by pious meditations\r\namong the novices; and, although an aged man who had served his time,\r\nso adapted himself to the earliest form of the novitiate, that he\r\nomitted none of those exercises by which beginners are educated to a\r\ncontempt of themselves and of the world. While intent upon these, and\r\nalready thinking of nothing but heavenly things, death seized him on\r\nthe 17th day of November.\"\r\n\r\nTo these things it will perhaps not seem useless to add what has been\r\nwritten by an earlier author, namely, Philip Alegambe,[48] in the\r\nBibliography of the Authors of the Society of Jesus, under the word\r\nBiard:\r\n\r\n\"PETER BIARD, a French citizen, born in Grenoble, a laborer of great\r\nzeal, and of very many laurels which [iv] he first gathered in the\r\ndreadful and pathless forests of the Canadian tribes of North America.\r\nAlthough suffering there every extremity, he still experienced nothing\r\nmore brutal than the Heretics. The barbarous race, forgetting its\r\nsavageness, was learning to venerate the character of this most\r\nrighteous man; when, behold, Heresy, hostile to holiness and ignorant\r\nof God, burst, together with the English, upon the shores of Canada.\r\nThe reward of a very laborious expedition was great,--to drive thence\r\nthe hated Jesuit. For some time he was kept in bonds; and at last,\r\nstripped of everything, he was with difficulty restored to France. But\r\nmeanwhile, until it was safe to return to the wilds of Canada, he took\r\nvengeance in a holy manner for the injury inflicted by the Heretics;\r\nduring the rest of his life he sought with the greatest enthusiasm to\r\nwin to life those by whom he had been devoted to death. He had formerly\r\ntaught Theology at Lyons, not without commendation. On his return from\r\nthe Military Mission, when he had turned aside to Avignon, and, making\r\nuse of his opportunity, had retired into the Novitiate, in [v] almost\r\nthe very beginning of his spiritual Exercises, he was called away\r\nto the contemplation of paradise, as we believe, on the 19th day of\r\nNovember, in the year 1622.\r\n\r\nBesides a _Letter to R. P. General Commander from Port Royal_, and\r\n_An Account of the Expedition of the English against Canada_, Father\r\nBiard wrote _A Book Advocating the authority of the Pontiff_ against\r\nMartinet, a minister. In French, also, he published separately _An\r\nAccount of New France and of the journey thither of the Fathers of the\r\nSociety of Jesus_. Lyons, by L. Muguet, 1616, in 12mo.\"--[O'CALLAGHAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[vii] Tabvla Rervm.\r\n                                                              Pag.\r\n\r\n  _SOCIETAS Jesu, in Canadam, seu Novam Franciam inducta_      5\r\n\r\n  II _Initium Canadicæ Missionis, & primi fructus_             7\r\n\r\n  III _Domicilia Societatis & Missiones in Nova Francia_       18\r\n\r\n  IV _Missio Canadensis ab Anglis proturbata_                  25\r\n\r\n  V _Unus è Societate interficitur; alii Canada ejiciuntur_    27\r\n\r\n  VI _Missiones Societatis Jesu in America septentrionali, Anno 1710_\r\n                                                               37\r\n\r\n\r\n[vii] Table of Contents.\r\n\r\n[_The page numbers refer to O'Callaghan's Reprint._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             Page.\r\n\r\n  _THE Society of Jesus introduced into Canada or New France_  5\r\n\r\n  II _Beginning and first fruits of the Canadian Mission_      7\r\n\r\n  III _Settlements and Missions of the Society in New France_  18\r\n\r\n  IV _The Canadian Mission driven out by the English_          25\r\n\r\n  V _One of the members of the Society is killed; the others are expelled\r\n  from Canada_                                                 27\r\n\r\n  VI _Missions of the Society of Jesus in North America, in the year\r\n  1710_                                                        37\r\n\r\n\r\nMissionis Canadicæ Relatio.\r\n\r\n[321 §.

II.] THE SOCIETY OF JESUS INTRODUCED INTO CANADA, OR NEW FRANCE.\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA is occupied principally by three nations--the Spanish,\r\nthe French, and the English. Mexico, a part of Florida and of\r\nCalifornia, belongs to the Spanish dominions. The shores opposite to\r\nthe rising sun, and stretching Southward, have been occupied at various\r\ntimes by the English, the Swedes, and the Dutch. The French possess the\r\nterritory which lies between these and the Mexicans, towards the north\r\nand west, commonly called New France or Canada. Nothing fouler and more\r\nhideous than the savage Canadians could have been imagined, before they\r\nbegan to soften under the influence of religion, as will appear from\r\nmatters to be presented in the tenth Paragraph. Now, barbarism and the\r\nvile array of sins have given place to reason and virtue, which seems\r\nto confirm our faith in this ancient prophecy: [_Isaiah, c. 35._] _The\r\nland that was desolate and impassable shall be glad, and the wilderness\r\nshall rejoice, and shall flourish like the lily._\r\n\r\n\r\nINITIUM CANADICÆ MISSIONIS, & PRIMI FRUCTUS.\r\n\r\nAMERICÆ littora, Franciæ obversa, Galli jam inde ab anno MDXXIV.\r\nidentidem lustraverunt: sed obiter, & quasi prætereuntes. Demum\r\nsuperiori seculo ineunte, regionem interiorem subiit Samuel Camplenius,\r\nqui Canadensis coloniæ parens merito dici potest. Jamque negotiatio\r\nbellissimè procedebat, cum Henricus IV. de religione magis, quàm de\r\ncommercio solicitus, in hanc Orbis novi partem inferre Christiana sacra\r\ndecrevit, anno MDCVIII. ac Societatis homines ad hanc Apostolicam\r\nexpeditionem postulavit. Certior de consilio Regis factus P. Petrus\r\nCotonus, regiæ conscientiæ moderator, jussusque strenuos quamprimum\r\ndesignare sacerdotes, qui solida tanti operis jacerent fundamenta,\r\nSocietatis Præpositum admonuit. Ex omni, non juvenum modo, sed etiam\r\nsenum, numero, laboriosam Missionem flagitantium, delecti sunt P.\r\nPetrus Biardus, Gratianopolitanus, theologiæ professor in collegio\r\nLugdunensi; & P. Enemundus Massæus, Lugdunensis. Moram consiliis\r\nfelicibus attulit Regis improvisa mors; & Societatis amicorum studia,\r\nqui navem & reliqua itineri necessaria comparabant, debilitavit. Sed\r\ninvicta rebus adversis Cotoni pietas, Reginæ auctoritatem interposuit,\r\nut difficultates objectas profligaret. Ergo indicitur profectio:\r\nPatres Deppam advolant, inde vela Novam in Franciam facturi. Ecce\r\nautem repentè inexpectatus obex. Ea navis erat Potrincurtii, nobilis\r\nGalli: duobus tamen mercatoribus Calvinianis obnoxia, utpote qui\r\nsumptus non leves ad illam armamentis instruendam fecerant. Isti\r\nsimul atque imponendos in hanc homines Societatis audierunt, negant\r\nenimvero se passuros ut è portu solvat. Opponitur imperium Reginæ,\r\nmandata ingeminantur. Respondent per se non stare quin sacerdotes\r\nalii quilibet admittantur; at sibi cum nostris hominibus nihil esse\r\nrei velle. Ubi vidit Cotonus improborum pertinaciam frangi non posse,\r\nalia rem aggressus est via. Erat matrona non pietate minus quàm\r\ngenere nobilis, Antonia Guerchevillæa. Hæc negotium Missionis haud\r\nsecus procurabat, ac suum: utque non vulgarem apud multos gratiam,\r\nvirtutis opinione collegerat, magnam subito pecuniæ vim corrogavit,\r\nqua mercatoribus hæreticis summa rependeretur, ab iis in adornandam\r\nnavim contributa. Sic illis rejectis & invitis, Patres admissi\r\nsuerunt. At, quia interim extractum tempus fuerat, non ante VII.\r\nKalend. Februarias, cum hyemaret asperum æquor, vela sunt facta. Hinc\r\nmensium quatuor cursus fuit, qui vulgo duorum est; ac morbis intus,\r\ntempestatibus foris, infestus. Ingressi demum ostia Laurentiani fluvii\r\nXI. Kal. Junias, ipso sacro Pentecostes die, vestigia Christianæ\r\nreligionis aliqua invenere, leviter ab iis quos è Gallia profectos in\r\nhanc plagam diximus, impressa. Cum enim illis ignotus [322] gentis\r\nsermo, nec certum constansque in humo barbara domicilium esset,\r\nfacultas non suppetebat erudiendi quos obiter baptizabant: quique\r\npristinos in mores revoluti, Christianum vix retinebant nomen,\r\nilludque popularibus vitiis conspurcabant. Prima Patribus cura fuit\r\nut sacellum construerent, perdiscerent linguam vernaculam, excolerent\r\nGallos, qui è veteri Francia in novam navigaverant. Instituta est\r\nsolennis supplicatio; Christus sanctissimi Sacramenti velo tectus, &\r\nquanto fieri potuit maximo apparatu circumvectus, in terræ felicis,\r\ntot sanctis postea frequentandæ veluti possessionem auspicatò venit.\r\nProxima infantibus sacro lavandis fonte cura est data, quorum nonnulli,\r\npost susceptum salutis sacramentum, ad terram viventium possidendam,\r\nquasi gentis totius nomine, demigrarunt. Puellam annos natam novem,\r\noppressam gravi morbo, parentes abjecerant. Cum enim artis medicæ\r\nprorsus ignara natio sit, ægrotos facile desperat, neque cibo, aut\r\ncuratione ulla, juvat. Depositam Patres à parentibus postularunt,\r\nut expiarent lympha salutari. Ultro illis permissa est, quippe quæ\r\ninstar mortui canis haberetur. Abductam in mapale separatum curavere\r\nsedulo: edoctam, quantum erat necesse; baptizatam, ac nona post luce\r\nmortuam, coelo intulerunt. Eadem Sociorum caritas lætiorem exitum in\r\njuvene sortita est. Ejus pater Membertous, primus omnium, uti narrant,\r\nbarbarorum, cum è Gallia navigatum illuc fuit, in Christianorum numerum\r\nvenerat; homo strenuus, & omnium popularium testimonio, ceteris longè\r\npræstans animi robore, belli scientia, clientelarum multitudine, &\r\ngloriosi claritudine cognominis; quippe Magni Imperatoris titulum\r\npublico suffragio consecutus. Hunc obtinebat locum Membertous inter\r\nSouriquios, qui Acadiam, circa ostia Laurentiani amnis, incolunt.\r\nEjus filium difficili ægritudine conflictatum P. Biardus invisit.\r\nMiratur nihil triste in tugurio; non planctum, non flebiles nænias:\r\nimo epulum, choream, & duos tresve canes alligatos. Quærit quid hæc\r\nsibi velint. Respondent juvenem brevi esse moriturum, amicos vocatos:\r\nillis epulum parari: funebrem choream postea ducendam: canes, quos\r\nvidebat, interficiendos, placandis mortui Manibus. Exclamavit Pater\r\nnequaquam ista Christianis hominibus convenire, & impias consuetudines\r\ngraviter increpuit. Senior, adolescentis parens, ignorantiam excusavit;\r\nceterum se ac filium in ipsius esse potestate; doceret, juberet,\r\nimperata facturos. Sacerdos vetuit ne canes interficerentur: saltatores\r\nimportunos amandavit: epuli partem, quæ superstitionis habere\r\nnihil videbatur, permisit: in primis autem, ne deponeretur penitus\r\nægroti cura prohibuit; imo suasit ut ad Gallorum domicilia, quamvis\r\nlongè disjuncta, deportaretur; sperare se, favente Deo, futurum ut\r\nconvalesceret. Benignè auditus est à Membertoo: delatus æger ad nos\r\nfuit, ridentibus, ac bolum tantum tam subito è faucibus ereptum sibi\r\ndolentibus veneficis, & circulatoribus, quorum sententiâ conclamatus\r\nadolescens vivere posse negabatur. Ac sane agebat animam, cùm triduo\r\npost ad Gallorum domicilia pervenit, fractus itinere ac morbo. Patrum\r\ntamen arte ac studio, & scilicet Dei benignitate, recreatus est;\r\nnec ipse tantum in fide catholica confirmatus, sed ejus capessendæ\r\ndesiderio complures inflammati.\r\n\r\nIncidit aliquanto post in morbum pater adolescentis, & ad nos similiter\r\ndeferri voluit, ubi nostrum in tugurium, atque adeo in unius è Patribus\r\nlectum acceptus, piè vitam clausit; quodque barbaris novum accidit ac\r\nmolestum, illatus est in commune Christianæ plebi sepulcrum: nam ipsi\r\na sepulcris majorum ægerrime divelluntur. Curatum funus illustri, ut\r\nrerum ferebant angustiæ, pompa. Nec honore isto qualicumque indigna\r\nbarbari virtus erat, qui etiam ante quàm Christum nosset, non potuerat\r\nadduci ut plures una duceret uxores: id naturæ ac rationi magis\r\nconsentaneum arbitratus. Post susceptam vero Christi Fidem ita vixerat,\r\nut barbaris admirationi esset, Christianis exemplo.\r\n\r\nHæc domi gesta. Egressi deinde quasi pomerio præcones Evangelici magnam\r\nregionis partem lustravere. Divina res, ubicumque licuit, facta:\r\nimpositæ manus ægrotis, conciliati munusculis parentes ac liberi;\r\ndata Gallis, novas condentibus sedes, opera; necnon classiariis atque\r\nvectoribus. Non defuit patientiæ læta seges, ac tanta interdum exstitit\r\nannonæ penuria, ut singulis hebdomadis certum [323] unicuique demensum\r\ndaretur, quod vix sufficiebat in unum diem, videlicet panis unciæ\r\ndecem, selibra carnis sale maceratæ, & pisorum, fabarumve aliquantulum.\r\nAdhæc, erat sibi quisque faber, sarcinator, pistor, coquus, lignator,\r\n& aquator. Occurrebant interdum Patribus, in his ærumnis, voces\r\nillorum, quibus Moses provinciam explorandæ Chananitidis dederat,\r\n[_Num. c._ 13, 14.] _Terra hæc devorat habitatores suos; ibi vidimus\r\nmonstra quædam filiorum Enac, de genere Giganteo, quibus comparati,\r\nquasi locustæ videbamur_. At simul veniebat in mentem oratio Josue,\r\n& Calebi, plena divinæ fiduciæ: _Terra valde bona est. Si propitius\r\nfuerit Dominus, inducet nos in eam. Neque timeatis populum terræ hujus,\r\nDominus nobiscum est._\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNING AND FIRST FRUITS OF THE CANADIAN MISSION.\r\n\r\nTHE French had, since the year 1524, often visited the coasts of\r\nAmerica opposite to France, but cursorily, and, as it were, while\r\npassing by. Finally, at the beginning of the last century, Samuel\r\nChamplain, who well deserves to be called the parent of the Canadian\r\ncolony, entered the region of the interior. Already was the undertaking\r\nprogressing very favorably, when Henry IV., more solicitous for\r\nreligion than for commerce, resolved, in the year 1608, to introduce\r\nChristian rites into this part of the new World, and asked members of\r\nthe Society to undertake this Apostolic enterprise. Upon being informed\r\nof the plan of the King, and ordered to choose as soon as possible\r\nenergetic priests who would lay solidly the foundations of so great a\r\nwork, Father Coton, the confessor of the king, informed the Commander\r\nof the Society. From the whole number, not only of youths but also\r\nof old men, who sought this laborious Duty, there were chosen Father\r\nPeter Biard, of Grenoble, a professor of theology in the college\r\nof Lyons, and Father Enemond Massé, of Lyons. The unforeseen death\r\nof the King delayed this auspicious enterprise, and diminished the\r\nenthusiasm of the friends of the Society, who were providing a ship\r\nand other necessaries for the voyage. But the pious Coton, unconquered\r\nby adversity, brought in the authority of the Queen, in order that\r\nhe might overcome the difficulties in his way. As a result, the time\r\nwas set for their departure, and the Fathers hastened to Dieppe, in\r\norder that they might sail thence for New France. But, lo! suddenly\r\nan unexpected obstacle. Their ship belonged to Poutrincourt, a French\r\nnobleman; it was, however, subject to the control of two Calvinistic\r\nmerchants, since they had incurred no light expense toward providing\r\nher with equipments. As soon as they heard that members of the Society\r\nwere to be embarked upon her, they refused to allow her to leave\r\nthe port. The authority of the Queen was invoked; her commands were\r\nreiterated. They answered that they would not refuse admission to any\r\nother sort of priests, but that they were unwilling to have anything to\r\ndo with our men. When Coton saw that the stubbornness of the rascals\r\ncould not be overcome, he approached the matter by another way. There\r\nwas a lady distinguished not less for piety than for birth, Antoinette\r\nde Guercheville. This woman was as solicitous for the interests of\r\nthe Mission as for her own; and since she had acquired an uncommon\r\ninfluence among many, because of her reputation for integrity, she\r\nquickly collected a large sum of money, by means of which the heretical\r\nmerchants were repaid the amount which they had spent in equipping the\r\nship. So, although the merchants were disappointed and unwilling, the\r\nFathers were admitted. But, because of the intervening delay, they\r\ndid not sail until the 26th of January, when the storms of winter\r\ncaused a raging sea. On this account the voyage was of four months'\r\nduration, although ordinarily of two, and was terrible because of\r\ndisease within and tempests without. Having entered at last the mouth\r\nof the St. Lawrence river on the 22nd day of May, on the holy day of\r\nPentecost, they came upon some traces of the Christian religion, which\r\nhad been superficially impressed by those whom we have mentioned as\r\nhaving journeyed from France into this region. For, since the speech\r\nof the people was unknown [322] to them, and they had no certain and\r\nfixed residence in this savage land, there was no opportunity for\r\neducating those whom they chanced to baptize, and who, plunging again\r\ninto their former habits, scarcely retained the Christian name, while\r\ndefiling it with their native vices. The first concern of the Fathers\r\nwas to build a chapel, to learn the language of the country, and to\r\ninstruct the Frenchmen who had emigrated from old to new France. A\r\nsolemn Thanksgiving was enjoined; the figure of Christ, covered with a\r\ncanopy, was carried about with the greatest possible ceremony; and he\r\ncame auspiciously into the possession, so to speak, of the happy land\r\nafterwards to be frequented by so many holy men. Next, attention was\r\ngiven to laving the infants in the sacred font, of whom some, after\r\nreceiving the sacrament of salvation, departed to their homes in the\r\nland of the immortals, in the name, as it were, of the whole race.\r\nA girl aged nine years, afflicted with a grievous disease, had been\r\nabandoned by her parents. For, since the race is altogether ignorant\r\nof the art of medicine, they readily despair of the sick, and neither\r\nprovide them with food nor care for them in any way. The Fathers asked\r\nher parents to give them the forsaken child, in order that they might\r\nsanctify her with the water of salvation. She was readily handed over\r\nto them; and naturally, inasmuch as she was considered no better than\r\na dead dog. Taking her apart to their hut they gave her assiduous\r\ncare; she was baptized, and, dying on the ninth day afterward, they\r\nintroduced her into Heaven. The same charity of the Associates\r\nresulted more fortunately in the case of a young boy. His father was\r\nMembertou, who, they say, in the early days of navigation thither\r\nfrom France, first of all the savages became a Christian; he was an\r\nenergetic man, and, according to the testimony of all his countrymen,\r\nfar excelled others in vigor of mind, in knowledge of war, in number of\r\ndependents, and the distinction of a glorious name, for by public vote\r\nhe had acquired the title of \"Great Chief.\" This position Membertou\r\nheld among the Souriquois, who inhabit Acadia about the mouth of the\r\nSt. Lawrence river. Father Biard visited Membertou's son, who was\r\nsuffering from a dangerous illness. He was surprised that there was no\r\ngrief in the wigwam; no lamentations, no tearful dirges; instead, a\r\nfeast, a dance, and two or three dogs fastened together. He asked what\r\nthese things meant. They answered that the youth would die in a short\r\ntime; that the friends had been invited, and for them the banquet was\r\nbeing prepared; that afterwards a funeral dance was to be conducted;\r\nand that the dogs which he saw were to be killed to appease the Spirit\r\nof the dead boy. The Father exclaimed that these things were quite\r\nunfitting for Christian men, and severely censured the impious custom.\r\nThe parent of the youth excused his ignorance; he said that henceforth\r\nhe and his son should be under the Father's direction; he begged him\r\nto instruct and command them, and said that they would execute his\r\norders. The Priest forbade the killing of the dogs; he dismissed the\r\nrude dancers; a part of the repast he allowed, as not devoted to\r\nsuperstitious rites. He insisted that the patient should no longer be\r\nneglected; still more, he persuaded them that the boy should be taken\r\nto the dwellings of the French, although these were far distant, saying\r\nthat he hoped, by the favor of God, for his recovery. The priest was\r\nfavorably heard by Membertou; the patient was brought to us, although\r\nthe sorcerers and medicine-men, who declared that the unhappy youth\r\ncould not live, ridiculed this decision, and grieved that such a morsel\r\nshould be snatched suddenly from their jaws. And indeed he was at the\r\npoint of death, when, three days afterward, exhausted by the journey,\r\nand by sickness, he arrived at the French settlement. Nevertheless, by\r\nthe skill and devotion of the Fathers, and by the kindness of God, he\r\nwas restored; nor was he alone established in the Catholic faith, but\r\nmany of his countrymen were inflamed with the desire of adopting it.\r\n\r\nSome time afterward, the father of the young man fell sick, and wished\r\nto be also brought to us, where, after being received into our hut\r\nand even into the bed of one of the Fathers, he piously departed this\r\nlife; and, what was novel and displeasing to the savages, he was buried\r\namong Christian people; for they themselves are very reluctant to be\r\nseparated from the tombs of their ancestors. His funeral was observed,\r\nas far as the limitations of the case permitted, with marked ceremony.\r\nNor was this savage's virtue unworthy in any respect of that honor;\r\nfor, even before he had learned of Christ, he could not be induced\r\nto marry more than one wife, considering this more in harmony with\r\nnature and reason. But, after his acceptance of the Faith of Christ,\r\nhe so lived that he was to the savages an object of admiration, to the\r\nChristians an example.\r\n\r\nThese things were accomplished at home. Then going forth, as it were,\r\nfrom the city walls, the heralds of the Gospel traversed a great\r\npart of the country. A godly act was performed whenever opportunity\r\nallowed; hands were laid upon the sick; parents and children were\r\nconciliated by means of little gifts; services were rendered to the\r\nFrench who were establishing new homes; nor were the seamen and ships'\r\npassengers neglected. There was not lacking a glad harvest for their\r\npatience. Meanwhile, so great a scarcity of provisions existed, that\r\nfor each week [323] a ration was allotted, so scanty that it was hardly\r\nsufficient for one day; namely, ten ounces of bread, half a pound of\r\nsalted meat, and a handful of peas or beans. In addition to this, each\r\nman was his own mechanic, mender, miller, cook, hewer of wood, and\r\ndrawer of water. There occurred sometimes to the Fathers, in the midst\r\nof the miseries, the words of those to whom Moses had given the task of\r\nreconnoitering Canaan: [_Num. c. 13, 14._] _This land ... devoureth its\r\ninhabitants; ... there we saw certain monsters of the sons of Enac of\r\nthe Giant-kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like locusts._ But at\r\nthe same time there came into mind the speech of Joshua and of Caleb,\r\nfull of divine trust: _The land which we have gone round is very good.\r\nIf the Lord be favorable, he will bring us into it.... Fear ye not the\r\npeople of this land, ... the Lord is with us._\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMICILIA SOCIETATIS & MISSIONES IN NOVA FRANCIA.\r\n\r\nET esse cum servis suis, ac militibus Dominum, exitus comprobavit.\r\nNam hoc anno MDCCIII. ineunte, cum hæc scribimus, præter Quebecense\r\ncollegium, numerantur in hac _terra deserta_ prius _& invia_ triginta\r\n& amplius florentissimæ cultissimæque Missiones nostræ Societatis.\r\nPrima in conspectu Quebeci, decimo ab urbe lapide, Lauretana dicitur.\r\nAltera in pago Tadussaco sedet: ad ripam fluvii Laurentiani, leucis\r\ninfra Quebecum LX. versus ortum. Tres aliæ supra Quebecum ipsum,\r\nlonge procurrunt in Boream, circa lacum S. Joannis: una in eo loco,\r\nqui à septem insulis nomen habet; altera, in pago Chigoutimino;\r\ntertia, secus amnem Saguenæum. Excoluntur ibi Montagnæi, Papinachii,\r\nMistassini, & aliæ passim gentes errabundæ. Jam, si versus obeuntis\r\nsolis partes & fluminis Laurentiani fontem tendas, occurret in ejus\r\nripâ septentrionali pagus Trium fluminum dictus, quia ibi tria quædam\r\nflumina confluunt: abest Quebeco septem octove dierum iter. Florebat\r\nillic AlgonKinorum Missio longe pulcherrima, sed hanc vinum igne\r\nvaporatum & stillatum, à mercatoribus Europæis, facilem inde quæstum\r\nmale captantibus invectum, vehementer labefactavit inducta ebrietate.\r\nPensat hæc damna virtus ac pietas AbnaKisorum. Triplex apud illos\r\nstatio collocata una Quebeco non procul, in XLVI. gradu latitudinis,\r\nnomine S. Francisci Salesii & patrocinio insignita: aliæ duæ sunt\r\nremotiores; loco nomen est NipisiKouit. Trans amnem Laurentianum ad\r\nMeridiem funduntur Iroquæorum quinque nationes. Septem sunt apud illos\r\npræconum Evangelii domicilia, per centum quinquaginta leucas sparsa. Ex\r\niis sex profligata fuerant bello Gallos inter & Iroquæos conflato circa\r\nannum MDCLXXXII. Revocata cum religione pax anno MDCCII. omnia priorem\r\nin statum restituit. In iis Iroquæorum Missionibus ea præcipuè floret,\r\nquæ à S. Francisco Xaverio nomen habet, ad Montem-Regalem.\r\n\r\nSupra Iroquæos, versus occasum & Aquilonem, intra quadragesimum\r\ngradum & XLV. cernere est majores duos lacus angusto freto junctos:\r\nalter, isque amplior, Ilinæorum; alter Huronum dicitur. Hos ingens\r\nterræ lingua dividit, cujus in apice sedet Missio S. Ignatii, sive\r\nMissilimaKinacana. Supra duos istos lacus tertius est, ambobus major,\r\nquem superiorem lacum appellant. Hujus in aditu constituta est Missio\r\nS. Mariæ à Saltu. Interjectum inter hunc, & binos inferiores lacus\r\nspatium occupant OutaouaKi, apud quos plurima stativa Societas habet.\r\nEjusmodi arces religionis (sic enim appellare Missiones licet) unde\r\nsuos profert milites, & sacra explicat vexilla, tres circa lacum\r\nIlinæorum positæ sunt, prima inter Puteatamisos: Missio Sancti Josephi\r\nnuncupatur: altera inter KiKarousos, MasKoutensos, & Outagamisos;\r\nS. Francisci Xaverii nomen obtinet: tertia inter Oumiamisos, Angeli\r\nCustodis. Infra memoratos lacus, supra ipsam Floridam, vastissimos\r\npererrant campos Ilinæi. Ibi amplissima statio, cui nomen ab immaculata\r\nVirginis Matris conceptione impositum, tres in Missiones secatur, &\r\nad fluvium usque Missisipum procurrit. Insidet ejusdem fluminis ripis\r\nmissio Baiogulana, in trigesimo primo gradu latitudinis: demum ultima\r\nprotenditur secundum eundem amnem versus Mexicanum sinum. Hæc visum est\r\nenucleare paulo distinctius, & quasi sub uno statim aspectu ponere, ut\r\nintelligatur quò singula referenda sint, quæ postea de Nova Francia\r\nnarrabuntur.\r\n\r\nRestat ignota Europæis adhuc pars Canadæ immensa, ultra Missisipum\r\nfluvium, clementiori subjecta coelo, frequens incolis, armentis\r\nfrugibusque læta; vitæ veræ ac salutis expers. Hæc generosos Christi\r\nmilites vocat. Nec non altera [324] longe isti dissimilis, quæ\r\nrigidis circa Hudsonium finum, à gradu LV. ad LX. aut LXX. subjecta\r\nseptentrionibus, nivibus ac pruinis demersa, tanto æquiùs implorat\r\nopem, quanto gravioribus incommodis conflictatur. Hic Societas ante\r\nannos paucos prima coepit figere vestigia. Illucescet illa, spero,\r\ndies, cum obvallatum periculis ac laboribus iter eadem perrumpet. Non\r\nsine magno molimine claustra Tartari, oppressas injusta servitute\r\nanimas retinentis, perfringuntur; neque illa ipsa, tot florens modo\r\ncoloniis, Missio Canadica statim suam est maturitatem adepta. Ægrè per\r\nsexdecim annos tanquam in salebris hæsit, nec suam quandam nacta formam\r\nest, nisi anno seculi superioris quinto & vigesimo, cùm se aliquando ex\r\nillis angustiis explicuit, P. Petri Cotoni, cui sua debebat primordia,\r\nbeneficio, ut sexta Pars Historiæ fusius exponet.\r\n\r\nNunc ærumnarum ac periculorum plenos natales referimus laboriosæ\r\nMissionis, quæ vix nata, in ipsis cunis per Anglos propemodùm extincta\r\nest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENTS AND MISSIONS OF THE SOCIETY IN NEW FRANCE.\r\n\r\nAND that the Lord is with his servants and soldiers, the outcome has\r\nproved. For, in the beginning of this year 1703, while we are writing\r\nthese things, there are numbered in this formerly _solitary and\r\nunexplored country_ more than thirty very prosperous and well-equipped\r\nMissions of our Society, besides the college of Quebec. The first of\r\nthese, in sight of Quebec, at the tenth mile-stone from the city, is\r\ncalled Lorette. Another is situated in the district of Tadoussac, on\r\nthe shore of the river St. Lawrence, sixty leagues below Quebec toward\r\nthe east. Three others, above Quebec itself, extend far into the North\r\nabout lake St. John; one in that place which takes its name from the\r\nseven islands;[49] another in the district of Chigoutimini;[50] the\r\nthird on the Saguenay river. There they minister to the Montagnais, the\r\nPapinachois, the Mistassins, and other wandering tribes. Now, if you\r\njourney towards the regions of the setting sun, and the source of the\r\nSt. Lawrence river, you will find upon its northern bank a district\r\ncalled Three rivers, because there three rivers flow together: it is\r\ndistant from Quebec seven or eight days' journey. Here, there formerly\r\nflourished the most successful Mission of the Algonquins; but it has\r\nbeen much weakened through the drunkenness induced by brandy, brought\r\nin by European merchants who thus wickedly derive an easy profit. But\r\nthese losses are compensated by the virtue and piety of the Abenakis.\r\nAmong them a mission of three stations has been established; one\r\nlocated among them, not far from Quebec, on the forty-sixth parallel\r\nof latitude, distinguished by the name and patronage of St. Francis de\r\nSales: the other two are more remote, at a place named Nipisikouit.\r\nAcross the St. Lawrence river, to the South, extend the five nations of\r\nthe Iroquois. There are among them seven stations of the Evangelists,\r\nscattered through a hundred and fifty leagues. Of these, six were\r\ndestroyed in the war which arose between the French and Iroquois, about\r\nthe year 1682. Peace, together with the recall of the missionaries,\r\nin the year 1702 restored all things to their previous condition.[51]\r\nAmong these Missions of the Iroquois, that one is especially\r\nflourishing which is named for St. Francis Xavier, at Montreal.[52]\r\n\r\nAbove the Iroquois, toward the west and North, between the fortieth and\r\nforty-fifth parallels, one may see two great lakes joined by a narrow\r\nstrait; the larger one is called the lake of the Ilinois,[53] the other\r\nthe lake of the Hurons.[54] These are separated by a large peninsula,\r\nat the point of which is situated the Mission of St. Ignatius, or\r\nMissilimakinac.[55] Above these two lakes there is a third, greater\r\nthan either, called lake superior. At the entrance of this lake has\r\nbeen established the Mission of Ste. Marie at the Sault.[56] The space\r\nbetween this and two smaller lakes is occupied by the Outaouaki, among\r\nwhom the Society has many stations. Three such citadels of religion\r\n(for thus it is proper to call the Missions), whence she leads forth\r\nher soldiers and unfurls her sacred standards, have been located about\r\nthe lake of the Ilinois: the first, among the Puteatamis, and called\r\nthe Mission of St. Joseph; another, among the Kikarous, Maskoutens,\r\nand Outagamies, and possessing the name of St. Francis Xavier:[57] the\r\nthird, among the Oumiamis,[58] has the name of the Guardian Angel.\r\nBelow the lakes which have been mentioned, above Florida, the Ilinois\r\nroam through most extensive territories. There, a very large station,\r\nnamed from the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mother, is divided\r\ninto three Missions, and extends as far as the river Mississippi. Upon\r\nthe banks of the same river is situated the mission of Baiogula, at the\r\nthirty-first parallel of latitude;[59] and it extends down that stream\r\ntowards the gulf of Mexico. It has seemed best to explain these matters\r\nsomewhat fully, because the individual facts here specified will be\r\nreferred to in what is to be hereafter narrated concerning New France.\r\n\r\nThere remains unknown to Europeans, up to the present time, an immense\r\nportion of Canada, beyond the Mississippi river, situated beneath a\r\nmilder sky, well-inhabited, and abounding in animal and vegetable life;\r\nthe whole, deprived of true life and of salvation. This region calls to\r\nthe generous soldiers of Christ. So is it, likewise, [324] with another\r\nregion far dissimilar to that, around the frozen Hudson bay, from the\r\nfifty-fifth parallel to the sixtieth or seventieth; lying at the north,\r\nplunged in snows and frosts, it even more justly implores aid, as it\r\nis afflicted by more weighty ills. Here the Society, a few years ago,\r\nfirst began to plant its footsteps. That day will dawn, I hope, when\r\nit shall break through the barriers of dangers and toils. Not without\r\ngreat exertion are the gates of Tartarus, which hold burdened souls in\r\nunmerited bondage, broken down; nor did the Canadian Mission itself,\r\nnow flourishing with so many settlements, all at once attain its full\r\ndevelopment. Grievously, through sixteen years did it, so to speak,\r\nstick in a rough road; indeed, it did not take shape until 1625, when\r\nit was extricated from its perplexities by the aid of Father Peter\r\nCoton, to whom it owed its origin, as the sixth Part of this History\r\nwill more fully explain.\r\n\r\nNow we return to the natal days, full of hardships and dangers, of the\r\ntoilsome Mission, which, scarcely born, was almost exterminated in its\r\ncradle by the English.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSIO CANADENSIS AB ANGLIS PROTURBATA.\r\n\r\nSOCIIS illic degentibus venerant auxilio Idibus Maii anni MDCXIII.\r\nPater Quintinus, & Frater Gilbertus Thetus, regio diplomate instructi,\r\nquo facultas ipsis dabatur novi domicilii commodo loco ædificandi.\r\nGallos reperiunt incumbentes in condendam urbem, & periculi, quod\r\ninstabat, ignaros.

Postquam\r\ncognoverunt Gallicas naves ibi consistere, arma expediunt, & in portum\r\ninvehuntur. Interea Galli ancipiti opinione suspensi, amicos an hostes\r\ncenserent, quos recta in suam stationem ventus inferebat, eventum\r\ntrepidi opperiebantur. Brevi, quinam essent patuit.

The English, a few years before, had occupied\r\nVirginia. This eastern coast-region of North America, situated between\r\nFlorida and New France, is comprised between the thirty-sixth and\r\nthirty-eighth parallels. While the English were sailing thither in the\r\nsummer months of the year 1613, and, having lost their bearings and\r\nstrayed from their course, on account of the fogs, which usually are\r\nvery heavy upon this sea in the summer, they were gradually borne to\r\nthe shore where the French had settled,[61] not far from the port of\r\nSt. Sauveur. When they learned that a French ship was stationed there,\r\nthey made ready their weapons and entered the harbor. Meanwhile the\r\nFrench, uncertain whether they should consider as friends or foes those\r\nwhom the wind was bearing directly towards their position, tremblingly\r\nawaited the outcome. Who they were was soon apparent. The English\r\nattacked the French ship,[62] wherein few were drawn up in defense--for\r\nthe others had departed to work on the buildings--and with no trouble\r\ncaptured her.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNUS È SOCIETATE INTERFICITUR; ALII CANADA EJICIUNTUR.\r\n\r\nPRIMO in conflictu Gilbertus Thetus, domesticæ rei adiutor è Societate,\r\nconfossus lethali plaga, postridie religiosa morte occubuit. Ceteri\r\nPatres qui stabant in littore, in potestatem Argalli, prætoris Angli,\r\nvenerunt. Ille, dum Gallicæ navis prædam & supellectilem recenset,\r\nsubduxit clam è Saussæii, navis Gallicæ gubernatoris, qui huic\r\nexpeditioni præerat, scrinio regium diploma, cujus fide tota novæ\r\ncoloniæ ratio nitebatur. Mox ipsum Saussæium è littore subeuntem\r\nadortus, quærit ex eo quo jure, cujus auctoritate, novas tam prope\r\nVirginiam sedes moliatur. Laudavit Saussæius regium diploma, quod se\r\nin capsis rite conscriptum habere dixit. Ad eas ubi ventum est, vidit\r\nintegras, & obseratas, suisque omnia digesta locis agnovit, diploma\r\nnullum apparuit. Tum Argallus, vultu & voce ad severitatem compositis,\r\nfugitivos & prædones conclamat, ac necem commeruisse pronunciat,\r\nsimulque navim suis diripiendam tradit. Illum interea Patres obsecrant\r\nut victis benignè consulat, quibus objici nihil noxæ possit aliud, quàm\r\nquod in pacato solo fuerint nimium securi: auctoritatem Regis Galliæ\r\nnon dubiam ac voluntatem testantur. Prætor probè sibi conscius vera\r\nnarrari, comiter eos audivit, & omnibus potestatem in Galliam redeundi\r\nfecit. Duas in naviculas infelix turba imponitur, quarum una cursum\r\nin Galliam rectà dirigeret; altera cum aliquot Anglis solveret in\r\nVirginiam, inde Franciam petitura. Hanc PP. Biardus & Quintinus, illam\r\nP. Massæus, & Saussæius conscenderunt. Utriusque sors longè dispar\r\nfuit. Quæ Saussæium & P. Massæum vehebat dum oram maritimam legit,\r\nannonâ, nautis, armamentis destituta, incidit in geminas naves reditum\r\nin Galliam adornantes. Jungit se illis læta, cumque suis vectoribus\r\nMaclovium, Britanniæ Aremoricæ oppidum, paucis diebus tenuit.\r\n\r\nInterim Argallus, classis Anglicæ præfectus, Patres Biardum & Quintinum\r\ndeducturus in Virginiam, ut constitutum fuerat, paululum iis præivit\r\ncum sua navi prætoria. Virginiam obtinebat Anglus ferox, nomini\r\nGallico, ac Societati nostræ [325] perinfensus. Ubi adventare Jesuitas\r\naudivit, vociferatur perdendos homines improbissimos, busta pietatis\r\nac religionis. Argallus contra nitebatur; seque vivo nihil molestiæ\r\ndamnive Patribus inferendum affirmabat: hanc enim ipsis dederat fidem;\r\n& regium diploma, cujus auctoritate colonia Gallica in Novam Franciam\r\ndeducebatur, protulit. Hoc diplomate inflammatus homo furiosus,\r\nexturbandos è Nova Francia Gallos clamat. In hanc sententiam Angli\r\nproceres iverunt. Jubetur Argallus viam remetiri; Gallos, quicumque\r\nsuperessent, ejicere, domicilia evertere, & æquare solo. Rediit: arces\r\nin ora Canadensi extructas incendit, omnia delevit, ac naves duas in\r\nRegio Portu deprehensas, invasit.\r\n\r\nDum hæc in Canada geruntur, naves Anglicæ, præeuntem Argallum secutæ,\r\naliæ procul à Virginia ventorum vi abreptæ; aliæ undis haustæ sunt.\r\nUna, cui Turnellus Anglus præerat, & qua Patres Quintinus ac Biardus\r\nvehebantur, continentibus sexdecim dierum procellis vexata, in Azores,\r\nLusitanorum ad Africæ littus insulas, celerrimè defertur. Hic vero\r\nnovum exoritur periculum. Turnellus poenam metuens, quòd Societatis\r\nsacerdotes per summam immanitatem domicilio avulsos spoliatosque secum\r\ntraheret, indignisque habuisset modis, de illorum nece agitare consilia\r\ncoepit. Satius denique illi visum ad eorum clementiam & humanitatem,\r\nquam in gravissimis injuriis perspexerat, confugere. Operam tamen\r\ndedit, ne intraret portum; sed stante in ancoris navigio, necessariam\r\nannonam immissâ scaphâ pararet. Contra quàm speraverat accidit. Secundo\r\nenim vento impulsus, portum quamlibet invitus reluctansque subiit.\r\nNostri de illo, quamvis non ita merito, ne verbum quidem ullum, quo\r\naccusaretur, interposuere: læti quod hostem ita servassent. Agnovit\r\nbeneficium gubernator Anglus; ac deinceps sæpenumero cum summa Patrum\r\nlaude prædicavit. Id vero multo fecit impensiùs, cùm tempestate ad\r\nAngliæ urbem Penbrochium projectus, ejus oppidi magistratibus movit\r\nsuspicionem maritimi latronis, quòd & Francicâ veheretur navi, neque\r\nscriptam auctoritatem proferret, qua suam navigationem tueretur.\r\nAsseveranti se à prætore suo Argallo tempestate divulsum, fides non\r\nhabebatur. In tanto discrimine sacerdotes duos Societatis testes\r\ncitavit, quos haberet in navi, & quorum incorrupta fides nemini\r\nvenire posset in dubium. Cum Patres interrogati rem ita se habere\r\nconfirmassent, periculo liberatus est. Reddidit quam debebat illorum\r\nhumanitati vicem; utque ipsis non solum esset impune, sed etiam ut\r\nà magistratu honor haberetur, curavit. Certior interim factus Regis\r\nChristianissimi orator de Patrum navigatione difficili, & in Angliam\r\nadventu, egit cum Angliæ Rege de remittendis illis in Galliam. Quo\r\nannuente, Ambianum decimo, quàm fuerant capti, mense ad Socios læti\r\nsospitesque pervenerunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY IS KILLED; THE OTHERS ARE EXPELLED\r\nFROM CANADA.\r\n\r\nIN THE FIRST onset, Gilbert du Thet, a household assistant of the\r\nSociety, was stricken with a mortal wound, and on the following day\r\npiously departed this life. The rest of the Fathers, who were standing\r\non the shore, were captured by Argall, the English commander.[63] This\r\nman, while he was taking an inventory of the plunder and equipment of\r\nthe French ship, surreptitiously removed from the trunk of Saussaye,\r\nthe captain of the French vessel, and commander of the expedition,\r\nthe royal commission upon whose authority all the proceedings of the\r\nnew colony were based. Soon meeting Saussaye himself, returning from\r\nthe shore, Argall asked him by what right, by whose authority, he\r\nwas founding a new colony so near Virginia. Saussaye cited the royal\r\ncommission, which he asserted that he had, duly drawn up, in one of his\r\ntrunks. When they came to these, he saw them untouched and locked, and\r\nall things disposed in their proper places; but no commission appeared.\r\nThereupon Argall, changing his countenance and voice to severity,\r\npronounced them runaways and pirates, and declared that they deserved\r\ndeath; while at the same time he delivered over the ship to his men to\r\nbe plundered. Meanwhile the Fathers besought him to adopt mild measures\r\ntoward the vanquished, against whom no other fault could be charged\r\nthan that, in a peaceful situation, they had been too careless; they\r\ntestified that the authority and favor of the King of France had\r\ncertainly been given to the colony. The captain, who was thoroughly\r\nconscious of the truth of their statements, listened to them kindly,\r\nand gave to all the opportunity of returning to France. The unhappy\r\ncrowd was placed upon two small ships, one of which directed its\r\ncourse straight towards France; the other, with some of the English,\r\nsailed for Virginia, thence to depart for France. Fathers Biard and\r\nQuentin embarked upon the latter; Father Massé and Saussaye upon the\r\nformer. The fortunes of these ships were widely diverse. While that\r\nwhich carried Saussaye and Father Massé was coasting along the shore,\r\ndestitute of provisions, of seamen, and of equipment, she fell upon\r\ntwo ships preparing to return to France. She gladly joined herself to\r\nthese, and, with her passengers, arrived in a few days at St. Malo, a\r\ntown of Brittany.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Argall, the commander of the English fleet, in order that\r\nhe might conduct Fathers Biard and Quentin to Virginia, as had been\r\nresolved upon, preceded them a little with his flag-ship. Virginia was\r\nthen ruled by a ferocious Englishman,[64] who was extremely hostile\r\nto the French name and to our Society. [325] When he heard that\r\nJesuits had arrived, he exclaimed that such extremely wicked men, the\r\nsepulchers of piety and religion, ought to be destroyed. Argall strove\r\nagainst him, and declared that, while he lived, no annoyance or injury\r\nshould be offered to the Fathers, for he had given them this assurance;\r\nand he produced the royal commission, by authority of which the French\r\ncolony was brought to New France. Incensed by this commission, the man\r\ndeclared in a rage that the French must be driven from New France. In\r\nthis decision the English councilors agreed. Argall was ordered to\r\nretrace his path; to expel those of the French who remained; to destroy\r\ntheir buildings, and level them with the ground. He returned, burned\r\nthe forts built upon the Canadian coast, destroyed everything, and\r\nseized two ships which he found at Port Royal.[65]\r\n\r\nWhile these things were taking place in Canada, of the English ships\r\nwhich were following the lead of Argall some were driven far from\r\nVirginia by the violence of the wind; others were swamped by the waves.\r\nOne, which the Englishman Turnell[66] commanded, and in which Fathers\r\nQuentin and Biard were being conveyed, after being driven continuously\r\nfor sixteen days by tempests, was quickly borne to the Azores, islands\r\non the coast of Africa belonging to the Portuguese. But here a new\r\ndanger arose. Turnell, fearing punishment because he was carrying with\r\nhim and was holding under unjust conditions priests of the Society, who\r\nhad been torn from their homes and robbed with the greatest brutality,\r\nbegan to consider plans for making way with them. Finally it seemed\r\nbetter to him to take refuge in their clemency and mildness, which he\r\nhad observed amid the most grievous injuries. Nevertheless, he took\r\nmeasures that they should not enter the port, thinking that while the\r\nship stood at anchor he might procure the necessary provisions by\r\nsending in a small boat. The contrary to what he had expected happened.\r\nFor, impelled by an inshore breeze, he entered the harbor, although\r\nunwillingly and reluctantly. Our friends, contrary to his deserts,\r\ninterposed not even a word by which he might be accused, rejoicing\r\nbecause they had, in this manner, saved an enemy. The English captain\r\nrecognized their kindness, and afterwards often spoke with great\r\npraise of the Fathers. But this he did much more unreservedly when,\r\nborne by a storm to Pembroke, a city of England, he was suspected by\r\nthe officials of that town of piracy on the high seas, because he was\r\nsailing in a French ship and produced no written authority by which he\r\nmight justify his voyage. When he asserted that he had been separated\r\nby a storm from his commander, Argall, no credence was given to him. In\r\nthis crisis he mentioned as witnesses the two priests of the Society\r\nwhom he had in the ship, and whose uncorrupted integrity could be\r\ndoubted by no one. When the Fathers, on being questioned, had given\r\nassurance that the affair was thus, he was released from danger. He\r\nmade the requital which was due to their kindness, and took care that\r\nthey should not only suffer no harm, but even that they should be shown\r\nhonor by the officials. Meantime the ambassador of the Most Christian\r\nKing, upon being informed of the toilsome voyage of the Fathers,\r\ncarried on negotiations with the King of England concerning their\r\nrestoration to France. With his consent, they arrived, in the tenth\r\nmonth after their capture, joyfully and safely among their Brethren at\r\nAmiens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nMissiones Societatis Iesv in America Septentrionali Anno M.DCC.X.

Unus ab indigenis Canada\r\nnominatus, & à quo tota regio nomen traxit, nunc fluvius Sancti\r\nLaurentii dicitur, & ab occasu in ortum amplissimo fluit alveo. Alter,\r\ncui nomen Missisipus, per vasta, & ignota magnam adhuc partem, terrarum\r\nspatia fertur à Septentrione in Meridiem. Habent hoc singulare hujus\r\nregionis fluvii, quòd certis in locis ex editiore solo præcipitant\r\nin humiliorem planitiem ingenti cum strepitu. Ea loca saltus vocant\r\nFranci. Catadupa recte dixeris, qualia in Nilo celebrantur. Aqua tota\r\nfluminis, in morem arcuati fornicis, ita sæpe cadit, ut infra suspensum\r\naltè amnem sicco vestigio transire liceat. Barbari, cum huc ventum\r\nest, suas naviculas, è levi compactas cortice, imponunt humeris, & in\r\nplacidam fluminis, alveo depressiore fluentis, partem eas deportant,\r\ncum sarcinulis. Urbs novæ Franciæ primaria Kebecum nuncupatur, S.\r\nLaurentii fluvio imposita. Coelo salubri tota regio utitur; at hyeme\r\nfrigida, & diuturna vexatur. Hanc efficit partim fluminum & lacuum\r\ncrebritas; partim opacitas & amplitudo nemorum, quæ vim solis calidam\r\ninfringunt; denique nivium copia, quibus terra tres quatuorve menses,\r\nin iis locis quæ ab Boream propius accedunt, & eidem ac vetus Gallia\r\nparallelo subjacent, continenter inhorrescit. Humus omnium arborum\r\nplantarumque feracissima, præsertim ubi excisæ silvæ locum culturæ\r\nmajorem præbuerunt. Quadrupedes eædem, quæ in Europa: nonnullæ regionis\r\npropriæ sunt, ut alces. Magnam belluam indigenæ appellant. Id nominis\r\ninvenit à mole corporis: bovem enim æquat magnitudine. Mulum capite\r\nrefert; cervum cornibus, pedibus, & cauda. Eam canibus immissis barbari\r\nagitant; defatigatam conficiunt jaculis & missilibus. Si desunt\r\nvenatici canes, ipsi vicem illorum obeunt. Per medias quippe nives\r\nincredibili celeritate gradiuntur, ac ne corporis pondus vestigia pedum\r\naltius in nivem deprimat, substernunt plantis, inseruntque pedibus,\r\nlata reticula, illis simillima, quibus pilam lusores vulgò pulsant. Hæc\r\nreticula, spatium nivis ac soli satis magnum amplexa, currentes facile\r\nsustinent. Alces vero crura exilia defigens alte in nivem, ægrè se\r\nexpedit. Illius carnibus vescuntur, teguntur pelle, ungula posterioris\r\nsinistri pedis sanantur. Huic ungulæ mira quædam & multiplex virtus\r\ninest, medicorum celeberrimorum testimonio commendata. Valet in primis\r\nadversus morbum comitialem, sive admoveatur pectori, qua parte cor\r\nmicat; sive indatur palæ annuli, quem digitus lævæ minimo proximus\r\ngestet; sive demum teneatur in ejusdem sinistræ vola, in pugnum\r\ncontracta. Nec minorem vim habet ad sanandam pleuritidem, capitis\r\nvertigines, & sexcentos alios, si credimus expertis, morbos.\r\n\r\nAlterum animantis genus illic notissimum & frequentissimum est fiber,\r\ncujus pelle, cum Europæis mercibus mutanda, commercii Canadensis ratio\r\nfere tota constat. Color castaneæ colorem imitatur; modus cor[po]ris\r\nidem, qui exigui vervecis: curti pedes & ad natandum compositi, nam\r\nin aquis perinde ac in terra degit; cauda glabra, crassa & plana,\r\nquæ natanti pro gubernaculo sit: dentes duo, majores ceteris, ex ore\r\nutrimque prominent: iis tanquam gladio & serra utuntur fibri ad arbores\r\nexscindendas, cum domos extruunt; in iis enim fabricandis mira pollent\r\nindustria. Eas ponunt ad lacuum fluviorumve ripas: muros è stipitibus\r\ncomponunt, interjecto cespite uliginoso ac tenaci, calcis instar; vix\r\nut multa vi effringi opus & convelli possit. Tota casæ fabrica variis\r\ncontignationibus distinguitur: infima è transversis lignis crassioribus\r\nconstat, instratis desuper ramis, ac relicto foramine & ostiolo,\r\nper quod in fluvium subire, cum videtur, possint: Hæc modice supra\r\nfluminis aquam exstat, aliæ assurgunt altius, in easque, si fluvius\r\nintumescens imum tabulatum vicerit, se receptant. In una è superioribus\r\ncontignationibus cubant; præbet molle stratum alga siccior, & arborum\r\nmuscus, quo se tutantur a frigore; in altera penum habent, & provisa\r\nin hyemem cibaria. Ædificium fornicato tecto clauditur. Sic hyemem\r\nexigunt: nam æstate, opacum in ripis frigus captant, aut undis immersi\r\ncalores æstivos fugiunt. In una sæpe domo ingens, & multorum capitum\r\nfamilia stabulatur. Quod si loci premuntur angustiis, discedunt\r\njuniores ultro, & sua sibi domicilia moliuntur. In eam curam incumbunt\r\nsub prima autumni frigora, & mutuas sibi invicem operas commodant,\r\ntum ad secanda ligna, tum ad comportanda, ita ut plures uni eidemque\r\nsuccedant oneri, & ingentia ramalia, nemorisque stragem, devehant. Si\r\nquem fluvium nanciscuntur ad suos accommodatum usus, non tamen satis\r\nalto gurgite, struunt aggerem coercendis aquis, donec ad idoneam\r\naltitudinem assurgant. Ac primo quidem arbores grandiores arrodendo\r\ndejiciunt: deinde transversas ab una ripa ducunt ad alteram. Duplicem\r\nversum & ordinem arborum faciunt; relicto inter illas obliquè sic\r\npositas spatio sex fere pedum, quod referciunt cæmentis, argilla,\r\nramis, tam solerter, nihil ut perfectius à summo architecto expectes.\r\nOperis longitudo major minorve est, pro fluvii, quem coercere volunt,\r\nmodo. Ducenûm aliquando passuum ejusmodi aggeres reperti. At, si amnis\r\nplus justo intumescit, diffringunt aliquam molis partem, ac tantum\r\nemittunt aquæ, quantum satis videtur.\r\n\r\nUt feris silvæ, sic piscibus abundant flumina. Unus est in Iroquæorum\r\nlacu, de quo nihil à priscis legitur proditum scriptoribus. Causarus\r\nab indigenis vocatur: octo pedes longus, aliquando decem. Crassitudo,\r\nhumani femoris; color leucophæus, candido tamen propior; squamis\r\ntotus horret tam duris, tamque validè consertis, ut aciem pugionis, &\r\nhastilium, excludant. Caput amplum, & cranio præduro, tanquam casside,\r\nmunitum. Hinc piscis armati nomen illi à Gallis inditum. Et vero\r\nperpetua cum aliis piscibus bella gerit, quorum exitio pascitur. Pro\r\ntelo rostrum immane gerit, humani brachii longitudine, gemino dentium\r\nordine instructum. Hoc venabulo non solum reliquos mactat pisces,\r\nverum etiam avibus, cum mutare dapes cupit, insidiatur & illudit. Eam\r\nob rem occultat se inter carecta: rostrum exertat aquis, ac paulisper\r\ndiducit. Sic perstat immotus donec accedant volucres, & incautæ rostro\r\ninsideant, arundinem aut virgultum ratæ: continuo perfidus insidiator,\r\nmisellarum pedes contracto rostro stringit, & in gurgitem demersas\r\nvorat.\r\n\r\nNon minor volucrum est copia, quàm piscium. Certis mensibus palumbes è\r\nsilvis prorumpunt in agros tanto numero, ut arborum ramos prægravent;\r\nquibus postquam infederunt noctu, facile capiuntur, & barbaras mensas\r\nregali ferculo cumulant. Præterea in vastissimo sinu, in quem evolvit\r\nse flumen sancti Laurentii, cernitur exigua insula, seu potius\r\nbiceps scopulus: insulam volucrum dicunt. Tot enim eò convolant è\r\nfinitimo pelago, ut inire numerum nequeas. Indigenæ fustibus prædam\r\nnon difficilem comminuunt, aut pedibus conculcant; cymbasque lautis\r\ndapibus, & inemptis [345] plenas referunt. Ludunt in aquis passim\r\nanseres, anates, ardeæ, grues, olores, fulicæ; & aves aliæ, victum ex\r\nundis petere solitæ. Peculiare quiddam habet una, gallinæ similis, si\r\nmolem spectes; pennis in tergo nigricantibus, sub alvo candidis. Pedum\r\nalter unguibus aduncis armatur; alter digitos levi & continua pelle\r\njunctos habet, qualis est anatum; hoc natat; illo pisces trahit &\r\neviscerat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[344 § x.] Concerning the country and manners of the Savages of New\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nRIVERS OF NEW FRANCE; NATURE OF THE SOIL; WILD BEASTS, FISH, BIRDS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are two great rivers in New France. One, called by the natives\r\nCanada, a name thence extended to the whole country, is now called the\r\nriver St. Lawrence, and flows in a very broad channel from west to\r\neast. The other, named Mississippi, flows from North to South, through\r\nvast regions, for the most part still unknown. The rivers of this\r\nland are remarkable because in certain places they are precipitated\r\nwith a great uproar from the higher to the lower levels. The French\r\ncall those places water-falls. You might justly call them cataracts,\r\nsuch as are famous in the case of the Nile. The water of an entire\r\nriver often falls in the form of an arch, in such fashion that it is\r\npossible to walk dry-shod beneath the stream which rushes overhead. The\r\nsavages, when they come to such a spot, shoulder their boats, which are\r\nconstructed of light bark, and carry them, together with the baggage,\r\nto the calm portion of the river flowing below. The chief city of new\r\nFrance is called Kebec, and is situated on the St. Lawrence river. The\r\nwhole country possesses a healthful climate, but is harassed by a cold\r\nand long winter. This is caused partly by the frequency of the rivers\r\nand lakes; partly by the thickness and great extent of the forests,\r\nwhich diminish the force of the sun's heat; finally, by the abundance\r\nof snow with which the land, in its most Northern regions, which lie\r\nupon the same parallel as old France, is continually desolated for\r\nthree or four months. The soil is extremely productive of all sorts\r\nof trees and plants, especially where the clearing of the forest has\r\nfurnished additional space for cultivation. The same quadrupeds are\r\nfound as in Europe; some, as the moose, are peculiar to the country.\r\nThe natives call it the \"great beast.\" This name it receives because\r\nof the huge size of its body, for it is as large as an ox. Its head\r\nresembles that of a mule; its horns, hoofs, and tail, those of a stag.\r\nThe savages hunt this animal with the aid of dogs; when it is worn\r\nout they dispatch it with spears and missiles. If hunting-dogs are\r\nlacking, they themselves go in place of them. Indeed, they proceed\r\nthrough the midst of the snow with incredible swiftness; and, in order\r\nthat the weight of the body may not sink their feet too deeply into the\r\nsnow, they place beneath their soles, and fasten to their feet, broad\r\npieces of net-work, very similar to those with which players commonly\r\nstrike the ball. These pieces of net-work, which cover a sufficiently\r\nlarge portion of the surface of the snow, readily support them while\r\nrunning. But the moose, planting their slender legs deeply into the\r\nsnow, with difficulty extricate themselves. The savages eat its flesh,\r\nare clothed with its skin, and are cured by the hoof of its left hind\r\nleg. In this hoof there is a certain marvelous and manifold virtue, as\r\nis affirmed by the testimony of the most famous physicians. It avails\r\nespecially against the epilepsy, whether it be applied to the breast,\r\nwhere the heart is throbbing, or whether it be placed in the bezel of\r\na ring, which is worn upon the finger next to the little finger of the\r\nleft hand; or, finally, if it be also held in the hollow of the left\r\nhand, clenched in the fist. Nor does it have less power in the cure of\r\npleurisy, dizziness, and, if we may believe those familiar with it, six\r\nhundred other diseases.\r\n\r\nAnother well-known and common sort of animal there, is the beaver; its\r\nskins, which are exchanged for European merchandise, being the basis\r\nof almost the entire system of Canadian commerce. Its color resembles\r\nthat of the chestnut; the shape of its body is like that of a small\r\nwether; its legs are short and formed for swimming; its tail, which\r\nit uses as a rudder while swimming, is smooth, thick and flat; two\r\nteeth, larger than the others, project from its mouth on each side;\r\nthese, the beavers use like a sword and a saw in cutting down trees\r\nwhen they build their houses, for in the construction of these they\r\nexhibit wonderful industry. They locate them on the banks of lakes\r\nor rivers; they build walls of logs, placing between them wet and\r\nsticky sods in the place of mortar, so that the work can, even with\r\ngreat violence, scarcely be torn apart and destroyed. The entire house\r\nis divided into several stories; the lowest is composed of thicker\r\ncross-beams, with branches strewn upon them, and provided with a hole\r\nor small door through which they can pass into the river whenever they\r\nwish; this story extends somewhat above the water of the river, while\r\nthe others rise higher, into which they retire if the swelling stream\r\nsubmerges the lowest floor. They sleep in one of the upper stories; a\r\nsoft bed is furnished by dry seaweed and tree moss, with which they\r\nprotect themselves from the cold; on another floor they have their\r\nstore-room, and food provided for winter. The building is covered with\r\na dome-shaped roof. Thus they pass the winter, for in summer they\r\nenjoy the shady coolness upon the shores, or escape the summer heat\r\nby plunging into the water. Often a great colony of many members is\r\nlodged in one house. But, if they be incommoded by the narrowness of\r\nthe place, the younger ones depart of their own accord and construct\r\nhomes for themselves. Upon the advent of cool weather in autumn, they\r\ndevote themselves to this task, and lend mutual services in turn, both\r\nin cutting and carrying logs, so that many assist at one and the same\r\nburden, and thus carry down great branches and logs of forest trees.\r\nIf they find any river suitable for their purposes, except in having\r\nsufficient depth, they build a dam to keep back the water until it\r\nrises to the required height. And first, by gnawing them, they fell\r\ntrees of large size; then they lay them across, from one shore to the\r\nother. They construct a double barrier and rampart of logs, obliquely\r\nplaced, leaving between them a space of about six feet, which they so\r\ningeniously fill in with stones, clay, and branches that one would\r\nexpect nothing better from the most skillful architect. The length of\r\nthe structure is greater or less, according to the size of the stream\r\nwhich they wish to restrain. Dams of this kind a fifth of a mile long\r\nare sometimes found. But, if the river swell more than is safe, they\r\nbreak open some part of the structure, and let through as much water as\r\nseems sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs the forests abound in wild beasts, so the rivers teem with fish.\r\nThere is one in the lake of the Iroquois,[67] which is not mentioned\r\nby early authors. It is called by the natives \"Causar,\" and is eight\r\nfeet long, sometimes ten. It is as thick as the human thigh; it is\r\ndun-colored, approaching white; it bristles all over with scales,\r\nso hard and so firmly set together that they turn the edge of a\r\nknife or the point of a spear. The head is large, and protected by an\r\nexceedingly hard skull, like a helmet. Hence, the name of \"armored\r\nfish\" has been given it by the French. It carries on perpetual war\r\nwith, and feeds upon, other fishes. For a weapon it carries an immense\r\nbeak, of the length of a man's arm and furnished with a double row\r\nof teeth. With this hunting-spear it not only devours other fishes,\r\nbut also, whenever it wishes to vary its diet, deceives and ensnares\r\nbirds. For this latter purpose it hides itself among the sedge; it\r\nprojects its beak from the water and opens it slightly. It thus remains\r\nmotionless until the birds approach and thoughtlessly perch upon the\r\nbeak, deeming it a reed or a bush; then the treacherous ensnarer seizes\r\nthe feet of the unfortunate birds by closing its beak, and, dragging\r\nthem into the water, devours them.[68]\r\n\r\nThe birds are fully as abundant as the fishes. During certain months\r\nof the year the pigeons sally forth from the woods into the open\r\ncountry in such great numbers that they overload the branches of the\r\ntrees. When they have settled upon the trees at night they are easily\r\ncaptured, and the savages heap their tables with royal abundance.\r\nBesides this, in the huge gulf into which the river saint Lawrence\r\nflows may be seen a small island, or rather a double rock; they call\r\nit the isle of birds.[69] For so many congregate there from the\r\nneighboring ocean that it is impossible to count their numbers. The\r\nnatives make an easy prey of them with clubs, or by trampling them\r\nunder foot, and bring back their canoes filled with sumptuous food\r\nacquired without price. [345] Everywhere may be seen, sporting in the\r\nwater, geese, ducks, herons, cranes, swans, coots and other birds\r\nwhose habit it is to seek their living from the waves. A certain\r\npeculiarity attaches to one, which is about the size of a cock; its\r\nwings are black on the outside and white beneath. One of its feet\r\nis armed with hooked claws, the other has webbed toes, like those\r\nof a duck; with the latter it swims, with the former it seizes and\r\ndisembowels fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADENSIUM DOMUS & RES FAMILIARIS; MORBI; ÆGRORUM CURA & MORTUORUM.\r\n\r\nJAM, si mores & indolem gentis requiras, partim vagi degunt, in silvis\r\nper hyemem, quò venationis uberioris vocat spes; æstate, ad amnium\r\nripas, ubi præbet facilem annonam piscatus: aliqui pagos incolunt.\r\nCasas fabricantur infixis humi perticis: latera corticibus intexunt;\r\npellibus, musco, ramis operiunt fastigia. In media casa focus: in summo\r\ntecto foramen, emissarium fumi. Is ægre eluctatus totam, ut plurimum,\r\ncasam sic opplet, ut coactis habitare in hoc fumo advenis sæpe oculorum\r\nacies obtundatur, & hebescat: barbari, durum genus & his assuetum\r\nincommodis, rident. Domesticæ rei cura, & quidquid in familia laboris\r\nest, imponitur feminis. Illæ domos figunt, ac refigunt; aquam, & ligna\r\ndevehunt, cibos apparant: vicem & locum mancipiorum, opificum, &\r\njumentorum, implent. Venationis & belli cura, virorum est. Hinc gentis\r\nsolitudo, & paucitas. Mulieres enim, ceteroquin haud infecundæ, his\r\ndistrictæ laboribus, neque maturos edere queunt fetus, neque alere jam\r\neditos: itaque aut abortum patiuntur, aut partus recentes destituunt,\r\naquationi, lignationi, ceterisque operibus intentæ; vix ut trigesimus\r\nquisque infans adolescat. Accedit rei medicæ inscitia, cujus ignoratio\r\nfacit ut è morbis paulo gravioribus raro emergant.\r\n\r\nDuos maximè fontes morborum statuunt: unum ex ipsa ægrotantis mente\r\nortum, quæ desideret quidpiam, ac tandiu corpus ægrum vexet, dum\r\nre desiderata potiatur. Putant enim inesse in hominum unoquoque\r\ninnata quædam desideria, sæpe ipsis ignota, quibus singulorum\r\nfelicitas contineatur. Ad ejusmodi desideria & innatas appetitiones\r\ncognoscendas adhibent hariolos, quibus hanc divinitus concessam\r\nfacultatem arbitrantur, ut animorum intimos recessus pervideant. Illi,\r\nquodcumque primum occurrit, aut ex quo fieri quæstum aliquem posse\r\nsuspicantur, ab ægro desiderari pronunciant. Nec dubitant parentes,\r\namici, & consanguinei ægrotantis, quidquid illud sit, quantivis\r\npretii, comparare ac largiri ægro, nunquam postea reposcendum. Ille\r\ndono fruitur, & lucri partem hariolis aspergit; ac sæpe postridie\r\nvita cedit. Vulgo tamen relevantur ægroti, quippe levibus tentati\r\nmorbis: nam in gravioribus timidiores sunt isti præstigiatores,\r\nnegantque inveniri posse quid ægrotus desideret: tunc eum depositum\r\nconclamant, auctoresque sunt consanguineis ut hominem tollant è medio.\r\nIta longiore morbo vexatos necant, aut senio fessos; eamque caritatem\r\nsummam interpretantur, quia mors ærumnis languentium finem ponit.\r\nEandem benevolentiam adhibent erga pueros parentibus orbatos, quos\r\nnullos esse malunt, quam miseros. Alterum fontem morborum esse censent\r\nveneficorum occultas artes, & præstigias, quas ridiculis cærimoniis\r\nconantur averruncare. Sæpe noxios humores ejiciunt sudando. Certum\r\ncasæ locum corticibus includunt, ac tegunt pellibus, ne qua possit aer\r\naspirare. Intro congerunt lapides deustos & igne multo saturos. Subeunt\r\nnudi & brachia cantitantes jactant. Sed, quod mireris, ab his thermis\r\negressi & sudore diffluentes, hyeme perfrigida, in lacum aut amnem se\r\nconjiciunt, de pleuritide securi.\r\n\r\nMortuorum cadavera nunquam efferunt per casæ januam, sed per eam\r\npartem, in quam conversus eger exspiravit. Animam putant evolare per\r\ncamini spiraculum; ac ne moras trahat, casæ pristinæ desiderio, neu\r\npuerulorum aliquem discedens afflet, hoc afflatu videlicet moriturum,\r\nut putant; crebro fuste tundunt parietes tugurii, ut eam citius\r\nexire compellant. Immortalem esse arbitrantur. Ne porro emoriatur\r\nfame, magnam vim ciborum infodiunt cum corpore; vestes, item, ollas,\r\nvariamque supellectilem, magno sumptu, & multorum annorum labore\r\nconquisitam, ut iis utatur, inquiunt, ac decentius versetur in regno\r\nmortuorum. Sepulcra nobilium exstant paulum ab humo: iis perticas in\r\nmorem pyramidis compactas imponunt: arcum addunt, sagittas, clypeum,\r\n& alia militiæ decora: feminarum vero tumulis, torques & monilia.\r\nInfantium corpora sepeliunt propter viam, ut eorum anima, quam ab\r\nipsorum corporibus abire longius non putant, illabatur in prætereuntis\r\nalicujus feminæ sinum, & adhuc informem animare fetum possit. In luctu\r\nvultum inficiunt fuligine. Moniti de funere affines, vicini, & amici\r\nconcurrunt in funestum tugurium. Unus aliquis, si mortui conditio\r\nferat, verba facit, neque rationem ullam ex iis prætermittit, quæ ad\r\nleniendam ægritudinem à dicendi magistris afferri solent. Excurrit in\r\ndemortui laudes: hominem eum natum fuisse admonet, atque adeo morti\r\nobnoxium: qui casus emendari nequeant, fieri patientia leviores; alia\r\nid genus in eandem sententiam edisserit. Tertio die funus ducitur.\r\nEpulum funebre apponitur toti pago, singulis suam symbolam, nec\r\nmalignè, conferentibus. Hujus epuli causas afferunt maximè tres:\r\nprimam, ut communem mærorem leniant: alteram, ut qui amici peregrè\r\nad funus veniunt, accipiantur honestius: tertiam, ut gratificentur\r\nextincti Manibus, quem ea liberalitate delectari existimant, &\r\nappositis etiam dapibus pasci. Peracto convivio præfectus funeris, quem\r\nin singulis familiis clarioribus, certum atque insignem habent, adesse\r\ntempus exequiarum proclamat. Omnes continuo lamentari, & ululare.\r\nEffertur cadaver propinquorum humeris, intectum fibrinis pellibus, & in\r\nferetro, è corticibus juncisve confecto compositum, collectis in glomum\r\nartubus, ut eo modo terræ mandetur, inquiunt, quo in alvo materna olim\r\njacuit. Deponitur feretrum in constituto loco, munera quæ quisque\r\noffert mortuo, præfiguntur perticis: & appellantur illorum auctores\r\nà funeris præfecto: instauratur planctus; denique juvenes ludicro\r\ncertamine inter se dimicant.\r\n\r\nMajori sepeliuntur apparatu & luctu, qui aquis obruti perierunt.\r\nNam eorum cadavera laniantur: carnium pars cum visceribus in ignem\r\nprojicitur. Id sacrificii quoddam genus est, quo placare coelum\r\ncontendunt. Iratum enim esse genti non dubitant, cum in undis\r\nquispiam extinguitur: ac si quid rite atque ordine peractum in istis\r\nfuneribus non fuerit, huic piaculo calamitates omnes, quibus postea\r\nconflictantur, acceptas ferunt. Indulgent luctui per annum integrum.\r\nPrimis diebus decem jacent humi, diu noctuque in ventrem proni: nefas\r\ntunc vocem ullam, nisi quæ dolorem significet, mittere; aut accedere\r\nad ignem, aut conviviis interesse. Anno reliquo luctus continuatur; at\r\nlevius. Omittuntur omnia urbanitatis officia, colloquia cum vicinis,\r\ncongressus amicorum; ac si conjugem amiserint; coelibes, donec annus\r\nfluxerit, perstant. Post octavum aut decimum quemque annum Hurones,\r\nquæ natio latè patet, omnia cadavera certum in locum ex omnibus pagis\r\ndeportant, & in foveam prægrandem conjiciunt. Eum diem Mortuorum\r\nvocant. Is ubi de procerum sententia constitutus est, eruunt corpora\r\nsepulcris; alia jam consumpta, & ossibus vix hærentia; alia putri carne\r\nleviter amicta: alia scatentia foedis vermibus, & graviter olentia.\r\nOssa, dissoluta in saccos abdunt: cadavera nondum dissuta componunt\r\nin sarcophagis, & supplicantium ritu deferunt in destinatum locum,\r\nalto silentio, & composito gradu procedentes, non sine suspiriis,\r\n& lamentabili eiulatu. Ne vero memoria nobilium, & arte præsertim\r\nbellica insignium, qui prole carent, intercidat, eligunt aliquem\r\nætate ac robore florentem, cui demortui nomen imponunt. Ille militum\r\nstatim delectum habet, ac bellum capessit, ut præclaro quopiam edito\r\nfacinore, probet se non tantum nominis, sed etiam virtutis ejus, cui\r\nsubstituitur, heredem esse. Inferioris notæ nomina æterno silentio\r\ndamnant. Itaque simul ac in pago quispiam è vita cessit, ejus nomen\r\nalta voce pronunciatur per omnes casas, ne quis illud temere usurpet.\r\nQuod si mortuum tamen appellare necesse fuerit, utuntur verborum\r\ncircuitione, & præfantur quidpiam, quo mortis ominosa [346] memoria\r\nleniatur. Idque si omittatur, accipiunt in gravem contumeliam: neque\r\natrociori maledicto vulnerari filium aut parentem posse putant, quam si\r\nhuic filius, illi parens, mortuus exprobretur.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMES AND HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY OF THE CANADIANS; DISEASES; TREATMENT OF\r\nTHE SICK AND OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nNOW, if you inquire concerning the customs and character of this\r\npeople, I will reply that a part of them are nomads, wandering during\r\nthe winter in the woods, whither the hope of better hunting calls\r\nthem--in the summer, on the shores of the rivers, where they easily\r\nobtain their food by fishing; while others inhabit villages. They\r\nconstruct their huts by fixing poles in the ground; they cover the\r\nsides with bark, the roofs with hides, moss and branches. In the\r\nmiddle of the hut is the hearth, from which the smoke escapes through\r\nan opening at the peak of the roof. As the smoke passes out with\r\ndifficulty, it usually fills the whole hut, so that strangers compelled\r\nto live in these cabins suffer injury and weakening of the eyes; the\r\nsavages, a coarse race, and accustomed to these discomforts, ridicule\r\nthis. The care of household affairs, and whatever work there may be\r\nin the family, are placed upon the women. They build and repair the\r\nwigwams, carry water and wood, and prepare the food; their duties\r\nand position are those of slaves, laborers and beasts of burden.\r\nThe pursuits of hunting and war belong to the men. Thence arise the\r\nisolation and numerical weakness of the race. For the women, although\r\nnaturally prolific, cannot, on account of their occupation in these\r\nlabors, either bring forth fully-developed offspring, or properly\r\nnourish them after they have been brought forth; therefore they either\r\nsuffer abortion, or forsake their new-born children, while engaged\r\nin carrying water, procuring wood and other tasks, so that scarcely\r\none infant in thirty survives until youth. To this there is added\r\ntheir ignorance of medicine, because of which they seldom recover from\r\nillnesses which are at all severe.\r\n\r\nThey believe that there are two main sources of disease: one of these\r\nis in the mind of the patient himself, which desires something,\r\nand will vex the body of the sick man until it possesses the thing\r\nrequired. For they think that there are in every man certain inborn\r\ndesires, often unknown to themselves, upon which the happiness of\r\nindividuals depends. For the purpose of ascertaining desires and innate\r\nappetites of this character, they summon soothsayers, who, as they\r\nthink, have a divinely-imparted power to look into the inmost recesses\r\nof the mind. These men declare that whatever first occurs to them, or\r\nsomething from which they suspect some gain can be derived, is desired\r\nby the sick person. Thereupon the parents, friends, and relatives of\r\nthe patient do not hesitate to procure and lavish upon him whatever it\r\nmay be, however expensive, a return of which is never thereafter to be\r\nsought. The patient enjoys the gift, divides a portion of it among the\r\nsoothsayers, and often on the next day departs from life. Commonly,\r\nhowever, the sick recover, plainly because their illnesses are slight;\r\nfor, in the case of more severe complaints, these soothsayers are more\r\ncautious, and deny the possibility of ascertaining what the patient\r\ndesires; then they bewail him whom they have given up, and cause the\r\nrelatives to put him out of the way. Thus they kill those afflicted\r\nwith protracted illness, or exhausted by old age, and consider this the\r\ngreatest kindness, because death puts an end to the sufferings of\r\nthe sick. They display the same benevolence towards children deprived\r\nof their parents, whom they prefer to see dead rather than to see them\r\nmiserable. They believe that another source of disease is the hidden\r\narts and the charms of sorcerers, which they seek to avert by means\r\nof absurd ceremonies. Often they expel noxious humors by sweating.\r\nThey inclose a certain portion of the hut with pieces of bark and\r\ncover it with hides, in order that no air may enter. Within they pile\r\nstones heated to a high temperature. They enter naked and toss their\r\narms while singing. But, strange to say, they will leave this heat,\r\ndripping with perspiration, and in the very coldest part of winter cast\r\nthemselves into a lake or river, careless of pleurisy.\r\n\r\nThey never bear out the corpses of the dead through the door of the\r\nlodge, but through that part toward which the sick person turned when\r\nhe expired. They think that the soul flies out through the smoke-hole;\r\nand, in order that it may not linger through longing for its old home,\r\nnor while departing breathe upon any of the children, who by such an\r\nact would be, as they think, doomed to death, they beat the walls of\r\nthe wigwam with frequent blows of a club, in order that they may compel\r\nthe soul to depart more quickly. They believe it to be immortal. That\r\nit may not thereafter perish with hunger, they bury with the body\r\na large quantity of provisions; also, garments, pots, and various\r\nutensils of great expense, and acquired by many years' labor, in order,\r\nthey say, that he may use them and pass his time more suitably in\r\nthe kingdom of the dead. The tombs of the chiefs are raised a little\r\nfrom the ground; upon them they place poles joined in the form of\r\na pyramid; they add a bow, arrows, shield and other insignia of war;\r\nbut upon the tombs of the women they place necklaces and collars.\r\nThey bury the bodies of infants beside paths, in order that their\r\nsouls, which they think do not depart very far from the body, may slip\r\ninto the bosoms of women passing by, and animate the yet undeveloped\r\nfetus. In mourning, they stain the face with soot. When informed of\r\na death, the relatives, neighbors, and friends assemble at the lodge\r\nwhere the corpse lies. If the condition of the dead permit, one of\r\nthem makes a speech, in which he employs all those arguments that the\r\nmost eloquent speakers are wont to use for the solace of grief. He\r\nrehearses the praises of the dead; he reminds them that the latter\r\nwas born a man, and therefore liable to death; that those misfortunes\r\nwhich cannot be repaired are made lighter by patience; he sets forth\r\nother things of that sort to the same effect. On the third day the\r\nfuneral is held. A funeral feast is provided for the whole village,\r\neach individual liberally furnishing his share. For this feast they\r\nadvance three main reasons: first, that they may assuage the general\r\ngrief; secondly, that those friends who come from a distance to the\r\nfuneral may be more fittingly entertained; thirdly, that they may\r\nplease the spirit of the dead, which, they believe, is delighted by\r\nthis exhibition of liberality, and also partakes of the repast placed\r\nfor him. When the feast is completed the master of the funeral, who, in\r\neach distinguished family, permanently holds this office and is greatly\r\nhonored, proclaims that the time for the burial has come. All give\r\nutterance to continuous lamentations and wailings. The corpse, wrapped\r\nin beaver skins, and placed upon a bier made of bark and rushes, with\r\nhis limbs bent and pressed tightly against his body in order that,\r\nas they say, he may be committed to the earth in the same position in\r\nwhich he once lay in his mother's womb, is borne out on the shoulders\r\nof the relatives. The bier is set down at the appointed place, the\r\ngifts which each one offers to the dead are fastened to poles, and the\r\ndonors are named by the master of the funeral. The mourning is renewed;\r\nfinally, boys vie with each other in a mock contest.\r\n\r\nThose who have been drowned are buried with greater ceremony and\r\nlamentation. For their bodies are cut open, and a portion of the flesh,\r\ntogether with the viscera, thrown into the fire. This is a sort of\r\nsacrifice, by means of which they seek to appease heaven. For they are\r\nsure that heaven is enraged against the race whenever any one loses\r\nhis life by drowning. If any part of these funeral rites has not been\r\nduly and regularly performed, they believe that all the calamities from\r\nwhich they afterwards may suffer are a punishment for this neglect.\r\nThey indulge their grief throughout an entire year. For the first ten\r\ndays they lie upon the ground day and night, flat upon their bellies;\r\nit is impious then to utter any sound unless significant of grief, or\r\nto approach the fire, or to take part in feasts. During the remainder\r\nof the year the mourning continues, but less vigorously. All the\r\nduties of politeness, conversation with neighbors, and association\r\nwith friends, are neglected; and, if a man has lost a wife he remains\r\nunmarried until the year has expired. Every eight or ten years the\r\nHurons, which nation is widely extended, convey all their corpses from\r\nall the villages to a designated place and cast them into an immense\r\npit. They call it the day of the Dead. When this has been decreed\r\nby resolution of the elders, they drag out the corpses from their\r\ngraves, some already decomposed, with flesh scarcely clinging to the\r\nbones, others thinly covered with putrid flesh, others teeming with\r\nvile worms and smelling fearfully. The loose bones they place in sacks,\r\nthe bodies not yet disintegrated they place in coffins, and bear them,\r\nin the manner of suppliants, to the appointed place, proceeding amid\r\ndeep silence and with regular step, uttering sighs and mournful cries.\r\nBut, in order that the memory of chiefs and of those especially famous\r\nin the art of war, who lack offspring, may not fail, they choose\r\nsome person in the flower of his age and strength, to whom they give\r\nthe name of the dead man. The namesake immediately makes a levy of\r\nwarriors and starts for battle, in order that by the achievement of\r\nsome glorious deed he may prove himself the heir not only of the name\r\nbut also of the valor of him whose place he has taken. Names of lesser\r\nnote are condemned to everlasting silence. Therefore, as soon as any\r\none in the village has departed this life his name is proclaimed in a\r\nloud voice throughout all the lodges, in order that no one may rashly\r\nuse it. But if, nevertheless, it be necessary to name the dead man,\r\nthey use a circumlocution and preface something by which the unpleasant\r\n[346] recollection of his death may be softened. If that be omitted\r\nthey consider it a deadly insult: nor do they think that son or parent\r\ncan be wounded by more savage abuse than when their dead relatives are\r\ndefamed before them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLI GERENDI RATIO; ARMA; CRUDELITAS IN CAPTIVOS.\r\n\r\nBELLA temere ac ferociter suscipiunt, nulla sæpe, aut perlevi de causa.\r\nDuces communi suffragio legunt, eosque vel familiarum præcipuarum natu\r\nmaximos, vel quorum virtus bellica, aut etiam eloquentia perspecta\r\nsit. Civili bello nunquam inter se concurrunt; arma in finitimos\r\ntantum movent; neque imperii ac ditionis proferendæ causa, sed ferè ut\r\nillatam sibi, vel foederatis, injuriam ulciscantur. Gladios, & gravidas\r\nnitrato pulvere fistulas, à Batavis & Anglis accepere, quibus armis\r\nfreti, certiùs & audacius in hostium, atque adeò Europæorum perniciem\r\nconspirant. Interdum bella singulari certamine finiunt. Agmina duo,\r\nhinc Montanorum, quos vocant, inde Iroquæorum constiterant ante\r\naliquot annos, velut in procinctu. Duces antegressi jam designabant\r\nlocum ad aciem explicandam, cum unus alterum sic allocutus fertur:\r\nParcamus nostrorum sanguini, imo nostro: manibus nudis rem agamus. Uter\r\nalterum dejecerit, is vincat. Placuit conditio. Manus ambo conferunt.\r\nMontanus Iroquæum ita delassavit, dolum artemque virtuti miscens, ut\r\nhumi denique prostratum ligaverit, impositumque humeris ad suum agmen\r\nvictor detulerit. Clypeos conficiunt è ligno dolato, plerumque cedrino;\r\npaulum ad oras incurvos: leves, prælongos & peramplos, ita ut totum\r\ncorpus protegant. Jam, ne jaculis, aut securibus perrumpantur omnino ac\r\ndissiliant, eos intus consuunt restibus ex animalium corio contextis,\r\nquæ totam clypei molem continent connectuntque. Non gestant è brachio\r\nsuspensos, sed funem ex quo pendent, rejiciunt in humerum dextrum:\r\nadeo ut latus corporis sinistrum clypeo protegatur; mox ubi jaculum\r\nemiserunt, aut ferream disploserunt fistulam, paulum retrahunt dextrum\r\nlatus, ac sinistrum clypeo tectum obvertunt hosti.\r\n\r\nIn prælio id maximè student, vivos ut hostes capiant. Captis & in suos\r\nabductis pagos primum vestes detrahunt; deinde ungues crudis dentibus\r\nsingillatim avellunt: tum palo alligatos verberant ad satietatem. Mox\r\nvinculis solutos cogunt ire, ac redire, geminum inter ordinem armatorum\r\nspinis, fustibus & ferramentis. Denique, accenso circum foco, lentis\r\nignibus miseros torrent. Interim torosas carnes fodicant candentibus\r\nlaminis, & verubus, aut recisas ac semiustulatas, sanie fluentes &\r\nsanguine, vorant. Nunc tædis ardentibus totum corpus, ac præsertim\r\nhiatus vulnerum, pertentant: nunc detracta capitis cute inspergunt\r\nnudæ calvæ favillam, & fervidos cineres: nunc brachiorum nervos ac\r\npedum vellunt, lancinant, aut hebeti secant lente ferro, derepta\r\nparumper cute, in pedis malleolo, & manus carpo. Sæpe cogunt captivum\r\ninfelicem ingredi per subjectos ignes: aut frusta suæ carnis mandere,\r\nac vivo sepulcro condere. Hujusmodi carnificinam non pauci è Patribus\r\nSocietatis pertulere. Hanc porro extrahunt in multos dies; utque novis\r\ncruciatibus tristis victima suppetat, intermittunt eosdem aliquandiu,\r\ndonec ad extremum fatiscant corpora, & concidant. Tunc è pectore cor\r\navellunt, torrent subjectis prunis; & cruore condîtum juvenibus avidè\r\ncomedendum objiciunt, si captivus suppliciorum acerbitatem generosè\r\nfuerit perpessus: ut viri fortis, inquiunt, masculum robur juventus\r\nbellatrix combibat. Laudatur qui rogum, cultros, vulnera, irretorto\r\nvultu aspexerit, & exceperit: qui non ingemuerit, qui risu cantuque\r\ntortoribus illuserit: nam canere tot inter mortes, amplum ac magnificum\r\nesse putant. Itaque cantilenas ipsi multo ante componunt, quas capti,\r\nsi sors ferat, recitent. Reliqua multitudo cadaver absumit in ferali\r\nconvivio. Dux reservat sibi verticis pellem cum coma, monumentum\r\nvictoriæ, trophæum crudelitatis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF WARFARE; WEAPONS; CRUELTY TO PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nTHEY engage in war rashly and savagely, often with no cause, or upon a\r\nvery slight pretext. They choose as leaders, by general vote, either\r\nthe eldest members of illustrious families or those whose warlike\r\nvalor, or even eloquence, has been approved. In civil war they never\r\nengage; they carry arms only against their neighbors, and not for the\r\nsake of extending their dominion and sway, but usually, in order that\r\nthey may avenge an injury inflicted upon themselves or their allies.\r\nThey have obtained swords and guns from the Dutch and English, and,\r\nrelying upon these weapons, they plan with greater determination and\r\nboldness the destruction of their enemies, and even of the Europeans.\r\nSometimes they decide their wars by single combat. Two bands, one of\r\nthe so-called Montagnais,[70] the other of Iroquois, had met a few\r\nyears ago in readiness for battle. The leaders had advanced and were\r\nalready designating the positions for the formation of the lines of\r\nattack, when it is said that one thus addressed the other: \"Let us\r\nspare the blood of our followers; nay, rather let us spare our own.\r\nLet us settle the matter with our bare hands, and he who overcomes the\r\nother shall be the victor.\" The proposition was accepted, and the two\r\njoined battle. The Montagnais, by means of a combination of strategy\r\nand skill with courage, so wearied the Iroquois that he finally hurled\r\nthe latter to the ground, bound him, and triumphantly carried him off\r\nupon his shoulders to his own band. They make their shields of hewn\r\nwood, principally cedar, with slightly-curving edges, light, very long\r\nand very large, so that they cover the entire body. Next, in order\r\nthat they may not be penetrated and split by spears or tomahawks, they\r\noverlace them on the inner side with thongs made from the skins of\r\nanimals, which hold together and connect the whole mass of the shield.\r\nThey do not carry the shield suspended from the arm, but cast by a cord\r\nover the right shoulder, so that it protects the left side of the body;\r\nwhen they have cast their spears or fired their guns they slightly\r\nretire the right side and turn toward the enemy the left side, which is\r\nprotected by the shield.\r\n\r\nIn battle they strive especially to capture their enemies alive.\r\nThose who have been captured and led off to their villages are first\r\nstripped of their clothing; then they savagely tear off their nails\r\none by one with their teeth; then they bind them to stakes and beat\r\nthem as long as they please. Next they release them from their bonds,\r\nand compel them to pass back and forth between a double row of men\r\narmed with thorns, clubs and instruments of iron. Finally, they kindle\r\na fire about them, and roast the miserable creatures with slow heat.\r\nSometimes they pierce the flesh of the muscles with red-hot plates and\r\nwith spits, or cut it off and devour it, half-burned and dripping with\r\ngore and blood. Next, they plant blazing torches all over the body, and\r\nespecially in the gaping wounds; then, after scalping him they scatter\r\nashes and live coals upon his naked head; then they tear the tendons of\r\nthe arms and legs, lacerate them, or, after removing a little of the\r\nskin, leisurely cut them with a knife at the ankle and wrist. Often\r\nthey compel the unhappy prisoner to walk through fire, or to eat, and\r\nthus entomb in a living sepulchre, pieces of his own flesh. Torture of\r\nthis sort has been borne by not a few of the Fathers of the Society.\r\nMoreover, they prolong this torment throughout many days, and, in order\r\nthat the poor victim may undergo fresh trials, intermit it for some\r\ntime, until his vitality is entirely exhausted and he perishes. Then\r\nthey tear the heart from the breast, roast it upon the coals, and, if\r\nthe prisoner has bravely borne the bitterness of the torture, give\r\nit, seasoned with blood, to the boys, to be greedily eaten, in order,\r\nas they say, that the warlike youth may imbibe the heroic strength of\r\nthe valiant man. The prisoner who has beheld and endured stake, knives\r\nand wounds with an unchanging countenance, who has not groaned, who\r\nwith laughter and song has ridiculed his tormentors, is praised; for\r\nthey think that to sing amid so many deaths is great and noble. So\r\nthey themselves compose songs long beforehand, in order that they may\r\nrepeat them if they should by chance be captured. The rest of the crowd\r\nconsume the corpse in a brutal feast. The chief reserves for himself\r\nthe scalp as a sign of victory, a trophy of cruelty.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDOLES ANIMI: CORPORIS CULTUS: CIBI, CONVIVIA; SUPELLEX: RELIGIO, &\r\nSUPERSTITIONES.\r\n\r\nSIC hostes accipiunt: at domi colunt pacem, rixasque diligenter cavent,\r\nnisi quas ebrietatis impotentia excitavit. Fortunati, si nunquam\r\nillis hanc pestem Europa importasset! Irasci ne norunt quidem, ac\r\nvehementer initio mirabantur, cum inveherentur Patres in vitia pro\r\nconcione, eosque furere existimabant, qui pacatos inter auditores, &\r\namicos, tanta contentione se jactarent. Liberalitatis & munificentiæ\r\nfamam aucupantur: sua largiuntur ultro; ablata vix repetunt: nec fures\r\naliter, quam risu & sannis ulciscuntur. Si quem, oborta simultate\r\nnefarie aliquid moliri suspicantur, non minis deterrent hominem, sed\r\ndonis. Ex eodem concordiæ studio fit ut assentiantur ultro, quidquid\r\ndoceas; nihilo tamen secius tenent mordicus insitam opinionem aut\r\nsuperstitionem: eoque difficilius erudiuntur. Quid enim agas cum\r\nannuentibus verbo & concedentibus omnia; re nihil præstantibus?\r\nMiserorum egestatem benignè sublevant; viduarum ac senum sustentant\r\norbitatem, nisi cum senio ætas vieta marcet, vel morbus gravior\r\nincidit: tunc enim abrumpere infelicem vitam satius arbitrantur, quàm\r\nalere ac producere. Quæcumque calamitas ingruat, nunquam se dimoveri de\r\nanimi tranquillitate patiuntur, qua felicitatem potissimum definiunt.\r\nInediam multorum dierum, morbos, & ærumnas lenissime & constantissimè\r\nperferunt. Ipsos partus dolores, licet acerbissimos, ita dissimulant\r\nfeminæ vel superant, ut ne ingemiscant quidem: ac si cui lacryma vel\r\ngemitus excideret, æterna flagraret ignominia, neque virum, à quo\r\nduceretur, præterea inveniret, Nihil unquam amicus cum amico, uxor\r\ncum viro, cum uxore vir, queritur & expostulat. Liberos mira caritate\r\ncomplectuntur: sed modum non tenent; in eos enim neque animadvertunt\r\nipsi, neque ab aliis animadverti sinunt. Hinc petulantia puerorum\r\n& ferocitas, quæ, postquàm se corroboravit ætate, in omne scelus\r\nerumpit. Quam autem erga liberos & familiares comitatem præ se ferunt,\r\neandem cum ceteris civibus suis, ac popularibus, usurpant. Si quis\r\namariore joco quempiam momordit, (nam dicaces vulgo sunt, & in jocos\r\neffusi) belle dissimulant, aut vicem reponunt, & absentes remordent;\r\nnam præsentes cavillari, aut coram dictis incessere, religio est. Non\r\naliud libentiùs convicium regerunt lacessiti, quàm si hominem ingenio\r\ncarere dicant. Scilicet ingenii laudem vindicant sibi; nec temere.\r\nNemo inter illos hebes, ac tardus; quod nativa illorum in deliberando\r\nprudentia, & in dicendo facundia, declarat. Auditi quidem sæpe sunt tam\r\nappositè ad persuadendum perorare, idque ex tempore, ut admirationem\r\nexercitatissimis in dicendi palæstra moverent.\r\n\r\nRespondet ingenio corpus, aptum membris, proceritate formosum, robore\r\nvalidum. Idem, qui Gallis, color; tametsi corrumpunt illum unguine,\r\n& oleo putri, quo se perungunt; necnon pigmentis variis, quibus sibi\r\npulcri, nobis ridiculi, videntur. Alios cernas naso cæruleo, genis\r\nvero & superciliis atratis: alii frontem, nasum, & genas, lineis\r\nversicoloribus discriminant: totidem larvas intueri te putes. Ejusmodi\r\ncoloribus credunt se hostibus esse terribiles; suum pariter in acie\r\nmetum, quasi velo, tegi: demum pellem ipsam corporis indurari, ad\r\nvim hiberni frigoris facilius tolerandam. Præter istos colores\r\ninduci pro cujusque libidine ac deleri solitos, non pauci stabiles\r\nac perpetuas avium aut animalium, putà serpentis, aquilæ, bufonis,\r\nimagines imprimunt cuti, hunc in modum. Subulis, cuspidibus, aut\r\nspinis collum, pectus, genasve ita pungunt, ut rudia rerum istarum\r\nlineamenta effingant: mox in punctam & cruentam cutem immittunt atrum\r\nè carbone comminuto pulverem, qui cum sanguine concretus impressas\r\neffigies ita inurit vivæ carni, ut eas nulla temporis diuturnitas\r\nexpungat. Totæ quædam nationes, ea præsertim quæ a Tabaco nomen habet,\r\nitemque alia quæ Neutra dicitur, id constanti more ac lege usurpat,\r\nnec sine periculo interdum; maxime si est tempestas frigidior, aut\r\ndebilior [347] corporis constitutio. Tunc enim dolore victi, licet eum\r\nne gemitu quidem significent, linquuntur animo, & exanimes aliquando\r\nconcidunt. Laudant oculos exiles, labra repanda & prominentia: pars\r\nradunt comam, pars alunt: his nudum sinciput, illis occiput: aliis coma\r\ntota surrigitur in vertice, aliis parcè ad tempora utrimque propendet.\r\nBarbam, instar monstri, execrantur; ac si quis in mento succrescat\r\npilus, statim vellunt. Viri æque ac feminæ imas auriculas pertundunt:\r\n& iis inaures è vitro, testisve piscium, inferunt. Quo foramen amplius\r\nest, eo censent formosius. Nunquam ungues resecant. Europæos rident,\r\nqui defluentem è naribus humorem candidis sudariis excipiant, &, Quo,\r\ninquiunt, rem adeo sordidam reservant isti? Saltantes curvant arcuatim\r\ncorpus prono capite, & brachia sic agitant, ut qui farinam manibus\r\nsubigunt, raucùm identidem grunnientes. Alvum infimam succingunt lato\r\ncortice, vel animantis pelle, aut versicolore panno, cetera nudi.\r\nFeminæ pelles ex humeris & collo promittunt ad genua. Zonas atque\r\narmillas, è concha veneria, quam vulgo porcellanam appellamus, aut\r\nseta hystricis non inscite contextas, gestant: torques hunc in modum\r\nconfectos magno habent in pretio. Storeas è marisco (junci marini\r\ngenus est) satis eleganter elaborant: iis pavimentum sternunt, in\r\niisdem carpunt somnos, aut in vitulorom marinorum, fibrorumve mollibus\r\nexuviis. Dormiunt circa focum in mapali medio semper ardentem, si\r\nfrigus est: sub dio, si æstas.\r\n\r\nMensam, aut cathedram, in casa tota videas nullam; in clunes subsidunt,\r\nsimiarum instar: is vescentium, is deliberantium, & confabulantium\r\nhabitus est. Adeuntes amicos salutant inepto risu; sæpius ho, hho,\r\nhhho, conclamantes. Cum vescuntur, potum dapibus non intermiscent,\r\nneque identidem bibunt; sed semel tantùm, sumpto cibo. Qui amicos\r\nconvivio accipit, cum iis neque accumbit, nec ciborum partem ullam\r\nattingit, sed epulantibus dividit: aut, si quem adhibet structorem,\r\nsedet seorsum jejunus, & spectat. Inter edendum silent: salem\r\naversantur, & condimenta: ossa canibus projicere piaculum arbitrantur:\r\nigni cremant, vel terræ infodiunt. Si enim, inquiunt, ursi, fibri,\r\n& aliæ, quas venando captamus, feræ, ossa sua permitti canibus, &\r\ncomminui, rescirent; non tam facile capi se paterentur. Adipem è\r\npinguibus collectum cibis, abstergunt coma; genis interdum brachiisve\r\nallinunt, elegantiæ, ut aiunt, causa, & valetudinis: nam adipe non\r\nsolum nitere cutem, sed corroborari membra existimant. Non alio cibo\r\nvescuntur libentius quàm Sagamita. Pulmentum est è farina, præsertim\r\nIndici tritici, confectum: admisto, quod illis condimentum præcipuè\r\nsapit, oleo. Itaque in conviviis pars dapum prima oleum, aut adeps,\r\nin quem concretum & spissum ita dentes infigunt, ut nos in panem aut\r\npomum. Antequam illis lebetes, cortinæ, aliaque id genus vasa ærea\r\ndeferrentur è Gallia, utebantur cacabis è cortice compactis; verùm quia\r\nimponi flammis non poterant impunè, hanc ad coquendas carnes artem\r\nexcogitaverant. Silices plurimos conjiciebant in focum, donec penitus\r\nignem combibissent. Candentes in ollam frigida plenam & carnibus alios\r\natque alios subinde immittebant. Ad hunc modum aqua calefacta carnes\r\ncitius opinione faciliusque percoquit. Ad tergendas manus utuntur\r\npiloso canum tergo, cui illas affricant; item scobe ligni putris. Hæc\r\nmatribus vice panniculorum est, ad purgandas infantium sordes; hæc\r\ninstar culcitæ languidis corporibus substernitur. Vasa coquinaria, non\r\nextergunt. Quo sunt crasso pingui magis oblita, eo melius, illorum\r\njudicio, nitent. Turpe ducunt & superbum inambulare inter colloquendum.\r\nOdorem mosci graviter ferunt, & meram esse mephitim putant, præ carnis\r\nrancidæ, aut adipis mucidi frusto.\r\n\r\nSexcenta sunt ejus generis, in quibus longissimè recedunt ab Europæorum\r\ninstitutis: sed ab illorum vitiis propius absunt, eaque vel æquant, vel\r\nsuperant. Gulæ irritamenta, & inimicas bonæ ac sanæ menti potiones, ab\r\nEuropæis mercatoribus acceperunt, quibus lucri bonus est odor, etiam\r\nex flagitio, & scelerata nundinatione. Tandiu esse pergunt, dum adest\r\nquod edant: nihil in crastinum, aut hyemem, reponunt: nec famem valde\r\nreformidant, quia se ferre diuturnam posse confidunt. Conviviis ea lex\r\nposita consensu moribusque gentis est, ut omnia fercula consumantur.\r\nSi quis edit parciùs, & excusat valetudinem, plectitur, aut ejicitur,\r\nut insulsus, quasi qui vivendi artem nesciat. Primaria supellectilis\r\ndomesticæ pars, olla est, sive ahenum, in quo carnes coquuntur. Opes\r\nlebetum numero metiuntur: nec regem Galliæ aliam ob causam initio magni\r\næstimabant; quàm quòd plures habere ollas dicebatur. Quanta sit apud\r\nexleges, & omni freno solutos, intemperantiæ impunitas & licentia,\r\npræsertim in adolescentibus, promptum est intelligere: nam grandiores\r\nnatu libidinem certis finibus circumscribunt, cùm æstus cupiditatum\r\ndeferbuit: nec impune est peccanti feminæ.\r\n\r\nReligionis apud illos neque lex ulla, neque cura. Nullo stato & certo\r\ncultu Numen prosequuntur. Esse tamen aliquod, velut in sublustri\r\nnocte, vident. Quod quisque puer aspicit in somnis, cum lucescere\r\nratio incipit, hoc illi deinceps numen est, canis, ursus, avis.\r\nVivendi normam & agendi plerumque ducunt è somniis; ut si quem\r\ninterficiendum, exempli causa, somniaverint, non conquiescant donec\r\nhominem insidiis exceptum necaverint. Piget fabulas referre, quas de\r\nmundi opificio comminiscuntur. His implent otiosas & avidas plebis\r\naures harioli, & circulatores nequissimi, impietate quæstuosa.\r\nMalorum auctorem genium nescio quem vocant Manitoù, ac vehementissime\r\nperhorrescunt. Hostem procul dubio generis humani, qui à nonnullis\r\ndivinos honores & sacrificia quædam extorquet. Circa naturam animarum\r\nnon levius delirant. Simulacra fingunt corporea, cibi & potionis\r\negentia. Destinatum animabus versus occidentem solem, pagum credunt,\r\nin quem obita morte se recipiant: & ubi epulis, venationi, & choreis\r\nindulgeant. Hæc enim apud illos summa.\r\n\r\nCum primum de sempiternis ignibus, & incendiis sceleri destinatis\r\naudierunt, immane quantum obstupuere: fidem tamen pertinaciter\r\nabrogabant, quòd dicerent ibi esse ignem non posse, ubi nihil ligni\r\nsit: tum, quænam silvæ alere tot ignes, tam diuturnos, possent? Hæc\r\nratio ineptissima tantam vim apud barbaras mentes habebat, ut iis\r\npersuaderi veritas evangelica non posset. Quippe in homine carnali, ut\r\nait è SS. PP. nonnemo, tota ratio intelligendi est consuetudo cernendi.\r\nExpugnavit nihilominus pertinaciam sacerdos acer & ingeniosus. Fidenter\r\naffirmavit inferorum terram vices obire ligni, & ipsam ardere per sese.\r\nRisu barbaræ multitudinis exceptus est. Imo, inquit, hujus Avernalis\r\nterræ frustum proferam vobis, ut, quoniam verbis divinis non creditis,\r\nvestris ipsi oculis credatis. Accendit curiositatem promissi novitas &\r\nfiducia. Convenerunt è tota regione ad diem constitutum, & in ingenti\r\nplanitie, collibus instar amphitheatri cincta, consederunt. Primores\r\ngentis duodecim lecti fuere, viri graves & cordati, qui sacerdotem\r\nobservarent, numquid fraudis ac præstigiarum lateret. Ille sulphuris\r\nglebam depromit, dat istis arbitris & cognitoribus tractandam: hanc\r\noculis, naso, manu scrutati, haud dubie terram esse confessi sunt.\r\nAderat olla cum prunis candentibus. Tunc sacerdos populo procul\r\nspectante; inhiantibus, demisso in prunas naso, judicibus, excussit in\r\ncarbones è sulphurea gleba particulas aliquot, quæ subito conceperunt\r\nignem & odore fetido nares curiosas impleverunt. Hoc iterum, ac tertiò\r\ncum esset factum, assurrexit multitudo attonita, manum planam imponens\r\nori, quo gestu summam admirationem testantur; & inferos esse dicenti\r\nDeo credidit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS; CARE OF THE BODY; FOOD; FEASTS; HOUSEHOLD\r\nUTENSILS; RELIGION AND SUPERSTITIONS.\r\n\r\nTHUS they treat their enemies; but at home they cultivate peace and\r\ncarefully avoid quarrels, except those which the fury of drunkenness\r\nhas aroused. Fortunate would they be if Europe had never introduced\r\nthis scourge among them! They know nothing of anger, and at first\r\nwere greatly surprised when the Fathers censured their faults before\r\nthe assembly; they thought that the Fathers were madmen, because\r\namong peaceful hearers and friends they displayed such vehemence.\r\nThese people seek a reputation for liberality and generosity; they\r\ngive away their property freely and very seldom ask any return; nor\r\ndo they punish thieves otherwise than with ridicule and derision. If\r\nthey suspect that any one seeks to accomplish an evil deed by means of\r\nfalse pretences, they do not restrain him with threats, but with gifts.\r\nFrom the same desire for harmony comes their ready assent to whatever\r\none teaches them; nevertheless they hold tenaciously to their native\r\nbelief or superstition, and on that account are the more difficult to\r\ninstruct. For what can one do with those who in word give agreement and\r\nassent to everything, but in reality give none? They kindly relieve\r\nthe poverty of the unfortunate; they provide sustenance for widows\r\nand old men in their bereavement, except when, with old age, vitality\r\nis withering away, or some grievous disease arises; for then they\r\nthink it better to cut short an unhappy existence than to support and\r\nprolong it. Whatever misfortune may befall them, they never allow\r\nthemselves to lose their calm composure of mind, in which they think\r\nthat happiness especially consists. They endure many days' fasting,\r\nalso diseases and trials, with the greatest cheerfulness and patience.\r\nEven the pangs of childbirth, although most bitter, are so concealed\r\nor conquered by the women that they do not even groan; and if a tear\r\nor a groan should escape any one of them, she would be stigmatized by\r\neverlasting disgrace, nor could she find a man thereafter who would\r\nmarry her. Friends never indulge in complaint or expostulation to\r\nfriends, wives to their husbands, or husbands to their wives. They\r\ntreat their children with wonderful affection, but they preserve no\r\ndiscipline, for they neither themselves correct them nor allow others\r\nto do so. Hence the impudence and savageness of the boys, which,\r\nafter they have reached a vigorous age, breaks forth in all sorts\r\nof wickedness. Moreover, they exercise the same mildness which they\r\nexhibit toward their children and relatives, toward the remainder of\r\ntheir tribe and their countrymen. If any person has injured another by\r\nmeans of a rude jest (for they are commonly very talkative, and are\r\nready jesters), the latter carefully conceals it, or lays it up, and\r\nin retaliation injures his detractor behind his back; for to jest in\r\nthe victim's presence, or to make a verbal attack, face to face, is\r\ncharacteristic of religion. There is nothing which they are more prone\r\nto use as a counter-allegation, when provoked, than to charge a man\r\nwith a lack of intelligence. For they claim praise because of their\r\nintelligence, and not without good reason. No one among them is stupid\r\nor sluggish, a fact which is evident in their inborn foresight in\r\ndeliberation and their fluency in speaking. Indeed, they have often\r\nbeen heard to make a peroration so well calculated for persuasion,\r\nand that off-hand, that they would excite the admiration of the most\r\nexperienced in the arena of eloquence.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies, well proportioned, handsome because of their height,\r\nvigorous in strength, correspond to their minds. They have the same\r\ncomplexion as the French, although they disfigure it with fat and\r\nrancid oil, with which they grease themselves; nor do they neglect\r\npaints of various colors, by means of which they appear beautiful to\r\nthemselves, but to us ridiculous. Some may be seen with blue noses,\r\nbut with cheeks and eyebrows black; others mark forehead, nose and\r\ncheeks with lines of various colors; one would think he beheld so many\r\nhobgoblins. They believe that in colors of this description they are\r\ndreadful to their enemies, and that likewise their own fear in line of\r\nbattle will be concealed as by a veil; finally, that it hardens the\r\nskin of the body, so that the cold of winter is more easily borne.\r\nBesides these colors, which are usually applied or removed according\r\nto the pleasure of each person, many impress upon the skin fixed and\r\npermanent representations of birds or animals, such as a snake, an\r\neagle, or a toad, in the following manner: With awls, spear-points,\r\nor thorns they so puncture the neck, breast or cheeks as to trace\r\nrude outlines of those objects; next, they insert into the pierced\r\nand bleeding skin a black powder made from pulverized charcoal, which\r\nunites with the blood and so fixes upon the living flesh the pictures\r\nwhich have been drawn that no length of time can efface them. Some\r\nentire tribes--that especially which is called the Tobacco nation,\r\nand also another, which is called the Neutral nation--practice it as\r\na continuous custom and usage; sometimes it is not without danger,\r\nespecially if the season be somewhat cold or the physical constitution\r\nrather weak. [347] For then, overcome by suffering, although they do\r\nnot betray it by even a groan, they swoon away and sometimes drop dead.\r\nThey praise small eyes and turned-up and projecting lips. Some shave\r\ntheir hair, others cultivate it; some have half the head bare, others\r\nthe back of the head; the hair of some is raised upon their heads, that\r\nof others hangs down scantily upon each temple. They detest a beard as\r\na monstrosity, and straightway pull out whatever hair grows upon their\r\nchins. The men as well as the women pierce the lobes of their ears, and\r\nplace in them earrings made of glass or shells. The larger the hole,\r\nthe more beautiful they consider it. They never cut their nails. They\r\nridicule the Europeans, because the latter wipe off the mucus flowing\r\nfrom the nose with white handkerchiefs, and say: \"For what purpose do\r\nthey preserve such a vile thing?\" In dancing, they bend the body, with\r\nthe head lowered, in the form of a bow, and move their arms like those\r\nwho knead dough, at the same time emitting hoarse grunts. They gird\r\nthe lower portion of the belly with a broad piece of bark or hide or a\r\nparti-colored cloth, and leave the rest of the body naked. The women\r\nwear skins hanging from the shoulders and neck to the knees. They wear\r\nbelts and bracelets ingeniously manufactured from Venus shells,[71]\r\nwhich we commonly call porcelain, or from porcupine quills; and\r\nnecklaces made in this fashion they value highly. They make very neat\r\nmats from marisco (a variety of marine rush); with these they cover\r\ntheir floors, and also take their rest upon them, or upon the soft\r\nfurs of the seal or the beaver. In winter they sleep about a fire\r\nconstantly burning in the middle of the lodge, in summer under the open\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nNeither table nor chair can be seen in the hut. They squat upon their\r\nhaunches like monkeys; this is their custom while eating, deliberating\r\nor conversing. They greet approaching friends with silly laughter,\r\nmore often exclaiming, ho, hho, hhho. When they eat they do not take\r\nbeverages with their food, nor do they drink often, but only once\r\nafter eating. Whoever entertains his friends at a feast neither sits\r\nwith them nor touches any part of the food, but divides it among the\r\nfeasters; or, if he has some one act as carver, sits apart fasting\r\nand looks on. While eating they keep silence; they reject salt and\r\ncondiments; they consider it a sin to throw the bones to the dogs; they\r\neither burn them in the fire or bury them in the ground. For, they\r\nsay, if the bears, beaver, and other wild animals which we capture in\r\nhunting should know that their bones were given to dogs and broken to\r\npieces, they would not suffer themselves to be taken so easily. They\r\nwipe off upon their hair the grease which is collected from fatty\r\nfoods; sometimes they smear their cheeks or arms for the sake, as they\r\nsay, of elegance and health; for they think that not only is the skin\r\nmade resplendent with grease, but that the limbs are thus strengthened.\r\nFor no other food do they have such fondness as for Sagamita. It is a\r\nrelish made from flour, especially that of Indian corn, mixed with oil,\r\nwhich as a flavor is held in especial esteem among them. Therefore, in\r\nfeasts the first course consists of oil or fat, in hard and compact\r\nlumps, into which they bite as we do into a piece of bread or an apple.\r\nBefore pots, kettles and other vessels of the sort were brought to\r\nthem from France, they used receptacles of closely joined bark; but,\r\nbecause they could not place them with safety over the flames, they\r\ndevised the following way of cooking meat: They cast a large number of\r\nflint stones into the fire until they had become red-hot. Then they\r\nwould drop these hot stones one after another into a vessel full of\r\ncold water and meat. In this manner the water was heated and the meat\r\ncooked more quickly and more easily than one would suppose. For wiping\r\ntheir hands they use the shaggy back of a dog, also powder of rotten\r\nwood. The last-named is used by mothers, in the place of wash-cloths,\r\nto clean the dirt from their infants; it is also used as a mattress to\r\nsupport the weary body. They do not cleanse their cooking utensils.\r\nThe more they are covered with thick grease, so much the better are\r\nthey, in their judgment. They consider it disgraceful and arrogant to\r\nwalk while conversing. They dislike the odor of musk, and consider it a\r\ndownright pest in comparison with a piece of rancid meat or moldy fat.\r\n\r\nThere, are six hundred matters of this sort in which their customs\r\ndiffer very widely from those of Europeans; but they are less removed\r\nfrom the faults of the latter, and either equal or excel them. They\r\nhave received stimulants of the appetite, and drinks hostile to a good\r\nand sound mind, from European traders, who think much of profit, even\r\nwhen tainted with the disgrace of a wicked traffic. They continue to\r\nexist so long as they have anything to eat; they store up nothing for\r\nto-morrow, or for the winter; nor do they greatly dread famine, because\r\nthey are confident of their ability to bear it for a long time. In\r\nfeasts it is the rule, by general consent and custom of the race, that\r\nall the food shall be consumed. If any one eats sparingly and urges\r\nhis poor health as an excuse, he is beaten or ejected as ill-bred, just\r\nas if he were ignorant of the art of living. The principal article\r\nof their household utensils is the pot or kettle in which the meat\r\nis cooked. They measure property by the number of kettles, and in\r\nthe beginning conceived a high opinion of the king of France, for no\r\nother reason than because he was said to possess a good many kettles.\r\nHow great is the impunity and wantonness of licentiousness among men\r\nuncivilized and free from all restraint, especially among the youth,\r\nmaybe readily observed; for the elder men confine their lust within\r\nfixed limits, after the violence of their passions has subsided, and an\r\nerring woman does not go unpunished.\r\n\r\nThere is among them no system of religion, or care for it. They honor\r\na Deity who has no definite character or regular code of worship. They\r\nperceive, however, through the twilight, as it were, that some deity\r\ndoes exist. What each boy sees in his dreams, when his reason begins\r\nto develop, is to him thereafter a deity, whether it be a dog, a bear,\r\nor a bird. They often derive their principles of life and action from\r\ndreams; as, for example, if they dream that any person ought to be\r\nkilled, they do not rest until they have caught the man by stealth\r\nand slain him. It is wearisome to recount the tales which they invent\r\nconcerning the creation of the world. Soothsayers and worthless quacks\r\nfill with these the idle and greedy ears of the people in order that\r\nthey may acquire an impious gain. They call some divinity, who is the\r\nauthor of evil, \"Manitou,\" and fear him exceedingly. Beyond doubt it\r\nis the enemy of the human race, who extorts from some people divine\r\nhonors and sacrifices. Concerning the nature of spirits, they go none\r\nthe less astray. They make them corporeal images which require food\r\nand drink. They believe that the appointed place, for souls, to which\r\nafter death they are to retire, is in the direction of the setting sun,\r\nand there they are to enjoy feasting, hunting, and dancing; for these\r\npleasures are held in the highest repute among them.\r\n\r\nWhen they first heard of the eternal fire and the burning decreed as\r\na punishment for sin, they were marvelously impressed; still, they\r\nobstinately withheld their belief because, as they said, there could\r\nbe no fire where there was no wood; then, what forests could sustain\r\nso many fires through such a long space of time? This absurd reasoning\r\nhad so much influence over the minds of the savages, that they could\r\nnot be persuaded of the truth of the gospel. For, plainly, in the\r\nphysical man, as some one from Sts. Peter and Paul says, the entire\r\nsystem of knowledge is based on vision. Nevertheless, a clever and\r\ningenious priest overcame their obstinacy. He confidently declared that\r\nthe lower world possessed no wood, and that it burned by itself. He\r\nwas greeted by the laughter of the crowd of savages. \"But,\" said he,\r\n\"I will exhibit to you a piece of this land of Avernus, in order that,\r\nsince you do not believe the words of God, you may trust the evidence\r\nof your own eyes.\" The novelty and boldness of the promise aroused\r\ntheir curiosity. Upon the appointed day they assembled from the whole\r\nneighborhood, and sat down together in an immense plain, surrounded by\r\nhills like an amphitheater. Twelve leading men of the tribe, persons\r\nof dignity and sagacity, were chosen to watch the priest, in order\r\nthat neither fraud nor sorcery might be concealed. He produced a lump\r\nof sulphur and gave it to the judges and inspectors to be handled;\r\nafter examining it with eyes, nose, and hand, they admitted that it\r\nwas certainly earth. There stood near by a kettle containing live\r\ncoals. Then the priest, under the eyes of the people at a distance,\r\nwhile the judges were gaping with their noses thrust down toward the\r\ncoals, shook some grains from the lump of sulphur upon the coals, which\r\nsuddenly took fire and filled the curious noses with a stifling odor.\r\nWhen this had been done a second and a third time, the crowd arose in\r\nastonishment, placing their hands flat over their mouths, by which\r\ngesture they signify great surprise; and believed in the word of God\r\nthat there is a lower world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[51] Rerum Insigniorum Indiculus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _ALCES consideratio_, 7\r\n\r\n  _virtus mira ungulæ ejus_, 8\r\n\r\n  _Angli barbaris gladios et gravidas nitrato\r\n    pulvere fistulas suppeditant_, 27\r\n\r\n  _Animarum de natura delirant Canadenses_, 20, 46\r\n\r\n  _Aves Novæ Franciæ_, 14\r\n\r\n  _Avis prædatrix_, 15\r\n\r\n  _Batavi barbaris arma vendunt_, 27\r\n\r\n  _Canada fluvius_, 5\r\n\r\n  _Canadensium domus_, 16\r\n    _mulierum labores_, 17\r\n    _morbi et ægrorum cura_, 18\r\n    _funera_, 20\r\n    _bella_, 27\r\n    _arma_, 28\r\n    _crudelitas in captivos_, 29\r\n    _indoles_, 33\r\n    _corporis cultus_, 37\r\n    _cibi_, 42\r\n    _convivia_, 44\r\n    [52] _Canadensium supellex_, 44\r\n    _religio et superstitiones_, 45\r\n\r\n  _Captivorum crudelis sors_, 29\r\n\r\n  _Casæ Canadensium_, 16\r\n    _cadavera perjanuam nunquam esseruntur_, 20\r\n\r\n  _Casæ fibrorum_, 10\r\n\r\n  _Causarus seu Piscis armatus_, 12\r\n\r\n  _Clypei barbarorum_, 28\r\n\r\n  _Coquendi ratio in cacabis è cortice confectis_, 42\r\n\r\n  _Ebrietas ab Europæis discitur_, 44\r\n\r\n  _Exequiarum ritus_, 20\r\n\r\n  _Feminis imponitur quidquid laboris est_, 17\r\n\r\n  _Fibri consideratio_, 9\r\n\r\n  _Fluvii quid habent singulare_, 6\r\n\r\n  _Franciæ Novæ descriptio, flumina_, 5\r\n    _coelum_, 6\r\n    _soli natura_, 7\r\n    _feræ_, 7\r\n\r\n  _Galliæ rex cur magni æstimabatur_, 45\r\n\r\n  _Hurones diem Mortuorum celebrant_, 25\r\n\r\n  _Infantium mira mortalitas_, 17\r\n    _cur corpora propter viam sepeliunt_, 21\r\n\r\n  _Infernales ignes esse probat sacerdos_, 48\r\n\r\n  [53] _Iroquæi bellum cum Montanis singulari certamine finiunt_, 28\r\n\r\n  _Iroquæorum lacus_, 12\r\n\r\n  _Kebecum, urbs primaria Novæ Franciæ_, 6\r\n\r\n  _Magna Bellua, quid_, 7\r\n\r\n  _Manitoù, genius malorum_, 46\r\n\r\n  _Missisipus fluvius_, 6\r\n\r\n  _Montani bellum singulari certamine finiunt_, 28\r\n\r\n  _Morborum fontes duo_, 18\r\n\r\n  _Mortuorum festa celebritas apud Hurones_, 25\r\n\r\n  _Mos Canadensis mortuos suscitandi_, 25\r\n\r\n  _Naviculæ barbarorum_, 6\r\n\r\n  _Neutra Natio_, 38\r\n\r\n  _Numen nullo certo cultu prosequuntur_, 44\r\n\r\n  _Palumbes absque numero_, 14\r\n\r\n  _Pisces armatus_, 13\r\n\r\n  _Patres non pauci Societatis Jesu dire torquentur_, 31\r\n\r\n  _Religio Canadensium_, 45\r\n\r\n  _Reticula pedibus substrata ut super nives de ambulent_, 8\r\n\r\n  _S.

I\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOur text of Lescarbot's _La Conversion_ follows, to the close of p.\r\n44 (original pagination), the copy at Lenox Library: pp. 45, 46, the\r\n\"Regitre de Bapteme,\" follow the copy at John Carter Brown Library,\r\nProvidence, R. I., as the Lenox copy does not have these two pages.\r\n\r\nIt is a rare book; the two copies above cited are the only ones known\r\nto us, in America. Leclerc, in _Bibliotheca Americana_ (Paris, 1867),\r\np. 206, says: \"Cette pièce est plus rare que l'Histoire de la Nouvelle\r\nFrance,\" referring to Lescarbot's better-known work. Sabin speaks of it\r\n(vol. x., no. 40167), as \"probably the rarest of Lescarbot's works.\"\r\n\r\nSee further references in the John Carter Brown Catalogue (Bartlett's\r\n_Bibliotheca Americana_, Providence, 1882), vol. ii., no. 99: Graesse's\r\n_Trésor de Livres Rares et Précieux_ (Dresden, 1863), vol. iv., p.\r\n175; Harrisse's _Notes sur la Nouvelle France_ (Paris, 1872), no. 21;\r\nTernaux's _Bibliothèque Américaine_ (Paris, 1837), no. 330; Winsor's\r\n_Narrative and Critical History of America_, vol. iv., p. 299; and\r\nLenox _Catalogue of Jesuit Relations_ (N. Y., 1879), p. 3.[XVII.]\r\n\r\n_Title-page._ This is given in photographic facsimile, in this\r\nreissue. The Lenox and Brown copies are alike, in this. It will be\r\nnoticed that there is no date of publication, this being established\r\nfrom the Privilege.\r\n\r\n_Collation._ Title, 1 p.; blank at back of title, 1 p.; dedication\r\n\"A LA ROYNE,\" 3 pp., signed \"MARC LESCARBOT;\" privilege, 1 p., dated\r\n\"Paris, 9 Sep., 1610,\" and signed \"Brigard;\" text, pp. 7-44. Page 7 is\r\nmisnumbered 1. (The Brown Catalogue says: Page 1 is misnumbered 7.\"\r\nThis is a misprint in the Catalogue.) \"FIN,\" at end of p. 24; then\r\npp. 23 and 24 are reprinted, all except the last sentence on p. 24:\r\n\"Dieu vueille par sa | grace conduire le tout en sorte que la chose |\r\nreüssisse à sa gloire & à l'édification de ce peu-| ple, pour lequel\r\ntous Chrétiens doivent faire | continuelles prieres à sa divine bonté,\r\nà ce qu'il | lui plaise confirmer & avancer l'oeuvre qu'il | lui a pleu\r\nsusciter en ce temps pour l'exaltation | de son nom, & le salut de ses\r\ncreatures. | FIN.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the intention was to have the first leaf (pp. 23,\r\n24) cut out. This duplication of pp. 23, 24 is in both the Brown and\r\nLenox copies.\r\n\r\nThe \"Extrait du Regitre de Bapteme\" in the Brown copy (it is not in the\r\nLenox Copy) forms 2 pages at the end of text. The first page of this\r\n\"Regitre\" is not numbered; the second is numbered \"-4-6\" (intended for\r\n46), and this ends the book. The same \"Regitre\" appears in somewhat\r\ndifferent order in Lescarbot's _Nouvelle France_, (1612 ed.), pp.\r\n638-640, chap. 5, book v.; also, according to Harrisse's _Notes_, in\r\nchap. 3, book v., of the 1611 ed.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn Bertrand's _Lettre Missive_, we follow the original Paris edition,\r\nin Lenox. It is a rare publication, the Lenox copy being apparently\r\nthe only one in the United States; Brown has a manuscript copy, made\r\nfrom that at Lenox. Sabin (vol. x., no. 40682), says: \"It is a piece of\r\nunusual rarity.\" Sabin has a previous reference in vol. ii., no. 5025,\r\nunder caption \"Bertrand,\" wherein a misprint makes him cite the date of\r\nthe letter as \"28 June, 1618\" (eight years later than the actual date);\r\na further misprint causes Sabin to record the pamphlet as having \"48\r\npages or less,\" the actual number being 8. In his _Notes_, Harrisse\r\nomits a line-ending after the second \"nouuelle\" in his description of\r\nthe title-page. See, for further references: Ternaux, no. 329; Winsor,\r\np. 299; Lenox Catalogue, p. 3; Brown Catalogue, vol. ii., no. 103.\r\n\r\n_Title-page._ Given in photographic facsimile, in present volume.\r\n\r\n_Collation._ Title, 1 p.; blank at back of title, 1 p.; text, pp. 3-6;\r\ndated on p. 6, \"Port Royal xxviij.

In the Lenox Catalogue,\r\nit is designated \"O'Callaghan's Reprint, No. 4.\" This numbering of\r\nO'Callaghan's reprints, is merely a device peculiar to the Lenox\r\nCatalogue, for sake of easy reference, and has been followed by Winsor;\r\nthe reprints themselves bear no numbers.\r\n\r\nThe text of this document, however, we have compared with the original\r\nfolio edition of Jouvency's work, in the library of St. Francis Xavier\r\nCollege, New York, and the pagination thereof is indicated instead of\r\nthat of the O'Callaghan Reprint. The list, \"Missiones Societatis Jesu\r\nin America Septentrionali Anno M. DCC.

I\r\n\r\n(_Figures in parentheses, following number of note, refer to pages of\r\nEnglish text._)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. (p. 55)--Marie de Médicis, queen regent, widow of Henry of Navarre;\r\nappointed regent by the king, the day before his assassination, May 14,\r\n1610. She was accused of having been privy to his murder.\r\n\r\n2. (p. 55)--The reports of Champlain, and the maps and charts with\r\nwhich, upon returning from his voyage of 1603, he entertained\r\nHenry IV., so interested the latter that he vowed to encourage the\r\ncolonization of New France. To carry on this work he commissioned,\r\nas his lieutenant-general in Acadia, Pierre du Gua, Sieur de Monts,\r\ngovernor of Pons, a Huguenot resident at court, and, according to\r\nChamplain, \"a gentleman of great respectability, zeal, and honesty.\" De\r\nMonts' commission is given at length in Baird's _Huguenot Emigration\r\nto America_, vol. i., p. 341; his charter of \"La Cadie\" embraced the\r\ncountry between the 40th and 46th degrees of latitude, and he held\r\ntherein a monopoly of the fur trade. J. G. Bourinot, in _Canadian\r\nMonthly_, vol. vii., pp. 291, 292, says the name Acadia (also written\r\nAcadie, and La Cadie) \"comes from àk[^a]de, which is an affix used\r\nby the Souriquois or MIC Macs ... to signify a place where there is\r\nan abundance of some particular thing.\"--See, also, Laverdière's\r\n_Oeuvres de Champlain_ (Quebec, 1870), p. 115. In 1604, De Monts\r\nsailed from France with a colony composed of Catholics and Huguenots,\r\nserved by \"a priest and a minister.\" Champlain and Poutrincourt were\r\nwith the expedition, and Pontgravé commanded one of the two ships.\r\nThe cancelling of his monopoly (1607), deprived De Monts of the means\r\nto carry on his colonization schemes. The title to Port Royal he had\r\nalready ceded to Poutrincourt. The king renewed De Monts' monopoly\r\nfor one year, upon his undertaking to found a colony in the interior.\r\nThereupon De Monts sent Champlain to the St. Lawrence (1608), as\r\nhis lieutenant. Upon the death of Henry IV. (1610), De Monts, now\r\nfinancially ruined, surrendered his commission, selling his proprietary\r\nrights to the Jesuits.\r\n\r\n\"Jean de Biencourt, Baron de Poutrincourt, a gentleman of Picardy,\r\na brave chevalier, had carried arms against Henry IV. in the ranks\r\nof the Catholics, during the wars of the League. Lescarbot tells how\r\n'The king, holding him besieged in his castle of Beaumont, wished\r\nto give him the dukedom of this place in order to attach him to his\r\nservice.' Poutrincourt refused. But, when the king had abjured his\r\nfaith, he served this prince loyally and followed him to battle, where\r\nhe accumulated more honor than fortune. In 1603, he lived in retirement\r\nwith his wife, Jeanne de Salazar, and his children, in his barony of\r\nSaint-Just, in Champagne, struggling painfully against the difficulties\r\nof an embarrassed situation, and striving to improve the tillage and\r\ncrops of his little domain. It was here that De Monts, his former\r\ncompanion in arms, found him. He knew his courage, his intelligence,\r\nand his activity, and did not doubt that a voyage to Canada and an\r\nagricultural colony in these distant lands, so fertile and primeval,\r\nwould appeal to his ardent soul. Poutrincourt, in fact, received with\r\nenthusiasm the plan of his old friend; however, before binding himself\r\ndefinitely, he wished to find out, on his own account, something\r\nabout the state of the country, and for this purpose to make a trial\r\nvoyage.\"--Rochemonteix's _Les Jésuites et la Nouvelle France_ (Paris,\r\n1896), vol. i., p. 11.\r\n\r\nPleased with Annapolis harbor, Poutrincourt decided to settle there\r\nwith his family, and De Monts gave him a grant of the place. In 1606,\r\nPoutrincourt made a second voyage to Port Royal, exploring the coast\r\nwith Champlain and Lescarbot. After the abandonment of the colony\r\n(1607), he went to France, returning to Acadia in 1610, inspired with\r\nzeal to convert the savages, but without the aid of the Jesuits. See\r\nParkman's _Pioneers of France in the New World_ (ed. 1885, which will\r\nhereafter be cited, unless otherwise noted), pp. 244-322; also Shea's\r\ned. of Charlevoix's _History of New France_, vol. i., p. 260. By the\r\ndestruction of Port Royal in 1613, he was the heaviest loser--the\r\ntotal loss to the French, according to Charlevoix, being a hundred\r\nthousand crowns. In 1614, Poutrincourt visited the ruins of Port Royal\r\nfor the last time, thence returning to France to engage in the service\r\nof the king. He was fatally wounded by a treacherous shot after the\r\ntaking of Méry (1615). Baird (_Hug. Emig._, vol. i., p. 94), says:\r\n\"This nobleman, if nominally a Roman Catholic, appears to have been in\r\nfull sympathy with his Huguenot associates, De Monts and Lescarbot.\r\nHis hatred of the Jesuits was undisguised.\" Lescarbot's account of\r\nPoutrincourt's dispute with them differs essentially from that given by\r\nBiard, _post_.\r\n\r\n3. (p. 55)--Marc Lescarbot (or L'Escarbot), parliamentary advocate,\r\nwas born at Vervins, France, between 1570 and 1580. He was more given\r\nto literature than to law, and appears to have been a man of judgment,\r\ntact, and intelligence. He spent the winter of 1606-07 at Port Royal,\r\nwhich Slafter (Prince Soc. ed. of _Voyages of Samuel Champlain_, vol.\r\nii., p. 22, _note_ 56) locates \"on the north side of the bay [Annapolis\r\nBasin] in the present town of Lower Granville; not, as often alleged,\r\nat Annapolis.\" See Bourinot's \"Some Old Forts by the Sea,\" in _Trans.\r\nRoyal Society of Canada_, sec. ii, pp. 72-74, for description of Port\r\nRoyal, which he places on the site of the present Annapolis. In the\r\nspring of 1607, Lescarbot explored the coast between the harbor of St.\r\nJohn, N. B., and the River St. Croix. On the abandonment of De Monts'\r\ncolony, the same year, he returned to France, where he wrote much\r\non Acadia and in praise of Poutrincourt. Larousse gives the date of\r\nhis death as 1630. Parkman's _Pioneers_, pp. 258 _et seq._, gives a\r\nlively account of Lescarbot's winter at the colony. Abbé Faillon, in\r\n_Histoire de la Colonie Française en Canada_ (Montreal, 1865), vol. i,\r\np. 91, says he has given us the best accounts extant (in the present\r\ndocument, his _Histoire de la Nouvelle France_, 1609, and his _Les\r\nMuses de la Nouvelle France_, 1618) of the enterprises of De Monts and\r\nPoutrincourt; and that while a Catholic in name, he was a Huguenot at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n4. (p. 57)--_Clameur de Haro, Chartre Normand_, an expression used in\r\nall the privileges or licenses granted by the king to booksellers.\r\nThe latter phrase refers to a deed containing numerous privileges or\r\nconcessions, accorded to the inhabitants of Normandy by Louis X., Mar.\r\n19, 1313, and repeatedly confirmed afterward. _Haro_ is supposed to be\r\nderived from, _Ha Rou!_ or _Ha Rollo!_ Hence an appeal to Rollo, the\r\nfirst Duke of Normandy.\r\n\r\n5. (p. 59)--The first attempt of the Huguenots to establish a colony in\r\nAmerica was at Rio Janeiro, under Villegagnon (1555). A reinforcement\r\nwas sent thither in 1557, and among its Calvinist preachers was Jean de\r\nLéri, the historian of the disastrous undertaking. See his _Historia\r\nNavigationis in Brasiliam_ (1586), quoted in Parkman's _Pioneers_, p.\r\n28.\r\n\r\n6. (p. 61)--The St. Lawrence; so named by Cartier (1535), but\r\nfrequently called \"The Great River,\" \"The River of the Great Bay,\"\r\netc., by early annalists. In the account of his second voyage, Cartier\r\nstyles it _le grand fleuve de Hochelaga_. See Winsor's _Narrative and\r\nCritical History of America_, vol. iv., p. 163; also his _Cartier to\r\nFrontenac_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n7. (p. 61)--Concerning early European acquaintance with American\r\nIndians:\r\n\r\n\"In the yeere 1153 ... it is written, that there came to Lubec, a\r\ncitie of Germanie, one Canoa with certaine Indians, like vnto a long\r\nbarge: which seemed to haue come from the coast of Baccalaos, which\r\nstandeth in the same latitude that Germanie doth.\" (Antoine Galvano,\r\nin Goldsmid's ed. of _Hakluyt's Voyages_, vol. xvi., p. 293.)\r\n\r\nHarrisse (_Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima_, no. 71) cites the\r\n_Chronicon_ of Eusebius (Paris, 1512) as having, \"under the date 1509,\r\na notice saying that there had been brought to Rouen seven Savages from\r\nNorth America.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Newfoundland, when first discovered by the French,\r\ncalled codfish _bacalos_, which Lescarbot and other early French\r\nwriters say is identical with the Basque word for codfish. Many\r\nevidences led Cartier, upon his first voyage (1534), to believe that\r\nthe natives had had previous intercourse with Europeans.\r\n\r\n8. (p. 61)--Probably André Thevet. A translation of his description of\r\nthe Isles of Demons (now known as Belle Isle and Quirpon), is given\r\nin Parkman's _Pioneers_, p. 191. Thevet's _Cosmographie Universelle_\r\n(Paris, 1558), and _Singularitez de la France antarctique_ (Paris,\r\n1558), must have been familiar to Lescarbot. De Costa gives a\r\ntranslation of so much of the _Cosmographie_ as relates to New England,\r\nin _Magazine of American History_, vol. viii., p. 130: \"The production\r\nof the mendacious monk, André Thevet.\" It seems clear that Thevet never\r\nsaw the American coast, that his imagination amplified the accounts of\r\nnavigators who had visited the region, particularly those of Cartier.\r\nPriceless as are first editions of Thevet, he has a poor reputation for\r\nveracity.\r\n\r\n9. (p. 61)--The Armouchiquois (or Almouchiquois of Champlain)\r\nwere, according to Parkman (_Jesuits of N. America_, p. xxi.), the\r\nAlgonkin tribes of New England,--Mohicans, Pequots, Massachusetts,\r\nNarragansetts, and others,--\"in a chronic state of war with the tribes\r\nof New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\" Williamson, in _History of the\r\nState of Maine_ (Hallowell, 1832, vol. i., p. 477), says they were an\r\nEtchemin tribe, the Marechites of the St. John River; but Champlain,\r\nwho had, like Biard, visited the Armouchiquois country, says that it\r\nlies beyond Choüacoet (Saco), and that the language is different from\r\nthose of the Souriquois and Etchemins. Laverdière affirms that \"the\r\nFrench called Almouchiquois several peoples or tribes that the English\r\nincluded under the term Massachusetts;\" and he conjectures that these\r\ntwo names are etymologically allied.--See his _Champlain_, pp. 200,\r\n205, 206.\r\n\r\n10. (p. 61)--Lescarbot here refers to his _Histoire de la Nouvelle\r\nFrance_. The first edition (Paris, 1609) is a rare prize to\r\ncollectors,--a London catalogue of 1878 pricing it at £45. The edition\r\nof 1612 is followed in the Tross reprint (Paris, 1866); that of 1618\r\ncontains Lescarbot's assault upon the Jesuits. The fourth and sixth\r\nbooks, only, were \"translated out of the French into English\" by P.\r\nErondelle, 1609. A German version of a brief summary of the work\r\nappeared in 1613.\r\n\r\n11. (p. 67)--The term Norembega, variously spelled, was applied\r\nindifferently to the entire range of Acadian and New England coast;\r\nbut apparently the Penobscot is here meant. See Winsor's _N. and C.\r\nHist._, vol. iv., index; _Documentary History of State of Maine_, vol.\r\nii., pp. lii., liii.; Prince Society's ed. of _Champlain_, memoir and\r\nindex. The claim is made for Bangor, Me., that it is on the site of an\r\nancient town called Norumbega. Much information on this point is given\r\nin _Maine Hist. Soc. Colls._, vols. ii., iv., v., vii., viii., and ix.\r\nSewall claims that the true form of Norumbegua is Arâmbec, and that it\r\nwas the name of a city of the savages, situated near the head-waters of\r\nthe Damariscotta, above Pemaquid.--_Ancient Dominions of Maine_, pp.\r\n30-46. Horsford, in _Discovery of the Ancient City of Norembega_ and\r\n_Defences of Norembega_ (Boston, 1890 and 1891), claims, on slender\r\nevidence, that Watertown, Mass., occupies the site of an old town of\r\nthat name founded by Norse vikings in 1000 A. D.\r\n\r\n12. (p. 67)--Bay of Fundy; first shown on map of Diego Homem (1558);\r\nnamed by De Monts Grande Baye Française (shown on Lescarbot's chart of\r\nPort Royal); appears as Argal's Bay, on Alexander's map (1624); Golfo\r\ndi S. Luize, on Dudley's (1647); Fundi Bay, on Moll's (1712); and Bay\r\nof Fundy, or Argal, on that of the English and French Commissioners\r\n(1755). Bourinot (_Canad. Mo._, vol. vii., p. 292) says that Fundy is\r\na corruption of _Fond de la Baie_, as the lower part of the bay was\r\ncalled; he follows here Ferland's suggestion, in _Cours d'Histoire du\r\nCanada_ (Quebec, 1861), vol. i., p. 65.\r\n\r\n13. (p. 67)--The son of Pontgravé, who, according to Parkman\r\n(_Pioneers_, p. 290) had exasperated the Indians by an outrage on one\r\nof their women, and had fled to the woods.\r\n\r\n14. (p. 69)--_Palourdes_ is Breton for a kind of shellfish.\r\n\r\n15. (p. 73)--The Souriquois, or Micmacs, of Nova Scotia. Champlain's\r\nmap of 1632 places them east of Port Royal.\r\n\r\n16. (p. 73)--Raphael Maffei, Maffeus Volaterranus, or Raffaello\r\nVolterrano, savant and historian; born in Volterra 1451, died 1521 or\r\n1522. Harrisse (_Bib. Amer. Vet._, p. 88) gives a catalogue of his\r\nworks, and says, \"The _Commentary_ of Maffei has a peculiar interest\r\nfrom the fact that it preceded the publication of Peter Martyr's\r\n_Decades_\" (1511-46).\r\n\r\nLaverdière (_Champlain_, p. 70, _note_) says that _sagamo_ is a\r\nMontagnais word; and he cites Laflèche as deriving it from _tchi_ and\r\n_okimau_, meaning \"great chief.\"\r\n\r\n17. (p. 73)--Berosus (325-255 B. C., _circa_), a Chaldean priest,\r\nastrologer, and historian. His best known work is the _Babylonica_,\r\na history of Babylonia; its remaining fragments have been reproduced\r\nby several European writers, especially in Richter's _Berosi Chald.\r\nHistoriæ quae supersunt_ (Leipsic, 1825).\r\n\r\n18. (p. 75)--The Tolosains were a tribe of the Volcæ of Gaul. Another\r\ntribe of the Volcæ were the Tectosages--so called from their _sagum_\r\n(frock or cloak).\r\n\r\n19. (p. 75)--Membertou was chief of all the Micmac groups from Gaspé to\r\nCape Sable. Champlain writes, that he was \"a friendly savage, although\r\nhe had the name of being the worst and most traitorous man of his\r\ntribe.\" Lescarbot called him \"the _chef d'oeuvre_ of Christian piety,\"\r\nand Biard had strong faith in him. He claimed to remember the first\r\nvisit of Cartier (1534).\r\n\r\n20. (p. 77)--Biard, six years later, complains bitterly of this\r\noverhaste in baptizing, declaring that these savages, when he went\r\namong them in 1611, did not know the first principles of the Faith, and\r\nhad even forgotten their Christian names.\r\n\r\n21. (p. 81)--In the original edition, pp. 25 and 26, apparently through\r\nan error in make-up, are verbal repetitions of the two preceding pages.\r\nThis duplication has been omitted in the present edition.\r\n\r\n22. (p. 105)--Marked changes occurred in the population of the St.\r\nLawrence valley, between the visits of Cartier (1535) and Champlain\r\n(1603). Morgan, in _League of the Iroquois_ (Rochester, 1851), p. 5,\r\nmaintains the correctness of a tradition that the aborigines whom\r\nCartier found at Hochelaga were Iroquois, and that they then were\r\nsubject to the Algonkins, whom Champlain found in possession of the\r\nvalley. Cf. Parkman's _Pioneers_, p. 208, and Schoolcraft's _Hist.\r\nof Indian Tribes of the U. S._, vol. vi., pp. 33, 188. For further\r\ntreatment of the migrations of the Iroquois, see Introduction to Hale's\r\n_Iroquois Book of Rites_ (Phila., 1883), and Faillon's _Col. Fr._, vol.\r\ni., pp. 524, _et seq._\r\n\r\n23. (p. 107)--_Tabagie._ A feast described fully in one of the later\r\nRelations.\r\n\r\n24. (p. 107)--This easy victory of the French and Algonkins over the\r\nIroquois (July 29, 1609), on the western shores of Lake Champlain, cost\r\nNew France dearly, as it secured for the struggling colony the deadly\r\nenmity of the most warlike savages on the continent, for nearly a\r\ncentury and a half. It was impossible for New France to make permanent\r\nheadway when sapped by such an enemy. Slafter's exhaustive notes to\r\n_Champlain's Voyages_ (Prince Soc.), vol. i., p. 91, and vol. ii.,\r\np. 223, make it clear that the site of this momentous skirmish was\r\nTiconderoga.\r\n\r\n25. (p. 109)--Jessé Fléché, a secular priest from the diocese of\r\nLangres, was invited by Poutrincourt to accompany the first colony to\r\nAcadia. The papal nuncio gave him authority to absolve in all cases,\r\nexcept those reserved to the pope.--Faillon's _Col. Fr._, vol. i., p.\r\n99. Poutrincourt evidently meant to Christianize Acadia without the aid\r\nof the Jesuits. The wholesale baptism of savages by Fléché, before the\r\narrival of Biard and Massé, was, according to Faillon (_Ibid._, vol.\r\ni., p. 100), condemned as a profanation by good Catholics, \"tous les\r\nthéologiens, and notamment la Sorbonne.\"--Cf. also note 19, _ante_,\r\nand Sagard's _Histoire du Canada_, p. 97. He had been at Port Royal\r\nnearly a year before the arrival of the Jesuits. The name is variously\r\nspelled: Fleche, Fléche, Flèche, Fléché, Flesche, Fleuchy, and Fleuche;\r\nsee Sulte's _Poutrincourt en Acadie_, p. 38. See Bourinot's picturesque\r\ndescription of the baptismal scene, in _Can. Royal Soc. Trans._, sec.\r\nii, p. 73. Fléché was much esteemed by the Micmacs; his nickname, \"Le\r\nPatriarch,\" is still current among them corrupted into \"Patliasse,\"\r\nas the name for a priest.--See Ferland's _Cours d'Histoire_ (Quebec,\r\n1861), vol. i, p. 80.\r\n\r\n26. (p. 127)--The four letters here given (Biard, Jan. 21, June 10, and\r\nJune 11, 1611; and Massé, June 11, 1611) are from Carayon's _Première\r\nMission des Jésuites au Canada: Lettres et Documents Inédits_ (Paris,\r\n1864). All of the documents in Carayon's collection will be published\r\nin this series, in chronological order, with that Editor's valuable\r\nfootnotes.\r\n\r\nAuguste Carayon, S. J., a leading authority upon the history of his\r\norder in New France, was born in Saumur, France, 1813, and died in\r\nPoitiers, 1874. His principal works were: _Bibliographie historique de\r\nla Compagnie de Jésus; Catalogue des ouvrages relatifs à l'histoire\r\ndes Jésuites depuis leur origine jusqu'à nos jours_ (Paris, 1864);\r\n_Documents inédits concernant la Compagnie de Jésus_ (Poitiers,\r\n1863-1875, 18 vols.); _Première Mission des Jésuites au Canada_ (Paris,\r\n1864); _Bannissement des Jésuites de la Louisiane_ (Paris, 1865);\r\n_Établissement de la Compagnie de Jésus à Brest, par Louis XIV._\r\n(1865); _Prisons du Marquis de Pombal, ministre du Portugal, journal\r\nde 1759 à 1777_ (1865); _Notes historiques sur les parlements et les\r\nJésuites au dix-huitième siécle_ (1867). Carayon also edited numerous\r\nimportant historical works, between 1864 and 1871.\r\n\r\n27. (p. 127)--Pierre Biard, S. J., writer of several of the early\r\nAcadian _Relations_, was born at Grenoble, France, 1567, and died at\r\nAvignon, November 17, 1622. In 1608, he was called from a chair of\r\nscholastic theology and Hebrew, in Lyons, by Father Coton, the King's\r\nconfessor and preacher, to take charge of the Jesuit mission in Acadia.\r\nHis several accounts of the colony, with the part taken by himself in\r\nnotable episodes, do not always agree with the version of Lescarbot.\r\nSee Parkman's _Pioneers_, part ii., chaps, v.-viii.; also, R. P. Felix\r\nMartin's _Life of R. P. Pierre Biard,_ S. J. (Montreal, 1890).\r\n\r\n28. (p. 127)--Claude Aquaviva, S. J., born 1544; elected general of the\r\nSociety of Jesus, 1581; died, 1615; a Neapolitan nobleman; chamberlain\r\nof the Court of Rome; fifth general of the order, and ranked by some\r\nhistorians as its ablest legislator and second founder. See Nicolini's\r\n_History of the Jesuits_, pp. 210, 257.\r\n\r\n29. (p. 127)--Fathers Biard and Massé sailed January 26.\r\n\r\n30. (p. 129)--_Brother-coadjutor._ The six classes of the order\r\nof Jesuits were: (1) novices, (2) lay-brothers, (3) scholars, (4)\r\ncoadjutors, (5) Jesuits of the Third Order, and (6) Jesuits of the\r\nFourth Order. See Thomas D'Arcy McGee's _Lecture on the Jesuits_.\r\n\r\n31. (p. 133)--Biencourt and Robin de Coulogne, not having means to\r\nequip and provision the vessel which was to convey Biard and Massé\r\nto Port Royal, made an arrangement with Dujardin and Duquesne, two\r\nmerchants of Dieppe, by which the latter undertook to furnish the\r\nequipment and supplies in consideration of being admitted as partners\r\nin Poutrincourt's fur-trading and cod-fishing enterprise. Concerning\r\nthis _Contract d'Association des Jésuites au Trafique du Canada_,\r\nmade January 20, 1611, see Parkman's _Pioneers_, p. 288, _note_. Cf.\r\nalso, Rochemonteix's _Jésuites_, vol. i., p. 32. These partners, being\r\nHuguenots, objected to the shipment of the Jesuits, but finally sold\r\ntheir interests for 2,800 livres to Madame de Guercheville, whose\r\npart in this expedition is related in note 33, _post_. See Biard's\r\nsucceeding letter, for fuller details of this adventure.\r\n\r\n32. (p. 133)--_Formal order of the Queen._ October 7, 1610, the young\r\nKing, Louis XIII., wrote from Monceaux to Baron de Poutrincourt:\r\n\"Monsieur de Poutrincourt, as Father Pierre Biard and Father Ennemond\r\nMassé, religious of the Society of Jesus, are being sent over to New\r\nFrance to celebrate the divine services of the church and to preach the\r\nGospel to the people of that country, I wish to hereby recommend them\r\nto you, that you may, upon all occasions, assist and protect them in\r\nthe exercise of their noble and holy calling, assuring you that I shall\r\nconsider it a great service.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen Mother also wrote: \"Monsieur de Poutrincourt, now that the\r\ngood Jesuit Fathers are about to try, under the authority of the King,\r\nmy son, to establish our faith over there, I hereby request you to\r\ngive them, for the success of this good work, all the courtesy and\r\nassistance in your power, as a service very near our heart, and very\r\nacceptable to us, praying God, Monsieur de Poutrincourt, to keep you\r\nunder his holy and watchful care.\"--David Asseline's _Antiquities and\r\nChronicles of the City of Dieppe_ (Dieppe, 1874; 2 vols.) The letters\r\nare reproduced in Faillon's _Col. Fr._, vol. i., p. 102.\r\n\r\n33. (p. 135)--Antoinette de Pons, Marquise de Guercheville, patroness\r\nof Jesuit missions in New France, was lady of honor to Marie de\r\nMédicis, and accounted one of the most beautiful and zealously\r\nreligions women of her time. Taking up the defence of the Jesuits\r\nagainst Poutrincourt, she not only bought the ship in which to\r\ntransport them to America, but the cargo and the royal patent of\r\nDe Monts, thus succeeding the latter as proprietor of all Acadia,\r\nexcepting Port Royal, which still remained in Poutrincourt's\r\npossession. Concerning her rupture with De Monts, see Shea's\r\n_Charlevoix_, vol. i., p. 274. She resolved to plant a strictly\r\nCatholic colony at Pentagoet (site of Bangor, Me.), and sent out,\r\nunder La Saussaye, some fifty settlers and three Jesuit missionaries\r\n(1613). Upon reaching Port Royal, they were joined by Biard and Massé,\r\nand thence proceeded to the eastern side of Mount Desert Island. For\r\nthe location of their mission, St. Sauveur, see Parkman's _Pioneers_,\r\np. 304, _note_. The descent of the English under Argall (1613), was\r\nthe end of Madame de Guercheville's mission. See _N. Y. Colonial\r\nDocuments_, vol. iii., pp. 1, 2, concerning reparation allowed her\r\nby the government of Great Britain for the loss of her vessel. Cf.\r\nFaillon's _Col. Fr._, vol. i., pp. 110-117; and Baird's _Hug. Emig._,\r\nvol. i., p. 103. Upon the queen regent's high regard for the Jesuits,\r\nsee _Col. Fr._, vol. i., pp. 101, 102.\r\n\r\n34. (p. 141)--Several of the old French coins were called écus. They\r\ndate from the period of Charles VII.,--_écus à la couronne_, or crowns\r\nof gold, from the crown which formed the type of the reverse.--Prime's\r\n_Coins, Medals, and Seals_, p. 150. The écu of Louis XIV. is first\r\ngiven in Dye's _Coin Encyclopedia_, p. 621; value in United States\r\ncurrency, $1.10S. The early écu was equal to three francs; later, to\r\nabout five.\r\n\r\n35. (p. 141)--_Viaticum._ In Père de Ravignan's _On the Existence and\r\nInstitutions of the Jesuits_ (Paris, 1862), p. 190, _note_ ii., mention\r\nis made of a custom in connection with the viaticum of missionaries,\r\nwhich was frequently observed at this time. The founders or benefactors\r\nof missions, in order to obtain with greater certainty and abundance\r\nthe money which they intended for missionary work in distant lands,\r\ncharged the merchants, who acted as agents, to sell the merchandise\r\nwhich they consigned to them, and to remit the price of it to the\r\nmissionaries for their support. Thus Madame de Guercheville furnished\r\nconsiderable money to Biencourt to invest in the fish and fur trade,\r\nwhich he was about to undertake, with the sole condition that, for\r\nher share, he should support the missionaries. See Rochemonteix's\r\n_Jésuites_, vol. i., pp. 35-36, _note_.\r\n\r\n36. (p. 141)--The Marchioness de Verneuil furnished their chapel,\r\nMadame de Sourdis their vestments and linen, and Madame de Guercheville\r\nprovided other necessaries.--_Annuæ Litteræ S. J._, an. 1612, p. 570.\r\n\r\nMadame de Verneuil founded a convent of Annunciades, and gave her\r\ndeclining years to religion. She died at Paris, 1633, aged 54.\r\n\r\n37. (p. 143)--In his _Relation_ of 1616, chap, xi., Biard says: \"Thomas\r\nRobin de Coulogne enjoyed a modest fortune; he had often heard about\r\nNew France from the Dieppe merchants, and had wished to mingle in this\r\ncolonization movement. What Baron de Poutrincourt told him about the\r\nattempts made at Port Royal pleased him greatly, and he promised to\r\nassist him.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of Monsieur de Coullogne (Coulogne) and of Madame de\r\nSigogne (Sicoine) appear in Fléché's list of baptisms, _ante_. Other\r\ncontemporary spellings of Coulogne are: Cologne, Coloigne, and Coloine.\r\n\r\n38. (p. 147)--This is an interesting, and we believe a unique\r\nstatement of Biard, that the islands off the Gulf of St. Lawrence were\r\nonce called the \"Azores of the Great Bank.\" The maps of many early\r\ncartographers and navigators represent Newfoundland as a group of\r\nislands, or a large island with a circlet of smaller ones, or \"almost a\r\nsingle island.\"--See Winsor's _N. and C. Hist._, vol. i., pp. 74, 77,\r\n79, 93, 379. As Newfoundland was the first land sighted by voyagers in\r\nNew France, and as their last sight of land had been the Azores, the\r\nnaming of the islands on the Great Bank the Azores is in keeping with\r\ntheir custom in this regard.\r\n\r\n39. (p. 149)--Ennemond Massé, S. J., born at Lyons, 1574; died at\r\nSillery, Canada, 1646; admitted to the Society of Jesus at the age of\r\ntwenty, and assigned to a chair of theology in Lyons; in 1608, chosen\r\nby Father Coton to accompany Biard to Acadia. He was again sent to\r\nCanada in 1625, with Charles Lalemant, Jean de Brébeuf, and two lay\r\nbrothers. During the English occupation of Canada (1629-32), he was in\r\nFrance, but returned with Brébeuf in 1633. Rochemonteix (_Jésuites_,\r\nvol. i., p. 24). says of him: \"Of an impetuous and violent nature, he\r\nhad all he could do to restrain it. But, by vigilance and perseverance,\r\nhe conquered it so well that he no longer seemed to have any strong\r\nimpulses or passions. Industrious, unwearying, of robust health, he\r\nwas prepared for the hardships of a distant mission by a life of\r\npenitence and denial, frequently fasting, sleeping upon hard boards,\r\naccustoming his taste to everything, and his body to extreme cold and\r\nheat. Although innocent as a child, he led the life of a penitential\r\nanchorite; in 1608, they made him an Associate to Father Coton, then\r\nconfessor and preacher to the king. But this austere apostle preferred\r\na life of privation and sacrifice to that of the court. He chose\r\nCanada.\" Bressani's _Relatione_, to be given _post_, describes the\r\ndeath of Massé, who was one of the most notable of the missionaries\r\nof New France. A monument to his memory has been erected at Sillery.\r\nThere is a difference of usage in the matter of accenting his name:\r\nCharlevoix, Winsor, and Parkman do not use the accent; but Champlain,\r\nBiard, and Cretineau-Joly do, and Faillon (_Col. Fr._, vol. i., p. 101)\r\ngives authorities for this usage, which we have preferred to adopt.\r\n\r\n40. (p. 151)--Bourinot (_Canad. Mo._, vol. vii., p. 292) says _Canso_\r\nis a Souriquois word meaning \"facing the frowning cliff;\" also, that\r\n\"the strait was long called after the Sieur de Fronsac, one of the\r\nearly gentlemen adventurers who held large estates in Acadia.\" It is\r\nshown as _detroit de Fronsac_ on Chabert's map (1750); it is Camceau on\r\nChamplain's map of 1632; it sometimes appears as Campceau on old French\r\ndocuments; and is spelled both Canceaux and Canso in the official\r\ncorrespondence between France and England in the eighteenth century. In\r\n1779, the fisheries of Canso were worth £50,000 a year to England. See\r\nMurdoch's _History of Nova Scotia_ (Halifax, 1865-67), vol. ii, p. 597.\r\n\r\n41. (p. 151)--Lescarbot states that they arrived at night, three hours\r\nafter sunset.--_Relation dernière_ (Bans, 1612), to be given _post_.\r\n\r\n42. (p. 153)--Cap de la Hève, now known as Cape La Have, is the\r\nsouthern point of La Have Island, off New Dublin Bay, one of many\r\nindentations of the coast of the township of New Dublin, Lunenburg\r\nCounty, Nova Scotia. The cape is a picturesque cliff or bluff rising\r\n107 feet above tide level, and visible a long distance out to sea.\r\nWhen De Monts and Champlain left Havre de Grâce, France, in March,\r\n1604, Cap de la Hève, in the suburb of St. Adresse, must have been the\r\nlast land seen by them; as this cliff off New Dublin was probably the\r\nfirst sighted by them in La Cadie, it was natural that they should\r\nname it after the famous French landmark. There are evidences on La\r\nHave Island of an early French settlement, of which there appear to be\r\nno records; although it is known that Saussaye planted a cross there,\r\nMay 16, 1613. De Laet, in describing Cadie (1633) says: \"Near Cap de\r\nla Hève lies a port of the same name, 44° 5' north latitude, with safe\r\nanchorage.\"--See Des Brisay's _Hist. of Co. of Lunenburg, N. S._ (2d\r\ned., Toronto, 1895), pp. 166 _et seq._ The Editor is also indebted to\r\nF. Blake Crofton, secretary of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, for\r\ninformation under this head.\r\n\r\n43. (p. 163)--People from St. Malo, France. Spelled also by Biard,\r\n_post_, Malouines.\r\n\r\n44.

See Parkman's\r\n_Pioneers_, pp. 265, 290; also, Lescarbot's reference to him, _ante_.\r\n\r\n45. (p. 181)--Referring to Queen Blanche of Castile (1187-1252), regent\r\nafter the death of her husband, Louis VIII., during the absence of her\r\nson, Louis IX. (Saint Louis), in the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n46. (p. 197)--Joseph Jouvency (also written Juvency, Jouvenci, and\r\nJouvancy), Jesuit historian, an eminent litterateur of his time. Born\r\nin Paris, September 14, 1643; died at Rome, May 29, 1719. In 1659,\r\nhe was admitted to the Society of Jesus, for many years filling the\r\nposition of professor of rhetoric at La Flèche, and devoting much time\r\nto historical and classical research. After taking his vows in 1677,\r\nhe was sent to Rome, as one of the staff of writers upon _Historia\r\nSocietatis Jesu_.\r\n\r\n47. (p. 197)--Count Ernest von Mansfeld, soldier of fortune,\r\nconspicuous in the Thirty Years War. Born, 1585; died, 1626, soon after\r\nhis defeat by Wallenstein at the bridge of Dessau. His great army of\r\nmercenaries was, according to Motley (_John of Barneveld,_ vol. ii.,\r\np. 32), \"the earliest type, perhaps, of the horrible military vermin\r\ndestined to feed so many years on the unfortunate dismembered carcass\r\nof Germany.\" Cf. Kohlrausch's _History of Germany_ (Haas trans.), pp.\r\n320, 326. Concerning the campaign of Louis XIII., against the Huguenots\r\n(1622), and Count von Mansfeld's part therein, see Kitchin's _History\r\nof France_, pp. 497, 498.\r\n\r\n48. (p. 199)--Philip Alegambe, a Jesuit scholar (Flemish). Died in\r\n1652, while superior of the house of his order at Rome. He was the\r\nleading writer upon _Bibliotheca Scriptorum Societatis Jesu_ (1643).\r\n\r\n49. (p. 219)--_Seven Islands._ A group at the mouth of the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver, near the northerly shore of the gulf.\r\n\r\n50. (p. 219)--Chicoutimi River, rising in numerous small lakes near\r\nLake St. John, pursues a picturesque course, frequently interrupted by\r\nrapids, eastward and northeastward into the Saguenay. At the junction,\r\nseventy-five miles above the mouth of the latter, is now the important\r\nlumber-shipping port of Chicoutimi, at whose wharves ocean-going\r\nvessels are laden. The old missionary district of that name included\r\nthe rugged country lying south and southwest of Lake St. John.\r\n\r\n51. (p. 221)--The French Jesuits definitely abandoned the Iroquois\r\nfield in 1687, owing to the rising power of the English. In 1701,\r\nBruyas was again on the ground, being joined the year following by\r\nDe Lamberville, Garnier, and Le Valliant, and later by D'Hue and De\r\nMarieul. The entire party was driven out in 1708, and many of their\r\nIroquois converts retired with them to the mission of Caughnawaga, near\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\n52. (p. 221)--The Iroquois Mission of St. Francis Xavier was founded in\r\n1669 by Iroquois Christians,--emigrants from the \"castles\" of the Five\r\nNations. The mission was finally removed to Sault St. Louis, on the St.\r\nLawrence, and called Caughnawaga, from the Indian village of that name\r\non the Mohawk, where had also been a Jesuit mission.\r\n\r\n53. (p. 221)--Lake Michigan. Called Lac des Puants on Champlain's map\r\nof 1632, in reference to the Winnebago tribe (Puants) on Green Bay; in\r\nseveral of the _Relations_, and on Marquette's map (1674), it is styled\r\nLac des Illinois, from the Illinois Indians upon its southern coast;\r\nAllouez calls it (1675) Lac St. Joseph, because of Fort and River St.\r\nJosephs on the southeast coast; Coronelli's map (1688) honors the\r\nDauphin by calling the lake after him; Hennepin comes the nearest to\r\nmodern usage, in his name, Michigonong.\r\n\r\n54. (p. 221)--Lake Huron, which has figured under many titles, in the\r\nold maps and chronicles. This name has reference to the Indian family\r\nupon its eastern shores. Champlain first named it La Mer Douce, (\"The\r\nFresh Sea\"), and later Lac des Attigouantan, after the chief tribe of\r\nthe Hurons; Sanson's map (1657) names it Karegnondi; Coronelli's map\r\n(1688) christens it Lac d'Orleans; Colden in one place gives it as\r\nQuatoghe, and in another as Caniatare. Lac des Hurons first appears in\r\nthe map accompanying the _Relation_ for 1670-71.\r\n\r\n55. (p. 221)--The mission of St. Ignace was founded by Marquette, in\r\n1670, on Point St. Ignace, on the mainland north of and opposite the\r\nIsland of Michillimackinac (now shortened to Mackinaw or Mackinac, as\r\nfancy dictates). The term Michillimackinac, variously spelled, was\r\napplied by the earliest French not only to the island and straits of\r\nthat name, but in general to the great peninsula lying north of the\r\nstraits.\r\n\r\n56. (p. 221)--The mission of Sault Ste. Marie, at the outlet of Lake\r\nSuperior, was founded by Raimbault and Jogues in 1640. The place was\r\nalways an important rallying-point for the natives, and naturally\r\nbecame the center of a wide-spreading fur trade, which lasted, under\r\nFrench, English, and American dominations in turn, until about 1840.\r\n\r\n57. (p. 221)--The Western mission of St. Francis Xavier was founded by\r\nAllouez in 1669, at the first rapids in the Fox River (of Green Bay),\r\non the east side of the river, in what is now the city of Depere, Wis.\r\nAn important Indian village had from the earliest historic times been\r\nlocated there.\r\n\r\n58. (p. 223)--Outaouaki = Ottawas; Puteatamis = Pottawattomies;\r\nKikarous = Kickapoos; Outagamies = Foxes; Oumiamis = Miamis.\r\n\r\n59. (p. 223)--Bayagoulas, one of the Louisiana missions, of which\r\nFather Paul du Ru, S. J., was in charge in 1700. Shea's _Catholic\r\nMissions_, p. 443.\r\n\r\n60. (p. 227)--An anonymous writer in _The Catholic World_, (vol. xii.,\r\np. 629) makes the statement that Quentin and Du Thet were sent out to\r\nreplace Biard and Massé \"if they had perished; otherwise to return to\r\nFrance.\" Contemporary writers, however, speak of their coming as a\r\nreinforcement.\r\n\r\n61. (p. 227)--On what came to be known as Frenchman's Bay, on the east\r\nside of the island of Mount Desert. Parkman says (_Pioneers_, ed. 1865,\r\np. 276, _note_): \"Probably all of Frenchman's Bay was included under\r\nthe name of the Harbor of St. Sauveur. The landing-place so called\r\nseems to have been near the entrance of the bay, certainly south of Bar\r\nHarbor. The Indian name of the Island of Mount Desert was Penetic. Its\r\npresent name was given by Champlain.\"\r\n\r\n62. (p. 227)--The \"Jonas,\" conspicuous in the annals of Acadia from the\r\ntime in which Poutrincourt and Lescarbot sailed in her for Port Royal,\r\nin 1606, to her capture by Argall in 1613. Parkman aptly calls her \"the\r\n'Mayflower' of the Jesuits.\"\r\n\r\n63. (p. 229)--Samuel Argall, born in Bristol, England, 1572; died,\r\n1639. See Cooke's _Virginia_ (Amer. Commonwealths ser.), pp. 111-113,\r\nfor a fair estimate of this tempestuous character. Folsom's \"Expedition\r\nof Captain Samuel Argal,\" to _N. Y. Hist. Colls._ (new ser.); vol. i.,\r\npp. 333-342, goes over that ground quite completely.\r\n\r\n64. (p. 231)--Sir Thomas Dale, the predecessor of Argall as governor\r\nof Virginia; he was in the service of the Low Countries, 1588-95, and\r\n1606-10; in 1611, he entered the service of the Virginia Company, where\r\nhe remained five years as governor of the colony; and in 1619 he died\r\nat Masulipatam, while in command of an expedition to the East Indies.\r\n\r\n65. (p. 233)--The charge was freely made at the time, that Biard and\r\nMassé, incensed at Biencourt, who had been unkind to them, piloted\r\nArgall to Port Royal. Poutrincourt and Lescarbot, disliking the\r\nJesuits, naturally believed it, and the former addressed the French\r\nadmiralty court on the subject, under the date of July 18, 1614.--See\r\nLescarbot's _Nouv. France_, book v., chap. 14. Champlain discredited\r\nthe charge, saying that Argall compelled an Indian to serve as\r\npilot. Cf. Parkman's _Pioneers_, pp. 313 _et seq._, and Biard's\r\nown statements, _post_ (Letter to T.-R. Général, May 6, 1614; and\r\n_Relation_ of 1616).\r\n\r\n66. (p. 233)--Argall's lieutenant, in command of the captured \"Jonas.\"\r\nAccording to Parkman (_Pioneers_, p. 318), he was \"an officer of merit,\r\na scholar, and linguist,\" treating his prisoners with kindness.\r\n\r\n67. (p. 251)--Reference is here made to Lake Champlain, the Mer des\r\nIroquois and Lacus Irocoisiensis of the early French cartographers.\r\nRichelieu River was at first styled Rivière des Iroquois. In a letter\r\nof John Winthrop to Lord Arlington, dated Boston, Oct. 25, 1666, Lake\r\nChamplain is referred to as Lake Hiracoies.--_N. Y. Colon. Docs._,\r\niii., p. 138. See also, Palmer's _History of Lake Champlain_ (Albany,\r\n1866), pp. 12, 13; and Blaeu's maps of 1662 and 1685, in Winsor's _N.\r\nand C. Hist._, vol. iv., p. 391.\r\n\r\n68. (p. 253)--The gar-pike (_Lepidosteus osseus_). A picture of this\r\n\"armored fish\" is given in Creuxius's _Historia Canadensis_ (Paris,\r\n1664), p. 50.\r\n\r\n69. (p. 253)--Jouvency plainly refers to what is still known as Bird\r\nIsland, of Bird Rocks, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, N. W. of Cabot\r\nStrait. Authorities disagree in locating the Bird Island of Cartier's\r\nfirst voyage. See _Hakluyt's Voyages_ (Goldsmid ed.), vol. xiii.,\r\npt. i, p. 78; Shea's _Charlevoix_, vol. i., p. 112, _note;_ both\r\nindicating that what is now called Funk Island, off the eastern coast\r\nof Newfoundland, was the Bird Island of Cartier. Kingsford, in _History\r\nof Canada_ (Toronto, 1887), vol. i., p. 3, identifies it, however, with\r\nthe present Bird Island of the Gulf. Champlain's map of 1613 has a Bird\r\nIsland near the mouth of the Bay of Fundy. Anspach, in _History of\r\nNewfoundland_ (London, 1819), p. 317, says: \"Fogo Island [N. W. of Cape\r\nFreels] is described in the old maps by the name of Aves, or Birds'\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\n70. (p. 269)--The Montagnais, a wretched tribe of nomads, were, at this\r\ntime, chiefly centered upon the banks of the Saguenay River.\r\n\r\n71.
