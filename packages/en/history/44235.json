He however retained a body of\r\ntroops, and proposed that the chiefs should co-operate with him in\r\nreducing Sinigaglia, which was held by the late Prefect's widow.\r\nAccordingly, Paolo Orsini, his relation the Duke of Gravina,\r\nVitellozzo, and Liverotto advanced upon that town, the garrison of\r\nwhich was commanded by the celebrated Andrea Doria. This remarkable\r\nman, finding himself excluded by the state of parties at Genoa\r\nfrom all prospect of preferment, had in youth adopted the career\r\nof a condottiere. He took service with Giovanni della Rovere,\r\ndistinguishing himself greatly in the campaign of Charles VIII. at\r\nNaples; after which he continued attached to the Prefect and his\r\nwidow, with a hundred light horse. Seeing the case of Sinigaglia\r\ndesperate, and dreading Liverotto's bitter hatred of the Rovere\r\nrace, he retired, having first sent off the Prefectess on horseback\r\nto Florence, disguised as a friar. On the 28th of December, the\r\nassailants took undisputed possession of the city, and sacked it.\r\nHis prey now in his toils, Valentino, who had lulled their suspicion\r\nby keeping aloof with his troops in Romagna, flew to the spot on the\r\npretext of reducing the citadel, and on the 31st arrived at the town\r\nwith a handful of cavalry.\r\n\r\nHe was met three miles outside of the gate by the chiefs, and\r\nimmediately requested their attendance in the house of one Bernardino\r\ndi Parma, to receive his congratulations and thanks on their success.\r\nAt the same time he desired quarters to be provided for their\r\nrespective followings outside of the city, in order to admit his own\r\narmy, amounting to two thousand cavalry and ten thousand infantry.\r\nStartled at the appearance of a force so disproportioned to the\r\nservice in hand, they would gladly have demurred to this distribution\r\nof the troops, but Cesare had contrived that there should be no\r\nopportunity for remonstrance, and resistance would have obviously\r\nbeen too late. Affecting a confidence they were far from feeling, the\r\nleaders accepted the invitation, and were received with cordiality\r\nand distinction. After an interchange of compliments, Borgia withdrew\r\nupon some pretext, when there immediately entered his chosen agent\r\nof iniquity, Don Michelotto, with several armed followers, who,\r\nafter some resistance, arrested the Duke of Gravina, Paolo Orsini,\r\nVitellozzo, and Liverotto, with some ten others. Before morning the\r\ntwo last were strangled with a Pisan cord, or violin-string, and a\r\nwrench-pin, by the hands of that monster, in his master's presence.\r\nTheir death, according to Machiavelli, was cowardly, especially that\r\nof the blood-stained Liverotto; and their bodies, after being dragged\r\nround the piazza, were exposed for three days before burial.\r\n\r\nThat night Valentino, at the head of his Gascons, attacked six\r\nthousand of these captains' troops, which had not dispersed on\r\nhearing the capture of their leaders, slaughtering and plundering\r\nthem with the same barbarity they had themselves used towards the\r\ncitizens. The greater portion were cut to pieces, and those who\r\nescaped reached their homes naked, having only straw tied round their\r\nlegs. Fabio Orsini was saved by his accidental absence from Borgia's\r\nlevee; Petrucci and Baglioni, suspicious of treachery, had avoided\r\ntheir fate by previously retiring home. Against the last of these,\r\nBorgia marched in a few days, carrying with him the remaining chiefs,\r\nof whom he reserved the Orsini until he should hear his father's\r\nintentions; but each night after supper he is said to have had one\r\nof the others brought out, and put to a cruel death before him. Thus\r\ndid he, by a dexterous stroke of the most refined duplicity, turn the\r\ntools of his ambition into victims of his vengeance, and at the same\r\ntime ridded himself of faithless adherents, whom any change in his\r\nfortune would have again converted into overt and implacable foes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Our chief authorities for this tragic scene are\r\nMachiavelli's despatches and separate narrative, with the Diaries of\r\nBurchard, Buonaccorsi, and Sanuto. Some details are taken from the\r\nRicordi of Padre Gratio, guardian of the Monastery delle Grazie at\r\nSinigaglia, a contemporary, and probably an eye-witness to many of\r\nthem. Vat. Urb. MSS. 1023, art. 17.[*A]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *A: Cf. MADIAI, _Diario delle Cose di Urbino_,\r\nin _Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_, tom. III., p. 437.\r\nMachiavelli, who was with Cesare at the time, describes the massacre\r\nof Sinigaglia as \"il bellissimo inganno di Sinigaglia.\" Cesare wrote\r\nan account of it to Isabella d'Este. Cf. her letter to her husband\r\n(D'ARCO, _Notizie di Isabella Estense_, in _Arch. St. Ital._, ser. i.,\r\nApp., vol. I., No. II. (1845), p. 262).]\r\n\r\nVermiglioli, in his life of Malatesta Baglioni, has printed, from\r\nthe archives of Perugia, a letter from Borgia to the magistrates of\r\nthat city, which, in consideration of the comparative obscurity of\r\nthat interesting volume, we shall here translate. It is, perhaps, the\r\nonly known document fully stating the case of the writer, and so may\r\nbe regarded as his defence from the charges we have brought against\r\nhim: the style and orthography are remarkably rude; and the matter\r\nabounds in that common expedient, whereby bold and bad men seek to\r\nevade merited accusations, by throwing them upon those they have\r\noutraged.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Our version is from the original letter. Nearly similar\r\nin purport, but much shorter, is a despatch written by him to the\r\nDoge of Venice on the very night of the raid, so anxious was he to\r\nconciliate the Signory.]\r\n\r\n     \"Magnificent and potent Lords, my special Friends and\r\n     Brothers;\r\n\r\n     \"Superfluous were it to narrate from their outset the\r\n     perfidious rebellion and atrocious treason, so known to\r\n     yourselves and to all the world, and so detestable, which\r\n     your [lords, the Baglioni,] and their accomplices have\r\n     committed against his Holiness the Pope and ourselves.\r\n     And although all were our vassals, and most of them in\r\n     our pay, received and caressed by us as sons or brothers,\r\n     and favoured with high promotion, they nevertheless,\r\n     regardless of the kindness of his Holiness and our own,\r\n     as of their individual honour, banded in schemes of\r\n     overweening ambition, and blinded by greed of tyranny,\r\n     have failed us at the moment of our utmost need, turning\r\n     his Holiness' arms and ours against him and ourselves,\r\n     for the overthrow of our sovereignty and person. They\r\n     commenced their aggressions upon us by raising our\r\n     states of Urbino, Camerino, and Montefeltro, throwing\r\n     all Romagna into confusion by force and by seditious\r\n     plots, and proceeding under the mask of reconciliation to\r\n     fresh offences, until our new levies were brought up in\r\n     irresistible force. And so atrocious was their baseness,\r\n     that neither the beneficent clemency of his [Holiness]\r\n     aforesaid, nor our renewed indulgence to them, weaned them\r\n     from the slough of their first vile designs, in which\r\n     they still persisted. And as soon as they learned the\r\n     departure of the French troops on their return towards\r\n     Lombardy, whereby they deemed us weakened and left with no\r\n     effective force, they, feigning an urgent desire to aid\r\n     in our attack upon Sinigaglia, mustered a third only of\r\n     their infantry, and concealed the remainder in the houses\r\n     about, with instructions to draw together at nightfall,\r\n     and unite with the men-at-arms, whom they had posted in\r\n     the neighbourhood, meaning, at a given moment, to throw\r\n     the infantry, through the garrison (with whom they had an\r\n     understanding), upon the new town, in the narrow space\r\n     whereof they calculated upon our being lodged with few\r\n     attendants, and so to complete their long-nourished plans\r\n     by crushing us at unawares. But we, distinctly forewarned\r\n     of all, so effectively and quickly anticipated them, that\r\n     we at once made prisoners of the Duke of Gravina, Paolo\r\n     Orsini, Vitellozzo of Castello, and Liverotto of Fermo,\r\n     and discovered, sacked, and overthrew their foot and\r\n     horse, whether concealed or not; whereupon the castellan,\r\n     seeing the plot defeated, quickly surrendered the fortress\r\n     at discretion. And this we have done, under pressure\r\n     of necessity imposed by the measures of these persons\r\n     aforesaid, and in order to make an end of the unmeasured\r\n     perfidy and villanies of them and their coadjutors,\r\n     thereby restraining their boundless ambition and insensate\r\n     cupidity, which were truly a public nuisance to the nations\r\n     of Italy. Thus your highnesses have good cause for great\r\n     rejoicing at your deliverance from these dangers. And on\r\n     your highnesses' account, I am now, by his Holiness's\r\n     commands, to march with my army, for the purpose of\r\n     rescuing you from the rapacious and sanguinary oppression\r\n     whereby you have been vexed, and to restore you to free\r\n     and salutary obedience to his Holiness and the Apostolic\r\n     See, with the maintenance of your wonted privileges. For\r\n     the which causes, We, as Gonfaloniere and Captain of his\r\n     Holiness and the aforesaid See, exhort, recommend, and\r\n     command you, on receipt hereof, to free yourselves from\r\n     all other yoke, and to send ambassadors to lay before his\r\n     Holiness your dutiful and unreserved obedience: which\r\n     failing, we are commanded to reduce you by force to that\r\n     duty,--an event that would distress us on account of the\r\n     serious injuries which must thereby result to your people,\r\n     for whom we have, from our boyhood, borne and still bear\r\n     singular favour. From Corinaldo, the 2d of January, 1503.\r\n\r\n     \"CESARE BORGIA OF FRANCE, DUKE OF ROMAGNA AND\r\n     VALENTINO, PRINCE OF ADRIA AND VENAFRA, LORD OF\r\n     PIOMBINO, Gonfaloniere and Captain-General of the Holy\r\n     Roman Church.\"\r\n\r\nNews of the Sinigaglia tragedy reached the Pope late in the evening,\r\nand he instantly communicated to Cardinal Orsini that Cesare had\r\ntaken that city, assured that an early visit of congratulation from\r\nhis Eminence would follow. The Cardinal was perhaps the richest and\r\nmost influential of his house. He chiefly had organised the league\r\nof La Magione, but having always contrived to keep on good terms\r\nwith Alexander, he believed in the professions of regard with which\r\nhis Holiness subsequently seduced him from that policy, and thence\r\nreposed in him a fatal confidence. Next morning he rode in state to\r\npay his respects at the Vatican, where his own person and those of\r\nhis principal relations were instantly seized, whilst his magnificent\r\npalace at Monte Giordano was pillaged by orders and for the benefit\r\nof the Pontiff. After an imprisonment of some weeks, he was cut off\r\nby slow poison, prescribed from the same quarter, and died on the 22d\r\nof February. Thus did the Pope set his seal of approval on his son's\r\natrocities, which he justified by a poor and pointless jest, avowing\r\nthat as the confederates of La Magione, after stipulating that they\r\nshould not be required to re-enter the service of Valentino unless\r\nsingly, had thought fit to place themselves within his power _en\r\nmasse_, they merited their fate as forsworn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF SIGNATURES\r\n\r\n[1. 1480]\r\n\r\n[2. 1494]\r\n\r\n[3. 1501]\r\n\r\n[4. 1504]\r\n\r\n[5. 1501]\r\n\r\n[6. 1510]\r\n\r\n[7. 1522]\r\n\r\n[8. 1540]\r\n\r\n[9. 1517]]\r\n\r\nThe massacre of Sinigaglia has been condemned by every writer except\r\nMachiavelli, and posterity has in severe retribution suspected him\r\nof abetting it. This charge possesses a twofold interest, as\r\ninculpating the character of the historian, and as affecting the\r\nmorality of the age.[*3] In the latter view alone does it fall under\r\nour consideration: yet however horrible these wholesale murders, they\r\nare more remarkable in Italian history as the crowning crime of an\r\nambitious career, and as widely influencing the political aspect of\r\nRomagna and La Marca, than from their relative enormity. The fates\r\nof the young Astorre Manfredi of Faenza, of Fogliano of Fermo, of\r\nthe Lord of Camerino and his three sons, have all been mentioned in\r\nthese pages as occurring within a year or two of this event. It would\r\nbe easy to swell the catalogue of slaughter; and we find Baglioni\r\nand Vitellozzo both classed with Cesare himself in the category\r\nof murder, by a chronicler of Alexander VI., who also quotes from\r\nthe mouth of Giovanni Bentivoglio, at the diet of La Magione, this\r\nbravado, \"I shall assassinate Duke Valentino should I be so lucky as\r\nto have opportunity.\"[4] The spirit of the age is further illustrated\r\nby its unnumbered poisonings: and the fact that Machiavelli should\r\nneither have used his influence with Valentino to avert the massacre\r\nof the confederates, nor his pen to brand the treachery of that foul\r\ndeed, is but another link in the evidence from which we may deduce\r\nthe total extinction of moral feeling, which, anticipating the worst\r\ndoctrines of Loyola, carried them out with a selfishness, falsehood,\r\nand cruelty unparalleled in the annals of human civilisation.[*5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *3: It is unlikely that Machiavelli abetted the massacre,\r\nthough he certainly approved it dispassionately enough. By it the\r\nPapacy was rid at last of the houses of Colonna and Orsini. Cesare\r\nmet Machiavelli after the affair \"with the best cheer in the world,\"\r\nreminding him that he had given him a hint of his intentions, but\r\nadding, \"I did not tell you all.\" He urged on Machiavelli his\r\ndesire for a firm alliance with Florence. Cf. MACHIAVELLI,\r\n_Legazione al Valentino_, Lett. 86, and the _Modo tenuto dal Duca\r\nValentino nel ammazzare Vitellozzo_. See also CREIGHTON,\r\n_op. cit._, vol V., p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: VERMIGLIOLI: _Vita di Malatesta Baglioni_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *5: The schemes of Cesare were in his age no more\r\nunscrupulously carried out than Bismarck's in his. \"It is well,\" said\r\nCesare, \"to beguile those who have shown themselves to be masters of\r\ntreachery.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nIL CASTELLO DI SINIGAGLIA]\r\n\r\nGianpaolo Baglioni having fled to Siena, Valentino followed him in\r\nthat direction, after taking possession of Perugia, and learning\r\nthat Città di Castello, abandoned by the adherents of the Vitelli,\r\nhad been plundered by his own partizans. On the 18th of January,\r\nhearing at Città della Pieve of the blow struck by his father against\r\nthe Orsini, and that Fabio, who escaped the snare at Sinigaglia,\r\nwas ravaging the Campagna, he handed over Paolo and the Duke of\r\nGravina to the tender mercies of Michelotto, whose noose quickly\r\nencircled their necks. Invading the Sienese, he carried fire and\r\nsword by Chiusi as far as Pienza and San Quirico, massacring even\r\nthe aged and infirm with horrible tortures. His real object, besides\r\nrevenging himself upon Petrucci and Baglioni, was to add Siena to his\r\nterritory, but his position being then a delicate one with France, he\r\naccepted the proposal of that republic to purchase safety, by exiling\r\nPetrucci their seigneur, and dismissing Baglioni their guest.[*6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *6: Cf. LISINI, _Cesare Borgia e la repubblica di\r\nSiena_, in the _Boll. Senese di Stor. Pat._, ann. VII. (fasc. I.),\r\npp. 114, 115, and 144 _et seq._ for all the documents. And for a\r\nshort but excellent account in English of the whole Sienese affair,\r\nLANGTON DOUGLAS, _A History of Siena_ (Murray, 1902), p. 206\r\n_et seq._]\r\n\r\nThis series of rapid successes is ascribed by Machiavelli to the\r\npolicy of Valentino in ridding himself of his French auxiliaries and\r\nhis mercenary confederates, and so being enabled, during the brief\r\nremainder of his career, to give his talents and energy full scope in\r\nthe conduct of an army entirely devoted to his views. His conquests\r\nhad now extended along the eastern fall of the Apennines, from\r\nImola to Camerino, and included the upper vale of the Tiber and the\r\nprincipality of Piombino. He had but to add to them Siena, and the\r\nbest part of Central Italy from sea to sea would be his own. The eyes\r\nof Louis, at length opened to a danger which he had so long fostered,\r\nwere not blinded by Cesare's affected moderation in claiming his\r\nrecent acquisitions rather for the Church than for himself, and that\r\nmonarch hastened to caution him from further hostilities against\r\nTuscany. The successes of Fabio Orsini around Rome at the same time\r\ncalled for his presence, so he changed his route to make a foray\r\nupon the holdings of that family about the Lake of Bracciano, with\r\nwhom the Colonna and Savelli had united against their common enemies\r\nthe Borgia. This opportunity was greedily seized by the Pontiff to\r\ncarry out his long cherished policy of breaking the power of the\r\ngreat barons, and the castles of the Orsini having one after another\r\nbeen reduced, their influence ceased for the future to be formidable\r\neither to their sovereign or their neighbours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it is time we should return to Urbino, where we left the\r\ncitizens bewailing the departure of their Duke. As soon as he was\r\ngone, Antonio di S. Savino took possession of the place in name of\r\nValentino, and issued a proclamation enjoining the townsfolk to\r\ndisarm, the peasantry to return home, and all to surrender whatever\r\nthey had stolen the day before from the palace. In the afternoon,\r\nafter a conciliatory harangue to the people, he took his lodging\r\nin the palace. Next morning, after mass, the Bishop published a\r\ngeneral amnesty, and oaths of allegiance to the new sovereign were\r\nadministered. Towards evening the bells were rung, and a bonfire was\r\nlit in the piazza; but these were heartless and forced rejoicings,\r\nand no bribes could induce even the children to raise the cry of\r\n\"Valenza.\" Nor was this sadness without cause, for the soldiery of\r\nOrsini and Vitellozzo, who still quartered in the town, treated all\r\nwith such outrage, that many of the inhabitants prayed for death\r\nto close their sufferings, envying those who were summoned from\r\nsuch scenes of misery. But when the troops were withdrawn, the mild\r\ncharacter and popular manners of Antonio the governor, skilfully\r\nseconding the conciliatory policy which Borgia had resolved upon,\r\ngave matters another aspect, and occasioned surprise to those who\r\nknew the cruel perfidy of their new master. Various notorious abuses\r\nwere put down under severe penalties, especially the acceptance\r\nof presents by judges, and the following up of private vengeance.\r\nThe deputy governor, Giovanni da Forlì, was however a man of quite\r\nopposite temperament, whose harshness soon counteracted these gentler\r\ninfluences, and occasioned general disgust. But the people heard\r\nwith satisfaction the tragedy of Sinigaglia; for to the perfidy\r\nof the chiefs and the brutality of their army, the loss of their\r\nindependence and the whole of their late misfortunes were unanimously\r\nascribed; and a permission to ravage the territory of the Vitelli,\r\nnow publicly proclaimed throughout the duchy, was by many greedily\r\nseized.\r\n\r\nBorgia, having secured fourteen distinguished inhabitants of Urbino\r\nas hostages, ordered that the fortresses left by agreement in\r\nthe hands of Guidobaldo should be attempted: that of Maiuolo was\r\naccordingly surprised about the beginning of May, and easily reduced.\r\nS. Leo being better provided, as well as considered impregnable,\r\nits siege was more methodically undertaken, and levies were ordered\r\nto reinforce the assailants. The amount of public sympathy with the\r\ncause may be estimated from Baldi's assertion that, in the city of\r\nUrbino, the utmost difficulty was experienced in raising eight foot\r\nsoldiers with one month's pay. Eight hundred Gascons in the French\r\nservice were obtained from De la Tremouille; but these, having\r\nturned the siege into a sort of blockade, were dispersed among the\r\nneighbouring villages, where, on the 5th of June, their revels\r\nwere suddenly interrupted by unknown assailants, who disappeared\r\nas mysteriously as they had issued from the mountain defiles,\r\nleaving many of the besiegers slain or wounded. The surrounding\r\npeasantry, catching the enthusiasm, rushed to arms, and, but for\r\nextraordinary exertions, the whole duchy would have once more\r\nbeen out for their legitimate lord. News of this movement having\r\nreached the Duke early in July, he obtained from Florence free\r\npassage through her territory, and from the Venetians a promise of\r\npassive support, and thereupon put himself into communication with\r\nhis principal adherents, by means of letters carried by persons of\r\nlow condition, many of which were unfortunately intercepted by the\r\nlieutenant-governor of Urbino. His people were thus kept in a fever\r\nof expectation; but, finally, this plan of an invasion was abandoned,\r\nwhereupon he repaired to Mantua, to his brother-in-law the Marquis,\r\nwho had been taken into the French service under De la Tremouille,\r\nand engaged him to represent to Louis the hardships of his case, and\r\nthe danger of Borgia's excessive ambition.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with their ignominious overthrow at S. Leo, the Gascons\r\nassumed the habitual licence of such mercenaries, by soon taking\r\ntheir departure from\r\n\r\n     \"The tentless rest beneath the humid sky,\r\n     The stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,\r\n     And palls the patience of his baffled heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe siege was nevertheless maintained by the commandant of Romagna;\r\nbut the place was ably and spiritedly defended by Ottaviano Fregoso,\r\nwho will soon attract our notice in other scenes. Marini has recorded\r\nanother act of romantic daring by the same Brizio who, in the\r\npreceding year, had surprised the place. Fregoso's tiny garrison\r\nbeing greatly exhausted by the long blockade, he, with one Marzio,\r\nmade his way, during a violent storm of rain, over the rocks, and\r\nthrough the beleaguering force, and reached a castle near Mantua\r\nwhere Guidobaldo then was. In vain these emissaries besought him for\r\na reinforcement of two hundred men; for, thinking it would only waste\r\ntheir gallantry by prolonging a hopeless struggle, he thankfully\r\ndeclined their proposal. At length their urgency obtained twenty-five\r\nmen who happened to be at hand, and with these they returned to\r\nthe leaguer. Marzio, boldly presenting himself to the commandant,\r\nvolunteered to join the besiegers with his little party, which being\r\naccepted, he advanced them under the walls, whence, having been\r\nrecognised by the garrison, they made a rush to the upper gate,\r\nand were received into the fortress ere the trick was discovered.\r\nBy this timely succour, S. Leo was enabled to hold out until the\r\nrestoration of its rightful sovereign; and its brave defenders did\r\nnot even falter at the threat of summary vengeance upon their wives\r\nand families, who had been brought to the palace of Urbino to answer\r\nfor their obstinacy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChristendom was now to be appalled by a fearful catastrophe, which\r\nfitly closed the career of the Borgias, diverting their wonted\r\nweapons to their own destruction, for--\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis sure a law of retribution just\r\n     That turns the plotters' arts against themselves.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7:\r\n\r\n     \"Neque enim lex æquior ulla\r\n     Quam necis artifices arte perire sua.\" OVID. _Ar. Amat._ i. 655.]\r\n\r\nAlexander and his son perceiving that they could no longer turn to\r\ngood account the co-operation of Louis for their grasping schemes,\r\nbegan to look round for new combinations: having squeezed the orange\r\nthey were ready to throw aside the rind. But to such projects their\r\nexhausted treasury offered serious obstacles. To supply it they\r\nhad recourse, on an extended scale, to an expedient which they had\r\ninvented, and already occasionally employed,--that of poisoning the\r\nrichest cardinals, seizing on their treasures, and selling their\r\nvacant hats to the highest bidders. Among the most recent and wealthy\r\nof the sacred college was Adrian of Corneto, and he was therefore\r\nselected as next victim. On the 12th of August, the Pope and Cesare\r\ninvited him to sup in the Belvidere casino of the Vatican, and the\r\nlatter sent forward a supply of poisoned wine, in charge of his\r\nbutler, with strict injunctions not to serve it until specially\r\ndesired by himself. Several other cardinals were to partake of the\r\nbanquet, and, probably, were intended to share the drugged potion.\r\nAlexander had been assured by an astrologer that, so long as he had\r\nabout him the sacramental wafer, he should not die; and, accordingly,\r\nhe constantly carried it in a little golden box; but, having on that\r\nevening forgotten it upon his toilet, he sent Monsignor Caraffa,\r\nafterwards Paul IV., to fetch it. Meanwhile, overcome by the dog-day\r\nheat, he called for wine. The butler was gone to fetch a salver of\r\npeaches, which had been presented to his Holiness, and his deputy,\r\nhaving received no instructions as to the medicated bottles, offered\r\na draught from them to the Pope. He greedily swallowed it, and his\r\nexample was more moderately followed by Cesare; thus,\r\n\r\n                         \"Even-handed justice\r\n     Commends the ingredients of the poisoned chalice\r\n     To their own lips.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had they taken their seats at the table, when the two\r\nvictims successively fell down insensible, from the virulence of the\r\npoison, and were carried to bed. The Pontiff rallied so far as to\r\nrecover consciousness, and to linger for about a week, but at length\r\nsank under the shock and the fever which supervened, his age being\r\nseventy-one, and his constitution enervated by long debauchery. The\r\nlast sacraments were duly administered, and it was remarked that,\r\nduring his illness, he never alluded to his children Cesare and\r\nLucrezia, through life the objects of an overweening, if not criminal\r\nfondness, in whose behalf most of his outrages upon the peace and the\r\nrights of mankind had been committed. His death occurred on the 18th\r\nof August.[*8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *8: There is no authentic basis for this story. Rome was\r\nin a pestilential condition in August, and the Pope, Cesare, and\r\nthe Cardinal Hadrian were all stricken with fever, which a supper\r\nin the open air was surely not unlikely to produce. Alexander was\r\nso detested that the strangeness of his death suggested poison at\r\nonce to his enemies. Cf. CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., p.\r\n49. An excellent essay on _The Poisonings attributed to the Borgia_\r\nwill be found in CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., p. 301 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of this awful retribution given by Tommasi,\r\nfrom which most other narratives but slightly deviate as to dates\r\nor immaterial details. Another version, however, occurs in Sanuto's\r\nDiaries, which, being contemporary, and probably supplied from the\r\ndiplomatic correspondence of the Signory, merits notice, and has\r\nnot been hitherto published. The Cardinal of Corneto, who figures\r\nprominently in this narrative, was made collector for Peter's pence\r\nin England, and Bishop of Hereford, from whence he was translated\r\nto Bath and Wells. We shall find him compromised in Petrucci's\r\nconspiracy against Leo X., but the following charge of pope-poisoning\r\nis new.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Adrian Castillense of Corneto, Cardinal Datary, having\r\nbeen desired by the Pope to receive him and Duke Valentino at supper\r\nin his vineyard, his Holiness supplying the eatables, this Cardinal\r\npresumed the invitation to be planned for his death by poison, so\r\nthat the Duke might obtain his money and benefices, which were\r\nconsiderable. In order to save himself there seemed but one course,\r\nso, watching his opportunity, he summoned the Pontiff's steward,\r\nwhom he knew intimately, and on his arrival received him alone in\r\na private chamber, where 10,000 ducats were laid out: these he\r\ndesired him to accept for love of him, offering him also more of his\r\nproperty, which he declared he could continue to enjoy only through\r\nhis assistance, and adding, 'You certainly are aware of the Pope's\r\ndisposition, and I know that he and the Duke have designed my death\r\nby poison through you; wherefore I pray you have pity on me and spare\r\nmy life.' The steward, moved with compassion on hearing this, at\r\nlength avowed the plan concerted for administering the poison; that,\r\nafter the supper, he was to serve three boxes of confections, one\r\nfor the Pope, another for the Duke, and a third for the Cardinal,\r\nthe last being poisoned; so they arranged that the service of the\r\ntable should be contrived in such a way that the Pontiff might eat\r\nof the Cardinal's poisoned box, and die. On the appointed day, the\r\nPope having arrived at the vineyard with the Duke, the Cardinal\r\nthrew himself at his Holiness' feet and kissed them, saying he had\r\na boon to request, and would not rise until it were granted. The\r\nPope assuring him of his consent, he continued, 'Holy Father! on the\r\nlord's coming to his servant's house, it is not meet that the servant\r\nshould sit with his lord; and the just and proper favour I ask is\r\npermission for the servant to wait at the table of your Holiness.'\r\nThe supper being thus served, and the moment arrived for giving the\r\nconfections, the box having been poisoned by the steward as directed\r\nby the Pope, the Cardinal placed it before his Holiness, who, relying\r\non his steward, and convinced of the Cardinal's sincerity by his\r\nservice, ate joyfully of this box, as did the Cardinal of the other,\r\nwhich the Pontiff believed the poisoned one. Thereafter, at the hour\r\nwhen from its nature the poison took effect, his Holiness began to\r\nfeel it, and thus he died: the Cardinal being still alarmed, took\r\nmedicine and an emetic, and was easily cured.\"\r\n\r\nThe death of Alexander by poison is generally credited, although\r\nRaynaldus and Muratori, willing to mitigate so heinous a scandal,\r\nincline to the few and obscure authorities who attribute it to\r\ntertian fever. It was natural that the truth should be glossed over,\r\nespecially in despatches addressed to the court of his daughter\r\nLucrezia, to which the latter annalist probably had access. But\r\nthough the earliest intelligence of the event forwarded by the\r\nVenetian envoy alludes to the Pope's seizure as fever, his subsequent\r\nletters, quoted by Sanuto, thus loathsomely confirm the current\r\nsuspicion of poison having been administered. \"On this day [19th] I\r\nsaw the Pontiff's corpse, whose apparel was not worth two ducats.\r\nHe was swollen beyond the size of one of our large wine-skins. Never\r\nsince the Christian era was a more horrible and terrible sight\r\nwitnessed. The blood flowed from ears, mouth, and nose faster than\r\nit could be wiped away; his lips were larger than a man's fist, and\r\nin his open mouth the blood boiled as in a caldron on the fire, and\r\nkept incessantly flowing as from a spout; all which I report from\r\nobservation.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: This passage appears conclusive as to the fact of poison\r\nhaving been taken by the Pontiff; and it will be observed that\r\nSanuto's story of the confection-boxes in no way accounts for the\r\nillness of Valentino, which is equally passed over in another totally\r\ndifferent statement of this affair, given in the Appendix to Ranke's\r\n_History of the Popes_, section i. No. 4,--omissions to be kept\r\nin view in testing the probability of these conflicting accounts.\r\nRoscoe seems to have subsequently abandoned the doubts thrown upon\r\nthe poisoning in his first edition, although ever prone to extenuate\r\nvices of the Borgia: witness his elaborate defence of Lucrezia, or\r\nhis views as to the Duke of Gandia's murder and the massacre of\r\nSinigaglia. Voltaire treats the question like a habitual doubter,\r\nwith the ingenuity of a critic rather than the matured judgment of a\r\nhistorian. He is answered, with perhaps unnecessary detail, by Masse,\r\nto whom Sanuto was unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe character of Alexander VI. as a man and as a sovereign admits of\r\nno question, and is thus forcibly summed up by Sismondi. \"He was the\r\nmost notoriously immoral man in Christendom; one whose debauchery\r\nno shame restrained, whose treaties no good faith sanctioned, whose\r\npolicy was never guarded by justice, to whose vengeance pity was\r\nunknown.\"[*10] As a pontiff he must be tried by a different test,\r\nand those ecclesiastical writers, who attempt not to defend his\r\nmorals or example, assert the orthodoxy of his faith and doctrine,\r\nand commend the wisdom of his provisions for maintenance of that\r\nreligion which regarded him as its head. He was the first to\r\nestablish the censorship of books,[*11] an important bulwark of the\r\nRoman Church; and among the orders which he instituted or protected\r\nwas that of S. Francesco di Paolo. Nor can it be doubted that his\r\nambitious nepotism eventually aggrandised the temporal possessions\r\nof the papacy, by quelling the mutinous barons of the Campagna, and\r\nby so crushing the more distant seigneurs as to render their states\r\na speedy and easy prey to Julius II. On the other hand, the openly\r\nsimoniacal practices which prevailed during his reign, the strong\r\nmeasures adopted to raise money for his private ends by a lavish\r\nscale of indulgences, and, generally, the unscrupulous employment of\r\nthe power of the keys and the treasures of the Church for unworthy\r\npurposes, all tended to alienate men's minds, and to stir those\r\ndoubts which the different, but not less injudicious, policy of his\r\nimmediate successors ripened into schism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *10: This is probably an exaggeration. Alexander VI. was\r\nwithout reticence in his sins, and so has not escaped whipping.

The Inquisition\r\nwas introduced into Italy in 1542, and the _Index Librorum\r\nProhibitorum_ was established. But the congregation of the Index\r\nwas not established till the Council of Trent. Magical books were\r\nprohibited as early as the Council of Nice, 325.]\r\n\r\nFavoured by youth, constitution, and energy of mind, Cesare Borgia\r\nwrestled successfully with the deadly ingredients which he had\r\ninadvertently swallowed. He is said to have been saved by being\r\nfrequently placed in the carcass of a newly-killed bullock or mule,\r\nand, whether in consequence of this treatment, or of the inflammatory\r\nnature of the potion, to have lost the whole skin of his body. He had\r\nflattered himself that, foreseeing every possible contingency which\r\nhis father's death could develop, he had so planned his measures\r\nas to secure, in any event, his own safety, and the maintenance of\r\nhis authority. But, never having anticipated being disabled from\r\naction at that very juncture, his well-laid schemes fell to the\r\nground, a signal illustration of the proverb, \"Man proposes, God\r\ndisposes.\" By means of Don Michelotto, he was, however, able to draw\r\nround the Vatican a body of twelve thousand devoted troops, and that\r\nunscrupulous agent executed his instructions by seizing about 500,000\r\nducats in money, jewels, and valuables, from the Pope's apartment,\r\nbefore his death was published.\r\n\r\nThe Diaries of Sanuto give a lively description of the immediate\r\neffects of Alexander's death on Lower Italy,--the exultations of the\r\npeople, the prompt movements of the Campagna barons, the hesitation\r\nof Valentino, the intrigues of the cardinals. As soon as the good\r\nnews transpired, Rome rose in arms against the Spaniards; and the\r\nColonna and the Orsini, entering at the head of their troops,\r\nwillingly aided in spoiling and slaughtering these countrymen of\r\nthe Borgia, who \"could nowhere find holes to hide in.\" Even their\r\ncardinals narrowly escaped a general massacre; and on the 8th of\r\nSeptember, a proclamation by the College cleared the city of these\r\nforeigners on pain of the gibbet. Duke Valentino, although prostrated\r\nin strength, and \"seeming as if burnt from the middle downwards,\"\r\nwas not without formidable resources. His hope was, that in the\r\ndistracted state of Rome, the cardinals would provide for their\r\npersonal safety by holding the conclave in St. Angelo, where the\r\nelection would be in his own hands. This calculation was, however,\r\ndefeated by their assembling at the Minerva convent, guarded by the\r\nbarons of Bracciano and Palestrina, with the bravest of the citizens,\r\nand protected by barricades which withstood an assault by the\r\nredoubted Michelotto. Still his troops were staunch, the Vatican and\r\nSt. Angelo were his, and he had secured the treasure of the Holy See.\r\nBut his nerve gave way, and after turning the castle guns against the\r\nOrsini palace on Monte Giordano, he fled in a litter to the French\r\ncamp without the gates, on the 1st of September, and thence made his\r\nway to the stronghold of Nepi. This vacillation brought its fitting\r\nrecompense, and lost him the advantages of his position. Hesitating\r\nbetwixt the Colonna and Orsini factions, wavering between Spanish and\r\nFrench interests, his friends dropped off, his forces melted away,\r\nand he lost the favourable moment for swaying the papal election.\r\n\r\nThe rival parties in the conclave, having had no time to mature their\r\nplans, in consequence of the late Pontiff's sudden decease, trusted\r\nto strengthen their respective interests by delay, and so were\r\nunanimous in choosing, on the 22nd of September, the most feeble of\r\ntheir body, the respected Piccolomini, who survived his exaltation\r\nas Pius III. but twenty-six days. The state of matters at Naples\r\nadded to the general embarrassment. The ceaseless struggles for that\r\ncrown had of late taken a new turn, the contest being now between\r\nLouis of France and Ferdinand of Spain. The Borgia, long adherents\r\nof the former, had recently inclined to the Spanish side; but their\r\ninfluence was now irretrievably gone.\r\n\r\n     *NOTE.--The following is a list of the chief\r\n     conquests of Cesare:--\r\n\r\n     City.

His officers had\r\nconcealed the first news of the tragedy at the Vatican, but, on the\r\n22nd of August, authentic intelligence of the death of Alexander and\r\nthe illness of his son having reached Urbino, through some emissaries\r\nof Guidobaldo who announced that the moment for action had arrived,\r\nthe people ran to arms. The governor fled to Cesena; his lieutenant\r\nwas slain in the tumult; the siege of S. Leo was raised; and in one\r\nday the entire duchy, except one unimportant castle, returned to its\r\nlawful sovereign.[*12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *12: During the Duke's absence an interesting\r\ncorrespondence passed between Isabella d'Este and Cardinal Ippolito\r\nd'Este in Rome concerning a Venus and a Cupid of the Duke's. The\r\nVenus was a torso and antique, but the Cupid was the work of\r\nMichelangelo. Cf. GAYE, _Carteggio d'Artisti_, vol. II.,\r\np. 53; ALVISI, _Cesare Borgia_, p. 537; LUZIO, in _Arch. St. Lombardo_\r\n(1886), and JULIA CARTWRIGHT, _Isabella d'Este_ (Murray, 1903), vol. I.,\r\np. 230 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nOn hearing that the Pope and Cesare were both ill, the Duke of Urbino\r\nhastily quitted Venice, his honourable and secure retreat, leaving\r\nbehind, in the words of Bembo, \"a high reputation for superhuman\r\ngenius, for admirable acquirements, for singular discretion.\" As\r\na parting favour, that republic advanced him 3000 or 4000 ducats,\r\ntowards the expenses of his restoration. He wrote desiring his\r\nnephew Fregoso to send over a detachment from S. Leo, to maintain\r\norder in his capital, and himself following upon the steps of his\r\nmessenger, reached that fortress on the 27th of August. Next day he\r\nproceeded to Urbino, where, Castiglione tells us, \"he was met by\r\nswarms of children bearing olive-boughs, and hailing his auspicious\r\narrival; by aged sires tottering under their years, and weeping for\r\njoy; by men and women; by mothers with their babes; by crowds of\r\nevery age and sex; nay, the very stones seemed to exult and leap.\"\r\nWomen of all ranks flocked in from the adjacent townships, with\r\ntambourines played before them, to see their sovereign, and touch his\r\nhand; whilst popular fury spent itself upon the usurper's armorial\r\nensigns, which had been painted in fresco over the city gates a few\r\nmonths before by Timoteo Vite, at the rate of from one to four ducats\r\neach.[*13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *13: Cf. MADIAI, _Diario delle Cose di Urbino_, in\r\n_Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 444.]\r\n\r\nThe example of Urbino was quickly followed by Sinigaglia, Pesaro,\r\nand the other principalities; and by October, a confederacy for\r\ntheir common maintenance and defence, under oaths and a mutual bond\r\nof 10,000 ducats, was organised by these three states, along with\r\nCamerino, Perugia, Piombino, Città di Castello, and Rimini, in all\r\nwhich the exiled seigneurs had resumed their ascendancy.\r\n\r\nIt was a condition of this league, that no step or engagement should\r\nbe taken by any of the parties without the sanction of Guidobaldo,\r\nwho a month before had strengthened his position by accepting service\r\nfrom the Venetians. The Signory engaged to protect him during life in\r\nhis state, against all attacks, and to pay him annually 20,000 scudi,\r\nhe maintaining for them a hundred men-at-arms, and a hundred and\r\nfifty light cavalry, besides placing at their disposal, for instant\r\nservice, two thousand foot. These were forthwith sent to ravage the\r\nneighbourhood of Cesena, which remained faithful to Valentino, and\r\nthereafter, co-operating with other forces of the new league under\r\nOttaviano Fregoso, they attacked in succession such citadels and\r\ncastles as were held for the usurper.\r\n\r\nThe star of Borgia seemed once more in the ascendant. Early\r\nin October Cesare, now able to bestride a mule, returned to\r\nRome, attended by a hundred and fifty men-at-arms and a hundred\r\nhalberdiers, where he patched up a reconciliation with the Orsini\r\nfaction, then dominant. From motives which it would now be difficult\r\nto trace, the new Pontiff received him with favour, and named\r\nhim captain-general of the Church. But in this crisis of his\r\ndestiny he displayed no elevation of character. Disconcerted by\r\nthe embarrassment of his position, perhaps by the admonitions of\r\nconscience, uncertain where to repose confidence or look for support,\r\nhe quickly repented having trusted himself in the city, and longed\r\nto escape from its incensed populace and exasperated factions to\r\nthe shelter of his strongholds in Romagna. Humbling himself before\r\nGian-Giordano Orsini, the enemy of his race, he obtained a promise of\r\nhis escort across the Campagna; but perceiving, ere he had cleared\r\nthe gate, that he was in the hands of men by whom old grudges were\r\nnot forgotten, he fled in panic to the Vatican. There he crouched\r\nbeneath the doubtful favour of Pius, and the waning influence of the\r\nSpanish cardinals, who vainly sought to protect his property from\r\npillage, and to expedite his escape in disguise, until the Holy See\r\nwas again vacated by its short-lived occupant.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: In the communal archives of Perugia, there is a brief\r\naddressed to the authorities of that town by Pius III., dated 17th of\r\nOctober, 1503, \"before his coronation,\" but in fact the day preceding\r\nhis death, which must have been obtained by the influence of Cesare,\r\nand which speaks a language very different from what his Holiness\r\nwould probably have adopted had his life been spared. Its object\r\nwas to prohibit certain \"conventicles\" which Gianpaolo Baglioni\r\nwas reported to be holding in Perugia, for the purpose of plotting\r\nagainst the person of the Duke of Valenza and Romagna, and to desire\r\nthat he be charged to avoid all courses tending to the prejudice of\r\nBorgia.]\r\n\r\nThus was that make-shift policy defeated by which the late conclave\r\nhad sought time for strengthening their interests and maturing their\r\nintrigues: a new election was at hand ere its elements had subsided\r\nfrom their recent turmoil. The Orsini were paramount in the city,\r\nthe Spaniards in the Sacred College. A struggle ensued whether the\r\nformer should obtain an order for Valentino's departure, or should\r\nthemselves withdraw from Rome before the conclave was closed. Victory\r\ndeclared for the Iberian cardinals, by aid of Ascanio Sforza, who\r\nsought to conciliate their suffrages for himself. Once again the\r\nbantling of fortune had the game in his hand, again to play it\r\naway. Holding, as was supposed, at his absolute disposal the votes\r\nof the Borgian cardinals, he was courted by all who aspired to the\r\ntiara; and in hopes of retrieving his affairs by the election of a\r\nfriendly pope, he took measures for throwing his whole influence\r\ninto the scale of Amboise, Cardinal of Rouen, as organ of the French\r\nparty. But that strong will and indomitable resolution which had\r\ntriumphantly carried him through many crimes were now wanting. From\r\nday to day his plans faltered and his policy wavered; finally his\r\nefforts failed. Men were wearied of the feeble counsels, the selfish\r\nepicureanism, the public scandals of recent pontiffs. To rescue\r\nthe Church from utter degradation, a very different category of\r\nqualifications was required, and even the electors felt that they\r\nmust find a pope in all respects the reverse of Alexander.\r\n\r\nThere was no member of the Sacred College whom Valentino had such\r\nreason to fear and hate, none of whose domineering ambition the\r\nConsistory stood in such awe, as Giulio della Rovere. Yet did his\r\nmaster-spirit overcome all opposition. On the day preceding the\r\nconclave he effected a reconciliation with the Spaniards, and his\r\nancient rival Ascanio Sforza sought his friendship. As he rode to\r\nenter upon its duties, the cortège of attendant prelates equalled\r\nthat which usually swelled the train of an elected pope. Before\r\nthe door was closed, bets of eighty-two to a hundred were made on\r\nhis success, one hundred to six being offered against any other\r\ncandidate. It was, therefore, scarcely matter of surprise that within\r\nan hour or two thereafter Julius II. was chosen by acclamation,\r\nwithout a scrutiny.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Our information is in many respects deficient regarding\r\nthe numerous and complicated events occurring at Rome between the\r\npoisoning of Alexander and the final departure of his son Cesare,\r\nand authorities are frequently irreconcileable. We are indebted to\r\nSanuto's Diary for many unedited particulars, especially of the papal\r\nelections, but the most distinct account of these transactions, and\r\non the whole trustworthy, which we have met with, is given by Masse.]\r\n\r\nAt the last moment, Borgia's adherents, finding opposition vain,\r\nthought it best to lay the new occupant of St. Peter's chair under\r\nthe obligation of their suffrages, a policy which Machiavelli had\r\njustly condemned as the greatest blunder ever committed by their\r\nleader. Some historians allege that their support was gained by an\r\noffer of Julius to maintain him in his dignities and investitures,\r\nbetrothing his infant daughter to his own nephew the young Lord\r\nPrefect. Unlikely as this may seem, there is much apparent\r\ninconsistency in the Pontiff's treatment of him, which, if our\r\nauthorities are to be trusted, showed nothing of that choleric\r\ntemperament and energetic firmness which habitually characterised\r\nhim. Within two days of his election, when speaking of Valentino\r\nto the Venetian envoy, he said, \"We shall let him get off with all\r\nhe has robbed from the Church in his evil hour, but would that\r\nthe towns of Romagna were taken from him.\" Yet a change appears\r\nto have supervened, induced perhaps by Cesare's representations,\r\nwhich had formerly been successful with Pius III., that, under his\r\nsway, the influence of the Church in that province of her patrimony\r\nwould be far better maintained than by handing it again to the old\r\ndynasties, whom he had with difficulty eradicated, and who had ever\r\nbeen turbulent vassals of the Apostolic Chamber. The now manifest\r\nintention of the Venetians to obtain a footing in that quarter, upon\r\nvarious pretexts founded on claims of the Manfredi and others of the\r\ndispossessed lords, gave cogency to this reasoning in the eyes of\r\nJulius, whose paramount policy of at all hazards aggrandising the\r\nkeys, rendered Valentino's sovereignty preferable to such extension\r\nof their dominion, and may have somewhat extenuated the Borgian\r\npolicy in his eyes. He therefore brought the usurper from St. Angelo\r\nto lodge in the Vatican, and entered with seeming cordiality into\r\nhis views. But the lapse of a few days found his Holiness in another\r\nmood, declaring that his guest should not hold a single battlement\r\nthroughout Italy, but might be thankful if spared his life and the\r\ntreasures he had plundered, most of which were however already\r\ndissipated. From that moment the prestige of his position was at an\r\nend, and he remained at the palace \"in small repute.\"\r\n\r\nThe crisis soon became urgent, for the Venetian troops were pouring\r\nupon Romagna, whilst the few fortresses that still owned Borgia as\r\ntheir master were gradually falling to the confederate chiefs, led\r\nby Guidobaldo. On the 9th of November, letters, demanding these\r\ncaptured castles in the name of the Signory, found the latter ill\r\nof gout; but in reply he expressed surprise at the summons, seeing\r\nthat he had wrested them from the usurper, and hoped to hold them\r\nfor the pope elect, and in security for the valuables of which he\r\nhad been pillaged. In consideration, perhaps, of his being then\r\nactually in pay of the Republic, he agreed to deliver up Verucchio\r\nand Cesenatico, whereupon the messenger reported him to the Doge as\r\n\"a good Christian, but in want of some one to counsel him.\"\r\n\r\nIn this exigency, Cesare proposed to surrender to the Pope the\r\ncitadels of Cesena, Bertinoro, Forlì, and Forlimpopoli, as a means\r\nof immediately arresting the progress of their assailants, and of\r\ncutting short the schemes of Venice, offering to serve the Church\r\nduring the rest of his life in any capacity that was thought\r\nexpedient. This offer Julius declined, but gave him liberty to\r\nrepair to the scene of action, and act for the best with what\r\ntroops he could raise. He accordingly went to Ostia on the 19th\r\nof November, meaning to take shipping for Upper Italy; but on the\r\n21st the Pontiff, alarmed at the progress of the Venetians, and\r\ninfluenced by Guidobaldo, who, arriving on that day, had demanded\r\njustice upon Borgia, thought better of it, and sent to get from\r\nhim the countersigns of his citadels. These Valentino refusing,\r\nhe was brought back to Rome under arrest on the 29th, and, after\r\nmuch temporising, ultimately gave the necessary passwords for the\r\nsurrender of his last hold upon his recent dominions.\r\n\r\nSuch seem the admitted facts of the Pope's treatment of Borgia.\r\nHis change of conduct may have been dictated by new circumstances\r\ncoming to his knowledge, or it may have been part of a systematic\r\ndeception, in order to turn Valentino's influence to his own\r\npurposes. The opinions of Giovio and De Thou show that such treachery\r\nas Guicciardini charges upon Julius, and as Cesare met soon after\r\nfrom Gonsalvo di Cordova, was regarded by the lax public and private\r\nmorality of the age as justified by his own infamous perfidies. On\r\nthe other hand, it is admitted that the Cardinal della Rovere's high\r\nreputation for good faith was one of his recommendations to the\r\nconclave. Bossi, in an additional note to vol. IV. of his translation\r\nof _Leo X._, considers this dark passage of history to be cleared up\r\nby the narrative of Baldi, regarding Guidobaldo's generous treatment\r\nof the enemy of his house, to which he attributes the moderation of\r\nhis Holiness; but this view does not seem borne out either by dates\r\nor by Baldi's words.[*16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *16: Cf. the latter, in which an account of the interview\r\nbetween Cesare and Guidobaldo is given, UGOLINI, _op. cit._, vol. II.,\r\np. 523. It does not bear out Giustiniani's account (q.v. ii., 326) of\r\nwhat Guidobaldo said to him, and is probably mere rhetoric.]\r\n\r\nThus terminated Duke Valentino's connection with the immediate\r\nsubject of this narrative. A few words will suffice to trace the\r\nremainder of his fluctuating fortunes. Having been again transmitted\r\nto Ostia, he remained there a sort of prisoner at large until\r\nApril, 1504, when his escape to Naples was connived at. There he\r\nwas received with distinction by Gonsalvo di Cordova, viceroy of\r\nFerdinand II.; but soon after, an order arrived from that king to\r\nsend him prisoner to Spain. With this command, suggested probably by\r\na brief from Julius, which Raynaldus has printed, the Great Captain\r\nat once complied, although Borgia held his safe-conduct,--a breach of\r\nfaith which the Spanish historians justify by the alleged detection\r\nof schemes and intrigues, originated by Cesare and perilous to the\r\nascendancy of his Catholic Majesty. Yet we learn that the Viceroy's\r\nlast hour seemed troubled by repentance for this stain upon his\r\nconscience, which even in his day of pride one chivalrous spirit had\r\ndared thus to question. Baldassare Scipio of Siena, a free captain\r\nlong in Cesare's service, publicly placarded a challenge to any\r\nSpaniard who should venture to maintain \"that the Duke Valentino had\r\nnot been arrested at Naples, in direct violation of a safe-conduct\r\ngranted in the names of Ferdinand and Isabella, to the great infamy\r\nand infinite faithlessness of all their crowns.\" On reaching the land\r\nof his fathers, this incarnate spirit of a blood-stained age was\r\nconfined in the castle of Medina del Campo, and the interest used for\r\nhis release by the Spanish cardinals, and by his brothers-in-law the\r\nKing of Navarre and the Duke of Ferrara, who offered their guarantee\r\nfor his good behaviour, was, during three years, unavailing on the\r\nground of his dangerous character. At length he made his escape by\r\na rope-ladder or cord, under circumstances so fool-hardy as to be\r\nascribed by the country people to supernatural aid, and reached the\r\nKing of Navarre, who gave him the command of an expedition against\r\nthe Count de Lérin. On the 10th of March, 1507, he fell into an\r\nambuscade near Viane, and was cut to pieces fighting desperately. By\r\na singular coincidence, his stripped and plundered body, having been\r\nrecognised by a servant, was interred in the church of Pampeluna, the\r\narchbishopric of which had been his earliest promotion. Short as was\r\nhis life (for he seems to have died under thirty) he had survived all\r\nhis dignities and distinctions, realising the distich of Sannazaro,\r\n\r\n     \"CÆSAR, he aimed at all, he vanquished all;\r\n       In all he fails, a CYPHER in his fall.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17:\r\n\r\n     \"Omnia vincebas, sperabas omnia Cæsar;\r\n       Omnia deficiunt, incipis esse nihil.\"]\r\n\r\nValentino's was a character peculiar to Spain, with which Pizarro\r\nalone seems to have matched. His boundless ambition was profoundly\r\nselfish and utterly unscrupulous; his energy of purpose owned no\r\nimpulse but egotism; his capacity was marred by meanness; his\r\nsplendid tastes served but as incentives to spoliation. The demands\r\nof honour, the compunctions of conscience, the value of human\r\nlife availed nothing in his eyes. In him foresight became fraud,\r\ncalculation cunning, prudence perfidy, courage cruelty. His daring,\r\nhis constancy, his talent were devoted to murder, rapine, and\r\ntreachery. His campaigns were massacres, his justice vengeance, his\r\ndiplomacy a trick. Generosity was a stranger to his impulses, remorse\r\nto his crimes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortune, so long adverse to Guidobaldo, at length smiled upon him.\r\nThe election to the tiara of his relative and confidential friend,\r\nCardinal della Rovere, freed him from anxiety as to the restoration\r\nof his duchy, and promised him a long career of prosperity and\r\nhonour. His policy of supporting the Venetians in their views upon\r\nRomagna thus not only became superfluous as a check upon Borgia,\r\nbut seemed not unlikely to place him in a dilemma with the Camera.\r\nThe new Pontiff, therefore, lost no time in removing him from a\r\nposition of such delicacy, by summoning him to Rome. The invitation\r\nfound him encamped before Verucchio, whence he immediately set out;\r\nand, after devoting two days at Urbino to public thanksgivings and\r\nfestivities for his own restoration and for the election of Julius,\r\nhe performed the journey in a litter, his gout preventing him from\r\nriding. On the eleventh day, being the 20th of November, he was met\r\nat the Ponte Molle by a superbly caparisoned mule, and on it was\r\npainfully but honourably escorted by an imposing cortège to his\r\napartment in the Vatican, under a salute from the artillery of St.\r\nAngelo. Notwithstanding his fatigue, he was bidden by the impatient\r\nPontiff to supper that evening, and was received by his Holiness on\r\nthe landing-place with equal favour and distinction.\r\n\r\nIn the explanations which followed, their mutual views were frankly\r\nstated. The claim which the Venetians had upon Guidobaldo, from\r\nextending to him their hospitality and support in almost desperate\r\ncircumstances, was fully allowed by the Pope, and his avowal that, in\r\nco-operating with them in an invasion of Romagna, he conceived they\r\nwere thwarting Borgia, not the Church, was accepted as satisfactory.\r\nBut his Holiness intimated, with reference to the future, that the\r\nvassal of the Apostolic See had duties paramount to all foreign ties;\r\nand that, since the rights of the Camera over that province admitted\r\nof no compromise, he would do well to resign the service of the\r\nRepublic, and recall his consort to administer his affairs at home,\r\nwhilst he remained in Rome for the winter. To these suggestions the\r\nDuke agreed, and wrote in most grateful terms to the government of\r\nVenice, explaining the obstacles which had unexpectedly arisen to his\r\nrepaying at that moment the obligations he had incurred. We learn\r\nfrom Sanuto that on the 10th of October the Duchess with her ladies\r\nwent into college, and being seated near the Doge, thanked the\r\nSignory in her lord's name for the favour, command, and protection\r\ngranted to him, to which the Doge replied blandly, asserting the love\r\nborne him by the Republic. Again, on the 15th of November, there came\r\ninto the cabinet of the Signory \"the Duchess of Urbino with Madonna\r\nEmilia and her company of damsels to take leave, for she is departing\r\nearly to-morrow morning for her duchy; she goes in a barge by the Po\r\nas far as Ravenna, and from thence on horseback: and the Doge spake\r\nher fair, and having taken leave, we sages of the orders accompanied\r\nher as far as the palace-gates, and she proceeded along the Mercery,\r\nreaching home on the 2d of December.\"\r\n\r\nBorgia took the opportunity of Guidobaldo's visit to make advances\r\nfor a reconciliation, having reason to dread his influence with\r\nthe Pope. These were received with courtesy; but, in the words of\r\nthe Venetian chronicler just quoted, \"the Duke was resolved to\r\nhave his own again, especially the library, which was promised\r\nhim without damage, with the tapestries, although the Cardinal of\r\nRouen had already got a good share of them.\" According to Baldi's\r\nelaborate and somewhat too dramatic description of their interview,\r\nhe magnanimously forgave the extraordinary injuries he had received\r\nfrom his now humbled adversary. On the authority of private letters,\r\nan anonymous diary, already noticed, states that the usurper threw\r\nhimself, cap-in-hand, at the Duke's feet, beseeching mercy and\r\npardon, and excusing his conduct on the plea of youth, the brutality\r\nof his father, and the persuasions of others. This incident was\r\nrepresented in a fresco by Taddeo Zucchero, which I saw at Cagli in\r\n1843, and which had been cut from the villa built at S. Angelo in\r\nVado, by Duke Guidobaldo II. Cesare is a slight figure handsomely\r\ndressed, with long sharp features, a high nose and reddish hair. He\r\nkneels before the Duke of Urbino, raising his cap, whilst one notary\r\nappears to read aloud an act of surrender, and another makes an\r\ninstrument upon the transaction.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Considering that Borgia was probably dead half a\r\ncentury before this painting was commissioned, little reliance can be\r\nplaced upon the likeness. *This is the account alluded to in note *1,\r\npage 29.]\r\n\r\nEven after Valentino had given authority for a surrender of the\r\ncitadels in Romagna, they were held by his officers upon the plea\r\nthat he was not a free agent, and the bearer of his missive was\r\nhanged by the castellan of Cesena. At length the Pope ordered\r\nGuidobaldo to reduce them by force. For this purpose he named\r\nhim gonfaloniere of the Church, retaining him and four hundred\r\nmen-at-arms, with a year's pay of 7000 ducats in advance. It was\r\nabout this time that he was invested with the insignia of the Garter,\r\nto which illustrious order he had been elected in February. His\r\nacquisition of this dignity, and Count Baldassare Castiglione's\r\nmission to London as proxy at his installation, form an episode of\r\nso much interest to an English reader that we have gleaned every\r\npossible notice of these events, and have arranged them in II. of the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nThe Duke left Rome for his command, accompanied by his nephew the\r\nPrefettino, as he was then usually called from his youth, who had\r\nreturned from France three months before to wait upon his Holiness.\r\nThey were attended by Castiglione, who, after charming Julius by\r\nhis polished society, was permitted by him to transfer his services\r\nto the court of Guidobaldo, of which he became the ornament and\r\ncommentator. On the 1st of June they reached Urbino, and found the\r\nDuchess re-established among an attached people, who, to drive away\r\nsad recollections of their recent sufferings, had amused her during\r\nthe preceding carnival with scenic imitations of the principal events\r\nof the usurpation! One of these was the comedy (so called rather\r\nin a Dantesque than a comic sense) of the Duke Valentino and Pope\r\nAlexander VI. In it were successively represented their plotting the\r\nseizure of the state, their sending the Lady Lucrezia to Ferrara,\r\ntheir inviting the Duchess to her wedding, the invasion of the duchy,\r\nthe duke's first return, and his redeparture, the massacre of the\r\nconfederates, the death of the Pope, and the Duke's restoration to\r\nhis rights.\r\n\r\nThe garrisons of Cesena and Bertinoro had surrendered ere Guidobaldo\r\ntook the field, that of Forlì came to terms as soon as his troops\r\nappeared. With it passed the last wreck of the Borgian substantial\r\npower and vast ambition, within a year from the death of Alexander,\r\nleaving to future times no memorial but a name doomed to lasting\r\nexecration. Guidobaldo had at the same time the satisfaction of\r\nrecovering most of the valuables that had been pillaged from his\r\npalace, estimated by him at not less than 100,000 ducats, especially\r\na large proportion of his father's celebrated library.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of September the Duke retraced his steps to Urbino, and\r\nthere at length renewed the long-suspended joys of his secure and\r\ntranquil residence. Few, perhaps, of their rank and age, less needed\r\nsuch rough discipline to inculcate moderation, than this exemplary\r\ncouple. Yet must the lessons of adversity have been ordained for some\r\npurifying purpose, and we may indulge the hope that they were not\r\nsent in vain. The Duke devoted his earliest leisure to signalise his\r\ngratitude for the unflinching loyalty of his subjects by conferring\r\nupon their several municipalities various privileges and immunities,\r\nand remitting their fiscal arrears. The Duchess expressed her\r\nthankfulness by many works of piety, by liberal charities, and by\r\ninstituting a three days' fair on the anniversary of her lord's\r\nrestoration. Their domestic circle was agreeably enlarged by the\r\narrival of the Lady Prefectess, as the widow of Giovanni delle Rovere\r\nwas entitled, who, on returning from a similar exile, and after\r\npaying her reverence to her brother-in-law the Pope, hastened to join\r\nher son at her brother's court. We have noticed the services which\r\nwhen assailed by Valentino, she received from Andrea Doria; they\r\nwere now acknowledged by Guidobaldo with the castle of Sassocorbaro,\r\nand other holdings. Another guest at Urbino was Sigismondo Varana,\r\nthe young heir of Camerino, who arrived with his mother Maria, sister\r\nof the Prefettino, and with his uncle and guardian Giovanni Maria,\r\nwho afterwards supplanted him in that state.\r\n\r\nUrbino was now enlivened by an event which proved of paramount\r\ninterest to its sovereign, and was destined by providence to carry\r\nforward its independence and glories under a new dynasty. We have\r\nseen how it had been proposed between the Cardinal della Rovere and\r\nGuidobaldo, in 1498, that the latter should adopt the young Prefect\r\nas his heir, and procure from the Pope a renewal of the Dukedom and\r\ninvestitures to his favour.[19] The simulated sanction of Alexander\r\nto this arrangement led to no result; but, as soon as Julius was\r\nfixed in the seat of St. Peter, he took measures for placing his\r\nnephew's prospects beyond question. In the natural course of events\r\nthe state of Urbino would lapse to the Holy See on the Duke's death,\r\nand, as the uniform policy of this Pontiff was to unite to it as many\r\nsuch fiefs as the failure of their seigneurs or the force of his\r\narms brought within his grasp, his making an exception of the most\r\nvaluable of them all in favour of his own nephew gave rise to not a\r\nfew strictures. It is, however, the only instance in which nepotism\r\ncan be laid to his charge, and the precedents left him by recent\r\nPopes may be pleaded in justification of a comparatively trifling\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See vol. I., p. 371.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September the Archbishop of Ragusa arrived at\r\nUrbino as papal nuncio, charged with brieves for the completion\r\nof this affair, and also with the ensigns of command for the Duke\r\nas generalissimo of the ecclesiastical troops. The ceremonials\r\nconsequent upon the implement of his mission have been detailed by\r\nBaldi, and are characteristic of the times we are endeavouring\r\nto depict. The nuncio and his splendid suite were received with\r\ndistinction, and next day, being Sunday, was fixed for Guidobaldo's\r\ninstallation. The whole court and principal inhabitants being\r\nassembled in the cathedral, high mass was performed by him, after\r\nwhich, standing in front of the altar, he laid aside his mitre, and\r\npronounced a solemn benediction on the two standards of the Church,\r\nwhich were held furled by a canon, whilst he waved incense over them,\r\nand sprinkled them with holy water. This ended, he desired them to\r\nbe mounted on their staves, and having sat down and resumed his\r\nmitre, he presented them to the Duke, who received them, devoutly\r\nkneeling on the altar-steps, and handed one to Ottaviano Fregoso, the\r\nother to Morello d'Ortona. He then received the baton, with the like\r\nceremonies, and rose, after kissing hands; whereupon the audience\r\ndispersed amid strains of martial music and popular acclamations.\r\n\r\nUpon the 18th, there assembled in the Duomo a still more numerous\r\nand distinguished auditory; when, after celebration of mass by the\r\nnuncio, he seated himself before the altar, with the Prefect on his\r\nright, and the Duke on his left, and in an elegant Latin discourse,\r\nset forth the desire of the latter to make sure the succession by\r\nadopting his nephew, and the approval of the Pope and college of\r\ncardinals to that substitution, in evidence of which the brieves and\r\nother formal documents were read. A magnificent missal,--perhaps\r\nthat painted for Matthew Corvinus King of Hungary, which adorns the\r\nVatican Urbino Library,--was then placed in the hands of Francesco\r\nMaria, opened at a miniature of the holy sacrament, and upon it\r\ndeputies from the communities of the duchy took the oath of fidelity\r\nand homage to him as their future sovereign; all which having been\r\nregularly attested in notorial instruments, the solemnity ended.[*20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *20: Cf. MADIAI, _op. cit._, in _Arch. cit._, vol.\r\n_cit._, p. 451-2.]\r\n\r\nThese events served to aggravate the jealousy of the Venetians\r\nagainst the claims of Julius upon their recent acquisitions of\r\nRomagna, which they regarded as fairly conquered from Borgia. They\r\npossessed in this way the states of Ravenna, Faenza, and Rimini, and\r\nhad gained footing upon the territories of Imola, Forlì, and Cesena,\r\nthe inhabitants of which loudly complained of their aggressions.\r\nOf all these places the Church was the acknowledged superior, and\r\nthe old investitures held under her by their respective princely\r\nfamilies had been annulled by Alexander, in order to make way for\r\nhis son. Some of these dynasties had died out, and Julius showed\r\nno disposition to restore the others, his leading object being the\r\ntemporal aggrandisement of the papacy. At this juncture his Holiness\r\nsent for Guidobaldo, to consult with him; and in order to facilitate\r\nhis arrival, presented him with a commodious litter swung between\r\ntwo beautifully dappled horses. The winter journey was, however,\r\ndisastrous to his dilapidated frame, and he was laid up for nine\r\ndays at Narni with gout, complicated by fever and dysentery, and\r\nconsequently did not reach Rome with his nephew and Castiglione\r\nuntil the 2nd of January, when they slept outside of the gate, and\r\nnext morning made a solemn entrance. It was the great object of the\r\nRepublic to be received as vicar or vassal of the Holy See in the\r\nthree first-mentioned states, and for this end they were willing to\r\nabandon all claims and attempts upon the remaining three. Guidobaldo,\r\ninterposing as a mediator to prevent an open breach between parties\r\nso mutually deserving of his friendship, persuaded the Signory to\r\nabandon the latter places, and trust to the justice of Julius for the\r\nfulfilment of their desires. To procure this, they sent, in April,\r\na splendid embassy to Rome of eight commissioners, with two hundred\r\nattendants, headed by Bembo, who, passing by Urbino, received from\r\nthe Duchess a princely welcome. But no benefit accrued from this\r\nmeasure, for the Pontiff's ultimatum was announced to the senate\r\nthrough Louis XII., giving them Rimini and Faenza, during his life\r\nonly, a result highly unsatisfactory to the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's prolonged residence in Rome, where his company became\r\ngreatly prized by the Pope, was little relished by his consort or his\r\npeople; so, to maintain them in good humour, his Holiness announced\r\na plenary indulgence for all their broken vows and deeds of violence\r\nduring the late usurpation, to such as should devoutly observe the\r\nEaster ceremonies. The alms collected at this jubilee, amounting to\r\n2265 florins, were expended upon the duomo of Urbino. At length, in\r\nthe end of July, 1506, he obtained leave to return home, on the plea\r\nthat change of air was advisable for his health.[*21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *21: Cf. MADIAI, _op. cit._, in _Arch. cit._, vol.\r\n_cit._, p. 455. This Diary says that the Duke returned at the end of\r\nFebruary, 1506.]\r\n\r\nJulius, having announced to the consistory his intention of extending\r\nthe temporal sovereignty of the Church over such portions of the\r\necclesiastical territory as were possessed by tyrants (for so he\r\ncalled the vicars and other lords who ruled their petty states as\r\nfeudatories of the Holy See), carried his design into effect with\r\ncharacteristic energy. He set out for Perugia on the 26th of August,\r\nafter having directed the Duke of Urbino and his nephew to march\r\nthither, each with two hundred men-at-arms, and expel its seigneur\r\nGianpaolo Baglioni. Here Guidobaldo again appeared as mediator, and,\r\npersuaded by him to submit with good grace to a fate that he could\r\nnot avert, the Lord of Perugia gave up his fortresses, and was taken\r\ninto the pay of Julius for his expedition against Bologna. The Pope,\r\nelated by the ease with which so formidable an opponent had been\r\ndisposed of, pressed on preparations for attacking the Bentivoglii.\r\nHe reached Urbino on the 25th of September, accompanied by twenty-two\r\ncardinals, with a suitable cortège, and a guard of four hundred men.\r\nBeyond the walls he was received by forty-five noble youths, dressed\r\nin doublets and hose of white silk, who, on his alighting, seized as\r\ntheir perquisite his richly caparisoned mule, which was afterwards\r\nredeemed from them for sixty golden ducats. The gates were thrown\r\ndown to receive him, and he was there met by the Duke, disabled from\r\ndismounting; by the magistracy, who presented the keys; and by the\r\ncourt and clergy. A rich canopy shaded him, as the holy sacrament\r\nwas borne before him to the cathedral; and after devotion there, he\r\nentered the palace, which next evening was illuminated, along with\r\nthe citadel, fireworks being displayed in the piazza. Some singular\r\nusages of hospitality were adopted on this occasion. The Duke\r\npresented to his Holiness a hundred sacks of flour, as much barley\r\nand corn, with a proportionate quantity of live stock and poultry,\r\nto the value in all of 800 ducats.[*22] This donative was accepted,\r\nand part of it was handed over to the hospital of the Misericordia.\r\nIn anticipation of the Pope's advent, the roads were repaired and\r\nsmoothed, triumphal arches and statues were erected, flowers and\r\nevergreens were strewn before him, the streets were adorned with gay\r\nhangings and shaded by linen awnings, the palace was arrayed in those\r\nrich tapestries, pictures, and furniture, which the taste of Federigo\r\nand his son had accumulated. Next evening, the palace roofs and the\r\ncitadel were illuminated, and over the latter was hung a brilliant\r\ncross of fire. Deputations arrived from Pesaro, and the principal\r\nplaces in the duchy, with gifts of provisions; but large supplies had\r\nbeen previously laid in by the Duke for so vast an influx; and in\r\norder to regulate prices, the following tariff, calculated at about\r\nhalf the current value, was proclaimed.\r\n\r\n  Wheat, per staio or bush    45  bolognini.\r\n  Barley      \"      \"        36      \"\r\n  Oats        \"      \"        24      \"\r\n  Wine, per somma             54      \"\r\n  Ditto, new  \"               27      \"\r\n  Mutton, per lb.              1      \"\r\n  Veal, per lb.               10      \"\r\n  Ox flesh   \"                 8      \"\r\n  Salt meat  \"            1 to 7      \"\r\n  Capons, per pair             9      \"\r\n  Fowls      \"            4 to 7      \"\r\n  Pigeons    \"            4 to 7      \"\r\n  Wood pigeons, per pair  1 to 7      \"\r\n  Eggs, seven for              1      \"\r\n  Cheese, per lb.         1 to 7      \"\r\n  Hay, per cwt.           4 to 7      \"\r\n  Wood, per somma            1/2  carlino.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *22: Cf.

Leo.\r\nThence he summoned the Bentivoglii to surrender their city to him as\r\nits lawful sovereign, and ordered the people on pain of interdict\r\nto abandon their cause, and open the gates. These chiefs had made\r\ngreat preparations for defence, but subsequently, on finding\r\nthemselves deserted by Louis XII., offered terms, to which Julius,\r\nelated at the prospect of French succours, would not listen. The\r\nwar, which promised to be obstinate, passed off in a revolution; for\r\nthe Bentivoglii, losing heart, made their escape, to the delight\r\nof the citizens, who, thus saved from a siege, threw open their\r\ngates, and hailed the Pope as their liberator. He made his entry\r\non Martinmas-day, and at once confirmed this favourable impression\r\nby abolishing various grievances, and by scattering in the streets\r\n4000 golden scudi bearing the legend \"Bologna freed from its tyrant\r\nby Julius.\"[24] The mob showed their zeal by demolishing the\r\npalace of their late rulers, one of the most beautiful in Italy,\r\nwherein miserably perished many treasures of art; and its ill-fated\r\nmaster and mistress soon after died of broken hearts in Lombardy.\r\nBut fortune is fickle, and the breath of popular favour still more\r\nchangeful. Four years and a half from this date the war-cry of\r\n\"Bentivoglio\" again rang through these streets; the same mob strained\r\ntheir brawny sinews to level the citadel which Julius had erected\r\nto curb them, and to shatter the colossal statue of him with which\r\nMichael Angelo had adorned their piazza; the same Pontiff saved\r\nhimself from capture, and his legate escaped from the popular fury\r\nto fall by the dagger of a friend. Such are the retributions of\r\nHIM \"whose ways are unsearchable, and whose thoughts are\r\npast finding out.\"[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: In the same feeling, though of later date, a copy of\r\nRaffaele's speaking portrait of his Holiness, now in the Torlonia\r\nGallery, and attributed to Giulio Romano, is inscribed, \"The author\r\nof freedom, for the citizens he saved.\" This conquest became a\r\ntriumph of art as well as of arms; the colossal statue of Julius,\r\nbegun by Michael Angelo in Nov. 1506, was erected in February, 1508.\r\nIt weighed 17,500 lb. of bronze, and cost about 12,000 golden ducats,\r\nof which 1000 went to the artist.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See ch. xxxiii. of this work.]\r\n\r\nThe Pope remained until late in February to settle his new conquest,\r\nkeeping the Duke near him as a friend and counsellor, and on the\r\n3rd of March, in defiance of the inclement season, repeated his\r\nvisit to Urbino for one day, with a smaller company, while on his\r\nreturn to Rome. His host, after conveying him as far as Cagli on the\r\n5th, pleaded his constitutional malady, and returned home with the\r\nPrefect. As this was the period selected by Count Castiglione for\r\nportraying the ducal court, it will be well to pause for a little,\r\nand consider the representation he has left us of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n     The Court of Urbino, its manners and its stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe taste for philosophy, letters, and arts, and the patronage of\r\ntheir professors which Cosimo de' Medici and his son Lorenzo the\r\nMagnificent had introduced among the merchant-rulers of Florence,\r\nwere, as we have already seen, adopted by several petty sovereigns of\r\nthe Peninsula, but chiefly by those in the district of Romagna.[26]\r\nSigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta was the first to engraft these fruits\r\nof peace upon a military despotism, which his restless ambition and\r\nfierce temper ever rendered the torment of his neighbours, and the\r\nscourge of his people. The d'Este of Ferrara, the Sforza of Pesaro,\r\nbut, above all, Duke Federigo of Urbino, improving upon his example,\r\nhad shown how mental cultivation might be brought to modify, or, as\r\nthe Latin idiom has it, to humanise, without enervating, a martial\r\ncharacter. The reign of Guidobaldo was peculiarly favourable to\r\nthe development of this new and attractive principle; for though\r\nenabled partially to sustain the fame in arms which his father had\r\nbequeathed him, his feeble health gave him greater opportunity for\r\nthe cultivation of letters, and for the society of the learned,\r\nto which he was naturally partial. Seconded by the sympathies of\r\nhis estimable Duchess, his palace became a resort of the first\r\nliterary and political celebrities of the day, who during the few\r\nyears that succeeded his restoration, diffused over it a tone of\r\nrefinement elsewhere unrivalled. To fix for the contemplation of\r\nposterity those graceful but transient images which flitted across\r\nthis gay and brilliant society was the pleasing task undertaken by\r\nCastiglione,[*27] one of its most polished ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See above, ch. viii., ix., x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *27: The following is a short bibliography of _Il\r\nCortegiano_, and of works relating to it:--\r\n\r\nSALVADORI, _Il Cortegiano_ (Firenze, 1884).\r\n\r\nCIAN, _Il Cortegiano_ (Firenze, 1894).\r\n\r\nOPDYCKE, _The Book of the Courtier_ (New York, 1901).\r\n\r\nBOTTARI, _Studio su B.C. e il suo Libro_ (Pisa, 1874).\r\n\r\nLUZIO E RENIER, _Mantova e Urbino_ (Torino, 1893).\r\n\r\nCIAN, in _Giornale Stor. d.

And as the fragrant influence\r\ncontinued fresh upon my mind of the deceased Duke's virtues, and of\r\nthe pleasure I had for some years enjoyed in the amiable society of\r\nthe excellent persons who then frequented his court, I was induced\r\nfrom these reflections to write a treatise of THE COURTIER.\r\nThis I accomplished in a few days, with the intention of subsequently\r\ncorrecting the errors incidental to so hasty a composition.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *28: In the _Lettera Dedicatoria_.

Ed. Cian, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot here follow the Count into the wide field which he thus\r\nindicates, nor is it necessary, since his own work is accessible in\r\nseveral languages. But from various passages we may offer a sketch of\r\nthe manners approved at the pattern court of Urbino, which will not\r\nbe deemed misplaced in these pages. The men who figured there were\r\nchiefly distinguished in arms or letters. Whilst the former spent\r\ntheir leisure in recollections of war and love, or in the congenial\r\npastimes of the field and the chase, the conversation of the\r\nlatter was often warped towards scholastic disputation, or tainted\r\nby classic pedantry. Such manners have often been described, and\r\ntheir interest has long passed away; but in a society where female\r\ninfluence prevailed, and in an age when female intellect was fruitful\r\nin prodigies, it may be well to see what were the graces expected\r\nfrom a palace-dame.[*31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *31: Concerning Elisabetta Gonzaga. Cf. LUZIO E\r\nRENIER, _Mantova e Urbino, Isabella d'Este, ed Elisabetta\r\nGonzaga_ (Torino, 1893).]\r\n\r\nAt the head of a string of common-place endowments we find a noble\r\nbearing, an avoidance of affectation, a natural grace in every\r\naction. Beauty is considered as most desirable, not indispensable;\r\nand its improvement by such artificial means as painting and\r\nenamelling the face, extirpating hairs on the eyebrows or forehead,\r\nis derided. White teeth and hands are fully appreciated, but\r\ntheir frequent display is censured. A neat _chaussure_ is lauded,\r\nespecially when veiled by long draperies. In short, natural elegance\r\nand the absence of artifice are primary qualifications. A high-born\r\nlady must be circumspect even beyond suspicion, avoiding ill-timed\r\nfamiliarity, and all freedom of language verging upon licence; but\r\nwhen casually exposed to discussions tending to pruriency, a modest\r\nblush would be becoming, whilst shrinking or prudery might expose her\r\nto sneers. Willingly to listen to or repeat slander of her own sex\r\nis a fatal error, which will always be harshly construed by men. Her\r\naccomplishments and amusements should ever be selected with feminine\r\ndelicacy, verging upon timidity; her dress chosen in tasteful\r\nreference to what is most becoming, but with apparent absence of\r\nstudy. In conversing with men she should be frank, affable, and\r\nlively; but modest, staid, and self-possessed, with a nice observance\r\nof tact and decorum. Noisy hilarity, a hoyden address, egotism,\r\nprolixity, and the unseasonable combination of serious with ludicrous\r\ntopics are equally objectionable, but most of all affectation. Yet\r\nshe ought to be witty, capable of varied conversation in literature,\r\nmusic, and painting, skilled in dancing and festive games. Nor should\r\nthat of a good housewife be wanting to her other qualities. In short,\r\nthe theory of a paragon lady of the 1500 might equally suit for one\r\nof the present day. We should come to a very different conclusion\r\nas to her real character, were we to test it by some passages of\r\nthe _Cortegiano_, wherein the Duchess Elisabetta, in chastity the\r\nmirror of her age, listens approvingly with her courtly dames to long\r\npassages of prurient twaddle, ever skirting and often overstepping\r\nthe limits of decency. Nor were the morals around her conformable to\r\nher own pure example, and that of the immaculate Emilia Pia.[*32]\r\nOne sad instance in the ducal family we shall have to note, while\r\nnarrating the early life of Duke Francesco Maria I.; another,\r\nremarkable from the subsequent status of the personage to whose birth\r\nthe scandal attaches, will immediately be mentioned in connection\r\nwith Giuliano de' Medici.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *32: This lady was the inseparable companion of the Duchess\r\nElisabetta. She was the daughter of Mario Pio, of the Lords of\r\nCarpi. Early the widow of Antonio of Montefeltro, natural brother\r\nof Guidobaldo, she remained at Urbino. She died, as it seems, a\r\ntrue lady of the Renaissance. \"Senza alcun sacramento di la chiesa,\r\ndisputando una parte del Cortegiano col Conte Ludovico da Canosso.\"\r\nCf. Rossi, _Appunti per la storia della musica alla Corte d'Urbino_,\r\nin Rassegna Emiliana, Ann. I. (fasc. VIII.), p. 456, n. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See below, p. 57.]\r\n\r\nBut it would not be just, after adorning our narrative with\r\nflattering sketches from Castiglione's pencil, to exclude one or\r\ntwo anecdotes of the manners actually permitted among the polished\r\nsociety he professes to portray, although their coarseness and\r\nvulgarity, scarcely redeemed by their humour, may be considered as\r\nstaining our pages. They occur in some memorials of the conversation\r\nof Francesco Maria, noted by a contemporary from personal\r\nobservation.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, art. 21. There is a copy of\r\nthis MS. in the library of Newbattle Abbey, Scotland.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of discussion happening to be Mark Antony's weakness\r\nin permitting Cleopatra to accompany him to the fight of Actium,\r\nthe Duke said, \"My father-in-law, the Marquis of Mantua, being at\r\nMortara, in the service of France, Ludovico il Moro was in the\r\ncamp with his Duchess, and one day, seeing the Marquis suffering\r\nfrom violent pain in the shoulder, said to him, 'Sir, I have\r\nthe Duchess here, what shall I do with her?' The Marquis, being\r\notherwise occupied, and suffering great pain, replied, 'How can I\r\ntell? send her to a brothel!' an answer quite off-hand, and truly\r\nappropriate\"--from the brother of our paragon Duchess Elisabetta.\r\n\r\nNiccolo de' Pii, a condottiere in the service of the Duke's father,\r\nwas very fat and overgrown. Dining one day with some Spanish\r\nofficers, after finishing a trout, he sent the head and back-bone\r\nto one of them called Pedrada, who thereupon caustically retorted,\r\n\"It is yourself that has more want of head than of stomach,\" a reply\r\napplauded as most cutting, for, \"having more size than sense, he\r\nneeded the brains rather than the belly.\" The same Spaniard one day,\r\nat a cardinal's reception, began to eat a candle, which, though\r\napparently of wax, was in the centre of tallow; finding it greasy\r\nbetween his teeth, he seized the candlestick, and dashed it on the\r\nfloor, muttering, \"I swear to God it is not silver:\" the candle being\r\ncounterfeit, he fancied the candlestick must needs be so too. When\r\ntalking of absent men, the Duke told these anecdotes of Ottaviano\r\nFregoso, a star of the Urbino circle. As he conversed with his aunt\r\nDuchess Elisabetta, holding her hand, his mind wandered to other\r\nmatters, and he began to twist about her fingers as he would have\r\ndone a switch, finally thrusting one of them into his nose, when a\r\nburst of laughter from the bystanders recalled his thoughts. Dining\r\none day at the table of Julius II., he sheathed and unsheathed his\r\npoignard, jingling the handle, until the Pope, losing all temper,\r\nexclaimed, \"Begone to a brothel, pox take you! Be off, and the\r\ndevil go with you!\" Whereupon Signor Ottaviano began to make humble\r\nexcuses for his natural defect of recollection, to the infinite\r\nglee of many church dignitaries who witnessed the scene. Yet only\r\ntwo days thereafter, chancing to converse in the papal antechamber\r\nwith an ambassador who wore a massive gold chain, he, in a fit of\r\nabstraction, thrust his finger into one of the links. Just then,\r\nhis Holiness appearing, the courtiers drew aside to make way, and\r\nFregoso was dragged along, throwing them all into confusion; nor\r\ncould he get free until he had well \"salivated\" his finger. Yet when\r\nhis wits were not a wool-gathering, this was considered the most\r\nfinished gentleman in Italy, and the most ready in reply. Thus, his\r\nuncle, Duke Guidobaldo appearing one day in a violet satin jerkin\r\nof unexceptionable fit, Ottaviano exclaimed, \"My Lord Duke,\r\nyou really are _the_ handsome Signor!\" \"How disgusting are dull\r\nflatterers who thus openly display their adulation,\" was the stinging\r\nreply. \"My Lord Duke,\" rejoined the courtier, \"I meant not to say\r\nthat you are a man of worth, though I pronounced you a fine man and a\r\nhandsome nobleman;\" an answer which made the Duke wince, and brought\r\ncredit to its author.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nA LADY OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY]\r\n\r\nBut enough of this gossip: the reader of the _Cortegiano_, and its\r\nauthor's charming letters, will find there many more attractive\r\nand not less veracious touches of the Montefeltrian court, where\r\nlearning and accomplishment were often called upon to give dignity\r\nand grace to social pastimes. Thus, the Duchess is represented as\r\nsinging to her lute those verses from the fourth _Æneid_, in which,\r\nat the moment of self-immolation, Dido apostrophised the garments\r\nforgotten by her faithless lover when he fled from her charms, until,\r\nOrpheus-like, she had wiled the savage animals from their lairs, and\r\nset the stones in sympathetic movement. At her court there were no\r\nlack of pens to clothe in verse the passing fancies of the hour, and\r\nadapt them to the musical or melodramatic tastes which gave a tone\r\nof refinement to its amusements. Thus, for the carnival of 1506,\r\nCastiglione and his messmate Cesare Gonzaga composed the pastoral\r\neclogue of _Tirsis_, which was acted by them before the court, with\r\nchoruses and a brilliant moresque dance. The personages of the\r\ndialogue are Iola (Castiglione) and Dameta (Gonzaga), who describe\r\nto Tirsi, a stranger shepherd, the ducal circle of Urbino, with the\r\nDuchess at its head as goddess of the river Metauro. The Moresca, so\r\nnamed from its supposed Moorish origin, was perhaps borrowed from\r\nthe ancient Pyrrhic dance, and consisted in a sort of mock fight,\r\nperformed to the sound of music with measured tread, and blunted\r\npoignards. Next spring a somewhat similar pastoral, from the pen of\r\nBembo, was recited by him and Ottaviano Fregoso to the same audience.\r\n\r\nSuch and such-like were the favourite court diversions of Urbino.\r\nTheir stately conceits and solemn pedantry suited the spirit of that\r\nclassic age and the genius of a pomp-loving people; but it would be\r\nscarcely fair to regard them as fully embodying the tone of manners\r\nprevalent in the palace of Guidobaldo. In it were harmoniously\r\nmingled the opposite qualities which then predominated at the various\r\nItalian courts. Scholastic pretensions, still esteemed in many of\r\nthem, here thawed before the easier address of the new school.\r\nThose abstruse studies which the Medici had brought into vogue were\r\neclipsed by a galaxy of brilliant wits. Even the ruthless bearing of\r\nthe old condottieri princes mellowed under the charm of female tact,\r\nwhile the sensual splendour indulged by recent pontiffs was chastened\r\nby the exemplary demeanour of the ducal pair.\r\n\r\nOur appreciation of this picture would, however, scarcely be\r\ncorrect or complete, did we not bear in mind the inner life of\r\ncontemporary sovereigns. We need not dwell on the contrasts afforded\r\nin other Peninsular capitals, for these were rather of degree than\r\ncharacter, and would only show us the prevalence here of a gentler\r\ncourtesy and more pervading refinement. But we may fairly compare\r\nthe palace-pastimes of Urbino with those held in acceptance by\r\nthe princes and peerage of northern states, where deep potations\r\ndulled the senses, or brutalised the temper; where intellect rarely\r\nsought a more refined gratification than the monotonous recital\r\nof legendary adulation; and where wit was monopolised by dwarfs\r\nand professional jesters. In order better to preserve the form and\r\nfashion of this pattern for princes, we shall transfer to our pages,\r\nfrom Castiglione's groupings, some outlines of its chief ornaments,\r\nbeginning with himself.[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Castiglione was related through his mother to several\r\nof the Urbino stars,--the Fregosi, Trivulzio, and Emilia Pia.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE.\r\n\r\n_Raffaele pinx._ _L. Ceroni sculp._\r\n\r\n_From a picture in the Torlonia Gallery, Rome_]\r\n\r\nFrom CASTIGLIONE, in Lombardy, sprang the ancestry of\r\nCOUNT BALDASSARE, and among them were numbered not a few\r\nnames of note in church and state. His father was no mean soldier,\r\nin times when the captains of Italy bore a European reputation;\r\nhis mother, a Gonzaga of the Mantuan house, was descended from the\r\nhaughty Farinato degli Uberti, who, when accosted by Dante in _The\r\nVision_,--\r\n\r\n         \"His heart and forehead there\r\n     Erecting, seemed as in high scorn he held\r\n     E'en hell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count was born at Casatico, in the Mantuese, on the 6th of\r\nDecember, 1478.[*36] His education, besides including the various\r\nstudies and accomplishments usual to an Italian gentleman of the\r\nfifteenth century, was specially directed to those classical\r\nattainments which entered into the literary pursuits of the age. The\r\ndeath of his father left him early master of a handsome patrimony,\r\nand he at once embraced that courtier-life for which he was\r\npeculiarly fitted,--a life, which in a land subdivided into petty\r\nsovereignties, constituted the only profession open to civilians of\r\nnoble birth and distinguished endowments, and on which his pen was\r\ndestined to confer perpetual illustration. After a brief visit to\r\nMilan,[*37] and a short campaign in Naples with his relative the\r\nMarquis Francesco of Mantua, he repaired to Rome in 1503, where, by\r\ndiscretion and winning address, he quickly gained the new Pontiff's\r\nfavour. In Count Castiglione, the penetration of Julius recognised\r\na fit instrument for promoting his favourite scheme of securing\r\nUrbino to his nephew Francesco Maria della Rovere; and by attaching\r\nhim to Guidobaldo, he fixed at that court a friend whose influence\r\nwas certain to extend itself, and whose example would benefit his\r\nyouthful relation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *36: For the biography of Castiglione, see\r\nMARLIANI in the Cominana edition of the _Opere Volgari_\r\n(Padua, 1733), and SERASSI, in _Poesie volgari e latine del\r\nCastiglione_ (Roma, 1760), as well as the following works:--\r\n\r\nMAZZUCHELLI, _Baldassare Castiglione_ (Narducci, Roma).\r\n\r\nMARTINATI, _Notizie Stor. bibliogr. intorno al Conte B.C._\r\n(Firenze, 1890).

While he was still very\r\nyoung he was attached to the Court of Il Moro. His father died in\r\n1499 from a wound got at the battle of the Taro. He returned to\r\nCasatico on the fall of Sforza, and then joined Marchese Francesco.]\r\n\r\nThe court of Urbino had already been for half a century the brightest\r\nstar in the constellation of Italian principalities, and under\r\nits fostering influence were fully developed those fine qualities\r\nwhich nature and early training had formed in Castiglione. His\r\nfirst essay was as captain of fifty men-at-arms, with 400 ducats\r\nof nominal pay, besides allowances; and his earliest exploit in\r\nthis new service was the reduction of Forlì, in 1504. The finances\r\nof Guidobaldo were necessarily at a low ebb, and it is amusing to\r\nfind Baldassare's frequent lamentations to his mother, over the\r\narrears of his pay:--\"Our doings are jolly but inconsiderable, that\r\nis, on small means; we have never yet seen a farthing, but daily\r\nand most devoutly look for some cash.\" It was not, however, till\r\nnearly a year later that he received twenty-five ducats to account,\r\nhaving often in the interval asked her aid, representing himself as\r\npenniless, and living upon credit. In 1509,[*38] after returning\r\nfrom his mission to England, which peculiarly required the graces\r\nof a finished cavalier, and of which some account will be found in\r\nII. of the Appendix, he attached himself to the Duke's immediate\r\nperson during the brief remainder of his life, and when it closed,\r\nwas sent to Gubbio, to maintain the interests of the succession, in\r\nevent of any popular outbreak. The favour which he had enjoyed from\r\nGuidobaldo was amply continued under his nephew, whose fortunes he\r\nfollowed during several years, sharing his successes in the field,\r\nand sustaining him under his disgrace at the pontifical court. These\r\nevents must, however, be here touched with a flying pen, that we may\r\nnot anticipate details on which we shall afterwards have to dwell.\r\nHis reward was a grant of Novillara, near Pesaro; and when Francesco\r\nMaria had exchanged sovereignty for exile, he returned to the service\r\nof his natural lord, the Marquis of Mantua, whom he long represented\r\nat the court of Leo X. To this Pontiff, Baldassare had nearly become\r\nrelated, by a marriage with his niece Clarice de' Medici, which was\r\ngreatly promoted by Giuliano, during their residence at Urbino.\r\nThe negotiation was, however, broken off in January, 1509, by the\r\nintrigues of her aunt, Lucrezia Salviati, who persuaded her uncle,\r\nthe Cardinal Giovanni, that, by bestowing her hand upon Filippo\r\nStrozzi, he would strengthen the interest of his family at Florence.\r\nThe match having been, according to Italian usage, an interested\r\narrangement, its dissolution was borne with great philosophy by the\r\nintended bridegroom; who some seven years later married Ippolita,\r\ndaughter of Count Guido Torelli, a celebrated condottiere, by\r\nFrancesca, daughter of Giovanni Bentivoglio, Lord of Bologna.[*39]\r\nThe ceremony was performed at Mantua, and was celebrated with\r\ntournaments and pompous shows, in which the court and people took a\r\nlively interest. But their happy union was of brief duration. The\r\nCountess died four years after, in childbed of a daughter. Her name\r\nhas been embalmed in a beautiful Latin ode, wherein her husband\r\nembodied those laments for his absence which he doubtless had often\r\nheard from her lips, expressing all the tenderness of nuptial love,\r\nand adorning a woman's pathos with a poet's fire. Nothing can be more\r\nbeautiful than the allusion to her husband's portrait:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your features portrayed by Raffaele's art\r\n     Alone my longings can solace in part:\r\n     On them I lavish jests and winning wiles,\r\n     As if their words could echo back my smiles;\r\n     At times they seem by gestures to respond,\r\n     And answer in your wonted accents fond:\r\n     Our boy his sire salutes with babbling phrase.\r\n     Such are the thoughts deceive my lingering days.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *38: He was in England in 1506. Guidobaldo died in 1508. It\r\nwas to Duke Francesco he attached himself on his return.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *39: On the various designs for Castiglione's marriage, see\r\nCIAN, _op. cit._, p. 46, note 1.]\r\n\r\nIn her epitaph, the Count summed up his wife's character and\r\nendowments, with a doubt whether her beauty or her virtue were more\r\nremarkable; to which her eulogist, Steffano Guazzo, has added a third\r\ngrace--her learning. During the first anguish of widowhood he was\r\nsupposed to have turned his thoughts to ecclesiastical orders; but\r\nwhatever views of that nature he may have entertained were speedily\r\nabandoned; and in 1523 we find him again in Lombardy, with his\r\ngallant company, under the banner of the Gonzagas.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Clement VII., the Marquis of Mantua again sent\r\nhim to represent his interests at Rome, where he was not long in\r\nobtaining from the new Pope the same favour which he had enjoyed\r\nunder his uncle, Leo X. His diplomatic talents were now acknowledged\r\nas of the first order; and Clement, foreseeing, perhaps, the\r\nimpending difficulties of his position with the Emperor, prevailed\r\nupon Castiglione to accept the nomination of nuncio to Madrid. His\r\ncourtly qualities were not less agreeable to Charles V. and the\r\ngrandees of Spain than they had been in Italy; and in the romantic\r\nproject by which the Emperor proposed to decide in single combat\r\nhis unquenchable rivalry with Francis I., the Count was selected as\r\nhis second,--an honour which his diplomatic functions prevented his\r\naccepting. Even while the troops and name of Charles were used by\r\nBourbon to inflict upon the Apostolic See the greatest blow which\r\nits capital had suffered since the temporal power of the Church\r\nrose on the ruins of the Roman empire, the Nuncio was receiving new\r\nhonours at Madrid, and was only prevented by his own scruples\r\nfrom obtaining the temporalities of the bishopric of Avila, one of\r\nthe richest in Spain. In this most delicate position he retained\r\nthe confidence of his master, who seems to have been satisfied that\r\nto no remissness on his part were owing the horrors of the sack of\r\nRome. But these miserable results of jealousies between the Pope\r\nand the Emperor, which all his tact and influence were powerless to\r\nremove, rendered his position anything but enviable, and appear to\r\nhave preyed alike upon mind and body. He sank under a short illness\r\nat Toledo, on the 2nd of February, 1529,[*40] and was lamented by\r\nCharles as \"one of the best knights in the world.\" A letter of\r\ncondolence, written to his mother by Clement, affords ample evidence\r\nthat the fruitless results of his diplomacy in Spain had nowise\r\ndiminished the Pope's confidence in his good service and attachment\r\nto his person.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *40: He died on February 7th, not 2nd.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nHAIR DRESSING IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n_Detail from the fresco by Pisanello in S. Anastasia of Verona_]\r\n\r\nIn the _Cortegiano_ of Castiglione we are furnished with an\r\nelaborate, and in the main faithful, delineation of the men, the\r\nmanners, and the accomplishments which rendered the court of Urbino\r\na model for his age, and also with an interesting picture of the\r\nimmediate circle which Guidobaldo and his estimable Duchess formed\r\naround them. We have drawn upon it amply for this portion of our\r\nvolumes, but the notices which it affords of the Duke are of the\r\nmost vague and disappointing character. This deficiency would be\r\nof little consequence, did the accounts which the same author\r\nhas left in a Latin letter to Henry VIII. do full justice to his\r\nearly patron. But from one whose opportunities of collecting ample\r\nand authentic particulars were unusual, the passing allusions to\r\nmany momentous incidents are truly unsatisfactory. His details of\r\nscholarship and accomplishments would be more valuable, if divested\r\nof an air of exaggeration which even solemn asseverations of veracity\r\nscarcely remove. With all their faults, these are preferable to the\r\ncompilation of Bembo, to which we shall in due time more particularly\r\nadvert. Those who wade through its laboured and redundant expletives\r\nwill probably come to the conclusion that Castiglione has preserved\r\nwhatever they contain worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nThe Count was a finished gentleman, in an age when that character\r\nincluded a variety of mental acquirements, as well as many personal\r\naccomplishments. His verses in Latin and Italian breathe a fine\r\nspirit of poetry; his letters merit a distinguished place as models\r\nof correspondence; his diplomatic address was highly approved by\r\nthe sovereigns whom he served, as well as by those to whom he\r\nwas accredited; he has been complimented as the delight of his\r\ncontemporaries, the admiration of posterity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGIULIANO DE' MEDICI was third son of Lorenzo the\r\nMagnificent, and was known in the circle of Urbino by the same\r\nappellation. Born in 1478, he passed at that court several years\r\nof his family's exile from Florence; nor was he ungrateful for the\r\nsplendid hospitality he there enjoyed, for, while he lived, his\r\ninfluence with his brother, Leo X., averted those designs against\r\nthe dukedom, which were directed to his own aggrandisement. After\r\nthe restoration of the Medici, Leo confided to him the government of\r\nFlorence, which he endeavoured to administer in the spirit of his\r\nfather, and succeeded in gaining the good will of the people. But\r\nthe Pope was not satisfied with the re-establishment of his race as\r\nsovereigns of that republic; and the fine qualities and vast ideas\r\nof Giuliano suggested him as a fit instrument of further grasping\r\nschemes. To realise these, Leo coquetted between France and Spain,\r\nand, like his predecessors, sacrificed the peace of Italy. The prizes\r\nwhich he successively proposed for Giuliano, who, by resigning\r\nFlorence into the hands of his nephew Lorenzo, the heir-male of his\r\nhouse, was free to accept whatever sovereignty might be had, were\r\nthe duchy of Milan, a state in Eastern Lombardy and Ferrara, or the\r\ncrown of Naples. In June, 1515, the Pontiff conferred on him the\r\ninsignia of gonfaloniere and captain-general of the Church; but he\r\nwas prevented from active service by a fever which cut him off in\r\nthe following March, when only thirty-eight, not without suspicion\r\nof poison at the hands of his nephew Lorenzo. His name is enshrined\r\nin Bembo's prose and Ariosto's verse, whilst his tomb by Michael\r\nAngelo in the Medicean Chapel, which Rogers, with a quaint but happy\r\nantithesis, calls \"the most real and unreal thing which ever came\r\nfrom the chisel,\" is one of the glories of art.[*41] Shortly before\r\nhis death he had married Filiberta of Savoy, whose nephew, Francis\r\nI., created him Duke of Nemours, and, had his life been prolonged,\r\nwould probably have aided him to further aggrandisement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *41: Giuliano was not so bad a poet himself. Cf. on this\r\nsubject SERASSI, in the Annotazioni to the _Tirsi_ of Castiglione at\r\nstanza 43, and the five sonnets contained in _Cod. Palat._, 206 (_I\r\nCod. Palat. della Nazionale Centrale di Firenze_, vol. I., fasc. 4),\r\nand the six of _Cod. Magliabech._ II., I., 60 (BARTOLI, _I manoscritti\r\ndella Bib. Nazionale di Firenze_, tom. I., p. 38).]\r\n\r\nDuring his residence at Urbino, from an intrigue with Pacifica\r\nBrandani, a person of high rank or base condition, for both extremes\r\nhave been conjectured to account for the mystery, there was born to\r\nhim a son, who, after being exposed in the streets in 1511, was sent\r\nto the foundling hospital, and baptized Pasqualino. Removed to Rome\r\nand acknowledged in 1513, the child received an excellent education;\r\nand under the munificent patronage of the Medici became Cardinal\r\nIppolito, whose tastes were more for arms than mass-books, and whose\r\nhandsome features and gallant bearing, expressive of his splendid\r\ncharacter, are preserved to us in the Pitti Gallery by the gorgeous\r\ntints of Titian, alone worthy of such a subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next personage of this goodly company was CESARE\r\nGONZAGA, descended from a younger branch of the Mantuan\r\nhouse, and cousin-german of Count Baldassare, whose quarters he\r\nshared in 1504, when they returned together from the reduction of\r\nValentino's strongholds in Romagna, where he had the command of fifty\r\nmen-at-arms. We know little of him beyond his having been a knight of\r\nSt. John of Jerusalem, and ambassador from Leo X. to Charles V.[*42]\r\nBaldi describes him as not less distinguished by merit than blood,\r\nand Castiglione assigns him a prominent place in the lively circle\r\nwhose amusements he depicts. He was no unsuccessful devotee of the\r\nmuses: a graceful canzonet by him is preserved in the Rime Scelte of\r\nAtanagi, and he shares the credit of the eclogue of _Tirsis_ already\r\nalluded to, and printed among the works of Castiglione. Recommended\r\nby military talent, as well as by diplomatic dexterity and business\r\nhabits, he remained in the service of Duke Francesco Maria during his\r\nearly campaigns; and in September, 1512, after reducing Bologna to\r\nobedience of the Pope, died there of an acute fever in the flower of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *42: SERASSI, in _Poesie volgari e latine del B.C.\r\naggiunti alcune Rime e Lettere di Cesare Gonzaga_ (Roma, 1760), gives\r\na full notice of his life, and CASTIGLIONE, in the Fourth\r\nBook of the _Cortegiano_, speaks affectionately of him.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe brothers OTTAVIANO and FEDERIGO FREGOSO were\r\nof a Genoese family, who for above a century had distinguished\r\nthemselves in the military, naval, and civil service of their\r\ncountry, and had given several doges to that republic. Their father,\r\nAgostino Fregoso, had married Gentile, natural daughter of Duke\r\nFederigo, and the young men were consequently much brought up at\r\nthe court of Urbino, where their sisters Margherita and Costanza\r\nwere long in attendance on Duchess Elisabetta. In 1502, Ottaviano\r\naccompanied his uncle on his first return from Venice, and we have\r\nseen him then defending S. Leo during a lengthened siege, sustained\r\nwith great gallantry and skill. For that good service he had from\r\nthe Duke the countship of Sta. Agatha in the Apennines, afterwards\r\nconfirmed to him by an honourable brief of Leo X., and continued to\r\nhis descendants, with the title of Vicar, until their extinction in\r\nthe third generation.\r\n\r\nThe latter period of Ottaviano's life was actively passed in his\r\nnative city. From 1512 his endeavours were directed to abolish the\r\nFrench domination maintained at that time by aid of the Adorni,\r\nlong hereditary rivals of his family. In this he finally succeeded,\r\nand next year was elected doge, the only one, in Litta's opinion,\r\n\"who gloriously manifested a desire for the public weal.\" He held\r\nthat dignity during two years of tranquillity to his country, over\r\nwhich the benign influence of his mild and impartial sway diffused a\r\ntemporary calm, long unknown to its factious inhabitants. So obvious\r\nwere these beneficial results, that Francis I., on becoming master\r\nof Genoa in 1515, continued to him a delegated authority as its\r\ngovernor. But, seven years later, the restless Adorni, having adhered\r\nto the Emperor, aided the Marquis of Pescara to carry the city,\r\nwith an army of imperialists, who mercilessly sacked it. Ottaviano\r\nremained a prisoner in the enemy's hands, and died soon after. He is\r\ncalled in the _Cortegiano_ \"a man the most singularly magnanimous\r\nand religious of our day, full of goodness, genius, prudence, and\r\ncourtesy; a true friend to honour and virtue, and so worthy of praise\r\nthat even his enemies are constrained to extend it to him.\" The\r\nrevolution effected by Andrea Doria, in 1528, forcibly closed the\r\nfeuds of these rival families, which, during a century and a half,\r\nhad outraged public order, and, both being compelled to change their\r\nname, the Fregosi adopted that of Fornaro.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEDERIGO FREGOSO, the younger brother of Ottaviano,\r\nborn in 1480, was educated for holy orders under the eye of his\r\nmaternal uncle Guidobaldo. In the lettered society of Urbino he\r\nperfected himself in various accomplishments, as well as in a\r\nthorough knowledge of the world, which enabled him afterwards to\r\nacquit himself usefully and creditably in many diversified spheres\r\nof action. It was to the great satisfaction of that court that in\r\nApril, 1507, Julius II. conferred upon him the archbishopric of\r\nSalerno, a benefice which the opposition of Ferdinand II., founded\r\non his leaning to French interests, apparently prevented him from\r\nenjoying. His life of literary ease remained uninterrupted until\r\nhis brother's elevation as doge of Genoa in 1513, when he hastened\r\nto support him by his counsels and influence. During the next nine\r\nyears he alternately commanded the army of the republic, led her\r\nfleet against the Barbary pirates, whom he annihilated in their own\r\nharbours, and represented her as ambassador at the papal court.\r\nThe revolution of 1522 compelled him to fly from his native city,\r\nand, taking refuge in France, he received protection and preferment\r\nfrom Francis I. He returned to Italy in 1529, and was appointed to\r\nthe see of Gubbio, where his piety, and devotion to the spiritual\r\nand temporal welfare of his flock, were equally commendable, and\r\ngained him the appellation of father of the poor and refuge of the\r\ndistressed. A posthumous imputation of heretical error cast upon his\r\nname had no better foundation than the accident of his discourse\r\nupon prayer happening to be reprinted along with a work of Luther,\r\nwhich occasioned their being both consigned to the Index. In 1539 he\r\nwas made cardinal by Paul III., and died at Gubbio two years after.\r\nHis attainments in philology were eminent, including a profound\r\nknowledge of Hebrew, with the study of which he is said to have\r\nconsoled his exile in France. Equal cultivation might have gained\r\nhim much fame as a poet, but the works he has left are chiefly of\r\na doctrinal character, and his eminence in the literary circle of\r\nhis day rests more upon the correspondence of Bembo, Sadoleto, and\r\nCortesio than upon his own writings.[*43] By the first of these, the\r\nsparkle of his measured wit, the general moderation and suavity of\r\nhis manners, his gentle consideration for other men's habits, his\r\npersonal accomplishments, and the zeal displayed in his studies,\r\nare all spoken of with warm admiration. The following letter of\r\nsympathy, addressed to the dowager Duchess by that rhetorician is an\r\ninteresting though mannered tribute to his long friendship:--\r\n\r\n     \"My most illustrious and worshipful Lady,\r\n\r\n     \"I had somewhat dried the tears elicited by the death\r\n     of our very reverend Monseigneur Fregoso, so suddenly\r\n     and inopportunely taken from us, when your Excellency's\r\n     autograph letters recalled them to my eyes, and still\r\n     more abundantly to my heart, on finding that you condoled\r\n     with me so sensibly, and with so much unction. Not only,\r\n     indeed, has your Ladyship been bereaved of a rare friend\r\n     and relative, a most wise and religious gentleman, but,\r\n     as you observe, all Christendom has thus sustained a loss\r\n     incomparably great in times so evil and convulsed. Of\r\n     myself I shall say little, having already written a few\r\n     days ago to your Excellency; and, knowing the affection\r\n     and respect mutually existing between you, I appreciate\r\n     the weight of your grief from my own. Nor can I doubt\r\n     that your Ladyship is aware of my emotion consequent upon\r\n     his long kindness towards me, and my respectful but warm\r\n     affection for him, sentiments never interrupted by a single\r\n     word on either side, from his early youth and my manly age\r\n     down to this day. I am further pained to observe that your\r\n     Ladyship, lamenting for long years your Lord's death of\r\n     happy memory, and now that of the Cardinal, entertains an\r\n     impression your life will be short. This is no fruit of\r\n     that good sense I have ever noticed in you, and which the\r\n     Cardinal himself inculcated; for the more your Ladyship\r\n     is left alone to promote the welfare and advantage of the\r\n     tender plants by your side, you should be more anxious to\r\n     live on; for, while life is given you, you may benefit\r\n     their souls by prayers and good deeds, as well as promote\r\n     the interests of many who look to your pious spirit for the\r\n     prosperity of their lot. Let not, therefore, your Ladyship\r\n     speak thus, but bless (_si conforti_) the Heavenly King\r\n     that he has so willed it, and conform yourself to his\r\n     infallible will and judgment. As to your observation that\r\n     I am left to you, in place of this good gentleman, as a\r\n     protector, father, and brother, be assured that the day\r\n     shall never come when it will not be my desire to dispose\r\n     of myself in all respects according to your Excellency's\r\n     pleasure, yielding therein not even to your [late] most\r\n     reverend brother. Your Ladyship will consider me as truly,\r\n     really, and justly your own, to use and dispose of me\r\n     unreservedly; and for this end I give, grant, and give over\r\n     to you full leave and power, not to be reclaimed by any\r\n     change of fortune so long as life remains to me. In return\r\n     I shall now pray you to attend to your health, and not only\r\n     to live on, but live as happily as you can, thus avenging\r\n     yourself of fate, which has done so much to vex you....\r\n     From Rome, the 2nd of August, 1541.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *43: Cf.

Having learned Greek at\r\nMessina under Constantin Lascaris, and studied philosophy at Padua\r\nand Ferrara, he devoted himself to literary pursuits. At the court\r\nof the d'Este princes, where he was introduced by his father then\r\nresident as envoy from Venice, he met with the consideration\r\ndue to his acquirements, and found a brilliant society, including\r\nSadoleto, the Strozzi, and Tibaldeo. There he was residing when the\r\narrival of Lucrezia Borgia threatened to establish for it a very\r\ndifferent character; but the dissolute beauty seems to have left\r\nin the Vatican her abandoned tastes, and adopting those of her new\r\nsovereignty she became distinguished as a patroness of letters.\r\nThe intimacy which sprang up between this princess and Bembo has\r\ngiven rise to some controversy as to the purity of its platonism, a\r\ndiscussion into which we need not enter. The life of the lady, the\r\nwritings of the Abbé, and the morals of their time combine to justify\r\nsuspicion, where proofs can hardly be looked for.[*45]\r\n\r\n     \"But if their solemn love were crime,\r\n       Pity the beauty and the sage,--\r\n       Their crime was in their darkened age!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *44: For a splendid account of Bembo, cf.

The Ambrosian Library at Milan\r\npossesses nine autograph epistles in Italian and Latin from Lucrezia,\r\naddressed \"to my dearest M. Pietro Bembo,\" with the dates supplied in\r\nhis hand. A tress of fair auburn hair, originally tied up with them,\r\nand doubtless that of the Princess, is now shown in the adjoining\r\nmuseum. That her tastes and accomplishments were not unworthy of such\r\na friendship appears from many dedications of works to her while\r\nDuchess of Ferrara, including the Asolani of her admirer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *46: Cf. MORSOLIN, _P. Bembo e Lucrezia Borgia_,\r\nin the _Nuova Antologia_ (Roma, 1885), and BEMBO, _Opere_\r\n(Venice, 1729), vol. III., pp. 307-17; also CIAN, in _Giorn.\r\nStor. della Lett.

Besides enjoying the converse of many congenial\r\nspirits, he there formed a friendship with Giuliano de' Medici, to\r\nwhich he owed many subsequent honours. Accompanying him to Rome in\r\n1512, he was recommended by him to his brother, the Cardinal, whose\r\nfirst act on being chosen Pope in the following year, was to name\r\nBembo his secretary, jointly with his friend Sadoleto. For this\r\nsituation he was in many respects well fitted, by the happy union\r\nof great learning with an extensive knowledge of men and manners,\r\nwhich his residence at Ferrara and Urbino had not failed to impart.\r\nThe laxity of his morals, and the paganism of his ideas, were\r\nunfortunately no disqualifications under Leo X. He continued to earn\r\nhis master's confidence in the discharge of his regular duties, as\r\nwell as in occasional diplomatic missions, but, as Roscoe truly\r\nobserves, his success as a negotiator did not equal his ability in\r\nofficial correspondence. The pensions and benefices which rewarded\r\nhis services enriched him for life, and even before that Pontiff's\r\ndeath he sought at Padua an elegant literary retirement, refusing\r\nfrom Clement VII., and from the Signory of Venice, all offers of\r\npublic employment. He surrounded himself with a most select library,\r\nincluding many invaluable manuscripts, and a precious collection\r\nof medals and other antiquities, which, with the society of the\r\nlearned whom he attracted to his board, gave to his house a wide\r\ncelebrity. It was not regarded as at all degraded by the presence\r\nof an avowed mistress at its head, with whom he openly lived for\r\nmany years, and had several children; and neither this scandal,\r\nnor the gross indecency of some of his writings, prevented Paul\r\nIII. from conferring upon him a scarlet hat in 1539. He is said to\r\nhave accepted this dignity unwillingly, but having done so, he had\r\nthe good sense at all events to \"cleanse the outside of the cup\r\nand platter.\" His mistress was now dead; he laid aside poetry,\r\nliterature, and pagan idioms, and, devoting himself to theological\r\nstudies, at which he had formerly sneered in the habit of an abbé,\r\nhe entered holy orders at the mature age of sixty-nine. In 1541 he\r\nsucceeded Fregoso, his early companion at Urbino, in the bishopric\r\nof Gubbio, to which was added that of Bergamo. How little these\r\npreferments contributed to his comfort appears from a letter to\r\nVeronica Gambara in December, 1543. \"Often,\" he there says, \"do I\r\ndesire to be the unfettered Bembo of other days, rather than as\r\nI now am. But what better can one make of it? Man's existence,\r\nabounding more in crosses than in gratifying incidents, will have it\r\nso; and wiser he who least desponds and best puts up to necessity,\r\nthan one that less conforms to it. Yet I own myself unable to do\r\nthis amid these privations, and exiled in a manner from myself.\r\nFor verily I am neither at Venice nor Padua, as your Ladyship\r\nsupposes, but at my church of Gubbio, a very wild place to say the\r\ntruth, and offering few conveniences.\" He died at Rome six years\r\nafter, in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried in the church of\r\nthe Minerva, between his patrons Leo X. and Clement VII., where a\r\nmodest flag-stone is all the memorial that his natural son and heir,\r\nTorquato, bestowed on one of the most famous men of his age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the town of Bibbiena, in the upper Val d'Arno, there were born\r\nabout 1470, of humble parentage, two brothers, whose business talents\r\nprocured them remarkable advancement. The elder, Pietro Dovizi,\r\nbecame a secretary of Lorenzo de' Medici, into whose family he\r\nintroduced his brother BERNARDO. There this youth gained\r\nfor himself so good a reputation, that he was allowed to share the\r\ninstructions bestowed upon his patron's younger son Giovanni. A close\r\nintimacy gradually sprang up between these fellow students, which\r\nthe similarity of their talents, their tastes, and their pursuits\r\nripened into lasting friendship. Identifying himself with the\r\nMedici, he followed their fortunes into exile, and attended Giuliano\r\nto Urbino, where he was received with the welcome there extended to\r\nall who, like him, combined the scholar and the gentleman. But this\r\nhospitality met with a very different return from these two guests.\r\nOf Giuliano's generous forbearance to second the evil designs of his\r\nbrother, the Pope, against the state which had sheltered him, we have\r\nlately spoken. When we come to narrate the usurpation of the duchy by\r\nthe Medici in 1516-17, we shall find in command of their invading army\r\n\r\n     \"That courteous Sir, who honours and adorns\r\n     Bibbiena, spreading far and high its fame,\"\r\n\r\nand who had adopted that town as a substitute for his own\r\nundistinguished patronymic. This ingratitude was the more odious if,\r\nas it was probable, he owed to Guidobaldo, or his nephew, the favour\r\nof Julius II., who first brought him forward in the public service.\r\n\r\nAt that Pontiff's death he was acting as secretary to his early\r\nfriend, the Cardinal de' Medici, and in that capacity was admitted\r\nto the conclave. The intrigues which there effected his patron's\r\nelection have given rise to various anecdotes and controversies,\r\nwhich we pass by with the single remark that, by all accounts, the\r\naddress of Dovizi was not unimportant to the success of Leo X. In\r\nreturn, he was included in the first distribution of scarlet hats\r\nas CARDINAL BIBBIENA. In this enlarged sphere his talents\r\nand tastes had full room for exercise. He was selected for various\r\nimportant diplomatic trusts, besides filling the offices of treasurer\r\nand legate in the war of Urbino. With his now ample means, his\r\npatronage of letters and arts had ample scope, and he was regarded\r\nas the Maecenas of a court rivalling that of Augustus. Raffaele\r\nenjoyed his particular regard, which he would willingly have proved\r\nby bestowing on him the hand of his niece.\r\n\r\nHis ambition is alleged to have exceeded even the rise of his\r\nfortunes, and to have prompted him to contemplate, and possibly to\r\nintrigue for, his own elevation to the chair of St. Peter, in the\r\nevent of a vacancy. His sudden death in 1520, soon after a residence\r\nof above a year as legate to Francis I. (who had conferred upon him\r\nthe see of Constance), when coupled with such reports, was construed\r\nas the effect of poison administered by Leo. Indeed, his friend,\r\nLudovico Canossa, observed that it was a received dogma among the\r\nFrench at that very time that every man of station who died in Italy\r\nwas poisoned. But such vague conjectures, however specious under\r\nAlexander VI., are less credible in other pontificates; and if the\r\nCardinal were poisoned, that practice was then by no means limited\r\nto popes. He was an accomplished dilettante when the standards of\r\nbeauty were of pagan origin; and his intimacy with Raffaele dated\r\nafter the painter's Umbrian inspirations had faded before a gradual\r\nhomage to the \"new manner.\" Like his friend Bembo, his morals were\r\nepicurean to the full licence of a dissolute age. His famed comedy\r\nof the _Calandra_,[*47] which was brought out at Urbino in 1508,\r\nand which gave full play to his exquisite sense of the ridiculous,\r\njustifies this charge, and all that we have so often to repeat of the\r\nlaxity then prevalent in the most refined Italian circles. A notice\r\nof this, the only important production of his pen, and an account of\r\nits being magnificently performed before Guidobaldo, will be found\r\nin our twenty-fifth chapter. Those who regard the pontificate of Leo\r\nX. as the classic period of Italian letters must feel grateful to\r\nCardinal Bibbiena for developing a portion of its lustre; the sterner\r\nmoralist, who brands its vices, will charge him with pandering\r\nfreely to the licence of a court of which he was a notable ornament.\r\nCastiglione tells us that an acute and ready genius rendered him the\r\ndelight of all his acquaintance; and Baldi adds, that by practice\r\nin the papal court he so improved that gift, that his tact in\r\nbusiness was unrivalled, to which his mild address, and happy talent\r\nof seasoning the dullest topics with graceful pleasantry, greatly\r\ncontributed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *47: For all concerning this play and its performance at\r\nUrbino in 1513, see VERNARECCI, _Di Alcune Rappresentazioni\r\nDrammatiche alla Corte d'Urbino nel 1513_ in _Archivio Storico per\r\nle Marche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 181 _et seq._ The original\r\nprologue, by Bibbiena, was only recently made known by DEL\r\nLUNGO, _La Recitazione dei Menaechmi in Firenze e il doppio\r\nprologo della Calandria_, in the _Arch. Stor. Ital._, series III.,\r\nvol. XXII., pp. 346-51. Machiavelli's estimate of Bibbiena will be\r\nfound in _Lettere Famil. di N. Machiavelli_, Firenze, 1883, p. 304,\r\n\"Bibbiena, hora cardinale, in verità ha gentile ingegno, ed è homo\r\nfaceto et discreto, et ha durato a' suoi di gran fatica.\"]\r\n\r\nHis personal beauty obtained for him the adjunct of _bel_ Bernardo,\r\nand he is represented in the _Cortegiano_ as saying, in reference to\r\nthe amount of good looks desirable for a gentleman, \"Such grace and\r\nbeauty of feature are, I doubt not, mine, in consequence whereof,\r\nas you know, so many women are in love with me; but I have some\r\nmisgivings as to my figure, especially these legs of mine, which, to\r\nsay the truth, don't seem to me quite what I should like, though I am\r\nwell enough satisfied with my bust, and all the rest.\" This, however,\r\nhaving been introduced as a jest, may perhaps be understood rather as\r\ncomplimentary to his person, than as a sarcasm on his vanity.\r\n\r\nA contemporary and unsparing pen thus sketches his qualities, in a\r\nmanuscript printed by Roscoe, from the Vatican archives:--\"He was a\r\nfacetious character, with no mean powers of ridicule, and much tact\r\nin promoting jocular conversation by his wit and well-timed jests.\r\nHe was a great favourite with certain cardinals, whose chief pursuit\r\nwas pleasure and the chase, for he thoroughly knew all their habits\r\nand fancies, and was even aware of whatever vicious propensities they\r\nhad. He likewise possessed a singular pliancy for flattery, and for\r\nobsequiously accommodating himself to their whims, stooping patiently\r\nto be the butt of insulting and abusive jokes, and shrinking from\r\nnothing which could render him acceptable to them. He also had much\r\nreadiness in council, and was perfectly able seasonably to qualify\r\nhis wit with wisdom, or to dissemble with singular cunning.\" Bembo,\r\nwith more partial pen, says in a letter to Federigo Fregoso, \"The\r\ndays seem years until I see him, and enjoy the pleasing society, the\r\ncharming conversation, the wit, the jests, the features, and the\r\naffection of that man.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished literary names which have issued from Arezzo,\r\nseveral members of the ACCOLTI family were conspicuous in the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries. BERNARDO,[*48] of whom we are now to speak,\r\nhad a father noted as a historian, a brother and a nephew who reached\r\nthe dignity of cardinal, and were remarkable in politics and letters.\r\nHe obtained from Leo X. the fief of Nepi, as well as various offices\r\nof trust and emolument; of these, however, his wealth rendered him\r\nindependent, enabling him to indulge in a life of literary ease. His\r\npoetical celebrity exceeded that of his contemporaries, and seems\r\nto have been his chief recommendation at the court of Guidobaldo.\r\nThere, and at Rome, he was in the habit of reciting his verses in\r\npublic to vast audiences, composed of all that was brilliant in\r\nthese cultivated capitals. Nor was his popularity limited to a\r\nlettered circle. When an exhibition was announced, the shops were\r\nclosed, the streets emptied, and guards restrained the crowds who\r\nrushed to secure places among his audience. This extraordinary\r\nenthusiasm appears the more unaccountable, when we find his printed\r\npoetry characterised by a bald and stilted style, which leaves no\r\npleasing impression on the reader. The mystery seems explained by a\r\nsupposition that his talent lay in extemporary declamation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *48: On the Unico Aretino Bernardo Accolti, see especially\r\nD'ANCONA, _Studi sulla Lett. Ital. de' primi secoli_ (Ancona, 1884),\r\nin the essay, _Del Seicentismo nella poesia cortigiana del Secolo XV._,\r\npp. 217-18. He professed an extraordinary devotion for the Duchess of\r\nUrbino.]\r\n\r\nInstances are far from uncommon in Italy, of similar effects produced\r\nby the _improvisatori_, whose torrent of melodious words, directed\r\nto a popular theme, and accompanied by music and impassioned\r\ngesticulation, hurries the feelings of a sympathising auditory to\r\nbursts of tumultuous applause, whilst on cool perusal, the same\r\ncompositions fall utterly vapid on the reader. Be this as it may,\r\nthe success of Accolti had the common result of superficial powers,\r\nand so egregiously inflated his vanity, that he assumed as his usual\r\ndesignation \"the unique Aretine,\" by which he is always accosted\r\nin the _Cortegiano_. Nine years later we find him devoting to\r\nDuchess Elisabetta attentions which were attributed to a passion\r\nmore powerful than gratitude, but which, knowing as he well did,\r\nher immaculate modesty, could only have been prompted by despicable\r\nvanity, and hence exposed him to keen ridicule.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo few of the pedigrees illustrated by Sansovino is there attributed\r\na more remote origin, or a brighter illustration, than to that of\r\nCANOSSA.[*49] A younger son of the family was COUNT LUDOVICO, who,\r\nbeing cousin-german of Castiglione's mother, was perhaps by this\r\nmeans brought to Urbino, and thence recommended to Julius II., under\r\nwhose patronage he entered upon an ecclesiastical career. From Leo\r\nX. he obtained the see of Tricarico, and was sent by him as nuncio\r\nto England and France, a service which earned him promotion to the\r\nbishopric of Bajus. Adrian VI. and Clement VII. continued him in this\r\npost; and during a long residence at the French court, he entirely\r\ngained the confidence and favour of Francis I. Many of his diplomatic\r\nletters are printed in various collections; and to him is addressed\r\nCount Baldassare's curious description of the performance of the\r\n_Calandra_, at Urbino.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *49: For Canossa, cf. LUZIO E RENIER, _op.\r\ncit._, p. 87, and especially ORTI-MANARA, _Intorno alla\r\nvita ed alle gesta del Co. Lodovico di Canossa_ (Verona, 1845), and\r\nCAVATTONI, _Lettere scelte di Mons. L. di Canossa_ (Verona,\r\n1862).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALESSANDRO TRIVULZIO was nephew of Gian Giacomo, the\r\ndistinguished Milanese general of that name, and himself a famous\r\ncaptain in the service of Florence, and of Francis I. Sigismondo\r\nRiccardi, surnamed the Black, Gasparo Pallavicini, Pietro da\r\nNapoli, and Roberto da Bari,--the last of whom died in the camp of\r\nDuke Francesco Maria, in 1510,--are mentioned among the military\r\nnotorieties of the Feltrian court. Giovanni Cristoforo, the sculptor,\r\nmay be added to the list of its literary dilettanti; and among its\r\nmusical ornaments were Pietro Monti and Terpandro, with Niccolo\r\nFrisio, a German, long resident in the land of song, whose exertions\r\nwere often in request by Monti and Barletta, both dancers of note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n     Emilia Pia--The _Cortegiano_--Death of Duke Guidobaldo,\r\n     succeeded by Francesco Maria della Rovere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the eminent men, with whom Guidobaldo is described in the\r\n_Cortegiano_ as living in easy but dignified familiarity, joining\r\ntheir improving and amusing conversation, or admiring their dexterity\r\nin exercises which his broken constitution no longer permitted him\r\nto share. Thus passed the days in the palace; and, when the Duke was\r\nconstrained by his infirmities to seek early repose, the evenings\r\nwere spent in social amusements, over which the Duchess gracefully\r\npresided, with her ladies Margherita and Costanza Fregoso, the Duke's\r\nnieces, Margherita and Ippolita Gonzaga, the Signor Raffaella, and\r\nMaria Emilia Pia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELISABETTA GONZAGA, DUCHESS OF URBINO\r\n\r\n_From a lead medal by Adriano Fiorentino in the British Museum_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMILIA PIA\r\n\r\n_From a medal by Adriano Fiorentino in the Vienna Museum_]\r\n\r\nOf the social position of Italian women in this century[*50] we\r\nmay gather many particulars from Ludovico Dolce's _Instituto delle\r\nDonne_: for although, like most writers on similar themes, he\r\nrepresents them \"not as they are, but as they ought to be,\" still,\r\nknowing the then received standard of female perfection, we can form\r\na pretty accurate estimate of their actual qualities. His views\r\nas to education are exceedingly orthodox. The Holy Scriptures,\r\nwith the commentaries of the fathers, Ambrose, Augustin, and\r\nJerome, ought to be day and night before a girl, and suffice for\r\nher religious and moral discipline. She should be familiar with her\r\nown language and with Latin, but Greek is an unnecessary burden.\r\nFor mental occupation, Plato, Seneca, and such other philosophers\r\nas supply sound moral training are excellent, as well as Cicero for\r\nbright examples and wholesome counsels. History being the teacher\r\nof life, all classical historians are commended, but the Latin\r\npoets are vetoed as unfit for honest women, except most of Virgil\r\nand a few selections from Horace. Many modern Latin writers are\r\ncommended, especially the _Christeida_ of Sannazaro and Vida, but\r\nall such prurient productions in Italian as Boccaccio's novels are\r\nto be shunned like venomous reptiles. On the other hand, the poetry\r\nof Petrarch and Dante is extolled beyond measure, the former as\r\nembodying with singular beauty an instance of the purest and most\r\nhonourable love, the latter as an admirable portraiture of all\r\nChristian philosophy. Yet such literary occupations should never\r\nintrude upon more important matters, such as prayer, nor upon the\r\ndomestic duties of married women.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *50: The books, pamphlets, poems, and stories, both\r\ncontemporary and subsequent, dealing with the position, beauty,\r\nlearning, dress, etc., of women would fill a library. I shall content\r\nmyself by naming a very few among them under a few headings for\r\nthe entertainment of the reader. The list of works I give is, of\r\ncourse, in no sense a bibliography. The best source is _Castiglione_\r\nhimself--for the sixteenth century and for court life, at any rate.\r\nBut the picture he paints, remarkable as it is, was by no means\r\naltogether realistic, as a consultation with the following works will\r\nshow.

Thus,\r\nexcessive luxury of dress, and, above all, painting the face and\r\ntinging the hair, are attacked as impious attempts to improve upon\r\nGod's own handiwork. In like manner, the assiduity with which modesty\r\nand purity of mind and person are inculcated confirms what we\r\notherwise know of the unbridled licentiousness then widely diffused\r\nover society. Gaming of every sort is scouted; music and dancing are\r\nset down as matters of indifference.\r\n\r\nIn regard to marriage, the selection of a husband is left as matter\r\nof course to the parents, since a girl is necessarily too ignorant\r\nof the world to choose judiciously for herself; a reason resulting\r\nfrom the education and social circumstances of young women in Italy,\r\nwhich sufficiently accounts for this apparent solecism continuing in\r\nthe present day. A prolix exposition of the principles which ought to\r\nguide fathers in their discharge of this delicate duty may be summed\r\nup in the very pertinent remark, that few prudent damsels would\r\nrather weep in brocaded silks than smile in homely stuffs.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to return from this digression to the LADY\r\nEMILIA PIA, who merits more special notice in a sketch of the\r\nMontefeltrian court. She was sister of Giberto Pio, Lord of Carpi in\r\nLombardy, and wife of Antonio, natural brother of Duke Guidobaldo.\r\nAfter losing her husband in the flower of youth, she remained at\r\nUrbino, and became one of its prime ornaments, not only by her\r\npersonal attractions, but by a variety of more lasting qualities.\r\nThe part she sustains in the conversation of the _Cortegiano_ amply\r\nevinces the charm which attached to her winning manners, as well as\r\nthe ready tact wherewith she played off an extent of knowledge and\r\ngraceful accomplishment rare even in that age of female genius. She\r\nwas at all times ready and willing to lead or second the learned\r\nor sportive pastimes by which the gay circle gave zest to their\r\nintercourse and polish to their wit, and thus was of infinite use to\r\nthe Duchess, whose acquirements were of a less sparkling quality, and\r\nof whom she was the inseparable companion. Still more singular and\r\nproportionately admired were the decorum that marked her conduct in\r\ncircumstances of singular difficulty and the virtue which maintained\r\na spotless reputation amid temptations and lapses regarded as venial\r\nin the habits of a lax age. Her death occurred about 1530,[*51]\r\nand an appropriate posthumous tribute was paid to such graces and\r\nvirtues in this medallion bearing her portrait, with the Latin motto,\r\n\"To her chaste ashes,\" on the reverse. Even the luscious verses in\r\nwhich Bembo and Castiglione sang the seductions of the Feltrian\r\ncourt assumed a loftier tone in their tribute to her heart of\r\nadamant, which, \"pious by name[52] and cruel by nature,\" and spurning\r\nthe designs of Venus upon its wild freedom, would impart its own\r\nseverity generally to the slaves of the goddess. Yet it was under the\r\nguidance of this able mistress of the revels, that joy and merriment\r\nsupplanted rigorous etiquette in the palace of Urbino, where\r\nfrankness was restrained from excess by the Duchess' example, and\r\nwhere all were free to promote the common entertainment as their wit\r\nor fancy might suggest. Among the sports of these after-supper hours,\r\nCastiglione enumerates questions and answers, playful arguments\r\nseasoned with smart rejoinders, the invention of allegories and\r\ndevices, repartees, mottoes, and puns, varied by music and dancing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *51: She died in 1528, not as Serassi, whom Dennistoun\r\nfollows, says, in 1530.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Her maiden surname, Pio, was habitually punned into\r\nPia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nHAIR DRESSING IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n_After a picture by Bissolo_]\r\n\r\nSuch was the mode of life described in the _Cortegiano_, with ample\r\ndetails, which we shall attempt slightly to sketch. The scene is\r\nlaid in the evenings immediately succeeding the visit of Julius II.\r\nThe usual circle being assembled in her drawing-room, the Duchess\r\ndesired Lady Emilia to set some game a-going.[*53] She proposed\r\nthat every person in turn should name a new amusement, and that the\r\none most generally approved should be adopted.[54] This fancy was\r\nsanctioned by her mistress, who delegated to her full authority to\r\nenforce it upon all the gentlemen, but exempted the ladies from\r\ncompetition. The courtiers so called upon thus acquitted themselves\r\nof their task. Gaspar Pallavicino suggested that each should state\r\nthe peculiar excellence and special defect which he would prefer\r\nfinding in the lady of his love. Cesare Gonzaga, assuming that all\r\nhad some undeveloped tendency to folly, desired that every one should\r\nstate on what subject he would rather play the fool. Fra Serafino\r\nsneeringly proposed that they should successively say why most women\r\nhate rats and like snakes. The Unico Aretino, whose turn came next,\r\nthought that the party might try one by one to guess at the occult\r\nmeaning of an ornament, in the form of an S, worn by the Duchess\r\non her forehead. The flattery with which this odd suggestion was\r\nspiced, gave a clue to the Lady Emilia, who exclaimed that, none but\r\nhimself being competent, he ought to solve the mystery; on which,\r\nafter a pause of apparent abstraction, he recited a sonnet on that\r\nconceit, giving an air of impromptu to what was, in fact, a studied\r\ncomposition clumsily introduced. Ottaviano Fregoso wished to know on\r\nwhat point each would be most willing to undergo a lover's quarrel.\r\nBembo, refining on this idea, was of opinion that the question ought\r\nto be whether the cause of quarrel had best originate with oneself\r\nor with one's sweetheart--whether it was most vexatious to give or\r\nreceive the offence. Federigo Fregoso, premising his conviction that\r\nnowhere else in Italy were there found such excellent ingredients of\r\na court, from the sovereign downwards, proposed that one chosen from\r\nthe party should state the qualities and conditions required to form\r\nA PERFECT COURTIER, it being allowed to the others to object\r\nand redargue in the manner of a scholastic disputation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *53: Cf. _Il Cortegiano_, lib. I., cap. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: DOLCE, in the _Instituto delle Donne_,\r\nmentions a lady who, being asked to name some pastime at a party,\r\nsent for a basin and towel, that all of her sex might wash their\r\nfaces, she being the only one present without paint.]\r\n\r\nThis idea being approved by the Duchess and her deputy, the latter\r\ncalled upon Count Ludovico Canossa to begin the theme. Its discussion\r\n(our observations upon which must be reserved for a future portion\r\nof these pages) is represented by Castiglione as having been\r\nprolonged during successive evenings; Federigo Fregoso, Giuliano the\r\nMagnificent, Cesare Gonzaga, Ottaviano Fregoso, and Pietro Bembo,\r\nfollowing the cue with which Canossa had opened. At the close of the\r\nfourth sitting, an argument on love was interrupted by daylight.\r\n\"Throwing open the eastern windows of the palace, they saw the summit\r\nof Monte Catri already tipped with rosy tints of the radiant Aurora,\r\nand all the stars vanished except Venus, the mild pilot of the sky,\r\nwho steers along the limits of night and day. From these far-off\r\npeaks there seemed to breathe a gentle breeze, that tempered the\r\nair with bracing freshness, and, from the rustling groves of the\r\nadjacent hills, began to awaken sweet notes of wandering birds.\" The\r\nsame golden sun continues to dawn upon Urbino, but, ere many months\r\nhad passed, the bright galaxy of satellites that circled round Duke\r\nGuidobaldo was scattered, for their guiding star had gone to another\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring fifteen years his fine form and robust constitution had been\r\nwasted by gout, for such was the name given to a disease hereditary\r\nin his family. Physiologists may decide upon the accuracy of\r\nthis term, and say why, in an age of incessant exposure to severe\r\nexercise under all weather, and when luxuries of the table were\r\nlittle known or appreciated, the ravages of that malady should\r\nhave been more virulent than in our days of comparative indulgence\r\nand effeminacy.[55] At first he struggled against the symptoms,\r\ncontinuing his athletic sports; but in a few years he was reduced to\r\na gentle pace on horseback, or to a litter. At length, about the time\r\nof which we are now speaking, his intervals of ease rarely extended\r\nto a month, during which he was carried about in a chair; but, when\r\nunder a fit, was confined to bed in great agony. Yet, ever tended by\r\nhis wife, his fortitude never forsook him, and his mind, gathering\r\nstrength in the decay of nature, sought occupation in the converse\r\nof those able men who made his palace their home, or, in the moments\r\nof most acute suffering, fell back for distraction upon the vast\r\nstores of his prodigious memory, whiling away long hours of agony by\r\nrepeating passages from his favourite authors. The palliations of\r\nmedicine lost their effects; his enfeebled frame became more and more\r\nsensitive to acute pain; in his emaciated figure few could recognise\r\nthe manly beauty of his youthful person; life had prematurely become\r\nto him an irksome burden.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Sanuto strangely ascribes his death to _mal Francese_,\r\nan example of the way in which that ill-understood scourge was then\r\nassumed as the origin of many fatal maladies.]\r\n\r\nThere occurred in Italy at this period a very unnatural change of\r\nthe seasons. On the 7th of April, 1505, snow fell at Urbino to the\r\ndepth of a foot, and scarcity prevailed, followed in June by a\r\nmurrain among cattle. From September, 1506, until January, 1508,\r\nit is said that no rain or snow fell, except during a few days of\r\nviolent torrents in April. The fountains failed, the springs became\r\nexhausted, the rivers dried up, grain was hand-ground for want of\r\nwater. The crops were scarcely worth reaping, the pastures were\r\nscorched, and the fruitless vines shrivelled under an ardent sun.[56]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56:\r\n\r\n     \"Una stagion fu già, che sì il terreno\r\n     Arse, che 'l sol di nuovo a Faetonte\r\n     De' suoi corsier parea aver dato il freno:\r\n       Secco ogni pozzo, secco era ogni fonte,\r\n     Gli stagni, i rivi, e i fiumi più famosi,\r\n     Tutti passar si potean senza ponte.\"\r\n\r\n     ARIOSTO, _Satira_ iii.\r\n\r\n*Cf. MADIAI, _Diario_, in _Arch. cit._, vol. _cit._, p. 455.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, December was turned into July; the orchards\r\nbore a second crop of apples, pears, plums, and mulberries, from\r\nwhich were prepared substitutes for wine, then worth a ducat the\r\n_soma_; strawberries and blackberries ripened in the wood-lands,\r\nand luxuriant roses were distilled in vast quantities at Christmas.\r\nWith the new year things underwent a sudden revolution, and January\r\nset in with unwonted rigour. The delicacy of the Duke's now reduced\r\nframe rendered him peculiarly sensitive to the atmospheric phenomena.\r\nThe long drought had especially affected all gouty patients, and\r\nthe severe weather so aggravated his sufferings that, on the 1st\r\nof February, he was, by his own desire, removed in a litter to\r\nFossombrone. That town is situated on the north side of the Metauro,\r\nlying well to the sun, and little above the sea level, from which\r\nit is distant about fifteen miles, and has thus the most genial\r\nspring climate in the duchy. At first the change was in all respects\r\nbeneficial, and revived the hopes of an attached circle who had\r\naccompanied the Duchess. But in April winter returned, and with it a\r\nrelapse into the worst symptoms, which soon carried him off. Although\r\nhis great sufferings were borne with extraordinary fortitude, he\r\nlooked forward to death as an enviable release; and when his last\r\nhour approached, he regarded it with calm resignation. To his\r\nchaplain he confessed, as one whose worldly account was closed; and\r\nhe acquitted himself of those testamentary duties to his church and\r\nto the poor, which his creed considers saving works; directing at\r\nthe same time the disposal of his body. Then calling to his bedside\r\n(where the Duchess and Amelia were in unwearied attendance) his\r\nnephew the Lord Prefect, Castiglione, Ottaviano Fregoso, and other\r\ndear friends, he addressed to them words of consolation. Their hopes\r\nfor his recovery he mildly reproved, adapting to himself the lines of\r\nVirgil:--\r\n\r\n     \"Me now Cocytus bounds with squalid reeds,\r\n     With muddy ditches, and with deadly weeds,\r\n     And baleful Styx encompasses around\r\n     With nine slow-circling streams the unhappy ground.\"[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57:\r\n\r\n     \"Me circum limus niger et deformis arundo\r\n     Cocyti, tardaque palus, inamabilis unda,\r\n     Alligat, et novies Styx interfusa coercet.\"\r\n\r\n     VIRG. _Georg._ iv. 478.]\r\n\r\nTo the Duchess and to his nephew were chiefly addressed his parting\r\ninjunctions, the object of which was to recommend them to each\r\nother's affection and confidence, to comfort them under their\r\napproaching bereavement, and to counsel implicit obedience on the\r\npart of Francesco Maria towards his uncle the Pope. It seems enough\r\nto allude thus generally to his closing scene, for the accounts which\r\nwe have from Castiglione and Federigo Fregoso, one a spectator, the\r\nother a dear friend, who quickly reached the spot, are unfortunately\r\ndisguised in Ciceronianisms, necessarily inappropriate to a Christian\r\ndeath-bed, and in which the spirit of his words has probably\r\nevaporated.[58] We may, however, trust that\r\n\r\n                       \"They show\r\n     The calm decay of nature, when the mind\r\n     Retains its strength, and in the languid eye\r\n     Religious holy hope kindles a joy;\"\r\n\r\nfor we have seen him neither indifferent nor neglectful of the\r\nobservances dictated by his Church, and, ere the vital spark fled, he\r\nreceived its rites and besought the prayers of the bystanders. His\r\npassage from mortality was peaceful, and death, which he considered\r\ndesirable, spread like a gentle slumber over his stiffening limbs\r\nand composed features. At midnight of the 11th of April his spirit\r\nwas released from its shattered tenement.[*59] Over the agonised\r\nand uncontrolled lamentations of the Duchess we draw a veil; the\r\ndescription of such scenes must ever degenerate into common-place\r\ngeneralities. She felt and suffered as was natural to the best wives\r\nprematurely severed from the most attached of husbands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: What are we to make of the words of Fregoso (as\r\npreserved by Bembo)--an archbishop who, in describing to the Pope his\r\nuncle's death, mentions his partaking of the last sacraments from the\r\nBishop of Fossombrone, in these terms, \"Quiquidem Deos illi superos\r\natque manes placavit\"? Such idioms will not bear retranslation. The\r\nexpression employed by Castiglione, though tinged with the cold\r\nformality of classicism, is less startling: \"Ut ungeretur more sanctæ\r\nmatris ecclesiæ rogavit.\" But a pagan taint may often be sadly traced\r\nupon the devotion of this age. In the first volume of Vaissieux's\r\n_Archivio Storico d'Italia_, the last hours of a convict, condemned\r\nat Florence in 1500, are thus narrated by an eye-witness:--Pietro\r\nPaolo Boscoli, a political reformer of the school of Savonarola,\r\nthirsted in his dying moments after the living waters of evangelical\r\ntruth, and sought some better solace than the cold formalities of\r\nan ordinary _viaticum_. Refusing to be shriven by any but a friar\r\nof St. Mark's, he adjured an attendant friend to aid in getting\r\nBrutus out of his head, in order that he might make a Christian\r\nend. Nor was this heterodoxy exclusively Italian. Cervantes, in a\r\nrecently recovered fragment, _El Buscapié_, says, \"I dislike to see\r\nthe graceful and pious language befitting the Christian muse mingled\r\nwith the profane phraseology of heathenism. Who can be otherwise\r\nthan displeased to find the name of God, of the Holy Virgin, and\r\nof the Prophets, in conjunction with those of Apollo and Daphne,\r\nPan and Syrinx, Jupiter and Europa, Vulcan, Cupid, Venus, and\r\nMars?\"--_Bentley's Mag._, XXIV., p. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *59: He died, says the anonymous author of the _Diario_\r\ncited above (note *, p. 80), between the fourth and fifth hour of the\r\nnight, that is, between 10.30 and 11.30 p.m., and it was Tuesday. The\r\nnews came to Urbino on the 10th, so, according to the Anonimo, he\r\ndied on the 9th.]\r\n\r\nSince the Duke's departure to Fossombrone, his state had been\r\nadministered by the Duchess and Francesco Maria. The former, alive to\r\nthe duties committed to her, wrote thus to the priors of Urbino, when\r\nthe danger became imminent.\r\n\r\n     \"Worthy and well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"The illness of the most illustrious Duke our consort\r\n     having so increased that the physicians, though not\r\n     despairing, doubt of his recovery, we have thought fit,\r\n     by these presents, to exhort and charge you that you be\r\n     watchful and diligent in regard to whatever may occur,\r\n     so as to maintain the tranquillity of your citizens; who\r\n     having, in the recent unhappy times, ever maintained their\r\n     faith unshaken towards us and our said consort the Duke, we\r\n     desire that they shall, at the present juncture, persevere\r\n     in the like mind, whereby we may ascertain the worth of\r\n     those really deserving. At the same time, if, as we do\r\n     not believe, any riotous and ill-conducted persons should\r\n     attempt or plot any disorders, we have taken such steps\r\n     and means as must put down and chastise their insolence,\r\n     and leave them a signal example to others. And, as it is\r\n     necessary to provide against such a contingency, we desire\r\n     that you forthwith let this be understood in the most\r\n     fitting manner, it being our intention to maintain the\r\n     peace in this our well-beloved city.\r\n\r\n     \"From Fossombrone, 1508.\r\n\r\n     \"ELISABETTA GONZAGA, DUCISSA URBINI.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing from Ludovico Canossa that the Duke's illness approached\r\na fatal termination, Julius had, on the 13th, instructed Federigo\r\nFregoso to repair to Fossombrone with his own physician, Archangelo\r\nof Siena, and, after administering such aid and consolation as the\r\ncase might require, to take fit measures for insuring the quiet\r\nsuccession of Francesco Maria della Rovere in the dukedom, and for\r\nthe interim administration of affairs by the Duchess. But, ere they\r\narrived, mourning had succeeded to suspense, and their sympathies\r\nwere demanded for the widowed Duchess, who had passed two days\r\nsince her bereavement in utter despair, refusing food and sleep. So\r\nentirely, indeed, were the functions of life suspended, that for some\r\ntime it was feared the vital spark had followed its better half, and\r\nit was very long ere her ghastly and spectral form gradually resumed\r\nthe aspect of an existence in which all interest was for her gone\r\nby, and which, but for the representations of her friends, she would\r\nhave wished to quit.[*60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *60: Capilupi, whom Isabella d'Este had sent to Urbino,\r\ndescribes in a long letter the mourning and grief he found there.\r\nIt is too long to quote. Cf. LUZIO and RENIER, _Mantova e Urbino_\r\n(Torino, 1893), p. 185.]\r\n\r\nThe body was borne on shoulders to Urbino during the following night,\r\nsurrounded by multitudes carrying torches, their numbers swollen, as\r\nthey advanced, by influx of the country population through which the\r\nfuneral cortège passed. Castiglione, who accompanied it, describes\r\nthe night as one of mysterious dread, in which the wailing of the\r\npeople ever and anon was broken upon by piercing shrieks echoed\r\nfrom the mountains, and repeated by the distant howling of alarmed\r\nwatch-dogs. The inhabitants of the capital issued forth to meet the\r\nmelancholy procession, headed by their clergy, the monastic orders,\r\nand the confraternities. In the great hall of the palace the Duke\r\nlay in state, during two days, upon a magnificent catafalque with\r\nits usual but incongruous decorations of sable velvet, gold damask,\r\nand blazing lights. His dress is minutely described by the anonymous\r\ndiarist as consisting of a doublet of black damask over crimson hose,\r\na black velvet hat over a skull-cap of black taffetas fringed with\r\ngold, and black velvet slippers; to which was added the mantle of the\r\nGarter, in dark Alexandrine velvet, with a hood of crimson velvet,\r\nlined with white silk damask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _R. Tammé_\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF A LADY IN MOURNING\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Pordenone in the Dresden Gallery_]\r\n\r\nBut, with that strange blending of opposite feelings which marks\r\nthe visits of death to regal halls, the mourners were soon summoned\r\nfrom this vision of departed greatness to contribute far other\r\nhonours to its living representative. One day having been devoted\r\nto lament the general loss, the Lord Prefect, Francesco Maria,\r\nrepaired, with the principal authorities, to the cathedral, and,\r\nafter solemn mass, published the will, by which his uncle named him\r\nheir and successor to his states and dignities, nominating his widow\r\nto the regency during the nonage of his heir, and leaving her\r\nCastel Durante, with a provision of 14,000 ducats, besides her own\r\ndowry of 18,000. During the afternoon succeeding the proclamation of\r\nFrancesco Maria, he visited the Duchess, who was \"transfixed with\r\ngrief.\" He was accompanied by a small deputation of citizens, to\r\noffer their duty and condolence, and receive her tearful thanks for\r\nthe happy accomplishment of her husband's testamentary intentions,\r\nwith entreaties that they would transfer to his successor the loyal\r\naffection they had borne to their late sovereign. About four o'clock\r\na funeral service was performed in the great hall, from whence,\r\nat eight, the body was conducted by an again mournful host, to\r\nremain for the night in the church of Sta. Chiara. Next day it was\r\ntransported, during continual rain, to the Zoccolantine church, in\r\nthe groves around which he had been surprised by the first aggression\r\nof Cesare Borgia. In its small nave his remains were entombed\r\nopposite those of his father; and over both there were subsequently\r\nplaced two modest monuments in black and white marble, surmounted by\r\nbusts of the Dukes. The inscription to Guidobaldo is to this effect:\r\n\"To Guidobaldo, son of Federigo, third Duke of Urbino, who, emulating\r\neven in minority his father's fame, maintained his authority with\r\nmanly energy and success. In youth he triumphed over adverse fortune.\r\nVigorous in mind, although enfeebled by disease, he cultivated\r\nletters instead of arms; he protected men of general eminence instead\r\nof mere military adventurers; and he ameliorated the commonwealth by\r\nthe arts of peace, until his court became a model to all others. He\r\ndied in the year of God MDVIII., of his age XXXVI.\"\r\n\r\nThe solemn obsequies befitting sovereign personages, including six\r\nhundred masses, were performed on the 2nd of May in the cathedral,\r\nwhich was hung and carpeted with black, and illuminated with five\r\nhundred wax-lights. In the nave was an immense cenotaph, decorated\r\nwith representations of the most important events of the Duke's\r\nlife, his standards and insignia, with suitable legends, and on\r\nthe bier, in place of the body, lay his robes of the Garter. The\r\nfunction was attended by the court, five bishops, the clerical\r\ndignitaries, with deputies from all parts of the duchy, and most of\r\nthe Italian states, as well as the principal inhabitants. Before the\r\nelevation of the host, a funeral oration was recited by his former\r\npreceptor Odasio, in which the wonted wordiness of such compositions\r\nis redeemed by a certain fire of eloquence, mellowed by occasional\r\ntouches of fine sentiment, rendering it the best part of Bembo's\r\ncompilation regarding Guidobaldo. Its excellence, and the vast\r\nconcourse of spectators, estimated at ten thousand, contributed to\r\nmake this the most notable ceremony of the sort then remembered in\r\nItaly. On the following day, the oaths of allegiance to the new Duke\r\nwere taken, and his predecessor was consigned over to history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe character of the last Montefeltrian Duke need scarcely be told\r\nto those who have followed this sketch of his life. Gifted by nature\r\nwith talents of a very high order, he cultivated them in early youth\r\nwith an application rare indeed in his exalted rank, and a success\r\nwhich his marvellous memory tended alike to facilitate and to render\r\npermanent. In times singularly productive of military heroes and\r\nmen of letters, he emulated the celebrity of both, and, had health\r\npermitted him a prolonged and active career, he might, in the\r\never-recurring battle-fields of Italy, have equalled the renown left\r\nby his father and earned by his successor.\r\n\r\nWhen disabled from the profession of arms, he fell back with fresh\r\nzest upon his youthful studies, and drew around him men whose\r\nconverse harmonised with these tastes. To say that his learning\r\nwas unequalled among the princes of his day is no mean compliment.\r\nHis palace became the asylum of letters and arts, over which he\r\ngracefully presided. Aldus Manutius, in dedicating to him editions\r\nof Thucydides and Xenophon, addressed him in Greek, of which he was\r\nso perfect a master as to converse in it with ease. To the latter of\r\nthese historians the Duke was very partial, calling him the siren of\r\nAttica. Among his other favourite classics, Castiglione names Lucian,\r\nDemosthenes, and Plutarch; Livy, Tacitus, Quintus Curtius, Pliny,\r\nand the Orations of Cicero. Most of these he knew intimately, and\r\nrecited entire passages without reference to the book. But besides\r\nthese selected authors, he is said to have made himself acquainted\r\nwith almost every branch of human knowledge then explored. Nor were\r\nreligious studies omitted. The history, rites, and dogmas of the\r\nChurch are mentioned among the topics familiar to his versatile\r\ngenius; St. Chrysostom and St. Basil were among his chosen books. To\r\nenumerate all the contemporary authors who shared his patronage might\r\nbe irksome, but we shall introduce one letter addressed by him to\r\nPaolo Cortesio.\r\n\r\n     \"Most reverend and well-beloved Father in Christ:\r\n\r\n     \"I have received your letter, with your Treatise on\r\n     the dignity of Cardinal, which, being full of noble\r\n     matter gracefully and eloquently handled, has been most\r\n     acceptable, and I have looked over it with much pleasure. I\r\n     therefore offer you my best thanks for it, and for having\r\n     mentioned me in that work; and if I can do anything for\r\n     you, let me know it, that I may have an opportunity of\r\n     showing my gratitude for your merits and your services in\r\n     my behalf. In October next I mean, God willing, to return\r\n     to Rome, and I shall hold myself prompt to forward your\r\n     interests there, or wherever else I may chance to be.\r\n     Urbino, 18th of June, 1506.\r\n\r\n     \"GUIDO UBALDO, DUKE OF URBINO, and Captain-General\r\n     of the Holy Roman Church.\"[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Bibl. Magliab. Class. viii., No. 68, p. 132.]\r\n\r\nThe great endowments he thus admirably developed were united\r\nwith a disposition represented as nearly perfect, at all events\r\nas exempted from the failings most perilous to princes. The bad\r\npassions which opportunity and indulgence have, in all ages,\r\nrendered peculiarly fatal to those whose will is law, were almost\r\nstrangers to his breast. Prone to no vicious indulgences, he was\r\never kind and considerate, as well as just and clement. He may, in\r\nshort, be regarded as that rarest of all characters, an unselfish\r\ndespot,--despot as regarded the possession of absolute power, but not\r\nso in its use. The nobility had nothing to dread from his jealousy\r\nor his licentiousness; the citizens were spared oppressive imposts;\r\nthe poor looked up to him as a sympathising protector. In short, we\r\nmay pronounce him a magnanimous, a most accomplished, and, so far as\r\nerring man is permitted to judge, a blameless prince.\r\n\r\nNor was the impression left upon the public mind by the glories of\r\nUrbino under Guidobaldo of a transient character. Mocenigo, Venetian\r\nenvoy at the court of his grand-nephew, thus speaks of him above\r\nsixty years after his death:--\"Disabled by broken health from active\r\npursuits, he fell upon the project of forming a most brilliant court,\r\nfilled with eminent men of every profession; and by rendering himself\r\ngenerally popular, with the co-operation of his Duchess, who emulated\r\nhim in welcoming and entertaining persons of talent, he brought\r\naround him a greater number of fine spirits than any sovereign had\r\nhitherto been able to attract, and, indeed, gave to all other princes\r\nin the world the model and example of an admirably regulated court.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nS.

The\r\ncompliment paid to her character, in that author's sketch of the\r\nUrbino sovereigns, bears upon it a stamp of truthful earnestness\r\nrarely found in his rhetorical periods.[62]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: \"Itaque multas sæpè feminas vidi, audivi etiàm esse\r\nplures, quæ certarum omninò virtutum, optimarum quidem illarum atque\r\nclarissimarum, sed tamèn perpaucarum splendore illustrarentur: in\r\nquâ verò omnes collectæ conjunctæque virtutes conspicerentur, hæc\r\nuna extitit, cujus omninò parem atque similem aut etiam inferiorem\r\npaulò, non modò non vidi ullam, sed ea ubi esset etiàm ne audivi\r\nquidem.\"--Bembo de Guidobaldo.]\r\n\r\nAn anonymous and now lost complimentary poem, written about 1512,\r\nand formerly in the library of S.

The terms of affection with which\r\nshe regarded her husband's adopted heir underwent no change after\r\nher bereavement; and his marriage to her niece Leonora Gonzaga\r\nstrengthened the tie.

At Urbino\r\nin particular, their progress was then great, their influence\r\nproverbial; and our next eight chapters will contain notices of them\r\nwhich would have interrupted the continuity of our previous narrative.\r\n\r\nThe reigns of Dukes Federigo and Guidobaldo I. extended over a\r\nperiod which general consent has regarded as the most brilliant in\r\nItalian history, and which we have repeatedly named its golden age.\r\nHigh expectations are naturally entertained of literature, arts,\r\nand general refinement in a cycle of such pretension. We look for\r\na rapid advance of thought in paths of learning and science whence\r\nduring long centuries it had been excluded. We anticipate a widely\r\ndisseminated zeal for classic writers, an eager rivalry to outstrip\r\nthem in branches of speculative knowledge, which they especially\r\ncultivated. We imagine the imitative arts revived under the influence\r\nof new and more exquisite standards. And we reckon upon the diffusion\r\nof a taste and capacity for enjoying those things among classes\r\nhitherto excluded from such intellectual enjoyments. In each of these\r\nexpectations the student of literary history will be gratified; yet\r\nthere are several sorts of composition which, if separately examined,\r\noffer disappointing results, and scarcely a single work written\r\nduring the fifteenth century has maintained universal popularity. The\r\nexplanation is easy. This age was one of unprecedented intellectual\r\nactivity, when men's minds were devoted to the acquisition of\r\nknowledge which they had laboriously to hunt out, and doubtingly to\r\ndecipher. They had to cut for themselves tracks through an unexplored\r\nregion, without grammars or commentaries to serve them as guides and\r\nlandmarks. The toilsome habits thus formed were forthwith exercised\r\nfor the benefit of subsequent investigators, and were applied to\r\nsmoothing the path which they had themselves penetrated. Thus\r\nwas it that the first successful scholars became grammarians and\r\ncommentators. Surrounded by ample stores of intelligence, they had\r\nno occasion to cultivate new germs of thought. Their first object\r\nwas to secure and render accessible the treasures which antiquity\r\nhad unfolded to them; their next, to elaborate them in varied forms,\r\nto reproduce them in the manner most congenial to their intellectual\r\nwants. Thus they became more industrious than original, laborious\r\nrather than creative. Again, those who, on entering the garden of\r\nknowledge, thought of its fruits rather than of its approaches,\r\ninstead of seeking the reward of their toils among the fair mazes of\r\npoetry and belles lettres, aimed at more arduous rewards, and climbed\r\nthe loftiest and most slippery branches in search of golden apples.\r\nThe harvest of scholastic philosophy which they thus gathered in\r\nmay seem scarcely worthy of the fatigues given to its acquisition;\r\nbut from the seeds so obtained, cultivated and matured as they have\r\nbeen by many after labourers, a copious and healthful store of\r\nintellectual food has been secured for subsequent generations. The\r\nwork performed by these pioneers of learning and truth was, however,\r\nmore calculated to crush than to inspire that more elastic fancy\r\nwhich preferred the flowery mead to the tree of knowledge. The spirit\r\nof the age was ponderous and prosaic, and the few who attempted to\r\nrise above its denser atmosphere into poetic regions were clogged by\r\nthe trammels of a dead language, and by obsolete associations which\r\nthey dared not shake off. The fifteenth century was consequently rich\r\nin scholars, copious in pedants, but poor in genius, and barren of\r\nstrong thinkers.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances necessarily detract from the popular interest of\r\nItalian literary history at this important period, all influential\r\nto its after destinies, and we mention them in the conviction that\r\ngeneral readers must feel disappointed with this portion of our\r\nwork. The vast mass of materials then created now reposes in the\r\nprincipal storehouses of learning, much of it unpublished, and but\r\na small part rendered accessible in recent editions. As it would\r\nbe an unprofitable task to labour upon these materials for merely\r\ncritical purposes, we have for the most part satisfied ourselves with\r\nan examination of the authors immediately connected with Urbino; nor\r\nshall we be tempted much beyond that narrow limit, by the facility\r\nof borrowing from those copious and intelligent writers who have\r\nsuccessfully investigated the intellectual progress of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe revival of civilisation, and its handmaid arts, is a problem\r\nso inexplicable on the ordinary principles which regulate human\r\nprogress,[64]--its causes were so complex, and many of them so\r\nremote, and singly so little striking,--that it were, perhaps,\r\nvain to hope for a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon. It\r\nmay be, that the ever revolving cycle of human affairs had brought\r\nround a period predestined to intellectual development, or that mind,\r\nawakening from the slumber of centuries, possessed the energies of\r\nrenewed youth. But in a season of universal and sudden progress it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish between cause and effect,--to decide whether\r\nmind aroused liberty, or if freedom was the nurse of intelligence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *64: The secret is not far to seek, but it was inexplicably\r\nhidden from men in Dennistoun's day. The continuity of life and\r\nof art the most sensitive expression of life, is understood and\r\nacknowledged by too few among us; but that there is an historical\r\ncontinuity in art as in life would be easy to prove, since no part\r\ncan be adequately grasped or explained save in relation to the whole.\r\nOf course, as Renan admitted, history has its sad days, but all\r\nare, as it were, a part of the year which would be incomplete and\r\ninexplicable without them. Thus there is no gulf fixed between the\r\nart of Greece and the art of the Middle Age or the Renaissance; each\r\nis an inevitable part of the whole, and the later was what it was\r\nbecause of the old. Burckhardt, one of the greatest students of our\r\ntime, seems to have understood this also with his usual happiness.\r\nM. Auguste Gerard tells us in his notice of the life of its author,\r\nwhich serves as a Preface to the French edition of _Le Cicerone_,\r\nthat \"Burckhardt en vrai disciple de la Renaissance considérait\r\nl'Italie comme un tout continu; et dans l'histoire de l'art de même\r\nque dans l'énumération des oeuvres, il ne séparait pas l'Italie\r\nantique de l'Italie moderne. La section du _Cicerone_ qui était\r\ndédiée à l'architecture commençait aux temples de Paestum pour\r\nfinir aux villas Napolitaines et Génoises des XVIIe et XVIIIe\r\nsiècles.\" In that idea lies the future of all criticism.]\r\n\r\nThe feeble hold which the popes retained over their temporal\r\npower during their residence at Avignon, and during the great\r\nschism, promoted the independence of the ecclesiastical cities,\r\nmany of which then passed under the dominion of domestic tyrants,\r\nor assumed the privileges of self-government. In either case the\r\nresult was favourable to an expansion of the human mind. The sway\r\nof the seigneurs, being based on no such aristocratic machinery\r\nas supported the fabric of feudalism, threw fewer obstructions in\r\nthe way of individual merit. The popular communities could only\r\nexist by a diffusion of political and legislative capacity, and\r\nthe commercial enterprises to which they in general devoted their\r\nenergies increased at once the demand for public spirit and its\r\nproduction. Even those intestine revolutions to which democracies\r\nwere especially subject contributed largely to the same end; for,\r\nalthough in such convulsions the dregs of the populace often rise to\r\nthe surface, talent, when backed by energy and daring, there finds\r\nextraordinary opportunities for display. Indeed, the multiplication\r\nof commonwealths, under whatever form of government, tended, in\r\na country situated as the Italian Peninsula then was, to the\r\ndevelopment of intellect. Defended by the Alps and the sea from\r\ninvasion, their physical and intellectual advantages constituted\r\nan influence which supplied the want of union and nationality. They\r\nthus could safely pursue their individual aims, and even indulge\r\nin rivalry and contests which, though perilous to a less favoured\r\npeople, were for them incentives to a praiseworthy and patriotic\r\nexertion. Whilst the separate existence of these petty states was\r\ncalculated to promote both political science and mental culture, it\r\nrendered the one subservient to the advantage of the other, and, in\r\nthe multitude of official and diplomatic employments, literary men\r\nfound at once useful occupation and honourable independence. Nor was\r\nthis result limited to one form of government. If the tempest-tossed\r\ndemocracy of Florence shone the brightest star in the Italian galaxy,\r\nthe stern oligarchy of Venice shed an almost equal lustre in some\r\nbranches of letters and art; and, on the other hand, the not less\r\npopular institutions of Pisa, Siena, and Lucca emitted but feeble\r\nand irregular coruscations. So also in the despotic states, whilst\r\nliterature was ever cherished under the ducal dynasty of Urbino, and\r\nwhilst it was favoured at intervals by the Sforza and Malatesta,\r\nthe d'Este and Gonzaga, and by the Aragonese sovereigns of Naples,\r\nits genial influence was unknown in some other petty courts. Again,\r\nif we turn to the papal throne, we shall find the accomplished\r\nNicolas, Pius, Sixtus, Julius, and Leo, sitting alternately with the\r\nBoeotian Calixtus, Paul, Innocent, and Alexander. From an impartial\r\nreview of Italian mediæval history it appears that democratic\r\ninstitutions were by no means indispensable to the expansion of\r\ngenius, since the progress of letters and arts was upon the whole\r\nnearly equal in the republics and the seigneuries, under the tyranny\r\nof a condottiere or the domination of a faction.[*65]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *65: Far from being indispensable, the democratic\r\ninstitutions had very little to do with the progress of the arts\r\nwhich were fostered by individuals, whether in a tyranny such as\r\nUrbino or in a so-called republic such as Florence.]\r\n\r\nBut, before entering upon the proper subject of this chapter, it may\r\nbe well briefly to consider the influence which the petty princes\r\nof Italy exercised upon the revival and cultivation of letters and\r\narts. The dominion of these chiefs, though hereditary in name, was in\r\ngeneral maintained, as it had been gained, by the sword. To them, as\r\nto the savage, arms were an instinctive pursuit, warfare a primary\r\noccupation. For their frequent intervals of truce (and in no other\r\nsense was peace known to them), their circumscribed sovereignty\r\ngave little occupation. Domestic polity was still an undeveloped\r\nscience, and their leisure fell to be spent upon intellectual\r\nobjects, or in grovelling debaucheries. The number who preferred\r\nthe nobler alternative is very remarkable, when compared with the\r\nlike class in other parts of Europe. During the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries literature was cultivated and art was encouraged\r\nby a large proportion of the sovereigns and feudatories of Italy,\r\nwhen the bravest condottieri were often their most liberal patrons.\r\nSuch were the impetuous Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, the gallant\r\nFrancesco Sforza, the treacherous Ludovico il Moro; whilst the\r\nGonzaga of Mantua, and the d'Este of Ferrara, but most especially\r\nthe ducal houses of Urbino, extended, during successive generations,\r\nan enlightened and almost regal protection to genius of every\r\nshade. Nothing akin to this is to be found in the republics. Siena,\r\nPisa, and Lucca produced many great artists, but literature found\r\nin them neither a cradle nor an asylum. The commercial communities\r\nof Venice and Genoa belonged to an entirely different category of\r\ncircumstances; and Florence, though an exception to our remark, owed\r\nits pre-eminence not less perhaps to the patronage of the Medici than\r\nto an unparalleled prevalence of talent and public spirit among its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIn times when the popular will, if not the source of power, was\r\nits best support, it became the interest of the dominant prince\r\nor party so to use authority as to please and flatter the masses;\r\nto cloak their own usurpations by throwing a lustre around their\r\nadministration, and to preserve the confidence of their subjects by\r\ninstitutions calculated to promote the national glory. In this way\r\nindividual talent might be stimulated, and public civilisation might\r\nadvance, even whilst freedom was on the decline; and, as the means\r\ncommanded by the seigneurs were ample, they could patronise genius,\r\nand surround their courts with literary retainers, who in democratic\r\ncommunities were left to their own resources. Thus the Sforza and the\r\nd'Este, even the savage Malatesta of Rimini, befriended genius, which\r\nfound no haven in the republics of Genoa and Lucca, and, the fashion\r\nhaving once been established among their princely houses, letters\r\nwere cultivated by not a few of these soldiers of fortune, but more\r\nespecially by the ladies of their families.\r\n\r\nThese unquestionable facts are met by an allegation that the\r\nfountains of princely patronage were so tainted, their streams so\r\ngenerally corrupt, as to blight the fruits which they seemed to\r\nfoster, and that their influence thus from a blessing became a curse.\r\nLet us examine a little the grounds for this assertion, for surely it\r\nis not by such sweeping and prejudiced denunciations that we shall\r\narrive at truth. As to the ornamental arts, there cannot be a doubt\r\nthat these received, throughout Italy, from governments of every\r\nform, as well as from numberless corporations and individuals, a\r\nhearty encouragement which might well shame our degenerate age. Yet\r\nthe ducal palace at Urbino, the Palazzo del T at Mantua, the tombs\r\nof the Scaligers, and the medallions of Malatesta, yield the palm to\r\nno republican works of the same class. It was by Cosimo and Lorenzo\r\nde' Medici, and by Duke Federigo di Montefeltro, that the undeveloped\r\nenergies of new-born science, and the long neglected classics of\r\nGreece and Rome were nursed and tended through their years of\r\ninfancy, which storms of faction, in most of the free states,\r\ncondemned to neglect. The enlightened liberality of these princes,\r\nand of Malatesta Novello, founded libraries for the preservation of\r\nworks composed under their own beneficent encouragement, as well\r\nas of manuscripts collected by them from all quarters at immense\r\ncost, and this when no republic but Venice aspired to such literary\r\ndistinctions. Nor were the troubled waters of democratic strife\r\nsafe for the poet's gay bark and light canvas. Even Dante, though\r\nmade of sternest stuff, sought shelter in a courtly harbour from\r\nthe hurricanes of Florentine faction. It is true that, in many\r\ncompositions of minstrels trained in princely halls, the themes\r\nare ephemeral and the epithets overstrained, savouring, to a purer\r\ntaste and more severe idiom, of unworthy subserviency; nor is the\r\nother polite literature, emanating from the same atmosphere, exempt\r\nfrom similar blemishes. But allowance must be made for the seducing\r\nfecundity of the language in superlatives, more redolent of dulcet\r\nsounds than of definite signification, a quality which has ever\r\ntempted Italian mediocrity to assume the borrowed plumes of poesy,\r\nand to conceal its native barrenness under magniloquent but flimsy\r\ncommon-places. The well earned gratitude of authors is fittingly paid\r\nin compliments, eulogies, or dedications, and as such coin is at the\r\nunlimited command of the debtor, and useful only to the receiver, its\r\nover-issue is fairly excusable. This results from principles inherent\r\nin human nature, and it matters little whether the obligations have\r\nbeen incurred from sovereigns or from subjects, under an autocrat or\r\na democracy. Even among ourselves, in times when talent had more to\r\nhope from private patronage than from extended popularity, a similar\r\ncurrency was scarcely less in vogue, and it was only the poverty of\r\nour idiom that kept its circulation within bounds. Hence, were the\r\nindependence of the best English writers of a century or two ago to\r\nbe estimated from their dedicatory addresses, or their occasional\r\nodes, a condemnation as unreasonable as sweeping would go forth\r\nagainst names long inscribed in our temple of fame. This argument\r\nmight easily be extended; but enough has been said to show that\r\nmore was done for the support of letters under princely than under\r\npopular institutions, and that the adulatory epithets natural to the\r\nlanguage, and inherent in the usages of Italy, are no certain index\r\nof base subserviency.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, independent sovereignty, irrespective of\r\npolitical forms, was of primary importance to the encouragement\r\nof mental cultivation. The separation of Italy into a multitude\r\nof petty states converted almost every town into a capital, which\r\nits rulers and its citizens took equal pride in decorating. The\r\npatriotism thus generated was intense in proportion to the narrow\r\nfield on which it was exercised, and an expenditure, restrained by\r\nsevere sumptuary restrictions, found scope on monuments honourable\r\nto the public. Thus there ensued, between hostile communities and\r\nemulous factions, a rivalry in arts as in arms, whereby public\r\ninstitutions prospered, and individual genius was encouraged. Fanes,\r\nwhose glories seem to defy the waste of time, were thus raised for\r\nthe devotional requirements of the people; palaces grew up the\r\nbulwark of their liberties; citadels were fortified to rivet their\r\nchains; and even when the ultimate results were fatal to freedom,\r\nthe talent and activity thus stimulated were sure to eventuate in\r\nindustrial progress, as well as in the restoration of letters and the\r\nimprovement of art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe human mind, when aroused from its long and leaden slumbers, at\r\nfirst instinctively leaned for support upon such vestiges of ancient\r\nlearning as had survived the wreck of ages. To excavate and examine\r\nthese was the laborious task assumed by early students, in which\r\nPetrarch and Boccaccio sedulously joined. But, justly appreciating\r\nthem as materials on which to found a new fabric, rather than as\r\nthe substitutes for original thought, \"the all-Etruscan three\"\r\nhappily combined enthusiasm for classic models with the power to\r\nrival them in a language simultaneously matured by themselves for\r\nthe daring undertaking. The fifteenth century arrived; it was an\r\nepoch of reaction; one of other tendencies and tastes, when genius,\r\nas Ginguené has happily observed, was superseded by erudition.\r\nEntering the path which Petrarch had partially explored, its\r\npioneers neglected the better portion of his example. They spent\r\ntheir energies in rummaging obscure recesses of monastic libraries,\r\nand wasted time and learning in transcribing, collating, and\r\nannotating the various manuscripts which thus fell within their\r\ngrasp. In exhuming and renovating these monuments of a long-buried\r\nliterature, they were forgetful of the fact that their dealings were\r\nwith dead corpses; and whilst submitting the recovered fragments to\r\nphilological analysis, they perversely sought to embody their own\r\nsouls in these decayed members. As such materials were incapable\r\nof being reanimated, or even remodelled into more apt forms,\r\nthis unnatural union was seldom effected without violence to the\r\nsentiment. Even the ablest writers devoted themselves to the arid\r\ntask of scholia and translations, composing in the dead tongues\r\nsuch original works as they attempted. The result was a monstrous\r\nmetempsychosis, whereby thought, enchained in uncongenial bodies,\r\nlost its due influence, and appeared in, at best, an unseemly\r\nmasquerade. Hence the language of the century was Latin, its manner\r\npedantic, its spirit coldly artificial.\r\n\r\nBut whilst the historian of that age laments the shackles thus\r\nimposed upon its literature, it were unjust to withhold from it\r\nthe merit of preserving those treasures of ancient history and\r\nphilosophy, eloquence and poetry, which, under happier auspices and\r\nmore judicious treatment, have elevated thought, enlarged intellect,\r\nand enriched the style of later times. Although unable to refine\r\nthe true metal from its dross, the pedants of \"fourteen hundred\"\r\nwere miners who discovered the precious ore, and ascertained its\r\ncomponent ingredients. The fashionable ardour for collecting early\r\nMSS. of ancient authors was very generally accompanied with untiring\r\nperseverance in mastering their intricacies. Philology and grammar\r\nthus grew into sciences, and their professors held the keys of human\r\nerudition. Deep ought to be our gratitude for the contingent of\r\nclassical literature rescued from a rapid destruction by such arduous\r\nand self-denying labours; and a history of these discoveries, and\r\nof the zeal and enterprise volunteered by the early commentators\r\nand publishers of the ancient authors, would form an interesting\r\nmonument of undaunted and generally successful diligence. Yet,\r\nin a comprehensive view of the results springing from these new\r\ntendencies, it is impossible to blind ourselves to the evils that\r\nemanated from them. From the nerve, grandeur, and elegance of Greek\r\nand Roman writers, there was much to learn with advantage; but their\r\ninfluence was directly antagonist to the highest sentiments of a\r\nChristian, and, in the main, a devotional people. When tried by such\r\na test, their philosophy was hollow, their heroism selfish, their\r\nrefinement corrupted. Nor was it only by reproducing the themes and\r\nthe philosophy of distant ages that classicism clogged the elasticity\r\nof reviving literature. By inculcating extinct languages as the\r\nonly means fitted for expressing their ideas, Italian literati\r\nchecked the progress of their vernacular tongue,--that best bulwark\r\nof nationality,--and at the same time impeded the free expansion\r\nof thought, which, thus conducted into artificial channels, could\r\nbut stagnate or freeze. The mind, habituated to find in literature\r\na restraint, came to regard natural feeling as a solecism, living\r\nimages as incongruous anomalies, warmth of sentiment as a blemish\r\nsedulously to be avoided. Under such false training, knowledge\r\nreceived the impress of a languid conventionality; and even those who\r\ncondescended to write in Italian, chilled their compositions with\r\nthe pedantry of antique idioms. The classic style thus introduced\r\nhad many inherent defects. Borrowed plumage is seldom becoming, and\r\nservile imitations are always bad. Besides, the ancient type had been\r\noriginally modelled by a people, and in an age, little sympathetic\r\nwith those for whom it was now reproduced, and whose sentiments were\r\ncramped equally by the conventionalisms of an obsolete manner, or\r\nby the adoption of a dead tongue. Hence is it that the fifteenth\r\ncentury, so signalised by the diffusion of knowledge, and the advance\r\nof the fine arts, has bequeathed to us fewer eminent writers than\r\nthose which immediately preceded and followed it, and that during its\r\ncourse Italian literature was unquestionably retrograde.\r\n\r\nThis is especially true of poetry, in an age of erudition when\r\nlearning was essentially prosaic. The collation of manuscripts,\r\nthe construction of grammars, the mastering of idioms, the revived\r\nsubtleties of Greek dialectics, were ponderous studies with which the\r\ntaste for literature of a lighter and more elastic tendency could ill\r\nassimilate. The chords whence Dante had evoked majestic notes, that\r\nseemed to swell from higher spheres, lay silent and unstrung; the\r\nlyre of Petrarch was left in feebler hands.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only evil resulting from an excess of the classical\r\nmania. Languages in which Christianity had not been naturalised\r\nwere ill adapted for the expression of revealed truth; and the new\r\nscholarship, discarding the barbarisms of monastic Latin, imported\r\ninto theological as well as profane compositions, the phrases of\r\na pagan age. To find the personages of the Trinity, or even the\r\nhagiology of Rome, familiarly discussed under mythological names, is\r\nto us merely absurd and revolting;[*66] but when men, already imbued\r\nwith classical predilections, were accustomed to mix up in words the\r\nobjects of their worship with the demigods of their admiration, the\r\nnatural consequence was a confusion of ideas nowise favourable to the\r\nmaintenance of their faith or the purity of their morals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *66: Neither absurd nor revolting, I think, since, a little\r\nfantastically certainly, but very truly none the less, it expresses\r\nthat continuity of the religious sense in Europe which is perhaps the\r\none eternal thing to be found in it. If the saints are not in a very\r\nreal sense the gods in exile, they are excellent imitations of them.]\r\n\r\nA not less prejudicial element emanated from the revived philosophies\r\nof Greece, which now arrested attention and divided the speculations\r\nof learned men. That derived from Aristotle, and known to Europe\r\nthrough the sages of Arabia, had long occupied the cloisters, where\r\nalone mind was then exercised, or its operations studied. The rival\r\nsystem of Plato came directly from its native soil; and was first\r\npublicly taught in Italy early in the fifteenth century, by Gemistus\r\nPlato,[*67] of Constantinople. It attracted the notice of Cosimo\r\nPATER PATRIÆ, who after having Marsilio Ficino, son of his\r\nphysician, grounded in its mysteries by Greeks of learning, placed\r\nhim at the head of an academy in Florence, instituted by himself\r\nfor the dissemination of its doctrines. From thence these radiated,\r\nabsorbing the attention of literary men, and enlisting many converts\r\nfrom the Stagirite faith. Aristotle and Plato became the watchwords\r\nof contending sects,[*68] and the usual jarring results of such\r\nlogomachy were not long wanting. The merits of a question, at first\r\nexaggerated by its respective zealots, were lost sight of in the\r\ntorrent of abuse which gradually superseded argument, and inflamed\r\nevery evil passion. Far overleaping the legitimate limits or literary\r\nwarfare, disputant logicians advanced from replies to libels, from\r\nwords to blows, and, after exhausting the armoury of invective,\r\nhad recourse to the dagger. But on a subject so painful we are not\r\ncalled to enter. Backed by the authority of Nicholas V., the zeal\r\nof Cardinal Bessarion, and the example of the Medici, the sublime\r\nand imaginative speculations of Platonism for a time prevailed over\r\nthe more material system of the Stagirite, and Florence became their\r\nhead-quarters. The human mind, unaided by revelation, has never\r\ninvented any system so abstractly beautiful, so pure in its morals,\r\nso elevating in its conceptions, so harmonious in its conclusions.\r\nIts lofty ethics rank next to the doctrines of inspiration, for it\r\ntaught that happiness is the natural result of virtue, and that\r\nthe mischiefs entailed by the passions are ill repaid by their\r\ntransient pleasures. Yet, though thus intrinsically calculated to\r\nennoble and refine the heart of fallen man, the Platonic theories\r\nindirectly led to lamentable results, both to the religion and the\r\nmorality of the age. The divine revelation was by them virtually\r\nsuperseded, and paganism, from an affectation, became a conviction,\r\nor, at the least, a prevailing fashion, warping the manners and\r\nphrases, the faith and spirit of the age. Men lived for the present\r\nworld by the light of human reason, until they forgot or denied a\r\nfuture existence, and a holier wisdom. The first blow struck at this\r\npractical heathenism came from Paul II., a Venetian, who was behind\r\nthe age in its knowledge, as well as in its extravagances, and who\r\nrelentlessly persecuted what he had not the capacity to redargue.\r\nMind was, however, no longer to be silenced by papal bulls, or\r\ntrammelled by penal fetters: it regarded the use of such weapons as\r\nproof that the spiritual armoury contained none more serviceable, and\r\nlearned to demur to an ecclesiastical despotism it already loathed.\r\nSucceeding pontiffs disavowed the policy of Paul: but the old respect\r\nfor the papacy was shaken; doubts arrayed themselves against dogmas,\r\ncavilling superseded blind faith, until the dissolute example set\r\nby the courts of Innocent, Alexander, and Leo, converted scepticism\r\ninto infidelity, apathy into open aggression. It is impossible to\r\ncontemplate the great talents, the unwearied application, absorbed by\r\nthese rival systems of philosophy, without a sigh that they should\r\nhave been wasted on inquiries so purely speculative; yet, it cannot\r\nbe denied that the controversy prepared weapons that have since\r\ndone good service in many a better cause; that it developed mental\r\nenergies, and matured intellectual discipline, from which the world\r\ncontinues largely to benefit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *67: Not Plato, but Plethon. He refused the name of Plato\r\nwith which he was hailed by Cosimo de' Medici. Cf. Ficino in preface\r\nto his _Plotini Epitome_ (Firenze, 1492). \"Magnus Cosimus, quo\r\ntempore concilium inter Graecos et Latinos, sub Eugenio pontefice\r\nFlorentinæ tractabatur, philosophum Graecum, nomine Gemistum\r\ncognomine Plethonem, quasi Platonem alterum de mysteriis Platonicis\r\ndisputantem frequenter audivit; e cujus ore ferventi sic afflatus\r\nest protinus, sic animatus, ut inde Academiam quandam alta mente\r\nconceperit, hanc opportuno primum tempore pariturus.\" Marsilio Ficino\r\nhad a poor understanding of Plato.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *68: Cf. GEORGIOS TRAPEZUNTIOS, _Comparatio\r\nPlatonis et Aristotelis_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the revival of letters had been advancing during several\r\ngenerations ere the chiefs of Montefeltro sought other laurels than\r\nthose of the battle-field, it was reserved for these princes to\r\ncontribute no mean aids towards their full development in that golden\r\nharvest which the fifteenth century saw gathered in. Indeed, the\r\nconcurrent testimony of all writers has claimed for the sovereigns of\r\nUrbino a foremost place among the friends of literature. In the words\r\nof the general motto of this work, which well condense the prevailing\r\nopinion, \"it is notorious beyond question even of the malignant, that\r\nthe house of Montefeltro and della Rovere has for a long time past\r\nbeen that which [most] shed a lustre upon Italy by letters, arms, and\r\nevery sort of rare worth, and that the court of Urbino may be termed\r\na Pegasean spring, in the language of historic truth rather than of\r\npoetic hyperbole.\" It was to the successive reigns of Dukes Federigo\r\nand Guidobaldo I. that such expressions were generally applied, and\r\nto them our attention will now be directed; but in a future portion\r\nof this work we shall endeavour to maintain for their della Rovere\r\nsuccessors a similar reputation.\r\n\r\nWere we to estimate the celebrities of Urbino by the encomiums of\r\ntheir partial countrymen, and measure their claims upon mundane\r\nimmortality by the standard set up by Baldi Lazzari, Grossi,\r\nCimarelli, and Olivieri, it would become our indispensable duty\r\nto add at least a volume to the present work. But these authors\r\nwere deeply imbued with that peculiarly Italian patriotism which,\r\nnarrowing its sympathies within the limits of a township or a petty\r\nstate, enshrined provincial mediocrity in a temple of fame modelled\r\nupon a scale of national splendour. Believing that the dignity of\r\ntheir little fatherland depended upon the notices of its existence\r\nwhich they could worm out of antique memorials, however doubtful in\r\nauthority, and upon the number of notable names they could connect\r\nwith its localities, they tasked themselves to this investigation\r\nwith industry worthy of a nobler and more useful object. Many folio\r\nvolumes, ponderous in their contents as in their material, were\r\nthe result; but they preserve only laborious trifling, a harvest\r\nof wordy conclusions gleaned from a soil barren of tangible facts,\r\ndissertations which may be summed up in the axiom _ex nihilo\r\nnihil fit_, \"nothing comes of nought.\" Like those of the northern\r\nsenachies, their themes were often legendary or invented, and it\r\nwould have been scarcely a loss to literature had these productions\r\nbeen equally fugitive. Should the worthies mentioned in the following\r\nchapters seem scarcely to maintain the literary renown of Urbino, our\r\nreaders ought in justice to remember that scarcely a tithe has found\r\nplace in our pages of those whom zealous eulogists have placed upon\r\nthe roll of Italian literati, but\r\n\r\n                     \"Whose obscurer name\r\n     No proud historian's page will chronicle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n     Count Guidantonio a patron of learned men--Duke\r\n     Federigo--The _Assorditi_ Academy--Dedications to\r\n     him--Prose writers of Urbino--Gentile Becci, Bishop of\r\n     Arezzo--Francesco Venturini--Berni of Gubbio--Polydoro di\r\n     Vergilio--Vespasiano Filippi--Castiglione--Bembo--Learned\r\n     ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reputation long enjoyed by the house of Montefeltro as patrons of\r\nletters and arts can scarcely be traced further back than Federigo,\r\nsecond Duke of Urbino. Yet the few memorials that remain of his\r\nfather, Count Guidantonio, throw some scattered lights upon congenial\r\ntastes, and from these we select three letters to the magistracy of\r\nSiena, which are preserved in the Archivio Diplomatico of that city.\r\nThe first of them is written in Latin, the others in Italian.\r\n\r\n     \"To the mighty and potent Lords the well beloved Fathers,\r\n     the Lords Priors, Governors, and Captain of the people of\r\n     the city of Siena.\r\n\r\n     \"Mighty and potent Lords, my especial Fathers,\r\n\r\n     \"After the expression of my sincere affection: I\r\n     understand that your Magnificences are about to agree\r\n     upon a commendable work, that of endeavouring to amend\r\n     the course of legal and other educational studies in your\r\n     city: what is really laudable needs no verbose exposition,\r\n     the fact being of itself clear and manifest. I have here\r\n     my compeer the excellent Doctor Benedetto di Bresis of\r\n     Perugia, a man of great integrity, who, without gainsaying\r\n     any one, sets forth the law in that city more amply than\r\n     any of the other judges who expound it there, and whom\r\n     his sacred Majesty lately invited to undertake the office\r\n     of captain of Aquila, on the recommendation of his own\r\n     merits, a charge which he has hitherto declined only from\r\n     an unwillingness to interrupt those studies to which he\r\n     is primarily devoted. I, however, hesitate not to propose\r\n     him as well qualified for your Magnificences, induced by a\r\n     twofold motive; first, that he may be able to continue his\r\n     studies; secondly, that he may escape from the contagion\r\n     of a home now struck by the pestilence; thirdly, that\r\n     through me you may have the honour of securing for your\r\n     course of study so able a doctor. I therefore heartily\r\n     entreat your Magnificences, and again pray and beseech\r\n     you, to appoint him to your lectureship of civil law with\r\n     an adequate salary, as a singular pleasure to myself, and\r\n     as a compliment to him, whose ample qualifications must\r\n     be satisfactory to the free wishes of your community and\r\n     the judges. And should he now or in future fall short of\r\n     these recommendations, which I cannot suppose (for I am not\r\n     so stupid), I shall consider your Magnificences to have\r\n     received at my hands a disgrace and injury, entitling you\r\n     in reason and justice to complain of me, after having so\r\n     received him into your service; and I shall always continue\r\n     beyond measure obnoxious to you and your city. Ever ready\r\n     to do you all service; from Urbino, 1st of August, 1412.\r\n\r\n     \"COUNT GUIDANTONIO OF MONTEFELTRO AND URBINO.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Mighty and potent Lords, dearest Fathers:\r\n\r\n     \"The worthy and skilful Messer Piero di Pergolotti of\r\n     Verona is repairing to your magnificent Lordships, who\r\n     for a good while has been at Pesaro, where he practised\r\n     surgery, conducting himself with propriety and diligence,\r\n     so that the lords of that place and myself feel much\r\n     obliged to him, and consider ourselves bound to promote\r\n     his knowledge by providing him with the means of study.\r\n     He earnestly desires to enter into your establishment\r\n     of the Sapienza, where he hopes to do credit to this\r\n     recommendation, as well as to advance his own honour and\r\n     advantage.

From Cagli, the 24th of December, 1441.\r\n\r\n     \"GUIDANTONIO, COUNT OF MONTEFELTRO, URBINO, AND\r\n     DURANTE.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the traits of literary taste displayed by Duke Federigo, we\r\nlearn from his biographer Muzio, that it was his custom to repair\r\nweekly to the Franciscan convent, and to encourage among its learned\r\nsociety debates and discussions on subjects analogous to their\r\nstudies. Upon this somewhat loose foundation, he has been claimed\r\nas founder of the _Assorditi_, and it has been ranked among the\r\nearliest academies in Italy. We need not pause to investigate\r\ntheir respective titles to honours so questionable, now that such\r\nassociations are generally recognised as prolific of two enormous\r\nliterary nuisances, pedantry and puerility. From their antipathic\r\ncontact genius long has fled, leaving the field open to triumphant\r\nmediocrity. Pretending to no original efforts, it was their narrow\r\naim to imitate standard productions, or to ring the changes upon them\r\nin prosing and pointless commentaries. To indite two tomes of scholia\r\non a sonnet of Petrarch was the dreary task that qualified for\r\nadmission into the Florentine Academy; to string Platonic nothings\r\ninto rhyme was the high ambition which numbered votaries by hundreds.\r\nThe _Assorditi_ were no exception from the usual category of\r\nmediocrity; and whether they were first associated under Federigo's\r\nprotection, or, as Tiraboschi alleges, sprang into existence under\r\nGuidobaldo II., is of little moment to the literary history of Urbino.\r\n\r\nIn times when letters flourished chiefly at courts, patronage was\r\nthe grand end of authorship, every work being inscribed to at least\r\none high personage. The character and position of Federigo subjected\r\nhim to a large share of such incense; but among the many dedications\r\nlaid at his feet none perhaps was more fulsome, and at the same time\r\nmore ingenious, than that prefixed by Marsilio Ficino to his Latin\r\nversion of Plato's _Essay on Monarchy_. It narrates that Jupiter,\r\nwilling to found on earth a model sovereignty, resolved to send down\r\nthe beau-ideal of a ruler for its guidance. He, therefore, summoned\r\nthe gods in full convocation, and presented to them his new creation,\r\nunder the title _Fideregum Orbinatem Ducem_, which may be literally\r\ninterpreted \"Royal faith, ruler of the world,\" but which was\r\ncorrupted by human idiom into _Federigo Urbinate Duce_. Pallas and\r\nMercury thereupon, in presence of Truth, endowed the new prince with\r\ncrown and sceptre; and the Academy, as a humble handmaid of these\r\ndeities, inscribed to him Plato's work upon mundane sovereignty.\r\nAlthough we have had occasion to notice in our tenth chapter this\r\nDuke's taste for the graver studies of theology, philosophy, history,\r\nand Grecian literature, and to commemorate the fruit it produced in a\r\nvariety of other dedications, yet few who distinguished themselves in\r\nthese pursuits are sufficiently identified with Urbino to authorise\r\nour dwelling at any length upon their names. Guarino of Verona,\r\nPoggio Bracciolini, Donato Acciaiolo, Poliziano, and others of mark,\r\nmay therefore be omitted; and we shall thus have very few prose\r\nauthors to bring before our readers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENTILE DE' BECCI was probably a native of Urbino, but the\r\ninterest attaching to his name is owing rather to the distinction\r\nattained by his pupils than to his own. He was selected by Pietro\r\nde' Medici to train up his son Lorenzo the Magnificent; and to have\r\neducated such a mind is an unexceptionable title to fame. Yet the\r\nChristian philanthropist who sighs over the dross which mingled\r\nwith its ore, the impure uses to which its bright metal was in some\r\nrespects misdirected, by a master who might have moulded it to\r\nholier purposes, and might have enriched by its talents the treasury\r\nof truth and the triumphs of religion, may well hesitate ere he\r\ngrants to the preceptor of Lorenzo a reflected share of his glory,\r\nwithout also holding him responsible for that pagan epicureanism\r\nwhich spread like a pestilence from the Medicean court throughout\r\nItaly. Nor do the notices remaining of Becci tend to nullify such\r\nan inference. The favour of his patrons naturally obtaining for him\r\nrapid promotion, he was raised to the see of Arezzo in 1473. But\r\nhis life was that of a statesman rather than that of a good pastor.\r\nWe read of his tact as a diplomatist, his skill in public affairs,\r\nhis dexterous civil administration of his diocese, by directing\r\ntowards commercial industry energies which had wasted themselves on\r\nfaction; we are assured that his popularity was confirmed by his\r\nencouragement of liberal arts, by his mild and courteous character;\r\nwe are told that in political science his pen was ably employed. But\r\nregarding his theological attainments, the purity of his morals, the\r\nzeal of his clerical ministrations, his eulogists are silent. We may\r\nadd that to him Guicciardini in some degree imputes the miscarriage\r\nof the proposed league of Italy against the French invasion in\r\n1492, in consequence of his personal ambition, when sent to conduct\r\nthe negotiations at Rome on the part of the Medici, whilst his\r\nthoughtless extravagance there wasted resources of the Florentines\r\nwhich might have been better spent on military preparations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf LUDOVICO ODASIO it is unnecessary to add anything to what\r\nwe have already had occasion to say.[69] FRANCESCO VENTURINI\r\nof Urbino is reputed the first after the revival who wrote a complete\r\nLatin grammar. It was dedicated to Count Ottaviano Ubaldini, and\r\nwas printed at Florence in 1482, and again in his native town by\r\nHenry of Cologne, in 1493-4.[70] Among his pupils he is said to have\r\nnumbered both Raffaele and Michael Angelo.[*71] Besides BERNI\r\nDA GUBBIO, whose Diary has been edited in the Scriptores of\r\nMuratori, there were several annotators of events in their native\r\nduchy, whose prose writings remain in the Vatican Library, and have\r\nsupplied us with useful information; but they were not historians,\r\nand it is unnecessary to bring them forth from their obscurity. Of\r\none name, however, we may make an exception.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: See vol. I., p. 297. His oration on the death of\r\nFederigo is No. 1233 of the Vat. Urb. MSS.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Maestro Arrigo, of Cologne, _alias_ Heinrich v. Coln,\r\nhad then a press at Urbino. The typographic art had been introduced\r\nthere about 1481, and at Cagli five years earlier by Roberto da Fano\r\nand Bernardino da Bergamo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *71: Francesco da Urbino, who was certainly Michelangelo's\r\nschoolmaster, does not seem to be the same as his friend Francesco\r\nUrbino, so touchingly spoken of in the following letter from\r\nMichelangelo to Vasari:--\r\n\r\n     \"Messer Giorgio, Dear Friend,--Although I write but badly,\r\n     yet will I say a few words in reply to yours. You know that\r\n     Urbino is dead, for which I owe the greatest thanks to God;\r\n     at the same time my loss is heavy and sorrow infinite. The\r\n     grace is this, that while Urbino living kept me alive, in\r\n     dying he has taught me to die not unwillingly but rather\r\n     with a desire for death. I had him with me twenty-six\r\n     years, and always found him faithful and true. Now that I\r\n     had made him rich and thought to keep him on the staff and\r\n     rest of my old age he has departed, and the only hope left\r\n     me is that of seeing him again in Paradise, and of this God\r\n     has given a sign in his most happy death. Even more than\r\n     dying, it grieved him to leave me alive in this treacherous\r\n     world, with so many troubles; the better part of me went\r\n     with him, nothing is left to me but endless sorrow. I\r\n     commend myself to you....\r\n\r\n     \"Your MICHAEL ANGELO BUONARROTI, in Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"The 23 day of February, 1556.\"\r\n\r\nSee Le Lettere, No. CDLXXV., p. 539, in Brit.

His relation, Adrian Castellesi, who, when\r\nCardinal of Corneto, was well known both in England and at Rome,[72]\r\nhad been sent by Innocent VIII. as legate to Scotland, but remained\r\nat London in consequence of the death of James III. at the battle of\r\nStirling. There he was joined by Polydoro, who, on taking priest's\r\norders, had, through his influence, obtained from Alexander VI. the\r\ncollectorship of an old house-tax in England called _Romescot_, or\r\nPeter's pence, originally imposed in Saxon times for the maintenance\r\nof English pilgrims to Rome. Aliens being there frequently objects\r\nof church preferment, he, in 1503, obtained the rectory of Church\r\nLangton in Leicestershire; and, on his patron's appointment in the\r\nfollowing year to the see of Bath and Wells, the path of further\r\npromotion was opened to him. In 1507 he became prebendary of Lincoln\r\nand of Hereford, and archdeacon of Wells, on which he resigned his\r\ncollectorship. In 1515 he shared an imprisonment in the Tower,\r\nbrought upon Adrian by the jealousy of Wolsey, whose haughty spirit,\r\ndisappointed of the purple, attributed the delayed honours to the\r\nBishop's influence. Letters were consequently written by Sadoleto\r\nin Leo's name to the English court on behalf of Polydoro, and\r\nWolsey having received the much coveted scarlet hat, there was no\r\nfurther pretext for his detention. The date of his return home is\r\nvariously stated at 1534 or 1550, and he carried from Henry VIII. a\r\nrecommendation which procured him letters of nobility from his own\r\nsovereign. His literary talents being probably somewhat overrated in\r\nItaly, the long residence he made in the hotbed of heresy, without\r\nexercising his pen in defence of his Church, appears to have brought\r\nthe purity of his faith under suspicion. That there was no tangible\r\nground for the imputation may be presumed from his spending the rest\r\nof his life unquestioned at Urbino, where he died in 1555, and was\r\nburied in the Duomo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Many curious unedited particulars regarding him, with\r\nreference to the conspiracy against Leo X. in 1517, of which he was\r\nsuspected, are contained in Sanuto's Diaries, but we have not space\r\nto notice them.]\r\n\r\nThe favour which Vergilio obtained in Adrian's eyes was partly\r\nowing to his success in cultivating the niceties of the Latin\r\ntongue, to restore which in its purity was a favourite project of\r\nthe Cardinal. Before quitting Italy he had dedicated to Guidobaldo\r\nI. his _Proverbiorum Libellus_, a volume scarcely meriting the\r\ncontroversy upon which he entered with Erasmus as to the priority\r\nof suggesting such a collection. In 1499 he finished his treatise\r\n_De Inventoribus Rerum_, which was placed in the index of prohibited\r\nworks, in consequence of tracing certain liturgical observances back\r\nto pagan superstitions; Grossi, however, vindicates his orthodoxy\r\nby ascribing the obnoxious passages to heretical interpolation. His\r\nessay _De Prodigiis_ is an attempt to explain upon natural principles\r\nall omens, auguries, and other superstitious observances. As it is\r\ninscribed to Duke Francesco Maria I., he probably returned to Italy\r\nbefore 1538.\r\n\r\nBut what chiefly interests us is a Latin _History of England_,\r\nwhich he is said to have undertaken at the suggestion of Henry\r\nVII., or more probably of Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester, who\r\nprocured him access to certain archives. This work, from being the\r\nfirst general compilation of the sort given to the public, obtained\r\nmore consideration than its superficial and inaccurate matter\r\ndeserved; and Mr. Roscoe well observes that it has not gained the\r\nsuffrages of posterity, either by ability or freedom from bias.\r\nAmong the impugners of its veracity are Whear, Humphrey Lloyd,\r\nHenry Savile, and Bishop Bale. Some of these excuse his blunders\r\non the questionable plea of his ignorance of English government,\r\ndialects, and manners, while Leland regrets that a writer so little\r\ntrustworthy should have cast over his deceptions the graces of style.\r\nAnticipating perhaps such an aspersion, he, in his dedication of\r\nthe work to Henry VIII., dated from London in 1530, compared the\r\nchronicles of Bede and Gildas, crude in form and phraseology, to\r\nmeat served without the salt which it was his object to supply. Yet\r\nwhile the English blame him for misrepresentations,--avenged in the\r\nstinging Latin epigram,\r\n\r\n     \"Maro and Polydore bore Virgil's name;\r\n     One reaps a poet's, one a liar's fame,\"--\r\n\r\nGiovio cites the testimony of French and Scotch authors to his\r\npartiality for the land of his adoption. More serious, but\r\nunestablished, is a charge greatly resented by his countrymen, that,\r\nafter garbling records and ancient muniments thrown open to his\r\nexamination, he consummated the outrage by destroying the evidence of\r\nhis villainy. It may, however, be well to keep in view that, although\r\nBale claims him as a willing reformer of certain Romish abuses, his\r\nadherence to that Church brought on him distrust of the Protestants,\r\nin an age when theological disputes were matter affecting life and\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nIn the Vatican is preserved a MS. of this history in two volumes\r\nfolio, of 1210 pages, in twenty-five books, ending with the death\r\nof James IV. of Scotland in 1512. The narrative is preceded by a\r\ndedication in Latin to Francesco Maria II., from Antonio Vergilio\r\nBattiferri, grand-nephew of the author, which is dated in 1613, and\r\nmentions the MS. as autograph. Yet on the last leaf is this colophon,\r\napparently in the same hand: \"Rogo ut bene conserventur, simul cum\r\naliis in cenobio venerand. monalium Sce. Clare de Urbino, quousque\r\nbella, Deo favente, cessabunt. Ego Federicus Ludovici Veterani\r\nUrbinus scripsi totum opus.\" But though not the original, that\r\ntranscriber's name guarantees the accuracy of this copy. An extract\r\nfrom it in II. of the Appendix proves that the Leyden edition of 1651\r\nis in fact a loose paraphrase of the work.[73]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: The MS. is No. 497-8 of the Vat. Urb. MSS.

He was thus in familiar intercourse\r\nnot only with the literary men of the age, but with such princes\r\nand prelates as turned their attention to the promotion of reviving\r\nletters by multiplication and preservation of books. Of many such\r\nhe has left us biographical notices, recently given to the world\r\nby Cardinal Mai from three MSS. in the Vatican library,[75] and in\r\nthe Riccardiana of Florence. His collection of lives of illustrious\r\nladies remains unedited. In the former work no memoir is so fully\r\nextended as that of Duke Federigo of Urbino, upon which we have in\r\npart drawn in our Second Book. It was inscribed to Duke Guidobaldo\r\nI., in a dedication which not only testifies to his father's martial\r\nskill, and a prowess that never knew defeat, but also to the prudence\r\nof his sway, and assures us that the great powers of Italy had\r\nfrequent recourse to his judicious counsels. Unlike the pedantic\r\nwriters among whom he lived, Vespasiano composed these memoirs in\r\nthe language of the people for whose information he intended them;\r\nbut the long interval that elapsed before they saw the light has\r\nnecessarily prevented them from becoming in any degree popular.\r\nMuratori, though unable to give an account of their author, has\r\nprinted his lives of Eugene IV. and Nicholas V., and characterises\r\nhis style as possessing a simplicity more precious than eloquence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *74: For Vespasiano da Bisticci, consult (1) his own\r\ncharming and exquisite work, _Vite degli uomini Illustri_ (Firenze,\r\n1859), with an excellent preface by Bartoli; FRATI, _Lettere_ (Bologna,\r\n1892-93). ROSSI writes of these in _Giornale Stor. d. Lett. Ital._\r\n(1892), vol. XX., p. 258, and vol. XXIV., p. 276.

Urb.\r\nMSS. 941.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo members only of the brilliant and lettered court of\r\nGuidobaldo have gained enduring celebrity from their\r\nwritings--CASTIGLIONE and BEMBO.[*76] The former\r\nmay be considered a pattern of gentlemanly writing, the latter of\r\nscholarlike composition. We have already said what is necessary\r\nof both, and have introduced into our narrative an idea of Count\r\nBaldassare's _Cortegiano_, its objects and style. It is said to\r\nhave been suggested by Louis XII., and written about 1516, but\r\nthe author's preface seems to point at an earlier date. Two of\r\nhis published letters to Bembo show how anxiously he awaited the\r\nsuffrage of his friends, among whom it was handed about; but it was\r\nsent to press in 1528, only in consequence of the alarm of a pirated\r\nedition being in preparation, from a MS. which had been submitted\r\nto the famed Vittoria Colonna, Marchioness of Pescara. The number\r\nof reprints which issued during the next fifty years was at least\r\nforty-two. A variety of circumstances conduced to this extensive and\r\ncontinued popularity. Books professing to initiate the many into\r\nhabits and mysteries of refined society ever have claims on public\r\ncuriosity, but the attraction was here increased by the dazzling\r\nreputation of the palace-circle at Urbino, as well as by the charms\r\nof erudition, wit, elegance, and worldly wisdom which sparkle in\r\nevery page. It has, however, been remarked that most translations of\r\nthe _Cortegiano_ have failed to obtain the applause bestowed upon the\r\noriginal. The observation may be taken as a compliment to the polish\r\nof its diction, and to those delicacies of expression that bear no\r\ntransplanting into another idiom. It also proves that the celebrity\r\nof this work rests much upon its style. The subject could scarcely\r\nbe treated at such length without falling into that diffuseness and\r\nrepetition, which, though clothed in beauty by the rich fluency of\r\nthe Italian language, must always degenerate into monotony when\r\nrendered by the bold expletives of a less copious tongue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *76: For Castiglione, see works mentioned in note *2,\r\np. 51 _supra_. I understand Mrs. Ady has written a biography of\r\nCastiglione, which is shortly to appear. For Bembo, I cite here\r\na few works more especially relating to Urbino or to his general\r\nlife: MORSOLIN, _Pietro Bembo e Lucrezia Borgia_, in _Nuova\r\nAutologia_, August, 1885. Cf. CIAN, in _Giornale Stor. d. Lett.\r\nItal._, XXIX., p. 425. CIAN, _Un decennio della vita di P. Bembo_\r\n(1521-31) (Torino, 1885), and LUZIO, in _Giornale St. d. Lett. Ital._,\r\nVI., p. 270, and D'ANCONA, _Studi sulla Letteratura de' primi secoli_\r\n(Ancona, 1884), p. 151 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTIGLIONE\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Raphael in the Louvre_]\r\n\r\nIn a period when princes and courts little resembled what they have\r\nsince become, we possess from the pens of Machiavelli and Castiglione\r\ngeneralised portraits of both; and they may be relied on as genuine,\r\nalthough the Tuscan, like the _tenebristi_ painters, overloaded his\r\ndarker shadows, whilst the Mantuan Count employed the roseate tinting\r\nof licensed flattery. Roscoe considers the _Cortegiano_ an ethical\r\ntreatise, yet it belongs as much to belles-lettres as to moral\r\nphilosophy. Its author has been called the Chesterfield of Italy,\r\nand the parallel is singularly apt. The Count and the Earl have each\r\nsupplied \"a glass of fashion and a mould of form\" for the guidance of\r\ntheir courtly contemporaries, and the posthumous reputation of both\r\nwith the world at large rests more upon their dicta as arbiters of\r\npoliteness, than upon their rare diplomatic address and statesmanlike\r\nattainments. With all its interest as a picture of manners and a test\r\nof civilisation in that proverbially refined age, with every charm\r\nwhich elegance of style can impart, it is impossible to dwell on the\r\n_Cortegiano_ without feeling that its influence was then fraught with\r\nevil. In the pages of that essay were first systematically embodied\r\nprecepts of tact, lessons of adulation, all repugnant to the stern\r\nmanners and wholesome independence of antecedent generations. The\r\nhomely bearing of honest burghers, the rough and ready speech of men\r\nwho lived in harness, were there put out of fashion by studied phrase\r\nand cringing flattery, too easy preparations for the effeminate\r\neuphuism and fulsome servility which Spanish thraldom soon after\r\nimposed upon Italy.\r\n\r\nAnother work of Castiglione, to which we have already had occasion to\r\nrefer, is his letter, written in Latin, to Henry VIII., containing\r\nan account of Guidobaldo's death, with a somewhat meagre sketch of\r\nhis character. But there is in its composition an air of effort, a\r\nstraining at rhetorical effect, which leave upon us the inevitable\r\nconclusion that he thought more of his style than his hero. These\r\nfaults and deficiencies belong, however, in a still greater degree\r\nto that more ambitious disquisition, wherein Bembo has sought to\r\nhonour the memory of the Duke and Duchess, whose favour he had amply\r\nenjoyed. His few fugitive poems well merit the preference accorded to\r\nthem by Tiraboschi over most contemporary effusions, from force of\r\nsentiment not less than felicitous expression. It would be difficult\r\nto rival in the literature of any age the pathos of that ode wherein\r\nhis beloved wife is supposed to sigh over his prolonged absence, and\r\nsend him the sympathetic yearnings of her long-suppressed affection.\r\nOf this, however, and his Tirsis, we have already said enough.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: See above, pp. 49-50, 53-4, 58.]\r\n\r\nThe courtly qualities of Count Baldassare are acknowledged wherever\r\nhis native literature is known; that they were not inconsistent with\r\nhis observance of parental feelings is proved by an interesting\r\nLatin letter addressed to his children the year before his death,\r\nwhich has been preserved by Negrini in his _Elogii Historici_ of the\r\nCastiglione family.\r\n\r\n     \"To my beloved children, Camillo, Anna, and Ippolita.\r\n\r\n     \"It is my belief, dearest son Camillo, that you, above\r\n     all things, desire my return home, for nature and the\r\n     laws equally inculcate veneration for our parents next to\r\n     God; and in your case there may be a special duty, since\r\n     I, content with but one boy, would not have another to\r\n     share with you my property and parental affection. That I\r\n     may not have to repent of such a resolution, I shall own\r\n     myself free of doubt as to yourself; yet would I have you\r\n     aware that I look for such duty at your hands rather as a\r\n     debt, than with the indifference of most parents. It will\r\n     be easily paid, if you regard in the light of a father\r\n     that excellent preceptor obtained by your friends, and\r\n     implicitly follow his advice. From my prolonged absence,\r\n     I have nothing to inculcate upon you beyond this line of\r\n     Virgil, which I may without ostentation quote:\r\n\r\n          \"From me, my son, learn worth and honest toil;\r\n          Fortune from others take.\"[78]\r\n\r\n     \"And do you, Anna, who first endeared to me a daughter's\r\n     name, so perfect yourself in moral graces, that whatever\r\n     beauty your person may develop, shall be the handmaid of\r\n     your virtues, and shall figure last in the compliments\r\n     paid you. And you, Ippolita, reflect on my love for her\r\n     whose name you bear; and how charming it would be for your\r\n     merits to surpass your sister's as much as her years do\r\n     yours. Go on both, as you are doing, and, having lost the\r\n     mother who bore you before you could know her to be so, do\r\n     you imitate her qualities, that all may remark how greatly\r\n     you resemble her. Adieu.\r\n\r\n     \"From Monzoni, the 13th July, 1528.\r\n\r\n     \"Your father,\r\n\r\n     \"BALTHASSAR CASTILION.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78:\r\n\r\n     \"Disce, puer, virtutem ex me, verumque laborem;\r\n     Fortunam ex aliis.\"\r\n\r\n     _Æneid_ XII., 345.\r\n\r\nDryden has missed the point of this passage.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe position which BEMBO holds in the literature of Italy's\r\ngolden age is not less singular than prominent. As an historian and\r\npoet, a philologist and rhetorician, and as a voluminous writer of\r\nofficial and private letters, he challenges criticism and has gained\r\napplause. It is, however, as a reformer of style that his claims\r\nhave been most freely accorded, and his example held up to general\r\nimitation. Following the fashion of his day, he regarded classical,\r\nand especially Latin, attainments, as the attribute most needful for\r\nan accomplished man. But he went further; and, aware of the coarse\r\nand rugged manner into which literature had fallen, sought to correct\r\nLatin composition, and to perfect his own tongue, after the purest\r\nancient standards. On this object he spared no pains, till by long\r\nand laborious practice he wrote in both with equal precision. He is\r\nsaid to have subjected each of his works to forty separate critical\r\nrevisions, and no one can read a page without feeling that, as with\r\ntoo many of his countrymen, the manner has occupied quite as much\r\nthought as the matter. This naturally tended to an opposite extreme,\r\nfor the studied structure of his sentences, and the fatiguing\r\nrecurrence of mythological allusion, are blemishes greatly detracting\r\nfrom the pleasure afforded by his works.[79] Scaliger, accordingly,\r\nhas scourged his pagan misnomers of divine things, while his\r\n\"childish heresy\" of abject Ciceronian imitation is ridiculed by\r\nLansius and Lipsius. Yet there is justice in the test applied to\r\nthem by Tiraboschi; for great and wide-spread evils require extreme\r\nremedies, and the prevailing laxity of style having been once\r\nbrought into discredit by his example, those who followed were able\r\nto avail themselves of his guidance and taste, without falling into\r\nthe rigidity and constraint which blemish his compositions. Indeed,\r\nnotwithstanding these obvious blots, which hero-worship has mistaken\r\nfor beauties, his History of Venice, his Essay on Imitation, his\r\ndiplomatic and familiar correspondence, and even his poetry, must,\r\nwhen tried by then-received standards, be allowed a merit entitling\r\nthem to the general suffrage of contemporaries. It is to his Latin\r\nprose that our strictures are most applicable. Forgetting, in his\r\nzealous imitation of Cicero, the allowance due to modern themes,\r\nprinciples, and feelings, he so slavishly followed that heathen\r\nphilosopher's idioms, as to clothe what he meant for Christianity\r\nin the words of paganism. Even his letters, running in name of the\r\nsuccessor of St. Peter, transmuted the Almighty into a pantheistic\r\ngenerality, our Saviour into a hero, and the Madonna into a goddess\r\nof Loreto. It may be feared that this latitudinarianism was not\r\nlimited to manner, for an anecdote alleges him to have seriously\r\nrecommended a young divine to avoid reading St. Paul's Epistles, lest\r\nthey might mar his style.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: \"Quid autem ineptius quam, toto seculo renovato,\r\nreligione, imperiis, magistratibus, locorum vocabulis, ædificiis,\r\ncultu, moribus, non aliter audire, loqui, quam locutus est\r\nCicero? Si revivisceret ipse Cicero, rideret hoc Ciceronianorum\r\ngenus.\"--ERASMUS.]\r\n\r\nCompositions conceived and executed in so eclectic a spirit could\r\nscarcely avoid falling into coldness and pedantry; and such are\r\nprominent faults in his Venetian history, and his tribute to Duke\r\nGuidobaldo,--two works especially connected with the subject of\r\nthese pages. The former is the most important production of his pen,\r\nand was begun in 1529, by desire of the Signory, in continuation of\r\nSabellico's narrative, It is comprised in twelve books, extending\r\nfrom 1487 to 1513, where it remained unfinished at his death, but\r\nwas continued by Paruta. From a contemporary possessing talent,\r\nindustry, leisure, and high literary reputation, as well as many\r\nopportunities of personal observation, very large expectations might\r\nbe legitimately entertained. But as a churchman, he is said to have\r\nbeen jealously excluded from the Venetian archives, a condition\r\nwhich, in the judgment of Tiraboschi, ought to have disqualified\r\nhim from the task, and which may account for, if it cannot excuse,\r\nthe superficial character of the narrative, the poverty of graphic\r\ndetails, and the teasing absence of dates. On the composition, too,\r\nhis classic mania has left its withering traces. It was his ambition\r\nhere to rival the Commentaries of Cæsar; and, in perfecting the\r\nidiom of a dead language, he has constrained freedom of thought, and\r\npolished away the life and spirit of his theme. We have examined his\r\npages, as an indispensable authority upon events which occupy several\r\nchapters of our work; but those who read Italian history for pleasure\r\nwill generally prefer to do so either in the Italian tongue or their\r\nown. Conscious probably of this, the author himself translated the\r\nwork into his vernacular language, and both versions were published\r\nsoon after his death.\r\n\r\nHis dissertation on the characters of the Duke and Duchess of\r\nUrbino is written in Latin, and exhibits all those blemishes of\r\nstyle to which we have just referred, and which so strangely jar\r\nupon the fulsome flattery and elaborate verbiage which he labours\r\nto reduce into Ciceronian terseness. Though entitled a \"Book,\" the\r\nwhole occupies but a hundred pages in the octavo edition of his\r\nworks (1567), whereof scarcely one third is original matter. It is\r\naddressed to Nicolò Tiepolo, a literary gentleman of Venice, and\r\nprofesses to have been committed to writing for the satisfaction\r\nof some Venetians who, feeling an interest in Guidobaldo as their\r\nformer guest, had applied to the father of Bembo for some account of\r\nhis death. It is thrown into a dialogue between himself, Sadoleto,\r\nFilippo Beroaldo the younger, and Sigismondo [Conti?] of Foligno.\r\nThe last-named personage supplies to their inquiries a narrative\r\nof the Duke's closing hours, addressed to Julius II., by Federigo\r\nFregoso, along with the funeral oration pronounced at his obsequies\r\nby his preceptor Odasio. The former of these is written in a strain\r\nbeseeming a heathen philosopher, rather than a Christian dignitary;\r\nthe latter, which Tiraboschi has detected as very different from the\r\nprinted oration, is to the full as turgid and tiresome as are most\r\nsuch efforts of Italian adulation; neither of them tell anything of\r\nimportance that Castiglione has not better given us.\r\n\r\nThe whole discourse is, as I have had occasion to mention,[80] of\r\nbut trifling value to the biographer of these personages. Facts\r\nare generalised until no substance remains; incidents and traits\r\nof character are lost in the multiplicity of epithets; and thus we\r\nhave, instead of a speaking likeness, a vague and showy picture,\r\noverladen with ornaments until individuality is gone. The warmer\r\nemotions of the heart could scarcely, perhaps, be happily clothed in\r\nthe abstractions of a dead tongue, unadapted to the times, and to\r\ncircumstances which required the outpourings of unaffected grief;\r\nat all events, these measured periods and studied phrases give no\r\nreal pleasure. Bembo was an elegant Latinist, but in such a work the\r\nlanguage of nature could alone afford satisfaction. When we seek\r\nto know the true characters of his distinguished patrons, we are\r\ndismissed with an inflated rhetorical exercise; we are offered bread,\r\nand find it a stone. These strictures apply to the long funeral\r\noration, but still more to the dull didactic discourse of the four\r\nfriends, which wants the fire and feeling of the eulogy, and is\r\nsoiled by gross details gratuitously introduced on a point at which\r\ngood taste would have barely glanced. In all respects, the most\r\ninteresting portion of the work is Fregoso's letter, upon which we\r\nhave drawn in describing the death-bed of Guidobaldo. On the whole,\r\nthis production may be dismissed with a doubt whether its prosiness\r\nor its pruriency is most offensive. Nor will the perusal of those\r\npapal brieves, extended by the same writer, which despoiled of his\r\ninheritance the Duke's adopted child, blasphemously ejecting him from\r\nthe pale of Christendom, give a higher opinion of the sincerity of\r\nthis ungrateful sycophant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Vol. I., p. 298, 392; II., 114.]\r\n\r\nHis other works, having no immediate reference to our subject,\r\nmay be dismissed with few words. _The Prose_, a treatise upon\r\nrhetoric, intended to fix the standard of pure Italian composition,\r\nis a dialogue, to which Giuliano de' Medici and Federigo Fregoso\r\nare parties. _Gli Asolani_, a more juvenile production, was named\r\nfrom the castle of Asolo, at which some youths are represented as\r\ndiscussing the tender passion in all its moods and modifications.\r\nThis theme, notwithstanding the tedious manner in which it is\r\ntreated, gave it great popularity over western Europe in the\r\nsixteenth century, but the style and substance alike render it\r\nunpalatable to modern amateurs of light reading. His Latin treatise\r\n_De Imitatione_ is a dull defence of his Ciceronian mannerisms;\r\nhis essay in the same language upon Virgil and Terence a laboured\r\nphilological critique; his _De Ætna Liber_ a report of physical\r\nobservations during an early residence near that volcano. His poetry,\r\nboth Latin and Italian, enjoyed high reputation at a period when\r\nimitations of Petrarch had degenerated into common-place; for he\r\nsucceeded in brushing away the rust of ages, and restoring much\r\nof the bright polish peculiar to the bard of Arqua. Lastly, his\r\nvery numerous private and official letters have preserved to us a\r\nvaluable store of facts, and much curious illustration of coeval\r\nmanners and individual character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe share of laborious learning voluntarily borne by ladies of\r\nthe highest birth in the fifteenth century is a singular problem.\r\nThere was scarcely a sovereign family that could not boast among\r\nits daughters some votary of intellectual pursuits, in an age when\r\nmental cultivation was of a sort more calculated to overburden\r\ngenius, than to give wings to fancy in her flight after knowledge.\r\nA familiar acquaintance with Latin was then requisite, being the\r\nkey to modern as well as classic and biblical literature, and also\r\nthe current language of diplomacy or courtly intercourse.[*81] The\r\nabstruse distinctions of ancient philosophy, the complex tenets of\r\ndogmatic theology, the fatiguing jargon of scholastic disputation,\r\nwere all included in the circle of female accomplishments. Such were\r\nthe graces for which Bianca d'Este, Isotta Nogarolo, and Veronica\r\nGambara were famed; while another Isotta, paramour of the truculent\r\nLord of Rimini, divided contemporary adulation between the beauties\r\nof her person and her mind. The vagueness of such eulogies might\r\nwell justify scepticism as to the profundity of that lore they\r\nwere intended to vaunt; but in the case of Ippolita Maria Sforza,\r\ndaughter of Francesco Duke of Milan, and wife of Alfonso King of\r\nNaples, chance has afforded us a standard of the knowledge mastered\r\nby these learned ladies. It was for this princess that Constantine\r\nLascaris composed the earliest Greek Grammar; and in the convent\r\nlibrary of Sta. Croce at Rome there is a transcript by her of\r\nCicero De Senectute, followed by a juvenile collection of Latin\r\napophthegms curiously indicative of her character and studies. The\r\nhouse of Montefeltro could boast a full share of such distinction,\r\nin Princess Battista, wife of the wretched Galeazzo Lord of Pesaro,\r\nto whose literary celebrity we have elsewhere paid our tribute,\r\nand whose progeny we have seen maintaining the prestige of her\r\naccomplishments to the third generation. Her great-granddaughter\r\nBattista Sforza rivalled her accomplishments, and those of her cousin\r\nIppolita Maria, and, when placed by her marriage at the head of the\r\ncourt at Urbino, contributed much to the literary reputation which\r\nit then first obtained. Its two succeeding duchesses of the Gonzaga\r\nrace, although women of remarkable talent, did not carry so far the\r\ncultivation of their natural powers; but we have found, in their\r\nrelative and associate Emilia Pia, one whose learning was scarcely\r\nless notable than her wit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *81: On the whole subject of women, see note *1, p.\r\n72. Their education was the same as that of their brothers. Cf.\r\nSYMONDS, _The Renaissance in Italy_ (1904), vol. V., p.\r\n250, note 1, and BURCKHARDT, _The Civilisation of the\r\nRenaissance_ (1878), vol. II., p. 161.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the examples of female genius which emanated from the\r\ncourts of Italy, and, spreading to her universities, installed\r\nfeminine erudition in professorial chairs. Nor was this questionable\r\npractice limited within the Italian peninsula. Many Spanish dames\r\nwere conspicuous in scholarship, and, at the close of the century,\r\nSalamanca and Alcala saw their professorships held with applause by\r\nladies equally distinguished for birth and accomplishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n     Poetry under the Montefeltri--Sonnets--The\r\n     Filelfi--Giovanni Sanzi--Porcellio Pandonio--Angelo\r\n     Galli--Federigo Veterani--Urbani Urbinate--Antonio\r\n     Rustico--Naldio--Improvisatori--Bernardo Accolti--Serafino\r\n     d'Aquila--Agostino Staccoli--Early comedies--_La\r\n     Calandra_--Corruption of morals--Social position of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere the lettered court of Duke Federigo to be judged by its\r\nminstrels, a harsh sentence might perhaps be awarded. Nor would this\r\nbe quite fair. Their cold and common-place ideas, their rude and\r\nvapid verses, are indeed far beneath the standard of our fastidious\r\nage, and scarcely repay those who decipher them in venerable\r\nparchments. Yet have we ample evidence of their superiority to many\r\npoetasters of Italy, who then emulated Virgil's hexameters, or abused\r\nthe facilities of their vernacular versification; and it is just the\r\nfact of these laureates of Urbino so long surviving the countless\r\nrhymers of other principalities, that proves the discriminating\r\npatronage of a sovereign, who attached to his court the best writers\r\nof his time. Nor must we fail to remember that the now prominent\r\nblemishes of their works were then their most admired qualities. The\r\nclassical sympathies which we usually leave in schools and colleges,\r\nor which, when carried prominently about us in the busy world are\r\nstigmatised as a pedantic and ungraceful encumbrance, were then in\r\nhigh fashion. They were indispensable to the man of liberal education\r\nas his sword and buckler to the soldier; they were adopted among\r\nthe conventional elements of all literature, poetry, and taste.\r\nA standard being thus set up so antipathic to the ideas of our\r\npractical age, we are called upon, before proceeding to judgment, to\r\ndivest ourselves of prejudices which may in their turn become the\r\nmarvel and ridicule of our posterity.\r\n\r\nThe inherent defects of that minstrelsy,\r\n\r\n     \"Whose melody gave ease to Petrarch's wounds,\"\r\n\r\nhave been aptly set forth by Roscoe, but he appears to overlook its\r\nspecial adaptation for the Italian tongue. Limited to one theme,\r\nwhich it is required to exhaust in a fixed number of lines, and\r\nfettered by the frequent and stated recurrence of a few rhymes, no\r\nlanguage less copious and pliant can be woven into a sonnet, without\r\noccasionally betraying, in bald, formal, or rugged versification,\r\nthe torture to which it has been subjected. Again, the constraint\r\nand mannerism which often deform this metrical composition in\r\nother idioms are here its safeguard from a mellifluous but insipid\r\nverbiage, so often fatal to the lyrics of Italy: on a poetry\r\nhabitually turgid and redundant, terseness is thus absolutely imposed.\r\n\r\nWith these few words of apology for doggerel hexameters and\r\nindifferent sonnets, we shall shortly pass in review some of those\r\nwho thus wooed the muses in the Montefeltrian court.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most widely known names of this age was FRANCESCO\r\nFILELFO, whose venal pen often wantoned in biting lampoons,\r\nwhose sickening vanity was obtruded in the most repulsive egotism,\r\nand whose vagrant habits strangely combined assiduous study with lax\r\nmorals. In most respects he anticipated the bad notoriety acquired\r\na century later by Pietro Aretino, and like him alternately fawned\r\nupon and flagellated princely patrons of literature. Were his life\r\nto be written, it would be difficult to extract truth by balancing\r\nhis own self-vaunting letters against the scurrilous philippics of\r\nhis untiring enemy Poggio Bracciolini. But we are fortunately spared\r\nthis task, and may refer to Tiraboschi, Roscoe, and Shepherd for\r\nillustrations of his restless existence and fractious temper.[82]\r\nIn both these respects GIAN MARIA,[*83] the son, seems to\r\nhave resembled Francesco the father, whilst he even exceeded him in\r\nthe number and variety of his compositions. He sought audiences in\r\nmany cities of Italy and Provence for his prelections in grammar and\r\nphilosophy, as well as for his improvisations of Latin or Italian\r\nverse; and among the numerous patrons he thus courted was the good\r\nKing René, who bestowed on him the laurel crown, a guerdon which his\r\nrude numbers ill-deserved at the hands of that graceful troubadour.\r\nTiraboschi makes no allusion to his intercourse with Duke Federigo,\r\nwhereof we know little beyond two works which he inscribed to that\r\nPrince, and which remain unedited in the Vatican Urbino Library.\r\nThe former of these, dated at Modena in 1464, was corrected by the\r\nauthor, \"doctor in arts and both faculties of law, knight, and poet\r\nlaureat,\" he being then in his thirty-eighth year. It is numbered\r\n702, and contains about two thousand five hundred Latin hexameters\r\nand pentameters, entitled _Martiados_, an obvious imitation of his\r\nfather's _Sfortiados_. The theme is thus set forth in a dedication to\r\nthe Duke of Urbino:--\r\n\r\n     \"Primus et in Martem quæ sint pia fata Tonantis,\r\n       Et manibus nati monstra parenta refert;\r\n     At liber et bellis laudatque et honore secundus,\r\n       Et gestis magnum rebus in orbe Ducem.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: TIRABOSCHI, _Storia della Letteratura\r\nItaliana_, VI., ii., p. 317-30; SHEPHERD'S _Life of Poggio\r\nBracciolini_, _passim_; ROSCOE'S _Lorenzo de' Medici_, ch.\r\ni.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *83: Cf. FLAMINI, _Versi inediti da G.M. Filelfo_\r\n(Livorno, 1892, per nozze).]\r\n\r\nThe very moderate anticipations raised by this proemium, which we\r\nleave in its rugged original, are not surpassed in the context, dull\r\nand common-place as it is in sentiment, prosaic and unpolished in\r\nstyle. Losing sight of his avowed object of keeping apart the deeds\r\nof Mars, the ancient divinity, from those of Federigo, his living\r\ntype, in order to illustrate the parallel which it is his plan to\r\ndraw between them, he strangely jumbles both; and, following the\r\nnew-born classicism of the day, he has crammed his rough verses with\r\nnearly every name that heathen mythology, history, or geography can\r\nmuster, in senseless and jarring confusion. With a view to exalt\r\nhis hero as a second Hercules, he enumerates a series of labours\r\nand achievements from his childhood, when he sprang from bed and\r\nstrangled a snake that had frightened all his attendants. This is\r\nfollowed by a farrago of allegorical struggles, combats, and triumphs\r\nover temptations or evil principles, anticipating somewhat the idea\r\nof the _Pilgrim's Progress_, but with this important difference, that\r\nthe motives, arms, and aids are all borrowed from pagan mythology.\r\nSo entirely is Federigo lost among the gods and demigods who crowd\r\nthe stage, that his character or actions are seldom brought on the\r\nforeground at all, and never with sufficient idiosyncracy to avail\r\nfor the development of either. Finally, we find him deified in\r\nOlympus, and the epic closes with an empty bravado that none ever\r\nmore worthily emulated Alcides.\r\n\r\nThe other MS. of Gian Maria Filelfo which demands a passing note is\r\nNo. 804 of the same library, and is dated seven years later than the\r\n_Martiados_. It contains some six thousand Italian verses, consisting\r\nfor the most part of minor poems on a variety of subjects; the\r\nvolume is dedicated to Federigo, but many of the _Canzoni morali_\r\nare inscribed to distinguished personages, not omitting the Duke's\r\nrancorous foe Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, to whose vanity such\r\nincense could not have been unpalatable. In treating of religious\r\ntopics, the author, for the time, and by an effort, lays aside the\r\npagan strain which prevails in his other lays, and though generally\r\nselecting the sonnet or _terza rima_, he thus affects to disclaim all\r\nrivalry with their mighty masters:--\r\n\r\n     \"To these rude rhymes, alas, nor Petrarch's style\r\n     Is given, nor the good Dante's pungent file.\"\r\n\r\nYet there is considerable ambition in the rhythm, and although\r\nprolix, like other contemporary compositions, and inflated by\r\nsuperabundant episodes, it is not devoid of occasional poetic\r\nfeeling. In the dedicatory address he thus speaks of his volume:--\r\n\r\n     \"De! dunque Signor mio, per tua merciede\r\n       Con lieta fronte schorri esto libretto,\r\n       Il qual sotto il tuo titolo honor chiede.\r\n     Forse leggiendol' ne fia alcun dilecto,\r\n       Per esser di molte herbe uno orticciuolo,\r\n       Quantunque el vi sia dentro erro e diffecto:\r\n     Pur che 'l non sia di tutto il vano orciuolo\r\n       Col qual l'aqua si tira, da le donne\r\n       Che feciono ai mariti si gran duolo.\r\n     Ogni casa non è posta in colonne;\r\n       Ognuno esser non può Dante o Patrarcha;\r\n       Ognun non porta pretiose gonne.\r\n     Ma spesse volte piccoletta barcha\r\n       Arriva in luoco, ove andando s'anniegha\r\n       Tal grossa nave che molto è men charcha.\r\n     De! s'al huom val quanto il Signor più priegha,\r\n       China la fronte altiera a questa scorza,\r\n       Ch'in questo mio arbor del pieta non niegha.\r\n     Et come il navichare hor poggia, hor orza,\r\n       Hor pope avvien, secondo i venti e l'onde\r\n       Cosi convien ch'in vario error mi torza.\r\n     Hor la mia voglia la ragion confonde,\r\n       Hor l'appetito impera, hor vivo in doglia,\r\n       Hor lieto, hor desioso, et non so donde.\r\n     Qual l'autunno ogni verde arbor spoglia,\r\n       Inverno asciugha, e primavera inverde,\r\n       Tal varia e nostra externa et mental voglia.\r\n     Ma tristo chiunque indarno il tempo perde,\r\n       Ch'è peggio ch'esser rozzo e senza lima,\r\n       Però che chi non è mai non riverde.\r\n     De! leggi, Signor mio, la vulghar ryma,\r\n       Et sia ti un modo da cacciar la noia,\r\n       Quando di gran facciende hai maggior stima.\"\r\n\r\nAs we shall give a place in our Appendix to Giovanni Sanzi's judgment\r\nupon the painters of his day, we may here insert Filelfo's sonnet to\r\nGentile Bellini.\r\n\r\n     \"Bellin! s'io t'hebbi mai fitto nel cuore,\r\n       Se mai chognobbi it tuo preclaro ingiegno,\r\n       Hor confess'io che sei fra gli altri degno,\r\n       D'haver qual hebbe Apelle ogni alto honore.\r\n     Veduta ho l'opra tua col suo cholore,\r\n       La venustà col suo sguardo benegno,\r\n       Ogni suo movimento et nobil segno\r\n       Che ben demonstri il tuo gientil valore.\r\n     Gientile! io t'ero affectionato assai,\r\n       Parendomi la tua virtu più rara\r\n       Che soglia esser l'ucciel che è solo al mondo;\r\n     Ne pingier sa chi da te non impara,\r\n       Che gloria a quegli antiqui hormai tolta hai,\r\n       In chi questa arte postha ogni suo pondo.\r\n         Forsse che troppo habondo\r\n       A te che non ti churi di tue lode,\r\n       Ma diciendone assai l'alma mia ghode.\"\r\n\r\nWhen compared with contemporary efforts, these specimens, and others\r\nwhich it would be easy to add, deserve a better fate than the neglect\r\nto which, in common with most of their author's works, they have been\r\nconsigned; nor do they bear out the imputation of careless haste,\r\nalleged by Tiraboschi as the prevailing error of his very numerous\r\nand various productions. The paucity of these which have issued from\r\nthe press may, however, be taken as confirming that judgment, as\r\nwell as the suppression of his narrative of the campaign of Finale\r\nin 1447, after it had been printed by Muratori for his Scriptores.\r\nBut poetry may be accounted his forte,--a somewhat remarkable\r\ncircumstance, considering the unrivalled reputation he established as\r\nan _improvisatore_ of verses on any number not exceeding one hundred\r\nthemes suddenly proposed, as such facility has rarely been conjoined\r\nwith true poetic fire.\r\n\r\nIt were to be desired that we knew more of his intercourse with\r\nDuke Federigo. In one of his dedicatory epistles, after alluding\r\nto the likelihood of that prince reading the work, he, in a vein of\r\nfulsome compliment and impudent conceit, complains of neglect from\r\nfriends, and hints at a visit to Urbino. It is difficult to glean\r\nfacts from the vague common-places of such letters; but in 1468 he\r\nthanks his patron for retaining at his court Demetrio Castreno, a\r\nlearned Greek fugitive from Constantinople. Equally mannered and\r\ncold are his flattery and his condolence, on the death of Countess\r\nBattista in 1472. Next year he writes that, having begun a commentary\r\non Federigo's life, and completed two books, he had been induced to\r\nsubmit them to the Duke of Milan, from whom he never could recover\r\nthe manuscript.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother _protégé_ of Duke Federigo was PORCELLIO PANDONIO,\r\nof Naples,[*84] whose pen was ever at command of the readiest\r\npatron, as historiographer or laureate. From his partiality to the\r\ndesignations of bard and secretary to Alfonso of Naples, it would\r\nseem that he chiefly rested his fame on his poetical compositions.\r\nFrom this judgment Muratori differs, protesting that in historical\r\nnarrative none excelled his ease and elegance of diction.[85] Abject\r\nclassicism, in thought and style, was then a common weakness of\r\nthe learned; and however correctly Porcellio may have caught the\r\nLatin phraseology, it is difficult to get over the jarring effect\r\nof an idiom and nomenclature foreign to the times and incidents\r\nwhich it is his object vividly to portray. In his printed work, on\r\nthe campaigns of 1451-2, between Venice and Milan, he uniformly\r\ndisguises Sforza and Piccinino, their respective commanders, as\r\nScipio and Hannibal, under which _noms de guerre_ it requires a\r\nconstant effort to recognise mediæval warriors, or to recollect\r\nthat we are considering events dating some two thousand years after\r\nthose who really bore them had been committed to the dust. The same\r\naffectation, common to many authors of his day, mars his unpublished\r\nwritings which we have had occasion to examine in the Vatican Urbino\r\nLibrary, and their authority is greatly impaired by what Muratori\r\nwell calls \"prodigality of praise\" to his heroes, that is, to his\r\ngenerous patrons. In a beautifully elaborated MS. (No. 373) he has\r\ncollected, under the title of Epigrams, nearly fifty effusions in\r\nhonour of our Duke and Duchess, and of members of their family\r\nor court, a favourite theme being the love-inspired longings of\r\nBattista for her lord's return from the wars. In the same volume\r\nis his Feltria, an epic composed at Rome about 1472, and narrating\r\nFederigo's campaigns, from that of 1460-1, under the banner of Pius\r\nII., by whose command Porcellio undertook to sing his general's\r\nprowess in three thousand Virgilian verses. Its merits may be fairly\r\nappreciated from extracts already given,[86] and from this allusion\r\nto the state of Italy at the outbreak of the war:--\r\n\r\n     \"Jamque erat Ausoniæ populos pax alta per omnes,\r\n     Et tranquilla quies: jam nulli Martis ad aras\r\n     Collucent ignes; jam victima nulla cadebat.\r\n     Dantur thura Jovi; fumabat oliva Minervæ:\r\n     Sus erat in pretio, Cereris aptissima sacris,\r\n     Pampineique dei caper, et qui vitibus amens\r\n     Officit, atque merum ante aras cum sanguine fundit.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *84: Porcellio Napolitano was the laureate and secretary\r\nof Alphonso I. of Aragon and of Naples, and later the secretary and\r\nfamiliar of Sigismondo Malatesta. Porcellio seems to have hated\r\nBasinio, another court poet, whose works, with a long commentary,\r\nhave been published (BATTAGLINI, _Basinii, Parmensis Poetæ\r\nOpera Præstantiora_ (Rimini, 1794)). Basinio seems to have proved\r\nbefore the Court of Rimini that Porcellio was ignorant of Greek.\r\n\"One can be a fine Latin poet without knowing Greek,\" he answered in\r\na rage, but truly enough. Basinio, however, asserted that not only\r\nVirgil and all the great poets and prose writers knew Greek, but\r\nshowed that while that language was forgotten Italy was plunged in\r\ndarkness. But enough of such absurdities, which have besides nothing\r\nto do with Urbino or even Dennistoun's history of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Nearly all we know of him will be found in the\r\nScriptores, XX., 67, and XXV., 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: See vol. I., pp. 209-11. Portions of the same poem\r\nare contained in Nos. 709 and 710 of the Urbino Library, the former\r\ncorrected by the author, the latter in his autograph. Some of his\r\nminor lyrics were published at Paris in 1549, along with those of two\r\nother minstrels who sang the praises of the Malatesta.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the foreign poets who frequented Duke Federigo's court.\r\nIts native bards left few works meriting particular notice, with one\r\ninteresting exception. We have elsewhere to discuss Giovanni Sanzi\r\nor Santi,[*87] of Urbino, his merits as a painter, and the celebrity\r\nreflected on him from the eminence of his son, the unequalled\r\nRaffaele. Here we shall speak of his epic on that Duke's life, of\r\nwhich we have made frequent use in our first volume, and which\r\ndemands attention on account of its excellence, as well as from the\r\nintimate connection with our subject of its author and theme.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *87: On Giovanni Santi, see CAMPORI, _Notizie\r\ne docum. per la vita di Giov. Santi e di Raffaello Santi da\r\nUrbino_ (Modena, 1870); GUERRINI, _Elogio Stor. di Giov.\r\nSanti_ (Urbino, 1822); SCHMARZOW, _Giovanni Santi der Vater Raffaels_,\r\nin _Kunstchronik_ (Leipsig), An. XXIII., No. 27; SCHMARZOW, _Giovanni\r\nSanti_ in _Vierteljahrsschrift für Kultur und Lett. der Renaissance_\r\n(Leipsig), vol. II., Nos. 2-4. Cf. also CROWE & CAVALCASELLE, _History\r\nof Painting in Italy_, vol. III.]\r\n\r\nThis poem, having remained unedited in the Vatican arcana, long\r\nescaped the literary historians of the Peninsula, but it has been\r\nrecently quoted by two writers, Pungileone and Passavant, the former\r\nof whom had not seen it.[88] Although, in his dedication to Duke\r\nGuidobaldo, composed after 1490, the author accounts for his becoming\r\na painter, as we shall see in chapter xxviii., he gives no further\r\nexplanation of the motives which inspired the labour of a poem,\r\ncontaining some twenty-four thousand lines, than \"that after anxious\r\nthought and consideration of such new ideas as offered themselves, I\r\nwished to sing in this little used style of _terza rima_, the story\r\nof your most excellent and most renowned father's glorious deeds,\"\r\nwhose \"brilliant reputation not only was and is well known throughout\r\nItaly, but is, if I may say so, the subject of discourse beyond the\r\nCaucasus,\" \"not without a conscious blush at the idea of dipping so\r\nmean a vessel in the water of this limpid and sparkling spring.\"\r\nWith equal modesty, he deprecates all rivalry with the learned\r\ncommentators who had celebrated the same theme in Latin, limiting the\r\nambition of his \"rude and brief compend\" to rendering its interest\r\naccessible to more ordinary readers; but, looking back upon his\r\ntwenty-three ample cantos, he fervently thanks the Almighty that an\r\nundertaking of so extended time and toil had at length attained its\r\ntermination, and concludes by \"humbly beseeching that you will regard\r\nthe hero's far-famed actions, rather than the baseness of my style,\r\nwhose only grace is the sincere devotion of a faithful servant to his\r\nlord.\" A similar tone marks the outset of his Chronicle:--\r\n\r\n     \"If e'er in by-gone times a shallow mind\r\n     Shrank from the essay of a grand design,\r\n     So quake I in the labour-pangs of fear.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _Elogio Storico di Giovanni Santi_, pp. 14 and 69,\r\netc.; Rafael von Urbino. The original and only MS. is described in\r\nIII. of our Appendix.]\r\n\r\nCompared with contemporary epics, the rhythm is smooth and flowing,\r\nand the style dignified, interspersed with highly poetical episodes\r\nand finely expressed moral reflections as well as apt illustrations\r\nfrom ancient history and mythology. The epithets, though abundant,\r\nare more than usually appropriate, and many terse maxims are happily\r\nintroduced. Yet, in his object of placing his poem and his hero among\r\nthe popular literature of the day, Giovanni must have failed, the\r\nVatican MS. being the only known copy. Readers it, however, doubtless\r\nhad, one of whom has curiously commemorated his admiration by jotting\r\non the margin, \"Were you but as good a painter as a poet, who knows!\"\r\nModern critics, contrasting his fresco at Cagli with the rhyming\r\nChronicle, would probably arrive at an inverse conclusion, especially\r\nwere they to pronounce upon the latter from the preamble which called\r\nforth that exclamation--an allegorical vision, told in nine weary\r\nchapters, wherein figure a motley crowd of mythological and heroic\r\npersonages belonging to ancient and contemporary times.\r\n\r\nIt would occasion much useless repetition to enter here into any\r\ndetailed analysis of the work, as we have formerly drawn upon its\r\nmost valuable portions for the history of Duke Federigo. When\r\nconsidering the state of the fine arts, we shall have to notice\r\na very important part of the poem touching upon that subject--an\r\næsthetic episode on the art and artists of his day, which is\r\nintroduced on occasion of the Duke's visit to Federigo I., Marquis of\r\nMantua. In regard to the merit of this epic, due allowance must be\r\nmade for the taste of the age. Its great length necessarily infers a\r\ntediousness of detail much more adapted to prose than verse, indeed\r\ninherently prosaic. Yet it contains not a few continuous passages\r\nof sustained beauty, and it would not be difficult to cull many a\r\nsparkling thought and bright simile, while from time to time the\r\ndull narrative is enlivened by lyric touches and strokes of poetic\r\nfancy, adorning sentiments creditable to the genius and the heart\r\nof its author, who, with much sweetness of disposition, appears to\r\nhave possessed endowments beyond his humble sphere. His patriotic\r\nindignation at the ceaseless broils and strifes which convulsed his\r\nfatherland may supply us with an example or two:--\r\n\r\n     \"Ma non potendo Italia in pace stare\r\n       Sotto lunga quiete, o mai, parendo\r\n       Putrida vile e maricia diventare.\"\r\n\r\n     No long repose Ausonia e'er can brook,\r\n     For peace to her brings languor, and she deems\r\n     It loathsome to lie fallow.\r\n\r\n     \"Cum qual costum, che Italia devora,\r\n       Del sempre stare in gran confusione,\r\n       Disjunta et seperata, e disiare\r\n       L'un stato al altro sua destructione.\"\r\n\r\n     Sad is the usage that Italia wastes\r\n     In ceaseless struggles, aye for separate ends;\r\n     Sever'd her states, and each on others' ills\r\n     Intent.\r\n\r\n                           \"O mischinella\r\n     Italia! in te, acecata e disunita\r\n     Hor per dollor, te batte ogni mascella.\"\r\n\r\n     Ah, poor and wretched Italy! all blind\r\n     And disunited, chattering thy jaws\r\n     In torments sad.\r\n\r\n     \"O instabil fortuna! che fai secco\r\n       Ogni arbor verde, quando te impiacere,\r\n       In un momento.\"\r\n\r\n     Ah fickle fortune! which the greenest tree\r\n     Mayst in a moment wither at thy will.\r\n\r\nThe following sentiments were likely to find little sympathy among\r\nhis contemporaries:--\r\n\r\n     \"Il sfrenato desio che nel cor tiene\r\n       Di nuova signoria e altrui dominio\r\n       L'huom mai si satia; e pur morir conviene.\"\r\n\r\n     Man ne'er his soul's unbridled lust can slake\r\n     Of further sovereignty, and wider sway;\r\n     Yet 'tis appointed him to die.\r\n\r\n       \"Che el facto d'arme se devea fare\r\n       Sol per due cose, e l'altre lassar gire:\r\n     L'uno è per lo avantagio singolare\r\n       E grande oltra misura; e in caso extremo\r\n       Si deve l'huomo a la fortuna dare.\"\r\n\r\n     Twain are the pleas that justly may be urged\r\n     For armed aggression,--aggrandisement great\r\n     Beyond all calculation, or extreme\r\n     Necessity: nought else can justify\r\n     Such hazard of men's fortunes.\r\n\r\nA long and somewhat tedious chapter of moralities on the uncertain\r\ntenure of life among princes, introduced after describing the\r\nassassination of Galeazzo Maria Duke of Milan, in 1476, opens\r\nfinely:--\r\n\r\n     \"Vedendo il breve e vil peregrinare\r\n       Che noi facciam per questo falso mondo,\r\n       Anzi un pugno di terra al ver narrare,\r\n     Dove, con tanto afanno e tanto pondo,\r\n       De dì e nocte, e inextimabil cure,\r\n       Cerchiam sallire in alto e andamo al fondo.\r\n     Qual e quel si potente che asicure\r\n       Ogi la vita sua per l'altro giorno,\r\n       Tante son spesse et orende le sciagure?\"\r\n\r\n     Seeing how brief the pilgrimage and vile,\r\n     Whereby through this false world we wend our way,\r\n     A little earth our only heritage,\r\n     Where day and night, with pain and load of care\r\n     Incalculable, still we seek to soar,\r\n     Yet ever downward sink: where is the man\r\n     Potent to day, to-morrow's life to count,\r\n     So frequent its mishaps and horrible?\r\n\r\nThe bland transition from a rigorous winter to balmy Italian spring\r\nis thus apostrophised:--\r\n\r\n                     \"Intanto el verno\r\n       El mondo gia copria col fredo smalto;\r\n     E raro volte fu che el tempo iberno\r\n       Tanto terribile fusse, onde asvernarsi\r\n       Tucti ne andar, per fin che del inferno\r\n     Proserpina torno, per adornarsi\r\n       De vaghi fiori e de novelle fronde,\r\n       Cum lauree chiome al vento dolce sparsi.\"\r\n\r\n     Winter meanwhile the far-spread world had clad\r\n     In cold enamel; rarely was it known\r\n     More rigid: gladly all the troops retired\r\n     To quarters, waiting Proserpine's return\r\n     On earth, with beauteous flowers bedecked, and leaves\r\n     Of freshest green, when in the gentle breeze\r\n     Should stream her laurel tresses.\r\n\r\nThe poet's eloquent tribute to Florentine freedom, and its value to\r\nthe cause of liberty, must close our sparing extracts.[89]\r\n\r\n     \"Perche privato el popul Fiorentino\r\n       Della sua libertade, era cavare\r\n       Un occhio a Italia, e metterla al declino.\"\r\n\r\n     For to curtail fair Florence of her freedom\r\n     Were to pluck forth an eye from Italy,\r\n     And cause her orb to wane.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: See others in vol. I., and _passim_ in Book II.; also\r\nin IV. of the Appendix below.]\r\n\r\nIn Sanzi's Chronicle we seek in vain for the riper beauties of\r\nsucceeding epics; but the flashes of poetry which it embodies are\r\nnot the less effective from their simple diction, nor from the\r\ncomparatively unpolished narrative which they adorn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo. 699 of the Urbino MSS. contains the collected minor poems and\r\nsongs of ANGELO GALLI of Urbino, knight, and secretary to\r\nDuke Federigo. They are three hundred and seventy-six in number,\r\nall in Italian, and unedited, but beautifully transcribed on vellum\r\nby Federigo Veterani. Although varied by the introduction of sacred\r\nsubjects, most of them are occasional amorous effusions, wherein\r\nnames of the Montefeltri, Malatesta, Sforza, and other Umbrian\r\nfamilies frequently occur. The dates affixed to them extend from\r\n1428 to 1457. It appears that the author attended the Council of\r\nBasle in 1442, and he is said by Crescimbeni to have survived until\r\n1496. His mellowed versification is in general superior to that of\r\nthe age, while his trite and limited matter is pleasingly relieved\r\nby many happy turns of thought and graces of language. Though unable\r\nto supply any particulars of one who has almost escaped notice, we\r\ngive place to two specimens of his muse. His canzonet addressed to\r\nCaterina, \"the noble, beautiful, discreet, charming, gentle, and\r\ngenerous Countess of Urbino,\" runs thus:\r\n\r\n     \"El mirabil splendor del tuo bel viso\r\n     Pusilanimo famme, a tanta parte\r\n     Che l'ingegno in tal carte\r\n     Non tangeria, s'il ver ch'io non errasse.\r\n     Forsa che la natura in paradiso\r\n     Per aiuto sali ad informarte,\r\n     E poi per divin arte\r\n     A gloria de se eterna giù te trasse.\r\n     Qual oro si micante s'aguagliasse\r\n     Cum sua chiareza a tui biondi capegli!\r\n     E gli occhi, ch'a vede gli\r\n     L'invidia affreccia el sol a ricolcarse.\r\n     Qual perle, qual coragli, al riso breve!\r\n     Le guance han sangue, spirto in bianca neve!\"\r\n\r\nThe other is upon Costanza Varana, wife of Alessandro Sforza, and\r\nmother of Battista Countess of Urbino.\r\n\r\n     \"Che la sua faccia bella\r\n     Mostro d'inverno sempre primavera,\r\n     Real costume, aspetto di signora,\r\n     Viso di dea e d'angioli a favella.\r\n\r\n     Ma questa donna, ch'a la mente diva,\r\n     Depinge di honestà omne suo gesto:\r\n     Non pur suo guardo honesto,\r\n     Ma li suo panni, gridan' pudicitia.\r\n\r\n     Questa madonna è el mar' de tutto el senno\r\n     Renchiuso, e posto dentro da bel ciglio,\r\n     Chi vuol vecchio consiglio\r\n     Recinga ai teneri anni di costei.\r\n\r\n     Mille viole e fiore\r\n     Sparge sopra la neve el suo bel viso;\r\n     E dolce del suo riso\r\n     Faria piatoso Silla a la vendetta,\r\n     E spontaria de Giove omne saetta.\"\r\n\r\nFEDERIGO VETERANI has been repeatedly mentioned as a\r\ntranscriber of MSS. for Duke Federigo, whom he also served as\r\nlibrarian and secretary, besides being one of the judges at Urbino.\r\nThose who have had occasion to examine the library formed by that\r\nprince, are well acquainted with his beautiful autograph, and might\r\nimagine his whole life to have been spent upon its fair volumes. One\r\nof them, containing the Triumphs of Petrarch, No. 351, is subscribed\r\nby him, with a memorandum that it was the last of about sixty volumes\r\nhe had written out before the death of Federigo, which he thus\r\ndeplores:--\r\n\r\n     \"Fedrico Veterano fui, che scripse\r\n       Questo e molti altri, cum justa mercede,\r\n       Usando diligentia, amore et fede\r\n       Al Duca Federigo in sin ch'el vixe:\r\n     Le cui memorie sempre al mondo fixe\r\n       Sonno e seranno; e ben certo si crede,\r\n       Mentre sta el mondo e la natura in pede\r\n       Ch'ogni virtù dal cielo in lui venisse.\r\n     Quello mi piango, e mai ho 'l viso asciutto;\r\n       Quel chiamo, quel mi sogno, e quel mi stringo\r\n       Ai labri, sculpto in cara tavletta;\r\n     La qual, così machiata del mio lucto,\r\n       Adoro, honoro in verso, e vivo el fingo,\r\n     Per lenimento di mia vita abiecta.\"[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: See a translation of these lines, vol. I., p. 269.]\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to his miscellaneous avocations, Veterani was a\r\ncopious versifier. Besides an epic, De Progenie Domus Feretranæ,\r\nthere are other volumes of poetry, apparently his, remaining unedited\r\nin the library,[91] of which he continued custodian until the reign\r\nof Francesco Maria I. One of those beautiful manuscripts, the fair\r\nvellum and gem-like illuminations of which have been the theme of\r\nmany a eulogy, contains the collected verses of Cristoforo Landini\r\nand six other less-known poets of the fifteenth century. On the\r\nconcluding page, in a trembling and blotted hand, we read these\r\ntouching lines, the tribute of its lettered scribe to the temporary\r\neclipse of his sovereign's dynasty:[92]--\r\n\r\n     \"1517.\r\n\r\n     \"FEDERICUS VETERANUS, URBINAS BIBLIOTHECARIUS, AD REI\r\n     MEMORIAM.\r\n\r\n     \"Ne careat lacrymis liber hic, post fata Feretri,\r\n       Hic me subscripsi, cumque dolore gravi.\r\n     Hunc ego jamdudum Federicus, stante Feretro,\r\n       Transcripsi, (gratus vel fuit ille mihi\r\n     Quem modo vel semper fas est lugere parentem,\r\n       Et dominum qui me nutriit,) atque diu\r\n     Pagina testis erit, lacrymis interlita multis,\r\n       Hæc tibi, qui moesta hæc carmina pauca legis.\r\n     Et si dissimilis conclusit littera librum,\r\n       Scriptorem ignarum me dolor ipse facit.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1293, 303, 699.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: _Ibid._, No. 368, f. 188.]\r\n\r\nAmong the minor fry slumbering unknown in the Vatican Library\r\nis URBANI of Urbino, who left a few rude elegiac and complimentary\r\nditties in Latin or Italian upon members of the Montefeltrian line,\r\nand compiled a confused account of their pedigree. We may also name\r\nANTONIO RUSTICO of Florence, whose _Panegiricon Comitis Federici_,\r\ndedicated to him in 1472, contains above seven hundred Italian lines\r\nof _terza rima_, unpolished in style, and in matter a mere tissue of\r\nfatiguing verbiage. Scarcely more valuable is NALDIO'S account of the\r\nVolterran campaign of 1572 in Latin verse, to which we have vainly\r\nhad recourse for new information on that obscure passage of our\r\nmemoirs.[93]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: These three works are Nos. 736, 743, and 373.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile enumerating in our twenty-first chapter the celebrities of Duke\r\nGuidobaldo's court, we mentioned Bernardo Accolti, and endeavoured\r\nto explain the inadequacy of his published works to sustain his\r\ncontemporary reputation, by supposing that his strength lay in\r\nextemporé recitation. The high place which his vanity claimed, in\r\nassuming \"the Unique\" as a surname, appears to have been freely\r\naccorded by the most able of his contemporaries. Ariosto says of him,\r\nnot perhaps without a sneer at his notorious conceit,--\r\n\r\n     \"The cavalier amid that band, whom they\r\n     So honour, unless dazzled in mine eye\r\n     By those fair faces, is the shining light\r\n     Of his Arezzo, and Accolti hight.\"[94]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: STEWART ROSE'S Translation, XLVI., 10.]\r\n\r\nCastiglione assigns him a prominent rank among the Urbino stars,\r\nwhilst Bembo and Pietro Aretino testify to his merits. We, however,\r\nwould try these by his surviving works, which, as Roscoe observes,\r\nare fatal to his reputation, and which are indeed rather a beacon\r\nthan a model to succeeding genius. It is, therefore, unnecessary\r\nto pause upon them, or to add here to our previous notice of their\r\nauthor and his position at the Montefeltrian court. Nor was Accolti\r\nthe only poetaster who attained in that polished circle, or in other\r\nItalian courtlets, a celebrity from which posterity has withheld\r\nits seal. A solution of this success may perhaps be found in the\r\ncircumstance that many of these owed it either to personal popularity\r\nor to their musical accomplishments. Thus SERAFINO D'AQUILA,\r\nwho either improviséed his verses, or chanted them to his own\r\naccompaniment on the lute, was generally preferred to Petrarch.\r\nHe died at thirty-four, in 1500, after being sought by all the\r\npetty sovereigns from Milan to Naples, and ere two generations had\r\npassed away his poetry was utterly forgotten. So, too, AGOSTINO\r\nSTACCOLI of Urbino, whose sonnets delighted Duke Federigo, and\r\nobtained for him a diplomatic mission to Rome in 1485, has been long\r\nconsigned to oblivion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe older comedies of Italy become a subject of interest to us, for\r\none of the earliest was written by Bernardo Bibbiena, a friend of\r\nGuidobaldo I.,[95] and was first performed in the palace of Urbino.\r\nThe revival of the comic drama may be traced to Ferrara; and, though\r\nthe pieces originally represented there before Duke Ercole I. were\r\ntranslations from Plautus and Terence,[96] Ariosto made several\r\nboyish attempts to vary the entertainment by dramatic compositions\r\nof his own. This was just before 1500, and to about the same time\r\nTiraboschi ascribes the comedies of Machiavelli. There is thus\r\nmuch probability that these attempts preceded the _Calandra_ of\r\nBibbiena, which has, however, been generally considered the oldest\r\nregular comedy in the language. It seems also to have been the first\r\nthat attracted the notice of his patron Leo X., whose delight in\r\ncomic performances was excessive; and, although now superseded by\r\npieces more in accordance with the age, it long enjoyed a continued\r\npopularity. Giovo celebrates its easy and acute wit, and the talent\r\nof its mobile and merry author for scenic representation, which must\r\nhave greatly tended to ensure its success. It is doubtful in what\r\nyear it was played at the Vatican in presence of his Holiness, on\r\nthe visit of Isabella, Marchioness of Mantua, when the decorations\r\npainted by Baldassar Peruzzi obtained unbounded applause. But this\r\nprobably happened after its performance at Urbino, which collateral\r\nevidence discovered by Pungileone, has fixed as taking place in the\r\nspring of 1513.[*97] This gorgeous entertainment, and the scenery\r\nexecuted for it by Timoteo della Vite and Girolamo Genga, are\r\ncommemorated in a letter of Castiglione, which throws light upon the\r\nmanner of such festivities in that mountain metropolis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: See above, pp. 65-69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: See these described, vol. I., App. xiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *97: Cf. VERNARECCI, _Di Alcune Rappresentazioni\r\nDrammatiche alla Corte d'Urbino nel 1513_ in the _Arch. St. per le\r\nMarche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 181 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n     \"The scene was laid in an open space between a city-wall\r\n     and its farthest houses. From the stage downwards, there\r\n     was most naturally represented the wall, with two great\r\n     towers descending from the upper part of the hall, on one\r\n     of which were bagpipers, on the other trumpeters, with\r\n     another wall of fine proportion flanking them; thus the\r\n     hall figured as the town-ditch, and was traversed by two\r\n     walls to support the water. The side next the seats was\r\n     ornamented with Trojan cloth, over which there projected a\r\n     large cornice, with this Latin inscription, in great white\r\n     letters upon an azure ground, extending across that part of\r\n     the theatre:--\r\n\r\n          \"'BOTH WARS ABROAD AND SPORTS AT HOME\r\n            GREAT CÆSAR PATRONISED;\r\n          LIKE DOUBLE CARE BY MIGHTY MINDS\r\n            'MONGST US SHOULD STILL BE PRIZED.'\r\n\r\n     \"To the roof were attached large bunches of evergreens,\r\n     almost hiding the ceiling; and from the centres of the\r\n     rosettes there descended wires, in a double row along\r\n     the room, each supporting a candelabrum in the form of\r\n     a letter, with eight or ten lighted torches, the whole\r\n     diffusing a brilliant light, and forming the words\r\n     POPULAR SPORTS. Another scene represented a\r\n     beautiful city, with streets, palaces, churches, towers,\r\n     all in relief, but aided by excellent painting and\r\n     scientific perspective. There was, among other things,\r\n     an octagon temple in half-relief, so perfectly finished\r\n     that the whole workmen of the duchy scarcely seemed equal\r\n     to produce it in four months; it was all covered with\r\n     compositions in stucco: the windows were of imitation\r\n     alabaster, the architraves and cornices of fine gold and\r\n     ultramarine, with here and there gems admirably imitated in\r\n     glass; besides fluted columns, figures standing out with\r\n     the roundness of sculpture, and much more that it would\r\n     be long to speak of. This was about in the middle; and at\r\n     one end there was a triumphal arch, projecting a couple\r\n     of yards from the wall, and as well done as possible,\r\n     with a capital representation of the Horatii, between\r\n     the architrave and the vault, painted to imitate marble.\r\n     In two small niches, above the pilasters that supported\r\n     the arch, there were tiny figures of Victory in stucco,\r\n     holding trophies, whilst over it an admirable equestrian\r\n     statue in full armour was spearing a naked man at his feet.\r\n     On either side of this group was a little altar, whereon\r\n     there blazed a vase of fire during the comedy. I need not\r\n     recapitulate all, as your Lordship will have heard of it;\r\n     nor how one of the comedies was composed by a child and\r\n     recited by children, shaming mayhap their seniors, for\r\n     they really played it astonishingly; and it was quite a\r\n     novelty to see tiny odd men a foot high maintaining all the\r\n     gravity and solemnity of a Menander. Nor shall I say aught\r\n     of the odd music of this piece, all hidden here and there,\r\n     but shall come to the _Calandra_ of our friend Bernardo,\r\n     which afforded the utmost satisfaction. As its prologue\r\n     arrived very late, and the person who should have spoken\r\n     failed to learn it, one by me was recited, which pleased\r\n     much: but little else was changed, except some scenes of\r\n     no consequence, which perhaps they could not repeat. The\r\n     interludes were as follows. First, a _moresca_ of Jason,\r\n     who came dancing on the stage in fine antique armour,\r\n     with a splendid sword and shield, whilst there suddenly\r\n     appeared on the other side two bulls vomiting forth fire,\r\n     so natural as to deceive some of the spectators. These\r\n     the good Jason approached, and yoking them to the plough,\r\n     made them draw it. He then sowed the dragon's teeth, and\r\n     forthwith there sprang up from the stage antique warriors\r\n     inimitably managed, who danced a fierce _moresca_, trying\r\n     to slay him; and having again come on, the each killed the\r\n     other, but were not seen to die. After them, Jason again\r\n     appeared, with the golden fleece on his shoulders, dancing\r\n     admirably. And this was the first interlude. In the second\r\n     there was a lovely car, wherein sat Venus with a lighted\r\n     taper in her hand; it was drawn by two doves, which seemed\r\n     absolutely alive, and on which rode a couple of Cupids\r\n     with bows and quivers, and holding lighted tapers; and it\r\n     was preceded and followed by eight more Cupids, dancing\r\n     a _moresca_ and beating about with their blazing lights.\r\n     Having reached the extremity of the stage, they set fire\r\n     to a door, out of which there suddenly leaped nine gallant\r\n     fellows all in flames, and danced another _moresca_ to\r\n     perfection. The third interlude showed Neptune on a chariot\r\n     drawn by two demi-horses with fish-scales and fins, so\r\n     well executed. Neptune sat on the top with his trident,\r\n     and eight monsters after him (or rather four of them\r\n     before and four behind) performing a sword-dance, the car\r\n     all the while full of fire. The whole was capitally done,\r\n     and the monsters were the oddest in the world, of which no\r\n     description can afford an idea. The fourth showed Juno's\r\n     car, also full of fire, and herself upon it, with a crown\r\n     on her head and a sceptre in her hand, seated on a cloud,\r\n     which spread around the car, full of mouths of the winds.\r\n     The chariot was drawn by two peacocks, so beautiful and\r\n     well managed that even I, who had seen how they were made,\r\n     was puzzled. Two eagles and as many ostriches preceded\r\n     it; two sea-birds followed, with a pair of parti-coloured\r\n     parrots. All these were so admirably executed that I verily\r\n     believe, my dear Monsignore, no imitation was ever so like\r\n     the truth; and they, too, went through a sword-dance with\r\n     indescribable, nay incredible, grace. The comedy ended, one\r\n     of the Cupids, whom we had already seen, suddenly appeared\r\n     on the stage, and in a few stanzas explained the meaning\r\n     of the interludes, which had a continued plot apart from\r\n     the comedy, as follows. There was, in the first place,\r\n     the battle of these earth-born brothers, showing, under\r\n     the fabulous allegory of Jason, how wars prevail among\r\n     neighbours who ought to maintain peace. Then came Love,\r\n     successively kindling with a holy flame men and earth, sea\r\n     and air, to chase away war and discord, and to unite the\r\n     world in harmony: the union is but a hope for the future;\r\n     the discord is, to our misfortune, a present fact. I had\r\n     not meant to send you the stanzas recited by the little\r\n     Love, but I do so; your Lordship will do with them what\r\n     you like. They were hastily composed whilst struggling\r\n     with painters, carpenters, actors, musicians, and ballet\r\n     dancers. When they had been spoken, and the Cupid was\r\n     gone, there was heard the invisible music of four viols,\r\n     accompanying as many voices, who sang, to a beautiful air,\r\n     a stanza of invocation to Love; and so the entertainment\r\n     ended, to the immense delight of all present. Had I not\r\n     so bepraised it in describing its progress, I might now\r\n     tell you the part I had in it, but I should not wish your\r\n     Lordship to fancy me an egotist. It were too good fortune\r\n     to be able to attend to such matters, to the exclusion of\r\n     more annoying ones: may God vouchsafe it me.\"\r\n\r\nThough much of this detail regards the accompanying entertainment\r\nmore than the comedy, it cannot be deemed out of place, as\r\nillustrative of the way in which these were managed in a court where\r\nwe have frequent occasion to allude to such pastimes: the preceding\r\ndescription fully explains the often-mentioned _moresca_, and almost\r\nentitles us to translate that word by the better known French\r\n_ballet_. The _Calandra_ continued to be played on select occasions\r\nin Italy, and we hear of its being produced at Lyons in 1548, before\r\nCatherine de' Medici and her husband, whose largess to the actors\r\nexceeded 2500 crowns.\r\n\r\nThis piece, though improved in incidents, is avowedly indebted\r\nfor its plot to the _Menecmo_ of Plautus, a comedy already\r\npopular through a translation performed at Ferrara, in 1486-7, by\r\nthe children and courtiers of Ercole I., in a theatre built on\r\npurpose within the palace-yard, and costing with its decorations\r\n1000 ducats. In regard to its proper merits, no one can deny the\r\namusing complexity of the plot, the constant succession of absurd\r\nmistakes among the personages, the ingenious contrivances by which\r\nthese are alternately occasioned and extricated, the bustle of the\r\nentertainment, and the racy humour of the dialogue. In order to let\r\nthese be appreciated, an analysis larger than our space can permit\r\nwould be necessary, and neither the character nor the wit of the\r\npiece could be preserved without introducing intrigues and language\r\nrepugnant to modern decency. Ginguené has conveyed a tolerable\r\nidea of the comedy without greatly shocking the reader, but has\r\nconsequently suppressed much of its fun, and to his pages we must\r\nrefer for detail.[98] The story turns upon the adventures of twins,\r\na brother and sister, who, perfectly resembling in person, but\r\nunknown to each other, are simultaneously parties to love intrigues,\r\ncarried on through the agency of a clever valet, and at the cost of a\r\ndrivelling husband (Calandro) in the course of which they frequently\r\ninterchange the dress and character of their respective sexes, a\r\nmagician being ever at hand to bear the blame of what appear physical\r\ntransmutations, and a double marriage of course happily solving all\r\nembarrassments. Although unquestionably rich in the materials of\r\nbroad farce, it is evident that such a plot is but indifferently\r\nadapted for embodying manners sketched from life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: See also Panizzi's London edition of the _Orlando\r\nInnamorato_ and the _Furioso_, vol. VI., p. 59.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe corruption of morals in Italy during the golden age of her\r\nliterature and civilisation is a painful topic, but one naturally\r\nsuggested by these remarks, and which cannot with truth be entirely\r\nthrown into the shade.[*99] It was especially developed in the\r\nfree gratification of passions to which an enervating climate\r\nis considered peculiarly incentive, and which induce to amorous\r\nindulgence. The due restraint of these was reckoned neither among\r\nthe virtues nor the decencies of life, nor was their licentious\r\nexercise limited to persons of exalted station. The sad example set\r\nin luxurious courts spread to classes whose sacred calling and vows\r\nof continence rendered their lapses doubly disgraceful; and those\r\nwhose tastes and cultivated understandings were fitted for purer\r\nand nobler pursuits wallowed without discredit in the slough of\r\nsensuality. With such instances, even among the finest characters,\r\nthese pages render us unfortunately too familiar. Instead of\r\nmultiplying or repeating them, let us hear the calm admissions of a\r\nlate writer, whose evidence cannot be deemed partial on such a topic.\r\nIn talking of Bembo, the Italian translator of Roscoe's _Leo X._ thus\r\ntouches upon this delicate subject: \"It must be observed that most\r\nof the poets and writers of that age, although resident at Rome,\r\nand dignified by prelacies, preferments, and offices of the Church,\r\nwere infected with the like vices, or, as some would express it,\r\ntarred with the same pitch. The spirit of that court, the manners of\r\nthese times, the licence of ideas among literary men, their constant\r\nreading of ancient poets not always commendable for modesty, the\r\nlong established and uniform intercourse of the Muses with Bacchus\r\nand Venus, the fatal example afforded by certain cardinals, and\r\neven by several of the papal predecessors of Leo, whose children\r\nwere publicly acknowledged ... all these considerations show how\r\ndifficult it was at such an epoch, and especially in the capital of\r\nChristendom, to continue exempt from corruption and licentiousness.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *99: This hardly needs comment: it has become universally\r\naccepted as the truth. The _Prediche Volgari_ of Fra Bernardino\r\nafford ample evidence, as do the _Novelle_ generally. I shall\r\ntherefore confine myself to referring to two English writers who have\r\ntreated of this subject: WILLIAM HEYWOOD, _The Ensamples of\r\nFra Filippo_ (Siena, 1902), pp. 118, 122 _et seq._ and 295 _et seq._,\r\nwho gives an infinite number of authorities and is exhaustive in his\r\nevidence; VERNON LEE, _Euphorion_ (Fisher Unwin, 1899), pp.\r\n25-109, who treats of it in two essays, _The Sacrifice_ and _The\r\nItaly of the Elizabethan Dramatist_, with exquisite understanding and\r\nthe wide tolerance of a poet. Nothing is to be gained by going into\r\nthis subject so casually as Dennistoun does. He speaks of the Italian\r\ngenius without understanding either its strength or its weakness. He\r\njudges Machiavelli, for instance, or Cesare Borgia, as one might have\r\njudged an Englishman of the depressing age he himself lived in, and\r\nthus his judgment is at fault in regard to nearly every great man of\r\nwhom he writes.]\r\n\r\nIn no language, perhaps, does there exist a jest-book more\r\ndisgustingly prurient or so full of sacrilegious ribaldry as\r\nthe _Facetiæ_ of Poggio Bracciolini. Were such a work published\r\nnow-a-days, the author would be hooted from society, and the printer\r\nlaid hold of as a common nuisance. Though the parties to above half\r\nits obscene anecdotes are from the clergy or the monastic orders,\r\nthere occurs throughout the foul volume no word of blame nor burst\r\nof indignation. Yet it was compiled for publication by a priest,\r\nthe confidential secretary of pontiffs, and one of the stars of a\r\nliterary age. If more direct evidence of dissolute habits among the\r\nclergy be required, it will be found in the reports of P. Ambrogio\r\nTraversari on his disciplinarian circuits among the Camaldolese\r\nconvents, of which he was general from 1431 to 1434.[100] It would\r\nbe loathsome to enter upon the details, but a generally lax morality\r\namong those specially devoted to religious profession must be\r\nconsidered as at once the occasion and the effect of much social\r\nperversion. The poison disseminated from such a quarter was sure\r\nto pervade all ranks, and the standard of public decency must have\r\nsunk low indeed ere monastic debauchery ceased to create universal\r\nscandal. When churchmen had become very generally latitudinarians in\r\ntheology and libertines in morals, the corruption of their flocks\r\nneed be no matter of surprise. It was in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century that these evils had reached their height, and\r\nthe miseries of foreign invasion under the Medicean popes were even\r\nthen regarded by many as judicial inflictions from Heaven. Hence was\r\nit, that, although Italy was supereminent among nations, although\r\nillustrated by the triumphs of mind, adorned by the productions of\r\ngenius, and enriched by the gains of intelligent enterprise, she was\r\nnevertheless deficient in moral power, and when tried in the furnace\r\nof adversity was found wanting. With institutions whose freedom had\r\nno longer vitality, with rulers intent only on selfish ends, and with\r\ncitizens relaxed in principle and knit by no common political ties,\r\nthe very advantages lavished upon her by nature and civilisation\r\nproved her bane, attracting spoilers whom she was powerless to\r\nresist. Melancholy is the thought that all her mental superiority\r\nwas ineffectual for her defence; but yet more humiliating the fact\r\nthat those on whom nature's best gifts were showered, and who were\r\nforemost as protectors of literature and the arts, were often, by\r\ntheir fatal example, chief promoters of the general demoralisation.\r\nNo wonder then that she fell, and in her fall presented a signal\r\nlesson to future times \"of the impotence of human genius and of the\r\ninstability of human institutions, however excellent in themselves,\r\nwhen unsustained by public and private virtue.\"[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Hodoeporicon and Epistola, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: PRESCOTT'S _Ferdinand and Isabella_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n     Mediæval art chiefly religious--Innovations of Naturalism,\r\n     Classicism, and Paganism--character and tendencies of\r\n     Christian painting ill understood in England--influence of\r\n     St. Francis--Mariolatry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the peculiar tendency which painting assumed\r\nin Umbria, it will be necessary briefly to examine the principles\r\nand history of what is now generally known under the denomination of\r\nCHRISTIAN ART.[*102] Until after the revival of European\r\ncivilisation, painting had scarcely any other direction than\r\nreligious purposes. For household furniture and decoration, its\r\nluxuries were unheard of; the delineation of nature in portraits\r\nand landscapes was unknown. But pictorial representations had\r\nbeen employed for embellishment of churches from the recognition\r\nof Christianity by the Emperors of the West, and they had assumed\r\na conventional character, derived chiefly from rude tracings in\r\nwhich the uncultivated limners of an outcast sect had long before\r\ndepicted Christ, his Mother, and his apostles, for the solace of\r\nthose whose proscribed creed drove them to worship in the catacombs.\r\nWhen these delineations, originally cherished as emblems of faith,\r\nhad been employed as the adjuncts, and eventually perverted into\r\nthe objects of devotion, they acquired a sacred character which\r\nit was the tendency of ever-spreading superstition continually to\r\nexaggerate. They became, in fact, the originals of those pictures\r\nwhich in subsequent ages were adopted as part and portion of the\r\nRoman worship; and forms, which they derived perhaps from the\r\nfancy or caprice of their inventors, came to be the received types\r\nto which all orthodox painters were bound to adhere.[*103] The\r\nmeans adopted for repeating them were enlarged or narrowed by\r\nvarious circumstances; the success with which they were imitated\r\nfluctuated with the advance or decline of taste. But whether traced\r\nupon the tablets of ivory diptychs, or blazoned in the pages of\r\nilluminated missals; whether depicted on perishable ceilings,\r\nor fixed in unfading mosaics; whether degraded by the unskilful\r\ndaubing and spiritless mechanism of Byzantine artists,[*104] or\r\nrefined by the holier feeling and improved handling of the Sienese\r\nand Umbrian schools,--the original types might still be traced.\r\nIndeed, those traditionary forms were as little subjected to\r\nmodification by painters as the dogmas of faith were open to the\r\ndoubts of commentators. Heterodoxy on either point was liable to\r\nsevere denunciation, and pictorial novelties were interdicted by\r\nthe Church, not as absolutely wrong, but as liable to abuse from\r\nthe eccentricities of human fancy.[105] It was in Spain, the\r\nland of suspicion and priestcraft, that such jealousy was chiefly\r\nentertained, and the censorship of the fine arts there became in the\r\nsixteenth century a special duty of the Holy Office.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *102: I have not deleted these pages partly because it has\r\nbeen thought better to give the whole text as nearly as possible as\r\nDennistoun wrote it, and partly too because they serve to show that\r\nDennistoun was in advance of the general taste of his day in England.\r\nBut, of course, the whole of our knowledge about Italian art has\r\nbeen revolutionized since he wrote. It is almost hopeless to try to\r\nannotate these pages. To begin with, the author is dealing with a\r\nsubject of which even to-day we know very little. And then Urbino\r\nseems to have had almost nothing to do with the rise of the Umbrian\r\nschool of painting. The reader must therefore accept with care every\r\nstatement which follows.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *103: This is true in a sense, but the work in the\r\ncatacombs and the mosaics (III. cent.) in S. Maria Maggiore, for\r\ninstance, are based on classic models, and are often very excellent\r\nand beautiful.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *104: The Byzantine work was not always \"unskilful,\" only\r\nits intention seems to have been rather decorative than realistic,\r\nyet in _S. Maria Antigua_, for instance, we can see the models were\r\nclassical.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: A large picture of the Glorification of the Madonna,\r\nlong placed in the Belle Arti at Florence, was painted by Sandro\r\nBotticelli for Matteo Palmieri, who, in his Dantesque poem entitled\r\n_La Città della Vita_, has advanced a theory that, in Lucifer's\r\nrebellion, a certain number of angels assumed a neutral attitude,\r\nas a punishment for which they were doomed to a term of trial in\r\nthe quality of human souls. Although never printed, this work was\r\nsolemnly condemned by the Inquisition after the author's death,\r\nand the picture, which had been composed under his own direction,\r\nfell under similar suspicion of heresy. On a rigid examination, the\r\ncensors having discovered a sort of fullness in the draped bosoms\r\nof some angels, pronounced them females, and for this breach of\r\northodoxy denounced the painting. It was accordingly covered up,\r\nand the chapel where it hung in S. Pietro Maggiore was for a time\r\ninterdicted; but, having escaped destruction, it was offered for\r\nsale a few years ago by the heirs of Palmieri. The opportunity\r\nfor procuring for our national collection a most interesting and\r\ncharacteristic example of early art was as usual lost; but it was\r\nbrought to England by Mr. Samuel Woodburn in 1846, and has now found\r\na resting-place at Hamilton Palace, in one of the few collections of\r\nart which contain nothing common-place or displeasing.[*B]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *B: This picture, now in the National Gallery [No. 1126] is\r\nby Botticini, not Botticelli.]\r\n\r\nWith the aid of authorities thus deduced through an unbroken chain\r\nfrom primitive times,--to conceive and embody abstractions \"which\r\neye hath not seen nor ear heard,\" was reckoned no rash meddling\r\nwith sacred mysteries. On the contrary, the subjects almost\r\nexclusively selected for the exercise of Christian art, belonged to\r\nthe fundamental doctrines of Christian faith, to the traditional\r\ndogmas of the Church, to the legendary lives of the Saviour and of\r\nsaints, or to the dramatic sufferings of early martyrs. Such were\r\nthe transfiguration, the passion, the ascension of our Lord; the\r\nconception, the coronation, and the _cintola_ of the Madonna[106];\r\nthe birth and marriage of the Blessed Virgin; the miracles performed\r\nby popular saints, the martyrdoms in which they sealed their\r\ntestimony. The choice, and occasionally the treatment, of these\r\ntopics was modified to meet the spiritual exigences of the period,\r\nor the circumstances of the place, but ever in subservience to\r\nconventional standards derived from remote tradition. Thus we detect,\r\nin works of the Byzantine period, rigid forms, harsh outlines,\r\nsoulless faces; in the schools of Siena and Umbria, pure figures lit\r\nup by angelic expressions; in the followers of Giotto, a tendency to\r\nvaried movement and dramatic composition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: The Gospel account of St. Thomas's doubtings finds a\r\ncounterpart in the Roman legend of the Madonna, after her interment,\r\nbeing seen by him during her corporeal transit to heaven; whereupon,\r\nhis wonted caution having led him to \"ask for a sign,\" she dropped\r\nhim her girdle or _cintola_, which he carried to the other apostles\r\nin proof of his marvellous tale; and the fact of her assumption was\r\nverified by their opening her tomb and finding it empty.]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another reason for what to the uninitiated may seem\r\nmonstrosities. The old masters had not generally to represent men\r\nand women in human form, but either prophets, saints, and martyrs,\r\nwhom it was their business to embody, not in their \"mortal coil,\"\r\nbut in the purer substance of those who had put on immortality; or\r\nthe Mother of Christ, exalted by mariolatry almost to a parity with\r\nher Son; or the \"Ancient of Days,\"--the personages of the Triune\r\nDivinity with their attendant heavenly host, whom to figure at all\r\nwas a questionable licence, and who, if impersonated, ought surely\r\nto seem other than the sons and daughters of men. Of such themes\r\nno conception could be adequate, no approximation otherwise than\r\ndisappointing; and those who were called upon to deal with them\r\nusually preferred painting images suggested by their own earnest\r\ndevotional thoughts, to the more difficult task of idealising human\r\nmodels. Addressing themselves to the spirit rather than to the eye,\r\nthey sought to delineate features with nought of \"the earth, earthy,\"\r\nexpressions purified from grovelling interests and mundane ties.\r\n\r\nHow much this religious art depended for its due maintenance upon\r\nthe personal character of those whose business it was to embody and\r\ntransmit to a new generation its lofty inspirations, can scarcely\r\nrequire demonstration. That they were men of holy minds is apparent\r\nfrom their works. Some, by long poring over the mystic incarnations\r\nwhich they sought to represent; others, by deep study of the pious\r\nnarratives selected for their pencils; many, by the abstraction of\r\nmonastic seclusion, brought their souls to that pitch of devotional\r\nenthusiasm, which their pictures portray far better than words can\r\ndescribe. The biographies that remain of the early painters of Italy\r\nfully bear out this fact; and of many instances that might be given\r\nwe shall select three from various places and periods.\r\n\r\nOf the early Bolognese school, Vitale and his pupil Lippo di Dalmasio\r\nwere each designed _delle Madonne_, from their formally devoting\r\nthemselves to the exclusive representation of her\r\n\r\n     \"Who so above all mothers shone,\r\n     The mother of the Blessed One.\"\r\n\r\nSo far indeed did the latter of these carry enthusiastic mysticism,\r\nthat he never resumed his labours without purifying his imagination\r\nand sanctifying his thoughts by a vigil of austere fasting, and by\r\ntaking the blessed sacrament in the morning. In like manner did one\r\nof his comrades gain the appellation of Simon of the crucifixes. A\r\ncentury later, Gentile Bellini painted three of his noblest works for\r\na confraternity in Venice, who possessed a relic of the True Cross,\r\nand chose for his subject various miracles ascribed to its influence.\r\nRefusing all remuneration, he affixed this touching record of his\r\npious motives: \"The work of Gentile Bellini, a knight of Venice,\r\ninstigated by affection for the Cross, 1496.\" Similar anecdotes might\r\nbe quoted of Giovanni da Fiesole, better known in Italy as Beato\r\nAngelico, whose life and pencil may well be termed seraphic, and to\r\nwhom we shall again have occasion to allude; while parallel cases\r\nof a later date are found in Spain, where religion, and religious\r\nfervour, influenced by the self-mortification of dark fanatics and\r\ndismal ascetics, generally assumed less attractive forms.\r\n\r\nA Christian ideal was thus the aim of the early masters; and\r\nmost surviving works of the Umbrian and Sienese schools carry in\r\nthemselves ample evidence of intensely serious sentiment animating\r\ntheir authors. But to those who have not enjoyed opportunities of\r\nobserving this peculiar characteristic of a style of art almost\r\nunknown in England, it may be acceptable to trace the same spirit\r\nin a language legible by eyes unaccustomed to the delicacies of\r\npictorial expression. This confirmation is found in the rules\r\nadopted by guilds of painters, incorporated in different towns of\r\nItaly, which are upon this point more important, as proving how\r\nentirely devotional feeling was systematised, instead of being left\r\nto the accident of individual inspiration. The statutes of the\r\nSienese fraternity, confirmed in 1357, are thus prefaced: \"Let the\r\nbeginning, middle, and end of our words and actions be in the name of\r\nGod Almighty, and of his Mother, our Lady the Virgin Mary! Whereas\r\nwe, by the grace of God, being those who make manifest to rude and\r\nunlettered men the marvellous things effected by, and in virtue of,\r\nour holy faith; and our creed consisting chiefly in the worship and\r\nbelief of one God in Trinity, and of God omnipotent, omniscient, and\r\ninfinite in love and compassion; and as nothing, however unimportant,\r\ncan have beginning or end without these three necessary ingredients,\r\npower, knowledge, and right good-will; and as in God only consists\r\nall high perfection; let us therefore anxiously invoke the aid of\r\ndivine grace, in order that we may attain to a good beginning and\r\nending of all our undertakings, whether of word or work, prefacing\r\nall in the name and to the honour of the MOST HOLY TRINITY.\r\nAnd since spiritual things are, and should be, far preferable and\r\nmore precious than temporal, let us commence by regulating the fête\r\nof our patron, the venerable and glorious St Luke,\" &c. Several\r\nsubsequent rules relate to the observance of other festivals, whereof\r\nfifty-seven are enjoined to be strictly kept without working, a\r\nnumber which, added to Sundays and Easter holidays, monopolises for\r\nsacred purposes nearly a third of the year.[107] The Florentine\r\nstatutes, dated about twenty years earlier, direct that all who come\r\nto enrol themselves in the Company of painters, whether men or\r\nwomen, shall be penitent and confessed, or at least shall purpose\r\nto confess themselves at the earliest opportunity; that they shall\r\ndaily repeat five paternosters, and as many aves, and shall take the\r\nsacrament at least once a year.[108] Nor let these be regarded as\r\nmere unmeaning phrases, or as the vapid lip-service of a formalist\r\nfaith. The ceremonial observances of an age in which the Roman\r\nChurch was indeed Catholic cannot fairly be judged by a Protestant\r\nstandard, yet few, who have seen with intelligence the productions of\r\nthose painters, will doubt that they were men of piety and prayer.\r\nA vestige of the same holy feeling hung over artists, even after it\r\nhad ceased to animate their efforts; the forms survived, when the\r\nspirit had fled. Thus, \"On Tuesday morning, the 11th of June 1573,\r\nat eleven in the forenoon, Giorgio Vasari began to paint the cupola\r\nof the cathedral at Florence; and, before commencing, he had a Mass\r\nof the Holy Spirit celebrated at the altar of the sacrament, after\r\nhearing which he entered upon the work.\"[109] Vasari was a religious\r\nman; but the favourite painter of a dissolute court could scarcely be\r\na religious artist, nor could the pupil of Michael Angelo appreciate\r\nthe quiet pathos or feel the gentle fervour of earlier and more\r\nspiritualised times.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: _Carteggio d'Artisti_, II., p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: _Carteggio d'Artisti_, II., p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: _Ibid._, III., p. 352.]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, where art was always in the especial service of the\r\npriesthood, and not unfrequently subservient to priestcraft, religion\r\nwas a requisite of painters to a much later date. The rules of the\r\nacademy established at Seville by Murillo, in 1658, imposed upon each\r\npupil an ejaculatory testimony of his faith in, and devotion for,\r\nthe blessed sacrament and immaculate conception.[110] But whilst the\r\npiety of the Sienese and Florentine guilds was an inherent sentiment\r\nof their age, willingly adopted by professional etiquette, that of\r\nthe Iberian artists in the sixteenth century was regulated by the\r\nInquisition, and savoured of its origin. The former was joyous as the\r\nbright thoughts of youthful enthusiasm springing in a land of beauty;\r\nthe latter shadowed the grave and sombre temperament of the nation\r\nby austerities congenial to the Holy Office. Hence the religious\r\npaintings of Spain, appealing to the spectator's terrors rather than\r\nto his sympathies, revelled in the horrible, eschewing as a snare\r\nthose lovely forms which in Italy were encouraged as conducive to\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: STIRLING'S _Annals of the Artists of Spain_,\r\np. 848.]\r\n\r\nYet, if the genius of early painters was hampered, and the effect\r\nof their creations impaired, by prescribed symbols and conventional\r\nrules, they were not without countervailing advantages. A limited\r\nrange of forms did not always imply poverty of ideas, nor was\r\nsimplicity inconsistent with sublimity. Those, accordingly, who look\r\nwith intelligence upon pictures, which, to the casual glance of an\r\nuninformed spectator, are mere rude and monstrous representations,\r\nwill often recognise in them a grandeur of sentiment, and a majesty\r\nof expression, altogether wanting in more matured productions,\r\nwherein truth to nature is manifested through unimportant\r\naccessories, or combined with trivial details. Familiarity is\r\nnotoriously conducive to contempt; and to associate the grander\r\nthemes and dogmas of holy writ with multiplied adjuncts skilfully\r\nborrowed from ordinary life, is to detract from the awe and mystery\r\nwhereof they ought to be especially suggestive.\r\n\r\nBut here it may be well to premise that, our observations upon\r\nChristian art being purely æsthetical, it forms no part of our plan\r\nto analyse its influences in a doctrinal view, or to discuss the\r\nRoman system of teaching religion to the laity, by attracting them\r\nto devotional observances through pictures and sculpture, to the\r\nexclusion of the holy scriptures; still less to raise any controversy\r\nregarding the incidents or tenets thus usually inculcated. We,\r\ntherefore, pause not to inquire how far the Roman legends--often\r\nbeautifully suggestive of truth, but how frequently redolent of fatal\r\nerror!--have originated in art, or been corrupted by its creations.\r\nOne danger of teaching by pictures is obvious; for where the eye\r\nis offered but a few detached scenes, without full explanation of\r\ntheir attendant circumstances and connecting links, very imperfect\r\nimpressions and false conclusions may result. Under such a system,\r\nfigurative representation will often be literally interpreted,\r\nsymbols will be mistaken for facts, dreams for realities; and thus\r\nhave the fertile imaginations of artists and commentators mutually\r\nreacted upon each other, until historical and spiritual truth is\r\nlost in a maze of allegory and fable, and error has been indelibly\r\ningrafted upon popular faith. The dim allegories of early art have\r\naccordingly been overlaid by crude inventions, or obscured by gross\r\nignorance and enthusiastic mysticism. Religious truth being thus\r\nmisstated, or its symbols misread, those who thirsted for the waters\r\nof life were repelled by tainted streams, and hungry souls were\r\nmocked by stones for bread. It ought, however, to be constantly borne\r\nin mind that we are dealing with times when the authority of Rome was\r\nabsolute throughout Europe; and that, whatever may now be alleged\r\nagainst the dogmas or legends embodied by early artists, they were\r\nthen universally received. For our purpose they ought, therefore,\r\nto be examined by the light then enjoyed, not by that shed upon\r\nthem in after times of gospel freedom. Neither ought we to forget\r\nthe impressionable qualities of a southern people, when disposed to\r\nquestion the tendencies of religious instruction through the senses\r\nand the imagination. And, granting that it is well to employ such\r\nmeans, the mute eloquence of an altar-picture, or a reliquary, though\r\nless startling than impassioned pulpit appeals, less thrilling than\r\nchoral voices sustained by the organ's impressive diapason, had the\r\nadvantages of being accessible at all hours to devout visitors, and\r\nof demanding from them no sustained attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch was Christian art in Italy during the fourteenth century, when\r\nit was destined to undergo very considerable modifications. As yet\r\nit had been exercised almost exclusively for decorating churches\r\nand monastic buildings with extensive works intended to nourish or\r\nrevive devotion in the masses who resorted to them. In ages when the\r\nintelligence capable of ordering these works was almost limited to\r\nconvents, and when it was only from such representations that the\r\nunlettered eye could convey impressions to the mind of the laity,\r\nChristian paintings were an effective adjunct to Christian preaching\r\nand devotional exercises. But, as the dark cloud began to roll away\r\nbefore the dawn of modern cultivation, mankind awoke to new wants. No\r\nlonger content with the pittance of religious knowledge which their\r\nspiritual guides doled out to them, they sought to secure a store for\r\ntheir own uncontrolled use. Those who could vanquish the difficulties\r\nof reading, found in their office-books a continuation of the church\r\nservices; the less educated placed by their bed, or in their domestic\r\nchapel, a small devotional picture, as a substitute for the larger\r\nrepresentations which invoked them to holy feelings in the house\r\nof God. Thus there arose a general desire for objects of sacred\r\nart. The privilege assumed by all who wished for such, of ordering\r\nthem in conformity with their individual feelings or superstitions,\r\nquickly introduced greater latitudinarianism as to the selection\r\nand treatment of the subjects. The demand so created exceeded the\r\nproductive powers of such painters as had been regularly initiated\r\ninto the language of form, according to the settled conventionalities\r\nof their sanctified profession. The chain of pictorial tradition was\r\nsnapped, when a host of new competitors entered the field, free from\r\nits trammels. But the public taste had been too long and thoroughly\r\nimbued with a uniform class of religious compositions to relish any\r\ngreat innovations; and although historical painting began to find\r\na place in the palace-halls of the princes and republics of Italy,\r\nworks commissioned by private persons continued almost exclusively of\r\na sacred cast. Thus for a time was the new path little frequented.\r\nArtists felt their way with caution, unaware of the direction\r\nwhither it might lead them; timid of their own powers, doubtful of\r\ntheir influence on the public. They contented themselves at first\r\nwith enlarging the range of subjects, or with varying the pose of\r\nthe actors. Fearing to abandon traditional types, they ventured not\r\nbeyond the addition of accessories, such as architecture, landscape,\r\nanimals, fruits, and flowers, or a disposal of the draperies with\r\ngreater freedom and attention to truth. But, the further they\r\ndeparted from received forms, the more willingly did their genius\r\npluck by the way those graceful aids and appliances which spontaneous\r\nnature offered in a land of beauty; and every new combination which\r\nthat awakened genius inspired, induced, and to a certain extent\r\nauthorised, fresh novelties.\r\n\r\nThe modifications thus introduced have been distinguished in modern\r\nphrase by the term naturalism, in contradistinction to those\r\ntraditional forms and spiritualised countenances which constitute\r\nthe mysticism of mediæval art. It would lead us too far from\r\nour subject to trace the progress of naturalism from such early\r\nsymptoms as we have indicated, until portraits, at first interponed\r\nas donors of the picture, or as spectators of its incident, were\r\nhabitually selected as models for the most sacred personages. That\r\nthe adaptation of nature to the highest purposes of art, by skilful\r\nselection and by judicious idealisation, is the noblest object which\r\npictorial genius can keep in view for its inventions will scarcely\r\nbe contested. But another consideration, inherent in the axioms of\r\nthe mystic school, was too often lost sight of by the naturalists.\r\nThe portraiture of criminal or even vulgar life, in deeply religious\r\nworks, is an outrage upon all holy feeling, whether in the example of\r\nAlexander VI., who commanded Pinturicchio to introduce into one of\r\nthe Vatican frescoes his own portrait, kneeling before the ascending\r\nRedeemer;[111] or in the case of those painters in Rome whose\r\nfavourite model for the Saviour has of late years been a cobbler,\r\nhence known in the streets by the blasphemous name of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Roscoe, who wrote without an opportunity of seeing\r\nthese paintings, describes this Pope as kneeling in his pontificals\r\nbefore the Madonna, in whom is portrayed his mistress, Julia Farnese.\r\nIn this palpable blunder he has been followed by Rio and others. It\r\nwould be curious to discover on what authority Gordon, in his life\r\nof Borgia, states that a likeness of La Vanosia, another of his\r\nmistresses, hung for Madonna-worship in the church of the Popolo at\r\nRome. The circumstance coming from such a quarter is questionable; at\r\nall events, it is no longer true. Alexander kneels before the Risen,\r\nnot the Ascending Christ. *Roscoe followed Vasari.]\r\n\r\nTo the naturalism which became gradually prevalent in most Italian\r\nschools after the beginning of the fourteenth century, there was,\r\nin the fifteenth, added another principle of antagonism to mystic\r\nfeeling. In purist nomenclature it has been denominated paganism, but\r\nit seems to consist of paganism and classicism. By the former is to\r\nbe understood that fashion for the philosophy, morality, literature,\r\nand mythology of ancient Greece and Rome, which, introduced from\r\nthe recovered authors of antiquity, was assiduously cultivated by\r\nthe Medici in their lettered but sceptical court, until it left a\r\nstamp on the literature and art of Italy not yet effaced. Under its\r\ninfluence, the vernacular language was neglected, or cramped into\r\nobsolete models; dead tongues monopolised students; the doctrines of\r\nAristotle and Plato divided men, clouding their faith, and warping\r\ntheir morals from Christian standards; the beauty of holiness\r\nyielded before an ideal of form; and that unction which had purified\r\nthe conceptions and guided the pencils of devotional painters,\r\nevaporated as they strove to master the technical excellences of the\r\nnew manner. To the maxims and principles of revived pagan antiquity,\r\nthe philosophic Schlegel has traced the selfish policy and morals of\r\nItalian tyrants and communities; but it seems easier to detect their\r\nfatal tendency in painting and sculpture than upon statecraft and\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nClassicism, as here used, means that innovation of antique taste in\r\nart which arose out of renewed interest in the picturesque ruins of\r\nRome, in her mighty recollections, in the excavation of her precious\r\nsculptures, and which imparted to pictorial representations sometimes\r\na hard and plastic treatment, sometimes ornamental architecture,\r\nbas-reliefs, or grotesques. By paganism a blighting poison was\r\ninfused through the spirit of art, while classicism has often\r\nennobled the work and enriched its details, without injury to its\r\nsentiment. To schools such as those of Florence and Padua, wherein\r\nnature or classic imitation prevailed, there belonged the materialism\r\nof facts, the severity of definite forms.[*112] These qualities\r\nobtained favour from men of mundane pursuits and literary tastes;\r\nfrom citizens greedy after gainful commerce and devoted to political\r\nintrigue; or from princes who patronised, and pedants who deciphered,\r\nlong forgotten, but at length reviving lore. The \"new manner,\" as\r\nit was called, had, in Michael Angelo, a supporter whose mighty\r\ngenius lent to its solecisms an irresistible charm. Yet against such\r\ninnovations protests were long occasionally recorded. An anonymous\r\nwriter, in 1549, mentions a _Pietà_, said to have been designed\r\nby \"Michael Angelo Buonarroti, that inventor of filthy trash, who\r\nadheres to art without devotion. Indeed, all the modern painters and\r\nsculptors, following the like Lutheran [that is, impious] caprices\r\nnow-a-days, neither paint nor model for consecrated churches anything\r\nbut figures that distract one's faith and devotion; but I hope that\r\nGod will one day send his saints to cast down such idolatries.\"[113]\r\nIn a land where mythology had slowly been supplanted by revelation,\r\nespecially in a city successively the capital of paganism and\r\nChristianity, these influences were necessarily in frequent\r\nantagonism, or in forced and unseemly juxtaposition. Whilst art\r\nthus lost in sentiment, it gained in vigour; and although classic\r\ntaste and the study of antique sculpture unquestionably tarnished\r\nits mystical purity, may they not have preserved it from the fate\r\nof religious painting in Spain, which, debarred by the Inquisition\r\nfrom access to nude models, and elevated by no refined standard,\r\noscillated between the extremes of gloomy asceticism and grovelling\r\nvulgarity? The paganism of the Medici and Michael Angelo scared away\r\nthe seraphic visions of monastic limners, but it also rescued Italy\r\nfrom religious prudery, and saved men from addressing their orisons\r\nto squalid beggars.[*114]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *112: For instance, in the work of Botticelli, I suppose,\r\nor Verrocchio, or Mantegna?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: GAYE, _Carteggio_, II., 500.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *114: Can this be an allusion to S. Francesco of Assisi?]\r\n\r\nThe brief sketch which we have thus introduced of the progress\r\nand tendency of Christian art, may be fittingly concluded by the\r\ndefinition of it supplied by Baron v. Rumohr, one of the laborious,\r\nlearned, and felicitous expositors of mediæval art whom the reviving\r\ntaste of later times produced. \"It is consecrated to religion alone;\r\nits object is sometimes to induce the mind to the contemplation of\r\nsacred subjects, sometimes to regulate the passions, by awakening\r\nthose sentiments of peace and benevolence which are peculiar to\r\npractical Christianity.\" To narrate its extinction in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, speedily followed by the decline of all that was noblest in\r\nartistic genius, is a task on which we are not now called to enter.\r\nWe approached the subject because, in the mountains of Umbria, that\r\nmystic school long maintained its chief seat; because there its\r\ntypes sank deepest into the popular mind; and because it reached its\r\nculminating point of perfection and glory in RAFFAELE of\r\nURBINO.\r\n\r\nWe are fully and painfully aware how opposed some of these views\r\nare to the received criticism and popular practice of art in\r\nEngland; but it were beyond our purpose to inquire into the many\r\ncauses which combine to render our countrymen averse from the\r\nimpartial study, as well as to the even partial adoption of them.\r\nHogarth, the incarnation of our national taste in painting, saw in\r\nthose spiritualised cherubim which usually minister to the holiest\r\ncompositions of the Umbrian school, only \"an infant's head with a\r\npair of duck's wings under its chin, supposed always to be flying\r\nabout and singing psalms.\"[115] The form conveyed by the eye, and the\r\ndescription of it traced by the pen, are here in accurate unison.\r\nAlas! how hopelessly blinded the writer's mental vision. As directly\r\nopposed to such grovelling views, and contrasting spiritual with\r\nmaterial perceptions of art, it may not be out of place here to cite\r\na passage from Savonarola, whose stern genius gladly invoked the muse\r\nof painting to aid his moral and political reformations. \"Creatures\r\nare beautiful in proportion as they participate in and approximate\r\nthe beauty of their creator; and perfection of bodily form is\r\nrelative to beauty of mind. Bring hither two women equally perfect in\r\nperson; let one be a saint, the other a sinner. You shall find that\r\nthe saint will be more generally loved than the sinner, and that on\r\nher all eyes will be directed.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Our reference to this quotation (made long ago) has\r\nbeen mislaid, but it appears perfectly consistent with Hogarth's\r\nhabitual train of ideas, and quaint rendering of them. See\r\nIRELAND'S _Hogarth Illustrated_, I., p. lxix.; II., p. 194,\r\n195; III., p. 226-40. NICHOL'S _Anecdotes of Hogarth_, p.\r\n137. In his plate of Enthusiasm Delineated, he has actually appended\r\na pair of duck's legs to a cherub.]\r\n\r\nThese quotations illustrate two extremes,--ribald vulgarity on\r\nthe one hand, and transcendental mysticism on the other, between\r\nwhich the standard of sound criticism may be sought. It would be\r\nas unreasonable to suppose Hogarth capable of comprehending or\r\nappreciating the fervid conceptions of Christian art, as to look\r\nfor sympathy from Savonarola, with his pot-house personifications.\r\nEach of those styles has its peculiar merit, which cannot fairly be\r\nconsidered with reference to the other: they differ in this among\r\nmany respects,--that whilst English caricatures and Dutch familiar\r\nscenes are addressed to the most uncultivated minds, Umbrian or\r\nSienese paintings can be understood only after long examination and\r\nelevated thought. The former, therefore, gratify the unintelligent\r\nmany, the latter delight an enlightened few.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of justly appreciating this branch of æsthetics is\r\ngreater among ourselves than is generally imagined, as our best\r\nauthorities have entirely misled us, from themselves overlooking\r\nits true bent. More alive to the naturalism and technical merits\r\nof painting than to subtleties of feeling and expression, they are\r\nneither conscious of the aims nor aware of the principles of purist\r\nart. They look for perfection where only pathos should be sought.\r\nBurnet, a recent and valuable writer, considers Barry \"one of those\r\nnoble minds ruined by a close adherence to the dry manner of the\r\nearly masters,\" an analogy which cannot but surprise those who\r\ncompare the respective works of those thus brought unconsciously into\r\ncontrast. Even Sir Joshua Reynolds was not exempt from prejudice on\r\nthis point, for he sneers at the first manner of Raffaele as \"dry\r\nand insipid,\" and avers that until Masaccio, art was so barbarous,\r\n\"that every figure appeared to stand upon his toes.\" There is but one\r\nexplanation applicable to assertions thus inconsistent at once with\r\nfact and with sound criticism, in a writer so candid and generally\r\nso careful. Living in an age devoid of Catholic feeling (we employ\r\nthe phrase in an æsthetic sense), which classed in the same category\r\nof contempt all painting before Michael Angelo, and speaking of\r\n\"an excellence addressed to a faculty which he did not possess,\"\r\nhe assumed, without observation or inquiry, that \"the simplicity\r\nof the early masters would be better named penury, as it proceeds\r\nfrom mere want,--from want of knowledge, want of resources, want\r\nof abilities to be otherwise; that it was the offspring, not of\r\nchoice, but of necessity.\" No argument is required to convince those\r\nwho have impartially studied these masters, that a condemnation so\r\nsweeping is erroneous. In our day, the number of such persons is\r\nhappily increasing, but there are still many impediments to a candid\r\nappreciation of the subject. So long as art was the handmaid of\r\nreligion, its professors were ranked almost with those who ministered\r\nin the temple, and interpreted the records of inspiration. In absence\r\nof priests, their works became guides to popular devotion, and\r\nconsequently were addressed to spectators who came to worship, not\r\nto criticise; whose credulous enthusiasm was nourished by yearnings\r\nof the heart, not by the cold judgment of the eye. How different the\r\ntest applied by men who look upon such paintings as popish dogmas\r\nwhich it is a duty to repudiate, it may be to ridicule! How futile\r\nthe perhaps more common error of trying them by the matured rules\r\nof pictorial execution, apart from their object and intention!\r\nConnoisseurship in painting, especially in England, has indeed too\r\nlong consisted in a mere appreciation of its technical difficulties,\r\nand perception of their successful treatment. For it was not until\r\nRaffaele had attained grace, and Michael Angelo had mastered\r\ndesign,--until Correggio had blended light and shade into happy\r\neffect, and Titian had taught the gorgeous hues of his palette to\r\nmingle in harmony, that such perfections were looked for, or reduced\r\nto a standard. Why, then, apply such standard to works already old\r\nere it had been adopted? The very imperfections of general treatment,\r\nthe absence of linear perspective and anatomical detail, tended to\r\ndevelop what should be chiefly sought and most valued in these early\r\nproductions; for the artist's time was thus free to elaborate the\r\nheads and extremities, until he gave them that grace and expression\r\nwhich constitutes their interest and their charm.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, no longer wanting writers in England, as well as\r\nin Germany, France, and Italy, to appreciate their lofty motives,\r\nand solemn feelings, and gentle forms. In the words of Ruskin,\r\nwhose earnest and true thoughts are often most happily expressed,\r\n\"the early efforts of Cimabue and Giotto are the burning messages\r\nof prophecy, delivered by the stammering lips of infants,\" but they\r\nare unintelligible to \"the multitude, always awake to the lowest\r\npleasures which art can bestow, and dead to the highest,\" for\r\ntheir beauties \"can only be studied or accepted in the particular\r\nfeeling that produced them.\" Under the modest title of _Sketches_\r\nLord Lindsay has enriched our literature with the best history of\r\nChristian art as yet produced. He has brought to his task that\r\nsincerity of purpose, veneration for sacred things, and lively\r\nsense of beauty, which impart a charm to all he puts forth; and he\r\nhas peculiarly qualified himself for its successful performance,\r\nby an anxious study of preceding writers, by a faithful, often\r\ntoilsome, examination of monuments, even in the more obscure sites\r\nof Italy, and by a candour and accuracy of criticism seldom attained\r\non topics singularly liable to prejudice. Public intelligence and\r\ntaste must improve under such direction, notwithstanding passing\r\nsneers at \"his narrow notions of admiring the faded and soulless\r\nattempts at painting of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\"\r\nor sapient conclusions that \"the antiquities and curiosities of\r\nthe early Italian painters would only infect our school with a\r\nretrograding mania of disfiguring art, and returning to the decrepit\r\nlittleness of a period warped and tortured by monkish legends and\r\nprejudices.\"[116] In order to be comprehended, such \"curiosities\"\r\nmust not only be seen, but studied maturely: both are in this country\r\nalike impracticable. When Wilkie first entered Italy, he found\r\nnothing to rank them above Chinese or Hindoo paintings,[*117] and\r\ncould not discern the majestic simplicity ascribed to the primitive\r\nmasters. Yet, ere six weeks had passed, he recorded the conviction\r\n\"that the only art pure and unsophisticated, and that is worth study\r\nand consideration by an artist, or that has the true object of art in\r\nview, is to be found in the works of those masters who revived and\r\nimproved the art, and those who ultimately brought it to perfection.\r\nThese alone seem to have addressed themselves to the common sense of\r\nmankind. From Giotto to Michael Angelo, expression and sentiment seem\r\nthe first thing thought of, whilst those who followed seem to have\r\nallowed technicalities to get the better of them, until, simplicity\r\ngiving way to intricacy, they seem to have painted more for the\r\nartist and the connoisseur than for the untutored apprehensions of\r\nordinary men.\" So, too, in writing to Mr. Phillips, R.A., he\r\nsays, \"respect for primitive simplicity and expression is perhaps the\r\nbest advice for any school.\"[118]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: _Art Union_, January and April, 1847. We have read\r\nwith regret, in a periodical justly entitled to great weight,\r\ncriticisms so at variance with its wonted candour and good sense.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *117: Evidently Chinese and Japanese art were not\r\nunderstood in England in 1859.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: CUNNINGHAM'S _Life of Wilkie_, II., pp. 197,\r\n506.]\r\n\r\nNeither are religious innovations a necessary accompaniment of\r\nsuch tastes among ourselves, as is too generally supposed. The\r\npresent reaction in favour of Romanist views, prevalent in England\r\namong a class of persons, many of whom are distinguished by high\r\nand cultivated intellect, as well as by youthful enthusiasm, takes\r\nnaturally an æsthetic as well as theological direction. The faith\r\nand discipline, which they labour to revive, having borrowed some\r\nwinning illustrations and much imposing pageantry from painting,\r\nsculpture, and architecture, their neophytes gladly avail themselves\r\nof accessories so attractive. Nor can it be doubted that the same\r\nqualities which render such persons impressionable to popish\r\nobservances, predispose them to admire or imitate works of devotional\r\nart. Yet there is no compulsory connection between these tendencies.\r\nConversion to pantheism is not a requisite for appreciating the\r\nBelvidere Apollo or the Medicean Venus; and a serious Christian may\r\nsurely appreciate the feeling of the early masters, without bowing\r\nthe knee to their Madonnas,--may admire the\r\n\r\n     \"Prelibations, foretastes high,\"\r\n\r\nof Fra Angelico's pencil, whilst demurring to the miracles he has so\r\ncharmingly portrayed.\r\n\r\nThere is another observation of Wilkie's which merits our notice:\r\n\"Could their system serve, which I think it may, as the border\r\nminstrelsy did Sir Walter Scott, it would be to any student a most\r\nadmirable groundwork for a new style of art.\" This somewhat hasty\r\nhint must be cautiously received. The very absence of technical\r\nexcellence interests us in the formal compositions and flat\r\nsurfaces of the early masters. We feel that movement and distance,\r\nforeshortening and relief, symmetry and contrast, tone and effect,\r\nare scarcely wanted, where \"a truth of actuality is fearlessly\r\nsacrificed to a truth of feeling.\" We are forced to admit that men\r\nwho regarded form but as the vehicle of expression, attained a severe\r\ngrandeur, a noble repose, very different from exaggerated action.\r\nArchaisms of style are, however, ill suited to our times. Originally\r\nsignificant, they are now an affectation--the offspring of penury or\r\nperverted taste, rather than of spiritual purity. So must they seem\r\nin modern productions, affectedly divested of the artificial means\r\nand improved methods which centuries of progress have developed, by\r\nartists who forget their academic studies and neglect the contour of\r\nthe living model, without attaining the old inspiration. The spirit\r\nwhich animated devotional limners being long dead, any imitation\r\nof their style must be mechanical--a reproduction of its mannerism\r\nafter its motives are extinct. Whilst, therefore, I endeavour to\r\npoint out the merits of the old religious limners, it is with no\r\nwish to see their manner revived. Among a generation whose faith\r\nhas been remodelled, whose social and intellectual habits have been\r\nentirely revolutionised, the restoration of purist painting would be\r\na mockery. But it should not, therefore, be forbidden us to study\r\nand sympathise with forms which, though rigid and monotonous, were\r\nsufficient to express the simple faith of early times, and in which\r\nearnestness compensates the absence of skill, and fervour the lack of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the thirteenth century, there appeared on\r\nthe lofty Apennines of Central Italy, one of those mysterious beings\r\nwho, with few gifts of nature, are born to sway mankind; whose brief\r\nand eccentric career has left behind a brilliant halo, that no lapse\r\nof time is likely to dim. Giovanni Bernardoni, better known as St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi, by his eloquence, his austerities, and all the\r\nappliances of religious enthusiasm, quickly gathered among the fervid\r\nspirits of his native mountains a numerous following of devoted\r\ndisciples. In a less judicious church, he might, as a field-preacher,\r\nhave become a most dangerous schismatic; but, with that foresight\r\nand knowledge of human nature which have generally distinguished the\r\nRomish hierarchy, the sectarian leader was welcomed as a missionary,\r\n\"seraphic all in fervency,\" and in due time canonised into a saint,\r\nwhilst his poverty-professing sect was recognised as an order, and\r\nbecame one of the most influential pillars of the Papacy.\r\n\r\nIt was\r\n\r\n                             \"On the hard rock\r\n     'Twixt Arno and the Tiber, he from Christ\r\n     Took the last signet.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the desolate fastnesses of Lavernia, which witnessed his ascetic\r\nlife and ecstatic visions, to the fertile slopes of Assisi, where\r\nhis bones found repose from self-inflicted hardships, the people\r\nrallied round him while alive, and revered him when dead. Nor did the\r\nreligious revival which his preaching and example there effected pass\r\naway. Acknowledged by popes, favoured by princes, his order rapidly\r\nspread. In every considerable town convents of begging friars were\r\nestablished and endowed. Still, it was in his mountain-land that\r\nhis doctrines took deepest root, among a race of simple men, reared\r\namid the sublime combinations of Alpine and forest scenery, familiar\r\nfrom their days of dreamy youth with hills and glades, caverns and\r\nprecipices, shady grottoes and solitary cells. The visionary tales\r\nof his marvellous life, penetrating the devotional character of the\r\ninhabitants, became favourite themes of popular superstition.\r\n\r\n                             \"A spirit hung,\r\n     Beautiful region! o'er thy towns and farms;\r\n     And emanations were perceived, and acts\r\n     Of immortality, in nature's course\r\n     Exemplified by mysteries, that were felt\r\n     As bonds on grave philosopher imposed,\r\n     And armed warrior; and in every grove\r\n     A gay or pensive tenderness prevailed.\"[119]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: WORDSWORTH'S _Excursion_.]\r\n\r\nAssisi in particular was the focus of the new faith. To its shrine\r\nflocked pilgrims laden with riches, which the saint taught them\r\nto despise. This influx of treasure had the usual destination of\r\nmonastic wealth, being chiefly dedicated to the decoration of its\r\nsanctuary. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the best\r\nartists in Italy competed for its embellishment, and even now it\r\nis there that the student of mediæval art ought most to seek for\r\nenlightenment.\r\n\r\nWith the legends of St. Francis thus indelibly stamped on the\r\ninhabitants, and with the finest specimens of religious painting\r\npreserved at Assisi, it need scarcely be matter of surprise that\r\ndevotional art, which we have endeavoured to describe, should have\r\nfound in Umbria a fostering soil, even after it had been elsewhere\r\nsupplanted by naturalist and pagan novelties; for the feelings which\r\nit breathed were those of mystery and sentiment--its beauty was\r\nsanctified and impalpable. By a people so trained, its traditional\r\ntypes were received with the fervour of faith; while to the limited\r\nrange of its themes the miraculous adventures of the saint were\r\na welcome supplement. The romantic character of these incidents\r\nborrowed from the picturesque features of the country a new but\r\nfitting element of pictorial effect, and for the first time nature\r\nwas introduced to embellish without demeaning religious painting. But\r\nlet us hear Rio, the eloquent elucidator of sacred art, upon this\r\nsubject. \"To the Umbrian school belongs the glory of having followed\r\nout the leading aim of Christian art without pause, and without\r\nyielding to the seductions of example or the distractions of clamour.\r\nIt would seem that a peculiar blessing belongs to the spots rendered\r\nspecially holy by the sainted Francis of Assisi, and that the odour\r\nof his sanctity has preserved the fine arts from degradation in that\r\nmountain district, where so many pious painters have successively\r\ncontributed to ornament his tomb. From thence rose to heaven, like\r\na sweet incense, prayers whose fervour and purity ensured their\r\nefficacy: from thence, too, in other times, there descended, like\r\nbeneficent dew upon the more corrupt cities of the plain, penitential\r\ninspirations that spread into almost every part of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nSince these pages were written I have met with a passage in the\r\nintroduction of Boni's Italian translation of the work just quoted,\r\nwhich I subjoin, at the risk of some repetition, as a fair specimen\r\nof the ideas on Christian art now entertained by many on the\r\nContinent, but as yet little known to English literature.\r\n\r\n\"On the Umbrian mountains, by Assisi, slept, in the peace of Heaven,\r\nSt. Francis, who left such sweet odour of sanctity in the middle\r\nages. Round his tomb assembled, from every part of Christendom,\r\npilgrims to pay their vows. With their offertories there was erected\r\nover his grave a magnificent temple, which became the point of\r\nconcourse to all painters animated by Christian feeling, who thus\r\ndisplayed their gratitude to the Almighty for their endowment of\r\ngenius, who in that solitude laid in a new store of inspiration,\r\nand who, after leaving on these walls a testimony of their powers,\r\nreturned home joyful and enriched. Cimabue, among the first that\r\nraised a holy war against the Byzantine mannerism,[*120] there\r\npainted the most beautiful of his Madonnas; his pupil, the shepherd\r\nof Bondone, there traced those simple histories which established\r\nhis superiority; thither sped the artists of Siena, Perugia, Arezzo,\r\nand the best of the Florentines,--the beatified Fiesole, of angelic\r\nlife and works, Benozzo Gozzoli, Orcagna, Perugino, and, finally,\r\nRaffaele, the greatest of painters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *120: Cimabue raising a holy war against Byzantine\r\nmannerism is an amusing spectacle. All we know of him was that his\r\npupil was a great painter. Whether or no he painted at Assisi it is\r\nimpossible to say.]\r\n\r\n\"Thus was there formed in the shadow of that sanctuary a truly\r\nChristian school, which sought its types of beauty in the heavens;\r\nor, when it laid the scene of its compositions here below, selected\r\ntheir subjects from the sainted ones of the earth. Its delight was\r\nto represent, now the Virgin-Mother kneeling before her Son, or\r\nseated caressing or holding him up for the veneration of patriarchs\r\nand saints; now the life of Christ, his preaching, his sufferings,\r\nhis triumph; or, again, to embody the touching legends told in these\r\nsimple times, or the martyrs crucified by early tyrants, or an\r\nanchorite's devotion in a lonely cave, or some beatified soul borne\r\naway on seraph's wings; or a religious procession, the miracle of a\r\npreacher, the solemnity of a sacrament: but ever, images of solace\r\nand of hope, cherubs singing and making melody, maidens contemplating\r\nwith smiles the opening heavens, the scenes begun on earth but\r\ncontinued far beyond the clouds, where the Madonna and the Saviour\r\nare seen, radiant with serene exultation, beholding the concourse of\r\nsuppliant faithful beneath.\"\r\n\r\nBut lest, in quoting from writers zealously devoted to the Roman\r\nCreed, we may seem to admit that such sympathies belong not to\r\nProtestant breasts, it will be well to appeal to one whose pen\r\nhas, with no common success, combated the usages wherein popery\r\nmost startles those whose faith is based on the Reformation. \"I\r\nnever looked at the pictures of one of these men that it did not\r\ninstantaneously affect me, alluring me into a sort of dream or\r\nreverie, while my imagination was called into very lively activity.\r\nIt is not that their drawing is good; for, on the other hand,\r\nit is often stiff, awkward, and unnatural. Nor is it that their\r\nimagination, as exhibited in grouping their figures or embodying\r\nthe story to be represented, was correct or natural; for often\r\nit is most absurd and grotesque. But still there is palpably the\r\nembodiment of an idea; an idea pure, holy, exquisite, and too much\r\nso to seem capable of expression by the ordinary powers either of\r\nlanguage or of the pencil. Yet the idea is there. And it must have\r\nhad a mysterious and wondrous power on the imagination of these men,\r\nit must have thoroughly mastered and possessed them, or they never\r\ncould have developed such an exquisite ideal of calm, peaceful, meek,\r\nheavenly holiness, as stands out so constantly and so pre-eminently\r\nin their paintings.\" In noticing the cavils of connoisseurs upon\r\nthese paintings this author happily observes, that they were \"looking\r\nfor earthly creatures and found heavenly ones; and, expecting unholy\r\nexpressions, were disappointed at finding none but the holy.\"[121]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: REV. M.H. SEYMOUR'S _Pilgrimage to Rome_, a\r\nwork remarkable for accurate observation of facts, and the candid\r\ntone of its strictures.]\r\n\r\nWe may here remark, in passing, the nearly coeval introduction of a\r\nclass of themes which, though innovating upon the purity of Catholic\r\nfaith, were admirably adapted to develop the mystic tendencies of\r\ndevotional painting. It was about the thirteenth century that the\r\nMadonna acquired the unfortunately paramount place in the Romish\r\nworship she has since been permitted to hold. Her history became a\r\nfavourite topic of Franciscan and other popular preachers, at once\r\nfacile and fascinating. Not content with describing the scriptural\r\nevents of her life, they adopted traditions regarding her birth,\r\nmarriage, and death; or the more abstruse and questionable legends\r\nof her miraculous conception, her assumption, exaltation, and her\r\ncoronation as queen of heaven, and the _cintola_ or girdle by which\r\nshe drew up souls from limbo. It would be quite foreign to the\r\nmatter in hand were we to examine the orthodoxy of these devotional\r\nnovelties, or their influence upon the social estimate of the\r\nfemale character. Enough to observe that they speedily enriched\r\nChristian art in all its branches, but chiefly in Umbria, where, in\r\naccordance with the prevailing popular taste, such of them as partook\r\nof dogmatic mystery gained a preference over more real or scenic\r\nincidents. The early Giottists were wont to close their dramatic\r\ndelineations of her earthly history with a peaceful death, its only\r\nartistic licence being the transit of her soul in the shape of a\r\nswaddled babe. But the Madonna-worship of this more spiritual school\r\nwas satisfied with nothing short of her translation in the body,\r\ndirect to realms of bliss from amid a concourse of adoring disciples.\r\nIn like manner, the old Byzantine painters inscribed over her image\r\none uniform epigraph, \"the Mother of God\"; whilst the devotional\r\nmasters delighted to seat her beyond the skies, where her blessed\r\nSon placed a diadem upon her brows as the queen of heaven. It hence\r\nbecame an established practice of the latter to depict her charms,\r\nnot after the mould in which nature cast fair but frail humanity, but\r\nto clothe them in abstract and purer beauty appropriate to one whom,\r\nthough incarnate, they were taught to regard as divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n     The Umbrian school of painting, its scholars and\r\n     influence--Fra Angelico da Fiesole--Gentile da\r\n     Fabriano--Pietro Perugino--Artists at Urbino--Piero della\r\n     Francesca--Fra Carnevale--Francesco di Giorgio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Umbrian art, of which we have attempted to trace the origin,\r\nhas not hitherto met with the notice which it merits. Lanzi allowed\r\nit no separate place among the fourteen schools under which he has\r\narranged Italian painting, and, by scattering its most important\r\nnames, has lost sight of certain characteristics which, rather\r\nthan any common education, link its masters together. Nor was this\r\nomission wonderful, for the Umbrian painters and their works were\r\ndispersed over many towns and villages, none of which could be\r\nconsidered the head-quarters of a school, and to visit these distant\r\nlocalities would have been a task of difficulty and disappointment.\r\nThe patronage of princes and communities seems to have been sparingly\r\nbestowed in that mountain-land. Assisi, adorned by many Florentine\r\nstrangers, was mother rather than nurse of its native art, and\r\nother religious houses wanted the means or the spirit to follow her\r\nbrilliant example. Hence the comparatively few opportunities afforded\r\nto the Christian painters of Umbria of executing great works in\r\nfresco, the peculiar vehicle of pictorial grandeur; and alas! of\r\nthese few, a considerable proportion has been lost to us under the\r\nbarbarism of whitewash.[122] The revival of feeling for religious\r\nart, of late commenced by the Germans, and their persevering zeal in\r\nillustrating its neglected monuments, have established the existence\r\nof an Umbrian school in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; but\r\nits history remains to be written.[*123] The task would carry us too\r\nfar from the leading subject of these volumes, yet we shall endeavour\r\nin a few pages to sketch its development, from the dreamy anchorites\r\nwhose rude pencils embodied the visions of their favourite St.\r\nFrancis, to Raffaele, whose high mission it was to perfect devotional\r\npainting,[*124] apart from the alloy of human passions, and to\r\nwithstand for a time that influx of pagan and naturalist corruptions,\r\nwhich after his premature death overwhelmed it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: In 1843, I saw fragments of fine frescoes in two\r\nchurches at Cagli which had just been cleared of this abomination;\r\nand I was assured that the small church of Monte l'Abbate near Pesaro\r\nhas but recently been subjected to it, by order of its ignorant\r\ncurate. The abbey church of Pietra Pertusa at the Furlo is another of\r\nmany similar instances.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *123: It still remains to be written; but see the Essay of\r\nBERENSON, _Central Italian Painting_ (Putnams, 1904), and\r\nthe valuable list of pictures appended to it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *124: This is an example of the taste of our fathers,\r\nalmost inexplicable to-day. To consider Raffaele as a greater\r\n\"devotional\" painter than Duccio, Simone Martini, Fra Angelico,\r\nSassetta, or Perugino might almost seem impossible.]\r\n\r\nTwo fanes were commenced in the thirteenth century near the Tiber,\r\nwhich became conspicuous as shrines equally of Christian devotion\r\nand Christian art. The cathedral of Orvieto for two hundred years\r\nattracted from all parts of Italy many of the best artificers in\r\nsculpture and painting, some of whom, arriving from Umbria, carried\r\nback new inspirations to their homes. The sanctuary of St. Francis,\r\nat Assisi, coeval with the dawn of Italian art, borrowed its earliest\r\nembellishments from Tuscany,[*125] where Giotto and his followers\r\nwere ingrafting on design two novel ingredients--dramatic composition\r\nand allegorical allusion. The former of these elements distinguished\r\nthe Florentine from contemporary schools, and carried it beyond\r\nthem in variety and effect, preparing a way for the pictorial power\r\nwhich Raffaele and Michael Angelo perfected. To the inspirations of\r\nDante it owed the latter element, and to the enthusiastic though\r\ntardy admiration which his fellow-citizens indulged for his wildly\r\npoetical mysticism, may be ascribed the abiding impress of a tendency\r\nwhich not only authorised but encouraged new and varied combinations.\r\nThe rigid outlines, monotonous conventional movements, and soulless\r\ncountenances of Byzantium gradually were mellowed into life and\r\nbeauty; but it is curious to observe how much sooner genius caught\r\nthe spirit than the form,--how it succeeded in embodying expression\r\nlong before it could master the more technical difficulties of\r\ndesign, action, and shadow. The credit claimed for Giotto of\r\nintroducing physiognomical expression is, however, only partially\r\ntrue. Compared with the Greek works, or even with those of his\r\nimmediate antecedents, Cimabue, Guido, and Margaritone, his heads,\r\nindeed, beam with animated intelligence, and feel the movement which\r\nhe first communicated to his groups. Yet not less was the still and\r\nunimpassioned, but deep-seated emotion which the Umbrian painters\r\nembodied in their miniatures and panels, an improvement upon the\r\nlifeless and angular mechanism of the Byzantine artificers, although\r\nthese very opposite qualities are generally condemned to the same\r\ncategory of contemptible feebleness by our pretended connoisseurs,\r\nglibly discussing masters whose real works they never saw, or are\r\nunable from ignorance and prejudice to appreciate. Such a state\r\nof art could not, however, remain wedded to a few fixed types. It\r\nwas inherently one of transition, and necessarily led to a gradual\r\nabandonment of the Giottist manner of representation, while it\r\nenlarged the principles of composition introduced by Giotto. Beato\r\nAngelico, the first Florentine who successfully departed from that\r\nstyle, reawakening the old religious spirit, and embodying in it\r\nforms of purity never before or since attained, forsook not wholly\r\nthe Dantesque spirit. His passing influence yielded to a manner more\r\nin unison with the times, which was formed and nearly perfected by\r\nMasaccio; but still Dante was not left behind. Luca Signorelli,\r\nissuing from his Umbrian mountains and his Umbrian master, imbibed at\r\nFlorence the lofty images of \"the bard of hell,\" and energetically\r\nreproduced them in the duomo of Orvieto, in startling contrast with\r\nthe works of Angelico, and other devoted masters, who had previously\r\ndecorated that museum of art.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *125: The Roman school was painting at Assisi in the Upper\r\nChurch before Giotto. Cf. CROWE & CAVALCASELLE, _op. cit._,\r\nvol. II., p. 4.]\r\n\r\nThere, too, had been wrought some choice productions of the Pisan\r\nsculptors,[*126] but their tendency to clothe nature in the forms\r\nof antique design met with little sympathy, and no imitation, from\r\nstudents whose minds were preoccupied by tales of St. Francis, and\r\nthus it is unnecessary here to notice them further. The Sienese\r\nschool is in an entirely different category. Without encumbering\r\nourselves at present by the definitions and distinctions of German\r\næsthetic criticism, we shall merely remark that the painters of\r\nSiena, from Guido until late in the fifteenth century, never lost\r\nsight of that sentimental devotion which we have already described\r\nas the soul of Christian art, and which so curiously pervades the\r\nstatutes of their guild formerly quoted. The cathedral of Orvieto was\r\nfounded in 1290 by a Sienese architect, who, as we may well suppose,\r\nbrought some of his countrymen to assist in its embellishment, and\r\nto infuse these principles among the native students, who, from\r\nassistants, became master-artificers of its decorations. Nor was\r\nthis the only link which connected Sienese art with the confines\r\nof Umbria. The scattered townships in the Val di Chiana preserve\r\nin their remaining early altar-panels clear evidence that these\r\nwere supplied from Siena; and Taddeo Bartolo, repairing thence in\r\n1403 to Perugia, and perhaps to Assisi, left proofs that the bland\r\nsentimentalism of his native school might be united with a tranquil\r\nmajesty, to which the Giottists had scarcely attained.[*127]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *126: The Pisan sculptors were for the most part Maitani,\r\nthe Sienese. Cf. L. DOUGLAS, in _Architectural Review_,\r\nJune, 1903.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *127: Dennistoun says nothing of the magnificent work of\r\nSimone Martini, the Sienese, in S. Francesco, at Assisi.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly touched upon foreign influences which told on\r\nthe pictorial character of Umbria, we are prepared to consider the\r\nmost remarkable artificers whom it has produced, especially in the\r\nduchy of Urbino. Of these the first place is due on many accounts\r\nto ODERIGI DA GUBBIO,[*128] for, besides his claim to be\r\nfounder of the schools of Gubbio and Bologna, he is celebrated among\r\nthe most excellent miniaturists of his time by Dante, who has placed\r\nhim in purgatory, a sentence justly deemed by Ticozzi somewhat severe\r\nfor \"the head and front of his offending,\" that of over-zeal in his\r\nart.\r\n\r\n     \"'Art thou not Oderigi? Art not thou\r\n     Agobbio's glory, glory of that art\r\n     Which they of Paris call the limner's skill?'\r\n     'Brother,' said he, 'with tints that gayer smile,\r\n     Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves:\r\n     His all the honour now, my light obscured.\r\n     In truth I had not been thus courteous to him\r\n     The whilst I lived, though eagerness of zeal\r\n     For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.\r\n     Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid;\r\n     Nor were I even here, if, able still\r\n     To sin, I had not turned me unto God.\r\n     O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipt\r\n     E'en in its height of verdure, if an age\r\n     Less bright succeed not. Cimabue thought\r\n     To lord it over painting's field, and now\r\n     The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclipsed.'\"[129]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *128: Cf. VENTURI, _Storia dell'Arte Italiana_\r\n(Milano, 1907), vol. V., 837, 1003-4, 1014, 1022.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: CAREY'S _Dante_, Purg. XI., 76.]\r\n\r\nBaldinucci has written a life of this master, chiefly in confirmation\r\nof his theory that all modern painting was produced from the\r\npersonal influence of Cimabue, a dogma combated by Lanzi. His death\r\nis placed in 1299, which would make him contemporary with that\r\nFlorentine artificer, and Vasari calls him the friend of Giotto, who\r\nwas much his junior. The preservation of his name is perhaps chiefly\r\nowing to Dante's notice, though the antiquaries of Gubbio now reject\r\nthe lapidary inscription which claims for the latter a residence in\r\ntheir town. There is in truth a sad deficiency of facts regarding\r\nOderigi, and no work from his hand being now known, speculation as\r\nto his style would be useless.[130] That the painters connected with\r\nGubbio in the following generation may have been formed under his\r\ninstructions, is however a conjecture fairly admissible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: The Ordo Officiorum Senensis Ecclesiæ, a MS. of 1215,\r\nin the library of Siena, has been ascribed to him, by confusion\r\nwith another Oderico, a canon there; it possesses no artistic merit\r\nwhatever.]\r\n\r\nOf these Cecco and Puccio were employed, probably as mosaicists,\r\nin 1321, upon the cathedral of Orvieto, whence they may have\r\nbrought back to Umbria enlarged principles of art. But, abandoning\r\nconjectural grounds, let us notice the earliest Eugubinean painter\r\nwhose works have survived to our own time. GUIDO PALMERUCCI\r\nis said to have been born about the time of Oderigi's death, while\r\nothers consider him as his pupil. Assuredly the observation of Lanzi,\r\nwhich appears to rank him with the Giottists, is not borne out by the\r\nfrescoes in his native town attributed to him, for these have nothing\r\nof the dramatic action which Giotto introduced, and their details,\r\nas well as their general manner, resemble colossal miniatures.\r\nThis is especially the case in a figure of S. Antonio, the only\r\nremains of some mural paintings which covered the exterior of a\r\nchapel[*131] belonging to the college of painters, founded at Gubbio\r\nin the thirteenth century. The character of the saint is grand, the\r\nattitude solemn, the expression spiritualised; and an Ecce Homo still\r\nin the Church of S. Maria Nuova there, exhibits a similar style.\r\nAmong the few fragments of mouldering frescoes to be seen at Gubbio,\r\nI have found no others ascribed to Palmerucci, but Passavant tells\r\nus he wrought in the town-hall about 1345. At Cagli two interesting\r\nfrescoes in the church of S. Francesco have been lately brought to\r\nlight from behind a great altar picture, and successfully moved to\r\nthe adjoining wall. They represent two miracles of St. Anthony of\r\nPadua, and I am inclined to ascribe them to Palmerucci, or some able\r\ncontemporary. The actors and bystanders are equally remarkable for\r\nheads of staid devout composure, which under Giottesque treatment\r\nwould have been in a far higher degree animated and dramatic. In the\r\nbeautiful art of pictorial glass, Gubbio has also a notable name in\r\nANGIOLETTO, who embellished the chapel-window of St. Louis\r\nat Assisi, and enriched the cathedrals of Orvieto and Siena with his\r\ngem-like decorations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *131: He refers to S. Antonio Abate, I suppose. There is\r\nnothing by Palmerucci in S. Maria Nuova, but a Madonna and Saints and\r\nGonfaloniere kneeling are attributed to him in the Prefettura.]\r\n\r\nTo the same city belongs the little we know of the Nelli\r\nfamily,[*132] yet that little is well calculated to call forth\r\nour regrets for their lost works. MARTINO NELLI was a junior\r\ncontemporary of Palmerucci. In his fresco over the gate of\r\nS. Antonio, representing the Madonna enthroned, with elaborate\r\narchitectural accessories, there may be traced an approach to the\r\nmild devotional abstraction with which the purist Christian artists\r\ntempered the\r\n\r\n     \"Maternal lady with the virgin grace.\"\r\n\r\nBut in a smaller work of his son OTTAVIANO, the church\r\nof S. Maria Nuova possesses the very finest existing specimen of\r\nthe Umbrian school, exempt from injury or restoration. The lovely\r\nand saint-like Madonna, the seraphic choir that forms a glory\r\naround her, the Almighty crowning the \"highly favoured among women,\"\r\nhave perhaps never been equalled among the happiest embodyings of\r\ndevotional genius; nor are the rich colouring, the accessory saints,\r\nand the portraits of the Peroli family, who, in 1403, commissioned\r\nthis grand work, inferior in merit. He is supposed to have been\r\nborn about 1375, and, after executing in Assisi, Urbino, and other\r\ncircumjacent towns, works long perished, to have died in 1444. Of the\r\nmural paintings by his brother Tomaso, in S. Domenico and under the\r\nPiazzone of his native town, it is impossible to say more than\r\nthat whatever of the family inspiration may have guided his pencil\r\nhas been nearly obscured by cruel restorations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *132: Cf. MAZZATINTI, _Documenti per la storia\r\ndelle Arti a Gubbio_, in _Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_,\r\nvol. III., p. 1-48. Ottaviano was living certainly after 1444.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA DEL BELVEDERE\r\n\r\n_After the fresco by Ottaviano Nelli in S. Maria Nuova, Gubbio_]\r\n\r\nAmong the pupils of Ottaviano,\r\n\r\n     \"Who on high niche or cloister wall,\r\n     Inscribed their bright-lined lays,\"\r\n\r\nabout Gubbio, are PITALI, DOMENICO DI CECCHI, and\r\nBERNARDINO DI NANNI: to these may be added GIACOMO\r\nBEDI, a name that has escaped the historians of Italian art,\r\nby whom were painted in the church of S. Agostino four scenes in\r\nthe life of the saint, which retain a freshness and force of colour\r\nequal to any productions of the age. With these the influence of\r\nOderigi seems to have become extinct in his native town, before the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century, long ere which it had, however, been\r\ntransported elsewhere by Gentile da Fabriano, who, emerging from his\r\nApennine home, reproduced in Florence and in Rome the characteristics\r\nof that master, amid universal applause, and, carrying them to\r\nVenice, founded there the religious feeling which the Bellini,\r\nVivarini, and Cima di Conegliano sustained, imparting at the same\r\ntime that taste for luxuriant colouring which Titian brought to\r\nperfection. But, ere we turn to the school of Fabriano, we may here\r\ntranslate from the original quaint Italian a letter from Ottaviano,\r\nillustrative of the early patronage of art by the Montefeltrian\r\nfamily. No trace of the works there mentioned now remains.[133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: _Carteggio d'Artisti_, I., p. 131. Countess Caterina,\r\nto whom it is addressed, was wife of Count Guidantonio, mentioned\r\nin vol. I., p. 42. For some notices of Ottaviano, I am indebted to\r\na short account of him by Signor Luigi Bonfatti of Gubbio, whose\r\nzealous researches will, it is to be hoped, soon enable him to\r\nillustrate as it deserves the hitherto neglected art of Umbria. His\r\ntheory that Gentile was a pupil of Ottaviano may be redargued by\r\ntheir ages being nearly equal, but an examination of the surviving\r\nfrescoes at Gubbio has inclined me to believe that the former drew\r\nfrom the same school of Oderigi, as represented by the Nelli,\r\nsome of those inspirations of holy pathos, and something of that\r\nplayful brilliancy of tints, which he subsequently combined with new\r\nprinciples.]\r\n\r\n     \"To the illustrious and lofty Lady, the Lady Caterina,\r\n     Countess of Montefeltro, and my special Lady.\r\n\r\n     \"My special Lady, illustrious and lofty Madam, after due\r\n     commendation, &c. I have received your benign letter,\r\n     reminding me of the figures which I promised to make for\r\n     your Ladyship. When your servant Pietro found me, I was on\r\n     horseback, going upon certain business of my own, and so\r\n     could not well tell him all my reasons, which I now expose\r\n     to your Ladyship. When your Ladyship left Gubbio, I was, as\r\n     you know, to furnish the _palliotto_;[134] after I had done\r\n     it, I went from Gubbio to execute a small job which I had\r\n     promised above a year past; for they would wait no longer,\r\n     and I should have lost it had I not forthwith commenced.\r\n     But I trusted that your Ladyship's kindness would hold me\r\n     excused, for I counted that your commission, and that of my\r\n     Lord, your son, would be completed against your Ladyship's\r\n     return to Gubbio. In order, however, that your piety may be\r\n     satisfied, I shall set myself warmly and fervently to do it\r\n     quickly, and thus your intention will take effect. There\r\n     is no one at S.

Ambrogio, or indeed to your factor, to prepare\r\n     these things for me: but if not, I shall do my best; for\r\n     you, my special Lady, never had servant more willing to\r\n     do your Ladyship's commands than myself, and so you may\r\n     count upon me as a faithful servant to the utmost of my\r\n     power. I believe I have instructions for the work you wish\r\n     in S. Erasimo [representing] your son, my Lord, kneeling\r\n     with his servant and horse before that patron saint. Thus\r\n     I recollect everything your Ladyship wishes of me, and God\r\n     grant me grace to perform it all. Prepared for whatever\r\n     your Ladyship wills; your most faithful,\r\n\r\n     \"OTAVIANO, painter of Gubbio.\r\n\r\n     \"From Urbino, the last of June, 1434.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Palliotto was the painting or wood-carving\r\noccasionally placed on the altar-front in early times, for which a\r\nhanging of brocade or muslin was afterwards substituted.]\r\n\r\nIn a sketch having no pretensions to a history, we need not pause\r\nupon names now known only from old records, and must keep strictly to\r\nthose whose genius has left a decided impress upon the development of\r\nart in Umbria. We therefore pass over artificers belonging to various\r\ncommunities along the Apennines who appear on the rolls of Orvieto,\r\nincluding several from Fabriano. About the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the latter town boasted an ALLEGRETTO NUZIO, some\r\nof whose altar-panels may still be traced in La Marca, embodying\r\na sentimentalism of expression, combined with a richness in the\r\naccessories, which remind one strongly of the finest productions of\r\nMemmi, and lead us to suspect an infusion of the Sienese style.[*135]\r\nBut the renown of Allegretto rests more on that of his pupil\r\nGentile, whom we have already named as the first who carried the\r\ncharacteristics and fame of the Umbrian manner beyond the seclusion\r\nof its highland cradle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *135: Some magnificent works by Allegretto Nuzi of a most\r\nsurprising loveliness may be seen in Fabriano.]\r\n\r\nFRANCESCO DI GENTILE was born at Fabriano about 1370, and,\r\nafter maturely studying all that was best there and at Gubbio,\r\nhe set forth to enlarge his field of observation. Florence was\r\nperhaps his first point of attraction, for nowhere else could he see\r\nsuch beautiful art. But resisting those seductions which the vast\r\ncompositions of the Gaddi, Orcagna, and other Giottists held out to\r\nan ardent and youthful ambition, he preserved in their purity the\r\nholy inspirations of the fatherland, and meeting little sympathy for\r\nthese among the fraternity of St. Luke, he sought for himself a more\r\nsuitable companionship in the cloister of S. Domenico. There it was\r\nhis good fortune to discover a man whose rare character realised\r\nthose transcendental qualities, of which we read in the saintly\r\nlegends of pristine times, without regarding them as real ingredients\r\nin human character.\r\n\r\nFRA GIOVANNI DA FIESOLE had spent the years which other\r\nyouths wasted on stormy pleasures in acquiring the art of miniature\r\npainting, and its sacred representations took such hold of his\r\nfeelings, that, abjuring the world, he assumed the habit of St.\r\nDominic. But finding that his art, far from interfering with the\r\nholy sentiments which a tender conscience considered as inseparable\r\nfrom his new profession, tended directly to spiritualise them,\r\nthe neophyte continued to exercise it; and upon settling himself\r\nin the convent of S. Marco, he extended his style to fresco, ever\r\nadhering to those pure forms of celestial bliss which no one before\r\nor since has equalled. It is related of him that, regarding his\r\npainting in the light of a God-gift, he never sat down to exercise\r\nit without offering up orisons for divine influence, nor did he\r\nassume his palette until he felt these answered by a glow of holy\r\ninspiration. His pencil thus literally embodied the language of\r\nprayer; his compositions were the result of long contemplation on\r\nmystic revelations; his Madonnas borrowed their sweet and sinless\r\nexpression from ecstatic visions; the passion of our Saviour was\r\nconceived by him in tearful penitence, and executed with sobs\r\nand sighs. Deeming the forms he thus predicted to proceed from\r\nsupernatural dictation, he never would alter or retouch them; and\r\nthough his works are generally brought to the highest attainable\r\nfinish, the impress of their first conception remains unchanged. To\r\nthe unimaginative materialism of the present day, these sentences\r\nmay seem idle absurdities, but they illustrate the character of Fra\r\nGiovanni, and no painter ever so thoroughly instilled his character\r\ninto his works. Those who have not had the good fortune to see\r\nany of these cannot form an idea of the infantine simplicity, the\r\nimmaculate countenances, the unimpassioned pathos apparent in his\r\nfigures, nor of the transparent delicacy of his flesh-tints, and the\r\ngay and cheerful colouring which he introduces into the details,\r\nwithout injury to the angelic grace of the whole. These qualities\r\nprocured for their author the epithet of Angelico; his personal\r\nvirtues were acknowledged by an offer of the see of Fiesole, which\r\nhis humility declined and by the posthumous honour of beatification;\r\nhis paintings, to borrow the words of Vasari, elevated the utmost\r\nperfection to the ideal of art, by improving without abandoning\r\nits original type; and, in the characteristic language of Michael\r\nAngelo, he must have studied in heaven the faces which he depicted on\r\nearth.[136]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Such testimony, from artists so antipathic to his\r\npractice, is a curious tribute at once to his merit and influence.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the instructor with whom, although his junior, Gentile\r\nthought it no disparagement to place himself,[*137] and his works\r\ntestify to his having caught much of the spirit as well as the\r\nelaborate finish of his master. But whilst Angelico passed his\r\ntime in decorating the cells of his convent with frescoes, whose\r\nholy beauties have confirmed the faith and purified the secret\r\ncontemplations of many a recluse, his pupil returned to the world,\r\nto follow up a successful career. Called to Orvieto about 1423,\r\nhe there painted two altars, which, though not his best works, are\r\npeculiarly interesting in contrast with the grand productions which\r\nat a later period his master executed for that cathedral.[*138] In\r\nthe registers of the fabric, he is, in 1425, designated as \"master\r\nof the masters\"; and the fame which he thus acquired brought him\r\nsuccessive commissions at Florence and Siena, after which he was\r\nextensively employed in enriching the cities of Umbria and La Marca\r\nwith works of which no trace now exists.[*139] Among these towns\r\nwere Gubbio and Urbino; but still more interesting to our immediate\r\nsubject,--the development of art under the Feltrian dukes,--is\r\nthe altar-piece executed by him at Romita, near Fabriano, and now\r\nplundered and scattered by the French, part of which adorns the\r\nBrera Gallery at Milan. The Madonna is crowned by her Son, the Dove\r\nfluttering between them, the Father rising pyramidally behind, amid a\r\nchoir of cherubim; below, in the empyrean void, is an arch spanning\r\nthe sun and moon, on which stand eight angels, making melody of\r\npraise on various instruments. So extended was the reputation of this\r\nwork, that Raffaele is believed to have been attracted thither in\r\nhis youth, to imbibe that devotional sentiment which he was destined\r\nto advance to its culminating point of excellence. Another fountain\r\nof his early inspiration was the famous, but now defaced, Madonna of\r\nForano, near Osimo, whose angelic beauty is described as well-fitted\r\nto have left an indelible charm upon minds less pure and enthusiastic\r\nthan his. On the mere evidence of its ecstatic loveliness, it was\r\ngenerally ascribed to Beato Angelico; but as there is no account of\r\nthe Frate having visited La Marca, it may probably have been produced\r\nby Gentile, when his return to his native mountains had freed him\r\nfor a season from mundane impressions, and had restored him to the\r\nsanctifying influence of its legendary abstractions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *137: Gentile da Fabriano was the pupil of Allegretto Nuzi,\r\nnot of Fra Angelico.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *138: There is only one fragment of Gentile's work in the\r\nDuomo of Orvieto: a Madonna, painted in 1425.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *139: A fine work still remains at Perugia, No. 39, in Sala\r\nV., Pinacoteca.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA DEL SOCCORSO\r\n\r\n_After the gonfalone by a pupil of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo in S.\r\nFrancesco Montone_]\r\n\r\nFrom thence he proceeded to Venice, where many of his most brilliant\r\nperformances were achieved; but these, too, are nearly all lost to\r\nus. There, in contact with the busy world, and sharing its honours,\r\ndistracted, it may be, by the bright tints and smiling landscapes\r\njust then imported from northern lands, his devotional inspirations\r\nwere gradually tinged by naturalism. His principal commission was\r\na fresco of the naval victories of the Republic; and I have seen\r\na small picture by him of the rape of the Sabines, whose feeble\r\npaganism belongs, no doubt, to his later years, and sadly proves how\r\nessential were these inspirations to his success. At Venice he opened\r\na school, which enjoyed high reputation, and which probably numbered\r\namong its pupils Pisanello, the Vivarini, and Bellini, although\r\nchronology throws a doubt upon some of Vasari's assertions as to this\r\npoint. A new field of glory opened before Gentile, when invited by\r\nEugene IV. to decorate with mural paintings the since rebuilt church\r\nof the Lateran, where he painted four prophets in chiaroscuro, and\r\nplaced below them the life of the Baptist,--works unfinished at his\r\ndeath in 1450, and now destroyed, but which Michael Angelo, little\r\nqualified as he was to appreciate the delicacies of religious art,\r\ncharacterised as worthy the _gentle_ name of their author.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the cloister of S. Marco, Gentile had carried with him\r\na portion of the devotional feeling which hung around the studio of\r\nFra Giovanni, and along with it much of the taste for rich ornaments,\r\nfor gold and brocades, for fruit and flowers, in which both of his\r\ninstructors delighted. But whilst Allegretto and Angelico kept such\r\nforeign aids in subservience to the predominating sentiment of their\r\nworks, their pupil caught from the great world, in which he freely\r\nmingled with credit and applause, an admiration of mundane grandeur\r\nwhich, in his later compositions, is singularly combined with the\r\nspirit of religious art. His immaculate Madonnas are worshipped\r\nless by angelic choirs of cherubim and seraphim, than by the great\r\nones of the earth in their trappings of dignity; and of all sacred\r\nthemes, the Epiphany, or adoration of the Magi kings at the stable\r\nof Bethlehem, was his choice. Such is the magnificent altar-panel\r\nwhich he wrought in 1423, for the church of the S. Trinità at\r\nFlorence, now one of the most precious monuments in the Belle Arti\r\nthere. Still more gorgeous is his crowded composition painted for\r\nthe Zeni of Venice; but there he has contaminated the purist spirit\r\nof Christian painting, for in the suite of the eastern kings is\r\nportrayed the patron of the picture, with all the gallant company who\r\nattended his embassy from the Republic to Usamkassan, sovereign of\r\nPersia. The unequalled variety of groups, the elaborate splendour of\r\noriental costumes, the crowd of horsemen in contrasted attitudes, the\r\nlavish adoption of gold, form a dazzling but harmonious whole, which\r\nhas scarcely any parallel in painting. It is not improbable that\r\nthis and similar works, besides introducing a new element into the\r\nsemi-Byzantine practice of the Venetian school, may have spread to\r\nAlbert Durer and other Germans, who long after visited that\r\n\r\n     \"Ruler of the waters and their powers,\"\r\n\r\nan influence carried by them to Nuremberg and Cologne, to enrich\r\nthe already gaudy tendencies of ultramontane taste. But Gentile da\r\nFabriano possesses another claim upon the student of early painting,\r\nhitherto inadequately noticed. To the lessons of his father, a\r\nlearned mathematician, he may have owed the linear perspective which,\r\nin many of his productions, anticipated the improvements of Piero\r\ndella Francesca. This is observable in the Zeno picture, and still\r\nmore in a small predella in my possession, where his favourite theme,\r\nthe Epiphany, is completed by a background accurately laid out in\r\nlines and compartments, such as we see in the Dutch gardens of the\r\nseventeenth century. But to this question we must return.\r\n\r\nAmong the artists who maintained in Umbria the influences left\r\nby Ottaviano and Gentile, two were of special merit, NICOLÒ\r\nALUNNO, of Foligno, and BENEDETTO BONFIGLI, of Perugia. Their works\r\nhave been often confounded, but with the latter only have we to do,\r\nfor, besides being nearer to Gentile both in age and in manner, he\r\nis generally considered as the master of PIETRO PERUGINO,[*140] and\r\nthus forms a link in the artistic chain which we are endeavouring to\r\nestablish, through the best Umbrian painters, from ODERIGI OF GUBBIO\r\nto RAFFAELE OF URBINO. Of Bonfigli there are several interesting and\r\nwell-preserved specimens in his native town, dated about 1466, but\r\nit must be owned that none of the earliest known works of Perugino\r\nexhibit much trace of his style. These, however, are all supposed\r\nposterior to Pietro's first visit to Florence, where his ideas must\r\nhave undergone vast development from the examples of Masaccio and\r\nother masters, who there formed a galaxy of talent about the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century.[*141] In that city he formed his early\r\nfriendship with Leonardo da Vinci, which Sanzi says was cemented\r\nby parity of age as of affection; and it is singular how little\r\nsuch sympathy can be traced in their genius or works. When, on the\r\nother hand, we contrast the placid features which Vannucci uniformly\r\nlimned, rarely ruffled by sorrow, never clouded by sin, with the\r\nfurious mien and restless energy of Michael Angelo's creations, we\r\nmay well credit Vasari's story of their quarrel, and can account\r\nfor the scrimp justice accorded to the painter of Città della Pieve\r\nby his Florentine biographer. They pretend not, indeed, to the\r\nbold character of Signorelli, nor even to the severity of Mantegna,\r\nor Piero della Francesca; but those who criticise them as stiff,\r\ntimid, and monotonous, in contrast with the performances of the next\r\ngeneration, would arrive at more just conclusions did they include in\r\nthe comparison those painters who had preceded him, and whose example\r\nwas his early guide.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *140: We do not know who Perugino's Perugian master was;\r\nbut it was more likely to be Fiorenzo di Lorenzo than Bonfigli.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *141: There is no trace of Masaccio's influence in\r\nPerugino's work. He was influenced by Signorelli, and slightly by\r\nVerrocchio.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us turn to Urbino. Lanzi tells us that Giotto, Gentile da\r\nFabriano, and their respective followers, left works in that little\r\ncapital; where Pungileone has shown that Ottaviano Nelli exercised\r\nhis profession from 1428 to 1433, and Paolo Uccello of Florence in\r\n1468, with other artists detected by the same zealous antiquary. Of\r\nsuch works, however, nothing can now be traced. The oldest paintings\r\nI could discover there were those in the oratory of St. John Baptist\r\nby Lorenzo and Giacomo di San Severino, Lanzi's blunders regarding\r\nwhom have been corrected by the Marchese Ricci. The principal\r\ncomposition is the Crucifixion, with a dramatic action influenced by\r\nGiottesque feeling: the three other walls seem to have been occupied\r\nby a history of the titular saint, two passages of which are almost\r\ndestroyed. Those remaining, though not exempt from retouching, are\r\nsufficiently preserved to enable us to detect a masterly and novel\r\narrangement, and a character of devotion more consistent with the\r\nUmbrian manner, though marred by hard colouring. The date 1416 is\r\nadded to the painter's epigraph. We learn from an old chronicle that\r\nAntonio da Ferrara painted the Montefeltro chapel in the church of\r\nS. Francesco in 1430, a fact scarcely reconcileable with Vasari's\r\nassertion that he was a pupil of Angelo Gaddi. He is also said to\r\nhave executed an _ancona_ for the church of S. Bernardino, portions\r\nof which may probably be recognised in some figures still in the\r\nsacristy. In that of S. Francesco at Mercatello, among several\r\nmemorials of a similar period, are {1843} two frescoes characterised\r\nby grand design, ample draperies, and full colouring, but deficient\r\nin delicacy. The _lunette_ of the marriage of St. Catherine outside\r\nthe door is somewhat later, and very superior, and may be from the\r\npencil of Pietro della Francesca. Of none of these works, nor of\r\ntwo good panel pictures in the same church, have I been able to\r\nfind any account. In the hospital of S. Angelo in Vado is a panel\r\naltar picture in utter ruin, which has possessed surpassing beauty.\r\nThe martyrdom of St. Sebastian is there powerfully conceived, and\r\nexecuted with the finest feeling. The inscription seems to have been,\r\n_Hieronymus Nardia Vicentis fecit_; the date probably towards the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century. Such is the beggarly account we have\r\nto offer of early art in the country of Raffaele, and thus might we\r\ndismiss the speculations of those who would fondly trace its primary\r\ninfluences on his dawning genius.\r\n\r\nBut though time and whitewash have combined to narrow this branch of\r\nour inquiry, we must not overlook an artist who ranks high among the\r\nreformers of painting, and upon whom the patronage of Duke Federigo\r\nwas specially lavished. His family name has not come down to us, but\r\nhe is generally known by the matronymic of Piero della Francesca,\r\nfrom the Christian name of his mother, though sometimes designed\r\nPietro del Borgo, or Il Borghese, from Borgo S. Sepolcro, his native\r\ntown. His life has unfortunately been left in much obscurity by his\r\nonly biographer Vasari, who might have well bestowed somewhat more\r\npains upon the career of one born in a neighbouring town, who left\r\nhis finest works at Arezzo, and whose merits he is more inclined to\r\nmagnify than to slight. The loose assertions of this author have\r\nbeen adopted by most succeeding writers, without addition and with\r\nlittle investigation; but of the school in which Pietro acquired the\r\nrudiments of his art, and of the earlier period of his career, we\r\nremain still uninformed, though his age and Apennine origin favour\r\nthe conjecture that he may have imbibed his first lessons from works\r\nof Ottaviano Nelli the contemporary Umbrian master.[*142] Beyond\r\nquestion two very different manners appear in the productions of his\r\npencil; the first, crudely composed and laboriously frittered into\r\ndetail, with much of the contracted ideas and bright tinting of the\r\nold miniaturists; the second, broad and masterly in conception, and\r\nexecuted with a flowing pencil, though retaining an elaborate finish.\r\nBoth styles are united in a little picture at Urbino, which we shall\r\npresently describe, the Flagellation being in the earlier, the three\r\nportraits in the larger manner. If born, as Vasari incorrectly\r\nstates, in the last years of the fourteenth century,[*143] Piero,\r\ninstead of being patronised by Guidobaldo I., must have reached at\r\nleast eighty-four in that Duke's time; indeed, he would have been\r\npast middle life ere Federigo, whom, as we shall presently see, he\r\ncalls his chief patron, succeeded to that state in 1443. \"Guidobaldo\r\nFeltro\" may, however, probably be a mistake of Vasari for Count\r\nGuidantonio, in which case a solution would be afforded for several\r\nof his manifold contradictions; and at that court, if not in earlier\r\nlife, our artist might have been the associate or pupil of Nelli.\r\nPassing over works now lost which del Borgo is stated on the same\r\nauthority to have executed at Pesaro, Ferrara, Ancona, and Loreto,\r\nwe find him called by Nicholas V. to Rome, where his frescoes appear\r\nto have been destroyed in the many alterations made on the Vatican\r\nPalace before that century closed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *142: Piero della Francesca was the pupil of Domenico\r\nVeneziano.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *143: Piero was born in 1416.]\r\n\r\nPiero della Francesca is also asserted by Vasari to have been\r\none of the most profound mathematicians of his day, and to have\r\nimproved perspective and the management of light by an adaptation\r\nof geometrical principles to painting. The latter of these opinions\r\nhas been received, and constitutes the highest claim of this\r\nmaster upon the historians of art. The point has not as yet been\r\nillustrated by any writer competent to pronounce with accuracy\r\nupon such pretensions,[*144] but the merit of having shown how to\r\nameliorate perspective, especially in architectural design, is\r\ngenerally granted to Piero. Pascoli and others have regarded him as\r\nits father. Lanzi thinks him the first who revived the ancient Greek\r\nnotion of rendering geometry subject to painting in general, although\r\nBrunelleschi, Paolo Uccelli, and others had already applied the same\r\nprinciples with less science to architectural details; and he combats\r\nthe priority in these respects asserted by Lomazzo for Foppa of\r\nBrescia. The claims of Leon Battista Alberti,[*145] the architect,\r\nseem to have been settled by Vasari's opinion that distance was\r\nbetter described by his pen than delineated by his pencil. The same\r\nauthor enlists our sympathy in favour of Il Borghese, representing\r\nhim as defrauded of his fame by an unscrupulous scholar, Fra Luca\r\nPacioli, a Franciscan, who, after learning from him mathematics,\r\navailed himself of his instructor's after blindness to plagiarise his\r\nmanuscripts, and eventually published them as his own.[*146] Into\r\nthis controverted matter we need not enter, further than to pronounce\r\nwith Tiraboschi, Rosini, and Gaye a verdict of _not proven_, and to\r\nobserve that the celebrity attained by the friar's scientific works\r\nought to reflect some merit upon his instructor. Yet justice to both\r\nparties requires us to extract the generous testimony volunteered to\r\nthe painter by his pupil, in dedicating to Duke Guidobaldo his Summa\r\nde Arithmetica, Geometria, &c.: \"Perspective, if closely looked into,\r\nwould certainly be nothing without the aid of geometry, as has been\r\nfully demonstrated by Pietro di Franceschi, our contemporary, and\r\nthe prince of modern painting. During his assiduous service in your\r\nExcellency's family, he composed his short treatise on the art of\r\npainting and the power of linear perspective, which is now deservedly\r\nplaced in your library, rich with books in every branch.\" These,\r\nsurely, are not the words of a literary pirate; indeed, Vasari's\r\nwhole account is vague and confused. After telling us that Pacioli\r\nhad appropriated the matter of Piero's many MSS., then existing at\r\nBorgo San Sepolcro, he adds that most of his writings were deposited\r\nin the Urbino library, where it is obvious that neither he nor\r\nthose who have repeated his assertions ever sought them. After\r\nevery possible search, I have reason to believe that that library\r\nnow contains but two treatises by Il Borghese, nor have I found any\r\nevidence of others having ever been there. Both are in Latin, and are\r\nfairly transcribed on vellum in contemporary hands, with diagrams\r\nupon the margin.[147] The former is entitled _De Perspectiva_, but\r\nthe subject is, in fact, Light,[*148] and its effect upon objects\r\nand colours. In place of a general title, it sets out with a dictum\r\nthat \"light is to philosophical inquiry what demonstrative certainty\r\nis to mathematics.\" The volume, bearing the arms and initials of\r\nDuke Federigo, must have been written for his library: though\r\nanonymous, it is clearly the work referred to in a dedication which\r\nwe shall presently quote, the only other MS. upon perspective in the\r\ncollection being that by Vitellioni (No. 265).\r\n\r\n[Footnote *144: Cf. PICHI, _La Vita e le Opere di Piero\r\ndella Francesca_ (Borgo S. Sepolcro, 1893); WITTING, _Piero\r\ndei Franceschi_ (Strassburg, 1898); CROWE & CAVALCASELLE,\r\n_op. cit._, vol. III. BERENSON, _op. cit._, p. 69, says:\r\n\"The pupil of Domenico Veneziano in characterisation, of Paolo\r\nUccello in perspective, himself an eager student of this science, as\r\nan artist he [Piero] was more gifted than either of his teachers.\"\r\nFra Luca Pacioli, one of the finest mathematicians of his day,\r\npraises Piero, and speaks of his renowned treatise on perspective,\r\n\"now in the library of our illustrious Duke of Urbino.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *145: Cf. on this point MUNTZ, _Precursori e\r\npropugnatori del Rinascimento_ (Firenze, 1902), p. 59 _et seq._ For\r\nhis life _Vita Leonis Baptistae de Albertis_, by an anonymous author,\r\nbelieved to be Alberti himself, in MURATORI _R.I.S._, vol.\r\nXXV., partly translated in EDWARD HUTTON, _Sigismondo Malatesta_\r\n(Dent, 1906), pp. 163-9.

Piero\r\nwas never blind at all it seems. BOSSI, in his work on Leonardo's\r\n_Cenacolo_ (Milan, 1810), deals minutely with this libel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1374 and 632.

As a further specimen of the Friar's ideas on\r\nthis matter, we may offer an extract from his _De Divina Proportione\r\nEpistola_ (Venice, 1509), wherein he compares perspective to music,\r\nranking both with the geometrical sciences, since just as \"the former\r\nrefreshes the mind with harmony, the latter delights it greatly by\r\ncorrect distance and variety of colours.\" \"Who, indeed, is there\r\nthat, seeing an elegant figure with its exact outlines well defined,\r\nand seeming to want nothing but breath, would not pronounce it\r\nsomething rather divine than human? And painting imitates nature as\r\nnearly as can be told, which is proved to our eyes in the exquisite\r\nrepresentation, so worthily composed by the graceful hand of our\r\nLeonardo, of the ardent desire after our salvation; wherein it is\r\nimpossible to imagine greater attention than that of the apostles,\r\naroused on hearing, in the words of infallible truth, 'One of you\r\nshall betray me,'--when, interchanging with each other attitudes and\r\ngestures, they seem to converse in startled and sad astonishment.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *148: \"He was perhaps the first,\" says Mr. Berenson, \"to\r\nuse effects of light for their direct tonic or subduing or soothing\r\nqualities.\" He uses light as the \"plein air\" school of France uses\r\nit. See a chapter devoted to his work in my _Cities of Umbria_\r\n(Methuen, 1904).]\r\n\r\nThe other volume has for title _Petri Pictoris Burgensis de Quinque\r\nCorporibus Regularibus_. The five bodies discussed in it are, the\r\ntriangle of four bases, the cube with six faces, the octagon with\r\neight faces and as many triangles, the duodecahedron with twelve\r\nfaces and as many pentagons, the icosahedron with twenty faces and as\r\nmany triangles. We shall extract from the dedication to Guidobaldo I.\r\na passage relating to the essay and its author: \"And as my works owe\r\nwhatever illustration they possess solely to the brilliant star of\r\nyour excellent father, the most bright and dazzling orb of our age,\r\nit seemed not unbecoming that I should dedicate to your Majesty this\r\nlittle work, on the five regular bodies in mathematics, which I have\r\ncomposed, that, in this extreme fraction of my age, my mind might not\r\nbecome torpidly inactive. Thus may your splendour reflect a light\r\nupon its obscurity: and your Highness will not spurn these feeble and\r\nworthless fruits, gathered from a field now left fallow, and nearly\r\nexhausted by age, from which your distinguished father has drawn\r\nits better produce; but will place this in some corner, as a humble\r\nhandmaid to the numberless books of your own and his copious library,\r\nnear our other treatise on Perspective, which we wrote in former\r\nyears. For it is usual to admit, at the most luxurious and festive\r\nbanquets, fruits culled by a rude and unpolished peasant. Indeed, its\r\nnovelty may ensure its proving not unpleasing; for though the subject\r\nwas known from Euclid and other geometers, it is now [first] applied\r\nby me to arithmetical science. At all events, it will be a token and\r\nmemorial of my long-cherished attachment and continual devotion to\r\nyourself and your illustrious house.\"\r\n\r\nThis must have been written after 1482, when, if Vasari's dates be\r\naccurate, Piero was at least eighty-four years old, and had been\r\nblind during five lustres; a circumstance which, though not entirely\r\ninconsistent with his cultivation of the exact sciences, would\r\noccasion an impediment not likely to be passed over by him, when\r\npleading as an apology the disabilities of age. The researches of\r\nAbbé Pungeleoni have, however, established that no such calamity\r\nhad befallen our painter in 1469, when he was the guest of Giovanni\r\nSanzi, at Urbino; and it is no way referred to in Pacioli's\r\ndedication, written in 1494, while he was still alive. Altogether,\r\nit may be questioned whether that alleged bereavement was not one\r\nof Vasari's many inaccuracies, the most valuable portion of whose\r\naccount of this master is a notice of the frescoes executed by\r\nhim in the choir of S. Francesco, at Arezzo, wherein are depicted\r\nthe Discovery and Exaltation of the true Cross, and the Vision\r\nand Victory of Constantine. These noble works, uniting a happy\r\napplication of his favourite studies on perspective and light, with\r\na grandeur and movement unknown to most of his compositions, are\r\nnow mere wrecks,[*149] in which, however, may be traced not a few\r\nideas subsequently appropriated by more celebrated artists. The\r\nmost remarkable of them is the Vision, the original drawing for\r\nwhich has been published by Mr. Young Ottley. In the play of light\r\nand the management of chiaroscuro, there is far more profound study\r\nthan was usual among his contemporaries, and in no other work of so\r\nearly a date have these been as successfully treated. By a not very\r\nintelligible juxtaposition, the companion compartment is occupied\r\nby an Annunciation, grave, solemn, almost severe, as are most of\r\nhis later paintings. The lowest and largest space on either side\r\nof the choir, is filled by the Battle, whilst Constantine prays in\r\na corner, surrounded by his courtiers. These may have suggested to\r\nRaffaele the same subject for the Stanze, but they afford no details\r\ncalculated to animate his pencil. Soldiers, horses, and banners are,\r\nindeed, mingled together with a bustle and energy of action hitherto\r\nunattempted; but the effect is neutralised by an all-prevailing\r\nconfusion, and by a want of groups or episodes to concentrate\r\nthe spectator's scattered interest or admiration. The design is\r\ngenerally good; the modelling and character of the heads are, as\r\nusual, excellent; the costumes are richly varied; and the horses\r\nremind us, by their action, of Pisano's pictures and medals. If it be\r\ntrue that Raffaele has repeated some of the noble ideas here freely\r\nlavished, it seems more probable that, in his Liberation of St.\r\nPeter, he wished to excel the tent scene, than that he bore in mind\r\nthe crowded men-at-arms when composing the Victory of Constantine.\r\nThe elements have conspired against this _chef-d'oeuvre_ of Pietro\r\ndel Borgo. Its walls were frightfully riven during last century by\r\nan earthquake, and its menacing cracks have since been shaken by\r\nthunderbolts. Although the repairs have been judiciously limited\r\nto securing the plaster, without attempting any restoration of the\r\nfrescoes, several compartments are almost wholly defaced. Some female\r\ngroups, however, remain, which yield to nothing that Masaccio has\r\nleft for the plaudits of posterity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *149: They are in quite fair preservation as things go.]\r\n\r\nIn much better preservation is a hitherto unnoticed painting on\r\nthe wall of a chapel in the cathedral of Rimini, dated 1448. It\r\nrepresents Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, whom we have so often\r\nnamed in the first volume of this work, kneeling in prayer before\r\nhis patron saint, Sigismondo, king of Hungary. The wide and once\r\nbeautifully graduated landscape has unfortunately suffered; but the\r\nfavourite dog,[*150] crouching behind, is evidently as striking\r\na likeness as his master, whose dignified character and serious\r\npose give to what is but a laboriously accurate portrait, the\r\nspiritualised grandeur of a noble devotional composition. It embodies\r\nthe verity of nature, exempt from the vulgarity of naturalism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *150: There are two greyhounds lying side by side facing\r\nopposite ways.]\r\n\r\nWe have to lament the disappearance of whatever works in fresco\r\nPietro del Borgo may have executed for Urbino, unless we attribute\r\nto him, on an already noticed lunette over the outer doorway of S.\r\nFrancesco, at Mercatello, a beautiful half-length Marriage of St.\r\nCatherine. Of the small pictures, which he is said by Vasari to have\r\npainted for that court, one only remains; it is in the sacristy\r\nof the Urbino cathedral, and is a monument of great interest as\r\nregards the master and his patrons. On one side is the Flagellation\r\nof Christ before Pilate, in an open court enriched with a beautiful\r\nperspective of colonnades and architectural ornament. On the other\r\nis introduced a detached group of three figures in conversation,\r\nmagnificently attired, who are generally called at Urbino the\r\nsuccessive sovereigns Oddantonio, Federigo, and Guidobaldo I.; but\r\ntheir ages, compared with that of the painter, are irreconcileable\r\nwith such a supposition. The Abbé Pungeleoni, in his _Life of\r\nSanzi_, considers them to represent Count Guidantonio and his\r\nsuccessors, Oddantonio and Federigo; or they may more probably be\r\nportraits of Oddantonio and the two evil counsellors who led him and\r\nthemselves to destruction, as narrated in our third chapter.[151]\r\nIn the graphic character and fine modelling of their features is\r\ndisplayed one of those peculiar excellences which Il Borghese was\r\nable, from his knowledge of perspective and light, to introduce into\r\nthe practice of pictorial art, and which he is said to have carried\r\nout by making finished figures of clay, and draping them with various\r\nmaterials. This precious little picture is signed _Opus Petri de\r\nBorgo Sci. Sepulcri_, and we have already quoted it as illustrative\r\nof both his first and second manner. I have been so fortunate as to\r\ntrace three more of the Urbino pictures of this master, hitherto\r\nunnoticed. At the devolution of the duchy to the Holy See, they\r\nfound their way into the possession of Urban VIII., and now adorn\r\nthe private apartment of his successor, Prince Barberini, at Rome,\r\nwhere they pass under the name of Mantegna. The first, a portrait\r\nof Duke Federigo and his son, has been already described. Having\r\nbeen executed about 1478, when Guidobaldo was five or six years\r\nold, and when the painter, according to Vasari, was above eighty,\r\nit would afford conclusive evidence against the hitherto received\r\ndate of Pietro's birth.[152] The other two are companion pictures,\r\nand though hung too high, appear in excellent preservation. Both\r\nare architectural designs on panel, one representing the court of a\r\npalace, the other a basilicon-like interior, with elaborate plastic\r\ndecorations and very clever perspective; a variety of figures are\r\nintroduced, but the subjects are not known.[*153] To these, and\r\nstill more to some of his earlier productions, may be applied the\r\nobservation of Fra Castiglione, that \"the works of Pietro, and those\r\nof his contemporary, Melozzo da Forlì, with their perspective effects\r\nand intricacies of art, are appreciated by connoisseurs rather than\r\nadmired by the uninitiated.\"[*154]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: Passavant conjectures this group to be a satire upon\r\nthree neighbouring princes who were Duke Federigo's enemies, and\r\nseems to consider the picture influenced by some Flemish master. If\r\npainted after the visit of Justis of Ghent, it can hardly represent\r\nOddantonio. See below, ch. xxx.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: It is very unsatisfactorily engraved in\r\nBONNARD'S _Costumes du Treizième au Quinzième Siècle_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *153: None of these three belongs to Piero.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *154: It is a curious comment on this that a man like Mr.\r\nE.V. Lucas, certainly not \"a connoisseur,\" tells us in his book,\r\n_A Wanderer in London_ (Methuen, 1906), that he \"once startled and\r\nembarrassed a dinner table of artists and art critics by asking\r\nwhich was the best picture in the National Gallery. On my modifying\r\nthis terrible question to the more human form--Which picture would\r\nyou choose if you might have one? and limiting the choice to the\r\nItalian masters, the most distinguished mind present named at\r\nonce Tintoretto's _Origin of the Milky Way_.... After very long\r\nconsideration,\" he continues, \"I have come to the conclusion that\r\nmine would be Francesca's _Nativity_. Take it for all in all, I am\r\ndisposed to think that Francesca's _Nativity_ appeals to me as a work\r\nof compassionate beauty and charm before any Italian picture in the\r\nNational Collection.\"]\r\n\r\nThe important influence of Pietro del Borgo upon Umbrian art is\r\nconfirmed by Vasari, in naming among his scholars Perugino and\r\nSignorelli, the latter of whom worked at Urbino in 1484, and again,\r\nten years later. But were our information as to his pupils more\r\nample, we might probably find among them Melozzo da Forlì, to whom,\r\nand to other names connected with the duchy we shall return in our\r\nthirty-first chapter. Prominently among its painters, Lanzi has\r\nenumerated Bartolomeo Corradi, who became a predicant friar by the\r\ntitle of FRA CARNEVALE. Nothing is known of this talented\r\nlimner beyond the fact that he combined his art with the duties of\r\nparish priest, at Castel Cavellino, and died soon after 1488. His\r\nbest known work was executed for the great altar of S. Bernardino,\r\nnear Urbino, as an _ex voto_ commemoration of Federigo's piety on\r\nthe birth of his son in 1472. In it the Duke's portrait, and those\r\nof several of his children, are said to be introduced. Indeed, there\r\nare not wanting old authorities who regard the Madonna and Child as\r\nlikenesses of Countess Battista and her infant Guidobaldo. I receive\r\nwith caution a conjecture which, repugnant to the ideas of Umbrian\r\nart at that period, would fasten a charge of profane naturalism upon\r\none whom I should gladly consider as a purely Christian painter.\r\nPungeleoni ascribes to him a small devotional picture preserved in\r\nthe church of the Zoccolantines at Sinigaglia, in which two accessory\r\nfigures probably represent the Prefect Giovanni della Rovere and his\r\nwife, the sister of Duke Guidobaldo I.; but their marriage only took\r\nplace about the supposed time of this painter's death; and, at all\r\nevents, had the Abbé ever seen it, he could not have mistaken it for\r\na sketch of the altar-piece of S. Bernardino. The latter remains in\r\nthe Brera, at Milan, among the unrestored French plunder; and I have\r\nsought in vain for other identified works of Carnevale in the duchy,\r\nalthough inclined to attribute to him more than one fine but nameless\r\naltar-picture which I have found there.[155]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: Such is the magnificent Annunciation in a small chapel\r\nthree miles west from Pesaro, known as the Madonna del Monte, but\r\nproperly the oratory dedicated in 1505 to the Madonna dell'Annunziata\r\ndi Calibano, by Ludovico del Molino, _alias_ degli Agostini. Its pure\r\nand beautiful countenances are less beatified in expression than\r\nearlier Umbrian works, but in composition and draperies it yields to\r\nnone, and excels all others in gorgeous effect. The gilding is freely\r\nlaid on in broad masses, and a scintillation in solid gold streams\r\nfrom the Almighty upon the Madonna's bosom, while the angels' wings\r\nare starred with peacock's plumage. Yet, as in Gentile da Fabriano's\r\nbest works, all this glitter is subdued by an earnest and solemn\r\nfeeling becoming the theme. The panel is inscribed \"_Ludovicho di\r\nJachomo Aghostini merchatanti da Pesaro a fato [fare] deta tavola a\r\ndi xxiv. di Decienbre, mdx._\" How unfortunate that the pious donor\r\nhad not recorded the artist's name as well as his own! I was unable\r\nto visit an altar-piece at Montebaroccio ascribed to Fra Carnevale's\r\npencil.]\r\n\r\nOur description of Duke Federigo's palaces has made us acquainted\r\nwith the name of FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO, a painter and sculptor, as well\r\nas an architect and engineer. In the two former of these capacities\r\nhe can be appreciated only in his native Siena, where two of his\r\nvery rare pictures remain in the Belle Arti.[*156] His tendency\r\nto Umbrian feeling is obvious, and had Padre della Valle been\r\nacquainted with the productions of Fabriano and della Francesca,\r\nhe would have detected in him a nearer approach to their manner\r\nthan to that of Signorelli. But his fame depends on his numerous\r\ncreations in architecture and fortification; whilst his inventions\r\nin military engineering were important additions to the art of war,\r\nas then conducted. Vasari's brief and blundering notice of him was\r\nsupplemented by the researches of Padre della Valle, whose greedy\r\npatriotism maintained for him the merit of the Urbino palace, a\r\nclaim of which we have formerly disposed.[157] Gaye, and the editor\r\nof the Florentine edition of Vasari {1838}, have added many new and\r\ninteresting notices;[*158] but his name has of late received still\r\nmore ample illustration at the hands of Carlo Promis, of Turin, by\r\nwhom his life and principal writings have been edited, at the expense\r\nof the Chevalier Saluzzi. Francesco, son of Giorgio, son of Martino\r\nof Siena, was born in a humble rank about 1423; and, our earliest\r\nnotice of his professional labours is in 1447, when we find he was\r\none of the architects of the Orvieto cathedral. In 1447, we find him\r\nin Duke Federigo's service, which Promis supposes him to have entered\r\nshortly before; and there he appears to have remained until the death\r\nof that prince in 1482. The palace of Urbino having been already\r\nmany years in progress, and not being mentioned by him, there is no\r\nreason to suppose he was much occupied upon it; and we find his own\r\npen attesting the onerous duty imposed upon him by Federigo, as his\r\nmilitary engineer. In July 1478 he was attached to the allied army,\r\nwhich the Duke commanded; and, in his autograph MS. speaks of having\r\na hundred and thirty-six \"edifices\" on hand at once by his order.\r\nAmong these, doubtless, there were many strongholds in the duchy; and\r\nhe has left descriptive plans of Cagli, Sasso Feretro, Tavoletta, and\r\nSerra di S. Abondio. From various authorities cited by Promis, we may\r\nadd, as probably of his construction, Castel Durante, S. Angelo in\r\nVado, Orciano, S. Costanzo, S. Agata, Pietragutola, Montecirignone,\r\nS. Ippolito, Montalto, La Pergola, Cantiano, Fossombrone,\r\nSassocorbaro, Mercatello, Costaccioro, Mondavio, and Mondolfo,\r\nbesides numerous churches which he certainly planned for Federigo.\r\nThe fortresses of Urbino have been estimated at nearly three hundred,\r\na number which must seem at once superfluous and incredible, but\r\nfor the entire change which the arts of war and defence were then\r\nundergoing, consequent on a general introduction of artillery.[*159]\r\nFederigo, perceiving the importance of strengthening his castles and\r\ncitadels against\r\n\r\n     \"The cannon-ball, opening with murderous crash\r\n     The way to blast and ruin,\"\r\n\r\nnot only kept in active employment the most able engineer whom Italy\r\nthen possessed, but, according to that artist's testimony, by his own\r\nexperience and judicious suggestions, greatly facilitated the tasks\r\nwhich he imposed upon Francesco di Giorgio.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *156: There is a predella picture by him at S. Domenico,\r\nin Siena, and another in the Uffizi Gallery. He was the pupil of\r\nVecchietta.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: See vol. I., pp. 147-50, 161-3; _Lettere Sanesi_,\r\nIII., p. 79; _Carteggio d'Artisti_, _passim_, I., pp. 255-316.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *158: Cf. also BORGHESE & BANCHI, _Nuovi Documenti\r\nper la Storia dell'Arte Senese_ (Siena, 1898).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *159: On the fortresses of the Marche generally, see\r\nGASPARI, _Fortezze Marchigiane e Umbre_, in _Arch. St. per\r\nle Marche e per l'Umbria_, vol. III., p. 80 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nNor was it his professional services alone which the Sienese artist\r\nplaced at his patron's disposal. The documents published by Gaye and\r\nPromis show him accredited on various occasions as the Duke's envoy\r\nto the government of his native city; and his _Liber de Architectura_\r\nis dedicated to Federigo, at whose request, probably, it was\r\ncomposed. Vasari adds that he portrayed him both in painting and on\r\na medal; and, in return perhaps for these diversified labours, that\r\nprince thus interceded for his admission into the magistracy of Siena.\r\n\r\n     \"Mighty and potent Lords and beloved Brethren;\r\n\r\n     \"I have here in my service Francesco di Giorgio, your\r\n     fellow-citizen and my most favourite architect, who desires\r\n     to be placed in your magnificent magistracy, as the\r\n     ambition of his genius, excellence, prudence, and worth. I\r\n     therefore pray your Highnesses that you will be pleased to\r\n     elect him thereto, and to admit him into the number of your\r\n     public men, which I shall regard as a special boon, as will\r\n     be more fully stated to you on my behalf by your mighty\r\n     ambassador. And your Lordships may be assured that were I\r\n     not convinced that only good, faithful, and useful service\r\n     is to be looked for from him, I should not propose him, nor\r\n     intercede in his favour. And nothing more gratifying could\r\n     I ever receive from your Lordships, to whom I offer and\r\n     commend myself.\r\n\r\n     \"From Durante, the 26th July, 1480.\r\n\r\n     \"FEDERICUS DUX URBINI AC DURANTIS COMES, et Regius\r\n     Capit.

App. No. 36, and in Gualandi, Memorie\r\nArtistiche.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this request was unsuccessful, so well was Francesco\r\nappreciated at home, that on several occasions Duke Guidobaldo vainly\r\napplied to the magistracy for his services. Yet he was frequently\r\nemployed in the duchy from 1484 to 1489, the palace at Gubbio\r\naffording him partial employment. His military reputation being now\r\nwidely spread, he had commissions from various princes, especially\r\nthe sovereigns of Milan and Naples; but through these labours we need\r\nnot follow him. The time of his death is not known; he, however,\r\noutlived most of the fortresses he had raised for Federigo, which\r\nwere dismantled by order of his son, on abandoning his state in\r\n1502, a policy suggested by confident reliance on his subjects'\r\nattachment, as the best guarantee of his eventual restoration.\r\nFrancesco's MSS., dispersed in various libraries, are described in\r\nPromis's first volume. One of them, on architecture, transcribed for\r\nGuidobaldo II., was presented by him to Emanuel Filibert, Duke of\r\nSavoy, in 1568, and now ornaments the Royal Library at Turin. The\r\ninvention of that variety of bastion called in Italy _baluardo_, and\r\nin Germany _bollwerk_, has been claimed for several engineers, among\r\nwhom are three names belonging to Urbino,--Duke Francesco Maria I.,\r\nCentogatti the painter, and Commandino the mathematician. Promis, in\r\nthe second volume of his work already quoted, disposes of all these\r\npretensions in favour of Francesco di Giorgio. His learned discussion\r\nmay be allowed to decide this point, to which little interest\r\nnow attaches, as well as the question of explosive mines for the\r\ndestruction of military defences. Such an application of gunpowder\r\nhad already been partially resorted to, but the Sienese engineer\r\nfirst established its importance and methodised its application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n     Giovanni Sanzi of Urbino--His son the immortal\r\n     Raffaele--Early influences on his mind--Paints at Perugia,\r\n     Città di Castello, Siena, and Florence--His visits to\r\n     Urbino, and works there.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith GIOVANNI SANZI[*161] we have already made acquaintance\r\nas an epic poet. The patient labour of the Abbé Pungeleoni, and\r\nthe critical acumen of Passavant, have amply refuted Malvasia's\r\nspiteful, and Lanzi's careless but often quoted assertions, that\r\nthe father of Raffaele was an obscure potter, or, at best, an\r\nindifferent artist, from whom his son could learn little.[162] Those\r\nonly who have traced out his pictures in the remote townships and\r\nvillages of his native duchy, and who estimate his works by coeval\r\nproductions, can appreciate his real merits. Giovanni Sanzi was of\r\na humble family in the village of Colbordolo, a few miles east of\r\nUrbino, for whose fictitious ancestry of artists there has been\r\nsubstituted by his painstaking but most puzzle-headed eulogist, a\r\npedigree of peasantry from the middle of the fourteenth century. The\r\nson of one Sante, he assumed the patronymic Santi or Sanzi, which\r\nwas subsequently euphonised by Bembo for his son into Sanzio. His\r\ngrandfather Peruzuolo, after his losses by the Malatesta forays\r\nalready alluded to,[163] had sold the petty holdings he possessed at\r\nColbordolo, and removed his family to Urbino, where Sante became a\r\nretail dealer in various wares, and where he seems to have died in\r\neasy circumstances in 1485, nine years before his son. The inquiries\r\nof Pungeleoni have failed to ascertain the time of Giovanni's birth,\r\nbut it was probably to these losses that the poet thus touchingly\r\nalludes, in his dedication,[164] as the impulse under which he\r\nbecame a painter:--\"It would be tedious to relate the many straits\r\nand headlong precipices through which I have steered my life since\r\nfate devoured in flames my paternal nest, wherein was consumed all\r\nour substance; but arriving at the age when perhaps inclination\r\nwould have led me to some more useful exercise of talent, of the\r\nmany lines by which I might have gained a living, I devoted myself\r\nto the marvellous art of painting, which indeed (in addition to the\r\nround of domestic cares, of all human concerns the most ceaseless\r\ntorment) imposes a burden heavy even to the shoulders of Atlas,\r\nand in which distinguished profession I blush not to be enrolled.\"\r\nNeither are we enabled to throw any light upon the lessons to which\r\nGiovanni resorted for instruction in the calling which he thus, at\r\nsome sacrifice of material interests, had adopted. The catalogue of\r\ncontemporary artificers introduced into his Chronicle, including\r\nall that was eminent from Gentile da Fabriano to Leonardo da Vinci,\r\nshows a most extensive acquaintance with their respective styles, as\r\nwell as their names.[165] Mantegna is one of them whom he specially\r\nextols; there is, however, no similarity between their productions.\r\nYet, though we know nothing of Sanzi's artistic education, the\r\nworks which Nelli, Gentile da Fabriano, and Piero della Francesca\r\nleft in Urbino must have influenced his early impressions; and it\r\nis singular that nothing is said by them of these, and others who\r\npainted in the duchy, beyond the passing notice bestowed with little\r\ndiscrimination on all his contemporaries. The marked exclusion\r\nfrom this list of Justus of Ghent is plausibly conjectured by\r\nPassavant to indicate a professional jealousy of one who treasured\r\nas his secret the so-called oil painting brought by him from\r\nFlanders, and certainly never attained by Giovanni. Sanzi's manner\r\npartakes generally of the Umbrian character,--grave, reflective,\r\nself-possessed, without aiming at dramatic effect or artificial\r\nembellishment, yet not deficient in variety, or graceful expression.\r\nMore severe than Perugino, he approaches the serious figures of\r\nMelozzo da Forlì, but subdues their naturalism by an infusion of\r\ndevotional sincerity and simple feeling. He is partial to slender\r\nforms and delicately drawn feet and hands, but the contours are dark\r\nand hard, the flesh-tints dull and heavy, tending to cold gray in the\r\nshadows, and generally deficient in middle tints and reflections.\r\nHis female faces are oval, often of a dusky complexion, and their\r\nforeheads singularly full. In the nude, he was in advance of his\r\nage, and in landscape he attained great proficiency. Pungileone\r\nenumerates about twenty of his pictures, many of them still in their\r\noriginal sites, and exhibiting considerable inequality of merit.\r\nBut his _capo-d'opera_, and one of the most important monuments of\r\nUmbrian art, is the fresco in the Tiranni chapel, at S. Domenico\r\nof Cagli. In the recess over the altar is the Madonna, enthroned\r\nbetween two angels, in one of whom is understood to be portrayed\r\nthe young Raffaele, then a child of eight or nine years old. At the\r\nsides stand Saints Peter, Francis of Assisi, Thomas Aquinas, and\r\nJohn Baptist. On the lunette above, Christ has just emerged from his\r\ntomb in the mountain rock: a glorious Deity, the conqueror of death,\r\nhe bears in his left hand the banner of salvation, while his right\r\nis raised to bless a redeemed world, and scattered around lie six\r\nguards asleep, foreshortened in various and difficult attitudes. The\r\nvaulted roof displays a choir of angelic children, sounding their\r\ninstruments and chanting songs of glory to the Saviour, who occupies\r\nits centre, holding the book of life: and on the external angles\r\nare small medallions of the Annunciation. There is, perhaps, no\r\ncontemporary painting superior to this in grandeur of composition and\r\nstately pose of the figures; nor is it less admirable for novelty of\r\ncomposition and variety and ease of movement. The design is at once\r\ncorrect and flowing, and the expression, though fervid, oversteps not\r\ntruth and nature. Passavant well observes that the breadth, vigour,\r\nand dexterous treatment of this painting proved its author to have\r\nbeen well practised in fresco, although but one other such work of\r\nhis has escaped destruction or whitewash. In his house at Urbino,\r\nthere is a small mural painting, removed many years since from the\r\nground-floor to the first story, which tradition fondly claims as a\r\nboyish production of Raffaele, but which Passavant ascribes to Sanzi,\r\nconjecturing it to represent his wife and child. It is impossible to\r\npronounce a satisfactory judgment as to the master, from the load of\r\nover-painting in oil. Though called a Madonna and Child, it seems\r\nrather a gentle mother, who, having hushed her babe to sleep upon\r\nher knee, reads from the breviary on a stand by her seat, and the\r\ncomposition and attitudes present a charming naïveté and natural\r\nexpression. Connoisseurs agree in rejecting its claims as a work of\r\nRaffaele; nor does it quite resemble his father's usual type, though\r\nit is difficult to substitute any more plausible theory for the\r\nconclusion of Passavant. The reader may form his own judgment from\r\nthe accompanying outline, bearing in mind that much of the drapery\r\nbelongs to the pencil of a merciless restorer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *161: See works quoted p. 138, note *1 _supra_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: _Elogio Storico di Giovanni Santi_; Rafael von Urbino.\r\nThe few facts of importance which the Abbé's microscopic researches\r\nhave ascertained are scarcely extricable from the confusion that\r\nprevails in his eulogy and its accompanying, or rather darkening,\r\nnotes. The catalogue of Sanzi's works is useful to travellers, though\r\nsadly deficient in judicious criticism.

Vasari's narrative, though\r\ncompiled with more than his usual pains, and lavish in laudatory\r\nepithets, is far from satisfactory. Its author was the partial\r\nhistorian of a rival school, the favourite pupil of its jealous head.\r\nAs a Florentine, moreover, he was bound by Italian usage to keep in\r\nshadow the merits of all \"foreign\" competitors and teachers. Raffaele\r\nhe never saw, whose best pupils had left Rome ere Vasari visited the\r\neternal city: with his Apennine home, its records and memorials, the\r\nlatter had probably no personal acquaintance. While, therefore, we\r\nown our obligations to the writer of Arezzo for many important facts\r\nand valuable criticisms, we feel surprised that during above two\r\ncenturies no attempt was made to supplement his obvious deficiencies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *166: The works on Raphael would fill a library.

XIII., p. 248.]\r\n\r\n\"We may doubt whether in the whole range of modern history, or\r\nwithin the compass of modern Europe, one moment or one spot could\r\nbe found more singularly propitious than those which glory in\r\nRaffaele's birth. He was happy in his parentage and in his patrons,\r\nin his master and in his pupils, in his friends and in his rivals:\r\nthe first misfortune of his life was its rapid and untimely close.\r\nHe was late enough to profit by the example, early enough to feel\r\nthe living influence of four of the greatest masters of his art, of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, Giorgione, and Fra Bartolomeo. The\r\nart of painting in oil had been introduced into Italy barely half a\r\ncentury before his birth; its technical difficulties were already\r\nmastered, but it still awaited a master's hand to develop its latent\r\ncapabilities. His short life included the Augustan age of papal Rome,\r\nthe age of its splendour and magnificence, if not of its power, and\r\nhe died almost before the far-off sound of the rising storm had\r\nbroken the religious calm, or foretold the coming miseries of Italy.\r\nThe two pontiffs whom he served out-shone the most illustrious of\r\ntheir predecessors in their luxurious tastes and lavish patronage\r\nof the fine arts; and these arts still served the Church, not only\r\nwith the grateful zeal of favoured children, but with the earnest\r\ndevotion of undoubting faith.... In the age of Raffaele, while the\r\nrich and often graceful legends of the Catholic mythology still\r\nretained their ancient hold on the popular belief, the growing taste\r\namong the learned of the day for the literature and philosophy of\r\nancient Greece had done much, by softening their early rudeness ere\r\nit chilled their early feeling, to mould them to the higher purposes\r\nof art. Christian art too, relinquishing at last her long attachment\r\nto traditional types and conventional treatment, was willing to\r\nexchange a fruitless opposition to the graces and beauties of ancient\r\nart, for a bold attempt to enlist them in her service.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, when we examine the character and the times of those men\r\nwho have left the stamp of their genius most deeply on the mind or\r\ndestinies of mankind, we generally find a providential adaptation\r\nof the one to the other. So was it with the greatest masters of\r\nart. Had Michael Angelo appeared a century sooner, he would have\r\nfound the public unprepared, by a gradual advance of naturalism,\r\nfor the revolution which he was destined to bring about. They would\r\nhave seen in him the terrible, without perceiving how much truth\r\naccompanied it. Deprived of the sympathy and encouragement which no\r\nwayward spirit ever more demanded, he would have failed to achieve\r\nthe marvellous, and might have perhaps scarcely risen above the\r\nmonstrous. Leonardo da Vinci could, in any epoch, have given sweet or\r\nintellectual qualities to beautifully moulded features, but instead\r\nof enlightening the world upon the theory and practice of his art,\r\nand developing the infant powers of mathematical engineering, he\r\nmight in an earlier age have been an alchymist, in a later one the\r\nimprover of spinning-jennies. Titian, who would have been cramped by\r\nthe lessons of a Crivelli, grew to manhood ere the league of Cambray\r\nhad curbed the golden coursers of St. Mark's; and thus he formed\r\nhis beau-ideal of noble bearing ere the subjects for his pencil had\r\nceased to be the arbiters of Italy, the merchant-princes of the\r\nworld. A mind such as Raffaele's, would in all circumstances have\r\nfound or created materials of beauty. He might have been the purest\r\nof devotional painters in the days of Giotto, a reformer of corrupted\r\ntaste in those of Bernini; but, placed on the confines of the old\r\nmanner and the new, it was his proud distinction to perfect them both.\r\n\r\nOur antecedent remarks on the Umbrian masters have afforded us data\r\nfor ascertaining the state of painting in the duchy at the advent\r\nof Raffaele. There were, indeed, few pictures within its bounds\r\nupon which the youthful aspirant might form an exalted style, but\r\nin his father he possessed an instructor competent to point out\r\nall that was worthy of study among contemporary limners, as well\r\nas to initiate him in the mechanism of his profession.[169] Too\r\nearly was he deprived of this advantage,[*170] but not before he\r\nhad been the companion of his parent's labours. Whilst we refuse to\r\neven his precocious genius the credit of working upon the fresco at\r\nCagli,[171] the introduction of his portrait into it proves that he\r\nwitnessed its progress. It was perhaps on similar opportunities that\r\nhe imbibed, before the beautiful Madonnas of Romita and Forano, those\r\npurely devotional inspirations which are believed to have influenced\r\nhis earlier and happier creations.[172]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: See Appendix IV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *170: Giovanni died when Raphael was eleven, in 1494.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: See above, p. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: See above, p. 195-6.]\r\n\r\nWith a mind thus prepared, and with the encouraging example of the\r\nFeltrian court, where talent and genius were sure passports to\r\npatronage and distinction, he was sent to study at Perugia soon after\r\nhis father's death. This bereavement, which clouded his domestic\r\npeace not less than his artistic prospects, occurred in 1494, and\r\nwas immediately followed by the loss of his maternal grandfather\r\nand grandmother, leaving him in the hands of a selfish and litigious\r\nstepmother. At this juncture, his guardian and paternal uncle\r\nBartolomeo judiciously selected as a master for him Pietro Vannucci,\r\ncalled Perugino,[*173] the tender melancholy of whose candid and\r\nunimpassioned countenances contradict Vasari's wanton libels on\r\nhis fair name, not less than a motto on his self-limned portrait,\r\nfirst noted by Mr. Ruskin, which indicates his belief that the fear\r\nof God is the foundation of artistic excellence.[*174] Whatever\r\ndifference of opinion regarding the merits of that painter may have\r\noriginated in the occasional inequality of the works attributed to\r\nhim, no contemporary sent forth more scholars of excellence, or so\r\nfaithfully maintained the integrity of Christian sentiment against\r\never increasing innovations. Unfortunately we are possessed of no\r\nauthentic particulars regarding the interval which young Sanzio spent\r\nin a studio so congenial to his nature, or the paintings in which\r\nhe had a hand; and thus those years most important to the formation\r\nof his character and style are a blank in his biography.[*175] At\r\nPerugia and elsewhere there are a few devotional pictures ascribed\r\nto him, by tradition or as signed with his initials; but even were\r\ntheir authenticity less doubtful, their insignificance and entire\r\nconformity to the type of Perugino would almost remove them from\r\ncriticism. The admitted fact that Pinturicchio, a man of high genius,\r\nand about thirty years his senior, had recourse to the beardless\r\nRaffaele for designs, when employed to paint the cathedral-library\r\nat Siena, establishes thus early the two leading features of his\r\nafter life, supereminent ability and conciliatory manners; and two\r\nof these drawings remain to prove how superior were the conceptions\r\nof the boy, to the execution of his matured comrade, excellent as\r\nthat beyond all question is. He probably attended Perugino to Fano\r\nin 1497, when painting those lovely altar-pieces in S. Maria Nuova,\r\nwhich yield to no other production of his placid and expressive\r\npencil, although we can scarcely accept a tradition which ascribes\r\nto the pupil some Madonna groups in the predella, upon the ground of\r\ntheir excelling his master's capacity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *173: This is not so. The first master of Raphael was\r\nTimoteo Viti, who, having left home in 1490 to enter Francia's\r\nworkshop, returned to Urbino in April, 1495. Timoteo was then\r\ntwenty-six years old. There is a beautiful portrait of him by himself\r\nin the British Museum. The first undoubted work of Raphael, probably\r\npainted while he was a pupil of Timoteo, is the _Vision of a Knight_,\r\nin the National Gallery. Having served his apprenticeship to Timoteo,\r\nRaphael entered the most famous workshop in Umbria--one of a crowd of\r\npupils--that of Perugino.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *174: The suggestion that Perugino was an atheist, and died\r\nwithout the Sacraments of the Church, rests on no good foundation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *175: The first independent picture which he painted after\r\ncoming to Perugia was the _Crucifixion_, now in the possession of Mr.\r\nLudwig Mond. This was painted in 1501 or early in 1502, because the\r\nVitelli for whom it was painted were driven out of Città di Castello\r\nin the latter year. I know nothing of any return to Urbino in 1499.\r\nHe went back in 1504.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMADONNA AND CHILD\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Giovanni Santi, in the Pinacoteca of Urbino_]\r\n\r\nRaffaele is supposed to have returned in 1499 to a home where he\r\nfound few attractions. The moment was unpropitious for attracting\r\nthe ducal patronage. Guidobaldo had retired from the Bibbiena\r\ncampaign invalided and dispirited; the descent of French armies upon\r\nItaly banished from his thoughts the congenial pursuits of peace,\r\nand he repaired to Venice to take part in the coming strife. There\r\nwas little inducement for the young Sanzio to establish himself\r\nat the board of an ungracious stepmother, so he set forth to try\r\nhis fortunes at the neighbouring capital of Vitelli, and Città di\r\nCastello was enriched by the first works undertaken on his own\r\naccount. One of these, S. Nicolò di Tolentino crowned by the Madonna,\r\nhas disappeared in the rapine of the French revolutionary invasion;\r\nbut another altar-picture of the Crucifixion, lately obtained\r\nfrom the Fesch Gallery by Lord Ward, enables us to appreciate\r\nthis artist's extraordinary promise. But for the name RAPHAEL\r\nURBINAS, this would probably be ranked with the works of\r\nPerugino in which he was assisted by his pupil; and such as best\r\nknow the paintings of that master at his happiest moment, can most\r\nappreciate the compliment of classing with them the unaided though\r\nimitative efforts of a lad of seventeen. The Sposalizio of the\r\nMadonna, abstracted from Città di Castello by the French, and now at\r\nMilan, is of four years later date, being marked 1504; but it was\r\nlittle more than a repetition of a similar work of his master, which,\r\nduring the same havoc, was carried across the Alps, and remains at\r\nCaen in Normandy.[*176] The only specimen of his pencil still in the\r\ncity which was the cradle of his fame, is a processional standard of\r\nthe _confraternita de' giustiziati_ in Trinity Church, representing\r\non its two sides the Trinity with Christ on the Cross, and the\r\nCreation of Eve.[*177] Though a mere wreck, it shows a novelty of\r\ncomposition and a delicacy of execution already distinguishing him\r\nfrom the manner of Perugino.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *176: This work is a copy of Raphael's picture by Lo\r\nSpagna. Cf. BERENSON, _The Study and Criticism of Italian\r\nArt_, vol. II., p. 1-22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *177: The only work of Raphael's left in Perugia is the\r\nfresco of Christ and Saints, in St. Severo, 1505.]\r\n\r\nThe fame of these maiden efforts spread along the valley of the\r\nTiber, and the novice was soon recalled to Perugia, to paint for the\r\nOddi family an altar-piece of the Coronation of the Madonna, now with\r\nits predella in the Vatican Gallery. In rich and varied composition,\r\nit excels all antecedent representations of this favourite Umbrian\r\ntheme, and establishes a decided advance beyond the standard of\r\nbeauty adopted by Perugino. Now, too, he began his wonderful series\r\nof small devotional pictures, embodying the Madonna in conceptions of\r\nbeauty which none other but the sainted limner of Fiesole has ever\r\napproached. On this his first emancipation from Umbria, he became\r\nacquainted with the classicism and naturalism then revolutionising\r\nart. At Siena, his perception of beauty was gratified by an exquisite\r\nGrecian statuary group of the Graces, which he transferred to his\r\ntablets, and afterwards reproduced in a picture. Tempted by the\r\nproximity of Florence, he seems to have then glanced at, rather\r\nthan examined, those new elements which Masaccio and Verocchio had\r\nintroduced, and which a host of able masters were enthusiastically\r\ndeveloping.[178]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: The frequent contradictions of the many writers upon\r\nRaffaele throw a doubt upon most of his movements. Our rapid sketch\r\nhas been compiled after a careful comparison of authorities, which\r\nwe cannot stay to criticise or reconcile. *In 1504 Raphael went to\r\nFlorence. The assertion that he accompanied Pinturicchio to Siena\r\nseems a mere invention of Sienese municipal vanity.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nECCE HOMO\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Giovanni Santi in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino_]\r\n\r\nThe miserable state of his native duchy, as well as his many\r\nprofessional engagements, fully accounts for his prolonged absence\r\nfrom it; but a better state of things was now restored, of which\r\nhe hastened to avail himself. He reached Urbino in 1504, before\r\nmidsummer of which year, the Duke had returned to enjoy a tranquil\r\nhome, for the first time during above two years. The visit was well\r\ntimed, and fraught with important results to the young painter, for,\r\nbesides sharing his sovereign's patronage, he became known to his\r\nsister, widow of the Lord Prefect, and to her son, who was about that\r\ntime formally adopted as the future Lord of Urbino. The accession of\r\nJulius II., uncle to this youth, and his partiality to art, opened\r\nup a wide field of promise to one thus favourably introduced to the\r\nPope's nearest relatives. But these dazzling prospects, and the\r\ncharms of a cultivated court, were postponed to that professional\r\nimprovement for which he thirsted; and, after executing some minor\r\ncommissions for Guidobaldo, the young Sanzio hastened back to\r\nthe banks of the Arno, where the muse of painting was rewarding\r\nthe worship of her ardent and talented votaries with revelations\r\nof high art rarely before or since vouchsafed. The favour he had\r\nalready earned from the Prefectress is testified by the following\r\nrecommendation, which he received from her on setting out.\r\n\r\n     \"To the magnificent and lofty Lord, regarded with\r\n     filial respect, the Lord Gonfaloniere of Justice of the\r\n     distinguished republic of Florence.[179]\r\n\r\n     \"Magnificent and lofty Lord, respected as a father! The\r\n     bearer hereof will be Raffaele, painter of Urbino, who,\r\n     having a fine genius for his profession, has resolved to\r\n     stay some time at Florence for study. And knowing his\r\n     father to be very talented, and to possess my particular\r\n     regard, and the son to be a judicious and amiable youth, I\r\n     in every way love him greatly, and desire his attainment\r\n     in good proficiency. I therefore recommend him to your\r\n     Lordship, in the strongest manner possible, praying you,\r\n     as you love me, that you will please to afford him every\r\n     assistance and favour that he may chance to require; and\r\n     whatever such aids and obligations he may receive from\r\n     your Lordship, I shall esteem as bestowed on myself, and\r\n     as meriting my special gratitude. I commend myself to your\r\n     Lordship.\r\n\r\n     \"From Urbino, 1st October, 1504.\r\n\r\n     \"JOANNA FELTRIA DE RUVERE, Ducissa Soræ et Urbis\r\n     Prefectissa.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: Pietro Sodarini, Gonfaloniere for life. The original\r\nin Latin is printed in BOTTARI'S _Lettere sulla Pittura_,\r\nI., 1. A loose expression might lead to the conclusion that Giovanni\r\nSanzi was still alive, though he died in 1494; and on the strength of\r\nit, Rosini raises doubts as to the authenticity of the letter, or the\r\nidentity of the painter, in which we cannot join.]\r\n\r\nThis letter probably obtained him more civility than substantial\r\nbenefit; as his various Florentine works attributed to this period\r\nwere commissioned by private parties. Among these was Taddeo Taddei,\r\ncorrespondent of Bembo, and a well known friend of letters, for whom\r\nhe painted the Madonna del Cardellino and another Holy Family, and of\r\nwhose hospitalities and many favours he expresses a deep sense, in\r\nrecommending him to his uncle's good offices at Urbino, whither the\r\nFlorentine probably repaired to visit its famed court. Other kind\r\nfriends and patrons were Lorenzo Nasi and Angelo Doni; but his chief\r\nobject seems to have been the society and instructions of the best\r\npainters, which the acquaintance of his early master Perugino with\r\nFlorence, as well as his own winning manners, must have facilitated.\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, whom Giovanni Sanzi couples with Perugino, as\r\n\r\n     \"Two youths of equal years and equal love,\"\r\n\r\nwas then at the height of his fame, and in direct competition with\r\nMichael Angelo, the eventual rival of Raffaele, whose energetic\r\ngenius was already striding forward on his ambitious career.\r\nFra Bartolomeo was adapting their new and advanced style to the\r\ndevotional feeling which hung around his cloister in the frescoes\r\nof Beato Angelico. Domenico Ghirlandaio was dead, but his mantle\r\nhad fallen on a son Ridolfo, whom the young Sanzio selected as\r\nhis favourite associate, to the mutual advantage of both. In such\r\ncompanionship did Raffaele study the grand creations of preceding\r\npainters; borrowing from them, or from living artists, ideas and\r\nexpedients which his fertile genius reproduced with original\r\nembellishments. The influence of Da Vinci may be distinctly detected\r\non some of his Madonnas and portraits of this period,--that of the\r\nDominican monk on others, and on his general colouring; but the\r\nfresco of the former at S. Onofrio, and many works of the latter,\r\nprove that they reciprocated the obligation, by freely adopting\r\nhis design. Early prepossessions as yet kept him exempt from the\r\ncontagion of mythological compositions; but in portraiture he found\r\na new and interesting field, and several admirable heads, produced\r\nat Florence, attest his great success, as a naturalist of the most\r\nelevated caste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nS. SEBASTIAN\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Timoteo Viti in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino_]\r\n\r\nIn an æsthetic view, the paintings and drawings executed by Raffaele\r\nat Florence are of infinite importance, but it would lead us much too\r\nfar to examine the progressive development and naturalist tendencies\r\nwhich they display. We have not attempted to separate his various\r\nresidences there from 1504 to 1508; for during these three years and\r\na half, that city may be regarded as his head-quarters, varied by\r\nvisits to Perugia, Bologna, and Urbino, which we shall now notice.\r\nIn 1505, he was summoned to the first of these cities to execute\r\nthree altar-pictures; one of which, at Blenheim, has been beautifully\r\nengraved by Gruner[*180]; another adorns the Museo Borbonico; the\r\nthird, representing the coronation of the Madonna, is in the Vatican.\r\nOf the last commission some curious particulars are preserved.\r\nThe nuns of Monte Luce having selected the young Sanzio, on the\r\nreport of several citizens and reverend fathers, who had seen his\r\nperformances, agreed to give him for the picture 120 golden ducats,\r\nand to another artist, Berto, 80 more for the carved framework and\r\ncornice, including three predella subjects; 30 ducats of the price\r\nbeing paid in advance. Raffaele's impatience to return to his studies\r\nsoon carried him again to Florence, and a new contract for execution\r\nof the work was made in 1516; but death had removed both the abbess\r\nand the artist ere it was fulfilled, and ten years more elapsed\r\nbefore the picture was terminated by his pupils. The earliest attempt\r\nof Raffaele upon fresco, in the church of S. Severo, at Perugia,\r\nis dated 1505; its chief interest arises from being a first and\r\nincompleted idea of the grand composition which, originating with\r\nOrcagna and Fra Angelico, he developed in the Disputa of the Vatican\r\nStanze. Two years later he revisited Perugia, to paint for the\r\nBaglioni one of his noblest and most elaborate altar-pictures, which,\r\nindeed, may be regarded as his first important dramatic composition.\r\nIts subject was the Entombment; the many extant sketches for which,\r\nprove the care exercised upon the cartoon, which he prepared at\r\nFlorence. It is now the chef-d'oeuvre of the Borghese Gallery, and\r\nits beautifully pure predella is preserved in the Vatican. The\r\nsame subject was treated by Perugino, in, perhaps, the finest of his\r\npanel pictures, which now ornaments the Pitti Gallery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *180: Now in the National Gallery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nMARGHERITA \"LA FORNARINA\"\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Raphael called La Donna Velata in the Pitti\r\nGallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nWe shall not discuss whether Raffaele's acquaintance with Francia\r\nwas formed by correspondence, or during a visit to Bologna, but\r\none letter addressed by him to that charming artist is preserved,\r\nreferring to much previous intercourse, and to a friendly interchange\r\nof drawings, and of their respective portraits. Their works, at all\r\nevents, were mutually well known to each other, partly no doubt\r\nthrough Timoteo Viti, the pupil of both. It is worthy of note that\r\nSanzio, writing to this friend after quitting Florence, the hotbed of\r\nclassicism and naturalism, commends his Madonnas as \"unsurpassed in\r\nbeauty, in devotion, or in execution,\" thus showing the comparative\r\nvalue he attached to these respective excellences, among which\r\n\"truth to nature,\" the favourite test of Vasari and later critics,\r\nhas no place; and it is only when he comes to speak of the artist's\r\nown portrait, that he lauds it as \"most beautiful, and life-like\r\neven to deception.\" It was this common sentiment that linked these\r\nmaster-minds: Raffaele was in the main a devotional painter, Francia\r\nwas almost exclusively so.\r\n\r\nThe year 1506 was momentous to Urbino. In the spring Guidobaldo\r\nreturned, after a long absence from his capital, occasioned by\r\npressing solicitations of his brother-in-law the Pope, that he would\r\nremain near him. The following autumn brought the Pontiff in person\r\nto visit his relation, at whose court his Holiness spent four days.\r\nDuring part of this year, Raffaele is supposed by Passavant to have\r\nresided in his native city, and possibly he may there have been\r\npresented to Julius; at all events he must have become known to\r\nseveral members of the polished circle at Urbino, whose acquaintance\r\nere long proved useful and honourable to him at Rome, and who\r\nwere able to forward his interests, both with that Pope and his\r\nsuccessor. Such were Giuliano de' Medici, Castiglione, Bembo, and the\r\nCardinal Bibbiena, while the high tone of intellect and taste, which\r\nprevailed in that select society, was calculated to improve as well\r\nas gratify his noble nature. Nor was his pencil idle in the Duke's\r\nservice. Our information does not enable us absolutely to decide what\r\nof his Urbino works were produced on this occasion, and which of them\r\nare referable to his former visit, but we willingly adopt Passavant's\r\nclassification of the pictures he is supposed to have painted for\r\nGuidobaldo, the first three being ascribed by that author to the year\r\n1504.\r\n\r\n1. Christ in the Garden, with three disciples sleeping in the\r\ndistance, No. VIII. of Passavant's Engravings, a Peruginesque\r\npicture, \"of miniature finish\" as described by Vasari, before whose\r\ntime it had passed to the Camaldolese Convent at Urbino, having been\r\ngifted by Duchess Leonora to two members of that fraternity at her\r\nson's baptism. Long subsequently, a prior of the Gabrielli is said\r\nto have alienated it to his own family; and in 1844 it was purchased\r\nfrom the Roman prince of that name by Mr. William Coninghame, at the\r\nsale of whose interesting collection in 1849, it was acquired by Mr.\r\nFuller Maitland of Stansted in Essex.\r\n\r\n2. and 3. Two small pictures which, unless commissioned as _ex voto_\r\nofferings, belong rather to the class of romantic than devotional\r\ncompositions. They represent St. George and St. Michael subduing\r\ntheir respective monsters, allegories of their triumphs over sin. The\r\nformer of these is supposed to have been executed for Guidobaldo, and\r\npresented by him to the French King, by whom the latter was ordered\r\nas its companion. Both remain in the Louvre.\r\n\r\n4. Another St. George slaying the Dragon with a lance, while the\r\nformer one uses a sword. This picture, signed on the horse trappings\r\nRAPHELLO V., is of especial interest to our countrymen,\r\nthe Knight's knee being encircled by the Garter of England, as patron\r\nof that order: it was painted by the Duke's command in commemoration\r\nof his receiving this distinction; and in all probability was\r\ncarried as a present to Henry VII. by Castiglione, in 1506, when\r\nhe went to London as proxy at his master's installation. There it\r\ngraced the palace of the Tudors and Stuarts until sold for £150 by\r\nthe Commonwealth to Lord Pembroke. It was subsequently purchased\r\nby Catherine of Russia from the Crozat Collection, in which it is\r\nengraved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nMARGHERITA LA FORNARINA\r\n\r\n_After the spoiled picture by Raphael in the Galleria Barberini in\r\nRome_]\r\n\r\n5. and 6. Two easel pictures of the Madonna, stated by Vasari to have\r\nbeen commissioned for the Duke of Urbino, are traced by Passavant\r\nto the Imperial Gallery at St. Petersburg, and to M. Nieuwenhuys of\r\nBrussels.\r\n\r\n7. The portrait of Raffaele by himself, now in the Florence Gallery,\r\nis understood to have been executed at Urbino in 1506, whence it was\r\ncarried to Rome by Federigo Zucchero, and placed in the academy of\r\nSt. Luke, until obtained thence by the influence and gold of Cardinal\r\nLorenzo de' Medici. Passavant considers that the hair and eyes have\r\nbeen darkened by restorations, and corrects a mistake of the Canonico\r\nCrespi, who has occasioned some confusion by mistaking an old copy of\r\nit still in the Albani Palace at Urbino for a fresco, and by writing\r\nto Bottari in 1760 as if he had there discovered an original likeness\r\nof Sanzio.[*181]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *181: None of these pictures save the last seems to be from\r\nRaphael's hand.]\r\n\r\nThe Holy Family and St. John in the Ellesmere Collection, called the\r\nMadonna del Passeggio, is alleged to have been presented by a duke of\r\nUrbino to Philip II., and by him to the Emperor. Thence it is traced\r\nthrough Queen Christina to the Odescalchi and Orleans Galleries.\r\nPassavant appears to consider the Penshanger Madonna to have also\r\nbeen painted in the duchy. To the same period are ascribed missing\r\nportraits by Sanzio of Duke Guidobaldo I. and his Duchess, as well\r\nas of Bembo, Giuliano de' Medici, and others of their court.\r\n\r\nThough somewhat out of chronological order, we may here mention\r\nthe portrait of a duke of Urbino, with those of Julius II., and a\r\nMagdalene, all said to have been from his easel, and to have belonged\r\nto the ducal family, particulars of which will be found in the list\r\nof Urbino pictures in the Appendix to our third volume. It, however,\r\nseems doubtful if he ever did portray either of his successive\r\nlegitimate sovereigns; but a half-length of Lorenzo de' Medici, the\r\nusurping Duke, was purchased in Florence by the late M. Fabre about\r\ntwenty-five years ago, and is now in the museum bequeathed by him to\r\nMontpellier. It is ascribed to Raffaele, and there is a good copy of\r\nit in the hall of Baroccio at the Uffizi of Florence. We have not\r\nconnected any other works of his with Urbino, which, after the visit\r\nof 1506, he was not destined again to see.\r\n\r\nWriting from Florence to his maternal uncle, on the 21st of April,\r\n1508, he expresses his regrets for the recent death of Guidobaldo, in\r\nbrief and somewhat common-place terms; and, passing to other matters,\r\nbegs that the Duke's nephew and heir may be requested to recommend\r\nby letter his services to the Gonfaloniere, for employment on some\r\nfrescoes then in contemplation at Florence. He desires that the\r\nfavour may be asked in his own name, as essentially advantageous to\r\nhis views, specially commending himself to the young Prefect as an\r\nold servant and follower. Yet it would seem that he had already made\r\nfor himself a better title to such patronage, in a mural painting of\r\nthe Last Supper in the refectory of S. Onofrio. The recent discovery\r\nof this precious work, after centuries of oblivion, restores to him\r\nthe credit of his most important Tuscan production, and adds another\r\nto the many attractions of Florence.[*182]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *182: This is not by Raphael.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n     Raffaele is called to Rome, and employed upon the\r\n     Stanze--His frescoes there--His other works--Change in his\r\n     manner--Compared with Michael Angelo--His death, character,\r\n     and style.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter alluded to at the close of our preceding chapter may be\r\nregarded as the matured result of Raffaele's careful study of the\r\nTuscan masters, and an index of his resolution to rival the admired\r\ncartoons which had recently placed Da Vinci and Buonarroti at the\r\nhead of living artists. Another scene was, however, reserved for his\r\ntriumphs. Julius II. had begun to construct the metropolitan church\r\nand palace of Christendom with an energy befitting his character and\r\nthe undertaking. Michael Angelo and Bramante were already in his\r\nservice, and he sought to enlist talent and genius from all quarters\r\nfor this object. The friendly influence of the ducal family, the\r\nrecommendations of Bramante, or his own extending fame, possibly an\r\nacquaintance formed with him at Urbino in 1506, may have suggested\r\nRaffaele as a worthy associate in the work. On the Pope's summons\r\nhe abandoned his projects at Florence early in the autumn of 1508,\r\nand, leaving several pictures to be finished by his worthy follower\r\nRidolfo Ghirlandaio,\r\n\r\n                             \"Repaired\r\n     To the great city, an emporium then\r\n     Of golden expectations, and receiving\r\n     Freights every day from a new world of hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe tower of Borgia, named from Alexander VI., was at that period\r\nthe pontifical residence, and on its decoration the best artists\r\nhad been successfully employed. The lower story was terminated under\r\nAlexander by Pinturicchio and his pupils; the upper had already\r\nengaged the hands of Piero della Francesca, Signorelli, and Perugino,\r\nbut several of its compartments remained unpainted. One of these\r\nwas assigned to Raffaele, and so gratifying was his success that\r\nthe Pope, with headlong and unhappy haste, ordered all the finished\r\nfrescoes of the upper suite to be demolished, and the four rooms of\r\nwhich it consisted to be delivered over to his unfettered discretion.\r\nThis lamentable precipitancy effaced many works of inestimable\r\nimportance to art, and condemned the noblest productions of pictorial\r\ngenius to walls in every respect ill-adapted for their reception.\r\nThe frescoes now occupying these _stanze_ are to Italian painting\r\nwhat the Divina Commedia of Dante is to Italian poetry: the lovers\r\nof both, in despair of imitating their excellences, have expended\r\ntheir enthusiastic admiration in volumes of illustrative criticism.\r\nThese compositions of Raffaele form a magnificent epic in which\r\nare strikingly interwoven the endowments of human intellect, the\r\ndoctrines of Catholic faith, and the incidents of ecclesiastical\r\nhistory, all as conducing to the triumphs of the Christian church.\r\n\r\nThe four rooms may be regarded as four books, each subdivided\r\ninto as many themes or cantos. In the Camera della Segnatura, the\r\nceiling presents allegorical figures of Poetry, Jurisprudence,\r\nPhilosophy, and Theology, with a large composition on the side walls\r\ncorresponding to each. For Poetry we have Mount Parnassus, with\r\nApollo and the Muses on its laurel-clustered summit, surrounded by\r\nthe most famous bards and minstrels. Jurisprudence is a severely\r\nsimple group, consisting of Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude,\r\nthe virtues by which justice is promoted on earth; while the\r\ntext-books of Roman and Canon law are issued by Justinian and\r\nGregory IX., in subsidiary panels. Philosophy is embodied in the\r\nfamous School of Athens, as it has been incorrectly named, where\r\nfifty figures, attending a scholastic disputation between Plato\r\nand Aristotle, include the noblest names of ancient science, the\r\nselection of whom displays extraordinary knowledge of the history\r\nof mind. Theology, generally called the Disputa del Sacramento,\r\nis divided into two scenes. Seated in the heavens amid an angelic\r\nchoir, the Holy Trinity is surrounded by the Madonna, the Precursor,\r\nand a glorified assemblage of patriarchs, prophets, and warriors of\r\nthe Old Testament; apostles, evangelists, and martyrs of the New\r\nDispensation. Below, the fathers of the Church and its most eminent\r\ndivines expound to an audience of distinguished personages the\r\nmysteries of faith, which are symbolised by the Eucharist exposed\r\nupon an elevated altar in token of man's redemption.\r\n\r\nThe stanza called that of Heliodorus has on the roof four signal\r\nmanifestations of himself by the Almighty to the patriarchs. The\r\nfirst mural compartment represents the holiest mystery of the Romish\r\nfaith established in the Miracle of Bolsena, whereby a doubting\r\npriest was supernaturally convinced of the divine presence in\r\ntransubstantiation. Opposite is the miraculous deliverance from\r\nprison of St. Peter, the founder of the Romish Church; and the\r\ntwo corresponding subjects illustrate the power committed to his\r\nsuccessors for arresting the invasion of pagan force personified in\r\nAttila, and for cleansing from the temple of Christ its sacrilegious\r\nplunderers, with Heliodorus at their head.\r\n\r\nHaving thus illustrated the divine origin of man's chief faculties,\r\nand of ecclesiastical authority, Raffaele in the two remaining rooms\r\nexchanged allegory for historical delineation. That called the Stanza\r\ndel Incendio shows us the Coronation of Charlemagne by Leo III., and\r\nthe justification of that Pontiff on oath in presence of the same\r\nEmperor; the Victory of Leo IV. over the Saracens at Ostia, and his\r\nsupernaturally staying a conflagration which threatened the basilicon\r\nof St. Peter,--a theme belonging rather to the category of the\r\nsecond room. The ceiling here, having been executed by Perugino, and\r\nreverently spared by Raffaele from the sweeping sentence of Julius,\r\nhas no immediate bearing upon these subjects, though full of fervid\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nThe last and largest of the suite is called the Hall of Constantine,\r\nwhose religious history is there delineated in four leading scenes:\r\nhis Baptism, by St. Silvester; his Vision of the Cross before Battle;\r\nhis Victory over Maxentius at the Ponte Milvio; and his Donation of\r\nRome and its temporalities to the successors of St. Peter. The roof,\r\nof posterior date and far inferior merit, has nothing to do with\r\nRaffaele's creations.\r\n\r\nThis meagre outline may indicate the leading theme of these the\r\ngrandest compositions of modern art; but to form an idea of their\r\ndifficulties, of the varied and profound knowledge they display, of\r\nthe many noble episodes they embrace, and of all the interesting\r\nportraits they embody, demands no brief or light study, no ordinary\r\nlearning or accomplishment. Nor is it easy to appreciate their\r\ntechnical merits or artistic beauties, vast as is their extent, with\r\nbaffling and insufficient cross-lights, and a surface considerably\r\nimpaired. Hence the general disappointment felt by casual and\r\nsuperficial visitors, and the superior gratification afforded\r\nby good engravings of the series. In these, and in the not less\r\nperfect tapestry-cartoons which it is the privilege of our country\r\nto possess, may be appreciated Raffaele's unity of composition, his\r\nsymmetrical and unostentatious design, his full contours and flowing\r\nlines, and the earnest but unaffected sensibility which distinguishes\r\nhis transcendent works.\r\n\r\nThat the whole sixteen mural paintings and two of the ceilings were\r\ndesigned by Raffaele is beyond question; the portions executed by\r\nhimself, and those assigned to his pupils, are matter of keen\r\ncontroversy, upon which we need not enter. It is, however, agreed\r\nthat the Camera della Segnatura, and half that of Heliodorus, belong\r\nto the reign of Julius, whilst the Stanza del Incendio was painted\r\nunder Leo X., when Sanzio's manifold employments and commissions\r\nobliged him to entrust too much to his scholars. Of the Sala di\r\nCostantino only two figures, painted in oil as an experiment, had\r\nbeen finished when premature death closed his career of glory. The\r\nprice allowed for each fresco seems to have been about 1200 ducats of\r\ngold.[183] Theology, the earliest of the series, painted immediately\r\non his arrival at Rome, has most of the freshness and devotional\r\nsentiment of his early genius and Umbrian education. It and the\r\nPhilosophy are most pregnant with abstruse scholarship, drawn in\r\npart from the learned companionship of Duke Guidobaldo's court. The\r\nglowing and harmonious colouring of the Heliodorus, and Miracle of\r\nBolsena fully equals any known production of Venetian art; and in the\r\nIncendio, the Heliodorus, and the Battle of Maxentius, we have the\r\nenergy and vigour of Michael Angelo, without his exaggerations. In\r\nall may be seen the vast stride he had made from the timid Cenacolo\r\nat Florence, while his transition from Peruginesque hatching to a\r\nfull and free streak, and a bold handling, is particularly traceable\r\nin the Disputa, which Passavant justly characterises as surpassing\r\nevery antecedent effort of pictorial art.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: FEA, _Notizie_, p. 9. Raffaele's own letter\r\nof 1514 mentions that sum for each Stanza.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Julius II. in 1513, eventually proved nowise detrimental\r\nto Raffaele's advancement; for the new Pope not only followed out\r\nthose decorations which he found in progress at the Vatican, but soon\r\nmade new calls upon their artist, whose labours during the remaining\r\nseven years of his short span appear almost beyond belief. Of the\r\nStanze, ten new subjects were composed, and several of them in part\r\nexecuted by him in that time, besides the architecture and all the\r\nelaborate decoration of the Loggie, the finished cartoons for twelve\r\nor thirteen large tapestries, the decorations of the Farnesina,\r\nBibbiena, Lante, Madama, and Magliana villas, the frescoes of Sta.\r\nMaria della Pace, the Chigi Chapel in Sta. Maria del Popolo, a\r\nvariety of altar and cabinet pictures, including his Madonnas of San\r\nSisto and del Pesce, the Sta. Cecilia, and, last but most glorious\r\nof all, the Transfiguration; besides numerous portraits, and many\r\ndrawings for the burin of Marcantonio. Add to this a journey to\r\nFlorence in 1514, his architectural designs for several palaces there\r\nand at Rome, a general superintendence of the antiquities in and\r\naround the Eternal City, and the principal charge of the building of\r\nSt. Peter's, at a yearly salary of 300 scudi.\r\n\r\nThe necessary results of thus over-taxing mind and body was\r\nprejudicial to the quality of the works, and to the constitution\r\nof their author. His paintings, left in a great measure to pupils,\r\noften showed a hurried and inferior execution, ill compensated\r\nby the broader treatment which he was forced to adopt. The\r\nmetropolitan fabric, itself an ample occupation for the highest\r\ngenius and constant industry of one man, languished under inadequate\r\nsuperintendence. The delicate frame of Raffaele, exhausted by mental\r\nfatigue, was incapable of resisting the first attack of disease.\r\n\r\nBut brief and utterly imperfect as this sketch has hitherto been, we\r\nmust now greatly curtail it, and pass by many of his most glorious\r\nundertakings, to touch upon one or two general views.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE SPOSALIZIO\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Raphael, once in the Ducal Collection at\r\nUrbino, now in the Brera, Milan_]\r\n\r\nThe devotional influences of the Umbrian school, from which Raffaele\r\nmust have imbibed his youthful impressions, were reproduced in his\r\njuvenile works under forms of loveliness new to that mountain land.\r\nHis visits to Florence offered fresh inspirations, and taught him\r\nto ingraft upon the conventionalities of Christian art, whatever\r\nhis keen sense of beauty could cull from the creations of beneficent\r\nNature. But he painted her and all her works,\r\n\r\n     \"Not as they are, but as they ought to be;\"\r\n\r\nnothing mean or debasing found a place in his inventions, and homely\r\naccessories were either refined or thrown into shade. On the banks of\r\nthe Arno he became acquainted with another class of elegant forms,\r\nwherein the ancients had developed a beau-ideal, faultless in its\r\nexternal qualities, but alien to religious sentiment. The reaction\r\nagainst paganism, which Savonarola's eloquence had effected in the\r\nTuscan capital, contributed perhaps to save Raffaele from this snare;\r\nbut at the court of Rome, and more especially under the Medicean\r\nLeo, the temptation became too strong. Before the twofold seduction\r\nof incarnate beauty and classic forms, the types of his pristine\r\nadmiration were gradually effaced, and his fidelity to them waxed\r\nfaint. After elevating Christian painting to its culminating point,\r\nhe lent himself unwittingly to its degradation, by selecting depraved\r\nloveliness equally for a Madonna or a Venus, by designing from it\r\nindiscriminately a Galatea or a saint. True, that what he lost in\r\npurity is, in the opinion of many, more than counterbalanced by his\r\nprogress towards breadth and vigour; but without entering upon so\r\nwide an element of controversy, we may note the fact that, though\r\nall his pupils boldly followed that \"new manner,\" their career was\r\none of rapid descent, and that those who departed most widely from\r\ntheir master's purest conceptions have obtained least admiration from\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nYet we must in a great measure acquit Raffaele of participating in\r\nthe corruption which he shrank from combating. No work of depraved\r\ntaste or immoral tendency has been brought home to his pencil,\r\nthough the dissolute habits of his age readily applauded such\r\nlibertinism in Giulio Romano, Titian, and Correggio. As to the\r\nlong current statement, that his premature death was a well-earned\r\nresult of vicious indulgences, the evidence, when sifted by\r\nrecent research, entitles him to at least a negative verdict. No\r\ncontemporary testimony gives the slightest countenance to the charge.\r\nIt originated in a vague and random sentence of a commentator upon\r\nAriosto, wherein four assertions out of six are palpably unfounded,\r\nand its gossiping character procured it a too ready admission from\r\nVasari. The pure character of his works meets it with an effectual\r\ncontradiction, on which those who best understand physiological\r\nconformation will most implicitly rely:--\r\n\r\n     \"Love is too earthly, sensual for his dream;\r\n       He looks beyond it with his spirit eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAnother allegation remains to be examined, more detrimental to the\r\nartist, though less so to the man. During his progress through\r\nvarious styles, and in the composition of many works, Raffaele is\r\nsaid to have freely appropriated the ideas of others. There can\r\nscarcely be a doubt that his Graces were suggested by the antique\r\nmarble at Siena; that several noble conceptions were transferred by\r\nhim from the Carmine to the Vatican; that a group in the Incendio del\r\nBorgo was borrowed from Virgil's Trojan epic; that the arabesques of\r\nthe Loggie were partly taken from the thermal corridors of Titus;\r\nand that other still more curious resemblances have been detected\r\nby an acute writer to whom we have already referred.[184] But such\r\nappropriations were established by authoritative precedents, from\r\nthe conventionalities of Christian painting to the plagiarisms\r\nof Michael Angelo. The right to repeat themselves or others was\r\nrecognised, though men of high genius rarely stooped to its absolute\r\nexercise. Raffaele,--\"always imitating, always original,\" if we\r\nfollow Sir Joshua's not unbiased strictures,--will accordingly be\r\nfound, on closer examination, to have adapted rather than adopted\r\nthe thoughts of others. Like the busy bee, culling sweets from every\r\nflower, he separated the honey from the wax, and reproduced, in new\r\nshapes and varied combinations, whatever of beauty he met with in\r\nnature or art. We may add another dictum of Sir Joshua,--\"his known\r\nwealth was so great, that he might borrow where he pleased without\r\nloss of credit.\" These considerations seem fairly applicable to the\r\ninfluence exercised by Michael Angelo upon a few works of Sanzio.\r\nBut if not the canon of criticism must be impartially administered.\r\nWhen the vigour of Buonarroti is adjudged to have been filched from\r\nSignorelli, his stalwart anatomy acknowledged as the legacy of\r\nPollaiuolo; when Domenichino stands arraigned for transferring to\r\nhis chef-d'oeuvre, the communion of St. Jerome, the exact motive\r\nand theme of his master, Ludovico Caracci's canvas in the Pinacoteca\r\nat Bologna, it will be time to admit Reynolds's proposition, that\r\n\"it is to Michael Angelo we owe even the existence of Raffaele,\r\nand that to him Raffaele owes the grandeur of his style.\" Sanzio,\r\nin truth, shrank not from competing with whatever he deemed worthy\r\nof emulation. But his was a fair and friendly rivalry, however\r\nlittle its spirit was understood or reciprocated by the wayward and\r\noverbearing Florentine, whose charge against Raffaele and Bramante\r\nof undermining him with Julius II., adduced in an idle letter, is\r\nnot only contradicted by the character of these great men, but it\r\nis palpably improbable. To their influence, Buonarroti ascribes the\r\nsuspension of that Pontiff's tomb, regarding which we shall have\r\nmuch to say in our fifty-third chapter. But as neither of them were\r\nsculptors, and as the Florentine was not yet known to the Pope,\r\neither as an architect or a painter, such jealousy would have been\r\nabsurd; whilst the taunt of Sanzio's owing all he knew of art to\r\nMichael Angelo can only be regarded as the petty ebullition of a\r\nnotoriously wayward temper. The employment of the latter upon the\r\nhuge bronze statue of his Holiness at Bologna, was the real reason\r\nfor the interruption of the monument, which it was reserved for Duke\r\nFrancesco Maria I. to have completed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: _Quarterly Review_, No. cxxxi. pp. 20, 25, 32, 42.]\r\n\r\nBetween these great masters no parallel can be fairly drawn, and\r\nhad they wrought in the same town they would seldom have been\r\nplaced in rivalry. But belonging to different states, and heading\r\nthe antagonist schools of Rome and Florence, the sectional spirit\r\nof Italy has placed them in contrast, and has adopted their names\r\nas watchwords of local jealousy. In truth, Raffaele's advancement\r\nin anatomical accuracy was a necessary consequence of the growing\r\nnaturalism of his time; and the improvement could not fail to\r\ndevelop the breadth of his pencil, as well as to enlarge the sphere\r\nof his compositions. The absolute amelioration of his works, after\r\nhe settled at Rome, was therefore inevitable from the spirit of\r\nthe age acting upon a genius not yet matured. That spirit Michael\r\nAngelo exaggerated rather than embodied; and to the purer taste of\r\nhis rival many of his productions must have been beacons rather\r\nthan models. There is, indeed, some truth, with much malice, in the\r\nsarcasm of Pietro Aretino, that the former painted porters, the\r\nlatter gentlemen. Induced, perhaps, by some such idle sneer, Raffaele\r\nexecuted his Isaiah, to prove that the new manner was not beyond\r\nhis grasp; but this, his first, and fortunately his last work, in\r\nwhich a direct imitation of the terrible Florentine is discernible,\r\nis now the least admired of his mural paintings; and some portion\r\nof its Michael Angelesque character has even been attributed to the\r\nafter-restorations of Daniele di Volterra. The Poetry in the Stanze\r\nand the frescoes in the church of La Pace, which he has been supposed\r\nto have borrowed from the same source, are traced by more recent\r\ncritics to works of Andrea l'Ingegno at Perugia and Assisi. After\r\nthese observations, it is scarcely requisite to notice the remark\r\nof Vasari regarding the opportunity stealthily afforded to Raffaele\r\nby Bramante for plagiarising from his rival's gigantic creations on\r\nthe roof of the Cappella Sistina. The casual manner in which the\r\nallusion is made does not warrant its being taken up, as it has been,\r\nin the light of a charge against the honour both of Sanzio and his\r\nfriend; and even had it been so intended by the Florentine, various\r\ncircumstances, besides the high character of those inculpated, are\r\nsufficient to negative the charge. If Raffaele followed Buonarroti's\r\nmanner, it must be admitted that he alone did so without thereby\r\ndeteriorating his own. Nor ought we to forget that most critics by\r\nwhom this question is handled have merely repeated the loose views\r\nof the biographer of Arezzo, whose great aim it was to prove that\r\nthe excellences of Sanzio were all borrowed from his Florentine\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe parallel which suggests itself between these gifted\r\ncompetitors[*185] has been thus stated with equal eloquence and\r\ntruth: \"The genius of Michael Angelo differed from that of Raffaele\r\neven more in kind than in degree; limited in its object, but intense\r\nin its energy, it gloried in the exhibition of its own colossal\r\nstrength, and looked with contempt on those gentler graces that\r\nwaited unbidden on the pencil of their favourite worshipper. When the\r\nrivals approached, it was by no common movement; Michael Angelo stood\r\naloof on the lofty eminence he had chosen; it was Raffaele alone who\r\ndared at times to traverse the wide space that divided them. So great\r\nwere the difficulties, so bold the attempt, that all his success,\r\nrapid and wonderful as it was, would have seemed almost necessary\r\nto rescue a character less modest and unassuming than his, from the\r\ncharge of hardihood and presumption. With a noble candour he could\r\nscarcely have learned from his haughty antagonist, Raffaele was among\r\nthe first to see, the most prompt to acknowledge, the new grandeur\r\nhe had given to art.... Even when he rises to the very confines of\r\nsublimity, it is still the sublimity of the beautiful; and when\r\nMichael Angelo stoops for a brief space to court the aid of beauty,\r\nit serves like a transparent veil to soften rather than conceal the\r\nnative sublimity of his genius.... Michael Angelo, the painter of\r\nthe old covenant, has embodied his genius in the stern and gigantic\r\nforms of Moses and the Prophets; but he failed where Raffaele has\r\nshown as signally his skill, in the gentle dignity of the Saviour\r\nand the heavenly purity of a mother's love.... In his paintings, as\r\nin his character, there appears an unconsciousness of excellence,\r\na consummation of art carried up to the simplicity of nature, that\r\nanticipates criticism, and allows us to indulge undisturbed in a\r\nfulness of admiration, which grows on the reason long after it has\r\nsatisfied the heart. In Michael Angelo's best works there is often,\r\non the contrary, somewhat so strange and so studied in gesture\r\nand attitude, so evident a design upon our wonder, as almost to\r\nprovoke us to resistance, and impair the pure magic of the effect by\r\nattracting our attention to the cause.\"[186]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *185: Far from the parallel \"suggesting itself,\" only a\r\ndisorderly mind would make it. No comparison is thinkable between\r\nwork that is absolutely different. One might as well compare a valley\r\nwith the sea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: _British and Foreign Quarterly_, vol. XIII.]\r\n\r\nHonoured by the Pontiff and his brilliant court, idolised by a band\r\nof enthusiastic pupils, engrossed by distinguished commissions,\r\nRaffaele had few thoughts to bestow on his early home. His ties\r\nthere had become few and feeble. His father's house had entirely\r\nfailed; his only near relation was a maternal uncle, who retained\r\nhis warm affection, and scarcely survived him. In writing to that\r\nuncle in 1514, to acquaint him with his signal success and augmenting\r\nwealth, he desires special commendations to the Duke and Duchess,\r\nmodestly suggesting that they might be pleased to hear how one\r\nof their servants was doing himself honour. Gratifying as his\r\nextending reputation must have been to them, we find no trace of\r\nspecial exertions on their part to promote it. Indeed, they had ample\r\noccupation on their own concerns, in the revolution which soon after\r\nexiled them during the rest of Leo's pontificate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISABELLA OF ARAGON\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Raphael in the Louvre_]\r\n\r\nOne of Raffaele's best patrons was Agostino Chigi, a Sienese banker,\r\nwho, after a most successful career at Rome, became in the prime\r\nof life the millionaire of his day, and who employed his great\r\nwealth, and the preponderating influence it gave him with the papal\r\ngovernment, in a judicious promotion of art. His commissions to\r\nRaffaele include the mural paintings of his chapel in the Madonna\r\ndella Pace, the architecture, sculpture, and mosaics of his other\r\nchapel in the Madonna del Popolo, and the architecture and internal\r\ndecorations of his urban villa, now the Farnesina. The last has a\r\nmelancholy interest, from being the latest work which exercised the\r\ncares of the illustrious artist. Whilst superintending its frescoes\r\nin March, 1520,[187] a summons from the Pope brought him with hurried\r\nsteps to the Vatican, where, arriving overheated, he was detained in\r\na large and chilly saloon until perspiration was checked. An attack\r\nof fever naturally followed, which, advancing to the stage called\r\npernicious, proved too much for his delicate and over-excited frame,\r\nespecially when still further exhausted by injudicious bleeding, in a\r\nbelief that the attack was pleurisy. Aware of his danger, he sought\r\nsupport in his hour of need from the ministrations of religion and\r\nthe rites of his Church. Such is the now received account. The most\r\nauthentic particulars are contained in a letter, dated from Rome five\r\ndays after his death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Yet this casino, begun in 1511, is by some said to\r\nhave been completed several years before.]\r\n\r\n\"About ten o'clock on Good Friday night [April 6th] died Raffaele of\r\nUrbino, the most gentle and most eminent painter, to the universal\r\nregret of all, but especially of the learned.... Envious death,\r\ncutting short his beautiful and laudable undertakings, has torn\r\nfrom us this master, still young, upon his very natal day. The Pope\r\nhimself indulges in uncontrolled grief, and, during the fifteen\r\ndays of his illness, sent at least six times to visit and console\r\nhim.... We have, indeed, been bereaved of one of rare excellence,\r\nwhose loss every noble spirit ought to bewail and lament, not simply\r\nwith passing words, but in studied and lasting elegies. He is said\r\nto have left 16,000 ducats, including 5000 in cash, to be divided\r\nfor the most part among his friends and household; the house of\r\nBramante,[188] which he purchased for 3000 ducats, he has given to\r\nthe Cardinal [Bibbiena] of S. Maria in Portico. He was buried at the\r\nRotonda, whither he was borne by a distinguished cortège. His soul\r\nis beyond a doubt gone to contemplate those heavenly mansions where\r\nno trouble enters, but his memory and his name will linger long on\r\nearth, in his works and in the minds of virtuous men.--Much less\r\nloss, in my opinion, though the populace may think otherwise, has\r\nthe world sustained in the death of Agostino Chigi last night, as\r\nto which I say little, not yet having heard of his affairs. I have\r\nonly learned that, between cash, debts owing to him, securities,\r\nalum-mines, real estate, bank capital, appointments, bullion, and\r\njewels, he has left eight millions of golden ducats.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: It stood in front of St. Peter's, and was removed when\r\nthe piazza was extended.]\r\n\r\nIt may be that Raffaele was timeously taken from the evil to come;\r\nsince death exempted him from witnessing like Michael Angelo, a\r\ndeluge of mediocrity he would have been powerless to withstand.\r\nBut the blow was deadened by no such calculation, and seldom have\r\nobsequies so pompous been accompanied by grief as universal. By the\r\nbier, around which his funeral rites were celebrated, there was\r\nhung his great picture of the Transfiguration: the inspired beauty\r\nof its upper portion, and the unfinished state of the remainder,\r\nmost touchingly testified his almost superhuman powers, and their\r\nuntimely extinction. The place of his sepulture was behind an altar\r\nin the Pantheon Church, for the erection and endowment of which he\r\nprovided by testamentary bequest, and where his bones have of late\r\nbeen reverently but unwarrantably disturbed. This selection appears\r\nto have been dictated by the recent interment near the spot of Maria\r\nBibbiena, the grand-niece of his friend the Cardinal, to whom he had\r\nbeen betrothed, and who had lately predeceased him. The little that\r\nwe know of this engagement is from the painter's own letter to his\r\nuncle in 1514; and it would seem to have been sought by the Cardinal\r\nrather than by the bridegroom, who appears to have abandoned his\r\nmatrimonial arrangements to friendly match-makers with more than\r\nItalian indifference. The idle tale of his looking to a Cardinal's\r\nhat is now set at rest, as well as nearly all the gossip that had\r\nlong circulated as to his supposed dissolute habits, and his liason\r\nwith that Roman matron whose ample contours and rich flesh-tints have\r\ncome down to us on his canvasses, and who, whether his mistress or\r\nnot (examples of such licence being then almost universal), seems to\r\nhave been a favourite model in his school.[189]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Passavant treats the usual legends regarding the\r\nFornarina as after inventions, and ascribes the earliest notice of\r\nher to PUCCINI'S _Real Galleria di Firenze_, I., p. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe same pure taste and feeling for beauty, which characterise\r\nthe frescoes and pictures of Sanzio, would have raised him to\r\nequal excellence in other branches of art. They are visible in\r\nhis architectural compositions, and in his numerous drawings. The\r\nstatue of Jonah in the Sta. Maria del Popolo, supposed to have been\r\nmodelled, if not wrought, by his hand, proves what he might have\r\nattained in sculpture. He had no time for literary undertakings, but\r\nsome sonnets, casually preserved on the back of his sketches, exhibit\r\nhim as a cultivator of letters. An interesting result of his official\r\ncharge of the antique monuments remains in an eloquent report to the\r\nPope, in which,\r\n\r\n     \"Rome's ancient genius, o'er its ruins spread,\r\n     Shakes off the dust, and rears its reverend head.\"\r\n\r\nIts authorship has given rise to some controversy, and it seems not\r\nunlikely that the materials supplied by Raffaele were thrown into\r\nshape by his friend Castiglione.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting as well as easy to adduce from contemporary\r\npens proofs of the general admiration for his talents, and popularity\r\nof his manners. But we close this notice, too brief for the subject,\r\nthough already exceeding our due limits, with the testimony of his\r\nearliest biographer, and of one of his most recent critics. Vasari\r\nthus commences his life of Sanzio: \"The great bounty which Providence\r\noccasionally displays, in heaping upon a single individual an\r\nunlimited measure of favours, and all the rare gifts and graces which\r\ngenerally are distributed over a long interval and many characters,\r\nmay well be seen in Raffaele Sanzio of Urbino. Equally worthy and\r\nengaging, he was endowed with a modesty and goodness sometimes united\r\nin those who, adding to a certain noble refinement of disposition\r\nthe attraction of amiable manners, are gracious and pleasing at all\r\ntimes and with all persons. Nature presented him to the world when,\r\nalready vanquished in art by the hand of Michael Angelo, she wished\r\nto be outdone by Raffaele, alike in art and in courtesy. In him she\r\nluminously displayed the most singular excellences, conjoined with\r\nsuch diligence, discretion, grace, comeliness, and good breeding, as\r\nmight have concealed even the greatest blemish, or the most hideous\r\nvice. Hence it may safely be asserted, that those who possess such\r\nrare qualities as were united in Raffaele of Urbino are not mere\r\nhuman creatures, but rather, if such language be allowable, mortal\r\ndivinities.\" Still more eloquent is the passage lamenting his\r\nuntimely death: \"Oh, happy and blessed spirit, every one delights to\r\ntalk of you, to dwell upon your actions, and to admire every design\r\nwhich you have left. Well might the art of painting die when this her\r\nnoble child was called away; for when his eyes were closed she was\r\nleft all but blind. To us, his survivors, it now remains to follow\r\nthe example of his excellent manner, cherishing in our memory, and\r\ntestifying by our words, the remembrance due to his worth and our\r\nown gratitude. For in truth we have colouring, invention, indeed the\r\nwhole art brought by him to a perfection hardly to have been looked\r\nfor; nor need any genius ever think to surpass him.\" In the words of\r\na writer upon whom we have already drawn:--\"Cut down in the flower of\r\nhis age, and,--like a favoured tree of his own most favoured land,\r\nwhile laden with golden fruit, bearing in still unopened blossoms\r\nthe promise of a yet brighter future,--he was mourned widely as he\r\nwas admired, deeply and truly as he had been loved. Young as he was\r\nin years, and modest in his bearing, there is a feeling of reverence\r\nblended in the fond regret with which even strangers dwell upon his\r\nmemory, recount his virtues, and seek to read their impress and\r\nreflection in his works.\"[190]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: _British and Foreign Review_, vol. XIII., p. 274.]\r\n\r\nA critical examination of the peculiar merits of Raffaele's pencil,\r\nand of the benefits which he brought to art, would lead us further\r\nthan this sketch will permit: yet there are certain points so\r\napparent even to superficial observers, some qualities so unanimously\r\ndwelt upon by his eulogists, that it would be incomplete without\r\na passing notice of them. To him the perception of beauty was a\r\nsixth sense, ever in exercise, and applied to the creations of his\r\ngenius, as well as to his studies from nature. To its test were\r\nsubmitted those traditional forms of devotional art which influenced\r\nhis early training; it imparted life and movement to Perugino's\r\nso-called monotonous poverty; it modified the dramatic action of the\r\nFlorentine manner; it caught the full tones of Fra Bartolomeo, and\r\ngave dignity to the simper of Leonardo; it showed that anatomical\r\naccuracy required no muscular contortions; it realised the grand\r\nwithout verging upon the monstrous; it separated grace from grimace.\r\nThis was an innate and personal gift, that could neither be taught\r\nnor imitated. The elevated character, harmonious composition, correct\r\ndesign, and just colouring which Raffaele stamped upon his school,\r\nwere manifested in various degrees by his pupils, but the spirit of\r\ntheir master was a boon from nature, which none of them could seize\r\nor inherit. There are impetuous and daring minds who delight more\r\nin the energy of Michael Angelo's terrible forms; others luxuriate\r\nwith greater fondness on the mellowed depth of Titian's magic tints;\r\nwhilst to some the artificial contrasts of Correggio's brilliant\r\nlights, and Leonardo's unfathomable _chiaroscuri_ have irresistible\r\ncharm. These eminent qualities are, however, the separate endowments\r\nof four individual minds; but Raffaele, deficient in none of them,\r\npossessed, in no less perfection, other more important requisites\r\nwhich we have noticed. It was this happy union that rendered him the\r\nunquestioned prince of painters, while the ready obedience of his\r\nunerring hand enabled him to realise the pure conceptions of his\r\nrefined mind with a delicacy and truth which seem to defy imitation.\r\n\r\nYet his sterling merit was undeviating propriety in the conception\r\nand execution of his works. Nothing ever emanated from his pencil\r\noffensive to religion, morals, or refinement; all that bears his\r\nname would honour the most fastidious reputation. To him accordingly\r\nthere was granted a purity of taste, in none other united to equal\r\ngenius. It was this that maintained the elevation of his style amid\r\nthe conflicting difficulties and temptations of that \"new manner\"\r\nwhich it was his mission to perfect. Thus, although it is in the\r\nproductions of his second period that we find the beau-ideal most\r\nperfectly realised, yet, even his later works, which descend to\r\na closer imitation of nature, seldom fail to invest her with a\r\ndignity rare in the external world. In proportion, therefore, as he\r\ndiscovered or adopted the more elaborate resources and processes of\r\nhis art, his ripening mind supplied him with themes and conceptions\r\nworthy of them, and of immortality. The various series of subjects\r\nwhich he invented for the Stanze, the Tapestries, and the Loggie,\r\nindicate a grasp of intelligence, a variety of acquirement, never\r\nbefore or since brought into the service of art, and establish\r\nbeyond question that the intellect of Raffaele fully equalled his\r\ntaste.[*191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *191: Raphael seems to us to-day to have been a supreme\r\nportrait painter. His other easel pictures, splendid as they often\r\nare in \"space composition,\" seem to lack sincerity. His frescoes have\r\na perfect decorative value, but little force or real contact with\r\nlife. If they sum up the Renaissance, they do so only in part, with\r\nmuch sacrifice of truth and of that virility and assured contact of\r\nlife which were its most precious possessions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n     Timoteo Viti--Bramante--Andrea Mantegna--Gian\r\n     Bellini--Justus of Ghent--Medals of Urbino.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced the advance of painting in the duchy of Urbino,\r\nfrom Oderigi da Gubbio, the friend of Dante, to Raffaele Sanzio,\r\nits _facile princeps_, it might be well to pause, and leave its\r\nrapid descent under a new dynasty of dukes to be followed in a\r\nfuture portion of our work. Yet there are still some native names,\r\nbelonging to the better period both by date and by merit. Of these\r\nthe principal was TIMOTEO VITI, who was born of reputable\r\nparentage in Urbino about 1470, and whose mother Calliope was\r\ndaughter of Antonio Alberti of Ferrara, by whom the Giottesque\r\nmanner had been brought to that city. Timoteo was sent to Bologna to\r\nprofit by the instructions of Francesco Francia, and remained there\r\nfrom 1490 to 1495. The Christian painters of that city had chosen\r\nfor their Madonnas a peculiar type, which, after being transmitted\r\nthrough several artists, attained its perfection from Francia's\r\npencil. It may be distinctly traced in the best remaining specimen\r\nof Lippo Dalmasio, of whom we have already spoken,[192] a lunette in\r\nfresco, representing the Madonna and Child between two saints, which\r\nis over the door of S. Procul at Bologna. There we find a pensive\r\ncast of head gently bent on one side in dreamy contemplation,--the\r\nsweetly naïve features, with less indeed of a divine or seraphic\r\nexpression than we see in those imagined by the Florentine and\r\nSienese masters, but whose look seems to indicate that, though\r\nof earth, their owner was not earthy,--though a child of fallen\r\nhumanity, she had not tasted of actual guilt. Those who know the\r\nMadonnas of Francia need not be told that they resemble sinless\r\nwomen more than beautiful beings. Somewhat of the same sentiment\r\nmay be traced in the earlier productions of Timoteo Viti. Thus his\r\nMagdalen, which, though now in the Pinacoteca of Bologna, was painted\r\nfor Urbino, is a grand figure in red drapery largely cast, standing\r\nin front of a wide cavern. Her girlish countenance appears too pure\r\nand gentle to have felt carnal passion, too placid to have wept over\r\nhuman sin; her reverential attitude aspires heavenward, without, like\r\nmost of her class, appearing to loathe the earth. The mild character\r\nof Timoteo, as well as his promising talents, established him in\r\nthe friendship of his master, whose diary touchingly records the\r\naffection with which he bade god-speed to his pupil, on quitting his\r\nstudio.[193]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: See above, p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: \"On the 4th April, 1495, my dear Timoteo went away,\r\nto whom may God grant all good and success.\" He seems to have been\r\nreceived at first into Francia's \"workshop\" as a goldsmith, to work\r\nfor the first year without pay, the second at sixteen florins a\r\nquarter, the last to be free, working by the piece. This indenture\r\nwas, however, broken by mutual consent after fourteen months, on his\r\nwish to pass into the painters' studio.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nST. SEBASTIAN\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Timoteo Viti in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino_]\r\n\r\nFew of this painter's early works are identified, and no frescoes\r\nfrom his designs appear to survive; but his altar-picture painted\r\nfor the Bonaventura chapel in the church of S. Bernardino at Urbino,\r\nand now by the hazards of war in the Brera at Milan, offers one of\r\nthe most remarkable compositions of the age. The Annunciation, that\r\ngraceful theme of Christian art, had hitherto been treated upon one\r\nuniform type, and though ever attractive was generally trite. The\r\nVirgin surprised by her heavenly visitor was a subject requiring, in\r\ncontrast, the purest earthly and celestial beauty which the painter\r\ncould invent. The early masters sought not to introduce any other\r\ncharacter than that of hallowed loveliness, refined from worldly\r\nsentiment; their successors added what was meant for grace of manner,\r\nwhich in their hands generally fell into affected mannerism. Timoteo\r\nheld a middle course, giving play to his fancy, but restraining its\r\nflight by the spell of holy reverence. Amid a fine and far-stretching\r\nlandscape stands the Virgin, nobly beautiful, gazing with prayerful\r\naspect upon an angel, whose demi-figure issues from a cloud.\r\nFar above her head the infant Saviour, supported by a dove in a\r\ntriangular halo of dazzling splendour, descends from the skies to\r\nbecome incarnate in the womb of Mary; his foot poised upon a globe,\r\nand the cross resting in his left hand, whilst his right is raised\r\nin benediction. The archangel with out-stretched arms indicates the\r\nmother to the child, and the child to the mother, thus beautifully\r\nexecuting his mission by an expressive sign. In front of her, but\r\non a lower level, so as to appear of less majestic presence, stand\r\nthe Precursor and St. Sebastian; the former points to the principal\r\ngroup as the fulfilment of a cycle of prophecy which in his person\r\nwas complete; the latter is a graceful prototype of that long series\r\nof martyrs who were destined to seal with blood their testimony to\r\nthe atonement thus initiated. One portion of this novel theme had\r\nbeen anticipated by Giovanni Sanzi, in whose representation of the\r\nsame subject at the Brera, though composed after old conventional\r\nideas, the divine Infant is seen descending from the Almighty upon\r\nthe Virgin, instead of the dove, which usually figures as the Holy\r\nSpirit. But such innovations were looked upon with watchful jealousy\r\nby a Church wedded to traditional conventionalities. Doubts were\r\nraised as to the orthodoxy of this representation of the Trinity,\r\nand an unfortunate ruddy tint suffused over the plumage of the snowy\r\ndove was construed into a stain on the immaculate character of the\r\nconception, which is usually represented as coincident with the\r\nAnnunciation. The altar-piece was removed to undergo along with its\r\nauthor a searching examination, which resulted in its restoration as\r\nan object of devotion, and in his escape from the rigours of the Holy\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nTwo altar-pictures by Timoteo remain in the cathedral-sacristy of\r\nhis native city,[*194] besides a St. Apollonia in the church of\r\nthe Trinità. These exhibit much soft expression and devotional\r\nfeeling, combined with considerable breadth of execution; yet\r\nthey scarcely possess the simple sentiment of the earlier Umbrian\r\nartificers, the noble character of Sanzi, or the fervour and finish\r\nof Francia. During his residence at Urbino, he may not improbably\r\nhave influenced the young Raffaele's opening genius; but, ere long,\r\nfame's many-tongued trumpet told him how much he had to learn of his\r\ncountryman, from whom he soon received an invitation to assist in\r\nexecuting the commissions which were crowding upon him at Rome; and,\r\nlike many other gifted artists, Timoteo deemed it no degradation to\r\nwork under his younger but more matured genius. Although one of the\r\nlatest painters who retained that devotional spirit which we have\r\nendeavoured to trace from the Umbrian sanctuaries, his manner, at an\r\nafter period of his life, changed with the influences to which he was\r\nexposed in the atmosphere of the Vatican; and some of those works\r\nproduced under the superintendence of Raffaele which are generally\r\nascribed to his hand, such as the Sybils in the S. Maria della\r\nPace,[*195] display a very decided tendency to \"the new manner.\"\r\nFew paintings have given occasion to greater variety of opinion\r\nand conjecture than this fresco, both as to the share in it which\r\nbelongs to Timoteo, and as to the source from which the conception\r\nwas derived. The theme is unquestionably referable to an authority\r\nolder than that of Michael Angelo; and it is remarkable that, instead\r\nof the charge of plagiarism from his great rival being brought home\r\nto Raffaele, as has been frequently asserted, the former must have\r\nowed to Perugino, Pinturicchio, and Andrea d'Assisi the idea of\r\nrendering the sybils of mythological fable subservient to religious\r\nrepresentation.[*196] By all these artists, pagan pythonesses\r\nhad been grouped with scriptural prophets, as foreshadowing the\r\nmysterious plan of human salvation, and the fresco of the Pace must\r\nbe regarded as a felicitous adaptation of Umbrian feeling to the\r\ntastes of such a patron as Agostino Chigi, deeply imbued with the\r\nclassic tendencies of the Roman court.[197] The repeated restorations\r\nto which this fine work has been subjected render criticism of its\r\nmerits in a degree nugatory, but the inferiority of the Prophets to\r\nthe Sibyls is generally admitted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *194: In the Cathedral sacristy is the St. Martin and St.\r\nThomas of 1504, with the founders beside them. In the Pinacoteca\r\nthere is a half figure of S. Sebastian, the figures of S. Roch and of\r\nTobias with the Angel. The S. Apollonia, once in S. Trinità is now in\r\nthe Gallery. Of these, the S. Sebastian, S. Roch, and Tobias show the\r\ninfluence of Giovanni Santi, the other two the influence of Raphael.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *195: Timoteo painted the Prophets above the Sibyls in S.\r\nMaria della Pace, in Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *196: The Sibyl was not exclusively Pagan. Consider the\r\nfirst verse of the _Dies Irae_, which ends--\r\n\r\n     \"Teste David cum Sibylla.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: See the learned observations of PUNGILEONE,\r\nin the _Elogio Storico di Timoteo Vite_, pp. 23-38.]\r\n\r\nVasari, after communication with our painter's family, represents\r\nhim as pining for his native air in the capital of Christendom,\r\nwhere his stay cannot have been of very long duration, as we find\r\nhim in 1513 one of the magistracy of Urbino. Here he shared his time\r\nbetween the sister arts of poetry, music, and painting, \"delighting\r\nto play upon various instruments, but especially the lyre, to which\r\nhe sang improviso with uncommon success.\" On Vasari's authority,\r\nwe are also told that he \"was a cheerful person, naturally gay and\r\njovial, handsome, facetious in conversation, and happy in his jokes.\"\r\nOne of the most remarkable productions of his Raffaelesque period\r\nis a _Noli me tangere_ (the appearance of Christ to the Magdalen\r\nafter his resurrection), in the chapel of the Artieri, at Cagli,\r\nexecuted about 1518, which has been, perhaps, over-praised by Lanzi\r\nand others: the difficulty of the subject may in some degree disarm\r\nour criticism of its rather crowded and ungainly composition. On\r\nthe whole, the merit and beauty of the few known productions of\r\nhis pencil may well make us regret those which have disappeared,\r\nor which pass under other names; and, although Passavant accuses\r\nhim of affectation and mannerism, the constraint apparent in some\r\nof his earlier productions may possibly be more justly ascribed to\r\nawkwardness. Pungileone supposes him to have returned to Rome in\r\n1521, two years before his death, and there to have acquired a number\r\nof the cartoons and drawings of his friend Raffaele. Of these, and\r\nhis own designs, a considerable portion passed a few years ago into\r\nthe Lawrence collection, which the vacillation and ill-timed economy\r\nof our rulers allowed to be in a great measure dispersed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew artists have been the subject of more controversy than\r\nBRAMANTE. His architectural works procured him high reputation, for he\r\nis associated with the genius of Julius II., and the vast piles of\r\nthe Vatican: but his name and family have been disputed, as well as\r\nthe place and province which gave him birth; while his biographers,\r\nbesides confounding him with an entirely different person, Bramantino\r\nof Milan, have aggravated the confusion by conjuring out of these\r\ntwo a third artist, who exists only by their blundering. Bartolomeo\r\nSuardi, instead of being master of Bramante, as Orlandi and others\r\nhave supposed, was a pupil who, from attachment to his instructor,\r\nadded to his own name the diminutive Bramantino. He chanced, however,\r\nto have a scholar, Agostino, who, by also adopting that designation,\r\nhas further perplexed matters; three persons being thus almost\r\ninextricably mixed up. For our purpose it is enough thus to supply\r\na key to these masters, and to observe that their relative merits\r\ncoincide with their chronology; the first being a bright light of\r\nthe golden age, the last an obscure painter of the _decadence_, who\r\nhas left us little beyond the reflected lustre of a borrowed surname.\r\nBut although the minute diligence of Lazzari and Pungileone seems to\r\nhave set this matter at rest, their tedious disquisitions supply few\r\nimportant facts or useful criticisms, and a brief notice will suffice\r\nfor our present purpose.\r\n\r\nDonato Bramante appears to have been born at Monte Asdrualdo, near\r\nFermignano, in 1444, of parents in comfortable circumstances. As\r\nhis first efforts were devoted to painting, he would naturally find\r\ninstructors among the Umbrian artists already noticed; but for\r\nhis education we have no particulars, beyond a conjecture that he\r\nstudied under Fra Carnevale.[*198] At his father's death, in 1484,\r\nhe was already abroad, probably in Lombardy, where most of his\r\npictorial works were produced, and where some frescoes may still be\r\nseen, meriting no ordinary meed of approbation, and particularly\r\ndistinguished by fidelity in portraits and accuracy of architectural\r\nperspective; qualities learned, doubtless, from the productions of\r\nMelozzo da Forlì and Piero della Francesca. Of these mural paintings,\r\nthe most interesting remains in the church of the Canepa, at Pavia,\r\nand exhibits the artist presenting a model for that building to its\r\nfounder, Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza, his Duchess, and his mother.\r\nRosini ascribes to him freedom of design, ease in movement and\r\ndraperies, grand conceptions, and much ability in perspective.\r\nIndeed, whilst the colder genius of ultramontane nations has seldom\r\noccupied itself with more than one branch of art, many Italian\r\nmasters attained to excellence in several; and Bramante's reputation\r\nas an architect being established, his engineering talents were\r\ncalled into exercise by Ludovico il Moro, upon the fortifications\r\nof Milan. There too he built several churches, and constructed as\r\na sacristy for S. Satiro, one of those small round Grecian fanes\r\nwhich have been considered so peculiarly his own, that various\r\nchurches of that type are ascribed to him on no better grounds than\r\ntheir form. The conception is, however, of earlier origin, for it\r\nappears in not a few miniatures and small devotional panels of the\r\npreceding century. He had adopted it in a little chapel of the\r\nMadonna di Riscatto, on the banks of the Metauro, opposite Castel\r\nDurante, said to have been his earliest work, and the idea was freely\r\nused by Perugino and his pupils, Raffaele included. It takes the\r\nform of a round building cased by Corinthian pilasters, in an easel\r\npicture preserved at Urbino, in the sacristy of Sta. Chiara, which\r\nis interesting as an architectural study, and has been attributed to\r\nBramante, or to Giorgio Andreoli, the porcelain enameller of Gubbio.\r\nA symmetrically elegant Doric chapel, at S. Pietro in Montorio\r\nat Rome, is the chef-d'oeuvre of this classic style, and it was\r\nreproduced by della Genga in scenic decorations prepared at Urbino\r\nfor the representation of Bibbiena's _Calandra_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *198: He was probably the pupil of Luciano da Laurana and\r\nPiero della Francesca.]\r\n\r\nAs the flower of Bramante's life went by during his long stay\r\nin Upper Italy, it is there that his pictorial talents must be\r\nappreciated, and that his most numerous, if not his most famous\r\nfabrics, may be found. But when Lombardy became the battle-field\r\nof Italian independence, when art was there neglected and personal\r\nsafety compromised, he bethought him of the monuments of antique\r\ngenius still scattered over the capital of her classic times, and\r\ncame to Rome in quest of improvement as well as employment. The\r\nmoment was not propitious, for Alexander VI. was no Maecenas. Yet in\r\nthe public works, both of fresco-painting and architecture, Donato\r\nhad a share; and he supplied designs for several private churches\r\nand palaces, varying the scene of his labours by prolonged visits to\r\nNaples and Tivoli.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Julius II. his star rapidly rose to the zenith\r\nof his reputation. His Urbino extraction was a recommendation to\r\nthe new Pontiff, which his talents fully justified, while the vast\r\nconceptions and daring energy of his Holiness found in Bramante a\r\nwilling and apt minister. To raise a temple wherein the Christian\r\nworld might worship the living God, was a project worthy of their\r\nunited genius, and it was entertained in a manner befitting the\r\nenterprise. There, grandeur of design was seconded by resolute\r\npurpose; nor were means and will deficient for levying from the piety\r\nor fears of mankind contributions apparently inexhaustible. But in\r\na struggle with time, man is seldom victorious. The shadows of age,\r\nfalling upon the Pontiff and his architect, warned them that their\r\nday was far spent. Anticipating the night that approached to arrest\r\ntheir labours, they worked with a zeal which knew no repose, but\r\nwhich proved fatal to the stability of their fabric. Death overtook\r\nthem both ere any part of St. Peter's approached to completion, yet\r\nnot before the too hurried masonry had begun to yield under its own\r\nweight. The inadequate foundations occasioned much supplementary\r\ntrouble and outlay to those who conducted the edifice towards a\r\nconclusion, which it did not reach until 1626, a hundred and twenty\r\nyears after it had been begun by Bramante.\r\n\r\nBy some who witnessed the rapid and indiscriminate destruction\r\nof old St. Peter's,--that ancient basilicon, which early art had\r\ndone its best to decorate, which Christian devotion had sanctified\r\nby cherished traditions, and over which time had cast a solemn\r\nhalo,--Bramante has been blamed as a reckless innovator; and the\r\ncharge meets a ready response from those who, in their search for\r\nprimeval monuments of Catholic faith, pass from the glare and\r\nmagnificence of the modern fane to mourn over broken sculptures and\r\nshattered mosaics buried in its rayless crypt. It would be easy to\r\ndefend the architect at the expense of his master; but upon looking\r\nmore closely into the charge, we shall find that the original fabric\r\nhaving become ruinous, its reconstruction was begun half a century\r\nbefore the accession of Julius, and that its last remains were\r\nnot removed until a hundred years later. Thus it would seem that\r\nthe demolition of so much that is ill replaced to the churchman\r\nand scholar of art, even by the gorgeous temple which commands\r\nour wondering admiration, must have proceeded from other reasons\r\nthan haste. The slippery foundations that from time to time have\r\noccasioned infinite anxiety and expense, both for the church and\r\nadjoining buildings, were doubtless the original cause which lost us\r\nthe basilicon of Constantine.\r\n\r\nBut Julius was not the man to devote himself exclusively to one idea,\r\neven though a favourite one. Wishing to provide a palace for his\r\nsuccessors worthy of the neighbouring fane which he had founded, he\r\nput the Vatican into Donato's hands. That pontifical residence, after\r\nbeing enlarged by Nicolas V. and Sixtus IV. was in a great measure\r\nreconstructed by Alexander VI., whose predecessor, Innocent VIII.,\r\nhad erected a casino in the adjoining gardens of the Belvidere.\r\nIn order to unite this casino to the palace, Bramante contrived a\r\ndouble corridor, the vast intervening area of which he designed for\r\nfestive spectacles. This fine idea, left by him unfinished, was\r\nmarred by succeeding architects, who broke up the extensive court by\r\ncross galleries and unseemly appendages. We may, however, pardon the\r\ntransmutation, as it has afforded admirable accommodation for the\r\ntreasures of art, ever since accumulating in these almost boundless\r\nmuseums. In that handsome street to which Julius bequeathed his name,\r\nthere may be seen near the church of S. Biagio, straggling vestiges\r\nof vast substructions, with rustic basements resembling the gigantic\r\nmasses of fabulous ages, on which have been reared some mean and\r\nmodern dwellings. These are the sole remains of a vast undertaking,\r\nnobly conceived by the Pontiff, and ably commenced by his architect,\r\nin order to unite under one palace the scattered law-courts and\r\npublic offices of Rome. But it was Bramante's misfortune to serve a\r\nrestless spirit, which attempting more than the span of human life\r\ncould overtake, left its finest conceptions abortive.\r\n\r\nThe merits of Bramante were appreciated by his contemporaries as well\r\nas by posterity, and gained him a substantial meed of honour and\r\nwealth. At the pontifical court he moved in a circle where refinement\r\nperfected the emanations of genius, and which included the choicest\r\nspirits of a brilliant age. Enriched by papal favour, magnificent in\r\nhis expenditure, frank and joyous in his nature, he lived up to the\r\nadvantages of his position, and made his palace the resort of many\r\ncelebrities: there his Umbrian countrymen, Perugino, Pinturicchio,\r\nand Luca Signorelli, frequented his board; and after his death the\r\nhouse was bought by his friend Raffaele. He was a poet, for in Italy\r\nall sentiment readily falls into rhyme; but he was likewise a man\r\nof the world, whose natural tact and ready fluency compensated for\r\na defective education. Dying in March, 1514, he was buried beneath\r\nthat splendid fane which he had founded, but which many successive\r\narchitects failed to raise. No monument testifies the gratitude of\r\nhis countrymen, yet his name is entwined with garlands of undying\r\nverdure, and some of the noblest Italian piles bear the impress of\r\nhis solid and enduring style.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRA BERNARDO CATELANI was a Capuchin monk of Urbino, whose\r\ndevotion sought scope in the exercise of Christian art, and who is\r\ngenerally considered a follower of Raffaele, although this is doubted\r\nby Grossi. Nor does it much matter, for the only work now identified\r\nwith his name is an altar-piece of the Pietà with two attendant\r\nsaints, in the church of his order at Cagli. Still less is known\r\nof one CROCCHIA of Urbino, named by Baldinucci as a pupil\r\nof Raffaele. His countryman, Centogatti, is said to have exercised\r\nthe arts of architecture, sculpture, and painting, and to have\r\ninstructed Duke Francesco Maria I., and also Gian Battista Comandino,\r\nin engineering. To him Lomazzo ascribes the invention of _baluardi_,\r\nand the erection of walls round his native town; but in both respects\r\nhe appears mistaken, as we have had occasion to show in speaking of\r\nFrancesco di Giorgio.[199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: See p. 214 above. In an old MS. chronicle I\r\nfind, besides most of the names here enumerated, the following\r\nnow-forgotten painters of Urbino, at the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury:--Bartolomeo di Maestro Gentile, Bernardino di Pierantonio,\r\nRicci Manara, Francesco di Mercatello, and in 1528 Ottaviano della\r\nPrassede.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe patronage extended to Francia by Duke Guidobaldo seems, from\r\nVasari's authority, to have been of a very undiscriminating\r\ncharacter, for his commissions to that painter of sweet Madonnas\r\nconsisted of a Lucrezia, and a set of horse-trappings, whereon was\r\ndepicted a blazing forest, with various animals escaping from it.\r\nGaye has recovered some facts as to the favour bestowed by this\r\ndynasty upon Andrea Mantegna. In 1511, Duchess Elisabetta wrote\r\nto interest her brother, the Marquis of Mantua, in favour of his\r\nson Francesco, expressing herself as mindful of the regard she had\r\nborne his father, on account both of his own merits and his devotion\r\nto her family. Andrea's acquaintance with Giovanni Sanzi, already\r\nreferred to, may have been formed on his journey to Rome in 1488,\r\nor on his return thence in 1490; but his fame had ere then reached\r\nUmbria, for in 1484 Ludovico Gonzaga, bishop of Mantua, wrote to the\r\nPrefect della Rovere, pleading his excuse for declining an order for\r\na Madonna, his time being engrossed in the palace of Mantua. Vasari\r\nfurther tells us that Marco Zoppo, another Lombard painter, took a\r\nportrait of Guidobaldo when in the Florentine service. To his reign\r\nprobably belongs a very grand specimen of Giovanni Bellini in the\r\nchurch of S. Francesco at Pesaro. We have already noticed him as a\r\npupil of Gentile di Fabriano; and his visit to the duchy may have\r\nenabled him to confirm his early devotional impressions, by there\r\ndepicting that favourite theme of the mystic school, the Coronation\r\nof the Madonna, surrounded by witnessing saints. The countenances,\r\nthough without the unearthly inspiration belonging to the Umbrian\r\nart, have great beauty softened by reverential sentiment, and a\r\ncolour which glows even through the dirt of centuries. In the Sta.\r\nMaria Nuova of Fano are preserved two of Perugino's finest works,\r\nthe Annunciation, and the Madonna enthroned between six saints,\r\nexhibiting all the qualities of his best time, with less timidity\r\nthan belongs to his manner. The latter was executed in 1490, and\r\nthe predella had been considered equal to Raffaele, who of course\r\nwas then too young for such an undertaking. Such are some of the\r\nremaining pictures which must have influenced taste and art in\r\nthe duchy. The catalogue is far from complete, for in the obscure\r\nvillages may still be discovered altar-panels of scarcely inferior\r\nimportance, besides not a few transported thence to Milan, Berlin,\r\nand other galleries.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Lord Lindsay some very interesting views on the influence\r\nof early Teutonic art beyond the Alps, a subject long overlooked\r\nand still far from exhausted.[200] Among its masters no celebrity\r\nequals that of Jean Van Eyck. He was not only _capo-scuola_ in the\r\nLow Countries and inventor of a new method and vehicle of painting,\r\nbut was the first to introduce that \"feeling for nature and domestic\r\nsentiment\" which, subordinate at the outset to religious delineation,\r\nhas continued, through many phases, and for the most part with\r\nstrictly naturalist aims, to characterise the Flemish pencil. The\r\nfame of his mechanism spread into Italy, and Vasari speaks of a\r\nbath scene being sent by him to Duke Federigo of Urbino. This was,\r\nhowever, probably the same work described as belonging to Cardinal\r\nOttaviani by Facio, who wrote about 1456. In a room lighted by a\r\nsingle lamp, a group of nude females issued from the bath, an aged\r\nbeldame, their attendant, bathed in perspiration, their thirsty dog\r\nlapping water. A mirror accurately gave back the scene, reflecting\r\nthe profile of the one whose figure was turned from the spectator.\r\nWithout, was elaborate and far-spreading scenery, with men, horses,\r\ncastles, hamlets, groves, plains, and mountains, dexterously\r\ngraduating away as the evening shadows fell. Keeping in view the\r\nstate of art at that time, this painting, of which all further trace\r\nmysteriously vanishes, must have exercised an important influence.\r\nThe borrowed illumination, the mirror reflections, the nude forms,\r\nthe heated atmosphere detected by its physical effects on animal\r\nlife, the minutely pencilled landscape, the delicately receding\r\nperspective, were all more or less innovations in Italy, apart from\r\nthe colour and surface produced by the new process.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Sketches of the History of Christian Art_, Letter\r\nVIII., especially part II., §§ 1, 2, 4, and part III., § 6.]\r\n\r\nAmong the followers of Van Eyck who first made their way to the\r\nMediterranean shores was JOSSE or JUSTUS OF GHENT, who, under the\r\nsignature of Justus de Alemania, appears to have executed an\r\nAnnunciation in fresco, at the convent of Sta. Maria di Castello\r\nat Genoa in 1451.[*201] Admiration for Van Eyck's bath scene may\r\nprobably have obtained for him an invitation to Urbino, where,\r\nhowever, he does not seem to have shared the ducal patronage, but\r\nwas employed by the fraternity of Corpus Christi to paint for them\r\nan altar-piece, which, after nine years of labour, was completed in\r\n1474, and is still preserved in the church of Sta. Agata.[*202] It\r\nwas executed in oil, about ten feet square without the now missing\r\npredella, and seems to have cost 500 florins, besides materials.\r\nIts subject was appropriately the Institution of the Eucharist, in\r\ncontradistinction from the Last Supper, and it is treated after\r\nthe manner of the Romish mass,--Christ distributes the sacramental\r\nwafer to his Apostles kneeling round a table, over whom hover two\r\nwhite-draped angels of the Van Eyck type. Four personages stand\r\napart, spectators of the sacred mystery, and these, by the legitimate\r\nrules of sacred art, might be portraits. Among them may be easily\r\nrecognised the Duke; and a turbaned figure is said by Baldi to be the\r\nambassador from Usum-cassan, King of Persia, while visiting the court\r\nin 1470-1, on a mission to unite the Italian princes in a league\r\nagainst the Turk,--a fact garbled by Michiels, whose commendations\r\nof the picture are greater than its distance above the eye allows me\r\nto confirm or challenge, as, without scaffolding or a very strong\r\nglass, all detailed criticism must be in a great measure conjectural.\r\nNeither have I discovered that influence upon art at Urbino which he\r\nand Passavant impute to this Fleming, whose only other known work in\r\nUmbria was a now lost church standard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *201: But Justus de Alemania, who painted at Genoa, and\r\nJustus of Ghent, are different persons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *202: Now in the Pinacoteca.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArt has in many instances been able largely to compensate the\r\nliberality of its early patrons. Besides preserving to after times\r\nthe person of those\r\n\r\n     \"Whose barks have left no traces on the tide,\"\r\n\r\nit has frequently transmitted to us the form and comeliness of\r\nmen whose characters, actions, or talents have left an impress\r\non their age. Although the pencil and the chisel were at first\r\nrarely dedicated to portraiture, a mode of representation arose in\r\nItaly during the fifteenth century which supplied this want with\r\nsingular success. Reviving classical taste found few more attractive\r\nrelics than the coins and medals of Greece and her colonies; but\r\ntheir imitators, struck with the inferiority of those under the\r\nRoman empire, adopted, and even surpassed, the bold style and\r\nhigh relief of the former. When almost every principality in the\r\nPeninsula possessed a mint, and die-cutting was a usual branch of\r\nthe goldsmith's craft, there were great facilities for the new\r\nart. The circulation of precious metals being very limited, trade\r\nwas then conducted chiefly by barter, or by the transmission of\r\ncoin in sealed bags, stamped with the value they contained, whilst\r\nsmall transactions were made almost solely in copper money.[203]\r\nHeroic medals, which soon became the established meed of egotism\r\nand incense of flattery, were at first cast,--and, when machinery\r\nbecame more perfect, were struck,--in an alloy of copper, under the\r\nname of bronze. Those of the fifteenth century were of great size,\r\nvarying from one to four and a half inches in diameter; many bear\r\nthe names of well-known sculptors and painters as their artists,\r\nand exhibit a grandeur of conception unequalled in other numismatic\r\nproductions.[*204] About three hundred and seventy-five such medals\r\nhave been published in the Trésor de Numismatique et de Glyptique,\r\nand although the _procédé Collas_ there adopted in general fails\r\nto preserve the sharpness and finish given to the originals by\r\ncareful retouching, no work of art is so delightful a companion\r\nto Italian mediæval history. Zannetti's elaborate collections on\r\nItalian coinages, and the fifth volume of Cicognara's great work upon\r\nsculpture, may also be consulted with pleasure and advantage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: The coinage of Duke Federigo consisted of Bolognini\r\nand Piccioli. The former were small thin silver pieces, weighing\r\n19-1/2 grains, of which 3-1/2 were copper alloy, and forty of them\r\nmade a florin. The florin, a nominal coin, thus contained 634-34/59\r\ngrains of pure silver, and 146-1/2 grains of copper; and supposing\r\npure silver worth, as now, 5s. 6d. an ounce, it would be worth 7s.\r\n3-1/4d. sterling, making a bolognini 7-1/3 farthings. The piccioli\r\n(3-3/5 to a farthing) were about the size of bolognini (52 or 56 to\r\nthe ounce); but were of copper alloyed with about three per cent. of\r\nsilver. All this Duke's coinage seems to have been minted at Gubbio,\r\nand it is described at great length by Reposati, in his _Zecca di\r\nGubbio_. See p. 41 above, and Author's Preface.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *204: See on this subject the most excellent book by\r\nG.F. HILL, _Pisanello_ (London, 1905); a good bibliography\r\nis there given.]\r\n\r\nThe only medallist of Urbino now known was called Clemente, and,\r\nbesides the portrait by him to be immediately noticed (No. I.), he is\r\nsaid to have ornamented the great hall of the palace with six round\r\nbas-reliefs of Duke Federigo's exploits. Seven medals of that prince\r\nhave come to my knowledge, all of extreme rarity: the first five are\r\ndescribed and engraved in the _Zecca di Gubbio_; the first, second,\r\nand fourth in the Trésor de Numismatique; the sixth is probably\r\nunnoticed elsewhere. The heads of all are in profile.\r\n\r\nNo. I. A medallion of 3-5/8 inches diameter. The Duke's bust is in\r\narmour, on which are chased a Lapitha reducing a Centaur, and other\r\nemblematic devices; his cap, called by the French a _mortier_, is\r\nof the usual cinque-cento form, exactly resembling a round Highland\r\nbonnet. The legend is a Latin couplet, signifying,\r\n\r\n     \"HE COMES, ANOTHER CÆSAR AND ANOTHER ROMAN SCIPIO,\r\n     WHETHER HE GIVES TO THE NATIONS PEACE OR FIERCE WARS.\"\r\n\r\nThe reverse is redundant in allegory. In base, the eagle of Jove\r\nsupports with extended wings a stage whereon are three devices,--the\r\nglobe of command, with on one side a cuirass, buckler, and sword,\r\nand on the other a clothes-brush[205] and olive-branch; overhead are\r\nthe planetary signs of Jupiter between Mars and Venus. On the vacant\r\nspaces are the names of the hero, \"FEDERIGO THE INVINCIBLE, COUNT\r\nOF URBINO, A.D. MCCCCLXVIII.,\" and of the artist, \"THE WORK\r\nOF CLEMENTE OF URBINO.\" The surrounding astrological legend runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n     \"THE FIERCE MARS AND VENUS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MIGHTY THUNDERER,\r\n     UNITE TO GIVE YOU KINGDOMS, AND INFLUENCE YOUR DESTINY.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Riposati mistakes this for a metal weight. The French\r\nwork does not venture on any conjecture as to the object represented.]\r\n\r\nThe date indicates this medal to have commemorated his campaign\r\nin Romagna against Colleone, in 1467, and notwithstanding the\r\nquestionable taste of crowding in so many symbolical appendages, its\r\nmerit is ranked high by Cicognara (see his eighty-sixth plate).\r\n\r\nNo. II. A medal 1-6/8 inches across, which was probably cast at\r\nNaples in 1474, by order of Ferdinand, in honour of Federigo's visit\r\nand installation as a knight of the Ermine. Being no doubt prepared\r\nbefore his arrival, the likeness is not striking. Round the bust is\r\n\"FEDERICO COUNT OF MONTEFELTRO, URBINO, AND DURANTE\"; on the\r\nreverse, over a collared ermine, \"ROYAL CAPTAIN-GENERAL. THE WORK\r\nOF PAULO DI RAGUSA.\"\r\n\r\nNo. III. A similar but smaller medal, executed after he had been\r\nelevated to the dukedom. His head is bald, and the legend is\r\n\"FEDERIGO THE MONTEFELTRIAN, URBINO'S DUKE;\" over the ermine, \"NEVER,\"\r\nthe motto of the Order.\r\n\r\nNo. IV. A medal 3-3/8 inches across, commemorating his dignities\r\nof Duke and Gonfaloniere of the Church. Round his bust in armour,\r\nwith the mortier cap, we read, \"OF THE DIVINE FEDERIGO DUKE OF\r\nURBINO, COUNT OF MONTEFELTRO AND DURANTE, ROYAL CAPTAIN-GENERAL,\r\nAND UNCONQUERED GONFALONIERE OF THE HOLY ROMAN CHURCH.\" On the\r\nreverse he is represented in a cuirass, mail-coat, jack-boots, and\r\nthe mortier cap, mounted on a heavy war-horse in housings of mail.\r\nHe moves forward, stretching forth his truncheon in the attitude of\r\nanxious command, a two-handed sword on his side. Legend, \"THE\r\nWORK OF SPERANDEI,\" who was a native of Mantua, greatly\r\npatronised by the sovereigns of Ferrara.\r\n\r\nNo. V. is a magnificent production, and of peculiarly English\r\ninterest. On a medal 4-3/4 inches across, clasped round by the badge\r\nand gothic motto of the Garter, is a noble bust of Federigo in\r\narmour, his massive bald head uncovered. The reverse has five winged\r\nloves supporting an ample basin, from whence issue two grape-laden\r\ncornucopiæ; between them the crowned eagle of Montefeltro sits on\r\na globe of command, gazing sunward, and supporting the armorial\r\nshield of that house, with the papal arms in pale as borne by the\r\nGonfaloniere: the contracted inscription \"DUKE FE.\" appears\r\non the ground. Riposati conjectures that in this device may be\r\npreserved the design of a fountain for serving wine to the populace\r\nduring the festivities on his investiture with the English order;\r\nat all events, this piece, in size and style, perhaps the grandest\r\nmedallion of the age, bears interesting testimony to the honour in\r\nwhich that decoration was held.\r\n\r\nNo. VI. Among the Vatican Urbino MSS. (No. 1418) is a case containing\r\ntwo impressions, stamped on leather, of another medallion, which we\r\nhave nowhere else met with. It is 3-1/2 inches in diameter, and round\r\nthe head is \"FEDERIGO DUKE OF URBINO, COUNT OF MONTEFELTRO, ROYAL\r\nCAPTAIN-GENERAL AND GONFALONIERE OF THE HOLY ROMAN CHURCH.\"\r\nThe reverse gives us a mounted knight cap-a-pie, who tramples down\r\nan armed soldier, while charging others who fly; in the distance\r\nare seen cities, and a martial host. Legend, \"MARS GIVES HIM A\r\nWORSTED FOE, VICTORY SECURES HIM FAME. MCCCCLXXVIII. THE WORK OF GIAN\r\nFRANCESCO, OF PARMA.\" This alludes to his successes against the\r\nFlorentines when general of Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\nNo. VII. A medal of Federigo by Francesco di Giorgio, has neither\r\nbeen described nor preserved, unless it may have been No. V. above.\r\n\r\nWe have no medal of Duke Guidobaldo I.; but two have come down to us,\r\nrepresenting his consort and her favourite Emilia Pia, so similar in\r\ncharacter as to indicate probably the same artist and period, which\r\nRiposati presumes to have been in the Duchess's widowhood.\r\n\r\nI. Elisabetta's bust on a medallion 3-1/2 inches in diameter; her\r\nhair braided under her cap, and gathered behind into a long pendant\r\ntail or fillet plaited with ribbon; her forehead, neck, and\r\nshoulders ornamented with chains; legend, \"ELISABET GONZAGA, THE\r\nFELTRIAN, DUCHESS OF URBINO\": which we give. The mystic science\r\nof emblematic devices was often used by medallists without proper\r\ndiscrimination; and Riposati avows himself unable to interpret its\r\nallegorical reverse: the French editor describes it as a nearly nude\r\nfemale reclining on the ground, her head supported against a wicket,\r\ngrasping in both hands a fillet from which a wig flies away, with the\r\nmotto, \"THIS TELL TO FUGITIVE FORTUNE\"; he interprets her\r\nattitude as contemptuous towards a passing opportunity, in allusion\r\nto her recent widowhood spurning fresh ties.\r\n\r\nII. The medal of Emilia was evidently a posthumous memorial; we\r\nreproduce it also. It is 3-1/4 inches broad, the bust in the costume\r\nof the Duchess, and is inscribed \"EMILIA PIA THE FELTRIAN\":\r\non the reverse, a tapered pyramid crowned by a cinerary urn, with\r\n\"TO HER CHASTE ASHES.\" The whole is studiously classical,\r\nand pagan in feeling. Her name Pio, turned into the adjective _pia_,\r\nbecomes a complimentary epithet.\r\n\r\nIn order to dismiss this branch of our subject, we may here mention,\r\nthat, although a few smaller medals were struck for the second\r\ndynasty of Urbino, none of them are worthy of special notice; indeed,\r\nthis art was entirely degenerate after 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH\r\n\r\nOF THE DELLA ROVERE FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n     Birth and elevation of Sixtus IV.--Genealogy of the\r\n     Della Rovere family--Nepotism of that pontiff--His\r\n     improvements in Rome--His patronage of letters and\r\n     arts--His brother Giovanni becomes Lord of Sinigaglia\r\n     and Prefect of Rome--His beneficent sway--He pillages a\r\n     papal envoy--Remarkable story of Zizim or Gem--Portrait of\r\n     Giovanni--The early character and difficulties of Julius\r\n     II.--Estimate of his pontificate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of July, 1414, in the village of Celle, upon the Ligurian\r\ncoast, near Savona, there was born to Leonardo della Rovere and\r\nLuchina Muglione, a male child, who, fifty-seven years thereafter,\r\nwas called to fill the chair of St. Peter, from whence he showered\r\nupon his numerous relations temporal and ecclesiastical dignities.\r\nThat Pontiff was Sixtus IV.; of these relatives many have already\r\nfound a place in our pages; and from their stock sprang the second\r\nducal dynasty of Urbino.\r\n\r\nUpon the origin of this family a mystery has been thrown, by writers\r\ndevoted to adulation rather than to truth. There was established\r\nnear Turin a race of della Rovere, lords of Vinovo, whose nobility\r\nis traced from the eighth century, and from whom it was the pride of\r\nSixtus to claim a descent, which his flatterers readily humoured,\r\nand which the annalists of Urbino adopted as an article of their\r\npolitical creed. Posterity has repudiated the allegation, for \"in\r\nItaly, at least, it is vain for heraldry to tell a tale that history\r\nwill not substantiate.\"[206] The seigneurs of Vinovo were not,\r\nhowever, loath to admit a blood connection with two Popes, who, in\r\nreturn for such aggregation to the old stock, conferred cardinals'\r\nhats upon their cousins of Piedmont. Although the tombstone of\r\nLeonardo was said to exhibit the Vinovo bearings, with a suitable\r\ndifference, his humble birth is universally admitted. The burgess\r\nof Savona plied a fisher's trade, and even his son is supposed to\r\nhave followed in boyhood the same apostolical calling; an occupation\r\nsingular rather than inappropriate, for one destined to wear \"the\r\nfisher's ring,\" and to wield the authority of him who was divinely\r\ncalled to be a netter of men. The superstition or policy of Sixtus\r\nstamped with unmerited importance certain quasi-supernatural\r\nincidents attending his birth. Whilst pregnant, his mother dreamt\r\nthat a boy was born to her, whom two Franciscan friars forthwith clad\r\nin the tunic, cowl, and cord of their order. The name Francesco was\r\naccordingly bestowed on the child, whose gestures seemed to confirm\r\nits sacred vocation, the first motions of its little hands being\r\nthose of benediction. Whilst undergoing the usual ablutions, the\r\ninfant appeared faint and dying, whereupon its mother vowed that, if\r\npreserved to her, it should wear the Franciscan dress for the next\r\nsix months. The removal of this habit having on two occasions been\r\nfollowed by dangerous illness, the boy's destination to a monastic\r\nlife was confirmed, and his training conducted accordingly.[*207]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: MARIOTTI'S _Italy_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *207: For birth of Sixtus IV., cf. CREIGHTON, _op.\r\ncit._, vol. IV., p. 65, and authorities there quoted. \"His father was\r\na poor peasant in a little village near Savona, and at the age of\r\nnine Francesco was handed over to the Franciscans to be educated. He\r\nacted for a time as tutor with the family of Rovere, in Piedmont, and\r\nfrom them he took the name by which he was afterwards known.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter rapid progress in classical and dialectic studies, he went\r\nto the university of Bologna, and in his twentieth year maintained\r\nvarious public disputations before a general chapter of his order\r\nat Genoa, with erudition and success which astonished his audience,\r\nand gained him the marked commendation of his superiors. He then\r\ngraduated in philosophy and theology at Pavia, and in his public\r\ndisplays distinguished himself by a simple and perspicuous style\r\nof argument comparatively exempt from the jingle of words that\r\nusually characterised these exercises. His celebrity extending in\r\nall directions, he was engaged by the authorities of many large\r\ntowns to deliver lectures, which were attended by the most learned\r\necclesiastics, his preaching being not less acceptable to the\r\npeople of all ranks. His friendship and counsel were sought by the\r\ndistinguished men of his time, including Cardinal Bessarion; and\r\nhe employed his pen in various religious controversies, especially\r\nin one, carried by other disputants to blows, between two branches\r\nof Franciscans, the Minims and Predicant Friars, as to \"whether\r\nthe blood of Christ shed in his passion partook of his divinity.\"\r\nHaving attained the rank of General, he proved most zealous in\r\nthe inspection and reform of the convents under his jurisdiction,\r\npersonally visiting them in all quarters. At length, in 1467, he was\r\nmade Cardinal by Paul II., whom he was chosen to succeed on the 9th\r\nof August, 1471.\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion, in a previous portion of this work, to notice\r\nthe policy of Sixtus as it affected the duchy of Urbino, and it\r\nforms no part of our plan to enter further into the events of his\r\npontificate. Neither need we detail those in that of his nephew\r\nJulius II., except in so far as they fall to be narrated in our\r\nThird and Sixth Books. Our present purpose is to offer a condensed\r\nview of the della Rovere family, preceding its establishment in the\r\nsovereignty of Urbino, and to enliven what would otherwise be a dry\r\ngenealogical sketch, by a few passing observations on the character\r\nof its two Pontiffs, and on the influence of their reigns.\r\n\r\nThe children of Ludovico Leonardo della Rovere by Luchina Stella\r\nMuglione were these:--\r\n\r\n1. FRANCESCO, afterwards Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\n2. RAFFAELE, whose line will presently occupy our attention.\r\n\r\n3. A sister, whose husband Giovanni Basso and children were adopted\r\ninto the family of della Rovere and bore that name. They were:--\r\n\r\n     1. GIROLAMO of Recanate, made Cardinal of S.\r\n     Chrisogono in 1477, and died in 1507.\r\n\r\n     2. ANTONIO, who married in 1479 Caterina Marciana,\r\n     niece of Ferdinand of Naples, and died soon after.\r\n\r\n     3. GUGLIELMO, who died in 1482.\r\n\r\n     4. FRANCESCO, Prior of Pisa.\r\n\r\n     5. BARTOLOMEO.[208]\r\n\r\n4. IOLANDA, who married Girolamo Riario, and, dying in 1471,\r\nleft:--\r\n\r\n     1. CARDINAL PIETRO RIARIO, the favourite of his\r\n     Uncle Sixtus IV., who died in 1474.\r\n\r\n     2. GIROLAMO, Lord of Forlì, and, in right of his\r\n     wife, Caterina Sforza, sovereign of Imola, whose name is\r\n     familiar to those who have followed our narrative, and\r\n     who was assassinated in 1488. Among their children were\r\n     Ottaviano, dispossessed of his states by Cesare Borgia\r\n     in 1500; Orazio, Bishop of Lucca; Galeazzo; and Cesare,\r\n     Patriarch of Constantinople. Their line still subsists\r\n     in the Riario Sforza of Naples, one of whom was in 1846\r\n     Cardinal Camerlingo at Rome.\r\n\r\n     3. OTTAVIANO, Bishop of Viterbo.\r\n\r\n     4. A daughter, married to one Sansonio, whose son Raffaele,\r\n     made Cardinal of S. Giorgio in 1477, has been mentioned as\r\n     an accomplice in the Pazzi conspiracy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Most of these were buried in the church of Sta. Maria\r\ndel Popolo, at Rome, where their funeral inscriptions may be found.]\r\n\r\nRAFFAELE DELLA ROVERE, younger brother of Sixtus, had, by\r\nTeodora Manerola--\r\n\r\n1. BARTOLOMEO, Bishop of Ferrara and Patriarch of Antioch.\r\n\r\n2. GIULIANO, who became Pope Julius II., and whose natural children\r\nwere--\r\n\r\n     1. RAFFAELE, who married Niccolosa Fogliano of\r\n     Fermo, and was murdered in 1502.\r\n\r\n     2. FELICE, famed for her beauty and talents, who\r\n     married Gian-Giordano Orsini, not Marc Antonio Colonna, as\r\n     stated by Roscoe.\r\n\r\n3. LEONARDO, created Prefect of Rome in 1472. He died 1475,\r\nleaving no issue by Giovanna, natural daughter of Ferdinand King of\r\nNaples. According to Giannone, she was Catarina, daughter of the\r\nPrince of Rossano, by Dionora, sister of Ferdinand, and she brought\r\nhim the duchy of Sora, which descended to his heirs.\r\n\r\n4. GIOVANNI, Duke of Sora, Prefect of Rome, and Seigneur of\r\nSinigaglia, to whom we shall return.\r\n\r\n5. LUCHINA, whose children were adopted as of the della\r\nRovere name. By her first husband Gabriele Gara, a gentleman of\r\nSavona, she had--\r\n\r\n     1. RAFFAELE.\r\n\r\n     2. SISTO, Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vinculis, who\r\n     died in 1517, aged forty-four. His death is said to have\r\n     been occasioned by terror for the menaces of Leo X., who\r\n     suspected him of aiding his cousin the Duke of Urbino\r\n     in recovering his state, by advancing money out of vast\r\n     benefices, estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 ducats a year.\r\n     De Grasses describes his frame as exhausted by shameless\r\n     debaucheries, and adds, that he could neither read nor\r\n     write. The latter assertion is so incredible as to throw\r\n     doubt upon the former; yet such an accusation in the diary\r\n     of a papal master of ceremonies seems to infer that similar\r\n     immoralities were then scarcely regarded as scandalous in\r\n     the sacred college. The taint left by Alexander VI. had not\r\n     yet been effaced by blood and tears in the sack of Rome.\r\n\r\n     3. SISTA, whose first husband, Geraud d'Ancezun,\r\n     died in 1503, after which she married Galeazzo, son of\r\n     Count Girolamo Riario.\r\n\r\n     By her second husband, Gian-Francesco Franciotti Lucca,\r\n     a merchant in Rome, who was her junior by eleven years,\r\n     Luchina had--\r\n\r\n     4. GALEOTTO, Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vinculis,\r\n     and Archbishop of Benevento, who died in 1508, aged\r\n     twenty-eight. In 1505 he was appointed to the Cancelleria,\r\n     and his public revenues, amounting to 40,000 ducats a year,\r\n     were liberally administered in the patronage of letters.\r\n\r\n     5. NICOLÒ, who left a son Giulio.\r\n\r\n     6. LUCREZIA, wife of Marc Antonio Colonna, who\r\n     fell at the siege of Milan, in 1522.[209]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: Cristoforo and Domenico della Rovere, brothers, and\r\nsuccessively cardinals of San Vitale, were of the Vinovo family.\r\nThe former has a tomb in the Church del Popolo, the latter was\r\ndistinguished for his intelligent patronage of art. I have failed\r\nto affiliate Clemente, Bishop of Mende, surnamed _il Grasso_, made\r\ncardinal 1503, and died next year; and Stefano, who was nephew of\r\nJulius II., and had a son, Gian Francesco, Archbishop of Turin, who\r\ndied in 1517.]\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI DELLA ROVERE, Prefect of Rome and Seigneur of\r\nSinigaglia, died in 1501, having married in 1474 Giovanna di\r\nMontefeltro, who, dying in 1514, had issue--\r\n\r\n1. FEDERIGO, who died young.\r\n\r\n2. FRANCESCO MARIA, who, as Duke of Urbino, will occupy attention in\r\nour next Book.\r\n\r\n3. MARIA, married in 1497 to Venanzio Varana, Lord of Camerino, who\r\nwas slain in 1503, with three of his sons, by order of Cesare Borgia.\r\nAnother son, Sigismondo, shared the campaigns of his maternal uncle\r\nthe Duke of Urbino, and failing to recover his patrimonial state from\r\nthe usurpation of his uncle Giulio Cesare Varana, was assassinated\r\nat his instigation in 1522: his wife was Ottavia, daughter of Giulio\r\nColonna. A scandalous intrigue of Maria in her widowhood will be\r\nmentioned in the life of her brother,[210] but it did not prevent her\r\nfinding a second husband in Galeazzo, son of Girolamo Riario, Lord of\r\nForlì.\r\n\r\n4. COSTANZA, who died unmarried at Rome in November, 1507.\r\n\r\n5. DEODATA, a nun of Sta. Chiara at Urbino.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: See below, ch. xxxii.]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Sixtus, the papal treasury was supposed to be\r\nfull of money and jewels, which it had been the passion of Paul\r\nII. to accumulate. Yet he declared that but 5000 crowns were found\r\nin bullion, and the few precious stones that were forthcoming\r\nappeared not to have been paid for. Notwithstanding this seeming\r\ndisappointment, which was very generally discredited, and the outlay\r\nof 20,000 crowns for the funeral of Paul, and for his own coronation,\r\nhe discharged the debts of several antecedent pontiffs, and\r\nparticularly those due by Paul for St. Mark's palace. But these heavy\r\nexpenses, with the alleged simony attending his election, and the\r\nenormous sums lavished by his nephews, gave colour to an allegation\r\nthat he had seized and misapplied large hoardings of his predecessor.\r\nThe favour bestowed by him upon his nephews was excessive, even in\r\ndays when nepotism was at its height, and his fondness for the two\r\nRiarii originated suspicions casting a dark shadow upon his moral\r\ncharacter; while gossip, with its usual inconsistency, lent currency\r\nto the surmise that they owed to him their paternity as well as\r\nthe advancement of their fortunes.[211] One of his early acts was\r\nto confer upon Pietro, the elder of them, and upon Giuliano della\r\nRovere, cardinal's hats on the same day. These cousins were, however,\r\nof very opposite habits, and so long as Pietro lived, Giuliano's\r\ninfluence with his uncle was small. The former, known as Cardinal of\r\nS. Sisto,\r\n\r\n     \"Whom the wild wave of pleasure ever drove\r\n       Before the sprightly tempest, tossing light,\"\r\n\r\nwas magnificent beyond example, lavish in his tastes for silver and\r\ngold stuffs, splendid dresses, spirited horses. He was surrounded\r\nby troops of retainers, and filled his house with rising poets and\r\ncelebrated painters. He was munificent to the learned, generous to\r\nthe poor, and frequently celebrated public banquets and games at\r\nprodigious expense. Though he lived but two years and a half after\r\nhis elevation to the purple, he had in that brief space completed a\r\nrarely equalled career of civil and ecclesiastical preferment, of\r\npublic extravagance, and personal debauchery. Taddeo Manfredi, Lord\r\nof Imola, having been expelled by domestic intrigues, was bribed by\r\nthe Cardinal with 40,000 crowns to assign that fief to his brother\r\nGirolamo Riario, an arrangement sanctioned willingly by Sixtus,\r\nreluctantly by the consistory. After making a progress to Lombardy\r\nand Venice as papal legate, with a pomp unequalled even in an age\r\nof splendour, Pietro returned to Rome, and died in January 1474, of\r\nfever aggravated by previous excesses. Panvinio says he seemed born\r\nto waste money, and estimates his expenditure whilst cardinal at the\r\nenormous sum of 270,000 golden scudi.[212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Muratori has not scrupled to adopt this opinion, for\r\nwhich I can discover no adequate ground, and which is inconsistent\r\nwith the accepted genealogy of the Riarii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: The sumptuous and lavish festivities of the age, and\r\nthe extent to which art was combined with classical associations in\r\npublic displays, may be estimated from Corio's elaborate description\r\nof the reception at Rome, in 1473, of Duchess Leonora of Ferrara,\r\nwith her suite, including 60,000 horses. *Cf. _Annalisti di Tisi_,\r\nquoted by CORVISIERI, q.v. in _Archivio Romano_, vol. I.;\r\n_Il Trionfo Romano di Eleanora d'Aragona_. CREIGHTON, _op.\r\ncit._, vol. IV., pp. 75-77, gives a splendid sketch of his life.]\r\n\r\nThe wars into which the Pontiff recklessly plunged, from rage\r\nagainst the Medici and anxiety to consolidate a sovereignty for\r\nCount Girolamo, occasioned vast expense, and the deficiency of his\r\nexchequer led him to adopt expedients of an eventually dangerous\r\ntendency. Panvinio asserts for him a disreputable priority in the\r\ncreation of places and offices, in order to raise a revenue by their\r\nsale. The simony thus systematised tended at once to taint the\r\nmorals and degrade the reputation of the Roman court. Under Borgia's\r\npontificate we have seen it carried to a frightful height, and\r\nattended by scandals the most heinous; in that of Leo X. it became a\r\nmainspring of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nYet it was not by wars alone that the papal treasury was embarrassed,\r\nnor were the bounties of Sixtus limited to claims of nepotism, for\r\nhe reaped from many the praises due to a liberality large rather\r\nthan discriminating. The whirlwind of Turkish invasion had lately\r\nswept over the ruins of the Eastern Empire, and for the Christian\r\nprinces who fled before it, abandoning their states to seek a\r\nprecarious hospitality, Rome formed the natural refuge. Thither\r\ncame the expelled despots of Albania and the Morea, the crownless\r\nqueens of Cyprus and Bosnia, all of whom received from the Pontiff\r\na welcome and honourable entertainment due to their misfortunes and\r\nto their virtual martyrdom. To such European princes as visited\r\nthe Eternal City, in performance of their religious duties, he\r\naccorded a splendid reception. But there were other outlays still\r\nmore creditable to him, as adorning the city and ameliorating the\r\ncondition of its inhabitants. He was the first pope who earnestly\r\nset about rescuing from degradation the monuments of ancient Rome,\r\nand improving the modern city. Among numerous public buildings\r\nerected, restored, or decorated by him were the Ponte Sisto, the\r\ngreat hospital of Santo Spirito, the old Vatican Library, the\r\naqueduct of Trevi, the churches of La Pace, il Popolo, S. Vitale, S.\r\nSisto, S. Pietro in Vinculis, and many others. To the Riarii, by his\r\nencouragement, we owe the Cancelleria Palace and the adjoining church\r\nof S. Lorenzo in Damaso. The restoration of that of the SS. Apostoli,\r\nbegun on a grand scale by his nephew Pietro, was interrupted by the\r\nearly death of that dissolute minion, whose tomb remains in the\r\nchoir, finely conceived and beautifully executed. Nor was public\r\nconvenience overlooked amid such magnificent creations. As Augustus\r\nwas said to have replaced his capital of brick with one of marble,\r\nit became proverbial that Sixtus rebuilt in brick what he found of\r\nmud. He paved the streets, re-opened the sewers, conveyed the _aqua\r\nvergine_ to the heart of the city. By proclaiming the jubilee at the\r\nend of twenty-five years, instead of each half-century, he doubled\r\nthe influx of pilgrim revenues; and, warned by the catastrophe of\r\nits preceding celebration, when crowds had been trodden down on the\r\nPonte S. Angelo, he provided for the devout multitude a new access\r\nto S. Peter's by the bridge which bears his name. His beneficial\r\nundertakings, however, extended far beyond the Eternal City: he\r\ncleared out the choked harbour of Ostia, thoroughly repaired the\r\ncrumbling church of St. Francis at Assisi,[*213] and began, in\r\nhonour of the Santa Casa at Loreto, that gorgeous fane which was\r\nunworthily finished by the next Pontiff of his name. Neither was\r\nhe indifferent to the social disorganisation of his metropolis. He\r\ncurbed its lawless state by a rigorous police. Public begging was\r\nstrictly suppressed; and all who could not prove some legitimate\r\nmeans of livelihood were banished. Malefactors of every sort, after\r\nsummary conviction, were whipped through the streets, and consigned\r\nto the galleys or the gallows. Daily executions took place for a\r\ntime, and though the measures adopted were both sanguinary and\r\noppressive, order and security were in a great degree restored to the\r\nthoroughfares.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *213: Cf. FRATINI, _St. della Basilica e del\r\nConvento di S. Francesco in Assisi_ (Prato, 1882), p. 260 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to fear that the stern discipline, whereby he\r\nvindicated public manners, was not applied to his personal habits.\r\nYet the character given of him by Infessura, whereon depends most\r\nof the scandal by which his memory has been blackened, appears so\r\ngrossly exaggerated as to defeat its own end, and to establish a\r\ncharge of prejudice, if not of malevolence, against its author. To\r\ntranscribe it would be to stain our pages; but its purport is summed\r\nup in some ribald Latin verses, borrowed, probably, from Pasquin,\r\nwhich impute to the Pope every imaginable iniquity and disgraceful\r\nindulgence, and congratulate Nero in being at length exceeded in\r\ncrime.[*214]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *214: \"Sixtus,\" says CREIGHTON, \"changed the\r\ncourse of life in Rome because his own recklessness was heedless\r\nof decorum. Hitherto the Roman court had worn a semblance of\r\necclesiastical gravity.... Rome became more famous for pleasure than\r\nfor piety.... The Rovere stock was hard to civilise.... Hitherto the\r\nPapacy had on the whole maintained a moral standard; for some time to\r\ncome it tended to sink even below the ordinary level. The loss that\r\nwas thus inflicted upon Europe was incalculable\" (_op. cit._, vol.\r\nIV., p. 132-3).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the name of Sixtus, as a friend of letters and arts,\r\nhas been dimmed by the more glorious ones of Nicolas V. and Leo\r\nX., which at no long intervals preceded and followed him, the\r\nmemorials remaining of his judicious patronage are interesting and\r\nimportant. Innocent III., in building the Hospital of S. Spirito, had\r\nembellished it with six frescoes illustrative of its destination.\r\nTo these Sixtus added twenty-seven others, forming a cycle of\r\nthe personal and public incidents of his life, from his mother's\r\nmiraculous vision, to his anticipated introduction into Paradise by\r\nSt. Paul, in recompense of his piety. These paintings are no longer\r\nvisible; nor do we know from whose pencils the vast series emanated,\r\nbut in the Sistine Chapel, which perpetuates his name, and was his\r\nmost important artistic undertaking, his choice was unexceptionable.\r\nApart from the celebrity conferred upon it by the subsequent impress\r\nof Buonarroti's stupendous inventions, the series wherein the lives\r\nof our Saviour and of Moses are contrasted constitutes a chapter of\r\nscarcely equalled importance in the progress of Christian painting.\r\nWho can view the mighty themes of that oratory,--the types and\r\nantitypes of scriptural history on its walls, the creations of\r\nOmnipotence on its roof, the final Judgment over its altar,--without\r\ngratitude to the della Rovere pontiffs, by whom these triumphs were\r\ncommissioned, and for the most part carried out? This may, indeed,\r\nbe called the foundation of the Roman pictorial school. Giotto, Fra\r\nAngelico, Gentile da Fabriano, and Masaccio had, indeed, visited\r\nthe metropolis of Christendom, but no pontiff before Sixtus had\r\nsummoned hither, and at once employed, all the most distinguished\r\nartists of Central Italy. The glorious band, though headed by\r\nPerugino,[*215] consisted of Florentines,--Signorelli, Botticelli,\r\nRosselli, della Gatta, and Ghirlandaio; but these soon returned to\r\nthe art-loving and art-inspiring Arno, leaving on the plain of the\r\nTiber few other works, and a most transient influence, in exchange\r\nfor the classical ideas which they had imbibed in \"august, imperial\r\nRome,\" and which quickly supplanted the sacred traditions of their\r\nnative school. Although Pinturicchio was not associated in their\r\nlabours upon the Sistine, he was busy upon other not less important\r\nmural decorations, which still adorn the churches of Aracoeli, Sta.\r\nCroce in Gerusalemme, and S. Onofrio. But Sta. Maria del Popolo was\r\nespecially the scene of his triumphs, under the auspices of various\r\nCardinals della Rovere, and other members of the consistory, who were\r\ninstigated by example of his Holiness to such laudable employment of\r\ntheir exorbitant incomes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *215: Pinturicchio was also among them; neither can\r\nSignorelli be called a Florentine. Dennistoun is (_infra_) mistaken\r\nin thinking that Pinturicchio did not work in the Sixtine Chapel. The\r\nBaptism of Christ and the Journey of Moses are both from his hand.]\r\n\r\nPanvinio speaks of this Pope's solicitude to gather from all Europe\r\nadditions to the library founded by Nicolas V., and attest his having\r\nfirst put it upon a satisfactory footing, by appointing qualified\r\npersons to superintend it, and by assigning it an adequate endowment.\r\nThough the rooms in which he placed books have been devoted to other\r\npurposes, ever since Sixtus V. removed the augmented collection to\r\nits present site, a most interesting memorial of the Pontiff's family\r\nand court remains, and has till lately adorned its original locality.\r\nIt is a fresco, now transported to the Vatican Picture-gallery,\r\nwherein Sixtus sits in a noble hall of imposing architecture, with\r\nhis librarian Bartolomeo Sacchi, surnamed Platina, kneeling at his\r\nfeet, and pointing to an inscription, which enumerates in rough\r\nLatin verses, those ameliorations for which Rome was indebted to his\r\nHoliness. In attendance stand his two favourite cardinal nephews;\r\nPietro, with features expressive of unrefined sensualism, wearing the\r\nrusset habit of the mendicant fraternity, from whose discipline he\r\nemerged to lavish ill-gotten gold with rarely equalled prodigality;\r\nwhilst in the cold and unimpassioned countenance of Giuliano, we\r\nvainly seek for those massive features, and that angry scowl, which\r\nthe pencil of Raffaele subsequently immortalised. The group is\r\ncompleted by the two younger nephews, Girolamo, Lord of Forlì, gawky\r\nand common-place in figure, with the Prefect Giovanni, of blunt and\r\nburly aspect. It would be difficult satisfactorily to render so large\r\na group in these pages, but we give an unedited and speaking likeness\r\nof the Pontiff from a miniature of the same size prefixed to the MS.\r\nof Platina's _Lives of the Popes_, dedicated to him and now in the\r\nVatican Library.\r\n\r\nBesides the claims of this fresco upon our notice, from representing\r\nthe important members of the della Rovere family, it would be still\r\nmore interesting to us, were it, as formerly supposed, from the\r\npencil of Pietro della Francesca, court-painter of Urbino. It is now,\r\nhowever, ascribed, almost beyond question, to a pupil of his, sung by\r\nGiovanni Sanzi, as\r\n\r\n                     \"Melozzo, dear to me,\r\n     Who to perspective farther limits gave.\"\r\n\r\nHis accurate study of geometrical principles taught him the most\r\ndifficult art of foreshortening, which he particularly adapted\r\nto ceilings and vaulted roofs with a magical effect heretofore\r\nunattempted. Applying a like treatment to the human form, he\r\nsucceeded in giving to the features a relief not inferior to that\r\nattained by the plastic manner of Squarcione and his followers,\r\nbut infinitely excelling them in natural and noble character; and\r\nthus, for the first time since the revival, as in the picture just\r\ndescribed, he gave to simple portraiture the stamp of historical\r\ndelineation. Melozzo, by birth a Forlian, had probably attracted the\r\nnotice of Girolamo Riario, on taking possession of his new state,\r\nand the patronage bestowed upon him by the Count and his brother the\r\nCardinal, reflects credit upon their discrimination. In 1473, he was\r\nemployed by the latter to paint, in the apsis of SS. Apostoli at\r\nRome, our Lord's Ascension in presence of the apostles, one of the\r\ngrandest works of the time, miserably sacrificed by the destructive\r\nalterations of last century. Some much over-daubed fragments of this\r\nwonderful composition are built into the great stair at the Quirinal\r\nPalace, and single heads are preserved in the sacristy of St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nThe favour of this Pontiff, whom the prejudiced Infessura has\r\nlibelled as \"the enemy of literary and reputable men,\" included\r\nmerit from every quarter. Baccio Pintelli, of Florence, was his chief\r\narchitect; Antonio Venezianello was conjoined by him with the Umbrian\r\ndella Francesca and Signorelli to decorate the sacristy at Loreto;\r\nhe pensioned Andrea d'Assisi, when early blindness had clouded those\r\ngreat gifts ascribed to him by Vasari; the Tuscan Verrocchio, who had\r\ncome to Rome as a goldsmith, became, by his encouragement, a sculptor\r\nof eminence, and the inventor of that charming style which da Vinci\r\nbrought to perfection in Lombard painting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDeferring our notice of Giuliano, the favourite nephew of Sixtus\r\nIV., we shall now mention his younger brother GIOVANNI,\r\nimmediate ancestor of the della Rovere Dukes of Urbino. He was born\r\nin 1458, but we have no information as to his life before his uncle's\r\nelevation. The ancient and honourable dignity of Prefect of the\r\nfavoured [_alma_] city of Rome was held by the Colonna, from the time\r\nof Martin V., until the death of Antonio, Prince of Salerno, in 1472.\r\nHis son, Pier-Antonio, had been named to that office in reversion by\r\nPius II., but, upon the ground of nonage, Sixtus set aside his claim\r\nand appointed his own nephew Leonardo della Rovere. He, too, having\r\ndied in 1475, the Pontiff conferred the prefecture, (with remainder\r\nto his eldest son), on his next brother, Giovanni, to whom, on the\r\n12th of the preceding October, he had given an investiture, in full\r\nconsistory, of Sinigaglia, Mondavio, Mondolfo, and Sta. Costanza.\r\nAt the same time, his marriage with Giovanna, second daughter of\r\nFederigo, the newly-created Duke of Urbino, was celebrated with\r\nbecoming pomp, her dowry being 12,000 ducats; and on the 28th the\r\nalmost childish couple made a festive entry into their tiny state.\r\nThe Duke's presence and influence, though gladly given, were probably\r\nnot required to secure them a rapturous welcome, for elevation from\r\nobscure provincialism to petty independence was ever a welcome boon\r\nto an Italian community. To signalise and commemorate the auspicious\r\nevent, a young oak tree was planted in the piazza, with the motto in\r\nLatin, \"Long may it last,\" and was inaugurated amid boundless and\r\nuniversal joy. A tournament was next day celebrated, succeeded by a\r\nball, in which the sovereigns and their new subjects freely mingled.\r\n\r\nFrom the narrative of Fra Graziano[216] we learn the immense benefit\r\nwhich the new order of things brought to that hitherto obscure town.\r\nThough boasting a certain importance under imperial Rome, it had\r\nbecome so decayed as hardly to afford stabling for twenty horses.\r\nThe Prefect lost not a moment in meeting the exigencies of his\r\nposition; and though but a boy in years, proved himself possessed\r\nof matured wisdom. Summoning from all quarters the best architects\r\nand engineers, he opened new streets, and paved them; built palaces,\r\nchurches, convents, and a large hospital; constructed a harbour,\r\nerected a citadel, and fortified his capital. But his most happy\r\nexpedient was the encouragement of an annual fair, which, gradually\r\nextending in importance, rendered Sinigaglia a mart of commerce, and\r\ncontinues to this day the most important in Italy.[*217] Nor were\r\nhis exertions confined within the city. Mondaino and other places of\r\nminor note shared these improvements; and he brought from Lombardy\r\nand Romagna a population of skilful agriculturists, to clear and\r\ncultivate the forest lands which spread far around, until his state\r\nbecame a fertile and corn-exporting district.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *217: Cf. L. SIENA, _Storia di Sinigaglia_\r\n(Sinigaglia, 1764), p. 277 _et seq._; ANSELMI e\r\nMANCINI, _Bibliografia Sinigagliese_ (Sinigaglia, 1905);\r\nand MARCUCCI, _Francesco Maria I. della Rovere_, Parte I.\r\n(1490-1527) (Sinigaglia, 1903).]\r\n\r\nThe moral welfare of his people was meanwhile not overlooked; and\r\nthe strict propriety which he exerted himself to maintain, was\r\nenforced by example as well as by precept. In his own practice,\r\nand in the circle of his sanctimonious court, the decencies of\r\nlife were enforced with an almost monastic discipline, strangely\r\nat variance with the usages of his age, and the temperament of his\r\nnear relations. Fra Graziano sums up his character as moderate in\r\nhis tastes, prudent in his counsels, mild, liberal, and just in\r\nhis administration, devoutly religious in his observances. His\r\nconsort possessed virtues, graces, and accomplishments worthy of her\r\nhusband's merits and her own beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect does not, however, seem to have been able in person to\r\nsuperintend the beneficent administration which he had the good sense\r\nto institute, for the Pontiff's doating nepotism required much of\r\nhis presence after the loss of Pietro Riario. The youthful couple\r\naccordingly spent several years at the Vatican; and on their return\r\nhome, in 1479, Giovanni was presented by the city of Sinigaglia with\r\ntwelve silver cups weighing eighteen pounds. In 1482, they were\r\nagain sent for by Sixtus, who gave his nephew a palace on the Lago\r\ndi Vico. Even after his uncle's death, the Prefect enjoyed a large\r\nshare of papal favour, having from Innocent VIII., the baton as\r\ncaptain-general of the Church. But, on the accession of Alexander\r\nVI., the star of the della Rovere waned. In Cardinal Giuliano his\r\nHoliness saw a powerful and talented rival; in the Prefect an\r\nobstacle to his ambitious views for his bastard progeny. The former\r\nprudently retired to France; the latter lived quietly in his vicariat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1494, the Lord of Sinigaglia signalised himself by a feat worthy\r\nthe freebooting practice of his times. Zizim, or Gem, son of Mahomet\r\nII., had right by his father's will to half the Turkish empire, but\r\nwas expelled by his brother Bajazet, in 1482.[*218] Having fled\r\nto Rhodes, and placed himself under the protection of the Grand\r\nMaster, Bajazet offered the latter a pension of 40,000 (or as some\r\nsay 450,000) golden ducats, on condition of his being retained in\r\nsafe custody. From Rhodes he was removed to France, and, in 1489,\r\nwas brought to Rome, where, though received with much distinction by\r\nInnocent VIII., he found himself virtually a prisoner, or hostage.\r\nBajazet, after failure of an attempt to have him assassinated, agreed\r\nto pay that Pontiff and his successor, the same yearly subsidy of\r\n40,000 ducats for his custody and entertainment, besides supplying\r\nthe Holy See with various important Christian relics from Palestine.\r\nIn 1494, the Sultan's usual annual pension having been remitted to\r\nRome through one Giorgio Bucciardo, accompanied by costly presents\r\nfor Alexander VI., the envoy, on leaving Ancona, where he had\r\ndisembarked, was set upon and plundered by Giovanni della Rovere.\r\nAfter appropriating most of the treasure, to extinguish alleged\r\narrears of pay from the Holy See to himself and his troops, the\r\nPrefect sanctified the deed by dedicating the residue to pious works,\r\nemploying the rich oriental stuffs for church ornaments. Soon after,\r\nthere were circulated in Rome, certified copies of a correspondence\r\nbetween Alexander and the Sultan, with the oral instructions of his\r\nHoliness, which Bucciardo had been induced to divulge, and which\r\nthrows a curious colour on this chapter of diplomacy.[219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *218: The best contemporary account of Djem is that of\r\nGUGLIELMO CAOURSIN, _Obsidimis Rhodii Urbis Descriptio_\r\n(Ulm, 1496). Cf. BURCHARD (ed. Thuasne), I., p. 528.\r\nThe amount seems to have been 45,000 ducats. See especially\r\nHEIDENHEIMER, _Korrespondenz Bajazet II.'s mit Alexander\r\nVI._, in _Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte_, vol. V., p. 511 _et\r\nseq._ As usual, Creighton's account, _op. cit._, vol. IV., is\r\nmost excellent, written with the pen of a statesman. Heidenheimer\r\nmaintains the authenticity of the letters, and Creighton agrees\r\nwith him. \"If the letters were forged, the forgery was the work of\r\nGiovanni della Rovere,\" but there is no good ground for questioning\r\ntheir genuineness.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: These papers have been printed in Bossi's Italian\r\ntranslation of ROSCOE'S _Leo X._, vol. IV., p. 220; but our\r\nextracts were made from a MS. in Vat. Ottobon, Lib. No. 2206, f. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe envoy, on being accredited to the Sultan, had to state to his\r\nHighness, that the King of France was advancing upon Rome and\r\nNaples, in order to dispossess Alfonso, the Pope's vassal and ally,\r\nand to carry off Gem, with the project of providing him with a fleet,\r\nand supporting him in an invasion of Turkey. That as his Holiness had\r\nincurred great expenses in military preparations against a danger\r\nthus affecting the Sultan as well as himself, he prayed from him an\r\nadvance of the 40,000 ducats due in November, to be remitted by the\r\nbearer. And he was further to induce his Highness to adopt every\r\nmeans likely to alienate his Venetian allies from French interests in\r\nthe approaching struggle, and to attach them to the party of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan's answer is contained in a letter addressed to the\r\nPontiff, wherein this passage occurs:--\"For these reasons, we began,\r\nwith Giorgio Bucciardo, to consider that for your Potency's peace,\r\nconvenience, and honour, and for my satisfaction, it would be well\r\nyou should make the said Gem, my brother, die, who is deserving\r\nof death, and detained in your hands; which would be most useful\r\nto himself and your Potency, most conducive to tranquillity, and\r\nfurther, very agreeable to myself! And if your Mightiness is content\r\nto oblige me in this matter, as in your discretion we trust you will\r\ndo, it is desirable, for maintenance of your own authority, and for\r\nour full satisfaction, that your Mightiness will, in the manner\r\nthat seems best to you, have the said Gem removed from the straits\r\nof this world, transferring his soul to another life, where it will\r\nenjoy more quiet. And if your Potency will do this, and will send us\r\nhis body to any place on this side of our channel, we, the foresaid\r\nSultan Bajazet Chan, promise to pay 300,000 ducats at any place your\r\nMightiness may stipulate, that your Potency may therewith buy some\r\nsovereignties for your sons.\" To this cold-blooded offer are added\r\nmany general professions of eternal amity towards his Holiness, and\r\npromises that his subjects will everywhere forbear from aggression\r\nupon Christians; and after stating that he had in the envoy's\r\npresence taken his oath for the performance of all these obligations,\r\nhe concludes thus:--\"And further I, the aforesaid Sultan Bajazet\r\nChan, swear by the true God, who created the heaven, the earth, and\r\nall things therein, in whom we believe, and whom we adore, that I\r\nshall make performance of every thing contained above, and shall\r\nnever in any respect countermine or oppose your Mightiness. From\r\nour palace at Constantinople, the 15th of September, in the year of\r\nChrist's advent, 1494.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough discredit was thrown upon these documents by the Roman\r\ncourt, and the whole affair was alleged to be a device of Cardinals\r\ndella Rovere and Gurk, to screen the Prefect at the Pontiff's\r\nexpense,[220] it appears clear that a bribe was offered by Bajazet\r\nfor the destruction of his brother, who did not long survive this\r\nincident. Alexander accepted 20,000 ducats from Charles VIII. to put\r\nGem into his hands during six months, as a tool for his ambitious\r\ndesign upon the East; and in the treaty between his Holiness and\r\nthe French monarch, dated 15th January, 1495, there is a special\r\narticle that the former should consign \"the Turk\" to his Majesty\r\nas a hostage, to be kept in the castle of Terracina, or elsewhere,\r\nin the ecclesiastical territories, from whence Charles came under\r\na promise not to remove him \"unless in case of need, in order to\r\nprevent an invasion of the other Turks, or to make war upon them.\"\r\nHe also bound himself to defend the Pope from any descent of the\r\nInfidel upon the Adriatic coast, and, on quitting Italy, to restore\r\nGem to his custody, his Holiness meanwhile continuing to draw the\r\nSultan's pension, and for due observance of these conditions, Charles\r\nbound himself in a penalty of 800,000 ducats. By another article he\r\nundertook to arbitrate in the complaint brought against the Prefect,\r\nin the affair of Bucciardo and the captured subsidy. It is further\r\nstipulated that the Cardinal della Rovere should be restored to\r\nfavour, and replaced as legate at Avignon; and that, on termination\r\nof the Neapolitan enterprise, Ostia should be again surrendered into\r\nhis hands.[221]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: _Lettere de' Principi_, II., 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: _Molini Documenti di Storia Italiana_, I., 23.]\r\n\r\nThis oriental Prince's sudden demise, which soon followed, was\r\nattributed to various causes, but a general belief imputed it to\r\npoison, in implement of the Pope's engagement to Bajazet. Zizim\r\nis represented as far superior to his countrymen in mind and\r\nattainments; and we shall by and by find him honoured as a Maecenas\r\nof literature. A very different impression is, however, left by the\r\namusing, but obviously caricatured, description of him transmitted\r\nfrom Rome in 1489, by Andrea Mantegna, the painter, to his patron\r\nthe Marquis of Mantua:[222]--\"The Turk's brother is here, strictly\r\nguarded in the palace of his Holiness, who allows him all sorts of\r\ndiversion, such as hunting, music, and the like. He often comes to\r\neat in this new palace where I am painting,[223] and for a barbarian,\r\nhis manners are not amiss. There is a sort of majestic bearing about\r\nhim, and he never doffs his cap to the Pope, having in fact none; for\r\nwhich reason they don't raise the cowl to him either.[224] He eats\r\nfive times a-day, and sleeps as often; before meals he drinks sugared\r\nwater like a monkey. He has the gait of an elephant, but his people\r\npraise him much, especially for his horsemanship; it may be so, but\r\nI have never seen him take his feet out of the stirrups, or give any\r\nother proof of skill. He is a most savage man, and has stabbed, at\r\nleast, four persons, who are said not to have survived four hours.\r\nA few days ago, he gave such a cuffing to one of his interpreters\r\nthat they had to carry him to the river, in order to bring him round.\r\nIt is believed that Bacchus pays him many a visit. On the whole he\r\nis dreaded by those about him. He takes little heed of any thing,\r\nlike one who does not understand, or has no reason. His way of life\r\nis quite peculiar; he sleeps without undressing, and gives audience\r\nsitting cross-legged, in the Parthian fashion. He carries on his head\r\nsixty thousand yards of linen, and wears so long a pair of trowsers\r\nthat he is lost in them, and astonishes all beholders. Once I have\r\nwell seen him, I shall forward your Excellency a sketch of him, which\r\nI should send you with this, but that I have not yet fairly got near\r\nhim; for when he gives now one sort of look and then another, in the\r\ntrue inamorato style, I cannot impress his features on my memory.\r\nAltogether he has a fearful face, especially when Bacchus has been\r\nwith him. I shall no longer tire your Excellency with this familiar\r\njoking style; to whom I again and again commend myself, and pray your\r\npardon if too much at home.\" Homely it is in good earnest, being\r\nwritten in the Lombardo-Venetian dialect, some passages of which\r\nbaffle translation.[225]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: _Lettere Pittoriche_, VIII., p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: In the Belvidere, where his frescoes have\r\nunfortunately perished.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: Panvinio tells us that, being received in full\r\nconsistory on his arrival in Rome, he refused to kiss the Pope's toe,\r\nbut only his knee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: The reverse of this caricatured portrait may be\r\nfound in a curious account of this unfortunate prince's romantic\r\nadventures, given by the Turkish historian, Saadeddin-effendi,\r\nand printed by Masse in his _Histoire du Pape Alexander VI._, pp.\r\n382-408.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is, however, time to return from the digression into which this\r\nsingular and romantic history of the Turkish Prince has tempted us.\r\nAlexander, greatly exasperated by the insults put upon his envoy,\r\nand by the loss of a most opportune remittance, threatened the\r\nPrefect with deprivation of his state; but finding his people, and\r\nthe neighbouring communities prepared to stand by him, deferred his\r\nvengeance. Notwithstanding a reference of the whole affair to the\r\nFrench monarch, by the treaty of 1495, nearly six years elapsed ere\r\nGiovanni della Rovere was formally absolved from the daring exploit.\r\nHe was not spared to witness the revival and aggrandisement of\r\nhis family's fortunes by his elder brother's election to the papal\r\nthrone. On the 6th of November, 1501, death found him already attired\r\nin a winding-sheet appropriate to the devotional habits of the age,\r\nthe cowl formerly worn by the beatified Fra Giacomo della Marca.\r\n\r\nTwo miles west from Sinigaglia, on a rising ground which overlooks\r\nthe city, commanding the fertile vale of the Misa, from its Apennine\r\nrampart to the bright waves of the blue Adriatic, there stands a\r\nconvent of Zoccolantine Franciscans. It was founded by the piety\r\nof the Prefect and his consort; it was the chosen retreat of their\r\ndevotional hours, and was selected by them as the spot for their\r\nlast repose. There he was laid, agreeably to his dying wish, in\r\nthe Franciscan habit; and a plain marble slab in the pavement\r\ncommemorates his titles, and her worth, \"in prosperity and adversity\r\ncomparable, nay preferable, to the best and noblest of her sex.\"\r\nThere, too, was composed by Father di Francia, guardian of the\r\nconvent, that brief record of the merits of his sovereign and patron\r\nfrom which the preceding sketch has in part been compiled. The\r\noriginal MS. has disappeared in the general havoc of ecclesiastical\r\ntreasures; but in the adjoining church there has been marvellously\r\npreserved from the sacrilegious rapine of French invaders, from the\r\nselfish gripe of unscrupulous collectors, and from the merciless\r\nignorance of modern restorers, an interesting memorial of the\r\npersons, piety, and artistic tastes of this princely pair. Into a\r\nsmall picture of the Madonna and Child are introduced, on either\r\nside, portraits of Giovanni della Rovere and his wife, their arms\r\ndevoutly crossed, their dress displaying no royal gauds except her\r\nsimple string of pearls, and a large crystal bead suspended from his\r\nneck by a double gold chain. Their regular and unimpassioned features\r\nare, probably, somewhat idealised by the pencil of one more happy,\r\nas well as more habituated, to embody inspirations of religious\r\nmysticism, than to portray the indexes of human passion. Nothing is\r\nknown of the artist, but he must have been among the foremost in the\r\nUmbrian school.\r\n\r\nBy his will, the Prefect left his only son under the joint\r\nguardianship of the Venetian senate, his widow, his brother the\r\nCardinal, and the gallant Andrea Doria, whose faithful services\r\nwe have formerly mentioned. To his consort he bequeathed 20,000\r\nducats, and 7000 to each of his daughters. On the 18th of November,\r\nFrancesco Maria rode through Sinigaglia, to receive the allegiance\r\nof his subjects; but being only eleven years of age, his mother\r\ncontinued to govern for his behoof, whilst his education was chiefly\r\nconducted at the court of her brother, the Duke of Urbino. For a\r\ntime she was spared the fate of the Romagnese princes; and it was\r\nnot until Guidobaldo's second flight that the arms of Borgia reached\r\nher frontier. Aware how deeply her personal safety was perilled by\r\nthe approach of so sanguinary a foe, her friend Doria, who commanded\r\nthe garrison, sent her off disguised in male apparel; and, after\r\na fatiguing flight through mountain-paths, she reached Florence,\r\naccompanied only by one confidential servant and a female attendant.\r\nThe defence of her citadel against an overwhelming force being\r\nutterly vain, Doria retired just before the massacre of his allies by\r\nCesare Borgia, which we have recounted in our nineteenth chapter of\r\nthis work. There, too, we have narrated the young Prefect's escape\r\nto France, where he remained under his uncle's auspices, until the\r\nlatter was called to assume the triple tiara. Giovanna lived until\r\n1514, and passed from worldly trials just before adverse fortune had\r\nagain exiled her son from his rightful states. Ere we proceed to\r\nconsider his eventful life, we shall close this chapter with a few\r\nbrief notices of his uncle Giuliano, the greatest of the della Rovere\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn account of JULIUS II. should be, in a great degree, a\r\nhistory of Italy during the crisis of its fate; but as we have in\r\nother portions of this work to glance at those events of his life\r\nand pontificate most connected with the politics of Urbino, and with\r\nthe succession of his nephew to that duchy, we shall here, as in the\r\ncase of his uncle Sixtus, limit ourselves to a few notices of his\r\ncharacter and personal history, including his exertions in behalf of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nGiuliano della Rovere[*226] was in most respects the reverse of\r\nPietro Riario, his cousin and rival in the affections of Sixtus IV.\r\nModerate in his tastes and habits, his attendants were chosen for\r\ntheir orderly lives; his equipages were as scanty as the exigencies\r\nof rank would permit; his table was economical as his apparel,\r\nunless when called upon to show fitting hospitality to persons of\r\ndistinction. Among the virtues with which he adorned the dignity\r\nof cardinal, Panvinio enumerates the modesty of his demeanour, the\r\ngravity of his address, the elegance of his winning manners. The\r\nless partial Volterrano characterises him as somewhat severe in\r\ndisposition, and of a genius ordinary as his learning. Dignities were\r\nconferred upon him in rapid succession by his uncle, including the\r\nsees of Albano, Sabina, Ostia, Velletri, and Avignon, with the more\r\nimportant offices of Grand Penitentiary and Legate of Picene and\r\nAvignon. The latter appointment occasioned his prolonged residence\r\nout of Italy during the reign of Innocent VIII., and afforded him a\r\nconvenient escape from the snares of his inveterate enemy Alexander\r\nVI. Their mutual disgusts, arising from opposite characters and rival\r\ninterests, were, according to Infessura, brought to a climax by the\r\nCardinal's adherence to Neapolitan interests, in December, 1492, on\r\nthe question of Leonora Queen of Hungary's divorce. He then retired\r\nto his citadel-see at Ostia, where, at the abbey of Grotta Ferrata,\r\nhis moats and battlements remain, witnesses to his warlike spirit,\r\nas well as to the perils of those troubled times. But, considering\r\nhimself even there insecure, he ere long withdrew to Naples, whence,\r\nafter narrowly escaping seizure by the Pope's emissaries, he again\r\nreached Ostia in an open boat. On the approach of an army under\r\nNicolò Count of Pittigliano, he fled thence to France, leaving the\r\ngarrison in charge of the Prefect, who soon capitulated, on condition\r\nthat neither he nor his brother should incur ecclesiastical censures.\r\nGrotto Ferrata was about the same time seized and delivered over to\r\nFabrizio Colonna, on payment of 10,000 ducats.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *226: For authorities for Pope Julius II., cf.\r\nCREIGHTON, vol. V., pp. 305-6, where an excellent _résumé_\r\nis given.]\r\n\r\nThe outrages which the Cardinal had thus received at the hands of\r\nthe Borgian Pontiff, in unworthy vengeance for his honest opposition\r\nto the nepotism and other scandals which then disgraced the Vatican,\r\ngalled his pride, tending to rouse that fierce spirit which, although\r\nalien to the character ascribed to his earlier years, became the\r\nbane of his pontificate. This was, indeed, the turning point of\r\nhis life, and it developed a policy utterly at variance with his\r\nultimate views. Having attended Charles in his march across the Alps,\r\nhis ardent temperament often aided to sustain that weak monarch's\r\nwavering resolutions. Had he then considered more his country's\r\ninterests, and less his private wrongs, the storm might yet have been\r\naverted, and Italy might have been spared, for a time, from those\r\nultramontane armaments which he now conducted into her bosom, but\r\nwhich it was the aim of his after-life to eject. The French King,\r\nhaving achieved his rapid acquisition of Naples, instigated the\r\nColonna to seize upon Ostia, and, as he passed northward, restored\r\nit to its cardinal-bishop, who there once more sought security\r\nfrom the Pope. But Giuliano found in his stronghold no adequate\r\nprotection against so bitter and unscrupulous a foe. Alexander, on\r\nthe retirement of the French army, entered into an alliance with the\r\nreinstated King of Naples, and in 1497 employed Gonsalvo di Cordova\r\nto reduce Ostia, whose garrison had embarrassed the navigation of the\r\nTiber, and intercepted supplies from his capital. Eschewing the risks\r\nof an unavailing resistance, the Cardinal once more escaped by sea,\r\nand rejoined Charles at Lyons, whilst the Great Captain was rewarded\r\nfor his easy conquest with the Golden Rose.\r\n\r\nCardinal della Rovere, having in 1597 been declared enemy of the Holy\r\nSee, and deprived of his benefices by the Pontiff, against the will\r\nof the consistory, withdrew for security to his native shores, and\r\nawaited at Savona the conclusion of what was to many of his order\r\na reign of terror. At the moment of Cesare Borgia's invasion of\r\nUrbino, he narrowly escaped the fate destined for his brother-in-law\r\nGuidobaldo, and his nephew, the young Prefect. On pretence of a\r\ncomplimentary mission to Louis XII., the papal fleet had sailed\r\ntowards Provence, with orders to visit Savona, where, if the Cardinal\r\ndid not voluntarily pay his respects to the envoys, he was to be\r\ninveigled on board, and carried off. But warned by past experience\r\nagainst civilities emanating from such a quarter, he escaped the\r\ndanger by cautiously evading the perilous invitation.\r\n\r\nThe sudden and unanimous election of Giuliano to succeed Pius\r\nIII.--which we have elsewhere narrated--may well be deemed\r\nmarvellous, considering the various interests that distracted the\r\nconclave, and the influence still ostensibly possessed in it by\r\nValentino, the arch-foe of the Rovere race. There could be no more\r\nconvincing proof that all parties were tired of the recent system,\r\nnor of their resolution to put an end to similar enormities. His\r\nmorals, though hitherto far from immaculate, were pure in comparison\r\nwith those which prevailed around him; above all, his lapses were\r\nneither matter of bravado, nor of open scandal.[227] His errors were\r\nof a loftier range, and if more directly perilous to the public,\r\nthey belonged to a nobler category, and sprang from generous and\r\npraiseworthy impulses, and tended to public objects and the elevation\r\nof the papacy. Ascending a throne shaken by complicated convulsions,\r\nsucceeding to a treasury drained for selfish ends, and to an\r\nauthority waning under long-established abuses, it was his bounden\r\nduty to beware _ne aliquid detrimenti respublica capiat_. But, not\r\ncontent with resisting such further \"detriment to the commonwealth,\"\r\nand with recovering the ground recently lost, his conscience, more\r\nperhaps than his ambition, urged him to new triumphs. He was a great\r\npontiff after the mediæval estimate of the papacy. Little occupying\r\nhimself with the bulwarks of a faith which he presumed impregnable,\r\nor the dogmas of a church still paramount over Christendom, he\r\nconsidered the temporal sovereignty and aggrandisement of the Keys to\r\nbe his special vocation. Like the early Guelphs, he regarded Italy\r\nas St. Peter's patrimony, to be vindicated from all intruders: to\r\nestablish her nationality, and extirpate the barbarian invaders,\r\nwere merely steps to that end. Italian unity, though not as yet\r\nproposed for political aspirations or utopian dreams, was the result\r\ntowards which this policy would probably have led both Julius and\r\nhis successor, had the former been longer spared, and had the narrow\r\nviews with which the latter pursued it not involved him in continual\r\ndifficulties, and accelerated the decline of papal ascendancy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: He had certainly two natural children, and Bernardo\r\nCapello alludes to the inroads upon his constitution, occasioned\r\nby gout and _morbus Gallicus_ (Ranke, App., sect. i., No. 6); the\r\nlatter term seems, however, to have been often in that age completely\r\nmisapplied.]\r\n\r\nBut no personal ambition ever dictated the schemes of Julius, nor\r\ndid a thought for the nations whose destinies he hazarded ever cross\r\nhis mind. In the spirit of a crusader he marched against Perugia and\r\nBologna; he personally superintended the siege of Mirandula; and\r\nwhen he donned the casque and cuirass, it was because they were to\r\nhim more familiar than the wiles of diplomacy. A stranger to those\r\ndilatory tactics which we shall find marring the reputation of his\r\nnephew, the Duke of Urbino, success crowned his aggressive measures\r\nand impetuous movements, when greater circumspection might have\r\nbeen attended with less advantageous results; and it was his good\r\nfortune not to outlive those reverses which his precipitation almost\r\nnecessarily incurred. He was, in truth, gifted with qualities and\r\ntalents befitting the camp rather than the consistory, and Francis I.\r\npronounced him a better general of division than a pope. Had he been\r\nbred a condottiere, the political aspect of Italy might have been\r\nconvulsed by him, and the papacy might have suffered still more from\r\nhis sword than it did from his policy. Yet if his militant tastes\r\noccasioned greater scandal than the less blustering turbulence of\r\nAlexander and Leo, and have proved equally detrimental to popery,\r\nthey are hallowed in the eyes of its champions in consideration\r\nof his purer motives. By them accordingly he is upheld as one of\r\nits pillars, while by most historians he has been mentioned as a\r\nfavourable exception to the prevailing bad faith of his times. Yet,\r\nthough greedy of conquest, he was far from indifferent to those\r\ninternal reforms requisite for the stability of his government.\r\nAccording to Capello, the Venetian envoy, he possessed great\r\npractical sagacity, and was led by no one, though willing to hear\r\nall opinions. His judicious measures added two-thirds to the revenue\r\nof the Holy See, chiefly by correcting the depreciated currency in\r\nwhich it was paid. In personal expenses he was penuriously sparing,\r\ncontracting with his house-steward, to whom he allowed but 1500\r\nducats for the monthly bills of the palace.[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: Ranke, Appendix, sect. i. No. 6.]\r\n\r\nBut this picture has its reverse. In the two following chapters\r\nof these memoirs we shall find the head of the universal Church\r\nharassing his flock by perpetual warfare--the high-priest of the\r\nChristian hierarchy seemingly indifferent to the purity of Catholic\r\nrites, and utterly oblivious of peace and charity.\r\n\r\nBy lovers of art the memory of Julius II. will ever be embalmed\r\namong the foremost of its princely patrons, and his appreciation\r\nof literature may be learned from his remark, that letters are\r\nsilver to the people, gold to the nobles, diamonds to princes. We\r\nhave elsewhere to speak of his vast undertakings in architecture,\r\nsculpture, and painting, which earned from Vasari the reputation\r\nof a spirited pontiff, bent upon leaving memorials of a zealous\r\nand liberal encouragement of art. His lavish outlay on St. Peter's\r\nstrikingly contrasts with his habitual economy. To meet it he\r\nauthorised a general collection, towards which the Franciscans\r\ngathered 27,000 ducats, and in 1507 he proclaimed a sale of jubilee\r\nindulgences. This device laid all Christendom under contribution, and\r\nproved so productive that he and Leo were tempted almost annually\r\nto repeat it, little aware what weapons they were thus forging for\r\nfuture schismatics. The example of his uncle Sixtus, in summoning for\r\nthe decoration of his capital whatever talent merited such patronage,\r\nwas followed up by him with the energy belonging to his nature.\r\nBesides commencing the metropolitan fane, the immense _cortile_,\r\ncorridors, and _loggie_ of the Vatican, and the unequalled frescoes\r\nof the _stanze_, he was truly the founder of a museum of ancient art.\r\nHe rescued the Laocoon and rewarded its discoverer; the Apollo and\r\nthe Torso took their epithet of Belvidere from the pavilion in which\r\nhe placed them.\r\n\r\nRome owes to him, among other improvements, one of its longest and\r\nfinest streets, bearing his name, where he began a series of palaces\r\nfor public offices and the courts of justice, unfortunately never\r\ncompleted. The churches which he re-founded or decorated include\r\nS. Pietro in Montorio, Sta. Agnese, SS. Apostoli, and the Madonna\r\ndel Popolo. In the last of these are the beautiful windows which\r\nhe brought two famous glass-painters from Marseilles to execute;\r\nand beneath them those purest specimens of the revival, in which he\r\ninvited Sansovino's exquisite chisel to commemorate his talented\r\nrival Ascanio Sforza, and his cousin the Cardinal of Recanati. For\r\nobjects so laudable the moment was propitious, and fortune seconded\r\nhis efforts; but it was more than chance which enabled him to select\r\nat once the greatest painter, the most gifted sculptor, and the first\r\narchitect whom the modern world has seen,--to give simultaneous\r\nemployment worthy of their genius to Raffaele, Michael Angelo, and\r\nBramante.\r\n\r\nHis successor has found among ourselves a biographer[*229] who\r\nbrought the enthusiasm of a eulogist to grace the more solid\r\nqualifications of a historian, whose eloquence has thrown around\r\nthe era of Leo a brilliancy leaving in comparative obscurity the\r\npontificate of Julius, whence many of its rays were virtually\r\nborrowed. But the progress of our narrative will lead us to introduce\r\nsome less flattered sketches of the Medicean pontiff. In stimulating\r\nthe search for choice fragments of antique sculpture, the son of\r\nLorenzo de' Medici but followed the course which his father had\r\nindicated, and which Julius had zealously pursued. St. Peter's,\r\nperverted under him into a crowning abuse destined to wean men from\r\ntheir old faith, had been founded by his predecessor as the mighty\r\ntemple of a church, Catholic in fact as well as in name. Michael\r\nAngelo, summoned by Julius to decorate his capital with the grandest\r\nof his efforts in architecture, sculpture, and painting, was banished\r\nby his successor to waste his energies in engineering the marble\r\nquarries of Pietra Santa. Raphael was diverted by Leo from that cycle\r\nof religious frescoes which the genius of Julius had commissioned,\r\nin order to distract his powers upon multifarious, less important,\r\nand less congenial occupations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *229: WILLIAM ROSCOE, _Life of Leo X._, 4 vols.\r\n(3rd ed.), 1847.]\r\n\r\nNor need we fear a comparison between these pontiffs on more\r\nimportant points of their respective policy. The wars of Julius were\r\nundertaken for the aggrandisement of the papacy, and his nephew was\r\nused as an instrument to that end. Those of Leo were waged for the\r\ninterests of his family at the expense of the Holy See. The former is\r\nreported to have left five millions of golden ducats in the treasury;\r\nthe latter unquestionably burdened it with heavy debts. The measures\r\nof Julius may have encouraged divisive courses and a schismatic\r\ncouncil; but those of Leo matured the Reformation, and permitted a\r\nsmall cloud, which he might have dispersed while forming upon the\r\nhorizon, to spread unheeded over the heavens, until Central Europe\r\nwas withdrawn from the light and influence of the Roman church.\r\n\r\nIn fine, during the pontificates of Sixtus and of Julius more was\r\ndone for the encouragement of literature and arts, for the temporal\r\nextension of the papacy, and for the embellishment of its metropolis,\r\nthan has ever been effected in any similar period. The combined\r\nreigns of the two Medicean popes have left no equal memorials. It\r\ncannot be doubted that the patronage bestowed by his ancestors on\r\nmen of science and letters was liberally continued by Leo; yet it is\r\nas much to the zeal of partial historians, as to his own policy of\r\nsuccess, that he stands indebted for the halo of glory which marks\r\nhis as a golden age. In many instances he but followed out the aims\r\nof Julius, reaping their undivided glory; in others he fell sadly\r\nshort of his predecessor in energy and comprehensive views. The bad\r\nseed which he freely scattered ripened into irreparable mischiefs\r\nunder his vacillating nephew, and the sack of Rome, which we shall by\r\nand by describe, was their crowning calamity. After that event the\r\nproud city was once again left desolate and impoverished, the prey\r\nof barbarian spoilers; its population thinned, its court outraged,\r\nits glories gone. When the judgment of posterity has passed into a\r\nproverb it is too late to question its equity, or to appeal from its\r\nfiat, and the name of Leo the Tenth will thus remain identified with\r\nhis age as the star whence its lustre was derived, although Italy was\r\nthen brightened by not a few orbs of scarcely inferior brilliancy or\r\nless genial influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK SIXTH\r\n\r\n  OF FRANCESCO MARIA DELLA ROVERE\r\n  FOURTH DUKE OF URBINO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n     Youth of Duke Francesco Maria I.--The League of\r\n     Cambray--His marriage--His first military service--The\r\n     Cardinal of Pavia's treachery--Julius II. takes the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the family della Rovere, whom we have traced in the preceding\r\nchapter, an heir was born on the 25th of March, 1490. His father,\r\nthe Lord Prefect, acknowledged his arrival to be a divine blessing,\r\nand, as then usual, testified gratitude by the selection of his\r\nbaptismal names. St. Francis was the established tutelary saint of\r\nthe family, under whose guidance Sixtus IV. believed himself to have\r\nobtained the tiara, and to whom his brother the Prefect addressed his\r\norisons for a male child. It came into the world on the fête of the\r\nAnnunciation, and was immediately christened Francesco Maria,[*230]\r\nin honour of the saint and of the Madonna. In this, his only male\r\noffspring, centred the hopes and interests of the Lord of Sinigaglia;\r\nand after his death, in 1501, the boy was carried to the court of\r\nUrbino, where his progress was watched with almost paternal anxiety\r\nby Duke Guidobaldo. His mother occasionally visited there after her\r\nwidowhood, although from motives of perhaps misplaced delicacy,\r\nshe resided chiefly on her husband's fiefs of Sora and Arci in the\r\nNeapolitan territory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *230: See MARCUCCI: _Francesco Maria I. della\r\nRovere_ (Sinigaglia, 1903).]\r\n\r\nThe first care of his uncle Guidobaldo was to obtain for him a\r\nrenewal of the prefecture of Rome, which his father had held; and as\r\nthat appointment was in the hands of Alexander VI., an enemy of the\r\ndella Rovere, the Duke of Urbino had recourse to the influence of\r\nLouis XII. with the Pontiff. This application was warmly seconded in\r\nthe same quarter by the Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vinculis, paternal\r\nuncle of Francesco Maria, and an adherent of the French interests.\r\nThe readiness wherewith his Holiness accorded this dignity, and even\r\nheld out hopes of marrying his niece, Angela Borgia, to the young\r\nPrefect, induced his uncles to hint at their project of adopting him\r\nas heir to the dukedom, a step which required the papal sanction. But\r\nthey were met by temporising answers, and found, ere long, that the\r\napparent frankness of Alexander was but a cover to that deep-laid\r\nplot of destruction, involving both Guidobaldo and his nephew, which\r\nwe have already developed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Francesco Maria's education advanced in letters and arms,\r\nwith every aid which books, talented preceptors, and distinguished\r\nsociety could afford. His earliest instructor had been Antonio\r\nCrastini of Sassoferrato, a man of excellent judgment, and well\r\nskilled in theology and philosophy, to whom his father had entrusted\r\nthe command of Sinigaglia, and whose services were eventually\r\nrewarded by Julius II. with the sees of Cagli and Montefeltro.\r\nLudovico Odasio still resided at the court of his former pupil\r\nDuke Guidobaldo, who placed under his superintendence his youthful\r\nrelation. The lad, though small in stature for his years, was\r\nremarkable for strength and activity, as well as for an active\r\ntemperament and lively talents. He was liberal, and even careless,\r\nof money; but all his pleasure was in the military art, all his\r\nambition centred in martial glory, for Nicolò of Fossombrone,\r\nand another famous astrologer, had predicted from his horoscope\r\nhigh deeds of arms. After passing hours in the study of history\r\nand classical literature, and of those sciences wherein princes\r\nthen sought pre-eminence, he found relaxation in horsemanship and\r\nmartial exercises, under the eye of such honoured veterans of Duke\r\nFederigo as still wore their well-won laurels in the palace of\r\nhis son. Thus was his youthful mind moulded to the noblest forms of\r\nchivalry, without those idle appendages which the affectation of\r\nother times has exaggerated into caricature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nFRANCESCO MARIA I DELLA ROVERE\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence_\r\n\r\n_(From the Ducal Collection)_]\r\n\r\nThe whirlwind that broke in upon this calm, and sent the Lords of\r\nUrbino and Sinigaglia into houseless exile, has been described in\r\nthe eighteenth chapter of these memoirs. Francesco Maria, after\r\naccompanying his uncle's midnight flight as far as Sta. Agata,\r\nreached Bologna through mountain paths; and, having by great prudence\r\nescaped the attempts of Giovanni Bentivoglio to apprehend him, in\r\ncompliance with Valentino's orders, he made his way by Genoa to\r\nSavona, where his uncle, the Cardinal della Rovere, resided. But\r\nthe latter, not satisfied of his security, and anxious to place him\r\nwhere he would have better means of improvement, sent him to his see\r\nof Avignon, and thence recommended him to Louis XII., who received\r\nhim with high favour. In the court then established at Lyons he\r\nresumed his education, especially in those military and personal\r\naccomplishments for which it was distinguished, and quickly acquired\r\ngreat proficiency in the French language. There he attached himself\r\nmuch to the youthful Gaston de Foix, acting as his page of honour,\r\nand gained some notice from the King, who bore testimony to his\r\nprecocious attainments in chivalry, by bestowing upon him the order\r\nof St. Michael ere he had completed his thirteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe events already recorded in connection with the death of Alexander\r\nVI., restored Francesco Maria to his rights unquestioned; but his\r\nfirst care was to obey a summons of his cardinal uncle, who had been\r\nelected to the tiara. Travelling from France with his cousin-german\r\nGaleotto Franciotti, whom Julius had named to the hat just vacated by\r\nhimself, he reached Rome amid public rejoicings on the 2nd of March,\r\n1504. He immediately received the command of a hundred men-at-arms,\r\nand steps were promptly taken for his public recognition as\r\nheir-apparent of Urbino. Accompanying Guidobaldo into the Marca, he\r\nwas welcomed at Sinigaglia, on the 17th of June, by the unanimous\r\nvoice of his people. On the 18th of September he was invested with\r\nthe dukedom of Urbino in reversion, when he received the homage of\r\nhis future subjects with a ceremonial which we have described at p.\r\n37, and which was attended by delegates from all parts of the state,\r\nto adhibit the consent of their constituents. As a finishing stroke\r\nto these measures for consolidating the della Rovere sovereignty, a\r\nmarriage was about the same time contracted between the Prefect and\r\nLeonora Gonzaga, daughter of Francesco Marquis of Mantua. To this\r\narrangement, which turned out in all respects fortunate, the wishes\r\nof her aunt, the Duchess Elisabetta of Urbino,[*231] were mainly\r\nconducive; and preliminaries were negotiated by Count Castiglione,\r\nwhose high favour with both contracting parties, as well as his\r\ndiplomatic address, well qualified him for the mission. It was\r\nannounced in January, 1505, but the ceremony was postponed for\r\nfour years, on account of their youth. To the charms of the bride,\r\nCastiglione bears this tribute: \"If ever there were united wisdom,\r\ngrace, beauty, genius, courtesy, gentleness, and refined manners,\r\nit was in her person, where these combined qualities form a chain\r\nadorning her every movement.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *231: She was betrothed in the same month in which her\r\nfather died. The marriage had long been desired by Elisabetta.\r\nGiustiniani mentions a report of it in his Despatches (_Dispacci_,\r\nvol. II., p. 359) even in 1503. Mrs. ADY (_Isabella d'Este_,\r\nvol. I., p. 267) says the Marquis of Mantua desired it \"as a means of\r\nobtaining the Cardinalate which he had been striving to obtain for\r\nhis brother during the last fifteen years.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nVENETIAN WEDDING-DRESS IN SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n_After the picture called \"La Flora\" by Titian in the Uffizi Gallery,\r\nFlorence_]\r\n\r\nBut although too young for matrimony, the Prefettino was allowed to\r\nflesh his maiden sword under his future father-in-law's command, in\r\nthe expedition undertaken by Julius against the lords of Perugia and\r\nBologna. In a military view the campaign was totally uninteresting;\r\nbut in some skirmishes before Castel S. Pietro, Francesco Maria\r\ngained his general's approbation, and thus favourably entered upon\r\nthe career wherein he was destined to high distinction. The greater\r\npart of his time was spent at Urbino, acquainting himself with the\r\npeople over whom he was to reign, and with the duties that awaited\r\nhim. Its limited court was rich in merit, and beneath an exterior\r\nof elegance and high polish, learning and accomplishments of every\r\nsort were cultivated and honoured to a degree elsewhere unknown.\r\nThe laxity of morals which, notwithstanding the example of both\r\nsovereigns, accompanied that refinement, may be estimated from an\r\nanecdote sadly instancing the failing in Francesco Maria's character,\r\nwhich proved the bane of his whole life. We shall narrate it in the\r\nwords of an anonymous diary, already largely drawn upon for the reign\r\nof Guidobaldo I.[232] \"The Duke, [Guidobaldo] having brought up about\r\nhis person one Giovanni Andrea, a bravo of Verona, he made him his\r\nfavourite, and conferred upon him the order of the Golden Spur, as\r\nwell as the fief of Sasso-Corbaro, and some mills on the Foglia. He\r\nwas extremely handsome and generally liked; and it happened that\r\nMadama Maria, daughter of the late Prefect Giovanna of Sinigaglia,\r\nand widow of Venanzio of Camerino, who had been slain by Cesare\r\nBorgia, was residing in Urbino with her son. Being still young, she\r\nfell in love with this Giovanni Andrea, and was reported to have\r\nborne him a son. Whereupon her brother, the Prefect, sent for him one\r\nSaturday evening, and in the ducal chamber beset him with his people,\r\nand assassinated him with twenty-four blows. At the same moment,\r\none of his attendants went out and slew a servant of Madama Maria,\r\nwho was said to have delivered their messages. On the following\r\nevening, being Sunday, the body was carried to the cathedral with\r\ndistinguished honours, accompanied by all the gentlemen of the ducal\r\nhousehold, and by a concourse of the citizens, for he was generally\r\nlamented by persons of every rank, and no one had died for a length\r\nof time more regretted. And this occurred on the 6th of October,\r\n1507.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 904, f. 89.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere endeavoured to sketch the brilliant society in\r\nwhich the Prefect's youthful mind was developed; in due time we shall\r\nfind several of its prominent members crossing him in the tangled\r\nweft of human destiny, as friends or foes, according to their several\r\ninterests. We have also noticed the affectionate duty he continued to\r\ninterchange with the Duke and Duchess, and the circumstances in which\r\nhe succeeded to their state. Guidobaldo closed his life of suffering\r\non the 11th of April, 1508, and on the 14th Francesco Maria, after\r\nhigh mass in the cathedral, produced the will naming him heir of the\r\nduchy and dignities.[*233] The gonfaloniere of Urbino then presented\r\nto him the city keys in a great silver basin, and also its standard,\r\naccompanied with a complimentary address. He next was arrayed in the\r\nducal mantle of white satin doubled with gold brocade, and a cap\r\nfaced with ermine, over which was placed the coronet; then mounting a\r\nsuperb charger richly housed, he was escorted through the principal\r\nstreets by an enthusiastic multitude shouting \"ROVERE and\r\nFELTRO, DUKE and PREFECT!\" in whose joyous hurrahs it would have been\r\ndifficult to identify the disconsolate populace who not many hours\r\nbefore had raised their coronach over Guidobaldo's mortal remains. On\r\nreturning, his horse was seized as their perquisite, and his mantle\r\ntorn into shreds, which were scrambled for as relics to be treasured\r\nin memory of the day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *233: Cf. LUZIO E RENIER, _Mantova ed Urbino_\r\n(Torino, 1893), p. 182.]\r\n\r\nThis spontaneous loyalty, and their satisfaction at the maintenance\r\nof their national independence, did not, however, prevent the\r\ncitizens from recollecting their interests. On the new Duke's first\r\nappearance at Urbino the authorities had gathered round his horse to\r\nkiss his hands and knees, and to beseech attention to their wishes.\r\nPleading recent fatigues, he declined entering then upon business,\r\nand the gonfaloniere, readily accepting the excuse, summoned a sort\r\nof parliament of the principal inhabitants to decide what favours\r\nand privileges should be asked as a preliminary to their homage.\r\nEstimating this movement at its actual value, rather than by its\r\nbearing upon any theories of self-government, Baldi has entered into\r\nno details of these demands: their object may, however, be guessed\r\nat from the municipal concessions made by Francesco Maria on the\r\n31st of May, whereby precedence was granted to the gonfaloniere over\r\nthe podestà; and the salaries of the city physician, lawyer, and\r\nschoolmaster were undertaken by the sovereign, who also consented to\r\na modification of the imposts on agricultural produce.[*234]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *234: The document is printed by LUZZATTO, _Comune\r\ne principato in Urbino nei secc. xv. e xvi._, in _Le Marche_ (1905),\r\nAn. v., p. 196 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nAlthough the popularity both of the extinguished dynasty and of the\r\nyouth who was destined to replace it, together with an absence of\r\nall conflicting claims, rendered the succession safe and certain,\r\nevery measure which prudence could suggest had been taken by the\r\nPope to secure its being peacefully effected. A few excitable\r\nspirits having assumed arms, in apprehension of some revolutionary\r\nmovement, a proclamation was issued on the morning subsequent to\r\nthe Duke's decease, commanding all to lay them down. On the 17th a\r\npapal brief was addressed to the people, condoling with them on their\r\nbereavement, and applauding their dutiful and orderly reception of\r\nFrancesco Maria. An envoy, deputed by the community to present their\r\nanswer, returned on the 30th, delighted with the gracious reception\r\nhe had met with, and with the Pontiff's flattering assurances. The\r\nceremony of swearing allegiance was out of delicacy postponed until\r\nthe 3rd of May, the day subsequent to his respected predecessor's\r\nfuneral. Summonses for both solemnities were issued to the various\r\ncommunities in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     \"Right well-beloved,\r\n\r\n     \"On the second of the ensuing month will be celebrated the\r\n     obsequies of the illustrious Lord Duke, our father of happy\r\n     memory, for which it behoves you to send here in good time\r\n     as many as possible of your well-qualified fellow-citizens,\r\n     suitably dressed for the occasion. And to such of them\r\n     as you shall please to choose, you shall give a special\r\n     mandate for adhibiting the oath of fidelity to us in name\r\n     of your community, taking care that it be in regular form\r\n     as a public instrument. From Urbino, this 25th of April,\r\n     1508.\r\n\r\n     \"FRANCISCUS MARIA DUX URBINI, ALMÆ URBIS\r\n     PRÆFECTUS.\"\r\n\r\nThe deputations willingly rendered the required homage, for they\r\nconsidered this perpetuation of their independence as a boon doubly\r\ngrateful in the person of a sovereign representing their old and\r\nloved dynasty, whose opening character promised no unworthy successor\r\nto his esteemed uncle and father. During some days the Duke attended\r\nto various demands and representations of the commissioners, and, by\r\nwell-timed favours to their different cities, quickly established\r\nhimself in the good graces of his new subjects. The Duchess Regent\r\nproved a kind and prudent counsellor until he came of age, and long\r\ncontinued her assistance in his affairs of state, residing at his\r\ncourt while he had a home to share with her. The great discretion\r\nand good feeling he now manifested towards her, and the scrupulous\r\nanxiety he testified to retain around him all Guidobaldo's tried\r\nfriends and servants, quickly ripened the popularity which his\r\nfortunate position had sown, and which eventually enabled him\r\nto recover and maintain his sovereignty in circumstances nearly\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nDETAIL OF THE URBINO VENUS\r\n\r\n_Supposed portrait of Duchess Leonora, from the picture by Titian in\r\nthe Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nThe restless spirit of Julius fretted against the resistance still\r\noffered by the Venetians to his incorporating with the papal states\r\nthose places in Romagna which they had seized, upon the fall of\r\nValentino, nor would he accept the compromise which they proposed,\r\nof surrendering Rimini, on receiving from him a formal investiture\r\nof Faenza. They were also suspected of irritating by their intrigues\r\nthe feverish state of that district, and of undermining the\r\npreponderating influence which it was his policy there to establish.\r\nOn pretext of crowning Maximilian, whose title to the imperial\r\ndignity had not been completed by that formality, the Pontiff invited\r\nhim to march into Italy, and support his views. The Emperor, in\r\naccepting the proposal, demanded free passage through the Venetian\r\nterritories, with a threat of forcing his way, if obstructed.\r\nAssured of support from their ally of France, the Signory offered\r\ncompliance, on condition of his going unarmed: but, spurning such\r\nterms, he, in February, moved with an army upon the valley of Trent.\r\nHe was, however, effectually held in check by the Venetian generals,\r\nNicolò da Petigliano and Bartolomeo d'Alviano; whilst Louis, besides\r\nsending Gian Giacomo Trivulzio to their support, instigated the Duke\r\nof Gueldres to carry fire and sword into Lower Germany. Maximilian,\r\nfinding his hands full, made a hasty truce with the Venetians in\r\nMay, and turned to punish Gueldres. The Venetian and French armies\r\nbeing thereupon disbanded, the moment seemed to Julius favourable\r\nfor renewing his designs upon Romagna, and in the following November\r\nhe sent the Cardinal of Sta. Croce to take part in negotiations,\r\nwhich had been opened at Cambray, for reconciliation of the Emperor\r\nand the French monarch. Maximilian readily lent himself to any\r\nmeasures calculated to efface his recent disgrace in the Alpine\r\nvalleys, and to recover some places in Friuli which had remained\r\nin the enemy's hands; Louis was induced to accede, in order to\r\nwrest from Venice such portions of the old Visconti duchy as owned\r\nher sway; and Ferdinand joined the coalition in hopes of regaining\r\nseveral Neapolitan sea-ports, over which the Lion of St. Mark still\r\nwaved in security of certain advances by the Republic for the wars\r\nof Lower Italy. Out of these elements there was concluded, on the\r\n10th of December, a famous treaty, which denounced the Venetians as\r\nambitious perturbators of Italy and all Christian lands, and declared\r\nwar against them as the common enemies of the allies, who pledged\r\nthemselves to take the field before April, for recovery of Ravenna,\r\nCervia, Rimini, and Faenza to the Holy See, and of the territories\r\nrespectively claimed by the other contracting powers in Austria,\r\nLombardy, and Calabria. A subsidiary article took Francesco Maria\r\nunder their special protection, and guaranteed his states; whilst\r\nby another the Duke of Ferrara was left free to become a party, on\r\npayment to the Emperor of a sum of money in dispute between them.\r\nSuch was the notable League of Cambray, misnamed holy, on the vague\r\npretext that the maritime Republic, by retaining Ravenna and Cervia,\r\nimpeded the pacification of Christendom, and a general armament\r\nagainst the Turks. Not only was it an innovation upon the established\r\ncustom of pitting the German and French interests against each\r\nother, and settling their differences on the blood-stained plains\r\nof Lombardy, but, as the first great coalition of European powers\r\nfor one common political object, it may be regarded as founding the\r\nmodern system of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nYet, though this formidable confederation was the child of his\r\nown brain, matured by the address of his legate, Julius shrank\r\nbefore the Promethean monster, and paused ere he animated it by his\r\nratification. Well might it startle him to find that his labours\r\nfor the ulterior emancipation of Italy from foreign yoke were\r\nabout to divide one of her finest states among her most formidable\r\nultramontane foes. Had Duke Guidobaldo been spared a little longer,\r\nhis cool head and pacific disposition, as well as his friendship for\r\nthe Signory and his influence with the Pope, might have counteracted\r\nthe unnatural combination; but the die was cast, and the Pontiff had\r\nonly to await the course of events for an opportunity of undoing his\r\npresent work.[*235]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *235: The league of Cambrai is one of the great crimes of\r\nhistory. The man who devised it and urged it upon Europe was the\r\nhead of European Christianity, Pope Julius II. Beside this, the\r\nsensualities and murders of the Borgia go for nothing. His policy,\r\ncreated by hate, succeeded in so far as it established the States of\r\nthe Church and murdered Italy. Yet looking back now, we may judge\r\nof the price that has been required of the Church for that treason.\r\nBeggared of her possessions, at the mercy of the new Italian kingdom,\r\nhe who sits in the seat of Julius is a prisoner in the Vatican--the\r\nprisoner of history.]\r\n\r\nUnable to hold a military command, which would have better suited\r\nhis talents and tastes than the duties of Christ's vicegerent upon\r\nearth, Julius gratified his family predilections by appointing his\r\nnephew Francesco Maria to be captain-general of the ecclesiastical\r\ntroops. His investiture took place in the church of S. Petronio, at\r\nBologna, on the 4th of October, 1508, when he received the pontifical\r\nbaton from the Cardinal of Pavia, a prelate whose destiny we shall\r\nfind, ere long, fatally bound up in his own. But the time for active\r\nservice not being yet arrived, he contented himself with a review\r\nof the forces thus placed under his charge. Being considered equal\r\nto such a command, it is not surprising he should think it time to\r\ncelebrate his long-projected nuptials.[*236] On the 5th of November,\r\nJulius wrote to the Duchess Elisabetta, to send a _lettiga_ or\r\nlitter, with three horses, in order to bring his bride on a visit to\r\nUrbino, where the ceremony took place on Christmas Eve, 1508.[*237]\r\nThe letters, addressed to Federigo Fregoso by Bembo, who arrived on\r\nthe 19th, unveil some proofs of the bridegroom's felicity which it\r\nwere more decorous to pass over; but its revelations throw light\r\nupon the contrasted feelings of the still mourning court. \"Our\r\nreception was truly chilling: no joy or hilarity in the palace; even\r\nin the city its wonted aspect; our happy youth himself quite frigid;\r\nbut there is hope that he will become more ardent....\" Writing a\r\nweek after the marriage, he says that as soon as it was over, the\r\nDuke manifested the most unbounded affection, which became daily\r\nmore passionate; and declares that he had never met with a more\r\ncomely, merry, or sweet girl, who, to a most amiable disposition,\r\nadded a surprisingly precocious judgment, which gained for her\r\ngeneral admiration.[238] This event was hailed at Urbino with great\r\npublic rejoicings and sumptuous fêtes, and the triumphal arches,\r\ntheatres, and other architectural and pictorial works required for\r\nthe occasion, were executed under the direction of Timoteo Vite and\r\nGirolamo Genga. In 1843 I saw, in the hands of Padre Cellani, at\r\nthe Augustine convent in Pesaro, an interesting memorial of this\r\nmarriage. It is a small MS. psalter, with a frontispiece illuminated\r\nin the manner of the Veronese limners, representing Nathan rebuking\r\nDavid, whose crown and sceptre are fallen to the ground--a singular\r\ntheme for a bridal present, which, from the legend \"LIONOR GOZAGA\r\nURBINI DUCISSA,\" with the impaled arms of the two families,\r\nit may have been. The Lady Leonora was about his own age, and,\r\nalthough neither her beauty nor accomplishments have met with the\r\nsame celebration as those of her aunt the Duchess Elisabetta, we\r\nshall have ample opportunity of observing in her character much\r\nenergy and good sense, with undeviating affection to her husband;\r\nwhilst the pencil of Titian has preserved to us a person which in a\r\nsovereign must have been lauded as handsome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *236: On the 25th of August, Francesco Maria had paid a\r\nvisit to Mantua to see his betrothed. \"Come,\" said Leonora's uncle\r\nto him, \"and when you have seen Madonna Leonora and the Marchese's\r\nhorses you will have seen the two finest things in the world.\"\r\nFrancesco Maria spent two days there travelling incognito with but\r\nfour persons. Cf. JULIA CARTWRIGHT, _op. cit._, vol. I., p.\r\n310. An amusing letter from Federico Cattaneo to Isabella d'Este, who\r\nwas absent, describes the meeting of Francesco Maria and his future\r\nbride. Leonora was fourteen, and they were married at Christmas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *237: Cf. LUZIO E RENIER, _op. cit._; p. 195, for\r\nthe entry of the Duchess into Urbino.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: It is difficult to reconcile with these details of an\r\neye-witness the statement of Leoni, followed by Riposati and others,\r\nthat the marriage was privately performed at Mantua in February,\r\n1509. In May of that year the Duke was unanimously chosen a Knight\r\nof the Garter at a chapter of that order, but for reasons which it\r\nis now too late to investigate, the nomination was not confirmed by\r\nHenry VIII. At next election he had but one vote out of ten, and his\r\nname does not again occur in the record preserved by Anstis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Franz Hanfstaengl_\r\n\r\nTHE GIRL IN THE FUR-CLOAK\r\n\r\n_Possibly a portrait of Duchess Leonora of Urbino. After the picture\r\nby Titian in the Imperial Gallery, Vienna_]\r\n\r\nFrom his honeymoon happiness the boy-bridegroom was speedily summoned\r\nto the field. After issuing a preparatory apostolic admonition to\r\nthe Signory, on the 27th of April, 1509, Julius ordered his nephew\r\nto assume offensive operations against Romagna, supported by the\r\nBaglioni, Vitelli, and other vassals of the Church. The Duke was\r\nalready on foot, and after some skirmishes before Rimini, he attacked\r\nBrisghella on the 4th of May; the place speedily surrendering, he\r\noccupied himself in saving its inhabitants, so far as possible,\r\nfrom the miseries of a sack, which Muratori denounces as worthy of\r\nthe Turks, and which Roscoe unwarrantably imputes to him as an act\r\nof wanton cruelty. Following up this success, he, with youthful\r\nenthusiasm, adopted various expedients for harassing the enemy, but\r\nobtained still more credit for the judgment displayed in a singular\r\ndilemma, which might have disconcerted a more experienced commander.\r\n\r\nThere existed between some bands of Spanish and Italian soldiery\r\nin his camp, various heart-burnings ready to kindle at a spark.\r\nRamocciotto, an Italian captain, having been sent upon secret duty,\r\nas evening approached his men were seized with a vague impression\r\nthat he had met with foul play from the Spaniards. Just then, during\r\na wrangle among some camp-followers about a baggage-mule, one of them\r\ncalled out in stentorian voice, \"_Taglia! taglia!_\" meaning that\r\nthe packing-cords should be cut. These words, which rang through\r\nthe stilly air, were mistaken for \"_Italia! Italia!_\" and were\r\ncaught up by the feverish followers of Ramocciotto as a watchword,\r\nwhich they loudly echoed, and rushed to arms. Their cry and action\r\nwere repeated by most of the troops, who had just finished their\r\nevening meal, and in a moment the camp was a scene of inexplicable\r\nconfusion, the fury of some and the consternation of others combining\r\nto produce a general panic. Francesco Maria and his officers were\r\ntaken by surprise, but with great presence of mind he ordered an\r\nadvance upon Faenza as the readiest means of restoring order. The\r\ngloom of twilight now settled down upon the camp, augmenting the\r\nembarrassment, and ere the troops evacuated it, a good many Spaniards\r\nhad been cut down in the _mêlée_. Military discipline at length\r\nprevailed, and the Duke, finding the town on its guard, returned to\r\nquarters. Ramocciotto's reappearance appeased the originators of the\r\ntumult, but it was not till next day that a stern inquiry detected\r\nits casual origin. Thus did the promptitude and prudence of the\r\njuvenile general save his character from compromise, and his little\r\narmy from disaster.[239]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 489. This is but a fragment of the\r\nlife of Francesco Maria by Urbano Urbani, who was his secretary at\r\nthis time. Our account of the League of Cambray has been taken from\r\nit, collated with many published authorities. Urbani's full work,\r\nwhich I have not discovered, has been largely drawn upon by Leoni,\r\nBaldi, and other biographers.]\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical army consisted of eight thousand infantry and\r\none thousand six hundred horse, a force by no means adequate for\r\nthe service it was called upon to perform. The Pontiff, with fatal\r\npartiality, had entrusted the entire control of the commissariat and\r\nstores for the campaign to the Cardinal of Pavia, of whom the remark\r\npassed into a proverb, that whoever would make up a jerkin of every\r\ncolour should employ the words and actions of the Legate of Bologna.\r\nFrancesco Alidosio was second son of the Lord of Castel del Rio, an\r\ninconsiderable mountain fief adjoining the state of Imola, which\r\nlatter, after being long held in sovereignty by his family, had been\r\nbought or wrested from his grandfather by Sixtus IV. and the Sforza.\r\nHaving been educated for the Church, he attached himself on the death\r\nof that Pontiff to Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, whose entire\r\nfavour and confidence he won, not only by long personal service,\r\nbut by firmly withstanding various offers made him by the Borgia to\r\ndispose of his master by poison. As soon as his patron was placed\r\nin the chair of St. Peter, his services were rewarded by a scarlet\r\nhat, followed by the see of Pavia, the rich office of Datario, and\r\nother valuable preferments. But his character had been regarded as so\r\nquestionable, in the scandalous pontificate of Alexander, that many\r\nobjections were raised in the consistory to his promotion, and even\r\nthe silver-tongued Jovius attributes his rapid advancement to the\r\nadvantages of a fine person and an unscrupulous pliancy of principle.\r\nThe influence he had obtained over the open-hearted Julius was\r\nmaintained by his facility in accommodating himself to the outbreaks\r\nof his patron's impetuous temper; and it entirely blinded the Pope to\r\nthe danger of reposing implicit confidence in such a counsellor. But\r\nthe Cardinal, not satisfied to share these favours with another, did\r\nall in his power to obtain an undivided mastery over his affections,\r\nand especially to supplant his nephew in his regards. The means which\r\nhe adopted to effect this were, as we shall soon see, to thwart all\r\nthe Duke's plans, and throw upon him the blame of their failure. But\r\nthe mainspring of his hopes and intrigues was the restoration of\r\nImola to himself or his brother; and as the policy of Julius rendered\r\nhim deaf to such a request, even from a favourite, the latter\r\nscrupled not to purchase his object from the French, by betraying to\r\nthem those interests with which as legate of Bologna he was entrusted.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria accordingly found his movements hampered at every\r\nturn by the scarcity of supplies, and, in answer to unceasing\r\nremonstrances, had from the Legate abundance of fair words and\r\nsounding promises leading to no result whatever. This was the more\r\nprovoking, as sound policy required a speedy conclusion to operations\r\ncarried on in a province that, though in hostile hands for the time,\r\nwas eventually destined to remain under the papal sway, towards which\r\nit was therefore of importance to conciliate the population, rather\r\nthan to oppress them by military exactions. Notwithstanding these\r\ndifficulties, the Duke reduced the castles of Granaruolo and Roscio,\r\nFaenza surrendered, and the siege of Ravenna seemed approaching a\r\nfavourable conclusion, when the Venetians, panic-stricken by the\r\nFrench successes in Lombardy, and especially by the rout they had\r\nsustained on the 14th of May, at Vaila in the Ghiaradadda, sued for\r\npeace. They hoped, by offering to the Pope, the Emperor, and the\r\nSpaniard, all the places occupied on their respective territories,\r\nto conciliate these powers, and so be enabled to maintain themselves\r\nagainst French aggression. Their envoy addressed himself to arrange\r\nwith the Legate a suspension of arms, whilst he should forward to the\r\nPope a formal renunciation of the disputed towns in Romagna; but the\r\nwily Cardinal, who, whether from inherent dishonesty, or with some\r\nselfish end in view, seems to have acted with invariable bad faith,\r\nurged him to resign these places directly into his own hands, and,\r\nwhen the agent persisted in adhering to his instructions, he was\r\nthrown into irons and threatened with a halter. Nor was this the only\r\nmanifest instance of the Legate's treachery; for besides thwarting\r\nthe Duke on every occasion, and keeping him in the dark as to most\r\nimportant arrangements, he sent some of his own adherents to attack\r\nand pillage the garrison of Faenza, as it quitted the city upon a\r\ncapitulation accorded by himself. Francesco Maria, disgusted with\r\nhis duplicity, of his own authority liberated the envoy, and so was\r\nbrought into angry collision with the Cardinal, thus aggravating a\r\nquarrel ere long to end in blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brogi_\r\n\r\nDUCHESS OF URBINO, EITHER ELEONORA OR GIULIA VARANA\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Titian in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the youthful commander were increased by the\r\ninopportune arrival of four thousand Swiss mercenaries, who, finding\r\nmatters in train for a pacification which would dash their hopes of\r\nbooty, could scarcely be restrained from an immediate assault upon\r\nRavenna. Their ruffianly intentions being insidiously encouraged by\r\nthe Legate, it was only by great prudence and decision that the Duke\r\nprevented them from sacking that city, when evacuated on honourable\r\nterms by the Venetian authorities. This conciliatory policy was\r\nrewarded by a speedy surrender of Cervia, followed on the 11th of\r\nJune by that of Rimini, the last of the towns claimed by Julius,\r\nupon which Francesco Maria lost no time in disbanding his army and\r\nreturning home. As soon as he was gone, the Cardinal, steady only to\r\nhis duplicity, imprisoned the Venetian officers who had imprudently\r\nlingered within his reach. Although this campaign lasted but six\r\nweeks, and produced no considerable engagement, it afforded to the\r\nyoung Duke an insight into mankind, as well as a lesson in military\r\naffairs, which enabled him to pass at once from boyhood to the\r\nexperience, as well as the reputation, of an able commander.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Francesco Maria was liberated from camp duties, he sent\r\nto Mantua for his bride, and at his uncle's desire carried her to\r\nvisit Rome. The Roman citizens, ever devoted to festivity, received\r\nhim with distinction, due not less to his personal merit than to\r\nhis high rank and near relationship to the Pope. Among the pageants\r\nexhibited in honour of his marriage were tilting in the Piazza\r\nNavona, and a masque celebrating his successes in Romagna, after the\r\nmanner of those triumphs which that capital used to witness some\r\nfifteen centuries before. He carried Giuliano de' Medici with him to\r\nthe papal court, and effected his reconciliation with Julius, who,\r\nsuspecting him of some intrigues at Bologna, had given orders for his\r\nimprisonment; thus swelling that debt of the Medici to his family,\r\nwhich Leo X. subsequently and most ungratefully expunged.\r\n\r\nThe Duke also used his influence for removal of the interdict from\r\nVenice, the tried ally of his house; and this the Pontiff more\r\nreadily granted, having now gained all he hoped from the compact of\r\nCambray, and being ready for any new coalition that might tend either\r\nto aggrandise the Holy See or to liberate Italy from foreign yoke.\r\nHe therefore cared not for the remonstrances of his late coadjutors\r\nagainst his abrupt secession from their common policy; and, aware\r\nhow little signified Maximilian's languid operations, he only sought\r\nan apology for putting himself in direct opposition to the French,\r\nwhose successes in Lombardy were assuming a serious aspect. This was\r\nsoon afforded by the hollow counsels of the Cardinal of Pavia, whom\r\nhe had despatched to the camp of Louis on pretence of congratulating\r\nhim upon his victory at Vaila, but in fact to watch his intentions.\r\nIn this monarch the Legate found one as ambitious as his master, and\r\nnot more scrupulous than himself; he therefore with characteristic\r\ntreason encouraged the projects he had shrewdly penetrated,\r\nstipulating in return for the sovereignty of Imola, as soon as\r\nLouis should, by his secret aid, add Bologna and Romagna to his\r\nMilanese possessions. As an underplot in this drama of ingratitude\r\nand treachery, the Cardinal of Rouen proposed that Julius should be\r\ndeposed by a general council, with a view to securing for himself the\r\ntiara. Such at least were the ends which the French King soon after\r\nopenly pursued; and those historians who seek to establish a case\r\nagainst the Cardinal of Pavia, explanatory of his subsequent conduct,\r\ncharge him with thus early selling himself to Louis, and betraying\r\nhis partial and confiding patron the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe Legate, therefore, on his return to Rome, warmly seconded the\r\nPontiff's views. A rupture with France was the preliminary move in\r\nthe game he had arranged with Louis, and his zeal in promoting it\r\nseemed the surest disguise of his ulterior designs. Florence and\r\nFerrara were bound to the French interests, while Venice was their\r\ndetermined foe; so it only remained for the Pope to join stakes with\r\nthe Signory, and the party was made up. His intrigues to secure the\r\nsupport of Spain, Austria, and England, and to retain the Swiss in\r\nhis service, do not require our particular notice.\r\n\r\nUnwarned by recent events in Romagna, and blinded by affection for\r\nhis nephew, and for the Cardinal of Pavia, to the character of the\r\nlatter, and to the insuperable antipathy which had grown up between\r\nthem, the Pope, unfortunately, again delegated to them the joint\r\nconduct of the war. The first advance was made against Ferrara,\r\nwith the view, doubtless, of restoring the Polesine to Venice, and\r\nextending the temporal sway of the Keys to the banks of the Po.\r\nFrancesco Maria, who, after wintering in Rome, had returned home\r\nwith his Duchess in May, entered the Ferrarese ere July was over,\r\nat the head of six thousand infantry, and one thousand five hundred\r\nhorse, and quickly became master of a great part of that duchy. But\r\nthis army was unequal to operations against the city of Ferrara,\r\nstrong in its surrounding marshes; and an expected contingent of\r\nten thousand Swiss were intercepted by Chaumont, the French general\r\n(called Ciamonte by Guicciardini,) and sent back to their mountains\r\nby the combined means of force and gold. The naval armament against\r\nGenoa, then in the hands of Louis, proving also a failure, and the\r\nCardinal Legate conducting his department as unsatisfactorily as\r\nbefore, the Duke of Urbino heard with joy that the Pontiff was on\r\nhis way to the scene of operations. On the 15th of September he\r\npassed through Pesaro, leaving the Apostolic benediction, and various\r\nindulgences, in acknowledgment of his enthusiastic reception. When\r\nhe reached Bologna, he found Modena, which had lately surrendered to\r\nhis army, threatened by Chaumont in person, and a strong feeling\r\nabroad among the ecclesiastical officers, that they had been deluded\r\nby the Legate, who prevented them from clenching their success by the\r\ncapture of Reggio, and had wiled them to a fruitless demonstration\r\nbefore Ferrara, thereby not only wasting precious time, but exposing\r\nthe army to great hazard, and leaving Modena and Bologna uncovered.\r\nThe Pope immediately directed his nephew to send the Cardinal, under\r\narrest, to Bologna, which he did, with every mark of consideration;\r\nbut the extraordinary influence which that sneaking spirit exercised\r\nover the frank and open-hearted Julius, diverted his suspicions, and\r\nwas rewarded with new favours.\r\n\r\nThe unpromising aspect of his affairs, which brought the Pontiff in\r\nperson to Bologna, did not improve. Disappointed of the assistance\r\nhe looked for from Switzerland and Naples, feebly supported by his\r\nallies of Venice and Mantua, his troops were reduced to a defensive\r\nposition, fatal to the prestige which had attended their first\r\nsuccesses. Encouraged by this state of matters, and by the approach\r\nof Chaumont's powerful army, the friends of the exiled Bentivoglii\r\nbegan to agitate for their restoration to the sovereignty of Bologna.\r\nNor were these the worst mortifications awaiting the proud spirit\r\nof Julius. The clergy of France had met at Lyons, and decided upon\r\nconvoking a general council at Pisa, to sit in judgment upon his\r\nconduct, a movement already openly supported by Louis, the Emperor,\r\nand Florence, and by five members of the Sacred College. These\r\nanxieties fretted his fractious temperament into an illness, so\r\nserious at his advanced age, as to threaten a fatal termination;\r\nand in the prospect of thus losing the mainspring of the war, his\r\nconfederates were little inclined to compromise themselves by fresh\r\nexertions. His courtiers, too, alarmed at the prospect of clinging to\r\na falling cause, beset him with persuasions to obtain a truce on any\r\nterms. But they mistook the character with whom they had to deal.\r\nIn deference to their representations, he opened a negotiation with\r\nthe French general, wherein, far from assuming a suppliant air, he\r\nprescribed as a preliminary stipulation, the sacrifice of the Duke of\r\nFerrara to his vengeance, as a rebellious vassal. Thus passing\r\n\r\n     \"Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace\r\n     Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war,\"\r\n\r\nhe sent a summary threat to his Venetian allies, and to the Marquis\r\nof Mantua, that unless their promised contingents instantly marched\r\nto his support, he would arrange matters with the French King for\r\ntheir extermination.\r\n\r\nThe moral influence of this indomitable courage retrieved his\r\naffairs. The Venetian, Mantuan, and Neapolitan succours successfully\r\nand quickly arrived; many small free companies flocked to his\r\nstandard; and the Bolognese factions postponed their movement till a\r\nfitter moment. Breaking off all negotiations, he thundered censures\r\nagainst Chaumont and the Duke of Ferrara, and ordered his now ample\r\narmy to assume offensive operations. His physical energy was at the\r\nsame time restored, and the threatened eclipse proved but a passing\r\ncloud, from which his indomitable genius burst forth with renewed\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n     The Duke routed at Bologna from the Cardinal of Pavia's\r\n     treason, whom he assassinates--He is prosecuted, but\r\n     finally absolved and reconciled to the Pope--He reduces\r\n     Bologna--Is invested with Pesaro--Death of Julius II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December the Duke of Urbino returned the challenge to a general\r\nengagement, which Chaumont had boastfully given him a few months\r\nbefore, and, after carrying some places of minor importance, encamped\r\nbefore Mirandola. To the surprise and no small scandal of all, the\r\nPontiff, scarcely recovered from a dangerous malady, and braving\r\nthe unusual rigours of the season, repaired to head-quarters. In\r\nreply to representations of his advisers against a step hazardous\r\nto his health, and unusual, if not unbecoming, in the head of the\r\nChristian Church, he urged the necessity of vigorously, and at any\r\npersonal risks, meeting the disgraceful and schismatic proposal for\r\na council at Pisa,[*240] by proving himself both able and willing to\r\nperform the duties of his high office, in wielding its temporal and\r\nspiritual arms against all enemies and perturbators of the Church,\r\nas well as in maintaining its doctrines, and supporting its friends.\r\nThis ill-judged decision is said to have been strongly prompted by\r\nhis evil genius the Cardinal of Pavia, who, speculating upon the\r\nchance of its cutting short his master's life, made sure of, at all\r\nevents, turning to the advantage of his French friends the command\r\nat Bologna, which upon the Pope's departure would once more devolve\r\nupon him as legate. Guicciardini further charges him with promoting\r\nthe bootless demonstration against Mirandola, in order to divert the\r\narmy from Ferrara, whose inadequate defences might have rendered it\r\nan easy as well as important conquest. In the first days of the year,\r\nJulius reached the camp, attended by three cardinals, and took up\r\nhis quarters in a cottage exposed to the fire of the walls. It is\r\nstated in an old chronicle, that a cannon ball having fallen close\r\nto his pavilion, the enraged Pontiff ordered it to be sent to Loreto\r\nas an _ex voto_ offering, and threatened to deliver over the place\r\nto a sack. Severe cold and deep snow in nowise daunted him, and his\r\npresence alarming the garrison, whilst the besiegers were stimulated\r\nto exertion by his persuasions, the town was soon reduced, but, by\r\nextraordinary exertions on the part of Francesco Maria, was saved\r\nfrom pillage.[*241] Its garrison had been commanded by a natural\r\ndaughter of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio,[*242] who, on being rudely asked\r\nby the Legate, in presence of Julius, if she were the woman who would\r\nhold the place against the Pontiff, replied, \"Against you I could\r\neasily have defended it, but not against him.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *240: Little is known of the steps which led to the Council\r\nof Pisa. See some interesting letters printed in CREIGHTON,\r\n_op. cit._, vol. V., p. 329 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *241: Cf. SANUTO, _Diario_, vol. XI., p. 721 _et\r\nseq._ It was the Pope who threatened pillage. CREIGHTON,\r\n_op. cit._, vol. V., p. 143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *242: She was the widow of the Count Ludovico of Mirandola.]\r\n\r\nJulius, satisfied with this success, retired to Ravenna: whilst his\r\nnephew, who about this time was warned by the Doge of Venice of a\r\nplan concerted by the Cardinal of Rouen for poisoning him, led the\r\narmy towards Ferrara. As the best means of relieving that town,\r\nand perhaps in concert with the treacherous Legate, Trivulzio, who\r\nsince Chaumont's death, commanded the French troops, amounting to\r\nfifteen thousand lances, and seven thousand infantry, now marched\r\nupon Bologna, avoiding a battle, which the Duke of Urbino would\r\ngladly have hazarded. The latter, however, by forced marches arrived\r\nthere before him, and encamped at Casalecchio, three miles south\r\nof the city. The French army was by this time at Ponte Laino, about\r\nfive miles north-west from the gate; and the Duke lost no time in\r\nadvising the Legate of the position of affairs, offering to throw two\r\nor three thousand men and some artillery into Bologna. After losing\r\nmuch valuable time in consultation with some of the citizens, the\r\nCardinal declined these as unnecessary. This answer appears to have\r\nconverted into certainty the suspicions which Francesco Maria had\r\nlong entertained of his coadjutor's good faith. He knew the garrison,\r\nconsisting of about twelve hundred troops, to be utterly inadequate\r\nto resist the French; he was also aware that the exiled Bentivoglii,\r\nthen hovering about at the head of a strong band of adherents, were\r\neagerly looked for by their numerous partisans within the walls, to\r\nwhom the Cardinal had rendered his ecclesiastical authority doubly\r\nodious, by a series of oppressive measures totally inconsistent with\r\nits usual mild sway, and intended, no doubt, to promote his own\r\ntreasonable ends, by alienating the inhabitants from the established\r\norder of things. Strongly impressed with the urgency of the crisis,\r\nthe young Duke persisted in his intention of reinforcing the\r\ngarrison, but some older officers, persuaded by renewed assurances\r\nfrom the Cardinal, overruled him in council, and their march was\r\npostponed until morning,--a delay fatal to the cause, and pregnant\r\nwith complicated evils.\r\n\r\nSo little was the Duke of Urbino satisfied with this resolution,\r\nthat he posted videttes under the walls, and spent the night in\r\nreconnoitring with his staff. Midnight had just passed when a\r\nconfused murmur from the city attracted his attention. The word\r\n_Chiesa!_ or church, seeming to prevail amid the din, he had hope\r\nthat the Legate's authority was maintained; but presently the\r\nwatchword being heard more distinctly, it proved to be _Sega!\r\nSega!_ signifying \"The saw! the saw!\" a badge and war-cry of the\r\nBentivoglii. After some time lost in painful suspense, it was\r\nascertained from the sentinels that the French and the Bentivoglii\r\nwere masters of the place. Aware of his critical situation, but\r\nretaining his presence of mind, Francesco Maria gave instant orders\r\nfor a retreat, fixing a point of rendezvous five miles on the road\r\ntowards Romagna. Thither he marched his cavalry in perfect order,\r\nby the level country, and was followed by the Venetian and other\r\ninfantry along the high ground. The latter, being set upon at once\r\nby the enemy and the country people, fell into confusion, and, but\r\nfor the Duke's strenuous persuasions, and a successful charge which\r\nhe made with his cavalry upon their assailants, their officers\r\nwould have given way to a general panic, and the army must have\r\nbeen annihilated. The coolness of their juvenile commander so far\r\nreassured them that the retiring army encamped on the morrow between\r\nForlì and Cesena, without much further loss than their artillery\r\nand baggage.[243] The vast quantity of booty obtained for this\r\nmisconducted affair the nick-name of \"donkey-day.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: So say the Urbino writers. Guicciardini characterises\r\nthe escape of the army as a panic-rout, in which the whole\r\ncamp-equipage and colours, including the ducal standard, fell into\r\nthe enemy's hands. Sanuto says that 200 men-at-arms were slain.]\r\n\r\nBologna was lost on the night of the 21st of May, and, beyond all\r\nquestion, it fell from the Legate's fool-hardiness or treason. The\r\ncatastrophe which followed it called forth a bitterness of feeling\r\nfatal to impartial judgment, and the historians whom we have chiefly\r\nfollowed were friendly to the Duke of Urbino, and consequently\r\nprejudiced against the Cardinal.[244] Yet, after full allowance\r\nfor this circumstance, there seems no reasonable doubt that the\r\nlatter secretly favoured the French interests, and neutralised those\r\nmeasures by which Francesco Maria would have saved the city. He\r\nplaced the gates in charge of noted partisans of the exiled family,\r\nby whom they were opened after nightfall to receive the Bentivoglii,\r\nfollowed by the main body of the French army. It was even alleged\r\nthat he had previously sent away his most valuable effects; at all\r\nevents, he wanted courage to share the success which had crowned\r\nhis treason, and, in real or pretended panic, escaped upon a mule,\r\ndisguised in a lay habit, and attended by only two followers. Nothing\r\ncould palliate his flight without an attempt to warn the Duke of his\r\ndanger, or to concert measures for the preservation of his army; and\r\nhis whole behaviour lays him open to the suspicion of an intention\r\nto sacrifice both. Against such a combination of untoward events\r\nthe friends of the Church could not struggle, and the mass of the\r\nBolognese, smarting under recent oppression, welcomed their former\r\nrulers with joy, and vented their insensate fury in smashing the\r\nbronze statue of the Pope, which Michael Angelo had executed in the\r\nshort period of fifteen months, and which was afterwards cast into a\r\ncannon bearing the Pontiff's name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: Not only Leoni and Reposati, but the MSS. in the\r\nUrbino library, which refer to these transactions, must be so\r\nregarded. We have compared all of these, especially Baldi's life of\r\nthis Duke, and the defence of him against Guicciardini, which he\r\nleft prepared for the press in No. 906 of the Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 924\r\ncontains the pleading of the younger Beroaldo in favour of the Duke,\r\nwhen charged with the Cardinal of Pavia's murder. No. 1023, art. v.,\r\nand No. 819, fol. 335, the former by Monsignor Paolo Maria Bishop of\r\nCagli, the latter anonymous, have supplied us with some new facts.\r\nGuicciardini, admitting in other passages the Legate's bad faith and\r\nhis antipathy to Francesco Maria, blames his deficiency of courage or\r\njudgment in the Bologna affair, and lashes the aggravated vices of\r\nhis character. Roscoe has not here exercised his usual acumen.]\r\n\r\nFrom Castel del Rio, a petty fief which his family had retained\r\nafter losing the seigneury of Imola, the Cardinal on the 22nd sent\r\ncourier after courier to Julius at Ravenna, preoccupying his ears\r\nwith representations against his nephew, upon whose cowardice he cast\r\nthe whole blame of the recent disaster. The latter, having sought\r\nan audience of the Pope, found him alike prepossessed against him,\r\nand deaf to his self-justifications; indeed, his attempts to unmask\r\nthe traitor were denounced as suggestions of envy and malice, and\r\nhe was superseded in his command. A temper less forbearing might\r\nwell be incensed by this climax of injury, at the hands of one whose\r\nbad faith and malignity had long rankled in his fiery bosom. To\r\nsee his uncle at once sacrificed and cajoled, to be himself made\r\nthe scapegoat, while the true criminal was trusted and honoured,\r\nwere trials beyond endurance, even apart from the taunt by which\r\nthey were aggravated. As he quitted the presence-chamber, towering\r\nwith just indignation, and accompanied by two officers and as many\r\norderlies, he unluckily met the Legate on his mule, attended by a\r\nhundred light-horse. Regardless of his escort, the Duke rushed upon\r\nhim and plunged a poignard into his entrails, which passed through to\r\nhis saddle.[*245] The blow was repeated by the officers, his guard\r\nattempting neither redress nor vengeance, and in a few minutes the\r\nCardinal had gone to his dread account, exclaiming repeatedly in\r\nLatin, \"From crime comes mischief.\" This deplorable event happened\r\non the 24th of May.[246] Its details are variously stated, and one\r\naccount says that the rencontre occurred ere the Duke had seen\r\nhis Holiness, while the Legate was returning from an audience; on\r\nthe whole, we have preferred that of Giraldi, whose uncle was an\r\neye-witness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *245: The account of Paris de Granis (given by\r\nCREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., pp. 305-19) somewhat differs\r\nfrom that given here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: Several letters, quoted by Sanuto, MS. Diary, XII.,\r\n158-161, say the 23rd, being Saturday; but Saturday fell on the 24th.\r\nSee Filippo Giraldi, Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3153, f. 90.]\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria was quickly aware of the horror of this outrage,\r\nand immediately after arranging matters in the camp, retired to his\r\nstate, to repent, it is hoped, as well as to abide its results.[247]\r\nThe sacrilegious nature of the offence might indeed be palliated\r\nin the letter, by the lay dress which the Cardinal chanced to wear,\r\nbut his episcopal dignity and holy character as vicegerent of the\r\npapal authority were notorious, and the blind partiality of Julius\r\nseemed to have increased as his misconduct became more palpable. The\r\nsituation of that old man was indeed calculated to bend even his\r\nstern nature. He had committed an enterprise of doubtful policy, and\r\nagainst which a large portion of the Church was openly declared,\r\nto his most trusted friend and to his favourite nephew. The design\r\nhad utterly miscarried; Bologna, acquired by him so happily, was\r\nlost; a victorious enemy was within a few leagues of him; and his\r\nfriend had been murdered by his nephew, after mutual recriminations\r\nof treachery. The attendant cardinals and prelates, jealous of a\r\nmore favoured brother, exulted in the deed while condemning its\r\nmanner; but their master is described by Paris de Grassis as giving\r\nway to the most exaggerated demonstrations of excessive grief,\r\nrenouncing food and shutting himself out from converse. After hastily\r\nauthorising negotiations with Trivulzio, he set out for his capital\r\nin a litter. At Rimini he was startled by a formal citation to appear\r\nbefore the Council of Pisa, and passed through Pesaro on the 11th of\r\nJune. But on reaching Rome his spirit had rallied. On the 18th of\r\nJuly he summoned a general council at the Lateran, and declared that\r\nof Pisa schismatic and null; he thundered excommunications against\r\nLouis, the Florentines, and all its adherents; he deprived the\r\ncardinals who attended it; and declared war anew against France, as\r\nan enemy of the Church and of Italy. About the same time he suspended\r\nhis nephew from all his dignities, and summoned him to answer at\r\nRome for the assassination of the Cardinal of Pavia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: We obtain a curious glimpse of his home-circle at\r\nthis critical moment from the correspondence of Bembo, who, having\r\njust quitted Urbino on his way to Venice, wrote thus to Fregoso from\r\nCesena, where he was waiting a passage by sea. \"But what, I say,\r\nare you and your ladies, and the Duke, and the rest of you grandees\r\nabout? What is my Ippolita doing? Is she entangled in the toils of\r\nSecundio or Trivulzio? Oh dull and drivelling me, who, abandoning\r\nmy loves to the rapine and plunder of men of war, am here sitting\r\non a sandy shore more pluckless and besotted than the very shells!\r\nMany salutations in my name to both their Highnesses, and to Emilia,\r\nand the lively Margherita, and to Ippolita of many admirers, and to\r\nmy rival Alessandro Trivulzio.\" This badinage was surely ill-timed,\r\nwithin a month of the defeat of Francesco Maria and the Cardinal's\r\nassassination.]\r\n\r\nThe accounts we have of the proceedings against the Duke of Urbino\r\nupon this charge are somewhat contradictory. Baldi says that his\r\nimpetuous temper, ill-brooking the severity of one whom he was\r\nconscious of having honestly served, tempted him to throw off his\r\nuncle and seek an engagement under Louis; and the monitory issued\r\nagainst him by Leo X. in 1516 charges him with employing Count\r\nCastiglione on such a mission: but this foolish idea quickly passing,\r\nhe obeyed the citation. On his arrival, attended by Castiglione, he\r\nwas put under arrest, and obliged to give bail in 100,000 scudi to\r\nawait the sentence of a commission of enquiry, consisting of six\r\ncardinals, one of whom was Giovanni de' Medici, afterwards Leo X.\r\nThe process was long and complicated, for the Duke had many proofs,\r\noral and documentary, to adduce of the Legate's secret intelligence\r\nwith the French and the Bentivoglii. The pleading in his defence,\r\nby Filippo Beroaldo the younger, has already been referred to as in\r\nthe Vatican library, and is a very remarkable declamation. Instead\r\nof urging the hot blood of one-and-twenty in extenuation of a\r\nsudden outbreak of fury under strong provocation, it justifies the\r\nassassination as merited by the Cardinal's notorious and nefarious\r\ntreasons. Representing his life and morals in the darkest colours,\r\nit brands his boyhood as base; his puberty as passed in flagitious\r\nintercourse with bawds and gamblers; his youth as debauched by\r\nbribery, peculation and sacrilege; his mature age as degraded by\r\nthe sacrifice of friends, the plunder of provinces, the open sale\r\nof sacred offices. It charges him with having had the throats cut\r\nof four eminent citizens of Bologna, against whom no accusation was\r\nbrought, and leaving their bodies in the piazza; and further alleges\r\nthat, having heard of the beautiful daughter-in-law of one of these\r\nvictims, he sent for her to his presence, when his attendants,\r\nalarmed by fearful cries, broke open the doors and discovered him\r\nin the act of violating her person. After narrating his manifold\r\ntreacheries towards the Pontiff and the Duke, the advocate, far from\r\npalliating the homicide, boasts of it as a public service, and,\r\ndeclaring that Francesco Maria was an instrument in the Almighty's\r\nhand for the great and benevolent purpose of ridding mankind of\r\nsuch a monster, only laments, for the public weal, that the holy\r\ninspiration which dictated it had not been sooner vouchsafed to this\r\n\"liberator of the commonwealth.\" Lowering his tone, however, towards\r\nthe close of this inflated oration, he appeals to the judges to spare\r\na hero whose promise of future usefulness was precious to Italy,\r\nand in whose acquittal many princely personages were interested.\r\nThe fierce philippic of Beroaldo was reproduced under a poetic garb\r\nin the satirical ode of Giovio, which Roscoe has printed. Neither\r\nauthority can be deemed unprejudiced, but public feeling seems to\r\nhave confirmed these invectives, and even Guicciardini attempts not\r\nto answer for the Cardinal's good faith.\r\n\r\nWhilst this investigation was experiencing the law's delay, Julius\r\nwas attacked by a quartan ague of a dangerous character. With wonted\r\nwilfulness, he refused all proper nourishment, eating only fruit,\r\nuntil his constitution was nearly exhausted. A fainting fit having\r\noccasioned rumours of his death, tumults arose, but were vigorously\r\nsuppressed by the Duke of Urbino, who by a happy device got the\r\nCardinal of S. Giorgio to carry him the viaticum. The apparition by\r\nhis bedside of the person supposed likely to succeed him at once\r\nrecalled his energies, and induced him to adopt the most likely means\r\nof disappointing such expectations. He therefore no longer hesitated\r\nto eat an egg, into which two yolks had been introduced by the Duke's\r\norder, that he might take twice as much sustenance as he was aware\r\nof; and from that hour his strength rallied. A deep-rooted affection\r\nfor his nephew, rekindled by this double service, prompted him to a\r\nreconciliation, and in his first burst of gratitude he granted him\r\nabsolution for his crime, and sent him home with a donative of 12,000\r\nscudi. But as his Holiness had been induced to this reconciliation\r\nby personal favour, and perhaps by at length perceiving the Legate's\r\nfaithlessness, Francesco Maria declined availing himself of such an\r\nacquittal; and the process for murder, resumed at its own instance,\r\nhung over him until, on the 9th of December, a consistorial bull\r\nissued, fully absolving him of the charge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to return to the seat of war, whence this untoward incident\r\nhad removed the Duke of Urbino at a moment of peculiar interest.\r\nThe King of Spain having contributed a powerful contingent, the\r\nnew armament against Louis was placed under command of Raimondo\r\ndi Cardona, viceroy of Naples, with the Cardinal de' Medici as\r\nlegate. The Venetians, as before, were parties to this league, as\r\nwell as Henry VIII.; Florence, still in the hands of its republican\r\nfaction, and the now restored Bentivoglii, supported the French;\r\nwhilst Maximilian, though its nominal adherent, was as usual equally\r\ninefficient in war or peace. Romagna again became the destined scene\r\nof the new struggle, and there, as in Lombardy, its chances proved\r\nadverse to Louis. The Duke of Urbino, apparently from an unworthy\r\njealousy, refused to act under the Viceroy's command, but he gave\r\nfree passage to the army on its route through his state, supplying it\r\nwith provisions, and permitting his troops to march under its banner.\r\nHe even repaired to Fossombrone, to testify respect and hospitality\r\nto the general, but, suddenly taking alarm, and suspecting sinister\r\nintentions, he withdrew to Urbino in a somewhat ungracious manner.\r\nLight may be thrown upon these eccentric movements from the\r\ncorrespondence of Castiglione, by which it would seem that Julius,\r\nrelapsing into suspicion, had about this time spoken of his nephew\r\nas a traitor, who deserved to be quartered for maintaining, through\r\nCount Baldassare, a secret understanding with France and Ferrara;\r\nindeed, that he even diminished his company by sixty men-at-arms,\r\nand threatened to place the Duc de Termes over his head. It is not\r\nunlikely that, disgusted by this new insult, he may have intrigued\r\nwith the French party in a moment of weakness. At all events,\r\nso deeply was the Pope mortified, that, in an access of renewed\r\nirritation, he declared him rebel, and absolved his subjects from\r\ntheir allegiance. Francesco Maria was consequently absent from the\r\nbloody field of Ravenna, where his early friend the chivalrous Gaston\r\nde Foix met a heroic but premature death. The French army which he\r\ncommanded paid dearly, by his loss and that of their best troops,\r\nfor a nominal victory which eventually proved a ruinous reverse. It\r\nwas gained by the Duke of Ferrara's well-timed charge, and of forty\r\nthousand left dead in the field, above half had fought under the\r\nlilies of France. Indeed, but for the Viceroy's disgraceful flight,\r\nin a panic by some attributed to his suspicion of the Duke of Urbino,\r\nit might have been considered a drawn battle. So great was his terror\r\nthat he passed through Pesaro with but two attendants, leaving his\r\nSpaniards to regain the Neapolitan frontier as they might.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable engagement took place on Easter Day, the 11th of\r\nApril, but four days after the Pontiff had issued the bull against\r\nhis nephew.[*248] Notwithstanding this fresh provocation, the latter\r\nafforded every support to Cardona's troops, who,\r\n\r\n     \"Masterless, without a banner fled\";\r\n\r\nand, after placing his family out of harm's way, in S. Leo, hastened\r\nto Rome to console the Pope. But his Holiness was in no melting or\r\nwavering mood. With the brief remark, \"At all events, I have united\r\nour enemies,\" he quickly repaired the recent breach by recalling\r\nthe bull against Francesco Maria, and presented him with the baton\r\nof command. The Duke, remedying past misunderstandings by new\r\nexertions, hurried to Romagna to rally the broken battalions of the\r\nleague, and to raise fresh levies. Ere the French could recover\r\nfrom the paralysing effects of their dearly bought success, he had\r\nregained that country, and, on the 21st of June, took possession\r\nof Bologna without a blow. Following up his advantage, he mastered\r\nwith equal ease Modena, Parma, and Piacenza; but Reggio offered a\r\nresistance worthy of the heroic ages. It was held for the Duke of\r\nFerrara by Count Alessandro Ferrofino, who, having detected some of\r\nhis soldiers attempting to spike the guns, set them astride upon a\r\nmortar, and blew them into the air, assuring the bystanders that\r\nhe most willingly would serve his Holiness in the same way. When\r\necclesiastical censures were thundered against the garrison, he\r\nmade its chaplain return a pop-gun excommunication of the Pontiff.\r\nAfter two months had passed in this bootless struggle, Alfonso sent\r\nhis countersign to the commandant as an authority to surrender;\r\nbut, aware that his master was then at Rome, in the Pope's power,\r\nthe Count returned it, vowing that he would not yield till hunger\r\nhad driven him to eat off his right hand; adding, however, that, if\r\nhis Highness had a fancy to give away the fortress, he was ready to\r\nconsign it, with all its contents, by inventory, to whoever might\r\nbe commissioned to relieve him of the command. This proposal was\r\ncomplied with, and the indomitable captain marched out his little\r\ngarrison, with a safe conduct from the Pope whom he had defied.[249]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *248: The battle of Ravenna is fully described by\r\nGUICCIARDINI, _Opere Inedite_ (Firenze, 1857), vol. VI., p.\r\n36 _et seq._, in letters from his father and brother. The French had\r\neverything in their hands, the route was complete. They should have\r\npressed on to Rome and Naples, and have reduced the Pope to terms and\r\nannihilated the Spanish power in Italy. But Gaston was in his grave.\r\nCf. CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., p. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: Giraldi Dialogo, Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3153.]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, ever ready to abandon a falling cause, withdrew his\r\ncontingent from the French service, and acknowledged the authority\r\nof the Lateran council, which had been opened on the 3rd of May. The\r\nDuke of Ferrara, too, thought it full time to make his peace with the\r\nPope; while Louis, thus abandoned, could no longer maintain a footing\r\nin Italy, where but a few strongholds remained in his possession; and\r\nMilan was restored to Maximiliano Sforza, son of Ludovico il Moro.\r\nThe overtures of Alfonso were, however, unavailing, being met in no\r\ngenerous spirit by his ecclesiastical overlord. On proceeding to Rome\r\nto plead his own cause, he was called upon to surrender his fief to\r\nthe Holy See, and was treated as a prisoner. By the energetic aid\r\nof the Colonna chiefs, he escaped to his impenetrable swamps, and\r\nhastened to accredit Ariosto as his minister to appease the Pontiff,\r\na mission which totally failed, the poet's silver tongue having\r\nbarely obtained grace for himself as envoy of a rebel. Francesco\r\nMaria marched, by order of Julius, towards the Polesine, but malaria\r\nprevailing there after recent inundations, fever ravaged his army,\r\nand their leader averted the fate of his grandfather in these fens,\r\nby a timely retreat to his mountain air. We are gravely told by\r\nGiraldi that \"the house of Ferrara mysteriously bears the name of\r\nthe Deity\" [_Est_], an idea which their repeated escapes by similar\r\napparently special interpositions of Providence may have suggested.\r\n\r\nIt was during the Ferrarese expedition, and avowedly at the Pope's\r\nurgent desire, that the Medici were re-established at Florence by\r\nthe league. The Duke of Urbino's absence from that enterprise has\r\nbeen accounted for by Guicciardini and Giovio, as the result of\r\npersonal feeling against the Cardinal Giovanni, and as contrary\r\nto his uncle's instructions. This innuendo becomes important from\r\nbeing the first symptom of misunderstanding between the dynasties of\r\nUrbino and Florence, and as apparently the origin of Guicciardini's\r\nprepossessions against Francesco Maria, which, adopted by subsequent\r\nwriters, especially by Roscoe and Sismondi, have led to very general\r\nmisrepresentations of his after policy and motives. The whole\r\nintercourse of that Duke with the Medici, down to 1515, affords a\r\nvirtual contradiction of latent enmity at this juncture, and the\r\nspecial charge in question is inconsistent with the facts stated by\r\nLeoni, who avers that, had Francesco Maria not been then engaged in\r\noperations against Ferrara, he would gladly have accompanied the\r\ncombined forces to Florence, and that he actually connived at their\r\ncarrying with them a portion of his artillery, contrary to private\r\ninstructions from his Holiness, who, when the moment for action\r\narrived, is alleged to have favoured the independence of Florence,\r\nperhaps under some vague apprehension of eventual dangers from\r\nMedicean ambition.\r\n\r\nItaly, now freed from ultramontane oppressors, saw Milan restored\r\nto its native princes, and Florence again in the hands of her most\r\ninfluential family. Thus far had the favourite aims of Julius been\r\nattained; but, instead of hailing these events as the basis of a\r\ngeneral pacification befitting his advanced years, he fretted in the\r\nrecollection that Naples yet owned a foreign yoke, and that Louis was\r\nstill intent upon vindicating his title to a Cisalpine dominion. The\r\nconvulsive throes of a stranded leviathan were no unfit parallel to\r\nthe versatile efforts wherein the old man consumed his waning powers.\r\nBut, in the multifarious projects which agitated his yet elastic\r\nmind, the interests of his again favourite nephew were not forgotten.\r\nA brief of the 10th of January, 1513, granted to the latter plenary\r\nremission for all his undutiful errors against the Church, as a\r\nprelude to new favours, which must now be detailed.[250]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: The preceding account of the judicial process, and of\r\nthe Duke's conduct in regard to the campaign of Ravenna, has been\r\nchiefly taken from Baldi, as his narrative is more intelligible\r\nand consistent with the best historical authorities, than the\r\nindistinct and garbled statements of Leoni and Riposati, who gloss\r\nover such facts as they cannot satisfactorily clear up. Guicciardini\r\nasserts that Francesco Maria set his peasantry upon the troops of\r\nCardona as they fled through the duchy from the rout of Ravenna, a\r\nstatement more reconcileable with that author's prejudice than with\r\nprobability. The legal evidence of both the Duke's absolutions will\r\nbe found in No. V. of the Appendix, and Giraldi is our authority for\r\nsome minor details. We have purposely avoided mixing up with this\r\npersonal narrative the more general events of the French war. They\r\nare succinctly given by Roscoe, _Leo X._, ch. viii. and ix.]\r\n\r\nHis uncle had entertained a scheme of purchasing for him the vague\r\nrights over Siena which the Emperors had long, though ineffectually,\r\nasserted; but a more hopeful expedient for his aggrandisement\r\nopportunely presented itself. We have, in a former chapter, narrated\r\nthe circumstances under which Alessandro Sforza became invested\r\nwith Pesaro in 1445. His grandson Giovanni, the outraged husband\r\nof Lucrezia Borgia, died in 1510, leaving, by his second marriage,\r\nan only son Costanzo, about a year old. Galeazzo, natural brother\r\nof Giovanni, who was himself of illegitimate birth, governed the\r\nstate, as tutor of this nephew, until the child's death, in August,\r\n1512, and so entirely acquired the good will of the people, that\r\nthey proclaimed him their seigneur. The odious tyranny exercised by\r\nall petty princes of Italy is a fertile theme for dreamy poets and\r\nphilosophising liberals; but, whilst the relative oppression was much\r\nthe same under all forms of government in the Peninsula, personal\r\nsafety was perhaps best maintained in those least exposed to internal\r\nconvulsion. From such shocks the minor sovereignties were more exempt\r\nthan the republics, and the residence of a court was beneficial as\r\nwell as flattering to the community; hence the fall of an hereditary\r\ndynasty was, in almost every instance, lamented by its subjects.\r\nThese are not, indeed, necessarily the best judges of their own\r\nwelfare; yet their deliberate and repeated convictions, when free\r\nfrom the influence of demagogues, and tested by impartial history,\r\ncan hardly be remote from truth.\r\n\r\nThe investiture of Pesaro had legally lapsed by the young Costanzo's\r\ndeath, and although, in many instances, the assumption of similar\r\nrights by illegitimate claimants had been passively permitted by the\r\nChurch, Galeazzo would have gladly shrunk from a contest which the\r\navowed policy of the reigning Pope rendered inevitable and hopeless.\r\nTempted, however, by the unanimous support of the people, he assumed\r\non his own account the authority he till now had held in behalf of\r\nhis nephew. Julius instantly recalled the Duke of Urbino from Lugo,\r\nto commence operations for the reduction of Pesaro, with Cardinal\r\nSigismondo Gonzaga as legate. After a brief resistance, Galeazzo\r\nsurrendered the citadel, on the 30th of October, by a capitulation\r\nwhich insured him an annuity of 1000 scudi of gold, and the allodial\r\nholdings of his family. These he conveyed to the Duke for 20,000\r\nducats, including the Villa Imperiale, and on the 9th of November he\r\nquitted Pesaro, attended by nearly the whole population, who bewailed\r\nwith bitter tears the extinction of a dynasty to whom they were\r\nfondly attached. The melancholy procession accompanied their lord as\r\nfar as La Cattolica, from whence he retired to Milan, and there met a\r\nviolent death in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Legate remained at Pesaro to administer the government\r\nin behalf of the Holy See, and the Duke returned home. Julius had\r\nalready made one exception to his policy of bringing the minor fiefs\r\nunder direct sway of the Church, by renewing the investiture of\r\nUrbino in favour of his nephew, and the opportunity was too tempting\r\nfor repeating a measure recommended by the ties of natural affection.\r\nThe unmerited suspicions and hasty severity which he had manifested\r\ntowards Francesco Maria seemed to warrant some consideration; there\r\nwas also an arrear of about 10,000 scudi of pay and advances, by\r\nthe late and present Dukes, in the wars of the Church, which her\r\nexhausted treasury was unable to discharge, but for which it was\r\ndesirable to secure compensation ere the tiara should encircle a less\r\nfriendly brow.[251] Accordingly, one of the Pontiff's latest acts was\r\nto gain the consent of the consistory of his nephew's investiture in\r\nPesaro, to be held in vicariat for the annual payment of a silver\r\nvase, a pound in weight. The bull to this effect is dated the 16th\r\nof February, 1513, and on the 21st his busy spirit was at rest.\r\nThree weeks later, the Duke and Duchess of Urbino took possession of\r\nPesaro, and were flatteringly welcomed. Indeed, the people, finding\r\nthe fate of the Sforza sealed, appeared to have looked about for any\r\nmeans of emancipation from ecclesiastical rule; and, ere Galeazzo had\r\nquitted the capital, the council entertained a proposal to petition\r\nthe Sacred College in favour of Francesco Maria as his successor.\r\nThis step, whether suggested by Julius or not, greatly strengthened\r\nhis hands in carrying through the arrangement which he had at heart,\r\nand it enabled the citizens to receive their new lord with peculiarly\r\ngood grace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: Yet Julius was reported to have left in St. Angelo,\r\n400,000 ducats of gold, besides jewels, and no state debts. Vat. Urb.\r\nMSS., No. 1023, f. 297.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n     Election of Leo X.--His ambitious projects--Birth of Prince\r\n     Guidobaldo of Urbino--The Pontiff's designs upon that\r\n     state, which he gives to his nephew--The Duke retires to\r\n     Mantua.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke's influence, as head of the della Rovere family, was\r\nparamount in the conclave, composed as it was of relations, friends,\r\nand creatures of the late Pope in overwhelming majority. The election\r\nwas therefore to a great degree in his hands, and when it fell\r\nupon the Cardinal de' Medici, he rejoiced in the elevation of a\r\npersonal friend. He and his brother Giuliano, their nephew Lorenzo,\r\nand their cousin Giulio, afterwards Clement VII., had been welcome\r\nguests at Urbino, during their family's long exile from Florence.\r\nIndeed, we have noticed Giuliano as one of the most brilliant\r\nornaments of Guidobaldo's court, where he resided so long that the\r\napartment devoted to his use still bears his name in the palace. The\r\nrestoration of the Medici to supremacy in their native city had been\r\nthe doing of Julius; the choice of their cardinal as his successor\r\nwas the act of his nephew.[*252] Thus was the bond of friendship\r\nconfirmed by ties of gratitude. But from such fetters princes are\r\noften prone to assume an exemption, and Francesco Maria was destined\r\nto experience that they are not more binding upon pontiffs.[253]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *252: This is rather vague. We are not told what Francesco\r\nMaria did that justifies Dennistoun in saying that the election of\r\nLeo X. was his act. I can find no evidence of Francesco Maria's\r\npersonal influence in the conclave. If the election of Leo was an\r\narrangement, it was Cardinal Riario to whom it was due. The charge of\r\ningratitude therefore falls to the ground.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: To inaugurate the new pontificate, and mark the\r\ncontrast of Alexander and Julius with their successor,--its Maecenas,\r\nAgostino Chigi, erected a triumphal arch, inscribed,--\r\n\r\n     \"Olim habuit Cypris sua tempora; tempora Mavors\r\n     Olim habuit; sua nunc tempora Pallas habet.\"\r\n\r\n     Venus here reigned supreme, by Mars displaced;\r\n     Our happier age by Pallas' sway is graced.\r\n\r\nTo this doggerel there quickly appeared the rejoinder,--\r\n\r\n     \"Mars fuit, est Pallas, Cypria semper ero.\"\r\n\r\n     Once Mars, Minerva now, but Venus still.]\r\n\r\nLeo X. has been one of the most fortunate of men. His all but\r\nsovereign birth was still more distinguished by the merit of his\r\nfamily, to which history has done the amplest justice. His natural\r\ntalents and tastes were not only of a high order, but were perfectly\r\nadapted to the golden age in which he lived, and to the high career\r\nfor which he was destined. His rapid and premature advancement to\r\nthe first dignities of the Church stimulated instead of relaxing his\r\nmental discipline. He obtained the triple tiara at the unprecedented\r\nage of thirty-seven, and wore it during the brightest period of the\r\npapacy. Though cut short in the flower of manhood, he lived long\r\nenough to link his name with the most splendid era of modern history,\r\nand although his measures accelerated the crisis of the Reformation,\r\nhe died ere their seed had borne that dreaded fruit. In fine, his\r\neventful life has been celebrated by at least one biographer worthy\r\nof the theme. On the wide field which such a character opens we shall\r\nhave little opportunity to expatiate. Our narrative has to do with\r\nits darker shadows, and to hold up this Pontiff as the implacable\r\nfoe of a dynasty which had singular claims upon his favour and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Anderson_\r\n\r\nLEO X\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Raphael in the Pitti Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nThe general estimate of Julius and of his successor has been shrewdly\r\nconceived and tersely expressed by Sismondi. \"The projects of the\r\nformer had prospered beyond the ordinary calculations of policy;\r\nhis impetuosity, by surprising his enemies and throwing all their\r\nplans into confusion, had often availed him more than prudence\r\ncould have done; he had also extended the temporal possessions of\r\nthe Church beyond what any of his predecessors had effected. Yet he\r\nhad caused so many mischiefs, he had occasioned such vast bloodshed,\r\nhe had so swamped Italy with foreign armies, even while he pretended\r\nto rid her of the barbarians, that his death was hailed as a public\r\nblessing, and the cardinals responded to the feeling of Rome, Italy,\r\nand all Christendom in desiring that his successor should in no\r\nrespect resemble him. As he had been old, restless, impatient, and\r\npassionate, they sought to replace him with one less aged, and whose\r\ntastes were for literature, pleasure, and epicurean indulgences....\r\nLeo was quite the opposite of his predecessor; his temperament\r\nwas far less stern, irascible, or unforgiving. Towards intimate\r\nassociates his manners were singularly cheerful and gracious. The\r\nprotection he extended to letters and arts, the favours which he\r\nlavished upon savants, poets, and artists, drew from all Europe a\r\nchorus of commendation. But, on the other hand, his character fell\r\nvery short of that of Julius in frankness and elevation; all his\r\nnegotiations were stained by deceit and perfidy. Whilst he talked\r\nof peace he fanned the flame of war; no pity for the inhabitants of\r\nItaly, crushed by barbarian hosts, ever influenced his conduct. His\r\nambition, nowise inferior to that of his predecessor, was not veiled,\r\neven to himself, by motives equally respectable. His object was not\r\nthe independence of Italy, nor the aggrandisement of the Church, but\r\nthe advancement of his own family.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, second son of Lorenzo the\r\nMagnificent, was elected Pope on the 11th of March, 1513, and\r\nwas crowned on the 19th. The Duke of Urbino had repaired to Rome\r\nto offer his congratulations in person, and attended the solemn\r\ninstallation at the Lateran, with twenty-four mounted gentlemen\r\nand as many footmen; but mingling regard for the dead with respect\r\nfor the living, he and all his suite appeared in black velvet and\r\nsatin, as mourning for his uncle. The device worn on the Pontiff's\r\nliveries at this pageant, was in harmony with his previous character\r\nand present professions: under a golden \"yoke\" was inscribed the\r\nword _suave_, meaning something more winning than the scriptural\r\nphrase \"easy,\" from which it was borrowed. When two more years had\r\ngone by, Francesco Maria was an outlaw, crushed under that gentle\r\nyoke, and stripped of his all; whilst the Duke of Ferrara, the next\r\ngreat feudatory of the Church who followed in the procession, could\r\nscarcely maintain himself by French aid, until the death of his\r\npontifical oppressor enabled him to parody on his medals another\r\nand more appropriate text, in memory of his escape, \"Out of the\r\nLION'S mouth.\" At this coronation there was witnessed an\r\nunwonted spectacle, the fruit of Alexander's aggressions on the\r\nCampagna barons. The humbled chiefs of Colonna and Orsini walked side\r\nby side, and their reconciliation was commemorated by a rare medal,\r\non which the crowned column of Colonna is fondly hugged by the Orsini\r\nbear, with the motto, \"For their country's safety.\" Francesco Maria's\r\nreception was as cordial as distinguished, for the promptings of\r\nambition had not yet transformed Leo's naturally bland and gracious\r\nnature into unrelenting and bitter hate. He was accordingly confirmed\r\nin his dignities, and retained for a year as Captain-General of the\r\nChurch, with 13,844 ducats of pay, besides 30,000 of allowances for\r\nhis company of two hundred men-at-arms, and a hundred light cavalry;\r\nnor could words exceed the kindness of the letter in which Bembo\r\nintimated this to him on behalf of the Pope.[254]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: Papal brieves of Aug. 4 and April 17, 1513, in\r\nArchivio Diplomatico at Florence, and Bembo's public despatches, ii.\r\nNo. 8. Roscoe has no authority whatever for representing the Duke as\r\nat this period the Pope's \"formidable rival.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen the coronation fêtes were over, he returned home to enjoy one of\r\nthose brief intervals of repose which rarely fell to his lot. His\r\nalmost continual absence on military service had indeed been greatly\r\nfelt in his capital, and most of the distinguished men who frequented\r\nit under Duke Guidobaldo were now dispersed. Some of them, however,\r\nhad continued towards his nephew their friendship and services,\r\neither under his own banner or in diplomacy. Among these was\r\nBaldassare Castiglione, to whose good offices the reconciliation of\r\nFrancesco Maria with Julius has been partly attributed. In the affair\r\nof the Cardinal of Pavia, the Count warmly espoused his part, and\r\ninvented for him, as a deprecatory device, a lion rampant proper on\r\na field gules, holding a rapier, and a scroll inscribed, _Non deest\r\ngeneroso in pectore virtus_, \"Worth is never wanting in a generous\r\nbreast\"; but this emblem was seldom used, being odious to the college\r\nof cardinals, as approving a sacrilegious precedent. Castiglione's\r\nelegant endowments were especially qualified to gain him the ear of\r\na prince whose pride it was to emulate his predecessors, as much\r\nin the grace of their court as in the fame of their arms; and the\r\npreference for so small a state shown by him whom monarchs would\r\nhave delighted to honour, was fit subject for gratitude, independent\r\nof the real services which the Duke derived from the friendship of\r\none so well versed in business. It is stated, although on doubtful\r\nauthority, that he went upon a mission from Urbino, to urge on Henry\r\nVIII. a descent upon Calais,[*255] in the hope of such a diversion\r\nrecalling Louis from Italy. If so, it was probably in arranging the\r\ntreaty of Malines on the 5th of April of this year. In the prospect\r\nof adding Pesaro to his dominions, Francesco Maria had promised to\r\nCastiglione a fief in his dependencies, and in September, 1513, a\r\ncharter was granted to him of Novillara, erected into a countship.\r\nThe letter of donation specially mentions the faithful, sincere,\r\nand acceptable services of Baldassare; his elegance in the Latin\r\nand Italian languages; his skill in military and civil affairs;\r\nand confers upon him this favour rather in earnest of future and\r\nmore ample benefits, than as a reward of the fatigues, perils, and\r\nanxieties which he had already undergone for the Duke.[*256] Of this\r\ngrant he received a willing confirmation from Leo X., to whom, on his\r\nelevation, he had borne Francesco Maria's first congratulations. The\r\nbrief to this effect dwells on the peculiar satisfaction with which\r\nthe Pope thus testified, from long acquaintance, his high merits, his\r\ndistinguished birth, his literary acquirements, his military fame,\r\nand his exemplary devotion to the Holy See.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *255: Henry landed at Calais August 1st, 1513; it was\r\nthen in English hands, as it remained till Mary Tudor lost it\r\nin 1558. From Calais Henry advanced to the siege of Terouenne.\r\nCastiglione was, of course, in London in 1506 to receive the Garter\r\nfor Guidobaldo from Henry VII.; a second journey seems apocryphal.\r\nOn Castiglione at Urbino and elsewhere, cf. LUZIO e RENIER, _Mantova e\r\nUrbino_ (Torino, 1893), pp. 174, 234, 242 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *256: Yet he seems to have suffered in the war. His long\r\nresidence at Urbino may well have been due to the Duchess, who loved\r\nhim sincerely.]\r\n\r\nThe estate thus associated with Castiglione is generally said to owe\r\nits name to its \"noble air\"; and certainly upon the Italian principle\r\nthat a healthful atmosphere must be sought in high places, that of\r\nNovillara ought to possess unusual virtues. But the learned Olivieri\r\nhas corrected this vulgar error, and has derived its denomination\r\nfrom the Latin _nubilare_, which he renders as an open shed for the\r\nhousing of grain,--a grange, as it might be called. He has traced\r\nit back to the twelfth century, and to the fourteenth ascribes\r\nan imposing tower of three commodious stories built here by the\r\nMalatesta. Hither was conducted, on her first arrival, Camilla of\r\nAragon, bride of Costanzo Sforza Lord of Pesaro; and its inaccessible\r\nsituation did not prevent a splendid manifestation of the general\r\njoy, in fêtes and pageants, commemorated in a volume of excessive\r\nrarity, which seem more proportioned to the affectionate gallantry of\r\nher husband and subjects, than to the resources of their state, or to\r\nthe conveniences of this palace. Representations of the community\r\nof Pesaro induced Francesco Maria to obtain from Castiglione a\r\nrestitution to them of this Castle, in 1522, under promise of\r\nreplacing it by an equivalent, which was never redeemed. Years passed\r\naway, notwithstanding repeated remonstrances on the part of Camillo,\r\nson of the Count, in which he even induced the Emperor to join. At\r\nlength, in 1573, Guidobaldo II. conferred a tardy compensation, by\r\ngranting to Count Camillo the Castel del Isola del Piano. This Duke\r\nhad previously built an addition to the palace of Novillara, with\r\nelaborate decorations never completed. At his son's marriage with\r\nLucretia d'Este, this fief, then worth 500 scudi a year, was settled\r\nupon her, but rarely occupied. It subsequently caught the young\r\nprince Federigo's fancy, who had planned for its beautiful gardens\r\nand frescoes, when untimely death cut short his schemes, and brought\r\nthe nationality of Urbino and Pesaro to a close.\r\n\r\nIn the present day Novillara consists of about a hundred houses,\r\nhuddled together, threaded by narrow alleys, and walled in by\r\nterraces. It overlooks Pesaro and Fano, the valleys of the Isauro\r\nand Metauro, with the hilly land which separates them. Northward the\r\neye rests on Monte Bartolo, but southward it roams as far as Loreto,\r\nand in clear weather the Dalmatian coast may be discerned. The tower\r\nof the Malatesta, which formed a landmark to the whole surrounding\r\ncountry, fell in 1723, and the dilapidated fabric of the della Rovere\r\nnow harbours a few squalid families, adding another to the melancholy\r\nwrecks of departed grandeur too frequent in this fair land. Yet\r\nNovillara will pass down the stream of Italian literary history as\r\nthe title of its courtly lord, and its magnificent panorama may well\r\nrepay the traveller who has leisure and strength to scramble to its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nThe early policy of Leo was entirely pacific. The leading aim of his\r\ndiplomacy was to soothe those irritations which his predecessors had\r\nfomented throughout Europe, and to heal the wounds thence resulting\r\nto Italy. His only aggressive measures during 1513 had been directed\r\nagainst the French, with the patriotic view of thwarting renewed\r\nattempts upon the Peninsula, in which they were seconded by Spain\r\nand Venice. In this object he was successful, but as the various\r\nand complicated transactions by which it was effected are foreign\r\nto our immediate purpose, we refer the reader for details to the\r\ntenth, twelfth, and thirteenth chapters of Roscoe's delightful work,\r\nalthough naturally representing them in the lights more favourable to\r\nthe Pontiff's motives than we are prepared fully to approve. Power\r\nis, however, a dangerous draught, often exciting the thirst it seeks\r\nto slake. Before the Keys had been many months in Leo's possession,\r\nthe establishment of his own family in the two fairest sovereignties\r\nof Italy became the object for which he was to\r\n\r\n     \"Cry havock, and let slip the dogs of war.\"\r\n\r\nAnticipating changes which might occur upon the death of Ferdinand\r\nII. of Spain, he conceived hopes of throwing off foreign domination\r\nin Naples, and providing for it a king of Italian birth, in his own\r\nbrother Giuliano the Magnificent. With this ulterior advancement\r\nin fancied perspective, he removed him from the management of\r\naffairs at Florence, and substituted his nephew Lorenzo, intending\r\nere long to assert for the latter a titular as well as a virtual\r\nsovereignty, and to extend his sway over all Tuscany, Urbino, and\r\nFerrara. These ambitious and revolutionary projects required powerful\r\naid, which could be most readily secured by finding a sharer in the\r\nadventure. Such a one readily occurred in Louis XII., whose consent\r\nto copartnery could scarcely be doubted, when his long-cherished\r\nacquisition of the Milanese was offered as his share of its gains.\r\nIt was no serious objection to this scheme that it inferred a total\r\nsubversion of Leo's anti-gallican policy; and, intent only upon his\r\nnew views, he secretly negotiated with the French King to bring once\r\nmore into Lombardy those troops which, but the year before, he had\r\nbeen the chief means of ignominiously chasing beyond the Alps. Should\r\nthis move place the great powers in general collision, there was all\r\nthe fairer chance for papal ambition in the scramble; and it mattered\r\nlittle that Italy should again be laid in ashes, and saturated with\r\nblood, so that the Medici became arbiters of her destiny.\r\n\r\nWith a view to these arrangements, Giuliano was betrothed in the\r\nfollowing year to Filiberta of Savoy, maternal aunt of Francis, heir\r\nto the French crown. But a fatality seems to have attended most\r\npapal diplomacy: based upon nepotism or personal ambition, it was\r\ngenerally thwarted by its own fickleness or imbecility. Doubtful of\r\nthe success of his scheme upon the crown of Naples (which Louis was\r\nlittle disposed to gratify, although prepared to concede to Giuliano\r\nthe principality of Tarento), or impatient perhaps of waiting for\r\nits becoming vacant, the Pontiff turned his views upon Parma and\r\nPiacenza, as a convenient interim state for his brother, to be\r\naggrandised by the purchase of Modena from the Emperor for 40,000\r\ngolden ducats. But here he was met by a difficulty of his own recent\r\ncreation, for the establishment of Louis at Milan must have proved\r\ndangerous to the proposed principality of Giuliano; so, once more\r\nshuffling the cards, he prepared some new combinations for preventing\r\nthe French expedition into Italy. One of these was an intrigue to\r\ndetach the Venetian republic from the party of Louis, for which\r\npurpose he sent thither his adroit secretary Bembo, whose memorial\r\nto the senate has been printed by Roscoe. This attempt, however,\r\nentirely failed, and the King's death, on the 1st of January, alone\r\nprevented the detection of his faithless ally.[257]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: One of the shrewd agents of the maritime republic\r\nsupplied a key to the policy of Leo, by observing that it consisted\r\nin immediately opening a secret understanding with the avowed enemy\r\nof whatever prince he leagued with. His intrigues in behalf of his\r\nbrother and nephew are illustrated by some documents in the _Archivio\r\nStorico Italiano_, Appendix I., 306.]\r\n\r\nIn returning from Venice, Bembo paid one more visit to the Feltrian\r\ncourt, now at Pesaro, rejoicing in the recent birth of an heir to\r\nthe Dukedom. There he found many changes. The gay and accomplished\r\ncircle, in whose lighter or more pedantic pastimes he had borne a\r\nwilling part, was scattered, many of its members like himself to hold\r\nappointments of trust and dignity. But it was a sincere satisfaction\r\nto him again to meet the Duchess Elisabetta, now recovered from the\r\ndeep despondency he has so touchingly described, and enjoying the\r\nsociety of her accomplished niece and successor, as well as of her\r\nformer mistress of the revels, the merry Emilia Pia. In company\r\nof these ladies, the diplomatist forgot during a brief interval\r\nthe cares of state, and lingered for two days on the excuse of\r\nindisposition, until he thought it necessary to explain his delay\r\nin a letter to Cardinal Bibbiena of the 1st of January, 1515.[258]\r\nThe fatigues of riding post a hundred and forty miles from Chioggia\r\nin two days and a half required this repose, and induced him to\r\ncontinue his journey in less hot haste. Yet Bembo, with all his\r\naccomplishments, was but a sunshine courtier, as we shall see some\r\nfifteen months later.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: See below, p. 368.]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that, at the time of Giuliano's marriage, the idea\r\nof providing for him large additions in Romagna to his Lombard\r\nprincipality was the leading motive of his brother's policy,\r\nand that the Dukes of Urbino and Ferrara were already viewed as\r\nstepping-stones to his exaltation. The command of the pontifical\r\ntroops was accordingly bestowed upon him as Gonfaloniere, on the\r\n24th of June, 1515, at once an injustice and an insult to Francesco\r\nMaria, in whose hands its baton remained unsullied.[*259] The fair\r\nprofessions with which the Duke was superseded were vague and\r\nunsatisfactory, and he received warning from various quarters of\r\nthe sinister designs whereof he was the destined victim. These,\r\nhowever, being as yet immature, the Pontiff maintained professions\r\nof unwavering favour, and, in a brief dated on the 16th of August,\r\nhe assures the Duke that he will readily regard certain services as\r\nentitled to the largest and most liberal remuneration in his power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *259: However, Francesco's record was not a very brilliant\r\none. He failed to take Mirandola without Julius II., and the affair\r\nof Ravenna would, one might think, have ruined any soldier.]\r\n\r\nYet Giuliano must be acquitted of the ingratitude and perfidy\r\nshown to his former friend by the Pope and his nephew Lorenzo. The\r\nhospitalities of Duke Guidobaldo had in his case fallen upon no\r\narid soil. His fondest recollections of lettered intercourse and\r\nof youthful love were centred in Urbino. He remembered that it was\r\nFrancesco Maria who, six years before, had interposed to screen him\r\nfrom the jealousies of the late Pontiff, and who had warmly urged the\r\nrestoration of his family in Florence. He therefore firmly refused\r\nto acquiesce in any projects which would aggrandise himself at the\r\nDuke's cost; and, in token of good will, while on his way to France,\r\nmade a detour to visit him at Gubbio, where he thus addressed him:\r\n\"I have heard, my Lord, that it has been represented to you how the\r\nPope has a mind to take your state from you, in order to give it me;\r\nbut this is not true, for, on account of the kindness, favour, and\r\nbenefits I ever have received from your Excellency and your house,\r\nI should never consent to it, however much desired by his Holiness,\r\nlest other princes of your rank should resolve, in consequence, never\r\nagain to give such refuge at their courts as was granted to me and\r\nmine. Be assured, therefore, that, whilst I live, you not only will\r\nreceive no molestation on my account, but will be ever regarded by\r\nme as an elder brother.\"[260] Upon these assurances, Francesco Maria\r\nnot only suspended the defences of his duchy, which he had begun\r\nto put in order, but accepted an engagement for himself, with two\r\nhundred men-at-arms and a hundred light horse, under Giuliano, the\r\npontifical captain-general. To secure himself, however, against all\r\ncontingencies, he applied to the Pontiff for leave to bring into the\r\nfield a thousand infantry, in addition to his usual following. The\r\nscruples of Giuliano did not in any way soften his brother, whose\r\nintrigues against Urbino are prominent in the curious despatch of his\r\nsecretary Bibbiena, which Roscoe has printed under date the 16th of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: Dialogo Giraldi, Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3153.]\r\n\r\nLouis XII. died on the 1st of January, 1515, and was succeeded by\r\nhis second and third cousin, Francis I. This event changed not the\r\nprojects of Leo in behalf of his brother, whose marriage to the\r\nPrincess of Savoy was solemnised in February, and who was received\r\nby the French monarch with kindness and distinction. To render his\r\nposition fully worthy of the match, the Pope invested him with Parma,\r\nPiacenza, and Modena, yielding a revenue approaching to 48,000\r\nducats. He likewise settled a large pension upon the princess, and\r\nprovided for the pair a magnificent palace in Rome, to which they\r\nwere welcomed with a pomp unusual even in these days of pageantry.\r\n\r\nLeo's position with reference to Francis I. was in many respects\r\nembarrassing, and the defence of his policy, elaborately undertaken\r\nby Roscoe, has established the writer's bias rather than the\r\nPontiff's rectitude. That monarch was steadily pursuing those\r\nschemes upon the Milanese which Leo had the year before suggested\r\nto his predecessor; and the amicable relations established with\r\nthe Medici by Giuliano's marriage gave him additional reason to\r\nrely upon the Pontiff's support in the struggle which must follow\r\nhis descent upon Italy. But to restrain the French beyond their\r\nAlpine barrier was the favourite, as well as the natural policy of\r\nhis Holiness, and it was that which tended most to the security of\r\nhis brother's newly-acquired Lombard sovereignty. He therefore,\r\nin July, after some months of anxious vacillation, avowed his\r\nadherence to the league of the Emperor with the Kings of England\r\nand of Spain, to which Florence, Milan, and the Swiss were parties.\r\nYet he was far from hearty in the cause, and, during the brief\r\ncampaign which succeeded the arrival of a French army in Lombardy,\r\nthe ecclesiastical contingent limited their efforts to watching the\r\nsafety of Parma and Piacenza. Nor did the other allies show much\r\nmore zeal, excepting the Swiss, whose impetuous valour brought on\r\nthe pitched battle of Marignano on the 13th of September, and lost\r\nthem the prestige which had stamped their infantry as invincible. The\r\ncostly victory there gained by the French was speedily followed by a\r\nsurrender of his claims upon Milan by Duke Maximiliano Sforza, who\r\nwas content to enjoy for the remainder of his life a home and pension\r\nprovided by his conqueror.[*261]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *261: The defeat of the Swiss at Marignano opened the way\r\nfor the long fight between Francis I. and Charles V. It decided many\r\nthings--the future of monarchy in Europe, for instance, as well as\r\nthe fate of the republican army \"so long invincible in Italy.\" Cf.\r\nCREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. V., p. 243. \"What will become\r\nof us,\" said Leo to Giorgi, the Venetian Ambassador, who brought him\r\nthe news of the defeat--\"and of you?\" \"We will put ourselves in the\r\nhands of the Most Christian King,\" he added, \"and will implore his\r\nmercy.\" Cf. the _Relazioni Venete_, 2nd series, vol. III., p. 44,\r\nquoted by Creighton, who, as always, takes the view of a statesman,\r\nand not merely that of a scholar. Sforza surrendered Milan on October\r\n4th. The Pope signed terms with Francis October 13th, 1515. The Pope\r\nwas then in Viterbo, which he left for Bologna in November, coming to\r\nFlorence on the last day of that month. In December he was back in\r\nBologna to meet Francis. He returned to Florence and left for Rome on\r\nFebruary 19th, 1516.]\r\n\r\nThe principal object of Francis being thus effected, he was not\r\nindisposed to reconciliation with the Holy See, for which Leo had\r\nsedulously retained an opening by keeping Ludovico Canossa throughout\r\nthe contest as an accredited agent at the French head-quarters. But\r\nthe Pontiff met the usual reward of trimmers. The tardy accommodation\r\noffered by his envoy came too late to save Parma and Piacenza, for\r\nwhich alone he had become a party to the war. The French monarch\r\nwould not hear of renouncing what he insisted were intrinsic\r\nportions of the Milanese, but offered to meet with the Pontiff and\r\narrange in person a lasting amity, Bologna being named for the\r\ninterview. Upon the diplomatic arrangements which there occupied\r\nthese potentates in the end of the year we need not touch, further\r\nthan to notice that the intercession of Francis in favour of the\r\nDuke of Urbino, which the latter had hastened, after the battle of\r\nMarignano, to bespeak by means of a special envoy, proved quite\r\nineffectual. It obviously was dictated less by any interest in the\r\nDuke's welfare than by the wish to thwart a favourite project of his\r\nfickle ally, and it at once was met by reference to an article which\r\nthe Pope had adroitly inserted in the treaty, that Francis should in\r\nno way interfere for the protection of any undutiful vassal of the\r\nHoly See. From Bologna Leo proceeded to Florence, where he remained\r\nmost of the winter, maturing his schemes for the ruin of Francesco\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nThe death of Ferdinand of Spain in January, 1516, soon reawoke the\r\nambitious hopes of Francis, by reminding him of his predecessor's\r\ndormant claims upon the Neapolitan crown. But a new combination of\r\ncircumstances gave another turn to his thoughts. The efforts of the\r\nVenetians to recover Verona and Brescia from Maximilian brought the\r\nlatter into Lombardy at the head of fifteen thousand Swiss troops,\r\nby whom Lautrec, the French general, was for a time hard pressed,\r\nand Leo, ever anxious to conciliate a conqueror, hastily sent\r\nCardinal Bibbiena with reinforcements to the Emperor's camp. Yet the\r\nstorm, passing off suddenly and harmlessly, left few traces besides\r\njealousy, which the prudence of that wily legate scarcely prevented\r\nfrom arising in the mind of Francis towards his slippery ally.\r\n\r\nThese vacillations on the part of Leo have been slightly touched\r\nupon, in order to clear the ground for displaying his ambitious\r\nnepotism in its proper field,--the duchy of Urbino. This, his\r\nprevailing weakness, had met with many disappointments. No opening\r\noccurred for its exercise in the direction of Naples. Parma and\r\nPiacenza had passed from his grasp, by reluctant surrender to a\r\nprofessing ally. But, worst of all, his favourite brother Giuliano,\r\nthe object in whom centred most of his schemes, had been removed\r\nby death on the 17th of March, not without surmise of poison from\r\nthe jealousy of his nephew Lorenzo.[*262] Although his great\r\npopularity favoured the ambitious views which were thrust upon him\r\nby the Pontiff, his mind lay rather towards elegant pursuits and\r\nsplendid tastes, than to such high aspirations. Indeed, the Venetian\r\nambassador, Capello, represents his dying request to Leo as in favour\r\nof Urbino[*263]; but the Pope waived the discussion of a point upon\r\nwhich his resolution was taken. Lorenzo, his successor in the papal\r\nfavour, was a much more willing, though less conciliatory, instrument\r\nof his Holiness's designs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *262: Giuliano had certainly been ailing for months. His\r\ndeath did not seem to have been unexpected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *263: So does Giorgi. Cf. _Relazioni Venete_, 2nd series,\r\nvol. II., p. 51.]\r\n\r\nLorenzo de' Medici was eldest son of Pietro, the first-born of\r\nLorenzo the Magnificent.[*264] He was born on the 13th of September,\r\n1492, and his youth was passed amid many trials. His father, after\r\nten years of exile from Florence, had been drowned in the Garigliano,\r\nin 1504, and, four years thereafter, his sister Clarissa's marriage\r\nwith Filippo Strozzi involved him in a second banishment. He was of\r\ngood person and gallant presence, endowed with a stirring spirit,\r\nbut destitute of generous or heroic qualities. Giorgi, another\r\nVenetian envoy, even considered him scarcely inferior in cunning and\r\ncapacity to the redoubted Valentino. The government of Florence was\r\ncommitted to him by Leo, on his uncle Giuliano being called to a\r\nhigher destiny, and feeling his advancement restrained by the prior\r\nclaims, as well as by the moderation of the latter, he is believed to\r\nhave removed him by poison; at all events he was immediately named to\r\nsucceed him as gonfaloniere of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *264: Cf. VERDI: _Gli ultimi anni di Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici duca d'Urbino, 1515-1519_ (Pietrogrande, 1905).]\r\n\r\nThis renewed outrage upon Francesco Maria's military rank,[*265]\r\nand the death of the only individual of the Medici upon whom he had\r\nany reliance, warned him of the approaching crisis in his fate. The\r\ninfluence of Alfonsina degli Orsini in favour of her son Lorenzo\r\nstimulated the Pontiff's projects, unwarned by a prediction of\r\nGiuliano that, by following the courses of the Borgia, he would\r\nprobably suffer their fate. The immediate pretext, adopted for\r\noutpouring the accumulated vials of papal wrath, was the Duke's\r\ndeclining to march his troops into Lombardy under Lorenzo as\r\ngonfaloniere, in consequence, as Giraldi informs us, of information\r\nthat his death was resolved upon should he trust his person within\r\nhis rival's power. Accordingly, Leo was no sooner returned to Rome,\r\nthan, affecting to consider this refusal, as the act of overt\r\nrebellion by a subject against his sovereign, he issued a severe\r\nmonitory against his feudatory, summoning him thither to answer\r\nvarious vague or irrelevant charges, one of these being the Cardinal\r\nof Pavia's slaughter, of which he had already received no\r\n\r\n     \"Ragged and forestalled remission,\"\r\n\r\non a report subscribed by Leo himself. Various diplomatic\r\nfunctionaries at the papal court vainly interceded that he should\r\nappear by attorney, instead of surrendering in person; and he\r\nmeanwhile garrisoned Urbino, Pesaro, and S. Leo. The Duchess Dowager,\r\nwhose arms had frequently received and fondled the infant Lorenzo,\r\nwhile her husband's court sheltered the elder members of his house,\r\nhastened to Rome as a mediatrix; but it was with difficulty she\r\nmade her way to the Pope's presence, and she obtained no mercy for\r\nher nephew, nor protection for her own alimentary provisions out\r\nof the duchy, his Holiness refusing to listen to any propositions\r\nuntil the Duke had obeyed the monitory by appearing at Rome before\r\nthe 2nd of April. In consequence of his failure to do so, a bull of\r\nexcommunication went forth on the 27th, depriving him of his state,\r\nand all dignities held of the Holy See, and absolving his subjects\r\nfrom allegiance, on pain of ecclesiastical censures. By a gratuitous\r\nexercise of malevolence, the papal influence was employed with the\r\nKing of Spain for confiscation of Sora, and his other patrimonial\r\nholdings in Naples, thus visiting him with instant beggary. On the\r\n18th of August, his dukedom and ecclesiastical baton were conferred\r\nupon the unworthy Lorenzo, who, in the following month, was also\r\ninvested with the prefecture of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *265: I do not see how this was an outrage. Francesco had\r\nbeen already dismissed: see _supra_ 360. Besides, he had certainly\r\nmade overtures to the French. Cf. GUICCIARDINI, _Storia\r\nd'Italia_, vol. XII.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Alinari_\r\n\r\nLORENZO DI PIERO DE' MEDICI, DUKE OF URBINO\r\n\r\n_After the picture by Bronzino in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]\r\n\r\nThe value of political gratitude is strikingly illustrated in the\r\nfact, that these outrageous measures were adopted, in a consistory\r\ncomposed for the most part of creatures of the della Rovere family,\r\nwith the single dissentient voice of Cardinal Grimani, of Venice,\r\nBishop of Urbino, whose independence earned him an exile from Rome.\r\nNor was this the only painful lesson of the worth of courtier\r\nfidelity now taught to that illustrious house. Even the civilities\r\nof Bembo to the Duchess Dowager sank to a low grade, as he thus\r\nacknowledges in a letter to Bibbiena of the 19th of April:--\"The Lady\r\nDuchess of Urbino, whom I visited yesterday (a duty which I, however,\r\nvery rarely perform), commends herself to you, as does also the Lady\r\nEmilia. On these dames the Signor Unico [Accolti] dances attendance.\r\nHe is more than ever in the heat of his old passion, which he\r\ndeclares now numbers five lustres and a half; and he has better\r\nhopes than heretofore of at length obtaining the consummation of his\r\ndesires, having been asked by the Lady Duchess to _improvisare_, by\r\nwhich means he trusts to move that stony heart to tears--at the\r\nleast. He is to rehearse in two or three days, and as soon as he\r\ndoes so, I shall report to you: would that you could be here, as he\r\nis sure to do it right well.\" It can scarcely be doubted that this\r\ninnuendo was meant to apply to the more exalted of these ladies.\r\nWhether as a caustic sneer, or a current scandal, it comes ill from\r\nsuch a quarter, and only adds a new proof of the poet's inordinate\r\nconceit. Nor did it go unpunished, for we find such vain effrontery\r\nthus lashed by Gandolfo Porrino, a contemporary satirist:--\r\n\r\n     \"In such affairs the palm he gives to one beyond all gold,\r\n     Urbino's Duchess dowager, your cousin scarce yet old.\r\n     Long at that court Lord Unico had paragoned her face,\r\n     With words and pen, in wondrous phrase, to angels' matchless grace.\r\n     Till, gazing on those saint-like eyes, while tears bedimmed his own,\r\n     The secret of his passion thus he breathed to her alone:\r\n     'All goddess fair! my love for thee all other loves exceeds,\r\n     No Launcelot, no errant knight, its lightning course outspeeds!\r\n     Prithee with me participate the boon that cannot cloy,\r\n     And share in mutual confidence a bliss without alloy.'\r\n     Unlike those artful hypocrites who evil speeches spurn,\r\n     But wink at acts, the prudent dame thus answer did return:\r\n     'Remember that we hapless wives must each their lord obey,\r\n     Tyrant or kind, his dread behests we never may gainsay;\r\n     Mine is the Duke, to whom your wish propose, should he assent,\r\n     As well I wot, right readily your whim shall I content.'\r\n     Confounded by her sarcasm the carpet-knight was left\r\n     Poor victim of his vanity, of self-respect bereft.\"\r\n\r\nThe now inevitable war was opened by a simultaneous movement upon the\r\nduchy from three several quarters. Renzo, that is, Lorenzo da Ceri,\r\naccompanied by Lorenzo de' Medici and a powerful army, advanced from\r\nRomagna; Vitello Vitelli marched upon Massa Trabaria; and, on the\r\n12th of May, Gianpaolo Baglioni seized on Gubbio.[*266] The force\r\nthus poured upon the state amounted to seventeen thousand foot,\r\nabove a thousand men-at-arms, and near two thousand light horse.\r\nThat which Francesco Maria could bring into the field numbered about\r\nnine thousand men, and being averse to entail upon his subjects the\r\nmiseries of an unavailing struggle, he authorised their surrender,\r\nexcepting the citadels of Pesaro, Urbino, S. Leo, and Maiuolo, which\r\nhe garrisoned for resistance. His attempts to obtain the mediation\r\nor support of foreign powers entirely failed. Their sympathy and\r\ncondolence were freely doled out to him, but none gave hope of\r\nefficient aid, except Maximilian, whose promises, on this as on all\r\nother occasions, proved quite worthless. It only remained to bow, as\r\nhis uncle Guidobaldo had done, before the storm, and await happier\r\ntimes. On the 31st he sent off from Pesaro his consort, in an ailing\r\nstate, his infant son, and the dowager Duchess to their relations at\r\nMantua, with such valuables as they could transport in six or eight\r\nvessels, and, speedily following them, he embarked at midnight and\r\nreached that city in disguise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *266: Cf. PELLEGRINI, _Gubbio sotto i conti e\r\nDuchi d'Urbino_, in _Boll. per l'Umbria_, vol. XI., p. 221. Gianpaolo\r\nBaglioni da Perugia entered the Eugubine territory with 100 knights,\r\n500 horse, and 3000 foot. The Duke wrote that he could not defend\r\nGubbio. On the 31st May the Consiglio was called together, and it\r\ndecided: \"redire ad Romanam ecclesiam et sub regimine s. D.N.\"]\r\n\r\nPesaro, after an eight days' siege, capitulated on honourable terms,\r\nin breach of which Tranquillo Giraldi, the commandant, was hanged\r\nupon a vague accusation of bad faith. Urbino having, by order of its\r\nsovereign, been surrendered without a blow on the 30th of May,[*267]\r\nthe community, on the 16th of June, sent deputies to kiss the Pope's\r\nfeet on taking possession of the state, in hopes of obtaining\r\nrelaxation of the interdict; but his Holiness raised it only for\r\nsuch as adhered to the existing order of things. He committed the\r\ngovernment of the town to its new bishop, Giulio Vitelli, who\r\nintrigued at all hands to induce the magistracy to follow the example\r\nset them in other places, of petitioning his Holiness to give them\r\nan independent sovereign, in order that the exaltation of his nephew\r\nto the dukedom might seem a popular measure. On the 16th of June\r\nthe interdict was removed from all the duchy except S. Leo, which\r\nalone held out; but, faithful to the proverb of hating him whom he\r\nhad injured, the Pontiff was deaf to all entreaties for restoration\r\nto church privileges of his victim, who consequently remained in\r\nhiding at Goito near Mantua, apart from his family, that he might\r\nnot involve them in excommunication, and giving out that he had fled\r\nacross the Alps, in order to baffle those who sought his life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *267: ZACCAGNINI has published an unknown poem\r\non this taking of Urbino. See _Un poemetto sconosciuto sulla presa\r\nd'Urbino del 1516_, in _Le Marche_ (1906), An. VI., p. 145.]\r\n\r\nThe example of Guidobaldo kept alive his hopes of regaining his\r\nsovereignty, as that Duke had done, by means of S. Leo. But ere he\r\ncould organise measures for a descent, he had the grief of learning\r\nits fall. As there is always something of romantic adventure in\r\nthe surprise of a place impregnable by ordinary expedients, we may\r\ndwell for a moment on the third and last successful leaguer of this\r\nfortress. The garrison consisted of a hundred and twenty men, one\r\ntenth of whom had fallen in its defence. After three months spent in\r\nhopeless assaults, a Florentine carpenter, named Antonio, observing\r\nfrom the opposite heights the absence of sentinels over one of the\r\nmost precipitous parts of the rock, attempted to make his way up the\r\nface of it, sometimes aided by plants and bushes in the clefts, but\r\ngenerally driving iron spikes into their crevices, and fastening\r\nropes, ladders, or beams, as he advanced. After four nights of this\r\nperilous toil he reached the wall, which he found, as expected,\r\nwithout defenders. Having reported the way accessible, a number of\r\nlight infantry were entrusted to his guidance, whom he ordered to\r\nstrip their headgear and shoes, and to strap upon their backs their\r\nshields, swords, and hatchets. On the 30th of September, under cover\r\nof a wet and foggy night, he conducted these safely to the summit,\r\naccompanied by a drummer and four pair of colours. At daybreak,\r\nan alarm was given from the watch-tower of an assault upon the\r\ngate, towards which the besiegers had sent a party; and, whilst the\r\ndefenders hurried in that direction, Antonio, with some fifty men,\r\ncleared the walls, displayed their colours, and beat to arms. Ere the\r\ngarrison had recovered their presence of mind, the gate was opened by\r\nthe escalading party to their comrades, and the place was carried.\r\nThe citadel was held for twenty-five days longer by a handful\r\nof desperate men, but they at length surrendered to one Antonio\r\nRiccasoli of Florence, who placed upon the castle a vainglorious\r\ninscription, claiming for himself the genius of another Dedalus. The\r\nfortress had been commanded by Sigismondo Varana, Count of Camerino,\r\nthe Duke's young nephew, assisted by an experienced captain of the\r\nUbaldini; and the good treatment experienced by the garrison gave\r\nrise to a suspicion of treachery on their part, Sigismondo alone\r\nbeing sent to Volterra as prisoner of war. Much of the Duke's\r\ntreasure was taken, and the loss of S. Leo proved a serious blow to\r\nhis interests.[268]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 906, 907, 928; Vat. Ottob. MSS. No.\r\n3153.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n     The Duke returns to his state--His struggle with the\r\n     usurper--His victory at Montebartolo.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fatal wars originating in the League of Cambray were\r\nfinally concluded, by a treaty offensive and defensive, between the\r\nyoung monarchs of France and Spain, guaranteeing their respective\r\nItalian possessions, which was signed at Nogon on the 13th of August,\r\nand was followed by that of London on the 29th of October, to which\r\nthe Pope, the Emperor, Charles V., and Henry VIII., were parties.\r\nA general pacification having been thus obtained, Francesco Maria\r\nwas further than ever from assistance in recovering his rights,\r\nyet the moment seemed not unfavourable for a single-handed attempt\r\nat asserting them. The numerous condottieri of all nations, thus\r\nthrown loose without prospect of new occupation, offered him their\r\nservices on very easy terms, preferring employment on the credit\r\nof eventual pay, with the chance of interim pillage, to a life of\r\nlistless beggary. The French and Venetians secretly favoured any\r\nadventure which should rid their territories of such odious inmates,\r\nand the Duke found no great difficulty in mustering, by the beginning\r\nof the year, three thousand eight hundred infantry and six hundred\r\nlight horse. He placed the latter under his wife's cousin, Federigo\r\nGonzaga, Marquis of Bozzolo, a young man who singularly mingled\r\nthe staid wisdom of a veteran commander with the jovial manners of\r\na free companion, and was thus equally the confidential adviser\r\nof his general, and the idol of his men. He had also become a\r\npersonal enemy of Lorenzo, from having been deprived by him of the\r\ncommand committed to him by Giuliano de' Medici. This motley army\r\nwas composed of tried soldiers, but was deficient in the material\r\nfor a sustained campaign, notwithstanding the Duke's great exertions\r\nand sacrifices, by borrowing money at all hands, and by selling his\r\nwife's valuables, to provide for it the most necessary munitions.\r\nBefore taking the field, he, on the 17th of January, addressed to\r\nthe Sacred College, and publicly placarded, this earnest protest and\r\nvindication of his measures, which, although prolix, is an important\r\nmanifesto.\r\n\r\n     \"Most reverend and respected Lords: I have ever flattered\r\n     myself that the long persecutions, which exposed me to so\r\n     many perils, have not lost me your Reverences' favour,\r\n     nor rendered you personally hostile to me; indeed, I\r\n     feel assured that you have always looked upon me with\r\n     compassion, and pitied my misfortunes. Nor did I enjoy,\r\n     amid such adversities, any consolation more efficacious\r\n     than my conviction that your Sacred College considers me in\r\n     nowise worthy of such persecutions. But, as I always have\r\n     been, am, and shall through life continue, your most humble\r\n     and obedient servant, I hold myself bound to account to\r\n     you for every action, and to defend myself from whatever\r\n     imputations my enemies may have made to your very reverend\r\n     Lordships, in whom repose all my hopes of protection.\r\n\r\n     \"I presume that you have heard of my new enterprise against\r\n     my own state, dictated, not by any desire to disturb,\r\n     embarrass, or molest the interests of the Church, but\r\n     rather by a wish to commit my life upon the hazard of the\r\n     war, trusting that God will so direct its issue as that\r\n     my innocence, so known to his divine providence, may be\r\n     equally manifested to all the world. And in this assurance\r\n     I proceed, not rashly or presumptuously, but aware that\r\n     neither my resources, which are at present next to nothing,\r\n     nor those of the most potent monarch, would suffice to\r\n     resist the might of his Holiness, supported as he is by\r\n     all the sovereigns and powers of Christendom; relying,\r\n     moreover, on Almighty God, the King of kings, who can, and,\r\n     as I hope, will, aid and defend me in this calamity, since\r\n     He, to whom the hearts of men are open, knows that I have\r\n     no other expedient left for my peace or life itself. After\r\n     having betaken myself to the illustrious Lord Marquis, my\r\n     father-in-law, at Mantua, and placed myself in a sort of\r\n     voluntary imprisonment; after having lost my fortresses,\r\n     and nearly all my worldly possessions; and having even\r\n     made up my mind to promise his Holiness not to make any\r\n     attempt upon my state, or disturb his nephew, to whom he\r\n     had given it,--my sole wish being to live; still, so far\r\n     from obtaining a relaxation of the censures, other and\r\n     harsher interdicts were constantly issued against me, with\r\n     positive injunctions to my distinguished father-in-law not\r\n     to harbour me in his territory. Nay, I daily discover plots\r\n     against my life by poison or the dagger; which, however, I\r\n     attribute not to my Lord his Holiness, convinced that his\r\n     clemency and goodness are irreconcilable with so ardent a\r\n     thirst for my blood, and such perfidious ingratitude for\r\n     the numberless benefits which, setting aside more remote\r\n     recollections, he and all his house received from myself,\r\n     when in straits similar to what I now endure, but rather to\r\n     my enemies, who, in effecting my ruin, bring infamy upon\r\n     his Holiness, and think thus to force me to flee for my\r\n     life into Turkey.\r\n\r\n     \"Compelled, then, by these considerations, I have set\r\n     forward towards my own home, in the belief that, even\r\n     should my death ensue, infamy never can; and in the\r\n     conviction that, if it was right for his Holiness, whilst\r\n     living as a cardinal in honour and dignity, to occasion\r\n     the cruel sack of Prato, in order to regain those rights\r\n     of citizenship from which he had been outlawed, it will be\r\n     far more justifiable in me, an outlaw, not from one city,\r\n     but from all Christendom, and deprived, not merely of my\r\n     temporal dignities, but almost of the means of subsistence,\r\n     the sacraments of the Church, and the intercourse of\r\n     mankind, by a persecution which directs at once temporal\r\n     and spiritual weapons against my station, life, and\r\n     soul;--it will, I say, be justifiable for me to attempt\r\n     my restoration to the state, of which, in the opinion of\r\n     my own people, and of all men except his Holiness, I am\r\n     the legitimate sovereign. I therefore supplicate your\r\n     most reverend Lordships, by the pity due to such as have\r\n     blamelessly fallen into misfortune, that you will deign to\r\n     afford me protection, falling upon some means or expedient\r\n     for mitigating the Pontiff's feelings; seeing I cannot but\r\n     think that your influence, his own natural goodness, and my\r\n     innocence must break down that obduracy which the unjust\r\n     lips and guileful tongues of my adversaries have raised\r\n     towards me in the mind of his Holiness; for, to regain\r\n     his favour, there is no submission or endurable penance\r\n     that I would refuse. And, should I not be deemed worthy of\r\n     such compassion, you, my very reverend Lords, may at least\r\n     condescend in silence to favour my cause with your best\r\n     wishes and thoughts, and efficiently to recommend me to\r\n     the unfailing bounty and justice of God. If my success be\r\n     as signal as I hope, I shall stand indebted to your most\r\n     reverend Lordships, believing that the Almighty has heard\r\n     your reasonable desires, and extended his protection to me\r\n     through your merits. Or, on the other hand, should my puny\r\n     force not be overborne by the weight of the papal power,\r\n     backed by spiritual weapons, it will be a palpable miracle,\r\n     and proof sufficient that my innocence, though on earth\r\n     condemned by men, will be cleared in Heaven by a higher\r\n     and more equitable Judge. And so, ever kissing humbly your\r\n     Reverences' hands, I commend myself to your favour. From\r\n     Sermene, the 17th of January, 1517.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Giraldi[269] is a safe authority as to many details\r\nof this enterprise, his uncle Benedetto having been an officer much\r\nin the Duke's confidence. We, therefore, venture to extract the\r\nharangue which he puts into the mouth of Francesco Maria, before\r\nmarching from Sermene, not, of course, as his verbatim address to his\r\nfollowers, but as containing the understanding on both sides of their\r\nrespective obligations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: Vat. Ottob. MSS. No. 3153, f. 115.]\r\n\r\n     \"'Soldiers and Comrades, I have assembled you here, in\r\n     order that you may fully learn my mind and intentions, and\r\n     that I may know yours. I therefore acquaint you that I have\r\n     arranged with your leaders, who have promised, and bound\r\n     themselves by articles, to accompany me into my state of\r\n     Urbino, and to re-establish me in my home, and to maintain\r\n     me there during life, indifferent to pay or remuneration\r\n     beyond such as I may be able to give,--I confiding to them\r\n     my state and person, in reliance upon your good faith. I\r\n     now wish to know if you are all agreed to follow me in this\r\n     enterprise; and, should this be your pleasure, I desire\r\n     from you an oath never to abandon me on any contingency\r\n     that may occur, and that, in case of being forced to\r\n     quit me by the pressure of events without completing our\r\n     undertaking, you will oblige yourselves to return to this\r\n     place as a rendezvous, and, further, that you shall not\r\n     desert me for any offers or bribes of the enemy. Avowing to\r\n     you at the same time that, at this moment, I have not above\r\n     a ducat a-piece to give you, I nevertheless feel confident\r\n     our gains will be great, unless fortune be more than\r\n     adverse; and I promise that all the booty will be yours,\r\n     and that I shall be your comrade, never sparing my life\r\n     while it lasts. If you accept these my terms, you must all\r\n     swear to observe them; otherwise I shall not move from this\r\n     territory of my brother-in-law.' Whereupon they all, with\r\n     extended hands, took an oath never to abandon him during\r\n     life; and so they set forth in the name of God, on the 17th\r\n     of January, led by Federigo di Bozzolo.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff was taken at unawares, for, believing his enemy utterly\r\ncrushed, he made light of such warnings as had reached him of a\r\ncontemplated movement against the duchy; but now that the expedition\r\nwas matured, he knew well the slight hold which the usurper had upon\r\nthe affections of his nominal subjects. Nor was he more at ease as to\r\nthe inclinations of his new allies in Lombardy, whose stipendiaries\r\nhad thus suddenly turned their arms against him. His anxiety was in\r\nno way diminished by the representations of his confidential friend\r\nBibbiena, who, actuated perhaps by some lurking kindness for the\r\nhouse of Urbino, urged him to abandon the Borgian policy he had in\r\nhand, until such persuasions were silenced by the threatened poignard\r\nof Lorenzo. Ere effectual precautions could be adopted in Romagna,\r\nFrancesco Maria had rallied round him eight thousand infantry and\r\nfifteen hundred horse, most of them veterans, and with these he\r\nmarched about the middle of January. Passing Rimini, where his\r\nrival lay \"sorely perplexed and bewildered\" (to use the phrase of\r\nMinio, the Venetian envoy), he advanced under every discouragement\r\nof an inclement season, his men wading through snow to the middle,\r\nand swimming frequent-swollen torrents. From the secrecy of his\r\npreparations and the poverty of his resources, his commissariat was\r\naltogether inadequate; but, on reaching his frontier, the refusal of\r\nGradara to submit afforded his men an excuse for compensating their\r\nprivations by its sack.\r\n\r\nHis subjects had been prepared by emissaries for a general revolt.\r\nOn the 1st of February, Count Carlo Gabrielli raised the cry of\r\n\"Feltro! Feltro!\" at Gubbio, and it was enthusiastically responded\r\nto through the smaller towns. On the 5th, the Duke was within a few\r\nmiles of Urbino, then held by Bishop Vitelli, with a garrison of\r\ntwo thousand men, who, distrusting the inhabitants, summoned their\r\nmilitia to muster at S. Bernardino, and closed the gates as soon as\r\nthe city had thus been cleared of its able-bodied men, refusing to\r\nreadmit them on pain of instant death. The excluded citizens vented\r\ntheir indignation at this trick, in threats and abuse of the garrison\r\nfrom under the very walls, which at length provoked a sortie of\r\nfour hundred infantry in order to disperse them. At this juncture,\r\na squadron of one hundred cavalry, sent on by Francesco Maria under\r\nBenedetto Giraldi of Mondolfo, for the purpose of supporting the\r\nexpected rising in his favour, arrived three miles below Urbino, and,\r\nwhilst breathing their horses, heard that the enemy were abroad.\r\nBenedetto immediately left his little force in charge of his brother\r\nAnnibale, and rode on with but five officers to reconnoitre. The\r\nadventure which followed, equally worthy of a bold knight-errant and\r\na Christian soldier, must be told as in the Dialogue of his nephew\r\nTranquillo. \"Coming suddenly upon the detachment, about half a mile\r\nfrom the town, Benedetto exclaimed, 'Look there! as these are the\r\nfirst of our master's foes we have fallen in with, it would surely be\r\na shame to let them get back to the city without a taste of us: I am\r\ntherefore resolved to make a dash at them, and if you will follow me,\r\nby God's grace we shall have the first victory.' This said, he rushed\r\ninto the midst of them, with vizor up and lance in rest, overthrowing\r\nmany by the shock. His weapon having broken, he performed prodigies\r\nwith his sword, and, aided by his followers, who had not shrunk\r\nfrom his summons, the enemy's leaders were slain, and their whole\r\nbattalion dispersed in panic through the fields, where most of them\r\nwere put to death by the excluded townsfolk, who had mustered at\r\nthe first alarm. I, too, came up with our squadron, in time to cut\r\noff a good many of them; but I had little cause to congratulate\r\nmyself upon that success, for, passing near my brother [Benedetto],\r\nhe said to me, 'Annibale, I am killed.' Whereupon, looking towards\r\nhim, I observed a cut in his face, and told him to fear nothing, as\r\nface wounds were not mortal; but he replied, 'It's worse than that,\r\nfor I am run through the body by a pike.' At these words my heart\r\nseemed riven asunder; yet, in order not to alarm him, I desired him\r\nto cheer up, and commend himself to God Almighty, and to the most\r\nglorious Mother of the Saviour, and to vow his armour and horse to\r\nLoreto, adding that I too would offer a housing worth twenty-five\r\nducats. 'I am content,' answered he, 'to give this horse, a gallant\r\nTurkish charger bestowed upon me by the Marquis of Mantua, along\r\nwith these arms; but I have only one favour to ask of the Saviour\r\nof mankind, which is, that he will permit me to live long enough to\r\nconfess myself.' As he said this an Observantine friar, who had on\r\nformer occasions confessed him, came up, and, after thanking God\r\nfor having heard his prayer, he summoned the monk, and returning\r\nto Cavallino confessed himself. There being no surgeon at hand, a\r\ngentleman of Mantua named Stigino cleansed the wound by suction, and\r\nascertained that the bowels were not pierced, which afforded me much\r\nhope. I sent for many surgeons. The first that arrived was Maccione\r\nof Fossombrone, who dressed the wound with charmed bandages, a thing\r\nthat much displeased my brother; and for conscience-sake he refused\r\nto be doctored in that way, until persuaded by a friar, who assured\r\nhim there was no sin, seeing that there had been no diabolical\r\nincantation used; and, being told of numerous miracles effected by\r\nthese cloths, he submitted to them, and ere long was restored to\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\nThe sally-party from the garrison having been repulsed by Giraldi's\r\nsquadron, aided by a considerable force from Gubbio, Fossombrone,\r\nand Sinigaglia, which just then most opportunely appeared, they\r\nfound little safety by returning to quarters. The citizens still\r\nwithin the walls rushed to arms, even the women and children showered\r\nmissiles on the retreating soldiery, and the Bishop, dispirited by\r\nthe disaster, capitulated next day. But being seized with a panic,\r\nhis garrison withdrew ere their safe-conduct was signed, and were\r\nbeset by the infuriated troops and inhabitants, who attacked them on\r\nevery side with arms, bludgeons, and stones, slaying or capturing\r\nthem to a man. The Duke thus entered his capital, and was welcomed\r\nwith demonstrations of joy, only equalled by those which, fourteen\r\nyears before, had hailed his uncle's return in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nAs it was no easy task to restrain an army so composed from reaping\r\nthe spoils of victory in a way opposite to wishes and the interests\r\nof Francesco Maria, he lost no time in employing them against Fano,\r\na town which, not belonging to his state, might with less scruple\r\nbe abandoned to plunder. The assault, however, miscarried through\r\nMaldonato, a Spanish captain, whose treasonable correspondence with\r\nRome began already to be intercepted, and was ere long exposed.\r\nAfter this check, the troops were dispersed among the villages,\r\nuntil the inclement weather should pass; their head-quarters were at\r\nMontebaroccio, a very strong position midway between the upper part\r\nof the duchy, which acknowledged its legitimate sovereign, and the\r\ncities of Pesaro, Fano, and Sinigaglia, which were garrisoned by the\r\necclesiastical troops.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Pope, trusting to time more than the sword for ridding\r\nhim of an enemy destitute of all resources, had directed his nephew\r\nto leave them an open field, until his preparations for their\r\ndestruction should be complete. He hastily called upon the Emperor\r\nand the Kings of France and Spain for assistance, whilst Lorenzo was\r\nmustering the ecclesiastical and Florentine militia, under Guido\r\nRangone of Modena, Renzo da Ceri, and Vitello Vitelli. No expense\r\nwas spared from the papal treasury to raise an overwhelming force,\r\nand Lorenzo borrowed 50,000 golden florins from his fellow-citizens.\r\nCharles contributed four hundred Neapolitan lances, and Francis\r\npromised three hundred more, on condition of the surrender by Leo\r\nof Modena to his ally the Duke of Ferrara. By these means was\r\nlevied an army of fifteen to eighteen thousand infantry, a thousand\r\nmen-at-arms, and at least as many light cavalry, with fourteen pieces\r\nof artillery.\r\n\r\nThe Lord of Urbino appears to have looked without reason for\r\nreinforcements from Venice,[*270] but Minio mentions that his army\r\nnow consisted of twelve thousand foot, and that he had received a\r\nmoney subsidy from an unknown quarter, probably his father-in-law,\r\nthe Marquis of Mantua. Yet his position was in all respects critical.\r\nIn an enterprise depending on prompt success, each hour lost was the\r\nenemy's gain. His present life of bootless and bootyless inaction\r\ndisgusted his Spaniards, who not only murmured, but, unmindful of\r\ntheir vow of service, began to desert to the ecclesiastical camp,\r\nattracted by superior pay. Worst of all, the enthusiasm that had\r\nenabled Guidobaldo to win back his state for a brief interval,\r\nnow languished in the cause of his nephew, whose coup-de-main\r\nhad failed, and whose resources were inadequate to a prolonged\r\nstruggle, the burden whereof must fall upon his loyal subjects. In\r\nthese circumstances, he resorted to an expedient which relieved the\r\ndull incidents of a petty campaign by one of a novel and romantic\r\ncharacter. Hoping to bring the war to a speedy issue, he sent Suares\r\nde Lione, a Spanish officer, and his own Secretary, Orazio Florido,\r\nwith the following instructions, and message to his adversary:--\r\n\r\n     \"As it is creditable to a prince warring for any cause,\r\n     to endeavour that his object should be effected with the\r\n     least bloodshed and injury to the country, especially\r\n     if it be his intention to become its sovereign, and as\r\n     I conceive that the Lord Lorenzo must share in this\r\n     sentiment, I have devised an expedient most convenient\r\n     to both of us. For if he desire the acquisition of this\r\n     state as ardently as appears from the late and present\r\n     campaign, he will be delighted to satisfy that longing\r\n     promptly, and without further burden to its inhabitants, by\r\n     putting to the test his own bravery and that of his troops.\r\n     I therefore empower you, Captain Suares and Orazio, to\r\n     challenge him forthwith to combat in any place he likes;\r\n     four thousand men against four thousand, or three, two, or\r\n     one thousand, or five hundred, or one hundred, or twenty,\r\n     or four, or any smaller number he may choose, provided he\r\n     and I are included,--all to be on foot, with the usual arms\r\n     of infantry; or lastly, if he will fight me alone with the\r\n     readiest arms, so much the better, that thus, by the death\r\n     or imprisonment of one of us, the victor may obtain the\r\n     most satisfactory solution of his wishes, and relieve the\r\n     lingering suspense of not a few.\r\n\r\n     \"Relying on the courage of his Lordship, and many about\r\n     him of not less honourable pretensions, that these so\r\n     reasonable proposals will be received with pleasure, I\r\n     shall await your return, promptly to prepare for whatever\r\n     alternative he may accede to. I limit the answer to three\r\n     days; adding that, if he prefer fighting in considerable\r\n     numbers, he may do so with three hundred picked men of the\r\n     light cavalry, armed with lance, sword poignard, and mace.\r\n     Or, if none of the aforesaid conditions please him, which\r\n     I cannot believe possible, remember to offer that, if he\r\n     will engage with these three hundred light horse, and all\r\n     my infantry, he may have the advantage of five hundred or\r\n     a thousand foot beyond what I can bring into the field,\r\n     equally armed. And the present memorandum you will deliver\r\n     into his Lordship's hands.\"[271]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *270: It was against Venice that Leo had first, in March,\r\n1517, tried to get help.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, f. 141. It has been printed\r\nby Leone, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nThis step, natural to a gallant soldier of almost desperate fortunes,\r\nwith neither means nor inducement for a prolonged struggle, could\r\nhave no recommendation for his opponent, now at the head of an\r\noverwhelming force, backed by the papal treasury and the united\r\narms of most European powers. Lorenzo felt nettled at a proposal\r\nwhich it would have been folly to accept, but which could scarcely\r\nbe declined without incurring a slur; and, after answering that he\r\ncould entertain no such cartel until his challenger had evacuated\r\nthose places which he had forcibly seized, his temper showed itself\r\nby arresting its bearers, notwithstanding their safe-conduct.\r\nThe Spaniard was speedily released; but the secretary was sent\r\nto Volterra or Rome, to be disposed of by the Pope, where, with\r\nrevolting treachery and meanness, he was subjected to imprisonment\r\nand torture, in the hope of drawing from him the secrets of his\r\nmaster, whose vigorous resistance Leo strongly suspected to be backed\r\nby the French monarch.\r\n\r\nThe war was now carried on by manoeuvres and skirmishes, which have\r\nno interest beyond the light they throw on the spirit of this unequal\r\ncontest. Among the reinforcements that flocked to the papal standard\r\nwas an undisciplined band which crossed the Apennines from Tuscany,\r\ncarrying fire and sword through the highlands of Montefeltro. The\r\nDuke was unable to leave the low country exposed by marching in\r\nperson to the relief of his faithful mountaineers, but sent into\r\nthese defiles a squadron of light horse, who, falling upon the rabble\r\nat unawares, amply avenged their excesses. On the 25th of March, the\r\ninhabitants of Montebaroccio, having voluntarily admitted a body\r\nof papal troops, were visited by severe retribution as a warning\r\nto others; the place was sacked and burned by the Spaniards, seven\r\nhundred men and fifty old women being put to the sword,--a repulsive\r\ncomment upon the Duke's boast, that though the walls of his towns\r\nwere held for others, the hearts they contained were all his own.\r\nThese partial successes turned the tide of feeling somewhat more\r\nfavourably for the della Rovere cause, and we learn from the Minio\r\ndespatches, that the war, unpopular at Rome from the first, now\r\noccasioned great anxiety to the government, from the difficulty in\r\nraising funds to continue it. The Pope retired frequently to his\r\nvilla at La Magliana, less from the love of field sports, than to\r\nindulge his chagrin.[*272] Such were his straits for money, that he\r\ndeposited jewels in pawn with the Cardinal Riario, for a loan of 7000\r\nducats. This sum, with 5000 more, having been despatched to Pesaro\r\nin a convoy of waggons, was captured by the Duke, and along with it\r\nwere found certain letters, written in name of his Holiness, advising\r\nLorenzo, in the event of any suspicion attaching to the Gascons in\r\nhis service, either to ship them at once for Lombardy, or to have\r\nthem summarily massacred. These missives, having been circulated\r\nin the ecclesiastical camp, occasioned a prodigious ferment, and\r\nit was with the utmost difficulty that Lorenzo, by denying their\r\nauthenticity, induced the French troops to remain under his command,\r\nuntil an opportunity offered of conciliating them by the plunder of\r\nSta. Costanza.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *272: \"Gli pareva gran vergogna della Chiesa che ad un\r\nduchetto basti l'animo di fare questa novità; e il papa tremeva, ed\r\nera quasi fuor di sè.\" Cf. GIORGI, _Relazioni Venete_, 2nd\r\nseries, vol. III., p. 47.]\r\n\r\nAfter many complicated movements in the lower valley of the Metauro,\r\nattended with no decided advantage, and important only as having\r\nenabled the youthful Giovanni de' Medici to flesh that sword which\r\nsoon after won him the laurels of a bright but brief career, the\r\npapal army sat down before Mondolfo. The resistance of that small\r\ntown was encouraged by the state of the besiegers, and embittered by\r\ntheir savage reputation. The Minio despatches of this date represent\r\nthem as suffering from a scarcity of provisions and a dearth of bread\r\nand wine, adding that \"the captured castles envy the dead, by reason\r\nof the cruelties practised on the survivors.\" Its garrison consisted\r\nof two hundred Spaniards and three hundred militia, so determinedly\r\nsupported by the inhabitants, that breaches opened during the day\r\nwere made up before morning, mines were met by counter-excavations,\r\nand subterranean galleries were often scenes of death-struggles.\r\nProvoked by this obstinacy, Lorenzo swore never to raise the siege\r\nuntil he had razed the place to its foundations, put the males to the\r\nsword, and handed over the women to the Devil's service. But in the\r\nend of March, a few days after he had uttered this savage bravado,\r\nhis own career was arrested. Whilst, with more bravery than prudence,\r\nhe served a battery in the dress of a common soldier, a Spaniard, to\r\nwhom his person was known, marked him from the walls, and shot him as\r\nhe leaned upon a cannon to take aim. The ball took effect above the\r\nleft ear; and the wound extended down his neck to the shoulder.[273]\r\nHe was removed to Ancona, and for above a week continued in extreme\r\ndanger, refusing to be trepanned; but by the end of the month his\r\nconvalescence was complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: This account is adopted by Leone, p. 230, by Sismondi,\r\nand by Centenelle, Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 907. Baldi (Vat. Urb. MSS.\r\nNo. 906) and Guicciardini say that Lorenzo, having undergone much\r\npersonal fatigue at the battery, was walking away to repose himself\r\nin a sheltered spot, when a bullet from the walls hit him on the\r\nhead, grazing his skull to the nape of the neck.]\r\n\r\nThe Pontiff \"evinced extreme grief\" at so untoward an accession to\r\nthe mishaps of this ill-advised and unlucky campaign. It had hitherto\r\nbeen conducted by Renzo da Ceri and Vitellozzo Vitelli, who were\r\nsupposed to thwart the usurper from an apprehension that he might\r\nbecome another Cesare Borgia. The Cardinal de' Medici, however,\r\nattributed these successive miscarriages to the incapacity of Renzi,\r\nand seriously complained to the Venetian envoy that, in consequence\r\nof his reputation in the Signory's service, \"we engaged him for this\r\nundertaking, and don't perceive that he has effected anything. While\r\nhe commanded a small infantry force, he appeared never to be idle for\r\na day, yet, since he has been at the head of an entire army, he has\r\ncontrived to demean himself very ill, and to show that he is not a\r\nman of great exploits.\" It will be curious to find this very officer\r\nafterwards employed by the Cardinal when Pope, and fully bearing out\r\nthe mean opinion here expressed of him, when his present impugner had\r\nthe folly to instruct him with the defence of Rome itself.\r\n\r\nNeither the dissatisfaction of his subjects nor the coldness of his\r\nallies inclined Leo to abandon an enterprise which exhausted his\r\nresources and bathed Italy in civil blood. Thundering forth a new\r\nand more severe excommunication against Francesco Maria and his\r\nabettors, he, on the 30th of March, despatched a cardinal legate to\r\nthe camp, under whose command things went from bad to worse. The\r\ndefence of Mondolfo was protracted with extraordinary resolution.\r\nEven after a large space of wall had been thrown down by two mines,\r\nthe besiegers were kept at bay during ten hours of hard fighting,\r\nwhilst the women supplied missiles and coppers of boiling water, and\r\nthe priests, waving aloft their crucifixes, mingled absolution of\r\nthe dying with prayers for the survivors. This vain struggle against\r\nfearful odds ended in an ill-observed capitulation, in defiance\r\nof which the town was sacked and set on fire. Two incidents may\r\nillustrate the undisciplined state of the troops. Before entering\r\nthe place, two Spanish and a Ferrarese soldier agreed to share\r\nequally their respective booty. Whilst the Italian fought, his\r\ncomrades were plundering, and eventually refused to divide the spoil\r\naccording to stipulation, an evasion in which they were backed by\r\ntheir countrymen. The Ferrarese, with permission of his officers,\r\nchallenged his faithless partners, and a ring, or rather square,\r\nhaving been cleared, by tying together eight pikes, he sprang into\r\nit, armed but with sword and half-shield, offering to fight them\r\nboth at once, a proposal which they prudently evaded by surrendering\r\na just portion of their plunder. After the town had capitulated, \"a\r\nwrangle arose between an Italian and a German about a flagon of wine,\r\nthe former raising the shout of 'Italy! Italy!' the latter responding\r\n'Germany! Germany!' Whereupon the infantry came to blows, and many\r\nwere killed on either side; and when, at the peril of his life, the\r\nright reverend Cardinal had well nigh quelled the fray, an Italian\r\nstruck a German captain on the head with his musket and killed\r\nhim. This made the fight rage fiercer than ever, and the Spaniards\r\nhaving sided with the Germans, the Italians were routed, and all\r\ntheir quarters pillaged, including those of Signor Troilo Savello.\r\nThe army remains divided and dispersed; most of the Italians are\r\ndeparted, whilst the infantry have betaken themselves towards Fano,\r\nand continue thus separated.\" It is curious to detect in these and\r\nsimilar incidents[274] an undercurrent of national feeling, during\r\nthat dreary age when the Peninsula was torn into sections by communal\r\npolicy and dynastic ambition. Had that cry of _Italia! Italia!_ been\r\nthen raised by her leading spirits, with earnest good faith, apart\r\nfrom individual ends, how different had been her after fate and\r\npresent attitude!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: See above, p. 325.]\r\n\r\nThe legate, who thus, with difficulty and personal danger, averted\r\na general massacre, was the Cardinal Bibbiena, not de' Medici, as\r\naccidentally misstated by Roscoe. After long employing his diplomatic\r\ntalents against his former friend, the Lord of Urbino, he now\r\ncompassed his final ruin by exertions of the camp, for which he was\r\nless qualified. The mutinous _mêlée_ which he had witnessed prepared\r\nhim for the discovery, that moneys raised by extraordinary exertions\r\nwere ill-spent upon an army \"thrice as numerous on pay-day as in\r\naction.\" It was, therefore, to the commissariat and finance that\r\nhis chief attention was given; but, warned by the recent explosion\r\nof national antipathies, he separated the quarrelsome soldiery in\r\nvarious cantonments around Pesaro. The Italians garrisoned the\r\ncity and Rimini, the Spaniards were encamped on the adjoining\r\nMonte Bartolo, the Germans lay on the middle of that hill around\r\nthe Imperiale palace, the Corsi (Dalmatians) occupied the foot of\r\nit, and the Gascons bivouacked on the adjacent plain. The last of\r\nthese were in very bad repute at Rome; and finding themselves kept\r\nfor several weeks in that exposed situation, many deserted to the\r\ndella Rovere camp at Ginestreto, near Montebaroccio. After letting\r\nslip an apparently favourable opportunity for striking a blow at\r\nthese disorganised troops, Francesco Maria subsequently did so by a\r\nsurprise, which we shall narrate in his own words, addressed next\r\nmorning to the Duchess.\r\n\r\n     \"To the most illustrious Lady, my Consort, my lady Eleonora\r\n     di Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, &c.\r\n\r\n     \"Most illustrious Lady, my Consort,\r\n\r\n     \"Since the enemy took the field I have often wished to come\r\n     to action, and have used my ingenuity for this object,\r\n     little heeding their superiority to my brave band, both\r\n     in men-at-arms and in infantry, but all to no purpose.\r\n     At length, finding that his Reverence the Legate, Renzo\r\n     di Ceri, Vitelli, and their other principal leaders had\r\n     retired into Pesaro, with a host of men-at-arms, whilst\r\n     about three thousand foot, with the light horse and\r\n     the Gascon wings, lay on the road to Fano, the Spanish\r\n     lansquenets and the Corsi, to the number of at least six\r\n     thousand, being quartered in the Imperiale, there seemed a\r\n     chance of having at them. Accordingly, at half-past eleven\r\n     o'clock last night, on ascertaining their position, and the\r\n     most effective mode of attacking it, I advanced at the head\r\n     of my infantry and a detachment of cavalry. After passing\r\n     the Foglia, I sent the latter to a certain spot in the\r\n     plain, and, leading the rest by the hill-side to the summit\r\n     of the Imperiale, I charged the enemy about two hours after\r\n     daybreak, and, by God's grace and the gallantry of my men,\r\n     routed them ere they could form, killing, and taking many.\r\n     So sudden and vigorous was our onset over the rocks on the\r\n     seashore, that they were unable to gain their houses; and,\r\n     as we drove them with great loss over the hill, they were\r\n     intercepted below by my cavalry, so that between the two\r\n     few escaped. Some of the officers made their way into the\r\n     church of S. Bartolo, and into the palace of the Imperiale,\r\n     where they attempted to fortify themselves, but with a few\r\n     of my people I soon captured them all. We followed the\r\n     fugitives with great slaughter to the very gates of Pesaro,\r\n     the garrison of which, at least five thousand strong, would\r\n     neither support nor admit them, whilst the Gascons, though\r\n     witnessing the rout and drawn up in battle array, equally\r\n     withheld succour. Thus, without loss, we remained masters\r\n     of their camp, their colours, many prisoners, and all their\r\n     officers but two who were killed; and I, having taken up my\r\n     quarters here, hasten to inform your Excellency of these\r\n     particulars.\r\n\r\n     \"But I must not omit to tell your Ladyship how, three days\r\n     since, as Signor Troilo Savello, on his march from Rome\r\n     with fifteen hundred foot and some horse, was avoiding the\r\n     outpost at Sassoferrato, and attacking my castle of Sta.\r\n     Abonda, he was routed and rifled by a couple of hundred\r\n     infantry and a few cavalry from my garrison at Pergola, and\r\n     scarcely escaped being himself taken. In Montefeltro, too,\r\n     several incursions of the Florentines have been repulsed;\r\n     and between Massa and Lamole seven hundred of them, who had\r\n     taken post on a hill and in a very strong pass, were well\r\n     beaten and driven out of it by a hundred of my people.\r\n\r\n     \"I wished to give your Ladyship all these particulars,\r\n     that you may share with me the encouragement they afford\r\n     us. The favour which God has this morning vouchsafed us,\r\n     and for which our gratitude is due, gives me hope that\r\n     the justice of my cause will be daily advanced by new\r\n     successes; and so to your Ladyship do I commend myself:\r\n     from my joyous camp near Genestreto, 6 May, 1517.\r\n\r\n     \"_Consors_, FRANCISCUS MARIA DUX URBINI, &c. _ac\r\n     Alme Urbis Prefectus._\"[275]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Vat. Urb. MSS., No. 1023, art. vi.]\r\n\r\nTo this spirited despatch little remains to be added. The assailants\r\nascended from the Rimini side, leaving below a strong body of horse\r\nto cut off the fugitives. The troops being discouraged by the absence\r\nof Maldonato's Spaniards, who had straggled behind, and by the late\r\nhour at which, owing to blunders of their guides, they reached the\r\nmountain, the Duke encouraged them with assurances that the chances\r\nof success were greatest after daybreak, as the sentinels would\r\nbe less on the alert; and for an omen of victory, and a badge to\r\ndistinguish them from the enemy, he desired them to twine oak twigs,\r\nemblematic of his name, round their headgear. He led their file in\r\nperson; and after a complete victory was left with eight hundred\r\nprisoners on his hands, besides the entire camp equipage and much\r\nbooty. Next day the Gascons, who had not shared in the rout, came\r\nover in a body to Francesco Maria, headed by Monsieur d'Ambras, who\r\nreturned to the court of Francis I., after publicly declaring that\r\nhe would no longer permit his men to be sacrificed by officers that\r\ncould neither protect them nor annoy their enemy, but would leave\r\nthem under a prince whose tactics and discipline were a pattern even\r\nto his foes. This secession did not, however, prevent his master\r\nbolstering up the papal policy by loans of 100,000 livres Tournois\r\nto Lorenzo, and half that sum to the Pontiff, a course condemned by\r\nSismondi in his French history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n     Continuation of the ruinous contest--The Duke finally\r\n     abandons it--Death of Lorenzo de' Medici--Charles V.\r\n     elected Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time a serious conspiracy against Leo was discovered. The\r\nprime mover in it was Alfonso Petrucci, Cardinal of Siena, whose\r\nproperty having been confiscated, and his family ruined by the\r\nPontiff, he burned for revenge, and induced one Battista, a famous\r\nsurgeon of Vercelli, along with the Pope's valet, to enter into his\r\nviews. Leo being ill of fistula, it was arranged that Battista,\r\nwho had procured recommendations as a skilful operator, should\r\nintroduce poison into the dressings. The plot was revealed in time,\r\nand the Pontiff used every art, with promises of reconciliation and\r\nrenewed favour, to entice the principal culprit to Rome. Having\r\nwith difficulty effected this, he imprisoned him, along with his\r\nbrother-cardinals Raffaello Riario and Bandinello Bishop of Sauli,\r\nalong with the captain of the Sienese troops. Cardinal Alfonso was\r\nsecretly put to death; the surgeon and the valet were publicly hanged\r\nand quartered; Sauli, condemned to perpetual imprisonment, was\r\nliberated but to die; while Riario, after purchasing at a high rate\r\nrestoration to his escheated dignities, spent the brief remainder\r\nof his life in voluntary exile. Cardinals Soderini and Adriano of\r\nCorneto (the latter of whom held the sees of Hereford and Bath, and\r\nwas papal collector in England), having confessed in open consistory\r\ntheir privacy to the plot, escaped from Rome. The former was saved\r\nby chancing to ride out to the chase on a mule, instead of going as\r\nusual in his litter, which followed at some distance, and was seized\r\nby the guard in consequence of his scarlet robe being left in it,\r\nwhilst the culprit, in a simple chaplain's dress, fled to the Colonna\r\nstrongholds. A mystery which hung over the fate of Adriano has been\r\npartially cleared up by my friend Mr. Rawdon Brown from the Sanuto\r\nDiaries, wherein it appears that he safely reached Venice through\r\nCalabria, and that the occasion of his unaccountable disappearance\r\nwas a journey to the conclave on Leo's death, not his flight from\r\nRome in the present year, as stated by Guicciardini, Valeriano, and\r\nRoscoe.[276]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Vat. Urb. MSS., No. 907, f. 28, 30. The Minio\r\ndespatches are full of details of this conspiracy unknown to Roscoe.]\r\n\r\nThus baffled in the field, and betrayed in the consistory, Leo found\r\na great effort necessary. On the 20th of June he wrote a letter to\r\nHenry VIII., which has been published by Rymer, representing, in\r\nvague generalities, and abusive terms, the outrages committed against\r\nthe dignity and temporal dominion of the Church by relentless robbers\r\nand adversaries, and enjoining him to contribute assistance, in the\r\nway to be orally explained by the bearer, a predicant friar named\r\nNicholas.[277] He also made renewed instances with his other allies\r\nfor more efficient aid against his contumacious vassal in Umbria, and\r\nsent to levy six thousand Swiss. In order to raise money for these\r\nnew expenses, he, on the 26th of June, created thirty-one cardinals,\r\nthus at once filling his treasury with the price of their hats, and\r\nsurrounding himself by chosen adherents. Nor did he omit still more\r\nprofligate expedients. He had repeatedly profited by Maldonato's\r\nperfidy in the Urbino war, and now offered him 10,000 ducats, with\r\nthe dignity of cardinal to his son, if he would deliver up Francesco\r\nMaria alive or dead.[278]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: Rymer, vol. IV., p. 135. On the 21st of December\r\nLorenzo de' Medici had written to thank the King of England for his\r\ngood wishes conveyed through the Bishop of Worcester, then resident\r\nat Rome. See a curious letter of the following June, from Wolsey to\r\nthe usurping Duke, Appendix VI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Centenelle, Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 907.]\r\n\r\nAfter the affair at Imperiale, the Papal troops keeping close in\r\ntheir garrisons, Francesco Maria had recourse to a partisan warfare\r\nof sallies and surprises, which greatly harassed them, but did\r\nnot give sufficient employment to his own somewhat unmanageable\r\nlevies. He had now ascertained from intercepted letters the full\r\nextent of Maldonato's treason; but, ere he ventured upon making an\r\nexample, he thought it well to put his troops into good humour by\r\na foraging expedition, which should also free his own state from\r\ntheir burdensome presence. Gian Paolo Baglioni, Lord of Perugia,\r\nhad, during the whole campaign, been in the field against the Duke\r\nwith three thousand men, and his relation and rival Carlo, exiled by\r\nhis intrigues from that city, besought Francesco Maria's aid for his\r\nre-establishment. No proposal could have been more opportune, and the\r\nDuke drew all his forces towards the vale of Tiber.\r\n\r\nBut his army, disorganised by the intrigues of Maldonato and one\r\nSuares (not the bearer of his cartel), broke out into tumult at\r\nCantiano, clamouring for pay or pillage, and both of these officers,\r\nheading the mutiny, insulted and threatened their general. In this\r\npredicament, his adherents quickly collected from the neighbouring\r\nvillages some money, church plate, and other valuables, which brought\r\nthe refractory troops into better humour; and the opportune news of\r\nconsiderable booty having been obtained beyond the frontier, by the\r\nadvanced guard of Gascons, induced them to move upon the Pianello di\r\nPerugia. The Spanish troops whom the Duke had brought from Lombardy\r\nconsisted of two battalions, that of San Marco under Maldonato, and\r\nthat of Verona under Alverado. The disaffection was confined to a\r\nportion of the former, and had for some time been detected through\r\nintercepted correspondence of their officers. On the march through\r\nthe Apennines, Francesco Maria gradually prepared their comrades of\r\nVerona for the vengeance he had in store for the traitors. When all\r\nwas ready, he halted on a small plain, and, whilst the surrounding\r\ndefiles were being occupied by his staunchest adherents, he formed\r\nthe Spaniards into a square, with their officers in the middle, whom\r\nhe thus addressed: \"Gentlemen and Captains! You are aware how I\r\nentered this country under your protection, and how, in committing\r\nmyself into your hands, on your promise never in life or in death to\r\nabandon me, I relied upon your long-established reputation that you\r\nnever had betrayed any of your leaders. I now, however, find that\r\nsome among you seek miserably to sell me, and so for ever stain your\r\nhonourable name; and this I presently shall prove, if you think fit,\r\nwith the double object of saving myself from assassination and you\r\nfrom disgrace, but on condition that you shall at once take such\r\nsteps as you deem best adapted to rescue me from pressing peril,\r\nand yourselves from lasting contumely.\" This harangue, falling upon\r\nwell tutored ears, was answered by shouts of \"Death to the traitors!\r\nreveal them at once!\" Proofs were then read that Maldonato had\r\nengaged to slaughter the Duke and Federigo del Bozzolo, for the\r\nbribe of a life-pension to himself of 600 ducats, an episcopal see\r\nto his son, and double pay during the whole campaign to his troops.\r\nThere is said to be a standard of honour among thieves; that of the\r\nSpaniards was piqued by this melodramatic impeachment of their truth,\r\nand the opportune discovery of further treasonable documents in the\r\nbaggage of Maldonato's mistress exasperated them to fury. That craven\r\ncaptain threw himself at the feet of Francesco Maria, whom he had\r\nrecently insulted, and prayed for mercy; but the latter withdrew\r\nfrom the square, saying that he left the affair to the soldiery. A\r\ncry then arose, \"Let the faithful officers come out!\" They did so,\r\nleaving eight whose names had been denounced, and who were instantly\r\nmassacred by the troops. Thus was the army saved from destruction by\r\nthe coolness and decision of its leader, and the companies of San\r\nMarco and Verona, purged from the imputation of perfidy, were from\r\nthat day embodied in a single battalion.\r\n\r\nHaving so happily scotched the vipers that endangered his safety, the\r\nDuke of Urbino made his descent upon Perugia. After a short siege,\r\nduring which he extended his forays as far as Spoleto and Orvieto,\r\nspreading alarm to the gates of Rome, that city capitulated on the\r\n26th of May, receiving Carlo Baglioni as its master, and paying a\r\nransom of 10,000 scudi, which Vermiglioli, the biographer of Gian\r\nPaolo, alleges the latter, with the bad faith usual in that age,\r\nto have shared, although the money had been raised from his own\r\nadherents. The same authority now estimates the Duke's army at twelve\r\nthousand men, with which it was his intention to make a diversion\r\ninto the Florentine territory. But hearing that the Legate had taken\r\nthe field, he hurried back across the Apennines, though too late\r\nto save Fossombrone and La Pergola. His wish of engaging the enemy\r\nhaving been foiled by their retreat into Pesaro, he had recourse to\r\nhis former tactics of removing the seat of war from his own state,\r\nand turned his arms against the more wealthy towns of the Marca. Many\r\nof these, including Fabriano, Ancona, and Recanati, compounded for\r\nexemption from military violence, by paying seven or eight thousand\r\nducats each. Corinaldo was saved by a well-timed sally, but Jesi,\r\ncontrary to the wish of Francesco Maria, was sacked by his Spaniards,\r\nto whom his orderly and methodical way of laying the country under\r\ncontributions, and pillaging only the refractory, was far from\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe lesson he had given to these free lances appears for a time\r\nto have borne fruit, and the following report by Minio, of a\r\nconversation with the Pontiff, affords honourable testimony to their\r\nsteadiness, whilst it exhibits very graphically the character of the\r\ncontest at this juncture. \"I afterwards inquired of his Holiness if\r\nhe had any news? He told me Francesco Maria was encamped under a\r\ncastle named Corinaldo, situated in the Marca, and that infantry had\r\nbeen detached from his Holiness's army for its defence, so he hoped\r\nnot to be disappointed; a trust wherein I think the Pontiff will\r\nbe deceived, as he was regarding the other places. I said to him,\r\n'It is a good sign, his inability to make any further progress, and\r\nmerely laying siege to a few inconsiderable castles;' and to this\r\nhis Holiness rejoined, 'He does it to raise money, as he did by the\r\nother places.' He then told me that Don Ugo de Moncada had been with\r\nthe Spaniards, but was unable to make any settlement; adding, with an\r\nair of surprise, 'I was willing to give them three arrears of pay,\r\nyet they did not choose to come away, but despatched a friar to say\r\nthat should I undertake an expedition against the infidels, they are\r\nwilling to accept this offer, and serve.' I answered, that if so,\r\nthey were willing to fight against the infidels on the same terms\r\nfor which they now served Francesco Maria against the Holy See! The\r\nPope evinced little hope of an agreement with these Spaniards. On my\r\nobserving, 'The Viceroy [Don Ugo] has quitted Naples, we know not\r\nwherefore, unless it be to come to your Holiness's assistance,' he\r\nreplied, 'They do say they are coming to aid me;' and then continued,\r\nwith a smile on his lips, 'See what a mess this is! The French\r\nsuspect these Spaniards of playing them some trick, and the Spaniards\r\nfear lest the French, through Francesco Maria, should attack them in\r\nthe kingdom of Naples.' In order to elicit something more, I said\r\nthat I deemed it mere suspicion on either side; and he replied, 'It\r\nis so.' I next asked how his Holiness stood with the Swiss? and he\r\nanswered, 'We shall have the Grisons, but the Cantons have not yet\r\ndecided, though they were to do so in a diet; at all events, I shall\r\nhave some, and I have sent them the pensions they required of me.'\"\r\nOn the 14th of July, two days after this despatch, Minio reports that\r\nDon Ugo had been dismissed by the Spanish troops, drawn up in three\r\nfine battalions, with the following reply: \"That they did not intend\r\nto desert Francesco Maria, unless war were waged [by him] against\r\ntheir most Catholic King, or some attempt made to occupy the kingdom\r\nof Naples, or unless his Holiness shall commence hostilities against\r\nhis most Christian Majesty; in any other event they meant to keep\r\ntheir faith to Francesco Maria, and would in no respect fail him.\"\r\n\r\nFrom various passages in the same envoy's despatches, it is clear\r\nthat these jealousies, though here ridiculed by Leo, were shared by\r\nhimself in a high degree: his own policy being generally hollow and\r\nMachiavellian, he looked for no longer measure of good faith from\r\nhis allies. Ever since interest had been made at Bologna by Francis\r\nI. in behalf of the Duke of Urbino, the Pontiff regarded him as at\r\nheart adverse to all nepotic schemes upon that principality; and, at\r\nthis particular juncture, suspicion was strengthened by a variety\r\nof circumstances, singly of little moment. Among these, were the\r\nretention by his Holiness of Modena and Reggio; the apparent slight\r\nof passing, in the late wholesale distribution of cardinal's hats,\r\nover Ludovico Canossa, who, while legate in France, had gained the\r\nKing's affections, more perhaps than was approved at the Vatican;\r\nthe dilatory advance of those French lances long since promised\r\nto Lorenzo de' Medici; but most of all the adherence to the della\r\nRovere banner of the Gascons, who owed at least a nominal allegiance\r\nto the French crown. Influenced by these doubts, and the apparently\r\ninterminable expenses of this miserable and mismanaged contest, the\r\nPope so far lost heart, about the end of July, as to hint at an\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Urbino's next move was to repeat at Fermo his Perugian\r\npolicy of restoring an exiled faction, by expelling Ludovico\r\nFreducci, then head of the government, who after a gallant struggle\r\nsuffered a complete rout, with the loss of six hundred slain. The\r\nDuke then directed his march upon Ascoli, but was recalled by\r\nlearning the approach of two thousand Swiss to reinforce the papal\r\ntroops. Hurrying to intercept them, he by forced marches suddenly\r\nappeared near Rimini, where he found that, simultaneously with their\r\narrival, M. de l'Escu had at length brought up his three hundred\r\nFrench gens-d'-arms, with instructions from Francis to arrange,\r\nif possible, some issue to this unhappy war. Nor was the Legate\r\ndisinclined to the proposal, for the Pontiff had been playing a\r\nruinous game, which disgusted his allies, alienated his subjects, and\r\ndrained his treasury.\r\n\r\nAn interview was, therefore, held at the monastery of La Colonella,\r\nbetween the Duke, Cardinal Bibbiena, and the French captain. A\r\nguarantee of 10,000 ducats of income in any residence he should\r\nselect was offered to Francesco Maria, if he would resign his state.\r\nBut he declared himself ready to die rather than so to sell it\r\nand his honour, avowing, however, that if the Pope were resolved\r\nto deprive him of his sovereignty on account of the Cardinal's\r\nslaughter, he would abdicate in favour of his infant son, and carry\r\nhis army to Greece, to fight for the recovery of Constantinople. When\r\nnegotiations had been thus broken off, as described by Giraldi, the\r\nsmooth-tongued churchman, nothing abashed by the contrast of their\r\nearly familiarity with their present circumstances, invited him\r\nto partake of a splendid collation. This he courteously declined,\r\nand retired to breakfast with l'Escu, answering the Cardinal's\r\nremonstrances by a jesting but pungent remark, that \"priests kill\r\nwith wine-cups, soldiers with the sword.\" The Duke making somewhat\r\nminute inquiries as to the Swiss reinforcements, the Legate\r\nlaughingly asked, \"if he destined for them such a supper as he\r\nprovided for the Germans and Spaniards at the Imperiale\"; to which\r\nhe rejoined, \"And why not, if they are my foes?\"[279] Nor was the\r\ntaunt lost upon him. Next night he led his men through the Marecchia,\r\nand surprised the Swiss levies who were quartered in S. Giuliano,\r\na suburb of Rimini beyond that river. Notwithstanding a gallant\r\nresistance, they were driven into the stream, with severe loss on\r\nboth sides, whilst Francesco Maria, after receiving a ball in his\r\ncuirass, dexterously withdrew from his perilous position, under cover\r\nof the smoke raised by a vast funeral pile, on which he left the\r\nbodies of four hundred slain, amid a mass of combustibles. He now\r\nresumed his projects of carrying fire and sword into Tuscany, and\r\nreached the Upper Vale of the Tiber at Borgo S. Sepolcro, but, for\r\nwant of artillery, was unable to do anything against the fortified\r\nplaces. The Duke's whole policy in this protracted and inconclusive\r\nwarfare has been severely blamed by Roscoe, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat, in his circumstances, rapid and aggressive tactics were most\r\nlikely to succeed. Had he, by a series of uninterrupted advantages,\r\nmaintained the impression made at his first onset, or had he risked\r\nall in one engagement when his enemies had been daunted by Lorenzo's\r\nsevere wound, it is clear, from the Minio despatches, that Leo might\r\nhave been frightened into fair terms, at a moment when treason\r\nwas rife even within the Sacred College. The like result would,\r\nperhaps, have been attained with greater certainty, had he, instead\r\nof harassing his own territory and La Marca with an exhausting\r\ncivil war, carried his arms at once across the Apennines, and, by\r\nthreatening Siena or Florence, made it a question whether the Medici\r\nwere to lose Tuscany or gain Urbino. But we shall have ample reason,\r\nin other instances, to perceive that procrastination was more\r\nnatural to him than energy, and, in the present case, delays for a\r\ntime appeared injurious to his enemies rather than to himself. It is,\r\nhowever, fair to admit that, whilst his biographers continually claim\r\nfor him anxiety to bring on a decisive action, even the prejudiced\r\nGuicciardini never accuses him of having evaded one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: These anecdotes are preserved by Baldi, to whom, and\r\nto Minio Centenelle and Giraldi, we owe many new details of this\r\ncampaign. Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 906, 907; Ottob. 3153.]\r\n\r\nA general feeling gained ground that this weary and wasteful strife\r\nwas approaching its close. The Duke's mercenaries, seeing no\r\nprospect of their pay, which was contingent on complete success, and\r\ndissatisfied with their limited opportunities for pillage, began to\r\nlook out for some more profitable engagement. Their most Christian\r\nand most Catholic majesties had also combined to bring the struggle\r\nto a conclusion, by recalling their respective subjects from the\r\narmy of Francesco Maria; nor did the Spaniards think it a disgrace\r\nto entertain tempting offers for their secession from a cheerless\r\nenterprise. Three of their captains accordingly went to Rome, on the\r\n6th of August, apparently with his sanction, and offered for 60,000\r\nducats to place the whole state of Urbino in the hands of these two\r\nmonarchs, for their award as to which competitor should be preferred.\r\nThe Pontiff at first made a show of entertaining this proposition, in\r\nso far at least as regarded the duchy proper; but this was probably\r\na pretext for gaining time until the arrival of four thousand\r\nlansquenets, whom he expected from the Emperor. Accordingly, on the\r\n14th, in an audience with Minio, he denounced these terms as \"the\r\nmost brutal possible, nor could Francesco Maria send to demand of\r\nme what he does, were he the Grand Turk, and encamped at Tivoli!\r\nHe wants us to give him up the places we hold, namely, Pesaro and\r\nSinigaglia: see, by your faith, what notions he has! We really\r\ndesired this agreement, that we might attend to the Turkish affairs,\r\nbut these people are indeed elated and brutal.\" The like opinion\r\nprevailed at Rome, and the imperial ambassador deprecated the\r\narrangement to his Holiness as disgraceful. It was therefore rejected\r\nafter some delay; nor was it until the papal court had taken new\r\nalarm, on the Duke's movement into Tuscany, that the Spaniards were\r\nbought off by the auditor of the treasury, who had been sent for the\r\npurpose to their camp near Anghiari. He was met by the Duke, with\r\nhis faithful partisan di Bozzolo, and the Spanish captains. After a\r\nprotracted discussion, the former went forth, moved almost to tears,\r\nexclaiming, \"It is impossible for me to accept these terms.\" In his\r\nabsence it was agreed that the duchy should be given up to Lorenzo,\r\nand that the Spaniards should accompany Don Ugo de Moncada towards\r\nNaples, after receiving 50,000 ducats, under an obligation to serve\r\nin reinstating Lorenzo in Urbino, if called upon to do so.\r\n\r\nOn hearing these stipulations, Francesco Maria had an altercation\r\nwith the Spanish captains, which ended in his riding over to the\r\nquarters of his other adherents, who yet remained faithful, and who\r\nwere with difficulty dissuaded from falling upon the renegades. An\r\nidea now entertained, of making a last stand in the highlands with\r\nthat residue, was soon abandoned, for similar influences were at work\r\non them. But, mindful of their solemn obligation not to quit the\r\nfield until victory had crowned their enterprise, they resolved to\r\nretire with honour intact. The Gascons, accordingly, by the mediation\r\nof l'Escu and Guise, obtained from the Pontiff not only an exemption\r\nfrom their engagement, but such a capitulation for the Duke of\r\nUrbino as he might, with due regard to his dignity, accept. In order\r\nto persuade the latter to such a course as circumstances rendered\r\nnecessary, the entreaties of his friends were added to the pressing\r\ninstances of Don Ugo and the French generals. The French and German\r\ntroops, after receiving 25,000 ducats, were to fall back upon Milan,\r\nleaving him safely at Mantua; but the Italian soldiery appear to\r\nhave shared no part of this golden harvest.\r\n\r\nThe conditions obtained for Francesco Maria were as follows:\r\nPlenary absolution for himself, his family, and adherents, from\r\necclesiastical censures; permission to him and them to retire where\r\nthey pleased, and to take any service except against his Holiness;\r\nleave to remove all his private property in arms, artillery, and\r\nfurniture, especially his MS. library; the enjoyment of their\r\nusufructuary rights to the dowager and reigning Duchesses; a general\r\namnesty and exchange of prisoners, including Sigismondo Varana. This\r\nconvention was accepted by his Holiness on the 16th of September, and\r\nit fell to Bembo's lot, as papal secretary, to affix his signature\r\nto what he, perhaps, persuaded himself were favourable terms for his\r\nformer friend and benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Spaniards was regarded with universal contempt\r\nand disgust. As they withdrew towards the Neapolitan territory, a\r\nformidable band four or five thousand strong, the men of Gubbio stood\r\non their defence, but those of Fabriano, less alert, were surprised\r\nand pillaged to the value of 2000 scudi. \"But if the wretches sinned\r\nat Fabriano, they did penance at Ripatrasone; for, in trying to sack\r\nit also, many of them were slain, and the survivors were taken to\r\nGerbe, in Africa, where they nearly all died,--some from drinking too\r\nmuch, some from drinking too little. The former by great good luck\r\nwere drowned, and the latter, marching through that country in the\r\nparching summer heats, with water scarce, and no wine, perished of\r\nthirst; so that they had better have followed the Duke to marvellous\r\nenterprises and mighty gains, rather than have left to the world a\r\ndegraded name.\" There is something quaint in the concentrated rancour\r\nwherewith Giraldi thus dismisses these selfish adventurers; and not\r\nless so in the following rustic memorial. Grateful for their escape,\r\ncomparatively scathless, from perils which nearly menaced them, the\r\npeople of Maciola, a village two miles from Urbino, placed in their\r\nchurch a votive picture to the Madonna, which is still inscribed with\r\nthese simple verses:--\r\n\r\n     \"A horrible war [raged] in the state of Urbino,\r\n     In fifteen hundred and seventeen,\r\n     [With] many troops brave and chosen\r\n     Led by the Duke Lorenzino,\r\n     When Francesco Maria into his duchy\r\n     Was returned, with capital troops,\r\n     Spaniards, Mantuans, and other clans,\r\n     Each one a paladin in arms;\r\n     Urbino then, and all the district,\r\n     Being in great peril and dread.\r\n     Oh, Virgin Mother! ever kind to us,\r\n     Often did the host approach our walls,\r\n     And God alone it was who defended them:\r\n     Therefore has been dedicated to thee this image by thy worshippers\r\n     Of Maciola, with their grateful vows.\"\r\n\r\nIn the war thus concluded, Francesco Maria struggled for eight\r\nmonths, single-handed and penniless, against the temporal and\r\nspiritual influence of the Holy See, backed by all the continental\r\npowers. Unable to carry his object by a coup-de-main, he was in\r\nthe end vanquished by the superior resources of his oppressor.\r\nIn a parting address to his subjects, he assumed the tone of\r\nvictory, asserting that he withdrew, not under compulsion, but from\r\nconsideration of their interests, which a prolonged struggle must\r\nhave deeply compromised. Thus retiring with honour, he promised to\r\nreturn to them with glory, when he could do so without detriment to\r\ntheir welfare. He was escorted by l'Escu as far as Cento, whence he\r\nrejoined his family at Mantua, presenting his consort with sixty-four\r\nstandards, taken during this brief and unequal campaign, wherein his\r\ntalents had been developed, his character strengthened, his fame\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt somewhat minutely--it may be tediously--upon these\r\nevents, for the contest was one of vital moment to Francesco Maria,\r\nhis duchy being at once the theatre of operations and the guerdon\r\nof victory. Yet this petty war was pregnant with results of wider\r\ninterest; for the enormous drain of money it occasioned so aggravated\r\nthe financial difficulties of the papacy, as to bring to a crisis\r\nthose abuses which finally matured the Reformation. The Minio\r\ndespatches abound in proofs of the desperate state to which the\r\ntreasury was reduced, and of the simoniacal expedients resorted to\r\nfor ready money. One of these may be noted as compromising Bembo,\r\nwho so often re-appears in these pages. He and Sadoleto had, since\r\nLeo's accession, monopolised his private brieves, which afforded\r\nthem a handsome return, from gratuities and bribes, to the exclusion\r\nof the other papal secretaries. Now, however, the latter offered to\r\ntheir needy master a purse of 25,000 ducats, if admitted to share\r\nthe spoils, which was greedily accepted, without regard to vested\r\ninterests; and his Holiness was delighted to find the purchase-money\r\nof his ordinary secretaryships thereby raised at once from 6000 to\r\n7000 ducats each. The imposition of one tenth laid on the clergy,\r\navowedly for the proposed Turkish crusade, was absorbed by this\r\nUrbino campaign, which was thought to have cost the Holy See thirty\r\nthousand men, and a million of scudi. Even Henry VIII. was applied\r\nto for a loan of 200,000 ducats, which he characteristically evaded\r\nby offering 100,000, on condition of levying for himself the clergy\r\ntenths. But let us take the Pontiff's own statement, volunteered\r\nto Minio:--\"See, by your troth, what a business this is! The war\r\ncosts us 700,000 ducats; and we have been so ill served by these\r\nministers, that worse cannot be imagined: this very month we had to\r\ndisburse 120,000. When we commenced the war we had some few funds,\r\nwhich we had not chosen to touch, but the Lord God has aided us. We\r\nshould never have thought it possible to raise 100,000 ducats, and\r\nwe have obtained 700,000; see how astonishing this is! Had we deemed\r\nit possible to obtain 700,000 ducats, we would have undertaken the\r\nexpedition against the Turks single-handed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut where was the minion for whom all this crime and misery had\r\nbeen perpetrated? From Ancona he paid a brief visit to the Vatican,\r\non his way to Florence, where he slowly recovered from his severe\r\nwound, only to plunge deeper in debaucheries more congenial to his\r\ndegraded character than the privations of military life. He was\r\nnever named during the rest of the contest, but as soon as it was\r\nover he met his uncle at Viterbo, where, and in the neighbouring\r\ncountry, the papal court passed most of October in field sports. His\r\nhard-won sovereignty seems to have afforded him little satisfaction\r\nor interest; but in the following year he became an instrument\r\nfor the further promotion of his uncle's ambition. His marriage\r\nhaving been negotiated through Cardinal Bibbiena to Madelaine de la\r\nTour, daughter of Jean Count of Boulogne and Auvergne, a relation\r\nof the French monarch, the titular Duke of Urbino proceeded to\r\nParis in the spring of 1518, for the double ceremonial of his own\r\nnuptials, and the Dauphin's baptism, at which he stood sponsor on\r\nthe 25th of April, as proxy for the Pontiff. Both these events\r\nwere celebrated with much festive merriment in the gay capital of\r\nFrance, and the young couple were overwhelmed by splendid dowries\r\nand wedding-gifts by the Pope and the Monarch. But their bridal joy\r\nwas of brief duration. The Duchess died in childbed on the 23rd of\r\nApril following, and was followed to the grave five days after by\r\nher husband, who expiated with his life the dissolute vices in which\r\nhe had continuously indulged. Their child survived to be a scourge\r\nof the Huguenots, in the person of Catherine de' Medici, wife of\r\nHenry II. of France, mother of Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry\r\nIII.,--in the last of whom the line of Valois and the descendants of\r\nDuke Lorenzo became extinct.\r\n\r\nHearing of Lorenzo's desperate state, the Pope despatched Cardinal\r\nGiulio de' Medici to maintain at Florence the supremacy of his\r\nhouse. The titular dukedom of Urbino passed, in terms of the\r\nnew investiture, to the infant Catherine; but the territory was\r\nunceremoniously seized by his Holiness, notwithstanding the wish\r\nof its inhabitants for restoration of their legitimate sovereign.\r\nMontefeltro, with S. Leo and Maiuolo, was assigned to Florence, in\r\nsecurity or compensation for 150,000 scudi said to have been advanced\r\nin the late war, and the remainder of the duchy was annexed to\r\nthe Church. The walls of its capital, whose loyalty to its native\r\nprinces amid all their reverses is finely commemorated in the current\r\nappellation of _Urbino fidelissimo_, were thrown down, and its\r\nmetropolitan privileges transferred to Gubbio, which had shown itself\r\nless devoted to the della Rovere interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may here mention the fate of Gian Paolo Baglioni, known to us,\r\nin 1502, as one of the confederates of La Magione, who, in the\r\nquaint words of an unpublished chronicle, escaped the violin-string\r\nof Michelotto at Sinigaglia \"to fall into the pit which he had\r\ndigged.\" We have more lately seen him, in 1517, buying off Francesco\r\nMaria from the city of Perugia, with a bribe shared by himself, and\r\nhave at the same time alluded to the broils there raging between\r\nvarious members of his family. These it would be beyond our purpose\r\nto follow; but they were attended by a series of bad faith on his\r\npart, and of suffering on that of the people, which gained for him\r\nthe merited title of tyrant of Perugia. Less, perhaps, with the\r\nintention of vindicating the latter, than of liberating himself from\r\na talented and unscrupulous vassal, who, long accustomed to rule\r\nsupreme in that city, ill brooked and scarcely yielded that obedience\r\nto the Holy See which Julius II. had imposed on him in 1506, Leo\r\nsummoned Gian Paolo to Rome in 1520, with amicable professions. There\r\nhe arrived on the 16th of March, and next day sought an audience of\r\nthe Pontiff in S. Angelo, the gates of which were immediately closed\r\nupon him as a state prisoner. After he had lingered for some months\r\nin mysterious durance, unconscious of the charge brought against him,\r\na plan was formed to liberate him, disguised as a woman who visited\r\nthe castellan; but at that juncture the Pope, who, according to the\r\ngossip of a contemporary diarist, had dreamt at La Magliana of a\r\nmouse escaping from a trap, sent a summary order for his execution,\r\nwhich took place secretly on the 11th of June.\r\n\r\nThe singular good fortune which accumulated coronets and crowns\r\non the brows of Charles V., until he found himself sovereign by\r\ninheritance of a large portion of Europe, here demands our notice.\r\nThe Emperor Maximilian had, by Mary, daughter and heiress of Charles\r\nthe Bold, Duke of Burgundy, a son Philip, who predeceased him in\r\n1506, after marrying Joanna, daughter and heiress of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella of Aragon and Castile. Joanna being disqualified\r\nby mental imbecility, the united crowns of Spain devolved, on\r\nthe death of Ferdinand in 1516, to her son Charles, who already\r\nheld the Netherlands through his grandmother, Mary of Burgundy.\r\nAs representative of the house of Aragon, he was also sovereign\r\nof Naples and Sicily; but the former crown required the papal\r\ninvestiture, which Leo was loath to bestow, partly with a vague\r\nhope of reserving it for one of his own race, partly from aversion\r\nto the establishment of a new line of foreign rulers in the Italian\r\npeninsula. On the death of Maximilian in January 1519, without\r\nhaving formerly received the imperial crown, his grandson, Charles,\r\nstepped into Austria, as his natural heritage, and sought still\r\nfurther aggrandisement by offering himself candidate for the throne\r\nof Germany. Little as the balance of power was then comprehended in\r\nEuropean policy, this young monarch's rapid acquisitions called forth\r\nmany jealousies. Francis had a double motive for standing forward\r\nas a competitor for the empire;--the dignity was flattering to his\r\ngallant character and ambitious views, and he grudged it to a younger\r\nrival, whose overgrown territory already hemmed him in on every side.\r\nLeo, at heart disliking them equally, as ultramontane sovereigns\r\nformidable to Italy, on the ruins of whose freedom were based the\r\nsuccesses of either, sought to play them off against each other, so\r\nas to weaken and embarrass both. But in spite of these intrigues,\r\nCharles was elected emperor on the 28th of June, 1519, when but\r\nnineteen years of age.\r\n\r\nThe Pope had covertly supported the claims of Francis, with whom he\r\nintended some ulterior combination for expelling the Spaniards from\r\nLower Italy. But the accession of strength which their sovereign thus\r\nacquired gave Leo an excuse for changing sides, an evolution grateful\r\nto his faithless nature. The struggle was once more to be made in\r\nLombardy, and, as Charles was bent upon wresting the Milanese from\r\nhis rival, the opportunity seemed tempting of recovering Parma and\r\nPiacenza for the Church by his means. To men in the Duke of Urbino's\r\ndesperate position, any convulsion would be welcome, as offering the\r\nchance of better things. The impression left by his biographers, that\r\nhe maintained a cautious neutrality in the contest thus opening,\r\nis disproved by some documents in the Bibliothèque du Roi, which\r\nestablish him as a retained adherent of the French monarch.[280]\r\nOne of them is an undated draft of articles proposed by him, his\r\nnephew Sigismondo Varana, Camillo Orsini, the Baglioni, and the\r\nPetrucci, as conditions of their entering the service of Francis,\r\nwith the usual pay and allowances. They stipulated for his constant\r\nprotection and support in the recovery of their respective states,\r\nand for the restoration of various allodial fiefs claimed by them\r\nin Naples, as soon as Francis should, with their aid, regain that\r\nkingdom. Francesco Maria, finding it necessary to quit the territory\r\nof his brother-in-law Federigo, now Duke of Mantua, who had been\r\nnamed captain-general of the ecclesiastical forces, and to surrender\r\nthe allowance of 3000 scudi, hitherto made by him for the Duchess's\r\nmaintenance, asked a pension of equal amount from his new ally,\r\ntogether with 1500 scudi in hand, to meet the expense of removing\r\nhis family to a place of security, probably Goito. He accompanied\r\nthese overtures with a plan for very extended operations upon Central\r\nItaly, whereby, with the assistance of Venice and Genoa, armaments\r\nby sea and land were to be directed in overwhelming force, at once\r\nagainst Tuscany and the Papal States. The result of this negotiation\r\ndoes not appear, but the only one of its provisions which seems to\r\nhave taken effect was the Duke's pension, for which he writes thanks\r\nto the French Monarch from the camp of Lautrec on the Taro, the 27th\r\nof September, 1521. Giraldi mentions that he suddenly quitted the\r\nFrench service in consequence of a slight from Lautrec at a council\r\nof war, and he appears then to have retired to Lonno on the Lago\r\ndi Guarda. From that lovely spot he watched the course of events,\r\nuntil the wheel of fortune should bring round his turn. The ladies\r\nof his family meanwhile lived in great seclusion at Mantua, and on\r\nthe 19th of July, 1521, the dowager Duchess writes him, that she\r\nand his consort frequented the convents, soliciting from the nuns\r\ntheir prayers that God would direct his counsels, and vouchsafe\r\nthe fulfilment of his wishes.[281] As the strife approached, these\r\ndistinguished ladies withdrew to Verona. Upon its progress we need\r\nnot dwell. By his oppressive sway Lautrec had rendered the French\r\nname odious at Milan, and when the confederate army approached its\r\nwalls, bringing with them Francesco Sforza, second son of Ludovico\r\nil Moro, and brother of Maximiliano their last native sovereign, the\r\npeople hailed them as liberators, and expelled their foreign masters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: MOLINI, _Documenti di Storia Italiana_, I.,\r\npp. 122, 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: Oliveriana MSS.

Though not quite well, he hurried to his capital on the\r\n24th of November, to witness the bonfires and rejoicings at their\r\ndiscomfiture, and on the morning of the 1st of December was found\r\ndead in bed.[*282] The mystery attending this sudden death of one in\r\nthe prime of life has never been cleared up. Suspicions of poison\r\nwere rife at the time, and have not been removed; they point at\r\nthe Duke of Urbino or of Ferrara, whom he had grievously outraged,\r\nor at Francis I., whom he recently disgusted, as its probable but\r\nundetected author. In absence of tangible accusation or tittle of\r\nevidence, it seems needless to repel such a charge from Francesco\r\nMaria, especially as other accounts impute the Pontiff's dissolution\r\nto malaria fever, to a severe catarrh,[283] to debauchery, or even\r\nto excessive exultation at the joyful news. So unexpected was the\r\nevent that there was not time to administer the last sacrament, a\r\ncircumstance which gave occasion to this bitter epigram, in allusion\r\nto the notorious venality of church privileges during his reign:--\r\n\r\n     \"Why were not Leo's latest hours consoled\r\n     By holy rites? such rites he long had sold.\"[284]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *282: He seems to have received the news at La Magliana\r\non November 25th. He returned to Rome at once. The illness was not\r\nconsidered serious till November 30th. He died on the evening of\r\nDecember 1st. Cf. PARIS DE GRASSIS, in ROSCOE, _Leo X._, App.\r\nCCXII.-IV., and clerk's letters of December 1st and 2nd, in BREWER,\r\n_Calendar_ (1824-5).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: Such is the opinion of a monkish chronicler who wrote\r\nin 1522. Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 1023, f. 297. Even in 1517 the Venetian\r\nenvoy Giorgi reported him as afflicted by an internal plethoric\r\ndisease, a catarrh, and fistula. Vettori discredits the rumours of\r\npoison, and Guicciardini says they were hushed up by his cousin the\r\nCardinal, lest they should give umbrage to the French monarch, with\r\nwhom it was his interest to stand well at the approaching conclave.\r\nOn the whole, the opinion of most weight is that of the Master of\r\nceremonies, who distinctly asserts that poison was detected on a\r\n_post-mortem_ examination. Roscoe's innuendo inculpating Francesco\r\nMaria is a glaring proof of his aptitude to do scanty justice to that\r\nDuke, whose admitted hastiness of temper cannot, in absence of one\r\ncontemporary or serious imputation, be considered any relevant ground\r\nfor suspecting him of slow and stealthy vengeance. Another Venetian\r\nambassador mentions, in proof of the utter exhaustion of the papal\r\ntreasury, from the profusion of Leo and the greed of his Florentine\r\nretainers, that the wax lights used at his funeral had previously\r\nserved for the obsequies of a cardinal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284:\r\n\r\n     \"Sacra sub extrema si forte requiritis hora\r\n     Cur Leo non potuit sumere? vendiderat.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bibl. Magliabech. MSS._, cl. vii., No. 345.]\r\n\r\nTidings so momentous to Francesco Maria reached him when on a visit\r\nto the Benedictine monastery at Magusano, on the Lago di Garda. He\r\nhad audience on the same day with Lautrec and Gritti, the French and\r\nVenetian commanders, who bade him God-speed. Hurrying to his consort\r\nat Verona, he there spent two days in consulting with such friends\r\nas were at hand, and despatching courtiers to others, his resolution\r\nbeing taken to strike a speedy blow for recovery of his state. The\r\nimpoverished finances of the papacy encouraged the attempt, and he\r\nwas quickly in communication with Malatesta and Orazio Baglioni, who\r\nhad been in like manner despoiled of Perugia. But before assuming\r\noffensive operations, he commissioned a special envoy to lay before\r\nthe conclave a statement of his grievances, and a justification of\r\nthe measures he was about to pursue.[285] In two days more he reached\r\nFerrara, with the Baglioni, at the head of three thousand foot and\r\nabove five hundred horse. On the 16th he was at Lugo, where, and all\r\nalong his route by Cesena, numerous reinforcements poured in. \"His\r\nsubjects,\" to borrow the words of Muratori, \"desired and expected\r\nhim with clasped hands, because they loved him beyond measure for\r\nhis gracious government.\" Anticipating a renewal of his \"Saturnian\r\nreign,\" they, on his approach, flew to arms, threw the lieutenant of\r\nUrbino out of the palace window, and welcomed him with the well-known\r\ncry of \"Feltro! Feltro! the Duke! the Duke!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 921.]\r\n\r\nPesaro received him on the 22nd, after a slight hesitation as to\r\ntheir relations with the Church; but the citadel was held by eighty\r\nmen, there being no artillery at hand to bring against it. In\r\nabsence of cannon-balls, it was carried by paper pellets thrown in\r\nfrom cross-bows, on which were written offers of a thousand scudi\r\nto the castellan, and twenty-five to each soldier. The terms were\r\naccepted, and the money advanced by Alfonso of Ferrara. On the day of\r\nthe Duke's arrival there, a deputation from Urbino laid its homage\r\nat his feet, and, being thus secure of his own subjects, he turned\r\nto succour his friends. Taught by the lesson of three successive\r\npontificates, whose policy it had been to crush the feudatories of\r\nUmbria, he saw the necessity of making common cause with such of\r\nthese as still maintained a precarious independence. He therefore\r\nundertook the re-establishment of his nephew, Sigismondo Varana,\r\nand of the Baglioni, ere he devoted himself to the consolidation\r\nof his own authority. After two days' repose in Pesaro, he marched\r\nby La Pergola to Fabriano, where, hearing that Sigismondo had been\r\ncordially received at Camerino, he, on the 28th, turned towards\r\nPerugia, and, by the 5th of January, had reinstated the Baglioni,\r\nnotwithstanding a spiritless resistance by their uncle Gentile, and\r\nby the vacillating Vitelli. Contrary to his own judgment,--but, as we\r\nshall presently see, by a happy chance,--he was induced to accompany\r\nhis Perugian allies with seven thousand men in a foray upon Tuscany,\r\nfor the double purpose of annoying the Medici, by whom Gentile was\r\nsupported, and of re-establishing Pandolfo Petrucci as tyrant of\r\nSiena.[*286] When, however, he found no responding movement from\r\nwithin, and that the army of Giovanni delle Bande Nere was hovering\r\nin the neighbourhood, he withdrew to Bonconvento, and endeavoured to\r\ngain credit for his forbearance by despatching to the magistracy of\r\nthat city the following oily missive:--\r\n\r\n     \"Most illustrious and most excellent Lords, much honoured\r\n     Fathers:\r\n\r\n     \"The true, ancient, and cordial friendship which has ever\r\n     existed between your lofty republic and my most illustrious\r\n     house, and the recollection I retain how invariably my\r\n     distinguished predecessors have been united in special\r\n     good-will with your city of Siena, induce me, being of the\r\n     same sentiments, to follow in the steps of my said most\r\n     eminent ancestors, resolving that there shall never be\r\n     any failure on my part towards your noble commonwealth.\r\n     And in order that your Excellencies may at present have\r\n     some proof of this, I have, for the peace and order of\r\n     your town, adopted the resolution which your envoys will\r\n     comprehend from the tenor hereof, and which I feel assured\r\n     cannot be otherwise than welcome and acceptable to you.\r\n     I therefore pray you not only readily to give the like\r\n     credence to what these envoys will tell you on my part, as\r\n     you would to myself, but also to bear in mind the close and\r\n     affectionate amity wherein I am most ready to persevere,\r\n     nor on your side restrain or fall short of our wonted and\r\n     long-established kindliness, increasing, and, if possible,\r\n     extending it by an ampler interchange of charity; for you\r\n     will assuredly ever find me prepared and ready to benefit\r\n     and uphold your republic as much as your Excellencies could\r\n     ever desire, to whom I offer and commend myself. From\r\n     Bonconvento, the 15th of January, 1522.\r\n\r\n     \"FRANCISCUS MARIA DUX URBINI.\"[287]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *286: Fabio, not Pandolfo Petrucci. The latter died at S.\r\nQuirico, in Osenna, in May, 1512. Borghese Petrucci, his son, soon\r\nbecame the \"best hated man in Siena.\" Four years after his father's\r\ndeath both he and Fabio were declared rebels. Leo X. put Raffaello\r\nPetrucci in Borghese's place. Raffaello died in 1522, and then some\r\nof the _Nove_ brought back Fabio, who had married Caterina de'\r\nMedici, niece of the Pope. But after a rule of less than two years he\r\nwas again an exile. \"Thus,\" says Ferrari, \"the Petrucci returned to\r\ntheir primitive obscurity.\" Cf. LANGTON DOUGLAS, _A History\r\nof Siena_ (Murray, 1902), p. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: From the Italian original in the Archivio Diplomatico\r\nat Siena.]\r\n\r\nIn truth, the Duke's own affairs required his full attention, for the\r\npower of the Medici, though shaken, was still formidable, and its\r\nnatural representative, the Cardinal Giulio, was influential in the\r\nSacred College, and almost sovereign at Florence. Francesco Maria\r\ntherefore observed a prudent neutrality, when the Bande Nere advanced\r\nto support the claims of Gentile Baglioni upon Perugia. These, being\r\nwarned off the ecclesiastical territory by the consistory, turned up\r\nthe valley of the Tiber, and, passing the Apennines, made a descent\r\nupon Montefeltro, where they plundered until the end of February,--an\r\noutrage for which the Cardinal was greatly blamed, as a convention\r\nhad already been signed between him and the Duke for their respective\r\nstates of Florence and Urbino. Much light is thrown upon these very\r\ncomplicated transactions by a careful examination of Castiglione's\r\nletters. To his dexterous diplomacy that convention seems to have\r\nbeen chiefly owing. He endeavoured to clench the reconciliation by\r\nan engagement for Francesco Maria in the Florentine service, and a\r\nmarriage between Prince Guidobaldo of Urbino and Caterina de' Medici,\r\ndaughter of Lorenzo, and heiress of his pretensions. The failure of\r\nthis plan, from backwardness on the part of the Cardinal rather than\r\nof the Duke, was, perhaps, fortunate for the intended bridegroom's\r\ndomestic peace; and the contending claims which it was meant to\r\nsolve never ripened into importance. The condotta had a better issue:\r\navowedly for but one year, it seems to have been intended rather to\r\nneutralise a troublesome foe than with the idea of calling the Duke's\r\nservice into actual requisition. Indeed, although he was nominally\r\ncaptain-general, with 9000 ducats of pay, besides 100 broad scudi for\r\neach of his two hundred men-at-arms in white uniform (three mounted\r\nsoldiers counting as one man-at-arms), this was expressly their\r\npeace establishment and pay, to be increased in case of war.[288]\r\nCastiglione's success in these arrangements was facilitated by\r\nhis having confided to Cardinal Giulio a refusal at this time, by\r\nFrancesco Maria, of very flattering proposals from the French court,\r\nand the same good offices extended to disabusing the Duke in the eyes\r\nof Emanuel, the imperial ambassador, who, believing him committed to\r\nFrancis, was countermining his interests in the consistory, and with\r\nthe Cardinal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: Archivio Diplomatico of Florence, May 25, 1522.]\r\n\r\nWhilst immersed in these transactions, the election in which he was\r\nso deeply interested came suddenly to a conclusion, brought about\r\nindirectly by his means. The choice of the conclave astonished\r\nItaly, for it fell upon an ultramontane cardinal, unknowing and\r\nunknown in Rome. Adrian Florent,[*289] a Fleming of humble birth,\r\nwas a man of mild temper, peaceful habits, and literary tastes. He\r\nhad been preceptor of Charles V., and held the see of Tortosa. This\r\nselection so curiously illustrates the haphazard results, which\r\nhave not unfrequently baffled both policy and intrigue in papal\r\nelections, that we may pause for a moment on the circumstances\r\nalleged by Guicciardini to have brought it about. The Medicean party\r\nhad not strength, at once, to carry their Cardinal, in the face of\r\nthe old members of the College, who were adverse from introducing\r\nthe hereditary principle into their selection, yet hoped in time to\r\nexhaust the patience or the strength of their seniors. But whilst\r\nMedici and Petrucci were thus ingeniously devising delays, news\r\nreached them of the Duke of Urbino's descent upon Tuscany, causing\r\nthem respectively to tremble for their supremacy in Florence and\r\nSiena, and to question the policy of procrastinating at the Quirinal,\r\nwhilst interests so momentous were elsewhere in peril. In this\r\nstate of matters the Cardinal of Tortosa \"was proposed, without any\r\nintention of choosing him, but that the morning might be wasted;\r\nwhereupon his eminence of San Sisto, in an endless oration, enlarged\r\nupon his virtues and learning, until some of the members beginning to\r\naccede, the others successively followed with more impetuosity than\r\ndeliberation, whereby he was unanimously then chosen Pope. The very\r\nelectors could allege no reason why, at a crisis of such convulsions\r\nand perils for the papacy, they had selected a barbarian pontiff,\r\nso long absent, and recommended neither by previous deserts, nor by\r\nintimacy with any of the conclave, to whom he was scarcely known by\r\nname, having never visited Italy, nor had he any wish or hope to do\r\nso.\"[290] The Roman populace resented a choice which they felt as an\r\ninsult, and as the cardinals emerged from durance, they were assailed\r\nby execrations of the mob.[*291]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *289: Adrian Floriszoon, the son of a ship's carpenter\r\nnamed Floris. His education was chiefly theological; humanism had not\r\npenetrated Louvain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: Guicciardini, lib. xiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *291: This account of Adrian VI.'s conclave is inaccurate\r\nand confused. Cf. CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol. VI., pp. 216-222. The\r\nDuke of Urbino seems to have had no influence in the conclave.]\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria had every reason to be gratified by an election\r\nhe had most unwittingly influenced, for the exclusion of Cardinal\r\nGiulio was of vast importance to his interests, which must have\r\nbeen seriously compromised by the nomination of a hostile pontiff,\r\nat a moment when his affairs were in so precarious a juncture. He\r\naccordingly lost no time in accrediting to Adrian VI. in Spain,\r\nan envoy who pleaded his cause to such good purpose, that a bull\r\nwas issued on the 18th of May, reinstating him in all his honours,\r\nincluding the prefecture of Rome, which, on the death of Lorenzo,\r\nhad been conferred upon Giovanni Maria Varana, uncle of Sigismondo,\r\nwhose state he had usurped under the sanction of Leo. Meanwhile his\r\nrespectful and judicious demeanour had obtained from the Sacred\r\nCollege, before the Pope's arrival, an acknowledgment of his rights,\r\nupon the following conditions, dated at Rome, the 18th of February.\r\n\"The Lord Duke of Urbino promises to accept neither pay, engagement,\r\nnor rank from any prince or power, and to take service only with the\r\nApostolic See, should he be required; but if not called upon by it,\r\nto attach himself to no party without leave and sanction from the\r\nPope, and the Holy See, as represented _ad interim_ by the Sacred\r\nCollege. Also, he renews his obligation in future never to oppose\r\nthe papal state; and further, for due observance of these terms, and\r\nmore ample assurance of his Holiness and the Apostolic See, he binds\r\nhimself within one month to deposit his only son as a hostage, in the\r\nhands of the Marquis of Mantua, captain-general of the ecclesiastical\r\ntroops. On the other hand, the Sacred College undertakes to defend\r\nand protect the Lord Duke's person, as well as to maintain him in\r\npeaceful possession of the castles, fortresses, cities, and towns,\r\nheld by him now or before his deprivation; and further, to use\r\ninfluence with our Lord the Pope for his reinvestment in the same, on\r\nthe terms of his former tenure.\"[292]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: These articles are to be found in the Archivio\r\nDiplomatico at Florence.]\r\n\r\nNor was it only from the Medicean faction that the Duke's\r\ntranquillity was threatened. Whilst his fortunes were yet in\r\nsuspense, he was warned by Castiglione, then diplomatic resident\r\nat Rome for his brother-in-law the Duke of Mantua, that Ascanio\r\nColonna was agitating certain vague pretensions on the duchy of\r\nUrbino, through his mother Agnesina di Montefeltro. The nature of\r\nthese claims, which were from time to time revived, is not very\r\nintelligible. All authorities make Giovanna, wife of the Prefect,\r\nolder than Agnesina, wife of Fabrizio Colonna, both being daughters\r\nof Duke Federigo. Thus, even supposing Francesco Maria's title\r\nirretrievably annulled, by the deprivations he had successively\r\nsustained from Julius II. and Leo X., if the old investitures did\r\nconfer any rights upon females, his nephew Sigismondo Varana,\r\ngrandson of Giovanna, would have excluded the Colonna. Ascanio's\r\nintrigues were, however, neutralised by the dexterity of Castiglione,\r\nand the influence of the Duke of Mantua, until Francesco Maria's\r\ncordial reconciliation with the Church and the Emperor had rendered\r\nhis position secure.[293] Even the Medici thereupon refused to\r\npromote the pretender's views, and his only adherent was Gian Maria\r\nVarana, who, having within a few weeks succeeded in recovering\r\npossession of Camerino, sought so to occupy the Duke of Urbino as to\r\nprevent his espousing the cause of Sigismondo, its rightful lord.\r\nThe latter also looked for support to his wife's uncle, Cardinal\r\nProspero Colonna, whilst the interests of his competitor were backed\r\nby Cardinal Innocenzo Cibò, his brother-in-law. But ere these\r\nrespective claims could be tested, they were sadly set at rest by\r\nthe death of \"poor dear but ill-starred Sigismondo,\" as he is called\r\nby Castiglione, who was set upon and slain on the 24th of June by\r\na band of assassins, whilst riding with five attendants near La\r\nStorta. This foul deed, in accordance with the wild habits of that\r\nage, and the fratricidal tendencies of the Varana family, was imputed\r\nto Ascanio Colonna at the instigation of Giovanni Maria, uncle of the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: However these pretensions may have originated, they\r\nderived a _quasi_ warrant in 1525, from a conditional investiture of\r\nthe duchy for three generations, granted by Clement VII. to Ascanio\r\n\"in case it should happen to lapse to the Holy See,\" Agnesina being\r\nthere mentioned as eldest sister. Charles V. was vainly solicited by\r\nAscanio to render this condition eventual, or by some other means\r\nto make good his possession, and the claim did not drop until 1530.\r\nNor was it the only one vamped up on account of Duke Guidobaldo's\r\nunfruitful marriage. In 1505 the Prince of Salerno seems to have made\r\nsimilar pretensions through his mother, a sister still younger than\r\nAgnesina; and in order to dispose of these, Julius II. is said to\r\nhave offered him his own daughter Felice, a union which however did\r\nnot take place.]\r\n\r\nWhen reassured of pacific and equitable measures, Francesco Maria\r\ndissolved a defensive league for mutual maintenance, which he had\r\nformed on the 4th of March with the Baglioni, Sigismondo, and the\r\nOrsini, to which the Cardinal de' Medici was a party. The strongholds\r\nof S. Leo and Maiuolo, however, remained till 1527 in the hands of\r\nthe Florentines, mortgaged for their advances to Leo in the late\r\nwar. During these complex negotiations, an offer from Lautrec of\r\nservice under the lilies of France was declined by the Duke, on a\r\nplea of reserving himself for the disposal of his ecclesiastical\r\noverlord. Nor was the opportunity he looked for long delayed.\r\nPandolfo Malatesta, on ceding to Venice his pretensions upon Rimini,\r\nafter being expelled therefrom by Duke Valentino, had accepted from\r\nthat republic the castle of Cittadella near Padua, with large pay\r\nin their service. His son Sigismondo availed himself of the Pope's\r\nabsence, and the unsettled ecclesiastical policy, to surprise Rimini\r\nand its fortress towards the end of May. The consistory hastily\r\nmustered all their means to meet the emergency, and called upon the\r\nDuke of Urbino as their vassal to take the field. His answer was that\r\nwithout money he could do nothing. About the beginning of August\r\nthe _rocca_ was retaken by Giovanni Gonzaga for the Church; but the\r\nplace was not finally recovered till Adrian sent thither some Spanish\r\ntroops, when the people at length rose, and drove out the interloper,\r\nwhose cruelties had alienated all his supporters. In this paltry\r\nfray the Duke appears to have lent some trifling aid, which the\r\nPontiff gratefully acknowledged in writing to Leonora on the 24th of\r\nDecember. When it was over, he turned to the internal affairs of his\r\nduchy, disorganised by the long and severe struggle of which it had\r\nbeen the scene. In the spring of 1523 he brought home the ladies of\r\nhis family\r\n\r\n     \"Into their wished haven\";\r\n\r\nbut of their once lively court we have little to record. Much had\r\noccurred to chasten the naturally staid temperament of Duchess\r\nLeonora. Retrenchment was imperatively imposed by accumulated\r\ndebts and dilapidated finances: the brilliant assemblage which had\r\nfrequented the saloons of Urbino seventeen years before was thinned\r\nby death, scattered by dire events, alienated by ingratitude, or\r\nseduced by newer attractions.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Pesaro seems to have become the permanent\r\nresidence of the ducal establishment, although the original capital\r\nwas frequently visited by its successive princes. Sanuto's Diaries\r\nafford us glimpses of life at that court, in detailing the journey\r\nto Rome of four Venetian envoys in March of this year. They arrived\r\non Good Friday, half dead of fatigue, fear, and hunger, having\r\nridden one hundred and twelve miles in two days, through wretched\r\nweather and a plague-stricken country. The two Duchesses of Urbino\r\nimmediately sent them a pressing invitation to transfer their\r\nquarters from the inn to better lodgings. This was about sunset, and\r\ntwilight had scarcely set in when both these ladies arrived in a fine\r\ngilt coach, lined with white cloth and trimmings of black velvet,\r\ndrawn by four beautiful black and grey horses. They were suffering\r\nfrom fever, the younger Duchess having risen from bed expressly to\r\nvisit the envoys, and apologise for a reception which, but for so\r\nunlooked-for an arrival, would have been more conformable to their\r\nwishes. Yet the apartment was tapestried from roof to floor, the beds\r\nwith gold brocade coverlets, and the curtains very handsome. Next\r\nmorning, after breakfast, the guests went to the palace to wait upon\r\nthe Duchesses, who met them in the fourth ante-room, whence, after\r\nsundry ceremonies, they handed the ladies and their attendants into\r\nthe presence-chamber, newly done up with arrases, gilding, and a daïs\r\nof silk. After conversing in an under-tone for three-quarters of\r\nan hour, they retired with the like formalities. On Easter Sunday,\r\nafter vespers, they had an audience of leave, when the younger\r\nDuchess, being very seriously indisposed, received them familiarly\r\nin a bed-chamber so small that they could not all enter it, renewing\r\nmany excuses for their indifferent entertainment, in consequence of\r\nthe religious observances, and the recent arrival of the household\r\nat Pesaro. On their return from congratulating the new Pontiff, the\r\nenvoys passed by Gubbio, where the Duchesses again surprised them by\r\na visit ere breakfast was over, attended by several lovely maidens.\r\n\r\nThe engagement which Francesco Maria had accepted, to command the\r\nFlorentine armies for a year, did not call him from this retirement;\r\nit was important only as indicating an apparent reconciliation\r\nwith the Cardinal de' Medici, to which the latter was induced by\r\napprehension that he might have otherwise proved a formidable\r\nopponent to his interest in a future conclave. After a somewhat\r\nserious illness, the Duke repaired to Rome, to offer his homage on\r\nthe arrival of Adrian in Italy, and was honourably received and\r\nformally invested with his restored dignities. He rode there escorted\r\nby two hundred lances, and was lodged by the Venetian ambassador in\r\nthe palace of S. Marco. His late eventful history rendered him an\r\nobject of general interest, and he was universally admitted to have\r\nborne his reverses with firmness, his successes with moderation.\r\nTo commemorate these, he adopted this device, invented for him by\r\nGiovio,--a palm-tree, whose crest was weighed downwards by a block\r\nof marble, with the motto, \"Though depressed, it recoils.\" This\r\nemblem of valour and constancy, which adversity could bend but could\r\nnot break, he bore upon his banner and trumpets, and frequently\r\nintroduced it in his coinage.\r\n\r\nThe repose of Italy was, as usual, of brief duration. Wearied of\r\nthose contests in which the ambition of France had for thirty years\r\ninvolved the Peninsula, the leading powers began to regard Francesco\r\nSforza's maintenance in the duchy of Milan as their best guarantee\r\nof peace. This policy was warmly adopted by the Emperor, interested\r\nalike in the welfare of the Neapolitan territory, and in humbling\r\nhis rival Francis I. The result was a new confederation, to which\r\nthe Pope, the Emperor, Henry VIII., Venice, Milan, and Florence were\r\nparties, but which brought on a general war, the very evil it was\r\nintended to avert. Francesco Maria's condotta with the Florentines\r\nbeing expired, he was named to succeed Teodoro Trivulzio, whose\r\nsupposed French tendencies occasioned his removal from command of\r\nthe Venetian troops. Those of the Church were committed to the\r\nMarquis of Mantua, and Prospero Colonna was general-in-chief of the\r\nLeague Lautrec and l'Escu[294] having been recalled, the Admiral\r\nGouffier de Bonnivet was sent into Lombardy to make good the title\r\nof his master to the Milanese, whose daring spirit looked not beyond\r\nthe glory of encountering single-handed the armies of Europe. This\r\nstruggle, eventually so ruinous to Italy, so fatal to Rome, had\r\nscarcely commenced ere Adrian was called from events which he was\r\nin no respect fitted to direct. He died on the 24th of September,\r\n1523,[*295] and was succeeded on the 19th of November by the Cardinal\r\nde' Medici, as Clement VII., whose first act was an adherence to the\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: Odet de Foix, Seigneur de Lautrec, and the Seigneur de\r\nl'Escu were both brothers of the chivalrous Gaston de Foix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *295: He died on the 14th September. For details, cf. Duke\r\nof Sessa's letters in _Bergenroth_, pp. 597, 599.]\r\n\r\nProspero Colonna did not long survive the Pontiff. From him, perhaps,\r\nFrancesco Maria adopted the over-cautious policy which marked his\r\nmilitary manoeuvres during the remainder of his life, and which\r\ncontrasts strongly with the dashing valour of his early career. For\r\nthis he has been severely blamed by Sismondi, and we shall see it\r\nattended with very miserable results. Fortunately for the Duke's\r\nfame, his reputation in arms had been firmly established before the\r\nlater and more important years of his military prowess arrived. Ere\r\nthe allies had completed their preparations, the French poured into\r\nLombardy, carried Lodi, and laid siege to Cremona. The Venetian\r\ntroops occupied the banks of the Oglio, where they were joined by\r\nthe Duke of Urbino, as soon as he had received credentials and\r\ninstructions from the senate; his own stipulated contingent, under\r\nhis lieutenant-general Landriano, having already effected a junction.\r\n\r\nMachiavelli, ever prone to cast reflections on mercenary troops, has\r\nremarked that the Republic lost her superiority from the time that\r\nshe extensively employed them. This, however, is but a partial view\r\nof the case. By their means, backed by their maritime supremacy,\r\nand by her matchless diplomatic system, she gradually extended\r\nher mainland territory, in spite of the unmilitary genius of her\r\npeople, until jealousy combined nearly all Europe against her in\r\nthe League of Cambray. But there was another fault inherent in\r\nthe organisation of her armies. Dark suspicion was the permeating\r\nprinciple of her policy. Each branch of the executive jealously\r\nwatched the others. Magistrates distrusted their colleagues; fathers\r\nset spies upon their sons, husbands upon their wives; governors and\r\ngoverned doubted their paid troops, or countermined their selected\r\ngenerals. The senate accordingly sent with their stipendiary forces\r\ncommissioners instructed to watch, and empowered to control, the\r\nleaders--a check necessarily inducing dissension, for, as Macaulay\r\nhas happily remarked, what army commanded by a debating club ever\r\nescaped discomfiture and disgrace? Under the title of _proveditori_,\r\nthese official spies performed some of the duties belonging to\r\ncommissaries-general; and although this plan for controlling soldiers\r\nof fortune, who owed little fidelity to the cause, and whose ruling\r\nprinciple was usually self-interest, might seem the result of wise\r\nprecaution, it practically occasioned perpetual embarrassments, and\r\nfomented personal quarrels, paralysing operations in the field. Such\r\nan _imperium in imperio_ had in this instance its usual results.\r\nDistracted councils and divided responsibility hampered free action,\r\nand rendered abortive the best-laid plans.[*296] Throughout the long\r\nwar now opening, the system was pregnant with peculiar mischief, and\r\nit ought to bear much of the blame of that dilatory inefficiency\r\nwhich is charged against Francesco Maria. Thus the Proveditore Emo,\r\nat the very outset of this campaign, prevented him from crossing the\r\nOglio to harass the retreat of Renzo da Ceri, who, after loitering\r\naway two months before Cremona, was recalled to the siege of Milan.\r\nThe Duke, however, soon after advanced to the Adda, and during the\r\nrigour of winter occupied his troops in fortifying themselves at\r\nMartinengo, from whence they were enabled to annoy the enemy by\r\ncontinual forays towards Lodi.[297]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *296: As usual, Machiavelli is right. If the _proveditori_\r\nhad so bad an influence (and it was doubtless bad) the results should\r\nhave been earlier seen, for it was an old custom with that Republic.\r\nFrancesco Maria, whom Dennistoun rates so highly as a soldier, as we\r\nhave seen, was not more harassed by these spies than his forerunners,\r\nCarmagnuola Colleoni and Sigismondo Malatesta. The custom rose out\r\nof the decision to employ no citizen as a captain-general. Nor was\r\nVenice alone in this practice; Siena and Florence followed it too on\r\noccasions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: Sismondi's strictures curtly express the judgment\r\npronounced upon Francesco Maria by those who follow, without\r\nexamination, the prejudiced narrative of Guicciardini. Yet, as\r\nthey are founded upon admitted defects in his generalship, it may\r\nbe well to lay them before the reader. \"He was not deficient in\r\nmilitary talent, nor probably in personal courage, but, taking\r\nProspero Colonna as his prototype, he exaggerated his method. His\r\nonly tactics consisted in the selection and occupation of impregnable\r\npositions; whatever his numerical superiority, he evaded fighting; no\r\ncircumstance, however urgent, could bring him to a general action;\r\nand by his obstinacy in refusing to risk anything, he made certain\r\nof losing all.\" But in estimating the commander we should not put\r\nout of view the discouraging nature of the cause, which this author\r\nelsewhere happily describes as a war without an object. *This applies\r\nbetter to the petty wars of Central Italy at this time and in the\r\nfifteenth century. Waged by paid captains, they may be said to have\r\nbeen without an object, or rather with but one object--war itself.\r\nOne and all they ended in nothing, though here and there, as with the\r\nSforza, the condottiere managed to establish himself. There was not,\r\nsave in Florence, Milan, and Venice, a sufficiently strong economic\r\nreason to cause a real war. Such as they were, these wars were due to\r\nthe greed of petty princes, in which the professional armies enjoyed\r\nthemselves (few being killed) in sacking towns and cities whose\r\ninhabitants, altogether at their mercy, were the only victims. To\r\ndrag out the war and to avoid serious fighting as much as possible\r\nwere naturally the first objects of the average condottiere.]\r\n\r\nThe command vacated by the death of Prospero Colonna was conferred\r\nupon Don Carlos de Lanoy, Viceroy of Naples, who arrived at\r\nhead-quarters in the spring, and, upon drawing together the\r\nconfederates from their winter quarters, found himself at the head\r\nof about twenty thousand foot, and four thousand lances and light\r\ncavalry. Among their leaders were the Constable de Bourbon, the\r\nPrince of Orange, and Don Ugo de Moncada, with all of whom we shall\r\noften meet during the next few years.\r\n\r\nIn the confederate army there were too many conflicting interests,\r\ntoo many rival leaders; but it was the peculiar misfortune of the\r\nDuke of Urbino to serve a power whose jealousy exceeded all rational\r\nbounds. It was not without considerable persuasion that he obtained\r\nof the Signory sanction to cross the Adda, and unite their troops,\r\namounting to twelve hundred horse and six thousand foot, with the\r\nforces of the League. The first combined operation was directed\r\nagainst Gherlasco, which Francesco Maria, though in command of the\r\nrear-guard, was permitted to carry by assault with his own division,\r\nbeing greatly aided by using explosive shells. From thence they\r\nadvanced to Vercelli, taking Trumello, Sartirana, and other places\r\nby the way. This movement was intended at once to cut off supplies\r\nfrom the French army posted at Novara, and to intercept a strong\r\nbody of Swiss, for whom they were anxiously waiting. The allies\r\nhaving reached Vercelli, it became a race which army should first\r\ngain the bridge of Romagnano, to the west whereof lay the Swiss\r\nsubsidy. The French had almost passed, when Lanoy fell upon their\r\nrear, which suffered immensely in men, baggage, and artillery; and\r\ntheir commander, Bonnivet, was wounded. The credit of all these\r\narrangements is claimed by Leone for the Duke of Urbino, whose\r\nannoyance may be imagined when he found himself arrested from reaping\r\nthe full benefit of their success, by interference of Pietro da\r\nPesaro, the Proveditore. That officer, standing upon the engagement\r\nof the Venetian contingent to serve only within the confines of the\r\nMilanese, objected to their passing the Sesia, which here formed\r\nits limit, and thus nullified the resolution of the confederates\r\nto follow up their partial victory by such a well-timed attack as\r\nmight drive the enemy across the Alps. The indignant army appealed\r\nto Francesco Maria to break through this official obstruction, but\r\nthe commissioner was right to the letter, and the stern Signory\r\nsanctioned no latitude of construction on the part of its servants.\r\nThe Duke, however, gained his consent by private remonstrances, at\r\nonce temperate and energetic, but especially by threatening to throw\r\nup his commission from the senate, and as a free captain to pass with\r\nhis own company into the allies' service, leaving the Proveditore,\r\nwith a disorganised contingent, to bear the whole responsibility of\r\nlosing so admirable an opportunity of cutting short a struggle, which\r\nit was in every view the interest of his republic to close.[298]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: The details given by Paruta appear to bear out\r\nthis statement of the Duke's policy, but establish that, in the\r\neyes of his employers, his prudence and caution availed more than\r\ndashing gallantry, an admission important in estimating his conduct\r\nthroughout the campaign of Lombardy, and throwing light upon the\r\nhesitation which marked his subsequent career. Indeed, according to\r\nthis author, the orders of the Signory were to avoid fighting as much\r\nas possible.]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the French troops devolved, in consequence of the\r\nAdmiral's wound, upon Piere de Terrail, Chevalier de Bayard, who was\r\nnot long spared in a command which the blunders of his predecessor\r\nhad rendered hopeless. On the 30th of April, whilst drawing off\r\nthe rear-guard under the enemy's fire, a shot fractured his spine.\r\nRefusing to be carried from the spot, he had himself supported\r\nagainst a tree, with his face to the foe, and continued to give his\r\norders with composure: at length, feeling the hand of death upon him,\r\nhe confessed himself to his faithful squire, kissing the hand-guard\r\nof his sword as a substitute for the cross. The imperialists\r\nremaining masters of the field, he was approached by the Constable\r\nBourbon, to whose words of sympathy and regret he sternly replied,\r\n\"Grieve not for me, but for yourself, fighting against your king and\r\ncountry.\" His fall was reported to Charles V. by the imperial envoy,\r\nAdrian de Croy, in these touching terms:--\"Sire, although the said\r\nM. Bayard was in the service of your enemy, his death is certainly a\r\npity; for he was a gentle knight beloved of all, whose life had been\r\nas well spent as ever was that of any of his condition, as, indeed,\r\nhe fully testified at its close, which was the most beautiful I\r\never heard tell of.\" Thus fell, in his forty-ninth year, the flower\r\nof French chivalry, \"the fearless and irreproachable knight.\" His\r\narmy evacuated Italy before the end of May, and the Duke of Urbino\r\nbeing entrusted with the recovery of Lodi, found it defended by\r\nhis relation and attached comrade-in-arms, Count Francesco del\r\nBozzolo, who, perceiving his position hopeless, soon capitulated upon\r\nhonourable terms.\r\n\r\nAfter the ample details we had given of the comparatively unimportant\r\nUrbino war, our rapid glance at the events in Upper Italy, from\r\n1521 to 1526, may seem superficial. But as these Lombard campaigns,\r\nalthough momentous to Europe, told very slightly upon the general\r\npolicy of the Peninsula, and as Francesco Maria bore no prominent\r\npart in their varying results, we must be content to pass over them\r\nthus cursorily, rather than to carry the reader too far from the more\r\nespecial object of these volumes. We may, however, pause for a moment\r\nupon the reception accorded to the Duke at Venice, when summoned\r\nthither to receive public thanks for his services, graphic details of\r\nwhich are supplied by the unedited Diaries of Sanuto.\r\n\r\nAfter he had, in compliance with orders from the Signory, disbanded\r\ntheir infantry, and disposed of their cavalry in the mainland\r\ngarrisons, he proceeded to the maritime capital. At Padua, the\r\nrectors had been premonished to pay him every attention; at the mouth\r\nof the Brenta, and on the outskirts of the city, he was met by two\r\ndeputations, each consisting of thirty young men of distinction, and\r\nwas addressed in a Latin oration, \"which he did not understand.\" He\r\nwas then escorted to the Rialto; and, after being welcomed by the\r\nDoge, and all the foreign ambassadors, except the French, he was led\r\non board the Bucentaur, an honour paid only to highest rank or rarest\r\nmerit; and thus, amid a flotilla of state galleys and gondolas,\r\ncrowded with a lively population in gala attire, their princely guest\r\nwas conducted along the grand canal, its palaces glittering with\r\nbrocades and arrases, its windows radiant with sparkling eyes and\r\nrich carnations, such as Titian and Pordenone loved to commemorate in\r\nglowing tints. The Duke wore a suit of black velvet, with frock and\r\ncap of scarlet, and was housed in an apartment prepared at the Casa\r\ndi San Marco, near San Giorgio Maggiore, with fifty ducats a day for\r\nhis expenses.\r\n\r\nThis festive welcome took place on the 25th of June. Next day\r\nbeing Sunday, the Duke presented himself at the Collegio, dressed\r\nin black damask over a white doublet, with a rose-coloured cap; a\r\nsmall person, of indifferent presence [_poca presentia_]. He was\r\nreceived outside of the audience-hall by the Doge and Signory;\r\nwhen admitted, he spoke in a few words, and with low voice, of his\r\nconstant readiness to serve their state with life and limb. To\r\nwhich the Doge replied, that he had acquitted himself well, but it\r\nwas their trust that he would do still better in future, and that,\r\nbeing fully assured of his fidelity, they had selected him for\r\ncaptain-general. The privileges of citizenship had been given him\r\nmany years before, in compliment to his uncle Guidobaldo, but the\r\ngeneral's baton was to be conferred upon him on the 2nd of July. In\r\ndeference, however, to the predictions of an astrologer, he requested\r\nthat his investiture might take place on the 29th of June, being St.\r\nPeter's day. Accordingly, the magnates and diplomatic functionaries\r\nof the most luxurious city in Christendom being assembled within\r\nits picturesque and time-honoured cathedral, Francesco Maria, was\r\nled in, magnificently arrayed in gold lama and damask, amid the din\r\nof trumpets and bagpipes. After celebration of high mass, during\r\nwhich he was seated on the Doge's left, the insignia, consisting of\r\na silver baton, and crimson standard with the lion in gold, were\r\nblessed at the high altar, and consigned to his hands by the Doge, as\r\nbadges of authority, which he then swore to employ for the glory of\r\nGod, and for maintenance and defence of the Republic. This solemnity\r\nwas hailed by the spectators' shouts, the clang of bells, the crash\r\nof martial music, the roar of artillery, and, as the Duke was\r\nconducted to his gondola by a long procession of military and civil\r\ndignitaries, the gorgeous piazza and gay canals displayed a splendour\r\nunwonted even in Venice.\r\n\r\nUnfavourable rumours of the Duchess's health rendered him impatient\r\nto be done with these honours, and were probably the true reason\r\nfor his desiring that the installation might be accelerated. But\r\nthe fashionable club or company della Calza so urged his remaining\r\nfor their festival, which had been fixed for the 3rd in compliment\r\nto him, that he could not well refuse a short delay in order to be\r\npresent.[299] The sports were enacted on that usual scene of Venetian\r\nmagnificence, the grand canal, decked out in many-tinted draperies,\r\nand thronged by gay parties. The club, with the Duke of Urbino and\r\nother honoured guests, were conveyed in two large flat barges,\r\nlashed together and beautifully curtained, wherein assembled the most\r\ndistinguished youths of both sexes, who revelled in music and dancing\r\nas they glided along the glassy surface. At length they stopped at\r\nthe massive, but now crumbling, Foscari palace, to witness a race of\r\nfour-oared gondolas, and concluded the entertainment with a supper\r\non the Rialto. Next day their sports were renewed, with addition of\r\na déjeuner, where fancy confections were presented to the principal\r\nguests--a triumphal chariot to Francesco Maria, an eagle to the\r\nimperial ambassador, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: See vol. I., p. 68, for a notice of this association,\r\nso often mentioned in Venetian history.]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July, after ten days spent in these monotonous\r\ngaieties, the Duke returned to Pesaro in his twelve-oared barge; but\r\nhis repose there was brief, for the second act soon opened of that\r\nbloody drama wherein the ambition of Charles and Francis involved\r\nItaly. An incursion of imperialists into Provence under the renegade\r\nBourbon had shifted the scene to France; but the French monarch,\r\nby a sudden movement across the Alps, transferred it once more\r\ninto Lombardy, and took possession of Milan. The Signory hastily\r\nsummoned their general from his duchy, to guard their frontier. The\r\nestablished order of Italian policy, however, rendering it probable\r\nthat new and contradictory combinations would speedily arise, his\r\ninstructions were to act upon the defensive; and a like temporising\r\nspirit prevailed in the councils of his Holiness, who secretly lent\r\nan ear to proposals of Francis for a combined effort to shake off\r\nthe Spanish domination in Naples. The Duke's undecided tactics, so\r\ncondemned by Sismondi, were therefore in accordance with orders,\r\nwhich the ever-present Proveditore took care were complied with. He\r\nthus had no share in the great battle of Pavia, which crushed the\r\nchivalry of France, accelerated the climax of Italian subjugation,\r\nand rendered Spanish influence fatally paramount in Southern Europe.\r\nIt was fought on the 25th of February, 1525, and left Francis\r\nprisoner in his rival's hands. Francesco Maria thereafter retired to\r\nCasali, suffering from a combined attack of gout and tertian fever,\r\nin which he was attended by his Duchess, who had hastened to see\r\nhim.[*300]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *300: The battle was fought on the 24th February.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n     New league against Charles V.--The Duke's campaign in\r\n     Lombardy--His quarrels with Guicciardini--Rome pillaged by\r\n     the Colonna--The Constable Bourbon advances into Central\r\n     Italy--The Duke quells an insurrection at Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papal policy since the accession of Julius had been directed\r\nto two leading objects. The first was to prevent any ultramontane\r\npower from attaining a decided preponderance in Europe; the second,\r\nto recover Italy from the barbarians, and restore its Neapolitan\r\nand Milanese states to native dynasties.[*301] The only effective\r\ncheck upon the unprecedented dominion of the Emperor having been\r\nannihilated by the overthrow and imprisonment of his sole rival, it\r\nbecame necessary for the Pontiff, in conformity with the former of\r\nthese purposes, to support the cause of France. The other object\r\nwas more than ever important, now that Milan was virtually at the\r\nconqueror's mercy; and a proposition for confirming the sovereignty\r\nof Sforza in that duchy, and placing the Marquis of Pescara on the\r\nthrone of Naples, appeared to His Holiness happily to meet the\r\nexigencies of the case. Clement, possessing neither the discernment\r\nof Julius nor the finesse of Leo, saw no difficulty in effecting this\r\nconvenient scheme, by simply uniting the independent states in a\r\nconspiracy to expel Charles beyond the Alps. But he reckoned without\r\nhis host. The Marquis of Pescara, who was high in the imperial\r\nservice, betrayed the plot in time to frustrate its execution. His\r\ndeath occurred soon after, from wounds received at Pavia, or possibly\r\nfrom poison, and the year was spent in intrigues and counterplots,\r\nwhich concern our present subject only as giving occasion to this\r\nletter, addressed by Francesco Maria to Cardinal Wolsey:--\r\n\r\n     \"Most illustrious and most worshipful Lord,\r\n\r\n     \"Having learned that his serene Majesty [Henry VIII.] has\r\n     named me his adherent in the league lately made with his\r\n     most Christian Majesty, it becomes a duty, which I by these\r\n     letters discharge, to tender my respects, and humbly to\r\n     kiss his hand, having no other proof at present to offer\r\n     of the extreme obligation which, in addition to numberless\r\n     others, I owe to his Majesty, for this affectionate and\r\n     honourable recollection of me. And knowing the love which\r\n     your most illustrious and reverend Lordship has ever\r\n     exhibited towards my house, and especially for myself, I am\r\n     satisfied (as, indeed, I have heard from the reverend Lord\r\n     Protonotary Casale) that you have always borne in mind the\r\n     services towards that crown of my most famous progenitors\r\n     and myself. Whence, in addition to the boundless obligation\r\n     I lie under to his most serene Majesty for naming me his\r\n     adherent, I hold myself therein indebted to your most\r\n     reverend and illustrious Lordship, considering it in a\r\n     great measure owing to you. I have therefore written these\r\n     presents, not as mere thanks, for I would not so commence\r\n     what I cannot complete by words alone, but that you may\r\n     know the great obligation I feel and have expressed, and\r\n     how intensely I desire an opportunity of effectively\r\n     demonstrating my natural and deserved anxiety to do you\r\n     service; the which will be clearly made patent to your most\r\n     reverend and illustrious Lordship, so often as I have it\r\n     in my power to act upon my intentions. And, recommending\r\n     myself to your good favour, I pray that you still keep\r\n     in mind my services to his majesty. From Verona the 14th\r\n     February, 1526.\r\n\r\n     \"_Servitor_,\r\n\r\n     \"EL DUCA D'URBINO.\"[302]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *301: So far as Julius is concerned, his one object was the\r\nabsolute temporal dominion of the Church in Italy. He made the coming\r\nof an ultramontane power into Italy a certainty. His successors\r\nstruggled in vain to save themselves and incidentally Italy from the\r\nconsequence of his crime. But the policy of the Papacy was wise, if\r\nselfish. The only road to Italian unity lay through predominance of\r\none power--Venice or Milan, for instance, or the Church herself. The\r\npopes successfully prevented this unity for more than a thousand\r\nyears, really in self-defence--the defence of their temporal power\r\nat any rate; their international claims were destroyed by an eager\r\nand passionate nationalism. We have seen in our day how Piedmont\r\nunited Italy, first destroying the Papacy, which remains merely as a\r\nspiritual power that seems in Italy to be slowly passing away.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: Brit. Mus. Cotton. MSS. Vit. B. VIII., f. 16, b. In f.\r\n49, of B.V. there is a mutilated letter of compliment from the Duke\r\nto Henry VIII., in Latin, dated at Urbino 19 March, 1522.]\r\n\r\nAt length, in May 1526, a new confederacy was announced, in which\r\nthe Pope, Francis I. (who had regained his liberty in March), Henry\r\nVIII., Venice, and Florence, were marshalled against Charles V.,\r\nnominally to wrest from him the Milanese, which remained in his hands\r\nafter the battle of Pavia. The citadel of Milan, however, was still\r\nheld by Francesco Sforza; and the Duke of Urbino, by the senate's\r\norders, led the Venetian troops from Verona to his relief, but under\r\nprotest that he considered them unequal to the service. On his march,\r\nhe received offers from an adherent of the Sforza to admit him into\r\nLodi, and immediately detaching Malatesta Baglione to avail himself\r\nof the proposal, hastened onwards with the army to his support. The\r\nattempt was completely successful, and after a gallant resistance\r\nthe imperialists evacuated the place on the 24th of June. This\r\nacquisition was of the utmost importance to the allies. It secured\r\nthem command of the Adda, and gave them a strong position in the\r\nenemy's country, from whence they could operate with equal facility\r\nagainst Milan, Cremona, or Pavia.\r\n\r\nThe army of the League which now mustered at Lodi is estimated by\r\nGuicciardini and Muratori at sixteen thousand foot and four thousand\r\nhorse. The Duke of Urbino was commander-in-chief of the Venetians;\r\nCount Guido Rangone held the same rank in the ecclesiastical forces,\r\nwhich included, however, the papal and Florentine contingents, led by\r\ntheir respective captains-general, Giovanni de' Medici and Vitello\r\nVitelli. The embarrassment occasioned by so many commanders, under no\r\ncommon head, was especially felt by Francesco Maria, who, although\r\nadmitted by Guicciardini to have been pre-eminent in rank, authority,\r\nand reputation, as well as actually leader of the combined army,\r\nwas controlled by Pesaro, the Venetian Proveditore, and thwarted\r\nby the Pope's anomalous appointment of that historian himself as\r\nlieutenant-general, with ample indeed almost absolute powers in the\r\narmy and throughout the states of the Church.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Guicciardini was a Florentine gentleman, born in 1482, and\r\neducated for the law, who, profiting by the partiality of Leo X. for\r\nhis fellow-citizens, had held several important civil appointments,\r\nand had been successively named governor of Modena, Reggio, and\r\nParma, to which Clement added, in 1523, a jurisdiction over all\r\npontifical Romagna. He was gifted with considerable talents and\r\ngreat command of language, but these promotions had rendered him\r\nvain and overbearing. The accounts given us by the Urbino writers,\r\nof one whom they had good reason to regard with prejudice, should\r\nbe received with caution; yet some anecdotes have come down which\r\nconfirm the allegation of Leoni, that his dogmatical pretensions\r\nwere neither authorised by etiquette, nor supported by his judgment\r\nor military experience.[303] No defect of character was less likely\r\nto meet with toleration from the blunt and hasty Francesco Maria,\r\nand in consequence of their being opposed to each other at the\r\ncouncil-board, alike in momentous and trifling matters, scenes of\r\ninsult and violence ripened aversion into rancour. In this contest\r\nthe Florentine had the worst, but he amply availed himself of his\r\npen as a means of vengeance; and in his History, which has become\r\na standard authority, he studiously and throughout misrepresented\r\nthe Duke of Urbino. Lipsius, while bearing strong testimony to\r\nhis general truth and impartiality, admits that he on no occasion\r\nconcealed his detestation of that prince. Later writers, especially\r\nSismondi, have adopted his strictures with little modification,\r\nand an ingenious defence of the Duke, prepared by Baldi after his\r\ndeath, having never seen the light, the portraits of him hitherto\r\npassing current in history are exaggerations of a malevolent pencil.\r\nYet it appears beyond question that an over-dilatory and cautious\r\nsystem increased upon Francesco Maria, and, in conjunction with\r\nother circumstances, greatly hampered his tactics and impaired their\r\nsuccess, during his service under the lion of St. Mark.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: Leonardi's recollections of Francesco Maria, Vat. Urb.\r\nMSS., No. 1023, f. 85, and Baldi's defence of him from Guicciardini's\r\ncharges, _Ibid._, No. 906, f. 214.]\r\n\r\nThe allied forces very considerably outnumbered those of Charles,\r\nwho were scattered among several garrisons and detached positions.\r\nThe moment, therefore, seemed propitious for following up their\r\nrecent success, and effecting the main object of the campaign by a\r\ndecided blow against Milan. That capital was occupied by about nine\r\nthousand imperialist troops, who blockaded Sforza in the citadel,\r\nand who, in letters casually intercepted, represented the citizens,\r\nthough disarmed by their conquerors, as mature for a rising. A prompt\r\nmovement for the relief of the hard-pressed fortress was therefore\r\nurged by Guicciardini, and seconded by the Proveditore, whose ear\r\nhe had gained. The reasons by which Francesco Maria combated this\r\nproposal savoured unquestionably, even by Leoni's admission, rather\r\nof hollow excuses than of sound judgment, for whilst he awaited the\r\nSwiss auxiliaries, he allowed reinforcements to reach the imperial\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nSome light is, however, thrown upon this seeming inconsistency by an\r\nargument in his Discorsi Militari, wherein the Duke illustrates, from\r\nthis very passage in his life, two axioms he broadly lays down,--that\r\nto rely mainly for the success of a war upon the support of a people,\r\nhowever gallant, is a great risk, if not inevitable ruin; and that no\r\npopular rising ever succeeded of itself, or without an overpowering\r\nforce to second it. Considering that his uncle and himself had\r\nthrice regained their state by a popular emeute, this doctrine may\r\nseem ungracious from his mouth. Without, however, entering upon a\r\nquestion which the recent experience of Europe has greatly affected,\r\nor examining instances adduced by the Duke in support of his views,\r\nit seems likely that his reasoning was adopted to cloak some unavowed\r\nmotive. Perhaps the alternative suggestion which he offered may\r\nafford some clue to the truth, keeping in view the relationship and\r\nconfidential intercourse which had ever been maintained between the\r\nprinces of Urbino and Ottaviano Fregoso. His proposition was that,\r\ninstead of opposing their new and ill-disciplined levies to the\r\nveteran and lately victorious occupants of Milan, the allies should\r\ndraw off towards Genoa, and there restore the supremacy of the\r\nFregosi, thus giving time for the arrival of Swiss subsidies, and\r\nenabling them perhaps to intercept the reinforcements which Bourbon\r\nwas bringing by sea from Spain. The motive alleged by Sismondi for\r\nthis policy rests upon the broader ground of the Duke's desire to\r\nhumble Clement, in revenge for all he had suffered, rather from the\r\nPontiff's family than from himself; and it must be admitted that\r\nmuch of his conduct during this lamentable and inglorious war, until\r\nit ended in the sack of Rome, could scarcely have been different if\r\nactuated by that ungenerous calculation. Yet in the instance now\r\nunder our consideration, it is but fair to notice Leoni's assertion,\r\nthat his opinions were supported by Giovanni de' Medici _delle Bande\r\nNere_, whilst those of Guicciardini, obtaining the suffrages of the\r\nother leaders, carried the day.\r\n\r\nWith such diversity of opinion prevailing among commanders of\r\nnearly equal authority, it is not surprising that the advance upon\r\nMilan should have been most sluggish. After spending nine days in\r\nmarching about twenty miles, the army, on the 6th of July, drew\r\nround that city, which the enemy, notwithstanding Bourbon's arrival\r\nthe preceding night with the Spanish succours, are supposed by\r\nSismondi to have been on the point of evacuating. The artillery\r\nhaving next morning begun to play upon the walls, a sally was made,\r\nand the allied troops, finding themselves under fire, behaved most\r\nscandalously, so that, had not Francesco Maria with the cavalry\r\npromptly supported the panic-stricken infantry of his own and the\r\npapal brigades, they must have suffered a total rout. Alarmed at\r\nthese symptoms of unsteadiness, and unseconded by the expected\r\ninsurrection within, the Venetian Proveditore and Guicciardini\r\ninsisted upon a general retreat, as the only means by which their\r\nforces could escape destruction. In despair, they besought the Duke\r\nto take the retiring army under his command, a charge which he did\r\nnot accept without taunting them on a result that so fully bore out\r\nhis predictions, and proved their rashness in exposing an unorganised\r\nhost of raw Italians to fight the veterans of Germany and Spain.\r\nBut the moment was too critical for recrimination. Two hours before\r\ndawn the camp was silently raised, and the army withdrew in good\r\norder about twelve miles to Marignano. Their rear was effectually\r\nguarded by Giovanni de' Medici against any sally of the imperialists,\r\nbut no less than four thousand of the foot were missing, having\r\nignominiously deserted their colours.\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of Leoni and Baldi. Guicciardini, on the other\r\nhand, takes to himself credit for using every argument with the Duke\r\nagainst a retreat, which he designates as uncalled for and infamous.\r\nUpon his despatches were, no doubt, formed the opinions expressed in\r\nthe following letter of the Bishop of Worcester to Cardinal Wolsey:--\r\n\r\n     \"Most Illustrious and Reverend Lord,\" &c.\r\n\r\n     \"I have hitherto daily informed you of what was going\r\n     on, by longer or shorter letters, as time permitted. At\r\n     present nothing new has transpired, except that, on the\r\n     night of the 7th inst., the Duke of Urbino, captain-general\r\n     of the ecclesiastical and Venetian forces, after most\r\n     strenuous and gallant operations against the enemy, from\r\n     which a successful issue was expected, suddenly changing\r\n     his intention, notwithstanding numerous protests, drew off\r\n     his army to Marignano, a town ten miles from Milan. Which,\r\n     though the Duke, as usual, entangles it with numerous\r\n     reasons, has exposed him to no slight disparagement from\r\n     the public. I have only further humbly to commend myself to\r\n     your most illustrious Lordship. From Rome, 11th July, 1526.\r\n\r\n     \"Your most illustrious and reverend Lordship's\r\n     _Humillimum manicipium_,\r\n\r\n     \"HI[~C]. EP[~S]. WIGORNIEÑ.\"[304]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: Brit. Mus. Cotton. MSS., Vit. B. VIII., f. 93 b. In\r\nthis volume are many despatches regarding the Lombard campaign, and\r\nthe assault on Rome in 1526.]\r\n\r\nThe prejudices of Guicciardini are admitted by the Venetian Paruta,\r\nwho tells us that the Signory were satisfied with their general's\r\nexplanations, but cautioned him for the future, to communicate his\r\nviews more frankly to the papal commissioner. It is a passage of\r\nhistory hard to clear up, and in every view redounding little to the\r\ncredit of its actors, whether we most blame the Duke's policy or the\r\nunsteadiness of his troops. Exposures so disgraceful well merited\r\nthe sneer, that the swords in that army had no edge; and Sismondi\r\nadmits that its spiritless conduct goes far to justify its leader's\r\ndispiriting tactics.[*305]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *305: See Guicciardini's despairing letters to Giberti,\r\n_Opere Inedite_ (1857-67, Firenze), vol. IV., pp. 73-146. Francesco\r\nMaria was to blame; he lost time in crossing the Adda, from\r\nwhatever cause; he delayed again while the generals of the Emperor\r\nstrengthened their lines round Milan--even when the allies arrived\r\nand their army numbered 20,000 against the 11,000 of the besiegers.\r\nHe waited the arrival of the Swiss, he said, and went off meanwhile\r\nat the heels of the Venetian Proveditore to besiege Cremona. The\r\nRocca of Milan fell on July 24th.]\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July, the confederates, having been joined by five\r\nthousand Swiss levies, again approached the city, and were met by\r\nabout three hundred women and children, whom Sforza had dismissed\r\nas embarrassing his defence. Shamed by their representations, the\r\nleaders, in a council of war, decided upon a new attempt to relieve\r\nthe citadel, which, however, Giovanni de' Medici, after inspecting\r\nthe works of the besiegers, opposed as too perilous. Whilst they\r\nlost time in these discussions, Sforza was fairly starved out, and\r\nsurrendered the fortress on the 24th. Leoni and Baldi agree in\r\ncharging these dilatory and unsatisfactory proceedings upon the other\r\ngenerals, and the total inefficiency of the army, rather than upon\r\nFrancesco Maria's tactics. They may be considered as biased, but the\r\nfollowing anecdotes will show how far the Florentine historian had\r\nreason to be impartial.\r\n\r\nAt one of the war councils held in the Certosa of Pavia, Guicciardini\r\nhaving cast some doubt upon an opinion expressed by the Duke, was\r\nthus answered: \"Your business is to confer with pedants.\" These\r\nrude words were accompanied by a knock-down blow on the face,\r\nfollowed by an order to get up and begone! Leonardi, who preserves\r\nthis incident, adds, \"Such pugilistic sport was habitual to my Lord\r\nDuke; and it was well for those who could command their temper in\r\nreasoning with him, as he was ever ready to strike any one who\r\nargued against his views with disrespect.\" The historian's original\r\nprepossession against Francesco Maria, is ascribed by Baldi to a\r\nvain ambition of precedence. While lieutenant-general of the papal\r\nforces he displayed it towards Guido Rangone, his superior officer,\r\nand insisted on taking rank at the council-board of the Marquis of\r\nSaluzzo, when he arrived in command of the French contingents. These\r\nabsurd pretensions were at first treated with indifference, but\r\nfinally brought him into a wrangle with the Duke, over whom he also\r\nclaimed a similar right, from the fact of being in the papal service,\r\nwaiving it only out of consideration for his sovereign rank. In\r\nthat instance, also, he is said to have been struck by the choleric\r\nprince; at all events he was expelled from the council-chamber, and\r\na strong representation of his misconduct was made to the Pope, who\r\nconsequently cancelled his anomalous commission, and appointed him\r\ngovernor of Modena.\r\n\r\nSismondi, embodying Guicciardini's one-sided narrative,[*306] has\r\nthrown upon Francesco Maria the entire odium of the ludicrously slow\r\nmovements of the army, averaging about four miles on each alternate\r\nday, and of their double miscarriage before Milan. The fatal tendency\r\nof such measures, however they might have originated, admits of no\r\nquestion, and the responsibility of their failure must fall upon the\r\nmost influential leader. It is always difficult in a heterogeneous\r\nconfederacy to maintain that unity of purpose which may compensate\r\nfor diversity of interests, and which can only be insured by prompt\r\naction and brilliant success. But the sentiment \"that reputation was\r\nneither to be gained by risks nor lost by delays,\" which Bernardo\r\nTasso puts into the Duke's mouth, in describing a council of war\r\nwhereat he assisted,[307] not only advocates quite a different\r\npolicy, but too well confirms the charge brought against him as one\r\nof those\r\n\r\n     \"Generals who will not conquer when they may.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote *306: See his despairing letters cited above, p. 441, note\r\n*1. He was a true patriot and thought for Italy. The Duke's dilatory\r\nand inconclusive actions while Italy was slowly dying, and might have\r\nbeen saved, as he thought, disgusted and enraged him.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: _Lettere_, I., p. 28, edit. 1733.]\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he perceived victory to be hopeless, in an army\r\ndistracted by the jealousies of rival leaders, he had proposed\r\nthe nomination of a commander-in-chief, avowing himself ready to\r\naccord him implicit obedience. In this he was again thwarted by\r\nGuicciardini, who represented his suggestion to the allied powers\r\nas dictated by personal ambition of the post. The plan fell to the\r\nground, and its author, fretted by the difficulties of his position,\r\nwas attacked by severe illness. Of this the Proveditore availed\r\nhimself to lead Malatesta Baglione, with three thousand troops, to\r\nCremona. Like Milan, it was occupied by an imperialist brigade, who\r\nbesieged in the citadel a handful of Sforza's adherents. The Duke's\r\nwarnings as to its military difficulties having been received with\r\nindifference, this enterprise was on the point of miscarriage, on\r\nlearning which he rose from a sick bed, and hurried with fresh forces\r\nto the scene of action. His presence infused new energy into the\r\noperations, and on the 23rd of September the town was evacuated by\r\nthe imperialists upon capitulation.\r\n\r\nThis success was scarcely within his grasp when a courier arrived\r\nfrom Rome, with tidings which gave a new aspect to affairs. Clement,\r\nwho had succeeded to the turbulence of his predecessors, without the\r\nenergy of Julius, or the address of Leo, made himself a dangerous\r\ndomestic foe in the Colonna,--broken, but not crushed by the rancour\r\nof Alexander VI. Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, a man indifferent to\r\nreligion, whose unbounded ambition aimed directly at the tiara,\r\nand whose brows better became a condottiere's casque than a mitre,\r\nforgetting his duty as one of the Sacred College, entered into\r\ntreasonable correspondence with the imperialist leaders; and his\r\nbrother Marcello, having been driven from his fiefs by the Pope,\r\nthrew himself at the feet of Charles V., offering to support his\r\nviews upon Italy if reponed by his assistance. They also used their\r\ninfluence at Venice in preventing his Holiness from raising a loan\r\nto recruit his crippled resources, and, in concert with Don Ugo\r\nMoncada, commander of the Neapolitan army, strove to alienate him\r\nfrom the League. Don Ugo, a Spaniard by birth, was the worthy pupil\r\nof Cesare Borgia, without his reputation for success. In every\r\nimportant engagement his sword had been tarnished by defeat; his\r\ncharacter and personal adventures combined each brutal attribute\r\nof a condottiere, with scarcely a redeeming trait of honour. The\r\nplan of these confederates was by a coup-de-main to dictate terms\r\nto the Pontiff; or, failing success in this, to give occupation at\r\nhome for the contingent he then maintained with the allied army\r\nof Lombardy. Accordingly, the Colonna troops, who had assumed a\r\nthreatening attitude in the Campagna, were suddenly withdrawn beyond\r\nthe frontier; and a son of Prospero Colonna hastened to the capital\r\nto throw himself at Clement's feet, assuring him of the pacific\r\ndisposition of his house, and that their levies were destined for\r\nthe imperial service at Naples. The Pope, being deceived into a\r\nbelief so conformable to his wishes, turned a deaf ear to the warning\r\nof more clear-sighted men, and, disappointed of his loan, thought\r\nonly of reducing a war establishment he could no longer pay. But\r\nso soon as his soldiery were dismissed, the Colonna recalled their\r\narmy of two thousand men, which, led by Pompeo with equal celerity\r\nand success, reached the Lateran gate ere treachery was suspected.\r\nResistance being hopeless, they, on the 20th of September, marched\r\nthrough the city into the Trastevere, where they were welcomed to\r\nrefreshments provided by the Cardinal's order. Thence they passed\r\ninto the Borgo S. Spirito, where are situated the Vatican, St.\r\nPeter's, and the castle of St. Angelo, and within three hours had\r\npillaged that rich quarter, sparing neither the palace nor the\r\nmetropolitan church. The Pope, who had at first resolved to await\r\ndeath in his pontifical chair, scarcely escaped with a few valuables\r\ninto the fortress, which, from unpardonable negligence, was entirely\r\nunprovisioned. To arrest these horrors, the Pontiff next day made a\r\nhasty four-months' truce, stipulating for the immediate evacuation of\r\nRome, as the condition on which he should recall Guicciardini with\r\nthe ecclesiastical troops from Upper Italy; three days, however,\r\nelapsed ere the troops withdrew, laden with a booty estimated at\r\n300,000 ducats.[308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: This treaty is printed by Molini, in the _Documenti di\r\nStoria Italiana_, I., 229. At p. 204 of the same volume is a despatch\r\nthrowing valuable light on the tangled diplomacy of these times. The\r\ndetails of this event are often mixed up with those of the far more\r\natrocious sack of Rome perpetrated by Bourbon a few months later; the\r\nbest account of it is by Negri, an eye-witness, in the _Lettere de'\r\nPrincipi_.]\r\n\r\nUpon the capitulation of Cremona, Francesco Maria stole a few days\r\nfor the society of his Duchess, and the affairs of his state, but was\r\nspeedily recalled to his post by the unsatisfactory aspect of matters\r\nin Lombardy. The papal troops had been withdrawn; the garrison\r\nof Cremona, whose services the Venetians would not retain at his\r\nsuggestion, had entered into new engagements with the enemy; fourteen\r\nthousand _lanznechts_, alias _lansquenet_ infantry, under Georg v.\r\nFründesberg, were marching from Germany by the Val di Sabbia to\r\nsupport the imperial cause. His first care was to check the pillage\r\nof Cremona, a service which the citizens acknowledged by presenting\r\nto him a golden vase weighing twenty pounds, and beautifully chased\r\nwith appropriate devices. He found the Marquis of Saluzzo arrived\r\nwith about five thousand levies from France, and that the _bande\r\nnere_, amounting to almost as many, had been engaged by that power,\r\non Guicciardini's departure, whose absence proved a vast relief\r\nto him. The army is now estimated at twenty-five thousand men by\r\nSismondi, who, echoing the charges of that writer, severely blames\r\nthe Duke for not supporting the naval attack made by the French upon\r\nGenoa, a scheme for which we have seen him contending at an earlier\r\nperiod. But a passage in his own _Discorsi Militari_ expressly states\r\nthe Venetian force at four thousand infantry and five thousand\r\ncavalry, to keep in check both Fründesberg's lansquenets and ten\r\nthousand men at Milan; and it explains his tactics to consist in\r\nmaking Cremona the centre of a line of defence, embracing Bergamo on\r\nthe right, and Genoa on the left, which, being vastly too extended\r\nfor his force, necessitated his keeping his men together, in order\r\nto move upon any exposed point. Accordingly, considering it most\r\nincumbent to intercept the battalions of Fründesberg, he, after\r\nthrowing garrisons into some important places on his right flank,\r\npushed towards Mantua with about ten thousand men. Although sadly\r\nimpeded by dreadful weather, and by difficulties of transport, the\r\nProveditore having secured all the cattle to carry his own baggage\r\nto Venice, he came up with the enemy at Borgoforte, on the Po, and,\r\ninterrupting their passage, drove their main body down the course of\r\nthat river. Deep snow and mud embarrassing his evolutions, he could\r\nonly hang upon their rear as far as the Mincio, where they were\r\nmet by a reinforcement with artillery from Ferrara. Thereupon the\r\nDuke recalled his skirmishers, and left the Germans to pass the Po\r\nunobstructed, on the 30th of November.\r\n\r\nIn this affair fell Giovanni de' Medici, whose birth we have formerly\r\nnoticed.[309] His name is consecrated to military renown by a halo\r\nwhich his lion-heart well merited, and which has gained no additional\r\nbrilliancy from the attempts of some writers to elevate his fame at\r\nFrancesco Maria's expense. In this unworthy effort--as on too many\r\nlike occasions--Guicciardini has been followed by the historian of\r\nthe Italian republics. The charges of misconduct adduced against\r\nthe Duke of Urbino, in his movement against Fründesberg, are by no\r\nmeans borne out by the more detailed accounts supplied by Leoni\r\nand Baldi. He seems to have done everything that the state of the\r\nelements would allow; and even accused himself of occasioning the\r\ndeath of his faithful captain Benedetto Giraldi of Mondolfo, by\r\nanswering his plea, that his charger was completely knocked up, with\r\nthe sarcasm,--\"What! you to whom I give a hundred scudi of yearly\r\npay, have not a fresh pair of horses at such a moment!\" Stung by this\r\nreproach, the gallant officer urged his steed to new efforts, and\r\nshared the fate of Giovanni de' Medici. The brigade of the latter,\r\nout of respect for their leader, assumed those mourning scarfs which\r\nprocured them the name _delle bande nere_; and most of them soon\r\nafter passed to Rome in the papal service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: See above, p. 385.]\r\n\r\nThe German lansquenets, whom Fründesberg had brought into Italy,\r\nwere in fact a free company, levied by himself on a mere plundering\r\nadventure, without the pretext of pay. Alarmed at a reinforcement\r\nof so obnoxious a character, the confederates bethought themselves\r\nof renewed efforts. But disgusted with a drawling campaign, wherein\r\nno party had exhibited either good heart or doughty deeds, they had\r\nrecourse to diplomacy, which, ever fluctuating between an inactive\r\nwar and a solid peace, failed to create any general interest.\r\nThe truce with Moncada being expired they had no difficulty in\r\nenrolling the unstable Pontiff once more on their side; but intent\r\non his private quarrel with the Colonna, and burning to avenge the\r\noutrage lately received at their hands, he gave no co-operation\r\nto the League. His tortuous and feeble policy preferred rousing,\r\nby small intrigues, the old Angevine party at Naples against the\r\nimperial government, and sought the more sympathetic attractions\r\nof a petty strife with his refractory vassals. Having engaged the\r\n_bande nere_, he let them loose to carry fire and sword into the\r\nColonna holdings, depriving, at the same time, Cardinal Pompeo of\r\nhis hat, and thundering excommunication against his whole race.\r\nAs the spring advanced, he extended this inglorious warfare, with\r\n\"a worse than Turkish\" virulence, into the Neapolitan territory.\r\nMeanwhile, the Viceroy Lanoy, after narrowly escaping the fleet of\r\nAndrea Doria, landed ten thousand fresh troops at Gaeta, and advanced\r\nupon Rome, supported by Moncada and the Colonna. But the vengeance\r\nof God against the Holy City was reserved for other hands. After a\r\nslight check from the _bande nere_, at Frosinone, the Viceroy most\r\nopportunely received letters from his master, disavowing the Colonna,\r\nand breathing affectionate duty to the Pontiff. He thereupon made\r\novertures of reconciliation, and after various demurs, prompted\r\nby the Pontiff's vacillating hopes and fears, but which, in the\r\nexhausted state of his treasury, appear the dictates of insanity,\r\nan eight months' truce was signed on the 15th of March, between the\r\nPope and the Emperor. It provided for a mutual restitution of all\r\nconquests in Lower Italy, a restoration of the Colonna to their\r\nestates and honours, and a payment by his Holiness of 60,000 ducats\r\ntowards the costs of the war. Should the French and Venetians accept\r\nof this truce, the lansquenets were to be withdrawn from Italy; at\r\nall events they and the Constable Bourbon's army were forthwith to\r\nquit the ecclesiastical and Florentine territories. Whilst intimating\r\nthis arrangement to the Duke of Urbino, by a brief of the 16th of\r\nMarch, Clement represents it as dictated by stern necessity, the\r\nwhole weight of the war having fallen upon himself, and as the sole\r\nmeans of saving his own existence, and preserving \"all Italy from\r\ndestruction.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst these events were in progress in Lower Italy, the negotiations\r\nfor a general peace had produced no fruits, conducted, as they were,\r\nwith little good faith or honesty of purpose. The only one really\r\ninterested in prolonging the struggle was Francis I., whose children\r\nwere still in his rival's hands. The Italian states, weary of a\r\nbootless contest, and disgusted by the feeble egotism of Clement,\r\nfell into inertness akin, perhaps, to the fascination under which the\r\nfeathered tribes are said to become victims of their reptile-foe.\r\n\r\nThat foe was Charles Duke of Bourbon, son of Gilbert Count de\r\nMontpensier, who died at Pozzuoli, in 1495, by Chiara Gonzaga,\r\nsister of Elisabetta Duchess of Urbino. He was next heir to the\r\ncrown of France, after Francis Duke of Angoulême, who succeeded to\r\nit as Francis I., and Charles Duke d'Alençon, whose blood had been\r\nattainted for treason. Louis XII., having removed this attainder,\r\nand restored the d'Alençon branch to their rights, incurred the deep\r\ndispleasure of Bourbon, who was, however, pacified by receiving, at\r\nthe age of twenty-six, the office of grand constable,--the highest\r\ndignity of the realm. He greatly distinguished himself in Francis's\r\nearly Italian campaigns, but was recalled from the command at Milan\r\nin 1516, in consequence of his overbearing conduct and ambitious\r\nviews. By Anna, sister of Charles VIII., whom he married in spite\r\nof a hideously deformed person, he had the dukedom of Bourbon,\r\nwith an immense fortune; but his extravagant prodigality plunged\r\nhim into great embarrassments, and a suit brought after his wife's\r\ndeath by the mother of Francis I.--whose love he was alleged to\r\nhave slighted--threatened him with utter ruin, by evicting him\r\nfrom his wife's estates. In these circumstances, his jealous and\r\nfiery temper was ready to seize upon any pretext for entering into\r\ntreasonable correspondence with the Emperor and King of England;\r\nand, on a promise of the crown of Provence, he undertook to head an\r\ninsurrection in France as soon as Francis should cross the Alps. That\r\nmonarch having discovered the plot, at once sought the Constable in\r\none of his own castles, and frankly told him what he had learned.\r\nThe hypocrite had recourse to abject asseverations of innocence and\r\nfidelity, and was ordered to attend his sovereign into Italy; but,\r\nperceiving that his protestations had not removed suspicion, he fled\r\nin disguise to the territory of Charles, and was declared rebel. His\r\nperfidy and rancour now knew no bounds; he was ever after prominent\r\nand indefatigable in the wars against his country, and mainly\r\ninstigated the descent upon Provence in 1524. He next entertained\r\na hope of the dukedom of Milan, by Clement's sanction; but he had\r\nplayed away his honour in a losing game: despised by himself and\r\nhis employers, the prestige of success passed from his arms. Yet\r\nhis peculiar talent for courting popularity ensured him the zealous\r\nsupport of his troops, who knew also that a bankrupt in character\r\nand purse was the best leader for men intent upon pillage. To the\r\nsingle merit of a winning manner, he united many odious qualities.\r\nHis unmeasured ambition was restrained by no principle, either\r\nas to its objects, or the means of attaining them. His pride was\r\nvain-glory, venting itself in capricious and ill-directed schemes,\r\nand stimulating into fury a wayward and sanguinary temper, which,\r\nwhen exasperated by exile and outlawry, became ungovernable.\r\n\r\nDuring the war of Lombardy, the imperial generals were in a great\r\nmeasure left to their own resources, both as to its conduct and its\r\nsupplies. Bourbon had for about a year maintained his army in Milan\r\nwithout pay, by merciless plunder of the townspeople, upon whom\r\ninsult and outrage were unsparingly heaped. But their patience and\r\ntheir means were nearly exhausted, and the difficulty of recruiting\r\nhis commissariat was greatly aggravated by judicious dispositions of\r\nthe allied army, directed by the Duke of Urbino. A forward movement\r\nwas therefore resolved upon, and as occupation and pillage were the\r\nonly chances of keeping together such disorganised troops, he led\r\nthem in search of both. Indifferent whether the spoils of Florence or\r\nRomagna should prove the more convenient prey, he effected a junction\r\nwith Fründesberg's new levies, whose circumstances and objects\r\nexactly corresponded with those of his own forces, and on the 30th of\r\nJanuary their united divisions passed the Po.\r\n\r\nOur authorities are in many respects contradictory regarding these\r\noperations, and especially as to the part which Francesco Maria took\r\nin them. He seems to have been laid up at Parma, with an attack of\r\ngout and fever, from the 3rd to the 14th of January, and to have\r\nspent most of the next two months with his Duchess at Gazzuolo in the\r\nMantuese, for recovery of his health. It is insinuated by Sismondi\r\nthat this was but an excuse for abandoning the field, at a moment\r\nwhen it would have been scarcely possible to pursue the policy, which\r\nthat author ascribes to him, of never risking in a general action the\r\nprestige of invincibility. On the other hand, Leoni asserts that, at\r\na council of war held in Parma on the 11th of February, plans for\r\nthe campaign were proposed in writing by the different confederate\r\nleaders, when that sent by the Duke was treacherously suppressed\r\nby Guicciardini. Judging from the results of the campaign, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the imperialists ought to have been attacked\r\nat this juncture; and if a general onset had been ordered on the\r\n13th of March, when they broke out into open mutiny, Bourbon being\r\nobliged to fly for his life, or, a few days after, when Fründesberg,\r\na monster of sacrilege and blasphemy, according to the Italian\r\nhistorians, died of apoplexy, they would in all probability have\r\nbeen totally exterminated. But they were the reserved instrument of\r\ndivine judgments; and it signifies little now to speculate whether\r\nthe immediate motives which paralysed the League were the Duke's\r\nill-timed caution, his anticipation that the starving band would ere\r\nlong of itself dissolve, or his personal enmity to the Pope. It is,\r\nhowever, important to keep in view the cold and selfish character of\r\nVenetian policy, and the hampering influence which their system of\r\n_proveditori_ necessarily had upon the measures of their generals.\r\n\r\nWhen Francesco Maria returned to the camp, the imperialists, who had\r\npassed the Trebbia on the 20th of February, were slowly advancing\r\nthrough the ecclesiastical state of Modena upon Bologna. His tactic\r\nwas to place them between two hostile armies; so the Marquis of\r\nSaluzzo, with the French, ecclesiastical, and Swiss troops, preceded\r\nthem, leaving garrisons in the principal places, the Duke following\r\nwith the Venetians, some thirty miles in their rear. Against this\r\nplan, which Guicciardini designates a strange proceeding, and\r\nwhich even Baldi most justly criticises, the other leaders vainly\r\nprotested, alleging, among other reasons, that whilst the army\r\nin advance must be speedily weakened by detaching garrisons, the\r\nVenetians would probably hang back when their own frontier was freed\r\nfrom danger. News of the truce between the Pope and the Viceroy now\r\narrived, and the Duke, disgusted at this new proof of Clement's\r\nfickleness, and indifference to his allies' interests, withdrew\r\nhis army across the Po. But the courier who brought the treaty to\r\nBourbon at Ponte-Reno, with an order to obey its provisions, was\r\nnearly cut to pieces by his troops, infuriated at this interference\r\nwith their hopes of booty, and the Constable refused to abide by\r\nit. The fresh jealousy of their unstable ally, thus suggested to\r\nthe Venetians, afforded their leader a new apology for not exposing\r\ntheir troops in a general action for the preservation of Bologna.\r\nBut when Bourbon had passed by that city towards Romagna and Urbino,\r\nsomewhat more spirit was infused into his movements, as the danger\r\nseemed to approach his own frontier. He immediately sent forward\r\ntwo thousand men to protect the duchy, and desired his family to\r\nbe removed for safety to Venice. On the 5th of March he had struck\r\nhis camp at Casal-Maggiore, and proceeded in pursuit of the enemy.\r\nOn that day they passed under Imola, which, with the other cities,\r\nwas garrisoned by detachments of Saluzzo, in accordance with tactics\r\nalready explained. Bourbon now scoured the plains of Romagna in\r\nsearch of plunder, skirmishing occasionally with the French division.\r\nWhen at Meldola on the 14th he bethought him of a descent upon Siena,\r\nwhose old Ghibelline and anti-Florentine preferences promised him a\r\nwelcome. He, therefore, penetrated the Apennines by forced marches\r\nup the passes of the Bidente, and on the 18th reached S. Pietro in\r\nBagno, burning and pillaging as he went.\r\n\r\nWhen the Constable's refusal to accept the treaty was known at Rome,\r\nClement, more perplexed than ever, besought Lanoy to hurry on and\r\ninduce him to a halt, or at all events to withdraw the Spaniards and\r\nmen-at-arms from his command. To this the Viceroy with much apparent\r\nzeal consented; but doubts have been thrown on his sincerity, for\r\nboth he and Moncada, whilst professing cordial co-operation with the\r\nPope, are suspected of having secretly stimulated Bourbon's advance\r\nupon Rome, as the only means of appeasing the troops, trusting that\r\nthe grandeur of the enterprise would, in their master's eyes, readily\r\nexcuse its criminality. It seems doubtful whether Lanoy actually met\r\nthe Constable; and his mission was understood to have exposed him\r\nto great personal risk from the lawless and ungovernable troops. He\r\nat all events conveyed to Bourbon a proposition for the immediate\r\npayment to his army of 80,000 ducats, with 60,000 more during May,\r\non condition of their retreat within five days; these sums to be\r\nadvanced by Florence, on the Viceroy's guarantee for repayment of\r\none-half by the Emperor. The direct object of this proposal was to\r\ndivert the impending storm from Tuscany; and it was fully sanctioned\r\nby Clement, true to the policy of Medicean pontiffs, who ever\r\nregarded Florence as their patrimony, Rome as their life-interest. In\r\nthe negotiations to which it gave rise there was a double difficulty.\r\nWhilst the demands of a mutinous and starving army were paramount to\r\nall other considerations, each party of the confederates struggled to\r\nthrow upon another the burden of meeting them. The same selfishness\r\nsought individual security against the future movements of the\r\ngeneral foe, by turning him upon some friendly frontier. The wealthy\r\nFlorentines lavished their gold to send him back upon Upper Italy,\r\nwhich the timely distribution of a few thousand men in the Apennine\r\ngorges might have prevented him from ever quitting. The game of the\r\nProveditore Pisani was to leave no obstacle in the way of his advance\r\nin any direction save that of the Venetian terra-firma domain, and\r\nto detain the Duke of Urbino with his army of observation as long as\r\npossible near that frontier. The French strove at all hazards to keep\r\nhim clear of their Lombard conquests. The Pontiff, little dreaming\r\nof an attack upon his capital, was distracted between the care of\r\nRomagna and Tuscany, whilst his fickle imbecility deprived him of all\r\nsympathy at his allies' hands; indeed, in this conflict of interests,\r\nhis pusillanimous tergiversations rendered him the weaker vessel,\r\nand he consequently became the chief sufferer. Nor did the Duke of\r\nUrbino escape suspicions of bad faith, for he is accused of a secret\r\nunderstanding not to impede Bourbon's descent upon Tuscany, which\r\nwould naturally liberate his own duchy from danger. Guicciardini,\r\nindeed, not only considers revenge for former injuries of the Medici\r\nas the key to Francesco Maria's dilatory and inefficient proceedings\r\nagainst the imperialists, but regards his conduct as justified by the\r\nprovocations received. These sentiments were at all events cherished\r\nby the soldiery of Urbino, who wrote \"FOR VENGEANCE\" upon\r\nthe houses which they fired on their march through the Florentine\r\nterritory. Nor were these provocations light, for the grudge which\r\nLeo had bequeathed was aggravated by a continued retention of the\r\nfortresses in Montefeltro, and still more by an investiture of the\r\nentire duchy, granted in 1525 by Clement, in total defiance of\r\nthe della Rovere rights, to Ascanio Colonna, whose claims we have\r\nalready considered.[310] This grant, though virtually annulled by the\r\nsame Pope's subsequent confirmation of the reinvestiture given to\r\nFrancesco Maria by Adrian VI., gave rise to renewed anxieties on his\r\npart about two years later, and it was not until 1530 that we shall\r\nsee them finally extinguished by the Duke's generous hospitality to\r\nhis rival.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: Above, p. 420.]\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of April the Constable, finding the mountain peasantry\r\nexasperated to a dangerous pitch by the merciless rigours of his\r\nlawless soldiery, and his own sanguinary nature being goaded by their\r\nribald taunts, cut short these miserable intrigues by advancing into\r\nTuscany.[*311] The confederate leaders, having at length decided\r\non saving Florence, united their divisions, and on the 25th passed\r\nthe Apennines near the present Bologna road. The Duke now received\r\nan offer of his fortresses of S. Leo and Maiuolo, which still\r\nremained pledged to that commonwealth. This he answered by general\r\nprofessions, and next day, sending on the army to Incisa to intercept\r\nthe approach of Bourbon, he proceeded with a band of faithful\r\nfollowers to the Tuscan capital. The republican faction, calculating\r\nupon his support, flew to arms and seized the Palazzo Vecchio, while\r\nonce more the unpopular sway of the Medici trembled in the balance.\r\nBut the Duke, with a nobility of purpose that goes far to absolve\r\nhim from suspicion as to his good faith with the Pope throughout\r\nthis campaign, rejected the temptation of avenging his many wrongs,\r\nand, by extraordinary personal exertions, succeeded in quelling the\r\ninsurrection, and maintaining the established government. Thus, for\r\nthe first time, the city saw its Palazzo taken without a revolution\r\nfollowing. In gratitude for this service his fortresses were\r\nimmediately given up to Francesco Maria, who in due time received\r\nalso the thanks of his Holiness. The act for their restitution was\r\nsigned on the 1st of May, and on the 14th S. Leo was surrendered to\r\nhis lieutenant Orazio Florido.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *311: He halted at S. Giovanni in Val d'Arno, where, though\r\nhe ought never to have been allowed to come so far, he might have\r\nbeen easily crushed in that narrow pass. But if the Duke of Urbino\r\nshowed now a certain activity, it was not of the sort to crush this\r\nadventure. Bourbon wheeled into the Via Francigena and marched down\r\nto Rome and death. \"To Rome! to Rome!\" were his dying words.]\r\n\r\nBourbon's head-quarters were meanwhile at Montevarchi, near\r\nArezzo, where, seeing his approach to Florence foiled, and the\r\ndissatisfaction of his followers on the increase, he decided upon\r\nmaking a dash at Rome; his only alternative being to lead them to\r\npillage, or perish at their hands. As a blind to the Pope, he sent\r\nforward a courier to demand free passage to Naples; and, after\r\nreceiving some supplies from Siena, he abandoned his artillery and\r\nheavy baggage in order to lighten his march. He began it on the 26th,\r\nand, notwithstanding incessant rains and an entirely disorganised\r\ncommissariat, he passed without halt or question by Acquapendente and\r\nViterbo to Rome.[312]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: Many facts regarding the war in Lombardy and the march\r\nto Rome are given by Baldi (Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 906) with a minuteness\r\nand impartiality not found in other writers. The feeble views of\r\nClement are illustrated by his brieves to the Duke of Urbino, noticed\r\nin I. of the Appendix to our next volume.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n(Pages 33, 34)\r\n\r\nPORTRAITS OF CESARE BORGIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same extremes of reprobation and flattery which alternate\r\nin notices of the Duke Valentino puzzle us as to his personal\r\nappearance. Giovio, the ardent collector of historical portraits,\r\nwhile describing those which he had brought together, thus comments\r\nupon that of Borgia:--\"He is said to come of a plague-stricken stock\r\nand of corrupted blood; for a livid rush overspread his face, which\r\nwas full of pimples shedding matter. His eyes, too, were deeply\r\nsunk, and their fierce snake-like glance seemed to flash fire, so\r\nthat even his friends and comrades could not bear to look upon them;\r\nyet, while flirting with the ladies, he had a wonderful knack of\r\nplaying the agreeable.\" The pen which inscribed these sentences was\r\nevidently charged with even more than its wonted gall; but, after\r\nevery allowance, they cannot well be reconciled with a report of the\r\nVenetian envoy Capello, dated in 1500, and bearing that \"the Pope\r\nloves and greatly fears his son the Duke, who is aged twenty-seven\r\nyears; his head is most beautiful; he is tall and well made, and\r\nhandsomer than King Ferdinand.\"\r\n\r\nNor can we attain to any more satisfactory conclusion from such\r\npictures as are alleged to transmit his features. We have no key to\r\nidentify as his any of the heads introduced by Pinturicchio into\r\nthose fine but little noticed frescoes commissioned by Alexander\r\nVI. for the Torre di Borgia, now a wing of the Vatican Library. The\r\nexquisite medallists of Romagna do not appear to have exercised their\r\nskill upon his bust. Of easel portraits I am aware of six, which I\r\nmention for the curious in such matters, although not prepared to\r\nconsider any of them genuine.\r\n\r\n1. The elegant effeminate-looking Spaniard in the Borghese Gallery,\r\nattributed to Raffaele, is now admitted to be a misnomer both of\r\nsubject and artist.\r\n\r\n2. A mean head, in the manner of Federigo Zuccaro, was purchased\r\na few years ago at Rome by my late friend Monsignor Laureani,\r\nlibrarian of the Vatican, as that of Valentino, and passed from\r\nhim, in 1844, to my friend the Cavaliere Campana. Its sinister and\r\nspiteful expression is not unworthy of such a monster; and allowing\r\nan artist's licence in disguising a complexion which no one would\r\nwillingly represent, it might tally with Giovio's too graphic\r\ndetails. The figure is, however, short, while Capello describes\r\nCesare as tall.\r\n\r\n3. A letter from Giuseppe Vallardi to Count Cesare di Castelbarco\r\nVisconti was privately printed at Milan in 1843, in which he claims\r\nto have discovered in the Count's palace a portrait of Borgia by\r\nRaffaele, the original chalk study of which belonged to himself. From\r\nthe mass of verbiage usual in similar Italian effusions of \"municipal\r\nfanaticism,\" there may be extracted an allegation that the picture\r\nhad been painted from that earlier drawing about 1508, and a bold\r\ninference is hazarded from their style that both were the handiwork\r\nof Sanzio. The lithograph, however, would entitle us to ascribe them\r\nrather to the Milanese school, and such is admitted to be the opinion\r\nof various connoisseurs. No fact is adduced to authenticate the head,\r\nor to show that Raffaele ever saw Valentino; indeed, the name seems\r\nto libel a countenance so gentle, refined, and unimpassioned.\r\n\r\n4. Vallardi mentions in the same letter another Borgian head, by\r\nGiorgione, as in the Lochis Gallery at Bergamo, of which I cannot\r\nspeak, not having seen it.\r\n\r\n5. A handsome over-dressed youth was engraved for Gordon's _Life of\r\nAlexander VI._, in 1729, from a picture said to belong to D. Giuseppe\r\nValetta of Naples, which I entirely failed in tracing while in Italy.\r\nNeither have I discovered any authority for supposing that soulless\r\nepicurean to be Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may include Fuseli's notice of a picture by Titian,\r\nno longer, however, in the Borghese collection, representing a\r\nconference between the Usurper of Romagna and Machiavelli. A finer\r\nsubject for the pencil of that intellectual limner could hardly be\r\nfound, but Valentino's prodigality was apparently never lavished on\r\nart.[313] In his eleventh lecture, Fuseli also mentions a portrait of\r\nCesare by Giorgione, as hanging for study in the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: In Leonardo da Vinci he saw only a military engineer.\r\nHis commission, desiring that great genius to survey and report\r\nupon all his fortresses, in the summer of 1502, is quoted in\r\nBROWN'S _Life of Leonardo_, p. 118, and accordingly Urbino\r\nwas visited by him on the 30th of July.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\n(Page 34)\r\n\r\nDUKE GUIDOBALDO I. OF URBINO A KNIGHT OF THE GARTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of all early records of the Order, in consequence of their\r\nhaving long been entrusted to the private and insecure custody of\r\nits successive officers, has already placed us at disadvantage in\r\nnoticing the admission of Duke Federigo, but from various sources\r\nwe are enabled to glean much more satisfactory notices as to the\r\nelection and installation of his son to this honourable knighthood.\r\nThe chapter at which he was chosen is not preserved by Anstis, but\r\nits date is known from the following letter, the original of which,\r\nin Latin, I had the good fortune to discover in the Oliveriana\r\nLibrary at Pesaro.[314]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: MSS. No. 374, vol. I., p. 55.]\r\n\r\n     \"Henry, by the grace of God, King of England and France,\r\n     Lord of Ireland, to the most illustrious and potent\r\n     Prince the Lord Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, our most\r\n     dear friend, health and augmented prosperity. We wrote\r\n     lately to inform your Highness that we had resolved upon\r\n     forthwith summoning a chapter of our military Order of the\r\n     Garter, for the purpose of creating your Sublimity a knight\r\n     thereof, and by the same letters gave you tidings of such\r\n     creation. We have now to signify how, in fulfilment of that\r\n     our promise, we have made your Highness a Knight of that\r\n     Order; and this we have done most cordially, not only on\r\n     account of our old necessity, which formerly occurred to\r\n     us with your father the illustrious Duke of happy memory,\r\n     but also in consideration of your singular merit and\r\n     virtues. Indeed we are assured that henceforward your\r\n     Highness will ever be regarded as our most attached cousin\r\n     and intimate friend, which you will more fully learn from\r\n     our distinguished cousin the Lord Talbot, a knight of that\r\n     Order, as also from the Reverend [Richard Bere] Lord Abbot\r\n     of Glastonbury, and the Venerable Sir Robert Shirbourn,\r\n     Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, our counsellors and\r\n     ambassadors, whom we have sent to offer our catholic and\r\n     filial obedience to our supreme Lord [Julius II.]. To these\r\n     our envoys we have committed all the knightly insignia\r\n     of the Garter, to be made over to your Highness, and our\r\n     anxious desire is that you will accept them in the same\r\n     spirit of cordial affection in which they are sent. We pray\r\n     you further to receive these our ambassadors as accredited\r\n     in our behalf, and that you will please to aid them with\r\n     your favour and counsels, which will be to us peculiarly\r\n     agreeable. Finally, as the Venerable Mr. Robert Shirbourn,\r\n     one of these our envoys, is by our command to remain for\r\n     some time as our minister at the Roman Court to transact\r\n     certain affairs of ours with our Lord his Holiness, we\r\n     therefore beseech your Sublimity that you will vouchsafe\r\n     to assist him, as our agent, with your gracious influence,\r\n     which has great and just weight with our Holy Father, and\r\n     that you will extend to him such favours as he may request;\r\n     by all which you will do us a singular pleasure. Further,\r\n     if it be in our power any way to oblige you, freely make\r\n     use of us and ours. From our palace near Westminster, the\r\n     20th of February, 1503-4.[315]\r\n\r\n     \"HENRICUS REX.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: It is pleasant to find the arts from time to time\r\nbecoming handmaids of history as well as of religion; and the\r\nfriendly feeling for England then cherished at Urbino is curiously\r\nillustrated by a bequest of Bishop Arrivabene, who, in 1504, left 400\r\ngolden scudi to be expended in decorating a chapel, dedicated to St.\r\nMartin and St. Thomas of Canterbury: the Duchess Elisabetta was one\r\nof the trustees, and the fresco ordered by them from Girolamo Genga\r\nincluded a representation of the English saint, and a portrait of\r\nDuke Guidobaldo.]\r\n\r\nThe instructions to these ambassadors, dated the 20th of February,\r\nand printed by Anstis, run thus:--\r\n\r\n\"And after due recommendacions, and presentaciones of the Kinge's\r\nlettres [to Duke Guidobaldo], firste the saide Abbot of Glastonburye\r\nshall make a brefe oracion, wherein he shall not onlye touche the\r\nlaudes of the noble Order of the Garter, and of the Kinges Highnes\r\nas sovereigne of the same, but also declare the great vertues and\r\nnotable deades of the saide Duke, and how his progenitors and\r\nauncestors have been accepted thereunto, and to theyr greate honor\r\nhave used the same, with the desyrous mynde that the sayde Duke is to\r\nbe honored therwithal; for the which consideracions and causes the\r\nKinge's Highness, by the assent of the Companions of that Order, have\r\nbeen the rather moved and induced to name and elect him thereunto,\r\ntrustinge verelie that, his greate noblenesse with other of his\r\nvaliant actes and singuler vertues consydered, he shall not onlye\r\ngreatlye honor the saide Order, but also take greate honor by the\r\nsame.

But he\r\ntaried not the comming of those ambassadors, for within a moneth\r\nafter that he was installed, he rendered his debt to nature, and so\r\nhad short pleasure of his promotion.... The King caused Guidebald,\r\nDuke of Urbine, to be elected Knight of the Order of the Garter, in\r\nlike manner as his father Duke Frederike had been before him, which\r\nwas chosen and admitted into the Order by King Edward the Fourth. Sir\r\nGilbert Talbot, and the other two ambassadors, being appointed to\r\nkeepe on their journey unto Pope Julius the Second, elected after the\r\ndeath of the said Pius the Third, bare the habit, and collar also,\r\nunto the said Duke Guidebald.\"[316] It must, however, be observed\r\nthat letters of safe conduct for these ambassadors are stated to have\r\nbeen issued under the Privy Seal on the 22nd of February, 1504, as if\r\nbut then beginning their journey. This mission was in accordance with\r\nthe statutes of the Order, which provided that, within four months\r\nof the election, special messengers should be despatched to invest\r\neach foreign knight with the insignia, and that, within eight months\r\nafter the investiture, he should send a proctor to England to receive\r\ninstallation in his name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: Hall quaintly says that the King intended \"to stop two\r\ngappes with one bushe.\"]\r\n\r\nWe learn from Burchard that the three envoys reached Rome the 12th\r\nof May, 1504. They were met by Sylvester Gigli, Bishop of Worcester,\r\nAnglican resident at the papal court, and had a splendid reception.\r\nOn the 20th they had an audience, when, the minister of Louis XII.\r\nhaving protested against Henry taking the style of France, they\r\nwere admitted as the ambassadors of England only. No details have\r\nreached us of the investiture. The authority to which we naturally\r\nturn for the circumstances attending this interesting episode of our\r\nnarrative is Polydoro di Vergilio, a native of Urbino, and historian\r\nof England; but a fact, which to the writer ought to have been of\r\npeculiar importance, is passed over without details. As, however,\r\nthe supposed autograph copy of his History varies considerably from\r\nprinted editions, we shall here quote from it the entire passage,\r\nproving the incorrect manner in which this work is given to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\"Alexandro Sexto mortuo, creatus est Pontifex Franciscus, Senensis\r\nantistes, qui Pii fuit Secundi ex sorore nepos, voluitque et ipse\r\nPius Tertius in memoria avunculi vocari.

Sed Pius non expectavit gratulationem, qui obiit sexto\r\net vigesimo die quam sedere coeperat. Creatur in ejus locum Julianus,\r\nCardinalis Sti. Petri ad Vincula, patria Ligur, dictusque est Julius\r\nSecundus. Huic postea illi tres regis oratores congratulatum inerunt,\r\nquos Hadrianus Castellensis episcopus Herefordensis, quem paulo\r\nante Alexander Cardinalem fecerat, Romæ hospitio excepit. Hunc rex\r\nHenricus sub idem tempus ab Herefordensi sede ad Bathoniensem ac\r\nWellensem transferri curavit. At Hadrianus, ut præter sua quotidiana\r\nobsequia, quæ tam regi quam Anglis omnibus libens præstabat, aliquo\r\ndiuturniori memoriæ monumento relinqueret, apud omnes testatum se\r\nmemorem fuisse acceptorum beneficiorum ab Henrico, atque nomen\r\nAnglicum amasse, donavit regi palatium magnificum quod ipse Romæ\r\nin Vaticano ædificaverat, ornavitque regis insignibus, ut in\r\nea luce hominum aliquod egregium opus nomini Anglico dedicatum\r\nconspiceretur.[317] Item, iidem oratores detulerunt habitum Garterii\r\nordinis Guidoni Duci Urbini, principi seculo nostro Latinæ Linguæ\r\nsimul ac Græcæ ac militaris disciplinæ peritissimo, quem Rex paulo\r\nante in Collegium ipsius Ordinis asciverat. Dux postea destinavit\r\nin Angliam Baldasarem Castilliorum, natione Mantuanum, equitem tam\r\ndoctrinâ quam bellicâ virtute præstantem, ut suo nomine ejus Ordinis\r\ncerimonias exequeret. Fuit Baldaser ab Henrico perbenigne exceptus,\r\natque comiter habitus; qui, finitis ceremoniis, non indonatus,\r\npostmodum ad suum Decem redivit.\"[318]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: The palace thus gifted to Henry is believed to have\r\nbeen that in Borgo, called Palazzo Giraud, in which many of our\r\ncountrymen have of late received the splendid hospitalities of Prince\r\nTorlonia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 498, f. 273. For Polydoro di\r\nVergilio, see above, pp. 115-18.]\r\n\r\nThere is thus no authority for a statement in the printed version of\r\nthis History, adopted by Hall, Baldi, and others, that the decoration\r\nwas conferred in consequence of Guidobaldo's own wish to belong to\r\nan Order, of whose illustration he had become cognisant from its\r\nhaving been borne by his father. Perhaps the requests which conclude\r\nthe letter of Henry VII. may give the most satisfactory key to the\r\nroyal policy. Informed, as he no doubt was, of the state of affairs\r\nat the Papal court, he must have been aware that to conciliate the\r\nDuke was the wisest course for those who had favours to gain from the\r\nPontiff. Be this as it may, the Garter was received by Guidobaldo at\r\nRome in June, as became so singular an honour, and was proudly worn\r\nnext St. George's day in compliance with the rules of the Order.\r\nHaving resolved suitably so to acknowledge the dignity by a special\r\nenvoy to London, he selected as his proctor Castiglione, the choicest\r\nspirit of his elegant court. The first we hear of this intention is\r\nfrom the Count's letter of 2nd March, 1505, confidently informing\r\nhis mother that he would probably be sent to represent his master\r\nat his installation in England. The plan, however, remained long in\r\nabeyance. Castiglione spent the autumn at the baths of S. Casciano in\r\nTuscany, for an old injury or wound in his foot, and, in the end of\r\nthe year, went on a mission to Ferrara.[319] At length he set out,\r\non the 24th of July, 1506, accompanied by Francesco di Battista di\r\nRicece, and Giulio da Cagli, with their respective suites. Among the\r\npresents he was charged to deliver to the King were some falcons,\r\nthree of the finest racers of the Urbino breed, and a precious\r\nlittle picture, by Raffaele, of St. George as patron of the English\r\nOrder, which we have already mentioned at p. 233. He was at Lyons in\r\nSeptember, and this notice of his arrival at Dover is preserved by\r\nAnstis:--\r\n\r\n\"The 20th of Octobre, the twenty-second year of our soverain lord,\r\nKing Henry VII., there landed at Dover a noble ambassadeur, sent\r\nfrom the Duc of Urbin, called Sir Balthasar de Castilione, whiche\r\ncame to be installed in his lorde's name; whiche Duc had receyved\r\nbefore by the Abbot of Glastonbury and Sir Gilbert Talbott, being the\r\nKing's commissionaris, the Garetier, &c., to the Ordre apperteyning.\r\nAnd, to mete with the said ambassadeur, was sent Sir Thomas Brandon,\r\nhavyng a goodly companye with hym of his owne servants, all verely\r\nwell horsed, unto the see-seyde; whiche, after they met togedre,\r\nkept contynnually compagnie with hym, and, when they approched nere\r\nto Deptford, ther met with the forsaid ambassadeur by the King's\r\ncommandement, the Lord Thomas Dokara, lord of St. John's, and Thomas\r\nWrithesley, alias Gartier princypall king of Armes. Whiche lord of\r\nSt. John's had in his compaignie thirty of his servaunts, all in\r\na lyvery new, well horsed, every [one] of his gentlemen beryng a\r\njavelayn in his hand, and every yeman havying his bowe and a sheffe\r\nof arrowes, and soe convoyed hym to his lodging, and on the morrow\r\nunto London. And by the waye ther met with the said ambassadeur\r\ndyvers Italyens, as the Pope's Vicecollector, Paulus de Gygeles\r\n[Giliis], with dyvers [others]; and soe convoyed hym to the Pope's\r\nVicecollector's hows, wher he was lodged.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: I can find nothing in support of Roscoe's assertion\r\nthat he was wounded while aiding Guidobaldo to recover his duchy, and\r\nthe whole facts seem to contradict it. _Leo X._, ch. vii., § 7, note.\r\nThat usually accurate writer has fallen into the mistake of ascribing\r\nto the Count's _sister_ his interment and monumental inscription in\r\nthe church of the Minims, near Mantua, while the epitaph which he has\r\nprinted, bears that Aloysia Gonzaga placed it over a worthy _son_,\r\nwhom she unwillingly survived. Several dates in our text are supplied\r\nfrom Vat. Urb. MSS. No. 904, p. 43.]\r\n\r\nTwo days after Castiglione reached London he was sent for by the\r\nKing, whose marked favour, whilst he stated the objects of his\r\nmission in an eloquent Latin address, is recorded in his own letters.\r\nThe installation took place on the 10th of November, upon the\r\nfollowing commission, printed by Ashmole:--\r\n\r\n\"Henry, by the grace of God, &c. Forasmuch as we understand that\r\nthe right noble prince Gwe de Ubaldis, Duke of Urbin, who was\r\nheretofore elected to be one of the companions of the said noble\r\nOrder, cannot conveniently repair into this our realm, personally to\r\nbe installed in the collegiate church of that Order, and to perform\r\nother ceremonies whereunto by the statutes of the said Order he is\r\nbound, but for that intent and purpose hath sent a right honourable\r\npersonage, Balthasar de Castilione, Knight, sufficiently authorised\r\nas his proctor, to be installed in his name, and to perform all other\r\nthings for him, to the statutes and ordinances of the said Order\r\nrequisite and appertaining. We, therefore, in consideration of the\r\npremises, will, and by these presents, give unto you licence, full\r\npower, and authority, not only to accept and admit the said Balthasar\r\nas proctor for the same Duke, and to receive his oath and instal him\r\nin the lieu and place and for the said Duke, but also farther, to do\r\ntherein as to the statutes and laudable usages of the said Order it\r\nappertaineth; and this our writing shall be to you and every of you\r\nsufficient discharge in that behalf. Given under the seale of our\r\nsaid noble Order of the Garter, at our mannor of Grenewiche, the 7th\r\nday of November, the twenty-second year of our reign.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremonial was concluded, the Count visited the other\r\nknights in the name of his master. This installation by proxy has\r\ngiven rise to a confusion that he was himself honoured with the\r\nGarter, which Roscoe first exposed. It is probable, however, that\r\nhe was knighted by Henry, a dignity he had vainly looked for at the\r\nhand of Julius II. before his departure; at all events he received\r\nfrom him, besides gifts of horses and dogs, a gold chain or collar\r\nof SS links, from which depended two portcullises and a golden rose\r\nwith its centre of silver. This chain, long peculiar to English chief\r\njustices, is traced by Dugdale from the initials of Saint Simplicius,\r\na primitive Christian judge and martyr; and the badge was adopted\r\nby that monarch as heir of the Plantagenets through both rival\r\nroses. The decoration, mistaken by Marliani for the collar of the\r\nGarter, was destined by the Count as an heirloom, and it accordingly\r\nsurrounded his armorial coat in that dedication copy of his letter\r\nto Henry, narrating the life of Guidobaldo, which he described by\r\nAnstis. On the 9th of February, 1507, he was at Milan on his return\r\nto Urbino, where he arrived about the end of the month, charged with\r\naffectionate letters and messages from Henry, and with rich presents.\r\nHis conversation, of all that he had seen in a country so imperfectly\r\nknown, was greatly relished by the Duke, and his anecdotes of its\r\ncourt, its wealth, and its wonders long continued to enliven the\r\npalace-circle of Montefeltro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\n(Page 138)\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI SANZI'S MS. CHRONICLE OF FEDERIGO DUKE OF URBINO\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the importance of Sanzi's Rhyming Chronicle of Duke\r\nFederigo to the literary history of Urbino, and the almost total\r\nneglect in which it has hitherto lain, we shall here describe with\r\nsome minuteness the only copy of it known to exist. It is a large\r\nand thick folio volume, No. 1305 of the Ottoboniana MSS. in the\r\nVatican Library, written on paper in a firm Italian hand of the\r\nfifteenth century, expressly for the Duke Guidobaldo I., to whom it\r\nis dedicated. Some passages have been interpolated on the margin, and\r\nothers are altered by pasting a new version over the cancelled lines,\r\nin a character slightly different from that of the text, of which,\r\nbeing probably autograph, a fac-simile is given on the following\r\npage.[320]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: This marginal interpolation, occurring in the\r\ndedication, runs thus:--\"Pregandoti humilmente ryguardi ly gloriosi\r\nfatti del tuo famoso padre, e non la basseza del myo style [not\r\n\"srypt,\" as Passavant reads it], ornato solo da me dy quella sincer\r\nfede che deue vn fydeli servo al suo signore.\"]\r\n\r\nThe general title, supplied in a much later hand, runs\r\nthus:--\"Historia della Guerra d'Italia nel tempo de' PP. Pio e Paolo\r\nII., del 1478, in versi di Gio[~v]. Sati al Duca di Urbino\"; but the\r\nChronicle itself is thus headed, \"Principio del opera composta da\r\nGiohanni Santi, pictore, nelaquale se contiene la vita e gesti de lo\r\nillustrissimo et invictissimo Principe Federico Feretrano, Duca di\r\nUrbino.\" A prose dedication occupies four pages, and is followed by a\r\nprologue of nine chapters in verse; the poem itself is divided into a\r\nhundred and four chapters, arranged in twenty-three books, the whole\r\nwork consisting of about twenty-four thousand lines.[321] It may be\r\nnot uninteresting to print the contents of these chapters, supplying\r\nthe omitted titles of the two first.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: Several errors in the numeration, both of the folios\r\nand chapters, might readily deceive a superficial observer, and have\r\nmisled even Passavant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Transcriber's Note: handwritten text; see footnote\r\n320 above]]\r\n\r\n     LIBRO PRIMO.\r\n\r\n     CAP.

IN 1511-13.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving no wish to overload these pages with a papal bull, either in\r\nits barbarous Latinity or in a crabbed translation, we shall content\r\nourselves with abbreviating the formal record of the investigation\r\nand sentence of absolution, dated the 9th of December, 1511, by\r\nwhich the Duke of Urbino was acquitted of the slaughter of the\r\nCardinal of Pavia. Julius, in that document, sets forth that, after\r\nreducing Bologna to obedience of the Church, he placed over it\r\nthe Cardinal as legate, who ungratefully betrayed his duty to the\r\nPope and the Church by secretly plotting for restoration of the\r\nBentivoglii, and for defeat of the army under command of the Duke,\r\nas well as by withdrawing to Ravenna on pretext of terror, but in\r\nfact to conceal his treason. That having, by these and many other\r\nenormities, incurred the guilt of treason and lèse-majesty, he was\r\nslain by Francesco Maria; and that, on a complaint of this outrage\r\nbeing preferred, his Holiness, judging from the first aspect of the\r\naffair that this crime against the dignity of the purple afforded so\r\npernicious an example, and such general horror and scandal abroad, as\r\nto require an impartial inquiry, had remitted it to six cardinals,\r\nin order to make sifting inquest into the matter, receiving secret\r\noral testimony, without reference to the ties of blood, but with\r\nample powers, judicial and extra-judicial, to carry out the process\r\nto its conclusion, and to pronounce sentence therein. And the\r\napostolic procurator-fiscal having appeared to support the charges,\r\nrequired the Duke's committal to prison ere he should be allowed\r\nto plead, in order to secure the due course of justice against any\r\nelusory proceedings; whereupon he was put under arrest in his own\r\nhouse, and bound over to appear in the sum of 100,000 golden ducats.\r\nThereafter, the judges having taken evidence and published it, the\r\nPope advocated the cause and pronounced an acquittal, which the\r\nDuke refused to accept, insisting that the prosecution should take\r\nits course, and returning under arrest until it should do so. This\r\nhaving been proceeded with, the cardinals gave sentence, acquitting\r\nhim \"of the said charge of homicide, and the punishment it legally\r\ninferred,\" and debarring all future action thereanent at the public\r\nprosecutor's instance. Whereupon Julius embodied this narrative in\r\na bull subscribed by eighteen cardinals, and formally guaranteed by\r\nthe amplest authority, as a protection to Francesco Maria against any\r\nfuture question affecting his tranquillity and status.[326]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: The notorial transumpt of this bull, verified in 1516\r\nby three notaries in presence of the municipality of Urbino, is\r\npreserved in the Archivio Diplomatico at Florence, and the preceding\r\nabridgment was made from an authenticated extract obtained by me\r\nthere in 1845. In the same archives there is another formal acquittal\r\nto the like purpose, which it is needless to quote.]\r\n\r\nThe remission of the Duke's subsequent misconduct was contained in\r\na papal brief of the 10th of January, 1513, addressed to himself,\r\nwherein it was stated that he had been accused by many of maintaining\r\nintelligence with the King of France before the battle of Ravenna,\r\nand of other intrigues against the Roman Government, as well as of\r\nvarious crimes, including slaughter of cardinals and lèse-majesty,\r\nand that he had in consequence been deprived of his dukedom and\r\ndignities; but that having experienced his zeal and good faith in\r\nthe like matters, the Pontiff could not persuade himself of his\r\nguilt, for which reason he, _ex motu proprio_, granted to him and his\r\nadherents plenary remission from all spiritual and temporal censures\r\nand sentences incurred therein, and restored him to all his honours\r\nand dignities. The entire wording of this document, the original of\r\nwhich is preserved along with the bull just quoted, shows a studious\r\nexactitude and elaboration of terms, so as to guard it against\r\nfuture question; but, considering its importance with reference to\r\nthe prosecution subsequently mooted against the Duke by Leo X., it\r\nmay be well here to give the _ipsissima verba_ of the remission\r\nclauses. The brief is addressed, but has no counter-signature; a\r\ntransumpt of it in the same archive has the name \"Baldassar Tuerdus\"\r\nas a counter-signature.\r\n\r\n\"Motu proprio, et ex certâ nostrâ scientiâ ac maturâ deliberatione,\r\net apostolice potestatis plenitudine, apostolicâ auctoritate, tenore\r\npresentium, tibi et illis plenarie remittimus pariter et indulgemus,\r\nteque ac illos, et illorum singulos, ab omnibus sententiis censuris\r\net penis quibuslibet, spiritualibus et temporalibus, a jure vel ab\r\nhomine quomodolibet promulgatis, auctoritate scientiâ et potestate\r\npredictis, absolvimus et liberamus, ac te tuosque filios, natos et\r\nnascituros ac heredes quoscunque, ad Vicariatum, Ducatum, Comitatus,\r\nteque ac subditos, adherentes, complices ac sequaces, ac singulorum\r\neorundem heredes, ad feuda, dominia, honores et dignitates, offitia,\r\nprivelegia, bona ac jura, ac ad actus legitimos, quibus forsan\r\npremissorum, et aliâ quâcunque occasione, etiam de necessitate\r\nexperimendâ privati, censeri possetis, auctoritate scientiâ et\r\npotestate premissis restituimus, et etiam reintegramus, et ad eundem\r\nstatum reducimus et reponimus, in quo tu et illi eratis ante tempus\r\nquo premissa commisissetis; districtius inhibentes quibuscunque\r\nofficialibus nostris, et dicte Ecclesie, qui sunt et pro tempore\r\nerunt, ne contra te et subditos, adherentes, complices et sequaces,\r\naut aliquem vestrum, occasione hujusmodi criminum possint procedere,\r\naut occasione premissorum te vel illos, aut aliquem eorum, molestare\r\nquoquo modo presumant; ac decernentes ex nunc irritum et inane\r\nquicquid ac quoscunque processus et sententias, quos seu quas\r\ncontra inhibitionem nostram hujusmodi haberi contigerit, seu etiam\r\npromulgari.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\n(Page 392)\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM CARDINAL WOLSEY TO LORENZO DE' MEDICI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter has been lately printed by the Marchese Caponi,\r\nin the _Archivio Storico Italiano_, vol.
